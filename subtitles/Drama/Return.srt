<i>- Hi, Mom!
- Hi!</i>

3
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:59,595
Hi!

4
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:02,666
Hi, baby.

5
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:08,378
Look at you.

6
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,039
<i>- Hi, baby.
- Yeah, she got big!</i>

7
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:12,740
She got big, yeah?

8
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:14,752
<i>- Baby, hi.
- Yeah.</i>

9
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:15,684
What do you say, sweetie?

10
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,847
Welcome home.

11
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,152
Oh.

12
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,487
Hi.

13
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:22,959
Hi, sweetie.

14
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,931
<i>- I love you.
- I love you so much.</i>

15
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:30,296
<i>I'll</i> pick you UP-

16
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:33,830
Oh, my God.

17
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,608
You feel so good.

18
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:43,847
All right, all right.

19
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:45,382
Here, let me get that, let me get that.

20
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,781
- I got it.
- All right.

21
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:26,182
You sleep on the plane?

22
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,487
- Mm-hmm, a little bit.
<i>-</i> That's good.

23
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,550
I couldn't sleep a lot, though, I was excited.

24
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,153
- Yeah, I bet.
<i>-</i> Yeah.

25
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,148
Hey, can you plate the chicken, please?

26
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,211
Oh, my God, I missed you.

27
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,019
And Mike was such a rock star.

28
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,252
I saw him all the time at the Kroger's

29
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:09,384
with Brie in the basket.

30
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,360
You would have been really proud of him.

31
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,920
And Missy said he was great
at spouse group, weren't you?

32
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,489
Come on, watch the hair!

33
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,933
<i>- Hey, can I have a glass?
- Sorry.</i>

34
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,271
Mike!

35
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,169
Oh, my God, this looks so good.

36
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,405
- My favourite...
<i>-</i> That's my addiction there...

37
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:29,879
Go ahead.

38
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,108
Here, can you hold this, please?

39
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,649
Go ahead, turn, turn, turn, turn.

40
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:33,843
Let's see what you got, let's see what you got.

41
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:34,748
Now do me.

42
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:36,081
Oh!

43
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,915
Look at you.

44
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:40,252
Oh, you're getting heavy.

45
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,624
I'm gonna dip you.

46
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:45,458
- Flip me!
<i>-</i> Flip you?

47
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:46,656
Oh, my...

48
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,823
How am I going to flip you?

49
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:48,957
You're getting so big!

50
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,399
Let's let Mom rest, okay, here, here.

51
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,457
But Mom loves dancing.

52
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:54,061
I know, but it's time for her to relax.

53
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,404
You guys, it is so nice to have your own

54
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,340
fucking chair and a beer.

55
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,401
Dollar in the curse jar.

56
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,176
And she's still doing Bingo on the weekends,

57
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,774
and so she's wasting all her money there

58
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,546
and she's still working at the grocery store.

59
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,815
And this guy, he doesn't make anything.

60
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,049
So with this new husband,

61
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,022
she keeps borrowing from us all the time.

62
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,287
And I-- I let her
borrow the car.

63
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:19,057
She had to go out and roll it, though.

64
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:21,189
Damn... totaled it!

65
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,063
So she writes me this letter.

66
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:27,127
I mean, she's my own mother,
but she mails it to me,

67
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:28,866
saying she's going to pay for it.

68
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,169
Like I don't have a telephone, okay?

69
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,301
Can you believe this?

70
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,039
Of course, I haven't seen a red cent.

71
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,673
Yup, I knew it.

72
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,311
I've been dealing with this all over town.

73
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,118
It's not us, it's the city pipes, you know?

74
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,749
They're all rusted out.

75
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:24,294
Doris Norman's got six bathrooms.

76
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,194
Took me five hours to set her up.

77
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:28,596
<i>- Nice.
- Yeah.</i>

78
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,292
Well, she said I could charge
her for the whole day.

79
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:32,962
<i>- Seriously?
- Yeah, so I did.</i>

80
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,436
<i>- Nice.
- Yeah.</i>

81
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:41,401
<i>Hmm?</i>

82
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:45,113
That's nice.

83
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,172
What?

84
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,750
<i>-</i> You're crazy.
- Mm-hmm.

85
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,115
Oh, now, hang on.

86
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,490
I don't have this on yet.

87
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:57,550
Ah, shit, shit.

88
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:58,459
<i>- No, no, no, no, no...
- What?</i>

89
00:06:58,518 --> 00:06:59,724
No, no, no, no.

90
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,993
No.

91
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:05,001
They say you got to take it slow first.

92
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,537
Who's "they"?

93
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,833
The spouse group.

94
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,341
That's what they said!

95
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,036
<i>- Are you serious?
- They're very serious.</i>

96
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,976
No.

97
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,809
They don't know everything.

98
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,109
Oh, God, hon--

99
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,673
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm almost finished.

100
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,377
You better be careful, I'm almost done.

101
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,421
Oh, shit, shit.

102
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:24,546
Hey-

103
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:36,965
<i>- Come on.
- Okay.</i>

104
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,104
Wait, I forgot to put this back on.

105
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,503
Get over here!

106
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,724
What are you doing?

107
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,919
I'm just...

108
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,087
making sure she's breathing.

109
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,999
Check me, too?

110
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,194
Okay.

111
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:21,502
You're definitely breathing.

112
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,478
You go back to sleep, okay?

113
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:24,844
Okay.

114
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,098
It's like falling off a bike.

115
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,190
Yeah.

116
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:19,827
Everything seems so small.

117
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,599
What are you talking about?

118
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,641
It's exactly the same as when you left.

119
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,575
Yeah, but over there...

120
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:27,838
quantities.

121
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,106
Gigantic.

122
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:31,808
Then how did you lift it?

123
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,775
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

124
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:39,721
What did you have, like, a gigantic forklift?

125
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,520
All right, maybe the boxes are the same size,

126
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,151
but there is a lot of them.

127
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,126
Slow down, you're making me look bad.

128
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,670
All right, Brie.

129
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,824
Get in your seat like a big girl.

130
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:24,994
What?

131
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,284

00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,708
<i>-</i> Smile!
- That's my girl.

169
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,141
Yes!

170
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:38,521
Aw, thank you, baby.

171
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:41,030
We got more ketchup, if anyone
needs any more ketchup.

172
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,429
He made it.

173
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,558
<i>Be careful...</i>

174
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,838
<i>Hey, stop, hey-</i>

175
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:00,210
You think these walls are too yellow?

176
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:03,344
I could give it a coat
with a lighter-colored paint.

177
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:06,989
You know?

178
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,287
Look, Ma, she's about to fall over.

179
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:14,587
Ooh!

180
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,633
Ooh, you called that one, Jackie.

181
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,362
<i>You all right, Adam?</i>

182

184
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:23,603
Oh.

00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:25,835
Uh-oh.

186
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:28,105
- Hey
- Oh!

187

You Okay?

188
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:32,707
What's that?

189
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:34,978
You want to show me that?

190
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,383
Brie.

191
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,786
Hey-

192
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,380
<i>Hmm?</i>

193
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,483
What's she doing?

194
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,583
Nothing.

195
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,356
She just does that.

196
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:56,332
<i>I think he's trying to
tell you he wants you to put...</i>

<i>- You done with this, hon?
- Uh-huh.</i>

198
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,938
Oh, honey, don't worry about that.

199
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,377
I'll do it later, okay?

200
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:05,005
Aren't you going out with your girls tonight?

201
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,348
Yeah, I guess I better get dressed.

202
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,182
Yeah.

203
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,312
Go have fun.

204
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,151
Cheers it, cheers it.

205
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:19,161
Yeah.

206
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:23,990

This one's on the house.

210
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,335
My house.

211
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,340
Drink wisely.

212
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,671

Hey, I'm Cara Lee.

216
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,846
Hi, I'm Kelli.

217
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:43,750
Cara Lee works at Lambert's
Chrysler Chevrolet now.

218
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,221
She moved down from Chillicothe.

219
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,349
I live real close to you.

220
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,860
I met your kids and stuff while you were gone.

221
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,021
<i>-</i> They are so great.
- Thanks.

222
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,999
I even watched them for him once.

223
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,899
There was a plumbing emergency or something.

224
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,666
Oh, that's really nice, I appreciate it.

225
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:02,865
Yeah.

226
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,868
Well, good night.

227
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,105
Yeah, you too.

228
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,682
Who is that?

229
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:21,725
Oh, my God, she's just some girl
that works at Lambert's.

230
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,758
Don't do that now.

231
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,659
No, I gotta get it even, stop it.

232
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:26,924
Ladies, woo!

233
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,795
These are for you.

234
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:31,425
These are from the bartender,
she's very proud of you, so...

235
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,361
Thanks.

236
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,030
Yeah, oh, yeah, check it out, they're new, too.

237
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,632
Except you
have to go, "Whoo!"

238
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,074
Do you work here now?

239
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:43,409
No, no, no, I'm just--just-
just helping out, you know?

240
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:48,247
So, uh, so, uh...

241
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,650
So any of you ladies got five bucks

242
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,551
for a guy who really needs it?

243
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,680
Vonnie.

244
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:53,883
Oh, my God, let us be, Vonnie, go away.

245
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,721
<i>- Five bucks.
- Go away.</i>

246
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,719
Bye.

247
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,864
What, is he, like, a volunteer now?

248
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:06,634
How does-- how does
my eyes look?

249
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,796
Good.

250
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,806
Ladies, how you doing tonight?

251
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,808
<i>- Hi.

Kelli.

253
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:02,415
What do you mean?

254
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,181
I came out the window, I don't know.

255
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,382
- What window?
<i>-</i> The bathroom.

256
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,095
Come on, come on, let's go back inside.

257
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,894
No, no, no, no, no.

258
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:17,331
I want to go home.

259
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:18,891
I am done.

260
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,027
I gotta go home.

261
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:22,965
Come on.

262
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:38,152
They say it helps--
it helps to talk about it.

263
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,712
What, who says that?

264
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,724
Come on, what, Jerry Springer?

265
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:46,958
Kelli, come on.

266
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,864
Seriously.

267
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:53,733
Other people had it a lot worse
than I did, I promise you.

268
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:01,036
I mean, yeah, I saw...

269
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:04,171
some dead people and...

270
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,544
there's weird shit there.

271
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:07,675
You know?

272
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:11,653
Mostly I saw a giant amount of supplies.

273
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,122
Did you ever see a plane full of rubber gloves?

274
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,592
Nope.

275
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:20,822
But, yeah...

276
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,457
there was weird shit there.

277
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,195
Really, really weird shit.

278
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,703
There's like tons of dead
animals on the side of the road

279
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,639
and everybody knows somebody...

280
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,974
Anyway

281
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:44,145
Now all the cups are where
the fucking plates should go

282
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,780
and it's...

283
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:48,051
weird.

284
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,121
Did you have an affair?

285
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,425
No!

286
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,830
Jesus, you guys and your stupid
fucking questions.

287
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,834
<i>Some of-- some of--</i>

288
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,236
some of those guys are hot.

289
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:44,013
Hey, Pfirty girl.

290
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,276
Hi, I made coffee.

291
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:47,180
Good for you.

292
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:48,775
<i>- Yeah, I need it.
- Yeah.</i>

293
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,046
Oh...

294
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,153
Did you sleep with the kids again last night?

295
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:54,383
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

296
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:56,050
Doesn't that hurt your back?

297
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:57,923
Eh...

298
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,519
A little.

299
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,134
Well, you know, the bed's nice.

300
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,430
You might like it.

301
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:19,678
Well, you better snap to it, soldier.

302
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,581
Eh!

303
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,380
Mike.

304
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:34,220
Oh, you're killing me.

305
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:35,424
Rough night?

306
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,220
This is fucking stupid.

307
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,852
What?

308
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:11,893
It's just a giant waste of time.

309
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,054
I can't do it any more.

310
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:20,166
<i>- What do you mean?
- I just can't do it.</i>

311
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:33,344
End of this month, it's gonna be
too late, you've gotta get...

312
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:34,975
Wait.

313
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,111
I can't.

314
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:38,449
What do you mean, what?

315
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,488
I can't.

316
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,089
What, Kelli?

317
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,924
What?

318
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,123
What, it can't even wait for me
to get off the phone?

319
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:50,188
<i>- I just can't do it.
- What can't you do?</i>

320
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:51,563
You can't do inventory, or shipping?

321
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:52,761
What'd I do?

322
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,361
What, did Ed say something wrong?

323
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:56,804
Suddenly you're the sensitive type?

324
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,398
I didn't say anything.

325
00:24:58,463 --> 00:24:59,635
Nah, it's not that.

326
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:01,735
I've kept your job open for a year,

327
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,213
you've been working for me for 12 years.

328
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,647
I would like to know the reason.

329
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:13,083
You're just upset.

330
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:45,349
Whoo!

331
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,548
Hee-hee!

332
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:48,022
Finally, babe, people in this town

333
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:50,252
need some god damn plumbing done.

334
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:51,988
Yeah!

335
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,429
Underground routing at Goodwin's Car Wash.

336
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:56,932
Underground, baby.

337
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:59,525
It's leaking, it's all shot
to shit, and they know it.

338
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,195
They know it's gonna cost them, too.

339
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:03,170
I tried to tell them about,
like, I'm sorry for 'em,

340
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,434
'know, real serious, <i>Y</i>

341
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:07,705
like I was worried about 'em, but they said yes!

342
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:08,938
All new pipes!

343
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:15,743
How was your day, how's work?

344
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:17,047
Ahh-- No, I got it.

345
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,382
<i>- I took the day off.
- Yeah.</i>

346
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:25,127
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

347
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:29,654
It's a whole--
it's a whole underground system.

348
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:32,463
I mean, it could take two weeks,
serious billable cash.

349
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:37,834
How come you didn't go to work?

350
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:39,603
No reason.

351
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:40,768
Personal day.

352
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,472
Yeah.

353
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:46,473
Yeah, you could use it.

354
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:47,710
Yeah.

355
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,410
Goddamn, I gotta get a beer.

356
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:02,354
Hey-

357
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,091
Finally got the girls to sleep.

358
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:11,639
Boy-

359
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,335
You all right?

360
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,647
Can I ask you some stuff?

361
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,883
Yeah.

362
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:28,219
Okay, what kind of stuff?

363
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,886
Well, you know, Shannon's been
real worried about you.

364
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,692
And...

365
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:42,762
Well, I just want you to know that...

366
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,307
I don't know, if...

367
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:48,833
if you did do something over there,

368
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,210
or saw something or did something

369
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,408
of a personal nature...

370
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:54,779
A personal nature?

371
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,649
Well, I just would rather know, okay?

372
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:03,053
I would rather know if you did,
I'm not saying you did.

373
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:04,320
Whatever.

374
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:06,862
I just-- I know all kinds of
things can happen...

375
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:12,929
like with your unit or anything.

376
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:16,495
Well, Shannon, sure as shit,
wouldn't understand anything.

377
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:17,801
I can tell you that right now.

378
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:21,207
What, Kel, understand what?

379
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:22,574
Nothing.

380
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:28,049
So that's it?

381
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,284
Yeah.

382
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,526
All right.

383
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:43,232
All right, there is this one thing

384
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:44,426
that I didn't tell you about

385
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:46,162
that I should have told you about before.

386
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:54,106
I don't know, I, uh, I just found...

387
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:59,506
I just-- it's stupid, but I
just-- I couldn't do it any more,

388
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,814
so... I quit.

389
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:07,123
You quit what, quit the Guard?

390
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:09,158
No, no, no, no, no, I still have that.

391
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:10,852
I <i>just--</i>

392
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,952
At the warehouse.

393
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:16,123
I quit.

394
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:17,564
You quit your job?

395
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:18,896
Yeah, it's not
my fault, I--

396
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:20,368
How is it not your fault?

397
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,530
It just doesn't mean anything,
you know, it doesn't matter.

398
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,904
It doesn't matter?

399
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:27,204
<i>- Really?
- No, that came out wrong.</i>

400
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,573
Kel, listen.

401
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:30,670
I've been playing
Mr. Mom over here, okay,

402
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:33,477
covered in fucking puke and baby shit

403
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,575
and we can't sit around
and hope that some asshole

404
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,880
gets enough hair in his shower

405
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,012
and needs me to come over and snake it out.

406
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:41,353
It does matter.

407
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:43,858
I think it matters.

408
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:47,158
You have no plan, okay?

409
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:48,754
You need to get a plan.

410
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,880
- Hey.
<i>-</i> Hi.

411
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,730
Come on.

412

<i>A man can't
kiss his own wife?</i>

413
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,034
- Come on.
- No...

414
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:20,048
<i>No, I'm sorry, this is not true.</i>

415
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:21,988
<i>This is not even a topic any more.</i>

416
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,925
<i>- We all agree on this--
- Yeah, we agree but we don't.</i>

417
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:15,671
I'm actually just calling

418
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:18,680
to let you know about a very special offer.

419
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:21,216
I'm in Ohio

420
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,842
Uh-huh.

421
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:25,080
<i>Oh, no, ma'am.</i>

422
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:28,989
Yes, I do know where Bangalore
is, and I am not there.

423
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,357
I'm here in the USA.

424
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,259
And I'm just calling to let you
know about an excellent value

00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:35,195

Don't you think it's a little much,

439
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:29,543
just hanging out in the living room all day?

440
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:30,984
It's okay.

441
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:40,724
It might be fine to get a job
outside the house, you know?

442
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,264
Yeah, like where?

Stop, Michael!

I don't like it.

You don't like it, you don't like it?

452

Oh, yeah, what about this?

453
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:54,632
Stop.

I don't know.

463
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:44,512
Hello.

464
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:46,054
Looking pretty empty in here.

465
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,147
Oh, yeah.

466
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:49,623
Hi, Kel, how are you?

467
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:55,425
I'd like to come back and work for you, sir.

468
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:59,161
And I've been thinking very long
and hard about my behaviour,

469
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:02,534
and I sincerely do apologize for how I acted

470
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:04,470
and I can understand if you're mad.

471
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,204
I really need a job.

472
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,772
Yeah, well...

473
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:16,718
Come here, I want to show you something.

474
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:21,556
I didn't think it would happen so fast.

475
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:24,422
We got a buyer for the land and it's not a lot.

476
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:28,962
Pays better than ventilators, so, uh...

477
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,193
so we're selling it off.

478
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:32,233
I mean, everything, too.

479
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,634
Everything's sold, even the shelves.

480
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:37,366
I don't who, but...

481
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:40,102
So it's just down to me and Ed now.

482
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:41,438
It's pretty far down.

483
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:46,245
Yeah.

484
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:47,783
There's something else I want to show you.

485
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:55,352
Come on over here.

486
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,490
Well...

487
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,625
hopefully you could sell those, too.

488
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:09,404
Are those yours?

489
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,633
<i>Yeah, mm-hmm.</i>

490
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:14,438
Yeah, my-- my wife won't let me
have them at home.

491
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:19,406
Do people even buy pigeons?

492
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,313
Yeah, well, you know, I--

493
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:22,908
I figured you can figure it out.

494
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:31,392
All right.

495
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,871
<i>What was your technique?</i>

496
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:20,465
<i>Well, the first one,
I think I took two bites of</i>

497
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:22,408

498
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,173
<i>and then I remembered about the dipping</i>

499
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:27,478
<i>because I had read online that
that's what they do in the...</i>

500
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:30,075
<i>The hot dog-eating contest, right, right.</i>

501
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:43,927
<i>Well, the dipping makes it more mushy,</i>

502
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,831
<i>like a pile of chocolate mush</i>

503
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,927
so it's easier to just swallow,
so you iust--

504
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,198
<i>You can almost drink it.</i>

505
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,568
<i>- Yeah.
- Well, Nancy-</i>

506
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,107
<i>Your-- her name is
Nancy Cummings.</i>

507
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,370
<i>You still hold the record of
17 cupcakes in five minutes.</i>

508
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:55,502
<i>Congratulations.</i>

509
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:56,806
<i>- Yay!
- Why thank you very much.</i>

510
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:57,709
So <i>proud.</i>

511
00:38:57,768 --> 00:38:59,441
<i>- All right.
- Okay.</i>

512
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,073
<i>You're a failure to...</i>

513
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:06,748
Hey-

514
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,211
You left the door wide open.

515
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,318
<i>- I saw your van.
- What about it?</i>

516
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:16,653
I saw your van today.

517
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:23,756
Hey, Kel, we were just talking.

518
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,460
Really?

519
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:28,902
What are you talking about?

520
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:30,666
Huh?

521
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:31,729
You talking about me?

522
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:36,173
No.

523
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:40,112
Oh, my God.

524
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:41,741
I thought you were just fucking her,

525
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:43,149
but you're talking to her, too.

526
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:44,584
Holy shit.

527
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:45,643
Kel, come on!

528
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,418
You know what, maybe--

529
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:52,859
I'm-- I'm-- I'm gonna go stay
with my mother...

530
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,021
for a while.

531
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,418
But I told the cops exactly who it was.

532
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,494
It's god damn Travis across the street.

533
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:31,158
I mean, he will come right up to
you and ask for money.

534
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,293
I wouldn't be surprised if I came home one day

535
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,234
and Robbie's PlayStation was gone.

536
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:36,669
But they didn't take that much from Peggy's,

537
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:39,003
they just-- they
trashed everything.

538
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:46,872
Maybe you should answer it.

539
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:48,245
It's just Mike.

540
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:50,945
Maybe it's important, he keeps calling you.

541
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,687
He's sleeping with that girl from the car place.

542
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:02,219
He's gonna stay at his mom's for a little while.

543
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:13,131
I'm so sorry, Kelli.

544
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,147
You all right?

545
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:29,616
What happened?

546
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:31,380
Um, I...

547
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,682
You hurt?

548
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:35,589
No?

549
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,489
Why don't you come on out and
come on to the back of my car?

550
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:43,426
You all right?

551
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:19,695
Well, they say you get your
license back eventually.

552
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:23,435
That's not what he said.

553
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,440
All right, let's talk about this tomorrow, okay?

554
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,407
You got to get your shit
together, my mom's in there.

555
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:29,375
I thought you were gonna go and
stay at your mom's house.

556
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:30,377
And do what with the kids?

557
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:33,313
You never came home.

558
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,213
He said I can go to some kind of

559
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:37,411
fucking clinic instead of jail.

560
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,053
Kelli, what are you doing?

561
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:42,590
I'm rolling up the window.

562
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,321
That's not my fault.

563
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:50,558
Okay.

564
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:51,895
You're welcome.

565
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,610
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

566
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:12,745
Uh-huh...

567
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:15,382
Yeah.

568
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:21,394
Six, seven...

569
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:25,996
Uh-huh.

570
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:33,703
Can I call you back?

571
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:39,977
Hi.

572
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:41,015
Hi.

573
00:45:48,378 --> 00:45:51,382
I'd like to get my...

574
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:54,429
window fixed on my car.

575
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,958
Okay.

576
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:00,627
Um, make and model?

577
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:03,228
'95 Escort station wagon.

578
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:12,241
I need a passenger glass on a '95 Escort...

579
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:14,077
Station wagon.

580
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:15,811
Station wagon.

581
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:16,977
It's a rush order.

582
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,485
It's not a rush order.

583
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:20,146
I'm not in any hurry.

584
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,452
You know, I think you'd be eligible for

585
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:30,123
the military discount.

586
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:32,328
No.

587
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:33,629
I don't want any charity.

588
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:36,762
It's a really good deal.

589
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:38,773
Can I get a manager over here

590
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:40,866
to authorize the military discount?

591
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:43,036
<i>- I said I don't want it.
- Okay.</i>

592
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,909
Okay?
I don't need any handouts.

593
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,142
All right.

594
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:56,954
Just your credit card then.

595
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:01,052
See, I gotta find one that's not broken.

596
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:08,036
Where-- where--
where you been?

597
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:12,032
Getting my shit done.

598
00:47:12,095 --> 00:47:13,165
Not that you care.

599
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:18,804
<i>- Look.
- What?</i>

600
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:21,907
I got the car fixed at Lambert's.

601
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:23,315
No big deal.

602
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:25,182
Hi, baby, hi.

603
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,551
Where's Jackie?

604
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:29,750
She's at church group.

605
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,889
Kelli, it's Tuesday.

606
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:35,259
Church group's on Monday.

607
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:40,193
- Shit.
<i>-</i> Yeah.

608
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:29,679
Jackie!

609
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,946
Oh!

610
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,948
You okay, baby?

611
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:38,015
Hi.

612
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:42,163
Thank you for finding her.

613
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:43,289
Why weren't they watching you?

614
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:44,855
I thought I could walk.

615
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,401
I'm big.

616
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:49,062
No, baby, you're not big.

617
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:53,836
Appreciate it, sir.

618
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:55,433
Come on.

619
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:56,307
Let's go home.

620
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:12,284
Well, do you live here or not?

621
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:14,720
Because every time I come home
or I wake up, you're here.

622
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:23,654
What are you doing?

623
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,528
You can't take all Brie's dishes.

624
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:26,033
What's she gonna eat off of?

625
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,472
I'm gonna take them for now, okay?

626
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:36,909
Just temporary.

627
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:40,642
And I'm letting you have them
unsupervised on the weekends

628
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,741
if you promise to focus,

629
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:45,309
you know, unless any more of
this bullshit happens.

630
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,911
You're letting me?

631
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:47,978
Yeah.

632
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:52,692
Emergency?

633
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:54,194
What the fuck is this, when did you get this?

634
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:56,026
Why would you say it's an emergency?

635
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:58,225
It's just what they call the order or whatever.

636
00:50:58,288 --> 00:50:59,289
Okay, just calm down.

637
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:00,391
Yeah, you wouldn't know an emergency

638
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:03,301
if it hit you in the fucking ass.

639
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,271
Are you fucking kidding me?

640
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:06,773
What the hell is wrong with you?

641
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:09,902
You left our child on the street
by Thompson Field.

642
00:51:09,966 --> 00:51:12,139
Do you know who hangs out down around there?

643
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:15,740
You're lucky she was still there
when you got back.

644
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:17,615
You're lucky the cops didn't take her from you

645
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:19,950
right then and there, okay?

646
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:23,716
I mean, half the time you just
walk around staring at the floor

647
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,088
like a freaking zombie.

648
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:27,685
At least I'm not fucking the Lambert lady!

649
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:35,193
Nobody gives a shit about the Lambert's lady.

650
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,101
You're here, okay?

651
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,230
You're back!

652
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:41,639
Be a goddamned mother!

653
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:44,971
Jesus.

654
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:57,020
Hi, um, I'm Kelli.

655
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:57,956
Hi, Kelli.

656
00:51:58,014 --> 00:51:59,288
Hi, Kelli.

657
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:00,692
Kelli, do you want to
take this time to admit that

658
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,424
you're powerless before alcohol?

659
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:07,936
Uh, I...

660
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:10,597
I don't know.

661
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,833
Why are you here?

662
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:14,432
Because I got a DUI.

663
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:22,541
But I, uh...

664
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:25,746
I'm... happy to be here

665
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:31,191
and to see people taking control
of their own lives...

666
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:33,023
you know?

667
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:36,659
Okay.

668
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:43,233
Hi, I'm Andrea.

669
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:44,067
Hi, Andrea.

670
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:45,470
Hi, Andrea.

671
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:47,475
It's not gonna be, like, crazy blonde, right?

672
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:49,841
Nah, I'm just doing pieces.

673
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,039
You just here for the three days?

674
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:54,480
Yeah, I guess.

675
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:56,540
I guess I got to go back.

676
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:58,142
You got a husband?

677
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:01,087
It's kind of hard to say right now.

678
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:03,249
<i>- Uh-oh.
- Yeah.</i>

679
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:06,226
He's trying to take my kids.

680
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:09,457
I guess he got really used to me being gone.

681
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,692
Where'd you go?

682
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:13,792
Uh, I was deployed.

683
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,200
Whoa.

684
00:53:15,258 --> 00:53:18,762
That sucks, and now he's leaving you?

685
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:20,637
YUP-

686
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:22,506
What were you doing there?

687
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:24,603
Re-supply

688
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:26,670
I was mostly on the base hospital.

689
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:28,841
Yeah...

690
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:30,748
A lot of people had it a lot worse.

691
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:34,050
You still love him?

692
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:40,428
It's weird.

693
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:43,727
I don't know.

694
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:46,131
I just, I really want things

695
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:48,692
just to be like they were before I left.

696
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:50,066
Oh, wow.

697
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:51,969
That ain't gonna happen.

698
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:54,030
You don't even know him.

699
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:57,670
I know, but that just never happens.

700
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:58,940
Except for that one time

701
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:01,983
when Superman flew around the world backwards

702
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:04,450
and that was just a movie.

703
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:07,750
I mean, that's what Franklin
says in group all the time.

704
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:11,657
I know he can be a dick,
but he's right about that.

705
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:13,490
Think about it.

706
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:29,872
Okay.

707
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,503
<i>- Sorry.
- That's okay.</i>

708
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:35,482
It's just you don't know shit
about my family, okay?

709
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:36,949
I know, you're right.

710
00:54:40,977 --> 00:54:42,251
Okay if I start you?

711
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:49,297
So you definitely don't want to use it

712
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:52,595
to avoid hearing what people are
telling you, though, you know?

713
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:53,726
Okay.

714
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:54,996
Bud?

715
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,432
I <i>pass.</i>

716
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:01,767
Kelli, what about you?

717
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:13,479
Um...

718
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:16,990
Well...

719
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:20,392
some stuff in my life really sucks right now

720
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:23,090
and, uh...

721
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:26,396
I shouldn't have gone on
a bender but... I did.

722
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:31,334
Okay.

723
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:34,841
Well, first, I'd like to make an observation.

724
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:37,674
I observe that, for a lot of us,

725
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:39,111
not just Kelli,

726
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:42,116
we're using alcohol and drugs
to respond to something else

727
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,311
that happened in our lives.

728
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:49,016
And a lot of times, if we can
just deal with our lives,

729
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,389
it can help us in our recovery.

730
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:54,019
So, Kelli, I would invite you

731
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:56,860
to talk to us about

732
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,059
whatever stuff that "sucks," as you put it.

733
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:07,574
Well, um...

734
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:11,669
things haven't been the same
since I got back from the war

735
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:14,113
and...

736
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:18,209
my husband is leaving me...

737
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:19,912
and that's why I got real drunk

738
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:21,455
and got a DUI,

739
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:24,788
but, um...

740
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:28,489
now he is taking my kids...

741
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,360
and that's the worst part.

742
00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:33,900
You know?

743
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:36,597
And all this stuff causes you to drink.

744
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:43,171
I don't know, I mean, a little, maybe, but...

745
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,577
I got a DUI, so...

746
00:56:45,635 --> 00:56:48,809
You know, it can be an important step

747
00:56:48,872 --> 00:56:53,412
to talk through whatever challenges or traumas

748
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:55,114
you might have encountered over there.

749
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:06,559
Kelli.

750
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:08,694
Telling your trauma is an important step.

751
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,872
I don't really have a story for you.

752
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,344
<i>- Which step is it?
- I beg your pardon?</i>

753
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:26,080
Which step, which step is it of the 12?

754
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:28,281
Well, it's not really one of
the steps, strictly speaking.

755
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:29,379
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

756
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,653
You ever fight?

757
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:34,092
Me? No.

758
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:35,322
Well, I'll tell you something,

759
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:37,023
next time I get a DUI, I'm taking jail time,

760
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:39,532
because you don't know shit
about what she's talking about.

761
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:51,703
Bye, babe.

762
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:52,940
Bye.

763
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:00,246
How long you staying?

764
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,914
You know, as long as they'll have me,

765
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:06,051
but I'm mandatory three more weeks.

766
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:08,026
They give you back all your stuff?

767
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:09,119
Yeah.

768
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:12,759
Thanks.

769
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:19,165
Look, darling.

770
00:58:22,198 --> 00:58:25,304
I'm not a cop or anything,
but you shouldn't be driving.

771
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:26,847
I know you got six months suspension

772
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:28,905
or you wouldn't be here.

773
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:32,146
You got to be squeaky clean
for the custody stuff.

774
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:33,778
You know, you walk in,

775
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:36,380
you file your thing, you walk out.

776
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:39,723
You go to family court, I want
to see you walking in there.

777
00:58:39,782 --> 00:58:41,819
Don't want to get arrested before that.

778
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,971
You got to stay in the present, babe!

779
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:08,238
Hi.

780
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:15,518
Okay, it's $12 for processing

781
01:00:15,578 --> 01:00:17,319
and I need to see your license.

782
01:00:24,153 --> 01:00:25,496
Can you tell me

783
01:00:25,555 --> 01:00:27,933
where the office for family court is, please?

784
01:00:27,991 --> 01:00:30,335
It's upstairs and to your right.

785
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:43,982
Okay.

786
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:49,388
You've completed your
alternative to incarceration.

787
01:00:49,445 --> 01:00:53,689
You're eligible to get your
license back in six months,

788
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,663
provided you have no further offenses.

789
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:58,926
And since you can't drive,

790
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:00,865
you shouldn't have any more offenses.

791
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,771
Are you okay?

792
01:01:09,265 --> 01:01:12,075
We got mobilization orders.

793
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:13,307
I beg your pardon?

794
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:17,750
I have to go back.

795
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:26,044
All right, so...

796
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:27,349
be real good for your mom, okay?

797
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,412
She's had a rough time.

798
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:31,288
Okay?

799
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:32,291
All right.

800
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:35,762
All right then.

801
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:36,819
I love you.

802
01:02:36,886 --> 01:02:38,263
I love you, too.

803
01:02:38,321 --> 01:02:39,595
- Bye.
- Bye.

804
01:02:39,655 --> 01:02:41,134
Bye.

805
01:02:43,226 --> 01:02:44,534
I love you.

806
01:02:54,737 --> 01:02:56,307
Hi!

807
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:01,213
Hey. GUYS

808
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:02,517
Come in.

809
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:17,161
Your hair looks brighter.

810
01:03:17,226 --> 01:03:19,228
Yeah, yeah.

811
01:03:34,043 --> 01:03:35,351
Are you okay?

812
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:39,184
Yeah.

813
01:03:41,884 --> 01:03:44,728
Yeah, I'm okay.

814
01:03:44,787 --> 01:03:46,164
Are you okay?

815
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:47,326
Yeah.

816
01:03:51,627 --> 01:03:52,833
Look at you.

817
01:03:58,367 --> 01:03:59,607
<i>Let's make a mummy.</i>

818
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:12,293
First, let you out, Jackie.

819
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:14,089
Come on, we don't want to be late.

820
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:16,027
Close this one, lock it.

821
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:21,429
All right, away we go.

822
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:22,992
Okay.

823
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:24,663
<i>- Wanna play a game?
- Sure.</i>

824
01:04:26,495 --> 01:04:28,168
What do you want to play?

825
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:29,733
Let's walk like Frankenstein.

826
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:31,005
Walk like Frankenstein?

827
01:04:31,067 --> 01:04:31,909
All right.

828
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:33,106
Ready?

829
01:04:37,907 --> 01:04:40,046
Friend...

830
01:04:40,109 --> 01:04:43,522
Okay, now how about like a hunchie?

831
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:48,892
Na, na, na.

832
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:52,025
Okay, how about like a ballerina?

833
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:55,129
- A ballerina?
<i>-</i> Yeah.

834
01:04:58,594 --> 01:05:00,733
Five, six, seven, eight,

835
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:02,776
lean, one, two, shake,

836
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:04,937
three, four, turn,

837
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:09,381
five, six, step, seven, head whip.

838
01:05:09,438 --> 01:05:11,816
Hold it-- eight.

839
01:05:11,874 --> 01:05:14,286
All right, you guys look awesome, good job.

840
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:46,284
What's with the sheet?

841
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:47,650
<i>She's a mummy.</i>

842
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:49,815
Hey, little mummy.

843
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:51,324
Hi!

844
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:52,757
Come here, little mummy.

845
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:58,359
Come on, honey, get in the car.

846
01:05:58,421 --> 01:05:59,991
Can I stay with Mom?

847
01:06:00,056 --> 01:06:01,933
No, it's not her day.

848
01:06:04,193 --> 01:06:06,833
I'll see you on Friday, okay?

849
01:06:06,896 --> 01:06:08,398
You did good today.

850
01:07:13,896 --> 01:07:15,705
Fuck you!

851
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:21,482
Sorry, babe.

852
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:23,107
No, I...

853
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:24,515
Sorry.

854
01:07:24,573 --> 01:07:26,211
I was gonna give you a ride.

855
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:27,913
You live downtown?

856
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:30,253
Uh... yeah.

857
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:33,486
Come on.

858
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:36,389
All right.

859
01:07:57,273 --> 01:07:58,650
How'd you get your license back?

860
01:08:07,983 --> 01:08:09,860
Look at that bullshit.

861
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:12,229
Taking that lady's money for nothing.

862
01:08:12,288 --> 01:08:14,495
What a fucking racket.

863
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:16,127
Look at those two.

864
01:08:16,192 --> 01:08:18,604
They're obviously pigging out on some...

865
01:08:18,661 --> 01:08:22,131
doughnuts or cheap shit.

866
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:24,303
Skinny ones going home and throwing it up.

867
01:08:24,366 --> 01:08:26,004
The fat one maybe should.

868
01:08:26,068 --> 01:08:28,571
Then they got to eventually come back there

869
01:08:28,637 --> 01:08:30,207
spend even more money to work it off.

870
01:08:33,175 --> 01:08:34,916
Yeah, that's fucked up.

871
01:08:34,977 --> 01:08:36,047
Well, you must have gotten some perspective

872
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,614
while we were there anyway

873
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:40,058
about whether you can fit your
ass into a pair of pants or not.

874
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:42,494
Oh, I fit my ass in a pair of pants.

875
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:44,553
Yeah, I actually noticed that before.

876
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:50,101
You don't mind my saying so.

877
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:56,773
Jesus Christ, it must suck coming home

878
01:08:56,832 --> 01:08:59,813
with all these fucking Oprah
assholes up your <i>ass.</i>

879
01:08:59,869 --> 01:09:02,975
You know when I came back, nobody gave a shit.

880
01:09:03,038 --> 01:09:05,211
Nobody said a word...

881
01:09:05,274 --> 01:09:07,220
which sucked, in its own way,

882
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:09,347
but at least there wasn't anybody up my ass,

883
01:09:09,411 --> 01:09:11,550
trying to get me to tell 'em
what was it over there that

884
01:09:11,614 --> 01:09:13,616
happened that made you the kind of person

885
01:09:13,682 --> 01:09:15,753
who would walk his fucking cat on a leash.

886
01:09:17,419 --> 01:09:19,160
<i>Hmm, wow.</i>

887
01:09:23,025 --> 01:09:24,197
I'm called back.

888
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:28,709
Oh, shit.

889
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:32,209
Before my custody hearing.

890
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:33,508
Oh, fuck.

891
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:39,450
That sucks.

892
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:41,954
My uncle used to know some Quakers.

893
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,081
Word was, back in the day,

894
01:09:43,145 --> 01:09:46,217
they could run you up to Canada.

895
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:48,091
I don't know but that's what they say.

896
01:09:52,788 --> 01:09:55,667
Hey, you like, uh, venison?

897
01:09:58,928 --> 01:10:02,341
'Cause I got about two freezers full of it.

898
01:10:02,398 --> 01:10:04,503
I got a blind about a mile from my house.

899
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:10,373
What do you say?

900
01:10:12,775 --> 01:10:14,186
Why the fuck not?

901
01:10:27,489 --> 01:10:29,992
The john's outside.

902
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:32,039
How do you get electricity in here?

903
01:10:32,094 --> 01:10:35,371
I stole a line from the county.

904
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:38,002
I run the fridge and the deep freeze

905
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:41,173
and pretty much everything off that.

906
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:43,148
No plumbing, however.

907
01:10:45,107 --> 01:10:46,552
<i>- Wow.
- Yeah.</i>

908
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:03,729
Thank you.

909
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:06,705
I used to have a solar panel, for a while.

910
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:09,606
Some days you have juice, some days you don't.

911
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:12,043
Cloudy days I'd be reading by the fridge light.

912
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:19,381
Bunch of meth heads down there.

913
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:21,921
That shit will fuck you up.

914
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:23,718
Yeah, well, I know you're into the pure living.

915
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:29,018
You hungry?

916
01:11:29,084 --> 01:11:30,461
And then they do this--

917
01:11:30,519 --> 01:11:31,964
Oh, they do
this move--

918
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:34,023
and I gotta, I got to put
that down, it's like...

919
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:39,271
And it's just like a bunch of
six-year-old little kids

920
01:11:39,328 --> 01:11:42,070
doing it, and it's ridiculous.

921
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:43,109
It's like...

922
01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:44,337
Yes, but then you turn around...

923
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:45,970
- Terrible.
- and it's, like, two girls

924
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:47,673
doing it like this to each other.

925
01:11:47,736 --> 01:11:49,773
And it's so...

926
01:11:49,838 --> 01:11:50,509
Oh...

927
01:11:50,572 --> 01:11:51,607
Were you a cheerleader?

928
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:53,585
No, God no.

929
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:54,848
L...

930
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:56,253
Well, I like to dance or whatever,

931
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,189
but not for the whole town.

932
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:01,618
You want to show me some cheers?

933
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:02,719
<i>-</i> What?
- Mm-hmm.

934
01:12:02,785 --> 01:12:03,763
No!

935
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:05,696
Come on, show me some cheers.

936
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:06,892
Show me some cheers.

937
01:12:06,955 --> 01:12:09,458
You show me some cheers.

938
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:13,439
I will show you one more thing that she did.

939
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:14,769
She...

940
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:17,208
And the woman who teaches them is hilarious

941
01:12:17,266 --> 01:12:20,110
because she loves it so much.

942
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:23,878
And at the end of the cheer,
at the end of like every cheer,

943
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:25,111
they do this...

944
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:31,420
And they look real serious.

945
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:34,359
Aw, she's cute, though, she is really cute.

946
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:39,688
So you joined 'cause--
so they'd pay for college?

947
01:12:39,755 --> 01:12:40,961
Yeah, college,

948
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:45,472
but also, when I was a little kid, my aunt,

949
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:46,904
she lived in Adams County

950
01:12:46,962 --> 01:12:49,306
and they had this huge tornado
and they sent the Guard in,

951
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:52,073
and they were so cool.

952
01:12:52,134 --> 01:12:54,410
That's why you went in?

953
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:56,507
Yes, originally.

954
01:12:56,572 --> 01:12:57,949
Tornadoes.

955
01:12:58,006 --> 01:13:00,646
Yeah, a lot of people in my unit
joined for stuff like that.

956
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:08,951
That's rainwater.

957
01:13:09,017 --> 01:13:09,927
That's gross.

958
01:13:09,985 --> 01:13:11,396
It's clean.

959
01:13:11,453 --> 01:13:13,729
If you boil it.

960
01:13:13,789 --> 01:13:15,530
<i>- Really.
- All right, if you say so.</i>

961
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:20,596
Anyway, and then I never finished college.

962
01:13:20,662 --> 01:13:21,834
So...

963
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:24,942
Oh...

964
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,071
<i>-</i> Ooh.
- Mm-hmm.

965
01:13:27,136 --> 01:13:28,410
What about you?

966
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:35,184
My, uh, lawn mower ran out of gas.

967
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,814
Come on, seriously.

968
01:13:36,879 --> 01:13:39,985
It was one of those loud
pull-start lawn mowers

969
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:44,053
and it ran out of gas, so the engine cut out...

970
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:47,225
and if it had kept going,
I would have kept mowing.

971
01:13:47,289 --> 01:13:51,601
But it shut down, and I heard the phone ring.

972
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:55,301
Plus, the glass door was open

973
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:59,312
and the air conditioning wasn't on.

974
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:00,540
So because of all those things,

975
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:02,912
I went inside and answered the phone.

976
01:14:07,509 --> 01:14:09,182
And?

977
01:14:11,413 --> 01:14:13,013
And...

978
01:14:16,318 --> 01:14:17,763
it was the army recruiter.

979
01:15:53,181 --> 01:15:54,489
I can pull out.

980
01:15:56,585 --> 01:15:58,394
No, no, no, don't.

981
01:15:58,453 --> 01:15:59,830
<i>-</i> I can do it.
- Don't.

982
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:01,697
Don't, don't, don't.

983
01:16:01,757 --> 01:16:04,101
I want it, I want it.

984
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:05,229
I want it!

985
01:17:07,723 --> 01:17:09,703
I like your coffee thing, it's cool.

986
01:17:09,758 --> 01:17:10,828
Thanks, babe.

987
01:17:10,892 --> 01:17:12,894
<i>-</i> Do you want some?
- Mm-hmm.

988
01:17:28,076 --> 01:17:29,077
Here you go.

989
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:32,654
What is that?

990
01:17:34,349 --> 01:17:35,350
Oxy.

991
01:17:39,254 --> 01:17:41,791
You have a bad back or something?

992
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:43,734
Eh, not so much.

993
01:17:43,792 --> 01:17:47,069
These are...
just the pinks.

994
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:48,164
You can eat them,

995
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:51,973
but you got to eat a lot of these.

996
01:17:52,034 --> 01:17:53,445
Crushing them is better.

997
01:18:03,478 --> 01:18:06,459
Turns your snot pink but it's worth it.

998
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:12,694
I gotta... get home.

999
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:19,831
Think I can walk from here?

1000
01:18:19,895 --> 01:18:21,806
Uh, I can take you.

1001
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:25,636
You can just wait a little while.

1002
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:29,948
I'll be good in like a...

1003
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:31,313
like an hour?

1004
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:34,379
Hey, Travis.

1005
01:19:36,004 --> 01:19:38,450
I thought you and Mike broke up.

1006
01:19:38,507 --> 01:19:40,953
Just give me my fucking change.

1007
01:19:41,009 --> 01:19:42,352
You seeing anyone?

1008
01:19:44,412 --> 01:19:45,482
Not yet.

1009
01:19:47,215 --> 01:19:48,125
Take care.

1010
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:51,258
"Pointing downward, replace over cap

1011
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:54,596
and lay stick on a flat surface
with result window facing up."

1012
01:19:54,656 --> 01:19:55,896
Okay, I did that.

1013
01:19:55,957 --> 01:19:57,436
You gotta let the hormones
build up in there, Kel.

1014
01:19:57,492 --> 01:19:58,732
It takes a second.

1015
01:19:58,794 --> 01:19:59,966
Okay, So one line is pregnant

1016
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:02,474
and two lines is not pregnant, right?

1017
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:04,067
Ew, your pee is all over that thing.

1018
01:20:04,132 --> 01:20:05,611
Oh, fuck, Shannon.

1019
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:07,704
I can't believe you have two kids already.

1020
01:20:07,769 --> 01:20:11,342
Yeah, well, if I want to
Keep them, then I gotta be here,

1021
01:20:11,406 --> 01:20:14,444
I can't be in some fucking sandbox.

1022
01:20:14,509 --> 01:20:15,647
Are you being serious?

1023
01:20:17,879 --> 01:20:19,290
What the fuck happened to you over there?

1024
01:20:19,347 --> 01:20:20,519
You're acting crazy.

1025
01:20:23,118 --> 01:20:25,155
No, I'm not.

1026
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:26,290
Nothing happened to me.

1027
01:20:32,127 --> 01:20:33,470
I don't believe you.

1028
01:20:33,528 --> 01:20:34,632
Yeah?

1029
01:20:34,696 --> 01:20:36,698
Well, a lot of people had it a lot worse.

1030
01:20:36,765 --> 01:20:38,403
You know, I didn't
get raped in a Porta-Potty,

1031
01:20:38,466 --> 01:20:40,446
I didn't have to fucking carry a dead body,

1032
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:42,106
and I didn't get blown up by an IED,

1033
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:43,843
so I consider myself pretty lucky

1034
01:20:43,905 --> 01:20:46,408
because that's what happens over there, Brooke.

1035
01:20:46,474 --> 01:20:49,011
Yeah, well, something's wrong

1036
01:20:49,077 --> 01:20:50,920
because you're standing in a bar bathroom,

1037
01:20:50,979 --> 01:20:53,482
checking every five seconds
to see if you're pregnant yet,

1038
01:20:53,548 --> 01:20:56,188
which is the worst idea I have ever heard.

1039
01:20:59,387 --> 01:21:01,663
It would work.

1040
01:21:01,723 --> 01:21:03,066
You know?

1041
01:21:03,124 --> 01:21:04,569
It would work at least for a little bit.

1042
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:18,611
Hey, stranger.

1043
01:21:18,673 --> 01:21:20,346
Hey-

1044
01:21:20,408 --> 01:21:22,012
<i>- Hi, how are you?
- Hi.</i>

1045
01:21:22,077 --> 01:21:23,147
I'm good.

1046
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,156
You look good.

1047
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:28,023
Yeah.

1048
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:33,136
Hey, where are the kids?

1049
01:24:34,636 --> 01:24:36,638
Well, then you know what,
this is not funny, Mike.

1050
01:24:36,704 --> 01:24:38,308
I'm here waiting for them.

1051
01:24:40,108 --> 01:24:42,418
Yeah, well, it's basically against the law

1052
01:24:42,477 --> 01:24:43,421
if you don't give them to me.

1053
01:24:43,478 --> 01:24:44,786
It's like fucking kidnapping.

1054
01:24:48,149 --> 01:24:49,355
Fine, I'll be right there.

1055
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:10,575
This is a plumbing emergency?

1056
01:25:10,638 --> 01:25:13,016
Well, yeah, they're having a big party

1057
01:25:13,074 --> 01:25:14,849
and they got rust in their fountain.

1058
01:25:18,913 --> 01:25:20,324
Is it heated?

1059
01:25:20,381 --> 01:25:21,792
Yeah, it's hot enough.

1060
01:25:23,418 --> 01:25:24,795
They're all packed and ready to go.

1061
01:25:24,853 --> 01:25:26,457
They had lunch, so...

1062
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:33,333
You look good.

1063
01:25:37,866 --> 01:25:39,573
Yeah, I'm happy to see my kids.

1064
01:25:56,484 --> 01:25:57,724
You seem real good.

1065
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:02,893
I'm fine.

1066
01:26:20,475 --> 01:26:21,579
Hi, Mom.

1067
01:26:24,379 --> 01:26:26,290
All right, honey, here, take your stuff.

1068
01:26:26,347 --> 01:26:27,883
Let's get going

1069
01:26:27,949 --> 01:26:28,893
Come on, Brie.

1070
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:32,858
Time to go.

1071
01:26:38,293 --> 01:26:39,738
Ready to go with Mama?

1072
01:26:44,566 --> 01:26:45,567
All right.

1073
01:26:45,633 --> 01:26:47,579
<i>- Got everything?
- Yup.</i>

1074
01:26:51,239 --> 01:26:52,479
What?

1075
01:26:53,608 --> 01:26:56,282
Nothing.

1076
01:26:56,344 --> 01:26:58,756
You girls say goodbye to your dad.

1077
01:26:58,813 --> 01:27:00,724
<i>- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, honey.</i>

1078
01:27:11,793 --> 01:27:14,330
You know, I think this will
look good with your eyes.

1079
01:27:14,395 --> 01:27:15,806
Well, that's good.

1080
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:19,003
Jackie...

1081
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:21,946
now you're gonna be the only
one who doesn't have dark hair.

1082
01:27:22,003 --> 01:27:24,540
Aren't you gonna wish you had brown hair?

1083
01:27:24,606 --> 01:27:27,086
No, I like my hair blonde.

1084
01:27:27,141 --> 01:27:29,917
I don't know, it'd be kind of
fun if we all matched.

1085
01:27:29,978 --> 01:27:31,480
Don't you think?

1086
01:27:31,546 --> 01:27:32,650
Okay.

1087
01:27:32,714 --> 01:27:36,526
Well, hair dye is for grownups, babe.

1088
01:27:36,584 --> 01:27:38,962
No, it's okay.

1089
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:41,261
Yeah, she can have it.

1090
01:27:43,558 --> 01:27:44,901
Okay.

1091
01:27:44,959 --> 01:27:45,801
Come on.

1092
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:46,861
Oh...

1093
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:48,032
Oh.

1094
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:50,303
All right, we have to get your hair wet.

1095
01:27:52,867 --> 01:27:55,143
Can you go on your tippy toes?

1096
01:27:55,203 --> 01:27:56,443
You have very pretty hair.

1101
01:28:48,456 --> 01:28:52,165
Is old school like school for old people?

1102
01:28:52,226 --> 01:28:53,569
Not really.

1103
01:28:57,832 --> 01:29:00,608
Where are we going?

1104
01:29:00,668 --> 01:29:01,738
North.

1105
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:08,319
Will we be back in time for school?

1106
01:29:08,376 --> 01:29:10,014
I thought you hated school.

1107
01:29:10,078 --> 01:29:11,250
Well, not Ms. Riley.

1108
01:29:11,312 --> 01:29:12,814
I don't hate her.

1109
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,826

1110
01:29:14,882 --> 01:29:16,418

Next week we have a math test.

1113
01:29:21,622 --> 01:29:24,728
And it's Spirit Week, which
means very exiting stuff.

1114
01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:29,937
Like what kind of stuff?

1115
01:29:29,997 --> 01:29:32,500
Like pyramids, for example.

1116
01:29:32,567 --> 01:29:34,672
