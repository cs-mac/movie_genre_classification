1
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,489
My name is Tom Warshaw.

2
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,088
I'm an American artist
living in Paris.

3
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,579
I've lived here for 30 years

4
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,169
with a secret
that nobody knows.

5
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,452
My son, Odell,
is turning 13 today.

6
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,056
And for his birthday,
I'm gonna tell him my secret.

7
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,654
I'm gonna tell him,
'You know how in old movies

8
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,175
when the bad guys want
to break into a safe?

9
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,693
There's this one guy,
the safecracker,

10
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,816
who puts his ear
up to the lock

11
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,454
and listens as he dials
the combination,

12
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,293
listening for what they call
in English, the tumblers.

13
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,735
Because when the number
is right, there's a click,

14
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,812
and he knows with the click,
he's breaking in.

15
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,976
Well, in a man's life,
there's a tumbler too.

16
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,410
And I think
that number is 13,

17
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,731
when there's a click
and a boy breaks into manhood.

18
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,534
And the safe of his life
opens up and Shazam,

19
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,454
there are all the riches of what a man can
hope for and hope to be."

20
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,339
What I want
to say to my son is,

21
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,810
the opposite thing happened
for me when I turned 13.

22
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,336
Instead of opening,
the safe locked shut on me.

23
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,451
Because of certain things
that happened,

24
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,895
I couldn't hear
the tumblers anymore.

25
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,609
Now that he's turning 13,
I'm hearing the tumblers again.

26
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,017
Maybe it's like
we're becoming men together.

27
00:02:56,847 --> 00:02:57,847

Sorry to wake you. I'm just trying

42
00:03:53,053 --> 00:03:55,053
I was born in Greenwich Village,
New York City, New York,

43
00:03:55,054 --> 00:03:56,854
the United States of America.

00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,556
My story starts where
every man's story starts.

50
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,454
With Mom.

51
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,996
Sorry I'm late.

52
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,131
I made supper for us.

53
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,177
It's cold.
I'll heat it up.

54
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,471
No. It's okay.
It looks good.

55
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,737
My father had died
a year earlier of cancer.

56
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:42,498
My mom was a nurse.

57
00:04:42,764 --> 00:04:45,836
She was convinced that all such
disease could be prevented

58
00:04:45,837 --> 00:04:48,356
by mammoth intakes
of leafy, green vegetables.

59
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,275
Specifically, she believed
in the magic of the brussels sprout.

60
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,450
Are you gonna finish
your brussels sprouts?

61
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,008
I don't know, Mom.
I just started.

62
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,972
- If you want, I'll heat them up.
- No.

63
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,930
Fine.

64
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,251
She was lost
without my father.

65
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,050
But sometimes
I could find her.

66
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,053
Oh, Mom, now that's
what I call a brussels sprout.

67
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,131
Oh! Just melts in your mouth.

68
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,929
I don't know what Brussels was
thinking letting go of these.

69
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,849
And sometimes
she didn't want to be found.

70
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:30,970
Eighteen.

71
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,138
Twenty take away two
equals eighteen.

72
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,212
Okay, Mom.

73
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,313
How was school?

74
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,898
Fine.

75
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,134
How was work?

76
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,653
Fine.

77
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,534
- Want me to wash your hair?
- No, thanks.

78
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,768
Save me some hot water,
will you?

79
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,532
Sometimes she cried herself
to sleep.

80
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,695
Sometimes she just cried.

81
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,277
On those nights, the only way
to reach her was through

82
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,295
her hatred of our president,
Richard Milhous Nixon,

83
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,533
whose nickname, Tricky Dick...

84
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,452
It's Tricky Dick.

85
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,848
I am not a crook.

86
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,931
...inspired me to come up with

87
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,136
novel uses for my socks
and shirts.

88
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,950
Watergate, schmatergate.
That's all I have to say.

89
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,891
My fellow Americans,

90
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,611
I am not a crook.

91
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,834
My best friend's name
was Pappass.

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,560
He was what you used
to call "retarded."

93
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:12,738
We had a delivery boy job together.

94
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,751
If you wanted
wet toilet paper delivered

95
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,436
to the back of your head,
we were your guys.

96
00:07:17,556 --> 00:07:19,865
If I wanna exercise
my God-given freedom

97
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,974
to experience people
getting cut up by chainsaws

98
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,414
and hung on meat hooks,

99
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,458
I think I have the constitutional right
to do so, don't you?

100
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,850
- We're gonna go to jail, Tommy.
- Pappass.

101
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,698
We're not gonna go to jail.

102
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,691
- No?
- They don't throw retards in jail.

103
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,016
Just stay cool
and give me the dad-face.

104
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,778
Okay?

105
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,178
- Everything will be okay.
- Yeah.

106
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,773
Two for the Texas Chainsaw
Massa-cree, please.

107
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,176
Two for the Texas Chainsaw
Massa-cree, please.

108
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,494
It's R, small-fry.

109
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,855
No one under 16 without
parent or guardian.

110
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,574
Oh, that's my parent
or guardian right there.

111
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,650
Enjoy the cinema.

112
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,656
Thank you.

113
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,848
Thanks!

114
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,250
Greenwich Village
Chainsaw Massa-cree!

115
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,214
- Time for school.
- Yeah!

116
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,608
Who wrote Yellow Mattress?

117
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,054
I.P. Nightly.

118
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,573
Uh, Yellow River?

119
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,139
I.P. Daily.

120
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,699
Um, French Rupture?

121
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,454
Oh, oh, Jacques Tootight.

122
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,729
Russian Rupture?

123
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,693
Ivanna Kutcharakov.

124
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,293
Oh, don't do that!

125
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,731
Sorry we're late, Simone.

126
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,128
Sorry about that.

127
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,097
What do I care
if you watch movies after school?

128
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,090
I'm not your mother.

129
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,535
How did you know
we were at the movies?

130
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,258
How do I know?

131
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,056
And the retarded one
still has an erection.

132
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,019
I love scary movies.

133
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,818
Psyche.
It's like a Blimpie.

134
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,732
Slava bogu,
it's like a Bratwurst.

135
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,691
You could sell it by the pound.

136
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,651
Come here.
You're a good boy.

137
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,257
Tommy, too.
Tommy wants to say his prayers.

138
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,529
Ah, Simone.
My first boss.

139
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,577
Well, at least
part of Simone, anyway.

140
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,414
I think this is where
my love of French began.

141
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,288
People love delivery boys.

142
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,172
And dogs loved the bike.

143
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:51,858
- Hut!
- Maybe we were beloved

144
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:53,342
****************

145
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,843
because we took ourjob
so seriously.

146
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:55,844
It's Mick Jagger.

147
00:09:57,868 --> 00:09:58,924
We even offered a service we
called "tenderizing the meat."

148
00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:00,449
****************

149
00:10:02,115 --> 00:10:03,431
Our number one concern,
of course,

150
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,041
was to deliver the meat
on time.

151
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:09,156
Get back here!

152
00:10:09,256 --> 00:10:11,050
Slow motion!

153
00:10:28,915 --> 00:10:31,087
- Delivery, Mrs. Brevoort.
- Jack?

154
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:33,060
- Is that you, son?
- No, Mrs. Brevoort.

155
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,311
It's Tommy and Pappass
from Simone's.

156
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,329
We have your meat.

157
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,013
Oh, boys. Hello.

158
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,533
- Hello.
- Hello.

159
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,496
How much?

160
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,332
Um, five pounds.
69 cents a pound.

161
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,814
Three, four, five.
Three, four, five.

162
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,170
- Three dollars and...
- 45 cents for the ground chuck.

163
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,654
But at this price, Mrs. B.,

164
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,897
we like to refer to him
as "ground Charles."

165
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,575
"Ground Charles."
Oh, you're a clever boy.

166
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,538
And you've grown so.
How old are you now?

167
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,809
- Thirteen.
- Twelve, liar.

168
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,572
Thirteen in a couple weeks,
Papp-ass.

169
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,935
I'm 41.

170
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,297
Don't be in such a hurry
to get old. It's no fun.

171
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,257
And here's a dollar
for you.

172
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,980
Actually, Mrs. Brevoort,
that's a ten.

173
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,619
Here's a one.

174
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,971
A dollar for a kiss
from Thomas.

175
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,932
And a dollar
for a kiss from Papp-ass.

176
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,459
Papp-ass.

177
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,179
Thank you,
Mrs. Brevoort.

178
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,329
Good boy.

179
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,733
You boys need a tip?

180
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,576
Please.

181
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,732
Okay, come on now.

182
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,898
We buried some of
our delivery tips

183
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,732
outside the Women's
House of D.,

184
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,573
a prison for women on
10th Street and 6th Avenue,

185
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,691
so Pappass's dad didn't take
all of our money.

186
00:12:10,892 --> 00:12:11,892
I guess we figured
it was a safe place

187
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,494
because the women
were already locked up.

188
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,935
Sometimes we just came
for the conversation

189
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,170
between the ladies
and their admirers down below.

190
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,848
You gotta bail me outta here, daddy.
C'mon, I'm scared.

191
00:12:20,849 --> 00:12:21,849
********************

192
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,134
I don't know about that, mama.

193
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,490
Look like you're gonna have
to spend the night.

194
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,180
I don't have the money at hand.
This here is for skin.

195
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,571
- You got to get me out of here!
- I don't wanna argue with you.

196
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,571
- Don't walk away from me!
- I'm through!

197
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,332
I see your hat down there!

198
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,378
Eight, fifteen.

199
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,093
We did good today,
horn-dog.

200
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,368
About 40 bucks to go

201
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,929
and the beautiful, green lady
will be ours.

202
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,812
You got any more dimes in there?

203
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,329
No, I'm doing quarters.

204
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,619
Don't be such a specialist.

205
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,692
Branch out into dimes, Pappass.
You might like it.

206
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,819
The beautiful, green lady.

207
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,535
Park and lock, Thomas.

208
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,928
Okay, good.

209
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,494
Go ahead.

210
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,579
Oh, yeah.

211
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,412
People are getting cheap
with the tips

212
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,218
or you boys went
to the movies.

213
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,415
Hey, haven't you heard?

214
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,457
Nixon says
we're in a recession.

215
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,373
Inflation, oil embargo,
Yankees in the cellar...

216
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,859
Horace Clark's at second base.

217
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,488
Garbage strike, transit strike,
fiscal crisis.

218
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,695
- All right.
- Suburban flight,

219
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,088
- soft rock, art rock,
- All right.

220
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,533
- All right, already!
- Emerson, Lake and Palmer.

221
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,895
These are signs of the apocalypse,
I'm telling you.

222
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,693
You know why
your mother died, son?

223
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,698
She killed herself because
she had a retarded son.

224
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,215
- Isn't that right?
- She got hit by a car.

225
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,338
She walked in front of a car
because she had a retarded son.

226
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,615
She was drunk.

227
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,658
She was drunk
because her son's retarded.

228
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,732
She was drunk 'cause she was
married to you, you loser.

229
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,094
Up yours.

230
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,579
Up yours, too.

231
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,300
Up yours too, sir.

232
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,530
"Up yours too, sir"
and good night.

233
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,616
Bye-bye.

234
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,695
Not until you can pass
the driver's test.

235
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,813
When you can drive,
then you can drink.

236
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,891
- Yo.
- Yo, who?

237
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:11,856
Yo mama!

238
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,655
Fat ass!
Go! Come on!

239
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,538
Our French teacher,
Madame Chiakipet.

240
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,053
Monsieur Warshaw?

241
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,414
Oui.

242
00:15:22,415 --> 00:15:23,415
*************************

243
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,411
Um, I don't think so.

244
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,411
Use "le bonheur" in a sentence
s'il vous plait.

245
00:15:32,485 --> 00:15:34,912
****************************

246
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,134
Our soul mission in life
was to make her say

247
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,177
dirty words without knowing
what she was saying.

248
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,178
You have magnificent bonheur?

249
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,456
- No, no, no.
- Oui, oui, oui.

250
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,736
Sometimes we could get her to say
some pretty cool things.

251
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,094
- Le bonheur, uh...

252
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,378
Good time, no?
Le bonheur is happiness.

253
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,736
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah, but...

254
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,618
I'm sorry.
If I may correct you.

255
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,896
In English, we say "hap-penis."

256
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,738
"Hap-penis"?

257
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,650
Hap-penis.

258
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,775
- Hap-"penis".
- Penis.

259
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,811
- "Penis"?
- Penis.

260
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,135
- "Penis."
- Penis!

261
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,693
Bon. Okay.
I have the "penis."

262
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,253
Okay.

263
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,854
Please, Monsieur Warshaw.

264
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,294
You are my best student.

265
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,654
Please focus.

266
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,139
What?

267
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,609
- Focus.
- Fuck what?

268
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,929
- Focus!
- Us?

269
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,568
Foc-us!
Foc-us!

270
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,332
Come on, come on!

271
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,094
Will you just focus
and give me the bonheur?

272
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,500
Strike one!

273
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,729
That was a ball!

274
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,299
Caught the corner!

275
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,291
Talk to the chalk.

276
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,416
Go again! Play ball!

277
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,895
Ball!

278
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,772
Strike two!

279
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,220
Oh, bean ball! Rule 6.08B!

280
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,650
"A batter is hit by a ball
he is not attempting to hit.

281
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,736
Take your base."

282
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:46,218
St. George leads St. Andrews
19-18. Play ball!

283
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,819
Time-out.

284
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,969
Time-out.
Time-out.

285
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,017
Time-out.
We're gonna get a pinch-hitter.

286
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,579
- Pappass, get in there.
- What?

287
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,856
Pappass is on our team.
He's gonna pinch-hit.

288
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,293
He's too old.

289
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,813
- Yeah.
- He goes to our school.

290
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,658
Pappass, show him your I.D.

291
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,173
All right.

292
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,530
St. Andrews School.

293
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,372
That's only because
you're retarded.

294
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,297
Don't use that word, Spaz.

295
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,449
Well, he is, Melissa.

296
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,178
Doesn't make it right.

297
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,450
All right.
Let him hit.

298
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,651
One more strike
and we win anyway.

299
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,016
I'll just throw the cheese
right by him.

300
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,778
Come on, Pappass!
Let's go!

301
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,135
Come on, Mark!
Strike out the retard!

302
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:26,088
No bagel, baby!
Look at the 'tard!

303
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,218
Mark, you can beat the retard!

304
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,095
You're standing on the plate.

305
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,619
- Easy out!
- The plate!

306
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,738
You knucklehead.
You're right in front of it.

307
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,375
Strike him out!

308
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,854
Retard!

309
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,819
Mickey Mantle, Pappass.
Mickey Mantle.

310
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,935
Yeah!

311
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,848
Oh, no!

312
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,778
Run for it!

313
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,732
Get your balls out of my window,
you little creeps!

314
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,457
Maybe you guys should
get your own retard!

315
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,253
- Two in a row!
- No!

316
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:28,651
How come you go to an all-boys school?
That's for losers, man.

317
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,613
We like girls.
We like the girls at your school.

318
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,532
How about Melissa Loggia?

319
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,736
I saw you checkin'
her out today, Tommy.

320
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,094
Tommy don't like girls.

321
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,730
Tommy don't like girls.
He likes his own hand.

322
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,551
- Come on, Tommy. We all know you like her.
- Ah, she's flat.

323
00:19:42,552 --> 00:19:43,852
******************

324
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,214
Pirate's dream... sunken chest.

325
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,378
Carpentry...
flat as a board and easy to screw.

326
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,457
I've seen bigger lumps in oatmeal.

327
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,889
Tommy don't like girls.

328
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,014
30, 31, 32, 33...

329
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,170
Good night, Ma.

330
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,879
Under the bed, I felt safe
'cause I knew she was safe.

331
00:20:45,943 --> 00:20:46,943
**************

332
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:54,336
As long as I could hear
her breathing, I could breathe.

333
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,889
And I could draw.

334
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,649
Because of some
bureaucratic shenanigans

335
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,334
and some nonsense
in the U.S. Constitution

336
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,695
called the separation
of Church and State

337
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,455
this class will no longer
be called Bible Study.

338
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,292
It will be called Ethics.

339
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,197
Well, that's my civic duty done.
Now open your Bibles, boys, to Genesis 19:4...

340
00:21:15,198 --> 00:21:17,898
*********************

341
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:21,257
Lot and his salty spouse.

342
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:24,935
"And there came two angels to Sodom that
evening..." blah, blah, blah...

343
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,773
"All the men of Sodom surrounded Lot's house
and demanded,

344
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,255
"'Where are the men
who came to you tonight?

345
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,689
Bring them out to us so that
we can have sex with them."'

346
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,089
Now don't get too excited, boys.
The story goes straight downhill from here.

347
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,090
And now pitching

348
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,250
for the Yankees,

349
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,854
Mel-l-I

350
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:53,012
Stottlemyre.

351
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,296
The vegetation
that grew from the ground.

352
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,649
Question...

353
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,414
What was left after

354
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,411
Lot's house was razed?

355
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,615
Answer?

356
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,810
Lot's lot.

357
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,857
Anyhoo...

358
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,611
"But Lot's wife looked back longingly and was
turned into a pillar of salt."

359
00:22:15,612 --> 00:22:18,112
*********************

360
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,457
Why?

361
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,377
Was God's soup too bland?

362
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,976
No.
What does salt do?

363
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,490
It preserves things.

364
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,412
It keeps things
from changing.

365
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:45,653
Salt holds on.
She looked back "longingly."

366
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:49,051
Well, surely it means that we should not be
attached to possessions

367
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,892
and the things
of this world, no?

368
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:55,611
Lot's wife looked back
because she missed her stuff.

369
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,611
And for that immature longing,

370
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,340
she was made into
a thing of bitterness...

371
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,008
a pillar of salt.

372
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:05,535
Ice cream. "Pumping"pies.

373
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,577
- What kind of pies?
- Pumpkin.

374
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,095
In your store, you feature 109 different
ice-cream flavors.

375
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,812
Small balls.

376
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,255
How would you like it if
we said you had small balls?

377
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,739
- What?
- Small balls.

378
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,209
You said Melissa was flat.
Small balls?

379
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,850
Small balls, small balls,
small balls with a basketball.

380
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,177
Small balls! Small balls!

381
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,058
Small balls!

382
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:48,692
You gonna eat that brussels
sprout orjust hypnotize it?

383
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,691
I don't know, Mom.

384
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,618
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

385
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,334
- You sure?
- I'm fine.

386
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,216
How was school today?

387
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,336
- Fine.
- Fine?

388
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,051
Yeah.

389
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,489
My monosyllabic son.

390
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:23,216
You never talk to me anymore.
How come you don't talk to me?

391
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,575
- I talk to you, Mom.
- You don't, you know.

392
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,696
Mom, l...
We're talking now, aren't we?

393
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,249
Don't be funny.

394
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,168
I feel like a leper around you.

395
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,371
Mom...

396
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:47,376
Listen, I really can't go
back to that school anymore.

397
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,496
St. Andrew's?
What are you talking about?

398
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,059
We have to move.

399
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,859
I did something bad.
I said something,

400
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,612
and they hate me there.

401
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,611
And the girls really,
really don't like me.

402
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,372
What are you doing
with girls?

403
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,012
That's not the point, Mom. The point is,
is that we have to find another school.

404
00:25:01,013 --> 00:25:02,613
**********************

405
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,055
Don't tell me what
the point is, Tommy.

406
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,812
Your scholarship is the point
and getting into a good college is the point.

407
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,590
*****************

408
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,518
Girls are beside the point.

409
00:25:11,372 --> 00:25:14,967
Jesus, Tommy,
what are you trying to do to me?

410
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,829
I'm not trying to do anything to you, Mom.
Forget it, okay?

411
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:17,830
*******************

412
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,295
You tell me you're gonna piss away
your scholarship because of girls?

413
00:25:20,396 --> 00:25:21,396
I'm not gonna forget it.

414
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:25,017
What am I working for?
Slaving away for you every day?

415
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,250
- Forget this!
- Tommy! Where you going?

416
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,455
- Out!
- Out where?

417
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,451
Out, out.

418
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,213
Go on.
Run away just like your father.

419
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,411
He didn't run away, Mom.
He died.

420
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,571
A lot of times
when I was pissed off or upset,

421
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,634
I used to go to the House of D.
To count my money.

422
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,473
Why you checkin' out new girls when you can't
even take care of the ones you got, Andrew?

423
00:25:56,474 --> 00:25:57,974
*********************

424
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:00,171
What happened, baby?
Talk to me now.

425
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,514
I think maybe the money was the only thing
that made me feel powerful, gave me hope.

426
00:26:02,515 --> 00:26:04,615
*************************

427
00:26:04,616 --> 00:26:05,616
I could change my life with it.

428
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,690
Hey, kid!
Hey, you...

429
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,856
you with all the money!

430
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,733
What's with all the change?
You rob a bus?

431
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,176
Why don't you run over to Washington Square
Park and scope me a dime bag of weed?

432
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,295
No way!

433
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,973
- Oh, I get it. You a mama's boy.
- No, I'm not!

434
00:26:22,538 --> 00:26:23,874
******************

435
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:28,218
Don't worry. I can't get down there
and steal that little money.

436
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,450
Hey, I hear it's crazy in there.

437
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,729
My mom says you got rats,

438
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,811
roaches, lesbianism...

439
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,175
Well, I guess I'm safe from the last one.
'M in solitary.

440
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,979
Why you buryin' money for anyway?
What are you, nine, eight, ten? What?

441
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,580
*******************

442
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,810
Thirteen... almost.

443
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,335
Thirteen, almost. Girls.

444
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,779
How'd you know?

445
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,659
I'm a genius. That's why I'm up here!
Now tell me...

446
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,617
- Tell you what?
- About the girls.

447
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,259
No way.
I don't even know you.

448
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,298
Well, I ain't going anywhere.
Who am I gonna tell? My pillow?

449
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,736
Come on. You dyin' to tell somebody.
It might as well be me.

450
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,174
You got a crush on some girl.

451
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,534
I don't.

452
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,099
Just tell me.

453
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,857
Her name's Melissa,
and, oh, man,

454
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,976
she's so fine.

455
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,410
But I told some of the guys
that she was flat.

456
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,814
Flat.

457
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,376
How you doin'?
Yeah, you know...

458
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,657
Oh, you were showin' off. That's all right.
Everybody shows off sometime.

459
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,615
Yeah, exactly. But I didn't mean it to be mean
or anything like that.

460
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:32,616
********************

461
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:38,096
And she heard about it, and like all of her
girlfriends came to my school

462
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,832
and started kicking at me and screaming
and saying I had small balls.

463
00:27:39,833 --> 00:27:41,733
**********************

464
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,418
It's not funny.

465
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,810
No, it's not.

466
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,335
It's my uncle we're talking about.
Small, bald man, short, no hair.

467
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,292
I mean, personally,
I like small balls.

468
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:58,258
- You do?
- Yeah!

469
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,411
The other ones just get in the way.

470
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,219
Bangin' around in areas
they have no business in.

471
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,736
So, even if you do have small balls,
good for you!

472
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,573
Hi.
Good for me?

473
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:13,494
Yeah. And those girls don't hate you.
What's your name?

474
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,893
Tommy.

475
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:19,291
Those girls like you, Tommy.
That's why they bitchin' you out.

476
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,893
That doesn't make any sense.

477
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,375
Yes, it does.
Who's your best friend?

478
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,059
Pappass.

479
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,051
What kind of name is that?

480
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:30,775
He's retarded, and Greek
on his father's side, I think.

481
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:34,489
Well, don't you give this Pappass more shit
than anybody in the world?

482
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,969
Yeah. I always
call him "Papp-ass."

483
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,619
That's cause you two
are so tight!

484
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,611
I guess.

485
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,532
And that's how girls
your age are.

486
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,533
If they really like you,
they treat you real bad.

487
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,373
The more it seems they hate you,
the more they really like you.

488
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,135
So I bet you this flat-chested girl...
What's her name?

489
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,659
Melissa.

490
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:59,899
I say this Melissa
likes you most of all.

491
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,130
Now please come on
and give me that weed.

492
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,339
I want to teach you
something about meat.

493
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,570
Let me try.

494
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,653
Oh, that's so cool.

495
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,856
You keep it.
You need to study.

496
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,975
You sure?

497
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,892
For your 13th birthday.

498
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,732
I got more.
Don't worry.

499
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,129
Thanks.
I can make one of these.

500
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,417
Delivery.

501
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,115
Hey, Tommy,
do you ever miss your dad?

502
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,474
All the time.

503
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,892
- You want mine?
- No, thanks, Pappass.

504
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,892
This is the longest delivery
in the history of meat!

505
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,528
Engaging Apollo
retro rockets, Pappass, please!

506
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,656
- Go!
- Going!

507
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,499
Good girl, Daphne.

508
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,377
And the pitch.

509
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,768
Lazy fly ball,
right center field...

510
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,130
down near the bullpen
here at Fenway.

511
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,336
And it's caught
right out there...

512
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,012
Hello.

513
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,579
Delivery!

514
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,016
Wow.

515
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,530
Look at all this
great art.

516
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:17,777
Oh. It's like a museum.

517
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,056
Not that you've ever been
to one.

518
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,814
Look at the grapefruit.
I love grapefruit.

519
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,495
Those aren't grapefruit,
Papp-ass. Those are lemons.

520
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,613
It's a beautiful lemon.
I've never seen one this large.

521
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,089
Oh, there you are.
Sorry. I was on the phone.

522
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,057
Sweetheart, honey,
have you seen my purse?

523
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,598
Sorry.

524
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,852
Oh, great, thank you.

525
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,932
Thanks, sweetie.

526
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:46,896
Hi.

527
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:47,876
Hi.

528
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,415
Pirate's dream.

529
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,218
Shut up.
How you doing?

530
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,938
I'm good, I guess.
How you doing?

531
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:59,299
Um, working.
I deliver meat and stuff.

532
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,890
Yeah, I know.
That's why we ordered from your place.

533
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,537
Really?

534
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,809
Really?

535
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,050
Really?

536
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,699
Wow. What a view.

537
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,578
- I'd really like to paint this sometime.
- Coming through.

538
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,376
- Can I have yours?
- Sure.

539
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,814
Thanks.

540
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,330
Hey, I'm really sorry
about the, uh...

541
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,810
you know, the flat incident.

542
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,698
- Carpenter's dream.
- Pappass.

543
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,932
Don't worry about it.
I am flat.

544
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,579
No shit, Sherlock.

545
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,298
No, you're not at all.

546
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,735
You know,
when you turn sideways,

547
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,131
like, you have
a very, um...

548
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,570
like a very, very nice...
profile.

549
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,856
No tittie at all.
I've seen lemons bigger.

550
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,089
Pappass!

551
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:57,536
It's okay.
I really don't care.

552
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,696
Yeah, well, like,

553
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,611
me, neither.

554
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,539
I have small balls, you know?

555
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,573
But that's good, right?

556
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,497
I don't know.

557
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,288
I have a huge penis.

558
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:25,497
- You gonna go to the dance on Sunday?
- No way, Jose.

559
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,616
- Can I finish your soda?
- Yeah.

560
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,008
- Thanks.
- Have as many as you want.

561
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,454
What dance?

562
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:33,976
Our school's hosting a dance
at your school.

563
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,295
Hey, Tommy, you see she
has a fridge just for sodas.

564
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,177
Are you gonna go
to the dance?

565
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,694
I'm only on
the decorations committee.

566
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,016
What?

567
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,454
Ow!

568
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,451
Sorry. Thought you
had something there.

569
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:52,135
Yeah, he's
the peach fuzz kid.

570
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,932
I shaved my ass once.

571
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,932
Bald as a cue ball.

572
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,616
What is this?

573
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,498
What are you doing?

574
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,451
Mom, I'm in the shower.

575
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,418
- Is that my razor?
- No. Yeah.

576
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,895
- Are you shaving?
- Yeah.

577
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,812
You don't need to shave.

578
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,976
Yeah, I do.

579
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,131
Well, then get
your own damn razor.

580
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,575
I found this
in your pants.

581
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,968
Oh, they're not mine.

582
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,095
Whose are they?

583
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,329
They're a present.

584
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,774
- From who?
- A friend.

585
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,215
What kind of a friend
gives a boy pornography?

586
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,132
I'm not a boy, Mom.

587
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,575
Oh, no. What are you then, a girl?

588
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,616
I'm flushing this filth
down the toilet,

589
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,259
where it belongs.

590
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,974
If you want it,
you can swim after it.

591
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,569
Oh, shit,
the littlest pimp.

592
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,537
Youngblood
taking care of his lady.

593
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,816
Good man.
Good little man.

594
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,733
All right. All right.

595
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,375
I ain't got to worry
about no competition, do I?

596
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,099
- No, sir.
- Good. Catch you later.

597
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,296
Tommy, you got my weed?

598
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,098
No. Sorry.

599
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,699
You don't love me, man.

600
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,414
Hey, there's a dance
this Sunday.

601
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,969
Oh, Melissa, right.
You gonna go?

602
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,732
I don't have any clothes.

603
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,896
Why don't you take some
of that money you ain't spending

604
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,699
on my dime bag and get
you some pimp threads?

605
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,420
I don't dance.

606
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,298
That's too bad.
Girls like boys who dance.

607
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,894
Even if you can't
dance good.

608
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,369
A girl like a guy
who tries.

609
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,976
And girls like guys who play
the fool for 'em.

610
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,290
Solid.
According to you, lady,

611
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,729
girls like fools
and small balls.

612
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,658
So I'm pretty much covered.

613
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,454
I know. Have yourself
a dance strategy.

614
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,929
You wait out
the fast stuff.

615
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,775
All right? And if you can walk,
you can slow dance.

616
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,578
Show me.

617
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,890
No, not out here in public.

618
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,858
I don't see no public.

619
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,257
Come on. There's no music.

620
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,456
Imagine some music.

621
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,611
You see that pole
over there?

622
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,334
That pole?

623
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,491
Yes, that pole.

624
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,895
Look at the pole.
Walk toward the pole.

625
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,213
You want this pole.

626
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,856
No. No.

627
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,772
Don't start your hands
down at the ass.

628
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,373
Work your way down.

629
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,258
Hi, I'm Tommy.

630
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,331
You're very tall.

631
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,576
She just said
she was "pole-ish."

632
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,651
That's cute.

633
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:45,095
Now you put your arms
out around the pole.

634
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,660
Oh, you look like

635
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,935
Frankenstein or something.

636
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,455
You gonna scare the girl.
Loosen up.

637
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,697
There you go.

638
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:04,854
Crossroads seem
to come and go

639
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:10,572
The gypsy flies
from coast to coast

640
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,332
Knowing many

641
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,651
Loving none

642
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:22,288
Bearing sorrows,
having fun

643
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:26,976
But back home
he'll always run

644
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:30,610
To sweet Melissa

645
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,577
Yeah

646
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:36,016
Melissa

647
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:41,578
Yeah! Now I know why
you look so familiar.

648
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,651
I must have seen you
on Soul Train.

649
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:49,411
Again the morning comes

650
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:52,048
Again he's on the run

651
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,899
Sunbeams shining
through his hair

652
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:58,052
He doesn't have a care

653
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:02,770
He picks up the gear
and gypsy roll on

654
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:06,978
Roll on

655
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:11,458
Crossroads

656
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,736
Will you ever let him go?

657
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,416
Here you go, dear.

658
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,616
Thank you.

659
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,853
Holy hands of time, Batman.
I'm late.

660
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,659
Where are you going?
We got a best of seven going on here.

661
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,334
- Simone's.
- On a Sunday evening?

662
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,974
She stays open all the time
when the weather's good.

663
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:32,490
She's got gall. Gaul.

664
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,413
France. Gaul. Get it?

665
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:39,311
- I'm punning bilingually.
- That's a good one, Mom.

666
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,468
You think you got all your smarts from
your old man, but your mama's no dummy.

667
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:43,469
****************

668
00:38:43,931 --> 00:38:45,604
- You gonna be late?
- I think so.

669
00:38:46,156 --> 00:38:47,953
Give us a good-night kiss then.

670
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,014
She cannot be stopped!
She can't!

671
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,893
You cannot stop me.

672
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,613
Sabbath!

673
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,897
Sabbath!

674
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,618
Sabbath!

675
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,930
Sabbath!

676
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,411
Sabbath!

677
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,573
You're gonna regret this.

678
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,135
Come on, Reverend Duncan.

679
00:39:51,915 --> 00:39:54,375
You'd better leave room
for Jesus there, Miss Johnson.

680
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,334
What's up, Pappass?

681
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,012
Hi, Pappass.
Have you seen Tommy?

682
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,011
Tommy don't dance.

683
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,052
Sabbath!

684
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,540
Sabbath!

685
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,775
Oh, I hate this stuff.
It's too slow.

686
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:09,016
I'm outta here.
Southern rock blows.

687
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,051
Where's the funk?

688
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:45,929
How are you?

689
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:50,969
I'm not sure I can talk
and dance at the same time.

690
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,776
Decorations are great.

691
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,293
Thanks.

692
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:59,418
Your outfit is, um,
orange.

693
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:02,737
- Orange.
- Very orange.

694
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,016
And soft.

695
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,094
This bike smells weird.

696
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,053
What do you mean?

697
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,648
It smells like pee.

698
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,851
I don't smell anything.

699
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,137
This is where I work.

700
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,773
Cool.

701
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:20,738
Yeah, my boss would kill me
if she knew I was here.

702
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,571
This is a little public.

703
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:27,538
Come on.
I know a private place.

704
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,415
Yeah.

705
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:51,013
This is private.

706
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,415
But are these
what I think they are?

707
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,650
It's a meat locker.

708
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,731
And this is a dead sheep.

709
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:00,928
That's so gross.

710
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,136
It's okay.
I'll protect you.

711
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:27,131
What are you thinking?

712
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,495
About becoming
a vegetarian.

713
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:35,094
You cold?

714
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:36,579
No.

715
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:02,020
I think it's late.

716
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:04,774
I'll take you home.

717
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,055
I had a decent time.

718
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:33,733
Me, too.

719
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,608
I really liked kissing you.

720
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,416
You lied to me.

721
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:45,138
You lied to me!

722
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,211
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did. You didn't go to work.

723
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:49,814
You went to the dance
dressed like a clown.

724
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,857
- You don't do that!
- I'm sorry.

725
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,295
Don't do that.

726
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:55,734
I'm sorry.

727
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,175
Don't. Please.

728
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,940
- Don't lie to me ever again.
- I won't.

729
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,958
If you make a wish and don't tell nobody,
it could come true.

730
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,959
****************

731
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:15,688
Kissinger, Nixon and Agnew,
and I only got two bullets, right?

732
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,019
Hey, Tommy.

733
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:26,171
Hear about what happened
to Pappass?

734
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,251
No, I was late
this morning.

735
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,570
He got caught stealing a bike,
and he got fired.

736
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:32,930
I hear his dad's gonna send
him away to Willowbrook.

737
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,698
I haven't seen Pappass today.

738
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:50,055
He's probably scared
to come in.

739
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:52,336
What the hell I care
if he steal a bike?

740
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,252
He still has a job here.

741
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,854
You Americans
with your morality.

742
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,771
Pappass is a child.

743
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:00,816
This Puritanism
drives me insane.

744
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:04,976
This is your uptown delivery.

745
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:46,131
Oh, boy.

746
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:55,248
Hey, lady, lady!

747
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:57,650
Lady!

748
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:00,015
Tommy, that you?

749
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:02,250
My little man.
How was the dance?

750
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:04,092
The dance was great.
It's Pappass.

751
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,979
He stole this bike,
and he just keeps disappearing.

752
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:10,331
I went to try and find him,
and he's not coming home.

753
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,697
- What bike did he steal?
- It's this bike that we were saving up for.

754
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:17,899
After the dance, I took Melissa
to the meat locker, so we could be alone.

755
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:20,893
- You left the Papoose.
- Yeah, 'cause he had work to do.

756
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:23,335
I've been trying to catch him,
and he won't go home.

757
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,650
- And he's gonna lose his job.
- It's your fault!

758
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,014
What?

759
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,648
That's your buddy.
He stole that bike for you.

760
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:33,256
He knows you're going
someplace he can't go.

761
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,854
I'm not going anywhere.
Where am I going?

762
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:38,056
Not where you're going,
but what you're becoming.

763
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,859
- What am I becoming?
- Something he can't.

764
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,738
A man.

765
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,652
That's bullshit.

766
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:47,414
I'm not gonna take the blame
for something that Pappass did.

767
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:50,413
No, Tommy, it's not bullshit.
That's love.

768
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:52,491
That's love.

769
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,058
Tommy!

770
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:08,215
Pappass!

771
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:11,053
Nobody can catch us now.

772
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:12,659
Pappass,
why'd you steal it?

773
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:14,356
'Cause I'm a bad man, Tommy.

774
00:50:15,065 --> 00:50:16,175
Did you steal it for me?

775
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,352
- You wish.
- You know what? Let me...

776
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:20,059
- You don't think I know, but I do.
- Calm down.

777
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:21,470
**************

778
00:50:21,471 --> 00:50:24,971
I know what I know,
and I know what I don't know.

779
00:50:24,857 --> 00:50:25,857
I know.

780
00:50:26,358 --> 00:50:27,358
Calm down.

781
00:50:29,342 --> 00:50:31,902
They took away my job,
Tommy.

782
00:50:52,384 --> 00:50:54,534
So you mean to say
it was you

783
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:56,452
and not Mr. Pappass
that stole the bike.

784
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,099
Yes.

785
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:01,138
Well, that's not in character.

786
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,939
That's not the Tom Warshaw I know.

787
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,931
Why did you steal something?

788
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,612
I wanted it.

789
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:13,251
Even though I know
not to covet material things,

790
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:14,739
like Lot's wife.

791
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:18,972
It's a beautiful damn bike,
though.

792
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:20,937
What would you
call that green?

793
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:22,049
Sorry, sir.

794
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:25,974
The green of the bicycle.

795
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:27,254
Al green.

796
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:30,014
Al green.

797
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:34,133
It's a lovely Al green.

798
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:37,969
Oh, yes.

799
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:40,608
Thanks for coming
forward, Tom.

800
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:43,208
You're suspended
for a week.

801
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,496
And of course, your scholarship
will come under review.

802
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,412
You can finish up
your classes today

803
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:49,451
and get the rest
of the assignments for the week

804
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:51,451
so you don't fall behind.

805
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:56,737
Your mother will
be very disappointed.

806
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,016
Yes, sir.

807
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:03,368
Les enfants,

808
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:04,495
this is a popped test.

809
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:06,412
Please focus.

810
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:12,899
Mr. Warshaw, could I have
a moment of your time, please?

811
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:19,413
- You stay right here, Mr. Pappass.
- Yes, sir.

812
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:27,896
We're on the horns
of a dilemma here, Mr. Warshaw.

813
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:31,370
When I met with Mr. Pappass
to reinstate him

814
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:32,768
in his custodial capacity,

815
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:35,090
I told him that you had come
forward about the bicycle theft

816
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:37,820
and were willing to accept
an appropriate punishment.

817
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:41,336
He got very agitated and told me
once again he stole the bike.

818
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,492
Only now he's telling me that
he stole the bicycle for you.

819
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,412
Pappass.

820
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,299
Don't talk to Mr. Pappass.
Talk to me.

821
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:51,291
Who is responsible?

822
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,291
I am. I stole
the bike for Tommy.

823
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:54,529
Shut up, Pappass.

824
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:57,294
I threw a lemon,
huge beautiful lemon.

825
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:02,055
As if he were
in your employ, Tommy.

826
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:05,377
A minion and you a ringleader,
he stole the bike for you?

827
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:09,928
That's right.

828
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,831
I was supposed to be normal, but I didn't get
enough oxygen when I was born.

829
00:53:11,832 --> 00:53:14,332
****************

830
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:16,179
Will you be quiet,
Mr. Pappass?

831
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:18,649
Theft is one thing, Tommy.

832
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,838
A momentary lapse in judgment,
covetousness, ultimately forgivable.

833
00:53:20,839 --> 00:53:22,939
****************

834
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:25,290
There's no oxygen
right now, either.

835
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,697
But this psychological usury,
this web of deceit,

836
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:31,533
this Machiavellian domination
of a weak-minded,

837
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:36,330
pitiful man goes beyond
one isolated act

838
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,657
and speaks to a fundamental
and frankly disturbing deficit in character.

839
00:53:38,658 --> 00:53:40,858
******************

840
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:44,137
Do you have anything to say
for yourself, Mr. Warshaw?

841
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,820
Pappass stole the bike
for me.

842
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:52,175
I'm profoundly disappointed
in you.

843
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:55,457
Profoundly.
You go home right now.

844
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:57,491
The school will contact
your mother

845
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:59,457
with further disciplinary
action.

846
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:28,255
Oh, man, you took three already.

847
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:33,534
Three. 18 take away 15 equals 3.

848
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:37,255
I took some sedative.

849
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:41,618
And I want to go to "bedative."

850
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,133
Mom.

851
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,458
Oh, Tommy, Tommy,

852
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:50,498
they want to take away
your scholarship.

853
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:52,412
You're gonna end up in the gutter.
You know that?

854
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,059
They want to expel you.

855
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:55,938
I'm not gonna wind up
in the gutter, Mom.

856
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,455
Without an education,
you're gonna end up in the gutter.

857
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:00,696
- I'm not gonna end up in the gutter.
- Yes, you are!

858
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:03,573
- Don't worry. No, no.
- You know why you're not?

859
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:05,014
Because we're gonna fight 'em,

860
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:06,438
- and we're gonna beat 'em.
- Exactly.

861
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:09,739
- They're not even fit to lick our boots.
- We'll fight 'em.

862
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:11,840
And we'll win, Tom-ass.

863
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:15,417
- Mom?
- What? That's what Pappass calls you, right?

864
00:55:15,418 --> 00:55:17,518
*****************

865
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,920
Sometimes, Mom-ass.

866
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:22,216
Very clever.

867
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:24,496
Go on now.

868
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:27,254
Quit hovering over me
like a mother hen.

869
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:33,213
You're gonna...
You're gonna smother me.

870
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:14,249
Mom!

871
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:17,732
Mom, wake up.

872
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:19,811
Mom, wake up!

873
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:29,855
Operator, my mom!
It's my mom!

874
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:57,575
Hey, Mom,
what day is it today?

875
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,891
I thought so.

876
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:11,218
Mom, look.
It's the 20th.

877
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:13,570
It's the 20th. Mom.

878
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:15,856
I'm 13 today.

879
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:32,291
What is it? Tommy?

880
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:36,373
Yes, ma'am, there's a Tommy here
who wants to see Melissa.

881
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,060
I understand. Yeah.

882
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:41,751
No, I understand completely
Mrs. Logan, really. Okay.

883
00:57:42,283 --> 00:57:44,116
Sorry, kid, you can't go up.

884
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,256
- Why not?
- I don't know.

885
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:48,610
Can you ask
if Melissa can come down?

886
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:51,055
No, I can't do that, kid.
Come on, take off.

887
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:52,255
Why not?

888
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:54,769
Now, hey, I'm sorry. Listen.

889
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:56,373
Life is long, you know?
Live it up.

890
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:57,973
How old are you anyway?
Maybe 15?

891
00:57:58,140 --> 00:57:59,289
13.

892
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:00,654
13?

893
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:02,736
Ah, you'll forget her in a week.
Take off.

894
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:13,974
Who the hell are you?

895
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:15,288
Tommy, hi.

896
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:19,334
You don't remember me?

897
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,695
I'm Monty Bean.

898
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:24,010
And this is my wife,
Sandra Head-Bean.

899
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:27,337
Hi, Tommy.

900
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:29,012
I'm your mom's
second cousin.

901
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:32,252
Now, we've come down from
Toronto to take care of you...

902
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:34,536
till things settle down.

903
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,418
And we so love New York.

904
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:39,697
What does "settle down" mean?

905
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:41,259
Arrangements
have to be made,

906
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:43,650
e.g., the subject
of the guardian.

907
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:45,532
You're a minor.

908
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:49,895
Your mom's
not comin' back.

909
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:52,330
I thought you had this conversation
with the doctor.

910
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:53,296
I did.

911
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:56,253
- You didn't understand, then.
- I understood.

912
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:58,169
She took too many sedatives by mistake,
so she has brain death.

913
00:59:58,170 --> 00:59:59,970
*******************

914
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:03,177
She is, "persistently vegetative."

915
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:05,171
And I'll take care of my mom,

916
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:08,610
not you, or you... me.

917
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:13,372
Well,

918
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:15,496
regardless,

919
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:19,050
we, Sandra and me,

920
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:20,295
will be looking after you

921
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,252
until it's decided
where you can be.

922
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:24,615
Have you given a thought
to military school?

923
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:05,858
Goddamn it, Pappass.

924
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:08,090
Lady!

925
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:11,536
Tommy!
Got my dime bag?

926
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:12,815
What's your name?

927
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:15,369
I like you calling me "Lady."

928
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,934
I want to know your real name.

929
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:19,613
Why?

930
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:22,214
Because I want to know who
to blame for ruining my life!

931
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:24,980
I want to know
your real name!

932
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:26,454
Well, what happened?

933
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,474
Nothing. I just did what you said
and the shit hit the fan.

934
01:01:28,475 --> 01:01:29,659
**************

935
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,213
I got expelled,
Melissa won't see me

936
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:35,974
and my mom... my mom O.D.'d
because of me!

937
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,248
Your mom what, Tommy?

938
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:41,139
She took pills
because I got expelled.

939
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:44,772
She's in a coma.

940
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:47,374
- Well, what about your daddy?
- My dad's dead!

941
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:48,575
And there's this stupid...

942
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:55,257
Those military people
in my house!

943
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:01,329
And I don't know what to do.

944
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:03,451
They're...

945
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:08,057
Lady, there are people
I don't know at my house!

946
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,094
Man!

947
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:22,170
Man, life is hard.

948
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:26,851
But you a lucky man!

949
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:28,778
Be free!

950
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:30,498
What?

951
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:34,010
- Run!
- Where?

952
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:35,414
Where am I gonna go?

953
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:37,013
Anywhere!

954
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:38,818
You a man!

955
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:40,652
You free! Go!

956
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:43,459
I want to wait for you.

957
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:47,818
Lady, I want to see you.

958
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:58,372
I want to see you!

959
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:01,219
Boy, you will never see me!

960
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:03,177
Why?

961
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:05,410
- You know why I'm in here, boy?
- No.

962
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:07,059
I murdered my husband

963
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:09,575
in his sleep
with my bare hands.

964
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:13,210
I'm a murderer!

965
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:14,654
I hate men!

966
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:17,413
And if they let me out
this bitch, I'll kill again!

967
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:20,378
I mean, if you get in my way,
I might even kill you!

968
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:23,339
I don't care.

969
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:28,052
Look, I'm not playing with you
no more, Tommy.

970
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:29,369
Run!

971
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:31,059
Get out of here!
Get away from me!

972
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:34,018
And stop looking up at me like that!
I ain't your lady!

973
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:37,417
I ain't your mama!
I can't help you!

974
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:39,093
I ain't got nothin' for you!

975
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:41,535
- You wanna know my name, little boy?
- Yeah!

976
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:47,256
My name is
Bernadette Odelia Glasser!

977
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:51,174
And I never want
to see you again, Tommy!

978
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:55,612
Get away from me. Run!

979
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:31,210
What's that?
Who's there?

980
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:34,694
Jack, is that you?

981
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:39,894
Oh, Jack, my son.

982
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:41,419
My beautiful boy.

983
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:44,976
Why have you
stayed away so long?

984
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:47,534
I, uh...

985
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:49,053
I was in trouble.

986
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:50,289
Trouble?

987
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:51,575
I'm in trouble.

988
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:54,294
Must you go away again, Jack?

989
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:56,052
Yeah.

990
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:58,893
It's not because
you don't love me, is it?

991
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:02,097
I was so afraid
you didn't love me.

992
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:03,579
No.

993
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:06,817
You love your mama?

994
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:09,853
Yeah, I love my mama.

995
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:12,935
Is that my money?

996
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:15,972
Oh, good.

997
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:20,054
Take the money.

998
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:28,652
Good boy.
Take the money.

999
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:35,258
Thank you, Miss...

1000
01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:37,058
Mama.

1001
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:53,455
She's not breathing.
Get the doctor.

1002
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:37,489
Okay, you've gotta give me
the dad-face one last time,

1003
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:39,218
okay, Pappass?

1004
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:40,415
Okay.

1005
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:42,298
Otherwise, keep
your mouth shut, okay?

1006
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:44,178
Okay.

1007
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:48,016
How many sleeps
will you be away?

1008
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:51,850
How many sleeps
till you come back here?

1009
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:55,492
Not too long, Pappass.

1010
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:01,777
Hey, who wrote
French Rupture?

1011
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:04,374
I don't know.

1012
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:07,692
- All right.
- To Paris.

1013
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:18,818
You're quite young to be paying
for your own plane ticket, aren't you?

1014
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:21,534
Oh, this is my dad.

1015
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:27,935
You know, actually,
Dad has laryngitis

1016
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:29,738
and he shouldn't
be talking at all.

1017
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:31,458
It's not good
for his throat.

1018
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:35,613
I'm sorry, sir.

1019
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:37,691
I'm gonna need to see
some identification.

1020
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:42,219
Some identification?

1021
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:45,178
Dad, show him your I.D.
Dad!

1022
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:48,975
You know, your I.D., Dad?

1023
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:52,210
I can't talk.

1024
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:53,369
Right.

1025
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:59,329
Look, I'm just gonna
make a phone call.

1026
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:02,060
What the Sam Hill is going on here?

1027
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:03,814
- Sir?
- I'm not gonna be late to work because of you!

1028
01:09:04,735 --> 01:09:07,135
***********************

1029
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:10,213
I'm sorry, sir,
I'm just doing my job.

1030
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:11,449
Me, too.

1031
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:13,835
See this uniform?

1032
01:09:14,383 --> 01:09:16,338
St. Andrews School for boys.

1033
01:09:16,345 --> 01:09:17,494
Assistantjanitor.

1034
01:09:18,883 --> 01:09:21,192
I don't think you're
gonna be very happy

1035
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:22,800
if I have to call the Reverend Duncan
down here to talk to you.

1036
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:23,694
Who?

1037
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:25,492
Reverend Duncan.

1038
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:29,579
Look, um, I'm a Christian, too.

1039
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:31,599
Good! Now, give the kid his ticket!

1040
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:37,259
Okay, all right.
Just, um...

1041
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,217
Just give me a minute.

1042
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:40,256
You retard!

1043
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:08,932
I don't want you to take
any shit off your dad, okay?

1044
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:11,574
- Okay.
- And, um, listen.

1045
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:14,413
Stop drinking so much soda
'cause you're gonna get fat.

1046
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:16,736
Yeah.

1047
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:18,492
And...

1048
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:23,336
if you have a problem at school,
you can talk to Duncan.

1049
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:25,934
'Cause he's not
a total jackass.

1050
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:27,653
And listen, if Simone...

1051
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:29,776
Do good things, Tommy.

1052
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:40,179
Promise me...

1053
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:42,649
you do good things.

1054
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:45,209
I promise.

1055
01:10:58,740 --> 01:10:59,809
Thomas.

1056
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:43,377
I told my wife everything that night.

1057
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:44,734
How, when I came to Paris,

1058
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:47,619
I slept on the streets
for a while until I got a job

1059
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:50,453
drawing for the fashion magazines
and could support myself...

1060
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:52,531
that I pretty much erased my past

1061
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:53,450
and kept to myself

1062
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:56,339
until I met her

1063
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:59,059
and wanted to start
my own family.

1064
01:12:03,862 --> 01:12:05,362
**************

1065
01:12:06,395 --> 01:12:07,695
********************

1066
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:10,698
I was in the habit of never telling anybody
anything about my past.

1067
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:12,577
But when I was
falling in love with you,

1068
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:14,219
every morning
I'd wake up and think,

1069
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:15,108
"Today's the day
I'm gonna tell her,"

1070
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,099
and every morning
I'd say nothing.

1071
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:19,609
Eventually, just too much
time passed and l...

1072
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:22,374
I felt that if I told you now,

1073
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:24,534
you'd get
scared and disgusted

1074
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:26,995
that I could lie so well,
so long, and you'd leave me.

1075
01:12:28,021 --> 01:12:31,172
And you didn't tell me
and I did leave you anyway.

1076
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:35,214
Well, that's what we in America
like to call irony.

1077
01:12:36,464 --> 01:12:38,464
***************

1078
01:12:38,988 --> 01:12:39,988
***************

1079
01:12:40,739 --> 01:12:41,739
***************

1080
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:44,325
***************

1081
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:49,735
I talked all night,

1082
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:51,936
probably more than
I'd talked to her in a year.

1083
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:53,852
And when the sun came up,

1084
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:55,135
it was my turn to listen.

1085
01:12:55,300 --> 01:13:00,215
I always knew you have
an emptiness in your heart.

1086
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:03,218
And I was a little afraid for Odell and me
that maybe you're cold.

1087
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:06,053
Well, that's why
I'm telling you this.

1088
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:07,773
So you know me.

1089
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:09,811
These are just words.

1090
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,778
You need to start over.

1091
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:16,131
To New York, you go.

1092
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:20,532
I can'tjust start over.

1093
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:23,089
And yet you want us
to start over?

1094
01:13:25,820 --> 01:13:28,493
You need to go back, Tom.
To move ahead.

1095
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:32,856
I'm scared to go back
to New York.

1096
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:39,172
A man is a man only when he can be himself
wherever he is.

1097
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:43,291
I want this man.

1098
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:47,419
Odell needs this man.

1099
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:51,175
Otherwise, this is just
a bedtime story.

1100
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:02,612
I'm not gonna recognize her

1101
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:04,338
from any of these mug shots,

1102
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,570
'cause I never really got
a good look at her face.

1103
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:09,618
I know she was black.
At least her hand was black.

1104
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:12,453
I do know she was in prison
for murdering her husband.

1105
01:15:12,620 --> 01:15:14,497
No, no, that's not possible.

1106
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:16,850
How do you mean?

1107
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:18,771
Well, the women's
house of detention

1108
01:15:18,940 --> 01:15:20,339
was not maximum security.

1109
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,968
A murderer would
never have been held there.

1110
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:24,459
She told me
she murdered her husband.

1111
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:26,451
Why would she lie?

1112
01:15:30,980 --> 01:15:32,208
To make me run.

1113
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:35,618
To make me run away.

1114
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:06,212
Bernadette?

1115
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:10,410
Bernadette Odelia,
my name is Tom Warshaw.

1116
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:12,411
Can I come in?

1117
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:16,617
It's Tommy, Bernadette.
I think we may have spoken

1118
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:18,259
many years ago
when I was a kid

1119
01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:20,928
and you were in
the women's house of detention.

1120
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:22,619
Maybe you don't remember.

1121
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:29,374
I just wanted you to know
that I'm alive and l...

1122
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:33,620
I made it to Paris.
I have a wife and a son.

1123
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:41,212
My son's name is Odell.

1124
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:45,972
Odell for Odelia.

1125
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:08,298
I'm gonna leave a little
present out here for ya.

1126
01:17:09,940 --> 01:17:11,896
Sorry, it's still
not your dime bag.

1127
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:16,649
Tommy!

1128
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:20,859
Lady!

1129
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:27,499
You have a beautiful face.

1130
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:34,171
Tommy, we did
what we had to do,

1131
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:36,410
didn't we?

1132
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:39,133
It's all right.

1133
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:41,057
She understands.

1134
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:44,849
Your poor mama.

1135
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:48,899
She understands a boy have
to go away before he come back.

1136
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:57,055
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1137
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:07,774
Run, Tommy.

1138
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:12,058
I don't have to run anymore.
Lady, I can walk now.

1139
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:15,132
I know you can walk.

1140
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:17,177
And I know
you can dance.

1141
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:19,251
But I'm saying,

1142
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:22,810
this is a bad neighborhood
for a Ione white boy.

1143
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:24,095
Now, run.

1144
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:28,609
Run! Run!

1145
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:33,416
Run, Tommy!

1146
01:20:02,780 --> 01:20:04,259
Hey.

1147
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:29,412
Sweet wheels.

1148
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:30,853
Check it out.

1149
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:36,977
- You live in the neighborhood?
- Yeah. Born and raised.

1150
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:38,533
Maybe you can help me then.

1151
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:39,934
I've been trying
to figure something out.

1152
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:43,092
I've forgotten who wrote this
famous book I once read.

1153
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:45,057
Uh, French Rupture.

1154
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:49,139
Remember who wrote that?

1155
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:51,251
Is that Ivanna Kutcharakov?

1156
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:55,299
No. Ivanna Kutcharakov
wrote Russian Rupture.

1157
01:20:55,460 --> 01:20:57,610
Obviously, I. Kutchyarokov's
a Russian name.

1158
01:20:57,780 --> 01:20:59,259
Oh, all right.

1159
01:20:59,420 --> 01:21:02,651
French Rupture was
written by Jacques Tootight.

1160
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:04,094
Oh, that's a French name.

1161
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:05,653
- Obviously.
- That makes sense.

1162
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:08,857
Sweet ride.
That's beautiful.

1163
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:11,295
What about Chinese Rupture,
you remember who wrote that?

1164
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,297
One Hung Lo.

1165
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:15,894
- That's a Chinese name.
- Yeah.

1166
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:17,573
- Makes sense.
- Yeah.

1167
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:20,174
What about Open Kimono?
You remember that?

1168
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:23,173
Open Kimono?
Who wrote that?

1169
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:25,057
Do I look like
a library to you?

1170
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:29,899
No, I was just...

1171
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:31,493
Get out of here.

1172
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:32,854
I was just trying to...

1173
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:34,373
Come on, buddy.
Get a life.

1174
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:44,651
Tommy!

1175
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:46,139
Psyche.

1176
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:29,654
I saved your Bible.

1177
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:37,974
All the little floating balls,
I saved them.

1178
01:22:38,140 --> 01:22:40,131
I call it your
baseball bible.

1179
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:41,892
I saved it for you.

1180
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:48,734
You drew that.

1181
01:22:52,580 --> 01:22:54,696
- You forgive me, Pappass?
- Yeah.

1182
01:22:54,860 --> 01:22:56,179
For what?

1183
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:01,893
- Look at you, Tom-ass.
- What?

1184
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:02,935
Look at you.

1185
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:04,499
Look at me what, Papp-ass?

1186
01:23:04,660 --> 01:23:06,730
You have
the dad-face now.

1187
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:23,010
My dad died...
a lot of sleeps ago.

1188
01:23:23,180 --> 01:23:24,932
Cancer ate him,
just like your dad.

1189
01:23:25,020 --> 01:23:27,454
Cancer is the crab
on the horoscope.

1190
01:23:27,620 --> 01:23:29,736
Crab dinner, $6.95,
all you can eat.

1191
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:31,333
Sorry, Pappass.

1192
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:34,333
It's okay, 'cause the crab
ate all the hard parts first,

1193
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:35,853
the mean parts.

1194
01:23:36,020 --> 01:23:38,580
The parts that hate me
being retarded.

1195
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:41,373
Just before he died
when he was only mostly dead,

1196
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:43,092
he was so nice.

1197
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:47,936
'Cause only the soft parts
were left.

1198
01:23:48,020 --> 01:23:49,851
He was the nicest guy
in the world.

1199
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:51,857
He hugged me,
and he told me over and over,

1200
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:54,739
he loved me, he loved me, he loved me.

1201
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:57,771
Pappass.

1202
01:23:57,940 --> 01:23:59,453
I hate seafood.

1203
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:04,538
You know, Tommy,
sometimes I think the crab ate me

1204
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:06,691
while I was still
in my mom's belly.

1205
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:09,215
I think it ate
all my smart parts.

1206
01:24:09,380 --> 01:24:11,132
Do you think that's
what happened, Tommy?

1207
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:12,858
- No.
- No?

1208
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:16,931
I think you got
plenty of smart parts, Pappass.

1209
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:19,290
Yeah.

1210
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:26,856
Chinese takeout, ESPN,
some nice cold orange soda.

1211
01:24:28,260 --> 01:24:30,615
I could get used
to a koosh joint like this.

1212
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:34,658
That's more numbers
than I've ever dialed.

1213
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:37,254
Who are you calling, a girl?

1214
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:39,972
Tommy's got a girlfriend!

1215
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:43,330
Not a girl, Pappass,
it's a lady.

1216
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:44,728
A lady.

1217
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:47,368
Ooh, a lady

1218
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:50,409
Lady!

1219
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:55,575
Loser.

1220
01:24:57,540 --> 01:24:59,098
A lady.

1221
01:25:01,180 --> 01:25:04,855
Hey. This is your
American phone pal.

1222
01:25:17,604 --> 01:25:18,604
***************

1223
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:29,053
Hey, Dad!

1224
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:30,613
Hello?

1225
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:35,369
Remember me?

1226
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:37,018
- Hold on, partner.
- Hey!

1227
01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:41,298
Hey!

1228
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:43,655
Where's Odell?
Why didn't you bring him?

1229
01:25:43,820 --> 01:25:45,299
I much like the service
at this hotel.

1230
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:46,893
- Over here!
- There's Odell!

1231
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:49,775
Very funny, Dad.

1232
01:26:06,020 --> 01:26:07,976
Pappass! Slow down.
I got a passenger!

1233
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:09,459
Where are you taking us?

1234
01:26:09,620 --> 01:26:12,817
That's for me to know
and you to find out!

1235
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:19,773
Almost there!

1236
01:26:25,420 --> 01:26:26,614
Okay.

1237
01:26:32,180 --> 01:26:34,569
Well, Pappass, where are we?
If that's, uh...

1238
01:26:34,780 --> 01:26:36,816
That's Jefferson Market, there.
Then...

1239
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:40,012
Women's House of D.

1240
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:45,130
What is it, Daddy?

1241
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:47,768
There used to be
a prison here, Odell.

1242
01:26:47,940 --> 01:26:51,615
Yes. There used to be
a courthouse and a prison.

1243
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:53,372
And now, there's a library

1244
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:55,929
and a beautiful garden.

1245
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:57,852
Places change
like people change,

1246
01:26:58,020 --> 01:26:58,930
you know, like...

1247
01:26:59,140 --> 01:27:01,051
when you start to grow hair,
Odell, down...

1248
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:02,978
you know what
I'm talking about, right?

1249
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:04,698
Yeah, for example,

1250
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:07,215
I'm not retarded anymore.

1251
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:08,335
- Oh, really?
- Really.

1252
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:09,455
When did that happen?

1253
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:11,531
Oh, 1984.

1254
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:13,452
Sometime in the spring.

1255
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:16,737
I went from retard,
to mentally handicapped.

1256
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:19,698
And then, in 1987, '88,

1257
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:23,250
I went from handicapped
to challenged.

1258
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:24,455
I changed again.

1259
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:26,576
I'm probably changing
right now, you know?

1260
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:28,537
Who knows what I'll be next?

1261
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:31,168
See? There's hope
for you, Dad.

1262
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:33,257
Oh? There's hope for me?

1263
01:27:33,460 --> 01:27:35,690
Your dad loved change
more than anyone.

1264
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:37,299
We had a bike riding job
together,

1265
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:39,331
and we saved up
all that change.

1266
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:41,934
And I took the change,
and I threw it in the river.

1267
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:43,937
And I made a wish
that there was no change,

1268
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:48,059
but the change made
everything change.

1269
01:27:48,220 --> 01:27:50,495
And this is the place
where we buried our change.

1270
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:02,653
"Boner."

1271
01:28:04,340 --> 01:28:07,059
Two days in America
and your accent is horrible.

1272
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:10,496
Not "boner." Bonheur.

1273
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:11,854
Bone-er.

1274
01:28:11,980 --> 01:28:13,413
- Bonheur.
- Boner.

1275
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:14,933
Bonheurl

1276
01:28:15,100 --> 01:28:17,170
- Boner.
- Boner, yeah.

1277
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:18,489
Yeah, boner.

1278
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:20,019
You talk funny.
Where are you from?

1279
01:28:20,180 --> 01:28:21,499
They're from Paris.

1280
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:32,969
Happy birthday, Odell.

1281
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:38,168
So, this is how you and Pappass
used to ride around?

1282
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:39,893
Uh, sort of.

1283
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:42,335
Not exactly.

1284
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:45,378
Not at all.
I was the one doing all the pedaling.
