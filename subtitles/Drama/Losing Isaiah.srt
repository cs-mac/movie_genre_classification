1
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:46,287
You ain't leaving
that baby here...

2
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,157
not hollering like
that, you ain't.

3
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,000
Yo, girl! Hey, baby!

4
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,096
Come on over here
and get warm.

5
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,404
Come on, now.

6
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:12,315
We gonna trade you
some good shit!

7
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,378
Come on, you can have
a little bit of this.

8
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,389
Come on, now.

9
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:21,587
You know, we know
what you need.

10
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,118
Come on, baby.

11
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,562
Okay, Isaiah.

12
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,590
There you go, okay? Shh.

13
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,227
I'll be right back, okay?

14
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,170
That's right.

15
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,502
Okay, okay.

16
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:38,108
Okay, there you go.

17
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:45,446
Okay.

18
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,675
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

19
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:49,979
I'm telling you, man,
the Bulls are going to repeat.

20
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:52,984
Yeah, yeah, you said the same
thing after the '85 Bears.

21
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:53,984
Ain't gonna happen.

22
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:55,645
The Knicks have got Pat Riley,

23
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,918
and he's going to make
Patrick Ewing play some ball.

24
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:59,083
Hey, you got

25
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,423
B.J. coming off
the bench, shooting a three.

26
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:04,294
I'm thinking about coming out of
retirement and playing myself.

27
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,422
Yeah, I heard that.

28
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,632
I know one thing...

29
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:09,635
I can stop Ewing.

30
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,432
I just have to deal
with Oakley's muscle

31
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:12,438
underneath the board.

32
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,337
I-I used to play
some great defense.

33
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,932
They used to call me "The Wall."

34
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:18,533
Yeah... wall-eyed Wally.

35
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,637
Yeah, Oakley under the boards,
my butt.

36
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,705
M.J. and Scottie'll
take care of the Knicks.

37
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,307
Pippen's bad.

38
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,114
The Knicks are playing
some mean D.

39
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,417
Hey, did you see what Jordan did
to that defense last night?

40
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,683
That's what
I'm talking about!

41
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,190
- Swoosh!
- I wouldn't trade defense...

42
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,523
Hey, hey, you got B.J.
Coming off...

43
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,788
Holy shit!

44
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,295
Stop the blade!

45
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,798
Stop the blade! Stop it!

46
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,839
What's he been given?

47
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,310
Two cc's epinephrine, I.M.

48
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:53,972
- Let's get him to the warmer.
- It's over there!

49
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:57,676
Let's roll! Get out of the way...
baby coming!

50
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,207
All right.

51
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,221
Okay, let's get
some new vitals on him.

52
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,483
What do we got here?

53
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,218
I need a half-normal saline

54
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,488
with glucose drip,
and get me a respirator.

55
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:08,824
- Hold it, hold it.
- Wait.

56
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:09,828
Where's the IV?

57
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:10,829
- No IV established?
- No.

58
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,763
- Why not?
- Not ready to get a line in.

59
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:13,766
Okay, 24-gauge ampule.

60
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,767
I'll do it myself.

61
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:15,893
Go ahead, hold that, yeah.

62
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,664
Let me have a blood gas.

63
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:19,864
He's a subdermal hematoma,
Mrs. Lanelli.

64
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,032
He's five months old.

65
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:23,200
You didn't think he might
roll off that top bunk?

66
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:24,470
He never did it before.

67
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,535
Well, now you know
it's possible.

68
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,604
He's not Peter Pan.
He can't fly.

69
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,479
We need you.

70
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,040
You're going to have
to wait here

71
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:33,608
until the x rays get back.

72
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,247
At least she didn't dump him
in a pot of boiling water, huh?

73
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,224
Yeah, she did that last month...
said his bath was too hot.

74
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:40,316
What have we got?

75
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,793
This one was found
in a dumpster.

76
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,457
Jesus.

77
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:48,631
- Social Services?
- Mm-hmm?

78
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,295
He's not breathing on his own.

79
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,428
Can you sign off?

80
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,438
Sign off?

81
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,303
Yeah. No extraordinary measures.

82
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,399
Why don't we just dump him back
in the garbage?

83
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:57,431
All right, lady...

84
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,274
play God.

85
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,045
Anyone got the paperwork
on Mr. Romano?

86
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,615
It's tachycardia.

87
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,779
BP's down.

88
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,152
Respiratory's erratic.

89
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,723
- BP up.
- It looks like a brain bleed.

90
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:13,725
Keep the oxygen up.

91
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,250
This infant's having a seizure.

92
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:18,126
Uh, doctor!

93
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,495
Phenobarbital, stat.

94
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,466
Let's get him up to NICU.

95
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,832
What'd I tell you?

96
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,461
Hold the elevator!

97
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,172
Damn it,
hold that elevator!

98
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,301
Oh, my God!

99
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:07,312
Oh, my God, my baby! My baby!

100
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:09,041
- Shut up, ho!
- Where's my baby!

101
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:10,912
Had enough racket around here!

102
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,485
Police! Dead babies!

103
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,384
Get out of here!

104
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:18,652
I said get out my alley!

105
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,258
Get!

106
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,593
My baby...

107
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,272
I know all the tubes and wires
are frightening,

108
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,278
but you can hold him.

109
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,870
Okay.

110
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,312
Ain't this
a cute baby?

111
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:43,508
Oh, there you go.

112
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,517
- Excuse me, Margaret.
- Shh. What?

113
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,314
That baby you asked about
last round?

114
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,082
- Yeah?
- He's in NICU.

115
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,952
- Oh. Excuse me.
- Thank you.

116
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,888
Just talk to him.
He'll be all right.

117
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,586
His prints
were on the computer.

118
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,595
He was born at Cook County
three days ago.

119
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,324
Mother and baby
both crack-addicted.

120
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:01,128
He's over there:
Isaiah Richards.

121
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,600
Huh.

122
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,762
Nurse Forgen to East Wing Two.

123
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,337
Isaiah.

124
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:24,684
"And he shall be called
wonderful."

125
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:31,586
Dr. Parks, 6214.

126
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,122
Dr. Parks, 6214.

127
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,063
- Look at her.
- Yeah.

128
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:12,297
- Just asking for it.
- Yeah.

129
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,932
Arrest her. The little thief.

130
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,642
Where's the party?

131
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,178
Hey...

132
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:31,985
Come on.

133
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,322
Pay the nice man.

134
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,328
Get off me.

135
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,922
One, two, three.
Crazy. Beautiful. Maybe.

136
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,025
Come on...

137
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:51,841
Oh, look what we got here.

138
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,943
Now, see what you
made me do?

139
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:59,678
You have to use every dish in
the house, Charick Lewin-sky?

140
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,415
Ja, I do, but I'll clean up.

141
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,946
I know you will.

142
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,457
Is she home?

143
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:07,720
Yeah, she's in her room,

144
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,091
on the phone, door closed,

145
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,392
waiting for you to tell her
she has a French quiz

146
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,660
and a history paper
due tomorrow.

147
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,064
You have a French quiz

148
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,126
and a history paper
due tomorrow.

149
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,568
Just a minute.

150
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:20,128
I'm on the phone.

151
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,639
That's easy to fix.
Get off it.

152
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,335
Will you please get
out of my room

153
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,637
so I can study?

154
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,645
Oh, I think you might
want to phrase that

155
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,976
a little differently, honey.

156
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,676
Can I call you back?
My mother's being a jerk.

157
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:34,845
Mom, sit down,
make yourself comfortable.

158
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,320
Thank you.

159
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:41,349
This is gone if you don't
do well on the exam tomorrow.

160
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,691
...and hairline fractures

161
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,492
of the clavicle and cranium.

162
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:46,998
Burns and old scarring.

163
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:48,090
Maggie, what are you,

164
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,102
a social worker
or a war correspondent?

165
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,899
War correspondent.

166
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,564
Recommend foster care to avoid

167
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,198
further trauma to this child.

168
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,004
The old scar tissue
indicates...

169
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:58,703
Uh, would you say
"multiple lacerations

170
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,609
to the upper torso"
one more time, please?

171
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,273
No.

172
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,373
Patient continues
to have trauma...

173
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,940
"Hairline fracture."

174
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,476
- No. No.
- Hmm?

175
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:12,150
"Burns and old scarring"?

176
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,421
No.

177
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,087
We continue to explore...

178
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:19,291
Charlie... would you
scratch my back?

179
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,889
No.

180
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:26,337
Next case, B-14-20.
Child shows signs

181
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,932
of forced responsiveness
to his environment...

182
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:38,082
Yeah?

183
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,948
Cranial contusion.

184
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:44,581
How did you get this number?

185
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:47,649
I could meet you somewhere...
anywhere.

186
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:49,422
Show you the x rays.

187
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:53,090
Uh, oh, d-don't you have
a st-staff meeting tonight?

188
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,100
It's canceled.

189
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:58,934
Uh, Margaret, I can't, um...

190
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:02,134
I got a whole pile
of screwed-up wirings

191
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,335
got to be worked out
by tomorrow.

192
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:05,934
Oh, well.

193
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:11,210
There's a surgeon here
who's just dying to show me

194
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,718
some new suture-tying
techniques.

195
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:40,937
Let's go!

196
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,709
Take all your belongings!

197
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:44,579
Let's go!

198
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,551
Come on, come on!

199
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,109
Get off me!

200
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:49,120
Move it, move it!

201
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:50,121
Get out the way!

202
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:51,087
Move!

203
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,986
Get off me!

204
00:14:57,096 --> 00:15:00,088
Move it! Move it!

205
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,559
Your names are on your beds.

206
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:06,901
You'll be expected to keep
your area clean at all times.

207
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,304
Now, there are those of you

208
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,433
who elected this program
to cut your time.

209
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,205
Well, if that's why you're here,

210
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,838
you better turn around
and get back on that bus,

211
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,438
because you won't last a day.

212
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:19,747
This is work... hard work.

213
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:22,049
One mistake... one...

214
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,420
and you're out on your
base-head, pill-popping,

215
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:28,722
alcoholic asses,
back in the general population

216
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,093
quicker than you can
blink your eyes.

217
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,257
Understand?

218
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,900
I don't know.
What do you want me to say, hmm?

219
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,370
I mean,
I've only been recommending

220
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:40,872
permanent foster care
for that child

221
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:42,840
for four years now.

222
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,570
No, no, go ahead...

223
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,771
send her back if that's
what the courts want.

224
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:49,178
But listen, you tell that
son-of-a-bitch judge...

225
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:51,615
that if her father
finally kills her,

226
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,118
not to come weeping to me.

227
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:14,402
<i>... nothing says</i>
<i>I would wish it to be.</i>

228
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:18,407
That's my grandma's song.

229
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,610
Yeah, she would've liked you.

230
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:27,051
You're a little fighter,
aren't you, huh?

231
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:30,816
Beans, beets, rice.

232
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:31,948
Hey, Ethel.

233
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,959
- There you go.
- Oh, let's see.

234
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,154
Give me just some rice
and veggies.

235
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:37,560
- Rice and veggies.
- Thanks.

236
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:40,156
You've been a social worker
for what, 15 years?

237
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,666
Mm-hmm.

238
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,726
Let's say a nice,
well-meaning white lady

239
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,261
came into your office
and told you

240
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:50,434
she was thinking of taking
a black crack baby home,

241
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:53,570
thinking she could save it.

242
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,375
What would you say?

243
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,983
Not to.

244
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,248
It's insane, Margaret.

245
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:02,914
A black crack baby...
it's insane.

246
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,479
There's nothing wrong with him.

247
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,492
Well, he could have problems
that won't show up for years.

248
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,926
So could we.

249
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:12,396
Look, Charlie,
you haven't seen him.

250
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:15,525
I mean, there's something
so great about him.

251
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,058
He has... he has this spirit.

252
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:18,933
You can see it in his eyes.

253
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,801
And he has nothing.

254
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,205
He's so all alone.

255
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,369
You're lying,
you know you're lying.

256
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,844
Is you for real?

257
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:27,937
Bullshit.

258
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:29,947
You-you really think your kids
don't know

259
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,209
that you turning tricks?

260
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,478
What are they, retarded?

261
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,042
Is anybody talking to you?

262
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:35,678
Where your kids think
you is right now...

263
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,689
on a Carnival cruise
or some shit?

264
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,690
Shut up, okay?

265
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,952
Like your kids
don't know

266
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,321
what you be doing
late at night?

267
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,294
Shut up, okay? Just shut up.

268
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:45,797
She just trying to help
your lying butt... that's all.

269
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,230
Yeah, I'm just trying to help
your lying ass.

270
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,068
Shh, shh.

271
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,296
Whoa, yo!

272
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:53,237
It don't do no good
to beat on each other

273
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:56,332
about shit we did when we was
bugging and drugging.

274
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,070
Huh?

275
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,408
Now, come on,
let's look at this thing

276
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:01,845
from a positive place.

277
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:07,917
What kind of mother
would you like to be?

278
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:11,719
One your kids can
depend on coming up?

279
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,587
Sade?

280
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:18,494
I don't have nothing to say.

281
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,725
See?

282
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,234
Khaila, what about your kids?

283
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:28,337
I ain't got no kids.

284
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,908
Here, look where you are.

285
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,214
- I'll park the car.
- Okay.

286
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:45,553
That always happens, though.

287
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:46,819
Look.

288
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,918
Oh, my God, Mom.

289
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,326
Here he is.

290
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:51,852
He's so small.

291
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,125
Mm-hmm.

292
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:56,191
C-Can I call you back? Bye.

293
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,901
Oh...

294
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:02,236
How do you get clothes
that small?

295
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:03,639
Leprechauns.

296
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,778
This is your sister,
little guy.

297
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,555
Shh, shh...

298
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:21,786
Can I hold him?

299
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,158
Yes.

300
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:27,131
Watch his head.

301
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,134
What do I do?

302
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,136
Just rock him a little bit,

303
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,661
but-but don't look
right in his face, okay?

304
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:36,675
Crack babies sometimes
have trouble with that.

305
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,108
Hey there, small stuff.

306
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:41,442
That's what your daddy
used to call you.

307
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:50,047
Oh... coochie coochie coo.

308
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,692
He doesn't like me.

309
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,660
It's not that, Hannah.

310
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:59,152
Of course he likes you.
It's not that.

311
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,859
Where are you going?

312
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,060
I told Jenny I'd come over.

313
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:05,900
You're not upset,
are you, Hannah?

314
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,565
No.

315
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,972
Well, why don't you bring
her back to see the baby?

316
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:11,407
I don't think so.

317
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:12,808
Why not?

318
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:14,904
Well, be home by 5:00.

319
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,438
Bye.

320
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:20,145
Oh, I forgot the formula.

321
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:25,751
Shh, shh, shh.

322
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,988
Shh...

323
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:46,439
What'd we learn today, buddy?
You keep your...

324
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:49,003
- Eye... eye on the ball!
- That's right, and then,

325
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:51,844
when you swing the bat,
you got to swing...

326
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:53,852
- Level!
- Level, level, right.

327
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:55,319
- Level!
- And then what do you do

328
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:56,446
when you hit the ball?

329
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:58,513
What do you got to do?
You got to...

330
00:20:58,557 --> 00:20:59,717
- Run like crazy!
- Run like crazy!

331
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,817
You run to first base, and
then he goes to second base.

332
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,728
- Second base!
- Then he goes to third base.

333
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,959
- Then he goes to third base.
- Then he slides

334
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:09,693
all the way home!

335
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:11,430
And then he goes
all the way home!

336
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,768
Right.

337
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:21,505
Ooh, you giving your daddy's
hair a cream rinse?

338
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:23,981
- I hit a home run! Wham!
- Where are you going?

339
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:25,174
To Carrie's.

340
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,616
No, no, no, no,
wait a minute now.

341
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:27,778
Mom...

342
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,185
No, listen,
I got this letter,

343
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:30,984
and I want to read it
to you... listen.

344
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,523
"It is accordingly

345
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:35,994
"therefore ordered
that Isaiah Richards,

346
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:37,755
- a minor..."
- That's me!

347
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,457
"Shall be, to all

348
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,557
"legal intents and purposes,

349
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,195
the child of Charles
and Margaret Lewin."

350
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:47,637
Poor kid... you're stuck
with them now.

351
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:48,970
Very funny.

352
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,201
No, wait, Hannah, don't go.

353
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,675
Don't go. We want to celebrate.

354
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,972
Mom, I can't.

355
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:54,535
- Yes, you...
- Not tonight.

356
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,013
Bye, kiddo.

357
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,743
Kiddo! Kiddo! Kiddo! Kiddo!

358
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:59,546
Hannah...

359
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:00,711
I'll call.

360
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:03,084
Kiddo, kiddo! Kiddo!

361
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,885
You know, just because
she's a teenager...

362
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:07,391
Kiddo, kiddo, kiddo, kiddo...

363
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:08,484
Ooh.

364
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:09,892
Do you want to go out?

365
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:12,624
Oh, you know he can't sit still
in a restaurant.

366
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:15,462
Take this. Ugh!

367
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,401
All right, let's call out
for a pizza.

368
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,097
Pizza, pizza, pizza.

369
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:21,901
We'll get him to bed early,
then, uh, you and I can...

370
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,238
- What shape is a pizza?
- A big bowl like this!

371
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,335
What's that called?

372
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:49,299
- Mommy.
- Excuse me.

373
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:52,098
Sorry.

374
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,695
Glad you made it.

375
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:15,086
You see who it is up there?

376
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,685
It's Hannah.

377
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:26,070
Mommy, look!

378
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:27,628
Isaiah, shh.

379
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,118
Hannah! Hannah!

380
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:53,697
Boo!

381
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:00,997
No!

382
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,040
No! No!

383
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,520
Just stop it.

384
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,400
Yeah!

385
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,566
Why did you even bring him?

386
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,768
It was my play.

387
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,970
You knew he would do
something like this.

388
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:41,602
He always does.

389
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,137
Yes, and you know
he cannot help it.

390
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:44,739
Hey!

391
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:47,980
Hannah, he's...
he ju... Oh...

392
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,885
You know he adores you.

393
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:51,548
Just try not to be so angry.

394
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,989
I'm not angry!

395
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,525
Yes, you are,
and it's okay.

396
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,992
Oh, please.

397
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:58,861
He was so proud of you...

398
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,728
jumping up and down,
calling out your name.

399
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:01,858
Yeah, I know.

400
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,924
I heard him.

401
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:04,993
And so did everybody else.

402
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:17,176
I just wanted Mom to see it.

403
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:30,893
Hannah?

404
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:32,294
What?

405
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,763
Can I tell you something?

406
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,858
Yeah, whatever, Mom.

407
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:42,401
When I heard you sing tonight...

408
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:49,981
I thought, "There's Hannah,

409
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:52,415
doing something
I can't begin to do."

410
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:54,681
Right.

411
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,655
It gave me such pleasure.

412
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:09,698
Good morning!

413
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:10,929
Good morning.

414
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,095
What you doing?

415
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:14,071
Jumping.

416
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:15,937
Boy, your mama ain't teach you
to knock

417
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:18,272
before you just come
barging in somebody's room?

418
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,335
This is my room.
Aunt Joe said.

419
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:22,540
We just lending it to you.

420
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,209
No, you just renting it.

421
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,184
You better get your little
skinny self dressed

422
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:29,187
if you're going to
go to school today.

423
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:30,347
Daycare.

424
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:34,155
Well, you got to be dressed
for daycare, too.

425
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:36,251
They ain't gonna take you
in no pajamas.

426
00:26:36,295 --> 00:26:39,287
Josette's in the bathroom.

427
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:41,765
Don't I know it.

428
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,960
Josie, let's go.

429
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:44,901
You better wake up Mama, Amir.

430
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,131
I ain't taking you
to no daycare.

431
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:54,979
Come on, Amir.

432
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:57,004
I'll take you.

433
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:09,160
Amir!

434
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:11,560
Where's my sugar?

435
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:16,724
Thank you. Go.

436
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:41,623
- Khaila.
- Hey.

437
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,786
Excuse me.

438
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:43,954
Got your living situation

439
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,121
straightened out?

440
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,154
Mm-hmm.

441
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:49,190
Job?

442
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:55,665
I'd appreciate an answer.

443
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:58,642
I got a room.

444
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,942
You ever had a room
to yourself before?

445
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:05,916
Then stop complaining.

446
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:09,352
Let's get to work.

447
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:11,379
You been reading?

448
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:12,913
Some.

449
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,549
Some ain't good enough.

450
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:17,755
Well, the book is dumb.

451
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,526
How you know
if you ain't been reading it?

452
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:23,227
'Cause I am reading it.

453
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,236
Good.

454
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,238
So, tell me...

455
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:29,934
what's been happening with

456
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:32,443
George...

457
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,604
and Katherine?

458
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:39,515
Kath-er-ine done gone
and got herself knocked up.

459
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:43,848
She happy?

460
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:47,587
Don't say.

461
00:28:49,795 --> 00:28:52,093
Why you doing this, Khaila?

462
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:56,396
Oh, we're gonna share now?

463
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:01,127
You're wasting our time here.

464
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:03,607
Let's just forget about it,
'cause it's useless

465
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:04,904
unless you want to do it.

466
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:06,409
I already know how to read.

467
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:08,777
Well, I don't want
to read this bullshit.

468
00:29:08,814 --> 00:29:10,406
Then why you busting my ass?

469
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:13,748
Look, I have my lunch
sitting at home waiting on me.

470
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:28,190
"Kath-er-ine visits the clinic.

471
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:30,201
"The doctor tells her

472
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:34,433
"to be careful

00:29:34,473 --> 00:29:36,464

The doctor..."

479
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:04,294
Khaila, what's the matter?

480
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:06,736
"...tells her
not to drink any

She should get lots of sleep."

485
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,947
Khaila?

486
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,982
Look at me.

487
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:36,395
What's wrong?

488
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,029
I threw him away.

489
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:46,199
My baby.

490
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:48,974
Threw him in the garbage can.

491
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,445
I killed him.

492
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:58,684
Killed him.

493
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:03,856
Oh, God.

494
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:05,988
Oh, my God.

495
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:22,204
You got a book about that?

496
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,528
Hey, how you doing?

497
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,553
Hi.

498
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:48,963
Oh.

499
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:55,544
Hello?!

500
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,980
Amir?!

501
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:00,143
Josie?!

502
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,448
Oh, my...

503
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:05,649
What happened?

504
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,715
They gone in the ambulance.

505
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:15,831
She was bleeding
all over the bed.

506
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:17,357
She wouldn't move.

507
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:19,700
I cooked supper,
and I went to call her,

508
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:21,706
but she wouldn't move.

509
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,300
Doctor say she lost a baby.

510
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:26,469
What baby?

511
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:29,241
Hey, little man.

512
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,145
You okay?

513
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:34,508
Y'all hungry?

514
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:36,486
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

515
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:57,732
Whoo! Whoo, yeah.

516
00:32:57,776 --> 00:32:59,903
Can I give you
a hand there?

517
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:01,138
No, I got it.

518
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:03,113
You sure? I got a little cousin
about that age.

519
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,843
You know, they can do damage
to your back.

520
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:06,475
I said I got it.

521
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:08,247
Okay.

522
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:11,221
Lord, boy, you heavy.

523
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:13,554
Mama...

524
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:15,218
It's okay. Go back to sleep.

525
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,251
I'm going to stay
with you tonight.

526
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:19,661
Pizza.

527
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:23,828
You gonna have your pizza.

528
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,353
I'm sor...

529
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:52,920
Eddie Hughes.

530
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:55,262
You know, I didn't
meet you before.

531
00:33:57,268 --> 00:33:59,133
I got to get back inside.

532
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,694
To your kids?

533
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:01,865
They ain't my kids,

534
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:04,033
and why you got to be lurking
up here on my floor?

535
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:05,201
I'm not lurking.

536
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:06,767
I'm just having a smoke.

537
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:08,642
Well, smoke somewhere else,
goddamn it.

538
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,513
I'm a working man on vacation...

539
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,540
up from Tampa.

540
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:15,280
You ever been to Tampa?

541
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,311
Oh, this look like
a vacation spot to you?

542
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:22,825
Actually, my brother lives here.

543
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:25,159
Yeah, you know,
he don't like to smoke, so...

544
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:29,326
I'm just visiting him.

545
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:30,959
We're, uh...

546
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:33,061
we're in the music business.

547
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:34,799
Mm-hmm.

548
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:36,830
I was just, uh...

549
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:40,242
working on a song about, uh...

550
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,405
concrete.

551
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:44,108
Check it out.

552
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,402
I got to work
on the melody a little bit.

553
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,910
I hope you good
at something else.

554
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:45,339
- Hello, Mama.
- Uh, Khaila.

555
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:48,106
Uh, there's some leftover pasta
in the fridge...

556
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,272
Bye, Khaila. So long, sweetpea.

557
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:51,305
And, uh, laundry needs
to go in the dryer.

558
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:52,316
I'm out the door, honey.

559
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,510
Okay.

560
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:56,820
Give me a kiss. Mwa!

561
00:35:56,855 --> 00:35:58,652
Oh, I might be
a few minutes late tonight,

562
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,681
but you can stay, huh?

563
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,152
Bye, girls.

564
00:36:16,241 --> 00:36:17,765
The Fredericks residence.

565
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:18,935
Khaila?

566
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:20,271
Yeah?

567
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:21,505
It's Gussie.

568
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:24,174
Can we meet somewhere?

569
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,815
He ain't dead?

570
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:34,985
My baby ain't dead?

571
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:40,487
Well, now, where is he?

572
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,967
In the city,
living with a family in DePaul.

573
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:47,003
Well...

574
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:52,203
Well, I got to see him.

575
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:54,268
Slow down, Khaila.

576
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,371
There are a lot of issues
involved here.

577
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:59,281
He's been legally adopted.

578
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:01,877
So? I got to see my baby,
Gussie.

579
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,080
Where is he?

580
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:04,611
Okay, we're going to work
on that,

581
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:06,123
but it's going
to take some time.

582
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:08,591
- No. Come on, let's go.
- I'm on your side.

583
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:10,355
I'm going to help you,
but it's going

584
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,295
- No, no, no, no, no.
- To take some time,

585
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,594
and you're going to have
to be patient, Khaila.

586
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:15,758
I can't be patient.

587
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,926
- Listen.
- I need to see my baby.

588
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:18,559
Listen to me,
listen to me, Khaila.

589
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:20,730
Don't let

590
00:37:20,772 --> 00:37:24,401
everything you worked
so hard for fall apart.

591
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:01,938
Hey,

592
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,345
what are you doing in here?

593
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:04,575
Nothing.

594
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,276
Looking for Gussie.

595
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:07,545
Oh, she's in the hall.

596
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:09,576
Thanks.

597
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:17,618
- I'll call you tonight.
- Yeah.

598
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:20,324
Pop the hood.

599
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:27,370
See you, buddy.

600
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:29,498
- Bye.
- I'll call you tonight.

601
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,531
- Bye, Daddy, bye, Daddy.
- Have a good trip.

602
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:32,634
Take your ticket.

603
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:33,939
Take me, please.

604
00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:36,071
You wouldn't like it, sweetie.

605
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:38,082
It's in a big city with...
it smells,

606
00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:41,608
in a big room
with men with no hair.

607
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,711
Bye, Daddy.

608
00:38:43,755 --> 00:38:44,881
Bye, Daddy.

609
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:48,082
Sorry.

610
00:38:48,126 --> 00:38:49,923
Oh, don't be sad.

611
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:51,622
Daddy will be back
in two days.

612
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:52,788
Look who's here.

613
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,923
Aw... two days.

614
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:57,332
You know what two is?

615
00:38:57,368 --> 00:39:00,428
One, two... that's not long.

616
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:02,598
Besides, Heidi's going
to take you to the park now.

617
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,039
Then after the park,

618
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:05,906
you're going to take a nap,

619
00:39:05,977 --> 00:39:07,842
and drink your apple juice.

620
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:09,540
Use your sipper cup.

621
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,105
And Mama's going
to come home

622
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,913
right after work like
I always do, okay?

623
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:15,145
Good night.

624
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,154
Uh-huh, and you're going
to draw me a picture?

625
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,155
Yes.

626
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,713
- Of what? Of an airplane?
- Yes.

627
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:21,657
With two wings,
flying up in the sky.

628
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:26,356
- Up in the sky!
- Up in the sky, yeah.

629
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:28,922
How many wings
does an airplane have?

630
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:30,160
Two.

631
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,294
Two! How many hands
does Isaiah have?

632
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:33,462
Two.

633
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:35,335
And how many eyes
does Isaiah have?

634
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,533
Two.

635
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,667
And how many kisses
is Mama going to get?

636
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:39,767
Two.

637
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:43,675
Oh, you're my boy.

638
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,080
Okay, have fun at the park.

639
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:47,448
I want to race.

640
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,544
Okay. Bye-bye, honey.

641
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,851
Bye, Mommy.

642
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,824
W-W-W-W-Whee!

643
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:57,885
Okay, now, guess
where we're going?

644
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:58,896
Where?

645
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,262
To the park.

646
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:13,701
What are you going to go on
when you go in there first, huh?

647
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,735
The slide?

648
00:40:19,317 --> 00:40:21,717
Ah, push.

649
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:28,321
Ready? One, two, three, up.

650
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:31,294
Good boy. Okay.

651
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:33,991
Heidi, over here.

652
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,497
How you doing?

653
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:36,557
Good.

654
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,660
So, can you come?

655
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:39,931
I don't know.

656
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:40,995
I'm pretty tired.

657
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:42,005
So, can you get off?

658
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:43,131
I don't know.

659
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:45,438
They're supposed to go out.

660
00:41:22,547 --> 00:41:24,947
Hello, Isaiah.

661
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,973
I get so nervous.

662
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:30,781
Hi.

663
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,749
Hello?

664
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:52,592
Hello?

665
00:42:52,637 --> 00:42:54,537
Miss Richards.

666
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,005
You're late.

667
00:42:56,107 --> 00:42:57,597
I'm sorry.

668
00:43:02,781 --> 00:43:05,841
Gussie said
you was a real good lawyer.

669
00:43:05,884 --> 00:43:08,785
Yeah. Now, she's explained
some of this to me,

670
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:11,254
but there's still
a lot of holes here.

671
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:15,055
She tells me you'd like to
reinstate your parental rights.

672
00:43:19,798 --> 00:43:21,766
You gave your child
up for adoption.

673
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,960
Now you want him back.

674
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:27,231
No, I never gave my child up
for no adoption.

675
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:28,671
You left him in an alley.

676
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:29,798
You abandoned him

677
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:31,604
and made no effort
to find him again.

678
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:33,133
Legally, that's the same thing.

679
00:43:35,447 --> 00:43:38,075
Well, that's 'cause
I thought he was dead.

680
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:39,879
No one ever sent you any letters

681
00:43:39,918 --> 00:43:41,681
informing you
of his whereabouts?

682
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:43,687
Nope.

683
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:46,451
Or of the Lewins'
intent to adopt him?

684
00:43:46,491 --> 00:43:48,755
Mm-mmm.

685
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,192
Now, Miss Richards,
you know

686
00:43:50,228 --> 00:43:51,388
you couldn't read very well

687
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:53,124
before you went into
the rehab program.

688
00:43:53,164 --> 00:43:55,462
You sure you didn't throw
away any official papers?

689
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,992
No. I ain't never got no papers.

690
00:43:59,037 --> 00:44:01,437
Not even in jail?

691
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:03,634
If I would've got some papers
like that,

692
00:44:03,675 --> 00:44:05,768
don't you think
I would've remembered?

693
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:16,714
You don't like me all that much,
do you?

694
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:18,619
I don't like what put you in

695
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,715
this situation, Miss Richards.

696
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,892
How do I know that when
I help you get your boy back,

697
00:44:24,929 --> 00:44:26,829
you're not going to go back
to smoking rock

698
00:44:26,865 --> 00:44:28,127
and leave him again?

699
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:32,068
'Cause I'm telling you
I'm through with all that.

700
00:44:32,103 --> 00:44:34,298
Oh, well,
that's what you all say.

701
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:36,933
You ain't got
to talk down to me.

702
00:44:36,975 --> 00:44:38,203
I can pay.

703
00:44:38,243 --> 00:44:39,608
There's no fee involved here.

704
00:44:39,644 --> 00:44:41,839
We take on cases
that are socially relevant.

705
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,939
If we win them,
they set legal precedent.

706
00:44:43,982 --> 00:44:46,314
Your case fits that profile.

707
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:49,149
The fee's taken care of
by donations.

708
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:53,354
It's going to be tough.

709
00:44:53,391 --> 00:44:55,518
The family he's with is white,

710
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,118
they treated him well.

711
00:44:57,161 --> 00:44:59,186
They'll fight this.

712
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:05,300
But I'm his mother.

713
00:45:05,336 --> 00:45:06,769
Well, I'm sure that white woman

714
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:08,362
feels fairly strongly
that she is,

715
00:45:08,406 --> 00:45:10,874
and there are a lot of people
who'll agree with her.

716
00:45:26,357 --> 00:45:28,052
Mommy, pussycat.

717
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:32,222
The owl and the pussycat...

718
00:45:32,263 --> 00:45:34,754
Went to sea.

719
00:45:34,799 --> 00:45:38,496
In a beautiful pea-green...

720
00:45:38,536 --> 00:45:39,901
Boat.

721
00:45:39,938 --> 00:45:41,405
They took some...

722
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:42,599
Honey.

723
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,801
And plenty of...

724
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:46,309
Money.

725
00:45:46,344 --> 00:45:54,183
Wrapped up
in a five-pound... note.

726
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:57,016
Night-night, sweet boy.

727
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:40,327
Charlie?

728
00:46:40,365 --> 00:46:42,026
Margaret, hello.

729
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:45,667
She wants him back.

730
00:46:45,703 --> 00:46:46,897
What?

731
00:46:46,938 --> 00:46:49,202
Who? Who wants him back?

732
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,208
I don't know.

733
00:46:51,242 --> 00:46:54,109
We got a letter
from some legal service.

734
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:57,114
She never signed away
her rights.

735
00:46:57,148 --> 00:47:00,174
She's going to challenge
the adoption.

736
00:47:00,218 --> 00:47:02,778
Where did she come from?

737
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:09,918
What are we going to do?

738
00:47:09,961 --> 00:47:12,088
Listen, sweetheart,
it-it's going to be all right.

739
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:13,256
No, it's not.

740
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:15,424
Mommy, I want Daddy.

741
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:17,195
Oh...

742
00:47:17,235 --> 00:47:19,669
Mommy, I want Daddy.

743
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:23,398
Daddy's not home.

744
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:25,807
I want Daddy.

745
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,333
So do I.

746
00:47:27,378 --> 00:47:29,938
I want him to be here.

747
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,641
I want Daddy.

748
00:47:31,683 --> 00:47:33,947
She's claiming she never
received any notice

749
00:47:34,052 --> 00:47:35,576
to terminate
parental rights.

750
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:36,780
That can't be.

751
00:47:36,821 --> 00:47:38,584
You handled that yourself,
right?

752
00:47:38,623 --> 00:47:41,490
Look, this is what I do
for a living.

753
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:45,963
I followed every procedure...
the newspaper notifications,

754
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:48,828
computer checks of prisons,
the welfare rolls...

755
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,061
I mean, we even hired
a-a private detective

756
00:47:51,102 --> 00:47:53,195
with our own money
to look for relatives,

757
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:55,102
but you can't find
somebody on the street

758
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:56,572
if they don't want to be found.

759
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:58,268
And what does it matter, anyway?

760
00:47:58,309 --> 00:48:00,641
The adoption is final...
it can't be reversed.

761
00:48:00,678 --> 00:48:03,010
Oh, I'm afraid it can.

762
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:04,912
The court can vacate a judgment

763
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:07,109
if it was entered
into by default,

764
00:48:07,151 --> 00:48:09,585
and it will vacate
if there's a child involved.

765
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,679
She's going to have a right
to be heard.

766
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:14,123
We're talking about a woman
who is a junkie,

767
00:48:14,158 --> 00:48:15,921
who put her kid
in a garbage can.

768
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:17,688
Someone who should be arrested,

769
00:48:17,729 --> 00:48:19,663
not given back
her parental rights.

770
00:48:19,697 --> 00:48:23,565
Well, that's what
you'll have to prove.

771
00:48:23,601 --> 00:48:25,125
Look, I know you came to me

772
00:48:25,169 --> 00:48:27,034
because you thought
it would help

773
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:28,504
to have a black attorney,

774
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:31,133
but understand this is
a difficult situation.

775
00:48:31,175 --> 00:48:33,541
Is that a polite way
of saying no?

776
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:36,445
I said I'd think
about it, and I will.

777
00:48:36,481 --> 00:48:38,415
This isn't a simple issue.

778
00:48:38,449 --> 00:48:39,939
You might raise a black child

779
00:48:39,984 --> 00:48:42,714
with the best intentions
in the world, colorblind,

780
00:48:42,754 --> 00:48:45,587
but in the end,
the world is still out there.

781
00:48:45,623 --> 00:48:47,147
He needs to know who he is.

782
00:48:47,191 --> 00:48:50,058
A child should be
with his parents.

783
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:52,085
We agree there.

784
00:48:54,565 --> 00:48:58,592
Whoo... pretty.

785
00:48:58,636 --> 00:49:00,866
Again. More bubbles.

786
00:49:00,905 --> 00:49:03,567
More bubbles, Hannah.

787
00:49:06,077 --> 00:49:07,635
More!

788
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:09,043
More, more!

789
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,709
Come on, Isaiah,
we've been doing this all day.

790
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,775
More bubbles, Hannah!

791
00:49:14,819 --> 00:49:16,810
Bubbles!

792
00:49:18,723 --> 00:49:20,588
Isaiah.

793
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:22,684
- Give me that.
- Isaiah.

794
00:49:22,727 --> 00:49:25,195
Isaiah, look at our hands.

795
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:30,059
What's different about them?

796
00:49:30,101 --> 00:49:32,331
My hand's smaller.

797
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:34,531
Bubbles, bubbles!

798
00:49:42,914 --> 00:49:46,281
Hannah, come set the table
for dinner.

799
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,959
Stop switching channels.

800
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,223
I want to see some cartoons.

801
00:49:58,262 --> 00:50:00,457
Give me that thing, boy.

802
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:01,726
Oh, hey.

803
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:06,364
Where's your mama?

804
00:50:06,404 --> 00:50:07,632
Out.

805
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:09,731
Girl, is you crazy?

806
00:50:09,774 --> 00:50:13,175
You don't just let some strange
man come walking up in here.

807
00:50:13,211 --> 00:50:15,645
He gave us all this TV stuff.

808
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,944
Hey, little man, help me
put all these tools away

809
00:50:17,982 --> 00:50:19,847
and clean this mess up,
and I'll show you

810
00:50:19,884 --> 00:50:21,442
how to work
the video games, okay?

811
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:22,747
Yeah.

812
00:50:22,787 --> 00:50:25,085
Help him put
all them tools away,

813
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:27,249
so he can get on out of here.

814
00:50:27,291 --> 00:50:28,952
Look, I didn't mean nothing
by all this.

815
00:50:28,993 --> 00:50:30,620
I just thought the kids
would like it.

816
00:50:30,661 --> 00:50:32,288
Mmm.

817
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:34,696
Hey, there's a <i>Scooby</i>- <i>Doo</i>
marathon on tonight.

818
00:50:34,732 --> 00:50:36,495
Yeah...!

819
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:38,468
Well, you can Scooby-Doo
your butt on out of here.

820
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:39,491
Let's go.

821
00:50:42,907 --> 00:50:43,896
Here.

822
00:50:43,941 --> 00:50:46,341
No, no, you keep that,
all right?

823
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:49,403
Remember what I said:
Honorary cable man.

824
00:50:49,447 --> 00:50:51,381
See you later.

825
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:53,178
Don't wait up for me.

826
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:54,343
Why are you

827
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:55,682
so mean to him?

828
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,985
He act kind of stupid,
but he's nice.

829
00:50:59,023 --> 00:51:03,255
Yeah, real stupid...
and a little too nice.

830
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:13,201
Hey, pretty lady, how you doing?

831
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:15,762
Why don't you let me
carry that for you?

832
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:17,831
I'm doing just
fine by myself.

833
00:51:17,875 --> 00:51:19,103
Oh, come on, I got it.

834
00:51:19,143 --> 00:51:21,839
Now, see, look, now,
was that so hard? Come on.

835
00:51:21,879 --> 00:51:24,404
There you go.

836
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:25,710
Let me ask you something.

837
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,274
What did I do
that was so bad?

838
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:28,683
You ain't had no business

839
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:30,584
walking in on them kids
like that.

840
00:51:30,621 --> 00:51:34,489
You didn't like my singing
much either, right?

841
00:51:34,525 --> 00:51:35,753
What's happening?

842
00:51:35,793 --> 00:51:37,420
So, what kind of
music do you like?

843
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:38,519
None of your business.

844
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:40,860
Bet you like rap, right?

845
00:51:40,898 --> 00:51:44,595
Dr. Dre, Salt & Pepa, right?

846
00:51:44,635 --> 00:51:47,001
See, that's why
I can't get no gigs.

847
00:51:47,038 --> 00:51:49,563
These youngsters today...
they don't even know

848
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:51,336
what a bass guitar
sounds like.

849
00:51:51,375 --> 00:51:53,707
You know what the key
to playing bass is?

850
00:51:53,744 --> 00:51:57,009
Nope... and I really don't care.

851
00:51:58,749 --> 00:52:00,011
Thank you.

852
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:01,641
Big hands.

853
00:52:01,686 --> 00:52:03,119
See that?

854
00:52:05,022 --> 00:52:07,286
That's pitiful.

855
00:52:08,326 --> 00:52:10,191
I like you.

856
00:52:10,227 --> 00:52:12,559
You don't know nothing about me.

857
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:15,565
Well, do me a favor...
tell me something.

858
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,590
I don't like
fast-talking brothers

859
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:18,966
who get up in my face.

860
00:52:19,003 --> 00:52:20,334
Well, there you go.

861
00:52:20,371 --> 00:52:22,896
I like pretty ladies
that don't like

862
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:26,307
fast-talking brothers
who get up in their face.

863
00:52:37,955 --> 00:52:39,286
Later.

864
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:47,487
All right.

865
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,431
Sorry. Had to bring her.

866
00:52:53,471 --> 00:52:56,167
Miss Fredericks is going to
kill me if she find out.

867
00:52:56,207 --> 00:52:58,266
I don't think the child
will tell her.

868
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,876
How much does this place cost?

869
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:05,074
It's $300 a month.

870
00:53:05,116 --> 00:53:09,485
You crazy? I can't
afford no $300 a month.

871
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,284
Well, how much
can you afford?

872
00:53:12,323 --> 00:53:14,450
I don't know. Maybe $150.

873
00:53:14,492 --> 00:53:15,459
That way.

874
00:53:15,493 --> 00:53:16,824
If I stop saving.

875
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:19,159
Well, we'll get the rest
taken care of

876
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:20,925
by Aid to Dependent Children.

877
00:53:20,965 --> 00:53:23,695
I ain't got no
dependent children.

878
00:53:23,734 --> 00:53:25,634
Oh, you will.

879
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:36,973
All right, get it cleaned up,
find some furniture,

880
00:53:37,048 --> 00:53:38,515
and fix the window.

881
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:40,717
For what?

882
00:53:40,751 --> 00:53:42,582
It's just gonna get broke again.

883
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:44,178
Somebody gonna look in here

884
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,984
and see what I got and take it.

885
00:53:46,057 --> 00:53:48,890
Fix it so the sun can shine in,
so you can look out,

886
00:53:48,926 --> 00:53:50,985
watch your boy play
in the courtyard.

887
00:53:51,095 --> 00:53:55,225
And get rid of your boyfriend.

888
00:53:57,368 --> 00:53:59,461
I ain't got no boyfriend.

889
00:53:59,503 --> 00:54:03,166
Eddie Hughes?

890
00:54:03,207 --> 00:54:05,937
Oh, so, you spying on me now?

891
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:07,102
It's part of my job.

892
00:54:07,144 --> 00:54:08,236
They're going to try

893
00:54:08,279 --> 00:54:10,577
and make you look
like the Devil in court.

894
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:13,481
There can't be anything
you do to help them.

895
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:16,586
He's married.

896
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,645
He ain't married.

897
00:54:18,689 --> 00:54:20,384
You asked him?

898
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:23,516
You jealous?

899
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:29,957
Don't flatter yourself.

900
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,525
This goes way beyond you.

901
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:36,506
Black babies belong
with black mothers.

902
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:39,941
I'm not going to let you
do anything to mess that up.

903
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:42,810
Now, you break it off
with this guy,

904
00:54:42,847 --> 00:54:44,439
or I drop the case.

905
00:54:49,587 --> 00:54:52,283
This is your first place,
isn't it?

906
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:57,291
Yeah.

907
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:02,896
Welcome home.

908
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:18,741
I'm leaving.

909
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:19,749
Not without paying

910
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:21,717
for the rest of the time
you owe, you ain't.

911
00:55:21,752 --> 00:55:23,947
Why Khaila gotta go, Mom?

912
00:55:24,021 --> 00:55:26,581
Shut up, boy. My head hurts.

913
00:55:26,624 --> 00:55:27,921
I don't want her to go.

914
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:29,721
Don't nobody care
what you want!

915
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:30,954
Now go on out of here!

916
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:33,621
Tell Josette to comb the naps
out your head!

917
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:35,655
Do something. Go!

918
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:38,394
What you looking at?

919
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:41,802
It ain't right for you
to talk to him like that.

920
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,363
Well, when you get your own kid,

921
00:55:43,407 --> 00:55:45,739
you talk to him the way
you want to talk to him.

922
00:55:45,776 --> 00:55:49,212
This kid here is mine... mine!

923
00:55:49,246 --> 00:55:50,770
Just take your funky ass

924
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:52,907
outta here if you going!

925
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:54,440
Bye.

926
00:55:54,485 --> 00:55:56,009
Go on. Leave!

927
00:56:20,277 --> 00:56:22,643
Hello, sweetheart.

928
00:56:24,148 --> 00:56:25,547
How'd you find me?

929
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:26,880
Ah. Shorty Big-head.

930
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:29,044
Gave him a pack
of Now & Laters...

931
00:56:29,086 --> 00:56:30,747
he gave you up like that.

932
00:56:30,788 --> 00:56:32,949
Hi, Khaila.

933
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,081
Hi.

934
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:36,024
Come on, guys.

935
00:56:38,862 --> 00:56:41,888
Ooh, your place is nice.

936
00:56:41,932 --> 00:56:44,492
Yeah. All this furniture.

937
00:56:44,535 --> 00:56:46,298
Why didn't you tell me
you were moving?

938
00:56:46,337 --> 00:56:48,237
You know, I would've helped
or something.

939
00:56:48,272 --> 00:56:50,240
This your boy's?

940
00:56:50,274 --> 00:56:51,263
Mm-hmm.

941
00:56:51,308 --> 00:56:53,208
Where he at?

942
00:56:53,244 --> 00:56:55,872
I told you that
a hundred times already.

943
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:58,438
Put that stuff down.
That ain't yours.

944
00:56:58,482 --> 00:57:00,313
Check it out.

945
00:57:00,351 --> 00:57:01,545
I got four tickets

946
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:03,917
to the James Brown concert
tonight.

947
00:57:03,954 --> 00:57:06,013
I know you think my music
is older than dirt,

948
00:57:06,056 --> 00:57:07,421
but I'm going
to show you that

949
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:08,686
it can still be funky.

950
00:57:08,726 --> 00:57:10,250
Hey!

951
00:57:10,294 --> 00:57:13,695
Dirt... that's something
you should know a lot about.

952
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:17,833
Kids, sit tight.

953
00:57:17,868 --> 00:57:20,496
Would you...
outside, please?

954
00:57:21,505 --> 00:57:22,665
Humor me.

955
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:29,005
Give me that.

956
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:34,242
You want to tell me
something?

957
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:37,880
Uh-uh. Maybe you ought
to tell me something.

958
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:40,822
Okay. What do you
want to know?

959
00:57:40,858 --> 00:57:41,825
Huh?

960
00:57:41,859 --> 00:57:44,794
Maybe about... your wife?

961
00:57:44,828 --> 00:57:47,092
Okay.

962
00:57:51,535 --> 00:57:55,528
We're separated... all right?
We don't even talk.

963
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:58,973
Oh, you on vacation
from that, too?

964
00:57:59,076 --> 00:58:00,737
Khaila...

965
00:58:00,778 --> 00:58:03,042
you know,
it's a whole big mess, and...

966
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,911
I didn't want to get into...

967
00:58:05,015 --> 00:58:06,983
But you still married.

968
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:11,920
It don't mean nothing.

969
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:13,923
Oh, it don't?

970
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:15,390
Don't mean nothing?

971
00:58:15,426 --> 00:58:17,758
Don't mean nothing
at all, huh?

972
00:58:17,795 --> 00:58:19,763
I'm not trying to run a game
on you, Khaila.

973
00:58:19,797 --> 00:58:20,821
Somebody is always

974
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:22,855
trying to run a game on me.

975
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,128
You ain't no different.

976
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:26,568
Walking around here
carrying groceries,

977
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:28,901
singing little silly songs
and shit.

978
00:58:28,939 --> 00:58:30,406
You ain't nothing.

979
00:58:30,441 --> 00:58:33,308
You just like every other
sorry ass man I ever knew...

980
00:58:33,344 --> 00:58:34,606
bullshit!

981
00:58:34,645 --> 00:58:35,907
Stay the hell away from me,

982
00:58:35,946 --> 00:58:38,244
and stay away from them kids!

983
00:58:45,656 --> 00:58:47,214
Shit.

984
00:59:01,572 --> 00:59:05,167
You're letting me wear
these pearls?

985
00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:06,471
Your pearls.

986
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:48,916
Just stay calm.

987
00:59:48,953 --> 00:59:51,581
He's going to try his best
to get a rise out of you

988
00:59:51,622 --> 00:59:53,613
any way he can.

989
00:59:53,658 --> 00:59:56,593
That will only work
to his advantage.

990
01:00:00,298 --> 01:00:01,959
Who's that?

991
01:00:02,066 --> 01:00:04,500
Khaila.

992
01:00:06,537 --> 01:00:07,731
So...

993
01:00:07,772 --> 01:00:09,262
don't worry about it.

994
01:00:09,307 --> 01:00:11,502
Just... stay with it, okay?

995
01:00:13,778 --> 01:00:15,109
All right?

996
01:00:22,286 --> 01:00:24,618
And how long have you
been clean, Miss Richards?

997
01:00:26,457 --> 01:00:29,858
Two years and one month.

998
01:00:29,894 --> 01:00:31,555
And what made you stop?

999
01:00:38,402 --> 01:00:39,994
Isaiah.

1000
01:00:40,104 --> 01:00:42,129
Could you please speak up,
Miss Richards?

1001
01:00:43,641 --> 01:00:45,268
Isaiah.

1002
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:47,709
What about Isaiah?

1003
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:53,480
How I left him.

1004
01:00:53,517 --> 01:00:56,042
Left him where, Miss Richards?

1005
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:04,960
I just needed to get me a hit...
so bad.

1006
01:01:09,667 --> 01:01:11,134
He was crying.

1007
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:15,605
He was screaming.

1008
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:18,039
Like he was calling my name.

1009
01:01:20,011 --> 01:01:22,411
And that's what made you stop?

1010
01:01:25,916 --> 01:01:27,144
Yes.

1011
01:01:28,352 --> 01:01:30,752
I wanted to hear my baby.

1012
01:01:30,788 --> 01:01:34,053
I didn't want no drugs
taking me out of my head.

1013
01:01:35,226 --> 01:01:40,289
I wanted to fe...
feel that pain.

1014
01:01:40,331 --> 01:01:44,893
I didn't want nothing
to ease that for me.

1015
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:55,010
Do you have a higher power,
Miss Richards?

1016
01:01:55,112 --> 01:01:56,101
Objection!

1017
01:01:56,147 --> 01:01:57,114
Relevance?

1018
01:01:57,148 --> 01:01:58,308
I'll allow it.

1019
01:01:58,349 --> 01:02:00,010
Please answer

1020
01:02:00,051 --> 01:02:01,450
the question.

1021
01:02:01,485 --> 01:02:03,476
Yes, ma'am, I do.

1022
01:02:05,089 --> 01:02:08,252
It's because of Him
that I'm here today.

1023
01:02:08,292 --> 01:02:10,556
Could you explain
what you mean, please?

1024
01:02:13,597 --> 01:02:17,431
Because...
it's because of Him...

1025
01:02:17,468 --> 01:02:22,064
that I have this second chance
to make it up to Isaiah.

1026
01:02:22,106 --> 01:02:25,075
- Oh, shit!
- Mama, I'm thirsty!

1027
01:02:25,109 --> 01:02:26,701
- Watch it.
- Wait-wait-wait, oh, okay.

1028
01:02:26,744 --> 01:02:29,542
There's broken glass everywhere.

1029
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:31,207
I want apple juice.

1030
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:32,806
I don't have apple,
I just have orange.

1031
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:34,818
- I told him that this morning.
- Can I have apple juice?

1032
01:02:34,852 --> 01:02:36,786
- I can get you some lemonade.
- I want apple juice.

1033
01:02:36,821 --> 01:02:38,652
Sit down, Isaiah,
you're going to fall.

1034
01:02:38,689 --> 01:02:40,816
- I want apple juice!
- I don't have apple.

1035
01:02:40,858 --> 01:02:41,984
I want apple juice!

1036
01:02:42,026 --> 01:02:43,220
- Sit down!
- I want apple...

1037
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:46,957
Sit down! Sit down! Sit down!

1038
01:02:48,132 --> 01:02:49,724
I'm going for apple juice.

1039
01:02:49,767 --> 01:02:52,463
Hannah, don't go near this.
I'll be right back.

1040
01:02:52,503 --> 01:02:55,597
Sweetie, it's okay.

1041
01:03:04,415 --> 01:03:05,882
She's a crack addict

1042
01:03:05,916 --> 01:03:08,680
who left her newborn baby
in a garbage heap

1043
01:03:08,719 --> 01:03:11,244
in the dead of winter,
and that damn lawyer

1044
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:13,279
makes her look
like Mother Teresa.

1045
01:03:13,324 --> 01:03:14,552
Shh.

1046
01:03:14,592 --> 01:03:16,924
Higher powers!

1047
01:03:16,961 --> 01:03:19,953
Tell me he was
calling her name.

1048
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:23,898
He was screaming from all
the crack she pumped into him!

1049
01:03:25,402 --> 01:03:27,893
Charlie, how can they think
about giving him back to her?

1050
01:03:27,938 --> 01:03:29,269
They're not going to.

1051
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:31,137
I mean, she's
not a mother.

1052
01:03:31,175 --> 01:03:32,972
She doesn't even know how
to take care of him.

1053
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:35,535
I mean, what,
what if he got sick?

1054
01:03:35,579 --> 01:03:37,877
What if he got hurt
or something?

1055
01:03:37,915 --> 01:03:39,906
She wouldn't know
what to do.

1056
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,617
I'm just so afraid we're
going to lose him.

1057
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:46,714
- What if we lose him?
- We're not going to lose him.

1058
01:03:46,757 --> 01:03:49,089
- I couldn't bear to lose him.
- We're not going to lose him.

1059
01:03:49,126 --> 01:03:50,559
No, but what if we do?

1060
01:03:50,594 --> 01:03:53,654
Margaret, we're not,
we're not going to lose him.

1061
01:03:58,102 --> 01:04:01,299
Charlie, did you see
how beautiful she was?

1062
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:05,069
She was so beautiful.

1063
01:04:07,945 --> 01:04:09,344
I was never no prostitute.

1064
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:11,473
You never took money for sex?

1065
01:04:11,515 --> 01:04:13,176
That was for drugs.

1066
01:04:13,217 --> 01:04:15,913
Well, that makes it okay, then.

1067
01:04:15,953 --> 01:04:16,920
Objection.

1068
01:04:16,954 --> 01:04:18,478
Sustained.

1069
01:04:18,522 --> 01:04:20,990
Who's Isaiah's father?

1070
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,351
I don't know.

1071
01:04:25,396 --> 01:04:28,957
So I assume that he won't be
helping you with child care.

1072
01:04:29,066 --> 01:04:31,466
Who will you turn to, Khaila?

1073
01:04:31,502 --> 01:04:32,969
Is there any kind

1074
01:04:33,003 --> 01:04:34,095
of support system

1075
01:04:34,138 --> 01:04:37,301
that you can depend on
to help you with Isaiah?

1076
01:04:38,342 --> 01:04:41,368
My counselor, Gussie Chestnut,

1077
01:04:41,412 --> 01:04:43,846
my sponsor,

1078
01:04:43,881 --> 01:04:45,610
my friends.

1079
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:48,183
These people
you've just mentioned,

1080
01:04:48,219 --> 01:04:51,279
aren't they all reformed
drug addicts themselves?

1081
01:04:51,322 --> 01:04:54,883
They all been clean
for at least five years.

1082
01:04:54,925 --> 01:04:57,894
Just answer the question,
please, yes or no?

1083
01:04:59,897 --> 01:05:00,864
Yes.

1084
01:05:00,898 --> 01:05:02,160
Couldn't they relapse

1085
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:03,723
at any time?

1086
01:05:03,767 --> 01:05:05,632
I mean, there's no
real assurance

1087
01:05:05,669 --> 01:05:06,636
that you yourself

1088
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:08,262
won't relapse,
is there?

1089
01:05:08,305 --> 01:05:09,829
That's not going to happen.

1090
01:05:09,873 --> 01:05:13,775
"That's not going to happen."

1091
01:05:13,811 --> 01:05:15,142
The pledge

1092
01:05:15,179 --> 01:05:17,010
of a drug-addicted prostitute.

1093
01:05:19,283 --> 01:05:23,185
Seizures, inter-cranial bleeds,
malformed kidneys.

1094
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:25,279
And all these can be
the result of drug use

1095
01:05:25,322 --> 01:05:26,846
while the child is in utero?

1096
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:29,825
Yes, and they're almost always
low-birth-weight babies,

1097
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:32,829
frequently premature,
higher incidence of crib death.

1098
01:05:32,863 --> 01:05:34,592
And later?

1099
01:05:34,632 --> 01:05:37,328
They're usually
highly irritable.

1100
01:05:37,368 --> 01:05:39,529
Some have severe
learning disabilities,

1101
01:05:39,570 --> 01:05:42,767
moodiness, poor coordination.

1102
01:05:42,806 --> 01:05:46,401
Stress usually aggravates
these symptoms.

1103
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:50,937
Can anything be done
to alleviate these problems?

1104
01:05:50,981 --> 01:05:52,312
We don't know for sure,

1105
01:05:52,349 --> 01:05:54,977
but calm, steady,
dependable parenting

1106
01:05:55,052 --> 01:05:56,849
is certainly in the
child's best interest.

1107
01:05:56,887 --> 01:05:59,549
The kind he's receiving
from the Lewins.

1108
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:01,455
I would say so.

1109
01:06:11,568 --> 01:06:13,798
Amir?

1110
01:06:21,779 --> 01:06:23,770
You going to let me in?

1111
01:06:33,924 --> 01:06:35,824
Hey.

1112
01:06:36,827 --> 01:06:38,886
Why are you here?

1113
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:42,629
Came to see you.

1114
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:45,794
That ain't no reason.

1115
01:06:45,836 --> 01:06:48,964
Yes, it is.

1116
01:06:49,006 --> 01:06:51,975
And I brought you something.

1117
01:06:52,009 --> 01:06:54,068
That's his.

1118
01:06:56,246 --> 01:06:57,611
Yeah...

1119
01:06:57,648 --> 01:06:59,616
but I brought it for you.

1120
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:00,742
Hey, boy,

1121
01:07:00,784 --> 01:07:04,117
who you talking to?

1122
01:07:04,154 --> 01:07:06,122
Well, well, well, if it ain't

1123
01:07:06,156 --> 01:07:07,783
Miss High-and-Mighty.

1124
01:07:07,825 --> 01:07:10,293
The rent gone way up,
all right?

1125
01:07:10,327 --> 01:07:12,921
Now, wait, wait,
hold on, wait up.

1126
01:07:12,963 --> 01:07:15,193
What, what, what, what you think
I should charge her?

1127
01:07:15,232 --> 01:07:17,860
What you think
I should charge her, huh?

1128
01:07:17,901 --> 01:07:19,766
Something high, right?

1129
01:07:19,803 --> 01:07:20,770
$200?

1130
01:07:20,804 --> 01:07:22,169
- $250!
- Mm-hmm.

1131
01:07:22,206 --> 01:07:24,834
- $250.
- Make it $300.

1132
01:07:25,909 --> 01:07:27,706
You staying?

1133
01:07:31,014 --> 01:07:34,950
No, baby, I can't stay,

1134
01:07:35,018 --> 01:07:36,542
but I know you want me to,

1135
01:07:36,587 --> 01:07:38,214
but I can't.

1136
01:07:38,255 --> 01:07:40,780
Hey, hey! You holding up
the program, now, boy.

1137
01:07:40,824 --> 01:07:42,758
Come on, now,
and show your Uncle Tyrone

1138
01:07:42,793 --> 01:07:44,590
that dance you done for me
last week.

1139
01:07:44,628 --> 01:07:46,220
Come on, now.

1140
01:07:47,865 --> 01:07:50,493
Amir...

1141
01:07:50,534 --> 01:07:52,399
I know things
right now seem like

1142
01:07:52,436 --> 01:07:55,234
it don't make sense to you,
and you don't understand,

1143
01:07:55,272 --> 01:07:58,503
but I've been just where you are

1144
01:07:58,542 --> 01:08:00,703
and it ain't gonna be easy,

1145
01:08:00,744 --> 01:08:03,144
but it don't mean
you can't make it.

1146
01:08:05,349 --> 01:08:07,442
Come on, boy, I'm waiting now.

1147
01:08:14,892 --> 01:08:17,588
Come on, boy, do it.

1148
01:08:21,799 --> 01:08:23,460
That's my boy.

1149
01:08:27,905 --> 01:08:29,372
Who combs his hair?

1150
01:08:30,274 --> 01:08:31,741
What?

1151
01:08:31,775 --> 01:08:33,504
Who combs his hair?

1152
01:08:33,544 --> 01:08:34,909
Margaret.

1153
01:08:36,914 --> 01:08:38,279
Uh... we all do.

1154
01:08:38,315 --> 01:08:40,044
Who taught you how?

1155
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:42,017
Or did you read that in a book?

1156
01:08:44,888 --> 01:08:46,014
Our black pediatrician.

1157
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:49,581
So you know
an African-American.

1158
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:52,527
One with a professional degree.

1159
01:08:54,164 --> 01:08:55,688
Have you ever had
your black pediatrician

1160
01:08:55,732 --> 01:08:57,359
over to dinner, Mr. Lewin?

1161
01:08:59,503 --> 01:09:01,869
Do you have your pediatrician
over to dinner?

1162
01:09:01,905 --> 01:09:04,897
Answer my question, yes or no?

1163
01:09:06,109 --> 01:09:07,201
No.

1164
01:09:07,244 --> 01:09:09,439
When's the last time
you and your wife had dinner

1165
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:11,880
with anyone of color, Mr. Lewin?

1166
01:09:14,585 --> 01:09:16,314
Please answer

1167
01:09:16,353 --> 01:09:18,048
the question, Mr. Lewin.

1168
01:09:21,158 --> 01:09:23,422
I'm sorry, I can't remember
the last time.

1169
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:28,657
You love your wife, Mr. Lewin?

1170
01:09:28,699 --> 01:09:31,566
Oh, yes, very much.

1171
01:09:31,602 --> 01:09:32,660
How long you been married?

1172
01:09:32,703 --> 01:09:34,568
14 years.

1173
01:09:34,605 --> 01:09:35,936
And you love your daughter?

1174
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:38,337
- Of course.
- So this is a nice,

1175
01:09:38,375 --> 01:09:41,435
stable environment to bring
Isaiah into, wouldn't you say?

1176
01:09:41,478 --> 01:09:42,911
Yes, I would say.

1177
01:09:42,946 --> 01:09:44,811
Yes.

1178
01:09:46,517 --> 01:09:48,417
Who's Suzanna Polaski,
Mr. Lewin?

1179
01:09:50,387 --> 01:09:52,947
Uh, she's an architect
who works in my office.

1180
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:56,652
You having an affair
with Suzanna Polaski?

1181
01:10:01,365 --> 01:10:02,764
No.

1182
01:10:02,799 --> 01:10:04,096
No?

1183
01:10:04,134 --> 01:10:07,467
Be careful, Mr. Lewin,
you're under oath.

1184
01:10:07,504 --> 01:10:10,337
I'm not having an affair.

1185
01:10:11,808 --> 01:10:15,335
Have you ever had an affair
with Suzanna Polaski?

1186
01:10:15,379 --> 01:10:17,677
Yes or no?

1187
01:10:24,488 --> 01:10:26,683
Yes.

1188
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:29,715
I spent one evening with her.

1189
01:10:52,816 --> 01:10:54,909
I'm sorry.

1190
01:10:58,455 --> 01:11:01,947
What exactly are you sorry for?

1191
01:11:01,992 --> 01:11:04,961
That you threw your baby
in the trash?

1192
01:11:04,995 --> 01:11:08,123
That you dragged my family
through hell?

1193
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:12,191
No, I just want my son back.

1194
01:11:12,236 --> 01:11:15,672
Your son?

1195
01:11:15,706 --> 01:11:17,765
What makes him your son?

1196
01:11:17,808 --> 01:11:19,969
That you fucked some junkie
in an alley

1197
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:23,070
three years ago to get high?

1198
01:11:23,113 --> 01:11:24,478
Well, if you were
all of that,

1199
01:11:24,515 --> 01:11:26,745
your husband wouldn't have
fucked somebody else,

1200
01:11:26,784 --> 01:11:28,649
and maybe you'd have
a baby of your own,

1201
01:11:28,685 --> 01:11:30,152
and you wouldn't be trying

1202
01:11:30,187 --> 01:11:31,176
to take mine.

1203
01:11:31,221 --> 01:11:32,654
Look in the mirror.

1204
01:11:32,689 --> 01:11:33,815
Look at my face.

1205
01:11:33,857 --> 01:11:34,983
I'm his mother.

1206
01:11:35,025 --> 01:11:35,992
God says so.

1207
01:11:36,026 --> 01:11:36,993
Take yours?

1208
01:11:37,027 --> 01:11:38,995
I didn't have to take him.

1209
01:11:39,029 --> 01:11:40,656
You threw him away, remember?

1210
01:11:41,698 --> 01:11:43,222
Any animal can give birth.

1211
01:11:43,267 --> 01:11:45,394
That doesn't make it a mother.

1212
01:11:45,435 --> 01:11:47,665
Oh, so you calling me an animal?

1213
01:11:47,704 --> 01:11:49,001
If you think

1214
01:11:49,039 --> 01:11:50,529
you just gonna walk
up in this court

1215
01:11:50,574 --> 01:11:51,700
and take my baby

1216
01:11:51,742 --> 01:11:53,539
like you take some
puppy from a pound,

1217
01:11:53,577 --> 01:11:55,704
you got another
thing coming, lady,

1218
01:11:55,746 --> 01:11:58,715
'cause you ain't gonna
take my baby from me.

1219
01:11:58,749 --> 01:12:01,445
He's not a baby.

1220
01:12:01,485 --> 01:12:02,543
You don't even know him.

1221
01:12:02,586 --> 01:12:04,053
You don't know
anything about him.

1222
01:12:04,087 --> 01:12:05,452
Wait!

1223
01:12:05,489 --> 01:12:07,582
Don't do this.

1224
01:12:07,624 --> 01:12:10,092
Don't do this to Isaiah.

1225
01:12:11,662 --> 01:12:13,357
Don't do what?

1226
01:12:13,397 --> 01:12:14,523
Tell him the truth...

1227
01:12:14,565 --> 01:12:17,659
that his real mama is as black
as he is?

1228
01:12:17,701 --> 01:12:19,191
Black?

1229
01:12:19,236 --> 01:12:21,568
All you people
think about is color.

1230
01:12:21,605 --> 01:12:22,970
You people?

1231
01:12:23,006 --> 01:12:24,633
You people?

1232
01:12:24,675 --> 01:12:29,135
Well, me and Isaiah...
we the same kind of people...

1233
01:12:29,179 --> 01:12:32,546
or didn't you notice?

1234
01:12:50,634 --> 01:12:52,602
Margaret?

1235
01:12:52,636 --> 01:12:55,366
I'm not going to talk
about this right now.

1236
01:13:26,403 --> 01:13:27,734
Hi, honey.

1237
01:13:27,771 --> 01:13:29,762
Hi, Mom.

1238
01:13:32,009 --> 01:13:33,169
Mom?

1239
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:35,838
Hmm?

1240
01:13:35,879 --> 01:13:37,904
Are they going to take Isaiah?

1241
01:13:37,948 --> 01:13:40,246
Are you going to be okay?

1242
01:13:40,284 --> 01:13:42,252
Oh, honey.

1243
01:13:48,725 --> 01:13:49,885
I love you, Mommy.

1244
01:13:49,927 --> 01:13:52,293
Oh, Hannah, Hannah,

1245
01:13:52,329 --> 01:13:54,422
Hannah, Hannah.

1246
01:13:54,464 --> 01:13:57,126
There's never been
anybody like you.

1247
01:14:48,018 --> 01:14:49,610
Is this policy

1248
01:14:49,653 --> 01:14:51,814
unique to your agency?

1249
01:14:51,855 --> 01:14:52,981
No.

1250
01:14:53,023 --> 01:14:55,355
Most if not all
agencies prefer

1251
01:14:55,392 --> 01:14:59,522
to place a child with a family
of the same racial background.

1252
01:14:59,563 --> 01:15:01,531
Hmm.

1253
01:15:01,565 --> 01:15:04,932
Given the facts in this case
as you understand them,

1254
01:15:04,968 --> 01:15:07,937
what would be
your recommendation?

1255
01:15:07,971 --> 01:15:10,872
That the child
should be returned

1256
01:15:10,907 --> 01:15:12,067
to his birth mother.

1257
01:15:12,109 --> 01:15:14,168
Thank you.

1258
01:15:14,211 --> 01:15:16,202
No further questions.

1259
01:15:19,516 --> 01:15:20,949
Dr. Goldfein, you've stated

1260
01:15:20,984 --> 01:15:22,952
that your organization
is opposed

1261
01:15:22,986 --> 01:15:24,851
to interracial adoptions.

1262
01:15:24,888 --> 01:15:26,947
Does that mean you never
place black infants

1263
01:15:26,990 --> 01:15:28,924
with white couples?

1264
01:15:28,959 --> 01:15:32,952
Oh, no. We do this all the time,
but these are temporary.

1265
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:36,261
These children stay temporarily
in the white home

1266
01:15:36,299 --> 01:15:39,063
until a suitable black family
comes along?

1267
01:15:39,102 --> 01:15:40,262
That's right.

1268
01:15:40,303 --> 01:15:41,702
How long does that take?

1269
01:15:41,738 --> 01:15:43,706
It can take years.

1270
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:45,173
And the child is then

1271
01:15:45,208 --> 01:15:49,372
wrenched from the only family
they've ever known...

1272
01:15:49,413 --> 01:15:53,975
and turned over to strangers
because of the color

1273
01:15:54,051 --> 01:15:55,541
of their skin?

1274
01:15:55,585 --> 01:15:58,918
It's the long-term
interest of the child

1275
01:15:58,955 --> 01:16:00,718
we are trying to protect.

1276
01:16:00,757 --> 01:16:01,883
Well, wouldn't
you say

1277
01:16:01,925 --> 01:16:03,825
you were putting
political policy

1278
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:06,522
above the emotional
health of these children?

1279
01:16:06,563 --> 01:16:07,928
No.

1280
01:16:07,964 --> 01:16:09,932
All things being equal,

1281
01:16:09,966 --> 01:16:12,935
the black child is better off
with black parents.

1282
01:16:13,036 --> 01:16:15,027
All things being equal.

1283
01:16:15,072 --> 01:16:17,199
Well, what if all things
are not equal?

1284
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:21,506
Miss Jones, I am sick and tired

1285
01:16:21,545 --> 01:16:23,274
of the attitude that says

1286
01:16:23,313 --> 01:16:25,440
that taking poor
black children out

1287
01:16:25,482 --> 01:16:27,677
of their environment
and placing them

1288
01:16:27,717 --> 01:16:29,207
in an affluent household

1289
01:16:29,252 --> 01:16:32,278
is better for the child.

1290
01:16:32,322 --> 01:16:35,314
What kind of values
does that suggest?

1291
01:16:37,394 --> 01:16:39,624
- How much time do you got?
- Not much.

1292
01:16:39,663 --> 01:16:40,789
How about lunch?

1293
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:41,957
No.

1294
01:16:41,998 --> 01:16:43,226
Look, no strings
or nothing.

1295
01:16:43,266 --> 01:16:44,358
Would you leave me alone?

1296
01:16:44,401 --> 01:16:45,663
I can't give them nothing

1297
01:16:45,702 --> 01:16:48,068
to use against me in there,
or I'll lose my boy.

1298
01:16:48,105 --> 01:16:49,265
I don't want to do nothing

1299
01:16:49,306 --> 01:16:50,568
to hurt your chances.

1300
01:16:50,607 --> 01:16:52,131
Why didn't you
answer my letters?

1301
01:16:52,175 --> 01:16:54,234
'Cause I didn't open them.

1302
01:16:54,277 --> 01:16:55,972
I cannot talk to you.

1303
01:16:56,012 --> 01:16:58,003
I want you to know something.

1304
01:16:59,015 --> 01:17:00,607
I filed for a divorce...

1305
01:17:00,650 --> 01:17:03,414
and I'm coming back
when I get it.

1306
01:17:05,122 --> 01:17:08,785
Okay, I just wanted to say that.

1307
01:17:13,296 --> 01:17:15,355
You said it.

1308
01:17:16,533 --> 01:17:18,797
Mrs. Lewin,

1309
01:17:18,835 --> 01:17:20,029
does Isaiah play with dolls?

1310
01:17:20,070 --> 01:17:21,196
Sometimes.

1311
01:17:21,238 --> 01:17:23,331
Any of them black?

1312
01:17:24,975 --> 01:17:26,442
Yes.

1313
01:17:26,476 --> 01:17:29,673
And some of them are green,
and some of them are purple,

1314
01:17:29,713 --> 01:17:30,771
and some of them are orange.

1315
01:17:30,814 --> 01:17:31,781
It doesn't seem

1316
01:17:31,815 --> 01:17:32,782
to matter to him.

1317
01:17:32,816 --> 01:17:33,942
He plays with all of them.

1318
01:17:33,984 --> 01:17:35,144
As you know, Mrs. Lewin,

1319
01:17:35,185 --> 01:17:38,882
people don't have green
or purple or orange faces.

1320
01:17:41,892 --> 01:17:43,860
When you and Isaiah read
together,

1321
01:17:43,894 --> 01:17:46,954
do any of the books you read
have African-American characters

1322
01:17:46,997 --> 01:17:49,522
or pertain to African-American
history or culture?

1323
01:17:49,566 --> 01:17:53,593
We read Isaiah all sorts
of books in our home.

1324
01:17:53,637 --> 01:17:55,605
Oh, I'm sure you do,

1325
01:17:55,639 --> 01:17:58,802
but is there a black face
in any of them?

1326
01:17:58,842 --> 01:18:00,673
For instance,

1327
01:18:00,710 --> 01:18:02,439
have you read
<i>The Planet of Junior Brown,</i>

1328
01:18:02,479 --> 01:18:03,503
or <i>The People Could Fly,</i>

1329
01:18:03,547 --> 01:18:05,344
or <i>Many Thousand Gone</i>
by Virginia Hamilton?

1330
01:18:05,382 --> 01:18:06,747
Not yet.

1331
01:18:06,783 --> 01:18:08,910
Well, how about <i>The Red</i>
<i>Dancing Shoes</i> by Denise Patrick

1332
01:18:09,019 --> 01:18:11,180
or Faith Ringgold's <i>Aunt</i>
<i>Harriet's Underground Railroad</i>

1333
01:18:11,221 --> 01:18:12,483
<i>in the Sky?</i>

1334
01:18:12,522 --> 01:18:13,682
Not yet.

1335
01:18:13,723 --> 01:18:16,817
Or maybe your husband
has read him <i>Fathers and Sons,</i>

1336
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:19,920
or <i>Uncle Jed's Barbershop</i>
by Margeree King Mitchell.

1337
01:18:19,963 --> 01:18:21,954
No, I don't think so.

1338
01:18:23,533 --> 01:18:27,333
Well, who do you think
he identifies with, Mrs. Lewin?

1339
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:30,237
The orange-faced muppet?

1340
01:18:30,273 --> 01:18:33,470
Does he share
its muppet history?

1341
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:36,411
You ever stop to think
how Isaiah must feel

1342
01:18:36,446 --> 01:18:37,606
living in a world

1343
01:18:37,647 --> 01:18:40,343
where he never sees
anyone like himself?

1344
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:43,944
Might be kind of troubling,
don't you think?

1345
01:18:43,987 --> 01:18:46,319
Well, what's your point,
Mr. Lewis?

1346
01:18:46,356 --> 01:18:49,450
That our skin isn't
the right color?

1347
01:18:51,461 --> 01:18:53,952
That we're incapable
of teaching this child

1348
01:18:53,997 --> 01:18:55,965
what he needs to learn?

1349
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:59,457
That I can't raise Isaiah up
to be an honorable man

1350
01:18:59,502 --> 01:19:01,527
because my skin is white?

1351
01:19:05,609 --> 01:19:07,577
What about love?

1352
01:19:09,379 --> 01:19:12,610
You haven't even spoken
that word here.

1353
01:19:12,649 --> 01:19:14,776
Or doesn't that fit
into your equation

1354
01:19:14,818 --> 01:19:17,184
of black and white?

1355
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:19,484
And what about Isaiah?

1356
01:19:19,522 --> 01:19:22,685
How does he fit
into all of this?

1357
01:19:22,726 --> 01:19:25,718
Or is it more important
that we be

1358
01:19:25,762 --> 01:19:27,957
politically correct?

1359
01:19:39,476 --> 01:19:42,377
What we should be thinking
about here...

1360
01:19:44,147 --> 01:19:47,116
is what is going to happen...

1361
01:19:47,150 --> 01:19:50,085
to the spirit
of this little boy...

1362
01:19:53,456 --> 01:19:55,583
if he's...

1363
01:19:55,625 --> 01:19:58,287
taken away from us.

1364
01:19:58,328 --> 01:20:00,387
So, what you're saying is,

1365
01:20:00,430 --> 01:20:03,228
you're his only hope.

1366
01:20:05,669 --> 01:20:07,637
What I'm saying is,

1367
01:20:07,671 --> 01:20:10,196
we are all he knows,

1368
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:14,108
and if you take him away
from us, it'll kill him.

1369
01:20:15,578 --> 01:20:17,603
Oh.

1370
01:20:19,616 --> 01:20:22,244
So only you can save him.

1371
01:20:24,254 --> 01:20:26,279
You're the great white hope.

1372
01:20:28,658 --> 01:20:30,717
No.

1373
01:20:32,729 --> 01:20:35,197
But I am his mother.

1374
01:20:35,231 --> 01:20:38,496
Are you?

1375
01:21:15,505 --> 01:21:17,700
Shit.

1376
01:21:36,359 --> 01:21:38,486
Thank you.

1377
01:21:39,529 --> 01:21:41,861
You're welcome.

1378
01:22:11,761 --> 01:22:12,921
Higher, higher up. Faster.

1379
01:22:12,962 --> 01:22:16,227
Vroom, vroom!

1380
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:17,960
- Vroom!
- I'm going to tickle you.

1381
01:22:18,033 --> 01:22:19,398
I'm going to tickle you!

1382
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:22,370
BI-bl-bl-bleah!

1383
01:22:22,404 --> 01:22:24,770
Make it go really high.

1384
01:22:24,807 --> 01:22:26,274
Mom, is that you?

1385
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:27,969
Hi, honey.

1386
01:22:28,010 --> 01:22:30,240
Mommy, Mommy!

1387
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:31,769
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!

1388
01:22:31,814 --> 01:22:32,781
Mommy!

1389
01:22:32,815 --> 01:22:35,579
Oh... there's my boy!

1390
01:22:35,618 --> 01:22:37,711
There's my boy.

1391
01:22:37,753 --> 01:22:40,221
Oh, little boy-o.

1392
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:43,987
Mmm...

1393
01:22:44,059 --> 01:22:45,390
Mommy!

1394
01:22:45,427 --> 01:22:47,156
See you later, Mom.

1395
01:22:50,266 --> 01:22:51,927
Gonna tickle you!

1396
01:22:53,536 --> 01:22:55,060
Gotcha.

1397
01:23:08,918 --> 01:23:10,215
Hello?

1398
01:23:10,252 --> 01:23:11,947
Khaila, the judge has asked us

1399
01:23:12,054 --> 01:23:13,419
to be at the court at 11:00.

1400
01:23:13,455 --> 01:23:15,320
Okay. Bye.

1401
01:23:28,404 --> 01:23:30,338
All rise.

1402
01:23:30,372 --> 01:23:32,966
This branch of the Circuit Court
of Cook County

1403
01:23:33,075 --> 01:23:34,133
is now in session,

1404
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:36,576
the Honorable Renata Silbowitz
presiding.

1405
01:23:36,612 --> 01:23:37,601
Be seated.

1406
01:23:41,450 --> 01:23:45,250
This was not an easy decision.

1407
01:23:46,822 --> 01:23:49,950
I have decided to return
the child, Isaiah,

1408
01:23:49,992 --> 01:23:51,857
to his biological mother.

1409
01:23:51,894 --> 01:23:53,987
When the mother is capable...

1410
01:23:54,063 --> 01:23:58,124
and I believe Miss Richards
is functioning well enough

1411
01:23:58,167 --> 01:23:59,862
to parent this child...

1412
01:23:59,902 --> 01:24:02,302
it is usually
in the child's best interest

1413
01:24:02,338 --> 01:24:04,101
to be with his natural mother,

1414
01:24:04,139 --> 01:24:08,269
especially when there
is a racial issue involved.

1415
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:11,711
This may cause
some initial trauma,

1416
01:24:11,747 --> 01:24:13,146
but Isaiah is young...

1417
01:24:13,182 --> 01:24:14,547
We're just going
to take him away.

1418
01:24:14,583 --> 01:24:16,210
...and should be able
to deal with this...

1419
01:24:16,252 --> 01:24:17,651
Out of the state,
out of the country.

1420
01:24:17,686 --> 01:24:19,677
...if the adults conduct
themselves thoughtfully.

1421
01:24:19,722 --> 01:24:22,555
- No.
- Oh, why not?

1422
01:24:22,591 --> 01:24:25,219
Our jobs can move.

1423
01:24:25,261 --> 01:24:26,819
We'll go to California.

1424
01:24:26,862 --> 01:24:28,762
You always wanted
to go there.

1425
01:24:28,797 --> 01:24:30,890
No, Charles.

1426
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:35,866
Well, we're going
to appeal.

1427
01:24:35,905 --> 01:24:37,338
No!

1428
01:24:42,811 --> 01:24:45,143
It's over!

1429
01:25:13,442 --> 01:25:14,932
What you doing?

1430
01:25:15,044 --> 01:25:16,944
I said, "Nothing."

1431
01:25:16,979 --> 01:25:19,209
You a dinosaur?

1432
01:25:19,248 --> 01:25:20,875
I'm coming.

1433
01:25:20,916 --> 01:25:22,907
What you doing?

1434
01:25:22,952 --> 01:25:23,941
Nothing.

1435
01:25:24,053 --> 01:25:26,214
Isaiah?

1436
01:25:26,255 --> 01:25:28,052
Come on, honey, it's time to go.

1437
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:31,526
Let's get your jacket on, okay?

1438
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:35,360
You're going to see
Khaila now... remember?

1439
01:25:35,397 --> 01:25:37,865
I told you about her.

1440
01:25:40,703 --> 01:25:43,763
You're going to live
with her, Isaiah.

1441
01:25:43,806 --> 01:25:45,967
And then I'm coming back.

1442
01:25:46,008 --> 01:25:47,908
No, honey, you're
not coming back.

1443
01:25:47,943 --> 01:25:49,308
I coming back.

1444
01:25:49,345 --> 01:25:50,812
No, Isaiah, wait, wait!

1445
01:25:50,846 --> 01:25:52,143
Wait a minute.

1446
01:26:02,057 --> 01:26:03,786
Here.

1447
01:26:03,826 --> 01:26:05,726
Look.

1448
01:26:05,761 --> 01:26:07,956
This is Mama's.

1449
01:26:10,866 --> 01:26:12,925
I want you to keep it, okay?

1450
01:26:13,002 --> 01:26:14,833
No matter what happens.

1451
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:19,830
I want you to know that
we're always together...

1452
01:26:19,875 --> 01:26:22,673
that I'm always with you...

1453
01:26:22,711 --> 01:26:25,077
inside you, in here...

1454
01:26:25,114 --> 01:26:29,073
just like you're
always with me...

1455
01:26:29,118 --> 01:26:31,951
in here, all right?

1456
01:26:31,987 --> 01:26:34,114
And nobody...

1457
01:26:35,991 --> 01:26:39,358
can ever change that.

1458
01:26:43,365 --> 01:26:47,131
You promise you won't forget?

1459
01:27:02,518 --> 01:27:03,917
Hey, kiddo.

1460
01:27:04,019 --> 01:27:06,817
Hannah?

1461
01:27:09,358 --> 01:27:10,188
Kiddo?

1462
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:12,386
Isaiah.

1463
01:27:12,428 --> 01:27:13,486
Isaiah, this is the lady

1464
01:27:13,529 --> 01:27:15,759
that's going to take you
to Khaila's house, okay?

1465
01:27:15,798 --> 01:27:17,493
Hi, Isaiah, you want
to come with me?

1466
01:27:17,533 --> 01:27:19,194
It's going to be all right,
Isaiah.

1467
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:20,599
Let me just take
him, all right?

1468
01:27:20,636 --> 01:27:21,796
I swear it'll be all right.

1469
01:27:21,837 --> 01:27:23,566
- It's going to be all right.
- No.

1470
01:27:23,605 --> 01:27:24,902
Why don't you just
let me take him?

1471
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:26,737
It'll be better,
and you'll get used to it.

1472
01:27:26,775 --> 01:27:29,335
Why don't you just let me
take him, Mrs. Lewin, okay?

1473
01:27:29,378 --> 01:27:30,709
I promise you
it'll be all right.

1474
01:27:30,746 --> 01:27:31,713
- Let me just take him.
- No!

1475
01:27:31,747 --> 01:27:33,510
Mr. Lewin, this isn't helping.

1476
01:27:33,549 --> 01:27:34,641
And you are?!

1477
01:27:34,683 --> 01:27:36,207
Let me have him.

1478
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:38,310
- Just a minute.
- Mommy!

1479
01:27:38,353 --> 01:27:40,844
Just a minute!
Just a minute!

1480
01:27:40,889 --> 01:27:42,049
Just a minute!

1481
01:27:42,091 --> 01:27:44,582
Well, what about his things?

1482
01:27:44,626 --> 01:27:46,116
They're not his things now.

1483
01:27:46,161 --> 01:27:50,257
Tell her he has to have
a light on to sleep.

1484
01:29:23,792 --> 01:29:26,260
Hi, Isaiah.

1485
01:29:26,295 --> 01:29:29,696
You scared? Don't be scared.

1486
01:29:29,731 --> 01:29:33,929
I'm your mama...
and I ain't gonna hurt you.

1487
01:29:34,036 --> 01:29:37,267
I know what it's like
to be scared.

1488
01:29:37,306 --> 01:29:41,106
That's why I'm gonna give you
all the time you need.

1489
01:29:41,143 --> 01:29:43,077
All the time in the world.

1490
01:29:43,111 --> 01:29:46,205
This is where
you gonna live, you and me.

1491
01:29:46,248 --> 01:29:50,878
I fixed this whole place up
just for you.

1492
01:29:50,919 --> 01:29:53,786
And your toys that
you brought with you

1493
01:29:53,822 --> 01:29:55,983
are right over there in a box.

1494
01:29:59,461 --> 01:30:01,486
That your boy?

1495
01:30:01,530 --> 01:30:04,624
Yeah.

1496
01:30:04,666 --> 01:30:06,634
What's his name?

1497
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:11,568
Isaiah.

1498
01:30:11,607 --> 01:30:13,268
Hey, Isaiah.

1499
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:20,480
He's deaf.

1500
01:30:20,515 --> 01:30:22,983
Nah, he ain't deaf.

1501
01:30:23,051 --> 01:30:25,713
Just a little tired right now.

1502
01:30:25,754 --> 01:30:27,483
Come back tomorrow.

1503
01:30:27,522 --> 01:30:30,320
He'll play with you then.

1504
01:30:31,393 --> 01:30:33,759
Something's wrong with him.

1505
01:30:47,476 --> 01:30:49,944
Hi. Who's this?

1506
01:30:49,978 --> 01:30:51,275
Isaiah.

1507
01:30:51,313 --> 01:30:52,507
Oh, hi.

1508
01:30:59,488 --> 01:31:00,648
You know where class 3B is?

1509
01:31:00,689 --> 01:31:02,213
I think...
Do you know where 3B is?

1510
01:31:02,257 --> 01:31:04,191
Up the stairs and to your left.

1511
01:31:04,226 --> 01:31:06,057
So, you're new here, huh?

1512
01:31:06,094 --> 01:31:07,356
Yep. First day.

1513
01:31:07,396 --> 01:31:09,057
Welcome.

1514
01:31:16,571 --> 01:31:18,562
Come on, sweetie,
don't be slow.

1515
01:31:18,607 --> 01:31:19,733
Come on.

1516
01:31:22,878 --> 01:31:26,370
Everyone pick up a piece
of paper when you come in.

1517
01:31:33,955 --> 01:31:35,217
Okay, I got to go to work,

1518
01:31:35,257 --> 01:31:36,952
so I'm gonna leave
you here, okay?

1519
01:31:36,992 --> 01:31:39,620
Now, all these kids here,
you can play with them...

1520
01:31:39,661 --> 01:31:41,492
and have fun, okay?

1521
01:31:41,530 --> 01:31:44,363
I'll be back
to get you later.

1522
01:31:44,399 --> 01:31:45,889
Go on and play.

1523
01:31:47,436 --> 01:31:49,461
Bye-bye.

1524
01:32:07,556 --> 01:32:09,786
Leave it there.

1525
01:32:18,633 --> 01:32:20,624
Okay.

1526
01:32:24,072 --> 01:32:26,131
Yeah, let's just
leave everything

1527
01:32:26,174 --> 01:32:28,233
exactly the way it
is, shall we?

1528
01:32:29,611 --> 01:32:33,138
You can just sit right
there, and I'll, uh...

1529
01:32:33,181 --> 01:32:35,911
I'll sit...

1530
01:32:35,951 --> 01:32:39,079
right here.

1531
01:32:39,121 --> 01:32:41,453
And Hannah can lock herself
in her room,

1532
01:32:41,490 --> 01:32:44,516
and we don't ever have
to talk to her again, do we?

1533
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:46,720
Remember her? Hannah?
Your daughter!?

1534
01:32:46,762 --> 01:32:48,161
Let go of me.

1535
01:32:48,196 --> 01:32:49,959
I'm not going to,
Margaret. I can't.

1536
01:32:49,998 --> 01:32:53,297
- Get out of my way!
- Margaret,

1537
01:32:53,335 --> 01:32:54,927
what happened here
is as bad as it gets,

1538
01:32:54,970 --> 01:32:55,994
but you got to get over it.

1539
01:32:56,104 --> 01:32:58,572
"Get over it"?

1540
01:32:58,607 --> 01:32:59,767
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

1541
01:32:59,808 --> 01:33:00,900
Oh, I forgot, we're supposed

1542
01:33:00,942 --> 01:33:02,170
to feel sorry
for poor Margaret

1543
01:33:02,210 --> 01:33:03,700
because she lives
in an unjust world,

1544
01:33:03,745 --> 01:33:05,508
and she's just going
to have to live there.

1545
01:33:05,547 --> 01:33:06,571
Hmm? What's the matter?

1546
01:33:06,615 --> 01:33:08,412
Can't you fix
this one, Maggie?

1547
01:33:08,450 --> 01:33:09,815
You son of a bitch!

1548
01:33:12,854 --> 01:33:17,484
No! No! No, no!

1549
01:33:17,526 --> 01:33:22,896
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

1550
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:24,228
Margaret,

1551
01:33:24,266 --> 01:33:26,564
Margaret, maybe he's better off
where he is.

1552
01:33:26,601 --> 01:33:29,832
Maybe, just maybe,
that lawyer was right.

1553
01:33:32,374 --> 01:33:34,501
I know he isn't ours.

1554
01:33:34,543 --> 01:33:35,942
I just...

1555
01:33:35,977 --> 01:33:40,914
didn't know
I'd miss him this much.

1556
01:33:46,087 --> 01:33:48,851
Neither did I.

1557
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:55,161
I didn't know.

1558
01:34:04,306 --> 01:34:06,866
Thought you might
like to read to him.

1559
01:34:06,908 --> 01:34:10,901
He don't even talk to me.

1560
01:34:11,947 --> 01:34:14,142
It's only been two weeks.

1561
01:34:14,182 --> 01:34:18,278
It's a tough thing for a child
to understand all at once.

1562
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:19,617
He'll come around.

1563
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:22,145
And if he don't?

1564
01:34:23,859 --> 01:34:26,555
It happened to me.

1565
01:34:26,595 --> 01:34:29,758
I remember I used to sit
under a chair

1566
01:34:29,798 --> 01:34:33,097
when they used
to come try to get me...

1567
01:34:33,134 --> 01:34:35,932
take me from one
foster place to another.

1568
01:34:38,039 --> 01:34:40,837
I know what it's like...

1569
01:34:40,876 --> 01:34:44,073
to want to get
inside yourself...

1570
01:34:44,112 --> 01:34:47,570
and just disappear.

1571
01:34:47,616 --> 01:34:50,084
But you didn't.

1572
01:34:52,220 --> 01:34:56,486
Okay, got you a hamburger
and some French fries.

1573
01:34:56,525 --> 01:34:58,823
Look, they gave you
a car. Look.

1574
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:01,420
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom.

1575
01:35:03,465 --> 01:35:04,762
Okay. Want a French fry?

1576
01:35:04,799 --> 01:35:06,767
Here, try a French fry.
Go ahead.

1577
01:35:06,801 --> 01:35:07,927
Okay, wait a minute.

1578
01:35:08,036 --> 01:35:09,901
Here, here, try another one.

1579
01:35:09,938 --> 01:35:11,599
Come on, it's good.

1580
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:12,766
Come on, Isaiah, please?

1581
01:35:12,807 --> 01:35:13,933
Come on, look,

1582
01:35:14,042 --> 01:35:15,566
now you going to have
to eat something,

1583
01:35:15,610 --> 01:35:17,601
'cause if you don't eat,
you're going to get sick.

1584
01:35:17,646 --> 01:35:19,170
Now, look-look at Mama,
I'm gonna eat.

1585
01:35:19,214 --> 01:35:21,546
Mmm, good. Good.

1586
01:35:21,583 --> 01:35:23,210
Come on, try your hamburger.

1587
01:35:23,251 --> 01:35:24,616
- Isaiah.
- No. No.

1588
01:35:24,653 --> 01:35:26,518
Take a bite of your hamburger.

1589
01:35:26,555 --> 01:35:27,954
- No. No!
- Come on, please?

1590
01:35:27,989 --> 01:35:28,956
- Isaiah.
- No, go away!

1591
01:35:28,990 --> 01:35:29,957
Isaiah!

1592
01:35:29,991 --> 01:35:31,219
Please, come on, turn around.

1593
01:35:31,259 --> 01:35:32,487
- No, no, no, no.
- Eat the hamburger.

1594
01:35:32,527 --> 01:35:33,459
Come on, please?

1595
01:35:33,495 --> 01:35:34,962
Isaiah, eat the...

1596
01:35:35,063 --> 01:35:36,121
Ouch!

1597
01:35:36,164 --> 01:35:38,632
I want my mommy!

1598
01:35:38,667 --> 01:35:39,964
Isaiah! Isaiah, no!

1599
01:35:40,035 --> 01:35:41,127
I want my mommy!

1600
01:35:41,169 --> 01:35:42,500
Isaiah, not the chair.
No, Isaiah!

1601
01:35:42,537 --> 01:35:43,799
Please, Isaiah, come here.

1602
01:35:43,838 --> 01:35:45,032
Isaiah, no!

1603
01:35:49,010 --> 01:35:51,137
Oh, don't do this.

1604
01:35:51,179 --> 01:35:52,976
Don't do this.

1605
01:35:53,014 --> 01:35:56,313
No. Don't do this.

1606
01:36:03,959 --> 01:36:06,587
Isaiah.

1607
01:36:06,629 --> 01:36:08,119
Isaiah?

1608
01:36:09,131 --> 01:36:13,591
Isaiah! Isaiah!

1609
01:36:13,636 --> 01:36:15,763
Stop playing games!

1610
01:36:15,804 --> 01:36:16,930
Isaiah!

1611
01:36:16,972 --> 01:36:17,939
Shit.

1612
01:36:17,973 --> 01:36:21,773
Isaiah! Isaiah!

1613
01:36:21,810 --> 01:36:23,778
Isaiah!

1614
01:36:23,812 --> 01:36:26,110
Shit. Isaiah!

1615
01:36:26,148 --> 01:36:28,139
Isaiah!

1616
01:36:29,485 --> 01:36:31,282
Isaiah!

1617
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:34,289
Isaiah, are you in here?

1618
01:36:34,323 --> 01:36:37,486
Isaiah! Isaiah!

1619
01:36:42,998 --> 01:36:44,795
Isaiah!

1620
01:36:58,847 --> 01:37:01,338
Okay.

1621
01:38:00,175 --> 01:38:01,836
Hannah.

1622
01:38:02,945 --> 01:38:04,913
Why do I always have
to get the phone?

1623
01:38:04,947 --> 01:38:07,939
'Cause it's always for you.

1624
01:38:12,621 --> 01:38:14,612
Hello.

1625
01:38:16,458 --> 01:38:18,392
Mom.

1626
01:38:56,064 --> 01:38:58,123
Thank you for coming.

1627
01:38:58,167 --> 01:38:59,634
Is he all right?

1628
01:38:59,668 --> 01:39:01,659
No.

1629
01:39:07,643 --> 01:39:11,079
I guess I just wanted him so bad
that I wasn't thinking.

1630
01:39:11,113 --> 01:39:13,172
Maybe I was just hoping.

1631
01:39:15,484 --> 01:39:18,681
I wanted him to know who he was
and where he came from,

1632
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:20,654
and that I never
would've given him up

1633
01:39:20,689 --> 01:39:23,419
if I'd have been clean and
hadn't been all messed up,

1634
01:39:23,459 --> 01:39:26,087
and that I was going to
always be there for him.

1635
01:39:26,128 --> 01:39:28,596
And I want him to stay
in school, right here,

1636
01:39:28,630 --> 01:39:30,291
with these kids just like him.

1637
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:33,063
Khaila, what are you talking
about?

1638
01:39:34,102 --> 01:39:35,865
I want you to go in there,

1639
01:39:35,904 --> 01:39:38,805
and hold him till he
ain't scared no more.

1640
01:39:40,309 --> 01:39:42,607
I'm not saying I'm
giving him back to you.

1641
01:39:42,644 --> 01:39:43,804
I'm just saying he's going

1642
01:39:43,846 --> 01:39:45,677
to come live with you
for a little while

1643
01:39:45,714 --> 01:39:47,238
till he can understand
all this.

1644
01:39:47,282 --> 01:39:48,909
Now, some people
are going to think

1645
01:39:48,951 --> 01:39:50,509
that I'm crazy,
but I don't care.

1646
01:39:50,552 --> 01:39:52,110
All that matters
to me is Isaiah.

1647
01:39:52,154 --> 01:39:53,621
And you may not like me,

1648
01:39:53,655 --> 01:39:55,384
but you're going to
have to deal with me.

1649
01:39:55,424 --> 01:39:58,450
I'm doing this
because I love him.

1650
01:39:58,494 --> 01:40:01,156
I really, really love him.

1651
01:40:03,198 --> 01:40:05,962
I love him, too.

1652
01:40:23,719 --> 01:40:26,085
Isaiah?

1653
01:40:35,364 --> 01:40:38,663
- Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!
- Oh, Isaiah!

1654
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:40,361
Mommy! Mommy!

1655
01:40:40,402 --> 01:40:41,664
Mommy!

1656
01:40:41,703 --> 01:40:42,829
Oh, my boy!

1657
01:40:42,871 --> 01:40:44,998
Oh, Isaiah!

1658
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:46,507
Oh...

1659
01:40:46,542 --> 01:40:49,204
Oh, I've missed you,
I've missed you.

1660
01:40:50,212 --> 01:40:52,373
Mommy.

1661
01:40:56,218 --> 01:40:57,685
Thank you.

1662
01:41:05,494 --> 01:41:09,328
Isaiah, this is a nice
school you have here, hmm?

1663
01:41:10,666 --> 01:41:13,328
Can you show me and Khaila
what you like to do?

1664
01:41:14,336 --> 01:41:15,462
Huh?

1665
01:41:15,504 --> 01:41:18,132
He likes to play with blocks.

1666
01:41:18,173 --> 01:41:20,733
Do you want to play
with some blocks?

1667
01:41:21,777 --> 01:41:23,642
Do you want to build something?

1668
01:41:23,679 --> 01:41:26,307
Oh, look.
Khaila's got the blocks.

1669
01:41:26,348 --> 01:41:28,339
Show me, Isaiah.

1670
01:41:33,855 --> 01:41:36,653
Put that... oop...
put that big one there.

1671
01:41:36,692 --> 01:41:38,990
A house?

1672
01:41:39,027 --> 01:41:41,325
Is that a house?

1673
01:41:41,363 --> 01:41:43,160
Which house
is Khaila's house?

1674
01:41:43,198 --> 01:41:46,497
This one and this is yours.

1675
01:41:46,535 --> 01:41:48,833
Isaiah's tower.

1676
01:41:48,870 --> 01:41:51,168
You can have that room
at the very top, huh?

1677
01:41:51,206 --> 01:41:54,175
All right.

1678
01:41:55,175 --> 01:42:05,175
