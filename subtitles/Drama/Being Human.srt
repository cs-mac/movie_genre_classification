00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,547
[female voice]
This...is the story of a story.

2
00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:51,652
Once upon a time,
there was this...

3
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:52,786
story,

4
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,789
and the story
said to itself,

5
00:00:55,823 --> 00:00:58,159
"How shall I begin?"

6
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:01,662
[male voice]
Try the usual way.

7
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:03,264
What, in the dark?

8
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:05,266
With a man and a woman

9
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:07,801
and a story that's
still to tell itself?

10
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:10,404
Well, you've got
to start somewhere.

11
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:13,541
Say, "Long, long ago"

12
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:16,810
or "Far, far away"

13
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:24,685
or just "Once".

14
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:26,687
That's good.

15
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,290
"Far away"
so you know the place

16
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:31,559
is close
to your own heart.

17
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,161
"Once" is nice,

18
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:35,296
so we know
it always happens.

19
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:36,430
Hmm.

20
00:01:36,464 --> 00:01:38,332
Once there was this...

21
00:01:38,366 --> 00:01:39,833
hero.

22
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:41,769
Some hero.

23
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:44,838
Some man, then.

24
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:46,707
Any man.

25
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,312
Say, a man, a woman,
and some children.

26
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:53,147
Don't forget the children.

27
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:57,451
What's he doing now?

28
00:01:57,485 --> 00:02:00,188
Still building the fire.

29
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:01,589
Hiding, you mean.

30
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,324
He's scared of us?

31
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:04,725
Some dad, huh?

32
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:06,327
Ha ha...

33
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,330
Well, it's been four years.

34
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:10,731
He's getting fat.

[giggling]

36
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:35,889
So what's in the story?

37
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,891
A man on a beach

38
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:39,360
all washed up.

39
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:40,361
A shipwreck.

40
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:41,495
A heartbreak.

41
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:42,496
Freedom?

42
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,898
Betrayal, regrets,

43
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:46,234
old shoes,

44
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:47,768
a crust of bread,

45
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:50,238
a bunch of roses.

46
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:52,240
Could be my story.

47
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:54,342
Anybody's story.

48
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:00,914
A journey.

49
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:03,784
A long, long journey.

50
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,419
Yeah. That's the story.

51
00:03:05,453 --> 00:03:09,257
A long, long journey to...

52
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,958
where, exactly?

53
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,542
[giggling]

54
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:32,680

Go on.

00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:46,994
[female voice]
Once upon another time...

57
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:52,966
so long ago, nobody
had got around to caring

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,570
whether the world
was round or flat...

59
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:59,573
there lived--in a cave--

60
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:03,010
a man, a woman,
and some children.

61
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:04,545

63
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,784

[sniffling]

66
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:28,436
Inside the cave,
it was as safe as...

67
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:29,470
houses.

68
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,876
And every day, they awoke

69
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,912
into the only world
they would ever know.

70
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:55,663
[children laughing]

71
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:13,514
Stay home.

72
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:15,383
Dada's hunting.

73
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,417
Go.

74
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:23,524

75
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:25,058
No.

Go home.

77
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:29,597
Go.

78
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:46,079
Maybe if the man knew
the whole story,

79
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:49,817
this very well
might have been different.

80
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,952
But this seemed
a morning...

81
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:53,721

Dada...

180
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:51,111
Dada...

181
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:52,712
Dada.

182
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,593
If the world is round...

183
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:43,330
you could still fall off the edge.

184
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:46,199
No. It's not round like that.

185
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,668
It's round like...

186
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:50,103
this.

187
00:17:50,137 --> 00:17:52,239
You believe everything
that Greek tells you?

188
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:53,840
Where are we, then?

189
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:55,808
Rome must be in the middle...

190
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:56,876
here.

191
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,879
So we must be out here...

192
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:00,480
somewhere.

193
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:02,115
Right. Another time,

194
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:03,516
there's this man,

195
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:07,120
and he had a woman
and a child and a bed,

196
00:18:07,154 --> 00:18:10,257
but it was not his bed...

197
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,260
not his child...

198
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,094
not his woman.

199
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:32,145
Everything he had,

200
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:34,281
even his smallest humiliation,

201
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:36,583
belonged to his master.

202
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,729
[man]
All must stop, Lucinnius.

203
00:18:58,205 --> 00:19:01,174
No sign of the ships.

204
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,842
Bad omens, Hector.

205
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,411
Bad omens.

206
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,847
Everything's gone wrong
since the earthquake.

207
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,583
I knew that it was a sign.

208
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:13,186
The gods were trying
to tell me something.

209
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,722
I think the gods were
telling everybody something.

210
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:19,192
What could be worse
than to be a slave...

211
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:20,660
unless...

212
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:24,364
it's to be a slave
to a foolish master.

213
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:29,202
Bad omens, Hector.

214
00:19:29,236 --> 00:19:30,737
Not an omen, an accident.

215
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,205
It's a bad omen.

216
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:33,206
An accident.

217
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,607
Get me something to eat.

218
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:36,543
Spoiled his day,
meeting your old man.

219
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:39,612
Been avoiding him all week.

220
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:42,215
The big bit.

221
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:44,284
Not the big bit.

222
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:46,319
His ships have gone as well, we heard.

223
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:47,487
What have you heard?

224
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,755
Last night. Nepos knew.

225
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:49,756
Pirates.

226
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:51,224
They're sunk, he reckoned.

227
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:52,592
That could finish him, eh?

228
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,227
This is the worst it's been.

229
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:57,497
He'll be up for sale before
you know it. Ha ha...

230
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,499
Will he lend you the money?

231
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,234
He was honest about it.

232
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:02,969
He said so plain, simple,

233
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:04,237
No.

234
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:05,638
That's a problem.

235
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:07,507
He didn't want any rope?

236
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,608
No.

237
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:10,510
And the ships have gone. I know.

238
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:11,978
I told you?
No.

239
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,580
But you knew?
Yes.

240
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:15,382
Who told you?
Julian's men.

241
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:16,583
Who told them?

242
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:17,584
Nepos.

243
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:18,985
Then Cyprian knows already.

244
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:21,554
He'll want his money back, too.

245
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:25,992
You get a chicken and
fetch Hermas the diviner.

246
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,266
Are my ships from Sicily still afloat?

247
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,301
No, no.

248
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:35,802
Offer the grain first.

249
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:37,537
Sprinkle some on the altar.

250
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,672
Making another sacrifice, father?

251
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:41,774
Shh.
Leave us alone.

252
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:48,548
And we can't ask the gods
specific questions.

253
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:51,818
It's a gentle, probing inquiry.

254
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,553
General questions.

255
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,954
Well, let's see.

256
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:07,700
General answer--

257
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:09,302
No.

258
00:21:09,336 --> 00:21:10,570
What do you mean?

259
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,038
The liver says no.

260
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:13,640
Do it again.

261
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:16,309
I want you to do it again.

262
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:17,844
Is it the gods' will

263
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:19,579
that Cyprian...

264
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,714
be well-disposed towards me...

265
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:22,982
in the future?

266
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,518
Doing it again
means another chicken...

267
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:27,987
and another 15 sesterces.

268
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,023
I'll have my first 15 now, please.

269
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:38,331
And, uh, that's 2 for the chicken.

270
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:39,866
It was our chicken.

271
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:41,868
Oh, yes. Of course. Sorry.

272
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:44,371
It's all right.

273
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:48,007
Cyprian loaned me half a
million to fit out these ships.

274
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,609
I'm finished.

275
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,345
Just when things were going well.

276
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:54,747
I had plans for you, too, Hector.

277
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:56,483
In four or five years,

278
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:58,485
I was going to make you free.

279
00:21:58,518 --> 00:22:00,753
You could've found your
family, brought them here,

280
00:22:00,787 --> 00:22:01,754
everything.

281
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:02,755
Sounds good.

282
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:04,957
It does, doesn't it?

283
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:08,027
I shouldn't give up.
I can't.

284
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,496
I'll visit Cyprian...

285
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:12,031
first thing tomorrow
before the others get to him.

286
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,900
He's got to see reason.

287
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:15,902
I can pay him back...

288
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:17,504
sometime.

289
00:22:17,537 --> 00:22:20,373
It's the only chance
we have, Hector.

290
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:21,641
Should I do it?

291
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:22,675
You must.

292
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,645
You're right.

293
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:26,713
I must.

294
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,116
Thalia,

295
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:32,519
I think I need one
of your massages.

296
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:35,688
Hector, you can finish the lamps.

297
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:45,698
Lower, Thalia.

298
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:48,801
Ahh...

299
00:22:48,835 --> 00:22:49,869
lower.

300
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:52,004
Ahh...

301
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:54,574
[snoring]

302
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,742
[thunder]

303
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:41,988
Why does the thunder
always stay out at sea?

304
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:45,024
It thundered like that before
the earthquake, remember?

305
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:54,734
If he goes down, I'm
asking for my freedom.

306
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,669
He owes it to me.

307
00:23:56,703 --> 00:23:59,138
And yours, too. We'd be free.

308
00:23:59,171 --> 00:23:59,972
Then what?

309
00:24:00,006 --> 00:24:03,142
What do you mean?
What we talk about.

310
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:05,144
We talk about going home.

311
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:07,013
Yours is that way...

312
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:08,615
mine is that way.

313
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:10,149
Your family's that way.

314
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:13,152
I made that up.
I don't know where they are.

315
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:16,489
We can't talk about families anymore.
It's been too long.

316
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:17,456
It's what you talk--

317
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,927
We talk about it
because it can never happen.

318
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:24,196
It's just you and me now.

319
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:27,166
Save your breath for
blowing in my ear.

320
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:32,004
I think you'll leave.

321
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:34,707
You are going to leave me here.

322
00:24:34,741 --> 00:24:35,742
Shh.

323
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,847
And, every morning,

324
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,115
the man awoke into the only world

325
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:44,717
he would ever know.

326
00:24:44,751 --> 00:24:47,119
I can't sleep.
Get me a chicken.

327
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:48,988
I want to make another sacrifice.

328
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:50,757
We'll do it ourselves.

329
00:24:55,762 --> 00:24:58,164
[rooster crows]

330
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:09,742
We'll be first, Hector.

331
00:25:09,776 --> 00:25:11,043
Definitely.

332
00:25:11,911 --> 00:25:13,880
No one else will be there.

333
00:25:13,913 --> 00:25:15,848
Not this early.

334
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:17,283
Were they friends?

335
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:20,286
Well, they were
as close to friends

336
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:22,955
as a master
and a slave can be.

337
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:23,890
I'm Cyprian--

338
00:25:23,923 --> 00:25:27,026
I mean, Lucinnius.
I've come to see Cyprian.

339
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,294
Do you have a gift?

340
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:29,896
A gift? No.

341
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:32,298
Join the line on the left.

342
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:33,766
Thank you.

343
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,635
Leave the stool.

344
00:26:20,146 --> 00:26:21,848
And as his master

345
00:26:21,881 --> 00:26:24,350
went in to meet
the master of his fate,

346
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:26,118
the slave was free,

347
00:26:26,152 --> 00:26:29,321
free to feel the sun
on his back

348
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:32,324
and squat in the dirt
amongst the litter carriers

349
00:26:32,358 --> 00:26:33,926
and chicken imitators.

350
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,665
Cock-a-doodle-dooo...

351
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:40,299
Bawk bawk bawk bawk...

352
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:02,955
You seem much happier.

353
00:27:02,989 --> 00:27:03,956
Relieved, anyway.

354
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,826
Relieved that it's over at last.

355
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:07,827
So...

356
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,095
He's going to help you?

357
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:11,698
I have to kill myself
by tomorrow morning.

358
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:13,700
He has my letters to Titanius.

359
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:16,102
None got through.
He says it's treason.

360
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:19,105
He says I should want to die.

361
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,707
I'm done for, Hector.

362
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,974
[man imitating chicken]

363
00:27:22,008 --> 00:27:22,975
It's strange.

364
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:26,245
I--I feel kind of good now.

365
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:28,114
The struggle is over.

366
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,849
Ha ha ha...

367
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:33,853
Ah, we've seen it
through together, eh?

368
00:27:33,886 --> 00:27:36,889
Let's get home.
We've a lot to do.

369
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:40,259
Tonight...

370
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:42,294
peace at last.

371
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:47,299
I don't feel so good
about it now.

372
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,268
You don't have to do it.

373
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:51,137
If I don't, they will.

374
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,005
He made that clear.

375
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,874
They need a sacrifice,

376
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:56,175
and I'm it.

377
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:58,077
[laughing]

378
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,715
Why is he always laughing?

379
00:28:06,786 --> 00:28:09,388
What's he got to be happy about?

380
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:16,395
Why is everybody so happy?

381
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:19,198
'Cause they're not me,
that's why.

382
00:28:22,935 --> 00:28:24,236
Let's go home.

383
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,404
No.

384
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,940
No, I can't.

385
00:28:27,974 --> 00:28:29,842
[laughter]

386
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,312
We'll do it
with a knife, Hector,

387
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:35,447
when everyone has gone to bed.

388
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:38,050
The two of us...
to the end.

389
00:28:38,084 --> 00:28:39,318
I don't understand.

390
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:40,920
What can I do?

391
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:42,789
I couldn't help you die.

392
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:44,791
We'll help each other.
We must.

393
00:28:44,824 --> 00:28:47,493
We've been through
this whole mess together.

394
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,529
You don't understand, do you?

395
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,532
I'm asking you to die with me.

396
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,803
You're my closest,
my dearest slave.

397
00:28:56,836 --> 00:28:58,771
What would they say about me

398
00:28:58,805 --> 00:29:01,107
if you refuse to die with me?

399
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,843
You keep saying "we".

400
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:04,844
Why we?

401
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:06,378
Wh-what have I done?

402
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:07,980
I've done nothing.

403
00:29:08,014 --> 00:29:09,248
I--I know nothing...

404
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:11,383
At Cyprian's this morning,

405
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:14,353
I had to sign certain papers,

406
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:16,856
tell a bit of a story.

407
00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:18,124
What kind of story?

408
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:19,959
A confession.

409
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:23,395
That we were plotting against
Cyprian and the provincial senate

410
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:25,397
and were short of names.

411
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:28,000
Most of the people I know
were in the room,

412
00:29:28,034 --> 00:29:31,003
people I thought were my friends.

413
00:29:31,037 --> 00:29:32,238
So I mentioned you.

414
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:34,140
And what did I do?

415
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:36,008
You stole money from Cyprian

416
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:39,511
to bribe and corrupt
members of the senate.

417
00:29:39,545 --> 00:29:44,150
You're a rebel against the state--
nasty piece of work.

418
00:29:44,183 --> 00:29:45,551
Can I sit down?

419
00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:47,053
Of course.

420
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:53,392
Do you think we go
anywhere else when we die?

421
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:55,427
I don't know.

422
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:57,429
They say so.

423
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:59,031
I hope not.

424
00:29:59,065 --> 00:30:01,300
I just... want it to stop.

425
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,302
Just stop.

426
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:05,171
If I die a slave,

427
00:30:05,204 --> 00:30:07,439
will I be a slave forever?

428
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:11,310
I would think so, wouldn't you?

429
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:12,945
I'm sorry, Hector.

430
00:30:17,216 --> 00:30:20,186
But I would be honored...

431
00:30:20,219 --> 00:30:22,821
if you would die with me.

432
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:46,445
Father, can I talk to you?

433
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:47,446
Not now.

434
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:50,082
I want to tell you
about the world.

435
00:30:50,116 --> 00:30:52,218
You can tell me... later.

436
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:53,452
Thanks, Hector.

437
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:58,624
If he eats the grain,
it means yes.

438
00:30:58,657 --> 00:31:01,460
He's eating.
He's saying yes.

439
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:03,029
Yes, we should die.

440
00:31:03,062 --> 00:31:04,430
You asked if we had to die

441
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:06,032
or if there's another way.

442
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:08,000
It's saying,
"yes, there's another way".

443
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:10,369
No, it's saying,
"yes, we should die".

444
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:11,237
What?

445
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:15,007
Get the knife.
We'll do it the other way.

446
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:23,015
Solus, I'm eating chicken again.

447
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:25,384
I ate chicken yesterday

448
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:28,020
and the day before that.

449
00:31:28,054 --> 00:31:30,589
Will I be eating chicken
again tomorrow?

450
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,224
Why am I always eating chicken?

451
00:31:32,258 --> 00:31:34,260
That's what we have
in the kitchen.

452
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:37,163
The chickens have just
been turning up.

453
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:41,500
Two men have come to see you...

454
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:43,002
from Cyprian.

455
00:32:09,061 --> 00:32:10,696
Good evening, Lucinnius.

456
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:14,700
Cyprian sent us to ask if we
could be of any assistance

457
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:17,503
in the business you have
to conduct tonight,

458
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:20,672
to make that business as
comfortable as you would wish.

459
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:26,112
Uh...

460
00:32:26,145 --> 00:32:27,946
Thank you, gentlemen.

461
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:32,184
I will be capable

462
00:32:32,218 --> 00:32:35,187
of taking care
of my affairs tonight

463
00:32:35,221 --> 00:32:36,622
without your help.

464
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:38,290
Thank Cyprian

465
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:39,758
for his kind thought.

466
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,593
We're spending the night

467
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:44,030
at the house of Nepos
across the street.

468
00:32:44,063 --> 00:32:47,333
Don't hesitate to
send your man for us.

469
00:32:47,366 --> 00:32:50,036
We're anxious that things
go well for you.

470
00:32:51,537 --> 00:32:52,671
Thank you.

471
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:54,173
Good night.

472
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:55,641
We'll call in the morning.

473
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:56,675
Good night.

474
00:32:58,377 --> 00:33:00,179
Thank you.

475
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:01,580
He looks like the kind

476
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:03,382
that's going to need some help.

477
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:10,122
You ever killed before?

478
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:11,523
Just a couple of chickens.

479
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:13,025
It's not much different.

480
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:14,226
Use a thin blade, but long.

481
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,362
Get it in deep, the heart.

482
00:33:16,395 --> 00:33:18,097
Go between the ribs.

483
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,099
Or go in from the back,

484
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:21,500
any place he'll let you.

485
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:24,236
Getting it out's not
as easy as you'd think.

486
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:26,672
You have to twist to get
over the stickiness.

487
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:28,507
If it gets messy,

488
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,542
you come and get us.

489
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:45,724
If we're going to die,

490
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:48,026
can I die a free man?

491
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:52,564
I don't want to die a slave.

492
00:33:55,434 --> 00:33:57,403
Very well, Hector, you're free.

493
00:33:57,436 --> 00:33:59,405
I don't know the exact words.

494
00:33:59,438 --> 00:34:01,407
I've never done it before.

495
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,375
Can you put that in writing

496
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:06,112
so when they find me
in the morning,

497
00:34:06,145 --> 00:34:08,280
they'll know I died a free man?

498
00:34:08,314 --> 00:34:10,449
Very well.

499
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:17,489
It's a nice thought.

500
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:20,326
You were right to ask.

501
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:22,194
Thank you.

502
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:25,731
Well, freed man, let's do it.

503
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:29,335
What do you want me to do?

504
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:31,503
Nothing.
Not--not to me.

505
00:34:31,537 --> 00:34:33,139
I have to do it first.

506
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,475
You understand?

507
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:37,743
I understand.

508
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:39,345
And then you.

509
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:41,447
No. Oh. Oh. Oh.

510
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,215
If I don't succeed...

511
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,685
Stop it, Hector.

512
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:48,287
Then you...

513
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,888
You must help me.

514
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,657
Oh.

515

Mm-hmm.

Aah! Aah! Aah!

Aah!

I did it.

524
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:37,403
On the stairs I did it.

525
00:35:37,436 --> 00:35:39,405
It hurts.

526
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:40,439
It stings.

00:35:56,355 --> 00:35:58,590
This is hopeless.

You've done it.

You promised.

I'll need the knife.

Take it.

544
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,512
Do it, Hector.

545
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:57,649
Oh!

546
00:36:57,683 --> 00:36:59,251
Take it, Hector.

547
00:36:59,285 --> 00:37:00,686
Take it, take it.

548
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,454
Do it.

00:37:02,488 --> 00:37:03,855

best foot forward
in a dead man's shoes,

557
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:30,542
the man walked out
into his own story...

558

Come on.

A free man.

00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:43,555
The captain wants to see you.

561
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:44,856
Up there.

562
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:48,827
But that is another story.

563
00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:19,024
[priest] We want to praise god

564
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:22,027
because we live
in this ultimate age

565
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,830
when all things are done.

566
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:27,065
O.K., this man...

567
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:29,067
he'd been through the wars,

568
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,404
and he'd been traveling a long time

569
00:39:32,438 --> 00:39:33,772
through strange lands,

570
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:36,174
but he was on his way home.

571
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,710
[priest] All god's chosen

572
00:39:38,744 --> 00:39:40,779
gathered in paradise.

573
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:43,114
I struggle against it.

574
00:39:43,148 --> 00:39:46,117
I will not join myself
carnally with any woman.

575
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:48,720
I will carry my unspilt seed

576

577
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:53,091
as should every man.

578
00:39:56,795 --> 00:39:58,764
I've written a small treatise

579
00:39:58,797 --> 00:40:00,799
in favor of virginity, sister.

580
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:04,603
We could discuss it later,
if you like.

What are you talking about?

582
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:09,808
It's simple, brother.

583
00:40:10,976 --> 00:40:13,545
If we cease carnal union entirely,

584
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:15,013
in 50 or so years,

585
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:17,749
we'll all be rid
of our earthly lives,

586
00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:20,151
and god can proceed with his reign

587
00:40:20,185 --> 00:40:21,753
over his heavenly kingdom,

588
00:40:21,787 --> 00:40:24,790
that same paradise that
god gave to man before,

589
00:40:24,823 --> 00:40:27,192
but which man was
so unfit to inhabit

590
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:28,794
that within seven hours,

591
00:40:28,827 --> 00:40:31,196
Eve was already tempting
her master and mate,

592
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:32,798
and within nine hours,

593
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:35,867
the lord had to expel
the both of them.

Keep out of the way of temptation.

I saw the way you were
eyeing that widow.

If anyone's going to dally
with her, it will be me.

612
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:23,174
You couldn't handle her.
She'd bewitch you.

Why don't you get off
up the road tomorrow?

Why do I talk so much?

You weren't even thinking of her

618
00:42:39,825 --> 00:42:41,927
till I opened my mouth.

619

But I trust you, Hector.

620
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:46,197
You're not a sinner.
You wouldn't do anything

to anger your god or me.

Nothing at all. I just said no.

I brought it because
I was near the table,

This woman's got to you.

It's not her.
I'm fed up being like your slave.

01:02:38,155 --> 01:02:39,223
Over there.

859
01:02:42,893 --> 01:02:46,063
Sometimes one day
changes everything.

860
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:48,799
Sometimes years change nothing.

861
01:02:50,067 --> 01:02:52,469
I won't look.

862
01:02:54,171 --> 01:02:57,274
Do you think I'll still see Europe?

863
01:02:57,307 --> 01:02:59,877
I think there's more of a chance

864
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:01,278
of me eating you.

865
01:03:01,311 --> 01:03:03,280
[father Diogo] God has seen fit

866
01:03:03,313 --> 01:03:05,916
to preserve us
for six days on this raft

867
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:08,318
and bring us safely to shore.

868
01:03:08,352 --> 01:03:11,321
I don't think
he'll abandon us now,

869
01:03:11,355 --> 01:03:14,324
so let's get to work, my friends.

870
01:03:14,358 --> 01:03:15,159
Come, come.

871
01:03:15,192 --> 01:03:18,362
Africa must be full
of meat and drink.

872
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:22,399
See, there's this man,

873
01:03:22,432 --> 01:03:24,001
and he wakes up

874
01:03:24,034 --> 01:03:27,004
into the only world
he'll ever know--

875
01:03:27,037 --> 01:03:28,005
shipwrecked,

876
01:03:28,038 --> 01:03:29,406
washed up.

877
01:03:29,439 --> 01:03:31,408
The worst of it is,

878
01:03:31,441 --> 01:03:33,410
he's washed up once again

879
01:03:33,443 --> 01:03:36,981
with the lover he had
so cruelly forsaken.

880
01:03:37,014 --> 01:03:38,348
Where's the small box?

881
01:03:38,382 --> 01:03:40,918
We had it on the raft.

882
01:03:40,951 --> 01:03:42,452
Dona.

883
01:03:42,486 --> 01:03:44,054
Dona Ursula.

884
01:03:44,088 --> 01:03:45,555
Let me help.

885
01:03:45,589 --> 01:03:48,158
I'll get it.
Allow me, please.

886
01:03:48,192 --> 01:03:49,159
No.

887
01:03:49,193 --> 01:03:51,628
Let me help.
Let me help you.

888
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:54,064
Leave me alone!

889
01:03:54,098 --> 01:03:55,465
Don't be a martyr.

890
01:03:55,499 --> 01:03:57,167
Let me have it.

891
01:03:58,936 --> 01:03:59,937
Señor Hector.

892
01:04:01,071 --> 01:04:02,039
Uhh!

893
01:04:02,072 --> 01:04:03,507
[Andre] Come and help me.

894
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:04,508
Let me help.

895
01:04:04,541 --> 01:04:05,943
Don't.

896
01:04:05,976 --> 01:04:08,378
[Andre] Look. I found the box.

897
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:11,415
I'm sorry.

898
01:04:13,150 --> 01:04:16,887
What was the story
between this man and this woman?

899
01:04:16,921 --> 01:04:18,188
Shipwreck?

900
01:04:18,222 --> 01:04:19,656
Heartbreak?

901
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:20,991
The usual.

902
01:04:24,128 --> 01:04:26,096
Yeah, lots of different stories

903
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:29,133
washed up on this shore.

904
01:04:29,166 --> 01:04:31,135
How many made it?

905
01:04:31,168 --> 01:04:32,436
80 men,

906
01:04:32,469 --> 01:04:33,971
10 women,

907
01:04:34,004 --> 01:04:35,072
18 children,

908
01:04:35,105 --> 01:04:36,506
and 45 slaves.

909
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:37,507
10 women?

910
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:39,576
We got you a big chair.

911
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:42,146
Where do you want it, in or out?

912
01:04:42,179 --> 01:04:43,147
Out.

913
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:45,115
We got your table, sir.

914
01:04:45,149 --> 01:04:46,516
Where do you want it?

915
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:48,485
Uh, right there, please.

916
01:04:48,518 --> 01:04:50,988
Hurry up with that table!

917
01:04:51,021 --> 01:04:52,990
I've lost a rather valuable ring,

918
01:04:53,023 --> 01:04:55,592
and I'd like it to be found.

919
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:56,626
Please.

920
01:05:03,467 --> 01:05:06,036
Francisco, I have
some cloth and carpet.

921
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:08,438
I thought if we worked together,

922
01:05:08,472 --> 01:05:10,507
we could make a better shelter.

923
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,710
At least ask dona Ursula.

924
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:15,312
I don't have to ask her.

925
01:05:15,345 --> 01:05:18,548
I know she'd agree with me.
Leave us alone.

926
01:05:18,582 --> 01:05:21,151
Well, at least take the cloth.

927
01:05:21,185 --> 01:05:23,053
The carpet, the cloth.

928
01:05:23,087 --> 01:05:23,887
Keep it.

929
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,123
Build your own hovel somewhere else.

930
01:05:26,156 --> 01:05:27,524
Leave her alone, Hector.

931
01:05:27,557 --> 01:05:29,493
Francisco, I have some rope.

932
01:05:29,526 --> 01:05:31,061
Thanks, Nuno.

933
01:05:31,095 --> 01:05:32,462
I'll see you later.

934
01:05:32,496 --> 01:05:33,930
All right.

935
01:05:38,302 --> 01:05:40,570
Life is harder now.

936
01:05:47,077 --> 01:05:48,445
Where's my hat?

937
01:05:48,478 --> 01:05:50,580
It's in the bag.

938
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:52,516
Dear god.

939
01:05:53,717 --> 01:05:54,718
Nothing.

940
01:06:02,492 --> 01:06:05,462
Send 2 parties of 10 men each--

941
01:06:05,495 --> 01:06:07,064
one to the north,

942
01:06:07,097 --> 01:06:09,566
one to the south.
Bring back what you can--

943
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:11,035
Game, fruit, anything.

944
01:06:11,068 --> 01:06:12,436
Are you serious?

945
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:15,605
Send someone back when
you find fresh water.

946
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:18,042
Any trouble, discharge three shots.

947
01:06:18,075 --> 01:06:19,443
No, j-just one.

948
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:21,711
One shot, perhaps two.

949
01:06:21,745 --> 01:06:23,647
[gunshot]

950
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,982
Ohh!
Ohh!

951
01:06:26,783 --> 01:06:28,185
[bang]

952
01:06:28,218 --> 01:06:29,219
[bang]

953
01:06:30,754 --> 01:06:32,089
[bang]

954
01:06:32,122 --> 01:06:33,123
[bang]

955
01:06:51,175 --> 01:06:53,543
They run off with the dried bread, sir,

956
01:06:53,577 --> 01:06:56,213
And most of the fresh water.

957
01:06:56,246 --> 01:06:58,115
There were eight of them.

958
01:06:58,148 --> 01:06:59,516
We got these two.

959
01:06:59,549 --> 01:07:01,718
Why were you running away?

960
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:03,753
Why were you leaving us?

961
01:07:03,787 --> 01:07:05,355
You men are deserters,

962
01:07:05,389 --> 01:07:07,424
and you will die tomorrow.

963
01:07:07,457 --> 01:07:08,692
With all respect,

964
01:07:08,725 --> 01:07:10,527
these sentences can't be lawful.

965
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:11,561
You don't think so?

966
01:07:11,595 --> 01:07:13,130
Of course not.

967
01:07:13,163 --> 01:07:14,198
They must hang.

968
01:07:14,231 --> 01:07:15,665
They were stealing our bread.

969
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:17,667
I didn't steal any bread.

970
01:07:17,701 --> 01:07:19,269
Gomes stole the bread.

971
01:07:19,303 --> 01:07:20,470
He's away.

972
01:07:20,504 --> 01:07:22,372
[Dom Paulo]
What do you think, father?

973
01:07:22,406 --> 01:07:23,373
I'll comfort them

974
01:07:23,407 --> 01:07:24,741
whether they live or die.

975
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:27,577
[Francisco]
There must be proper justice.

976
01:07:27,611 --> 01:07:29,613
[deserter]
I didn't steal any bread.

977
01:07:29,646 --> 01:07:31,181
[Salgado]
You must decide, sir.

978
01:07:31,215 --> 01:07:33,150
Gomes told us to run.

979
01:07:33,183 --> 01:07:35,051
[Dom Paulo] I'll decide!

980
01:07:37,587 --> 01:07:40,157
No, I won't.
We'll all decide.

981
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:42,626
Most of the people
that matter are here.

982
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:44,628
We'll have a vote.

983
01:07:44,661 --> 01:07:46,630
Who agrees
with Salgado and me

984
01:07:46,663 --> 01:07:48,498
that they should die?

985
01:07:58,208 --> 01:07:59,543
And those against death?

986
01:08:04,481 --> 01:08:06,850
You can't vote!

987
01:08:06,883 --> 01:08:09,119
This isn't working out, dom Paulo.

988
01:08:09,153 --> 01:08:10,554
We need authority.

989
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:12,189
You must decide.

990
01:08:12,222 --> 01:08:13,690
Very well.

991
01:08:13,723 --> 01:08:14,691
Da Cunha.

992
01:08:14,724 --> 01:08:15,559
Sir?

993
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:17,727
The cross the carpenter's
working on,

994
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:20,330
have him turn it
into a scaffold.

995
01:08:20,364 --> 01:08:23,200
Have it erected
away from the women.

996
01:08:23,233 --> 01:08:25,202
Executions will be
at sunrise tomorrow.

997
01:08:25,235 --> 01:08:26,270
Tell father Diogo.

998
01:08:26,303 --> 01:08:27,437
Take them to the raft.

999
01:08:27,471 --> 01:08:30,607
Are we all in agreement
with hanging?

1000
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:33,877
Should we shoot them or what?

1001
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:36,413
Hanging is fine, sir.

1002
01:08:38,182 --> 01:08:39,549
Very well.

1003
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:41,351
Who's going to conduct
the executions?

1004
01:08:41,385 --> 01:08:43,387
Shall we choose someone

1005
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:45,355
Or have a volunteer?

1006
01:08:45,389 --> 01:08:46,356
Hector.

1007
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:47,757
I'm not good with ropes.

1008
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:50,360
I can barely tie my own shoes.

1009
01:08:50,394 --> 01:08:52,262
I'll do it.

1010
01:08:52,296 --> 01:08:53,663
At sunrise tomorrow.

1011
01:08:53,697 --> 01:08:55,899
Send the priest to them tonight.

1012
01:08:55,932 --> 01:08:57,901
He found your ring.

1013
01:08:57,934 --> 01:08:58,902
Me.

1014
01:08:58,935 --> 01:09:00,570
We found it.

1015
01:09:00,604 --> 01:09:02,306
Well...

1016
01:09:02,339 --> 01:09:04,541
thank you.

1017
01:09:04,574 --> 01:09:05,709
I found it.

1018
01:09:12,349 --> 01:09:14,284
Good work, Andre.

1019
01:09:14,318 --> 01:09:15,885
Thank you.

1020
01:09:19,623 --> 01:09:22,426
You go sleep by the big fire.

1021
01:09:22,459 --> 01:09:24,494
Oh...

1022
01:09:24,528 --> 01:09:26,296
Yes.

1023
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:27,297
Good night.

1024
01:09:27,331 --> 01:09:29,533
Well, they were
as close to friends

1025
01:09:29,566 --> 01:09:31,935
as a master and a slave can be.

1026
01:09:31,968 --> 01:09:32,936
Keep warm.

1027
01:09:32,969 --> 01:09:34,170
I'll try!

1028
01:09:35,872 --> 01:09:36,973
And the woman...

1029
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:40,977
Well, perhaps they were
as close to friends

1030
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:43,213
as two old lovers can be.

1031
01:09:51,688 --> 01:09:52,922
Hector?

1032
01:09:52,956 --> 01:09:53,957
One moment.

1033
01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:56,826
Oh!

1034
01:10:00,397 --> 01:10:01,365
Nuno.

1035
01:10:01,398 --> 01:10:02,666
Here's what they found.

1036
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,768
There are four for each of us.

1037
01:10:04,801 --> 01:10:07,371
They taste kind
of milky, but sour.

1038
01:10:07,404 --> 01:10:08,772
Thank you, Nuno.

1039
01:10:08,805 --> 01:10:11,841
My mother ate three
and she was sick,

1040
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:13,443
so try two.

1041
01:10:13,477 --> 01:10:16,746
But she was sick before.
Maybe you can try three.

1042
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:18,282
I'll start with two.

1043
01:10:18,315 --> 01:10:19,283
Hector,

1044
01:10:19,316 --> 01:10:21,751
Lopo, the boy they're going
to hang tomorrow,

1045
01:10:21,785 --> 01:10:24,454
he was my friend on the ship.

1046
01:10:24,488 --> 01:10:27,857
I was going to take him
something to eat.

1047
01:10:27,891 --> 01:10:29,859
I thought... maybe two of yours

1048
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:31,461
and two of mine?

1049
01:10:31,495 --> 01:10:32,862
What about tomorrow, Nuno?

1050
01:10:32,896 --> 01:10:35,365
What am I going to eat tomorrow?

1051
01:10:35,399 --> 01:10:37,767
Dom Paulo would call it a waste.

1052
01:10:37,801 --> 01:10:38,568
[women singing]

1053
01:10:38,602 --> 01:10:40,370
You've got to keep yourself strong.

1054
01:10:40,404 --> 01:10:42,306
That's what he'd say.

1055
01:10:42,339 --> 01:10:44,641
God knows what's
going to happen to us.

1056
01:10:44,674 --> 01:10:46,476
We need you to be strong.

1057
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:51,615
What if I take one to Lopo
and the other to dona Ursula

1058
01:10:51,648 --> 01:10:52,649
from you?

1059
01:10:58,922 --> 01:11:00,390
Thank you.

1060
01:11:00,424 --> 01:11:03,393
And if they don't
let you talk to Lopo,

1061
01:11:03,427 --> 01:11:05,395
give them both to the lady.

1062
01:11:05,429 --> 01:11:06,796
Thank you, Hector.

1063
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:07,631
Thank you.

1064
01:11:11,468 --> 01:11:14,404
So, what was the priest to do

1065
01:11:14,438 --> 01:11:15,805
but bless the men?

1066
01:11:15,839 --> 01:11:17,941
There's water for one more day.

1067
01:11:17,974 --> 01:11:19,943
What do we do then?

1068
01:11:19,976 --> 01:11:21,578
Keep hanging people.

1069
01:11:23,547 --> 01:11:25,281
That'll solve the problem.

1070
01:11:26,583 --> 01:11:28,652
I wish they'd hurry up
with these two.

1071
01:11:28,685 --> 01:11:29,653
Hector!

1072
01:11:29,686 --> 01:11:30,920
What?

1073
01:11:30,954 --> 01:11:32,689
Hector, please!

1074
01:11:32,722 --> 01:11:34,824
Hector.

1075
01:11:34,858 --> 01:11:35,825
Yes?

1076
01:11:35,859 --> 01:11:39,529
Thanks for the fruit, Hector.

1077
01:11:39,563 --> 01:11:41,365
Promise me when we're dead

1078
01:11:41,398 --> 01:11:43,367
you won't let them eat us.

1079
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,601
They said they would.

1080
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:45,602
Who said that?

1081
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:46,603
That was a joke.

1082
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:47,904
That was a joke.

1083
01:11:47,937 --> 01:11:50,907
You won't eat us, will you, Hector?

1084
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:53,510
Oh, no. I won't eat you, Lopo.

1085
01:11:53,543 --> 01:11:54,511
Thank you.

1086
01:11:54,544 --> 01:11:55,745
You won't eat me, either?

1087
01:11:55,779 --> 01:11:57,747
Oh, god, no.

1088
01:11:57,781 --> 01:11:59,449
I'd never eat you.

1089
01:11:59,483 --> 01:12:00,617
No offense.

1090
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:01,818
Thanks.

1091
01:12:01,851 --> 01:12:03,086
You're welcome.

1092
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:04,087
Come on.

1093
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:05,689
I'm going to walk.

1094
01:12:05,722 --> 01:12:07,090
I want to walk!

1095
01:12:07,123 --> 01:12:10,960
Please let me walk, for god's sake!

1096
01:12:10,994 --> 01:12:12,729
Please let me walk!

1097
01:12:24,808 --> 01:12:27,577
Everyone kept their distance.

1098
01:12:27,611 --> 01:12:28,845
What now?

1099
01:12:28,878 --> 01:12:30,480
God knows.

1100
01:12:30,514 --> 01:12:32,982
Like any priest anywhere,

1101
01:12:33,016 --> 01:12:36,453
all he wanted was a sign.

1102
01:12:43,493 --> 01:12:44,894
We're being watched.

1103
01:12:46,496 --> 01:12:48,097
We're being watched.

1104
01:12:55,104 --> 01:12:58,074
I bet some gunpowder
would scare them.

1105
01:12:58,107 --> 01:13:00,076
No. They might be friendly.

1106
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:01,911
Then they'll have food.

1107
01:13:01,945 --> 01:13:03,513
That's right.

1108
01:13:03,547 --> 01:13:05,515
We mustn't be timid.
You.

1109
01:13:06,916 --> 01:13:08,818
Go and talk to them.

1110
01:13:08,852 --> 01:13:09,819
No.

1111
01:13:09,853 --> 01:13:10,820
Go on.

1112
01:13:10,854 --> 01:13:12,822
Go on.
Get up there.

1113
01:13:12,856 --> 01:13:14,424
That's right.

1114
01:13:14,458 --> 01:13:16,693
Be friendly.

1115
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:18,194
Smile.

1116
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:19,095
Go on.

1117
01:13:19,128 --> 01:13:21,865
Don't you want a little
drink of water?

1118
01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:24,400
Go, go, go, go.

1119
01:13:43,052 --> 01:13:45,822
Oh...god.

1120
01:14:04,073 --> 01:14:06,109
What's this?

1121
01:14:07,544 --> 01:14:09,513
A bit of bread and raisins.

1122
01:14:09,546 --> 01:14:12,516
Thought everything had
been shared on the raft.

1123
01:14:12,549 --> 01:14:13,917
Well, that wasn't.

1124
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:16,786
It's for her... and for you.

1125
01:14:38,608 --> 01:14:40,409
I must speak to her.

1126
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:47,016
He could talk to them.

1127
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:49,085
There's just the two.

1128
01:14:49,118 --> 01:14:51,621
Their leader arrives tomorrow.

1129
01:14:51,655 --> 01:14:53,657
Well, thank god we're safe.

1130
01:14:55,925 --> 01:14:58,628
Oh. And they said
not to sacrifice

1131
01:14:58,662 --> 01:15:01,765
any more men for them.
They don't like that.

1132
01:15:01,798 --> 01:15:03,633
They don't like that.

1133
01:15:10,874 --> 01:15:11,908
Nuno!

1134
01:15:13,977 --> 01:15:15,779
It's stuff from the ship!

1135
01:15:15,812 --> 01:15:17,781
Did you give her the fruit?

1136
01:15:17,814 --> 01:15:18,782
Yes.

1137
01:15:18,815 --> 01:15:20,116
What did she say?

1138
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:21,785
She said thank you.

1139
01:15:21,818 --> 01:15:23,186
Anything else?

1140
01:15:23,219 --> 01:15:24,788
Well, go on. Run!

1141
01:15:24,821 --> 01:15:26,189
Don't just stand there.

1142
01:15:26,222 --> 01:15:27,891
See if there's anything.

1143
01:15:27,924 --> 01:15:28,958
Run!

1144
01:15:32,829 --> 01:15:34,197
Look at it!

1145
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:35,799
Ha! Just look.

1146
01:15:35,832 --> 01:15:36,600
[laughing]

1147
01:15:36,633 --> 01:15:39,803
Look at that!
Right up on the beach!

1148
01:15:39,836 --> 01:15:40,837
Turtle eggs.

1149
01:15:43,172 --> 01:15:46,142
Dr. Correa was shipping
them to the royal zoo.

1150
01:15:46,175 --> 01:15:49,746
I think he was hoping
they were going to hatch.

1151
01:15:49,779 --> 01:15:53,583
Eggs for supper tonight
for everyone!

1152
01:15:53,617 --> 01:15:54,584
Eggs!

1153
01:15:54,618 --> 01:15:56,653
Eggs! Eggs!

1154
01:15:56,686 --> 01:15:59,155
Why is she doing this to me?

1155
01:15:59,188 --> 01:16:01,290
Why won't she let me speak to her?

1156
01:16:01,324 --> 01:16:02,291
[women singing]

1157
01:16:02,325 --> 01:16:03,893
Oh!

1158
01:16:03,927 --> 01:16:06,162
You'd think in this awful situation--

1159
01:16:06,195 --> 01:16:08,064
death and pain all around her--

1160
01:16:08,097 --> 01:16:10,066
that she'd want to reconcile herself

1161
01:16:10,099 --> 01:16:12,335
to someone who cares for her.

1162
01:16:12,368 --> 01:16:15,605
Why can't I see her?
I just want to apologize.

1163
01:16:17,006 --> 01:16:18,574
Oh...

1164
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:22,078
You have any eggs left?

1165
01:16:22,111 --> 01:16:24,313
The slaves only got three.

1166
01:16:24,347 --> 01:16:25,314
Yours were fine?

1167
01:16:25,348 --> 01:16:26,816
Yes.

1168
01:16:26,850 --> 01:16:28,217
I'm unlucky, Andre.

1169
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:29,819
I'm unlucky with women,

1170
01:16:29,853 --> 01:16:32,188
I'm unlucky with eggs.

1171
01:16:32,221 --> 01:16:35,224
Have you eaten all of your eggs?

1172
01:16:36,225 --> 01:16:36,993
Yes.

1173
01:16:37,026 --> 01:16:40,196
At least one of us is well-fed, huh?

1174
01:16:40,229 --> 01:16:42,131
How are you doing, Andre?

1175
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:45,935
I only have one small problem.

1176
01:16:45,969 --> 01:16:48,738
You still keep calling me Andre.

1177
01:16:48,772 --> 01:16:50,139
Oh, god. I'm sorry.

1178
01:16:50,173 --> 01:16:52,075
I did promise, didn't I?

1179
01:16:52,108 --> 01:16:53,677
I want to die...

1180
01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:56,145
at least with my real name.

Ohh.

Five deaths this morning.

We've stopped people
eating the fruit,

1197
01:17:26,710 --> 01:17:30,313
but some people just
ate too many eggs.

1198
01:17:30,346 --> 01:17:31,981
The nuns have gone.

1199
01:17:32,015 --> 01:17:34,350
How many eggs did you have?

1200
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:36,385
Three.
I had them boiled.

1201
01:17:36,419 --> 01:17:37,987
I had four.

1202
01:17:38,021 --> 01:17:40,023
I don't feel very well.

1203
01:17:40,056 --> 01:17:41,424
Four's all right.

1204
01:17:41,457 --> 01:17:44,393
The really sick ones had 8, 10.

1205
01:17:44,427 --> 01:17:48,231
Let's not talk about it.
What do you have?

1206
01:17:48,264 --> 01:17:50,834
We'll have to trade for food.

1207
01:17:50,867 --> 01:17:53,269
They'll go for this--copper...

1208
01:17:53,302 --> 01:17:54,804
nails.

1209
01:18:05,248 --> 01:18:09,318
We're going to
meet a king today. Hup.

1210
01:18:09,352 --> 01:18:10,319
Dom Paulo,

1211
01:18:10,353 --> 01:18:11,921
they've arrived.

1212
01:18:11,955 --> 01:18:13,356
Excellent.

1213
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:28,237
That's it?

1214
01:18:28,271 --> 01:18:29,839
[mules braying]

1215
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:42,118
Where's the king?

1216
01:18:43,119 --> 01:18:45,789
He's not a real king,

1217
01:18:45,822 --> 01:18:48,124
But they are his camels.

1218
01:18:48,157 --> 01:18:51,060
[speaking native language]

1219
01:18:51,094 --> 01:18:53,062
He doesn't know if you're real.

1220
01:18:53,096 --> 01:18:54,063
He wants to see your navel

1221
01:18:54,097 --> 01:18:57,466
so he'll be sure you were
born like real people.

1222
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:58,501
My navel?

1223
01:19:03,272 --> 01:19:04,908
You four also.

1224
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:16,886
Now he wants to see you breathe.

1225
01:19:18,855 --> 01:19:20,056
Breathe.

1226
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:21,290
Breathe.

1227
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:30,566
And it shall be called

1228
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:33,036
the way of holiness.

1229
01:19:33,069 --> 01:19:35,304
The unclean shall not pass...

1230
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:40,343
and the thirsty land
springs of water.

1231
01:19:44,047 --> 01:19:46,215
Water.

1232
01:19:46,249 --> 01:19:47,817
And the mule.

1233
01:19:47,851 --> 01:19:49,285
And the mule.

1234
01:19:53,522 --> 01:19:56,926
So many stories--

1235
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:59,128
crosses, eggs, nails,

1236
01:19:59,162 --> 01:20:00,529
shipwrecks, hanged men,

1237
01:20:00,563 --> 01:20:02,031
feasts, ropes,

1238
01:20:02,065 --> 01:20:03,499
corpses, bread,

1239
01:20:03,532 --> 01:20:04,500
wine, lovers.

1240
01:20:04,533 --> 01:20:06,602
Suck out the marrow.

1241
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:08,304
That's the best bit.

1242
01:20:08,337 --> 01:20:10,573
But in the end,

1243
01:20:10,606 --> 01:20:14,477
isn't every story
all the one story?

1244
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:18,514
Where's Francisco?

1245
01:20:18,547 --> 01:20:20,116
Dona Ursula's sick.

1246
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:21,918
[Da Cunha] What about the sick?

1247
01:20:21,951 --> 01:20:24,320
How are they going to walk?

1248
01:20:24,353 --> 01:20:25,488
I'm staying here.

1249
01:20:25,521 --> 01:20:28,057
I'm going to work on that raft,

1250
01:20:28,091 --> 01:20:29,292
then I'm sailing home.

1251
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:31,460
You can't.
They've taken all the nails!

1252
01:20:31,494 --> 01:20:33,362
What about them, dom Paulo?

1253
01:20:33,396 --> 01:20:35,932
I've been discussing it
with father Diogo.

1254
01:20:35,965 --> 01:20:38,134
I can't see how a hundred of us

1255
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:40,136
can carry back 70 sick.

1256
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:43,139
Going to take your big cross
into the desert, Diogo?

1257
01:20:43,172 --> 01:20:45,541
I thought we'd make a smaller one.

1258
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:46,442
[laughing]

1259
01:20:46,475 --> 01:20:49,112
I'm going to search
the scriptures tonight

1260
01:20:49,145 --> 01:20:50,513
to find an answer.

1261
01:20:50,546 --> 01:20:52,581
An excuse, you mean.

1262
01:20:54,517 --> 01:20:55,985
Francisco.

1263
01:20:58,387 --> 01:21:01,357
Will you share a bottle
of wine with me?

1264
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:03,927
I've had it since we left the ship,

1265
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:07,363
and I want to drink it
tonight with you.

1266
01:21:11,634 --> 01:21:13,369
You should hang for this.

1267
01:21:13,402 --> 01:21:15,972
Some of the people
might have lived

1268
01:21:16,005 --> 01:21:18,374
with a glass of this
in their stomachs.

1269
01:21:18,407 --> 01:21:19,976
We'll save Ursula a glass.

1270
01:21:20,009 --> 01:21:21,244
Yeah, we will.

1271
01:21:26,582 --> 01:21:29,552
The natives are taking us to water.

1272
01:21:29,585 --> 01:21:31,154
We're leaving tomorrow.

1273
01:21:31,187 --> 01:21:33,156
She won't be traveling anywhere.

1274
01:21:33,189 --> 01:21:34,991
I'm staying with her.

1275
01:21:35,024 --> 01:21:35,791
I know.

1276
01:21:35,824 --> 01:21:39,028
That's why I had to see you tonight.

1277
01:21:41,164 --> 01:21:44,367
So you want to tidy things up
before you leave?

1278
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,369
Put your conscience to rest?

1279
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:48,004
Not just for me.

1280
01:21:48,037 --> 01:21:49,405
For all of us.

1281
01:21:49,438 --> 01:21:53,176
The pain and effort
she puts into despising me

1282
01:21:53,209 --> 01:21:55,678
must be tormenting her...
and you and I.

1283
01:21:55,711 --> 01:21:58,281
Am I selfish to want to stop that?

1284
01:21:58,314 --> 01:21:59,382
I'm your friend, Hector.

1285
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:02,952
Your only mistake was getting
on the same ship home.

1286
01:22:02,986 --> 01:22:05,955
I never meant to get
on your damn ship.

1287
01:22:05,989 --> 01:22:08,958
If I hadn't gotten
on that ship,

1288
01:22:08,992 --> 01:22:10,693
I'd be home now, safe.

1289
01:22:10,726 --> 01:22:12,695
Understand me.
Tomorrow you're leaving.

1290
01:22:12,728 --> 01:22:14,998
Ursula and me, we're staying.

1291
01:22:15,031 --> 01:22:18,401
Believe me, many things
no longer matter to us,

1292
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:20,003
Ursula and me.

1293
01:22:20,036 --> 01:22:22,405
Vanities, hurts from the past,
they're nothing.

1294
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:25,341
They no longer have meaning.

1295
01:22:25,374 --> 01:22:30,279
This is my last bottle of wine.

1296
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:37,620
I think tomorrow she'll talk to you.

1297
01:22:37,653 --> 01:22:38,721
You do?

1298
01:22:38,754 --> 01:22:41,957
I do. And what does it matter?

1299
01:23:15,091 --> 01:23:19,728
I'll never forget you or what
you're doing for these poor people.

1300
01:23:19,762 --> 01:23:21,230
Good luck to you.

1301
01:23:21,264 --> 01:23:24,233
It breaks my heart
to leave you like this.

1302
01:23:24,267 --> 01:23:25,501
What else can I do?

1303
01:23:25,534 --> 01:23:27,103
God protect you.

1304
01:23:27,136 --> 01:23:28,537
Well.

1305
01:23:30,173 --> 01:23:32,541
We're leaving the big cross with you.

1306
01:23:32,575 --> 01:23:34,077
Oh. Thank you.

1307
01:23:34,110 --> 01:23:36,479
And I'll comfort them
as best I can.

1308
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:37,380
You're staying?

1309
01:23:37,413 --> 01:23:40,083
No. No. I'll comfort them
before we leave.

1310
01:23:40,116 --> 01:23:43,152
I think my place
is with you, don't you?

1311
01:23:43,186 --> 01:23:45,488
I think so.

1312
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:47,123
I'll ask her.

1313
01:23:52,095 --> 01:23:54,130
In you go.

1314
01:24:06,675 --> 01:24:08,677
Thank you for seeing me.

1315
01:24:10,613 --> 01:24:13,182
I don't have much to say

1316
01:24:13,216 --> 01:24:16,252
except I'm sorry for all
the hurt I've caused you.

1317
01:24:16,285 --> 01:24:19,255
There are so many things
I could explain.

1318
01:24:19,288 --> 01:24:21,690
How we stupidly
misunderstand each other.

1319
01:24:21,724 --> 01:24:25,461
Later we can talk.

1320
01:24:25,494 --> 01:24:26,462
Later?

1321
01:24:26,495 --> 01:24:28,264
Yes. Later.

1322
01:24:30,299 --> 01:24:32,701
There's no later.
I'm leaving now.

1323
01:24:32,735 --> 01:24:34,837
You're leaving?

1324
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:35,838
Yes.

1325
01:24:35,871 --> 01:24:37,706
You're not staying with us?

1326
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:38,807
I'm living--

1327
01:24:38,841 --> 01:24:40,409
leaving with the others,

1328
01:24:40,443 --> 01:24:42,411
and I want to tell you

1329
01:24:42,445 --> 01:24:45,348
that I will pray
for your soul in Lisbon.

1330
01:24:45,381 --> 01:24:48,651
Oh, you'll pray
for my soul in Lisbon?

1331
01:24:48,684 --> 01:24:50,453
Yes.

1332
01:24:50,486 --> 01:24:51,854
I will.

1333
01:24:51,887 --> 01:24:53,156
At the cathedral?

1334
01:24:53,189 --> 01:24:54,423
At the cathedral.

1335
01:24:54,457 --> 01:24:55,424
Every day.

1336
01:24:55,458 --> 01:24:57,260
[laughs]

1337
01:24:58,361 --> 01:24:59,728
Oh...

1338
01:24:59,762 --> 01:25:01,764
Goodbye, Hector.

1339
01:25:01,797 --> 01:25:03,466
Have a pleasant journey.

1340
01:25:03,499 --> 01:25:05,168
I'll try.

1341
01:25:06,202 --> 01:25:07,603
What?

1342
01:25:08,704 --> 01:25:10,339
Ursula, don't turn away.

1343
01:25:10,373 --> 01:25:13,142
I have so much more to say to you.

1344
01:25:13,176 --> 01:25:16,479
We seem to be misunderstanding
each other again.

1345
01:25:16,512 --> 01:25:18,414
Idiot.

1346
01:25:37,233 --> 01:25:39,268
You've made your peace with her?

1347
01:25:39,302 --> 01:25:41,637
I think so. Yes.

1348
01:25:41,670 --> 01:25:42,771
Thank god.

1349
01:25:44,307 --> 01:25:45,574
Well...

1350
01:25:45,608 --> 01:25:47,210
Goodbye.

1351
01:25:49,512 --> 01:25:52,915
You want me to take
anything back for you?

1352
01:25:52,948 --> 01:25:54,383
A message, letter?

1353
01:25:54,417 --> 01:25:56,452
If you were carrying
something for me,

1354
01:25:56,485 --> 01:25:58,454
I'd have to worry about you.

1355
01:25:58,487 --> 01:26:00,389
If you go empty-handed,

1356
01:26:00,423 --> 01:26:03,426
I can put you out of my mind.

1357
01:26:04,827 --> 01:26:08,697
I want to ask you something.

1358
01:26:08,731 --> 01:26:11,667
There's no easy way to do it.

1359
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:12,935
Go on, Hector.

1360
01:26:12,968 --> 01:26:14,803
Your boots.

1361
01:26:14,837 --> 01:26:16,572
What about them?

1362
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:19,375
Can I have them?

1363
01:26:20,609 --> 01:26:21,977
You can have my shoes.

1364
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:23,479
They're perfect for here.

1365
01:26:23,512 --> 01:26:26,482
I've got to walk 600 miles,
Francisco.

1366
01:26:26,515 --> 01:26:29,252
600 miles in these sandals.

1367
01:26:29,285 --> 01:26:30,653
Yes. You're right.

1368
01:26:30,686 --> 01:26:33,656
I daresay my boots
would take you 600 miles.

1369
01:26:33,689 --> 01:26:35,258
I look after them.

1370
01:26:35,291 --> 01:26:36,525
I'll look after them, too.

1371
01:26:36,559 --> 01:26:38,527
I'll walk all the way home,

1372
01:26:38,561 --> 01:26:41,530
and I'll remember you
in the cathedral in Lisbon.

1373
01:26:41,564 --> 01:26:43,299
In my boots?

1374
01:26:43,332 --> 01:26:44,367
Yes.

1375
01:26:48,604 --> 01:26:49,372
Oh...

1376
01:26:49,405 --> 01:26:51,440
Hector, you have surpassed yourself.

1377
01:26:51,474 --> 01:26:53,309
Sit down. Take my boots.

1378
01:26:53,342 --> 01:26:54,310
Really?

1379
01:26:54,343 --> 01:26:55,711
Yes. Go on.

1380
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:57,446
[laughing]

1381
01:27:02,818 --> 01:27:05,888
Oh. These are fabulous.

1382
01:27:07,856 --> 01:27:10,426
Are they made by Da Fosco?

1383
01:27:10,459 --> 01:27:11,427
Ohh.

1384
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:13,329
Best bootmaker in Goa.

1385
01:27:17,333 --> 01:27:18,501
Oh.

1386
01:27:20,369 --> 01:27:23,339
Hey. Pray for my soul
in Lisbon, Hector.

1387
01:27:23,372 --> 01:27:24,740
I will, Francisco.

1388
01:27:24,773 --> 01:27:26,742
Pray for your own.

1389
01:27:26,775 --> 01:27:27,976
Ha ha ha ha.

1390
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:35,484
You really think you're going
to walk out of here,

1391
01:27:35,518 --> 01:27:36,819
don't you?

1392
01:27:36,852 --> 01:27:38,854
All the way home, Francisco.

1393
01:27:52,401 --> 01:27:53,769
Those are fine boots.

1394
01:27:53,802 --> 01:27:54,770
Aren't they?

1395
01:27:54,803 --> 01:27:57,506
They look a bit big for you.

1396
01:27:57,540 --> 01:27:58,907
Probably more my size.

1397
01:27:58,941 --> 01:28:00,509
No. They're fine.

1398
01:28:00,543 --> 01:28:04,913
Boots the wrong size are
worse than no boots at all.

1399
01:28:04,947 --> 01:28:06,415
Really?

1400
01:28:07,049 --> 01:28:08,417
Aah!

1401
01:28:08,451 --> 01:28:10,419
Oh.

1402
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:47,556
[speaking foreign language]

1403
01:28:54,397 --> 01:28:55,598
Ya. Brooklyn.

1404
01:28:55,631 --> 01:28:57,132
I'm going to Queens.

1405
01:28:57,165 --> 01:28:59,134
Do you know the lady?

1406
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:01,136
Think you'll go to jail again?

1407
01:29:01,169 --> 01:29:04,740
Will you release some
public comment to the press?

1408
01:29:04,773 --> 01:29:06,975
Will you talk to us?

1409
01:29:07,009 --> 01:29:09,712
Oh, Anna. Thank god.

1410
01:29:09,745 --> 01:29:13,115
Yeah. Listen, I'm at
that building in Queens.

1411
01:29:13,148 --> 01:29:15,083
Oh. I need your help.

1412
01:29:15,117 --> 01:29:16,719
Come get me.

1413
01:29:16,752 --> 01:29:18,721
Yeah. There's cops, dogs, everything.

1414
01:29:18,754 --> 01:29:20,122
I'm all right.

1415
01:29:20,155 --> 01:29:21,724
I need your car.

1416
01:29:21,757 --> 01:29:24,727
I don't have time
to get the rental car.

1417
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:27,129
They won't let me out
of the building, Anna.

1418
01:29:27,162 --> 01:29:28,731
Building warrant, license...

1419
01:29:28,764 --> 01:29:30,733
I'm calm.
I'm all right.

1420
01:29:30,766 --> 01:29:32,568
Here's what you do.

1421
01:29:32,601 --> 01:29:34,970
It's not my building.
It's my partner's building.

1422
01:29:35,003 --> 01:29:38,507
I took the call.
I came to see if I could help.

1423
01:29:38,541 --> 01:29:39,908
Slow down, troup.

1424
01:29:39,942 --> 01:29:42,511
So, it's 3:15 on a Friday.

1425
01:29:42,545 --> 01:29:43,979
You are staying here

1426
01:29:44,012 --> 01:29:45,981
until mr. Santiago
gets the paperwork.

1427
01:29:46,014 --> 01:29:48,584
Get your partner over here.
This is serious.

1428
01:29:48,617 --> 01:29:49,585
It's 3:35.

1429
01:29:49,618 --> 01:29:51,587
I might have to close the place.

1430
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:52,988
Why? What happened?

1431
01:29:53,021 --> 01:29:55,891
I danced with a prince
on my 18th birthday!

1432
01:29:55,924 --> 01:29:57,860
And now look at me!

1433
01:29:57,893 --> 01:29:59,462
I warn you Monday!

1434
01:29:59,495 --> 01:30:02,998
I told you the floor
was making noises.

1435
01:30:03,031 --> 01:30:04,600
It wasn't me, mrs...

1436
01:30:04,633 --> 01:30:05,601
Philippopilis.

1437
01:30:05,634 --> 01:30:06,835
Philippopilis.

1438
01:30:06,869 --> 01:30:08,437
Oh, castrate you...

1439
01:30:08,471 --> 01:30:10,005
Are you all right?

1440
01:30:10,038 --> 01:30:12,040
My son sees his mother
laying here...

1441
01:30:12,074 --> 01:30:12,941
he gonna sue you!

1442
01:30:12,975 --> 01:30:15,544
I'm not the landlord,
mrs. Philippopilis.

1443
01:30:15,578 --> 01:30:17,546
Yeah. I'm at the building.

1444
01:30:17,580 --> 01:30:20,783
She fell through the floor
on her toilet.

1445
01:30:20,816 --> 01:30:22,785
It's not funny. No.

1446
01:30:22,818 --> 01:30:24,186
You get down here.

1447
01:30:24,219 --> 01:30:26,789
Why'd you do this to me, Boris?

1448
01:30:26,822 --> 01:30:28,791
They want all sorts of documents.

1449
01:30:28,824 --> 01:30:30,893
The place is crawling with--

1450
01:30:30,926 --> 01:30:32,160
Oh, yeah.

1451
01:30:32,194 --> 01:30:34,196
[speaking Greek]

1452
01:30:34,229 --> 01:30:36,198
Mrs. Philippopilis,
this is my lawyer.

1453
01:30:36,231 --> 01:30:38,701
He wants to ask a question.

1454
01:30:38,734 --> 01:30:41,103
This place is a mess!

1455
01:30:41,136 --> 01:30:42,805
Mrs. P, you poor thing!

1456
01:30:42,838 --> 01:30:45,207
That doesn't sound good,
Leonard. I don't think...

1457
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:46,208
Hey, troup...

1458
01:30:46,241 --> 01:30:47,810
You moving out, mrs. P?

1459
01:30:47,843 --> 01:30:50,178
Is the apartment
going to be available?

1460
01:30:50,212 --> 01:30:52,147
He's not going to the hospital.

1461
01:30:52,180 --> 01:30:53,916
I've got a family emergency.

1462
01:30:53,949 --> 01:30:56,519
Emergency?
What do you call this?

1463
01:30:56,552 --> 01:30:58,153
All right, listen.
O.K., um,

1464
01:30:58,186 --> 01:31:00,155
listen, how's Tuesday
for you, George?

1465
01:31:00,188 --> 01:31:02,157
I'm no good in the morning.

1466
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:05,761
Maybe in the afternoon
I could meet you in the hospital.

1467
01:31:05,794 --> 01:31:06,762
I'll bring flowers.

1468
01:31:06,795 --> 01:31:08,764
Fuck flowers.
Who'll pay for this?

1469
01:31:08,797 --> 01:31:10,766
Who'll check her in the hospital?

1470
01:31:10,799 --> 01:31:12,167
Your building fell down.

1471
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:13,769
It's not my building.

1472
01:31:13,802 --> 01:31:15,170
They won't let me leave.

1473
01:31:15,203 --> 01:31:16,772
They'll love this in court.

1474
01:31:16,805 --> 01:31:19,174
You didn't even ride
to the hospital?

1475
01:31:19,207 --> 01:31:21,777
You got a credit card
or something?

1476
01:31:21,810 --> 01:31:24,179
Yeah. Wait. The guy
you want is right there.

1477
01:31:24,212 --> 01:31:27,182
Can I get him?
That's my partner.

1478
01:31:27,215 --> 01:31:28,784
Can I bring him back?

1479
01:31:28,817 --> 01:31:31,186
Well, they were
as close to friends

1480
01:31:31,219 --> 01:31:33,789
as two mutual slaves
to money may be.

1481
01:31:33,822 --> 01:31:36,191
Boris, asshole,
it's never been this bad.

1482
01:31:36,224 --> 01:31:38,193
Did you bring all the papers?

1483
01:31:38,226 --> 01:31:40,796
Yes. We seem to be
covered for everything.

1484
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:42,631
What do you mean "we"?

1485
01:31:42,665 --> 01:31:43,799
[siren]

1486
01:31:43,832 --> 01:31:45,200
Hey, it's your problem.

1487
01:31:45,233 --> 01:31:46,268
How is she?

1488
01:31:46,301 --> 01:31:48,036
She's a fucking voodoo witch.

1489
01:31:48,070 --> 01:31:50,038
She didn't break a single bone.

1490
01:31:50,072 --> 01:31:53,041
She's yelling at me,
"Jump through. Break both legs."

1491
01:31:53,075 --> 01:31:55,644
Why did you fuck me on this? Why?

1492
01:31:55,678 --> 01:31:57,212
I didn't-- Listen, I'm sorry.

1493
01:31:57,245 --> 01:32:00,215
I just put your name
on the lousy forms.

1494
01:32:00,248 --> 01:32:01,817
I didn't plan this.

1495
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:04,219
I told you, don't
do that anymore, O.K.?

1496
01:32:04,252 --> 01:32:05,821
Just stop doing that.

1497
01:32:05,854 --> 01:32:08,223
It's my name, O.K.?
My name is mine.

1498
01:32:08,256 --> 01:32:10,225
Use your name on the forms.

1499
01:32:10,258 --> 01:32:11,827
Remember that?
Remember your name?

1500
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:13,228
I got it.

1501
01:32:13,261 --> 01:32:14,229
Boris Borlanski!

1502
01:32:14,262 --> 01:32:16,231
Don't let it spoil your weekend.

1503
01:32:16,264 --> 01:32:18,834
You haven't seen these kids
for four years.

1504
01:32:18,867 --> 01:32:20,235
I'll take care of it.

1505
01:32:20,268 --> 01:32:21,837
Who's in charge up there?

1506
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:22,838
Cobb.

1507
01:32:22,871 --> 01:32:24,840
I don't know him. Cobb...

1508
01:32:24,873 --> 01:32:26,241
All right. Go on.

1509
01:32:26,274 --> 01:32:28,844
I promise you'll
walk away from this.

1510
01:32:28,877 --> 01:32:29,845
I'm sorry.

1511
01:32:29,878 --> 01:32:32,247
I'm sorry I blew up at you.

1512
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:34,917
You got to get out
of this business.

1513
01:32:34,950 --> 01:32:37,319
Here she is. Enjoy your weekend.

1514
01:32:37,352 --> 01:32:39,755
I'll straighten everything out.

1515
01:32:39,788 --> 01:32:42,157
Good luck. It's never
been this bad, Boris.

1516
01:32:42,190 --> 01:32:44,893
Everything can be fixed. Always.

1517
01:32:44,927 --> 01:32:45,894
What's up?

1518
01:32:45,928 --> 01:32:48,563
Am I glad to see you.

1519
01:32:49,965 --> 01:32:52,134
Hi. Uh...

1520
01:32:52,167 --> 01:32:54,937
You can drop me off
at the shop, right?

1521
01:32:54,970 --> 01:32:56,338
Yeah. You bring my bag?

1522
01:32:56,371 --> 01:32:57,339
Yep.

1523
01:32:57,372 --> 01:32:58,774
Where is it?

1524
01:32:58,807 --> 01:33:01,176
It's back there.
Your camera's in there, too.

1525
01:33:01,209 --> 01:33:02,177
Thanks.

1526
01:33:02,210 --> 01:33:04,780
Take some photographs of the kids.

1527
01:33:04,813 --> 01:33:08,116
I will.
That's nice. Thanks.

1528
01:33:08,150 --> 01:33:09,785
Don't worry. Come on, relax.

1529
01:33:09,818 --> 01:33:12,821
This is the beginning
of something, not the end.

1530
01:33:12,855 --> 01:33:13,989
Yeah.

1531
01:33:14,022 --> 01:33:17,192
I'm jealous. You're going
to start to be a father again.

1532
01:33:17,225 --> 01:33:19,828
Thanks for talking me into this.

1533
01:33:19,862 --> 01:33:21,063
You were totally ready.

1534
01:33:21,096 --> 01:33:24,066
You're right.
I am ready, aren't I?

1535
01:33:24,099 --> 01:33:26,234
It's been long enough.
I'm ready.

1536
01:33:26,268 --> 01:33:29,672
Oh. I'm going to fix
that shit with Boris.

1537
01:33:29,705 --> 01:33:30,673
Good.

1538
01:33:30,706 --> 01:33:32,074
I can't go on.

1539
01:33:32,107 --> 01:33:34,009
No. I want my freedom.

1540
01:33:34,042 --> 01:33:37,012
And the kids--
it's going to work out, isn't it?

1541
01:33:37,045 --> 01:33:39,414
When it does, they
can come over, right?

1542
01:33:39,447 --> 01:33:40,983
That was the plan.

1543
01:33:41,016 --> 01:33:42,985
When we get a bigger space.

1544
01:33:43,018 --> 01:33:46,254
That's all we need. We'll get
a big apartment together.

1545
01:33:47,389 --> 01:33:51,259
You just said a bigger
apartment together.

1546
01:33:51,293 --> 01:33:53,829
I said that, didn't I?

1547
01:33:53,862 --> 01:33:54,997
Yeah. What?

1548
01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:55,998
Hector.

1549
01:33:56,031 --> 01:33:57,032
What?

1550
01:33:57,065 --> 01:33:58,734
You're a man of decisions today.

1551
01:33:58,767 --> 01:34:00,268
I like this!

1552
01:34:00,302 --> 01:34:02,871
I am. Now get out of my car.

1553
01:34:02,905 --> 01:34:05,240
I don't want to drive
around the block.

1554
01:34:05,273 --> 01:34:06,408
Already it's your car.

1555
01:34:06,441 --> 01:34:07,943
What's the freedom part?

1556
01:34:07,976 --> 01:34:09,344
Freedom's from Boris, not you.

1557
01:34:09,377 --> 01:34:11,947
I'm your slave.
I'm your love slave.

1558
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:14,182
You know? Come on.

1559
01:34:15,884 --> 01:34:17,853
Thanks for the car and everything.

1560
01:34:17,886 --> 01:34:20,255
Do the best you can with them.

1561
01:34:20,288 --> 01:34:22,257
I will. what are those?

1562
01:34:22,290 --> 01:34:24,860
Oh, my god!
You have to deliver them!

1563
01:34:24,893 --> 01:34:26,261
I don't have time.

1564
01:34:26,294 --> 01:34:28,263
It's two blocks before the bridge.

1565
01:34:28,296 --> 01:34:30,265
It's a five-minute detour.

1566
01:34:30,298 --> 01:34:31,734
Who died?

1567
01:34:31,767 --> 01:34:34,136
Nobody died. It's a golden wedding.

1568
01:34:34,169 --> 01:34:37,139
Yeah? Listen, please
don't ask me to do this, O.K.?

1569
01:34:37,172 --> 01:34:38,140
Honey...

1570
01:34:38,173 --> 01:34:39,141
Please.

What?

1573
01:34:41,176 --> 01:34:42,745
You have to.

1574
01:34:42,778 --> 01:34:45,147
You want my car?
You need my car?

1575
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:47,750
This is how we help each other.

1576
01:34:47,783 --> 01:34:48,917
This is a relationship.

1577
01:34:48,951 --> 01:34:51,286
All right. All right.

1578

Thanks.

Don't suffer alone, asshole.

01:34:58,994 --> 01:35:00,362
[chuckles] Thanks.

Hector!

What?

1584
01:35:03,231 --> 01:35:05,200
No gas.

1585
01:35:05,233 --> 01:35:07,302
Great.

1586
01:35:07,335 --> 01:35:10,839
Hector, have a great time!

Hello, Hector.

1594
01:36:42,064 --> 01:36:43,431
You made it.

1595
01:36:43,465 --> 01:36:45,433
The kids are just coming.

1596
01:36:45,467 --> 01:36:48,436
They're not crazy about going
to the beach house,

1597
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:50,906
I should warn you.

1598
01:36:50,939 --> 01:36:52,908
I would have made other plans.

1599
01:36:52,941 --> 01:36:55,911
I thought this was
a good way to start,

1600
01:36:55,944 --> 01:36:57,312
but maybe it isn't.

1601
01:36:57,345 --> 01:36:59,447
You should be allowed
to make your own mistakes.

1602
01:36:59,481 --> 01:37:03,018
It's just for a couple of nights.
They can take it.

1603
01:37:03,051 --> 01:37:07,189
Check into a hotel
if it gets to be too bad.

1604
01:37:07,222 --> 01:37:09,391
They love room service.

Come on, guys. Let's go.

1606
01:37:11,259 --> 01:37:12,627
Your father's waiting.

1607
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:15,230
Here's where we'll be
if anything crops up.

1608
01:37:15,263 --> 01:37:17,632
Thanks for the break.

1609
01:37:17,665 --> 01:37:20,235
Maybe this is a little sudden for them.

1610
01:37:20,268 --> 01:37:22,637
I should come by
a couple of nights

1611
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:25,207
and get to know them that way.

1612
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:26,975
By Monday, you'll know them.

1613

You've grown.

Well, here he is--

Hi.

Well, you three have a good weekend.

If it gets too miserable
at the beach house,

1621
01:37:54,236 --> 01:37:56,604
your dad will take you to a hotel.

Good luck, Hector.

And it's Thomas.

But we called you Tom.

from the luncheon meats, huh?

What was wrong with that?

It's just kitchen towel.
It's paper.

1661

It's bleached,
and it wasn't recycled.

A good friend. Very close.

1688
01:41:00,722 --> 01:41:03,558
What about the flowers?

1689
01:41:03,591 --> 01:41:06,794
They look like they should
be delivered to somebody.

1690
01:41:06,828 --> 01:41:08,396
Is that your job?

1691
01:41:08,430 --> 01:41:10,165
Something like that.

1692
01:41:10,198 --> 01:41:12,367
I get it.

1693
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:15,270
But you're not going to.

1694
01:41:15,303 --> 01:41:17,705
Well, I forgot.

1695
01:41:17,739 --> 01:41:19,574
I was slightly distracted.

1696
01:41:19,607 --> 01:41:21,809
You know, that happens.

1697
01:41:21,843 --> 01:41:24,146
Now we're on the
wrong side of town.

1698
01:41:24,179 --> 01:41:25,180
That's it?

1699
01:41:25,213 --> 01:41:28,716
Yeah, that's it...
I guess.

1700
01:41:28,750 --> 01:41:30,084
I see.

1701
01:41:33,521 --> 01:41:35,790
You're not seeing me
at my best today.

1702
01:41:50,838 --> 01:41:53,408
[tv]
O.K., so you're an aquarius

1703
01:41:53,441 --> 01:41:55,343
on the cusp of pisces.

1704
01:41:55,377 --> 01:41:57,745
What can I do for you today?

1705
01:41:57,779 --> 01:41:59,347
I'm thinking about moving.

1706
01:41:59,381 --> 01:42:00,748
You're thinking about moving.

1707
01:42:00,782 --> 01:42:04,319
You mean out of your house?

1708
01:42:04,352 --> 01:42:06,321
Is that what you mean?

1709
01:42:06,354 --> 01:42:07,155
Far away.

1710
01:42:07,189 --> 01:42:09,424
Be as specific as you can.

1711
01:42:09,457 --> 01:42:12,427
Hone in on the problem
that you have.

1712
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:15,430
I'm thinking about moving
to California, Rob.

1713
01:42:15,463 --> 01:42:18,433
Let's see what the stones
say about that.

1714
01:42:18,466 --> 01:42:21,436
I can see a move to California.

1715
01:42:21,469 --> 01:42:23,838
The stones are
a little tentative,

1716
01:42:23,871 --> 01:42:25,240
and they're wanting to know

1717
01:42:25,273 --> 01:42:28,410
why you want to move
to California.

1718
01:42:28,443 --> 01:42:31,413
We passed the fun fair last night.

1719
01:42:31,446 --> 01:42:33,781
Why don't we take a walk there today?

1720
01:42:33,815 --> 01:42:35,650
We don't go to fun fairs.

1721
01:42:35,683 --> 01:42:37,652
Let's just take a walk.

1722
01:42:37,685 --> 01:42:40,388
I brought some books.

1723
01:42:40,422 --> 01:42:43,391
I want to stay home and read.

1724
01:42:43,425 --> 01:42:46,160
No. Let's take a walk.

1725
01:42:47,762 --> 01:42:49,431
All right?

1726
01:42:49,464 --> 01:42:50,432
Fine.

1727
01:42:50,465 --> 01:42:51,533
Good.

1728
01:42:53,568 --> 01:42:54,936
Don't tell me-- Donald.

1729
01:42:54,969 --> 01:42:56,271
Yep.

1730
01:42:56,304 --> 01:42:59,807
In a gale, it just about
powers the radio.

1731
01:42:59,841 --> 01:43:03,678
It seems to want to make
the house fly at the same time.

1732
01:43:03,711 --> 01:43:05,813
What are you doing?

1733
01:43:05,847 --> 01:43:07,815
This is a metal detector.

1734
01:43:07,849 --> 01:43:09,984
Donald give you that?

1735
01:43:10,017 --> 01:43:10,785
Yep.

1736
01:43:10,818 --> 01:43:12,920
He's a regular mr. Wizard-- Donald.

1737
01:43:12,954 --> 01:43:15,790
I guess you could say that.

1738
01:43:20,395 --> 01:43:21,896
Donald's shoes leak.

1739
01:43:29,837 --> 01:43:32,507
O.K., give me $10 worth.

1740
01:43:35,777 --> 01:43:37,945
Here you go.
Thank you.

1741
01:43:37,979 --> 01:43:38,946
Thank you.

1742
01:43:38,980 --> 01:43:42,617
Well, let's go.
Let's go have fun.

1743
01:43:45,653 --> 01:43:47,622
Both of Donald's shoes leak.

1744
01:43:47,655 --> 01:43:50,625
Hey, let's go on the ferris wheel.

1745
01:43:50,658 --> 01:43:52,026
It makes me sick.

1746
01:43:52,059 --> 01:43:55,697
How about the bumper cars?
Those are great.

1747
01:43:57,299 --> 01:43:58,300
No.

1748
01:43:58,333 --> 01:43:59,367
No.

1749
01:43:59,401 --> 01:44:02,870
O.K. Hey, look, a roller coaster.
How about that?

1750
01:44:02,904 --> 01:44:03,871
Nah.

1751
01:44:03,905 --> 01:44:05,540
No.

1752
01:44:05,573 --> 01:44:08,543
I don't want to waste these tickets.

1753
01:44:08,576 --> 01:44:09,944
Let's go on this.

1754
01:44:09,977 --> 01:44:11,346
Three, please.

1755
01:44:13,448 --> 01:44:14,816
Here you go, bets.

1756
01:44:14,849 --> 01:44:16,418
The seats are wet.

1757
01:44:16,451 --> 01:44:18,820
Didn't count on a kitchen towel.

1758
01:44:18,853 --> 01:44:19,821
Unbleached, biodegradable,

1759
01:44:19,854 --> 01:44:21,723
and recyclable dry seats.

1760
01:44:21,756 --> 01:44:24,292
Huh? Ha ha ha.

1761
01:44:30,465 --> 01:44:31,633
Here you go, Thomas.

1762
01:44:32,734 --> 01:44:34,369
Thanks.

1763
01:45:13,441 --> 01:45:14,809
This is ridiculous.

1764
01:45:14,842 --> 01:45:16,944
Let's go someplace and talk, O.K.?

1765
01:45:16,978 --> 01:45:20,448
All right. If you want to.

1766
01:45:20,482 --> 01:45:22,984
How do you land these things?

1767
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:28,089
Lots of people get divorced.

1768
01:45:28,122 --> 01:45:29,691
Doesn't mean they disappear.

1769
01:45:29,724 --> 01:45:31,058
You're right.

1770
01:45:32,527 --> 01:45:34,896
After that, I went kind of crazy...

1771
01:45:34,929 --> 01:45:36,498
for a long time.

1772
01:45:36,531 --> 01:45:39,834
I did come to see you a couple
of times. You remember?

1773
01:45:39,867 --> 01:45:40,835
No.

1774
01:45:40,868 --> 01:45:42,036
Not really.

1775
01:45:42,069 --> 01:45:43,871
It wasn't very easy.

1776
01:45:43,905 --> 01:45:46,474
She and Donald happened so quickly.

1777
01:45:46,508 --> 01:45:47,575
I missed you terribly.

1778
01:45:47,609 --> 01:45:49,577
I thought I should stay away

1779
01:45:49,611 --> 01:45:51,846
until your mother got settled.

1780
01:45:51,879 --> 01:45:53,715
That's not the truth.

1781
01:45:53,748 --> 01:45:56,117
I missed you, but I was still crazy.

1782
01:45:56,150 --> 01:45:57,719
We got married so young.

1783
01:45:57,752 --> 01:46:00,154
All that freedom went to my head.

1784
01:46:00,187 --> 01:46:02,156
Then you moved to New Jersey.

1785
01:46:02,189 --> 01:46:05,092
It's 40 minutes away on a slow bus.

1786
01:46:05,126 --> 01:46:05,960
You're right.

1787
01:46:05,993 --> 01:46:09,096
Not too many excuses
for the first year.

1788
01:46:09,130 --> 01:46:10,698
The second, it's easier.

1789
01:46:10,732 --> 01:46:12,400
I was in jail.

1790
01:46:12,434 --> 01:46:14,869
What for?

1791
01:46:16,070 --> 01:46:19,040
I was working for the government
doing big contracts.

1792
01:46:19,073 --> 01:46:23,044
There's a lot of money in that...
and a lot of temptations.

1793
01:46:23,077 --> 01:46:27,048
My boss asked me to juggle
a couple of papers.

1794
01:46:27,081 --> 01:46:29,651
I did, and I got caught,

1795
01:46:29,684 --> 01:46:32,654
and I had to testify against him.

1796
01:46:32,687 --> 01:46:35,790
It was like killing somebody.

1797
01:46:36,991 --> 01:46:39,961
Well, Thomas wanted
to visit you in jail,

1798
01:46:39,994 --> 01:46:41,963
but mom wouldn't let him.

1799
01:46:41,996 --> 01:46:42,797
You did?

1800
01:46:42,830 --> 01:46:45,199
We didn't even know
when you got out.

1801
01:46:45,232 --> 01:46:47,535
I wasn't in great shape,

1802
01:46:47,569 --> 01:46:50,538
and I didn't want you
to see me like that.

1803
01:46:50,572 --> 01:46:52,940
I went back to work in real estate

1804
01:46:52,974 --> 01:46:55,777
with this guy I met in jail.

1805
01:46:55,810 --> 01:46:58,680
He's a good guy.
He's a good man, really.

1806
01:46:58,713 --> 01:47:01,683
He's my partner,
but he's also my friend.

1807
01:47:01,716 --> 01:47:03,050
What about your girlfriend?

1808
01:47:03,084 --> 01:47:04,085
Anna...

1809
01:47:04,118 --> 01:47:05,453
Oh...

1810
01:47:06,554 --> 01:47:07,522
She's nice.

1811
01:47:07,555 --> 01:47:09,891
She can't wait to see you guys.

1812
01:47:09,924 --> 01:47:12,894
She likes flowers.
Well, you know that.

1813
01:47:12,927 --> 01:47:15,062
Monday she'll probably kill me.

1814
01:47:15,096 --> 01:47:19,467
So you haven't been
staying away because of us?

1815
01:47:20,768 --> 01:47:22,436
What do you mean?

1816
01:47:23,971 --> 01:47:26,908
Is that what you think,
I was avoiding you two?

1817
01:47:28,175 --> 01:47:31,178
You mustn't think that, all right?

1818
01:47:33,848 --> 01:47:36,684
That's terrible, uh...

1819
01:47:39,186 --> 01:47:41,155
I left you two, didn't I?

1820
01:47:41,188 --> 01:47:43,190
I left you all alone.

1821
01:47:45,793 --> 01:47:47,862
We weren't all alone.

1822
01:48:05,212 --> 01:48:07,749
The rain stopped. You want to go?

1823
01:48:07,782 --> 01:48:09,183
I didn't leave

1824
01:48:09,216 --> 01:48:12,186
because it was two days
before your swimming test.

1825
01:48:12,219 --> 01:48:15,790
It was just a day
your mother and I decided.

1826
01:48:15,823 --> 01:48:17,191
But you weren't there.

1827
01:48:17,224 --> 01:48:18,192
I'm sorry.

1828
01:48:18,225 --> 01:48:20,695
It doesn't matter.
It's all right.

1829
01:48:20,728 --> 01:48:22,096
How'd you do?

1830
01:48:22,129 --> 01:48:23,097
I passed.

1831
01:48:23,130 --> 01:48:25,032
I'm a lifesaver now.

1832
01:48:28,570 --> 01:48:31,806
Thomas, come on!
We're going to have a barbecue.

1833
01:48:31,839 --> 01:48:34,041
Betsy said I could have steak.

1834
01:48:34,075 --> 01:48:35,643
Hurry up, Tom.

1835
01:48:35,677 --> 01:48:37,545
Not supposed to call him Tom.

1836
01:48:37,579 --> 01:48:38,546
I'm allowed.

1837
01:48:38,580 --> 01:48:39,446
You are?

1838
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:43,551
Always so far away.
How can I get to him?

1839
01:48:43,585 --> 01:48:44,619
It's easy.

1840
01:48:44,652 --> 01:48:47,021
All he wants is a hug.

1841
01:48:47,054 --> 01:48:48,623
No. That's not all.

1842
01:48:48,656 --> 01:48:51,626
He's been talking about it all week.

1843
01:48:51,659 --> 01:48:53,027
When he was little,

1844
01:48:53,060 --> 01:48:55,797
you'd squeeze him so hard
he couldn't breathe.

1845
01:48:58,866 --> 01:49:01,235
He said, "I bet dad'll do it

1846
01:49:01,268 --> 01:49:04,238
when he comes to pick us up...

1847
01:49:04,271 --> 01:49:06,173
on Friday."

1848
01:49:13,347 --> 01:49:16,317
When your mother and I split up,

1849
01:49:16,350 --> 01:49:18,686
She said,
"Don't lose the children."

1850
01:49:20,888 --> 01:49:23,257
Didn't mean much at the time.

1851
01:49:23,290 --> 01:49:24,959
She was right.

1852
01:49:26,894 --> 01:49:29,864
Who said I'd let you eat a steak?

1853
01:49:29,897 --> 01:49:32,266
I thought I could get that by you.

1854
01:49:32,299 --> 01:49:33,267
Hey, sport.

1855
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:34,869
Look what I found.

1856
01:49:34,902 --> 01:49:37,038
This is pretty neat.

1857
01:49:37,071 --> 01:49:38,706
[together] What is it?

1858
01:49:41,709 --> 01:49:43,077
Keep it.

1859
01:49:43,110 --> 01:49:45,246
Yeah, thanks.

1860
01:49:48,916 --> 01:49:51,285
It was nice talking to you, finally.

1861
01:49:51,318 --> 01:49:53,054
Mmm, me, too.

1862
01:49:54,188 --> 01:49:57,692
She was sitting behind me.
This incredible perfume.

1863
01:49:57,725 --> 01:50:02,096
I'd been in jail nearly two years
with 400 sweating males.

1864
01:50:02,129 --> 01:50:05,700
She got off the train,
and I followed her.

1865
01:50:05,733 --> 01:50:07,702
That's how good she is.

1866
01:50:07,735 --> 01:50:12,106
She listened to a bum who
followed her off the train.

1867
01:50:12,139 --> 01:50:14,709
I guess I'm lucky with women.

1868
01:50:14,742 --> 01:50:17,111
[chuckles] I should say.

1869
01:50:17,144 --> 01:50:19,113
Mom, Anna...

1870
01:50:19,146 --> 01:50:19,914
You.

1871
01:50:19,947 --> 01:50:23,117
Well, I might not be such a pushover.

1872
01:50:23,150 --> 01:50:24,285
Yeah?

1873
01:50:31,893 --> 01:50:33,260
No, it's mostly roses.

1874
01:50:33,294 --> 01:50:36,964
The azaleas go all the
way around the outside.

1875
01:50:36,998 --> 01:50:39,801
$12 each? Make it 32.

1876
01:50:39,834 --> 01:50:40,634
Two dozen.

1877
01:50:40,668 --> 01:50:43,805
What are eight more roses going to do?

1878
01:50:43,838 --> 01:50:44,939
Biggest basket you have.

1879
01:50:44,972 --> 01:50:47,308
Must be delivered tonight.

1880
01:50:47,341 --> 01:50:53,715
It says, "A lifetime of love
from Stasia, Andros."

1881
01:50:53,748 --> 01:50:55,216
Dad, your credit card.

1882
01:50:55,249 --> 01:50:58,219
They need the credit card.
Just get it.

1883
01:50:58,252 --> 01:51:00,254
Hurry up.

1884
01:51:00,287 --> 01:51:05,259
"Melanie, little Melanie,
Alex, little Alex--"

1885
01:51:05,292 --> 01:51:07,261
I thought he was taller.

1886
01:51:07,294 --> 01:51:09,263
It's been a while. You're bigger.

1887
01:51:09,296 --> 01:51:11,265
I guess so.

1888
01:51:11,298 --> 01:51:12,867
He has gotten fat, though.

1889
01:51:12,900 --> 01:51:15,269
Think of all the junk he must eat.

1890
01:51:15,302 --> 01:51:17,905
Bet I could beat him
at the front crawl now.

1891
01:51:23,210 --> 01:51:25,179
So, with his family

1892
01:51:25,212 --> 01:51:28,215
and warmed by
the very thought of a fire

1893
01:51:28,249 --> 01:51:29,450
he'd built for himself,

1894
01:51:29,483 --> 01:51:33,888
the man seemed to feel
something in his heart ease.

1895
01:51:33,921 --> 01:51:35,790
What was it?

1896
01:51:35,823 --> 01:51:38,359
He looked out on the world,

1897
01:51:38,392 --> 01:51:41,062
the only one he would ever know,

1898
01:51:41,095 --> 01:51:42,764
and wondered.

1899
01:51:59,313 --> 01:52:01,282
Dad!

1900
01:52:01,315 --> 01:52:02,516
Dad!

1901
01:52:02,549 --> 01:52:04,118
The boat's stuck!

1902
01:52:04,151 --> 01:52:06,754
It's filled with water!
I can't move!

1903
01:52:06,788 --> 01:52:07,554
Help! Help!

1904
01:52:07,588 --> 01:52:10,925
Come on in, Thomas! That's not safe.

1905
01:52:10,958 --> 01:52:13,928
I just found you.
I don't want to lose you.

1906
01:52:13,961 --> 01:52:15,930
Your mother would kill me.

1907
01:52:15,963 --> 01:52:18,332
Throw me the rope. Throw it!

1908
01:52:20,401 --> 01:52:22,269
That's one useless piece of rope.

1909
01:52:23,838 --> 01:52:24,806
[laughing]

1910
01:52:24,839 --> 01:52:25,807
Come on.

1911
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:26,941
Oh...

1912
01:52:46,828 --> 01:52:49,096
Why does it always go so fast?

1913
01:52:49,130 --> 01:52:53,034
Just when I'm ready to
put the sun in, it's gone.

1914
01:52:54,168 --> 01:52:56,537
Hurry up, dad. I'm still wet.

1915
01:52:56,570 --> 01:52:57,538
Huh?

1916
01:52:57,571 --> 01:53:00,141
She even gets angry at the sun.

1917
01:53:00,174 --> 01:53:02,143
What chance do we have?

1918
01:53:02,176 --> 01:53:04,812
I used to know how to do this.

1919
01:53:04,846 --> 01:53:05,813
Oh, yeah?

1920
01:53:05,847 --> 01:53:08,215
I was really good at this.

1921
01:53:08,249 --> 01:53:10,017
Come on.

1922
01:53:14,388 --> 01:53:16,958
That's the smell of civilization--
scorched meat.

1923
01:53:16,991 --> 01:53:18,359
You can have a steak.

1924
01:53:18,392 --> 01:53:20,361
I'll have a piece of chicken.

1925
01:53:20,394 --> 01:53:22,029
Have some meat.

1926
01:53:22,063 --> 01:53:23,965
O.K.

1927
01:53:25,900 --> 01:53:28,569
I forgot that--how he eats,
how dedicated he is.

1928
01:53:28,602 --> 01:53:30,104
It's like his religion.

1929
01:53:30,137 --> 01:53:31,305
Things I like.

1930
01:53:31,338 --> 01:53:33,908
You used to hum while you ate,

1931
01:53:33,941 --> 01:53:36,310
like everything
was fine in the world.

1932
01:53:36,343 --> 01:53:39,246
I forgot about that.
It feels good.

1933
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:40,347
[humming]

1934
01:53:40,381 --> 01:53:41,883
The weekend's turning out fine.

1935
01:53:41,916 --> 01:53:42,884
Relax.

1936
01:53:42,917 --> 01:53:44,151
I am.

1937
01:53:46,187 --> 01:53:47,588
I will.

1938
01:53:47,621 --> 01:53:48,856
Yeah.

1939
01:53:53,594 --> 01:53:55,196
Hey, Thomas, look.

1940
01:53:55,229 --> 01:53:56,597
There's old Mercury.

1941
01:53:56,630 --> 01:53:58,599
Remember?
We used to watch stars.

1942
01:53:58,632 --> 01:54:01,068
You could name all the planets.

1943
01:54:01,102 --> 01:54:03,938
You could recite them like in a poem.

1944
01:54:03,971 --> 01:54:06,340
You'd sit up in that little window.

1945
01:54:06,373 --> 01:54:07,374
You remember?

1946
01:54:07,408 --> 01:54:08,375
No.

1947
01:54:08,409 --> 01:54:10,111
And that's Saturn.

1948
01:54:10,144 --> 01:54:10,912
Sorry.

1949
01:54:10,945 --> 01:54:14,015
Glad you kept up with your astronomy.

1950
01:54:14,048 --> 01:54:15,416
That's real good.

1951
01:54:15,449 --> 01:54:18,019
I'm not into stargazing so much.

1952
01:54:18,052 --> 01:54:19,053
At school,

1953
01:54:19,086 --> 01:54:21,022
we're working on a computer
model of a biosphere

1954
01:54:21,055 --> 01:54:23,157
for deep space travel.

1955
01:54:24,926 --> 01:54:27,094
Everything's going to be O.K.

1956
01:54:27,128 --> 01:54:29,630
What do you mean, "going to be"?

1957
01:54:29,663 --> 01:54:31,298
This is it.

1958
01:54:31,332 --> 01:54:32,399
What?

1959
01:54:32,433 --> 01:54:35,302
This is as good as it gets.

1960
01:54:35,336 --> 01:54:38,372
This might be the best
moment of your life.

1961
01:54:38,405 --> 01:54:40,307
How much better do you want it?

1962
01:54:40,341 --> 01:54:41,308
Not much.

1963
01:54:41,342 --> 01:54:43,144
Enjoy it.

1964
01:54:43,177 --> 01:54:45,312
Thanks for the tip.

1965
01:54:45,346 --> 01:54:47,915
I will.

1966
01:54:47,949 --> 01:54:52,253
But they say the universe
might be like a piece of string

1967
01:54:52,286 --> 01:54:54,255
with the ends in a knot,

1968
01:54:54,288 --> 01:54:56,023
so infinity isn't really infinity.

1969
01:54:56,057 --> 01:54:58,659
When did he become Einstein?

1970
01:54:58,692 --> 01:55:00,161
Be quiet, Einstein.

1971
01:55:00,194 --> 01:55:03,564
Come up here. Your dad
wants to hug you to death.

1972
01:55:03,597 --> 01:55:05,166
That's been a while.

1973
01:55:05,199 --> 01:55:07,701
Wait till I finish my chicken.

1974
01:55:07,734 --> 01:55:09,270
I'm almost done.

1975
01:55:09,303 --> 01:55:10,271
You're amazing.

1976
01:55:10,304 --> 01:55:12,439
You'll get used to it.

1977
01:55:14,575 --> 01:55:15,542
Hey, Thomas,

1978
01:55:15,576 --> 01:55:17,111
don't worry about infinity.

1979
01:55:17,144 --> 01:55:18,980
Know what that is out there?

1980
01:55:19,013 --> 01:55:22,984
A big black sheet with holes
poked in it to let light through.

1981
01:55:23,017 --> 01:55:25,052
That's the latest.
That's what I heard.

1982
01:55:25,086 --> 01:55:28,055
The whole universe
is inside a speck of dust

1983
01:55:28,089 --> 01:55:29,456
in a ball of fluff

1984
01:55:29,490 --> 01:55:32,326
in the cuff of a pair of pants

1985
01:55:32,359 --> 01:55:35,362
hanging over the back of a chair.

1986
01:55:35,396 --> 01:55:38,532
That's not it.
You know what it is really?

1987
01:55:38,565 --> 01:55:41,302
The whole thing is
actually stars, planets.

1988
01:55:41,335 --> 01:55:44,305
Everything is on the skin
of a bubble of milk

1989
01:55:44,338 --> 01:55:45,706
that's about to pop.

1990
01:55:45,739 --> 01:55:47,708
It's in a bowl of cornflakes

1991
01:55:47,741 --> 01:55:49,143
that someone's about to eat.

1992
01:55:49,176 --> 01:55:49,943
Skim milk.

1993
01:55:49,977 --> 01:55:52,379
You don't get bubbles on skim milk.

1994
01:55:52,413 --> 01:55:54,081
Don't be so logical.

1995
01:55:54,115 --> 01:55:55,649
Don't be so unscientific.

1996
01:55:59,020 --> 01:56:01,355
I finished my chicken.

1997
01:56:09,763 --> 01:56:11,999
[Thomas giggling]

1998
01:56:16,437 --> 01:56:17,338
Whoa!

1999
01:56:17,371 --> 01:56:20,407
Don't squeeze him so hard
he can't breathe.

2000
01:56:20,441 --> 01:56:24,378
See? Come here. Sit down.

2001
01:56:31,385 --> 01:56:33,354
I've got a better one.

2002
01:56:33,387 --> 01:56:35,756
Well, we're all inside
a speck of pollen

2003
01:56:35,789 --> 01:56:38,359
stuck to the wing of a bee.

2004
01:56:38,392 --> 01:56:39,360
That's good.

2005
01:56:39,393 --> 01:56:41,362
The bee's sitting on a flower.

2006
01:56:41,395 --> 01:56:43,364
Don't mention flowers,
Betsy, please. O.k.?

2007
01:56:43,397 --> 01:56:44,365
Sorry.

2008
01:56:44,398 --> 01:56:46,033
It's all right.
