01:25:55,151 --> 01:25:58,780
The communicator?

1013
01:25:58,854 --> 01:26:01,755
Is it still working?

1014
01:26:01,824 --> 01:26:04,884
It's doing something.

1015
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,757
What?

1016
01:26:06,829 --> 01:26:10,128
I really
shouldn't tell.

1017
01:26:10,199 --> 01:26:12,633
He came to me.

1018
01:26:12,701 --> 01:26:16,102
He came to me.

1019
01:26:16,172 --> 01:26:19,608
Elliott,
he came to me, too.

1020
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:21,609
I've been
wishing for this

1021
01:26:21,677 --> 01:26:24,111
since I was
10 years old.

1022
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:26,614
I don't want him
to die.

1023
01:26:26,682 --> 01:26:30,277
What can we do that
we're not already doing?

1024
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:35,085
He needs to go home.

1025
01:26:35,157 --> 01:26:38,752
He's calling
his people...

1026
01:26:38,827 --> 01:26:43,389
and I don't know
where they are.

1027
01:26:43,465 --> 01:26:46,161
He needs to go home.

1028
01:26:46,235 --> 01:26:47,998
Elliott, I don't think

1029
01:26:48,070 --> 01:26:50,766
that he was left here
intentionally.

1030
01:26:53,242 --> 01:26:57,144
But his being here
is a miracle, Elliott.

1031
01:26:57,213 --> 01:27:00,182
It's a miracle,

1032
01:27:00,249 --> 01:27:03,844
and you did the best
that anybody could do.

1033
01:27:06,722 --> 01:27:09,350
I'm glad
he met you first.

1034
01:27:18,801 --> 01:27:19,733
He's got DNA.

1035
01:27:19,802 --> 01:27:21,201
Incredible.

1036
01:27:21,270 --> 01:27:22,737
He's got DNA!

1037
01:27:22,771 --> 01:27:25,001
He doesn't have
four nucleotides like we do.

1038
01:27:25,074 --> 01:27:27,542
He has six.
Desynchronization
of the two brain waves.

1039
01:27:30,613 --> 01:27:31,545
E.T.!

1040
01:27:31,614 --> 01:27:33,582
The boy's condition
is stabilizing.

1041
01:27:33,649 --> 01:27:35,173
Blood pressure's
back up.

1042
01:27:36,752 --> 01:27:39,084
E.T.

1043
01:27:39,154 --> 01:27:41,645
Elliott.

1044
01:27:41,724 --> 01:27:43,385
He's speaking.
He's talking.

1045
01:27:43,459 --> 01:27:45,586
E.T...

1046
01:27:45,661 --> 01:27:48,323
stay with me.

1047
01:27:49,832 --> 01:27:51,026
Please.

1048
01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:53,261
Stay...

1049
01:27:53,335 --> 01:27:54,666
Together.

1050
01:27:54,737 --> 01:27:58,434
I'll be right here.

1051
01:27:58,507 --> 01:28:01,840
I'll be right here.

1052
01:28:03,512 --> 01:28:06,072
Stay...

1053
01:28:06,148 --> 01:28:10,915
Elliott.

1054
01:28:10,986 --> 01:28:13,011
Stay.

1055
01:28:14,189 --> 01:28:16,487
Stay.

1056
01:28:18,727 --> 01:28:22,629
Stay.

1057
01:28:22,698 --> 01:28:25,098
Stay.

1058
01:28:25,167 --> 01:28:27,863
The creature's pressure
is bottoming out.

1059
01:28:27,936 --> 01:28:29,267
How's the boy?

1060
01:28:29,338 --> 01:28:32,705
He's converting back
to normal sinus rhythm.

1061
01:28:34,143 --> 01:28:35,075
They're separating.

1062
01:28:35,144 --> 01:28:37,442
Boy and creature
are separating.

1063
01:28:37,513 --> 01:28:38,946
What does
that mean?

1064
01:28:39,014 --> 01:28:41,414
The boy's coming back.
We're losing E.T.

1065
01:28:41,483 --> 01:28:45,510
E.T., answer me, please.

1066
01:28:45,587 --> 01:28:47,214
Please.

1067
01:28:47,289 --> 01:28:49,257
Just relax.

1068
01:29:56,925 --> 01:29:58,290
No!

1069
01:29:58,360 --> 01:29:59,918
E.T., don't go!

1070
01:29:59,995 --> 01:30:01,394
No blood pressure.

1071
01:30:01,463 --> 01:30:03,897
He's got no pulse
or respiration.

1072
01:30:03,966 --> 01:30:06,901
We can't
get a pulse
or blood pressure.

1073
01:30:06,969 --> 01:30:09,335
It doesn't look
like he's breathing.

1074
01:30:09,405 --> 01:30:11,771
[Groaning]

1075
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,637
Leave him alone!

1076
01:30:13,709 --> 01:30:15,768
You're killing him!

1077
01:30:15,844 --> 01:30:17,277
Leave him alone!

1078
01:30:17,346 --> 01:30:19,177
Let's move it!

1079
01:30:19,248 --> 01:30:21,307
Get the boy out.

1080
01:30:21,383 --> 01:30:23,681
Stop it!
You're killing him!

1081
01:30:23,752 --> 01:30:25,481
You're killing him!

1082
01:30:25,554 --> 01:30:27,613
Let's go.
Move it out.

1083
01:30:27,689 --> 01:30:30,123
You're killing him!
You're killing him!

1084
01:30:30,192 --> 01:30:33,525
You're killing him!
He came to me!

1085
01:30:33,595 --> 01:30:35,586
Let's ventilate him.
Any pulses?

1086
01:30:35,664 --> 01:30:36,790
Move it.

1087
01:30:36,865 --> 01:30:38,765
He came to me!

1088
01:30:38,834 --> 01:30:39,926
Let's start.

1089
01:30:40,002 --> 01:30:41,697
60 per minute.

1090
01:30:44,339 --> 01:30:45,897
Minimal breath sounds.

1091
01:30:45,974 --> 01:30:48,966
Calm down.
Calm down. Calm...

1092
01:30:50,879 --> 01:30:52,471
Let's try some
bertyllium.

1093
01:30:52,548 --> 01:30:54,516
Can we have
some bertyllium?

1094
01:30:54,583 --> 01:30:56,175
Getting a pulse?

1095
01:30:56,251 --> 01:30:57,275
5 milligrams.

1096
01:30:57,352 --> 01:30:59,650
Compressed air.
Compressed air's fine.

1097
01:30:59,721 --> 01:31:01,586
Thank you.

1098
01:31:01,657 --> 01:31:03,215
All IV push.

1099
01:31:03,292 --> 01:31:05,055
He's not ventilating.

1100
01:31:05,127 --> 01:31:08,153
His pupils are fixed
and dilated.

1101
01:31:08,230 --> 01:31:09,197
More drugs.

1102
01:31:09,264 --> 01:31:10,162
Quiet.

1103
01:31:10,232 --> 01:31:12,132
Defibrillate him.

1104
01:31:12,201 --> 01:31:14,362
Losing him.
We're losing him.

1105
01:31:14,436 --> 01:31:15,869
Let's go.

1106
01:31:15,938 --> 01:31:17,405
Everybody stand clear.

1107
01:31:17,473 --> 01:31:18,440
Clear.

1108
01:31:18,507 --> 01:31:20,202
We're losing him.

1109
01:31:20,275 --> 01:31:21,902
One more time.

1110
01:31:23,512 --> 01:31:24,410
Quiet!

1111
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:25,947
It's still defib.

1112
01:31:26,014 --> 01:31:27,447
OK, let's go.

1113
01:31:27,516 --> 01:31:29,040
Let's go.
Let's go.

1114
01:31:34,857 --> 01:31:36,916
Elliott?

1115
01:31:38,694 --> 01:31:39,922
Mom.

1116
01:31:51,406 --> 01:31:53,874
He needs calcium
in his body.

1117
01:31:53,942 --> 01:31:55,637
Let's continue CPR,
please.

1118
01:32:11,193 --> 01:32:13,218
Would you people
stand back?

1119
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:20,134
Something's
happening.

1120
01:32:20,202 --> 01:32:22,170
Ooh, they're
going to die.

1121
01:32:22,237 --> 01:32:23,636
Shut up, Greg.

1122
01:32:23,705 --> 01:32:25,570
Something is
definitely happening.

1123
01:32:25,641 --> 01:32:27,040
Anybody have
any ideas?

1124
01:32:27,109 --> 01:32:29,009
EEG's flat.
EKG's flat.

1125
01:32:29,077 --> 01:32:31,545
OK, I'm going
to call it.

1126
01:32:31,613 --> 01:32:33,012
I think he's dead.

1127
01:32:33,081 --> 01:32:34,514
No. I don't know.

1128
01:32:34,583 --> 01:32:36,551
What time
do you have?

1129
01:32:36,618 --> 01:32:37,516
15:36.

1130
01:32:37,586 --> 01:32:40,111
15 hours,
36 minutes.

1131
01:32:40,188 --> 01:32:41,655
O.K.

1132
01:32:41,723 --> 01:32:43,987
Let's pack him in ice.

1133
01:32:45,527 --> 01:32:46,858
Let's leave.

1134
01:33:52,861 --> 01:33:56,058
Is he dead, mama?

1135
01:33:56,131 --> 01:33:58,224
I think so,
sweetheart.

1136
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:02,236
Can we wish
for him to come back?

1137
01:34:02,304 --> 01:34:04,238
Yeah.

1138
01:34:04,306 --> 01:34:06,433
I wish.

1139
01:34:06,508 --> 01:34:08,499
I wish, too.

1140
01:34:17,219 --> 01:34:18,652
Come on, Gert.

1141
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:21,621
We'll wait for Elliott
in the front room.

1142
01:34:23,291 --> 01:34:24,849
Cardiac arrest
was terminated

1143
01:34:24,926 --> 01:34:28,225
at 1500 hours
and 36 minutes.

1144
01:34:28,296 --> 01:34:31,129
He received
intravenous
lidocaine,

1145
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:32,666
intravenous
epinephrine

1146
01:34:32,734 --> 01:34:34,167
on a lidocaine
drip,

1147
01:34:34,236 --> 01:34:36,761
2.7%
sodium-chloride
solution,

1148
01:34:36,838 --> 01:34:38,738
catheters from
the "A" line.

1149
01:34:38,807 --> 01:34:40,274
And the
intravenous line

1150
01:34:40,342 --> 01:34:43,209
should be sent
for culture.

1151
01:34:43,278 --> 01:34:45,712
He was monitored
with a...

1152
01:34:45,781 --> 01:34:49,114
EEG and an EKG,

1153
01:34:49,184 --> 01:34:51,015
he was
defibrillated.

1154
01:34:51,086 --> 01:34:54,021
They're going to have
to take him away now.

1155
01:34:54,089 --> 01:34:56,523
They'll just
cut him all up.

1156
01:34:56,591 --> 01:35:00,618
Would you like
to spend some time
alone with him?

1157
01:35:15,944 --> 01:35:19,744
Could we all step out
for a minute, please?

1158
01:36:13,335 --> 01:36:16,327
Look at what
they've done to you.

1159
01:36:19,207 --> 01:36:21,141
I'm so sorry.

1160
01:36:26,715 --> 01:36:29,149
You must be dead...

1161
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:32,279
because...

1162
01:36:32,354 --> 01:36:35,187
I don't know
how to feel.

1163
01:36:38,727 --> 01:36:41,252
I can't feel
anything anymore.

1164
01:36:43,698 --> 01:36:47,031
You've gone
someplace else now.

1165
01:36:54,376 --> 01:36:57,539
I'll believe in you
all my life.

1166
01:36:59,047 --> 01:37:00,674
Every day.

1167
01:37:05,253 --> 01:37:06,550
E.T...

1168
01:37:09,791 --> 01:37:11,315
I love you.

1169
01:37:42,490 --> 01:37:44,720
Oh, my God.

1170
01:37:51,066 --> 01:37:53,626
E.T. phone home.

1171
01:37:53,702 --> 01:37:55,602
Ah ha!

1172
01:37:55,670 --> 01:37:57,501
Phone home.

1173
01:37:57,572 --> 01:37:59,096
Phone home.

1174
01:37:59,174 --> 01:38:01,301
Does this mean
they're coming?

1175
01:38:01,376 --> 01:38:03,401
Yes.

1176

1185
01:38:16,391 --> 01:38:18,586

Elliott,
why don't you
come with me?

1201
01:38:47,289 --> 01:38:48,278
No.

1202

Why don't you
come with me?

1203

No.

No. No.

1206
01:38:54,062 --> 01:38:55,393
It's all right.

No!

1208
01:39:00,669 --> 01:39:02,637
Would you like
the flower?

1209
01:39:02,704 --> 01:39:04,035
Aah!

1210
01:39:07,409 --> 01:39:09,070
He's alive!

1211
01:39:09,144 --> 01:39:10,634
He's alive!

1212
01:39:10,712 --> 01:39:11,610
All right!

1213
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:13,477
It's glowing
right here.

1214
01:39:24,893 --> 01:39:26,861
Are they gone, mama?

1215
01:39:26,928 --> 01:39:28,327
Who's gone, honey?

1216
01:39:28,396 --> 01:39:29,488
The boys.

1217
01:39:29,564 --> 01:39:30,826
What boys?

1218
01:39:30,899 --> 01:39:35,336
I'm supposed to give you
this note when they're gone.

1219
01:39:35,403 --> 01:39:38,270
Give it to me now,
Gertie.

1220
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:47,575
Oh, my God.

1221
01:39:55,957 --> 01:39:58,482
Give me
a hand with this.

Aah!

1223

Where's your mask?

1224
01:40:07,702 --> 01:40:08,634
Back here.

1225
01:40:08,703 --> 01:40:10,637
Well, get it on!

1226
01:40:10,705 --> 01:40:12,002
I'm trying!

1227
01:40:17,412 --> 01:40:19,676
Hey, who are you?

1228
01:40:19,748 --> 01:40:21,682
I'm driving.

1229
01:40:23,618 --> 01:40:25,017
Open the door,
son.

1230
01:40:25,086 --> 01:40:27,350
Somebody's here.
What do I do?

1231
01:40:27,422 --> 01:40:30,880
What are you waiting for?
Let's go!

1232
01:40:30,959 --> 01:40:32,483
Let's get out of here!

1233
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:35,461
I've never driven
forward before!

1234

[Engine Starts]

1235
01:40:37,332 --> 01:40:38,526
Aah!

1236
01:40:42,937 --> 01:40:43,926
Get the bikes.

1237
01:40:44,005 --> 01:40:45,973
Meet us
at the playground

1238
01:40:46,041 --> 01:40:48,373
at the top
of the hill.

1239
01:41:08,396 --> 01:41:11,661
We'll all die,
and I'll never
get my license.

1240
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:16,603
Where's
the playground?

1241
01:41:16,671 --> 01:41:18,536
It's near the preschool!

1242
01:41:18,606 --> 01:41:19,630
Where's that?

1243
01:41:19,707 --> 01:41:21,072
I don't know streets.

1244
01:41:21,142 --> 01:41:23,133
Mom always drives me.

1245
01:41:23,211 --> 01:41:25,236
Son of a bitch.

1246
01:41:51,139 --> 01:41:52,367
Where are you going?

1247
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:53,771
To the spaceship.

1248
01:41:53,842 --> 01:41:54,934
Shh!

1249
01:41:55,009 --> 01:41:58,445
To the spaceship
to the moon.

1250
01:41:58,513 --> 01:41:59,537
Quiet!

1251
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:02,979
Oh, my God.

1252
01:42:03,051 --> 01:42:05,417
Stop the van!

1253
01:42:09,357 --> 01:42:10,984
Don't pull it off!

That did it!

01:43:13,254 --> 01:43:16,280
O.K. He's a man
from outer space,

1256
01:43:16,357 --> 01:43:19,019
and we're taking him
to his spaceship.

1257
01:43:19,093 --> 01:43:21,721
Well, can't he
just beam up?

1258
01:43:21,796 --> 01:43:23,855
This is reality,
Greg.

1259
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:27,099
Keep her back!

1260

No! No! No! No!

There's nobody here.

To the forest!

01:43:51,926 --> 01:43:53,257
Follow me!

1269
01:44:25,293 --> 01:44:27,625
We got them
at the hill.

This is Unit 302.
