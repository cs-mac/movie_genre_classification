1
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,934
Come on, Jeanne?

2
00:04:08,278 --> 00:04:09,654
Robert?

3
00:04:11,072 --> 00:04:15,076
Hello
Come, sit.

4
00:04:18,162 --> 00:04:19,601
Well

5
00:04:21,082 --> 00:04:26,254
Why do you want both
writing fiction?

6
00:04:28,131 --> 00:04:30,216
- You do not like?
- No.

7
00:04:30,466 --> 00:04:33,178
Sorry, but I prefer
be quite honest.

8
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:35,346
Not good.
Forget it.

9
00:04:37,432 --> 00:04:39,517
I want to write this story.

10
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:43,271
Listen, Jeanne, forget
stories, novels.

11
00:04:44,105 --> 00:04:46,608
Their biographies are remarkable.

12
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:49,068
His investigations
history is accurate.

13
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,738
Your guides are written
with imagination.

14
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:54,741
But that is not writing,
this is journalism.

15
00:04:54,782 --> 00:04:56,618
E?
So what?

16
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:59,412
I've had enough of that.
I want to write something else.

17
00:04:59,454 --> 00:05:02,332
- When I was little...
- In former times.

18
00:05:02,373 --> 00:05:05,001
Or change the subject.
This is a failure.

19
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,630
Why write about your childhood?

20
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:13,968
- She inspires me.
- It does not inspire, do not.

21
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:16,846
I'm not saying there's nothing there.

22
00:05:17,138 --> 00:05:19,307
Are single images.

23
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:23,269
Heroin notes
but lacks depth and emotion.

24
00:05:23,436 --> 00:05:28,525
Several details of the story
never become clear.

25
00:05:28,816 --> 00:05:31,152
These details are important.

26
00:05:31,236 --> 00:05:35,782
- I want very detailed descriptions.
- I know, Jeanne, I know.

27
00:05:35,823 --> 00:05:37,742
But it is very cold.

28
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,497
You do not make sufficient use
their memories.

29
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:43,936
I have no memory.

30
00:05:44,082 --> 00:05:46,668
I do not remember anything
before age 8.

31
00:05:47,168 --> 00:05:49,045
Sorry, I did not know.

32
00:05:50,213 --> 00:05:53,550
His mother and you...
never told me.

33
00:05:54,175 --> 00:05:56,010
- I do not understand...
- No matter.

34
00:05:56,135 --> 00:06:01,266
There are things and pictures.
Mom told me a lot.

35
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:06,187
The memory is not made of information,
but perceptions and emotions.

36
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:09,941
And that is precisely why
interests me.

37
00:06:10,191 --> 00:06:14,195
I must write about it
and rediscover my childhood.

38
00:06:14,237 --> 00:06:16,656
Something was lost in my life.

39
00:06:22,036 --> 00:06:23,475
Sure.

40
00:06:23,872 --> 00:06:25,707
Thanks for receiving me.

41
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:30,107
Jeanne?

42
00:06:34,382 --> 00:06:35,800
Jeanne?

43
00:06:37,844 --> 00:06:39,241
You okay?

44
00:06:41,514 --> 00:06:44,726
Yes..

45
00:08:02,929 --> 00:08:05,932
- Nadia?
- A.

46
00:08:08,935 --> 00:08:10,562
Three for me.

47
00:08:25,076 --> 00:08:26,661
Nadia, in turn.

48
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:28,997
1000.

49
00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:30,894
I will.

50
00:08:33,751 --> 00:08:37,714
His 1000 plus 3.

51
00:08:38,882 --> 00:08:40,383
I run.

52
00:08:44,929 --> 00:08:48,516
- More 1000.
- I bet it all.

53
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:50,977
Come on, kids.

54
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:53,938
Take your designs and pens and go.

55
00:08:54,314 --> 00:08:55,711
Jeanne?

56
00:08:56,357 --> 00:08:57,817
Nadia, you're playing?

57
00:08:57,859 --> 00:09:00,653
Wait, darling, I'm going.
I'm finished here.

58
00:09:01,654 --> 00:09:04,365
- Is he interested?
- No.

59
00:09:04,532 --> 00:09:05,929
Why?

60
00:09:07,577 --> 00:09:11,831
Many descriptions, facts and details.

61
00:09:12,373 --> 00:09:14,751
- What details?
- No matter.

62
00:09:17,629 --> 00:09:20,048
Let me read it and tell you what I think.

63
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:21,549
No, not yet.

64
00:09:21,925 --> 00:09:24,802
Why not start
with an autobiography?

65
00:09:25,136 --> 00:09:27,639
I read "Tales of Jeanne" for them.

66
00:09:28,181 --> 00:09:30,308
Mother, it was 30 years ago.

67
00:09:31,226 --> 00:09:34,354
That his father
and his brother?

68
00:09:34,979 --> 00:09:36,606
They were legal?

69
00:09:39,108 --> 00:09:42,070
Do not worry, honey.

70
00:09:42,111 --> 00:09:44,447
Nadia, you come from?

71
00:09:46,991 --> 00:09:50,870
- You can have dinner with me?
- I do not like to see you play.

72
00:09:50,912 --> 00:09:52,580
And I do not like your friends.

73
00:09:52,622 --> 00:09:54,624
- Let's go somewhere else.
- No.

74
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,167
I'm tired.

75
00:09:57,168 --> 00:10:00,672
You clear your hair?
It is more beautiful without it.

76
00:10:01,506 --> 00:10:05,385
- Bye, my dear.
- Bye, Grandma.

77
00:10:05,426 --> 00:10:07,053
I'll call you tonight.

78
00:10:16,437 --> 00:10:17,814
Coming.

79
00:10:25,196 --> 00:10:28,658
Robert is a fool.
Your book is great.

80
00:10:33,371 --> 00:10:36,791
I canceled my meeting / dinner.
We will spend time together.

81
00:10:38,376 --> 00:10:40,587
No, please, I hate it.
Stop.

82
00:10:41,004 --> 00:10:43,548
It's just for us
children will love.

83
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,966
In this case...

84
00:10:58,688 --> 00:11:00,440
<i>Smile, honey. </ i></i>

85
00:11:01,691 --> 00:11:03,067
Crap!

86
00:11:03,943 --> 00:11:06,696
It has a boy in school
who is afraid of apples.

87
00:11:06,905 --> 00:11:08,406
This is strange.

88
00:11:09,032 --> 00:11:11,159
Enough. Eat.

89
00:11:12,327 --> 00:11:16,372
- You are reading your books?
- Just taking a look.

90
00:11:16,497 --> 00:11:18,917
I had more imagination
old, no?

91
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:22,003
That's backwards.
Find inspiration in the present.

92
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:26,257
- Mom said the same thing.
- So maybe not a good idea.

93
00:11:34,807 --> 00:11:37,852
<i>can talk. 'm Filming. </ I></i>

94
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:42,190
Are you sure?
Will enslave us.

95
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:43,858
Only 5 minutes.

96
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,069
<i>Jeremie release his sister. </ i></i>

97
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:49,072
<i>not fight. </ i></i>

98
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:53,535
<i>Stop, do not like it. </ i></i>

99
00:11:54,786 --> 00:11:56,955
<i>Stop. </ i></i>

100
00:11:57,372 --> 00:11:59,082
It seems so stupid.

101
00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:16,224
What is this?
I'm tired or what?

102
00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:20,520
The table was moved.
Parallel to the window.

103
00:12:21,688 --> 00:12:23,898
As ever.

104
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:42,876
You changed the table.

105
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,632
Why have you changed the table?

106
00:12:49,674 --> 00:12:52,385
The table has always been so.

107
00:12:52,427 --> 00:12:56,222
No matter, as long as everything
return to its place.

108
00:12:59,642 --> 00:13:01,102
<i>Lea. </ i></i>

109
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:17,368
What are you doing?

110
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:33,384
What is this nonsense?

111
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,353
What are these words and these guys?

112
00:13:44,354 --> 00:13:47,273
I see nothing.
It's just a movie.

113
00:13:47,398 --> 00:13:49,776
You could laugh at least.

114
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,876
What is this?
For me?

115
00:14:06,918 --> 00:14:08,336
No.

116
00:14:13,174 --> 00:14:14,801
Did you like your movie?

117
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:18,096
Stop, do not like it.

118
00:14:19,472 --> 00:14:23,101
I let you work,
therefore deserve a small reward.

119
00:14:23,142 --> 00:14:25,645
I'll make a hot chocolate.

120
00:14:31,693 --> 00:14:33,069
Hi

121
00:14:33,111 --> 00:14:35,071
I could not wake her.

122
00:14:35,113 --> 00:14:37,866
- The board did not return to the place?
- What place?

123
00:14:37,991 --> 00:14:39,409
Do not start again.

124
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:43,288
I also have to say in how
things are placed in the kitchen, right?

125
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,920
Where's the honey?

126
00:14:53,298 --> 00:14:56,134
I'm warning you
everything has to go back to your place.

127
00:14:56,176 --> 00:15:01,055
I hope you have a good memory, because
I will not spend hours looking for things.

128
00:15:01,097 --> 00:15:04,434
No one changed anything.
He got on the wrong foot?

129
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:07,103
You can check my dick?

130
00:15:07,145 --> 00:15:09,939
I put it right
and I think he has changed.

131
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:11,378
Very funny.

132
00:15:17,655 --> 00:15:19,949
Jeremie, put your hands on the table.

133
00:15:23,578 --> 00:15:24,954
Coma.

134
00:15:25,914 --> 00:15:27,957
Lea, feels right.

135
00:15:45,517 --> 00:15:47,185
All you need in 27 days?

136
00:15:48,186 --> 00:15:50,647
Who are these gestures?

137
00:15:51,147 --> 00:15:53,233
Is someone in your presence?

138
00:15:53,274 --> 00:15:54,692
Are you crazy?

139
00:15:55,109 --> 00:15:58,154
Yes, of course.
I'm mad.

140
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,784
I'm a little lost
because of the table.

141
00:16:02,825 --> 00:16:05,036
- Easy, Jeanne.
- No.

142
00:16:07,372 --> 00:16:10,542
- This is hot.
- Sorry.

143
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,087
Give me that.

144
00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:18,508
Do not do these guys.

145
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:21,010
I'm tired.

146
00:16:21,052 --> 00:16:22,887
I'm tired, OK?

147
00:16:23,137 --> 00:16:25,139
We comb the hair.

148
00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:03,751
The birthday party was not bad.

149
00:21:05,003 --> 00:21:07,505
Do not move,
or you can cut.

150
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:10,258
I wonder
how others live.

151
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,803
Everything seems strange.
And I do not like his mother.

152
00:21:13,845 --> 00:21:17,724
It flattens my hair
and smells like eggs.

153
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:19,851
Raw eggs or fried?

154
00:21:21,352 --> 00:21:23,188
A little like ham.

155
00:21:34,824 --> 00:21:36,743
<i>not agree, but I'm listening. </ i></i>

156
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,457
<i>Let's do something. </ i></i>

157
00:21:43,082 --> 00:21:44,501
<i>I'll do something. </ i></i>

158
00:21:45,752 --> 00:21:47,504
<i>fictitious. </ i></i>

159
00:21:48,129 --> 00:21:50,215
<i>To obtain the license. </ i></i>

160
00:21:52,842 --> 00:21:54,928
<i>also will go to prison for killing him. </ i></i>

161
00:21:55,261 --> 00:21:58,681
<i>I'm losing time
customers and patience. </ i></i>

162
00:22:01,184 --> 00:22:03,228
<i>He is incompetent. </ i></i>

163
00:22:03,394 --> 00:22:06,105
<i>He's looking for me,
for us, and he will find. </ i></i>

164
00:22:06,147 --> 00:22:07,503
What?

165
00:22:08,399 --> 00:22:09,776
Nothing.

166
00:22:10,652 --> 00:22:12,028
Go.

167
00:23:08,209 --> 00:23:12,380
This trainee is a bag.
I swear I'll beat him.

168
00:23:13,506 --> 00:23:15,633
Want a drink?

169
00:23:28,313 --> 00:23:29,710
Bird.

170
00:23:30,648 --> 00:23:32,317
Come to Mama.

171
00:23:33,568 --> 00:23:34,965
Lea?

172
00:23:35,195 --> 00:23:37,447
You scared my bird.

173
00:23:41,284 --> 00:23:43,912
Put your pajamas.
Grandma is gonna come.

174
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:52,420
I made posters for the Day of Woody Allen.

175
00:23:52,462 --> 00:23:55,548
- I do not know which to choose.
- Maybe this.

176
00:23:57,926 --> 00:23:59,552
What are those squiggles?

177
00:24:01,012 --> 00:24:03,932
What happened?
Not like most of the apartment?

178
00:24:04,349 --> 00:24:06,726
No, that's fine.

179
00:24:08,728 --> 00:24:10,855
You became obsessed
with this table.

180
00:24:11,439 --> 00:24:14,359
I misplaced my necklace.

181
00:24:14,651 --> 00:24:16,986
Jeanne?
Will you answer me?

182
00:24:18,154 --> 00:24:19,906
I see changes everywhere.

183
00:24:19,948 --> 00:24:22,492
The table and other things.
Everywhere.

184
00:24:22,534 --> 00:24:24,661
Their eyes and faces.
Everything is changing.

185
00:24:24,702 --> 00:24:26,621
Everything?
What do you mean?

186
00:24:26,663 --> 00:24:29,916
I do not know where I am
and most do not recognize this apartment.

187
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:32,585
I recognize some things,
furniture...

188
00:24:34,295 --> 00:24:36,422
But we are not ourselves.

189
00:24:36,714 --> 00:24:39,551
And the pictures and videos...

190
00:24:41,886 --> 00:24:45,265
...do not recognize anyone.
Not us.

191
00:24:45,306 --> 00:24:47,016
It is a different family.

192
00:24:48,309 --> 00:24:52,522
Outside things are normal,
but here...

193
00:25:05,994 --> 00:25:07,370
Are you serious?

194
00:25:19,132 --> 00:25:21,634
Do not recognize anyone
is a serious matter.

195
00:25:21,676 --> 00:25:23,678
Maybe something with your head.

196
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:26,389
Maybe a brain injury
or a tumor. I do not know.

197
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,996
A tumor?

198
00:25:29,392 --> 00:25:31,519
Stop saying those things.

199
00:25:32,645 --> 00:25:34,272
I recognize you.

200
00:25:34,606 --> 00:25:36,482
You said no.

201
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:41,779
I recognize many things.
This is not a tumor.

202
00:25:52,248 --> 00:25:54,292
Maybe it's his eyes.

203
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:57,378
Go to the hospital.
See a doctor.

204
00:25:58,713 --> 00:26:00,840
I'm afraid.

205
00:26:02,175 --> 00:26:05,720
Maybe it's nothing serious
it has to be examined.

206
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,681
It's okay.

207
00:26:16,147 --> 00:26:19,651
Tonight we will relax.
Let's not talk of literature.

208
00:26:19,692 --> 00:26:21,528
- OK?
- No, no.

209
00:26:25,865 --> 00:26:28,243
<i>- Good night.
- Good night, Teo. </ I></i>

210
00:26:28,451 --> 00:26:30,245
<i>- How are you?
- Okay. </ I></i>

211
00:26:30,391 --> 00:26:31,746
<i>Children already dined. </ i></i>

212
00:26:31,788 --> 00:26:33,998
<i>- Jeanne is in our room.
- I know the way. </ I></i>

213
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,500
<i>like a drink? </ i></i>

214
00:26:35,542 --> 00:26:37,627
Why do not you call?

215
00:26:38,837 --> 00:26:40,338
Not have time.

216
00:26:41,297 --> 00:26:44,217
But stop, I get stressed
for you to worry.

217
00:26:47,428 --> 00:26:48,826
Thank you.

218
00:26:49,681 --> 00:26:51,099
No.

219
00:26:53,476 --> 00:26:56,938
I will not insist further.
I do not understand but okay.

220
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,481
A pity.

221
00:26:58,648 --> 00:27:01,401
There is food in the refrigerator,
and thanks for the shawl.

222
00:27:10,451 --> 00:27:13,413
It is the story of a woman
witnessing a crime.

223
00:27:13,454 --> 00:27:15,623
She hears a gun firing.

224
00:27:15,665 --> 00:27:20,378
Everyone around you try
help her cope with the shock.

225
00:27:20,962 --> 00:27:23,423
And very quickly, she is deaf.

226
00:27:23,464 --> 00:27:25,091
<i>I've heard enough. </ i></i>

227
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:28,094
<i>is not what it is. </ i></i>

228
00:27:28,303 --> 00:27:31,389
According to her,
is related to the firing of the gun.

229
00:27:31,431 --> 00:27:36,269
But her husband, who was with her,
not remember anything.

230
00:27:36,311 --> 00:27:38,730
As if his memory
had been cleaned.

231
00:27:38,771 --> 00:27:43,234
She begins to suspect her husband's
and the people around you.

232
00:27:43,276 --> 00:27:46,029
Why are behaving
in a strange way.

233
00:27:49,407 --> 00:27:51,993
She oversees the.

234
00:27:52,994 --> 00:27:56,122
We fear that she may be dead.

235
00:27:56,748 --> 00:28:00,084
It is when we understand
she died at the beginning.

236
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:03,463
- It seems very interesting.
- This is a complete nonsense.

237
00:28:03,671 --> 00:28:06,591
Forgot Italian
he learned in school?

238
00:28:06,592 --> 00:28:08,677
I remember perfectly.

239
00:28:08,885 --> 00:28:10,303
Okay.

240
00:28:10,304 --> 00:28:12,911
Are you satisfied or talk some more.

241
00:28:13,348 --> 00:28:16,142
Anyway, it is not
the film is.

242
00:28:16,226 --> 00:28:17,644
<i>Here. </ i></i>

243
00:28:22,315 --> 00:28:25,318
<i>is the story of a woman
he sees an accident... </ i></i>

244
00:28:49,968 --> 00:28:51,928
It's a little tricky.

245
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,721
<i>We will see you
and judge ourselves. </ i></i>

246
00:31:01,474 --> 00:31:03,184
What are you doing, Jeanne?

247
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,669
Nothing.

248
00:31:08,731 --> 00:31:10,358
I do not know.

249
00:31:15,238 --> 00:31:17,240
Why are you crying?

250
00:31:17,657 --> 00:31:19,096
What?

251
00:31:20,118 --> 00:31:21,557
I'm not crying.

252
00:31:28,751 --> 00:31:30,190
I do not understand.

253
00:31:31,045 --> 00:31:32,797
I'm not sad.

254
00:31:33,506 --> 00:31:35,466
Not even noticed.

255
00:31:37,302 --> 00:31:39,679
You are hiding something, Jeanne?

256
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:47,228
In the book and the problem of the eyes,
you seem absent.

257
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,230
You do not pay attention.

258
00:31:50,648 --> 00:31:52,650
Even the children have noticed.

259
00:31:56,112 --> 00:31:57,614
They said that?

260
00:32:11,211 --> 00:32:13,713
It is because of the book
or is it something else?

261
00:32:13,755 --> 00:32:15,423
I want to know.

262
00:32:19,344 --> 00:32:20,762
I do not know.

263
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,057
I do not know...

264
00:32:27,644 --> 00:32:29,938
I do not know
I do not understand...

265
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:34,567
I'll try to be more attentive.

266
00:32:36,069 --> 00:32:40,573
Come. Are 3 in the morning. I work.

267
00:33:18,403 --> 00:33:19,904
- Are you crazy?
- Sorry.

268
00:33:19,946 --> 00:33:22,949
- Be careful.
- Yes, sorry.

269
00:33:59,277 --> 00:34:01,529
Unable...

270
00:34:42,487 --> 00:34:46,115
Unable...

271
00:34:48,868 --> 00:34:52,330
<i>...service is out. </ i></i>

272
00:34:55,917 --> 00:34:58,711
- Here.
- Thank you.

273
00:35:03,049 --> 00:35:06,386
<i>never bother about the number itself
so it's normal to forget it. </ i></i>

274
00:35:10,932 --> 00:35:13,017
You okay?
What happened?

275
00:35:13,893 --> 00:35:15,520
<i>She is shaken. </ i></i>

276
00:35:15,895 --> 00:35:18,565
I had a lapse of memory
but now everything is fine.

277
00:35:19,691 --> 00:35:22,443
Come on, children are alone.

278
00:35:23,194 --> 00:35:24,863
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

279
00:35:24,904 --> 00:35:27,782
- What are you doing?
- The same every day.

280
00:35:27,949 --> 00:35:30,118
It will become a vegetarian?

281
00:35:47,802 --> 00:35:49,241
Hurry.

282
00:35:58,146 --> 00:35:59,689
Between.

283
00:36:01,357 --> 00:36:03,193
Jeremie?
Lea?

284
00:36:05,361 --> 00:36:06,863
Children?

285
00:36:07,177 --> 00:36:08,990
<i>We are in the room. </ i></i>

286
00:36:10,116 --> 00:36:12,911
<i>Jeremie?
What are you doing? </ I></i>

287
00:36:29,302 --> 00:36:31,012
<i>Mom. </ i></i>

288
00:36:40,355 --> 00:36:42,899
I'm hot.
I'm going to change.

289
00:36:46,361 --> 00:36:48,279
I'll put the cartoon.

290
00:38:46,856 --> 00:38:48,233
Jeanne?

291
00:38:55,281 --> 00:38:56,658
What?

292
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,639
What?

293
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,037
See?

294
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:03,164
Yes, you are very red.

295
00:39:04,582 --> 00:39:05,959
That's it?

296
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,962
What do you mean?

297
00:39:12,298 --> 00:39:13,758
I do not understand.

298
00:39:18,346 --> 00:39:21,349
What were you doing?
What is wrong?

299
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:24,644
- Sit down.
- I feel hot.

300
00:39:30,024 --> 00:39:33,069
- What the doctor say?
- Nothing.

301
00:39:33,653 --> 00:39:35,405
Well, something.

302
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:40,785
Cranial pressure rose.
Can be the cause.

303
00:39:41,494 --> 00:39:46,207
- Why? What else could it be?
- Nothing. I do not know.

304
00:39:48,001 --> 00:39:50,378
- He gave some treatment?
- Yes

305
00:39:51,379 --> 00:39:53,464
There seems to be sure.

306
00:39:53,631 --> 00:39:55,216
Let's call him.

307
00:39:55,258 --> 00:39:57,677
- I want to know.
- Not now, please.

308
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:59,304
Tomorrow, OK?

309
00:40:10,565 --> 00:40:12,400
- Still feeling hot?
- Yes

310
00:40:15,445 --> 00:40:18,448
- Just how hot?
- Stop, is with cold hands.

311
00:40:18,489 --> 00:40:22,118
- Do not feel so hot.
- Stop it.

312
00:40:29,834 --> 00:40:32,670
Let's go out for a few days
after the day of Woody Allen.

313
00:40:33,213 --> 00:40:34,672
Going to do well.

314
00:40:34,714 --> 00:40:37,425
We can go to the Hotel Borgne.
You like it.

315
00:40:37,467 --> 00:40:39,385
- Borgne?
- Yes

316
00:40:40,136 --> 00:40:42,055
I've never been there.

317
00:40:42,722 --> 00:40:46,017
- You're wrong, not me.
- Stop.

318
00:40:46,059 --> 00:40:49,145
I saw you sing. I was
firefighter club karaoke.

319
00:40:49,187 --> 00:40:51,814
It will not convince me
it was not you.

320
00:40:52,774 --> 00:40:55,777
Were you there?
How do you know?

321
00:40:56,236 --> 00:40:58,655
I mean, you remember that?

322
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:11,918
I miss you, Teo.

323
00:41:13,545 --> 00:41:15,505
I miss you.

324
00:41:17,882 --> 00:41:19,926
I'm not doing it on purpose.

325
00:41:21,427 --> 00:41:23,471
Things will improve.

326
00:41:58,006 --> 00:41:59,591
Relax.

327
00:42:02,927 --> 00:42:04,554
Relax.

328
00:43:13,373 --> 00:43:14,812
Teo?

329
00:43:15,333 --> 00:43:16,709
Teo?

330
00:43:17,752 --> 00:43:20,380
No.

331
00:43:21,589 --> 00:43:24,467
Let me go, motherfucker!
Let go!

332
00:43:35,895 --> 00:43:37,355
Sorry.

333
00:43:39,148 --> 00:43:40,942
No, that was good.

334
00:43:42,986 --> 00:43:45,989
This guy and that,
"Let me go, bitch!"

335
00:43:47,949 --> 00:43:49,450
I loved it.

336
00:43:51,411 --> 00:43:55,206
I had the courage to ask you
call me a piece of shit.

337
00:43:55,248 --> 00:43:56,624
That would have been better.

338
00:44:16,102 --> 00:44:18,605
Daddy, the movie ended.

339
00:44:19,105 --> 00:44:20,857
Mommy will give you a bath.

340
00:44:21,399 --> 00:44:23,735
I take a walk.
I need air.

341
00:44:30,241 --> 00:44:33,328
No...

342
00:44:35,246 --> 00:44:37,957
I need psychiatric help.

343
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:43,630
<i>Jeanne did not say
has always been fragile. </ i></i>

344
00:44:44,297 --> 00:44:46,883
<i>Nor said
who suffered a serious accident. </ i></i>

345
00:44:47,342 --> 00:44:48,968
What caused amnesia.

346
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:51,262
I do not know what all this means.

347
00:44:52,764 --> 00:44:55,308
<i>Can you tell me something more
about these changes? </ i></i>

348
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:56,935
<i>What changed? </ i></i>

349
00:44:59,812 --> 00:45:03,483
Everything.
The colors of things.

350
00:45:03,775 --> 00:45:05,193
Others.

351
00:45:06,069 --> 00:45:07,508
I.

352
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:10,823
And how do you see?

353
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:12,992
I...

354
00:45:14,994 --> 00:45:19,123
I always had brown hair
and blue eyes, green.

355
00:45:22,043 --> 00:45:24,671
How do you see your husband?

356
00:45:26,965 --> 00:45:29,175
Well

357
00:45:30,593 --> 00:45:32,303
It is not pretty.

358
00:45:33,054 --> 00:45:35,807
Well, it's a little prettier.

359
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:41,145
I see a man with
light brown hair, short,

360
00:45:41,646 --> 00:45:45,859
blue eyes and a small
scar on his forehead.

361
00:45:46,192 --> 00:45:49,863
Broad shoulders and slightly bent.

362
00:45:50,446 --> 00:45:52,782
Tall, with dark complexion.

363
00:45:56,035 --> 00:45:59,038
There is nothing wrong
to see it differently.

364
00:45:59,414 --> 00:46:01,416
No, I see it the same way.

365
00:46:01,457 --> 00:46:06,754
But my husband had brown eyes
and a clear complexion.

366
00:46:06,796 --> 00:46:10,049
Hair too dark, wavy.

367
00:46:10,091 --> 00:46:13,178
He had a round body
a constitution and heavier.

368
00:46:13,219 --> 00:46:15,722
This is the man with whom I lived.

369
00:46:17,265 --> 00:46:19,893
He is not the same man.

370
00:46:20,768 --> 00:46:22,645
Incredible, is not it?

371
00:46:22,687 --> 00:46:26,608
This is difficult for you,
but try to understand without judging.

372
00:46:26,649 --> 00:46:29,027
You can leave us alone?

373
00:46:29,068 --> 00:46:31,446
- Yes
- Thank you.

374
00:46:47,754 --> 00:46:50,673
Yes?
I'm listening.

375
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:54,010
Nothing.
I said everything.

376
00:46:54,052 --> 00:46:56,679
These changes and gestures...

377
00:46:58,306 --> 00:47:03,770
As if the gestures
were made by others.

378
00:47:04,646 --> 00:47:07,732
Strange faces that have stopped coming.

379
00:47:07,774 --> 00:47:10,235
As if they were
keeping a secret.

380
00:47:10,401 --> 00:47:12,403
Moments with no connection to anything.

381
00:47:12,946 --> 00:47:15,573
- Like a dream?
- Nothing like that.

382
00:47:16,491 --> 00:47:19,702
Changes
in your daily life scare you?

383
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:22,080
Not much.

384
00:47:22,163 --> 00:47:24,123
But it all seems staged,

385
00:47:24,124 --> 00:47:27,126
as if I were manipulated
for my husband and children.

386
00:47:29,087 --> 00:47:31,381
You said it also changed.

387
00:47:31,422 --> 00:47:35,009
But since he came here this means
you think you have a problem.

388
00:47:36,302 --> 00:47:38,429
There must be something more.

389
00:47:38,763 --> 00:47:41,307
It's not just me.

390
00:47:42,141 --> 00:47:44,227
Everything is so different.

391
00:47:44,811 --> 00:47:49,691
When you say "different"
I hear "the others are lying. "

392
00:47:50,149 --> 00:47:51,776
Think I'm lying?

393
00:47:52,443 --> 00:47:55,280
- I meant the other.
- What else?

394
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:57,282
It's just a thought.

395
00:47:57,323 --> 00:48:01,703
Do you feel manipulated and believes
that there is a hidden reality.

396
00:48:01,744 --> 00:48:04,372
I do not know...
I'm telling you what I hear.

397
00:48:04,831 --> 00:48:08,293
Often see
what we believe.

398
00:48:08,459 --> 00:48:10,962
As those drawings
to hide a second drawing.

399
00:48:11,004 --> 00:48:14,007
When we see the first,
no longer see the second.

400
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:17,969
I was not drawing.
I made sketches of the apartment to...

401
00:48:18,011 --> 00:48:21,472
I'm not talking about it.
That was a metaphor.

402
00:48:26,311 --> 00:48:27,854
I do not know.

403
00:48:30,773 --> 00:48:35,486
When I think about it...
I do not know...

404
00:48:40,074 --> 00:48:43,995
Someone should monitor it,
but with their consent.

405
00:48:44,037 --> 00:48:48,124
I do not want to impose a treatment
to worsen things.

406
00:48:48,166 --> 00:48:50,043
Since there
no neurological problem.

407
00:48:50,084 --> 00:48:52,587
Monitor the situation
and do not hesitate to return.

408
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:54,923
- Thank you, doctor.
- Thank you.

409
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:59,802
I want to spend a few days
with my mother.

410
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:04,140
Previously, when he felt ill,
you looking for me, not her mother.

411
00:49:04,224 --> 00:49:06,142
Can I get a ride?

412
00:49:25,078 --> 00:49:27,497
Be careful
is driving too fast.

413
00:49:34,257 --> 00:49:38,428
Subtitles
_rMonta_

414
00:49:55,316 --> 00:49:57,944
Please do not use it against me.

415
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:00,989
Will you call me tomorrow?

416
00:50:01,114 --> 00:50:02,490
Yes

417
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:23,699
Mom?

418
00:50:49,078 --> 00:50:50,517
Mom?

419
00:50:56,461 --> 00:50:57,837
Mom?

420
00:51:19,067 --> 00:51:20,422
Mom?

421
00:51:20,443 --> 00:51:21,819
Darling.

422
00:51:24,155 --> 00:51:26,407
Mom...

423
00:51:26,699 --> 00:51:28,785
I feel bad.

424
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:32,372
- I want to go home.
- In 10 minutes.

425
00:51:33,498 --> 00:51:35,542
Why not now?

426
00:51:35,583 --> 00:51:38,545
- How long are you here?
- Listen, not now.

427
00:51:38,962 --> 00:51:42,423
- In 10 minutes?
- Yes, 10 or 15.

428
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:46,719
Go drink something.

429
00:51:47,762 --> 00:51:49,764
- 300.
- The bet is 300.

430
00:51:50,682 --> 00:51:52,767
- Increase to 600.
- Pay.

431
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:55,478
- The bet is 600.
- Yes

432
00:52:00,024 --> 00:52:01,380
Madame?

433
00:52:01,693 --> 00:52:04,612
- You need something?
- No, thanks.

434
00:52:11,327 --> 00:52:13,788
- Ace
- 1000.

435
00:52:17,292 --> 00:52:18,710
Madame, it's your turn.

436
00:52:35,643 --> 00:52:37,562
Madame wins.

437
00:54:02,647 --> 00:54:05,900
Madame, the use of mirrors
is prohibited.

438
00:54:15,827 --> 00:54:17,704
- Sir, it's your turn.
- 1000.

439
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:07,274
Lord, it's your turn.

440
00:55:18,494 --> 00:55:19,891
Mom?

441
00:55:19,933 --> 00:55:23,520
- Any problem?
- It's okay.

442
00:55:27,273 --> 00:55:29,192
- I'm going.
- 5 minutes.

443
00:55:29,234 --> 00:55:32,529
Hold on.
Go get my things.

444
00:55:32,695 --> 00:55:34,822
Wait for me, I'm going.

445
00:55:39,494 --> 00:55:41,037
Sorry.

446
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:17,407
Too small for you.

447
00:56:22,954 --> 00:56:25,623
I can not breathe.

448
00:56:42,015 --> 00:56:44,309
Still working
the novel?

449
00:56:52,317 --> 00:56:54,194
He spoke with Robert again?

450
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:58,427
Jeanne?

451
00:57:00,825 --> 00:57:02,535
You okay?

452
00:57:03,411 --> 00:57:05,205
Yes

453
00:57:07,498 --> 00:57:10,460
No answer.
And the romance?

454
00:57:10,502 --> 00:57:13,129
Crap!
Stop asking about the novel!

455
00:57:13,171 --> 00:57:15,590
- Just keeps asking about it.
- So why come?

456
00:57:15,632 --> 00:57:18,468
Why did you come if you do not want to talk?

457
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:21,346
He would not talk to me
for weeks and months.

458
00:57:21,387 --> 00:57:24,057
Who am I to you?
Make dinner yourself.

459
00:57:24,182 --> 00:57:27,352
I'm not avoiding you.
I'm tired of these questions.

460
00:57:27,393 --> 00:57:30,939
Robert gave me and started reading.
Should I return it?

461
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:32,336
How could you?

462
00:57:34,234 --> 00:57:35,610
Here.

463
00:57:36,194 --> 00:57:39,489
What a relief.
I could not finish it.

464
00:57:41,783 --> 00:57:43,409
It's too bad.

465
00:57:43,868 --> 00:57:47,997
It is unreadable.
Descriptions that never end.

466
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:51,584
Thank you for my picture.

467
00:57:54,337 --> 00:57:56,798
I want to stop
write this novel.

468
00:57:57,382 --> 00:58:02,345
Do not relive the past.
It is painful for both of us.

469
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:14,774
Jeanne?

470
00:58:17,944 --> 00:58:19,988
You scare me.
What is wrong?

471
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:21,468
Nothing.

472
00:58:28,246 --> 00:58:30,248
You misunderstood me.

473
00:58:32,959 --> 00:58:35,378
I need to recover my memories.

474
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:38,715
I told him about his childhood
and that is enough.

475
00:58:39,465 --> 00:58:40,904
No.

476
00:58:41,509 --> 00:58:43,595
I'm missing something.

477
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:45,972
Or you're not telling me everything.

478
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:47,974
I?

479
00:58:54,522 --> 00:58:55,878
Honey?

480
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,318
Honey?

481
00:59:05,158 --> 00:59:06,534
Jeanne?

482
00:59:09,287 --> 00:59:10,872
What's going on?

483
00:59:14,542 --> 00:59:16,127
Jeanne?

484
00:59:16,419 --> 00:59:19,422
No...

485
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:28,306
I can not continue like this...

486
00:59:29,265 --> 00:59:30,892
What's going on?

487
00:59:32,018 --> 00:59:35,104
You're pale.
Should I call a doctor?

488
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:47,075
The past is painful.
It is good to remind him.

489
00:59:48,868 --> 00:59:50,828
Why are you doing this?

490
00:59:52,205 --> 00:59:54,582
I think I'm crazy.

491
00:59:54,999 --> 00:59:59,921
Are you nervous because of the novel.
Why not work as a writer?

492
01:00:04,968 --> 01:00:07,220
I do not love my children.

493
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:10,139
I am a bad mother.

494
01:00:10,181 --> 01:00:12,892
Never got used to them.

495
01:00:12,934 --> 01:00:18,356
I make a great effort,
Teo so do not get it.

496
01:00:19,357 --> 01:00:23,570
I feel trapped by it.
I'm afraid.

497
01:00:24,612 --> 01:00:29,117
I'm doing what I can
but it is not good.

498
01:00:29,701 --> 01:00:31,786
I do not know why.

499
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:40,086
I need to rediscover my childhood.

500
01:00:40,128 --> 01:00:43,089
You think not, but you love them.

501
01:00:43,131 --> 01:00:48,094
Ask not so much.
If you do not love them, then pretend.

502
01:00:52,974 --> 01:00:55,268
How you?

503
01:00:56,561 --> 01:01:01,024
I was not bad for you.
You will regret what he said.

504
01:01:03,568 --> 01:01:06,321
I want to go to Sicily.
I want to travel.

505
01:01:06,946 --> 01:01:08,448
I will not let you go
this state.

506
01:01:08,489 --> 01:01:10,283
- Let me go.
- You're all I have.

507
01:01:10,325 --> 01:01:12,076
I can not stand the fact
which is very far.

508
01:01:12,118 --> 01:01:13,953
- You're all I have.
- Stop it!

509
01:01:13,995 --> 01:01:16,289
Stop, I can not stand it.

510
01:01:16,331 --> 01:01:19,042
I'll go and lie down, okay?

511
01:01:59,249 --> 01:02:00,959
LECCE 1979

512
01:02:01,793 --> 01:02:04,003
What are you doing, dear?

513
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:08,487
Who are they?

514
01:02:12,804 --> 01:02:14,180
's Us.

515
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:17,600
This is you.
And this is me.

516
01:02:17,642 --> 01:02:19,269
And who is that?

517
01:02:20,186 --> 01:02:22,522
An Italian friend.
Nobody special.

518
01:02:22,564 --> 01:02:25,024
I do not know why I kept that picture.

519
01:02:25,066 --> 01:02:27,610
Not look this drawer for years.

520
01:02:27,652 --> 01:02:31,030
Look, a theater ticket.

521
01:02:31,114 --> 01:02:32,949
I do not know why...

522
01:02:32,991 --> 01:02:36,786
This woman can not be Italian.
This is impossible.

523
01:02:37,245 --> 01:02:39,205
She was here a while ago.

524
01:02:39,622 --> 01:02:41,416
And it was you.

525
01:02:49,841 --> 01:02:52,093
She is a foreigner.

526
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:55,513
And this is you, my mother.

527
01:02:56,368 --> 01:02:57,807
Really?

528
01:02:57,849 --> 01:03:01,269
What do you mean?
Of course I'm your mother.

529
01:03:01,311 --> 01:03:05,982
But you always had that face.
Until a while ago.

530
01:03:06,024 --> 01:03:08,318
I do not know who you are.

531
01:03:08,359 --> 01:03:11,321
She is my mother.
I do not understand.

532
01:03:19,579 --> 01:03:21,122
Hold on.

533
01:03:36,804 --> 01:03:38,348
You leaving?

534
01:03:39,265 --> 01:03:40,975
Forgive me.

535
01:03:44,437 --> 01:03:48,566
Mom! Open the door,
Stop it, Mom.

536
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:51,110
Madame?

537
01:05:16,613 --> 01:05:18,823
What are you doing
with your hair?

538
01:05:18,865 --> 01:05:21,242
- Come, let's go home.
- I can not.

539
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:24,037
- I brought my stuff?
- I brought.

540
01:05:29,334 --> 01:05:32,003
His mother is concerned
and looked for you everywhere.

541
01:05:32,045 --> 01:05:35,006
- I left it with the neighbors.
- It is not my mother.

542
01:05:35,048 --> 01:05:38,843
- Jeanne, this is absurd.
- Yeah?

543
01:05:39,511 --> 01:05:40,929
Look.

544
01:05:42,472 --> 01:05:43,869
Great.

545
01:05:44,015 --> 01:05:46,518
His mother, you and a blonde.

546
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:47,936
What is the problem?

547
01:05:49,938 --> 01:05:51,314
I'm going.

548
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:53,650
Jeanne, listen.

549
01:05:55,610 --> 01:05:58,988
Jeanne, you are making things worse.

550
01:05:59,489 --> 01:06:02,867
Go to the hospital
and you will calm down.

551
01:06:03,785 --> 01:06:06,037
Let's go home
and spend a few days in bed.

552
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:08,081
At least the children
will see you.

553
01:06:09,082 --> 01:06:11,084
Look what they did to you.

554
01:06:11,835 --> 01:06:13,253
Look.

555
01:06:15,255 --> 01:06:17,799
Stop!
Do not blackmail.

556
01:06:17,841 --> 01:06:20,009
- I do not see it.
- What blackmail?

557
01:06:20,051 --> 01:06:22,637
Are your children
and need you.

558
01:06:24,722 --> 01:06:28,518
I do not recognize
my face at all, Teo.

559
01:06:31,187 --> 01:06:35,358
Let me go for a few days.
Trust me.

560
01:06:40,864 --> 01:06:42,824
You do not love me anymore?

561
01:06:43,783 --> 01:06:45,201
I do not know.

562
01:10:29,008 --> 01:10:30,385
Mom?

563
01:10:30,426 --> 01:10:32,303
Sit at the table.

564
01:10:49,946 --> 01:10:51,739
<i>You okay?
Are you sure? </ I></i>

565
01:10:52,282 --> 01:10:53,741
A little tired.

566
01:11:16,973 --> 01:11:18,725
Can we talk?

567
01:11:18,808 --> 01:11:21,978
- But I do not understand. I'll get...
- Wait.

568
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:25,190
I came because of this photo.
And for you.

569
01:11:25,690 --> 01:11:27,442
Recognize?

570
01:11:32,447 --> 01:11:34,908
No, do not recognize this picture.

571
01:11:35,825 --> 01:11:37,410
What do you drink?

572
01:11:42,582 --> 01:11:43,958
Coffee.

573
01:11:44,334 --> 01:11:46,002
And a cream amaretto.

574
01:11:48,421 --> 01:11:50,173
My name is Jeanne.
And yours?

575
01:11:54,928 --> 01:11:57,347
I will make the cream, I hope you enjoy.

576
01:11:58,765 --> 01:12:00,225
I came to France to see her.

577
01:12:00,433 --> 01:12:02,101
Let me go.
I'm working.

578
01:12:03,061 --> 01:12:04,479
You are bothering me.

579
01:12:04,854 --> 01:12:06,272
Eat and go!

580
01:12:06,481 --> 01:12:07,857
Why was upset about it?

581
01:12:14,093 --> 01:12:15,469
<i>What happened? </ i></i>

582
01:12:15,573 --> 01:12:17,825
Nothing.
I do not feel well.

583
01:12:18,034 --> 01:12:19,410
Who is that?

584
01:12:19,494 --> 01:12:21,746
Nobody. A French.
I'm going home.

585
01:12:37,011 --> 01:12:38,388
Hi

586
01:12:42,016 --> 01:12:43,434
We know?

587
01:12:45,645 --> 01:12:47,355
I do not know. What do you think?

588
01:12:48,398 --> 01:12:50,233
No, not really.

589
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:58,345
Are you all right, miss?
Eat something, you're pale.

590
01:13:34,319 --> 01:13:35,737
Is everything okay?

591
01:13:36,029 --> 01:13:37,405
Okay.

592
01:13:38,072 --> 01:13:39,699
Sorry, I'm back
to the hotel.

593
01:13:41,409 --> 01:13:42,806
Okay.

594
01:14:20,365 --> 01:14:22,534
The girl in the picture, who is?

595
01:14:22,742 --> 01:14:24,160
What picture?

596
01:15:41,779 --> 01:15:44,199
Come.

597
01:15:44,490 --> 01:15:45,867
Calm down, lady.

598
01:15:50,538 --> 01:15:52,332
Come, Teo, between.

599
01:15:54,209 --> 01:15:57,212
I do not speak French.
My name is Gianni.

600
01:15:57,462 --> 01:15:58,859
I work in coffee.

601
01:16:01,716 --> 01:16:03,072
Sure.

602
01:16:04,177 --> 01:16:07,805
I have nothing here
but I can ask anything you want.

603
01:16:10,975 --> 01:16:12,477
I will not take, thank you.

604
01:16:13,353 --> 01:16:14,792
I just wanted...

605
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:20,109
I was worried.
You looked completely lost.

606
01:16:22,737 --> 01:16:24,239
This hotel is beautiful.

607
01:16:27,408 --> 01:16:29,035
You are here as a tourist?

608
01:16:30,537 --> 01:16:32,121
You are here as a tourist?

609
01:16:34,499 --> 01:16:35,959
- Gianni, right?
- Yes

610
01:16:40,588 --> 01:16:43,675
- The lady in the coffee sent you?
- My mother? No.

611
01:16:44,092 --> 01:16:46,094
Why do you follow me?

612
01:16:46,302 --> 01:16:47,741
I do not know.

613
01:16:48,763 --> 01:16:50,431
I really do not know.

614
01:16:51,516 --> 01:16:53,601
Sorry,
you should think...

615
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:58,189
I do not know what to follow.

616
01:17:06,322 --> 01:17:09,284
Finally, I
the feeling that you, Teo.

617
01:17:09,951 --> 01:17:11,369
Are you?

618
01:17:11,828 --> 01:17:13,830
Not what you think.

619
01:17:14,038 --> 01:17:15,394
Not what you think.

620
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,417
Swear.

621
01:17:19,919 --> 01:17:21,337
So what?

622
01:17:26,467 --> 01:17:27,906
What is it?

623
01:17:38,771 --> 01:17:40,127
Hold on.

624
01:17:40,315 --> 01:17:41,712
Hold on.

625
01:18:24,150 --> 01:18:26,569
Hold on.
Calmly.

626
01:18:27,779 --> 01:18:30,323
- Calmly.
- I want you.

627
01:19:09,863 --> 01:19:12,240
- What is it?
- Nothing. I do not know...

628
01:19:12,866 --> 01:19:14,576
Your touch is weird.

629
01:19:24,586 --> 01:19:25,962
Stop.

630
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,590
Stop!

631
01:19:29,799 --> 01:19:32,051
You're weird.
Do not recognize.

632
01:19:43,938 --> 01:19:45,336
Impossible.

633
01:19:46,399 --> 01:19:49,360
I recognize your face
but do not recognize you.

634
01:19:49,569 --> 01:19:51,487
Who are you?
You are not Teo.

635
01:19:53,031 --> 01:19:55,700
- Who are you?
- What are you talking about?

636
01:19:57,452 --> 01:19:58,849
Who is Teo?

637
01:20:00,246 --> 01:20:01,623
'm Gianni.

638
01:20:01,998 --> 01:20:03,374
Who is Teo?

639
01:20:05,168 --> 01:20:07,003
Not come to this.

640
01:20:11,341 --> 01:20:12,759
I'm going.

641
01:20:13,593 --> 01:20:15,637
- Do not leave me!
- I am leaving!

642
01:20:16,137 --> 01:20:17,805
We were both wrong.

643
01:20:18,014 --> 01:20:20,099
Do not go!
Hold on!

644
01:20:25,063 --> 01:20:27,774
Gianni, wait!
Do not go.

645
01:20:27,982 --> 01:20:29,776
I'm not here by accident.

646
01:20:29,984 --> 01:20:31,945
I'm looking for this woman.
I know her.

647
01:20:36,407 --> 01:20:38,368
Often we are faced with tourists.

648
01:20:39,369 --> 01:20:40,828
My mother was young at that time.

649
01:20:41,037 --> 01:20:43,248
That does not mean we met.

650
01:20:43,456 --> 01:20:44,999
Why she went home?

651
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:47,961
Because he felt bad.
It happens.

652
01:20:48,294 --> 01:20:49,712
His mother...

653
01:20:50,547 --> 01:20:53,258
I grew up with it.
For me she is my mother.

654
01:20:53,466 --> 01:20:54,884
What are you saying?

655
01:20:56,052 --> 01:20:57,887
Need to understand that.

656
01:20:59,013 --> 01:21:00,431
Help me.

657
01:21:05,603 --> 01:21:07,021
Come.

658
01:21:11,442 --> 01:21:12,798
Sit.

659
01:21:22,161 --> 01:21:24,247
Do you know anyone here?

660
01:21:26,332 --> 01:21:30,378
Call your husband, your parents.
Can I call someone to pick her up.

661
01:21:34,465 --> 01:21:37,677
I need to talk to his mother.
It is important to me.

662
01:21:38,761 --> 01:21:41,472
My mother did not know you,
like me.

663
01:21:42,223 --> 01:21:44,642
His family should take care of you.

664
01:21:46,186 --> 01:21:48,855
- There is something...
- Do not insist!

665
01:21:49,647 --> 01:21:51,045
You are wrong.

666
01:21:53,401 --> 01:21:54,757
Go home.

667
01:21:55,361 --> 01:21:57,113
Believe me. Enough.

668
01:21:59,490 --> 01:22:01,055
Why to me...

669
01:22:05,830 --> 01:22:08,208
You remind me of someone I knew.

670
01:22:08,416 --> 01:22:10,793
- Who?
- No matter, she's dead.

671
01:22:11,002 --> 01:22:14,339
It can be you.
Leave me alone.

672
01:22:15,131 --> 01:22:16,549
Go back to the hotel.

673
01:26:09,908 --> 01:26:11,910
<i>Fabrizio, happy birthday! </ i></i>

674
01:26:12,118 --> 01:26:15,038
<i>How old are you?
You do not have 30 yet, right? </ I></i>

675
01:30:29,876 --> 01:30:31,586
What did she do to you?

676
01:30:32,212 --> 01:30:33,567
It is impossible.

677
01:30:36,591 --> 01:30:38,468
You do not have another 5 years.
Forget it.

678
01:30:38,510 --> 01:30:40,678
So why is
behaving like that?

679
01:30:40,887 --> 01:30:42,805
Why Dad is so aggressive?

680
01:30:43,014 --> 01:30:47,143
Enough! Come on down. Promise
we talk about that later.

681
01:30:47,769 --> 01:30:49,312
Calm down.

682
01:30:49,521 --> 01:30:51,523
No. I'm going to the hotel.

683
01:30:51,731 --> 01:30:53,149
What do you mean?

684
01:30:53,358 --> 01:30:57,487
Do not tell me it is.
Do not tell me is my sister.

685
01:30:57,695 --> 01:31:01,574
Please Gianni.
Rosa Maria is dead. Forget it.

686
01:31:02,075 --> 01:31:03,472
You'll spoil the party.

687
01:31:03,576 --> 01:31:05,537
I do not care!
I'm going to see it.

688
01:31:07,184 --> 01:31:10,458
- Gianni!
- No, let me go.

689
01:33:46,030 --> 01:33:48,366
I do not know where it came from this face.

690
01:33:49,868 --> 01:33:51,703
I do not know who I am.

691
01:33:56,457 --> 01:33:58,793
You become a very beautiful woman.

692
01:34:02,255 --> 01:34:04,716
You looks a lot like his father.

693
01:34:05,508 --> 01:34:07,385
I recognized immediately.

694
01:34:09,929 --> 01:34:11,681
I had no choice.

695
01:34:12,515 --> 01:34:14,601
So much time has passed.

696
01:34:16,644 --> 01:34:20,148
I called his mother, Nadia, in Paris.

697
01:34:20,481 --> 01:34:21,858
She'll come pick you up.

698
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:23,255
My mother?

699
01:34:25,445 --> 01:34:27,572
I can not help you, Rosa Maria.

700
01:34:29,699 --> 01:34:31,075
Go.

701
01:34:31,701 --> 01:34:33,494
Go and never come back.

702
01:34:33,870 --> 01:34:36,206
I cried for a long time.

703
01:34:36,706 --> 01:34:38,103
But he did not.

704
01:34:38,917 --> 01:34:40,314
Do you understand?

705
01:34:42,629 --> 01:34:44,047
You're not his daughter.

706
01:34:44,964 --> 01:34:46,633
He never loved you.

707
01:34:49,969 --> 01:34:51,867
What could I have done
by his brother Gianni?

708
01:34:51,868 --> 01:34:54,078
Gianni, my brother?

709
01:34:55,496 --> 01:34:56,893
Let me.

710
01:34:56,976 --> 01:34:58,937
I feel bad.
I'm afraid.

711
01:35:07,946 --> 01:35:10,490
- Rosa Maria, wait.
- Let me go.

712
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:14,410
What you told her.

713
01:35:17,539 --> 01:35:18,936
Let me!

714
01:36:22,979 --> 01:36:24,355
Care!

715
01:38:21,014 --> 01:38:24,058
No one forced you
to take the place of Jeanne.

716
01:38:24,601 --> 01:38:27,312
You wanted to be called Jeanne
like her.

717
01:38:27,478 --> 01:38:30,106
I have no power
to change things.

718
01:38:34,861 --> 01:38:37,614
After the accident
you did not recognize his parents.

719
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:41,159
Do not remember anything.

720
01:38:41,659 --> 01:38:43,620
You clung to me.

721
01:38:44,412 --> 01:38:46,623
And really became my daughter.

722
01:38:46,748 --> 01:38:49,501
What difference does it make if your name
the Jeanne Rosa or Maria?

723
01:38:49,542 --> 01:38:50,960
And my family?

724
01:39:05,391 --> 01:39:06,809
Go away.

725
01:39:12,941 --> 01:39:14,984
You'll be okay?

726
01:39:21,991 --> 01:39:24,619
Come see us at breakfast.

727
01:42:19,127 --> 01:42:20,587
Mom!

728
01:42:30,513 --> 01:42:32,390
Not happy
see me again?

729
01:42:32,515 --> 01:42:34,475
I prepared a feast for you.

730
01:42:34,517 --> 01:42:36,415
Fortunately his mother kept me informed.

731
01:42:36,457 --> 01:42:37,896
What did she say?

732
01:42:37,937 --> 01:42:41,274
Nothing special.
You made a mistake.

733
01:42:41,733 --> 01:42:44,110
- What are you feeling better.
- That's true.

734
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:46,613
I rested and did me good.

735
01:42:46,654 --> 01:42:49,199
Let's go to your room?
I present to you.

736
01:43:10,386 --> 01:43:16,017
- What are you looking at, Mom?
- Nothing. Let's go to the room.
