00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,700
I've only ever met one man i wouldn't want to fight

2
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,400
when i met him he was already the best cut man in the business

3
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:00,400
started training and managing in the 60's, never lost his gift.

4
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,800
I need to look at him.

5
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,900
He's fine, he's fine.

6
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,900
Even if you dont stop this bleeding
I give you one more round.

7
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,800
Seconds up, lets go.

8
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,400
Wwhat do we do? tell me what to do.

9
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,400
Let him hit you.

10
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:25,600
Sometimes there's just nothing you can do

11
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,600
cuts too high, too close to the bone, 

12
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,400
maybe you got a severed vein, 

13
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,400
or you just cant get the cuagulant deep enough.

14
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,700
The're all kinds of combinations 
you come up against down in the different layers of meat

15
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,700
and frankie knew how to work every one.

16
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,500
People love violence, 

17
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,400
they'll slow down at a car wreck 
to check for bodies, 

18
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,900
same people claim to love boxing, 

19
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,900
they got no idea what it is.

20
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,200
Boxing is about respect, 

21
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,300
getting it for yourself, 

22
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:36,300
and taking it away from the other guy.

23
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,100
I'll warm up the car.

24
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,100
Mr dunn?

25
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,900
I owe you money?

26
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,200
No sir.

27
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,000
I know your momma?

28
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,100
Dont really know sir.

29
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,400
What is it you want?

30
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,500
I was on the inner card, 
i won my fight too, maggie fitzgerald.

31
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,400
Well maggie fitzgerald, what's up?

32
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,000
Did you happen to see it?

33
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Nope.

34
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I did pretty good, 
thought you might be interested in training me.

35
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,500
I dont train girls.

36
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,100
Maybe you should, people seen me fight say 
i'm pretty tough.

37
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:15,100
Girlie, tough aint enough.

38
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,600
It's a mistake.

39
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,900
Car should be able to back up frankie.

40
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,500
Just push will you?

41
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,100
What did HOgan want?

42
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,200
Offered us a title shot.

43
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,500
Bout time.

44
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,500
I turned him down flat, 2 or 3 more fights 
and you'll be ready.

45
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,900
Been 2, 3 more fights 
for a long time now frankie.

46
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,000
Look Willie, you've one shot at the title, 

47
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,200
you lose, it may not come around again

48
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,300
2 or 3 more fights and you'll be ready.

49
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,000
If you say frankie.

50
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,200
Frankie liked to say that boxing was an unnatural act, 

51
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:19,000
that everything in boxing is backwards.

52
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Sometimes best way to deliver punches is step back.

53
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Well dO your best lord, 
protect katie... Annie too, 

54
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,900
other than that, you know what i want,

55
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,800
there's no use repeating myself.

56
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,800
But step back too far, you aint fighting at home.

57
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,300
Father that was a great sermon.Every week.

58
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,600
What's confusing you this week?

59
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,700
Oh same ol one god tree god thing.

60
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,700
Frankie, most people figure out 
by kindergarden it's about faith.

61
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:27,700
Is it sorta like snap, crackle 
and pop all rolled up in one big box?

62
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,400
Your standing outside my church comparing god to rice crispies?

63
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,300
The only reason you can romance at me 
is to wind me up, 

64
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,800
it's not gonna happen this morning.

65
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,000
Well i'm confused.

66
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,700
No you aren't .

67
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,300
Yes I am.

68
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,800
Then here's your answer, 
there's one god,

69
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,600
anything else cause i'm busy?

70
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,000
What about the Holy ghost?

71
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,500
He's an expression of god's love.

72
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,500
and Jesus?

73
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,200
Son of god, dont play stupid.

74
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,600
But who is he then, 
does that make him demi god?

75
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,600
There are no demigods you fucking pagan.

76
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,800
Did you write your daughter?

77
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,700
Absolutely.

78
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,500
Now your lying to a priest.

79
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,500
You know what, take a day off, 
dont come to mass tomorrow.

80
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,200
Some People say the most important thing 
a fighter can have is heart.

81
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,500
Frankie would say, 

82
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,500
show me a fighter who's nothing but heart, 
and i'll show you a man waiting for a beating.

83
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:43,200
Think i've only ever met one fighter who's all heart.

84
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,300
My name is Dangerous Dillard fighting flipo bam bam 

85
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:51,300
... out of Broward county Texas.

86
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,400
Dangerous showed up a couple years back, 

87
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:00,400
it comes to everything to LA with errilville,... new boyfriend, 

88
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,600
apparently errilville got lost, 
and ended up back in Texas.  

89
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Danger looked for him, 
bout a week before he introduced himself.

90
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Hey, you know, I gots nothing against niggers.

91
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,800
Well that's nice to hear.

92
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,800
Yeah, yeah lots of people where i comes from does, 

93
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,800
but My momma taught me not to cause hurt to no man, 
niggers or not.

94
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,500
You got a nice momma, anything there is i can do for ya? 

95
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,600
Just one of those questions you ask. 
But danger wanted to give it his best answer.

96
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,600
Well sir i'd likes to become the welter weight champion of the world,

99
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,600
Yo flip shut up man, you aint even ranked.  

100
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,900
You gotta have at least one fight to be ranked.

101
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,900
Hey i'll fight any man any time.

102
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:07,300

103
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:12,300

104
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,900
Danger, your going back to training.

110
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,800
Give his momma back her tights.

111
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,800
Sherrile , had a left hook that would move a tank 

112
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,900
but he had a heart the size of a split pea.  

113
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:43,200
Frankie....pit from bobby malone 17yrs ago.  

114
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,000
Bobby wanted to move to florida and frankie 
wanted some security.  

115
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,800
Bobby died while he was packing.  

116
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,900
Frankie found out.  

117
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,500
Most gyms lose money.

118
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,400
Thought i told you i didn't want danger 
working out here anymore.

119
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,600
OH he aint hurting nothing frankie.

120
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,600
But he's hurting me, making my heart watching him punch the air 
like it's gonna punch back.

121
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,900
How many times do i got to tell you that bleach is bleach.  

122
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,900
Why can't you just buy the cheap stuff, 
you always have to buy the expensive stuff.

123
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,300
It smells better frankie.

124
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:20,300
Bleach smells like bleach.

125
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,200
Hey scruff...

126
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,200
Heya mr buda..

127
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:48,400
Big willie,   

128
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,900
Nice fight.

129
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,600
Thanks man.

130
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Wanna talk?  

131
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:07,400
(studying language outloud)

132
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,900
what the hell kind of language is that?

133
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,700
What do you want?

134
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:17,700
I just thought you might like to know you got a fighter out 
there not talking to another manager.

135
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,600
Not talking to another manager?

136
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,600
And not just any manager, Mickie Mac

137
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:32,200
You came in here to tell me that 
Big willie is not talking to Mickie Mac?

138
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,900
Not a word, neither one of them.

139
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,500
I'm trying to read here.

140
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,300
If you think that is more important.

141
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,600
Who's your new girl?

142
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,600
What?  

143
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,800
Jesus Christ.

144
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,800
She keeps hitting it like that 
she gonna break her wrists.

145
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,600
Your wasting your time, I told you I dont train girls.

146
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,800
Thought you might change your mind.

147
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,200
There's dozen of trainers who train girls, 
you wont have any trouble finding one.

148
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,100
Won't hardly need a dozen boss, you'll do fine.

149
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,600
Dont' call me boss now, i'm not your boss, 
and dont you be calling me that.  

150
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,100
Willie you ready to work?

151
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,700
Anytime.

152
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,400
If i stop calling you boss will you train me?

153
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,300
No.

154
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,000
Then I might as well just keep calling you it.

155
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,600
She came from southwestern missouri, 

156
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,100
the hills outside (...)

157
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:52,100
Set in the cedars and oak trees somewhere 
between nowhere and goodbye.  

158
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:57,100
She grew up knowing one thing, she was trash.

159
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,400
It's for my dog.

160
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:17,400
She'd come 1800 miles 
but the (adultra) was still just over the hill. 

161
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,200
Working the bag boss.

162
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,200
I'm not your boss 
and that bag is working you.

163
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,300
Give her money back.

164
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,600
You sure?

165
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,900
How much's she paid?

166
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,100
6 Months.

167
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:05,500
Christ, 

168
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,000
no dont be a smart ass now will ya, 

169
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
woman thinks i'm gonna throw away 6 months worth of dues 
just to get rid of her she's out of her mind, 

170
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,400
but just dont encourage her, understand?  

171
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:22,400
What's danger doing out there? 
What's he looking at?

172
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,100
Looks like a bottle of water.

173
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,900
He pay his dues?

174
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,900
Dues? boy can't afford pants, 
you want him to pay dues?

175
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,900
Get out of my office.

176
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,800
Can't think it was the bag.  

177
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,700
I'm not a trainer 
but i can show you this too.

178
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:49,500
I appreciate any help i can get.

179
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,100
What you wanna do is take it to the mat see, 

180
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:57,100
he's constantly moving,moving towards you, 
moving around ya,and moving away from ya. 

181
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,500
Alright, now you dont want to hit him 
when he's coming toward ya 

182
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:05,500
cause what he's gonna do is just push you back 
and is gonna smuggle your punches take you by (respect), 

183
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,200
so you watch him real carefully, 
keep rotating, 

184
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,400
that keeps your head moving 
and keep one shoulder back 

185
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,600
so you're always ready to fire power shot, 

186
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,600
alright now go ahead now,good good, 
keep rotating,keep moving, that's it, 

187
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,300
good good, keep that chin tucked in, 

188
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,400
come around keep moving, keep moving, good ...

189
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,300
yeah?

190
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,200
Give it a few shots, 

191
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,300
tuck that chin in,tuck that chin in, 

192
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,400
that's good, that's good

193
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:44,400
now you get this down 
we'll put you on a speed bag?  

194
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,900
You do have a speed bag?

195
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,800
I'll just borrow it til i can buy my own.

196
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,400
Go on home now.

197
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,800
I'll walk out with you?

198
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,800
No i am home, see.

199
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,800
It's nice, 

200
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,400
would it bother you much 
if i worked a little longer?

201
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,400
Just pull the door closed when you leave.

202
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,200
Thank you.

203
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,900
If there's magic in boxing, 

204
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,800
its the magic of fighting battles 
beyond endurance, 

205
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,800
beyond cracked rips, ruptured kidneys 
and detached raetna's. 

206
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,700
It's the magic of risking everything 
for a dream that nobody see's but you.   

207
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Hey flip, hey flippie come here man, 
i think i found somebody you can beat.

208
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,000
I dont fights women.

209
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,800
Why not boot, it's perfect boot,
cause you know why, 

210
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:08,600
cause she are you, you could fight to him 
and then you could kiss to him, 

211
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,900
and then you fight to him one more time.

212
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,600
It's beautiful man, 
it's like poetry.

213
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,700
It's like poetry.

214
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,100
You've been reading that shit.

215
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:16,700
Thanks boss.

216
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,500
That's a girl man? 
I'll be damned flipper.

217
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Think your right.

218
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,500
Look at them itty bitty titties, 
there like mosquito bites, man there's barely even a mouth full.

219
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:31,100
Saw your last flash shot Will, spend so much time face down, 
I thought the canvas had titties.

220
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,600
Canvas has titties. 
Hey Look at me i'm Sherille.

221
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,000
Just humping the canvas, humping the floor.

222
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,300
C'mon bro, the floor having titties 
that's funny bro.

223
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,000
Shut up, what you laughing at? 

224
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Hold the bag stupid.  

225
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,200
Yo when they start 
making those tights for men flippie?

226
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,500
Alright that's enough, 
that's enough for today. 

227
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,000
I'll give you a ride.

228
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,800
Oh i can't frankie, middle's got a piano lesson, 
i told Grace i'd drive.

229
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,100
Oh, something wrong with Grace's car?

230
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,400
She hates that car, 

231
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,100
wants the old one back but dealer wont do it, 
says he already got a buyer.

232
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,900
Oh well maybe i should talk to the dealer?

233
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,900
I'd appreciate that.

234
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,200
Ok.

235
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,200
Thanks.  

236
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,700
(...) today doesn't want one.

237
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,300
You ever do any work around here?

238
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:01,300
Not my job i'd worry about if i was you.

239
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,400
Little girl tends to be coming along.

240
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:10,400
Yeah, almost like someones been helping her.

241
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,500
She might just be a natural.  
Looks like She's got something.

242
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:21,000
She's got my speed bag, 
that's what she's got.

243
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,600
I wonder How the hell she got that.

244
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,600
I wonder.

245
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,300
I'm gonna need that speed bag back.

246
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,300
This bag?

247
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:41,700
Yes that bag, that's my bag 
and if your hitting it people will think i'm training ya.

248
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,700
Is that such a bad thing boss?

249
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:48,700
Yes, yes it is everytime you touch it 
your losing me business out here.

250
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,000
I Got it (didn't) embarassing myself.

251
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,400
Well I can't just lend it to anybody you know.

252
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,400
I understand.

253
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,800
Look you seem like a nice girl, 
can i give you some advice?

254
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,500
I'd appreciate that.

255
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:13,400
Your gonna find a trainer either in this gym 
or somewhere else that's gonna wanna train a girl, 

256
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,700
it's the latest freak show out there, 

257
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:20,700
but the only trouble is your gonna be 
they're wasting your time because your too old.

258
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,200
I dont feel that old.

259
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,200
Well neither do I but you don't see me 
fighting 21 yr olds do ya, 

260
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,100
it takes about 4 years to train a fighter.  

261
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,700
HOw old are you?

262
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,100
31, until my next birthday.

263
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,700
Well there you go. 31. 

264
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,100
You wouldn't start traing to be a ballerina 
at 31 now would ya?

265
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,500
Already been working it for 3years.

266
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
And you can't hit a speed bag? 

267
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,500
What kind of training is that?

268
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,100
Never had any boss.

269
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:56,100
Well i hate to say it but it shows. 
SOmebody's gotta be honest with ya.  

270
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,400
I hate to be the one to tell you the truth.

271
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,400
Ya, well sorry for using your bag Mr dunn.

272
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,700
Your not gonna cry now are ya?

273
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,800
No sir.

274
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,800
Ya, Here, keep the god damn thing.

275
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,400
No you need it.

276
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,400
No take the bag, 
haven't seen it in 20yrs anyway. 

277
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:30,200
I've had 3 since then, 
just uh, just enjoy it will ya?

278
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,700
I'll just borrow it till i buy my own.

279
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,700
Just dont lose it.

280
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,700
I know HOgan, your guy's the champ 
so we dont split 50's 

281
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:52,600
but if i dont see 40%, 

282
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:57,600
look you call me back with 60/40 
or dont call me back at all.

283
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,900
Hey Willie.

284
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,500
Hey Frankie.

285
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,000
Is something wrong?

286
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,200
I'm sorry to come on your house like this, 

287
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,100
I know you dont like people dropping in.

288
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,600
Oh your not people Willie, 
your welcome anytime come on in.

289
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,100
I wanted to thank you 
for getting Grace's car back.

290
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:26,100
Oh you dont have to thank me. 
Paying an extra 1000 dollars for your own  car (...) is a favor.

291
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,000
Gracey broke down crying when she saw it.

292
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,700
Really?

293
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,000
I also needed to talk with you about business.

294
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Oh yeah well i just got off the phone with Hogan, 

295
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,600
we're all set for september, 
everything but the splinter.

296
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,300
I gotta leave you Frankie.

297
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:49,200
What?  

298
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,900
Willie the title is just 2 fights away. 

299
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,300
It aint that, it's like you said, 

300
00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:00,300
i got one shot,
if i win i got to make as much i can while i can.  

301
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,600
I need somebody in the action 
that can make things happen, 

302
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,700
and i got to make a change before the fight. 

303
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,500
Only way this guy said he'd take me is 
if he took me to the title.

304
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,300
So i get to the title fight, 
and this guy takes you there.

305
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:19,200
Only way he'd do it, i'm sorry Frankie, 

306
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,200
i'm no longer waiting on a title, 
I wish you could have been with me.

307
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,600
Mickie mac's a business man, 
he can't teach ya nothing.

308
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,600
You already taught me everything I need to know.

309
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,400
There's some things people just dont wanna hear. 

310
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,000
And I challenge the motor city cobra, 

311
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Thomas Hitman Earns to fight me 
for the welter weight championship of the whole world.

312
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,600
Danger, i'm wearing these mits for a reason.

313
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,200
Just working on my foot work mr (name).

314
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,200
Danger you through a punch 
you get the hell out of this gym.

315
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,400
Danger, i want you thinking bout that punch i'll brb.

316
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,400
I'm, i'm thinking 
how i'm gonna hit it hard for ya mr (name).

317
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:38,500
No one had the heart 
to tell Danger Earns retired years ago.

318
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:45,100
(language study)

319
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,200
Heard about Willie, it's cold, it's dead cold, 

320
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,800
plus it wouldn't be so bad if you weren't so damn old.

321
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,600
Yeah well at least i can see through both eyes.

322
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,800
Mmmhmm didn't do you a lot good tho did it?

323
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,800
Well i got the gym, 
dont need to be training fighters at my age.  

324
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,900
Willie tell you why?

325
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,700
Cause Mickie, mickie's got the connections.

326
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,600
It aint about connections frankie, 
it's about you not believing in him.

327
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,200
Well I found him, I stuck with him for 8 years 
how's that for not believing in him.

328
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,600
You could have gotten him a title fight 2 years ago, 

329
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,400
now he knew that 
i'm amazed he stayed around this long.

330
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,600
Yeah well getting there 
and taking home the belt are 2 different things.  

331
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,800
What was i supposed to do, 
just put him in over his head, not protect him?

332
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,700
Oh you were protecting him from the championship?

333
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,900
Yea.

334
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,600
Well Now that makes sense.

335
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,100
Well What about you scrap, 
what did your manager do? 

336
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:49,000
You were a hell of a fighter, a lot better than Willie, 

337
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,700
he get you a title fight or ..

338
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:55,700
did he just bust you out banging your head against other people's fist 
until you lost your eye?

339
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:00,400
I had my shot, I went out swinging 
and no man can say i didnt.  

340
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,800
Ya well i remember, and excuse me, 

341
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:07,800
If I didn't want my fighter spending the 2nd half of his life 
cleanin up other people's spit.

342
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,400
Ya right, like your the smart one, your the one learning greek.

343
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,300
It's galac.

344
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:21,300
Well you just protected yourself out of a championship fight, 
how do you say that in galac.

345
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,200
Boxing is an unnatural act, 

346
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,900
cause everything in it is backwards, 

347
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,500
You wanna move to the left, you dont step left, 

348
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,600
you push on the right toe, 

349
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,100
to move right you use your left toe, 

350
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:13,300
instead of running from the pain 
like a sane person would do, 

351
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:18,300
you step into it.

352
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:42,900
Everything in boxing is backwards.

353
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,800
Cheeseburger?

354
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,300
You bought me a cheeseburger?

355
00:30:59,300 --> 00:30:59,900
Ya.

356
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,900
I never see you buy anybody a cheeseburger.

357
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,400
Well i couldn't eat it, 
and i ordered it. You want it?

358
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:09,800
Well I guess I plan go back to spending.

359
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,400
Did you watch the fight?

360
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:16,400
Yeah I watched it. Willie did good.

361
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,700
That's what you got to say?

362
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:22,800
Willie won didn't he? He did good.

363
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:27,100
So you been working on yourself, 
learning to open up that's good work.

364
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,200
You watch it?

365
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,400
Yeah i got HBO.

366
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:37,400
How could you afford HBO?  
How long have i been telling you to save your money?

367
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:43,600
Ever since i fought Louis typhoon johnson at the stadium club 
in tupulo mississippi.

368
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,500
That (...)?

369
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:50,400
Yeah manager ran off, left you and me to hitch home, 

370
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,000
don't you remember nothing?

371
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,500
Well I remember walking half way 
and thinking i was gonna be lynched.

372
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:00,600
I remember you leaving me with my dick in my hand 
behind that gas station.

373
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,100
Yeah well i got a ride, 
the guy took off before i hardly closed the door, 

374
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:07,000
had to walk back 2 miles.

375
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
YOur conscience got the better of you that's why.

376
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,900
What the hells that?

377
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:20,900
It's her birthday.

378
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,200
Your not breathing right, 
that's why your pantering. 

379
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:49,100
So it's your birthday huh, how olds that make ya?

380
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,000
I'm 32 mr dunn, 

381
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,400
and i'm here celebrating the fact 
that i spend another year scraping dishes and waitressing 

382
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,900
which is what I've been doing since 13, 

383
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:02,900
and according to you i'll be 37 
before i can even throw a decent punch 

384
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,200
which i have to work on this speed bag 
for a month (...) god's simple truth. 

385
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,500
other truth is, my brother's in prison, 

386
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,100
my sister cheats on welfare 
by pretending one of her babies is still alive, 

387
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,700
my daddies dead, and my momma weighs 312lbs. 

388
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,200
If i was thinking straight i'd go back home, 

389
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:25,200
find a used trailer, 
buy a deep fryer and some oreos, 

390
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,400
problem is this the only thing 
i ever felt good doing.  

391
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:33,100
If i'm too old for this then i got nothing. 

392
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:37,200
that enough truth to see to you?

393
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,300
This your speed bag?

394
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:43,300
If yours behind the counter, 
wish i could say wheres it at

395
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,800
HOld it, hold it, 
i'll show you a few things, 

396
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,400
and then we'll get you a trainer.

397
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,200
NO sorry.

398
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,100
Your in a position to be negotiate?

399
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:59,100
Yes sir, because i know 
if you train me right i'm gonna be a champ, 

400
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,600
i've seen you looking at me.

401
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,500
Yeah out of pitty.

402
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:08,500
Dont' you say that, 
dont you say that if it aint true. 

403
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,800
I want a trainer, i dont want charity, 
and i dont want favors, 

404
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:23,600
if your not interested than 
i got more celebrating to do.

405
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Stop stop stop, god damnit stop.  

406
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:34,200
What the hell are you doing? 

407
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,500
Ok, if i'm gonna take you on...

408
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,200
You wont never regret it.

409
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,400
Look just listen to me...
If i take you on...

410
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,400
I'll promise I'll work so hard.

411
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,000
God this is a mistake already.

412
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,300
mmm mmm i'm listening boss.

413
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,200
If i take you on, you dont say anything, 

414
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,000
you dont question me, dont ask why, 

415
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,300
you dont say nigger something maybe yes frankie 

416
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,700
and i'm gonna try to 
forget the fact that your a girl.

417
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,100
It's all i ask.

418
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,900
And dont come crying to me 
if you get hurt.Alrighty.

419
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,400
We got a deal.

420
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,600
NO not quite, 

421
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:17,600
I'm gonna teach ya how to fight 
then we get you a manager and i'm off down the road.

422
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,800
WEll i hate to argue..

423
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,800
Dont argue with me that's the only way we're doing it 
I teach you all you need to know 
and then you go off you make a million dollars, 

424
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,300
I dont care, get your teeth knocked out, i dont care, 

425
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,700
I dont wanna hear about it either way, 
that's just the way its gonna be, 

426
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:36,700
its the only way i'll do it.

427
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,000
All right,

428
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,800
Now one of the things i've noticed around the gym 
is you never move your feet. 

429
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,000
You stand there just flat footed. 

430
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,700
You gotta move your feet, that's one of the best things 
i'm gonna be able to teach ya. 

431
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,000
so here's what you do, 

432
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
You get yourself, bend your knees, 
get in an athletic position, 

433
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,600
look like your gonna hit something.

434
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,700
Move em how boss?

435
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,400
Just go hit the bag.

436
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,200
Stop.

437
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,600
What i do wrong?

438
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,200
Ok You did two things wrong.

439
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,500
1 is you asked a question and 2 is 
you asked another question. 

440
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,400
Now What i want you to do is not about hitting it hard,

441
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,200
is how good you hit it. 

442
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,700
so watch me, 

443
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:32,300
and you can count with  me if you want, 
just count on a one count.

444
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,600
Can you show me that again?

445
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,900
Just say one please.

446
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,900
One.

447
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,800
Ok one.

448
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,700
One.

449
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:43,900
ok Yeah just say one, 
thats good that's good, 

450
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:48,900
then i move over to my right foot, 
you see my weight is shifting to my right foot 

451
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,700
then i hit it with the back of my hands, 

452
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:55,200
thin ice, thin ice pick then i come over 

453
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:00,200
and i shift to my left foot, 
and i hit it with my right hand, 

454
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:05,500
ice picking it again....

455
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:26,100
Just do it like that, keep practicing.

456
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
You show em how to stand, 
keep their legs under their shoulders. 

457
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:12,100
To make a fighter, 
you gotta strip em down to bare wood. 

458
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,300
You can't just tell em to 
forget everything you know, 

459
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:26,300
you gotta make them forget it 
in their bones. 

460
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,100
make em so tired they only listen to you, 

461
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:36,100
only hear your voice, 
only do what you say and nothing else. 

462
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:58,700
Show em how to keep their balance 
and take it away from the other guy. 

463
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:09,800
How to generate momentum off your right toe 

464
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:14,800
and how to flex your knees when fire a jab. 

465
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:23,700
how to fight backin up so the other guy 
doesn't wanna come after ya, 

466
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,000
then you gotta show em all over again, 

467
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
over and over and over 
til they think they were born that way.

468
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:50,600
Think i'm ready for a fight boss?

469
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Hey, come here. 

470
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,000
Your not breathing.

471
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,300
Hate to disagree with you.

472
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:27,300
Everytime you get into pressure your holding your breath, 
now stop doing that.

473
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:31,700
Ok, but other than that 
i'm doing pretty good right? 

474
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,800
I mean for a girl.

475
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:38,000
I dont train girls.

476
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,600
Think i might be ready for a fight boss?

477
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,100
You get a manager and we'll find out wont we.

478
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:49,100
I'd like to but you been keeping me too busy.  

479
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
You got any family boss?

480
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,100
What?

481
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:03,700
You spending all this time with me 
I didn't know if you had any?

482
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:08,700
No, well i got a daughter, katie.

483
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,900
That's family.

484
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,500
WE're not exactly close.

485
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,000
How much she weigh?

486
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,600
What?

487
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:23,600
Trouble in my family comes by the pound.

488
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,300
Yeah, not very big, 

489
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:33,300
used to be real athletic, 
dont know if she kept it up.

490
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:43,500
So what do you think, Im ready for a fight?

491
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:54,800
Hey Sally, come here for a minute will ya?

492
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,100
Frankie i need to see you in the back 
for a minute ok? 

493
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,500
can i see you a minute?

494
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:05,800
Sally here is a real good manager, 
has a couple of golden glove boys, 

495
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,800
looking for a girl sally?

496
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,500
Well Looking for a good one.

497
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:15,500
See there you go. 

498
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:20,800
Nice working with you girlie.

499
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,700
What you want?

500
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,900
Nothing.

501
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:28,400
My my, i've been watching you work, 
you got a hell of a left.

502
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,800
Thank you.

503
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,800
So You wanna give this a try see if it's a fit?

504
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,400
Yeah sure.

505
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:44,400
Good, cause i think your ready for a fight.

506
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,400
What am i doing wrong Sally? 
everytime Im gettin (...) on me.

507
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,400
Your doing great, your wearing her down, 
just keep punching.

508
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,300
I aint doing great, i'm losing.

509
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:11,300
Your wearing her down.

510
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,700
Nice night aint it?

511
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,500
Jesus Christ.

512
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:40,500
That's (name) washington's girl, 
hell of a fighter, 11-0.

513
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:46,800
Your lefts, keep your left up.

514
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:53,400
(name) has a lot of good fighters, 
gots julia (name) lightweight champ.

515
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,700
Your left damnit.

516
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:03,300
Wouldn't have been my choice for a first fight 
but Sally's a good manager, 

517
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,000
must think she can take her.

518
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,300
Jesus age, your left, keep your left up.

519
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:14,300
You thinks she can hear you from back here?

520
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:23,400
Course if maggie loses, 
wouldn't mean a thing to Sally, 

521
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,500
might even help him on his card gets another win, 

522
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:32,400
Lonnie might let Sally lightweight fight 
julia (name) for the title.

523
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,300
Sally's trying to set a fight with julia?

524
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:39,400
Hey what do i know, 
i just come cause i enjoy the fights.

525
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:44,400
My god.

526
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:48,600
Hey come here, come here, 

527
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,800
your dropping your left hand, quit dropping your left hand.

528
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,200
Hey frankie do you mind not talking to my fighter?

529
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:58,400
Your doing a hell of a job of it sally, 
is this the way you advise your lightweight?

530
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,200
Dunn, what the hell are you doing?

531
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,800
I'm talking, what you doing?

532
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,800
Is this your fighter?

533
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,100
It's my fighter.

534
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,600
It aint fitting real well sally.

535
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,900
Fine, you take her, 
she can't fight worth a shit anyway.

536
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:13,600
Somebody tell me what's going on.

537
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,300
Look I was late, 
Sally was just subbin for me.

538
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:21,200
You telilng me that this is your fighter?

539
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,300
Yeah this is my fighter.

540
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,700
Then you got 10 seconds.

541
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,300
Ok,(..) and then 
i throw a punch and it keeps dropping.

542
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,000
Let it drop.

543
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
That'd be a lot easier.

544
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,600
She thinks she knows you that's all, 
everytime you drop it she comes right over the top, 

545
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,000
so you just wait for her you see, 
that's all she's thinkin about, 

546
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,400
and When she cocks that big right hand 
do ya hear me?

547
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,100
I hear ya boss.

548
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:46,200
When she does you step to the side,  
come over wit a goodnight hook. YOu got one?

549
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,300
Got it right here.

550
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:50,200
Fighter i'm calling it.

551
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,200
Ok, go give it to her.

552
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,000
The body knows what fighters dont, 
how to protect itself. 

553
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,700
A neck can only twist so far, twist it just a hair more 

554
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:03,000
and the body says hey i'll take it from here, 

555
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,500
cuz obviously you dont know what your doing.

556
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,400
Neutral corner.

557
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,400
See the way she did that? 
Sugar ray would do that.Girls got sugar.

558
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:18,700
Lie down now, rest and we'll talk about this 
when you regain your senses. 

559
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,000
IT's called a knock out mechanism.

560
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Dont' get carried away now.

561
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,900
You uh, you forgot the rule, 
now what is the rule?

562
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,100
Keep my left up?

563
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:36,900
Is To protect yourself at all times.

564
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,500
Now what is the rule?

565
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,100
Protect myself at all times.

566
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,000
Good good.

567
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,100
You gave me away 
how is that protecting me?

568
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,100
It wasn't.

569
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:51,900
It's ok, i'll work on my left boss.

570
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:55,400
Drink your water.

571
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,400
Other than that how'd i do?

572
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,300
Fine, you did fine.

573
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:05,000
You gonna leave me again?

574
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Never, that place you worked today, 
have homemade lemon moran pie?

575
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,600
Sure.

576
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,600
Not the kind with the canned filling crap.

577
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:19,600
Big can, yaaa size, 
says homemade on the label.

578
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,300
I want you to take the weekend off.

579
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:25,000
It's only thursday.

580
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,200
You gonna argue with me?

581
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,200
Know better than do that boss.

582
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,200
well... good.

583
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,200
All fighters are pig headed someway or another, 

584
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:38,000
some part of them always thinks 
they know better than you about something.

585
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,000
can you uh spare a few minutes 
for the immaculate conception?

586
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:47,700
Truth is, even if they're wrong, 

587
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:50,800
even if that one thing 
is gonna be the ruin of them, 

588
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,800
if you can beat that last bet out of them, 
then they aint fighters at all.

589
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,800
Thought i said see you monday?

590
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,900
You Sure did boss.

591
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:01,400
Was last night.

592
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:06,400
You said not to argue with ya.

593
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,300
Damn woman wont do a thing i tell her.

594
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,400
Want my advice?

595
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,900
What?

596
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:26,100
Where are your shoes?

597
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:29,800
There in a feet.

598
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,300
You got big holes in your socks.

599
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:36,100
There only not that big.

600
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:40,100
Didn't i give you money for some new ones?

601
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:45,100
These are my sleeping socks, 
my feet like a little air at night.

602
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,000
How come you are wearing them in the day time then?

603
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Cause my daytime socks got too many holes in them.

604
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:59,200
Well if i give you some more money 
buy some new socks, please?

605
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,000
Well i'd be tempted but, 

606
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
i couldn't say for sure, might find it's way to the track.

607
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:49,500
Didn't take maggie long to hit a strive.

608
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,600
I've got the breathing thing down.

609
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:04,000
Nah you aint breathing right, 
cuz your knocking them down in the first round, that's what.

610
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,300
I thought that was the point.

611
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:08,100
The point is to get good, 

612
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:13,100
you can't get good if you keep knockin em out in the first round, 
how am i gonna get you fights? 

613
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,500
Nobody wants to see their fighter embarrased.

614
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:20,600
Why am i still doing 4 rounders box?

615
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,000
Cause you haven't got the lungs 
for 6 rounds, that's why.

616
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I do if i keep knocking em out the first round.

617
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:35,200
Frankie made her fight one more 4 rounder, 
just to let her know who was boss.

618
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,000
Sorry boss.

619
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Maggie left no doubt about it. 

620
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:07,600
The first 6 rounder didn't go quite as smooth. 

621
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,200
Maggie didn't knock her out 
til the end of the first round, 

622
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:44,200
after that no manager wanted to put his fighter in with maggie. 

623
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:51,000
Frankie had to go into his pocket to get a decent fights.  

624
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:56,000
sweeting the purse by paying managers on the side.

625
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:12,300
That only worked for so long, 
then frankie did something he hated doing, 
he took a chance.

626
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,000
He moved her up in class, 
that could have been a mistake. 

627
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:11,600
Damn, Damn, Damn, 

628
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:16,600
2 seconds will ya, just 2 seconds. 
Your nose is broke.

629
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:18,900
Dang, fix it.

630
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,000
I can't, i can't.

631
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,100
You can fix it.

632
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,900
I can't, i've gotta call it.

633
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:25,300
I've seen what you can do, fix it.

634
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:29,800
Look i can snap it back into place 
but i can't stop the bleeding, 
the ring doctor's gonna call it.

635
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:34,400
Please Frankie please stop the blood i can beat her.

636
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:39,400
By doing this.

637
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:59,500
Inhale, inhale, breath in.

638
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:11,800
Ok huh?

639
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,100
Yeah it's okay.

640
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:19,100
Alright You got 20 seconds before this turns into a geiser 
and it's gonna spray all over the front row.  

641
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:24,400
20 seconds that's all you got, 
now get going.

642
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,700
What ya reading?

643
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:12,600
What she saying?

644
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,000
Wants to know what your reading.

645
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,100
Its Yates, keep your head back.

646
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:24,000
Why won't ya talk a little yates to her, 
show her what a treat that is.

647
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,200
When the hell they gonna get to her?

648
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:29,200
I'm ok frankie.

649
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,600
What you learn tonight?

650
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,500
Always protect myself.

651
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:33,700
Whats the rule?

652
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,700
Always protect myself.

653
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,800
Margret Fitgerald?

654
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:41,800
Here.

655
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:47,100
I'll be right here.

656
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,800
HOw you doing?

657
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:58,900
Me?

658
00:55:58,900 --> 00:55:59,400
Yeah you.

659
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:04,400
I'm not the one who's hurt.

660
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,100
Broken noise dont hurt that much.

661
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:12,500
Why you telling me that?

662
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:14,100
No reason.

663
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:18,600
But some wounds are too deep 
or too close to the bone, 

664
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:23,300
and no matter how hard you work at it, 
you just can't stop the bleeding.

665
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,100
Did you write your daughter?

666
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:28,100
Every week.

667
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:33,100
I've no idea why you come to church.

668
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:07,500
After a 12 straight knock out, 
frankie got a couple of real good offers, 

669
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:14,800
the first was to fight billy the blue bare osterman 
for the wba welter weight title.
