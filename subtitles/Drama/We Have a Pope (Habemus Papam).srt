1
00:03:44,842 --> 00:03:46,593
Just a moment!

2
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:09,532
Here's the Archbishop of Palermo
Saverio Cincotta.

3
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:11,993
This is his third Conclave.

4
00:04:12,036 --> 00:04:14,913
Cardinal Masao Takada...

5
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,041
archivist and librarian
of the Holy Roman Church.

6
00:04:18,376 --> 00:04:22,045
We can see Sidi Kamara,
followed by Koma Mbosou.

7
00:04:22,171 --> 00:04:26,549
As you know the African continent
has never... Here's Ricardo Aguilar.

8
00:04:26,676 --> 00:04:29,678
Who could be
the first South American Pope.

9
00:04:29,762 --> 00:04:32,931
And the cardinal from Sri Lanka,
Don Somasiry.

10
00:04:33,057 --> 00:04:37,769
We'll try approaching
Cardinal Massucci for a word.

11
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:41,314
Cardinal, could we have a statement?

12
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,318
Obviously they can't
answer our questions.

13
00:04:45,444 --> 00:04:50,949
And now, we can see
the Syrian Patriarch of Antioch...

14
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:55,328
Simon Al Shuriani, Prefect of the
Congregation of Eastern Churches.

15
00:04:55,413 --> 00:04:57,706
Here's who we're all waiting for:

16
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,334
The Vatican spokesman,
Marcin Rajski is approaching us...

17
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:04,713
- maybe to ask us.
- Thank you very much.

18
00:05:04,797 --> 00:05:08,675
- We must ask you to leave now.
- He asks us to leave...

19
00:05:08,718 --> 00:05:10,593
but thanks the press.

20
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,472
- Maybe a long shot of the Sistine Chapel.
- No, thank you.

21
00:05:14,557 --> 00:05:18,685
He thanks us very much...

22
00:05:18,728 --> 00:05:23,231
but our work ends here.
We can't get that shot.

23
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:26,234
Here, we know them all,
Cardinal Dean Gregori...

24
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,862
the favored of the Conclave.

25
00:05:28,988 --> 00:05:33,742
As of this moment
the 108 cardinal electors...

26
00:05:33,826 --> 00:05:37,871
will be isolated from
the rest of the world.

27
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:30,382
Gregori, what do we do?

28
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:33,301
- Has the power failed?
- What else could it be?

29
00:06:33,386 --> 00:06:37,389
- Please, stay calm.
- Any candles?

30
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:41,684
- They're not allowed. - Why?
- They ruin the frescoes.

31
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:44,687
Do they know outside
that we're in darkness?

32
00:06:44,814 --> 00:06:47,941
Of course they do...

33
00:06:48,067 --> 00:06:51,694
and they're already fixing it.

34
00:06:52,947 --> 00:06:56,449
- Who's that? What happened?
- It's Cardinal Brummer.

35
00:06:56,575 --> 00:06:58,451
I fell.

36
00:06:58,577 --> 00:07:02,080
It's nothing, I'm already getting up.

37
00:07:02,164 --> 00:07:03,832
- Are you alright?
- Yes, thank you.

38
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,959
- Is everything alright?
- I said: Yes!

39
00:07:06,043 --> 00:07:07,794
Are you okay, Brummer?

40
00:07:07,837 --> 00:07:11,214
- I didn't hurt myself.
- Your back, ankle?

41
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:15,343
- I'm not hurt at all!
- Are you sure?

42
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:17,971
Please, try not to move around.

43
00:07:19,723 --> 00:07:22,809
Let's return to our seats.

44
00:07:22,852 --> 00:07:26,729
Pick things up...

45
00:08:42,806 --> 00:08:45,266
Not me, Lord, not me!

46
00:08:49,688 --> 00:08:52,065
Not me, Lord, don't choose me!

47
00:08:53,651 --> 00:08:55,401
I'm not up to it.

48
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,906
Not me, Lord, please.

49
00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:01,824
Not me.

50
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:04,827
Not me, Lord, please.

51
00:09:04,954 --> 00:09:07,830
Not me, Lord.

52
00:09:18,342 --> 00:09:20,843
No, I said no!

53
00:09:46,328 --> 00:09:48,204
Gregori.

54
00:09:48,247 --> 00:09:50,123
Bikila.

55
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,126
Aguilar.

56
00:09:55,004 --> 00:09:55,548
Gregori.

57
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:07,390
- Where does Gregori stand?
- 13.

58
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:09,517
Gregori 18, Bikila 11.

59
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:12,729
- Bikila.
- Gregori 21.

60
00:10:12,771 --> 00:10:15,773
- Aguilar 18.
- Gregori and Bikila 15.

61
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:17,650
Bikila.

62
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:23,239
- Aguilar.
- Just a moment!

63
00:10:23,282 --> 00:10:25,033
Gregori.

64
00:10:25,117 --> 00:10:26,534
Lucci.

65
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,288
The smoke's black,
the Pope still hasn't been elected.

66
00:10:30,414 --> 00:10:32,874
The smoke is white!

67
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,918
The thousands of faithful here
in St. Peter's Square...

68
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:39,255
joyfully applaud the news.

69
00:10:39,298 --> 00:10:42,675
But the bells aren't ringing.

70
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,763
Maybe the smoke only looked white.

71
00:10:46,805 --> 00:10:49,891
I can hear my colleagues
saying the smoke is black.

72
00:10:49,933 --> 00:10:54,020
The smoke, actually...

73
00:10:54,772 --> 00:10:57,899
Yes, the smoke is black.

74
00:10:57,941 --> 00:11:00,193
Yes, it's black, nothing doing.

75
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:04,072
The smoke will last a while
because, as well as the ballots...

76
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:08,076
their personal notes
will be burned too.

77
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,038
Nothing regarding the Conclave
can filter through to the outside.

78
00:11:15,084 --> 00:11:17,043
Aguilar.

79
00:11:18,671 --> 00:11:20,463
Gregori.

80
00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:22,340
Lucci.

81
00:11:24,843 --> 00:11:26,177
Bikila.

82
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,347
Another black smoke signal.

83
00:11:29,473 --> 00:11:33,601
The cardinals in the Conclave still
haven't managed to elect a Pope.

84
00:11:33,686 --> 00:11:36,813
A second vote will be cast
this afternoon.

85
00:11:36,855 --> 00:11:41,609
We don't know if the favorites are
still Gregori, Aguilar and Bikila.

86
00:12:13,642 --> 00:12:14,254
Melville.

87
00:12:41,754 --> 00:12:43,379
Aguilar.

88
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:44,910
Melville.

89
00:12:52,055 --> 00:12:53,639
Cevasco.

90
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:55,420
Melville.

91
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:02,648
Aguilar.

92
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:04,429
Melville.

93
00:13:29,343 --> 00:13:30,843
Aguilar.

94
00:13:32,346 --> 00:13:34,722
Melville.

95
00:14:05,128 --> 00:14:09,632
Do you accept your canonical election
as Supreme Pontiff.

96
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:22,478
Do you accept your canonical election
as Supreme Pontiff?

97
00:14:46,795 --> 00:14:47,295
Yes.

98
00:16:01,745 --> 00:16:04,205
- Holiness...
- What are you doing?

99
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:11,253
- What happens now?
- You can just give a blessing...

100
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:18,135
or, as our deceased
beloved Pope did the first time...

101
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:22,223
address the faithful with a speech.

102
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:40,408
Dear brothers and sisters...

103
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:10,312
Nuntio vobis gaudium magnum,
habemus Papam!

104
00:17:17,696 --> 00:17:21,699
Eminentissimum ac reverendissimum...

105
00:17:54,983 --> 00:17:56,942
Help me.

106
00:17:59,738 --> 00:18:01,739
I can't do this.

107
00:18:03,742 --> 00:18:05,993
I can't do this!

108
00:20:03,612 --> 00:20:08,949
Holy Father...

109
00:20:09,868 --> 00:20:12,369
you mustn't worry.

110
00:20:12,495 --> 00:20:16,874
By bestowing this charge, God also
gives you help to accomplish it...

111
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,379
and the strength to sustain the
weight of this great responsibility.

112
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:27,509
Would you like something hot?
Herbal tea?

113
00:20:30,138 --> 00:20:33,349
You could retire to your apartments...

114
00:20:33,391 --> 00:20:36,852
and when you're ready,
I'll take you to the balcony.

115
00:20:39,731 --> 00:20:41,273
No.

116
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:52,493
The Conclave has indeed
elected the Holy Father...

117
00:20:52,535 --> 00:20:56,914
who, aware
of this great responsibility...

118
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,043
feels the need to retire in prayer.

119
00:21:02,045 --> 00:21:05,673
This unusual gesture
is also an act of humility...

120
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:10,135
which we are sure
you will want to respect.

121
00:21:10,178 --> 00:21:11,929
Please.

122
00:21:13,056 --> 00:21:17,518
I believe I express the sentiments
of my colleagues worldwide.

123
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,938
We respect His Holiness' will...

124
00:21:21,022 --> 00:21:25,067
all we ask is his name. Only that!

125
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,319
Tell us if it's one of these 8.

126
00:21:27,404 --> 00:21:30,197
Aguilar? Gregori?

127
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:34,034
- Bikila? - We believe...
- Todorov?

128
00:21:34,077 --> 00:21:37,162
We believe within a few hours...

129
00:21:37,205 --> 00:21:42,167
the Pontiff will introduce himself
to the faithful from the balcony.

130
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,586
At that point you also will meet him...

131
00:21:44,713 --> 00:21:49,300
and we will celebrate
the new Pontificate together.

132
00:21:49,342 --> 00:21:51,093
Thank you.

133
00:23:39,327 --> 00:23:41,912
- Do you feel any pain?
- No.

134
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:48,961
- Headache?
- Yes... no.

135
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,055
How is your blood pressure usually?

136
00:24:06,229 --> 00:24:09,356
- Good.
- I was sure.

137
00:24:10,358 --> 00:24:12,734
I was sure.

138
00:24:16,739 --> 00:24:19,741
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

139
00:24:19,826 --> 00:24:21,869
Good day!

140
00:24:21,953 --> 00:24:23,954
Good morning!

141
00:24:25,081 --> 00:24:29,501
We're going to Borgo Pio
for breakfast.

142
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:33,881
What?

143
00:24:34,007 --> 00:24:41,346
There's a place where they make
delicious cream-filled doughnuts.

144
00:24:41,389 --> 00:24:45,726
Then I'd like to take them
to the Quirinale Museum.

145
00:24:45,768 --> 00:24:48,896
There's a wonderful
Caravaggio exhibit.

146
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,648
I don't think you can.

147
00:24:51,774 --> 00:24:55,652
Why not? Our task is done.

148
00:24:55,737 --> 00:25:01,033
How could you think
of leaving the Vatican at this time?

149
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:05,787
The Holy Father will recover very soon
and we must be at his side!

150
00:25:05,872 --> 00:25:09,374
Yes, but we won't go far.

151
00:25:09,417 --> 00:25:14,171
We'll take our cell phones,
so you can contact us at any time.

152
00:25:14,297 --> 00:25:17,424
I'd like to remind you
of John Paul the First's precedent...

153
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:20,552
who, after his election and
appearance on the balcony...

154
00:25:20,678 --> 00:25:23,430
made us stay an extra day.

155
00:25:23,515 --> 00:25:25,265
Here it is.

156
00:25:25,308 --> 00:25:27,059
Alright, if it's only for a day...

157
00:25:27,185 --> 00:25:30,521
No cardinal shall have
contact with the outside...

158
00:25:30,563 --> 00:25:33,690
until the election is over...

159
00:25:33,816 --> 00:25:36,318
and publicly announced.

160
00:25:40,573 --> 00:25:44,034
Could I at least get a cappuccino?
Not too hot!

161
00:25:45,703 --> 00:25:49,915
- What will we have?
- Orange juice.

162
00:25:51,793 --> 00:25:54,336
A cappuccino, very little froth.

163
00:26:11,938 --> 00:26:15,983
The Holy Father
has been seen by a physician...

164
00:26:16,109 --> 00:26:19,486
who said
he's in good physical condition.

165
00:26:19,571 --> 00:26:21,863
But the Holy Father isn't improving.

166
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:26,451
Given the gravity of the situation...

167
00:26:26,494 --> 00:26:28,704
the cardinals
said they're in favor of...

168
00:26:28,746 --> 00:26:31,248
Professor Brezzi,
may I present Cardinal Gregori.

169
00:26:31,374 --> 00:26:35,460
I know you, your picture
was in the papers.

170
00:26:35,503 --> 00:26:37,504
He was the front-runner, right?

171
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:43,260
The cardinals are in favor
of trying psychoanalysis...

172
00:26:43,386 --> 00:26:48,140
despite the natural skepticism you can
well imagine. - Yes, I can imagine.

173
00:26:48,224 --> 00:26:54,021
I think it's unnecessary to remind you...

174
00:26:54,105 --> 00:26:59,610
- the concepts of soul and subconscious cannot possibly co-exist.
- Okay, we'll see.

175
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:03,739
What's his name?
I don't recognize him.

176
00:27:03,781 --> 00:27:06,533
Who did you elect? What's his name?

177
00:27:06,618 --> 00:27:10,412
- Call him Holiness.
- It's a little too much!

178
00:27:10,538 --> 00:27:16,418
In a therapeutic situation,
a name can give life...

179
00:27:16,544 --> 00:27:18,378
to the relationship...

180
00:27:18,421 --> 00:27:22,299
Okay, it doesn't matter,
we cannot know his name.

181
00:27:22,383 --> 00:27:24,926
I'm off, I'll leave the two of you.

182
00:27:25,053 --> 00:27:28,680
- Where can the Pope and I meet?
- Here.

183
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:33,060
Good morning.

184
00:27:33,144 --> 00:27:37,439
- How do you feel?
- I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.

185
00:27:37,565 --> 00:27:40,150
Don't worry.

186
00:27:40,193 --> 00:27:42,194
Fine, we'll begin now.

187
00:27:42,278 --> 00:27:44,946
Thank you all!

188
00:27:52,914 --> 00:27:55,082
Right...

189
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:56,833
well...

190
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:02,339
All that's happened recently...

191
00:28:02,423 --> 00:28:05,217
your election and everything...

192
00:28:05,343 --> 00:28:08,720
we'll lay it aside for the moment.

193
00:28:08,805 --> 00:28:13,934
I'd like us to begin with retracing...

194
00:28:13,976 --> 00:28:16,812
reliving your emotions...

195
00:28:16,854 --> 00:28:18,980
Wait.

196
00:28:21,109 --> 00:28:25,112
- I suppose I can't ask...
- Absolutely not.

197
00:28:25,196 --> 00:28:28,198
I was sure that anything about sex.

198
00:28:28,241 --> 00:28:30,325
A mention of his mother?

199
00:28:30,368 --> 00:28:34,871
Right now, it might reawaken
distant episodes, memories.

200
00:28:34,956 --> 00:28:36,998
- Exactly.
- Exactly?

201
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,375
No.

202
00:28:38,501 --> 00:28:43,588
And what about facing unfulfilled
fantasies and desires?

203
00:28:43,631 --> 00:28:45,257
- No.
- No.

204
00:28:45,341 --> 00:28:47,843
Something regarding his childhood?

205
00:28:47,885 --> 00:28:50,011
With great discretion.

206
00:28:50,138 --> 00:28:52,139
With great discretion, fine.

207
00:28:52,223 --> 00:28:55,767
- Dreams, yes, though.
- It depends on the dreams.

208
00:28:55,893 --> 00:29:00,272
- However, no... it's best not to.
- Best not to...

209
00:29:00,356 --> 00:29:02,607
Perfect, thank you.

210
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,276
Perfect.

211
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,403
Change of program!

212
00:29:06,529 --> 00:29:12,409
We'll start with
all that's happened recently.

213
00:29:12,493 --> 00:29:15,495
I just can't go on.

214
00:29:15,538 --> 00:29:18,915
Have you ever felt like this before?

215
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:22,043
I don't know.

216
00:29:22,128 --> 00:29:24,796
I don't think so, but I don't know.

217
00:29:32,513 --> 00:29:34,681
Listen...

218
00:29:36,017 --> 00:29:39,186
- Any problems with your faith?
- No.

219
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,688
- You're sure?
- Yes.

220
00:29:41,773 --> 00:29:44,316
God sees abilities in me
I don't have.

221
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,069
Where are these abilities?

222
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:50,781
I look for them and find nothing.

223
00:29:50,823 --> 00:29:54,701
You've been chosen,
let's say, by God...

224
00:29:54,786 --> 00:29:57,412
for your qualities...

225
00:29:57,455 --> 00:29:59,039
for your goodness.

226
00:29:59,081 --> 00:30:02,042
So how can you possibly suddenly...

227
00:30:02,084 --> 00:30:04,961
Was the doctor asked
if he's a believer?

228
00:30:05,046 --> 00:30:06,797
No one asked.

229
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:08,840
- Are you?
- No, I'm not.

230
00:30:08,925 --> 00:30:12,093
- Not good.
- But I'm afraid that's how it is.

231
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,554
Anyway, let's go on.

232
00:30:14,597 --> 00:30:20,352
Excuse me, you can stay
it's fine, but in silence please!

233
00:30:20,478 --> 00:30:22,687
Your spokesman...

234
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:28,068
Your spokesman told me
that while they all waited for you...

235
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:31,863
- to go onto the balcony...
- Know what happened to me?

236
00:30:31,989 --> 00:30:37,244
- As they were coming towards me, some singing...
- Yes.

237
00:30:37,328 --> 00:30:40,121
Some crying...

238
00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:43,083
We were all very emotional.

239
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:48,129
Little by little,
they began disappearing.

240
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:50,507
They began disappearing?

241
00:30:50,591 --> 00:30:52,634
No...

242
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:56,888
all the people I once knew
were suddenly gone.

243
00:30:56,973 --> 00:30:59,015
Everything vanished.

244
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,268
I can't remember anything.

245
00:31:10,278 --> 00:31:14,030
- Do you want to be Pope?
- I'm already Pope.

246
00:31:15,366 --> 00:31:17,659
It was decided by the cardinals.

247
00:31:18,619 --> 00:31:20,745
It was decided by God.

248
00:31:22,665 --> 00:31:25,625
Was this meeting of ours useful?

249
00:31:25,668 --> 00:31:26,793
I don't know.

250
00:31:26,878 --> 00:31:30,547
You see, Pope,
with all these people around...

251
00:31:30,673 --> 00:31:33,300
looking at me...

252
00:31:33,384 --> 00:31:35,677
checking me, I just can't work.

253
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:40,181
Maybe a colleague
who doesn't know he's the Pope...

254
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:45,020
could meet him away from here.

255
00:31:45,062 --> 00:31:48,815
We must do something right away.

256
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:50,942
That's why we came to you.

257
00:31:51,068 --> 00:31:54,321
- Because you're the best.
- A curse!

258
00:31:54,447 --> 00:31:56,823
Everyone always says:

259
00:31:56,949 --> 00:31:58,199
"You're the best".

260
00:31:58,326 --> 00:32:02,537
My wife, also a psychoanalyst,
always said:

261
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,081
"Darling, you're the best".

262
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:09,461
But she left me,
she couldn't stand the comparison.

263
00:32:09,587 --> 00:32:12,172
- Is your wife good?
- The best after me.

264
00:32:12,214 --> 00:32:16,676
She's prepared, sensitive...

265
00:32:16,719 --> 00:32:21,681
but she's obsessed
with parental deficit. - Interesting.

266
00:32:21,724 --> 00:32:24,476
She tells everyone,
really everyone...

267
00:32:24,602 --> 00:32:29,105
when we all were small children,
infants...

268
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,691
when we were just a few...

269
00:32:31,734 --> 00:32:36,821
when we were just a few months old,
something happened...

270
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:41,242
that we have to deal with
for the rest of our lives.

271
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:45,872
So the fear of being abandoned...

272
00:32:45,957 --> 00:32:50,627
and the fear that something
might happen to us...

273
00:32:50,753 --> 00:32:53,213
- Where are we?
- It's your room.

274
00:32:53,255 --> 00:32:58,093
- My room?
- I'm here if you need anything.

275
00:32:58,135 --> 00:33:00,595
You'll be quite comfortable.

276
00:33:00,638 --> 00:33:04,015
Now I see!

277
00:33:04,141 --> 00:33:08,395
Don't worry, we're sworn to secrecy.

278
00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:10,772
You don't think I'd go around...

279
00:33:10,856 --> 00:33:15,402
If you'd like to phone home.

280
00:33:15,486 --> 00:33:19,155
I'll stay here, listen,
and then I'll take your phone.

281
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,409
No, my kids are in school now.
I have to call them this evening.

282
00:33:22,493 --> 00:33:24,119
Talk to them!

283
00:33:24,161 --> 00:33:30,125
- Why take my phone?
- It's forbidden to communicate with the outside.

284
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:32,127
I'm sorry.

285
00:33:33,921 --> 00:33:38,883
Meet with the cardinals,
those you're closest to...

286
00:33:38,926 --> 00:33:42,887
and start thinking of
a new Secretary of State...

287
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:46,182
or perhaps reconfirm
the previous one.

288
00:33:46,267 --> 00:33:49,394
Or, if you're up to it...

289
00:33:49,437 --> 00:33:53,523
you could go out on the balcony...

290
00:33:53,566 --> 00:33:57,444
to say hello to the faithful,
or just give a blessing.

291
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:02,949
I didn't follow a word you said.

292
00:34:05,036 --> 00:34:06,786
Help me.

293
00:34:08,456 --> 00:34:10,832
I can't do this!

294
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:17,338
Rajski, what's
the reaction of the faithful?

295
00:34:17,423 --> 00:34:21,551
How are they taking this uncertainty,
what do they know.

296
00:34:21,594 --> 00:34:27,307
No one knows anything, but we
can't keep it secret much longer.

297
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:32,479
All together we can convince
His Holiness to go out on the balcony.

298
00:34:32,605 --> 00:34:36,566
Locked up in here,
maybe you don't realize.

299
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:39,194
This is a very big deal!

300
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:45,825
Don't do that.

301
00:34:45,868 --> 00:34:48,995
That attitude doesn't help.

302
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,582
You see, we don't know what to do.

303
00:34:52,625 --> 00:34:56,878
No one ever thought
anything like this could happen.

304
00:35:11,769 --> 00:35:14,020
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

305
00:35:19,777 --> 00:35:21,778
Good evening.

306
00:35:42,925 --> 00:35:44,926
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

307
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,764
Come in.

308
00:35:49,807 --> 00:35:51,182
Good evening.

309
00:35:51,267 --> 00:35:53,309
Good evening, how are you?

310
00:35:53,435 --> 00:35:55,186
Fine.

311
00:35:55,271 --> 00:35:57,564
- Good night.
- Good night.

312
00:36:08,284 --> 00:36:10,702
We can't do this!

313
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:15,582
Mom, help!

314
00:36:16,834 --> 00:36:19,711
Mommy, help!

315
00:36:20,462 --> 00:36:22,672
No!

316
00:36:47,823 --> 00:36:51,743
No! Why?

317
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:06,382
We can't do this!

318
00:37:07,384 --> 00:37:09,010
No!

319
00:37:12,765 --> 00:37:14,766
- Good night.
- Good night.

320
00:38:30,592 --> 00:38:35,221
Two are positioned
on the Bingo Hall on this square...

321
00:38:35,306 --> 00:38:38,975
another three
on the roof of the Eden Theater.

322
00:38:39,101 --> 00:38:42,186
If we go through Piazza Adriana...

323
00:38:42,229 --> 00:38:47,442
one of you substitutes
the newsagent...

324
00:38:47,484 --> 00:38:49,986
two dress as traffic cops...

325
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:54,115
and we'll put another eight
on the Castel Sant'Angelo walkway.

326
00:38:54,992 --> 00:38:59,620
For security reasons, the route
will be decided at the last minute.

327
00:38:59,705 --> 00:39:01,956
I remind you that the cardinals...

328
00:39:01,999 --> 00:39:06,502
We'd rather the cardinals know
nothing about this operation.

329
00:39:06,587 --> 00:39:09,505
However, we'll be back
within a couple of hours...

330
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:12,967
and all this
will never have happened.

331
00:39:14,386 --> 00:39:16,387
Hello, how's it going?

332
00:39:17,264 --> 00:39:20,224
Rajski, I wrote it all here.

333
00:39:20,267 --> 00:39:24,854
The first eleven patients
must be contacted immediately...

334
00:39:24,897 --> 00:39:27,982
we had appointments
for today or tomorrow.

335
00:39:28,025 --> 00:39:31,152
- Please, tell them gently.
- Don't worry.

336
00:39:31,278 --> 00:39:34,280
I haven't missed a day in six years.

337
00:39:34,406 --> 00:39:38,910
Tell them I'm sick
and it will take...

338
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:44,540
How long will I be sick?

339
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:21,828
That never opened again...

340
00:40:21,954 --> 00:40:24,330
leaving the world holding its breath.

341
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:31,045
The faithful sang and prayed
in the square all night...

342
00:40:31,088 --> 00:40:33,923
I saw someone moving
behind the drapes.

343
00:40:33,966 --> 00:40:35,716
I'm sure it was two cardinals.

344
00:40:35,843 --> 00:40:38,469
I feel something will soon happen.

345
00:40:38,554 --> 00:40:40,346
You just heard a nun talking.

346
00:40:40,431 --> 00:40:45,601
These rumors still haven't
been denied by the Holy See.

347
00:40:46,603 --> 00:40:51,941
Meantime we're receiving statements
from Heads of State worldwide.

348
00:40:51,984 --> 00:40:55,069
"We feel great anxiety",
said Sarkozy.

349
00:40:55,112 --> 00:40:58,990
"But the entire Catholic world trusts
the Vatican to find a rapid solution".

350
00:40:59,074 --> 00:41:03,369
- It's shameful.
- The President of Brazil is flying to Italy...

351
00:41:03,454 --> 00:41:07,248
to be close to the Holy See.

352
00:41:30,898 --> 00:41:33,232
Second floor, apartment 3.

353
00:41:37,029 --> 00:41:39,780
So, you've always lived alone?

354
00:41:40,782 --> 00:41:44,911
- Why do you ask?
- It will help me get to know you.

355
00:41:44,995 --> 00:41:48,789
You say you're not married,
you have no children.

356
00:41:48,874 --> 00:41:52,293
- Any important ties of affection?
- No.

357
00:41:53,795 --> 00:41:55,671
Has this been a problem for you?

358
00:41:56,924 --> 00:42:00,510
I don't know,
that's how my life has been.

359
00:42:02,804 --> 00:42:07,141
I can't do anything anymore,
I'm always tired.

360
00:42:07,184 --> 00:42:09,685
Have you talked to anyone
about this difficulty?

361
00:42:09,811 --> 00:42:11,771
No one.

362
00:42:11,813 --> 00:42:14,815
But everyone knows by now.

363
00:42:14,942 --> 00:42:16,651
I can't do this.

364
00:42:18,779 --> 00:42:21,405
But the others
have great trust in me.

365
00:42:21,448 --> 00:42:25,576
- The others?
- I'd like to do so much.

366
00:42:27,204 --> 00:42:29,455
So many things need to be changed.

367
00:42:29,581 --> 00:42:32,083
I'd like...

368
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:37,547
- So, you work.
- Yes, but... no.

369
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:39,048
What do you do?

370
00:42:40,092 --> 00:42:42,093
- What do I do?
- Yes.

371
00:42:48,308 --> 00:42:51,102
- I'm an actor.
- An actor!

372
00:42:51,228 --> 00:42:53,229
Nice!

373
00:42:53,355 --> 00:42:55,481
- But an actor...
- Theater.

374
00:42:56,066 --> 00:42:59,318
I've always loved it.

375
00:43:00,571 --> 00:43:02,488
The tours...

376
00:43:02,614 --> 00:43:05,741
traveling from one city to another...

377
00:43:05,867 --> 00:43:07,451
the rehearsals...

378
00:43:07,494 --> 00:43:12,248
the opening nights,
when you read the reviews together.

379
00:43:12,958 --> 00:43:14,625
Nice.

380
00:43:15,586 --> 00:43:18,254
But now I'm tired.

381
00:43:22,259 --> 00:43:24,510
How did it go?

382
00:43:27,139 --> 00:43:31,267
I think it will take
three sessions a week.

383
00:43:31,351 --> 00:43:36,355
- For how many weeks?
- I'd say a couple of years.

384
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,650
That's a lot.

385
00:43:40,652 --> 00:43:42,486
I know.

386
00:43:44,906 --> 00:43:47,241
I need to walk a little.

387
00:44:30,077 --> 00:44:32,411
No! No!

388
00:44:53,225 --> 00:44:55,726
A sustained heaviness.

389
00:44:55,811 --> 00:44:58,854
My head's too full,
but I don't know what of.

390
00:45:00,357 --> 00:45:05,486
It's like a kind of
psychological sinusitis.

391
00:45:06,738 --> 00:45:09,990
Is this what you call depression?

392
00:45:10,075 --> 00:45:12,993
It happened to me so suddenly.

393
00:45:13,078 --> 00:45:14,995
Faster!

394
00:45:17,874 --> 00:45:19,959
What have we done...

395
00:45:22,629 --> 00:45:24,755
What have you done!

396
00:45:31,346 --> 00:45:35,141
Perhaps you suffered
because your mother...

397
00:45:35,225 --> 00:45:38,644
when you were a small child...

398
00:45:38,729 --> 00:45:41,605
paid more attention to someone else.

399
00:45:41,648 --> 00:45:44,150
You know what we call that?

400
00:45:44,234 --> 00:45:45,901
Parental deficit.

401
00:45:46,027 --> 00:45:48,237
- What?
- What should I remember.

402
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,030
Yes.

403
00:46:34,951 --> 00:46:37,661
What should I remember?

404
00:46:37,704 --> 00:46:41,081
My first three months,
my first three years...

405
00:46:42,292 --> 00:46:44,293
I don't remember a thing.

406
00:46:44,336 --> 00:46:44,836
Sir!

407
00:46:51,468 --> 00:46:53,677
Are you sick?

408
00:46:56,306 --> 00:46:58,182
Do you need help?

409
00:47:01,728 --> 00:47:04,730
- A little water?
- Yes.

410
00:47:11,071 --> 00:47:13,739
How are you feeling? Any better.

411
00:47:13,824 --> 00:47:16,367
Better, thank you.

412
00:47:16,493 --> 00:47:19,245
If you wait, I'm through in an hour.

413
00:47:19,371 --> 00:47:22,998
- I'll take you to a bus stop.
- There's no need, really,

414
00:47:23,083 --> 00:47:25,626
I'm fine now.

415
00:47:25,752 --> 00:47:30,339
- You're still very pale.
- I said I'm fine now!

416
00:47:30,382 --> 00:47:33,133
Didn't you hear me?

417
00:47:33,218 --> 00:47:36,345
- If you want...
- Stop, I'm fine, I told you!

418
00:48:39,701 --> 00:48:41,702
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

419
00:48:41,786 --> 00:48:44,830
- Excuse me, do you have...
- The bathroom's out of order.

420
00:48:47,542 --> 00:48:48,959
Pardon me.

421
00:48:51,463 --> 00:48:55,466
- May I make a phone call?
- The phone's only for work.

422
00:49:00,555 --> 00:49:02,306
Sir?

423
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:06,602
- You can use mine.
- Very kind of you.

424
00:49:07,604 --> 00:49:12,358
- Thank you.
- It's a short call.

425
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:30,751
- Hello?
- I'm Melville.

426
00:49:30,877 --> 00:49:33,587
Holiness! How are you?

427
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:36,507
Tell me where you are,
we'll come immediately.

428
00:49:36,633 --> 00:49:38,884
- No.
- Where are you?

429
00:49:38,969 --> 00:49:41,470
I don't know.

430
00:49:42,138 --> 00:49:45,641
- Are you all right?
- I feel better.

431
00:49:45,725 --> 00:49:49,520
- We're worried about you, you should come back!
- Be patient.

432
00:49:49,604 --> 00:49:51,772
I need time.

433
00:49:51,898 --> 00:49:55,651
I have to remember
a lot of things about my life...

434
00:49:55,735 --> 00:49:58,362
- things I've forgotten.
- Please...

435
00:49:58,405 --> 00:50:03,158
Do it for me, I made such a fuck...
an unforgivable mistake!

436
00:50:03,284 --> 00:50:06,286
Help me please, come back.

437
00:50:06,413 --> 00:50:08,872
Not now.

438
00:50:08,915 --> 00:50:11,041
I'll call you soon.

439
00:50:12,794 --> 00:50:16,046
- I'm not sure I can do it...
- Don't worry.

440
00:50:16,172 --> 00:50:20,050
It's very simple but rather important.

441
00:50:20,176 --> 00:50:23,554
Stop here please.

442
00:50:26,933 --> 00:50:28,809
Here.

443
00:50:28,935 --> 00:50:32,563
Move these drapes
in the morning, very early...

444
00:50:34,441 --> 00:50:39,570
so they'll all see
the Holy Father is in his apartments.

445
00:50:39,696 --> 00:50:43,198
Do it a couple of times a day...

446
00:50:43,283 --> 00:50:45,909
and once before going to bed.

447
00:50:45,952 --> 00:50:49,329
But be careful,
all they must see is a shadow.

448
00:50:49,414 --> 00:50:51,582
Remove your beret, of course.

449
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:54,835
- Can I turn on the TV?
- Yes, occasionally.

450
00:50:54,961 --> 00:51:00,716
Remove your doublet too.
I'll have them bring you something white.

451
00:51:01,718 --> 00:51:03,552
Good night.

452
00:51:15,356 --> 00:51:19,693
"For my days vanish like smoke..."

453
00:51:19,736 --> 00:51:23,614
".. my bones burn like glowing embers."

454
00:51:23,698 --> 00:51:26,742
"Hear how these Bible passages..."

455
00:51:26,868 --> 00:51:31,455
"..seem to echo
the situation of the Holy Father."

456
00:51:31,498 --> 00:51:36,335
"My heart is blighted
and withered like grass."

457
00:51:36,377 --> 00:51:40,714
"I forget to eat my food."

458
00:51:47,263 --> 00:51:49,973
"Fear and trembling come upon me..."

459
00:51:50,016 --> 00:51:53,227
"..and anguish overwhelms me".

460
00:51:53,728 --> 00:51:59,024
In the Bible, the only book
you put in my room...

461
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:01,360
I might add...

462
00:52:01,402 --> 00:52:04,905
in the Bible,
it talks about depression.

463
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:08,492
Yes, but this cannot
concern the Holy Father.

464
00:52:08,535 --> 00:52:13,163
It is you, due to your temperament
and professional bias...

465
00:52:13,289 --> 00:52:14,998
who sees depression everywhere.

466
00:52:15,041 --> 00:52:20,295
But in this book
are all the symptoms of depression:

467
00:52:20,421 --> 00:52:24,800
Feelings of guilt, weight loss,
suicidal thoughts.

468
00:52:24,926 --> 00:52:26,802
"I feel better".

469
00:52:28,179 --> 00:52:33,809
The Holy Father just told me
these exact words:

470
00:52:33,935 --> 00:52:35,936
"I feel better".

471
00:52:36,062 --> 00:52:39,648
He had a good day, he prayed...

472
00:52:39,691 --> 00:52:43,527
he had something to eat
in his apartments...

473
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:46,697
and his mood seemed encouraging.

474
00:52:51,077 --> 00:52:54,204
You're pleased
the Holy Father feels better?

475
00:52:56,708 --> 00:52:59,585
- Australian cardinals, good evening.
- Good evening.

476
00:52:59,669 --> 00:53:03,088
- How's the jet lag?
- Much better, thank you.

477
00:53:03,173 --> 00:53:05,966
- What is it?
- "Living with the Etruscans".

478
00:53:06,092 --> 00:53:09,803
- Is it worth a visit?
- It's a beautiful outing.

479
00:53:09,846 --> 00:53:12,723
I've never been there
but it's beautiful.

480
00:53:12,849 --> 00:53:15,225
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

481
00:53:16,227 --> 00:53:19,104
Everything we need is
here in the Vatican, right?

482
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:24,735
The famous service station
where gas costs less...

483
00:53:24,819 --> 00:53:26,737
shops...

484
00:53:26,863 --> 00:53:28,739
Gym facilities.

485
00:53:28,823 --> 00:53:32,868
- Gym facilities?
- Sure. - Just great.

486
00:53:32,994 --> 00:53:39,374
The pharmacy with medicines
you can't find in Rome.

487
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,376
Well, well...

488
00:54:10,156 --> 00:54:15,285
We who are fortunate
to think we understand things...

489
00:54:17,664 --> 00:54:23,043
but recently it's been hard for
the Church to understand things.

490
00:54:28,049 --> 00:54:31,176
The beginning of Peter's mission...

491
00:54:31,302 --> 00:54:33,679
in the history of salvation...

492
00:54:35,014 --> 00:54:38,308
in the history of God's people...

493
00:54:38,434 --> 00:54:41,395
Why?

494
00:54:41,437 --> 00:54:44,064
What's changed?

495
00:54:46,067 --> 00:54:48,652
I can't live without you.

496
00:54:52,573 --> 00:54:55,534
We've often been afraid...

497
00:54:57,453 --> 00:54:59,955
to admit our faults.

498
00:55:02,208 --> 00:55:05,043
Yes, I'm talking to myself.

499
00:55:07,547 --> 00:55:10,966
I'm looking for the words
for a speech I have to make...

500
00:55:11,092 --> 00:55:15,053
before a crowd of people.

501
00:55:15,096 --> 00:55:17,431
I'm a little worried.

502
00:55:23,229 --> 00:55:28,567
If I take my usual sleeping pill
before bedtime...

503
00:55:28,609 --> 00:55:31,945
when I wake up at 3,
I take this other one?

504
00:55:31,988 --> 00:55:38,327
- No! - Why?
- These medicines don't go together.

505
00:55:38,703 --> 00:55:40,495
Sleeping pills.

506
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:44,124
This is the family of tranquilizers.

507
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:47,586
These are mood stabilizers...

508
00:55:49,505 --> 00:55:53,508
This is a major tranquilizer.
This is strong!

509
00:55:53,593 --> 00:55:55,260
Who takes this?

510
00:55:57,263 --> 00:56:00,098
- Who takes this?
- I don't know.

511
00:56:07,648 --> 00:56:11,651
Anyway, if you take a sleeping pill...

512
00:56:11,736 --> 00:56:15,155
it should have a short half-life.

513
00:56:15,281 --> 00:56:20,118
O'Neill, let's say you wake up
tomorrow wanting to do sports.

514
00:56:20,161 --> 00:56:22,913
- I don't do sports!
- Follow me on this.

515
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:28,502
If you do sports tomorrow,
you'll still be fuzzy from this...

516
00:56:28,544 --> 00:56:31,797
- Good evening to all.
- How is he?

517
00:56:31,881 --> 00:56:35,550
Better, his appetite's back.
His Holiness ate everything.

518
00:56:35,635 --> 00:56:40,680
Two types of prosciutto,
all the vegetables.

519
00:56:40,765 --> 00:56:43,141
He devoured the fruit...

520
00:56:43,184 --> 00:56:46,061
and even had a small dessert.

521
00:56:46,187 --> 00:56:50,899
Now he's resting in his apartments.

522
00:57:25,059 --> 00:57:26,977
Like it?

523
00:57:27,103 --> 00:57:29,688
I have a parental deficit.

524
00:57:32,984 --> 00:57:34,860
But I don't know what it is.

525
00:57:48,458 --> 00:57:50,375
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

526
00:57:51,252 --> 00:57:55,589
Excuse me, could I have a room?

527
00:57:55,631 --> 00:57:58,633
- How many nights?
- I don't know.

528
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,972
- For tonight?
- Yes. Special rates?

529
00:58:04,015 --> 00:58:05,765
No.

530
00:58:12,273 --> 00:58:14,649
- Poor man.
- Why?

531
00:58:14,734 --> 00:58:16,776
They say he's dead.

532
00:58:16,861 --> 00:58:19,779
Now they'll elect another,
but without letting on.

533
00:58:21,282 --> 00:58:24,868
- They said it on TV?
- They can't...

534
00:58:24,911 --> 00:58:26,411
but it's obvious.

535
00:58:31,292 --> 00:58:35,170
The Holy Father
is in his rooms, in prayer.

536
00:58:35,254 --> 00:58:37,005
But the moment
we've been waiting for...

537
00:58:44,764 --> 00:58:48,558
Nuntio vobis gaudium magnum...

538
00:59:23,052 --> 00:59:25,095
The Pope!

539
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:28,181
Brummer!

540
00:59:33,229 --> 00:59:35,313
The Pope!

541
00:59:35,815 --> 00:59:38,441
What is happening?

542
00:59:38,484 --> 00:59:42,320
- The Pope!
- He feels better.

543
01:00:26,157 --> 01:00:29,534
Nina, coming from backstage:
"It's clear we can't continue".

544
01:00:29,619 --> 01:00:31,786
"I can leave, goodbye."

545
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:35,540
She kisses Arkadina
and Polina Andryevna...

546
01:00:37,376 --> 01:00:40,670
- Please, excuse us.
- "May I introduce Boris Alexeyevich."

547
01:00:40,796 --> 01:00:45,759
Nina, confounded:
"A great joy, I've read your books."

548
01:00:45,801 --> 01:00:48,678
Arkadina, sitting Nina beside her:

549
01:00:48,804 --> 01:00:52,182
"Don't be confounded, dear,
he's a celebrity."

550
01:00:52,266 --> 01:00:56,311
"But he's a simple man,
and is himself confounded."

551
01:00:56,437 --> 01:00:58,563
Dorn, irritated:

552
01:00:58,648 --> 01:01:00,940
"Jakov, my brother, raise the curtain."

553
01:01:01,067 --> 01:01:06,029
"When I was young I wanted to be
a scholar, but didn't become one!"

554
01:01:06,072 --> 01:01:10,075
"I wanted to be an orator, but my
speaking would make you nauseous!"

555
01:01:10,201 --> 01:01:13,536
"I wanted to marry but didn't!"

556
01:01:13,579 --> 01:01:15,038
"I wanted to live in the city."

557
01:01:15,081 --> 01:01:17,957
"I wanted to live in the city..."

558
01:01:18,084 --> 01:01:21,961
".. but I end my life living
in the country. And that's it."

559
01:01:23,547 --> 01:01:28,593
"To express dissatisfaction
with life at sixty-two, is petty."

560
01:01:28,678 --> 01:01:30,553
"How obstinate!"

561
01:01:30,596 --> 01:01:34,349
- "Can't you see I want to live?"
- "That's frivolity."

562
01:01:34,475 --> 01:01:38,353
"The laws of Nature dictate
that every life must end."

563
01:01:38,437 --> 01:01:42,232
"You reason as a satiated man.
You are satiated..."

564
01:01:42,358 --> 01:01:44,984
"..so you're uninterested in life."

565
01:01:45,111 --> 01:01:47,862
Medvedenko: "Let's go home, Masha!"

566
01:01:47,988 --> 01:01:50,990
- "Let's go home, Masha."
- Masha:"Go by yourself."

567
01:01:51,075 --> 01:01:55,120
- "Go by yourself".
- Medvedenco: Your father won't give me horses."

568
01:01:55,246 --> 01:01:58,373
- "Your father won't give me horses."
- Stop, why repeat my lines?

569
01:01:58,499 --> 01:02:00,709
- My sister...
- You have no sister!

570
01:02:00,751 --> 01:02:04,629
- It's not true.
- My sister played Chekhov for many years.

571
01:02:04,755 --> 01:02:07,382
I know it by heart.

572
01:02:07,466 --> 01:02:09,509
- "The Seagull".
- Masha.

573
01:02:09,635 --> 01:02:11,845
Masha, confidently:

574
01:02:13,514 --> 01:02:15,890
"He will, ask him for them."

575
01:02:15,975 --> 01:02:18,143
"He will."

576
01:02:18,227 --> 01:02:21,521
"Father, will you let
my husband have a horse?"

577
01:02:21,647 --> 01:02:24,274
Shamrayev: "Not possible!"

578
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,151
Not possible!

579
01:02:26,277 --> 01:02:29,863
Medvedenco: "I'll walk home."

580
01:02:30,865 --> 01:02:33,408
And at last, he exits.

581
01:02:34,285 --> 01:02:36,411
We'll see you soon.

582
01:05:16,906 --> 01:05:21,576
You had three points,
plus one, is four.

583
01:05:21,702 --> 01:05:24,704
- We made just one point?
- Yes!

584
01:05:24,788 --> 01:05:27,957
You had to take 5 and 4 with 9!

585
01:05:28,083 --> 01:05:31,461
- With a 7 on the table?
- You don't know how to play.

586
01:05:31,545 --> 01:05:34,797
You should have left the 7
and called "spariglio".

587
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:38,176
- But we made a point.
- And they got two points...

588
01:05:38,218 --> 01:05:41,679
with the last trick.

589
01:05:41,722 --> 01:05:44,057
When it's not your hand,
you must call "spariglio".

590
01:05:44,099 --> 01:05:48,978
- You're always distracted!
- No, I'm focused.

591
01:05:49,104 --> 01:05:52,857
- No, it's no way to play!
- I'm very sorry.

592
01:05:52,942 --> 01:05:54,984
It's the second time we've lost.

593
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:58,613
- Whose deal is it?
- Excuse me, I can't take anymore.

594
01:05:58,697 --> 01:06:03,242
- You're offended?
- No, I have a headache.

595
01:06:03,369 --> 01:06:08,623
- Would you like to play?
- I don't know what they think.

596
01:06:08,707 --> 01:06:14,128
- Know what "spariglio" is?
- I've been told lots of times.

597
01:06:14,254 --> 01:06:19,008
I think I understand,
but I can't follow this technique.

598
01:06:19,134 --> 01:06:22,261
Let me play my own way.

599
01:06:24,014 --> 01:06:26,766
"Evgenij, which of us
looks younger?"

600
01:06:26,892 --> 01:06:29,769
- "You, of course."
- "You see! And why?"

601
01:06:29,853 --> 01:06:33,523
- "Because I work, I feel..."
- Because I work, I feel.

602
01:06:33,607 --> 01:06:38,236
You're always in the same place,
you don't live.

603
01:06:38,278 --> 01:06:42,156
"I have a rule:
Never look to the future."

604
01:06:42,282 --> 01:06:44,409
"I never think about old age or death."

605
01:06:44,535 --> 01:06:48,287
"I feel like I was born so long ago..."

606
01:06:48,372 --> 01:06:52,417
- "I drag my life like an endless train".
- Excuse me.

607
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:55,169
"Often I've no desire to live."

608
01:06:55,295 --> 01:06:58,548
Here Dorn should come in.

609
01:06:58,674 --> 01:07:03,636
- Did you visit Dario? How is he?
- The doctors say it's not serious.

610
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:08,182
- But he won't make the opening night.
- Pardon...

611
01:07:08,267 --> 01:07:10,685
That's it? Did you call Baldineti?

612
01:07:10,769 --> 01:07:15,690
Yes, but he's on tour,
Guerrini's not here or Zagoni...

613
01:07:15,774 --> 01:07:19,527
and not even that tall guy
with a moustache, De Biasio.

614
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:24,323
- What'll we do about Dorn?
- I can give the lines.

615
01:07:24,450 --> 01:07:29,954
I've given it some thought, I guess
I'll just have to do it myself.

616
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:35,334
- Oh, great.
- Just for the first few days!

617
01:07:36,837 --> 01:07:39,922
I really miss my wife.

618
01:07:39,965 --> 01:07:44,969
A period of being apart gives you
the chance to measure the value of love.

619
01:07:45,095 --> 01:07:49,557
- What do you know?
- No, guys, I miss her...

620
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:53,186
meaning, we're separated.

621
01:07:53,228 --> 01:07:56,481
She's a psychoanalyst too.

622
01:07:56,565 --> 01:08:02,236
She left me because I'm the best
and it bothered her.

623
01:08:02,321 --> 01:08:08,117
She's good too, but she's
obsessed with parental deficit.

624
01:08:08,202 --> 01:08:10,495
Interesting!

625
01:08:10,621 --> 01:08:13,372
But these are formulas.

626
01:08:13,457 --> 01:08:15,458
I could simplify and say...

627
01:08:15,501 --> 01:08:20,129
the Holy Father
feels vulnerable at the moment...

628
01:08:20,214 --> 01:08:24,008
but at the same time,
narcissistically exceptional!

629
01:08:24,093 --> 01:08:27,637
- How dare you?
- I mean the man...

630
01:08:27,763 --> 01:08:29,764
- not the Pope.
- They're the same thing!

631
01:08:29,848 --> 01:08:32,141
I'm not so sure... Queen.

632
01:08:32,226 --> 01:08:34,352
Does your wife have a new life?

633
01:08:34,394 --> 01:08:37,730
Yes, she's been with a guy
for a few years.

634
01:08:37,773 --> 01:08:42,985
He's a good person, but she can't
bring herself to tell our kids.

635
01:08:43,028 --> 01:08:45,530
He's a psychoanalyst too.

636
01:08:45,614 --> 01:08:48,282
All these psychoanalysts!
Is there such a need?

637
01:08:48,367 --> 01:08:52,036
But I have a good relationship
with my wife.

638
01:08:52,162 --> 01:08:55,414
- I'm glad. - Yes.
- I'm glad too.

639
01:08:55,499 --> 01:08:57,500
Point!

640
01:08:57,543 --> 01:09:01,170
I confused them with my chatter.

641
01:09:01,296 --> 01:09:06,300
Actually, the Conclave
is still technically operative.

642
01:09:06,385 --> 01:09:10,012
Yes, we all heard
the spokesman for the Holy See...

643
01:09:10,055 --> 01:09:15,685
but I don't think he reassured
the hundreds of millions of faithful.

644
01:09:15,811 --> 01:09:19,689
Might we say this is
an unexpected event?

645
01:09:19,773 --> 01:09:23,651
You know I used to eat here
with Salvo Randone?

646
01:09:23,694 --> 01:09:25,319
Do you know who he was?

647
01:09:25,445 --> 01:09:30,783
He's the one who, with Gassman,
would do Othello one evening...

648
01:09:30,826 --> 01:09:32,952
and lago the next, they'd swap parts.

649
01:09:33,036 --> 01:09:36,330
We need to be patient.

650
01:09:36,456 --> 01:09:40,918
Haven't you formed an opinion
about what might have happened?

651
01:09:40,961 --> 01:09:46,090
I don't think there's
a mystery behind all this.

652
01:09:46,216 --> 01:09:50,845
A search for serenity, in silence,
before approaching the waiting world...

653
01:09:50,971 --> 01:09:54,724
- is a Pontiff's prerogative.
- It's not nonsense:

654
01:09:54,850 --> 01:09:58,227
Wine and tobacco
deprive the personality.

655
01:09:58,312 --> 01:10:00,938
Loving without hope.

656
01:10:00,981 --> 01:10:03,107
Entire years waiting for something...

657
01:10:03,192 --> 01:10:08,487
Last night I went into the garden
to see if our old theater was still there.

658
01:10:08,614 --> 01:10:11,949
- And it was there.
- It's dark in the garden.

659
01:10:11,992 --> 01:10:15,745
They should tear down that theater.

660
01:10:15,829 --> 01:10:19,749
It is there, bare.

661
01:10:19,833 --> 01:10:22,501
After a good cigar or some vodka...

662
01:10:33,013 --> 01:10:37,516
Let's remember that the Pope
is the Lord's first servant.

663
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:43,731
- But he's also the last.
- The first, but also the last.

664
01:10:43,774 --> 01:10:45,900
So, the first and also the last.

665
01:10:45,984 --> 01:10:48,402
This leads us, as a consequence?

666
01:10:48,528 --> 01:10:53,115
As a consequence this leads us...

667
01:10:57,746 --> 01:11:00,665
- This leads us...
- This leads us?

668
01:11:01,667 --> 01:11:04,168
No, I'm improvising!

669
01:11:04,253 --> 01:11:07,171
The truth is I'm totally confused.

670
01:11:07,297 --> 01:11:11,133
I ask the viewers' forgiveness.

671
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:14,178
Forgiveness from all of you.

672
01:11:16,556 --> 01:11:18,683
- Sorry.
- No, no problem!

673
01:11:18,767 --> 01:11:21,560
I remind you, formally,
the Conclave still isn't over...

674
01:11:21,645 --> 01:11:25,022
- I know.
- The cardinals are still isolated...

675
01:11:25,065 --> 01:11:28,276
far from the glare of the media.

676
01:11:28,318 --> 01:11:32,822
Europe, I haven't decided
if you're in two or three teams.

677
01:11:32,948 --> 01:11:36,659
North America, Asia, South America...

678
01:11:36,702 --> 01:11:39,578
Oceania, Swiss Guards...

679
01:11:39,663 --> 01:11:45,543
No! The tournament's unbalanced
with the Swiss Guards!

680
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:51,173
- You like winning, right?
- Yes.

681
01:11:51,216 --> 01:11:55,469
You're right,
no team of Swiss Guards...

682
01:11:55,595 --> 01:11:59,223
but I can't remember your name,
Cardinal.- Pescardona.

683
01:11:59,349 --> 01:12:02,727
During the Conclave...

684
01:12:02,811 --> 01:12:06,814
the bookmakers,
especially the English...

685
01:12:06,857 --> 01:12:09,233
have odds for all of you.

686
01:12:09,318 --> 01:12:11,360
Let's see Pescardona...

687
01:12:11,486 --> 01:12:14,363
Pescardona, Pescar...

688
01:12:18,118 --> 01:12:22,204
- You were given 7 to 1!
- What's that? Good?

689
01:12:22,247 --> 01:12:24,498
It sure is!

690
01:12:24,624 --> 01:12:27,752
The Holy Father was given
just 90 to 1.

691
01:12:27,836 --> 01:12:30,463
- That's wonderful!
- You don't understand.

692
01:12:30,505 --> 01:12:32,506
I'll explain.

693
01:12:32,632 --> 01:12:38,012
If you'd bet 10 Euros on him,
you'd have won 900.

694
01:12:38,096 --> 01:12:43,142
- Not bad?
- Then there's Cruz 72.

695
01:12:43,226 --> 01:12:46,520
Gregori well, the favored.

696
01:12:46,605 --> 01:12:50,274
- Here he is! - Good evening.
- We were talking about you.

697
01:12:50,359 --> 01:12:52,401
You were given 3 to 1.

698
01:12:52,527 --> 01:12:55,988
Was he disappointed
not to be elected?

699
01:12:56,031 --> 01:12:57,990
No one here is disappointed.

700
01:12:58,033 --> 01:13:01,869
- Lucky you!
- Brummer, what were my odds?

701
01:13:01,912 --> 01:13:03,788
Brummer you say?

702
01:13:03,914 --> 01:13:05,664
Brummer...

703
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:06,874
Brummer.

704
01:13:08,794 --> 01:13:13,923
If you all agree,
I'll choose the teams' captains...

705
01:13:14,007 --> 01:13:16,133
from the bookmakers' favorites.

706
01:13:16,176 --> 01:13:19,387
The captains can be Aguilar...

707
01:13:19,429 --> 01:13:23,307
Aguilar, Cincotta, Stenton, Bikila...

708
01:13:23,392 --> 01:13:25,935
You didn't give my number!

709
01:13:26,019 --> 01:13:31,190
If I didn't, there's a reason!
What do you think?

710
01:13:33,819 --> 01:13:35,778
Your number's not here.

711
01:13:35,821 --> 01:13:38,322
Your number doesn't exist.

712
01:13:38,448 --> 01:13:41,700
Since you insist:
You were given no odds at all!

713
01:13:41,785 --> 01:13:45,913
You weren't considered!

714
01:13:45,956 --> 01:13:47,706
You insisted, happy now?

715
01:13:47,833 --> 01:13:50,459
- No.
- I'd say not!

716
01:13:50,585 --> 01:13:52,211
But you insisted!

717
01:13:53,839 --> 01:13:58,717
Flatten these corners, all the way.

718
01:13:58,844 --> 01:14:01,595
To the side...

719
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:06,100
it has to be flattened right
to the end or we'll get hurt.

720
01:14:06,226 --> 01:14:08,477
Go, like that... come back!

721
01:14:08,562 --> 01:14:10,688
There's a hollow here.

722
01:14:10,730 --> 01:14:13,482
Go back...

723
01:14:13,567 --> 01:14:17,987
Now this part here.

724
01:14:20,699 --> 01:14:25,369
You have to flatten it,
one, two, three times...

725
01:14:25,454 --> 01:14:32,251
if not, when we jump
we could get hurt.

726
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:44,346
Like that, overhand.

727
01:14:46,141 --> 01:14:48,392
Overhand.

728
01:14:49,978 --> 01:14:52,104
Next in line.

729
01:14:54,649 --> 01:14:56,025
Next.

730
01:14:56,610 --> 01:15:00,654
- The Korean way. - What's it like?
- Underhand with a spin.

731
01:15:06,786 --> 01:15:08,537
Okay, no spin there...

732
01:15:08,622 --> 01:15:14,168
In the first heat is: North America,
Asia, Europe A, Eastern Europe.

733
01:15:14,252 --> 01:15:18,672
Why can't we have
an all-Italian team?

734
01:15:18,798 --> 01:15:23,135
No, you Italians play
either on the Europe A team...

735
01:15:23,178 --> 01:15:25,429
or on the Europe B.

736
01:15:25,514 --> 01:15:31,310
Please, don't spoil the grid,
I worked on it all night.

737
01:15:31,394 --> 01:15:35,940
Or I'll leave and you can do
the tournament by yourselves!

738
01:15:36,066 --> 01:15:40,945
Why don't we play Prison Dodgeball?

739
01:15:42,072 --> 01:15:44,448
- What?
- Prison Dodgeball.

740
01:15:44,533 --> 01:15:47,034
- Prison Dodgeball?
- Yes.

741
01:15:47,077 --> 01:15:52,706
Cardinal, it hasn't been played
in 50 years!

742
01:15:52,791 --> 01:15:57,586
In the second heat is:
South America, Africa...

743
01:15:57,712 --> 01:16:02,841
- Europa B e Oceania.
- But there are just three of us!

744
01:16:02,926 --> 01:16:07,179
Oceania is just three? Too bad!

745
01:16:07,222 --> 01:16:10,975
That means
you get experience this time...

746
01:16:11,059 --> 01:16:16,355
then, if you're good to
the faithful in the coming years.

747
01:16:16,481 --> 01:16:18,607
There will be more of you at
the next Conclave, 4, 5, 6...

748
01:16:18,733 --> 01:16:22,736
Do you see why it's better
to do a round-robin tournament...

749
01:16:22,862 --> 01:16:25,990
and not a direct elimination?

750
01:16:26,074 --> 01:16:30,494
- Professor, we don't understand.
- I can tell.

751
01:16:30,579 --> 01:16:33,747
But it's okay, just don't get mad.

752
01:16:33,873 --> 01:16:35,374
I won't get mad.

753
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:41,005
And with more games we give the Holy
Father more time to get back on his feet.

754
01:16:41,089 --> 01:16:44,633
Never underestimate the support...

755
01:16:44,718 --> 01:16:49,847
he receives in feeling
surrounded by this energy...

756
01:16:49,889 --> 01:16:52,266
this fighting spirit.

757
01:16:52,350 --> 01:17:00,149
I'd even tend towards
a double round-robin tournament.

758
01:17:00,275 --> 01:17:02,776
Double round-robin, no!

759
01:17:02,902 --> 01:17:04,528
We'd die!

760
01:17:05,864 --> 01:17:07,990
Come on, Giulio!

761
01:17:08,533 --> 01:17:10,284
It's true!

762
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:13,287
Mommy knows him, it's okay.

763
01:17:14,372 --> 01:17:18,167
I thought about it, it's true,
I've never really felt well.

764
01:17:19,419 --> 01:17:23,797
But I've done many things in my life.

765
01:17:24,924 --> 01:17:26,925
- Yes.
- I've even done some good.

766
01:17:29,638 --> 01:17:33,390
Why can't I do anything anymore?

767
01:17:33,433 --> 01:17:37,811
Can we talk later?
I'm taking the kids to school.

768
01:17:38,938 --> 01:17:41,565
Talk to you later.

769
01:17:43,026 --> 01:17:45,069
Yes, me too.

770
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:48,322
Was that your boyfriend?

771
01:17:49,532 --> 01:17:53,077
No way!
It was Leonardo, my colleague.

772
01:17:53,161 --> 01:17:57,331
- Giulio told me you have a boyfriend.
- Not true, I didn't tell you anything.

773
01:17:57,457 --> 01:17:59,416
You're an idiot!

774
01:17:59,459 --> 01:18:02,461
- You say it every night, I can't stand it!
- Mouth!

775
01:18:02,545 --> 01:18:05,464
Your classmates say so too:
You're a big mouth!

776
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:08,300
- You're stupid!
- Stop it!

777
01:18:08,343 --> 01:18:10,803
Or I'll drop you right here!

778
01:18:10,845 --> 01:18:12,096
You're a stinky girl!

779
01:18:15,433 --> 01:18:17,476
Bird-brain!

780
01:18:17,602 --> 01:18:19,853
That's enough!

781
01:18:19,938 --> 01:18:23,607
- Creep! - But he...
- Enough.

782
01:18:23,692 --> 01:18:26,193
I want no more.

783
01:18:28,321 --> 01:18:32,616
- Did you hit girls when you were little?
- Sure.

784
01:18:32,742 --> 01:18:35,119
See?

785
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:44,002
This black dragon,
with trees covered in lava.

786
01:18:44,087 --> 01:18:47,881
Here's the two-headed dragon phase...

787
01:18:47,966 --> 01:18:50,759
like he was divided.

788
01:18:50,885 --> 01:18:54,388
The two volcanoes:
One good and one bad.

789
01:18:55,098 --> 01:19:00,144
- This is him in the dragon's jaws.
- That's nice!

790
01:19:00,270 --> 01:19:02,896
- It's monstrous!
- No, look.

791
01:19:03,022 --> 01:19:07,484
Do you think he knows
Carlo and I have problems?

792
01:19:07,527 --> 01:19:11,155
What do you think,
should I leave my husband?

793
01:19:11,239 --> 01:19:13,490
Please, pay no attention to me.

794
01:19:13,533 --> 01:19:17,786
I'm not sitting here,
I'm in my apartments.

795
01:19:17,912 --> 01:19:19,913
Yes.

796
01:19:20,665 --> 01:19:24,543
- It's not true I'm an actor.
- No?

797
01:19:24,669 --> 01:19:29,423
I wanted to be, but I didn't
make it into the Academy.

798
01:19:30,925 --> 01:19:34,803
- I failed the audition.
- I'm sorry. - Thank you.

799
01:19:35,930 --> 01:19:39,558
They were right, I was no good.

800
01:19:40,685 --> 01:19:43,937
But they took my sister.

801
01:19:46,816 --> 01:19:51,028
See, very strong,
he gets four points.

802
01:19:51,070 --> 01:19:53,822
That was a wide-angle shot.

803
01:19:53,907 --> 01:19:57,201
He's trying to shoot...

804
01:19:57,827 --> 01:20:00,537
Point for South America!

805
01:20:02,081 --> 01:20:05,584
Point for Europe B!

806
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:17,095
We're not the casual,
senseless product of evolution.

807
01:20:17,222 --> 01:20:23,727
- Point for Africa!
- We're each the fruit of a thought of God.

808
01:20:23,853 --> 01:20:25,687
No, Gregori.

809
01:20:25,730 --> 01:20:31,360
That's the terrible
beauty of Darwinism.

810
01:20:31,444 --> 01:20:35,113
Terrible: No sense in life.

811
01:20:35,198 --> 01:20:37,616
No consolation.

812
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:41,203
Point for Europe B.
Europe B 10...

813
01:20:41,246 --> 01:20:43,205
Oceania 0.

814
01:20:43,248 --> 01:20:47,709
This other one is more exciting
because it's more competitive.

815
01:20:47,752 --> 01:20:49,878
South America to serve.

816
01:20:50,004 --> 01:20:54,007
Africa - South America: 8 - 6.

817
01:20:56,970 --> 01:20:58,971
Oceania 0...

818
01:20:59,013 --> 01:21:01,139
Europe B 11.

819
01:21:02,016 --> 01:21:04,268
Point for South America!

820
01:21:05,478 --> 01:21:07,771
South America to serve.

821
01:21:12,861 --> 01:21:15,279
Point for Europe B. Oceania!

822
01:21:23,246 --> 01:21:25,414
The Holy Father!

823
01:21:46,436 --> 01:21:50,939
Too bad, it was such
an interesting case for me!

824
01:21:53,568 --> 01:21:57,321
But now I know who he is,
I can't do anything for him.

825
01:21:58,948 --> 01:22:00,908
Who knows how he feels?

826
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:05,829
Let's get back to it!

827
01:22:06,789 --> 01:22:10,083
Europe B and
South America to serve.

828
01:22:59,384 --> 01:23:01,510
Point for Africa!

829
01:23:41,050 --> 01:23:43,552
Ball!

830
01:23:44,429 --> 01:23:45,929
Serve!

831
01:23:48,558 --> 01:23:51,018
Change!

832
01:23:52,770 --> 01:23:54,688
- Change!
- Change.

833
01:23:54,814 --> 01:23:57,691
Ribeck, Schindler, you seem tired.

834
01:23:57,775 --> 01:24:00,902
Scipioni and Bollati, you're in!

835
01:24:00,945 --> 01:24:03,530
- Me? No...
- Yes.

836
01:24:03,573 --> 01:24:05,073
I don't feel like it.

837
01:24:06,909 --> 01:24:08,577
Cardinal Cruz, again!

838
01:24:08,703 --> 01:24:10,328
Time out!

839
01:24:10,455 --> 01:24:13,832
I've told you when you are there...

840
01:24:13,916 --> 01:24:17,335
raise your hands!

841
01:24:19,088 --> 01:24:21,923
- I can't do it.
- Of course you can!

842
01:24:21,966 --> 01:24:24,843
Serve.

843
01:24:24,927 --> 01:24:29,431
- Europe B and Africa to serve.
- We can win!

844
01:24:30,558 --> 01:24:32,059
Concentrate.

845
01:24:32,101 --> 01:24:36,354
- Anyway you're lucky, you won't go to Hell.
- Good news.

846
01:24:36,439 --> 01:24:38,565
Point for South America!

847
01:24:38,608 --> 01:24:41,735
No one will, Hell is deserted.

848
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:46,615
Point.

849
01:24:49,243 --> 01:24:51,995
A comeback! A comeback!

850
01:24:52,371 --> 01:24:54,623
Point for Oceania!

851
01:24:54,707 --> 01:24:58,460
Europe B: 16. Oceania: 1.

852
01:26:08,948 --> 01:26:12,075
Let us welcome the word
that God gives us today.

853
01:26:12,201 --> 01:26:16,079
His words are for those of us...

854
01:26:16,205 --> 01:26:21,585
who carry in our hearts
desires, dreams, plans...

855
01:26:21,711 --> 01:26:23,920
but also worries...

856
01:26:23,963 --> 01:26:25,672
problems and fears...

857
01:26:25,715 --> 01:26:31,720
of all the things, maybe
what frightens us are these new times...

858
01:26:31,846 --> 01:26:35,599
the unprecedented situation,
the waiting...

859
01:26:35,725 --> 01:26:38,977
the length of which is unknown...

860
01:26:39,061 --> 01:26:42,981
but which asks us for a new heart...

861
01:26:43,065 --> 01:26:46,860
a new answer which God himself
suggests in these words:

862
01:26:46,986 --> 01:26:53,200
Humility, the wisdom
to recognize that we need God.

863
01:26:53,993 --> 01:26:57,871
We need His forgiveness,
His patience.

864
01:26:57,997 --> 01:27:01,875
We need to show our wounds to Him...

865
01:27:02,001 --> 01:27:04,753
because He is the only one
who can heal them.

866
01:27:17,266 --> 01:27:21,019
Holy Father,
we're behind in everything.

867
01:27:21,145 --> 01:27:25,899
You haven't yet indicated
the start of the new Pontificate.

868
01:27:25,983 --> 01:27:29,152
We understand how you feel...

869
01:27:29,237 --> 01:27:33,365
but you remember,
how, in years past...

870
01:27:33,407 --> 01:27:37,911
our beloved Pontiff
even when he was seriously ill...

871
01:27:37,995 --> 01:27:42,499
continued his pastoral commitment.

872
01:27:42,541 --> 01:27:46,544
Of course, we can't allow
more time to pass.

873
01:27:46,671 --> 01:27:49,923
In fact, I brought you
several sketches...

874
01:27:50,049 --> 01:27:54,177
for the Pontificate coat of arms.

875
01:27:54,303 --> 01:27:56,554
Here they are.

876
01:27:58,808 --> 01:28:01,393
Do any appeal to you?

877
01:28:03,562 --> 01:28:06,273
- This one.
- This one? - No, this one.

878
01:28:07,817 --> 01:28:11,444
It's simple, I think it's right.

879
01:28:11,570 --> 01:28:13,655
- Are you sure?
- No.

880
01:28:20,788 --> 01:28:24,958
Holiness, you were right.

881
01:28:25,084 --> 01:28:28,211
You had to reflect, be by yourself...

882
01:28:28,337 --> 01:28:33,591
but now I beg you,
do an act of obedience to the Lord.

883
01:28:33,718 --> 01:28:36,094
Come back to us.

884
01:28:37,471 --> 01:28:40,682
A billion people are waiting for you.

885
01:28:42,977 --> 01:28:45,687
Can't we make me vanish?

886
01:28:47,106 --> 01:28:48,606
I disappear.

887
01:28:50,234 --> 01:28:53,737
All this never happened,
no one has ever seen me.

888
01:28:53,863 --> 01:28:56,865
No one will ever see me again,
I promise you.

889
01:28:58,617 --> 01:29:01,453
Let me go away, please.

890
01:29:22,266 --> 01:29:26,603
Guys, you must be kidding!

891
01:29:26,645 --> 01:29:29,981
Stop, you can't do this to me.

892
01:29:30,024 --> 01:29:34,611
We have to play the two semifinals!
Then the winners...

893
01:29:37,156 --> 01:29:39,282
The Holy Father is watching us.

894
01:29:39,367 --> 01:29:43,370
It's not right to leave him
without a winning team.

895
01:29:43,412 --> 01:29:45,413
It's not right!

896
01:29:45,539 --> 01:29:49,626
Pescardona, are you saying
it was all useless?

897
01:29:51,545 --> 01:29:56,424
South America is in the semifinals,
you're the tournament's revelation!

898
01:29:56,550 --> 01:29:59,302
You're in the semifinals.

899
01:29:59,387 --> 01:30:03,932
- Let's play this semifinal!
- Professor, there's no more time.

900
01:30:04,058 --> 01:30:06,309
Why?

901
01:30:16,195 --> 01:30:18,279
Good morning.

902
01:30:18,322 --> 01:30:22,200
Thank you for responding
to my invitation...

903
01:30:22,326 --> 01:30:27,455
but the situation
has become very serious.

904
01:30:30,334 --> 01:30:32,710
I can no longer be silent.

905
01:30:32,837 --> 01:30:35,338
No doubt I made a mistake...

906
01:30:36,674 --> 01:30:41,553
and I take full responsibility
for what I've done.

907
01:30:42,555 --> 01:30:48,601
I tried, for the good of all,
to resolve a very difficult situation.

908
01:30:49,812 --> 01:30:53,690
But in so doing, I lied to you.

909
01:30:57,987 --> 01:31:01,614
The Pope hasn't been here with us
for three days.

910
01:31:02,825 --> 01:31:04,742
He has gone.

911
01:31:09,582 --> 01:31:12,208
I know where he is.

912
01:31:14,003 --> 01:31:16,129
I ask you to forgive me.

913
01:31:16,255 --> 01:31:19,507
It's my fault so much time
has passed.

914
01:31:21,093 --> 01:31:28,224
The moment has come for all of you
to make a decision.

915
01:31:28,267 --> 01:31:30,894
Forgive me once again.

916
01:31:40,404 --> 01:31:45,158
Is anyone against this proposal?

917
01:31:52,666 --> 01:31:54,375
Thank you.

918
01:31:54,418 --> 01:31:55,627
In favor?

919
01:32:12,144 --> 01:32:13,561
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

920
01:32:18,275 --> 01:32:19,901
Thank you.

921
01:32:19,944 --> 01:32:23,696
Food poisoning, really nothing.

922
01:32:23,822 --> 01:32:27,825
Food poisoning, a negligible episode.

923
01:32:27,952 --> 01:32:32,038
- What did they put in that omelet?
- I don't know. - Food poisoning.

924
01:32:32,081 --> 01:32:34,707
- Nothing serious.
- Thanks. - Thank you.

925
01:32:53,852 --> 01:32:58,314
- Why do you wear black all the time?
- I'm in mourning for my life.

926
01:32:58,357 --> 01:33:01,734
- I'm unhappy.
- Why? You're healthy.

927
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:05,863
Your father, although
he's not rich, is quite well off.

928
01:33:05,990 --> 01:33:08,825
I'm more miserable than you.

929
01:33:08,867 --> 01:33:11,244
I'm paid 23 rubles a month...

930
01:33:13,998 --> 01:33:18,376
I'm paid 23 rubles a month
and they take pension deductions.

931
01:33:18,502 --> 01:33:20,587
Still I don't wear mourning.

932
01:33:21,505 --> 01:33:24,007
Quiet!

933
01:33:24,842 --> 01:33:26,634
Money doesn't matter.

934
01:33:33,851 --> 01:33:37,520
Even a poor man can be happy.

935
01:33:37,646 --> 01:33:40,523
Yes, in theory, but not in reality.

936
01:33:40,649 --> 01:33:42,859
But not in reality.

937
01:33:43,861 --> 01:33:48,406
There's me, my mother,
my two sisters, my little brother...

938
01:33:48,532 --> 01:33:51,117
and 23 rubles...

939
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:53,911
23 rubles in all.

940
01:33:53,996 --> 01:33:57,040
We need to eat and drink!

941
01:33:57,166 --> 01:33:59,917
And tea?

942
01:34:00,044 --> 01:34:02,295
And tea...

943
01:34:04,548 --> 01:34:07,300
And sugar? And tobacco?

944
01:34:08,677 --> 01:34:10,511
Tobacco!

945
01:34:29,948 --> 01:34:31,783
- Now me?
- No!

946
01:34:31,825 --> 01:34:34,952
Treplyov, listening:
I hear footsteps.

947
01:34:35,037 --> 01:34:37,580
Enter the uncle, Treplyov embraces.

948
01:34:37,665 --> 01:34:40,416
"I cannot live without Nina."

949
01:34:40,459 --> 01:34:42,710
"I am madly happy!"

950
01:34:42,836 --> 01:34:46,798
He runs to meet Nina who enters.
Then with passion:

951
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:50,468
"My enchantress, my dream!"

952
01:34:50,594 --> 01:34:53,721
"I'm not late, am I?"

953
01:34:53,847 --> 01:34:57,183
Treplyov, kissing her hands:
"No, no..."

954
01:34:57,226 --> 01:35:00,853
Nina: "I've been in a fever all day."

955
01:35:00,938 --> 01:35:05,608
"I was afraid my father, but then..."

956
01:35:05,734 --> 01:35:08,486
".. he and my stepmother went out..."

957
01:35:08,570 --> 01:35:11,614
"..then I urged my horse!"

958
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:16,119
She squeezes Sorin's hands:

959
01:35:16,203 --> 01:35:18,746
"I'm so glad! So glad!"

960
01:38:25,809 --> 01:38:28,311
In these days...

961
01:38:31,064 --> 01:38:34,567
In these days
you must have asked yourselves...

962
01:38:34,693 --> 01:38:39,071
why doesn't our Pope
come to say hello?

963
01:38:39,948 --> 01:38:44,327
He mustn't worry
if the Lord chose him...

964
01:38:44,411 --> 01:38:47,038
He couldn't have made a mistake.

965
01:38:51,084 --> 01:38:53,544
Yes, I was chosen...

966
01:38:54,713 --> 01:38:57,214
but this...

967
01:38:57,299 --> 01:39:01,552
instead of giving me
strength and consciousness...

968
01:39:01,595 --> 01:39:05,348
it crushes me, confuses me.

969
01:39:10,354 --> 01:39:14,482
In this moment the Church needs
a guide who has the strength...

970
01:39:14,566 --> 01:39:18,986
to bring great changes...

971
01:39:19,112 --> 01:39:22,114
who seeks an encounter with all...

972
01:39:26,995 --> 01:39:31,874
who has, for all,
love and understanding.

973
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:46,263
I ask the Lord's forgiveness
for what I am about to do.

974
01:39:46,348 --> 01:39:49,475
I don't know if
He will be able to forgive me.

975
01:39:52,771 --> 01:39:57,733
But I must speak to Him
and to you with sincerity.

976
01:40:00,404 --> 01:40:03,531
In these days I've thought
very much about you...

977
01:40:03,657 --> 01:40:08,035
and I realize I am not able...

978
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:12,039
to bear the role entrusted to me.

979
01:40:20,549 --> 01:40:24,802
I feel I am among those
who cannot lead...

980
01:40:24,886 --> 01:40:28,889
but who must be led.

981
01:40:32,644 --> 01:40:36,188
In this moment I can only say:

982
01:40:36,273 --> 01:40:38,649
Pray for me.

983
01:40:40,193 --> 01:40:44,697
The guide that you need
is not me.

984
01:40:46,199 --> 01:40:48,784
I can't be the one.
