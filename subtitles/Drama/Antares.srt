1
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,831
Could you turn on the light for me?

2
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,712
No problem, mister.

3
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,832
Lady not here.

4
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,519
Me clean. No understand.

5
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,479
No understand. Lady not here.

6
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,919
Just look at this.

7
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,594
Someone tore 6 pages
out of this magazine.

8
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,438
Can you imagine?

9
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,230
Talk to the manager.
-Where is he?

10
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,193
Try the meat section.
-The nerve of some people.

11
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,192
All done?

12
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,835
Thank you.

13
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,270
Man...

14
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,748
Telephone.

15
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,719
Who?
-Me not know name.

16
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,992
Was it Frank, Herbert,
Mr. Ostermayer maybe?

17
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,189
It doesn't matter.

18
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,674
See you next Friday.

19
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,399
Thanks. Good-bye.

20
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,638
Huber is sick again.

21
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,631
Can you turn it down a little?

22
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,038
Can you get it?
-OK.

23
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,709
Hofstiitter.

24
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,636
Mom, can I stay over
at a girlfriend's tomorrow?

25
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,114
Which girlfriend?

26
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,755
Anna.

27
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,433
You don't know her.

28
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,393
Alright, but ask your dad too.

29
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,191
Slavicza has wreaked havoc
in my CD5 again.

30
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,756
I can't find any of my Schubert.

31
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,679
Dad, can I stay over
at a girlfriend's tomorrow?

32
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,952
Who is she?
-Anna. She's in the same grade as me.

33
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,434
What do you have planned?

34
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,551
Listen to music, study math.

35
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,069
Where do they live?
-They've got a house.

36
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,234
What do you think?
-it's fine with me.

37
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,395
OK.

38
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,551
We ought to look for a new place.

39
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,751
This development's going to pot.

40
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,239
<i>Bun appetit.</i>

41
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,552
What do your friend's parents do?

42
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,392
Her mother has a shop.

43
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,236
I don't know about her father.

44
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,149
I'm off. Bye.

45
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,030
Sleep tight.
-Have a good shift.

46
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,396
She's not here, she's on duty.

47
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,798
Rudolph Hospital.

48
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,548
Good-bye.

49
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,111
Who was that?
-It was for Mom.

50
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,509
Room 408, Ms. Machant.

51
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,716
Machant - unchanged.

52
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,877
Kovac too - unchanged.

53
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,429
Guess who called me yesterday.
-Who?

54
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,551
Schneider.
-Schneider who?

55
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,069
Dr. Schneider.

56
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,473
What did he want?

57
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,910
Blah, blah, how I'm doing,
what's new, is everything OK?

58
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,271
Whether I still go swimming
once a week? Shit like that.

59
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,193
I told him I don't really have
time for this...

60
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,589
Mrs. Reichold?

61
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,677
Vomited twice.

62
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,752
She's not doing too good at all.

63
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,479
Then suddenly he goes:

64
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,275
Mrs. Keinrath, I'll get back to you
in a couple of hours. Bye.

65
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,069
His wife probably walked in right then.

66
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,868
Mrs. Zipfer...
Being discharged tomorrow.

67
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,828
Granddaughter's picking her up...
-Really? Nice girl. I like her.

68
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,392
So then a few hours later
he really calls...

69
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,273
A man's last suit has no pockets.

70
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,832
We've lost sight of that,
thus our current global state.

71
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,719
Let's go to sleep, shall we?

72
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,118
A man's last suit has no pockets.

73
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,269
No.

74
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,432
I don't feel like sleeping.

75
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,158
I'd rather think.

76
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,158
If I don't, no one will.

77
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,116
What do you think about?

78
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,591
You don't know beforehand.

79
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,956
You can't will yourself to think,

80
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,517
you gotta let it happen.

81
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,632
Then ideas just come to you.

82
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,829
You try that
when you've got some time.

83
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,878
I'll make us some more coffee.

84
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,034
Has he fallen asleep?

85
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,158
No, not really, he's just dozing.

86
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,593
It's quiet tonight.

87
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,070
Morning.
-Morning.

88
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,438
Morning.
-Morning.

89
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,716
How was it?

90
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,989
Quiet.

91
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,430
Morning.

92
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,312
What are you doing in Vienna?

93
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,033
I wanted to see you again.

94
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,276
How did you know I work here?

95
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,959
I called your number.

96
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,158
Was that your daughter?

97
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,795
I didn't think
we'd see each other again.

98
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,875
How long are you staying?

99
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,316
I might be able to come back tonight.

100
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,274
I'll wait here.

101
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,918
What kept you?
-Things were chaotic last night. Bye.

102
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,635
Hello. You're late.

103
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,958
Coffee?
-Yes, please.

104
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,997
It was really chaotic.

105
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,989
The obscene elevator scribbler
struck again...

106
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,673
Yes, I noticed.

107
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,515
I'm on duty again tonight.

108
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,911
But we've got concert tickets.

109
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,192
I know, but Uschi is sick
and Monika's on vacation.

110
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,594
I'm sorry.

111
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,952
Why don't you call your sister?

112
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,111
She always says <i>she's so</i> lonely.

113
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,110
She locked herself out again.
What a scatterbrain.

114
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,873
I'm going for a jog.

115
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,074
Can you turn it down?
Your mom's sleeping.

116
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,514
Good morning.
Did you sleep well?

117
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,394
Listen to this:

118
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,519
Apartment in a brand-new building,
centrally located, 120 sq m,

119
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,116
open design, big terrace,
quiet courtyard.

120
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,594
What do you think?

121
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,274
Sounds good.
-Shall I call them?

122
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,358
Could we look at it?

123
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,319
Hofstiitter. Yes, thank you.
Good-bye.

124
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,712
Tomorrow at 1 p.m.

125
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,717
The obscene scribbler
struck again...

126
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,279
You told me already.

127
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,993
When?
-This morning.

128
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,076
Did I?

129
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,393
He plays with such intense passion.

130
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,433
Are you almost done?

131
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,999
Just a second.

132
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,793
Enjoy the concert.
-Thanks.

133
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,634
And say hi to Edith.
-I will. Bye.

134
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,832
Good evening.
Can you connect me with Mr. Tomas...?

135
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,396
I've forgotten his last name.

136
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,072
It was the seventh floor, room...

137
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,073
Forget it.

138
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,358
Wanna grab a bite?

139
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,994
Let's go straight to your place.
-OK.

140
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,268
A glass of wine?

141
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,871
You had it developed already?

142
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,515
Yes.

143
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,395
Do you like it?

144
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,194
Wait.

145
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,952
May I blindfold you?

146
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,638
How long can you stay?

147
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,438
Till tomorrow morning.

148
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,753
Then let's go out to dinner.

149
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,119
What's wrong?

150
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,434
Do you know her?

151
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,194
I don't think so.

152
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,438
Do you know her?
-Nope.

153
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,113
Yes you do, you know her.

154
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,232
I do not, how should I?
-You're lying.

155
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,677
You're back at her house?

156
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,551
And your friend's parents
let her stay out that late?

157
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,791
I'm back at the hospital.

158
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,312
The man you saw me with
was a colleague.

159
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,677
We went for a walk.

160
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,228
See you tomorrow.

161
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,478
Go down on me.
-Is that what you want?

162
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,558
The room-service waiter
watched you eating me out.

163
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,908
He was young, dark hair.

164
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,150
I wanted him to watch us.

165
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,990
I saw him come in.

166
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,879
Give me the camera.

167
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,233
I love you.

168
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,119
I love you.

169
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,553
I love you.

170
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,875
I've never fucked like this before.

171
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,229
Do whatever you want with me.

172
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,032
Spread your legs.

173
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,918
Now stroke yourself.

174
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,557
No, I can't.

175
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,038
Are you married too?

176
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,715
Children?

177
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,029
How old?

178
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,552
Five and seven.

179
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,633
How long are you staying?

180
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,869
My plane leaves tomorrow morning.

181
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,672
I can't come tonight.

182
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,158
Please don't stop.

183
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,472
Here's my number at the hospital.

184
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,240
Call me there instead,
if you want.

185
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,839
I'll miss you.

186
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,236
I better be going. Take care.

187
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,914
How was it?

188
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,394
Quiet.

189
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,837
And your concert?
-Good.

190
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,355
We're looking at that place today.
-When?

191
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,629
At one.

192
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,712
I better get some sleep then.

193
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,235
What about breakfast?
-I ate at work.

194
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,509
Sweet dreams.

195
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,989
How was it?

196
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,758
What?
-With your girlfriend?

197
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,633
Uh, OK.

198
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,035
We're looking at an apartment.
Want to come?

199
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,389
No, I have to study.

200
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,074
We have to leave in fifteen minutes.

201
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,159
I'll be ready in a sec.

202
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,748
I don't understand this.
-Maybe he forgot.

203
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,995
Let's go home.

204
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,394
Let me call him.

205
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,076
This is Hofstiitter.
We had an appointment at one.

206
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,999
Why aren't you here?
We're waiting for you.

207
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,271
We've been waiting for 20 minutes.
Why didn't you cancel?

208
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,794
What did you say?

209
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,794
What about my time?

210
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,388
He's not coming,
he already rented the place.

211
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,479
He has no qualms about wasting our time.
I won't stand for this.

212
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,998
I'm calling his agency.

213
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,111
The nerve of that guy.

214
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,035
Answering machine.
-it's Sunday.

215
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,475
I'm not letting them treat me this way.

216
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,273
Can we just go home?

217
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,516
The nerve of him. He's not normal.

218
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,314
You don't care.
-What makes you think that?

219
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,556
I'm no sucker.
And you don't even care.

220
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,320
That's not true,
but it's no use, it's Sunday.

221
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,239
I make an effort and no one cares.

222
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,557
What do you mean?
-I make an appointment, no one shows.

223
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,194
I get concert tickets,
you have to work.

224
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,476
What?

225
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,990
We discussed this.
A colleague got sick, it's not my fault.

226
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,112
I told you 2 months ago...
-You are so egotistical.

227
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,993
That's your opinion.
-Can we please just go?

228
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,552
Can I go to my friend's again?

229
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,796
What about your homework?
-I'm done.

230
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,712
What do you say?
-Fine with me.

231
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,712
Alright, but be back by eight.

232
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,876
I left something in the car.
Where are the keys?

233
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,274
Over there.

234
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,549
Thanks.

235
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,154
I'll be right back.

236
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,152
Hello, it's me, Eva.

237
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,279
You're there at the hotel

238
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,669
in our room.

239
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,918
<i>What are you doing?</i>

240
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,038
Looking at your pictures.

241
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,151
<i>What do you plan to do with them?</i>

242
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,399
Take them with me.

243
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,999
They turned out nice.

244
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,188
Come here.

245
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,839
Are you still there?

246
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,509
<i>Come here.</i>

247
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,639
If only I could...

248
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,114
But I can't.

249
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,316
21 channels and nothing but crap.

250
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,272
<i>What a joke.</i>

251
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,557
These German film titles.

252
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,192
"The Dummy Crisis".

253
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,913
You scared me.

254
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,078
You're so nervous today.
-You just startled me.

255
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,235
What if we go to the movies tonight?

256
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,316
The movies?

257
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,636
Why not?
We haven't done that in a long time.

258
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,832
I've circled 3.
This one got good reviews...

259
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,436
Alright.

260
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,432
Are you OK?
-Why shouldn't I be?

261
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,194
There's something wrong...
-No, I'm fine.

262
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,436
What time does it start?
-7:30.

263
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,750
Don't move, I'll get a broom.

264
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,749
I'll call Iris to tell her
we're going out.

265
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,994
What was that?

266
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,919
Over there I think.

267
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,517
Did she scream for help?

268
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,676
Huh]

269
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,396
Probably just a marital quarrel.

270
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,399
Probably.

271
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,991
Back to the real estate section.

272
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,516
High time we got out of this place.

273
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,115
That weirdo again.
-Did he say anything?

274
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,072
They never say anything.

275
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,031
I'll have it traced next time.

276
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,433
Let's go to bed?

277
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,392
Do you want to go first?

278
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,753
No, go ahead.

279
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,590
Could you turn on the light for me?

280
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,279
No problem, mister.

281
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,438
You shouldn't be smoking
when you're pregnant.

282
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,159
I'm not pregnant.

283
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,874
Not pregnant?

284
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,389
I just said that because of Marco.

285
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,629
He wants a baby so bad.
We'd get married.

286
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,353
And he really thinks you're...

287
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,235
We even bought wallpaper
for the nursery.

288
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,396
How long has this been going on?

289
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,715
Two months.

290
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,552
I don't believe it.

291
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,676
Men are so stupid.

292
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,272
What's so funny?

293
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,598
I figured I'd tell him
and get pregnant right after.

294
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,630
I ovulate this weekend.

295
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,638
It could work,
people have premature babies.

296
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,398
Two months...

297
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,638
All I can say is "good luck".

298
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,913
Just look at this.

299
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,549
Someone tore 6 pages
out of this magazine.

300
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,478
Can you imagine?

301
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,474
Talk to the manager.
-Where is he?

302
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,274
Try the meat section.
-The nerve of some people.

303
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,514
Bottle receipt?

304
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,279
19.20, please.

305
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,989
Thank you.

306
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,275
Hey baby.

307
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,560
I'm on ladder now,
I call you right back.

308
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,513
I'm on ladder,
I call back. OK, ciao.

309
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,197
What a fox.

310
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,359
You think she screams
when you screw her?

311
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,312
Or does she just lie there?

312
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,431
I dunno, I first have to try her.

313
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,194
Shit.

314
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,279
I forgot.

315
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,755
Moment.

316
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,230
Marco, what's wrong with you?
You said you'd call right back.

317
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,000
You made me wait
like a fool for an hour.

318
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,192
If I say I'll call right back,
I call right back.

319
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,357
You don't love me.

320
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,038
Where are you anyway?

321
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,514
Who with?

322
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,389
And who else?

323
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,877
Nobody. Robert and me.

324
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,399
And billboard.

325
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,068
You know.

326
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,713
I come soon.

327
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,436
Ciao.

328
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,312
She is jealous woman.
-She's got good reason to be.

329
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,431
What reason? No reason.

330
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,879
I love her with my life.
-You people amaze me, man.

331
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,196
Hey, you marry with Astrid,

332
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,072
you know
whole life you fuck one woman.

333
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,431

You have only to use logic.

00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,195
She good woman. Strongwoman.

362
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,110
When we fuck, she's really loud.
I love that.

363
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,793
I'm wild about her.

364
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,077
When she comes,
she makes the strangest sound.

365
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,759
Never heard anything like it.

366
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,228
What sound she make?

367
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,398
It's hard to describe. Like yodeling.

368
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,555
Yodeling?

369
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,870
Not yodeling, but kinda like it.

370
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,149
I can't describe it.

371
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,311
Wow baby, I need a drink.

372
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,278
You must to try Bambus.

373

375
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,392

00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,393
Baby, there you are,

377
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,868
We go have drink.

378
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,073
What are we drinking to?
-Toast to my son.

379
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,353
Sonia is so good woman.

380
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,516
When doctor say she got pregnant,

381
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,352
no more cigarettes, no alcohol...

382
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,152
Nothing.
-That's great.

383
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,438
Isn't it boring not being able
to drink or smoke?

384
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,074
Not if you know why you're doing it.

385
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,910
Is cool song. C'mon, let's dance.

386
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,719
You sure got a sweet boyfriend.
-I know.

387
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,715
Saw you shakin' your fanny
with the Yugos.

388
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,558
Yeah, I dance if I have to.

389
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,796
Look, we put up these billboards too.

390
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,434
Right Marco? That's our work.

391
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,358
All billboards is our work.

392
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,513
What do you wanna do now?
-I have idea.

393
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:52,311
What?

394
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,556
We drive to place I know.

395
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,394
Good idea. You drive, I roll.

396
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,156
Go easy, is strong shit.

397
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,388
Here, Sonia.

398
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:09,593
Hey, she is pregnant woman.

399
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:10,915
Sorry.

400
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,078
I forgot.

401
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,751
You're so skinny.

402
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,514
People always think I'm pregnant,
but I'm not.

403
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,956
I think you're perfect.

404
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,230
Love handles.

405
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,557
Not like the floozies
on those billboards of yours?

406
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,792
They're not bad either, huh?

407
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:31,956
Yeah right...

408
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,951
Hey Astrid, my favorite song.
I teach you lyric.

409
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,913
"Long time ago..."

410
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:40,591
Uh, forget it.

411
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,349
He sing about a man who
leave his wife and become a rich man.

412
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,313
He lose all his money,
and then he go back.

413
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,516
Why he go back?
Nobody know. Just he know why.

414
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,189
And now

415
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:57,749
he say he make big mistakes.

416
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,868
Now he come back to see wife
before he die.

417
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,037
"...before I die." You like?
-Great lyrics.

418
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,840
Pretty, but sad.
-Is same like real life.

419
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,678
What's so sad about it?

420
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,077
First he leaves her
and then he's all remorseful.

421
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,719
It's just a song.

422
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,395
You're not leaving me,
though, are you?

423
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,795
Not anytime soon.

424
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,592
Listen, listen. Song continues.

425
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,517
Baby, what's the problem?

426
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,715
Baby, tell me.

427
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,798
You couldn't take your eyes off her
all evening.

428
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,353
You and your Astrid.

429
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:09,959
Baby, baby.

430
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,155
Do I do that to you?
You think I'm stupid?

431
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:16,272
You think I'm blind and don't see it?

432
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:19,717
I don't do that to you.
-You and your silly head...

433
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,358
You don't love me.

434
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,398
But baby, I love only you.

435
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:31,513
You don't call when you say you will.
I always call if I say so.

436
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,280
Baby,
I told you already I was on ladder.

437
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,190
Astrid is Robert's girlfriend.

438
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,591
My woman is you, only you.

439
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,710
<i>Really?</i>

440
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,031
You are mother of my child.

441
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,468
Let's go upstairs.

442
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,913

I hear baby.
-Marco, that's impossible.

445
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,352
It's this big.

446
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,948
Like a worm.

447
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,748
Yes, yes I hear, small sound.

448
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,712
Marco, that's impossible.

449
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,157

Visiting her grandpa at the hospital.
What do you want from her?

Honey, please say something.

487
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,670
I thought you didn't love me anymore.

488
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,108
That's not true.

489
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:36,630
But sometimes is difficult, Sonja.
-Then you're not angry?

490
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,152
C'mon, don't cry.

491

Come here.

492

Robert must think I'm completely crazy.

We go for walk.

494
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,470
I go for walk with Fipsi.
-OK.

495
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,796
Fipsi, going for another walk so late?

496
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,918
First walk only last 10 minute,
poor Fipsi.

497
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,799
OK, see you.

498
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:13,555
See you.

499
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,758
I don't know any Marco.

500
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,630
My name's Mario. Bye.

501
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:56,196
OK, ciao.
-Ciao Marco.

502
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:01,954
Ciao Fipsi.

503
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,350
Come by tomorrow.
Mario won't be here

504
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,949
and we can be wilder.
-I dunno...

505
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,639
I call you, yes?

506
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:19,360
I want to go for walk,
but turn into marathon.

507
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,433
Hello honey.

508
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,559
I'm tired.

509
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,112
We do it tomorrow, OK?

510
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:54,314
Hi. It's Sonia. ls Marco there?

511
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:59,192
Nothing.
It's just he forgot his cell phone.

512
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,196
Bye.

513
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,636
Hello, awake already?

514
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:16,675
Mario?

515
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:20,878
Yes he's right here, but who are you?

516
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:23,676
Hello?

517
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,872
Baby, brush.

518
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,595
Finished.

519
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,556
Is good, yes?
-Nice.

520
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:17,397
You don't like?
-I do, it's great. Fine.

521
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,194
I do job like pro.
-Yeah, great.

522
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:26,791
I feel like smoking cigarette.
-Go ahead, have one.

523
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:30,353
It's OK?
-We can open the window afterwards.

524
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:32,198
You allow me?
-Yes.

525
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,198
I do just one time.

526
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:43,074
Maybe we should have taken
the teddy bear wallpaper?

527
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,679
No, that's too dark.

528
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,791
Baby must to have light.

529
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:48,708
Better this one.

530
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,159
Better I smoke on balcony.

531
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:15,835
Baby...

532
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,394
You sleeping?

533
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:23,194
I go for walk with Fipsi.
-OK.

534
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:37,589
Baby?

535
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,473
Shit.

536
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:20,758
Marco Jukic.
My girlfriend swallow pills.

537
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:25,349
Mitterhofergasse 2,
apartment 5, section...

538
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:27,790
Uh, apartment 32, section V.

539
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,389
Moment, I must to look...

540
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:35,748
Different pills...

541
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:39,748
Mogadon and Halcion.

542
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:42,995
Moment.

543
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,511
Yes, breathing, breathing.

544
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,153
Come quick. Please.

545
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:22,236
Sonia, wake up.

546
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:28,634
Yes, yes.

547
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:34,272
Breathing, yes.

548
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:36,988
In bed,

549
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:39,235
on back, yes.

550
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,033
Hi Kurt. Hello.

551
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:56,076
Patient ingested a mixture
of Mogado, Halcion,

552
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:57,633
and alcohol.

553
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:00,070
We found her lying unconscious
on her bed.

554
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:19,390
Please, not going to die, no?
-Don't worry. Wait outside.

555
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:22,273
Here are pills she swallow.
-I know, thank you.

556
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:48,230
We have a room for you now, Doctor.
We'll wake you in time.

557
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:52,597
I'd like to leave this.
For Eva Hofstiitter.

558
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,239
I'll see her in the morning.

559
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:55,919
Internal medicine ward.

560
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:57,473
I know Eva.

561
01:12:51,652 --> 01:12:53,847
Don't take shit from nobody,
remember that.

562
01:13:01,732 --> 01:13:03,006
Surprise.

563
01:13:03,332 --> 01:13:04,606
What's that for?

564
01:13:04,852 --> 01:13:06,604
I shot it for you.

565
01:13:10,852 --> 01:13:12,888
I bought a convertible.

566
01:13:13,572 --> 01:13:15,688
A Le Baron. Color: petrol.

567
01:13:16,052 --> 01:13:16,802
Great.

568
01:13:17,012 --> 01:13:19,845
Want to see it?
-No time. I'm waiting for someone.

569
01:13:21,732 --> 01:13:22,847
It's down in the garage.

570
01:13:24,292 --> 01:13:25,281
You can't park there.

571
01:13:25,492 --> 01:13:27,289
What?
-You don't live here anymore.

572
01:13:27,492 --> 01:13:31,610
What's so hard about going downstairs
to check out my new wheels?

573
01:13:37,612 --> 01:13:40,888
You read about the
new car smuggling ring?

574
01:13:41,412 --> 01:13:44,085
Turks and Polacks,
they'll rob you blind.

575
01:13:45,212 --> 01:13:46,201
Better not mess with me.

576
01:13:46,412 --> 01:13:47,811
Let me show it to you.

577
01:13:48,052 --> 01:13:50,088
You know I don't care about cars.

578
01:13:52,092 --> 01:13:54,970
OK. Maybe next time.
We can go for a little drive.

579
01:14:00,612 --> 01:14:02,125
Please leave.

580
01:14:20,612 --> 01:14:23,604
Way to go Mario.
There, blow up the asteroid.

581
01:14:26,692 --> 01:14:28,205
Get lost, now.
-In a minute.

582
01:14:28,452 --> 01:14:29,646
I said now.

583
01:14:29,852 --> 01:14:32,525
Sorry about the vase,
no hard feelings, huh.

584
01:14:32,732 --> 01:14:36,725
I don't give a damn about the vase.
Get out of my apartment.

585
01:14:36,932 --> 01:14:38,729
Why so nervous? I won't hurt you.

586
01:14:38,972 --> 01:14:40,883
Don't take no shit, right Mario?

587
01:14:41,492 --> 01:14:43,448
Get out of my apartment.

588
01:14:47,172 --> 01:14:48,048
Get your foot out.

589
01:14:48,252 --> 01:14:49,970
You don't get it, that's the problem.

590
01:14:50,172 --> 01:14:52,288
Get your foot out of my door.
-Alright.

591
01:14:53,852 --> 01:14:56,002
Look at you,
you're totally hysterical.

592
01:14:59,172 --> 01:15:01,049
Totally hysterical.

593
01:15:15,692 --> 01:15:19,241
You're a thug, a common thug.

594
01:15:32,092 --> 01:15:33,889
Hey man, that your car?
-Yeah, so what?

595
01:15:34,092 --> 01:15:35,286
No standing, man.

596
01:15:35,492 --> 01:15:37,801
I ain't allowed to be here?
-You block my parking.

597
01:15:38,012 --> 01:15:40,321
I ain't allowed?
-Move the car.

598
01:15:40,532 --> 01:15:43,171
Don't shit your pants, Yugo,
you got plenty of room.

599
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:45,966
Move the shit.
-What did you say?

600
01:15:46,212 --> 01:15:49,648
Move the shitcar.
-What did you say about my car?

601
01:15:50,292 --> 01:15:51,361
Move the shit.

602
01:15:51,572 --> 01:15:53,688
Why so nervous, boy?
Got a problem?

603
01:15:53,892 --> 01:15:57,601
You asking for problem?
-A Yugo twerp ain't no problem for me.

604
01:16:01,132 --> 01:16:02,565
Rabitsch speaking, hello.

605
01:16:05,452 --> 01:16:06,885
Just a second.

606
01:16:07,452 --> 01:16:09,727
Don't you dare scratch my car.

607
01:16:10,092 --> 01:16:11,889
So, what do we have for you?

608
01:16:12,132 --> 01:16:13,485
Let's see, there's

609
01:16:14,172 --> 01:16:15,321
tomorrow.

610
01:16:15,812 --> 01:16:17,530
How about ten o'clock?

611
01:16:19,172 --> 01:16:20,730
Then maybe

612
01:16:21,372 --> 01:16:22,930
two o'clock. OK?

613
01:16:25,372 --> 01:16:28,444
House number 53,
I'll be waiting inside the apartment.

614
01:16:29,412 --> 01:16:30,925
Thank you. Good-bye.

615
01:16:54,012 --> 01:16:55,161
Come here.

616
01:16:55,572 --> 01:16:56,641
Don't be scared.

617
01:16:58,452 --> 01:17:00,886
Wow, you got nice car.

618
01:17:01,092 --> 01:17:02,047
Thanks.

619
01:17:02,692 --> 01:17:04,205
How about the two of us?

620
01:17:04,412 --> 01:17:05,686
How much?

621
01:17:07,252 --> 01:17:09,083
Blow job - 50,

622
01:17:09,452 --> 01:17:11,647
you want more, you pay a little extra.

623
01:17:12,932 --> 01:17:16,163
I got an alarm system too,
to keep Polacks off my car.

624
01:17:17,572 --> 01:17:19,528
So, what about us?

625
01:17:20,852 --> 01:17:21,967
Too expensive.

626
01:17:22,852 --> 01:17:25,082
What you want anyway?
-I wanna fuck.

627
01:17:25,292 --> 01:17:27,203
Normal fuck?
-Yeah, normal.

628
01:17:27,412 --> 01:17:29,972
How much you pay for fucking?
-Nothing.

629
01:17:30,772 --> 01:17:33,366
Nothing.
Because I don't need this.

630
01:17:33,572 --> 01:17:36,769
I can have any woman I want, for free.
Now get lost.

631
01:17:39,052 --> 01:17:40,451
Stinkin' slut.

632
01:17:47,932 --> 01:17:50,400
Stinkin' sluts, every last one of 'em.

633
01:18:06,532 --> 01:18:08,762
Great, the agency gave me
my own apartment.

634
01:18:13,412 --> 01:18:16,529
Mom, you gotta see a doctor,
I can't help you there.

635
01:18:18,812 --> 01:18:22,407
Next week looks bad, I'm so busy.
I'll call you. Bye.

636
01:19:22,892 --> 01:19:24,291
Hello, Rabitsch.

637
01:19:24,932 --> 01:19:27,810
Mr. Gruber, we spoke on the phone today.
Come in.

638
01:19:28,052 --> 01:19:29,326
Feel at home.

639
01:19:29,532 --> 01:19:31,807
Come in. Feel at home.

640
01:19:32,332 --> 01:19:34,323
When is it due?
-In two weeks.

641
01:19:35,052 --> 01:19:36,405
I have a son, this tall.

642
01:19:37,212 --> 01:19:39,521
With a little tasteful decoration...

643
01:19:40,252 --> 01:19:42,607
We'd have to tear out the tiles.

644
01:19:42,812 --> 01:19:44,803
Once you move in,

645
01:19:45,012 --> 01:19:47,207
you'll give the place
your own personal touch.

646
01:19:47,492 --> 01:19:48,891
Bathtub for two.

647
01:19:49,132 --> 01:19:50,121
Do you like it?

648
01:19:50,332 --> 01:19:51,606
I bet you like that.

649
01:19:51,812 --> 01:19:54,326
This is for the washing machine,
the sink...

650
01:19:54,532 --> 01:19:56,602
This would be the entrance hall.

651
01:19:57,292 --> 01:19:58,930
How cute. What's its name?

652
01:19:59,132 --> 01:20:00,247
Sammy.

653
01:20:00,932 --> 01:20:02,365
Living room...

654
01:20:04,012 --> 01:20:06,003
A bit dark, isn't it?

655
01:20:06,292 --> 01:20:08,886
Yes well,
it's kind of a hazy day today.

656
01:20:09,932 --> 01:20:12,571
No foreigners in this house,
family friendly,

657
01:20:12,772 --> 01:20:14,603
dog friendly, animal friendly.

658
01:20:19,852 --> 01:20:22,605
As a matter of fact,
the vibrations here are better.

659
01:20:23,012 --> 01:20:25,321
What's that odd-looking thing?

660
01:20:28,052 --> 01:20:30,520
Well, that's a cute little idea.

661
01:20:31,452 --> 01:20:33,841
A round window,
to let in extra light

662
01:20:34,092 --> 01:20:36,526
because this would probably
be the TV area.

663
01:20:37,012 --> 01:20:39,651
What about the nursery?
It'll be cramped.

664
01:20:39,892 --> 01:20:42,452
The nursery...
It is kinda small, huh?

665
01:20:42,972 --> 01:20:45,645
It's a two-room apartment.
That's what the ad said.

666
01:20:45,852 --> 01:20:47,570
We thought it would be bigger.

667
01:20:48,292 --> 01:20:50,681
And here's the extra bonus:

668
01:20:50,892 --> 01:20:53,804
An 80 sq m terrace in heart of the city.

669
01:20:54,012 --> 01:20:56,401
You can't even just walk out onto it...

670
01:20:57,052 --> 01:20:59,361
And this wall protects your privacy.

671
01:20:59,572 --> 01:21:03,884
You can grow ivy on it,
or Virginia creeper or whatever...

672
01:21:04,132 --> 01:21:05,804
Do you like it?
-No.

673
01:21:06,012 --> 01:21:09,448
Because we hope
one day he'll have a big family

674
01:21:09,692 --> 01:21:11,762
with lots of kids
running around all day.

675
01:21:11,972 --> 01:21:13,928
Does it face south?
-Southeast.

676
01:21:15,412 --> 01:21:17,846
That office building is awfully close...

677
01:21:26,732 --> 01:21:27,562
Sit.

678
01:21:29,812 --> 01:21:30,642
Down.

679
01:21:34,292 --> 01:21:35,327
Sit.

680
01:21:38,412 --> 01:21:39,288
Down.

681
01:21:39,612 --> 01:21:41,568
Nice dog.
Can I give him a nibble?

682
01:21:46,212 --> 01:21:47,440
Is that a Le Baron?

683
01:21:47,652 --> 01:21:49,051
<i>3.0 L V6.</i>

684
01:21:49,252 --> 01:21:51,208
Horsepower?
-140.

685
01:21:52,772 --> 01:21:54,171
Come. Heel.

686
01:22:12,812 --> 01:22:14,882
New vase.
-I don't want to see you anymore.

687
01:22:15,092 --> 01:22:16,889
And something for the vase.

688
01:22:17,092 --> 01:22:18,650
Sorry about yesterday.

689
01:22:29,092 --> 01:22:30,127
Thank you.

690
01:22:33,012 --> 01:22:35,242
Mario wet his bed again.

691
01:22:36,252 --> 01:22:38,004
He didn't get that from me.

692
01:22:38,212 --> 01:22:40,726
Where is he, in his room?
-Can't you hear him?

693
01:22:44,932 --> 01:22:46,524
Could you stop coming here?

694
01:22:46,772 --> 01:22:49,240
Nicole, I want to talk to you.

695
01:22:49,492 --> 01:22:50,811
Like normal people.

696
01:22:51,012 --> 01:22:53,765
But you won't listen to me,
that's the problem.

697
01:22:53,972 --> 01:22:55,803
OK, then talk.

698
01:23:02,252 --> 01:23:04,288
I sold an apartment yesterday.

699
01:23:04,572 --> 01:23:06,449
The third one this week.

700
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:09,041
Do you know what that is?

701
01:23:09,252 --> 01:23:10,401
It's an agency record.

702
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:14,042
That's what you wanted to say?
-I just want to talk to you.

703
01:23:14,252 --> 01:23:15,367
I don't want you around.

704
01:23:15,612 --> 01:23:17,921
I'm tired of being beaten
every other day,

705
01:23:18,132 --> 01:23:20,600
of getting in trouble for
forgetting your beer,

706
01:23:21,172 --> 01:23:23,481
of getting raped...
-Don't start this shit again.

707
01:23:23,692 --> 01:23:25,967
I was mad 'cause
you didn't wanna fuck.

708
01:23:26,212 --> 01:23:28,521
I'm tired of fucking
whenever you feel like it.

709
01:23:28,732 --> 01:23:31,724
You don't understand
what goes on up here.

710
01:23:31,972 --> 01:23:34,167
Then tell me and then leave.

711
01:23:36,692 --> 01:23:37,886
Listen Nicole.

712
01:23:41,332 --> 01:23:43,323
These are hard times for you,

713
01:23:44,932 --> 01:23:47,321
I know,
what with the separation and all...

714
01:23:48,452 --> 01:23:50,522
But you have to come to grips
with yourself.

715
01:23:50,732 --> 01:23:52,370
You're just distraught.

716
01:23:54,852 --> 01:23:56,888
Come to grips with myself?

717
01:23:57,692 --> 01:23:58,283
Yes.

718
01:23:59,012 --> 01:24:00,445
I'm distraught?

719
01:24:00,692 --> 01:24:01,488
Yes.

720
01:24:10,652 --> 01:24:11,880
How are you?

721
01:24:12,412 --> 01:24:13,845
What are you doing?

722
01:24:18,212 --> 01:24:20,123
Yes, I'm waiting for you.

723
01:24:21,012 --> 01:24:22,843
Can't wait to see you.

724
01:24:24,852 --> 01:24:26,001
No, he's here.

725
01:24:32,132 --> 01:24:33,087
Look at this.

726
01:24:33,332 --> 01:24:34,970
I think he hurt himself.

727
01:24:35,212 --> 01:24:36,691
Can I call you back?

728
01:24:38,132 --> 01:24:40,168
What have you done.
-Look at this.

729
01:24:42,372 --> 01:24:44,044
Wait. Sit down.

730
01:24:44,252 --> 01:24:45,321
Hold still.

731
01:24:47,452 --> 01:24:49,443
What's that?
-iodine.

732
01:24:51,292 --> 01:24:52,407
Does it burn?
-Naw.

733
01:24:52,852 --> 01:24:55,491
Your present, I almost forgot.
Want me to get it?

734
01:24:55,692 --> 01:24:57,410
I don't want any presents.

735
01:25:00,812 --> 01:25:02,768
Daddy hurt himself.
Doesn't matter.

736
01:25:03,012 --> 01:25:04,809
Minor cut, nothing serious.

737
01:25:05,652 --> 01:25:08,007
Come down with me and
see my convertible.

738
01:25:08,212 --> 01:25:10,328
I don't care about your convertible.

739
01:25:12,292 --> 01:25:14,248
Then I'll bring it up. I don't mind.

740
01:25:14,652 --> 01:25:15,926
Is that OK?

741
01:25:16,172 --> 01:25:17,161
Does it hurt?

742
01:25:22,172 --> 01:25:22,809
Here.

743
01:25:23,052 --> 01:25:25,282
Give it to your new girlfriend.
-Come on.

744
01:25:26,372 --> 01:25:27,600
You like the color?

745
01:25:28,132 --> 01:25:31,761
It was either silver or petrol,
but I figure petrol is cooler.

746
01:25:34,812 --> 01:25:35,767
Let's go for a drive.

747
01:25:35,972 --> 01:25:37,200
Alex, I don't want to.

748
01:25:37,452 --> 01:25:38,601
That's OK.

749
01:25:41,692 --> 01:25:42,920
You'll come around.

750
01:25:47,852 --> 01:25:48,807
Look.

751
01:25:54,972 --> 01:25:56,166
Alarm system.

752
01:25:56,372 --> 01:25:57,487
Sure you don't want to?

753
01:25:57,972 --> 01:25:59,007
Next time.

754
01:26:19,092 --> 01:26:20,207
Bye.

755
01:26:34,452 --> 01:26:35,771
Come over here.

756
01:26:36,332 --> 01:26:37,447
Come on.

757
01:26:39,292 --> 01:26:40,202
How are you?

758
01:26:40,412 --> 01:26:41,288
Fine.

759
01:26:41,492 --> 01:26:43,562
Thought about it?
You and me, baby?

760
01:26:43,772 --> 01:26:46,002
Blow job - 50.
Fucking - 200.

761
01:26:46,572 --> 01:26:50,611
Hey, do I look like someone
who has to pay for a fuck?

762
01:26:51,092 --> 01:26:53,845
Do I look like someone
who has to pay for a fuck?

763
01:26:54,372 --> 01:26:55,407
Look at me.

764
01:26:56,452 --> 01:26:59,012
Do you really think I need that?

765
01:27:00,892 --> 01:27:02,723
Go ahead and think it over.

766
01:27:28,452 --> 01:27:30,807
Come quick, there's idiot here.

767
01:27:53,972 --> 01:27:55,530
What are you doing here?

768
01:27:55,772 --> 01:27:57,888
Just standing.
Ain't nothing against that?

769
01:27:58,092 --> 01:28:02,005
This here is a no parking zone.
-Yeah? I hadn't noticed.

770
01:28:05,972 --> 01:28:09,169
Hey, are you crazy?
You can't piss in my car.

771
01:28:09,372 --> 01:28:12,284
What car?
It's as good as gone.

772
01:28:12,692 --> 01:28:14,887
You heard the man: no parking zone.

773
01:28:39,452 --> 01:28:41,204
Lousy, fuckin' bitches.

774
01:29:08,492 --> 01:29:09,368
Shit.

775
01:29:17,892 --> 01:29:19,803
I know.
I had another appointment.

776
01:29:20,012 --> 01:29:22,242
I'll be there in ten minutes.
Bye.

777
01:29:33,332 --> 01:29:34,401
<i>Assholes.</i>

778
01:29:40,052 --> 01:29:42,725
There they are, those jerks.

779
01:29:48,692 --> 01:29:50,091
Hello, Rabitsch.

780
01:29:50,292 --> 01:29:52,362
Sorry, I had another appointment.

781
01:29:52,932 --> 01:29:54,285
Come in.

782
01:29:56,372 --> 01:29:57,407
Sorry.

783
01:30:00,732 --> 01:30:01,482
Well?

784
01:30:02,292 --> 01:30:03,725
We'll think about it.

785
01:30:04,492 --> 01:30:05,845
Think about it.

786
01:30:06,332 --> 01:30:07,731
Good-bye.

787
01:30:09,452 --> 01:30:12,171
Sorry, we won't be taking it.
It's too expensive.

788
01:30:12,372 --> 01:30:13,885
Go fuck yourself.

789
01:30:14,372 --> 01:30:15,566
I beg your pardon?

790
01:30:16,492 --> 01:30:17,607
Go fuck yourself.

791
01:30:17,852 --> 01:30:19,410
C'mon, let's get out of here.

792
01:30:45,132 --> 01:30:46,690
<i>Won't understand this.</i>

793
01:30:47,372 --> 01:30:49,681
<i>Maybe he forgot.</i>

794
01:31:06,772 --> 01:31:08,444
The apartment's already taken.

795
01:31:10,812 --> 01:31:13,167
What do you want from me?
It's taken.

796
01:31:15,852 --> 01:31:18,412
Don't you think
I've got better things to do?

797
01:31:19,012 --> 01:31:21,731
The apartment is gone.
Time is money, man.

798
01:31:22,332 --> 01:31:24,971
Your time ain't worth
diddly squat to me.

799
01:31:48,212 --> 01:31:48,883
Somethin' wrong?

800
01:31:55,932 --> 01:31:57,843
I said it's over...
-Gotta talk to you.

801
01:31:58,052 --> 01:32:00,327
I don't want to talk.
Get your foot out.

802
01:32:01,132 --> 01:32:03,248
Alex stop it. I'll scream.

803
01:32:03,492 --> 01:32:05,164
In front of Mario?

804
01:32:05,372 --> 01:32:06,566
He's at my mother's.

805
01:32:06,772 --> 01:32:08,808
Then we got the place to ourselves.

806
01:32:11,812 --> 01:32:12,608
Help!

807
01:32:12,812 --> 01:32:15,565
Stop being ridiculous.
I just want to talk.

808
01:32:20,172 --> 01:32:21,605
You left this in the car.

809
01:32:21,852 --> 01:32:24,491
I don't want it.
Give it to your new floozy.

810
01:32:24,692 --> 01:32:26,489
Very funny. Now take it.

811
01:32:27,932 --> 01:32:29,285
Or I'll get angry.

812
01:32:34,412 --> 01:32:36,880
Look Nicole.
Let's be reasonable.

813
01:32:42,092 --> 01:32:44,606
I hit you again,
but that's not what I want.

814
01:32:45,052 --> 01:32:46,644
You just don't get it.

815
01:32:57,212 --> 01:32:59,009
This is our Chinese restaurant.

816
01:32:59,252 --> 01:33:01,447
I always used to get the chicken.

817
01:33:07,412 --> 01:33:08,640
Swimming pool.

818
01:33:11,132 --> 01:33:12,087
Look,

819
01:33:13,252 --> 01:33:15,083
remember that old jacket?

820
01:33:20,212 --> 01:33:21,406
Amazing.

821
01:33:21,852 --> 01:33:24,889
Look, I still had long sideburns here.

822
01:33:28,252 --> 01:33:30,322
And this is

823
01:33:31,772 --> 01:33:35,162
carnival 1997.
I puked for three days after that.

824
01:33:39,852 --> 01:33:41,968
I missed an appointment this morning.

825
01:33:42,212 --> 01:33:44,328
Kept those jerks waiting half an hour.

826
01:33:45,372 --> 01:33:46,566
Who are you calling?

827
01:33:51,772 --> 01:33:53,364
That's the police.

828
01:33:55,012 --> 01:33:56,570
Are you dense or something?

829
01:33:56,772 --> 01:33:59,445
We don't need the police,
I'm not hurting you.

830
01:34:04,172 --> 01:34:05,685
Where was this?

831
01:34:11,612 --> 01:34:13,409
Maybe in Schwechat?

832
01:34:15,172 --> 01:34:17,242
We sure make a great-looking couple.

833
01:34:18,452 --> 01:34:19,362
Cheers.

834
01:34:27,172 --> 01:34:29,925
Nicole, your problem is you don't talk.

835
01:34:30,852 --> 01:34:32,444
I've got my flaws too.

836
01:34:32,652 --> 01:34:35,724
Look, I don't have a new girlfriend,
I just said that.

837
01:34:35,972 --> 01:34:39,089
Women are stupid anyway,
except for you.

838
01:34:40,172 --> 01:34:43,130
I've got someone new.
-I know, consider it forgotten.

839
01:34:43,332 --> 01:34:44,924
No problem, I forgive you.

840
01:34:50,892 --> 01:34:53,167
I'm dying to see
how this looks on you.

841
01:34:54,892 --> 01:34:56,450
If I try it on, will you leave?

842
01:34:56,652 --> 01:34:58,483
Yeah, put it on... Please.

843
01:35:02,292 --> 01:35:03,566
Great.

844
01:35:04,092 --> 01:35:05,047
Fits great.

845
01:35:05,252 --> 01:35:06,287
I'm cold.

846
01:35:06,492 --> 01:35:08,323
OK. Get dressed.

847
01:35:08,892 --> 01:35:09,961
Thanks.

848
01:35:18,012 --> 01:35:19,604
Can you go now?

849
01:35:20,452 --> 01:35:23,808
Not until you get it through your head
that I love you.

850
01:35:24,772 --> 01:35:27,491
That just doesn't seem to sink in.

851
01:35:30,372 --> 01:35:32,932
Good evening.
I'd like to order some food.

852
01:35:34,812 --> 01:35:37,406
Mitterhofgasse 2,

853
01:35:38,052 --> 01:35:39,405
section IX,

854
01:35:40,532 --> 01:35:42,090
apartment 27.

855
01:35:45,652 --> 01:35:47,722
Hold on. I'll call back in a second.

856
01:35:48,332 --> 01:35:49,481
Help!

857
01:36:21,652 --> 01:36:23,051
It's me again.

858
01:36:23,932 --> 01:36:24,682
Yes.

859
01:36:24,892 --> 01:36:28,202
I'd like a pizza Capricciosa
and a Del Amore.

860
01:36:29,652 --> 01:36:30,721
Excellent.

861
01:36:30,932 --> 01:36:31,887
Bye.

862
01:36:40,852 --> 01:36:43,047
Sorry, but you leave me no choice?

863
01:36:48,412 --> 01:36:50,482
Do you want to throw all this away?

864
01:36:52,212 --> 01:36:53,247
And this?

865
01:36:55,412 --> 01:36:57,801
What more do you expect me to do?

866
01:37:03,892 --> 01:37:05,007
I'm sorry.

867
01:37:08,332 --> 01:37:10,641
Everything's going wrong,
I don't know why.

868
01:37:11,772 --> 01:37:15,162
It's 'cause you won't listen to me,
Nicole, I love you.

869
01:37:15,612 --> 01:37:17,921
You're the most kick-ass woman
in the world.

870
01:37:25,332 --> 01:37:27,687
Can't you just leave me alone?

871
01:37:35,732 --> 01:37:37,245
That's beside the point.

872
01:37:37,492 --> 01:37:39,289
OK, I made a mistake,

873
01:37:39,892 --> 01:37:42,850
but I've changed.
You must have noticed.

874
01:37:43,052 --> 01:37:44,804
Why do you think I'm doing all this?

875
01:37:45,012 --> 01:37:47,367
The roses, lingerie,
vase, the convertible.

876
01:37:47,572 --> 01:37:50,211
What can I do
to make you understand?

877
01:37:51,612 --> 01:37:53,250
You always blow things.

878
01:37:53,452 --> 01:37:55,522
I plan a nice evening
and you go and ruin it.

879
01:37:55,732 --> 01:37:57,688
How do you expect us
to go on this way?

880
01:37:58,452 --> 01:38:00,488
I don't, we're through.

881
01:38:00,732 --> 01:38:03,565
You're the one who doesn't get it.

882
01:38:13,692 --> 01:38:14,363
Is that him?

883
01:38:15,532 --> 01:38:16,681
Don't you dare hurt him.

884
01:38:18,452 --> 01:38:20,044
I don't have to take this.

885
01:38:32,852 --> 01:38:33,967
Sorry man, I come see...

886
01:38:34,212 --> 01:38:36,168
No problem, come in.
Nicole's here.

887
01:38:36,812 --> 01:38:38,882
How cute, what's its name?

888
01:38:39,292 --> 01:38:40,645
Hi there, Fipsi.

889
01:38:42,972 --> 01:38:44,644
I don't stay long...
-No problem.

890
01:38:45,612 --> 01:38:47,603
Lock the rat in the bedroom, Yugo.

891
01:38:54,412 --> 01:38:55,401
Close the door.

892
01:38:58,532 --> 01:38:59,328
Move.

893
01:39:01,732 --> 01:39:02,687
Hi.

894
01:39:06,612 --> 01:39:07,601
Sit down.

895
01:39:19,452 --> 01:39:22,330
That's him.
The Yugo with the ridiculous Renault?

896
01:39:22,732 --> 01:39:24,404
That's him.

897
01:39:24,612 --> 01:39:26,807
With knife you big strongman.

898
01:39:27,532 --> 01:39:28,487
Bravo.

899
01:39:28,972 --> 01:39:30,849
Bravo, your man is realman.

900
01:39:33,412 --> 01:39:35,164
I'm strong without the knife, boy.

901
01:39:37,532 --> 01:39:38,203
Get up.

902
01:39:38,572 --> 01:39:39,561
Don't.

903
01:39:39,852 --> 01:39:40,921
Stop it.

904
01:39:41,452 --> 01:39:43,283
Get up. Or ain't you got the balls?

905
01:39:47,452 --> 01:39:48,965
Got the message, boy?

906
01:39:49,212 --> 01:39:51,487
You're such an asshole.

907
01:39:52,092 --> 01:39:54,242
Get out of my life,
out of my apartment.

908
01:39:54,452 --> 01:39:56,329
I don't need your roses.

909
01:39:56,532 --> 01:39:57,806
I hate you.

910
01:39:58,092 --> 01:39:59,286
I hate you.

911
01:39:59,612 --> 01:40:01,887
But Nicole, that's not true.

912
01:40:03,132 --> 01:40:04,360
You're bleeding.

913
01:40:04,652 --> 01:40:07,212
Is it broken?
-No, I need napkin.

914
01:40:07,452 --> 01:40:09,090
Come to the bathroom.

915
01:40:09,772 --> 01:40:11,330
He's such an asshole.
I'm sorry.

916
01:40:11,532 --> 01:40:13,170
You die.

917
01:40:14,292 --> 01:40:15,691
I don't have to take this.

918
01:40:26,652 --> 01:40:28,244
He's always been an asshole.

919
01:40:28,492 --> 01:40:29,720
I'm so sorry.

920
01:40:33,932 --> 01:40:36,082
He'll always be an asshole.

921
01:40:38,372 --> 01:40:40,363
At least nothing's broken.

922
01:40:40,692 --> 01:40:41,841
Does it burn?
-No.

923
01:40:44,212 --> 01:40:46,328
I don't fuckin' have to take this.

924
01:41:34,012 --> 01:41:35,001
What the fuck...

925
01:41:36,212 --> 01:41:37,611
Fuckin' piece of shit.

926
01:41:41,892 --> 01:41:42,927
Never again.

927
01:41:46,492 --> 01:41:47,561
Never again.

928
01:41:59,132 --> 01:42:00,167
Shut up.

929
01:42:05,412 --> 01:42:06,640
Piece of shit clunker.

930
01:42:09,572 --> 01:42:10,766
<i>Assholes.</i>

931
01:42:18,492 --> 01:42:19,891
I don't believe this.

932
01:42:21,332 --> 01:42:22,651
Damn it.

933
01:42:44,732 --> 01:42:46,882
The gentleman has already checked out.

934
01:42:48,212 --> 01:42:49,531
Gone for good?

935
01:42:50,212 --> 01:42:54,330
He checked out an hour ago.
-He must have taken the earlier flight.

936
01:42:54,532 --> 01:42:56,841
May I go up to his room,
I forgot something.

937
01:42:57,052 --> 01:42:59,122
I'll send up a maid.

938
01:42:59,332 --> 01:43:01,800
Can I take care of it myself?
It's personal.

939
01:43:02,372 --> 01:43:04,169
I'm afraid I can't do that...

940
01:43:04,372 --> 01:43:06,090
Please, it's very important.

941
01:43:08,052 --> 01:43:09,087
Please.

942
01:43:42,012 --> 01:43:43,730
Here you go.
-Thank you.

943
01:43:43,932 --> 01:43:45,365
Is it broken?

944
01:43:45,572 --> 01:43:46,687
My arm, yes.

945
01:43:46,972 --> 01:43:49,281
That lunatic ran a red light back there,

946
01:43:49,492 --> 01:43:51,244
am I glad nothing worse happened...

947
01:43:51,452 --> 01:43:53,761
There should be some pictures
in the car.

948
01:43:54,372 --> 01:43:55,805
I dropped them.

949
01:43:56,292 --> 01:43:57,486
I'll have a look.

950
01:43:57,732 --> 01:43:58,608
Thanks.

951
01:44:24,492 --> 01:44:25,368
It's me.

952
01:44:28,892 --> 01:44:31,531
Please stop shouting at me.
I'm in a hotel.

953
01:44:32,372 --> 01:44:33,600
No, I'm not alone.

954
01:44:33,812 --> 01:44:35,484
I'll be staying here tonight.

955
01:44:37,092 --> 01:44:40,641
No, I don't want a divorce.
I just have a lover.

956
01:44:42,932 --> 01:44:45,366
Let's talk about it tomorrow.
Good night.

957
01:45:02,012 --> 01:45:03,240
It's me again.

958
01:45:03,452 --> 01:45:06,364
Wait.
I forgot to mention I have the car.

959
01:45:06,572 --> 01:45:09,132
You'll have to take the subway tomorrow.
Bye.

960
01:45:12,372 --> 01:45:14,203
Everything's the way it should be.

961
01:45:16,892 --> 01:45:18,962
We have a good life together.

962
01:46:43,732 --> 01:46:44,687
Dead?

963
01:46:47,492 --> 01:46:48,811
Car accident?

964
01:46:54,132 --> 01:46:55,611
Thank you. Bye.

965
01:47:07,652 --> 01:47:08,562
Here you go.

966
01:47:13,852 --> 01:47:15,331
Want a sandwich?

967
01:47:31,692 --> 01:47:32,841
Hey baby.

968
01:47:39,132 --> 01:47:41,362
Nurse give me vase.

969
01:47:43,252 --> 01:47:45,163
I ran into door.

970
01:47:45,652 --> 01:47:47,085
Was so nervous.

971
01:47:48,892 --> 01:47:50,803
Dying isn't hard at all.

972
01:47:52,012 --> 01:47:53,047
Strange.

973
01:47:54,812 --> 01:47:56,484
Baby, why you did this?

974
01:47:56,772 --> 01:47:58,205
Is no reason to.

975
01:48:03,532 --> 01:48:05,727
Because I lost the baby.

976
01:48:10,092 --> 01:48:12,162
But baby, no problem.

977
01:48:12,372 --> 01:48:14,010
We make new baby.

978
01:48:17,012 --> 01:48:19,162
You say baby so small like worm,

979
01:48:19,692 --> 01:48:21,011
so small.

980
01:48:23,612 --> 01:48:25,170
How's Fipsi?

981
01:48:45,252 --> 01:48:46,367
Bye.

982
01:48:49,332 --> 01:48:51,721
Well, do they know what I have yet?

983
01:48:51,932 --> 01:48:53,570
Still haven't found a thing.

984
01:48:53,772 --> 01:48:57,401
You're a mystery, Mr. Riedel.
-Not to me, I know what I have.

985
01:48:57,612 --> 01:48:59,728
I think you're making a fool of us all.

986
01:49:00,212 --> 01:49:02,521
People make fools of themselves.

987
01:49:15,692 --> 01:49:17,364
I know you from housing.

988
01:49:17,572 --> 01:49:19,324
We live in same housing.

989
01:49:20,092 --> 01:49:21,002
Hello.

990
01:49:21,332 --> 01:49:22,560
I want ask question.

991
01:49:23,332 --> 01:49:26,449
My girlfriend in hospital.
