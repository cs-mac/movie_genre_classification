00:15:18,297 --> 00:15:21,066
Well, round here there's
the missionary folk... they's

159
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:23,935
Hardshell Baptists and then
there's the free will folks which is

160
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:25,070
your Softshell Baptists.

161
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:26,406
Right now I preach for both.

162
00:15:28,007 --> 00:15:29,240
[ KNOCK AT DOOR ]

163
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:30,476
I'll get it.

164
00:15:31,477 --> 00:15:34,266
Daniel is gonna preach tonight
over at the missionary.

165
00:15:36,282 --> 00:15:38,049
I never was religious myself.

166
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,218
- It's Sephus, mama.

167
00:15:41,619 --> 00:15:42,787
Hello, Elma...

168
00:15:43,788 --> 00:15:45,190
Mrs. Knightes

169
00:15:45,191 --> 00:15:46,260
- Hello, Sephus.

170
00:15:47,251 --> 00:15:49,228
I come to have a word with your new boarder,

171
00:15:51,349 --> 00:15:52,365
if he don't mind.

172
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:56,602
Excuse me.

173
00:16:12,718 --> 00:16:15,420
Claims he's the fella the union sent us.

174
00:16:17,823 --> 00:16:18,757
             Can you prove it? 

175
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:23,995
        Don't take nothing to have
           a card printed up.

176
00:16:25,798 --> 00:16:28,066
 I guess you'll just have to trust me.

177
00:16:30,236 --> 00:16:32,171
        Who wrote "The Iron Hill"?

178
00:16:33,172 --> 00:16:35,907
          Jack London.
  - Where's Joe Hill buried at?

179
00:16:36,108 --> 00:16:39,310
    All over the world.
They scattered his ashes.

180
00:16:39,311 --> 00:16:41,746
Which eye is Big Bill Hayward missing?

181
00:16:46,152 --> 00:16:48,753
         His right one.
  - How did Frank Little die?

182
00:16:48,754 --> 00:16:52,023
Butte, Montana.
They hung him from a railroad trestle.

183
00:16:54,894 --> 00:16:57,128
     - You know your stuff.

184
00:16:57,129 --> 00:17:00,498
I was with the Wobbley's.
        - Me too,

185
00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:02,133
 back when it meant something.

186
00:17:03,602 --> 00:17:07,238
        One big union.
    - Not around here buddy.

187
00:17:08,941 --> 00:17:10,308
          C.E. Lively...

188
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:13,511
 this is my restaurant.
Fellas are waitin'.

189
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,887
 They don't give a damn
whether we live or die

190
00:17:22,888 --> 00:17:25,657
  just so long as they get
the coal out of the ground.

191
00:17:25,658 --> 00:17:29,427
They had us pulling pillars and
the roof was working, you know

192
00:17:29,428 --> 00:17:32,030
like it does before it's going to fall down.

193
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:34,933
 If I say I ain't dying in here
         and walk away

194
00:17:34,934 --> 00:17:38,703
they'll put me down
in some damn puddle in a 2 foot seam

195
00:17:38,704 --> 00:17:42,941
  and no air to breathe...
  A man can't mine coal that way.

196
00:17:42,942 --> 00:17:45,710
They're just pushing us
further than we can go.

197
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:48,413
 - The check wayman he'll take
50 pound off your load for slate

198
00:17:48,414 --> 00:17:49,814
when there ain't a pebble in it.

199
00:17:49,815 --> 00:17:52,751
 It's down in the bottom he'll say
 where they ain't no looking for it.

200
00:17:52,852 --> 00:17:55,787
Then they raise the prices at
the Company Store the same goddamn week

201
00:17:55,788 --> 00:17:57,655
that they lower the tonnage rate.

202
00:17:57,656 --> 00:17:59,991
And they still ain't rock dusted
        that damn hole.

203

 [ PREACHER ]  Who'm I talking about?
            - Jesus

    I can't hear you!
            - Jesus!

205
00:18:04,363 --> 00:18:07,298
    I still can't hear you!
            - Jesus!!

206

  Jesus Christ our lord!
  Do you know His name?

207

     Hallelujah, say yeah!

208
00:18:11,837 --> 00:18:17,775
Have you felt the warming
 comfort of His precious love?

209
00:18:17,776 --> 00:18:20,078
          Praise Jesus!

210

     Praise His holy name!

Praise His blessed spirit!

  Praise His everlasting love!
    Jesus Christ our lord!

213
00:18:29,355 --> 00:18:32,457
Listen to me now, listen to me.

 Lord of untruth, sower of evil seed,
enemy of all that is good

  and pure and this creature

224

        walks among us.

225
00:19:23,008 --> 00:19:26,244
 What are we gonna do about it?

226
00:19:51,303 --> 00:19:54,238
 First thing we got to have is
 all of these niggers

227
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,708
and all these dagos that come
in here to take our jobs

228
00:19:56,739 --> 00:19:57,810
             thrown out of the mines.

229
00:19:57,951 --> 00:20:00,715
Mines, hell! They got 'em in our houses,

230
00:20:00,746 --> 00:20:02,317
they're setting at our tables right now

231
00:20:02,348 --> 00:20:05,019
and they're sleeping in our beds
 while we're out living under a

232
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,955
 piece of canvas at
          the back of the hollar.

233
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:09,757
I been a union man my whole life.

234
00:20:09,788 --> 00:20:13,328
I know the story with these
coal operators and their gun thugs.

235
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:16,828
 The only thing they understand
  is the bad end of a bullet.

236
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:20,365
If we show 'em, we just as soon
 blow up their damn mines than

237
00:20:20,366 --> 00:20:23,968
 seen them worked by a bunch of scabs
and then they gonna listen.

238
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:27,805

He got someone.

239
00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:47,525
    Where did you find him?

240
00:20:47,826 --> 00:20:49,727
 He come right up on the steps.

241
00:20:49,828 --> 00:20:54,158
They told me that C.E. Lively's
is where the union mens meet.

242
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:55,034
              So?

243
00:20:57,669 --> 00:20:59,270
    I got business with the union.

244
00:21:01,573 --> 00:21:03,208
          That so?

245
00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:04,890
     What's your name, son?

246
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:08,346
They calls me "Few Clothes".
        [ LAUGHS ]

247
00:21:10,383 --> 00:21:12,200
 I didn't come here
 looking for no trouble.

248
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:14,766
    A mans got to eat.

249
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,027
 - So why don't you go eat,
 back where you come from?

250
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:18,903
They told me that they was jobs here.

251
00:21:18,934 --> 00:21:21,692
    - Go home nigger.
                      - Goddamn scab.

252
00:21:23,028 --> 00:21:25,397
You watch your mouth peckerwood!

253
00:21:29,802 --> 00:21:32,807
I been called nigger and I can't
help that's the way white folks is,

254
00:21:32,838 --> 00:21:35,709
but I ain't never been called no scab!

255
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,211
 And I ain't fixin' to start up now.

256
00:21:41,512 --> 00:21:44,509
 I'll go ton for ton loading coal
    with any man here.

257
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:48,619
  And when I do, I expects the
 same dollar for the same work.

258
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:53,524
You get out of this hollar alive son,
you be doin' good for yourself.

259
00:21:52,925 --> 00:21:53,925

260
00:21:58,464 --> 00:22:00,365
    Union men my ass.

261
00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:12,944
You want to be treated like men?

262
00:22:14,445 --> 00:22:16,114
  You want to be treated fair?

263
00:22:17,515 --> 00:22:19,944
You ain't men to that coal company.

264
00:22:21,285 --> 00:22:22,920
        You're equipment

265
00:22:23,521 --> 00:22:26,257
 like a shovel, a gondola car,

266
00:22:26,858 --> 00:22:28,957
     a hunk of wood brace.

267
00:22:30,328 --> 00:22:33,798
 They'll use you til you
 wear out or you break down,

268
00:22:34,099 --> 00:22:37,635
 or your buried under a slate fall
 and then they'll get a new one.

269
00:22:37,736 --> 00:22:38,003

270
00:22:38,204 --> 00:22:41,873
 And they don't care what color
 it is or where it comes from.

271
00:22:42,874 --> 00:22:44,942
It doesn't matter how much
coal you can load

272
00:22:45,033 --> 00:22:47,905
  or how long your family
  has lived on this land.

273
00:22:48,646 --> 00:22:53,857
 If you stand alone
you just so much shit to those people.

274
00:22:58,023 --> 00:23:00,124
You think this man is your enemy?

275
00:23:03,195 --> 00:23:04,363
             Huh?

276
00:23:06,064 --> 00:23:08,399
    This is a worker.

277
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,572
 Any union keeps this man out

278
00:23:11,603 --> 00:23:13,841
         ain't a union,

279
00:23:13,872 --> 00:23:16,340
      it's a goddamn club.

280
00:23:17,643 --> 00:23:20,378
Now they got you fighting
white against colored,

281
00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:23,548
 native against foreign,
 hollar against hollar,

282
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:27,652
 when you know there ain't but
two sides to this world...

283
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:29,954
  them that work and them that don't.

284
00:23:29,955 --> 00:23:31,088
        You work,

285
00:23:31,089 --> 00:23:32,951
          they don't.

286
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:36,760
That's all you got
to know about the enemy.

287
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:42,334
     You say you got guns.

288
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,576
  Well I know that you all
  are brave men

289
00:23:51,947 --> 00:23:56,202
 and I know you could shoot it out
with the company if you had to.

290
00:23:56,713 --> 00:23:56,813

291
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:59,787
But the coal company
don't want this union

292
00:24:00,418 --> 00:24:02,390
 and the state government
 don't want it.

293
00:24:02,421 --> 00:24:04,956
  The federal government
  don't want it.

294
00:24:04,957 --> 00:24:08,393
And they're all of them just
waiting for an excuse to come down

295
00:24:08,424 --> 00:24:09,961
       and crush us to nothin'.

296
00:24:13,198 --> 00:24:16,801
 Fellas, we're in a
 hole full of coal gas here.

297
00:24:17,902 --> 00:24:21,806
 The tiniest spark at the wrong time
is going to be the end of us.

298
00:24:22,707 --> 00:24:22,740

299
00:24:23,976 --> 00:24:26,311
 So we got to pick away at this situation

300
00:24:26,442 --> 00:24:28,781
         slow and careful.

301
00:24:30,182 --> 00:24:32,783
  We got to organize and build support.

302
00:24:33,986 --> 00:24:36,037
    We got to work together.

303
00:24:36,688 --> 00:24:37,989
        Together!

304
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:41,259
 Til they can't get their coal
  out of the ground without us

305
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,526
     cuz we're a union!

306
00:24:43,162 --> 00:24:46,266
Cuz we're the workers damn it!
And we take care of each other.

307
00:24:48,267 --> 00:24:51,369

 That's what a union is fellas.

You better get used to it.

316
00:25:31,443 --> 00:25:34,578
 So this fella owns a vineyard,
goes out first thing one morning

317
00:25:34,579 --> 00:25:36,113
and he hires some workers.

That dago's just driving me crazy.

342

    Now what's he playing?
            - Shhhh...

 for his foreman and he says to

go pay off the workers starting with
the ones he picked up just

351
00:28:28,985 --> 00:28:32,290
an hour ago and to pay
everyone of them the same dollar a day.

352
00:28:32,321 --> 00:28:34,361
 And of course the fellas
that went out first

353
00:28:34,392 --> 00:28:36,027
    is roped off about this.

354
00:28:37,028 --> 00:28:39,763
So they get to agitating,
  complaining so loud that the

355

           "Look it,

00:28:41,566 --> 00:28:45,269
we dealt for a dollar
and that's what you get.

357

And what I pay anybody else
is none of your look out, so there."

358
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,691
Now that's all the gospel story says
except for the moral Jesus

359

        drew out of it.

360

    And so Jesus says,

361
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:02,601
 Thus it will be in the kingdom
of heaven the first will be last

 and the last will be first.

363
00:29:06,825 --> 00:29:08,706
Now it's clear from this parable

364
00:29:08,737 --> 00:29:11,308
that Jesus hadn't heard nothin'
    about the union.

       and there's a spark.

430

    Keep out of this.

457
00:36:13,885 --> 00:36:15,219
Look, I only got one room left.

458
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:18,088
- Well then, somebody is going to
have to move, don't they?

459
00:36:18,389 --> 00:36:22,292
Let me see your register?
    - You ain't seein' nothin'.

460
00:36:24,028 --> 00:36:28,051
Lady, we're here as guests of
the Stone Mountain Coal Company.

461
00:36:28,132 --> 00:36:29,499
      They own this house.

462
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,669
        - Good mornin'.

463
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:34,071
     You fellas movin' in?

464
00:36:34,072 --> 00:36:35,572
             Yeah.
              - No.

465
00:36:35,573 --> 00:36:39,276
  Well, you wont find
a better night's sleep anywheres in town.

466
00:36:39,677 --> 00:36:43,113
It's a shame I got to
move over to the hotel.

467
00:36:43,114 --> 00:36:45,716
    It's business you know.

468
00:36:47,418 --> 00:36:50,188
So you mind if I settle my bill, ma'am?

469
00:36:51,789 --> 00:36:54,992
Danny, you sign these
two gentleman in.

470
00:37:01,966 --> 00:37:04,134
 Don't think the Company
isn't going to hear about this.

471
00:37:17,615 --> 00:37:21,084
Boy, sometimes you got to bend
     so as you don't break.

472
00:37:22,957 --> 00:37:24,888
Food's awful at the hotel.

473
00:37:25,889 --> 00:37:27,791
      Mattresses got lumps,

474
00:37:27,792 --> 00:37:30,128
     probably cooties, too.

475
00:37:32,329 --> 00:37:34,231
    I'll be all right.

476
00:37:36,234 --> 00:37:39,669

          -Thank you.

Now, if you want to
stay alive down here,

478
00:37:50,982 --> 00:37:53,984
you got to listen up,
get a hold of something solid,

479
00:37:54,085 --> 00:37:56,922
  and give the top a little poke.

480
00:37:56,988 --> 00:38:01,258
Now, if you get a nice ringing sound
         you're all set.

481
00:38:03,061 --> 00:38:05,729
 Got a nice solid top over your head.

482
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:10,167
     You get a kinda hollow sound,

483
00:38:10,208 --> 00:38:14,638
like a drum, that slate's sagging a bit,

484
00:38:14,681 --> 00:38:17,881
 and you gotta put in another post.

485

You dig coals a long time?
- Since I was 10. And you?

We make a shoe.

 As soon as they get that union
     they'll send us back.

              Yes...

Now suppose they let us in
this union like they say.

Your doing union business, ain't ya?

  How you like Mrs. Radnor's?

Well there wasn't room.
I'm at the hotel now.

 Well, pleased to meet you.
 My name is Bill Hickey.

This is Tom Griggs.

 You can do what you want
 up at the coal camp,

but this is town property.

- Stone Mountain holds the deeds
     on these houses, Cabell.

- You need a writ for eviction.

Then you can help us.
Now these people are trespassing on

They all signed a contract that
 they wouldn't join any union.

You uh, you Baldwin-Felts agency?

Stone Mountain Coal Company.

 and this is from our boss,
 Mr. Thomas Felts.

      I've met Mr. Felts.

Well good, we won't have any problem.

Neither of these will do for a writ.

You'll have to see a judge in Charleston.

What if we ain't got time
to go to Charleston?

541

Then you better find some.
Now I can't do nothin' about what you

pull outside town limits,

   I'll put you under arrest.

      You and whose army?

00:42:42,073 --> 00:42:46,634
 All you men own a gun,
 go home and get it.

If the rest of the boys was here
you wouldn't be so cocky.

553

  If the rest of the boys was
 here, I'd give you 5 minutes.

 Just acovered with gore.

907
01:15:25,701 --> 01:15:27,001
            Dogs didn't do all that.

908
01:15:29,805 --> 01:15:31,372
  Are you drawing breath, son?

909
01:15:31,873 --> 01:15:35,244
    Baldwins, we were sold...

910
01:15:36,045 --> 01:15:36,944
   - What's your name?

         - Kin to Nimrod Purcell?

01:15:46,354 --> 01:15:47,955
     That's daddy's uncle.

915
01:15:49,224 --> 01:15:51,222
Say some Baldwin agents took ya?

01:15:53,295 --> 01:15:55,063
          From behind.

917
01:15:55,364 --> 01:15:58,866
 - None of them Purcells
 ever was too bright.

Grab his ankles missus and mind your dress.

919
01:16:03,072 --> 01:16:05,206
He's ableedin' like a stuck pig.

920
01:16:16,452 --> 01:16:18,820
  I found 'em boys, he's here.

921
01:16:23,892 --> 01:16:25,227
         - It's Reese.

922
01:16:35,204 --> 01:16:36,871
     Got yourself a martyr.

923
01:16:39,308 --> 01:16:41,509
     I tried to stop this.

924
01:16:43,479 --> 01:16:45,447
      See any sign of Sephus?

925
01:16:47,249 --> 01:16:50,118
We'll maybe smell him before we see him.

926
01:16:56,525 --> 01:16:57,952
     They found somebody?

927
01:16:57,993 --> 01:17:00,996
  Just stay right here, honey,
don't want to look at that mess.

928
01:17:01,497 --> 01:17:03,631
But, I got somethin for Mr. Kenehan.

929
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:07,769
I don't think he's in no mood
to be bothered right now.

930
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:09,704
      I'll see he gets it.

01:17:13,876 --> 01:17:18,412
 Oh, just some poor miner
 whose troubles is finally over.

933
01:17:19,882 --> 01:17:21,159
    Don't look, honey.

934
01:17:23,318 --> 01:17:27,422
 I talked to Ellix.
He says your phonograph machine

935
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:30,225
is going to be fixed in a couple days now.

936
01:17:31,026 --> 01:17:33,328
  It's awful nice of you to do, Everett.

937
01:17:33,929 --> 01:17:37,665
Well, we got to take care of
our favorite lady now, don't we?

938
01:17:39,335 --> 01:17:41,406
    - You been so generous...

939
01:17:41,443 --> 01:17:44,032
thinking about me when that Mr. Kenehan

940
01:17:44,073 --> 01:17:46,573
got you all so busy with the union.

941
01:17:48,644 --> 01:17:50,948
That Mr. Kenehan is what I come
  to talk to you about, Bridey.

942
01:17:53,982 --> 01:17:58,252
 I got a suspicion he
might not be what he says he is.

943
01:17:59,153 --> 01:18:00,521
    What do you mean?

944
01:18:05,861 --> 01:18:07,328
            Bridey,

945
01:18:07,729 --> 01:18:10,731
did you send Kenehan some sort of letter?

946
01:18:36,992 --> 01:18:38,126
    What do you want?

947
01:18:39,995 --> 01:18:41,763
              No.

948
01:18:42,064 --> 01:18:44,032
          He wouldn't.

949
01:18:44,433 --> 01:18:47,568
There's a whole crowd of fellas
  standing around him,

950
01:18:47,769 --> 01:18:50,054
 I seen Kenehan laughing and waving that letter.

951
01:18:50,105 --> 01:18:52,076
             So, I

952
01:18:52,107 --> 01:18:54,475
  come over to see what was so funny.

953
01:18:55,911 --> 01:18:58,313
    A lot of fellers?

954
01:19:01,783 --> 01:19:04,318
You mind if i have another drink, honey?

955
01:19:06,688 --> 01:19:08,789
It ain't pretty what I gotta say.

956
01:19:21,236 --> 01:19:23,401
  He said some things, Bridey...

957
01:19:23,438 --> 01:19:28,443
  "She been following me around
     ever since I got here.

958
01:19:28,644 --> 01:19:32,513
"Trailing after me
like a dog in heat.

959
01:19:32,614 --> 01:19:35,443
 "Sniffing around my legs
 like a brood bitch.

960
01:19:35,484 --> 01:19:38,809
  "She don't wear no drawers",
  he says, "so she can be ready for

961
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:40,815
whatever stumbles down the pathway."

962
01:19:40,856 --> 01:19:42,590
          He didn't!

963
01:19:47,763 --> 01:19:49,564
        He didn't!

964
01:19:51,967 --> 01:19:55,136
He said you done it
with one of the coloreds.

965
01:19:56,672 --> 01:19:58,473
         Lying bastard!

966
01:19:58,674 --> 01:19:59,807
            Bridey,

967
01:19:59,976 --> 01:20:02,543
 I think it might be worse than that.

968
01:20:03,344 --> 01:20:05,907
I think he might be a spy

969
01:20:05,948 --> 01:20:08,075
  in with the coal operators.

970
01:20:08,316 --> 01:20:12,186
  Well, he's got the fellas so
turned around with all his talk...

971
01:20:14,156 --> 01:20:16,380
I need for you to help me, Bridey,

972
01:20:16,401 --> 01:20:19,894
 and sometimes you gotta tell
 a little bit of a lie

973
01:20:19,995 --> 01:20:23,264
 just to get the truth across.

974
01:20:24,566 --> 01:20:26,531
    We fight them with guns

975
01:20:26,568 --> 01:20:28,169
            we lose.

976
01:20:29,671 --> 01:20:31,505
  That's the whole damn story.

977
01:20:33,075 --> 01:20:35,870
 I'm not going to bullshit
you fellas and tell you there won't

have us all murdered.

 But, if we don't stand together now

981
01:20:43,151 --> 01:20:47,088
as workers, we got no hope at all.

he's all drunk and
 everything and I says as how

989

I didn't want to have nothin'
 to do with him

990
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:41,139
  and I would call some of you fellers

         for help and

992
01:21:43,979 --> 01:21:46,877
  he says that all of you was

993
01:21:47,915 --> 01:21:50,184
        taken care of.

994
01:21:51,253 --> 01:21:53,085
      Taken care of, huh?

995
01:21:53,121 --> 01:21:57,425

weren't no help I ...

997
01:22:05,067 --> 01:22:07,201
        forced me, he...

998
01:22:07,384 --> 01:22:09,954
         he forced me.

999
01:22:10,205 --> 01:22:12,440
                     - Easy...  

1000
01:22:14,676 --> 01:22:18,579
- That's okay.
You better hear this first hand. 

1001
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:20,982
 Go ahead honey, what happened then?

1002
01:22:24,753 --> 01:22:27,851
    And afterwards he

1003
01:22:27,889 --> 01:22:31,859
 thrown money on the bed like
I were some kind of a whore.

1004
01:22:38,366 --> 01:22:39,567
You done just fine, honey.

1005
01:22:42,170 --> 01:22:45,646
Now why don't you go sit outside
for a minute while we figure out

1006
01:22:45,707 --> 01:22:47,475
  what we're going to do about this.

1009
01:23:03,859 --> 01:23:06,508
You know how Bridey builds things up.

01:23:07,039 --> 01:23:09,331
      Take a look at this

 - It's a death warrant is what,

1017
01:24:24,539 --> 01:24:25,574
           - Miners?

1018
01:24:26,675 --> 01:24:28,510
    How'd you manage that?

1019
01:24:29,211 --> 01:24:31,512
That tramp that goes to
meet the passenger train.

1020
01:24:31,713 --> 01:24:34,515
Seems she's got the eye for Kenehan.

1021
01:24:34,716 --> 01:24:38,285
 So he put it in her head
 that Kenehan has been

1022
01:24:38,366 --> 01:24:39,757
  bad mouthing her all around town.

1023
01:24:39,798 --> 01:24:43,184
He's got her down there right now
crying to the miners

1024
01:24:43,225 --> 01:24:47,795
and... he's got these
papers from Bluefield.

1025
01:24:54,236 --> 01:24:56,370
I didn't leave my Colt like this.

     What'd you hear, huh?

1028
01:25:12,854 --> 01:25:14,188
      What did you hear?
        - Nothin'.

1029
01:25:14,189 --> 01:25:16,190

01:25:25,133 --> 01:25:28,703
You know how I won this,
preacher boy, huh?

1032
01:25:29,804 --> 01:25:35,412
 I was sitting alone
in a ditch in France and this Kraut

1033
01:25:35,443 --> 01:25:37,714
     jumps in right next to me

1034
01:25:38,445 --> 01:25:40,684
    and I took my bayonet

1035
01:25:40,715 --> 01:25:45,219
  and I stuck him right in the face.

1036
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:49,142
And then another jumps in
and I stick him too.

1037
01:25:49,313 --> 01:25:51,659
And another, and another

1038
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:55,686
and another...
They just kept coming one at a time

1039

            all night long.

1040
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:02,003
  And, a little bit, I got to worried

1041
01:26:02,104 --> 01:26:04,238
      that they weren't all dead,

1042
01:26:04,339 --> 01:26:07,841
so I stuck them all again
a couple times just to make sure.

1043
01:26:09,544 --> 01:26:12,013
      And in the morning

1044
01:26:12,214 --> 01:26:15,048
they said that I was a war hero.

1045
01:26:17,786 --> 01:26:23,157
Well, I'm gonna stay
close to you tonight, preacher boy.

I'm going to do it with a
story from the Patriarchs.

1102
01:31:42,744 --> 01:31:45,465
Now, we all know about Joseph
and how out of all Jacob's

1103
01:31:45,498 --> 01:31:48,452
12 children he was the smartest
and the smoothest and how

1104
01:31:48,483 --> 01:31:51,308
 his brothers got so jealous they
pulled off his coat of many colors

1105
01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:53,888
 and whooped on him and left him out

1106

           to be sold into slavery.

1107
01:31:56,791 --> 01:31:59,926
But Joseph was not your ordinary
 fella even for biblical times,

1108
01:31:59,961 --> 01:32:01,528
 he had a special way with him.

 A way of looking at the
grand scheme of things.

1110
01:32:05,633 --> 01:32:08,105
So when this fella Potiphar
    bought him for a slave

1111
01:32:08,136 --> 01:32:12,109
Joseph just smiled and vowed
he was going to be a good one.

Making the best of a bad situation

1113
01:32:14,409 --> 01:32:17,311
he put his heart to his work and
 was honest and friendly in his dealings

1114
01:32:17,346 --> 01:32:20,003
and before you knew it
he was just about running

1115

 and all his business' for him.

wouldn't fight in the war,

1120
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:39,701
       it's against their religion.

1121
01:32:43,171 --> 01:32:46,473
It's also against their religion
to shave their beards or

1122
01:32:46,774 --> 01:32:50,544
 wear buttons on their clothes
and they was being forced

    So, they refused to work

right there in Hell's Half Acre.
