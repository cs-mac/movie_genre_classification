1
00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:01,668
Come on.
You gotta do it.

2
00:00:01,752 --> 00:00:06,256
No, I don't think so. Do
it. Come on. I need you.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:11,887
Barry, if I work for you, the
fun would go out it, you know?

4
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:15,891
There'd be a lot of tension. It
might even screw up our marriage.

5
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:20,395
Fuck our marriage. Come on.
This is important. I need you.

6
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:24,066
Don't you want the show to be as good
as it can be? Aren't you behind me?

7
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:28,445
You gotta be joking.
Of course I'm not joking.

8
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,906
You just said,
"Fuck our marriage."

9
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,494
I'm joking.

10
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:38,997
This is getting really boring.
I'm gonna switch it, all right?

11
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,794
I just thought that...

12
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,506
Forget it.

13
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,097
I'm very proud of you.

14
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,101
It's wonderful for you.

15
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,272
Come on. Okay?

16
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:07,860
Hmm?
Come on. Okay?

17
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:21,623
Barry?

18
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:24,168
Baby, I don't wanna go
in the sink.

19
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,461
Yeah! In the sink!

20
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:32,217
I don't wanna go
in the sink.

21
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:35,262
Oh-ho!
Hi, Ellen!

22
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,639
Hi, Stu.

23
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,642
Are you having a party?
Yeah, a sink party.

24
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:47,399
Oh, uh, hi, hon. My mother wasn't
feeling well, so I decided to come home.

25
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:51,612
Ellen, I thought you
and your mother were...

26
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,199
uh-
Eh...

27
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:58,994
Um, what...

28
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,163
what are you two up to?

29
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,877
Look, I better go out and
come back in. Barry, come back.

30
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:11,215
You cut me off!

31
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:15,469
Hey, Theresa, come here.
Come with Stuey,

32
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:20,349
and have a Stuey sandwich
with Mimi and Stuey.

33
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:34,696
You want one?

34
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:36,698
No.

35
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:59,596
He became a millionaire.
How about that?

36
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,890
Brings back memories.

37
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:05,978
A lot of changes. I'm
nicer, I make more money...

38
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:08,397
and I only hang up
on one out of seven.

39
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,110
...with Dallas' own Mr.
Popularity, Barry Champlaign.

40
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,655
I'm Sidney Greenberg, reminding
you that it's not how much you take,

41
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,700
it's how much
you take home.

42
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,702
Hey!

43
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,913
How's Chicago? You look great.
Great. You look great too.

44
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:26,957
Ellen, what are you
doing here?

45
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,585
I couldn't miss
Barry's premiere.

46
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,713
Yeah, we only have a couple of
minutes. You mind if I steal Barry?

47
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:35,591
You know where the green room is.
Have a cup of coffee. We'll catch up.

48
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,634
Sure. Bye.

49
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:46,643
Evening, Barry. I have
two minutes. What is it?

50
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:50,397
I'll make it brief. I know
you've got your show to do.

51
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,901
Barry, we've run into some
slight scheduling problems...

52
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,903
concerning
the national feed.

53
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:59,031
We're gonna have to delay it
for at least a couple of weeks.

54
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,874
Hi, Stuey.

55
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:12,628
Ellen! Holy cow!
I knew you'd show up.

56
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:17,966
Jesus, let me look at you here. Are
you taking young pills or something?

57
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,219
Wanna step into my crib
with me? You must be excited.

58
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,387
Oh, yeah, I'm jumping out
of my skin. You kidding me?

59
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:25,390
I called my mother and told her we're
gonna broadcast all over the country.

60
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:29,436
She says, "Stuart, that's
beautiful. What country?"

61
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,939
Good to see you.
It's good to see you.

62
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:35,150
Hi, I'm Laura Nicholson. I
spoke to you on the phone. Hi.

63
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,569
Oh, it's nice to meet you.
You must be Barry's secretary.

64
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:42,407
No, actually, I'm his producer. We're
going in a few seconds. Excuse me.

65
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:48,747
Let's go. From the heart
of the Lone Star state,

66
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,085
it's time for Dallas' most
popular talk show, Night Talk...

67
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:57,548
- with Barry Champlaign.
- # Bad to bone #

68
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:01,468
The KGAB phone lines are open
and ready for your call...

69
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:03,512
at 555-TALK.

70
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:08,225
Nice to meet you. Nice to
meet you. Isn't this exciting?

71
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,852
I've just received
some terrible news.

72
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:12,187
Night Talk will not be broadcast
nationally tonight...

73
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:15,148
due to the usual corporate,
big business, inefficiency,

74
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,067
sloppiness and bureaucracy.

75
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,319
I've just been informed
of a scheduling problem.

76
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:22,531
Nothing personal, nothing
logical, just business as usual.

77
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:27,035
Maybe the show will go national
next week, maybe next month.

78
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:29,496
No one seems to know.
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,583
I feel I've let you,
the listeners, down.

80
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,543
But I've been in this business long
enough to know you can lose the battle...

81
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,545
and still win the war.

82
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:41,091
Night Talk still has a purpose,
a standard to which it must rise,

83
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,760
and I will not let you down
on that score.

84
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:47,055
This show is about saying
what's got to be said.

85
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,141
That's what
we're gonna do here tonight.

86
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:51,393
Tonight, anything goes.

87
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:55,230
I wanna hear you. I want you to
tell me what you really think.

88
00:05:55,314 --> 00:06:00,235
No holds barred. Call
555- TALK. I'm sorry.

89
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:05,699
The door is open.
Hit me with your best shot.

90
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,412
Night Talk.
Jerry from Rockwell.

91
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,457
You're on.
Barry.

92
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,126
Have you ever entertained
one single doubt...

93
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,128
about the truth
of the Holocaust?

94
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:28,805
I think we've had
this conversation before, sir.

95
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,351
When you make these accusations against Jews,
when you start questioning the Holocaust,

96
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:35,771
I think you should have some facts
available, and the facts are available.

97
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:39,107
Well, of course. We'd love to
sit down and debate them with you.

98
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:41,610
Uh-huh. Well, who's "we"? Am
I talking to a "we" or a "you"?

99
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:44,071
Well, Barry, we're
organized in our belief...

100
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:47,199
the same way the Zionists
are organized in their belief.

101
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:50,244
We could debate it. It would
be very easy and simple.

102
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,829
It would be far more simple and
valuable for you to get in touch with,

103
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,040
let's say, the Holocaust
Museum down in Washington.

104
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,042
Uh-huh. They'll send you
the names of all the Jews...

105
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,044
who died during World War ll.

106
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,673
They have all this information. I mean, the
first one to say if somebody made a mistake...

107
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:06,635
They say six million died? It could've
been five million or seven million.

108
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:09,054
It could be two also.

109
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:12,808
Is that the issue? That two
million innocent people died?

110
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:16,353
Why should one single innocent
person die, Jew or non- Jew? I agree.

111
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:21,066
But the Zionists are using this issue
and the guilt on the American public...

112
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,068
to extort from us
our tax dollars.

113
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,071
The figures we have say
every family in Israel...

114
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,199
gets over$10, 000
of our taxes.

115
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:31,785
Well, you'll never see more
collective poverty than in Israel.

116
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:35,122
I urge you to take a trip there. All you
got to do, Barry, is go to West Virginia.

117
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:38,083
What does West Virginia have to
do with it? Or Nebraska or Idaho,

118
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:41,003
where you'll see farmer after
farmer biting the dust, Mm-hmm.

119
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,297
losing their farms, can't
get decent loans. Yeah.

120
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,674
If we had the loans and grants
that are sent to Israel,

121
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:49,219
we wouldn't be losing our farms,
which is the backbone of this country.

122
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:52,514
And what if a woman competes with you
in the marketplace and takes your job?

123
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:55,684
What if black men start dating
and marrying white women? Oh!

124
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:57,686
And what if homosexuals
are teaching your children?

125
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:59,688
And what if you're afraid
to walk the streets at night?

126
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,608
What if you see yuppies getting rich while
you're standing in the unemployment line?

127
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:05,527
And what if your government
sends you to Vietnam...

128
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:08,030
to fight a war they have
no chance of winning?

129
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:11,200
And what if your country
is slipping away, lost?

130
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,243
I know the argument, friend.

131
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:16,872
It's the great theory of
history. I've heard it before.

132
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,916
It says,
"When things ain't good,

133
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,126
"instead of getting down
and doing something about it,

134
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,630
instead of changing your life, it's a hell
of a lot easier to blame somebody else."

135
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,632
And it just don't wash
in my book.

136
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:29,176
Well, that's a very nice
speech, Barry, Mm-hmm.

137
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:32,721
but it seems to me you're making
pretty good money on that station.

138
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:35,057
And since you're an outsider
to these parts and all,

139
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,976
it seems difficult, I guess, to relate
to the common-folk problems out here.

140
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,104
There is no room for self-pity,
sir, in my life or yours.

141
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:45,150
Now, you ought to read the Turner Diaries,
Barry, by William Pierce. It's all there.

142
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,152
Mm-hmm.
It says...

143
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:49,363
Yes, I'm familiar with that novel
- a product of the enlightened man.

144
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:52,699
Now, let me finish!
Barry, I got Beauty on five.

145
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:55,786
What it does is lays out the plan
for the coming revolution. Mm- hmm.

146
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:59,832
See, the word "America, "Barry, means
"heavenly kingdom" in the gothic language.

147
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:02,251
Yeah. It's the real new
Jerusalem of Scripture.

148
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,837
It shows you how the Jews
are impostors who took...

149
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,214
Yeah, yeah, yeah. For those
of you who don't know it,

150
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:11,677
it starts idiotically enough in
the year 1991. That's correct.

151
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,806
It's written as a diary by a young,
white, racist, electrical engineer...

152
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,809
who joins an underground
paramilitary organization...

153
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,228
known as "The Order."
That's right.

154
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,272
Oh, am I doing all right?
Oh, great.

155
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,649
They institute a revolution
against ZOG,

156
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,944
the Zionist Occupied Government
of America.

157
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:32,155
And along the way, they kill
all the mongrel races...

158
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:35,158
Jews, blacks,
homosexuals, feminists...

159
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,536
and other mud people.

160
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:40,247
It's an idiotic book written for
people with bubble gum brains...

161
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,749
who never got out of the fourth
grade, watching reruns of The Blob.

162
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,544
Easy, Barry.
You're part of the problem.

163
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,713
You're another Jew,
another weed-eating Jew,

164
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,715
in control of the media
of this country.

165
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:53,510
And from there, you pass judgement
on that which you don't know.

166
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:57,222
And there will come a day for you,
Barry, and thousands of others like you...

167
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,892
who have slept with black women,
who have lied to us...

168
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:03,145
when you will hang from your neck
with a placard around it saying,

169
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:06,148
"I betrayed my race. "

170
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:12,446
Well, what can you say to
a paranoid schizophrenic...

171
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,532
who's a coward for hanging up, except
that I guess the day that I hang,

172
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:18,243
I'll probably defend the asshole
who hung me.

173
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:22,581
Talk radio. Free speech
isn't really free at all.

174
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:26,126
It's actually a little bit like Russian
roulette. A very expensive commodity.

175
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,670
You never know what's gonna come up
the next time you push the button.

176
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:31,089
Yeah, you're on Night Talk.
I changed my name...

177
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:34,134
and didn't have any trouble
getting Social Security.

178
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:37,513
My birth certificate has
my name spelled differently.

179
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,765
And I-
Hello?

180
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:43,519
Yeah, it's very interesting.
What's your view on lesbian priests?

181
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:46,188
My view on what?
How about masturbation?

182
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,315
You got any view on that?
No, I don't.

183
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:51,443
How about that law in Arizona
where it's a felony...

184
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:53,487
to go around with
an erection in your pants?

185
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,990
What do you think about that? Well,
I-I'm not really calling about that.

186
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:58,825
Mm-hmm. If they wanna
do it, let 'em do it.

187
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,827
Yeah, what?

188
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:02,871
Kent's on three. I don't
think you should take the call.

189
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:05,541
Lose him, Barry.
Barry? Hello?

190
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:08,710
Yeah, yeah. Well, that's just fine
for you. Tell him to shoot it to me.

191
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:11,046
Hello, Barry? Hello?
Well, good, good.

192
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,340
That's good for you.

193
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,551
Gee, tonight's just
a walk down memory lane.

194
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:17,886
And we have Kent with us
once again.

195
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:21,181
Yeah, Kent. I didn't
mean to hang up on you.

196
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:24,768
Yeah, but you did. Listen, Kent,
you're a fake. You're a hoax.

197
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:27,354
You call up with some fake-o story
about how you and your girlfriend...

198
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,690
are taking drugs
and she's O.D.'d...

199
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,859
and your parents are in Acapulco. Fiji.

200
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:33,861
Oh, Fiji, right.
An important detail.

201
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:36,280
You're just this poor, mixed-up
kid. You don't know what to do.

202
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:40,325
I think she's dead!
What are you trying to tell me?

203
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:43,245
That your girlfriend O.D.'d? Now
she's dead? I don't know, okay?

204
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:47,583
I just can't get her to wake
up! Yeah, we heard that already.

205
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,668
There's foam coming
out of her mouth. What?

206
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:52,004
Foam coming out of her mouth.

207
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:55,257
Let's dump this guy, now.
It's Barry's show, boss.

208
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:57,259
That's it. That's it.
Listen!

209
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:59,511
My parents are in Fiji,
okay?

210
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:02,890
And the stuff about my girlfriend
- Yeah, what?

211
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:05,058
She
- Come on, Kent. Spit it out.

212
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:08,395
No, you'll cut me off!
I won't cut you off, Kent.

213
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:11,273
You promise?

214
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:14,443
I promise I won't
cut you off, Kent.

215
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:20,616
I made the whole thing up!

216
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,542
Kent? I lied. I'm cutting you off. What?

217
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:33,212
Get the hell out of here. No,
please! Look, I'm not Iying!

218
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:35,255
I gotta talk to you.
You gotta talk to me?

219
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,716
What are you gonna talk about?
Your mother just slit her wrists?

220
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,718
She's bleeding to death?

221
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,554
How about your father? Got a shotgun
in his mouth? Gonna blow his brains out?

222
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:45,098
Tell me, who else is dead?
Come on. Who's dead, Kent?

223
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:47,392
Who's dead? Who's dead?
Tell me, who's dead?

224
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:49,645
No one's dead!
No one's dead, Barry.

225
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,688
Come on. Look.

226
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,316
I just wanted to talk. We're
talking. You got two seconds. Talk.

227
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:57,194
Okay, I listen to you all
the time, you know. Mm- hmm.

228
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,988
I think about what you say, Bar. Yeah.

229
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:02,783
You say such cool stuff.
Mm-hmm.

230
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:05,702
Well, I just didn't know
what to say, you know.

231
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:09,665
Look, I wanted to meet you.

232
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,792
Now you're goofing on me.
You wanted to meet me?

233
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:15,128
You can meet me anytime you want.
I'm right here in the station.

234
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:17,673
You're at the station? I'm not
the president, for God's sakes.

235
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,008
I'm right here, downtown,
in the studio.

236
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,803
So I could just come down?
You could just come down.

237
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:25,305
Now? Right now?
Now.

238
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,017
What do you mean, right now? Right now.

239
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:32,813
I'll just come down.
I'm on the air, Kent.

240
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:36,066
Please?

241
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:39,903
Sure, Kent. Why not?
Come on down. Really?

242
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:41,905
I'd love to meet you.
Just hurry up. Allright!

243
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:44,366
I'm halfway through the show. We're
at the end of the first hour...

244
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:47,327
of exciting and intellectual
conversation here on Night Talk.

245
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:49,538
Don't go away. We have the
news and the weather coming up.

246
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:52,040
And then we'll be back
with more Night Talk.

247
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:56,044
Barry.
Dan.

248
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:58,172
Laura, call down and tell
Security there's a kid coming.

249
00:13:58,255 --> 00:14:00,674
Dan, you want anything?
Coffee? Tea? Insulin?

250
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,676
Crack?
We have it all right here.

251
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,220
Barry, you should ask me if you
wanna have a guest on the show.

252
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:07,890
Why? 'Cause I'm the
boss, Barry. That's why.

253
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:10,225
Dan, I'll do my job,
you do yours, okay?

254
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:12,352
He is not coming on the show.
That's it. We have too much riding...

255
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:15,272
on what's going on here tonight.
What's going on here tonight?

256
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:18,692
If they think for one minute that
you're undependable, it's over.

257
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:21,111
Dan, Metro Wave bought my show.
All right?

258
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:23,989
This is my show.
I put who I want on my show.

259
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,700
If I wanna have Charlie Manson on
my show, I'll put him on the show.

260
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,661
Or Ted Bundy
- Or how about this. I have David Berkowitz,

261
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:31,705
Bernard Goetz,
John Hinckley on.

262
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:34,374
We do a special on gun
control. How would that be?

263
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,419
Or how about that postman from
Oklahoma who killed 14 people, Dan?

264
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:40,255
He killed his boss. We
bring him on the show. Cut.

265
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:42,341
We bring you on as a
special guest. Out. Out.

266
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:44,885
We're gonna bring these guys on the
show. We'll have a terrific show.

267
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:47,095
Oh, boy, this'll be great.

268
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:50,015
That's funny stuff, Barry,
the mailman who killed his boss.

269
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,768
Did you see what the mailman
brought me today?

270
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,937
Huh?

271
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:57,606
We got half the wackos
within 20 miles of this place...

272
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:00,484
saying how much they wanna
"burn your Jew ass."

273
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:04,488
Think about that, Barry. The time it
takes to sit down and write that on paper,

274
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,907
put it in an envelope, lick
it, send it to the station.

275
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,451
And I've got boxes
of this shit in my office.

276
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:12,621
These people
are dead serious.

277
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:16,124
All I'm suggesting is that you simply
pull it back, just for a little bit.

278
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,126
I think you're a little
out of your depth, Dan.

279
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,547
I think it's time
- Just stop talking and listen to me for two minutes!

280
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,549
You don't have an audience
in here now to cheer you on.

281
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:27,469
You do whatever you want to tonight,
Barry. Have fun. Blow the deal.

282
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:30,013
I'm not gonna say I don't care,
because I worked very hard on this.

283
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:33,517
- I worked my ass off on this.
- This is my life you're talking about.

284
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,397
No, what you are, Barry, is a fucking
suit salesman with a big mouth.

285
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,816
Let's call a spade a spade.

286
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:43,026
It's a job.
That's all it is.

287
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,612
You can come in here and start predicting
Armageddon if you want to, Barry.

288
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:47,656
But it's still a job.

289
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:50,492
A job you did not even know
how to do...

290
00:15:50,534 --> 00:15:52,536
until I taught it to you!

291
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,455
What do you think you're doing
in here, changing the world?

292
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:59,501
This is a talk show, Barry,
and you are a talk show host.

293
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:02,671
Alan does the drive time, Jerry
does the home handyman stuff,

294
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:06,675
Sheila does the shrink stuff, Sid does the
financial stuff, and you hang up on people.

295
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:08,886
That's your job.

296
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:11,054
Now, you're very good at it.
You're the joker in my deck,

297
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:13,432
and I'm very happy
for your success.

298
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:15,434
But you work for me!

299
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,436
I'm your boss.

300
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:22,482
You wanna have the kid
on the show? Have him on!

301
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:25,652
But you get one thing straight.
You fuck up my deal,

302
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:28,447
and you go back to selling
double-knit suits.

303
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,629
I'm glad you take it
all so seriously, Barry,

304
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:46,465
but you gotta learn when to stop
or it's gonna kill you.

305
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:54,932
Go get the kid. The kid
is not a good idea, Barry.

306
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,726
You're on his side, aren't you? No,
I want you to think about the show.

307
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:02,397
You could lose everything that you've
worked for and everything I've worked for.

308
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:04,525
Get the kid.

309
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:06,693
It's very important to Barry.

310
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:08,737
It's a very important moment
in his life.

311
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,698
Yes, he is important to me.
He is important.

312
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:17,246
Look, Lou,
he's a fuckin' basket case.

313
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:20,082
Lou- Allright, allright.
Forget it. Forget it.

314
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:23,794
I'll just stay to see the show tonight,
and then I'll be home tomorrow, okay?

315
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:26,088
Love you.

316
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:28,549
Yeah. Hey.

317
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:30,926
Just pretend I'm visiting
a sick relative.

318
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,011
All right?

319
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:35,472
Bye.

320
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:37,474
Yeah.

321
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:47,484
Night Talk. We're back. This is
the spirit of Barry Champlaign.

322
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:50,362
Joe, hit me with your
best shot. Yeah, Barry.

323
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:52,823
I've been driving a cab now
for about 11 years.

324
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:55,993
I've met all kinds. I
know people. I wish I did.

325
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,995
Let me tell you
something, friend.

326
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:01,874
That kid who just called, what he
needs is a good bust in the chops.

327
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:05,294
Think that would do it, Joe? Kid
like that needs some discipline.

328
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:08,505
Discipline?
I got two kids, Barry.

329
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:11,592
They give me any trouble,
I just take off my belt.

330
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:13,969
They see the belt,
that's it.

331
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:18,932
How old are your children, Joe? Little
girl's five, boy's three and a half.

332
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:23,979
You hit them with a belt?
Brush, belt, newspaper. Whatever.

333
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:27,816
Hey, they're either gonna get it from
me or they're gonna get it out there.

334
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,819
Joe, I think you need
professional help. What's that?

335
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:32,821
You need to get together with
Jerry. He can hold them down...

336
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:35,157
while you hit them with a belt.
What the hell are you talking about?

337
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,659
You're hitting your kids with
brushes and belts. You're psychotic.

338
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:41,330
You're a psycho. Yeah? And
what are you, friend, a faggot?

339
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:44,500
Coming from a pinhead like you,
that's a complement.

340
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:48,128
How about I come on down there to
that station of yours right now...

341
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:51,048
and bust your little
faggot face right in?

342
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,509
Who's gonna help, your brother? You
don't say nothin' about my brother.

343
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,094
Your brother hangs around Harry
Heinz Blvd., doesn't he? He's a pimp.

344
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:58,222
And your wife, she's a
hooker, isn't she? My wife?

345
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:01,058
What do you beat her with,
a baseball bat?

346
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,060
Hmm?

347
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:08,023
Well, I know where
you live, partner.

348
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:11,151
Allright?
I know what you look like.

349
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:14,988
Mm-hmm.
Sweet dreams, sweetheart.

350
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:18,992
I can't wait.

351
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:22,371
Vincent, you're on Night Talk.
Say something interesting.

352
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:25,207
Yeah. Uh-
Yeah.

353
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,669
I've been listening to
you for five years. Uh-huh.

354
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:31,547
Yup, and the guys down here at
the store put you on every night.

355
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,007
Yup. And we sit around
and laugh at you...

356
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:36,385
Yup. because you're
such a jerk-off and...

357
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:38,762
Yeah, all right.
Night Talk. Agnes, yeah.

358
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:41,890
Barry, can I ask you a question? Hit me.

359
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:46,144
I wouldn't hit you
for the world, sweetheart.

360
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:49,940
I Love Lucy. Now, why don't
they make more of them? What?

361
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,901
What do you want to talk
to Barry about?

362
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:55,404
You wanna rape somebody?

363
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:58,991
Why don't you go home and take
a cold shower. That'd be better.

364
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:02,244
Those shows are ancient, Agnes. Lucille
Ball must be at least 105 years old.

365
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:05,372
The rest of the cast is dead.
No. Now, she's not that old.

366
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:08,750
I saw her on the show the other
night, and she looked to be around 35.

367
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:11,920
And that Ricky Ricardo,
boy, can he play the bongos.

368
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:14,673
Nobody can be this stupid. Are you
serious, Agnes? You know what year this is?

369
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:17,467
Yeah, John,
you're on Night Talk.

370
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:19,469
Remember me, Barry?

371
00:20:19,553 --> 00:20:22,097
I called and said
I was in Turtle Creek.

372
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:24,558
Well, I...

373
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:27,394
I raped three women since then.

374
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:32,524
Do you remember me? I'm
not sure. Refresh me, John.

375
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:36,236
I'm thinking about raping another
one, Barry. I saw her this morning.

376
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,907
What are you doing to me, Stu? You're
killing me right here on the air.

377
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,494
- Oh, could we relax, please?
- These women I raped aren't turning me in.

378
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:45,954
How come? Well, tell
me where you are, John,

379
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:48,373
and I'll make sure
you get some help.

380
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:51,460
You have my word on that. I'm
just so tired of raping women. I...

381
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:54,713
I'm so tired
of raping women!

382
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:59,301
I
- I got rage for them! I got rage for them! John.

383
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:01,470
When was the last time
you raped a woman?

384
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:05,849
In Greenville
a couple weeks ago.

385
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:08,560
She was-
She was struttin' around...

386
00:21:08,644 --> 00:21:11,230
like she was something else.

387
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:15,317
Yeah, I-I understand, John.
I sympathize.

388
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:17,319
We all get angry.

389
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:20,322
Where did the rape
actually occur?

390
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:23,534
It was in the backseat
of her car.

391
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:25,953
She pulled into
the Jack in the Box parking lot.

392
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:29,331
I jumped in and said,
"Okay, I'm-"

393
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:33,252
It was nighttime, sometime.
I don't know.

394
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:39,049
How old are you, John?
I'm 40.

395
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,677
I was in the pen 12 years.
Are you taping this for me?

396
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,889
I didn't get no therapy. They didn't
do nothin' for me! Let me hook this up.

397
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:49,810
They didn't- They didn't-
They didn't bother to help me!

398
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:54,690
Barry, I'm gonna rape somebody.
I'm gonna do it. But why?

399
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:57,693
I gotta!
It's an irresistible compulsion.

400
00:21:57,776 --> 00:22:00,863
It's like- It's like
tryin' to quit smoking.

401
00:22:00,946 --> 00:22:03,782
Barry, I can't help myself.

402
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:05,868
I can't...

403
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:08,996
Yeah, all right. You have
this irresistible compulsion.

404
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:12,082
John, the last time we spoke,

405
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,543
you said that
jogging helped you.

406
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:17,296
Up and down Turtle Creek.

407
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:20,132
Jogging up and down the
Turtle Creek. Turtle Creek!

408
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:24,845
I could name you every duck
in Turtle Creek!

409
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:29,224
John, have you decided
who you're gonna rape next?

410
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:33,478
I got her picked out,
staked out and ready.

411
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:36,940
I always wanted her.

412
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:40,569
What is it about her
that you like?

413
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:46,408
What is it about a piece of strawberry
pie or a piece of pumpkin pie?

414
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:49,828
I mean, I don't know.
She could be black or white,

415
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:53,874
Hispano, Japanese,
pretty, fat, ugly.

416
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,795
I wanna rape them all!

417
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:02,841
All right, John, calm down. I
wanna help you. I'm your friend.

418
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:06,929
Are you my buddy, Barry?

419
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:10,766
I'm your buddy, John.

420
00:23:12,351 --> 00:23:14,937
I can't help myself.
I gotta go do it.

421
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:18,732
You can help yourself. You're not
gonna do it, John. No, I gotta do it.

422
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:20,943
No, you're not
gonna do it, John.

423
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:23,529
Now, listen to me.
I'm gonna go do it.

424
00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:26,448
No, no, no. Think about
what you're saying, John.

425
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:31,161
John?

426
00:23:31,245 --> 00:23:33,163
He's gone.

427
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:47,135
Another lost soul
goes into the Dallas night.

428
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:53,559
We-We have a police trace
on this.

429
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:55,894
If anybody knows
anything about this man...

430
00:23:55,978 --> 00:24:00,107
or is in Turtle Creek or
sees someone in a phone booth,

431
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,192
please call us here
at KGAB.

432
00:24:02,276 --> 00:24:06,864
The number to call is,
is 555-TALK.

433
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:12,953
Uh, let's hear
from our sponsors...

434
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:15,497
Pasty Mate Roach
and Termite Cleaners.

435
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:18,041
Listen closely.

436
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:20,794
The sound
of cockroaches mating...

437
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:24,673
enhanced 500 times.
They couldn't trace it.

438
00:24:24,715 --> 00:24:26,925
Right, I should've kept him on
for another three hours.

439
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:30,179
You know, I once had
a cup of Humphrey's coffee.

440
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:32,306
I was spitting blood
for three weeks.

441
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:34,975
You should try
the decaffeinated, Barry.

442
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:39,688
This is great.
Oh, wait. Don't tell me.

443
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,690
He seems
pretty harmless.

444
00:24:41,732 --> 00:24:43,817
Come on, kid, sit down.
This is your chair.

445
00:24:43,901 --> 00:24:45,861
This is your microphone.
Speak directly into it.

446
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:47,863
Keep your mouth about
six inches away from it.

447
00:24:47,905 --> 00:24:52,284
These are your headphones so you can
hear the show. These are the ground rules.

448
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:54,286
What?
The ground rules.

449
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:57,206
No last names, no brand names,
no phone numbers over the air.

450
00:24:57,247 --> 00:25:01,210
Other than that, act and speak
normally. This is Mr. Barry Champlaign.

451
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:04,713
You're Barry.

452
00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:07,174
You got him.
All right.

453
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:09,384
What's wrong with him?
He's star struck.

454
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:11,762
Hey, kid, say something. I need
a level. Check, check. Check one.

455
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:14,056
Here we go on five,

456
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:17,976
four, three, two, one.
Stu.

457
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:22,231
Strap in, bitch.
Here we go.

458
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:25,484
We're back. I'm Barry Champlaign.
You're listening to Night Talk.

459
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:28,028
We have a very special guest
with us tonight.

460
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:30,072
Kent. Say hello
to everybody, Kent.

461
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:32,199
All right.

462
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:34,743
My sentiments exactly.

463
00:25:34,827 --> 00:25:38,831
We've brought Kent on board to get an
inside look at the future of America.

464
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:41,166
Kent is the classic
American youth...

465
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:45,587
energetic and resourceful,
spoiled, perverse and disturbed.

466
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:48,423
Would you say that's an accurate
description, Kent? Yep, sure.

467
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:52,511
What do you call that haircut?
I don't know. Rock and roll!

468
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:55,264
Are you high right now,
Kent?

469
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:58,517
Am I high?
Are you on drugs,

470
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,103
or is this your naturally
moronic self?

471
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:07,359
Watch the drool. You're
getting it all over the console.

472
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:14,408
I can't believe
I'm here, man.

473
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,371
Hey. Wow. Does this thing really work?

474
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:22,124
You're sitting in
a radio station, Kent.

475
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:24,126
You're sitting in front
of a live mike.

476
00:26:24,168 --> 00:26:26,128
When you speak, thousands
of people hear your voice.

477
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,797
It penetrates their minds.

478
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:35,888
Okay, okay.
No, listen.

479
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:39,808
I wanna send that one out to Diamond
Dave and Billy the bass player...

480
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:43,395
and all the babes
at the Valley View Mall.

481
00:26:46,857 --> 00:26:49,443
We're discussing
America here tonight, Kent.

482
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:51,445
Do you have any thoughts
on that subject?

483
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:54,656
Yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry.

484
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,451
I broke your train of thought. Please,
keep going. This is exhilarating.

485
00:26:57,534 --> 00:26:59,620
No, I know.

486
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:02,080
It's not like I'm not political
or nothin'. You know, I mean...

487
00:27:02,164 --> 00:27:05,584
I like Bruce.
He's political.

488
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:08,587
Bruce Springsteen, yes.
A very deep, political thinker.

489
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,089
He's a communist, isn't he?

490
00:27:11,173 --> 00:27:13,091
No, he's from New Jersey.

491
00:27:13,175 --> 00:27:16,803
His ex is pretty nice.
Mm-hmm. Whose ex?

492
00:27:16,887 --> 00:27:19,473
Bruce's. Bruce Springsteen's
wife. Yes, what about her?

493
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:21,683
Julienne.
Hi, Julienne.

494
00:27:22,768 --> 00:27:25,312
She was a model.
You know that, Bar?

495
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:27,689
All those guys
got models, Bar.

496
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:31,693
I mean, Mick and Jerry,
Keith and Patty,

497
00:27:31,777 --> 00:27:34,321
Prince and...

498
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:38,033
Prince.

499
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:40,035
You know, Bar,
Bingo.

500
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:42,037
models only hang around with
guys they think are coolest.

501
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,166
Look at you, man. You're a
big guy, famous star and all.

502
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:49,419
I mean, you got that fine babe
right over there...

503
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:51,672
who works for you, man.

504
00:27:54,758 --> 00:27:58,220
So hey, if you got some
cash and you're cool,

505
00:27:58,303 --> 00:28:00,639
you get to have a model.

506
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:03,392
So you wouldn't call yourself a
women's libber then, Kent, huh?

507
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:06,645
Yeah, I would, Bar. I mean,
everybody being liberated, you know.

508
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:09,690
Women, South Africans, all
those kind of people, you know.

509
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:12,025
I saw a show
about all that stuff...

510
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:15,320
about how revolution's
a pretty important thing.

511
00:28:15,404 --> 00:28:19,783
We're gonna have a lot more
revolutions where people get together,

512
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:22,744
solidarity and that
and...

513
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:24,872
You know,
like that song by Megadeath.

514
00:28:24,955 --> 00:28:26,915
# Peace sells
but who's buying #

515
00:28:26,957 --> 00:28:30,252
# Peace sells but who's
buying # Ah, come on!

516
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:35,465
Hey, plus-
Oh, I saw this other show...

517
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:37,926
about how in the future they're
gonna have these two-way TV sets.

518
00:28:37,968 --> 00:28:40,220
People will be able to see
each other and everything.

519
00:28:40,262 --> 00:28:43,932
And then there's, like, no way they're
gonna be able to stop the revolution.

520
00:28:45,976 --> 00:28:48,061
Who won't be able
to stop it, Kent?

521
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:52,733
Big Brother, the government,
corporations.

522
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:55,736
They're a bunch of fascists. They
wanna control everybody's mind.

523
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:58,739
But, hey, freedom's
an important thing,

524
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:01,158
just like you
always say, Bar.

525
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:04,578
You say
the best things, Bar.

526
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:06,622
I listen to you
all the time.

527
00:29:06,705 --> 00:29:08,665
You're great.
Kent, you're an idiot.

528
00:29:08,749 --> 00:29:10,918
I sincerely hope you do not
represent the future of this country,

529
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:12,920
because if you do
we are in sad shape.

530
00:29:28,018 --> 00:29:30,979
Bar, man,
you're so funny, man.

531
00:29:31,063 --> 00:29:35,108
That's why I love to listen to your show.
That's why all the kids listen to you, man.

532
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,110
Plus, these goons
push you around, you know.

533
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,112
All the kids
listen to you, Bar.

534
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:41,657
You are the best thing
on the radio!

535
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,285
Kent, we discuss a lot of
serious subjects on this show...

536
00:29:45,327 --> 00:29:48,956
sad things, frightening
things, tragic things.

537
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:52,709
Doesn't any of that
bother you?

538
00:29:52,793 --> 00:29:55,504
Nope.

539
00:29:55,546 --> 00:29:57,798
Why not?

540
00:29:59,258 --> 00:30:01,969
It's just a show. It's one
big rock video, huh, Kent?

541
00:30:02,052 --> 00:30:04,346
Yeah!

542
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:11,687
No.
Come on, Bar.

543
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:16,817
It's your show.

544
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,323
Yeah, that it is, that it is.
It's my show.

545
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:25,868
Let's go back to the callers
on my show.

546
00:30:25,951 --> 00:30:28,495
Uh, Julia,
you're on Night Talk.

547
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:30,539
Barry, hello.
Now, you know, darlin',

548
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:32,541
I think these people who've
been callin' you tonight...

549
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:34,543
are a bunch of
I don't know what's.

550
00:30:34,585 --> 00:30:39,131
It's crazy. And that crazy kid you
got on there, now, that's terrible.

551
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:43,677
I've been listenin' to your show
for five years straight, Barry,

552
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,846
and I love you and your show.

553
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:49,224
I think it's terrific that more
folks are gonna be listenin'.

554
00:30:49,308 --> 00:30:52,686
I just hope you have time for
your longtime friends there, Bar.

555
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:54,980
I always have time
for my friends, Julia.

556
00:30:55,063 --> 00:30:57,024
Aw, you're terrific.

557
00:30:57,107 --> 00:31:00,319
Your show's terrific.
I don't know what else to say.

558
00:31:00,402 --> 00:31:03,322
Well, tell me something, Julia,
since you listen all the time.

559
00:31:03,405 --> 00:31:05,324
What is it
you like about the show?

560
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:08,285
Well, I don't know.

561
00:31:08,368 --> 00:31:10,662
A lot of things.

562
00:31:10,746 --> 00:31:14,416
Well, what, for instance?
Well, I love you, Bar.

563
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:16,835
Uh-huh, that's a given. Okay,
what about me do you love?

564
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:19,963
Well, you're very funny.
Uh-huh.

565
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:23,675
And I love to hear you talk about
all the things you have to say.

566
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:27,095
Yeah, yeah, okay.
Let's get back to the show.

567
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:29,097
The show must serve
some kind of purpose for you.

568
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:31,892
Well, now, I wouldn't say that.
What would you say?

569
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:34,061
Well, I don't know. What
do you mean, you don't know?

570
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,063
You said that at least five times
already. What don't you know?

571
00:31:36,146 --> 00:31:38,232
You've been listening to this show for five
years. You don't know why you listen to it?

572
00:31:38,273 --> 00:31:40,234
Well, I just said-
I heard what you just said.

573
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:43,111
You said you don't know why you listen
to this show. Why don't I tell you why.

574
00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:45,531
You listen so that you can feel
superior to the other losers who call in!

575
00:31:45,614 --> 00:31:47,533
Barry!
Don't "Barry" me!

576
00:31:47,616 --> 00:31:50,577
You've got sawdust between your ears
instead of brains. Just listen to you!

577
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:52,996
If I sounded as stupid as you, I'd
be too embarrassed to open my mouth!

578
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,791
I'm hanging up!
Good, and don't call back.

579
00:31:57,376 --> 00:31:59,294
Nothing more boring
than people who love you.

580
00:31:59,753 --> 00:32:01,296
Yeah, you're on Night Talk.

581
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,091
I just have one thing
to ask you, Barry.

582
00:32:04,174 --> 00:32:06,093
Hit me.

583
00:32:06,176 --> 00:32:09,805
Are you as ugly-looking
as you sound? Uglier.

584
00:32:09,847 --> 00:32:13,350
Yeah, I thought
you'd say something like that.

585
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:17,020
But as usual,
you avoid the question.

586
00:32:18,564 --> 00:32:22,067
What's the question?
I think you know the question.

587
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:28,031
Is an animal a vegetable or a
mineral? The question is obvious.

588
00:32:28,115 --> 00:32:30,659
Why does an intelligent fellow
like yourself...

589
00:32:30,742 --> 00:32:35,914
spend so much energy
hurting other people?

590
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:38,417
Hmm?
Do you not love yourself?

591
00:32:41,587 --> 00:32:44,506
I think you're very
lonely, Barry.

592
00:32:44,548 --> 00:32:48,677
I'm sorry for you, because
you don't know how to love.

593
00:32:51,889 --> 00:32:54,433
Night Talk. Ralph.

594
00:32:55,684 --> 00:32:58,020
They always say that,
don't they?

595
00:32:59,897 --> 00:33:03,442
"Why are you so angry"?

596
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:05,986
Well, they don't understand
me and you, Barry.

597
00:33:06,069 --> 00:33:09,156
We're the kind of people,
we feel too much.

598
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:11,158
Are we, Ralph?

599
00:33:13,243 --> 00:33:16,038
Yeah, my name is Cheryl Ann.
I'll hold.

600
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:20,959
Who knows? I mean,
take, for instance, cancer.

601
00:33:21,043 --> 00:33:23,712
What is cancer?
What are you doing, Ellen?

602
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:28,884
He's all alone out there.
So what?

603
00:33:32,888 --> 00:33:34,806
He's going down in flames,
Dan.

604
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:38,977
It's Barry's show,
Ellen.

605
00:33:39,061 --> 00:33:41,939
Let Barry
do Barry's show.

606
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:45,025
Well, what are they gonna do
with my TV set?

607
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:47,361
We watch it. That's what
people do with TV sets.

608
00:33:47,402 --> 00:33:51,740
What do they see? They see people
killing people, babies starving, floods.

609
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:53,742
And for what?
For nothing!

610
00:33:53,784 --> 00:33:56,578
For beer commercials
and Tampax ads,

611
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,081
MTV, a yacht, the ocean,

612
00:33:59,122 --> 00:34:01,083
a diamond earring,
a racehorse.

613
00:34:01,124 --> 00:34:04,044
Well, I guess so.

614
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:07,756
I guess so. All I know is
what I read in the papers.

615
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,886
And that's a lot of talk. Barry,
it's talk. Talk, talk, talk.

616
00:34:12,928 --> 00:34:15,055
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk,
talk, talk! Ralph, Ralph, Ralph!

617
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:17,808
Tell me something.
I'm curious.

618
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:20,269
How do you dial a phone
with a straightjacket on?

619
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,771
Barry.

620
00:34:22,813 --> 00:34:25,399
I don't know much about God
and I never was very religious,

621
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,070
but you can't help feeling
like something is wrong,

622
00:34:30,154 --> 00:34:33,949
like nobody's
driving the train,

623
00:34:35,033 --> 00:34:37,744
the system,

624
00:34:37,786 --> 00:34:40,122
'cause too many people
are gettin' sick.

625
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:45,335
And the traffic,
it's just jamming up.

626
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:50,716
And even the weather,
not so good lately.

627
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:55,262
Barry, I just don't
- I don't get it, Barry. I just don't get it.

628
00:34:55,345 --> 00:34:58,557
You don't get it, wimp? Here's
what you get! You get $1.59,

629
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,393
That's it. go down to the drugstore,
buy a pack of razor blades,

630
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:04,646
and slash your
fuckin' wrists, pinhead!

631
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:08,734
That's it, kid.
Come on.

632
00:35:08,817 --> 00:35:10,402
What?
Get him out of here, now!

633
00:35:15,657 --> 00:35:17,910
Hey, Barry!

634
00:35:21,872 --> 00:35:24,166
Get the fuck off me,
you fuckin' son of a bitch!

635
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:26,293
Thank you, Dallas!
Good night!

636
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:28,295
You allright, Barry?
Standby.

637
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:34,218
I'm confused, Barry.

638
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:39,681
What did you say
your name was?

639
00:35:39,723 --> 00:35:41,767
Cheryl Ann.

640
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:44,895
It's about my ex-husband.

641
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:49,441
He's back in town and, well,
I haven't seen him for a while.

642
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:54,863
What are you confused about,
Cheryl Ann?

643
00:35:54,947 --> 00:35:56,865
Well, let me first say...

644
00:35:56,949 --> 00:36:00,160
that I left my ex-husband
for very good reasons.

645
00:36:00,244 --> 00:36:03,330
Did it- Let's not
get into them, okay?

646
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:06,708
And he's anything but perfect.

647
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:11,380
He smokes, he drinks,
he loves to argue.

648
00:36:11,463 --> 00:36:14,383
Sounds like my kind of guy.
Yeah.

649
00:36:17,261 --> 00:36:19,221
He is a little bit like you.

650
00:36:19,263 --> 00:36:23,684
Yeah, well, we gotta move
it along here, Cheryl Ann.

651
00:36:23,725 --> 00:36:25,686
You wanna get to the point?

652
00:36:26,895 --> 00:36:30,357
I have, um,
feelings for him.

653
00:36:32,234 --> 00:36:34,153
What kind of feelings?

654
00:36:35,237 --> 00:36:37,281
Nice feelings.

655
00:36:37,364 --> 00:36:39,491
Um...

656
00:36:39,575 --> 00:36:41,535
This is hard to say.

657
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:44,955
Sexual feelings?

658
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:48,584
It's not just that.
I mean, yes, of course, but...

659
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:53,422
I still love him.

660
00:36:53,505 --> 00:36:56,258
It's not the same
with my husband.

661
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,260
We had something,

662
00:36:58,302 --> 00:37:00,846
and... I want him.

663
00:37:02,973 --> 00:37:05,058
I want him inside of me.

664
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:09,563
I want to take care of him.

665
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,401
I want to be with him.

666
00:37:17,029 --> 00:37:18,947
You wanna be close to him.

667
00:37:20,157 --> 00:37:22,117
Yes.

668
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:25,579
You wanna hold him.

669
00:37:27,498 --> 00:37:29,416
Oh, yes.

670
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:33,420
You wanna relive
the feelings you two had.

671
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:36,715
Yes, Barry.

672
00:37:39,134 --> 00:37:41,094
You don't love
your husband?

673
00:37:42,554 --> 00:37:44,473
No. Well, I...

674
00:37:44,556 --> 00:37:46,892
You tell him
that you love him.

675
00:37:46,975 --> 00:37:49,144
You lie to him and
you tell him that you love him.

676
00:37:49,186 --> 00:37:52,272
I do love him.

677
00:37:52,356 --> 00:37:54,733
I love him as a friend.

678
00:37:56,235 --> 00:37:58,362
Friend.

679
00:37:58,445 --> 00:38:00,656
Everyone's your friend.

680
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,992
Not like my ex-husband.

681
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:07,913
There's a passion there
for his soul and...

682
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:16,296
I- I thought I wanted a
simple life, but I-I was wrong.

683
00:38:17,923 --> 00:38:20,133
I want my old life back.

684
00:38:22,302 --> 00:38:24,221
Sounds like
you made a mistake.

685
00:38:25,389 --> 00:38:27,391
Should've stuck with
the first guy.

686
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,062
Yeah, well, what was I
supposed to do?

687
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,487
I love you, Barry.

688
00:38:46,368 --> 00:38:50,664
Ever hear the story of the little
dog who had a bone in his mouth?

689
00:38:50,706 --> 00:38:54,501
And he's trotting over this
bridge and he looks over...

690
00:38:54,585 --> 00:38:56,879
and sees his reflection
in the water.

691
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,922
Thinks it's another dog.

692
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:01,842
That dog has a bone
in his mouth too.

693
00:39:01,884 --> 00:39:05,721
The dog wants both bones, so he
barks at the little dog in the water,

694
00:39:05,762 --> 00:39:07,973
trying to scare him.

695
00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:10,392
Bone drops out of his mouth.

696
00:39:10,434 --> 00:39:13,061
Loses both bones.

697
00:39:16,148 --> 00:39:19,067
What has that got to do
with what I just said?

698
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:21,778
Babe, I don't know
what to tell you.

699
00:39:21,862 --> 00:39:23,822
You blew it!

700
00:39:23,906 --> 00:39:26,450
You know, women like you
are never happy.

701
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:29,912
What do you want me to say? Leave
your husband? Go back to your ex?

702
00:39:29,995 --> 00:39:31,914
Your ex doesn't want you.

703
00:39:31,997 --> 00:39:36,043
He's got women all over the
place. He doesn't need you.

704
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:40,714
He's not some suburban zombie like
your husband. He's out there having fun.

705
00:39:40,797 --> 00:39:44,551
Did you ever think of that? Maybe
your ex-husband doesn't want you?

706
00:39:44,593 --> 00:39:48,096
Hmm? He came on to me.
He said he wanted me.

707
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,766
You're Iying again.
He said he still loved me.

708
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:54,603
You're Iying! You're a sexually
unsatisfied woman living in a dream world!

709
00:39:54,645 --> 00:39:57,940
I feel sorry for you!

710
00:39:58,023 --> 00:39:59,942
So why don't you stick
with Mr. America there,

711
00:40:00,025 --> 00:40:03,737
go out and buy yourself a heavy-duty
vibrator, and knock yourself out.

712
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:08,116
We reap what we sow.

713
00:40:08,158 --> 00:40:10,577
Follow me, Cheryl Ann?

714
00:40:24,216 --> 00:40:28,720
Probably frigid.
And we have Theresa on the line.

715
00:40:29,972 --> 00:40:32,307
The day will come
for you, Barry.

716
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:36,895
And there will be
a reckoning,

717
00:40:36,979 --> 00:40:40,774
an adding up
and a totaling.

718
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:46,113
Those who turned away
will be turned upon.

719
00:40:46,155 --> 00:40:50,826
And I don't care
what your story is, Barry.

720
00:40:50,909 --> 00:40:56,456
You are responsible, and there
will be no confusion at your trial.

721
00:40:58,167 --> 00:41:02,796
It will be short,
and necks will crack.

722
00:41:04,506 --> 00:41:08,302
The whips will strip your back
bare to the bone,

723
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:11,180
and your children
will cry for you...

724
00:41:11,221 --> 00:41:14,850
as they are slaughtered
before your eyes.

725
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:19,646
You...

726
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:24,651
The Jews will hang high
over the streets.

727
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,323
You will be buried in piles.

728
00:41:29,364 --> 00:41:31,366
You dig your own holes.

729
00:41:33,994 --> 00:41:38,165
I am here merely to tell you
that the day will come.

730
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:42,044
It will.

731
00:41:45,881 --> 00:41:48,592
Believe it or not,
you make perfect sense to me.

732
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,639
I should hang.

733
00:41:54,723 --> 00:41:56,642
I'm a hypocrite.

734
00:41:57,976 --> 00:42:00,395
I ask for sincerity,
and I lie.

735
00:42:01,897 --> 00:42:04,316
I denounce the system
as I embrace it.

736
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:10,989
I want money and power
and prestige.

737
00:42:11,073 --> 00:42:13,450
I want ratings and success.

738
00:42:13,534 --> 00:42:18,914
I don't give a damn about you
or the world. That's the truth.

739
00:42:18,956 --> 00:42:24,586
For this, I could say I'm
sorry, but I won't. Why should I?

740
00:42:25,254 --> 00:42:28,423
I mean, who the hell are
you anyways, you audience?

741
00:42:29,633 --> 00:42:31,593
You're on me every night
like a pack of wolves,

742
00:42:31,677 --> 00:42:36,139
'cause you can't stand facing
what you are and what you've made.

743
00:42:36,223 --> 00:42:39,101
Yes, the world
is a terrible place.

744
00:42:39,184 --> 00:42:42,396
Yes, cancer and garbage
disposals will get you.

745
00:42:42,437 --> 00:42:44,398
Yes, a war is coming.

746
00:42:44,439 --> 00:42:46,608
Yes, the world is shot to hell,
and you're all goners.

747
00:42:46,692 --> 00:42:49,778
Everything's screwed up, and
you like it that way, don't you?

748
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,241
You're fascinated
by the gory details.

749
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:58,579
You're mesmerized
by your own fear.

750
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:05,043
You revel in floods,
car accidents.

751
00:43:06,128 --> 00:43:08,046
Unstoppable diseases.

752
00:43:11,925 --> 00:43:14,094
You're happiest
when others are in pain.

753
00:43:15,804 --> 00:43:18,849
That's where I come in,
isn't it?

754
00:43:18,932 --> 00:43:21,685
I'm here to lead you by the
hands through the dark forest...

755
00:43:21,768 --> 00:43:25,689
of your own hatred
and anger and humiliation.

756
00:43:26,773 --> 00:43:28,692
I'm providing a public service.

757
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,529
You're so scared.

758
00:43:32,613 --> 00:43:34,531
You're like a little child
under the covers.

759
00:43:34,615 --> 00:43:38,494
You're afraid of the bogeyman,
but you can't live without him.

760
00:43:38,535 --> 00:43:41,997
Your fear, your own lives,
have become your entertainment.

761
00:43:45,042 --> 00:43:47,878
Next month, millions of people are
gonna be listening to this show,

762
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:50,380
and you'll have
nothing to talk about!

763
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,051
Marvelous technology
is at our disposal.

764
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:57,888
Instead of reaching up to new heights,
we're gonna see how far down we can go.

765
00:43:57,971 --> 00:44:02,476
How deep into the muck
we can immerse ourselves.

766
00:44:02,518 --> 00:44:04,978
What do you wanna
talk about, hmm?

767
00:44:06,021 --> 00:44:08,482
Baseball scores?

768
00:44:08,524 --> 00:44:10,484
Your pet?

769
00:44:11,568 --> 00:44:13,529
Orgasms?

770
00:44:16,573 --> 00:44:19,243
You're pathetic.

771
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:22,246
I despise each
and every one of you.

772
00:44:23,372 --> 00:44:25,791
You got nothing,

773
00:44:25,874 --> 00:44:27,793
absolutely nothing.

774
00:44:29,378 --> 00:44:33,298
No brains, no power, no future.

775
00:44:34,925 --> 00:44:36,885
No hope.

776
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,180
No God.

777
00:44:41,598 --> 00:44:44,059
The only thing
you believe in is me.

778
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:47,938
What are you
if you don't have me?

779
00:44:50,023 --> 00:44:52,526
I'm not afraid, see?

780
00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:56,446
I come in every night, make my case,
make my point, say what I believe in!

781
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:59,908
I tell you what you are.
I have to. I have no choice.

782
00:45:00,951 --> 00:45:02,911
You frighten me.

783
00:45:04,872 --> 00:45:08,167
I come here every night, tear into
you, I abuse you, I insult you,

784
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:10,169
and you just keep
coming back for more.

785
00:45:10,252 --> 00:45:12,588
What's wrong with you?
Why do you keep calling?

786
00:45:12,671 --> 00:45:15,507
I don't wanna hear it anymore.
Stop talking!

787
00:45:15,591 --> 00:45:17,509
Go away!

788
00:45:20,304 --> 00:45:23,515
You're a bunch of yellow-bellied,
spineless, bigoted,

789
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,059
quivering, drunken,
insomniatic,

790
00:45:26,101 --> 00:45:30,022
paranoid, disgusting, perverted,
voyeuristic, little obscene phone callers.

791
00:45:30,105 --> 00:45:32,649
That's what you are.

792
00:45:32,733 --> 00:45:35,360
Well, to hell with you.

793
00:45:35,444 --> 00:45:39,198
I don't need your fear and your
stupidity. You don't get it.

794
00:45:39,281 --> 00:45:41,200
It's wasted on you.

795
00:45:43,994 --> 00:45:46,455
Burros before swine.

796
00:45:56,465 --> 00:46:00,385
If one person out there
had any idea...

797
00:46:00,469 --> 00:46:03,096
of what I'm talking about...

798
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:10,270
Fred, you're on Night Talk.

799
00:46:10,312 --> 00:46:12,981
Yes. You see, Barry,

800
00:46:13,065 --> 00:46:16,443
I know it's depressing that so many
people don't understand you're just joking.

801
00:46:16,485 --> 00:46:18,445
Jackie, you're on Night Talk.

802
00:46:18,487 --> 00:46:22,199
Hello. I've been listening for years,
and I find you a warm and intelligent...

803
00:46:22,282 --> 00:46:24,201
Arnold.

804
00:46:24,284 --> 00:46:27,204
What you were saying before about
loneliness, I'm an electrical engineer...

805
00:46:27,287 --> 00:46:31,291
Lucy. My mother is from Waco and wants
to know if you went to high school...

806
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:35,671
Larry. Why do people insist
on calling homosexuals normal?

807
00:46:35,712 --> 00:46:39,091
Ralph!
I'm in my house.

808
00:46:39,174 --> 00:46:41,301
I'm at home,

809
00:46:41,343 --> 00:46:44,638
which is where
you should be, Barry.

810
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:48,851
Hey, I'm not far away.
You could come over if you want.

811
00:46:48,892 --> 00:46:51,478
We're the same kind of people.

812
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,982
I have beer, soup.

813
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:00,028
I'm here.

814
00:47:00,779 --> 00:47:02,698
Come over later.

815
00:47:04,533 --> 00:47:07,870
I'll wait.

816
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,003
Barry, there's 60 seconds
left in the show.

817
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,936
This is dead air, Barry.

818
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,938
Dead air.

819
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:10,891
I guess we're stuck
with each other.

820
00:48:12,643 --> 00:48:14,770
This is Barry Champlaign.

821
00:48:41,129 --> 00:48:43,549
Barry.

822
00:48:49,847 --> 00:48:54,226
That was great.
I feel very good about this.

823
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:58,188
I'm gonna talk to the lawyers, and we'll
get started on this deal right away.

824
00:48:58,272 --> 00:49:01,358
We're gonna be seeing
a lot more of each other.

825
00:49:01,441 --> 00:49:03,360
I'll be in touch.

826
00:49:06,155 --> 00:49:08,115
Barry.

827
00:49:13,162 --> 00:49:15,664
That was great.

828
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:20,002
You pulled it off, champ.
Congratulations.

829
00:49:21,086 --> 00:49:23,755
I'll see you tomorrow.

830
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,757
Dan.

831
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,679
What if I don't come in
tomorrow night?

832
00:49:31,763 --> 00:49:33,682
You'll come in tomorrow,
Barry.

833
00:49:34,892 --> 00:49:36,852
You always do.

834
00:49:45,903 --> 00:49:48,864
She left, huh?
Yep. I don't blame her.

835
00:49:50,491 --> 00:49:55,496
Her best line was, "Barry
Champlaign's a nice place to visit,

836
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:58,040
but I wouldn't want
to live there."

837
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:02,503
The show's a washout, Stu.

838
00:50:02,544 --> 00:50:06,006
Give me a break, will you?
We're going national, man.

839
00:50:06,089 --> 00:50:09,676
Besides, it's not that
important. It's just one show.

840
00:50:11,303 --> 00:50:14,848
If it's not that important, why
am I doing it? I don't know, Barry.

841
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:16,934
You don't like the heights,
don't climb the mountains.

842
00:50:17,017 --> 00:50:20,813
You know what I mean? It's
like that kid just said:

843
00:50:20,896 --> 00:50:23,732
"Man, this is your show."

844
00:50:23,774 --> 00:50:25,734
Where you headed?

845
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:32,366
I don't know. Go to
Ellen's hotel, try to talk.

846
00:50:32,407 --> 00:50:34,952
That's good.
Tomorrow, Barry.

847
00:50:35,035 --> 00:50:36,954
Before I take
the first caller this evening,

848
00:50:37,037 --> 00:50:39,623
Tomorrow, Stu. I'd like to
comment on something I saw...

849
00:50:39,706 --> 00:50:43,085
in the parking lot
on the way into the station.

850
00:50:43,126 --> 00:50:46,922
There was a man standing there,
Walk you to your car?

851
00:50:47,005 --> 00:50:48,924
obviously mentally disturbed.

852
00:50:49,007 --> 00:50:51,760
It made me think about something
we don't often talk about.

853
00:50:54,429 --> 00:50:57,015
Wanna grab a burger,
just talk?

854
00:51:02,604 --> 00:51:05,023
I'm too old for you,
Laura.

855
00:51:05,107 --> 00:51:07,025
Ow.

856
00:51:08,569 --> 00:51:13,198
I mean, you don't
know about Vietnam,

857
00:51:13,282 --> 00:51:15,993
Easy Rider, Beatles.

858
00:51:16,076 --> 00:51:18,162
Start over, Grandpa.

859
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,833
I can't.

860
00:51:22,916 --> 00:51:25,294
I'm inside this thing.

861
00:51:25,377 --> 00:51:27,296
You're not.

862
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,301
You know what
my greatest fear is?

863
00:51:33,385 --> 00:51:35,304
Being boring.

864
00:51:36,388 --> 00:51:39,600
You're not boring.

865
00:51:39,641 --> 00:51:44,605
I'm afraid that the whole
audience is gonna get up and leave.

866
00:51:50,402 --> 00:51:52,488
I get confused sometimes
about this love stuff.

867
00:51:52,571 --> 00:51:57,993
I don't know what people mean
when they say that they're in love,

868
00:51:58,076 --> 00:51:59,995
but...

869
00:52:01,914 --> 00:52:05,834
but I do know that I don't think
you're the bad guy you think you are.

870
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:11,798
Yes, I am.

871
00:52:12,841 --> 00:52:15,177
I'll take a rain check
on that burger.

872
00:52:33,529 --> 00:52:37,449
Excuse me, Barry.
Barry. Mr. Champlaign.

873
00:52:37,533 --> 00:52:40,702
I hate to bother you. Do you think
you could give me an autograph, please?

874
00:52:40,744 --> 00:52:43,247
Some show tonight.
Sure.

875
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:46,208
What'd you say your name was?
You're dead, fucker.

876
00:53:29,918 --> 00:53:31,837
You come on down
to these parts,

877
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,798
you start telling people their
business and insulting their race,

878
00:53:34,882 --> 00:53:37,551
you end up like Champlaign,
I'll tell you that right now.

879
00:53:37,593 --> 00:53:41,138
I listened to his show the
night that he was killed.

880
00:53:41,221 --> 00:53:44,850
There was this drug-crazed
kid bothering him.

881
00:53:44,933 --> 00:53:49,313
When people smoke that crack
stuff, they go berserk, you know?

882
00:53:49,396 --> 00:53:51,315
I hope they catch
that kid.

883
00:53:51,398 --> 00:53:54,735
But they ought to listen to
that show. He was on the air.

884
00:53:54,776 --> 00:53:57,654
I didn't think he was gonna
get shot or anything,

885
00:53:57,738 --> 00:53:59,865
but that show was strange.

886
00:53:59,948 --> 00:54:04,036
I mean, I got to be on his show the
last day. That was his last show.

887
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:07,456
I feel kinda like my whole
life is different, you know?

888
00:54:07,539 --> 00:54:10,292
Like I'm kinda blessed.

889
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:13,962
But like I told Barry,
you know, I mean, hey,

890
00:54:14,046 --> 00:54:18,300
life is kinda just like
a big party thrown by God,

891
00:54:18,342 --> 00:54:20,802
and I'm the new
toastmaster, Bar.

892
00:54:35,234 --> 00:54:37,653
Like Barry always said,

893
00:54:37,736 --> 00:54:41,156
if you didn't like him,
turn him off.

894
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,494
But they didn't have
to kill him.

895
00:54:45,577 --> 00:54:49,706
I think that young boy that had come
in on the show, I think he did it.

896
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:51,708
I'll tell you
how I feel about it.

897
00:54:51,792 --> 00:54:53,710
I think if you steal something,
they oughta cut your hands off.

898
00:54:53,794 --> 00:54:55,796
If you rape somebody, they ought
a cut your you-know-what off.

899
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:58,757
I never called him.

900
00:54:58,841 --> 00:55:00,968
And now I'm sorry.

901
00:55:01,051 --> 00:55:03,011
He never even hung up on me.

902
00:55:05,013 --> 00:55:07,891
I miss him. You know how when
you have a cast on your arm...

903
00:55:07,975 --> 00:55:10,143
and they cut it off,
you miss having it?

904
00:55:10,185 --> 00:55:14,106
He was like a cast
on my arm. I miss him.

905
00:55:14,189 --> 00:55:16,984
He was like a hot-fudge sundae
with fresh pecans.

906
00:55:17,025 --> 00:55:19,862
Now, I knew I shouldn't listen
to him 'cause he always got me...

907
00:55:19,903 --> 00:55:23,407
so dog-dang riled up till I
was like to smash my radio.

908
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:27,744
He did a whole show once on which
way to roll your toilet paper.

909
00:55:27,828 --> 00:55:32,082
Over or under?
People responded for hours.

910
00:55:32,166 --> 00:55:34,376
Some got so angry,
they hung up.

911
00:55:34,459 --> 00:55:38,255
I called almost every night.
I loved Barry.

912
00:55:38,338 --> 00:55:41,049
Didn't care much for the fellow
who answered the phone, though.

913
00:55:41,133 --> 00:55:43,969
You know, he always forgot
I was waiting on the line.

914
00:55:44,052 --> 00:55:47,806
Didn't I read he was having some
kind of problem with his wife?

915
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:50,851
Yes, he was
insensitive and nasty,

916
00:55:50,893 --> 00:55:53,854
but he was a strong, masculine
presence on the radio.

917
00:55:53,896 --> 00:55:56,982
Why would anyone
do such a thing?

918
00:55:57,065 --> 00:56:01,236
Oh, well, there's another
bright star in God's heaven.

919
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:05,407
My view is that you don't give
a group like the neo- Nazis...

920
00:56:05,491 --> 00:56:07,409
access to the airways
like he did.

921
00:56:07,493 --> 00:56:10,412
Basically, I couldn't stand
Barry Champlaign.

922
00:56:10,496 --> 00:56:14,416
I was in love with his voice.
I was in love with his voice.

923
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:16,752
He was in love
with his own voice.

924
00:56:16,793 --> 00:56:22,591
My first thought was that I couldn't
believe anyone could hate him that much.

925
00:56:22,633 --> 00:56:27,971
Disagree or dislike, but
not hate him. Not kill him.

926
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:32,935
My second thought was...

927
00:56:33,018 --> 00:56:36,647
that he always wondered
if there was a God.

928
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:40,150
Barry said he had to wait
until the evidence was in.

929
00:56:42,736 --> 00:56:44,655
Now you know, Barry.

930
00:56:44,738 --> 00:56:46,448
Now you know.

931
00:56:47,282 --> 00:56:51,745
Now, we know that whatever the law
says, it speaks to those under the law...

932
00:56:51,787 --> 00:56:56,208
so that every mouth
maybe stopped...

933
00:56:56,291 --> 00:57:00,379
and the whole world
may be held accountable to God.

934
00:57:00,462 --> 00:57:02,381
The world is crazy, crazy!

935
00:57:02,464 --> 00:57:05,676
Barry was rude, but
he was a funny guy too.

936
00:57:05,759 --> 00:57:08,220
He insulted my mother
when I called,

937
00:57:08,303 --> 00:57:10,722
but this is why we have
freedom of speech.

938
00:57:10,806 --> 00:57:13,892
I hope that when
they remember Barry,

939
00:57:13,976 --> 00:57:16,937
they remember
what he said...

940
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:19,565
and not the style
in which he said it.

941
00:57:19,648 --> 00:57:21,567
It was karmic.

942
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:23,652
You just can't put out
that much bad karma...

943
00:57:23,735 --> 00:57:25,696
without it coming
back at you.

944
00:57:25,779 --> 00:57:28,699
Barry and I worked together
for over seven years.

945
00:57:28,782 --> 00:57:32,703
Whenever you threatened him over the air,
man, he'd stick it right back in your face.

946
00:57:32,786 --> 00:57:34,705
It was like his dick
was flapping in the wing...

947
00:57:34,788 --> 00:57:37,499
and he liked to see
if he could get an erection.

948
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:42,129
The guy had a little dick, but
he liked to flap it out there.

949
00:57:42,212 --> 00:57:45,090
Then they cut if off.
Now he's dead.

950
00:57:45,174 --> 00:57:47,843
I don't know if you
understand that analogy,

951
00:57:47,926 --> 00:57:49,845
but it's the clearest one
I can make.
