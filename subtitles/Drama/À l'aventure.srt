1
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,111
Dedicated to
Monogram Pictures

2
00:00:39,547 --> 00:00:45,260
BREATHLESS

3
00:00:47,055 --> 00:00:49,723
After all, I'm an asshole.

4
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,245
After all, yes, I've got to. I've got to!

5
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:03,772
Michel...

6
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,940
Take me with you.

7
00:02:05,108 --> 00:02:06,566
- What time is it?
- 10:50.

8
00:02:06,734 --> 00:02:08,068
No. Ciao!

9
00:02:08,236 --> 00:02:11,238
Gotta make tracks, Max!

10
00:02:30,675 --> 00:02:35,178
If he thinks he's gonna pass me
in his crappy Renault!

11
00:02:45,106 --> 00:02:47,107
I collect the dough,

12
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:49,609
I ask Patricia if it's yes or no,

13
00:02:49,777 --> 00:02:51,528
and then...

14
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:06,418
Nothing like the countryside.

15
00:03:15,636 --> 00:03:17,971
I really like France.

16
00:03:22,852 --> 00:03:25,103
If you don't like the shore...

17
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,899
if you don't like the mountains...

18
00:03:29,734 --> 00:03:32,652
if you don't like the city...

19
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,114
then get stuffed!

20
00:03:42,246 --> 00:03:46,291
Little girls hitchhiking!

21
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:49,002
I'll charge a kiss per mile.

22
00:03:50,671 --> 00:03:54,341
The short one's not bad. Nice legs.

23
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:57,469
Yeah, but the other one...

24
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,013
Oh, hell, they're both dogs.

25
00:04:24,205 --> 00:04:26,331
Nothing like sunshine.

26
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:35,048
Women drivers
are cowardice personified.

27
00:04:35,216 --> 00:04:37,509
Pass him!

28
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:39,845
Oh, shit, it's the roadwork!

29
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,691
Never brake.

30
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:57,237
As old man Bugatti said:
"My cars are made to run, not stop."

31
00:04:59,156 --> 00:05:00,407
Shit! The pigs!

32
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,340
Contact's gone!

33
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,594
This is the pits!

34
00:05:36,652 --> 00:05:38,778
Hold it right there!

35
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,709
- Miss Franchini's room?
- She isn't here.

36
00:06:34,877 --> 00:06:37,128
- She does live here?
- But she's out!

37
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,682
Girls never have cash.

38
00:06:49,517 --> 00:06:51,017
Coffee.

39
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,148
- How much for ham and eggs?
- 180 francs.

40
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,361
Make it one.

41
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,783
Gotta get a paper. Be right back.

42
00:07:30,307 --> 00:07:31,558
Can I come in?

43
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:33,560
How's it going, precious?

44
00:07:33,728 --> 00:07:35,395
No jacket?

45
00:07:35,563 --> 00:07:37,731
It's in my Alfa Romeo.

46
00:07:37,898 --> 00:07:41,067
- Want breakfast at the Royal?
- I'm late.

47
00:07:41,235 --> 00:07:43,737
Gotta be at the TV station at 9:10.

48
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,369
It's torn.

49
00:08:01,756 --> 00:08:03,882
What've you been up to?

50
00:08:04,925 --> 00:08:06,509
Nothing much. Traveling.

51
00:08:07,344 --> 00:08:09,304
- What's new in the Quarter?
- Don't know.

52
00:08:09,472 --> 00:08:13,725
- You don't go out?
- Dancing sometimes.

53
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:15,894
Still in the movies?

54
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:18,938
No. You gotta sleep around.

55
00:08:19,148 --> 00:08:20,982
Do you recollect Enrico?

56
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:25,695
"Remember" or "recall."
But not "recollect."

57
00:08:25,863 --> 00:08:29,199
I work with him at the station.
As script girl.

58
00:08:30,117 --> 00:08:33,953
When I was broke in December,
I was assistant on a picture.

59
00:08:34,121 --> 00:08:35,246
At Cinecittà!

60
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:37,248
- You?
- Yep, me.

61
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,125
Ever been a gigolo?

62
00:08:39,293 --> 00:08:40,376
Why?

63
00:08:40,544 --> 00:08:42,253
Just asking.

64
00:08:43,172 --> 00:08:45,548
I wouldn't mind.

65
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,304
Call me back in a few minutes.

66
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,267
Is Gaby back from Spain?

67
00:08:56,685 --> 00:08:59,479
- He bought the Café Pergola.
- He did?

68
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,980
Great.

69
00:09:01,148 --> 00:09:03,441
The black paint's a stupid idea.

70
00:09:04,735 --> 00:09:07,862
- What's that say?
- "Why?"

71
00:09:08,906 --> 00:09:10,657
But I switched to Luckies.

72
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:15,495
Can you lend me 5,000 francs
till noon?

73
00:09:15,663 --> 00:09:17,539
I should've known.

74
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:21,042
You're rotten, Michel.

75
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,336
I'll pay you back at noon.

76
00:09:23,504 --> 00:09:25,630
Anyway, I don't have that much.

77
00:09:27,508 --> 00:09:30,718
- Here's 500 if you want.
- Keep it.

78
00:09:55,703 --> 00:09:59,914
- So no breakfast at the Royal?
- I'm really late.

79
00:10:07,298 --> 00:10:08,840
Is Mr. Tolmachoff here?

80
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:11,551
He's here, but he's not here.

81
00:10:11,969 --> 00:10:13,720
Seen Patricia?

82
00:10:23,606 --> 00:10:26,107
Come with me to Rome?

83
00:10:28,611 --> 00:10:30,153
It's crazy, but I love you.

84
00:10:30,321 --> 00:10:33,531
I wanted to see
if I'd be glad to see you again.

85
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,742
Where you been? Monte Carlo?

86
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:40,330
No, Marseilles.
There was a guy I had to see.

87
00:10:40,497 --> 00:10:42,373
I tried calling you Monday.

88
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,084
I was out of town Monday and Sunday.

89
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:50,423
- I'll take one.
- That's nice of you.

90
00:10:55,638 --> 00:10:59,140
What are you doing here?
I thought you hated Paris.

91
00:10:59,308 --> 00:11:01,976
No, but I've got enemies here.

92
00:11:02,144 --> 00:11:03,603
So you're in danger?

93
00:11:03,771 --> 00:11:06,314
Yeah. Will you come to Rome with me?

94
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:08,191
To do what?

95
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:09,442
We'll see.

96
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,195
No, I've got lots to do here.

97
00:11:12,363 --> 00:11:14,739
You going up or down the Champs?

98
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:17,909
- What's the "Champs"?
- The Champs-Élysées.

99
00:11:20,037 --> 00:11:23,456
- I gotta be on Avenue George V.
- See you, then.

100
00:11:23,624 --> 00:11:25,625
Come on, walk me.

101
00:11:25,793 --> 00:11:28,127
Just to the corner.

102
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,974
- Take it back. No horoscope!
- What's "horoscope"?

103
00:11:41,141 --> 00:11:45,186
The future. I wanna know
the future. Don't you?

104
00:11:45,354 --> 00:11:46,980
Sure.

105
00:11:52,695 --> 00:11:56,447
- What is it?
- Nothing. Just looking at you.

106
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:01,703
You're mad I left without a good-bye.

107
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,831
No, I was furious
because I was sad.

108
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:10,169
It's nice to wake up next to a girl.

109
00:12:10,337 --> 00:12:12,755
Are you staying in town?

110
00:12:14,174 --> 00:12:16,926
Yeah, I have to see a guy
who owes me money.

111
00:12:17,094 --> 00:12:18,928
Then I have to see you.

112
00:12:19,096 --> 00:12:20,680
You don't have to.

113
00:12:20,848 --> 00:12:22,432
Why?

114
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,143
There are prettier girls than me here.

115
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:28,938
No. It's weird.
I've slept with two girls since you.

116
00:12:29,106 --> 00:12:31,524
We didn't jive at all.

117
00:12:33,027 --> 00:12:34,110
You didn't "jive"?

118
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:39,324
They were pretty,
but we didn't jive. It was sad.

119
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:42,535
So will you come to Rome?
I'm fed up with France.

120
00:12:42,703 --> 00:12:44,245
I can't, Michel.

121
00:12:44,413 --> 00:12:48,458
I have to enroll at the Sorbonne
or my parents will stop sending money.

122
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,294
- I've got money.
- We only had three nights together.

123
00:12:51,462 --> 00:12:53,212
No, five.

124
00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:56,382
- Why don't you wear a bra?
- That's no way to talk.

125
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,885
Okay, sorry!

126
00:13:00,054 --> 00:13:02,305
What time is it? See you later?

127
00:13:02,473 --> 00:13:05,141
Not later. Tonight. Okay?

128
00:13:05,726 --> 00:13:08,644
- Where?
- Here.

129
00:13:27,414 --> 00:13:29,957
Live dangerously until the end!

130
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,801
Have you anything against youth?

131
00:13:39,968 --> 00:13:42,678
Sure do. I prefer old people.

132
00:14:03,826 --> 00:14:06,536
Police Killer Identified

133
00:14:13,043 --> 00:14:15,044
Is Mr. Tolmachoff in?

134
00:14:15,212 --> 00:14:17,630
At the airline desk.

135
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,816
- Hey, amigo.
- Hey, sonny.

136
00:14:36,984 --> 00:14:38,651
You the one who came by at 10:00?

137
00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:40,153
Yeah, for my money.

138
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,155
It's ready for you.

139
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,920
- How's life?
- I got bored down south.

140
00:14:58,088 --> 00:15:00,173
I came up to see a girl. And you?

141
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,758
I'm getting out of here.
I'm rusting away.

142
00:15:02,926 --> 00:15:05,386
Better rusted than busted.

143
00:15:09,641 --> 00:15:11,100
Over here.

144
00:15:15,105 --> 00:15:17,690
Have the envelope I gave you?

145
00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:27,200
Why'd the jerk cross it?

146
00:15:27,367 --> 00:15:29,994
Sign it over to someone else.

147
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:33,706
Not to me.
I blew my last cent at the races.

148
00:15:33,874 --> 00:15:36,167
And your pal, Bob Montagné?

149
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:39,420
- He's in the pen, the idiot.
- No kidding.

150
00:15:39,588 --> 00:15:42,048
There's Berruti, but I don't trust him.

151
00:15:42,216 --> 00:15:44,258
I thought he was your pal.

152
00:15:44,426 --> 00:15:45,551
Is he back?

153
00:15:45,719 --> 00:15:49,222
Yes, I saw him
in Montparnasse last night.

154
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,980
What's his number?

155
00:15:58,148 --> 00:16:00,149
Élysées 99-84.

156
00:16:00,317 --> 00:16:01,984
Can I call from here?

157
00:16:07,115 --> 00:16:08,908
Who's the girl you came for?

158
00:16:09,076 --> 00:16:10,660
A New Yorker.

159
00:16:10,827 --> 00:16:11,911
Pretty?

160
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,455
She's funny. I like her.

161
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,044
Élysées 99-84?

162
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,672
I'd like to speak to Antonio.

163
00:16:25,926 --> 00:16:27,593
I'll call back.

164
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:31,806
He's out. I'll try somewhere else.

165
00:16:31,974 --> 00:16:34,100
- Bye, sonny.
- Ciao, amigo.

166
00:16:41,775 --> 00:16:43,985
Inter-Americana Agency?

167
00:16:44,152 --> 00:16:46,153
Yes, this is it.

168
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:50,283
Do customers have mail
forwarded here?

169
00:16:50,784 --> 00:16:53,953
Know a certain Michel Poiccard?

170
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:58,124
Also goes by the name
of László Kovács.

171
00:16:58,292 --> 00:17:00,626
Ask the gentleman over there.

172
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:18,728
If it isn't Tolmachoff!

173
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:21,647
Hello, Inspector.

174
00:17:21,815 --> 00:17:24,066
In the travel business now?

175
00:17:24,234 --> 00:17:26,068
As you can see.

176
00:17:29,573 --> 00:17:33,326
Remember how you ratted
on your friend Bob?

177
00:17:33,994 --> 00:17:35,161
What if I did?

178
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:38,164
You're going to do it again.

179
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,667
Michel Poiccard, 5'9".

180
00:17:41,835 --> 00:17:45,212
Brown hair.
Former Air France steward.

181
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,507
Has his mail sent here.

182
00:17:48,675 --> 00:17:50,092
Yes, I know him.

183
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,012
He been around lately?

184
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:05,483
Has anyone been to see
Mr. Tolmachoff recently?

185
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:08,778
Yes, just five minutes ago.
A fairly tall man.

186
00:18:08,945 --> 00:18:10,821
Christ Almighty!

187
00:18:12,616 --> 00:18:15,201
"Accessory to murder"...
mean anything to you?

188
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:49,568
The Harder They Fall

189
00:18:49,736 --> 00:18:51,404
Bogey...

190
00:19:29,651 --> 00:19:32,820
- I saw a man die.
- How'd he die?

191
00:19:32,988 --> 00:19:34,447
In an accident.

192
00:19:34,614 --> 00:19:36,615
Take me out to dinner?

193
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,039
Let me make another call first.
Wait for me?

194
00:19:44,207 --> 00:19:46,834
Call from the restaurant.

195
00:19:48,879 --> 00:19:50,588
I'll just be a second.

196
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:54,967
The French always say one second
when they mean five minutes.

197
00:20:49,731 --> 00:20:50,731
Where we going?

198
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:53,692
Anywhere. The Latin Quarter.

199
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,487
- Sleep with me tonight?
- I don't know.

200
00:20:56,655 --> 00:21:00,157
- Don't you like it with me?
- Sure, I do.

201
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:05,454
I just read something neat.
About a bus conductor.

202
00:21:05,622 --> 00:21:10,209
He stole five million to seduce a girl,
posing as a rich impresario.

203
00:21:10,377 --> 00:21:14,338
He took her to the Riviera.
They blew the wad in three days.

204
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:18,259
The guy didn't cop out.
He told her,

205
00:21:18,426 --> 00:21:21,720
"It's stolen money, I'm a hood,
but I like you."

206
00:21:24,015 --> 00:21:28,978
What's great is that she stuck by him.
She said, "I like you, too."

207
00:21:29,145 --> 00:21:30,771
They came back to Paris

208
00:21:30,939 --> 00:21:34,066
and were nabbed trying to rob
some fancy villas.

209
00:21:34,234 --> 00:21:37,236
She stood lookout.
That was sweet of her.

210
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:41,907
Excuse me, got a light?

211
00:21:42,075 --> 00:21:45,369
Here! Go buy yourself a matchbook.

212
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:47,371
I totally forgot!

213
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,915
- I have an appointment.
- Who with?

214
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:54,587
A journalist on the Champs-Élysées.
We're going to a press conference.

215
00:21:54,754 --> 00:21:56,171
Where? Now?

216
00:21:56,339 --> 00:22:00,634
None of your business.
You can really be annoying.

217
00:22:01,678 --> 00:22:03,888
So you're leaving me?

218
00:22:04,055 --> 00:22:06,056
But I'll see you tomorrow.

219
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,559
Not tomorrow.
Tonight, Patricia.

220
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,644
I told you I can't.

221
00:22:10,812 --> 00:22:12,897
Why are you so mean?

222
00:22:13,607 --> 00:22:14,815
Any taxis around?

223
00:22:14,983 --> 00:22:18,652
I'm parked by the Opera. Want a lift?

224
00:22:21,448 --> 00:22:23,616
What happened to the Ford?

225
00:22:23,783 --> 00:22:25,743
It's in the garage.

226
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,245
Let me stay with you.

227
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:30,789
I've got a headache.

228
00:22:30,957 --> 00:22:34,043
We won't have sex.
I just want to be with you.

229
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,587
That's not it, Michel.

230
00:22:42,385 --> 00:22:45,638
- Why are you so sad?
- Because I am.

231
00:22:45,805 --> 00:22:47,681
That's silly.

232
00:22:49,517 --> 00:22:51,852
Why are you so sad?

233
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,146
Should I use "vous" or "tu"?

234
00:22:54,314 --> 00:22:57,107
No difference.
But I can't do without you.

235
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:58,400
Yes, you can.

236
00:22:58,568 --> 00:23:01,153
Maybe. But I don't want to.

237
00:23:04,866 --> 00:23:07,743
Just look at that swell Talbot.
A 2.5 liter.

238
00:23:08,495 --> 00:23:11,038
- You're a guy who...
- What?

239
00:23:12,832 --> 00:23:13,916
Oh, I don't know.

240
00:23:14,084 --> 00:23:17,962
Look at me.
I forbid you to meet this guy.

241
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:27,012
Woe is me!

242
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,848
I love a girl with a pretty neck,

243
00:23:30,016 --> 00:23:32,935
pretty breasts, a pretty voice,

244
00:23:33,103 --> 00:23:34,603
pretty wrists,

245
00:23:34,771 --> 00:23:36,188
a pretty forehead,

246
00:23:36,356 --> 00:23:38,607
and pretty knees...

247
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,572
But she's such a coward.

248
00:23:48,034 --> 00:23:50,369
- It's right here. Stop.
- Let me park first.

249
00:23:50,537 --> 00:23:52,788
Don't bother.

250
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:57,084
Get lost!

251
00:23:57,877 --> 00:23:59,753
I never want to see you again.

252
00:23:59,921 --> 00:24:01,714
Get lost!

253
00:24:04,384 --> 00:24:06,677
You make me want to puke.

254
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:56,435
It'd be a shame
if that happened to you.

255
00:24:57,353 --> 00:24:59,104
We'll see.

256
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:01,315
What's wrong?

257
00:25:02,692 --> 00:25:06,904
If I could dig a hole
to hide in, I would.

258
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:12,034
Do like elephants do.
When they're sad...

259
00:25:24,255 --> 00:25:26,131
Let me tell you a story.

260
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:28,634
It'll take your mind off things.

261
00:25:28,802 --> 00:25:30,761
There's this girl I know.

262
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:34,473
The other day, I figured,
"I'll ask her to sleep with me."

263
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:38,060
It had never occurred to me before.
We met for lunch.

264
00:25:38,228 --> 00:25:42,981
I wanted to say,
"We're friends. Let's sleep together."

265
00:25:43,149 --> 00:25:47,986
I don't know why,
but it completely slipped my mind!

266
00:25:49,322 --> 00:25:53,117
Later I suddenly remembered
and sent her a telegram saying:

267
00:25:53,284 --> 00:25:56,787
"I forgot to suggest
that we sleep together."

268
00:25:56,955 --> 00:26:00,749
Three hours later I get
a message back, saying:

269
00:26:00,917 --> 00:26:03,460
"What an amazing coincidence!

270
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:07,005
I was thinking exactly the same thing!"

271
00:27:22,081 --> 00:27:25,542
- This the late edition?
- Yes, sir.

272
00:28:43,162 --> 00:28:44,579
Where's my key?

273
00:28:44,747 --> 00:28:47,833
You must've left it in the door.

274
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,173
What the heck!

275
00:28:57,593 --> 00:28:59,344
What are you doing here?

276
00:28:59,512 --> 00:29:01,805
The Claridge was booked up.

277
00:29:02,348 --> 00:29:06,226
So I came here.
I took the key downstairs.

278
00:29:06,394 --> 00:29:09,104
There are other places
than the Claridge.

279
00:29:09,272 --> 00:29:12,566
I always stay at the Claridge.

280
00:29:12,734 --> 00:29:15,360
You're crazy.

281
00:29:15,528 --> 00:29:17,696
Don't make such a face.

282
00:29:19,198 --> 00:29:21,199
It doesn't suit you.

283
00:29:23,286 --> 00:29:26,204
- What's "making a face"?
- Going like this.

284
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:35,922
It suits me just fine.

285
00:29:36,632 --> 00:29:38,425
You're even crazier than me.

286
00:29:38,593 --> 00:29:40,218
Goddammit.

287
00:29:41,721 --> 00:29:45,098
I always fall for girls
who aren't my type.

288
00:29:46,642 --> 00:29:50,312
Did you notice I followed you
last night? Answer me.

289
00:29:52,565 --> 00:29:53,940
What's wrong?

290
00:29:54,108 --> 00:29:57,069
Leave me alone. I'm thinking.

291
00:29:57,945 --> 00:29:59,571
What about?

292
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,284
What's horrible is, I don't even know.

293
00:30:04,952 --> 00:30:06,286
Well, I do.

294
00:30:06,454 --> 00:30:08,830
No, nobody does.

295
00:30:08,998 --> 00:30:12,417
You're thinking about last night.
Yes, you are.

296
00:30:12,585 --> 00:30:17,756
Last night I was furious,
but now I couldn't care less.

297
00:30:17,924 --> 00:30:20,926
I'm not thinking about anything.

298
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:29,184
I'd like to think about something,
but I can't seem to.

299
00:30:29,852 --> 00:30:33,563
Well, I'm tired, very tired,

300
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:36,441
and I'm going back to sleep.

301
00:30:42,615 --> 00:30:46,493
- Why are you looking at me?
- Because I am.

302
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,622
- You should've stayed with me.
- I couldn't.

303
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:54,876
You should've told the guy
you couldn't see him.

304
00:30:55,044 --> 00:30:57,796
I had to.
He's getting me articles to write.

305
00:30:57,964 --> 00:31:00,507
It's really important for me.

306
00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:03,844
What's important
is going to Rome with me.

307
00:31:04,011 --> 00:31:06,555
Maybe. I don't know.

308
00:31:07,515 --> 00:31:09,391
Did you sleep with him?

309
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,477
I bet you did.

310
00:31:12,645 --> 00:31:15,647
No. He's really sweet.

311
00:31:15,815 --> 00:31:19,818
He said we'd sleep together
someday, but not now.

312
00:31:19,986 --> 00:31:22,237
But he doesn't even know me.

313
00:31:22,405 --> 00:31:25,282
Not you. Him and me.

314
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,034
We had a drink in Montparnasse.

315
00:31:28,202 --> 00:31:31,746
I was there, too. At what time?

316
00:31:31,914 --> 00:31:35,000
I don't know. We didn't stay long.

317
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:39,171
Why'd you come here, Michel?

318
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:43,300
Because I want to sleep
with you again.

319
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:46,178
That's hardly a reason.

320
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:49,181
Sure it is. It means I love you.

321
00:31:49,348 --> 00:31:52,684
But I don't know if I love you yet.

322
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,854
When will you know?

323
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,898
Soon.

324
00:31:58,274 --> 00:32:01,943
What's that mean, "soon"?
In a month, a year?

325
00:32:02,111 --> 00:32:04,863
Soon means soon.

326
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:07,824
A woman will never do in eight seconds

327
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:11,286
what she'll gladly do eight days later.

328
00:32:12,038 --> 00:32:14,956
It's all the same,
eight seconds or eight days.

329
00:32:15,374 --> 00:32:17,667
Why not eight centuries?

330
00:32:18,377 --> 00:32:20,795
No, eight days is fine.

331
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:25,175
Women always do things halfway.

332
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:27,677
It gets me down.

333
00:32:30,223 --> 00:32:32,432
Why won't you sleep with me?

334
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,143
Because I'm trying to find out

335
00:32:35,311 --> 00:32:39,231
what it is that I like about you.

336
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:42,234
I want us to be
like Romeo and Juliet.

337
00:32:43,277 --> 00:32:44,903
That's just like a girl!

338
00:32:45,071 --> 00:32:50,784
See? You said last night you couldn't
live without me, but you can.

339
00:32:50,952 --> 00:32:55,413
Romeo couldn't live without Juliet,
but you can.

340
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,751
No, I can't live without you.

341
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:03,547
That's just like a guy!

342
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:05,590
Give me a smile.

343
00:33:08,511 --> 00:33:10,428
I'll count to eight.

344
00:33:10,596 --> 00:33:15,058
If by eight you haven't smiled,
I'll strangle you.

345
00:33:16,602 --> 00:33:18,103
Two...

346
00:33:18,604 --> 00:33:20,105
Three...

347
00:33:20,273 --> 00:33:22,148
Four, five, six...

348
00:33:22,441 --> 00:33:24,192
Seven...

349
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,444
Seven and a half...

350
00:33:26,612 --> 00:33:29,114
Seven and three quarters.

351
00:33:29,615 --> 00:33:32,951
You're such a coward.
I bet you're gonna smile.

352
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,959
Enough games for today.

353
00:33:44,171 --> 00:33:46,089
You're a coward. Too bad.

354
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:47,966
Why do you say that?

355
00:33:48,134 --> 00:33:49,509
You get on my nerves.

356
00:33:49,677 --> 00:33:51,553
You do, too.

357
00:33:51,971 --> 00:33:53,305
I'm not a coward.

358
00:33:53,472 --> 00:33:55,307
What makes you think I'm scared?

359
00:33:55,474 --> 00:33:59,394
If a girl says everything's fine
then can't even light her cigarette,

360
00:33:59,562 --> 00:34:02,355
it means she's scared of something.

361
00:34:02,523 --> 00:34:05,567
I don't know of what, but she's scared.

362
00:34:07,695 --> 00:34:08,820
Have one.

363
00:34:08,988 --> 00:34:11,239
None of those Chesterfields.

364
00:34:11,407 --> 00:34:14,117
Hand me my jacket.

365
00:34:14,368 --> 00:34:16,494
- This pocket?
- Give!

366
00:34:18,664 --> 00:34:20,582
This your passport?

367
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:23,043
No, my brother's. Mine's in the car.

368
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:25,712
But it says Kovács here.

369
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,923
Oh, yeah? He's not my real brother.

370
00:34:29,091 --> 00:34:33,053
My mom was divorced
by the time he was born.

371
00:34:42,188 --> 00:34:44,648
See? I'm not scared.

372
00:34:44,815 --> 00:34:47,692
- I never said you were.
- You bet, pet.

373
00:34:50,529 --> 00:34:55,784
But you wish you'd said it.
And now you're annoyed. You can't.

374
00:34:55,951 --> 00:34:58,620
I'm not talking to you anymore.

375
00:35:04,543 --> 00:35:07,212
Do you ever think about death?

376
00:35:07,797 --> 00:35:10,006
I do, all the time.

377
00:35:12,718 --> 00:35:13,718
What?

378
00:35:13,886 --> 00:35:16,554
Say something nice.

379
00:35:16,806 --> 00:35:18,014
Like what?

380
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:19,933
I don't know.

381
00:35:20,226 --> 00:35:22,227
Then neither do I.

382
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:27,565
I like your ashtray.

383
00:35:27,733 --> 00:35:29,651
It's Swiss.

384
00:35:29,985 --> 00:35:33,780
My granddad had a Rolls-Royce.
Great car!

385
00:35:33,948 --> 00:35:37,200
Never had to raise the hood
in 15 years!

386
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:42,038
Seen my new poster?

387
00:35:43,249 --> 00:35:45,083
Come here!

388
00:35:46,168 --> 00:35:48,670
Come here, for chrissake!

389
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:52,590
It won't do here. Where can I hang it?

390
00:35:55,344 --> 00:35:57,929
Why'd you slap me
when I looked at your legs?

391
00:35:58,097 --> 00:36:00,432
It wasn't my legs.

392
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,602
It's exactly the same thing.

393
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:09,774
The French always say things
are the same when they're not at all.

394
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:13,486
I've thought of something nice.

395
00:36:13,654 --> 00:36:15,155
What?

396
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:19,951
I want to sleep with you again
because you're beautiful.

397
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:22,537
I'm not.

398
00:36:22,705 --> 00:36:24,330
Then because you're ugly.

399
00:36:24,498 --> 00:36:26,374
Is it the same?

400
00:36:32,548 --> 00:36:34,799
Yeah, kid, it's the same.

401
00:36:34,967 --> 00:36:36,509
You're a liar, Michel.

402
00:36:36,677 --> 00:36:38,762
No, lying's stupid.

403
00:36:38,929 --> 00:36:42,348
It's like with poker.
It's better to tell the truth.

404
00:36:42,516 --> 00:36:46,770
The others think you're bluffing,
and that's how you win.

405
00:36:47,646 --> 00:36:48,646
What's wrong?

406
00:36:53,486 --> 00:36:56,529
I'll stare at you
until you stop staring at me.

407
00:36:56,697 --> 00:36:58,156
Me, too.

408
00:37:25,601 --> 00:37:28,895
I'll hang my poster in the bathroom.

409
00:37:30,189 --> 00:37:31,898
Can I make a call?

410
00:37:37,071 --> 00:37:38,613
It's not bad here.

411
00:37:38,781 --> 00:37:41,032
Just fine.

412
00:37:46,205 --> 00:37:48,248
You like this poster?

413
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:51,084
It's okay.

414
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,338
Renoir's a really great painter.

415
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:57,715
I said, it's okay!

416
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,886
Think she's prettier than me?

417
00:38:05,224 --> 00:38:10,061
When you're scared or surprised,
or both at once,

418
00:38:10,229 --> 00:38:12,105
there's a funny glint in your eyes.

419
00:38:12,273 --> 00:38:13,439
So what?

420
00:38:13,607 --> 00:38:17,443
I wanna sleep with you again,
because of that glint.

421
00:38:22,449 --> 00:38:24,909
Mind if I piss in the sink?

422
00:38:26,078 --> 00:38:27,912
Guess what I'm going to say.

423
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,081
No idea.

424
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:33,167
I'm pregnant, Michel.

425
00:38:37,131 --> 00:38:39,257
You heard me.

426
00:38:39,425 --> 00:38:40,925
Whose is it? Mine?

427
00:38:41,093 --> 00:38:43,094
I think so.

428
00:38:43,637 --> 00:38:45,346
Have you seen a doctor?

429
00:38:45,514 --> 00:38:47,432
Yesterday.

430
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,519
I have to go back Thursday
for the tests.

431
00:38:51,687 --> 00:38:54,022
You should've been more careful!

432
00:39:08,829 --> 00:39:12,332
Get me Élysées 99-84.

433
00:39:18,172 --> 00:39:20,256
Is Antonio there?

434
00:39:22,301 --> 00:39:25,178
You don't know if he's coming back?

435
00:39:26,221 --> 00:39:27,972
I'll call again.

436
00:39:38,484 --> 00:39:40,818
Élysées 25-32.

437
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:46,240
I'm calling the guy
who owes me money.

438
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:51,788
Mr. Tolmachoff, please.

439
00:39:53,832 --> 00:39:55,500
Hey, sonny.

440
00:39:59,672 --> 00:40:02,715
I couldn't find Berruti.

441
00:40:03,842 --> 00:40:07,011
I wandered
around Montparnasse all night.

442
00:40:10,349 --> 00:40:11,683
The police?

443
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,188
Thanks. Ciao, sonny.

444
00:40:20,025 --> 00:40:21,192
Shit!

445
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,569
- What?
- I slipped.

446
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:27,198
Heard the one
about the condemned man?

447
00:40:28,534 --> 00:40:33,913
As he's climbing the scaffold,
he slips and says, "That figures!"

448
00:40:39,878 --> 00:40:42,839
Up close, you look like a Martian.

449
00:40:43,215 --> 00:40:45,883
Because my head's in the clouds.

450
00:40:46,051 --> 00:40:48,052
Some idea, having a kid!

451
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,971
But it's not sure.

452
00:40:50,139 --> 00:40:52,390
I wanted to see what you'd say.

453
00:40:52,558 --> 00:40:55,560
- Take your clothes off.
- What for?

454
00:40:55,728 --> 00:40:57,729
You Americans are so dumb.

455
00:40:57,896 --> 00:40:59,272
I don't see why.

456
00:41:00,399 --> 00:41:03,109
You adore La Fayette
and Maurice Chevalier.

457
00:41:03,277 --> 00:41:06,738
And they're the dumbest French!

458
00:41:06,905 --> 00:41:09,282
I'm making another call.

459
00:41:11,493 --> 00:41:13,453
Belle Épine 35-26.

460
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,830
Patricia, come here!

461
00:41:19,752 --> 00:41:21,502
Mr. Mansard?

462
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:26,340
Will he be in this afternoon?
Tell him I'll come by.

463
00:41:27,801 --> 00:41:31,179
I'm a friend of Tony's.
From Marseilles.

464
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,974
I've got an American.

465
00:41:37,102 --> 00:41:38,102
An American?

466
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:40,063
László Kovács.

467
00:41:42,024 --> 00:41:47,737
Not you. My American car.

468
00:41:51,784 --> 00:41:56,120
I can't reach the guy
who owes me. What a drag!

469
00:41:56,705 --> 00:41:58,956
Do you prefer records or the radio?

470
00:41:59,124 --> 00:42:01,667
Quiet, I'm thinking.

471
00:42:19,144 --> 00:42:21,854
I know them all by heart.

472
00:42:22,356 --> 00:42:24,816
- How old are you?
- I'll put the radio on.

473
00:42:24,983 --> 00:42:26,484
I'm 20.

474
00:42:26,652 --> 00:42:28,611
You don't look it.

475
00:42:29,696 --> 00:42:31,989
Why don't you like music?

476
00:42:32,157 --> 00:42:34,200
It depends what kind.

477
00:42:34,493 --> 00:42:37,203
Come on, Patricia, come to Italy.

478
00:42:41,542 --> 00:42:45,211
What's the point of studying
at the Sorbonne?

479
00:42:45,379 --> 00:42:48,256
You never took any exams.

480
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:52,677
Sure, the baccalaureate.
Then I packed it in.

481
00:42:52,845 --> 00:42:54,595
What's "packed it in"?

482
00:42:54,763 --> 00:42:56,347
I did other stuff.

483
00:42:56,515 --> 00:42:57,640
Like what?

484
00:42:57,808 --> 00:42:59,100
I sold cars.

485
00:42:59,268 --> 00:43:01,060
Here, in Paris?

486
00:43:04,022 --> 00:43:05,857
In New York.

487
00:43:06,692 --> 00:43:09,694
You slept with a lot of guys?

488
00:43:09,862 --> 00:43:11,654
Not all that many.

489
00:43:13,949 --> 00:43:15,825
How many?

490
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:19,537
How about you?

491
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:25,084
Not so many either.

492
00:43:26,378 --> 00:43:30,339
Know where I'd like to live? Mexico.

493
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:32,383
I hear it's really great.

494
00:43:32,551 --> 00:43:37,013
When I was a kid my dad would say,
"We'll go next Saturday."

495
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:39,682
But he'd always forget.

496
00:43:41,977 --> 00:43:44,228
No, Mexico doesn't grab me.

497
00:43:44,396 --> 00:43:46,689
I bet it's not all that great.

498
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:49,233
People are such liars.

499
00:43:49,401 --> 00:43:52,403
It's like Stockholm. You keep hearing,

500
00:43:52,571 --> 00:43:57,700
"Swedish girls are terrific.
I laid three a day. Go."

501
00:43:57,868 --> 00:44:00,870
I went. It's not true.

502
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:04,540
Swedish girls don't act
the way they do here.

503
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:07,919
And most of them are dogs
like Parisian girls.

504
00:44:08,086 --> 00:44:11,297
No, Swedish girls are very pretty.

505
00:44:11,965 --> 00:44:14,634
It's a myth.

506
00:44:14,927 --> 00:44:21,265
One or two maybe, just like in Paris
or London, but not all of them.

507
00:44:21,433 --> 00:44:24,644
The cities where the girls are pretty,

508
00:44:24,811 --> 00:44:28,940
not gorgeous,
but like you, charming,

509
00:44:29,107 --> 00:44:33,277
girls who rate eight on a scale of 10,

510
00:44:33,445 --> 00:44:36,113
because they have a certain something...

511
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:43,579
aren't Rome or Paris or Rio,
but Lausanne and Geneva.

512
00:44:45,707 --> 00:44:48,125
Say something nice, too.

513
00:44:48,293 --> 00:44:50,962
I don't know what, either.

514
00:44:55,342 --> 00:44:59,178
Would you let another guy caress you?

515
00:45:02,307 --> 00:45:08,145
You know, you said I'm scared.
It's true, I'm scared.

516
00:45:08,313 --> 00:45:11,190
Because I want you to love me.

517
00:45:11,733 --> 00:45:16,988
But at the same time,
I want you to stop loving me.

518
00:45:17,155 --> 00:45:20,199
I'm very independent, you know.

519
00:45:22,911 --> 00:45:26,664
I love you, but not the way you think.

520
00:45:26,832 --> 00:45:28,416
Then how?

521
00:45:28,834 --> 00:45:29,875
Not the way you think.

522
00:45:30,043 --> 00:45:34,171
But you don't know what I think.
You don't know.

523
00:45:34,339 --> 00:45:37,633
- Sure I do.
- No. You can't.

524
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:42,221
I want to know what's behind your face.

525
00:45:43,849 --> 00:45:49,020
I've looked at it for 10 minutes now,
and I still know nothing, nothing.

526
00:45:49,187 --> 00:45:51,439
I'm not sad, but I'm scared.

527
00:45:53,525 --> 00:45:55,693
Sweet, gentle Patricia.

528
00:45:55,861 --> 00:46:02,366
Then mean, stupid, heartless,
pathetic, cowardly, despicable.

529
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:07,663
You don't even know
how to put on your lipstick.

530
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:09,373
Now you're hideous.

531
00:46:10,208 --> 00:46:12,710
Say what you like, I don't care.

532
00:46:12,878 --> 00:46:15,338
I'll put all this in my book.

533
00:46:15,505 --> 00:46:18,549
- What book?
- I'm writing a novel.

534
00:46:18,717 --> 00:46:21,260
- You?
- Why shouldn't I?

535
00:46:21,428 --> 00:46:22,720
What are you doing?

536
00:46:22,888 --> 00:46:24,221
Taking off your top.

537
00:46:24,389 --> 00:46:26,015
Not now.

538
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:29,560
You're a pain! What is all this?

539
00:46:30,604 --> 00:46:33,230
You know William Faulkner?

540
00:46:33,565 --> 00:46:36,609
No, who's he?
Someone you slept with?

541
00:46:36,777 --> 00:46:39,153
Hardly, sweetie pie.

542
00:46:39,321 --> 00:46:41,197
Then he can go to hell!

543
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:42,656
Take off your top.

544
00:46:42,824 --> 00:46:46,619
He's one of my favorite writers.
Have you read The Wild Palms?

545
00:46:46,787 --> 00:46:48,871
I said no! Take off your top.

546
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:53,084
Listen. The last sentence is beautiful.

547
00:47:04,096 --> 00:47:06,764
Which would you choose?

548
00:47:06,973 --> 00:47:08,516
Let me see your toes.

549
00:47:08,683 --> 00:47:11,936
Toes are important in a woman.
Don't laugh.

550
00:47:12,604 --> 00:47:14,230
Which would you choose?

551
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:16,774
Grief's stupid.

552
00:47:17,317 --> 00:47:19,068
I'd choose nothing.

553
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:20,945
It's not better...

554
00:47:21,696 --> 00:47:23,948
but grief's a compromise.

555
00:47:24,116 --> 00:47:25,950
I want all or nothing.

556
00:47:26,118 --> 00:47:28,244
And now I know.

557
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:32,456
That's it.
Why are you shutting your eyes?

558
00:47:32,624 --> 00:47:36,502
I'm shutting them tight
so everything goes black.

559
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:40,506
But I can't do it.
It's never entirely black.

560
00:47:40,674 --> 00:47:42,508
Your smile...

561
00:47:43,301 --> 00:47:46,929
seen in profile,
is the nicest thing about you.

562
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:48,973
That's you.

563
00:47:49,307 --> 00:47:50,975
That's me!

564
00:48:00,819 --> 00:48:05,156
We look each other in the eyes,
but what for?

565
00:48:09,911 --> 00:48:14,039
I hate that name.
I'd like to be called Ingrid.

566
00:48:16,168 --> 00:48:18,085
Sit on your haunches.

567
00:48:20,505 --> 00:48:22,298
What's wrong?

568
00:48:24,384 --> 00:48:26,260
I'm looking at you.

569
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,971
The French are stupid too.

570
00:48:37,272 --> 00:48:39,565
I want you to stay with me.

571
00:48:41,276 --> 00:48:47,573
We interrupt our programming
to synchronize our transceivers.

572
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:57,917
Funny... I can see myself in your eyes.

573
00:48:58,084 --> 00:49:01,253
This is Franco-American
rapprochement.

574
00:49:01,421 --> 00:49:03,964
We hide like happy elephants.

575
00:49:04,132 --> 00:49:05,758
A woman's hips are touching.

576
00:49:05,926 --> 00:49:08,010
It's hot under here.

577
00:49:21,316 --> 00:49:25,277
If it was another man caressing you,
would you mind?

578
00:49:25,445 --> 00:49:26,904
You asked me that.

579
00:49:27,072 --> 00:49:31,283
<i>And now it's time for
Music While You Work...</i>

580
00:49:52,097 --> 00:49:53,639
So that's that.

581
00:50:04,693 --> 00:50:10,114
Do you know a book by Dylan Thomas,
Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog?

582
00:50:12,951 --> 00:50:16,620
<i>On Sunday morning,
It's most satisfyin'</i>

583
00:50:16,788 --> 00:50:19,206
<i>To enjoy a long lie-in</i>

584
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:22,835
I'm getting dressed.

585
00:50:23,795 --> 00:50:24,878
What time is it?

586
00:50:25,046 --> 00:50:26,672
Noon.

587
00:50:27,299 --> 00:50:28,924
Was it good?

588
00:50:31,553 --> 00:50:32,970
Let's stay in bed.

589
00:50:33,138 --> 00:50:35,681
Nope, I have to buy a dress.

590
00:50:35,849 --> 00:50:37,016
Got your car?

591
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:39,685
My car? Sure.

592
00:50:52,824 --> 00:50:56,035
Élysées 99-84.

593
00:51:06,921 --> 00:51:09,089
Did Antonio come by?

594
00:51:13,011 --> 00:51:15,137
This is maddening!

595
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:18,140
You don't know where he is?

596
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:21,518
No, never mind.

597
00:51:22,854 --> 00:51:24,396
Michel Poiccard again.

598
00:51:24,564 --> 00:51:27,399
Want me to wear a bra?

599
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:39,495
Do you prefer my eyes,
my mouth or my shoulders?

600
00:51:41,081 --> 00:51:43,499
If you had to choose?

601
00:51:48,922 --> 00:51:51,048
There is no press conference?

602
00:51:51,257 --> 00:51:54,343
There is. At Orly airport.

603
00:51:55,261 --> 00:51:59,890
I'm not much of a looker,
but I'm quite a boxer.

604
00:52:03,895 --> 00:52:06,563
Going to your press conference?

605
00:52:06,815 --> 00:52:09,400
I have to drop by the office first.

606
00:52:09,567 --> 00:52:11,110
I'll come with you.

607
00:52:11,277 --> 00:52:13,404
<i>President Eisenhower,
with General De Gaulle,</i>

608
00:52:13,571 --> 00:52:17,491
<i>will lay a wreath
on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.</i>

609
00:52:17,659 --> 00:52:19,076
Were you in the army?

610
00:52:20,745 --> 00:52:23,122
What did you do?

611
00:52:23,748 --> 00:52:25,791
I bumped off sentries.

612
00:52:25,959 --> 00:52:27,251
"Bumped off"?

613
00:52:27,419 --> 00:52:28,919
I laid them out like this.

614
00:52:29,087 --> 00:52:31,088
Don't, Michel!

615
00:52:34,092 --> 00:52:37,594
I'm exhausted. I'm gonna die.

616
00:52:37,762 --> 00:52:39,596
You're crazy.

617
00:52:40,098 --> 00:52:42,641
Yeah, totally bonkers.

618
00:52:43,268 --> 00:52:44,810
What's "bonkers"?

619
00:52:44,978 --> 00:52:46,603
That's me.

620
00:53:06,332 --> 00:53:07,791
Your car's not here?

621
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:13,380
It's at the garage.
I'll go pick it up now.

622
00:53:36,988 --> 00:53:38,655
Swell, a Ford!

623
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,877
- What floor?
- Sixth.

624
00:54:11,689 --> 00:54:13,857
I got the wrong floor.

625
00:54:44,889 --> 00:54:48,809
- Are you scared of aging? I am.
- You dope!

626
00:54:52,021 --> 00:54:55,440
I told you,
the worst flaw is cowardice.

627
00:54:58,736 --> 00:55:00,529
Buy me a dress at Dior?

628
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:04,741
No way! There are
nicer ones at the five-and-ten.

629
00:55:04,909 --> 00:55:07,661
You don't buy dresses at Dior,
you make calls.

630
00:55:07,829 --> 00:55:10,455
It's the only place
where you can call for free.

631
00:55:10,623 --> 00:55:13,166
There are 12 phone booths.

632
00:55:13,334 --> 00:55:15,210
France-soir!

633
00:55:29,934 --> 00:55:31,768
Thank you, sir.

634
00:55:42,447 --> 00:55:45,282
POLICE KILLER STILL AT LARGE

635
00:56:29,869 --> 00:56:31,453
How long will it last?

636
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:33,246
Half an hour or so.

637
00:56:33,414 --> 00:56:35,916
I'll go see my man, then.

638
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:59,773
Why did you call your novel Candida?

639
00:57:01,859 --> 00:57:04,861
I'm convinced that the French
will give my book

640
00:57:05,029 --> 00:57:09,032
a cool reception
because of their prudishness.

641
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,201
Mr. Parvulesco!

642
00:57:14,122 --> 00:57:17,916
Can one still believe in love in our time?

643
00:57:18,876 --> 00:57:23,213
Of course, especially in our time.

644
00:57:24,549 --> 00:57:30,220
Was Rilke right to say, "Modern life will
increasingly separate men and women"?

645
00:57:31,389 --> 00:57:34,766
Rilke was a great poet,
so he was probably right.

646
00:57:37,729 --> 00:57:39,396
Out of my way!

647
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:42,482
You and your Pathé-Journal!

648
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:50,866
Are French women romantically
different from American women?

649
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:52,659
French women

650
00:57:52,827 --> 00:57:54,786
are totally unlike American women.

651
00:57:54,954 --> 00:57:56,872
The American woman
dominates the man.

652
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,750
The French woman
doesn't dominate him yet.

653
00:58:03,379 --> 00:58:05,505
What's your greatest ambition in life?

654
00:58:05,673 --> 00:58:09,760
Which is more moral: an unfaithful woman
or a man who walks out?

655
00:58:11,012 --> 00:58:12,721
An unfaithful woman.

656
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,600
Are women more sentimental
than men?

657
00:58:16,851 --> 00:58:20,437
Feelings are a luxury
few women indulge in.

658
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:27,861
Is there a difference
between eroticism and love?

659
00:58:30,323 --> 00:58:32,824
No, not really.

660
00:58:32,992 --> 00:58:36,036
I don't think so, because...

661
00:58:36,204 --> 00:58:39,664
eroticism is a form of love,
and vice versa.

662
00:58:40,166 --> 00:58:43,293
Does the soul exist in modern society?

663
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:52,969
Do women have a role to play
in modern society?

664
00:58:54,138 --> 00:58:58,475
If they're charming and wear
striped dresses and dark glasses.

665
00:58:58,643 --> 00:59:01,269
Casanova said that there's no woman

666
00:59:01,437 --> 00:59:04,064
who can't be seduced
with displays of gratitude.

667
00:59:04,232 --> 00:59:07,150
See Cocteau's
Testament of Orpheus.

668
00:59:07,318 --> 00:59:10,987
How many men can a woman
love in a lifetime?

669
00:59:11,155 --> 00:59:13,156
Physically, I mean.

670
00:59:18,329 --> 00:59:19,579
More than that.

671
00:59:20,832 --> 00:59:22,415
Miss, you're in the frame.

672
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:28,421
Two things matter in life. For men,
it's women, and for women, money.

673
00:59:28,589 --> 00:59:30,340
See? You are a pessimist.

674
00:59:30,633 --> 00:59:33,552
If you see a pretty girl
with a rich man, you know

675
00:59:33,719 --> 00:59:36,847
she's nice and he's a bastard.

676
00:59:41,435 --> 00:59:43,103
Do you like Brahms?

677
00:59:43,271 --> 00:59:44,563
Like everyone, no.

678
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:46,398
- And Chopin?
- Makes me want to puke!

679
00:59:47,817 --> 00:59:50,360
What's your greatest ambition?

680
00:59:54,365 --> 00:59:58,577
To become immortal, and then die.

681
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:43,747
You Claudius Mansard?

682
01:00:43,915 --> 01:00:45,832
Yes, Mr. Kovács.

683
01:00:47,084 --> 01:00:49,669
I called this morning.
I was told you'd be in.

684
01:00:49,837 --> 01:00:51,463
Yes, Mr. Kovács.

685
01:00:51,631 --> 01:00:53,715
Tony sent me.

686
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,802
Didn't we meet in Nice?

687
01:01:00,514 --> 01:01:01,806
Nobody phoned you?

688
01:01:01,974 --> 01:01:05,393
Yes. But they said
it'd be an Oldsmobile.

689
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:08,104
It fell through at the last minute.

690
01:01:08,272 --> 01:01:09,898
So?

691
01:01:10,358 --> 01:01:12,359
So it's this one.

692
01:01:24,538 --> 01:01:26,289
800,000.

693
01:01:29,126 --> 01:01:32,545
But I can't pay you till next week.

694
01:01:32,964 --> 01:01:34,172
You're a bastard!

695
01:01:35,383 --> 01:01:39,219
And you, Mr. Kovács? What are you?

696
01:01:41,389 --> 01:01:42,931
So what?

697
01:01:43,808 --> 01:01:46,142
So you don't get the money now.

698
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:49,729
- Tough. Is it 3:00 yet?
- Quarter past.

699
01:01:49,897 --> 01:01:51,940
Can I use your phone?

700
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,418
- Is Antonio there?
- He just left.

701
01:02:12,336 --> 01:02:13,378
Goddammit!

702
01:02:13,546 --> 01:02:16,381
He said to meet him at L'Escale at 4:00.

703
01:02:16,549 --> 01:02:20,552
Four o'clock at L'Escale. Okay, thanks.

704
01:02:23,723 --> 01:02:26,558
Don't bother. I carry my cash on me.

705
01:02:26,851 --> 01:02:28,852
Lend me 10,000.

706
01:02:31,689 --> 01:02:32,689
5,000.

707
01:02:34,358 --> 01:02:36,067
2,500.

708
01:02:42,033 --> 01:02:43,867
It's not running?

709
01:02:46,537 --> 01:02:48,330
Hey, you!

710
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:52,167
You remove the distributor cap?

711
01:02:55,546 --> 01:02:56,963
Pay for the call!

712
01:02:57,131 --> 01:02:58,715
Pay for my taxi!

713
01:03:00,718 --> 01:03:02,469
Step on it! Step on it!

714
01:03:02,636 --> 01:03:05,764
Never mind the pedestrians!
Just move it!

715
01:03:05,931 --> 01:03:08,558
Step on it, for chrissake!

716
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:14,272
The Thunderbird's fender torn off!
Me, not a scratch!

717
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,109
That's where I was born.

718
01:03:18,277 --> 01:03:21,404
Look at the eyesore
they built opposite!

719
01:03:22,782 --> 01:03:26,910
Buildings like that get me down.
They ruin the block.

720
01:03:27,745 --> 01:03:32,332
I have a feeling for beauty, beautiful.

721
01:03:33,292 --> 01:03:36,544
Go through Chatelet.
It's your fault if we're late.

722
01:03:36,712 --> 01:03:38,254
No, it isn't.

723
01:03:38,422 --> 01:03:40,298
Pass that Peugeot!

724
01:03:40,466 --> 01:03:41,841
Don't shift gears!

725
01:03:42,009 --> 01:03:47,472
Braking for a 4CV!
That scooter just passed you!

726
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,808
Take the next left.

727
01:03:50,643 --> 01:03:51,976
Stop here. Be right back.

728
01:04:22,091 --> 01:04:24,050
He left five minutes ago.

729
01:04:24,218 --> 01:04:26,761
The friend who owes you money?

730
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:30,765
Antonio Berruti, yeah. It's your fault.

731
01:04:31,225 --> 01:04:33,268
Now it's double or nothing.

732
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:35,812
- Why?
- Later.

733
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:37,981
Pass that 2CV, pops.

734
01:04:38,149 --> 01:04:40,692
- Where you going?
- To the Herald.

735
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:42,277
Eyes on the road!

736
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:43,862
Why bother writing?

737
01:04:44,029 --> 01:04:47,574
To have money and not rely on men.

738
01:04:47,741 --> 01:04:51,244
Parisians look like tarts
in those short dresses.

739
01:04:51,412 --> 01:04:55,165
Makes me wanna run up behind them
and do like this...

740
01:04:55,332 --> 01:04:57,375
Don't mind me!

741
01:04:57,543 --> 01:04:58,793
Stop here!

742
01:05:07,511 --> 01:05:09,804
- Be right back.
- Okay.

743
01:05:09,972 --> 01:05:12,098
- Not paying?
- Quick!

744
01:05:18,606 --> 01:05:22,942
- Where are we going?
- The Champs-Élysées.

745
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:26,696
I hate cabbies who worry
about scratching the bodywork.

746
01:05:27,198 --> 01:05:29,532
The Gestapo put up a wall here

747
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:31,784
so nobody could get away.

748
01:05:31,952 --> 01:05:34,329
I've been thinking about that girl.

749
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:35,622
What girl?

750
01:05:35,789 --> 01:05:39,083
The one with that guy on the Riviera.

751
01:05:39,251 --> 01:05:41,628
You said you admired her.

752
01:05:41,795 --> 01:05:45,548
Yeah, a normal girl. That's rare.

753
01:05:48,385 --> 01:05:50,303
Come with me to the paper?

754
01:05:50,471 --> 01:05:52,222
No, I have a call to make.

755
01:05:52,389 --> 01:05:55,558
I'm going to see my tailor.
I'll pick you up later.

756
01:05:55,726 --> 01:05:57,644
Ciao, kiddo!

757
01:06:17,289 --> 01:06:19,582
You're late. They're waiting.

758
01:06:49,446 --> 01:06:51,656
Over there.

759
01:07:09,717 --> 01:07:11,050
You speak French?

760
01:07:11,677 --> 01:07:13,886
You know this man?

761
01:07:31,989 --> 01:07:36,159
Careful, kid.
You can't fool the Paris police.

762
01:07:36,327 --> 01:07:38,077
Yes, it's Michel.

763
01:07:39,538 --> 01:07:43,499
I didn't recognize him.
It's an old photo.

764
01:07:43,792 --> 01:07:47,962
You were seen with him
this morning just outside.

765
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:49,130
Who saw me?

766
01:07:49,298 --> 01:07:53,843
He was driving
a Ford Thunderbird 3382 GM75.

767
01:07:55,846 --> 01:07:57,096
Where is he now?

768
01:07:57,264 --> 01:07:59,349
I don't know.

769
01:08:00,351 --> 01:08:04,145
Watch what you say, kid.

770
01:08:04,313 --> 01:08:06,773
I've seen him five or six times.

771
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:11,903
I found him nice. I don't know
where he lives or what he does.

772
01:08:12,488 --> 01:08:14,906
Known him long?

773
01:08:15,866 --> 01:08:20,203
I met him in Nice last month.
I was on vacation.

774
01:08:20,371 --> 01:08:24,207
He came to Paris to see someone
who owes him money.

775
01:08:24,375 --> 01:08:25,375
Who?

776
01:08:25,542 --> 01:08:28,711
I don't know.
He had an Italian name.

777
01:08:30,381 --> 01:08:32,965
Think you'll see him again?

778
01:08:33,133 --> 01:08:39,222
Maybe. Sometimes he calls me
and asks me out. Like this morning.

779
01:08:43,227 --> 01:08:44,936
Got a work permit?

780
01:08:46,063 --> 01:08:48,439
You don't want any passport problems?

781
01:08:48,607 --> 01:08:49,607
No, I don't.

782
01:08:49,775 --> 01:08:53,277
So if you see him, here's my number.

783
01:08:56,115 --> 01:08:59,742
Danton 01-00.

784
01:11:46,326 --> 01:11:50,788
<i>President Eisenhower
is waving to the crowds...</i>

785
01:11:55,586 --> 01:11:59,088
Was that what you meant
by double or nothing?

786
01:12:00,591 --> 01:12:02,216
More or less.

787
01:12:02,384 --> 01:12:04,135
Let's go see a Western.

788
01:12:04,303 --> 01:12:07,138
Yeah, better wait till dark.

789
01:12:19,735 --> 01:12:21,485
<i>Beware, Jessica</i>

790
01:12:21,653 --> 01:12:24,071
<i>On the kiss's beveled edge
Time is a void</i>

791
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:27,950
<i>Avoid, avoid
Memory's broken pledge</i>

792
01:12:31,079 --> 01:12:32,747
<i>You're wrong, sheriff</i>

793
01:12:32,915 --> 01:12:36,208
<i>Your tale is noble and tragic
Like the mask of a tyrant</i>

794
01:12:36,376 --> 01:12:41,047
<i>No drama so perilous or magnetic
No detail can make our love pathetic</i>

795
01:12:50,849 --> 01:12:52,558
Hey, cutie!

796
01:12:59,691 --> 01:13:07,031
POLICE CLOSING IN ON MICHEL POICCARD...

797
01:13:07,699 --> 01:13:09,909
- What's it say?
- I'm reading it.

798
01:13:10,077 --> 01:13:12,161
The cops are stupid to be after me.

799
01:13:12,329 --> 01:13:15,414
I'm one of the few people
who likes cops.

800
01:13:18,168 --> 01:13:20,211
Let me caress you.

801
01:13:21,213 --> 01:13:22,338
Say something!

802
01:13:22,506 --> 01:13:24,548
- Wow!
- What?

803
01:13:24,716 --> 01:13:27,343
- So you're married.
- Show me.

804
01:13:31,056 --> 01:13:33,099
That was ages ago.

805
01:13:33,266 --> 01:13:35,851
She was a wacko. She dumped me.

806
01:13:36,019 --> 01:13:37,937
Or I dumped her. Don't remember.

807
01:13:38,105 --> 01:13:40,690
I'm really fond of you.

808
01:13:40,857 --> 01:13:43,859
What's it feel like,
riding in a stolen car?

809
01:13:44,027 --> 01:13:46,904
- And killing a policeman?
- I was scared.

810
01:13:47,072 --> 01:13:49,281
How did they know I knew you?

811
01:13:49,449 --> 01:13:53,285
Someone must've seen us together
and informed on us.

812
01:13:53,787 --> 01:13:55,830
- That's horrible.
- What is?

813
01:13:55,998 --> 01:13:58,082
Informing on people.

814
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:01,419
No, it's normal. Informers inform,

815
01:14:01,586 --> 01:14:03,087
burglars burgle,

816
01:14:03,255 --> 01:14:07,633
murderers murder, lovers love.

817
01:14:10,512 --> 01:14:13,597
Look, isn't the Concorde gorgeous!

818
01:14:15,225 --> 01:14:19,020
Yes, mysterious, with all the lights.

819
01:14:19,187 --> 01:14:22,982
I was a fool to keep this car.
Gotta switch.

820
01:14:23,150 --> 01:14:25,151
- What?
- Switch cars.

821
01:14:39,666 --> 01:14:41,500
Let's steal the Cadillac?

822
01:14:45,005 --> 01:14:46,005
What about the keys?

823
01:14:46,173 --> 01:14:50,426
You drive, I hide.
They leave the keys in the car here.

824
01:14:55,599 --> 01:14:59,060
- What do I tell the man?
- Say good night, in English.

825
01:14:59,227 --> 01:15:02,938
That'll shut him up.
The French are yellow-bellied.

826
01:15:03,106 --> 01:15:04,398
"Yellow-bellied"?

827
01:15:04,566 --> 01:15:07,276
Scared stiff. You scared?

828
01:15:07,444 --> 01:15:10,446
It's too late to be scared.

829
01:15:22,292 --> 01:15:27,254
MICHEL POICCARD: ARREST IMMINENT

830
01:15:35,806 --> 01:15:38,808
I just gotta find Antonio.

831
01:15:38,975 --> 01:15:42,478
Once you look for someone,
you never find him.

832
01:15:47,067 --> 01:15:48,526
Who was that?

833
01:15:49,444 --> 01:15:51,654
- Step on it, poppet.
- What's "poppet"?

834
01:16:12,384 --> 01:16:14,093
Have you seen Antonio?

835
01:16:14,261 --> 01:16:16,679
I'll tell you if I can kiss her.

836
01:16:17,597 --> 01:16:19,682
It's not up to me.

837
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:22,351
It's up to her.

838
01:16:26,106 --> 01:16:28,691
He's with Zumbach.

839
01:16:31,194 --> 01:16:32,653
Carl!

840
01:16:36,867 --> 01:16:40,286
- How's life?
- The same. Antonio here?

841
01:16:40,453 --> 01:16:43,038
There he is.

842
01:16:45,375 --> 01:16:47,042
- Who is he?
- Who? Antonio?

843
01:16:47,210 --> 01:16:48,169
No, the other one.

844
01:16:52,674 --> 01:16:54,592
Let's see those socks.

845
01:16:54,759 --> 01:16:57,178
Silk socks with a tweed jacket!

846
01:16:57,345 --> 01:16:59,930
- I like silk.
- Not with tweed!

847
01:17:02,517 --> 01:17:03,893
- Hey, amigo.
- Hey, sonny.

848
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:05,603
I'll be off.

849
01:17:06,229 --> 01:17:09,648
You been looking for me?
You called several times.

850
01:17:09,816 --> 01:17:13,402
Yeah, I'm in the shit. Goddammit!

851
01:17:14,237 --> 01:17:15,946
Got a minute?

852
01:17:16,114 --> 01:17:17,865
- See that guy?
- What do I say?

853
01:17:18,033 --> 01:17:19,575
Anything you want.

854
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:21,744
I'll just be a sec.

855
01:17:22,162 --> 01:17:26,081
- What will they do?
- Take photos of her kissing the guy.

856
01:17:26,249 --> 01:17:29,501
- What for?
- Blackmail, probably.

857
01:17:49,189 --> 01:17:50,940
Be right back.

858
01:17:52,234 --> 01:17:53,525
Who's the chick?

859
01:17:53,693 --> 01:17:56,904
- To make things worse, I love her.
- Damn!

860
01:18:17,801 --> 01:18:20,094
1.3 million. Can do.

861
01:18:20,595 --> 01:18:22,096
What's the bank?

862
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:24,473
- B.N.C.I.
- Let me see.

863
01:18:27,519 --> 01:18:28,769
What do we do?

864
01:18:28,937 --> 01:18:30,437
Don't know.

865
01:18:30,605 --> 01:18:33,649
- Where can I reach you tomorrow?
- Don't know.

866
01:18:33,817 --> 01:18:36,819
The hotels are crawling with
goddamn tourists.

867
01:18:36,987 --> 01:18:39,488
My friend in Montmartre
has a big place.

868
01:18:39,656 --> 01:18:42,992
- Not Montmartre.
- Not Montmartre, he says.

869
01:18:43,159 --> 01:18:44,535
Why not?

870
01:18:44,703 --> 01:18:47,329
Too many enemies in Montmartre.

871
01:18:47,664 --> 01:18:49,665
Try Zumbach's Swedish girl.

872
01:18:49,833 --> 01:18:52,668
Rue Campagne-Première?

873
01:18:52,836 --> 01:18:54,878
Call me there tomorrow.

874
01:19:12,605 --> 01:19:15,024
Antonio said we could sleep here.

875
01:19:15,191 --> 01:19:19,069
Sure. Sit down.
I'll be right with you.

876
01:19:24,701 --> 01:19:26,201
Smile!

877
01:19:29,205 --> 01:19:30,956
Why not pose? Pay's good.

878
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:33,542
You have to sleep around.

879
01:19:34,502 --> 01:19:36,337
I was just thinking...

880
01:19:36,504 --> 01:19:39,340
- What?
- I'm not sure.

881
01:19:39,507 --> 01:19:41,258
About?

882
01:19:41,426 --> 01:19:45,346
I don't know. Otherwise I'd be sure.

883
01:19:51,811 --> 01:19:54,396
You dump your journalist?

884
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:56,732
Why'd you say hello?

885
01:19:57,192 --> 01:19:59,985
To make sure
I didn't love him anymore.

886
01:20:00,153 --> 01:20:02,404
You complicate your life.

887
01:20:02,864 --> 01:20:05,574
That's it.
Drop me on the Champs-Élysées?

888
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:24,093
What are you playing?

889
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:29,098
The "Clarinet Concerto" by Mozart.
Do you mind?

890
01:20:29,265 --> 01:20:30,849
No, I like that one.

891
01:20:31,017 --> 01:20:33,769
I thought you didn't like music.

892
01:20:33,937 --> 01:20:37,356
This one's okay.
My dad was a clarinetist.

893
01:20:38,274 --> 01:20:41,443
My dad was a great clarinet player.

894
01:20:42,112 --> 01:20:44,279
Want to go to bed?

895
01:20:44,447 --> 01:20:46,448
Sleeping's so sad.

896
01:20:46,616 --> 01:20:48,200
We have to separ.

897
01:20:48,368 --> 01:20:51,328
- ...ate.
- "Separate."

898
01:20:52,372 --> 01:20:55,499
You say "sleep together," but you don't.

899
01:21:08,138 --> 01:21:10,180
What is it?

900
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:15,894
Nothing.

901
01:21:20,275 --> 01:21:21,900
Come here.

902
01:21:30,994 --> 01:21:33,787
Go buy a France-soir
and a bottle of milk.

903
01:21:41,588 --> 01:21:43,338
What time is it?

904
01:21:43,673 --> 01:21:45,382
Five o'clock.

905
01:21:50,430 --> 01:21:52,473
Still busy.

906
01:22:00,523 --> 01:22:02,524
- What?
- Nothing.

907
01:22:02,692 --> 01:22:04,151
France-soir!

908
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:06,278
I'm looking at you.

909
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:14,536
It's your lucky day. Buy a ticket.

910
01:22:14,704 --> 01:22:16,205
- A Scotch.
- Don't have any.

911
01:22:16,372 --> 01:22:18,165
Make it coffee.

912
01:22:22,122 --> 01:22:24,915
Danton 01-00?

913
01:22:26,758 --> 01:22:29,718
Inspector Vital, please.

914
01:22:37,727 --> 01:22:40,145
Patricia Franchini.

915
01:22:40,605 --> 01:22:45,067
I've just seen the man
you've been looking for.

916
01:22:45,401 --> 01:22:48,987
He's at 11, rue Première-Campagne.

917
01:22:50,406 --> 01:22:53,242
Yes. 11, rue Campagne-Première.

918
01:23:48,798 --> 01:23:50,048
Thirsty?

919
01:23:51,634 --> 01:23:55,137
Antonio's coming. He just called.

920
01:23:55,305 --> 01:23:57,931
We're going to Italy, kid.

921
01:24:00,351 --> 01:24:01,685
I can't go.

922
01:24:01,853 --> 01:24:04,104
Sure you can. I'm taking you.

923
01:24:04,355 --> 01:24:07,065
Berruti's lending me his Simca Sport.

924
01:24:07,567 --> 01:24:12,571
- A Gordini engine.
- Michel, I called the police.

925
01:24:13,323 --> 01:24:14,656
I said you were here.

926
01:24:14,824 --> 01:24:17,492
What! Are you crazy?

927
01:24:17,910 --> 01:24:20,537
No, I'm fine.

928
01:24:22,165 --> 01:24:24,249
No, I'm not fine.

929
01:24:24,417 --> 01:24:27,336
I don't want to go away
with you now.

930
01:24:27,670 --> 01:24:29,296
I knew it.

931
01:24:30,006 --> 01:24:31,006
I don't know.

932
01:24:31,174 --> 01:24:34,635
I just talked about myself,
and you, yourself.

933
01:24:34,802 --> 01:24:36,178
I'm so stupid.

934
01:24:36,346 --> 01:24:40,182
You should've talked about me,
and me, about you.

935
01:24:40,350 --> 01:24:43,310
I don't want to be in love with you.

936
01:24:44,937 --> 01:24:47,856
That's why I called the police.

937
01:24:49,067 --> 01:24:54,363
I stayed with you
to make sure I was in love with you.

938
01:24:54,530 --> 01:24:57,407
Or that I wasn't.

939
01:24:59,702 --> 01:25:02,871
And since I'm being mean to you,

940
01:25:03,039 --> 01:25:05,874
it proves I'm not in love with you.

941
01:25:06,042 --> 01:25:07,793
Say that again!

942
01:25:08,211 --> 01:25:11,922
And since I'm being mean to you,

943
01:25:12,090 --> 01:25:15,425
it proves I'm not in love with you.

944
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:19,429
They say there's no happy love.

945
01:25:20,098 --> 01:25:21,973
If I loved you...

946
01:25:23,226 --> 01:25:24,935
It's too complicated!

947
01:25:25,103 --> 01:25:28,897
On the contrary, there's no unhappy love.

948
01:25:29,899 --> 01:25:32,901
I want people to let me be.

949
01:25:33,403 --> 01:25:35,112
I'm independent.

950
01:25:35,279 --> 01:25:39,408
- Maybe you love me.
- You think you are. You're not.

951
01:25:39,575 --> 01:25:41,785
That's why I turned you in.

952
01:25:41,953 --> 01:25:44,329
I'm better than you are.

953
01:25:45,123 --> 01:25:48,083
Now you have no choice but to go.

954
01:25:49,669 --> 01:25:51,712
You're crazy!

955
01:25:52,964 --> 01:25:56,049
That's a pathetic argument.

956
01:26:02,932 --> 01:26:06,059
You're like the girl
who sleeps with everyone...

957
01:26:07,103 --> 01:26:10,522
except the one man who loves her...

958
01:26:11,899 --> 01:26:15,026
saying it's because she sleeps
with everyone.

959
01:26:17,697 --> 01:26:20,115
Why don't you go?

960
01:26:22,827 --> 01:26:27,080
I've slept with lots of men.
Don't count on me.

961
01:26:28,624 --> 01:26:30,959
What are you waiting for?

962
01:26:31,127 --> 01:26:33,503
No, I'm staying. I'm in bad shape.

963
01:26:33,671 --> 01:26:36,131
I prefer prison.

964
01:26:36,299 --> 01:26:38,133
You're mad!

965
01:26:42,472 --> 01:26:44,806
Nobody'll talk to me.

966
01:26:45,475 --> 01:26:47,184
I can look at the walls.

967
01:26:48,644 --> 01:26:50,020
Damn, Berruti!

968
01:26:51,647 --> 01:26:54,274
Hey, amigo! I'll just park.

969
01:26:57,570 --> 01:26:59,571
- The cops are coming.
- Your money!

970
01:26:59,739 --> 01:27:02,115
The American girl turned me in.

971
01:27:02,283 --> 01:27:04,075
- Get in!
- No, you go!

972
01:27:04,243 --> 01:27:07,621
- Get in!
- No, I'm staying.

973
01:27:10,666 --> 01:27:12,834
I'm fed up.

974
01:27:13,044 --> 01:27:14,586
I'm tired.

975
01:27:14,754 --> 01:27:16,171
I want to sleep.

976
01:27:16,339 --> 01:27:17,839
You're nuts!

977
01:27:18,007 --> 01:27:20,634
Damn the police. I'll save my neck.

978
01:27:21,677 --> 01:27:26,264
I shouldn't be thinking of her,
but I can't help it.

979
01:27:26,599 --> 01:27:28,642
Want my pistol?

980
01:27:31,687 --> 01:27:34,064
- Don't be stupid!
- Get lost!

981
01:29:37,146 --> 01:29:39,564
Makes me want to puke.

982
01:29:52,119 --> 01:29:53,495
What did he say?

983
01:29:53,563 --> 01:29:56,898
He said you make him want to puke.

984
01:30:01,696 --> 01:30:04,447
What's that mean, "puke"?
