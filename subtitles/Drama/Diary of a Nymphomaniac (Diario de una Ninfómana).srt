628 Tremont.
6-2-8, three Dead.

2
00:00:36,396 --> 00:00:39,280
- Not here.
- The fuckin' usual.

3
00:00:39,281 --> 00:00:42,070
So no big deal these days, right?
Some guy, what's his name?

4
00:00:42,071 --> 00:00:43,754
- Uh, I don't know.
- Who knows, who cares.

5
00:00:43,755 --> 00:00:44,956
Who cares.

6
00:00:44,957 --> 00:00:45,956
Fuckin'.

7
00:00:45,957 --> 00:00:48,900
Shoots his wife and kid,
and eats the fuckin' licorice.

8
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:52,844
Sticks it in his mouth
and blows his fuckin' brains out.

9
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:56,788
This guy has no ID,
no fuckin' papers.

10
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,904
He probably squirreled over
the goddamn border.

11
00:00:58,905 --> 00:01:00,347
Hey guys.
Channel 13.

12
00:01:00,348 --> 00:01:03,329
Listen up, you're kind of blocking the shot,
can I get you to move forward a bit?

13
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,157
- Yeah sure.
- Thanks.

14
00:01:05,158 --> 00:01:06,984
- You Ready?
- Yeah, almost.

15
00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:09,485
Two minutes.
and we'll roll.

16
00:01:10,256 --> 00:01:13,141
- Can't get close enough for an Emmy.
- Screw the Emmy!

17
00:01:13,142 --> 00:01:15,738
- Settle for a fuckin' paycheck.
- Story of my life.

18
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:19,393
<i>We downloaded this video off the internet
sometime over the last three days,</i>

19
00:01:19,394 --> 00:01:21,413
<i>I can't remember
exactly when.</i>

20
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,876
Look at this guy.
Look at this fuckin' guy!

21
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:28,339
Chowing down while his buddies are
shoving a corpse in the back of the van.

22
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,744
<i>Some of this footage
was never broadcast.</i>

23
00:01:30,745 --> 00:01:33,534
<i>It was secretly uploaded by
the cameraman who shot it.</i>

24
00:01:33,535 --> 00:01:37,959
<i>It was his way of trying to tell the truth
about what was happening.</i>

25
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,172
Bree Reno, reporting live
from Homestead,

26
00:01:40,173 --> 00:01:42,672
where tragedy be-felled
an immigrant family.

27
00:01:42,673 --> 00:01:47,097
An unidentified man has shot his
wife and 16 year old son to death

28
00:01:47,098 --> 00:01:49,823
before turning the
gun on himself.

29
00:01:49,888 --> 00:01:51,963
- Jesus!
- What?

30
00:01:52,052 --> 00:01:53,219
- I don't believe this!
- What?

31
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,813
Is there something wrong with
the camera, just fix it!

32
00:01:55,067 --> 00:01:56,315
She's still moving!

33
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,386
For Christ sake, Willy,
I'm right in the middle of...

34
00:01:58,545 --> 00:02:00,895
- What?
- Jesus fuckin' Christ!

35
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,300
For god's sake!

36
00:02:02,585 --> 00:02:05,470
- I thought they were dead.
- They're supposed to be, they are!

37
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:08,164
I don't know, she's moving on
the freakin' gurney man!

38
00:02:08,165 --> 00:02:12,765
- Get out of the way, come on.
- I need some backup here.

39
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:15,717
Get off of him!

40
00:02:16,726 --> 00:02:19,803
- Are you all right?
- Jesus, what the fuck was that?

41
00:02:19,804 --> 00:02:24,104
- Keep still.
- The other ones moving!

42
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,511
Another one coming up too.

43
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:33,321
Take them out!

44
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,895
He's not going down.
He's not going down!

45
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,788
Holy shit!

46
00:02:47,412 --> 00:02:48,712
Freeze!

47
00:02:49,047 --> 00:02:50,790
You must shoot
them in the head!

48
00:02:53,087 --> 00:02:56,562
No! No!
This can't be happening!

49
00:02:57,031 --> 00:02:59,881
This can't be fuckin' happening!

50
00:03:02,418 --> 00:03:06,650
<i>We downloaded a lot of what we found

over those first few days.</i>

52
00:03:09,777 --> 00:03:13,383
<i>Most of it was bullshit.
None of it was useful.</i>

53
00:03:13,384 --> 00:03:15,980
<i>This is what we were getting
from the news networks.</i>

<i>None of us can

<i>what has caused the chaos,
that we've stand from experience.</i>

56
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,600
<i>A natural calamity or sort of
a massive or monstrous hoax?</i>

57

58

<i>'War of the World's,' possibly the
greatest hoax ever perpetrated.</i>

59
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:34,450
<i>That was just radio.
Now, it’s 24/7.</i>

60
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:36,209
<i>This is some kind of...</i>

61
00:03:39,357 --> 00:03:41,857
<i>we are led to believe
almost anything...</i>

62
00:03:41,858 --> 00:03:45,512
<i>We made a film,
the one I'm going to show you now.</i>

63
00:03:45,513 --> 00:03:49,938
<i>Actually, Jason was the
one who wanted to make it.</i>

64
00:03:49,973 --> 00:03:52,197
<i>Like that camera man
from Channel 13,</i>

65
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:57,440
<i>He wanted to upload it so that people,
you, could be told the truth.</i>

66
00:03:57,441 --> 00:04:02,778
<i>The film was shot with a
Panasonic HDX-900-and a HVX-200.</i>

67
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,520
<i>I did the final cut
on Jason's laptop.</i>

68
00:04:05,521 --> 00:04:10,330
<i>I've added music occasionally
for effects, hoping to scare you.</i>

69
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:12,975
<i>You see, in addition to
trying to tell you the truth</i>

70
00:04:12,976 --> 00:04:15,535
<i>I am hoping to scare you,</i>

71
00:04:15,536 --> 00:04:18,327
<i>so that maybe
you'll wake up.</i>

72
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:22,643
<i>Maybe you won't make any of
the same mistakes that we made.</i>

73
00:04:22,644 --> 00:04:24,419

<i>Jason Creed: The Death of Death.</i>

75
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:58,920
No!
Cut! Cut!

76
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:03,718
How many times have I told you
that these things don't move fast?

77
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:04,982
You're a corpse,
for Christ sake!

78
00:05:04,983 --> 00:05:07,787
If you run that fast,
your ankles are gonna snap off.

79
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:11,413
She's going fast, I have to go fast,
otherwise how am I supposed to catch her?

80
00:05:11,414 --> 00:05:15,165
You're supposed to catch her later.
This is the beginning of the fuckin' movie.

81
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,848
You catch her now,
it's all over.

82
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:19,528
All you're supposed to do
is grab her dress, till...

83
00:05:19,529 --> 00:05:21,861
...till my tits fall out?
Ain't gonna happen!

84
00:05:21,862 --> 00:05:23,785
You know, can somebody
please explain to me

85
00:05:23,786 --> 00:05:29,173
why girls in scary movies always have to
fall down and lose their shoes and shit?

86
00:05:29,174 --> 00:05:31,164
It's totally lame.

87
00:05:31,647 --> 00:05:33,514
And why do we do have to get
our dresses torn off?

88
00:05:33,515 --> 00:05:35,259
Actually, I'm looking
forward to that part.

89
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,849
- Flashing!
- I swear...

90
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,398
Thanks.

91
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:41,729
Ah shit man, look at this,
your makeup is all unglued.

92
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,521
Give me a break!

93
00:05:43,606 --> 00:05:46,492
Yeah, maybe you can see now,
because you're in way too tight.

94
00:05:46,493 --> 00:05:48,826
All you're supposed to do
is run into the fuckin' shot.

95
00:05:48,827 --> 00:05:50,826
No, not run...
shamble.

96
00:05:50,827 --> 00:05:54,056
The script says the mummy
shambles into the frame and stops

97
00:05:54,057 --> 00:05:56,039
for a second...
for one second.

98
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,957
You're telling me in one second you can see...
- The camera can see

99
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,250
and what the camera sees,
the audience will see.

100
00:06:00,251 --> 00:06:01,934
What fuckin' audience?

101
00:06:01,935 --> 00:06:05,379
There's always an audience for horror,
believable horror.

102
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,294
But who's gonna believe a mummy
if his makeup is all unglued?

103
00:06:08,295 --> 00:06:10,352
Who's gonna believe a
mummy in the first place?

104
00:06:10,353 --> 00:06:11,429
Here's a thought, genius.

105
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,624
Try zooming out, maybe
your fuckin' shot will work.

106
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,318
I know what I want here, Tony,
and I know what I'm doing.

107
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,050
That's right, you do,
don't ya?

108
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:22,091
We're only what, four days over
a three day shooting schedule?

109
00:06:22,092 --> 00:06:25,458
Great, you're doing fine.
I hope we'll get fuckin' credits.

110
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:29,442
- You'll all be in the credits.
- Talking about college credits.

111
00:06:29,474 --> 00:06:30,862
Leave those to me.

112
00:06:31,905 --> 00:06:34,790
- Did we get the shot yet?
- No, we're still dickin' around.

113
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:38,748
Five credits for the each of you,
that's a pledge.

114
00:06:39,217 --> 00:06:42,067
Mr. Creed has a vision.

115
00:06:42,104 --> 00:06:44,549
Hey, I'm just trying to
make a scary movie here.

116
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,673
Yes, you are,
Mr. Creed.

117
00:06:45,674 --> 00:06:48,357
<i>Jason always wanted to
be a documentary filmmaker,</i>

118
00:06:48,358 --> 00:06:50,269
<i>but for his senior class project,</i>

119
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:53,117
<i>he decided to try to make
a horror film instead.</i>

120
00:06:53,644 --> 00:06:55,958
<i>In fact, that's what he was
shooting on that first night.</i>

121
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,882
<i>The night, when...</i>

122
00:06:57,883 --> 00:06:59,662
<i>everything changed.</i>

123
00:06:59,663 --> 00:07:01,731
Stupid fuckin'
horror movie.

124
00:07:01,732 --> 00:07:04,329
With an underlying
thread of social satire.

125
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,157
Jason, can I
take a minute?

126
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:08,321
- I have to pee.
- Oh shit. Alright.

127
00:07:08,322 --> 00:07:10,198
- Jason...
- What?

128
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,130
I have to pee, too.

129
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:14,835
Jesus Christ, this whole
thing is falling apart.

130
00:07:14,836 --> 00:07:18,857
Hey guys, uh, there's something
on the news. It's pretty...

131
00:07:18,858 --> 00:07:22,090
well, I mean...
you might want to check this out.

132
00:07:24,739 --> 00:07:25,899
<i>...but it does seem to happening.</i>

133
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,752
<i>Two news agencies in two separate
counties in the tri-state area</i>

<i>are reporting accounts
of the dead returning to life.</i>

135
00:07:32,904 --> 00:07:36,585
<i>In one of the cases, the one
in Summerset, the dead man,</i>

136
00:07:36,586 --> 00:07:39,597
<i>identified as a
50 year old white male,</i>

137
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:41,946
<i>the victim of a drive-by
shooting yesterday,</i>

138
00:07:41,947 --> 00:07:46,087
<i>sat up on the autopsy table and actually
attacked Somerset medical examiners...</i>

139
00:07:46,088 --> 00:07:48,876
- Horseshit.
- Shut up, Tony, it's on the fuckin' news.

140
00:07:48,877 --> 00:07:53,494
The news is always horseshit. Always makes
things sound worse than they really are.

141
00:07:53,495 --> 00:07:55,415
That's how they
sell soap.

142
00:07:55,883 --> 00:07:58,305
And the next morning what happens?
"Oh sorry, our mistake. "

143
00:07:58,306 --> 00:08:00,710
and when they say that, who's gonna
believe this shit, two dead people...

144
00:08:00,711 --> 00:08:03,115
<i>There are now
five dead people and...</i>

145
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:05,520
<i>here's another.
They're coming in from everywhere.</i>

146
00:08:05,521 --> 00:08:08,599
<i>A corpse at Hope Memorial,
has apparently survived.</i>

147
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,839
<i>That’s six separate reports.</i>

148
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,147
Six?
How could there be six mistakes?

149
00:08:13,148 --> 00:08:15,746
For Christ’s sake, we hear
those sort of thing every day.

150
00:08:15,747 --> 00:08:19,112
Yeah, the hurricane,
the planet gettin' too hot,

151
00:08:19,113 --> 00:08:23,154
and the terrorist that was gonna dump a dirty
bomb on the Whitehouse or your house.

152
00:08:23,155 --> 00:08:26,906
Somebody gonna put some germs
in your water or your mailbox.

153
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:29,407
and that letter from
Publisher's Clearing House, huh?

154
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,428
The good news is you
won a million bucks,

155
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:34,025
bad news is you'll gonna
wake up dead tomorrow morning.

156
00:08:34,026 --> 00:08:35,853
Better believe what
we've just heard,

157
00:08:35,854 --> 00:08:39,606
the problem doesn't seem to be
that people are waking up dead.

158
00:08:39,607 --> 00:08:42,182
But that dead people
are waking up.

159
00:08:42,205 --> 00:08:43,580
Listen!

160
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,872
- What's that?
- What was that?

161
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,268
<i>A lot of people
are in on it.</i>

162
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:54,569
Right.

163
00:08:55,001 --> 00:09:00,003
If I'm gonna wake up dead,
it's gonna be in my own bedroom.

164
00:09:00,004 --> 00:09:01,504
You can all come.

165
00:09:01,735 --> 00:09:04,044
Eliot has the address,
he knows where is it.

166
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:08,373
Yeah, nice place too.
Cozy, takes up about half of Philadelphia.

167
00:09:08,374 --> 00:09:12,510
Yeah, it's a fuckin' fortress.
I can't get in unless I'm invited.

168
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,676
Sorry Jason, you're
worried about your movie.

169
00:09:14,677 --> 00:09:16,840
I don't mean to hang you
up or anything, but...

170
00:09:16,841 --> 00:09:19,041
I'm gettin' the fuck out of here.

171
00:09:23,094 --> 00:09:25,744
Like I said,
you can all come.

172
00:09:25,788 --> 00:09:28,301
I mean it.
It's an invitation.

173
00:09:30,502 --> 00:09:31,802
I'm in.

174
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:36,809
- Anyone else?
- Better be not.

175
00:09:42,336 --> 00:09:43,686
Bye guys.

176
00:09:47,147 --> 00:09:49,744
Fuckin' pommy gets all the girls.

177
00:09:49,745 --> 00:09:51,045
So...

178
00:09:51,861 --> 00:09:53,636
What are we going to do?

179
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:58,306
<i>- How do you explain, that...
- I have no explanation.</i>

180
00:09:58,307 --> 00:09:59,653
OK, what I'm
going to do.

181
00:09:59,654 --> 00:10:01,059
I'm going to the dorm,
Deb's there.

182
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,211
Whatever's happening,
I don't want her to be alone.

183
00:10:04,753 --> 00:10:07,160
<i>Transmit electrical
impulses</i>

184
00:10:07,161 --> 00:10:10,369
<i>strong enough,
to animate what little</i>

185
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:14,295
<i>remains of the body's
muscle tissues.</i>

186
00:10:17,935 --> 00:10:19,235
OK.

187
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:22,141
OK, this is the women's dorm.

188
00:10:27,749 --> 00:10:29,049
Jesus.

189
00:10:30,635 --> 00:10:33,809
It's been 25 minutes
since we've heard the news,

190
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,612
and it looks like
everybody's gone.

191
00:10:44,874 --> 00:10:46,499
Hello, who's
in there?

192
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,060
Fuck.

193
00:10:52,378 --> 00:10:53,820
What the fuck are
you doing here?

194
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:56,899
- What the fuck you're doing here?
- I'm stealing shit.

195
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,200
What about you...?

196
00:10:58,728 --> 00:11:03,153
What's a guy with a video
camera doing in the women's dorm?

197
00:11:03,154 --> 00:11:04,454
Security!

198
00:11:07,195 --> 00:11:08,495
Fuck.

199
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:10,419
Oh god.

200
00:11:11,524 --> 00:11:12,883
Oh shit.

201
00:11:20,183 --> 00:11:23,177
OK, OK, this is
Deb's room.

202
00:11:27,591 --> 00:11:30,907
- Wait! It's OK. It's me.
- Jesus, fuck..

203
00:11:32,017 --> 00:11:33,459
Are you still
shooting?

204
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,901
- What're you shooting?
- I'm just...

205
00:11:40,388 --> 00:11:41,688
Oh my god!

206
00:11:43,755 --> 00:11:47,314
- God, I'm so afraid.
- It's OK, Deb.

207
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:49,828
I'm here.

208
00:11:50,201 --> 00:11:54,526
I've been trying to call them,
for like an hour...

209
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,530
Shit!

210
00:12:09,444 --> 00:12:12,713
Shit! Same fuckin' thing,
no answer!

211
00:12:12,714 --> 00:12:14,253
Gotta get out there,
we'll see everything.

212
00:12:14,254 --> 00:12:15,552
- Babe!
- What?

213
00:12:15,553 --> 00:12:18,678
There's no answer at my house.
My mom, my dad, Billie...

214
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:21,469
- They're supposed to be there!
- Maybe they're up at the cabin.

215
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:25,945
No, I already tried there.
Everything's out.

216
00:12:29,263 --> 00:12:32,341
The circuits are busy, your folks probably
can't get through to you either.

217
00:12:32,342 --> 00:12:35,900
<i>It was all over the news,
all over the web.</i>

218
00:12:35,901 --> 00:12:38,210
<i>But no one knew what
was really happening.</i>

219
00:12:38,211 --> 00:12:40,411
I wanna get out of here.

220
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:41,819
J!

221
00:12:42,444 --> 00:12:44,294
I want to go home.

222
00:12:46,773 --> 00:12:49,274
<i>I think that's what
started the panic,</i>

223
00:12:49,275 --> 00:12:52,050
<i>not knowing the truth.</i>

224
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,816
<i>What's been happening?
I don't know,</i>

225
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,895
<i>the prospects
truly are terrifying.</i>

226
00:12:58,896 --> 00:13:03,146
<i>All my friends left before
we could even say goodbye.</i>

227
00:13:03,996 --> 00:13:07,458
<i>It's funny. You spend some much
time resenting your parents,</i>

228
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:09,960
<i>separating yourself,
building your own life,</i>

229
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:13,615
<i>but when the shit hits the fan,
the only place you want to go is</i>

230
00:13:13,616 --> 00:13:14,916
<i>home.</i>

231
00:13:18,812 --> 00:13:20,639
We're in Mary's
Winnebago,

232
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,690
trying to stick together.

233
00:13:21,691 --> 00:13:24,254
- What is this about, Jason?
- I don't know, I just...

234
00:13:24,255 --> 00:13:27,237
if this turns out to be a big thing,
I just want to record it, OK?

235
00:13:27,238 --> 00:13:29,642
Come on everybody, when it
comes to you, say your names.

236
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,143
This is ridiculous.

237
00:13:33,782 --> 00:13:37,629
- Mary. Mary Dexter.
- What are you doing here, Mary?

238
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,816
I'm going home...
trying to go home.

239
00:13:42,441 --> 00:13:44,911
Can you just not film me
while I'm driving, please?...

240
00:13:44,912 --> 00:13:45,904
so I can focus.

241
00:13:45,905 --> 00:13:46,904
Say your name.

242
00:13:46,905 --> 00:13:48,682
Jason, if you don't know
my name by now

243
00:13:48,683 --> 00:13:50,426
then you can get your clothes
out of my closet, OK?

244
00:13:50,427 --> 00:13:52,230
Come on, babe,
it's part of history.

245
00:13:55,431 --> 00:13:57,174
Debra Moynahan.

246
00:13:57,451 --> 00:14:00,626
And I'm trying to get home too, OK?
Like Mary.

247
00:14:00,627 --> 00:14:04,149
And I'm wondering why my boyfriend
has a camera plastered to his face.

248
00:14:06,016 --> 00:14:07,919
Scranton. OK?

249
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:10,276
Scranton. Pennsylvania.
That's my home.

250
00:14:10,826 --> 00:14:14,289
It's my parent's home.
And my little brother's.

251
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,740
- Where are you coming from?
- College.

252
00:14:18,235 --> 00:14:21,987
We're all at Pitt together.
University of Pittsburgh.

253
00:14:21,988 --> 00:14:24,777
- Why are we on the road?
- Christ.

254
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:27,664
Yeah, Christ, Jason.
Lay the fuck off!

255
00:14:27,665 --> 00:14:28,664
See this guy?

256
00:14:28,665 --> 00:14:31,874
He won't say who he is, so I will.
He's Tony Ravello. He's from...

257
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:35,073
- Where is he from? Brooklyn or the Bronx?
- Queens.

258
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,670
He does makeup
that comes unglued.

259
00:14:37,671 --> 00:14:40,234
You know what?
I'm a directing major, just like you.

260
00:14:40,943 --> 00:14:43,547
- I wasn't supposed to do makeup.
- No, I was.

261
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:45,523
Sorry, babe.

262
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,674
You know what happens
when we try to work together.

263
00:14:47,675 --> 00:14:49,164
I hear that.

264
00:14:53,681 --> 00:14:55,330
Why are we here
on the road?

265
00:14:56,118 --> 00:14:59,031
- Just trying to get out of Dodge right now.
- Why?

266
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:01,635
What do you want
me to say, Jason?

267
00:15:01,783 --> 00:15:04,526
No, it's not what I want you want to say,
it’s what you want to say. Tell us...

268
00:15:04,527 --> 00:15:06,921
Why does everyone wanna
get the hell out of Dodge?

269
00:15:06,922 --> 00:15:10,786
Cause of this thing, this crazy
thing that's happenin'.

270
00:15:10,787 --> 00:15:11,771
It is crazy.

271
00:15:11,772 --> 00:15:15,293
- Where are you going, Tony?
- Nowhere. No place to go.

272
00:15:15,294 --> 00:15:19,369
Except to hang with you, Jason,
until I can't take any more of your shit.

273
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,369
Hey, guys!

274
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,010
<i>Can you explain why the department
of Homeland Security suddenly</i>

275
00:15:23,011 --> 00:15:25,693
<i>raised its alert level to orange
earlier this evening</i>

276
00:15:25,694 --> 00:15:28,921
<i>even though there are no
indications of a terrorist attack?</i>

277
00:15:28,922 --> 00:15:32,080
<i>Your right, there's no
indication of any terrorism.</i>

278
00:15:32,081 --> 00:15:34,450
<i>We believe these are
simply isolated and</i>

279
00:15:34,451 --> 00:15:37,135
<i>unrelated phenomenon, and we expect
things to return to normal very soon.</i>

280
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:40,948
See? They've already started
playing this shit down.

281
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:43,709
<i>...maybe due to a
previous unknown viral strain</i>

282
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,701
<i>that leads, to a kind
of mass psychosis.</i>

283
00:15:46,702 --> 00:15:49,705
- Psychosis, who's going to believe that?
- Psychotic?

284
00:15:49,706 --> 00:15:52,561
<i>The President continues to monitor
the situation from his ranch and</i>

285
00:15:52,562 --> 00:15:55,582
<i>he's asked the American
people to remain vigilant.</i>

286
00:15:56,045 --> 00:15:59,047
- Say who you are, Eliot.
- You just did, I'm Eliot.

287
00:15:59,048 --> 00:16:00,309
Tell us more.

288
00:16:00,618 --> 00:16:02,952
Eliot Stone, Harrisburgh PA.

289
00:16:02,953 --> 00:16:05,784
I'm here with you fine people
because, I don't know

290
00:16:05,785 --> 00:16:07,187
I'd like to get home, too.

291
00:16:07,296 --> 00:16:09,900
It's on the way, I'm hoping you'll
be so kind as to drop me off.

292
00:16:10,153 --> 00:16:11,715
Seems like everybody
wants to get home.

293
00:16:11,716 --> 00:16:14,468
I know what you're trying
to do, Jason. I get it.

294
00:16:14,469 --> 00:16:17,355
Gordo Thorsen.
Denver, Pennsylvania.

295
00:16:17,356 --> 00:16:21,505
Tracy Thurman.
We're a...

296
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,680
together.
- Forever.

297
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,866
We'll see.

298
00:16:26,696 --> 00:16:27,908
What's that?

299
00:16:28,061 --> 00:16:31,262
Oh... this is
my camera.

300
00:16:31,404 --> 00:16:33,054
Smile.

301
00:16:33,264 --> 00:16:34,748
Thurman and Gordo.

302
00:16:35,408 --> 00:16:36,854
Gimme a kiss.

303
00:16:37,634 --> 00:16:40,544
Oh, I'm from San Antone,
that's Texas.

304
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,856
Don't mess with Texas.

305
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,835
Holy shit.
Look at this guy!

306
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:46,526
Christ!

307
00:16:49,686 --> 00:16:52,561
He's gotta be doing like
a buck twenty.

308
00:16:53,572 --> 00:16:55,014
Professor?

309
00:16:55,609 --> 00:16:58,153
Ah-ha, you finally come to me,
I was beginning to feel rejected.

310
00:16:59,456 --> 00:17:01,430
- It's just that...
- So far away, I know.

311
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:03,032
In storage...

312
00:17:03,572 --> 00:17:06,432
sitting on a toilet seat
with everyone's dirty laundry.

313
00:17:08,353 --> 00:17:10,914
Andrew Maxwell,
analyst.

314
00:17:10,915 --> 00:17:13,387
Nowhere to go,
nothing to do.

315
00:17:15,124 --> 00:17:16,864
and I'm not
with anybody.

316
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:19,621
Like Mr. Ravello, I'm just
popping along for the ride.

317
00:17:20,013 --> 00:17:21,438
I'm not with
anyone either.

318
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:23,885
I'm... just...

319
00:17:24,133 --> 00:17:26,057
here all alone...
just me and Saint Chris.

320
00:17:26,058 --> 00:17:29,913
We'll probably be calling on ol' Saint Chris
before this night's over.

321
00:17:30,203 --> 00:17:31,891
Oh my god!
Look!

322
00:17:32,335 --> 00:17:35,703
We'll never get past that. Turn around.
We should go back to the dorms.

323
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,659
- Look!
- It's a cop.

324
00:17:38,031 --> 00:17:39,871
- He's a State Trooper
- How do you know that?

325
00:17:40,002 --> 00:17:42,850
- His hat is... because his hat.
- He looks hurt.

326
00:17:42,851 --> 00:17:47,440
- He's all burned up.
- Not just burned, he's fuckin' fried!

327
00:17:48,285 --> 00:17:49,438
Oh my...

328
00:17:49,439 --> 00:17:50,552
He's dead!

329
00:17:50,553 --> 00:17:52,957
I'm telling you, he can't be
anything else but dead.

330
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,991
Oh my god!

331
00:17:55,076 --> 00:17:58,520
I think he wants more than
your license and registration!

332
00:18:01,618 --> 00:18:02,976
Go! Go!

333
00:18:04,505 --> 00:18:05,805
Oh fuck!

334
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,757
Fuck!

335
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:12,393
Wait, wait, wait!

336
00:18:12,394 --> 00:18:14,233
What's that?
What's that?

337
00:18:38,563 --> 00:18:39,562
What'll we do?

338
00:18:39,563 --> 00:18:42,413
- What time is it?
- Almost three.

339
00:18:42,508 --> 00:18:45,008
I think we should pull over.

340
00:18:54,053 --> 00:18:55,828
How do you feel?

341
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:58,382
Mary?

342
00:18:58,383 --> 00:19:01,077
How do you feel about
what just happened?

343
00:19:01,078 --> 00:19:04,540
- I killed six of them...
- They were already dead, OK?

344
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,561
You didn't anything
wrong.

345
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,619
Listen to me.

346
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,793
Jesus fuckin' Christ... you don't stand up
and walk around when you're dead!

347
00:19:10,794 --> 00:19:12,369
Will you shut up?

348
00:19:12,623 --> 00:19:14,931
We just killed three
people back there.

349
00:19:14,932 --> 00:19:16,794
Three living, breathing
people like us.

350
00:19:16,795 --> 00:19:18,995
No we didn't.

351
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:22,952
I did.

352
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,434
Shit.

353
00:19:47,524 --> 00:19:51,518
We've stopped somewhere...
off the road.

354
00:19:51,854 --> 00:19:54,311
God knows where.

355
00:19:54,645 --> 00:19:56,761
You gonna say
something?

356
00:19:56,762 --> 00:20:01,587
No, I don't know. Just give
her some time, you know.

357
00:20:02,632 --> 00:20:04,282
I'm running low.

358
00:20:04,654 --> 00:20:09,080
If I can make it to the State store
before they all shut their doors forever...

359
00:20:09,081 --> 00:20:11,100
god, that's a
terrible thought.

360
00:20:11,101 --> 00:20:16,211
The world where a gentleman
can't buy a bottle of bourbon.

361
00:20:18,054 --> 00:20:19,184
Mary?

362
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:21,012
- Oh god, Mary!
- Mary

363
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:24,513
What did she do?
- What the fuck did she do?

364
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,894
- Any anyone know she had a gun?
- Why would she do this?

365
00:20:27,469 --> 00:20:30,470
Because of what happened?
Those people back there?

366
00:20:31,482 --> 00:20:32,776
It's our fault.

367
00:20:33,402 --> 00:20:35,456
We're panicking,
we're turning this into...

368
00:20:35,872 --> 00:20:37,175
Into what?

369
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,088
Some that's not.

370
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,702
Some more than this is.
This is all just bullshit!

371
00:20:41,703 --> 00:20:43,172
You keep calling this bullshit,

372
00:20:43,173 --> 00:20:44,879
someone else is
gonna kill them self!

373
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,899
You heard the TV,
Mary heard the TV.

374
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,376
We all should have
stayed at school

375
00:20:48,377 --> 00:20:49,894
instead of driving around
in the middle of nowhere.

376
00:20:49,895 --> 00:20:52,043
knocking down fuckin'
people like bowling pins.

377
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:54,094
- She's still alive.
- What?!

378
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,121
She's got a pulse!

379
00:21:00,045 --> 00:21:01,543
- Mary!
- Pressure! Pressure!

380
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:05,680
- Looks like everyone's left.
- Yeah, up in a hurry.

381
00:21:05,954 --> 00:21:07,464
This is a hospital,
where else is she supposed to go?

382
00:21:07,465 --> 00:21:09,742
Just because we can't see anybody,
doesn't mean no one’s here.

383
00:21:09,743 --> 00:21:12,689
- Maybe they're hiding?
- Yeah, maybe they're hiding because they think we're dead.

384
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:15,642
- Hello, we aren't dead!
- Cut it out, Tony.

385
00:21:17,129 --> 00:21:18,655
Wait, wait, wait,
where are we going?

386
00:21:18,656 --> 00:21:21,940
You guys look for a doctor,
we're gonna find the ER.

387
00:21:21,941 --> 00:21:24,382
Hello!
Is anyone here?

388
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:28,576
Wait, wait.
I think I heard somebody.

389
00:21:28,858 --> 00:21:30,783
It's down here,
come on.

390
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,186
It's just the radio.

391
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:02,225
Hello?
Is anyone...

392
00:22:02,763 --> 00:22:03,894
What?

393
00:22:04,754 --> 00:22:07,832
<i>We're prisoners here.
So far as we can't move.</i>

394
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,287
<i>Stand by!
Stand by!</i>

395
00:22:16,012 --> 00:22:18,412
It's complete chaos.

396
00:22:19,574 --> 00:22:21,990
It's complete chaos.

397
00:22:22,075 --> 00:22:23,800
<i>We got them!
We got them!</i>

398
00:22:25,296 --> 00:22:26,994
<i>I can't do it.</i>

399
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:30,048
<i>- Get that son of a bitch!
- We got five of them here!</i>

400
00:22:30,936 --> 00:22:31,850
<i>Where are you, sir?</i>

401
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,585
<i>- Got to get them in the head.
- Got to get them in the head.</i>

402
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:38,626
<i>- Get everyone out of here!
- You've got to get them in the head!</i>

403
00:22:38,627 --> 00:22:42,127
I hope this isn't some
sort of mistake?

404
00:22:42,684 --> 00:22:45,934
This is a hospital,
there's nobody here.

405
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:53,427
Is this for real?

406
00:22:55,097 --> 00:22:56,797
What about Mary?

407
00:22:57,985 --> 00:23:00,786
What if...
she dies?

408
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,740
We're not gonna be able to by just
standing around here.

409
00:23:03,741 --> 00:23:07,197
- Fuck! Losing juice.
- Let’s see if we can find some batteries.

410
00:23:10,951 --> 00:23:12,997
- There's somebody!
- Excuse me!

411
00:23:13,383 --> 00:23:14,707
Excuse me.

412
00:23:15,138 --> 00:23:18,868
We've an emergency.
Our friend is hurt and we need help.

413
00:23:19,724 --> 00:23:21,972
Oh my god, what's
wrong with him?

414
00:23:21,973 --> 00:23:23,448
He's dead. That's what
wrong with him..

415
00:23:23,449 --> 00:23:25,634
- Get the gun.
- Debby, gun!

416
00:23:29,003 --> 00:23:32,319
- Try the head! Try the head!
- Yeah, shoot him in the head!

417
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,480
Shoot him in the head!

418
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,917
- Fuck, the battery's almost dead.
- Yeah, that's not all?

419
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:39,672
What do you mean?

420
00:23:39,673 --> 00:23:41,754
- What is going on?
- Jesus, the nurse.

421
00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:45,044
Dead doctor, dead nurse,
makes sense, doesn't it?

422
00:23:45,763 --> 00:23:47,790
Fuckin' hurry up!
Gordo!

423
00:23:47,938 --> 00:23:49,014
It's jammed!

424
00:23:49,015 --> 00:23:50,887
- OK, I'm gonna try something.
- What?!

425
00:23:50,937 --> 00:23:52,265
Get her attention,
just to try to get her attention!

426
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:54,796
Come over here!
Hey, come after me!

427
00:23:54,797 --> 00:23:56,683
Careful, Debra.
Careful.

428
00:23:57,999 --> 00:23:59,357
Jesus H!

429
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:01,544
Jesus Christ.

430
00:24:03,426 --> 00:24:07,450
Whoa, whoa, those are hot!
Put it back where you've found them.

431
00:24:10,753 --> 00:24:12,297
We've got to get
her a doctor.

432
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:14,517
Yeah, a live one.

433
00:24:16,395 --> 00:24:18,064
I got it.

434
00:24:23,889 --> 00:24:25,558
Let's go.

435
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,416
Don't leave
without me.

436
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:30,622
What?
You're not coming with us?

437
00:24:30,623 --> 00:24:33,539
- I can't, I gotta plug in.
- Leave it, let it charge.

438
00:24:33,564 --> 00:24:36,051
I can't, I can't leave
without the camera.

439
00:24:36,086 --> 00:24:37,371
The camera's the
whole thing.

440
00:24:37,372 --> 00:24:39,380
Getting help is
the whole thing.

441
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:49,379
I should be
with them.

442
00:24:50,151 --> 00:24:51,473
Maybe I can help.

443
00:24:53,371 --> 00:24:55,348
I can't.
I can't.

444
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,265
Because...

445
00:24:57,624 --> 00:24:59,021
I'm fuckin'
locked in.

446
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:04,946
Some shit, huh?

447
00:25:05,832 --> 00:25:07,981
What's wrong with these
fuckin' dead guys.

448
00:25:10,711 --> 00:25:12,112
I'm sorry, Mary.

449
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:16,762
If anything that Tony said,
or I said, or Ted, made you...

450
00:25:19,264 --> 00:25:23,658
People you killed were dead.
These people are dead.

451
00:25:24,277 --> 00:25:25,584
At least they
look dead.

452
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,472
The way,
things are...

453
00:25:31,852 --> 00:25:33,280
who the fuck knows.

454
00:25:36,456 --> 00:25:37,607
Mary?

455
00:25:39,445 --> 00:25:40,578
Mary?

456
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:47,448
Shit.

457
00:25:48,674 --> 00:25:50,357
Guys?

458
00:25:52,767 --> 00:25:54,246
Guys, what's happening?

459
00:25:55,399 --> 00:25:56,998
Fuck!
God damn it!

460
00:25:58,428 --> 00:26:00,087
Hello?

461
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:03,036
Hello!

462
00:26:05,709 --> 00:26:07,503
I found this in
one of the other rooms.

463
00:26:11,981 --> 00:26:13,508
Tell us your name.

464
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:15,925
Say it!

465
00:26:15,926 --> 00:26:17,382
- Deb, come on.
- Say it!

466
00:26:17,383 --> 00:26:19,936
Gimme a break.
Jason Creed.

467
00:26:19,989 --> 00:26:23,164
See how it feels to have a camera
shoved in your face?

468
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:26,578
to have to answer stupid questions
when people are dying all around you.

469
00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:27,880
You see how it feels?

470
00:26:27,881 --> 00:26:32,018
Deb, just put the thing down
and tell me what happened.

471
00:26:32,019 --> 00:26:33,669
Well, you missed it.

472
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:39,441
If it didn't happen on camera,
it’s like it didn't happen, right?

473
00:26:40,393 --> 00:26:43,773
There was a patient
in one of the other rooms.

474
00:26:45,206 --> 00:26:48,970
He looked nice, you know,
not dead.

475
00:26:49,632 --> 00:26:51,857
But...
he was...

476
00:26:53,675 --> 00:26:57,275
he was on top of me
before I saw him.

477
00:26:58,102 --> 00:26:59,727
It was Gordo who shot him.

478
00:27:02,433 --> 00:27:05,318
Jesus! Did you...
I mean..

479
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:06,619
Hurt me?

480
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:08,880
No.

481
00:27:08,881 --> 00:27:10,806
So who was screaming?

482
00:27:11,382 --> 00:27:12,682
Me.

483
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,365
You want me to
show you how?

484
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:15,716
For the camera?

485
00:27:16,003 --> 00:27:17,653
For history?

486
00:27:20,045 --> 00:27:22,620
That's enough, Deb.
I got it...

487
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:24,425
Oh god!

488
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,730
I just shot
another man.

489
00:27:38,042 --> 00:27:41,967
I've killed three men and a woman
in the last half hour.

490
00:27:42,855 --> 00:27:45,280
You can't be certain they're dead.

491
00:27:45,935 --> 00:27:48,010
I remember the war.

492
00:27:48,245 --> 00:27:51,920
In war time,
killing comes easy.

493
00:27:52,768 --> 00:27:55,768
Especially when you don't
have to do any of it.

494
00:27:56,521 --> 00:27:59,311
There will be always
be people like you.

495
00:27:59,312 --> 00:28:02,873
Wanting to document, wanting
to record, some sort of diary.

496
00:28:02,874 --> 00:28:05,607
Me? You're the one who
put the camera in my hands.

497
00:28:05,749 --> 00:28:07,204
You're the one who made
me want to do this.

498
00:28:07,205 --> 00:28:09,321
Not this.
This is a diary recording.

499
00:28:09,322 --> 00:28:12,047
In war times only the enemy can be marked,
like this son of a bitch...

500
00:28:12,048 --> 00:28:13,420
...or that son of a bitch.

501
00:28:13,749 --> 00:28:15,824
Then cruelty...

502
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:17,898
becomes justified.

503
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:22,230
God! Oh my god,
look at Mary!

504
00:28:22,892 --> 00:28:26,176
- She's... She's dead.
- She's turning.

505
00:28:26,453 --> 00:28:27,753
Oh god.

506
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:31,168
This is much
too much!

507
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:32,469
Too much.

508
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,860
God, I don't know...

509
00:28:36,944 --> 00:28:38,569
Give it to me.

510
00:28:38,579 --> 00:28:42,429
You can't do this,
give me the gun.

511
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:55,049
Oh man!
Oh my god! Oh my god!

512
00:28:55,614 --> 00:28:57,889
Your stuttering, Mr. Creed.

513
00:28:58,887 --> 00:29:01,196
Don't try to speak,
just shoot.

514
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:04,661
Shoot your picture, shoot for as
long as your hard drive runs out.

515
00:29:04,662 --> 00:29:06,987
As long as
you're found.

516
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,330
Take this.

517
00:29:11,591 --> 00:29:13,441
It's too easy to use.

518
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:19,925
Let's get
out of here.

519
00:29:22,948 --> 00:29:28,048
<i>It's interesting how quickly we'll
find out what we're capable of becoming.</i>

520
00:29:29,397 --> 00:29:33,053
<i>Up until that night,
we had lived predictable lives.</i>

521
00:29:33,054 --> 00:29:37,865
<i>Now, we will never be able
to predict what might happen next.</i>

522
00:29:37,866 --> 00:29:40,464
<i>God has changed
the rules on us.</i>

523
00:29:40,465 --> 00:29:42,240
<i>And surprisingly,</i>

524
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,765
<i>we were
playing along.</i>

525
00:29:48,645 --> 00:29:49,799
What the?

526
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,100
Jesus, Gordo!
Look out!

527
00:29:53,649 --> 00:29:55,549
What?
What happened?

528
00:30:03,275 --> 00:30:07,124
You got that,
huh, Tony?

529
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:10,107
After I stab them through the
heart, with this freakin' IV pole.

530
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:12,802
Why don't you
fuckin' die, huh?

531
00:30:12,803 --> 00:30:14,878
Fuckin' die.

532
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:22,510
You got that, Tony, Huh?
You'll probably at least fuckin' understand?

533
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:34,055
- What happened?
- It hurts. The bite.

534
00:30:36,383 --> 00:30:37,683
It hurts.

535
00:30:41,964 --> 00:30:44,176
Take this.
It's too easy to use.

536
00:30:44,177 --> 00:30:45,910
Come on Debby, you can
shot better than me.

537
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:51,261
Yeah that's what I thought,
I don't want to become you.

538
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:56,977
<i>There are currently more than 200 million
video cameras in people's hands worldwide.</i>

539

<i>blogs, video windows,

541
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:08,826
<i>Does the media put ourselves
ahead of what we see happening?</i>

<i>particular views.</i>

544
00:31:16,075 --> 00:31:20,557
<i>Compelled, like the man said.
Jason was compelled.</i>

545
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:23,059
<i>I've never seen
him like that before.</i>

546
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:27,583
<i>What is it? What gets into our heads,
when we see something horrible?</i>

547
00:31:27,584 --> 00:31:30,374
<i>A horrible accident
on the highway.</i>

548
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:33,260
<i>Some things just keep us
from just driving on.</i>

549
00:31:33,261 --> 00:31:35,186
<i>Some things holds us.</i>

550
00:31:35,187 --> 00:31:39,762
<i>We don't stop to help,
we stop to look.</i>

551
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:50,685
First morning since
we've hit the road.

552
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:54,723
We're here to say goodbye.

553
00:31:54,724 --> 00:31:58,049
I don't understand
why he died.

554
00:31:58,755 --> 00:32:03,192
It was just a bite. How can someone
die from one little bite?

555
00:32:03,193 --> 00:32:05,598
Maybe it's some kind of
poison or something.

556
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:06,946
Maybe it is a virus.

557
00:32:06,947 --> 00:32:09,449
Anyone that gets sick
comes back as one of them.

558
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:12,046
No, anyone who dies
comes back as one of them.

559
00:32:12,047 --> 00:32:13,897
Thurman and Gordo.

560
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:18,603
No! No!

561
00:32:19,267 --> 00:32:21,106
Gotta bury him, right?

562
00:32:21,287 --> 00:32:24,722
How would you feel,
waking up in six feet of dirt?

563
00:32:24,723 --> 00:32:28,475
Can't we just wait?
Can't we, at least just wait and see?

564
00:32:28,476 --> 00:32:30,786
Maybe it won't
happen to him.

565
00:32:30,787 --> 00:32:33,587
Please, can we
just wait?

566
00:32:46,379 --> 00:32:50,036
- Hey guys, we gotta get going. I gotta...
- Get home?

567
00:32:50,037 --> 00:32:51,337
Yeah.

568
00:32:51,578 --> 00:32:53,308
Although after this,
I'm not sure what we're gonna find.

569
00:32:53,309 --> 00:32:55,807
Your folks will be fine, Deb.
They're smart people, like you.

570
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,999
Oh shit.
Look!

571
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,750
Poor Gordo.

572
00:33:12,368 --> 00:33:14,218

If that's what it is,
I can fix it.

- Oh yeah
- Yeah.

594
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,588

out here guys.

We have to wait

599
00:34:46,358 --> 00:34:48,320
I'm going to see
where the others went.

Oh shit!

602

Whoa, whoa, stop, stop!
I don't think he's dead.

603
00:34:55,845 --> 00:34:56,868
He might not
be dead!.

604
00:34:56,869 --> 00:35:01,772

609

00:35:47,295 --> 00:35:48,891
I thought the Amish
were friendly folks!

616
00:35:48,892 --> 00:35:51,449
"I'M SAMUEL
HELLO"

617
00:35:52,628 --> 00:35:56,381
Yep, cap line's
leaking.

618
00:35:56,382 --> 00:36:02,161
I'm gonna cut the line below the tear
and get it hooked back up to the post.

619
00:36:02,162 --> 00:36:04,152
Thanks.

620
00:36:08,881 --> 00:36:11,688
What is that?
Guys, what's all the screaming?

621
00:36:11,689 --> 00:36:13,141
Birthday party.

622
00:36:13,142 --> 00:36:14,927
Where did you
find this?

623
00:36:14,928 --> 00:36:18,653
It was in the camera
Deb found in the hospital.

624
00:36:29,514 --> 00:36:31,821
That's the guy, the one
in the orange shirt.

625
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:35,847
That's the guy from the hospital,
the one I thought looked nice.

626
00:36:36,976 --> 00:36:39,224
The one Gordo shot.

627
00:36:42,894 --> 00:36:44,233
What's that?

628
00:36:44,234 --> 00:36:46,354
Guys, What that?

629
00:36:47,128 --> 00:36:49,133
They're in the back.
At the back wall.

630
00:36:49,134 --> 00:36:51,815
They're out front as well.

631
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:56,367
What the hell is going on out there?

632
00:36:56,368 --> 00:36:59,091
Jesus Christ.

633
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,764
Oh god, there's
plenty of them.

634
00:37:14,171 --> 00:37:16,403
"BACK DOOR"

635
00:37:16,404 --> 00:37:18,347
Simply sorry for,
for all the trouble.

636
00:37:18,348 --> 00:37:20,555
Hurry in, I wanna
get out of here.

637
00:37:20,556 --> 00:37:25,908
Not to apply unnecessary pressure,
but we are all relying on you, darling.

638
00:37:25,909 --> 00:37:28,509
Oh god,
the doors open.

639
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:37,741
I hear something.

640
00:37:49,404 --> 00:37:51,238
Maybe one of them got in already.

641
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:53,097
Maybe more than one.

642
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:04,229
<i>- Guys, what's happening?
- We're alright!</i>

643
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:07,087
We're alright.

644
00:38:15,498 --> 00:38:16,497
Almost there.

645
00:38:16,498 --> 00:38:19,714
Certainly hope so, darling,
as much as I'd love staying, I wanna go home.

646
00:38:32,469 --> 00:38:33,775
Tracy,
I love you!

647
00:38:33,776 --> 00:38:38,826
- Alright, open the door!
- Open up, Tony, let's go!

648
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:43,712
See how many, there are?
Look how many.

649
00:38:43,713 --> 00:38:44,877
Come on,
come on.

650
00:38:44,878 --> 00:38:46,603
Excuse me gentlemen,
hurry!

651
00:38:55,702 --> 00:38:58,396
Oh my god!

652
00:38:58,397 --> 00:39:00,299
We're alright,
we're alright!

653
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,476
- Nothing we can do,
let's go.

654
00:39:01,477 --> 00:39:03,908
They're all going to be all over us.
Let's go

655
00:39:17,828 --> 00:39:21,289
<i>It's estimated that if something
doesn't stop the slaughter</i>

656
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:23,693
<i>in three or four days,
our death rates will quadruple.</i>

657
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,484
<i>within 10 days, it will
have risen by 100 percent.</i>

658
00:39:26,485 --> 00:39:30,428
<i>Before, there were, I don't know,
how many people died every minute...</i>

659
00:39:30,429 --> 00:39:32,845
<i>8? 10? 20?</i>

660
00:39:33,892 --> 00:39:38,567
<i>Now there are 5 times as many,
10 times, a 100 times.</i>

661
00:39:39,641 --> 00:39:42,248
<i>Dead, but...
walking.</i>

662
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:45,699
<i>There weren't enough bullets
to stop them all.</i>

663
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,962
<i>They're monsters.
Monsters who prey on the flesh of the living.</i>

664
00:39:48,963 --> 00:39:51,988
<i>We needed supplies...
Gas.</i>

665
00:39:52,241 --> 00:39:54,763
<i>Without gas, we weren't
going anywhere.</i>

666
00:39:54,764 --> 00:39:56,109
There might be more
of them around.

667
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:58,226
- Think we can make it?
- We gotta try.

668
00:39:58,227 --> 00:39:59,860
Get in, fill up, get out fast.

669
00:39:59,861 --> 00:40:01,961
Yes, but what if...

670
00:40:02,428 --> 00:40:03,486
Put the gun down!

671
00:40:03,487 --> 00:40:05,697
- Who the hell are you?
- Don't matter who I am.

672
00:40:05,698 --> 00:40:07,334
All that matters
is what I got.

673
00:40:07,335 --> 00:40:10,123
What he's got is better than
ours, Tony, way better.

674
00:40:10,124 --> 00:40:11,424
Damn right.

675
00:40:11,471 --> 00:40:14,645
This is an M16 semi-automatic,
with the safety turned off.

676
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:16,728
and I'm just trying to decide,

677
00:40:16,729 --> 00:40:20,129
do I pump two bullets at
your brain, or just one.

678
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,430
Alright.
Cool.

679
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:25,981
Good choice.

680
00:40:26,671 --> 00:40:29,363
Now who the hell are you all?
Some kind of news people?

681
00:40:29,364 --> 00:40:33,014
No, students.
University of Pittsburgh.

682
00:40:33,021 --> 00:40:36,002
Damn, now the whole town
is going crazy.

683
00:40:36,003 --> 00:40:37,002
Come on!

684
00:40:37,003 --> 00:40:40,590
- Come on, where?
- Any place is better than this.

685
00:40:40,591 --> 00:40:43,966
Come on! Before we
get our asses shot off!

686
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:48,092
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

687
00:40:48,093 --> 00:40:51,650
<i>Write their names, kick them out,
lock the door, and throw away the keys?</i>

688
00:40:51,651 --> 00:40:55,208
<i>We've become hysterical about people
crossing the border into our country.</i>

689
00:40:55,209 --> 00:40:56,460
<i>That's not the problem anymore.</i>

690
00:40:56,461 --> 00:41:02,761
<i>The problem now is, all those strangers
crossing the borders, who can...</i>

691
00:41:09,637 --> 00:41:11,367
What the hell's with
that camera anyway?

692
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:12,918
Home movies.

693
00:41:13,026 --> 00:41:14,669
Who's gonna be
left to watch?

694
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:25,794
So, what's up with you all?

695
00:41:25,795 --> 00:41:27,525
What the hell you're
doing in my town?

696
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:30,122
We're trying to get to Stranton.
We need fuel.

697
00:41:30,123 --> 00:41:32,130
We were at the pump,
back there at the gas station.

698
00:41:32,131 --> 00:41:34,850
Them pumps are dry.
I've saved up all the gas.

699
00:41:34,851 --> 00:41:36,658
Can we buy some
of what you took?

700
00:41:36,756 --> 00:41:39,661
Buy? If this is keeps up,
money ain't gonna be worth nothing.

701
00:41:40,317 --> 00:41:43,202
I'm talking about gas.
Yeah, I'll let you have some.

702
00:41:43,203 --> 00:41:46,953
- Enough to get where you're going.
- What's with you all?

703
00:41:46,954 --> 00:41:49,935
- How come you've stuck around?
- Cause we got the power.

704
00:41:49,936 --> 00:41:53,236
For the first time in our lives.
We got the power.

705
00:41:54,072 --> 00:41:56,090
Cause everybody else left.

706
00:41:56,091 --> 00:41:58,496
All of us folks have suntans.

707
00:41:58,497 --> 00:42:01,263
They'll be back, right?
The National Guards.

708
00:42:01,692 --> 00:42:03,750
Somebody's gotta put all
this shit back together.

709
00:42:03,751 --> 00:42:08,594
What National Guard?
Kid, I'm in the National Guard.

710
00:42:08,595 --> 00:42:10,209
I know what's coming up,
with nothing together.

711
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:11,777
That's why I
got all this shit.

712
00:42:12,057 --> 00:42:14,268
Anything worth anything
all under one roof.

713
00:42:14,269 --> 00:42:15,268
It's called looting.

714
00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:18,544
No, ma'am, it's called doing
what you've got to do.

715
00:42:19,175 --> 00:42:20,575
Can I get online?

716
00:42:21,098 --> 00:42:22,398
Back there.

717
00:42:24,945 --> 00:42:26,245
Excuse me.

718
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,792
It's alright,
let them through.

719
00:42:28,793 --> 00:42:30,093
Let 'em through!

720
00:42:34,161 --> 00:42:35,753
<i>A reporter was
on the scene,</i>

721
00:42:35,754 --> 00:42:38,992
<i>Here's Homestead's
Chief of Police, Arthur Tacks.</i>

722
00:42:38,993 --> 00:42:42,162
<i>This attack was carried out by
a bunch of illegal immigrants.</i>

723
00:42:45,131 --> 00:42:48,220
<i>The only time they were dead
was when the white guy shot him.</i>

724
00:42:48,221 --> 00:42:50,771
They changed it.
They've re-cut it.

725
00:42:51,684 --> 00:42:53,606
<i>The media
was lying to us.</i>

726
00:42:53,607 --> 00:42:55,722
<i>Or the government
was lying to them.</i>

727
00:42:55,723 --> 00:42:58,848
<i>They were trying to make it seem
like everything was going to be alright.</i>

728
00:42:58,849 --> 00:43:00,992
- What are you doing?
- I just want to shoot us...

729
00:43:00,993 --> 00:43:03,547
- while we're editing..
- I want to cover everything.

730
00:43:03,548 --> 00:43:08,358
<i>Now I can understand, why Jason
was so anxious to upload his own footage.</i>

731
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:10,775
<i>At the time,
I didn't get it.</i>

732
00:43:11,437 --> 00:43:14,762
now look at the angle
from your camera.

733
00:43:24,136 --> 00:43:25,289
<i>Put the gun down!</i>

734
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:27,598
<i>- Who the hell are you?
- Don't matter who I am.</i>

735
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,330
<i>All that matters
is what I got.</i>

736
00:43:29,331 --> 00:43:32,120
- And after that, we drove here.
- Yeah.

737
00:43:32,121 --> 00:43:35,390
Sure, it'll be nice to have the surveillance
camera and go from where we drove in.

738
00:43:35,391 --> 00:43:38,291
Figured that much,
here!

739
00:43:38,374 --> 00:43:42,040
The recording of the security cameras.
Put the 7/11 in here.

740
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:45,107
- I got it all queued up for you.
- You're fuckin' brilliant man.

741
00:43:45,108 --> 00:43:46,014
Why thank you.

742
00:43:46,015 --> 00:43:47,187
What'd you do. Did you
get up there to record it?

743
00:43:47,188 --> 00:43:48,763
It's a wireless system,
pretty sophisticated.

744
00:43:48,764 --> 00:43:52,911
So sophisticated that I was easily able
to rip it off right out of the air.

745
00:43:53,612 --> 00:43:54,855
Beautiful.
This is Excellent.

746
00:43:54,856 --> 00:43:56,069
So what are
you guys doing?

747
00:43:59,578 --> 00:44:01,558
- Editing.
- Editing what?

748
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:03,642
The stuff we shot.

749
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:06,347
When you said you
wanted to get online

750
00:44:06,348 --> 00:44:08,922
I thought, you wanna get in contact
with your dad or something.

751
00:44:08,923 --> 00:44:10,890
No, I just wanted
to upload our shoot.

752
00:44:10,891 --> 00:44:12,191
Look!

753
00:44:12,526 --> 00:44:15,026
72 thousand hits.

754
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:17,012
In 8 minutes.

755
00:44:19,283 --> 00:44:21,233
Hey Eliot, can we
have a moment please?

756
00:44:21,234 --> 00:44:22,485
Yeah.

757
00:44:25,994 --> 00:44:27,819
Is the camera on?

758
00:44:27,918 --> 00:44:28,917
Yeah.

759
00:44:28,918 --> 00:44:32,055
If we're gonna have a conversation,
I'm sure you'd like to have it on tape.

760
00:44:32,056 --> 00:44:36,672
If it’s not on camera,
it’s like it never happened, right?

761
00:44:36,673 --> 00:44:38,307
OK J,
listen to me.

762
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:40,521
I'm trying to get home
to my family, OK?

763
00:44:40,522 --> 00:44:42,252
I'm out there
trying to get home.

764
00:44:42,253 --> 00:44:44,753
and you're in here,
dicking around on your computer..

765

767
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,528
They're coming in,
from all over the world.

768
00:44:51,529 --> 00:44:52,931
They're not getting the
truth from anybody else.

769
00:44:52,932 --> 00:44:55,335
All that shit on the news,
is a pack of lies.

770
00:44:55,336 --> 00:44:58,221
72 thousand hits in 8 minutes,
that's unbelievable!

771
00:44:58,222 --> 00:45:01,012
- Congratulations, you're famous
- That's not what it's about.

772
00:45:01,013 --> 00:45:03,705
Would you rather have people not
knowing whats going on in the world?

773
00:45:03,706 --> 00:45:06,784
We might even be able to save
somebody's fuckin' life here.

774
00:45:06,785 --> 00:45:08,419
72 thousand hits.

775
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:12,171
In another hour, it will be probably be
a million, by tomorrow, who knows..

776
00:45:12,172 --> 00:45:15,495
All over the world,
people learning how to survive,

777
00:45:15,496 --> 00:45:17,895
by seeing how we've
managed to survive.

778
00:45:19,676 --> 00:45:22,726
You always know how to
make a good argument, J.

779
00:45:27,949 --> 00:45:30,546
Oh my god! Text message
from my little brother.

780
00:45:30,547 --> 00:45:32,385
Well, what's it say?

781
00:45:33,049 --> 00:45:35,407
All this time, I've been imagining
the dead in our house

782
00:45:35,408 --> 00:45:37,277
and they're not even home.

783
00:45:37,278 --> 00:45:39,064
They went camping four days ago.

784
00:45:39,065 --> 00:45:41,687
"Driving home, we're
OK, I hope you are too. "

785
00:45:41,688 --> 00:45:44,977
Sent last night: "driving home".
That means, they'll probably meet us there.

786
00:45:44,978 --> 00:45:47,862
- I told you they were safe.
- They're on the road, maybe not.

787
00:45:47,863 --> 00:45:50,653
They're not safe,
but they're still alive.

788
00:45:50,654 --> 00:45:55,454
Pack your shit,
I'm gonna check on my gas.

789
00:46:04,603 --> 00:46:06,057
<i>Yo! Dude!</i>

790
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:08,835
<i>Where are you, man?</i>

791
00:46:08,836 --> 00:46:10,760
Ridley, yo back
at ya here.

792
00:46:10,761 --> 00:46:13,068
I'm in the middle of fuckin'
nowhere, out here.

793
00:46:13,069 --> 00:46:14,544
<i>How's Deb?</i>

794
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:17,878
She's OK.
You know, coping.

795
00:46:17,879 --> 00:46:22,765
<i>Look here, if you need anything,
like a place to chill or whatever!</i>

796
00:46:22,766 --> 00:46:25,574
<i>Get your ass
down here man!</i>

797
00:46:25,575 --> 00:46:27,498
<i>We're having
a blast!</i>

798
00:46:27,499 --> 00:46:29,916
<i>Hi J, love you.</i>

799
00:46:34,234 --> 00:46:36,509
- What's up?
- I don't know.

800
00:46:37,312 --> 00:46:39,012
Something’s going on.

801
00:46:40,967 --> 00:46:43,757
One of my men had a
bad heart. He died.

802
00:46:43,758 --> 00:46:46,933
The thing is, we don't
know where he went.

803
00:47:08,578 --> 00:47:09,878
Oh shit.

804
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:24,163
Finish the,
and lock the door.

805
00:47:24,164 --> 00:47:27,764
- I'm gonna get Jason.
- Stay, I'll go.

806
00:47:28,059 --> 00:47:30,704
Wait, that thing could
be inside there.

807
00:47:30,705 --> 00:47:33,105
That thing could
be anywhere...

808
00:47:45,136 --> 00:47:46,289
Fuck!

809
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:52,090
$100,000 education, and I can't find
my way out of a fuckin' warehouse!

810
00:47:58,123 --> 00:47:59,866
Exit.

811
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:07,150
What was that?

812
00:48:08,224 --> 00:48:09,524
Fuck!

813
00:48:11,399 --> 00:48:12,699
Fuck!

814
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:21,535
Where the hell
have you been?

815
00:48:21,536 --> 00:48:23,474
There's a dead guy
walking around. Let's go.

816
00:48:23,521 --> 00:48:25,444
Wait! Say it that again?
I didn't get it.

817
00:48:25,445 --> 00:48:28,535
There is a dead guy walking around.
Now, let's go.

818
00:48:49,111 --> 00:48:50,811
It's all clear.

819
00:48:56,326 --> 00:48:58,676
Turn that TV off!

820
00:49:02,098 --> 00:49:03,398
Alright.

821
00:49:03,927 --> 00:49:05,850
Everyone with a heartbeat,

822
00:49:05,851 --> 00:49:08,074
Freeze and shut up!

823
00:49:24,707 --> 00:49:27,407
Son of a bitch!
Where are we?

824
00:49:28,073 --> 00:49:29,373
Fuck.

825
00:49:34,508 --> 00:49:36,108
Fuck me!

826
00:49:37,213 --> 00:49:38,956
OK, never again.

827
00:49:42,792 --> 00:49:45,492
That's the door.
Let's go!

828
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:48,948
Let's go,
careful, OK?

829
00:49:48,949 --> 00:49:50,765
Shut the fuck up!

830
00:49:50,766 --> 00:49:52,778
I see him!
I see him over there!

831
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:55,485
Over here!

832
00:49:57,223 --> 00:49:58,523
Over here!

833
00:49:59,724 --> 00:50:01,374
Come on, we've got him!

834
00:50:02,706 --> 00:50:06,374
- We've got him!
- Over here!

835
00:50:12,327 --> 00:50:15,031
- Oh shit!
- It's not him.

836
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,804
Son of a bitch!

837
00:50:20,985 --> 00:50:22,335
Fuck off!

838
00:50:24,737 --> 00:50:28,262
Don't shoot!
Those barrels are full of gas!

839
00:50:38,302 --> 00:50:40,452
What the hell
is that stuff?

840
00:51:19,669 --> 00:51:20,727
That's enough.

841
00:51:20,728 --> 00:51:21,901
I need to fill the tank.

842
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:23,948
Stranton is only
65 miles away.

843
00:51:23,949 --> 00:51:27,796
- We need to bring in some weapons.
- Food, canned goods, water.

844
00:51:27,947 --> 00:51:31,312
- And lip gloss?
- The lip gloss, you can have.

845
00:51:31,313 --> 00:51:33,123
- The rest of the shit is ours.
- All of it?

846
00:51:33,866 --> 00:51:35,777
Every last can of peas.

847
00:51:36,216 --> 00:51:39,871
But, what if we say we're not
leaving till we get what we need?

848
00:51:39,872 --> 00:51:42,522
What would you do?
Kill us?

849
00:51:42,758 --> 00:51:43,804
I'd think about it.

850
00:51:43,805 --> 00:51:45,116
But I don't think
you'd do it though.

851
00:51:45,121 --> 00:51:47,299
It's easiest just to give us
what we need, isn't it?

852
00:51:47,857 --> 00:51:50,550
Cause otherwise, guess what?
You'll gonna have to kill us.

853
00:51:50,551 --> 00:51:52,676
- Deb.
- Shut up, J.

854
00:51:52,763 --> 00:51:53,864
You've gonna have
to kill us, because

855
00:51:53,865 --> 00:51:56,610
we're not leaving until
we get what we need!

856
00:52:03,923 --> 00:52:05,223
OK.

857
00:52:06,135 --> 00:52:07,710
Fill her up.

858
00:52:09,214 --> 00:52:11,714
Give them
what they want.

859
00:52:14,505 --> 00:52:16,524
Come and get 'em.

860
00:52:16,525 --> 00:52:18,500
- Is that enough for you?
- Come and get 'em!

861
00:52:18,619 --> 00:52:19,819
That will do.

862
00:52:20,374 --> 00:52:21,808
Gotta defend yourselves,
you've got to.

863
00:52:21,809 --> 00:52:22,851
Because if this
keeps up...

864
00:52:22,852 --> 00:52:24,866
people start to running
out of food, water, gas,

865
00:52:24,867 --> 00:52:26,893
they're gonna start
shooting at each other.

866
00:52:27,474 --> 00:52:31,821
No, think I've had enough
of this kind of thing.

867
00:52:31,822 --> 00:52:33,408
This I'll like.

868
00:52:33,409 --> 00:52:35,284
Now, this I prefer.

869
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:36,970
seems..

870
00:52:37,294 --> 00:52:39,145
friendlier,
somehow.

871
00:52:43,078 --> 00:52:44,378
Hey!

872
00:52:45,878 --> 00:52:49,028
I think you're a lot like me.

873
00:52:50,017 --> 00:52:51,592
Good luck.

874
00:52:52,423 --> 00:52:53,723
Good luck to
you too.

875
00:53:03,564 --> 00:53:04,927
What is that?

876
00:53:04,928 --> 00:53:06,146
Where's it
coming from?

877
00:53:06,261 --> 00:53:08,115
I found her on a message
board on YouTube.

878
00:53:08,116 --> 00:53:09,415
<i>Someone listen,</i>

879
00:53:10,028 --> 00:53:11,661
<i>We Tokyo.</i>

880
00:53:12,759 --> 00:53:16,120
<i>Very bad here.
Very bad Tokyo.</i>

881
00:53:16,121 --> 00:53:18,389
Tokyo. Can you
believe it?

882
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,834
There's hundreds of posts like this
all over the world.

883
00:53:21,896 --> 00:53:23,758
It's got technology.

884
00:53:28,558 --> 00:53:32,625
<i>Don't bury dead,
better shoot in head!</i>

885
00:53:33,736 --> 00:53:36,758
<i>Don't bury dead,
better shoot in head!</i>

886
00:53:37,966 --> 00:53:39,870
- Damn it!
- Well, plug it in!

887
00:53:39,871 --> 00:53:41,624
I just charged it!

888
00:53:42,309 --> 00:53:43,924
It's not the phone,
it's the service

889
00:53:44,045 --> 00:53:46,244
The fuckin' service,
is going out!

890
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:53,156
Nothing?
How can there be nothing?

891
00:53:55,084 --> 00:53:58,252
The towers, the relay towers
must be out. Jesus, all of them?

892
00:53:58,279 --> 00:54:01,416
Technology is terrific, Eliot.
Except, when it doesn't work!

893
00:54:01,532 --> 00:54:02,641
Great.

894
00:54:03,414 --> 00:54:07,189
It won't be long before nothing
works, starting nothing at all.

895
00:54:17,223 --> 00:54:20,525
<i>The mainstream has vanished,
with all its power and money.</i>

896
00:54:21,001 --> 00:54:25,937
<i>Now it was just us,
bloggers, hackers, kids.</i>

897
00:54:37,409 --> 00:54:41,259
<i>The more voices there are,
the more spin there is.</i>

898
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:43,744
<i>The truth becomes that
much harder to find.</i>

899
00:54:43,745 --> 00:54:47,554
<i>In the end,
it's all just... noise.</i>

900
00:55:01,023 --> 00:55:03,745
We're in Stranton.
This is Deb's house.

901
00:55:06,082 --> 00:55:09,011
- Thought they'd be here by now.
- They're what? Camping, right?

902
00:55:09,269 --> 00:55:10,376
And they what?

903
00:55:10,452 --> 00:55:11,809
They used to go to
some place in Virginia.

904
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:13,252
West-Virginia.

905
00:55:13,515 --> 00:55:16,058
You probably beat them here.
Maybe they hit traffic, or something.

906
00:55:16,059 --> 00:55:18,565
We didn't hit any traffic,
there is no traffic.

907
00:55:18,614 --> 00:55:20,686
West-Virginia is only
100 miles away.

908
00:55:20,687 --> 00:55:23,435
- Yeah, if that’s where they went.
- Yeah.

909
00:55:27,545 --> 00:55:29,469
I'm gonna
wait inside.

910
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:30,966
You guys should head
back on the road.

911
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:33,180
What?... and just
leave you here?

912
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:34,973
This where I grew up,
this is where I want to be.

913
00:55:34,974 --> 00:55:39,393
You guys all got homes too.
You should get going, get out of here.

914
00:55:39,394 --> 00:55:41,544
Thanks for
bringing me here.

915
00:55:41,795 --> 00:55:43,220
Thanks for
everything.

916
00:55:45,734 --> 00:55:50,249
- I guess I'll try to call you.
- I'll try to come back for you.

917
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,550
Sorry, J.

918
00:55:51,594 --> 00:55:55,340
Don't be an asshole.
Can't just let her wait here alone.

919
00:55:55,341 --> 00:56:00,216
Hey, do you mind, if maybe
I hang out for a while too?

920
00:56:01,713 --> 00:56:03,013
Yeah. OK.

921
00:56:04,018 --> 00:56:06,817
Me too? I need to pee again.

922
00:56:08,339 --> 00:56:09,587
I can't sit in
here anymore.

923
00:56:09,588 --> 00:56:12,084
I wanna meet your little brother,
maybe he has a Playstation.

924
00:56:12,085 --> 00:56:15,785
I'd like to meet your father,
maybe he has a bar.

925
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:18,444
We always hide a key.

926
00:56:26,876 --> 00:56:28,123
Shit.

927
00:56:28,124 --> 00:56:32,049
Fuck, I don't remember,
if it's 102 or 201.

928
00:56:36,288 --> 00:56:38,304
It's probably wiring in
the single circuit.

929
00:56:38,305 --> 00:56:41,980
- Where's the breaker box?
- In the garage.

930
00:56:52,616 --> 00:56:54,166
How you're doing?

931
00:56:55,496 --> 00:56:56,796
They're here?

932
00:56:58,666 --> 00:56:59,966
Mom?

933
00:57:00,299 --> 00:57:01,354
Dad!

934
00:57:01,355 --> 00:57:02,354
Billie!

935
00:57:02,355 --> 00:57:05,580
Maybe they dropped off their stuff
and went to the neighbors, or something.

936
00:57:05,581 --> 00:57:07,789
Maybe there was an evacuation,
like a mandatory evacuation..

937
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:09,998
- They would have taken their car?
- No, there's buses, right?

938
00:57:09,999 --> 00:57:14,624
Where they evacuate places,
they bring in, like buses and...

939
00:57:17,106 --> 00:57:19,039
Fuck!
Deb?

940
00:57:19,316 --> 00:57:20,616
What is it?

941
00:57:30,745 --> 00:57:33,241
OK, they must have, like had
an accident or something, right?

942
00:57:33,242 --> 00:57:34,873
Maybe. Maybe they're
at the hospital?

943
00:57:34,874 --> 00:57:37,562
I just hope its not a hospital
like we went to...

944
00:57:37,563 --> 00:57:38,863
OK.

945
00:57:39,677 --> 00:57:42,125
My dad would have been
driving, and...

946
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:45,918
That means my mom would
be in the passenger seat, so...

947
00:57:45,919 --> 00:57:47,744
that's my mom's blood.

948
00:57:48,513 --> 00:57:49,568
Yeah..

949
00:57:49,569 --> 00:57:54,466
and Billie would be in the back,
so that means, Billie is probably OK.

950
00:57:54,467 --> 00:57:57,059
- Debra.
- No, I'm sure Billie must be OK.

951
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:58,500
- Deb!
- What?

952
00:57:58,501 --> 00:58:02,293
OK. Listen to me,
You gotta know that this might be bad.

953
00:58:02,294 --> 00:58:06,567
I know. No, I do, I know OK.
Really, let's go inside, come on!

954
00:58:06,568 --> 00:58:09,449
OK, but don't think
about your parents.

955
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:11,466
Don't think about
your little brother.

956
00:58:11,467 --> 00:58:14,635
Wanna go in, I want you to
try to find something, OK?

957
00:58:14,636 --> 00:58:18,188
- Something like an old dog.
- Yeah, OK, an old dog.

958
00:58:18,189 --> 00:58:20,589
OK, What's her name?

959
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:23,951
- It's not a her, it's a him.
- A him. OK. You got a guy dog.

960
00:58:23,952 --> 00:58:26,544
Yes, like Ken.
Like Ken and Barbie.

961
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:29,334
OK, like Ken, but not Ken.
What is his name?

962
00:58:29,335 --> 00:58:30,788
What is his name?

963
00:58:34,328 --> 00:58:35,628
Michael.

964
00:58:36,633 --> 00:58:38,708
Like the Archangel.

965
00:58:39,898 --> 00:58:43,450
OK, so we're gonna go in there,
and look for Michael.

966
00:58:43,451 --> 00:58:44,751
OK.

967
00:58:45,659 --> 00:58:46,959
OK.

968
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:52,680
<i>I thought long and hard about
whether to leave this footage in the film.</i>

969
00:58:53,436 --> 00:58:59,100
<i>I decided, in the end,
to show you exactly what happened.</i>

970
00:58:59,101 --> 00:59:00,554
No! Billie!

971
00:59:00,632 --> 00:59:01,739
Out of the way.

972
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:03,438
Let me through!

973
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:05,683
Deb!

974
00:59:13,877 --> 00:59:15,477
No!

975
00:59:24,835 --> 00:59:26,135
Daddy?

976
00:59:26,179 --> 00:59:27,479
Mommy?

977
00:59:33,765 --> 00:59:35,065
Mommy.

978
00:59:41,927 --> 00:59:44,677
I think it’s time
we left this place.

979
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:59,977
<i>By now, we've become part of it,
part of 24/7.</i>

980
00:59:59,978 --> 01:00:02,775
<i>It's strange how,
looking at things,</i>

981
01:00:03,243 --> 01:00:06,232
<i>seeing things through a lens,
a glass.</i>

982
01:00:06,508 --> 01:00:09,387
<i>Rose colored or
shaded black.</i>

983
01:00:09,388 --> 01:00:11,038
<i>You become immune.</i>

984
01:00:11,309 --> 01:00:14,669
<i>You're supposed to be affected,
but you're not.</i>

985
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:19,867
<i>I used to think it was just you out there,
the viewers, but it's not.</i>

986
01:00:19,951 --> 01:00:21,403
<i>It's us as well.</i>

987
01:00:21,583 --> 01:00:22,939
<i>The shooters.</i>

988
01:00:23,024 --> 01:00:26,864
<i>We've become immune too, inoculated.</i>

989
01:00:26,865 --> 01:00:31,760
<i>So whatever happens around us,
no matter how horrible it is,</i>

990
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:34,833
<i>we just wind up
taking it all in stride.</i>

991
01:00:34,834 --> 01:00:36,809
<i>Just another day.</i>

992
01:00:37,427 --> 01:00:39,552
<i>Just another death.</i>

993
01:00:42,516 --> 01:00:45,166
It's gonna be OK, babe.

994
01:00:46,452 --> 01:00:48,231
Everything will be OK.

995
01:00:58,359 --> 01:01:00,859
Hey, do you want
to swap places?

996
01:01:02,584 --> 01:01:04,695
I could take the camera
for a while, and you could...

997
01:01:04,696 --> 01:01:07,496
Leave him alone,
Tracey.

998
01:01:08,249 --> 01:01:11,699
He's right where
he wants to be.

999
01:01:20,444 --> 01:01:23,294
Hey, where did you
learn to use that thing?

1000
01:01:24,668 --> 01:01:27,465
Archery squad.

1001
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:32,926
Targets of course,
that's all we do.

1002
01:01:32,927 --> 01:01:34,378
Life and death.

1003
01:01:37,728 --> 01:01:40,078
I had such
steady hands.

1004
01:01:40,128 --> 01:01:41,428
You still do.

1005
01:01:45,409 --> 01:01:46,709
Thank you.

1006
01:01:51,842 --> 01:01:55,478
Where's your home, professor?
Where was it?

1007
01:01:55,479 --> 01:01:59,904
Oxford..
That's where it was, such as it was.

1008
01:02:00,581 --> 01:02:03,706
Not really a home,
just a place.

1009
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:10,630
I've never seen
or imagined a home

1010
01:02:11,238 --> 01:02:14,113
that I would want to own.

1011
01:02:15,944 --> 01:02:18,619
- Sorry
- Not at all.

1012
01:02:20,457 --> 01:02:23,457
I'm a...
wandering spirit.

1013
01:02:24,105 --> 01:02:28,730
Yeah, he wanders to wherever
there's a bottle of spirits.

1014
01:02:31,979 --> 01:02:33,454
Unless...

1015
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:37,835
- Where're we going Eliot?
- We're going to the right place.

1016
01:02:37,836 --> 01:02:40,936
- We talked to Ridley.
- When?

1017
01:02:41,101 --> 01:02:43,981
- At the warehouse online.
- Is he OK?

1018
01:02:43,982 --> 01:02:47,341
Yeah, he really sounded great,
he invited us to come.

1019
01:02:47,342 --> 01:02:50,272
Philadelphia.
We can make it there before dawn.

1020
01:02:50,826 --> 01:02:52,267
Hey, hey, hey!

1021
01:02:52,624 --> 01:02:54,049
Look at this!

1022
01:02:55,403 --> 01:02:56,728
It's the guards.

1023
01:02:57,324 --> 01:02:59,545
It's the fuckin' Guards!

1024
01:03:02,511 --> 01:03:06,160
Call me crazy, but those guys
don't look dead.

1025
01:03:06,161 --> 01:03:09,686
You see? Told you
they'd show up.

1026
01:03:14,805 --> 01:03:16,105
Hi there.

1027
01:03:17,206 --> 01:03:20,656
- It's so nice to see you guys.
- Good.

1028
01:03:22,489 --> 01:03:26,639
- What's with the camera?
- Just making a movie.

1029
01:03:26,811 --> 01:03:28,111
Is that so?

1030
01:03:34,014 --> 01:03:36,414
Where did you get all the stuff?

1031
01:03:36,415 --> 01:03:37,772
Friends.

1032
01:03:40,257 --> 01:03:42,074
You know, seems to be
a whole lot of folks

1033
01:03:42,075 --> 01:03:45,278
getting a whole lot of stuff
from a whole lot of friends.

1034
01:03:47,461 --> 01:03:49,261
Can we be friends?

1035
01:03:51,495 --> 01:03:53,370
You wanna turn that off, son?

1036
01:03:56,394 --> 01:03:58,594
Turn the fucker off!

1037
01:04:01,388 --> 01:04:02,688
Now!

1038
01:04:18,388 --> 01:04:21,663
There’s your fuckin'
National Guard, Tony.

1039
01:04:23,959 --> 01:04:27,415
- They stole everything we got.
- Not everything, they left us our weapons..

1040
01:04:27,416 --> 01:04:30,969
- Yeah, they have their own...
- They're military men.

1041
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:32,335
With the world
been what it is

1042
01:04:32,336 --> 01:04:34,619
they know we wouldn't
survive without weapons.

1043
01:04:35,485 --> 01:04:38,173
They're not murderers,
just thieves.

1044
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:41,931
With the world being what it is.
I agree with that.

1045
01:04:42,016 --> 01:04:43,468
From now on...

1046
01:04:43,937 --> 01:04:47,406
Everyone who dies,
is gonna come back.

1047
01:04:47,971 --> 01:04:50,121
I mean, think about that.

1048
01:04:50,372 --> 01:04:54,021
Everyone who dies,
unless they get a bullet in the head,

1049
01:04:54,022 --> 01:04:57,767
is gonna come back,
and try to kill somebody else.

1050
01:04:57,768 --> 01:05:00,757
And on, and on, and on.

1051
01:05:02,858 --> 01:05:04,158
Forever.

1052
01:05:10,254 --> 01:05:12,929
<i>Get your helmet
cams on.</i>

1053
01:05:12,943 --> 01:05:14,863
<i>See anyone alive,
pull them out.</i>

1054
01:05:17,745 --> 01:05:19,720
Hey, is anyone
in there?

1055
01:05:20,627 --> 01:05:22,477
Anybody home?

1056
01:05:22,548 --> 01:05:25,427
- Hey, hold it!
- Don't go in there!

1057
01:05:25,428 --> 01:05:29,174
- Hold it, hold it!
- Are you all right, mister?

1058
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:32,151
- Take her with you.
- What are you hiding, old man?

1059
01:05:32,152 --> 01:05:33,702
No, please!

1060
01:05:45,311 --> 01:05:48,586
Nobody in here.
I don't see anything..

1061
01:05:52,803 --> 01:05:54,353
Son of a bitch!

1062
01:05:59,045 --> 01:06:01,120
Over there, behind you!

1063
01:06:09,611 --> 01:06:11,352
You fuckin' dick!

1064
01:06:12,491 --> 01:06:14,892
How'd you fuckin' get
to be in here?!

1065
01:06:14,893 --> 01:06:17,101
Look what
happened!

1066
01:06:17,102 --> 01:06:19,252
- They were family!
- Kill them!

1067
01:06:19,549 --> 01:06:21,490
- They were family!
- Kill the prick!

1068
01:06:21,664 --> 01:06:23,838
No, don't shoot!

1069
01:06:28,339 --> 01:06:30,068
Don't shoot them
in the head.

1070
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:31,239
Shoot them
in the heart.

1071
01:06:31,775 --> 01:06:35,281
Let them fuckin'
wake up dead.

1072
01:06:46,588 --> 01:06:50,730
They used to be...
us against us.

1073
01:06:55,221 --> 01:06:57,729
Now, it's us
against them..

1074
01:06:57,730 --> 01:07:00,335
<i>He was right,
us against them.</i>

1075
01:07:01,476 --> 01:07:02,976
<i>Except they</i>

1076
01:07:04,070 --> 01:07:05,370
<i>are us.</i>

1077
01:07:15,787 --> 01:07:17,203
We're here!
Here is it!

1078
01:07:17,792 --> 01:07:19,903
Wake up, Guys!
Come on, wake up!

1079
01:07:23,855 --> 01:07:25,631
Oh man, it's huge!

1080
01:07:25,632 --> 01:07:27,840
Looks like what god
might have built.

1081
01:07:27,841 --> 01:07:30,691
Only if he
had the money.

1082
01:07:33,318 --> 01:07:35,814
Ridley made this place
so much like a fortress.

1083
01:07:35,815 --> 01:07:41,003
I've never been to a fortress before,
but don't they usually keep the doors locked?

1084
01:07:41,004 --> 01:07:45,579
- I told you, he said everything was cool.
- Well, that was yesterday.

1085
01:08:10,115 --> 01:08:11,890
Plenty of security.

1086
01:08:12,709 --> 01:08:14,629
There got to be monitors
around here, somewhere.

1087
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:17,032
Monitors don't do us any good,
while somebody's watching.

1088
01:08:17,033 --> 01:08:20,683
Somebody might be watching us.
Right now.

1089
01:08:20,779 --> 01:08:22,554
OK, let’s go in.

1090
01:08:23,661 --> 01:08:26,639
No, wait, wait, go back.
Step back.

1091
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,990
I wanna cover everything.

1092
01:08:35,286 --> 01:08:37,861
OK, ready, come in.

1093
01:08:46,816 --> 01:08:48,736
I can't do this anymore.

1094
01:08:48,737 --> 01:08:51,137
Every time we walk in somewhere,
somebody dies.

1095
01:08:51,138 --> 01:08:52,564
Or somebody already died.

1096
01:08:52,565 --> 01:08:54,789
It's gonna be the same
wherever we go.

1097
01:08:54,790 --> 01:08:56,690
Shut the door.

1098
01:09:01,227 --> 01:09:02,527
Ridley?

1099
01:09:03,629 --> 01:09:04,929
Ridley!

1100
01:09:05,551 --> 01:09:07,771
Francine?
Hello!

1101
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:15,066
Hey Max!

1102
01:09:17,079 --> 01:09:18,379
Ridley?

1103
01:09:31,971 --> 01:09:33,892
This is where the party was.

1104
01:09:33,893 --> 01:09:35,193
Good lord!

1105
01:09:35,814 --> 01:09:38,323
Treasures.
Absolute treasures.

1106
01:09:39,176 --> 01:09:41,770
"A Tale of Two Cities. "

1107
01:09:41,771 --> 01:09:42,747
First edition.

1108
01:09:42,748 --> 01:09:45,901
You have any ideas
how much this is worth?

1109
01:09:45,902 --> 01:09:50,527
It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times.

1110
01:09:52,627 --> 01:09:55,027
Ridley! You scared us
half to dead!

1111
01:09:55,028 --> 01:10:00,997
You came! This is great, this is so
fuckin' great to have all you guys here!

1112
01:10:01,754 --> 01:10:04,071
- Where’s Francine?
- Where are your parents?

1113
01:10:05,597 --> 01:10:07,038
Why was the front
door open?

1114
01:10:07,039 --> 01:10:08,664
Oh, what that?

1115
01:10:08,767 --> 01:10:12,321
I was outside, just came back in.
Must not have shut it behind me.

1116
01:10:12,322 --> 01:10:15,492
Stupid. You know me,
I'm stupid.

1117
01:10:15,493 --> 01:10:16,818
What's in there?

1118
01:10:17,607 --> 01:10:18,985
Panic room.

1119
01:10:19,184 --> 01:10:21,929
Wow, what's going on,
why were you in there?

1120
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:25,195
Just checking the generator,
that's all, everything's fine.

1121
01:10:25,196 --> 01:10:26,829
Even better now,
that you're here.

1122
01:10:26,830 --> 01:10:32,126
Guys! Hell, it's such so great
to have you guys here!

1123
01:10:33,267 --> 01:10:34,515
You must be
totally burned.

1124
01:10:34,516 --> 01:10:37,013
What can I get for you?
Something to eat? Drink?

1125
01:10:37,014 --> 01:10:40,664
- A cocktail would be lovely.
- The bar is up right over there.

1126
01:10:40,665 --> 01:10:43,930
I'll love to get this damn
corset off me now, please.

1127
01:10:43,931 --> 01:10:45,852
You know,
what I like?

1128
01:10:45,853 --> 01:10:48,278
A long, hot bath.

1129
01:10:48,282 --> 01:10:51,596
Take a bathroom. We've got six.
Clean towels, shampoo, soap.

1130
01:10:51,597 --> 01:10:53,496
Whatever you'll need.
Whatever.

1131
01:10:54,979 --> 01:10:57,320
So, nobody's tried to
break in or anything?

1132
01:10:57,321 --> 01:10:59,109
Nobody around
to break in.

1133
01:10:59,110 --> 01:11:01,224
We're pretty
isolated out here.

1134
01:11:01,225 --> 01:11:03,723
Country Club is closer than
the next house, but...

1135
01:11:03,724 --> 01:11:07,858
not too many people are interested
in golf or tennis these days.

1136
01:11:07,859 --> 01:11:09,484
Where's your stuff?

1137
01:11:09,782 --> 01:11:12,237
You must have brought
some stuff with you.

1138
01:11:12,238 --> 01:11:13,819
Dirty clothes.
Bags of them.

1139
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:15,838
Well, bring it in!
Bring it all in!

1140
01:11:15,839 --> 01:11:18,819
Something tells me, you're
going to be here for a while.

1141
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:20,165
I'm going to
the Winni.

1142
01:11:20,166 --> 01:11:22,761
I'll come with you, I'd like to grab
that out of the camera.

1143
01:11:22,762 --> 01:11:25,212
X-1's never enough.

1144
01:11:25,934 --> 01:11:27,290
Here, you take
this one.

1145
01:11:27,384 --> 01:11:29,490
I don't know. I don't wanna
make this kind of movie.

1146
01:11:29,491 --> 01:11:32,856
I don't want to movie this kind of
movie either, but I can't change the script!

1147
01:11:32,857 --> 01:11:36,221
- Here, see if you can resist.
- I don't want to do this.

1148
01:11:36,222 --> 01:11:39,406
Jason! I don't
want to do this!

1149
01:11:51,894 --> 01:11:54,019
My father shot a rabbit!

1150
01:11:58,816 --> 01:12:00,866
I thought it was in here.

1151
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:08,880
Tony, you're filming.

1152
01:12:08,911 --> 01:12:12,276
I guess Jason was right,
you can't resist.

1153
01:12:12,277 --> 01:12:16,590
I'm filming you Ridley, because
you're acting a little weird.

1154
01:12:16,821 --> 01:12:18,768
All that shit, that
has been going on.

1155
01:12:19,177 --> 01:12:20,315
I know.

1156
01:12:21,309 --> 01:12:22,527
I know what's
going on.

1157
01:12:23,441 --> 01:12:25,866
I just feel a
little bit tired and...

1158
01:12:26,131 --> 01:12:27,432
felt a little drunk,

1159
01:12:28,435 --> 01:12:29,735
That's all.

1160
01:12:30,644 --> 01:12:32,563
- Forget the rabbits.
- Ridley.

1161
01:12:34,004 --> 01:12:36,596
Father shot two of them. They are
downstairs in one of those big freezers.

1162
01:12:36,597 --> 01:12:39,972
Ridley, can we look for
Francine now?

1163
01:12:40,726 --> 01:12:42,562
She's out back.

1164
01:12:42,647 --> 01:12:45,430
With my family
and the staff.

1165
01:12:45,431 --> 01:12:49,206
Right, you said that.
Why don't we go see her?

1166
01:12:50,617 --> 01:12:52,892
I don't think we
should do that.

1167
01:12:53,017 --> 01:12:54,950
- Why?
- Well...

1168
01:12:55,801 --> 01:12:57,638
To begin with...

1169
01:12:58,010 --> 01:12:59,558
Father's dead.

1170
01:13:00,027 --> 01:13:04,731
He was the first one to die, then he did
mother, and then they did the staff.

1171
01:13:04,732 --> 01:13:07,720
Brannigan, Brenda, Cook.

1172
01:13:08,189 --> 01:13:10,339
Really liked Cook.

1173
01:13:10,493 --> 01:13:12,412
Maybe she ate the rabbit?

1174
01:13:12,413 --> 01:13:15,188
Did somebody
eat Francine?

1175
01:13:17,215 --> 01:13:20,340
Did somebody
eat Francine?

1176
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:21,683
No.

1177
01:13:22,976 --> 01:13:24,276
Well..

1178
01:13:25,665 --> 01:13:30,478
Not exactly,
Brannigan bit her on the face.

1179
01:13:31,426 --> 01:13:34,882
I think. I don't know,
it all happened so fast.

1180
01:13:34,883 --> 01:13:37,476
- I think we should get out of here.
- Wait, wait, Ridley!

1181
01:13:37,477 --> 01:13:40,548
- Your saying they're all dead?
- Yes.

1182
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:42,599
I had to bury them.

1183
01:13:46,983 --> 01:13:48,958
Is no one else hungry?

1184
01:13:51,687 --> 01:13:56,962
I didn't bury them in the garden,
I'd never dig up mother's roses.

1185
01:13:57,544 --> 01:13:59,344
That's OK, come on

1186
01:13:59,466 --> 01:14:04,441
I had to chop off Cook's hand,
that's why there's so much blood.

1187
01:14:06,668 --> 01:14:07,968
Francine.

1188
01:14:09,547 --> 01:14:10,847
Come on!

1189
01:14:17,710 --> 01:14:21,550
- Maybe we should get out of here.
- No, I got to see this.

1190
01:14:21,551 --> 01:14:22,851
Guys!

1191
01:14:38,643 --> 01:14:41,068
It's a little hard to see.

1192
01:14:41,332 --> 01:14:43,482
Here, I'll turn on the lights.

1193
01:14:47,669 --> 01:14:49,794
This is where I've
buried them.

1194
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:57,668
Sweet Jesus.

1195
01:15:00,728 --> 01:15:03,653
- He's gone.
- There was blood on his arms.

1196
01:15:03,801 --> 01:15:05,601
I wonder if he
got bitten?

1197
01:15:48,933 --> 01:15:50,233
Guys?

1198
01:15:55,846 --> 01:15:57,146
Guys?

1199
01:16:21,676 --> 01:16:24,762
- Jason! A little help here.
- I'm shooting.

1200
01:16:28,782 --> 01:16:31,482
Oh, Ridley. Can you
give me hand?

1201
01:16:33,583 --> 01:16:34,883
Jesus!

1202
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:37,673
Oh shit.
He's fuckin' dead!

1203
01:16:40,306 --> 01:16:41,606
Oh fuck!

1204
01:16:43,666 --> 01:16:48,287
- Jason! A little help here?
- Run! Run, Tracey!

1205
01:16:56,149 --> 01:17:00,374
See? I told you these
things move slow.

1206
01:17:03,352 --> 01:17:05,503
Where the fuck
did they go?

1207
01:17:08,151 --> 01:17:09,451
Tracey?

1208
01:17:09,593 --> 01:17:10,893
Tracey!

1209
01:17:11,993 --> 01:17:13,293
Tracey!

1210
01:17:14,394 --> 01:17:15,694
Oh shit!

1211
01:17:16,218 --> 01:17:18,810
I can’t fuckin'
believe this!

1212
01:17:18,811 --> 01:17:21,886
This is like a goddamn
mummy movie!

1213
01:17:22,075 --> 01:17:26,125
Jason, put down that stupid
camera and come help me!

1214
01:17:30,718 --> 01:17:34,868
Get that Jason?
I hope you're happy, you son of a bitch!

1215
01:17:38,399 --> 01:17:40,139
Cut! Cut!

1216
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:45,420
- This isn't a movie, Jason, its real!
- I'm trying to distract it. Cut! Cut!

1217
01:17:52,323 --> 01:17:54,548
Tell him,
I'm from Texas.

1218
01:18:04,327 --> 01:18:05,627
Tracey!

1219
01:18:07,495 --> 01:18:08,795
Tracey!

1220
01:18:09,415 --> 01:18:13,965
I'm leaving you, Jason.
You do the house, I'll do the car.

1221
01:18:20,171 --> 01:18:21,471
Francine!

1222
01:18:21,611 --> 01:18:23,914
- I don't believe this!
- What, is she nuts?

1223
01:18:23,915 --> 01:18:28,840
- Where does she thinks she's going?
- Well, she's not going for Chinese!.

1224
01:18:30,732 --> 01:18:31,788
You know what? It's OK..

1225
01:18:31,789 --> 01:18:33,504
We still got Ridley's car

1226
01:18:33,647 --> 01:18:35,221
there's other cars in the garage,
we can still get out of here.

1227
01:18:35,222 --> 01:18:36,249
No, bad idea.

1228
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:38,990
Look, Ridley's mother and others are
moping around somewhere, dead or alive.

1229
01:18:38,991 --> 01:18:42,341
And there are human
goldfish in the fuckin' pool.

1230
01:18:42,735 --> 01:18:45,328
We just spent the last two days on the road.
Did you have a good time?

1231
01:18:45,329 --> 01:18:47,728
- No, but...
- Out there, we're lunch.

1232
01:18:47,729 --> 01:18:52,240
In here, there's a steel reinforced panic room,
where we could sit and play Nintendo.

1233
01:18:52,241 --> 01:18:54,716
Until this whole
thing blows over.

1234
01:19:21,193 --> 01:19:24,806
- It's me.
- Jesus.

1235
01:19:25,466 --> 01:19:30,459
- Where's Ridley? Have you seen him?
- Yeah, he's not Ridley anymore.

1236
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:31,760
He's something else.

1237
01:19:32,572 --> 01:19:34,588
Eliot is something
else too, I'm afraid.

1238
01:19:34,589 --> 01:19:35,588
What?!

1239
01:19:35,589 --> 01:19:37,014
All gone.

1240
01:19:38,909 --> 01:19:42,077
He died in a tub of water,
with Ridley in his arms.

1241
01:19:42,078 --> 01:19:43,077
How do you
know all this?

1242
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:47,743
I saw it on TV, darling. I took my bourbon
and I went in to watch the monitors.

1243
01:19:47,744 --> 01:19:49,911
I went into that
panic room, which

1244
01:19:49,912 --> 01:19:52,787
I suggest is the good place
for us all go right now.

1245
01:19:57,442 --> 01:20:00,993
Always wanted my
own swashbuckler.

1246
01:20:00,994 --> 01:20:03,875
- Your drunk, Professor?
- Indeed I am.

1247
01:20:03,876 --> 01:20:06,276
The drunkenness
have oddly.

1248
01:20:06,277 --> 01:20:10,788
Regretfully, never twisted my perception
of things I'd rather run with.

1249
01:20:10,789 --> 01:20:12,324
Tracey's phone.

1250
01:20:12,325 --> 01:20:14,200
- Let's go.
- No.

1251
01:20:14,437 --> 01:20:15,436
Jason!

1252
01:20:15,437 --> 01:20:17,606
We can't just lock ourselves
in the fuckin' room.

1253
01:20:17,607 --> 01:20:20,487
- We'll be locking ourselves out the world.
- That's the whole point.

1254
01:20:20,488 --> 01:20:23,656
We lock ourselves out the world,
before the world bites us on the ass.

1255
01:20:23,657 --> 01:20:27,401
We've got weapons.
We can take care of whatever comes.

1256
01:20:27,402 --> 01:20:29,321
We can't go
in there, Deb.

1257
01:20:29,322 --> 01:20:31,338
I'll miss...
I'll miss everything.

1258
01:20:31,339 --> 01:20:34,989
God damn it, Jason,
will you stop this?!

1259
01:20:35,083 --> 01:20:38,083
Come with us.
Be safe.

1260
01:20:38,252 --> 01:20:40,268
Settle, like I'm
trying to do.

1261
01:20:40,269 --> 01:20:42,188
- Settle, for...
- What?

1262
01:20:42,189 --> 01:20:44,301
For life.
For survival.

1263
01:20:44,302 --> 01:20:47,949
Survival? Who the fuck wants
to survive in a world like this?

1264
01:20:47,950 --> 01:20:52,144
All that's left, is to record
what's happening for

1265
01:20:52,145 --> 01:20:54,296
whoever remains
when it's over.

1266
01:20:57,169 --> 01:20:58,469
Please.

1267
01:21:00,530 --> 01:21:03,180
I don't wanna go in
there without you.

1268
01:21:09,363 --> 01:21:10,663
Alright.

1269
01:21:23,383 --> 01:21:24,683
I can't.

1270
01:21:34,906 --> 01:21:36,231
What was that?

1271
01:21:37,315 --> 01:21:39,290
Where the hell is he?

1272
01:21:42,592 --> 01:21:43,892
Oh no!

1273
01:21:48,348 --> 01:21:49,898
Oh god, No!

1274
01:22:12,808 --> 01:22:14,108
J...

1275
01:22:29,116 --> 01:22:30,416
Kill me.

1276
01:22:35,831 --> 01:22:37,131
No.

1277
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:53,685
Michael...
the Archangel.

1278
01:23:00,772 --> 01:23:03,744
Hi, my name is J.
Jason Creed.

1279
01:23:03,745 --> 01:23:07,677
and I have been given the
opportunity, given the gift

1280
01:23:07,678 --> 01:23:12,186
to be able to document the events,
that has suddenly, landed on my lap.

1281
01:23:12,187 --> 01:23:15,448
and I just wanted to let you guys
know, the audience know, that...

1282
01:23:15,449 --> 01:23:18,326
I'm gonna do my best, to capture
the truth, with me and my friends.

1283
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:21,846
Which gonna be no fakeyness,
I'm gonna go after everything...

1284
01:23:21,847 --> 01:23:23,505
really raw, really real,

1285
01:23:23,506 --> 01:23:26,767
and I'm going to do the best job I can...

1286
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:29,069
and I'm really excited,
to be given this opportunity,

1287
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:31,768
and I'm not
gonna fuck it up.

1288
01:23:33,387 --> 01:23:35,605
Yeah..

1289
01:23:37,224 --> 01:23:38,524
Debby?

1290
01:23:38,663 --> 01:23:39,963
Debra!

1291
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:43,320
Debra!

1292
01:23:57,368 --> 01:23:58,668
Deb?

1293
01:24:00,726 --> 01:24:02,944
I'm gonna
finish his movie.

1294
01:24:10,799 --> 01:24:12,199
The movie's off.

1295
01:24:12,717 --> 01:24:14,017
No.

1296
01:24:15,595 --> 01:24:17,795
There's gonna
be more.

1297
01:24:19,623 --> 01:24:21,823
There's gotta
be more.

1298
01:24:29,503 --> 01:24:31,278
Morning approaches.

1299
01:24:31,518 --> 01:24:34,299
Things always look
better in the morning.

1300
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:35,725
Not to me.

1301
01:24:36,219 --> 01:24:40,419
Mornings bring light,
I prefer the darkness.

1302
01:24:41,016 --> 01:24:43,891
It's easier to
hide in the dark.

1303
01:24:43,893 --> 01:24:46,843
You know professor,
they actually get the...

1304
01:24:47,730 --> 01:24:53,964
mornings, they show you for what you are,
instead of what you think you are.

1305
01:24:53,965 --> 01:24:58,282
In-elegantly phrased, Mr. Ravello,
but accurately put.

1306
01:24:58,283 --> 01:24:59,583
Mornings.

1307
01:25:00,393 --> 01:25:01,747
And mirrors.

1308
01:25:03,462 --> 01:25:06,037
I despise them.

1309
01:25:06,244 --> 01:25:09,730
Mornings and mirrors
only serve to terrify old men.

1310
01:25:09,987 --> 01:25:11,408
Hey!

1311
01:25:11,424 --> 01:25:12,670
Can you say
that again?

1312
01:25:12,671 --> 01:25:13,971
I didn't get that.

1313
01:25:16,507 --> 01:25:17,807
The truth,
darling.

1314
01:25:17,947 --> 01:25:19,444
Look at this!

1315
01:25:41,065 --> 01:25:43,040
Close the door!

1316
01:25:50,850 --> 01:25:53,822
<i>Jason once said he
thought he could help.</i>

1317
01:25:53,823 --> 01:25:56,605
<i>Maybe even
save some lives.</i>

1318
01:25:56,606 --> 01:26:00,634
<i>This is the last thing he
downloaded before he died.</i>

1319
01:26:00,635 --> 01:26:04,435
<i>A couple of hometown Joes,
who were out shooting targets.</i>

1320
01:26:04,471 --> 01:26:06,293
<i>That day, they
used people.</i>

1321
01:26:06,294 --> 01:26:07,827
<i>Dead people.</i>

1322
01:26:07,828 --> 01:26:10,078
<i>You know,
just for fun.</i>

1323
01:26:11,187 --> 01:26:14,543
<i>There was one target
different from the rest.</i>

1324
01:26:14,544 --> 01:26:18,819
<i>A woman, tied by her
hair to the branch of a tree.</i>

1325
01:26:18,861 --> 01:26:21,737
<i>The boys had this one setup
just for kicks.</i>

1326
01:26:21,738 --> 01:26:24,913
<i>They got out their
favorite 12 gauge and...</i>

1327
01:26:27,973 --> 01:26:30,423
<i>Are we worth saving?</i>

1328
01:26:30,756 --> 01:26:32,456
<i>You tell me.</i>
