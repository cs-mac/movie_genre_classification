1
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,710
<i>If I spoke about it...</i>

2
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:54,281
<i>If I did...</i>

3
00:01:55,113 --> 00:01:57,548
<i>what would I tell you?</i>

4
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,918
<i>I wonder.</i>

5
00:02:00,986 --> 00:02:03,421
<i>Would I tell you
about the time?</i>

6
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:06,156
<i>It happened a long time ago,
it seems...</i>

7
00:02:06,158 --> 00:02:09,361
<i>in the last days
of a fair prince's reign.</i>

8
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:13,366
<i>Or would I tell you
about the place?</i>

9
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:17,001
<i>A small city near the coast...</i>

10
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:19,372
<i>but far from everything else.</i>

11
00:02:22,808 --> 00:02:24,677
<i>Or, I don't know.</i>

12
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,181
<i>Would I tell you about her?</i>

13
00:02:29,348 --> 00:02:31,718
<i>The princess without voice.</i>

14
00:02:34,052 --> 00:02:36,187
<i>Or perhaps
I would just warn you</i>

15
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:38,158
<i>about the truth
of these facts...</i>

16
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,628
<i>and the tale
of love and loss...</i>

17
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:48,201
<i>and the monster who tried
to destroy it all.</i>

18
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:43,253
<i>My Lord Hedak.</i>

19
00:03:43,255 --> 00:03:46,991
<i>So, you are troubled.
Tell me.</i>

20
00:03:49,828 --> 00:03:51,528
<i>I've...</i>

21
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:55,331
<i>I have sinned.
I've offended the god.</i>

22
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,266
<i>I am deep in sin,
my Lord Hedak.</i>

23
00:03:57,268 --> 00:03:58,836
<i>Let me judge of that.</i>

24
00:04:01,273 --> 00:04:04,442
<i>I've doubted the ceremony
of the sacrifice.</i>

25
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:25,021
<i>I don't want to go up there.</i>

26
00:05:25,023 --> 00:05:27,891
<i>Why, everybody's got
to go upstairs, Miss Lloyd,</i>

27
00:05:27,893 --> 00:05:30,394
<i>if they wants to go to bed.</i>

28
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:33,631
The sirens wake you up?
There was a fire.

29
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,535
The chocolate factory.

30
00:05:37,836 --> 00:05:39,202
Do you smell that?

31
00:05:39,204 --> 00:05:41,038
Oh, my!

32
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,408
Toasted cocoa.

33
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:46,179
Tragedy and delight,
hand in hand.

34
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:49,980
Oh, my dear child.

35
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:53,149
I would waste away if you
weren't here looking after me.

36
00:05:53,151 --> 00:05:55,252
I am the proverbial
starving...

37
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:57,588
Watch this.

38
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,226
It's Bojangles,
the stair dance.

39
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,327
Oh, that's so hard.
Cagney did it.

40
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:05,797
Different, but beautiful.

41
00:06:07,365 --> 00:06:09,466
<i>- I wanna do that, too.
- All right!</i>

42
00:06:09,468 --> 00:06:10,934
<i>- Are you ready?
- Yup.</i>

43
00:06:10,936 --> 00:06:12,134
<i>Come on.</i>

44
00:06:12,136 --> 00:06:14,641
<i>Ah!</i>

45
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:17,910
<i>Say, you catch on quick.</i>

46
00:06:19,244 --> 00:06:21,213
<i>Look out now.
Here's your last one!</i>

47
00:06:56,514 --> 00:06:57,514
Elisa!

48
00:06:58,316 --> 00:07:00,283
Next time you come
to bring the rent...

49
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:03,420
I want you to stay
and see the Bible movie, huh!

50
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:05,021
I have... I have two
free tickets here.

51
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:07,757
You bring your neighbor Giles.
He's a good boy.

52
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,228
Bible movie and comedy!

53
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,160
Nobody's coming
to the theater, huh?

54
00:07:11,162 --> 00:07:14,598
I'll throw in a free
popcorn and soda!

55
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,565
Oh, no!

56
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:17,567
For God's sake,
there are two "S's" there!

57
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:21,637
Come on! Two "S."
"Mardi Grass!" "Mardi Grass!"

58
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,706
Two "S."

59
00:08:27,271 --> 00:08:29,372
<i>All new personnel,
be advised that sector 12</i>

60
00:08:29,374 --> 00:08:31,242
<i>has now been cleared
to level A safety.</i>

61
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:35,010
Elisa! Come on.
I'm here already.

62
00:08:35,012 --> 00:08:36,278
You gotta learn to be on time.

63
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,948
Hey! What are you doing?
Don't cut in, dummy!

64
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,085
Leave her alone, woman.
I was keeping her place.

65
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:44,087
I get reported, I come
after you and the mute.

66
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:46,925
You do that, Yolanda.
You do that.

67
00:09:00,372 --> 00:09:03,306
My feet are already
killing me.

68
00:09:03,308 --> 00:09:05,374
I made Brewster
pigs in a blanket

69
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:07,177
tonight before leaving...

70
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:10,179
and boy, he just ate 'em up.

71
00:09:10,181 --> 00:09:12,716
No "thank-yous",
no "yum-yums".

72
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,551
Not a peep.

73
00:09:14,553 --> 00:09:17,153
Man is as silent as a grave.

74
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:19,589
But if farts were flattery...

75
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:22,426
honey, he'd be Shakespeare.

76
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,794
Then I get home
and I make him breakfast.

77
00:09:24,796 --> 00:09:27,331
Eggs, bacon,
and buttered toast.

78
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,365
I butter
the man's toast, Elisa.

79
00:09:29,367 --> 00:09:31,033
Mmm-hmm, both sides....

80
00:09:31,035 --> 00:09:32,436
as if he was a child.

81
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,705
And I don't even
get a thank-you.

82
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,807
You'd be grateful

83
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:38,674
because you're
an educated woman.

84
00:09:38,676 --> 00:09:40,543
But my Brewster,
all he had going for him

85
00:09:40,545 --> 00:09:42,745
was animal magnetism
back in the day.

86
00:09:42,747 --> 00:09:45,115
Hasn't worked in a while.

87
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,850
What in the Sam Hill? No!

88
00:09:47,852 --> 00:09:50,286
You boys mind putting
the trash in the can?

89
00:09:50,288 --> 00:09:51,824
That's what it's there for.

90
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,392
Hard to believe, huh?
That's what it's there for.

91
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:57,027
All right, all right.
Sorry, Zelda! Sorry!

92
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,662
I don't know
what they're doing.

93
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,563
Making a goddamn mess
is what I think.

94
00:10:00,565 --> 00:10:03,067
Zelda!
Stop that chatter, please.

95
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,234
Yes, sir.

96
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:06,503
There's no call
for the blasphemy.

97
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:08,441
Sorry, Mr. Fleming, sir.

98
00:10:10,575 --> 00:10:12,808
A moment of your time!

99
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,078
Today, we are receiving
a new team

100
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,279
and asset here in T-4.

101
00:10:17,281 --> 00:10:18,615
This is Dr. Robert Hoffstetler

102
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:20,717
from our sister facility
in Galveston.

103
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:24,922
Now, I don't wanna bolster
or overstate the matter

104
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:28,692
but this may very well be
the most sensitive asset

105
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:31,528
ever to be housed
in this facility.

106
00:10:49,147 --> 00:10:52,581
- How was your trip?
- Fine. Who's security here?

107
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,587
Just one moment, please.

108
00:10:55,853 --> 00:10:59,089
Security! Who's security?

109
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:00,758
Welcome to T-4, sir.

110
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,859
Yes, sir, I am Fleming,
head of Security.

111
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:05,227
And if there are questions
you have or concerns...

112
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:06,529
you just come talk to me.

113
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:19,978
Do you understand?
I'll be in charge from now on.

114
00:11:34,425 --> 00:11:36,145
Get them out.

115
00:11:37,795 --> 00:11:40,230
Help me move this
cylinder into the compressor.

116
00:11:44,169 --> 00:11:45,771
Bring it here.
Bring it here.

117
00:11:49,473 --> 00:11:51,908
Bring it over here.
There. Mount the cylinder.

118
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,509
We need to pressurize it
immediately.

119
00:11:53,511 --> 00:11:55,982
- From there to there.
- Elisa! Elisa!

120
00:11:56,848 --> 00:11:58,282
Come on!

121
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,450
Lord, what goes on
in this place?

122
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:01,518
Did you see that?

123
00:12:21,506 --> 00:12:23,005
Yes, I'm wearing
the hairpiece.

124
00:12:23,007 --> 00:12:23,940
How does it look?

125
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:26,578
Oh! Be careful of the car.

126
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,446
And it's not a hairpiece.

127
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:31,583
It's a toupee. It's French.

128
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:34,317
<i>It's eternal, see?</i>

129
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:37,754
Tantalus never achieved
the escape of death....

130
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,456
because the fruit
on the branches

131
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,658
was just always
out of his reach...

132
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,360
and the water
in the stream receded

133
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,162
every time he
stooped down to drink.

134
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,898
And so that's why
we say things today like...

135
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,469
"Look at those
tantalizing pies."

136
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:55,607
Thank you!
Y'all come back now, you hear?

137
00:12:56,341 --> 00:12:58,140
Yes, pies for breakfast.

138
00:12:58,142 --> 00:12:59,711
Just trust me on this.

139
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:03,813
Hey, folks!
Welcome to Dixie Doug's.

140
00:13:03,815 --> 00:13:05,414
I've seen you
in here before, right?

141
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:06,716
Yes.

142
00:13:06,718 --> 00:13:08,284
I've been here a couple
of times, as a matter of fact.

143
00:13:08,286 --> 00:13:09,619
Partial to key lime pie?

144
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:13,456
I am, I am.
Two to go.

145
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,624
Just go with it,
please. Please.

146
00:13:15,626 --> 00:13:19,096
Uh, I, uh, it's a craving
that I indulge in.

147
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:22,032
Can't possibly be good for me,
but nothing I like is.

148
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:24,734
No, no, it's a mighty
fine pie, key lime.

149
00:13:24,736 --> 00:13:25,869
You wouldn't happen to be

150
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,470
the famous "Dixie Doug"
himself, would you?

151
00:13:27,472 --> 00:13:28,639
Oh, heck no.

152
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,072
The pies are trucked
throughout the country.

153
00:13:30,074 --> 00:13:32,676
- They call it "franchising," see?
- Oh.

154
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,610
They give us the spinners,
the signage.

155
00:13:34,612 --> 00:13:36,547
That there's "Pie Boy,"
our mascot.

156
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:37,679
I don't talk like that.

157
00:13:37,681 --> 00:13:40,017
I'm from Ottawa.

158
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,020
No.

159
00:13:41,819 --> 00:13:43,955
I completely bought it.

160
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,325
"That's-a-great-a-pie."

161
00:13:49,761 --> 00:13:51,894
The... The, uh...

162
00:13:51,896 --> 00:13:54,766
The little... little guy,
is he supposed to be Italian?

163
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:56,899
I guess so.

164
00:13:56,901 --> 00:13:58,737
Well, it's very clever.

165
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:04,076
Y'all come back now, you hear?

166
00:14:06,377 --> 00:14:08,079
"Y'all come back now."

167
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:12,716
Do you think he meant it?

168
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:15,353
He had noticed me.
I mean, you... you heard that.

169
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:21,191
This pie is rather sordid.

170
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,759
But don't spit it out.

171
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:23,894
Next time we go,

172
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,729
we'll just try
a different flavor. Hmm?

173
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,100
Save it for later,
put it away.

174
00:14:31,102 --> 00:14:33,903
<i>6:00 AM eastern standard time.</i>

175
00:14:33,905 --> 00:14:35,345
<i>The skies are beginning
to lighten...</i>

176
00:14:36,974 --> 00:14:39,176
<i>as a cool North wind rustles across...</i>

177
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,644
<i>...groups of
Negroes have been swarming</i>

178
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:42,611
<i>in front of and behind
the advancing police.</i>

179
00:14:42,613 --> 00:14:44,548
Oh, dear God!
Change that awfulness.

180
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,419
I do not wanna see that.

181
00:14:47,752 --> 00:14:49,155
I do not wanna see it.

182
00:14:52,122 --> 00:14:54,624
Oh, that's better,
that's better.

183
00:14:54,626 --> 00:14:56,592
Oh, look at Betty.

184
00:14:56,594 --> 00:14:58,595
Oh, God, to be young
and beautiful.

185
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:02,032
If I could go back
to when I was 18...

186
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,466
I didn't know anything
about anything,

187
00:15:03,468 --> 00:15:05,070
I'd give myself
a bit of advice.

188
00:15:06,804 --> 00:15:09,306
I would say, "Take better
care of your teeth...

189
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,173
and fuck a lot more."

190
00:15:11,175 --> 00:15:13,076
Oh no, no, that's very good advice.

191
00:16:05,896 --> 00:16:07,800
Will you look at this?

192
00:16:08,532 --> 00:16:09,966
Look.

193
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:11,467
Some of the best
minds in the country

194
00:16:11,469 --> 00:16:14,504
peeing all over the floor
in this here facility.

195
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:15,940
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

196
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:19,808
There's pee freckles
on the ceiling now.

197
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,513
How'd they get it up there?

198
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:26,050
Just how big a target
do they need, you figure?

199
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:30,189
They get enough practice,
that's for sure.

200
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,690
My Brewster...

201
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,892
no one's ever called him
a great mind,

202
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:40,297
but even he manages
to hit the can

203
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:41,534
70% of the time.

204
00:16:45,703 --> 00:16:46,970
Excuse us, sir.

205
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:49,072
No, no, no,
that's all right.

206
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:50,242
Go ahead.

207
00:16:52,109 --> 00:16:55,544
You ladies seem to be
chatting enjoyably.

208
00:16:55,546 --> 00:16:57,248
Girl talk, no doubt.

209
00:16:58,317 --> 00:16:59,852
Don't mind me.

210
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,360
Elisa.

211
00:17:12,129 --> 00:17:13,596
Look, don't touch.

212
00:17:13,598 --> 00:17:14,963
That lovely dingus
right there

213
00:17:14,965 --> 00:17:16,499
is an Alabama Howdy-do.

214
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:18,000
Molded grip handle...

215
00:17:18,002 --> 00:17:20,903
low current, high-voltage,
electric shock cattle prod.

216
00:17:20,905 --> 00:17:23,440
Name's Strickland, Security.

217
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:24,540
Fleming's security.

218
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,483
Oh, no.

219
00:17:34,485 --> 00:17:36,152
No, a man washes his hands

220
00:17:36,154 --> 00:17:39,221
before or after
tending to his needs.

221
00:17:39,223 --> 00:17:41,492
It tells you a lot
about a man.

222
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,028
He does it both times...

223
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,299
points to a weakness
in character.

224
00:17:50,734 --> 00:17:51,936
Ladies.

225
00:17:54,772 --> 00:17:57,475
It was very pleasant
chatting with you both.

226
00:18:18,963 --> 00:18:21,196
<i>Short people are mean.</i>

227
00:18:21,198 --> 00:18:22,633
I never met a short man

228
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:24,567
that stayed nice
all the way through.

229
00:18:24,569 --> 00:18:25,935
No, sir.

230
00:18:25,937 --> 00:18:28,306
Mean little backstabbers,
all of them.

231
00:18:29,107 --> 00:18:31,173
Maybe it's the air down there,

232
00:18:31,175 --> 00:18:32,977
not enough oxygen
or something.

233
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,704
Help! He's losing blood!

234
00:19:02,706 --> 00:19:03,772
Help!

235
00:19:03,774 --> 00:19:05,075
Come on, come on.

236
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,048
You think
the Russians broke in?

237
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,482
I don't think so.

238
00:19:13,484 --> 00:19:14,651
And if they did...

239
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,253
Duane's meatloaf
will kill them all, honey.

240
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:19,888
It was two shots.
Did you hear them?

241
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,224
All right, three.
And that scream.

242
00:19:22,226 --> 00:19:24,027
Lord, what ever happens
in this place?

243
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,098
You two, come with me.

244
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:28,265
Right now, Mr. Fleming, sir?

245
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,266
Any chance we get
to conclude our dinner?

246
00:19:30,268 --> 00:19:32,104
Now!

247
00:19:34,771 --> 00:19:36,239
Oh, heavens to Betsy.

248
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,673
We are in a pickle.

249
00:19:37,675 --> 00:19:39,710
We are in such a pickle.

250
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,386
You will have
exactly 20 minutes

251
00:19:51,388 --> 00:19:54,155
to render this... this lab
immaculate, and so on and so forth.

252
00:19:54,157 --> 00:19:56,194
20 minutes.

253
00:19:57,928 --> 00:20:00,365
It's a lot of blood.
What went on in here?

254
00:20:01,532 --> 00:20:03,135
I can handle pee.

255
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:05,969
I can handle poo.

256
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:08,070
But blood... Ugh.

257
00:20:08,072 --> 00:20:10,940
Blood just does
something to me.

258
00:20:10,942 --> 00:20:13,409
Here, hon. Help me mop it up.

259
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:15,614
The sooner we get outta here
the better.

260
00:20:29,527 --> 00:20:31,363
Is that a tater tot?

261
00:20:32,763 --> 00:20:34,032
Oh!

262
00:20:34,598 --> 00:20:36,201
It's a finger.

263
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,035
There's two fingers.

264
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:40,202
Okay, okay.

265
00:20:40,204 --> 00:20:42,105
Put them away.
And just wait here.

266
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:44,175
I'm gonna go get Mr. Fleming.

267
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,843
Where are these body parts?

268
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:21,113
The body parts?

269
00:21:27,284 --> 00:21:29,151
No, I believe you, honey.

270
00:21:29,153 --> 00:21:31,356
But are you sure it was alive?

271
00:21:32,389 --> 00:21:34,624
Because I saw a mermaid once
in a carnival tent...

272
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,859
and it was a monkey
sewn to the tail of a fish.

273
00:21:37,861 --> 00:21:38,863
Looked real to me.

274
00:21:39,896 --> 00:21:41,730
All right, I apologize.

275
00:21:41,732 --> 00:21:43,434
Oh! I have a deadline.

276
00:21:44,101 --> 00:21:45,667
Do you know,

277
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:48,639
corn flakes were invented
to prevent masturbation.

278
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:50,876
Didn't work.

279
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:55,345
Oh, Alice Faye just started.

280
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,381
She was a huge star, huge.

281
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:00,249
And one day, she couldn't
take the bullshit

282
00:22:00,251 --> 00:22:01,453
and the backstabbing anymore.

283
00:22:02,553 --> 00:22:04,721
She just walked away
from it all.

284
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:05,821
Ta-da!

285
00:22:05,823 --> 00:22:06,890
That's not bad, is it?

286
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,327
For being shit.

287
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:13,695
Listen. You eat,
you go to bed, you rest.

288
00:22:13,697 --> 00:22:16,732
And when I get paid...

289
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,340
we get pie!

290
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,973
No, we don't get pie.
I get pie.

291
00:22:24,975 --> 00:22:26,511
You get whatever you want.

292
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:28,779
Wish me luck.

293
00:22:57,608 --> 00:23:01,042
Green. They want the gelatin
to be green now.

294
00:23:01,044 --> 00:23:03,212
- I was told red.
- New concept.

295
00:23:03,214 --> 00:23:05,580
That's the future now.
Green.

296
00:23:05,582 --> 00:23:08,884
Oh, and they want them
happier, the family.

297
00:23:08,886 --> 00:23:10,787
- Happier? Happier?
- Mmm.

298
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:11,653
The father looks like

299
00:23:11,655 --> 00:23:12,954
he just discovered
the missionary position.

300
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:14,089
Giles.

301
00:23:14,091 --> 00:23:16,858
Well, what are they supposed
to be happy about?

302
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,695
The client wanted photographs,
I sold them on this.

303
00:23:19,697 --> 00:23:21,730
It's too bad.
This is nice work.

304
00:23:21,732 --> 00:23:24,636
It is nice, isn't it?
I think it's one of my best.

305
00:23:26,504 --> 00:23:28,903
How are you holding up?
You drinking?

306
00:23:28,905 --> 00:23:31,406
No, not a drop. No.

307
00:23:31,408 --> 00:23:34,676
Are you getting any work since
you left Klein and Saunders?

308
00:23:34,678 --> 00:23:37,180
You mean since I was asked
to leave by you.

309
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,882
We are not
getting into this now.

310
00:23:39,884 --> 00:23:41,486
I wanna come back, Bernie.

311
00:23:43,186 --> 00:23:46,257
We'll see.
Now, do this.

312
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:50,192
I think we're making
great progress.

313
00:23:50,194 --> 00:23:51,430
Good work.

314
00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:12,404
Elisa.

315
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:15,139
What are you doing in there?

316
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:18,844
Cleaning, huh?

317
00:26:19,877 --> 00:26:21,243
Listen, honey.

318
00:26:21,245 --> 00:26:24,012
Mr. "I pee with my hands
on my hips"

319
00:26:24,014 --> 00:26:25,582
wants to see us both.

320
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,383
<i>"Zelda D. Fuller."</i>

321
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:30,286
How long have you two
known each other, Zelda?

322
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:32,156
About 10 years, sir.

323
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,790
No siblings, Zelda?

324
00:26:35,792 --> 00:26:36,791
No, sir.

325
00:26:36,793 --> 00:26:39,463
That's not common, is it?
For your people?

326
00:26:40,397 --> 00:26:42,600
My mama died after me.

327
00:26:43,467 --> 00:26:45,002
After I was born.

328
00:26:47,571 --> 00:26:49,040
What does that "D" stand for?

329
00:26:50,474 --> 00:26:53,142
Delilah, sir.

330
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:54,477
On account of the Bible.

331
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:56,778
Delilah, she betrayed Samson.

332
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:00,583
Lulled him to sleep,
cut his hair.

333
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:03,551
Philistines tortured him,
humiliated him...

334
00:27:03,553 --> 00:27:05,489
burned his eyes out.

335
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,525
Guess my mama didn't read
the good book close enough.

336
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:10,729
And you...

337
00:27:12,196 --> 00:27:14,663
"Elisa Esposito."

338
00:27:14,665 --> 00:27:16,833
Doesn't "Esposito"
mean orphan?

339
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:19,567
"Our Lady of Sorrows
Orphanage in Putnam."

340
00:27:19,569 --> 00:27:21,938
They found her by the river

341
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,475
in the water.

342
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:27,479
It was you
that found my fingers.

343
00:27:29,313 --> 00:27:30,712
Oh!

344
00:27:30,714 --> 00:27:32,114
Thanks.

345
00:27:32,116 --> 00:27:33,715
Three hours in surgery.

346
00:27:33,717 --> 00:27:37,019
They rebuilt
the first phalanx here...

347
00:27:37,021 --> 00:27:38,421
sutured the tendons.

348
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:40,192
Don't know if
it's gonna take or not.

349
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:44,326
There was mustard on them.
A paper bag?

350
00:27:44,328 --> 00:27:45,961
It was all we had, sir.

351
00:27:45,963 --> 00:27:49,031
I answer mostly on account
that she can't talk.

352
00:27:49,033 --> 00:27:50,968
She can't? She deaf?

353
00:27:52,069 --> 00:27:53,538
Mute, sir.

354
00:27:54,204 --> 00:27:55,840
She said she can hear you.

355
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,712
All those scars on your neck.

356
00:28:03,714 --> 00:28:06,184
That's what did it.
Cut your voice box, right?

357
00:28:07,251 --> 00:28:09,352
She said since she was a baby.

358
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,686
Who would do that to a baby?

359
00:28:11,688 --> 00:28:13,888
The world is sinful.

360
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,691
Wouldn't you say so, Delilah?

361
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:17,662
Well, let me say this upfront.

362
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,730
You clean that lab,
you get out.

363
00:28:21,732 --> 00:28:24,733
The thing we keep in there
is an affront.

364
00:28:24,735 --> 00:28:27,336
Do you know what
an affront is, Zelda?

365
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:29,005
Something offensive.

366
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:30,739
That's right,
and I should know.

367
00:28:30,741 --> 00:28:34,576
I dragged that filthy thing...

368
00:28:34,578 --> 00:28:37,113
out of the river muck
in South America

369
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:38,617
all the way here.

370
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,615
And along the way,

371
00:28:40,617 --> 00:28:42,617
we didn't get
to like each other much.

372
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:46,221
Now...

373
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:50,662
you may think that thing
looks human.

374
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,595
Stands on two legs, right?

375
00:28:53,597 --> 00:28:56,734
But we're created
in the Lord's image.

376
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,135
You don't think that's what
the Lord looks like, do you?

377
00:29:00,137 --> 00:29:03,673
I wouldn't know, sir,
what the Lord looks like.

378
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:06,610
Well, it's human, Zelda.
He looks like a human, like me.

379
00:29:07,544 --> 00:29:09,711
Or even you.

380
00:29:09,713 --> 00:29:11,916
Maybe a little more like me,
I guess.

381
00:29:15,252 --> 00:29:16,620
That's all.

382
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:21,824
General Hoyt, thank you
for calling me back, sir.

383
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:24,093
<i>- Feeling better?</i>
- Oh, yes, sir, much better.

384
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,327
Pain pills is all.

385
00:29:25,329 --> 00:29:26,796
- Close the door.
<i>- You lost two fingers, was it?</i>

386
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,864
Two fingers, yeah.
He got two fingers.

387
00:29:28,866 --> 00:29:30,299
But I still got my thumb,

388
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:31,567
my trigger,
and my pussy finger.

389
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:33,402
<i>Sounds to me
like you'll do all right then.</i>

390
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:35,604
Yes, sir, that's right.

391
00:29:35,606 --> 00:29:37,605
Looking forward
to your visit, sir.

392
00:29:37,607 --> 00:29:40,209
Decisions need to be made
about the asset.

393
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,946
<i>Flavors
of fruity pies await you.</i>

394
00:30:18,948 --> 00:30:21,349
<i>Three new locations
in downtown Baltimore.</i>

395
00:30:21,351 --> 00:30:23,051
<i>The future is here.</i>

396
00:30:23,053 --> 00:30:24,252
Get some rest.

397
00:30:24,254 --> 00:30:25,386
<i>Pumpkin, banana...</i>

398
00:30:25,388 --> 00:30:27,355
Pick me up at 9:30.

399
00:30:27,357 --> 00:30:29,293
2130 hours. Yes, sir.

400
00:30:29,927 --> 00:30:33,194
<i>That's-a-great-a-pie.</i>

401
00:30:33,196 --> 00:30:34,329
I'm home.

402
00:30:35,698 --> 00:30:37,065
I made you an omelet.

403
00:30:37,067 --> 00:30:39,101
- Hey, Dad. Guess what?
- No pancakes?

404
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:40,803
I've been through half the boxes
and I can't find the griddles.

405
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:43,038
- Guess what?
- I made you a cheese and broccoli omelet.

406
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,105
How are you feeling?
Does it hurt?

407
00:30:44,107 --> 00:30:46,575
- A little bit. Pills help.
- Guess what?

408
00:30:46,577 --> 00:30:47,843
What?

409
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:50,613
We're burying a time capsule
at the new school.

410
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:52,181
I wanted to ask you...

411
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:55,550
Do you think we'll all have
jetpacks in the future?

412
00:30:55,552 --> 00:30:57,019
Believe it, son.

413
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,155
Oh! Bus is here.

414
00:30:59,723 --> 00:31:01,259
This is America.

415
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:03,995
Bye, Dad!

416
00:31:08,098 --> 00:31:09,030
Finish your omelet,

417
00:31:09,032 --> 00:31:10,465
then wash your hands
real good...

418
00:31:10,467 --> 00:31:12,134
and come upstairs, sweetie.

419
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:15,170
I kind of like it here.
The kids like the lawn.

420
00:31:15,172 --> 00:31:17,909
Plus DC is just half
an hour away, isn't it?

421
00:31:19,409 --> 00:31:22,913
It's still Baltimore, Elaine.
No one likes Baltimore.

422
00:31:25,715 --> 00:31:27,318
You know what I'm thinking?

423
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,089
I'm thinking I need a new car.

424
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:40,699
You need a new car, do you?

425
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:44,902
How about a Cadillac, mister?

426
00:31:45,368 --> 00:31:46,669
Richard.

427
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:50,705
Oh, Richard!

428
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,009
Sweetie, Sweetie?

429
00:31:55,011 --> 00:31:57,346
Sweetie, your, um,
your hand is bleeding.

430
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:58,580
Silence. Don't talk.

431
00:31:58,582 --> 00:32:00,449
Don't talk.
I want you in silence.

432
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:02,718
Silent, silent. Yes.

433
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:05,355
Silence.

434
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,532
<i>Dr. Levensen to Aeronautics.</i>

435

<i>Dr. Levensen to Aeronautics.</i>

436
00:35:24,488 --> 00:35:25,490
Hey!

437
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:30,526
- Gotcha.
- No, you didn't.

438
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:09,698
"The sparrow nests
on the window..."

439
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,899
What?

440
00:36:10,901 --> 00:36:15,770
"The sparrow nests
on the window sill!"

441
00:36:15,772 --> 00:36:17,939
"And the eagle
takes the prey."

442
00:36:17,941 --> 00:36:19,109
What?

443
00:38:24,367 --> 00:38:26,901
Elisa! Hurry, hurry, come on.

444
00:38:26,903 --> 00:38:28,338
I swear to God, girl.

445
00:38:29,939 --> 00:38:31,906
You're doing
it again, Zelda.

446
00:38:31,908 --> 00:38:33,477
Oh, give it a rest, Yolanda.

447
00:38:58,968 --> 00:39:00,035
Whoo!

448
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:01,636
Hey, Zelda, want a smoke?

449
00:39:01,638 --> 00:39:03,303
That shit ain't good
for you, Duane.

450
00:39:03,305 --> 00:39:04,774
Yeah, but it feel good.

451
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:08,142
It does, doesn't it?

452
00:39:08,144 --> 00:39:10,011
Come on, Elisa. Just one.

453
00:39:10,013 --> 00:39:11,546
Come on, come on, come on.

454
00:39:11,548 --> 00:39:14,584
Don't worry about that camera.
We push 'em up at break time.

455
00:39:15,685 --> 00:39:18,356
Mmm-hmm.
- This here is a blind spot.

456
00:39:19,289 --> 00:39:22,024
Man can't make meatloaf...

457
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,591
It adds a little spice.

460
00:39:46,316 --> 00:39:48,183
Fleming, I have to
finish some things in here.

461
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:50,285
Fetch the general, will you?

462
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:05,870
Aww, you missed me, huh?

463
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,807
I took a candy break.

464
00:40:14,144 --> 00:40:16,111
This is what scares you, huh?

465
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:17,793
Well, gee, you should
be used to it by now.

466
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:23,584
There you go again,
making that god-awful sound.

467
00:40:23,586 --> 00:40:26,589
Is that you crying, huh?
Is that what it is?

468
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:27,692
Are you hurting?

469
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:31,558
Or maybe you're angry!

470
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,798
Maybe you'd like to get
another bite of me.

I mean, are you begging?

474
00:40:43,673 --> 00:40:44,939
Because to me,

Everything's ready.
Glad to have you, sir.

00:41:44,334 --> 00:41:45,866
Ugly as sin.

486
00:41:45,868 --> 00:41:49,437
You know, the natives in the
Amazon worshiped it like a god.

487
00:41:49,439 --> 00:41:52,506
Doesn't look like
much of a god now, does it?

488
00:41:52,508 --> 00:41:53,975
Well, they're primitive, sir.

489
00:41:53,977 --> 00:41:55,977
You know, they would toss
offerings into the water.

490
00:41:55,979 --> 00:41:57,912
Flowers, fruits,
crap like that.

491
00:41:57,914 --> 00:41:59,881
Then they tried
to stop the oil drill

492
00:41:59,883 --> 00:42:01,183
with bows and arrows.

493
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,551
That didn't turn out too well.

494
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:04,488
He's bleeding.

495
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,821
What happened?

496
00:42:06,823 --> 00:42:08,823
It's an animal, Hoffstetler.
Just keeping it tame.

497
00:42:08,825 --> 00:42:12,493
"Oxygen osmosis
and dioxide exchange."

498
00:42:12,495 --> 00:42:14,062
What the hell
have we got here, son?

499
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:15,196
This creature, sir...

500
00:42:15,198 --> 00:42:16,631
it can alternate between two

501
00:42:16,633 --> 00:42:18,533
entirely separate
breathing mechanisms.

502
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:20,868
- A mudskipper can do that.
- No.

503
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:22,470
Look.

504
00:42:22,472 --> 00:42:24,339
You want to put
a man in space.

505
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:25,908
He's gonna have
to endure conditions

506
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,343
the human body
just wasn't made for.

507
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:31,180
This gives us an edge
against the Soviets.

508
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:33,214
How long can it breathe
outside the water?

509
00:42:33,216 --> 00:42:34,383
The reality is, sir,

510
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,087
we don't know jack shit
about this thing.

511
00:42:38,488 --> 00:42:41,355
Well, the Soviets want it.
We know that much.

512
00:42:41,357 --> 00:42:42,957
Those cockeyed bastards.

513
00:42:42,959 --> 00:42:45,894
You know, we let 'em send
a dog up into space,

514
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:46,962
and we get a good laugh.

515
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:49,263
Then the next thing you know,
they send a human up,

516
00:42:49,265 --> 00:42:50,399
a Russki,

517
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,834
orbiting the planet,
doing God knows what.

518
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:55,870
Who's laughing then?
Khrushchev, that's who.

519
00:42:55,872 --> 00:42:58,740
Let him send a dog up into
space, and he laughs.

520
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,209
Then he puts a commie
up in space, and he laughs.

521
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:03,580
And then he puts
missiles into Cuba.

522
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:05,546
Have we learned nothing?

523
00:43:05,548 --> 00:43:07,482
Sir, we need to
get him back in the water.

524
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:09,651
See, these scientists,
they're like artists, sir.

525
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:11,319
They fall in love
with their plaything.

526
00:43:11,321 --> 00:43:12,854
Now, right here, see?

527
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:14,089
Along the middle.

528
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:16,491
This creature has
a thick-jointed cartilage

529
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:19,127
that separates the primary
and secondary lungs.

530
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:20,328
Am I explaining
this correctly, Bob?

531
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:21,428
Yes, but we have...

532
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:24,232
It makes the X-rays
inconclusive.

533
00:43:24,234 --> 00:43:25,566
In principle, sir, yes. But...

534
00:43:25,568 --> 00:43:27,502
Now, I believe if we want to
get an edge on the Soviets

535
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:29,571
we need to vivisect
this thing.

536
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:30,537
- No, no.
- Take it apart,

537
00:43:30,539 --> 00:43:31,640
- learn how it works.
- No.

538
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:33,644
No! That would
defeat the purpose.

539
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:36,847
Sir, he's passed out.
Please.

540
00:43:37,513 --> 00:43:38,913
Put him in the tank.

541
00:43:38,915 --> 00:43:40,084
Let him pressurize.

542
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:42,419
General Hoyt, sir?

543
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:46,421
You cannot,
under any circumstance,

544
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:47,625
kill this creature.

545
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:54,662
Count these stars
with me, son.

546
00:43:54,664 --> 00:43:56,064
There are five of them.

547
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:58,399
Means I can do
whatever the hell I want.

548
00:43:58,401 --> 00:43:59,667
Now, you want
to plead your case,

549
00:43:59,669 --> 00:44:00,935
I'll listen to it.

550
00:44:00,937 --> 00:44:04,573
But at the end of the day,
it is my damn decision.

551
00:44:49,852 --> 00:44:52,687
So crack the damn thing open,
learn what you can,

552
00:44:52,689 --> 00:44:54,723
and close up shop here.

553
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:57,125
Give yourself a good
pat on the back, Strickland.

554
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:58,259
You've done it.

555
00:44:58,261 --> 00:44:59,394
Thank you, sir.

556
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:01,529
Now, hurry up
and finish the job, son.

557
00:45:01,531 --> 00:45:03,133
Absolutely, sir.

558
00:45:04,767 --> 00:45:06,234
<i>Get him out?</i>

559
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:08,169
What are you talking about?

560
00:45:08,171 --> 00:45:10,173
No. Absolutely not.

561
00:45:11,242 --> 00:45:13,341
Because it's breaking the law,
that's why.

562
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,613
We're probably breaking
the law just talking about it.

563
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:19,249
Oh, he's alone? Oh.

564
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:21,549
Does this mean that whenever

565
00:45:21,551 --> 00:45:22,850
we go to
a Chinese restaurant

566
00:45:22,852 --> 00:45:25,953
you wanna save
every fish in the tank?

567
00:45:25,955 --> 00:45:28,925
So what if he's alone?
We're all alone.

568
00:45:31,394 --> 00:45:32,660
The loneliest thing
you've ever seen?

569
00:45:32,662 --> 00:45:34,562
Well, you just said it right there.
You just said it!

570
00:45:34,564 --> 00:45:36,566
You called it a thing.
It's a thing. It's a freak.

571
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:39,537
I can understand you.

572
00:45:43,272 --> 00:45:45,209
Calm down. God, calm down.

573
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:47,811
All right,
I will repeat it to you.

574
00:45:53,482 --> 00:45:54,919
"What am I?

575
00:45:59,622 --> 00:46:02,659
"I move my mouth, like him.

576
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:07,062
"I make no sound, like him.

577
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:11,335
"What does that make me?

578
00:46:13,769 --> 00:46:15,836
"All that I am...

579
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:18,305
"all that I've ever been...

580
00:46:18,307 --> 00:46:21,042
"brought me here, to him."

581
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:24,080
See, you're saying "him."
It's a "him" now.

582
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:27,115
You just hit me!

583
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,582
Elisa, let go of me.

584
00:46:28,584 --> 00:46:29,817
I'm looking. I'm looking!

585
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:32,020
You've never hit me.

586
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:40,864
"When he looks at me,
the way he looks at me...

587
00:46:41,731 --> 00:46:45,768
"He does not know
what I lack...

588
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:48,739
"or how...

589
00:46:50,106 --> 00:46:51,642
"I am incomplete.

590
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:56,144
"He sees me...

591
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,680
"for what I am...

592
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:00,184
"as I am.

593
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,922
"He's happy...

594
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:08,859
"to see me, every time...

595
00:47:09,591 --> 00:47:10,994
"every day.

596
00:47:12,461 --> 00:47:15,898
"And now I can either...

597
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,102
"save him...

598
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,875
or let him die."

599
00:47:26,709 --> 00:47:29,711
Oh, God. I'm leaving.

600
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:32,680
Elisa, no. I have to leave.

601
00:47:32,682 --> 00:47:34,082
Just... Elisa, please stop.

602
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:35,716
Listen to me.
Just listen to me.

603
00:47:35,718 --> 00:47:37,584
I have to go.

604
00:47:37,586 --> 00:47:39,754
I'm leaving now
because, Elisa,

605
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:40,888
this is very important to me.

606
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:42,490
This is a second
chance for me.

607
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:44,658
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

608
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,227
Oh, God.

609
00:47:46,229 --> 00:47:47,495
When I come back,
we just will not talk

610
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:49,129
about this ever again.

611
00:47:49,131 --> 00:47:50,665
Elisa, there's...

612
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:51,732
All right!

613
00:47:53,035 --> 00:47:55,169
What are we?
What are you and I?

614
00:47:55,171 --> 00:47:57,238
Do you know what we are?
We're nothing!

615
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,073
Nothing! We can do nothing!

616
00:47:59,075 --> 00:48:02,910
I'm sorry, but this...
this is just...

617
00:48:02,912 --> 00:48:05,081
Oh, God, it's not
even human. God!

618
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,355
What?

619
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:29,206
Giles.

620
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:36,278
- I've been waiting.
- I know. Sorry.

621
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,281
It's okay.

622
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:39,717
We going in?

623
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,383
You should have
just mailed the art.

624
00:48:42,385 --> 00:48:43,350
No.

625
00:48:43,352 --> 00:48:46,220
I want to show it to you
and the team in person.

626
00:48:46,222 --> 00:48:48,189
I think it's some
of my best work.

627
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:50,959
And it's green as can be.

628
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:54,997
It's, uh, it's not a good time.
Maybe later.

629
00:48:57,466 --> 00:48:59,232
Oh. Well, sure.

630
00:48:59,234 --> 00:49:00,403
No problem.

631
00:49:02,338 --> 00:49:05,242
What would be a good time
for you, Bernie?

632
00:49:12,948 --> 00:49:14,950
You painted that?

633
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,250
Yeah.

634
00:49:16,252 --> 00:49:18,051
Wowee!

635
00:49:18,053 --> 00:49:19,319
You're good.

636
00:49:19,321 --> 00:49:21,788
Apparently, not as good
as a photograph.

637
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:25,359
But it is good, isn't it?

638
00:49:25,361 --> 00:49:27,361
I couldn't paint
anything like that.

639
00:49:27,363 --> 00:49:29,696
Here. On me.

640
00:49:29,698 --> 00:49:30,865
For me?

641
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:32,366
Well, we don't get
many like you in here.

642
00:49:32,368 --> 00:49:35,506
You seem very educated,
and I like talking to you.

643
00:49:36,573 --> 00:49:39,908
The thing is that's...

644
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,377
the only reason
that I come in here is...

645
00:49:42,379 --> 00:49:44,245
- The conversation.
- And?

646
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:46,346
The pie is mighty fine,
too, isn't it?

647
00:49:46,348 --> 00:49:47,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

648
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:50,921
It's no key lime,
but it's good.

649
00:49:54,656 --> 00:49:56,957
You know, I work alone...

650
00:49:56,959 --> 00:50:01,395
and my best friend's not much
of a conversationalist.

651
00:50:01,397 --> 00:50:03,096
You see, that's part
of doing the job here.

652
00:50:03,098 --> 00:50:05,198
It's like being a bartender.

653
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,301
You serve people pie.
You listen to their problems.

654
00:50:07,303 --> 00:50:08,872
You get to know them.

655
00:50:11,073 --> 00:50:13,341
I'd like to get
to know you better.

656
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:14,908
What the hell
are you doing, old man?

657
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:17,178
- Let's sit down.
- Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

658
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,044
Hey, no, no, no.

659
00:50:18,046 --> 00:50:19,580
Not the counter.
Takeout only.

660
00:50:19,582 --> 00:50:20,848
You can't sit there.

661
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:22,450
If you want something,
you order, you take it out.

662
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:24,886
But it's empty.
The... the counter's empty.

663
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:27,491
All reserved, all day.
You don't sit down.

664
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:32,863
Y'all come back now, you hear?

665
00:50:33,863 --> 00:50:35,463
You don't need
to talk to them like that.

666
00:50:36,832 --> 00:50:39,066
You should go, too.

667
00:50:39,068 --> 00:50:42,004
And don't come back.
This is a family restaurant.

668
00:51:01,357 --> 00:51:03,524
I have no one.

669
00:51:03,526 --> 00:51:06,062
And you are the only person
that I can talk to.

670
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:10,133
Now, whatever this thing is...

671
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:12,368
you need it.

672
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,502
So...

673
00:51:15,504 --> 00:51:17,538
you just tell me
what to do.

674
00:51:36,024 --> 00:51:39,194
- "All hope fades."
- "As the spring recedes."

675
00:51:39,196 --> 00:51:40,230
Let's go.

676
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:40,180
Cadillac DeVille.
Best car ever made.

677
00:53:40,182 --> 00:53:44,218
V8, 390 CID, clean and crisp
like a fresh dollar bill.

678
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,852
I'm just idling around.

679
00:53:45,854 --> 00:53:47,287
And I'm just talking.

680
00:53:47,289 --> 00:53:49,089
AM radio, air conditioner,

681
00:53:49,091 --> 00:53:53,060
power windows, power brakes,
power steering, power seats.

682
00:53:53,062 --> 00:53:55,062
All deluxe interior
appointment choices,

683
00:53:55,064 --> 00:53:56,596
143 options.

684
00:53:56,598 --> 00:53:58,332
Now, this...

685
00:53:58,334 --> 00:54:01,134
- is the Taj Mahal on wheels.
- Hmm.

686
00:54:01,136 --> 00:54:02,736
I'm not sure about the green.

687
00:54:02,738 --> 00:54:04,138
It's not green,
my friend. Teal.

688
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:06,272
- Well, teal looks green to me.
- But it isn't, see?

689
00:54:06,274 --> 00:54:08,475
It's a limited edition,
12 coats of paint...

690
00:54:08,477 --> 00:54:09,776
polished by hand,

691
00:54:09,778 --> 00:54:11,879
all authentic
chrome detailing.

692
00:54:11,881 --> 00:54:13,781
Four out of five
successful men in America

693
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:14,948
drive a Cadillac.

694
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:16,082
That a fact?

695
00:54:16,084 --> 00:54:17,283
This here is the future.

696
00:54:17,285 --> 00:54:19,720
And you strike me as a man
who is headed there.

697
00:54:19,722 --> 00:54:21,421
- Where?
- Why, the future.

698
00:54:21,423 --> 00:54:24,627
You're the man of the future.
You belong in this car.

699
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:20,480
Wow!

700
00:55:20,482 --> 00:55:22,885
Sir, that is a...
that is a beautiful car!

701
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,419
What can I say?

702
00:55:25,421 --> 00:55:27,223
You gotta feel good
driving that, huh?

703
00:55:28,356 --> 00:55:30,790
And what a wonderful
shade of green, huh?

704
00:55:30,792 --> 00:55:32,359
Teal.

705
00:55:32,361 --> 00:55:33,530
Teal.

706
00:55:42,171 --> 00:55:44,571
Tomorrow, I'll make
a mean meatloaf.

707
00:55:44,573 --> 00:55:45,573
Mmm-hmm.

708
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:48,245
Just for you, extra raisins.

709
00:56:13,502 --> 00:56:15,336
So, at 5:00 AM,
I drive my car

710
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:16,571
down the loading ramp.

711
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:18,906
And the shifts are changing,
and I have...

712
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:20,875
How much time do I have?

713
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,475
Five minutes? I'll remember.

714
00:56:22,477 --> 00:56:24,912
5:00 AM, five minutes.
Five-five, five-five.

715
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:27,415
So, you're going
to move the cameras, right?

716
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:29,482
And I'm gonna be
synchronizing our watches

717
00:56:29,484 --> 00:56:31,384
just like they do
in the movies.

718
00:56:31,386 --> 00:56:34,055
Oh, God! I'm so proud of you.

719
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:36,392
God! You're not afraid!

720
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:40,261
You are? Very?

721
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:43,064
Don't tell me that.
I'm terrified.

722
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:49,770
I think this is some
of my best work.

723
00:56:49,772 --> 00:56:52,138
"Michael Parker." I think
it's a good, trustworthy name.

724
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:53,274
It's a little butch.

725
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:55,345
Yes, age 51.

726
00:56:56,578 --> 00:56:57,580
54?

727
00:57:00,115 --> 00:57:01,318
You don't have to be rude.

728
00:57:02,651 --> 00:57:03,986
57.

729
00:57:05,055 --> 00:57:06,120
If I put the hair on,

730
00:57:06,122 --> 00:57:07,721
I can pull it off.
I can wear this...

731
00:57:07,723 --> 00:57:08,689
or I have...

732
00:57:08,691 --> 00:57:11,392
Thor, go. Off, off, off! Go!

733
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:12,526
Or I have this.

734
00:57:12,528 --> 00:57:14,828
Now this, I think it says
"working man."

735
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:17,399
But this, now this says...

736
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:20,401
this says with
the butterscotch tie...

737
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:24,104
This says "casual,
but still stylish."

738
00:57:24,106 --> 00:57:27,107
So, you like this?
I agree, I agree.

739
00:57:27,109 --> 00:57:28,542
I think we're ready.

740
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:51,165
Mr. Strickland!

741
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:52,899
Sally, could you call
Miss Esposito

742
00:57:52,901 --> 00:57:54,637
to clean up a spill?

743
00:57:58,107 --> 00:58:01,207
You know,
I can't figure it out myself.

744
00:58:01,209 --> 00:58:02,778
You're not much to look at...

745
00:58:03,946 --> 00:58:05,279
but go figure.

746
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:07,348
I keep thinking about you.

747
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:10,350
When you say you're mute,
are you entirely silent...

748
00:58:10,352 --> 00:58:12,421
or do you squawk a little?

749
00:58:13,589 --> 00:58:16,156
Some mutes squawk.
Not pretty, but...

750
00:58:16,158 --> 00:58:17,493
Hmm?

751
00:58:20,062 --> 00:58:22,065
I just want you to know...

752
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:25,765
I don't mind those scars.

753
00:58:25,767 --> 00:58:28,602
I don't mind that
you can't speak, either.

754
00:58:28,604 --> 00:58:31,040
When you come
right down to it...

755
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,510
I like it.

756
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:35,844
A lot.

757
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:38,781
It kind of gets me going.

758
00:58:46,455 --> 00:58:47,957
I bet I can make you
squawk a little.

759
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:23,059
Hey, honey. You okay?

760
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:26,259
Hurry up.
I wanna be home early.

761
00:59:26,261 --> 00:59:27,796
My feet are killing me.

762
00:59:54,555 --> 00:59:56,525
We need to delay
the procedure.

763
00:59:57,325 --> 00:59:59,192
Knock before
you enter my office.

764
00:59:59,194 --> 01:00:00,463
This is urgent!

765
01:00:01,231 --> 01:00:02,796
Go back out, knock,

766
01:00:02,798 --> 01:00:03,997
then I'll let you in
and we'll talk.

767
01:00:03,999 --> 01:00:06,668
That's the protocol.
Follow the protocol.

768
01:00:12,975 --> 01:00:13,975
Come in.

769
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:15,812
Would you get the door
for me, please?

770
01:00:21,517 --> 01:00:23,917
See? That's the way.
Now, we talk.

771
01:00:23,919 --> 01:00:25,451
I need more time.

772
01:00:25,453 --> 01:00:27,455
Don't let the fact
that you feel like a loser

773
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,723
now that you've let your
competitive tendencies...

774
01:00:29,725 --> 01:00:32,359
I'm not competitive!
I don't want an intricate,

775
01:00:32,361 --> 01:00:33,796
beautiful thing destroyed!

776
01:00:38,133 --> 01:00:39,767
This thing dies...

777
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:42,537
you learn, I leave,
out of here.

778
01:00:42,539 --> 01:00:44,504
I settle down.

779
01:00:44,506 --> 01:00:47,308
My family settles down
somewhere nice.

780
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:48,978
<i>A real city.</i>

781
01:00:54,751 --> 01:00:57,584
This creature
is intelligent...

782
01:00:57,586 --> 01:00:59,519
capable of language...

783
01:00:59,521 --> 01:01:01,957
of understanding emotions.

784
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,890
So are the Soviets, the Gooks.

785
01:01:04,892 --> 01:01:07,828
And we still kill them,
don't we?

786
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,529
The bottom line is,
this isn't a petting zoo

787
01:01:10,531 --> 01:01:12,966
and I don't wanna be
in this shit hole

788
01:01:12,968 --> 01:01:14,500
any longer than need be.

789
01:01:14,502 --> 01:01:16,004
Do you?

790
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:20,043
Bob. Do you?

791
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:23,479
No, I don't.

792
01:01:44,566 --> 01:01:46,569
Hey, what are you waiting for?

793
01:01:47,303 --> 01:01:49,169
Have you seen Elisa?

794
01:01:49,171 --> 01:01:50,839
Come on, Zelda!

795
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,653
Did you move
the camera on the loading dock?

796
01:02:06,655 --> 01:02:08,288
Is that where
you're taking him?

797
01:02:08,290 --> 01:02:09,756
Through the service tunnels?

798
01:02:09,758 --> 01:02:11,660
That's very smart.

799
01:02:12,294 --> 01:02:14,227
Who do you work for?

800
01:02:32,948 --> 01:02:36,450
His water must be kept
at 5 to 8% salinity.

801
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:38,019
Table salt will do.

802
01:02:38,021 --> 01:02:41,990
Mix one of these in his water
every three days.

803
01:02:42,892 --> 01:02:46,026
Raw protein diet is a must.

804
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:47,694
In five minutes...

805
01:02:47,696 --> 01:02:49,229
<i>I'll meet you
at the loading dock.</i>

806
01:02:49,231 --> 01:02:50,663
<i>The lights will go out...</i>

807
01:02:50,665 --> 01:02:52,234
<i>so be prepared.</i>

808
01:03:11,752 --> 01:03:13,520
Mr. Strickland, sir?

809
01:03:13,522 --> 01:03:15,888
Twelve hours to
the vivisection of the asset.

810
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:18,293
And I need your signature
here, please.

811
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:24,497
<i>...this
sudden, clandestine decision</i>

812
01:03:24,499 --> 01:03:26,000
<i>to station strategic weapons</i>

813
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:28,671
<i>for the first time
outside of Soviet soil...</i>

814
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:31,872
Hold it right there.

815
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:34,209
<i>...an unjustified change
in the status quo...</i>

816
01:03:52,693 --> 01:03:54,794
"Michael Parker." Is that you?

817
01:03:54,796 --> 01:03:56,265
My whole life.

818
01:04:13,548 --> 01:04:15,050
Are you out of your mind?

819
01:04:17,185 --> 01:04:20,722
Don't do this, Elisa.
Don't do this!

820
01:04:25,894 --> 01:04:28,194
What's that?
What's that vehicle?

821
01:04:28,196 --> 01:04:32,064
Gosh, sir, I'm not sure.
It's a laundry van?

822
01:04:32,066 --> 01:04:34,102
But it's not scheduled.

823
01:04:38,807 --> 01:04:40,240
<i>And finally,</i>

824
01:04:40,242 --> 01:04:42,308
<i>I call upon
Chairman Khrushchev</i>

825
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:43,946
<i>to halt and eliminate...</i>

826
01:04:44,845 --> 01:04:46,779
<i>this clandestine, reckless,</i>

827
01:04:46,781 --> 01:04:49,015
<i>and provocative threat
to world peace</i>

828
01:04:49,017 --> 01:04:51,854
<i>and to stable relations
between our two nations.</i>

829
01:04:57,959 --> 01:04:58,792
Sir?

830
01:04:58,794 --> 01:05:01,595
- Meet me at the loading dock.
- Sir!

831
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:03,437
- Sir, what do you need me to do?
- Get backup.

832
01:05:06,935 --> 01:05:08,401
Step out of the vehicle, sir.

833
01:05:08,403 --> 01:05:09,970
Oh, God. I'm not good at this.

834
01:05:09,972 --> 01:05:12,105
Out of the vehicle now.
I will not say it again.

835
01:05:12,107 --> 01:05:13,973
- Oh, God. Please don't shoot me!
- Get out!

836
01:05:13,975 --> 01:05:15,215
Oh, God.
Don't shoot me. Please.

837
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:27,423
What are you waiting for?
We're out of time!

838
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:30,126
Get out now!

839
01:05:32,227 --> 01:05:33,961
You have to go. Hurry!

840
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:36,462
Oh, woman,
we're gonna burn in hell.

841
01:05:36,464 --> 01:05:37,698
Come on, push.

842
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,102
Push!

843
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:43,102
I swear, I'm not
doing this on purpose!

844
01:05:43,104 --> 01:05:45,307
Mechanical objects and I
just don't get along!

845
01:05:49,343 --> 01:05:50,343
What the...

846
01:05:50,345 --> 01:05:52,712
She's waiting for you
at the dock. Go! Now!

847
01:06:08,296 --> 01:06:10,136
Who's that man? I think
he just killed someone.

848
01:06:12,434 --> 01:06:14,403
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

849
01:06:29,484 --> 01:06:31,287
Are we ready,
are we ready?

850
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:39,461
He's so beautiful.

851
01:06:48,171 --> 01:06:49,172
Did I do that?

852
01:06:51,874 --> 01:06:53,209
I'm just not good at this.

853
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:55,843
Move! Move!

854
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,189
Come on. No.

855
01:07:44,526 --> 01:07:45,994
No!

856
01:08:06,981 --> 01:08:09,384
Salt? What are you
talking about, salt?

857
01:08:11,787 --> 01:08:13,055
Elisa!

858
01:09:03,638 --> 01:09:04,640
There.

859
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:23,559
Israeli Popper.

860
01:09:25,727 --> 01:09:27,663
You can smell the magnesium.

861
01:09:29,096 --> 01:09:30,429
Russians hate the Jews,

862
01:09:30,431 --> 01:09:33,001
but they can't get enough
of their gadgets.

863
01:09:34,736 --> 01:09:36,102
How'd they get in here?

864
01:09:36,104 --> 01:09:39,038
Forged ID, painted plates,
and so on and so forth.

865
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:42,709
And they moved the main
video camera on the dock, sir.

866
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:43,876
Well, no one has to know.

867
01:09:43,878 --> 01:09:45,612
We got 24 hours
before I bounce it up.

868
01:09:45,614 --> 01:09:47,546
No, I called it in.

869
01:09:47,548 --> 01:09:48,682
You called it in?

870
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:50,218
The moment it happened, I...

871
01:09:50,918 --> 01:09:52,454
Mr. Strickland, sir.

872
01:09:53,989 --> 01:09:55,255
What is it, Sally?

873
01:09:55,257 --> 01:09:57,925
Sir, General Hoyt
is on the phone.

874
01:09:57,927 --> 01:10:00,693
<i>That thing was
our space dog, Strickland.</i>

875
01:10:00,695 --> 01:10:01,827
<i>You know that.</i>

876
01:10:01,829 --> 01:10:03,662
Sir, I'm getting it back.

877
01:10:03,664 --> 01:10:07,599
I don't. I can't be in a negative
frame of mind, sir.

878
01:10:07,601 --> 01:10:08,969
<i>So, are you feeling good?</i>

879
01:10:08,971 --> 01:10:11,170
Feeling strong.
Getting it back.

880
01:10:11,172 --> 01:10:14,107
<i>You can get it done.
You're gonna get it done.</i>

881
01:10:14,109 --> 01:10:16,579
<i>For me, son. For me.</i>

882
01:10:57,819 --> 01:11:00,519
That's when you're
planning on releasing him?

883
01:11:00,521 --> 01:11:02,123
On the 10th?

884
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:05,224
So, what if the rains
are late?

885
01:11:05,226 --> 01:11:06,694
What happens with the canal?

886
01:11:08,463 --> 01:11:09,531
All right.

887
01:11:13,601 --> 01:11:15,070
What's that?

888
01:11:16,104 --> 01:11:18,641
Let me see it.
Is that for me?

889
01:11:57,413 --> 01:12:01,217
Yeah, that's good.
Keep that up.

890
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:05,218
Looking like
you don't know anything.

891
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:08,854
Lord help me,
if they ask me if I do.

892
01:12:08,856 --> 01:12:10,223
I'm not a good liar.

893
01:12:10,225 --> 01:12:11,524
Except to Brewster.

894
01:12:11,526 --> 01:12:14,193
It takes a lot of lies
to keep a marriage going.

895
01:12:14,195 --> 01:12:15,594
<i>All personnel,</i>

896
01:12:15,596 --> 01:12:18,163
<i>prepare to present your
identity and clearance cards.</i>

897
01:12:18,165 --> 01:12:21,768
Lord! What in the...

898
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:23,635
<i>Attention. All personnel,</i>

899
01:12:23,637 --> 01:12:27,006
<i>prepare to present your
identity and clearance cards.</i>

900
01:12:27,008 --> 01:12:29,142
You done got us
in a world of trouble.

901
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:30,376
My opinion,
we're looking

902
01:12:30,378 --> 01:12:32,045
at a highly-trained
group, sir.

903
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:33,813
I'm thinking,
conceivably, sir,

904
01:12:33,815 --> 01:12:36,349
like special forces
or so on and so forth.

905
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:38,084
Red Army Special Forces?

906
01:12:38,086 --> 01:12:39,285
Conceivably.

907
01:12:39,287 --> 01:12:40,719
And they're highly trained.

908
01:12:40,721 --> 01:12:43,557
They were well-financed,
an elite group.

909
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:46,526
Highly efficient, ruthless,
clockwork precision.

910
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:48,460
Infiltration took less
than five minutes, sir.

911
01:12:48,462 --> 01:12:50,330
My conservative estimate
is that this was

912
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:52,200
a strike force
of at least 10 men.

913
01:13:04,913 --> 01:13:06,781
<i>My master sends this dress.</i>

914
01:13:07,749 --> 01:13:09,551
Have you always been alone?

915
01:13:14,189 --> 01:13:15,824
Did you ever have someone?

916
01:13:17,391 --> 01:13:19,559
Do you know what
happened to you? Do you?

917
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:21,730
Because I don't. I don't know
what happened to me.

918
01:13:23,164 --> 01:13:24,496
I don't know.

919
01:13:24,498 --> 01:13:26,933
I look in the mirror and the
only thing that I recognize

920
01:13:26,935 --> 01:13:28,504
are these eyes...

921
01:13:29,337 --> 01:13:31,573
in this old man's face.

922
01:13:36,677 --> 01:13:38,911
You know, sometimes I think
I was either born too early

923
01:13:38,913 --> 01:13:40,281
or too late for my life.

924
01:13:43,351 --> 01:13:46,752
Maybe we're both just relics.

925
01:13:46,754 --> 01:13:48,788
<i>Security
measures have been increased</i>

926
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:49,988
<i>to maximum levels.</i>

927
01:13:49,990 --> 01:13:53,628
<i>Prepare to present your
identity and clearance cards.</i>

928
01:13:57,065 --> 01:13:58,497
<i>Attention.</i>

929
01:13:58,499 --> 01:14:01,300
<i>Security measures have been
increased to maximum levels.</i>

930
01:14:01,302 --> 01:14:03,435
Sir, I've got them.

931
01:14:03,437 --> 01:14:05,940
Zelda, Elisa. All right.

932
01:14:08,776 --> 01:14:09,912
Here we go.

933
01:14:11,879 --> 01:14:12,911
Mmm-hmm.

934
01:14:12,913 --> 01:14:15,747
Looks like you two punched out
before the incident.

935
01:14:15,749 --> 01:14:17,517
Still.

936
01:14:17,519 --> 01:14:20,051
If you know something
about what transpired here

937
01:14:20,053 --> 01:14:22,788
it's your obligation...

938
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:24,390
to report any detail,

939
01:14:24,392 --> 01:14:27,426
no matter how small
or trivial it may seem.

940
01:14:27,428 --> 01:14:29,629
"Trivial" means unimportant.

941
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:33,666
I didn't see nothing
out of the ordinary, no.

942
01:14:33,668 --> 01:14:35,100
Or trivial.

943
01:14:35,102 --> 01:14:36,870
See, my feet were hurting.

944
01:14:36,872 --> 01:14:38,039
What about you?

945
01:14:40,141 --> 01:14:42,043
She didn't see anything.

946
01:14:43,878 --> 01:14:44,979
Mmm.

947
01:14:51,819 --> 01:14:53,886
Hoffstetler, Dr. Hoffstetler.

948
01:14:53,888 --> 01:14:56,656
Did either of you see him
coming in or out of the lab?

949
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:58,625
He works there, doesn't he?

950
01:14:58,627 --> 01:15:02,964
I mean in a different way,
doing something different.

951
01:15:04,364 --> 01:15:06,501
Something trivial?

952
01:15:07,068 --> 01:15:08,404
No, sir.

953
01:15:22,249 --> 01:15:26,754
What am I doing,
interviewing the fucking help?

954
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:29,825
The shit cleaners.

955
01:15:30,825 --> 01:15:32,694
The piss wipers.

956
01:15:36,029 --> 01:15:38,399
You two, go ahead. Leave.

957
01:15:43,404 --> 01:15:46,874
All right, you're clear.
So, back to work. Go on.

958
01:15:48,642 --> 01:15:50,078
What'd you say to me?

959
01:15:54,917 --> 01:15:56,352
What is she saying?

960
01:15:58,119 --> 01:15:59,421
I didn't catch it.

961
01:16:00,254 --> 01:16:01,586
What is she saying?

962
01:16:01,588 --> 01:16:04,092
She... she is saying thank you.

963
01:16:14,269 --> 01:16:15,637
Next!

964
01:16:33,087 --> 01:16:37,590
<i>I didn't see you
last night or the night before.</i>

965
01:16:37,592 --> 01:16:39,024
<i>I'm sorry, Ed,</i>

966
01:16:39,026 --> 01:16:40,693
<i>but now that I'm spending
all day long in the office,</i>

967
01:16:40,695 --> 01:16:43,196
<i>Carol feels that I... I should
spend my evenings with her.</i>

968
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:46,032
<i>Well, if you
spend the evenings with her,</i>

969
01:16:46,034 --> 01:16:47,267
<i>when will I?</i>

970
01:16:54,775 --> 01:16:57,845
<i>There's only
one thing left to do.</i>

971
01:16:58,846 --> 01:17:00,045
<i>Volunteer.</i>

972
01:17:29,010 --> 01:17:30,712
No! No, no, no, no, no!

973
01:17:54,601 --> 01:17:56,969
I wanna get home early.

974
01:17:56,971 --> 01:18:00,075
Brewster's been in
a bad mood lately.

975
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:04,010
Holy Jesus!

976
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:05,678
What are you doin'
standing in the shadows

977
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:07,013
of the women's locker room?

978
01:18:07,015 --> 01:18:08,948
They may be watching me,
and there are no cameras here.

979
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:09,983
For good reason.

980
01:18:09,985 --> 01:18:11,850
But have you caught us
at an inconvenient moment!

981
01:18:11,852 --> 01:18:13,685
I need to know
that he's alright.

982
01:18:13,687 --> 01:18:15,755
- He is.
- When will you release him?

983
01:18:15,757 --> 01:18:16,956
Soon.

984
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:20,062
When the rain fills the canal
that flows to the sea.

985
01:18:23,196 --> 01:18:25,063
If you need anything...

986
01:18:25,065 --> 01:18:26,635
Release him. Soon.

987
01:18:30,137 --> 01:18:31,836
What did she say?

988
01:18:31,838 --> 01:18:34,510
She said you're a good man,
Dr. Hoffstetler.

989
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:39,213
My name is Dimitri.

990
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:44,019
Honored to meet you.

991
01:18:45,954 --> 01:18:48,121
Hey, dummy!
Phone call for you.

992
01:18:48,123 --> 01:18:49,988
It's urgent.

993
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:57,098
Don't worry about me.
I'm fine.

994
01:18:58,098 --> 01:18:59,101
Believe me. I'm fine.

995
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:01,533
He ate Pandora.

996
01:19:01,535 --> 01:19:03,935
Wasn't his fault.
He's a wild creature.

997
01:19:03,937 --> 01:19:06,237
We can't ask him
to be anything else.

998
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:08,040
Elisa, go find him.

999
01:19:08,042 --> 01:19:10,041
Go. Go.

1000
01:19:10,043 --> 01:19:11,376
Go!

1001
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:14,080
You're lucky.

1002
01:20:16,444 --> 01:20:17,980
Ow.

1003
01:20:19,379 --> 01:20:21,781
I stayed awake
as long as I could.

1004
01:20:21,783 --> 01:20:23,752
You know,
I'm not even mad anymore.

1005
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:25,988
Is he all right?
You sure?

1006
01:20:29,290 --> 01:20:30,622
Where you going?

1007
01:20:30,624 --> 01:20:32,093
No, no.

1008
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:33,992
Okay, don't... no, no.

1009
01:20:33,994 --> 01:20:35,460
Don't... don't play
with the kitties.

1010
01:20:35,462 --> 01:20:36,562
No, no.

1011
01:20:36,564 --> 01:20:38,197
Don't play with the kitties.

1012
01:20:38,199 --> 01:20:39,967
I'm not... I'm not angry.

1013
01:20:44,172 --> 01:20:46,339
Oh, my!

1014
01:20:54,716 --> 01:20:55,948
You did that. It's okay.

1015
01:20:55,950 --> 01:20:57,653
It's... ooh. I don't
think that's sanitary.

1016
01:21:01,489 --> 01:21:03,025
Enough.

1017
01:21:06,394 --> 01:21:08,262
Oh, God.

1018
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:15,236
Interesting guy.

1019
01:21:18,772 --> 01:21:20,206
<i>All personnel
prepare to present</i>

1020
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:22,407
<i>your identity
and clearance cards.</i>

1021
01:21:22,409 --> 01:21:23,944
You wanted to see me?

1022
01:21:27,414 --> 01:21:28,746
How's it going?

1023
01:21:28,748 --> 01:21:30,683
The investigation?

1024
01:21:30,685 --> 01:21:32,320
Well, we have
a promising lead.

1025
01:21:33,154 --> 01:21:34,289
Really?

1026
01:21:36,490 --> 01:21:37,758
That's good to hear.

1027
01:21:38,994 --> 01:21:40,725
You joined us in Galveston,

1028
01:21:40,727 --> 01:21:42,728
but where were
you before, Hoffstetler?

1029
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:44,363
- Doctor.
- Excuse me?

1030
01:21:44,365 --> 01:21:46,301
Doctor Hoffstetler.

1031
01:21:48,535 --> 01:21:49,870
Protocol.

1032
01:21:51,772 --> 01:21:53,706
Wisconsin. Madison.

1033
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:54,907
Oh that's right.

1034
01:21:54,909 --> 01:21:57,443
You gave up a tenure
track position, didn't you?

1035
01:21:57,445 --> 01:22:01,083
Gave it all up for us.

1036
01:22:03,650 --> 01:22:05,251
I suppose...

1037
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:08,621
you'll be getting ready
to leave us now then, huh?

1038
01:22:08,623 --> 01:22:10,357
Only if the creature
isn't found.

1039
01:22:13,660 --> 01:22:14,859
Well, what do you think?

1040
01:22:14,861 --> 01:22:16,094
You think we will find it?

1041
01:22:16,096 --> 01:22:18,499
Well, you said
you had a lead.

1042
01:22:19,667 --> 01:22:21,169
I do.

1043
01:25:11,471 --> 01:25:12,940
Why you smiling, hon?

1044
01:25:14,842 --> 01:25:16,444
Stop looking like that.

1045
01:25:19,047 --> 01:25:20,515
What happened?

1046
01:25:24,251 --> 01:25:25,453
Why?

1047
01:25:26,619 --> 01:25:28,088
How?

1048
01:25:29,123 --> 01:25:30,225
How?

1049
01:25:31,425 --> 01:25:33,427
Does he have a...?

1050
01:25:39,566 --> 01:25:40,935
Mm-hmm.

1051
01:25:42,403 --> 01:25:43,637
Mm-hmm.

1052
01:25:51,177 --> 01:25:53,379
Oh!

1053
01:25:53,381 --> 01:25:55,447
Never trust a man.

1054
01:25:55,449 --> 01:25:57,782
Even when he looks
flat down there.

1055
01:27:17,966 --> 01:27:19,234
Hmm.

1056
01:28:00,106 --> 01:28:03,140
<i>You rang?</i>

1057
01:28:03,142 --> 01:28:06,111
<i>Oh, hi, Maynard. I
just signed up for anthropology.</i>

1058
01:28:06,113 --> 01:28:09,380
<i>We're gonna hold class in the
Amazon jungle in South America.</i>

1059
01:28:09,382 --> 01:28:11,316
<i>South America?
Ooh, man, Dob.</i>

1060
01:28:11,318 --> 01:28:13,051
<i>You're gonna have to get up awful early
in the morning. That's a long hike.</i>

1061
01:28:13,053 --> 01:28:14,952
<i>No, Maynard, we're gonna stay down there.</i>

1062
01:28:14,954 --> 01:28:17,857
<i>- We are?
- Oh, no, you're not coming along, too.</i>

1063
01:28:17,859 --> 01:28:21,428
This is a gelatin parfait.

1064
01:28:22,062 --> 01:28:23,461
You're gonna love it.

1065
01:28:23,463 --> 01:28:24,630
Dad, can we watch <i>Bonanza?</i>

1066
01:28:24,632 --> 01:28:27,032
<i>Bonanza</i> is much too violent.

1067
01:28:27,034 --> 01:28:28,300
You know what
I was thinking today?

1068
01:28:28,302 --> 01:28:31,437
We get the kids
a P-U-P-P-Y.

1069
01:30:30,423 --> 01:30:32,291
Let's go. Come on.

1070
01:30:32,293 --> 01:30:33,528
Let's get out of here.

1071
01:31:20,341 --> 01:31:21,439
What is going on?!

1072
01:31:21,441 --> 01:31:23,809
I've got water
pouring into my theater!

1073
01:31:23,811 --> 01:31:26,511
I have four paying customers!
I've got to offer refunds.

1074
01:31:26,513 --> 01:31:27,880
It's probably a pipe.
I'll take care of it.

1075
01:31:27,882 --> 01:31:29,842
- You don't fix it, no more rent!
- I will fix it.

1076
01:31:46,967 --> 01:31:49,504
Elisa?

1077
01:31:51,305 --> 01:31:53,508
Dear God. Elisa!

1078
01:32:23,169 --> 01:32:25,006
I'm toweling my hair!

1079
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:27,542
It's my hair.

1080
01:32:28,342 --> 01:32:30,341
Ah, just...

1081
01:32:30,343 --> 01:32:31,876
Oh! Look at my arm.

1082
01:32:31,878 --> 01:32:34,112
The wound. It's like
it was never there.

1083
01:32:34,114 --> 01:32:35,515
Look at that.

1084
01:32:36,182 --> 01:32:37,715
Are you said that...

1085
01:32:37,717 --> 01:32:38,983
you know, he was worshiped
like a god.

1086
01:32:38,985 --> 01:32:40,553
Now, is he a god?
I don't know if he's a god.

1087
01:32:40,555 --> 01:32:42,653
I mean, he ate a cat,
so I don't... I don't know.

1088
01:32:42,655 --> 01:32:44,255
I don't know, but, I mean,

1089
01:32:44,257 --> 01:32:45,859
we have to keep him
around awhile.

1090
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:48,729
Little while.

1091
01:33:08,015 --> 01:33:09,117
Hello?

1092
01:34:50,083 --> 01:34:51,218
<i>Your water, sir.</i>

1093
01:34:52,785 --> 01:34:56,054
- And sir, General Hoyt...
- Mm-mm, mm-mm.

1094
01:34:56,056 --> 01:34:57,221
Tell him I'm not here.

1095
01:34:57,223 --> 01:34:59,389
Tell him I'll call him back.
Don't put him through.

1096
01:34:59,391 --> 01:35:00,692
No, sir...

1097
01:35:00,694 --> 01:35:02,562
He... he's in your office.

1098
01:35:05,732 --> 01:35:08,800
At this point,
our only concern is the asset.

1099
01:35:08,802 --> 01:35:11,239
- Do you have it?
- Still in the winds, sir.

1100
01:35:12,338 --> 01:35:13,607
Well, that won't do.

1101
01:35:14,475 --> 01:35:16,043
Yes, sir, I know.

1102
01:35:18,212 --> 01:35:20,645
You've known me
how long, sir?

1103
01:35:20,647 --> 01:35:22,947
Thirteen years.
Battle of Pusan.

1104
01:35:22,949 --> 01:35:24,683
Yes, sir.

1105
01:35:24,685 --> 01:35:27,752
A man is faithful,
loyal, efficient all his life.

1106
01:35:27,754 --> 01:35:30,322
All of it. And he is...

1107
01:35:30,324 --> 01:35:31,290
useful.

1108
01:35:31,292 --> 01:35:33,895
And he expects...

1109
01:35:35,529 --> 01:35:38,232
He has certain
expectations in return.

1110
01:35:40,167 --> 01:35:42,701
And then, he fails once.

1111
01:35:42,703 --> 01:35:45,469
Only once.
What does that make him?

1112
01:35:45,471 --> 01:35:47,107
That make him a failure?

1113
01:35:51,044 --> 01:35:53,077
When is a man done, sir?

1114
01:35:53,079 --> 01:35:55,246
Proving himself?

1115
01:35:55,248 --> 01:35:57,381
A good man?

1116
01:35:57,383 --> 01:35:59,086
A decent man?

1117
01:36:02,922 --> 01:36:04,559
"Decent?"

1118
01:36:08,995 --> 01:36:12,863
A man has the decency
not to fuck up.

1119
01:36:12,865 --> 01:36:14,599
Now that's one thing.

1120
01:36:14,601 --> 01:36:16,835
That's real decent of him.

1121
01:36:16,837 --> 01:36:19,571
But the other kind of decency?

1122
01:36:19,573 --> 01:36:20,706
It doesn't really matter.

1123
01:36:20,708 --> 01:36:23,808
We sell it,
but it's an export.

1124
01:36:23,810 --> 01:36:26,213
We sell it,
because we don't use it.

1125
01:36:27,547 --> 01:36:29,413
36 hours from now...

1126
01:36:29,415 --> 01:36:33,220
this entire episode
will be over.

1127
01:36:35,088 --> 01:36:36,323
And so will you.

1128
01:36:37,891 --> 01:36:41,059
Our universe
will have a hole in it

1129
01:36:41,061 --> 01:36:43,161
with your outline.

1130
01:36:43,163 --> 01:36:45,464
And you will have moved on

1131
01:36:45,466 --> 01:36:47,901
to an alternate universe.

1132
01:36:49,203 --> 01:36:50,972
A universe of shit.

1133
01:36:53,039 --> 01:36:55,709
You'll be lost
to civilization.

1134
01:36:57,910 --> 01:37:00,780
And you will be unborn.

1135
01:37:02,114 --> 01:37:04,150
Unmade.

1136
01:37:05,418 --> 01:37:06,988
And undone.

1137
01:37:13,593 --> 01:37:16,196
So go get some
real decency, son.

1138
01:37:17,330 --> 01:37:19,264
And unfuck this mess.

1139
01:37:55,168 --> 01:37:56,867
36 hours.

1140
01:37:56,869 --> 01:37:58,836
36 hours. Well, shit.

1141
01:37:58,838 --> 01:38:00,639
You deliver. You deliver,
that's what you do.

1142
01:38:00,641 --> 01:38:02,707
You deliver! Right? Right?!

1143
01:38:55,695 --> 01:38:57,464
know...

1144
01:39:16,516 --> 01:39:18,119
You'll...

1145
01:39:19,352 --> 01:39:21,254
never know...

1146
01:39:22,355 --> 01:39:25,291
just how much...

1147
01:39:27,561 --> 01:39:29,428
I...

1148
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:32,466
love you.

1149
01:39:34,568 --> 01:39:37,268
You'll...

1150
01:39:37,270 --> 01:39:39,604
never know...

1151
01:39:39,606 --> 01:39:41,839
just how much...

1152
01:40:49,842 --> 01:40:52,577
You'll never know...

1153
01:40:52,579 --> 01:40:56,715
if you don't know now.

1154
01:41:19,205 --> 01:41:20,373
Elisa...

1155
01:41:22,676 --> 01:41:24,245
What is it, honey?

1156
01:41:50,936 --> 01:41:52,538
This isn't good.

1157
01:41:55,309 --> 01:41:57,244
I'm gonna call Dr. Hoffstetler.

1158
01:41:59,378 --> 01:42:01,247
We gotta release him
tonight, honey.

1159
01:42:01,914 --> 01:42:03,550
I'll come back and help you.

1160
01:42:27,973 --> 01:42:29,308
He's coming out.

1161
01:42:35,315 --> 01:42:36,947
Ah, fuck.

1162
01:42:41,521 --> 01:42:43,888
Sir, if you don't
mind me saying, you...

1163
01:42:43,890 --> 01:42:45,258
you don't look so well.

1164
01:42:45,926 --> 01:42:47,294
Shut up.

1165
01:42:49,628 --> 01:42:51,595
Can you smell that?
I mean...

1166
01:42:51,597 --> 01:42:53,698
I think it's your fingers.
They're... they're...

1167
01:42:53,700 --> 01:42:56,169
- Mmm.
- black.

1168
01:43:00,707 --> 01:43:02,541
There he is.

1169
01:43:02,543 --> 01:43:04,207
Doctor-fucking-shitbird.

1170
01:43:04,209 --> 01:43:06,010
Oh, there's no cause
for cursing, sir.

1171
01:43:10,784 --> 01:43:12,753
Get out of the car.
I'm taking it.

1172
01:43:13,954 --> 01:43:15,185
This is my car.

1173
01:43:15,187 --> 01:43:16,720
Get the fuck out.

1174
01:43:16,722 --> 01:43:18,225
Out of my car?

1175
01:43:18,891 --> 01:43:20,493
Did I stutter?

1176
01:44:53,287 --> 01:44:54,719
Strickland! Thank God!

1177
01:44:54,721 --> 01:44:57,288
You were speaking Russian...

1178
01:44:57,290 --> 01:44:58,355
Bob.

1179
01:45:10,235 --> 01:45:11,469
What's your name?

1180
01:45:11,471 --> 01:45:14,304
- Hoffstetler.
- No, no. Don't lie.

1181
01:45:14,306 --> 01:45:15,605
You don't need to.

1182
01:45:15,607 --> 01:45:18,542
You took a bullet to the gut.

1183
01:45:18,544 --> 01:45:19,777
You're dead.

1184
01:45:19,779 --> 01:45:21,379
I need the names, ranks

1185
01:45:21,381 --> 01:45:23,747
and location
of the entire strike team.

1186
01:45:23,749 --> 01:45:25,416
"Strike team?"

1187
01:45:25,418 --> 01:45:28,319
The ones who took the asset!

1188
01:45:37,129 --> 01:45:40,531
This candy.
It's cheap candy, but I love it.

1189
01:45:40,533 --> 01:45:43,334
Ever since I was a kid.

1190
01:45:43,336 --> 01:45:46,603
Now some folks favor
more sophisticated snacks,

1191
01:45:46,605 --> 01:45:50,073
nougat center
and all that foo-foo shit.

1192
01:45:50,075 --> 01:45:52,245
But not me, Bob!

1193
01:45:53,079 --> 01:45:54,414
This is it for me.

1194
01:45:57,283 --> 01:45:59,884
Now sometimes
if I'm feeling anxious,

1195
01:45:59,886 --> 01:46:00,926
I just bite right into it.

1196
01:46:01,654 --> 01:46:03,621
But mostly,

1197
01:46:03,623 --> 01:46:05,324
I take my time.

1198
01:46:05,825 --> 01:46:07,192
I make it last.

1199
01:46:12,498 --> 01:46:14,131
Names, ranks,

1200
01:46:14,133 --> 01:46:16,134
and location
of the strike team.

1201
01:46:19,838 --> 01:46:22,072
Names! Ranks! Now!

1202
01:46:26,745 --> 01:46:28,248
No names.

1203
01:46:29,516 --> 01:46:30,918
No ranks.

1204
01:46:31,751 --> 01:46:33,287
They...

1205
01:46:34,020 --> 01:46:35,318
They just clean.

1206
01:46:46,531 --> 01:46:48,733
Alright, Brewster,
I'm gonna fix your dinner,

1207
01:46:48,735 --> 01:46:51,505
and then I'm gonna run out for a
little while and help a friend.

1208
01:46:52,905 --> 01:46:54,205
Help with what?

1209
01:46:54,207 --> 01:46:55,740
Help a friend.

1210
01:46:58,077 --> 01:46:59,910
Zelda...

1211
01:46:59,912 --> 01:47:01,347
the door.

1212
01:47:04,784 --> 01:47:07,417
Well, you could help me
and answer the door, Brewster.

1213
01:47:07,419 --> 01:47:09,687
You're sitting right here
just ten feet away from it!

1214
01:47:09,689 --> 01:47:11,555
My back's aching me, woman.
Now, move!

1215
01:47:11,557 --> 01:47:13,827
Your back, your back?
Always your back!

1216
01:47:17,062 --> 01:47:18,431
Mr. Strickland.

1217
01:47:19,164 --> 01:47:20,965
What are you doing here?

1218
01:47:20,967 --> 01:47:22,300
Who's that man, Zelda?

1219
01:47:22,302 --> 01:47:23,600
Where is it?

1220
01:47:23,602 --> 01:47:25,135
- What are you talking about?
- Where did you take it?

1221
01:47:25,137 --> 01:47:27,657
- What are you talking about? I... I don't...
- Zelda!

1222
01:47:29,242 --> 01:47:32,311
The thing in the lab.

1223
01:47:33,613 --> 01:47:34,545
Where is it?

1224
01:47:34,547 --> 01:47:36,683
- Listen, fella...
- Sit down!

1225
01:47:46,092 --> 01:47:47,224
I'm sorry, sir.

1226
01:47:47,226 --> 01:47:49,662
If I knew anything,
I would surely tell you.

1227
01:47:54,100 --> 01:47:56,270
That story about Samson.

1228
01:47:57,235 --> 01:47:59,370
I never told you how it ends.

1229
01:47:59,372 --> 01:48:03,944
After the Philistines
torture him and blind him...

1230
01:48:05,378 --> 01:48:08,582
Samson asks God
for the strength he needs.

1231
01:48:10,283 --> 01:48:13,384
And at the last minute,
he is spared.

1232
01:48:13,386 --> 01:48:18,156
And the Lord gives him
his strength back...

1233
01:48:18,158 --> 01:48:19,526
one last time.

1234
01:48:22,195 --> 01:48:24,698
And he holds...

1235
01:48:25,565 --> 01:48:28,933
the columns of the temple...

1236
01:48:28,935 --> 01:48:30,401
with his powerful arms.

1237
01:48:30,403 --> 01:48:33,307
And he crushes them.

1238
01:48:44,784 --> 01:48:46,483
And he brings
the whole building

1239
01:48:46,485 --> 01:48:48,587
down on the Philistines.

1240
01:48:54,026 --> 01:48:55,526
He dies...

1241
01:48:55,528 --> 01:48:59,833
but he gets every single
one of those motherfuckers.

1242
01:49:00,432 --> 01:49:01,801
That is his will!

1243
01:49:05,771 --> 01:49:10,543
Now, do you know what that
particular story means...

1244
01:49:11,477 --> 01:49:13,978
for us, Delilah?

1245
01:49:13,980 --> 01:49:16,447
It means if you know something
you're not telling me

1246
01:49:16,449 --> 01:49:18,416
you're gonna tell me

1247
01:49:18,418 --> 01:49:22,519
either before or after

1248
01:49:22,521 --> 01:49:24,925
I bring
this particular temple...

1249
01:49:26,258 --> 01:49:29,960
down upon our heads.

1250
01:49:29,962 --> 01:49:32,395
Gal stole that
thing right out the lab,

1251
01:49:32,397 --> 01:49:33,964
whatever it is.

1252
01:49:33,966 --> 01:49:36,332
Mute girl took it.

1253
01:49:36,334 --> 01:49:39,138
I heard my wife talking
on the phone about it.

1254
01:49:43,642 --> 01:49:45,943
Thank you very much,
Mr. Fuller,

1255
01:49:45,945 --> 01:49:47,747
for your assistance.

1256
01:49:58,859 --> 01:50:00,692
What have you done?

1257
01:50:00,694 --> 01:50:01,492
Zelda.

1258
01:50:01,494 --> 01:50:02,626
I gotta warn her.

1259
01:50:02,628 --> 01:50:04,327
He's going after her.

1260
01:50:04,329 --> 01:50:06,529
You will do
no such thing, woman.

1261
01:50:06,531 --> 01:50:07,865
Why are you worrying about her?

1262
01:50:07,867 --> 01:50:09,265
She broke the law.

1263
01:50:09,267 --> 01:50:11,437
Shut up, Brewster!
You shut up!

1264
01:50:12,137 --> 01:50:14,039
Years, you don't talk...

1265
01:50:15,408 --> 01:50:18,309
and now you can't
shut your mouth!

1266
01:50:18,311 --> 01:50:19,679
Damn you, Brewster.

1267
01:50:22,015 --> 01:50:23,915
You wouldn't understand.

1268
01:50:23,917 --> 01:50:28,385
Couldn't understand, not if
you tried your whole life.

1269
01:50:28,387 --> 01:50:30,520
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Giles, is that you?

1270
01:50:30,522 --> 01:50:32,525
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Okay. Put Elisa on the phone.

1271
01:50:33,126 --> 01:50:34,127
It's Zelda.

1272
01:50:35,828 --> 01:50:38,862
Elisa, honey, make a sound
on the phone if you can hear.

1273
01:50:40,065 --> 01:50:41,066
<i>Okay, good.</i>

1274
01:50:41,734 --> 01:50:43,267
He's coming for you.

1275
01:50:43,269 --> 01:50:45,937
<i>You gotta go now, and you gotta
take that thing with you.</i>

1276
01:50:45,939 --> 01:50:47,039
What? Elisa?

1277
01:50:55,547 --> 01:50:58,150
Hey! Watch out!
Learn how to drive!

1278
01:51:28,181 --> 01:51:29,583
Damn it.

1279
01:51:41,160 --> 01:51:42,761
We have to go.

1280
01:51:45,131 --> 01:51:46,796
Where are you?

1281
01:51:46,798 --> 01:51:48,398
Where the fuck are you?

1282
01:54:12,044 --> 01:54:13,846
I do not fail.

1283
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:16,915
I deliver.

1284
01:54:22,055 --> 01:54:23,189
Elisa!

1285
01:54:24,390 --> 01:54:26,059
Elisa.

1286
01:54:34,868 --> 01:54:35,869
No.

1287
01:55:24,050 --> 01:55:25,150
Fuck.

1288
01:55:26,351 --> 01:55:27,986
You are a god.

1289
01:56:02,387 --> 01:56:03,756
Look, man on the ground.

1290
01:56:04,589 --> 01:56:06,025
Watch him.

1291
01:56:12,864 --> 01:56:15,200
You there! Call an ambulance!

1292
01:57:35,013 --> 01:57:36,913
<i>If I told you about her,</i>

1293
01:57:36,915 --> 01:57:38,982
<i>what would I say?</i>

1294
01:57:38,984 --> 01:57:41,919
<i>That they lived
happily ever after?</i>

1295
01:57:41,921 --> 01:57:44,455
<i>I believe they did.</i>

1296
01:57:44,457 --> 01:57:48,459
<i>That they were in love,
that they remained in love?</i>

1297
01:57:48,461 --> 01:57:50,463
<i>I'm sure that's true.</i>

1298
01:57:51,230 --> 01:57:53,299
<i>But when I think of her...</i>

1299
01:57:54,234 --> 01:57:56,434
<i>of Elisa...</i>

1300
01:57:56,436 --> 01:57:59,402
<i>the only thing that comes
to mind is a poem</i>

1301
01:57:59,404 --> 01:58:04,340
<i>whispered by someone in love,
hundreds of years ago.</i>

1302
01:58:04,342 --> 01:58:07,312
<i>"Unable to perceive
the shape of You</i>

1303
01:58:08,213 --> 01:58:11,048
<i>"I find You all around me</i>

1304
01:58:11,050 --> 01:58:14,454
<i>"Your presence fills my eyes
with Your love</i>

1305
01:58:15,454 --> 01:58:17,754
<i>"It humbles my heart</i>

1306
01:58:17,756 --> 01:58:19,790
<i>For You are everywhere"</i>
