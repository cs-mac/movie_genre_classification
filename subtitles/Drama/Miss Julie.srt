1
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,534
"She had received
a most beautiful doll

2
00:00:48,566 --> 00:00:50,390
as a present.

3
00:00:50,422 --> 00:00:53,686
Oh, what a glorious doll,
so fair and delicate.

4
00:00:53,718 --> 00:00:55,863
She did not seem
created

5
00:00:55,894 --> 00:00:57,751
for the sorrows
of this world."

6
00:01:29,655 --> 00:01:32,152
Mommy.

7
00:01:34,583 --> 00:01:36,440
Mommy.

8
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:03,389
Diana.

9
00:04:14,812 --> 00:04:17,244
Took the baron
to the train.

10
00:04:17,276 --> 00:04:19,549
Funny, Miss Julie
isn't going with him.

11
00:04:19,581 --> 00:04:22,461
I mean, all their friends
are celebrating Midsummer together,

12
00:04:22,492 --> 00:04:25,021
big event.

13
00:04:25,052 --> 00:04:26,973
Left me his boots
to polish.

14
00:04:27,005 --> 00:04:28,925
Changed into something
more fancy,

15
00:04:28,957 --> 00:04:30,878
His Fanciness,

16
00:04:30,909 --> 00:04:34,941
His Most Divine
Fanciness,

17
00:04:34,973 --> 00:04:38,365
His Vainglorious,
Most Elegant Highness.

18
00:04:38,397 --> 00:04:40,478
Sir Boots, I think.

19
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,398
So the baron
went into the station and told me to wait,

20
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,029
said he'd have
something for me.

21
00:04:44,061 --> 00:04:45,437
When I see him
come out of the station,

22
00:04:45,469 --> 00:04:47,166
he was putting something
in a folder.

23
00:04:47,197 --> 00:04:49,181
Guess what was
in the folder.

24
00:04:49,213 --> 00:04:52,350
A packet
of travel brochures.

25
00:04:52,382 --> 00:04:54,526
Like that's how
someone like me travels.

26
00:04:54,558 --> 00:04:56,766
But no money, no.

27
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,782
They don't
think that way, not those people.

28
00:04:58,813 --> 00:05:01,438
No, they don't think
that way.

29
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,486
And then I leave
and I'm carrying his boots

30
00:05:03,518 --> 00:05:06,110
and I pass the barn and ask the stable boy
to take the horses home

31
00:05:06,142 --> 00:05:08,094
and I go in.

32
00:05:08,126 --> 00:05:10,142
And there
I see Miss Julie leading the dance

33
00:05:10,174 --> 00:05:12,959
with the gamekeeper--
the gamekeeper.

34
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,743
And what do you know?
She sees me and she rushes over to me, Kathleen,

35
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:19,807
and commands me, Kathleen--
commands me to dance with her.

36
00:05:19,838 --> 00:05:23,582
She thinks she can
control everyone.

37
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:26,431
Who am I?
I can't control anything.

38
00:05:28,735 --> 00:05:31,135
Oh, Kathleen, come and look
at these pictures.

39
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:33,535
Look, Paris.

40
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,296
Rome.

41
00:05:36,863 --> 00:05:39,071
This is Lake Como.

42
00:05:39,103 --> 00:05:41,951
Oh, I know
about that place.

43
00:05:43,775 --> 00:05:45,696
Lord, it's lovely.

44
00:05:50,527 --> 00:05:52,384
I'm hungry.

45
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,152
It's kidney,
your favorite.

46
00:06:01,184 --> 00:06:03,104
Delightful.

47
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:06,529
Yes, you are right.
This is my big délice.

48
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,545
You should have
warmed my plate.

49
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,721
You're harder to please
than the baron himself.

50
00:06:10,752 --> 00:06:12,641
Get me a glass.

51
00:06:15,905 --> 00:06:18,304
A proper one,
a fancy one.

52
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,897
When one is drinking
bon vin...

53
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,153
Oh.

54
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:38,401
It's good.
It's pretty good.

55
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:40,257
It's a tiny bit
too cold.

56
00:06:42,465 --> 00:06:44,641
-What are you cooking
with that infernal smell?

57
00:06:44,673 --> 00:06:47,906
Oh, just some devil the young lady has me
making up for the dog.

58
00:06:56,961 --> 00:07:00,034
Miss Julie thinks
it's pregnant again,

59
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:03,202
because she's been,
ah, you know,

60
00:07:03,234 --> 00:07:06,562
close to
the gamekeeper's dog.

61
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,283
Miss Julie told me
she watched them

62
00:07:09,314 --> 00:07:11,234
and it made her sick.

63
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:13,923
And now she'd rather
risk the dog die from the remedy

64
00:07:13,954 --> 00:07:16,963
than have a mixed breed.
God save her.

65
00:07:16,994 --> 00:07:19,810
You should have seen her
coming to the dance.

66
00:07:19,842 --> 00:07:22,915
Looked like she'd been lying
on the ground having a nap.

67
00:07:25,475 --> 00:07:26,883
We wouldn't act
in that way.

68
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:31,235
But still,
she's elegant--

69
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:33,186
Miss Julie--

70
00:07:33,218 --> 00:07:35,267
magnificent.

71
00:07:35,298 --> 00:07:38,755
Oh, her waist,
her neck.

72
00:07:38,786 --> 00:07:40,131
Stop it.

73
00:07:45,475 --> 00:07:47,843
I've heard Clara
talking.

74
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,404
She's seen her naked

75
00:07:50,435 --> 00:07:52,324
lots of times

76
00:07:52,355 --> 00:07:53,732
when she gives her
a bath--

77
00:07:53,763 --> 00:07:55,396
Oh, Clara--

78
00:07:55,427 --> 00:07:57,636
too cross-eyed
to get anything right.

79
00:07:57,668 --> 00:08:00,067
You women, you're always
jealous of each other.

80
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:02,276
Listen, I, who have been
out riding with her--

81
00:08:02,308 --> 00:08:04,004
I know her
well enough--

82
00:08:04,036 --> 00:08:06,916
the way
she sits a horse, her legs,

83
00:08:06,948 --> 00:08:09,381
and then
the way she dances.

84
00:08:26,821 --> 00:08:30,565
Well,

85
00:08:30,596 --> 00:08:32,741
is it done--

86
00:08:32,773 --> 00:08:35,077
my abortive poison?

87
00:08:43,525 --> 00:08:46,213
Is it some kind of
witches' broth

88
00:08:46,245 --> 00:08:49,029
you ladies are cooking
on Midsummer Eve, huh?

89
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:53,670
Listen.

90
00:08:57,733 --> 00:08:59,814
Come, dance
with me again.

91
00:08:59,845 --> 00:09:02,406
I don't want
to be impolite,

92
00:09:02,438 --> 00:09:05,063
but I have promised
to dance with Kathleen.

93
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:09,638
Let me borrow him,
Kathleen.

94
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,398
You go and rest.

95
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,926
If Miss Julie
is so gracious,

96
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,974
it isn't for him
to say no.

97
00:09:16,006 --> 00:09:19,142
Go along, John.
Be thankful for the honor.

98
00:09:19,173 --> 00:09:21,638
Frankly speaking,

99
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,039
but not wishing
to offend in any way,

100
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,246
I cannot help wondering
if it's wise

101
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:29,095
for Miss Julie
to dance twice with the same partner.

102
00:09:29,127 --> 00:09:30,695
What are you
talking about?

103
00:09:30,726 --> 00:09:33,383
I, the mistress of the house,
honor the workers' dance,

104
00:09:33,415 --> 00:09:36,263
in the barn,
with my presence.

105
00:09:36,295 --> 00:09:38,823
Since I really want
to dance,

106
00:09:38,854 --> 00:09:40,807
I have to dance
with someone who knows the steps,

107
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:42,919
so I don't look
ridiculous.

108
00:09:45,735 --> 00:09:48,039
As you command,
Miss Julie.

109
00:09:53,319 --> 00:09:56,359
I am at your service.

110
00:09:56,391 --> 00:09:59,015
I have chosen
to forget all rank,

111
00:09:59,047 --> 00:10:01,768
and so must you.

112
00:10:03,143 --> 00:10:05,544
Come, give me your arm.

113
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,744
Thank you, John.

114
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:11,784
I really don't
want to treat you as an inferior.

115
00:10:11,816 --> 00:10:13,800
Let us go through
the entrance hall.

116
00:10:13,832 --> 00:10:15,752
You would like that,
wouldn't you?

117
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:19,464
Don't be afraid,
Kathleen.

118
00:10:19,496 --> 00:10:22,024
I won't run away
with your fiancé.

119
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:24,521
That's what he is,
isn't he?

120
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:57,578
You're a man of the future,
aren't you?

121
00:11:16,713 --> 00:11:18,858
-Diana, come here.

122
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:20,650
Come on.

123
00:11:20,682 --> 00:11:23,530
My love, come here.
Come here.

124
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:30,090
Poor you.

125
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,202
I know.

126
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:34,538
I did not put very much
in your food.

127
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,779
It's mostly
good meat.

128
00:11:37,834 --> 00:11:39,691
You'll be fine.

129
00:11:43,082 --> 00:11:45,003
Shh.

130
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:00,907
Listen.

131
00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:02,860
You like it?

132
00:12:04,203 --> 00:12:06,284
You stay here.

133
00:12:19,115 --> 00:12:20,972
I left her.

134
00:12:22,603 --> 00:12:25,293
She's strange,
Kathleen.

135
00:12:26,956 --> 00:12:29,164
She's always strange.

136
00:12:32,812 --> 00:12:35,052
Are you upset with me?

137
00:12:35,084 --> 00:12:37,261
Why?

138
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:39,853
For small things
like the two of you walking off?

139
00:12:47,116 --> 00:12:50,412
You are a sensible girl,

140
00:12:50,444 --> 00:12:52,397
Kathleen.

141
00:12:52,428 --> 00:12:54,765
You'll make
a good wife.

142
00:12:56,237 --> 00:12:58,413
Can you imagine
what the baron would say

143
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,621
if he saw
her behavior?

144
00:13:00,652 --> 00:13:02,541
Huh?
Did you see her?

145
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,429
See her?

146
00:13:11,405 --> 00:13:13,390
Is it possible?

147
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,582
Are you flattered?

148
00:13:26,477 --> 00:13:29,167
Don't be another dog,
will you?

149
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,478
You are such a charming
cavalier,

150
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,431
running away
from a lady.

151
00:13:39,214 --> 00:13:41,102
As you can see,

152
00:13:41,134 --> 00:13:43,022
I hurried back

153
00:13:43,054 --> 00:13:45,167
to be with the lady
I had deserted.

154
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:53,743
Why are you
wearing your livery on Midsummer Night?

155
00:13:53,774 --> 00:13:56,047
Remove it at once.

156
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:59,022
Then I must ask
if I can go to my room.

157
00:13:59,054 --> 00:14:01,263
My black coat
is hanging there.

158
00:14:01,295 --> 00:14:03,216
Go to your room then.

159
00:14:06,191 --> 00:14:08,208
And I will go too,
and make sure

160
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:09,999
you don't run away
from me again.

161
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:12,623
Miss Julie,
with your permission,

162
00:14:12,655 --> 00:14:14,768
may I go and get it?

163
00:15:02,961 --> 00:15:04,849
Kathleen,

164
00:15:04,881 --> 00:15:06,994
are you and John
engaged?

165
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:10,097
Engaged?

166
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:13,777
You seem so familiar.

167
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:18,001
In a way.
We call it that.

168
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:20,721
You call it that?

169
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,506
Were you not engaged
yourself, Miss Julie?

170
00:15:28,497 --> 00:15:30,385
Miss Julie,

171
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:32,306
I am tired.

172
00:15:32,337 --> 00:15:34,482
Would you mind if I go
to my room and--?

173
00:15:45,682 --> 00:15:48,626
Where did you learn
to speak French?

174
00:15:48,658 --> 00:15:51,250
In Switzerland.

175
00:15:51,282 --> 00:15:53,778
I was the wine waiter
at the one of the biggest hotels in Lucerne.

176
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,562
You look like
a perfect gentleman.

177
00:15:56,594 --> 00:15:58,162
Charmant.

178
00:15:58,194 --> 00:16:01,106
-You flatter me.
-Why would I flatter you?

179
00:16:01,138 --> 00:16:03,443
Oh, well,
my natural modesty forbids me to believe

180
00:16:03,474 --> 00:16:05,363
that you would give
someone like me

181
00:16:05,394 --> 00:16:07,251
such genuine
compliments,

182
00:16:07,283 --> 00:16:09,971
and so I dare to assume
that you were flattering me,

183
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:12,883
or worse,
patronizing me.

184
00:16:14,387 --> 00:16:17,108
Where did you learn
to talk like that?

185
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:19,347
You'd be surprised

186
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,555
to know the places
I have visited.

187
00:16:21,586 --> 00:16:24,980
But you were born
in this area, weren't you?

188
00:16:25,011 --> 00:16:26,388
Aye.

189
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,691
My father worked the land
right across the way.

190
00:16:28,723 --> 00:16:30,611
And I visited
your garden

191
00:16:30,643 --> 00:16:32,723
long before I came
to work for the baron.

192
00:16:32,755 --> 00:16:34,643
I saw you

193
00:16:34,675 --> 00:16:36,692
when you were
a little girl.

194
00:16:36,723 --> 00:16:39,316
But you, Miss Julie,
did not notice me.

195
00:16:39,347 --> 00:16:43,092
Who gave you permission
to walk in our garden?

196
00:16:43,123 --> 00:16:45,236
I remember one time--

197
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,796
No.

198
00:16:51,828 --> 00:16:54,612
I'm not
going to tell you.

199
00:16:54,644 --> 00:16:56,596
Is it bad?

200
00:16:56,628 --> 00:16:58,516
It isn't.

201
00:16:58,548 --> 00:17:00,469
But Kathleen
might hear me.

202
00:17:02,261 --> 00:17:04,309
From her room?

203
00:17:26,677 --> 00:17:29,558
I think she's snoring.

204
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:32,245
She doesn't.

205
00:17:32,277 --> 00:17:34,326
But she talks
in her sleep.

206
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:38,326
How would you know?

207
00:18:27,095 --> 00:18:28,919
Why don't you
sit down?

208
00:18:28,951 --> 00:18:32,087
It wouldn't be
proper

209
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:34,136
in front of
Miss Julie.

210
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:36,760
And if I order you
to do it?

211
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,711
I'll obey.

212
00:18:46,263 --> 00:18:48,248
Get me something
to drink.

213
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:53,304
I'm not sure
what we have in the icebox.

214
00:18:53,335 --> 00:18:57,144
-I believe it's only beer.
-My taste is simple.

215
00:18:57,176 --> 00:18:59,065
I want beer.

216
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:24,825
Miss Julie.

217
00:19:24,856 --> 00:19:26,745
Thank you.

218
00:19:26,776 --> 00:19:28,537
Are you not
going to drink?

219
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:30,457
I don't like beer,

220
00:19:30,489 --> 00:19:32,377
but of course
if you order me...

221
00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:35,097
I thought a polite gentleman
should keep his lady company.

222
00:19:35,129 --> 00:19:37,210
A point well taken.

223
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,435
Toast me.

224
00:20:00,154 --> 00:20:02,715
Are you bashful?

225
00:20:26,427 --> 00:20:28,956
To your health,
Miss Julie.

226
00:20:30,906 --> 00:20:32,955
Bravo.

227
00:20:37,691 --> 00:20:39,579
Now kiss my shoe,

228
00:20:39,611 --> 00:20:41,788
to get it
just right.

229
00:21:23,772 --> 00:21:25,661
Excellent.

230
00:21:25,692 --> 00:21:28,157
You should have been
an actor.

231
00:21:30,428 --> 00:21:32,414
This won't do.

232
00:21:35,101 --> 00:21:36,989
Miss Julie,

233
00:21:37,021 --> 00:21:38,845
somebody might see us.

234
00:21:38,877 --> 00:21:40,765
What would that matter?

235
00:21:40,797 --> 00:21:43,006
They would start
talking.

236
00:21:43,037 --> 00:21:44,926
Miss Julie
should have heard

237
00:21:44,957 --> 00:21:47,005
how their tongues were wagging
when we danced.

238
00:21:47,037 --> 00:21:48,926
What were they saying?
Sit down.

239
00:21:51,773 --> 00:21:53,181
Tell me.

240
00:21:53,213 --> 00:21:55,998
Ah, you know.
You're not a child.

241
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:58,014
When one sees a lady drinking alone
with a man--

242
00:21:58,046 --> 00:22:00,030
a servant in the night-- 
then--

243
00:22:00,062 --> 00:22:01,374
We're not alone.

244
00:22:01,405 --> 00:22:03,870
We have Kathleen.
Let's go and get her.

245
00:22:03,902 --> 00:22:05,086
Leave her!

246
00:22:09,214 --> 00:22:10,878
What?

247
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:13,822
You shouldn't bother
those who are resting.

248
00:22:13,854 --> 00:22:16,638
She's been working all day,
standing over the stove,

249
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,199
even cooking
for your dog.

250
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:24,959
She's earned a rest.

251
00:22:31,295 --> 00:22:33,727
How nice you are.

252
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:46,111
Shall we go
and pick some lilacs?

253
00:22:50,303 --> 00:22:53,663
I can't do that.

254
00:22:53,695 --> 00:22:55,680
Absolutely not.

255
00:22:56,703 --> 00:22:58,560
I order you.

256
00:23:04,703 --> 00:23:06,240
Go.

257
00:23:45,953 --> 00:23:48,481
I'm sorry,
Miss Julie.

258
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:51,777
She was sick with
the broth you asked me to give her.

259
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:55,490
And I hardly
gave her any.

260
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:57,506
I mean, it could have
killed her.

261
00:24:00,097 --> 00:24:03,170
I like to take her out
in the sunshine.

262
00:24:03,202 --> 00:24:05,602
She loves
to run around

263
00:24:05,634 --> 00:24:07,874
in circles
in the grass.

264
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:10,722
And then she drops down
on the warm stone steps

265
00:24:10,753 --> 00:24:13,026
and spreads out
with the sun on her back.

266
00:24:13,058 --> 00:24:15,234
I see.

267
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,675
You may keep her.

268
00:24:25,058 --> 00:24:26,946
It's John's.

269
00:24:26,978 --> 00:24:29,315
Take the rest.

270
00:24:38,563 --> 00:24:41,507
I sent him out
to pick flowers for me--

271
00:24:43,267 --> 00:24:45,603
lilacs.

272
00:24:51,203 --> 00:24:53,379
Miss Julie,

273
00:24:53,411 --> 00:24:55,620
I am tired.

274
00:24:55,651 --> 00:24:58,019
And if you don't
need me anymore,

275
00:24:58,051 --> 00:25:00,740
may I go
to sleep?

276
00:26:10,565 --> 00:26:13,702
Why wouldn't you go out
to the garden with me?

277
00:26:15,845 --> 00:26:18,630
I don't understand
what you're scared of.

278
00:26:19,749 --> 00:26:21,542
My father
isn't even home.

279
00:26:21,573 --> 00:26:24,902
And the other people--

280
00:26:24,934 --> 00:26:28,230
they are hired
to work here like you.

281
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,718
Do you think
they would believe

282
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,830
that I'm in love
with a valet?

283
00:26:33,862 --> 00:26:36,039
Such things happen.

284
00:26:38,566 --> 00:26:40,615
It may be.

285
00:26:40,646 --> 00:26:43,079
What an imagination.

286
00:26:49,862 --> 00:26:52,263
I could step down.

287
00:26:52,294 --> 00:26:55,815
Don't step down,
Miss Julie.

288
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:57,799
They will say
you fell.

289
00:27:19,752 --> 00:27:21,896
You are strange.

290
00:27:24,871 --> 00:27:28,616
So are you.
Life is strange,

291
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:31,176
people-- 
everything.

292
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,985
We're just foam
floating on water

293
00:27:35,016 --> 00:27:36,905
until we sink.

294
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,353
Sometimes I dream
that I'm on top of a column

295
00:27:41,384 --> 00:27:44,521
and I can't
get down.

296
00:27:44,552 --> 00:27:46,632
I'm almost fainting
when I look down,

297
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,937
but I must
get down.

298
00:27:50,344 --> 00:27:52,425
I'm so scared
to fall.

299
00:27:54,825 --> 00:27:57,289
I can no longer hold on
and I long to fall.

300
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,305
But I don't fall.

301
00:27:59,336 --> 00:28:01,385
Yet there's
no peace,

302
00:28:01,417 --> 00:28:03,690
no rest
till I come down.

303
00:28:05,321 --> 00:28:08,842
I would be descending.
I would fall.

304
00:28:12,137 --> 00:28:15,242
And if I reach the ground,
I want to go further down.

305
00:28:18,633 --> 00:28:21,258
Deep into the earth
itself.

306
00:28:25,577 --> 00:28:28,074
Did you ever
feel this?

307
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:32,203
No, no, I--

308
00:28:34,538 --> 00:28:36,714
I dream that I am lying
under a tall tree

309
00:28:36,746 --> 00:28:39,594
in a dark forest and...

310
00:28:39,626 --> 00:28:41,610
I want to go up,

311
00:28:41,642 --> 00:28:43,530
up to the top,
and look around

312
00:28:43,562 --> 00:28:46,475
at the bright landscape
where the sun is shining

313
00:28:46,506 --> 00:28:48,555
and so I can rob
the nest

314
00:28:48,586 --> 00:28:50,475
in which lies
the golden eggs.

315
00:28:52,683 --> 00:28:54,730
And I climb
and climb.

316
00:28:54,762 --> 00:28:58,731
But the trunk is so thick
and so slippery,

317
00:28:58,762 --> 00:29:02,315
and it is so far
to the first branch.

318
00:29:02,346 --> 00:29:04,619
But I know
that if I can only reach

319
00:29:04,651 --> 00:29:06,667
that first branch,

320
00:29:06,699 --> 00:29:09,547
then I would easily
reach the top.

321
00:29:12,203 --> 00:29:16,396
I haven't
reached it yet--

322
00:29:16,427 --> 00:29:20,651
that first branch--
but I will,

323
00:29:20,683 --> 00:29:22,891
if it only be
in my dreams.

324
00:29:30,828 --> 00:29:34,668
Are you ever
afraid to hear

325
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,933
that you're
no longer wanted?

326
00:29:40,108 --> 00:29:42,604
That you
don't belong?

327
00:29:47,756 --> 00:29:50,572
I shared a bed

328
00:29:50,604 --> 00:29:52,492
with my
little brother,

329
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:55,245
and one morning
when I was eight

330
00:29:55,276 --> 00:29:58,157
I woke up and found him
dead beside me.

331
00:30:01,836 --> 00:30:05,229
I saw death for the first time
and, yes, I was afraid,

332
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,309
but not in the way
you're talking about.

333
00:30:07,341 --> 00:30:10,925
I mean,

334
00:30:10,956 --> 00:30:13,453
my wee brother,

335
00:30:13,484 --> 00:30:17,549
his open coffin--

336
00:30:17,581 --> 00:30:21,645
frost was creeping
into my backbone then.

337
00:30:21,677 --> 00:30:25,901
It's always there.
It's in me.

338
00:30:35,469 --> 00:30:39,662
I will never go back
to what I was born into,

339
00:30:39,694 --> 00:30:42,063
where I used
to belong.

340
00:30:55,342 --> 00:30:58,095
Come, come, let us pick
nine Midsummer flowers

341
00:30:58,126 --> 00:31:00,015
and put them
under our pillows, Miss Julie,

342
00:31:00,046 --> 00:31:01,966
and all our dreams
will come true.

343
00:31:01,998 --> 00:31:03,886
-Let me see what you've got in your eye.
-Oh, it's nothing.

344
00:31:03,918 --> 00:31:05,711
It's just a bit of dirt.
It'll be gone in a minute.

345
00:31:05,742 --> 00:31:07,599
Sit down.

346
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:18,736
Sit still.

347
00:31:21,231 --> 00:31:23,824
My,

348
00:31:23,855 --> 00:31:26,031
I think
you're shaking.

349
00:31:26,063 --> 00:31:28,368
Careful.

350
00:31:37,135 --> 00:31:39,248
Sit still.

351
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:48,432
Yes.

352
00:31:50,351 --> 00:31:52,208
Now it's gone.

353
00:31:55,408 --> 00:31:58,481
Kiss my hand
and say thank you.

354
00:31:58,512 --> 00:32:01,136
Miss Julie, listen to me. Kathleen is close by.
Will you listen to me?

355
00:32:01,168 --> 00:32:02,800
-Kiss my hand first.
-Listen to me.

356
00:32:02,832 --> 00:32:04,976
-Kiss my hand first.
-Blame yourself then.

357
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:06,832
-For what?
-For what?

358
00:32:06,864 --> 00:32:08,977
Are you a child?

359
00:32:11,056 --> 00:32:13,361
You're playing with fire.

360
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:16,209
-I'm not. I'm dreaming.
-No, you're not.

361
00:32:19,089 --> 00:32:20,561
Shame.

362
00:32:20,593 --> 00:32:23,505
I said shame on you,
John.

363
00:32:23,536 --> 00:32:25,969
-You meant that?
-Yes, I meant it.

364
00:32:26,001 --> 00:32:27,377
I am tired
of this game.

365
00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:29,841
And I ask to be excused
in order to resume my work.

366
00:32:29,873 --> 00:32:32,977
The baron will return in the morning,
 and he'll want his boots polished.

367
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:36,882
Stop!

368
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:42,482
I forbid you.
Put away the boots.

369
00:32:42,513 --> 00:32:45,202
It is my duty,
which I am bound to do.

370
00:32:45,233 --> 00:32:46,642
He is a good master.

371
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:49,010
And I'm not expected
to serve as your playmate.

372
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:53,650
Then shine
my shoes first.

373
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:01,522
Why, you're proud.

374
00:33:01,554 --> 00:33:04,371
In some ways,
not in others.

375
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:09,075
Pour us a drink,

376
00:33:09,107 --> 00:33:11,859
a strong one,
a Midsummer Night one.

377
00:33:11,891 --> 00:33:15,027
I will empty the glass
in one swallow.

378
00:33:30,835 --> 00:33:33,107
Thank you, John.
How nice of you.

379
00:33:49,876 --> 00:33:52,372
Have you ever been
in love?

380
00:33:53,556 --> 00:33:56,244
We don't use
that word.

381
00:33:56,276 --> 00:33:59,253
But I have liked
a lot of girls.

382
00:33:59,284 --> 00:34:01,556
And once when I could not
have one girl I wanted,

383
00:34:01,588 --> 00:34:04,405
I became sick,
horribly sick,

384
00:34:04,436 --> 00:34:06,773
sick like a prince
in a fairy tale,

385
00:34:06,804 --> 00:34:08,693
a prince who cannot
eat or drink

386
00:34:08,724 --> 00:34:10,613
because of love.

387
00:34:10,644 --> 00:34:12,981
Who was it?

388
00:34:14,004 --> 00:34:16,821
It was you.

389
00:34:22,388 --> 00:34:25,397
Do you know what the world
looks like from my place?

390
00:34:25,428 --> 00:34:27,733
No, you don't.
Your lot are like hawks.

391
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:30,133
You're like falcons,
always floating about high in the sky.

392
00:34:30,164 --> 00:34:32,053
And their backs
are rarely seen,

393
00:34:32,084 --> 00:34:33,973
'cause they just
glide along,

394
00:34:34,004 --> 00:34:35,861
right up there.

395
00:34:48,437 --> 00:34:50,294
Come.

396
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,086
Come with me.

397
00:35:32,759 --> 00:35:34,647
See?

398
00:35:38,839 --> 00:35:41,080
It's as if you have
your own secret world.

399
00:36:06,136 --> 00:36:08,120
Tell me
about your home.

400
00:36:09,912 --> 00:36:12,984
It must be a boundless
misfortune to be poor.

401
00:36:14,392 --> 00:36:17,849
Oh, Miss Julie,

402
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,560
a dog can lie
on a countess's sofa.

403
00:36:21,592 --> 00:36:23,609
A horse may have
its muzzle stroked

404
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:25,529
by a young lady's hand.

405
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:28,889
But a servant boy--

406
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,905
Ah, well.

407
00:36:34,937 --> 00:36:38,489
My home--

408
00:36:38,521 --> 00:36:40,825
it is a shack

409
00:36:40,857 --> 00:36:43,545
far out there
in the gray wasteland

410
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:47,417
where there isn't even
a single tree.

411
00:36:47,449 --> 00:36:50,969
And you can't see it
from here even if you climb to the top.

412
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:52,154
It's hidden.

413
00:36:52,185 --> 00:36:56,506
Sometimes, as a boy,

414
00:36:56,538 --> 00:37:00,409
I was drawn to see
your castle,

415
00:37:00,441 --> 00:37:02,425
your gardens.

416
00:37:02,457 --> 00:37:04,922
And when I came
close enough, I could see

417
00:37:04,954 --> 00:37:07,642
the wall
around your park.

418
00:37:07,673 --> 00:37:09,946
In the evenings I would
creep to the wall

419
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:12,538
and climb up
to see your home--

420
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:16,059
oh, far more magnificent
than the church.

421
00:37:17,978 --> 00:37:20,955
I had never been
inside of it, never,

422
00:37:20,986 --> 00:37:23,450
but no matter
where my thoughts went later in life,

423
00:37:23,482 --> 00:37:26,619
they would return always
to that place--

424
00:37:26,651 --> 00:37:28,539
me sitting
on the wall,

425
00:37:28,571 --> 00:37:30,459
shaded by trees

426
00:37:30,491 --> 00:37:32,379
and covered
by honeysuckle,

427
00:37:32,411 --> 00:37:34,299
watching the people
coming and going,

428
00:37:34,331 --> 00:37:38,491
like they were kings
and emperors,

429
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:41,627
and I knew

430
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:43,931
that world
would never be mine.

431
00:37:47,035 --> 00:37:49,339
And then

432
00:37:49,371 --> 00:37:52,188
one day

433
00:37:52,219 --> 00:37:56,091
I caught sight
of a pink dress

434
00:37:56,123 --> 00:37:58,908
and a pair
of white stockings.

435
00:37:59,963 --> 00:38:02,428
I saw you

436
00:38:02,459 --> 00:38:05,116
walking among the roses.

437
00:38:05,148 --> 00:38:08,220
Yes.

438
00:38:08,251 --> 00:38:11,132
I fell in love.

439
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:13,052
Oh, I wanted
to talk to you.

440
00:38:13,084 --> 00:38:16,636
I-- I wanted to...

441
00:38:16,668 --> 00:38:19,069
touch you.

442
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,972
And I thought,
if it is true

443
00:38:23,004 --> 00:38:26,044
that a robber can enter the Kingdom
 of Heaven and be with the angels,

444
00:38:26,076 --> 00:38:29,117
then why can't
a peasant like me

445
00:38:29,148 --> 00:38:31,293
be in the baron's
garden

446
00:38:31,325 --> 00:38:35,133
and just play
with his daughter?

447
00:38:37,533 --> 00:38:40,541
The next Sunday,
I washed myself with soap and hot water

448
00:38:40,573 --> 00:38:42,461
and put on
my best clothes

449
00:38:42,493 --> 00:38:45,213
and went to church,
where I could see you again.

450
00:38:45,245 --> 00:38:46,589
I did see you.

451
00:38:46,621 --> 00:38:49,917
Yes, Miss Julie,
I did see you

452
00:38:49,949 --> 00:38:53,245
and went home
determined to die.

453
00:38:53,277 --> 00:38:55,294
But I wanted to die
beautifully

454
00:38:55,325 --> 00:38:57,214
and peacefully,

455
00:38:57,245 --> 00:39:00,638
without any pain.

456
00:39:00,669 --> 00:39:02,781
And then I recalled
that it was deadly

457
00:39:02,813 --> 00:39:05,502
to sleep
under an elder bush.

458
00:39:05,534 --> 00:39:07,422
And I knew
of a big one,

459
00:39:07,454 --> 00:39:10,174
in full bloom.

460
00:39:10,205 --> 00:39:13,150
I picked
all of its flowers

461
00:39:13,181 --> 00:39:16,158
and made a bed
in the big box where we keep the oats.

462
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,078
I laid down

463
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:22,046
and pulled the lid down
over myself,

464
00:39:22,078 --> 00:39:24,799
closed my eyes.

465
00:39:26,526 --> 00:39:29,695
I fell asleep
on the poisonous elders

466
00:39:29,726 --> 00:39:34,047
and I woke up
a very sick boy.

467
00:39:34,078 --> 00:39:36,894
But I didn't die,

468
00:39:36,926 --> 00:39:38,975
as you can see.

469
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:43,967
And I knew that I could
never have you.

470
00:39:46,974 --> 00:39:49,632
You're everything
I can never have.

471
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:02,879
You speak like--

472
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:08,800
like what I find
in my books.

473
00:40:10,175 --> 00:40:12,671
Did you ever go
to school?

474
00:40:12,703 --> 00:40:16,320
Not much, no,
but I have read a lot

475
00:40:16,351 --> 00:40:18,336
and gone
to the theatre

476
00:40:18,367 --> 00:40:20,256
and have listened
to the conversation

477
00:40:20,287 --> 00:40:22,336
of better-class people.

478
00:40:22,368 --> 00:40:24,608
I even try to speak
like them.

479
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,105
You stand around and listen
to what we're saying?

480
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:29,025
Oh, yes.

481
00:40:29,056 --> 00:40:30,945
And I have heard
a lot

482
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,992
when I was driving
the carriage for you, Miss Julie,

483
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,168
or rowing the boat for you--
you and your girlfriend.

484
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,545
What?
Tell me.

485
00:40:36,576 --> 00:40:38,657
It wouldn't be easy
to repeat.

486
00:40:38,688 --> 00:40:40,577
I was surprised.

487
00:40:40,608 --> 00:40:42,497
I couldn't understand
where you, Miss Julie,

488
00:40:42,528 --> 00:40:44,993
had learned such words.

489
00:40:47,233 --> 00:40:49,952
I--

490
00:40:49,984 --> 00:40:52,673
Perhaps there isn't
quite as much difference as they think

491
00:40:52,705 --> 00:40:54,754
between human beings
and human beings.

492
00:43:37,893 --> 00:43:40,934
May I ask permission
to go to bed?

493
00:43:40,965 --> 00:43:42,726
Go to bed?

494
00:43:42,758 --> 00:43:44,294
On Midsummer's Night?
You said--

495
00:43:44,326 --> 00:43:46,822
Dancing with the mob
out there

496
00:43:46,854 --> 00:43:49,063
has no attraction
for me.

497
00:43:52,422 --> 00:43:54,631
Good night, Miss Julie.
Sleep well.

498
00:43:56,775 --> 00:43:58,663
Get the boat

499
00:43:58,695 --> 00:44:00,583
and take me out
on the lake.

500
00:44:00,615 --> 00:44:03,176
I want to watch
the sun.

501
00:44:18,215 --> 00:44:20,232
Would that be wise?

502
00:44:20,263 --> 00:44:21,992
Are you afraid
of your reputation?

503
00:44:22,023 --> 00:44:23,527
I don't want
to be made ridiculous.

504
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:26,119
And I don't want
to be discharged with no recommendation.

505
00:44:26,151 --> 00:44:27,816
Maybe I even owe
Kathleen something.

506
00:44:27,848 --> 00:44:29,703
Oh, you're afraid
of Kathleen?

507
00:44:29,735 --> 00:44:32,232
-Take my advice and go to bed.
-Are you ordering me now?

508
00:44:32,263 --> 00:44:34,920
Yes, for once,
and for your own sake.

509
00:44:34,951 --> 00:44:36,967
The night is far gone.

510
00:44:36,999 --> 00:44:39,464
You've been drinking.
You don't know what you're doing.

511
00:44:44,712 --> 00:44:47,912
I hear the crowd
coming this way to look for me.

512
00:44:49,192 --> 00:44:51,080
I can't be found
here with you.

513
00:44:51,112 --> 00:44:54,601
I love the people,
and they like me.

514
00:44:54,633 --> 00:44:56,584
Let them come,
and you'll see.

515
00:44:56,616 --> 00:44:59,593
No, Miss Julie, they don't like you.
They--

516
00:44:59,624 --> 00:45:02,409
they take your food and your money
and spit at your back.

517
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,712
Why?
I never hurt them.

518
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:07,113
The mob is always
cowardly.

519
00:45:07,145 --> 00:45:09,097
They are
false-hearted.

520
00:45:11,049 --> 00:45:13,833
In such a situation
there's nothing to do but run away.

521
00:45:13,865 --> 00:45:15,945
-Let us run away.
-Run away where? To my room?

522
00:45:15,977 --> 00:45:17,994
No, no, Miss Julie,
to mine.

523
00:45:18,025 --> 00:45:21,513
We'll be safe there.
I'll look after you. Trust me, I will.

524
00:45:21,545 --> 00:45:23,465
-If they will look for you in there?
-I'll bolt the door.

525
00:45:23,497 --> 00:45:25,385
And if they try
to break it down?

526
00:45:25,417 --> 00:45:26,857
I'll shoot.

527
00:45:26,889 --> 00:45:29,354
Come.
Come.

528
00:45:29,385 --> 00:45:32,394
-Do you promise me that--? Promise--
-I promise.

529
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:09,806
Man: Kathleen!
Open the door, Kathleen!

530
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:12,143
-Woman: Kathleen?
-Man: Will you open it?

531
00:48:28,847 --> 00:48:30,831
I don't know
who I am.

532
00:48:34,863 --> 00:48:36,720
I don't know
who you are.

533
00:48:39,535 --> 00:48:41,391
I don't either.

534
00:48:44,271 --> 00:48:47,183
You don't know
who I am?

535
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:49,200
Did you say that?

536
00:48:49,232 --> 00:48:51,824
No.

537
00:48:51,856 --> 00:48:53,713
No what?

538
00:48:59,151 --> 00:49:01,360
Come over here.

539
00:49:46,545 --> 00:49:48,626
Your hand in mine.

540
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,994
I did not tell you,

541
00:49:59,025 --> 00:50:03,090
that time I saw you
in the garden,

542
00:50:03,121 --> 00:50:05,234
I sat for hours
on the wall,

543
00:50:05,266 --> 00:50:09,202
just looking at the house
until the sun set.

544
00:50:09,234 --> 00:50:11,122
And then I--

545
00:50:11,154 --> 00:50:13,042
you may
despise me now,

546
00:50:13,074 --> 00:50:17,394
but I did what I never
had dared to do before.

547
00:50:17,426 --> 00:50:21,139
I jumped down
on the other side,

548
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:25,395
hoping you'd come out again
so that I could speak to you.

549
00:50:25,427 --> 00:50:28,242
I don't know
what I was thinking.

550
00:50:28,274 --> 00:50:30,771
I knew that
I didn't belong.

551
00:50:30,802 --> 00:50:33,875
I was very scared,
Miss Julie.

552
00:50:33,907 --> 00:50:37,075
I knew who I was--

553
00:50:37,107 --> 00:50:40,403
a boy who found his brother
starved to death in the bed beside him,

554
00:50:40,435 --> 00:50:42,323
and my father
telling me

555
00:50:42,355 --> 00:50:44,244
to never upset
His Lordship,

556
00:50:44,275 --> 00:50:46,932
how good the baron
had been to us.

557
00:50:50,291 --> 00:50:52,084
I knew I had to get out
of your garden.

558
00:50:52,116 --> 00:50:54,772
It was forbidden to me
and I would upset my father.

559
00:50:57,043 --> 00:50:59,381
And then I saw
someone coming.

560
00:51:01,139 --> 00:51:03,540
It was the baron.

561
00:51:06,292 --> 00:51:09,556
My heart
was hammering.

562
00:51:14,036 --> 00:51:15,316
I ran like mad
afterwards,

563
00:51:15,348 --> 00:51:17,268
plunging through
the raspberry bushes,

564
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,573
thorns tearing at me.
You can't imagine what it was like,

565
00:51:19,604 --> 00:51:21,589
with the thistles
that stung my feet.

566
00:51:23,541 --> 00:51:25,845
A week later
I saw you again...

567
00:51:28,724 --> 00:51:32,149
walking among
the roses

568
00:51:32,181 --> 00:51:35,349
in such
deep thought

569
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:37,877
and looking
so lonely,

570
00:51:37,908 --> 00:51:39,765
even unhappy.

571
00:51:44,116 --> 00:51:46,037
You did not see me.

572
00:51:49,429 --> 00:51:51,894
Oh, I wish you had.

573
00:53:31,192 --> 00:53:33,209
John:
Please.

574
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,192
I beg you.

575
00:53:35,224 --> 00:53:38,905
I am sorry.
I am sorry.

576
00:53:41,433 --> 00:53:44,185
You don't understand.

577
00:53:45,977 --> 00:53:47,993
I am sorry.

578
00:53:48,025 --> 00:53:50,041
Forgive me.

579
00:54:23,354 --> 00:54:26,106
I cannot stay here
any longer.

580
00:54:37,371 --> 00:54:40,378
Please stay in the room
until I make sure

581
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:42,747
Kathleen won't see you.

582
00:55:21,564 --> 00:55:23,581
Kathleen, please.

583
00:55:29,723 --> 00:55:32,509
Please, Kathleen.

584
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:35,293
Please stay here

585
00:55:35,324 --> 00:55:37,980
just for a little while.

586
00:55:38,012 --> 00:55:39,516
Please stay in here.

587
00:55:39,548 --> 00:55:43,549
There are things I--
I can't control now.

588
00:55:45,756 --> 00:55:47,965
I can't control her--
Miss Julie.

589
00:55:47,997 --> 00:55:49,053
Don't.

590
00:55:49,084 --> 00:55:51,005
Don't talk, shh.
Wait.

591
00:55:51,037 --> 00:55:53,277
I will talk.

592
00:55:53,309 --> 00:55:55,485
I'll come back.
I will.

593
00:55:59,165 --> 00:56:01,277
Stay in here now,
Kathleen,

594
00:56:01,308 --> 00:56:03,902
for me, for us.

595
00:56:07,165 --> 00:56:09,533
Try to sleep.

596
00:56:09,565 --> 00:56:12,126
Please, you--
you need sleep.

597
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:33,056
Kathleen may have
heard us.

598
00:57:33,088 --> 00:57:35,105
I think she knows.

599
00:57:36,928 --> 00:57:40,128
What shall we do?

600
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,721
John, what are we
to do?

601
00:57:42,752 --> 00:57:44,833
We?

602
00:57:47,712 --> 00:57:49,441
We.

603
00:58:05,889 --> 00:58:08,577
We've been doing
what everyone is doing.

604
00:58:08,609 --> 00:58:11,426
It is Midsummer Night,
Miss Julie.

605
00:58:11,457 --> 00:58:13,346
Between midnight and dawn
lovers are allowed

606
00:58:13,377 --> 00:58:15,841
to open their hearts
and their loins.

607
00:58:15,873 --> 00:58:17,793
Listen, we--

608
00:58:17,825 --> 00:58:19,810
we could run away,

609
00:58:19,841 --> 00:58:22,178
travel far away
from here.

610
00:58:24,321 --> 00:58:25,410
Leave?

611
00:58:25,441 --> 00:58:27,457
Far away.
To Switzerland,

612
00:58:27,489 --> 00:58:29,954
the Italian lakes,
Lake Como.

613
00:58:29,986 --> 00:58:32,193
I've been there.
I even told you earlier.

614
00:58:32,225 --> 00:58:35,714
Life has given us an answer.
It's a miracle.

615
00:58:35,746 --> 00:58:37,730
I even have a picture
over here.

616
00:58:37,762 --> 00:58:40,322
Look.

617
00:58:40,354 --> 00:58:42,242
That's the life--

618
00:58:42,274 --> 00:58:44,163
always new faces,

619
00:58:44,194 --> 00:58:46,691
never a moment to spare
for worry and nerves,

620
00:58:46,722 --> 00:58:49,059
no need to wonder
what to do with yourself,

621
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:51,202
people dancing
night and day,

622
00:58:51,234 --> 00:58:53,122
trains whistling,

623
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:55,138
and all the time
the jingle of gold coins.

624
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:57,699
That's the life, Julie.
Oh, eternal summer,

625
00:58:57,731 --> 00:58:59,875
orange trees,
laurels.

626
00:58:59,907 --> 00:59:02,627
I'll start a hotel,
everything first-class.

627
00:59:02,658 --> 00:59:04,675
- I'll have first-class customers.
- A hotel?

628
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:06,723
Yes!
That'll be our life.

629
00:59:06,754 --> 00:59:09,155
You will be
the pride of the place,

630
00:59:09,187 --> 00:59:11,075
what with your looks
and your style,

631
00:59:11,107 --> 00:59:13,091
why, it's a sure thing.

632
00:59:13,123 --> 00:59:14,499
I'm telling you,

633
00:59:14,531 --> 00:59:16,899
you will never be
lonely again.

634
00:59:16,931 --> 00:59:19,588
I'll take care of you.
I promise.

635
00:59:19,619 --> 00:59:22,787
Freedom, no more walls
and no gardens.

636
00:59:22,819 --> 00:59:25,380
And you'll sit there
like a queen.

637
00:59:25,411 --> 00:59:27,587
You'll keep the slaves going
by the touch of the bell.

638
00:59:27,619 --> 00:59:29,507
And the guests will file
past your throne,

639
00:59:29,539 --> 00:59:31,427
timidly leaving
their offerings.

640
00:59:31,459 --> 00:59:33,699
And you cannot imagine
how the people will tremble

641
00:59:33,731 --> 00:59:35,363
when they're
holding out a bill,

642
00:59:35,395 --> 00:59:38,148
and you just sweeten them
with your pretty smile.

643
00:59:38,179 --> 00:59:40,388
And one day

644
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:42,308
I will be as rich
as your father.

645
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:44,197
I may even
buy him out.

646
00:59:50,404 --> 00:59:53,412
Tell me you love me.
Otherwise I am nothing.

647
00:59:53,444 --> 00:59:55,716
Not now, not here.
And above all, it's important--

648
00:59:55,748 --> 00:59:58,308
no feelings.
Then everything will be lost.

649
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:00,420
Cold blood, clear heads,
grown-up people.

650
01:00:00,452 --> 01:00:03,365
Let us sit at the table,
you there.

651
01:00:10,052 --> 01:00:12,644
And I'll sit here.
And we'll just talk amongst ourselves

652
01:00:12,676 --> 01:00:15,333
as if nothing's happened between us,
making our plans.

653
01:00:15,364 --> 01:00:18,725
Have you no feelings
at all?

654
01:00:18,757 --> 01:00:22,053
I?  No one is more full of feeling
than I am.

655
01:00:22,085 --> 01:00:26,022
A while ago you held me.
I-- I was in your bed.

656
01:00:26,053 --> 01:00:28,325
Yes, that was then.
Now we have other things to think about.

657
01:00:28,357 --> 01:00:30,245
Don't speak harshly
to me!

658
01:00:30,277 --> 01:00:32,294
We have made
one mistake,

659
01:00:32,326 --> 01:00:34,214
a big one.

660
01:00:34,246 --> 01:00:36,966
There's no sense
in making another.

661
01:00:36,997 --> 01:00:39,398
Now the baron may be back
at any moment,

662
01:00:39,429 --> 01:00:41,382
but before he comes,
I need to know--

663
01:00:41,414 --> 01:00:42,854
do you believe
in me?

664
01:00:44,261 --> 01:00:46,502
How can we do
all this?

665
01:00:46,533 --> 01:00:48,390
We have no money.

666
01:00:49,446 --> 01:00:51,719
True enough.

667
01:00:53,957 --> 01:00:57,222
I want you to be
my partner.

668
01:00:57,254 --> 01:00:59,142
I'll need
your money.

669
01:00:59,174 --> 01:01:01,543
I have no money,
not of my own.

670
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:03,655
I have nothing myself.

671
01:01:03,686 --> 01:01:05,639
That's it then.

672
01:01:10,598 --> 01:01:14,055
You think I'm going to
stay in this house

673
01:01:14,086 --> 01:01:17,031
as your woman?

674
01:01:17,062 --> 01:01:19,079
Do you think
I'll let people

675
01:01:19,111 --> 01:01:21,831
point their fingers at me,
laughing at me?

676
01:01:21,863 --> 01:01:24,839
Do you think I can ever
look my father in the face after this?

677
01:01:24,871 --> 01:01:28,455
- Oh, what have I done?
- Don't try that one.

678
01:01:28,487 --> 01:01:29,927
Turn off
that fountain!

679
01:01:29,959 --> 01:01:32,264
Do you even know
what love is?

680
01:01:32,295 --> 01:01:33,672
Me?

681
01:01:33,703 --> 01:01:35,304
I should say so!

682
01:01:35,336 --> 01:01:37,064
Do you think this is
my first time?

683
01:01:37,095 --> 01:01:39,240
Oh, now you
despise me.

684
01:01:39,272 --> 01:01:40,967
Don't pretend
you're nervous

685
01:01:40,999 --> 01:01:43,048
and don't pretend
you're special.

686
01:01:44,328 --> 01:01:46,696
We are the same now.

687
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:02,185
Look here,
my little one.

688
01:02:02,216 --> 01:02:04,105
Let me treat you
to a glass

689
01:02:04,136 --> 01:02:06,601
of something
super fine.

690
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:18,185
Where did you
get this?

691
01:02:18,217 --> 01:02:20,425
In the cellar.

692
01:02:20,457 --> 01:02:22,057
My father's wine.

693
01:02:22,088 --> 01:02:26,153
Well, isn't it good enough
for his son-in-law?

694
01:02:26,185 --> 01:02:28,233
Thief.

695
01:02:28,265 --> 01:02:30,345
You going to tell
on me?

696
01:02:30,377 --> 01:02:32,233
Yes, to the fools.

697
01:02:35,849 --> 01:02:37,737
I'm so unhappy.

698
01:02:37,769 --> 01:02:40,393
Why?
Think of Kathleen.

699
01:02:40,425 --> 01:02:42,665
I even had to forbid her
to come to the kitchen now.

700
01:02:42,697 --> 01:02:45,322
-Don't you think she has feelings?
-A servant is a servant.

701
01:02:45,353 --> 01:02:47,594
And a whore
is a whore!

702
01:02:47,626 --> 01:02:50,410
Oh my God,
I'm so scared.

703
01:02:50,441 --> 01:02:54,218
I'm in a dark hole
and it's like I'm sinking.

704
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:56,138
I'm sinking.

705
01:03:02,666 --> 01:03:06,155
You are sick,
young lady.

706
01:03:06,186 --> 01:03:08,779
I do feel sorry
for you.

707
01:03:10,506 --> 01:03:12,971
When I was
a little boy,

708
01:03:13,003 --> 01:03:15,435
lying there in secret,
looking at you in the garden

709
01:03:15,466 --> 01:03:17,451
and saw you walking
among the roses

710
01:03:17,482 --> 01:03:19,723
and saw your
slim white ankles,

711
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:21,707
well, I tell you now,

712
01:03:21,739 --> 01:03:24,715
I had the same nasty thoughts
like all young boys.

713
01:03:24,746 --> 01:03:26,987
You said you wanted
to die for me.

714
01:03:27,018 --> 01:03:28,523
It was a lie.

715
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:30,379
I had to think
of something.

716
01:03:30,411 --> 01:03:33,099
It's the fancy talk
that makes women open their legs.

717
01:03:33,131 --> 01:03:35,979
-Bastard!
-Make sure you don't carry one.

718
01:03:36,011 --> 01:03:38,284
-So now you've seen the hawk's back.
-Not exactly its back.

719
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:41,164
-Oh, how can a human soul be so filthy?
-Wash it off then.

720
01:03:41,195 --> 01:03:44,140
You minion!
Stand up when I speak to you!

721
01:03:44,171 --> 01:03:46,156
Stand up
when I speak to you!

722
01:03:46,187 --> 01:03:49,036
Minion?
Shut your mouth, lady whore!

723
01:03:49,067 --> 01:03:51,564
Shut up and get out of here!
Telling me I am a minion!

724
01:03:51,596 --> 01:03:54,252
You have no right to be in here!
You're not needed!

725
01:03:54,284 --> 01:03:56,172
Kathleen doesn't like
your kind

726
01:03:56,204 --> 01:03:58,348
visiting her kitchen,
especially you.

727
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:00,620
Do you think she would be
so vulgar as you were this evening,

728
01:04:00,652 --> 01:04:03,020
-throwing yourself on a man the way you did?
-No more.

729
01:04:03,052 --> 01:04:06,124
Where do you think you are?
In a zoo?  In a whorehouse?

730
01:04:06,156 --> 01:04:07,693
No more.

731
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:11,852
Yes, I'm dirt.
I'm nothing.

732
01:04:11,884 --> 01:04:13,932
I don't belong.
I know.

733
01:04:13,964 --> 01:04:17,420
But please,
please help me, John.

734
01:04:17,452 --> 01:04:21,741
I need to find
a way out of this.

735
01:04:21,773 --> 01:04:23,661
Please help me.

736
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:26,189
Help me find a way
out of this.

737
01:04:26,221 --> 01:04:28,109
I may be
partly to blame,

738
01:04:28,141 --> 01:04:30,029
but do you think
someone in my position

739
01:04:30,061 --> 01:04:31,949
would dare even to look
at someone like you

740
01:04:31,981 --> 01:04:33,869
if you hadn't asked for it,
begged for it?

741
01:04:33,901 --> 01:04:35,213
Please.

742
01:04:35,245 --> 01:04:37,133
I'm still amazed.

743
01:04:37,165 --> 01:04:39,405
Though I must say
the victory

744
01:04:39,437 --> 01:04:41,325
was far too easy
to be really exciting.

745
01:04:41,357 --> 01:04:42,797
Oh, no more.

746
01:04:42,829 --> 01:04:44,366
I'm sorry
I said that.

747
01:04:44,397 --> 01:04:46,542
I don't want to strike
one who is unarmed.

748
01:04:49,133 --> 01:04:51,821
Oh, I cannot deny

749
01:04:51,853 --> 01:04:53,837
that it has given me
pleasure

750
01:04:53,869 --> 01:04:57,773
to discover that what has
dazzled us below you

751
01:04:57,805 --> 01:05:00,558
was only gaudiness,

752
01:05:00,589 --> 01:05:03,950
that there is powder
under tender cheek,

753
01:05:03,981 --> 01:05:07,150
that there is grime
under your dirty nails,

754
01:05:07,182 --> 01:05:10,478
that your perfumed handkerchief
is dirty, Julie.

755
01:05:12,398 --> 01:05:14,287
Oh, it hurts me
to realize

756
01:05:14,318 --> 01:05:17,710
that what I yearned to reach
is so far from genuine.

757
01:05:17,742 --> 01:05:19,726
It's nothing.
It's worthless.

758
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:25,743
I'm sorry you've sunk
so low, Julie,

759
01:05:25,774 --> 01:05:28,239
far lower than
your own cook.

760
01:05:33,775 --> 01:05:37,071
It hurts like

761
01:05:37,103 --> 01:05:38,991
watching the last flowers
of autumn

762
01:05:39,023 --> 01:05:42,191
hanging their heads,
already faded

763
01:05:42,222 --> 01:05:44,111
or torn to shreds
by the rain

764
01:05:44,142 --> 01:05:46,095
and turned
into muck.

765
01:05:47,663 --> 01:05:51,599
You talk as if you are
already above me.

766
01:05:51,631 --> 01:05:53,359
I am bred
by a baron.

767
01:05:53,391 --> 01:05:54,735
You can never
achieve that.

768
01:05:54,767 --> 01:05:57,455
Aye, that's true.

769
01:05:57,487 --> 01:06:01,072
But I can provide a baron,
with your help.

770
01:06:01,104 --> 01:06:03,824
You're a thief.
I'm not.

771
01:06:03,855 --> 01:06:07,184
There are worse things
than being a thief, much worse.

772
01:06:07,216 --> 01:06:09,584
Anyway, think about it:

773
01:06:09,615 --> 01:06:11,504
I am serving
in a household

774
01:06:11,535 --> 01:06:13,424
and I look upon myself
as one of the family,

775
01:06:13,456 --> 01:06:15,344
as a child
of the house.

776
01:06:15,376 --> 01:06:17,649
And it isn't regarded as stealing
if a child picks a berry

777
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,569
from a large bunch.

778
01:06:28,145 --> 01:06:30,673
Shh, shh, Miss Julie.

779
01:06:35,184 --> 01:06:37,521
Miss Julie.

780
01:06:37,552 --> 01:06:39,441
Shh.

781
01:06:39,472 --> 01:06:41,361
Miss Julie, you are
a wonderful woman,

782
01:06:41,392 --> 01:06:43,441
and you're far too good
for one like me.

783
01:06:43,473 --> 01:06:45,713
You've been drinking.
You lost your head.

784
01:06:45,745 --> 01:06:47,633
And now you're trying
to cover up your mistake

785
01:06:47,665 --> 01:06:49,905
by telling yourself that you love me.
Well, you don't.

786
01:06:49,937 --> 01:06:51,346
Unless my looks
may have tempted you.

787
01:06:51,377 --> 01:06:52,977
And maybe there was
a physical attraction.

788
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:55,057
But that makes your love
no better than mine.

789
01:06:55,089 --> 01:06:57,233
I could be your pet,
like your dog

790
01:06:57,265 --> 01:06:59,922
that you give affection when it suits you,
 but that's not enough for me.

791
01:06:59,953 --> 01:07:01,714
I can never make you
love me.

792
01:07:01,746 --> 01:07:03,858
Are you so sure?

793
01:07:09,202 --> 01:07:12,083
Are you meaning to say
that it might be possible?

794
01:07:14,193 --> 01:07:16,754
Oh.

795
01:07:16,786 --> 01:07:19,634
And that I could
fall in love with you?

796
01:07:20,978 --> 01:07:22,835
Oh.

797
01:07:24,018 --> 01:07:25,490
Oh, aye.

798
01:07:27,026 --> 01:07:28,883
Well...

799
01:07:31,251 --> 01:07:33,107
Aye.

800
01:07:34,739 --> 01:07:37,235
Yes, I could.

801
01:07:41,778 --> 01:07:43,667
You are beautiful.

802
01:07:43,698 --> 01:07:45,587
You are refined.

803
01:07:45,618 --> 01:07:47,507
Oh, I love that
in a woman.

804
01:07:47,538 --> 01:07:49,619
You are educated.

805
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:52,915
We could read together,
all the great writers.

806
01:07:52,947 --> 01:07:55,411
We could discuss them.

807
01:07:55,443 --> 01:07:57,332
Oh, you--

808
01:07:57,363 --> 01:07:59,956
the fire you ignite in a man
isn't likely to go out.

809
01:07:59,987 --> 01:08:02,580
You are like hot spices
with one of your kisses.

810
01:08:02,611 --> 01:08:04,884
Leave me alone.

811
01:08:13,811 --> 01:08:15,860
You're disgusting,

812
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:18,868
like a rat.

813
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:21,205
I hate you.

814
01:08:25,076 --> 01:08:27,509
Run away
with me then.

815
01:08:34,132 --> 01:08:36,565
Yes, we'll run away.

816
01:09:11,446 --> 01:09:13,590
Are you my friend?

817
01:09:13,622 --> 01:09:16,310
I am at times.

818
01:09:17,973 --> 01:09:20,182
But don't rely on me.

819
01:09:20,213 --> 01:09:22,582
I need you
to understand me,

820
01:09:22,614 --> 01:09:25,367
to see me.

821
01:09:25,398 --> 01:09:27,959
Don't give me the secrets
of your life.

822
01:09:30,902 --> 01:09:33,207
You'll regret it.

823
01:09:37,271 --> 01:09:39,351
You sound
like my mother.

824
01:09:42,167 --> 01:09:45,527
Oh, she was
so beautiful.

825
01:09:46,967 --> 01:09:49,623
Look at this picture
of her.

826
01:09:59,031 --> 01:10:01,240
She didn't want
to be a mother.

827
01:10:05,335 --> 01:10:08,087
She would smile at me
but didn't mean it.

828
01:10:13,144 --> 01:10:15,447
Sometimes when I think
of her,

829
01:10:15,479 --> 01:10:19,191
my mouth smiles.

830
01:10:19,223 --> 01:10:21,336
But I do not smile
within me.

831
01:10:25,464 --> 01:10:28,088
Don't drink more.

832
01:10:28,119 --> 01:10:30,904
It's as if

833
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:33,816
I am cut off from everything
that's life.

834
01:10:36,056 --> 01:10:39,289
Inside me,

835
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:41,529
within me--
nothing.

836
01:10:43,865 --> 01:10:46,361
A black hole.

837
01:10:51,448 --> 01:10:55,001
She taught me

838
01:10:55,033 --> 01:10:57,817
to mistrust
and to hate

839
01:10:57,849 --> 01:11:00,122
all men.

840
01:11:02,393 --> 01:11:06,361
And I promised her--
this little girl of 10--

841
01:11:06,393 --> 01:11:08,282
that I would never,

842
01:11:08,313 --> 01:11:12,665
never be a slave

843
01:11:12,697 --> 01:11:14,970
to any man.

844
01:11:19,386 --> 01:11:21,818
I didn't even understand
what it meant.

845
01:11:25,977 --> 01:11:28,474
Then you hate me too.

846
01:11:28,505 --> 01:11:30,554
Yes.

847
01:11:35,322 --> 01:11:38,555
I'd like to shoot you
like a dog.

848
01:11:41,146 --> 01:11:43,003
No qualms?

849
01:11:47,483 --> 01:11:50,459
No qualms.

850
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:53,755
But you have nothing
to shoot me with.

851
01:11:55,322 --> 01:11:57,467
And I'm no dog.

852
01:11:57,498 --> 01:12:00,507
I'll take you up
to my room...

853
01:12:03,098 --> 01:12:05,852
and then I'll put you
in my birdcage.

854
01:12:15,899 --> 01:12:18,331
Most of all,
I'd like to die.

855
01:12:18,363 --> 01:12:20,251
Die?

856
01:12:20,283 --> 01:12:22,460
How silly.

857
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:28,283
On the shores
of Lake Como,

858
01:12:28,315 --> 01:12:31,069
you said,
the sun always shines.

859
01:12:32,956 --> 01:12:34,813
Look at the wall
out there.

860
01:12:42,811 --> 01:12:46,461
It's all you can see
from down here.

861
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:51,965
You can only feel
the light of the sun.

862
01:12:55,389 --> 01:12:58,685
And you can only hear
the wind.

863
01:13:04,733 --> 01:13:07,869
On the other side
of that wall,

864
01:13:07,901 --> 01:13:11,677
I have a place,

865
01:13:11,709 --> 01:13:13,885
a secret garden.

866
01:13:15,805 --> 01:13:18,654
There's no wind there.

867
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:27,006
I go there
when I'm anxious.

868
01:13:30,558 --> 01:13:32,670
I'm anxious
all the time.

869
01:13:34,301 --> 01:13:37,598
I'm always longing
for some other place.

870
01:13:42,430 --> 01:13:44,766
You cannot imagine
how different

871
01:13:44,798 --> 01:13:47,103
I wanted
my life to be.

872
01:13:49,918 --> 01:13:52,959
When I was little,

873
01:13:52,990 --> 01:13:57,343
just after Mama died,

874
01:13:57,374 --> 01:14:00,287
I was hoping that

875
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:03,807
all of my garden

876
01:14:03,838 --> 01:14:07,743
would be
full of animals.

877
01:14:07,774 --> 01:14:10,208
They'd come from--

878
01:14:13,023 --> 01:14:16,575
I don't know where
they'd come from.

879
01:14:16,607 --> 01:14:20,511
They'd be there

880
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:23,392
to keep watch
over me.

881
01:14:30,176 --> 01:14:33,568
I have a pit
in my stomach.

882
01:14:35,103 --> 01:14:38,496
I do not know where
my sorrow comes from.

883
01:14:40,992 --> 01:14:44,672
And now you.

884
01:14:44,704 --> 01:14:48,384
You and me--

885
01:14:48,416 --> 01:14:51,360
yes, we must leave.

886
01:14:54,464 --> 01:14:58,144
To make life hell
for each other?

887
01:14:58,176 --> 01:15:00,417
No.

888
01:15:00,449 --> 01:15:02,848
To be happy,

889
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:06,625
smile on the inside.

890
01:15:06,657 --> 01:15:09,377
Enjoy ourselves
a few years,

891
01:15:09,408 --> 01:15:12,513
as long as we can.

892
01:15:12,544 --> 01:15:15,105
And then...

893
01:15:17,024 --> 01:15:19,297
to die.

894
01:15:21,633 --> 01:15:23,681
Would you die
with me?

895
01:15:23,713 --> 01:15:26,977
I won't die at all.

896
01:15:27,009 --> 01:15:28,930
I enjoy life.

897
01:15:30,817 --> 01:15:33,058
You refuse
to die with me?

898
01:15:33,090 --> 01:15:34,978
I'm sorry,
Miss Julie.

899
01:15:35,010 --> 01:15:37,186
I'll talk no more.
I'm going to bed.

900
01:15:37,217 --> 01:15:40,322
You-- you dishonored me.
You owe me something.

901
01:15:51,618 --> 01:15:53,634
There.

902
01:15:53,665 --> 01:15:55,587
Thank you.

903
01:15:55,618 --> 01:15:58,530
This is what I get
for opening my heart to you,

904
01:15:58,562 --> 01:16:00,930
for giving away
my family honor?

905
01:16:00,962 --> 01:16:02,434
I told you
not to.

906
01:16:02,466 --> 01:16:04,227
You-- you forced me.

907
01:16:04,258 --> 01:16:06,306
You were
the seducer.

908
01:16:06,338 --> 01:16:09,250
We can get--
we can get married.

909
01:16:09,282 --> 01:16:11,779
And then
we can divorce.

910
01:16:11,810 --> 01:16:13,379
I won't demean
myself.

911
01:16:13,411 --> 01:16:14,979
-Demean?
-Yes, demean.

912
01:16:15,011 --> 01:16:18,403
Oh, how I wish it undone.
How I wish it--

913
01:16:18,434 --> 01:16:20,771
-I told you.
-Oh, if only you loved me.

914
01:16:20,802 --> 01:16:22,691
I told you
you should not drink,

915
01:16:22,722 --> 01:16:25,219
because then you talk.
You shouldn't talk.

916
01:16:25,251 --> 01:16:28,228
A butterfly dies
in the act of love.

917
01:16:28,259 --> 01:16:30,019
I wish I did too.

918
01:16:30,051 --> 01:16:32,068
What do you want?

919
01:16:32,099 --> 01:16:34,500
Am I to cry with you again?
What--?

920
01:16:34,531 --> 01:16:36,739
Do you want me to kiss
your feet again?

921
01:16:36,771 --> 01:16:39,396
What?

922
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:41,636
I've had enough,
Miss Julie.

923
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:45,219
I--

924
01:16:45,251 --> 01:16:47,204
this is painful.

925
01:16:49,443 --> 01:16:51,908
Miss Julie,
Miss Julie,

926
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:55,972
I see that
you're unhappy.

927
01:16:56,004 --> 01:16:59,909
Yes, you are suffering,
but...

928
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:02,437
I don't understand
what you're saying.

929
01:17:02,468 --> 01:17:04,709
I mean, my people--

930
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:06,756
we don't carry on
like you do.

931
01:17:06,788 --> 01:17:09,765
We don't hate
and destroy each other.

932
01:17:09,797 --> 01:17:12,229
We make love for fun.
Yes, it is a game,

933
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:15,557
and we play it
when we get time off from work.

934
01:17:15,588 --> 01:17:18,693
But we don't have
all day and all night

935
01:17:18,725 --> 01:17:20,773
like you people do.

936
01:17:39,461 --> 01:17:42,021
You know what?

937
01:17:42,053 --> 01:17:44,070
I think you're ill.

938
01:17:44,102 --> 01:17:48,133
Yes, I'm sure
you're ill.

939
01:17:48,165 --> 01:17:51,494
Be kind to me, John.

940
01:17:51,526 --> 01:17:54,822
Talk to me
like a human being.

941
01:17:54,854 --> 01:17:58,086
Well, then be
a human being yourself.

942
01:17:58,117 --> 01:18:00,966
You think you can
spit on me,

943
01:18:00,997 --> 01:18:03,014
but won't let me
wipe it off on you?

944
01:18:03,046 --> 01:18:04,422
Help me then.

945
01:18:04,454 --> 01:18:06,855
Tell me
what I should do.

946
01:18:06,886 --> 01:18:09,222
Lord, if only
I knew that myself.

947
01:18:09,254 --> 01:18:11,815
I-- I know

948
01:18:11,846 --> 01:18:15,655
I-- I've been
acting wild,

949
01:18:15,687 --> 01:18:19,431
as-- as if I'm mad.
I know.

950
01:18:19,462 --> 01:18:21,478
But now

951
01:18:21,510 --> 01:18:25,062
what do I do?

952
01:18:25,094 --> 01:18:28,423
Stay here
and keep quiet.

953
01:18:28,455 --> 01:18:30,343
Nobody knows.

954
01:18:30,375 --> 01:18:33,607
I-- I can't stay here.
Everyone knows.

955
01:18:33,638 --> 01:18:35,527
They don't know,

956
01:18:35,559 --> 01:18:37,800
and they would never
believe it.

957
01:18:39,975 --> 01:18:43,848
But suppose
there are consequences.

958
01:18:47,463 --> 01:18:49,288
Consequences?

959
01:18:51,079 --> 01:18:52,872
Then there's only
one thing to do--

960
01:18:52,903 --> 01:18:55,783
you must disappear.
You must leave at once.

961
01:18:55,815 --> 01:18:58,504
I can't go with you.
Then they would know. You must go alone.

962
01:18:58,536 --> 01:19:00,488
Alone?

963
01:19:00,519 --> 01:19:02,632
Where?
I can't do that.

964
01:19:02,664 --> 01:19:04,936
You must, and before
the baron gets back.

965
01:19:04,967 --> 01:19:06,856
If you stay, you know
what will happen.

966
01:19:06,888 --> 01:19:08,776
Later you will write
to your father,

967
01:19:08,808 --> 01:19:10,696
tell him how unhappy you are.
He loves you.

968
01:19:10,728 --> 01:19:13,097
He will take care of it.
He'll never guess it was me.

969
01:19:13,128 --> 01:19:15,529
I don't think he'd be
anxious to find out.

970
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:19,625
-I'll go if you come with me.
-Are you stark mad?

971
01:19:19,657 --> 01:19:22,505
Miss Julie is
running away with a--

972
01:19:22,537 --> 01:19:24,744
a servant?

973
01:19:24,776 --> 01:19:27,625
It would be
in the papers.

974
01:19:27,656 --> 01:19:30,601
And, Miss Julie, the baron
will never survive.

975
01:19:30,632 --> 01:19:34,121
I'm so tired.

976
01:19:34,153 --> 01:19:38,153
I'm so tremendously tired.

977
01:19:44,809 --> 01:19:46,794
Order me.

978
01:19:51,721 --> 01:19:53,866
I must be told.

979
01:19:58,377 --> 01:20:00,875
I can no longer
think.

980
01:20:02,538 --> 01:20:04,394
I can't move.

981
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:08,682
Do you see now

982
01:20:08,714 --> 01:20:13,387
what helpless creatures
you people are?

983
01:20:13,418 --> 01:20:15,434
Why are your kind
strutting about

984
01:20:15,466 --> 01:20:17,354
with your noses
in the air,

985
01:20:17,386 --> 01:20:19,626
like you were
the lords of creation?

986
01:20:21,514 --> 01:20:24,651
Well, I'll tell you
what to do.

987
01:20:26,538 --> 01:20:29,195
I'll order you.

988
01:20:31,306 --> 01:20:34,219
Go to your
father's library.

989
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:37,419
In his drawer
there is money.

990
01:20:37,451 --> 01:20:39,307
Get the money.

991
01:20:45,835 --> 01:20:48,108
Come up with me.

992
01:20:51,243 --> 01:20:52,716
Go.

993
01:20:59,531 --> 01:21:01,004
Get up there.

994
01:21:03,819 --> 01:21:06,380
Speak kindly to me.

995
01:21:06,412 --> 01:21:08,428
Orders always sound
unkind.

996
01:21:08,459 --> 01:21:11,180
Now you know
what it feels like.

997
01:21:11,212 --> 01:21:13,069
Go.

998
01:21:45,996 --> 01:21:48,846
Am I allowed
to leave my room now?

999
01:21:54,797 --> 01:21:58,285
You look a mess.

1000
01:21:58,317 --> 01:22:00,686
May God forgive you.

1001
01:22:00,717 --> 01:22:03,726
What have you
been doing?

1002
01:22:07,437 --> 01:22:11,054
You are my woman.

1003
01:22:15,566 --> 01:22:18,670
But the night is long,
Kathleen.

1004
01:22:18,702 --> 01:22:22,222
All the wine--

1005
01:22:22,254 --> 01:22:24,143
my head
wasn't with me.

1006
01:22:24,174 --> 01:22:26,190
It was swimming.

1007
01:22:26,222 --> 01:22:29,838
I asked what you
have been doing.

1008
01:22:29,870 --> 01:22:33,551
I have such pain,
Kathleen.

1009
01:22:33,583 --> 01:22:36,911
Let us hold
around each other.

1010
01:22:36,942 --> 01:22:39,823
No.
No.

1011
01:22:53,071 --> 01:22:55,247
I have this
ready for you.

1012
01:22:57,967 --> 01:22:59,855
For church.

1013
01:22:59,887 --> 01:23:02,927
Oh, you-- you always
have my things.

1014
01:23:02,959 --> 01:23:04,879
Yes.

1015
01:23:04,911 --> 01:23:06,896
Thank you.

1016
01:23:08,336 --> 01:23:10,192
Thank you.

1017
01:23:27,088 --> 01:23:29,585
You promised me
you'd come with me this morning.

1018
01:23:29,616 --> 01:23:32,209
Oh, yes.

1019
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:34,225
I remember now.

1020
01:23:37,136 --> 01:23:40,241
And here you are
with my finery.

1021
01:23:40,273 --> 01:23:42,129
Yes.

1022
01:23:47,984 --> 01:23:50,033
Come on with it then.

1023
01:24:02,641 --> 01:24:05,458
What's the text today?

1024
01:24:05,489 --> 01:24:07,666
The beheading
of John the Baptist.

1025
01:24:07,697 --> 01:24:08,913
Ah.

1026
01:24:08,945 --> 01:24:13,522
Oh, you're--
you're choking me.

1027
01:24:13,553 --> 01:24:15,858
Oh God,
I'm so tired.

1028
01:24:15,890 --> 01:24:18,226
So tired.

1029
01:24:20,753 --> 01:24:22,994
I'm exhausted.

1030
01:24:24,401 --> 01:24:27,026
So why did you stay up
all night then?

1031
01:24:27,058 --> 01:24:28,338
Hmm?

1032
01:24:31,026 --> 01:24:33,011
Have you seen
your face?

1033
01:24:34,738 --> 01:24:36,658
Miss Julie.

1034
01:24:38,482 --> 01:24:40,467
She would never
leave me.

1035
01:24:40,498 --> 01:24:42,483
Stop it.
And she--

1036
01:24:42,514 --> 01:24:44,851
she who doesn't know
what's decent, she doesn't.

1037
01:24:44,882 --> 01:24:47,315
She talked.
She needed to talk.

1038
01:24:50,066 --> 01:24:52,371
You know
the way I am.

1039
01:24:52,402 --> 01:24:56,883
I'm always placing
a veil over people,

1040
01:24:56,915 --> 01:24:58,963
idealizing them.

1041
01:24:58,995 --> 01:25:03,091
So I never see
who they really are.

1042
01:25:03,123 --> 01:25:06,483
I did that with her--
Miss Julie--

1043
01:25:06,515 --> 01:25:11,059
and I was bound
to be disappointed.

1044
01:25:11,091 --> 01:25:14,228
We are all forced
to face ourselves

1045
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:16,948
as less than
we'd hoped to be.

1046
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:19,380
Isn't it funny
anyhow,

1047
01:25:19,412 --> 01:25:22,580
when you come
to think of it, her?

1048
01:25:22,611 --> 01:25:24,052
What is funny?

1049
01:25:28,979 --> 01:25:30,836
Everything.

1050
01:25:34,323 --> 01:25:36,565
Look at me
straight in the eye.

1051
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:44,277
Yes.

1052
01:25:46,132 --> 01:25:48,469
Is it possible?

1053
01:25:50,068 --> 01:25:52,725
Is it possible?

1054
01:26:01,685 --> 01:26:03,573
Yes.

1055
01:26:03,605 --> 01:26:05,718
It is.

1056
01:26:07,220 --> 01:26:08,917
It's awful.

1057
01:26:08,949 --> 01:26:10,710
I could scratch
your eyes out.

1058
01:26:10,741 --> 01:26:12,501
Yes, that's the way
I feel about it.

1059
01:26:12,533 --> 01:26:14,869
It's nasty.
It's simply disgusting.

1060
01:26:14,901 --> 01:26:16,789
You're angry
with her then?

1061
01:26:16,821 --> 01:26:18,902
No, I'm angry
with you!

1062
01:26:18,934 --> 01:26:21,270
It was a rotten thing
to do, really rotten.

1063
01:26:21,302 --> 01:26:23,446
Poor young woman.

1064
01:26:23,478 --> 01:26:26,198
I won't stay in a house where you can't
 have respect for your employers.

1065
01:26:26,229 --> 01:26:27,830
Are you jealous
of her?

1066
01:26:27,862 --> 01:26:29,878
No, not of her.

1067
01:26:29,909 --> 01:26:32,086
If it had been
Clara or Sophie,

1068
01:26:32,118 --> 01:26:34,070
then yes,
I would have been.

1069
01:26:34,101 --> 01:26:36,502
No, I will not work
in a house

1070
01:26:36,533 --> 01:26:38,550
where people can't
behave decently.

1071
01:26:38,582 --> 01:26:40,406
Would you?

1072
01:26:40,438 --> 01:26:43,286
You just dragged yourself
down in the dirt by doing it.

1073
01:26:43,318 --> 01:26:45,206
Get out of here!

1074
01:26:45,238 --> 01:26:49,015
-Get out!
Get out of here!

1075
01:26:49,046 --> 01:26:51,414
-Why should you respect them?
-You don't know?

1076
01:26:51,446 --> 01:26:54,838
You, who think you are such a smart fellow?
You don't know?

1077
01:26:54,870 --> 01:26:58,007
All it shows is that
they are not a bit better than we are.

1078
01:26:58,039 --> 01:27:00,151
If they are not any better than us,
then there is nothing

1079
01:27:00,182 --> 01:27:02,583
to inspire us to become
better ourselves.

1080
01:27:02,614 --> 01:27:04,663
And did you ever think
of the baron?

1081
01:27:04,695 --> 01:27:07,319
Just think of all the sorrows
he's had in his time.

1082
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:10,359
Listen, Jesus,
I won't stay here any longer

1083
01:27:10,391 --> 01:27:12,023
and have to
face him.

1084
01:27:12,055 --> 01:27:13,976
And then with someone
like you.

1085
01:27:14,007 --> 01:27:16,952
I can't imagine why she did it with
someone like you.

1086
01:27:16,983 --> 01:27:19,799
If it had at least been
with a man of her own people--

1087
01:27:19,831 --> 01:27:22,583
-if it had been with a better man.
-What are you saying?

1088
01:27:22,615 --> 01:27:24,759
She, who wanted
to give her dog poison

1089
01:27:24,791 --> 01:27:26,679
because it ran after
the gamekeeper's mongrel.

1090
01:27:26,711 --> 01:27:28,600
-What?
-Listen.

1091
01:27:28,631 --> 01:27:30,872
You're fine
for what you are,

1092
01:27:30,903 --> 01:27:32,792
but there is
a difference.

1093
01:27:32,823 --> 01:27:35,704
Class is class.

1094
01:27:35,736 --> 01:27:38,008
Well, let me
tell you,

1095
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:39,928
I won't stay here
any longer.

1096
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:41,721
On the 14th of October
we are leaving.

1097
01:27:41,752 --> 01:27:43,192
Yes, that's right.
You're coming too.

1098
01:27:43,223 --> 01:27:45,240
You can get a job
as a janitor,

1099
01:27:45,272 --> 01:27:47,192
or maybe a messenger
in some government office.

1100
01:27:47,224 --> 01:27:49,720
It may not pay you as well as the baron,
but it will be secure.

1101
01:27:49,752 --> 01:27:52,025
And then your widow and children
will get a pension.

1102
01:27:52,056 --> 01:27:55,768
I'm going to plan my death
so you will get a pension?

1103
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:59,673
I'm sorry, I have better prospects
than that in mind.

1104
01:28:04,377 --> 01:28:06,681
Who's that walking around
up there?

1105
01:28:08,377 --> 01:28:10,073
Can it be the baron?

1106
01:28:10,104 --> 01:28:12,410
Already?

1107
01:28:18,009 --> 01:28:20,249
Listen.

1108
01:28:20,281 --> 01:28:23,225
If I leave,

1109
01:28:23,257 --> 01:28:26,234
I'll never get
another job like this.

1110
01:28:26,266 --> 01:28:29,818
And you--
why should you go?

1111
01:28:29,850 --> 01:28:31,738
You've never seen
much of the world anyway.

1112
01:28:31,770 --> 01:28:33,338
I-- I don't know
why you would go.

1113
01:28:33,369 --> 01:28:36,858
When the baron leaves
on the 14th of October,

1114
01:28:36,889 --> 01:28:39,322
then we are
leaving too.

1115
01:28:42,010 --> 01:28:44,826
It's been some years now,
you and me.

1116
01:28:47,098 --> 01:28:49,114
Don't you forget
your obligations.

1117
01:28:50,970 --> 01:28:52,859
Let's hope

1118
01:28:52,890 --> 01:28:54,779
that the baron
will never find out

1119
01:28:54,810 --> 01:28:56,987
what happened here,
in his servant's room,

1120
01:28:57,018 --> 01:28:58,875
this Midsummer Night.

1121
01:29:02,074 --> 01:29:04,859
Go and shave yourself.

1122
01:29:04,890 --> 01:29:07,578
You don't want him to come home 
and see you looking like this.

1123
01:29:07,610 --> 01:29:10,107
I'll take the dog out

1124
01:29:10,138 --> 01:29:11,610
and I'll come back.

1125
01:29:11,642 --> 01:29:13,530
And you and I
will go to church

1126
01:29:13,562 --> 01:29:15,963
and you will ask God
to forgive you.

1127
01:29:15,994 --> 01:29:17,979
And I will ask Him
to help us,

1128
01:29:18,010 --> 01:29:20,187
all of us.

1129
01:31:49,824 --> 01:31:51,839
My God.

1130
01:31:51,871 --> 01:31:53,855
What a sight
you look.

1131
01:31:53,887 --> 01:31:56,704
Why?
How do I look?

1132
01:31:56,736 --> 01:31:59,456
You're white
as a corpse.

1133
01:31:59,488 --> 01:32:02,112
The sun's rising.

1134
01:32:02,144 --> 01:32:04,865
And the trolls
are dancing.

1135
01:32:04,896 --> 01:32:08,897
Yes, they've been
dancing all night.

1136
01:32:11,232 --> 01:32:13,857
I've got the money.

1137
01:32:13,889 --> 01:32:15,936
How much?

1138
01:32:15,968 --> 01:32:17,953
I took all of it.

1139
01:32:32,225 --> 01:32:34,113
Please come with me.

1140
01:32:34,145 --> 01:32:36,481
I can't go alone,

1141
01:32:36,513 --> 01:32:38,401
not today.

1142
01:32:38,433 --> 01:32:40,321
On Midsummer Day,

1143
01:32:40,353 --> 01:32:42,498
the trains
will be packed.

1144
01:32:42,529 --> 01:32:45,409
I can't--
I can't go alone

1145
01:32:45,441 --> 01:32:47,458
in the midst

1146
01:32:47,490 --> 01:32:51,394
of the black and gray
on the train,

1147
01:32:51,426 --> 01:32:54,786
people looking at me
as if they know.

1148
01:33:00,610 --> 01:33:02,754
Oh, it's so beautiful
out there.

1149
01:33:04,737 --> 01:33:07,778
The garden.

1150
01:33:07,809 --> 01:33:10,051
I never showed you
my little brook, did I?

1151
01:33:12,290 --> 01:33:15,170
I know you'd love it,
all my flowers.

1152
01:33:15,202 --> 01:33:18,402
Miss Julie,

1153
01:33:18,434 --> 01:33:20,674
I am going with you,

1154
01:33:20,706 --> 01:33:23,043
but it has to be
right now, right away.

1155
01:33:30,691 --> 01:33:32,323
What's that?

1156
01:33:32,355 --> 01:33:33,795
Oh.

1157
01:33:33,827 --> 01:33:36,227
What is it?

1158
01:33:36,258 --> 01:33:39,364
-It's my canary.
-Are you taking a cage along with us?

1159
01:33:40,995 --> 01:33:42,307
I'm not
leaving her behind.

1160
01:33:42,339 --> 01:33:44,163
Drop the cage.

1161
01:33:44,195 --> 01:33:46,851
It's the only thing
I'm taking with me from home.

1162
01:33:46,883 --> 01:33:48,900
Drop the cage,
I'm telling you.

1163
01:33:48,931 --> 01:33:52,324
Kathleen will be here
at any minute.

1164
01:33:52,355 --> 01:33:54,531
All right, listen.

1165
01:33:54,563 --> 01:33:56,708
You-- you will go
out the main entry.

1166
01:33:56,739 --> 01:33:58,532
I will use
the servants' entrance.

1167
01:33:58,563 --> 01:34:01,956
And we'll meet outside
the front gate.

1168
01:34:01,987 --> 01:34:04,196
L-l-let go
of that bird.

1169
01:34:04,228 --> 01:34:06,852
Now. Kathleen will
take care of it.

1170
01:34:06,883 --> 01:34:08,868
-No, my little bird.

1171
01:34:08,899 --> 01:34:10,852
He's not
taking you.

1172
01:34:10,884 --> 01:34:11,972
No.

1173
01:34:12,004 --> 01:34:13,573
The bird.
The bird.

1174
01:34:15,108 --> 01:34:16,612
Give it to me.

1175
01:34:16,644 --> 01:34:18,661
My little bird,

1176
01:34:18,692 --> 01:34:20,452
he's not
taking you.

1177
01:34:20,484 --> 01:34:22,341
For God's sake.

1178
01:34:22,372 --> 01:34:24,933
Shut up.
Shut up.

1179
01:34:55,749 --> 01:34:57,637
Kill me too.

1180
01:34:57,669 --> 01:34:59,014
Kill me.

1181
01:34:59,045 --> 01:35:00,934
Killing an innocent
creature

1182
01:35:00,965 --> 01:35:03,654
without blinking
an eye.

1183
01:35:03,685 --> 01:35:06,694
Oh, I hate
and despise you.

1184
01:35:06,726 --> 01:35:09,767
There's blood between us.

1185
01:35:12,582 --> 01:35:15,366
I curse the moment
I saw you.

1186
01:35:15,397 --> 01:35:18,118
I curse
the day I was born.

1187
01:35:18,150 --> 01:35:20,775
Kill me too.

1188
01:35:25,062 --> 01:35:27,079
You think I can't stand

1189
01:35:27,111 --> 01:35:29,447
the sight of blood.

1190
01:35:29,479 --> 01:35:31,430
You think I'm weak.

1191
01:35:31,462 --> 01:35:33,671
Oh, I should like
to see your blood,

1192
01:35:33,702 --> 01:35:35,975
your brains lying there
on the table,

1193
01:35:36,007 --> 01:35:38,183
see your whole sex
swimming in blood

1194
01:35:38,215 --> 01:35:40,231
like my little bird.

1195
01:35:40,262 --> 01:35:42,151
You think
I am weak!

1196
01:35:42,182 --> 01:35:44,295
You think I love
you because my womb

1197
01:35:44,327 --> 01:35:46,215
cried out
for your sperm.

1198
01:35:46,247 --> 01:35:49,160
You think I want to carry
your brat under my heart,

1199
01:35:49,191 --> 01:35:52,296
feed it with my blood
and give it your name!

1200
01:35:52,327 --> 01:35:54,631
You, what are you
called anyhow?

1201
01:35:54,663 --> 01:35:58,119
John, John and then?
What is your family name?

1202
01:35:58,151 --> 01:35:59,720
Maybe you don't
have one.

1203
01:35:59,752 --> 01:36:02,440
I would be Mrs. Lackey,
Mrs. Shit-pile,

1204
01:36:02,472 --> 01:36:05,864
you dog there
wearing my collar,

1205
01:36:05,895 --> 01:36:07,880
you minion
wearing my crest.

1206
01:36:07,911 --> 01:36:09,704
Share you
with Kathleen,

1207
01:36:09,736 --> 01:36:11,624
share you with my
own servant,

1208
01:36:11,656 --> 01:36:14,760
parcel you out to all
the other needy women working here.

1209
01:36:14,792 --> 01:36:17,448
You think I'm a coward
and want to run away.

1210
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:19,720
Oh, no!
No, I'll stay,

1211
01:36:19,752 --> 01:36:21,640
and let
the lightning strike.

1212
01:36:21,672 --> 01:36:24,232
My father
is coming home.

1213
01:36:24,264 --> 01:36:26,537
He'll find his desk
broken into,

1214
01:36:26,568 --> 01:36:28,809
his money gone.

1215
01:36:32,137 --> 01:36:34,281
Then he'll ring
that bell there

1216
01:36:34,313 --> 01:36:36,233
twice for his lackey.

1217
01:36:36,264 --> 01:36:38,153
And he'll send
for the police.

1218
01:36:38,184 --> 01:36:40,808
And I'll tell them
everything-- everything.

1219
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:43,497
Oh, it will be good
to get an end to it.

1220
01:36:43,528 --> 01:36:46,377
And then my father

1221
01:36:46,408 --> 01:36:48,681
will have a stroke
and die.

1222
01:36:48,713 --> 01:36:51,369
And that will be
the end of all of us.

1223
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:53,289
And all will be quiet,
peace,

1224
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:55,337
eternal rest.

1225
01:36:55,369 --> 01:36:58,057
The baron's line
will be wiped out

1226
01:36:58,089 --> 01:36:59,977
and the lackey's line

1227
01:37:00,009 --> 01:37:02,025
will continue
in an orphanage.

1228
01:37:02,057 --> 01:37:04,553
There spoke
the royal blood.

1229
01:37:04,585 --> 01:37:07,689
Dragged up in the gutter,
and dead in the jail.

1230
01:37:07,721 --> 01:37:09,609
Bravo, Miss Julie.

1231
01:37:09,641 --> 01:37:12,490
Make sure the lackey
doesn't lose his place.

1232
01:37:29,674 --> 01:37:31,658
What is going on?

1233
01:37:35,210 --> 01:37:37,259
What a mess
you've made.

1234
01:37:40,842 --> 01:37:44,811
You're a woman,
Kathleen.

1235
01:37:44,843 --> 01:37:47,499
You're my friend.

1236
01:37:47,531 --> 01:37:51,563
You must
understand me.

1237
01:37:51,595 --> 01:37:54,635
You must listen
to me.

1238
01:37:54,666 --> 01:37:57,452
I don't want to know
anything from you, Miss Julie.

1239
01:37:57,483 --> 01:37:59,051
What's going on?

1240
01:38:01,707 --> 01:38:04,395
Kathleen:
What? What?

1241
01:38:04,427 --> 01:38:08,748
Kathleen, you have to
understand me.

1242
01:38:08,779 --> 01:38:10,155
I don't want
to understand.

1243
01:38:10,187 --> 01:38:12,748
You must listen to me.

1244
01:38:12,780 --> 01:38:14,668
If you're planning
on getting John

1245
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:16,748
to go away with you,
Miss Julie,

1246
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:19,500
I will have to stop you,
both of you.

1247
01:38:19,531 --> 01:38:23,084
Quiet, Kathleen,
and listen to me.

1248
01:38:23,115 --> 01:38:24,972
I-- I can't
stay here.

1249
01:38:27,276 --> 01:38:29,164
And John-- he can't
stay here.

1250
01:38:29,196 --> 01:38:32,109
So we have to--
to get away.

1251
01:38:32,140 --> 01:38:33,900
What?

1252
01:38:33,932 --> 01:38:35,916
Wait, I have an idea.

1253
01:38:35,948 --> 01:38:40,077
All three of us can

1254
01:38:40,108 --> 01:38:42,701
go-- go together

1255
01:38:42,732 --> 01:38:44,621
abroad to start
a hotel.

1256
01:38:44,652 --> 01:38:46,733
I have--
I have money, see?

1257
01:38:46,764 --> 01:38:49,293
And John and I

1258
01:38:49,325 --> 01:38:51,213
will run
the whole thing.

1259
01:38:51,245 --> 01:38:53,773
And-- and you can--

1260
01:38:53,805 --> 01:38:56,141
I think,
can run the kitchen.

1261
01:38:56,173 --> 01:38:58,221
Oh, wouldn't that
be fine?

1262
01:38:58,253 --> 01:39:01,101
Oh, please say yes,
Kathleen.

1263
01:39:01,133 --> 01:39:04,046
Come along with us.

1264
01:39:04,077 --> 01:39:06,893
You have to get out
and see the world.

1265
01:39:06,925 --> 01:39:09,294
You can't imagine

1266
01:39:09,325 --> 01:39:11,758
how fun it is
to travel by train.

1267
01:39:11,789 --> 01:39:13,678
We just talked
about it.

1268
01:39:13,709 --> 01:39:15,598
You'll love it.

1269
01:39:15,629 --> 01:39:17,518
Trains whistling,

1270
01:39:17,549 --> 01:39:19,438
carriages stopping,

1271
01:39:19,469 --> 01:39:21,710
bells ringing

1272
01:39:21,741 --> 01:39:24,014
upstairs, downstairs.

1273
01:39:24,045 --> 01:39:26,414
You'll stand--
no, you'll--

1274
01:39:26,446 --> 01:39:29,710
you'll sit in the kitchen
like a queen.

1275
01:39:29,742 --> 01:39:31,630
Of course.

1276
01:39:31,662 --> 01:39:36,046
You're not going to stand
at the stove yourself,

1277
01:39:36,078 --> 01:39:37,966
naturally not,

1278
01:39:37,998 --> 01:39:40,078
with all the fine
clothes

1279
01:39:40,110 --> 01:39:42,447
you'll be wearing
to greet the guests.

1280
01:39:42,479 --> 01:39:44,655
You're so beautiful,
Kathleen.

1281
01:39:44,686 --> 01:39:46,958
Yes. I'm not
flattering you.

1282
01:39:46,990 --> 01:39:50,127
You'll find a husband,
a rich Englishman.

1283
01:39:50,159 --> 01:39:52,655
They're so easy
to catch.

1284
01:39:52,687 --> 01:39:56,527
And we'll be rich.

1285
01:39:56,559 --> 01:40:01,135
We'll build a villa
on Lake Como.

1286
01:40:01,167 --> 01:40:05,327
It rains there

1287
01:40:05,359 --> 01:40:07,247
a little,

1288
01:40:07,279 --> 01:40:10,544
a little,
a little bit

1289
01:40:10,575 --> 01:40:13,487
sometimes.

1290
01:40:13,519 --> 01:40:16,592
But the sun will be
shining sometimes.

1291
01:40:19,503 --> 01:40:21,744
Though it looks dark.

1292
01:40:30,031 --> 01:40:32,081
And...

1293
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:35,888
Then--

1294
01:40:39,856 --> 01:40:41,776
Or...

1295
01:40:41,808 --> 01:40:46,065
we can
go home again,

1296
01:40:46,097 --> 01:40:49,041
come back here

1297
01:40:49,073 --> 01:40:53,073
or...

1298
01:40:53,104 --> 01:40:56,081
somewhere else.

1299
01:41:51,666 --> 01:41:55,219
Do you believe in this
yourself, Miss Julie?

1300
01:42:01,234 --> 01:42:05,139
Do I believe it
myself?

1301
01:42:05,171 --> 01:42:06,707
Yes.

1302
01:42:10,034 --> 01:42:12,083
I don't know.

1303
01:42:12,115 --> 01:42:16,468
I don't know anything
anymore.

1304
01:42:18,451 --> 01:42:20,211
Nothing.

1305
01:42:20,243 --> 01:42:21,683
Nothing at all.

1306
01:42:24,627 --> 01:42:27,316
So you were
going to elope?

1307
01:42:27,348 --> 01:42:29,364
Elope?

1308
01:42:29,395 --> 01:42:32,724
That's a big word.

1309
01:42:32,756 --> 01:42:34,996
You heard
the young lady.

1310
01:42:35,028 --> 01:42:38,100
And maybe
she's tired now

1311
01:42:38,131 --> 01:42:40,404
from being up
all night,

1312
01:42:40,436 --> 01:42:43,284
but it's a plan
that could work.

1313
01:42:43,316 --> 01:42:45,716
Are you telling me

1314
01:42:45,747 --> 01:42:49,268
I'd be the kitchen girl
for her?

1315
01:42:49,300 --> 01:42:51,188
Her?

1316
01:42:51,220 --> 01:42:53,108
Will you please
speak more refined

1317
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:55,093
when you're talking
in front of your mistress?

1318
01:42:55,124 --> 01:42:56,884
Do you understand?

1319
01:42:56,916 --> 01:43:00,084
My God.
Listen to you.

1320
01:43:00,116 --> 01:43:02,005
It would be better
for you

1321
01:43:02,036 --> 01:43:04,468
to listen
a little more

1322
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:07,733
and talk
a little less.

1323
01:43:09,589 --> 01:43:11,765
She is
your mistress.

1324
01:43:11,797 --> 01:43:14,965
If you despise her
for what she has done,

1325
01:43:14,997 --> 01:43:18,262
you should
despise yourself.

1326
01:43:20,757 --> 01:43:23,029
I have always
respected myself.

1327
01:43:23,061 --> 01:43:24,725
And looked down
on others.

1328
01:43:24,757 --> 01:43:27,894
And I have never done
anything that is beneath me.

1329
01:43:27,925 --> 01:43:30,453
You could never say
that the baron's cook

1330
01:43:30,485 --> 01:43:33,558
had lowered herself to be with 
the stable groom or the swineherd.

1331
01:43:33,590 --> 01:43:36,182
Quite so.
You had me.

1332
01:43:36,214 --> 01:43:38,326
And very lucky
for you too.

1333
01:43:39,958 --> 01:43:41,397
Lucky?

1334
01:43:41,429 --> 01:43:43,862
A man who steals
from the baron?

1335
01:43:43,894 --> 01:43:46,742
You shouldn't be
talking.

1336
01:43:46,774 --> 01:43:50,710
You, who can't even respect your own
mistress anymore.

1337
01:43:54,454 --> 01:43:56,630
John,

1338
01:43:56,662 --> 01:44:00,279
are you coming with me
to church?

1339
01:44:00,310 --> 01:44:02,615
You could use
a good sermon.

1340
01:44:04,919 --> 01:44:06,870
No.

1341
01:44:06,902 --> 01:44:10,007
I am not going
to church today.

1342
01:44:11,862 --> 01:44:15,095
You go alone
and confess your sins.

1343
01:44:17,462 --> 01:44:19,639
Yes.

1344
01:44:19,671 --> 01:44:22,615
I'll do that.

1345
01:44:22,647 --> 01:44:26,519
And I'll bring back
enough forgiveness for you too.

1346
01:44:26,550 --> 01:44:28,439
Jesus suffered

1347
01:44:28,471 --> 01:44:30,456
and died on the cross
for us.

1348
01:44:30,487 --> 01:44:33,944
And if we go to him
with an open heart

1349
01:44:33,976 --> 01:44:35,864
and all our sorrows,

1350
01:44:35,896 --> 01:44:38,456
he will take our sins
on himself.

1351
01:44:41,527 --> 01:44:45,304
You really believe that,
Kathleen?

1352
01:44:47,192 --> 01:44:50,360
I've believed it
all my life, Miss Julie.

1353
01:44:50,392 --> 01:44:52,952
And that is why
I stand here now

1354
01:44:52,983 --> 01:44:55,256
with the faith
of my childhood.

1355
01:44:59,736 --> 01:45:03,545
Where sin overflows,

1356
01:45:03,576 --> 01:45:07,321
there grace
overflows more.

1357
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:10,649
Oh, if--

1358
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:13,369
if only I had
your faith.

1359
01:45:22,136 --> 01:45:25,753
It is not given
to everyone,

1360
01:45:25,785 --> 01:45:29,722
without God's
special favor.

1361
01:45:29,753 --> 01:45:32,602
Not everyone
deserves it.

1362
01:45:32,633 --> 01:45:35,034
To whom
does He give it?

1363
01:45:39,929 --> 01:45:41,946
Only God
knows that.

1364
01:45:45,018 --> 01:45:48,602
It is a work of grace,
Miss Julie.

1365
01:45:48,633 --> 01:45:52,698
And God is no respecter
of status,

1366
01:45:52,730 --> 01:45:56,698
except the last
shall be first.

1367
01:46:03,354 --> 01:46:06,234
So He helps
the last then?

1368
01:46:06,266 --> 01:46:09,146
And it is easier

1369
01:46:09,178 --> 01:46:12,794
for a camel to pass
through the eye of a needle

1370
01:46:12,826 --> 01:46:15,035
than for a rich man
to enter

1371
01:46:15,066 --> 01:46:17,467
the Kingdom of Heaven.

1372
01:46:19,898 --> 01:46:22,748
So you see, Miss Julie,
it's just the way it is.

1373
01:46:32,699 --> 01:46:34,779
Well...

1374
01:46:36,251 --> 01:46:38,140
I am going

1375
01:46:38,171 --> 01:46:40,028
alone.

1376
01:46:41,723 --> 01:46:44,667
And as I pass
by the stableman,

1377
01:46:44,699 --> 01:46:48,316
I shall tell him
not to let out the horses

1378
01:46:48,347 --> 01:46:50,236
if someone should like
to get away

1379
01:46:50,267 --> 01:46:52,348
before the baron
comes home.

1380
01:47:00,667 --> 01:47:02,557
Goodbye.

1381
01:47:23,164 --> 01:47:26,557
What would you do
in my place?

1382
01:47:26,588 --> 01:47:28,893
In your place?

1383
01:47:28,924 --> 01:47:32,221
Let me see.

1384
01:47:32,252 --> 01:47:36,573
Well, as a lady,
as a woman,

1385
01:47:36,605 --> 01:47:39,901
after that kind
of mistake,

1386
01:47:39,933 --> 01:47:43,134
as one
who has fallen...

1387
01:47:45,373 --> 01:47:47,550
I don't know.

1388
01:48:01,694 --> 01:48:03,999
Yes.

1389
01:48:22,430 --> 01:48:24,415
I do know.

1390
01:48:49,183 --> 01:48:51,391
With this?

1391
01:48:51,423 --> 01:48:53,504
Yes.

1392
01:48:57,791 --> 01:49:00,128
But I wouldn't do it.

1393
01:49:03,584 --> 01:49:05,441
I wouldn't.

1394
01:49:07,424 --> 01:49:09,696
Do you understand?

1395
01:49:09,728 --> 01:49:12,961
There is

1396
01:49:12,992 --> 01:49:15,937
a difference
between us.

1397
01:49:21,216 --> 01:49:24,225
It's the same difference
as between a man and a woman.

1398
01:49:30,977 --> 01:49:32,865
This about
a rich person

1399
01:49:32,897 --> 01:49:34,785
not getting
to heaven--

1400
01:49:34,817 --> 01:49:37,185
it's a lie,
isn't it?

1401
01:49:50,465 --> 01:49:52,993
The baron is back.

1402
01:49:53,025 --> 01:49:54,913
Kathleen.
What if Kathleen--?

1403
01:49:54,945 --> 01:49:57,090
He's seen his desk.

1404
01:49:59,393 --> 01:50:02,114
Yes, it is John,
Your Lordship.

1405
01:50:02,146 --> 01:50:04,898
Yes, Your Lordship.

1406
01:50:04,930 --> 01:50:06,946
Right away.

1407
01:50:06,977 --> 01:50:10,050
In half an hour,
your lordship.

1408
01:50:10,082 --> 01:50:12,482
Yes, yes.
In half an hour.

1409
01:50:28,066 --> 01:50:30,147
He called
for his boots.

1410
01:50:30,178 --> 01:50:32,835
Wants his coffee
in half an hour.

1411
01:50:33,954 --> 01:50:36,227
Julie:
Half an hour.

1412
01:50:44,323 --> 01:50:46,211
I'm exhausted.

1413
01:50:46,243 --> 01:50:48,099
I don't know
what to do.

1414
01:50:49,187 --> 01:50:51,907
To run, to stay,

1415
01:50:51,939 --> 01:50:55,715
live or die.

1416
01:50:58,019 --> 01:50:59,908
You know
what I want to do,

1417
01:50:59,939 --> 01:51:03,427
but I don't know
how to do it.

1418
01:51:03,459 --> 01:51:05,700
Make me.

1419
01:51:10,531 --> 01:51:12,324
Order me.

1420
01:51:12,355 --> 01:51:14,628
I'll obey you
like a dog.

1421
01:51:14,660 --> 01:51:16,932
I can't.

1422
01:51:18,948 --> 01:51:22,340
I don't know why.
I-- I--

1423
01:51:22,372 --> 01:51:27,620
it's as if
just wearing this jacket,

1424
01:51:27,652 --> 01:51:30,629
I cannot order you.

1425
01:51:30,660 --> 01:51:34,213
I-- I-- I heard
the baron's voice.

1426
01:51:34,244 --> 01:51:37,541
Now,

1427
01:51:37,572 --> 01:51:40,005
I can't explain it,
but--

1428
01:51:42,212 --> 01:51:45,285
Oh, God, it's that--

1429
01:51:45,317 --> 01:51:48,517
it's that damn servant boy
sitting on my back.

1430
01:51:52,773 --> 01:51:54,757
I-- I-- I do
what I'm told.

1431
01:51:54,788 --> 01:51:58,213
I-- if he-- the baron
came down here now

1432
01:51:58,245 --> 01:52:01,606
and told me
to cut my throat,

1433
01:52:01,637 --> 01:52:03,942
I'd do it
on the spot.

1434
01:52:05,861 --> 01:52:08,390
Then pretend
that you are him.

1435
01:52:10,053 --> 01:52:13,574
And pretend
that I am you.

1436
01:52:15,782 --> 01:52:19,271
Did you ever
see a magician at the theatre?

1437
01:52:20,646 --> 01:52:22,534
The magician says,

1438
01:52:22,566 --> 01:52:24,967
"You do everything
I tell you,"

1439
01:52:24,998 --> 01:52:27,335
and she does
what she is told.

1440
01:52:27,366 --> 01:52:30,342
He says,

1441
01:52:30,374 --> 01:52:32,294
"Take the broom,"

1442
01:52:32,326 --> 01:52:35,719
and she takes it.

1443
01:52:35,750 --> 01:52:39,014
He says, "Sweep,"

1444
01:52:39,046 --> 01:52:41,511
and she sweeps.

1445
01:52:44,262 --> 01:52:46,535
I see silver
and gold...

1446
01:52:48,167 --> 01:52:51,143
and all the stars.

1447
01:52:51,174 --> 01:52:54,215
Just like when I went
to sleep as a child.

1448
01:52:54,247 --> 01:52:58,151
I'm floating
out of the window and up to the sky.

1449
01:52:58,183 --> 01:53:00,199
Such freedom,

1450
01:53:00,231 --> 01:53:03,080
surrounded by
sparkling crystal.

1451
01:53:05,095 --> 01:53:07,560
And the dark

1452
01:53:07,592 --> 01:53:10,663
is no longer dark.

1453
01:53:10,695 --> 01:53:13,031
The whole room

1454
01:53:13,063 --> 01:53:16,455
is warm and safe
like an open fire.

1455
01:53:16,487 --> 01:53:19,335
It's you.

1456
01:53:19,367 --> 01:53:22,664
And I am close
to the fire.

1457
01:53:24,552 --> 01:53:26,952
How nice and warm
it is.

1458
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:34,089
And it is so quiet

1459
01:53:34,120 --> 01:53:36,553
and so light.

1460
01:53:56,585 --> 01:53:58,762
Here is the broom.

1461
01:54:01,193 --> 01:54:03,338
Go to the barn.

1462
01:54:03,369 --> 01:54:06,122
Use it.

1463
01:54:06,153 --> 01:54:08,394
Go now,
while it's light.

1464
01:54:08,425 --> 01:54:10,314
Use the tunnel,

1465
01:54:10,345 --> 01:54:13,609
so you don't meet
your father.

1466
01:54:13,641 --> 01:54:15,593
Thank you.

1467
01:54:20,873 --> 01:54:23,466
Tell me

1468
01:54:23,497 --> 01:54:25,674
that the first
can also receive

1469
01:54:25,706 --> 01:54:29,290
the gift of grace.

1470
01:54:29,322 --> 01:54:32,074
Say it even if you don't
believe it.

1471
01:54:32,106 --> 01:54:34,762
The first?

1472
01:54:34,794 --> 01:54:37,611
No, I can't do that.

1473
01:54:40,938 --> 01:54:44,586
But wait.

1474
01:54:44,618 --> 01:54:47,211
Miss Julie, I know.

1475
01:54:49,738 --> 01:54:52,555
You no longer belong
among the first.

1476
01:54:54,474 --> 01:54:56,972
Oh, you're among
the last.

1477
01:54:59,787 --> 01:55:02,476
I am
one of the last.

1478
01:55:05,643 --> 01:55:07,787
Oh.

1479
01:55:29,772 --> 01:55:32,556
And the first

1480
01:55:32,588 --> 01:55:34,316
shall be the last.

1481
01:55:35,372 --> 01:55:37,612
Don't speak.

1482
01:55:37,644 --> 01:55:40,044
Don't think.

1483
01:55:40,076 --> 01:55:41,933
Don't think.

1484
01:55:44,716 --> 01:55:46,765
Go, Miss Julie.

1485
01:55:46,796 --> 01:55:49,068
No other way.

1486
01:55:49,100 --> 01:55:51,053
Go.

1487
01:55:52,748 --> 01:55:54,669
Wait.

1488
01:58:55,346 --> 01:58:58,258
I'm sending you out
into the world.

1489
01:59:01,554 --> 01:59:03,731
Look.

1490
01:59:03,763 --> 01:59:07,571
You're like
bright-colored stars.

1491
01:59:07,603 --> 01:59:10,291
The water
is your heaven.

1492
01:59:12,466 --> 01:59:14,355
Do you know that,

1493
01:59:14,386 --> 01:59:17,299
my flowers?

1494
01:59:17,331 --> 01:59:20,307
Yes.

1495
01:59:20,338 --> 01:59:23,284
Everything is
so much bigger

1496
01:59:23,315 --> 01:59:27,411
than the little
pieces.

1497
01:59:27,443 --> 01:59:29,460
Do you know that?
