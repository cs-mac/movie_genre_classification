1
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,826
What is it? What is it?

2
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,428
My head! My head!

3
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,083
Are you mad?
Or do you wish my son dead?

4
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,745
No, madam. I love him.

5
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:51,915
I know that what you would have done
is stupid and reckless.

6
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:53,720
Don't touch him!
I forbid you to hurt him!

7
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,953
O Majesty!

8
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,052
Uncle.

9
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,120
Be patient my child.

10
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:01,530
The doctors maybe trusted
with the life of the king.

11
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,442
It is his third attack
in a month.

12
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:13,311
He may well die
of this illness.

13
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:17,543
We would be stupid not to consider
it, and your fate upon us if he does.

14
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:20,177
He will not die.
I will not let you talk of it.

15
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:21,720
Oh, yes, you will, Mary.

16
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,653
I shall be plainer
than my brother.

17
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:26,385
We of Guise, the family of
de Guise, have all finished.

18
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,620
If François dies, and there
is no child of your body...

19
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:29,992
I will not think of life
without him.

20
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,121
You must.

21
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:34,291
You are Queen of Scotland by birth
and Queen of France by marriage.

22
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:35,800
And the Queen of England
by right.

23
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:40,600
<i>Elizabeth is bastard and has no
right to the throne of England</i>

24
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:44,639
<i>A woman who consorts
with her horse master</i>

25
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:08,063
Beautiful, Robin.
Beautiful.

26
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,068
You write songs
as well as you sing them.

27
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,468
Your Majesty,
the composer of such a melody

28
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,733
rises far above my poor talent.

29
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,274
I came across the tune
when I was looking

30
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:19,209
through some old manuscripts
at the Greenwich Place.

31
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,643
I thought it might
amuse you to hear it.

32
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:21,737
Well, who wrote it?

33
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:25,682
It is said that your father composed it
for you blessed mother, Anne Boleyn,

34
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,049
before they were married.

35
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,314
Oh.

36
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,289
It is also said that when he
asked her how she liked it,

37
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:34,520
she countered by asking him
how his wife liked it.

38
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:46,469
By God, my mother had the courage
of ten, and so have you, you horse.

39
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,965
A message for the Queen.

40
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,677
Message for the Queen.

41
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:59,014
From Sir William Cecil,
my lord.

42
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,002
Your wife has been
found dead.

43
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,196
Of a broken neck
at the foot of a staircase.

44
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,267
I grieve for you,
Lord Robert.

45
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:26,903
Lady Dudley was alone
in her house.

46
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,671
There is talk of murder.

47
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:38,152
You will leave the court at once
and not return until I send for you.

48
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:53,396
Now will the great scandal begin.
Now will my enemies rejoice.

49
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,775
What do your spies
at court say

50
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,743
the Spanish ambassador made
of this news?

51
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,278
He remained silent.

52
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:01,938
And the French ambassador?
He exults.

53
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:03,311
And says?

54
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,279
And says?

55
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:09,879
That soon he will see Mary
Stuart on the English throne.

56
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,947
"For not even the Protestant
English will support

57
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:17,291
"the bastard and usurper, Elizabeth,
when she marries her horse master, Dudley,

58
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:20,332
"who has killed his wife
to make room for her."

59
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:27,872
He is innocent.

60
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,237
Let him prove it.

61
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,401
When I was in great danger
in my late sister's reign

62
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:32,910
he did not desert me.

63
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,447
Your Majesty,
you are in great danger now,

64
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,313
from Mary Stuart
and the Catholic cause.

65
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:41,444
Mary Stuart? She's safe
in France for a lifetime.

66
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,886
Is she?

67
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:45,549
They say her husband
has fevers of the brain.

68
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,992
If he should die, what
direction would Mary turn?

69
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:50,323
Remember,

70
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,528
her mother rules
as regent in Scotland.

71
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:56,033
Mary Stuart's mother
does not rule in Scotland,

72
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,764
she tyrannizes Scotland
with the French army.

73
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,306
She forces the Catholic faith
down Scottish throats.

74
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,398
Half her nobles are Protestant

75
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,636
and in open rebellion rule,
you say.

76
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,699
She barely survives.

77
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:08,770
I fear neither Mary Stuart in France
nor her mother in Scotland.

78
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,282
Nor your own Catholic nobles
who live in the north,

79
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,647
hard upon the Scottish border?

80
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,481
Why should I?

81
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,617
They are not persecuted.
I am no tyrant.

82
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,318
Scotland is the backdoor
to England.

83
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,591
It must not be unbarred by a
scandal in the English court.

84
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:27,827
If you protect Lord Robert Dudley
and seem to condone a murder,

85
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,427
the Northern lords are going to
believe that next you will marry him.

86
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:34,803
The rumor is everywhere.
They are certain to rebel.

87
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:49,413
Bring him to trial in
open court, hide nothing.

88
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,919
It hurts! It hurts! It's like
burning arrows in my brain.

89
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,189
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!

90
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,006
Please, François, come in.
Please.

91
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,201
No, no, no, no.

92
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,244
I will ride from the pain.
It goes when I ride.

93
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:13,539
Please!

94
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,009
No, no. I must!

95
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,249
François, please!

96
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:25,353
François!

97
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,291
François!

98
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:36,160
Bring me a chair.

99
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,498
Please, come back inside,
Your Grace.

100
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,405
I must keep vigil
for the king.

101
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,323
Almighty God, if you love
François more than I do,

102
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,225
then take him to you,
but take me as well

103
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:06,287
for I have no wish
to live without him.

104
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:07,832
Your Majesty.

105
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:09,925
Who's there?

106
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,162
A Scottish lord.

107
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:25,243
Lord Bothwell, emissary from your brother,
Lord James Stuart, regent of Scotland.

108
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:27,446
James?

109
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,716
No, my mother is regent.

110
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,848
Madam, you mother is dead.

111
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,691
Your mother is dead.

112
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,421
No!

113
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:42,428
I'm sent ahead by your brother
to prepare you.

114
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:50,298
Whatever James Stuart says to you,
remember this, madam,

115
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,438
there is terrible disorder
in your land.

116
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,980
The clans already fight
for power.

117
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:57,839
This is my land.

118
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:00,681
You are needed in Scotland,
madam.

119
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,311
François!

120
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,153
<i>François!</i>

121
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,294
<i>CATHERINE DE MEDICl: Enough!</i>

122
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,966
Against my will,
my son married her.

123
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,433
Now, he's dead.

124
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:26,637
She's the cause.

125
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:27,770
Oh, no.

126
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:31,972
I'll rule here,
until my second son is of age.

127
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:37,315
If you defy me, my lords, I will
not only banish her from the court,

128
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,619
I will exile her from France.

129
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,235
Brother, help me.
What must I do?

130
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,293
You were always so kind to me,
when we were children together.

131
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,838
Tell me what to do now, James.

132
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,534
Mary, if you wish it, I will
take you home to Scotland

133
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,736
and there you will rule
as the rightful Queen.

134
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,780
You have no need of
foreign marriages or armies.

135
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:04,543
But would I be happy? Will
the people of Scotland love me?

136
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,950
Tolerate the new religion, Your Grace,
and they will give you their hearts.

137
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,453
She shall not.

138
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:10,853
Uncle, I must.

139
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:13,120
I cannot live out my years
in exile,

140
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:16,593
I must believe there is hope
for a new life in Scotland.

141
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,789
Will you help me, my lords?

142
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,154
Your Majesty.

143
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:21,392
Your Majesty.

144
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,465
My lords.

145
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:27,001
The usurper Elizabeth
will be my neighbor, yes?

146
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,437
She will.

147
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:31,704
Well, then, I will make
a new beginning with her

148
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,108
as well as my
Protestant subjects.

149
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,306
I will travel to Scotland
through England.

150
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,680
I will go to the court of Elizabeth,
and win her friendship.

151
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,482
Never.

152
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:43,784
I would have no dealing with that lady,
and I will use force if I must,

153
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,687
to stop her returning
to Scotland.

154
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,692
That is unwise,
Your Grace.

155
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,018
Explain.

156
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,090
Because, Your Majesty,
if we do not bring her to Scotland,

157
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,292
subservient to
a Protestant court,

158
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,665
she will soon arrive with
a Catholic army at her back.

159
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:59,033
Her uncles will see to that.

160
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:01,504
If that happens, she'll soon
be knocking on the back door.

161
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:04,042
And what will prevent her
doing that now?

162
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:06,236
Are the Protestant lords
of the congregation in Scotland

163
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:07,973
so devoted to me?

164
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,878
Well, madam,
I am first amongst them

165
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:13,544
and I am devoted to peace
and order in our two lands.

166
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,247
Once we have her safe in Edinburgh
there is no further danger.

167
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:19,655
Mary Stuart will rule in name,
I will rule in fact.

168
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,793
If you value my friendship
you will keep that promise.

169
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,734
Then she shall come home.
Yes.

170
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:34,068
But not through my realm.

171
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,984
Duc de Guise, madam.

172
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:51,914
Uncle François!

173
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:58,585
Mary.

174
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:01,996
Is it from Elizabeth?

175
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,952
She refuses me safe conduct
through England.

176
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,455
She hates me.

177
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:27,048
She fears you.

178
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:31,453
She says, "Renounce your claim
to the English throne."

179
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,857
You renounce nothing,

180
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,868
neither your voyage home
to Scotland,

181
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,530
nor your true claim
to the throne of England.

182
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:43,769
Quite right, brother. That is
the ruling of Holy Mother Church.

183
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,668
Madam, you are the English Queen.

184
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:49,077
Elizabeth is bastard
and heretic.

185
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:50,939
You're right.

186
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,447
Who's this priest, uncle?

187
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:58,682
He's Father Ballard,
your new chaplain and confessor.

188
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,054
An English priest?

189
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,854
But I'm no longer Englishman.

190
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,861
Or Frenchmen or Scotsman.

191
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:06,261
There are in all life and death matters
only two sorts of man,

192
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,924
Catholic and heretic.

193
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,558
Only a fool thinks otherwise.

194
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,000
I shall not forget it.

195
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:15,632
And this is David Riccio,
a singer from Italy.

196
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:19,442
I have traveled far
to serve you, Your Grace.

197
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:22,344
And we are far to go.
Walk with me.

198
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,178
Only two sorts of men,

199
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:27,650
which sort are the English priest
and the little Italian?

200
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,282
The priest is a Jesuit serving only you,
the true Queen of England.

201
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,926
You may trust him
with your life.

202
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,588
The singer is
the agent of the Pope.

203
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,654
Yours will be
a Protestant court.

204
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,963
You need a safe and secret
way to your real friends.

205
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:47,699
Ourselves in France, Philip in
Spain and His Holiness in Rome.

206
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:52,673
Riccio is the way. Let him
seem to sing for his supper.

207
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:56,376
Promote him, slowly,
and trust him.

208
00:16:56,448 --> 00:17:00,544
He speaks many languages
and he's expert with ciphers.

209
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:01,916
Andrew!

210
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:06,151
Move those lazy whores and peasants
before I take the flat of my sword to them.

211
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:10,719
Lower your voice, my gracious lord,
the sound of it is hard to bear.

212
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:13,458
Well, then you must stuff
your delicate ears, madam.

213
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,500
You are going to hear
many like it in Scotland,

214
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:18,798
when you've left the twitterings
of the French court behind.

215
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,967
If that is an example of Scottish wit,
we're in for a bleak winter.

216
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:28,839
Lord Bothwell, we now sail
direct to Scotland.

217
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:32,577
Oh, that will be a rougher
voyage than the Channel, madam.

218
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,744
I'm not afraid of the sea,
my lord.

219
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:45,395
We shall next meet
at the Port of Leith, Your Grace,

220
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:49,491
where I shall have your white horses fit
for your triumphal ride into Edinburgh.

221
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,731
Shall I ride in triumph, Bothwell?
Will all be well?

222
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:56,708
Well, there's only one question,
Your Grace.

223
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:00,704
Will you rule the Scottish lords
or will they rule you?

224
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,145
I shall rule the lords.

225
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:08,848
I wish you then, Queen
Mary Stuart, a fare journey.

226
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:38,874
Adieu, François.

227
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,016
Goodbye, dear France.
Goodbye.

228
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,854
I never thought to
be sad at returning home.

229
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:50,486
It's so long
since we all left there.

230
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:55,158
Sad. Dear Fleming, now it
comes to it, I welcome Scotland.

231
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,216
There will be two ships.

232
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:14,411
The Queen in one and Bothwell,
as escort, in the other.

233
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,151
Your sea captains
can take Bothwell's ship, here.

234
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:23,193
Why? It'll provoke French anger
and Scottish, to no purpose.

235
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:26,129
If I am to keep my promise,
we must cage Bothwell.

236
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:27,358
He's dangerous.

237
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:30,162
With him to help her,
Mary might find a way

238
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:32,533
to finish me
and rule Scotland alone.

239
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,333
But he is no papist.

240
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:35,430
He's worse.

241
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,499
He's an atheist who mocks God
and fears no man.

242
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:42,377
His pride is his loyalty to the
Stuart Queen and he cannot be bribed.

243
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:43,675
Cannot?

244
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,976
I hope we catch him alive,
my lord.

245
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,885
I'd like to study
such a rarity.

246
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,340
Where are we,
in the name of God?

247
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,850
I don't know, Majesty.

248
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:23,012
The captain swears
this is the charted landing place.

249
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,518
Listen...

250
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:02,554
Jamie!

251
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:08,398
Good health to Your Majesty.
Welcome to Scotland.

252
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:12,403
James, what has happened?
Where are my people?

253
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:16,703
For five days fog has lain over land and sea.
You were not expected so soon.

254
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,037
But you are here?

255
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,874
We rode hard
when the warning gun fired.

256
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:24,272
Your loyal lords of the congregation
welcome you.

257
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,078
Oh, I understand.

258
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:30,313
Then soon the royal guards will be here,
the carpet for me to stand upon the canopy.

259
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:31,947
There will be gun salutes?

260
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:35,551
No, madam, there will be nothing.
We can waste no money on idle show.

261
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,651
Aye!

262
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:38,127
This is not France.

263
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:41,361
God bless Scotland.

264
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:47,433
And God bless the Scottish Queen,
who is so near her throne at last.

265
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,742
My lords of the Congregation,

266
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:06,848
you do me great honor
to ride in such haste to meet me.

267
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:12,958
My good brother shows great wisdom
that he wastes no money upon ceremony.

268
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,362
Aye.

269
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:17,800
Good brother, I embrace you
for your wisdom.

270
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:22,066
And before these lords
I name you my Chief Minister.

271
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,005
God save the Queen!

272
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:26,306
God save the Queen!

273
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:28,710
I thank you, dear sister.
Bring the horses.

274
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,805
Bring the Queen's horses.

275
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,745
These are not mine. I will
wait until mine have landed.

276
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:39,450
Your stable was
taken by the English.

277
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,348
Taken? How can that be?

278
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:43,519
They are in the other ship.
Bothwell has them safe.

279
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:44,687
His ship was captured.

280
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:47,459
It had no safe conduct
through English waters.

281
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,659
Elizabeth's ambassador
has already complained to me.

282
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:51,430
And Bothwell, is he dead?

283
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,334
They have him safely.

284
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,540
It is only three days since the two ships
parted company in the fog.

285
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:04,480
And yet you, brother,
know everything of its fate,

286
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,581
and the fate of Lord Bothwell.

287
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:11,855
Even the fastest horseman could not ride
from London to Edinburgh in three days.

288
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:16,257
Will you mount, your Majesty? It is
a sharp morning and we must move on.

289
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:35,942
Faster! Faster! Faster!

290
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:10,439
Well, Robin?

291
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:14,975
My wife's death is judged to be an accident.
I am declared innocent, Your Majesty,

292
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:19,149
despite all efforts of Cecil's spies
to find evidence against me.

293
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:21,754
Then you are indeed innocent.

294
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,554
So you may return to court.

295
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:25,721
If you permit it.

296
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,196
I order it.

297
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:31,132
And I order you to take
the apartment above my own.

298
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:35,471
I feel I will have need
of your advice, constantly.

299
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:41,608
If you would have me
constantly at your side,

300
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,614
then marry me, my love.

301
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:49,583
In this land there will be
but one mistress and no master.

302
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,680
Then, madam,
I will come no more to court.

303
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:53,883
I will leave this land.

304
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,483
You shall not.

305
00:24:56,228 --> 00:25:00,324
You are my Master of Horse.
When they jibe at me in Catholic Courts,

306
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:02,559
they say the Horse Master,
who mounts the Queen so freely,

307
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:03,999
would now put
a bridal on her.

308
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:06,731
You dare to
talk to me of marriage?

309
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:09,774
Forgive me. It was my
delight in seeing you again.

310
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,401
You are a commoner whose
head itches for a crown.

311
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:14,240
Attend to your common business,
Horse Master.

312
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:15,939
Keep the Scottish Queen's
horses well.

313
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,676
It may suit me to
return them one day.

314
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:24,245
The Scottish Queen...

315
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,326
Here's a pretty widow
for an ambitious lord.

316
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,193
Your grace?

317
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:33,696
I said, Robin, you shall
dine with me tonight,

318
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:37,929
and we will keep each other loving
company until the morning light.

319
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:04,522
Well, there you are, sister.
Your palace at Holyrood.

320
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:06,763
Mary Stuart!

321
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:12,566
God struck down your mother
and he will destroy you.

322
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:13,661
Who is this man?

323
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,069
John Knox, madam.

324
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,471
The leader of our church.

325
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:18,406
Of your church,
not mine, brother.

326
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:19,738
Hear me.

327
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:24,510
I have prayed that this Queen would die
before she set foot on this land.

328
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:28,013
See what she brings with her,
a priest.

329
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,878
Better that she'd come
with French troops.

330
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:34,824
She will comfort the papists
we have driven from this land...

331
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,453
Monks, friars, priests...

332
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:41,556
Nuns and all such filthy persons.

333
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:48,029
One mass is more fearful
than 10,000 armed soldiers.

334
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:49,436
Not to me, sir.

335
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:51,941
You defend the Mass?

336
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:55,673
I defend the Church of Rome,
for that I think is the true Church of God.

337
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:57,180
Ride on.
No.

338
00:26:57,248 --> 00:27:00,684
I will hear with patience
your ugly words, John Knox.

339
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:02,117
For you, like all my subjects,

340
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:05,554
shall have the free use of
your conscience and I of mine.

341
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,886
Ride on.

342
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,426
Papist whore.

343
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:20,461
You have humiliated me.

344
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:23,467
You shall keep your religion,
sister.

345
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:28,640
But I suggest you are
a little more discreet about it.

346
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:30,613
Am I to rule here?

347
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:33,014
We must have no illusions,
you and I.

348
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:36,850
We shared a father
in James the Fifth of Scotland.

349
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:39,890
And I came out on the
wrong side of the blanket.

350
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:43,894
It is the fate of the bastard sons of kings
never to be kings themselves,

351
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:45,623
this I accepted long ago.

352
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:47,426
I am not ambitious
for your crown.

353
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,093
I will resist any man
that tries to take it from you.

354
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,567
You are the Queen.

355
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:54,104
I am the Queen,
but you are to rule.

356
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,333
I want you to be happy.

357
00:27:56,408 --> 00:28:00,742
You shall have dancing, and hunting,
music and good eating.

358
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:03,474
But leave the troubles of state
to me.

359
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,314
Come, Mary.

360
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:14,618
A secret way
to the royal apartments.

361
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:20,128
Follow me.

362
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,339
Your bedchamber.

363
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,908
I persuaded your uncle,
the Cardinal,

364
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:45,354
to permit me to bring from France
all your personal belongings.

365
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:47,618
Thank you. I thank
you with all my heart.

366
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:50,991
Here you will dine

367
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:53,158
and take your ease.

368
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:07,338
And this is where
we will hold council.

369
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:11,182
Your Presence Chamber.

370
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,739
Prepare yourself,
and in an hour

371
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:16,753
I will bring all the lords of Scotland
and present them to you.

372
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,319
You have made
a good beginning.

373
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:22,291
Remember, be discreet.

374
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:25,022
And consult me
in all things.

375
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:29,062
There will be a private chapel
for the practice of your religion.

376
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:30,726
Stay out of the public eye,
priest,

377
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:33,600
and do not provoke
the lords of the Congregation.

378
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:36,572
And, Mary,
you may travel if you wish.

379
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:38,770
Scotland is a fine land.

380
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:41,175
I thank you, dear brother.

381
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,047
Dear sister.

382
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:58,591
Did you hear him, Davie?
Did you hear him?

383
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:01,632
Run away and play, he tells me,
as if I were a child.

384
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:02,757
Davie, I'm trapped.

385
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,426
Not yet, Your Grace.

386
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,797
He has me in a cage.

387
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:09,897
Then you must appear to sing
sweetly and happily, madam.

388
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:12,875
I cannot do that forever. The lies
stick in my throat. I hate him.

389
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:14,639
He is learning to
trust you.

390
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:17,772
When he trusts you, he will become careless
and then you will have him in a cage.

391
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:20,215
Davie, I have no army,
no treasury, no allies.

392
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:23,220
You have allies. Your
uncles are first among them.

393
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:25,415
They will solve your problems
by finding you a husband.

394
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,548
A great prince.
A Catholic.

395
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:27,852
With an army at his back.

396
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:32,761
To deal with the good James Stuart.
Then you will march south, to England.

397
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,799
First, let us secure Scotland.
Is it possible?

398
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:35,855
It is certain.

399
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:37,060
Then I will marry quickly.

400
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,695
I will not drag out my days
in this barren land.

401
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:44,174
Did you smell those fine
Scottish lords? Mother of God.

402
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:50,744
And to think my sweet mother
endured all this for my sake.

403
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,873
Marriage, then,
shall be our policy.

404
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:56,281
The marriage of Mary Stuart
to any catholic prince

405
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:59,551
will be treated as an act of war
against England.

406
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,321
Tell that, my lords' ambassador,
to your royal masters.

407
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:10,190
We will have no foreign power
upon our northern border.

408
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:16,531
We realize that our sweet young cousin
in Scotland has been deluded

409
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:19,076
by dangerous and self-seeking men.

410
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:23,645
So now we offer
a wise and just solution.

411
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:26,912
We have a plan
for the marriage of Mary.

412
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:30,354
We offer our most loyal
and loving subject,

413
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:33,857
Robert Dudley,
to Mary Stuart in marriage.

414
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:39,227
And we shall tomorrow create him Earl
of Leicester, that he is more worthy.

415
00:31:56,814 --> 00:32:01,148
Mary will not take it.
She will rage against the insult as they do.

416
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,256
No, madam, I must object
again, most strongly

417
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:09,225
against this proposed marriage
between Mary and this gentleman.

418
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:12,195
My God, it is not my choice to go
north to that barbarous country?

419
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,252
It is mine.

420
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:14,423
A commoner,
a Protestant,

421
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:16,524
and the subject of scandal
and rumor? My choice.

422
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:20,435
However, I shall obey with a better heart
knowing I am opposed by Master Cecil.

423
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,336
You are not suitable.

424
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:27,543
My duty is to foresee the result of
English policy and convince the Queen.

425
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:31,446
What you judge ill for me must benefit me,
that is the lesson of our past dealings.

426
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:34,280
And you can feel
a crown upon your head.

427
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:38,547
It is you I love.
Only you.

428
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,851
Then marry Mary.

429
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:45,327
For only when she is married
to a loving subject of mine will I be safe,

430
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:48,729
from the assassin, the fanatic
and the rebellion in her cause.

431
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,597
And she will take him,
because I will send with him

432
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:52,363
the thing she most lusts after,

433
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:56,703
the promise sealed and witnessed
of the English throne at my death.

434
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:58,036
Go and prepare for your journey,

435
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:01,306
and go quickly before my heart
wins over my head.

436
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:05,806
Sweet Majesty.

437
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:16,726
Your Majesty,
you will regret this day.

438
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:21,388
If you think Robert Dudley
will put aside his ambition...

439
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:23,331
Do you really believe
she will not take him?

440
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:24,629
I do.

441
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:27,796
Good. For I do not intend her
to have him,

442
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,607
though I mean the world to
think I do. Oh, no, William.

443
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,007
She shall not have
the brave and faithful Robin!

444
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:37,036
I have someone quite different in mind
as a husband for Mary Stuart.

445
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:38,377
But first, with your help,

446
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:41,748
I must find a suitable ambassador
to bait the trap.

447
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,687
Out. Do not bolt the door.

448
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:56,624
Good sir,
I'm told you cannot be bought.

449
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:57,723
Ah.

450
00:33:58,269 --> 00:33:59,793
You're Cecil.

451
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,230
You give gold
to Scottish traitors.

452
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:08,909
You are penniless because the Lord
James Stuart has sold your lands.

453
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,744
And you may remain here in the tower
until your death.

454
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,647
You have no friends.

455
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,516
I have long had it in mind
to kill you.

456
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,712
I have it in mind
to release you.

457
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:23,458
The price?

458
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:27,323
That you speak honestly to your Queen,
for mine.

459
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:30,729
Here is the Deed of Succession.

460
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:36,797
Nothing is hidden.
I freely offer her the crown.

461
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:42,172
After much thought I consider Mary
to be the just and rightful claimant.

462
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:48,642
There is no signature,
Your Grace.

463
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:50,720
There will be.

464
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:54,189
When your sweet mistress takes
the noble Earl of Leicester in marriage,

465
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:57,386
she guarantees peace
between our two realms.

466
00:34:57,462 --> 00:35:02,331
Then I will sign this sacred promise
and she will inherit all here,

467
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,133
after my death, which, pray God,
will not be too soon.

468
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:07,330
Amen!

469
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:12,601
And I am to take your offer
in secret to my Queen.

470
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:14,338
That is all?
AII.

471
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:19,875
And as a gesture of my sincerity,
I am sending with you Lord Henry Darnley.

472
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,713
Not only will he see you
safely back to Scotland,

473
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:28,987
he will bear my personal greetings
and gifts to your sovereign.

474
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:34,557
He will return to her Majesty
her fine stable of horses.

475
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,100
<i>Lord Darnley is also a cousin,</i>

476
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:40,296
<i>a member of one of England's
oldest catholic families</i>

477
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:44,831
<i>He has a royal claim by blood
to England's throne, second only to Mary's</i>

478
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:50,873
<i>Oh, he is the finest flower of our nobility,
gentle, brave and chivalrous</i>

479
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:53,616
Are you ready, my lord?

480
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:55,913
Ready, Your Grace.

481
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:58,621
God give you
a good journey, my lord.

482
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:01,453
I charge you
to tell our cousin, Mary,

483
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:06,395
it is our deepest regret
that these fine horses were taken in error.

484
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:11,731
Say to her Majesty, "Elizabeth
most abjectly begs her forgiveness."

485
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:13,429
Trust me, Your Grace.

486
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:17,463
I do, good Henry,
to fulfill all my hopes.

487
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:19,904
Farewell, my lords.

488
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:33,483
Darnley looked beautiful,
did he not?

489
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:37,190
I wager you fifty gold crowns
Mary will take him.

490
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:40,321
Madam, it is too serious a matter
for gambling.

491
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,897
Cecil, you may be an expert
in matters of state,

492
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:45,060
but you know very little
of women.

493
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:47,934
Mary is a young widow.
Her blood is hot.

494
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:51,304
It's a strange thing,
I feel I know her.

495
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:54,376
We have never met
and yet I know her.

496
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:56,504
Your reasoning is beyond me.

497
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:02,415
If I were in her position, would I take
the cast-off lover of my enemy as a husband?

498
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:05,011
No, madam.
You'd be full of fury.

499
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:06,922
And would I, in my pride,

500
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:08,982
ignore the document
of the Act of Succession

501
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,392
and look elsewhere for a husband
to spite my enemy?

502
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:12,952
No, madam,
you would not.

503
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,555
No, I would not.
But she will.

504
00:37:16,534 --> 00:37:17,728
And supposing at this time

505
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:21,670
there should come to my court
a beautiful young man on a white horse,

506
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:25,698
with some claim to the English
throne and a Catholic to boot,

507
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:27,243
would I not look upon him
with favor?

508
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:30,280
But with Dudley comes
the future crown of England!

509
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:33,340
No true monarch will turn her back on that,
not even Mary of Scotland.

510
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,009
That monarch is first a woman.

511
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:38,055
You would never ignore such
an offer for a pretty fellow.

512
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:40,386
This woman is first a monarch.

513
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:45,121
Here comes Robin.

514
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:50,493
Madam, you are wrong.
Now I am certain.

515
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:52,866
No woman would choose the boy
before the man.

516
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,802
I will accept your wager.

517
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:58,774
Fifty golden crowns she chooses
Dudley and the succession.

518
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:02,870
If she chooses Dudley, then we are
safe from foreign Catholic princes,

519
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:06,439
though I admit it will be
a hard price for me to pay.

520
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:09,286
If she takes Darnley,
we have given nothing

521
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:12,754
and she has a weak,
degenerate fool as her consort.

522
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:15,849
Win or lose the wager,
I cannot lose the game.

523
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:57,225
Harry! Harry!

524
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:04,938
Oh, my love. My love.

525
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:21,790
Don't move.

526
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,933
Be still.

527
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:37,797
What a happy fall,
to have such a comfort afterwards.

528
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:43,510
There are tears
on your cheeks.

529
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:51,183
I saw again the death of my husband,
that is all.

530
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:18,207
But...
Leave us!

531
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:20,741
Robin!

532
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:22,708
I am rejected.

533
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:25,187
She rejected me.

534
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,758
She kept me waiting five days
without an audience.

535
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:32,023
She flaunted herself before me
in the company of Darnley.

536
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,462
She dances with Darnley,
she dines with Darnley.

537
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:36,159
She rides with Darnley.

538
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:37,962
And has rejected you?

539
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:39,127
With insults.

540
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:42,195
Encouraged by Bothwell,
your honest messenger.

541
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:44,871
She spoke of me openly
as your cast-off lover

542
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,274
and far beneath any true Queen.

543
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:49,436
She must be demented.

544
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:52,971
Before my eyes she tore up
the document of succession.

545
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:56,350
But she consorts
with that boy!

546
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:59,352
That lewd, mincing,
pouting boy.

547
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:06,452
And by all the saints, madam,
she is a woman that needs a man.

548
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,425
What kind of a woman, Robin?

549
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:12,401
Formed like a goddess.

550
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,831
More than I?
Is she better formed than I?

551
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:15,894
No. No, madam.

552
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,440
Well, does she dance
more elegantly?

553
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:18,736
No. But with a certain fire.

554
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,936
Oh, she is fiery! I had
heard that she was very dull

555
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:22,171
and sits by the hour sewing.

556
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:24,214
Does she play instruments
more skillfully than I?

557
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:26,681
No. But to do her justice,
she loves music.

558
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:30,015
Can she converse freely in
Italian, Latin, Greek as I can?

559
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:32,988
Who knows.
But she speaks most charmingly.

560
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:35,517
She charmed you.

561
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:41,888
This woman who has offered me the most
deadly insult, charms you, my lord.

562
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:46,836
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I found her tiresome.

563
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:48,030
Liar!
Madam!

564
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:49,766
Liar! Liar! Liar!
Madam! Madam! Madam!

565
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,172
You were as eager as a
young lover to ride to her.

566
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:53,471
To wed and bed her.

567
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:56,308
I went only at your command.

568
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,871
I love only you. Oh!

569
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:06,714
Well, you have played your
part. I cannot complain.

570
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,052
My part?

571
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:11,587
Oh, it is her loss
if she rejects you.

572
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:16,664
Oh, how glad I am
to have you home.

573
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:21,497
Now tell me truly,
I am no longer angry.

574
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:24,834
Is she really as beautiful
as they say?

575
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:27,343
Well, she is quite beautiful.

576
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:31,743
Get out! Out! Out!
I have it in me to send you

577
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:33,442
to cool your passion for her...

578
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,382
Get out! Out!

579
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,121
May it please Almighty God
she hates me as I hate her,

580
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:50,592
for then she must marry Darnley,
and I have won.

581
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,311
You seem very rich, Davie.

582
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,351
I am valued.

583
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,749
No. You are hated.

584
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:15,087
But not by you,
sweet Harry.

585
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:18,719
The commoner.
The detested, little foreigner.

586
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,698
You are jealous
of my influence.

587
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:28,266
You must speak for me, Davie.
I will be king here.

588
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:31,003
I have the right to be a king.

589
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:35,208
All the Catholic nobles of England
will support Mary's cause if I am king.

590
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:38,771
But you are vicious, Harry.
You have a taste for all the vices.

591
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:40,009
I thought you loved me.

592
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:44,350
I love the Queen better,
and I think it a cruel act

593
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:46,981
to help put you
between her sheets.

594
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:50,217
You want to keep me
between yours?

595
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,524
Oh, Edinburgh is
full of pretty boys,

596
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:54,393
and like you,
I have a taste for a woman as well.

597
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,490
I shall not lack comfort.

598
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:00,931
We are outcasts
in this court.

599
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:05,338
No man is your friend save me,
and no man is mine save you.

600
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,444
Like it or not,
sweet Harry...

601
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:11,373
We must hold to each other.

602
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:15,216
The Queen!

603
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:33,763
Working. Always working.

604
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,202
I could not sleep.

605
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:37,100
Nor I.

606
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,436
Davie, you must advise me.

607
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,409
If I can, Your Grace.

608
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:43,537
Is it not true that all our hopes for
my freedom through marriage are dashed

609
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:45,343
because we are told
if I marry a foreign prince

610
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:46,440
there will be war
with England?

611
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:47,950
It is true.

612
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:49,514
But...

613
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:52,051
What if I married
an Englishman?

614
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:53,346
Englishman?

615
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:54,982
Harry Darnley.

616
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:58,619
Answer me. Is he a good match?

617
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,823
Will the holy father
give his blessing to us?

618
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:02,559
I cannot deny it.

619
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:06,035
I believe it is God's will
that both wise policy

620
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:09,038
and my deepest longings
are fulfilled in him.

621
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,738
I love him.

622
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:14,906
It is the good fortune of Queens to choose
where other women must wait to be chosen.

623
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:18,539
I choose him, Davie. He will be
my husband, my lover, my companion.

624
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:20,640
And your master
if you make him King.

625
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,186
Oh, no, I am the Queen.
He will be my consort.

626
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:25,016
He will understand that
if he loves me.

627
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:27,751
Who could fail
to love Your Majesty?

628
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:30,385
But will the Scottish lords
hate him, Davie?

629
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:33,521
No more than any other
foreigner set over them.

630
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:34,891
What would James say?

631
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:39,536
Oh, what a fine king Darnley
will make. I must have him.

632
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,969
Pray for me, Davie.

633
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:14,303
Does she often
visit you at night, Davie?

634
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:16,271
Oh, we work here in secret.

635
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,900
Is it only for state matters
that she comes?

636
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:22,605
You have the mind of a brothel keeper.
Did you not listen at the door to find out?

637
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:25,170
I listened,
but the door was too thick.

638
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:26,477
Harry...

639
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,685
If I speak for you
with the Queen,

640
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,949
will you at all times
give her first place,

641
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:36,151
acknowledging her the
true monarch of this realm?

642
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:38,217
No. I will be the master.

643
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:41,263
Then I will oppose you.

644
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,733
"I choose him, Davie."

645
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:52,901
When will she find the courage
to ask me? Will it be tomorrow?

646
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,238
Do not betray her.
I warn you.

647
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,471
"What a fine king he will make..."

648
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:56,535
Listen to me.

649
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:58,103
No, listen to her.

650
00:46:58,182 --> 00:47:00,150
"I must have him, Davie."

651
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:03,414
Oh, she shall have me,
and I shall be the master.

652
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:09,149
Kiss the hand of your King, Davie, and
I will forgive you for your little warnings.

653
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,521
Kiss it, Davie.

654
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:19,460
Come.

655
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:21,536
Kneel to me.

656
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,164
Kneel.

657
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:30,112
Say "I will love and serve you, King Henry."

658
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,172
Say it, Davie.

659
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:38,054
It is in God's hands, Henry...

660
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:41,181
But you are reckless
to scorn your only friend.

661
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:44,750
Now the sly little Italian
will try poison against me.

662
00:47:44,828 --> 00:47:48,025
He will whisper in her ear.
He will plant doubts.

663
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:51,391
He fears to lose his place.

664
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:56,536
It's not in God's hands, Davie.

665
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,177
It's in mine.

666
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:17,420
Admit the Lord James Stuart.

667
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:22,527
Madam, what is so important
that I am summoned from Council

668
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:24,260
and then kept waiting at your door?

669
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:27,394
Dear brother,
I wish you to make preparations

670
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:30,935
for my marriage to Henry, Lord Darnley.

671
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:33,832
I forbid that.

672
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:37,338
He is a Catholic.
And neither I nor John Knox...

673
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:40,713
John Knox, that hypocrite
who has just married a girl of 15.

674
00:48:40,784 --> 00:48:43,878
That aged lecher
who hides behind the words of God.

675
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:48,622
Madam,
you forget yourself.

676
00:48:48,892 --> 00:48:51,725
No. I do not. You shall
not prevent my happiness.

677
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:54,195
I will marry Henry,
Lord Darnley.

678
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:57,233
I will speak to you again
when you have more control of yourself.

679
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:58,563
Guards!

680
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:16,713
It was a bad day for you, James,
when you sold off my lands.

681
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:23,121
From this moment I alone rule in
Scotland. Now who is caged, brother?

682
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:25,927
David Riccio, I choose
you as my Chief Minister.

683
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:28,362
James Stuart, Earl of Moray,
I banish you from my kingdom.

684
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:31,959
Give up your keys and seals
of office to Master Riccio.

685
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,698
Riccio, you are a Catholic.

686
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:40,499
Be sure that you are confessed
and in a state of grace each hour.

687
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:44,942
For from this moment, I promise
you, death is at your shoulder.

688
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:47,412
Truly I am
of the old religion

689
00:49:47,617 --> 00:49:52,919
and we shall have such a re-birth of it in
this land as will rejoice the hosts of heaven!

690
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:55,748
Your Majesty,

691
00:49:56,426 --> 00:50:00,157
if you value your safety,
either imprison or execute him.

692
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:02,492
I will not take that advice.

693
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:04,431
But I shall give it to you.

694
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:06,765
When he has gone, the other
lords will bow the knee to you,

695
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:12,434
but in time, when he returns, they will join
him again for bloody revenge on all here.

696
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,005
I will not begin my reign
like a tyrant.

697
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:23,178
Escort my brother to the border
and return as soon as possible.

698
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:26,381
We must prepare for my
marriage to Lord Darnley.

699
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:30,817
And with my body,
I thee worship.

700
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:35,593
And with all my worldly chattels,
I thee endow.

701
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:39,564
And with all my worldly chattels,
I thee endow.

702
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:42,597
In the name of the Father...

703
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,735
In the name of the Father...

704
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:46,435
...and of the Son...

705
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:47,875
...and of the Son...

706
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:49,775
...and of the Holy Ghost.

707
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:51,245
...and of the Holy Ghost.

708
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:52,508
Amen.

709
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:55,678
Amen.

710
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:25,741
I am so happy,
I dare not speak of it.

711
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:34,486
What is that?

712
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:38,050
A gift, Your Grace. From my
Lord Bothwell to the Queen.

713
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:44,258
The jewel from the hilt of his sword,
Your Grace. It is all he has of value.

714
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:46,199
Return it.

715
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,737
The Lord Bothwell
bade me tell you

716
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:51,501
that when you have need of the
sword from which this jewel is taken,

717
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:53,975
then send me Andrew
to summon him.

718
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:57,003
Yes, I will, good Andrew.

719
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:04,151
Harry, look!

720
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,857
If you keep it,
you do not love me.

721
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:13,019
I love you dearly.

722
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:14,620
Then do what I ask.

723
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:17,359
I demand it as your husband.

724
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:21,093
I may not, for then you would
rule here, Henry. That cannot be.

725
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:24,265
You shall rule above all
others, save the Queen.

726
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,300
I am the King.

727
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:30,506
I will be obeyed.

728
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:36,842
I am the King!

729
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:49,588
On the night of his marriage
a King shall be served by his lords.

730
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:53,402
Morton, Ruthven, Huntly,
you shall serve me.

731
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,195
Come. We will show this Queen
who is the master.

732
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:57,638
Your Grace!

733
00:52:58,408 --> 00:53:00,968
I am the Chief Minister,
I will serve you.

734
00:53:01,044 --> 00:53:02,671
I will kneel to serve you
if you wish it.

735
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:06,341
Let these good lords continue
their pleasure on this happy day.

736
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:07,440
No.

737
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:13,248
No. They shall serve us
both, Davie, I order it.

738
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,590
I, your King, order it.

739
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:16,683
No, Your Majesty...

740
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,228
I ordered you to
sit with me, Davie.

741
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:23,232
This is your reward for speaking
to the Queen for your loving friend.

742
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,824
Come, my lords.

743
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:30,467
All servants, get out!
Get out!

744
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:33,302
We have
better servants here.

745
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:36,379
Sit by the Queen,
Master Riccio.

746
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:39,574
It is your right,
for you are the Chief Minister.

747
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:41,315
My lords...

748
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:45,687
You see how I am obeyed,
Madam?

749
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:48,781
I see how you will behave if you were
ever granted the crown matrimonial

750
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:51,656
and become a King
in your own right, my lord.

751
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:53,218
They obey me.

752
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:57,422
When the Queen is served, serve the
Chief Minister, serve him before me.

753
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:01,231
Serve the little Italian,
who is the Pope's friend.

754
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:08,073
Now their hatred for you will be so great,
Davie, they'll have none left for me.

755
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:12,171
My lords, soon I will be
abed with this lady...

756
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:15,112
My Queen.

757
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,720
Therefore I drink a toast
to my firstborn.

758
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:36,929
Your Majesty...

759
00:54:42,345 --> 00:54:43,676
Be seated.

760
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:56,689
I sent for you to
thank you for your gift.

761
00:54:59,596 --> 00:55:01,826
Why are you
leaving Edinburgh?

762
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:07,026
Now that you have chosen a King it is time
I left the court to care for my own affairs.

763
00:55:07,103 --> 00:55:09,333
But I need you here,
Bothwell.

764
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:13,368
But, my lady, you now have
a husband to protect you.

765
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,135
He will lead your army,

766
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:20,245
put down such of your lords
as intrigue against you

767
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,911
and make wise policy,
I have no doubt.

768
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:26,111
Do you oppose my marriage?

769
00:55:26,189 --> 00:55:30,819
I never oppose the rightful monarch.
I've grown poor in the habit.

770
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:32,991
I will not be mocked.

771
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:34,323
"Mocked"?

772
00:55:34,597 --> 00:55:38,192
I could not find words
to mock a Queen of Scotland

773
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:40,736
who chooses a smooth-faced boy
as her master

774
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:43,295
and a base-born Italian
as her Chief Minister!

775
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:46,069
Go then! Leave the court!
Stay from it!

776
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:48,372
Bothwell.

777
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:52,875
You've grown poor
in my service, you say?

778
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:54,007
I have.

779
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:55,642
You shall be paid off,
my lord.

780
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:57,744
I can manage
well enough without.

781
00:55:57,821 --> 00:56:00,221
Spare me your arrogance.
I will give you money!

782
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:03,191
Keep it to buy suits
for your husband.

783
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,354
Why are you angry?

784
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:10,663
Do you fear you are displaced?
Are you jealous?

785
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:16,361
You could say, Your Majesty,
with truth

786
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:19,766
I am jealous.

787
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:26,645
Then you are foolish.

788
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:32,414
I need your help, Bothwell,
to keep order in this country.

789
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:36,649
And in due time
we will march south.

790
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:41,588
We will destroy that heretic Elizabeth,
and I will rule my two Kingdoms,

791
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:44,497
as I was ordained to do,
if God is willing.

792
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:47,893
Will you stay at court
and help me?

793
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:02,980
I will return when I have
settled my affairs on the border.

794
00:57:03,286 --> 00:57:04,378
When?

795
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:07,312
When I have married for money,
Your Grace.

796
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:08,687
Married?

797
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:12,489
Not without my permission, my good lord.
I promise you...

798
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:42,820
Now I know who is King here.
This upstart!

799
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:47,391
And you come creeping
to him at night.

800
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:51,563
That's not my child you're
carrying, it's his bastard!

801
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:54,159
The child is yours, God
help me, the child is yours.

802
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:56,262
You have both betrayed me.

803
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,838
That's why
he speaks against me.

804
00:57:57,907 --> 00:58:01,001
You're not fit to rule.
That's why I oppose you.

805
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:03,375
I am your enemy,
not the Queen!

806
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:05,380
Now go.
You disgust me!

807
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:08,473
I disgust you?

808
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:12,921
You loved me.

809
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:18,391
You loved me.
Now I disgust you.

810
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:22,960
I'm lost.

811
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:28,165
I'm lost.

812
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:53,293
Hawk Master!

813
00:58:57,767 --> 00:58:59,792
Your Majesty!
What is it?

814
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:01,769
The King,
Your Majesty.

815
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:03,532
Mary!

816
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:08,302
Keep the others
at a distance, Seton.

817
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,347
The Queen bids you rest.

818
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:12,773
Mary!

819
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:19,480
Mary!

820
00:59:20,256 --> 00:59:21,348
Mary!

821
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:24,053
You must return at once.
At once.

822
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:26,118
Why are you shouting?
Are you drunk as ever?

823
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:29,790
No. No. Forgive me, Mary, but
there is a plot and you must return.

824
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:31,026
Plot? Are you ill?

825
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:34,331
I'd like to believe that, for then I
could forgive you the bitter shame and pain

826
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:35,871
you've caused me
these past few months.

827
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:38,874
Your own guards turned me back
from the Royal apartments.

828
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:42,673
When I drew my dagger on them they
threatened to kill me... To kill their King.

829
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:45,213
You are not the King. You are
the King consort. That is all.

830
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:47,613
You're merely Henry, Lord Darnley
who married a queen.

831
00:59:47,684 --> 00:59:49,879
If that queen dies,
you will be Henry, Lord Darnley again

832
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:51,614
and have no rights to the crown.

833
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:53,053
It was you!

834
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:54,856
You ordered them
to keep me back!

835
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:56,949
Yes. Your habits disgust me.

836
00:59:57,026 --> 01:00:00,086
You have shamed me. The whole
court will ridicule me, Madam.

837
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:01,494
Then leave the court!

838
01:00:01,564 --> 01:00:02,724
I'm forbidden your bed?

839
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:04,664
You shall never
come near me again.

840
01:00:04,734 --> 01:00:07,567
Ride home, my lord.
You have new apartments.

841
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:13,174
That little bastard Riccio is
behind this. I will be revenged!

842
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:15,038
I will be revenged!

843
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:33,963
Don't kill me.
Don't kill me!

844
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:37,562
Stand up, Your Majesty.
We are your loyal subjects.

845
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:48,770
We believe you are much
wronged, Your Grace.

846
01:00:48,845 --> 01:00:49,834
By God, I am.

847
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:52,403
The papal spy, Riccio,
has bewitched the Queen.

848
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,746
There is talk of their meeting
in his room at night.

849
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:56,182
State business,
they say.

850
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:58,686
They say you are cuckolded,
my lord.

851
01:00:58,755 --> 01:00:59,779
Lies!

852
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:01,983
It is an unnatural thing
for a woman to rule.

853
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:04,720
And it is most unnatural
that the great lords of Scotland

854
01:01:04,794 --> 01:01:08,059
shall sit in council to be lorded over
by the little papist

855
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:09,826
when there is a King
in the land.

856
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:14,461
You mock me. Look, I am not the King.
I am the King consort, a puppet King,

857
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:16,367
shut out from all power.
You know this.

858
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:20,136
We, your loyal subjects,
will make you the true King.

859
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:24,305
We, the Council, will grant you
the crown matrimonial to rule here,

860
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:26,075
to be the first in the land.

861
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:30,449
If this is done, Your Grace,
you will rule even if the Queen is dead.

862
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,250
King Henry the First
of Scotland and the Isles!

863
01:01:33,322 --> 01:01:36,052
Long live the King!
Long live the King!

864
01:01:45,468 --> 01:01:47,527
And what must I do to
gain the prize, my lords?

865
01:01:47,603 --> 01:01:51,596
Embrace the Protestant faith and defend it
against all papists in this land.

866
01:01:51,674 --> 01:01:53,141
The Queen is a papist.

867
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:54,608
All papists.

868
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:06,416
I agree.

869
01:02:09,192 --> 01:02:11,023
We have drawn up this covenant.

870
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:13,119
On our part we pledge you the crown

871
01:02:13,196 --> 01:02:17,895
and that we will pursue and slay and
root out all who oppose this resolution.

872
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:20,060
You will cut Davie's throat?

873
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:22,965
There is no word of killing
in the bond.

874
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:25,166
And if need be you will kill

875
01:02:27,376 --> 01:02:28,900
one other?

876
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:32,039
We have all signed the bond.

877
01:02:32,448 --> 01:02:35,349
And no man among you
dare betray the other.

878
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,447
It is a good Scottish custom.

879
01:02:39,155 --> 01:02:40,554
It lacks one signature.

880
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:43,490
On your part, you will hold
us innocent and defend us,

881
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:46,050
even in the presence
of the Queen herself,

882
01:02:46,129 --> 01:02:48,097
no matter what action
we have to take.

883
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:49,153
Is that all?

884
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:52,167
You will pardon and recall
James Stuart, Earl of Moray.

885
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:53,426
Agreed.

886
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:56,370
Then sign, Your Majesty, and hasten
the great day of your coronation.

887
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,066
On one further condition.

888
01:02:58,141 --> 01:02:59,369
Name it.

889
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:05,204
That you will kill Riccio in her presence
when I am there to see the deed.

890
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:08,083
She must come to no harm

891
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:12,282
before that moment.

892
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:57,153
Is this true?

893
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:59,194
That is a copy
from our ambassador.

894
01:05:00,162 --> 01:05:03,427
Everyone in the Scottish court knows of it,
save the Queen and her Italian.

895
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:04,761
Everyone.

896
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:08,366
And her loving husband
has put his signature and seal to it.

897
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:09,836
He has.

898
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,703
So much for marriage.

899
01:05:12,174 --> 01:05:15,041
The Lord James Stuart is ready
to travel to Scotland.

900
01:05:15,111 --> 01:05:16,635
So?
He must have money

901
01:05:16,712 --> 01:05:17,804
to hold the lords in his payroll.

902
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:18,972
Then let him find it elsewhere.

903
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:22,745
But, Madam, everything that
you hoped for has happened.

904
01:05:22,818 --> 01:05:25,343
Now we must support
our Protestant friends.

905
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:29,016
That is a murder bond drawn up by
treacherous subjects against their queen.

906
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:30,183
Where is my name on it?

907
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:33,660
Where does it say that Elizabeth of
England shall pay the wages of assassins?

908
01:05:33,729 --> 01:05:37,096
Your Grace, it was you
who sent Darnley to Scotland.

909
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:41,034
But the rest was in God's hands.
I leave this to him also. Come, Robin.

910
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:45,597
The lady is with child, a child that
could one day be King of England.

911
01:05:48,577 --> 01:05:52,206
How long must I live under
the shadow of this other queen?

912
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:57,610
I desire her to be without power
but not dead.

913
01:05:58,654 --> 01:06:00,918
By God,
if it were not for policy,

914
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:03,288
I have it in me to ride north
into her very palace

915
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:04,553
and warn her of what is to come.

916
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:08,529
Madam, these Scottish lords
are set upon a certain course.

917
01:06:08,597 --> 01:06:12,124
It is wise for us as it is for them
that they pursue it to the end.

918
01:06:12,201 --> 01:06:15,102
Then let them
find the means elsewhere!

919
01:06:15,871 --> 01:06:17,202
Majesty...

920
01:06:21,577 --> 01:06:26,708
Majesty, if you would but marry
me and bear a child yourself,

921
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:30,348
then her shadow would
be lifted from you.

922
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:38,324
Master Cecil, pay James
Stuart 3,000 crowns in gold

923
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:40,726
and send him home
on a fast horse.

924
01:06:40,796 --> 01:06:44,232
Let the gold coin be of any kind
save that which has my head on it.

925
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:47,463
I will have no knowledge of her death.
See to it!

926
01:06:57,947 --> 01:07:03,647
Almighty God, I thank thee for the endless
ambition of Robert Dudley to be king,

927
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:09,184
and for the many times it has
provoked the queen to wise policy,

928
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:12,823
against her will,
but to Thy glory.

929
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:15,456
Amen.

930
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:26,000
Where are they?

931
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:27,167
In the turret.

932
01:07:33,282 --> 01:07:35,807
Elizabeth is so demanding
of the gentleman's affection

933
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:38,376
he'd never be reconciled
with his own wedded wife

934
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:40,445
for fear the royal anger.

935
01:07:43,292 --> 01:07:44,919
Why are you here?

936
01:07:47,296 --> 01:07:49,059
If it please Your Majesty,

937
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:53,625
let Davie Riccio come out of this privy
chamber where he has hidden too long.

938
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:58,430
It is by my command
that he is here.

939
01:07:58,507 --> 01:08:00,407
He has offended your honor!

940
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:03,411
Your mind is full of fantasies.
You have a fever.

941
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:06,277
Escort Lord Ruthven away
and lock the doors.

942
01:08:06,348 --> 01:08:08,111
Lay not hands on me!

943
01:08:09,285 --> 01:08:12,516
Oh, God! Save the Queen!

944
01:08:12,621 --> 01:08:13,952
Oh, God, Harry.

945
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:15,490
Save me! Save me!

946
01:08:15,558 --> 01:08:17,992
In the name of God,
I'll save you.

947
01:08:20,129 --> 01:08:21,960
Save me!
Oh, my God!

948
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:24,957
No!

949
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:28,069
Riccio! Kill him!

950
01:08:28,137 --> 01:08:31,732
Stop it! Stop it! Stop them!

951
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:10,838
And this is from the King.

952
01:09:12,681 --> 01:09:13,807
Losers!

953
01:09:13,883 --> 01:09:17,148
Oh, no, Your Grace,
speak gently to His Majesty.

954
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:20,848
I will never rest until you have
a heavier heart than I have now.

955
01:09:20,923 --> 01:09:22,220
Be silent!

956
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:25,283
That in my belly will be
revenged on you all!

957
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:26,658
If you live!

958
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:28,424
Silence, my lords!

959
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:31,231
Do not threaten the heir
to Scotland.

960
01:09:32,234 --> 01:09:37,433
He shall be born, but we shall keep
this queen imprisoned from that time.

961
01:09:37,973 --> 01:09:40,032
"Imprisoned from that time"?

962
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:43,306
This good King shall have
the whole government of the realm.

963
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:46,280
The heir, we will bring up to
the Protestant faith,

964
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:49,146
and you shall be our perpetual prisoner.

965
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:59,156
The child!
I believe it is the child.

966
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:01,157
Harry!

967
01:10:03,799 --> 01:10:05,426
Help the Queen to her bed.

968
01:10:05,501 --> 01:10:06,798
Take her gently.

969
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:08,962
Hurry here.
With all care.

970
01:10:13,842 --> 01:10:15,935
My lords,
give us privacy!

971
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:18,711
If the queen is in labor
after these dreadful events

972
01:10:18,781 --> 01:10:20,749
then there must be calm.

973
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:25,444
Come, my lords.

974
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:37,156
I will stay.

975
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:38,666
The palace is guarded.

976
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:42,135
You have chosen your way, Sire,
you must follow it to the end.

977
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:43,728
I have chosen.

978
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:15,135
Forgive me.

979
01:11:19,241 --> 01:11:20,606
Forgive me.

980
01:11:25,214 --> 01:11:28,411
The King is there alone,
but the outer door is guarded.

981
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:31,146
We must escape tonight
or we are lost.

982
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:38,292
And we must take my husband with us or
the lords will use him to seize the Crown.

983
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,918
Madam, how?

984
01:11:39,995 --> 01:11:43,692
I must make that traitor, my husband,
into a double traitor.

985
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:48,068
Find Andrew. If possible,
he could bring us horses.

986
01:11:57,579 --> 01:12:00,047
Be brave.
God will watch over you.

987
01:12:19,702 --> 01:12:20,726
Harry!

988
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:22,270
What's become of your pain?

989
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:23,998
Why are you here?

990
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:28,976
Forgive me, Harry, our child is
still alive, it is not yet time.

991
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:34,244
I have never betrayed you, but I have
wronged you and I beg your forgiveness.

992
01:12:38,721 --> 01:12:40,188
It's too late.

993
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:43,118
No, I swear it is not.

994
01:12:43,258 --> 01:12:46,921
You shall be the King without
being elected by those murderers,

995
01:12:46,995 --> 01:12:49,463
but I'm in terror for you,
Henry.

996
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:53,763
Those murderers will butcher you once
they have our child safe in their keeping.

997
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:55,360
What can I do?

998
01:12:57,339 --> 01:12:58,363
What can I do?

999
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:01,773
Harry, don't be afraid, I know what to do,
I know what to do, trust me.

1000
01:13:02,311 --> 01:13:03,471
Trust me.

1001
01:13:20,696 --> 01:13:21,890
Hurry!

1002
01:13:22,197 --> 01:13:23,528
For God's sake, hurry!

1003
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:26,363
Harry, will you wait? I cannot
go so fast for fear I miscarry.

1004
01:13:26,435 --> 01:13:29,666
Miscarry if you will, we can
make another when we're safe.

1005
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:31,228
Father, Davie...

1006
01:13:31,306 --> 01:13:33,206
I know.
The Lord Bothwell is waiting.

1007
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:35,800
Can you ride a horse, Your Grace?
There's no coach or litter.

1008
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:37,505
Yes, I can ride.

1009
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:49,582
Have we enough horses?

1010
01:13:49,658 --> 01:13:52,183
Aye, Madam,
you shall ride with me.

1011
01:13:52,628 --> 01:13:55,563
It will be safer,
so tuck up your skirts...

1012
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,290
And hurry.

1013
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:03,402
But if we are caught, they will cut us
into collops and feed the dogs by us.

1014
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:04,666
Andrew!

1015
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:04,461
Welcome to Hermitage.

1016
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:06,663
My sanctuary, Madam.

1017
01:15:06,735 --> 01:15:08,498
Thank you, my lord.

1018
01:15:10,405 --> 01:15:11,736
Are you all right?

1019
01:15:11,807 --> 01:15:12,933
Indeed, I am

1020
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:16,410
and in good spirits.
Come, let us go in.

1021
01:15:23,585 --> 01:15:24,950
Who is this lady?

1022
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:29,719
She was the Lady Jean Gordon, Your Grace,
daughter of the richest of Highland lords.

1023
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:30,951
Was?

1024
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:33,051
She is now Lady Bothwell.

1025
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:36,628
Welcome to Hermitage Castle,
Your Majesty.

1026
01:15:37,332 --> 01:15:39,061
You were married.

1027
01:15:39,134 --> 01:15:40,499
Yes, Madam.

1028
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:50,940
Help me,
the child is coming!

1029
01:15:55,517 --> 01:16:00,648
I gave you no permission
to marry, my lord.

1030
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:03,253
Take her in quickly.

1031
01:16:30,018 --> 01:16:31,110
Well?

1032
01:16:31,453 --> 01:16:33,045
Scotland has a new prince.

1033
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:46,732
Oh, no!

1034
01:16:54,843 --> 01:16:58,609
The Queen of Scots is
lighter of a fair son.

1035
01:17:00,382 --> 01:17:03,249
I am but barren stock.

1036
01:17:17,332 --> 01:17:19,323
I kept it from her
as long as I dared,

1037
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:23,701
but the defeat of the Protestant
lords of Scotland forced me to speak.

1038
01:17:24,172 --> 01:17:25,161
They're defeated?

1039
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:26,298
Yes.

1040
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:28,935
Bothwell raised an army
and put them to flight.

1041
01:17:29,011 --> 01:17:32,105
Ruthven, Morton, and Huntly have
come over the border to the sanctuary.

1042
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:33,738
Stuart is under siege
at Dunbar.

1043
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:03,872
Stuart!

1044
01:18:05,914 --> 01:18:06,938
All right?

1045
01:18:07,015 --> 01:18:10,246
Rouse yourself, James,
don't you hear the pipes?

1046
01:18:10,318 --> 01:18:13,344
It's your loving sister come
to put a rope around your neck.

1047
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:31,956
Your Majesty,
the rebels are defeated.

1048
01:19:32,033 --> 01:19:33,694
Dunbar is yours.

1049
01:19:34,169 --> 01:19:36,160
The Queen has triumphed!

1050
01:19:44,379 --> 01:19:46,210
Where is my brother?
Is he dead?

1051
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:49,079
No. I've saved him
for the scaffold.

1052
01:19:49,384 --> 01:19:51,511
Then let him make his will
and say his prayers,

1053
01:19:51,586 --> 01:19:53,486
for I shall hang him
before tonight.

1054
01:19:53,822 --> 01:19:56,916
You cannot hang me
without killing your husband.

1055
01:19:57,058 --> 01:19:59,083
I took no part
in Riccio's death...

1056
01:19:59,161 --> 01:20:00,150
Liar.

1057
01:20:00,228 --> 01:20:01,786
...but your husband was there.

1058
01:20:01,863 --> 01:20:05,094
He signed the murder bond
with the Scottish lords.

1059
01:20:08,203 --> 01:20:09,363
It is a forgery.

1060
01:20:09,437 --> 01:20:10,529
It is a copy.

1061
01:20:10,872 --> 01:20:13,739
The original is
safely hidden in England.

1062
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:16,175
No court will condemn me
without him.

1063
01:20:16,244 --> 01:20:22,114
And even you, great Queen,
cannot act without due process of law.

1064
01:20:22,284 --> 01:20:24,479
Then, by God,
I will act with it.

1065
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:28,387
It will give me great pleasure
to see you both on the same scaffold!

1066
01:20:28,456 --> 01:20:29,889
Bothwell,
let us do it now.

1067
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:32,051
Will you split the kingdom?

1068
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:34,260
Hang the Stuart line?

1069
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:39,460
If you accuse brave Harry,
he will shout from the rooftops

1070
01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:44,231
that your child is Riccio's bastard,
and that you were Riccio's whore.

1071
01:20:44,773 --> 01:20:48,334
And that the killing was
the just execution of a commoner

1072
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:51,675
who had committed high treason
by cuckolding the king.

1073
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,814
No!
We do not need the law!

1074
01:20:53,882 --> 01:20:57,147
Your brother will have died
of his wounds in battle.

1075
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:02,957
No.
For myself I care nothing,

1076
01:21:03,091 --> 01:21:05,321
for the shame I care nothing,

1077
01:21:06,394 --> 01:21:11,024
but I dare not give the heretics of Scotland
and England a case to use against my son.

1078
01:21:11,733 --> 01:21:16,932
And I will not risk his inheritance
even for the pleasure of your death.

1079
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:24,707
Scotsmen, here is your future king,
James VI of Scotland.

1080
01:21:25,647 --> 01:21:28,980
And in good time,
James I of England.

1081
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:41,123
I am the Queen by right of birth
and right of arms.

1082
01:21:41,196 --> 01:21:43,061
And tyranny, I detest.

1083
01:21:43,398 --> 01:21:47,300
I practice the old religion
but I tolerate the new.

1084
01:21:47,969 --> 01:21:50,870
I rule in God's name,
so I rule in justice.

1085
01:21:51,473 --> 01:21:53,873
The better part of justice
is mercy,

1086
01:21:53,942 --> 01:21:58,311
therefore, on this great day of triumph,
I shall be merciful.

1087
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:01,381
I pardon James Stuart,
Earl of Moray.

1088
01:22:09,724 --> 01:22:14,184
Before you all he shall be reconciled
with my husband and Lord Bothwell.

1089
01:22:14,696 --> 01:22:16,561
But I...
He hates me.

1090
01:22:16,631 --> 01:22:18,963
Not as much as he hates me,
Your Grace.

1091
01:22:19,034 --> 01:22:21,867
Put a good face on it,
for policy's sake.

1092
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:23,928
We are deceiving the people.

1093
01:22:24,005 --> 01:22:25,472
Take my hand, sire.

1094
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:27,167
A man who first betrayed
the Queen

1095
01:22:27,242 --> 01:22:30,439
and then betrayed his fellow conspirators
is like a leper...

1096
01:22:30,512 --> 01:22:32,070
Must be glad of a friend.

1097
01:22:32,147 --> 01:22:36,208
So, I will and wait impatiently for the day
when one of you slit the throat of the other.

1098
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:37,546
Or yours.

1099
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:53,899
Leave me go!

1100
01:22:54,869 --> 01:22:58,635
I have had enough!
Everywhere I go I'm shunned!

1101
01:22:58,707 --> 01:23:00,538
People look through me
like I'm a ghost!

1102
01:23:00,608 --> 01:23:03,771
I will not be made to feel
guilty over a scrap of paper.

1103
01:23:03,845 --> 01:23:04,834
To your bed!

1104
01:23:04,913 --> 01:23:05,937
No, Madam.

1105
01:23:06,014 --> 01:23:07,982
I will go to your bed...

1106
01:23:09,484 --> 01:23:12,942
Either that or I'll leave the country.
I shall go to Italy, to the Pope.

1107
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:15,080
He will annul our marriage.

1108
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:17,590
I shall tell him that you were so
eager that you forgot the dispensation

1109
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:19,320
which cousins must
have to marry.

1110
01:23:19,394 --> 01:23:20,383
Villain!

1111
01:23:20,729 --> 01:23:23,323
Annulment will make your son
a bastard!

1112
01:23:23,398 --> 01:23:27,801
I know. I know. And she will do
anything to save her son's inheritance

1113
01:23:28,203 --> 01:23:30,034
as the future King...

1114
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:33,867
So come to bed, sweet wife.

1115
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:35,707
Bothwell!

1116
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:39,478
Leave us!

1117
01:23:41,549 --> 01:23:43,073
And quickly,

1118
01:23:44,185 --> 01:23:46,153
I have a great appetite.

1119
01:23:58,133 --> 01:24:01,330
Oh, for God's sakes,
smile, madam.

1120
01:24:04,806 --> 01:24:06,740
And bring me some wine.

1121
01:24:33,034 --> 01:24:35,059
Even though I disgust you,

1122
01:24:35,603 --> 01:24:38,731
you will love and fondle me

1123
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:41,637
and have me by your side
again as King.

1124
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:45,245
As I mount you,
so shall I mount the throne.

1125
01:25:05,033 --> 01:25:06,159
Have you killed him?

1126
01:25:06,234 --> 01:25:07,326
No...

1127
01:25:08,403 --> 01:25:10,030
I came to do you
that service.

1128
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:11,732
He's drugged.

1129
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,330
He's diseased.

1130
01:25:13,908 --> 01:25:15,000
Diseased?

1131
01:25:22,650 --> 01:25:25,881
Since before the birth of the Prince
he's been vagabonding at night.

1132
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:28,445
He is poxed.
He will rot with it.

1133
01:25:33,394 --> 01:25:35,225
Merciful God!

1134
01:25:39,267 --> 01:25:41,792
An honorable end is
better than this.

1135
01:25:42,403 --> 01:25:46,271
Bring back the lords in exile.
They will bring him to account.

1136
01:26:49,103 --> 01:26:50,434
Once more.

1137
01:27:41,889 --> 01:27:44,915
<i>"I have departed the court
with my Lord Bothwell</i>

1138
01:27:44,993 --> 01:27:46,756
<i>"You will await my return</i>

1139
01:27:46,828 --> 01:27:51,265
<i>"Husband, there are certain lords in
England who have been punished enough,</i>

1140
01:27:51,332 --> 01:27:53,459
<i>"lords who murdered Riccio</i>

1141
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:56,703
<i>"They are therefore pardoned
by the mercy of their Queen</i>

1142
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:59,103
<i>"Soon you shall meet them again"</i>

1143
01:28:06,314 --> 01:28:07,804
I am betrayed.

1144
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:12,185
I brought him home
to lie in Scottish soil.

1145
01:28:12,587 --> 01:28:15,147
On his deathbed,
we swore vengeance.

1146
01:28:15,356 --> 01:28:19,019
So let us decide which of us
will kill the King in combat.

1147
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:20,958
He's sick of the pox.

1148
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:23,992
He cowers in his bed.
He'll not fight.

1149
01:28:24,065 --> 01:28:27,057
Then we'll drag him out and kill him
as we did Riccio.

1150
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:30,195
Nobody cared about the death
of a little foreigner.

1151
01:28:30,271 --> 01:28:33,263
Everyone will care about
the murder of a king.

1152
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:38,874
His Majesty has a house outside
the wall of Edinburgh

1153
01:28:38,946 --> 01:28:41,506
where he took his whores
and his young men.

1154
01:28:41,582 --> 01:28:42,571
Kirk o' Field.

1155
01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:45,619
He plans to murder Mary Stuart
in that house.

1156
01:28:47,488 --> 01:28:50,184
He has filled the cellars
with gunpowder.

1157
01:28:50,258 --> 01:28:52,158
He means to go there
with the Queen

1158
01:28:52,226 --> 01:28:55,491
and make his excuses
to leave her for a few hours.

1159
01:28:55,863 --> 01:28:56,852
And then...

1160
01:28:56,931 --> 01:28:58,023
Blow her up!

1161
01:29:00,702 --> 01:29:05,264
With a choice of knife, gun, poison, or rope,
why would anyone choose gunpowder?

1162
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:08,776
Nobody chooses gunpowder, Stuart,
in these hard times.

1163
01:29:09,544 --> 01:29:14,004
Nevertheless, the cellars
at Kirk o' Field are full

1164
01:29:15,450 --> 01:29:16,781
of gunpowder.

1165
01:29:22,123 --> 01:29:26,992
His Majesty is a notorious drunkard
and fool. Also, he is sick...

1166
01:29:27,495 --> 01:29:32,455
I think that he will bungle his attempt
on the Queen and blow himself up.

1167
01:29:34,969 --> 01:29:36,596
Can you help us?

1168
01:29:38,806 --> 01:29:41,604
Bury your dead.
Leave the rest to me.

1169
01:29:46,514 --> 01:29:48,880
Next he will lord it over us.

1170
01:29:49,917 --> 01:29:52,715
For a while...
A very little while.

1171
01:29:55,823 --> 01:29:58,519
<i>And so we safely arrived
at Kirk o' Field</i>

1172
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:00,918
<i>I have obeyed you, my love,</i>

1173
01:30:00,995 --> 01:30:04,431
<i>because I believe that
he is condemned to death by the pox,</i>

1174
01:30:04,766 --> 01:30:07,132
<i>which is the wrath of God
upon his vile nature</i>

1175
01:30:08,436 --> 01:30:10,904
<i>So what is planned is no sin</i>

1176
01:30:11,472 --> 01:30:13,963
<i>But God forgive me if I do wrong</i>

1177
01:30:15,376 --> 01:30:17,708
<i>And after your divorce
we shall be man and wife</i>

1178
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:21,146
<i>And you shall be no puppet king
but the master</i>

1179
01:30:23,017 --> 01:30:25,281
<i>For the first time I am loved and fulfilled</i>

1180
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:30,691
<i>I have turned my back on God for you
So be true to me, my love, be true</i>

1181
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:35,392
Andrew?
My lord.

1182
01:30:35,463 --> 01:30:37,931
Get ready.
We leave for Edinburgh.

1183
01:30:38,032 --> 01:30:39,192
There is work for you to do.

1184
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:40,757
Aye, my lord.

1185
01:31:23,744 --> 01:31:25,371
It is time to leave,
Your Grace.

1186
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:27,477
You promised to stay.

1187
01:31:28,549 --> 01:31:32,280
It is Fleming's marriage feast,
so I must go. I will return.

1188
01:31:35,356 --> 01:31:38,621
Why'd you keep Davie's guitar.
Why'd you play it?

1189
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:41,391
Is it to anger me once more?

1190
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:44,954
No, Harry. But I never forget
those who are loyal to me.

1191
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:49,167
Davie is dead.
Let him go.

1192
01:31:49,337 --> 01:31:52,864
Yes, it is just a year.

1193
01:34:23,591 --> 01:34:25,218
Pity me, kinsmen.

1194
01:34:26,627 --> 01:34:28,857
For the sake of Jesus Christ.

1195
01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:30,119
Pity me!

1196
01:34:47,682 --> 01:34:50,116
He was to have an honorable death,
to be challenged to a duel.

1197
01:34:50,184 --> 01:34:51,651
You told me so.
I would...

1198
01:34:51,719 --> 01:34:54,051
Death is death however it comes.

1199
01:34:56,123 --> 01:34:58,250
Now we must look to our future.

1200
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:02,757
The Ambassadors of France
and Spain, Your Majesty.

1201
01:35:03,864 --> 01:35:06,697
And of Scotland.

1202
01:35:15,876 --> 01:35:19,004
We are mourning
the late King Henry of Scotland.

1203
01:35:20,448 --> 01:35:23,383
We mourn because the Scottish Court
does not.

1204
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:27,020
He was once our subject.

1205
01:35:27,822 --> 01:35:30,484
We are shocked
at his abominable murder.

1206
01:35:31,125 --> 01:35:33,525
We are astounded
at what followed.

1207
01:35:35,162 --> 01:35:38,893
The King was taken at dead of night
and buried without ceremony.

1208
01:35:39,166 --> 01:35:43,728
His clothes, his goods, his horse
and his armor were given to Lord Bothwell.

1209
01:35:44,638 --> 01:35:47,607
Voices cry out
that Bothwell is the murderer.

1210
01:35:48,476 --> 01:35:50,637
The Scots have risen in rebellion.

1211
01:35:50,711 --> 01:35:56,240
Catholic and Protestant, lord and peasant,
combine to destroy the tyrant Bothwell.

1212
01:35:56,617 --> 01:36:01,645
And yet Queen Mary Stuart
has married him.

1213
01:36:06,660 --> 01:36:09,925
It was once said
in Catholic courts

1214
01:36:09,997 --> 01:36:15,025
that Elizabeth would marry her horse master
who had murdered his wife.

1215
01:36:15,236 --> 01:36:18,535
Then her people would
turn her out in favor of Mary.

1216
01:36:19,974 --> 01:36:23,171
I have not married.
Leicester is innocent.

1217
01:36:24,145 --> 01:36:29,344
My people did not rebel
and Mary Stuart does not rule here.

1218
01:36:32,386 --> 01:36:36,288
Tell your masters, do not
interfere in Scotland nor will I.

1219
01:36:37,024 --> 01:36:41,222
Let the Scottish Queen settle her
own affairs as I once settled mine.

1220
01:36:44,965 --> 01:36:47,593
How she longs to
hear of Mary's death.

1221
01:36:49,136 --> 01:36:50,933
And how she dreads it.

1222
01:37:01,415 --> 01:37:03,178
No, no, no.

1223
01:37:03,250 --> 01:37:04,512
What is it?

1224
01:37:11,058 --> 01:37:12,320
A dream.

1225
01:37:12,793 --> 01:37:14,055
A dream.

1226
01:37:15,029 --> 01:37:17,623
Be thankful it is not James Stuart
knocking on the door.

1227
01:37:17,765 --> 01:37:20,427
I am full of fears
waking and sleeping.

1228
01:37:21,202 --> 01:37:23,534
All my forces will
be here by day.

1229
01:37:24,038 --> 01:37:27,804
I sent the messengers three days ago.
Do not be afraid.

1230
01:37:32,179 --> 01:37:35,671
It's all right. It's my
Borderers. It is dawn.

1231
01:37:57,838 --> 01:37:59,499
They're all round us.

1232
01:38:01,642 --> 01:38:03,837
We can hold them
till my men come.

1233
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:11,415
Bothwell. Bothwell!
Show yourself, or are you afraid?

1234
01:38:12,853 --> 01:38:14,718
I will speak with him.

1235
01:38:26,433 --> 01:38:28,230
I am here, Stuart.

1236
01:38:28,302 --> 01:38:32,295
Tell Her Majesty to come down to us.
We have no quarrel with her.

1237
01:38:32,539 --> 01:38:33,801
It is you we have come for.

1238
01:38:33,908 --> 01:38:35,569
I will not go down.

1239
01:38:35,676 --> 01:38:38,839
Bothwell, have you the courage
for single combat?

1240
01:38:39,546 --> 01:38:42,879
Or will you go on hiding
in the skirts of the Queen?

1241
01:38:43,484 --> 01:38:46,078
I am not a sick man
like the King you murdered.

1242
01:38:46,153 --> 01:38:47,620
I will cut him to pieces.

1243
01:38:47,688 --> 01:38:49,383
No, I will not let you go.

1244
01:38:49,456 --> 01:38:51,515
I will not be shamed, Mary.

1245
01:38:52,192 --> 01:38:58,392
Our forces will be here within an hour and
then I will see you hanged from these walls.

1246
01:38:58,465 --> 01:39:00,695
You waste your breath. Roy!

1247
01:39:05,506 --> 01:39:07,474
There are your messengers.

1248
01:39:08,542 --> 01:39:09,839
Come now and fight.

1249
01:39:09,910 --> 01:39:11,309
That I will.

1250
01:39:12,446 --> 01:39:15,347
Andrew!
Andrew, bring my armor.

1251
01:39:15,416 --> 01:39:18,943
And when he comes down,
we will cut his throat.

1252
01:39:25,125 --> 01:39:29,858
Jamie, you must not go down.
They will kill you as they killed Davie.

1253
01:39:29,997 --> 01:39:32,693
I will fight.
I will finish it this time.

1254
01:39:33,434 --> 01:39:36,801
When I go down you must leave
by the secret way out of here.

1255
01:39:36,870 --> 01:39:38,735
No.
It leads beyond the castle ground.

1256
01:39:38,839 --> 01:39:39,965
Andrew will guide you.

1257
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:42,235
No. Let us go together. I
beg you. You will not be seen.

1258
01:39:42,309 --> 01:39:44,300
I will not be dishonored.

1259
01:39:47,815 --> 01:39:50,875
My dear love, who remembers
the honor of the dead?

1260
01:39:52,019 --> 01:39:54,453
You are no match
for the treachery of these times.

1261
01:39:59,026 --> 01:40:00,493
Seton! Seton!

1262
01:40:02,596 --> 01:40:05,690
Mary. I beg you,
do not disgrace me.

1263
01:40:05,799 --> 01:40:09,098
Listen to me. Your death
will be mine. You must escape.

1264
01:40:09,169 --> 01:40:13,799
Rouse the Borderers yourself. I am
still the Queen. While I live I reign.

1265
01:40:13,874 --> 01:40:15,171
Do not do this.

1266
01:40:15,242 --> 01:40:17,437
Goodbye, my dear love.
Go now.

1267
01:40:23,217 --> 01:40:27,051
Give me courage. Come with me
and look down on those traitors.

1268
01:40:27,755 --> 01:40:30,781
Soon we must open the gates
and give ourselves up to them.

1269
01:40:33,260 --> 01:40:34,659
God help us.

1270
01:40:39,199 --> 01:40:41,895
I shall watch the combat
from here, brother.

1271
01:40:42,036 --> 01:40:44,800
You shall not wait long.
My husband is determined.

1272
01:40:44,872 --> 01:40:46,737
I cannot dissuade him.

1273
01:40:59,820 --> 01:41:03,756
The Deed of your Abdication.

1274
01:41:04,925 --> 01:41:07,018
It is the will of the lords

1275
01:41:08,929 --> 01:41:10,590
and of the people

1276
01:41:11,799 --> 01:41:13,494
that you sign it.

1277
01:41:13,700 --> 01:41:17,602
I will never abdicate. I am
the Queen. I will die the Queen.

1278
01:41:19,673 --> 01:41:20,662
Huntly.

1279
01:41:23,277 --> 01:41:27,407
In this casket are your letters
to Lord Bothwell

1280
01:41:28,048 --> 01:41:32,644
which prove that you are a murderess
and that you led the King to his death.

1281
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:36,956
Abdicate or I will publish them
and have you tried for murder.

1282
01:41:38,125 --> 01:41:39,114
No.

1283
01:41:39,259 --> 01:41:42,524
The Lord Bothwell will not
be coming to your aid, lady.

1284
01:41:42,696 --> 01:41:44,994
He did not escape.
I have him.

1285
01:41:48,702 --> 01:41:50,226
It's not true.

1286
01:41:50,704 --> 01:41:54,401
Tomorrow I shall hang him.

1287
01:41:55,342 --> 01:41:58,436
No. No. No.

1288
01:42:00,247 --> 01:42:02,875
No. No. No.

1289
01:42:17,865 --> 01:42:19,856
Will you sign
the Deed of Abdication?

1290
01:42:20,367 --> 01:42:21,629
Never!

1291
01:42:45,826 --> 01:42:49,284
Jamie! Jamie!

1292
01:42:49,363 --> 01:42:50,352
Mary, my love.

1293
01:42:50,430 --> 01:42:51,920
Jamie.

1294
01:42:52,933 --> 01:42:54,264
Jamie.

1295
01:42:54,735 --> 01:42:57,966
I thought you were dead.
They told me you were dead.

1296
01:42:58,038 --> 01:42:59,027
No.

1297
01:43:00,507 --> 01:43:03,840
Your brother saw an advantage in
keeping me in this world for a further time.

1298
01:43:05,445 --> 01:43:09,745
They will pardon me, spare you,
give me a passage to Denmark.

1299
01:43:11,018 --> 01:43:14,010
If I can persuade you
to abdicate.

1300
01:43:14,087 --> 01:43:15,111
Oh, Jamie.

1301
01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:18,818
Now listen to me, Mary.
I'm an ambitious man hungry for life,

1302
01:43:18,892 --> 01:43:20,860
but I do not fear death.

1303
01:43:21,161 --> 01:43:23,857
The only thing I fear
is what can happen to you.

1304
01:43:23,964 --> 01:43:26,524
The Scottish lords demand
your trial and execution.

1305
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:30,092
Your brother wants you out of the
way alive before it is too late.

1306
01:43:30,237 --> 01:43:31,898
He lies. He wants me dead, too.

1307
01:43:31,972 --> 01:43:35,464
No. Above all, he's a Stuart.
He'll save you if he can.

1308
01:43:37,211 --> 01:43:41,045
If you abdicate, he'll see
you safe to the English border.

1309
01:43:43,217 --> 01:43:46,709
Our deaths or separate exile.
Jamie, there's no choice.

1310
01:43:47,521 --> 01:43:50,979
I can't exist without you.
I cry for death.

1311
01:43:51,058 --> 01:43:52,150
No.

1312
01:43:53,427 --> 01:43:57,659
You are Mary Stuart, the Queen.
Remember what you said to me.

1313
01:43:58,432 --> 01:44:03,768
"While you live, there is hope."
Cling to that. We shall not be separated.

1314
01:44:04,705 --> 01:44:06,866
One day I shall return
for you with an army.

1315
01:44:08,809 --> 01:44:10,436
Until then, my love,

1316
01:44:12,646 --> 01:44:15,274
I hold you close to my heart.

1317
01:44:20,621 --> 01:44:21,815
Well?

1318
01:44:22,522 --> 01:44:24,490
Death or exile?

1319
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:42,708
The English border is
two miles from here.

1320
01:44:43,076 --> 01:44:45,977
I bid you farewell.
We shall not meet again.

1321
01:44:46,346 --> 01:44:47,938
So you must hope.

1322
01:44:48,315 --> 01:44:52,684
Long life, sister. We will bring
up your son a good Protestant.

1323
01:45:02,963 --> 01:45:05,796
My son, my son,
God help him.

1324
01:45:12,072 --> 01:45:17,772
Seton, in this little time until we reach
the English border we are quite free.

1325
01:45:18,679 --> 01:45:21,614
Free. How it eases the heart.

1326
01:45:22,482 --> 01:45:23,915
And I have good hopes.

1327
01:45:23,984 --> 01:45:27,385
I shall overcome all and
be united with my Bothwell.

1328
01:45:28,488 --> 01:45:33,152
I am but five and twenty years of age.
I have my whole life before me.

1329
01:45:33,226 --> 01:45:35,217
Free! Free!

1330
01:45:52,579 --> 01:45:55,047
God help us if Cecil finds out
about this.

1331
01:45:55,115 --> 01:45:57,106
Do not fear, madam,
no one will find out.

1332
01:45:58,018 --> 01:46:00,782
The Catholics of the North have
flocked to pay her homage

1333
01:46:00,854 --> 01:46:01,980
since she came
over the border.

1334
01:46:02,055 --> 01:46:03,613
At Carlisle she held Court even.

1335
01:46:03,690 --> 01:46:05,954
Is she mad to behave
so blatantly?

1336
01:46:06,026 --> 01:46:07,960
I feel I may have misjudged her
all these years.

1337
01:46:08,028 --> 01:46:09,393
She has never learnt discretion.

1338
01:46:09,463 --> 01:46:12,159
Well, is it discretion for me
to meet her in secret?

1339
01:46:12,232 --> 01:46:13,790
It is imperative.

1340
01:46:14,201 --> 01:46:16,567
It's said you have
a wolf by the ears, madam.

1341
01:46:22,809 --> 01:46:25,403
Well, let us
look at the animal.

1342
01:46:31,818 --> 01:46:33,251
Stay here!

1343
01:46:45,932 --> 01:46:47,263
Sweet cousin.

1344
01:46:47,367 --> 01:46:49,267
Dear sister and cousin.

1345
01:46:52,406 --> 01:46:55,637
I am here to meet you
as you so urgently demanded.

1346
01:46:57,377 --> 01:47:01,108
My business can only be
discussed between us face to face.

1347
01:47:01,181 --> 01:47:04,446
I know you to be the enemy of all rebels
against their rightful prince.

1348
01:47:04,518 --> 01:47:06,213
Indeed, madam,
you are right.

1349
01:47:07,254 --> 01:47:09,381
The crime of my lords
against their anointed queen

1350
01:47:09,456 --> 01:47:12,289
is so great it buries all past differences
between us.

1351
01:47:12,359 --> 01:47:14,884
I am confident of your help.
I ask it as a right.

1352
01:47:14,961 --> 01:47:17,122
I see that
you have courage.

1353
01:47:17,197 --> 01:47:19,893
And I see that you are the great Queen
of whom all speak.

1354
01:47:19,966 --> 01:47:21,297
And you are young.

1355
01:47:21,368 --> 01:47:23,529
Not too young to ride
at the head of an army.

1356
01:47:23,603 --> 01:47:25,366
You have come to
ask me for an army?

1357
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:27,373
Yes, an army,
supplies, money.

1358
01:47:27,441 --> 01:47:28,499
And money?

1359
01:47:28,575 --> 01:47:33,012
Which I shall most happily repay to
you when I reign once again in Scotland.

1360
01:47:33,079 --> 01:47:35,741
How else may I aid you?
Be open with me, dear cousin.

1361
01:47:35,816 --> 01:47:37,784
For be assured there is
no waking hour in my day

1362
01:47:37,851 --> 01:47:39,546
when you are
far from my thoughts.

1363
01:47:39,619 --> 01:47:41,519
Your fate is
linked with mine.

1364
01:47:41,588 --> 01:47:44,148
We are princes both.
We are joined by blood.

1365
01:47:44,224 --> 01:47:47,159
What else have you to tell me
or to ask of me?

1366
01:47:47,561 --> 01:47:49,153
Nothing.
Nothing?

1367
01:47:49,796 --> 01:47:51,229
Why? What else could there be?

1368
01:47:51,298 --> 01:47:54,563
Some helpful word concerning
the murder of Lord Darnley.

1369
01:47:55,769 --> 01:47:57,293
Yes, of course.

1370
01:47:58,472 --> 01:48:02,033
Rest assured, Elizabeth, that
I am innocent in the matter.

1371
01:48:02,709 --> 01:48:04,677
That gives me great joy.

1372
01:48:05,312 --> 01:48:08,406
For when you are honorably acquitted
of the crime of which you are accused

1373
01:48:08,482 --> 01:48:11,508
then you shall have your army
and your money.

1374
01:48:11,585 --> 01:48:12,745
Cousin,

1375
01:48:12,819 --> 01:48:15,515
put it out of your mind that I came
to England merely to save my life.

1376
01:48:15,589 --> 01:48:17,318
I came to recover my honor.

1377
01:48:17,424 --> 01:48:19,255
If you dare to doubt my word
that I am innocent,

1378
01:48:19,326 --> 01:48:21,089
then I will go at once
to France.

1379
01:48:21,161 --> 01:48:22,423
You shall not.

1380
01:48:22,496 --> 01:48:26,728
Madam, in the past you have sheltered those
very traitors who now rule in Scotland.

1381
01:48:26,900 --> 01:48:29,562
They entered freely into England,
just as freely they returned.

1382
01:48:29,703 --> 01:48:31,568
Do you offer me less
than my treacherous subjects?

1383
01:48:31,638 --> 01:48:34,505
Am I your prisoner?
If so, by what law?

1384
01:48:34,574 --> 01:48:37,407
If you forbid me to go to France,
what will you do with me?

1385
01:48:37,577 --> 01:48:40,876
I shall take you deeper into
England for your protection.

1386
01:48:42,082 --> 01:48:43,572
Then I am your prisoner.

1387
01:48:43,650 --> 01:48:46,483
If you are innocent,
what have you to fear?

1388
01:48:46,553 --> 01:48:50,114
You have deceived me. You
are in league with my brother.

1389
01:48:50,624 --> 01:48:51,989
I will answer no accusations.

1390
01:48:52,058 --> 01:48:53,821
Who is there who may try me?
Who is my equal?

1391
01:48:53,894 --> 01:48:57,227
Will you do it? In public
before the eyes of the world? No.

1392
01:48:57,297 --> 01:49:00,130
You lack the courage.
You hope to dishonor me.

1393
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:01,929
It is you who are dishonored.

1394
01:49:02,002 --> 01:49:06,063
Did you believe I would send you back
to Scotland at the head of a great army?

1395
01:49:06,139 --> 01:49:10,200
Did you believe I would sacrifice
my reputation on your behalf?

1396
01:49:10,277 --> 01:49:13,872
It is not enough, madam, to speak
one's mind in season and out as you do.

1397
01:49:13,947 --> 01:49:15,778
That is not the conduct
of a Queen.

1398
01:49:15,849 --> 01:49:19,307
It is the outpouring of a pampered
woman demanding that all indulge her.

1399
01:49:19,386 --> 01:49:22,913
It does not surprise me that you are
here helpless and that your brother rules.

1400
01:49:22,989 --> 01:49:25,890
You are not fit for the high office
to which you were born.

1401
01:49:25,959 --> 01:49:28,894
And you, madam, who hate me
and wish me dead and fear to kill me,

1402
01:49:28,962 --> 01:49:30,293
you are my mortal enemy.

1403
01:49:30,363 --> 01:49:32,695
I have noted since the day you denied me
a passport through England

1404
01:49:32,766 --> 01:49:34,393
all the blows you have
struck against me.

1405
01:49:34,467 --> 01:49:36,298
I glory in your hatred.

1406
01:49:36,369 --> 01:49:38,166
For it is clear to me
that Elizabeth, the bastard,

1407
01:49:38,238 --> 01:49:41,036
the heretic, the usurper,
is cursed by God,

1408
01:49:41,107 --> 01:49:44,702
and will soon be too old to bear a child
and will die a solitary old woman.

1409
01:49:44,778 --> 01:49:47,804
Above all it is clear
that Elizabeth fears Mary.

1410
01:49:48,348 --> 01:49:51,647
And whatever my fate,
my son will rule here in time.

1411
01:49:58,258 --> 01:50:01,455
You have noted all the blows
I struck against you.

1412
01:50:01,528 --> 01:50:02,517
AII.

1413
01:50:02,596 --> 01:50:04,086
All save one.

1414
01:50:04,164 --> 01:50:08,362
It was I who sent Henry, Lord Darnley
to your court, sweet cousin.

1415
01:50:08,435 --> 01:50:09,561
Darnley?

1416
01:50:09,636 --> 01:50:12,764
Any Queen who could be guiled
by such a pretty, wicked fellow

1417
01:50:12,839 --> 01:50:15,273
and take him to her bed,
and put a crown upon his head,

1418
01:50:15,342 --> 01:50:19,039
does not inspire fear.
She inspires pity.

1419
01:50:19,112 --> 01:50:23,208
You have my pity, madam, as you had
it on the day I sent Darnley north,

1420
01:50:23,283 --> 01:50:25,012
knowing you to be
without wisdom, discretion

1421
01:50:25,118 --> 01:50:27,211
or any of the attributes
of a Queen.

1422
01:50:27,287 --> 01:50:29,448
I see you have
learned nothing since.

1423
01:50:29,522 --> 01:50:32,423
It is not surprising that you are
spoken of in the courts of Europe

1424
01:50:32,492 --> 01:50:34,517
as an infamous royal whore.

1425
01:50:34,594 --> 01:50:35,754
Madam.

1426
01:50:36,363 --> 01:50:38,797
My lord, I urge you to
guard your mistress well

1427
01:50:38,865 --> 01:50:41,698
for there are many
who would wish her dead.

1428
01:50:45,138 --> 01:50:46,935
Now I have no choice.

1429
01:50:47,774 --> 01:50:50,106
I must keep her prisoner
until the day of her death.

1430
01:50:51,745 --> 01:50:53,235
May it be soon.

1431
01:52:05,251 --> 01:52:08,015
Madam, there is an English officer
from the French court to see you.

1432
01:52:09,756 --> 01:52:10,814
Yes.

1433
01:52:13,059 --> 01:52:14,253
Sir.

1434
01:52:18,832 --> 01:52:21,426
I bring you greetings, madam,
and some letters which, I must tell you,

1435
01:52:21,501 --> 01:52:24,470
I have already shown to the authorities
here, for I am a loyal Englishman.

1436
01:52:24,537 --> 01:52:25,697
Very well.
Leave them.

1437
01:52:25,772 --> 01:52:28,741
No, ma'am. I'm ordered
to wait for your reply.

1438
01:52:35,482 --> 01:52:39,646
No need to waste time on these,
Your Grace.

1439
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:42,244
Father Ballard!

1440
01:52:46,326 --> 01:52:49,261
Up, Your Grace. There is work
to do, work of great danger.

1441
01:52:49,329 --> 01:52:51,490
Mistress Seton, do put an ear to
the door and give us good warning.

1442
01:52:51,564 --> 01:52:52,622
Aye, Father.

1443
01:52:55,502 --> 01:52:58,665
This is from King Philip himself.
He has a new plan against Elizabeth.

1444
01:52:58,738 --> 01:52:59,762
Another?

1445
01:52:59,839 --> 01:53:02,273
We've been shut up for years
and no help from him.

1446
01:53:02,342 --> 01:53:04,902
This one is different.
Read the letter, madam.

1447
01:53:05,745 --> 01:53:06,769
Very well.

1448
01:53:06,946 --> 01:53:10,848
What news have you from Scotland?
How is my dear son, James?

1449
01:53:12,852 --> 01:53:15,582
I have written to him ever since
I judged him able to read,

1450
01:53:15,655 --> 01:53:17,714
but not one reply
in all these years.

1451
01:53:17,924 --> 01:53:21,223
He is well enough to write regularly
and cordially to Elizabeth.

1452
01:53:24,230 --> 01:53:27,131
Well, he is his father's son,
after all.

1453
01:53:27,567 --> 01:53:29,262
The letter, Your Grace.
Read it quickly.

1454
01:53:32,238 --> 01:53:33,603
Just one more question.

1455
01:53:39,813 --> 01:53:42,873
Have you any news of my husband,
Lord Bothwell?

1456
01:53:44,317 --> 01:53:47,582
Lord Bothwell has died,
insane, in a Danish prison.

1457
01:53:55,061 --> 01:53:56,961
Oh, Father.

1458
01:54:01,634 --> 01:54:06,298
Now I do repent of all my actions that
have brought him to this terrible end.

1459
01:54:07,106 --> 01:54:11,099
Then will I hear your confession,
my sovereign lady?

1460
01:54:14,414 --> 01:54:16,939
Yes, Father Ballard,
it is time.

1461
01:54:25,358 --> 01:54:27,986
We need safeguards.
The risk is great.

1462
01:54:29,662 --> 01:54:33,496
It follows the pattern of similar plots,
similar to the one in Northumberland.

1463
01:54:34,667 --> 01:54:38,694
It would be sensible, madam,
to order her immediate execution.

1464
01:54:39,372 --> 01:54:41,897
No. I will not
have Mary killed.

1465
01:54:43,009 --> 01:54:44,567
Why am I driven to bloodshed?

1466
01:54:44,644 --> 01:54:47,670
In all the years of my reign
the scaffold has rotted from disuse.

1467
01:54:47,747 --> 01:54:49,874
Until Mary came
into England.

1468
01:54:50,383 --> 01:54:51,645
Leave us!

1469
01:54:56,089 --> 01:54:58,614
Madam, I beg you,
open your eyes.

1470
01:54:59,425 --> 01:55:02,690
Since the Pope has excommunicated you
for keeping Mary prisoner,

1471
01:55:02,762 --> 01:55:05,162
your Catholic subjects have
been torn in two.

1472
01:55:05,231 --> 01:55:07,825
Whom should they serve,
Pope or Queen?

1473
01:55:08,468 --> 01:55:10,527
They risk the block in this world
if they rebel

1474
01:55:10,603 --> 01:55:12,798
and Hell in the next
if they do not.

1475
01:55:12,872 --> 01:55:18,105
Keep this fact always before you.
It is now no sin to kill you.

1476
01:55:19,012 --> 01:55:21,446
To the Catholics
it is the act of a Saint.

1477
01:55:22,148 --> 01:55:24,207
I am ill.
I will hear no more.

1478
01:55:24,284 --> 01:55:27,481
Destroy Mary,
and all problems wither away.

1479
01:55:27,553 --> 01:55:28,577
No.

1480
01:55:29,555 --> 01:55:33,924
I fear her execution. It threatens me.
She is an anointed Queen as I am.

1481
01:55:34,794 --> 01:55:37,388
If I bring you proof
that she plots to kill you?

1482
01:55:37,463 --> 01:55:39,954
No. Written proof. Irrefutable proof.

1483
01:55:41,567 --> 01:55:43,125
Is there such proof?

1484
01:55:44,203 --> 01:55:45,693
There will be.

1485
01:55:50,743 --> 01:55:51,937
William!

1486
01:55:52,745 --> 01:55:57,409
No forgeries. The evidence must stand
up before the people and the parliament.

1487
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:04,120
It has always been, from the
beginning, her death or mine.

1488
01:56:14,634 --> 01:56:17,296
No, Walsingham, that priest
will die before he speaks.

1489
01:56:17,837 --> 01:56:22,638
We have the rest, Babbington, Tichbourne,
Charnock, Gerrard. We have them all.

1490
01:56:23,209 --> 01:56:24,676
It was a great conspiracy.

1491
01:56:24,744 --> 01:56:29,181
But the absolute proof that Mary is
personally involved we do not have.

1492
01:56:29,849 --> 01:56:31,373
You are wrong.

1493
01:56:37,724 --> 01:56:40,124
This good fellow is
from Spain.

1494
01:56:40,193 --> 01:56:44,459
We caught him with Ballard, but he
carried a letter in Mary's own hand.

1495
01:56:45,064 --> 01:56:49,228
She endorses the murder of Elizabeth
as the main spring of the plot.

1496
01:56:52,205 --> 01:56:53,797
Now we have her.

1497
01:57:14,027 --> 01:57:16,120
"To His Holiness,
the Pope."

1498
01:57:19,465 --> 01:57:21,729
"From King Philip of Spain."

1499
01:57:25,204 --> 01:57:28,867
"From an English gentleman."

1500
01:57:33,112 --> 01:57:34,511
And another.

1501
01:57:39,085 --> 01:57:40,347
And yet another.

1502
01:57:40,420 --> 01:57:45,551
Madam, you cast an evil spell
on all you meet. Save me.

1503
01:57:46,893 --> 01:57:48,383
And now, my lord?

1504
01:57:48,461 --> 01:57:51,225
It has taken me years
to trap you, madam.

1505
01:57:52,031 --> 01:57:53,965
Now you will come to justice.

1506
01:58:04,610 --> 01:58:07,238
No matter the evidence,
I fear a terrible retribution

1507
01:58:07,313 --> 01:58:09,144
if I sign her death warrant.

1508
01:58:09,215 --> 01:58:12,912
Your Grace, until you decide,
she must be shut away

1509
01:58:13,019 --> 01:58:15,317
where no more traitors can reach her.

1510
01:58:16,589 --> 01:58:17,578
Where will you send her?

1511
01:58:17,657 --> 01:58:19,284
Fotheringhay Castle.

1512
01:58:19,358 --> 01:58:21,121
Jeez you, that evil place.

1513
01:58:22,662 --> 01:58:24,027
My heart goes out to her.

1514
01:58:24,097 --> 01:58:26,156
I have brought you
proof positive.

1515
01:58:30,803 --> 01:58:33,829
If she begs forgiveness of me,
she shall live.

1516
01:58:45,952 --> 01:58:49,115
Fotheringhay.
Am I to be murdered here?

1517
01:59:30,229 --> 01:59:33,960
As you see, despite your
efforts, I am not dead.

1518
01:59:38,137 --> 01:59:40,037
Forgive me, I must sit.

1519
01:59:40,740 --> 01:59:42,537
The bitter winters
of my imprisonment

1520
01:59:42,608 --> 01:59:47,011
and the damp that runs down
English walls has entered my bones.

1521
01:59:50,850 --> 01:59:55,685
My council, my parliament
and my people

1522
01:59:55,821 --> 01:59:59,450
demand that I bring you
to trial.

1523
02:00:02,128 --> 02:00:05,962
Like your father to your mother,
will you permit me the sword

1524
02:00:06,666 --> 02:00:08,861
and spare me the dull axe?

1525
02:00:09,735 --> 02:00:11,362
Madam, do not play with me.

1526
02:00:11,437 --> 02:00:12,768
From the moment
of your imprisonment

1527
02:00:12,838 --> 02:00:14,669
I have lived in constant fear
of assassination.

1528
02:00:14,740 --> 02:00:17,072
Your assassins, madam,
your followers.

1529
02:00:17,143 --> 02:00:19,805
I have forced myself to walk in
the open freely among my people,

1530
02:00:19,879 --> 02:00:23,178
and I have never known at which moment
the pistol or the dagger will do its work.

1531
02:00:23,249 --> 02:00:25,774
So make no jokes with me
about death.

1532
02:00:25,851 --> 02:00:29,014
I'm very tired. Tell me
what you want and then go.

1533
02:00:33,826 --> 02:00:35,817
I want to spare you,

1534
02:00:36,862 --> 02:00:38,955
but you must beg my forgiveness.

1535
02:00:39,031 --> 02:00:43,195
You must write it now while I am
here. Then I will forbid the trial.

1536
02:00:43,769 --> 02:00:44,861
Yes.

1537
02:00:46,272 --> 02:00:50,800
I knew of the plans for your
death. I was glad of them,

1538
02:00:57,049 --> 02:01:00,041
but now in this room, as
I look at you, face to face

1539
02:01:02,421 --> 02:01:04,150
it is another matter.

1540
02:01:04,857 --> 02:01:06,984
I am glad
you have been spared.

1541
02:01:07,660 --> 02:01:11,494
I will be happy to ask your forgiveness
here between these four walls.

1542
02:01:11,564 --> 02:01:13,759
That is not enough. Write it.

1543
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:18,369
No. It would damn me forever
in the eyes of posterity.

1544
02:01:18,437 --> 02:01:22,168
I will keep the letter quite secret
from all save my Chief Minister.

1545
02:01:22,842 --> 02:01:25,208
I am offering you your life.

1546
02:01:25,278 --> 02:01:28,270
I long for the trial. I long
to stand before the world

1547
02:01:28,347 --> 02:01:31,043
after these years of darkness
and defend myself.

1548
02:01:31,117 --> 02:01:35,110
I thank God in his mercy and
wisdom he has brought me to it.

1549
02:01:36,122 --> 02:01:40,058
I shall die a martyr to the Catholic faith,
which is the true and eternal faith.

1550
02:01:40,126 --> 02:01:41,957
Nothing can prevent it.

1551
02:01:42,061 --> 02:01:47,624
No man is my judge. Not even you,
madam, may judge me now, only God.

1552
02:01:49,001 --> 02:01:51,333
How little you have changed.

1553
02:01:52,071 --> 02:01:54,801
How wildly you rush to your destruction.

1554
02:02:01,547 --> 02:02:03,572
Your letters to Bothwell, madam.

1555
02:02:03,649 --> 02:02:07,415
Will you appear a noble Catholic martyr
when these are read to the Court?

1556
02:02:07,853 --> 02:02:09,343
What will the world think when,

1557
02:02:09,422 --> 02:02:12,983
after the details of the plots
to murder me are revealed,

1558
02:02:13,059 --> 02:02:14,822
we turn to the past?

1559
02:02:15,194 --> 02:02:18,254
Your life is steeped in blood
and violence.

1560
02:02:18,931 --> 02:02:22,833
The actions which led to your disgusting
marriage to the murderer Bothwell

1561
02:02:22,902 --> 02:02:26,736
will be fully recounted before
the Court and before the world.

1562
02:02:28,007 --> 02:02:32,239
Your absurd love letters will be read out
for the people to gloat upon.

1563
02:02:32,311 --> 02:02:36,873
Will all this evidence of treachery, cruelty
and lust rise like a hymn of praise to God,

1564
02:02:36,982 --> 02:02:39,382
or will it cast you down forever?

1565
02:02:39,919 --> 02:02:41,147
Oh, God!

1566
02:02:41,420 --> 02:02:46,255
Write one short page to me and I will
spare you the trial and you will live.

1567
02:02:47,693 --> 02:02:51,026
For the first time in your life
put aside your personal desires

1568
02:02:51,097 --> 02:02:52,587
and behave like a Queen.

1569
02:02:52,665 --> 02:02:57,295
Think of your son who will one day rule
these two kingdoms, and do as I say.

1570
02:03:10,616 --> 02:03:15,076
No. You cannot tempt me. You are
the devil. I will not succumb to you.

1571
02:03:16,222 --> 02:03:17,484
Jeez you.

1572
02:03:21,394 --> 02:03:24,659
In all my early years
I was misled and betrayed.

1573
02:03:24,730 --> 02:03:27,893
I sinned most grievously.
I lost my faith.

1574
02:03:27,967 --> 02:03:33,132
I will deny nothing to you here in this
room, madam, for I have repented of it all.

1575
02:03:33,205 --> 02:03:35,673
I have made my peace
with God.

1576
02:03:36,409 --> 02:03:40,311
I begged him that I might atone
for all that has gone before.

1577
02:03:41,013 --> 02:03:43,880
And he has brought me here
to die in glory.

1578
02:03:44,417 --> 02:03:46,317
I was greatly punished.

1579
02:03:46,986 --> 02:03:50,649
My kingdom, my possessions, my child,
my husband were all taken from me.

1580
02:03:50,723 --> 02:03:53,191
I have been shut away for
many years in abject misery

1581
02:03:53,259 --> 02:03:56,353
and now I must die.
It is my destiny.

1582
02:03:56,996 --> 02:03:59,988
And it is your destiny, Elizabeth,
to kill me.

1583
02:04:01,167 --> 02:04:06,036
I leave to you the pomp,
the power, the intrigue

1584
02:04:06,772 --> 02:04:11,106
and all that a prince
in this world must endure or may enjoy.

1585
02:04:12,411 --> 02:04:16,404
Nothing you can say or do
will avoid my martyrdom.

1586
02:04:16,482 --> 02:04:18,848
So now it is I who pity you.

1587
02:04:19,585 --> 02:04:22,383
For you cannot avoid
ordering the thing

1588
02:04:22,455 --> 02:04:25,447
you have always feared
more than death itself,

1589
02:04:25,658 --> 02:04:28,821
the judicial murder
of an anointed Queen.

1590
02:04:30,095 --> 02:04:33,690
It will torment you
to the end of your days.

1591
02:04:35,835 --> 02:04:37,029
Robin!

1592
02:04:44,910 --> 02:04:46,241
My lord.

1593
02:04:46,312 --> 02:04:51,306
I shall pray for your mistress, Elizabeth,
at the moment of my death.

1594
02:05:09,602 --> 02:05:14,130
Madam, if your head had
matched your heart

1595
02:05:15,407 --> 02:05:17,739
I would be the one awaiting death.

1596
02:05:40,833 --> 02:05:42,027
O Lord,

1597
02:05:43,135 --> 02:05:47,333
I put my trust in you.
Do not let me be confounded.

1598
02:06:07,126 --> 02:06:08,787
It is time, madam.

1599
02:06:12,298 --> 02:06:16,394
Do not weep. I am happy.
Yes, I am. I'm happy.

1600
02:06:57,176 --> 02:06:58,643
Goodbye, dear.

1601
02:07:00,512 --> 02:07:03,640
You have been so faithful to me.
I do thank you.

1602
02:07:04,817 --> 02:07:06,284
Pray for me.

1603
02:07:28,807 --> 02:07:31,037
In you, O Lord,
have I put my trust.

1604
02:07:31,110 --> 02:07:33,442
For you, O Lord God,
are the thing that I long for.

1605
02:07:33,512 --> 02:07:35,912
You are my hope
even from my youth.

1606
02:07:35,981 --> 02:07:38,347
I am become, as it were,
a monster to many,

1607
02:07:38,417 --> 02:07:40,908
but my trust shall
always be in you.

1608
02:07:48,761 --> 02:07:51,195
Oh, let my mouth be
filled with your praise,

1609
02:07:51,263 --> 02:07:54,824
that I may sing of your glory
and honor all the day long.

1610
02:07:55,701 --> 02:07:58,602
Forsake me not
when my strength fails me.

1611
02:07:58,671 --> 02:08:00,639
Go not far from me, O God.

1612
02:08:00,706 --> 02:08:02,731
My God, hasten to help me.

1613
02:08:11,083 --> 02:08:14,610
I will go forth in the
strength of the Lord God.

1614
02:08:14,687 --> 02:08:17,121
My lips will be fain when I sing unto you

1615
02:08:17,189 --> 02:08:20,090
and so will my soul
whom you have delivered.

1616
02:08:35,674 --> 02:08:36,800
Forgive me, madam.

1617
02:08:36,875 --> 02:08:38,706
I forgive you
with all my heart.

1618
02:08:38,777 --> 02:08:44,181
I thank you even. I hope this death
shall put an end to all my troubles.

1619
02:08:48,187 --> 02:08:51,850
For in my end
is my beginning.

1620
02:09:11,810 --> 02:09:15,371
Lord, into your hands
I commend my spirit.
