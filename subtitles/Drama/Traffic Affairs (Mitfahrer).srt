{662}{760}Last night I had an ugly nightmare.
{781}{805}Oh, yeah?
{818}{852}What happened, man?
{867}{972}I'm lying down in my bed.|Then I get up...
{988}{1071}and there's my mother,|may she rest in peace...
{1085}{1174}seated in a chair|with a plastic bag over her head...
{1177}{1255}and she can't breathe.
{1265}{1334}And I can't help her.
{1348}{1396}Fuck.
{1840}{1874}What do we do?
{1876}{1930}We'll give them a half hour.
{2279}{2312}Who are they?
{2345}{2395}Don't worry.|It's just the police.
{2434}{2516}This is a private road.|You have to have a permit.
{2518}{2569}- Do you have a permit?|- I don't have a permit.
{2577}{2617}Do you have a permit?
{2647}{2705}Well, then, we have a problem.
{2707}{2749}Can we buy a permit?
{2761}{2846}Yeah, but it's gonna cost you.
{2857}{2921}- How much?|- Four hundred pesos.
{2942}{2994}You too-- 400 pesos.
{3228}{3309}What's underneath the tarp?
{3323}{3394}- Boxes of food.|- Show me.
{3896}{4017}Lay down on the ground, sweetie.|You're under arrest.
{4029}{4087}Yeah, you guys are screwed!
{5783}{5823}What's your name?
{5899}{5982}Javier Rodríguez Rodríguez.
{5984}{6058}Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez.
{6138}{6206}You've done an excellent job.
{6272}{6352}But we'll take over from here.
{6418}{6504}Put the prisoners in the Suburban|and impound the truck.
{6819}{6886}How did you find out about this?
{6933}{6987}A little bird told me.
{6990}{7046}What's the name|ofyour little bird?
{7107}{7163}It doesn't have a name.
{7218}{7285}Those fucking anonymous ones!
{7334}{7411}For an officer of the state police...
{7449}{7514}you're very well-informed.
{7735}{7826}- Hey, was that General Salazar?|- The Big Boss himself.
{7866}{7913}What is he doing around here?
{7916}{7972}Up to something. I don't know.
{8009}{8085}They took our handcuffs, Manolo.
{8129}{8243}This informant, paid by police,|using taxpayers' dollars...
{8245}{8307}to continue his felony|drug habit, was the link...
{8310}{8379}that allowed the police|to raid a private farm,
{8382}{8481}a working farm where honest|Americans make their living.
{8483}{8574}The government, in its haste,|has hired an army of criminals...
{8576}{8654}- whose allegiance to the truth|is at best questionable.|- Mr. Rodman...
{8700}{8779}it's a shame that your client|didn't use as much sense...
{8781}{8834}in choosing what he planted...
{8836}{8895}as he did|in choosing his attorney,
{8897}{8946}but, lately,|the only variation...
{8949}{9048}I'm hearing in your argument|is the name of your client.
{9051}{9138}You can stand here all day and argue|the ins and outs of Illinois v. Gates,
{9141}{9189}but you're not|gonna convince me...
{9191}{9299}that our government has not sanctioned|the use of anonymous informants.
{9302}{9410}Furthermore,|there is no sacred protection|of property rights in our country.
{9413}{9529}You grow marijuana on your farm,|be it an ounce or an acre,
{9532}{9586}that farm can be seized...
{9589}{9642}and that farm can be sold.
{9714}{9761}What the hell is that ?
{9764}{9863}You can tell a lot about somebody|from this stuff.
{9866}{9960}- It's from your friends|at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.|- A fishing rod.
{9963}{10054}- What do you think they want ?|- Depends what state they're from.
{10057}{10126}Uh... Arizona.
{10129}{10194}Arizona.
{10197}{10248}Medicinal marijuana initiative.
{10252}{10296}Or am I being cynical ?
{10300}{10382}Mark... I'm gonna miss you.
{10385}{10438}Thank you for all your hard work.
{10645}{10690}Hi. How are you today ?
{10693}{10758}You've got a daughter.|Why is it important to get|a handle on this drug problem ?
{10762}{10823}Because it's an issue|that affects all families.
{10826}{10898}- But I'm planning on being|back here as much as I can.|- How do you feel about--
{11587}{11647}Okay, Gordon, no telltales:|no scratching your nose,
{11650}{11698}no clearing your throat,|no crossing your legs.
{11701}{11746}- I got it.|- You got it, babe.
{11749}{11823}I'm cool, man.|You just don't tell any jokes.
{11826}{11899}- " Don't tell any jokes" ?|- Don't tell jokes.|It's a giveaway, Ray.
{11902}{11967}- It's not a giveaway.|- Every time you tell a joke,|it's a giveaway.
{11970}{12039}- Don't tell any jokes.|- You know what the problem is ?|You are too uptight, man.
{12042}{12098}Why don't you loosen up,|take a deep breath ?
{12102}{12151}Breathe in slowly.|A little stretching maybe.
{12154}{12199}- Come on, man. They're looking at us.|- Come on, man.
{12202}{12272}We're gonna get these motherfuckers.|We know our shit.
{12275}{12339}Can I get it ?|Can I get it ?
{12342}{12407}- Oh, baby, can I say it ?|- Say it. It's show time.
{12535}{12611}We're looking for Mr. Eduardo Ruiz.|We have a 2:00 appointment.
{12613}{12675}He's right down the hallway|in the back room.
{12678}{12723}Thank you.
{12872}{12949}Come in. Hey, fellas.
{12952}{12999}Come on, you guys. Get him talking.
{13002}{13079}- Get him outside.|- How you doing ?
{13082}{13149}- I'm well. How are you ?|- I'm good.
{13201}{13270}Look, what's up, Ed ?|We gonna move some white or what ?
{13274}{13339}You guys ever bought|a quarter ton before ?
{13340}{13392}- No ?|- I don't think so.
{13395}{13488}It's a big fucking deal, all right ?
{13491}{13536}It's not like you can stick it|in a condom up some mule's asshole.
{13539}{13603}How many peasants is that|gonna take ? You'd have a line|from here to Mexico City.
{13606}{13740}You say show up at a time, we show up at|the time and we're fucking sitting here.
{13743}{13819}- Sure I can't offer you|something to drink ?|- I can offer you ajoke.
{13822}{13903}You want to hear a joke ? I got|a joke, I got a joke. Come on, bro.
{13905}{13959}It's just a joke. Let me tell one joke.|I'm gonna tell you a joke.
{13961}{14063}All right, why are hurricane|named after women ?
{14066}{14143}- I don't know.|- Because when they arrive,|they're wet and wild.
{14146}{14213}When they leave, they take|your house and your car.
{14254}{14317}- It's true.|- You didn't find that funny ?
{14320}{14365}I chuckled. Damn.
{14368}{14439}- Fellas... that's us.|- Yo.
{14556}{14683}Okay, that's the van. Don't make|your move until they get Ruiz outside.
{14779}{14863}I told you there was|nothing to worry about.
{14911}{14963}I got another joke.
{14965}{15023}- Come on. Please.|-Just one more. Relax.
{15027}{15083}A guy goes, gets a tattoo|put on his penis.
{15086}{15148}One side says yes,|the other side says no.
{15151}{15203}- On his penis ?|- Yeah. The words "yes" and "no."
{15206}{15336}So, his wife says, "Hold it. You tell me|how to cook, how to clean the house--"
{15337}{15403}- Who the fuck is that ?|- That's local.
{15406}{15474}What the fuck is going--
{15477}{15529}Shit! Agent down !
{15532}{15569}Get in there now ! Go !
{15882}{15967}- D.E.A. !
{16173}{16226}The vest caught it.|Go ahead.
{16228}{16299}Go. Shit.
{17158}{17221}Shit !
{18738}{18823}- I think we lost him, Ray.|- Yeah, I think so too.
{18879}{18959}- Don't fucking move !|Get your hands-- Move !
{18963}{19011}Get out, you son of a bitch !|Get out !
{19014}{19119}Is this what|they wear to go to sleep...
{19122}{19191}or do they hang out like this|the whole time ?
{19194}{19293}That would be sleep attire.|- It's like a smoking jacket.
{19296}{19352}He's gonna be smoking|in a minute.
{19355}{19425}Okay, who's the father of|Greek tragedy ? Anyone ? Anyone ?
{19429}{19489}Okay, Aeschylus it is.|His trilogy ? The Oresteia.
{19492}{19605}This is fucking beautiful. Can anyone--|Can anyone stop the Seth machine ?
{19608}{19696}- No.|- That's correct. Score.
{19767}{19828}And "tragedy" is closed out.
{19891}{19948}- But wait.
{19951}{20023}- Is he her husband ?|- Yes.
{20026}{20123}Oh, hey, so, uh...|you want to try something ?
{20150}{20196}Yeah.
{20410}{20492}- What are you doing ?|-Just watch.
{20853}{20956}What you're going to do is|inhale the smoke and hold it.
{20959}{21008}What is this, like freebase ?
{21011}{21081}Not "like." It is.
{21163}{21224}Okay, go.|Go, go, go, go, go, go.
{21347}{21406}Hold it.|Hold it.
{21457}{21502}See ?
{21574}{21620}Now you see.
{22411}{22497}Oh, how-- Oh, they're doing great.
{22499}{22564}Look at how cute they are.
{22567}{22648}- Helena, he's doing so good.|- Little Tiger.
{22651}{22722}Little Tiger, I hope.
{22725}{22788}We'll be very happy if he|becomes the next Tiger Woods.
{22790}{22836}So will his bank balance.
{22838}{22908}- My God. Duck ?|- Duck. Thank you very much.
{22911}{22964}- Helena, you never order duck.|- I know, I know.
{22967}{23057}It's not me who ordered it.|It's somebody else.
{23058}{23120}Well, he or she|has very good taste.
{23123}{23177}- I love duck, don't you ?|- It's delicious.|Do you want some, Nan ?
{23180}{23277}- Oh, yes. Thank you.|- It's such a fatty bird.
{23280}{23341}There's good cholesterol,|and there's bad cholesterol,|which is confusing to me.
{23344}{23432}- Mmm, that's so good.|- You know what they say about red wine.
{23435}{23486}It's good for you.|There's cholesterol in my wine.
{23489}{23556}- You're allowed to have your red wine.|- The French do, don't they ?
{23559}{23604}I'm European.|I say that to my doctor.
{23607}{23680}"I'm European.|I'm allowed to drink red wine."
{23683}{23736}Oh, my doctor said it was fine|when I was pregnant.
{23740}{23812}- A glass a week.|- After my amnio,
{23815}{23868}he said, "Okay, now you can go|and have a glass ofred wine."
{23871}{23949}- I had two. 
{24035}{24100}- Did you have fun ?|- Yeah.
{24103}{24148}- Thanks a lot.|- Can I bring the bag|in the backwith me ?
{24151}{24217}- No, sweetheart.|- How about just my putter ?
{24220}{24272}- Give me the putter.|- All right.
{24275}{24348}In you get. Come on.|We've got to go.
{24352}{24417}Put this down here, okay ?
{24420}{24479}That's where Tiger Woods keeps it.|Thank you.
{24482}{24556}- You're welcome.|- Okay.
{24560}{24692}David, you're gonna have to promise me,|no swinging the club in the car.
{24695}{24732}Okay.
{24748}{24860}Until you officially take over the|Office of National Drug Control Policy,
{24863}{24933}under no circumstances will you speak|to the press unprotected...
{24937}{24983}without going through this office...
{24985}{25040}or having someone in the room.
{25043}{25096}There are a lot of interests|in this town.
{25100}{25144}Right now,|they're scared of you.
{25148}{25261}The reason they're scared|of you: Technically, you have|veto powers over their budgets.
{25263}{25320}You'll also be meeting|senators and congressmen,
{25323}{25376}each with a specially|prepared question.
{25380}{25464}They're questions designed for|one thing-- to make them look smart.
{25467}{25522}If you lecture them,|they won't think you respect them.
{25525}{25583}If you treat them|with utter humility, they will.
{25587}{25668}This is about your respect for them|and the president's respect for them.
{25671}{25740}Speaking of which, when he|gets back from Russia and China,
{25743}{25825}we'll get you two together for|some face time, let you two catch up.
{25828}{25923}Also, one month from today,|you will give your first|official press conference.
{25925}{26041}In it, you will outline the president's|strategy for winning the war on drugs.
{26043}{26113}Judge, I just want to be|clear about one thing:
{26116}{26168}I am not a partisan person,|I am an issue person.
{26172}{26232}Over the course of the next few weeks,|if you allow me,
{26235}{26297}I will bring you up to speed|on an incredible array of issues,
{26300}{26378}the most important ofwhich,|in my opinion, Mexico.
{26382}{26457}I know everyone you're going to meet.|I know what they want and why.
{26460}{26512}It is important|that they like you.
{26515}{26569}It is not important|that they like me.
{26571}{26632}That is why|I can help protect you.
{26635}{26700}Like you protected Landry ?
{26703}{26756}I see where you're going with that.
{26760}{26857}If I could say one thing: Basically,|a guy like Landry is so autocratic,
{26860}{26919}he doesn't even know how|to let himself be helped.
{26922}{27028}There's a political component|to this job that the general|didn't have any patience for.
{27033}{27102}General, Bob Wakefield.
{27037}{27104}General, Bob Wakefield.
{27108}{27183}-Judge, nice to meet you. Thank you.|- A pleasure to meet you, sir.
{27185}{27288}-Jeff, you want to excuse us ?
{27291}{27351}Yes, sir.|I'll be right outside.
{27353}{27413}- Have a seat.|- Thank you.
{27415}{27463}You've done a fine job, General.
{27465}{27524}The Office of National|Drug Control Policy...
{27528}{27588}is in better shape|than when you found it.
{27591}{27664}I'm not sure I made|the slightest difference.
{27667}{27749}I tried. I really did.
{27752}{27821}I think there are some positive signs.|The work's just started.
{27824}{27877}I plan on seeing it through.|You can count on that.
{27881}{27961}You're here for two years,|three maximum.
{27964}{28046}What'd they offer you,|a court appointment ?
{28049}{28129}District ? Appeals ?|Not Supreme.
{28131}{28232}This is a tough enough job.|I plan on focusing on this.
{28284}{28369}You know, when Khrushchev|was forced out,
{28372}{28449}he sat down, he wrote two letters|and gave them to his successor.
{28452}{28589}He said, "When you get yourself|into a situation you can't get out of,
{28592}{28676}"open the first letter,|and you'll be saved.
{28679}{28753}"And when you get yourself into|another situation you can't get out of,
{28756}{28805}open the second letter."
{28808}{28884}Well, soon enough, this guy|found himself in a tight place,
{28888}{29020}so he opened the first letter,|which said, " Blame everything on me."
{29023}{29089}So, he blamed the old man.|It worked like a charm.
{29092}{29153}He got himself into a second situation|he couldn't get out of,
{29156}{29201}and he opened the second letter.
{29204}{29313}It said, "Sit down|and write two letters."
{29408}{29473}Yeah.
{29753}{29805}Don't you want to know|what kind of car it is ?
{29808}{29920}- It's a brown Ford Explorer.|- It was here. It's been stolen.|I want to file a report.
{29923}{29997}A report will not help you|find your car.
{30000}{30081}- The police won't find your car.|- You are the police.
{30083}{30219}- You call this man...|and he'll find your car.|- I don't get it.
{30221}{30289}How is this guy gonna know|who has our car ?
{30292}{30340}The police will tell him.
{30344}{30405}Why will they tell him,|and they won't tell us ?
{30408}{30454}Because we pay him, stupid.
{30456}{30521}Right ? And he pays the police,|and suddenly our car appears.
{30524}{30597}Es correct.|Es correct.
{30599}{30685}Just give him the money.|Give him the money.
{30688}{30753}- Let's start moving to the sidewalk.|- Here, take it.
{30756}{30815}- No. No, no.|- No, please, take it.
{30818}{30904}Let's start moving to the sidewalk.|Let's go to the sidewalk.
{30908}{30980}Call the man.|Have a nice day.
{31419}{31493}-Javier Rodriguez.|- Si.
{31625}{31685}We want you to come with us.
{31718}{31792}- Where?|- It's just a short trip.
{31869}{31891}Follow me.
{31893}{31939}Bien.
{32208}{32259}I would say one thing|to you,Judge,
{32261}{32341}and that's you're never gonna solve|this problem on the supply side.
{32344}{32405}As long as that demand|is out there in our cities,
{32408}{32467}Mexico bashing is not gonna do|a damn thing for you.
{32469}{32573}We in the legal drug business--|Merck and Pfizer and the rest|of my very important clients--
{32576}{32666}realize that we're not fighting|a war here with a traditional|winner and loser.
{32669}{32714}I don't know that|you can win this war.
{32717}{32762}Everybody says we want|to declare war on drugs,
{32765}{32846}but if 25% of high school seniors|are using drugs--
{32848}{32917}-If you reduce that to 10,|that's a great improvement.|- Right.
{32921}{32977}I'll congratulate you.|That would be a phenomenal achievement,
{32980}{33052}but you'd still have 10%|habitually using drugs.
{33055}{33108}Can I get a scotch and soda, please ?
{33109}{33165}The price of coke|and heroin has dropped,
{33168}{33233}but purity has increased.
{33235}{33319}All this law enforcement|has really achieved is that|kids get better stuff cheaper.
{33321}{33381}Education, rehabilitation,|prevention--
{33385}{33429}that's not significant|to these reporters.
{33433}{33477}- Mm-hmm.|- They want to see people in prison.
{33481}{33552}They want to see the gory aspect|of the drug problem.
{33554}{33600}Thank you so much for sharing|your point of view.
{33602}{33657}- I look forward to working|with you in the future.|- Well, call me.
{33660}{33718}I have a good bill|on treatment-on-demand.|I could use your help.
{33720}{33779}- Wonderful. Look forward to it.|Thanks, Senator.|- Okay. Great.
{33782}{33851}If a judge or a politician is willing|to put a reefer in their mouth,
{33853}{33899}- I'll do a story on it.|- Right.
{33901}{33947}- Stand up and be independent.|- Right.
{33949}{34005}I don't care who's president. I don't|care who the members of congress are.
{34008}{34053}I don't care|who you have to deal with.
{34056}{34166}If you're independent and you|use that bully pulpit right,|that's where your power is.
{34169}{34214}It's the stick of law enforcement|that creates...
{34217}{34265}the carrot of huge profit|that is economic truth.
{34268}{34314}Addicts don't vote.
{34474}{34520}What the hell|are you doing here ?
{34572}{34630}You like your view ?
{34633}{34724}- TV screen big enough ?|- How's the food ?
{34793}{34853}Hope it's all good because this|is as good as it's gonna get...
{34856}{34921}for a long time, Eduardo.
{34924}{35004}I'm a legitimate businessman.|I've got tuna boats. I'm a fisherman.
{35006}{35052}- Check it out!|- Shut the fuck up !
{35054}{35111}- Fucking can it, bitch !|- You can't come in here like that!
{35113}{35150}- I want to see my lawyer.|- Okay.
{35152}{35213}It's cool, man.
{35217}{35290}- Eddie... you're in a lot of trouble.|- It's cool.
{35400}{35474}You know what ? The amount of coke|we found on this creep--
{35477}{35554}- that's capital punishment|in some states, right ?|- Yeah, down in Texas.
{35557}{35602}- They'll fry him.|- Definitely.
{35605}{35650}We've got him making|the deal on tape.
{35653}{35721}We got him bragging|about the quality, about his business.
{35724}{35782}- We got this motherfucker.|- You're fucked.
{35785}{35832}No, no, he's fucked.
{35925}{35973}I only see one way|out of this predicament.
{36156}{36211}You make us believe|you got a boss, Eddie.
{36261}{36310}Look, no boss, it's all on you.
{36312}{36359}No.
{36362}{36429}No, that's a death sentence.|I'd never make it to the trial.
{36433}{36526}- Look, we're gonna protect you.
{36528}{36596}- Who you working for ?|- This is coercion.
{36646}{36694}That's a big word|for a fisherman.
{36697}{36767}Big-ass word.|Who you working for ?
{36770}{36845}I know another big word.
{36849}{36897}Immunity.
{37041}{37088}Take it easy, will you ?
{37090}{37136}What's going on in here ?
{37138}{37186}- We have a warrant|to search your premises.|- What ?
{37189}{37237}Carl !
{37240}{37289}My husband !
{37292}{37337}- Relax. Ma'am.|- Carl !
{37340}{37396}Ma'am, right here.|You can't go any further.
{37398}{37464}- David, come here !|- Ma'am, I have a search warrant.
{37466}{37506}He'll be back.
{37510}{37614}Where are they taking Daddy ?
{37617}{37663}He'll be all right.
{37705}{37758}He's all right. They're just gonna|take him to the office and talk.
{37760}{37805}Just relax.|They're not going to hurt him.
{37808}{37862}- I don't understand what's going on.|- He'll be all right.
{37865}{37925}- What are they doing to Daddy ?|- Daddy's gonna be okay.
{37929}{38017}It's okay, sweetheart.|It's okay, baby.
{38397}{38435}Not you.
{38438}{38461}You.
{38572}{38617}I'll wait here.
{38639}{38721}Five years with the Tijuana police.
{38766}{38833}Three years in the state police.
{38886}{39019}Your parents died when their house|flooded in the rains of '93.
{39074}{39125}How unfortunate.
{39237}{39356}You make $316 a month.
{39411}{39461}That's what they pay.
{39479}{39518}Well, look.
{39598}{39688}This could be your past.
{39755}{39847}We can talk about your future...
{39892}{39963}if you can do me a favor.
{39974}{40020}If I can.
{40108}{40229}I want to wipe out|the Tijuana cartel.
{40326}{40387}What can I do to help?
{40478}{40548}His name is Francisco Flores.
{40563}{40618}He's an assassin.
{40621}{40709}He runs guns for the Tijuana cartel.
{40742}{40807}I have to talk to him.
{40810}{40916}I need you to find him|and bring him here.
{40951}{41030}- This is crazy!|- Don't freak out, Manolo.
{41033}{41087}Don't you know|who "Frankie Flowers" is?
{41144}{41246}A hired assassin! A psychopath!|Fucking crazy!
{41248}{41341}- Who knows how many he's killed!|- Then I'll go by myself.
{41358}{41412}And we can't ask for help...
{41414}{41472}because he lives in San Diego.
{41661}{41706}Ah.
{41709}{41814}Well... is this|a surprise or what ?
{41817}{41866}An honor.|Thank you.
{41869}{41922}- Hi, sweetie. |- Good trip ?
{41925}{42018}- How are you ?|- Good trip. I'm good.|I just can't believe this.
{42020}{42106}- What's Washington like ?|- It's like, uh--
{42109}{42182}It's like Calcutta;|surrounded by beggars.
{42185}{42254}Only these beggars|are wearing $1,500 suits...
{42257}{42330}and they don't say|"please" and "thank you."
{42388}{42447}So, we put|the case before the arbitration panel,
{42451}{42508}none of whom have|any expertise.
{42510}{42556}"Superfund" is just|one of those words.
{42558}{42604}People stop paying attention.
{42606}{42711}- It's frustrating.|- It's so frustrating.
{42714}{42759}Did you meet the president ?
{42762}{42822}Honey, your father|knows the president.
{42826}{42894}It just so happens... that|the president of the United States,
{42898}{42943}my new boss,|the leader of the free world,
{42946}{43020}has penciled me in|for a little face time.
{43022}{43103}None of my friends can fucking believe|my dad's actually the drug czar.
{43104}{43222}- Caroline.|- I'm sorry, but, I mean, come on.
{43225}{43295}It's great.|It's great, Daddy.
{43298}{43383}It's just amazing, that's all.
{43523}{43567}Arnie, thank God.
{43571}{43627}Helena, I am so--
{43628}{43678}Please tell me|what's going on here.
{43681}{43750}What is going on ? They came into|the house. They just took him away.
{43753}{43815}They searched my home.
{43817}{43876}Let me tell you what's happening.|All right ?
{43909}{43990}First of all, Carl is not here.
{43993}{44050}The D.E.A. has got him.
{44053}{44102}They're gonna hang onto him|until his arraignment,
{44105}{44163}which will probably be tomorrow.
{44166}{44259}So here you are wasting your time.|All right ? Are you with me ?
{44261}{44344}- Yeah.|- Okay. Now, do not discuss anything...
{44347}{44406}over the telephone.
{44409}{44486}Don't talk to your neighbors.|Stay out of your yard.
{44490}{44554}- What is he charged with, Arnie ?|- I don't know,
{44558}{44672}but under no circumstances|am I going to talk about it here.
{44675}{44775}Now, you go home and be with your son.|All right ?
{46086}{46131}Miss ?
{46134}{46183}Can I have a Budweiser ?
{46387}{46460}- Excuse me.|- Yes ?
{46463}{46536}Can you give me a cigarette ?
{47891}{47970}It would be interesting to know|how you did it so quickly.
{48011}{48087}We all have our weak side.
{48135}{48220}The path of the Lord|is very subtle.
{48230}{48251}Amen.
{48466}{48510}What a badass.
{48606}{48722}All I'm saying--|What I'm-- What I'm saying is...
{48726}{48827}it never seems like anyone ever says|anything that matters to them.
{48830}{48934}We all look at each other|and nod with these--
{48938}{49079}these responses|that we've been trained to make.
{49081}{49131}Responses--|Not real responses.
{49134}{49255}Social conventions,|like phony, fake smiles;
{49258}{49307}surface bullshit.
{49309}{49359}Do I ever just say:
{49362}{49450}" Hey... I'm uncomfortable|in this crowd."
{49454}{49511}"I don't know what the fuck|I'm doing either."
{49514}{49615}"l know you're afraid,|and that's okay, you know, because--"
{49618}{49707}Hello ? Fucking... exactly.
{49710}{49755}We act like we have all the answers|and we're totally invincible...
{49758}{49803}like our parents seem|and their parents before them.
{49806}{49883}I'm sorry I have to be the one|to say this, but it's fucking bullshit.
{49886}{49951}- For instance ?|- I know you jack off|to Caroline every night,
{49954}{50003}instead of Vanessa,|who you're supposed to be in love with.
{50006}{50095}Don't even get me started|on that convention.
{50098}{50143}Because what is that convention ?
{50146}{50200}We're this random collection|of self interests,|and all of a sudden we decide...
{50203}{50312}that we're gonna walk two-by-two|down the fucking aisle to Noah's Ark ?
{50315}{50403}Actually, for your information,|when I jerk off,
{50407}{50487}I'm not just thinking about Caroline,|I'm thinking about you with Caroline.
{50490}{50555}- So, how about that ?|- Baby--
{50599}{50715}That is what|I'm talking about-- sarcasm.
{50718}{50795}Always fucking sarcasm.
{50798}{50883}You're afraid, and you think|that if you admit that,
{50886}{50943}people will think|that you are weak...
{50947}{51020}or they won't like you...
{51023}{51107}or whatever it is|you think will happen, but--
{51110}{51211}Can you shut up for one second|and listen to yourself?
{51214}{51259}Wh-What ?
{51262}{51388}Because you are so fucking right.
{51392}{51444}- I'm so fucking high.|- Yeah ?
{51446}{51500}- Yeah.|- Okay, wait.
{51503}{51551}Why don't we...
{51554}{51643}change this thing,|this social pattern ?
{51646}{51684}Why don't we be different ?
{51687}{51772}- Yeah.|- But then why are you|even talking about it ?
{51774}{51827}But we're making it,|like, from now on.
{51830}{51916}You're like,|"Why don't we do something ?"
{51919}{51977}- Why don't you do something ?|- That's what I'm saying, Seth.
{51979}{52061}- You do it yourself--|- I'm saying if you knew it,|you wouldn't even say it.
{52063}{52109}Vanessa, I'm serious, I feel fucked up.
{52111}{52212}It's a social pattern, you know?
{52299}{52399}Spence, baby, are you all right ?
{52403}{52449}He's fucking blue.|He isn't breathing.
{52452}{52525}Oh, my God, Fucked-up Bowman's|fucked up.
{52527}{52607}- Wait--|- What the fuck do we do ?
{52609}{52689}- Uh-- Oh, God--|- Fuck !
{52691}{52784}- Somebody call a doctor !|- Wait, your dad's a doctor. Call him.
{52787}{52844}No, he's a research--|Call your dad. He's a doctor.
{52846}{52913}- What kind of research ?|- Mapping the fucking pig genome.
{52915}{52969}Call your dad!|He's a neurosurgeon!
{52971}{53021}I can't call my dad !|It's 3:00 in the morning !
{53023}{53119}He's gonna fucking die right here|on the floor if you don't do something !
{53122}{53218}No, he can't die on the floor!|His parents are in Barbados !
{53464}{53511}Move ! Move !
{53948}{54048}Okay, nobody has anything|on them, right ?
{54051}{54096}Fuck !
{54300}{54390}We know that you killed|our chief of intelligence.
{54427}{54478}We also know that you...
{54490}{54627}killed police chiefs|in Tijuana and Mexico City.
{54682}{54724}A question.
{54753}{54800}Why do you resist?
{54912}{54978}My father has money.
{54990}{55061}That is not the correct answer.
{55108}{55159}We also found out...
{55162}{55253}that you hunted down|a neighbor of General Salazar.
{55255}{55317}A poor peasant.
{55319}{55372}Your people killed|his granddaughter.
{55426}{55468}That was a stupid thing to do.
{55496}{55553}- You fucked up.
{56847}{56924}I'm on the board|of my son's school.
{56927}{57064}I have fund-raisers|for adult literacy at my own home.
{57107}{57221}I think I have a right to know if|my husband is a legitimate businessman.
{57223}{57284}Of course he is.
{57287}{57386}I've known Carl for 20 years.|He doesn't even jaywalk.
{57491}{57620}Carl is a very important member of this|community, and when we get through...
{57621}{57680}suing the police and|the district attorney and the D.E.A.,
{57683}{57788}they're gonna be renaming|the public parks after your husband.
{57874}{57964}Carl is very, very good|at his business.
{58043}{58152}Which is smuggling illegal drugs|into this country.
{58470}{58524}- They're whispering.|They're whispering.|- I know.
{58527}{58612}- Can't hear it.|- I know. The fucking bug's|too far away from the room.
{58615}{58672}It's halfway to the kitchen.|We're not gonna get shit.
{58674}{58720}They're saying something.
{58722}{58782}Sounds like they're conspiring|to conspire.
{58784}{58844}I can feel the lies vibrating|from their home.
{58903}{58948}I don't think|she's in on it, man.
{58951}{59036}Come on, I dream about this.|I have actual dreams about this.
{59039}{59112}About busting the top people,|the rich people.
{59115}{59180}- White people. Hey.|- White people. I know, I know.
{59182}{59248}I don't think she's in on it, man.
{59251}{59320}She knows Arnie Metzger.
{59323}{59384}So does half of San Diego.
{59387}{59452}- You want to bet ?|- Get in your pocket.
{59455}{59504}- I got--|- I love it. I love it when you do this.
{59507}{59600}- How much you want to bet ? How much ?|- I got-- I got 12 bucks.
{59603}{59688}- Okay, give me ten. We'll make it even.|- Okay.
{59691}{59763}- Beautiful.|- Wait a minute. What ?
{59859}{59938}- How old are you ?|- Sixteen.
{59976}{60027}Live with your parents ?
{60030}{60087}Yes.
{60089}{60135}Parents still together ?
{60137}{60183}Yes.
{60227}{60316}- Do you work ?|- I volunteer.
{60320}{60417}I read to blind people,|one day a week for two hours.
{60451}{60496}In school ?
{60499}{60564}Yes.
{60567}{60612}Private ?
{60615}{60660}Yeah.
{60702}{60760}How are your grades ?
{60763}{60876}- I'm third in my class.|- What does that mean ?
{60878}{60997}- I get A's, all A's.|- You do ?
{61000}{61056}What else do you do ?
{61059}{61113}I'm a National Merit Finalist.
{61116}{61188}I'm on the Hi-Q Team|and the Math Team.
{61190}{61252}I'm in the Spanish Club.|I'm a thespian.
{61256}{61329}I'm vice president of my class.
{61331}{61376}I'm on the volleyball team.
{61484}{61550}You want to tell me|what you're doing here, Caroline ?
{62009}{62054}Carol.
{62091}{62152}Oh, sweetie.
{62222}{62269}You okay ?
{62309}{62355}It's okay.
{62396}{62458}Caroline, how well did you know|this boy that overdosed?
{62460}{62541}He didn't hang around us.
{62544}{62608}He was like one|of those hippie kids.
{62612}{62665}I'm not part of that group.
{62704}{62832}How well did you know this boy Seth,|the one that was driving ?
{62874}{62945}He's a friend.
{62948}{63047}He's also the only one that was doing|anything about the situation.
{63049}{63155}He definitely had|a few beers, but...
{63157}{63208}it's not like|he wanted to drive.
{63211}{63272}We just didn't know|what else to do.
{63275}{63360}It wasn't my pot.
{63419}{63515}Okay, we understand, honey.|We've got to talk.
{63518}{63567}Alone.
{63764}{63828}- I think she's lying.|- Me too.
{63832}{63892}So let's ground her,|clip her wings:
{63895}{63973}school, scheduled activities|till further notice.
{63976}{64101}Robert, honey, Caroline|clearly used very bad judgment,
{64104}{64229}but don't you think spending a night|in jail is punishment enough ?
{64232}{64309}I mean, we've all|had our moments.
{64311}{64409}- Lord knows, I tried|every drug there was--|- I don't want to hear about that.
{64413}{64480}You experimented|when you were in college.
{64484}{64528}Shall we take the quotes off|experiment and call it what it was ?
{64532}{64576}- This is different.|- Why ?
{64580}{64705}- She's 16 years old !|- I think she needs to find out|for herself, on her own.
{64708}{64793}- We have to allow her room|to figure out--|- You want to give her room ?
{64796}{64847}So she can O.D.|like that other kid ?
{64849}{64948}I am not sending out the message that|our family will accept this behavior...
{64952}{64996}because we do not.
{65000}{65079}- Correct ?|- Of course, but we don't want|to push her away.
{65081}{65204}She has to know that we understand|what she's exposed to.
{65207}{65268}How long have you known|about this ?
{65328}{65385}How long have you known ?
{65456}{65503}Six months.
{65675}{65769}My technique is more profound|than yours, Javier.
{65800}{65854}Much more profound.
{65867}{65934}When he loves me like a father,
{65937}{66009}he will never tell anyone|he was here.
{66049}{66131}He will give me|the names of his superiors.
{66141}{66248}Then we get them|and they too will give us names.
{66312}{66454}And eventually somebody|will get us to Juan Obregón.
{66502}{66625}And on that day,|the Tijuana cartel will fall.
{66997}{67044}What a disgrace.
{67092}{67152}What a disgrace, Francisco Flores.
{67188}{67268}It's all right. Salazar is here.
{67309}{67387}You're among friends now.
{67398}{67473}This shameful treatment|will stop immediately.
{67492}{67529}Guard!
{67546}{67565}Yes, General.
{67651}{67718}Are you responsible for this?
{67721}{67794}- We are not savages!|- Yes, General.
{67797}{67855}- Has he eaten?|- I don't know, sir.
{67869}{67950}- Go get him some clothes.|- Yes, General.
{68029}{68117}Your Honor, this is a man who heads|a large criminal organization...
{68120}{68225}with international contacts|we can only begin to understand.
{68228}{68289}Our case against him is very strong.
{68292}{68401}He is not a flight risk.|His flight is assured.
{68404}{68497}The people ask that Your Honor|deny bail. Thank you.
{68528}{68577}My client is no more|a flight risk...
{68580}{68631}than Your Honor|or the able prosecutor.
{68633}{68681}He's a pillar|of his community;
{68684}{68777}a family man with a wife and child|living in La Jolla,
{68779}{68839}the communitywhere he has made|his home for the past 20 years.
{68842}{68888}As our defense|will quickly show,
{68889}{68936}my client is guilty|of nothing more...
{68937}{69007}than being the handy target|of an admitted criminal.
{69009}{69090}Therefore, we ask that you release|Carl Ayala on his own recognizance.
{69128}{69173}I'm going to deny bail.
{69929}{69997}I appreciate you coming in|so early this morning.
{70000}{70053}Judge Wakefield,|it's an honor to handle it.
{70057}{70130}She's a minor. It probably would have|expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
{70133}{70250}Nevertheless, this is asensitive issue|for me. I'm sure you can understand.
{70252}{70337}Like I said, open container,|P.I., misdemeanor possession.
{70341}{70385}It's easy to make it go away.
{70389}{70513}One thing bothers me: The kid they|dropped off had coke and heroin in him.
{70516}{70588}Serious amounts.|He's lucky he's alive.
{70591}{70653}So I've got to ask:|What's your daughter on ?
{70656}{70710}I don't know what you mean.
{70713}{70839}I mean... have you asked her|what kind of drugs she's tried ?
{70925}{70970}No.
{70973}{71042}I don't know.
{71045}{71138}- Is she in any kind of therapy,|professional help ?|- No, no, no. No way.
{71141}{71213}My daughter is one of|the leading students in her school.
{71326}{71395}Well, I hope it stays that way.
{71600}{71646}Yeah, hi, it's Robert.
{71649}{71740}I want you to clean out my schedule|for the next three days.
{71742}{71841}Because I'm tired of talking to experts|who've never left the beltway.
{71844}{71910}It's time|to see the front lines.
{72748}{72822}Carlos Ayala started out|in the family connection business--
{72825}{72942}real estate in Tijuana,|fishing boats out of Ensenada,|hydroponic strawberries.
{72945}{73005}Then he met up with the Obregon brothers|ofthe Tijuana cartel.
{73007}{73066}Using regression analysis,|we made a study...
{73068}{73162}of the custom lines at the border|and calculated the odds of a search.
{73164}{73237}The odds are not high, and we found|variables to reduce those odds.
{73240}{73302}So, you pay off|customs officials ?
{73304}{73390}Well, you know, in Mexico...
{73393}{73469}law enforcement is|an entrepreneurial activity.
{73473}{73536}Not so much in the States.|Anyway, we, uh--
{73538}{73612}We hire drivers with nothing to lose and|throw a lot of product at the problem.
{73615}{73682}Some get stopped. Enough get through.|It's not difficult.
{73684}{73806}Look, boys, this has worked for years.|It's gonna continue to work for years.
{73809}{73891}NAFTA makes things even|more difficult for you because|the border's disappearing.
{73893}{73978}Do you realize in the next|year or two at the outside|Mexican trucking companies...
{73981}{74054}are gonna be able to go from the States|to Mexico and back again...
{74056}{74149}with the same freedom|as U.P.S., D.H.L., FedEx ?
{74152}{74275}- It's gonna be a free-for-all.|- What, are we on Larry King|or something ?
{74278}{74334}Shit.
{74336}{74394}Tell us something|we don't know, Eddie.
{74397}{74474}You guys remind me of those Japanese|soldiers left on deserted islands...
{74477}{74542}who think World War II|is still going on.
{74545}{74651}Let me be the first to tell you,|your government surrendered|this war a long time ago.
{74654}{74727}I don't think all this attitude|is gonna help in front of a jury.
{74730}{74809}- It's really a bad attitude.|- Very bad. Very bad.
{74853}{74937}Look, Ed, there's only one problem|with all this math. You're in here.
{75017}{75062}Well, I got greedy, didn't I ?
{75064}{75118}- Yes, you did.|- Yeah.
{75121}{75202}Decided to bring a little in on my own|and somebody tipped you off.
{75204}{75262}Carl never would have|been so stupid.
{75265}{75355}Well, Carl hired you.|That was a mistake.
{75426}{75496}Carl and I have been friends|since we were little kids.
{75533}{75578}He was loyal.
{75694}{75738}Javi.
{75741}{75801}A group of us are going to a party.
{75804}{75845}Who?
{75847}{75976}Esteban, Guzmán, Tomás,|all of them.
{75984}{76034}Your new buddies.
{76071}{76113}Yes.
{76115}{76154}- Let's go.|- No.
{76157}{76225}- It'll be fun.|- Another day.
{76323}{76410}At my house I have|some B&W speakers.
{76432}{76520}A while ago I bought a CD burner.
{76522}{76615}I make CDs with the music I want.
{76636}{76717}Just like I bought them in a store.
{76737}{76829}You and I have a lot in common.|Not everything, but a lot.
{76831}{76932}We both studied on the other side|with the gringos.
{76965}{77025}Your father is an engineer, right?
{77027}{77112}My father-- may he rest in peace--|was also an engineer.
{77158}{77245}I've been into stereos|since I was very young.
{77272}{77330}Most people don't care...
{77348}{77462}but for me it's very important.
{77730}{77793}They say in Latin:
{77796}{77873}In vino veritas.|Wine brings out the truth.
{77951}{78018}Use this to write down...
{78041}{78147}the addresses of those bastards|who killed my captains.
{78194}{78293}And not where they were last week,|but where they are now.
{78296}{78369}Where they are this minute.
{78376}{78472}And better yet,|where they are going to be tomorrow.
{78566}{78665}You know where they are going|to be tomorrow, right?
{79677}{79773}Reported by the government|news agency, Notimex (NTX) :
{79812}{79954}"Yesterday, forces of the Mexican Army,|acting on an anonymmous tip...
{79982}{80133}joined with police to arrest members|of the Obregón brothers drug cartel.
{80159}{80310}Head of the Federal Drug Forces, Gen.|Arturo Salazar, said in Mexico City...
{80312}{80449}that the sweep was a crippling blow|to the Obregón brothers...
{80452}{80585}who reportedly dominate|the narcotics trade...
{80588}{80738}in the city of Tijuana|and the rest of Baja California state.
{80769}{80926}General Salazar wen t on to say that|the au thorities were working overtime...
{80951}{81120}to confirm that Porfirio Madrigal,|head of the rival Juárez cartel...
{81140}{81257}died last week during|a plastic surgery procedure."
{81312}{81355}Here it is, here it is.
{81420}{81469}Get out, asshole.
{81487}{81536}- Are you going to kill me?|- No.
{81556}{81626}No, the Obregóns|will do that for us.
{82152}{82198}The port of San Ysidro, California:
{82200}{82294}45,000 vehicles on average,|25,000 pedestrians per day.
{82427}{82519}- In the last six months,|a threefold increase ?|- Increase in narcotics seizures.
{82521}{82610}Would that mean, pro rata, three times|as much drugs is getting in ?
{82613}{82689}That's a scary way to figure it,|but I believe that's true.
{82691}{82770}In my heart, I'd love to say|that we were getting 60 or 70%.
{82774}{82888}In the reality, we're more like 40 or|50% of the total that's approaching us.
{82891}{82945}And it's all big-dollar issues now.
{82947}{82993}That's the reason you're seeing|a lot of these murders taking place.
{82995}{83050}It's one organization|fighting another organization.
{83053}{83098}When things are good,|people don't kill each other.
{83102}{83151}When things are bad,|when they're losing dope,
{83154}{83199}when they're losing drivers|and guys are going to jail,
{83202}{83250}people start killing each other.
{83459}{83551}- How's David ?|- "How's David ?"
{83554}{83640}- Oh, he's terrific, Carl. Terrific.|- Oh, Helena--
{83643}{83698}He watched his father|being dragged away by federal agents.
{83700}{83772}- He's just doing fine.|- Okay.
{83775}{83838}I can't even begin|to tell him where you are...
{83840}{83902}and when you're coming home,|if you're ever coming home.
{83904}{84002}Helena... we're gonna get through this.
{84005}{84051}I promise.
{84053}{84159}- I'll make it up to you.|- Do you have any idea|what's going on out here ?
{84162}{84236}Huh ? Our credit cards are maxed.
{84239}{84364}The people in the bank--|you should see the way they|look at me when I walk in.
{84367}{84418}I have a letter|from the government telling me...
{84420}{84515}anything I sell from the house will be|taken against an income tax lien.
{84517}{84592}Our fucking friends--
{84595}{84678}Nobody will help us.|Nobody will take us in.
{84681}{84753}Nobody wants anything|to do with us, Carl.
{84755}{84832}So, you just tell me|how you're gonna make it up to me.
{84864}{84927}Helena--
{84930}{85002}Just tell me what to do.
{85004}{85078}I'm not bringing a child into the life|that I was brought up into.
{85081}{85136}I won't do it, Carl.
{85139}{85211}I want our life back.
{86527}{86572}Yeah, we're smarter.|We know the difference.
{86575}{86664}Hello. Ding, ding, ding.|We have a winner.
{86667}{86733}- Hi, folks.|- Hello.|- Hi. Room 310, please.
{86735}{86849}- Okay, I need to see some|I.D.s, please, and $28.|- Okay.
{86892}{86943}Man, I love this place.
{87508}{87599}I wish we could|just stay here.
{87601}{87695}Just be here forever|and ever and...
{87697}{87760}make a little home here.
{88039}{88117}I want to, uh...
{88119}{88226}I want to have sex and then do a hit|right as we're both coming.
{88388}{88434}Okay.
{89278}{89342}The first time I got laid|was on a beach just like that.
{89376}{89459}- You got a what on a beach ?|- Got laid, man.
{89461}{89527}Lost my virginity,|was a sophomore in high school.
{89528}{89585}- That's cool.|- Yeah, it was sweet.
{89615}{89660}Did he treat you good ?
{90035}{90091}- Who's this guy ?|- I don't know.
{90093}{90147}- I never seen him before.|- He's going right for the kid.
{90255}{90301}David !
{90349}{90408}David, come back here !
{90460}{90506}- Mom, Mom.|- Please, put down my son.
{90508}{90565}Shouldn't let|your kid wander off with strangers.
{90567}{90660}Karen, if he tries to move|with that kid, you break cover.
{90663}{90771}Mrs. Ayala, your husband owes|a lot of money. Snapping this|kid's neck wouldn't cover it.
{90773}{90843}You better come up with it in a hurry|or your kid is gonna disappear,
{90845}{90909}and he won't turn up|until the evening news.
{90912}{90996}You get only one warning.|First payment is $3 million.
{91588}{91685}-Javier.|- Yes?
{91738}{91779}What's up, Ana?
{91823}{91894}Manolo never came home last night.
{91909}{91966}Come in, come in. Sit down.
{92096}{92152}I don't know where he is.
{92172}{92216}He wasn't with you last night?
{92218}{92264}No.
{92347}{92387}I'm worried.
{92389}{92454}Don't worry too much.|It makes you ugly.
{92461}{92537}Do you want a coffee?|Coffee with sugar?
{92542}{92588}- No.|- No?
{92621}{92677}Look, Javier.
{92709}{92765}I was going through his clothes|the other day.
{92813}{92866}Look what I found.
{92947}{92989}What is it?
{93154}{93257}- What were you doing?|- I was with friends from work.
{93290}{93356}Was Salazar there?
{93386}{93444}No.
{93446}{93509}The general is going|to Mexico City next week...
{93512}{93565}and I'm not going|to get left behind.
{94167}{94208}Javier Rodriguez.
{94211}{94287}The word is you're not|that happy in your work.
{94291}{94357}Maybe we can help.
{94798}{94871}-John, how are you ?|Bob Wakefield, pleasure.|-Judge, welcome.
{94874}{94926}- Good to see you. How are you ?|- Long time, no see.
{94928}{94991}EPIC is very unique.
{94995}{95086}It's a facility that has over 15|different agencies--state and local--
{95088}{95146}that participate|in gathering intelligence...
{95148}{95204}and making sure|that information gets out...
{95206}{95302}to people in the field that need it|to stop drug trafficking.
{95304}{95420}From here, we have the ability|to track vessels, airplanes, boats,
{95422}{95472}anything that carries drugs.
{95475}{95556}When the information comes in,|we're able to check|with different databases...
{95559}{95604}to see if it's|in the system or not.
{95607}{95671}And would most of that energy|be focused on the two cartels ?
{95674}{95780}The Juarez, the Obregon brothers--|Are those the two that would be|most important ?
{95782}{95844}Those are the two|clearest threats right now.
{95847}{95911}They are the dominant force|in trafficking,
{95913}{95962}both on the Mexican side|and in the U.S.
{95964}{96039}How are the cartels achieving...
{96041}{96117}the level of intelligence and|sophistication that they're showing ?
{96121}{96192}- Craig, why don't you answer that ?|- An unlimited budget.
{96194}{96255}So, you're saying, actually,|that even a country of our size...
{96258}{96347}and the budget that we throw|towards this issue,
{96351}{96427}- they can compete at the same level?|- No, they're way beyond us.
{96429}{96509}- "Way beyond"?|- Our budgetary process|makes us pale in comparison.
{96582}{96686}That house you're looking at over there|used to belong to Porfirio Madrigal.
{96688}{96744}His nickname was Scorpion.
{96748}{96796}I'll let you figure out|what that means.
{96799}{96859}Wasn't that the guy|who died during plastic surgery ?
{96861}{96917}Best of our information, yes.
{96919}{96977}Who do you interact with|on that side ?
{96980}{97036}Nobody.
{97038}{97100}Well, who has my job in Mexico ?
{97103}{97179}Your position doesn't exist|over there yet.
{97366}{97431}I want|everyone thinking out of the box...
{97433}{97481}for the next few minutes.
{97483}{97546}What are we doing about Mexico ?
{97548}{97627}- Come on, guys, out of the box.|- Unlimited funds ?
{97628}{97679}Unlimited.
{97682}{97774}From a D.E.A. standpoint, we need|a vetted task force and matching funds.
{97776}{97864}And cut the red tape on getting them|equipment and training.
{97867}{97913}Come on, guys,|I want to hear from everyone:
{97916}{97982}F.B.I., customs, treatment.
{98021}{98072}- Is there anybody from treatment|on this plane ?|- No, Judge.
{98074}{98147}Then, I want to know why there isn't|anybody from treatment on this plane.
{98150}{98197}Yes, sir.
{98201}{98295}We need to take down one of|these cartels--Juarez or Tijuana--
{98299}{98348}not because they're a symbol, but--
{98351}{98469}Hell, they are a symbol.|But because we need to send a message.
{98472}{98560}When Carlos Ayala hires Michael Adler|as his legal defense,
{98563}{98636}I send Ben Williams|down to San Diego as a prosecutor.
{98638}{98708}Why ? Because it's a symbol.
{98710}{98787}It's a symbol that|we are sending the best.
{98789}{98898}It's a message that we're|going after their top guys.
{98900}{98961}So...
{98963}{99012}right now...
{99014}{99100}on this flight only...
{99103}{99161}the dam is open...
{99163}{99240}for new ideas.
{99482}{99548}On a clear day,|you can see Mexico City.
{99551}{99636}I have this place swept twice a day,|so just feel free to talk.
{99639}{99733}I learned that back|in Miami in '85.
{99735}{99784}U.S. shut down|the entire Caribbean.
{99787}{99890}- It's a big game of whack-a-mole.|You knock it down in Miami--|- Arnie, I need money.
{99893}{99972}Somebody-- I think it was the Obregons--|threatened David.
{99974}{100053}They want a first payment|of $3 million.
{100055}{100132}Oh, Helena.
{100135}{100216}I'd give it to you myself, but I-I-I|just don't have that kind of money.
{100218}{100264}Please. Does anyone owe us money ?
{100266}{100375}Yes, there are people that do owe|you money, but nobody's gonna pay.
{100378}{100446}Carl's got too much heat on him.
{100448}{100548}What about our other businesses,|our legitimate businesses ?
{100551}{100645}- Don't we own a construction--|- Laundromats wash the money.
{100647}{100700}Just tell me something|positive, Arnie.
{100702}{100768}Give me some good news,|for Christ's sake.
{100770}{100817}I'm sorry.
{100936}{101008}I just keep wondering what's|gonna happen if he doesn't get out.
{101010}{101094}Just never been|on my own before.
{101097}{101184}Always had someone. Always.
{101364}{101484}I remember the first time|that I saw you--
{101487}{101605}little Helen Watts|from the wrong side of somewhere.
{101608}{101747}Somehow I knew even then that your|survival skills were pretty well honed.
{101749}{101836}Glad you think so, Arnie.
{101838}{101950}I just keep picturing a debt-ridden,|30-year-old mother of two...
{101953}{102052}whose ex-husband|is being compared to Pablo Escobar.
{102098}{102196}I don't know anyone who wants|to be with someone like that.
{102257}{102275}Do you ?
{102283}{102302}Do you ?
{103111}{103174}You two don't like me, do you?
{103185}{103287}Miss, with all due respect,|we don't have an opinion.
{103289}{103340}Maybe it's because|I'm going to have...
{103343}{103392}the nicest home you've ever seen|in your miserable lives.
{103445}{103506}The old man actually|kept his promise.
{103509}{103612}The general is a man of his word.
{103650}{103729}They will say anything|to get what they want...
{103732}{103856}and then it's always|tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow.
{103858}{103935}Occupational hazard, I guess.
{104506}{104563}- The bags?
{104587}{104744}-My love, it's beautiful! How beautiful!
{104747}{104805}How are you feeling? Good?
{104838}{104894}How handsome you are.
{105125}{105164}Listen...
{105167}{105224}the Scorpion is alive.
{105278}{105319}Get in.
{105414}{105497}Porfirio Madrigal|isn't dead after all!
{105515}{105604}That means that Salazar is working|for the Juárez cartel.
{105637}{105709}I can't believe|this doesn't matter to you.
{105739}{105789}This is nothing new, Manolo.
{105791}{105875}That's why Salazar is so interested|in cleaning up Tijuana.
{105877}{105941}And he has plans for Juan Obregón,|the bastard.
{105971}{106019}That's right.
{106060}{106145}You know how much money|he would pay for this information?
{106147}{106219}- How much?|- A fuckload of money, partner.
{106332}{106440}- What's up, man?|- Take off your glasses.
{106443}{106520}Take off your glasses|so I can see your eyes.
{106738}{106832}We're going to keep|our mouths shut.
{106902}{106952}Okay.
{107132}{107205}I think we|may have found our Mexican drug czar.
{107207}{107277}General Salazar.
{107279}{107341}Be nice to have somebody|to workwith down there.
{107371}{107448}Does this mean you're|gonna be gone more ?
{107451}{107505}Possibly, yeah.
{107558}{107652}You might want to pencil in|a little face time with your daughter.
{107655}{107721}- Barbara--|- Because I'm at the edge|of my capabilities, Robert.
{107723}{107799}I think it's important|we maintain a unified front.
{107801}{107853}If you start in|on the war metaphors,
{107855}{107905}I'm gonna drive this car|into a telephone pole.
{107908}{107993}- I am as worried as you are.|- Oh, I don't think so.
{107996}{108042}"Leave me alone.|Give me some money."
{108044}{108100}That's what I get|from our daughter.
{108102}{108188}She has a way of shutting me out|that seems very familiar.
{108190}{108309}Well, she has a way of self-medicating|that I'm sure is very familiar to you.
{108365}{108413}I'm not the one who has|to have three scotches...
{108416}{108462}just to walk in the house|and say hello.
{108464}{108541}I have one drink before dinner|to take the edge off. It's different.
{108544}{108644}-Oh, is it ?|-Otherwise, I would be dying of boredom.
{109046}{109138}Why don't you go in and tell|your daughter how bored you are ?
{110492}{110569}Caroline, open this door immediately.
{110572}{110648}Who is it ?|I'm going to the bathroom.
{110650}{110706}- Open the goddamn door !|- One minute.
{110876}{110929}Excuse me.|I have to go to bed.
{111006}{111067}Oh, Jesus.
{111188}{111246}You are not going anywhere, young lady.
{111248}{111325}You stay right there.
{111463}{111510}Where are they ?
{111540}{111586}Where the hell are the drugs ?
{111588}{111637}Where are they ?
{111640}{111686}Fuck you.
{111689}{111736}Fuck you.
{111737}{111837}I wasn't doing anything.|You're like the Gestapo.
{111840}{111947}Fuck me. Fuck me.|Well, fuck you !
{113134}{113188}- Javier, good to see you.|- How you doing, partner ?
{113191}{113265}Did you take the precautions|we discussed about being followed ?
{113268}{113321}- Yes, of course.|- Will you move to the middle, please ?
{113324}{113370}- You're not carrying a weapon ?|- No.
{113372}{113430}- Of course not.|- Where are you taking me ?
{113432}{113502}- Somewhere safe.|- Where ?
{113504}{113569}A place we have that we know|is protected. He's good. Let's go.
{113571}{113624}- No, no. No, no, no.|- Don't worry. It's really safe.
{113626}{113691}No, no, no, no, no.|This is safe. This is safe.
{113694}{113753}Come on, Javier, close the door.|Everything is cool, all right ?
{113756}{113821}- This is safe.|- Come on.
{113825}{113882}Allright.
{113884}{113945}Where would you like to go ?
{113947}{114027}- Huh ?|- Where do you want to go, Javier ?
{114243}{114355}I believe it's|important that we work together.
{114358}{114445}Mexico and the United States.|One hand washing the other.
{114448}{114517}We agree.
{114519}{114591}So, maybe you can tell me|about your informants in our operations.
{114657}{114742}We thought that maybe you'd have|that kind of information for us.
{114776}{114874}This is a very different|proposition, my friend.
{114876}{114950}We pay for that kind|of information.
{114953}{115037}Is that what|you're talking about, Javier?
{115039}{115090}Getting paid ?
{115172}{115219}You like baseball ?
{115286}{115418}We need lights for the parks|so kids can play at night.
{115448}{115506}So it's safe.
{115508}{115581}So they can play baseball.
{115583}{115655}So they no become--
{115657}{115703}Everybody like baseball.
{115705}{115776}Everybody likes parks.
{115778}{115860}Listen.
{115863}{115958}I believe it's important that|the United State take an interest...
{115960}{116010}in Tijuana now.
{116060}{116144}That's what I'm talking about,|my friends.
{116156}{116205}Accountnumber...
{116209}{116330}8201-4302-8091...
{116333}{116386}2431.
{116429}{116478}A cash advance.
{116620}{116683}How much can I get ?
{116741}{116787}That's it ?
{116883}{116934}You ever try the patch, man ?
{116936}{116982}- The what ?|- The patch.
{116984}{117074}- That shit doesn't work, bro.|- It worked for my cousin.
{117076}{117146}- No shit ?|- Yeah.
{117147}{117209}He had to wear five or six|at a time, but it worked.
{117212}{117271}- So, how's he doing now ?|- Oh, he's dead.
{117305}{117380}- He's dead ?|- It wasn't from the patch, man.
{117382}{117445}- Okay, she's coming out.|- On it.
{117448}{117518}- What did he die from ?|- His wife shot him.
{117520}{117607}She's leaving her property.
{117610}{117654}Where the hell is she going ?
{117660}{117707}Maybe her neighbors.
{117708}{117786}No, I don't think the neighbors|are fucking with her too much|right about now.
{117789}{117849}What does she have|in her hand there ?
{117885}{117994}She seems to be headed for the van.
{118124}{118170}Oh, shit.
{118172}{118269}- What-- Wh-What do we do ?|- I-l don't know. What do we do ?
{118272}{118316}- What do you think she wants, man ?|- She's your girlfriend.
{118319}{118367}You think she'll invite you|to her baby shower?
{118369}{118415}-Just say hello. Work it.|- All right, all right, all right.
{118417}{118470}She's waiting outside the van.
{118473}{118534}- Hello ?|- Would you like some lemonade ?
{118537}{118634}- I was just making some.|- You want some lemonade ?
{118637}{118683}Sure.
{118685}{118785}I knowt his is a difficult situation,|and you're only doing your jobs.
{118789}{118871}I don't wish you guys|any ill will or anything like that.
{118873}{118923}But I have a favor to ask you.
{118927}{118978}You're asking us for a favor ?
{118981}{119034}Some man threatened my child.
{119037}{119083}These charges have created|so much attention,
{119085}{119182}it seems to be bringing|all the nutjobs out of the nutjar.
{119185}{119255}Would you keep an eye out|for anything out of the ordinary ?
{119283}{119339}- Sure.|- Yeah, of course we will.
{119341}{119402}- I'd really appreciate it.|- Sure.
{119405}{119466}- Thanks.|- Thank you for the lemonade.
{119470}{119527}You're welcome.
{119685}{119767}I'm gonna get this analyzed|right away, bro.
{119835}{119907}So, it was my birthday...
{119909}{119978}and my ex-wife|was getting remarried...
{119980}{120051}and I was in some church basement|telling a bunch of strangers...
{120053}{120100}it was a good day because...
{120103}{120159}I didn't have to eat|out of a Dumpster.
{120193}{120263}That was enough to send me|out on a pretty big one.
{120265}{120347}I've been thinking a lot|about the first step--
{120349}{120438}that I came to believe|I was powerless over alcohol...
{120441}{120490}and that my life|had become unmanageable.
{120493}{120575}My disease tells me|that I don't have a disease,
{120577}{120638}that it's my birthday|and I can have one little beer,
{120641}{120729}one little line,|a little Valium.
{120733}{120842}Six months later, I wake up|in a sober-living house in Philly.
{120846}{120906}I'm from Dallas, people.
{120909}{120994}It's a disease,|an allergy of the body,
{120997}{121056}an obsession of the mind.
{121057}{121110}So, my name is Marty,
{121113}{121210}and today I'm a grateful,|recovering alcoholic.
{121213}{121334}And it's a good day because I|didn't have to eat out of a Dumpster.
{121337}{121383}Thanks.
{121441}{121494}Hi.
{121529}{121638}I'm Caroline.|I'm not sure I'm an alcoholic.
{121641}{121750}I mean...|I don't really like to drink.
{121793}{121914}For someone my age, it's a lot easier|to get drugs than it is to get alcohol.
{122025}{122107}I guess I'm angry.
{122189}{122274}I mean, I think I'm really angry|about a lot of stuff.
{122278}{122372}I'm just... not sure what.
{123503}{123559}Listen to me.|I built our house...
{123561}{123614}and I'm not gonna lose it.
{123684}{123728}My business--
{123732}{123859}that would take a lot|of private study.
{123998}{124094}I suggest...|you look into the Coronel.
{124096}{124210}- The painting ?|- Into selling it.
{124213}{124264}If you can stomach it,
{124268}{124355}you should look into it.
{125450}{125495}Oh, my God.
{126854}{126925}Dear Judge,
{126927}{127022}I recruited the best men|in Mexico for my task force.
{127024}{127151}I make the selection, putting them|under a rigorous screening process.
{127153}{127262}And not only physically,|but also psychologically.
{127264}{127362}Judge, I'm sorry for boxes|and the paintings and things,
{127364}{127464}but I have been too busy|to completely settle in here.
{127467}{127531}I know you've made very good progress|with the Tijuana cartel.
{127534}{127586}- Congratulations, General.|- Muchas gracias.
{127589}{127690}I am confident|that before the end of the year,
{127692}{127771}Juan Obregon is gonna|be taken into custody.
{127773}{127887}But you must understand that it's|going to be a very difficult task...
{127890}{127977}because of the corruption|in the police force.
{127980}{128060}Hopefully, the exchange|of training methods and information...
{128062}{128116}between our two countries will help.
{128119}{128171}I hope so.
{128173}{128266}On another note, General,|we were talking about supply.
{128267}{128335}- Mm-hmm.|- What about demand ?
{128337}{128408}What are your policies|towards treatment of addiction ?
{128411}{128487}"Treatment of addiction."
{128489}{128543}Addicts treat themselves.
{128546}{128643}They overdose, and then there's|one less to worry about.
{128782}{128894}What I want you to do right now|is write down five triggers...
{128896}{128946}that could lead|to your relapse,
{128950}{129008}that could jeopardize|your recovery.
{129010}{129128}Five triggers.|Your parents, something they could say.
{129130}{129199}Anything that's a trigger for you.|It varies from person to person.
{129201}{129307}Some of us|have already discussed--
{129309}{129359}Linda, we talked about it|the other day.
{129362}{129408}I know you have trouble|with your sister,
{129410}{129502}how she's always|kind of outshining you.
{129712}{129780}Hey, sugarfoot,|how do you like your new home ?
{129853}{129948}- You got to be kidding me.|This is not what my lawyers negotiated.
{129951}{129996}Please. Fuck your lawyers.
{130000}{130064}You're not getting|any goddamn cappuccino or--
{130067}{130136}- Biscotti.|- Yeah, you ain't getting|none of that shit either.
{130139}{130188}- Pick a bed.|- Stay off the phone, Eddie.
{130191}{130238}No long-distance calls, all right ?
{130240}{130314}- Use 1-800-CRIMINAL if you do.
{130511}{130583}Mr. Ayala first came|to see me in January.
{130585}{130660}That would have been 1987.
{130663}{130743}He wanted to rent warehouse space|along the harbor.
{130745}{130844}I didn't ask too many questions.|I am a businessman also.
{130848}{130956}I was the company's secretary|from 1991 to 1994.
{130959}{131060}I supposedly worked for all|six companies, but they weren't--
{131063}{131164}I mean, it was just an empty office|with a desk and a telephone.
{131167}{131237}I never sold anything|the whole time I was there.
{131240}{131319}Sometimes people came in,|and they got paid.
{131321}{131388}I-I don't really know|what they did.
{131391}{131505}- Didn't Mr. Ayala|say where the money came from ?|- No.
{131507}{131628}-Did you ask where the money came from ?|-No.
{131631}{131680}Where do you think it came from ?
{131683}{131740}- Objection. Speculation.|- Sustained.
{131742}{131800}I'll rephrase, Your Honor.
{131803}{131924}Did you feel like you were engaged|in a legitimate enterprise ?
{131964}{132037}No, not really.
{132102}{132148}Thank you.
{132792}{132856}You were followed by the police,
{132860}{132975}but they won't be able|to hear us over the children.
{133025}{133108}I want to use a bomb.
{133188}{133237}Are you kidding ?
{133240}{133304}Can't you just shoot him|or something ?
{133343}{133396}I don't really like guns.
{133399}{133456}You shoot somebody in the head|two, three times...
{133459}{133572}and some pinche doctor|is trying to keep him alive.
{133620}{133692}When are you gonna do it ?
{133695}{133740}I don't know.
{133804}{133915}Eduardo Ruiz is the only|real witness against Carl.
{133917}{133964}Security will be very tight.
{134019}{134147}- I may not be able to get to him.|- You'll be able to get to him.
{134149}{134236}If they can get to|the pope and the president,|you can certainly get to him.
{134287}{134396}Careful. You're starting to sound|like your husband, Mrs. Ayala.
{134904}{134984}Nobody saw her leave ?
{134987}{135045}Hmm.
{135048}{135104}No, I understand.
{135108}{135168}Okay.
{135241}{135301}I gotta go.
{135304}{135373}I've got to go home.
{135375}{135445}Did you want me to resch--
{135448}{135508}Fine.
{135828}{135910}What's going on? You seem nervous.
{135913}{135966}- Because of Manolo.
{135968}{136049}I'm afraid he'll do something foolish|and it's going to get him killed.
{136051}{136086}Why?
{136088}{136159}He says he's going|to sell information to the DEA.
{136161}{136236}They're going to pay him|a lot of money.
{136294}{136364}What could he tell the DEA?
{136375}{136414}You know...
{136416}{136464}about Salazar and Madrigal.
{136688}{136733}Javier.
{136817}{136868}Where is he right now?
{136893}{136990}I don't know.|He took his passport and left.
{137097}{137153}Give me a kiss.
{137155}{137181}Don't tell him that I told you.
{137184}{137229}No.
{137943}{138033}What you want ? Pot ? Rock ?|Hey, what you want ?
{139200}{139277}- Fuck !
{139672}{139733}What the fuck do you want ?
{140424}{140469}Yeah.
{143701}{143785}It has come to our attention that|Your Honor, while in private practice,
{143788}{143842}previously represented|the town of Seal Beach...
{143845}{143913}in their stop-work suit against|the police department of Seal Beach.
{143917}{143977}We believe this disqualifies you|from hearing this case,
{143980}{144074}and we, therefore, move for a temporary|suspension until it's investigated.
{144078}{144129}Mr. Adler, this is|a most unusual motion.
{144132}{144178}Nonetheless, Your Honor,
{144180}{144257}we feel our client deserves|every fairness afforded under the law.
{144260}{144380}I hope this is not in anyway designed|to delay the testimony of Eduardo Ruiz.
{144492}{144557}We will recess until 9:00 a.m.|on Monday morning,
{144559}{144656}and I will see counsel|in my chambers.
{145056}{145114}They are coming this way.
{145195}{145260}All of them are there.
{145263}{145328}They are passing me now.
{145469}{145540}Boy, there's a lot of them.
{145542}{145658}Listen, would you mind if we|walked back to the hotel today ?
{145660}{145726}- Walk back ?|- Yeah.
{145821}{145873}They're not getting into the car.
{145909}{145965}What are they doing ?
{145967}{146021}They're arguing or something.
{146090}{146146}It's two blocks.|I could use the fresh air.
{146149}{146207}I've been stuck in that piece of shit|hotel room for two weeks.
{146210}{146273}I don't give a fuck.|Let's just stop standing around.
{146274}{146326}- I want to walk 'cause I want to walk,|not 'cause he wants to walk.|- Let's walk.
{146329}{146375}I like that.|Okay, we'll walk.
{146446}{146500}They're going past me.
{146589}{146696}I-I-I do not know. I think|they're going back to the courthouse.
{146698}{146819}This could be the last chance|to do this ! Get out of the car|and shoot him in the head !
{147279}{147326}You're a fucking big man ?
{147329}{147455}I'm a real fucking man. I don't fucking|deal drugs to little fucking kids, you--
{147544}{147581}Fucking rat.
{147584}{147656}- You think you're a badass ?|- I am a badass !
{147701}{147788}Move, move ! Get down !
{147971}{148036}- Go, go, go!|We need an ambulance.|- Go, go, go.
{148729}{148795}Ray. Ray ! Ray !|Wait a minute, Ray !
{149929}{149986}Manolito, Manolito, Manolito.
{149995}{150046}What's up, Manolo?
{150094}{150157}Looks like you're waiting|for someone.
{150161}{150209}I'm just looking for the waitress.
{150226}{150281}I'm ready to order.|Do you want anything?
{150284}{150352}A fucking salad?|Something to drink?
{150355}{150426}No, no. Calm down, calm down.
{150428}{150523}What are you gonna have, Manolito?
{150589}{150638}A steak.
{150687}{150737}Well, if you like steak...
{150740}{150801}we know a much better place.
{150809}{150867}You come with us.
{151546}{151614}Javier had nothing to do with this.
{151647}{151707}It was all my idea.
{151783}{151841}Punish me, not him.
{151955}{152014}Do me a favor.
{152091}{152148}Don't tell Ana I died like this.
{152200}{152285}Tell her it was something else.
{152318}{152381}Something official.
{152506}{152566}Tell her I died|doing something worthy.
{152646}{152700}Forgive me, Javi.
{152879}{152937}Put some muscle into it.
{152963}{153012}You too, Manolo.
{153192}{153248}You're done.
{153250}{153296}- Get out of there.|- Don't you hear?
{153298}{153378}Javier, put the shovel down.
{153416}{153480}Get out. Let's go.
{153516}{153577}I told you it wasn't his fault.
{153579}{153622}Shut up.
{153728}{153780}Turn around.
{154153}{154207}Let's go, Javier. It's over.
{154604}{154682}Don't be alarmed, Javier.
{154686}{154741}The old man works like this.
{154744}{154818}We had to go|through the same thing.
{154860}{154945}We had to do this|to be sure we could trust you.
{154954}{155002}Now we see that we can.
{155005}{155071}We are family now.
{156575}{156631}Sorry about the other night.
{156678}{156722}Me too.
{159797}{159935}Thank you for coming down here, though I|suspect it has been a pointless journey.
{159938}{160033}- Why would you say that ?|- Bueno, pues, I hear these stories.
{160035}{160115}Your husband in jail,|his business in chaos,
{160117}{160193}various people fighting|over the scraps.
{160196}{160286}My husband was a victim of an informer|in your organization, not in ours.
{160288}{160350}That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.
{160354}{160420}Your route has been compromised.
{160424}{160504}Perhaps it is time for me to deal|with other distributors in California.
{160507}{160558}- I don't think you're gonna do that.|- You don't ?
{160561}{160626}- No.
{160629}{160742}My husband was working on something|he called the Project for the Children.
{160746}{160886}- Are you aware of this ?|- I don't know.|Perhaps I remember something.
{160970}{161078}If you want to smuggle narcotics|in Senor Espastico Jacobo,
{161082}{161135}that is nothing new, Senora.
{161137}{161227}No, not in.|The doll is cocaine.
{161229}{161323}High impact,|pressure-molded cocaine.
{161370}{161442}It's odorless,|undetectable by the dogs.
{161445}{161515}- Undetectable by anyone.
{161517}{161572}I don't believe you, senora.
{162152}{162216}I'm six months pregnant.
{162219}{162265}I won't do it.
{162267}{162348}- Then we don't have a deal.|- Yeah, right.
{162350}{162407}We don't have a deal.
{162435}{162519}Sorry to waste your time,|Mr. Obregon.
{162558}{162604}Okay.
{162606}{162652}Okay, okay.
{162873}{162955}- That's good coke.|- It should be. It's yours.
{163000}{163044}I want our debt forgiven,
{163048}{163154}I want to be the exclusive|distributor of Obregon brothers'|cocaine in the United States,
{163157}{163271}and I want the principal witness against|my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
{163437}{163508}Have you told the complete truth|during this interview ?
{163562}{163627}Yes.
{163656}{163719}- Alex ?|- Solid.
{163721}{163780}- That's good shit, Javier.|- You know, Javier,
{163782}{163843}they dump those cell phones|every 24 hours.
{163845}{163930}Yes, but I have|a contact at MexTel...
{163934}{164035}who can get me|his new E.S.N. in 12 hours.
{164037}{164084}That's good to know.
{164182}{164252}So, now that you have|what you want,
{164254}{164330}let's talk about how|I get what I want.
{164334}{164387}Oh, you don't have|to worry about that.
{164390}{164455}You're not gonna have|any problems there.
{164458}{164563}Yeah, but first let's talk|about what precautions you're|taking to protect yourself.
{164564}{164659}You worry about getting me|what I want.
{164663}{164720}I'll worry about myself.
{164832}{164939}Oye, Javier,|you should feel good about this.
{165018}{165076}I feel like a traitor.
{167142}{167243}Helena Ayala just left Club Platinum,|the Obregon brothers' place in Tijuana.
{167246}{167295}- Yeah ?|- She got stopped at the border.
{167298}{167404}She was clean,|and she's back in San Diego now.
{167406}{167452}Okay.
{167698}{167787}- Hello ?|- Robert, it's Jeff Sheridan.
{167790}{167844}- D-Did I wake you ? I'm sorry.|- No, it's okay.
{167847}{167896}General Salazar has been arrested.
{167898}{167956}It turns out he has been working|for Porfirio Madrigal...
{167959}{168007}and the Juarez cartel|the entire time.
{168011}{168087}That is why he was trying to push|the Obregons out of Tijuana...
{168090}{168143}- so he and Madrigal could move in.|- What ?
{168147}{168218}I thought Madrigal was dead.|I thought that had been verified.
{168220}{168299}Apparently not. It is a shitstorm here,
{168302}{168399}but the D.E.A. supplied the information|and was part of the sting.
{168402}{168484}So, maybe we can spin this a little,|but I don't know what to tell people.
{168486}{168563}-So, when are you coming back ?|-I'll try to get there as soon as I can.
{168566}{168620}- Yeah, okay, but--|- Robert.
{168623}{168728}Robert ? Robert ?
{168730}{168784}I gotta call you back.
{168787}{168833}- What--
{168943}{169064}- My Leica's missing.|- She got the video camera too.
{169067}{169140}At least we know she's still alive.|Where are you going ?
{169142}{169239}Pawn shops open in an hour. Ten minutes|after that, she'll be at her dealer.
{169242}{169328}If I can find him,|I should be able to find her.
{169561}{169659}Although|ser and estar both mean "to be,"
{169662}{169755}they have very specific uses.
{169757}{169828}May I help you, sir ?
{169944}{169987}Excuse me!
{169990}{170073}Seth has to be excused.|He's going on a field trip.
{170219}{170308}I can't believe you brought|my daughter to this place.
{170350}{170463}Whoa, whoa. Why don't you just|back the fuck up, man ?
{170466}{170516}"To this place" ?
{170519}{170572}What is that shit ?
{170574}{170644}Okay, right now, all over|this great nation of ours,
{170646}{170712}100,000 white people from the suburbs|are cruising around downtown...
{170714}{170804}asking every black person,|"You got any drugs ? You know|where I can score some drugs ?"
{170807}{170901}Think about the effect that has|on the psyche of a black person,|on their possibilities.
{170902}{170999}I-- God, I guarantee you,|you bring 100,000 black people|into your neighborhood,
{171001}{171104}and they're asking every white|person, "You got any drugs ?|Know where I can score some ?"
{171107}{171207}Within a day, everyone would be|selling--your friends, their kids.
{171210}{171300}Here's why: It's an unbeatable market|force, man. It's a 300% markup value.
{171302}{171371}You can go out on the street|and make $500 in two hours,
{171372}{171420}come back and do whatever you want|with the rest of your day.
{171422}{171533}You're telling me that white people|would still be going to law school ?
{172127}{172204}- What do you want ?|- I'm looking for my daughter.
{172206}{172252}Caroline.
{172254}{172312}She's been here.
{172314}{172363}This is a business, man.|Why don't you get the fuck out ofhere ?
{172367}{172461}I need to find my daughter, all right ?|I'll pay you.
{172487}{172564}All right.|Okay. Hold on.
{172639}{172739}Who in the fuck do you think you are ?|Where the fuck do you think you are ?
{172743}{172864}- Why the fuck shouldn't I just|put your ass in a Dumpster ?|- I got money.
{172867}{172928}- I got money !|- I got $1,000 in my wallet.
{172931}{173028}- It's for you.|- If I want your money, man,|I will take your money.
{173083}{173144}Just tell me|where my daughter is.
{173147}{173205}Please ? Please ?
{173339}{173391}Don't do that shit again.
{173547}{173660}Look, Jesus, man, I'm telling you,|don't do this vigilante thing.
{173663}{173736}Either the cops are gonna find her,|or she's gonna call you.
{173739}{173785}Okay ?
{173787}{173833}I promise.
{174514}{174560}Ana.
{174597}{174665}If Manolo hadn't done what he did...
{174687}{174792}they wouldn't have been able|to get Salazar and Madrigal.
{174902}{174964}He did something really good.
{175037}{175130}What's more, he did|something important for Tijuana.
{175167}{175225}I would like to believe you.
{175408}{175491}You don't have to believe me...
{175542}{175593}because it's the truth.
{175623}{175681}The simple truth.
{176071}{176137}Tomorrow I'm going|to burn his clothes.
{177284}{177359}I know she's in there.|Just let me talk to her.
{177361}{177429}Look, I know she's in there, man!
{177431}{177492}No, I fucking know she's in there !
{177583}{177636}Jesus Christ !
{177638}{177702}I-I haven't touched her.
{177844}{177921}You get the fuck|out of here right now.
{178231}{178277}Hi.
{178436}{178488}Hi, Daddy.
{178564}{178616}Hi, sweetheart.
{179420}{179496}Hey, good morning, Eddie.
{179499}{179548}- Good morning.|- Big day.
{179584}{179692}You're a star.
{179696}{179753}Why don't you go take a shower, man ?|You smell.
{179803}{179892}- Who is it ?|- It's the Mafia.
{179894}{179973}- I've got his breakfast.|- Coming.
{180063}{180109}- So who's this going to ?|- Over here.
{180295}{180366}- Ooh.|- Fuck off.
{180369}{180471}- Relax, Eddie.|- Yeah, where has the love gone ?|Good-bye.
{180516}{180565}You know, you're gonna be testifying|for about ten days.
{180568}{180621}We could just decide|to stop feeding your ass.
{180623}{180717}You expect me to be grateful|for spending the rest of my life|looking over my shoulder ?
{180719}{180809}Wow, that's--|that's heavy, Eddie.
{180876}{180965}Can't you for one second imagine|that none of this had happened,|that my drugs had gone through ?
{180968}{181014}What would be the harm ?
{181016}{181068}Huh ? What would be the harm ?
{181072}{181137}A few people get high|who are getting high anyway.
{181139}{181212}Your partner's still alive.
{181216}{181298}We don't have to have|breakfast together.
{181300}{181349}Don't you see this means nothing ?
{181351}{181405}Your whole life is pointless.
{181436}{181493}You're really breaking my heart.
{181539}{181673}- The worst part about you, Monty--|- "Monty" ?
{181676}{181722}The worst part about you, Monty,
{181724}{181804}is you realize the futility of what|you're doing, and you do it anyway.
{181806}{181873}Wish you could see|how transparent you are.
{181876}{181927}This food tastes like shit.
{181930}{182021}So, take your stank ass|and go get a shower already.
{182068}{182114}Let me tell you something.
{182116}{182186}You only got to me because you|were tipped off by the Juarez cartel...
{182188}{182234}who's trying to break into Tijuana.
{182236}{182318}- You are helping them. Uh-huh.|- Mmm.
{182320}{182393}So, remember, you work|for a drug dealer too, Monty.
{182426}{182474}- Fuck me.
{182476}{182546}- Who is it ?|- Breakfast.
{182608}{182654}Hurry up.|It's getting cold.
{182767}{182813}Okay. One second.
{182843}{182905}- Get the fuck down !|- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey !
{182907}{182993}- Get down ! Get the fuck down !|- Hey, hey, I'm on your side !
{182994}{183071}- What the fuck ?|- Oh, shit. Call an ambulance.
{183074}{183145}- Call an ambulance ! Fuck !|- Palms up.|Spread your damn hands out.
{183148}{183221}- Shit ! Eddie !
{183282}{183332}Hold on.
{183334}{183411}Oh, shit !|Hurry up with that ambulance !
{183414}{183477}Shit. Hold on. Hold on.
{183544}{183633}Your Honor, ladies|and gentlemen of the jury,
{183636}{183730}because of the sudden death|of Eduardo Ruiz,
{183732}{183835}the people have determined|that we cannot continue our case|against Carl Ayala.
{183894}{183966}Oh ! Oh !
{184026}{184081}Thank you so much.|Thank you, thank you.
{186609}{186668}- Yeah ?
{186670}{186718}Hi.
{186745}{186826}I got a copy of your speech.
{186828}{186893}It's fantastic.
{186896}{186958}So, Robert, my genuine thanks.
{186961}{187011}You're my choice.|You're gonna be great.
{187014}{187081}The president's sorry he hasn't been|able to spend more time with you.
{187084}{187170}After the press conference,|he wants to really sit down.
{187172}{187273}Oh, and I got to the Post too.
{187276}{187341}Don't worry about that thing|with your daughter. It's not news.
{187344}{187445}They're willing to treat it|as a family matter, personal matter.
{187449}{187543}Anyway, if it came out,|we could turn it into a qualification.
{187545}{187594}"I've been in the trenches|of the drug war.
{187596}{187666}I've seen the face of the enemy.|Etcetera, etcetera. "
{187668}{187784}A sterling reputation|and close friend of the president,
{187786}{187874}recently confirmed into the Office|of National Drug Control Policy,
{187877}{187990}our new drug czar,|Robert Hudson Wakefield.
{188241}{188325}The war on drugs is a war|that we have to win,
{188328}{188401}and a war that we can win.
{188403}{188541}We have to win this war to save|our country's most precious resource--
{188544}{188609}our children.
{188611}{188719}Sixty-eight million children|have been targeted...
{188721}{188793}by those who perpetrate this war...
{188829}{188948}and protecting these children|must be priority number one.
{189037}{189169}There has been progress,|and there has been failure.
{189172}{189253}But where we have fallen short,
{189255}{189337}I see not a problem,
{189340}{189430}I see an opportunity.
{189513}{189586}An opportunity...
{189589}{189725}to correct the mistakes...|ofthe past...
{189727}{189833}while laying a foundation|for the future.
{189968}{190027}This takes...
{190029}{190118}not only new ideas...
{190121}{190191}but perseverance.
{190193}{190332}This takes not only...|resources, but courage.
{190335}{190382}This takes...
{190385}{190461}not only... government,
{190464}{190526}but families.
{190573}{190622}I've laid out a--
{190704}{190799}I've laid out|a ten-point plan that--
{191161}{191207}I can't do this.
{191289}{191386}If there is a war on drugs,
{191389}{191486}then many of our family members|are the enemy.
{191569}{191694}And I don't know how you wage war|on your own family.
{192729}{192794}National Airport, please.
{193879}{193979}Hey, Arnie, it's Saturday.|You're working too hard, my friend.
{193981}{194058}Carl, I'm running late.|I'm coming right over.
{194060}{194179}No, no, no, don't bother, Arnie.|Let me ask you something.
{194181}{194251}When were you gonna tell me|about the $3 million...
{194253}{194360}we got in from San Francisco|two days after I was arrested ?
{194363}{194457}Um... I was waiting|for the right time.
{194460}{194538}Oh. You didn't think you could trust|my wife with that information ?
{194542}{194591}I didn't want to risk it.
{194593}{194654}That could have been frozen|along with everything else.
{194656}{194710}You had it all figured out,|didn'tyou ?
{194713}{194759}You were gonna move into my house,
{194761}{194847}raise my kids, sleep in my bed...
{194850}{194902}with my wife.
{194905}{194959}Sounds like a nice plan.
{194963}{195009}Oh, is it insane ?
{195012}{195074}Just think about it, okay ?|If I was gonna rip you off,
{195078}{195131}why wouldn't I just leave town|after Ruiz was killed ?
{195133}{195209}Why would I sit next to you|in court and listen to a dismissal ?
{195211}{195315}Let me ask you something.|You think there's a difference|between a reason and an excuse ?
{195318}{195378}'Cause I don't.
{195381}{195460}- Good-bye, Arnie.|- Carl--
{195463}{195510}Carl ?
{195697}{195750}Come on, sweetheart.
{195753}{195826}Come outside.|Everyone's waiting for you.
{195830}{195887}- Who was that ?|- Arnie. He's, uh--
{195889}{195943}- He can't make it to the barbecue.|- Oh.
{195945}{196006}- Come on.|- Hi, Helena.
{196047}{196093}- Hello.|- It's a great party.
{196095}{196150}- Who is he, a friend of yours ?|- Oh, I'm a nobody.
{196154}{196214}I'm the nobody who arrested you.
{196217}{196276}- You're--|- How you doing ?
{196278}{196335}- What are you doing in my house ?|- Oh, just looking around.
{196337}{196420}You got nice shit. Drug money|buys a lot of nice shit, Carl.
{196422}{196477}Listen, you don't want to talk|that way in my house.
{196480}{196530}You're fucking a murderer, Carl.
{196534}{196591}- Fuck you and fuck your wife.|- Hey, you can't be in here.
{196593}{196676}- Get him out.|- You put me out, Carl.
{196678}{196726}- I'm a cop.|- I don't care.
{196728}{196806}- Get out.|- Hey ! Hey, hey !
{196968}{197062}- Is that what you wanted ?|- A nice little bedtime story, Helena.
{197065}{197115}Tell him how you murdered|my partner !
{197118}{197178}- You got the wrong--|- His name was Ray Castro, Helena !
{197181}{197259}Ray Castro !|You remember that !
{197261}{197315}- What's his problem ?|- The carpet, sweetheart.
{197317}{197363}- No, no, no, I got it.|- I got it.
{197437}{197487}- Where did he come from ?|- Outside, honey.
{197650}{197695}What do you want to do, man ?
{198406}{198500}On the good days, I feel like I get it.
{198502}{198596}Like it all makes sense.
{198598}{198653}I can stay in the moment.
{198655}{198770}I don't have to control|everything in the future...
{198773}{198911}and I believe everything|is gonna work out fine.
{198989}{199035}O-On the bad days,
{199077}{199179}I just want to grab the phone|and start dialing numbers.
{199182}{199271}I want to pull my hair...
{199273}{199375}and run through|the streets screaming.
{199481}{199603}But thanks to the people|I've met in these rooms,
