1
00:02:33,575 --> 00:02:34,724
Go, girls!

2
00:03:14,055 --> 00:03:14,815
What are you up to?

3
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:16,696
- Let me go.
- What are you up to?

4
00:03:17,335 --> 00:03:18,295
What are you up to, kid?

5
00:03:19,735 --> 00:03:20,690
He's robbing him!

6
00:03:24,215 --> 00:03:25,284
Get outta here.

7
00:03:26,295 --> 00:03:27,364
Are you alright?

8
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:33,129
This is yours.

9
00:03:33,495 --> 00:03:35,087
Oh, fuck. Thanks.

10
00:03:36,575 --> 00:03:38,486
- Take it easy.
- Careful.

11
00:03:39,455 --> 00:03:41,047
Up. That's it.

12
00:03:45,495 --> 00:03:47,292
I'll call him now. Dad.

13
00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:48,723
He's always the same.

14
00:03:48,935 --> 00:03:51,688
Your father can't let it go.

15
00:03:52,575 --> 00:03:55,294
- Do you think Bruno's coming?
- I'll call him now.

16
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:09,414
What do you bet
the bad guy's still alive?

17
00:04:09,615 --> 00:04:11,255
What? They stuck
an iron bar in his chest,

18
00:04:11,455 --> 00:04:13,650
shot him
and threw a bomb at him.

19
00:04:16,015 --> 00:04:17,130
- Hi.
- Hi.

20
00:04:17,335 --> 00:04:18,165
What's up?

21
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:23,766
Hi.

22
00:04:25,815 --> 00:04:26,531
What's up?

23
00:04:27,495 --> 00:04:28,769
This is the good bit.

24
00:04:31,295 --> 00:04:32,887
- What's up, Rai?
- What's up, kid?

25
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,209
- You alright?
- Just a bit woozy.

26
00:04:37,415 --> 00:04:39,087
Sure you don't want to
go to hospital?

27
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,774
No, I just want to call my girl.

28
00:04:41,655 --> 00:04:44,215
I'll charge your mobile.
But get that cut cleaned?

29
00:04:59,895 --> 00:05:01,089
Want me to bring you back
an "ensaimada"?

30
00:05:01,295 --> 00:05:01,795
What?

31
00:05:01,895 --> 00:05:03,567
I'm going to lbiza tomorrow
to cover the electronic festival.

32
00:05:03,775 --> 00:05:05,735
- I could get you an "ensaimada".
- Wait a second.

33
00:05:05,815 --> 00:05:07,771
We're in the red, Dani.

34
00:05:07,935 --> 00:05:10,051
- This is no good.
- I'm not getting you anything.

35
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:13,890
Relax, I'm DJ-ing next week.

36
00:05:14,095 --> 00:05:16,006
- 'Bye.
- I'll pay back the money.

37
00:05:20,735 --> 00:05:22,885
Shit! Anyone heard from Bruno?

38
00:05:23,095 --> 00:05:24,164
Did he call here?

39
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,055
Weren't you having lunch
with your parents?

40
00:05:26,215 --> 00:05:29,048
Yes, but we waited an hour
and he didn't turn up.

41
00:05:29,255 --> 00:05:31,291
- It's weird.
- No, it's called being stood up.

42
00:05:35,055 --> 00:05:37,125
You think your girl's mad at you?

43
00:05:37,455 --> 00:05:39,252
No, but I bet she's worried.

44
00:05:39,775 --> 00:05:42,164
It's her parents that'll be
fucking pissed off.

45
00:05:42,615 --> 00:05:43,843
- Do you know them?
- Yeah.

46
00:05:44,055 --> 00:05:46,410
Carla and I have been together
since we were 16

47
00:05:46,615 --> 00:05:48,048
and shacked up for 3 years.

48
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:50,775
But they live in Sitges
and I hardly ever seen them.

49
00:05:52,175 --> 00:05:54,450
- Her dad can't stand me.
- Why?

50
00:05:55,415 --> 00:05:58,213
He'd rather Carla went out
with an architect or something.

51
00:05:59,415 --> 00:06:01,326
- He's French.
- Fuck him.

52
00:06:04,455 --> 00:06:06,366
The bad thing is
they're in Barcelona today.

53
00:06:06,975 --> 00:06:11,127
- And they've taken over your place.
- Well, it's actually "their" flat.

54
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,134
Fuck.

55
00:06:15,415 --> 00:06:16,768
If I were you,
I wouldn't go there tonight.

56
00:06:16,935 --> 00:06:19,449
I've got to apologize in person.

57
00:06:19,655 --> 00:06:22,931
Stop it, Mum,
you're worrying me even more.

58
00:06:25,055 --> 00:06:26,852
Guess where I'm going tomorrow!

59
00:06:28,895 --> 00:06:30,533
To lbiza, to cover the festival.

60
00:06:30,735 --> 00:06:33,329
And to get away from you,
It's as if we're an item.

61
00:06:34,335 --> 00:06:36,849
Chill out, it's all-expenses-paid.

62
00:06:38,455 --> 00:06:40,366
If you leave home
and check in together,

63
00:06:40,575 --> 00:06:43,806
probably on the plane
you'll be sitting... together.

64
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:47,729
Fuck no! Not lbiza!

65
00:06:49,895 --> 00:06:51,374
We'll talk later, okay?

66
00:06:51,815 --> 00:06:52,565
Hello?

67
00:06:53,255 --> 00:06:54,449
Yeah, Bruno.

68
00:06:56,055 --> 00:06:58,046
She's right here.
I'll put her on.

69
00:06:58,695 --> 00:06:59,411
'Bye.

70
00:07:00,455 --> 00:07:02,525
- What happened to you?
- You wouldn't believe me.

71
00:07:02,735 --> 00:07:05,010
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

72
00:07:06,695 --> 00:07:09,493
No, no. I feel bad that you
had to take the fallout alone.

73
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:14,131
Alright.

74
00:07:15,815 --> 00:07:16,691
Yeah, yeah.

75
00:07:17,655 --> 00:07:19,247
'Bye. Big kiss.

76
00:07:21,215 --> 00:07:22,091
Everything okay?

77
00:07:22,455 --> 00:07:24,047
I've got an amazing girlfriend.

78
00:07:24,335 --> 00:07:27,611
She says not to go home tonight
to avoid a row with her parents.

79
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:29,564
Stay here if you like.

80
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:32,448
No, I've bothered you enough.

81
00:07:33,095 --> 00:07:34,892
People crash here every day.

82
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:38,615
I am getting tired.

83
00:07:38,975 --> 00:07:41,887
I don't know if it's the bump
or the spliff.

84
00:07:48,095 --> 00:07:50,655
Here.
In case you want to change.

85
00:07:51,455 --> 00:07:52,604
Thanks.

86
00:08:07,095 --> 00:08:09,814
Fine, alright. See you later.

87
00:08:13,175 --> 00:08:16,212
Your father.
He's tied up at the meeting.

88
00:08:16,415 --> 00:08:17,848
We're not to wait up.

89
00:08:18,015 --> 00:08:19,414
If I'd known that...

90
00:08:19,615 --> 00:08:21,935
First he stands us up for dinner,
now he's not even coming.

91
00:08:22,095 --> 00:08:25,724
He's working.
Bruno's the one who's got a nerve.

92
00:08:25,935 --> 00:08:27,368
He lives here in our house,

93
00:08:27,535 --> 00:08:29,890
and doesn't say hello
or even apologize.

94
00:08:30,095 --> 00:08:31,494
Mum, he had an accident.

95
00:08:31,695 --> 00:08:33,731
Yes, as if I believe that.

96
00:08:40,655 --> 00:08:42,532
He just doesn't want to see us.

97
00:08:42,735 --> 00:08:43,850
Don't start.

98
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:48,084
- What's that pill for?
- To sleep. I've got insomnia.

99
00:08:48,415 --> 00:08:51,248
You? You sleep like a log!

100
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,252
Because I take the pill.

101
00:09:00,055 --> 00:09:01,408
It's for depression.

102
00:09:01,615 --> 00:09:03,492
You always struck me as...

103
00:09:04,215 --> 00:09:05,489
melancholic.

104
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,648
He won't let it go.
That's good reflexes.

105
00:09:13,415 --> 00:09:14,928
He's really cute.

106
00:09:25,175 --> 00:09:26,813
Grab it, he'll burn himself.

107
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,005
What are you people doing here?

108
00:10:06,295 --> 00:10:08,365
Daddy, she's naked.

109
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,691
Guys, guys, get up!

110
00:10:12,055 --> 00:10:13,124
Let's call the police.

111
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,206
Rai! Rai!

112
00:10:18,655 --> 00:10:20,691
Rai, c'mon. We've got to go.

113
00:10:20,855 --> 00:10:22,573
- What's going on?
- The cops are coming.

114
00:10:22,775 --> 00:10:24,208
Hey, wake up!

115
00:10:27,815 --> 00:10:28,565
Shit, let's go!

116
00:10:28,975 --> 00:10:30,886
Hey, let's go.

117
00:10:40,335 --> 00:10:42,132
Hey, Rai, help me!

118
00:10:42,335 --> 00:10:43,456
Maria, take her on you bike.

119
00:10:43,695 --> 00:10:44,207
Go!

120
00:10:45,215 --> 00:10:46,536
We gotta go, the cops are coming.

121
00:10:51,535 --> 00:10:53,571
- What do I do?
- Take that.

122
00:10:54,095 --> 00:10:55,289
Out the window!

123
00:11:06,935 --> 00:11:08,732
Wait, wait, wait.

124
00:11:11,455 --> 00:11:12,604
I'm getting the Metro.

125
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:17,733
Well, we say goodbye here.

126
00:11:19,255 --> 00:11:21,689
I'd ask you home,
but you know how things are.

127
00:11:21,895 --> 00:11:23,044
Relax.

128
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,524
I'll take a walk around.

129
00:11:24,735 --> 00:11:26,771
When I get a mobile, I'll call you
and give you back the T-shirt.

130
00:11:26,975 --> 00:11:28,931
It's a gift... but call me.

131
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,254
And get that cut seen to.

132
00:11:36,735 --> 00:11:39,169
Hey, would you mind
changing neighbourhoods?

133
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:40,928
- What?
- Follow me.

134
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,094
Let's go.

135
00:11:46,735 --> 00:11:48,851
We pay them the months we owe
or they throw us out.

136
00:11:49,055 --> 00:11:51,808
- It's not my fault.
- I'm sick of telling people.

137
00:11:52,055 --> 00:11:53,886
We publish a free college rag,

138
00:11:54,055 --> 00:11:56,853
we're almost broke,
but he wants it all high-quality,

139
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,647
the printing, whatever.

140
00:11:58,815 --> 00:12:00,407
Plus we buy tickets to lbiza,

141
00:12:00,735 --> 00:12:03,203
the magazine goes belly up,
and I look like the bad guy.

142
00:12:03,415 --> 00:12:05,326
Where are the cartridges
for the printer?

143
00:12:06,055 --> 00:12:07,090
Marta's got them.

144
00:12:08,255 --> 00:12:11,008
- Why do you want them?
- Why else? To print.

145
00:12:11,175 --> 00:12:13,735
Yes, but is it for personal use?

146
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:16,290
Shit, it's for college.

147
00:12:16,495 --> 00:12:17,974
I don't earn a cent here

148
00:12:18,175 --> 00:12:19,927
and you tell me
I can't use the printer?

149
00:12:20,135 --> 00:12:22,695
We've only got two cartridges left
and we won't get any more!

150
00:12:22,895 --> 00:12:25,363
From now on, the money
comes out of our pockets.

151
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,486
They say we're stingy,

152
00:12:28,695 --> 00:12:30,811
but you're not from here
and you're such a tightwad.

153
00:13:04,695 --> 00:13:07,573
- People are living here. Let's go.
- Carla?

154
00:13:07,815 --> 00:13:08,327
Let's go!

155
00:13:08,535 --> 00:13:10,366
I'm at Adrian and Dani's place.

156
00:13:11,055 --> 00:13:12,454
You bastard.

157
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,569
No, I haven't seen them.

158
00:13:14,775 --> 00:13:16,572
They must've gone to lbiza.

159
00:13:20,495 --> 00:13:22,372
Yeah, through the patio door,

160
00:13:22,575 --> 00:13:24,293
the one they're always about to fix.

161
00:13:26,775 --> 00:13:28,493
No, I'm with a friend.

162
00:13:29,255 --> 00:13:30,529
Yes, the one who helped me.

163
00:13:32,215 --> 00:13:35,127
He's flat-hunting, so I thought
he could stay here meanwhile.

164
00:13:40,775 --> 00:13:41,924
Hold on.

165
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:44,291
Don't look at me like that.
What can I do?

166
00:13:44,495 --> 00:13:46,133
Just give me one.

167
00:13:54,775 --> 00:13:55,890
Who where you talking to?

168
00:13:58,015 --> 00:13:59,846
Why'd you cover the phone again?

169
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,484
Yeah, I bet he's flirting
with you, as usual.

170
00:14:06,135 --> 00:14:09,445
Don't get mad. I just wanted to know
if your parent's had gone.

171
00:14:11,415 --> 00:14:14,566
Fine, Yeah, yeah. 'Bye.

172
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:16,454
Jealousy.

173
00:14:16,735 --> 00:14:18,168
I don't think she's cheating on me.

174
00:14:18,575 --> 00:14:21,567
What bugs me is that
she might fancy other guys.

175
00:14:22,215 --> 00:14:23,887
Does that happen to you?

176
00:14:24,335 --> 00:14:25,609
Yes.

177
00:14:26,055 --> 00:14:28,933
But I put up with it.
Otherwise, what's love all about?

178
00:14:29,815 --> 00:14:32,045
It's about sharing ideas...

179
00:14:33,775 --> 00:14:35,925
wishes, experiences.

180
00:14:37,095 --> 00:14:38,813
But it doesn't put limits
on your life.

181
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,656
Still less on the lives of others.

182
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:45,205
But if there are no limits,
you're not a real partner...

183
00:14:46,615 --> 00:14:48,128
just another person.

184
00:14:49,495 --> 00:14:51,963
The couple should find
their own limits.

185
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:56,651
Sticking to the typical rules
doesn't improve the relationship.

186
00:14:57,295 --> 00:14:58,250
That's what I think.

187
00:14:58,735 --> 00:15:01,169
In a couple you have to be
special for the other person.

188
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,569
That's something else.

189
00:15:03,655 --> 00:15:04,610
You and I...

190
00:15:05,815 --> 00:15:07,009
We just met...

191
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:09,647
and you're already special to me.

192
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,605
When couples hide things,
it's all over.

193
00:15:20,815 --> 00:15:23,335
Your father knows I'm depressed,
I don't hide anything from him.

194
00:15:23,535 --> 00:15:25,253
Mum, you should live your own life.

195
00:15:25,535 --> 00:15:27,446
He does,
and without considering you.

196
00:15:27,655 --> 00:15:29,134
He's just busy all the time.

197
00:15:29,335 --> 00:15:30,893
Yes, with another woman.

198
00:15:31,095 --> 00:15:33,893
The woman you're talking about
is his architect, that's all.

199
00:15:34,095 --> 00:15:35,608
Why don't you separate?

200
00:15:36,495 --> 00:15:37,814
And be left alone?

201
00:15:38,015 --> 00:15:39,767
Mum, you're already alone.

202
00:15:40,055 --> 00:15:41,249
That's not true.

203
00:15:42,015 --> 00:15:43,767
Your father and I love each other.

204
00:15:44,575 --> 00:15:46,008
What's up?

205
00:15:48,935 --> 00:15:51,244
Marta said you were here
with your mother.

206
00:15:51,695 --> 00:15:52,650
Let me see...

207
00:15:53,655 --> 00:15:54,610
- It's sexy.
- Yeah.

208
00:15:57,895 --> 00:15:58,884
Hello, Nuria.

209
00:16:01,055 --> 00:16:01,726
Forgive me...

210
00:16:01,935 --> 00:16:03,050
for yesterday.

211
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:03,892
Hello, Bruno.

212
00:16:05,495 --> 00:16:07,690
- What happened to you?
- Mum, I told you!

213
00:16:07,895 --> 00:16:10,125
I'm sorry. I fainted,
I lost my mobile...

214
00:16:10,295 --> 00:16:11,853
No, please. Forgive "me".

215
00:16:12,215 --> 00:16:13,816
I thought it was an excuse
not to see us.

216
00:16:13,895 --> 00:16:15,965
I love seeing you.

217
00:16:16,415 --> 00:16:18,053
- Where's Gerard?
- Busy.

218
00:16:59,415 --> 00:17:00,814
What are you doing?

219
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:03,765
Wait, no.

220
00:17:05,695 --> 00:17:06,525
Wait.

221
00:17:07,455 --> 00:17:08,285
Wait, no.

222
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,210
Morning, babe.

223
00:17:24,415 --> 00:17:25,643
Good morning.

224
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:39,166
You do me in two minutes,
and it's goodbye?

225
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,206
When you're in a hurry,
you do the same thing.

226
00:17:41,575 --> 00:17:42,610
Where are you going?

227
00:17:43,055 --> 00:17:45,615
To fix breakfast.
I want to study.

228
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,726
- I've got an exam next month.
- Next month!

229
00:17:48,095 --> 00:17:50,450
Yes, my scholarship's at stake,
not like some people.

230
00:17:52,415 --> 00:17:53,211
Stay.

231
00:18:07,415 --> 00:18:10,407
One, two, three!

232
00:18:11,055 --> 00:18:13,808
One, two, three!

233
00:18:14,575 --> 00:18:17,567
One, two, three!

234
00:18:18,175 --> 00:18:19,130
More focus!

235
00:18:19,335 --> 00:18:22,088
One, two, three!

236
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:23,172
With a yell!

237
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,764
One, two, three!

238
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:29,807
One, two, three!

239
00:18:31,455 --> 00:18:32,365
Focus!

240
00:18:34,775 --> 00:18:36,003
Ready position!

241
00:18:37,975 --> 00:18:38,815
Stance with feet out!

242
00:18:54,215 --> 00:18:55,534
- Hi.
- How are you?

243
00:18:58,775 --> 00:19:00,493
Carla really wants to meet you.

244
00:19:00,975 --> 00:19:03,364
She's with a friend now,
so we'll hook up later.

245
00:19:04,535 --> 00:19:06,253
I don't feel like going out.

246
00:19:31,815 --> 00:19:32,964
No, that doesn't cut it.

247
00:19:33,855 --> 00:19:34,731
Let's go!

248
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,496
Let's leave it right there, okay?

249
00:20:20,735 --> 00:20:22,566
But you followed me
all over the island!

250
00:20:22,735 --> 00:20:25,533
And on the beach? You turned up
with your thingy in the air.

251
00:20:25,695 --> 00:20:27,651
- They said it was a nudist beach.
- Nudist...

252
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:31,209
- Hi.
- Hey, Bruno.

253
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:36,973
- How are you?
- Great.

254
00:20:37,335 --> 00:20:38,450
- Hi.
- You must be Rai.

255
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:39,849
- How are you?
- I'm Dani.

256
00:20:40,135 --> 00:20:41,648
And you're... Adrian.

257
00:20:42,535 --> 00:20:44,571
Thanks for the place.
I'll get my stuff and go.

258
00:20:44,855 --> 00:20:47,323
There's no need.
Stay as long as you like.

259
00:20:47,735 --> 00:20:50,124
We can empty the junk room,
right, Adrian?

260
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,373
Yes. Why not?

261
00:20:52,655 --> 00:20:53,690
Thanks a lot.

262
00:20:54,255 --> 00:20:55,813
Is she serious?

263
00:20:58,575 --> 00:21:00,088
No, we'd love to.

264
00:21:00,255 --> 00:21:02,371
Okay, we'll talk later.

265
00:21:02,815 --> 00:21:04,294
See you soon. Thanks.

266
00:21:04,695 --> 00:21:05,286
Yes!

267
00:21:05,775 --> 00:21:07,811
We're doing a piece
on Virginia Dalmau.

268
00:21:08,215 --> 00:21:09,694
- Can I take shots of her?
- Sure!

269
00:21:09,855 --> 00:21:11,208
They say she's got a temper...

270
00:21:11,415 --> 00:21:13,406
I love her!
She's such a diva, such a queen.

271
00:21:14,215 --> 00:21:15,170
Why the long face?

272
00:21:15,615 --> 00:21:17,173
This may be our last article,

273
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,569
do you realize that?

274
00:21:19,135 --> 00:21:20,887
We'll have to close before summer.

275
00:21:21,095 --> 00:21:25,486
The boss of the film distributor
that asked us to do the report

276
00:21:25,695 --> 00:21:29,244
on Dalmau's movie was my boss
on the last paper I worked for.

277
00:21:29,615 --> 00:21:30,491
And he says...

278
00:21:31,975 --> 00:21:34,569
he's interested in investing
in our magazine.

279
00:21:34,735 --> 00:21:35,235
What?!

280
00:21:35,415 --> 00:21:37,565
But only if he likes the article,

281
00:21:37,775 --> 00:21:40,369
especially the photos,
so there's a lot at stake.

282
00:21:57,615 --> 00:22:00,254
Are you sure your friend's coming?
Otherwise I'm ditching the high heels.

283
00:22:00,455 --> 00:22:02,207
I know all the Journalism students.

284
00:22:03,215 --> 00:22:05,135
Yeah? And you don't want to
do any of them again?

285
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:07,133
I'm the "mojito" king!

286
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,172
So, are you dressed to kill?

287
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:13,487
Yes, but don't worry,
you're not on my list.

288
00:22:13,815 --> 00:22:16,454
Fine, and don't get your hopes up.

289
00:22:24,695 --> 00:22:25,286
Hello.

290
00:22:27,135 --> 00:22:28,250
Hello, Carla.

291
00:22:29,735 --> 00:22:30,372
Rai?

292
00:22:30,775 --> 00:22:32,288
- How are you doing?
- Good.

293
00:22:32,495 --> 00:22:33,450
Nice to meet you.

294
00:22:34,455 --> 00:22:36,491
- This is Maria.
- Nice to meet you.

295
00:22:37,095 --> 00:22:38,975
- Carla, Bruno's girlfriend.
- Nice to meet you.

296
00:22:41,415 --> 00:22:43,053
- Rai!
- Hey there!

297
00:22:43,255 --> 00:22:44,893
- How are you doing?
- Great.

298
00:22:45,095 --> 00:22:46,369
- How's your eyebrow?
- Fine.

299
00:22:46,895 --> 00:22:48,886
- Bruno.
- Maria, you're still alive.

300
00:22:50,735 --> 00:22:52,771
- This is Carla, my girlfriend.
- Yes, we've been introduced.

301
00:22:53,015 --> 00:22:54,846
- Want to put your things away?
- Yes.

302
00:22:56,135 --> 00:22:57,966
- Hey, how are you?
- Great.

303
00:22:59,095 --> 00:23:00,448
I just fell in love.

304
00:23:00,935 --> 00:23:01,890
Introduce him to me.

305
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:05,048
Hold on, they just got here.
I'll introduce you later.

306
00:23:05,535 --> 00:23:07,207
- Like the place?
- Yeah.

307
00:23:08,135 --> 00:23:09,409
He's coming, he's coming.

308
00:23:14,335 --> 00:23:16,326
- For you.
- For me?

309
00:23:24,815 --> 00:23:26,965
It's Berlin, I was dancing there
with a friend.

310
00:23:28,335 --> 00:23:29,848
I don't know what to say.

311
00:23:30,615 --> 00:23:31,411
Like it?

312
00:23:31,615 --> 00:23:34,004
Of course! Thanks.

313
00:23:34,815 --> 00:23:36,851
I saw some of your photos
in the magazine.

314
00:23:38,575 --> 00:23:40,770
Most are just decoration.

315
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:43,843
Sometimes I put in
more personal ones.

316
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:45,693
You've got a special style.

317
00:23:45,975 --> 00:23:46,805
I like it.

318
00:23:55,535 --> 00:23:56,934
Your girlfriend's very cute.

319
00:23:58,455 --> 00:24:00,446
You should watch out.

320
00:24:01,095 --> 00:24:03,814
Yeah, so should you,
You're a bit wasted.

321
00:24:06,055 --> 00:24:07,408
Not wasted enough.

322
00:24:45,495 --> 00:24:46,928
Is she drunk, or what?

323
00:24:47,815 --> 00:24:50,409
- Maria, are you okay?
- Yes.

324
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:52,885
Let's go home.

325
00:24:53,655 --> 00:24:54,371
Shall we?

326
00:24:54,575 --> 00:24:55,610
Rai's wicked.

327
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:58,809
Marta's crazy about him,
and so am I.

328
00:24:59,335 --> 00:25:00,324
Oh, yeah?

329
00:25:04,175 --> 00:25:07,372
Guys, we're going.
She's spinning out.

330
00:25:07,735 --> 00:25:08,775
I'll take her on her bike.

331
00:25:12,895 --> 00:25:14,089
Is she his girlfriend?

332
00:25:14,295 --> 00:25:17,207
They did go out,
but now they're just friends.

333
00:25:19,135 --> 00:25:20,011
Look.

334
00:25:27,495 --> 00:25:29,133
You're getting off with Adrian!

335
00:25:31,775 --> 00:25:33,572
Oh, fuck.
They forgot their helmets.

336
00:25:45,535 --> 00:25:47,605
The helmets. Wait here.

337
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:57,531
Thanks.

338
00:25:59,735 --> 00:26:02,488
I like Carla.
She's a fucking great girl.

339
00:26:04,655 --> 00:26:06,088
It sucks that you have to go.

340
00:26:06,535 --> 00:26:08,014
You can see the shape Maria's in.

341
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:11,084
We didn't get a chance
to hang out together.

342
00:26:48,814 --> 00:26:50,645
- Hi.
- Hi.

343
00:26:50,854 --> 00:26:53,573
I came to give you back
the T-shirt you lent me.

344
00:26:57,534 --> 00:27:00,002
I gave it to you.
But if you don't want it...

345
00:27:05,614 --> 00:27:07,172
I made some coffee.

346
00:27:11,574 --> 00:27:12,689
How's Maria?

347
00:27:13,134 --> 00:27:14,089
Not too good.

348
00:27:16,214 --> 00:27:17,363
She takes too much shit.

349
00:27:18,894 --> 00:27:21,488
I convinced her to go to
a country house her sister's got.

350
00:27:27,774 --> 00:27:28,411
Come in.

351
00:27:28,854 --> 00:27:31,209
No, I'm going. I'm in a hurry.

352
00:27:37,854 --> 00:27:38,889
Listen, Rai...

353
00:27:40,254 --> 00:27:42,051
- About yesterday...
- Don't worry.

354
00:27:42,254 --> 00:27:43,528
It won't happen again.

355
00:27:47,494 --> 00:27:48,768
Unless you want it to.

356
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:42,567
Yes, put the green one on him.

357
00:28:47,734 --> 00:28:49,087
It's all under control.

358
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:52,366
It better be. You've no idea
how neurotic Virginia is,

359
00:28:52,534 --> 00:28:53,523
and how bossy!

360
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:54,855
She's only missing a willy.

361
00:28:57,534 --> 00:28:58,603
Yes! No, we'll wait.

362
00:28:59,134 --> 00:29:00,362
That's right.

363
00:29:01,734 --> 00:29:02,371
Thanks.

364
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,053
See you soon. 'Bye.

365
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:11,850
Virginia won't be here
for three hours or more.

366
00:29:12,054 --> 00:29:12,964
Shit! Why's that?

367
00:29:13,174 --> 00:29:14,766
She's a diva.
What did you expect?

368
00:29:14,974 --> 00:29:17,124
I might go to the pool
and see Bruno.

369
00:29:17,414 --> 00:29:19,325
I've been wanting to take
some photos of him swimming.

370
00:29:19,534 --> 00:29:20,205
Go on.

371
00:29:23,694 --> 00:29:25,889
Shall we have some coffee
and talk about the meeting?

372
00:29:26,654 --> 00:29:28,963
Listen, just because we got off
the other day

373
00:29:29,174 --> 00:29:30,766
doesn't mean we're an item.

374
00:29:30,934 --> 00:29:31,571
Okay?

375
00:29:34,014 --> 00:29:35,288
You're an idiot!

376
00:29:36,494 --> 00:29:38,530
I wanted to get off with Rai,

377
00:29:38,734 --> 00:29:40,531
but he split, I was horny...

378
00:29:42,534 --> 00:29:45,685
Next time you're horny,
use your fingers.

379
00:30:10,694 --> 00:30:13,572
Look at that guy swim.
Those arms!

380
00:30:14,374 --> 00:30:16,808
His arms around you
must be... Olympic.

381
00:30:18,094 --> 00:30:19,049
Look.

382
00:30:28,134 --> 00:30:30,284
- We'll wait for him outside. Hurry!
- Relax.

383
00:30:30,854 --> 00:30:33,971
While he's in the shower
we can enjoy the world of sports.

384
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,290
Did he go out some other way?

385
00:30:48,174 --> 00:30:51,007
Hang on.
I'll see if he's still inside.

386
00:32:15,054 --> 00:32:16,009
What's wrong?

387
00:32:19,894 --> 00:32:21,122
They were together.

388
00:32:22,094 --> 00:32:23,493
Together? Who?

389
00:32:23,654 --> 00:32:25,372
Bruno and Rai...

390
00:32:26,214 --> 00:32:27,613
in the shower.

391
00:32:28,134 --> 00:32:28,884
But...

392
00:32:33,334 --> 00:32:35,450
Don't tell anyone, please.

393
00:32:38,014 --> 00:32:39,606
The photo session with Virginia!

394
00:32:39,814 --> 00:32:40,883
Don't forget!

395
00:32:46,934 --> 00:32:48,003
Yes.

396
00:32:49,294 --> 00:32:52,411
No, I realize that.
No way, impossible.

397
00:32:53,814 --> 00:32:55,770
Yes. I'm asking you, please...

398
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,089
Alright, alright.

399
00:32:57,374 --> 00:32:58,489
Alright, alright.

400
00:32:59,614 --> 00:33:01,093
Thanks. 'Bye.

401
00:33:02,054 --> 00:33:03,612
What the fuck happened?

402
00:33:04,214 --> 00:33:07,206
Virginia's agent says
the photographer stood her up.

403
00:33:07,854 --> 00:33:09,970
Where's Carla?
I hope she's in the hospital.

404
00:33:10,174 --> 00:33:11,050
Watch it.

405
00:33:11,854 --> 00:33:14,652
We tried the hospital excuse
on Virginia

406
00:33:14,854 --> 00:33:17,414
- and she didn't buy it.
- She tore strips off me.

407
00:33:17,574 --> 00:33:19,610
The magazine depends on this job
and she can't even call!

408
00:33:19,814 --> 00:33:20,644
What's her deal?

409
00:33:21,014 --> 00:33:23,733
She should ask herself
if she really wants to stay with us.

410
00:33:23,934 --> 00:33:25,934
No, we should ask ourselves
if we want her to stay.

411
00:33:26,454 --> 00:33:28,922
She's going through
some tricky personal stuff.

412
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:31,090
- Oh, yeah? You don't say!
- Yes.

413
00:33:31,294 --> 00:33:32,568
And it's pretty heavy.

414
00:33:33,534 --> 00:33:35,286
But I can't tell you.

415
00:33:40,294 --> 00:33:41,283
Are you a homosexual?

416
00:33:41,454 --> 00:33:42,603
No, I'm not a homosexual.

417
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:45,806
Bruno, this is rough on me
but you have to accept it.

418
00:33:46,094 --> 00:33:48,369
Carla, I like women.
I like you!

419
00:33:48,734 --> 00:33:51,334
- Are you fooling me or yourself?
- No, I'm telling you the truth.

420
00:33:51,894 --> 00:33:52,531
I love you.

421
00:33:52,734 --> 00:33:54,770
Why didn't you tell me
if you love me so much?

422
00:33:55,454 --> 00:33:57,888
Didn't you think about me?
About us?

423
00:34:00,374 --> 00:34:02,524
I've put up with your fucking jealousy
all my life,

424
00:34:02,734 --> 00:34:04,611
and now you cheat on me!

425
00:34:04,814 --> 00:34:07,487
- Piss off!
- Fuck... I'm sorry.

426
00:34:08,414 --> 00:34:10,291
- Don't touch me!
- Take it easy.

427
00:34:12,214 --> 00:34:14,091
I didn't plan any of this.

428
00:34:14,814 --> 00:34:16,406
But I couldn't help it either.

429
00:34:18,334 --> 00:34:18,971
I don't know.

430
00:34:19,414 --> 00:34:22,611
I thought about not seeing Rai,
but I felt this unbearable anxiety.

431
00:34:22,974 --> 00:34:24,771
You sound like you're in love.

432
00:34:25,894 --> 00:34:27,213
No, this Rai thing is different.

433
00:34:27,934 --> 00:34:30,004
He's my friend.
I need to see him!

434
00:34:31,974 --> 00:34:33,327
It's like a drug.

435
00:34:34,214 --> 00:34:34,930
Is it sexual?

436
00:34:38,174 --> 00:34:40,130
Yes, it's sexual.

437
00:34:41,814 --> 00:34:43,805
Look, if I keep seeing him,
I'll get over it, and then...

438
00:34:44,014 --> 00:34:45,163
Then what?

439
00:34:46,014 --> 00:34:47,367
You fall for another guy?

440
00:34:47,574 --> 00:34:48,973
I told you, I'm not interested
in other guys!

441
00:34:49,174 --> 00:34:51,130
- How do you know?
- This Rai thing is different!

442
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:58,088
It's not just sexual.

443
00:35:03,414 --> 00:35:04,369
You've fallen in love.

444
00:35:04,654 --> 00:35:06,565
No, I'm in love with you.

445
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:10,893
I want to stay with you.

446
00:35:13,974 --> 00:35:16,090
Then don't see him again.

447
00:35:18,134 --> 00:35:21,524
If you love me,
don't see him anymore.

448
00:35:24,334 --> 00:35:25,289
I promise.

449
00:35:48,214 --> 00:35:49,966
- Hi.
- Hi.

450
00:35:51,534 --> 00:35:53,092
This is too heavy.

451
00:35:58,054 --> 00:36:00,284
It's fucking up my life,
and my head.

452
00:36:01,934 --> 00:36:04,607
Carla's the most
important thing to me.

453
00:36:05,574 --> 00:36:07,326
She's where I belong.

454
00:36:10,774 --> 00:36:12,765
We can't see each other any more.

455
00:36:15,334 --> 00:36:16,244
Okay.

456
00:36:19,014 --> 00:36:20,208
Okay, take it easy.

457
00:37:27,694 --> 00:37:28,729
I couldn't.

458
00:37:29,294 --> 00:37:29,885
What?

459
00:37:31,134 --> 00:37:33,489
I tried to, but I couldn't.

460
00:37:41,814 --> 00:37:43,645
Get your things and go.

461
00:38:04,014 --> 00:38:06,687
Fold you T-shirts right,
or they take up more space.

462
00:38:08,414 --> 00:38:11,850
I know I have to go,
but I already miss you.

463
00:38:13,534 --> 00:38:16,173
Where will you go?
What'll you do?

464
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:19,205
- Do you need money?
- No, no...

465
00:38:19,694 --> 00:38:20,604
I just need one thing.

466
00:38:20,774 --> 00:38:22,969
- Please hug me...
- No, no! Go!

467
00:38:38,254 --> 00:38:39,164
Hello.

468
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:44,454
Couldn't keep your mouth shut?

469
00:38:45,054 --> 00:38:46,282
I was sticking up for you.

470
00:38:56,654 --> 00:38:57,609
Forgive me.

471
00:38:58,214 --> 00:39:00,682
If you couldn't work,
you should've said so.

472
00:39:01,054 --> 00:39:02,328
We would've worked it out.

473
00:39:03,254 --> 00:39:05,165
What happened is very serious, Carla.

474
00:39:05,454 --> 00:39:07,174
We work on the magazine
for the love of art,

475
00:39:07,374 --> 00:39:09,046
and we do what we can to get by.

476
00:39:09,294 --> 00:39:11,728
We had a great chance,
but it's gone.

477
00:39:14,694 --> 00:39:18,607
I'll call the distributor.
I'll talk to Virginia somehow.

478
00:39:19,174 --> 00:39:20,163
I'm sorry...

479
00:39:22,334 --> 00:39:24,370
but don't turn your backs on me now.

480
00:39:25,094 --> 00:39:27,130
Don't you leave me too.

481
00:39:27,774 --> 00:39:29,526
No one's turning their back on you.

482
00:39:32,694 --> 00:39:34,924
Where's Bruno? At your place?

483
00:39:35,134 --> 00:39:35,850
No.

484
00:39:36,734 --> 00:39:39,931
When we said we'd kicked Rai
out of the flat, he got mad and left.

485
00:39:40,374 --> 00:39:42,012
- Where to?
- We don't know.

486
00:39:42,574 --> 00:39:43,768
He won't answer his phone.

487
00:39:44,134 --> 00:39:45,852
You should forget Bruno.

488
00:39:46,454 --> 00:39:48,774
He's out of the closet now,
so there'll be no stopping him.

489
00:39:49,414 --> 00:39:50,164
Give it time.

490
00:39:51,774 --> 00:39:52,524
Come here.

491
00:40:22,534 --> 00:40:25,970
My sister and her family
only come on some weekends.

492
00:40:26,534 --> 00:40:29,253
Stay as long as you like.

493
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:31,486
This is beautiful, Maria.

494
00:40:32,094 --> 00:40:34,449
Yeah, beautiful, and very boring.

495
00:40:34,654 --> 00:40:36,292
That's before we got here.

496
00:40:49,854 --> 00:40:52,607
What do you think?
It's the perfect place to study.

497
00:40:52,814 --> 00:40:54,167
Even the phone's out of range.

498
00:41:01,734 --> 00:41:02,883
Do you regret it?

499
00:41:03,054 --> 00:41:04,692
And what'll you do here?

500
00:41:05,694 --> 00:41:07,173
We're in this together, right?

501
00:41:08,014 --> 00:41:09,845
And I'll keep Maria under control.

502
00:41:10,494 --> 00:41:12,405
But you need to work.

503
00:41:13,654 --> 00:41:15,485
I told you,
the gym gave me a week.

504
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:17,209
Then we'll see.

505
00:41:17,414 --> 00:41:18,893
Besides, Barcelona's close by.

506
00:41:25,854 --> 00:41:26,764
What's wrong?

507
00:41:27,254 --> 00:41:30,291
I'm all mixed up.
About Carla and about you.

508
00:42:48,694 --> 00:42:51,333
What I don't get is that
you didn't notice he was gay.

509
00:42:51,614 --> 00:42:52,888
Mind you, he isn't camp at all.

510
00:42:53,814 --> 00:42:56,453
We've always been great sexually.

511
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:58,726
And guys can't fake orgasms.

512
00:42:58,934 --> 00:43:01,164
Then it's obvious: He's bisexual.

513
00:43:04,254 --> 00:43:05,767
I really turn him on,

514
00:43:06,174 --> 00:43:08,051
but if he needs to be with a guy

515
00:43:08,414 --> 00:43:09,733
and I'm not a guy...?

516
00:43:09,934 --> 00:43:11,526
Since you're so open,

517
00:43:11,694 --> 00:43:13,491
let him have the occasional fling,

518
00:43:13,894 --> 00:43:14,963
and that's that.

519
00:43:15,454 --> 00:43:16,523
Are you making fun of me?

520
00:43:17,254 --> 00:43:19,404
No, but you say you're so liberal...

521
00:43:19,614 --> 00:43:21,094
and in the end,
you're like everybody,

522
00:43:21,174 --> 00:43:22,527
you can't stand infidelity.

523
00:43:22,734 --> 00:43:23,883
It's not the same thing!

524
00:43:24,094 --> 00:43:26,369
Sleeping around is not the same

525
00:43:26,574 --> 00:43:28,405
as being with the same guy.

526
00:43:29,254 --> 00:43:31,768
So for you, his mistake was
sticking to the same guy.

527
00:43:32,614 --> 00:43:34,047
All this isn't going to fit!

528
00:43:34,254 --> 00:43:36,210
You brought too many clothes.

529
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,093
It's only a few days.

530
00:43:39,654 --> 00:43:41,167
I'm going for a walk.

531
00:43:42,454 --> 00:43:44,126
- I'll come with you.
- No, Rai.

532
00:43:44,294 --> 00:43:45,647
I'd rather be alone.

533
00:43:54,854 --> 00:43:56,854
I think this game
is slipping through your fingers.

534
00:43:56,974 --> 00:43:57,929
What game?

535
00:43:59,494 --> 00:44:02,691
I know you.
It's seduction than turns you on...

536
00:44:03,294 --> 00:44:04,814
and by now
you must be tired of it.

537
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:07,607
- What if I'm not tired of it?
- That's worse.

538
00:44:08,254 --> 00:44:11,132
You're miserable.
I don't recognize you.

539
00:44:11,294 --> 00:44:12,932
I'm the same as ever.

540
00:44:13,974 --> 00:44:15,327
I'm not so sure.

541
00:44:16,414 --> 00:44:18,723
I've never seen you worried
about one of your lovers.

542
00:44:18,894 --> 00:44:21,806
Sure, I only have to worry
about you, right?

543
00:44:49,174 --> 00:44:50,926
I'm sorry, I'm busy!

544
00:44:51,454 --> 00:44:53,172
- What do you want?
- To talk to you.

545
00:44:53,374 --> 00:44:55,490
- Did something happen to Bruno?
- No, relax.

546
00:44:55,974 --> 00:44:57,254
We're with Maria in the country.

547
00:44:58,334 --> 00:45:01,451
- He doesn't know I came to see you.
- I've got nothing to say to you!

548
00:45:07,174 --> 00:45:08,323
I think you do.

549
00:45:15,494 --> 00:45:16,973
Just give me one minute.

550
00:45:18,774 --> 00:45:19,809
Please.

551
00:45:44,134 --> 00:45:45,249
Alright...

552
00:46:09,094 --> 00:46:10,209
Shift your leg.

553
00:46:12,294 --> 00:46:13,249
Does it hurt?

554
00:46:13,934 --> 00:46:14,844
Here?

555
00:46:15,974 --> 00:46:17,123
It starts here.

556
00:46:31,014 --> 00:46:32,163
Leave me alone!

557
00:46:42,374 --> 00:46:43,574
You and Bruno love each other.

558
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:48,289
- Why are you apart?
- What do you care?

559
00:46:48,854 --> 00:46:50,253
Are you bored with him?

560
00:46:51,414 --> 00:46:53,052
If I were, I wouldn't be here.

561
00:46:55,134 --> 00:46:56,374
It hurts me to see him so down.

562
00:46:56,614 --> 00:46:57,729
He misses you.

563
00:47:03,174 --> 00:47:05,244
You're asking me to take him back?

564
00:47:05,454 --> 00:47:06,443
Yes.

565
00:47:06,934 --> 00:47:08,572
And you? Would you disappear?

566
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:11,443
We'd carry on as before.

567
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:14,927
If you hadn't seen us together,

568
00:47:15,614 --> 00:47:17,127
would Bruno have seemed
any different to you?

569
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:18,369
Of course not.

570
00:47:18,694 --> 00:47:20,332
So I'm not taking anything from you.

571
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:24,524
Think about it.

572
00:47:31,574 --> 00:47:32,450
Hi.

573
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:47,364
<i>You and I are free,
I believe in you and me,</i>

574
00:47:47,574 --> 00:47:49,929
<i>Come back...</i>

575
00:48:10,734 --> 00:48:13,009
This isn't healthy, girl.

576
00:48:14,094 --> 00:48:15,607
I'm taking you out tonight,

577
00:48:15,814 --> 00:48:17,691
If I have to drag you by the hair!

578
00:48:27,774 --> 00:48:29,048
I can't take any more.

579
00:48:30,414 --> 00:48:32,882
Four days and not a trace
of that prick.

580
00:48:33,334 --> 00:48:34,084
Forget him.

581
00:48:34,294 --> 00:48:38,082
How? Every step I take
I find something of his.

582
00:48:40,974 --> 00:48:43,534
His tracksuit! His books!

583
00:48:44,694 --> 00:48:47,527
His travel card! His lD card!

584
00:48:48,974 --> 00:48:51,044
It's like he's here but he's not!

585
00:48:51,414 --> 00:48:53,054
He won't come back
or take his stuff away!

586
00:48:55,854 --> 00:48:57,446
I'm going crazy!

587
00:48:57,934 --> 00:49:00,135
If he hasn't come back for it,
he doesn't care about it.

588
00:49:01,014 --> 00:49:02,333
So you shouldn't.

589
00:49:02,694 --> 00:49:04,889
Let's throw all his stuff out!

590
00:49:06,654 --> 00:49:08,929
- Where are the garbage bags?
- Don't go overboard.

591
00:49:09,894 --> 00:49:11,725
How can I do that to him?

592
00:49:36,334 --> 00:49:38,768
There's a new bar with great music.

593
00:49:39,174 --> 00:49:41,688
I know one of the barmen.
He'll stand us a drink.

594
00:49:48,534 --> 00:49:50,286
I don't need Bruno for anything.

595
00:49:50,614 --> 00:49:52,445
The best thing
is a good clean-out.

596
00:49:53,054 --> 00:49:54,726
Get away from negative stuff.

597
00:49:54,894 --> 00:49:57,010
Don't get carried away by feelings.

598
00:50:00,094 --> 00:50:00,970
Taxi!

599
00:50:06,534 --> 00:50:08,729
I'm going home. Sorry.

600
00:50:08,934 --> 00:50:11,528
- Are you sure?
- I feel like a quiet night.

601
00:50:12,494 --> 00:50:15,167
But you have fun. Don't worry.

602
00:50:35,694 --> 00:50:37,654
Have you seen the T-shirt
I wear around the house?

603
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:45,245
Wait up!

604
00:50:45,454 --> 00:50:47,046
I just want to talk to you.

605
00:50:53,814 --> 00:50:54,769
Wait!

606
00:50:57,334 --> 00:50:59,973
Stop! Stop!

607
00:51:02,814 --> 00:51:05,248
Stop, please, stop!

608
00:51:06,414 --> 00:51:08,644
Why didn't you answer my message?

609
00:51:08,814 --> 00:51:11,248
There was no signal.
I only got it two hours ago.

610
00:51:11,454 --> 00:51:14,764
- I thought it was better I came.
- All your stuff's been taken away.

611
00:51:18,934 --> 00:51:20,333
I threw it all out.

612
00:51:21,014 --> 00:51:22,083
No, no, it's fine.

613
00:51:27,294 --> 00:51:28,090
Everything?

614
00:51:28,574 --> 00:51:29,893
Well, not everything.

615
00:52:54,534 --> 00:52:55,330
Very well.

616
00:52:56,254 --> 00:52:57,004
Alright.

617
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,044
'Bye.

618
00:53:01,294 --> 00:53:03,808
It's just your dad,
the meeting's dragging on.

619
00:53:03,974 --> 00:53:05,335
We're not to expect him for lunch.

620
00:53:05,934 --> 00:53:07,413
Did you really think he was coming?

621
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:08,889
Don't start.

622
00:53:11,134 --> 00:53:14,763
By the way, how is it with Bruno
after his little... fling?

623
00:53:15,294 --> 00:53:16,283
Better than ever.

624
00:53:16,574 --> 00:53:18,565
But are you sure
they're not seeing each other?

625
00:53:18,774 --> 00:53:20,526
- I'm sure he is.
- What?!

626
00:53:20,734 --> 00:53:22,611
It's part of our deal as a couple.

627
00:53:23,214 --> 00:53:24,442
We're open people.

628
00:53:24,654 --> 00:53:27,646
So he's still seeing that girl
and you don't mind.

629
00:53:28,094 --> 00:53:30,483
It's not a girl, it's a boy.

630
00:53:34,694 --> 00:53:36,605
And you're fine with that?

631
00:53:36,814 --> 00:53:39,851
What's not fine is my father
has a thing going

632
00:53:40,054 --> 00:53:42,932
with his architect
and you pretend you don't know.

633
00:53:43,134 --> 00:53:45,694
It was a fleeting thing.
It's in the past.

634
00:53:45,894 --> 00:53:47,771
He's been with this woman
for five years.

635
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:49,805
He comes to Barcelona to see her,
that's why he's not here!

636
00:53:50,014 --> 00:53:52,244
- Everyone knows!
- Do you want us to separate?

637
00:53:52,454 --> 00:53:54,570
Hello. First course is...

638
00:53:54,774 --> 00:53:55,934
I want a whisky on the rocks.

639
00:53:56,374 --> 00:53:57,284
Same here.

640
00:53:58,574 --> 00:54:00,405
What, isn't it allowed?

641
00:54:00,934 --> 00:54:02,765
Look at my face, I'm old enough.

642
00:54:10,774 --> 00:54:12,969
I'm old now, but you're young.

643
00:54:13,454 --> 00:54:16,491
Leave Bruno.
There are tons of terrific guys.

644
00:54:16,694 --> 00:54:19,925
Why? I'm happy with him.
I feel good.

645
00:54:20,134 --> 00:54:21,647
I don't believe you.

646
00:54:32,214 --> 00:54:33,647
Where are you off to so early?

647
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:34,764
The gym.

648
00:54:36,294 --> 00:54:38,364
I don't have class till midday.

649
00:54:40,254 --> 00:54:41,892
- Why don't you go later?
- No...

650
00:54:42,094 --> 00:54:43,732
I'd rather go now.

651
00:54:44,654 --> 00:54:46,212
C'mon, don't be a bad girl.

652
00:54:46,814 --> 00:54:47,774
We're going to the pool.

653
00:54:48,574 --> 00:54:50,054
- I'll go get my stuff.
- No, Carla...

654
00:54:52,214 --> 00:54:53,966
- I've got a karate class.
- With Rai?

655
00:54:54,174 --> 00:54:55,892
Sure. He's the teacher.

656
00:54:56,574 --> 00:54:59,088
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I thought you'd get mad.

657
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:01,290
Whatever I do, you get mad.

658
00:55:03,094 --> 00:55:04,573
What are you doing tonight?

659
00:55:05,334 --> 00:55:06,403
Any plans?

660
00:55:06,614 --> 00:55:08,047
I don't know.

661
00:55:08,254 --> 00:55:10,294
I just got up and you ask me
what I'm doing tonight!

662
00:55:10,814 --> 00:55:12,293
In case you were staying with Rai.

663
00:55:12,494 --> 00:55:13,927
If I were, I'd call to tell you.

664
00:55:14,134 --> 00:55:16,648
I don't spend every night with him!
This is crazy!

665
00:55:16,854 --> 00:55:18,014
It's just to organize myself!

666
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:20,125
I might meet Marta
after the magazine closes up.

667
00:55:20,294 --> 00:55:21,727
Do what you want!

668
00:55:21,974 --> 00:55:23,734
Stop fucking hovering
around me all the time!

669
00:55:29,134 --> 00:55:31,364
Shit. I'm sorry.

670
00:55:32,774 --> 00:55:34,412
C'mon, c'mon...

671
00:55:36,614 --> 00:55:39,526
We're so tied together,
we've become too dependent.

672
00:55:39,734 --> 00:55:40,928
That's not good.

673
00:55:42,574 --> 00:55:44,053
I need you.

674
00:55:44,694 --> 00:55:45,888
I don't need you.

675
00:55:46,094 --> 00:55:48,934
- I'm with you because I want to be.
- You didn't talk like that before.

676
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:53,052
'Cause I'd never thought about it.

677
00:55:54,614 --> 00:55:56,172
I feel the same way about you.

678
00:55:57,374 --> 00:55:58,727
No, no...

679
00:55:59,534 --> 00:56:00,523
It's much stronger.

680
00:56:01,214 --> 00:56:02,533
I love you even more.

681
00:56:03,734 --> 00:56:05,690
Because you try to
accept me the way I am.

682
00:56:06,494 --> 00:56:07,563
It's not easy.

683
00:56:28,574 --> 00:56:30,804
I'll be back tonight.
If you're not meeting anyone

684
00:56:31,014 --> 00:56:32,606
after work, I'll be here.

685
00:56:33,174 --> 00:56:33,731
'Bye.

686
00:56:43,254 --> 00:56:44,846
We're been waiting an hour!
What if we just go?

687
00:56:45,054 --> 00:56:45,884
No way.

688
00:56:46,214 --> 00:56:48,967
Maybe you think it's easy
to get time with Virginia Dalmau.

689
00:56:49,254 --> 00:56:51,051
I'm losing the urge to apologize.

690
00:56:51,254 --> 00:56:52,575
Do you want the magazine to fold?

691
00:56:53,174 --> 00:56:54,448
You'll kneel if you have to!

692
00:56:54,654 --> 00:56:55,494
What do I say to her?

693
00:56:56,334 --> 00:56:57,926
The truth. What happened.

694
00:56:58,334 --> 00:57:00,052
Sure, the shower thing?

695
00:57:00,214 --> 00:57:01,295
I'm sure she'll understand.

696
00:57:02,094 --> 00:57:04,847
But don't tell her you let them
shower together now,

697
00:57:05,014 --> 00:57:06,811
or she'll laugh her head off.

698
00:57:09,854 --> 00:57:13,210
If you love someone,
you don't inhibit or shackle them.

699
00:57:13,694 --> 00:57:15,889
Besides, if he's seeing Rai,
Bruno tells me.

700
00:57:16,134 --> 00:57:19,012
Deep down you're like your mother:
Resigned to it.

701
00:57:19,334 --> 00:57:21,290
I accept this situation
because I want to!

702
00:57:21,494 --> 00:57:22,210
I'm free!

703
00:57:22,414 --> 00:57:25,292
My father ignores my mother.
And me!

704
00:57:25,494 --> 00:57:27,610
Bruno doesn't ignore me.
He loves me!

705
00:57:27,814 --> 00:57:30,282
Why wouldn't he?
With all this understanding?

706
00:57:32,454 --> 00:57:33,569
You know what I think?

707
00:57:33,814 --> 00:57:35,850
When someone's that open,
they're not in love.

708
00:57:36,054 --> 00:57:38,522
But it's comfortable to have
company, sex...

709
00:57:38,734 --> 00:57:40,531
- I'm fine with it.
- Yes, you are...

710
00:57:40,734 --> 00:57:41,803
and he is even more.

711
00:57:42,494 --> 00:57:43,454
But you don't look fine.

712
00:57:43,534 --> 00:57:45,365
If you want to kid yourself,
It's up to you.

713
00:57:45,574 --> 00:57:48,407
You're kidding yourself with this
I-don't-want-a-partner stuff,

714
00:57:48,614 --> 00:57:50,764
and the fact is you can't get one!

715
00:57:50,974 --> 00:57:51,645
What's that?

716
00:57:51,854 --> 00:57:53,731
You act all slutty
because you refuse to admit

717
00:57:53,894 --> 00:57:55,805
that you're desperately
looking for someone!

718
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:58,733
And you end up shagging Adrian,
who you think is an idiot!

719
00:58:06,214 --> 00:58:07,852
A bit over the top, aren't you?

720
00:58:53,894 --> 00:58:55,771
Thanks for coming.

721
00:58:59,774 --> 00:59:01,492
I'm so sorry for what I said.

722
00:59:02,454 --> 00:59:04,604
It may be true,
but you're very cruel, girl.

723
00:59:05,134 --> 00:59:06,806
I've got feelings too, you know?

724
00:59:07,814 --> 00:59:08,485
Forgive me.

725
00:59:08,694 --> 00:59:10,889
I'm not a wall you throws rocks at
and they bounce off.

726
00:59:12,774 --> 00:59:14,534
I feel terrible
and I'm taking it out on you.

727
00:59:15,054 --> 00:59:17,124
I've got problems too,
but I solve them on my own

728
00:59:17,334 --> 00:59:18,733
and I don't blame anyone.

729
00:59:27,574 --> 00:59:30,486
You're so sensitive,
I can't say anything to you.

730
00:59:33,374 --> 00:59:36,047
You can sleep at my place,

731
00:59:36,294 --> 00:59:38,171
but as you know,
it's a family environment.

732
00:59:42,694 --> 00:59:43,683
You know what?

733
00:59:45,054 --> 00:59:47,614
We're got a photo
and interview session with Virginia.

734
00:59:47,974 --> 00:59:49,885
What? Fucking brilliant!

735
00:59:51,494 --> 00:59:53,564
Lighten up, girl.
Dani and Adrian are coming.

736
00:59:53,774 --> 00:59:55,173
Wait till we tell them!

737
00:59:56,814 --> 00:59:58,213
Why'd you ask them to come?

738
00:59:58,414 --> 01:00:00,132
We were already meeting up.

739
01:00:01,094 --> 01:00:02,573
I had to let off steam with someone.

740
01:00:04,374 --> 01:00:05,443
What did you tell them?

741
01:00:05,654 --> 01:00:07,849
They knew Bruno and Rai
were still together.

742
01:00:08,414 --> 01:00:12,373
Dani saw them and...
I explained the situation.

743
01:00:12,894 --> 01:00:15,454
I'm going to the bathroom,
my stomach's upset.

744
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:19,452
If you'd only seen it...

745
01:00:20,254 --> 01:00:21,892
They looked so happy...

746
01:00:23,294 --> 01:00:24,932
When you left me there...

747
01:00:29,174 --> 01:00:30,493
I swear to you...

748
01:00:50,854 --> 01:00:51,809
Where have you been?

749
01:00:52,734 --> 01:00:53,530
Around.

750
01:00:55,934 --> 01:00:59,006
- Who were you with?
- You're asking me for explanations?

751
01:01:00,614 --> 01:01:02,775
No, no. You always tell me,
but if you don't want to...

752
01:01:13,534 --> 01:01:16,651
I was with someone who suggested
I sleep at their place.

753
01:01:20,814 --> 01:01:21,883
But I didn't want to.

754
01:01:24,894 --> 01:01:27,010
Because you didn't fancy them?

755
01:01:35,254 --> 01:01:36,369
Hello, Marta.

756
01:01:39,414 --> 01:01:41,052
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

757
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:42,842
She's right here.

758
01:01:43,534 --> 01:01:45,968
You left your bag
and camera... in the bar.

759
01:01:54,134 --> 01:01:55,362
Yes, don't worry.

760
01:01:55,814 --> 01:01:57,611
I didn't feel like talking.

761
01:01:59,694 --> 01:02:01,525
See you tomorrow. Big kiss.

762
01:02:13,574 --> 01:02:15,246
I'm pathetic, aren't I?

763
01:02:18,654 --> 01:02:22,169
Sometimes I get the feeling
everyone's laughing at me.

764
01:02:23,054 --> 01:02:24,328
Especially you.

765
01:02:33,934 --> 01:02:35,333
You're not pathetic.

766
01:02:37,174 --> 01:02:39,244
You're the most
wonderful person I know.

767
01:02:40,694 --> 01:02:42,605
And I'm so lucky you're with me.

768
01:02:45,374 --> 01:02:46,602
Do you really think so?

769
01:03:12,974 --> 01:03:14,532
What are those shelves?

770
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:17,934
Surprise! Didn't you need some?

771
01:03:18,174 --> 01:03:19,493
Where'd you get them from?

772
01:03:20,294 --> 01:03:22,364
The gym,
they were throwing them out.

773
01:03:25,934 --> 01:03:26,684
I don't want them.

774
01:03:28,254 --> 01:03:30,006
Nor do I want Rai coming here.

775
01:03:30,934 --> 01:03:32,049
This is our place,

776
01:03:32,614 --> 01:03:33,933
my parents' place!

777
01:03:44,574 --> 01:03:46,212
- It was a real pleasure.
- Thank you.

778
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:48,529
Yeah.

779
01:03:50,254 --> 01:03:53,530
At first I was a bit intimidated,
but in the end we connected.

780
01:03:53,774 --> 01:03:55,287
I'm so happy.

781
01:03:57,814 --> 01:03:59,691
Thanks, Mum.

782
01:04:01,134 --> 01:04:03,011
I'm going. Big kiss.

783
01:04:05,134 --> 01:04:06,094
What are you doing here?

784
01:04:06,174 --> 01:04:07,163
I came to apologize,

785
01:04:08,014 --> 01:04:09,974
for being at your place
when you weren't there...

786
01:04:10,494 --> 01:04:11,374
to put up the shelves.

787
01:04:11,494 --> 01:04:14,770
We're not here to discuss our lives,
we're working.

788
01:04:15,094 --> 01:04:17,289
Sorry, They said you'd finished.

789
01:04:19,014 --> 01:04:20,493
Can I help in any way?

790
01:04:21,654 --> 01:04:23,690
You've got a volunteer
to help tidy up.

791
01:04:24,094 --> 01:04:25,243
See you tomorrow.

792
01:04:38,614 --> 01:04:39,251
See you.

793
01:04:39,454 --> 01:04:41,092
Why do you tell him
what we talk about?

794
01:04:41,574 --> 01:04:43,565
I only told him you got mad
about the shelves

795
01:04:43,774 --> 01:04:45,054
and didn't want him
to come here.

796
01:04:45,254 --> 01:04:47,290
- What else?
- Nothing.

797
01:04:47,494 --> 01:04:49,849
It's hard not to talk about you.
I live here, with you.

798
01:04:50,254 --> 01:04:52,290
I don't want you talking
about me again, alright?

799
01:04:52,454 --> 01:04:54,172
Fine, as you wish.

800
01:05:04,174 --> 01:05:05,812
I think this is yours.

801
01:05:07,134 --> 01:05:08,203
Thanks.

802
01:05:09,454 --> 01:05:10,489
May I?

803
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:17,284
Bruno!

804
01:05:18,654 --> 01:05:19,534
How are you, handsome?

805
01:05:19,934 --> 01:05:21,128
What are you doing here?

806
01:05:22,614 --> 01:05:24,252
I came to take you both to lunch.

807
01:05:28,334 --> 01:05:29,050
I'm buying.

808
01:05:29,254 --> 01:05:31,006
I'd rather study some more.

809
01:05:31,614 --> 01:05:32,763
Then we'll wait.

810
01:05:33,774 --> 01:05:34,684
It's early.

811
01:05:38,454 --> 01:05:40,410
We should forget lunch?

812
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:45,729
Shall you and I go?

813
01:05:47,334 --> 01:05:48,050
What?

814
01:05:48,814 --> 01:05:50,770
If Bruno wants to study,
let him study.

815
01:05:54,494 --> 01:05:55,813
Tell him to go away.

816
01:06:01,014 --> 01:06:02,367
She doesn't feel like it either.

817
01:06:02,534 --> 01:06:03,091
Right?

818
01:06:04,334 --> 01:06:05,084
Yes.

819
01:06:06,254 --> 01:06:07,482
I do feel like it.

820
01:06:07,694 --> 01:06:08,365
Shall we go?

821
01:06:08,974 --> 01:06:10,123
Then let's go.

822
01:06:10,654 --> 01:06:12,724
No, you stay here and study.

823
01:06:21,974 --> 01:06:24,932
Don't think for one moment
we're going to be friends, okay?

824
01:06:25,774 --> 01:06:29,608
I'm just doing it to annoy Bruno
and to set some things straight.

825
01:06:29,814 --> 01:06:32,089
Fine. I'll get the food.

826
01:06:32,774 --> 01:06:33,843
I said I was buying.

827
01:06:34,814 --> 01:06:37,567
- Hi.
- How are you?

828
01:06:37,774 --> 01:06:39,810
- Where's Pau?
- Doing exams.

829
01:06:47,894 --> 01:06:48,690
Hello.

830
01:06:58,454 --> 01:07:01,844
You must be used to this stuff,
but I don't like it at all.

831
01:07:03,094 --> 01:07:05,528
You'll love it.
It's all delicious here.

832
01:07:22,534 --> 01:07:23,489
Let's go.

833
01:07:27,374 --> 01:07:29,012
- See you.
- See you.

834
01:07:41,054 --> 01:07:43,773
Hey! Hey! You forgot something.

835
01:07:45,294 --> 01:07:46,773
Yes, to pay...

836
01:07:46,974 --> 01:07:47,963
No, not that.

837
01:07:50,494 --> 01:07:51,813
She thinks I'm shoplifting.

838
01:07:52,414 --> 01:07:53,449
Tell her I'm a good guy.

839
01:07:54,694 --> 01:07:55,888
You're giving this to us?

840
01:07:56,414 --> 01:07:58,370
On the condition
that you eat it today.

841
01:07:58,854 --> 01:07:59,730
Why?

842
01:08:00,094 --> 01:08:01,288
Because it expires tomorrow.

843
01:08:02,214 --> 01:08:04,055
Or do you think these people
like losing money?

844
01:08:04,854 --> 01:08:05,764
You bastard.

845
01:08:05,974 --> 01:08:07,335
I might not let you have anything.

846
01:08:10,894 --> 01:08:13,613
- You know him?
- I'm karate teacher to his son.

847
01:08:15,334 --> 01:08:17,211
And everything we took
expires tomorrow.

848
01:08:17,414 --> 01:08:19,609
Jackpot! You've won...

849
01:08:20,094 --> 01:08:21,447
a jar of foie-gras.

850
01:08:25,374 --> 01:08:27,054
Are you going to tell me
where we're going?

851
01:08:27,894 --> 01:08:28,724
That's them.

852
01:08:38,134 --> 01:08:40,090
Look at him, the missing piece.

853
01:08:49,814 --> 01:08:50,849
C'mon, Rai!

854
01:08:52,694 --> 01:08:53,729
This is Carla.

855
01:09:08,094 --> 01:09:10,289
- Go, Rai!
- Go for it!

856
01:09:43,254 --> 01:09:46,087
It's a bit risky, isn't it?
You could kill yourself.

857
01:09:50,014 --> 01:09:52,369
If you don't take risks in life,
you're already dead.

858
01:09:52,814 --> 01:09:53,929
How about that food?

859
01:09:55,854 --> 01:09:57,492
- Ham?
- Yeah.

860
01:09:58,174 --> 01:09:59,732
How did you get into dancing?

861
01:10:00,494 --> 01:10:03,645
As kids we'd meet here
and imitate videos we saw on TV.

862
01:10:04,454 --> 01:10:06,012
I used to imitate Madonna.

863
01:10:08,814 --> 01:10:10,691
- Did you live here?
- I'm from Galicia.

864
01:10:11,414 --> 01:10:13,803
But when I was 11 my dad died,

865
01:10:14,334 --> 01:10:16,006
so my mum and I came to Barcelona.

866
01:10:19,054 --> 01:10:20,254
So this is your neighbourhood?

867
01:10:20,414 --> 01:10:22,530
Well, it's the place where
I spent the most time.

868
01:10:23,214 --> 01:10:25,569
- We left here later.
- Where to?

869
01:10:26,134 --> 01:10:27,487
Back to Vigo for a while,

870
01:10:28,294 --> 01:10:31,411
we were in Hendaya, Santander,
wherever she got work.

871
01:10:31,774 --> 01:10:33,366
Where's your mother?

872
01:10:34,094 --> 01:10:36,130
She lives in Cadiz
with her new boyfriend.

873
01:10:39,294 --> 01:10:42,525
When I come here and see
my old friends, I feel good.

874
01:10:44,854 --> 01:10:48,005
Your breakdancing is great.
If you wanted to...

875
01:10:48,254 --> 01:10:49,892
Breakdancers live to dance.

876
01:10:50,694 --> 01:10:52,332
I can't get into just one thing.

877
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:54,523
Just in case I fail.

878
01:10:57,014 --> 01:10:58,572
I'd rather nibble everything.

879
01:11:18,374 --> 01:11:20,729
At boarding school
I got involved with a guy.

880
01:11:21,534 --> 01:11:23,294
But when I was outside,
I'd score with girls.

881
01:11:23,574 --> 01:11:26,964
Did you feel homosexual
or heterosexual?

882
01:11:27,654 --> 01:11:30,566
I didn't sweat about it.
It was all sexual.

883
01:11:32,334 --> 01:11:33,733
It seemed normal to you.

884
01:11:34,214 --> 01:11:35,090
Normal?

885
01:11:37,934 --> 01:11:38,730
Yeah.

886
01:11:39,454 --> 01:11:41,092
Until I got beaten up.

887
01:11:42,094 --> 01:11:43,243
I was 16.

888
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:46,613
And you signed up for karate.

889
01:11:53,094 --> 01:11:54,732
I like reaching the limit
of my energy,

890
01:11:55,214 --> 01:11:58,445
until I can't move a finger
or think about anything.

891
01:11:59,014 --> 01:12:00,686
It's a kind of sweet death.

892
01:12:01,414 --> 01:12:03,255
Hasn't anything like that
ever happened to you?

893
01:12:04,334 --> 01:12:05,289
Yes.

894
01:12:05,774 --> 01:12:07,765
But I was totally high.

895
01:12:08,534 --> 01:12:10,013
The high is always here.

896
01:12:12,654 --> 01:12:14,690
With some people
it's easier to find.

897
01:12:19,934 --> 01:12:21,731
Thanks for walking me home.

898
01:12:21,974 --> 01:12:22,884
You're welcome.

899
01:12:28,174 --> 01:12:29,084
Hey!

900
01:12:30,774 --> 01:12:34,244
Now we're set things straight,
don't think we're going to be friends.

901
01:12:35,374 --> 01:12:37,012
It was just to annoy Bruno.

902
01:13:00,494 --> 01:13:02,086
You're angry.

903
01:13:02,454 --> 01:13:03,728
No, I'm studying.

904
01:13:05,654 --> 01:13:07,007
What are laughing at?

905
01:13:07,574 --> 01:13:08,643
Nothing.

906
01:13:16,494 --> 01:13:18,007
Did you have a good time?

907
01:13:20,694 --> 01:13:21,763
Do you forgive me?

908
01:13:23,574 --> 01:13:25,530
When you're angry
you get really aggressive.

909
01:13:32,214 --> 01:13:33,283
What did you do?

910
01:13:34,174 --> 01:13:36,927
Do I ask you what you do
when you're with him?

911
01:13:51,814 --> 01:13:53,088
They're letting me crash here

912
01:13:53,614 --> 01:13:55,094
in exchange for
doing the maintenance.

913
01:13:56,134 --> 01:13:57,010
Come right in.

914
01:15:33,733 --> 01:15:35,564
It's pathetic,

915
01:15:35,853 --> 01:15:37,650
She acts all super-sexy,
at her age.

916
01:15:37,853 --> 01:15:40,003
That was intense,
Rai turning up all of a sudden.

917
01:15:40,213 --> 01:15:42,249
He and Carla are good friends now.

918
01:15:42,453 --> 01:15:43,363
What's that?

919
01:15:49,773 --> 01:15:51,809
Have you chosen the photos
we're going to send?

920
01:15:53,093 --> 01:15:55,527
You decide, I don't mind.

921
01:16:01,853 --> 01:16:02,683
What's all this?

922
01:16:03,733 --> 01:16:04,324
What?

923
01:16:07,213 --> 01:16:10,285
- Are you officially on together?
- We have been for ten days.

924
01:16:10,533 --> 01:16:11,886
Why didn't you tell me?

925
01:16:12,093 --> 01:16:14,243
'Cause you've been busy lately.

926
01:16:14,453 --> 01:16:17,570
You prefer your boyfriend's lover
to your best friend now.

927
01:16:31,493 --> 01:16:34,246
Bruno has no idea how I feel.

928
01:16:37,253 --> 01:16:41,007
I doubt he'd be so understanding
in my place.

929
01:16:41,733 --> 01:16:43,451
- Run the test on him.
- What test?

930
01:16:44,453 --> 01:16:45,772
What do I do?

931
01:16:47,093 --> 01:16:48,412
Find a lover?

932
01:16:49,973 --> 01:16:51,691
You must fancy someone.

933
01:17:09,973 --> 01:17:10,883
We're closed.

934
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:13,204
- Hi.
- Hi.

935
01:17:14,853 --> 01:17:17,970
It suddenly occurred to me
to come and see you,

936
01:17:18,373 --> 01:17:20,409
but if you're heading out, I'll go.

937
01:17:20,613 --> 01:17:22,683
No, I'm just tidying up.

938
01:17:27,853 --> 01:17:29,923
- Come in.
- Okay.

939
01:17:50,573 --> 01:17:52,211
I'm in your bedroom.

940
01:17:54,013 --> 01:17:55,492
I was going to lie down and read.

941
01:17:57,533 --> 01:17:59,012
Will you help me make the bed?

942
01:18:01,213 --> 01:18:02,089
Okay.

943
01:18:34,973 --> 01:18:36,088
Sit down.

944
01:18:40,693 --> 01:18:43,002
This must be great for your back.

945
01:18:48,413 --> 01:18:52,247
Do you ever get a fright at night
from your own reflection?

946
01:18:53,453 --> 01:18:54,522
It's got its pluses.

947
01:18:56,453 --> 01:19:00,571
It's as if someone just like you
is here, but it's not you...

948
01:19:01,453 --> 01:19:03,284
and you can spy on what he does.

949
01:20:11,853 --> 01:20:12,808
Hello!

950
01:20:16,453 --> 01:20:18,569
I'm having dinner.
Since you were so late...

951
01:20:20,293 --> 01:20:22,124
Did you meet for drinks?

952
01:20:23,213 --> 01:20:24,168
No.

953
01:20:24,893 --> 01:20:26,292
Were you working late?

954
01:20:26,693 --> 01:20:28,729
Working, no... shagging.

955
01:20:30,813 --> 01:20:31,848
With whom?

956
01:20:36,813 --> 01:20:38,087
Who else?

957
01:20:46,253 --> 01:20:47,925
No, just kidding.

958
01:20:51,733 --> 01:20:53,132
I'm going to bed.

959
01:20:55,213 --> 01:20:56,692
There's steak in the fridge.

960
01:21:27,533 --> 01:21:29,364
- Who is it?
- Maria.

961
01:21:35,413 --> 01:21:38,211
Carla. We're at the pool.

962
01:21:39,813 --> 01:21:41,166
No, I haven't told him.

963
01:21:42,573 --> 01:21:43,722
It's hard for me too.

964
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:49,292
Yes, I know.
I know we have to tell him.

965
01:21:51,813 --> 01:21:52,689
Okay.

966
01:21:54,933 --> 01:21:57,970
I'll call you. Big kiss.

967
01:22:00,813 --> 01:22:03,407
How about that Virginia,
after all that complaining...

968
01:22:04,013 --> 01:22:04,809
Give me some.

969
01:22:05,173 --> 01:22:06,774
- Here, Carla.
- What are we celebrating?

970
01:22:06,973 --> 01:22:09,533
They're buying us!
And they love the photos!

971
01:22:09,733 --> 01:22:11,530
We're meeting bosses of
the distributor this afternoon

972
01:22:11,733 --> 01:22:12,688
to sign the deal!

973
01:22:12,893 --> 01:22:13,450
That's great.

974
01:22:18,893 --> 01:22:19,803
Something wrong?

975
01:22:19,973 --> 01:22:21,122
No. Why?

976
01:22:22,493 --> 01:22:25,166
We've dreamt of this
for a long time,

977
01:22:25,533 --> 01:22:27,524
and now we've done it.
How about some enthusiasm?

978
01:22:28,333 --> 01:22:30,164
I'm happy, really.

979
01:22:31,413 --> 01:22:32,402
It's great.

980
01:22:39,453 --> 01:22:40,522
I'm going to the bathroom.

981
01:22:50,733 --> 01:22:52,086
What's wrong?

982
01:22:52,293 --> 01:22:54,761
- You've been weird for days.
- I'm involved with Rai.

983
01:22:55,253 --> 01:22:56,049
What?!

984
01:22:56,253 --> 01:22:57,242
I'm involved with Rai.

985
01:22:57,453 --> 01:22:59,045
How did Bruno take it?

986
01:22:59,253 --> 01:23:00,686
I don't dare tell him.

987
01:23:00,893 --> 01:23:03,088
But are you still in love
with Bruno or not?

988
01:23:03,293 --> 01:23:05,761
Yes, I'm in love with Bruno,

989
01:23:06,093 --> 01:23:08,004
but Rai gets me so hot!

990
01:23:11,373 --> 01:23:12,852
What does Rai say about it?

991
01:23:13,893 --> 01:23:15,963
We've decided not to
see each other for now.

992
01:23:16,413 --> 01:23:19,405
- You have to tell Bruno.
- I'm afraid he'll leave me.

993
01:23:19,733 --> 01:23:22,327
If he really loves you
he'll accept it, like you did.

994
01:23:22,533 --> 01:23:24,922
- And if he doesn't?
- Then he's not worth it.

995
01:23:30,133 --> 01:23:32,044
Yeah, I'm involved with Rai!
So what?!

996
01:23:33,533 --> 01:23:36,286
Rai, I'm starting to worry.
Why won't you pick up?

997
01:23:36,493 --> 01:23:38,131
They found out at the magazine.

998
01:23:38,853 --> 01:23:40,286
- Can I come in?
- Yes!

999
01:23:46,013 --> 01:23:47,814
Do you want to go to the movies
or for a walk?

1000
01:23:47,893 --> 01:23:51,488
Marta called,
I have to rush to the magazine.

1001
01:23:51,733 --> 01:23:53,530
You're always out late
or busy at night.

1002
01:23:53,733 --> 01:23:54,414
They exploit you.

1003
01:23:54,573 --> 01:23:55,642
Yeah, but it's worth it.

1004
01:23:56,373 --> 01:23:57,328
I've got to run.

1005
01:24:05,453 --> 01:24:06,806
- 'Bye.
- 'Bye.

1006
01:24:12,413 --> 01:24:13,892
Stop, stop, stop.

1007
01:24:21,653 --> 01:24:23,014
Weren't you going to the magazine?

1008
01:24:24,533 --> 01:24:28,526
Yes, but I realized I left my folder
and photos here the other night,

1009
01:24:28,733 --> 01:24:30,291
and I need them.

1010
01:24:30,613 --> 01:24:31,250
What about you?

1011
01:24:31,413 --> 01:24:33,927
You get in so late these days,
I thought I'd visit Rai,

1012
01:24:34,133 --> 01:24:35,646
though he's been busy lately too.

1013
01:24:38,213 --> 01:24:38,850
Shall we go?

1014
01:24:39,613 --> 01:24:40,728
Let's go, yeah.

1015
01:24:42,733 --> 01:24:43,529
Yes?

1016
01:24:44,933 --> 01:24:47,367
- Hello.
- Hello.

1017
01:24:48,813 --> 01:24:51,407
Bruno and I met
at the door by chance.

1018
01:24:52,053 --> 01:24:53,532
I was coming for some photos.

1019
01:24:54,773 --> 01:24:56,206
- Do you want a drink?
- No.

1020
01:24:57,013 --> 01:24:57,968
I'll be right back.

1021
01:24:58,213 --> 01:25:00,408
- I'll go with you.
- Me too.

1022
01:25:11,853 --> 01:25:13,081
Going somewhere?

1023
01:25:13,573 --> 01:25:15,131
I'm going to the country
for a while with Maria.

1024
01:25:15,453 --> 01:25:17,333
- Did something happen to her?
- No, she's fine.

1025
01:25:17,733 --> 01:25:19,530
I'm the one who
needs to get away.

1026
01:25:23,893 --> 01:25:25,212
I'm having a drink.

1027
01:25:26,613 --> 01:25:28,365
- I'll help you.
- No, I'll help him.

1028
01:25:34,733 --> 01:25:37,167
Rai, what's up?
Why are you leaving?

1029
01:25:37,373 --> 01:25:38,333
You can't do this to me.

1030
01:25:38,493 --> 01:25:39,721
Can I get the lemon?

1031
01:25:40,133 --> 01:25:41,452
Then I'll stay with you tonight.

1032
01:25:41,653 --> 01:25:43,211
I'll have a drink too.

1033
01:25:43,493 --> 01:25:45,165
Weren't you going?

1034
01:25:45,413 --> 01:25:47,768
If Rai's leaving,
we have to give him a send-off.

1035
01:25:47,973 --> 01:25:50,965
There's a bottle of gin.
Can you get it?

1036
01:25:55,813 --> 01:25:56,928
You can't go!

1037
01:25:57,333 --> 01:25:58,891
Bruno will be down at any moment.

1038
01:25:59,213 --> 01:26:00,893
Why not ask him to go out
and buy something

1039
01:26:00,973 --> 01:26:03,168
so you can tell me why
you're going without a goodbye?

1040
01:26:05,893 --> 01:26:08,282
- Carla, please.
- You're making a detergent cocktail!

1041
01:26:08,493 --> 01:26:09,892
I don't know what I'm doing!

1042
01:26:10,853 --> 01:26:11,842
Rum!

1043
01:26:15,773 --> 01:26:17,286
There's no gin left.

1044
01:26:17,813 --> 01:26:20,008
- What's wrong?
- I'm hot.

1045
01:26:20,333 --> 01:26:22,528
I've been training,
I need some air.

1046
01:26:23,013 --> 01:26:24,162
You haven't got a fever?

1047
01:26:26,853 --> 01:26:28,332
Let me past!

1048
01:26:30,733 --> 01:26:33,293
A "mojito" would be great.
Will you make it?

1049
01:26:40,613 --> 01:26:43,571
This can't go on, Carla.
I don't want to deceive anyone.

1050
01:26:43,773 --> 01:26:44,967
Neither do I.

1051
01:26:45,693 --> 01:26:47,172
Let's tell him,
It's the best thing.

1052
01:26:47,373 --> 01:26:48,974
- The best thing is for me to go.
- No...

1053
01:26:52,973 --> 01:26:55,043
Here's the Mojito King with...

1054
01:27:15,013 --> 01:27:17,004
Just listen to me!

1055
01:27:22,693 --> 01:27:24,331
Open up. Please.

1056
01:27:26,293 --> 01:27:28,602
I wanted you to feel what I felt.

1057
01:27:29,893 --> 01:27:31,849
For you to know
how much it hurts.

1058
01:27:33,493 --> 01:27:35,563
But I fell for Rai.

1059
01:27:39,613 --> 01:27:41,490
Isn't that what happened to you?

1060
01:27:42,293 --> 01:27:44,602
It doesn't change
the way I feel about you.

1061
01:27:45,013 --> 01:27:46,128
I love you,

1062
01:27:48,053 --> 01:27:50,965
and the main thing
is that we're all together.

1063
01:27:51,333 --> 01:27:52,891
Open up, Please.

1064
01:28:25,493 --> 01:28:26,767
Goodbye, Bruno.

1065
01:29:17,733 --> 01:29:18,882
It's great to see you.

1066
01:29:23,613 --> 01:29:25,569
- Hello.
- Hello.

1067
01:29:26,653 --> 01:29:27,642
Come in.

1068
01:30:30,293 --> 01:30:32,249
You've got a little surprise.

1069
01:31:00,813 --> 01:31:02,087
Can we talk?

1070
01:31:16,013 --> 01:31:16,843
Forgive me.

1071
01:31:17,893 --> 01:31:19,167
I've been a fool.

1072
01:31:19,933 --> 01:31:22,242
I don't know if it was
selfishness or stupidity.

1073
01:31:24,653 --> 01:31:26,086
I feel so ashamed.

1074
01:31:27,293 --> 01:31:29,045
After you and Rai...

1075
01:31:29,733 --> 01:31:31,405
And I wanted you to be friends.

1076
01:31:31,613 --> 01:31:35,003
But we're more than friends,
you saw that.

1077
01:31:35,293 --> 01:31:36,573
Do you still want to be with me?

1078
01:31:37,893 --> 01:31:38,689
More than ever.

1079
01:31:41,253 --> 01:31:43,926
But I don't want Rai to vanish
from my life either.

1080
01:31:44,813 --> 01:31:47,202
- He's important too.
- And to me.

1081
01:31:48,893 --> 01:31:50,929
I never want us to part.

1082
01:32:13,013 --> 01:32:15,288
Things are getting
more complicated than usual.

1083
01:32:16,773 --> 01:32:17,888
What do you mean?

1084
01:32:19,373 --> 01:32:21,887
You can't resist the temtation
to seduce everyone.

1085
01:32:23,133 --> 01:32:26,808
And now the ultimate challenge:
A couple.

1086
01:32:27,133 --> 01:32:28,122
You're jealous.

1087
01:32:29,373 --> 01:32:31,523
I love you,
but I'm not in love with you.

1088
01:32:31,733 --> 01:32:32,688
Right.

1089
01:32:34,333 --> 01:32:35,448
And Bruno?

1090
01:32:36,533 --> 01:32:37,522
Carla?

1091
01:32:39,013 --> 01:32:39,729
Who?

1092
01:32:40,973 --> 01:32:42,008
Both of them.

1093
01:32:43,973 --> 01:32:45,008
I love them.

1094
01:32:47,053 --> 01:32:49,123
Enough to get out of the way
and leave them alone.

1095
01:32:49,333 --> 01:32:51,210
Every time you get
too hooked on somebody,

1096
01:32:51,853 --> 01:32:54,287
you travel, take a lover...

1097
01:32:55,333 --> 01:32:55,970
and run away.

1098
01:32:56,173 --> 01:32:57,526
The only one running away
from it all is you.

1099
01:32:57,733 --> 01:32:59,166
Stop fooling yourself, Rai.

1100
01:32:59,373 --> 01:33:03,161
You're afraid of suffering,
so you're scared of commitment.

1101
01:33:04,173 --> 01:33:07,449
And even more so
when it's not one... but two.

1102
01:33:13,293 --> 01:33:14,931
Have I told you
how beautiful are you?

1103
01:33:16,853 --> 01:33:18,525
I love your body.

1104
01:33:18,733 --> 01:33:20,166
I'll never get tired of it.

1105
01:33:29,773 --> 01:33:31,411
- Where's Rai?
- He's gone.

1106
01:33:31,973 --> 01:33:32,962
To Barcelona.

1107
01:33:34,213 --> 01:33:36,363
I just left him on the road
thumbing a lift.

1108
01:33:58,973 --> 01:34:01,123
- To Barcelona?
- Sure. Get in.

1109
01:34:01,893 --> 01:34:02,962
Look, he's there!

1110
01:34:03,173 --> 01:34:04,492
- Rai!
- Rai!

1111
01:34:04,693 --> 01:34:05,728
Wait!

1112
01:34:08,613 --> 01:34:09,648
Rai!

1113
01:34:15,813 --> 01:34:16,848
Rai!

1114
01:34:17,453 --> 01:34:18,488
Wait!

1115
01:34:19,413 --> 01:34:21,847
Why'd you go without a goodbye?

1116
01:34:22,053 --> 01:34:23,566
I don't like goodbyes.

1117
01:34:23,733 --> 01:34:25,644
Get out, come to lunch! Please!

1118
01:34:25,853 --> 01:34:27,969
Life alone isn't easy,
with two it's complicated,

1119
01:34:28,173 --> 01:34:29,447
and with three, impossible!

1120
01:34:29,773 --> 01:34:31,206
- What?!
- I'll miss you both.

1121
01:34:31,373 --> 01:34:33,250
- What?!
- I'll never forget you!

1122
01:34:33,653 --> 01:34:35,928
- Rai, stay with us!
- Goodbye.

1123
01:34:39,613 --> 01:34:41,968
If you don't take a risk,
you're dead!

1124
01:34:58,173 --> 01:34:59,208
- Stop.
- What?

1125
01:34:59,413 --> 01:35:00,448
Stop, please.

1126
01:35:09,533 --> 01:35:10,727
Wait for me!

1127
01:35:11,133 --> 01:35:12,361
Stop! Stop!

1128
01:35:19,253 --> 01:35:20,288
No!

1129
01:35:26,453 --> 01:35:28,045
Bruno! Carla!

1130
01:35:34,653 --> 01:35:37,087
Bruno! Carla!

1131
01:35:41,893 --> 01:35:42,723
Bruno!

1132
01:35:52,373 --> 01:35:54,967
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1133
01:35:55,573 --> 01:35:56,403
Fuck...

1134
01:35:58,413 --> 01:35:59,528
Where's Carla?

1135
01:36:03,413 --> 01:36:04,323
Where is she?

1136
01:36:07,853 --> 01:36:08,683
Carla!

1137
01:36:17,333 --> 01:36:18,561
Turn her over.

1138
01:36:32,893 --> 01:36:33,803
Are you alright?

1139
01:36:39,973 --> 01:36:41,406
Take her arm.

1140
01:36:43,533 --> 01:36:45,125
Careful, careful.

1141
01:36:48,893 --> 01:36:49,928
Not your helmet. Careful!

1142
01:36:51,053 --> 01:36:52,088
You're okay.

1143
01:36:58,893 --> 01:37:00,963
You can't get rid of us now.

1144
01:38:42,573 --> 01:38:43,608
Come on.
