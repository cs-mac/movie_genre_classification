[Corpse Discovery Site]

3
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,580
Strangulation from behind.
The weapon is a thin rope.

4
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,840
No, actually it's a straw rope.

5
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,140
There are no gaps in the ligature marks
left on his neck.

6
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,060
The culprit strangled the victim without
stopping.

7
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,700
I see.

8
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,960
Without stopping...
You think he was a really big guy?

9
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,580
Can't you even figure that out, you
short-sighted mind? Get out of here already!

10
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,320
This is a sign of electric shock
by a stun gun.

11
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,910
The culprit gave the victim an electric shock to
stop his movement first, then strangled him.

12
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,240
This could be a woman's work.

13
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,660
Captain Yurine.

<i>[Makimura Shinji]
- We're going to carry out the corpse.

15
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:21,260
Oh, I'm sorry.
Akagi-san, are you finished...?

16
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,490
Huh? Akagi-san?

17
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,340
Akagi-san?

18
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,947
Nothing at all.

19
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,760
- What are you missing?
- Both the corpse and the method are too clean.

20
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,970
I don't like this culprit.

21
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,000
<i>[ST: Scientific Task Force]

22
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,210
The victim was identified by his
fingerprints.

23
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,090
Tadokoro Jun, 24 years old.

24
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,150
<i>The time of the murder was between
11:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m. yesterday.

25
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,290
Identified by his fingerprints means he
had a criminal record?

26
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,370
Seven years ago, Tadokoro
who was 17 at the time

27
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:29,046
picked a fight with Osaki Keisuke,
who was 21 years old at the time

28
00:02:29,046 --> 00:02:32,029
after getting drunk and assaulted him.

29
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,790
<i>Tadokoro neglected Osaki Keisuke, who
fell down after getting beaten.

30
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:41,030
<i>Osaki Keisuke died from a brain contusion
the next day.

31
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,340
Because it was handled as a juvenile crime,
Tadokoro was never put on a criminal trial.

32
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,030
Also, since his parent was a teacher, they considered
it was possible for him to rehabilitate at home

33
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,030
and he was released from the juvenile
reformatory after about one year.

34
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,190
Only one year for killing someone!

35
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,430
Any possible grudges?

36
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:03,030
Parents of Osaki Keisuke, who died,
had alibis.

37
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,910
Osaki Shigeru, the father of Keisuke

38
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,950
has been in the Philippines, where he's
staying during his long-term business trip.

39
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,260
Fuyuki Yoshiko, the mother,
was at the food factory

40
00:03:12,261 --> 00:03:15,570
where she works part-time,
at the time of the murder.

41
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,470
By the way, the parents got divorced
one year after Keisuke died.

42
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,710
- Um, the murder weapon was--
- A thin straw rope with a diameter of about 1 cm.

43
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,710
The fiber of straw rope was found
by the collar.

44
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,470
Just an ordinary straw rope. You can get
it at any home improvement stores.

45
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,030
It'll be difficult to
trace the distribution channel.

46
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,710
- Um, the culprit came from behind--
- He approached the victim from behind

47
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,610
and pressed the stun gun on the back
of the neck to give an electronic shock.

48
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,390
After the victim fell face-down, the culprit
sat astride and strangled him to death.

49
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,590
There were no pieces of evidence, body fluids,
and tissue slices left at the scene.

50
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,690
I wonder what the victim was doing at
the park in the middle of the night?

51
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,570
He says, some people do exercise in
the middle of the night

52
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:54,190
but, that park isn't suitable for exercising,
since there's no playground equipment.

53
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,190
Wasn't he just passing through?

54
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:01,680
If you go across this park, it'll be a shortcut
from the train station to the residential area.

55
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,970
What an acute insight!

56
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,870
Keep it up, since you'll be in charge
after I'm gone.

57
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,430
After you're gone?

58
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,430
Gee, I'm a little dumbfounded.

59
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,390
It's really hard for me to leave
the front line too

60
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,490
but I can't go against orders from
the higher-ups, you know?

61
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,050
This will be my last case in
the front line.

62
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,370
You got fired, didn't you?

63
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,250
Who do you think you're talking to?

64
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,370
I'm being transferred to the Personnel Division
of the Police Administration!

65
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,210
Wow, that's like the most elite division!

66
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,930
Did you know?

67
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,190
- Overly shocked. How come?
- Um...

68
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,690
Well, let's put my bright future
aside for now.

69
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,230
- About the culprit in this case--
- Lieutenant Kikuwaka!

70
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,990
When are you being transferred?

71
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,550
I have some handing over to do, so I'll
come and go for a little while--

72
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,310
Please leave the front line to us...
No, leave everything to me!

73
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:49,970
It'll be also my honor to take over the
position of liaison with the ST!

74
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:54,490
- Well, having said that--
- It'll be just fine!

75
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,240
I see. Well then, I'll leave it to you.

76
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,870
I've been asked!

77
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,124
If there are any problems--

78
00:05:04,124 --> 00:05:07,070
I'll let you know immediately,
so you may rest assured.

79
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,070
Okay.

80
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,170
Tadokoro was the kind of man who assaulted
and killed someone after getting drunk.

81
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,890
It's only natural to make other enemies,
in my opinion.

82
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,430
- Let's start from that--
- Momoko-san, time out!

83
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,930
- Yes.
- Your remark just now sounded like Akagi-san.

84
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,650
Tadokoro-san is the victim,
not the assailant.

85
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,650
Please don't forget that.

86
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:47,730
Oh, no! Her enthusiasm is just
spinning her wheels!

87
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,910
That reminds us of Captain back in
the day, doesn't it?

88
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:55,450
It's totally bad to add Akagi-san's improper
remarks to my spinning wheel!

89
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,010
Please be careful.

90
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,166
I know.

91
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,030
- Captain!
- Yes.

92
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,340
Don't confuse me with that
good-for-nothing.

93
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,390
We're going to see the suspect,
number one.

94
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,980
Yes!

95
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,270
Why is she coming with us?

96
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:21,490
Rather than coming with us,
she's actually leading the way.

97
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,470
<i>- Mom, I'll call you later.
- You always say that and never call back.

98
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:28,410
<i>- It's about the condominium.
- I did buy the condominium

99
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,970
but never said I wouldn't get married.
I'm hanging up now.

100
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:35,670
<i>Quit such a dangerous job at once! I'm so
worried that I can't sleep every night.

101
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:39,770
Mom, I'm on duty right now.
Hanging up now.

102
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,990
I'm sorry about that. Let's go.

103
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,370
- So you bought the condominium.
- The condominium.

104
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,790
- Please don't eavesdrop.
- Did you take out a loan?

105
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:51,290
- There's no way she can buy it in cash.
- I decided after taking thought for the future!

106
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:55,710
Everyone dies alone in the end, so I really shouldn't
expect to rely on someone, you know?

107
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,790
- She has her feet on the ground.
- No, you are greatly mistaken.

108
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,480
Now that life-time employment has
become an illusion

109
00:07:00,481 --> 00:07:02,170
there's no guarantee she'll
sustain her current annual income.

110
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:06,050
Once the loan payment is delayed, you'll still owe
millions of yen even after selling the condominium.

111
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,050
I'll be alright, because I won't get fired.

112
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,910
You should be careful of dying
on duty as well.

113
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:13,010
What kind of human would make
remarks like that?

114
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,790
<i>[5:15 p.m.
Fuyuki Keiko's apartment]

115
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,790
- Thank you for offering incense sticks.
- Not at all.

116
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,890
<i>[Fuyuki Keiko]

117
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:29,410
I can't believe it's been seven years already.

118
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,190
Do you know about the incident this time?

119
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:36,530
The detective came to verify,
you know, my alibi.

120
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,670
- We're sorry.
- Not at all.

121
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,190
I guess I deserve it.

122
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:45,170
Since it's true that I still have a grudge
against the murderer.

123
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,310
Have you ever thought about
killing him yourself?

124
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,130
Akagi-san!

125
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,270
I can't do such a thing...

126
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,770
These are the letters from
all over the country.

127
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:05,640
After Keisuke died, they encouraged
me to 'hang in there'

128
00:08:05,641 --> 00:08:09,490
though they didn't even know
what I looked like.

129
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,810
You just changed the subject.
Are you hiding something?

130
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,870
You're right.

131
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,390
I'll tell you what I really think, Detective.

132
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:28,220
Parents like me believe that surely there
will be a reckoning someday.

133
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:35,690
That God will surely give the murderer
punishment.

134
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:40,310
Without believing that there will be a reckoning,
parents can't continue on living.

135
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,550
I wonder who the person is?

136
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,000
The person who killed Tadokoro for us.

137
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,550
At this moment, the only people who seem to
hold grudges against Tadokoro-san are...

138
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:04,720
the former couple of Oosaki Shigeru-san and Fuyuki
Yoshiko-san, whose son was killed by Tadokoro-san.

139
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,850
But both of them have solid alibis.

140
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,880
Yeah?

141
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:19,650
The culprit knew that the victim would come, or
pass through the park in the middle of the night.

142
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,010
Do you think it would be someone
close to the victim?

143
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,110
Like a lover?

144
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,670
If this was discord between lovers, I'd expect
the ugly feelings to show in the method

145
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,910
but there's nothing remarkable
on the corpse.

146
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,550
Oh? Even Akagi-san understands discord
between man and woman.

147
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,670
But it's still impossible for me to understand the
mind of a good-for-nothing woman

148
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:39,690
who bought a condominium without
forethought out of fear of the future.

149
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,810
- Captain!
- Yes.

150
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,970
The Director is calling you.

151
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,333
<i>[7:25 a.m., Adachi Ward, Hikawa-cho, Izumi Park]
[Second Corpse Discovery Site]

152
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,390
<i>[Kobayashi Eita, The second victim]
- Another corpse of a man was discovered.

153
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,522
Same as Tadokoro, who was discovered yesterday

154
00:09:54,522 --> 00:09:56,089
he was given an electric shock
and strangled from behind.

155
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:59,210
The stun gun and straw rope, the murder weapons,
were probably from the same manufacturers.

156
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,730
- You think these are serial murders?
- It's not definite yet.

157
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,550
I thought it was the ST's job to
assess that, is it not?

158
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,590
- You're right. We'll do our best.
- I don't need your best.

159
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:12,510
Just bring me the resolution of the case.

160
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,164
Yes, ma'am.

161
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,570
Oh...

162
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,270
It's about Lieutenant Kikukawa's
transfer...

163
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,926
Did you call me?

164
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,150
I heard you were leaving the front line.

165
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:34,790
Oh, was I supposed to bid
farewell to you?

166
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:39,310
Honestly I wasn't really involved with you
two, so I didn't think it was necessary.

167
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,610
Captain Yurine is worried.

168
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,790
Sorry? What is he worried about?

169
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:48,490
He's actually worried about Sergeant
Tsutsui Momoko after you're gone.

170
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,250
Oh, I see.
I already know that.

171
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,550
I'm planning to advise her plenty
later on, as a senior.

172
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:58,230
Then, it's all good.

173
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,610
We're going to miss you.

174
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,911
Once you leave the front line.

175
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,210
Well, to be honest I'm also sad

176
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:16,030
but I was relieved that the guys in ST
didn't seem to care at all.

177
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,110
Really, it's exactly the same method
of killing as Tadokoro.

178
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,850
The victim is Kobayashi Eita, 28 years old.

179
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,710
Lived in Nishi Arai, Adachi Ward.

180
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:34,370
His occupation was a part-timer at
the restaurant bar.

181
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,090
Same as Tadokoro, we haven't found his
wallet and cell phone

182
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,210
but the body was identified by its fingerprints.

183
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,410
Identified by the fingerprints again?

184
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:45,250
Kobayashi had a past of being charged four
years ago, with stalking and murdering

185
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,690
Niijima Yuna, who was
18 years old at the time.

186
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:48,910
Was the case against him dropped?

187
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:55,130
The parents of Niijima Yuna, had reported
Kobayashi's stalking to the police at the time

188
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:59,070
but there was only circumstantial evidence
 and they couldn't indict him for the crime.

189
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,070
Was the culprit arrested later on?

190
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,310
No.

191
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:05,710
The crime scenes were both at
parks similar in size.

192
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:09,030
Taking away the items which can identify
the victim, is also the same.

193
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:12,970
More than anything, two people who made enemies
in the past were killed with the same method.

194
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,310
That's the biggest thing in common.

195
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:18,650
The common point is...

196
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,230
What are you doing, Captain?

197
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:25,270
I'm entering all the information here. This will
make it easier to write the investigation report.

198
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,610
- So you stopped using your notepad.
- Yes.

199
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,150
I see.

200
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,370
Okay, here we go.

201
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,930
The murder case of Tadokoro and
Kobayashi this time.

202
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:36,330
By the look of the clean condition of the corpse,
the killings were prepared carefully and done well.

203
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:40,230
The culprit is probably highly educated, established
in a profession, and has higher social status.

204
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,770
This person pays attention to the crime information
through mass media and such.

205
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,130
Married, probably.
And no criminal record.

206
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,640
No criminal record.

207
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,872
Would it be possible for someone who's totally
unrelated to commit the crime

208
00:12:50,873 --> 00:12:52,488
for the sake of social justice?

209
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:55,850
In that case, there should be a social appeal,
like leaving a common mark.

210
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,510
I've just received a report.

211
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,950
Niijima Yasuhiro, the father of Niijima Yuna,
whom Kobayashi was stalking

212
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:05,370
testified that he was working alone at the
university at the estimated time of the crime.

213
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,430
The university?

214
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,670
Niijima is a professor of criminal psychology
at Seinan University.

215
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,370
Seriously?
We're in the same business?

216
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,730
At this point, there's no eyewitness testimony.
Niijima doesn't have an alibi.

217
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:15,790
How about his wife?

218
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:19,710
Around the time of the crime, she received the
phone calls at home from her friend and her parents

219
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,710
and had conversations with them.
That's been confirmed.

220
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,340
This is the professor in question.

221
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,830
It says, the internet course.

222
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,830
<i>- [Professor Niijima Yasuhiro]
- It is normally thought that

223
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,950
<i>the murderer has the motive
and the purpose.

224
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,470
<i>And, the case in which the killing
itself is the purpose

225
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:42,100
<i>and the murderer gets pleasure from
the killing, is called lust murder.

226
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,010
Professor Niijima also works here,
in addition to the university.

227
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,890
He must have a private office
or something.

228
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:56,950
Scholars of the human race like to claim
their territories, you know?

229
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,890
That's just a prejudice.

230
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,910
<i>[1:40 p.m., Niijima's office]
- Akagi-san, you'll get yelled at

231
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:10,470
if you touch his things without permission.
Are you listening?

232
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,450
I apologize for the wait.

233
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,350
Thank you very much for making
time in your busy schedule.

234
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,850
Not at all. Please have a seat.

235
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:23,550
It is the duty of a citizen to cooperate
with a police investigation.

236
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,670
As someone who teaches criminal psychology

237
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,110
I wanted to be helpful,
even if just a little.

238
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,210
We appreciate your cooperation.

239
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:35,030
Now, did you get any eyewitness
information?

240
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,210
Not yet.

241
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,850
Did you find the murder weapon?

242
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,470
- No.
- We can't tell you such a thing.

243
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,670
Oh, I see.

244
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,270
But, there isn't much traffic in those areas

245
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:57,410
and as I recall, there weren't any security cameras
at the convenience store or the ATM machine nearby.

246
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:04,610
The culprit made them look like thefts by
taking away the victims' personal belongings

247
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:11,030
but far from it, I'd say these were
planned very carefully.

248
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,630
Are you saying that the culprit is not
a random attacker

249
00:15:13,631 --> 00:15:16,230
but more likely to have clearly
targeted the victims?

250
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,730
Yes.

251
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:24,400
In the case of serial murders, I'm more
concerned about the motive.

252
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:30,710
Oh, I guess they haven't been necessarily
determined as serial murders yet.

253
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,550
Do you think Kobayashi was the murderer
who killed your daughter?

254
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,710
Come on, Akagi-san!

255
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:41,023
I don't know that.

256
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,450
Do you hold a grudge against the police,
who couldn't arrest the murderer?

257
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,910
What are you saying?

258
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,370
No, it's alright.

259
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:56,150
As a parent, there's no greater pain than
the murder of my own child.

260
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:59,410
However, holding a grudge against the police
won't bring my daughter back.

261
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:05,510
In the same way, even killing the murderer
a million times won't bring my daughter back.

262
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:08,630
How did you feel when you heard
Kobayashi was killed?

263
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:12,390
It's the fact that Kobayashi was
stalking my daughter.

264
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:15,090
And my daughter was killed.

265
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:20,310
But the police didn't think that Kobayashi
was the murderer.

266
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:25,190
From this point on,
it's a matter of my personal feelings.

267
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,950
I don't think it's necessary to
answer that question.

268
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:30,090
You said that it's no use to hold a grudge
against the police.

269
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:34,130
But it's only natural to hold a grudge
against the incompetent police

270
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,890
which couldn't arrest the murderer
of your daughter.

271
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:42,810
As someone who studies crimes, I understand
that not every criminal cases can be solved.

272
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,410
And it's not because the police
are incompetent.

273
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:51,430
But, there are some criminals beyond
the long arm of the law.

274
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:59,290
That's why I convinced myself that it's no use
to hold a grudge against the police.

275
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:03,861
Is it okay if we finish now? I have some
other work to do.

276
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,530
He sure is a professor of criminal
psychology, as expected.

277
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:18,390
Until I brought up his daughter as a topic,
he didn't say a word on her case.

278
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:21,010
Normally he would have been the first
to talk about his daughter.

279
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,010
Now that you mentioned it...

280
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,750
But, maybe he just didn't want to bring it up.

281
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,890
He's the kind of person who's always cool
and never influenced by his emotions.

282
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,936
He wouldn't have killed someone over a grudge.

283
00:17:30,936 --> 00:17:32,709
But, grudges aren't the only motives
for murder.

284
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,810
Are you saying that Professor Niijima
is suspicious?

285
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:37,770
But, even though Professor Niijima may
have the motive to kill Kobayashi-san

286
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:41,670
he doesn't have a motive to
kill Tadokoro-san.

287
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,590
Oh, Momoko-san.

288
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,750
<i>[2:34 p.m., Niijima Residence]
- What did you come here to do?

289
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,150
I came to question Niijima Haruna-san.

290
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,470
My questions will suffice.
Get out of here already!

291
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,150
We've visited your husband's office just now.

292
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,490
I see.

293
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,490
Haruna-san, what do you do for work?

294
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,470
I do translation work at home

295
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,470
just enough to earn a little bit
of extra money.

296
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:15,390
You were here the whole time last night?

297
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,553
Yes.

298
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,290
- What were you doing?
- Excuse me?

299
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,550
Your husband has been secluding
himself in his office.

300
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,470
What were you doing at home
by yourself?

301
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:28,350
I think you already know my
alibi last night, but

302
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:35,490
I just took a bath and watched TV after
having dinner by myself last night.

303
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:41,910
And at the time of the crime, I was talking to my
friend in the United States on my home phone.

304
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,250
That's why the call was made in
the middle of the night.

305
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:50,643
- And we'd like to verify one more--
- Can't the police arrest the murderer of Yuna yet?

306
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,260
We're sorry.

307
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:02,310
For Niijima Haruna-san, not only the murderer
of her daughter

308
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:06,430
but also the police, which haven't been able to
arrest that murderer, must be the subject of hatred.

309
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:09,390
She seems to be distracting herself
from grief with anger.

310
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:12,150
And taking her eyes off the past
she doesn't want to face.

311
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,270
I guess it's only natural for the parent
whose child has died.

312
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:20,410
On the contrary, Keisuke-kun's mother seemed
to be immersed in grief.

313
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,590
Stop babbling about nothing.

314
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,670
These are about the people involved in these
cases. They're not nothing!

315
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:28,410
Then, let me ask you. Did you just say
she was immersed in grief?

316
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:31,930
Can you really see someone else's mind?

317
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,690
I can at least feel it.

318
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,690
She can't throw away any of her
son's belongings

319
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,530
and his ashes haven't been placed
in a grave yet.

320
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,750
There's no need to feel, even a fool can see it.
You're less than a fool.

321
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,690
Those two have the strong motives.

322
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:46,639
Do the parents whose children were killed all
take their revenge?

323
00:19:46,639 --> 00:19:51,810
That aside, it's also important to investigate
thoroughly when something catches your attention.

324
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:57,530
Everyone's anxious about the future, but
that's also why they embrace their lives.

325
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:02,848
But I think, for a mother whose child has died,
it was about the same as having no future.

326
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:08,590
Since they have their alibis, what about
the exchange of murders?

327
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:11,930
Why now? I've already thought about
that possibility a long time ago.

328
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:15,470
But, we can break their alibis if these
were exchanged murders!

329
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:18,810
You said that, by the look of the killing method,
the culprit could be a woman.

330
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:23,450
Is this kindergarten? Do I have to say
the same thing again and again?

331
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,530
Niijima Haruna is highly educated,
but too emotional.

332
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,590
And she doesn't fit the profiling of someone
who has higher social status.

333
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:32,370
It's impossible for Fuyuki Yoshiko to come
up with this plan.

334
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:35,730
Also, those two had no point of contact
whatsoever, like the hobby group

335
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:40,910
the supermarket they use, the acquaintances
before marriage, or their regular clinic.

336
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,450
There may be something we overlooked.

337
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,790
Don't let your emotions rule you.
Analyze calmly using your brain.

338
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,870
The crime scene, the corpse, and the evidences.

339
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,690
There's nothing uncertain in those.

340
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,770
There must be a meaning in the
uncertain feelings as well!

341
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,910
That'll just get in your way, you idiot!

342
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:58,250
Akagi-san! I think you've gone too far!

343
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,170
I'm not your puppet!

344
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,890
I'm acting on my own ideas
as a detective!

345
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:08,090
Wonderful. That's totally welcomed.
You're not even a member of the ST.

346
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,430
Just act on your own ideas as you please.

347
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,750
Sorry to disturb you!

348
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,750
Don't forget the loan payment.

349
00:21:22,194 --> 00:21:24,690
Ugh....

350
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,470
Hey, hey, hey! What's the matter?

351
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:31,690
I'm expressing my anger! Can't you see
the steam coming out of my head?

352
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,170
Did Akagi twist you around his finger?

353
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:38,243
Are you getting ready for the transfer?
I envy your optimism.

354
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:42,690
Oh, I'm sorry.
Was I just rude to you?

355
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:48,590
No, I was going to give you advice as a senior
who's been angry at the ST

356
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,590
but I'm at a loss for words.

357
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,770
Yurine is really amazing, you know?
While being with those guys

358
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:57,796
- he's even worried about you.
- About me?

359
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:01,310
Don't you think he should have been worried
about my future after the sudden transfer first?

360
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,970
- It would be nice if there is a farewell party for me.
- Oh...

361
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:07,330
I'm kidding.
I don't care about that.

362
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,790
Solve these cases for me.

363
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:12,310
Yes.

364
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:15,870
The only thing I learned from being
involved with the ST was that

365
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:20,550
I'm no match for them,
no matter how hard I try.

366
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:25,650
A good-for-nothing like me could never
understand those guys at all.

367
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:32,550
But, I think we still can go along with it even
though it may be impossible to understand.

368
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:35,690
- Wow.
- What's the matter with you?

369
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:38,390
You're amazing!
That is absolutely right!

370
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:42,590
How didn't I notice such an important thing?

371
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:46,945
I'm off to make inquiries!

372
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,988
Was I able to say it without making
much of my seniority?

373
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,790
In both cases, the murder weapon and
the method are the same.

374
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,790
But, there's no evidence at all.

375
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,170
The first victim got the reduced sentence
for the past crime

376
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:08,710
because he was a minor and his parent
was a teacher.

377
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:11,403
The second victim was an assailant of stalking.

378
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,750
He was suspected of the murder of the stalking
victim, but acquitted for lack of sufficient evidence.

379
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,850
But, the public and the surviving family seem to
think that the stalker was the murderer.

380
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:23,550
The grudges, and revenge.

381
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:26,950
Momoko-san is concerned about the mothers
whose children were killed.

382
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,730
Huh, what a nerve!

383
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,270
You're just annoyed because she has
the same opinion as you.

384
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:35,010
I get goosebumps knowing that my close reasoning
coincides with her random guess, even by accident.

385
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:41,310
It's not a random guess. She's trying hard to think
about the victim's feelings in her own way.

386
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:43,670
In a criminal case,
the evidence means everything.

387
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:47,270
But as you know, it's human feelings that
causes criminal cases.

388
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:53,267
By being close to the human feeling, you may be able
to get closer to the culprit and the victim.

389
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:57,416
You also need to make an effort to understand
other people, as a police officer.

390
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,313
Anyway...

391
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:06,791
Where do you think the feeling of someone
who lost the loved one should go?

392
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,020
Sorry?

393
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:21,690
So this is geographic profiling, huh?

394
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:26,750
Right. Two murders took place
here and here.

395
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,910
By making each crime scene
a center point

396
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:34,110
you draw a circle with the radius of the distance
which you can travel within an hour on foot.

397
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:38,910
- And then?
- You designate the area where the circles overlap

398
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,470
as the living point.

399
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:44,050
But, not much to do with this little
information, you know?

400
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:47,065
Hey, what are you two doing together?

401
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,033
I was teaching her some profiling.

402
00:24:49,033 --> 00:24:51,499
I thought I should study a little.

403
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,850
I see.

404
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:56,890
It's hard to find the common denominator
since we only have two cases.

405
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:00,382
If we have one or two more cases...

406
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:05,790
Oh, sorry. That wasn't a proper thing
to say, was it?

407
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:08,220
It's fine as long as you understand that.

408
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:13,170
Also, I've read in the autopsy
report just now.

409
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:16,850
Kobayashi, the second victim, lost consciousness
by an electric shock once

410
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:20,450
but woke up while being strangled,
and resisted.

411
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,450
The dirt between his fingernails.

412
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:25,037
The dried dirt doesn't penetrate like that,
from just falling down on the ground.

413
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:29,590
It's the evidence of him grabbing the dirt tightly
after falling down by an electric shock.

414
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:32,430
Why didn't you tell me if you had
already known?

415
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,330
It was quite obvious, you know?

416
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:36,190
- And also--
- Do you have some more?

417
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:39,330
If he was strangled to death
without stopping

418
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:42,750
the thickness of the ligature marks on his neck
shouldn't change depending on the area.

419
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,650
That means, this isn't by the same culprit,
and there may be more than one?

420
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,650
That's possible.

421
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:55,270
And whether it's the same culprit
or more than one

422
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:58,236
there's only one person who
fits the profiling.

423
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,870
<i>[Interrogation Room, Number One]
- On that day

424
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:06,630
I was writing a paper in my office
at the university

425
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,810
because the deadline for presenting it at
an academic conference was approaching.

426
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:14,010
I don't detect any changes in the pitch
of his voice. He's not lying.

427
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:18,223
When a human tells a lie, his body naturally
gets slanted from the other party.

428
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,010
Niijima's body is facing right in the center.

429
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:24,863
If I could check on the pupils of his eyes, I
would be able to tell even more precisely.

430
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,590
Is there someone who can prove that?

431
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:31,579
I talked to my wife on my cell phone

432
00:26:31,579 --> 00:26:35,673
other than that, there was
no one I talked to or saw on that day.

433
00:26:35,674 --> 00:26:38,590
Do you often spend the night
at the university?

434
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:41,070
Yes, when I get busy.

435
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:44,050
His behavior does seem suspicious
if you nitpick.

436
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:46,670
He might have been able to write
a paper at home.

437
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:49,050
But he's not lying.

438
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:53,990
With the 'organized' type, the culprit often
anticipates the police interrogation.

439
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:57,629
His dignified manner may be
just an act.

440
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,230
Niijima Yasuhiro-san had an alibi?

441
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,570
There was more than one eyewitness
testimony.

442
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:06,570
It's a perfect alibi.

443
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,441
At the time of the crime

444
00:27:14,441 --> 00:27:17,450
a few students who were spending the
night for the event during the summer break

445
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:21,170
saw Professor Niijima in his office
through the window.

446
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:25,157
Aoyama-san and Midori-san said that
Niijima-san wasn't lying.

447
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:28,226
That means, the investigation is back
where you started.

448
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,924
Yes, ma'am.

449
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,230
What are you going to do?

450
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,530
That's...

451
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:40,850
Some things may go out of sight if you
only see things logically.

452
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:45,277
The person who depends only on the
theory can never escape its spell.

453
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:51,210
I thought that the ST had been investigating
the case without abandoning every possibility.

454
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,255
I'll tell you my personal opinion.

455
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:01,510
A human can't commit murder so easily.

456
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:04,530
In the background of almost every murder

457
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:07,670
whether it is good or bad

458
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,670
there lies the earnest truth.

459
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,400
That's what I think.

460
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,611
Thank you, ma'am.

461
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:24,616
The dirt between his fingernails.

462
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,210
Slight differences in the killing method.

463
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,210
More than one culprit.

464
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,990
The exchange murders by the mothers.

465
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:37,262
But, the mothers don't fit the criminal profile
and in the first place--

466
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,790
In the first place, without the point of contact
between Fuyuki Yoshiko and Niijima Haruna

467
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,990
the exchange murders wouldn't take place.

468
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,490
That's right.

469
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:48,270
Let's investigate the mothers' surroundings
thoroughly all over again.

470
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,390
We need to look for the point of
contact between the two mothers.

471
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:53,410
That's the necessary condition for
this exchange of murders.

472
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,390
I'll continue on making inquiries.

473
00:29:01,219 --> 00:29:03,422
Have you ever seen these two?

474
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,970
No, I haven't.

475
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,970
I see. Thank you anyway.

476
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,890
Thank you very much. Thanks.

477
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:22,107
Alright!

478
00:29:34,132 --> 00:29:37,390
<i>[5:45 p.m., Near Niijima Residence]
- Haruna-san used to be an active person

479
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:41,730
but she rarely goes out ever since
Yuna-chan's incident.

480
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:46,650
Um, have you noticed something strange
about the Niijimas lately?

481
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:49,030
- Come to think of it.
- Come to think of it?

482
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,010
Mr. Niijima has been coming home late.

483
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:54,510
Or actually he doesn't come home
sometimes.

484
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:57,790
He also seems to go out by himself
on his days off.

485
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,570
Haruna-san doesn't go out with him?

486
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:03,210
I haven't seen them together lately.

487
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:07,350
I used to see them together in a place like
the supermarket until just a little while ago.

488
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:09,350
I see.

489
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:16,460
<i>[In 2007, my son died at 21 years old.
I'm the mother who can't accept it yet.] 

490
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:27,649
This must be it.

491
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,690
According to the people who
know the Niijimas

492
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:37,350
things are getting worse between the couple
after Kobayashi was killed.

493
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:42,430
If they thought he was the murderer, I would
normally expect them to feel even a little better.

494
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,170
Things got worse between the couple.

495
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:46,070
Yes.

496
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:50,430
Tsutsui.
Your reasoning is correct.

497
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:53,210
Well done. This is your first step
to your success.

498
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:54,346
What?

499
00:30:54,346 --> 00:30:58,236
And as for the point of contact between
Fuyuki Yoshiko and Niijima Haruna.

500
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,710
This is Fuyuki Yoshiko's blog.

501
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:08,350
There was someone posting comments in
there, with the handle name, 'Spring.'

502
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:11,090
I've checked out the comment made by the same
person in the other websites on the internet.

503
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:14,170
Judging from the time of the incident of losing
a child and the contents of the comment

504
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:18,223
I can assure you that this person
is Niijima Haruna.

505
00:31:18,223 --> 00:31:20,220
What?

506
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:25,350
Fuyuki Yoshiko-san and Niijima Haruna-san
are connected now!

507
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,450
Thank you very much!

508
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:29,730
But, there's no clue written here,
which may lead to the crime.

509
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:31,670
This isn't strong enough.

510
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:36,110
Captain, interview those two mothers
tomorrow.

511
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,460
Yes!

512
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:43,282
This is the blog you've written, isn't it?

513
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:45,970
Yes.

514
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:52,010
You've posted about hatred and grudges against
the murderer, and grief for the loss of Keisuke-kun.

515
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,650
The last time you updated this blog was

516
00:31:54,650 --> 00:32:00,350
on the day of the murder of Tadokoro-san,
who had killed Keisuke-kun.

517
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:04,490
- I heard about it on the news--
- And there was no need to write anymore?

518
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,610
I decided to live facing forward
from now on.

519
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:15,250
I've finally laid his ashes to rest, which I
couldn't do for a long time.

520
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:18,250
She's not lying.

521
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,419
Do you know Kobayashi Eita-san?

522
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,830
No.

523
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:25,710
That's a lie.

524
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,950
Is that true?

525
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:33,890
I'm sorry. Come to think of it, I think
I heard of him on the news.

526
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:35,890
That's not a lie.

527
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:40,010
Do you remember the name
Niijima Haruna-san?

528
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,010
No.

529
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:43,070
Not a lie.

530
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:46,010
Kobayashi Eita-san was murdered.

531
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:50,970
Haven't you known
Kobayashi Eita-san from before?

532
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:56,730
I don't know!
I've never known such a man!

533
00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:01,159
That's... not a lie.

534
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,395
<i>[Interrogation Room, Number Two]

535
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,030
Do you know the person who
writes this blog?

536
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:10,310
If I had known that person, I wouldn't be
able to write these kind of things.

537
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:12,790
And you don't post your comments anymore?

538
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:17,270
Even if I carry on like this, that won't
bring my daughter back.

539
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:24,350
Have you ever wished to take revenge
for your child?

540
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:29,550
- Yes, I have.
- Have you ever thought of killing Kobayashi?

541
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:33,290
- Yes, I have.
- Did you kill Kobayashi?

542
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:34,070
No.

543
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:36,730
On the day before the stalker of
your daughter was killed

544
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:40,050
another person was murdered with
the same method.

545
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:42,050
Did you do it?

546
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,971
- What are you talking about?
- You've been jolted just now.

547
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,470
I wonder if there's someone who
wouldn't get jolted

548
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:53,906
after being brought up to a place like this
and treated as a suspect.

549
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:57,050
It's no use telling us lies.

550
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:00,539
Do you have any proof that I did it?

551
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,013
What do you think?

552
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:26,882
So they don't know each other?

553
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:36,950
If these were exchanged murders, they should
have known about the person they killed.

554
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:41,670
But Fuyuki Yoshiko-san didn't know anything
about Kobayashi Eita-san, except the name.

555
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:45,690
And of all things,
those two don't know each other.

556
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:48,510
That actually brought me
to an answer.

557
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,335
- Sorry?
- What do you mean by that?

558
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:53,550
There's only one mystery left.

559
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,710
The question is how.

560
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,959
Captain, even she brought an important
clue this time.

561
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:00,995
Why can't you become useful,
even a little?

562
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,120
I don't even know what's what.

563
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:12,410
Ahh!

564
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,150
You scared me!

565
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:19,030
Captain, thank you for trying to keep me
awake, but I'm not sleepy yet.

566
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:21,030
All gone!

567
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:23,030
All of my efforts...

568
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,741
were for nothing.

569
00:35:29,741 --> 00:35:31,740
What's happening?

570
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,570
My memos.

571
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,530
My memos...

572
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:40,090
Oh, I see. Anything and everything
Yurine-kun was entering.

573
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:42,390
Don't put it simply like that!

574
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,290
Those were very important
memos for me!

575
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:50,813
Oh, why? I should have kept my usual
notepad as always!

576
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,350
The lost data.

577
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,190
The documents which cannot be
thrown away.

578
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,140
It's the paper (kami).

579
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,610
You're right.
God (kami-sama) is so cruel.

580
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:07,216
Stop making a bad joke.

581
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:16,570
Ugh...

582
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:22,550
Because of you... and Captain...

583
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:27,150
the mysteries... have been solved!

584
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:30,210
Ugh!

585
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:32,337
I don't need these anymore!

586
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:44,149
My head is going to burst!

587
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,220
Captain! All the mysteries have
been solved!

588
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:57,960
In regards to those two cases this time, we wanted
to ask your opinion as a criminal psychologist.

589
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,180
Let me start first.

590
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,420
If you were to kill someone,
how would you do it?

591
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:06,040
<i>That's a very interesting question.

592
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,527
By the way, who are you?
Are you with the police?

593
00:37:08,527 --> 00:37:09,614
- Yeah.

594
00:37:09,614 --> 00:37:12,020
I have a PhD in criminal psychology
in the United States.

595
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,620
Oh, that's impressive.

596
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,680
And?

597
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,420
Let me see, if I were to do it...

598
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:23,323
The bones, the flesh, and the hair.

599
00:37:23,323 --> 00:37:27,398
I would eliminate all the
body parts from this world first.

00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,582
I agree.

601
00:37:28,582 --> 00:37:32,680
How about the mental state of the criminal,
who strangles the opponent

602
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,431
after making him unconscious by giving
an electric shock?

603
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:42,672
I guess it's possible to use a strategy like that,
if the opponent surpasses you in strength.

604
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:45,000
What's the reason to strangle
from behind?

605
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:52,380
In cases of killing without seeing the victim's face,
or covering up the face of the dead body

606
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:59,079
I guess it's safe to consider that the
culprit had some sense of guilt.

607
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,348
Right.

608
00:38:00,348 --> 00:38:04,320
Committing a crime must be easy
with your knowledge.

609
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,740
Isn't it the same with the police officers?

610
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:13,470
But police officers wouldn't commit a crime
so easily. Isn't that right?

611
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:21,077
By the way, did you figure out
who the culprit is?

612
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,060
The ones who executed the murders were

613
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:29,452
the mothers who wished to take revenge
for their children.

614
00:38:29,452 --> 00:38:31,288
<i>[Niijima Residence]

615
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,300
And the person who planned the
exchange murders was

616
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,400
you, Professor Niijima.

617
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:49,780
Well, well!

618
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,980
What are you saying so abruptly?

619
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,400
It's impossible for the mothers to commit
these crimes by themselves.

620
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,240
But with your brains, it can happen.

621
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,020
Just two mothers getting connected wouldn't
have started an act of revenge.

622
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:06,180
It didn't become reality until you
got involved.

623
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:09,780
And you must have left evidence
somewhere.

624
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,160
- Evidence?
- Something which proves you planned it.

625
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,800
My plan for the exchanged murders...

626
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,420
Where do you think it is?

627
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:20,140
This office must be considered a
part of your brains.

628
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:24,240
This place has your knowledge and everything
else you've earned in my life so far.

629
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:30,720
You must've hesitated to keep crime-related material
at home with your wife, after your daughter had died.

630
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,483
I'm certain that the evidence is in this room.

631
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:39,960
And in the most sacred place for you.

632
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,980
I'm sure you know this since you're a
professor of psychology

633
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:49,140
but, when a human lies, he averts his gaze or
the area around the mouth gets tightened.

634
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,000
And also, when someone hits the nail
on the head.

635
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:54,210
Evidence?

636
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,280
By the way, when a human lies, he tends to
cover up the face with hands

637
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,460
and that's why you've been holding that pen
with both hands all this time. Right?

638
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,769
But, it's too bad.

639
00:40:13,769 --> 00:40:20,419
Unconsciously your eyes and the direction of
your body showed us where the hiding place was.

640
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,440
The most important thing for you.

641
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,209
The happiest time of your life.

642
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:36,010
The evidence is...

643
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:40,384
right here.

644
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,455
Bingo!

645
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,397
It's a copy of the letter.

646
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,680
Our Captain here doesn't trust
the computer data

647
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,640
which could be glanced by the hackers or
recovered even after being erased.

648
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,180
As a matter of fact, there are many
organizations which don't

649
00:41:04,181 --> 00:41:06,720
store the important data on the server
or the network anymore.

650
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,880
Since there's a risk of getting it stolen.

651
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,840
Oh, but of course you must
already know that.

652
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:16,700
That's why you wrote a letter, which will
disappear completely when burned.

653
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:22,700
<i>Your target will pass through Izumi Park, Hikawa-cho,
Adachi Ward, right after 12:00 a.m. on August 20.

654
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,800
The detailed instructions for the murder weapon
and even the disposal method are written here.

655
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,140
Your wife found Fuyuki Yoshiko's blog
on the internet.

656
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:31,000
We've already verified their accounts.

657
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,480
Two of them must have become close right
away, since they both had their children killed.

658
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,174
<i>[I'll make him pay for it no matter what.]

659
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:44,740
What's the good of doing this?
Stop it!

660
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,930
Stop it already!

661
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:53,490
You must have tried to stop those mothers when
you learned they wished to take revenge.

662
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:56,100
But they didn't give up on their revenge.

663
00:41:56,100 --> 00:42:00,340
That's why you planned two murders by
putting all your knowledge in full force

664
00:42:00,341 --> 00:42:02,460
before your wife took action.

665
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:06,640
You chose exchanged murders so that
the mothers would have the impregnable alibis.

666
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,240
And Niijima Haruna killed Tadokoro Jun, even
without knowing what he looked like.

667
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:17,680
<i>In order to make it look like
the same culprit's work

668
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:22,620
<i>you prepared the clothes, the shoes and
the murder weapon for Fuyuki Yoshiko

669
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,800
<i>and mapped out the plan for
the exchange murders.

670
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:30,694
<i>And Fuyuki Yoshiko took revenge for
her son without hesitation.

671
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:38,080
After Kobayashi was killed, you dared
to treat your wife coldly

672
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,800
because you were afraid of the police
getting suspicious of you two.

673
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,373
So that you two don't look like the
parents succeeded in revenge.

674
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:48,280
Your neighbor was wondering why things were
getting worse between you two than before.

675
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:53,100
Even though the killing method was
written in that letter

676
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:56,580
that doesn't necessarily point out
who the culprit is.

677
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:59,540
- It's just a copy.
- Stop making a disgraceful excuse.

678
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:03,393
There's no evidence which proves who
actually committed the murders!

679
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:09,200
By now, our people are meeting with
your wife and Fuyuki Yoshiko-san.

680
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,000
For those mothers,
taking revenge was justice.

681
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,620
I'm sure that they won't be
able to keep lying.

682
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:17,974
No, they will choose not to keep lying.

683
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:21,000
Do you still have some business with me?

684
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,480
Excuse me.

685
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:38,210
<i>This is Tsutsui. I found it.

686
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:41,180
Understood.

687
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:46,040
The original of that letter was found
in Fuyuki Yoshiko's apartment.

688
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:52,420
- Why?
- Fuyuki Yoshiko kept every single letter

689
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:55,320
which had been supporting her,
with great care.

690
00:43:55,320 --> 00:44:00,640
If it was the letter that helped her take revenge
for her son, she would surely keep it as well.

691
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:05,240
It was you who investigated the surroundings and
behavior patterns of Tadokoro-san and Kobayashi-san

692
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,293
and also established the alibis.

693
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,619
Not only those mothers have never met

694
00:44:12,619 --> 00:44:15,080
but they didn't know each
other's names or even the murder plan.

695
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:19,002
They just followed your instructions.

696
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:24,980
Was this copy of the letter the sign of
your revenge against the police

697
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:28,660
- which couldn't arrest your daughter's murderer?
- Captain, you're wrong.

698
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:32,680
This letter is nothing like a war trophy or
the sign of revenge.

699
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,800
This is the evidence to protect
the mothers.

700
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,540
To protect the mothers?

701
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:42,480
He dared to keep the evidence in order to prove
that he planned and led two murders

702
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,749
in the unlikely event that the mothers were
arrested by the police.

703
00:44:53,290 --> 00:45:00,911
I guess it didn't matter whether I
kept this or not in the end.

704
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:07,151
Since my plan...
ended in complete failure.

705
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:24,720
Get a hold of yourself! Stop it!

706
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,720
Stop it! Stop it!

707
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,720
Stop it!

708
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,143
Who's going to pass judgment on that man,
if the law won't do it?

709
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:37,647
Who's going to end this hell for me?

710
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:42,407
<i>She was already at her limit.

711
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:49,893
<i>No matter how many times I stop my wife,
she'll surely kill Koboyashi someday.

712
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,280
Just because you couldn't stop your wife

713
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:58,460
why would you plan the murders after
knowing everything about crime?

714
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:02,820
There are limits in what the police and the
judiciary can do.

715
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:09,012
I had no choice but to save her
from suffering.

716
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:13,180
Don't be stupid! You just committed murder
using your knowledge.

717
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:16,820
To avenge your daughter's death and
archive your wife's revenge.

718
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:21,760
That's just self-satisfaction of the
murderer and a pathetic excuse.

719
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,520
How would you know the feelings of
parents whose child was killed?

720
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:30,800
We're in hell every single day and even
though we don't want the future anymore

721
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,771
we're forced to continue living while our
hearts are stabbed by the invisible knives.

722
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:37,960
Do you really think you can understand
how we feel?

723
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,326
He laughed.

724
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:47,600
When we passed each other in the corridor
of the police station, he laughed at us.

725
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,580
Lust murder? Don't talk rubbish!

726
00:46:54,580 --> 00:47:00,580
We won't stand having our daughter
killed for pleasure!

727
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:02,760
What you're experiencing must be
as bitter as death.

728
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,040
It must be like living in hell.

729
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,160
But revenge creates only a
cycle of retaliation.

730
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:13,476
While being the victim's family,
you created another victim's family!

731
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:16,880
You're just a murderer.

732
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,860
I'm sorry, Keisuke!

733
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,297
I'm so sorry.

734
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:43,473
<i>I don't regret what I've done.

735
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:52,400
The only regret I have is that I couldn't
save my daughter.

736
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,138
That's all.

737
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:05,960
Niijima Haruna and Fuyuki Yoshiko.
They both confessed.

738
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:16,120
Perhaps, the cause of the crime is much
more of a familiar thing than we think.

739
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,560
Hey! What's this?
Where are the others?

740
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,960
Oh, they went home.

741
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,280
You should have told me if you were coming
to say good-bye.

742
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,580
That's not it! What's wrong with them, even
though I went to the trouble of coming here?

743
00:48:29,753 --> 00:48:31,320
<i>[Don't look.]

744
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,778

<i>[Thank you very much for everything!]

<i>[Go away already!]

749
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:52,580
What the heck are these?

750
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:55,730
Don't you have something
I could use?

751
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,420
Hey! Akagi, what are you doing?
Hey!

752
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:10,080
- If you have no use, I'll use them.
- Give me back! Give me back! Give back!

753
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:13,340
- Tsutsui!
- Yes.

754
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:15,395
These guys are just hopeless.

755
00:49:15,395 --> 00:49:17,279
This is what I get after taking care
of them for two years, you know?

756
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,669
That's a great weight off my mind.

757
00:49:19,669 --> 00:49:22,140
I feel sorry that
you're going to have a hard time!

758
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,151
I'll be sure to suffer!

759
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:28,260
Kikukawa-san, thank you very much!

760
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,400
A criminal psychologist,
who became a monster.

761
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,020
There are limits in what the police and
the judiciary can do.

762
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:47,836
Someone who's closely related to the crime

763
00:49:47,837 --> 00:49:53,468
should be more careful not to
commit a crime or to become a monster.

764
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:57,107
It's the same with the police officer.

765
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:00,680
I may become...

766
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,680
Akagi-san won't become a monster.

767
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:06,204
- Why can you say something like that?
- I'll make sure to stop you.

768
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:12,622
As for you, Captain... I will...

769
00:50:21,787 --> 00:50:25,860
