1
00:01:19,763 --> 00:01:22,857
Hi, son. You go home and tell Mom
I'll be home in a few minutes.

2
00:01:23,032 --> 00:01:24,966
- Now, let's go up.
- All right.

3
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:30,896
Come on, fellas.

4
00:01:33,943 --> 00:01:37,310
All right, Eddie. I'll give you
the 50 cents when I change the buck.

5
00:01:43,887 --> 00:01:45,650
Sixty dames.

6
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,350
Come on, Nick, what do you say?

7
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,891
Come on, Nick, what do you say?

8
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,755
Hello, boys.

9
00:01:52,929 --> 00:01:55,921
Hello. How's the old woman?
Glad to see you.

10
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:57,657
- Come on in, Joe.
- Glad to be here.

11
00:01:57,834 --> 00:02:00,598
Yeah, sure. Have a good one.

12
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,597
- What did you do that for?
- Why, I'll give it to you.

13
00:02:03,773 --> 00:02:06,207
- Hey, Cliff.
- Well, what are you gonna have?

14
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:10,506
- Beer, and hurry it up.
- Right. Come on with that beer.

15
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:21,489
Hey, where's Lily?

16
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:24,456
Oh, I'll find her. Oh, Lily.

17
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:34,100
Where is she?

18
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,602
- Where'd she go?
- I don't know.

19
00:02:36,773 --> 00:02:39,606
Now look what you went and done.
You're fired.

20
00:02:39,776 --> 00:02:42,142
- You lazy, thieving little son of a...
- Hey.

21
00:02:42,478 --> 00:02:44,605
- Easy with the whip.
- You keep out of this.

22
00:02:44,781 --> 00:02:47,011
- Go on, get out of my house.
- Lf Chico goes, I go.

23
00:02:47,183 --> 00:02:48,275
- What?
- You heard me.

24
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:50,976
Don't you talk to me that way.
I'm your father!

25
00:02:51,154 --> 00:02:52,678
- That's my tough luck.
- Listen...

26
00:02:52,856 --> 00:02:56,815
Now get this.
If I stay here, Chico stays too.

27
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:07,866
Take some beer out to the boys,
will you, Lily?

28
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,337
Clean that up, Chico.

29
00:03:16,145 --> 00:03:18,841
- Here's Lily!
- Lily, how are you?

30
00:03:19,015 --> 00:03:21,506
- Hello, Lily.
- Thattagirl.

31
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:23,242
What's your hurry?

32
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:26,616
- Some beer here, Lily.
- Ain't that funny?

33
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:32,987
- Come here, sweetheart.
- Oh, lay off, you big ape.

34
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:37,527
Over here, honey. Give me a bottle
of that stuff, will you? I missed you.

35
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,227
- Yeah?
- Put a head on this, will you?

36
00:03:41,871 --> 00:03:44,931
A couple of glasses.
Here's looking, Lily.

37
00:03:59,422 --> 00:04:01,481
How's things, baby?

38
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:05,891
Let's me and you take a little walk
over by the quarry, huh?

39
00:04:06,062 --> 00:04:07,962
Come on in, Cragg.

40
00:04:09,532 --> 00:04:13,593
- Hey, cobbler, when do I get my shoes?
- When you pay for them.

41
00:04:15,305 --> 00:04:18,570
- What do you say, do we take a walk?
- I can hardly wait.

42
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:22,439
- Hello, Mr. Cragg.
- Sit down.

43
00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:24,477
- Beer?
- Yeah.

44
00:04:24,647 --> 00:04:26,877
You ain't been in lately.

45
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,610
I don't care for the crowd here.

46
00:04:29,786 --> 00:04:31,549
No.

47
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:33,951
They're pretty mangy.

48
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:37,525
How long are you going to stand it?

49
00:04:38,094 --> 00:04:40,324
Why don't you get out
before it is too late?

50
00:04:40,496 --> 00:04:43,158
- Where would I go?
- Out into the world.

51
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,632
You could make something of yourself.
You have power.

52
00:04:46,803 --> 00:04:50,864
Yeah. I'm a ball of fire, I am.

53
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:54,938
You don't realize your potentialities.

54
00:04:55,411 --> 00:04:56,605
Come again?

55
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:01,241
Did you read that book I gave you?

56
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:04,147
Oh, I tried to, but I didn't
understand it very good.

57
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,689
It's by Nietzsche,
the greatest philosopher of all time.

58
00:05:08,858 --> 00:05:13,158
Yeah. Well, I never did
get much good out of books.

59
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,591
You are a fool.

60
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:18,160
You could learn a lot
from that book.

61
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:21,599
But if you are content to stay here
like a dumb animal...

62
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:25,036
...in this miserable life,
then I wash my hands from you.

63
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:28,575
- Gee, Mr. Cragg, you ain't sore, are you?
- Here.

64
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,805
- For the beer.
- Oh, no, I couldn't take it. Not from you.

65
00:05:31,981 --> 00:05:34,040
No, no. I accept no favors.

66
00:05:34,217 --> 00:05:37,516
Oh, don't be like that.
You ain't like a customer.

67
00:05:37,687 --> 00:05:40,884
- Come in again tomorrow?
- Well...

68
00:05:41,057 --> 00:05:42,786
...we'll see.

69
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:48,789
- Did he pay you for it?
- Yeah, but I gave it back to him.

70
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:52,958
- Say, what do you think we're running here?
- It looks to me like a zoo.

71
00:05:55,538 --> 00:05:57,972
Four. Four and a quarter.

72
00:05:58,141 --> 00:06:01,633
Four-fifty, 4.75, 5.00.

73
00:06:04,247 --> 00:06:06,715
Another cup of coffee, honey?

74
00:06:12,688 --> 00:06:14,553
Hello.

75
00:06:14,924 --> 00:06:17,518
Well, Ed, I'm glad to see you.
Come on in.

76
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:20,787
- It's hot tonight.
- Yeah, yeah.

77
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:23,727
Just make yourself comfortable, Ed.

78
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:44,914
- Good night, Nick.
- Good night, boys.

79
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:47,318
- Good night, Joe.
- See you tomorrow.

80
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,617
Yeah, come back tomorrow.

81
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:52,152
I wanna talk to you.

82
00:06:52,361 --> 00:06:55,819
You fixed it with the big fella, didn't you?
They ain't gonna make no trouble?

83
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,558
Yeah, that ain't what I
wanna talk to you about.

84
00:07:04,607 --> 00:07:07,269
He's a big politician, ain't he?

85
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:11,544
He's a big something,
and it ain't a politician.

86
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:15,209
Honey, you makes me tickle.

87
00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:24,889
Chico, go downstairs
and watch the still while I'm out.

88
00:07:26,162 --> 00:07:28,926
Come on, hurry up! Get a move on you.

89
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:34,027
Come on, old-timer, come on.

90
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,569
- You and I are gonna take a walk.
- What's the matter?

91
00:07:36,739 --> 00:07:38,832
Come on. Up.

92
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:41,169
What's the matter?

93
00:07:44,614 --> 00:07:47,378
- What's the matter?
- That's all right. Come on.

94
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:58,549
- How are you, Lily?
- I was great up till now.

95
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:03,656
I don't often get to see you alone.

96
00:08:11,707 --> 00:08:16,576
Oh, excuse me. My hand shakes so
when I'm around you.

97
00:08:31,961 --> 00:08:34,327
You haul your freight out of here.

98
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,892
- What, you getting particular?
- Maybe I am.

99
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:42,595
- Did you ever take a good look at yourself?
- Yeah, you're exclusive, you are.

100
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,865
The sweetheart of the night shift.

101
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:48,101
Come on, you're wasting my time.
Everybody knows about you.

102
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,767
Yeah?

103
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,244
Well, you ain't going to.

104
00:09:33,022 --> 00:09:35,889
- Ed. What's the matter?
- No more protection for you.

105
00:09:36,058 --> 00:09:38,618
I'll see that the police
close up your joint.

106
00:09:49,472 --> 00:09:50,962
Lily!

107
00:09:52,908 --> 00:09:54,842
What did you do to him, huh?

108
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,808
Are you crazy?

109
00:09:56,979 --> 00:10:00,779
Ed Sipple's kept my place open. Now he's
going to the police, he's gonna close me up.

110
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,248
You done it! You never was any good.

111
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:05,512
Pulling a thing like this,
I ought to kill you.

112
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,452
- What's stopping you?
- I should've thrown you out years ago...

113
00:10:08,624 --> 00:10:11,821
...instead of raising you the way I did!
- Yeah, the way you did.

114
00:10:11,994 --> 00:10:14,963
- You're just like your mother!
- She was lucky to get away from you.

115
00:10:15,131 --> 00:10:16,860
Was she? Look what happened to her.

116
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,365
She's better dead than
living with a thing like you.

117
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,060
- And I'm getting out too.
- You little tramp, you!

118
00:10:22,238 --> 00:10:26,766
Yeah, I'm a tramp, and who's to blame?
My father. A swell start you gave me.

119
00:10:26,942 --> 00:10:31,106
Ever since I was 14, what's it been?
Nothing but men! Dirty, rotten men!

120
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,444
And you're lower than any of them!
I'll hate you as long as I live!

121
00:10:35,618 --> 00:10:38,052
Mr. Powers, there's something
wrong with the still.

122
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,711
It's smoking something awful.

123
00:10:47,763 --> 00:10:50,288
Can I do something for you, honey?

124
00:11:15,358 --> 00:11:17,519
Your father's in there!

125
00:11:35,411 --> 00:11:38,141
Poor Mr. Powers. What a terrible death.

126
00:11:38,314 --> 00:11:40,214
- Nick Powers?
- Yes.

127
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:12,870
Well, that's that.

128
00:12:14,183 --> 00:12:18,415
I never go to funerals.
A relic of barbarism.

129
00:12:18,587 --> 00:12:21,112
So now what?

130
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,917
Well, the future looks very bright.

131
00:12:23,092 --> 00:12:26,255
Just as I was leaving the cemetery,
Ed Sipple made me a proposition.

132
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:29,023
And the manager of the
Star and Garter Burlesque House...

133
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:31,564
...offered me a job in the chorus
to do a strip act.

134
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:34,703
- A strip act?
- Yeah, show my shape.

135
00:12:35,638 --> 00:12:38,471
Well, that's a business in itself.

136
00:12:38,641 --> 00:12:41,872
Oh, I guess I ain't much
of a businesswoman.

137
00:12:42,044 --> 00:12:45,946
What's going to become of you?
It's up to you to decide.

138
00:12:46,115 --> 00:12:48,140
If you stay in this town, you are lost.

139
00:12:48,884 --> 00:12:51,580
Where would I go, Paris?
I got 4 bucks.

140
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,980
That's what makes me mad with you.
You're a coward. I mean it.

141
00:12:56,158 --> 00:12:59,457
You let life defeat you.
You don't fight back.

142
00:12:59,628 --> 00:13:03,359
- What chance has a woman got?
- More chance than men.

143
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,466
A woman, young, beautiful like you...

144
00:13:05,634 --> 00:13:09,832
...can get anything she wants in the world
because you have power over men.

145
00:13:10,005 --> 00:13:13,463
But you must use men,
not let them use you.

146
00:13:13,642 --> 00:13:16,611
You must be a master, not a slave.

147
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:20,078
Look. Here. Nietzsche says:

148
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:23,514
''All life, no matter how we idealize it...

149
00:13:23,686 --> 00:13:27,417
...is nothing more, nor less,
than exploitation.''

150
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,915
That's what I'm telling you.

151
00:13:30,092 --> 00:13:31,525
Exploit yourself.

152
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:35,029
Go to some big city
where you will find opportunities.

153
00:13:35,197 --> 00:13:38,098
Use men. Be strong!

154
00:13:38,267 --> 00:13:41,031
Defiant! Use men...

155
00:13:41,203 --> 00:13:44,604
...to get the things you want!

156
00:13:51,981 --> 00:13:53,642
Yeah.

157
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:31,074
Hey, this is okay. Give me a match.

158
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,317
- It's awfully dark in here.
- Yeah.

159
00:14:35,758 --> 00:14:38,921
Well, the darker the better
till we pull out.

160
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:47,725
Well...

161
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,738
...the next station is New York.

162
00:15:04,453 --> 00:15:06,944
Hey, you. Come on out of there.

163
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:09,123
Come on.

164
00:15:11,427 --> 00:15:13,122
Well, I'm a...

165
00:15:13,295 --> 00:15:15,695
Too many of you dames getting
away with it these days.

166
00:15:15,864 --> 00:15:18,890
- The cops in the yards will take care of you.
- Oh, wait a minute.

167
00:15:19,068 --> 00:15:22,799
- You wouldn't throw us off, would you?
- Yeah, and you're gonna get 30 days for it.

168
00:15:22,972 --> 00:15:26,169
- In jail?
- Yes, in jail.

169
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:31,043
Now, why don't we sit down
and talk this thing over.

170
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,341
That lady's dressed up.

171
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:48,754
And look at her automobile.

172
00:16:50,025 --> 00:16:53,586
But what I wanna to find out is
how did she get them?

173
00:17:07,242 --> 00:17:09,472
I could use some of them pork chops.

174
00:17:09,645 --> 00:17:13,911
It's all in your mind.
You ate yesterday, didn't you?

175
00:17:40,008 --> 00:17:43,273
Boy, I'll bet there's plenty of dough
in this little shack.

176
00:17:57,593 --> 00:18:00,960
Say, I'd like to work in there.
Can you fix it for me?

177
00:18:06,368 --> 00:18:09,462
You might try the Personnel Department
around on 47th.

178
00:18:09,938 --> 00:18:11,929
Thanks so much.

179
00:18:12,107 --> 00:18:14,075
I'll be seeing you.

180
00:18:17,412 --> 00:18:21,280
- Get me a taxi.
- Yes, sir. Taxi!

181
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:32,953
- Is this where you ask for jobs?
- Yeah, this is where you ask for them.

182
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,791
Wait here.

183
00:18:49,978 --> 00:18:53,004
I have good references.
If I could only see him.

184
00:18:53,182 --> 00:18:56,777
You can wait if you want to,
but he is out to lunch.

185
00:19:02,758 --> 00:19:06,216
What part of the South
are you from, Mr. Pratt?

186
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:09,622
Tallapoosa, Georgia.

187
00:19:10,032 --> 00:19:12,364
I know some Pratts where I come from.

188
00:19:13,602 --> 00:19:14,830
Where was that?

189
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,703
Oh, maybe I'll tell you someday
when I know you better.

190
00:19:19,474 --> 00:19:21,908
- Say, I like it here. How about a job?
- Oh, we don't...

191
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:25,877
Oh, now, don't tell me in this great big
building there ain't some place for me.

192
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:30,717
Have you had any experience?

193
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,212
Plenty.

194
00:19:36,225 --> 00:19:37,954
I'd rather wait in there.

195
00:19:38,126 --> 00:19:39,559
I hate crowds.

196
00:19:40,963 --> 00:19:42,828
Don't you?

197
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:47,063
The boss won't be back for an hour.

198
00:19:47,703 --> 00:19:51,161
Well, then why don't we go in
and talk this over.

199
00:20:35,217 --> 00:20:38,084
- Is that a permanent?
- Yeah, they do it for 3.35...

200
00:20:38,253 --> 00:20:39,811
...at Boin's Beauty Shop.

201
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:43,549
- Where's that at?
- 81 st and Broadway.

202
00:20:55,437 --> 00:20:58,634
- See that this gets off at once.
- Yes, sir.

203
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:02,038
- Thought any more about that girl?
- No.

204
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,507
Mr. Brody, she's smart and...

205
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,648
I told you once, I don't need
any more girls in my department.

206
00:21:06,815 --> 00:21:08,749
- Seventy-nine.
- Seventy-nine.

207
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:10,885
One twenty-one.

208
00:21:11,753 --> 00:21:12,981
One twenty-one.

209
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,454
One twenty-two.

210
00:21:17,626 --> 00:21:19,116
I'll be right back.

211
00:21:21,263 --> 00:21:24,323
Oh, Mr. McCoy, those papers
will be ready in 10 minutes.

212
00:21:24,499 --> 00:21:26,228
Oh, thanks very much.

213
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:36,109
- Who's that girl?
- That's the girl I've been telling you about.

214
00:21:36,945 --> 00:21:39,277
- One twenty-two.
- One thirty.

215
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:40,676
One thirty.

216
00:21:40,983 --> 00:21:43,577
- Two hundred and fifty-two.
- Well...

217
00:21:43,752 --> 00:21:45,219
...maybe I could use her.

218
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,287
Well, Mr. Brody, she's very intelligent.

219
00:21:47,456 --> 00:21:50,084
She's head and shoulders above
any other girl in the place.

220
00:21:50,258 --> 00:21:51,885
That so?

221
00:22:15,217 --> 00:22:18,778
- Hey, sign this, will you?
- Hello, stupid.

222
00:22:18,954 --> 00:22:21,354
- Are you married?
- No, and I know the next answer:

223
00:22:21,523 --> 00:22:25,084
I don't live with my folks. Someday
that signature will be worth money.

224
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,889
Yeah, they laughed when
I sat down to play the piano.

225
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:42,243
This is the Benson mortgage.
Will you look it over now?

226
00:22:42,411 --> 00:22:44,743
Is the insurance clause here?

227
00:22:46,748 --> 00:22:49,740
Everything's incorporated in it.

228
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,988
Stick around after 5.

229
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:01,325
Yes, this is a very serious case.
I'm afraid we'll have to foreclose.

230
00:23:02,164 --> 00:23:06,225
Look at that, will you? Sickening,
the way those two carry on.

231
00:23:06,401 --> 00:23:08,562
You'd never think he had
a wife and three kids.

232
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:12,337
Oh, hello, Jimmy.

233
00:23:12,507 --> 00:23:14,873
Listen, Baby Face,
how about having dinner tonight?

234
00:23:15,043 --> 00:23:19,343
- I got two tickets for Vanities.
- Oh, I'd love to, but I can't tonight.

235
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,047
Well, I never see you anymore.

236
00:23:21,216 --> 00:23:24,652
I never see anybody anymore.
I'm working so hard.

237
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,912
- Gee, but l...
- I'm sorry.

238
00:23:26,088 --> 00:23:29,819
I have to go to bed early every night.
Excuse me, will you?

239
00:23:31,426 --> 00:23:34,259
You don't know you're out
till they stop counting.

240
00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:38,126
Wake up, kid. Baby Face is
moving out of your class.

241
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,919
Oh, not here. Somebody might...

242
00:24:31,419 --> 00:24:35,412
- Has Mr. Brody left yet?
- No, Mr. Stevens, I believe he's still here.

243
00:24:42,697 --> 00:24:44,392
Brody.

244
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:54,531
Brody!

245
00:24:58,713 --> 00:25:01,045
This is an outrage.
A man in your position.

246
00:25:01,216 --> 00:25:03,309
Get your check at once.

247
00:25:09,457 --> 00:25:11,254
Young woman!

248
00:25:20,969 --> 00:25:24,871
We have no place here for a girl
of your sort. You're through tonight.

249
00:25:25,507 --> 00:25:29,705
Why, Mr. Stevens, it wasn't my fault.
He followed me in there.

250
00:25:29,878 --> 00:25:34,110
What could I do? He's my boss,
and I have to earn my living.

251
00:25:38,987 --> 00:25:44,084
Oh, I'm so ashamed. It's the first time
anything like that has ever happened to me.

252
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,692
Well, I'll...

253
00:25:46,861 --> 00:25:49,261
I'll think it over.
Report tomorrow as usual.

254
00:25:49,431 --> 00:25:51,490
Oh, thank you, Mr. Stevens.

255
00:26:16,391 --> 00:26:18,552
Mr. Stevens' office.

256
00:26:18,727 --> 00:26:21,161
No, he ain't. I mean, isn't.

257
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,921
Thank you.

258
00:26:33,908 --> 00:26:35,899
- For Mr. Stevens.
- Oh, thanks.

259
00:26:39,547 --> 00:26:42,345
Do you think you'll be able to get off
in time to go shopping?

260
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:43,916
- I don't...
- I'll take this in.

261
00:26:44,085 --> 00:26:47,145
He has to sign this voucher anyhow.

262
00:26:48,757 --> 00:26:52,693
- Well, she certainly works fast.
- It won't do her any good.

263
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,386
He's very much in love
with the girl he's engaged to.

264
00:26:55,563 --> 00:26:57,827
Say, I was surprised to read
that in the paper.

265
00:26:57,999 --> 00:27:01,833
It's a good match for him too.
Marrying old Carter's daughter.

266
00:27:02,003 --> 00:27:04,665
Mr. Stevens is
an extraordinarily fine person.

267
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:08,798
He has high ideals.
He's not like other men.

268
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,956
- You can't come in.
- What do you mean?

269
00:27:31,132 --> 00:27:34,624
New landlady. And she's a terror.
Won't let me have any men visitors.

270
00:27:34,803 --> 00:27:37,966
- I've gotta see you. It's been over a week.
- No, it can't be done.

271
00:27:38,139 --> 00:27:42,075
But, Lily, losing my job was bad enough,
but not seeing you is worse. I can't stand it.

272
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,905
No, it's wrong. My conscience
has been bothering me.

273
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,843
- But you...
- Think of your wife and kids.

274
00:27:47,015 --> 00:27:49,347
I can't see you anymore.

275
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,651
Lily...

276
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:05,965
- Who was it, honey?
- Oh, just a boy collecting for the paper.

277
00:28:06,134 --> 00:28:08,830
- Have a drink?
- No, thanks. I never touch it.

278
00:28:09,003 --> 00:28:11,471
Oh, you don't want me to drink alone.

279
00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:12,970
Well...

280
00:28:13,141 --> 00:28:15,234
...maybe just a sip.

281
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,931
Hello? Tell Mr. Stevens that his fiancée
is upstairs with her father...

282
00:28:43,104 --> 00:28:44,901
...and she'll be right down to see him.

283
00:28:45,073 --> 00:28:46,734
Thank you.

284
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,881
Oh, Miss Merrick, I've changed my mind.

285
00:28:59,053 --> 00:29:02,352
Could you go to lunch now?
I'd like to get a manicure at 1:00.

286
00:29:02,524 --> 00:29:04,788
That's quite all right.

287
00:29:30,618 --> 00:29:33,451
Haven't I told you never to come
beyond the front of this desk?

288
00:29:33,621 --> 00:29:36,715
Oh, but I get so lonesome
out there all by myself.

289
00:29:36,891 --> 00:29:38,358
Now, don't do that.

290
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,585
How do you expect me
to get any work done?

291
00:29:40,762 --> 00:29:42,787
Hold me close.

292
00:30:07,489 --> 00:30:09,081
Anne.

293
00:30:09,257 --> 00:30:11,282
Anne, listen to me.

294
00:30:32,614 --> 00:30:36,106
Paragraph. It has always been
the policy of this institution...

295
00:30:36,284 --> 00:30:38,650
...to appoint its customers...
- Father!

296
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,811
My darling. What is it?

297
00:30:40,989 --> 00:30:42,320
What is it?

298
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:44,685
Anne, please, dear.

299
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:48,989
What? Tell me.
Tell me what happened.

300
00:30:49,163 --> 00:30:51,290
- Anne, please.
- There's nothing he can say.

301
00:30:51,499 --> 00:30:53,160
I don't wanna see him.

302
00:30:53,334 --> 00:30:54,767
- What happened, Ned?
- Why, l...

303
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:58,064
Send him away, please. I can't.

304
00:30:58,239 --> 00:30:59,900
Perhaps you'd better wait outside.

305
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:37,402
There seems to be only one thing
to do, Ned. Let that girl go.

306
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,953
- Is that all to go out?
- Listen to this, will you:

307
00:31:47,121 --> 00:31:48,782
''When guests enter the dining room...

308
00:31:48,957 --> 00:31:52,916
...it is customary for the butler to hold out
the chair of the mistress of the house.

309
00:31:53,094 --> 00:31:56,291
If there are footmen enough,
the chair of each lady is held for her.''

310
00:31:56,464 --> 00:31:59,058
See that you don't forget that now.

311
00:32:00,735 --> 00:32:02,794
Come in a minute, please.

312
00:32:14,816 --> 00:32:16,340
Lily...

313
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,508
...it's too bad that happened.

314
00:32:18,953 --> 00:32:21,922
L... I'll have to let you go.

315
00:32:22,757 --> 00:32:24,520
Yes.

316
00:32:25,793 --> 00:32:27,818
Well, I have no choice.

317
00:32:27,996 --> 00:32:29,156
You understand.

318
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:37,501
Anyway, it's better this way.
I'd rather you don't work.

319
00:32:42,343 --> 00:32:44,607
I don't wanna quit the job.

320
00:32:44,779 --> 00:32:47,145
I like to be near you.

321
00:32:47,915 --> 00:32:50,281
I don't see you much as it is.

322
00:32:50,451 --> 00:32:52,248
Well, I'm sorry, Lily.

323
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,820
There's nothing else for me to do.

324
00:32:55,189 --> 00:32:57,316
You can't stay here.

325
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,552
All right.

326
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:03,492
If I have to go, it means
that you won't see me anymore.

327
00:33:03,665 --> 00:33:05,530
- Look here.
- No, that's all there is to it.

328
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,727
If you fire me, we're through.
It isn't the job, I don't mind that.

329
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:12,429
But it just goes to show me
how much you care.

330
00:33:12,607 --> 00:33:14,939
- Well, you know how much l...
- How much you what?

331
00:33:22,316 --> 00:33:24,716
Are you letting me go?

332
00:33:37,131 --> 00:33:39,531
Ned, you can't do this thing.

333
00:33:39,701 --> 00:33:42,363
I don't want to hand your resignation
to the board.

334
00:33:42,537 --> 00:33:46,098
I'm sorry, Mr. Carter,
but I can't discharge the girl.

335
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:49,107
- I know it's difficult, but now, look here...
- It's no use.

336
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,609
I know what you're going to say,
but I can't help it.

337
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,679
I'm willing to take the consequences.

338
00:33:53,848 --> 00:33:56,442
I know it means my job.
And Anne will break our engagement.

339
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:58,710
Now, now, take it easy.

340
00:33:58,886 --> 00:34:01,980
This needn't be the end of the world.

341
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,087
Naturally, you're upset.

342
00:34:04,258 --> 00:34:07,489
But after all,
you and I understand each other.

343
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:10,430
Suppose you let me handle this thing.

344
00:34:10,598 --> 00:34:12,065
What you need is a little change.

345
00:34:12,233 --> 00:34:15,794
A few days at White Sulphur.
Or even at Atlantic City.

346
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,632
That'll give you time to think things over.

347
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,707
Meantime, leave everything to me.

348
00:34:21,876 --> 00:34:24,367
What do you say, huh?

349
00:34:27,548 --> 00:34:29,311
- Thanks a lot.
- Yeah.

350
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:38,249
Yes?

351
00:34:38,426 --> 00:34:40,155
Thank you.

352
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:43,789
Mr. Carter would like to see you
right away.

353
00:34:44,031 --> 00:34:45,658
Me?

354
00:35:02,416 --> 00:35:06,546
I won't waste words with you.
This is a very serious matter.

355
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:10,620
Of course, you realize that Mr. Stevens
is engaged to my daughter?

356
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:12,817
Engaged?

357
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,560
Why, I had no idea.

358
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:17,425
Oh, it can't be true.

359
00:35:17,598 --> 00:35:20,465
You mean, you didn't know
he was to be married?

360
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:24,463
Oh, no. He told me I was the only one.

361
00:35:25,173 --> 00:35:27,573
My daughter is heartbroken.

362
00:35:27,742 --> 00:35:29,505
But what about me?

363
00:35:31,579 --> 00:35:35,015
You're not asking me
to give him up, are you?

364
00:35:37,451 --> 00:35:39,817
Oh, how could I?

365
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:45,616
Did he mean so much to you?

366
00:35:46,661 --> 00:35:48,629
Everything in the world.

367
00:35:50,932 --> 00:35:54,595
Was he your first sweetheart?

368
00:35:57,038 --> 00:35:59,666
This is very distressing.

369
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,839
I'm sure you must see
how impossible it would be...

370
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:04,875
...for you to remain at the bank.

371
00:36:05,046 --> 00:36:07,241
But what will I do?

372
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,851
- Have you no family in New York?
- No, I'm all alone here.

373
00:36:11,018 --> 00:36:14,476
I haven't any friends
and I haven't any money.

374
00:36:14,956 --> 00:36:17,686
I shall have to think this over.

375
00:36:27,068 --> 00:36:28,626
Will you tell me where you live?

376
00:36:29,237 --> 00:36:32,297
My telephone number is Schuyler 3-2215.

377
00:36:43,484 --> 00:36:45,714
- Miss Powers?
- Yes, sir. Come right in.

378
00:36:45,887 --> 00:36:47,252
Thank you.

379
00:37:22,556 --> 00:37:25,821
- Good morning.
- Oh, good morning.

380
00:37:54,288 --> 00:37:57,587
- Is these new furs, honey?
- Not so much ''honey.''

381
00:37:57,758 --> 00:37:59,851
Yes, ma'am.

382
00:38:08,302 --> 00:38:11,100
Oh, before I forget it,
Mr. Carter called up.

383
00:38:11,272 --> 00:38:14,139
- He's coming up for dinner.
- Yeah?

384
00:38:14,342 --> 00:38:17,106
Give the old boy Irish stew.

385
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:26,486
Oh, Hodges, we'll have coffee
and liqueurs in here.

386
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:31,152
Did Fuzzy-Wuzzy enjoy his dinner?

387
00:38:34,195 --> 00:38:36,720
Oh, you're just too marvelous.

388
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:46,100
Okay, Hodges.
Does my baby want brandy?

389
00:38:46,273 --> 00:38:48,207
Anything you say.

390
00:38:54,949 --> 00:38:58,112
- Aren't you gonna have some?
- Oh, no. I never drink.

391
00:38:58,285 --> 00:38:59,809
Oh, come on.

392
00:38:59,987 --> 00:39:03,514
Well, maybe just a sip of yours.

393
00:39:10,898 --> 00:39:12,661
Isn't this cozy?

394
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:16,826
You know, sometimes your little girl
gets awful lonesome here all by herself.

395
00:39:17,004 --> 00:39:18,869
Oh, my dear.

396
00:39:21,642 --> 00:39:24,304
I wish you'd get rid of
that fantastic colored girl.

397
00:39:24,478 --> 00:39:28,141
- No, Chico stays.
- All right, all right, all right.

398
00:39:28,315 --> 00:39:30,909
How would you like to have
a nice grand piano in this room?

399
00:39:31,085 --> 00:39:34,020
Thanks, no pianos.
I used to hear one all day long.

400
00:39:34,188 --> 00:39:36,418
Why, did somebody in your home
play the piano?

401
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:39,115
Anybody that had a nickel.

402
00:39:40,161 --> 00:39:42,595
Oh, I was only kidding.

403
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:47,062
Of course, if Fuzzy-Wuzzy
really wants to give me something...

404
00:39:47,234 --> 00:39:50,260
...he could put a few more pennies
in my bank account.

405
00:39:50,438 --> 00:39:54,568
My dear, ask me something difficult.

406
00:39:56,343 --> 00:39:58,834
So nice seeing you back at work again.

407
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,111
Bye, darling.

408
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:47,088
Schuyler 3-2215.

409
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,260
Miss Powers' apartment, please.

410
00:40:52,766 --> 00:40:54,131
What?

411
00:40:54,301 --> 00:40:57,099
I'm calling Miss Lily Powers' apartment.

412
00:40:58,272 --> 00:41:00,206
Well, how long ago?

413
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,236
Two weeks?

414
00:41:02,576 --> 00:41:06,068
Well, she must have left
a forwarding address.

415
00:41:29,436 --> 00:41:32,496
- Merry Christmas, Miss Powers.
- Thanks.

416
00:41:32,673 --> 00:41:34,300
Merry Christmas to you.

417
00:41:34,475 --> 00:41:37,911
Oh, thank you. Aren't you going out
for Christmas dinner?

418
00:41:39,213 --> 00:41:40,840
No.

419
00:41:51,959 --> 00:41:54,223
You shouldn't have gave
the servants the day off.

420
00:41:54,395 --> 00:41:56,863
- I hate to leave you all alone.
- Oh, I don't mind.

421
00:41:57,031 --> 00:41:59,625
Oh, before I forget, Mr. Carter,
he telephoned.

422
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,826
Said he'd come in this evening
if he could get away from his family.

423
00:42:03,003 --> 00:42:05,233
That'll be just dandy.

424
00:42:05,406 --> 00:42:08,898
- What's this?
- Oh, that? It come while you was out.

425
00:42:09,076 --> 00:42:12,307
It's some books from old Mr. Cragg
back in Erie.

426
00:42:12,479 --> 00:42:15,448
- You run along and have a good time.
- I sliced some turkey for you.

427
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:18,585
- It's in the icebox.
- Thanks very much.

428
00:42:52,019 --> 00:42:53,816
Well.

429
00:42:54,188 --> 00:42:56,213
Merry Christmas.

430
00:42:56,757 --> 00:42:59,248
I had a terrible time finding you.

431
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,859
- Why didn't you leave word?
- Wait a minute.

432
00:43:02,029 --> 00:43:06,056
You're kind of mixed up, aren't you?
I thought you left town.

433
00:43:06,233 --> 00:43:08,463
Well, what else could I do?

434
00:43:08,636 --> 00:43:09,864
- I was in a...
- Jam?

435
00:43:10,037 --> 00:43:13,734
Well, I won't let you get in another.
See what I mean?

436
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:18,644
Lily, don't do this to me.
I can't stand it.

437
00:43:18,812 --> 00:43:21,144
- It's been brutal not seeing you.
- Yeah?

438
00:43:21,315 --> 00:43:23,476
Well, you better get used to it.

439
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:31,123
Listen, I don't owe you a thing.
Whatever I do is my own business.

440
00:43:31,292 --> 00:43:34,659
You never had but one idea about me.
That's all I ever meant to you.

441
00:43:34,895 --> 00:43:36,192
- Lily...
- You made your choice.

442
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,388
Now what do you want?

443
00:43:39,233 --> 00:43:40,825
You mean...

444
00:43:41,101 --> 00:43:44,764
...I can't see you anymore?
- How did you guess it?

445
00:43:46,106 --> 00:43:48,836
I'm sorry my butler's off today.

446
00:43:49,009 --> 00:43:52,445
I like to have my guests
shown out in style.

447
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:10,621
But, Ned, I have a right to know.

448
00:44:10,798 --> 00:44:13,266
You haven't been to see Anne
since Christmas.

449
00:44:13,434 --> 00:44:16,301
And it's obvious to everyone
that you're neglecting your work.

450
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:19,098
- Now, what's the matter?
- I'll tell you. Why not?

451
00:44:19,273 --> 00:44:21,969
I can't get along without her.
She's on my mind all the time.

452
00:44:22,142 --> 00:44:24,042
- Who do you mean?
- I mean, the girl.

453
00:44:24,211 --> 00:44:25,439
I saw her Christmas Day.

454
00:44:25,612 --> 00:44:28,274
It's my fault what's happened!
I can't stand the thought!

455
00:44:28,449 --> 00:44:30,576
Some man is keeping her!

456
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,315
But are you sure of that?

457
00:44:33,487 --> 00:44:35,955
Feeling the way I do,
I have no right to see Anne again.

458
00:44:36,123 --> 00:44:39,615
That means I'm through here at the bank.
All right, that's all there is to it.

459
00:44:58,645 --> 00:45:02,308
It's the sweetest New Year's present
I ever got.

460
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:07,845
Sit down. I like to look at you.

461
00:45:11,759 --> 00:45:14,660
I'm sorry, Miss Powers is not at home.

462
00:45:15,162 --> 00:45:17,323
I told you Miss Powers is not at home.

463
00:45:17,498 --> 00:45:21,025
- I know she's here.
- I say, look here! Where are you going?

464
00:45:22,236 --> 00:45:23,828
What's that?

465
00:45:28,442 --> 00:45:30,910
- What do you want?
- I want you to come with me.

466
00:45:31,078 --> 00:45:33,342
- Now. We're going to be married.
- You're drunk.

467
00:45:33,514 --> 00:45:37,041
I know what I'm doing. It's the only way.
I can't go on without you!

468
00:45:37,217 --> 00:45:39,811
So you wanna marry me, huh?

469
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,045
Isn't that beautiful.

470
00:45:42,222 --> 00:45:44,247
- Get out of here or...
- You've got to marry me!

471
00:45:44,425 --> 00:45:46,086
If you don't, I'll kill myself.

472
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:50,720
- Stop acting.
- No, I mean it! So help me, I'll kill myself!

473
00:45:55,803 --> 00:45:58,465
I told you to get out of here.

474
00:46:05,145 --> 00:46:06,373
Why, you...

475
00:47:24,558 --> 00:47:27,049
There's been an accident here.

476
00:47:27,494 --> 00:47:29,860
You'd better call the police.

477
00:48:01,495 --> 00:48:05,522
I tell you, gentlemen,
not in my 50 years of banking...

478
00:48:05,699 --> 00:48:08,896
...has this institution been implicated
in such a scandal.

479
00:48:09,069 --> 00:48:13,096
So with a scandal on top of us
and a blast of dangerous notoriety...

480
00:48:13,273 --> 00:48:16,572
...that's shaken the people's confidence
in our bank, what do you do?

481
00:48:16,743 --> 00:48:19,041
You demand the president's resignation...

482
00:48:19,212 --> 00:48:21,510
...and break your necks
to elect a new president.

483
00:48:21,682 --> 00:48:26,085
A playboy who hasn't had
a day's banking experience in his life.

484
00:48:26,253 --> 00:48:30,349
How do you expect a society globetrotter
to restore confidence?

485
00:48:30,524 --> 00:48:33,687
Perhaps you've forgotten
that his grandfather founded this bank.

486
00:48:34,027 --> 00:48:37,292
In this emergency, the Trenholm name
is the greatest asset we could have.

487
00:48:37,464 --> 00:48:40,262
Excuse me, sir. Mr. Trenholm is here.

488
00:48:42,636 --> 00:48:44,399
He's on his way in, gentlemen.

489
00:48:44,571 --> 00:48:46,869
And I needn't remind you
how essential it is...

490
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,237
...that we give him our undivided loyalty
and support.

491
00:48:51,979 --> 00:48:53,207
Good morning.

492
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:56,872
- I hope I haven't kept you waiting.
- Mr. Trenholm, my congratulations.

493
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:58,540
- Thank you, sir.
- Well, Courtland.

494
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:00,619
I'm delighted to see you,
Mr. Vanderleur.

495
00:49:00,787 --> 00:49:03,381
Your grandfather would have been
proud to see you here.

496
00:49:03,557 --> 00:49:04,922
That's very kind of you, sir.

497
00:49:05,092 --> 00:49:06,957
- Morning, Courtland.
- Hello, Jameson.

498
00:49:07,127 --> 00:49:08,651
- Well.
- Good morning.

499
00:49:08,829 --> 00:49:11,093
Well, I'm glad to see you,
Mr. Gault. I...

500
00:49:11,264 --> 00:49:13,789
Gentlemen, I shan't take up your time...

501
00:49:13,967 --> 00:49:16,367
...telling you how much
I appreciate this honor.

502
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:21,334
Some of you probably thing I should stick
to polo and not try to run a bank.

503
00:49:21,508 --> 00:49:24,602
But I'm sure that with your help,
I can't go very far wrong.

504
00:49:42,095 --> 00:49:44,154
Gentlemen, the first thing
we have to decide...

505
00:49:44,331 --> 00:49:46,629
...is what we're going to do
about this Lily Powers.

506
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,030
The Record has offered her
$ 10,000 for her story.

507
00:49:49,202 --> 00:49:52,000
That must be stopped.
The thing to do is to send for the girl.

508
00:49:52,172 --> 00:49:55,664
I told her to be here at 10:00.

509
00:50:01,982 --> 00:50:03,449
Quite on time.

510
00:50:03,617 --> 00:50:05,141
Come in.

511
00:50:10,357 --> 00:50:12,484
- Sit here, please.
- Thank you.

512
00:50:12,659 --> 00:50:15,628
Now, Courtland, will you?

513
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:21,060
Miss Powers, we understand
that one of the newspapers...

514
00:50:21,234 --> 00:50:24,260
...has offered you a sum of money
for a story by you...

515
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:27,168
...touching on this unfortunate affair.

516
00:50:27,507 --> 00:50:29,839
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

517
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:33,036
May I ask what sort of a story it is?

518
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,339
Why, it's my diary.

519
00:50:36,416 --> 00:50:37,644
You kept a diary?

520
00:50:37,884 --> 00:50:41,547
Well, just my experiences
here at the bank.

521
00:50:41,722 --> 00:50:42,984
I see.

522
00:50:43,557 --> 00:50:45,388
And you're willing
to have them published?

523
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:48,357
Oh, I couldn't bear to do it
except that I'm desperate.

524
00:50:48,528 --> 00:50:49,961
I know what the world thinks.

525
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:53,497
Everyone blames me.
No one knows the truth.

526
00:50:53,667 --> 00:50:56,295
I was all alone here.
No family, no friends.

527
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:59,530
I was working hard,
earning my own living.

528
00:50:59,706 --> 00:51:01,367
And then...

529
00:51:01,575 --> 00:51:04,442
- And then Baby came.
- Baby?

530
00:51:05,445 --> 00:51:07,743
That's what I always called Mr. Carter.

531
00:51:12,953 --> 00:51:16,286
I was a victim of circumstance.
No one will ever know what I went through.

532
00:51:16,456 --> 00:51:19,721
And then this terrible thing.
I couldn't believe it had happened.

533
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:22,223
Now I'm disgraced
for the rest of my life.

534
00:51:22,395 --> 00:51:24,659
There's nothing left for me
to do but to go away...

535
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:27,823
...where nobody knows me
and try and start all over again.

536
00:51:28,935 --> 00:51:31,028
I don't wanna sell this story
to the papers.

537
00:51:31,204 --> 00:51:32,865
I wouldn't hurt anyone for the world.

538
00:51:33,373 --> 00:51:36,774
I wish I could tear it up now
before anybody reads it, but I can't.

539
00:51:36,943 --> 00:51:39,241
I must have money to go away.

540
00:51:39,746 --> 00:51:43,614
All I want is a chance
to earn an honest living.

541
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:49,577
Gentlemen, I think
there's only one thing to do:

542
00:51:49,756 --> 00:51:53,658
Give Miss Powers a check for $ 10,000
to turn her story over to us.

543
00:51:53,827 --> 00:51:55,317
Oh, it's 15,000.

544
00:51:55,495 --> 00:51:58,259
Oh, didn't the paper offer you 10?

545
00:51:58,498 --> 00:52:00,625
Yes, but I've been figuring things up...

546
00:52:00,801 --> 00:52:04,066
...and I don't see how I could possibly
let it go for less than 15,000.

547
00:52:04,237 --> 00:52:06,967
Well, we won't quibble
over a few thousand dollars.

548
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:08,869
Are we all agreed, gentlemen?

549
00:52:09,276 --> 00:52:10,834
- I agree.
- That's the thing to do.

550
00:52:11,011 --> 00:52:14,344
- Then we're agreed on that.
- Just a moment, please.

551
00:52:15,448 --> 00:52:18,940
Miss Powers, no one could help
but be moved by your story.

552
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:22,646
It's obvious, as you say,
that you were a victim of circumstance.

553
00:52:22,823 --> 00:52:24,723
You have our sympathy.

554
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:29,385
Of course, any talk of money must be
very distressing to a sensitive person.

555
00:52:29,663 --> 00:52:34,430
You've told us how distasteful it would be
for you to accept money from a paper.

556
00:52:34,601 --> 00:52:38,799
I'm afraid it would be equally distasteful
to accept money from the bank.

557
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:42,702
Perhaps we've been somewhat crude
in our suggestion.

558
00:52:44,444 --> 00:52:47,709
You also told us
how hard you had to work.

559
00:52:48,215 --> 00:52:52,618
When this thing happened,
were you working very hard?

560
00:52:52,786 --> 00:52:55,277
Yeah, but not at the bank.

561
00:52:56,356 --> 00:52:58,221
Oh, I see.

562
00:52:58,525 --> 00:53:02,757
You also told us that all you wanted
was a chance to earn an honest living.

563
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:07,389
To get away where nobody knew you
and where you could start life over again.

564
00:53:07,567 --> 00:53:09,831
That is what you said,
isn't it, Miss Powers?

565
00:53:10,837 --> 00:53:12,304
Yes, that's what I said.

566
00:53:12,739 --> 00:53:14,934
Very well, we'll give you what you want.

567
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:18,271
We'll pay your passage to Paris,
and when you arrive there...

568
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:21,676
...you'll find a position waiting for you
in our Paris branch.

569
00:53:21,848 --> 00:53:24,043
No doubt, you'll want
to change your name.

570
00:53:24,217 --> 00:53:27,209
That can all be arranged for you
in strict confidence.

571
00:53:27,387 --> 00:53:28,911
Is that satisfactory, Miss Powers?

572
00:53:31,057 --> 00:53:33,389
- I guess so.
- Splendid.

573
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,289
- Did you put all that down?
- Yes, sir.

574
00:53:35,595 --> 00:53:38,723
Arrange transportation for Miss Powers
on the first boat sailing.

575
00:53:38,899 --> 00:53:41,333
Well, I think that's all,
isn't it, gentlemen?

576
00:53:41,501 --> 00:53:43,628
Thank you, Miss Powers.

577
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:47,102
You'll like Paris.
It's delightful in the springtime.

578
00:53:48,775 --> 00:53:50,299
Yeah?

579
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,604
You think of everything, don't you?

580
00:54:24,611 --> 00:54:27,944
Of course, if I go to Berlin,
the food there is very fattening.

581
00:54:28,114 --> 00:54:30,605
Well, you could go to Carlsbad
afterward and reduce.

582
00:54:30,784 --> 00:54:33,082
The very thing!
Could you arrange it for me?

583
00:54:33,253 --> 00:54:35,847
I'll have the tickets sent to your hotel,
Mrs. Hemingway.

584
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:38,081
- Would you care to look this over?
- Thank you.

585
00:54:38,258 --> 00:54:39,748
You're welcome.

586
00:54:39,926 --> 00:54:42,451
Would you look after this, Miss Allen?

587
00:54:42,629 --> 00:54:47,123
- Changed your mind about dinner tonight?
- I'm still not hungry.

588
00:54:49,402 --> 00:54:52,838
- My boy, I think she's crazy about you.
- Oh, I don't get her at all.

589
00:54:53,006 --> 00:54:55,338
What does she do for a good time?
She never goes out.

590
00:54:55,508 --> 00:54:58,272
Come on, boys. Try and give
the appearance of working, anyhow.

591
00:54:58,445 --> 00:55:01,107
We've got to make a good impression
on Mr. Trenholm.

592
00:55:02,248 --> 00:55:05,911
Oh, dear, I'm so nervous. All this fuss
and excitement over Mr. Trenholm.

593
00:55:06,086 --> 00:55:08,577
I do hope he doesn't start firing people
right and left.

594
00:55:08,755 --> 00:55:10,985
The last time the president came...

595
00:55:18,832 --> 00:55:20,697
When do you think the loan
will be decided?

596
00:55:20,867 --> 00:55:22,494
Oh, possibly in about two days.

597
00:55:23,103 --> 00:55:27,301
Then I shall take myself to Nice
for a much needed rest.

598
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,339
Well.

599
00:55:36,349 --> 00:55:38,214
I didn't expect to find you here.

600
00:55:40,053 --> 00:55:43,648
- I know you didn't.
- Miss Allen has done very well.

601
00:55:43,823 --> 00:55:45,814
We've put her in charge
of our travel bureau.

602
00:55:45,992 --> 00:55:47,619
Really? I'm glad to hear it.

603
00:55:47,794 --> 00:55:50,957
Oh, by the way, this department
has increased its business...

604
00:55:51,131 --> 00:55:53,895
...over 40 percent
since the first of the year.

605
00:56:19,059 --> 00:56:20,390
- Going my way?
- No, thanks.

606
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:23,893
- Well, you don't know which is my way.
- Anyhow, I'm not going that way.

607
00:56:24,064 --> 00:56:26,294
Well, good night.

608
00:56:49,923 --> 00:56:51,151
How are you liking Paris?

609
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:54,816
Oh, it's very nice, except that you
can't get a taxi when it rains.

610
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:56,291
Could I drop you?

611
00:56:56,463 --> 00:56:59,762
- I'm afraid that would be too much trouble.
- No trouble.

612
00:56:59,933 --> 00:57:01,696
Thank you.

613
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:21,111
Frankly, I am surprised.

614
00:57:21,287 --> 00:57:22,777
Why?

615
00:57:22,956 --> 00:57:25,220
I didn't expect you to stick to the job.

616
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:28,490
That's why I stuck.

617
00:57:30,663 --> 00:57:35,657
One might imagine that you'd find
this business life rather dull.

618
00:57:35,835 --> 00:57:40,238
One might imagine that you know
practically nothing about me.

619
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:44,839
Still, it would have been easy for you
to come here to Paris...

620
00:57:45,011 --> 00:57:48,037
...and have a somewhat gayer time.

621
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:52,617
It would have been too easy.
That's what you expected me to do.

622
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:56,287
Does it annoy you to find out
that you're wrong about something?

623
00:57:56,456 --> 00:57:58,583
Or were you ever wrong before?

624
00:57:58,758 --> 00:58:03,161
Well, you must admit
that our first meeting was rather formal.

625
00:58:05,031 --> 00:58:07,499
Oh, this is as far as I go.

626
00:58:08,601 --> 00:58:10,091
So this is where you live, huh?

627
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:14,832
All the charm of the Old World
and the Old World plumbing.

628
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:22,605
I'm sure your apartment is attractive.

629
00:58:23,616 --> 00:58:26,449
I wouldn't want you to be disappointed.

630
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:31,220
- Thanks so much. Good night.
- Good night.

631
00:58:49,008 --> 00:58:51,806
Oh, it's one of those pink envelopes.
I knew it.

632
00:58:51,978 --> 00:58:54,879
These big executives always begin
cutting down the office force.

633
00:58:55,048 --> 00:58:58,313
Oh, I never thought
they'd let you go, though, dearie.

634
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:14,198
- Did they give you a week's notice?
- No.

635
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:17,432
Just a few hours.

636
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:10,018
- Darling!
- Oh, Aunt Julia.

637
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:12,020
We just few over from London.

638
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:14,250
I saw you dancing
with this ravishing creature.

639
01:00:14,427 --> 01:00:16,122
This is my aunt, Lady Montroyd.

640
01:00:16,296 --> 01:00:18,287
- How do you do, my dear?
- How do you do?

641
01:00:18,564 --> 01:00:21,226
- Courtland, old boy.
- Hello, Harry.

642
01:00:21,401 --> 01:00:23,665
Harry simply dragged me here
with the delusion...

643
01:00:23,836 --> 01:00:27,670
...that Miss Allen might dance with him.
- Do you know the Duke of Pom-plum?

644
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:31,606
Courtland always finds
the most devastating girls.

645
01:00:31,778 --> 01:00:34,338
But if you get bored,
you come along, join us later.

646
01:00:34,514 --> 01:00:36,209
Oh, that would be jolly.

647
01:00:36,616 --> 01:00:39,483
Well, if I don't see you later,
and I don't suppose I shall...

648
01:00:39,652 --> 01:00:42,712
...take me to lunch tomorrow, dear.
- I will, Aunt Julia. Good night.

649
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:44,823
Miss Allen, would you
honor me with a dance?

650
01:00:44,991 --> 01:00:47,323
- Take Harry with you.
- I've been looking forward to it.

651
01:00:47,493 --> 01:00:49,859
- Come along, you little man. Good night.
- Good night.

652
01:00:50,029 --> 01:00:52,862
- Good night.
- Good night.

653
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:57,433
Well, my evening's a social success.
Dukes and ladies.

654
01:00:57,603 --> 01:01:00,367
Don't tell me the king of Spain
is going to jump out of a pie.

655
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:02,167
You mustn't be snobbish.

656
01:01:02,342 --> 01:01:06,142
Beneath their rough exteriors,
they really have hearts of platinum.

657
01:01:07,013 --> 01:01:09,811
Are you really thinking
or just pretending to?

658
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:13,646
That's the nice part of being
with a mastermind...

659
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:16,345
...you do the thinking for both of us.

660
01:01:19,692 --> 01:01:22,024
Then you're coming to Deauville?

661
01:01:24,697 --> 01:01:26,164
Deauville's too crowded.

662
01:01:27,533 --> 01:01:29,524
How about Biarritz?

663
01:01:29,802 --> 01:01:33,260
- Not crowded enough.
- I'll tell you what.

664
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:35,737
Would you like to motor through
the chateau country?

665
01:01:35,908 --> 01:01:39,400
And see all those lovely
14th-century ceilings?

666
01:01:40,246 --> 01:01:41,645
You're hard to please.

667
01:01:42,482 --> 01:01:44,848
No, I'm not, really.

668
01:01:45,017 --> 01:01:46,484
Just a little disappointed.

669
01:01:46,986 --> 01:01:48,613
Disappointed?

670
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:51,655
- In what?
- You.

671
01:01:52,658 --> 01:01:56,253
- Why?
- Oh, I don't know.

672
01:01:56,429 --> 01:01:59,956
I was hoping you wouldn't be
like everybody else.

673
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:02,267
Silly of me, wasn't it?

674
01:02:03,169 --> 01:02:07,037
Well, I'm disappointed in myself.

675
01:02:10,443 --> 01:02:13,207
Because you're beginning to upset me.

676
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:36,191
Darling...

677
01:02:36,903 --> 01:02:39,201
...how long is this going on?

678
01:02:39,539 --> 01:02:40,767
Aren't you happy?

679
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:44,000
These have been the three
happiest days of my life, but...

680
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:45,940
But what?

681
01:02:46,879 --> 01:02:49,814
Well, I don't enjoy saying good night
to you every night...

682
01:02:49,982 --> 01:02:52,576
...outside the door of your stateroom.

683
01:02:53,286 --> 01:02:54,947
It's funny.

684
01:02:55,121 --> 01:02:58,386
- Well, what's funny about it?
- Oh, I was just thinking.

685
01:02:58,558 --> 01:03:01,994
There's not much difference being
on a yacht or on the Albany night boat.

686
01:03:02,161 --> 01:03:04,459
You fool, don't you realize
I'm in love with you?

687
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:07,030
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

688
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:11,034
I can't wait to get back to Paris
to buy you all the jewels in Cartier's.

689
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:14,696
To take you to the motor salons, where
you can pick out any car that you like.

690
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:17,672
I want to give you a house in Paris
and another in New York.

691
01:03:17,844 --> 01:03:20,836
There isn't anything in the world
I wouldn't give you.

692
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:25,378
- That isn't love.
- I'm mad about you, and you know it.

693
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:28,145
There's only one thing I want.

694
01:03:28,321 --> 01:03:29,845
Name it, and it's yours.

695
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:34,424
I'd like to have a ''Mrs.''
On my tombstone.

696
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:41,594
I never thought of marriage seriously.

697
01:03:41,767 --> 01:03:45,863
It needn't last forever.
You could divorce me in two weeks.

698
01:03:46,038 --> 01:03:48,939
- Yes, but l...
- Oh, it's all right.

699
01:03:49,108 --> 01:03:51,042
Forget about it.

700
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:54,004
I just thought I'd mention it.

701
01:03:56,315 --> 01:03:58,408
Are you going to miss me?

702
01:03:58,784 --> 01:04:00,615
What do you mean?

703
01:04:00,887 --> 01:04:03,117
I'm leaving in the morning.

704
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:20,595
Great Scott!

705
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:22,934
Did you see this?

706
01:04:25,077 --> 01:04:28,672
This is a fine mess
with the condition the bank's in.

707
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:37,086
Hello, hello. This is transatlantic operator
number 16 calling Élysées 6142, Paris.

708
01:04:37,256 --> 01:04:39,247
Hello, hello.

709
01:04:39,425 --> 01:04:42,360
Hello, hello. Monsieur Trenholm?

710
01:04:42,528 --> 01:04:46,794
Transatlantic operator
is calling you from New York.

711
01:04:47,867 --> 01:04:50,233
Go ahead, they are ready to talk.

712
01:04:51,237 --> 01:04:52,932
Yes?

713
01:04:53,539 --> 01:04:55,734
Oh, hello, Mr. Jameson.

714
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:01,670
What?

715
01:05:02,848 --> 01:05:04,839
Are you sure?

716
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:07,547
Yes.

717
01:05:08,187 --> 01:05:11,020
All right, I'll come immediately.

718
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:13,788
Yes, thank you.

719
01:05:17,196 --> 01:05:21,326
I'm sorry, dear, but we've got to go
right back to New York.

720
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,695
Is anything wrong?

721
01:05:24,704 --> 01:05:26,763
I'm afraid so.

722
01:05:27,106 --> 01:05:29,404
They want me at the bank.

723
01:06:11,150 --> 01:06:13,209
If you'd listened,
this wouldn't have happened.

724
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:15,479
Will you stop blaming Trenholm?

725
01:06:15,721 --> 01:06:17,586
- It isn't his fault.
- When a bank closes...

726
01:06:17,757 --> 01:06:19,748
...because of mismanagement,
who is to blame?

727
01:06:19,925 --> 01:06:21,392
All of us are to blame.

728
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:26,691
- You can't hold one person responsible.
- Rot! You'll see who's held responsible.

729
01:06:35,141 --> 01:06:36,403
Courtland.

730
01:06:36,575 --> 01:06:39,567
- Mr. Jameson.
- Well, Courtland.

731
01:06:46,018 --> 01:06:49,613
Hi, special extra here:
Trenholm indicted!

732
01:06:49,789 --> 01:06:51,757
Hi, paper here!

733
01:06:51,924 --> 01:06:53,448
Hi, special extra here!

734
01:06:53,626 --> 01:06:56,322
Read all about it.
Trenholm indicted!

735
01:06:56,495 --> 01:06:58,759
Hi, all about the big bank failure!

736
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:03,561
Hi, special extra here:
Trenholm indicted!

737
01:07:45,778 --> 01:07:49,680
- Hasn't Mr. Trenholm called yet?
- No.

738
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:54,578
Bring me that pigskin case on the bed.

739
01:08:02,561 --> 01:08:06,258
- Know what's in this bag?
- No.

740
01:08:11,737 --> 01:08:14,035
Half a million dollars.

741
01:08:15,107 --> 01:08:17,541
Someday I'll have the other half
that goes with it.

742
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:21,476
You sure will. You can get anything
you put your mind on.

743
01:08:45,604 --> 01:08:47,538
What's the matter?

744
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:49,398
The bank's gone.

745
01:08:49,575 --> 01:08:52,942
I've been indicted. They released me
on a half a million dollars' bail.

746
01:08:53,112 --> 01:08:54,943
Bail? But what can they do to you?

747
01:08:55,147 --> 01:08:59,049
Why, they're preparing another indictment.
I've got to fight it. It'll take money.

748
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:01,584
I've got to raise a million dollars tonight.

749
01:09:03,189 --> 01:09:05,214
You'll have to help me.

750
01:09:05,724 --> 01:09:07,988
I'll need everything I've given you...

751
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:10,788
...all your bonds and securities.

752
01:09:11,463 --> 01:09:13,795
You have everything here, haven't you?

753
01:09:15,534 --> 01:09:18,025
Well, haven't you?

754
01:09:20,372 --> 01:09:22,169
I...

755
01:09:26,345 --> 01:09:28,040
I can't do it.

756
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:30,378
What do you mean?

757
01:09:30,549 --> 01:09:33,040
Lily, you've got to stick with me.

758
01:09:33,219 --> 01:09:35,050
You're all I have left.

759
01:09:35,221 --> 01:09:37,553
Together we can fight this thing.

760
01:09:37,723 --> 01:09:39,281
You've got to help me.

761
01:09:40,726 --> 01:09:42,125
No, I...

762
01:09:42,761 --> 01:09:44,922
I can't do it.

763
01:09:45,097 --> 01:09:47,258
I have to think of myself.

764
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:50,027
I've gone through a lot
to get those things.

765
01:09:50,202 --> 01:09:54,298
My life has been bitter and hard.
I'm not like other women.

766
01:09:54,473 --> 01:09:57,670
All the gentleness and kindness in me
has been killed.

767
01:09:57,843 --> 01:10:00,971
All I've got are those things.
Without them, I'd be nothing.

768
01:10:01,146 --> 01:10:03,876
I'd have to go back to what I was.

769
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:06,045
No.

770
01:10:07,386 --> 01:10:09,684
I won't give them up.

771
01:10:18,030 --> 01:10:20,794
Chico, put those things back.

772
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:23,093
Pack your trunks again.

773
01:10:23,535 --> 01:10:25,662
We're sailing tonight.

774
01:10:26,906 --> 01:10:31,570
Send all my luggage to the French Line pier
and get down there as quickly as you can.

775
01:10:48,928 --> 01:10:51,453
I don't know, but thank you.

776
01:11:35,007 --> 01:11:38,738
I know you've known men before me.
Probably more than one.

777
01:11:38,911 --> 01:11:41,675
But I don't care.
It doesn't make any difference.

778
01:11:41,847 --> 01:11:45,146
I love you, and someday
I'm going to make you love me.

779
01:12:33,799 --> 01:12:36,097
Oh, stop that!

780
01:12:46,712 --> 01:12:48,680
Now, be careful.

781
01:13:03,028 --> 01:13:04,757
Thank you.

782
01:13:09,201 --> 01:13:12,932
- Is Mr. Trenholm still here?
- I think so, ma'am.

783
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:30,182
Courtland.

784
01:13:33,625 --> 01:13:35,559
Courtland!

785
01:13:39,932 --> 01:13:42,093
Courtland!

786
01:13:51,043 --> 01:13:52,635
You didn't find him, ma'am?

787
01:13:52,811 --> 01:13:55,143
- Maybe he's down in his office.
- Oh, take me there.

788
01:13:55,314 --> 01:13:58,249
Sometimes they work late, you know.

789
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:13,627
Courtland.

790
01:14:13,899 --> 01:14:16,129
Get a doctor, quick.

791
01:14:18,637 --> 01:14:20,764
Oh, darling.

792
01:14:22,574 --> 01:14:24,337
Darling, don't leave me.

793
01:14:25,344 --> 01:14:29,007
I'll do anything for you. Anything.

794
01:14:29,781 --> 01:14:32,614
Don't go away from me, please.

795
01:14:33,285 --> 01:14:35,776
Oh, I love you so much.

796
01:14:35,954 --> 01:14:38,081
I love you.

797
01:14:38,757 --> 01:14:42,022
I've never said that before to any man.

798
01:14:42,327 --> 01:14:44,887
I never knew what it meant.

799
01:14:45,464 --> 01:14:47,625
Oh, darling.

800
01:14:47,799 --> 01:14:50,700
You can have everything I've got.

801
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:53,394
I'd do anything for you. Anything.

802
01:14:57,643 --> 01:14:59,508
Oh, Courtland.

803
01:14:59,678 --> 01:15:04,775
Don't leave me, Courtland!
Oh, my God, don't leave me!

804
01:15:16,228 --> 01:15:17,855
We've done all we can, lady.

805
01:15:18,263 --> 01:15:19,821
He has a good chance.

806
01:15:27,339 --> 01:15:29,466
Your case slipped, lady.
You better pick it up.

807
01:15:33,412 --> 01:15:35,846
It doesn't matter now.
