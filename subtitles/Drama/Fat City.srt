1
03:48:53,075 --> 03:48:54,872
Hey, kid.

2
03:48:55,878 --> 03:48:57,243
Want to spar?

3
03:48:58,981 --> 03:49:00,471
You a pro?

4
03:49:00,549 --> 03:49:03,985
I used to be.
I'm a little out of shape now.

5
03:49:04,053 --> 03:49:07,955
Come on. I won't hit you hard.
Maybe we can just fool around.

6
03:49:08,024 --> 03:49:09,992
I'll teach you a few things.

7
03:49:11,260 --> 03:49:13,455
You'd better put this on.

8
03:49:31,213 --> 03:49:32,407
You look good.

9
03:49:36,519 --> 03:49:38,487
Ready?

10
03:49:38,554 --> 03:49:39,953
Bong.

11
03:49:51,567 --> 03:49:53,592
You all right?
Good.

12
03:50:30,439 --> 03:50:31,906
Hold it.

13
03:50:33,909 --> 03:50:36,070
- You all right?
- Yeah, I pulled a muscle.

14
03:50:36,145 --> 03:50:38,943
You okay?

15
03:50:39,014 --> 03:50:41,676
I should have warmed up better.

16
03:50:43,119 --> 03:50:45,383
I haven't fought
in a year and a half.

17
03:50:53,295 --> 03:50:54,592
What's your name?

18
03:50:56,098 --> 03:50:59,192
- Ernie Munger.
- How many bouts you had?

19
03:50:59,268 --> 03:51:02,260
- None.
- You've never been in the ring?

20
03:51:02,338 --> 03:51:06,138
No. I just came to the Y
to fool around a little.

21
03:51:06,208 --> 03:51:08,267
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

22
03:51:14,083 --> 03:51:16,483
- You've never been in the ring?
- No.

23
03:51:18,687 --> 03:51:20,814
Well...

24
03:51:20,890 --> 03:51:23,484
I think you've got it, kid.

25
03:51:23,559 --> 03:51:25,686
I ought to know
what I'm talking about.

26
03:51:25,761 --> 03:51:27,695
I fought Efram Soto.

27
03:51:29,798 --> 03:51:33,325
There was a time
when nobody could hit me.

28
03:51:33,402 --> 03:51:36,462
They'd try, but I wouldn't be there.

29
03:51:37,706 --> 03:51:41,301
- You ought to start fighting.
- No, I just come to fool around.

30
03:51:43,546 --> 03:51:45,411
Listen...

31
03:51:45,481 --> 03:51:47,415
don't waste your good years.

32
03:51:48,751 --> 03:51:51,015
You know, you ought to go over
to the Lido Gym...

33
03:51:51,086 --> 03:51:53,020
and see my manager, Ruben Luna.

34
03:51:53,088 --> 03:51:55,056
Tell him I sent you... Billy Tully.

35
03:51:55,124 --> 03:51:57,251
- I saw you fight once.
- Yeah?

36
03:51:57,326 --> 03:52:00,318
- Did I win?
- No.

37
03:52:49,278 --> 03:52:51,246
Don't you ever go home?

38
03:52:52,448 --> 03:52:54,382
I just got here.

39
03:52:59,622 --> 03:53:03,353
What's keeping him?
He can see we're sitting here.

40
03:53:03,425 --> 03:53:07,623
- Can't you get him to serve us?
- Just take it easy. He'll be here.

41
03:53:07,696 --> 03:53:11,792
You spineless son of a bitch.
You'd take anybody against me.

42
03:53:11,867 --> 03:53:13,892
I want a cream sherry.

43
03:53:16,405 --> 03:53:19,272
Earl and me got something
very wonderful together.

44
03:53:19,341 --> 03:53:22,970
I love that man more than
any man's got a right to be loved.

45
03:53:23,045 --> 03:53:26,811
If he left me, I couldn't make it.
I couldn't live without him.

46
03:53:26,882 --> 03:53:30,340
Do you think he'd even raise his voice
and get me a drink? No.

47
03:53:30,419 --> 03:53:33,013
He'll just sit there
and let them ignore us.

48
03:53:33,088 --> 03:53:35,852
- Here he comes.
- Yeah, no thanks to you.

49
03:53:38,093 --> 03:53:39,651
Two sherries.

50
03:53:41,563 --> 03:53:43,497
I pulled a muscle.

51
03:53:44,800 --> 03:53:47,394
I make up my mind
to go back into training...

52
03:53:47,469 --> 03:53:49,699
I hardly get the gloves on...

53
03:53:49,772 --> 03:53:51,865
I pull a muscle.

54
03:53:51,940 --> 03:53:55,239
Earl, this guy's a fighter.

55
03:53:55,311 --> 03:53:58,178
- Oh, yeah?
- Aw, Christ.

56
03:53:58,247 --> 03:54:00,943
Why did I even mention it?
What do you know about it anyway?

57
03:54:01,016 --> 03:54:02,950
- Not much.
- That's what I mean.

58
03:54:03,018 --> 03:54:05,350
Sorry to bother you.
Why'd I open my mouth?

59
03:54:05,421 --> 03:54:07,355
I apologize.

60
03:54:09,124 --> 03:54:11,922
What do you want? I said I was sorry.
What more can I say?

61
03:54:11,994 --> 03:54:15,259
- I hear you, baby.
- Jesus, you sure don't act like it.

62
03:54:16,365 --> 03:54:18,629
I was sparring...

63
03:54:18,701 --> 03:54:20,794
with this young kid.

64
03:54:20,869 --> 03:54:25,135
He's a good prospect. He'd make a lot of
money someday if he was handled right.

65
03:54:25,207 --> 03:54:28,142
A natural athlete.

66
03:54:28,210 --> 03:54:29,871
What's his name?

67
03:54:29,945 --> 03:54:32,345
You wouldn't know who he was
if he did tell you.

68
03:54:32,414 --> 03:54:35,577
- Just asking.
- He's got to know everything.

69
03:54:35,651 --> 03:54:37,983
Aw. Now he's mad.

70
03:54:38,053 --> 03:54:41,079
He's not gonna talk.
He buts in, then he shuts up.

71
03:54:41,156 --> 03:54:43,716
- I want to hear this. Go ahead.
- That's it.

72
03:54:43,792 --> 03:54:46,761
Nothing more to hear.
That is all.

73
03:54:46,829 --> 03:54:48,820
The kid is a natural...

74
03:54:48,897 --> 03:54:52,389
and they come along
about one in a million.

75
03:54:56,205 --> 03:54:59,038
He's so goddamned sour.

76
03:54:59,108 --> 03:55:02,441
I don't see why
I can't have a little fun.

77
03:55:02,511 --> 03:55:06,038
I believe that everybody has
a right to live his own life.

78
03:55:06,115 --> 03:55:08,310
So screw everybody.

79
03:55:11,320 --> 03:55:13,288
I want to say something.

80
03:55:13,355 --> 03:55:16,051
I want to make a toast here
to this gentleman.

81
03:55:16,125 --> 03:55:18,821
I'll make it short...
just a few words.

82
03:55:18,894 --> 03:55:21,021
Here's to your health.

83
03:55:21,096 --> 03:55:24,588
God bless you and keep you
in all your battles.

84
03:55:24,666 --> 03:55:26,964
What is it?

85
03:55:27,035 --> 03:55:29,697
Oh, for Christ sakes.
What do you want?

86
03:55:29,772 --> 03:55:32,468
- Can't I even talk to anybody?
- I'm not stopping you.

87
03:55:32,541 --> 03:55:35,032
No. No, you're not stopping me.

88
03:55:35,110 --> 03:55:39,672
You just sit with your face shut
until the minute I start having fun.

89
03:55:39,748 --> 03:55:43,013
I'm sick of your bellyaching.
Is it my fault you can't fit in?

90
03:55:43,085 --> 03:55:45,417
Why can't you mind
your own business?

91
03:55:45,487 --> 03:55:47,785
And that goes for the rest of you.

92
03:55:49,124 --> 03:55:51,058
Oh, to hell with you.

93
03:56:21,290 --> 03:56:24,157
Want to fight, kid?

94
03:56:24,226 --> 03:56:26,786
- What's your weight?
- 175.

95
03:56:26,862 --> 03:56:30,354
Yeah, you've got a very good reach.
Looking for a manager?

96
03:56:30,432 --> 03:56:32,696
Yeah, I'm looking for Ruben Luna.

97
03:56:36,939 --> 03:56:38,270
Thanks.

98
03:56:53,689 --> 03:56:55,554
I'm Luna.
You want to see me?

99
03:56:55,624 --> 03:56:57,956
I thought I'd work out a little bit.
See what you think.

100
03:56:58,026 --> 03:57:00,460
- Billy Tully told me to come by.
- You know Billy?

101
03:57:00,529 --> 03:57:03,555
You got your stuff in there?
Get into your trunks.

102
03:57:06,101 --> 03:57:09,127
- What's Billy doing these days?
- He didn't say.

103
03:57:09,204 --> 03:57:11,934
I only met him once, at the Y.
Just sparred a little.

104
03:57:12,007 --> 03:57:14,976
How did you do with him? All right?
You must have done all right.

105
03:57:16,345 --> 03:57:19,872
Is Tully getting in shape?
Why was he at the Y instead of the Lido?

106
03:57:19,948 --> 03:57:22,041
I think he's afraid to show
his face around here.

107
03:57:22,117 --> 03:57:25,052
He was in about a year ago.
Said he wanted to start fighting again.

108
03:57:25,120 --> 03:57:28,214
Trained for three days, borrowed $20,
I haven't seen him since.

109
03:57:28,290 --> 03:57:31,657
Look what Felix Castillo done to me.
You know how much money I gave that guy?

110
03:57:31,727 --> 03:57:34,753
I used to give him $2, $3
nearly every damn day.

111
03:57:34,830 --> 03:57:37,128
It was movies, movies,
every damn day.

112
03:57:37,199 --> 03:57:39,565
Tully didn't know how to punch
when he first came to me.

113
03:57:39,635 --> 03:57:43,469
I put him on his way to the top.
He was the best fighter I ever handled.

114
03:57:43,539 --> 03:57:45,131
He was tough and had heart.

115
03:57:45,207 --> 03:57:48,108
But you can't watch a guy
24 hours a day.

116
03:57:48,176 --> 03:57:51,612
He married some broad, and she undid
all the good I did for him.

117
03:57:51,680 --> 03:57:56,811
And she destroyed his peace of mind.
He started losing, so she ran off.

118
03:57:56,885 --> 03:57:59,786
- Come on, kid. You all set?
- Time!

119
03:58:05,727 --> 03:58:07,695
I'm not rushing you.
I don't want you to think that.

120
03:58:07,763 --> 03:58:10,095
I just want to get a good look at you.
Wes.

121
03:58:40,529 --> 03:58:42,121
Sorry.

122
03:58:47,102 --> 03:58:48,296
Time!

123
03:58:53,141 --> 03:58:55,336
You're okay.

124
03:58:58,146 --> 03:59:01,206
Easy. It's okay.

125
03:59:01,283 --> 03:59:03,342
All, right, now...

126
03:59:05,520 --> 03:59:08,045
You step in with that jab, right?

127
03:59:08,123 --> 03:59:10,683
His head goes back.
Hit him again.

128
03:59:10,759 --> 03:59:12,750
Okay, again.
Hit him with the right!

129
03:59:12,828 --> 03:59:14,420
Okay. All right.

130
03:59:14,496 --> 03:59:16,726
That's it.

131
03:59:16,798 --> 03:59:18,288
Feint him.
Make your openings.

132
03:59:18,367 --> 03:59:20,460
You make your openings,
then bing, bing, bing!

133
03:59:20,535 --> 03:59:22,628
- Understand what I mean?
- Yeah.

134
03:59:22,704 --> 03:59:24,638
Okay.
There you go.

135
03:59:27,943 --> 03:59:31,071
A white kid came in today
that might shape up into something.

136
03:59:31,146 --> 03:59:33,080
That's good.

137
03:59:33,148 --> 03:59:35,776
He's got a great reach
and a good pair of legs.

138
03:59:35,851 --> 03:59:37,785
And he's white, you know?

139
03:59:37,853 --> 03:59:40,185
Real clean, good-looking kid.

140
03:59:40,255 --> 03:59:44,089
I've got nothing against coloreds,
there's just too many in the game.

141
03:59:44,159 --> 03:59:46,719
Anglos don't want to pay
to see two colored guys fight.

142
03:59:46,795 --> 03:59:49,229
They want to see a white guy fight.

143
03:59:49,297 --> 03:59:51,765
This kid could develop.

144
03:59:51,833 --> 03:59:55,269
Oh, you ought to see the reach on him.
And he's tall, you know?

145
03:59:55,337 --> 03:59:59,296
If he put on some weight, he could turn
into a good-looking white heavyweight.

146
03:59:59,374 --> 04:00:02,036
Oh, he could draw crowds someday...

147
04:00:02,110 --> 04:00:04,237
if he ever learned how to fight.

148
04:00:04,312 --> 04:00:06,780
Well, maybe he can
if he just listened to me...

149
04:00:06,848 --> 04:00:09,612
and let me put
everything I know into him.

150
04:00:14,089 --> 04:00:15,954
Sweetheart, you awake?

151
04:00:29,504 --> 04:00:32,064
Who wants to go to work?
Onion toppers, 20 cents a box.

152
04:00:35,544 --> 04:00:38,104
Tomatoes, 60 cents a box.

153
04:00:38,180 --> 04:00:39,943
Tomatoes, over here.

154
04:00:48,824 --> 04:00:51,691
Let's pick those cucumbers!
Twenty cents a box!

155
04:00:58,734 --> 04:01:00,998
Who wants to go to work?

156
04:01:01,069 --> 04:01:03,230
Let's go pick those melons.

157
04:01:06,441 --> 04:01:10,639
Who wants to go to work?
Onion toppers, 20 cents a sack.

158
04:01:10,712 --> 04:01:13,180
Melons. Come on,
let's go pick those melons.

159
04:01:23,425 --> 04:01:25,985
Cucumbers, 20 cents a box!

160
04:01:31,967 --> 04:01:33,457
How much per sack?

161
04:01:33,535 --> 04:01:36,231
If a man wants to work,
he could make $15, $20 a day.

162
04:01:36,304 --> 04:01:38,238
- How much per sack?
- Twenty cents.

163
04:01:38,306 --> 04:01:40,433
Go on up.

164
04:01:40,509 --> 04:01:43,034
Onion toppers over here.

165
04:01:45,814 --> 04:01:49,511
Young feller like you
ought to have a proper job.

166
04:01:49,584 --> 04:01:52,314
I had a job.
I just got fired.

167
04:01:52,387 --> 04:01:54,514
What was it?
Maybe I can get it.

168
04:01:54,589 --> 04:01:56,819
Fry cook.

169
04:01:56,892 --> 04:01:58,826
Oh, I can't cook.

170
04:02:00,295 --> 04:02:01,819
I can't either.

171
04:02:02,664 --> 04:02:07,101
Worked my ass for eight bucks yesterday.
Good God. Here I am in this bus again.

172
04:02:07,169 --> 04:02:09,569
You made eight bucks?
Heck, you make more than I did.

173
04:02:09,638 --> 04:02:11,731
I worked like hell yesterday.

174
04:02:11,807 --> 04:02:15,174
After they made the deductions,
I only had five bucks left.

175
04:02:15,243 --> 04:02:17,609
It's sure tough to make
a buck these days.

176
04:04:17,299 --> 04:04:21,133
Now, keep that head moving.
All the time, move it, move it.

177
04:04:23,271 --> 04:04:26,968
- I bought Ernie an amateur license.
- Great. You'll be out five bucks.

178
04:04:27,042 --> 04:04:28,907
No, he won't quit.
Guess what happened.

179
04:04:28,977 --> 04:04:32,242
The doctor wanted to test his blood,
could hardly get the needle in.

180
04:04:32,314 --> 04:04:34,805
- Dull needle, huh?
- No, he tried two needles.

181
04:04:34,883 --> 04:04:36,373
- Who, Ernie?
- Yeah.

182
04:04:36,451 --> 04:04:39,420
- Doctor could hardly get the needle in.
- Dull needle?

183
04:04:39,487 --> 04:04:41,045
The kid's got leather skin.

184
04:04:41,122 --> 04:04:43,113
That's very odd, Ruben.

185
04:04:43,191 --> 04:04:45,091
Never would have thought that,
looking at him.

186
04:04:45,160 --> 04:04:47,560
Rudy Chavez had thick skin,
but he was tough.

187
04:04:47,629 --> 04:04:49,995
You guys know that.
They don't make 'em like him anymore.

188
04:04:50,065 --> 04:04:53,762
You haven't heard the half of it.
He gets the needle in and blood out...

189
04:04:53,835 --> 04:04:55,359
and it's almost black.

190
04:04:55,437 --> 04:04:57,905
I had Chavez in
against Chu Chu Montoya.

191
04:04:57,973 --> 04:05:01,238
In the first round, my boy gets butted
over the eye. Blood starts coming down.

192
04:05:01,309 --> 04:05:04,039
So I said, "Well, there goes the fight."

193
04:05:04,112 --> 04:05:06,672
It wasn't his blood at all.
It was Montoya's blood.

194
04:05:06,748 --> 04:05:10,343
Remember Estrada? I saw him open
a Coke bottle with his teeth.

195
04:05:10,418 --> 04:05:12,318
- What are you saying...
- Will you listen, please?

196
04:05:12,387 --> 04:05:15,356
You haven't heard the half of it.
He finally gets the blood out...

197
04:05:15,423 --> 04:05:16,788
and it's black.

198
04:05:16,858 --> 04:05:20,453
So he stares at it for a minute
and turns the tube upside-down...

199
04:05:20,528 --> 04:05:22,962
and the blood don't run down,
it hangs up there.

200
04:05:23,031 --> 04:05:25,192
It turned to gelatin.

201
04:05:25,266 --> 04:05:28,099
Chavez had the clearest piss
of any fighter I ever saw.

202
04:05:28,169 --> 04:05:30,433
He would take a specimen,
and the piss in that bottle...

203
04:05:30,505 --> 04:05:32,496
would be just as clean and as pure...

204
04:05:32,574 --> 04:05:35,134
as fresh drinking water.

205
04:05:49,924 --> 04:05:51,858
Take the wheel.

206
04:05:58,233 --> 04:06:01,498
No, easy! Slow and easy.
That's it.

207
04:06:02,704 --> 04:06:05,229
Go easy! Go easy!

208
04:06:13,048 --> 04:06:14,845
Don't spin the wheels!

209
04:06:14,916 --> 04:06:18,010
- Hold it.
- What are you saying?

210
04:06:18,086 --> 04:06:21,681
- I can't hear you. What?
- Will you hold it, Faye?

211
04:06:21,756 --> 04:06:24,657
I'm gonna look for some boards
to put under the wheels.

212
04:06:35,603 --> 04:06:37,036
Hold it!

213
04:06:48,516 --> 04:06:50,416
Move over.

214
04:07:09,270 --> 04:07:11,067
Don't touch me.
I'm all muddy.

215
04:07:11,139 --> 04:07:15,075
I don't care if you're muddy or not.
Put your arm around me.

216
04:07:15,143 --> 04:07:17,202
Not while I'm driving in the rain.

217
04:07:21,850 --> 04:07:24,080
I'm glad.

218
04:07:24,152 --> 04:07:25,449
About what?

219
04:07:25,520 --> 04:07:28,387
You know.
Not being a virgin anymore.

220
04:07:32,427 --> 04:07:34,258
What?

221
04:07:34,329 --> 04:07:37,196
Not that I'd feel any different.

222
04:07:37,265 --> 04:07:41,031
It's just that I thought
I'd see the world through new eyes.

223
04:07:41,102 --> 04:07:43,332
But I don't.

224
04:07:44,906 --> 04:07:48,398
- You've never done it before?
- Certainly not.

225
04:07:53,047 --> 04:07:55,607
You've done it lots of times,
I suppose.

226
04:07:56,551 --> 04:07:59,281
Well, I'm going on 19, after all.

227
04:07:59,354 --> 04:08:02,346
How was I compared to the other girls?

228
04:08:02,423 --> 04:08:04,015
All right.

229
04:08:05,894 --> 04:08:07,725
I mean, wonderful.
You were wonderful.

230
04:08:07,795 --> 04:08:10,764
- Really?
- Yeah, wonderful.

231
04:08:11,766 --> 04:08:13,791
I'll get better with practice.

232
04:08:13,868 --> 04:08:16,393
Anybody would have thought you had
all the practice in the world.

233
04:08:20,108 --> 04:08:24,306
- Hope you're not implying anything.
- No, I meant you were wonderful.

234
04:08:27,582 --> 04:08:29,174
Will you call me tomorrow?

235
04:08:29,250 --> 04:08:31,718
What for?

236
04:08:31,786 --> 04:08:33,754
No reason.

237
04:08:33,821 --> 04:08:36,289
Just want to hear
the sound of your voice.

238
04:08:45,533 --> 04:08:47,660
Let's go, guys.

239
04:08:59,447 --> 04:09:01,381
Let's go, Babe!

240
04:09:08,289 --> 04:09:10,416
Monterey, here we come!

241
04:09:10,491 --> 04:09:12,652
We got the winners tonight, Babe.
What do you think?

242
04:09:12,727 --> 04:09:15,719
- Yeah, I think we got the winners.
- For sure winners.

243
04:09:15,797 --> 04:09:17,992
- You know what I'd like to do someday?
- What?

244
04:09:18,066 --> 04:09:22,332
Take these guys to England.
They really appreciate class over there.

245
04:09:22,403 --> 04:09:25,930
When we turn these boys pro,
I'd really like to make that trip.

246
04:09:31,746 --> 04:09:33,407
Nice house today.

247
04:09:34,482 --> 04:09:36,177
Ernie, listen.

248
04:09:36,251 --> 04:09:38,947
This guy can't fight.
You'll knock him out. How do you feel?

249
04:09:39,020 --> 04:09:40,954
- Hardly wait to get in?
- I'll give it all I've got.

250
04:09:41,022 --> 04:09:43,650
You may have to go the full three,
so don't punch yourself out.

251
04:09:43,725 --> 04:09:45,454
- Don't lose your head.
- Pace myself.

252
04:09:45,526 --> 04:09:48,188
Look, don't hang back.
It goes fast.

253
04:09:48,263 --> 04:09:51,027
- Give it everything I got.
- Still you want to pace yourself.

254
04:09:51,099 --> 04:09:54,694
Buford, your guy's been around.
Don't let him get a good shot at you.

255
04:09:54,769 --> 04:09:57,636
He's a boozer. You know how these
soldiers are. He won't go the limit.

256
04:09:57,705 --> 04:10:00,799
I don't care who he is,
'cause ain't nobody getting past me.

257
04:10:00,875 --> 04:10:03,309
I'm gonna be the world's champ
by the time I'm 18.

258
04:10:03,378 --> 04:10:05,903
- Ain't he 18 now?
- Shit, he's only 15.

259
04:10:05,980 --> 04:10:08,175
- Can you fight if you're 15?
- Would you be quiet about that?

260
04:10:08,249 --> 04:10:11,150
Buford's Golden Gloves champion.
He don't fit the rules.

261
04:10:16,391 --> 04:10:19,019
Hope I didn't leave
my fight in the bedroom.

262
04:10:19,093 --> 04:10:21,584
Don't tell Ruben, but I was
getting a little last night.

263
04:10:21,663 --> 04:10:23,358
- Hope I'm in shape.
- I was too.

264
04:10:23,431 --> 04:10:25,695
But that don't make no difference.
It don't matter if you're dead drunk.

265
04:10:25,767 --> 04:10:28,531
You got two hands. You can beat
this dude. I don't care who he is.

266
04:10:28,603 --> 04:10:30,730
It's all in your mind.

267
04:10:30,805 --> 04:10:31,999
I hope so.

268
04:10:32,073 --> 04:10:34,371
Hoping never done nothing.
It's wanting to do it.

269
04:10:34,442 --> 04:10:36,706
You got to want to win
so bad you can taste it.

270
04:10:36,778 --> 04:10:40,578
If you want to win bad enough, you win.
No way in hell this dude will beat me.

271
04:10:40,648 --> 04:10:43,776
He's too old. I'm too fast.
I'm gonna be all over him.

272
04:10:43,851 --> 04:10:46,581
I'm gonna kick his ass so bad,
every time he eats food tomorrow...

273
04:10:46,654 --> 04:10:47,951
he'll think of me.

274
04:10:48,022 --> 04:10:51,048
He's gonna know he's been in a fight,
'cause I'll hit him with everything.

275
04:10:51,125 --> 04:10:53,616
I'm not just gonna beat that mother,
I'm gonna kill him.

276
04:10:53,695 --> 04:10:55,629
- You know what makes a good fighter?
- What?

277
04:10:55,697 --> 04:10:59,599
Believing in yourself, the will to win.
You want to kick ass, you kick ass.

278
04:10:59,667 --> 04:11:01,601
- You're right.
- You don't want to kick ass.

279
04:11:01,669 --> 04:11:03,296
You want to get
your own ass whupped.

280
04:11:03,371 --> 04:11:05,134
I want to kick ass.
Don't worry.

281
04:11:05,206 --> 04:11:09,336
You gotta want to kick ass so bad there
ain't no manager or pill that can do it.

282
04:11:09,410 --> 04:11:12,607
- I want to kick ass as bad as you do.
- Then go out there and kick ass!

283
04:11:12,680 --> 04:11:14,671
- All right!
- First bout, Ernie Munger.

284
04:11:16,184 --> 04:11:18,982
We got to go now.
Hey, did you get the towels?

285
04:11:19,053 --> 04:11:21,021
- I didn't get to warm up.
- You're okay. You're ready.

286
04:11:21,089 --> 04:11:23,148
- Just stay loose. Where's the bucket?
- In my hand.

287
04:11:23,224 --> 04:11:24,816
- Where's the bottle.
- In the bucket.

288
04:11:24,892 --> 04:11:26,883
- Is there water in it?
- I wouldn't bring an empty bottle.

289
04:11:26,961 --> 04:11:29,327
I just don't want my kid out there
without any water.

290
04:11:29,397 --> 04:11:31,524
I told you I got the water.
Take it easy.

291
04:11:31,599 --> 04:11:33,533
Let's go.

292
04:11:40,775 --> 04:11:42,936
<i>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

293
04:11:43,010 --> 04:11:46,605
<i>Welcome to tonight's star-studded</i>
<i>program of amateur boxing.</i>

294
04:11:46,681 --> 04:11:50,481
Each bout will consist of
three two-minute rounds...

295
04:11:50,551 --> 04:11:53,452
in accordance with the California
State Athletic Commission.

296
04:11:53,521 --> 04:11:56,456
Your referee, from San Francisco,
Ron Dixon.

297
04:11:56,524 --> 04:11:59,982
This is the first bout of the night.
Introducing first, in the blue corner...

298
04:12:00,061 --> 04:12:03,053
weighing 170 pounds,
from Stockton...

299
04:12:03,131 --> 04:12:04,996
Irish Ernie Munger.

300
04:12:05,066 --> 04:12:06,829
I'm not Irish.

301
04:12:06,901 --> 04:12:09,131
I just said it that way
so they'd know you're white.

302
04:12:09,203 --> 04:12:11,797
It'll look great in the paper.
Wave to the crowd.

303
04:12:11,873 --> 04:12:16,105
<i>In the red corner,</i>
<i>weighing 172 pounds, from Salinas...</i>

304
04:12:16,177 --> 04:12:19,010
<i>Manuel Rosales.</i>

305
04:12:19,080 --> 04:12:21,844
I want both you boys to be sure
to protect yourselves at all times.

306
04:12:41,602 --> 04:12:43,502
Jab, baby! Jab!

307
04:12:47,508 --> 04:12:49,999
Right jab! Yeah!
That's it, baby!

308
04:12:57,318 --> 04:12:59,252
Move, move, move!

309
04:13:04,058 --> 04:13:07,289
Jab, jab! Jab!

310
04:13:15,102 --> 04:13:17,036
That's the stuff!

311
04:13:17,104 --> 04:13:18,901
Terrific!

312
04:13:22,009 --> 04:13:23,806
Right in there!

313
04:14:05,219 --> 04:14:08,916
This guy's finished. Unload on him.
Move in there, Ernie. Use the hook.

314
04:14:08,990 --> 04:14:11,959
- Work him in. Two punches...
- Keep your punches up.

315
04:14:12,026 --> 04:14:14,017
- You can take him.
- Tear his head off.

316
04:14:14,095 --> 04:14:16,256
- Jab, jab, hook.
- Seconds out.

317
04:14:37,051 --> 04:14:39,042
Break.

318
04:15:04,078 --> 04:15:07,946
<i>The winner by technical knockout,</i>
<i>in the red corner, from Salinas...</i>

319
04:15:08,015 --> 04:15:10,381
<i>Manuel Rosales.</i>

320
04:15:15,556 --> 04:15:17,023
Good fight.

321
04:15:17,091 --> 04:15:18,786
Tilt your head back.
Breathe through your mouth.

322
04:15:18,859 --> 04:15:21,794
- He was butting you.
- Sure we was butting. He can't punch.

323
04:15:25,499 --> 04:15:27,433
I'm all right.

324
04:15:29,670 --> 04:15:31,831
Next bout, Henry Reed.
Come on.

325
04:15:38,646 --> 04:15:42,377
- You lose, huh?
- They shouldn't have stopped it.

326
04:15:42,450 --> 04:15:44,645
You ought to get a note
from the doctor before you leave.

327
04:15:44,719 --> 04:15:47,313
You can get that nose set
and it won't cost you nothing.

328
04:15:47,388 --> 04:15:49,982
Get him out of those trunks.
He was butted, Al.

329
04:15:50,057 --> 04:15:51,991
They should throw that kid
out of the ring.

330
04:15:52,059 --> 04:15:54,118
- Get into your trunks.
- He's all bloody.

331
04:15:54,195 --> 04:15:56,186
Don't worry about it.
It's not your blood.

332
04:15:56,263 --> 04:15:58,823
Let me look at that.
Easy. Don't touch it.

333
04:15:58,899 --> 04:16:00,115
Don't touch it!

334
04:16:00,150 --> 04:16:01,331
Don't touch it!

335
04:16:09,477 --> 04:16:12,640
Buford, you doing all right?
How do you feel?

336
04:16:12,713 --> 04:16:15,147
Just pissed off, Ruben.

337
04:16:15,216 --> 04:16:17,810
You dropped your left.
Don't sweat over it.

338
04:16:17,885 --> 04:16:20,683
You get him again,
you'll knock him out next time.

339
04:16:20,755 --> 04:16:23,952
Ernie, you'll get that nose fixed
good as new. Don't worry.

340
04:16:24,025 --> 04:16:26,755
Look at mine. Would you believe
mine was ever busted?

341
04:16:26,827 --> 04:16:28,317
Yes.

342
04:16:30,498 --> 04:16:33,956
I don't know what deal we're getting
tonight, but I've never seen its like.

343
04:16:34,035 --> 04:16:36,128
Stopping that fight
when Ernie had that guy beat...

344
04:16:36,203 --> 04:16:38,068
That kid should have been
disqualified.

345
04:16:38,139 --> 04:16:42,041
And Wes wasn't hurt either. Anyone
can get tagged in the first round.

346
04:16:42,109 --> 04:16:44,168
And Bobby won every round.

347
04:16:44,245 --> 04:16:47,544
He did. That's a fact.
That was robbery if I've ever seen it.

348
04:16:47,615 --> 04:16:50,812
You were hurting that boy.

349
04:16:50,885 --> 04:16:53,251
Hey, sweetheart.
Sweetheart.

350
04:16:55,289 --> 04:16:58,656
Can we have more beer
and pop for the boys?

351
04:17:23,684 --> 04:17:24,981
Glass of beer, please.

352
04:17:40,701 --> 04:17:42,100
Hi!

353
04:17:45,039 --> 04:17:48,304
- How've you been keeping?
- Terrible.

354
04:18:05,626 --> 04:18:07,560
Are you alone?

355
04:18:09,396 --> 04:18:12,126
Mind if I sit down?

356
04:18:12,199 --> 04:18:14,759
It's a free country.
Help yourself.

357
04:18:17,271 --> 04:18:19,705
Where's your old man?

358
04:18:21,308 --> 04:18:23,242
In jail.

359
04:18:24,745 --> 04:18:25,734
What for?

360
04:18:27,982 --> 04:18:31,247
Because they won't leave you alone
in this world, that's why.

361
04:18:33,587 --> 04:18:36,784
You don't know what you have
to take when you're interracial.

362
04:18:36,857 --> 04:18:40,816
Every bum on the street
has to get a look at you.

363
04:18:40,895 --> 04:18:42,863
Earl...

364
04:18:42,930 --> 04:18:44,955
he's a peaceable man.

365
04:18:45,032 --> 04:18:46,829
Even-tempered.

366
04:18:46,901 --> 04:18:50,598
He did not hurt that guy.
It was a nick on the back of the neck.

367
04:18:50,671 --> 04:18:53,003
He'd wouldn't any more try
to assault somebody...

368
04:18:53,073 --> 04:18:56,509
than you'd get on that stool
and try to fly.

369
04:18:58,345 --> 04:19:01,280
He's not made that way.

370
04:19:01,348 --> 04:19:04,681
He's the sweetest-natured man
in the world.

371
04:19:04,752 --> 04:19:07,414
He'll get out.

372
04:19:08,255 --> 04:19:10,519
He's so jealous.

373
04:19:10,591 --> 04:19:13,151
I wouldn't put it past him
to be out already...

374
04:19:13,227 --> 04:19:15,320
spying on every move I make.

375
04:19:17,665 --> 04:19:20,896
He's so possessive.
He won't let me talk to people.

376
04:19:20,968 --> 04:19:23,095
He gets mad at me.

377
04:19:23,170 --> 04:19:27,334
You remember the last time we talked?
Way back then, remember?

378
04:19:27,408 --> 04:19:29,672
Do you know what he did
to me afterwards?

379
04:19:29,743 --> 04:19:31,142
He raped me.

380
04:19:31,212 --> 04:19:34,238
- No shit?
- Yes.

381
04:19:34,315 --> 04:19:37,341
He picked me up
and he threw me on that bed.

382
04:19:40,120 --> 04:19:42,054
Don't look at me like that.

383
04:19:42,122 --> 04:19:44,147
I'm not ashamed to say it.

384
04:19:44,225 --> 04:19:46,750
I've never been ashamed
of the act of love.

385
04:19:46,827 --> 04:19:48,761
I believe it's a part of life.

386
04:19:48,829 --> 04:19:51,491
Sure. Why not?
You should.

387
04:19:51,565 --> 04:19:54,659
Of course,
if people like each other...

388
04:19:54,735 --> 04:19:58,899
I'm not talking about free love.
I have no use for that.

389
04:20:00,474 --> 04:20:02,806
You know, free
depends what you mean "free."

390
04:20:04,144 --> 04:20:06,078
I mean...

391
04:20:06,146 --> 04:20:08,080
if it's not...

392
04:20:09,850 --> 04:20:13,445
free, can you call it love?

393
04:20:13,520 --> 04:20:15,920
I'm talking about love.

394
04:20:15,990 --> 04:20:18,652
Real love, not just sex.

395
04:20:20,427 --> 04:20:23,021
When you're really in love,
you marry for life...

396
04:20:23,097 --> 04:20:26,430
and that is the only way it can be.

397
04:20:26,500 --> 04:20:30,493
I don't consider
my second marriage sanctified.

398
04:20:30,571 --> 04:20:32,664
I should've stayed true to Frank.

399
04:20:32,740 --> 04:20:34,901
Frank?
Who's Frank?

400
04:20:34,975 --> 04:20:38,877
Frank.
That was my first husband.

401
04:20:38,946 --> 04:20:41,744
He's full-blooded Cherokee.

402
04:20:41,815 --> 04:20:43,840
You married an Indian?

403
04:20:43,918 --> 04:20:46,318
What's wrong with that?
You think you're any better?

404
04:20:46,387 --> 04:20:49,049
- I'm not bagging on it.
- You just watch what you say.

405
04:20:49,123 --> 04:20:52,092
I won't stand for any insults
against Frank.

406
04:20:55,596 --> 04:20:57,496
I still wear his wedding ring.

407
04:21:01,435 --> 04:21:03,426
Where is he?

408
04:21:04,905 --> 04:21:06,668
I'm a widow.

409
04:21:08,909 --> 04:21:10,638
That's too bad.

410
04:21:10,711 --> 04:21:13,509
I'm sorry to hear that.
What happened to him?

411
04:21:14,648 --> 04:21:16,843
He was shot.

412
04:21:18,619 --> 04:21:20,553
No kidding?

413
04:21:26,160 --> 04:21:29,027
- Who did it?
- He was a police officer.

414
04:21:30,497 --> 04:21:32,897
He was killed in the line of duty.

415
04:21:34,768 --> 04:21:36,599
That's terrible.

416
04:21:39,239 --> 04:21:41,400
I was married too.

417
04:21:41,475 --> 04:21:44,069
She ran out on me.

418
04:21:44,144 --> 04:21:47,170
We didn't even have time
to have children.

419
04:21:48,515 --> 04:21:50,881
I married white the next time.
All he was good for...

420
04:21:50,951 --> 04:21:53,249
was running us off an embankment.

421
04:21:53,320 --> 04:21:56,517
That and spending the insurance.

422
04:21:56,590 --> 04:22:00,583
Marrying him was the biggest
mistake of my life.

423
04:22:00,661 --> 04:22:03,528
He had unnatural desires.

424
04:22:05,332 --> 04:22:06,663
He did?

425
04:22:06,734 --> 04:22:08,793
The white race is in its decline.

426
04:22:08,869 --> 04:22:12,862
It started downhill in 1492
when Columbus discovered syphilis.

427
04:22:14,575 --> 04:22:17,510
- What did he want to do?
- White men are animals.

428
04:22:17,578 --> 04:22:20,513
- We're not so bad.
- White man is the vermin of the earth.

429
04:22:20,581 --> 04:22:22,879
- Not so loud.
- Don't tell me what to do.

430
04:22:22,950 --> 04:22:25,714
I don't care who hears me. I know
I'm making a nuisance of myself...

431
04:22:25,786 --> 04:22:28,084
to all these goddamn Mexicans
sitting here.

432
04:22:28,155 --> 04:22:30,521
They don't know who
their real friends are.

433
04:22:30,591 --> 04:22:34,049
- What are you going on about?
- Take your hands off me!

434
04:22:34,128 --> 04:22:37,359
You are liable to get backhanded
right off that stool.

435
04:22:37,431 --> 04:22:39,695
You see if I care one bit!
That's all I need!

436
04:22:39,767 --> 04:22:41,701
You go ahead,
if it'll make you feel so good!

437
04:22:41,769 --> 04:22:43,669
- I'm sorry.
- Get it out of your system!

438
04:22:43,737 --> 04:22:46,570
Go on, if it'll make you feel good!
Punch me in the face!

439
04:22:46,640 --> 04:22:49,200
- God Almighty.
- Take some teeth out while you're at it!

440
04:22:49,276 --> 04:22:51,904
I still got a few left. The others
were nice enough to leave me.

441
04:22:51,979 --> 04:22:54,914
- I wouldn't hit you. I'm sorry.
- It'll be a big lift for you.

442
04:22:54,982 --> 04:22:57,143
What are you waiting for?
It's just the thing you need!

443
04:22:57,217 --> 04:22:59,549
Far be it from me
to spoil anybody's fun!

444
04:22:59,620 --> 04:23:02,987
I'm sorry! Will you listen to me,
goddamn it? I am sorry!

445
04:23:03,057 --> 04:23:05,719
So what?
So you're sorry.

446
04:23:07,161 --> 04:23:09,823
Well, I feel like banging my head.

447
04:23:09,897 --> 04:23:12,627
Go ahead!
I'm not gonna stop you.

448
04:23:12,699 --> 04:23:15,600
Feel like I could just bust my head...

449
04:23:17,337 --> 04:23:18,565
on that jukebox.

450
04:23:18,639 --> 04:23:20,129
Go ahead!

451
04:23:29,016 --> 04:23:30,813
What did you do that for?

452
04:23:32,719 --> 04:23:34,949
You told me to go ahead and do it,
so I did it.

453
04:23:36,523 --> 04:23:39,651
You can count on me
right down the line.

454
04:23:39,726 --> 04:23:41,694
You want to knock your brains out?

455
04:23:42,696 --> 04:23:45,824
You can count on me.

456
04:23:48,001 --> 04:23:50,265
Just don't bump your head anymore.

457
04:23:50,337 --> 04:23:51,929
Listen.

458
04:23:53,340 --> 04:23:55,308
Let me tell you something.

459
04:23:56,910 --> 04:24:00,175
You can count on me...

460
04:24:00,247 --> 04:24:02,909
right down the line.

461
04:24:05,219 --> 04:24:07,380
I thought you wanted to hit me.

462
04:24:07,454 --> 04:24:10,048
Oh, God.
Will you forget that?

463
04:24:10,124 --> 04:24:12,217
I never hit a woman in my life.

464
04:24:16,763 --> 04:24:18,492
Let me buy you a drink.

465
04:24:20,234 --> 04:24:22,532
Could we have two
cream sherries, please?

466
04:24:25,539 --> 04:24:28,508
Won't you believe me?

467
04:24:28,575 --> 04:24:31,874
Don't you think
that you can count on me?

468
04:24:39,953 --> 04:24:42,251
Just don't bump your head anymore.

469
04:24:42,322 --> 04:24:45,450
Oh, come on.
Will you forget that?

470
04:24:47,127 --> 04:24:49,527
Hey, listen.
I just asked you a question.

471
04:24:51,798 --> 04:24:54,892
Do you think I'd let you down?

472
04:24:54,968 --> 04:24:56,629
I don't know.
Would you?

473
04:24:56,703 --> 04:24:59,934
Hey, I wouldn't.
I wouldn't.

474
04:25:00,007 --> 04:25:03,807
Maybe you wouldn't.
How would I know?

475
04:25:06,613 --> 04:25:08,410
You...

476
04:25:08,482 --> 04:25:10,211
can...

477
04:25:10,284 --> 04:25:11,717
count...

478
04:25:14,388 --> 04:25:16,788
on me.

479
04:25:16,857 --> 04:25:19,451
You can count on me.

480
04:25:19,526 --> 04:25:21,619
No, I'm the reliable type.

481
04:25:21,695 --> 04:25:24,630
Do you know who your friends are?

482
04:25:24,698 --> 04:25:28,031
Listen. Anytime...

483
04:25:28,101 --> 04:25:30,296
you need anything...

484
04:25:30,370 --> 04:25:32,361
you just come and see me.

485
04:25:34,074 --> 04:25:38,170
These others,
I wouldn't ask the time of day.

486
04:25:38,245 --> 04:25:41,146
They wouldn't give it to you.

487
04:25:41,215 --> 04:25:43,706
Do you know something?

488
04:25:43,784 --> 04:25:46,912
You're the only son of a bitch
worth a shit in this place.

489
04:25:48,889 --> 04:25:51,187
I appreciate that.

490
04:25:51,258 --> 04:25:53,351
Because...

491
04:25:53,427 --> 04:25:56,419
there is something
I really like about you.

492
04:25:58,298 --> 04:26:00,493
I like you too.

493
04:26:09,042 --> 04:26:10,202
To us.

494
04:26:17,251 --> 04:26:20,482
Let's get out of this joint.

495
04:26:20,554 --> 04:26:22,852
Let's go somewhere else.

496
04:26:29,630 --> 04:26:31,564
Keep the change.

497
04:26:45,479 --> 04:26:47,743
Hey, you all right?

498
04:26:47,814 --> 04:26:51,375
- I don't know.
- You gonna make it?

499
04:26:51,451 --> 04:26:53,385
I guess I'm drunk.

500
04:26:55,122 --> 04:26:57,590
Don't worry about anything.
I'll get you home.

501
04:26:57,658 --> 04:26:59,751
You can count on me.

502
04:27:01,094 --> 04:27:03,028
- Going the right way?
- Yep.

503
04:27:06,833 --> 04:27:08,801
What's the matter?

504
04:27:13,240 --> 04:27:15,265
I love you so much.

505
04:27:19,846 --> 04:27:22,144
Hey, come on.

506
04:27:22,215 --> 04:27:25,480
Everything's gonna be okay now.

507
04:27:25,552 --> 04:27:27,247
I feel it is.

508
04:27:27,321 --> 04:27:29,118
It is.

509
04:27:29,189 --> 04:27:31,248
- You can count on me.
- Right.

510
04:27:31,325 --> 04:27:33,793
- And I can count on you.
- Yep.

511
04:27:33,860 --> 04:27:35,919
<i>I can count on you</i>

512
04:27:35,996 --> 04:27:39,022
<i>And you can count on me</i>

513
04:27:39,099 --> 04:27:41,363
<i>And we can count on each other</i>

514
04:27:44,338 --> 04:27:46,203
- White look all right on me?
- Perfect.

515
04:27:46,273 --> 04:27:48,298
- You professional?
- Amateur.

516
04:27:48,375 --> 04:27:51,276
Won his last three fights.
They couldn't touch him. Kid's fast.

517
04:27:51,345 --> 04:27:54,280
- What do you think?
- It's just the right image for you.

518
04:27:54,348 --> 04:27:57,010
When you come out in that,
you're gonna look like a champ.

519
04:27:58,585 --> 04:28:00,314
Champion of the world.

520
04:28:17,104 --> 04:28:20,562
One, two, three.

521
04:28:26,580 --> 04:28:28,775
<i>The winner by KO...</i>

522
04:28:28,849 --> 04:28:32,216
<i>in 23 seconds of round one...</i>

523
04:28:32,285 --> 04:28:35,277
- Let's get him to his corner.
- Come on, baby. Come on.

524
04:28:37,224 --> 04:28:39,954
Easy.
Take it easy.

525
04:28:42,963 --> 04:28:46,694
What's your name? What's your name?
Where are you?

526
04:28:46,767 --> 04:28:49,793
- Did I get knocked out?
- Tell me your name. Can you do that?

527
04:28:49,870 --> 04:28:52,270
Ernie Munger.
What round is it?

528
04:28:52,339 --> 04:28:54,466
How many fingers do you see?

529
04:28:55,675 --> 04:28:58,872
Can you see my hand?
How many fingers?

530
04:28:58,945 --> 04:29:01,743
- Five.
- He's okay.

531
04:29:01,815 --> 04:29:03,646
You're okay, Ernie.

532
04:29:19,332 --> 04:29:21,493
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

533
04:29:22,803 --> 04:29:25,670
Don't you feel good?

534
04:29:25,739 --> 04:29:28,674
- I'm all right.
- Is anything wrong?

535
04:29:28,742 --> 04:29:31,643
- I said "nothing."
- What are you mad about then?

536
04:29:31,711 --> 04:29:35,807
Can't I be quiet if I feel like it
without everybody getting all worked up?

537
04:29:35,882 --> 04:29:38,851
- You're the only one getting worked up.
- Leave me alone then.

538
04:29:38,919 --> 04:29:41,615
I have a right to my moods.

539
04:29:41,688 --> 04:29:45,146
All right. I can take a hint.
Don't think I don't know what's wrong.

540
04:29:47,360 --> 04:29:49,726
You're unfulfilled.
I know.

541
04:29:49,796 --> 04:29:53,323
I'm fulfilled.
I'm perfectly fulfilled.

542
04:29:53,400 --> 04:29:55,391
That's not what's bothering me.

543
04:29:55,469 --> 04:29:57,630
You didn't get real fulfillment.

544
04:29:57,704 --> 04:30:01,765
Don't worry about that.
I'm fulfilled.

545
04:30:01,842 --> 04:30:04,242
That's not it at all.

546
04:30:04,311 --> 04:30:06,245
You're mad about something.

547
04:30:06,313 --> 04:30:08,440
I'm not mad.

548
04:30:11,251 --> 04:30:14,812
Just a little worried, that's all.

549
04:30:14,888 --> 04:30:16,822
About what?

550
04:30:18,925 --> 04:30:20,984
You know what.

551
04:30:30,637 --> 04:30:33,731
God, we've been pretty careful.

552
04:30:33,807 --> 04:30:37,368
If I was careful, I never would have
come out here in the first place.

553
04:30:38,879 --> 04:30:42,576
You wouldn't marry me now.
I just know you wouldn't.

554
04:30:42,649 --> 04:30:45,379
Men just don't
after the mystery's gone.

555
04:30:46,586 --> 04:30:49,987
They do too. They do it all the time.
What are you talking about?

556
04:30:50,056 --> 04:30:51,956
You wouldn't.

557
04:30:52,025 --> 04:30:54,152
- I would too.
- When?

558
04:30:55,428 --> 04:30:57,896
When it'd be right
for both of us.

559
04:30:57,964 --> 04:31:00,831
We don't want to rush into a mess
when we've got each other anyway.

560
04:31:00,901 --> 04:31:03,836
But don't you want to be with me
every night?

561
04:31:05,272 --> 04:31:08,969
Sure.
Maybe I can get a day job.

562
04:31:09,042 --> 04:31:11,533
Not what I meant.

563
04:31:13,580 --> 04:31:15,673
We don't want to rush into something.

564
04:31:15,749 --> 04:31:18,912
Look, don't think I'm proposing to you.

565
04:31:18,985 --> 04:31:22,421
That's a thing I certainly
would never do.

566
04:31:22,489 --> 04:31:24,616
I wouldn't want anybody
who didn't want me.

567
04:31:24,691 --> 04:31:26,090
I want you.

568
04:31:26,159 --> 04:31:29,026
Certainly wouldn't force myself
on anyone.

569
04:31:29,095 --> 04:31:32,826
It's just, I like to know
where I stand, that's all.

570
04:31:32,899 --> 04:31:36,892
Supposing you got drafted. Would you
expect me to be here when you came back?

571
04:31:36,970 --> 04:31:38,733
Yeah.

572
04:31:38,805 --> 04:31:41,501
Then why should we wait?

573
04:31:41,575 --> 04:31:44,237
I could quit school
and get a job.

574
04:31:44,311 --> 04:31:46,643
I want to be with you all the time.

575
04:31:46,713 --> 04:31:49,807
I want to cook for you.

576
04:31:49,883 --> 04:31:52,078
I don't know how you feel.

577
04:31:54,120 --> 04:31:57,487
I wouldn't want you to marry me
just because you thought you had to.

578
04:31:57,557 --> 04:32:01,323
Huh? Oh, sure.
No one has to, I guess.

579
04:32:01,394 --> 04:32:04,522
I mean, we could do something
about it easy enough.

580
04:32:04,598 --> 04:32:07,226
Yeah.
Sure we could.

581
04:32:07,300 --> 04:32:09,632
But I wouldn't want to.

582
04:32:12,005 --> 04:32:15,406
If I was, I'd want to have it.
Wouldn't you?

583
04:32:15,475 --> 04:32:18,239
Wouldn't you feel anything?

584
04:32:18,311 --> 04:32:19,744
Sure.

585
04:32:21,748 --> 04:32:24,308
Maybe you'd better see a doctor.

586
04:32:37,564 --> 04:32:39,498
Give me a cup of coffee.

587
04:32:42,969 --> 04:32:45,494
- How's it going, Ruben?
- Well, lost another one.

588
04:32:45,572 --> 04:32:48,302
- Ernie snuck off and got married.
- I might have known it.

589
04:32:48,375 --> 04:32:51,902
What kind of pie you want?
Never mind. Give me what he's got.

590
04:32:51,978 --> 04:32:54,503
Boy, she sure knows how
to fill a skirt.

591
04:32:54,581 --> 04:32:57,379
Yeah, I talked to his mother
on the phone. He got married.

592
04:32:57,450 --> 04:33:00,544
- What can you expect?
- All that energy they waste.

593
04:33:00,620 --> 04:33:03,521
If they're not getting married, they're
getting arrested or joining the navy...

594
04:33:03,590 --> 04:33:06,559
or killing themselves on motorcycles.

595
04:33:06,626 --> 04:33:09,652
You know why I think he did it?
I think that beating discouraged him.

596
04:33:09,729 --> 04:33:13,665
If you don't have confidence in yourself
you're never gonna get anywhere.

597
04:33:13,733 --> 04:33:16,258
I remember the first time
I passed blood.

598
04:33:16,336 --> 04:33:18,429
That was one scared kid.

599
04:33:18,505 --> 04:33:21,599
Sure, when I got my jaw broken and had
to suck liquids through a straw...

600
04:33:21,675 --> 04:33:24,974
I started wondering
if it was all worthwhile.

601
04:33:25,045 --> 04:33:27,070
Tell you what bothered me.

602
04:33:27,147 --> 04:33:29,342
Getting my throat ruined.

603
04:33:29,416 --> 04:33:31,748
You didn't keep your chin down.

604
04:33:31,818 --> 04:33:33,945
How's your nose.
Can you breathe?

605
04:33:34,020 --> 04:33:36,079
Yeah, can't you?

606
04:33:36,156 --> 04:33:38,522
Not on a wet day.

607
04:33:49,436 --> 04:33:51,370
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

608
04:33:53,073 --> 04:33:55,007
How'd it go?

609
04:33:55,075 --> 04:33:57,839
Well...

610
04:33:57,911 --> 04:34:01,711
canneries weren't hiring today.

611
04:34:01,781 --> 04:34:03,715
Did you try the box factory?

612
04:34:05,485 --> 04:34:07,851
I've already been fired
from the box factory.

613
04:34:29,709 --> 04:34:31,301
You know...

614
04:34:31,377 --> 04:34:34,312
I guess I'm just gonna have to
start fighting again.

615
04:34:53,867 --> 04:34:55,664
- Honey!
- Yeah?

616
04:34:55,735 --> 04:34:58,966
- I wish you wouldn't do that.
- Do what?

617
04:34:59,038 --> 04:35:01,029
Kick Earl's box.

618
04:35:01,107 --> 04:35:04,372
I didn't kick it.
I fell over it.

619
04:35:04,444 --> 04:35:06,844
I don't believe in
kicking a man when he's down.

620
04:35:07,547 --> 04:35:11,506
Honey, it is not Earl in the box.
It's just his clothes.

621
04:35:11,584 --> 04:35:13,745
Clothes make the man.

622
04:35:15,288 --> 04:35:17,813
You know something, honey? You ought to
spruce yourself up a little.

623
04:35:17,891 --> 04:35:21,520
You are a good-looking man.
You should put your best foot forward.

624
04:35:21,594 --> 04:35:23,562
I know how I look.

625
04:35:23,630 --> 04:35:25,757
I look like a bum.

626
04:35:25,832 --> 04:35:28,062
- A am a bum.
- You're not a bum.

627
04:35:28,134 --> 04:35:32,127
If you took more pains in appearance,
you could get a job you really liked.

628
04:35:32,205 --> 04:35:35,333
The job I really like
hasn't been invented.

629
04:35:35,408 --> 04:35:37,672
You're handsome.
You are.

630
04:35:37,744 --> 04:35:39,541
All you need
is a little more flair.

631
04:35:39,612 --> 04:35:41,477
Flair?

632
04:35:45,218 --> 04:35:46,810
Come here.

633
04:35:49,022 --> 04:35:50,853
Try this on.

634
04:35:50,924 --> 04:35:52,721
- Oh, no.
- Go on. Try this on.

635
04:35:52,792 --> 04:35:53,986
- I don't want to try that on.
- Why not?

636
04:35:54,060 --> 04:35:56,187
I don't want to try it on.
It belongs to Earl.

637
04:35:56,262 --> 04:35:58,196
Earl would understand.

638
04:35:58,264 --> 04:36:01,495
Come on, now. He's
the kindest-hearted man in the world.

639
04:36:01,568 --> 04:36:03,900
For me?

640
04:36:03,970 --> 04:36:05,267
Honey?

641
04:36:15,782 --> 04:36:17,875
Get over there.

642
04:36:57,657 --> 04:37:01,024
What do you think?
Have I got flair now?

643
04:37:04,297 --> 04:37:07,391
- What's the matter?
- Poor bastard.

644
04:37:07,467 --> 04:37:10,766
- Who?
- Earl.

645
04:37:10,837 --> 04:37:13,101
Eating his heart out
in the pokey.

646
04:38:01,621 --> 04:38:03,054
Oh, boy.

647
04:38:04,958 --> 04:38:08,189
I'm in worse shape
than I thought I was.

648
04:38:08,261 --> 04:38:10,354
How long before a man
gets used to this?

649
04:38:10,430 --> 04:38:14,526
I've been doing it for 25 years
and ain't got used to it yet.

650
04:38:17,670 --> 04:38:21,367
All a man needs is a woman
with a good job.

651
04:38:21,441 --> 04:38:24,103
I had that. She left.

652
04:38:24,177 --> 04:38:26,475
I got one now
that won't work at all.

653
04:38:26,546 --> 04:38:28,844
That's the easiest kind to get.

654
04:38:28,915 --> 04:38:31,907
I had a good woman once,
but she divorced me.

655
04:38:31,985 --> 04:38:34,476
- How come?
- Because of wine.

656
04:38:34,554 --> 04:38:36,852
- Wine?
- Uh-huh.

657
04:38:36,923 --> 04:38:40,689
My wife would go to work
and I'd sit home and drink wine.

658
04:38:40,760 --> 04:38:42,853
There was this girl that lived
across the hall.

659
04:38:42,929 --> 04:38:46,296
She was a friend of my wife.

660
04:38:46,366 --> 04:38:49,335
My door would be open,
and I'd see her walk by.

661
04:38:49,402 --> 04:38:51,632
I asked if she wanted a drink.

662
04:38:51,704 --> 04:38:53,934
So we started drinking together...

663
04:38:54,007 --> 04:38:56,805
and she looking better and better...

664
04:38:56,876 --> 04:38:59,470
until I'm over there
as soon as my wife leaves...

665
04:38:59,545 --> 04:39:02,275
and coming back
just before she gets home.

666
04:39:02,348 --> 04:39:05,146
So my wife figures something's up...

667
04:39:05,218 --> 04:39:09,211
'cause I'm all the time yawning
and fall asleep as soon as I get in bed.

668
04:39:10,223 --> 04:39:14,159
So she goes across the hall
and sees this girl...

669
04:39:14,227 --> 04:39:17,424
and a big bunch of roses
in a jar.

670
04:39:17,497 --> 04:39:21,228
So she asks this girl,
"Where'd you get these roses?"

671
04:39:21,300 --> 04:39:24,758
That girl, she say, "I don't know.
They just come."

672
04:39:25,538 --> 04:39:28,439
So my wife go down to the corner
to the florist...

673
04:39:28,508 --> 04:39:31,136
and asked did I buy
a big bunch of red roses.

674
04:39:31,944 --> 04:39:34,208
So he said, "Yes."

675
04:39:34,280 --> 04:39:36,271
That's how wine broke up my marriage.

676
04:39:37,417 --> 04:39:41,114
- Sounds like it was roses to me.
- It was wine and roses.

677
04:39:41,187 --> 04:39:43,951
So now I'm out here
chopping weeds.

678
04:39:45,024 --> 04:39:47,356
I'll tell you girls something.

679
04:39:47,427 --> 04:39:50,419
- Esteban here...
- Can I have a match?

680
04:39:50,496 --> 04:39:52,862
Esteban here
is one hell of a fighter.

681
04:39:52,932 --> 04:39:55,924
Could've made champ,
except for his hands.

682
04:39:56,002 --> 04:40:00,098
Show them your hands. He hits
too hard for the size of his hands.

683
04:40:00,173 --> 04:40:03,631
You know what happened to me?
Mismanagement.

684
04:40:03,709 --> 04:40:06,041
Ruben.

685
04:40:06,112 --> 04:40:08,410
Remember my fight with Soto?

686
04:40:08,481 --> 04:40:10,472
To save a lousy
couple of hundred bucks...

687
04:40:10,550 --> 04:40:13,747
he flew me down to Panama
all by myself and blew my chance.

688
04:40:13,820 --> 04:40:16,880
- You know who Soto was then?
- Number five. He was good boy.

689
04:40:16,956 --> 04:40:20,892
Good? I had that bum hanging on.
I was knocking him silly for six rounds.

690
04:40:20,960 --> 04:40:22,894
So I'm back in my corner.

691
04:40:22,962 --> 04:40:24,953
I'm not paying attention
to anything they're doing to me.

692
04:40:25,031 --> 04:40:27,761
I know I got him. The bell rings.
I come out in the seventh.

693
04:40:27,834 --> 04:40:30,564
He pops me a couple of times, and
suddenly the referee stops the fight.

694
04:40:30,636 --> 04:40:32,570
There's blood pouring down me.
Can you believe that?

695
04:40:32,638 --> 04:40:35,573
Both of my eyes are cut.
Everybody's happy.

696
04:40:35,641 --> 04:40:38,735
The audience is screaming
their heads off.

697
04:40:38,811 --> 04:40:42,440
So they patch me up
and put me on a plane...

698
04:40:42,515 --> 04:40:44,449
and they're all smiles.

699
04:40:47,120 --> 04:40:49,884
I get back to Stockton. I go see Ruben.
He looks at the butterflies.

700
04:40:49,956 --> 04:40:53,153
He takes them off.
He takes a peek at the cuts...

701
04:40:53,226 --> 04:40:55,694
tells me they were done
with a razor.

702
04:40:55,761 --> 04:40:57,786
- Were they?
- They sure were.

703
04:40:57,864 --> 04:41:00,594
- How could he tell?
- By looking at them!

704
04:41:01,667 --> 04:41:05,398
Then we went out of Sacramento and filed
a complaint with the commissioner.

705
04:41:06,906 --> 04:41:08,840
- What happened?
- Nothing.

706
04:41:09,909 --> 04:41:11,706
I'm gonna start doing some running.

707
04:41:13,112 --> 04:41:16,081
If I get into shape,
I know I can still fight.

708
04:41:16,149 --> 04:41:18,515
- Why don't you then?
- I'm gonna.

709
04:41:18,584 --> 04:41:20,677
Yeah, sure.
I heard that one before.

710
04:41:20,753 --> 04:41:23,085
- I am.
- Sure, sure.

711
04:41:23,156 --> 04:41:25,954
- Screw you.
- Up yours, cowboy!

712
04:41:40,873 --> 04:41:42,807
Onion choppers, over here.

713
04:41:47,380 --> 04:41:49,314
Onion choppers, over here.

714
04:41:54,587 --> 04:41:56,578
How the hell are you?

715
04:41:56,656 --> 04:41:59,591
- What are you doing out here?
- Got a bum-paying job. Wife's pregnant.

716
04:41:59,659 --> 04:42:02,856
I came down to pick up a few extra
bucks, and I run into a mob like this.

717
04:42:02,929 --> 04:42:05,090
Come on.
I'll try to get you on.

718
04:42:05,164 --> 04:42:07,132
- Beautiful.
- You like walnuts?

719
04:42:07,200 --> 04:42:11,034
- Yeah, they're great.
- Did you go to the gym and see Ruben?

720
04:42:11,103 --> 04:42:14,630
- Yeah. Fought for a while.
- Yeah? How'd you do?

721
04:42:14,707 --> 04:42:17,403
- I won some, lost some.
- That's good.

722
04:42:17,476 --> 04:42:20,070
Keep it up, man.
You got the stuff.

723
04:42:20,146 --> 04:42:22,808
- Hey, I brought you a real hustler.
- You go out yesterday?

724
04:42:22,882 --> 04:42:26,079
Yeah. I was a tree-beater.

725
04:42:26,152 --> 04:42:28,586
I'll wait and see if all of
yesterday's crew comes back.

726
04:42:28,654 --> 04:42:30,781
You're making a big mistake
if you pass this guy up.

727
04:42:30,856 --> 04:42:34,417
- I'll give you my personal voucher.
- Get on, both of you.

728
04:43:09,362 --> 04:43:13,128
You must think I'm crazy working
out here like this, wasting my time.

729
04:43:13,199 --> 04:43:16,760
It's almost as good as roadwork
for getting back into shape...

730
04:43:16,836 --> 04:43:18,770
and you get paid for it.

731
04:43:21,274 --> 04:43:23,208
Another couple weeks
I'm gonna look for a fight.

732
04:43:24,010 --> 04:43:28,879
I get the fight, I get the money,
and I send for my wife.

733
04:43:31,417 --> 04:43:33,351
You know, Ernie...

734
04:43:34,754 --> 04:43:38,850
there are some women
that love you for yourself...

735
04:43:40,092 --> 04:43:42,356
but that doesn't last long.

736
04:43:52,538 --> 04:43:55,598
- Take care of that wife of yours.
- I'm trying.

737
04:43:55,675 --> 04:43:58,906
And listen, don't you let
anybody knock marriage.

738
04:43:58,978 --> 04:44:01,003
No, man.
It's got its compensations.

739
04:44:01,080 --> 04:44:03,275
That's a fact.
That's absolutely right.

740
04:44:03,349 --> 04:44:07,115
It's got its compensations.
That's it. That's absolutely it.

741
04:44:07,186 --> 04:44:10,178
It has got its compensations.
That's right.

742
04:44:11,123 --> 04:44:13,057
Come here.
Let me show you something.

743
04:44:17,430 --> 04:44:19,295
That's stacked.

744
04:44:19,365 --> 04:44:23,199
I gotta get myself together and get
down to the gym and start working out.

745
04:44:24,537 --> 04:44:27,404
Hey, maybe we could go down
to the gym together.

746
04:44:27,473 --> 04:44:31,637
- Sure, I'll go down there with you.
- I was in bad shape the last time.

747
04:44:31,711 --> 04:44:35,203
I can do it.
I can get back into shape.

748
04:44:35,281 --> 04:44:37,215
You should've seen
the things we had...

749
04:44:37,283 --> 04:44:39,683
the new car and the house
and everything.

750
04:44:39,752 --> 04:44:42,277
I am gonna be bad news
this time around.

751
04:44:42,355 --> 04:44:44,516
Bad...

752
04:44:44,590 --> 04:44:46,421
news!

753
04:44:49,662 --> 04:44:51,596
Time. Time.

754
04:44:51,664 --> 04:44:54,792
You're not jabbing right.
You gotta use your jab more.

755
04:44:54,867 --> 04:44:57,062
Hey, fellas.

756
04:44:57,136 --> 04:44:59,070
Hey, Gil.
How you doing?

757
04:45:00,740 --> 04:45:03,368
Hey, Ruben, look who's here.

758
04:45:05,945 --> 04:45:08,311
Well, will you look at this?

759
04:45:08,381 --> 04:45:11,043
Glad to see you.

760
04:45:11,117 --> 04:45:13,051
You're looking good.

761
04:45:14,820 --> 04:45:16,879
Hey, Ruben, how's it going?

762
04:45:18,257 --> 04:45:20,589
- Will you look at this?
- Hey, how are you?

763
04:45:20,659 --> 04:45:23,685
- Long time, no see.
- How'd you guys find your way up here?

764
04:45:23,763 --> 04:45:26,857
- What have you been doing?
- Picking nuts.

765
04:45:26,932 --> 04:45:29,526
You don't care what kind of company
you keep, do you?

766
04:45:29,602 --> 04:45:32,833
- I heard you got married.
- Yeah.

767
04:45:32,905 --> 04:45:36,568
Wow! How do you like that?
Come on. Time.

768
04:45:36,642 --> 04:45:39,270
Listen, I wanna pay you back
that $20 I borrowed from you.

769
04:45:39,345 --> 04:45:40,937
What?

770
04:45:41,013 --> 04:45:43,072
I borrowed $20 from you.
Remember?

771
04:45:43,149 --> 04:45:46,380
- Yeah, but that was a long time ago.
- I know, but I want you to take it.

772
04:45:48,087 --> 04:45:50,021
Yeah? You sure you can spare it?

773
04:45:50,089 --> 04:45:51,522
Oh, yeah.

774
04:45:52,958 --> 04:45:55,654
You come up to work out?

775
04:45:55,728 --> 04:45:58,219
I wanna start fighting again.

776
04:45:58,297 --> 04:46:00,663
You really gonna get into shape?

777
04:46:00,733 --> 04:46:02,701
I am really gonna get in shape.

778
04:46:02,768 --> 04:46:04,702
You can do it, baby.
You can do it.

779
04:46:04,770 --> 04:46:06,704
You're really looking good.
You look great.

780
04:46:06,772 --> 04:46:09,707
Get into your gym clothes.
Give me that.

781
04:46:19,318 --> 04:46:23,652
Mac, how are you? How's business?
I got something hot for you.

782
04:46:23,722 --> 04:46:25,849
Billy Tully's back in training.

783
04:46:25,925 --> 04:46:28,393
I'll tell you what I'd like for him,
a good tune-up fight.

784
04:46:29,728 --> 04:46:33,186
- Who'd pay to see a tune-up fight?
- He looks terrific, Mac.

785
04:46:33,265 --> 04:46:35,699
A couple of good wins,
he's ready for anybody.

786
04:46:35,768 --> 04:46:40,535
I don't mean match him with some bum.
Somebody to give him a good workout.

787
04:46:40,606 --> 04:46:43,166
- Tully won't draw.
- He's a good, clean athlete...

788
04:46:43,242 --> 04:46:45,176
with a fine record.

789
04:46:45,244 --> 04:46:47,212
Maybe I could use him
in a semi-windup.

790
04:46:47,279 --> 04:46:50,146
A semi-windup.
No, I can't put him in a semi.

791
04:46:50,216 --> 04:46:52,946
He's still got the old stuff.
He's got class.

792
04:46:53,018 --> 04:46:54,952
- He won't draw.
- Look...

793
04:46:55,020 --> 04:46:56,954
we can put a hometown boy
in every bout.

794
04:46:57,022 --> 04:47:01,482
I got a fine Irish kid
that could turn pro for the opener.

795
04:47:01,560 --> 04:47:04,961
How about Arcadio Lucero? I could
use Tully in a main even with him.

796
04:47:05,030 --> 04:47:07,555
No, Lucero... I don't know.

797
04:47:07,633 --> 04:47:10,727
Lucero's a puncher.
What I meant was a good tune-up.

798
04:47:10,803 --> 04:47:12,828
Why should I put him in with Lucero?

799
04:47:12,905 --> 04:47:15,567
It might be different if he had
a couple of good tune-ups first.

800
04:47:16,642 --> 04:47:19,270
I think I can get you Lucero.

801
04:47:19,345 --> 04:47:22,280
Not that I think
he could ever nail Tully.

802
04:47:22,348 --> 04:47:24,908
Well, I tell you,
I think I can get Lucero.

803
04:47:26,585 --> 04:47:28,985
It would be a good win on his record.

804
04:47:29,054 --> 04:47:32,182
I could phone Mexico City
and see if he's available.

805
04:47:41,734 --> 04:47:43,668
Supper's almost ready.

806
04:47:52,945 --> 04:47:54,913
Can I have a robe?

807
04:47:54,980 --> 04:47:56,242
What?

808
04:47:56,315 --> 04:47:58,249
Can I have a robe?

809
04:48:06,258 --> 04:48:08,021
How do you like your steak?

810
04:48:09,762 --> 04:48:11,195
I don't care.

811
04:48:31,350 --> 04:48:33,511
Is Earl out of the bucket?

812
04:48:33,586 --> 04:48:37,283
- His box is gone.
- Earl's box?

813
04:48:37,356 --> 04:48:39,847
- Did Earl come over here today?
- Yep.

814
04:48:39,925 --> 04:48:43,554
- Why didn't you tell me so?
- I just woke up.

815
04:48:43,629 --> 04:48:45,563
I didn't have a chance
to open my mouth.

816
04:48:45,631 --> 04:48:48,361
- Yeah.
- He just picked up his stuff and left.

817
04:48:48,434 --> 04:48:51,562
Mm-hmm. After he found out
he couldn't move back in, huh?

818
04:48:51,637 --> 04:48:53,662
He didn't mention moving in.

819
04:48:55,107 --> 04:48:59,703
- Then why'd he come over?
- I told you, to get his clothes.

820
04:48:59,778 --> 04:49:02,212
He already knew
that you and I were together.

821
04:49:02,281 --> 04:49:05,114
- How'd he know that?
- What are all these questions?

822
04:49:05,184 --> 04:49:07,118
He came by the day he got out.

823
04:49:09,722 --> 04:49:12,384
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I guess I forgot.

824
04:49:13,325 --> 04:49:15,293
- Yeah, that's a good one.
- What?

825
04:49:15,361 --> 04:49:17,386
- Nothing.
- I heard what you said.

826
04:49:17,463 --> 04:49:18,725
They why'd you ask?

827
04:49:20,432 --> 04:49:22,423
You don't trust me, do you?

828
04:49:22,501 --> 04:49:25,436
Look, Oma, all I'm trying to do
is cook our supper.

829
04:49:25,504 --> 04:49:28,268
Oh, aren't you wonderful?

830
04:49:30,709 --> 04:49:33,542
If I didn't cook it,
we wouldn't eat.

831
04:49:33,612 --> 04:49:36,240
Nobody asked you
to fix me any supper.

832
04:49:36,315 --> 04:49:38,249
Yeah, I know.
You'd just as soon drink yours.

833
04:49:38,317 --> 04:49:41,878
If you don't wanna fix me any,
than you don't have to.

834
04:49:41,954 --> 04:49:43,888
I'm making it for you.

835
04:49:46,191 --> 04:49:48,591
Then I won't eat it
if you feel that way about it.

836
04:49:48,661 --> 04:49:50,856
I want you to eat it.

837
04:49:50,929 --> 04:49:53,454
I cooked it
because I want you to eat!

838
04:49:55,000 --> 04:49:58,697
I didn't say anything,
and you had to go and get mad.

839
04:49:58,771 --> 04:50:02,537
Jesus Christ, Oma. Come on.
Eat your supper before it gets cold.

840
04:50:04,710 --> 04:50:07,338
I don't take orders from you.

841
04:50:11,183 --> 04:50:13,151
You need your protein.

842
04:50:13,218 --> 04:50:16,949
I'm not gonna eat with somebody
that talks to me the way you do.

843
04:50:17,022 --> 04:50:19,047
You wanna starve to death?

844
04:50:19,825 --> 04:50:22,316
That'd solve everything
for you, wouldn't it?

845
04:50:24,730 --> 04:50:28,166
Oma, I just asked you
a simple question. Jesus.

846
04:50:28,233 --> 04:50:31,168
Come on.
Eat your dinner before it gets cold.

847
04:50:32,971 --> 04:50:34,802
Maybe I don't wanna eat.

848
04:50:36,875 --> 04:50:39,105
All right. Forget it.
Just forget it.

849
04:50:39,178 --> 04:50:41,908
Go on.
Go hungry if you want to.

850
04:50:41,980 --> 04:50:43,971
I make you a good dinner.
You don't even appreciate it.

851
04:50:45,084 --> 04:50:47,450
This is good food.

852
04:50:47,519 --> 04:50:51,455
Go ahead and starve to death.
See if I care. Just forget about it.

853
04:50:53,492 --> 04:50:56,222
All right.
I'll have a little.

854
04:50:56,295 --> 04:50:58,263
- No, I don't want you to.
- No, I want it.

855
04:50:58,330 --> 04:51:00,264
- I don't want you to eat.
- I wanna eat it.

856
04:51:00,332 --> 04:51:02,266
- No, I don't want you to eat it.
- I want it!

857
04:51:02,334 --> 04:51:04,268
I don't want you to eat it!
I don't want you to eat it!

858
04:51:04,336 --> 04:51:06,804
Now you won't even
let me eat my dinner!

859
04:51:10,709 --> 04:51:12,142
All right.

860
04:51:15,447 --> 04:51:16,880
Eat.

861
04:51:46,945 --> 04:51:48,378
Well?

862
04:51:49,882 --> 04:51:51,816
- How do you like it?
- What?

863
04:51:53,786 --> 04:51:56,653
- Nothing. Forget it.
- Oh, for Christ's sake.

864
04:51:56,722 --> 04:51:59,020
Don't ask something
and then not say what you mean.

865
04:51:59,091 --> 04:52:02,026
- Your supper.
- All right.

866
04:52:02,094 --> 04:52:03,686
It's fine.

867
04:52:05,931 --> 04:52:09,867
I thought you'd know what I meant since
you're not having any trouble eating it.

868
04:52:09,935 --> 04:52:12,768
Nobody can eat with you
sitting across the table!

869
04:52:18,977 --> 04:52:20,911
All right, Oma.

870
04:52:22,014 --> 04:52:23,606
I give up.

871
04:52:24,783 --> 04:52:27,911
All I've been trying to do
is get you to eat your supper.

872
04:52:29,388 --> 04:52:33,984
If you don't want my company,
just say so. I'll let you alone.

873
04:52:34,059 --> 04:52:36,755
- Where you going?
- Take a walk around the block.

874
04:52:36,829 --> 04:52:39,662
- Can I go with you?
- No.

875
04:52:39,731 --> 04:52:41,926
Let you eat in peace.
That's what you want.

876
04:52:42,000 --> 04:52:44,093
You're going out for a drink
and you're gonna leave me here?

877
04:52:44,169 --> 04:52:46,103
I'm fighting in a week.
Do you think I'd take a drink?

878
04:52:46,171 --> 04:52:48,105
Wait a minute.
Let me get my shoes.

879
04:52:48,173 --> 04:52:50,903
Billy, wait...
Billy, wait, please!

880
04:53:01,620 --> 04:53:04,282
- Hello.
<i>- Is that you, Ruben?</i>

881
04:53:04,356 --> 04:53:07,086
- Who is this speaking?
<i>- You know something?</i>

882
04:53:07,159 --> 04:53:10,925
<i>You're not worried about me,</i>
<i>and I don't give a damn about you.</i>

883
04:53:10,996 --> 04:53:14,295
<i>You never will give a damn,</i>
<i>so why should I?</i>

884
04:53:14,366 --> 04:53:18,962
<i>You know, if you'd gone to Panama</i>
<i>with me, everything would be different.</i>

885
04:53:19,037 --> 04:53:21,028
Listen, where are you?
What's the problem?

886
04:53:21,106 --> 04:53:24,564
<i>What do you mean, what is the problem?</i>
<i>What's your problem?</i>

887
04:53:24,643 --> 04:53:27,043
Just hold on. Where are you?
What's wrong?

888
04:53:46,732 --> 04:53:48,666
Hi, Billy.

889
04:53:52,137 --> 04:53:53,570
Hello, Ruben.

890
04:53:53,639 --> 04:53:56,199
What are you doing
out on the town?

891
04:53:56,275 --> 04:53:58,209
Hey, Ruben,
can I buy you a drink?

892
04:53:58,277 --> 04:54:01,769
No, nothing, Billy. Nothing.

893
04:54:01,847 --> 04:54:04,782
Hey, Ruben,
I'm really glad to see you.

894
04:54:04,850 --> 04:54:07,478
I need somebody to talk to.
I need your good advice.

895
04:54:07,552 --> 04:54:09,782
I am in a mess.

896
04:54:09,855 --> 04:54:11,789
What's the trouble?

897
04:54:11,857 --> 04:54:15,793
Oh, this woman of mine,
she's just off her gourd.

898
04:54:15,861 --> 04:54:19,957
I can't take it anymore. I need my
peace of mind. I'm training for a fight.

899
04:54:20,032 --> 04:54:23,559
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

900
04:54:23,635 --> 04:54:27,628
I can't take it anymore, Ruben.

901
04:54:27,706 --> 04:54:30,436
I can't even sleep
in the same bed with her.

902
04:54:30,509 --> 04:54:35,173
Every time she opens her mouth
I think I'm gonna go crazy!

903
04:54:37,516 --> 04:54:41,247
- She's a lush.
- Leave her. Stay at my place tonight.

904
04:54:41,320 --> 04:54:44,414
I wish I could. It's not that easy.
All my clothes are over there.

905
04:54:44,489 --> 04:54:46,821
I'll get you some clothes,
and I'll give you an advance.

906
04:54:46,892 --> 04:54:49,417
But if you're really gonna leave her,
you leave her right now.

907
04:54:50,195 --> 04:54:51,787
Right now!

908
04:54:55,334 --> 04:54:58,132
Right. You're dead right.

909
04:54:58,203 --> 04:55:00,137
- You're right. I know you're right.
- Come on.

910
04:55:00,205 --> 04:55:02,639
Come on. I'll get you a room
somewhere tomorrow.

911
04:55:02,708 --> 04:55:04,608
All right.

912
04:55:04,676 --> 04:55:07,975
She's just destroying me, Rube.

913
04:55:08,046 --> 04:55:10,071
Hey, listen to me.
Wait a minute.

914
04:55:10,148 --> 04:55:12,082
I wanna tell you something.

915
04:55:15,454 --> 04:55:18,514
Ever since my wife left me...

916
04:55:18,590 --> 04:55:22,617
it has just been one mess
after another.

917
04:55:25,330 --> 04:55:26,922
You know...

918
04:55:28,000 --> 04:55:31,265
the only time
I was ever really happy, I...

919
04:55:35,173 --> 04:55:39,234
You know something, Rube?
In four days, I'm gonna be 30.

920
04:55:40,645 --> 04:55:42,579
Come on, let's go.

921
04:55:42,647 --> 04:55:44,979
All right. Okay.

922
04:55:45,050 --> 04:55:47,985
Come on. Attaboy. All right.

923
04:55:48,053 --> 04:55:49,987
You need help?
Okay, baby.

924
04:55:50,055 --> 04:55:51,647
Come on.

925
04:55:53,425 --> 04:55:55,859
You know,
I really appreciate it, Rube.

926
04:55:57,095 --> 04:55:59,029
<i>Lodi and Sacramento.</i>

927
04:56:11,009 --> 04:56:16,037
<i>The Lodi-Sacramento bus</i>
<i>is now loading passengers.</i>

928
04:56:16,114 --> 04:56:18,412
<i>Please remain inside the terminal...</i>

929
04:56:18,483 --> 04:56:23,182
<i>until the driver picks up your ticket</i>
<i>at door number four.</i>

930
04:56:23,255 --> 04:56:25,450
<i>Have a pleasant day.</i>

931
04:57:23,315 --> 04:57:25,943
Billy, better start to warm up.

932
04:57:26,017 --> 04:57:28,884
- Hurry up. He's gotta warm up.
- You're on right now.

933
04:57:28,954 --> 04:57:31,718
Don't get excited, Mac.

934
04:57:31,790 --> 04:57:34,054
- How do you feel, Tully?
- I feel okay.

935
04:57:34,126 --> 04:57:36,720
- Is he all clear from the doctor?
- He's all set. He's gonna win big.

936
04:57:36,795 --> 04:57:39,025
- How's the crowd?
- Fair.

937
04:57:39,097 --> 04:57:42,032
- You're on next, so good luck, Tully.
- Thanks, Mac.

938
04:57:46,738 --> 04:57:49,969
You all ready to go, Lucero?
Gonna give them another good show?

939
04:57:55,147 --> 04:57:57,138
He feels good. He's ready.

940
04:57:57,215 --> 04:58:00,013
- He seen the doctor yet?
- Yeah. He says he's in good shape.

941
04:58:00,085 --> 04:58:02,178
You got some fans out there, Lucero.

942
04:58:02,254 --> 04:58:04,745
Give them a good show.
I'd like to have you back here.

943
04:58:23,975 --> 04:58:26,671
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.

944
04:58:26,745 --> 04:58:29,270
The main event.
Ten rounds.

945
04:58:29,347 --> 04:58:31,281
Wearing the blue trunks...

946
04:58:31,349 --> 04:58:35,285
weighing 175 pounds...

947
04:58:35,353 --> 04:58:37,787
the pride of Stockton...

948
04:58:37,856 --> 04:58:40,256
Billy Tully!

949
04:58:41,726 --> 04:58:44,559
And from Mexico City...

950
04:58:44,629 --> 04:58:47,120
Arcadio Lucero!

951
04:58:49,668 --> 04:58:54,105
And the referee for the main event,
Al Giovanni.

952
04:59:29,374 --> 04:59:33,208
Come on, come on! Hit him in
the head! The head! Hit him!

953
05:00:10,548 --> 05:00:13,381
Break. Come on, boys.

954
05:00:18,790 --> 05:00:20,382
Break. Break.

955
05:00:26,965 --> 05:00:28,899
Go back to the corners.

956
05:00:36,641 --> 05:00:39,906
Stay away from him. Move him around.
Don't slug with him.

957
05:00:39,978 --> 05:00:42,446
- He's laying for you.
- He's weak downstairs.

958
05:00:47,986 --> 05:00:50,716
- Don't trade with him.
- I hurt him downstairs.

959
05:00:50,789 --> 05:00:52,484
Don't gamble.

960
05:00:52,557 --> 05:00:54,491
- Seconds out.
- Get him up.

961
05:00:55,627 --> 05:00:57,424
Seconds out.

962
05:01:35,734 --> 05:01:38,134
Break. Step back. Step back.

963
05:02:02,594 --> 05:02:06,325
- Stay down, Billy!
- One, two, three...

964
05:02:06,398 --> 05:02:07,990
- Stay down, Billy!
- four...

965
05:02:08,066 --> 05:02:10,432
five, six...

966
05:02:10,502 --> 05:02:13,699
- seven, eight...
- Get up, Billy!

967
05:02:13,772 --> 05:02:15,364
Get up!

968
05:02:16,741 --> 05:02:19,209
Are you all right, kid?

969
05:02:19,277 --> 05:02:21,211
All right.
Come on, let's go!

970
05:02:33,925 --> 05:02:36,086
Right here. Come on, kid.
Let's go.

971
05:02:36,161 --> 05:02:38,095
Come on, sit down.

972
05:02:45,003 --> 05:02:48,063
- Is that eye all right?
- Yeah, he's all right.

973
05:02:48,139 --> 05:02:50,073
- Make sure.
- He's okay.

974
05:02:52,110 --> 05:02:55,409
Tully, stay away from him.
Stay away from those rights.

975
05:02:55,480 --> 05:02:58,711
Tie him up.
Stick him in the ribs, okay?

976
05:02:58,783 --> 05:03:00,851
- All right. Seconds out.
- Seconds out.

977
05:03:00,886 --> 05:03:02,919
- All right. Seconds out.
- Seconds out.

978
05:03:02,987 --> 05:03:06,218
Move! Move!
Move, baby, move!

979
05:03:16,768 --> 05:03:19,134
Come on.
Clean break. Clean break.

980
05:03:38,623 --> 05:03:40,557
Break. Come on, boys.

981
05:04:33,478 --> 05:04:35,469
Break. Break.

982
05:04:35,547 --> 05:04:37,139
Move. Move.

983
05:05:03,641 --> 05:05:08,601
Five, six, seven, eight...

984
05:05:08,680 --> 05:05:10,614
You all right, kid?

985
05:05:27,932 --> 05:05:30,730
Winner by technical knockout...

986
05:05:30,802 --> 05:05:35,239
time: two minutes and thirteen seconds
of the third round...

987
05:05:35,306 --> 05:05:37,968
Billy Tully!

988
05:05:45,516 --> 05:05:48,110
- Did I get knocked out?
- No, we won, we won.

989
05:05:48,186 --> 05:05:50,518
You won, baby! You won!

990
05:06:10,541 --> 05:06:12,736
Here he is!

991
05:06:12,810 --> 05:06:14,744
There he is.

992
05:06:16,381 --> 05:06:19,043
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations, Billy.

993
05:06:19,117 --> 05:06:21,142
Kiss him, honey. Kiss him.

994
05:06:21,219 --> 05:06:23,881
- Congratulations.
- You put on a good fight.

995
05:06:23,955 --> 05:06:26,685
Good fight?
This guy is sensational.

996
05:06:26,758 --> 05:06:29,818
He just pulled the upset of the year.
This guy is great.

997
05:06:29,894 --> 05:06:32,692
I defy anybody to say
this guy is not great.

998
05:06:32,764 --> 05:06:35,995
First fight in two years,
he gets himself into perfect condition.

999
05:06:36,067 --> 05:06:38,592
He doesn't smoke, Mac. You know that?
Never touches tobacco.

1000
05:06:38,670 --> 05:06:41,867
He's ready for anybody.
We got a real winner here.

1001
05:06:41,939 --> 05:06:44,931
He's the most colorful attraction
in Northern California.

1002
05:06:45,009 --> 05:06:47,978
What'd you think of this kid?
Wasn't he fantastic?

1003
05:06:48,046 --> 05:06:50,640
First pro fight,
he's cool as ice in there.

1004
05:06:52,884 --> 05:06:55,614
Don't give it all
to them baby doctors.

1005
05:06:55,687 --> 05:06:58,155
If it's a boy, call him Babe.

1006
05:06:58,222 --> 05:07:00,816
- How can he miss?
- Real good. Real good.

1007
05:07:00,892 --> 05:07:03,383
- Is he a lightweight or a heavyweight?
- A heavyweight.

1008
05:07:03,461 --> 05:07:05,861
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night. I'll see you.

1009
05:07:05,930 --> 05:07:08,990
- Good night, kids. Take care.
- See you, Bill.

1010
05:07:09,801 --> 05:07:12,668
Babe, take my missus home, will you?
I'll drop Tully off.

1011
05:07:12,737 --> 05:07:15,035
Come on.

1012
05:07:15,106 --> 05:07:17,597
He looked good out there.
That third round...

1013
05:07:51,476 --> 05:07:54,809
We earned $241.
You've been off too long.

1014
05:07:54,879 --> 05:07:56,813
Next time you'll draw
three times that much.

1015
05:07:56,881 --> 05:08:00,112
- What's my cut come to?
- I gave you all those advances.

1016
05:08:00,184 --> 05:08:03,585
I gotta collect some of that.
We got you on your feet now.

1017
05:08:03,654 --> 05:08:06,054
In three or four weeks
you'll be ready to go again.

1018
05:08:06,124 --> 05:08:09,525
I'll tell you what. Why don't I
just keep paying your room and board?

1019
05:08:09,594 --> 05:08:12,620
- I'm not drinking anymore.
- I know, Billy. I know.

1020
05:08:12,697 --> 05:08:15,325
I'm not gonna blow any of it.

1021
05:08:15,399 --> 05:08:19,392
Look, you take your cut and just
let me pay my own bills, okay?

1022
05:08:19,470 --> 05:08:21,404
Anything you say.

1023
05:08:26,477 --> 05:08:28,411
Here you go.

1024
05:08:32,650 --> 05:08:35,210
Only a hundred bucks?

1025
05:08:35,286 --> 05:08:38,915
That's all my sweat and blood
is worth, a lousy 100 bucks?

1026
05:08:38,990 --> 05:08:40,924
That's hardly worth the trouble.

1027
05:08:40,992 --> 05:08:44,155
I gave you those advances with the
agreement they come out of your purse.

1028
05:08:44,228 --> 05:08:46,958
I got four kids. Once we make
another match, I'll stake you.

1029
05:08:47,031 --> 05:08:48,965
- Oh, yeah.
- Don't get out that door!

1030
05:08:49,033 --> 05:08:50,967
You'll get run over!
Get out this door!

1031
05:08:52,203 --> 05:08:54,535
What'd you do that for?
Why didn't you slide over?

1032
05:08:54,605 --> 05:08:57,438
- What do you care?
- You can get run into out there.

1033
05:08:57,508 --> 05:09:00,602
You're just looking out for me
every minute, aren't you?

1034
05:09:00,678 --> 05:09:02,942
Huh? Except when
it comes time to pay off!

1035
05:09:03,014 --> 05:09:05,915
I'll talk to Mac. He'll put you
on again in two or three weeks.

1036
05:09:05,983 --> 05:09:09,043
- With this cut?
- It'll heal.

1037
05:09:09,120 --> 05:09:11,281
You know where I got this cut, Ruben?

1038
05:09:11,355 --> 05:09:13,721
This is the same place they cut me
with that razor blade...

1039
05:09:13,791 --> 05:09:17,454
when you sent me down to Panama
to fight Soto all by myself...

1040
05:09:17,528 --> 05:09:20,224
'cause you were too tight to
come down and work in my corner.

1041
05:09:20,298 --> 05:09:23,267
That's not old scar tissue.
It's a new cut.

1042
05:09:23,334 --> 05:09:25,268
Yeah, that's what you'd say,
all right.

1043
05:09:25,336 --> 05:09:27,531
Would you get out of
the middle of the road there?

1044
05:09:27,605 --> 05:09:29,197
Yeah, yeah.

1045
05:10:21,559 --> 05:10:22,992
What you want?

1046
05:10:26,631 --> 05:10:30,863
- I just come to get my things.
- I live here, and I pay the rent.

1047
05:10:33,871 --> 05:10:36,271
- Yeah.
- Got your things in a box.

1048
05:10:36,340 --> 05:10:38,274
You're all ready to go.

1049
05:10:40,978 --> 05:10:46,006
Oh, Christ, Mary and Joseph,
look who's here.

1050
05:10:46,083 --> 05:10:49,246
- Thanks.
- I'm wearing one of your T-shirts.

1051
05:10:49,320 --> 05:10:51,914
- I'll take it off for you.
- No, don't bother. I've got plenty.

1052
05:10:51,989 --> 05:10:55,152
I got my own.
Just wasn't none clean today.

1053
05:10:55,226 --> 05:10:57,456
What's yours is yours.

1054
05:10:57,528 --> 05:10:59,462
Oma wanted me
to throw your stuff out...

1055
05:11:00,698 --> 05:11:03,064
but I say a man's stuff
is his stuff.

1056
05:11:03,134 --> 05:11:06,467
When he shows up around here, I'm gonna
send him off with what he come for.

1057
05:11:06,537 --> 05:11:10,098
- You can take that box and shove it!
- Hush now. He just come for his things.

1058
05:11:10,174 --> 05:11:12,642
- He's leaving.
- Don't you hush me, you bums!

1059
05:11:12,710 --> 05:11:14,940
- What do you know about it anyway?
- Don't listen to her.

1060
05:11:15,012 --> 05:11:17,674
- She's been drinking.
- Get that garbage out of here!

1061
05:11:17,748 --> 05:11:20,979
- We've been out on the town tonight.
- Take the shirt off a man's back.

1062
05:11:21,052 --> 05:11:23,384
If that isn't just so perfect!
If that isn't just like him!

1063
05:11:23,454 --> 05:11:27,288
She just likes to blow off steam.
Don't listen to her. We gets along.

1064
05:11:27,358 --> 05:11:29,849
How I handle her,
I just don't pay her no mind.

1065
05:11:29,927 --> 05:11:32,487
The thing you got to understand
about her, she's a juice head.

1066
05:11:32,563 --> 05:11:36,090
I know.
She won't eat either.

1067
05:11:36,167 --> 05:11:39,364
Yeah, that's on account of
her unhappy life and all that shit.

1068
05:11:40,371 --> 05:11:43,898
Nothing I can do about that.
So I don't let it worry me none.

1069
05:11:45,376 --> 05:11:47,776
Look like you had you a fight.
How you come out?

1070
05:11:48,512 --> 05:11:50,446
- I won.
- Is that right?

1071
05:11:50,514 --> 05:11:52,914
I seen you on the posters.

1072
05:11:52,984 --> 05:11:54,918
I like to catch a good fight
now and then.

1073
05:11:54,986 --> 05:11:58,114
- Maybe I'll catch you some time.
- Good.

1074
05:11:58,189 --> 05:12:01,488
But I don't need you coming around
here no more. She don't wanna see you.

1075
05:12:01,559 --> 05:12:04,153
Oma, you wanna see this man?

1076
05:12:05,229 --> 05:12:07,789
- Christ!
- See how it is?

1077
05:12:10,501 --> 05:12:12,435
You got your stuff.

1078
05:12:35,426 --> 05:12:37,758
- You got a match?
- I don't have one.

1079
05:12:54,745 --> 05:12:56,679
- Hey, man.
- Hey, how's it going?

1080
05:12:56,747 --> 05:12:59,773
- All right. How you doing?
- All right.

1081
05:12:59,850 --> 05:13:03,411
- You look like you had a fight.
- Yeah, I just one a decision in Reno.

1082
05:13:03,487 --> 05:13:05,614
Is that right?

1083
05:13:05,689 --> 05:13:08,283
Congratulations. Nice going.

1084
05:13:08,359 --> 05:13:10,884
- Why don't we have a drink?
- No, not for me.

1085
05:13:10,961 --> 05:13:13,429
- How you been keeping, man?
- Come on.

1086
05:13:13,497 --> 05:13:15,761
No, I gotta get home
to my wife and kid.

1087
05:13:15,833 --> 05:13:19,929
What's the matter? You won't even
have a drink with your old buddy.

1088
05:13:20,004 --> 05:13:22,063
But I don't drink.

1089
05:13:22,139 --> 05:13:24,107
Yeah, I know.
You only win decisions.

1090
05:13:24,175 --> 05:13:27,542
Do you know how many KOs
I had in a row?

1091
05:13:27,611 --> 05:13:29,545
A whole long string.

1092
05:13:31,215 --> 05:13:33,445
You mind if I say something personal?

1093
05:13:33,517 --> 05:13:37,351
- No, go ahead.
- Can I be frank?

1094
05:13:37,421 --> 05:13:39,355
It's just my own opinion.

1095
05:13:41,158 --> 05:13:44,559
You remember that first time
that we met down at the YMCA?

1096
05:13:46,297 --> 05:13:47,889
Yeah.

1097
05:13:47,965 --> 05:13:50,695
I said to myself then...
I said...

1098
05:13:52,069 --> 05:13:57,234
"Now, there is a guy
that is soft in the center."

1099
05:14:06,884 --> 05:14:08,818
I don't know. Forget it.

1100
05:14:08,886 --> 05:14:12,185
Great. Fine. Congratulations.

1101
05:14:12,256 --> 05:14:16,158
Listen, you got everything
going for you, you know that?

1102
05:14:16,227 --> 05:14:18,559
You're young, and you got a wife,
and you got a kid...

1103
05:14:18,629 --> 05:14:22,190
- A little boy.
- Yeah, and you got a good reach too.

1104
05:14:25,136 --> 05:14:28,663
- Hey, no hard feelings, huh?
- No, man. No hard feelings.

1105
05:14:28,739 --> 05:14:31,503
You're right about that drink.

1106
05:14:31,575 --> 05:14:34,703
Can I buy you a cup of coffee?

1107
05:14:34,778 --> 05:14:37,042
Yeah, let's go get some coffee.

1108
05:14:39,583 --> 05:14:41,551
So, why haven't you been training?

1109
05:14:41,619 --> 05:14:43,553
Oh, I don't know.

1110
05:14:43,621 --> 05:14:45,555
I've been thinking about it.

1111
05:15:15,119 --> 05:15:16,950
- Coffee?
- Coffee.

1112
05:15:17,021 --> 05:15:18,454
Please.

1113
05:15:30,401 --> 05:15:33,802
How'd you like to
wake up in the morning...

1114
05:15:33,871 --> 05:15:35,805
and be him?

1115
05:15:42,580 --> 05:15:44,013
Jesus.

1116
05:15:45,916 --> 05:15:47,508
The waste.

1117
05:15:52,890 --> 05:15:55,484
Before you can get rolling...

1118
05:15:55,559 --> 05:15:58,585
your life makes a beehive
for the drain.

1119
05:16:06,804 --> 05:16:09,295
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

1120
05:16:15,546 --> 05:16:18,208
Maybe he's happy.

1121
05:16:20,551 --> 05:16:22,485
Maybe we're all happy.

1122
05:16:30,194 --> 05:16:31,627
Right?

1123
05:16:43,340 --> 05:16:45,365
Do you think he was
ever young once?

1124
05:16:48,245 --> 05:16:50,440
No.

1125
05:16:50,514 --> 05:16:52,448
Maybe he was.

1126
05:17:23,047 --> 05:17:25,277
Hey, buddy, I'm gonna take off.

1127
05:17:25,349 --> 05:17:27,374
Hey, stick around.

1128
05:17:27,451 --> 05:17:29,385
Talk a while.
