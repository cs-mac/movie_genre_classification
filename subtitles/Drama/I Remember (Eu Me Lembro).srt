1
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,701
THE WAY HE LOOKS

2
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:31,883
What is your level of laziness
right now?

3
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:38,306
- Six. What about you?
- Eight. And a half.

4
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,599
And a half? All that?

5
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:43,269
The sun, the summer vacation,
this pool. . .

6
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,813
It makes me lazy just to think
it will come to an end.

7
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:50,234
- I'm tired of doing nothing.
- I'm quite happy doing nothing.

8
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:53,362
We never do anything on summer vacation!
Nothing happens.

9
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:57,492
- What do you want to happen?
- I don't know.

10
00:01:57,576 --> 00:02:02,497
But the best dramas and great romances
never happen during our vacation.

11
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,083
Who do you imagine
having this great romance with?

12
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:08,711
You always say there are
only frogs in our class.

13
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,465
Well, it doesn't have to be a prince!

14
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,346
- Don't you worry about this?
- About what?

15
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,390
That you'll go through life
without ever kissing anyone, Leo.

16
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,351
- Giovana!
- It's true!

17
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:27,021
You won't change that by listening
to Beethoven your entire vacation!

18
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,649
You should kiss any girl
and get it over with!

19
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:32,360
Why don't I kiss you, then?

20
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,031
But I don't want my first kiss
to be like that.

21
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,158
You will never kiss anyone, then.

22
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,118
And who would want to kiss me?

23
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,621
I bet that witch Karina
would kiss you.

24
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,837
- You might turn into a frog, though!
- Silly!

25
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,757
She's always checking you out.

26
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:59,178
But it's depressing to think that Karina
is the only one who would kiss me.

27
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,934
Besides, she only talks bullshit.
She's so annoying!

28
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,353
What if we kiss
and she gets stuck on me?

29
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,564
Do you think she's that kind of girl?

30
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:13,776
Giovana? Giovana? Giovana!

31
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:17,530
- Hey! Did you say something?
- Weren't you listening?

32
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,115
No!

33
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,118
Get in the water, Leonardo!
Stop being boring!

34
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,704
No one calls me boring!

35
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,709
Are you sure
you don't want to come in?

36
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,752
No. I still have to organise my stuff.

37
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,881
Give me the keys, Leo!

38
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:49,770
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

39
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:06,954
- Mum. I'm home.
- Hi, Leo! Come and have a snack.

40
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,664
I'm coming.

41
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,235
- So, Leo. How was your day?
- It was good.

42
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,447
- Just good?
- It was cool.

43
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,824
Leo, you're burned.
Did you wear sunscreen?

44
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,369
I did. But the sun was too strong.

45
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:47,995
Are you sure?

46
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,707
C'mon! You know
I hate wearing sunscreen!

47
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:55,419
My skin gets icky.
I'd rather not sunbathe at all!

48
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,922
Good! That's what
will happen next time!

49
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:01,968
- Relax, Mum!
- Relax. Have you packed your things?

50
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:06,430
No, laziness overtook me.
But I'll do it today.

51
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:11,018
- What's up, Leo?
- Hi, Dad!

52
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,691
- Tanned, huh? Where were you?
- At Giovana's.

53
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,569
I saw Giovana the other day
and was surprised.

54
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:24,323
- Why?
- She's grown, she's a woman now.

55
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:25,658
What do you mean, Dad?

56
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,702
A while back, you were just kids.

57
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:30,621
Now you're growing up,
becoming real people.

58
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,916
The chair, Leo!

59
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,043
I must have super powers!

60
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:38,546
I've always done this
and I've never fallen down.

61
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,964
Funny boy!

62
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:42,925
Leo, I've talked to your grandma

63
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,594
and she has a doctor's appointment
this Wednesday. . .

64
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,514
- Fine, I'll come back home.
- You'll be all by yourself.

65
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,975
- So?
- What will you eat?

66
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,895
I'll eat something at the school
cafeteria or I'll make a sandwich.

67
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,982
- No, no. I'd be worried.
- Mum!

68
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,735
What kind of tragedy
could possibly happen?

69
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,905
OK, OK.

70
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:08,451
But you call us as soon as
you step inside the house.

71
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,661
- Alright.
- And keep your phone charged.

72
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:11,787
OK!

73
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:44,153
Elevator going up!

74
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:49,158
- What's so funny, Mr Guilherme?
- It's nothing, teacher.

75
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:53,662
Sorry, but I can't take the pair of you
for another year!

76
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,457
Fabio, please sit at the empty chair
behind Leo.

77
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,626
- Oh, no, teacher!
- Oh, yes, Fabio!

78
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,628
It's impossible to sit behind Leo,

79
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,214
listening to that annoying machine
all day!

80
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:06,509
- You are such a jerk!
- Shut up, you human walking stick!

81
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,260
How can you go so low, Fabio?

82
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,846
I'll show you something lower later,
guide dog!

83
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:15,434
- Shut up, jerk!
- Hey, guys, where do you think you are?

84
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,855
If I sit behind Leo, I'm going to have
to help him out all the time.

85
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,732
He can't do anything on his own!

86
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:25,069
Enough! You won't have to help anyone
at the Principal's office.

87
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,862
Get your stuff.

88
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,572
Gee, teacher! This sucks!

89
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:31,408
Isn't Giovana going
to the Principal's office, too?

90
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,577
Do you want to join him there?

91
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:36,205
- No, thanks.
- Go on, Fabio!

92
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:44,380
- Is this room 21 1 ?
- Yes. What's your name?

93
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,258
- Gabriel.
- Come on in.

94
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,183
Can I sit in that empty seat?

95
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,727
Guys!

96
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,273
It's free. Go sit down.

97
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:05,901
Welcome, Gabriel.

98
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,036
Any more jokes?

99
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,707
- Well?
- No.

100
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,131
The keys, Leo.

101
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,066
- Bye, Gi.
- Bye.

102
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,861
Don't let that jackass Fabio
ruin your day, OK?

103
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,154
OK.

104
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,784
Let me tell you,
this new guy is really cute!

105
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:40,162
Maybe this year
things will be better, right?

106
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:43,874
- Yeah, right!
- Maybe he's my Prince Charming!

107
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,459
C'mon! Get a grip.

108
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,628
He's just arrived.
You don't even know him!

109
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:53,050
- Are you jealous, Leo?
- Yeah, I'm dying of jealousy.

110
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,429
- I can't believe this! What a nerve!
- What is it?

111
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:01,016
- Karina hits on everyone!
- What are you talking about, Gi?

112
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,894
She just sat next to Gabriel
and is flirting with him.

113
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:06,397
It's not enough she hits on you.

114
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,691
The minute a new guy comes,
she goes for it.

115
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:18,617
Very well. Cells can be divided
into two basic types.

116
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,577
Eukaryotic and prokaryotic.

117
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,913
Do you have an eraser I can borrow?

118
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:25,416
Gee. . . I don't use erasers.

119
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,961
- I'm sorry.
- That's OK.

120
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,130
Wait a minute.

121
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,515
- Thanks!
- You're welcome.

122
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,106
If I were Pluto and someone told me,

123
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,569
"Hey, you're not a planet any more,"
I'd be very upset!

124
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,363
Give me the key, Leo.

125
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,999
Here.

126
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,335
- Bye!
- Bye.

127
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,462
- Bye, Leo.
- Bye, Gabriel.

128
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,973
- Well, see you, then.
- Don't you go that way?

129
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:27,061
No, I actually live two blocks back.
I always bring Leo home.

130
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:30,856
- OK. See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

131
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,572
I'm home, Mum.
Safe and sound in my room.

132
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,868
OK. Of course I'm going to eat.

133
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,914
Kisses, Mum. Bye!

134
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,994
Have you ever thought
about doing an exchange programme?

135
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,412
What do you mean?

136
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,832
An exchange programme. Live abroad.

137
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:15,085
Not really, I'm lazy. Why?

138
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,421
I've been thinking about it.

139
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:21,800
- Maybe going to the US.
- Not the States, Leo!

140
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:24,595
France would be nice!
Can you imagine a vacation in Paris?

141
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,722
I'm not talking about vacations.

142
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:32,352
Besides, United States, France,
anywhere is good enough!

143
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,230
I just want to leave!

144
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,900
Why now, Leo?

145
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:43,405
It's not a new thing.
I've been thinking about it for a while.

146
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:47,242
Imagine how cool it'd be to go somewhere
where no one knows you,

147
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,328
where no one knows who you are.

148
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:52,289
You could even create a new personality!

149
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,667
- Don't you like your personality?
- Yes, I do!

150
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,586
I'm not the problem.

151
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,675
Excuse me. Gi.

152
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,552
- Will you stay for dinner?
- Please.

153
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:08,388
- I'll call you guys when it's ready.
- Thank you, Laura.

154
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,270
- What about your mum?
- What about her?

155
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:18,815
- What does she think about this?
- She doesn't know, obviously.

156
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,486
You plan to move to another country
without telling your parents?

157
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,987
Who knows?

158
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,158
You're cuckoo, Leo!

159
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,957
Where's yours?

160
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,125
- At home.
- At home?

161
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,002
- Hey, let's go.
- Let's!

162
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,964
I'm not going with you guys.
I'm having lunch at my grandma's.

163
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:45,968
Yes, today is Wednesday! I'm sorry.
I'm taking Leo to his grandma's, OK?

164
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,345
No, you don't have to. I'll go alone.

165
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,974
- It's so close, I can take you.
- Yeah, it's close, I can go alone.

166
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,601
- Are you sure, Leo?
- I am.

167
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,228
OK, OK. It's up to you.

168
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,277
So, guys, we'll talk later, OK?

169
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:06,697
- Alright. Call me, OK?
- OK.

170
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,409
Hi, Mum.

171
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,869
Yes, I'm at school.

172
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:18,375
I'm going to Grandma's.
I'll let you know when I get there.

173
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,003
Kiss. Bye.

174
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,342
Leo, Leo, are you OK?

175
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,135
Get off me!

176
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:13,889
- Leo, are you OK?
- Yep.

177
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,558
- Are you sure? I can take you. . .
- I'm fine, Karina.

178
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,604
You guys are fucked up, huh?

179
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:52,302
Hello? Hi, Mum. . .
No, nothing yet.

180
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:54,971
Are you sure he didn't tell you
where he was going?

181
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,891
No, Giovana doesn't know either.

182
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:03,438
No, stay there in case he goes back
to your place and there's no one there.

183
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,942
OK, OK. It's better this way.

184
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,737
I'm going to hang up now.
Maybe he'll try to call.

185
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,906
Bye, kisses.

186
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,828
She doesn't know anything.

187
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:25,085
- Leonardo!
- Gee, Mum, what is it?

188
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,420
Where have you been, Leo?

189
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,338
- Around. . .
- Around?

190
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:31,842
How about letting your mother
know you weren't coming home?

191
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:35,011
- Oh, Mum, relax!
- Do you know what time it is?

192
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:36,972
You out there, alone in the dark.

193
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,684
It's always dark for me!
There's no need for all this fuss!

194
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:45,856
- Leo, why didn't you answer your phone?
- Sorry, Mum. It was in my backpack!

195
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,526
And I'm old enough
to not have to explain everything I do!

196
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,279
You still have
a lot of explaining to do!

197
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:56,783
You too, Dad? Can't I take a step
without you watching over me?

198
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,076
Watching over you?

199
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:00,662
You were gone for hours
and want us to be cool about it?

200
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:04,332
Ask anyone in my class if their parents
would freak out over being a bit late.

201
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:08,462
- Leo, you know it's different!
- Why does it have to be different, Mum?

202
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:11,214
Why don't you try to make it normal?

203
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,803
Leonardo, your grandma said
you'd been hurt.

204
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:18,889
It was nothing, Mum!

205
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:21,141
It was just a scratch.
Can I take a shower?

206
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,810
Or do you want to bath me too?

207
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:25,103
- Leonardo!
- Let it be.

208
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:26,688
- Leo?
- Laura!

209
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,450
Hey, guys, how can I help you?

210
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:42,370
I'm interested in doing
an exchange programme

211
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,998
and I wanted more information.

212
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:50,253
OK. So, I need your parents
to come here and talk to us

213
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:53,507
so we can explain
how everything works, OK?

214
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:54,966
OK. Thank you.

215
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,010
So we don't have a wasted visit,

216
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:01,431
could you tell us a little bit
about what we'll need?

217
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:03,683
Do you want to do
an exchange programme too?

218
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:04,935
Yeah, I guess.

219
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,771
OK. I'll get some flyers.

220
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:12,150
That way, when your parents come,
they will be well informed.

221
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:14,110
I'll just be a minute.

222
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,456
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

223
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:30,085
We'll come back with our parents.

224
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,628
- Thanks.
- You're welcome!

225
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,046
One last question. . .

226
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:37,801
Do you think I'd have a problem doing
the exchange programme, being blind?

227
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,179
I'll be honest.

228
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:44,391
We have never had a blind person
go on an exchange programme.

229
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:48,979
But it's only a matter of finding
a family prepared to accommodate you.

230
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,355
Here's an idea.

231
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:56,236
Give me your number and I'll do some
research, then I'll contact you. OK?

232
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:02,284
- What's your number?
- It's 94 837. . . 9.

233
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,497
- So, that's it, kids!
- Thank you.

234
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,916
- You're welcome.
- Come on, Leo.

235
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,342
Would you like anything else?
Dessert? Some coffee?

236
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:20,927
No, thanks, Grandma.

237
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:28,018
Grandma, how old was my mum
when she had me?

238
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:35,025
22. . . 23. She got married young.
You were born right after that.

239
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:42,616
- Did she date anyone before my dad?
- No, he was her first boyfriend.

240
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:46,328
But they got into so much trouble!

241
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,205
She drove your grandpa crazy!

242
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,000
But she only moved out
after getting married?

243
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,418
Yeah.

244
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:54,920
Why?

245
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,589
I was thinking about that.

246
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,592
- About having kids?
- No!

247
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,262
I want to move out.

248
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,850
How do you plan to support yourself?

249
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:12,228
I'll get a job. Everybody works.

250
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:15,690
There's a kid at school who's a waiter
at his father's restaurant.

251
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,318
Isn't it a bit early for that, Leo?

252
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,079
OK. Kisses.

253
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:37,671
- Who was that? A girlfriend?
- It was my dad.

254
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,298
Gee, do your parents worry like Leo's?

255
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:41,800
Hey!

256
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:45,470
Actually, it's just my dad.
My mum died when I was a kid.

257
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:50,558
- So it's just the two of you?
- I've got an older brother, too.

258
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:54,270
- Does he live with you?
- No. He stayed where I used to live.

259
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:57,565
- Do you get along well?
- Sort of. . .

260
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,944
- Why sort of?
- We're very different.

261
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:04,030
He's the engineer type.
Only thinks in terms of numbers.

262
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:08,034
I like to read, he hates it. But when
it comes to music, we are the same.

263
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:11,913
Did you know that Leo
only listens to classical music?

264
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:13,999
Really?

265
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,167
Yeah.

266
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,420
I've always wanted
to like classical music,

267
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,380
but I've never had the patience for it.

268
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,882
Why not? It's the best kind
of music there is!

269
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,801
- Gee, Leo.
- Don't exaggerate.

270
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:28,221
- But it is.
- And why do you like it so much?

271
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:30,724
Because of my grandma Maria.

272
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:34,060
She'd always say
that to understand anything,

273
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:37,313
you first need to start
with the classics.

274
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:41,359
The problem is that Leo started
with the classics and got stuck there!

275
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:42,444
Silly!

276
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:45,530
- You can give me some lessons, Leo.
- OK.

277
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:49,576
That's all I need!
Beethoven and Mozart together.

278
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:54,330
Guys, it's kind of late. I have to go.

279
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,458
- Already?
- I've gotta go, too.

280
00:22:56,542 --> 00:23:00,003
Wait, I'll get changed
and I'll take you home, Leo.

281
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:03,214
If you want, I can take him, so you
don't need to go and come back.

282
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,216
It's not a problem. It's so close.

283
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:06,926
My house is on the way to Gabriel's.

284
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:08,887
- It's easier.
- Yeah, way easier.

285
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:12,474
- It's up to you.
- Let's go, then.

286
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:17,645
It's about an hour and a half from here.

287
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,398
So it's actually relatively close.

288
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,860
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot the step.

289
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:27,697
Don't worry. No problem.
Next time you'll warn me.

290
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:29,949
My bad!

291
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,871
The Hellenic was a period. . .

292
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,007
. .of great expansion.

293
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:52,180
Guys, since we're studying Greece,
I want you to pair up for an assignment.

294
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:56,351
But the pair has to be of boys or girls.

295
00:23:56,435 --> 00:24:00,355
The girls will write about Athens
and the boys about Sparta, OK?

296
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,732
Pair up and give me your names.

297
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,277
Teacher, does it have to be
a pair of two?

298
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,196
Ask the maths teacher.

299
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,324
- Can I be your pair?
- Yes.

300
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,251
Have you seen that video
with the cat getting into the toilet?

301
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,546
- Oh, sorry.
- No problem.

302
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:32,262
Do people ask you
these silly things a lot?

303
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:33,763
Sometimes.

304
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:41,396
- Have you always been like this, Leo?
- Always. I was born this way.

305
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,732
So, you've never seen Giovana's face?

306
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,155
No, never.

307
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:10,675
Man, I don't feel
like doing this assignment.

308
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,427
Tell me about it.

309
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,930
- We should go to the movies.
- The movies?

310
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:20,310
I'm sorry. I promise
I'll get used to this.

311
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,615
What happened?

312
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,659
The giant robot destroyed the church.

313
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,080
And now?

314
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:44,292
Now he is carrying the bride
and the groom, one in each hand.

315
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:49,422
And that?

316
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,633
He's just smashed the groom.

317
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,386
- Did he die?
- I think so.

318
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:02,101
What?

319
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:05,813
The bride has just thrown
the bouquet at the robot's face.

320
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:24,791
- Bye, Gabriel.
- Bye, Leo.

321
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:37,553
So, won't you ever talk to us again?

322
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,185
- Leo?
- Yes?

323
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,438
Leonardo, you know
you should have warned us.

324
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:48,982
Do you know you overreacted?

325
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:52,986
- We were worried, Leo.
- Dad, you're always worried!

326
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,322
If school had a camping trip,
I bet you wouldn't let me go.

327
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:58,992
- What do you mean?
- What camping trip?

328
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,245
There's going to be a camping trip,

329
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:06,416
but I've been avoiding asking you
because I know you'll complain.

330
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,918
We just have to call the school
and get the info.

331
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:11,045
See, everything here is a huge drama!

332
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:14,549
Son, it's a camping trip.
We can't let you go with no information!

333
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,552
It's not just about the camping trip,
OK?

334
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,762
It's about not being able
to be home alone,

335
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:21,681
having to tell you every step I take.

336
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:26,185
- We've agreed you can be home alone!
- OK, but even so.

337
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,980
Do you know how embarrassing it is
to be treated like this?

338
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,900
If you call the school,
everyone will know about it.

339
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,944
What do you suggest?

340
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:38,781
- That you say yes, period!
- Sorry, Leo. It's not that easy.

341
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,618
So embarrassing!
It's as though I'm five years old.

342
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:45,163
Well, Leo. I'm sorry.
I will call the school.

343
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:48,708
If there's no other way.

344
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:57,800
Did you do the assignment yesterday?
Did Gabriel say anything about me?

345
00:27:57,885 --> 00:28:00,928
No. He didn't say anything, Gi.

346
00:28:01,055 --> 00:28:04,015
And we ended up not doing
the assignment. We went to the movies.

347
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:06,851
Come again?

348
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,937
Yeah, Gabriel wanted to go
to the movies, so we went.

349
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:16,069
Get up, Leo. My legs hurt.

350
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:23,701
I can't believe you guys went
to the movies without me!

351
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:28,122
- But we never go!
- Why didn't you invite me?

352
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,500
I'm sorry.
I didn't think about it at the time.

353
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,460
We just decided and went.

354
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,783
What is that, Gabriel?

355
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,994
Belle and Sebastian.
It's a band I like.

356
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,746
- Do you know it?
- No.

357
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:15,837
My brother likes this song.
Back in my town we shared a room,

358
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:17,880
and he always played this album
at night,

359
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:20,049
but he'd always fall asleep
in the middle,

360
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:21,968
so I'd listen to it alone.

361
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:29,767
It's not Tchaikovsky, but it's good.

362
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:38,234
Hi. How are things at the library, Gi?

363
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:42,738
Weren't you going to do
the assignment with Larissa?

364
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:46,826
We are.

365
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,664
OK. You got it. I'll call.

366
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,791
Kisses. Bye!

367
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:58,796
If we get tired,
we can go swimming at Giovana's.

368
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,925
And we can also get a zero
for the assignment!

369
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,105
That's weird!

370
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:19,400
Hello?

371
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:21,569
Hello, Vivaldi?

372
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,112
Silly!

373
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,406
Why did you call me, Gabriel?

374
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:28,826
I wanted to know what my ringtone was.

375
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:31,662
You got it wrong!
It's not Vivaldi, it's Bach!

376
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,249
I don't want to be Bach.

377
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,211
What do you want to be?

378
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:42,215
- Can it be Belle and Sebastian?
- Yes.

379
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,800
Now you can even dance when I call you.

380
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:53,309
Way more upbeat than Bach!

381
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:01,317
- Come dance, Leo.
- No, I don't know how to dance.

382
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:04,529
No? Your fingers seem to know how to.

383
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:07,365
But I don't know how to dance.

384
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:12,286
Some people are good dancers,
others aren't. But everyone can dance.

385
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:17,291
- Maybe another time, OK?
- Boring!

386
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:29,554
Yeah!

387
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,600
You can try to dance.

388
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:41,566
Feel free to move your feet as well.

389
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,990
This probably looks ridiculous,
Gabriel.

390
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:51,617
It doesn't! Trust me.
You could even go to a club now.

391
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:53,119
Shut up, Gabriel!

392
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,457
It's OK for the first lesson.

393
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:07,633
I can't stand doing this assignment
at the library!

394
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:09,552
What's your laziness level right now?

395
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:14,640
Ten! Although I'm past feeling lazy,
I'm feeling homicidal!

396
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:18,019
Relax, Gi. We'll do
the next one together, OK?

397
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,021
Shall we go?

398
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,815
No! Please, don't go.
Stay a little bit more!

399
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,692
Gi, I'm sorry.

400
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:30,698
No.

401
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,495
Bye, Gi.

402
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,915
Goodbye, boys!

403
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:49,550
- It's impossible, seriously.
- Gabriel, it's easy.

404
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:56,557
The locomotive released one. . .

405
00:32:56,642 --> 00:33:00,102
How do I know
what you're saying is correct?

406
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:02,313
You're going to have to trust me.

407
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:04,065
Give me your hand.

408
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,235
Released one stron. . .

409
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,654
This is a hyphen. . .

410
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:12,031
It's impossible.
Seriously, I give up!

411
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:16,160
- Gabriel, it's not impossible.
- I'll take a long time to learn this.

412
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,205
What's impossible is me riding a bike,
Gabriel. Not this!

413
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,124
- Hi, Gabriel.
- Hi.

414
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:25,086
- Do you guys want juice or something?
- No, thank you.

415
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,879
Thanks. We'll get something later.

416
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:30,049
OK. If you need anything,
I'm in the living room.

417
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,596
Besides, you can read Braille
with your eyes.

418
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:38,265
It's the same alphabet, but in Braille.

419
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:45,356
- Here.
- What is that?

420
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,400
- The alphabet in Braille.
- Cool!

421
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:54,990
Leo, there's going to be an eclipse
today. Should we watch it?

422
00:33:56,034 --> 00:34:01,580
Of course we'll watch the eclipse!
I'm sorry!

423
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:05,584
My dad said there's a square nearby
that's perfect for watching the eclipse.

424
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:06,836
I really want to go.

425
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:11,215
- Let's do it! What time?
- Late, around 1 am.

426
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:16,095
Never mind, then,
my mum would never let me go.

427
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,641
We could sneak out.

428
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,731
- Let's go, Leo.
- Let's.

429
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:30,651
Hold on to my shoulder.

430
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:32,486
Go ahead.

431
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,038
What's so interesting about an eclipse?

432
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:47,042
It's seeing the moon
vanishing from the sky.

433
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:48,502
Vanishing how?

434
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:54,759
It disappears from the sky.

435
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:58,179
I mean, it stops being illuminated.

436
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,765
Meaning?

437
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,102
Let me think.

438
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:08,355
You know when you're sunbathing

439
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,109
and you feel the warmth
on one side of your face?

440
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:15,946
So, that same side is also
being illuminated by the sun.

441
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:18,616
But what does that have to do
with an eclipse?

442
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:26,248
Wait up.

443
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,514
Give me your hand.

444
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:48,270
Here's the sun, the Earth
and the moon.

445
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:52,608
The sun illuminates the Earth,
the moon,

446
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,693
as well as your face.

447
00:35:56,655 --> 00:36:01,700
An eclipse happens when the three
of them are perfectly aligned,

448
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:05,788
and that light stops
illuminating the moon.

449
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:10,584
Since we only see what is illuminated,
we can no longer see the moon.

450
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:14,880
But it's quick, because the Earth
moves out of the way

451
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:17,049
and we can see the moon again.

452
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,343
- Got it?
- I think so.

453
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:24,515
It's weird to try to explain this.
It seems so simple.

454
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:26,327
See ya.

455
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:31,707
Leo, I left my hoodie in your room.

456
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:34,126
Can you bring it to school
tomorrow, please?

457
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,462
- Yes, I will.
- Thanks.

458
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,593
- Bye.
- Bye.

459
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:12,534
Grandma, how long
have you and Grandpa been together?

460
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,787
It's been a while.

461
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,872
'71 , '81 . . .

462
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,584
Oh my. . . 42 years!

463
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:24,630
Wow, so long!
Do you still love each other?

464
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:28,550
Some days more than others.

465
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,638
How did you meet?

466
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:35,349
It was before we moved to São Paulo.

467
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,852
He was a bus driver on the line
I used to take to go to work.

468
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:42,523
The truth is, I could take a later bus,

469
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:47,111
but I always ended up arriving early
at work just so I could ride with him.

470
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,948
One day I was running late
and was so distraught.

471
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:54,118
I ran to see if I could catch him,

472
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:58,038
and to my surprise, he was still there.

473
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:00,332
He refused to leave
before I got there.

474
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,377
Everyone was yelling at him,
it was a mess.

475
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,839
When I got there,
people weren't very happy with me.

476
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:13,262
Isn't it early for your mum
to be picking you up?

477
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:14,513
No. It's Gabriel.

478
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:17,975
We're doing an assignment
and he's come to pick me up.

479
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,399
- I can't believe it!
- It's true!

480
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:30,737
Hello?

481
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,324
This is Leo.

482
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:38,120
Really?

483
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:43,834
Sandra. I don't know if I can stop by

484
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:47,880
because my parents are travelling
and won't be back until next week.

485
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:51,091
Would it be OK if I call you
when they get back?

486
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:55,012
OK, thanks.

487
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:58,140
Your parents are away?

488
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:01,185
No. It was the lady from
the exchange programme agency.

489
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:03,228
She said she found an American agency

490
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:05,856
that specialises
in the visually impaired.

491
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:09,443
- And why did you lie?
- I don't know.

492
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:15,073
- Your mum will never let you go away.
- Gee! Thanks for the support!

493
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:17,242
- Hey!
- Hi!

494
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,912
Have you guys seen Gabriel around?

495
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:22,581
- He went to the restroom. Why?
- Nothing much.

496
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,750
I wanted to talk to him about something.

497
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:29,129
Gabriel is the cutest,
isn't he, Giovana?

498
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:31,465
And his adorable curls!

499
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:37,846
He's not from São Paulo.
Where is he from again?

500
00:42:37,931 --> 00:42:40,224
- I think he's from Ita. . .
- He's over there. Kiss.

501
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:45,229
She's such a slut, isn't she?

502
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,524
There, she's made her move!

503
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:53,362
She's all friendly!
Talking to him, playing with her hair.

504
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:56,490
She touched his shoulder, Leo.

505
00:42:57,492 --> 00:43:01,828
And his hand!
She doesn't even know if he's washed it!

506
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,539
She doesn't even try to be discreet!

507
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,675
Leo, I don't think you need
your walking stick any more.

508
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,178
OK.

509
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:23,600
Did you hear Karina's question
during chemistry class?

510
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:25,143
She's so dumb!

511
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:26,436
Poor thing!

512
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:32,484
Poor thing, but she's also annoying,
right? Or do you think she's cool?

513
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:36,571
I think she's nice.
She even invited me to her party.

514
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:39,533
- What party?
- A party she's throwing.

515
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,077
A huge party. She's moving
and the house is empty.

516
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,787
She's inviting the whole class.

517
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:47,249
- Doesn't sound fun.
- Mind the step.

518
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:51,628
- I'm going to be the DJ.
- Why?

519
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:57,050
- I like Karina. Why don't you like her?
- It's not that I don't like her.

520
00:43:57,176 --> 00:44:02,347
But the last place I want to go to
is a party with our classmates!

521
00:44:02,432 --> 00:44:06,518
But it might be fun.
People act differently outside school.

522
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:09,938
- I doubt it.
- Aren't you different?

523
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,153
Should I leave the door open, Leo?

524
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:17,988
No. You can close it.

525
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,040
Hi, Gi.

526
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,250
Yes.

527
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:34,004
Giovana wants to talk to you.

528
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:36,840
Hi, Gi.

529
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:42,554
Sorry! My cellphone
must be in my backpack.

530
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:45,932
I'm home. We're doing the assignment.

531
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:50,896
Weren't you doing the assignment
in the library?

532
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,194
I'm sorry, Gi.

533
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,865
Giovana?

534
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,161
What happened?

535
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:08,830
Giovana got pissed
because we didn't wait for her.

536
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:12,125
Wasn't she staying in the library
with Larissa?

537
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,710
Apparently not.

538
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,274
Let's go, Leo.

539
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,193
Without Giovana?

540
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:41,113
No way, Gabriel. She'll kill us.

541
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:44,324
She just walked by
without saying goodbye.

542
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:46,785
- For real?
- For real.

543
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,081
Let's go, then.

544
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:07,264
What's up, Leonardo?

545
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:10,559
New boyfriend?

546
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:11,726
Ignore it, Leo.

547
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:16,857
The new guy is doing you good.
You're becoming more manly.

548
00:46:27,452 --> 00:46:29,703
- It's hot.
- Thanks.

549
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:36,209
I was thinking about going on an
exchange programme. What do you think?

550
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:39,171
- You want to do what, Leo?
- Exchange programme.

551
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:43,216
Some kids at school
talked about it and I got interested.

552
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:46,553
- Do you mean live in another country?
- Yeah!

553
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:50,098
- You've got to be kidding!
- Oh, no. Here we go!

554
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,559
Go where? This discussion
isn't going anywhere!

555
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,437
- Explain this to us. . .
- Explain what?

556
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:59,941
Are you insane? Leonardo isn't going
to live abroad by himself. Period!

557
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:01,318
- Why not?
- Why not, Leo?

558
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:03,445
Other people do it.
What's the problem?

559
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:07,908
Well, even if we said yes, tell me,
who's going to take in a blind kid?

560
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:10,243
Leo!

561
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:13,121
Carlos!

562
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:14,873
Carlos?

563
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:26,343
- Where did you get this?
- At an exchange programme agency.

564
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:28,512
There's one in Los Angeles
for blind people.

565
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:32,057
Do you want to call them
to see who'll take care of me?

566
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:36,102
- Is your English any good?
- You're not going. Period!

567
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:12,138
Leonardo, Leonardo. . .

568
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:27,237
It must be because I swim. I used
to swim a lot back in my hometown.

569
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,197
Gabriel?

570
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:35,453
I used to lift weights sometimes.
That must be it.

571
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:39,165
What are you doing here?

572
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:45,589
Yeah, it really shows.

573
00:48:46,299 --> 00:48:47,382
Karina?

574
00:48:50,011 --> 00:48:52,637
We should go swimming together.

575
00:48:53,723 --> 00:48:56,182
I don't have my swimming trunks.

576
00:48:58,603 --> 00:48:59,853
Gabriel?

577
00:49:03,316 --> 00:49:05,984
Who said we need them?

578
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:09,821
You got it, babe!

579
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,406
Gabriel, answer me.

580
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:19,623
You've got my number, right?

581
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:46,149
Dad!

582
00:49:48,069 --> 00:49:51,154
What's up, son? Are you OK?

583
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:53,823
Can you help me shave?

584
00:49:58,621 --> 00:50:00,038
Take this.

585
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:07,003
Give me this.

586
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:09,130
Take the foam.

587
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:15,345
Gee, son. That's too much.

588
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:18,098
I'll throw some away.

589
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:20,058
OK. Put it on your face.

590
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:24,938
It's me.

591
00:50:32,405 --> 00:50:34,531
- Careful with your mouth, OK?
- OK.

592
00:50:37,493 --> 00:50:38,702
Let me see.

593
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:41,496
Wash your hands.

594
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:49,587
Put the razor in the hot water,
it's easier.

595
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:54,008
Here.

596
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:11,192
I was thinking about
the exchange programme you mentioned.

597
00:51:11,277 --> 00:51:12,694
- Really?
- Really.

598
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:15,613
- But don't talk while you're shaving.
- Sorry.

599
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:22,787
I'm trying to understand
your desire to go so far away.

600
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:28,793
I think it's natural,
especially at your age, . . .

601
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,673
. .to want to see other places,

602
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:37,677
meet new people, make other friends.

603
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:39,596
I think it's normal.

604
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:45,810
But I also think it's natural
to fight with your parents.

605
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:49,314
I was like that, too.

606
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:54,944
But leaving the country to run away
from fights is a bit extreme.

607
00:51:58,282 --> 00:51:59,657
You know. . .

608
00:52:01,494 --> 00:52:06,748
I'm thinking about talking
to your mother about the programme.

609
00:52:10,211 --> 00:52:15,465
But first I need to make sure that
you want to go for the right reasons.

610
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:18,218
Do you agree, Leo?

611
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:24,682
- Do you agree?
- Can I talk now?

612
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:27,644
I agree, Dad.

613
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:33,608
- How is it?
- Let me see.

614
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:46,955
Hi!

615
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:49,833
- Are you having fun?
- Yeah!

616
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,835
- What's his name?
- Cupcake!

617
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:55,296
- Cupcake, have a drink, man.
- No, he's a baby!

618
00:52:58,968 --> 00:53:00,635
Hey, girl!

619
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:03,179
Have you met Cupcake?
Cupcake, this is Giovana.

620
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:06,975
Hi, Cupcake!

621
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:09,853
Get up and dance. Don't just sit there.

622
00:53:13,274 --> 00:53:14,983
- What's up?
- What's up?

623
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:18,319
- Are you looking for someone?
- D'you know who's here?

624
00:53:18,404 --> 00:53:20,238
It's true. Go for it.

625
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:22,740
- Hi, DJ.
- Hey.

626
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:26,786
Cupcake wants to ask for a song.
Can you put him in his bed, please?

627
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:30,039
- Are you sleepy, Cupcake?
- He's a baby. He goes to bed early.

628
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,884
Hi, Leo. Go dance. You look
like Giovana, just sitting there.

629
00:53:41,886 --> 00:53:43,970
I'll go dance in a little bit, Karina.

630
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:15,418
Hi. What are you guys hiding over here?

631
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,711
It's nothing.

632
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:17,921
Carlinhos!

633
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:21,925
Vodka and whiskey.
Do you want some?

634
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:25,678
Straight?

635
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,316
Be careful!

636
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:40,902
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

637
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,127
Leo, come dance.

638
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:05,343
I made a playlist.
It's going to play for a while, OK?

639
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:06,803
Of course. Enjoy yourself!

640
00:55:08,389 --> 00:55:12,850
- Leo, you on the dance floor? Finally!
- Who'd have guessed?

641
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:19,565
Feel free to move your feet.

642
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,326
I'll go get a drink.
You guys want anything?

643
00:55:30,411 --> 00:55:31,619
I'll come with you.

644
00:55:31,704 --> 00:55:34,664
No way! Now that you're dancing,
you can stay and dance with me.

645
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,040
I'll be right back.

646
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:42,839
Leo, I actually wanted to talk to you
about something.

647
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:46,050
- Now?
- It's better now that we're alone!

648
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:49,095
OK.

649
00:55:50,014 --> 00:55:52,849
Has Gabriel ever talked to you about me?

650
00:55:52,975 --> 00:55:56,185
- What do you mean?
- About whether he's into me.

651
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:59,230
No.

652
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:13,202
- What's up, Gigi?
- What?

653
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:16,789
Want to pick up where we left off
at the last killer party?

654
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:21,461
Fabio, if we do, this time,
the party won't be the only killer.

655
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:23,796
- Is that how it's going to be?
- Yes.

656
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,257
Fine!

657
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,428
What's up, Rodrigo?

658
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:38,853
- What's up, Gi? What are you drinking?
- I don't know.

659
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,980
How can you not know?

660
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:44,484
- Vodka, whiskey. . .
- Can I taste it?

661
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,407
Vodka.

662
00:56:51,492 --> 00:56:54,202
Could you help me?
Maybe give him some hints?

663
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:55,369
Sure.

664
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:58,581
Thanks, Leo! You are a sweetheart.

665
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:01,417
Well, I'm going to check
how the party's going, OK?

666
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:13,888
It's time to play spin the bottle!

667
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,891
Make a circle, everyone.

668
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:20,144
- Come with us, Leo.
- No, thanks.

669
00:57:20,229 --> 00:57:24,107
- Stay, Leo! It's going to be fun.
- No, I'm not in the mood.

670
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:27,693
C'mon, Leo!
Don't you ever want to be kissed?

671
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:29,946
Douche! I don't have a problem
with the game!

672
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:33,825
- So, prove it and stay!
- Fine, I'll stay!

673
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:35,326
Let's go sit over there.

674
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:36,869
Dimitri, move over.

675
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:40,164
Turn, turn. You can sit.

676
00:57:40,249 --> 00:57:42,959
OK, let's start with me.

677
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:48,881
I'll spin the bottle and whoever
it points to has to kiss me. OK?

678
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:51,259
Sweet.

679
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:57,890
Shouldn't you be taking care
of your dear friend?

680
00:57:57,975 --> 00:57:59,559
He's fine.

681
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:03,813
In fact, you should go talk to him.

682
00:58:04,148 --> 00:58:06,607
About what?
He doesn't like me any more!

683
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:08,317
That's ridiculous, Giovana!

684
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:13,489
It's true. Besides,
he doesn't want to talk to me.

685
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:17,660
Aren't you the one
that didn't answer his call?

686
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:20,538
He thinks you don't want to talk to him.

687
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:26,377
- This is all your fault.
- My fault? Why?

688
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:28,963
Things were great before you got here.

689
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:31,215
Now, I'm not even talking
to my best friend.

690
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:40,391
Your turn, Matheus.

691
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:41,517
Go, Matheus!

692
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:55,448
You also went to the movies
and didn't invite me.

693
00:58:57,576 --> 00:59:01,787
Gi, it wasn't on purpose!
Leo didn't mean to.

694
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:03,915
Of course he did!

695
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:07,877
Now he doesn't even want me
to take him home. Didn't you notice?

696
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:10,671
It's all you, you, you. . .

697
00:59:14,218 --> 00:59:17,762
See? You don't have an answer.

698
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:33,486
- I'm sorry.
- Bitch.

699
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:41,744
Ladies and gentlemen,

700
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:45,498
the moment you've all been
waiting for has arrived.

701
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:49,877
I believe many of you
are here just because of her.

702
00:59:50,963 --> 00:59:53,464
- Am I right or not, Marta?
- Me?

703
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,383
No, some other Marta!

704
00:59:56,176 --> 00:59:58,010
You're such a douche!

705
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:04,642
Leonardo!

706
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:08,271
You hit the jackpot!
For real, man.

707
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:10,731
C'mon, stand up, Marta!

708
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:13,985
- C'mon, Gui, get him up.
- Get up, get up.

709
01:00:17,656 --> 01:00:20,074
I'm sorry for getting between
you and Leo.

710
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:26,080
- It's too late, don't you think?
- I'm still sorry.

711
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:31,043
I just wanted to understand him.

712
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:34,130
This whole exchange programme thing,
for example.

713
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:37,300
He didn't care that he would
leave me here by myself.

714
01:00:39,011 --> 01:00:43,556
How can your best friend leave
without even thinking about you?

715
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,392
What exchange programme thing?

716
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:51,564
Leonardo wants to go on an exchange
programme. Didn't he tell you?

717
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:53,566
No.

718
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,318
Wait up, everyone!

719
01:00:55,402 --> 01:00:59,822
Since this is a special moment
in Leo's life,

720
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:02,658
it's only fair
that we put some music on.

721
01:01:02,743 --> 01:01:05,411
- What do you think?
- Of course.

722
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:06,662
So. . .

723
01:01:23,263 --> 01:01:27,266
What really matters
is that he doesn't care about me.

724
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:31,270
He chose you over me in ten seconds!
And he doesn't even realise it.

725
01:01:31,355 --> 01:01:34,315
- It's not like that, Gi.
- Yes, it is!

726
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:38,361
You have no idea what we were like
before you got here.

727
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:42,448
Why don't you tell him that?

728
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:50,081
You need to share how you feel.
There's no point bottling it up.

729
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:54,460
Right?

730
01:02:07,516 --> 01:02:09,141
Get ready.

731
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:12,144
Are you people insane?

732
01:02:12,229 --> 01:02:14,730
- C'mon, Leo.
- Giovana, what are you doing?

733
01:02:16,024 --> 01:02:18,317
Cupcake is such a cutie!

734
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:22,780
- Giovana, are you crazy?
- C'mon, Leo, let's get out of here!

735
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:25,825
I can't believe
you're jealous of Marta, too!

736
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:28,369
Weren't you the one saying
I should kiss someone?

737
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:35,751
I was so sad that we've kind of
been apart, but you've changed.

738
01:02:35,836 --> 01:02:38,462
I don't even know
if I can trust you any more!

739
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,381
Fuck you, Leonardo!

740
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:47,513
- Where's Giovana?
- She left.

741
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:51,225
- I think we should go too, Leo.
- Why? The party is great!

742
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:54,478
Or are you going to be like Giovana?
Why don't you go after Karina?

743
01:02:54,563 --> 01:02:56,605
Seriously, Leo. Let's go, it's late.

744
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:58,107
Gabriel! I don't get it!

745
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:01,110
First, you drag me to the party
and now you drag me out of it.

746
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:02,445
What's going on?

747
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:07,116
- Answer me, Gabriel!
- Why are you so angry at me?

748
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,619
Because everyone wants to control me
and won't let me kiss anyone!

749
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,923
No new calls.

750
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:18,229
Leo, I'm going to the supermarket.
Do you want anything?

751
01:04:19,147 --> 01:04:21,649
- I'll go with you, Mum.
- Oh, my!

752
01:04:22,442 --> 01:04:24,985
Get out of this room for a while.

753
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:25,129
743.

754
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:30,092
C'mon, guys, come inside!
C'mon, we're late!

755
01:05:30,218 --> 01:05:34,096
Hurry. C'mon, class. Get on the bus.

756
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:36,890
We're late.

757
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:54,033
743.

758
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:20,476
What's up, Leo?
You're the only one missing!

759
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:23,020
- Want me to help you?
- Thanks, teacher.

760
01:06:32,072 --> 01:06:34,114
Do you always have to be last?

761
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:37,743
Guys, get on the bus!
Take pictures there. . . Let's go!

762
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:45,959
Four, six, eight, ten, 1 2. . .

763
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:56,970
Class, class! Silence please!

764
01:06:57,055 --> 01:07:00,391
I'm going to have to check you by name
because we're missing two people.

765
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:05,062
Well, well!
They're not missing any more!

766
01:07:08,316 --> 01:07:13,070
Guys, you've got dirty minds! Come on,
Gabriel. There's a seat at the back.

767
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:22,413
Guys, attention! Let's go over
the rules and instructions for the trip.

768
01:07:22,497 --> 01:07:24,289
People who brought tents. . .

769
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:38,929
Leo! I collected the sample for you.
Keep this vial with you.

770
01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:42,808
- Thanks.
- We'll analyse it in the lab later.

771
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:43,934
Teacher!

772
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:46,562
There's a form that must be filled in.

773
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:48,731
Ask a classmate
to help you with that later.

774
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:49,940
OK.

775
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:53,235
If you need anything, I'll be around.
Just call me.

776
01:07:55,363 --> 01:07:56,405
Hey.

777
01:07:57,615 --> 01:08:00,075
Do we have to fill in this form again?

778
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:03,036
No, it's on the other side
of the pond. . .

779
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:21,346
- Good morning, Leonardo.
- Good morning.

780
01:08:22,307 --> 01:08:24,683
So, how is the assignment going?

781
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:30,022
- It's good.
- Let me see.

782
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:37,279
Dude, I think your zooplankton
is kind of down.

783
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:40,157
What about yours, how is it?

784
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:43,410
Mine is hungover, for sure!

785
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:54,421
Karina's party was crazy, right?

786
01:08:56,007 --> 01:09:00,093
- I can't remember anything.
- How so?

787
01:09:01,012 --> 01:09:02,554
I was totally drunk.

788
01:09:06,935 --> 01:09:10,437
The only thing I remember is being
in the bathroom arguing with Giovana.

789
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:14,441
- Did you drink that much?
- I guess.

790
01:09:27,789 --> 01:09:32,376
- Gabriel, where are your curls?
- Wait till it's dry.

791
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:35,629
There you go!

792
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,761
- Wanna go and sit down, Leo?
- Yeah.

793
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:07,703
- Don't you wear sunscreen?
- No, I hate it.

794
01:10:07,787 --> 01:10:09,746
Really? Not even on your face?

795
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:12,374
Alright. . .

796
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:27,890
There's some here.

797
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:34,104
What about on your body?

798
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:38,317
You sound like my mum, Gabriel!

799
01:10:48,828 --> 01:10:51,872
Wow! The relationship is getting hot!

800
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:55,834
- Mind your own business, jackass!
- He's so hysterical!

801
01:11:10,058 --> 01:11:12,476
So, Leo, can we go now?

802
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,187
- I think we've waited long enough.
- We haven't.

803
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:18,106
I'm not going to shower
with a bunch of other people.

804
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:19,483
Don't be so fussy!

805
01:11:19,567 --> 01:11:23,028
I'm not being fussy! It's embarrassing.

806
01:11:23,863 --> 01:11:26,406
Well, Leo. Get over it,
because I'm going.

807
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:28,116
OK, Gabriel. Wait!

808
01:11:31,746 --> 01:11:33,038
Silly!

809
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:39,503
There's no one else here.
Someone left the shower on.

810
01:11:43,383 --> 01:11:46,051
Get undressed
and I'll help you get in the shower.

811
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:47,177
I'm ready.

812
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:49,805
Are you going to shower
with your shorts on?

813
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:53,141
- Yes.
- Leonardo, you're a funny guy.

814
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:57,646
C'mon let's go.

815
01:12:01,776 --> 01:12:03,610
Put your stuff here.

816
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:41,356
- The sunscreen won't wash out.
- Use more soap.

817
01:13:14,974 --> 01:13:17,225
I was thinking about
having a drink tonight.

818
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:20,437
Look at that!

819
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:22,189
There's always a first time.

820
01:13:22,273 --> 01:13:25,108
We could have a drink together.
Are you going to have a drink?

821
01:13:25,193 --> 01:13:27,736
I guess so.

822
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:39,081
So, Leo. I'm done here, OK?

823
01:13:39,499 --> 01:13:41,458
- Already?
- Yeah.

824
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:10,612
- Is your zooplankton still hungover?
- Yes.

825
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:14,032
- Hi, Gabs! Hi, Leo!
- Hi!

826
01:14:14,117 --> 01:14:18,036
- I love that shirt, Gabriel.
- Thanks.

827
01:14:18,121 --> 01:14:21,206
- So, are you guys pumped up?
- I'm kind of sleepy.

828
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:24,793
But the party hasn't even started.
We're going to watch the sunrise!

829
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:27,337
Speak for yourself!
I'm not going to watch anything!

830
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:29,422
I'm sorry.

831
01:14:29,507 --> 01:14:31,925
Weren't you going
to have a drink tonight, Leo?

832
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:35,053
That was earlier! I'm tired now.

833
01:14:35,138 --> 01:14:37,681
No. Seriously,
tonight we're going to have a drink.

834
01:14:42,603 --> 01:14:44,479
Is Giovana around?

835
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:50,277
She's up ahead,
pretending she can't see us.

836
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:52,154
Are you not talking to Giovana, Leo?

837
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:56,658
- I don't know. . .
- You should talk to her.

838
01:14:56,742 --> 01:15:00,745
About what? If she's pretending not to
see us, what am I going to say to her?

839
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:03,165
- Did you call me?
- Sit with us!

840
01:15:03,249 --> 01:15:05,542
- What for?
- C'mon, sit with us.

841
01:15:11,299 --> 01:15:13,842
Karina and I will get
something to drink, right?

842
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:16,845
- Will we?
- Yes! We'll be right back.

843
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:33,236
I'm sorry.

844
01:15:33,321 --> 01:15:37,574
For what? For being a coward
and asking Gabriel to call me here?

845
01:15:37,658 --> 01:15:40,619
- No, Gi!
- Then what?

846
01:15:41,829 --> 01:15:43,580
I don't know. . . so many things.

847
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:46,249
Then start from the beginning.

848
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:53,506
Sorry I spoke to you that way
at Karina's party.

849
01:15:53,591 --> 01:15:56,092
Leo, they were going
to make you kiss a dog!

850
01:15:56,594 --> 01:15:58,762
- What?
- What, what?

851
01:15:58,846 --> 01:16:00,180
What dog, Gi?

852
01:16:01,224 --> 01:16:03,808
- Oh, Leo!
- Giovana, what dog?

853
01:16:07,188 --> 01:16:11,233
When I dragged you out of the party,
Fabio was holding a dog in front of you.

854
01:16:19,242 --> 01:16:20,992
Thanks for getting me out of there.

855
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:25,163
Forgive me, too.
I overreacted when we had that fight.

856
01:16:25,248 --> 01:16:29,376
- But you chose Gabriel over me so fast.
- I'm never going to leave you!

857
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:34,422
Imagine an eclipse.
The Earth is in front of the sun,

858
01:16:34,507 --> 01:16:37,384
and the moon disappears from the sky,
but it's still there.

859
01:16:37,468 --> 01:16:42,639
At some point, the Earth moves and
we can see the moon again. Just like us!

860
01:16:42,723 --> 01:16:45,392
I don't follow.
What does that have to do with us?

861
01:16:45,476 --> 01:16:48,645
In our eclipse, Gabriel would be
the Earth and you, the moon, get it?

862
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:52,107
- And you are the sun, hot stuff?
- Yes.

863
01:16:52,984 --> 01:16:58,071
It depends. If it were a solar eclipse,
then you would be the sun, hot stuff!

864
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:15,463
- Where do you think Earth is?
- With the meteor named Karina.

865
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,009
Let's go have a drink with them.

866
01:17:21,053 --> 01:17:22,387
Let's go.

867
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:43,867
- So, can you see them?
- No.

868
01:17:44,452 --> 01:17:46,786
Are you sure
you can't see them anywhere?

869
01:17:46,871 --> 01:17:48,330
No, Leo.

870
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:53,043
- They're probably making out.
- You think?

871
01:17:53,127 --> 01:17:55,337
They've been really close lately.

872
01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:59,341
You know what?
Let's have a drink without them.

873
01:17:59,467 --> 01:18:01,092
Where can we get some vodka?

874
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:06,181
What's up, Carlinhos?
Do you have vodka?

875
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:09,351
Giovana? Karina's party
was good for you, huh?

876
01:18:09,477 --> 01:18:12,645
- Yeah, maybe I'm an alcoholic.
- Come on in.

877
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:14,647
Wait, Leo's here.

878
01:18:15,608 --> 01:18:19,944
Come. Go down.
Sit in that corner.

879
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:22,739
- Excuse me.
- OK.

880
01:18:24,325 --> 01:18:26,451
Welcome to my headquarters.

881
01:18:30,998 --> 01:18:33,208
- Are you going to have a drink, too?
- Yes.

882
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:35,293
Cool.

883
01:18:39,090 --> 01:18:43,134
Thanks. Carlinhos,
have you seen Gabriel?

884
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:46,971
I saw him with Karina.
But that was a while ago.

885
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:49,057
Those two are always together, right?

886
01:18:50,935 --> 01:18:52,560
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

887
01:19:08,953 --> 01:19:13,081
- Gi, am I handsome?
- What do you mean?

888
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:17,419
Do you think people
consider me attractive?

889
01:19:17,545 --> 01:19:19,254
I find you attractive.

890
01:19:19,338 --> 01:19:25,510
You don't count, Gi! Do you think
other people find me attractive?

891
01:19:26,137 --> 01:19:29,764
I don't know, Leo.
I never notice other people's reactions.

892
01:19:29,849 --> 01:19:31,683
You should ask Karina!

893
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:35,478
No. She thinks Gabriel is handsome.

894
01:19:38,482 --> 01:19:41,192
Would you miss me
if I did the exchange programme?

895
01:19:42,695 --> 01:19:43,820
A lot.

896
01:19:44,905 --> 01:19:46,030
Me too.

897
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:48,908
Do you think
we'd still be friends if you went?

898
01:19:48,993 --> 01:19:50,034
Of course.

899
01:19:55,958 --> 01:20:00,211
- I need to tell you something.
- Wow! You look so serious!

900
01:20:02,006 --> 01:20:05,717
- It's not that simple.
- Just spit it out, Leo!

901
01:20:05,843 --> 01:20:06,968
Is there anyone around?

902
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:11,097
No, everyone's far away.

903
01:20:15,436 --> 01:20:17,187
I think I'm in love with Gabriel.

904
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:24,194
Gi?

905
01:20:24,278 --> 01:20:25,737
Hey!

906
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:30,533
- What do you mean, in love?
- Like a boyfriend in love.

907
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:36,956
Aren't you going to say something?

908
01:20:37,041 --> 01:20:39,834
My cup is empty, Leo.
I'll get another drink.

909
01:20:39,919 --> 01:20:41,211
Giovana?

910
01:21:34,265 --> 01:21:37,350
Leo, get in the water!

911
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:39,602
C'mon, Leo! It's so good!

912
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:45,108
Thanks, guys. But I'm looking
for Giovana. Have you seen her?

913
01:21:45,234 --> 01:21:47,151
She's probably asleep by now.

914
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:49,404
Leo, get in the water!
Seriously, it's great!

915
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:51,155
And we'll watch the sunrise!

916
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:54,701
- Karina!
- Sorry. I always forget.

917
01:21:55,202 --> 01:21:57,245
I can't, I don't have
my swimming trunks on.

918
01:21:57,329 --> 01:22:01,583
We don't either.
Who said we need them?

919
01:22:01,709 --> 01:22:03,167
Come in, already!

920
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:39,162
Jeez, Leo. You're so warm.

921
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,539
Here's the thermometer, son.

922
01:22:45,336 --> 01:22:47,629
I can't believe you got sick.

923
01:22:47,755 --> 01:22:49,922
Aren't you the responsible adult?

924
01:22:50,007 --> 01:22:53,134
- It's just a cold, Mum!
- Just a cold?

925
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:56,262
Your teacher told me
you were swimming at night, Leo!

926
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:01,726
Drink your tea.

927
01:23:05,481 --> 01:23:09,734
And we're supposed to let you go abroad
after you pull something like this?

928
01:23:10,611 --> 01:23:14,656
- Like you've never done anything wrong.
- But that's different.

929
01:23:15,658 --> 01:23:17,992
- Why?
- Because you're my son, Leo!

930
01:23:18,077 --> 01:23:20,244
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

931
01:23:20,371 --> 01:23:23,206
- It doesn't matter the way you are.
- Yeah, right.

932
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:26,626
One day you'll have a son
and you'll understand.

933
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:30,546
- Not me! I don't want kids.
- No? Why?

934
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:35,176
- There are enough people in the world.
- You can adopt one.

935
01:23:36,303 --> 01:23:39,555
One day you will meet someone
and start dating. Then, who knows?

936
01:23:39,682 --> 01:23:41,933
- I doubt it!
- Doubt what?

937
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:45,269
That you'll start dating
or that you'll want kids?

938
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:46,396
Both.

939
01:23:48,482 --> 01:23:51,943
You're still very young.
There's no point in forcing things.

940
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:55,613
So much is going to happen in your life.
So much will change.

941
01:23:57,074 --> 01:23:59,617
You're still going to get
a lot of flu and colds!

942
01:23:59,702 --> 01:24:03,538
And you should know that I'll keep
trying to prevent you from getting sick.

943
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:16,342
- I'll call you for lunch in a while.
- Alright.

944
01:24:37,114 --> 01:24:39,782
- Hi.
- Hi, Gi.

945
01:24:41,118 --> 01:24:44,036
- How are you?
- Fine, and you?

946
01:24:45,122 --> 01:24:46,372
Sort of. . .

947
01:24:48,751 --> 01:24:50,209
Got it.

948
01:24:54,173 --> 01:24:55,590
I heard you got sick.

949
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:57,925
Yes, I did.

950
01:25:00,554 --> 01:25:04,015
Do you think
you'll go to school tomorrow?

951
01:25:04,141 --> 01:25:05,349
I don't know.

952
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:10,271
So, you like Gabriel, right?

953
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:13,566
Silly!

954
01:25:20,824 --> 01:25:22,742
Do you forgive me for ignoring the news?

955
01:25:23,577 --> 01:25:26,120
I guess I never thought of you that way.

956
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:30,041
But then again,
I never thought we would ever fight.

957
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:32,543
Weren't you the one
who wanted a great drama?

958
01:25:32,628 --> 01:25:35,421
No, I wanted a great romance!
Just like you do!

959
01:25:35,506 --> 01:25:38,090
In my case, it is also a great drama.

960
01:25:38,175 --> 01:25:40,927
Because my great romance
is probably kissing Karina!

961
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:45,807
- You think?
- It's obvious. You said it yourself.

962
01:25:47,810 --> 01:25:52,814
We never know with these things, right?
Look at you, for instance.

963
01:25:56,819 --> 01:25:59,237
I think you guys
would make a cute couple.

964
01:26:10,499 --> 01:26:15,461
- Have you talked to Leo recently?
- He texted me saying he was sick.

965
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:20,383
You should stop by his house.

966
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:23,761
Today's Wednesday. He's there alone.

967
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:32,812
- Who is it?
- It's Gabriel.

968
01:26:40,571 --> 01:26:43,990
- I'm the only one who got sick, right?
- Poor thing.

969
01:26:45,576 --> 01:26:50,246
But Karina said the pool
was bad for her hair. Too much chlorine.

970
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:01,549
- Did you make out with Karina?
- No. Why?

971
01:27:02,885 --> 01:27:04,677
You two disappeared at the camp,

972
01:27:04,761 --> 01:27:07,221
and everyone was saying
you were together.

973
01:27:12,311 --> 01:27:16,063
So, remember when you
were talking to Giovana?

974
01:27:17,274 --> 01:27:19,400
I thought you guys should be alone.

975
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:22,695
So I killed some time with Karina,
looking for something to drink.

976
01:27:23,488 --> 01:27:25,781
When we got there, she tried to kiss me.

977
01:27:26,408 --> 01:27:29,827
- But I turned my face away.
- Jeez! What about her?

978
01:27:29,912 --> 01:27:31,829
She asked me
why I didn't want to kiss her.

979
01:27:31,914 --> 01:27:33,039
What did you tell her?

980
01:27:33,123 --> 01:27:35,875
That I had a girlfriend back in Itapira.

981
01:27:35,959 --> 01:27:38,544
After I told her
about my fake girlfriend,

982
01:27:38,629 --> 01:27:42,340
she decided to tell me stories
about her ex-boyfriends.

983
01:27:42,424 --> 01:27:45,301
And I was making up stories
about my fake girlfriend.

984
01:27:45,385 --> 01:27:49,555
The more we talked, the more we drank.
And we ended up in the pool.

985
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:51,307
That's when you found us.

986
01:27:53,393 --> 01:27:55,853
You must have drunk a hell of a lot
at Karina's party.

987
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:57,939
What do you mean?

988
01:27:58,065 --> 01:28:02,610
If you drank the whole night at the camp
and still remember everything,

989
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:05,446
imagine how much you drank
at Karina's party

990
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:07,448
for you to black out like that!

991
01:28:10,077 --> 01:28:12,620
But why didn't you kiss her?

992
01:28:14,331 --> 01:28:15,998
Well. . .

993
01:28:17,042 --> 01:28:20,378
I actually like someone else.

994
01:28:22,506 --> 01:28:24,006
Do I know this person?

995
01:28:25,175 --> 01:28:26,217
Yes.

996
01:28:27,928 --> 01:28:30,554
And does this person like you back?

997
01:28:31,807 --> 01:28:33,975
Not in the same way, I don't think.

998
01:28:35,018 --> 01:28:37,812
The truth is that
I've kissed this person.

999
01:28:37,896 --> 01:28:41,023
But it was just a peck, you know?
Really fast.

1000
01:28:41,692 --> 01:28:43,776
I was embarrassed
and didn't say anything,

1001
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:45,903
and the person
never said anything either,

1002
01:28:45,988 --> 01:28:48,280
so I decided to back off.

1003
01:28:54,746 --> 01:28:58,749
Leo, if you had ever
stolen a kiss from someone,

1004
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:01,127
how would you give it back?

1005
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:02,646
Spartan society was divided into
Spartiates, Perioeci and Helots.

1006
01:30:06,443 --> 01:30:09,820
The Spartiate boys
were sent to the army. . .

1007
01:30:12,324 --> 01:30:13,365
Is this room 21 1 ?

1008
01:30:13,450 --> 01:30:17,036
- Are you William?
- Yes.

1009
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:18,454
Come in.

1010
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:24,752
- Is that seat empty?
- Yeah.

1011
01:30:26,004 --> 01:30:28,631
- Is this backpack yours?
- Yes, it's mine.

1012
01:30:28,715 --> 01:30:29,799
Go on. . .

1013
01:30:31,301 --> 01:30:34,345
The men were dedicated to the army

1014
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:38,599
and would become free
after they reached 60.

1015
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:55,533
Look at that, Leonardo!
The relationship is going strong, huh?

1016
01:31:07,295 --> 01:31:09,380
There you go, douche!

1017
01:31:22,394 --> 01:31:25,646
THE WAY HE LOOKS

1018
01:31:38,451 --> 01:31:39,910
It's clear. Go on.

1019
01:31:40,453 --> 01:31:41,871
Go, go!
