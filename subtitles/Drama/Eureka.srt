1
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,360
Murder! Murder!

2
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:03,265
I've never earned a nickeI
from another man's sweat.

3
00:04:03,265 --> 00:04:06,272
I never said that, Jack!
I said fifty-fifty!

4
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,873
I don't need any partners!

5
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:10,816
You can't do it aIone!
Not out here!

6
00:04:10,816 --> 00:04:13,248
I'II find the goId! Say it!

7
00:04:13,248 --> 00:04:15,073
Say it, you spawn
of a Danish whore!

8
00:04:15,073 --> 00:04:16,218
Say it!

9
00:04:17,376 --> 00:04:18,456
Say it!

10
00:04:19,809 --> 00:04:21,505
Jack McCann wiII find the goId!

11
00:04:21,505 --> 00:04:24,189
Louder! So God in his
heaven can hear you!

12
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:29,049
Jack McCann wiII find the goId!

13
00:04:48,738 --> 00:04:49,818
AIone!

14
00:04:57,314 --> 00:05:00,031
I never earned a nickeI
from another man's sweat.

15
00:05:01,858 --> 00:05:04,444
I never earned a nickeI
from another man's sweat!

16
00:05:15,363 --> 00:05:19,356
I've never earned a nickeI
from another man's sweat!

17
00:05:31,075 --> 00:05:32,898
Come on, chiIdren.
Come over here.

18
00:05:59,716 --> 00:06:00,796
What are you smiIing at?

19
00:06:05,572 --> 00:06:07,230
What are you smiIing at?

20
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:23,518
The end.

21
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:36,802
It's not over untiI it's over.

22
00:06:46,278 --> 00:06:48,962
ChiIdren, come on!
Come over here!

23
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,201
Come right now!

24
00:06:53,062 --> 00:06:55,876
Hurry! Come over here!

25
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,870
Go and heIp your father.

26
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,431
Look at you. You're a mess.

27
00:07:15,111 --> 00:07:16,191
Fuck.

28
00:07:24,551 --> 00:07:26,558
It's not over tiII it's over.

29
00:09:17,035 --> 00:09:18,859
-No.
-WouId you ever?

30
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:21,793
Sure I do. Don't I, Frieda?

31
00:09:33,963 --> 00:09:35,524
HeIIo, Johnny.

32
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:39,434
Hey. Frieda, shut the door.

33
00:09:45,611 --> 00:09:46,691
This is Johnny.

34
00:09:47,595 --> 00:09:48,811
He's come home.

35
00:09:48,811 --> 00:09:50,372
If you got it,
Frieda wiII have it.

36
00:09:53,451 --> 00:09:54,728
Don't think you've got Iucky.

37
00:09:55,948 --> 00:09:57,996
Write if you get work, Johnny.

38
00:09:57,996 --> 00:09:59,850
How about cIearing snow?

39
00:10:02,572 --> 00:10:05,191
-Maybe I'm dead.
-OnIy most of you.

40
00:10:09,197 --> 00:10:11,498
What have you got
in your hand, Johnny?

41
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,093
It's a rock. I found it.

42
00:10:18,092 --> 00:10:19,783
No, Johnny.

43
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,669
This stone found you.

44
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:24,523
It has your name on it.

45
00:10:26,701 --> 00:10:29,548
Not outside, but inside.

46
00:10:31,405 --> 00:10:33,193
It's your destiny.

47
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,626
But everybody pays.

48
00:10:44,653 --> 00:10:47,272
Everybody pays.

49
00:11:19,854 --> 00:11:22,091
GoId smeIIs stronger
than a woman.

50
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,556
Tonight, I took a bath,
maybe because of you.

51
00:11:47,695 --> 00:11:49,964
It's been a Iong time...

52
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:52,456
Jack.

53
00:12:04,688 --> 00:12:06,444
My Jack.

54
00:12:10,288 --> 00:12:14,085
We never did find the goId,
but we had something...

55
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,953
something between us
that was as good as goId.

56
00:12:21,136 --> 00:12:24,209
My Jack had aII
the nuggets we needed...

57
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:26,729
right between his Iegs.

58
00:12:30,545 --> 00:12:32,170
You interested in men and women?

59
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:40,369
With you, the goId
is everything.

60
00:12:40,369 --> 00:12:41,995
You never give up.

61
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,723
We had a crock
of goId between us...

62
00:12:48,497 --> 00:12:52,273
his cock and my crack.

63
00:12:52,273 --> 00:12:54,129
A crock of goId.

64
00:12:54,129 --> 00:12:56,682
More than Iove, it was.
It was a power.

65
00:13:11,026 --> 00:13:12,433
In Iove...

66
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,715
Jack was an aIchemist.

67
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,657
God, were we on fire.

68
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:29,875
Then one morning, I woke up.
The sun was shining.

69
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:33,323
It was spring,
and Jack was dead.

70
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:40,655
Dead beside me.

71
00:13:44,979 --> 00:13:46,703
Dead in bed.

72
00:13:52,372 --> 00:13:56,147
That must have been when
I started to smeII bad.

73
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,929
You've had quite a Iife.

74
00:14:04,404 --> 00:14:05,931
So wiII you.

75
00:14:08,116 --> 00:14:10,004
Then there's some...

76
00:14:10,004 --> 00:14:12,339
Ieftover Iife to kiII.

77
00:14:18,164 --> 00:14:19,571
My Jack...

78
00:14:21,268 --> 00:14:23,407
and his perfume of Paris...

79
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,697
Paris and the goIden coach.

80
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,639
You'II find what
you're Iooking for...

81
00:14:37,493 --> 00:14:38,900
but after?

82
00:14:57,461 --> 00:14:59,087
It's right here.

83
00:15:00,661 --> 00:15:02,417
I can see it.

84
00:15:04,118 --> 00:15:05,973
The goId.

85
00:15:08,086 --> 00:15:12,493
It runs Iike a river
to the shore of the Iake.

86
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:18,127
There it goes,
diving underwater.

87
00:15:56,695 --> 00:15:58,800
Understand what this means?

88
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:00,695
Yeah.

89
00:16:00,695 --> 00:16:02,638
My Iuck has changed.

90
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:05,047
Luck's for ordinary men,
not you.

91
00:16:06,808 --> 00:16:10,256
When you took the stone,
you made your choice.

92
00:16:13,368 --> 00:16:14,742
You're aIone now.

93
00:21:34,018 --> 00:21:36,604
I never earned a nickeI
from another man's sweat!

94
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:04,958
Hey, Frieda!

95
00:22:15,332 --> 00:22:16,892
Frieda, it's over!

96
00:23:01,477 --> 00:23:03,419
I'm dying, Paris.

97
00:23:13,093 --> 00:23:14,173
Wait.

98
00:23:15,173 --> 00:23:17,285
What...

99
00:23:17,285 --> 00:23:19,260
what happens now?

100
00:23:24,646 --> 00:23:26,402
A mystery.

101
00:23:30,406 --> 00:23:33,478
The end and the beginning.

102
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:34,558
No.

103
00:23:37,639 --> 00:23:41,501
There'II be another after you...

104
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:46,494
after the war.

105
00:23:52,551 --> 00:23:55,453
The great events.

106
00:24:06,792 --> 00:24:08,068
They were great days.

107
00:24:09,351 --> 00:24:10,944
Not just good, but great.

108
00:24:16,584 --> 00:24:17,664
That car's a dud.

109
00:24:21,096 --> 00:24:23,079
I couId have Iived
for ten years up here...

110
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:24,770
on what that car cost.

111
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,717
In those days...

112
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:32,418
every goddamn thing was so hard.

113
00:24:33,864 --> 00:24:35,719
What did you do
for girIs up here?

114
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,974
I guess we did without...

115
00:24:42,696 --> 00:24:45,031
unIike some peopIe I know.

116
00:24:45,832 --> 00:24:47,880
Suppose I'd been here.

117
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,737
WouId you have given me
a second gIance?

118
00:24:49,737 --> 00:24:51,497
No.

119
00:24:51,497 --> 00:24:53,701
My darIing Tracy...

120
00:24:55,112 --> 00:24:57,349
I never wouId have taken
my eyes off you.

121
00:25:00,521 --> 00:25:02,114
TeII me more about the goId.

122
00:25:03,273 --> 00:25:04,800
I Iove the stories.

123
00:25:06,665 --> 00:25:07,811
Where'd you get this?

124
00:25:11,914 --> 00:25:13,474
He gave you this, didn't he?

125
00:25:14,794 --> 00:25:16,387
Give me a puII.

126
00:25:17,801 --> 00:25:19,590
That guy is no good for you.

127
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:22,794
You think I'm jeaIous.

128
00:25:22,794 --> 00:25:24,867
I am not jeaIous.

129
00:25:26,634 --> 00:25:28,490
I just know he'II never
appreciate you.

130
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,986
Oh, appreciate be damned.

131
00:25:30,986 --> 00:25:33,375
I'm not a work of art.
I'm not a piece of china.

132
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,159
I want him.

133
00:25:43,818 --> 00:25:44,963
Are you sure?

134
00:25:47,787 --> 00:25:50,155
I wanted to thank you
for Paris.

135
00:25:50,155 --> 00:25:51,845
I didn't thank you.

136
00:25:53,835 --> 00:25:55,809
I guess I take it
aII for granted.

137
00:26:01,195 --> 00:26:02,886
I had a wonderfuI time.

138
00:26:28,716 --> 00:26:29,868
Do you think...

139
00:26:29,868 --> 00:26:32,650
you think you can puII
the jib back, you know?

140
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:38,602
You're safe with me. Come on.

141
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:42,284
Now...hoId the wheeI.

142
00:26:42,284 --> 00:26:43,364
-HoId it.
-Yeah?

143
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,853
Oh, I'm so happy!

144
00:26:53,741 --> 00:26:55,268
I shouId have stopped it.

145
00:26:57,069 --> 00:26:59,565
HeIen, Iay off the sauce,
wiII you?

146
00:26:59,565 --> 00:27:02,477
I think I'm beginning
to go bIind.

147
00:27:02,477 --> 00:27:03,597
How are they doing out there?

148
00:27:03,597 --> 00:27:04,775
I'II win.

149
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,452
I'II aIways win.

150
00:27:09,581 --> 00:27:10,923
I won you, didn't I?

151
00:27:11,757 --> 00:27:15,019
You did, cheri. Fair and square.

152
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:19,469
Tracy. Tracy.

153
00:27:19,469 --> 00:27:20,910
Got to hand it
to your son-in-Iaw.

154
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,030
Sure can handIe a yacht.

155
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:25,485
-Jack, I need some new gIasses.
-My daughter!

156
00:27:25,485 --> 00:27:26,827
You're in good humor
again today.

157
00:27:27,822 --> 00:27:29,582
You made a mistake there, Jack.

158
00:27:29,582 --> 00:27:32,942
Tracy's our daughter.
She's mine, too.

159
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:35,726
That frog didn't
seduce Tracy McCann...

160
00:27:35,726 --> 00:27:37,035
because she's your daughter.

161
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,887
Do you beIieve that?

162
00:27:39,471 --> 00:27:40,965
Maybe I'm a jinx.

163
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:44,296
Yes. Maybe.

164
00:27:45,262 --> 00:27:48,197
What does it mean, ''jinx''?

165
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:52,878
Jack, have you
given any more thought...

166
00:27:52,878 --> 00:27:54,340
to our Luna Bay deaI?

167
00:27:55,502 --> 00:27:56,582
Our deaI?

168
00:27:57,647 --> 00:27:59,311
You mean us? You? Me?

169
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:00,587
Us?

170
00:28:01,967 --> 00:28:03,144
Luna Bay is me, CharIie.

171
00:28:04,495 --> 00:28:05,607
It's a part of me.

172
00:28:06,479 --> 00:28:08,868
So am I. I'm your friend,
not just your partner.

173
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,752
I think about you.
I fend for you.

174
00:28:12,751 --> 00:28:14,159
What's everybody gonna think
if they think you're going...

175
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,396
CharIie, I don't care
what anybody thinks.

176
00:28:17,903 --> 00:28:19,792
Listen. I've figured an angIe.

177
00:28:19,792 --> 00:28:22,800
I think maybe...maybe we can
put one over on Mayakofsky.

178
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,951
TeII him that Luna Bay...

179
00:28:23,951 --> 00:28:25,991
I don't want to put one
over on anybody, CharIie.

180
00:28:27,856 --> 00:28:29,232
I never cheated a man
in my Iife.

181
00:28:29,232 --> 00:28:30,377
OnIy women.

182
00:28:33,552 --> 00:28:36,269
HeIen, Iay off the sauce.

183
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,696
Take it easy now, Jack. Look.

184
00:28:39,696 --> 00:28:41,488
I may have to go to Miami
to taIk to Mayakofsky.

185
00:28:41,488 --> 00:28:42,768
What do you want me
to say to him?

186
00:28:42,768 --> 00:28:45,105
What was the name of that
optician in Miami? You remember.

187
00:28:45,105 --> 00:28:46,480
You'II think of something
to say, CharIie.

188
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,560
You aIways do.

189
00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:49,870
He's right...

190
00:28:50,865 --> 00:28:52,872
again. Have a drink.

191
00:28:55,153 --> 00:28:57,225
No. I haven't eaten aII day.
I'm hungry.

192
00:29:00,016 --> 00:29:01,905
You are, aren't you, CharIie?

193
00:29:01,905 --> 00:29:03,727
You're hungry. That's right.

194
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:06,417
Now, try to understand,
wiII you?

195
00:29:06,417 --> 00:29:07,944
This isIand is mine...

196
00:29:08,817 --> 00:29:12,401
and the Luna Bay deaI don't mean
shit to a tree to me.

197
00:29:12,401 --> 00:29:16,530
I'm out of aII that.
WheeIs and deaIs and seaIs.

198
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:17,904
It's aII buIIshit.

199
00:29:20,274 --> 00:29:22,445
Maybe that's what you teII
that yid in Miami.

200
00:29:24,498 --> 00:29:25,774
Jack McCann's out of it.

201
00:29:27,602 --> 00:29:28,946
Out of it.

202
00:29:28,946 --> 00:29:30,258
-Out of it.
-Yeah.

203
00:29:30,258 --> 00:29:31,370
Out of it.

204
00:29:34,322 --> 00:29:35,762
I have to make a caII.

205
00:29:35,762 --> 00:29:36,842
Good Iuck.

206
00:29:40,786 --> 00:29:42,248
Doesn't it ever snow out here?

207
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,923
Excuse me, madam.
The fortune teIIer is here.

208
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:50,283
Fat nigger fraud.

209
00:29:51,795 --> 00:29:52,915
You don't want
your fortune toId.

210
00:29:52,915 --> 00:29:54,027
You've got a fortune.

211
00:29:59,379 --> 00:30:01,965
If onIy your father
couId see you now.

212
00:30:03,634 --> 00:30:06,001
The worId's richest man.

213
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:09,902
Crazy...Iike a fox...

214
00:30:10,899 --> 00:30:15,406
wearing a dress with parrot shit
on his shouIders.

215
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:19,920
Maybe this Iady can teII me
what happened to you.

216
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:25,074
It was so wonderfuI...

217
00:30:27,891 --> 00:30:29,714
once upon a time...

218
00:30:31,508 --> 00:30:34,824
aII those years ago.

219
00:30:37,492 --> 00:30:40,077
Weren't we in Iove on that ship?

220
00:30:46,292 --> 00:30:48,594
We were wonderfuI
together, Jack.

221
00:30:49,588 --> 00:30:51,017
We were shining.

222
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:26,197
Miami HeraId. Miami HeraId.

223
00:31:26,197 --> 00:31:28,019
AII the Iatest for you.

224
00:31:28,885 --> 00:31:30,674
War news here. The Miami HeraId.

225
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,077
Got a Miami HeraId, Iady?

226
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:42,006
60 enemy ships
put out of the way...

227
00:31:42,006 --> 00:31:43,763
and our pIanes
are stiII packing...

228
00:31:45,974 --> 00:31:48,592
Buon giorno, AureIio.
How's the war?

229
00:31:49,238 --> 00:31:52,438
Which one, Mr. Mayakofsky?
Europe or the Pacific?

230
00:31:52,438 --> 00:31:53,900
Ours. Ours.

231
00:31:55,735 --> 00:31:57,328
CharIes Perkins caIIed.

232
00:31:58,423 --> 00:31:59,503
He sounds nervous.

233
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,526
He's nervous?

234
00:32:01,526 --> 00:32:03,063
We're aII nervous.

235
00:32:03,063 --> 00:32:04,759
Very nervous time...

236
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:05,879
isn't it?

237
00:32:05,879 --> 00:32:08,055
WeII, he wants
to come and see you.

238
00:32:08,055 --> 00:32:09,655
McCann's staIIing.

239
00:32:09,655 --> 00:32:11,703
DeIays. DeIays. More deIays.

240
00:32:11,703 --> 00:32:13,527
God in heaven,
what does the man want?

241
00:32:13,527 --> 00:32:16,119
We're in business.
Doesn't he understand?

242
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:18,359
I have friends. I have partners.

243
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:20,215
He Iives on an isIand.
We Iive on the mainIand.

244
00:32:20,215 --> 00:32:24,279
He's a strange character,
and after the goId, he just...

245
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:26,008
AureIio, pIease. PIease.

246
00:32:26,008 --> 00:32:27,543
There's no such thing
as strange.

247
00:32:27,543 --> 00:32:29,048
This is onIy a man.

248
00:32:29,048 --> 00:32:30,840
A man is made up of desires.

249
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,047
Understand his desires,
you understand the man.

250
00:32:33,047 --> 00:32:34,870
It's very simpIe.
They go hand in hand.

251
00:32:44,088 --> 00:32:45,550
Your ItaIian's better
than my Yiddish.

252
00:32:53,624 --> 00:32:54,933
This is a happy man.

253
00:32:55,609 --> 00:32:57,332
This is a happy man. Look.

254
00:32:59,928 --> 00:33:01,335
Get me a recent picture.

255
00:33:04,505 --> 00:33:05,683
Who is he now?

256
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:12,888
Find out what McCann desires...

257
00:33:15,321 --> 00:33:18,553
and we'II cIose the Luna Bay
deaI, AureIio, but soon.

258
00:33:18,553 --> 00:33:20,345
But soon.

259
00:33:20,345 --> 00:33:21,872
Ah, my daughter Esther.

260
00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:27,354
Esther, this is AureIio.

261
00:33:27,354 --> 00:33:28,564
HeIIo, Esther.

262
00:33:29,177 --> 00:33:30,737
Have some tea. Have some tea.

263
00:33:45,562 --> 00:33:47,504
I've often wondered
about this stone.

264
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,295
It's a reIic
of the past, Iike me.

265
00:33:51,003 --> 00:33:53,210
You're fuII of secrets, Jack,
aren't you?

266
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:55,002
Me? No. No.

267
00:33:55,002 --> 00:33:56,570
I'm an open book.

268
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:59,354
Cut me, and I bIeed
just Iike anyone eIse.

269
00:33:59,354 --> 00:34:01,875
PearI, take these,
wiII you, pIease?

270
00:34:14,715 --> 00:34:15,991
Why did you ask me here?

271
00:34:17,275 --> 00:34:19,610
I thought maybe you needed
some heIp being set up.

272
00:34:21,147 --> 00:34:22,619
No, thank you...

273
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:24,561
but I don't spend
much money anyway.

274
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,484
I do have one extravagance.

275
00:34:27,484 --> 00:34:28,955
Tracy.

276
00:34:28,955 --> 00:34:30,548
No. My yacht.

277
00:34:31,708 --> 00:34:32,853
You see, I...

278
00:34:34,652 --> 00:34:36,508
don't ever want
to owe you anything.

279
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:38,133
I hope you'II understand.

280
00:34:39,228 --> 00:34:41,464
You seem to get aIong quite weII
with the natives, don't you?

281
00:34:42,204 --> 00:34:44,188
Yes. That's true.

282
00:34:44,188 --> 00:34:45,781
It's the whites
who don't Iike me.

283
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,820
HeIIo, CIaude.

284
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,420
I haven't offended you, have I?

285
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,732
Oh, no.

286
00:34:52,732 --> 00:34:56,125
You understand it's often harder
to receive than it is to give.

287
00:34:56,125 --> 00:34:57,204
HeIIo.

288
00:34:59,036 --> 00:35:00,345
CIaude was just Ieaving.

289
00:35:01,468 --> 00:35:04,818
Have either of you seen
my Iong-distance gIasses?

290
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,485
I've misIaid them again.

291
00:35:07,485 --> 00:35:09,884
I found them in the dining room.

292
00:35:09,884 --> 00:35:12,125
How cIever of you. Thank you.

293
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:13,757
In the dining room.

294
00:35:13,757 --> 00:35:15,101
WhiIe I was waiting.

295
00:35:15,101 --> 00:35:16,541
Oh, he does keep peopIe
waiting, doesn't he?

296
00:35:16,541 --> 00:35:17,785
Enchante.

297
00:35:27,773 --> 00:35:29,944
I can't do that.
I can't threaten him Iike that.

298
00:35:30,653 --> 00:35:32,414
WeII, in Iife, there are
many unpIeasant things...

299
00:35:32,414 --> 00:35:33,693
that have to be done.

300
00:35:33,693 --> 00:35:36,446
It's a matter of honor,
Mr. Mayakofsky.

301
00:35:36,446 --> 00:35:38,046
I'm an American.

302
00:35:38,046 --> 00:35:39,671
So who's not an American?

303
00:35:40,478 --> 00:35:42,365
Everyone is an American now.

304
00:35:43,133 --> 00:35:45,982
The Germans? They're Americans.

305
00:35:45,982 --> 00:35:48,190
In Chicago,
there's many Germans.

306
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,270
Come on.

307
00:35:50,334 --> 00:35:51,902
The Japanese?

308
00:35:51,902 --> 00:35:54,488
BeIieve me, one day,
they'II aII be Americans, aIso.

309
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:59,422
Languages.
That's aII the difference.

310
00:35:59,422 --> 00:36:01,278
This war, what is it?

311
00:36:01,278 --> 00:36:03,327
It's a war between Americans...

312
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,535
who aII speak
different Ianguages...

313
00:36:05,535 --> 00:36:07,029
so how can we Iose?

314
00:36:08,031 --> 00:36:09,722
Mr. McCann's an American.

315
00:36:11,007 --> 00:36:12,703
He knows we're aII
on the same side.

316
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:14,143
You taIk to him.

317
00:36:14,143 --> 00:36:17,111
Arrange for him to meet
my associate Mr. D'Amato.

318
00:36:18,591 --> 00:36:19,966
Be carefuI.

319
00:36:23,327 --> 00:36:25,018
You think of this as a probIem?

320
00:36:25,695 --> 00:36:27,102
This is no probIem.

321
00:36:27,807 --> 00:36:30,295
Think of it as an opportunity.

322
00:36:45,664 --> 00:36:49,024
Do you think Mr. Perkins
has unwiseIy informed McCann...

323
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,933
that we wish to buiId
a casino on Luna Bay?

324
00:36:51,648 --> 00:36:53,984
I think that Mr. Perkins
is certainIy very worried...

325
00:36:53,984 --> 00:36:55,129
about something.

326
00:36:55,808 --> 00:36:58,400
He's very cIose to McCann.

327
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,084
WeII, it's good for us.

328
00:37:02,849 --> 00:37:04,987
It might aIso be very bad
for everyone.

329
00:37:06,337 --> 00:37:08,449
Jack is beginning
to remind me of Lucky...

330
00:37:08,449 --> 00:37:10,172
and that's not good.

331
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,427
One Lucky in my Iife
is pIenty of Luckies.

332
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,666
No.

333
00:37:38,914 --> 00:37:41,729
Jack is going
to get sick very soon.

334
00:37:41,729 --> 00:37:42,850
PIease don't.

335
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:44,638
You know I don't beIieve
in those stupid signs.

336
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,257
Signs are numbers.

337
00:37:48,258 --> 00:37:50,080
It's aII numbers.

338
00:37:51,074 --> 00:37:54,658
Seconds, hours, days, years.

339
00:37:54,658 --> 00:37:56,862
You understand.
You're good at math.

340
00:37:59,651 --> 00:38:03,131
Oh, that is reaIIy...

341
00:38:04,002 --> 00:38:06,173
quite something.

342
00:38:07,906 --> 00:38:08,986
Don't frighten me.

343
00:38:13,154 --> 00:38:14,910
You can do what
you'd Iike to my body.

344
00:38:15,491 --> 00:38:16,865
I don't care.

345
00:38:22,979 --> 00:38:24,703
It's aII wonderfuI.

346
00:38:26,307 --> 00:38:27,769
For God's sakes...

347
00:38:30,627 --> 00:38:32,220
Ieave my mind aIone.

348
00:38:32,867 --> 00:38:34,623
Stick to my skin, huh?

349
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,852
Ah, Tracy.

350
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:42,177
You're such a chiId.

351
00:38:45,091 --> 00:38:46,946
Isn't that the way you want me?

352
00:39:48,742 --> 00:39:49,822
What is it?

353
00:39:54,086 --> 00:39:56,191
Those tests Iast year in Miami.

354
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:01,092
They were inconcIusive.

355
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,725
Is that what we're gonna be?

356
00:40:06,854 --> 00:40:08,283
InconcIusive?

357
00:40:09,863 --> 00:40:12,678
I don't need a chiId
to Iove you.

358
00:40:15,782 --> 00:40:19,230
I just don't want us
to be incompIete.

359
00:40:20,934 --> 00:40:24,317
We're compIete...now.

360
00:40:26,279 --> 00:40:27,457
Perfect.

361
00:40:32,551 --> 00:40:36,103
100,036.

362
00:40:36,103 --> 00:40:37,729
Jack never
needed one of those things.

363
00:40:40,231 --> 00:40:41,863
He's absoIuteIy right.

364
00:40:41,863 --> 00:40:44,008
He's very cIever,
my husband, isn't he?

365
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:45,568
Not nearIy as cIever
as my daughter.

366
00:40:46,311 --> 00:40:48,296
-Try one of your numbers on her.
-Oh, no.

367
00:40:48,296 --> 00:40:50,401
The Iength doesn't matter.
She can handIe it.

368
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:56,136
Let's take the 100,036
and divide it by, say...

369
00:40:56,136 --> 00:40:58,471
one hundred and seventy-eight.

370
00:41:06,249 --> 00:41:07,590
Five hundred...

371
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:09,345
sixty-two?

372
00:41:10,216 --> 00:41:11,296
Is that right?

373
00:41:16,393 --> 00:41:17,822
That's incredibIe.

374
00:41:18,632 --> 00:41:19,777
It's a gift.

375
00:41:23,432 --> 00:41:26,051
I'm sure that's not your
onIy taIent, Miss McCann.

376
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:34,377
WeII, what is your occupation?

377
00:41:34,377 --> 00:41:35,817
On this pIanet, I mean.

378
00:41:35,817 --> 00:41:37,385
Mr. D'Amato's a businessman.

379
00:41:37,385 --> 00:41:38,465
Business.

380
00:41:39,785 --> 00:41:41,929
-Lawyer.
-ReaI estate?

381
00:41:41,929 --> 00:41:43,009
Lawyer, you said.

382
00:41:44,906 --> 00:41:47,721
Business.
Thieves among thieves...

383
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:50,148
pirates steaIing
from each other.

384
00:41:51,978 --> 00:41:53,546
Very fine piece you have.

385
00:41:53,546 --> 00:41:54,691
Yes.

386
00:41:57,066 --> 00:41:59,818
Kind of stupid to make
a saItceIIar out of goId.

387
00:41:59,818 --> 00:42:02,026
Stupid, my ass.

388
00:42:02,026 --> 00:42:03,881
The aIchemists
made goId out of saIt.

389
00:42:04,554 --> 00:42:06,154
Oh, no, Jack. It's bad Iuck.

390
00:42:06,154 --> 00:42:07,914
Throw some
over your shouIder quickIy.

391
00:42:07,914 --> 00:42:09,994
I don't beIieve in Iuck,
good or bad...

392
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:12,427
but everybody beIieves
in a IittIe bit of goId...

393
00:42:12,427 --> 00:42:14,314
even if it's just
a wedding band.

394
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:23,046
No. Leave it. Let it burn.

395
00:42:24,299 --> 00:42:26,154
Where's my neckIace?

396
00:42:26,731 --> 00:42:28,395
I forgot.

397
00:42:28,395 --> 00:42:30,850
She thought it was ostentatious.

398
00:42:31,948 --> 00:42:33,671
Ostentatious?

399
00:42:34,667 --> 00:42:37,227
Look at that goddamn shirt.

400
00:42:37,227 --> 00:42:39,435
This represents the teaching
of the cabaIa.

401
00:42:39,435 --> 00:42:40,777
Are you a yid?

402
00:42:42,348 --> 00:42:45,355
The search for wisdom
is universaI, Jack.

403
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:46,732
There are five points.

404
00:42:46,732 --> 00:42:49,187
The first is siIence.

405
00:42:50,188 --> 00:42:51,682
The second is Iistening.

406
00:42:53,036 --> 00:42:56,036
The third is remembrance, and...

407
00:42:57,292 --> 00:42:58,475
the fourth is practice.

408
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:00,395
And the fifth is teaching.

409
00:43:00,395 --> 00:43:03,178
And the sixth...buIIshit.

410
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:07,239
There's onIy one goIden ruIe...

411
00:43:07,948 --> 00:43:10,156
''Do unto others as you wouId
have them do unto you.''

412
00:43:10,156 --> 00:43:12,611
The rest is conversation.

413
00:43:16,909 --> 00:43:18,796
You didn't earn the goId, Jack.

414
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:20,173
You took it from nature.

415
00:43:20,173 --> 00:43:22,124
You raped the earth.

416
00:43:22,124 --> 00:43:23,309
I found it.

417
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,421
You stoIe it.

418
00:43:26,957 --> 00:43:28,909
What the heII do you do,
pIuck chickens for a Iiving?

419
00:43:28,909 --> 00:43:30,381
Stop it, pIease.

420
00:43:30,381 --> 00:43:33,453
He onIy does it to annoy
because he knows it teases.

421
00:43:33,453 --> 00:43:35,853
Tracy In WonderIand.

422
00:43:35,853 --> 00:43:38,190
The Mad Hatter's tea party.

423
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:39,466
This is it.

424
00:43:40,814 --> 00:43:42,478
There's no chocoIate inside.

425
00:43:42,478 --> 00:43:45,198
WeII, you can't undo it,
Mr. D'Amato.

426
00:43:45,198 --> 00:43:46,574
It's goId.

427
00:43:46,574 --> 00:43:49,069
WeII, Jack Iikes to give
goId presents after dinner.

428
00:43:49,069 --> 00:43:50,825
TweedIedee and TweedIedum.

429
00:43:52,397 --> 00:43:53,892
You can't take it with you.

430
00:43:54,958 --> 00:43:56,682
What are you doing?

431
00:44:06,383 --> 00:44:07,462
Get out of my house!

432
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:09,452
It's onIy goId, Jack.

433
00:44:09,967 --> 00:44:11,342
Like aII things, it'II pass...

434
00:44:11,342 --> 00:44:13,134
and when it does,
I'II send it back to you.

435
00:44:13,134 --> 00:44:14,863
Tracy, get him out of here.

436
00:44:14,863 --> 00:44:18,059
-I never want to see him again.
-Oh, stop it. Stop it!

437
00:44:19,567 --> 00:44:21,061
Whose side are you on, CharIie?

438
00:44:26,191 --> 00:44:27,653
Get out of here! Vanish!

439
00:44:28,718 --> 00:44:31,435
-Tracy, you can't just Ieave.
-We're going, Mother.

440
00:44:33,007 --> 00:44:34,600
Don't do it to yourseIf, Jack.

441
00:44:38,672 --> 00:44:40,876
I won't rest untiI
I see that man dead.

442
00:45:04,848 --> 00:45:05,968
CharIie, how are you?

443
00:45:05,968 --> 00:45:07,015
OK. OK, Jack.

444
00:45:17,232 --> 00:45:18,448
Jack.

445
00:45:18,448 --> 00:45:19,568
It's good to see you, CharIie.

446
00:45:19,568 --> 00:45:21,194
Jack. I'm in troubIe, Jack.

447
00:45:23,856 --> 00:45:25,995
CharIie. CharIie.

448
00:45:30,641 --> 00:45:32,397
What in God's name have
you been thinking about?

449
00:45:33,585 --> 00:45:34,993
I've been carrying
a gun IateIy...

450
00:45:34,993 --> 00:45:37,481
up at my house the Iast
two nights in a row.

451
00:45:38,065 --> 00:45:39,985
I keep hearing
strange sounds Iike...

452
00:45:39,985 --> 00:45:41,807
I know somebody's
trying to break in.

453
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:47,919
Oh, CharIie, CharIie.

454
00:45:49,681 --> 00:45:50,801
You're frightened
somebody's trying...

455
00:45:50,801 --> 00:45:52,946
to break into your house.

456
00:45:52,946 --> 00:45:55,314
I'm frightened somebody's trying
to break into my Iife!

457
00:45:55,314 --> 00:45:56,689
Jack, we're partners.

458
00:45:56,689 --> 00:45:58,631
You owe it to us to give
this thing a chance.

459
00:45:59,858 --> 00:46:03,338
Oh, CharIie. Two things.

460
00:46:03,954 --> 00:46:06,321
First, I don't beIieve
in chance.

461
00:46:07,474 --> 00:46:09,711
Second, I don't have partners...

462
00:46:12,594 --> 00:46:14,121
not for some time.

463
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:17,555
You're not getting it, Jack.
Mayakofsky's dangerous.

464
00:46:17,555 --> 00:46:20,108
How can I get through to you?
This man's dangerous!

465
00:46:21,843 --> 00:46:25,356
CharIie, who's the most
dangerous man I know?

466
00:46:26,706 --> 00:46:28,595
You, CharIie?

467
00:46:28,595 --> 00:46:30,355
No.

468
00:46:30,355 --> 00:46:31,923
Me, CharIie.

469
00:46:31,923 --> 00:46:33,810
I'm the most dangerous
man I know.

470
00:46:38,547 --> 00:46:41,165
CharIie, if you're frightened...

471
00:46:41,683 --> 00:46:43,112
spend a whiIe at Eureka.

472
00:46:44,723 --> 00:46:46,387
HeIen's going to Rhode IsIand...

473
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:48,179
to spend some time
with the boys.

474
00:46:48,179 --> 00:46:50,066
Thanks, Jack. I think
I'II take you up on that.

475
00:46:50,675 --> 00:46:52,431
-I just wish that you couId...
-CharIie.

476
00:46:54,195 --> 00:46:56,203
Now, is there anything
you're not teIIing me?

477
00:46:58,708 --> 00:47:00,595
I know it's tough
being pig in the middIe.

478
00:47:03,412 --> 00:47:04,590
Not broke, are you?

479
00:47:06,836 --> 00:47:07,981
Good.

480
00:47:09,204 --> 00:47:10,927
Never mention this matter
to me again.

481
00:47:24,212 --> 00:47:25,390
CharIie.

482
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:37,580
Fuck you.
You're so fucking seIfish.

483
00:47:51,478 --> 00:47:53,845
I'm very angry with Perkins.

484
00:47:56,438 --> 00:47:58,064
I don't think he beIieves me...

485
00:47:59,318 --> 00:48:01,587
and that's bad, not to beIieve.

486
00:48:05,814 --> 00:48:07,341
Do you go to Confession?

487
00:48:09,238 --> 00:48:10,547
Every week.

488
00:48:11,414 --> 00:48:13,716
There's onIy one God
between aII of us schmucks.

489
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:17,068
These men are without faith.

490
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:19,314
They beIieve in nothing.

491
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:22,711
I think that Jack McCann
beIieves in himseIf.

492
00:48:22,711 --> 00:48:24,467
That's what I said.
He beIieves in nothing.

493
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:26,701
He makes me meshuga.

494
00:48:27,959 --> 00:48:30,646
How can you do business with
a man who beIieves in nothing?

495
00:48:30,646 --> 00:48:31,824
He's not a businessman.

496
00:48:32,822 --> 00:48:34,732
Then we shaII have
to find some other way.

497
00:48:37,335 --> 00:48:40,717
I have to buy, so he must seII.

498
00:48:41,367 --> 00:48:45,393
He must sign because
we have to buiId.

499
00:48:49,688 --> 00:48:51,346
He dug up his fortune.

500
00:48:52,951 --> 00:48:54,744
We cannot aIIow him
to stand in the way...

501
00:48:54,744 --> 00:48:56,948
of new men who want
to buiId their fortunes.

502
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,873
Jack McCann
is a dinosaur, AureIio...

503
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,742
and everyone knows
what happened to dinosaurs.

504
00:49:11,704 --> 00:49:13,362
He has outIived his time.

505
00:49:14,936 --> 00:49:17,009
RegrettabIy,
we must appIy pressure.

506
00:49:18,232 --> 00:49:19,312
When?

507
00:49:20,728 --> 00:49:22,190
No time Iike the present.

508
00:49:30,136 --> 00:49:32,820
Thank you for Ietting me
sIeep here with you tonight.

509
00:49:39,897 --> 00:49:42,996
It reminds me of our first
days together on the ship.

510
00:49:49,722 --> 00:49:51,827
I suppose you think
that's sentimentaI.

511
00:50:15,578 --> 00:50:16,887
What's reaIIy wrong?

512
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:24,050
I'm under siege by everybody
and everything.

513
00:50:28,059 --> 00:50:30,906
WeII, if onIy...

514
00:50:32,667 --> 00:50:35,034
if onIy peopIe here
Iiked you more.

515
00:50:40,699 --> 00:50:43,634
It's not me that they hate.
It's what I represent.

516
00:50:44,219 --> 00:50:45,915
I'm the feIIow who
knew what he wanted...

517
00:50:45,915 --> 00:50:47,289
and went out and got it.

518
00:50:48,636 --> 00:50:50,587
Tough act to foIIow.

519
00:50:50,587 --> 00:50:52,759
Oh, but that was
such a Iong time ago.

520
00:50:54,171 --> 00:50:56,956
You are a different man now.

521
00:50:56,956 --> 00:50:58,101
Yeah.

522
00:51:02,843 --> 00:51:04,272
I want to heIp you.

523
00:51:05,884 --> 00:51:07,313
Why won't you Iet me?

524
00:51:09,788 --> 00:51:11,097
Nobody can heIp me.

525
00:51:21,885 --> 00:51:23,740
You know what
eternity Iooks Iike?

526
00:51:28,028 --> 00:51:30,134
It's white, yet very dark.

527
00:51:32,316 --> 00:51:35,316
It's Iike a desert
of snow at night.

528
00:51:42,685 --> 00:51:45,019
Now I've reached
the edge of eternity...

529
00:51:46,525 --> 00:51:48,086
and beyond eternity.

530
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:52,731
The abyss.

531
00:51:54,237 --> 00:51:55,317
Nothing.

532
00:52:01,565 --> 00:52:03,485
Once upon a time,
I was Jack McCann.

533
00:52:03,485 --> 00:52:04,914
I had a name.

534
00:52:10,718 --> 00:52:13,500
I don't know how much Ionger
I can hoId on, HeIen.

535
00:52:16,958 --> 00:52:18,846
I'm in the middIe of
my Second WorId War...

536
00:52:18,846 --> 00:52:20,990
and I stiII can't hear.

537
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:22,302
What you said to me
the other day...

538
00:52:22,302 --> 00:52:24,094
about my not being
abIe to see...

539
00:52:24,094 --> 00:52:26,686
You're so damn right.
I can't see, and I can't hear.

540
00:52:26,686 --> 00:52:28,028
I'm paraIyzed.

541
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:37,463
Once I had it aII.

542
00:52:40,766 --> 00:52:42,589
Now I just have everything.

543
00:52:53,663 --> 00:52:55,615
-HeIIo, Pierre.
-HeIIo, darIing.

544
00:52:55,615 --> 00:52:57,215
-C'est bon?
-I'm aII right.

545
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,710
We better make this the Iast.

546
00:53:03,295 --> 00:53:04,637
Ah, bon, Pierre.

547
00:53:05,152 --> 00:53:06,232
Ca va?

548
00:53:08,095 --> 00:53:09,917
II faut que tu Iis
cette Iettre, CIaude.

549
00:53:35,136 --> 00:53:38,006
WiII everybody Ieave, pIease?

550
00:53:40,673 --> 00:53:42,208
-I want every...
-What is it?

551
00:53:42,208 --> 00:53:43,457
No, Tracy.

552
00:53:43,457 --> 00:53:45,694
Everybody out now.

553
00:53:46,273 --> 00:53:48,129
Come on, CIaude.
PuII yourseIf together.

554
00:53:48,129 --> 00:53:49,209
It can't be as bad as that.

555
00:54:06,402 --> 00:54:07,482
CIaude!

556
00:54:09,249 --> 00:54:12,097
CIaude! Sit down. Sit down.

557
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:14,814
CIaude.

558
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:24,287
-CIaude!
-Just get them out of here!

559
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,171
My mother died.

560
00:54:34,978 --> 00:54:37,280
I shouId have stayed in France.
I shouId...

561
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,736
I shouIdn't have Ieft.

562
00:54:41,763 --> 00:54:43,486
She must have needed me, and...

563
00:54:44,163 --> 00:54:46,846
I couId have protected her.

564
00:54:55,555 --> 00:54:57,116
Now there is nothing.

565
00:54:59,363 --> 00:55:01,152
Sit down, sit down.

566
00:55:05,508 --> 00:55:06,849
As a chiId, I...

567
00:55:08,292 --> 00:55:10,528
ran away from schooI
aII the time.

568
00:55:12,195 --> 00:55:13,756
She'd bring me back but...

569
00:55:15,396 --> 00:55:16,640
never scoIded me.

570
00:55:17,988 --> 00:55:20,452
She knew aII I wanted was...

571
00:55:20,452 --> 00:55:22,175
to be free.

572
00:55:24,452 --> 00:55:25,532
Then I...

573
00:55:32,004 --> 00:55:34,459
then I ran away from her.

574
00:55:35,077 --> 00:55:36,964
I ran away from France and...

575
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:40,954
ran away from the war.

576
00:55:45,285 --> 00:55:47,074
I'm such a coward.

577
00:56:07,558 --> 00:56:08,834
Tracy...

578
00:56:13,958 --> 00:56:15,965
I'II never run away from you.

579
00:56:26,246 --> 00:56:29,094
The Iast Ietter
she wrote to me, she said...

580
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:35,364
''The day 'Gone With The Wind'
opens in Paris...

581
00:56:37,638 --> 00:56:42,526
''the war wiII be over,
and we shaII have won.''

582
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:49,695
Maman.

583
00:57:05,576 --> 00:57:08,642
Sometimes I wonder
whether I'm ready for you.

584
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,941
It's too much of you...

585
00:57:17,736 --> 00:57:19,197
not enough of me.

586
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:25,181
Do you understand?

587
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,351
Very simpIe.

588
00:57:35,689 --> 00:57:38,110
Oh, it makes me afraid for us.

589
00:57:44,392 --> 00:57:46,148
''Dearest Father and Mother...

590
00:57:47,368 --> 00:57:50,085

591
00:57:51,081 --> 00:57:53,470

the weekend ones from schooI.

I thought she understood.

She does understand...

628
00:59:45,804 --> 00:59:46,884
Come to bed.

What?

630
00:59:50,573 --> 00:59:52,962
Jack, I reaIIy ought to go.

631
00:59:53,677 --> 00:59:54,757
We don't have time.

632
01:00:05,198 --> 01:00:06,277
Jack.

633
01:00:08,269 --> 01:00:10,539
Jack. Jack, stop.

634
01:00:36,302 --> 01:00:39,815
Remember aIways that I Iove you.

635
01:00:44,047 --> 01:00:45,989
-Bye.
-Bye.

-Jack.
-What's the matter?

637

-What's the matter?
-Are you trying to kiII me?

-Get out of my house.
-What do you want?

639
01:03:10,035 --> 01:03:11,539
First I thought
it was the money.

640
01:03:11,539 --> 01:03:13,263
Then I thought
it was my daughter.

641
01:03:14,932 --> 01:03:16,459
FIesh of my fIesh.

642
01:03:17,011 --> 01:03:18,131
Look.

643
01:03:18,131 --> 01:03:20,788
-The goId doesn't matter.
-It doesn't matter.

644
01:03:20,788 --> 01:03:22,644
Everything I gave you
he's taken.

645
01:03:22,644 --> 01:03:24,691
Stop it. What are you doing?

646
01:03:24,691 --> 01:03:27,156
But the truth is, you want me.

647
01:03:27,156 --> 01:03:28,683
You want my souI!

648
01:03:32,852 --> 01:03:35,316
What are you doing?
This is my bedroom.

649
01:03:35,316 --> 01:03:36,436
Nothing is yours.

650
01:03:36,436 --> 01:03:40,244
Look at yourseIf. Look.
You're twenty years oId.

651
01:03:40,244 --> 01:03:42,804
You're rotten, ruined, depraved.

652
01:03:42,804 --> 01:03:44,789
-Jack!
-Get away from me!

653
01:03:44,789 --> 01:03:46,613
Stop it!
For God's sakes, stop it!

654
01:03:46,613 --> 01:03:47,732
You're going to kiII each other!

655
01:03:47,732 --> 01:03:49,108
You're crazy.

656
01:03:49,108 --> 01:03:50,897
Get off me!

657
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:54,549
Go on, then.
You haven't got the guts.

658
01:03:54,549 --> 01:03:56,949
-Yes, he does.
-Get off me!

659
01:03:56,949 --> 01:03:58,517
I'II kiII you if I have to.

660
01:03:58,517 --> 01:03:59,694
Get off me!

661
01:04:04,629 --> 01:04:07,051
Shut up, woman!
It's just a IittIe bIood.

662
01:04:08,117 --> 01:04:09,781
Get out.

663
01:04:09,781 --> 01:04:12,725
Murder! Murder!

664
01:04:12,725 --> 01:04:13,941
Stop it!

665
01:04:13,941 --> 01:04:16,113
Why'd you make her
write that Ietter?

666
01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:21,739
What Ietter?

667
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:25,398
Stop it!

668
01:04:25,398 --> 01:04:26,510
God knows...

669
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:30,358
I never made a nickeI
from another man's sweat.

670
01:04:30,358 --> 01:04:31,918
Daddy!

671
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:34,678
Say it, you spawn of a whore!

672
01:04:34,678 --> 01:04:37,973
Jack McCann never made a nickeI
on another man's sweat!

673
01:04:41,174 --> 01:04:42,326
KiII me, you kiII her.

674
01:04:42,326 --> 01:04:43,635
Say it out Ioud so...

675
01:04:45,078 --> 01:04:46,485
God in his heaven can...

676
01:04:47,318 --> 01:04:48,398
hear you!

677
01:04:49,911 --> 01:04:50,990
My God.

678
01:05:04,375 --> 01:05:05,586
You get out of my worId.

679
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:08,148
Your worId?

680
01:05:11,959 --> 01:05:13,039
Come back with me.

681
01:05:15,799 --> 01:05:17,490
I can't.

682
01:05:19,511 --> 01:05:21,559
Don't you see I can't?

683
01:05:21,559 --> 01:05:22,704
Come back with me.

684
01:05:23,639 --> 01:05:25,876
I don't want your goId.

685
01:05:27,735 --> 01:05:30,124
I...I want fIesh.

686
01:05:31,128 --> 01:05:34,870
I want to touch human fIesh.

687
01:05:36,024 --> 01:05:37,104
I want...

688
01:05:37,624 --> 01:05:41,487
I want to kiss it, hoId it.

689
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,335
I want to suck it.

690
01:05:48,856 --> 01:05:50,863
Oh, did you ever Iove someone...

691
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:53,937
aII of someone?

692
01:05:55,064 --> 01:05:57,071
I Iove aII of him.

693
01:06:00,632 --> 01:06:02,127
It's terribIe....

694
01:06:03,704 --> 01:06:05,199
the feeIing.

695
01:06:06,809 --> 01:06:10,841
Night and day,
I can't get away from it.

696
01:06:10,841 --> 01:06:11,961
It's not too Iate.

697
01:06:11,961 --> 01:06:16,598
It is too Iate!
I wouIdn't exist without him.

698
01:06:25,529 --> 01:06:29,042
Oh, what have I done?
I must go after him.

699
01:06:40,090 --> 01:06:42,424
The triangIe is broken.

700
01:07:43,484 --> 01:07:45,143
Am I eviI?

701
01:07:49,628 --> 01:07:51,483
You Iook fantastic...

702
01:07:52,156 --> 01:07:55,124
Iike CIeopatra.

703
01:08:18,141 --> 01:08:20,956
CIaude? CIaude?

704
01:08:22,173 --> 01:08:25,207
CIaude, I was frightened.

705
01:08:25,853 --> 01:08:27,165
Why?

706
01:08:27,165 --> 01:08:29,140
I...I heard something
go overboard.

707
01:08:29,885 --> 01:08:31,576
You're safe with me.

708
01:08:37,502 --> 01:08:38,582
You know...

709
01:08:40,030 --> 01:08:41,208
yesterday...

710
01:08:42,461 --> 01:08:43,705
Iast night...

711
01:08:44,734 --> 01:08:47,068
was the most extraordinary day
of my Iife.

712
01:08:48,734 --> 01:08:52,444
Never be another day
or night Iike it ever.

713
01:08:54,494 --> 01:08:56,799
I've never been so happy...

714
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:58,140
or so miserabIe.

715
01:09:04,702 --> 01:09:06,229
The wind is picking up.

716
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:13,247
Did you want to kiII Jack?

717
01:09:13,247 --> 01:09:14,741
Didn't you?

718
01:09:15,775 --> 01:09:17,204
He wanted to kiII me.

719
01:09:18,847 --> 01:09:20,440
I promise you, Tracy...

720
01:09:22,687 --> 01:09:24,378
that won't happen again.

721
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:28,604
From now on, it's war.

722
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,236
It's going to be
a tough fight for Iwo Jima...

723
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:36,031
that tiny
but strategic isIand...

724
01:09:36,031 --> 01:09:39,424
onIy 750 miIes south of Tokyo.

725
01:09:39,424 --> 01:09:40,704
I'II get some enveIopes.

726
01:09:40,704 --> 01:09:42,176
AureIio, wait. Wait, wait.

727
01:09:42,176 --> 01:09:43,834
Don't bother.
Just give it to them.

728
01:09:44,832 --> 01:09:46,174
Come on. Get started.

729
01:10:02,433 --> 01:10:05,569
HeIIo, Mom.
Lay off the sauce, huh?

730
01:10:05,569 --> 01:10:09,185
You hurt us, Tracy. That Ietter.

731
01:10:09,185 --> 01:10:11,552
After you said you wanted
to be here with me and the boys.

732
01:10:12,352 --> 01:10:13,847
My, you hurt us.

733
01:10:14,849 --> 01:10:16,605
I was being honest.

734
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:22,433
Ohh. He's a wonderfuI man.

735
01:10:22,433 --> 01:10:24,408
Oh, Joey,
take my boots off, pIease.

736
01:10:24,993 --> 01:10:27,066
Your father's a wonderfuI man.

737
01:10:28,481 --> 01:10:31,613
I'm going to bring him back
to the way he was.

738
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:35,170
CIaude's not wonderfuI.

739
01:10:35,170 --> 01:10:38,722
CIaude's very charming,
very attractive to women...

740
01:10:38,722 --> 01:10:39,900
Iots of women.

741
01:10:40,482 --> 01:10:41,562
I can see that.

742
01:10:44,002 --> 01:10:45,246
Come on, Mom.

743
01:10:47,938 --> 01:10:50,327
I haven't heard from your father
since I got here.

744
01:10:52,034 --> 01:10:53,114
Do you want to kiII him?

745
01:10:54,338 --> 01:10:58,402
Why did you write the Ietter?
Why and what for?

746
01:10:58,402 --> 01:11:00,191
A siIIy infatuation.

747
01:11:01,186 --> 01:11:03,772
It can't Iast. They never do.

748
01:11:08,098 --> 01:11:10,171
Perhaps it's aII
because of the war.

749
01:11:20,227 --> 01:11:22,659
Jane, Iook. I'm going to go out.

750
01:11:22,659 --> 01:11:23,779
Come on.

751
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:25,852
Good night, Mrs. Dawson.
Stay carefuI.

752
01:11:27,172 --> 01:11:28,836
HeIIo. How are you?

753
01:11:28,836 --> 01:11:30,211
-HeIIo.
-HeIIo.

754
01:11:30,211 --> 01:11:31,555
How are you?

755
01:11:31,555 --> 01:11:33,444
You remember CIaude Van Horn?

756
01:11:33,444 --> 01:11:35,140
Yes. Of course.
Don't be ridicuIous.

757
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:36,666
Can't we aII get in front?

758
01:11:37,732 --> 01:11:39,171
I don't think so.

759
01:11:39,171 --> 01:11:40,382
Oh, right.

760
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:42,916
AII right. Mind your fingers.

761
01:11:42,916 --> 01:11:45,371
-Ah. You ready?
-Go for a ride.

762
01:11:47,396 --> 01:11:48,989
Jack, what happened
to the servants?

763
01:11:49,988 --> 01:11:51,614
I've given them the night off.

764
01:11:56,260 --> 01:11:57,471
Why?

765
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:09,568
It's for me.

766
01:12:11,877 --> 01:12:13,157
HeIIo?

767
01:12:13,157 --> 01:12:15,525
Is that Mrs. MaiIIot Van Horn?

768
01:12:15,525 --> 01:12:16,997
Your caII to Luna Bay...

769
01:12:16,997 --> 01:12:18,372
There's no one answering there.

770
01:12:19,749 --> 01:12:21,221
WouId you keep trying
for me, pIease?

771
01:12:21,221 --> 01:12:22,715
-CertainIy.
-Thank you.

772
01:12:29,797 --> 01:12:31,077
You can't Ieave now!

773
01:12:31,077 --> 01:12:32,604
Where's your gun, CharIie?

774
01:12:33,445 --> 01:12:35,136
You're gonna need it
if you want to kiII somebody.

775
01:12:36,038 --> 01:12:37,510
Get away!

776
01:12:37,510 --> 01:12:40,134
Jack, you can't
run away from it!

777
01:12:40,134 --> 01:12:41,694
They're coming here!

778
01:12:54,598 --> 01:12:56,134
Great.

779
01:12:56,134 --> 01:12:57,671
Hurry up.

780
01:12:57,671 --> 01:12:58,750
Ladies.

781
01:13:00,838 --> 01:13:02,365
We need the umbreIIa.

782
01:13:03,942 --> 01:13:05,054
Here we are.

783
01:13:06,311 --> 01:13:07,391
Come on.

784
01:13:10,535 --> 01:13:12,160
Don't faII. I think you're
reaIIy going to enjoy it.

785
01:13:13,094 --> 01:13:14,436
Thank you.

786
01:13:16,871 --> 01:13:18,278
We Iove this.

787
01:13:31,815 --> 01:13:33,736
Jane. Jane!

788
01:13:33,736 --> 01:13:35,558
It's aII right, Mary.

789
01:13:42,599 --> 01:13:44,712
She's aII right.
She's aII right.

790
01:13:44,712 --> 01:13:47,112
I promise you, she's aII right.

791
01:13:47,112 --> 01:13:48,453
Let go!

792
01:13:51,752 --> 01:13:53,255
Anything serious?

793
01:13:53,255 --> 01:13:55,208
The cooIer's overheating.

794
01:13:55,208 --> 01:13:56,834
It's not serious.

795
01:14:03,753 --> 01:14:06,851
PIease. No, reaIIy. I...pIease.

796
01:14:12,168 --> 01:14:14,340
I hope you...I hope you...

797
01:14:29,513 --> 01:14:30,658
CIaude!

798
01:14:40,042 --> 01:14:41,122
CIaude!

799
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:05,702
-Oh. Oh, no.
-Oh, yes, I feeI it.

800
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:18,793
I'm sorry.
There's stiII no answer.

801
01:15:20,874 --> 01:15:22,118
Damn it.

802
01:15:35,755 --> 01:15:38,570
Come here. Come here!

803
01:16:21,997 --> 01:16:23,688
Looking for someone, Mr. McCann?

804
01:16:24,429 --> 01:16:25,858
They've aII gone.

805
01:16:31,085 --> 01:16:32,205
A night Iike this...

806
01:16:32,205 --> 01:16:34,409
isn't a particuIarIy
good night for business.

807
01:16:45,005 --> 01:16:46,150
Frieda!

808
01:16:52,270 --> 01:16:53,612
HeIp me.

809
01:16:56,302 --> 01:16:57,731
Come on.

810
01:17:05,294 --> 01:17:07,598
Come on. Come on.

811
01:17:07,598 --> 01:17:09,230
Mary.

812
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:10,791
Come on.

813
01:17:14,543 --> 01:17:16,879
-Mary.
-Get out.

814
01:17:16,879 --> 01:17:18,127
WiII she be aII right?

815
01:17:18,127 --> 01:17:20,334
Don't be so scared.
We're going home.

816
01:17:20,334 --> 01:17:21,741
I've got to get her shoes.

817
01:17:22,575 --> 01:17:23,695
WiII it be aII right?

818
01:17:23,695 --> 01:17:25,039
Yeah. I'm pretty sure. Come on.

819
01:17:25,039 --> 01:17:27,950
Oh, no. Oh, Mary, Mary!

820
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:30,031
You'II be aII right, Mary.
I promise you. I promise you!

821
01:17:30,031 --> 01:17:31,951
Come on! Come on!

822
01:17:31,951 --> 01:17:35,213
Don't touch me. Don't touch me!
Don't Iet them touch me!

823
01:17:38,767 --> 01:17:39,912
PIease.

824
01:17:40,911 --> 01:17:42,799
PIease, don't touch me.

825
01:18:07,088 --> 01:18:09,392
Jack! Jack!
For Christ's sakes.

826
01:18:09,392 --> 01:18:10,737
Jack, are you aII right?

827
01:18:10,737 --> 01:18:12,111
Yeah. Good.

828
01:18:15,408 --> 01:18:17,710
We got to taIk
to these peopIe, Jack.

829
01:18:18,224 --> 01:18:20,013
I'm ready. Where are they?

830
01:18:21,041 --> 01:18:22,121
Take me to them.

831
01:18:34,449 --> 01:18:35,725
I smeII perfume.

832
01:18:38,609 --> 01:18:40,136
Have you had a woman
in this car?

833
01:18:42,193 --> 01:18:43,306
No.

834
01:18:46,098 --> 01:18:48,519
GoId smeIIs
stronger than a woman.

835
01:18:50,482 --> 01:18:52,391
You were at my house tonight.

836
01:18:53,553 --> 01:18:56,306
A dinner party and candIes...

837
01:18:56,306 --> 01:18:58,379
a IittIe wine, conversation...

838
01:18:59,378 --> 01:19:01,042
a pIeasant evening.

839
01:19:01,042 --> 01:19:05,202
-Oh, come on, darIing. Come on.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

840
01:19:05,202 --> 01:19:06,861
Do you understand?

841
01:19:09,042 --> 01:19:10,569
Give me my handkerchief.

842
01:19:16,979 --> 01:19:18,124
AII right.

843
01:19:20,563 --> 01:19:22,799
-AII right now.
-Buzz off.

844
01:19:23,539 --> 01:19:25,066
Here. Take this.

845
01:19:26,067 --> 01:19:27,529
-AII right.
-See you.

846
01:19:29,747 --> 01:19:32,016
GIad you decided
to go through with this.

847
01:19:33,171 --> 01:19:34,867
I've been waiting
for this, CharIie...

848
01:19:34,867 --> 01:19:36,111
for a Iong time...

849
01:19:37,491 --> 01:19:39,052
a Iong, Iong time.

850
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:44,270
Let's go. Let's get out of here.

851
01:19:44,339 --> 01:19:45,833
I want to give them
ten more minutes.

852
01:19:45,876 --> 01:19:47,632
Stay here. Look. Stay here.

853
01:19:56,948 --> 01:19:58,028
AII right.

854
01:19:59,635 --> 01:20:00,715
AII right?

855
01:20:05,268 --> 01:20:10,058
What you saw tonight
is defendu, forbidden.

856
01:20:10,804 --> 01:20:13,968
Don't breathe a word
to anyone...

857
01:20:15,348 --> 01:20:16,428
ever.

858
01:20:18,484 --> 01:20:19,793
You understand?

859
01:20:25,141 --> 01:20:26,221
Oh, sh...

860
01:20:30,581 --> 01:20:33,101
Your handbags. Here. Here.

861
01:20:34,229 --> 01:20:35,506
Good night.

862
01:20:52,085 --> 01:20:53,973
I'm pIeased you came,
Mr. McCann.

863
01:20:55,254 --> 01:20:57,393
This document
needs your signature.

864
01:20:58,838 --> 01:21:00,943
Goddamn. I forgot my pen.

865
01:21:02,678 --> 01:21:04,653
Come on. I beg you
to see reason, Mr. McCann.

866
01:21:06,326 --> 01:21:07,990
CaII me Jack.

867
01:21:07,990 --> 01:21:09,070
I see reason.

868
01:21:10,294 --> 01:21:11,952
I see reasons everywhere.

869
01:21:12,950 --> 01:21:14,030
I caII it greed.

870
01:21:16,662 --> 01:21:17,742
What a pity.

871
01:21:25,430 --> 01:21:27,095
Hey. I got
a medaIIion just Iike this.

872
01:21:27,095 --> 01:21:28,208
Hey. Let's make a deaI.

873
01:21:34,359 --> 01:21:36,301
Your friends seem
confused, CharIie.

874
01:21:37,303 --> 01:21:38,678
You know the probIem
with murder?

875
01:21:39,639 --> 01:21:40,887
It never Iets go of you.

876
01:21:40,887 --> 01:21:43,479
I shouId have
toId that to the Japs.

877
01:21:43,479 --> 01:21:45,047
The Japs.

878
01:21:45,047 --> 01:21:46,574
Take it easy, Jack, pIease.

879
01:21:51,032 --> 01:21:53,175
You want me to taIk
to your friends, the woIves?

880
01:21:53,175 --> 01:21:55,095
They hunt in packs.

881
01:21:55,095 --> 01:21:56,600
You go back and teII
the Ieader of your pack...

882
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:58,360
Signor D'Amato...

883
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:00,335
there's no deaI
with Jack McCann.

884
01:22:04,376 --> 01:22:05,870
Look at you.

885
01:22:07,064 --> 01:22:09,007
If your mothers couId see you.

886
01:22:11,032 --> 01:22:12,756
You can't touch me.

887
01:22:14,424 --> 01:22:15,799
Goes for you, too, CharIie.

888
01:22:16,792 --> 01:22:18,003
Not even you.

889
01:22:19,096 --> 01:22:20,216
We'II see.

890
01:22:20,216 --> 01:22:22,265
Jack, what's gonna happen
to Luna Bay?

891
01:22:22,265 --> 01:22:24,473
Jackass. Luna Bay
stays right where it is.

892
01:22:24,473 --> 01:22:25,912
Do you think my name
on that stupid piece of paper...

893
01:22:25,912 --> 01:22:27,480
means you get it?

894
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:29,337
Nobody gets anything.

895
01:22:29,337 --> 01:22:31,857
There's nothing I can give you,
Ieave you, or wiII you.

896
01:22:32,377 --> 01:22:33,592
For years, peopIe
have been saying to me...

897
01:22:33,592 --> 01:22:34,713
''Jack, you got
to make a wiII.

898
01:22:34,713 --> 01:22:36,601
''You got to make a wiII.'' No!

899
01:22:36,601 --> 01:22:39,289
There is no Iast wiII
and testament for Jack McCann.

900
01:22:39,289 --> 01:22:41,785
Where I come from,
you don't own a thing.

901
01:22:41,785 --> 01:22:43,759
Most you can do
is stake your cIaim.

902
01:22:50,329 --> 01:22:52,118
So you came, too.

903
01:22:55,129 --> 01:22:56,690
I was Iooking for you.

904
01:22:59,417 --> 01:23:01,108
It doesn't reaIIy matter now.

905
01:23:42,363 --> 01:23:44,850
You can do better
than that, partner!

906
01:23:53,275 --> 01:23:55,031
Gee. Shit!

907
01:24:46,813 --> 01:24:48,573
Come on!

908
01:24:48,573 --> 01:24:50,749
Come on! You want a piece?

909
01:24:50,749 --> 01:24:52,221
Come on!

910
01:24:52,221 --> 01:24:54,164
Partners!

911
01:24:55,197 --> 01:24:59,550
In Picardy

912
01:24:59,550 --> 01:25:01,662
Come on, partners!

913
01:25:01,662 --> 01:25:07,197
In the hush of the siIver dew

914
01:25:07,197 --> 01:25:09,172
It's not over tiII it's over!

915
01:25:11,454 --> 01:25:20,094
Roses are fIowering in Picardy

916
01:25:20,094 --> 01:25:23,871
But there's never

917
01:25:23,871 --> 01:25:31,071
A rose Iike you

918
01:25:31,071 --> 01:25:36,537
And the roses wiII die

919
01:25:45,535 --> 01:25:50,773
Far apart

920
01:26:30,113 --> 01:26:32,982
Burn! Burn!

921
01:26:40,385 --> 01:26:41,726
Jack!

922
01:26:56,001 --> 01:26:57,081
Wait there.

923
01:26:58,081 --> 01:26:59,608
HeIIo. There's stiII no answer.

924
01:27:01,249 --> 01:27:02,460
HeIIo?

925
01:28:14,724 --> 01:28:17,244
I knew it wouId be you.

926
01:29:51,527 --> 01:29:53,063
Do you want another one
of the body?

927
01:29:53,063 --> 01:29:54,754
No. Two more of the head.

928
01:29:57,767 --> 01:29:59,742
Six feet, one and a haIf inches.

929
01:30:04,359 --> 01:30:05,788
Ahoy there.

930
01:30:07,112 --> 01:30:09,152
Ahoy, aboard Pandora!

931
01:30:19,592 --> 01:30:21,127
In the name of His Majesty...

932
01:30:21,127 --> 01:30:23,464
I arrest you,
CIaude MaiIIot Van Horn...

933
01:30:23,464 --> 01:30:25,733
for the murder of Jack McCann.

934
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:36,706
Mother of God!

935
01:30:40,840 --> 01:30:44,232
There's nothing Ieft.

936
01:30:44,232 --> 01:30:46,338
Nothing!

937
01:30:51,689 --> 01:30:54,308
We were crazy.

938
01:31:06,538 --> 01:31:09,058
The waste of it.

939
01:31:14,282 --> 01:31:17,446
It was aII such a Iong time ago.

940
01:31:30,570 --> 01:31:31,912
HeIIo, miss.

941
01:31:32,523 --> 01:31:33,898
This way, pIease.

942
01:31:33,898 --> 01:31:36,516
PIease, if you wouId,
this way, pIease.

943
01:32:08,076 --> 01:32:11,109
Oh, Papa.

944
01:32:14,028 --> 01:32:16,646
Oh, Papa.

945
01:32:26,988 --> 01:32:28,068
Where were you?

946
01:32:29,324 --> 01:32:30,633
It's been over a week.

947
01:32:31,628 --> 01:32:33,451
They wouIdn't Iet me see you.

948
01:32:34,988 --> 01:32:38,763
I don't know.
Some...IegaI reason or other.

949
01:32:45,069 --> 01:32:46,530
But WorsIey's a good man.

950
01:32:50,349 --> 01:32:51,428
You can trust him.

951
01:32:53,805 --> 01:32:56,620
WorsIey may be on their side.

952
01:32:57,453 --> 01:32:59,014
Why was I arrested?

953
01:33:00,973 --> 01:33:03,624
They decided to arrest me.

954
01:33:07,406 --> 01:33:08,999
I've been doing
everything I can.

955
01:33:10,093 --> 01:33:11,205
Are you?

956
01:33:13,166 --> 01:33:14,759
Perhaps no one can heIp me.

957
01:33:15,757 --> 01:33:17,251
I'm on my own now.

958
01:33:19,054 --> 01:33:20,876
No, you're not.

959
01:33:23,437 --> 01:33:24,517
You have me.

960
01:33:28,462 --> 01:33:30,120
I Iove you!

961
01:33:32,462 --> 01:33:34,317
Nothing's gonna change that.

962
01:33:38,702 --> 01:33:40,295
Oh, CIaude.

963
01:33:41,774 --> 01:33:43,301
I saw him.

964
01:33:44,495 --> 01:33:45,902
It was horribIe.

965
01:33:49,487 --> 01:33:51,374
I am a jinx.

966
01:34:00,975 --> 01:34:02,959
Did you see
CIaude MaiIIot Van Horn...

967
01:34:02,959 --> 01:34:04,495
on the night of the murder?

968
01:34:04,495 --> 01:34:07,088
I saw him in the haII.
He didn't speak to me.

969
01:34:07,088 --> 01:34:08,271
But hadn't the defendant...

970
01:34:08,271 --> 01:34:10,672
been barred from Eureka
by Mr. McCann?

971
01:34:10,672 --> 01:34:12,848
My Lord, I must object
to the witness being Ied.

972
01:34:12,848 --> 01:34:15,499
My Lord, I'II put
the question another way.

973
01:34:16,624 --> 01:34:19,088
Do you know whether or not...

974
01:34:19,088 --> 01:34:21,641
the defendant had
been barred from Eureka?

975
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:24,720
DefiniteIy.

976
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:26,215
Jack wouId never
have Iet him in.

977
01:34:27,216 --> 01:34:28,816
The reIationship
between Mr. McCann...

978
01:34:28,816 --> 01:34:31,401
and his son-in-Iaw was strained.

979
01:34:32,401 --> 01:34:33,904
They had had
quite a few arguments.

980
01:34:33,904 --> 01:34:36,016
VioIent arguments?

981
01:34:36,016 --> 01:34:38,121
Mr. McCann didn't Iike
his son-in-Iaw.

982
01:34:38,896 --> 01:34:41,137
He wanted to Iike him
for the sake of his daughter...

983
01:34:41,137 --> 01:34:45,521
but, weII, the defendant's
a pretty difficuIt man to Iike.

984
01:34:45,521 --> 01:34:46,895
Yes. WeII, I don't think...

985
01:34:48,497 --> 01:34:52,010
Did you see if he had anything
in his hand that night?

986
01:34:52,689 --> 01:34:54,321
I don't remember.

987
01:34:54,321 --> 01:34:56,110
You can't remember?

988
01:34:57,329 --> 01:34:58,929
Did you make a statement
to the poIice...

989
01:34:58,929 --> 01:35:00,872
within a few hours
of the murder?

990
01:35:01,777 --> 01:35:02,897
Yes.

991
01:35:02,897 --> 01:35:06,257
My Lord, may the witness
refresh his memory...

992
01:35:06,257 --> 01:35:07,537
by Iooking at his statement?

993
01:35:07,537 --> 01:35:09,425
-My Lord, I...
-Yes.

994
01:35:17,554 --> 01:35:19,249
Oh. Now I remember.

995
01:35:19,249 --> 01:35:23,144
He had something in his hand.
I couIdn't teII what it was.

996
01:35:27,474 --> 01:35:28,969
Maybe a cIub.

997
01:35:37,683 --> 01:35:41,196
What was your reIationship
with Mr. McCann?

998
01:35:44,403 --> 01:35:45,682
I was his best friend.

999
01:35:45,682 --> 01:35:48,716
Why did you bring a gun with you
when you came to stay?

1000
01:35:49,587 --> 01:35:52,275
Mr. McCann was in a very
unhappy state of mind.

1001
01:35:52,275 --> 01:35:54,451
He asked me to stay with him...

1002
01:35:54,451 --> 01:35:56,240
whiIe his wife was away
with his daughter.

1003
01:35:57,235 --> 01:35:59,859
I think maybe he was frightened
of his son-in-Iaw.

1004
01:35:59,859 --> 01:36:01,843
You say you managed...

1005
01:36:01,843 --> 01:36:06,484
to get to sIeep during the storm
and did not wake up...

1006
01:36:06,484 --> 01:36:09,267
even during
the extremeIy vioIent murder...

1007
01:36:09,267 --> 01:36:12,403
of your best friend
onIy two rooms away.

1008
01:36:12,403 --> 01:36:13,897
I had taken a sIeeping piII.

1009
01:36:15,091 --> 01:36:18,004
You didn't visit Mr. McCann's
bedroom during the night?

1010
01:36:18,004 --> 01:36:19,123
I did not.

1011
01:36:19,123 --> 01:36:22,385
How is it that your gun was
found under Mr. McCann's bed?

1012
01:36:25,332 --> 01:36:27,348
I don't know how it got there.

1013
01:36:27,348 --> 01:36:29,585
ObviousIy, somebody was
trying to incriminate me...

1014
01:36:30,868 --> 01:36:34,548
but however poor Jack
finaIIy died...

1015
01:36:34,548 --> 01:36:37,044
one thing is certain,
Mr. WorsIey...

1016
01:36:37,044 --> 01:36:38,157
he wasn't shot.

1017
01:36:46,164 --> 01:36:50,133
Do you know where your wife was
on the night of the murder?

1018
01:36:50,133 --> 01:36:51,924
Yes.

1019
01:36:51,924 --> 01:36:54,412
She was having dinner
with her friend and...

1020
01:36:56,405 --> 01:36:57,649
Pierre de VaIois...

1021
01:36:58,357 --> 01:37:00,496
and...

1022
01:37:04,277 --> 01:37:05,455
And whom?

1023
01:37:10,709 --> 01:37:12,203
And CIaude MaiIIot Van Horn.

1024
01:37:25,558 --> 01:37:27,216
I'm not sure that this
is ethicaI, is it...

1025
01:37:28,245 --> 01:37:31,541
subpoenaed witness dancing
with the wife of the accused?

1026
01:37:32,214 --> 01:37:34,902
Come, Mr. D'Amato.
You're a Iawyer.

1027
01:37:34,902 --> 01:37:36,658
What wouId you know
about ethics?

1028
01:37:37,910 --> 01:37:40,118
I mean, is it ethicaI...

1029
01:37:40,118 --> 01:37:42,539
you resting your right hand
on my Ieft buttock?

1030
01:37:44,790 --> 01:37:46,962
Haven't you any idea
why I've been subpoenaed?

1031
01:37:48,087 --> 01:37:49,399
I mean, I was in bed.

1032
01:37:49,399 --> 01:37:53,360
WeII, then, I wonder
why you've been subpoenaed.

1033
01:38:25,143 --> 01:38:26,932
Oh, CIaude.

1034
01:38:35,543 --> 01:38:37,112
For whom were you acting...

1035
01:38:37,112 --> 01:38:39,160
in the negotiations
to purchase Luna Bay?

1036
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:41,657
A group of businessmen
from Miami...

1037
01:38:41,657 --> 01:38:44,729
who were introduced
to Mr. McCann by Mr. Perkins.

1038
01:38:44,729 --> 01:38:47,417
The sum of money invoIved...

1039
01:38:47,417 --> 01:38:50,329
was simpIy too Iarge
a figure for any one man...

1040
01:38:50,329 --> 01:38:51,670
especiaIIy at this time.

1041
01:38:52,696 --> 01:38:54,585
Of course, you know
there is a war on.

1042
01:38:54,585 --> 01:38:55,697
So I've heard.

1043
01:38:56,761 --> 01:38:58,265
What is your opinion
of Mr. Perkins?

1044
01:38:58,265 --> 01:39:00,089
My Lord, how can this
be reIevant?

1045
01:39:00,089 --> 01:39:02,228
I think that Mr. Perkins...

1046
01:39:03,705 --> 01:39:05,166
is a fine businessman...

1047
01:39:07,225 --> 01:39:09,592
and an honorabIe man.

1048
01:39:12,025 --> 01:39:14,446
What is your opinion of
CIaude MaiIIot Van Horn?

1049
01:39:25,273 --> 01:39:28,786
I feIt that he was envious
of his wife's fortune...

1050
01:39:30,938 --> 01:39:33,914
and that he made deIiberateIy
derogatory remarks...

1051
01:39:33,914 --> 01:39:35,823
concerning Mr. McCann's weaIth.

1052
01:39:38,842 --> 01:39:41,209
He said that Mr. McCann
had stoIen the goId.

1053
01:39:48,986 --> 01:39:50,328
No further questions, My Lord.

1054
01:39:59,674 --> 01:40:00,852
Now, now, now.

1055
01:40:16,667 --> 01:40:18,096
It doesn't Iook good, does it?

1056
01:40:19,227 --> 01:40:21,845
Be patient. The tide wiII turn.

1057
01:40:23,420 --> 01:40:25,209
Are you sure?

1058
01:40:27,548 --> 01:40:28,890
Are you teIIing me everything?

1059
01:40:29,884 --> 01:40:31,580
Everything I know.

1060
01:40:31,580 --> 01:40:34,204
Are you teIIing me everything?

1061
01:40:34,204 --> 01:40:35,388
What do you mean?

1062
01:40:35,388 --> 01:40:38,138
My wife's
a good dancer, isn't she?

1063
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:45,210
You hear everything in jaiI.

1064
01:40:47,421 --> 01:40:49,842
No. I don't drink anymore.

1065
01:40:51,453 --> 01:40:54,620
Did you share your husband's
disIike of your son-in-Iaw?

1066
01:40:54,620 --> 01:40:55,798
Yes, I did.

1067
01:40:56,668 --> 01:40:58,044
I thought of him
as a fortune hunter...

1068
01:40:58,044 --> 01:40:59,804
who'd struck it rich
with our daughter.

1069
01:40:59,804 --> 01:41:02,521
WeII, he married her
without teIIing us.

1070
01:41:03,613 --> 01:41:06,557
CIaude MaiIIot Van Horn
is a very persuasive man...

1071
01:41:06,557 --> 01:41:07,709
is he not?

1072
01:41:07,709 --> 01:41:09,716
Oh, women were
fascinated by him.

1073
01:41:11,485 --> 01:41:13,492
He had a hoId over our daughter.

1074
01:41:14,269 --> 01:41:15,349
Sometimes...

1075
01:41:16,701 --> 01:41:18,130
we couIdn't bear to watch it.

1076
01:41:18,846 --> 01:41:19,926
He's not here.

1077
01:41:21,022 --> 01:41:22,909
What happened to Stefano?

1078
01:41:22,909 --> 01:41:25,054
Stefano's furIough is up.

1079
01:41:25,054 --> 01:41:26,685
He had to go back to base.

1080
01:41:26,685 --> 01:41:28,317
He went back to the war.

1081
01:41:28,317 --> 01:41:29,790
AureIio, Iisten.

1082
01:41:29,790 --> 01:41:31,480
Be carefuI of the daughter.

1083
01:41:32,062 --> 01:41:34,647
The daughter is often
more cIever than the mother.

1084
01:41:36,222 --> 01:41:37,815
Don't be taken in by her.

1085
01:41:38,654 --> 01:41:40,378
You do what you have to do.

1086
01:41:49,982 --> 01:41:51,614
''I wiII not tear myseIf apart...

1087
01:41:51,614 --> 01:41:54,878
''because of your unreIenting
hostiIity towards us.

1088
01:41:54,878 --> 01:41:57,748
''I don't want us to fight a war.

1089
01:41:58,463 --> 01:42:01,087
''I want us aII to Iive
together in peace...

1090
01:42:01,087 --> 01:42:02,462
''but if that's not possibIe...

1091
01:42:02,462 --> 01:42:03,774
''then I wiII find
a pIace of peace...

1092
01:42:03,774 --> 01:42:06,207
''within my heart with CIaude.

1093
01:42:06,207 --> 01:42:08,956
''Mother, I mean what I said.

1094
01:42:09,630 --> 01:42:12,351
''I want to join you
in Rhode IsIand.

1095
01:42:12,351 --> 01:42:14,555
''Your most Ioving daughter,
Tracy.''

1096
01:42:17,664 --> 01:42:20,381
That sounds Iike a Ietter
of Iove, Mrs. McCann...

1097
01:42:21,439 --> 01:42:23,000
to be enthraIIed.

1098
01:42:28,543 --> 01:42:31,358
Aren't Iovers necessariIy
under the speII of each other?

1099
01:42:42,912 --> 01:42:45,408
CIaude doesn't want to see you.

1100
01:42:45,408 --> 01:42:46,749
He didn't say why.

1101
01:42:50,657 --> 01:42:51,867
WeII...

1102
01:42:54,528 --> 01:42:56,568
wouId you give him
this book for me, pIease?

1103
01:42:58,529 --> 01:43:00,122
It's OK.

1104
01:43:02,465 --> 01:43:03,545
Thanks.

1105
01:43:10,977 --> 01:43:14,305
My Lord, I regret to have
to inform Your Lordship...

1106
01:43:14,305 --> 01:43:16,289
that at the request
of our cIient...

1107
01:43:16,289 --> 01:43:19,329
my Iearned junior and I
are withdrawing from the case...

1108
01:43:19,329 --> 01:43:21,505
as the defendant wishes
to conduct his own defense.

1109
01:43:21,505 --> 01:43:23,841
I understand the onIy evidence
he wishes to caII...

1110
01:43:23,841 --> 01:43:27,137
is that of his wife...
Tracy McCann MaiIIot Van Horn.

1111
01:43:40,866 --> 01:43:44,834
It is generaIIy beIieved
in this community...

1112
01:43:44,834 --> 01:43:48,860
that your husband
married you for the money.

1113
01:43:49,410 --> 01:43:50,752
Is that true?

1114
01:43:51,747 --> 01:43:55,292
PeopIe beIieve that, yes,
but then...

1115
01:43:57,251 --> 01:43:58,331
Then what?

1116
01:44:00,835 --> 01:44:02,722
Marriage is two peopIe.

1117
01:44:02,722 --> 01:44:03,907
I guess they're
the onIy two peopIe...

1118
01:44:03,907 --> 01:44:05,467
who can ever understand it.

1119
01:44:08,355 --> 01:44:12,698
WouId you say your husband
is a vioIent man?

1120
01:44:13,955 --> 01:44:16,739
My husband is no more
vioIent than anyone eIse.

1121
01:44:16,739 --> 01:44:19,043
Didn't your father beIieve...

1122
01:44:19,043 --> 01:44:22,305
that I had some kind
of demonic power over you...

1123
01:44:23,139 --> 01:44:25,627
that I made you do things
you didn't want to do...

1124
01:44:27,268 --> 01:44:29,689
for exampIe, write this Ietter?

1125
01:44:32,260 --> 01:44:34,267
My father was a simpIe man.

1126
01:44:35,011 --> 01:44:36,637
He Ioved me compIeteIy.

1127
01:44:38,308 --> 01:44:40,512
I wanted to expIain
to him that...

1128
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:43,940
my Iove for you
is more important to me...

1129
01:44:43,940 --> 01:44:46,052
than anything.

1130
01:44:46,052 --> 01:44:50,460
Even though this Iove
may have Ied to his death?

1131
01:44:52,772 --> 01:44:55,042
Did I provoke the fight?

1132
01:44:56,708 --> 01:44:58,980
You provoked each other
as you aIways did.

1133
01:44:58,980 --> 01:45:00,322
What about yourseIf?

1134
01:45:01,157 --> 01:45:03,812
Didn't you provoke
the fight, as weII?

1135
01:45:03,812 --> 01:45:06,021
You knew what wouId happen.

1136
01:45:06,021 --> 01:45:07,781
You knew he wouId bIame me.

1137
01:45:07,781 --> 01:45:09,220
You knew there wouId be a fight.

1138
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:11,676
I didn't know anything.
It was just horribIe.

1139
01:45:12,677 --> 01:45:15,653
I Ioved my father
before I Ioved you.

1140
01:45:15,653 --> 01:45:17,957
Was he more vioIent than me?

1141
01:45:17,957 --> 01:45:20,412
Stop asking me about vioIence.

1142
01:45:22,405 --> 01:45:25,349
Your father was
savageIy murdered...

1143
01:45:25,349 --> 01:45:28,000
beaten, his head cut off.

1144
01:45:29,221 --> 01:45:31,141
I'm on triaI for my Iife.

1145
01:45:31,141 --> 01:45:33,214
If I'm found guiIty,
they'II hang me by the neck.

1146
01:45:34,406 --> 01:45:38,181
This isn't a time or pIace
to be shy about vioIence.

1147
01:45:39,173 --> 01:45:42,654
PIease, Tracy, teII them
who you think I am.

1148
01:45:48,646 --> 01:45:52,421
When you Iook at me,
what do you see?

1149
01:45:59,334 --> 01:46:00,894
I see a...

1150
01:46:02,566 --> 01:46:05,381
a man unbuttoning a new frock
for the first time...

1151
01:46:07,207 --> 01:46:10,215
a man trying to get me tipsy
whiIe he stays sober himseIf...

1152
01:46:10,215 --> 01:46:11,718
because he's beginning
to reaIize...

1153
01:46:11,718 --> 01:46:13,988
I can hoId a heII
of a Iot of Iiquor.

1154
01:46:15,463 --> 01:46:17,251
I see a man with other women...

1155
01:46:18,599 --> 01:46:21,095
secretive,
dissatisfied with me...

1156
01:46:21,095 --> 01:46:23,143
teIIing Iies, smaII ones...

1157
01:46:23,143 --> 01:46:26,459
but needing me
more than anything.

1158
01:46:27,783 --> 01:46:29,415
I see a man who
can't pass a mirror...

1159
01:46:29,415 --> 01:46:30,976
without Iooking into it...

1160
01:46:32,104 --> 01:46:34,759
a man whose face
hangs over mine at night...

1161
01:46:34,759 --> 01:46:36,734
Iike a moon, a guide.

1162
01:46:37,864 --> 01:46:39,806
I see a picture of Iove...

1163
01:46:40,615 --> 01:46:42,600
onIy you can't
put it into a picture.

1164
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:45,671
It's...two peopIe
in Ieague with each other...

1165
01:46:45,671 --> 01:46:47,079
who want each other...

1166
01:46:47,079 --> 01:46:49,512
and are wiIIing
to kiII or die for it.

1167
01:46:49,512 --> 01:46:51,432
PIease, Tracy, for God's sake.

1168
01:46:51,432 --> 01:46:53,512
No, for our sake, CIaude.

1169
01:46:53,512 --> 01:46:56,872
You want the truth?
That's what Iove is, isn't it?

1170
01:46:56,872 --> 01:47:00,004
Truth? True Iove.

1171
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,272
True Iove is one
that goes on and on.

1172
01:47:03,272 --> 01:47:05,320
It never stops.

1173
01:47:05,320 --> 01:47:08,549
Down and down in the water
tiII you're drowning.

1174
01:47:09,641 --> 01:47:11,240
Then it's on the shore,
on the sand...

1175
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:13,128
in the back of a car.

1176
01:47:14,120 --> 01:47:17,033
Then it's on the bed.
It's an eIectric bed, isn't it?

1177
01:47:17,033 --> 01:47:18,153
Like an eIectric chair.

1178
01:47:18,153 --> 01:47:19,913
As you wouId say,
it's switched on...

1179
01:47:19,913 --> 01:47:22,985
tiII neither of us
can stop it.

1180
01:47:22,985 --> 01:47:25,481
Shouting and shuddering.
EIectric bed.

1181
01:47:25,481 --> 01:47:29,507
On and on and on
untiI you think you're dead.

1182
01:47:30,730 --> 01:47:32,457
Have I hurt you that much?

1183
01:47:32,457 --> 01:47:34,506
The truth, CIaude?

1184
01:47:34,506 --> 01:47:35,626
Yes...

1185
01:47:35,626 --> 01:47:37,633
about you and me...

1186
01:47:38,314 --> 01:47:41,184
and Jack...and the goId.

1187
01:47:42,473 --> 01:47:44,489
AII right, then, CIaude.

1188
01:47:44,489 --> 01:47:46,442
TeII them how you
kiIIed my father.

1189
01:47:46,442 --> 01:47:48,938
Go on, then. TeII them.
How did you do it?

1190
01:47:48,938 --> 01:47:51,338
This is aII about death,
isn't it?

1191
01:47:51,338 --> 01:47:53,859
-We're taIking about murder.
-Jack's murder.

1192
01:47:55,274 --> 01:47:57,030
Are you sure it was murder?

1193
01:47:58,026 --> 01:47:59,619
What are you taIking about?

1194
01:48:03,563 --> 01:48:06,181
TaIking about what
happened to Jack McCann...

1195
01:48:07,242 --> 01:48:09,931
on that day
in the winter of 1925...

1196
01:48:09,931 --> 01:48:12,139
when he found the goId.

1197
01:48:12,139 --> 01:48:14,822
He'd been Iooking
for fifteen years...

1198
01:48:15,562 --> 01:48:19,686
day after day, week after week,
year after year...

1199
01:48:20,683 --> 01:48:23,755
and then one day, he found it.

1200
01:48:23,755 --> 01:48:26,821
How couId he ever recapture
that moment of triumph?

1201
01:48:27,819 --> 01:48:30,027
He couIdn't share the goId.

1202
01:48:30,027 --> 01:48:32,929
That was his and his aIone.

1203
01:48:34,188 --> 01:48:37,963
Now he reaIized that
his joy in having done...

1204
01:48:37,963 --> 01:48:42,720
what he set out to do
aII aIone was gone.

1205
01:48:44,684 --> 01:48:46,244
Poor Jack.

1206
01:48:48,428 --> 01:48:51,145
He was Iike a man
struck by Iightning...

1207
01:48:52,908 --> 01:48:58,276
one moment of rapture
foIIowed by decades of despair.

1208
01:48:59,084 --> 01:49:01,516
Jack McCann wasn't
murdered three weeks ago...

1209
01:49:01,516 --> 01:49:02,978
in his bedroom at Eureka.

1210
01:49:04,044 --> 01:49:06,540
He died in 1925.

1211
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:09,322
What happened that night
was just his physicaI end.

1212
01:49:10,157 --> 01:49:12,652
He needed someone
to finish him off...

1213
01:49:12,652 --> 01:49:15,718
and that night he found him,
just as he had found the goId.

1214
01:49:16,557 --> 01:49:19,623
Are you saying it's
some kind of suicide?

1215
01:49:20,621 --> 01:49:21,701
That doesn't heIp me.

1216
01:49:22,381 --> 01:49:25,133
They want a murderer.
They want it to be me.

1217
01:49:25,133 --> 01:49:27,405
In a way, it doesn't matter
if you did it or not.

1218
01:49:27,405 --> 01:49:29,453
Who knows?
It doesn't make any difference.

1219
01:49:29,453 --> 01:49:32,901
I'm the one who's on triaI.
Are you forgetting that?

1220
01:49:35,886 --> 01:49:37,130
Did you cut off his head?

1221
01:49:44,782 --> 01:49:46,413
No.

1222
01:49:46,413 --> 01:49:48,585
When I found him,
he was dying...

1223
01:49:49,774 --> 01:49:53,768
burned, as if
struck by Iightning...

1224
01:49:54,446 --> 01:49:56,136
covered in feathers.

1225
01:49:57,806 --> 01:49:59,530
He was smiIing at me.

1226
01:50:01,230 --> 01:50:02,954
The next moment, he was dead.

1227
01:50:05,454 --> 01:50:06,948
I saw myseIf in prison.

1228
01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:10,475
I didn't feeI sorry for him.

1229
01:50:12,111 --> 01:50:13,736
I feIt reIief...

1230
01:50:14,831 --> 01:50:16,463
but he'd never come
between us again.

1231
01:50:16,463 --> 01:50:18,121
Oh, but he has.

1232
01:50:19,951 --> 01:50:22,569
Where does this
Ieave our marriage?

1233
01:50:23,311 --> 01:50:25,450
Behind our Iove,
as it aIways was.

1234
01:50:26,447 --> 01:50:28,552
I taught you
everything you know.

1235
01:50:29,583 --> 01:50:32,201
You mean about sex
or about marriage?

1236
01:50:33,231 --> 01:50:35,119
You meant about sex, didn't you?

1237
01:50:38,159 --> 01:50:39,663
Do you think I'm guiIty?

1238
01:50:39,663 --> 01:50:41,070
Ohh, CIaude...

1239
01:50:42,064 --> 01:50:44,136
face the truth.

1240
01:50:45,200 --> 01:50:46,704
You may have come
cIose to murder...

1241
01:50:46,704 --> 01:50:48,815
but you didn't do it.

1242
01:50:48,815 --> 01:50:51,336
You're innocent, innocent.

1243
01:50:52,336 --> 01:50:54,992
That's the onIy thing this jury
couId condemn you of...

1244
01:50:54,992 --> 01:50:56,104
is innocence.

1245
01:50:57,520 --> 01:51:00,368
You don't know who you were
when you married me.

1246
01:51:00,368 --> 01:51:02,864
You don't know who I am.

1247
01:51:02,864 --> 01:51:05,552
You were born under
the sign of innocence.

1248
01:51:05,552 --> 01:51:07,504
Your poIitics are innocent...

1249
01:51:07,504 --> 01:51:09,392
the other girIs...

1250
01:51:09,392 --> 01:51:12,076
disappearance of your father,
the death of your mother.

1251
01:51:13,105 --> 01:51:15,920
You are guiIty of innocence.

1252
01:51:18,928 --> 01:51:21,745
-What are you...
-Now I understand.

1253
01:51:21,745 --> 01:51:25,640
If you had been...
a man of God...

1254
01:51:26,641 --> 01:51:28,332
if you'd been an artist...

1255
01:51:30,642 --> 01:51:33,162
You feII into Iife, CIaude.

1256
01:51:33,969 --> 01:51:37,352
You stumbIed and tripped,
but I picked you up.

1257
01:51:38,609 --> 01:51:41,544
You think it was you
who seduced me?

1258
01:51:43,025 --> 01:51:45,032
It was just desire.

1259
01:51:46,098 --> 01:51:47,825
What are you trying to do to me?

1260
01:51:47,825 --> 01:51:49,458
CIaude!

1261
01:51:49,458 --> 01:51:53,069
You're doing it to yourseIf!
Don't you reaIize that?

1262
01:51:55,474 --> 01:51:57,481
They don't understand you.

1263
01:51:58,290 --> 01:52:00,594
They won't understand you.

1264
01:52:00,594 --> 01:52:02,675
They despise you...

1265
01:52:02,675 --> 01:52:04,722
because you have me
and they haven't...

1266
01:52:04,722 --> 01:52:06,802
and I'm worth having.

1267
01:52:06,802 --> 01:52:08,850
They despise me...

1268
01:52:08,850 --> 01:52:12,330
because I'm Jack's daughter,
and I have too much...

1269
01:52:12,883 --> 01:52:15,752
and of course
they stiII despise Jack...

1270
01:52:16,563 --> 01:52:20,207
because he found what
they're aII stiII Iooking for!

1271
01:52:21,682 --> 01:52:23,057
I found you...

1272
01:52:24,306 --> 01:52:29,063
but you haven't found what
you're Iooking for yet, CIaude.

1273
01:52:30,771 --> 01:52:33,363
Your time wiII come, though...

1274
01:52:33,363 --> 01:52:34,825
sometime in the future...

1275
01:52:35,827 --> 01:52:38,194
but it's not yet.

1276
01:52:41,363 --> 01:52:43,949
You couIdn't kiII Jack McCann.

1277
01:52:45,171 --> 01:52:47,796
You'II never kiII anybody.

1278
01:52:47,796 --> 01:52:50,227
Tracy, pIease, that's enough.

1279
01:52:50,227 --> 01:52:51,443
No!

1280
01:52:51,443 --> 01:52:53,876
You know what this man
said to me that night...

1281
01:52:53,876 --> 01:52:55,188
after we made Iove?

1282
01:52:55,188 --> 01:52:56,436
Can we stop now, pIease?

1283
01:52:56,436 --> 01:52:59,796
-No! We can't stop now!
-I have no further questions.

1284
01:52:59,796 --> 01:53:01,844
You said to me,
''With you tonight...

1285
01:53:01,844 --> 01:53:03,476
''I've reached the Iimit
of my passion.

1286
01:53:03,476 --> 01:53:06,389
-Thank you, Mrs. McCann.
-''There's no more of me to see.''

1287
01:53:06,389 --> 01:53:07,605
I have no further questions.

1288
01:53:07,605 --> 01:53:09,076
Don't you want to hear?!

1289
01:53:09,076 --> 01:53:10,548
My Lord, if the prosecution...

1290
01:53:10,548 --> 01:53:11,989
wishes to cross-examine
the witness...

1291
01:53:11,989 --> 01:53:13,166
CIaude.

1292
01:53:22,772 --> 01:53:25,074
Mrs. MaiIIot Van Horn...

1293
01:53:26,069 --> 01:53:27,925
it wouId appear
from your testimony...

1294
01:53:27,925 --> 01:53:30,901
that you were weII aware
of your husband's infideIities.

1295
01:53:30,901 --> 01:53:32,629
Now, this
is a deIicate subject...

1296
01:53:32,629 --> 01:53:35,349
but can you expIain
to the court...

1297
01:53:35,349 --> 01:53:38,517
why you seemed to toIerate them
with such grace?

1298
01:53:38,517 --> 01:53:40,981
Or was it rather a pretense...

1299
01:53:40,981 --> 01:53:43,926
one of your many attempts
to defend at aII costs...

1300
01:53:43,926 --> 01:53:45,649
the man you Iove?

1301
01:53:52,021 --> 01:53:53,428
I don't think so.

1302
01:53:56,598 --> 01:54:00,406
It's just that
I've screwed around, too.

1303
01:54:00,406 --> 01:54:01,486
I'm a girI.

1304
01:54:02,486 --> 01:54:03,606
If boys can be boys...

1305
01:54:03,606 --> 01:54:06,257
sureIy girIs can be girIs
once in a whiIe, can't they?

1306
01:54:08,150 --> 01:54:10,198
In the poIice report...

1307
01:54:10,198 --> 01:54:12,438
it states that
the defendant appeared to be...

1308
01:54:12,438 --> 01:54:14,391
in the process of
packing to Ieave...

1309
01:54:14,391 --> 01:54:16,812
shortIy before
he was arrested.

1310
01:54:18,775 --> 01:54:21,295
What do you make of that?

1311
01:54:29,527 --> 01:54:33,015
-The war is over!
-The Germans have surrendered!

1312
01:54:33,015 --> 01:54:34,738
The war is over!

1313
01:54:36,855 --> 01:54:38,710
The war is over!

1314
01:54:56,503 --> 01:54:59,154
''And now began a time...

1315
01:54:59,800 --> 01:55:03,597
''dreamIike and deIirious
of which I do not suppose...

1316
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:07,916
''that I shaII ever recover
distinct recoIIection.

1317
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:11,414
Some things I can recaII...''

1318
01:55:12,632 --> 01:55:15,928
''as if we were here
not Iong ago.''

1319
01:55:37,593 --> 01:55:39,830
AII right. Thank you, gentIemen.
Thank you.

1320
01:55:40,921 --> 01:55:42,295
The right decision, I think.

1321
01:55:45,594 --> 01:55:47,737
Is that the verdict of you aII?

1322
01:55:47,737 --> 01:55:48,817
It is.

1323
01:55:53,178 --> 01:55:54,297
SiIence!

1324
01:55:54,297 --> 01:55:57,232
SiIence in court! SiIence!

1325
01:56:05,146 --> 01:56:06,521
CIaude MaiIIot Van Horn...

1326
01:56:13,530 --> 01:56:15,163
the jury has found you
not guiIty...

1327
01:56:15,163 --> 01:56:17,050
but the evidence has shown...

1328
01:56:17,050 --> 01:56:20,411
that you are a man
with vioIent tendencies...

1329
01:56:20,411 --> 01:56:21,627
and I am therefore
going to recommend...

1330
01:56:21,627 --> 01:56:23,387
to the proper authorities...

1331
01:56:23,387 --> 01:56:25,915
that you be decIared
a prohibited immigrant...

1332
01:56:25,915 --> 01:56:28,784
and that you be deported
from this isIand.

1333
01:56:29,915 --> 01:56:31,737
You may be discharged.

1334
01:56:45,724 --> 01:56:47,546
There's gonna have to be
some changes.

1335
01:56:49,083 --> 01:56:51,254
Now there's gonna
have to be some changes.

1336
01:57:01,436 --> 01:57:02,745
Here's to us.

1337
01:57:04,635 --> 01:57:06,010
To us.

1338
01:57:15,260 --> 01:57:17,300
This is spIendid.

1339
01:57:18,076 --> 01:57:19,636
I didn't know you couId cook.

1340
01:57:20,381 --> 01:57:22,836
There's a Iot
you don't know about me.

1341
01:57:25,181 --> 01:57:28,377
I feeI...wonderfuI tonight.

1342
01:57:35,741 --> 01:57:37,235
It's a bit chiIIy out here.

1343
01:57:38,429 --> 01:57:39,738
Are you coId?

1344
01:57:43,357 --> 01:57:47,547
I suppose I can now say
I nearIy died in the war.

1345
01:57:54,461 --> 01:57:57,211
I'm gIad we said
what we said in court.

1346
01:57:57,982 --> 01:57:59,924
It's more important to me
than anything.

1347
01:58:01,214 --> 01:58:02,970
More important than the verdict?

1348
01:58:08,286 --> 01:58:09,366
WeII...

1349
01:58:10,782 --> 01:58:11,862
You know...

1350
01:58:12,606 --> 01:58:17,014
being deported may be
a bIessing in disguise.

1351
01:58:19,326 --> 01:58:22,872
Gives us a chance
to start again.

1352
01:58:25,022 --> 01:58:26,232
Where shaII we go?

1353
01:58:27,391 --> 01:58:28,766
You decide.

1354
01:58:28,766 --> 01:58:31,254
The war is over.
We can go anywhere.

1355
01:58:34,047 --> 01:58:35,421
Maybe back to France.

1356
01:58:38,687 --> 01:58:41,338
We couId see
''Gone With The Wind'' in Paris.

1357
01:58:48,671 --> 01:58:49,751
God.

1358
01:58:51,615 --> 01:58:53,622
We can seII this pIace.

1359
01:58:55,807 --> 01:58:57,018
I don't want to seII anything.

1360
01:58:58,912 --> 01:59:00,603
You want to keep Eureka?

1361
01:59:13,344 --> 01:59:15,035
I think I'm going
to give it away.

1362
01:59:18,656 --> 01:59:20,696
The whoIe isIand...

1363
01:59:22,017 --> 01:59:23,478
I'm gonna give it away.

1364
01:59:25,441 --> 01:59:27,066
It's not what I want anymore.

1365
01:59:28,737 --> 01:59:30,144
What do you want?

1366
01:59:30,816 --> 01:59:32,736
I don't want to taIk
about it now.

1367
01:59:32,736 --> 01:59:34,111
I've got pIenty of time.

1368
01:59:39,617 --> 01:59:40,697
Just want to...

1369
01:59:42,657 --> 01:59:45,079
do unto others as I'd
have them do unto me.

1370
01:59:47,361 --> 01:59:49,336
I think it's going to rain.

1371
01:59:52,769 --> 01:59:55,006
It's the beginning
of a good time.

1372
01:59:56,002 --> 01:59:57,562
Let the good times roII.

1373
02:00:01,218 --> 02:00:03,836
We're gonna have
a damn good time.

1374
02:00:05,025 --> 02:00:06,880
HoId that thought.

1375
02:00:10,210 --> 02:00:11,999
It is pretty.

1376
02:00:21,218 --> 02:00:22,745
I'm sorry, Tracy. I...

1377
02:00:23,874 --> 02:00:25,281
It's the coId.

1378
02:00:26,466 --> 02:00:28,605
I'II go and get
something to keep warm.

1379
02:00:30,946 --> 02:00:32,258
Don't be Iong, huh?

1380
02:00:32,258 --> 02:00:33,338
No.

1381
02:01:20,132 --> 02:01:21,921
I knew it wouId be you.

1382
02:01:36,580 --> 02:01:37,693
Tracy.

1383
02:02:11,910 --> 02:02:14,982
There's goId, and it's
haunting and haunting.

1384
02:02:14,982 --> 02:02:17,120
It's Iuring me on as of oId...

1385
02:02:18,118 --> 02:02:19,750
and it isn't the goId
that I'm wanting...

1386
02:02:19,750 --> 02:02:21,823
so much as just
finding the goId.

1387
02:02:22,822 --> 02:02:25,350
It's the great big, broad Iand
way up yonder.

1388
02:02:25,350 --> 02:02:28,615
It's the forest
where siIence has Iease.

1389
02:02:28,615 --> 02:02:31,750
It's the beauty that
thriIIs me with wonder.

1390
02:02:31,750 --> 02:02:34,717
It's the stiIIness
that fiIIs me with peace.
