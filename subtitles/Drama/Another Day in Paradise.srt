2
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,344
Come here,
you little fucking bastard!

3
00:04:58,389 --> 00:04:59,253
Get up!

4
00:05:11,068 --> 00:05:12,433
Come here, you mother fucker!

5
00:05:16,874 --> 00:05:18,136
You little mother fucker!

6
00:05:25,249 --> 00:05:26,716
I am going to fucking kill you!

7
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:02,350
Oh fuck.

8
00:06:02,386 --> 00:06:03,478
Oh my God!

9
00:07:55,632 --> 00:07:57,532
Oh my God!

10
00:07:57,568 --> 00:07:59,900
Oh my God! Bobbie!

11
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,740
Oh shit! Fucking no!

12
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:04,900
Oh my God!

13
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,510
Oh God baby,
what happened to you?

14
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,207
I'm gonna get my Uncle Mel,
he used to be a medic.

15
00:08:12,249 --> 00:08:13,773
Got guys through combat
and shit.

16
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:19,889
You're going to be okay, Kid.

17
00:08:19,923 --> 00:08:21,823
Your old uncle Mel is here.

18
00:08:21,859 --> 00:08:24,225
Just kick back.

19
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:25,888
I don't have any morphine...

20
00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:28,454
but this is some
of the best smack around.

21
00:08:28,499 --> 00:08:29,761
If this don't kill the pain...

22
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,234
nothing will.

23
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:34,965
- You're a doctor, Melvin?
- Yeah.

24
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,040
Yeah, I'm a doctor shooting
you up with heroin.

25
00:08:38,075 --> 00:08:39,906
That's right.

26
00:08:41,044 --> 00:08:42,705
No kid, I'm just a...

27
00:08:43,747 --> 00:08:46,511
I'm just a junkie
and a real good thief.

28
00:08:48,752 --> 00:08:50,686
They kind of go together.

29
00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:52,052
That's it, pal.

30
00:08:53,423 --> 00:08:55,687
Beginning of story.

31
00:08:55,726 --> 00:08:56,852
End of story.

32
00:08:58,762 --> 00:09:00,559
There you go, ba-da-bing!

33
00:09:03,066 --> 00:09:04,465
What I wouldn't give
for veins like that.

34
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:07,061
And don't you ever call me
Melvin again, you little shit.

35
00:09:07,104 --> 00:09:08,594
Thanks, Mel.

36
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:11,631
Hey, you keep a real nice house,
ever hear of a trash can?

37
00:09:14,344 --> 00:09:17,871
Okay so, here is the deal.

38
00:09:17,915 --> 00:09:20,008
What are you doing? Hey.

39
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,678
- Put that down.
- Chill out, man.

40
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:24,584
Chill out? Put it fucking down.

41
00:09:27,891 --> 00:09:29,483
Are you fucking joking?

42
00:09:34,464 --> 00:09:36,955
Bobbie, you look like shit.
The cops are after ya'.

43
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,525
I mean you're hotter than a freshly
fucked fox in a forest fire.

44
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,502
Okay?

45
00:09:40,537 --> 00:09:42,129
Now I iced your nasty
little ass down.

46
00:09:42,172 --> 00:09:44,140
I stopped most of your
internal bleeding.

47
00:09:44,174 --> 00:09:45,641
I put ice packs on your
tiny little head

48
00:09:45,676 --> 00:09:47,303
so maybe the brain damage
won't be too bad.

49
00:09:47,344 --> 00:09:48,834
Gave you my best dope.

50
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,575
And I have spent two fuckin'
days in a shit hole

51
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,106
I would not send my
worst enemy into.

52
00:09:54,151 --> 00:09:55,175
Okay?

53
00:09:55,218 --> 00:09:57,015
Making sure you don't
go into a coma.

54
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,385
So...

55
00:10:00,123 --> 00:10:02,318
Listen to me when I tell you.
If you leave here,

56
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:03,519
they are going to bust you.

57
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,892
And if you shoot any more speed
in the next fucking month,

58
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:07,897
your brain will pop
like a fuckin' balloon.

59
00:10:07,931 --> 00:10:10,456
- I got to go out for speed, man.
- Just listen to me, man.

60
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,434
If you walk out the front door
of this fucking building...

61
00:10:12,469 --> 00:10:14,369
or if you do any more Meth,

62
00:10:14,404 --> 00:10:16,463
I will personally break every
fuckin' bone in your body

63
00:10:16,506 --> 00:10:18,133
that already ain't broken.

64
00:10:18,175 --> 00:10:20,040
And I'll kick the shit out
of Danny for letting you do it.

65
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,341
- Do we understand each other?
- Yikes.

66
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,206
Yes?

67
00:10:27,618 --> 00:10:29,813
We cool? Good.

68
00:10:29,853 --> 00:10:31,115
All right.

69
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,954
So, princess?

70
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:37,893
Can I trust you to keep these
two idiots out of trouble?

71
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,590
- Right on, brother.
- Right on, baby.

72
00:10:41,365 --> 00:10:43,265
Ba-da-bing.

73
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,733
See you later.

74
00:10:46,803 --> 00:10:48,532
Bye, Mel.

75
00:11:57,374 --> 00:11:59,569
I'll fucking kick your ass
you little bitch!

76
00:11:59,609 --> 00:12:02,077
Fucking give me your shit,
you little fucking cunt!

77
00:12:02,112 --> 00:12:04,012
Bobbie, I got to piss.

78
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,011
Bobbie, I got to piss.

79
00:12:13,657 --> 00:12:15,522
Damn, Bobbie.

80
00:12:18,562 --> 00:12:21,190
So how do you like
my ride, Bobbie?

81
00:12:21,231 --> 00:12:23,199
- It's not bad.
- Not bad?

82
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:24,666
I betcha' never even been in
a Cadillac before,

83
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:28,501
let alone the full glory of a top of
the line tricked out Coupe de Ville.

84
00:12:28,538 --> 00:12:30,972
Anybody who says crime don't
pay only knows guys like you.

85
00:12:31,575 --> 00:12:33,406
Fuck you, mother fucker.

86
00:12:33,443 --> 00:12:34,432
I'm not some little kid.

87
00:12:34,478 --> 00:12:37,106
I just made seven-eight hundred
bucks in one night.

88
00:12:37,147 --> 00:12:38,307
Yeah, in fucking quarters.

89
00:12:38,348 --> 00:12:40,179
Probably got a hernia
draggin' them home.

90
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,082
- Shit son.
- Hey, I ain't your son,

91
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:44,451
and I got the fucking quarters home.

92
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:48,380
You damn near got killed
doing it, right?

93
00:12:48,425 --> 00:12:52,521
I got this stealing thing wired.
I don't need shit from you.

94
00:12:53,497 --> 00:12:55,692
- How old are you?
- Old enough.

95
00:12:55,732 --> 00:12:59,725
Why don't you save the tough guy routine
for people you might actually scare.

96
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,102
I'm not fucking putting you down.
I'm trying to make a point.

97
00:13:03,607 --> 00:13:05,666
I don't know how old you are,
but I'm going to bet you money

98
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:07,802
you got a driver's license
that says you're 18 or 19.

99
00:13:07,844 --> 00:13:11,177
And I'll give you 10 to 1
that it's off by 2 or 3 years.

100
00:13:11,214 --> 00:13:12,681
You're doing dope all day.

101
00:13:12,716 --> 00:13:15,116
Every fucking day and you're
stealing with both hands.

102
00:13:15,152 --> 00:13:16,278
Here's my point.

103
00:13:16,319 --> 00:13:17,946
You think you're a thief.

104
00:13:17,988 --> 00:13:20,548
You know what you are?
You're a bust waiting to happen.

105
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:23,354
A pro, okay,

106
00:13:23,393 --> 00:13:25,588
only steals when he knows
everything is in his favor.

107
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:27,688
When he fuckin' knows
he's not going to get caught.

108
00:13:28,498 --> 00:13:31,194
There's only a few true
professionals around,

109
00:13:31,234 --> 00:13:32,326
and guess what?

110
00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:33,461
They don't do dope.

111
00:13:33,503 --> 00:13:35,596
See, eventually the drugs
are going to make you fuck up.

112
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:37,732
And voila, you're in the penitentiary.

113
00:13:39,142 --> 00:13:43,101
The thing is, for guys like us,
you just try to make that run

114
00:13:43,146 --> 00:13:46,377
as good and as long as you can,
before it's over.

115
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,077
Which it will inevitably be.
That's my point.

116
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:54,280
- So, how old are you?
- Old enough.

117
00:13:54,391 --> 00:13:56,552
Fuck, that's right.
Good answer.

118
00:13:56,593 --> 00:13:57,890
Never plead guilty.

119
00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:00,591
Tough guy.

120
00:14:00,997 --> 00:14:02,089
How long have you been on your own?

121
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,793
Forever. What's the difference?

122
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:06,359
I'm just trying to figure things out.
It's how my minds works.

123
00:14:06,403 --> 00:14:08,394
Sue me, fuck, Jesus.

124
00:14:10,006 --> 00:14:12,804
Are you ready to graduate from
screwdrivers and vending machines

125
00:14:12,843 --> 00:14:14,242
to some really serious larceny?

126
00:14:15,345 --> 00:14:18,178
- Like what?
- Like a major score. It's all set up.

127
00:14:18,215 --> 00:14:20,775
Why me?
You must have tons of guys.

128
00:14:20,817 --> 00:14:23,786
I need a guy who's small enough
to get up into a cramped space

129
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,085
and hide there for nine or ten fucking
hours and be fucking cool about it.

130
00:14:27,123 --> 00:14:28,818
Yeah, why not Danny,
he's your blood.

131
00:14:28,859 --> 00:14:31,350
Fair question.
Danny is my sister's kid.

132
00:14:31,394 --> 00:14:33,919
If I got him into the fuckin' life,
she will kill my ass.

133
00:14:33,964 --> 00:14:36,489
Naw man, you got fuckin' smarts.
That's what I like.

134
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:37,932
And you're a tough kid.

135
00:14:37,968 --> 00:14:39,458
Tough. How old are you?

136
00:14:41,605 --> 00:14:44,267
You're already in the life, kiddo.
I hate to say it.

137
00:14:44,307 --> 00:14:47,140
You need someone like
uncle Mel to show you the ropes.

138
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,041
So what do you say?

139
00:14:51,448 --> 00:14:53,075
Tell you what.

140
00:14:53,116 --> 00:14:54,481
This is going to be a couple
of days work,

141
00:14:54,517 --> 00:14:57,884
and your end is going to be
ten grand, minimum.

142
00:15:04,628 --> 00:15:05,959
- Sounds good.
- Deal?

143
00:15:05,996 --> 00:15:09,864
- Sounds real good to me.
- All right. You got it.

144
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,892
- So what do I got to do boss?
- Okay, first thing.

145
00:15:12,936 --> 00:15:15,404
- We leave tomorrow.
- All right, yeah.

146
00:15:15,438 --> 00:15:17,998
We'll be gone a couple,
three weeks maybe.

147
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:21,602
Be fun, all right?
Okay, you got it.

148
00:15:22,846 --> 00:15:24,746
You figure out what you want to do
with your girlfriend, okay?

149
00:15:24,781 --> 00:15:27,545
If you want to bring her along,
that's fine with me.

150
00:15:27,584 --> 00:15:30,052
Oh hey, send Danny down,
I gotta get him home.

151
00:15:30,086 --> 00:15:32,145
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Hey Ace, hey!

152
00:15:32,188 --> 00:15:34,622
Shut the fucking door,
it's hot out there.

153
00:15:34,658 --> 00:15:35,818
Thanks, man.

154
00:16:43,493 --> 00:16:44,960
Maybe he ain't coming.

155
00:16:48,431 --> 00:16:50,558
You know he could be fucking
with you, baby.

156
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,192
Naw baby, Mel is for real.

157
00:16:55,872 --> 00:16:58,602
He is just coming late,
that is all. All right, babe?

158
00:16:58,641 --> 00:17:00,802
All right baby, whatever you say.
You are the boss.

159
00:17:04,781 --> 00:17:06,442
He sure is late.

160
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,950
He is not that late.

161
00:17:09,285 --> 00:17:11,879
All right here he comes.

162
00:17:12,555 --> 00:17:13,749
This better be him.

163
00:17:21,097 --> 00:17:22,496
Hey, how is it going?

164
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:24,630
Hey, Ace.

165
00:17:28,705 --> 00:17:31,538
Jeez-Louise, they are
fucking babies.

166
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,978
Stop it!

167
00:17:36,813 --> 00:17:39,304
You two are Bonnie and Clyde?

168
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,646
So are we.

169
00:17:40,683 --> 00:17:43,243
I love desperados.

170
00:17:43,286 --> 00:17:44,719
I do, don't I?

171
00:17:44,754 --> 00:17:46,346
We are going to have
a really good time.

172
00:17:46,389 --> 00:17:48,220
My name is Sidney.
But you can call me Sid.

173
00:17:48,258 --> 00:17:50,624
- Hi.
- Hi.

174
00:17:51,461 --> 00:17:54,259
Now my dimwitted
friend over here...

175
00:17:54,297 --> 00:17:56,857
has what you call,
poor impulse control.

176
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,630
♪ Aye-yi yi-yi. ♪

177
00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:01,364
♪ Cock-suckers never eat
hair pie. ♪

178
00:18:02,439 --> 00:18:06,603
Now wait a minute, let me guess.
That is your luggage, right?

179
00:18:06,643 --> 00:18:09,669
Which probably means you
have jeans and a tee-shirt?

180
00:18:09,712 --> 00:18:12,442
Which means that we
are going to have to go shopping.

181
00:18:12,482 --> 00:18:14,507
- We dropped the best acid...
- Shut up.

182
00:18:16,186 --> 00:18:18,711
I'm going to take you
guys shopping.

183
00:18:18,755 --> 00:18:19,983
I think you need
a whole new wardrobe.

184
00:18:20,023 --> 00:18:22,787
I need a whole new wardrobe.
That is for sure.

185
00:18:22,826 --> 00:18:24,691
You got a wardrobe
for ten people.

186
00:18:24,727 --> 00:18:27,491
Melvin being the absent minded
professor type that he is,

187
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,464
he also forgot to mention that

188
00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:32,696
you both are absolutely
fucking starving to death.

189
00:18:32,735 --> 00:18:36,364
Jesus Christ you schmuck,
look at them, they are bones.

190
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,237
- Bones...
- Poor babies.

191
00:18:38,274 --> 00:18:40,606
Let's get these guys
something to eat

192
00:18:40,643 --> 00:18:43,043
before they just blow out
the window like fucking leaves.

193
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:45,309
- What do you say?
- Fine.

194
00:18:45,348 --> 00:18:47,612
They do look like death eaten
on a cracker, don't they?

195
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,813
We are going on a road trip
and we will stop to eat.

196
00:18:50,854 --> 00:18:53,414
Because we have road trip boogaloo.

197
00:18:53,456 --> 00:18:57,017
- Boogaloo.
- Road trip boogaloo.

198
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:00,086
♪ Aye-yi yi-yi ♪

199
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:03,327

200
00:19:03,366 --> 00:19:05,231
Drive the car, Melvin.

201
00:19:05,268 --> 00:19:07,065
Did you like this
tongue this morning?

202
00:19:07,103 --> 00:19:09,264
- You guys on acid?
- How long is this tongue?

203
00:19:09,305 --> 00:19:10,829
Is this a long tongue?

204
00:19:10,874 --> 00:19:12,000
How about this one?

205
00:19:15,178 --> 00:19:17,146
Can yours move faster?

206
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,171
- Oh my God.
- Is that moving fast?

207
00:19:19,215 --> 00:19:21,115
Yeah.

208
00:19:21,151 --> 00:19:24,279
- Oh come on, don't be rude.
- Hey look where you are going.

209
00:19:25,388 --> 00:19:28,380
You know, I figure you need
concentration.

210
00:19:28,424 --> 00:19:30,119
You got to be perfect.

211
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,891
You need a nice light touch
for this kind of shit.

212
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:38,424
If that current is broken for
even like one-tenth of a second,

213
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,958
it is all over.

214
00:19:40,003 --> 00:19:41,265
That is why they call them
contact alarms.

215
00:19:41,304 --> 00:19:42,362
See?

216
00:19:43,706 --> 00:19:45,936
That wire is live.

217
00:19:45,975 --> 00:19:47,374
How long do I
got to do this for, man?

218
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,071
All day, all night
if that's what it takes.

219
00:19:49,112 --> 00:19:51,376
Hey, there is no room for error, kid.

220
00:19:51,414 --> 00:19:54,406
You fuck up, the alarm goes off.
Voila, it is over.

221
00:19:57,554 --> 00:19:59,488
- Perfect.
- Hey, Henry Higgins...

222
00:19:59,522 --> 00:20:01,513
how goes the tutoring?

223
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:02,820
Not bad. The kid has talent.

224
00:20:02,859 --> 00:20:04,087
Well you have been working
him for hours.

225
00:20:04,127 --> 00:20:06,789
Why don't you give him a break?
Let's go shopping.

226
00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:08,524
Yeah, maybe it is time
to take a little break.

227
00:20:08,565 --> 00:20:10,829
What do you say?
Lead the way, Miss Doolittle.

228
00:20:13,136 --> 00:20:14,865
Are you going to wear
your crook gloves out?

229
00:20:14,904 --> 00:20:16,235
- No.
- Good.

230
00:20:37,794 --> 00:20:39,819
Hey, not you, princess.
We got work to do.

231
00:20:41,731 --> 00:20:46,259
- I want you back here at 170O.
- We'll be here.

232
00:20:46,302 --> 00:20:48,634
Don't have too much fun, okay?
Kiss?

233
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,437
- Oh, you shocked me.
- I shock you every time.

234
00:20:53,476 --> 00:20:54,943
Come on. Come on.

235
00:20:56,212 --> 00:20:57,338
We're going to take
a little drive.

236
00:21:14,163 --> 00:21:16,859
Fuck, I hate the suburbs.
This is the good shit.

237
00:21:18,935 --> 00:21:20,994
Where are we going, Mel?

238
00:21:21,037 --> 00:21:22,902
I'm taking you for a drive.

239
00:21:22,939 --> 00:21:25,737
- I thought we were working?
- We are working.

240
00:21:25,775 --> 00:21:28,005
You want to sit at the hotel
and play with alarms all afternoon.

241
00:21:28,044 --> 00:21:30,308
Shut up and go for a drive.

242
00:21:32,148 --> 00:21:33,638
Hey!

243
00:21:34,884 --> 00:21:36,476
I would fucking
drink her bath water!

244
00:21:38,288 --> 00:21:39,585
Did you see that ass?

245
00:21:41,858 --> 00:21:43,621
How about Sid, man,
she has got the big titties.

246
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,525
Three things you never fuck with:

247
00:21:45,561 --> 00:21:48,029
You never fuck with
a man's money...

248
00:21:48,064 --> 00:21:50,430
you never fuck with
a man's dope...

249
00:21:50,466 --> 00:21:52,297
and you never fuck with
a man's pussy.

250
00:21:52,335 --> 00:21:53,563
Sorry, man.

251
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:57,539
I never want to get old.

252
00:21:57,573 --> 00:21:59,473
You know what Mel says?

253
00:21:59,509 --> 00:22:01,807
He says that when
he turns sixty...

254
00:22:01,844 --> 00:22:03,471
he is going to drive off a cliff.

255
00:22:05,214 --> 00:22:06,238
You want a fix?

256
00:22:06,282 --> 00:22:08,716
No, I never shoot.
I hate needles.

257
00:22:09,485 --> 00:22:14,047
Well, give it a little time, my dear
and you will come to love needles.

258
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:45,078
So how did you two meet?

259
00:22:45,121 --> 00:22:47,419
Who, me and Mel?

260
00:22:48,191 --> 00:22:49,783
Oh, let's see.

261
00:22:51,227 --> 00:22:55,027
He was selling dope to this
schmuck that I was living with.

262
00:22:55,064 --> 00:22:59,160
And he kept trying to get me to go
out with him behind Charlie's back.

263
00:22:59,202 --> 00:23:02,501
That was the name of the guy, Charlie.

264
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:06,164
- You want one of these?
- No thanks.

265
00:23:06,209 --> 00:23:08,109
I'm addicted to these things.

266
00:23:09,145 --> 00:23:11,978
So anyway, when Charlie
got busted

267
00:23:12,014 --> 00:23:13,811
and I was on my own...

268
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:18,749
I finally said yes to Mel.

269
00:23:18,788 --> 00:23:21,484
And the rest is ancient history.

270
00:23:22,358 --> 00:23:24,383
Are you guys married?

271
00:23:24,427 --> 00:23:27,089
Married, why?

272
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:32,926
Still, it would have been nice
to have a big beautiful wedding.

273
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,904
I guess.

274
00:23:35,938 --> 00:23:38,702
My parents...

275
00:23:38,741 --> 00:23:42,575
I haven't spoken to my parents
since they found out he's Jewish.

276
00:23:49,452 --> 00:23:51,943
It is too bad...

277
00:23:51,988 --> 00:23:55,219
because, he is the ideal man.

278
00:23:55,258 --> 00:23:57,886
I mean, he is smart, he is rich,

279
00:23:57,927 --> 00:23:59,792
he is funny.

280
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:01,023
And he is hung like a horse.

281
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,564
I'm a lucky girl.

282
00:24:12,608 --> 00:24:14,473
You know the best way
to eat pussy?

283
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:17,001
The fucking alphabet.
A, B, C, D.

284
00:24:17,046 --> 00:24:21,005
- No way.
- Try a Z, X, Y, Z.

285
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,887
We're here.

286
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:26,479
- What the fuck is this?
- A clinic.

287
00:24:26,522 --> 00:24:27,580
We are going to rip off
some doctor?

288
00:24:27,623 --> 00:24:28,612
This no regular doctor.

289
00:24:28,658 --> 00:24:30,626
He's the biggest speed doctor
in the mid-west.

290
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,094
- No way.
- Yeah, he's the distributor.

291
00:24:33,129 --> 00:24:35,654
He orders from the manufacture
and he supplies his own clinics.

292
00:24:35,698 --> 00:24:39,327
It goes right through
his pharmacy, right here.

293
00:24:39,368 --> 00:24:42,565
As you can imagine, this guy
does a roaring cash business.

294
00:24:42,605 --> 00:24:44,539
He does a bank drop every morning.

295
00:24:44,574 --> 00:24:45,541
But he is open Saturdays.

296
00:24:45,575 --> 00:24:49,067
So we hit him Saturday night
and we get two day's receipts.

297
00:24:49,111 --> 00:24:50,408
- All right.
- All right.

298
00:24:50,446 --> 00:24:53,813
We will keep some of the
Desoxins and liquid Meth, okay?

299
00:24:54,817 --> 00:24:56,409
Dump the rest wholesale.

300
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,982
You get one third,
expenses come off the top.

301
00:25:00,022 --> 00:25:01,683
Expenses, what expenses?

302
00:25:01,724 --> 00:25:02,520
Living expenses Ace.

303
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:04,492
This is a fucking
business here, okay?

304
00:25:06,863 --> 00:25:09,297
- Holy shit!
- Damn.

305
00:25:09,332 --> 00:25:11,425
I guess you weren't the only
one who went to school today.

306
00:25:11,467 --> 00:25:14,334
Look at you, baby.
You look great.

307
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:16,964
Thank you.

308
00:25:17,707 --> 00:25:19,334
God damn.

309
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:20,569
What is this?

310
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,771
I guess the store is closing
early or something?

311
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:24,404
No, we hardly did any damage.

312
00:25:24,447 --> 00:25:26,608
Besides, we needed something
to wear tonight.

313
00:25:26,649 --> 00:25:28,412
- Tonight?
- What is tonight?

314
00:25:28,451 --> 00:25:31,011
We are going out, baby.
For a big night on the town.

315
00:25:31,053 --> 00:25:33,419
He didn't tell you?
We're going out.

316
00:25:33,456 --> 00:25:36,118
- Mel, what is going on?
- I guess Mel's treating tonight.

317
00:25:38,261 --> 00:25:41,492
- How much did all this cost?
- A lot.

318
00:25:41,531 --> 00:25:43,089
Yeah? How much is a lot?

319
00:25:43,132 --> 00:25:45,327
- Come on, Mel.
- Okay.

320
00:25:45,368 --> 00:25:47,598
- Really, did it cost a lot?
- Goodbye, girls.

321
00:25:55,044 --> 00:25:57,376
Jimmy.

322
00:25:57,413 --> 00:25:59,506
- Hey Mel!
- How you doing?

323
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,980
Long time no see.

324
00:26:08,224 --> 00:26:09,919
Do you think you can get us
a booth tonight?

325
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:26,035
I just got to tell you Rose,
you look really beautiful.

326
00:26:26,075 --> 00:26:28,100
Thank you, Sid.

327
00:26:30,146 --> 00:26:32,205
You are a very lucky guy.

328
00:26:32,248 --> 00:26:34,512
They are both lucky,
lucky they met us.

329
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,916
They got good food,
good booze. Good music.

330
00:26:36,953 --> 00:26:38,318
Now you are living, Ace.

331
00:26:38,354 --> 00:26:40,822
I don't know man,
this place is a little rough.

332
00:26:41,724 --> 00:26:43,453
This fucking place?

333
00:26:43,492 --> 00:26:45,357
Hey, I was in a Blues Bar
in St. Louis.

334
00:26:45,394 --> 00:26:48,625
A guy walks in carrying a severed head.

335
00:26:48,664 --> 00:26:51,895
Walks up, sets it on the bar.
And says, give the bitch a beer.

336
00:26:51,934 --> 00:26:53,925
- That is a true story.
- No way!

337
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:56,063
I'm fucking serious
as a heart attack.

338
00:26:56,105 --> 00:26:58,073
That is a true story.

339
00:26:58,107 --> 00:26:59,904
You live in the fast lane, Mel.

340
00:26:59,942 --> 00:27:01,466
I do.

341
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,842
We're certainly glad to have
everyone here tonight.

342
00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:06,814
Is everyone feeling all right?

343
00:27:06,849 --> 00:27:11,183
Are you all feeling good?
Listen, I'm telling you true.

344
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:14,587
I got to have somebody
to scratch my back tonight.

345
00:27:16,225 --> 00:27:18,352
If you want to hear
Clarence Carter scream,

346
00:27:18,394 --> 00:27:21,022
you just have somebody
scratch my back.

347
00:27:21,063 --> 00:27:23,531
In fact, what I think I'll do
is play a little song,

348
00:27:23,566 --> 00:27:25,090
so you'll understand what I'm
talking about.

349
00:27:25,134 --> 00:27:27,830
A little song called,
"I'm Looking for a Fox."

350
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:30,430
It goes something like this.

351
00:27:30,473 --> 00:27:32,668
- Dance? No way.

I don't want you puking
on my new suit.

382
00:29:55,684 --> 00:29:56,878
Come on.

383
00:29:58,287 --> 00:29:59,777
- I love you, Mel.
- Yeah?

384
00:30:01,457 --> 00:30:02,981
You saved my life.

385
00:30:03,025 --> 00:30:05,858
I sure did kid, but let's just
stay focused on not puking.

386
00:30:05,895 --> 00:30:09,626
I'm the happiest now then
I have ever been in my whole life.

387
00:30:09,665 --> 00:30:12,259
Before tonight, I never even
drank champagne before.

388
00:30:12,301 --> 00:30:13,268
You don't say?

389
00:30:13,302 --> 00:30:16,271
You might have mentioned that
a little earlier in the evening.

390
00:30:16,305 --> 00:30:18,330
Oh, yeah?

391
00:30:21,811 --> 00:30:24,803
Okay, five feet to heaven.

392
00:30:27,416 --> 00:30:28,713
Here we go.

393
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:31,919
Sorry. Sorry.

394
00:30:32,688 --> 00:30:33,950
Here, you want
to take your shoes off?

395
00:30:35,257 --> 00:30:36,622
Guess not. Fine.

396
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:38,024
There you go.

397
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,392
You feeling okay?
You are not sick are you?

398
00:30:41,497 --> 00:30:44,466
You are in bed, good night.
Night, night.

399
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,292
Thanks, Mel.

400
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:25,690
He could have fit up here.

401
00:32:32,841 --> 00:32:34,502
Fuck.

402
00:32:37,546 --> 00:32:39,377
Bingo.

403
00:32:54,964 --> 00:32:56,898
Easy as fucking cake.

404
00:33:17,386 --> 00:33:19,217
Did I scare you, baby?

405
00:33:19,254 --> 00:33:21,017
Lead the way, boss.

406
00:33:21,056 --> 00:33:23,547
We're rich!
We are so fucking rich!

407
00:33:23,592 --> 00:33:25,025
Still got to sell this shit, Ace.

408
00:33:47,983 --> 00:33:49,814
Knock, knock.

409
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:56,821
Bobby, this is Reverend James Cook.

410
00:33:56,859 --> 00:34:02,024
Today, I can offer you
the worldly protection...

411
00:34:02,064 --> 00:34:05,124
of the weapons of the hand.

412
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:07,825
You are a gun dealer?

413
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:10,839
I'm a gunsmith by trade.

414
00:34:10,873 --> 00:34:14,570
But a fisher of men
by avocation.

415
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,475
But you are a preacher.
Doesn't that go against your morals?

416
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:19,845
Even Jesus Christ was a carpenter.

417
00:34:19,882 --> 00:34:21,110
And his disciples, fisherman.

418
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:24,278
And we know blessed
Mary Magdalene was a whore.

419
00:34:24,319 --> 00:34:26,480
Boys, I hate to break up the
theological discussion here...

420
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:27,386
but how much for the lot, Jim?

421
00:34:27,423 --> 00:34:28,947
Two thousand total.

422
00:34:28,991 --> 00:34:31,721
I prefer 10O's.

423
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,125
And now...

424
00:34:34,329 --> 00:34:36,422
May God bless you...

425
00:34:36,465 --> 00:34:39,593
and keep you safe
under his protection...

426
00:34:39,635 --> 00:34:41,330

Somebody you never want
to mess with.

434
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:29,414
Got you first.

435
00:35:47,536 --> 00:35:48,833
Hey baby.

436
00:35:48,871 --> 00:35:52,170
Kind of pretty
for something so ugly?

437
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,644
I'm pregnant, Bobby,
what do you think about that?

438
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,945
I have been trying to tell
you for awhile you know,

439
00:36:06,989 --> 00:36:09,253
but I didn't know how to say it.

440
00:36:13,228 --> 00:36:15,594
Come on baby, don't just stand
there all peeing and shit.

441
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:16,290
Say something.

442
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:19,759
This is serious.

443
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,297
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know.

444
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,633
What if I want to keep it?

445
00:36:25,674 --> 00:36:29,872
Shit baby, you think that
is a good idea?

446
00:36:29,912 --> 00:36:33,814
I mean, fuck,
I ain't old enough to handle kids.

447
00:36:33,849 --> 00:36:36,841
Oh I see, you are just a kid, right?

448
00:36:36,885 --> 00:36:39,115
One minute you are
Mister Big Man with Mel...

449
00:36:39,154 --> 00:36:41,088
and the next minute you're
just a helpless little boy.

450
00:36:41,123 --> 00:36:42,420
- Is that it?
- No, that is not what I meant.

451
00:36:42,457 --> 00:36:44,288
I'm just saying maybe we should wait...

452
00:36:44,326 --> 00:36:47,056
wait until all this
shit is over, you know?

453
00:36:47,062 --> 00:36:49,292
Wait til it is
a good time to have kids.

454
00:36:49,331 --> 00:36:52,494
There never will be a good time,
there will always be something wrong.

455
00:36:53,902 --> 00:36:56,803
If I keep it, are you going to leave?

456
00:36:56,838 --> 00:36:58,305
I don't know baby...

457
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,308
I never even thought about
having kids before.

458
00:37:00,342 --> 00:37:02,105
Seeing how my parents
fucked me up and all.

459
00:37:02,144 --> 00:37:04,476
Yeah well, our parents didn't
give a fucking shit about us.

460
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:07,073
So fuck them!
But we can do better.

461
00:37:07,115 --> 00:37:09,549
We can be the kind of
parents that they never were.

462
00:37:14,423 --> 00:37:16,550
You are the best thing
that ever happened to me, baby.

463
00:37:20,295 --> 00:37:21,762
I love you.

464
00:37:23,932 --> 00:37:26,594
But I'll do this alone
if I have to.

465
00:37:26,635 --> 00:37:30,594
Shit baby, you know me
better than that.

466
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:33,472
The only way you are going to
get rid of me is if I die.

467
00:37:33,508 --> 00:37:35,533
And I am not going to fucking die, okay?

468
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,174
Oh good.

469
00:37:40,249 --> 00:37:42,911
Besides I'll spoil the shit
out of him, right?

470
00:37:42,951 --> 00:37:44,111
Or her.

471
00:37:44,152 --> 00:37:47,087
- Hey have you told Sid yet?
- No.

472
00:37:47,122 --> 00:37:49,147
Oh my God!

473
00:37:49,191 --> 00:37:51,921
Oh my God. You're pregnant.

474
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,724
Oh my God. Oh my God.

475
00:37:54,763 --> 00:37:56,628
They are pregnant.
You're pregnant.

476
00:37:56,665 --> 00:37:59,429
You are going to have a baby.
You're going to have a little baby.

477
00:37:59,468 --> 00:38:01,459
A beautiful little baby.

478
00:38:02,638 --> 00:38:05,937
Oh my God, I can't fucking
believe it!

479
00:38:05,974 --> 00:38:08,238
All right. Calm down.

480
00:38:08,277 --> 00:38:09,471
Great news.

481
00:38:09,511 --> 00:38:11,069
But, everybody in the world
doesn't have to hear it.

482
00:38:11,113 --> 00:38:13,513
What do you mean, everybody
doesn't need to know.

483
00:38:13,548 --> 00:38:15,243
What, am I being loud,
is that what you mean?

484
00:38:16,885 --> 00:38:18,853
I mean, who gives a flying fuck really?

485
00:38:18,887 --> 00:38:21,412
It is so cool,
I can't believe it.

486
00:38:21,456 --> 00:38:23,481
A baby, now wait a minute,
how pregnant are you?

487
00:38:23,525 --> 00:38:25,459
When are you
going to have this baby?

488
00:38:25,494 --> 00:38:26,586
What do you want?

489
00:38:26,628 --> 00:38:28,493
- A girl.
- A boy.

490
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:32,489
Your eyes, and your mouth.
Oh my God.

491
00:38:32,534 --> 00:38:34,695
Little babies,
I love little babies.

492
00:38:34,736 --> 00:38:36,363
No more caffeine for you, missy.

493
00:38:36,405 --> 00:38:38,464
For me? It is for her.

494
00:38:39,908 --> 00:38:42,274
I think you are a bit more
excited about this than we are.

495
00:38:42,311 --> 00:38:43,437
You think? No...

496
00:38:43,478 --> 00:38:45,105
well you will get more excited.

497
00:38:45,147 --> 00:38:47,479
No, we are excited.

498
00:38:47,516 --> 00:38:49,108
Oh, I love kids.

499
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,155
What the fuck are you doing?

500
00:38:57,492 --> 00:38:58,982
What am I doing?

501
00:39:02,297 --> 00:39:03,730
Yeah, what are you doing?

502
00:39:03,765 --> 00:39:05,460
I'm not doing anything.

503
00:39:06,268 --> 00:39:07,428
What is your fucking problem?

504
00:39:10,038 --> 00:39:12,370
Don't... do this.

505
00:39:27,289 --> 00:39:29,519
Fuck you, Mel.

506
00:39:42,437 --> 00:39:44,837
So there are some details
I want to go over at the motel,

507
00:39:44,873 --> 00:39:46,568
before the clients start coming, okay?

508
00:39:46,608 --> 00:39:48,633
Whatever you say man,
you are the boss.

509
00:39:50,412 --> 00:39:53,643
Should you be smoking?
The baby?

510
00:39:59,287 --> 00:40:02,586
- So which one do you like?
- Well, the.38 Smith and Wesson.

511
00:40:02,624 --> 00:40:04,524
It is a Chief's Special.
It is compact,

512
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:07,027
plenty of stopping power
with these hollow points.

513
00:40:07,062 --> 00:40:08,620
I got it all sighted in
on the range.

514
00:40:08,663 --> 00:40:10,563
Accurate to fifty feet.

515
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:12,658
Oh gosh, that's nice.

516
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:14,726
Pay attention, G.I. Joe.

517
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:16,928
If you want to learn,
you got to listen.

518
00:40:16,972 --> 00:40:19,634
- I'm listening.
- Put the gun down and watch.

519
00:40:19,674 --> 00:40:20,663
I'm listening.

520
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:23,507
Put the fucking gun down before
I smack the shit out of you.

521
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,711
Come here.

522
00:40:27,783 --> 00:40:29,944
A Walther PP.
I call it a lucky seven,

523
00:40:29,985 --> 00:40:33,182
because it has got
six in the clip and...

524
00:40:33,221 --> 00:40:34,313
one in the chamber.

525
00:40:34,356 --> 00:40:35,618
Let me see your hands.

526
00:40:35,657 --> 00:40:37,386
See you got delicate hands
and not a lot of muscle.

527
00:40:37,426 --> 00:40:39,826
- Fuck you.
- No man. This is good for you.

528
00:40:39,861 --> 00:40:41,453
It has good balance.
How does it feel?

529
00:40:41,496 --> 00:40:42,986
- Oh, it feels good.
- Yeah?

530
00:40:43,031 --> 00:40:44,760
- I like it.
- Good?

531
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,563
See, Sid and me will
teach you how to shoot.

532
00:40:46,601 --> 00:40:48,000
Now here's the deal.

533
00:40:48,036 --> 00:40:50,596
You make a gun feel like it's
an extension of your arm.

534
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:53,130
And after a little practice
you don't have to aim.

535
00:40:53,175 --> 00:40:55,439
You just point your hand at
what you want to hit and boom.

536
00:40:55,477 --> 00:40:57,035
It will fucking
have holes in it all day.

537
00:40:58,613 --> 00:41:01,309
I'd like to see some fucker
try some shit on me with this.

538
00:41:01,349 --> 00:41:02,976
Finish his ass like Swiss cheese.

539
00:41:05,053 --> 00:41:07,180
Hey, something you got to
understand Ace, all right?

540
00:41:07,222 --> 00:41:09,520
A gun is there for your protection.

541
00:41:09,558 --> 00:41:11,287
You use it when
you have no other option.

542
00:41:11,326 --> 00:41:13,055
It ain't your fucking dick
so don't be whipping it out

543
00:41:13,094 --> 00:41:15,028
every time you want to prove
you are a fucking tough guy.

544
00:41:15,063 --> 00:41:16,997
Okay? You got that?

545
00:41:17,032 --> 00:41:18,795
Yeah man, I ain't stupid.

546
00:41:21,269 --> 00:41:22,236
Glad to hear it.

547
00:41:26,107 --> 00:41:26,971
Thanks.

548
00:41:29,911 --> 00:41:33,347
Hey, Mel. What you think about
me being a dad?

549
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,342
Pretty crazy?

550
00:41:37,385 --> 00:41:39,250
I think you are pretty young
to be popping out babies.

551
00:41:39,287 --> 00:41:41,721
But hey, it ain't my business.

552
00:41:41,756 --> 00:41:44,782
Rosie is really excited,
but I'm nervous.

553
00:41:44,826 --> 00:41:47,056
I guess that is normal?

554
00:41:47,095 --> 00:41:49,256
Me and Sid can't do it.
Can't have no babies.

555
00:41:49,297 --> 00:41:51,322
So do me a favor
and go light on the topic.

556
00:41:54,436 --> 00:41:56,165
Fuck it.

557
00:41:56,204 --> 00:41:58,764
Just the luck of the draw.

558
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:07,748
You and Sid have really been
like parents to me and Rosie.

559
00:42:10,785 --> 00:42:12,844
So I kind of guess you
got kids after all.

560
00:42:12,888 --> 00:42:15,186
Even if it is not the way
you expect, right?

561
00:42:15,223 --> 00:42:17,088
Give me a break, kid.

562
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:18,057
You think
if I was going to adopt,

563
00:42:18,093 --> 00:42:20,823
I would end up with
a delinquent doper like you?

564
00:42:23,198 --> 00:42:24,426
I don't think so.

565
00:42:32,474 --> 00:42:35,068
I'm just fucking with you.
Don't be so sensitive.

566
00:42:38,146 --> 00:42:39,443
Don't worry, Bobbie.

567
00:42:40,549 --> 00:42:41,811
Everything's going to work out.

568
00:42:43,618 --> 00:42:45,950
You think so?

569
00:42:45,987 --> 00:42:47,113
Yeah, I do.

570
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,587
Yeah?

571
00:42:54,629 --> 00:42:55,527
Send him over.

572
00:42:56,464 --> 00:42:57,988
First clients have arrived.

573
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:02,234
So what will I do?

574
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:03,498
Just hang there, look cool.

575
00:43:09,377 --> 00:43:11,937
How about fifty cents each?

576
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,174
No way pal, no.

577
00:43:13,214 --> 00:43:15,774
Sixty cents, that is it.
Or we don't do business.

578
00:43:15,817 --> 00:43:19,150
Black Beauties are selling for two,
three dollars a piece on the street.

579
00:43:19,187 --> 00:43:23,089
Twenty-five hundred dollars.
Cash money, right now.

580
00:43:23,124 --> 00:43:25,854
Or we walk... fucker.

581
00:43:30,131 --> 00:43:33,828
We'll find a better price.
It is just as simple as that.

582
00:43:33,868 --> 00:43:36,598
Sixty cents, or we don't have a deal.

583
00:43:36,638 --> 00:43:38,299
It is as simple as that.

584
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:39,602
Fucker!

585
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,546
Who has the money?

586
00:43:48,316 --> 00:43:48,975
Take it out.

587
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,718
Let me see it. Let me see it.

588
00:43:54,756 --> 00:43:56,314
Put it on the bed.

589
00:43:56,358 --> 00:43:58,155
My partner's going to count it.

590
00:43:58,193 --> 00:44:00,684
If it's all there,
you get your Black Beauties.

591
00:44:00,729 --> 00:44:02,321
You hit the road
and everything is cool.

592
00:44:02,364 --> 00:44:03,456
If it comes up short...

593
00:44:03,498 --> 00:44:04,795
I'm just going to take
all your fucking money.

594
00:44:04,833 --> 00:44:06,926
And you can suck my dick.

595
00:44:06,968 --> 00:44:09,198
Okay...

596
00:44:09,237 --> 00:44:10,226
fucker?

597
00:44:15,143 --> 00:44:17,634
No. It is all here, three G's.

598
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:18,737
Perfect.

599
00:44:21,316 --> 00:44:22,283
Watch this.

600
00:44:26,187 --> 00:44:27,916
Five thousand Biphetamines.

601
00:44:29,524 --> 00:44:30,957
It is as simple as that.

602
00:44:32,427 --> 00:44:33,325
Ha!

603
00:44:34,929 --> 00:44:36,226
Just fucking with you fellas.

604
00:44:38,867 --> 00:44:40,960
What, are you from California
of something?

605
00:44:41,002 --> 00:44:44,130
Like a surfer?
Like a Big Kahuna?

606
00:44:44,172 --> 00:44:45,230
Yeah.

607
00:44:45,273 --> 00:44:46,399
You in a band or something?

608
00:44:53,014 --> 00:44:54,003
What?

609
00:44:55,016 --> 00:44:56,449
Don't worry boys, it's all there.

610
00:44:56,484 --> 00:44:58,281
Your mommy's and daddy's
money is well spent.

611
00:44:58,319 --> 00:44:59,251
Go on beat it.

612
00:44:59,287 --> 00:45:01,414
Kahuna hit the
fucking big waves, baby.

613
00:45:01,456 --> 00:45:02,582
Bye.

614
00:45:03,458 --> 00:45:05,483
- Fucker.
- Who do you think you are?

615
00:45:05,527 --> 00:45:07,893
- Fast Draw McGraw?
- What, what did I do?

616
00:45:07,929 --> 00:45:09,556
Hey, the fucking guy
was trying to set the price.

617
00:45:09,597 --> 00:45:12,395
That is my job.
Okay, that's my fuckin' gig.

618
00:45:12,434 --> 00:45:14,834
And he looked pretty mean,
that guy. Barry?

619
00:45:14,869 --> 00:45:16,598
He was like a mean looking guy,
wasn't he?

620
00:45:16,638 --> 00:45:18,128
- I was scared.
- Scared shitless.

621
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,731
Fuck, I was shivering,
quaking in my boots.

622
00:45:19,774 --> 00:45:21,639
Oh my God, did you see his shirt?

623
00:45:21,676 --> 00:45:23,405
- Oh my God.
- Oh baby.

624
00:45:23,445 --> 00:45:26,039
You know, you are a forty-year-old
who acts like a kid.

625
00:45:26,081 --> 00:45:29,539
And you are a kid, shit,
who acts like a forty-year-old.

626
00:45:29,584 --> 00:45:32,951
Hey, you know what I am,
I'm a fucking forty-year-old.

627
00:45:32,987 --> 00:45:35,080
- Yeah, I know.
- Okay, so I act like a kid.

628
00:45:35,123 --> 00:45:38,684
But I fuck like a kid too,
okay, baby?

629
00:45:38,727 --> 00:45:40,319
Yeah, that is true.

630
00:45:40,361 --> 00:45:42,659
I'm a kid who fucks like
a forty-year-old.

631
00:45:42,697 --> 00:45:45,427
- Sid, come on back, Sid.
- Sid, thanks for sharing all that.

632
00:45:45,467 --> 00:45:47,901
- Yeah, thanks.
- Thanks for over-sharing.

633
00:45:47,936 --> 00:45:49,494
- I think she likes me?
- No.

634
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:00,071
Hey, why can't you fucking shoot
it like everybody else?

635
00:46:00,115 --> 00:46:03,050
You know your needle-phobia
is wasting a lot of my good smack.

636
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:09,882
What is your problem, man?

637
00:46:09,924 --> 00:46:12,916
We got so much shit
we are giving it away.

638
00:46:14,763 --> 00:46:17,254
Oh I guess I'm just a little
tense about our next deal.

639
00:46:17,298 --> 00:46:19,823
The fucking guys call
themselves Hitler's Henchmen.

640
00:46:19,868 --> 00:46:22,166
They are like a bike gang
that don't require bikes.

641
00:46:22,203 --> 00:46:23,898
Go figure.

642
00:46:27,509 --> 00:46:29,977
Sid don't want to have
anything to do with 'em.

643
00:46:30,011 --> 00:46:31,239
But man, they want
so much fucking volume.

644
00:46:31,279 --> 00:46:33,247
I don't give a shit what
they call themselves, man.

645
00:46:33,281 --> 00:46:34,646
As long as they got a lot of dough.

646
00:46:35,383 --> 00:46:37,044
Sid doesn't like 'em?

647
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:40,612
Oh, she has been on my ass
about it all fucking day.

648
00:46:40,655 --> 00:46:42,247
Yack, yack, yack, yack, yack.

649
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:43,655
It is like, fuck it. You know?

650
00:46:43,691 --> 00:46:46,125
I mean I'm the one
who lost relatives in the war.

651
00:46:46,161 --> 00:46:47,287
Don't bother me none.

652
00:46:51,566 --> 00:46:53,659
Grudge shopping?

653
00:46:53,701 --> 00:46:54,861
Whatever.

654
00:46:57,972 --> 00:46:58,768
Mel?

655
00:47:01,042 --> 00:47:02,407
What!

656
00:47:02,443 --> 00:47:04,570
I don't want to get near
these cock-suckers.

657
00:47:04,612 --> 00:47:06,011
Fine, okay.

658
00:47:06,047 --> 00:47:08,277
So who's going to bring the
shit over when we make the deal?

659
00:47:08,316 --> 00:47:10,307
I will.
I'll bring the shit over.

660
00:47:10,351 --> 00:47:11,978
Great. Okay.

661
00:47:13,521 --> 00:47:16,012
- Let me know when it arrives.
- Yeah, fine.

662
00:47:16,057 --> 00:47:17,456
- Wait.
- What?

663
00:47:17,492 --> 00:47:18,857
Give me that. Thank you.

664
00:47:23,264 --> 00:47:24,925
What the fuck, man!

665
00:47:26,434 --> 00:47:27,992
Are they on the rag or what?

666
00:47:28,036 --> 00:47:29,833
Not my girl.

667
00:47:29,871 --> 00:47:31,065
Well mine is on the rag
or both of them.

668
00:47:32,774 --> 00:47:35,038
Look at this.

669
00:47:35,076 --> 00:47:37,442
- That was pathetic.
- Where is the rest of our shit?

670
00:47:37,478 --> 00:47:40,914
- Rosie took it over.
- So I have nothing?

671
00:47:40,949 --> 00:47:42,974
Great.
Everybody is fucking high but me.

672
00:48:22,523 --> 00:48:24,354
You know we do our own cookin'.

673
00:48:25,627 --> 00:48:28,721
Make crystal so good
it looks like glass.

674
00:48:28,763 --> 00:48:31,288
- Ain't that right, Ty?
- Yeah, we do.

675
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,163
So if your crank is so good,
how come you want these ups?

676
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:37,330
Well not everybody likes crank, pal.

677
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:39,101
Some people like pills.

678
00:48:40,308 --> 00:48:41,935
After we get done selling these ups,

679
00:48:41,976 --> 00:48:45,309
twenty-five G's turns into a hundred.

680
00:48:45,847 --> 00:48:48,008
That's why "big-time."

681
00:48:50,985 --> 00:48:53,852
Make the call.
Fifty thousand beans.

682
00:48:54,889 --> 00:48:56,220
All right then.

683
00:48:57,191 --> 00:48:59,216
Say, have you ever heard this one?

684
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:01,626
If the "Flintstones" was black,

685
00:49:01,663 --> 00:49:03,893
what would they call the show?

686
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,659
"The Niggers."

687
00:49:10,772 --> 00:49:12,831
What, you don't think that's funny?

688
00:49:14,075 --> 00:49:14,973
Hey, I got one...

689
00:49:21,282 --> 00:49:24,615
How do you circumcise a redneck?

690
00:49:24,652 --> 00:49:26,347
I don't know.

691
00:49:26,387 --> 00:49:28,855
Kick his sister in the chin.

692
00:49:40,501 --> 00:49:42,935
What the fuck!

693
00:49:43,571 --> 00:49:44,765
You see?

694
00:49:44,806 --> 00:49:46,637
You can't never be too cautious.

695
00:49:51,946 --> 00:49:52,503
Fuck!

696
00:49:57,352 --> 00:50:00,719
Spinner here came up from nextdoor.
The rest of the stash...

697
00:50:00,755 --> 00:50:03,019
probably there with the Jew-boy's
bitch guarding it!

698
00:50:03,057 --> 00:50:03,751
Hey! Hey! Hey!

699
00:50:03,791 --> 00:50:05,122
Ty and me will stay here.

700
00:50:05,159 --> 00:50:07,184
You two go get the cunt
and our stash!

701
00:50:07,228 --> 00:50:08,593
Listen boss, you got
the best hand!

702
00:50:08,629 --> 00:50:09,755
Why don't you just let
the chicks go?

703
00:50:09,797 --> 00:50:11,788
Let me just get
the kid to the hospital.

704
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:12,765
I got fifty G's stashed.

705
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:18,568
Melvin, do you know how you get a
hundred Jews into a Mercedes Benz?

706
00:50:20,675 --> 00:50:23,439
In the ashtray.

707
00:50:32,387 --> 00:50:34,446
How do you like me now,
mother fucker?

708
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:43,088
Jew-boy's bitch?

709
00:50:44,132 --> 00:50:46,464
Melvin!

710
00:50:56,677 --> 00:50:58,338
Shit!

711
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:00,407
Fuck! Are they dead?

712
00:51:00,448 --> 00:51:02,609
- No?
- Yes, no?

713
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:04,811
Are you all right?
Are you all right, Bobbie?

714
00:51:04,852 --> 00:51:06,513
Get up, get up. Shit!

715
00:51:06,554 --> 00:51:08,146
We have to get you
to a hospital.

716
00:51:08,189 --> 00:51:10,987
Bobbie, get the dope.

717
00:51:11,025 --> 00:51:12,856
Go get the car.
Get the car, Rosie! Now!

718
00:51:14,429 --> 00:51:16,761
- Get the money!
- No, get the dope!

719
00:51:16,798 --> 00:51:18,823
- Get the fucking money!
- All right, get the money!

720
00:51:18,866 --> 00:51:20,663
Come on,
we have to get out of here.

721
00:51:22,603 --> 00:51:23,831
No Mel, he will get the money, honey.

722
00:51:23,871 --> 00:51:27,500
Come on, get up.
Mel, let him get the money and get up!

723
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:29,271
Bobbie, you okay man,
you fucked up?

724
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:31,801
Come on I can't pick you up, help me!

725
00:51:31,846 --> 00:51:33,404
Okay, okay, okay.

726
00:51:40,054 --> 00:51:41,544
I can't hold you,
come on, stand up.

727
00:51:46,427 --> 00:51:48,122
Damn it!

728
00:52:04,178 --> 00:52:06,169
Bobbie, are you hit?

729
00:52:06,647 --> 00:52:07,443
Are you hit?

730
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:16,113
- Oh shit!
- We're going to the hospital.

731
00:52:16,157 --> 00:52:18,887
- No we are not!
- We got to get you to a doctor!

732
00:52:18,926 --> 00:52:20,553
And the kid needs a real doctor!

733
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:22,563
If we go anywhere near
a hospital in the five-state area,

734
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:23,894
we're fucking busted!

735
00:52:23,931 --> 00:52:25,831
The reverend's the only
chance we got!

736
00:52:25,867 --> 00:52:27,425
He has a whole crew working.

737
00:52:27,468 --> 00:52:30,995
So we go to Jim-Bo's
which is only three hours away.

738
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:35,906
Oh God.

739
00:52:38,846 --> 00:52:39,710
Fuck it!

740
00:52:41,516 --> 00:52:43,211
I should have gone to Veterinary School.

741
00:52:43,251 --> 00:52:46,482
I was going to be
a fucking vet, you know that?

742
00:52:46,521 --> 00:52:48,682
- I was going to be a vet.
- Who the fuck cares man!

743
00:52:48,723 --> 00:52:49,712
I thought it was bullshit,

744
00:52:49,757 --> 00:52:52,157
sticking my fucking finger
up a poodle's ass!

745
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:57,761
You are really sick.

746
00:52:59,901 --> 00:53:01,391
Oh fuck me.

747
00:53:03,237 --> 00:53:06,331
I think I'm fucked up.
I'm fucked up.

748
00:53:06,374 --> 00:53:09,343
It was a funny joke about
the "Flintstones."

749
00:53:10,678 --> 00:53:14,409
How can you laugh like that?
Doesn't it hurt?

750
00:53:14,448 --> 00:53:17,645
Yeah, it fucking hurts,
but only when I laugh.

751
00:53:20,755 --> 00:53:23,519
Oh my God.

752
00:53:55,122 --> 00:53:57,886
We need to see the reverend.

753
00:54:03,197 --> 00:54:04,596
Go on down to the house.

754
00:54:55,783 --> 00:54:57,876
Careful.

755
00:54:57,918 --> 00:55:00,546
You are home now, boy.
Ain't nobody going to hurt you.

756
00:55:36,023 --> 00:55:40,119
Don't be moving around.
You have to lay still.

757
00:55:46,334 --> 00:55:48,768
You were mighty bad
when you came in,

758
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:52,170
but you are improving by the minute.
Only kidding.

759
00:55:52,206 --> 00:55:55,300
He has helped a lot of folks.

760
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:05,451
Oh slow it down there, boy.

761
00:56:10,324 --> 00:56:12,121
Hey there.

762
00:56:12,159 --> 00:56:15,390
I kind of like you this way... crazy.

763
00:56:15,429 --> 00:56:17,795
You know they got goats here.

764
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:20,426
Cows, chickens, rabbits.

765
00:56:26,107 --> 00:56:28,701
I lost it.

766
00:56:28,743 --> 00:56:32,543
Buy hey, don't worry
about me, I'm cool.

767
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:35,640
What would we do
with a baby anyway?

768
00:56:36,751 --> 00:56:39,879
Don't think, okay? Just rest.

769
00:56:40,988 --> 00:56:44,151
I'll come back later
and give you a blow-job.

770
00:56:44,191 --> 00:56:45,681
Yikes.

771
00:56:49,029 --> 00:56:52,226
- Do it again?
- Yeah.

772
00:57:05,212 --> 00:57:07,203
Oh that is good.

773
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,092
Look, I got hair on my toes.

774
00:57:22,129 --> 00:57:23,892
When did I get that?

775
00:57:23,931 --> 00:57:25,455
I didn't have that before
I met you guys.

776
00:57:28,235 --> 00:57:31,898
- You need a pedicure.
- You want to give me a pedicure?

777
00:57:37,378 --> 00:57:39,243
Sure I'll give you a pedicure.

778
00:57:47,254 --> 00:57:49,381
I have to try this.

779
00:57:53,093 --> 00:57:54,993
- Want a drag?
- No thanks.

780
00:57:59,567 --> 00:58:03,731
So what you doing with this
Mel fool anyway?

781
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:06,239
- With this Mel fool?
- Yeah.

782
00:58:08,342 --> 00:58:10,139
Oh man, I can't wait
to get out of here.

783
00:58:11,245 --> 00:58:13,509
Fucking middle of nowhere.

784
00:58:15,883 --> 00:58:17,145
All this...

785
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,785
Space!

786
00:58:21,822 --> 00:58:24,313
Makes me nervous, man.

787
00:58:24,358 --> 00:58:28,226
Give me, high rises,
traffic, smog.

788
00:58:28,262 --> 00:58:30,958
Fucking anything but all this
God damn...

789
00:58:30,998 --> 00:58:34,297
nowhere, nothing, shit!

790
00:58:34,335 --> 00:58:36,235
I hear you, man.

791
00:58:38,772 --> 00:58:41,400
- I got this friend, Jewels.
- Yeah?

792
00:58:41,442 --> 00:58:44,707
He has some vault thing going.

793
00:58:44,745 --> 00:58:46,508
It sounds pretty good.

794
00:58:46,547 --> 00:58:48,412
What do you mean?

795
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:51,008
I mean we got a job.
We are out of here tomorrow.

796
00:58:58,225 --> 00:59:00,056
What?

797
00:59:00,094 --> 00:59:02,460
I just thought, you know,
we were going to lay low.

798
00:59:02,496 --> 00:59:03,554
- Take it easy.
- Take it easy?

799
00:59:03,597 --> 00:59:05,258
What are you, some kind
of fucking old man now?

800
00:59:05,299 --> 00:59:08,826
Naw. Just thought we were going
to play it cool, that is all.

801
00:59:08,869 --> 00:59:10,359
You know, relax.

802
00:59:10,404 --> 00:59:11,962
Well...

803
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,200
I changed my mind.

804
00:59:17,278 --> 00:59:20,770
- It is a lot of money, Bobbie.
- We got money.

805
00:59:20,814 --> 00:59:22,475
We got half our money.

806
00:59:22,516 --> 00:59:24,575
Those ups we got left aren't
worth shit now.

807
00:59:24,618 --> 00:59:26,848
How about the cops?
Aren't they looking for us?

808
00:59:28,255 --> 00:59:30,348
You let me worry about that, all right?

809
00:59:30,391 --> 00:59:31,483
- Shit, Mel.
- What is the deal?

810
00:59:31,525 --> 00:59:33,891
Why you sweating this so much?

811
00:59:33,928 --> 00:59:36,522
I'm not sweating anything, Mel.
I'm just, fuck!

812
00:59:36,564 --> 00:59:39,192
Rosie lost the baby!
You fucking almost got killed.

813
00:59:39,233 --> 00:59:40,825
Hey, it's part of the territory.

814
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:44,304
If you don't like the risk
maybe you should change professions.

815
00:59:44,338 --> 00:59:46,169
Busboy.

816
00:59:48,342 --> 00:59:50,207
Milkman...

817
00:59:50,244 --> 00:59:51,438
Bum.

818
00:59:51,478 --> 00:59:54,504
Jesus! Fuck man!
See, you just don't get it.

819
00:59:54,548 --> 00:59:56,914
You fucking don't get it,
you little shit!

820
00:59:56,951 --> 01:00:00,182
This is about money! Money!

821
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:04,081
We hit this, we are set for life.

822
01:00:04,124 --> 01:00:07,184
You and that little twat will
have it made in the shade.

823
01:00:07,227 --> 01:00:09,320
And you ain't even twenty yet.
Think about that.

824
01:00:09,363 --> 01:00:10,762
Think about it!

825
01:00:12,199 --> 01:00:13,427
I don't know about you...

826
01:00:13,467 --> 01:00:16,129
but I ain't quitting until
I get what I came for.

827
01:00:16,170 --> 01:00:18,297
Understand me? Anything else...

828
01:00:18,339 --> 01:00:20,637
Listen to me!
Anything else is a compromise.

829
01:00:20,674 --> 01:00:23,074
And compromise is for losers.

830
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:25,442
Fucking, fucking, nobodies!

831
01:00:30,484 --> 01:00:32,816
Don't tell me I don't get it.

832
01:00:55,643 --> 01:00:58,407
It's the booze talking, son.

833
01:00:59,413 --> 01:01:01,404
It's the fucking booze.

834
01:01:04,251 --> 01:01:07,550
This is something I need you on.
It is about trust, okay?

835
01:01:07,588 --> 01:01:09,920
I haven't steered
you wrong yet, have I?

836
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:14,218
Have I?

837
01:01:16,063 --> 01:01:18,088
We have to stick together.

838
01:01:19,867 --> 01:01:21,926
Right?

839
01:01:23,437 --> 01:01:25,871
Bobbie.

840
01:01:28,442 --> 01:01:30,706
- Yeah.
- All right.

841
01:01:38,619 --> 01:01:40,917
Rosie, are you sleeping?

842
01:01:40,954 --> 01:01:43,081
No, just resting.

843
01:01:43,123 --> 01:01:45,557
I brought you some chicken soup.

844
01:01:48,562 --> 01:01:50,359
You need something in your tummy.

845
01:01:50,397 --> 01:01:52,490
I'm not very hungry.

846
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,297
You can eat it later.

847
01:01:58,038 --> 01:02:01,405
Oh my God, every time I look
in the mirror these days

848
01:02:01,442 --> 01:02:03,933
I feel like it is going to crack.

849
01:02:10,117 --> 01:02:12,847
I wish there was something
I could do for you.

850
01:02:14,221 --> 01:02:17,816
There's nothing you can do.

851
01:02:17,858 --> 01:02:21,225
I know, that is what kills me.

852
01:02:27,167 --> 01:02:31,536
♪ Little baby,
don't say a word ♪

853
01:02:31,572 --> 01:02:36,100
♪ Mama's gonna to buy

854
01:02:36,143 --> 01:02:39,806

855

856
01:02:44,551 --> 01:02:47,349
Talk to me, Rosie.

857
01:02:47,387 --> 01:02:50,015
Tell me what is on your mind.

858
01:02:51,525 --> 01:02:54,187
I can't do this.

859
01:02:58,432 --> 01:03:01,401
I can't do this anymore, Sid.

860
01:03:02,703 --> 01:03:06,799
I didn't think we were
gonna to make it.

861
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,808
And I feel so guilty.

862
01:03:10,944 --> 01:03:13,071
I know.

863
01:03:13,113 --> 01:03:17,880
And I was so scared.
And I'm still scared.

864
01:03:18,986 --> 01:03:21,955
I just don't want to do this
shit anymore.

865
01:03:23,157 --> 01:03:25,591
I want to go home.

866
01:03:27,427 --> 01:03:30,260
I'm so sorry, Rosie.

867
01:03:30,297 --> 01:03:32,322
I'm so sorry. God.

868
01:03:37,371 --> 01:03:39,464
Listen to me.

869
01:03:39,506 --> 01:03:43,033
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to do.

870
01:03:43,076 --> 01:03:44,873
Do you hear me?

871
01:03:46,713 --> 01:03:49,204
Nobody is going to make
you do anything.

872
01:03:49,249 --> 01:03:51,217
I promise.

873
01:03:51,251 --> 01:03:52,650
Okay.

874
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:03,288
What have we gotten
you kids into.

875
01:04:08,435 --> 01:04:12,804
There's something else I've been
thinking about since we got here.

876
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:14,740
What is on your mind, darling?

877
01:04:16,476 --> 01:04:20,242
I think we should take things
back to the way they were before.

878
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:22,578
What do you mean?

879
01:04:23,984 --> 01:04:25,611
I mean without the kids.

880
01:04:34,995 --> 01:04:36,189
You want to dump...

881
01:04:39,533 --> 01:04:41,558
You want to you want to dump
Bobbie and Rosie?

882
01:04:44,538 --> 01:04:47,530
Well "dump" is a pretty harsh
way to put it.

883
01:04:47,574 --> 01:04:48,973
But I think we should...

884
01:04:49,009 --> 01:04:52,308
give them some money
and go our separate ways.

885
01:04:54,982 --> 01:04:57,246
Go off on our own again.

886
01:05:01,755 --> 01:05:04,121
- I thought you liked 'em?
- Yeah I like 'em.

887
01:05:04,157 --> 01:05:07,422
They're fine.
I love them, they're great.

888
01:05:08,996 --> 01:05:11,089
But I mean, what are we going to do?

889
01:05:11,131 --> 01:05:14,464
Spend the rest of our lives
with two people half our age?

890
01:05:14,501 --> 01:05:16,492
We have been doing real good together.

891
01:05:16,536 --> 01:05:18,527
They look up to us,
they need us, babe.

892
01:05:18,572 --> 01:05:20,597
What do they need us for?

893
01:05:20,641 --> 01:05:22,871
What do you think we are,
Ozzie and Harriet?

894
01:05:22,910 --> 01:05:24,741
Oh here we go. Here we go.

895
01:05:25,245 --> 01:05:27,907
I'm no role model.

896
01:05:27,948 --> 01:05:30,883
I'm a junkie and I'm a thief.

897
01:05:30,918 --> 01:05:32,545
So are you.

898
01:05:32,586 --> 01:05:36,989
This isn't good for them.
We got to let them go.

899
01:05:37,024 --> 01:05:40,050
These kids were using and stealing
long before they met up with us.

900
01:05:40,093 --> 01:05:42,891
Well, that doesn't make it okay.

901
01:05:45,232 --> 01:05:46,130
Then what?

902
01:05:51,138 --> 01:05:54,232
Okay, I'm not going
to argue with you.

903
01:05:54,274 --> 01:05:56,003
Especially when you've
been drinking.

904
01:05:57,611 --> 01:06:00,739
So why don't we just talk about
it another time?

905
01:06:00,781 --> 01:06:01,770
Okay?

906
01:06:09,256 --> 01:06:11,190
They go with us...

907
01:06:11,224 --> 01:06:12,953
and I don't want
to talk about it again.

908
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:22,027
You know you act tough.
But you are not.

909
01:06:22,069 --> 01:06:23,627
You're scared.

910
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:25,729
That is why you don't
want to let them go.

911
01:06:27,474 --> 01:06:29,908
Thanks for telling me
we are leaving tomorrow.

912
01:06:29,943 --> 01:06:31,103
Get the fuck out of here.

913
01:06:33,213 --> 01:06:34,874
Get the fuck out of here.

914
01:06:48,762 --> 01:06:50,286
Fuck me.

915
01:07:18,692 --> 01:07:21,320
Mingle boys, I have to talk
with my hoodlum friends.

916
01:07:28,035 --> 01:07:29,866
Hola, Melvin.

917
01:07:34,674 --> 01:07:36,335
You got a little glitter here.

918
01:07:36,376 --> 01:07:37,843
You got your little bat in here?

919
01:07:39,913 --> 01:07:42,404
Nice chickie you have there,
what is your pleasure?

920
01:07:42,449 --> 01:07:43,711
Give me a whiskey, a double.

921
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:52,384
So what is the score, baby?

922
01:07:52,426 --> 01:07:54,291
It is a jewelry store.

923
01:07:54,327 --> 01:07:58,286
The guarantee is fifty thousand
in uncirculated gold coins.

924
01:07:58,331 --> 01:08:00,891
Fucking great, a jewelry store.
Steel walls, steel floors...

925
01:08:00,934 --> 01:08:02,799
fucking silent alarm.
Closed circuit.

926
01:08:02,836 --> 01:08:04,064
You fucking brought me here for this?

927
01:08:04,104 --> 01:08:07,198
Mira, Mira.
It is an insurance score.

928
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:09,367
We make it look real
but there is no risk.

929
01:08:09,409 --> 01:08:11,309
What's an insurance score?

930
01:08:11,344 --> 01:08:14,108
Melvin, this one's still in diapers.

931
01:08:14,147 --> 01:08:17,844
The owner puts fifty thousand
in the safe, he claims a hundred.

932
01:08:17,884 --> 01:08:19,010
Everybody makes out.

933
01:08:22,956 --> 01:08:24,218
Where is my fucking drink, man.
Hey!

934
01:08:25,859 --> 01:08:27,383
- You look like shit.
- I'm fine.

935
01:08:27,427 --> 01:08:29,952
- So you'll do this?
- I just want my fucking drink.

936
01:08:29,996 --> 01:08:33,557
- So, it's on for tonight?
- Good, okay.

937
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:39,505
So what do you say we go to mi casa,
smoke some eska, get naked?

938
01:08:39,539 --> 01:08:41,336
What do you think Bobbie,
wanna get naked and bump dick heads?

939
01:08:41,374 --> 01:08:42,568
Fuck you, Melvin.

940
01:08:42,609 --> 01:08:44,543
- Fuck you.
- Want to rub the helmet?

941
01:08:44,578 --> 01:08:46,375
You never know until you try.

942
01:08:46,413 --> 01:08:47,880
I know man, I know.

943
01:08:49,282 --> 01:08:51,443
Mel, since when you start
running with niños anyway?

944
01:08:51,485 --> 01:08:52,884
Since he stopped running with faggots.

945
01:08:52,919 --> 01:08:54,716
Hey come on.
This is business here.

946
01:08:54,754 --> 01:08:56,449
Fucking cool out, will you?

947
01:08:56,490 --> 01:08:57,980
Let me tell you something,
little chicken.

948
01:08:58,024 --> 01:09:00,492
I can kick your ass as good
as I can fuck it.

949
01:09:02,362 --> 01:09:04,922
Why don't you fucking yell
faggots a little louder?

950
01:09:04,965 --> 01:09:07,331
Wait here, try not to get eaten
while I'm fucking gone.

951
01:09:29,890 --> 01:09:30,879
Here's the set up.

952
01:09:30,924 --> 01:09:32,551
I got time to study this
layout here?

953
01:09:36,196 --> 01:09:37,185
Mm-mmm...

954
01:09:37,230 --> 01:09:39,255
something nice is looking my way.

955
01:09:40,033 --> 01:09:42,399
He looks like a turnip with hair.

956
01:09:46,907 --> 01:09:48,807
- Call me before you leave tonight.
- I will.

957
01:09:48,842 --> 01:09:50,833
Hey, hey...
let's make some money, okay?

958
01:09:57,350 --> 01:10:00,148
- What is with the attitude?
- I don't have an attitude.

959
01:10:00,187 --> 01:10:02,212
- I just don't like it.
- You don't like it?

960
01:10:02,255 --> 01:10:03,449
What does that mean?

961
01:10:05,192 --> 01:10:07,683
You told me you only do jobs
that are a hundred percent kosher.

962
01:10:07,727 --> 01:10:08,455
Yeah.

963
01:10:08,495 --> 01:10:10,190
I don't feel a hundred percent kosher.

964
01:10:10,230 --> 01:10:11,492
What are you talking about?
You heard him.

965
01:10:11,531 --> 01:10:12,759
We are in, we are out.
No worries.

966
01:10:12,799 --> 01:10:15,461
Yeah, it is too fast.
We don't even know this guy.

967
01:10:15,502 --> 01:10:16,992
Did you fucking hear me?

968
01:10:17,037 --> 01:10:18,026
You're like a fucking cunt
or something.

969
01:10:18,071 --> 01:10:19,663
I've known Jewels
since before you were born.

970
01:10:19,706 --> 01:10:21,071
I'm not talking about Jewels.

971
01:10:21,107 --> 01:10:23,234
I'm talking about
the guy we are robbing.

972
01:10:23,276 --> 01:10:25,904
Why don't you tell
the whole fucking room?

973
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:29,373
It doesn't feel right to me.
It doesn't sound right.

974
01:10:29,416 --> 01:10:30,849
It doesn't feel right?
It doesn't sound right?

975
01:10:30,884 --> 01:10:32,681
I decide what fucking sounds
right around here.

976
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:34,016
Not you. All right?

977
01:10:34,054 --> 01:10:36,318
You didn't know shit before you met me.

978
01:10:36,356 --> 01:10:37,254
Now you're going to second-
guess my contacts,

979
01:10:37,290 --> 01:10:39,155
because you pulled off
a couple of chicken-shit jobs?

980
01:10:39,192 --> 01:10:41,456
I don't fucking think so.
I lead, you fucking follow.

981
01:10:41,494 --> 01:10:42,256
You got it?

982
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:45,530
Yeah. Have another drink, Mel.

983
01:10:51,705 --> 01:10:53,605
I'm sick and tired
of your fucking mouth.

984
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:55,369
- Hear me?
- I don't care.

985
01:10:55,408 --> 01:10:56,807
- You don't fucking care?
- No.

986
01:10:56,843 --> 01:10:58,242
You'll care when I throw your
fucking ass out in the street.

987
01:10:58,278 --> 01:11:00,337
Where would you be without me
you little cock-sucker?

988
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:03,178
- I'd be fine!
- You would be fucking fine?

989
01:11:03,216 --> 01:11:05,582
I don't fucking think so!
I don't think you would be fine.

990
01:11:05,619 --> 01:11:07,519
You know where you would be?
You would be fucking dead!

991
01:11:07,554 --> 01:11:10,455
That is where you would fucking be.
Right, you hear me?

992
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:12,253
Because this is the last time
I'm having this conversation with you.

993
01:11:12,292 --> 01:11:13,316
You understand?

994
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,191
We are going to do this fucking thing.
We are going to make some dough.

995
01:11:15,228 --> 01:11:17,719
We are going to get out of here.
So just try to be fucking cool!

996
01:11:17,764 --> 01:11:18,822
Okay?

997
01:11:19,399 --> 01:11:21,230
Hey, hey!

998
01:11:21,268 --> 01:11:22,792
What? Fuck, what!

999
01:11:22,836 --> 01:11:24,030
Rosie ain't coming, all right.

1000
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:25,765
I'm fucking devastated.
Rosie's not coming.

1001
01:11:25,805 --> 01:11:27,432
You think I give a shit?

1002
01:11:27,474 --> 01:11:29,874
Fine we don't need her.
You, me and Sid will do it.

1003
01:11:29,909 --> 01:11:31,536
Fucking pick up Rosie after.

1004
01:11:32,479 --> 01:11:34,310
Fine, whatever.

1005
01:11:36,683 --> 01:11:38,583
Hey. Trust me.

1006
01:12:01,041 --> 01:12:02,565
Rosie, what are you doing?

1007
01:12:03,943 --> 01:12:06,241
Hey, baby.

1008
01:12:06,279 --> 01:12:08,679
Hi. How are you?

1009
01:12:10,984 --> 01:12:12,884
Thank you, Bobbie.

1010
01:12:12,919 --> 01:12:15,945
- My protector.
- Yeah.

1011
01:12:15,989 --> 01:12:18,549
What is going on?
You never shoot.

1012
01:12:18,591 --> 01:12:21,822
I know, but me and Uncle Mel...

1013
01:12:21,861 --> 01:12:24,887
we have been doing
a little practicing...

1014
01:12:24,931 --> 01:12:27,365
during your long recovery.

1015
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:30,426
- Yeah?
- Hey, Bobbie.

1016
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:34,736
- Lets get high together, okay?
- I got to work, you know that.

1017
01:12:35,342 --> 01:12:38,573
Baby, come on.
Stay with me tonight.

1018
01:12:38,611 --> 01:12:39,976
Get high with me.

1019
01:12:40,013 --> 01:12:42,447
Oh babe, I can't. Not now.

1020
01:12:44,651 --> 01:12:46,585
Stop it. Come on.

1021
01:12:47,787 --> 01:12:49,880
Jesus, I can't. I gotta work.

1022
01:12:49,923 --> 01:12:52,289
Mel's waiting. I gotta work.

1023
01:12:52,325 --> 01:12:54,725
I don't want you to work.

1024
01:12:54,761 --> 01:12:56,729
I don't want you to go!
Don't go!

1025
01:12:56,763 --> 01:12:59,231
I don't want to go, too bad.
I got to work.

1026
01:12:59,265 --> 01:13:01,165
No Bobbie, don't leave.

1027
01:13:01,201 --> 01:13:04,329
Look at you, look at you.
You are all fucked up!

1028
01:13:04,371 --> 01:13:06,703
- So!
- So you got to maintain!

1029
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:09,937
You can't get this fucked up.
All right?

1030
01:13:09,976 --> 01:13:11,944
I'll be back in a couple
of hours.

1031
01:13:11,978 --> 01:13:13,172
I don't want you to go.

1032
01:13:13,213 --> 01:13:15,044
I'll be back in a couple
of hours.

1033
01:13:15,081 --> 01:13:17,242
Then I'll fuck you
all night long.

1034
01:13:18,118 --> 01:13:20,211
I don't want you to go.

1035
01:13:21,154 --> 01:13:25,921
I don't want you to go!
Bobbie, don't go, I love you!

1036
01:13:25,959 --> 01:13:28,894
- Oh fuck!
- I love you!

1037
01:13:28,928 --> 01:13:31,362
I don't want you to go!
I love you!

1038
01:13:34,234 --> 01:13:36,327
- You've got to maintain!
- Don't go!

1039
01:13:43,176 --> 01:13:44,837
Please!

1040
01:13:51,384 --> 01:13:53,978
Don't be a fucking pig junkie!
All right?

1041
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:55,783
I love you!

1042
01:13:55,822 --> 01:13:57,881
- You don't love anything.
- No!

1043
01:14:08,368 --> 01:14:10,268
Fuck you.

1044
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:39,825
Give me the big hammer.

1045
01:14:41,234 --> 01:14:43,168
That is the one. Okay.

1046
01:14:54,347 --> 01:14:56,941
Punch... and pull.

1047
01:15:04,724 --> 01:15:08,216
What the fuck?
What the fuck is going on?

1048
01:15:08,261 --> 01:15:10,229
We have been burnt.

1049
01:15:10,263 --> 01:15:13,664
Let's get the fuck out of here.
We'll deal with this later.

1050
01:15:14,767 --> 01:15:17,292
It was fucking empty.
Fucking empty!

1051
01:15:17,337 --> 01:15:19,805
All right!
I didn't say it was you, man!

1052
01:15:19,839 --> 01:15:21,397
I just fucking...

1053
01:15:21,441 --> 01:15:23,636
I just fucking got to know
where he lives!

1054
01:15:23,676 --> 01:15:25,507
Okay, all right.

1055
01:15:25,545 --> 01:15:27,410
No, I'm coming over, all right?

1056
01:15:29,415 --> 01:15:31,508
Jewels thinks he can find out
this guy's address,

1057
01:15:31,551 --> 01:15:33,348
but it is going to take
a few fucking hours.

1058
01:15:33,386 --> 01:15:35,354
So I'm going over to Jewel's place.

1059
01:15:35,388 --> 01:15:37,652
I'll drop you guys
at the fucking hotel.

1060
01:15:37,690 --> 01:15:40,386
So we will meet up after
I find out where this dead man lives.

1061
01:15:40,426 --> 01:15:42,394
- I'm out.
- No. Don't start your shit!

1062
01:15:42,428 --> 01:15:43,793
- I'm out!
- You are coming with us!

1063
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:45,161
- No, I'm not.
- Yes.

1064
01:15:45,198 --> 01:15:47,325
No, no, no!

1065
01:15:47,367 --> 01:15:49,665
This mother fucking cock-sucker
is going down.

1066
01:15:49,702 --> 01:15:52,637
And you are not going to dare
argue with me!

1067
01:15:52,672 --> 01:15:54,799
Now get in the fucking car,
both of you!

1068
01:15:54,841 --> 01:15:56,968
Sid, we can't do this.

1069
01:15:57,010 --> 01:16:00,377
God damn it,
get in the mother fucking car!

1070
01:16:04,751 --> 01:16:06,116
I don't want to fucking
listen to this fucking bullshit

1071
01:16:06,152 --> 01:16:07,710
from you every fucking time!

1072
01:16:07,754 --> 01:16:08,743
I want to be out!

1073
01:16:10,056 --> 01:16:12,388
Come on Rosie,
let's get the fuck out of here.

1074
01:16:12,425 --> 01:16:14,416
Mel's lost his shit.

1075
01:16:15,161 --> 01:16:16,458
Come on, we got to go
before he gets back.

1076
01:16:16,496 --> 01:16:19,795
Rosie.
Rosie, come on help me pack.

1077
01:16:22,535 --> 01:16:23,661
Rosie?

1078
01:16:37,317 --> 01:16:39,046
Rosie.

1079
01:16:39,085 --> 01:16:41,178
Rosie, baby.

1080
01:16:42,055 --> 01:16:43,818
Rosie!

1081
01:16:45,425 --> 01:16:47,154
Wake up!

1082
01:16:52,131 --> 01:16:54,224
Come on!

1083
01:16:55,234 --> 01:16:57,566
Please.

1084
01:16:57,604 --> 01:16:59,697
Wake up.

1085
01:17:06,546 --> 01:17:08,446
No.

1086
01:17:08,481 --> 01:17:10,278
Baby you're all I got!

1087
01:17:12,585 --> 01:17:15,611
Don't do this!

1088
01:17:17,323 --> 01:17:19,154
No!

1089
01:17:22,562 --> 01:17:24,052
You're all I...

1090
01:17:26,065 --> 01:17:27,430
You're all I have left.

1091
01:17:28,935 --> 01:17:32,063
Fucking bitch. Fucking bitch!

1092
01:17:32,105 --> 01:17:35,802
You fucking bitch!
Fucking bitch!

1093
01:17:49,589 --> 01:17:50,681
Fuck you!

1094
01:17:52,425 --> 01:17:53,687
Fuck!

1095
01:18:05,104 --> 01:18:07,538
Love you, baby.

1096
01:18:14,113 --> 01:18:16,638
Don't be dead.

1097
01:18:19,819 --> 01:18:21,548
Why?

1098
01:18:28,594 --> 01:18:30,118
Why?

1099
01:18:31,330 --> 01:18:32,888
Baby...

1100
01:18:32,932 --> 01:18:35,992
Baby, I love you.

1101
01:18:36,703 --> 01:18:38,864
Baby, I love you.

1102
01:18:40,306 --> 01:18:41,364
I love you.

1103
01:19:49,609 --> 01:19:51,236
Hey Bobbie, come on,
will you hurry up!

1104
01:19:51,277 --> 01:19:54,303
Fuck we have to go.
Could you walk any slower?

1105
01:19:55,515 --> 01:19:56,846
Where's Rosie?

1106
01:19:56,883 --> 01:19:59,113
- She ain't coming.
- The fuck she isn't.

1107
01:19:59,152 --> 01:20:00,585
Hey, you know
we're not coming back here.

1108
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:02,747
Once we get our money
we are fucking out of here.

1109
01:20:02,789 --> 01:20:04,984
Okay, so she is either with us,
or she is not.

1110
01:20:05,558 --> 01:20:06,855
- She is not.
- What?

1111
01:20:06,893 --> 01:20:08,861
Hey look, I don't have time
for this shit right now!

1112
01:20:08,895 --> 01:20:11,022
Just get your ass upstairs
and bring her down will you?

1113
01:20:11,063 --> 01:20:13,156
Fuck you, Mel.

1114
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:16,691
What did you say to me?
What did you just say?

1115
01:20:16,736 --> 01:20:18,431
She is not coming.

1116
01:20:20,072 --> 01:20:23,803
Mel, Rosie's not ready.
We are late, let's go.

1117
01:20:23,843 --> 01:20:26,004
What choice do we have?
Let's go.

1118
01:20:26,045 --> 01:20:27,637
Okay, but when I get back here,
if she is not ready.

1119
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:30,774
I'm going to leave her ass here.
Got it?

1120
01:20:30,817 --> 01:20:32,114
Okay? That is it.

1121
01:20:32,151 --> 01:20:34,051
Fuck it, you got it?

1122
01:20:42,728 --> 01:20:44,389
Here we go, right here.

1123
01:21:08,621 --> 01:21:10,282
Hey Bobbie...

1124
01:21:10,323 --> 01:21:11,051
come on.

1125
01:21:52,965 --> 01:21:54,956
Fucking Jewels.

1126
01:21:57,003 --> 01:21:59,597
You two stay here
while I check it out.

1127
01:22:00,706 --> 01:22:03,937
And don't fucking move
until I get back.

1128
01:22:15,454 --> 01:22:17,786
Bobbie. Wait, Bobbie.

1129
01:22:18,624 --> 01:22:20,319
You little piece of shit!

1130
01:22:20,359 --> 01:22:22,589
You look at me when
I'm talking to you!

1131
01:22:25,164 --> 01:22:27,394
Thanks for the fucking backup!

1132
01:22:27,433 --> 01:22:30,368
You believe this piece of shit
pulled a gun on me!

1133
01:22:30,403 --> 01:22:32,928
If I didn't know better I'd think
you were trying to piss me off!

1134
01:22:32,972 --> 01:22:34,599
Hit him again and I'll kill you!

1135
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:36,437
Get the fucking thing off me,
this is business!

1136
01:22:36,475 --> 01:22:38,966
Fuck you, this ain't business,
this is bullshit!

1137
01:22:39,011 --> 01:22:41,809
- Mother fucker, I'll kill you!
- Think you are that fast?

1138
01:22:41,847 --> 01:22:43,610
No, you are not that fast.

1139
01:22:43,649 --> 01:22:45,173
Hey Bobbie, what is up with the man?

1140
01:22:45,217 --> 01:22:47,742
This fucker robs us
and you put a gun to my head?

1141
01:22:47,787 --> 01:22:49,015
This is not cool, esse.

1142
01:22:49,055 --> 01:22:51,046
Why don't you sit the fuck down
and shut the fuck up

1143
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:52,990
so I don't have to shoot
you in the head?

1144
01:22:53,025 --> 01:22:54,959
Huh, esse?

1145
01:22:54,994 --> 01:22:57,554
- Bobbie, what are you doing?
- Look.

1146
01:22:57,596 --> 01:23:00,724
Fuck! Shit. Jesus Christ.

1147
01:23:00,766 --> 01:23:03,894
Come here, hold still.
God damn it, hold still!

1148
01:23:03,936 --> 01:23:05,460
Fuck!

1149
01:23:08,074 --> 01:23:10,304
My God, why are you
doing this to us?

1150
01:23:10,343 --> 01:23:12,140
- Where is your safe?
- We don't have it.

1151
01:23:12,178 --> 01:23:15,170
Everything that we have is in
the safe at the store.

1152
01:23:15,214 --> 01:23:16,977
- Please.
- Oh fuck lady, listen!

1153
01:23:17,016 --> 01:23:19,610
We have been to the God damn store.
We have been in the God damn safe!

1154
01:23:19,652 --> 01:23:22,780
And you know what we found?
Absolutely fucking nothing!

1155
01:23:22,822 --> 01:23:24,255
Now listen to me!

1156
01:23:24,290 --> 01:23:26,281
I'm trying to keep you fucking alive.

1157
01:23:26,325 --> 01:23:28,418
All we want is what is ours.

1158
01:23:28,461 --> 01:23:31,191
Now if you will take me to the safe,
then we will leave.

1159
01:23:33,299 --> 01:23:34,994
Okay.

1160
01:23:35,034 --> 01:23:36,865
Fuck!

1161
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:40,701
You piece of shit,
you lying asshole!

1162
01:23:40,740 --> 01:23:43,072
Shut up lady, come on!

1163
01:23:44,877 --> 01:23:49,541
It is obvious to me
that this is not your thing.

1164
01:23:51,650 --> 01:23:53,140
You're a good kid, Bobbie.

1165
01:23:53,185 --> 01:23:55,312
You just got caught up
with the wrong crowd.

1166
01:23:58,891 --> 01:24:00,620
You probably come from
a broken home.

1167
01:24:00,659 --> 01:24:02,684
Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up!

1168
01:24:02,728 --> 01:24:04,423
- Okay!
- Shut the fuck up!

1169
01:24:04,463 --> 01:24:07,125
- Now!
- I'm sorry.

1170
01:24:07,166 --> 01:24:09,600
Hey chickie, show him
you got some balls, go ahead.

1171
01:24:09,635 --> 01:24:14,197
Don't let him hit me, Bobbie.
Please? Thank you.

1172
01:24:15,174 --> 01:24:16,471
For a fucking idiot...

1173
01:24:16,509 --> 01:24:19,034
What the fuck do you think
you are talking about!

1174
01:24:19,078 --> 01:24:22,275
Where are the fucking jewels,
you mother fucker!

1175
01:24:22,314 --> 01:24:24,714
I will shoot you
in the fucking head!

1176
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:27,184
- Son of a bitch!
- Jewels!

1177
01:24:27,219 --> 01:24:29,619
Now!

1178
01:24:32,892 --> 01:24:34,985
Fucking shit!

1179
01:24:35,027 --> 01:24:37,120
What the fuck happened?

1180
01:24:41,801 --> 01:24:44,599
Oh shit! Fuck!

1181
01:24:44,637 --> 01:24:48,835
Bobbie, what have you done to us?
What the fuck have you done!

1182
01:24:48,874 --> 01:24:51,206
Shit! Fuck!

1183
01:25:00,586 --> 01:25:01,484
Fuck!

1184
01:25:08,327 --> 01:25:11,228
Mel, we got to get out of here.
Lady, listen to me.

1185
01:25:11,263 --> 01:25:13,322
In fifteen minutes you call the cops.

1186
01:25:13,365 --> 01:25:16,300
And you tell them
you just shot a burglar.

1187
01:25:16,335 --> 01:25:17,962
Come on, Mel.

1188
01:25:18,304 --> 01:25:20,772
Mel, you probably
come from a broken family.

1189
01:25:37,523 --> 01:25:40,424
No Mel.

1190
01:25:41,427 --> 01:25:44,453
Sorry.

1191
01:25:44,497 --> 01:25:47,591
God damn it!
You didn't have to kill them.

1192
01:25:47,633 --> 01:25:49,692
- You didn't have to!
- I had to!

1193
01:25:49,735 --> 01:25:53,136
They would have fingered us all.
Murder one, Sidney.

1194
01:25:53,172 --> 01:25:56,266
Life in prison, worse.

1195
01:25:58,410 --> 01:26:00,901
No, you didn't have
to kill them.

1196
01:26:04,350 --> 01:26:06,545
We got to get out of here.

1197
01:26:24,737 --> 01:26:26,762
Fuck me.

1198
01:26:39,718 --> 01:26:41,652
You really fucked it up good
this time didn't you, Bobbie?

1199
01:26:41,687 --> 01:26:44,918
God damn, you really fucking did!
Jewels has a huge fucking crew!

1200
01:26:44,957 --> 01:26:46,788
He's got people everywhere.

1201
01:26:46,825 --> 01:26:48,986
This is like having a fucking
price on our head!

1202
01:26:49,028 --> 01:26:51,019
- Mel.
- No, God damn, no Sid!

1203
01:26:51,063 --> 01:26:53,827
Stop fucking making excuses
for him!

1204
01:26:53,866 --> 01:26:56,596
God damn it!
He fucked us up good!

1205
01:26:56,635 --> 01:26:58,398
And you fucking know it!

1206
01:26:58,437 --> 01:27:00,200
What did I ever fucking do to you,
you little prick,

1207
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:02,036
that you would fuck me like this?!

1208
01:27:02,074 --> 01:27:03,098
I take you in,
I teach you the ropes!

1209
01:27:03,142 --> 01:27:06,441
I give you my money.
My fucking dope!

1210
01:27:06,478 --> 01:27:09,743
I make you part of my crew!
This is my fucking payback?!

1211
01:27:09,782 --> 01:27:12,080
This is my fucking payback!
You shit!

1212
01:27:12,117 --> 01:27:14,210
- Mel!
- You fucking little shit!

1213
01:27:14,253 --> 01:27:17,347
- Mother fucker!
- Shut the fuck up!

1214
01:27:17,389 --> 01:27:21,849
Shut up! Jesus Christ! Shut up!

1215
01:27:21,894 --> 01:27:24,021
Come on, everything is cool.
Everything is fine!

1216
01:27:24,063 --> 01:27:27,555
We got the money! We are out of there,
we are all right.

1217
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:29,830
Oh don't get me fucking started on that!

1218
01:27:29,868 --> 01:27:32,462
We never should have left him
alone in there!

1219
01:27:32,504 --> 01:27:36,031
Oh God, this whole thing is such
a fucking, fucking mess!

1220
01:27:36,075 --> 01:27:39,340
And now, to top it off,
I got to go back to the motel.

1221
01:27:39,378 --> 01:27:41,403
And pick up his fucking girlfriend,

1222
01:27:41,447 --> 01:27:44,245
who is too fucking good to work
with the rest of us!

1223
01:27:44,283 --> 01:27:46,478
- She is dead.
- What?

1224
01:27:46,518 --> 01:27:48,748
What did you fucking say to me?
What did you fucking say to me!

1225
01:27:48,787 --> 01:27:50,516
I said she is fucking
dead you asshole!

1226
01:27:50,556 --> 01:27:52,854
So she won't
fuck up your perfect plan!

1227
01:27:57,429 --> 01:27:59,829
Oh my God.

1228
01:28:00,633 --> 01:28:02,032
Fuck you!

1229
01:28:06,038 --> 01:28:07,505
- Mel!
- Fuck you!

1230
01:28:07,539 --> 01:28:09,166
Stop it!

1231
01:28:12,911 --> 01:28:16,870
Oh God! Oh God!

1232
01:28:16,915 --> 01:28:19,907
Oh God! Oh Bobbie, I'm sorry.

1233
01:28:24,023 --> 01:28:26,150
You asshole.

1234
01:28:26,191 --> 01:28:28,022
Shit.

1235
01:28:34,667 --> 01:28:35,691
I need an enema.

1236
01:28:53,686 --> 01:28:56,177
Pull over at that gas station.

1237
01:29:16,075 --> 01:29:18,009
Fill her up.

1238
01:29:22,548 --> 01:29:25,608
All right, champ.
You pull point on potty patrol.

1239
01:30:02,321 --> 01:30:04,585
Sid, you know what we have to do.

1240
01:30:07,025 --> 01:30:08,049
You can't be serious.

1241
01:30:08,093 --> 01:30:09,560
I'm not having a fucking
discussion here.

1242
01:30:09,595 --> 01:30:11,688
We got no choice and you know it.

1243
01:30:11,730 --> 01:30:15,291
I can't believe you even said that.

1244
01:30:15,334 --> 01:30:17,268
This is Bobbie.

1245
01:30:17,302 --> 01:30:20,794
He saved your life, remember?

1246
01:30:21,607 --> 01:30:23,336
Yeah, I remember.
So we are even.

1247
01:30:23,375 --> 01:30:25,536
This is not about friendship.
This is not about love.

1248
01:30:25,577 --> 01:30:27,306
This is fucking survival.

1249
01:30:28,747 --> 01:30:30,044
Why don't we just let him go?

1250
01:30:30,082 --> 01:30:31,344
We can drop him off in
Springfield.

1251
01:30:31,383 --> 01:30:32,680
I can't do that!

1252
01:30:32,718 --> 01:30:34,242
Look, he is the only one
who can finger us.

1253
01:30:34,286 --> 01:30:37,414
And the only sure way out
for him is to cop a plea.

1254
01:30:37,456 --> 01:30:39,253
We go away for life
and he walks.

1255
01:30:39,291 --> 01:30:40,849
I can't live with those odds.

1256
01:30:40,893 --> 01:30:43,123
- Mel, no.
- I did not create this mess.

1257
01:30:43,162 --> 01:30:45,528
I am not the one who went
apeshit and shot Jewels.

1258
01:30:45,564 --> 01:30:49,000
Bobbie blew it,
you play, you fucking pay.

1259
01:30:49,034 --> 01:30:51,332
No, you fucking blew it.

1260
01:30:51,370 --> 01:30:55,170
- What did you say to me?
- I'm saying this is your mess.

1261
01:30:55,207 --> 01:30:59,075
Okay, this plan was a fucked up
stupid idea from the beginning.

1262
01:30:59,111 --> 01:31:01,443
And none of us wanted to do it.

1263
01:31:03,182 --> 01:31:04,774
I mean you put us all
in danger, Mel.

1264
01:31:04,817 --> 01:31:08,344
Bobbie is our family.
Now what do you want to do?

1265
01:31:08,387 --> 01:31:11,686
You want to put him in a fucking
cornfield because you fucked up?

1266
01:31:11,723 --> 01:31:15,591
- No!
- Don't you say another word!

1267
01:31:15,627 --> 01:31:17,993
One more word, and I swear...

1268
01:31:18,030 --> 01:31:20,555
I'll put you in the ground
right along next to him.

1269
01:31:20,599 --> 01:31:22,726
Now look...

1270
01:31:22,768 --> 01:31:27,330
I know that I haven't
been as tight as usual.

1271
01:31:28,540 --> 01:31:29,529
I have been drinking too much.

1272
01:31:31,109 --> 01:31:32,542
And I'm still fucked up
from being shot.

1273
01:31:33,946 --> 01:31:38,178
But I am clear now.
I am clear as a mother fucker.

1274
01:31:39,351 --> 01:31:40,443
Now we got about
eighty grand back there,

1275
01:31:40,486 --> 01:31:43,046
we got this one small problem
to take care of now.

1276
01:31:43,088 --> 01:31:45,352
And I will deal with Jewels'
crew later.

1277
01:31:45,390 --> 01:31:48,154
Everything is going to be cool.
I got it all worked out, okay?

1278
01:31:48,193 --> 01:31:49,490
So...

1279
01:31:52,898 --> 01:31:54,866
We'll do this tonight.

1280
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:56,925
The sooner, the better.

1281
01:31:56,969 --> 01:31:59,233
Once it is dark, you are going
to pull over to a cornfield...

1282
01:31:59,271 --> 01:32:01,000
to take a piss.

1283
01:32:01,039 --> 01:32:03,030
And I'll take care of everything.

1284
01:32:04,676 --> 01:32:07,110
All you got to do is help
with the body.

1285
01:32:09,715 --> 01:32:12,843
- Okay.
- All right then.

1286
01:32:12,885 --> 01:32:16,150
So you get in there
and buy us a fucking shovel.

1287
01:32:55,827 --> 01:32:56,725
Bobbie?

1288
01:32:58,664 --> 01:32:59,653
Bobbie.

1289
01:33:04,670 --> 01:33:08,367
Sid, I love you but
I can't do this anymore.

1290
01:33:08,407 --> 01:33:10,932
I was going to leave this
morning with Rosie.

1291
01:33:12,210 --> 01:33:14,041
Bobbie, I have about ten
seconds.

1292
01:33:14,079 --> 01:33:15,979
Here, take this and get
the fuck out of here.

1293
01:33:16,014 --> 01:33:17,641
No, I don't want your money,
I just want to get dropped off

1294
01:33:17,683 --> 01:33:20,208
somewhere so I can fucking
figure out my life.

1295
01:33:20,252 --> 01:33:21,651
I'm going to go tell Mel now.

1296
01:33:21,687 --> 01:33:23,746
No, you can't go back
in the car.

1297
01:33:23,789 --> 01:33:25,780
Listen to me,
Mel is going to kill you.

1298
01:33:50,015 --> 01:33:52,984
Run, okay? Go fast.

1299
01:34:26,818 --> 01:34:30,117
Here's your fucking shovel.

1300
01:34:38,930 --> 01:34:40,659
So where the fuck is Bobbie?

1301
01:34:40,699 --> 01:34:43,497
Far away from here by now.

1302
01:34:47,372 --> 01:34:49,135
Fuck!

1303
01:35:31,683 --> 01:35:33,708
Mind your own business.
