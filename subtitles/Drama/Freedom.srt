<i>Based on real events</i>

3
00:02:52,903 --> 00:02:54,758
We can't get across!

4
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:02,722
Oh, my God!

5
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,455
Puri Dai, we can't go on.

6
00:03:07,656 --> 00:03:10,559
The ditch is too wide!

7
00:03:11,241 --> 00:03:14,307
- I just saw him.
- He's not far.

8
00:03:57,262 --> 00:03:58,277
Got you!

9
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,109
We've got the ghost!

10
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,029
Why do you follow us?

11
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:20,039
Who are you?

12
00:04:20,881 --> 00:04:22,954
You scared me yesterday.

13
00:04:23,345 --> 00:04:24,490
Ghost.

14
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,257
Ghost.

15
00:04:37,714 --> 00:04:38,608
He's white!

16
00:04:38,707 --> 00:04:40,114
Why do you follow us?

17
00:04:41,331 --> 00:04:42,825
I'm all alone.

18
00:04:43,764 --> 00:04:45,804
We don't want trouble.

19
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:48,883
You must go back to your people.

20
00:04:50,228 --> 00:04:53,228
Did you pinch
the charcoal burner's bread?

21
00:04:57,557 --> 00:05:01,038
This little <i>gadjo</i>
is one hell of a thief.

22
00:05:02,197 --> 00:05:04,532
What shall we do with him?

23
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,790
Come here.

24
00:05:08,598 --> 00:05:09,525
Sit.

25
00:05:11,255 --> 00:05:12,499
Chouroro!

26
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,352
Eat.

27
00:05:25,112 --> 00:05:26,094
Here.

28
00:05:33,049 --> 00:05:34,805
The children hate these roots.

29
00:05:34,906 --> 00:05:36,499
We eat what we find.

30
00:05:36,601 --> 00:05:41,010
With the Germans on our backs,
we have to keep going.

31
00:05:41,402 --> 00:05:44,272
God is going to come to our rescue.

32
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,321
Chouroro!

33
00:06:09,822 --> 00:06:11,480
Pick everything.

34
00:06:53,058 --> 00:06:54,782
The Germans! On the road!

35
00:06:54,883 --> 00:06:55,646
What?

36
00:06:55,747 --> 00:06:57,405
I saw Germans on the road.

37
00:07:00,131 --> 00:07:01,538
They're coming!

38
00:07:26,694 --> 00:07:28,385
TOWN HaLL

39
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,207
are you Theodore Rosier?

40
00:07:39,304 --> 00:07:40,864
Let's go.

41
00:08:01,226 --> 00:08:02,274
What's his name?

42
00:08:02,795 --> 00:08:03,875
Otto.

43
00:08:05,547 --> 00:08:07,173
I'll look after you, Otto.

44
00:08:12,587 --> 00:08:14,344
What have you fed him?

45
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:15,428
Meat.

46
00:08:33,134 --> 00:08:34,345
Tatane...

47
00:08:35,311 --> 00:08:37,384
What does "chouroro" mean?

48
00:08:38,671 --> 00:08:40,078
a pauper.

49
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,781
The gypsies are back!

50
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,508
The gypsies are here!

51
00:09:28,405 --> 00:09:30,030
The gypsies are back!

52
00:10:00,857 --> 00:10:02,035
Thank you.

53
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:12,697
Thank you.

54
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:40,276
Thank you.

55
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,766
What's going on?

56
00:11:01,855 --> 00:11:04,408
Honestly!
Stamping his backside...

57
00:11:10,273 --> 00:11:11,287
Hello.

58
00:11:15,489 --> 00:11:16,472
Thank you.

59
00:11:21,154 --> 00:11:23,194
We'll give you ration cards.

60
00:11:24,258 --> 00:11:26,233
How long will you stay here?

61
00:11:26,434 --> 00:11:29,696
We've come for the grape harvest.
after, we leave.

62
00:11:31,171 --> 00:11:35,328
a new law forbids you to be nomads,
even with passbooks.

63
00:11:35,523 --> 00:11:37,979
We never stay too long in one place.

64
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,642
Our life is the road.

65
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:44,476
Come, I'll show you something.

66
00:11:46,565 --> 00:11:49,413
"The President of the French Republic

00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:55,740
"The movement of nomads

"Punishable by a prison sentence
of one to five years. "

71
00:12:03,814 --> 00:12:06,630
This law forbids you to be nomads.

72
00:12:07,111 --> 00:12:10,046
You'll be in danger
if you keep traveling.

73
00:12:11,176 --> 00:12:12,583
You could be arrested.

74
00:12:14,344 --> 00:12:16,613
- We must leave here.
- Stop!

75
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:20,103
We stay for the grape harvest.

76
00:12:20,457 --> 00:12:22,312
We'll be trapped.

77
00:12:22,504 --> 00:12:23,999
You must do as they say

78
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,405
or they'll put you in prison.

79
00:12:26,505 --> 00:12:27,749
There's a war on.

80
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,263
- It's serious.
- It's your war.

81
00:12:31,466 --> 00:12:34,084
We gypsies have never gone to war.

82
00:13:15,056 --> 00:13:15,754
Chouroro!

83
00:13:28,017 --> 00:13:29,293
Got him!

84
00:13:31,953 --> 00:13:33,262
No!

85
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,871
We've caught Chouroro!

86
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:49,772
What's your name?

87
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:52,012
Chouroro!

88
00:13:53,588 --> 00:13:55,049
Put him down, please.

89
00:13:55,316 --> 00:13:56,331
Put him down!

90
00:14:00,885 --> 00:14:03,984
Don't be afraid.
I'm here to help you.

91
00:14:05,301 --> 00:14:06,708
What's your name?

92
00:14:08,693 --> 00:14:09,555
What's your name?

93
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,633
Claude.

94
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,975
Claude what?

95
00:14:15,191 --> 00:14:16,238
Ch?ant.

96
00:14:16,343 --> 00:14:18,350
They say you're an orphan?

97
00:14:19,223 --> 00:14:20,783
are your parents dead?

98
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:22,988
Yes.

99
00:14:24,536 --> 00:14:27,602
Where did you live
before they found you?

100
00:14:28,056 --> 00:14:29,136
With people.

101
00:14:29,656 --> 00:14:31,063
They took you in?

102
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,021
Yes.

103
00:14:32,536 --> 00:14:35,187
But there wasn't enough food for me.

104
00:14:35,897 --> 00:14:38,548
They wanted to put me in a home.

105
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:41,847
I didn't want to go.

106
00:14:57,467 --> 00:14:58,874
I won't go to a home!

107
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,665
You can stay here for now.

108
00:15:01,212 --> 00:15:02,673
Then we'll see.

109
00:15:04,252 --> 00:15:06,041
It's my uncle. Fernand.

110
00:15:13,117 --> 00:15:14,743
Is this the young devil?

111
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,392
Well then...

112
00:15:18,782 --> 00:15:20,920
I found these. Try them on.

113
00:15:22,398 --> 00:15:23,064
No.

114
00:15:24,063 --> 00:15:25,950
I don't like short pants.

115
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,348
I have these too.

116
00:15:30,143 --> 00:15:33,340
Short pants too,
but you wear them at your age.

117
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:37,305
I wore short pants at your age,
so did Theo.

118
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:42,877
Is he going to be trouble?

119
00:15:44,705 --> 00:15:48,185
Put your shoes on
and go to get wood for the stove.

120
00:15:54,658 --> 00:15:56,119
Send him to the orphanage.

121
00:15:56,226 --> 00:15:59,871
- He's scared of going there.
- Why? Has he been before?

122
00:16:00,066 --> 00:16:00,895
I don't know.

123
00:16:00,995 --> 00:16:02,850
You don't know who he is.

124
00:16:03,043 --> 00:16:05,345
You don't know
what's he's been through.

125
00:16:05,987 --> 00:16:07,548
You're taking a risk.

126
00:16:09,347 --> 00:16:10,427
Good morning, children.

127
00:16:10,628 --> 00:16:13,148
Good morning, Miss Lundi.

128
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:14,526
Sit down.

129
00:16:19,556 --> 00:16:21,924
a lesson...

130
00:16:22,021 --> 00:16:23,909
in morals.

131
00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:27,363
Is it true the gypsies brought you?

132
00:16:28,518 --> 00:16:31,867
My dad says
the gypsies steal children!

133
00:16:31,974 --> 00:16:33,797
Leave me alone.

134
00:16:33,991 --> 00:16:35,747
Quiet, that's enough now.

135
00:16:36,742 --> 00:16:38,466
Pots and pans!

136
00:16:39,335 --> 00:16:40,742
any pots to mend?

137
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:44,320
any pots to mend?

138
00:16:47,496 --> 00:16:49,121
Pots and pans!

139
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,011
We don't need anything.

140
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,826
- any pots to mend?
- Lace!

141
00:16:55,657 --> 00:16:58,308
any pots to mend?
Pots and pans!

142
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,033
Thread, scissors.

143
00:17:00,233 --> 00:17:01,859
We don't need anything!

144
00:17:02,057 --> 00:17:04,775
Madam, Italian lace.

145
00:17:05,194 --> 00:17:07,496
We mend pots, we repair holes.

146
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,414
No holes in my pots!

147
00:17:10,698 --> 00:17:13,066
Holes can hide sometimes.

148
00:17:32,974 --> 00:17:35,560
Ladies and gentlemen, music for you.

149
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:44,299
Look... it's from Hungary.

150
00:17:50,991 --> 00:17:52,268
Mr. Raisin!

151
00:17:53,936 --> 00:17:57,068
- Buy a basket?
- No, I want hoop nets.

152
00:17:57,264 --> 00:17:58,279
Hoop nets?

153
00:18:02,737 --> 00:18:03,665
Tina...

154
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:07,726
Hello. We haven't seen you
since the war started.

155
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:10,705
Tools, sir?

156
00:18:11,058 --> 00:18:12,618
You don't want to buy?

157
00:18:47,318 --> 00:18:49,423
a motor car!

158
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,174
It's Pierre Pentecote!

159
00:19:05,368 --> 00:19:06,296
Hello, Pierre.

160
00:19:06,488 --> 00:19:07,088
Hi.

161
00:19:07,288 --> 00:19:09,842
It's good to see a friend.

162
00:19:10,521 --> 00:19:11,120
a glass!

163
00:19:11,768 --> 00:19:12,848
a chair!

164
00:19:29,755 --> 00:19:30,999
Where's the glass?

165
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,840
We can only offer you water.

166
00:19:39,036 --> 00:19:40,411
Thank you.

167
00:19:42,396 --> 00:19:43,640
It's okay, thank you.

168
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:09,822
Come here, pal.

169
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:24,443
- Still run that dance hall in Villers?
- Of course.

170
00:20:24,834 --> 00:20:26,809
We'd like to play there again.

171
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:29,912
People just want
tangos and waltzes now.

172
00:20:30,114 --> 00:20:31,576
We know songs from Russia,

173
00:20:31,778 --> 00:20:32,923
Macedonia...

174
00:20:34,563 --> 00:20:36,123
are the horses new?

175
00:20:37,443 --> 00:20:39,134
all three are Spanish.

176
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,104
Spanish...

177
00:20:57,893 --> 00:20:59,901
This village isn't like before.

178
00:21:00,838 --> 00:21:02,780
Everyone has changed.

179
00:21:03,334 --> 00:21:06,018
Pierre Pentecote
isn't a friend anymore.

180
00:21:06,215 --> 00:21:08,898
He didn't come here just to say hello.

181
00:21:09,095 --> 00:21:11,332
We'll wash the horse's paint off.

182
00:21:11,719 --> 00:21:13,923
We'll make it old again

183
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,222
and no one will be able to accuse us.

184
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,936
Later, when we want to sell it,

185
00:21:20,136 --> 00:21:21,663
we'll make it young again.

186
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,483
Pierre Pentecote had something in mind.

187
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:28,549
My brother,
we must dance with the snake.

188
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,977
Stop it!

189
00:22:00,204 --> 00:22:01,514
Shut up!

190
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:10,402
Hello.

191
00:22:14,862 --> 00:22:16,269
Come here.

192
00:22:23,472 --> 00:22:24,552
Come closer.

193
00:22:34,673 --> 00:22:36,014
What's your name?

194
00:22:37,521 --> 00:22:38,928
Why?

195
00:22:41,649 --> 00:22:44,333
Because my name is Miss Lundi.

196
00:22:45,938 --> 00:22:47,498
I'm Tatane.

197
00:22:48,914 --> 00:22:50,475
Can you read and write?

198
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:52,749
That's not for us.

199
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,398
What's she doing here?

200
00:22:56,787 --> 00:22:58,794
She's come to steal our men.

201
00:23:01,108 --> 00:23:02,930
Good morning, madam.

202
00:23:03,028 --> 00:23:05,898
I work at the town hall.
I teach in St. amont too.

203
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,304
May your clothes tear

204
00:23:08,501 --> 00:23:10,705
and may you grow old in good health.

205
00:23:13,173 --> 00:23:15,213
The children must come to school.

206
00:23:15,414 --> 00:23:18,261
They should learn to read and write.

207
00:23:18,614 --> 00:23:22,030
all right.
How much will you pay for that?

208
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:23,798
What?

209
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,679
Pay them to learn?

210
00:23:25,879 --> 00:23:28,945
With nothing in return,
our children stay here.

211
00:23:29,143 --> 00:23:30,321
They have better to do.

212
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:31,534
Such as?

213
00:23:36,728 --> 00:23:38,222
We don't leave our children.

214
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:39,893
They're always with us.

215
00:23:40,344 --> 00:23:42,286
I'll do it. For an apple.

216
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:43,950
I like apples.

217
00:23:51,258 --> 00:23:53,647
They're at the market in Villers.

218
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:57,139
It's the mare with the white foot.

219
00:23:57,819 --> 00:23:58,997
Get a lead, Claude.

220
00:23:59,194 --> 00:24:00,950
She took ill earlier.

221
00:24:01,531 --> 00:24:04,378
She fell an hour ago
and only just got up.

222
00:24:10,748 --> 00:24:11,730
I'll tether the stallion.

223
00:24:12,796 --> 00:24:14,706
Careful, he's a mad one.

224
00:24:28,126 --> 00:24:30,428
Come on, boy.

225
00:24:41,247 --> 00:24:44,695
It's bad. I need hot water
and a bottle of oil!

226
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,262
I'll take her to the stable.

227
00:24:46,464 --> 00:24:48,025
Young Claude, my bag.

228
00:25:16,644 --> 00:25:18,051
Bring me my bag.

229
00:25:25,445 --> 00:25:26,907
Her heartbeat's slow.

230
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,149
The green box in my bag.

231
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,290
- The horse, Theodore!
- Get back!

232
00:26:27,244 --> 00:26:28,521
a ghost!

233
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:36,771
The mad horse!

234
00:26:41,709 --> 00:26:42,724
Kako!

235
00:26:58,768 --> 00:27:02,630
Dear God, what's wrong,
my girl, my sweet, my doll?

236
00:27:06,768 --> 00:27:08,940
Tie the scarf tight!

237
00:27:15,057 --> 00:27:17,261
Little doll, get up...

238
00:27:23,795 --> 00:27:26,730
Stroke her ears.

239
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:41,034
Mandra, put an egg on it!

240
00:27:41,236 --> 00:27:42,218
That's good.

241
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:51,890
Taloche, your egg.

242
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,149
This will do him good.

243
00:28:11,352 --> 00:28:13,457
The cow dung will make him better.

244
00:28:13,657 --> 00:28:15,031
Tie it tight.

245
00:28:15,225 --> 00:28:17,876
Great Lord, great Christ,
great Virgin...

246
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:22,001
Help our dear friend to rise again.

247
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:25,431
She has helped a lot,
she must be rewarded for it.

248
00:28:27,482 --> 00:28:28,889
What's going on?

249
00:28:32,859 --> 00:28:33,874
Theodore?

250
00:28:35,995 --> 00:28:37,424
What have you put on him?

251
00:28:38,043 --> 00:28:40,345
It heals, Miss Lundi.

252
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,467
What is it?

253
00:28:42,427 --> 00:28:44,183
It will heal him.

254
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:46,363
The horse has woken!

255
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,290
Great and beautiful God!
Let me eat your shit!

256
00:29:34,114 --> 00:29:35,194
Chouroro.

257
00:29:48,516 --> 00:29:49,628
What's this?

258
00:29:51,844 --> 00:29:53,405
Theodore sent this.

259
00:29:57,988 --> 00:30:00,771
By Saint Sarah!

260
00:30:03,013 --> 00:30:04,443
The apple for Taloche!

261
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,590
Bread.

262
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:08,253
Pork fat.

263
00:30:08,934 --> 00:30:10,527
Chavo, the knife.

264
00:30:20,007 --> 00:30:21,217
For the children.

265
00:30:51,467 --> 00:30:53,572
Thank him, by Saint Sarah.

266
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:04,139
He wants to know
what you put on the bite.

267
00:31:05,773 --> 00:31:08,326
He mustn't remove it.
It will heal him.

268
00:31:09,261 --> 00:31:10,668
Come here, Chouroro.

269
00:31:13,358 --> 00:31:15,081
Tell him, if God wills it,

270
00:31:15,437 --> 00:31:17,226
even a broom can fire a shot.

271
00:31:23,247 --> 00:31:25,451
Well, what did they tell you?

272
00:31:25,646 --> 00:31:29,608
They said that if God wills it,
even a rag can heal.

273
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,501
What?

274
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:32,936
No, that's not it.

275
00:31:33,327 --> 00:31:35,783
They said that if God wills it,

276
00:31:36,016 --> 00:31:37,805
even a ram...

277
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,067
no, even a broom can fire shots.

278
00:31:41,616 --> 00:31:42,860
What are you talking about?

279
00:31:43,057 --> 00:31:44,519
That's what they said.

280
00:32:06,452 --> 00:32:08,907
Get up! Time for Miss Lundi!

281
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,289
Get up!

282
00:32:13,524 --> 00:32:15,467
Cali!

283
00:32:17,492 --> 00:32:18,441
Get up!

284
00:32:19,381 --> 00:32:20,210
Come on!

285
00:32:30,934 --> 00:32:32,909
Cali! Quick!

286
00:32:53,529 --> 00:32:54,544
Hurry up!

287
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,258
Hello, Miss Lundi.

288
00:33:23,613 --> 00:33:25,784
Taloche! One biscuit.

289
00:33:26,749 --> 00:33:27,698
Just one.

290
00:34:33,797 --> 00:34:36,645
Taloche, go and sit down.

291
00:34:40,326 --> 00:34:41,886
Go back to your seat.

292
00:34:54,151 --> 00:34:55,329
Chouroro!

293
00:34:57,864 --> 00:35:01,181
In the silent and perfumed garden

294
00:35:02,921 --> 00:35:04,197
with its distant...

295
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:14,049
We'll be back, Miss Lundi.

296
00:35:16,042 --> 00:35:17,765
Get out your passbooks!

297
00:35:19,403 --> 00:35:21,126
Come out of there!

298
00:35:33,228 --> 00:35:34,176
Come on!

299
00:35:35,148 --> 00:35:37,287
Shut the dog up or I'll shoot it!

300
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:41,987
Sit!

301
00:35:42,989 --> 00:35:44,964
Sit!

302
00:35:51,502 --> 00:35:52,996
all of you!

303
00:36:08,368 --> 00:36:09,797
Radu Mircea.

304
00:36:16,912 --> 00:36:18,025
Felix Laville.

305
00:36:22,002 --> 00:36:23,147
This is filthy!

306
00:36:25,874 --> 00:36:27,368
This stamp's illegible!

307
00:36:28,082 --> 00:36:29,937
I have two stamps on my bottom.

308
00:36:30,131 --> 00:36:32,171
- What?
- I have...

309
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:33,868
What's going on?

310
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:35,594
- He's raving.
- It's true!

311
00:36:39,828 --> 00:36:41,355
Stay on this land now.

312
00:36:42,196 --> 00:36:43,308
Don't move.

313
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,195
That's an order.

314
00:36:46,965 --> 00:36:48,874
You there, come here.

315
00:36:58,614 --> 00:37:00,021
Don't act smart.

316
00:37:00,374 --> 00:37:01,781
We're watching you.

317
00:37:03,126 --> 00:37:04,206
Sit back down.

318
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,387
You're obliged to stay put.

319
00:37:46,588 --> 00:37:49,883
The whole tribe!
So no funny business, got that?

320
00:37:51,324 --> 00:37:54,259
On orders of the prefect,
horses requisitioned.

321
00:37:55,293 --> 00:37:57,432
Not our horses!

322
00:37:58,013 --> 00:38:00,053
Our horses!

323
00:38:04,413 --> 00:38:07,763
Don't let them steal our horses!

324
00:38:07,966 --> 00:38:09,210
I'll kill them.

325
00:38:09,726 --> 00:38:12,923
Calm down!
They'll only arrest you!

326
00:38:13,887 --> 00:38:16,735
You can't go back to prison.

327
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,999
Take this one.

328
00:38:23,872 --> 00:38:25,246
That one's worthless.

329
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,418
a painted old nag.

330
00:38:27,616 --> 00:38:30,137
Get the two beauties
and that black one.

331
00:38:51,171 --> 00:38:53,986
My Lords, don't take our horses!

332
00:38:54,883 --> 00:38:56,258
Hands off!

333
00:39:10,086 --> 00:39:12,322
Turn the head!

334
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:28,160
Fuck the earth!

335
00:39:54,122 --> 00:39:55,366
Fuck the water!

336
00:40:25,614 --> 00:40:27,502
My father told me,

337
00:40:27,695 --> 00:40:32,070
during a war, he and his family
hid a long time in a forest.

338
00:40:32,527 --> 00:40:33,869
When they came out,

339
00:40:34,831 --> 00:40:36,260
the war was over.

340
00:40:36,751 --> 00:40:38,377
Get lost, Taloche!

341
00:40:38,575 --> 00:40:39,590
Leave him.

342
00:40:39,791 --> 00:40:41,734
Come on, Taloche.

343
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:44,135
Taloche is a great man.

344
00:40:44,816 --> 00:40:46,671
Sit down.

345
00:40:46,864 --> 00:40:48,807
We have to leave here fast.

346
00:40:49,265 --> 00:40:51,654
We must get our family to safety.

347
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:55,593
I'll come back
to kill Pierre Pentecote.

348
00:40:55,826 --> 00:40:58,411
I'm against it.
There'll be reprisals.

349
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,705
I say we mustn't
take to the road again.

350
00:41:01,907 --> 00:41:05,519
This war isn't like the others.

351
00:41:05,714 --> 00:41:07,787
We know the way to Belgium.

352
00:41:07,987 --> 00:41:10,737
There, we'll be with our family.

353
00:41:10,931 --> 00:41:13,103
If you kill Pierre Pentecote,

354
00:41:13,299 --> 00:41:15,372
you'll bury our family.

355
00:41:16,532 --> 00:41:19,915
I agree with my uncle and my mother.

356
00:41:20,116 --> 00:41:21,775
We mustn't move from here.

357
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:09,373
Moving around is getting dangerous.
Be careful.

358
00:43:09,633 --> 00:43:12,481
- You think I'm not careful?
- Be careful anyway.

359
00:43:22,402 --> 00:43:23,330
The message?

360
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:19,045
Everything we agreed on. Bread...

361
00:44:19,817 --> 00:44:20,897
Cheese...

362
00:44:21,546 --> 00:44:22,822
Pork fat...

363
00:44:25,034 --> 00:44:26,278
and hooch.

364
00:44:27,275 --> 00:44:28,322
This is extra.

365
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:30,054
all right?

366
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:32,647
Thanks.
They'll play all night for you.

367
00:44:40,172 --> 00:44:42,408
I need everyone in the fields.

368
00:44:42,796 --> 00:44:44,683
I'll bring the truck at 5:00.

369
00:44:44,876 --> 00:44:47,364
We'll bring the children.
You have to pay them.

370
00:44:47,565 --> 00:44:49,605
We'll pay the children too.

371
00:46:03,701 --> 00:46:05,905
- Do you want some water?
- Please.

372
00:46:18,136 --> 00:46:19,063
Thank you.

373
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:23,349
- See you at the town hall tomorrow.
- See you there.

374
00:46:23,576 --> 00:46:24,983
Good-bye, Miss Lundi.

375
00:46:28,824 --> 00:46:30,418
Don't forget this.

376
00:50:18,899 --> 00:50:20,012
Tina!

377
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:31,700
What's going on?

378
00:50:32,213 --> 00:50:34,002
What is this shit?

379
00:51:01,465 --> 00:51:02,926
Goddamn it!

380
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,074
Take the cuffs off.

381
00:53:30,058 --> 00:53:31,945
Why are you doing this, Pentecote?

382
00:53:32,426 --> 00:53:34,466
Why do you lock us up like dogs?

383
00:53:36,043 --> 00:53:38,182
To rid France of her vermin.

384
00:53:55,309 --> 00:53:56,324
How many are you?

385
00:53:56,589 --> 00:53:57,483
Fifteen.

386
00:54:03,438 --> 00:54:04,518
You can go here.

387
00:54:15,183 --> 00:54:17,071
Stay here, Taloche.

388
00:54:17,488 --> 00:54:18,415
Sit down!

389
00:55:48,122 --> 00:55:49,911
Here's another blanket.

390
00:55:51,067 --> 00:55:52,823
It's going to get very cold.

391
00:56:16,253 --> 00:56:18,228
You're sure about this, Theodore?

392
00:56:18,334 --> 00:56:22,458
If my land can save a whole family,
I'm positive.

393
00:56:22,911 --> 00:56:26,326
a simple title deed
can get them out of the camp?

394
00:56:26,527 --> 00:56:28,414
I asked at the prefecture.

395
00:56:28,991 --> 00:56:32,853
Nomadic gypsies are being put in camps
all over France.

396
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,707
If they own a house,
they're allowed out.

397
00:56:37,664 --> 00:56:39,901
Seller's surname and first name?

398
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:41,372
Rosier, Theodore.

399
00:56:41,568 --> 00:56:43,357
Date and place of birth?

400
00:56:43,521 --> 00:56:46,238
October 25th, 1903, in St. amont.

401
00:56:48,226 --> 00:56:49,786
address, occupation?

402
00:56:49,986 --> 00:56:51,611
Veterinarian, St. amont town hall.

403
00:56:52,225 --> 00:56:53,338
Nationality?

404
00:56:53,537 --> 00:56:54,552
French.

405
00:56:56,546 --> 00:56:58,172
Israelite? Non-Israelite?

406
00:56:58,787 --> 00:57:00,031
Lucien, please.

407
00:57:00,835 --> 00:57:02,395
Sorry, but it's the law.

408
00:57:04,259 --> 00:57:05,437
Non-Israelite.

409
00:57:08,676 --> 00:57:10,017
OfJewish race or not?

410
00:57:11,556 --> 00:57:12,701
Non-Jewish.

411
00:57:14,628 --> 00:57:16,832
Buyer's surname and first name?

412
00:57:17,092 --> 00:57:19,198
Laville, Natasha.

413
00:57:22,501 --> 00:57:23,995
Widow of Charles Laville.

414
00:57:27,078 --> 00:57:29,151
- Nature of the sale?
- Rosier house

415
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:30,917
and its garden,

416
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:33,118
at the entrance to St. amont.

417
00:57:35,175 --> 00:57:36,736
Sale price?

418
00:57:37,063 --> 00:57:38,143
Ten francs.

419
00:57:39,463 --> 00:57:40,357
Ten francs.

420
00:57:44,552 --> 00:57:46,559
The village will be against you.

421
00:57:47,496 --> 00:57:49,155
Why are you doing this?

422
00:57:50,121 --> 00:57:51,550
To do something.

423
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,982
Just something.

424
00:57:57,033 --> 00:58:00,033
This is
my great-great-grandfather's house.

425
00:58:01,194 --> 00:58:03,529
He built the village's first house.

426
00:58:05,162 --> 00:58:06,984
My whole family was born here.

427
00:58:09,963 --> 00:58:11,588
Let me show you something.

428
00:58:28,045 --> 00:58:29,954
This is my childhood spring.

429
00:59:06,961 --> 00:59:08,554
Listen, officer.

430
00:59:08,754 --> 00:59:10,729
We've driven 50 miles.

431
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:13,069
I have the prefect's authorization,

432
00:59:13,266 --> 00:59:15,786
the Laville family's deed
to the house...

433
00:59:15,987 --> 00:59:19,599
The commander knows.
Can't you reach him?

434
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:43,404
Come with me.

435
01:00:12,953 --> 01:00:16,598
- Taloche is missing.
- Climb on the truck!

436
01:00:19,482 --> 01:00:21,271
Miss Lundi, Taloche is missing.

437
01:00:23,739 --> 01:00:26,160
- One of their relatives is missing.
- Who?

438
01:00:45,213 --> 01:00:48,410
Free! I want to be free!

439
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:09,499
Taloche!

440
01:01:15,745 --> 01:01:17,174
Get up, Taloche.

441
01:01:17,376 --> 01:01:19,231
Come on, get up.

442
01:01:23,105 --> 01:01:24,349
Hello...

443
01:01:25,186 --> 01:01:26,713
Miss Lundi.

444
01:01:27,298 --> 01:01:29,120
What did they do to you?

445
01:01:31,074 --> 01:01:32,962
I wanted to fly away...

446
01:01:33,315 --> 01:01:34,875
like a wild goose...

447
01:01:35,267 --> 01:01:38,082
to get over the barbed wire...

448
01:01:38,979 --> 01:01:39,907
Claws...

449
01:01:41,412 --> 01:01:42,273
Come on.

450
01:01:42,947 --> 01:01:43,875
Let's go.

451
01:02:12,839 --> 01:02:14,727
- We have to go.
- Climb on.

452
01:02:15,079 --> 01:02:16,028
Chavo!

453
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:17,182
Puri Dai!

454
01:02:17,384 --> 01:02:19,773
Climb on! We can't stay here.

455
01:03:39,121 --> 01:03:41,543
This is the title deed.

456
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:43,952
It proves the house is yours.

457
01:03:44,882 --> 01:03:46,671
Don't lose it or tear it up.

458
01:03:47,795 --> 01:03:51,210
There are more rooms behind this door.
I'll find the key.

459
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:53,647
You'll be fine here.
It's a sturdy house.

460
01:03:54,547 --> 01:03:56,555
I'll show you where to get water.

461
01:04:06,933 --> 01:04:08,394
are you Theodore's wife?

462
01:04:09,332 --> 01:04:10,260
No.

463
01:04:12,245 --> 01:04:14,417
I'm new to the village.

464
01:04:14,614 --> 01:04:16,272
I came here for work.

465
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:18,481
You're not from here?

466
01:04:19,766 --> 01:04:21,043
Where's your family?

467
01:04:22,390 --> 01:04:23,885
It's been broken up.

468
01:04:26,039 --> 01:04:28,341
I have two brothers in jail.

469
01:04:31,415 --> 01:04:32,757
What for?

470
01:04:35,128 --> 01:04:36,175
The war.

471
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:41,174
and you?

472
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:44,182
Do you have a husband?

473
01:04:45,369 --> 01:04:46,296
Who is he?

474
01:04:47,865 --> 01:04:51,281
I don't have a husband anymore.
I'm with my brothers.

475
01:05:03,163 --> 01:05:05,781
Great Lord, you are good.

476
01:05:05,979 --> 01:05:07,473
Go away, Satan!

477
01:05:07,676 --> 01:05:09,399
Go into the woods!

478
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:12,115
There's no room for you here!

479
01:05:13,756 --> 01:05:15,545
It will be good for us.

480
01:05:16,221 --> 01:05:17,683
Great Lord,

481
01:05:17,885 --> 01:05:19,925
you are dear to us...

482
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:36,089
Taloche, come in.

483
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,847
This is our house!

484
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,087
I don't understand.

485
01:05:40,287 --> 01:05:41,629
Why are we <i>gbdjo</i> now?

486
01:05:41,824 --> 01:05:43,929
I don't know either.

487
01:05:44,416 --> 01:05:46,326
This is our house now.

488
01:05:47,584 --> 01:05:49,340
The spirits have left.

489
01:06:08,451 --> 01:06:11,004
Darko, come with us.

490
01:06:11,108 --> 01:06:12,384
We're free!

491
01:06:12,483 --> 01:06:13,410
Free?

492
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:18,787
We'll be free if we leave here

493
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:21,347
and no one knows where we go.

494
01:07:06,505 --> 01:07:10,051
We have to make sure
that no one sees us.

495
01:07:10,474 --> 01:07:11,969
It's dangerous, Darko.

496
01:07:14,986 --> 01:07:16,710
I like your new musicians.

497
01:07:17,579 --> 01:07:19,106
They come from Italy.

498
01:07:19,627 --> 01:07:21,221
I'm glad you like them.

499
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:23,080
It's very lively.

500
01:07:58,032 --> 01:08:01,742
- Good-bye, Pierre.
- See you again, my friend.

501
01:08:09,841 --> 01:08:11,118
See you, Simonet.

502
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:52,939
Call it off!

503
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:57,653
Call it off, brother!

504
01:08:58,326 --> 01:08:59,636
He's suspicious!

505
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:05,207
MyJenisch father gave me life

506
01:09:05,399 --> 01:09:06,861
with your Rom mother.

507
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:10,678
I don't deserve
to beJenisch anymore!

508
01:09:10,872 --> 01:09:12,563
My brother...

509
01:09:40,796 --> 01:09:44,058
Since we left the camp
where our brothers are held,

510
01:09:44,284 --> 01:09:46,324
you no longer have a life.

511
01:09:56,189 --> 01:09:57,433
Cali!

512
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:01,688
Cali!

513
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:05,882
Chouroro! Food!

514
01:10:13,408 --> 01:10:16,704
Chouroro has brought us food!

515
01:10:26,177 --> 01:10:27,421
Where's the nosh?

516
01:10:29,697 --> 01:10:30,646
I have the key!

517
01:10:31,009 --> 01:10:33,082
- What key?
- The key to the house.

518
01:10:35,362 --> 01:10:37,118
- I don't have food.
- Here.

519
01:10:40,739 --> 01:10:41,437
Thank you.

520
01:10:41,635 --> 01:10:42,780
Taloche!

521
01:10:43,715 --> 01:10:45,210
Get the lamp!

522
01:11:23,944 --> 01:11:24,893
Ghosts!

523
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,200
Ghosts!

524
01:11:27,816 --> 01:11:29,704
There are loads of ghosts in there!

525
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:41,061
It's packed with ghosts.

526
01:11:41,258 --> 01:11:42,468
Packed with ghosts!

527
01:11:44,330 --> 01:11:46,240
Why is he nailing the door shut?

528
01:11:46,442 --> 01:11:47,751
It's full of mice.

529
01:11:47,947 --> 01:11:49,670
They're rats. It's normal.

530
01:11:50,186 --> 01:11:52,608
Every house has them.
They're not mice.

531
01:11:52,811 --> 01:11:55,331
<i>Mulos</i> aren't rats!
They're our ghosts!

532
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:03,973
It's beautiful!

533
01:12:04,173 --> 01:12:05,318
a big house!

534
01:12:07,468 --> 01:12:09,062
This is Theodore's room.

535
01:12:09,261 --> 01:12:10,538
This is his office.

536
01:12:10,957 --> 01:12:12,070
The heating.

537
01:12:13,389 --> 01:12:14,120
The kitchen.

538
01:12:23,983 --> 01:12:26,569
I sleep here. It's big.

539
01:13:08,468 --> 01:13:10,377
Free the water!

540
01:13:32,439 --> 01:13:36,334
<i>Marshal, here we are</i>

541
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:40,757
<i>Before you, savior of France</i>

542
01:13:40,951 --> 01:13:44,530
<i>We swear, bs your children, </i>

543
01:13:44,856 --> 01:13:48,533
<i>To serve you and follow your step</i>

544
01:13:48,857 --> 01:13:52,752
<i>Marshal, here we are</i>

545
01:13:52,953 --> 01:13:57,078
<i>You have given us new hope</i>

546
01:13:57,273 --> 01:14:00,852
<i>The Fatherland will rise again</i>

547
01:14:01,178 --> 01:14:05,040
<i>Marshal, Marshal, here we are</i>

548
01:15:03,521 --> 01:15:04,601
Children...

549
01:15:05,410 --> 01:15:06,358
Sit down.

550
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:29,668
Get out your exercise books.
We'll do sums.

551
01:15:39,205 --> 01:15:42,108
Miss Lundi!

552
01:15:48,775 --> 01:15:51,459
My <i>gbdji!</i>

553
01:15:53,479 --> 01:15:55,618
Thank you, Changalo, thank you.

554
01:15:56,712 --> 01:15:57,922
We'll pay you for it.

555
01:15:58,792 --> 01:16:01,476
Changalo!
What does <i>gbdjo</i> Lebel want?

556
01:16:03,272 --> 01:16:06,535
We have to play for their hens
to make them lay.

557
01:16:06,729 --> 01:16:10,112
If they pay,
we'll do what they want.

558
01:16:11,849 --> 01:16:14,981
Come on, Taloche, we have work to do.

559
01:16:15,177 --> 01:16:17,087
We're going to play.

560
01:16:17,290 --> 01:16:19,527
What's wrong? are you sick?

561
01:16:20,202 --> 01:16:23,367
Come on!
We're going to play for the hens.

562
01:17:23,058 --> 01:17:26,473
Set foot on my land
and I'll smash your face in!

563
01:17:32,243 --> 01:17:33,257
Hands off our animals!

564
01:17:37,203 --> 01:17:37,999
Hands off our animals!

565
01:17:39,028 --> 01:17:40,588
- Hands off!
- Get off our land!

566
01:17:40,788 --> 01:17:42,446
The land's ours! It's ours!

567
01:17:43,604 --> 01:17:44,749
Our horses!

568
01:17:45,748 --> 01:17:47,985
He's going to curse the mule!

569
01:17:51,605 --> 01:17:54,573
We don't want your ugly mugs
as neighbors!

570
01:17:55,189 --> 01:17:57,710
My ugly mug
is better than your dirty ass,

571
01:17:58,550 --> 01:17:59,532
you damn hick!

572
01:18:02,391 --> 01:18:05,490
I'll smash your gypsy head in!

573
01:18:05,686 --> 01:18:09,648
Get out of our village!

574
01:18:09,943 --> 01:18:12,278
You're not throwing that!
Put it down!

575
01:18:13,912 --> 01:18:16,301
Go home, before this gets worse!

576
01:18:16,504 --> 01:18:19,254
We don't want
a gang of thieves around here!

577
01:18:19,448 --> 01:18:20,430
Calm down!

578
01:18:21,433 --> 01:18:23,505
Calm down!

579
01:18:30,297 --> 01:18:31,541
I'll kill them!

580
01:18:34,587 --> 01:18:37,554
Stop! I told you to stop!

581
01:18:40,699 --> 01:18:41,331
Stop it!

582
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:48,693
Don't do that!

583
01:18:49,340 --> 01:18:50,234
Shit!

584
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:53,111
Stop!

585
01:18:53,308 --> 01:18:54,737
- You'll regret it!
- You crook!

586
01:18:58,365 --> 01:19:01,115
My grandfather's field
is the Lavilles' now!

587
01:19:02,461 --> 01:19:05,942
- They're not French!
- Half this land has always been ours.

588
01:19:06,429 --> 01:19:08,885
The solicitor says it's the Lavilles'.

589
01:19:09,086 --> 01:19:11,356
Now get lost or I'll beat you up!

590
01:19:12,702 --> 01:19:13,848
Get lost!

591
01:19:19,327 --> 01:19:21,662
Lise, why are you out this late?

592
01:19:22,047 --> 01:19:24,022
I went to get water from the well.

593
01:19:24,384 --> 01:19:26,294
The door confused me.

594
01:19:27,008 --> 01:19:28,863
I thought the handle was outside.

595
01:19:29,536 --> 01:19:30,944
I'll get the other key.

596
01:19:31,136 --> 01:19:32,413
I'll fetch it for you.

597
01:20:23,335 --> 01:20:24,710
I have to mend this door.

598
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:36,546
Put it there.
I'll take it tomorrow.

599
01:22:01,811 --> 01:22:02,825
Sit down.

600
01:22:05,331 --> 01:22:06,760
You work at the town hall?

601
01:22:09,203 --> 01:22:10,730
I'm the schoolteacher.

602
01:22:11,604 --> 01:22:13,392
and the town hall secretary.

603
01:22:14,196 --> 01:22:15,276
You live upstairs?

604
01:22:17,716 --> 01:22:18,644
Yes.

605
01:22:19,764 --> 01:22:21,226
Go up, we'll follow you.

606
01:22:39,574 --> 01:22:40,589
Sit down!

607
01:22:42,455 --> 01:22:43,382
Sit!

608
01:22:51,224 --> 01:22:52,086
Calm down!

609
01:23:01,242 --> 01:23:02,169
Sit down.

610
01:23:23,484 --> 01:23:24,377
Here.

611
01:23:25,276 --> 01:23:27,164
My bag, my purse...

612
01:24:15,778 --> 01:24:19,008
You claim you love order,
yet you come and terrify the children!

613
01:24:19,299 --> 01:24:20,543
Shut your mouth!

614
01:24:20,738 --> 01:24:22,527
This is a school.

615
01:24:22,723 --> 01:24:24,862
I'm the mayor
and I answer for Miss Lundi!

616
01:24:25,059 --> 01:24:26,270
Of course.

617
01:24:27,459 --> 01:24:29,467
Who issued this identity card?

618
01:24:30,404 --> 01:24:32,346
We know who you are.

619
01:24:35,364 --> 01:24:36,412
Come with us.

620
01:25:50,734 --> 01:25:52,556
Otto!

621
01:26:08,879 --> 01:26:09,828
Talk!

622
01:26:10,224 --> 01:26:12,679
Who's the head of your network?

623
01:27:00,437 --> 01:27:01,550
Young Claude!

624
01:27:09,942 --> 01:27:10,870
Young Claude!

625
01:27:56,348 --> 01:27:58,999
- Puri Dai, you have the key?
- No.

626
01:28:00,989 --> 01:28:01,883
Taloche!

627
01:28:02,205 --> 01:28:04,725
any idea where the trunk key is?

628
01:28:07,293 --> 01:28:09,366
May bitterness rot the key.

629
01:28:11,325 --> 01:28:14,293
- Does anyone know where the key is?
- No.

630
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:38,455
Taloche...

631
01:28:46,210 --> 01:28:47,039
What?

632
01:28:47,714 --> 01:28:49,056
My legs hurt.

633
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:50,396
We'll take a walk.

634
01:28:50,914 --> 01:28:52,922
Come on, Chouroro! Let's go.

635
01:28:54,018 --> 01:28:56,320
- Come on, walk.
- I can't feel my feet.

636
01:28:56,515 --> 01:28:58,817
Move your arms. Move your legs.

637
01:28:59,012 --> 01:29:00,768
I have pins and needles.

638
01:29:03,076 --> 01:29:04,090
Go on, walk.

639
01:29:10,213 --> 01:29:11,806
Go on, Chouroro.

640
01:29:14,341 --> 01:29:17,407
Look! Walk!

641
01:29:17,702 --> 01:29:18,563
Come on!

642
01:29:20,006 --> 01:29:21,762
Hide!

643
01:29:23,975 --> 01:29:26,692
- What are you doing here?
- Taking a walk.

644
01:29:26,887 --> 01:29:28,480
Chouroro, you followed us.

645
01:29:28,775 --> 01:29:29,724
You're mad!

646
01:29:30,375 --> 01:29:32,099
You hid him?

647
01:29:33,863 --> 01:29:35,686
Listen, Chouroro.

648
01:29:36,263 --> 01:29:37,725
We can't keep you here.

649
01:29:38,408 --> 01:29:40,896
We like you,
but you're not one of us.

650
01:29:41,096 --> 01:29:42,820
Leave him! He's mine.

651
01:29:43,336 --> 01:29:45,758
Chouroro's my brother!

652
01:29:47,049 --> 01:29:48,642
Walk. Come on.

653
01:30:20,845 --> 01:30:22,732
Keep away from us, Chouroro!

654
01:30:25,358 --> 01:30:28,009
If someone comes,
say you're not with us.

655
01:30:29,646 --> 01:30:31,206
I want to stay with you!

656
01:31:10,899 --> 01:31:13,168
Why's he sticking to us like this?

657
01:31:15,444 --> 01:31:16,818
He wants to be a gypsy.

658
01:31:17,012 --> 01:31:19,052
Come on, push, Taloche!

659
01:31:20,884 --> 01:31:23,088
Gypsy? That's not a trade!

660
01:31:23,285 --> 01:31:24,779
Come on, Taloche!

661
01:31:41,782 --> 01:31:43,408
Taloche! You're killing me!

662
01:31:46,455 --> 01:31:47,567
Come on, we'll push.

663
01:31:49,399 --> 01:31:51,342
Push! Push with us!

664
01:34:30,538 --> 01:34:31,967
Wake up!

665
01:34:32,171 --> 01:34:33,218
Come out of there!

666
01:34:33,419 --> 01:34:34,596
Get your passbooks!

667
01:34:35,179 --> 01:34:36,837
Come out now! Let's move!

668
01:34:40,652 --> 01:34:43,140
- Get your passbooks.
- Get up!

669
01:34:43,916 --> 01:34:45,825
Come on, hurry it up!

670
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:48,395
Hurry it up! Get your passbooks!

671
01:34:48,588 --> 01:34:49,701
Come here, you!

672
01:34:50,157 --> 01:34:51,466
Come on, get out.

673
01:34:55,277 --> 01:34:56,837
What is it? We've done nothing.

674
01:34:57,038 --> 01:34:58,216
Move!

675
01:34:59,629 --> 01:35:00,425
Move!

676
01:35:03,822 --> 01:35:06,310
Hurry up!
Get in line with the others!

677
01:35:06,510 --> 01:35:08,714
Get over there!

678
01:35:09,230 --> 01:35:11,271
- Come on!
- Step back!

679
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:15,727
Hand over the passbooks.

680
01:35:16,559 --> 01:35:18,054
Hand it over.

681
01:35:28,273 --> 01:35:30,793
The stamps?
Where are the stamps?

682
01:35:31,346 --> 01:35:32,840
We arrived last night.

683
01:35:34,193 --> 01:35:35,917
The town hall was closed.

684
01:35:39,186 --> 01:35:40,396
Sure...

685
01:35:52,179 --> 01:35:54,002
Where's this one?
Calo! Who is he?

686
01:35:54,644 --> 01:35:56,205
answer me!

687
01:36:26,968 --> 01:36:29,390
- are they all here?
- Yes, the whole tribe.

688
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:31,124
Take them away.

689
01:36:31,225 --> 01:36:32,632
No stamps.

690
01:36:33,145 --> 01:36:35,698
Your passbooks aren't in order!

691
01:36:35,897 --> 01:36:37,806
We'll run checks on you all.

692
01:36:38,009 --> 01:36:39,569
Get in line!

693
01:36:40,889 --> 01:36:43,410
Move in single file!

694
01:36:45,210 --> 01:36:46,672
We can't leave the vans!

695
01:36:47,130 --> 01:36:48,821
The horses!

696
01:36:49,626 --> 01:36:52,277
Over here! There's one hidden here!

697
01:36:52,475 --> 01:36:53,555
Get out of there!

698
01:36:55,995 --> 01:36:57,904
We can't leave our animals!

699
01:36:58,108 --> 01:36:59,537
We'll take care of them.

700
01:37:00,380 --> 01:37:02,104
Don't worry, you'll be back.

701
01:37:05,052 --> 01:37:06,034
Gendarme!

702
01:37:08,317 --> 01:37:09,811
This boy isn't with us.

703
01:37:10,077 --> 01:37:11,899
Take him back to St. amont.

704
01:37:12,414 --> 01:37:14,934
If he's not yours, whose is he?

705
01:37:15,134 --> 01:37:16,694
He hid in our van.

706
01:37:16,894 --> 01:37:18,138
He followed us.

707
01:37:18,494 --> 01:37:21,309
Tell them!
Tell them you followed us.

708
01:37:25,470 --> 01:37:28,820
You'll be back. Don't try to fool us.
That's enough.

709
01:37:29,023 --> 01:37:30,103
He followed us!

710
01:37:30,303 --> 01:37:31,415
Move it!

711
01:37:33,695 --> 01:37:35,670
Let go! Follow the others!

712
01:37:35,904 --> 01:37:38,271
Let go! Follow the others!

713
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:39,863
Let go!

714
01:37:40,961 --> 01:37:42,106
Let go of it!

715
01:37:42,977 --> 01:37:44,603
Let go, dammit!

716
01:37:50,306 --> 01:37:52,695
Get up. Go with the others!

717
01:37:59,395 --> 01:38:00,475
Stop him!

718
01:38:07,268 --> 01:38:09,406
Don't move!

719
01:39:38,990 --> 01:39:39,918
Taloche!

720
01:41:34,044 --> 01:41:38,103
<i>Good luck, all you others!</i>

721
01:41:49,437 --> 01:41:53,628
<i>If anyone worries about our absence</i>

722
01:41:53,822 --> 01:41:57,467
<i>Tell him we have been thrown out</i>

723
01:41:57,822 --> 01:42:01,532
<i>From the sky and the light</i>

724
01:42:01,727 --> 01:42:04,761
<i>We the lords of this vast universe... </i>

725
01:42:05,471 --> 01:42:10,229
The gypsy family that inspired this film
was interned in Mechelen, Belgium,

726
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:15,386
before being deported to auschwitz
by convoy Z on January 15, 1944.

727
01:42:15,841 --> 01:42:19,769

the Resistance fighter Yvette Lundy

728
01:42:19,969 --> 01:42:23,133
who was deported
to Ravensbruck and freed in 1945.

729
01:42:23,522 --> 01:42:27,297
Of the 2 million gypsies
living in Europe before the war,

730
