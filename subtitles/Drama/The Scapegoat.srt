- Good afternoon.

- Is that it?
- That's it right enough, miss.

Well, I can't say I've ever heard it called that before.
Stand back, now.

No, it's not true, Fenton.
Tuck that shirt in, please.

11
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,420
So why are you leaving
before the end of term, sir?

12
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,059
That is for me and the headmaster to know
and for you to wonder at, Smith.

13
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,660
- Well, there's definitely no more Greek.
- Correct, Johnson, there is no more Greek.

14
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,459
The headmaster, in his wisdom,
has decided there are more useful subjects.

- Where do people usually put it?

18
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:44,699
- It would normally go in the sitting room.
- That's not entirely helpful in a house like this.

Let's put it in the drawing room for now.
This way.

21

Is it easy to work?

22
00:01:55,962 --> 00:01:59,223
I would suggest that I discuss
the technical details with Mr Spence.

but Major Hulton has a young family.

is a more practical subject for the boys.

- It's all I need.

- So, a walking tour?
- Yes. Thought I'd see a bit of the world, what's left of it.

35
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,899
- I've always wanted to visit...
- Quite.

36
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,219
- The romance of the road and all that.
- Yes.

Are you sure I can't
call you a taxi?

38

Er...no. Thank you. I thought I'd start
as I mean to go on. My train isn't till six.

Well, you can hardly blame

That is incredible, don't you think?

00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,099
I mean, who the hell are you?

Er...John. John Standing.
Who are you?

Er... Johnny Spence.

Pleased to meet...
No, completely astonished to meet you.

You got time for a quick one?
Come on, my shout.

62
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,125
We'll probably discover we've got
dozens of cousins in common.

63
00:06:01,148 --> 00:06:03,403
- Do you have many cousins?
- No, not really.

64
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,620
I have a herd of them. Don't get on
with a single one. Scroungers, the lot.

65
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,300
- Thank you. That's for you.
- Thank you, Mr Spence.

66
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,739
This should keep us going.

You're not rich by any chance,
are you?

00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,900
Er... no, not at all.

69
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:24,019
I was in a brothel once in Paris.
Had a set of twins that cost 1,000 francs an hour.

70
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:29,220
I don't think we're quite in that league yet. Circus,
maybe, cabaret. What do you think? Cheers, anyway.

71
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,179
- So, where are you from?
- Wales.

72
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,219
Mmm...

73
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,659
- Father?
- Dead now. Worked down the mines all his life.

Oh, you don't sound like a Taff.

75
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,059
My dad wanted me to go to university.
It was his dream.

76
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,337
I went up before the war,
got my degree

77
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,075
and came back talking like a bishop,
as he used to say.

78
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,671
Well, then, we're definitely not related.
I can't remember passing an exam in my life.

79
00:06:48,683 --> 00:06:50,045
- Smoke?
- Thank you.

80
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,819
- So, what about family? Married?
- No. No, I'm not.

81
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,859
You must have some relations?

82
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,020
- Just a maiden aunt in Fishguard.
- Mmm.

83
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,179
- You lucky dog.
- You haven't met her.

84
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,460
What I wouldn't give to be in your position.
To your freedom. Long may it last.

85
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,259
- Is there enough?
- There's plenty.

86
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,916
But there's still no word from him?

87
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:35,660
- No.
- Something's happened. I know it.

88
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,539
This'll stop you worrying.

89
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,019
- Mrs Paul thinks that he's missed the train.
- Oh, what would she know?

90
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,820
Nobody in this house
understands my son except me.

91

Johnny doesn't like to fail.

92
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,579
They're happy about the booze...
as long as we drink out of these.

93
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:06,659
I've spoken to the kitchen. Ordered two large steaks,
very well done, mashed potato and gravy.

94
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,699
- Cheers.

Mmm... So, a walking tour?

96
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:16,139
- The open road is your oyster and all that?
- Yes. I have a few ideas. How about you?

97
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,859
Oh, a funk, a complete funk.
Had a bugger of a day in town.

98
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,099
I was on the train on the way back,
and I thought,

99
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,179
"What the hell am I doing, going home like
a lamb to the slaughter?" so off I got.

100
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,763
Here I am.

101
00:08:26,787 --> 00:08:29,840
What about your family?
Won't they be worried?

102
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,099
About me? Never.
About themselves, definitely.

it's never enough, is it? No-one's ever satisfied.

106

- It doesn't take much to satisfy me.
- Well, you're lucky. The world's your playground.

107

Mine hangs round my neck
like a rope.

yourself without being carted off to the funny farm.

and the coronation of the next?

Give me the pieces
and I'll tell him it was me.

Then he'll be cross with you.

I think there's a place in town
where we can get it mended,

Of course Plato believed that
every man was split in half

00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:53,359
by Zeus so he couldn't
compete with the gods,

a twin somewhere in the world.

I have to go to the station.

are at the pub. We left them there.

Thank you. That's mine.
That's his.

- I can't wear this.
- Of course you can.

I haven't worn one of these
since I was ten.

Look at that, perfect fit.
Could have been made for you.

138

about the gods?

00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:19,099
But now we just have to wait.
I can't give the authorisation without him.

151
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,100
You know what my brother's like.

152
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,660
(GROANS)

153
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,219
It's ridiculous, this rule about not
having a fire in the morning.

154
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,779
Why economise on wood
when we live in a forest?

155
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,939
Perhaps you'd have a word
with Charlotte?

156
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,179
And have her give me one of her looks?
No thank you.

157
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,219
Anyway, it's your responsibility.

158
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,379
- I've had some fresh toast made for you, Miss Spence.
- Thank you, Charlotte.

159
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:02,139
Mr Spence has just telephoned from a
public house in Peterborough.

160
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,299
- What's he doing there?
- It's a bit early, even for Johnny.

161
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,539
He had to stay the night there.
He was feeling indisposed.

162
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,779
Did he say anything
about the contract?

163
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,780
No.

164
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,460
Will that be all, Mrs Spence?

165
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,900
Er... yes, Charlotte. Thank you.

166
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,179
He won't be back for hours now.
Inconsiderate bastard.

167
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,180
(KNOCK AT THE DOOR)

168
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,779
Who is... Who is it?

169
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,539
It's me, sir. George.

170
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,540
Oh, my God...

171
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,140
I'm... I'm sorry, who is it?

172
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,740
Could you please open the door, sir?

173
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,980
It's locked.

174
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,300
Perhaps you might consider
unlocking it, sir.

175
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,420
No, it...

176
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,900
(THUD)

177
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,700
Um... I...

178
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,899
- I think you must have the wrong room.
- We'll have you out of here in a jiffy, sir.

179
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,854
- Let me help you get dressed.
- What?

180
00:13:09,866 --> 00:13:13,529
No thank you.
I'm quite capable of dressing myself.

181
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,539
Please? I'll be quite all right.

182
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,860
- Shall I get you some coffee, then, sir?
- No.

183
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:25,019
I'm so sorry. That was um... That was very rude.
I just need to find my things.

184
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,020
I understand, sir.

185
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,939
- I'm sorry. Someone seems to have stolen my clothes.
- I made you one of my specials.

186
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:06,820
- Right, um... I think I should...
- Back in one, sir. Always the best way.

187
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,619
(GASPS)
That's very good.

188
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,699
What is it... was it?

189
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,539
- Vodka mainly, sir. Just how you like it.
- Thank you.

190
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,379
You should get the landlord up here.
I need to sort this out.

191
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,419
Don't worry, sir. I've had a word,
and his discretion is assured.

192
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,420
Fine. I'll do it myself.

193
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:40,419
Ah, just the man. Look... The fellow
I met last night has run off with all my things.

194
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,947
- I can't find my wallet...
- Don't worry, sir.

195
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:45,084
You settled everything
very generously last night.

196
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,619
No, no.
The man who paid last night wasn't me.

197
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,619
- I mean, we swapped coats, but...
- Don't upset yourself, Mr Spence.

198
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,059
I'm... I'm not upset,
and I'm not Mr Spence.

199
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,899
- I'll just put your things in the car, Mr Spence.
- No!

200
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,059
Er... put them wherever you want.
They're not my things.

201
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,299
Wait here.
Look, I'm not who you think I am.

202
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,459
Look, you can ask me any question you want.
I wouldn't know the answer.

203
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,580
I don't even know who you are.
Don't...

204
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,420
My God...

205
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,020
That's a Silver Wraith.

206
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,580
That's incredible.

207
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,939
Four-speed transmission,
coachwork by Hooper. Am I right?

208
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,940
It's beautiful.

209
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,660
Are you intending to drive, sir?

210
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,900
- Could I?
- Of course.

211
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,940
If you want to.

212
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,899
(METAL GRINDING)

213
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,379
Oh, my God! I'm...
I'm so sorry! I didn't...

214
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,740
Perhaps it would be better
if I drove, sir.

215
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,739
I'm... I did... I didn't see...

216
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:09,979
Oh, my Goodness! I'll...
I'll pay for the damage of course. I'm...

217
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,299
- All will be all right once we get you back, sir.
- I'm so sorry.

218
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,739
- We'll be home before you know it.
- Yes. Er...

219
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,740
I'm...

220
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:10,347
- Johnny! Johnny!
- Sorry?

221
00:17:10,348 --> 00:17:14,187
I haven't got time to talk. It's the Williamson dinner at six.
One of us has to be there.

222
00:17:14,188 --> 00:17:17,507
- What the devil's happened to the car, George?
- Entirely my fault, sir.

223
00:17:17,508 --> 00:17:19,508
Well, it can come out of your wages.

224
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,627
Come on! I've got to go!

225
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:26,628
Would you please stop shouting?

226
00:17:27,228 --> 00:17:30,387
It wasn't George's fault. It was mine.
I'll pay for the damage.

227
00:17:30,388 --> 00:17:32,388
I haven't got time for this.

228
00:17:51,268 --> 00:17:53,268
I'll take your bag upstairs, sir.

229
00:17:54,228 --> 00:17:56,228
Thank you.

230
00:18:38,588 --> 00:18:40,627
Daddy! You're back!

231
00:18:40,628 --> 00:18:42,667
I've missed you so much!

232
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:45,228
I have terrible news.

233
00:18:46,628 --> 00:18:48,628
Mrs Simpson is dead.

234
00:18:49,388 --> 00:18:51,388
Mrs Simpson is dead?

235
00:18:52,268 --> 00:18:54,307
That... that is terrible news.

236
00:18:54,308 --> 00:18:57,627
- You don't look very upset.
- No, no, I am. I am.

237
00:18:57,628 --> 00:18:59,667
I didn't even know she was ill.

238
00:18:59,668 --> 00:19:01,988
Would you come up and see her
after my bath?

239
00:19:03,628 --> 00:19:05,667
- You mean she's here?
- Of course.

240
00:19:05,668 --> 00:19:09,148
I told Father McReady he couldn't bury her
until you came back.

241
00:19:10,068 --> 00:19:12,548
You just have to promise that
you'll come up.

242
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:15,028
I promise.

243
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:24,067
Yes, it's him.

244
00:19:24,068 --> 00:19:26,068
Darling?

245
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:29,627
- God, you look a mess. Where have you been?
- He really was ill.

246
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:32,547
You might at least apologise.
We've been waiting all day for you.

247
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:34,987
- I was so worried.
- Aren't you going to kiss either of us?

248
00:19:34,988 --> 00:19:37,147
Look... Um...
there's been a mistake.

249
00:19:37,148 --> 00:19:43,467
I met whoever you think I am last night
and we had a few drinks... too many, I'm afraid,

250
00:19:43,468 --> 00:19:49,108
and then, this morning, when I woke up,
he had stolen my clothes and my luggage

251
00:19:49,868 --> 00:19:53,129
and my wallet,
and taken off without any explanation.

252
00:19:53,148 --> 00:19:57,148
Anyway, I came here this afternoon
to find out exactly what was going on.

253

(SIGHS)

254
00:19:59,228 --> 00:20:01,347
He's been drinking.
I can smell it from here.

255
00:20:01,348 --> 00:20:04,387
- I'm going up to change for dinner. Come on, Frances.
- Pl...

256
00:20:04,388 --> 00:20:07,747
Did you talk to Paul?
He's been in a state all day about the contract.

257
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,587
- Is he the one who was just rude to me?
- It's not funny!

258
00:20:10,588 --> 00:20:12,588
You might at least have telephoned.

259
00:20:16,988 --> 00:20:21,307
There you are, Mr Spence. Her Ladyship has
asked me to send you up the moment you arrive.

260
00:20:21,308 --> 00:20:23,467
- I'm not Mr...
- Please don't keep her waiting.

261
00:20:23,468 --> 00:20:26,868
We were expecting you yesterday
and she's getting quite anxious.

262
00:20:35,268 --> 00:20:37,307
Was there anything else you wanted?

263
00:20:37,308 --> 00:20:39,308
No, no. Nothing at all.

264
00:20:41,348 --> 00:20:43,348
I am, of course, going upstairs.

265

- Oh, my God!

00:21:24,148 --> 00:21:26,387
- What are you doing? Are you mad?
- I'm...

269

Annie's just getting me some shampoo.
She'll be back in a minute.

You are an idiot.
Mmm...

271
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,180
Come and find me after dinner.

272
00:21:41,203 --> 00:21:43,547
Paul won't be back till late.
I've made sure of that.

(KNOCKING)

274
00:21:46,068 --> 00:21:49,787
Annie, dear, can you come and help me?
I want it properly rubbed in.

275
00:21:49,788 --> 00:21:51,788
Yes, madam.

276
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:03,788
You disgust me!

277
00:22:16,748 --> 00:22:20,348
Her Ladyship was most insistent on
seeing you immediately, sir.

278
00:22:21,668 --> 00:22:23,948
- Right.
- She's expecting you for supper.

279
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:31,068
Why don't I take this from you,
and you lead the way?

280
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,108
Shall I?

281
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:52,068
You beastly boy.

282
00:22:53,988 --> 00:22:55,988
Come and give your mother a kiss.

283
00:23:01,227 --> 00:23:04,057
Father McReady, would you think me
rude if I cut short our little game

284
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,947
so I can talk to my prodigal here?

285
00:23:06,948 --> 00:23:09,668
- No, of course not, Your Ladyship.
- What's the tally now?

286
00:23:09,691 --> 00:23:12,087
I think I owe you 2/4 pence,
Your Ladyship.

287
00:23:12,108 --> 00:23:14,563
How very thrilling.
We must make a note of that so we don't forget.

288
00:23:14,574 --> 00:23:16,254
Where's my little book?

289
00:23:16,277 --> 00:23:19,468
Well, I'm sure you and Johnny
have a great deal to discuss.

290
00:23:20,668 --> 00:23:23,548
- <i>In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti</i>.
- Amen.

291
00:23:24,588 --> 00:23:26,588
Good to have you safe home, Johnny.

292
00:23:27,228 --> 00:23:29,228
- Enjoy your dinner.
- Thank you.

Now, come and sit beside me.

What's the matter?
You look ill.

295
00:23:41,108 --> 00:23:43,147
What have you done with your tie?

296
00:23:43,148 --> 00:23:45,668
- I'm sorry, I'm feeling a little...
- Hungover.

297
00:23:46,628 --> 00:23:48,667
Serves you right.

298
00:23:48,668 --> 00:23:52,227
I suppose you found some little tart
to amuse yourself with last night,

299
00:23:52,228 --> 00:23:55,388
though goodness knows why you had to
go to Peterborough to find one.

300
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,388
So, did you settle with
the Levertons?

Did you agree the new contract?

302
00:24:02,628 --> 00:24:05,828
Don't play the fool with me, Johnny.
Did you or didn't you?

303
00:24:07,628 --> 00:24:09,667
Yes, I did.

304
00:24:09,668 --> 00:24:12,707
Good.
Oh, I knew you could manage it.

305
00:24:12,728 --> 00:24:14,912
Paul is such a baby.

306
00:24:14,935 --> 00:24:18,548
I knew that if you talked to them,
you'd make them see it our way.

307
00:24:19,228 --> 00:24:21,267
You're a Spence.

308
00:24:21,268 --> 00:24:24,068
The only one in this house,
as far as I'm concerned.

309
00:24:24,508 --> 00:24:26,508
Ah... where's my present?

310
00:24:29,348 --> 00:24:32,787
Johnny, I'm not in the mood.
I need it. We expected you yesterday.

311
00:24:32,788 --> 00:24:33,827
(KNOCKING)

312
00:24:33,828 --> 00:24:35,867
That'll be Annie, ma'am.

313
00:24:35,868 --> 00:24:37,868
I trust you haven't let me down.

314
00:24:40,628 --> 00:24:42,908
Now, tell us what's happening
in London.

315
00:24:43,788 --> 00:24:45,788
Who did you see?
What's the gossip?

316
00:24:46,988 --> 00:24:49,427
I don't see why you're acting
so surprised.

317
00:24:49,428 --> 00:24:51,787
When has he ever behaved
any differently?

318
00:24:51,788 --> 00:24:54,908
- Perhaps he really was ill.
- Oh, don't be so bloody naive!

319
00:24:55,748 --> 00:24:58,068
Well, I think I'll go up
and leave you to it.

320
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:03,228
Tell Charlotte, if you ever see her again,
that I won't be needing anything else.

321
00:25:03,828 --> 00:25:05,828
Good night.

322
00:25:07,748 --> 00:25:09,867
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right. I'm fine.

323
00:25:09,868 --> 00:25:14,547
You have to stand up to my brother,
otherwise he just takes advantage.

324
00:25:14,548 --> 00:25:16,548
Yes, I know.

325
00:25:19,828 --> 00:25:21,828
I think I'll go up too.

326
00:25:24,948 --> 00:25:26,948
Good night.

327
00:25:37,388 --> 00:25:39,388
Good night.

328
00:25:44,908 --> 00:25:46,908
Do you have it?

329
00:25:49,828 --> 00:25:51,828
Her present.

330
00:25:54,588 --> 00:25:56,588
Shall we get it?

331
00:26:13,108 --> 00:26:15,108
That'll be the one.

332
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,628
Nearly ran out.
We were expecting you yesterday.

333
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:24,948
Is that all you got?

334
00:26:25,868 --> 00:26:27,908
It's not going to last very long.

335
00:26:56,508 --> 00:26:58,548
(SOBS)

336
00:27:16,628 --> 00:27:18,667
(SCREAMS)
Oh! You gave me a fright!

337
00:27:18,668 --> 00:27:21,387
- I'm... I'm so sorry.
- Standing in the dark, I thought...

338
00:27:21,388 --> 00:27:24,440
- I'm sorry. It's entirely my fault.
- No, I shouldn't have barged in.

339
00:27:24,463 --> 00:27:28,108
I thought you were with your mother.
I'm sorry.

340
00:27:37,028 --> 00:27:39,028
Could you undo me?

341
00:27:43,668 --> 00:27:45,668
Please?

342
00:27:55,468 --> 00:27:57,468
I was so worried.

343
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,748
I thought something
must have happened.

344
00:28:04,988 --> 00:28:06,988
Did it?

345
00:28:07,668 --> 00:28:10,548
- Did... Did what?
- Something happen?

346
00:28:12,388 --> 00:28:17,147
- No.
- Oh.

347
00:28:17,148 --> 00:28:19,148
Good.

348
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:22,708
Thank you.

349
00:28:28,508 --> 00:28:30,587
- Did you speak to Piglet?
- Who?

350
00:28:30,588 --> 00:28:32,588
She was waiting up for you.

351
00:28:34,708 --> 00:28:36,708
You all right?
You're very quiet.

352
00:28:37,708 --> 00:28:40,347
Would you like me to run you a bath?
You must be exhausted.

353
00:28:40,348 --> 00:28:42,387
No.

354
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:44,388
No. Thank you.

355
00:28:45,508 --> 00:28:48,788
- How... How are you?
- All right, I suppose.

356
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:53,148
Charlotte is being beastly to everyone.
It seems to be my fault.

357
00:28:54,388 --> 00:28:56,708
I don't see Piglet
from one day to the next.

358
00:28:57,668 --> 00:28:59,668
She leads a completely secret life.

359
00:29:01,188 --> 00:29:03,347
Did you say anything to her
by the way?

360
00:29:03,348 --> 00:29:06,348
She's been acting particularly oddly
since you left.

361
00:29:07,828 --> 00:29:09,907
What about you?

362
00:29:09,908 --> 00:29:12,308
How was it?
The business with the contract.

363
00:29:13,108 --> 00:29:15,308
Oh, um...
let's not talk about that now.

364
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:18,027
Of course.

365
00:29:18,028 --> 00:29:21,827
I'll be done in a minute.
I know I'm going on and you hate that.

366
00:29:21,828 --> 00:29:23,496
- Darling, I...
- What?

367
00:29:23,508 --> 00:29:24,647
What?

368
00:29:25,188 --> 00:29:27,228
No, it's nothing.

369
00:29:27,628 --> 00:29:29,628
You said darling.

370
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:34,228
I'm being silly.
Ignore me. Sorry.

371
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:38,467
I think I'll pop out for a while.
I'm not very tired.

372
00:29:38,468 --> 00:29:40,508
Do you have to?

373
00:29:41,468 --> 00:29:43,508
Yes.

374
00:29:53,268 --> 00:29:56,747
- What the hell are you doing?!
- I'm just popping out for some air.

375
00:29:56,748 --> 00:29:58,827
I left my door open for you.

376
00:29:58,828 --> 00:30:01,508
You've been away over a week.
I wanted to see you!

377
00:30:02,188 --> 00:30:04,627
Why do you think I told Paul to
go to that dinner alone?

378
00:30:04,628 --> 00:30:08,267
I thought we could spend some time together.
It's hard enough in this madhouse.

379
00:30:08,268 --> 00:30:11,907
- You'd rather spend the evening with your mother?
- I didn't have much choice.

380
00:30:11,908 --> 00:30:14,907
I thought you'd come to me afterwards
instead of wandering round like a ghost.

381
00:30:14,908 --> 00:30:16,988
Can we talk about this
in the morning?

382
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:19,511
You can be a real bastard.

383
00:30:19,534 --> 00:30:21,267
- I'm very s...
- Don't touch me!

384
00:30:21,268 --> 00:30:24,827
It's no good now. There's no time anyway,
even by our pathetic standards.

385
00:30:24,828 --> 00:30:26,187
(CAR APPROACHES)

386
00:30:26,188 --> 00:30:28,228
See? That's him now.
Go on, go.

387
00:30:28,748 --> 00:30:31,948
Get some bloody air,
and leave the rest of us to suffocate.

388
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:52,748
(THUMP)

389
00:30:56,468 --> 00:30:58,508
(THUMP)

390
00:31:01,188 --> 00:31:03,267
Ow!

391
00:31:03,268 --> 00:31:05,268
You didn't come and say good night.

392
00:31:08,468 --> 00:31:10,508
- That hurt!
- You promised.

393
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:13,445
I'm sorry.

394
00:31:13,457 --> 00:31:18,107
If you don't come up by the time I count to 50,
I swear I'm going to jump.

395
00:31:18,108 --> 00:31:20,827
- Get back inside now!
- Don't say I didn't warn you.

396
00:31:20,828 --> 00:31:23,067
One, two...

397
00:31:23,068 --> 00:31:26,907
- Get back inside!
- Three, four,

398
00:31:26,908 --> 00:31:31,788
five, six, seven,
eight, nine...

399
00:31:55,268 --> 00:31:57,268
You're lucky I'm not dead.

400
00:32:01,748 --> 00:32:04,107
What on earth did you think
you were doing?

401
00:32:04,108 --> 00:32:06,108
You said you'd come up.

402
00:32:06,628 --> 00:32:08,907
Well, I... I was busy.

403
00:32:08,908 --> 00:32:11,747
- I'm very sorry.
- You promised.

404
00:32:11,748 --> 00:32:13,788
I said I was sorry, and I am.

405
00:32:14,748 --> 00:32:16,748
Very well.

406
00:32:17,028 --> 00:32:19,068
I forgive you. Kiss?

407
00:32:25,668 --> 00:32:27,747
You smell funny.

408
00:32:27,748 --> 00:32:30,748
- What sort of funny?
- Funny, like a doctor.

409
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:37,268
I thought you were never
coming back at all.

410
00:32:37,276 --> 00:32:38,521
Why?

411
00:32:38,544 --> 00:32:43,146
Because you said if things got too difficult,
you'd disappear.

412
00:32:46,188 --> 00:32:48,228
Hmm...

413
00:32:49,828 --> 00:32:51,828
Stop!
What's the matter?

414
00:32:53,028 --> 00:32:55,028
This is Mrs Simpson.

415
00:32:58,388 --> 00:33:00,428
Oh, Mrs Simpson the goldfish.

416
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:04,747
(SNIFFS)
Oh...

417
00:33:04,748 --> 00:33:06,788
She's certainly dead.

418
00:33:12,308 --> 00:33:14,827
What would you have done
if I had disappeared?

419
00:33:14,828 --> 00:33:16,907
Topped myself.

420
00:33:16,908 --> 00:33:19,667
- You don't even know what that means.
- Of course I do, silly!

421
00:33:19,668 --> 00:33:21,707
Children don't kill themselves.

422
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,267
Then why did you run upstairs
so fast just now?

423
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:26,307
Because you might have slipped.

424
00:33:26,308 --> 00:33:28,308
I was holding on.

425
00:33:29,628 --> 00:33:31,628
Now, pass Mr Rabbit.

426
00:33:38,908 --> 00:33:40,947
Thank you.

427
00:33:40,948 --> 00:33:43,267
Now you can tuck me in
and make me snuggly.

428
00:33:43,268 --> 00:33:46,627
And you can promise not to
do anything silly like that again.

429
00:33:46,628 --> 00:33:48,628
- Only if you promise.
- What?

430
00:33:49,188 --> 00:33:51,348
That you'll never go away
and leave me.

431
00:34:01,988 --> 00:34:03,988
Look...

432
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:06,708
Um...

433
00:34:08,188 --> 00:34:10,348
I can't make that promise,
I'm afraid.

434
00:34:12,548 --> 00:34:15,907
Well, you must just hope
for the best

435
00:34:15,908 --> 00:34:19,028
that you stay at home
and that I stay alive.

436
00:34:26,308 --> 00:34:30,547
If I do have to go away,
whatever the reason,

437
00:34:30,548 --> 00:34:32,548
I promise I'll tell you first.

438
00:34:33,628 --> 00:34:35,667
Cross your heart and hope to die?

439
00:34:35,668 --> 00:34:38,307
Cross my heart
and hope neither of us has to die.

440
00:34:38,308 --> 00:34:40,308
Now, go to sleep.

441
00:34:46,948 --> 00:34:49,027
Eee! Eee!

442
00:34:49,028 --> 00:34:52,788
- What's that?
- Mr Rabbit saying good night too.

443
00:34:54,108 --> 00:34:56,108
Good night.

444
00:35:06,468 --> 00:35:08,508
(SIGHS)

445
00:35:12,468 --> 00:35:14,468
Is that you?

446
00:35:15,588 --> 00:35:17,588
Yes, it's... me.
Yes, it's me.

447
00:36:44,212 --> 00:36:46,212
Is this for me?

448
00:36:48,252 --> 00:36:50,252
It says F for Frances.

449
00:36:52,132 --> 00:36:54,132
Oh, then I suppose so.

450
00:36:56,572 --> 00:36:58,572
Can I open it?

451
00:37:06,612 --> 00:37:08,612
Oh, it's beautiful!

452
00:37:12,932 --> 00:37:14,932
Did you have it made specially?

453
00:37:16,332 --> 00:37:18,332
I love it. Thank you.

454
00:37:20,812 --> 00:37:22,851
Will you put it on for me?

455
00:37:22,852 --> 00:37:24,852
Yes, of course.

456
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:47,012
Good morning, sir.

457
00:37:47,692 --> 00:37:50,692
- Mrs Spencer, I hope I'm not disturbing you.
- Not at all.

458
00:37:51,572 --> 00:37:53,572
- I'll go and get dressed.
- Right.

459
00:37:55,212 --> 00:37:57,212
Oh, thank you... George.

460
00:37:59,892 --> 00:38:01,892
Ah... where...
where is everyone?

461
00:38:02,412 --> 00:38:07,451
Your brother's at the foundry, sir.
He's expecting you at er... ten.

462
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:11,692
And your sister and Mrs Paul
are at breakfast.

463
00:38:12,492 --> 00:38:17,012
- And Her Ladyship?
- Indisposed, sir. Likely to remain so the rest of the day.

464
00:38:19,612 --> 00:38:23,572
I... er found this
in your waistcoat pocket, sir.

465
00:38:52,812 --> 00:38:56,891
- Ah... Good morning... Annie.
- Good morning, sir.

466
00:38:56,892 --> 00:38:59,972
- I was just on my way to breakfast.
- Oh, sorry, Mr Spence.

467
00:39:09,212 --> 00:39:11,212
Thank you.

468
00:39:13,012 --> 00:39:15,012
Morning.

469
00:39:24,252 --> 00:39:26,252
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

470
00:39:29,172 --> 00:39:33,331
Can you have a word with Charlotte about having a fire?
It's ridiculous that there isn't one.

471
00:39:33,332 --> 00:39:35,332
Would you like me to light one?

472
00:39:40,492 --> 00:39:43,572
- Did you enjoy your fresh air last night?
- Yes, thank you.

473
00:39:45,292 --> 00:39:49,491
Daddy brought presents for everyone.
Mummy got a locket with a picture of his face on it.

474
00:39:49,492 --> 00:39:52,211
- I'm not sure you should be...
- Is this one for me?

475
00:39:52,212 --> 00:39:54,251
- It says an L on it.
- Ah... well...

476
00:39:54,252 --> 00:39:56,332
And this is for you
and for Auntie Nina

477
00:39:57,212 --> 00:39:59,292
and one for Auntie Blanche
and my one.

478
00:40:07,612 --> 00:40:09,731
<i>Charlotte's Web</i>!
Just what I wanted!

479
00:40:09,732 --> 00:40:11,732
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.

480
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:22,252
I suppose you think that's funny?

481
00:40:22,812 --> 00:40:26,412
You really don't care about anyone,
do you, except for yourself!

482
00:40:33,372 --> 00:40:35,531
- Can I open her present?
- No, you can't.

483
00:40:35,532 --> 00:40:36,851
(DOOR OPENS)

484
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:39,371
George is waiting out front, sir,
when you're ready.

485
00:40:39,372 --> 00:40:41,372
Thank you. I'm coming now.

486
00:40:42,892 --> 00:40:44,892
- Can I have it?
- Absolutely not.

487
00:40:47,652 --> 00:40:49,652
"To my darling B. XXX"

488
00:40:50,412 --> 00:40:52,412
Isn't it pretty?

489
00:40:53,052 --> 00:40:55,652
(SNIFFS)
That stinks.

490
00:40:57,452 --> 00:40:59,532
May I offer my congratulations, sir?

491
00:41:00,052 --> 00:41:02,091
- What for?
- The Leverton contract.

492
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:04,972
Your mother gave Mr Paul the good news
this morning.

493
00:41:06,012 --> 00:41:08,051
Ah.

494
00:41:08,052 --> 00:41:10,652
There'll be
quite a celebration tonight, sir.

495
00:41:39,332 --> 00:41:41,332
Well done, sir.

496
00:41:55,252 --> 00:41:57,411
I'm sorry.
I couldn't keep it a secret.

497
00:41:57,412 --> 00:41:59,451
It's been like Christmas.

498
00:41:59,452 --> 00:42:02,291
I don't think anyone's done
a scrap of work all day.

499
00:42:02,292 --> 00:42:04,292
Welcome, sir.

500
00:42:12,092 --> 00:42:14,682
Come on, how did you do it?
I just couldn't believe it.

501
00:42:14,705 --> 00:42:16,044
I hardly know myself.

502
00:42:16,052 --> 00:42:17,704
It's incredible that
they accepted our terms.

503
00:42:17,728 --> 00:42:19,830
- Well done, sir.
- Thank you

504
00:42:19,852 --> 00:42:21,899
- Have you got the contract?
- Er... no, not with me.

505
00:42:21,923 --> 00:42:22,874
But you did sign it?

506
00:42:22,892 --> 00:42:25,411
There are some details to finalise.
They'll send it on.

507
00:42:25,412 --> 00:42:28,091
A letter arrived for you this morning.
That's probably it.

508
00:42:28,092 --> 00:42:30,771
I want to hear the whole story,
but I've got to go to the bank.

509
00:42:30,772 --> 00:42:33,731
I had a tricky meeting with Thornton
while you were away.

510
00:42:33,732 --> 00:42:35,971
- Congratulations, sir.
- Oh, thank you.

511
00:42:35,972 --> 00:42:38,892
Arthur, can you make sure
everyone gets back to work?

512
00:42:40,052 --> 00:42:42,972
Sorry about last night.
I had a bit of a spat with Nina.

513
00:42:43,932 --> 00:42:45,971
I wasn't quite myself.

514
00:42:45,972 --> 00:42:48,011
Jolly well done.

515
00:42:48,012 --> 00:42:50,012
I really mean that.

516
00:42:54,428 --> 00:42:57,187
Just the sort of thing your father
would have pulled off,

517
00:42:57,211 --> 00:42:59,923
if you don't mind me saying so, sir.

518
00:42:59,947 --> 00:43:02,181
I felt, well, that sometimes,

519
00:43:02,193 --> 00:43:06,138
you didn't understand
the lives of the men and women here.

520
00:43:06,162 --> 00:43:08,604
I'm happy to admit I was wrong.

521
00:43:09,172 --> 00:43:11,692
It's a terrible thing
for a man to have no work.

522
00:43:13,012 --> 00:43:15,051
Yes, I know.

523
00:43:15,052 --> 00:43:18,091
We will need some funds by next week
to cover the wages.

524
00:43:18,108 --> 00:43:20,479
The accounts are all here, sir.

525
00:43:20,503 --> 00:43:23,172
Mr Paul and I went through everything
ourselves yesterday.

526
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,852
And again, congratulations, sir.

527
00:43:28,812 --> 00:43:30,812
Thank you.

528
00:44:06,732 --> 00:44:08,732
Don't worry, I'll get him.

529
00:44:10,612 --> 00:44:14,051
Darling, you haven't even changed,
and it's half past seven!

530
00:44:14,052 --> 00:44:16,091
Everyone's about to go in.

531
00:44:16,092 --> 00:44:18,411
- I'm not very hungry.
- What are you doing?

532
00:44:18,412 --> 00:44:21,731
Trying to understand these reports
about the glassworks.

533
00:44:21,732 --> 00:44:24,931
- I thought that was Paul's job.
- I'd like to understand them myself.

534
00:44:24,932 --> 00:44:28,052
- You still have to eat.
- Sandwich, maybe? Glass of water?

535
00:44:29,408 --> 00:44:30,699
You are in an odd mood.

536
00:44:30,723 --> 00:44:32,931
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

537
00:44:32,932 --> 00:44:35,932
It's rather nice to have to
look after you for a change.

538
00:44:37,412 --> 00:44:39,451
We could take a picnic upstairs.

539
00:44:39,452 --> 00:44:41,971
Just us.
I'll tell them I'm not feeling well.

540
00:44:41,972 --> 00:44:43,972
They're used to that.

541
00:44:55,932 --> 00:44:59,891
I used to have to stop boys having midnight feasts.
Here I am eating one.

542
00:44:59,892 --> 00:45:02,292
- I didn't know you were a prefect.
- I wasn't.

543
00:45:02,892 --> 00:45:06,452
I mean, I was. I just wasn't a...
very good one.

544
00:45:07,812 --> 00:45:10,531
If Charlotte finds out about all this,
I'm dead.

545
00:45:10,532 --> 00:45:15,932
So is Annie. She caught me in the larder,
but I managed to persuade her that my cause was just.

546
00:45:17,332 --> 00:45:20,052
She's very excited at
the news about the foundry.

547
00:45:20,412 --> 00:45:22,532
You're so clever to have
managed that.

548
00:45:23,612 --> 00:45:25,612
The trouble is I haven't.

549
00:45:26,732 --> 00:45:31,151
- Oh.
- That's why I was reading all those papers.

550
00:45:32,652 --> 00:45:38,052
Did you know there was a report before the war,
commissioned by my sister from a chap called A Farr?

551
00:45:39,652 --> 00:45:43,292
- Alice Farr.
- Actually, it's rather good as a matter of fact.

552
00:45:44,292 --> 00:45:47,811
Why don't you go back to your papers
while I get this cleared up?

553
00:45:47,812 --> 00:45:50,651
- Let me help.
- No. Thank you. I'd rather do it myself.

554
00:45:50,652 --> 00:45:52,652
- No, please.
- I mean it!

555
00:46:24,612 --> 00:46:27,851
- What are these doing here?
- I was reading them last night.

556
00:46:27,852 --> 00:46:29,852
It's a bit late, isn't it?

557
00:46:31,412 --> 00:46:35,451
Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.
I didn't know what I was doing.

558
00:46:35,452 --> 00:46:37,932
Really! I think you knew exactly
what you were doing.

559
00:46:40,332 --> 00:46:42,371
What would you have done?

560
00:46:42,395 --> 00:46:43,839
What would I have done?

561
00:46:43,863 --> 00:46:46,411
I probably wouldn't have seduced
my sister-in-law for a start.

562
00:46:46,412 --> 00:46:48,026
About the Leverton contract.

563
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:50,633
Whatwould you have done if
they had refused to accept our terms?

564
00:46:50,652 --> 00:46:53,691
- What does it matter? They've signed.
- But if they hadn't, what then?

565
00:46:53,692 --> 00:46:56,891
I would have done anything to keep
the furnaces burning. You know that.

566
00:46:56,892 --> 00:47:01,331
It's madness to rely on a single contract.
You should never have allowed us to be in this position.

567
00:47:01,332 --> 00:47:04,611
I read that report last night.

568
00:47:04,612 --> 00:47:08,251
I didn't fully understand it,
but he seemed to take it seriously.

569
00:47:08,252 --> 00:47:10,252
He did until you told him not to.

570
00:47:11,812 --> 00:47:13,812
Are these Alice's designs?

571
00:47:15,172 --> 00:47:17,172
You complete shit!

572
00:47:19,572 --> 00:47:22,331
Crockett wants to know about
the shoot on Sunday.

573
00:47:22,332 --> 00:47:26,651
He's suggesting starting at Begley End this year
and driving up towards Moorcroft.

574
00:47:26,652 --> 00:47:29,932
They walked it yesterday,
and they say the ground's solid.

575
00:47:30,332 --> 00:47:32,732
He'll be here at 11:00
to go over it with you.

576
00:47:34,892 --> 00:47:39,012
Sounds good. I have to go into town at ten,
so maybe you could take care of it?

577
00:47:41,172 --> 00:47:44,172
Well, of course,
if that's what you want.

578
00:47:44,852 --> 00:47:47,732
And I have a hair appointment.
We can go in together.

579
00:47:48,052 --> 00:47:50,052
I'll just go and get ready.

580
00:47:52,012 --> 00:47:54,012
I'll see to Crockett, then.

581
00:47:54,292 --> 00:47:56,292
Do you have to go in?

582
00:47:57,092 --> 00:47:59,411
I have some things to sort out
in the bank.

583
00:47:59,412 --> 00:48:03,804
Well, you'll find them much more amenable.
They were very pleased about the contract.

584
00:48:03,827 --> 00:48:05,001
Good.

585
00:48:11,732 --> 00:48:13,732
Ah, yes. Mayfair 242.

586
00:48:16,052 --> 00:48:20,332
I'd like to speak to Sir Matthew Leverton.
It's Mr Spence from Century Glass.

587
00:48:21,172 --> 00:48:24,972
Well, you'll have to interrupt the meeting.
He'll want to hear this personally.

588
00:48:31,772 --> 00:48:34,691
- Can I come into town with you?
- I'm going on business.

589
00:48:34,692 --> 00:48:36,692
Please? It's really important.

590
00:48:39,652 --> 00:48:43,411
On second thought, that's a very good idea.
Of course you can come.

591
00:48:43,412 --> 00:48:46,531
Sorry we're late.
Mary Lou is coming with us.

592
00:48:46,532 --> 00:48:48,652
Very important mission, apparently.

593
00:48:54,892 --> 00:48:56,892
Nothing I could do.

594
00:49:13,212 --> 00:49:15,246
- We need to talk.
- Yes, of course.

595
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:16,785
- Alone.
- Right.

596
00:49:17,692 --> 00:49:19,731
- Can I sit in the front?
- Yes.

597
00:49:19,732 --> 00:49:23,012
- Where are you going?
- Argyle Street. That junk shop.

598
00:49:23,732 --> 00:49:25,732
- Look after her.
- Yes.

599
00:49:37,292 --> 00:49:40,051
This is the last one.
That's everything we have.

600
00:49:40,052 --> 00:49:42,091
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

601
00:49:42,092 --> 00:49:44,969
But I think it would be better to discuss
any queries you may have with Mr Thornton

602
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,507
when he returns.

603
00:49:46,532 --> 00:49:48,036
There's definitely nothing else?
No other account?

604
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:49,844
No, sir. That's everything.

605
00:49:50,773 --> 00:49:55,011
What's this? There seems to be something
in this account, quite a lot.

606
00:49:55,012 --> 00:49:56,998
In fact, £1 million.

607
00:49:57,021 --> 00:49:59,957
I'm sorry, sir. This account is in the wrong file.
I shouldn't have brought it out.

608
00:49:59,972 --> 00:50:02,011
It says Spence at the top.

609
00:50:02,012 --> 00:50:04,851
Um... that's because
it's your wife's trust fund.

610
00:50:04,852 --> 00:50:06,891
Are you saying
that's gone as well?

611
00:50:06,892 --> 00:50:09,759
No, sir. The principle sum
has not been paid out

612
00:50:09,782 --> 00:50:12,236
- because of the terms of the marriage settlement.
- What terms?

613
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:15,812
- Perhaps I can make an appointment...
- Do you know who I am?

614
00:50:16,172 --> 00:50:18,211
Of course, Mr Spence.

615
00:50:18,212 --> 00:50:22,651
There can hardly be anything irregular about
discussing my own marriage settlement, can there?

616
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:24,691
No, sir. I suppose not.

617
00:50:24,692 --> 00:50:26,692
- Well?
- Well...

618
00:50:27,412 --> 00:50:31,251
I'm not completely familiar
with the document,

619
00:50:31,252 --> 00:50:35,171
but my understanding is that
the money is only to be paid out

620
00:50:35,172 --> 00:50:39,651
in the event of your wife
conceiving a male heir,

621
00:50:39,652 --> 00:50:42,252
unless, of course,
she should predecease you.

622
00:50:43,092 --> 00:50:45,092
A male heir?

623
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:48,252
Sir Alfred was most insistent.

624
00:50:53,172 --> 00:50:55,811
So a granddaughter
wasn't good enough for him.

625
00:50:55,812 --> 00:50:57,812
It would appear not, sir.

626
00:50:59,052 --> 00:51:01,052
Thank you, Mr Myerson.
My coat.

627
00:51:04,492 --> 00:51:06,531
There is one other thing.

628
00:51:06,532 --> 00:51:08,971
There's a painting up at the house.
I'd like it valued.

629
00:51:08,972 --> 00:51:12,532
- Yes, sir. I'm sure that can be arranged.
- You've been most helpful.

630
00:51:25,012 --> 00:51:27,932
Sorry, excuse me.
Do you know where Argyle Street is?

631
00:51:46,452 --> 00:51:50,692
I'm looking for a little girl,
my daughter.

632
00:51:55,252 --> 00:51:57,291
Upstairs?

633
00:51:57,292 --> 00:51:59,292
Thank you.

634
00:52:20,972 --> 00:52:22,972
What are you doing here?

635
00:52:24,492 --> 00:52:27,971
Um... I'm looking for a little girl.
The gentleman downstairs indicated...

636
00:52:27,972 --> 00:52:30,011
You should never send a child here.

637
00:52:30,012 --> 00:52:32,292
It shows lack of respect for
your family.

638
00:52:34,412 --> 00:52:36,451
- I've missed you.
- Where is she?

639
00:52:36,452 --> 00:52:39,571
The child? She left half an hour ago
with the chauffeur.

640
00:52:39,572 --> 00:52:42,411
So, did your wife like our
<i>petit cadeau</i>?

641
00:52:42,412 --> 00:52:45,011
Did she think I painted
a good likeness of you?

642
00:52:45,012 --> 00:52:47,012
Er...yes. Yes. She... She um...

643
00:52:48,212 --> 00:52:50,931
- She loved it as a matter of fact.
- So she's happy?

644
00:52:50,932 --> 00:52:54,012
And what about me?
Did you find Bela's little present?

645
00:52:55,252 --> 00:52:57,291
- The perfume?
- Yes. Did you find it?

646
00:52:57,292 --> 00:53:00,531
- I gave it to my sister.
- What? Does she still hate you? Why?

647
00:53:00,532 --> 00:53:03,315
- It was a mistake.
- That must have been a surprise for her.

648
00:53:03,339 --> 00:53:04,278
Yes, it was.

649
00:53:04,301 --> 00:53:06,411
- Did it make her happy?
- No, it didn't.

650
00:53:06,412 --> 00:53:08,412
- Then we are both unhappy.
- Oh!

651
00:53:09,492 --> 00:53:11,492
What are you going to do about this?

652
00:53:15,652 --> 00:53:17,971
- Where's your father?
- Still in the bank.

653
00:53:17,972 --> 00:53:20,011
(SIGHS)
Well, we're not waiting.

654
00:53:20,012 --> 00:53:23,732
George can come back for him.
Get in, and take that out of your mouth.

655
00:53:34,132 --> 00:53:36,971
- That little girl of yours is adorable.
- Yes, she is.

656
00:53:36,972 --> 00:53:40,931
- Why was she here?
- She wants me to mend something for her.

657
00:53:40,932 --> 00:53:43,171
A plate from your regiment.

658
00:53:43,172 --> 00:53:45,491
She thinks you will be angry
it is broken.

659
00:53:45,492 --> 00:53:47,492
Oh, so that's the big secret.

660
00:53:48,172 --> 00:53:50,292
- You're not angry?
- No. Why should I be?

661
00:53:51,652 --> 00:53:53,691
She seemed to expect it.

662
00:53:53,692 --> 00:53:56,716
She loves you,
but she fears you also.

663
00:53:58,132 --> 00:54:00,331
The truth is I'm the one
who should be afraid.

664
00:54:00,332 --> 00:54:03,932
She almost jumped out of a window
because I didn't say good night.

665
00:54:04,932 --> 00:54:06,932
I think she loves me.

666
00:54:08,132 --> 00:54:10,132
It's quite an unusual feeling.

667
00:54:11,332 --> 00:54:13,371
You're in a strange mood.

668
00:54:13,372 --> 00:54:15,372
Did something happen in London?

669
00:54:16,052 --> 00:54:18,091
What do you mean?

670
00:54:18,092 --> 00:54:20,092
I don't know.
You seem different.

671
00:54:21,172 --> 00:54:23,172
You were different just now.

672
00:54:23,772 --> 00:54:25,812
- How?
- Not sure.

673
00:54:26,572 --> 00:54:28,572
Gentler, perhaps.
I like that.

674
00:54:30,252 --> 00:54:33,504
- People change.
- That's not so usual.

675
00:54:33,528 --> 00:54:35,031
I'm the proof.

676
00:54:35,054 --> 00:54:38,386
I don't think we know what we're capable of
until we're given the opportunity.

677
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:39,900
That I do believe.

678
00:54:39,924 --> 00:54:43,692
I have seen what people are capable of
if they are given the opportunity.

679
00:54:44,292 --> 00:54:46,412
- That's why I'm here.
- Why are you here?

680
00:54:47,972 --> 00:54:50,011
We agreed, no stories.

681
00:54:50,012 --> 00:54:52,051
Please? I'd like to know.

682
00:54:52,052 --> 00:54:54,091
You would not understand.

683
00:54:54,092 --> 00:54:57,651
The English do not know what it is like
to be occupied by an enemy.

684
00:54:57,652 --> 00:54:59,691
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

685
00:54:59,692 --> 00:55:01,692
That was a long time ago.

686
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:04,532
But now, you are the hero of war,

687
00:55:05,092 --> 00:55:08,372
with your plate from your loyal men
to their brave captain.

688
00:55:09,412 --> 00:55:11,412
I don't feel very brave.

689
00:55:12,132 --> 00:55:15,212
You're ticklish.
You've been lying to me all that time?

690
00:55:17,372 --> 00:55:19,372
I told you, people change.

691
00:55:20,052 --> 00:55:22,771
You mean ticklish one day,
not ticklish the next?

692
00:55:22,772 --> 00:55:24,812
I don't think that's possible.

693
00:55:30,572 --> 00:55:32,572
- Ahem.
- How did you know I was here?

694
00:55:32,932 --> 00:55:36,572
They said at the bank that you left before lunch,
so I thought I might find you here.

695
00:55:37,412 --> 00:55:39,971
- Oh, I see.
- There's a funeral to attend, sir,

696
00:55:39,972 --> 00:55:43,571
and I'm under strict instructions to
ensure you're not late.

697
00:55:50,969 --> 00:55:54,608
FATHER MCREADY: Our father in heaven,
who notices even the falling of a sparrow,

698
00:55:54,609 --> 00:55:58,368
must surely, then, have noted the
untimely passing of Mrs Simpson.

699
00:55:58,369 --> 00:56:03,169
We commend her to His care, and ask His comfort
for those on earth who mourn her passing.

700
00:56:03,929 --> 00:56:08,688
In the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost. Amen.

701
00:56:08,689 --> 00:56:10,689
- Amen.
- Amen.

702
00:56:14,849 --> 00:56:16,849
Throw some on there.

703
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:24,369
Come on, Piglet.
I think it's an early bed for you tonight.

704
00:56:25,969 --> 00:56:28,008
Do fishes go to heaven?

705
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:30,048
I'm sure they do.

706
00:56:30,049 --> 00:56:32,088
There are rather a lot of them.

707
00:56:32,089 --> 00:56:37,408
Well, if you'll excuse me, I need a chance to
even the score with your mother before she has her rest.

708
00:56:37,409 --> 00:56:41,268
Could I possibly have
a word with you first, Father?

709
00:56:41,289 --> 00:56:43,328
Yes, of course.

710
00:56:43,329 --> 00:56:46,688
It's true a priest cannot reveal
the secrets of confession?

711
00:56:46,689 --> 00:56:48,728
That is correct.

712
00:56:48,729 --> 00:56:51,929
- Can I make one? Please.
- Now?

713
00:56:53,449 --> 00:56:56,088
Well, it is possible.
God's ear is everywhere.

714
00:56:56,089 --> 00:56:58,089
How do I begin?

715
00:56:58,849 --> 00:57:00,888
Dear me, Johnny!

716
00:57:00,889 --> 00:57:04,689
I know it's a long time, but you must remember.
We learnt it together.

717
00:57:05,849 --> 00:57:09,968
- Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
- Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

718
00:57:09,969 --> 00:57:12,569
It is a very long time
since my last confession.

719
00:57:14,049 --> 00:57:17,649
- This is going to be a little unusual.
- I think it already is.

720
00:57:18,609 --> 00:57:20,609
I want to talk about
me and my sister.

721
00:57:22,009 --> 00:57:24,009
I see. Go on.

722
00:57:24,249 --> 00:57:26,249
- I think you understand why.
- I do?

723
00:57:27,129 --> 00:57:29,129
Do I? Oh!

724
00:57:29,929 --> 00:57:33,128
- That unfortunate girl, the glass designer?
- Yes.

725
00:57:33,129 --> 00:57:35,168
Yes. That's exactly it.

726
00:57:35,169 --> 00:57:37,208
Alice, wasn't that her name?

727
00:57:37,209 --> 00:57:39,248
Alice Farr.

728
00:57:39,249 --> 00:57:41,249
Quite.
Terrible, quite terrible.

729
00:57:42,369 --> 00:57:45,128
I think, in some ways,
what happened was my fault.

730
00:57:45,129 --> 00:57:47,129
It certainly was not!

731
00:57:47,729 --> 00:57:51,888
The coroner was very clear that no-one
in the family was in any way to blame.

732
00:57:51,889 --> 00:57:56,169
The girl was of unsound mind,
with no respect for the sanctity of her own life.

733
00:57:56,569 --> 00:57:59,408
Your sister, as you know,
took it very personally.

734
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:02,289
Too personally, in my view,
and your mother agreed.

735
00:58:03,169 --> 00:58:08,129
And then, of course, there was the
very sad business of the poor child.

736
00:58:08,689 --> 00:58:12,528
Never drew breath, of course,
but because of the girl's selfish act,

737
00:58:12,529 --> 00:58:17,009
it could not enter the presence of God
because it carried the stain of mortal sin.

738
00:58:18,249 --> 00:58:21,049
Surely, if there was sin,
it was that of the father?

739
00:58:21,929 --> 00:58:24,769
The father, whoever he was,

740
00:58:25,769 --> 00:58:27,769
had, of course, sinned,

741
00:58:28,569 --> 00:58:30,569
but he can be forgiven.

742
00:58:31,489 --> 00:58:34,489
He would just need to confess
and be given absolution.

743
00:58:36,169 --> 00:58:39,369
- And can he be forgiven for what he did?
- Of course.

744
00:58:40,689 --> 00:58:45,089
You can be forgiven for anything,
provided you make a proper act of contrition.

745
00:58:46,649 --> 00:58:50,649
- Thank you, Father. That was very helpful.
- But that wasn't a confession.

746
00:58:51,329 --> 00:58:53,368
No. No.

747
00:58:53,369 --> 00:58:57,100
Would you mind awfully if I had some
time alone with my mother this evening?

748
00:58:57,124 --> 00:58:59,608
No. No, of course not.

749
00:58:59,609 --> 00:59:01,648
My vow was poverty.

750
00:59:01,649 --> 00:59:03,649
Thank you.

751
00:59:10,889 --> 00:59:12,889
(KNOCKING)

752
00:59:15,289 --> 00:59:17,289
How was the funeral?

753
00:59:18,289 --> 00:59:20,289
Very moving.

754
00:59:21,649 --> 00:59:24,169
I heard about your performance
at breakfast.

755
00:59:25,089 --> 00:59:27,128
It made me laugh.

756
00:59:27,129 --> 00:59:30,448
- What were you thinking, giving your sister perfume?
- I wasn't thinking.

757
00:59:30,449 --> 00:59:32,488
Anyway, Frances loves her locket.

758
00:59:32,489 --> 00:59:35,528
Why the sudden concern for that
barren stick of a girl?

759
00:59:35,529 --> 00:59:37,928
She's not barren.
She has a very beautiful daughter.

760
00:59:37,929 --> 00:59:40,009
Exactly, and that nearly killed her.

761
00:59:40,889 --> 00:59:42,928
Sometimes, I wish it had.

762
00:59:42,929 --> 00:59:44,968
- No, you don't.
- Don't I?

763
00:59:44,969 --> 00:59:47,808
Don't pretend you haven't
thought of it yourself.

764
00:59:47,809 --> 00:59:50,488
If she'd died,
you needn't have worried about a son.

765
00:59:50,489 --> 00:59:54,328
You'd have inherited everything and the family
and the foundry would have been safe,

766
00:59:54,329 --> 00:59:56,329
which is why we chose her
in the first place.

767
00:59:57,889 --> 01:00:01,273
- Is it?
- Well, you know it is.

768
01:00:05,089 --> 01:00:08,689
Well, if we want to keep the foundry safe,
we have to pay the wages,

769
01:00:09,489 --> 01:00:12,369
so I'm thinking of selling the
Vermeer in the study.

770
01:00:13,369 --> 01:00:15,408
Really?

771
01:00:15,409 --> 01:00:17,648
- You don't mind?
- Of course I don't mind.

772
01:00:17,649 --> 01:00:21,368
Although I don't see how it will help.
It's a fake, as you well know.

773
01:00:21,369 --> 01:00:25,048
You've left it a little late to play the saint,
my dear.

774
01:00:25,049 --> 01:00:27,649
The best pictures went long ago,
with the land.

775
01:00:32,449 --> 01:00:34,808
- So, how do you expect to survive?
- I don't.

776
01:00:34,809 --> 01:00:36,809
It's the end for houses like this.

777
01:00:37,329 --> 01:00:39,368
No-one can support them any more.

778
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:43,008
I mean, look at poor Freddy Thynne,
opening Longleat to the public.

779
01:00:43,009 --> 01:00:46,409
Well, I don't intend to be around to see
strangers gawping at this house.

780
01:00:52,449 --> 01:00:58,889
Zeus once decided to punish a king by
setting out a huge feast in front of him every day,

781
01:00:59,449 --> 01:01:01,968
but each time the king
reached for something to eat,

782
01:01:01,969 --> 01:01:07,248
a winged harpy snatched it away from him,
and so he starved in the face of plenty.

783
01:01:07,249 --> 01:01:09,768
There's a banquet
in front of you here.

784
01:01:09,769 --> 01:01:12,689
There are no harpies,
but you're all still starving.

785
01:01:14,569 --> 01:01:16,648
The inevitable has to be accepted.

786
01:01:16,649 --> 01:01:20,528
Does it? Or is the inevitable something
that comes in a syringe of morphine?

787
01:01:20,529 --> 01:01:23,288
I take my pleasure where I can,
just as you take yours.

788
01:01:23,289 --> 01:01:25,889
What if we stopped, both of us,
just for one day?

789
01:01:27,569 --> 01:01:31,289
Why don't you come down
and greet your guests tomorrow at the shoot?

790
01:01:33,009 --> 01:01:35,009
This house needs you.

791
01:01:37,129 --> 01:01:39,129
It's too late to change.

792
01:01:40,129 --> 01:01:42,129
We are what we are.

793
01:01:48,009 --> 01:01:50,048
I can't see anything at all.

794
01:01:50,049 --> 01:01:53,369
It's like that night we drove to
Inverness on our honeymoon.

795
01:01:53,809 --> 01:01:55,928
Oh, my goodness!
Look, there's a man!

796
01:01:55,929 --> 01:01:57,968
- Oh, yes.
- What are they saying?

797
01:01:57,969 --> 01:02:00,889
- You have to turn up the sound control.
- Oh, yes. Sorry.

TV: <i>New coins for the coronation of
Queen Elizabeth.</i>

799
01:02:08,009 --> 01:02:11,968
<i>The design of the new coins has
already aroused spirited controversy,</i>

800
01:02:11,969 --> 01:02:15,328
<i>with some commentators saying that
Her Majesty looks too girlish.</i>

801
01:02:15,329 --> 01:02:16,688
(TV OFF)

802
01:02:16,689 --> 01:02:19,089
I'm sorry.
There's something I want to say.

803
01:02:20,689 --> 01:02:24,529
I haven't been
strictly truthful with you all.

804
01:02:25,569 --> 01:02:28,249
I didn't do a deal with Leverton's
in London last week.

805
01:02:29,169 --> 01:02:31,208
I did one this morning.

806
01:02:31,209 --> 01:02:37,048
It isn't a very good arrangement.
In fact, it's pretty bad from our point of view.

807
01:02:37,049 --> 01:02:39,049
So it was a lie all along?

808
01:02:40,369 --> 01:02:42,369
- Why?
- I was a coward.

809
01:02:43,289 --> 01:02:47,209
What I should have done...
What I'm trying to do now is ask for your help.

810
01:02:48,449 --> 01:02:50,729
It's a bit late for that,
don't you think?

811
01:02:53,249 --> 01:02:55,249
I don't see what we can do.

812
01:02:56,009 --> 01:02:59,208
- We shut it down. That's his plan.
- Abandoning the foundry won't save us,

813
01:02:59,209 --> 01:03:03,129
and even if it did, what kind of life would it be
if we can eat when everyone else is hungry?

814
01:03:04,169 --> 01:03:06,849
That's not something
that bothered you before.

815
01:03:07,289 --> 01:03:09,328
So what are you suggesting?

816
01:03:09,329 --> 01:03:13,168
We find a way to raise some finance
while we come up with another plan.

817
01:03:13,169 --> 01:03:16,728
I read Alice Farr's report last night,
and I think it could work.

818
01:03:16,729 --> 01:03:19,649
- You said it was completely impractical.
- I was wrong.

819
01:03:21,369 --> 01:03:23,369
Blanche will never agree.

820
01:03:40,889 --> 01:03:43,369
I don't understand
what you're trying to do.

821
01:03:46,049 --> 01:03:48,049
Make it better.

822
01:03:50,889 --> 01:03:52,929
Well, you can't.

823
01:03:54,689 --> 01:03:56,689
I have to try.

824
01:04:00,449 --> 01:04:02,609
Blanche,
no-one can bring Alice back.

825
01:04:02,969 --> 01:04:05,049
Don't you dare bring Alice into this.

826
01:04:06,689 --> 01:04:08,729
You know nothing about her.

827
01:04:09,729 --> 01:04:12,289
You never understood her
for a single second.

828
01:04:13,609 --> 01:04:16,489
Do you remember when
you set fire to my doll's house?

829
01:04:17,329 --> 01:04:19,369
You did it because I loved it.

830
01:04:20,169 --> 01:04:22,809
Because it was mine.
Because you were jealous.

831
01:04:24,129 --> 01:04:27,569
Just like you always are,
jealous of anything you can't have.

832
01:04:31,609 --> 01:04:34,529
Well, Daddy can't buy a new one
and make it better this time.

833
01:04:36,969 --> 01:04:38,969
I know that.

834
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:41,609
She loved me.

835
01:04:42,529 --> 01:04:44,888
That's what you couldn't bear,
wasn't it?

836
01:04:44,889 --> 01:04:46,929
So you had to have her.

837
01:04:49,609 --> 01:04:54,049
Alice wasn't like us.
She had no idea how people like us can behave.

838
01:04:56,889 --> 01:04:58,889
It drove her mad.

839
01:04:59,689 --> 01:05:02,489
And because of me and...

840
01:05:03,409 --> 01:05:07,289
what I had done,
she felt she couldn't turn to anyone?

841
01:05:09,289 --> 01:05:11,329
Not even you.

842
01:05:13,369 --> 01:05:16,088
You may not believe it,
but I know how that feels,

843
01:05:16,089 --> 01:05:18,129
and I think you do too.

844
01:05:20,729 --> 01:05:22,769
We can't bring Alice back,

845
01:05:23,569 --> 01:05:26,289
but we can think about
what she might have wanted.

846
01:05:27,129 --> 01:05:31,449
We can make the ideas she believed in real,
and that way, something survives.

- Your Ladyship?
- Not tonight.

I just wanted to say good night.

01:07:46,089 --> 01:07:48,129
Good night.

858
01:07:50,089 --> 01:07:52,128
I...

859
01:07:52,129 --> 01:07:54,208
I liked your speech.

01:07:54,209 --> 01:07:56,208
Thank you.

861
01:07:56,209 --> 01:08:00,049
- You're a very surprising man.
- I don't think my sister was impressed.

862
01:08:00,649 --> 01:08:02,689
Give her time.

Do you think you can find the money?

I don't know, but I intend to try.

I just wish there was
a way I could help.

866
01:08:10,569 --> 01:08:14,449
You have. I wouldn't have had the courage
to say anything without you.

867
01:08:18,569 --> 01:08:20,609
Good night.

- Please, you don't have to explain.
- No. I want to tell you.

I broke your regimental plate.

872

It was completely stupid of me,
I just touched it somehow,

01:09:05,482 --> 01:09:07,466
- and it broke.
- I know.

I don't mind if you are.

I'm really not angry.

I know I've been a terrible disappointment
as a wife.

I need to get up
and I need to get dressed.

- Of course I'm sure.

I'm so happy.

I'd almost forgotten
how beautiful it is.

- The tweed, of course.

It's the shoot today.

You didn't take the pistol out
by any chance?

900
01:12:02,009 --> 01:12:04,328
- Certainly not. Why?
- It's gone missing.

901
01:12:04,329 --> 01:12:06,648
One of the keepers
must have borrowed it.

- Morning.
- Good morning. Thank you.

- Well, it's your gun, Johnny.

01:12:13,769 --> 01:12:16,933
- Yes, of course. I'll manage.
- You can try mine if you like,

906
01:12:16,945 --> 01:12:19,023
but you're always so rude about it.

01:12:19,047 --> 01:12:21,630
- Why not?
- I'll try yours, then.

- Always wanted to.
- That's much better.

01:12:35,049 --> 01:12:37,408
Never mind,
Sawyer can look after us both.

914
01:12:37,409 --> 01:12:40,889
- I thought that was a brave thing you said last night.
- Thank you.

What's the matter?
Have they left you behind?

919
01:13:23,849 --> 01:13:27,169
Don't you worry.
We'll soon have everything back to normal.

920
01:13:35,409 --> 01:13:37,568
What's that scratch
on my rear bumper?

921
01:13:37,569 --> 01:13:41,128
- It's being attended to, ma'am, I assure you.
- It had better be.

922
01:13:41,129 --> 01:13:44,889
Now, let me be. I can manage this.

Darling, what are you doing here?

924
01:14:06,289 --> 01:14:08,329
Is something the matter?

925
01:14:08,929 --> 01:14:12,809
- What on earth are you wearing?
- Don't ask. I've had a terrible morning.

926
01:14:21,409 --> 01:14:23,449
You really are quite remarkable.

927
01:14:24,129 --> 01:14:26,168
Thank you so much.

933

something very, very sinful,

but it'll make everything right
for all of us.

938
01:15:04,249 --> 01:15:06,249
Of course.

01:15:08,129 --> 01:15:10,169

They must have already
gone to the barn for lunch.

- We'd better get a move on.
- I just need to do something.

- I'll be quick.
- All right. I'll wait in the car.

I'm told you've been shooting
like a girl all morning. Is this true?

956

No, no. He borrowed one of my guns
instead of using his own.

957
01:17:32,209 --> 01:17:35,168
That's the problem.
He's just too polite to admit it.

I've never heard him
accused of that before.

I'd just like to say how pleased
we are to see you all here today.

01:18:33,187 --> 01:18:35,626
I'm told we have
a record kill this morning.

01:18:35,627 --> 01:18:37,786
Why aren't you at
the head of the table?

964

I thought Paul would do it better.

965
01:18:39,827 --> 01:18:43,506
Another minor record is that,
for the first time in living memory,

966
01:18:43,507 --> 01:18:47,226

than my brother Johnny.

in raising a glass to my mother,

looking so radiant.

I've spent too long away
from this family.

973

I don't seem to recognise anybody.

974
01:19:11,987 --> 01:19:14,787

now I come to think of it.

I didn't expect to see you here.

What have you done with Frances?
Isn't she here yet?

978
01:19:38,147 --> 01:19:40,147
Excuse me. Sorry.

979
01:19:43,947 --> 01:19:46,787
- Darling, where's Mummy?
- You know.

980
01:19:49,067 --> 01:19:52,558
- What do you mean?
- I saw you.

981
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:53,535
Where?

982
01:19:53,547 --> 01:19:55,747
Just now, with Mummy,
giving her Granny's medicine.

983
01:19:57,707 --> 01:19:59,827
Why do you keep
changing your clothes?

984
01:20:01,787 --> 01:20:03,787
Oh, God...

985
01:20:11,707 --> 01:20:14,346
- Where's Frances?
- Isn't she at lunch with you?

986
01:20:14,347 --> 01:20:16,347
No, she's not.

988
01:20:21,587 --> 01:20:24,347
Darling?
Charlotte! Quickly!

989
01:20:27,587 --> 01:20:30,107
- How much has she taken?
- Enough. Lift her.

990
01:20:31,267 --> 01:20:33,306
We need to get her blood pressure up.

991
01:20:33,307 --> 01:20:36,186
If she stays unconscious for too long,
she'll stop breathing.

992
01:20:36,187 --> 01:20:39,906
- Why wasn't it kept locked up?
- You know perfectly well that it was.

993
01:20:39,907 --> 01:20:43,226
Now, leave her to me,
and go and telephone for an ambulance.

994
01:20:43,227 --> 01:20:45,227
Now.

995
01:20:48,307 --> 01:20:50,307
Please don't let her...

996
01:20:51,027 --> 01:20:53,027
I won't.

997
01:21:07,027 --> 01:21:10,146
- You'll just have to be patient, Mr Spence.
- It'll only take a moment.

998
01:21:10,147 --> 01:21:12,546
Let them do their job.
You heard what the doctor said.

999
01:21:12,547 --> 01:21:16,067
- I need to speak with her.
- Later. You've done everything you can.

1000
01:21:17,818 --> 01:21:20,354
- How is she?
- She's going to be all right. 

1001
01:21:20,366 --> 01:21:21,728
Johnny found her in time.

1002
01:21:21,747 --> 01:21:23,947
- Thank God.
- Do they know what happened?

1003
01:21:24,827 --> 01:21:27,707
- No, not really. How is everyone?
- Yes, gone at last.

1004
01:21:28,547 --> 01:21:30,867
I don't think anyone
suspected anything.

1005
01:21:31,067 --> 01:21:34,306
- Do you know, I just saw something rather odd.
- What's that?

1006

That artist...

1007
01:21:35,972 --> 01:21:38,085
Do you remember, we met her together,
the one from France?

1008
01:21:38,108 --> 01:21:39,400
What about her?

1009
01:21:39,423 --> 01:21:42,866
I just saw her in reception.
She looked terrible, like she'd been in a fight.

1010
01:21:42,867 --> 01:21:45,106
- Are you sure it was her?
- Yes, of course.

1011
01:21:45,107 --> 01:21:47,266
She's gone now.
That's what was so odd.

1012
01:21:47,267 --> 01:21:51,130
I asked the nurse where you were, she got up and left.
That's how I noticed her.

1013
01:21:51,153 --> 01:21:52,727
Oh, God...

1014
01:21:52,747 --> 01:21:54,918
- What? What's the matter?
- Can I take your car?

1015
01:21:54,942 --> 01:21:56,480
- Of course.
- Stay with Frances.

1016
01:21:56,503 --> 01:21:59,986
Don't leave her alone with anybody,
and I mean anybody, not even... me.

1017
01:21:59,987 --> 01:22:01,987
I'll be back as quick as I can.

if you came back.

1020
01:22:47,034 --> 01:22:48,385
- Wait, please.
- Why?

1021
01:22:48,408 --> 01:22:50,882
Because I'm not Johnny.
There are two of us. We...

1022
01:22:50,883 --> 01:22:54,722
He's someone I met and we swapped places
because of the way we looked,

1023
01:22:54,723 --> 01:22:56,723
and I know that sounds absurd.

1024
01:23:05,843 --> 01:23:07,843
You are the ticklish one.

1025
01:23:09,883 --> 01:23:13,242
Yes, I suppose I am, although that might be
hard to prove at the moment.

1026
01:23:13,243 --> 01:23:16,162
I knew you were different
the moment you touched me,

1027
01:23:16,163 --> 01:23:18,282
but I did not believe
it was possible.

1028
01:23:18,283 --> 01:23:21,163
I didn't mean to deceive you.
Is that because of me?

1029
01:23:22,963 --> 01:23:24,963
No, because of me.

1030
01:23:25,563 --> 01:23:28,403
- I'll survive.
- Do you know where he is?

1031
01:23:29,203 --> 01:23:32,083
He just tried to kill my...
He tried to kill Frances.

1032
01:23:33,123 --> 01:23:35,123
I need to find him.

1033
01:23:35,643 --> 01:23:37,643
He went to his foundry last night.

1034
01:23:39,603 --> 01:23:41,642

Who are you really?

1038
01:23:51,643 --> 01:23:56,083
A mother.
I had to leave my child behind when I fled.

1039
01:23:58,723 --> 01:24:00,843
I think it's time to go home.
Don't you?

1040
01:24:02,643 --> 01:24:04,923
I'm not sure I know
where home is any more.

1041
01:24:06,563 --> 01:24:08,563
Don't worry, you will.

Mr Standing...

1044
01:24:51,323 --> 01:24:54,603
You'll have to excuse me.
I'm just finishing a rather primitive supper.

1045
01:24:56,243 --> 01:24:58,363
You look quite
the country gentleman.

1046
01:24:59,963 --> 01:25:02,002
So, how did you find me?

1047
01:25:02,003 --> 01:25:04,003
Bella.

1048
01:25:04,483 --> 01:25:06,883
Of course. You have been busy,
haven't you?

1049
01:25:07,883 --> 01:25:11,722
Yes. I'm afraid I lost my temper with her,
but you can hardly blame me.

1050
01:25:11,723 --> 01:25:15,123
You've taken our little experiment
further than I expected.

1051
01:25:16,683 --> 01:25:19,203
Your effect on Frances
was quite remarkable.

1052
01:25:20,923 --> 01:25:23,843
I don't think I've ever
been kissed like that before.

1053
01:25:24,523 --> 01:25:27,722
I congratulate you. You certainly
made everything much easier for me.

1054
01:25:27,723 --> 01:25:31,362
- What did you do to her?
- I didn't have to do anything, thanks to you.

1055
01:25:31,363 --> 01:25:35,563
She's always been very persuadable, but,
of course, you already know that.

1056
01:25:35,803 --> 01:25:38,883
I can't blame you.
I'd have done the same. In fact, I did.

1057
01:25:41,043 --> 01:25:43,123
I assume you're here
about the money.

1058
01:25:43,888 --> 01:25:45,438
Don't worry, you'll get your share.

1059

Frances's father is a very rich man.
I can afford to be generous.

1060
01:25:48,603 --> 01:25:50,963
There is no money.
She's not dead.

1061
01:25:52,723 --> 01:25:55,802
Not possible. I gave her enough to kill a cow,
appropriately enough.

1062
01:25:55,803 --> 01:25:58,683
I want you to go away
and leave her alone.

1063
01:26:00,723 --> 01:26:02,723
Oh.

1064
01:26:03,883 --> 01:26:05,883
So you want it all, do you?

1065
01:26:07,323 --> 01:26:10,242
That's a little greedy,
but no more than I expected.

1066
01:26:10,243 --> 01:26:12,882
You've become almost as
good at being me as I am.

1067
01:26:12,883 --> 01:26:14,922
- I'm serious.
- Yes. So am I.

1068
01:26:14,923 --> 01:26:18,403
Now, take off those clothes.
We're going to have to change back.

1069
01:26:21,683 --> 01:26:23,722
- No.
- I mean it!

1070
01:26:23,723 --> 01:26:26,723
I don't need you. I need my clothes.
Now, take them off.

1071
01:26:29,483 --> 01:26:31,483
So you're going to kill us both?

1072
01:26:31,963 --> 01:26:35,282
- Was that always your plan?
- God, no. Do I look like an idiot?

1073
01:26:35,283 --> 01:26:39,083
I never even thought you'd make it to the house,
let alone into my bed.

1074
01:26:39,443 --> 01:26:43,072
No. I had you bleating your unlikely story
to a baffled country policeman

1075
01:26:43,096 --> 01:26:45,561
then being sent on your way.

1076
01:26:45,585 --> 01:26:48,602
But I did get curious,
so I rang the house after a couple of days.

1077
01:26:48,603 --> 01:26:53,162
When Charlie answered and said I was out,
but would be back in an hour,

1078
01:26:53,163 --> 01:26:55,363
I realised the walls
had been breached,

1079
01:26:55,883 --> 01:26:57,922
and I had the perfect opportunity.

1080
01:26:57,923 --> 01:27:00,242
You're not the only one.

1081
01:27:00,243 --> 01:27:03,443
This last week has been
the most extraordinary of my life,

1082
01:27:04,483 --> 01:27:07,243
and I love your family,
every single one of them.

1083
01:27:08,123 --> 01:27:10,643
- You have no idea how lucky you are.
- Oh, God...

1084
01:27:11,523 --> 01:27:14,162
You are pathetically sentimental.

1085
01:27:14,163 --> 01:27:17,282
My family are too selfish
to love anyone but themselves.

1086
01:27:17,283 --> 01:27:20,803
I've lived long enough with them to know that.
Now, would you hurry up?

1087
01:27:21,323 --> 01:27:23,362
What will you do with me?

1088
01:27:23,363 --> 01:27:25,402
Ashes to ashes and all that.

1089
01:27:25,403 --> 01:27:27,443
There'll be no trace of you
by morning.

1090
01:27:55,363 --> 01:27:56,723
(GUNSHOT)

1091
01:29:20,883 --> 01:29:24,763
FRANCES: Darling, what happened?

1092
01:29:25,923 --> 01:29:27,923
I've had such terrible dreams.

1093
01:29:31,483 --> 01:29:33,483
You're safe.

1094
01:29:37,003 --> 01:29:39,003
Have I disappointed you again?

1095
01:29:42,763 --> 01:29:44,763
You've never disappointed me.

1096
01:29:46,803 --> 01:29:49,723
You're the most extraordinary person
I've ever met,

1097
01:29:51,003 --> 01:29:53,803
and I'll never forget a moment
I've spent with you,

1098
01:29:55,443 --> 01:29:59,643
and, whatever happens,
I want you to know that I love you.

1099
01:30:00,403 --> 01:30:02,442
What's the matter?

1100
01:30:02,443 --> 01:30:04,482
You're shaking.

1101
01:30:04,483 --> 01:30:07,323
Don't worry about me.
Just rest.

1102
01:30:08,363 --> 01:30:10,363
Rest and get strong.

1103
01:30:10,603 --> 01:30:12,603
Sleep.

1104
01:30:39,163 --> 01:30:41,163
You've changed.
Do you know that?

1105
01:30:44,083 --> 01:30:46,083
Have I?

1106
01:30:50,563 --> 01:30:52,602
I don't know.

1107
01:30:52,603 --> 01:30:54,642
You seem harder.

1108
01:30:54,643 --> 01:30:56,643
To me at least.

1109
01:30:58,763 --> 01:31:00,763
You never loved me at all,
did you?

1110
01:31:03,203 --> 01:31:05,203
I don't think I did.

1111
01:31:05,763 --> 01:31:07,802
So you have changed.

1112
01:31:07,803 --> 01:31:09,803
You don't even pretend any more.

1113
01:31:11,483 --> 01:31:13,483
Paul wants to take me abroad.

1114
01:31:14,323 --> 01:31:16,362
France, Italy, everywhere.

1115
01:31:16,363 --> 01:31:18,883
He's suddenly full of ideas
for the business.

1116
01:31:19,843 --> 01:31:22,963
- He thinks I can help him.
- I think that would be very good.

1117
01:31:23,843 --> 01:31:25,843
- Really?
- Yes.

1118
01:31:26,505 --> 01:31:28,384
Well, I've never travelled.

1119
01:31:28,408 --> 01:31:31,202
I've never been anywhere,
what with the war and everything.

1120
01:31:31,203 --> 01:31:33,203
I'm terrible at languages.

1121
01:31:34,523 --> 01:31:37,523
- What use would I be to him?
- You'd be just what he needs.

1122
01:31:38,283 --> 01:31:41,043
You looked so strong together today
at the lunch.

1123
01:31:42,563 --> 01:31:44,563
He really loves you.
You know that?

1124
01:31:50,043 --> 01:31:52,523
I'm still bloody furious with you,
you know.

1125
01:31:54,243 --> 01:31:56,243
I know.

1126
01:31:56,923 --> 01:31:59,123
- Stay with her.
- Of course.

1127
01:32:12,403 --> 01:32:14,403
- She's asleep.
- Where are you going?

1128
01:32:16,923 --> 01:32:19,683
To see Mary Lou. I made a...
I made a promise.

1129
01:32:20,843 --> 01:32:22,843
Frances will be all right.

1130
01:32:23,243 --> 01:32:25,243
Yes, I know.

1131
01:32:26,283 --> 01:32:29,763
I don't think I knew what it meant to
have a brother until today.

1132
01:32:31,283 --> 01:32:33,323
Thank you.

1133
01:33:16,003 --> 01:33:18,003
How is Frances?

1134
01:33:19,483 --> 01:33:21,483
Better. Sleeping.

1135
01:33:22,523 --> 01:33:24,523
I read the note she left.

1136
01:33:26,003 --> 01:33:28,003
She must have felt so alone.

1137
01:33:29,923 --> 01:33:32,643
It made me think about
what you said about Alice,

1138
01:33:33,683 --> 01:33:35,683
having no-one to turn to.

1139
01:33:38,163 --> 01:33:40,163
You're right.

1140
01:33:41,883 --> 01:33:43,883
When it mattered, we all failed her.

1141
01:33:45,483 --> 01:33:47,483
Including me.

1142
01:33:49,283 --> 01:33:51,283
I've decided to accept your offer.

1143
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:54,043
- You'll take over the foundry?
- Yes.

1144
01:33:54,883 --> 01:33:57,603
- I'm glad.
- There would be a condition.

1145
01:33:57,883 --> 01:34:00,563
- Anything.
- That you never set foot there again.

1146
01:34:02,043 --> 01:34:05,123
- Paul and I will be in charge.
- I completely agree.

1147
01:34:06,363 --> 01:34:08,402
What will you do about finance?

1148
01:34:08,403 --> 01:34:10,803
Come on, there has to be
something here we can sell.

1149
01:34:37,203 --> 01:34:40,483
She's asleep.
Please don't wake her up.

1150
01:35:10,483 --> 01:35:12,483
Eep-eep.

1151
01:35:15,923 --> 01:35:17,923
Good night, Mr Rabbit.

1152
01:35:28,083 --> 01:35:30,122
Tell me what she saw this afternoon.

1153
01:35:30,123 --> 01:35:33,523
I said you were helping her mother.
That's what she believes.

1154
01:35:35,363 --> 01:35:37,363
Thank you.

1155
01:35:37,563 --> 01:35:39,603
But it wasn't you she saw,
was it?

1156
01:35:45,123 --> 01:35:47,162
What do you mean?

1157
01:35:47,163 --> 01:35:49,202
I know Johnny better than anyone.

1158
01:35:49,203 --> 01:35:51,203
He loved me.

1159
01:35:52,003 --> 01:35:56,403
In his way, but as he grew older,
I faded like a photograph.

1160
01:35:57,843 --> 01:35:59,843
I became invisible to him.

1161
01:36:01,363 --> 01:36:04,323
But he wasn't to me.
I saw everything that he did.

1162
01:36:05,883 --> 01:36:07,883
And then something changed.

1163
01:36:09,723 --> 01:36:11,723
The child sensed it.

1164
01:36:12,443 --> 01:36:14,443
Said you smelt different.

1165
01:36:15,443 --> 01:36:17,443
I didn't believe it at first,

1166
01:36:17,923 --> 01:36:20,723
but, this afternoon,
when you found her on the bed,

1167
01:36:21,843 --> 01:36:23,922
I saw your face.

1168
01:36:23,923 --> 01:36:25,923
Then I was sure.

1169
01:36:37,563 --> 01:36:39,562
I'm leaving.

1170
01:36:39,563 --> 01:36:43,527
I came back because
I made a promise

1171
01:36:43,538 --> 01:36:47,131
I would tell Piglet first
if I ever had to go away.

1172
01:36:47,443 --> 01:36:50,923
Please tell her one day
that I tried to keep it.

1173
01:36:52,763 --> 01:36:54,763
Is he coming back?

1174
01:36:55,843 --> 01:36:57,843
- No.
- Ever?

1175
01:36:59,203 --> 01:37:01,243
- No.
- Then why are you leaving?

1176
01:37:03,763 --> 01:37:05,763
This isn't my house.

1177
01:37:06,283 --> 01:37:08,323
- It isn't my family.
- Isn't it?

1178
01:37:10,203 --> 01:37:12,923
This Princess Elizabeth
wasn't meant to be queen

1179
01:37:13,563 --> 01:37:15,963
any more than her father
was born to be king.

1180
01:37:16,704 --> 01:37:19,824
Sometimes,
nature or fate take the decision.

1181
01:37:21,144 --> 01:37:23,144
Perhaps it will be the making of us.

1182
01:37:47,363 --> 01:37:49,402
(PING-PONG BALL BOUNCING)

1183
01:37:49,403 --> 01:37:53,323
PIGLET: Five, six, seven, eight.

1184
01:37:58,283 --> 01:38:00,283
Very good!

1185
01:38:12,563 --> 01:38:14,603
(LAUGHTER)

1186
01:38:15,843 --> 01:38:17,843
Ooh...

1187
01:38:18,843 --> 01:38:20,843
Are you all right?

1188
01:38:22,483 --> 01:38:24,562
You need to be careful
in your condition.

1189
01:38:24,563 --> 01:38:26,803
I'm fine, just a little out of breath,
that's all.

1190
01:38:28,203 --> 01:38:30,243
Come on! It's about to begin.

1191
01:38:31,723 --> 01:38:34,683
George! Charlotte! Annie! Everyone!

1192
