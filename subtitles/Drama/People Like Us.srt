1
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:09,758
Are we on?
We're on.

2
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:11,427
Where we at
with the levels?

3
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,012
Left.
Right.

4
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:15,097
l'm getting a little
hum from the guitar amp.

5
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,932
You like it with
that sort of gutbucket sound.

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,183
I want to be
convertible on this.

7
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,394
l want to be able to switch it
back if it doesn't fit.

8
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,104
Check, check. Check.
That's good.

9
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,981
Jerry,
we're ready now.

10
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:26,108
Groovy, man. Let's go.
Yeah, man.

11
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,627
Sleep all day
Out all night

12
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,255
l know where you're goin'

13
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,966
l don't think
that's actin' right

14
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,969
You don't think
it's showin'

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,098
So these are your P30 tires, huh?
That's right.

16
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,433
-How many?
-A hundred thousand.

17
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:00,517
A hundred thousand?

18
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,643
God, that's a mountain
of rubber, Ben.

19
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,312
Please don't tell me you're
offloading to a liquidator.

20
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,480
-We use Cemensky Brothers.
-Cemensky Brothers?

21
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,522
Look, l'm kind of
pressed for time.

22
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,690
Can you get to the point?

23
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,358
What, for 10 cents
on the dollar?

24
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,735
Two percent
of your wholesale cost?

25
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,403
What happens when
they dump 100,000 P30s

26
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,614
to every discount chain that's
competing for your clients?

27
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:17,201
Okay. Ten minutes.
Bottom line it for me. What's your cut?

28
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,078
Well, l could pay you
100 cents on the dollar,

29
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,704
your full wholesale cost,

30
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,331
guarantee to
re-market overseas

31
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,707
so you don't undercut
domestic sales,

32
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,334
and for that, believe me,

33
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,252
it's a river of shit
you don't want to go swimming in,

34
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,088
we only pull 30%. commission.

35
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,173
What is it you do again?
You buy tires?

36
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,466
Among other things, yeah.

37
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,427
l work in corporate barter.
l'm a facilitator.

38
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,721
Thank you so much
for taking the time.

39
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,640
Sam Harper,
Allied Trade Consultants.

40
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:41,183
We buy and sell overstock.

41
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:44,728
lt's the barter system, Omar.
The original form of commerce.

42
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,313
Look, every company
has leftovers

43
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,523
after a sales cycle, right?

44
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,774
Last year's electronics,

45
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,442
ketchup bottles,
kitten calendars,

46
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,902
toys that didn't sell
at Christmas.

47
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,403
Anything with
an expiration date.

48
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,780
Questionable baby formula.

49
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,615
There's a market
for everything, Phil.

50
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,534
Weyerhaeuser Paper,
U.S. Steel,

51
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,202
Exxon Mobil, Fortune 500s.

52
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,286
We work for the biggest
in the world.

53
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,412
Do you have my card?

54
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,748
Because in this economy,
paper is paper,

55
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,834
but goods are good.

56
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,753
Unlike the dollar,
barter does not depreciate

57
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,214
one single percent.

58
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,257
lt's the new money.

59
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,424
l mean, that's how
you have to think of it.

60
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:18,720
You are getting in
on the ground floor of money!

61
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,478
All right.

62
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:28,730
Allied Trade Consultants?

63
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,399
Allied Trade
and Barter, please hold.

64
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,441
Allied Trade Consultants.

65
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,526
Please hold
while l transfer your call.

66
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,528
-Sammy!
-What's up, baby?

67
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,323
-Oh, he's leaving.
-Uh-huh. Okay.

68
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,616
l closed Lincoln Tire,

69
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,286
a million, two,
in product. Yes!

70
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,412
Yeah,
l'll make it right.

71
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,455
You should've seen me
in there, buddy. lt was a thing of beauty!

72
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,540
l fed him
your "new money" line.

73
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,458
lt was like feeding a baby
a pacifier.

74
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:51,336
Did you ship 100,000 cases
of tomato bisque to Ecuador?

75
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,422
Yeah. Yeah, National Soup had
overstock they had to dump.

76
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,548
And you shipped by train?

77
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,425
Of course l did.
lt was half as much as air freight.

78
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,553
Through Mexico.
115 degrees and you ship by train.

79
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,430
-What... What's the problem?
-The problem?

80
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:02,639
l'll tell you the problem.

81
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:03,724
Did you get Dolores
on the phone yet?

82
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,100
Yes. Here's the list.
She'll be very happy.

83
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,435
Thank you.
lt's all about Dolores.

84
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,477
l don't know
why you have to

85
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,190
l'm the best guy
you have on the floor. l'm a killer.

86
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,316
Am l saving you
too much money?

87
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,483
Yeah,
you're saving me money

88
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,486
by shipping boxes
of soup in an unrefrigerated train car.

89
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,156
-No, no, Jim, they were cans.
-No, they were boxes.

90
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,866
l know specifically
that they were boxes

91
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,118
because when
boxes get hot, they expand,

92
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,578
and when they expand
they explode,

93
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,788
and that train car
looked like a birthing suite at Bellevue.

94
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,498
Shit!

95
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,167
-You know what you did?
-This isn't a big deal, Jim.

96
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,294
You violated nine provisions

97
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,462
of the Sanitary Food
Transportation Act.

98
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,255
l get it, Jim.
Will you listen to me for a second?

99
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,840
And as soon as the Federal
Trade Commission finds out

100
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,508
they're going to shove
a flashlight,

101
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,719
a Klieg light, in my anus!
They're gonna put a light.

102
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,137
Jesus Christ!
Wanna keep it down?

103
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,222
Yeah, they're gonna
shine it up there

104
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,431
because they want
to shut us down!

105
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,682
You know they want
to shut us down!

106
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,310
We barter.
We don't pay taxes!

107
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,603
l will go
down to National,

108
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,146
l'll talk to Phil Hymore,
the VP of Sales...

109
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,522
-He loves me. l'll have...
-l talked to Phil Hymore.

110
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,650
Phil Hymore's the one
who's threatening to call the FTC.

111
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:55,859
Phil Hymore's
not calling the FTC.

112
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,402
Yeah, he knows he has us
over a barrel.

113
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,487
l'll throw him a deal

114
00:03:58,529 --> 00:03:59,529
and corrugate it
for his next shipment.

115
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,366
He does not want corrugated.
Phil Hymore wants an addition.

116
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,492
-An addition?
-To his house.

117
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:04,660
He wants an addition
to his house.

118
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:05,911
He's got a new wife,
Dolores.

119
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,496
She doesn't like
the master suite.

120
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:10,332
Smells his ex in the walls or
something. Do l give a shit?

121
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,501
Are you telling me
you're bribing Phil Hymore

122
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:13,835
not to report us
to the FTC

123
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,837
by buying him
an addition to his house?

124
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,673
For the record,
l did not use that word, okay?

125
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,799
You're a genius! Genius!

126
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,384
You moved, what,
two million of Lincoln Tire?

127
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,510
Yeah.

128
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,262
What's that
in commission, about 80K?

129
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,346
Eighty-four.

130
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,389
Eighty-four thousand.

131
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,640
That should
just about cover it.

132
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,185
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
No, no, don't do that to me.

133
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,937
Jim, that's my year!
That's my nut, man!

134
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,564
Technically it's not yours, it's
mine. Read your contract.

135
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,192
Commissions are discretionary,
which means it's up to me.

136
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:40,404
Jim, l need this money.
l need this money.

137
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:43,198
You need? l need.
My two ex-wives need.

138
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,783
My son in rehab needs.

139
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,536
Which is why you need to
get everything on this list.

140
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,371
That's lumber, copper,
conduit, piping,

141
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,706
everything, all right?

142
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,041
Call your vendors.
You got three days. Cut a deal.

143
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,585
Let's see
a little ingenuity, okay?

144
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,755
Get me the shit on that list,
otherwise your ass is fired!

145
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,382
l'm not kidding!

146
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,647
Shit!

147
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,029
Hannah?

148
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,406
l got to bail
on Kim's dinner thing.

149
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,991
l need
a horse tranquilizer.

150
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:31,872
Why are you cooking?

151
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,041
You wouldn't
answer your phone.

152
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,501
What's... What's wrong?

153
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,712
Your mom's been
trying you all day.

154
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,550
Your dad died.

155
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:48,722
l'm so sorry.

156
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,851
What's for dinner?

157
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,367
Annie. Sam Harper,
Allied Trade. How are you?

158
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,452
l'm in a bind.
l'm leaving town for a couple days.

159
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,745
l was just hoping
you could help me out.

160
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,789
Get a pen.
l'm gonna give you a list of all the stuff...

161
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,874
Yeah...
No, l'm sure you are busy,

162
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,751
but l happen to be in the
market for a little lumber.

163
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,753
-Next in line, please?
-l know... l got to run.

164
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,296
What do you mean
there's a lumber shortage

165
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,631
-in the northeast?
-Sam... Okay?

166
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:23,757
lf you help me out
with this wood,

167
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,008
l will get
your truck fleet...

168
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,551
Sir, we need
your photo lD, please.

169
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,428
l'll call you
when l land. Bye.

170
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,554
-Sorry about that.
-That's okay.

171
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,972
-l just need your picture lD.
-Yeah, sure.

172
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:38,939
What?

173
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,526
l left it on the table
while l was packing.

174
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,319
Sir, we can't let you board
the plane without lD.

175
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,029
lt is my father's funeral.
Tonight.

176
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,406
lt's a family emergency.

177
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,824
lf you go over to TSA, they can help you.

178
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,367
l can't go to TSA...

179
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,452
Nope,
that gets in too late.

180
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,579
ls there anything
that gets into L.A. tonight?

181
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,541
Listen, l just
need you to be a person right now.

182
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,917
We are trying
to get to a funeral.

183
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,503
Yes. Uh-huh. Okay.
What about going through...

184
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,796
Come on. Let's go.

185
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,506
What time
does that get in?

186
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,508
Okay, let me just get
a pen out of the glove compartment.

187
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,968
There are still
seats available?

188
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,095
No, that's great.
And when does that leave?

189
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,471
l don't know
if we can make that,

190
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,806
but let me just
write that down.

191
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,143
Oh, my God!
Baby, look!

192
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,894
-Oh, my God!
-lt was on the floor.

193
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,980
Hang on. lt must have
fallen under the seat.

194
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,482
Yeah, it must have
fallen out of my...

195
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,733
We can go.
We can go right now.

196
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,653
No! She said that
was the last flight.

197
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,029
No, no, no.
l'm talking to her now.

198
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,614
She said there's a flight,
it goes through Denver.

199
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,699
We'll get there late.
lt'll be close,

200
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,992
but we'll get there.
What's...

201
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,118
Yeah, well, then,
let's do it.

202
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,453
-Great! Okay.
-Thank you.

203
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:38,582
l'll give you the number
right now. lt is 5184,

204
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,042
3801 , 2373...

205
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,381
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

206
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,842
l'd like to welcome everyone
on flight 86A to Los Angeles.

207
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,553
We are currently cruising at
an altitude of 33,000 feet

208
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,805
at an air speed of
about 400 miles an hour.

209
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,433
Weather looks good, and with
the tailwind on our side...

210
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,018
l'll be right back.

211
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,464
Well, he's not here.

212
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,474
Friends,
thank you all for coming.

213
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,600
We all knew Jerry...

214
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,470
Hey, Mom.

215
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,393
Okay,
l'm going to take off.

216
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,981
-Love you, sweetie.
-Okay. Love you. Thanks.

217
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,315
-Hi, Sheila.
-Hello, Sam.

218
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,988
-You get my message?
-Oh, yeah, the airlines.

219
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,698
They wouldn't even let me
on the plane.

220
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,908
Yeah, just the way it is
these days.

221
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:37,993
Yeah.

222
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,830
Mom, this is, uh, Hannah.

223
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,207
l'm so sorry.

224
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,965
Now l have a face
to the voice.

225
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,341
Beautiful face.

226
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,219
How can l help?
What do you need me to do?

227
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,929
l could clean,
l could do anything.

228
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,140
-How long are you staying?
-We got to get back tomorrow.

229
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,850
Hannah's got
a law school interview.

230
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,894
Wow! Law school.
Your parents must be proud.

231
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,857
-Where do they live?
-Chicago.

232
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,859
-You get home to them much?
-Mom...

233
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,946
l'm gonna go unpack.

234
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,493
He would've liked her.

235
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,503
Mom, l...

236
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,056
The linens are in
the closet upstairs.

237
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,892
l'm glad you're home.

238
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,565
-What are you doing?
-lt fell.

239
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,277
"Hannah's got to get back
for an interview."

240
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,945
Really? lt's next week.

241
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:05,033
l know. l'm sorry.
l just didn't know what to say.

242
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,160
That's a first.

243
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,246
What is this,
his man cave?

244
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,208
More or less, l guess.

245
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:17,170
l don't think
l've been up here since l was like, eight.

246
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,213
Since you were eight?

247
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,339
He'd come in
and lock the door...

248
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,423
What do you mean,
"He locked the door"?

249
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,425
l am cold.
Are you cold?

250
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,552
No. Oh, my God,
is that Elvis Costello?

251
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:30,725
Uh, yeah, he gave him his
first pair of ugly glasses,

252
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,310
and, um, sort of
got Columbia to sign him.

253
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,229
He doesn't look like
how you described him.

254
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,940
l imagined this cold
Mr. Frost guy.

255
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,234
He's got kind of
a sweet face.

256
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,069
Yes, that's not
the guy l knew.

257
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,487
Come on.

258
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:46,241
lt's your dad!
You don't have one happy memory?

259
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,534
Yeah, one.

260
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,579
He used to take me
to this park on Sundays.

261
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,249
-That's nice.
-He never got out of the car.

262
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,543
He'd sit and watch me
so he could...

263
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,255
Listen to his demos.

264
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:03,424
But, hey, you know,
that's how he discovered Kajagoogoo,

265
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,260
so he did make
a major contribution

266
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,302
to the human race.

267
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,139
Hi, Sam, it's lke Rafferty,

268
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,975
your father's attorney.

269
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,477
l'd like to talk to you
about your father's estate.

270
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,979
l could meet you for lunch.

271
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,607
And maybe we should
keep this between us for now, okay?

272
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,139
Hey, lke, sorry l'm late.
Parking was a nightmare.

273
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,223
lt is, yeah.

274
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,517
-Been a long time, huh?
-lt has been a long time.

275
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,602
Wow, wow, wow.

276
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:58,146
l won't say you look
the same, you're taller,

277
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,607
but you do look
like your dad.

278
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,359
Yeah, look at you,
the Manhattans.

279
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,654
We used to have lunch
every Friday.

280
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,197
The four of us, right here.

281
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,074
-Same booth?
-Thirty-five years.

282
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,535
-Wow.
-l'm the last of the Mohicans.

283
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:14,829
So...

284
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,249
How about the will?

285
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,085
-The will is not complicated.
-Mmm-hmm.

286
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,963
Basically, the house and the furniture
go to your mom.

287
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,006
Mmm-hmm.

288
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,843
He left you his records.
Old vinyl. Pretty great stuff.

289
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,303
And the money?
And what about the money?

290
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,222
Well, you could probably
sell them for a lot.

291
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,016
l think he'd rather
that you listen to them

292
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,142
once in a while.

293
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,852
Get your groove back.

294
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,276
Get my groove back?

295
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,195
Because what happened
to my groove?

296
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,905
l knew l had it
here somewhere.

297
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,865
All right.
You're disappointed. l get it.

298
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,618
l am. l'm just
a little disappointed.

299
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,703
l'm a little disappointed.
You get it.

300
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,705
A week ago he asked me to
come see him at the house.

301
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,207
He gave me this.

302
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,627
lt's for you.

303
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,754
All l know is that
it's something

304
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,714
he said he was working on
for a long, long time.

305
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,967
He wanted you to have it.

306
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,303
His shaving kit.

307
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,224
Wow. That's great.
Did you open it?

308
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,768
No, l didn't open it.

309
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:25,191
Look, son.
l lent your father a suit

310
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,859
so that he could
marry your mother.

311
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,238
l never saw
that suit again.

312
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,407
And l got the bill
from the caterer.

313
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,702
That's the way it was
for 35 years.

314
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,665
l loved him anyway.

315
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,377
l hope you can, too.

316
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,923
-Thanks, Peggy.
-Thanks, doll.

317
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,879
Oh, my...

318
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,450
Yo, Josh, hold on.
Yo, dude, shut up.

319
00:17:58,786 --> 00:17:59,827
What is it?

320
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,329
Sodium from
the science lab.

321
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,831
This hits the pool,
it'll totally detonate.

322
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:07,168
-You mean it'll blow up?
-Yes. lt'll blow up.

323
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,754
-Bullshit.
-Dude, l'm telling you.

324
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,422
lt's a chemical. Watch.

325
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,313
-l told you noth...
-Whoa!

326
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,940
Oh, shit!

327
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,027
Shit! We got to go! Go!
Let's go, let's go!

328
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,281
Oh, my God,
that was awesome!

329
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,040
l know your mother.

330
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,132
Really?

331
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,884
l'm sure you deal
with your share of working moms,

332
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,177
more than your share,

333
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,138
so l know you understand.

334
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,014
Vandalism, Miss Davis.

335
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,852
lt's Frankie. Please.
And l know, it's my fault.

336
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,353
You are right
to think that.

337
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,106
l work in a bar.

338
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,774
So, l'm sure that
there's something

339
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:12,900
we can work out here.
Josh is...

340
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,026
There's nothing you can say

341
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,903
that has any relevance
to Josh's expulsion.

342
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,406
You're going to expel him.

343
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,950
What did you expect?
Your son blew up a pool.

344
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,119
l can't have him putting
other students in danger.

345
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,037
Frankly, l don't see
what more there is to talk about,

346
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,248
and l have another meeting,
if you don't mind.

347
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,333
There are some exit papers
l need you to sign.

348
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,420
Where did Josh
get the sodium?

349
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,923
Obviously
the science lab.

350
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,342
Oh, okay, so,
just so l don't misunderstand.

351
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,511
ls that the only
explosive material

352
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,597
you leave lying around
for students to play with?

353
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,473
Don't try
to shift the blame to his teachers.

354
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,392
Where did he learn
it would explode in water?

355
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,518
l don't care for your tone.

356
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,937
Your school's recklessness
nearly killed my son.

357
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,522
Good thing
he figured it out

358
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,232
before he lost an eye,
or a finger,

359
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,401
or a shitload of
Board of Ed. funding,

360
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,944
because some parent

361
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,990
might just be concerned enough to
go out and find a lawyer.

362
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,950
Like those tough
pro bono types

363
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,410
that hang out
in my bar at night

364
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,329
and stare at my, well...

365
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,458
l think you know
what l'm saying.

366
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,940
l have no idea
what you were thinking today.

367
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,192
Hey! Josh!
Are you even listening to me?

368
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,569
Joshua Alan Davis,
this is serious!

369
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,529
l mean, why couldn't you
shoplift or trespass?

370
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,490
Where you lose me
is explosives.

371
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,492
That's where l feel
like l'm not getting through to you.

372
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,868
Hey, are you
listening to me?

373
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,370
How am l going to
pay for that pool, huh?

374
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:48,996
A lemonade stand?

375
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,039
Oh, you think
you're the only one

376
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,123
who can act like
an 11-year-old?

377
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,167
l invented acting out
for attention.

378
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:56,170
And congratulations,
you got to go to see a shrink now.

379
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,006
She wants you to
fill out some workbook for your anger.

380
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,466
-No way, Carol!
-Yes way.

381
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,551
l'm not doing it, Carol.

382
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,929
Don't call me Carol!
My name is not Carol.

383
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,055
lt's Mom,
for once in your life.

384
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,640
No TV, no computer.

385
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,058
That's child abuse.

386
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,268
Yeah, well,
l can't wait for you

387
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,644
to tell your shrink about it!

388
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:24,031
Come on, monkey.
We both know you're smart.

389
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,242
l know you're listening
in science class.

390
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,003
Hey, Jenny,
can l call you back, please?

391
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,296
lt's a really
bad time right...

392
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,549
Whoa, whoa, wait.

393
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,718
No, what article?

394
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,563
No, l'm fine. l'm fine.

395
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,023
No, l'm...

396
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,069
Yeah. l'll go. l'm gonna go.
l'll go right now.

397
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,237
Thanks.

398
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,465
-Hey, Frankie. Sorry.
-Hey, Ted.

399
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:23,924
Do you have
yesterday's paper?

400
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,593
Yeah.
Let me grab it. This is yesterday.

401
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:29,430
Wow. You really need
that horoscope, huh?

402
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,601
So, l was going to get
some dinner at some point.

403
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:36,187
l don't know if you
have plans tonight, or...

404
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,149
-Hello? Frankie?
-Do you mind if l keep this?

405
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,692
No, of course not.
Go ahead.

406
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,612
-Hey, are you all right?
-Can you watch Josh for me?

407
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,572
For, like, an hour?
lt's the last time, l promise.

408
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,615
Absolutely.

409
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,575
l have this emergency
that l have to go, um...

410
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:50,659
Of course. Yeah.

411
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,661
And, you know,
sorry about the dinner thing. lt was...

412
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,121
-Yeah. We're going to.
-Whenever.

413
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,581
Thanks, Ted.
Okay.

414
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,678
Come on,
come on, come on.

415
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:17,269
No, no, no, no!
Come on!

416
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,272
You had a yellow light,
for Christ's sake. Go!

417
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,191
Come on! Come on! Move!

418
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:49,760
Now it's
a different story.

419
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,138
l'm not saying that
every day is a cakewalk,

420
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,180
but it's working.

421
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:55,182
l mean,
this program, it works.

422
00:23:56,143 --> 00:24:00,062
l'm a dumb,
antagonistic drunk

423
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:03,357
who fought this
from day one.

424
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:07,403
Surrender still sounds
like losing to me.

425
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:13,159
But l stuck around,
and l'm sober. Thanks.

426
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,453
All right.

427
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:19,248
Before we take a break,
does anyone have a burning desire?

428
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,836
Yeah. Hi. Hi.
Frankie, alcoholic.

429
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,629
Hi, Frankie.

430
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,882
Um...

431
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,634
l wasn't planning
on coming today. This isn't my, um...

432
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,637
l'm supposed
to be at work. At the bar.

433
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,514
Uh...

434
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:39,185
Temptation being
the mother of all tips.

435
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,352
Uh...

436
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,649
My son blew up a pool
at school today.

437
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,776
With salt.

438
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:52,907
And then l got a call
from my sponsor who...

439
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:55,701
That, uh...

440
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,247
"American record producer
Jerry Harper

441
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,208
"died in Los Angeles Tuesday

"after a long battle
with cancer.

"He was 63."

00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,675
Cancer.

445
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,470
Shit.

446
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,556
"From the mid-'70s
to mid-'80s,

447

"Harper was known as

"He is survived
by his wife and son."

451

So...

lt's official.

453
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,462
l don't exist.

454
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,464
Whoo-hoo!

455
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,259
l'm beginning to think the
editors at the L.A. Times

456
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,261
are even bigger pricks
than my dad was.

457
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:00,933
l feel numb. Nothing.

458
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,268
So...

459
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,479
Why is it that l want

460
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,524
five dirty martinis

461
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,277
and a lot of other stuff?

462
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,322
Just to cover up the...

463
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,995
Okay. Blah, blah.

464
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,999
So, that's...
That's all l got.

465
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,793
Thank you. Thanks for
all the other sharers.

466
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,338
Coffee and cigarettes
and onwards.

467
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,259
Okay.
Who's next?

468
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,447
Hi.

469
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:58,824
You new?

470
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:01,660
Knew what?

471
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:06,248
N-E-W, newcomer
to the meeting?

472
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:09,001
To the meeting.
No, no, no, no. No. l, um...

473
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,673
l started in Tarzana,

474
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,926
and then Culver City,

475
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:20,763
and Studio City
was too sceney,

476
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:21,972
but l heard great things
about this one.

477
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,933
-l move around a lot to...
-Stay anonymous?

478
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:27,770
lt's just... lt's...

479
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:29,730
That's funny. Anonymous.

480
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:35,653
That was a really
crazy share.

481
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,321
Oh. Yeah.

482
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:38,989
Do you have
another cigarette by any chance?

483
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:42,368
l'm trying the gum to quit,
but it's killing me.

484
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,577
Probably.

485
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:47,915
Oh, no.
lt's your last one.

486
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,833
Oh, that's cool.
l like to pretend

487
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,335
l didn't smoke
the whole pack.

488
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:54,546
Thanks.

489
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,384
Here. You know what?
lt's a little...

490
00:27:58,426 --> 00:27:59,468
My hands are cold
or something.

491
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:02,054
Just a little...
l have lady hands.

492
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,521
l'm...

493
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,399
l'm Sam.

494
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,359
Oh! There goes anonymous.

495
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:20,447
Frankie. Uh, welcome, Sam,
if you decide to stay.

496
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:23,784
And you need
to learn to let go of your toiletries, man.

497
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,119
lt's the third step.

498
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:46,724
Hey.

499
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,434
Where is she?

500
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,394
l'll assume that's an apology
and l didn't understand it.

501
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,520
ls she upstairs?
ls she asleep?

502
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:52,688
Yeah,
she's probably upstairs.

503
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:53,897
She's probably exhausted
after spending

504
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,107
the last eight hours

505
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,984
cleaning the house
with her son's girlfriend.

506
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:59,153
Where you been, Sam?
Did you have a nice day?

507
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,614
What is wrong with you?

508
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,367
What's going on?

509
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,994
Can l talk to you outside
for a second?

510
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,545
-Where did you get that?
-My dad.

511
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,006
Hundred and fifty
thousand dollars.

512
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,636
That he left to a woman
whose kid is my...

513
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,059
ln theory,
the kid is my nephew.

514
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,979
l don't understand.
How could you have a nephew?

515
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,731
You don't have
any brothers or sisters.

516
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,025
l do now!

517
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,866
At first l think
she's his mistress.

518
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,785
l mean, that makes complete
sense, knowing my father.

519
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,620
But then l look at her.

520
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:55,667
She has my father's eyes
and his nose, and she...

521
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:56,919
Sam.

522
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,879
How are you going
to tell your mom?

523
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:02,841
Surprise! You won
the golden ticket to the shit factory!

524
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,426
l mean,
you have to tell her.

525
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,594
l mean,
she has to know the truth

526
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:07,638
and she's gonna find out that
he left them this money.

527
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,223
Not if l don't
give it to them.

528
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,601
-No, you're not serious.
-Listen to me. l am very serious.

529
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,813
-lt's $150,000.
-l know.

530
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:17,856
That he left
in his shaving kit

531
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,526
for some alcoholic
love child. l mean...

532
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,362
-lt's for the kid.
-lt's for me! l'm his son!

533
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,531
l'm supposed to hand it over
with a smile on my face?

534
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,615
He waits
until he's dead

535
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:27,783
to tell me about
his secret family?

536
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,243
l can't tell her who l am.

537
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,911
There's no way
l'm telling her who l am.

538
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:34,248
l am buried, buried,
under a shit pile of debt, Hannah.

539
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,833
-What are you talking about?
-A shit pile of debt!

540
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,252
-We're in debt?
-No, no, we're not in debt.

541
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,878
There is no "we," Hannah.
There's no "we."

542
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,255
What do you mean
there's no "we"?

543
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:42,339
"l." l'm in debt.

544
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,632
l was gonna
get this commission

545
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:45,509
to help dig me out
but now Phil Hymore's new wife

546
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:46,635
needs an addition
to her deck...

547
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:47,761
When were you planning
on telling me

548
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:48,846
that there is no "we"?

549
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,640
ls there any part
of my life that is off-limits? Any?

550
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:52,808
Jesus!

551
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,019
l knew we shouldn't
have come out here.

552
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:02,943
Oh, my God.

553
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,447
The wallet.

554
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,366
What?

555
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,952
You hid the wallet
in the car

556
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,037
so you could avoid
coming out here.

557
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,376
What?
That's complete bullshit.

558
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,629
Yeah, yeah, it is, Sam.
lt is complete bullshit!

559
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:23,964
Will you
listen to yourself? Please listen...

560
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,299
Why did you even
bring me through that

561
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:26,967
ridiculous charade
at the airport?

562
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,010
Come on, Han!

563
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,469
Why did you even
get on the plane?

564
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,471
Because you found us
another flight!

565
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,477
Who the hell are you, Sam?

566
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,902
Hannah, l understand
that you're angry.

567
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,528
l would like to talk
to you about this.

568
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,196
l'm so sorry, sir.
Thank you.

569
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,782
-Hannah, l need you.
-Why do you need me?

570
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,492
What, you need
someone else you can lie to?

571
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:53,660
You don't have
enough suckers in your life, Sam?

572
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:54,745
No.

573
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,331
Goodbye.

574
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:58,415
Hannah...

575
00:31:58,499 --> 00:31:59,750
Just go.

576
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:36,078
ls Johnny there?
Johnny Dillon?

577
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,039
l'm looking for Natalia.

578
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,668
l'm Jerry Harper's son.
Jerry Harper.

579
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,587
Jesus Christ.

580
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,631
This is an odd question.

581
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,424
Do you have a daughter?
Frankie?

582
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,550
Hello?

583
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,617
Hey, you'd love this.

584
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,411
lt's for the young
working woman

585
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:20,414
struggling to maintain
a balance between her career

586
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,790
and her personal life.

587
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,667
At least
you think l'm young.

588
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,585
l can see the bags
under your eyes.

589
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,796
-You got to watch...
-Frances, Josh, l'm Amanda.

590
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,715
Hi! Uh, sorry we're late.

591
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,883
There was a ton
of traffic and stuff, so...

592
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,594
All right, little man,
we'll see you...

593
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:35,762
Why don't you
come in and join us?

594
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,180
Oh.

595
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,558
-All right.
-Sit wherever you like.

596
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,021
Hey, oh, ah, ah, ah.
Come on.

597
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,939
She said sit wherever
you want, so, uh...

598
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,107
She doesn't mean
her desk. Get out.

599
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:50,110
You know, today,
let's sit wherever we want.

600
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:01,788
Oh, that's my...
This is for me. Okay.

601
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:06,001
So, Josh,
l want you to know that

602
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:08,211
whatever you're feeling
right now, it's all right.

603
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,756
You can say whatever's on your
mind or nothing at all.

604
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,133
She doesn't
want to be here.

605
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,886
Yeah, but we have
to be here, so...

606
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,597
-Well, for now, Frances...
-Oh, Frankie. Gosh.

607
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,681
Frances...

608
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,641
Please, call me Frankie.

609
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,143
Frankie. Okay.

610
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,228
Why don't you tell me
good things about Josh.

611
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,647
ls this a trick question?

612
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,483
There are
no trick questions.

613
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,984
Just whatever
comes to mind.

614
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:34,154
Yeah, no,
l have a great kid, l have a great kid.

615
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:38,700
So, obviously,
he's very smart.

616
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:41,495
And he's very funny.

617
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,998
And, you know,
he was great right from the get-go.

618
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,166
He was a great baby.

619
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:50,170
He slept through the night,
you know, right away.

620
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,839
He really never cried.

621
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:55,133
Why do you think
that was?

622
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,010
l'm sorry.
Why do l think what was?

623
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,512
Why he never cried.

624
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:02,265
-Why do you think that was?
-l don't know yet.

625
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,184
Okay, well,

626
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:07,062
my insurance covers four
50 minute sessions here

627
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,605
and then
it's out of pocket,

628
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,524
so l'd love it
if you could figure it out.

629
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,526
And l don't know
how this usually works,

630
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:13,902
but l was thinking
we could start by

631
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,570
asking Josh some questions.

632
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:16,696
Great.

633
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:19,825
So, Josh,
why don't you tell us

634
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,201
how you feel
about being here.

635
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,286
l feel better already.

636
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:34,673
Ah!

637
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:37,884
-Oh, so you're still here.
-What?

638
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,725
Hannah still asleep?

639
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,728
She left.
She had to leave.

640
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,731
Oh. l thought you guys
were going together.

641
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:54,151
Looks like l have
to see some clients while l'm in town.

642
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:56,570
What for?

643
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,989
Oh, you know...

644
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:01,700
Our company
just did a deal

645
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,076
to donate
a million soccer balls

646
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,744
made out of
disaster relief packaging

647
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:05,787
to kids in the Sudan,

648
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:07,247
so we do the logistics.

649
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,091
So l figured
l'd stay around for a couple days,

650
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,593
if that's cool with you.

651
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,262
Stay as long as you like.

652
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,768
No, Andy was supposed to call
you about this two days ago.

653
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:31,229
About the wood, Bill.
About the wood!

654
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,148
lf l don't get
this guy's wife enough wood

655
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:34,566
to build a deck
in eight hours,

656
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,276
he's gonna report me
to the FTC.

657
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:39,613
Here's my list.
She wants Mangaris wood, okay?

658
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,781
lt needs to be
diamond-finished Mangaris.

659
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:44,117
Also, the barbecue
needs to be a...

660
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:48,163
Needs to be
a 48-inch Viking,

661
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:52,000
high-end stainless steel
with an infrared burner.

662
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,627
What's up, guys?

663
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,922
Bill, l'll call you back
in five minutes.

664
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,298
Did you tell anybody
we were at the pool with you?

665
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,591
No.

666
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:00,634
lf you say
anything about us,

667
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:01,927
we'll beat
the living shit out of you!

668
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:00,151
No.

669
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:02,737
You're not getting
10 feet out the door.

670
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:03,947
Look. Look!

671
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:08,201
You can't be stealing CDs.
Nobody even buys CDs anymore.

672
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,327
And it's a record store.

673
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,870
You can't shoplift
from a record store.

674
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,038
lt's like kicking
a dead man.

675
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,040
Do you work here?

676
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,960
Probably only
a matter of time.

677
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,254
l'm Sam.

678
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:22,716
l sort of know your mom.

679
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,802
You're not going
to tell her, are you?

680
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:28,221
That your taste
in music blows? l don't know. Maybe.

681
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:32,350
Look, this right here,
this is what you're looking for.

682
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,228
Dude, if you try
and grab my balls...

683
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:39,357
Whoa, whoa. What the fuck?
Try and grab your balls?

684
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,234
lf you even try,

685
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,194
l will bite
your finger off. l swear to God.

686
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,904
l totally get it.
Here you go.

687
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:46,865
Go ahead.

688
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,035
How do you know her?

689
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:53,079
We, you know,
met in a meeting.

690
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:56,291
-What step are you on?
-Eight.

691
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,001
-Make your list yet?
-Huh?

692
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:00,503
-Of people you screwed over?
-Oh, yeah.

693
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,757
lt's a long list.
l'll be on eight for a while.

694
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:04,883
You know the steps?

695
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,301
Carol has them
on the fridge.

696
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,927
-Who's Carol?
-Frankie.

697
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,054
Why do you call her Carol?

698
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,764
Carol's our fat-ass
building manager.

699
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,058
Has a moustache,
smells like deep-fried farts.

700
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,851
Frankie doesn't see
the resemblance.

701
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,019
l have to remind her.

702
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,104
-How old are you?
-Eleven.

703
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,939
What do 11-year-olds
do nowadays?

704
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:23,109
-l blew up a pool.
-What?

705
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:25,779
Yeah, l threw in
a sodium rock and it blew up.

706
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:26,946
Part of it.
The deep end.

707
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,323
Carol was pissed.

708
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:29,908
Now l have to go
to kid therapy

709
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,952
and play with blocks
till l cry.

710
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,497
All right.

711
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,998
Here we go.
Listen up.

712
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,376
You're going to start
with Gang of Four, okay?

713
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:43,088
Then you'll move
to The Buzzcocks.

714
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:46,174
Then Joy Division.
Then The Clash.

715
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,302
Finish up with Television.
ln that order.

716
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:51,846
You going to remember
that order?

717
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,473
Maybe.

718
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:56,893
All right. Here you go.

719
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,436
Pay for them.

720
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:12,117
Whoa! That's your car?

721
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,327
Sweet wheels, dude.
Give me a ride.

722
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,996
No, no.
Definitely not.

723
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,457
Come on, Music Man,
you're already super weird.

724
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,542
lt's not going to
get any weirder.

725
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,502
Look, can you just...
l got to go, man.

726
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,421
l got to go. l'm sorry.
Can you just...

727
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:26,172
Sorry.

728
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:30,385
All right!
Public transportation sucks ass!

729
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:47,444
Spanish songs
in Andalucia

730
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:50,405
The shooting sites
in the days of '39

731
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:53,450
Oh, please, leave
the vendetta open

732
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:57,579
-Your mom's not home?
-Work.

733
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:58,913
Huh.

734
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,082
Where?

735
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,126
That hotel downtown,
The Standard.

736
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:05,462
When, now?
Does she work nights?

737
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:08,923
She kind of works nights,
double shifts. Whatever.

738
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,885
She's not worried about you
being home by yourself?

739
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,928
Dude, l know how
to microwave pizza.

740
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:17,056
Plus, there's
Ted downstairs, Lucy next door.

741
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:19,893
Seventeen, Mexican.
Goes braless.

742
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,978
Owns a yoga DVD.
lt's win-win.

743
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,025
Oh. Don't forget this.

744
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,195
Your musical edification.

745
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:35,575
Gang of Four, The Buzzcocks,
Joy Division, The Clash,

746
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,368
finish up with Television.

747
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,287
But if you really
want to go number one with a bullet,

748
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:40,955
there's six things
you got to know.

749
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,040
Six things?

750
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,167
Maybe l'll tell you
one day.

751
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:48,922
Thanks for not
kidnapping me.

752
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:50,423
No sweat.

753
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,771
They're attracted to me

754
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:07,774
They come around like honey

755
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:09,275
'Cause l'm fly like a bee

756
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,236
Man, l got 'em all buzzin'

757
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:16,574
Buzzin', buzzin', buzzin'

758
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,287
When l come around
Round, round

759
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,914
They go

760
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,792
When l come around
Round, round

761
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,460
They go

762
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:30,255
When l step in your town
Town, town

763
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:32,507
They go

764
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:34,384
Yeah, it's going down

765
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:43,977
You failed, asshole.

766
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,478
You had three days
and you couldn't get wood?

767
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,897
Hymore called the FTC,
and l got them in the office

768
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,482
questioning the ethics
of our business.

769
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:52,652
We don't have
ethics in our business. Where are you?

770
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,445
Mr. Harper, this is Jane MacKenna

with the FTC Bureau
of Consumer Protection.

772

Thank you.

779
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,172
Hi.

00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,303
l'm your brother.

781
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,105
Hey, um...

782
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,189
Oh.

783

-Frankie.
-Mr. Anonymous.

784
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:34,444
-You work here.
-Are you following me?

785
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:37,572
No, l had a had
a work thing in the lobby downstairs

786
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,115
at 8:00 p.m. Just ended.

787
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:40,658
l thought l'd come up

788
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,035
and check out the view
and the pool.

789
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,119
Uh-huh.

790
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,537
You know when
people are lying

791
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,414
they tend to
over-invent details.

792
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:48,207
Uh...

793
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,376
-That was a joke.
-Caught again.

794
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:53,338
Which you took seriously,
because maybe you are lying.

795
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,675
Oh, no, no.
You shouldn't use maraschinos.

796
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,719
They're soaked in
artificial food dye.

797
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,095
Some people are allergic.

798
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,222
Most companies
switch to natural.

799
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,599
lt's my job.

800
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,643
Cherry activist?

801
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,394
No, l'm sort of
a facilitator.

802
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:10,521
You're a robot sent from
the future to kill me?

803
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,231
Uh, corporate barter.

804
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,651
You know, barter,
the original form of commerce.

805
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:17,445
"Hey, you're a goat shepherd.
Sweet, l'm a chicken farmer.

806
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:19,405
"l'll trade you
25 chickens for a goat."

807
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,032
Goats, huh?

808
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:22,450
ls your shift over?

809
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:25,244
Yeah... Um...

810
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,500
Can l get you something?

811
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,085
That they sell here?

812
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:36,422
No, no, no, no. Look...

813
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,257
l swear to you
on my life l'm not

814
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,760
and will never
hit on you, ever.

815
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,720
Wow, thank you.

816
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:45,098
l'm sure that was meant
to reassure me.

817
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:46,724
No, l'm just...
l'm sure you get hit on all the time.

818
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:47,767
l'm not one of those guys...

819
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,602
l'm in a relationship
right now, so...

820
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:52,605
Oh, that's so great for you.
What's his name?

821
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,276
Can l get a Coke?

822
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,907
Ah! That will be
25 chickens, please.

823
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,325
l'm all chickened out.

824
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,285
You can owe me.

825
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:10,456
Management used
to let us wear sneakers,

826
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:14,293
till they decided that
that was not upscale skank enough.

827
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:19,173
-l'm sorry about your dad.
-Do you remember...

828
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:20,466
-What?
-No, you.

829
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,801
-No, go ahead.
-No, you were saying.

830
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,511
-l'm sorry you were...
-No, you.

831
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:25,388
All right, me. Um...

832
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:26,639
l was just going to ask

833
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,641
if you ever go
to the meeting on Colfax.

834
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:31,310
No, l just...
l came out from New York.

835
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:33,146
Because for some reason
you seem,

836
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:37,567
l don't know... Familiar.

837
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:42,864
l'm really sorry
about your dad.

838
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:49,328
That's nice of you to say,
but don't be sorry.

839
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,747
He was a dick.

840
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,375
Why a dick?

841
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:56,669
Well, he bailed
when l was little.

842
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,671
Pretty much qualifies him
for dick status.

843
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,214
How old were you?

844
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:02,633
Uh...

845
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,552
l don't know, eight.

846
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,472
So, he was in your life
eight years?

847
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:08,848
You know
what l love to do

848
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:11,267
at the end of my
really long shift?

849
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:12,518
Talk about my childhood.

850
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:16,272
l'm sorry.
l didn't mean to pry.

851
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:23,529
My dad died, too, recently,
and, you know,

852
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:27,700
he wasn't exactly
a gem of a human being, either, so...

853
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:29,952
l've been there.

854
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:33,790
-Sorry.
-No, no.

855
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,875
God, you have no reason
to apologize.

856
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,211
l'm the one peppering you
with questions.

857
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:42,924
l'm gonna go.

858
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,509
Yeah, l don't want
to keep you. l'm sorry.

859
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:47,386
-Uh... Weird running into you.
-Yes.

860
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:49,305
-Maybe l'll see you around.
-Sure.

861
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,224
Okay.

862
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,352
l do owe you
those 25 chickens, so...

863
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:55,394
Yeah.

864
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:48,781
-Hi there.
-Hi.

865
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:50,950
Do you have a hard time
making friends

866
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,660
or connecting with people?

867
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:53,870
No.

868
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,538
Do you feel lonely sometimes?

869
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,290
-Hey, Lucy.
-Hey.

870
00:47:57,457 --> 00:48:00,626
Like you don't know how to
talk to anyone around you,

871
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,045
maybe even the people
in your own family.

872
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:10,511
Does it make you feel
frustrated? Sad? Angry?

873
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,723
Are there days
when you just wish

874
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,474
you could be
somewhere else,

875
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,310
or even someone else?

876
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:20,938
You may think you're
the only person out there

877
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,440
who feels these things.

878
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:28,905
But it's part of being human.
So welcome to people.

879
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:32,950
We're about to learn some
simple relaxation tools

880
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:36,495
to calm those angry
and frustrated feelings.

881
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:40,833
Ready? First,
accept the way you feel.

882
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:45,504
Try making a fist
with each hand, and then let go.

883
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:48,007
Can you feel the difference?

884
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:53,554
Second, find
a soothing activity to distract yourself.

885
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,933
Maybe it's playing
with your favorite toy,

886
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,601
or riding a bike.

887
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,521
-Hey.
-Hey.

888
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:07,777
Oh, shit!

889
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:11,530
Don't be disappointed
if you don't feel better right away.

890
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:13,866
lt takes time
to find a perfect fit.

891
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:15,701
-You want to watch TV?
-You know, my kid's

892
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:17,787
going to be up soon, so...

893
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:19,956
Yeah. Okay.

894
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,959
Now, counting
down from five,

895
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:26,087
let the relaxation
spread like a wave

896
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,880
through your whole body.

897
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:32,134
Five, four, three,

898
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:35,012
two, one.

899
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:36,597
You found his meds.

900
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,766
l believe so.

901
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:49,485
Oh, God.
l shouldn't have done this.

902
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:52,238
This is the medicine
for the nausea from the chemo.

903
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,407
lt's like...
l don't know what. lt's like

904
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,242
drinking altar wine.

905
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:57,785
Oh, wow.

906
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:01,580
You smell like your father.
Patchouli.

907
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:05,251
Oh, God.
That used to turn me on.

908
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:09,380
Oh, Mom. l'm not that stoned.
l will never be that stoned.

909
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:10,923
How did you
end up with him, anyway?

910
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,259
What do you mean?
You know we met at The Faces concert.

911
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:15,886
No, no, no. l mean, you're
you, and he wasn't exactly

912
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,596
the quarterback
of the football team.

913
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:20,933
-He was handsome.
-Mom. He was a warlock.

914
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:24,770
Don't laugh at me.

915
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:30,651
You have to understand
something, Sammy.

916
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:33,654
l was the hatcheck girl
at the Troubadour.

917
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:38,784
l was 17 years old,
and he was like...

918
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:42,705
The king of L.A.

919
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:45,458
He said l reminded him
of Joni Mitchell.

920
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,834
She's the reason
l moved here.

921
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,961
l heard her voice
on the radio,

922
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:53,299
and l said,
"Why can't that be me?"

923
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:54,800
l could sing.

924
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:58,054
Everybody said it.

925
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:04,602
So, l came here
and l met your dad

926
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:06,645
and then l met
Joni Mitchell.

927
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:07,855
Oh, man.

928
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:13,360
l met Linda Ronstadt
and Stevie Nicks.

929
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:19,325
And Lillian Cresbauer
from Nutley, New Jersey.

930
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:25,456
One night, we were
all sitting around joking and singing,

931
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,833
and Jerry pushed me
toward the piano

932
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:30,503
and said, "Get up there,
Lillian. They'll love you!"

933
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:33,589
Nobody had ears
like your dad. He knew.

934
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,927
He knew l was good.

935
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,514
For Nutley, New Jersey.

936
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:47,353
So, l sang.

937
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:51,023
After that l...

938
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:55,694
l never felt
like those people were my friends again.

939
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:05,704
Wow.
You never told me that.

940
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:07,748
Why would he do that?

941
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:08,958
l don't know.

942
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,545
He wasn't always
easy to understand.

943
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:13,712
You know your father.

944
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:18,676
What is not
to understand, Mom? He was a f...

945
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,011
He was a prick.

946
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:24,807
He humiliated you.

947
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:27,059
You want to know
what was humiliating?

948
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,854
l was the only one
at the funeral

949
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:31,689
sitting next to
an empty seat.

950
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:34,441
That was fun.
l didn't have to answer

951
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,443
any weird questions
about that one.

952
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:40,739
Oh, there's the sarcasm.
l remember that.

953
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,950
Yeah, well,
what you probably don't remember

954
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:45,661
is me changing
the plastic bags in his abdomen

955
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:47,538
every two hours
so his shit wouldn't leak.

956
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:49,456
Wow, Mom.

957
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,876
That was like a double twist
on the high degree

958
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:53,169
of difficulty
on that insult dive.

959
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:55,379
He was in and out
of the hospital for a year.

960
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,630
You never even called him.

961
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:58,591
He didn't want
me around, Mom.

962
00:52:58,633 --> 00:52:59,884
ls that what
you tell yourself?

963
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,927
And you let him
not want me around.

964
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,805
You came home
maybe four times in the last 13 years.

965
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,432
Usually to borrow money.

966
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:07,933
How is the T-shirt
business, anyway?

967
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:10,144
-Good night.
-That's right. Run away.

968
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:12,938
At least it's the one thing
you're consistent about.

969
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,774
You think you knew him?

970
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,902
You saw what
you wanted to see.

971
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,488
Can you really believe
l didn't know the man

972
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:22,740
l was married to?

973
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:29,788
Jane MacKenna again

974
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,540
from the Federal Trade
Commission, Mr. Harper.

975
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,000
This is my second call.

976
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:34,460
lf you're not in our
Manhattan offices

977
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:35,502
by the end of the week

978
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:36,795
to assist our investigation,

979
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:38,839
we'll be forced
to issue you a subpoena.

980
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,507
End of new messages.

981
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:52,645
We could tell her
we've been waiting here for 20 minutes

982
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:53,729
and the button didn't work.

983
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:55,481
So sorry we're late.

984
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,691
The pickup line at school
was a total disaster.

985
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:59,068
-No, it wasn't.
-Kind of was.

986
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:00,486
Kind of wasn't.

987
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,071
Can l talk to you
alone for a second?

988
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,494
When l first got sober,

989
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:09,787
l heard everyone
tell all the old-timers...

990
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,038
l'm embarrassed,
l'm ashamed.

991
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:12,623
l've been sitting here
listening to everyone.

992
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,208
Frankly, l think
you're all quite mad.

993
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:16,252
So, thank you all
for listening

994
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,671
and keep coming back.

995
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,675
-Good night, Frankie.
-Yeah, good night.

996
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:24,885
Oh, shit!

997
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:33,811
Pretty sure the purse was
designed to keep things

998
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:34,853
inside itself.

999
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:38,065
But l don't want to
mess up your process.

1000
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:42,861
l know what you're thinking.
"You again." Again.

1001
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,824
My last meeting.
l got to go back to New York.

1002
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:48,158
Thought l'd say goodbye.

1003
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,743
Cherry season
already, huh?

1004
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:51,996
Yeah.
Something like that.

1005
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,789
You know, it's...
Thank you.

1006
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:01,297
Assuming you've had
better days, huh?

1007
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:06,885
What gave it away?

1008
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:10,973
Shit, right before this
l got fired by my kid's therapist.

1009
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:15,602
ls it fired, do you think?
Or broken up with?

1010
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:16,729
What happened?

1011
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,106
l got caught in a lie.
l just...

1012
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:23,193
l was late, and l lied
about it in front of my kid.

1013
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,820
So...

1014
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:33,245
Look, l know
we don't really know each other at all,

1015
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:37,916
but you seem
like a really...

1016
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,211
Like a really
great person.

1017
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:45,758
l'm not a professional

1018
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,969
parent or whatever,

1019
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:52,848
but l'm pretty sure
there's no such thing

1020
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:54,350
as a textbook mom.

1021
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,646
Your kid's really lucky
to have you.

1022
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:03,776
Bye, Frankie.

1023
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,324
Wait!

1024
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:15,120
l mean...
You're leaving now?

1025
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:17,956
l mean, before it was okay,
but now...

1026
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,876
We should get a taco
or something.

1027
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,295
Really?

1028
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,923
-Or not. Never mind.
-Absolutely.

1029
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,883
Absolutely never mind?

1030
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,636
Absolutely tacos.

1031
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:34,807
l realized that

1032
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:38,394
l feel sorry for my clothes
that l don't wear,

1033
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:43,107
so l rearranged my closets
so the stuff from the back

1034
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:47,319
got moved to the front
so it could have more face time.

1035
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,322
-l'm nuts.
-That's crazy.

1036
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:53,283
ln high school
l was in a band called Technical Virgin.

1037
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:56,286
ln high school
l was on a team

1038
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:58,705
of technical virgins
called "cheerleaders."

1039
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:01,333
-No!
-l got kicked off the team.

1040
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,836
-Why?
-l wouldn't do lame cheers.

1041
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:06,046
lt's not good to have
the pompon girl be like,

1042
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:07,172
"This is bullshit!"

1043
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:08,382
Can you show me
a lame cheer?

1044
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:10,217
-l'm not doing any cheers.
-Come on.

1045
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:12,678
l know one cheer.
lt's from a Faith No More song.

1046
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:16,056
"Be aggressive.
Be-Be aggressive.

1047
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:19,059
"B-E-A-G-G-R-E-S-S-l-V-E."
Anybody?

1048
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:21,728
"Be aggressive.
Be-Be aggressive."

1049
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:25,691
Let me just recap.
So, you're losing and l am winning.

1050
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:28,193
No, l'm not. l'm very
competitive right now.

1051
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:29,862
You were in a shitty band.

1052
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,989
That's all you've brought
to this entire situation.

1053
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:33,699
You better come up
with something good.

1054
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:35,033
Wow.

1055
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,163
l lied to avoid a funeral.

1056
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:43,333
-l give that like a six.
-Six? Bullshit, six.

1057
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,962
Good lord,
it's like watching the nature channel.

1058
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:48,213
Don't watch me eat.

1059
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:51,717
Every spring, the wild
Frankie migrates to the...

1060
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,136
All right.
l'm going to finish you.

1061
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,346
l'm going to sweep the leg.
Here it comes. You ready?

1062
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,265
Yeah. Please. l'm ready.

1063
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:05,481
l was a bit of a nightmare

1064
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:08,275
when l got pregnant
with my kid.

1065
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:09,401
Mmm-hmm.

1066
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:12,404
l would you know,
wake up, drink,

1067
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:17,159
score, bump, get laid,

1068
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:21,121
pass out, rinse, repeat.

1069
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:27,294
No numbers.
No names. So...

1070
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:33,759
l have no idea
who my kid's dad is.

1071
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:40,390
And l still ended up
with my little munchkin

1072
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,478
and he saved my life.

1073
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:52,110
-Ta-da!
-l fold.

1074
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:54,947
You can't win this game
if you don't have kids.

1075
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:57,991
Speaking of folding,
l have to go do laundry. l'm sorry.

1076
00:58:58,117 --> 00:59:00,410
l don't want to intrude on
your laundering space, but...

1077
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:03,121
l would love
to not go to the laundromat by myself.

1078
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:04,957
So, sure.

1079
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:09,419
You ate
a lot of nachos.

1080
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,088
So what?
Not.

1081
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,464
Not an astronaut?
Why not?

1082
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:14,132
lt's not going
to be astronaut.

1083
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:16,218
l don't know.
ln another life,

1084
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:18,470
l could've been a landscape
architect or something.

1085
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:20,514
Why not this life?
Why another life?

1086
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:22,516
You need a degree
or something.

1087
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:24,393
Why not do that now?

1088
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,228
l barely made it through
school the first time.

1089
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,147
Yeah, well, l shouldn't be
doling out career advice.

1090
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:31,316
Trust me,
career advice from me is...

1091
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:35,946
No. Be afraid.
Be very afraid.

1092
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,159
Are you all right?

1093
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:43,996
lt's my dad.

1094
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:46,415
He used to bring a change
of clothes to our house

1095
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:47,499
when he came to visit.

1096
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:49,001
He always smelled
like patchouli,

1097
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:50,210
and my mom hated it.

1098
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:55,424
So it was my job to wash
and fold his laundry.

1099
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:01,597
Anyway.

1100
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,186
How did they meet?

1101
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:12,858
Backstage at a
King Crimson concert.

1102
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:17,529
My dad was a music
manager. A & R guy.

1103
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:21,199
My mom was this
L.A. scenester.

1104
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:22,409
A groupie, basically.

1105
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:28,957
For a while, he'd come on
Sundays. We'd go to movies,

1106
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,293
have a picnic.

1107
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,504
He just had this light.

1108
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:38,091
And when he would laugh,

1109
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:40,510
it made me feel like
l was really funny.

1110
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:45,349
But then he stopped coming.

1111
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,021
No more light.

1112
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:52,564
Did you ever
see him again?

1113
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:57,027
l tried to see him.
When l was 15.

1114
01:00:57,153 --> 01:01:00,656
l actually bought a dress,
took the bus to his studio.

1115
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:07,412
He kept me an hour
waiting in his office

1116
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:10,082
and then we
finally got in his car...

1117
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:11,583
Which one?
l mean, what kind?

1118
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:15,295
He had a Country Squire.
That's an old station wagon.

1119
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:19,925
And we went to this house
in Los Feliz. Some guitarist.

1120
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:24,304
And l was standing
in the corner,

1121
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:28,100
staring at my shoes
in my discount prom dress.

1122
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:32,479
They were smoking
and drinking and...

1123
01:01:34,982 --> 01:01:37,067
l just kept telling myself,

1124
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,947
"Do not give this man
your tears."

1125
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:47,244
After a while
he drove me home, gave me a $50 bill,

1126
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:52,457
and my last image of my dad

1127
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:59,381
are taillights
while he drove away

1128
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,134
to his other family.

1129
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:07,264
And the crazy thing is,
you don't ask,

1130
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:09,141
"What's wrong with him?"

1131
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:14,396
No. You ask,
"What's wrong with me?"

1132
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:22,696
There's nothing wrong
with you.

1133
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:32,038
Mostly l'm just still pissed
he got me in a dress.

1134
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:38,670
So, the...

1135
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:45,469
The other family,
did he ever talk about them?

1136
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:47,596
l didn't want to know.

1137
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:51,057
l hated them.
They got him.

1138
01:02:56,355 --> 01:02:57,606
What about your mom?

1139
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:00,233
My mom died
a couple years ago.

1140
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:02,778
My sweet mom.

1141
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:06,198
You know, she never said
a bad word about him.

1142
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,578
Can l just say,

1143
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:15,373
your life is ass.

1144
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:19,586
lt's really...

1145
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:21,087
Don't laugh at me.

1146
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:23,298
No, l'm not.
l'm not laughing at you.

1147
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:26,551
l'm just thinking
how strong you are.

1148
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:29,179
-l don't feel strong.
-You're incredibly strong.

1149
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:31,765
So when is your flight?

1150
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:34,810
Uh...

1151
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,646
l got
a text earlier, actually,

1152
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:40,232
and things are shifting
around at work, so...

1153
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:44,319
Looks like l have to stay
in L.A. a little longer.

1154
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:46,530
l know
it's about the nachos.

1155
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:48,406
Nachos, please.

1156
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:52,160
You stuffing your face
like a wildebeest in heat.

1157
01:03:56,415 --> 01:04:00,085
Early one morning the sun was shining
l was laying in bed

1158
01:04:00,127 --> 01:04:04,130
Wondering if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red

1159
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:08,969
Her folks, they said our lives together
Sure was gonna be rough

1160
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:11,930
They never did like
Mama's homemade dress

1161
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:14,224
Papa's bankbook
wasn't big enough

1162
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:17,269
And l was standing
on the side of the road

1163
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:21,565
Heading out
for the East Coast

1164
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:24,359
Lord knows l've paid
some dues getting through

1165
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:27,362
Come on. Let's go.
Hustle, Carol.

1166
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:28,613
Okay.

1167
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:33,410
Hey, man. No.
Off, off, off.

1168
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:36,288
Hey, look. Your backpack
that you left in the backseat?

1169
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:37,372
lt's in the trunk.

1170
01:04:37,498 --> 01:04:38,498
That's where that was?

1171
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:39,708
Also, the ride home
from the record store,

1172
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:40,792
maybe not mention it, okay?

1173
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:42,627
-Why?
-Hey, there.

1174
01:04:44,505 --> 01:04:45,797
Nice car, huh, Josh?

1175
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:49,259
Josh, Sam.

1176
01:04:50,511 --> 01:04:51,511
Howdy.

1177
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:55,640
What's up?

1178
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:59,477
All right, child. Hey, hey!
No, no, no! Oh... Okay...

1179
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:02,272
We drove that car
as far as we could

1180
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:04,566
Abandoned it out west

1181
01:05:06,193 --> 01:05:07,819
A little glamour face.

1182
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:10,655
l can't actually
shoot anything.

1183
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,365
-Are you filming?
-Yeah!

1184
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:16,870
l heard her say
over my shoulder

1185
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:20,165
"We'll meet again someday
on the avenue"

1186
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:21,541
Whoo!

1187
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:24,669
Tangled up in blue

1188
01:05:26,672 --> 01:05:27,672
This is incredible.

1189
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:33,470
My gosh,
look at its little face.

1190
01:05:33,512 --> 01:05:34,596
lt's looking right at me.

1191
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:37,599
Please, sir, spare my life.

1192
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:39,809
l don't deserve
to be eaten, mate.

1193
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:42,646
What? Why is
the crab British?

1194
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:45,607
You gotta
mallet that thing.

1195
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:46,775
Because l'm a hater.

1196
01:05:46,859 --> 01:05:47,943
Let's hear
a little Keith Moon.

1197
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:52,781
Whoo! Drum duet!

1198
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:55,742
Hit it!

1199
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:57,202
Oh!

1200
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:58,411
Let me show you a trick.

1201
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:00,664
Take the crab leg like such.
We go like that.

1202
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:05,627
We take our handy red
crab claw.

1203
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:07,629
There you go, buddy.

1204
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:28,316
-Yeah, l've seen better.
-Oh, yeah.

1205
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:31,236
Yeah, God,
is this the best you got?

1206
01:06:36,867 --> 01:06:37,867
-Ugh!
-Josh!

1207
01:06:38,744 --> 01:06:39,744
But it's real.

1208
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:41,663
Thank you!

1209
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:43,248
And l'm still crying.

1210
01:07:02,476 --> 01:07:03,476
Hello?

1211
01:07:03,602 --> 01:07:05,270
Hey, it's me.

1212
01:07:05,813 --> 01:07:06,980
How are you?

1213
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:09,733
You know. Amazing.

1214
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,943
A woman keeps calling
and leaving messages.

1215
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:13,403
l think she wants
to arrest you.

1216
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:15,321
So, at least
l'm not the only one.

1217
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:17,741
Why did you call?

1218
01:07:19,785 --> 01:07:21,911
Just wanted to hear
that l didn't lose you

1219
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:26,958
to some circus troupe
of lawyers.

1220
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:31,880
l know you do.

1221
01:07:34,967 --> 01:07:37,010
-l should go.
-l met her.

1222
01:07:37,344 --> 01:07:38,803
Her name's Frankie.

1223
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:43,475
She tried so hard
to get his attention.

1224
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:45,810
Get him to notice her.

1225
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,981
lt's almost like we did
grow up in the same house.

1226
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:55,945
Except you ran away from him
and she didn't have a choice.

1227
01:07:56,989 --> 01:07:58,990
You're good at running away,
you know?

1228
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:01,493
Yeah.

1229
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:05,330
l've been practicing
a long time.

1230
01:08:05,372 --> 01:08:06,790
And l know
it's hard on you.

1231
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:12,045
Did you tell her
everything you know?

1232
01:08:16,842 --> 01:08:18,009
l don't know how.

1233
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:19,594
Sam...

1234
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:23,556
You're going
to hurt this woman, you realize that.

1235
01:08:23,682 --> 01:08:25,558
And you got to make it right.

1236
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:28,853
l got to go.

1237
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:49,707
Dude, l could
totally be in a band.

1238
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:52,377
You know what l'd call it?
My Friend's Band.

1239
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:55,046
Like, "You got to see
My Friend's Band."

1240
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:57,841
Or like, "You got to hear
My Friend's Band."

1241
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,884
Oh, my God.
People would be so confused.

1242
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:01,928
-Hey, Josh.
-Hey, Luce.

1243
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,514
That girl is so caliente,

1244
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:06,724
l don't even know
what to do with myself.

1245
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:08,560
Actually, l do know
what to do with myself.

1246
01:09:08,727 --> 01:09:12,021
Oh, God, no.
No, Romeo.

1247
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,859
So, can l just
ask you questions

1248
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:17,068
and you answer me?

1249
01:09:17,194 --> 01:09:19,946
Not as my mentor,
just as some old dude?

1250
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:21,990
Oh, that would be great.

1251
01:09:22,741 --> 01:09:24,159
How do you get
girls to like you?

1252
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:28,079
"How do you get
girls to like you?"

1253
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:31,040
Well, you know,
you just want to be the...

1254
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:33,918
Well, you want to be
the kind of guy that, like...

1255
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:35,962
Uh...

1256
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:37,839
-You know.
-No, l don't know.

1257
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:39,215
And it sounds like
you don't either.

1258
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:41,426
That's true.
Here. Strawberries.

1259
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,845
At least tell me
the six rules.

1260
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:46,264
Nah. You're not ready.
Soon enough.

1261
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:49,058
-Come on. Come on.
-Soon. Soon, l swear.

1262
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:50,435
Don't deny me
like that, man.

1263
01:09:50,477 --> 01:09:51,477
Hey.

1264
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:54,772
Hurricane Carol
finally made landfall today,

1265
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:57,108
pulverizing
Southern California.

1266
01:09:57,902 --> 01:09:58,943
Nice catch.

1267
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:02,113
-What is this?
-That's a salami sampler.

1268
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,781
Because it turns out
there is more than

1269
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:05,200
one type of salami.

1270
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:08,494
Hot salami, sweet salami,
all the kinds of salami.

1271
01:10:08,829 --> 01:10:10,079
-Whoa, whoa. l got it.
-That made my day.

1272
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,207
Josh, can you go
do your homework

1273
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:13,416
or something, please?

1274
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:15,793
Why? You barely
made it through high school.

1275
01:10:15,836 --> 01:10:17,128
Look how well
you turned out.

1276
01:10:17,254 --> 01:10:20,215
Hey, hey. All right.
Thank you. Goodbye.

1277
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:21,466
Go be productive, please.

1278
01:10:21,508 --> 01:10:23,259
Yeah, let me go
invent something.

1279
01:10:25,012 --> 01:10:27,180
Do l look like
l can't provide for my kid? l work.

1280
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:29,390
No. l know.

1281
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:31,935
You got a lot on your plate.
l was just trying to help out.

1282
01:10:35,522 --> 01:10:37,065
What's going on?

1283
01:10:39,944 --> 01:10:41,402
A lawyer called today.

1284
01:10:42,279 --> 01:10:43,321
Mmm-hmm.

1285
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:47,158
My dad left Josh 150 grand.

1286
01:10:48,452 --> 01:10:50,995
Wow. That's...

1287
01:10:51,997 --> 01:10:53,164
-That's great.
-No.

1288
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:56,125
l don't want his
dead bribe money.

1289
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:03,299
You can't turn down
$150,000, Frankie. That's...

1290
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:05,260
Frankie,
you could buy a house

1291
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:06,386
with a yard
for your gardening.

1292
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:07,553
You could
pay off the pool,

1293
01:11:07,846 --> 01:11:09,013
you can go back to school.
Whatever.

1294
01:11:09,139 --> 01:11:10,181
He wanted you to have it.

1295
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:11,391
What, are you
on his side now?

1296
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:13,101
lt's 150 grand!

1297
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:15,478
Okay.

1298
01:11:17,481 --> 01:11:20,233
What is this?
What's going on here?

1299
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:23,027
This...

1300
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:26,197
This is Josh missed the bus
and l picked him up.

1301
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:27,365
He said you guys
needed some groceries,

1302
01:11:27,408 --> 01:11:28,616
-so l decided to help out.
-No. This.

1303
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:31,119
This hanging out with us.

1304
01:11:31,245 --> 01:11:32,537
l like hanging out
with you guys.

1305
01:11:32,871 --> 01:11:35,123
Why don't l know
anything about you? l mean...

1306
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:36,874
What is with
the 20 questions?

1307
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:38,376
Why won't you ever
talk about your recovery?

1308
01:11:38,502 --> 01:11:39,877
Most of us
can't talk about it enough.

1309
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:40,920
l don't know.

1310
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:43,006
Why do you have
these weirdly long pauses

1311
01:11:43,048 --> 01:11:44,090
when l ask a question?

1312
01:11:44,216 --> 01:11:45,383
l bought you groceries!

1313
01:11:45,426 --> 01:11:46,884
l didn't ask you
to do that.

1314
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:48,344
-You're grilling me?
-Just answer my questions.

1315
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:51,097
The world does not need
another AA sob story.

1316
01:11:51,223 --> 01:11:53,016
ls that a good enough
answer for you?

1317
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:55,560
lt's a really shitty
answer, actually.

1318
01:11:55,602 --> 01:11:57,103
Do you hate the idea
of making your life better?

1319
01:11:57,187 --> 01:11:58,354
ls it that bad of an idea?

1320
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,648
Well, you're one to talk,
Mr. Goat Leverager.

1321
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:03,401
l mean, is that you
realizing your potential?

1322
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:05,528
l'm just saying,
you can have a better life. All right?

1323
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:08,239
You can leave the bar
and be appreciated.

1324
01:12:08,365 --> 01:12:10,158
-For what?
-For who you are!

1325
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:12,535
-The same goes for Josh.
-Okay, whoa.

1326
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:14,329
You think maybe you're not
in the best position

1327
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:16,164
to be handing out
parenting advice?

1328
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:18,333
Have you ever even
taken care of a goldfish?

1329
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:21,419
Do you comprehend
what it is to be responsible

1330
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,004
for another human being?

1331
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:27,258
You cart him around.
You... You stock my fridge.

1332
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:29,344
You're atoning for
l don't know what.

1333
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:31,387
'Cause l enjoy hanging out
with him. He's a good kid!

1334
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:33,097
You're gonna go back
to New York.

1335
01:12:34,641 --> 01:12:37,727
And how's my kid
gonna deal with that?

1336
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:43,941
So l'm just asking you,
what do you want here?

1337
01:12:44,568 --> 01:12:45,943
You want me
to tell you to stay?

1338
01:12:45,986 --> 01:12:48,112
No, no.

1339
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:49,697
ls that what
you're looking for?

1340
01:12:50,991 --> 01:12:54,577
l said it. l would like you
guys to be happy. That's it.

1341
01:12:57,414 --> 01:12:58,664
That's all you want?

1342
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,630
l got to go.

1343
01:13:40,749 --> 01:13:42,125
Mom.

1344
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:44,001
-Oh...
-What's wrong?

1345
01:13:44,044 --> 01:13:46,003
Oh, l just...
l stood up too fast.

1346
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:48,506
l just get
a little dizzy sometimes.

1347
01:13:48,632 --> 01:13:50,591
Sometimes? How often?
How long has this been going on for?

1348
01:13:50,717 --> 01:13:52,510
Where have you been, huh?

1349
01:13:52,636 --> 01:13:53,719
Does she have a name?

1350
01:13:54,012 --> 01:13:56,055
l liked Hannah.
She's good for you.

1351
01:13:56,181 --> 01:13:57,765
Let me just help you up.

1352
01:13:59,017 --> 01:14:00,518
l'm fine, l'm fine.

1353
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:02,103
Do you want me
to call a doctor?

1354
01:14:02,187 --> 01:14:03,646
No, please. No violins.

1355
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:05,565
l just need
a little fresh air.

1356
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:24,375
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, l understand.

1357
01:14:25,043 --> 01:14:26,169
Mmm-hmm.

1358
01:14:26,211 --> 01:14:28,045
l appreciate it.
Thank you.

1359
01:14:28,088 --> 01:14:29,255
Okay, l'm here to help.

1360
01:14:29,339 --> 01:14:30,339
Okay, bye.

1361
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:36,387
She said
you have some kind of

1362
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:37,680
plaque buildup
around your heart.

1363
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:39,140
Mmm-hmm.

1364
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:41,476
-Arterio...
-Sclerosis.

1365
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,727
Mmm-hmm.

1366
01:14:42,769 --> 01:14:44,437
You've known about it
for a year.

1367
01:14:44,521 --> 01:14:46,063
Why aren't you treating it?

1368
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:48,566
-l am treating it.
-By not eating Entenmann's?

1369
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:51,277
That happens to be
a real sacrifice.

1370
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:59,452
lt's an outpatient procedure.

1371
01:14:59,536 --> 01:15:01,621
lt will take four hours.
lt's not surgery.

1372
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:04,415
l've had enough doctors
for one lifetime.

1373
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:09,045
That's great, Mom,
suffer in silence.

1374
01:15:09,087 --> 01:15:10,087
That's really smart.

1375
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:11,797
At least l do it
in silence.

1376
01:15:13,133 --> 01:15:14,759
What a wonderful
philosophy, Mom.

1377
01:15:15,093 --> 01:15:18,095
lt really made
for a happy home.

1378
01:15:18,138 --> 01:15:19,472
l mean,
it's a great philosophy.

1379
01:15:19,598 --> 01:15:21,807
You didn't want to talk,
he didn't want to listen.

1380
01:15:22,142 --> 01:15:25,770
No one actually tells anyone
what's really happening.

1381
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:29,398
Okay. Seeing that
your father is too dead to defend himself,

1382
01:15:29,441 --> 01:15:30,441
you got me.

1383
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:32,777
Let's hear all about
how bad you had it.

1384
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:34,612
He was a liar.

1385
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:37,323
-Professionally.
-lt's a lot to live down to.

1386
01:15:37,449 --> 01:15:38,449
And this girl
you're dating,

1387
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:40,451
that's the real reason
you're hanging around here, isn't it?

1388
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:41,536
What is she,
a waitress?

1389
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:44,288
Ah. Kid?

1390
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:45,456
You don't want to
have this conversation, Mom.

1391
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:46,541
How'd you guys meet?

1392
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:47,667
No, no, no, play fair.

1393
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:49,335
You don't want to
have this conversation.

1394
01:15:49,461 --> 01:15:50,795
lt's really not right
that you know all about Jerry

1395
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:52,129
and l'm not allowed
to go after...

1396
01:15:52,256 --> 01:15:53,506
What was her name again?

1397
01:15:54,132 --> 01:15:55,800
You want to hear about her?
l'll tell you all about her.

1398
01:15:55,842 --> 01:15:58,386
Oh, can we rule out
Princess Charlotte of Monaco?

1399
01:15:58,512 --> 01:16:00,137
She has a son,
she's an ex-addict,

1400
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:01,222
and we met at AA.

1401
01:16:01,348 --> 01:16:03,266
Trifecta! AA?

1402
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:05,142
And she's Jerry's daughter.

1403
01:16:15,862 --> 01:16:20,157
You are an only child.
You know that.

1404
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:30,293
Wait a minute. Did you know?
Hey, answer me. Did you know?

1405
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:31,669
l don't know what
you're talking about.

1406
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:33,212
Oh, my God.

1407
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:35,131
Will you please stop lying
and just tell me the truth?

1408
01:16:35,173 --> 01:16:36,173
You know her name.
Say it.

1409
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:37,300
l don't know what
you want me to say.

1410
01:16:37,342 --> 01:16:39,218
Say it.
Say her name. Say it.

1411
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:40,761
l am not going to have
this conversation with you.

1412
01:16:40,887 --> 01:16:42,847
-lt's Frankie!
-Who told you?

1413
01:16:44,349 --> 01:16:49,186
We moved past this
a long time ago. lt's over.

1414
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:52,690
You knew.

1415
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:55,359
His responsibility
was to this family.

1416
01:16:57,487 --> 01:16:59,280
Our family.

1417
01:16:59,406 --> 01:17:02,366
For you, for your sake,
you should be grateful.

1418
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:05,620
She grew up
without a father.

1419
01:17:06,371 --> 01:17:08,289
lt was his choice.

1420
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:12,209
-Was it?
-He made peace with it.

1421
01:17:12,336 --> 01:17:15,379
He hid $150,000
and gave me instructions

1422
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:16,714
to give it to her.

1423
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:19,383
Stop it.

1424
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:22,053
-He wanted us to meet.
-l don't want to hear this.

1425
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:23,554
He has a grandson.

1426
01:17:25,557 --> 01:17:29,518
What did you do?

1427
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:33,397
lt's been lovely
to see you, Sam.

1428
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:37,109
Maybe we'll do it again
in another couple of years.

1429
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:42,406
Mr. Harper, l'm an attorney

1430
01:17:42,449 --> 01:17:43,699
calling on behalf
of James Richards

1431
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:45,117
to let you know
your employment

1432
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:46,243
is hereby terminated.

1433
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:48,579
Under the circumstances,
you'd be well advised

1434
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:50,581
to seek legal counsel
immediately.

1435
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:57,463
All right.
lt's arranged by genre, okay?

1436
01:17:57,589 --> 01:17:59,757
You got old school R&B,
mid-'70s funk shit,

1437
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,384
pretty obscure jazz,

1438
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:03,260
world music,
some West African drumming,

1439
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:05,346
soundtracks to
the French pornos.

1440
01:18:06,723 --> 01:18:08,391
My personal top 40.

1441
01:18:08,433 --> 01:18:10,309
lt's a lot of rare shit.
lt's worth money.

1442
01:18:10,435 --> 01:18:12,228
This is so awesome.

1443
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:13,396
Let's hook up
the record player

1444
01:18:13,438 --> 01:18:16,190
and play shit really loud
until she gets home.

1445
01:18:18,777 --> 01:18:20,277
l can't.

1446
01:18:20,445 --> 01:18:22,613
Wait. Come on.
Grand Theft Auto, pizza...

1447
01:18:22,781 --> 01:18:24,699
Maybe l'll even do
a little homework.

1448
01:18:24,825 --> 01:18:26,450
l can't. l got to go.

1449
01:18:26,576 --> 01:18:28,536
-When can you?
-l don't know.

1450
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:29,620
Let's make a plan.

1451
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:32,623
Enough with it.
Enough! Okay?

1452
01:18:32,749 --> 01:18:34,792
"Let's eat pizza, Sam.
Let's play video games."

1453
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:36,335
l have real shit
to deal with.

1454
01:18:36,461 --> 01:18:37,503
And l can't babysit you

1455
01:18:37,587 --> 01:18:39,505
because you don't have
any real friends.

1456
01:18:40,674 --> 01:18:42,550
Don't look at me like that.

1457
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:43,801
l have to go back
to New York now.

1458
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:45,511
Will you tell, uh...

1459
01:18:45,595 --> 01:18:46,637
Will you tell Frankie that

1460
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:47,722
l'll call her
when l get there?

1461
01:18:47,806 --> 01:18:52,309
You tell her, douche.
l'm not your fucking secretary.

1462
01:18:54,646 --> 01:18:56,605
All right, guys,
we have the helix.

1463
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:57,773
There's two different
parts of it.

1464
01:18:57,816 --> 01:19:00,401
You have the tangent
and the axis.

1465
01:19:00,527 --> 01:19:01,819
Can anyone
tell me the difference

1466
01:19:01,862 --> 01:19:04,488
between the right
and the left-handed helix?

1467
01:19:35,812 --> 01:19:36,896
Yeah.

1468
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:39,356
Yes, it is.

1469
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:45,529
Hi, this is Sam Harper.

1470
01:19:45,572 --> 01:19:46,655
You've been trying
to reach me?

1471
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:48,783
You've been avoiding
us, Mr. Harper.

1472
01:19:48,909 --> 01:19:50,785
You're being charged
with violating Section 5

1473
01:19:50,869 --> 01:19:52,328
of the Federal Trade
Commission Act.

1474
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:54,538
We need a complete accounting
of your records

1475
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,956
or we'll go after you
as an individual.

1476
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:57,541
-Do you understand?
-Can you hold on for a second?

1477
01:19:57,626 --> 01:19:59,251
Look, I don't think
you're taking this seriously enough.

1478
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:00,377
We can hold you in contempt.

1479
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:02,463
l could not be taking this
any more seriously.

1480
01:20:02,547 --> 01:20:03,714
Please, if you could just
give me a second.

1481
01:20:03,882 --> 01:20:05,800
-l need to take this call.
-You have 30 seconds.

1482
01:20:07,511 --> 01:20:09,470
Hi. l was
going to call you.

1483
01:20:09,596 --> 01:20:11,263
Hey. Josh broke
a kid's nose,

1484
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:13,474
and the parents
are going to press charges.

1485
01:20:13,558 --> 01:20:14,558
Oh, Jesus...

1486
01:20:14,601 --> 01:20:15,643
Yeah. l'm headed
to school right now.

1487
01:20:15,727 --> 01:20:16,727
Can you please come?

1488
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:19,688
l'm totally freaking out.
Hello?

1489
01:20:20,398 --> 01:20:21,732
l'm at the airport.

1490
01:20:23,777 --> 01:20:26,570
Right. Yeah, forget it.
Forget it. Fuck.

1491
01:20:29,449 --> 01:20:30,449
Sir?

1492
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:32,618
Picture lD?

1493
01:20:45,465 --> 01:20:46,882
Come on.

1494
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:57,768
l'm here
to pick up my son.

1495
01:20:57,811 --> 01:20:58,936
Josh...

1496
01:21:03,733 --> 01:21:04,733
Hi.

1497
01:21:11,575 --> 01:21:14,076
Hey, monkey.
Are you okay?

1498
01:21:15,787 --> 01:21:16,954
l'm sorry.

1499
01:21:17,831 --> 01:21:19,707
l know. l know you are.

1500
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:23,627
l've convinced
Derek's parents not to press charges.

1501
01:21:23,753 --> 01:21:25,004
Oh, thank God.

1502
01:21:26,089 --> 01:21:27,548
Let's talk in my office.

1503
01:21:36,474 --> 01:21:37,474
Thank you.

1504
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:39,810
Hey, l had money
on the fight.

1505
01:21:43,273 --> 01:21:45,149
So,
maybe l could do like

1506
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:46,984
40 hours of
community service?

1507
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:49,904
And l could go back
to Toluca Park?

1508
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:51,488
No, honey.

1509
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:54,491
Are you sure?

1510
01:21:54,618 --> 01:21:56,535
We got to find you
a new school.

1511
01:21:58,997 --> 01:22:01,290
We can talk about it
tomorrow, okay?

1512
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:04,960
lt's going to be
okay, monkey.

1513
01:22:15,388 --> 01:22:17,890
Can l...
Can l talk to him for a second?

1514
01:22:27,525 --> 01:22:28,567
Six rules.

1515
01:22:29,861 --> 01:22:30,986
And listen up,
because l don't know

1516
01:22:31,237 --> 01:22:34,531
if l'm gonna be able to
tell you this again, okay?

1517
01:22:35,659 --> 01:22:37,368
These are from my father.

1518
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:41,288
Number one.
lf you like something

1519
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:43,624
because you think
other people are gonna like it,

1520
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:45,626
it's a sure bet
no one will.

1521
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:49,588
Number two.
Most doors in the world are closed,

1522
01:22:49,714 --> 01:22:52,466
so if you find one
that you want to get into,

1523
01:22:52,592 --> 01:22:54,718
you damn well better have
an interesting knock.

1524
01:22:54,886 --> 01:22:57,763
And if you knock
like you drum, you'll be fine.

1525
01:22:58,848 --> 01:23:02,559
Number three.
Everything that you think is important

1526
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:06,397
isn't.

1527
01:23:07,023 --> 01:23:10,067
And everything that
you think is unimportant is.

1528
01:23:11,736 --> 01:23:14,405
Number four.
Don't shit where you eat.

1529
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:16,031
l wasn't planning on it.

1530
01:23:16,282 --> 01:23:17,658
He meant that
metaphorically, of course.

1531
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:21,620
Now, bear in mind
my father was not all that successful.

1532
01:23:21,746 --> 01:23:24,498
Number five.
Lean into it.

1533
01:23:24,624 --> 01:23:25,749
What does that mean?

1534
01:23:25,917 --> 01:23:27,376
lt means that the outcome
doesn't matter.

1535
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:29,920
What matters is
that you're there for it.

1536
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:33,382
Whatever "it" is,
good or bad.

1537
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:35,884
Kind of like right now.

1538
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:39,638
And finally, number six,
a personal favorite.

1539
01:23:39,764 --> 01:23:42,099
Never sleep with someone who
has more problems than you.

1540
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:43,350
Hey!

1541
01:23:45,395 --> 01:23:49,481
And my very own.
Always assume your mother's listening.

1542
01:23:49,607 --> 01:23:52,943
That is definitely a rule.

1543
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:55,863
Your mom is
always listening.

1544
01:23:57,699 --> 01:23:59,074
So those are the rules.

1545
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:01,785
Thanks, man.

1546
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:11,754
Good luck, champ.

1547
01:24:17,802 --> 01:24:18,969
Sleep.

1548
01:24:36,529 --> 01:24:37,529
We have to...

1549
01:24:39,949 --> 01:24:41,408
Please don't go.

1550
01:24:42,118 --> 01:24:43,702
l just...

1551
01:24:43,787 --> 01:24:45,662
Oh, God,
l'm a horrible person.

1552
01:24:46,956 --> 01:24:47,998
Hey.

1553
01:24:48,708 --> 01:24:50,709
l want you to stay with us.

1554
01:24:50,835 --> 01:24:52,836
-Please don't.
-lt's okay.

1555
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,172
l've heard everything.

1556
01:24:55,507 --> 01:24:59,676
Come on. Relapses, jail,
l've heard everything.

1557
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:02,012
l'm scared, too.

1558
01:25:03,681 --> 01:25:04,932
We'll figure it out.

1559
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:07,184
You are going
to hate me.

1560
01:25:08,394 --> 01:25:10,521
How do you know
what l'm going to feel, huh?

1561
01:25:11,856 --> 01:25:12,898
Are you me?

1562
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:17,569
Yeah...

1563
01:25:19,197 --> 01:25:20,197
Sort of.

1564
01:25:26,579 --> 01:25:27,704
l'm his son.

1565
01:25:29,541 --> 01:25:31,708
Jerry, he's my father.

1566
01:25:34,504 --> 01:25:36,797
He asked me
to give you the money.

1567
01:25:36,923 --> 01:25:39,550
l wanted to tell you.
l should have told you.

1568
01:25:39,676 --> 01:25:40,717
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

1569
01:25:43,638 --> 01:25:46,473
-Frankie, l am so sorry.
-Get out. Get out.

1570
01:25:46,599 --> 01:25:49,685
Get out. Get out.
Get out. Get out!

1571
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:52,187
Get out of my house!
Get out!

1572
01:25:58,862 --> 01:26:00,487
l'm going. Okay.

1573
01:26:00,613 --> 01:26:01,613
Get out!

1574
01:26:54,751 --> 01:26:56,627
l'm okay.

1575
01:26:56,794 --> 01:26:59,922
l'm sorry, baby.
l'm sorry you had to see that.

1576
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:04,301
Are you okay?

1577
01:27:06,679 --> 01:27:11,516
Yeah, l'm okay.
l'm okay, we're okay, honey. We're okay.

1578
01:27:28,284 --> 01:27:29,284
Thanks.

1579
01:27:36,668 --> 01:27:38,001
Hi, Carol.

1580
01:27:41,673 --> 01:27:43,507
lf this is redemption

1581
01:27:44,842 --> 01:27:47,219
Why do l bother at all?

1582
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:51,556
There's nothing to mention

1583
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:55,018
And nothing has changed

1584
01:27:57,855 --> 01:28:00,691
Still I'd rather be
working for something

1585
01:28:00,733 --> 01:28:03,277
Than praying for the rain

1586
01:28:05,613 --> 01:28:09,825
So I wander on
till someone else is saved

1587
01:28:20,378 --> 01:28:22,045
Me l was holding

1588
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:26,466
All of my secrets
soft and hid

1589
01:28:28,094 --> 01:28:32,723
Pages were folded
then there was nothing at all

1590
01:28:35,226 --> 01:28:37,728
Um, sit wherever you want.

1591
01:28:37,854 --> 01:28:42,607
If in the future
l might need myself a savior

1592
01:28:43,443 --> 01:28:48,238
l'll remember
what was written on that wall

1593
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:56,079
That we don't eat until
your father's at the table

1594
01:28:58,458 --> 01:29:04,212
We don't drink until
the devil's turned to dust

1595
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:12,971
Never once has any man
l've met been able to love

1596
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:19,311
So if l were you
l'd have a little trust

1597
01:29:19,395 --> 01:29:21,563
Hey, it's Hannah. Leave a message.

1598
01:29:22,273 --> 01:29:24,316
Hey, Han, it's me.

1599
01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:31,239
My mom's going
into Cedars tomorrow.

1600
01:29:31,866 --> 01:29:37,120
Cedars is a...
lt's not a forest, it's a hospital.

1601
01:29:38,247 --> 01:29:40,290
lt's just for this,
uh, well...

1602
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:43,293
lt's supposed to be
for this outpatient procedure.

1603
01:29:43,461 --> 01:29:46,254
lt's not an emergency
or anything.

1604
01:29:49,258 --> 01:29:51,885
But l just thought
l'd tell you that.

1605
01:29:55,765 --> 01:29:57,140
l also really wanted
to tell you that l'm...

1606
01:29:58,267 --> 01:29:59,768
lf you're happy with your message,

1607
01:29:59,811 --> 01:30:00,852
press one.

1608
01:30:00,937 --> 01:30:02,854
To delete this message,
press two.

1609
01:30:05,483 --> 01:30:11,363
So if in the future
l might need myself a savior

1610
01:30:12,532 --> 01:30:17,327
l'll remember what
was written on that wall

1611
01:30:18,704 --> 01:30:20,747
You can wait downstairs.
lt shouldn't be too long.

1612
01:30:20,832 --> 01:30:22,082
All right.

1613
01:30:25,002 --> 01:30:26,837
l'll be here
when you get out, okay?

1614
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:28,338
Okay.

1615
01:30:30,174 --> 01:30:32,259
Oh, would you take these?

1616
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:49,443
Finish your sentence.

1617
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:52,279
What's the other reason
you were calling?

1618
01:31:00,955 --> 01:31:02,747
l'm sorry about everything.

1619
01:31:07,962 --> 01:31:09,045
l'm sorry.

1620
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:12,466
l love you.

1621
01:31:18,139 --> 01:31:21,099
Sweetie, you look like
all kinds of shit.

1622
01:31:24,437 --> 01:31:27,814
l told her.
l gave her the money.

1623
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:29,858
l knew you would.

1624
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:34,446
You're not coming
back, are you?

1625
01:31:37,241 --> 01:31:38,909
Well, that may be up to
the fine people

1626
01:31:38,993 --> 01:31:40,577
at the Federal
Trade Commission.

1627
01:31:40,912 --> 01:31:41,995
lt's a good thing
you're going to be a lawyer.

1628
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:43,413
l'm gonna need one.

1629
01:31:46,083 --> 01:31:49,336
l will dig my way out,
one mess at a time.

1630
01:31:51,214 --> 01:31:53,131
But this is where
l'm supposed to be.

1631
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:56,510
l'm not worried
about you anymore.

1632
01:31:58,346 --> 01:32:00,347
Or as worried.

1633
01:32:02,808 --> 01:32:04,809
l was thinking maybe
you could stay.

1634
01:32:07,313 --> 01:32:09,105
l got into NYU.

1635
01:32:12,068 --> 01:32:15,070
Han, that's...
That's great!

1636
01:32:15,196 --> 01:32:17,989
Congratulations.
That's wonderful.

1637
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:23,370
l'm happy for you.

1638
01:32:24,288 --> 01:32:25,539
And UCLA.

1639
01:32:30,127 --> 01:32:33,255
l knew you'd turn out to be
a halfway-decent guy.

1640
01:32:51,440 --> 01:33:13,336
Mom?

1641
01:33:15,256 --> 01:33:16,256
You okay?

1642
01:33:22,888 --> 01:33:24,556
l made him choose.

1643
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,021
And he chose us.

1644
01:33:33,482 --> 01:33:36,526
Marriage, Sam.

1645
01:33:38,112 --> 01:33:40,196
Well, you're going
to find out.

1646
01:33:41,616 --> 01:33:43,700
l didn't think
it would turn out this way.

1647
01:33:45,202 --> 01:33:46,620
l don't know...
lf l hadn't have done it,

1648
01:33:46,704 --> 01:33:48,288
l don't know that
things would have

1649
01:33:49,665 --> 01:33:51,166
turned out any better.

1650
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:55,086
Maybe there'd be
another family. And another.

1651
01:34:01,135 --> 01:34:02,719
Well, he made up his mind.

1652
01:34:05,181 --> 01:34:08,391
l wasn't going to let him ruin the
one thing l had created.

1653
01:34:09,602 --> 01:34:12,062
The only thing
that made sense.

1654
01:34:13,689 --> 01:34:14,939
You.

1655
01:34:18,694 --> 01:34:21,196
But it didn't really
work out that way, did it?

1656
01:34:22,448 --> 01:34:25,241
Every time he looked at me,
he must have seen Frankie.

1657
01:34:27,161 --> 01:34:28,495
He saw what he gave up.

1658
01:34:31,248 --> 01:34:33,249
l would have
avoided me, too.

1659
01:34:34,043 --> 01:34:37,754
l hope you never
have to know what it's like

1660
01:34:38,005 --> 01:34:39,297
to love someone

1661
01:34:41,342 --> 01:34:43,968
and then find out
you're not enough.

1662
01:34:45,638 --> 01:34:48,598
l was trying to protect you
from ever feeling that.

1663
01:34:50,309 --> 01:34:54,062
Don't you think
l believed l was flying to your defense

1664
01:34:55,481 --> 01:34:57,982
with all the courage
in my heart?

1665
01:34:59,318 --> 01:35:02,570
You're my son, Sam.
My son.

1666
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:07,784
lt was the only thing
l could do.

1667
01:35:22,216 --> 01:35:24,426
l'm not sure if we're ever
going to agree on that.

1668
01:35:29,056 --> 01:35:30,306
But l love you.

1669
01:35:41,485 --> 01:35:42,736
l guess

1670
01:35:44,447 --> 01:35:47,615
maybe we could both
start trying to be...

1671
01:35:48,659 --> 01:35:49,659
Be people.

1672
01:35:51,328 --> 01:35:52,579
Be people!

1673
01:35:57,501 --> 01:36:01,087
l told him
it was my fault

1674
01:36:01,213 --> 01:36:05,091
that you were always
so far away, and he said,

1675
01:36:05,217 --> 01:36:09,596
"Just watch.
Sam's going to surprise you."

1676
01:36:31,202 --> 01:36:32,243
Oh.

1677
01:36:43,214 --> 01:36:45,381
l think this is
meant for you.

1678
01:37:29,552 --> 01:37:30,760
Come on, man,
it's her last check.

1679
01:37:30,803 --> 01:37:31,803
She must have left something.

1680
01:37:31,887 --> 01:37:33,638
A forwarding address,
a phone number?

1681
01:37:33,764 --> 01:37:35,890
Look, man. l don't
know what to tell you. She just quit.

1682
01:37:37,643 --> 01:37:40,270
Our course materials
are designed

1683
01:37:40,312 --> 01:37:42,939
with the career-oriented
student in mind.

1684
01:37:43,274 --> 01:37:46,276
Our first semester
covers landscaping

1685
01:37:46,318 --> 01:37:48,194
in the age of technology,

1686
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:52,365
pricing your proposed design,
interior plant-scaping,

1687
01:37:52,491 --> 01:37:56,661
and understanding
what the client wants.

1688
01:37:59,373 --> 01:38:01,457
Josh, your records
are in the living room.

1689
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:02,792
All right.

1690
01:38:03,669 --> 01:38:04,794
Okay.

1691
01:38:05,337 --> 01:38:06,963
-Last one.
-l love it. l'll take it.

1692
01:38:07,298 --> 01:38:08,673
You want some help
getting these in?

1693
01:38:08,757 --> 01:38:10,466
No, you did
enough already.

1694
01:38:10,551 --> 01:38:11,885
-Whatever.
-Thanks so much.

1695
01:38:11,969 --> 01:38:13,803
Okay, so,
dinner Thursday.

1696
01:38:13,846 --> 01:38:15,263
-Yes.
-Okay.

1697
01:38:15,306 --> 01:38:17,181
-Baked ziti.
-Sure. Whatever that is.

1698
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:29,861
This is what I call
a healthy meal.

1699
01:38:29,945 --> 01:38:31,696
Oh!

1700
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:33,781
All right. Let me hear
Keith Moon! Keith Moon!

1701
01:39:59,076 --> 01:40:03,788
Well, that was quite a knock.
ls it Halloween?

1702
01:40:06,125 --> 01:40:07,125
ls Sam home?

1703
01:40:07,251 --> 01:40:11,004
No. He's out.
Who are you?

1704
01:40:11,755 --> 01:40:12,797
l'm Josh.

1705
01:40:26,812 --> 01:40:27,937
Lillian.

1706
01:40:29,648 --> 01:40:30,982
Um...

1707
01:40:31,066 --> 01:40:32,608
Can l leave him a note?

1708
01:40:52,921 --> 01:40:55,548
Josh! Enough chips.
We're having dinner.

1709
01:40:55,632 --> 01:40:59,177
But it's sour cream and onion.
lt's like milk and vegetables.

1710
01:41:00,054 --> 01:41:01,220
Give me one.

1711
01:41:24,244 --> 01:41:25,828
You did this?

1712
01:41:35,756 --> 01:41:37,298
Mom.

1713
01:41:39,843 --> 01:41:41,344
You need to talk to him.

1714
01:42:18,674 --> 01:42:20,049
Just lean into it, man.

1715
01:42:25,722 --> 01:42:26,722
What do you want?

1716
01:42:26,807 --> 01:42:27,890
l came to tell you
how sorry l am.

1717
01:42:28,016 --> 01:42:30,977
The one guy taking
interest in my kid and it had to be you.

1718
01:42:31,103 --> 01:42:33,896
And you lied
about recovering. Who does that?

1719
01:42:33,939 --> 01:42:35,064
-That is sacred!
-l know.

1720
01:42:35,232 --> 01:42:38,359
No, you don't know.
l let you in.

1721
01:42:39,236 --> 01:42:41,404
You humiliated me.

1722
01:42:43,740 --> 01:42:44,782
Please. Just go.

1723
01:42:44,908 --> 01:42:46,284
l'm sorry that l hurt you.

1724
01:42:46,368 --> 01:42:47,910
l never meant
to do that, Frankie.

1725
01:42:47,953 --> 01:42:50,746
Please, let me tell you this.
Let me show you something.

1726
01:42:51,415 --> 01:42:52,748
lf you never want
to see me again,

1727
01:42:52,791 --> 01:42:54,000
l completely understand.

1728
01:42:54,126 --> 01:42:58,337
Just don't turn your back
on me. Just listen. Please.

1729
01:43:01,133 --> 01:43:02,425
Why did you do this to me?

1730
01:43:02,759 --> 01:43:04,886
-l was scared.
-Of what?

1731
01:43:05,012 --> 01:43:07,096
Of you! Of everything!

1732
01:43:07,139 --> 01:43:08,848
Six weeks ago
l had no idea you existed,

1733
01:43:08,932 --> 01:43:10,266
and there you were.

1734
01:43:11,018 --> 01:43:12,727
And l needed the money.
You know?

1735
01:43:12,769 --> 01:43:15,146
l was selfish.
l was a coward.

1736
01:43:15,272 --> 01:43:20,318
l was scared of this.
l don't know how to do this.

1737
01:43:22,237 --> 01:43:23,905
We're the only two people
on this planet

1738
01:43:23,947 --> 01:43:25,948
that know what it was like
to be his kid.

1739
01:43:26,783 --> 01:43:28,117
You and me.
That's it.

1740
01:43:28,202 --> 01:43:30,161
That's like...
lt's, uh...

1741
01:43:30,245 --> 01:43:32,955
lt's a miracle or something.
l mean, it is. lt's a miracle.

1742
01:43:33,457 --> 01:43:36,209
How am l ever supposed
to trust you?

1743
01:43:42,174 --> 01:43:43,466
Because...

1744
01:43:45,969 --> 01:43:47,386
Because we're family.

1745
01:43:49,723 --> 01:43:54,727
And families make mistakes,
and l am the king of mistakes.

1746
01:43:59,107 --> 01:44:00,900
l'm asking you
to forgive me.

1747
01:44:02,319 --> 01:44:04,153
And l know it's a lot.
l just...

1748
01:44:07,991 --> 01:44:09,367
Let me be your brother.

1749
01:44:10,786 --> 01:44:12,036
l am your brother.

1750
01:44:13,956 --> 01:44:15,414
l want you
to be my sister.

1751
01:44:20,003 --> 01:44:21,254
lt's all l want.

1752
01:44:25,008 --> 01:44:27,009
l left the money
on the table, you know.

1753
01:44:28,971 --> 01:44:31,514
l got all the way
to the elevator and l realized

1754
01:44:37,062 --> 01:44:38,521
l couldn't do it to Josh.

1755
01:44:39,898 --> 01:44:41,190
So l took it.

1756
01:44:43,277 --> 01:44:45,403
He deserves more than
what we had.

1757
01:44:50,242 --> 01:44:52,785
l think that l waited
my whole life

1758
01:44:54,037 --> 01:44:56,038
for him to come back to me.

1759
01:45:00,377 --> 01:45:01,877
He sent you.

1760
01:45:10,387 --> 01:45:12,013
He wanted
to come back.

1761
01:45:29,406 --> 01:45:31,574
You said he used to
take you on picnics?

1762
01:45:33,869 --> 01:45:34,910
Yeah.

1763
01:45:36,538 --> 01:45:39,123
Your mom
kept taking you after he left.

1764
01:45:40,917 --> 01:45:41,917
Yeah.

1765
01:45:44,588 --> 01:45:46,589
Can l show you
something, please?

1766
01:49:04,412 --> 01:49:11,001
l'm taking all
my dreams with me

1767
01:49:13,547 --> 01:49:20,469
On a mattress
full of memories

1768
01:49:22,889 --> 01:49:29,770
l'm taking all
my dreams with me

1769
01:49:42,867 --> 01:49:49,456
And if anyone asks you
where l've been

1770
01:49:52,335 --> 01:49:57,339
l've been out having fun
with my friends again

1771
01:49:57,382 --> 01:50:02,261
We're dancing real close
but you can always cut in

1772
01:50:02,345 --> 01:50:06,807
We'll be dancing real close
but you can always cut in

1773
01:50:06,850 --> 01:50:12,896
'Cause l signed
on the dotted line

1774
01:50:16,526 --> 01:50:21,739
And that mess
on your plate is mine

1775
01:50:26,077 --> 01:50:32,708
And l ain't asking you
to trust me

1776
01:50:33,710 --> 01:50:36,045
Anymore

1777
01:50:36,087 --> 01:50:40,424
l'm trusting you

1778
01:50:40,508 --> 01:50:44,970
And l say it enough

1779
01:50:55,565 --> 01:50:59,943
We never had a chance

1780
01:51:00,028 --> 01:51:05,240
To watch out for one another

1781
01:51:05,283 --> 01:51:10,079
We both need that

1782
01:51:10,121 --> 01:51:14,750
It's hard when a friend
turns their back

1783
01:51:14,834 --> 01:51:19,296
But when you turned around

1784
01:51:19,381 --> 01:51:23,676
l knew l'd finally found

1785
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:29,056
Someone whose heart
beats the same

1786
01:51:29,099 --> 01:51:31,558
l don't remember too much

1787
01:51:31,601 --> 01:51:38,440
But l remember the day that
l signed on the dotted line

1788
01:51:43,446 --> 01:51:49,660
And that name
next to yours is mine

1789
01:51:53,331 --> 01:51:59,962
And l ain't asking you
to trust me

1790
01:52:00,797 --> 01:52:03,215
This time

1791
01:52:03,299 --> 01:52:07,511
l'm trusting you

1792
01:52:07,595 --> 01:52:12,516
And l say it enough
