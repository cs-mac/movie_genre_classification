1
00:01:08,927 --> 00:01:10,886
Is it real?

2
00:01:10,887 --> 00:01:12,366
Yes.

3
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:15,367
It's said to be from Dad to Mum.

4
00:01:15,767 --> 00:01:18,767
Why have you got it?

5
00:01:19,167 --> 00:01:22,167
Your grandfather gave it to your grandmother
before he left Spain.

6
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:27,367
She was pregnant with me-

7
00:01:27,727 --> 00:01:30,046
-and never saw him again.

8
00:01:30,047 --> 00:01:32,126
It's lovely.

9
00:01:32,127 --> 00:01:35,127
I never thought I'd touch  a real diamond.

10
00:01:36,647 --> 00:01:39,647
-Can I try it on?
-Yes.

11
00:01:46,967 --> 00:01:49,967
-It's yours now, darling.
-Really?

12
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:54,327
I don't know. Mama always
wore it on this finger.

13
00:01:56,727 --> 00:01:59,727
She said it wasn't real.

14
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:05,646
Your mama never heard that sound.

15
00:02:05,647 --> 00:02:07,846
What sound?

16
00:03:08,527 --> 00:03:11,527
That scares the owls away.

17
00:03:11,607 --> 00:03:13,726
I saw that movie too.

18
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:16,727
Don't you believe me?

19
00:03:16,807 --> 00:03:19,366
Before, there was nothing here.

20
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:22,286
Just water. Salt water.

21
00:03:22,287 --> 00:03:25,287
Do you know what that sounded  like?

22
00:03:31,327 --> 00:03:34,327
And the wind.

23
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,887
And both together?

24
00:04:31,287 --> 00:04:34,287
What's that over there?

25
00:05:03,327 --> 00:05:05,846
When did the symptoms start?

26
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,847
I don't know...months ago.

27
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:16,167
You can get dressed.

28
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:24,087
Couldn't you have come sooner?

29
00:05:24,207 --> 00:05:27,207
It didn't hurt like this before.

30
00:05:31,527 --> 00:05:34,527
A nurse is coming to take a blood sample.

31
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:02,927
Why don't you get started?

32
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,807
What's keeping you here?

33
00:11:23,407 --> 00:11:26,407
-Did they tell you about the accident?
-Did you hear something?

34
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:30,486
I only heard Luis.

35
00:11:30,487 --> 00:11:33,487
-The boy farthest away...
-Luis.

36
00:11:33,847 --> 00:11:36,847
Luis is OK.
I helped him further.

37
00:11:38,687 --> 00:11:41,687
He told me he was sorry
and asked to be forgiven...

38
00:11:43,447 --> 00:11:45,526
...for stealing a watch.

39
00:11:45,527 --> 00:11:47,486
Who do you think you are?

40
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:50,487
You're a disgrace. You know nothing.
You come here and just lie to us.

41
00:11:53,967 --> 00:11:56,326
-My son was no thief.
-Let me explain...

42
00:11:56,327 --> 00:11:59,327
Go! - Luis, tell him to go.
Show a bit of respect for our son.

43
00:12:31,487 --> 00:12:33,766
He asked after you.

44
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:36,767
Tell him I'll look in in the morning.

45
00:13:01,207 --> 00:13:03,166
Hi.

46
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:06,167
-Dad, I tried to ring you.
-I'm a bit late, sorry.

47
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,967
Get your bag. Are you right?

48
00:13:15,407 --> 00:13:18,407
Thanks for the help, Lili.
Five o'clock tomorrow, OK?

49
00:13:19,847 --> 00:13:22,766
Say 'bye to Lili.

50
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:25,767
-And Li.
-'Bye!

51
00:13:27,247 --> 00:13:30,247
Fish is yucky.
We all eat the same.

52
00:13:32,207 --> 00:13:35,207
What do you want then?

53
00:13:36,287 --> 00:13:39,287
A hamburger and chips...

54
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:43,926
...and a chocolate milkshake.

55
00:13:43,927 --> 00:13:46,886
Perfect.

56
00:13:46,887 --> 00:13:49,206
And the lady?

57
00:13:49,207 --> 00:13:51,326
Fried egg with sausage-

58
00:13:51,327 --> 00:13:54,327
-and a potato omelette
with cream and cinnamon.

59
00:14:05,007 --> 00:14:08,007
A hamburger.

60
00:14:09,327 --> 00:14:12,286
And look at all the chips.

61
00:14:12,287 --> 00:14:15,287
Chips here and chips there.

62
00:14:18,207 --> 00:14:21,207
And a big chocolate milkshake.

63
00:14:22,367 --> 00:14:24,646
What will the young lady have?

64
00:14:24,647 --> 00:14:27,647
-Fried eggs.
-Fried eggs...

65
00:14:27,807 --> 00:14:30,807
-With sausage.
-Sausage...

66
00:14:31,327 --> 00:14:34,327
And a potato omelette.

67
00:14:34,527 --> 00:14:37,527
-Potato omelette...
-with cream and cinnamon.

68
00:14:43,647 --> 00:14:46,647
Everything as requested.

69
00:14:49,407 --> 00:14:52,407
-What did you get for lunch?
-Rice with chicken.

70
00:14:52,487 --> 00:14:54,286
Daddy, did you know-

71
00:14:54,287 --> 00:14:57,287
-that if a spacesuit got a hole in it, it'd explode?

72
00:14:57,847 --> 00:15:00,847
Tomorow I'll ask Lili to give you something else.

73
00:15:01,687 --> 00:15:04,687
-It isn't Lili who does the food.
-So I'll tell Jung.

74
00:15:05,047 --> 00:15:08,047
It's because of the gravity.

75
00:15:10,807 --> 00:15:13,807
Stop kicking the table, Mateo.

76
00:15:20,367 --> 00:15:23,367
Don't shove so much food into your mouth.

77
00:15:23,727 --> 00:15:26,727
I've told you a thousand times.
A thousand times.

78
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:33,567
Don't be disgusting.
Put it back in your mouth.

79
00:15:36,247 --> 00:15:39,247
Food in your mouth, Mateo.
Once more!

80
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:43,567
Now!

81
00:15:53,407 --> 00:15:56,407
-Do you want any more milk?
-No.

82
00:16:00,047 --> 00:16:02,686
Stop.

83
00:16:02,687 --> 00:16:05,687
Leave the table
and go to your room.

84
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:23,167
Your supposed to go to your room,
not wash your plate.

85
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:08,046
What is it?

86
00:17:08,047 --> 00:17:11,047
I've peed in my pants.

87
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:14,167
I'll wash them in the morning, Daddy.

88
00:18:29,927 --> 00:18:32,927
Yes?

89
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:36,726
Wait a sec.

90
00:18:36,727 --> 00:18:39,086
Can you turn that down?

91
00:18:39,087 --> 00:18:42,087
Turn down the music and stop singing.

92
00:18:47,087 --> 00:18:50,087
Yes, I'm here.
Sorry about that.

93
00:18:50,727 --> 00:18:53,727
Yes, the cemetery rang again.

94
00:18:55,047 --> 00:18:58,047
No, they're building a gallery.

95
00:18:58,607 --> 00:19:01,607
Right over Dad.

96
00:19:01,647 --> 00:19:04,526
They've offered good money.

97
00:19:04,527 --> 00:19:07,527
They're offering good money.

98
00:19:07,727 --> 00:19:10,727
They fix up about the coffin and so forth.

99
00:19:14,607 --> 00:19:17,166
It's a good offer.

100
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:20,167
There's nothing you can do
to stop it.

101
00:19:22,807 --> 00:19:25,807
We should have him cremated.

102
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,606
OK, we'll do it then.

103
00:19:30,607 --> 00:19:33,607
Yes, OK, I'll call you.

104
00:19:34,127 --> 00:19:35,926
OK, next week.

105
00:19:35,927 --> 00:19:37,646
Look after yourself.

106
00:19:37,647 --> 00:19:40,647
Talk to you later.

107
00:19:42,527 --> 00:19:44,926
-Who's being cremated?
-Nobody.

108
00:19:44,927 --> 00:19:47,927
Don't lie.

109
00:19:52,127 --> 00:19:55,127
I'll give you a Thai massage.

110
00:19:55,807 --> 00:19:58,807
Who?

111
00:20:01,327 --> 00:20:04,327
-If you don't tell me...
-It's my dad!

112
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:08,247
We're cremating him.

113
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:13,167
-Which of you is most like your dad?
-I don't know.

114
00:20:13,527 --> 00:20:16,527
I don't remember how he looked.

115
00:20:23,327 --> 00:20:25,966
Give me a kiss.

116
00:20:25,967 --> 00:20:28,967
I'm going.

117
00:20:29,007 --> 00:20:32,007
I gotta go.

118
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:35,807
Stop it.
What the fuck are you doing?

119
00:20:52,407 --> 00:20:55,407
Fucking pig!

120
00:20:57,847 --> 00:21:00,847
She's sick in the head.

121
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:37,367
Where are the others?
I met Cchinaza on the way here.

122
00:21:38,687 --> 00:21:41,446
-Where?
-In El Fondo.

123
00:21:41,447 --> 00:21:44,326
I sent that bugger back.

124
00:21:44,327 --> 00:21:47,327
Where Ccheikh and Mamadou?

125
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:49,966
You gotta keep a check on them,
otherwise we're stuffed.

126
00:21:49,967 --> 00:21:52,967
I've said before.. they can't sell here.
It's off limits.

127
00:21:54,967 --> 00:21:57,967
Understand?
Do you understand what I'm saying?

128
00:21:58,287 --> 00:22:01,286
No one buys bugger all down there.

129
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:04,287
I also heard you've started dealing.

130
00:22:10,527 --> 00:22:13,526
Boys, pack up, they're coming.

131
00:22:13,527 --> 00:22:16,527
Mind the cops.
It's time to blow.

132
00:22:18,367 --> 00:22:21,367
I got something to show you.
Home at my place.

133
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:24,407
Your place? Heavens...

134
00:22:33,367 --> 00:22:35,326
It's stuck.

135
00:22:35,327 --> 00:22:38,327
Can't open it.

136
00:22:40,007 --> 00:22:41,726
Thanks, lge.

137
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:44,727
No sense in dropping the price
if nobody wants them.

138
00:22:46,007 --> 00:22:48,806
Are they all the same?

139
00:22:48,807 --> 00:22:51,807
Most of them.

140
00:22:52,447 --> 00:22:55,447
This month's been a disaster.
You gotta talk to the Chinese.

141
00:22:56,847 --> 00:22:59,847
Maybe I can get some umbrellas.

142
00:23:00,807 --> 00:23:03,807
Fuck that.
There's fuck-all rain around here.

143
00:23:03,927 --> 00:23:06,927
Yeah, you're right there.

144
00:23:09,927 --> 00:23:12,927
-Can you get the kid to sleep?
-You'd think there was no one here.

145
00:23:13,447 --> 00:23:16,447
A bit of quiet.
I've got guests.

146
00:23:19,527 --> 00:23:22,527
Who's done this?
Is it you?

147
00:23:23,647 --> 00:23:26,647
Who did this shit? Is this your handbag?

148
00:23:37,607 --> 00:23:40,607
We're getting nowhere with pirate stuff for cash.
It's now or never.

149
00:23:42,407 --> 00:23:45,407
20 building workers
at 1300 euro each...

150
00:23:46,407 --> 00:23:49,006
That's a lot of money.

151
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:52,007
-I gotta think about that.
-We're stuffed with all your ideas.

152
00:23:52,727 --> 00:23:54,686
We're losing the contract with Mendoza.

153
00:23:54,687 --> 00:23:57,687
The workers then?
Will they go on making this shit?

154
00:23:58,767 --> 00:24:01,767
I don't know what you're talking about
but we gotta do something, and quickly.

155
00:24:03,727 --> 00:24:06,727
I don't think I'll go on selling shit.

156
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:11,647
-The idiot must be good at something.
-The idiot's done a lot more.

157
00:24:23,967 --> 00:24:26,967
That's for your friend in the police.

158
00:24:28,327 --> 00:24:30,606
Did you talk to Mendoza?

159
00:24:30,607 --> 00:24:33,607
yes. My brother has a contact
in a building site in Badalona.

160
00:24:34,207 --> 00:24:37,207
They need a lot of workers right now.
How much money in it?

161
00:24:40,207 --> 00:24:43,207
How much?

162
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:46,567
That's nothing to laugh about, Hai.
How much is it?

163
00:24:48,327 --> 00:24:51,327
What's up with you?
It's sensitive and I have family.

164
00:24:52,527 --> 00:24:54,886
We aren't home in China.

165
00:26:05,127 --> 00:26:08,127
Otherwise you better fucking-well learn African.

166
00:26:09,447 --> 00:26:12,447
You better talk to your people too
and get them to calm down.

167
00:26:15,927 --> 00:26:18,927
That's what I pay you for.

168
00:26:20,647 --> 00:26:23,647
Listen, Uxbal.
We've known each other quite a while now.

169
00:26:24,847 --> 00:26:27,847
But next time you stuff up, you're finished.

170
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:31,487
Got it?

171
00:26:31,567 --> 00:26:34,567
Understood?

172
00:26:36,607 --> 00:26:39,607
OK, let them know.

173
00:26:44,287 --> 00:26:47,287
For October and November.

174
00:26:47,567 --> 00:26:50,567
Next time they pay late, I put them inside.

175
00:26:51,327 --> 00:26:54,327
Got it?
Or shall I translate?

176
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:53,967
-Daddy's home.
-Mummy picked us up barefoot.

177
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,766
I took my shoes off, too.

178
00:27:56,767 --> 00:27:59,486
-Well?
-Well what?

179
00:27:59,487 --> 00:28:02,487
-Why weren't you home?
-I can't be two places at once.

180
00:28:03,087 --> 00:28:06,087
Mummy's making spaghetti.

181
00:28:06,207 --> 00:28:08,886
Turn off the TV.

182
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:11,646
Sit down and eat.

183
00:28:11,647 --> 00:28:14,647
Why is the shower on?

184
00:28:17,327 --> 00:28:20,327
You don't have one ironed shirt.
Good way to iron, eh?

185
00:28:38,527 --> 00:28:40,046
Come and eat.

186
00:28:40,047 --> 00:28:42,086
Lili rang, she was upset.

187
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:45,046
We agreed you should tell me
if you fetched the children.

188
00:28:45,047 --> 00:28:48,047
Sorry... a customer cancelled.

189
00:28:48,207 --> 00:28:51,207
So call me on my mobile.

190
00:28:58,567 --> 00:29:01,566
Will you have some omelette?
It's with apple slices.

191
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:04,567
Just like the potato one,
but softer and sweet.

192
00:29:07,007 --> 00:29:10,007
-Aren't you eating?
-No, I'm not hungry.

193
00:29:11,847 --> 00:29:14,847
Miguel's daughter said they were out in the car yesterday-

194
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:18,006
-when a motorbike overtook them going like a goddamned maniac.

195
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:20,766
So Miguel yelled out:
"Hope you die!"

196
00:29:20,767 --> 00:29:23,446
Five minutes later they saw
the motorbike lying on the road-

197
00:29:23,447 --> 00:29:26,447
-and the rider was a pulp
in a pool of blood.

198
00:29:26,567 --> 00:29:29,567
Miguel was so shocked
that he drove to the hospital.

199
00:29:30,047 --> 00:29:33,047
I don't understand why.
If someone did that to me...

200
00:29:33,527 --> 00:29:36,527
Quiet. Marambra, that's enough.

201
00:29:38,647 --> 00:29:41,647
If you could stop talking,
maybe you'd get hungry.

202
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:45,446
Do me a favour...put that cigarette out.

203
00:29:45,447 --> 00:29:48,447
And take your foot off the table when we're eating.

204
00:29:53,967 --> 00:29:56,967
Do you want to stay and watch a movie after, Mummy?

205
00:30:02,607 --> 00:30:05,607
It's late, sweetie.

206
00:30:06,767 --> 00:30:09,767
If I can't talk, how do I get you
not to include them at funerals?

207
00:30:11,487 --> 00:30:14,126
That's why Mateo's still wetting his bed.

208
00:30:14,127 --> 00:30:15,526
I haven't had them for ages.

209
00:30:15,527 --> 00:30:18,527
That's not what they say.
Just because you have custody...

210
00:30:18,767 --> 00:30:21,767
Do you come to hit your kids or question them?

211
00:30:25,727 --> 00:30:28,727
Mamma, the spaghetti tastes nothing.

212
00:30:30,887 --> 00:30:33,887
-You've still nearly eaten it all up.
-Off you go.

213
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:37,967
Go on.
Let's at least eat in peace.

214
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:43,047
Best I leave.

215
00:30:43,887 --> 00:30:46,887
See you darling.

216
00:30:47,927 --> 00:30:50,927
Enjoy yourself sweetie.

217
00:31:25,207 --> 00:31:28,207
Marambra...

218
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:32,806
Sorry. You did good.

219
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,526
Did good?
Yeah.

220
00:31:34,527 --> 00:31:37,527
Fuck what you think of me.
I'm not a dog.

221
00:31:37,767 --> 00:31:40,767
You've turned the kids against me
No, Marambra, you did that yourself.

222
00:31:42,127 --> 00:31:45,086
It's like it pisses you off to see me happy.

223
00:31:45,087 --> 00:31:48,087
Only with you is it hard to be myself
and feel good..

224
00:31:48,127 --> 00:31:51,127
Do you remember where you lived
last time you felt good?

225
00:31:51,967 --> 00:31:54,967
Do you want me to remind you?

226
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:58,447
You don't need to remind me.

227
00:32:00,407 --> 00:32:03,407
Why are you laughing?

228
00:32:06,887 --> 00:32:09,887
I laugh at anything.
And I like to see people smile.

229
00:32:11,287 --> 00:32:14,287
I'm happy if I'm happy and
down if I'm down.

230
00:32:19,287 --> 00:32:22,287
I just wanted......

231
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:26,166
I love you.

232
00:32:26,167 --> 00:32:29,167
I said I loved you.

233
00:32:37,887 --> 00:32:40,887
Yes, me too.

234
00:33:05,607 --> 00:33:08,607
You wouldn't have some money on you?

235
00:33:20,527 --> 00:33:23,206
Haven't you got any more?
No.

236
00:33:23,207 --> 00:33:26,207
Now that you're selling the grave.
Who told you that?

237
00:33:32,807 --> 00:33:35,807
Tito.
When did you talk to him?

238
00:33:37,087 --> 00:33:40,087
Please don't start. I gave him a
massage. He had a backache.

239
00:33:48,207 --> 00:33:51,207
It's not a grave, it's a niche.

240
00:34:21,447 --> 00:34:23,246
But...

241
00:34:23,247 --> 00:34:26,247
No one told me I was obliged to fast.

242
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:31,086
And...

243
00:34:31,087 --> 00:34:33,486
...it might be a technical error.

244
00:34:33,487 --> 00:34:36,487
No, I'll complain.
Fasting is just a formality.

245
00:34:39,287 --> 00:34:42,287
How's it coming along?
Excuse me?

246
00:34:43,127 --> 00:34:45,526
How...

247
00:34:45,527 --> 00:34:48,366
I've gotta know what happened.

248
00:34:48,367 --> 00:34:51,367
It depends on how your body reacts to chemotherapy.

249
00:34:51,607 --> 00:34:54,607
In your case it's gone a long time-

250
00:34:54,767 --> 00:34:57,767
and it has metatasted from the prostate
to the skeleton and liver.

251
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:03,006
Which means...

252
00:35:03,007 --> 00:35:06,007
But how long?
Roughly how long?

253
00:35:11,327 --> 00:35:14,327
With medical treatment
you can keep your lifestyle-

254
00:35:15,047 --> 00:35:18,047
-for a couple of months.

255
00:35:21,727 --> 00:35:24,727
Months?

256
00:36:22,207 --> 00:36:25,207
Daddy, I've learnt to do a trick.

257
00:36:25,647 --> 00:36:28,326
Think of a country that starts with D.

258
00:36:28,327 --> 00:36:30,526
Daddy, look at me.

259
00:36:30,527 --> 00:36:32,486
Ready?
Yes.

260
00:36:32,487 --> 00:36:35,487
Then think of an animal that starts with L.

261
00:36:36,007 --> 00:36:39,007
Hippopotamus doesn't start with L.

262
00:36:39,487 --> 00:36:41,806
Are you ready?
Yep.

263
00:36:41,807 --> 00:36:44,807
You thought of
leeches in Denmark.

264
00:36:49,047 --> 00:36:52,047
How did you know that?

265
00:36:52,407 --> 00:36:55,406
Daddy, how do you spell ""beautiful""?

266
00:36:55,407 --> 00:36:58,407
-Like it sounds.
-With an i?

267
00:37:00,207 --> 00:37:03,207
Biutiful.

268
00:40:34,367 --> 00:40:37,367
No, that's OK, don't be scared.

269
00:40:37,447 --> 00:40:40,447
Just fetch the kids and take them home.

270
00:40:42,527 --> 00:40:45,046
I don't know.

271
00:40:45,047 --> 00:40:48,047
Til i get out.
In a couple of days, probably.

272
00:41:06,847 --> 00:41:09,847
It's getting tough.

273
00:41:11,727 --> 00:41:14,727
We close down the handbags
and copy movies.

274
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:19,607
You were right.

275
00:41:20,447 --> 00:41:22,926
The building side is lucrative.

276
00:41:22,927 --> 00:41:25,927
The building workers can keep going at Mendoza's.

277
00:41:26,687 --> 00:41:29,687
Pay the ones we agreed on.

278
00:41:32,127 --> 00:41:35,127
You won't regret it
We're helping them.

279
00:41:36,687 --> 00:41:39,687
And it's safer for us.
There's a lot of money to be made.

280
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:45,127
Uxbal asked me for money
for the stoves in the warehouse.

281
00:41:46,647 --> 00:41:49,647
I don't want anyone to freeze in the cellar.

282
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:53,207
OK, I'll see what I can do.
Where are you going?

283
00:41:54,407 --> 00:41:57,407
I've got to go home.

284
00:42:23,487 --> 00:42:26,487
Are you going to fight about a nigger?

285
00:42:30,647 --> 00:42:33,647
How much was the bail?

286
00:42:33,847 --> 00:42:36,847
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

287
00:42:36,967 --> 00:42:39,967
Forget it.
I'll take it from the money they give us for Dad's niche.

288
00:42:43,367 --> 00:42:45,686
Has it been fixed up?

289
00:42:45,687 --> 00:42:48,687
We just gotta fill in some forms from the cemetery
and we get the money.

290
00:42:50,247 --> 00:42:53,247
But first we gotta cremate him.
After that we can do what we want.

291
00:42:53,767 --> 00:42:56,726
We can bury him with Mum's ashes and save money.

292
00:42:56,727 --> 00:42:59,727
Look at these things.

293
00:43:00,487 --> 00:43:03,487
Careful, they're Dad's papers.

294
00:43:07,127 --> 00:43:10,127
How's it going with the Chinese on the building site?

295
00:43:12,207 --> 00:43:15,207
Mendoza is totally crapped off.

296
00:43:15,487 --> 00:43:17,766
Most of them know nothing about building.

297
00:43:17,767 --> 00:43:20,767
None of them speak Spanish
and they all look the same.

298
00:43:22,847 --> 00:43:25,166
Have you told Marambra
about the cemetery?

299
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:27,406
No.

300
00:43:27,407 --> 00:43:30,126
Hmm...

301
00:43:30,127 --> 00:43:33,127
She rang me a while ago.
She rang me looking for you, or something.

302
00:43:34,967 --> 00:43:37,967
But I didn't say anything to her.
I haven't seen her for ages.

303
00:44:19,967 --> 00:44:22,967
Uxbal?

304
00:44:26,487 --> 00:44:29,487
Take this.

305
00:44:29,527 --> 00:44:32,527
That's not necessary.
I gotta know what my son said.

306
00:44:33,527 --> 00:44:36,527
The day before the accident we had a row.

307
00:44:39,727 --> 00:44:42,727
That was the last I...

308
00:44:43,407 --> 00:44:46,407
Your son went off peacefully.
He was scared, so I helped him.

309
00:44:48,887 --> 00:44:51,887
He talked about your watch
and where he'd hidden it.

310
00:44:53,447 --> 00:44:54,886
Where?

311
00:44:54,887 --> 00:44:57,887
Behind a leg of his bed.

312
00:45:00,327 --> 00:45:03,327
Yes.

313
00:45:09,607 --> 00:45:12,607
I'm very sorry. Really.

314
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:39,767
Who is it?
It's me.

315
00:45:44,447 --> 00:45:47,286
I expected you tomorrow
I was in the area and...

316
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:49,406
Come in.

317
00:45:49,407 --> 00:45:52,407
Thanks for the help with the kids
I was thinking I could take them now...

318
00:45:52,847 --> 00:45:55,166
Quiet.

319
00:45:55,167 --> 00:45:58,167
The kids are asleep.
What did you tell them?

320
00:45:58,687 --> 00:46:01,687
That you were at your brother's.
Something about your work..

321
00:46:07,487 --> 00:46:10,487
I'll pick them up in the morning
before they go to school, OK?

322
00:46:12,207 --> 00:46:14,246
You're welcome to stay.

323
00:46:14,247 --> 00:46:16,966
I can put on coffee or tea.

324
00:46:16,967 --> 00:46:19,566
There's wine, too.

325
00:46:19,567 --> 00:46:22,567
Don't look at me like that.
I haven't started drinking.

326
00:46:25,167 --> 00:46:28,167
I opened it for a friend.
Remember my friend Laura?

327
00:47:37,167 --> 00:47:39,446
Cheers.

328
00:47:39,447 --> 00:47:42,447
Tack.

329
00:47:47,327 --> 00:47:50,327
Did they hurt you?
No, I'm OK.

330
00:47:53,647 --> 00:47:56,647
Ana told me about something she dreamt.

331
00:47:57,287 --> 00:48:00,287
You had come home to the flat
and the bedroom was full of sand.

332
00:48:10,807 --> 00:48:13,807
I asked her where Mateo was.

333
00:48:15,927 --> 00:48:18,927
She said she didn't know.

334
00:48:19,087 --> 00:48:22,087
But she believed he was buried under the sand.

335
00:48:23,087 --> 00:48:26,087
Why are you going?

336
00:48:26,127 --> 00:48:29,127
Stay.

337
00:48:37,487 --> 00:48:40,487
I think you'll see me differently.

338
00:48:41,607 --> 00:48:44,607
I don't think it's a good idea.

339
00:48:44,847 --> 00:48:47,847
We both know what will happen.
There's room for everyone here.

340
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:50,046
From the kitchen you get a glimpse of the sea.

341
00:48:50,047 --> 00:48:53,047
We can have breakfast together like we used to.

342
00:48:53,927 --> 00:48:56,286
I can make toast for you...

343
00:48:56,287 --> 00:48:59,287
-Be quiet a moment.
-The children need me.

344
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:03,927
The can't wake up to a new father every weekend.

345
00:49:04,087 --> 00:49:06,166
You always come out with that crap.

346
00:49:06,167 --> 00:49:09,167
It's not just about the kids.
I need you.

347
00:49:09,487 --> 00:49:12,487
I haven't had a relapse in five months.

348
00:49:12,927 --> 00:49:15,927
Give me a chance, darling.

349
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:19,646
You've said that a hundred times.

350
00:49:19,647 --> 00:49:22,647
I haven't had a turn for ages.
It's different now, I promise.

351
00:49:24,007 --> 00:49:25,766
Are you taking those tablets?

352
00:49:25,767 --> 00:49:28,726
You got me to stop taking them
so I could breastfeed Mateo.

353
00:49:28,727 --> 00:49:31,606
You're obsessed with those damned pills.

354
00:49:31,607 --> 00:49:34,326
The doctor said you had to...

355
00:49:34,327 --> 00:49:37,327
The doctor says anything to get rid of me.

356
00:49:38,127 --> 00:49:41,127
None of that shit is going to cure my depression.

357
00:49:44,127 --> 00:49:47,127
I'm trying with a lightbox now.
With a what?

358
00:49:47,367 --> 00:49:50,367
A lightbox. It's terrific.

359
00:49:50,927 --> 00:49:53,927
And much cheaper than medicine.
Can I show you?

360
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:13,407
You see?

361
00:50:14,807 --> 00:50:17,286
It really is terrific.

362
00:50:17,287 --> 00:50:20,287
I started a couple of months ago.

363
00:50:21,887 --> 00:50:24,887
I feel better than ever.
But not like before.

364
00:50:25,767 --> 00:50:28,767
It's different now.
I feel normal.

365
00:50:29,207 --> 00:50:32,207
Like everyone else.

366
00:51:19,607 --> 00:51:22,607
No, stop it Marambra.

367
00:51:26,247 --> 00:51:28,606
No, cut it out...

368
00:51:28,607 --> 00:51:31,607
Stop.

369
00:51:36,207 --> 00:51:39,086
It's OK.

370
00:51:39,087 --> 00:51:42,087
You're really tired.

371
00:51:42,167 --> 00:51:45,167
-Besides, I'm getting old.
-No...no...what are you talking about?

372
00:51:48,167 --> 00:51:51,167
That's me.
At the police station...

373
00:51:53,127 --> 00:51:56,127
...couldn't I stop thinking...

374
00:51:57,007 --> 00:52:00,007
...about coming back to
you and the kids again.

375
00:52:05,647 --> 00:52:08,647
The kids and I need...

376
00:52:13,407 --> 00:52:16,407
Do you remember the time we fucked
in the little cloakroom?

377
00:52:18,887 --> 00:52:21,887
I'd just come to Barcelona
and you greeted me at the drycleaners

378
00:52:22,767 --> 00:52:25,767
You took me in the cloakroom.

379
00:52:26,487 --> 00:52:29,487
The owner caught us...

380
00:53:15,927 --> 00:53:18,927
Up you get!

381
00:53:20,087 --> 00:53:23,087
It's six-thirty.
There's bread and tea out there.

382
00:53:24,887 --> 00:53:27,887
Get moving!

383
00:54:00,087 --> 00:54:02,726
I'm always getting into all kinds of crap.

384
00:54:02,727 --> 00:54:05,727
There are four underage minors.
I don't pay in advance.

385
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:09,327
If we get inspected, where will I hide
so many damned Chinese?

386
00:54:09,487 --> 00:54:11,006
It's our only condition, Mendoza.

387
00:54:11,007 --> 00:54:14,007
I don't pay a cent til I know I've got something

388
00:54:14,927 --> 00:54:17,726
That's how we always do it.
Right, Uxbal?

389
00:54:17,727 --> 00:54:18,766
A week on trial.

390
00:54:18,767 --> 00:54:21,686
Half of them are sick and frozen.

391
00:54:21,687 --> 00:54:24,526
They've never even seen a drill.

392
00:54:24,527 --> 00:54:27,527
It doesn't help cut costs.

393
00:54:27,807 --> 00:54:30,286
The costs?

394
00:54:30,287 --> 00:54:33,287
OK.

395
00:54:33,807 --> 00:54:36,807
Then you can go and hire
unionised construction workers.

396
00:54:38,367 --> 00:54:41,367
When you've worked it out, ring me.

397
00:54:52,127 --> 00:54:55,127
-When do you need the money?
-A week from today.

398
00:54:56,687 --> 00:54:59,687
Stop looking like a scared Chinaman..
I'll pay for next week.

399
00:55:00,447 --> 00:55:03,206
But then I'll have the papers latest on Friday.

400
00:55:03,207 --> 00:55:05,166
Ok, OK.

401
00:56:37,567 --> 00:56:40,567
On Anas birthday...
could the four of us go to the country?

402
00:56:41,127 --> 00:56:43,926
Only at the weekend.

403
00:56:43,927 --> 00:56:46,486
-Sure. Where to?
-Dunno.

404
00:56:46,487 --> 00:56:49,126
The Pyrenees.
The kids have never seen snow.

405
00:56:49,127 --> 00:56:51,366
They've never been out of this part of town.

406
00:56:51,367 --> 00:56:53,926
We can camp.

407
00:56:53,927 --> 00:56:56,927
No, I'd rather have a dog, a little dog

408
00:56:57,767 --> 00:57:00,767
No, darling. They poo all day
and cost a fortune.

409
00:57:01,487 --> 00:57:04,446
Travelling's much more fun.
Give me a bit.

410
00:57:04,447 --> 00:57:07,447
I gotta taste it.

411
00:57:08,487 --> 00:57:11,486
-What are you doing, Marambra?
-Do you want to taste it?

412
00:57:11,487 --> 00:57:14,487
Use your spoon. Don't do that...
You're disgusting.

413
00:57:15,247 --> 00:57:18,247
-Good, eh?
-Wanna try?

414
00:57:18,407 --> 00:57:20,406
Do it.

415
00:57:20,407 --> 00:57:22,126
Stick your hand in.

416
00:57:22,127 --> 00:57:25,006
Once more.

417
00:57:25,007 --> 00:57:28,007
-Isn't that great?
-Stop it.

418
00:57:31,927 --> 00:57:34,927
What are you grumbling about?
Or don't you remember when you proposed to me?

419
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:37,926
What'd he do?

420
00:57:37,927 --> 00:57:40,927
If you're gonna tell the story
tell about the look you gave me.

421
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:45,167
You and your look.
I hadn't seen you yet.

422
00:57:45,247 --> 00:57:48,247
-Hadn't you ever seen me?
-I'm telling this, not you.

423
00:57:49,807 --> 00:57:52,807
The day I met your dad
at a party he said-

424
00:57:53,207 --> 00:57:56,207
-that I had the most beautiful nose he had ever seen.

425
00:57:57,647 --> 00:58:00,406
And obviously I believed him.

426
00:58:00,407 --> 00:58:03,407
Then he took my hand
to read my future.

427
00:58:04,487 --> 00:58:07,487
He said that I'd get married
to a completely hopeless man-

428
00:58:08,207 --> 00:58:10,646
-but that I'd be
truly loved.

429
00:58:10,647 --> 00:58:13,647
Who knows how many birds he'd
used that on, but it worked with me.

430
00:58:14,527 --> 00:58:17,527
He said that if I let go of his hand
it wouldn't come true.

431
00:58:18,447 --> 00:58:21,406
And straightaway,
befrore I knew what was happening-

432
00:58:21,407 --> 00:58:24,407
-he pulled my hand towards his nose-

433
00:58:25,487 --> 00:58:28,487
-and shoved my finger up his nostril.

434
00:58:29,727 --> 00:58:32,206
He dug out a booger
and lay it in my hand-

435
00:58:32,207 --> 00:58:35,207
-and said that I'd always have
part of him with me.

436
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:38,887
A black hairy piece of snot.
It was disgusting.

437
00:58:39,767 --> 00:58:41,806
So what are you whining about?

438
00:58:41,807 --> 00:58:44,807
It's not true.
Would you believe I'd do something like that?

439
00:59:32,287 --> 00:59:34,246
Whadda you want?

440
00:59:34,247 --> 00:59:37,247
Have you come to beg forgiveness?

441
00:59:40,567 --> 00:59:43,567
Money?
Don't give me any frigging money.

442
00:59:44,127 --> 00:59:46,486
Say sorry to them too.

443
00:59:46,487 --> 00:59:49,487
Just seeing you... if you hadn't had kids I'd have killed you.

444
00:59:50,767 --> 00:59:52,886
They knew what they were doing.

445
00:59:52,887 --> 00:59:55,887
They were illegals and they pushed drugs.

446
00:59:56,247 --> 00:59:59,247
Ekweme and the others knew they couldn't be here.

447
00:59:59,607 --> 01:00:01,926
The police won't allow it.

448
01:00:01,927 --> 01:00:04,686
Understand?

449
01:00:04,687 --> 01:00:07,687
Take the fucking money.

450
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:12,647
Me?
What'll I do with my kid?

451
01:00:14,567 --> 01:00:17,567
Dunno. Dunno.

452
01:02:39,967 --> 01:02:42,967
Here, drink this.

453
01:02:49,887 --> 01:02:51,886
How are things with your wife?

454
01:02:51,887 --> 01:02:54,406
OK. Better.

455
01:02:54,407 --> 01:02:57,407
-And the children?
-The kids are fine.

456
01:02:58,207 --> 01:03:00,406
And you?

457
01:03:00,407 --> 01:03:03,407
You're dying.

458
01:03:03,767 --> 01:03:06,086
Looks like it.

459
01:03:06,087 --> 01:03:09,087
Spit.

460
01:03:20,807 --> 01:03:22,926
How's life looking?

461
01:03:22,927 --> 01:03:25,927
Are you prepared to leave it?

462
01:03:26,487 --> 01:03:29,487
Yes, I think so.
I'm working on it.

463
01:03:29,927 --> 01:03:32,927
You think so?
You've got to be sure.

464
01:03:33,167 --> 01:03:35,966
Get your life in order.
Leave nothing undone.

465
01:03:35,967 --> 01:03:38,967
I don't want to die, Bea.

466
01:03:40,127 --> 01:03:43,127
I'm afraid
to leave the kids in the lurch.

467
01:03:43,647 --> 01:03:46,647
Do you believe that it's you
who looks after the children?

468
01:03:47,047 --> 01:03:50,006
Don't be naive, Uxbal.
The Universe looks after them.

469
01:03:50,007 --> 01:03:53,007
Yes, but the universe doesn't pay the rent.

470
01:03:56,687 --> 01:03:59,406
When I was Ana's age-

471
01:03:59,407 --> 01:04:02,407
-my mum died.
I scarcely remember her.

472
01:04:02,847 --> 01:04:05,847
My dad died without me ever meeting him.

473
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:10,286
That won't happen with my kids.

474
01:04:10,287 --> 01:04:13,287
Tell them.
Tell them everything.

475
01:04:14,167 --> 01:04:17,167
We know the dead'll never be in peace
if they're in debt to the living.

476
01:04:17,727 --> 01:04:20,727
Why is this happening to me?
Is it punishment?

477
01:04:22,407 --> 01:04:24,606
You can give up and let go-

478
01:04:24,607 --> 01:04:27,607
-or hang on like stupid people do.

479
01:04:28,247 --> 01:04:30,526
It's a long, strenuous journey, Uxbal.

480
01:04:30,527 --> 01:04:33,527
Death is not the end, you know that.

481
01:04:34,447 --> 01:04:37,326
I won't die, Bea.

482
01:04:37,327 --> 01:04:40,327
No.

483
01:04:42,007 --> 01:04:45,007
No.

484
01:04:49,047 --> 01:04:52,047
Yes, you will die.

485
01:04:52,887 --> 01:04:55,887
I see it
and there's nothing I can do.

486
01:04:56,927 --> 01:04:59,927
Put your life in order, Uxbal.
That's all that matters.

487
01:05:02,767 --> 01:05:05,767
Chemo's poison.

488
01:05:17,447 --> 01:05:20,006
What did you have for breakfast?

489
01:05:20,007 --> 01:05:23,007
Milk coffee.

490
01:05:26,567 --> 01:05:29,567
You've always been a handsome boy.

491
01:05:30,007 --> 01:05:33,007
Remember what I said
the day we met?

492
01:05:33,247 --> 01:05:36,247
That we got our free gift-

493
01:05:36,847 --> 01:05:39,847
-so we'll pass it on.

494
01:05:46,047 --> 01:05:47,486
Here.

495
01:05:47,487 --> 01:05:50,046
When it's necessary,
give them to the children.


496
01:05:50,047 --> 01:05:52,926
-What is it?
-For protection.

497
01:05:52,927 --> 01:05:55,526
When you leave them-

498
01:05:55,527 --> 01:05:58,527
-give them one each.

499
01:06:20,927 --> 01:06:23,927
He said it felt like
a sea of mud inside him.

500
01:06:25,007 --> 01:06:27,966
And his eyes felt like jelly-

501
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:30,967
-and his hair burnt.

502
01:07:15,567 --> 01:07:18,567
Everybody up. It's 6.30.

503
01:07:34,647 --> 01:07:37,647
-How many stoves did Uxbal bring?
-Six.

504
01:07:48,447 --> 01:07:50,606
How's Ana?

505
01:07:50,607 --> 01:07:52,566
Hi, Lili.

506
01:07:52,567 --> 01:07:55,406
How're things?

507
01:07:55,407 --> 01:07:58,407
I hope the stoves'll stop you from freezing.

508
01:07:59,327 --> 01:08:01,646
Ana feels fine.
She wants to meet you.

509
01:08:01,647 --> 01:08:04,647
We've moved in with her mother
.... she misses you.

510
01:08:05,087 --> 01:08:08,087
I miss her too.
She loves to play with Li.

511
01:08:11,167 --> 01:08:14,167
Uxbal, Hai wants to talk to you.

512
01:08:16,447 --> 01:08:19,447
-See you, Lili.
-'Bye. Say goodbye.

513
01:08:21,727 --> 01:08:23,366
Not one more day.

514
01:08:23,367 --> 01:08:26,367
If you want to have them sew 16 hours
a day and exploit them as

515
01:08:26,967 --> 01:08:29,486
-Exploit them?
-Yes, exploit them.

516
01:08:29,487 --> 01:08:32,286
D'you know how much they earn in China?

517
01:08:32,287 --> 01:08:34,486
Half a dollar a day.

518
01:08:34,487 --> 01:08:37,487
Millions of Chinese'd suck my cock
every morning to be here

519
01:08:38,327 --> 01:08:41,286
You forget I negotiated
a salary for each worker.

520
01:08:41,287 --> 01:08:44,287
And I can see down there they're obviously getting fuck-all.

521
01:08:46,047 --> 01:08:48,046
But I don't give a stuff about that.

522
01:08:48,047 --> 01:08:51,047
Just give me my share, like we agreed.


523
01:08:51,447 --> 01:08:53,606
Agreed to what?

524
01:08:53,607 --> 01:08:55,766
Agreed to what?

525
01:08:55,767 --> 01:08:57,606
You fucking piece of rotten meat!

526
01:08:57,607 --> 01:09:00,286
It's my money, you cunt!

527
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:02,566
It's mine!

528
01:09:02,567 --> 01:09:05,567
It's my money for fuck's sake!
Mine!

529
01:09:15,007 --> 01:09:18,007
Fucking blood-sucker. 
If you don't starve to death it's due to me.

530
01:09:18,967 --> 01:09:21,166
If the Chinese have work
it's thanks to me.

531
01:09:21,167 --> 01:09:23,886
If you two aren't locked up
it's thanks to me.

532
01:09:23,887 --> 01:09:26,887
If you don't give me half
of Mendozas money, I swear I'll...

533
01:09:27,567 --> 01:09:30,567
What'll you do?
Who d'you think you are?

534
01:09:31,127 --> 01:09:34,127
You turn everything to your own advantage

535
01:09:34,207 --> 01:09:37,207
Uxbal...

536
01:10:16,927 --> 01:10:19,927
They're putting me out in the morning.
You gotta stay at Samuel's.

537
01:10:21,007 --> 01:10:23,926
-We're not staying without you.
-Samuel's a Spaniard...

538
01:10:23,927 --> 01:10:26,927
Samuel's Senegalese like me.
We go back with you.

539
01:10:29,167 --> 01:10:32,167
We'll be together again.
We're still young.

540
01:10:33,167 --> 01:10:35,486
Stay.

541
01:10:35,487 --> 01:10:37,366
Stay here at his place
 and go on studying.


542
01:10:37,367 --> 01:10:40,367
Work at the chicken factory again.
I send money to you.

543
01:10:41,527 --> 01:10:44,527
Even if I chop off a million chicken heads-

544
01:10:46,047 --> 01:10:49,047
-we can never afford a house here.
We don't belong here.

545
01:10:49,207 --> 01:10:52,207
Why would you go back
to Senegal?

546
01:10:52,327 --> 01:10:55,327
There's no work at all.

547
01:11:05,567 --> 01:11:08,567
A man from the police came.

548
01:11:08,767 --> 01:11:11,767
He said we're all being evicted.
Everyone. They gave us til Monday.

549
01:11:14,287 --> 01:11:17,246
Uxbal 'll fix it.

550
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:19,446
I trust him.

551
01:11:19,447 --> 01:11:22,447
I've already spoken to him.

552
01:11:24,367 --> 01:11:27,367
Let him help us.

553
01:11:48,567 --> 01:11:51,246
Hi.

554
01:11:51,247 --> 01:11:54,247
Why're you looking like that?
What's happened to you?

555
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:57,727
Why'd you do it?
You needn't 've gone overboard.

556
01:12:00,167 --> 01:12:03,167
Is that why you asked me to come?
To scold me?

557
01:12:06,367 --> 01:12:09,367
What could've I done?
They do what the fuck they want.

558
01:12:10,647 --> 01:12:12,366
What were you thinking?

559
01:12:12,367 --> 01:12:15,367
Were you the only one who didn't know
they were drug pushers?

560
01:12:15,447 --> 01:12:18,447
I warned you Uxbal.
We had to stop the niggers.

561
01:12:20,007 --> 01:12:23,007
The money is not enough for everyone.
Should I live on my miserable salary?

562
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:26,926
Or will you steal from me?

563
01:12:26,927 --> 01:12:29,927
They're being pushed out.
There are women with little kids...

564
01:12:30,367 --> 01:12:33,367
-You aren't Mother Teresa.
-You know what I mean.

565
01:12:33,687 --> 01:12:36,687
It's you who exploit them
so don't give us that shit.

566
01:12:37,007 --> 01:12:40,007
I don't exploit them.
I help them get a job.

567
01:12:41,047 --> 01:12:43,686
For money, like all the others.

568
01:12:43,687 --> 01:12:46,086
-Want something?
-No thanks.

569
01:12:46,087 --> 01:12:48,886
Do you remember Victor, Julia's son?

570
01:12:48,887 --> 01:12:51,887
He moved to Murcia to train tigers
 in a circus. He gave them food.

571
01:12:53,567 --> 01:12:55,966
They danced for him 
and licked his face.

572
01:12:55,967 --> 01:12:58,526
I saw the show
with my daughter.

573
01:12:58,527 --> 01:13:01,527
She wanted to bring a tiger home
They seemed to love him.

574
01:13:03,687 --> 01:13:06,206
The other month
I met his mum.

575
01:13:06,207 --> 01:13:09,207
A tiger had torn off a piece
of his face and killed him.

576
01:13:10,847 --> 01:13:13,847
He gave them food every day.
Every day for six years.

577
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:18,007
But he made a mistake.

578
01:13:18,567 --> 01:13:21,567
It's dangerous
to trust a starving man.

579
01:13:22,007 --> 01:13:24,366
'Specially if his kids are starving too.

580
01:13:24,367 --> 01:13:27,367
-What's that got to do with anything?
-What the fuck are you on about?

581
01:13:27,847 --> 01:13:30,847
You gotta help Ekweme.
He's being kicked out. You gotta help me.

582
01:13:32,047 --> 01:13:35,047
I'm not an MP.
I can't help you.

583
01:13:36,607 --> 01:13:39,607
I can't go on playing I'm the UN.

584
01:13:40,527 --> 01:13:43,527
I've got a daughter to look after.
D'you understand?

585
01:13:51,527 --> 01:13:54,527
Be careful, Uxbal.

586
01:13:55,447 --> 01:13:58,446
Or take an Alka Seltzer.
Chinese food can be very strong.

587
01:13:58,447 --> 01:14:00,086
There are so many of those yellow bastards-

588
01:14:00,087 --> 01:14:03,087
-that in the end they'll have the best ham
and we'll get to eat rice.

589
01:14:34,727 --> 01:14:36,606
Daddy, did you know-

590
01:14:36,607 --> 01:14:39,607
-that when owls die
they cough up a fur-ball?

591
01:14:40,287 --> 01:14:43,287
No, I didn't know that.
Not so loud, you'll wake up Mummy.

592
01:14:44,527 --> 01:14:47,526
Daddy, is mummy mad at us?

593
01:14:47,527 --> 01:14:50,527
No.

594
01:14:51,287 --> 01:14:53,086
Who's that?

595
01:14:53,087 --> 01:14:55,606
-Your grandfather.
-Let me see.

596
01:14:55,607 --> 01:14:58,607
That was the last photo taken of him
before he went off.


597
01:14:58,887 --> 01:15:01,887
My mum always kept it in her purse.

598
01:15:02,567 --> 01:15:05,046
Where'd he go to?

599
01:15:05,047 --> 01:15:06,886
To Mexico.

600
01:15:06,887 --> 01:15:09,887
-He didn't just go, he fled.
-Why'd he flee?

601
01:15:10,247 --> 01:15:13,247
'cause your grandfather 
couldn't keep his mouth shut.

602
01:15:13,767 --> 01:15:16,767
At that time Franco persecuted and executed people
who couldn't keep their mouth shut.

603
01:15:20,407 --> 01:15:23,407
When he was 20 he fled from Spain
so as not to die-

604
01:15:25,367 --> 01:15:28,367
-but he died anyway 2 weeks later in Mexico
from a lung inflammation.

605
01:15:29,047 --> 01:15:32,047
Do you love him a lot?

606
01:15:34,007 --> 01:15:37,007
I don't know.
I never met him.

607
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:41,367
Not having a dad sucks.

608
01:15:43,527 --> 01:15:46,527
When are we going up to see the snow?
Mummy said we're taking the train.

609
01:15:47,687 --> 01:15:50,046
-Bags a window-seat.
-OK.

610
01:15:50,047 --> 01:15:51,686
If we're going up to the snow-

611
01:15:51,687 --> 01:15:54,687
-you gotta build up your strength
'cause there are tons of things to do.

612
01:15:55,847 --> 01:15:58,847
Sleeping time.

613
01:16:02,167 --> 01:16:05,167
Careful, It's heavy.

614
01:16:26,567 --> 01:16:29,567
Fuck it, it's sealed with zinc.

615
01:16:30,447 --> 01:16:33,447
Pass me the hammer and chisel.

616
01:16:39,647 --> 01:16:42,246
Fuck, he's embalmed.

617
01:16:42,247 --> 01:16:43,926
We take it as it is.

618
01:16:43,927 --> 01:16:46,927
...placed the remains
of Mateo Gama Fernandez-

619
01:16:47,247 --> 01:16:50,247
-in department 27
Saint Joseph year 1966.

620
01:16:51,247 --> 01:16:53,646
Wonderful. Everything in order.

621
01:16:53,647 --> 01:16:55,646
Your father died in Mexico.

622
01:16:55,647 --> 01:16:58,647
Therefore he was embalmed
before being sent back here by sea.

623
01:16:59,207 --> 01:17:01,966
I'm telling you this because the formaldehyde really works-

624
01:17:01,967 --> 01:17:04,326
-and cremation can take a long time.

625
01:17:04,327 --> 01:17:07,327
The body's driven
to Montjuic crematorium.

626
01:17:07,887 --> 01:17:10,887
I suppose you'll want an urn.

627
01:17:13,247 --> 01:17:16,247
These are his belongings.
They were in the coffin.

628
01:17:19,087 --> 01:17:22,087
Can we see the body?

629
01:17:22,127 --> 01:17:25,127
If you want, but people tend not to....

630
01:17:26,927 --> 01:17:29,927
But if you wish
I'll call Montjuic right away.

631
01:17:36,447 --> 01:17:39,447
Tony, please open the bag for identification.

632
01:19:36,127 --> 01:19:39,046
Sorry, the door was open.

633
01:19:39,047 --> 01:19:42,047
I'm coming now.

634
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:51,367
Sometimes the fridge hums-

635
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:54,807
-but if you give it a bang it'll stop.

636
01:19:56,007 --> 01:19:57,846
There's hot water-

637
01:19:57,847 --> 01:20:00,847
-but it's best to shower after 10 o'clock. OK??

638
01:20:02,447 --> 01:20:04,726
I think that's everything.

639
01:20:04,727 --> 01:20:07,727
Kids' room.

640
01:20:08,607 --> 01:20:11,006
If you like you can be in here.

641
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:14,007
The rent is paid for the next few months.

642
01:20:23,847 --> 01:20:26,847
Fuck...

643
01:20:36,327 --> 01:20:39,327
Are you...

644
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:42,367
Are you OK?

645
01:21:18,687 --> 01:21:21,687
I didn't know you did massage customers
in the middle of the night.

646
01:21:22,007 --> 01:21:24,646
You scared me.

647
01:21:24,647 --> 01:21:27,166
You should see the sky.

648
01:21:27,167 --> 01:21:30,167
It's full of stars.

649
01:21:31,487 --> 01:21:34,126
It's a damned nuisance that ants
always come in here.

650
01:21:34,127 --> 01:21:37,127
Ana said you caught them by smoking
and the mattress caught on fire.

651
01:21:38,807 --> 01:21:41,807
-Where have you been?
-Can't I have a bit of fun?

652
01:21:42,487 --> 01:21:45,366
Not with 2 children alone at home-

653
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:47,806
-who don't know where you are.
And dressed like that.

654
01:21:47,807 --> 01:21:50,807
So it's my fault? 
Now I gotta ask your permission to be Mummy.

655
01:21:51,807 --> 01:21:54,406
That's what happens 
when a seven year old smokes.

656
01:21:54,407 --> 01:21:57,006
Things start to burn.
Or didn't you know Mateo smoked?

657
01:21:57,007 --> 01:22:00,007
You can't leave them, nor can you throw
a burning mattress out the window-

658
01:22:01,047 --> 01:22:04,047
-and make them carry it up.
He's only seven.

659
01:22:04,967 --> 01:22:07,967
But he can already hurt others
like he was 40.

660
01:22:10,647 --> 01:22:13,647
He wanted to open the fridge ...

661
01:22:14,167 --> 01:22:17,167
...with wet feet.

662
01:22:20,607 --> 01:22:23,607
And he called me a whore.

663
01:22:26,007 --> 01:22:29,007
The more love I give him-

664
01:22:29,167 --> 01:22:32,167
-the more he calls me nasty names.

665
01:22:34,327 --> 01:22:37,327
He said it was my fault
that we separated.

666
01:22:38,767 --> 01:22:41,086
Did you hit him?

667
01:22:41,087 --> 01:22:44,087
No.

668
01:22:49,287 --> 01:22:52,287
Yes you did.

669
01:22:58,567 --> 01:23:01,567
It's the only way he'll learn.

670
01:23:15,327 --> 01:23:18,327
I bought the train tickets.

671
01:23:18,967 --> 01:23:21,967
Four seats in first class.

672
01:23:22,807 --> 01:23:25,807
I found a cute B&B
where we can spend the night.

673
01:23:28,247 --> 01:23:31,247
The kids are so looking forward to the trip.

674
01:23:31,527 --> 01:23:34,446
They talk about the Pyrenees-

675
01:23:34,447 --> 01:23:37,447
-like they were Disneyland.

676
01:23:40,407 --> 01:23:43,407
My darling one, what you see ou there are not stars.


677
01:23:44,487 --> 01:23:47,487
It's your nervous system.

678
01:23:50,127 --> 01:23:53,127
You could at least show you care.

679
01:24:55,047 --> 01:24:58,047
We're ruined.

680
01:24:59,847 --> 01:25:02,847
Finished.

681
01:25:03,247 --> 01:25:06,046
We could have...

682
01:25:06,047 --> 01:25:08,766
Shut up. It was your idea.

683
01:25:08,767 --> 01:25:11,767
What's happened? Where are they?

684
01:25:12,047 --> 01:25:14,886
-Where are they?
-You fucking piece of shit!

685
01:25:14,887 --> 01:25:17,806
-You fucking murderer!
-Shut up!

686
01:25:17,807 --> 01:25:20,807
-It was your idea too.
-We gotta scram.

687
01:25:21,287 --> 01:25:24,287
-I don't wanna end up in jail.
-No one ever does.

688
01:25:24,687 --> 01:25:27,687
Where are they?

689
01:25:29,767 --> 01:25:32,767
Down there in the cellar.

690
01:25:33,687 --> 01:25:36,566
We gotta decide what to do
with the one that's alive.

691
01:25:36,567 --> 01:25:38,846
There's one that's alive?

692
01:25:38,847 --> 01:25:41,847
There were two, but we couldn't...
One of them died.

693
01:25:42,327 --> 01:25:44,726
Could be seen as suicide.

694
01:25:44,727 --> 01:25:47,646
Promise me no one will know anything.

695
01:25:47,647 --> 01:25:50,647
I'll give you all the money you need.
Just say how much.

696
01:26:56,487 --> 01:26:59,487
Help me, help me!.

697
01:27:01,047 --> 01:27:03,886
What are you doing?

698
01:27:03,887 --> 01:27:05,006
Help me!

699
01:27:05,007 --> 01:27:08,007
Uxbal, leave her alone.
She's already dead.

700
01:29:08,567 --> 01:29:11,086
What'll we do?

701
01:29:11,087 --> 01:29:13,886
You gotta help me.

702
01:29:13,887 --> 01:29:16,887
I don't know.
Lock the goddamned warehouse.

703
01:29:30,367 --> 01:29:33,367
Hang on, Marambra.
Dear Marambra, listen to me.

704
01:29:34,007 --> 01:29:36,326
Listen to me.

705
01:29:36,327 --> 01:29:38,966
Take the train this evening,
and we'll see in the morning.

706
01:29:38,967 --> 01:29:41,806
Don't change the plan.
Don't change a fucking thing.

707
01:29:41,807 --> 01:29:44,807
Take the kids
and go to the Pyrenees

708
01:29:46,607 --> 01:29:49,607
Tell Ana I'm sorry,
but we'll have her birthday party when she comes home.

709
01:30:22,767 --> 01:30:25,767
I tried to pray, but I don't know 
who I should pray to.

710
01:30:27,167 --> 01:30:30,167
Haven't you slept at all?
Out with it.

711
01:30:33,647 --> 01:30:36,647
I bought the damned stoves
because they were cheapest.

712
01:30:39,367 --> 01:30:42,367
Because I needed 
the goddamned money.

713
01:30:44,167 --> 01:30:47,167
I knew the stoves were rejects.

714
01:30:48,527 --> 01:30:51,527
It's my fault, Bea.
All my fault...

715
01:31:04,727 --> 01:31:07,727
They're all dead.

716
01:31:11,247 --> 01:31:14,247
25 people, Bea.
There were women there.

717
01:31:16,607 --> 01:31:19,607
And children...
Lili was there.

718
01:31:19,887 --> 01:31:22,887
I wanted to ask her to forgive me,
but she was already dead.

719
01:31:26,647 --> 01:31:29,647
I don't know if I'm going to the police. 
I'm really frightened...

720
01:31:31,207 --> 01:31:34,207
It was an accident, Uxbal.

721
01:31:34,727 --> 01:31:37,727
It's OK.

722
01:31:39,007 --> 01:31:42,007
You know what you must do, Uxbal.

723
01:31:43,687 --> 01:31:46,406
Go and find them-

724
01:31:46,407 --> 01:31:48,086
-and beg their forgiveness.

725
01:31:48,087 --> 01:31:51,046
No, not that...

726
01:31:51,047 --> 01:31:54,047
Not that...

727
01:35:01,127 --> 01:35:02,886
Tito...

728
01:35:02,887 --> 01:35:04,886
Where's the prodigal son.

729
01:35:04,887 --> 01:35:07,286
What's up with you?
I've been trying to get hold of you.

730
01:35:07,287 --> 01:35:10,287
I left a thousand messages.


731
01:35:12,567 --> 01:35:15,567
Why don't you answer when I call?
Come here.

732
01:35:16,207 --> 01:35:19,207
This is my out-of-reach brother.

733
01:35:19,607 --> 01:35:21,366
What will you have to drink?

734
01:35:21,367 --> 01:35:23,206
-Dunno.
-Cclara!

735
01:35:23,207 --> 01:35:26,207
Mendoza went ballistic.
He nearly cut my balls off.

736
01:35:26,287 --> 01:35:29,287
Cclara, give me one...two Jack Daniel's.

737
01:35:29,727 --> 01:35:32,727
None of the Chinese came to work.
These sort of delays cost a fortune.

738
01:35:33,247 --> 01:35:36,086
-What happened?
-There was a problem, Tito.

739
01:35:36,087 --> 01:35:39,087
What the hell?
Why didn't you come to me?

740
01:35:39,887 --> 01:35:41,966
Because... I don't know.

741
01:35:41,967 --> 01:35:44,806
Come here, Cclarita.

742
01:35:44,807 --> 01:35:47,807
Drink, we'll discuss this in the morning.

743
01:35:47,847 --> 01:35:50,847
Hang on...
I've got to talk to you, Tito.

744
01:35:51,527 --> 01:35:54,486
Here you gotta scream 
or be on top of one another.

745
01:35:54,487 --> 01:35:57,487
Look at her there.

746
01:36:02,887 --> 01:36:05,126
Wow, you've got a thirst.

747
01:36:05,127 --> 01:36:07,486
Look behind me. The bird in pink.

748
01:36:07,487 --> 01:36:10,487
I've fucked her up the arse.
She loves to fuck.

749
01:36:11,767 --> 01:36:13,886
She's only a little girl.

750
01:36:13,887 --> 01:36:16,887
Cheers!

751
01:36:19,927 --> 01:36:22,927
I've got nothing.

752
01:36:29,567 --> 01:36:32,567
Here it is.

753
01:36:33,527 --> 01:36:36,527
Is Cchepas here?

754
01:36:38,007 --> 01:36:41,007
What's up with you?
Look at him.

755
01:36:41,647 --> 01:36:44,646
How long is it since you were out?

756
01:36:44,647 --> 01:36:47,647
It was at least 2 years ago.
Look at him now.

757
01:36:47,887 --> 01:36:50,726
He looks like the fucking Dalai Lama.

758
01:36:50,727 --> 01:36:53,727
Hrere.

759
01:37:00,407 --> 01:37:03,407
Hi darling.

760
01:37:08,407 --> 01:37:11,407
No, don't give him anything.

761
01:37:11,527 --> 01:37:13,886
Let him suffer.

762
01:37:13,887 --> 01:37:16,887
Look at him.

763
01:37:18,367 --> 01:37:21,367
Now we can talk.
Do you want a drink?

764
01:37:23,447 --> 01:37:26,447
Get Cchepa's stuff.
I'm going to the loo.

765
01:37:26,567 --> 01:37:29,567
-Are you hungry for adventure, girls?
-How come? We know you're gay.

766
01:37:36,487 --> 01:37:39,326
Your brother's an idiot.
Do you know that?

767
01:37:39,327 --> 01:37:42,327
-Your brother's an idiot.
-Yeah.

768
01:37:42,567 --> 01:37:45,567
Yeah, he sure is.

769
01:37:47,207 --> 01:37:50,207
And how many kids do you have?

770
01:37:51,487 --> 01:37:54,206
-How many kids do you have?
-Two.

771
01:37:54,207 --> 01:37:57,086
-Where are they now?
-They've gone away.

772
01:37:57,087 --> 01:37:58,646
They've gone up to the snow.

773
01:37:58,647 --> 01:38:01,406
-Who with?
-With their mum.

774
01:38:01,407 --> 01:38:04,407
-Why didn't you go with them?
-'cause I can't.

775
01:38:07,687 --> 01:38:09,806
Why can't you?

776
01:38:09,807 --> 01:38:12,366
Why can't you?

777
01:38:12,367 --> 01:38:15,367
Because I'm dying.

778
01:38:20,607 --> 01:38:23,607
I'm dying of cancer.

779
01:40:48,287 --> 01:40:51,287
PYRENEES IS BlUTlFUL

780
01:41:18,287 --> 01:41:21,287
Mateo, my sweet?

781
01:41:29,047 --> 01:41:31,606
Mateo.

782
01:41:31,607 --> 01:41:34,166
kiddo...

783
01:41:34,167 --> 01:41:37,167
Why are you all alone?

784
01:41:38,687 --> 01:41:41,086
I wet myself.

785
01:41:41,087 --> 01:41:44,087
Don't worry about that.

786
01:41:44,207 --> 01:41:47,006
What happened?

787
01:41:47,007 --> 01:41:50,007
Mamma punished me.

788
01:41:51,007 --> 01:41:54,007
She left me here.
She went off with Ana.

789
01:41:55,007 --> 01:41:58,007
They went up to the snow.

790
01:42:00,287 --> 01:42:03,287
What have you done to your face?

791
01:42:04,087 --> 01:42:07,087
I was very disobedient.

792
01:42:22,327 --> 01:42:25,327
Daddy...

793
01:42:31,727 --> 01:42:34,727
Daddy...

794
01:42:42,927 --> 01:42:45,326
Let me explain.

795
01:42:45,327 --> 01:42:48,327
-It was Ana's birthday and Mateo...
-Don't talk to me, Marambra.

796
01:43:07,567 --> 01:43:10,567
It's good you're moving.

797
01:43:12,247 --> 01:43:15,247
I'm really glad you're pissing off.
You hear that?

798
01:43:17,647 --> 01:43:20,086
Goddamned pig.

799
01:43:20,087 --> 01:43:23,087
You're a goddamned pig!
You can't even look at me, eh?

800
01:43:29,687 --> 01:43:32,687
Give me the photo, Marambra.

801
01:45:46,047 --> 01:45:49,047
His dad.

802
01:45:59,367 --> 01:46:02,367
Tell him to be quiet.
Quieten him.

803
01:46:03,127 --> 01:46:06,127
Sleep now, Mateo.

804
01:46:08,127 --> 01:46:11,127
Daddy, Why is Ige living at our place?

805
01:46:12,847 --> 01:46:15,847
'Cause he doesn't have any home of his own.

806
01:46:16,167 --> 01:46:18,166
And he has a little kid.

807
01:46:18,167 --> 01:46:21,167
-Can I answer?
-No, as I've already told you.

808
01:47:49,327 --> 01:47:51,726
Where are the kids?

809
01:47:51,727 --> 01:47:54,046
I followed them to school.

810
01:47:54,047 --> 01:47:57,047
-Why didn't you wake me up?
-You slept like a log.

811
01:47:57,887 --> 01:48:00,887
Ana said she knew the way
and Mateo thought it was OK.

812
01:48:04,327 --> 01:48:06,086
What time is it?

813
01:48:06,087 --> 01:48:09,087
I don't know, it must be one.

814
01:48:16,927 --> 01:48:19,927
If you like, I can pick up the kids.

815
01:49:01,447 --> 01:49:04,447
He went ballistic.

816
01:49:04,767 --> 01:49:07,767
Liwei betrayed me.
Everything was his idea.

817
01:49:09,087 --> 01:49:12,087
You know what sort of a guy he was.

818
01:49:14,847 --> 01:49:17,847
He threw them in, 300 metres out to sea.

819
01:49:18,127 --> 01:49:21,127
Shimuya swore
that the bodies sank to the bottom.

820
01:49:22,807 --> 01:49:25,807
Liwei thought you'd betray us. 
I was afraid too.

821
01:49:27,487 --> 01:49:30,487
They've taken my family.
My daughter Suyin.

822
01:49:30,607 --> 01:49:33,406
To top it all off, Liwei came
looking for me and cried.

823
01:49:33,407 --> 01:49:36,407
This is insane.
What do you want me to do?

824
01:49:36,807 --> 01:49:39,807
What do you want me to do?

825
01:49:40,527 --> 01:49:43,527
We can't stand here.
Get away from here and be quick about it.

826
01:49:45,567 --> 01:49:48,006
-What do you want?
-You aren't innocent, Uxbal.

827
01:49:48,007 --> 01:49:51,007
-What?
-Don't play dumb.

828
01:49:56,727 --> 01:49:59,727
You gotta get it into your head.

829
01:50:00,967 --> 01:50:03,967
My people don't squeal.
I promise you.

830
01:50:04,887 --> 01:50:07,887
You gotta shut up anyone you know 
who knows anything.

831
01:50:32,087 --> 01:50:35,087
<i>The news has shocked the whole country.</i>

832
01:50:35,847 --> 01:50:38,847
<i>The latest we know is
that most of the dead are men-</i>

833
01:50:39,567 --> 01:50:42,567
<i>-but among them were also found 
two women and three children.</i>

834
01:50:44,247 --> 01:50:47,247
<i>We warn that these images may disturb some viewers.
The search for bodies continues...</i>

835
01:50:48,007 --> 01:50:50,286
No, I don't know.

836
01:50:50,287 --> 01:50:53,086
It's not certain.
No, it's not certain.

837
01:50:53,087 --> 01:50:56,087
What? No.

838
01:50:56,287 --> 01:50:59,287
Near the Chinese's warehouse.
I don't know.

839
01:51:00,367 --> 01:51:03,367
One family or something.
Just a sec, there's someone at the door.

840
01:51:04,207 --> 01:51:07,207
No, no, no, don't hang up.

841
01:51:08,727 --> 01:51:11,726
What the hell are you doing here?

842
01:51:11,727 --> 01:51:14,727
-I heard it right.
-Why didn't you say anything to me?

843
01:51:14,967 --> 01:51:17,086
-Are we talking about the same thing?
-I dunno.

844
01:51:17,087 --> 01:51:20,087
Are we talking about the same thing?
This is terrible.

845
01:51:21,887 --> 01:51:24,887
Want a drink?

846
01:51:24,927 --> 01:51:26,766
-Marambras purse?
-Leave it alone.

847
01:51:26,767 --> 01:51:29,767
I don't understand.
Did you murder them, Uxbal?

848
01:51:30,367 --> 01:51:32,366
-Fucking piece of shit.
-For chrissakes, Uxbal...

849
01:51:32,367 --> 01:51:35,367
Fucking piece of shit.

850
01:51:37,607 --> 01:51:40,607
<i>He was totally hysterical and stood and cried.
</i>

851
01:51:41,367 --> 01:51:44,367
What was I supposed to do?
Leave her out there?

852
01:51:45,127 --> 01:51:48,127
This is partly your fault, Uxbal.

853
01:51:48,687 --> 01:51:51,687
If I see you anywhere near
my wife or my children-

854
01:51:52,927 --> 01:51:55,927
-under a kilometre away,
I swear on my mother-

855
01:51:56,647 --> 01:51:59,647
-I'll kill you, you fucking piece of shit.

856
01:52:25,847 --> 01:52:28,847
I can't move.

857
01:52:29,887 --> 01:52:32,887
I feel like if I touched my neck-

858
01:52:33,087 --> 01:52:35,486
-my head would fall off.

859
01:52:35,487 --> 01:52:38,487
Calm down. Nothing's
gonna fall off.

860
01:52:40,807 --> 01:52:43,406
If I close my eyes-

861
01:52:43,407 --> 01:52:46,407
-the tanks are coming.

862
01:52:47,087 --> 01:52:50,087
They scare  me.

863
01:52:50,847 --> 01:52:53,847
I called you.
I rang you over and over.

864
01:52:55,807 --> 01:52:58,807
I don't have what the children need.

865
01:53:01,007 --> 01:53:04,007
I'm sorry I was nasty to Mateo.

866
01:53:07,487 --> 01:53:10,487
I do what I can
to survive.

867
01:53:12,487 --> 01:53:15,487
I want to be faithful to you.

868
01:53:15,847 --> 01:53:18,847
But i also want to have a bit of fun ...

869
01:53:19,207 --> 01:53:21,166
...as a whore.

870
01:53:21,167 --> 01:53:24,167
Don't say that, Marambra.

871
01:53:26,247 --> 01:53:29,126
I'm sorry.

872
01:53:29,127 --> 01:53:31,566
I never knew 
what I should give you.

873
01:53:31,567 --> 01:53:34,566
I still don't know.

874
01:53:34,567 --> 01:53:37,567
Come to think of it...
I've never known it

875
01:53:39,487 --> 01:53:42,487
But we've hurt each other so much.

876
01:53:42,887 --> 01:53:45,887
Take me on a holiday again.

877
01:53:46,527 --> 01:53:49,326
At the clinic
they have to tie me...

878
01:53:49,327 --> 01:53:51,486
Quiet.

879
01:53:51,487 --> 01:53:54,487
Quiet. It'll be OK
It's going to be OK.

880
01:57:04,447 --> 01:57:07,447
She is in the same house
where we visited her before.

881
01:57:08,447 --> 01:57:10,366
Remember?

882
01:57:10,367 --> 01:57:12,646
And she...

883
01:57:12,647 --> 01:57:15,647
We must just let her rest.

884
01:57:16,087 --> 01:57:18,966
-Take her hand?
-Yes.

885
01:57:18,967 --> 01:57:21,967
She has 20 people
who take her hand.

886
01:57:25,847 --> 01:57:28,847
She sent lots of kisses.
She loves you lots and lots.

887
01:57:33,287 --> 01:57:36,287
-Can we say hello to her?
-Yes, of course darling.

888
01:57:36,647 --> 01:57:39,647
But now we have to let her rest.

889
01:57:59,687 --> 01:58:02,687
Make a wish, little lady.

890
01:58:12,287 --> 01:58:15,086
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

891
01:58:15,087 --> 01:58:18,087
-Don't shove it up your nose.
-Give me your hand.

892
01:58:20,087 --> 01:58:23,087
What's that? A booger?

893
01:58:26,207 --> 01:58:29,207
It's something you shall have 
from your daddy.


894
01:58:32,367 --> 01:58:35,367
Are you scared of it?

895
01:58:35,647 --> 01:58:38,647
Do you promise?

896
01:58:39,807 --> 01:58:42,807
-Are you frightened of it?
-Yes.

897
01:58:44,367 --> 01:58:47,367
Shouldn't we have the cake now?
Sit down , Ige.

898
01:58:48,007 --> 01:58:49,846
OK...

899
01:58:49,847 --> 01:58:52,646
The first thing we must do...

900
01:58:52,647 --> 01:58:55,166
Mateo, don't be disgusting.

901
01:58:55,167 --> 01:58:58,167
...is to eat
yummy chocolate cake.

902
01:59:08,127 --> 01:59:11,127
The kids are so fond of you Ige.

903
01:59:11,247 --> 01:59:14,247
You and Samuel.

904
01:59:15,647 --> 01:59:18,647
You have a home here.
And you can stay as long as you want.

905
01:59:19,967 --> 01:59:22,967
No, Uxbal.
I'm also fond of the children-

906
01:59:24,647 --> 01:59:27,647
-but I'll save up some money
and then I'm going back.

907
01:59:29,167 --> 01:59:31,726
This is no place for us.

908
01:59:31,727 --> 01:59:34,727
Ekweme told me about...

909
01:59:36,767 --> 01:59:39,767
Wait.

910
01:59:50,807 --> 01:59:53,807
Here is enough for rent for a whole year-

911
01:59:54,767 --> 01:59:57,006
-and much more.

912
01:59:57,007 --> 02:00:00,007
All for the children.
Do you understand?

913
02:00:02,287 --> 02:00:05,287
Take the money.

914
02:00:06,847 --> 02:00:09,847
Take them.

915
02:00:12,047 --> 02:00:15,046
Ige, please...

916
02:00:15,047 --> 02:00:17,486
Can't you stay?

917
02:00:17,487 --> 02:00:20,487
I need your help.

918
02:00:20,927 --> 02:00:23,927
Take it now. Take it.

919
02:00:40,367 --> 02:00:43,367
Goddamn...

920
02:00:52,607 --> 02:00:54,446
What is it?

921
02:00:54,447 --> 02:00:56,806
Nothing.

922
02:00:56,807 --> 02:00:59,807
-Why aren't you in school?
-Don't lie to me Daddy.

923
02:01:10,927 --> 02:01:13,927
Come here.

924
02:01:25,207 --> 02:01:28,207
Does your brother know anything about this?

925
02:01:32,967 --> 02:01:35,967
You can't leave us.

926
02:01:38,087 --> 02:01:41,087
I won't.

927
02:01:46,727 --> 02:01:49,727
Look in my eyes.

928
02:01:50,807 --> 02:01:53,807
Look at my face.

929
02:01:54,527 --> 02:01:57,527
Promise to remember me.

930
02:01:57,567 --> 02:02:00,526
Don't forget me, Ana.

931
02:02:00,527 --> 02:02:03,527
Don't forget me, my darling.

932
02:03:45,807 --> 02:03:48,807
'Bye.

933
02:04:55,967 --> 02:04:58,967
Ige?

934
02:05:00,727 --> 02:05:03,727
Ige?

935
02:05:03,767 --> 02:05:06,767
yes, it's me.
I'm back.

936
02:07:17,407 --> 02:07:20,407
Daddy, are you OK?

937
02:07:26,567 --> 02:07:28,966
Yes, darling.

938
02:07:28,967 --> 02:07:30,806
Does it hurt?

939
02:07:30,807 --> 02:07:33,006
No.

940
02:07:33,007 --> 02:07:36,007
I can't sleep. Light...

941
02:07:59,127 --> 02:08:02,127
The ring looks funny on your hand.

942
02:08:04,367 --> 02:08:07,367
Can I look at it?

943
02:08:11,767 --> 02:08:14,767
-Is it real?
-Yes.

944
02:08:17,487 --> 02:08:20,487
It was from my daddy to my mummy.

945
02:08:21,327 --> 02:08:24,327
And why have you got it?

946
02:08:25,967 --> 02:08:28,566
To...

947
02:08:28,567 --> 02:08:31,326
...your grandfather gave it
to your grandmother...

948
02:08:31,327 --> 02:08:34,327
...before he left Spain.

949
02:08:35,287 --> 02:08:38,287
She was pregnant and expecting me...

950
02:08:38,607 --> 02:08:41,166
...and she never saw him again.

951
02:08:41,167 --> 02:08:44,167
It's lovely. I never thought
I'd touch a real diamond.

952
02:08:47,327 --> 02:08:50,327
-Can I try it on?
-Yes.

953
02:09:00,247 --> 02:09:03,247
-It's yours now darling.
-Really?

954
02:09:04,367 --> 02:09:07,367
Mummy always wore it
