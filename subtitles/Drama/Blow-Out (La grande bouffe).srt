1
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:49,276
Travel is useful,
it exercises the imagination.

2
00:00:49,306 --> 00:00:51,156
All the rest
is disappointment and fatigue.

3
00:00:51,186 --> 00:00:53,606
Our journey is entirely imaginary.
That is its strength.

4
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:54,826
It goes from life to death.

5
00:00:54,856 --> 00:00:57,016
People, animals, cities, things,
all are imagined.

6
00:00:57,046 --> 00:00:58,852
It's a novel,
just a fictitious narrative.

7
00:00:58,882 --> 00:01:02,052
Littre says so, and he's never wrong.
And besides, anyone can do as much.

8
00:01:02,082 --> 00:01:04,902
You just have to close your eyes.
It's on the other side of life.

9
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:07,201
Louis-Ferdinand Celine
Journey to the End of the Night

10
00:01:11,611 --> 00:01:13,044
Fire!

11
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:36,763
You're a real pain in the ass!

12
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:38,924
Enough!

13
00:04:39,051 --> 00:04:41,884
They even have cocktails
with cherries. Remember?

14
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:44,366
Hey, jerks!

15
00:04:44,691 --> 00:04:46,044
I'll screw you!

16
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:48,480
I'll screw you!

17
00:05:06,211 --> 00:05:08,008
Have you seen Ermanno?

18
00:06:01,771 --> 00:06:05,081
- I'll screw you! Now!
- Get lost!

19
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:42,280
What the hell are you doing?

20
00:07:15,011 --> 00:07:16,763
My phone's been stolen!

21
00:08:00,811 --> 00:08:02,881
I'm starring in two TV dramas...

22
00:08:03,091 --> 00:08:05,047
I'm playing a Pope in one,

23
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:08,283
and a junkie on the road to recovery
in the other.

24
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:12,120
Impressive!
No theatre work?

25
00:08:12,251 --> 00:08:15,323
I'm supposed to do
Shakespeare with Pietro, but...

26
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:17,487
it has to be at least
three hours long,

27
00:08:17,651 --> 00:08:22,281
be an ambitious project,
and no more small cities!

28
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:26,445
I'm trying to write a piece
for theatre, and the concept is...

29
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:30,530
- What about you?
- I might give up acting.

30
00:08:30,691 --> 00:08:33,922
In this shitty country there are
never any good female roles.

31
00:08:34,091 --> 00:08:37,049
I'll write my first novel,
a Proust-style piece.

32
00:08:37,171 --> 00:08:39,844
Really?
Proust is my favorite writer!

33
00:08:39,971 --> 00:08:42,087
Along with Ammaniti...

34
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:44,490
What a coincidence.

35
00:08:52,171 --> 00:08:53,604
Who is that woman?

36
00:08:53,771 --> 00:08:55,807
Don't you recognize her?
It's Lorena.

37
00:08:56,131 --> 00:08:57,325
Who?

38
00:08:57,451 --> 00:09:01,524
An ex TV showgirl, now in
full physical and mental decline.

39
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:05,690
Never seen her! But then
I've never had a television.

40
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:10,282
Viola, I know you don't have one.
You tell me all the time.

41
00:09:10,451 --> 00:09:13,090
- What does she do now?
- Nothing, of course.

42
00:09:15,051 --> 00:09:16,564
Happy birthday, Jep!

43
00:09:16,731 --> 00:09:18,881
Happy birthday, Rome!

44
00:10:02,891 --> 00:10:05,610
La Colita!

45
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:27,968
To this question, as kids,

46
00:11:28,091 --> 00:11:31,447
my friends always gave
the same answer...

47
00:11:31,931 --> 00:11:33,683
"pussy".

48
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:35,929
Whereas I answered...

49
00:11:36,531 --> 00:11:38,840
"the smell of old
people's houses".

50
00:11:39,571 --> 00:11:41,243
The question was:

51
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:45,922
"What do you like most, really,
in life?"

52
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:50,082
I was destined for sensibility.

53
00:11:50,731 --> 00:11:54,246
I was destined to become a writer.

54
00:11:54,691 --> 00:11:59,606
I was destined to become
Jep Gambardella.

55
00:12:09,211 --> 00:12:11,327
You paid no attention
to me tonight!

56
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:15,080
Romano, don't start moaning,
we're not an item.

57
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,245
- You liked that guy?
- I like everyone and no one.

58
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:21,249
But I wonder why you're always
with me when it's no one's turn.

59
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:25,046
- Will you take me to the airport?
- Sure. What time are you leaving?

60
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:28,328
- In three hours.
- Three hours?

61
00:12:29,931 --> 00:12:32,604
Then I should crash on your sofa...

62
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:36,963
Go home, I need to pack
and I don't want anyone around.

63
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:40,003
- But I live miles away.
- See you at 8:00.

64
00:12:47,171 --> 00:12:49,002
Goodnight.

65
00:13:02,131 --> 00:13:04,008
Guys?

66
00:13:20,571 --> 00:13:22,448
Guys?

67
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:40,044
Children!

68
00:14:07,731 --> 00:14:09,244
Run along!

69
00:15:07,051 --> 00:15:08,723
Catellani?

70
00:15:10,771 --> 00:15:12,250
The best, of course.

71
00:15:14,571 --> 00:15:17,927
Did Catellani the tailor
make your suit?

72
00:16:07,771 --> 00:16:10,649
There was no doubt
about Malagna's shady intentions.

73
00:16:10,771 --> 00:16:15,242
The girl should be rescued
at any cost, without loss of time.

74
00:16:15,971 --> 00:16:17,404
Sir, you drank!

75
00:16:17,531 --> 00:16:19,647
Just enough to forget
my birthday.

76
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,566
- You want infusion?
- Heavens, no!

77
00:16:25,091 --> 00:16:26,683
- I got you a present.
- How sweet!

78
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:29,530
This is a lucky charm
from my country.

79
00:16:32,011 --> 00:16:35,208
Good thing it's lucky,
because it's pretty ugly.

80
00:16:35,331 --> 00:16:38,050
Keep it on your bedside
and stop complaining!

81
00:16:38,251 --> 00:16:41,926
I will! And thanks.
Wake me up at 15:00, you rascal.

82
00:16:42,891 --> 00:16:44,802
You're funny when you call me that!

83
00:20:01,011 --> 00:20:03,206
I don't love you!

84
00:20:06,891 --> 00:20:08,609
Brilliant!

85
00:20:17,531 --> 00:20:19,125
Did you enjoy the performance?

86
00:20:21,651 --> 00:20:23,369
Parts of it.

87
00:20:23,491 --> 00:20:26,005
That violent head-butt
made me understand many things.

88
00:20:26,131 --> 00:20:28,087
- Let's start from the beginning.
- Or the end?

89
00:20:28,771 --> 00:20:30,966
You know, Talia Concept
loves to provoke.

90
00:20:31,131 --> 00:20:34,601
Don't bother, there are more
important things than provoking me.

91
00:20:34,771 --> 00:20:38,446
And this habit of speaking
in the third person is unbearable.

92
00:20:38,611 --> 00:20:39,964
What are you reading?

93
00:20:40,131 --> 00:20:43,487
I don't need to read, I live
on vibrations, extrasensory ones.

94
00:20:43,611 --> 00:20:49,561
Extra-sensoriality aside,
what do you mean by vibrations?

95
00:20:49,731 --> 00:20:52,086
The poetry of vibrations cannot
be described

96
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:54,850
with the vulgarity of words.

97
00:20:55,531 --> 00:20:57,647
Well, try at least.

98
00:20:57,811 --> 00:20:59,767
I'm an artist,
I don't need to explain jack shit.

99
00:20:59,971 --> 00:21:04,487
So I'll write: "Lives on vibrations,
but she doesn't know what they are."

100
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:06,767
I'm starting to dislike
this interview,

101
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,802
I sense conflictuality in you.

102
00:21:08,971 --> 00:21:12,247
- Conflictuality as a vibration?
- As a pain in the ass.

103
00:21:12,411 --> 00:21:15,084
Let's talk about my mom's
abusive boyfriend.

104
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:18,761
No! I want to know
what a vibration is.

105
00:21:21,931 --> 00:21:24,240
It's my radar to intercept
the world.

106
00:21:24,411 --> 00:21:26,402
Your radar... meaning?

107
00:21:27,451 --> 00:21:29,442
You're a pain in the ass.

108
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:31,527
We got off to a bad start...

109
00:21:31,651 --> 00:21:34,404
Talia Concept wants to be
interviewed by your paper,

110
00:21:34,531 --> 00:21:37,364
it has many readers.
But you're biased.

111
00:21:37,491 --> 00:21:41,200
Write about how she has sex
with her fiance 11 times a day,

112
00:21:41,331 --> 00:21:43,128
he's a talented conceptual artist,

113
00:21:43,251 --> 00:21:46,288
he covers basketballs with confetti!
He's sensational!

114
00:21:46,411 --> 00:21:49,608
Talia Concept is talking about
things that are meaningless to me.

115
00:21:49,731 --> 00:21:52,086
All I've heard
is unpublishable fluff.

116
00:21:52,251 --> 00:21:54,606
You can't charm me
with things like:

117
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:57,484
"I'm an artist,
I don't need to explain".

118
00:21:57,611 --> 00:22:00,079
Our paper has a core
of cultured readers

119
00:22:00,251 --> 00:22:02,719
that don't want to be taken
for fools. I work for that core.

120
00:22:02,851 --> 00:22:05,411
So let me talk about my eventful,

121
00:22:05,571 --> 00:22:08,244
difficult but necessary
journey as an artist!

122
00:22:08,371 --> 00:22:10,009
Necessary for who?

123
00:22:10,131 --> 00:22:13,282
For heaven's sake, madam,
what is a vibration?

124
00:22:15,211 --> 00:22:18,009
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

125
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,526
You are an obsessive jerk!

126
00:22:20,651 --> 00:22:24,360
I'll tell your editor to send me
a journalist of a higher stature.

127
00:22:24,491 --> 00:22:27,608
A piece of advice:
When you speak to my editor,

128
00:22:27,771 --> 00:22:31,400
go easy on the stature business.
She's a dwarf, you know.

129
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:35,770
Jep, this interview is a hoot!

130
00:22:35,931 --> 00:22:37,967
Maybe, but don't send me

131
00:22:38,091 --> 00:22:40,143
to interview someone
who head-butts walls again.

132
00:22:40,971 --> 00:22:43,883
- You know what the trick is?
- Foam rubber.

133
00:22:44,051 --> 00:22:45,609
Amateur dramatics isn't dead.

134
00:22:45,771 --> 00:22:49,844
Did you get offended
about the stature comment?

135
00:22:50,011 --> 00:22:53,481
Don't be silly!
That's the funniest bit!

136
00:22:53,651 --> 00:22:55,801
I'm a dwarf, it's no secret.

137
00:22:55,971 --> 00:22:58,849
It's the first and last thing
everyone says about me.

138
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:02,367
You're a spectacular woman, Dadina.
You've had the career you deserve.

139
00:23:02,531 --> 00:23:05,887
But you haven't had the career
you deserve.

140
00:23:06,491 --> 00:23:08,482
Maybe I don't have much to say...

141
00:23:08,611 --> 00:23:12,206
Bullshit, you're lazy.
You never leave Rome.

142
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:14,931
Go to Giglio to do that report
on the Concordia

143
00:23:15,051 --> 00:23:16,769
I've asked you to do 50 times.

144
00:23:21,171 --> 00:23:24,481
Re-heated rice is always tastier
than freshly cooked rice.

145
00:23:24,651 --> 00:23:26,960
The old is better than the new.

146
00:23:27,771 --> 00:23:29,523
Plans tonight, cherie?

147
00:23:29,691 --> 00:23:33,240
As the great De Blasi,
my predecessor, said:

148
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:37,086
"Tonight I'll do two things,
eat soup and have a shag."

149
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:39,560
Two things that contradict
each other.

150
00:23:39,731 --> 00:23:42,689
That's what I'd say too,
and she'd reply, in a serious tone:

151
00:23:42,851 --> 00:23:46,969
"No, Dadina, they don't,
because they're both hot."

152
00:23:49,251 --> 00:23:52,482
There's a publishing house
in Ancona, it's not that small,

153
00:23:52,691 --> 00:23:54,647
they want an interview book
about you.

154
00:23:54,771 --> 00:23:58,650
Another interview book?
We're obsessed with interviews!

155
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:01,888
Can't you hear them?
"As I always say"...to who?

156
00:24:02,051 --> 00:24:03,450
Forget it!

157
00:24:03,571 --> 00:24:06,165
And honestly,
who'll buy a book called:

158
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:09,363
"Visions and revisions.
Jep Gambardella's Galaxy"?

159
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,283
It's a serious title!

160
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:14,170
Unfortunately in this country,
in order to be taken seriously,

161
00:24:14,331 --> 00:24:16,401
you have to take yourself seriously.

162
00:24:16,571 --> 00:24:20,883
I only wrote one novel, 40 years ago.
Impossible to find too...

163
00:24:21,051 --> 00:24:23,884
Bullshit, "The Human Apparatus"
was a masterpiece!

164
00:24:24,051 --> 00:24:25,962
It even won the... what was it?

165
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,691
- The Bancarella Prize.
- Shit, the Bancarella Prize!

166
00:24:28,851 --> 00:24:32,161
You're very kind, but forget it...
it'd be too pompous.

167
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:35,681
I can't, you'll put me
in an awkward position.

168
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,963
I've agreed and I've even accepted
an advance...

169
00:24:39,091 --> 00:24:40,524
- How much?
- 1,500 Euros.

170
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:43,165
Give it back,
I'll give you 1,500 Euros.

171
00:24:43,331 --> 00:24:46,482
By the way,
I spoke to the theatre people.

172
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:49,683
They'll give you three nights
but you pay for the lights.

173
00:24:49,851 --> 00:24:51,603
Who cares about that!

174
00:24:51,771 --> 00:24:53,727
Jep, this is great news.

175
00:24:54,131 --> 00:24:56,804
It's really great news.
Thank you!

176
00:25:02,731 --> 00:25:06,360
Are you still up?
It's time to go to bed.

177
00:25:06,531 --> 00:25:08,522
That's Viola Bartoli,
Bartoli's widow.

178
00:25:08,651 --> 00:25:11,211
The guy who was killed,
the actual Bartoli.

179
00:25:11,411 --> 00:25:15,484
Viola has a 50 meter yacht
that belonged to Himmler, the Nazi.

180
00:25:15,771 --> 00:25:17,727
You know what I call Viola?

181
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,405
- No, what?
- "To-good-to-poo".

182
00:25:20,571 --> 00:25:24,041
- I don't understand.
- Because she's pernickety.

183
00:25:24,171 --> 00:25:26,480
Usually pernickety people don't poo.

184
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:29,688
When I introduced Trumeau
to my family, my father said:

185
00:25:29,811 --> 00:25:33,281
"Miss, before marrying my son,
have you ever seen him poo?"

186
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:35,766
- How gross!
- It's not as bad as you think.

187
00:25:35,931 --> 00:25:40,402
Actually, my wife and I are the only
couple in Italy who are in love.

188
00:25:40,531 --> 00:25:42,487
Orietta, watch out for Lello.

189
00:25:42,651 --> 00:25:44,209
Yes, I know.

190
00:25:44,331 --> 00:25:47,129
He's the world's greatest salesman,
he cons everyone.

191
00:25:47,251 --> 00:25:49,128
In no time he'll get you to spend
every penny

192
00:25:49,251 --> 00:25:50,366
on whatever he's selling.

193
00:25:50,531 --> 00:25:51,805
You always flatter me.

194
00:25:51,971 --> 00:25:55,600
Just because I express myself well
doesn't mean I'm always working!

195
00:25:55,731 --> 00:25:57,722
- What do you do?
- I sell toys.

196
00:25:57,891 --> 00:25:59,722
Not just in a shop,

197
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:03,247
he's a wholesaler on a global scale,
he even sells to the Chinese!

198
00:26:03,371 --> 00:26:04,599
What about him?

199
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:08,889
Don't you know him? Sebastiano Paf,
perhaps Italy's greatest poet.

200
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:14,364
He wrote: "Up with life,
down with reminiscence."

201
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:18,044
He's on the Dukan Diet,
so Dadina won't leave him.

202
00:26:18,371 --> 00:26:19,201
Is he with her?

203
00:26:19,331 --> 00:26:22,050
- He is, but she...
- Like at high school.

204
00:26:23,131 --> 00:26:24,928
Why doesn't he ever talk?

205
00:26:25,091 --> 00:26:27,047
Because he listens.

206
00:26:29,051 --> 00:26:32,168
- Stop sniffing up with your nose?
- Bugger off.

207
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:36,682
Jep's found a theatre for me.
Do you want the lead role?

208
00:26:36,851 --> 00:26:39,729
I'm no longer an actress,
I'm a writer now.

209
00:26:39,971 --> 00:26:41,723
Maybe...

210
00:26:42,531 --> 00:26:44,442
Maybe I'll direct a film.

211
00:26:44,611 --> 00:26:48,524
- Viola, darling!
- Help me, I'm worried about my son.

212
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:51,603
- What can I do?
- Why don't you talk to him?

213
00:26:51,731 --> 00:26:54,120
You always say you're good
with strangers...

214
00:26:54,251 --> 00:26:56,207
That's the problem, I'm too good.

215
00:26:56,371 --> 00:27:00,603
- Is he seeing a therapist?
- Yes, but he wants to stop going.

216
00:27:00,771 --> 00:27:05,208
Take him to a psychiatrist, they're
pragmatic: Ativan, Prozac and so on.

217
00:27:05,371 --> 00:27:07,123
That stuff makes him feel worse.

218
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:10,840
Relax, he's always been odd,
he is what he is.

219
00:27:10,971 --> 00:27:14,043
By the way, have you tried
this rascal's endive quiche?

220
00:27:14,211 --> 00:27:17,681
It's the first time she's made it
and it's better than my mom's,

221
00:27:17,851 --> 00:27:21,161
please, you must try some!

222
00:27:26,571 --> 00:27:28,368
You changed your hair color.

223
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:32,364
I feel Pirandelloesque lately...

224
00:27:33,891 --> 00:27:36,724
- Great jazz, no?
- Not really.

225
00:27:36,851 --> 00:27:41,322
The Ethiopian jazz scene is the only
interesting one today.

226
00:27:41,491 --> 00:27:44,688
I'm from Milan, to be honest...
I find Romans...

227
00:27:45,211 --> 00:27:46,360
unbearable!

228
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:49,170
The best people in Rome
are the tourists.

229
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:50,690
Take Italy...

230
00:27:50,851 --> 00:27:54,127
What are we famous for overseas?
Fashion and pizza.

231
00:27:54,291 --> 00:27:56,680
A country of weavers and grocers.

232
00:27:56,851 --> 00:28:00,730
How can someone who sells toys,
bringing joy to the world,

233
00:28:00,851 --> 00:28:03,968
be such a pessimist
and a defeatist? You're dark.

234
00:28:04,131 --> 00:28:05,689
- Dark?
- Yes.

235
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,570
I heard Gisella Montanelli
went to loan sharks

236
00:28:08,731 --> 00:28:10,403
to pay her hairdressing debts.

237
00:28:10,571 --> 00:28:12,163
Jep says I'm dark!

238
00:28:12,331 --> 00:28:13,844
Gisella's really sunk that low?

239
00:28:13,971 --> 00:28:18,999
Rome is the only city in the world
where Marxism has truly existed.

240
00:28:19,171 --> 00:28:22,049
You can't excel over others
for more than a week,

241
00:28:22,211 --> 00:28:25,328
you're immediately brought back
to mediocrity.

242
00:28:25,451 --> 00:28:28,568
Rome is pure collectivism.

243
00:28:28,731 --> 00:28:31,962
Pure collectivism.
Stefania, what utter nonsense!

244
00:28:32,131 --> 00:28:35,407
Do you know that Flaubert wanted
to write a book about nothing?

245
00:28:35,571 --> 00:28:38,802
If he'd met you, we'd have had
a great book, what a shame!

246
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:41,569
You're a misogynist.

247
00:28:41,731 --> 00:28:45,644
It's not all about you, I'm not
a misogynist, I'm a misanthropist.

248
00:28:45,811 --> 00:28:47,927
When hate's involved,
one must aim high.

249
00:28:48,091 --> 00:28:50,924
You're a dark man.

250
00:28:51,091 --> 00:28:53,366
I'm a transparent person,
without a doubt!

251
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:42,209
Lello!

252
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:44,209
Aren't you stopping tonight?

253
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:59,605
Mom!
When I see you I blush!

254
00:30:00,691 --> 00:30:02,283
Andrea...

255
00:30:03,451 --> 00:30:06,045
- You're crazy.
- No, mom, I'm not crazy!

256
00:30:07,411 --> 00:30:09,129
I've got problems.

257
00:30:10,491 --> 00:30:13,563
"As the light flashed,
love sat down in the corner.

258
00:30:13,731 --> 00:30:16,450
Shy and distracted as it was.

259
00:30:16,611 --> 00:30:19,569
This is why
we could tolerate life no longer."

260
00:30:19,691 --> 00:30:22,444
Gosh,
no one's quoted me for years!

261
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:25,369
I read your book as a teenager,
I've never forgotten the end.

262
00:30:25,531 --> 00:30:29,604
Stop right there, you're stroking
my ego in a dangerous way.

263
00:30:29,731 --> 00:30:34,361
You must've been deeply in love
when you wrote it.

264
00:30:37,011 --> 00:30:39,730
Moravia made the same comment,
more or less.

265
00:30:39,851 --> 00:30:43,127
Even though he worded it
a bit better.

266
00:30:44,571 --> 00:30:47,244
I once saw Piazza Navona
covered in snow.

267
00:30:47,451 --> 00:30:49,726
Really? What was it like?

268
00:30:50,531 --> 00:30:52,249
White!

269
00:30:54,531 --> 00:30:56,601
When I come to Rome I live there.

270
00:30:57,171 --> 00:30:59,082
Deep in the outskirts...

271
00:31:00,771 --> 00:31:02,443
What job you do?

272
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:04,727
Me? I'm rich.

273
00:31:04,851 --> 00:31:06,807
Great job.

274
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:34,603
You didn't enjoy it.

275
00:31:34,891 --> 00:31:37,086
I know I'm not very good.

276
00:31:37,251 --> 00:31:39,003
Why do you say that?

277
00:31:39,491 --> 00:31:44,440
Plus it's so sad being good,
you risk becoming deft.

278
00:31:45,451 --> 00:31:47,567
It didn't seem like you cared much.

279
00:31:49,851 --> 00:31:53,161
You're very beautiful, Orietta,
very, very, very beautiful.

280
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:56,044
I take photos, you know.
Of myself.

281
00:31:56,171 --> 00:31:59,083
At all times of the day,
to get to know myself.

282
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:02,766
- With the self-timer, with my phone...
- Interesting.

283
00:32:02,931 --> 00:32:06,162
My Facebook friends say
I take great photos.

284
00:32:06,331 --> 00:32:08,799
I bet there are some of you naked...

285
00:32:10,331 --> 00:32:12,720
- A few.
- I knew it!

286
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:15,325
Do you want to see them?

287
00:32:15,451 --> 00:32:18,249
- Of course.
- I'll get my computer.

288
00:32:30,451 --> 00:32:36,367
The most important thing I discovered
a few days after turning 65

289
00:32:37,131 --> 00:32:41,249
is that I can't waste any more time
doing things I don't want to do.

290
00:33:09,171 --> 00:33:13,642
When I came to Rome,
at the age of 26,

291
00:33:13,771 --> 00:33:19,767
I fell pretty swiftly,
almost without realizing it,

292
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:24,761
into what might be defined
as the whirlpool of the high life.

293
00:33:25,411 --> 00:33:30,929
But I didn't just want to live
the high life.

294
00:33:31,451 --> 00:33:33,203
Sacconi should be in charge.

295
00:33:33,371 --> 00:33:36,124
Antonini's a fucking pain
in the ass!

296
00:33:38,931 --> 00:33:42,810
I wanted to be
the king of the high life.

297
00:33:43,171 --> 00:33:45,480
And I succeeded.

298
00:33:50,171 --> 00:33:54,528
I didn't just want
to go to parties.

299
00:33:56,611 --> 00:34:00,684
I wanted to have
the power to make them a failure.

300
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:29,925
Gambardella?

301
00:34:31,171 --> 00:34:34,641
Sorry for showing up like this,
without warning...

302
00:34:35,211 --> 00:34:37,122
I'm Alfredo Marti.

303
00:34:37,331 --> 00:34:40,368
Nice to meet you, I'm Jep,
but my house is this one.

304
00:34:40,571 --> 00:34:42,527
I don't want to bother you.

305
00:34:44,011 --> 00:34:45,729
How can I help you?

306
00:34:46,331 --> 00:34:48,447
I'm Elisa De Santis' husband.

307
00:34:54,611 --> 00:34:56,522
Did you have children?

308
00:34:56,691 --> 00:34:58,283
No.

309
00:34:58,771 --> 00:35:00,841
I couldn't.

310
00:35:01,851 --> 00:35:03,569
But I could.

311
00:35:05,851 --> 00:35:07,250
I could.

312
00:35:09,131 --> 00:35:10,644
I'm sorry.

313
00:35:11,451 --> 00:35:13,043
Forgive me.

314
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:16,445
She could too.

315
00:35:17,571 --> 00:35:19,527
Elisa died.

316
00:35:20,851 --> 00:35:22,489
Yesterday.

317
00:35:49,891 --> 00:35:52,928
Alfredo, if you need anything,
you know where I live.

318
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:03,683
Don't leave me alone, please.
Don't leave me.

319
00:36:14,251 --> 00:36:16,970
We were married for 35 years...

320
00:36:17,131 --> 00:36:19,691
but Elisa always loved you.

321
00:36:24,611 --> 00:36:26,602
What are you saying?

322
00:36:27,331 --> 00:36:30,243
Elisa and I went out together
when we were kids.

323
00:36:31,331 --> 00:36:34,687
She left me, I think,
it was so long ago I don't remember.

324
00:36:34,851 --> 00:36:38,924
Yes, she left you.
On September 8th, 1970.

325
00:36:39,091 --> 00:36:40,570
Exactly...

326
00:36:42,691 --> 00:36:45,524
You're distraught now,
that's normal.

327
00:36:45,691 --> 00:36:47,602
I'm not distraught.

328
00:36:47,731 --> 00:36:51,929
Elisa only ever loved one man.

329
00:36:52,051 --> 00:36:54,849
- You.
- How can you say that?

330
00:36:55,011 --> 00:36:57,844
I never saw Elisa again,
you were together for a lifetime!

331
00:36:58,011 --> 00:37:01,287
I found a diary of hers,
with a lock.

332
00:37:04,051 --> 00:37:05,404
And I broke the lock off.

333
00:37:08,291 --> 00:37:11,044
I write for a living, believe me...

334
00:37:12,091 --> 00:37:16,369
when you write, you give life
to fantasies, imagination, lies...

335
00:37:16,531 --> 00:37:19,887
I was only a good companion.

336
00:37:21,011 --> 00:37:24,003
That's all she wrote about me.

337
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:28,681
35 years together...

338
00:37:28,811 --> 00:37:33,123
and I'm mentioned in two lines
as a good companion.

339
00:37:38,971 --> 00:37:40,563
Here, Alfredo.

340
00:37:48,571 --> 00:37:50,641
What'll you do now?

341
00:37:52,011 --> 00:37:53,239
What I've always done.

342
00:37:55,291 --> 00:37:57,566
I'll live in adoration of her.

343
00:38:33,451 --> 00:38:35,123
What's he doing?

344
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:36,804
Stop!

345
00:38:38,131 --> 00:38:39,610
Jep!

346
00:39:03,011 --> 00:39:04,490
Well done!

347
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,603
He made it!

348
00:39:24,051 --> 00:39:27,407
- Have you seen my daughter?
- Your daughter? No.

349
00:39:32,331 --> 00:39:33,969
Francesca!

350
00:39:54,371 --> 00:39:55,724
Who are you?

351
00:39:57,771 --> 00:39:59,443
Who am I?

352
00:40:00,771 --> 00:40:03,683
- I am...
- No, you're nobody.

353
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:07,923
Nobody?

354
00:40:08,811 --> 00:40:10,324
But I...

355
00:40:34,931 --> 00:40:36,523
Francesca, where on earth are you?

356
00:40:36,691 --> 00:40:38,682
I've been looking for you
for over an hour!

357
00:40:47,371 --> 00:40:50,044
- Are you sad, sir?
- No.

358
00:40:50,411 --> 00:40:52,686
Sir is strange.

359
00:40:52,891 --> 00:40:55,689
I don't like that,
I prefer you to be sad.

360
00:40:56,011 --> 00:41:00,084
- Are you going to bed?
- Last night I went to bed at 22:30.

361
00:41:00,571 --> 00:41:02,721
Now I don't know what to do.

362
00:41:02,851 --> 00:41:05,809
Morning is an unknown object to me.

363
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:06,886
Unknown.

364
00:41:07,011 --> 00:41:10,287
Sir can help me clean
the house then.

365
00:41:10,691 --> 00:41:14,479
- Sir can't, sir feels strange.
- Sir is a rascal.

366
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:18,161
"Is there a new nation struggling
within the walls of the city?

367
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:22,605
From the crevices of that soil
a feverish vapor ascends like smoke

368
00:41:22,811 --> 00:41:26,804
and works like a magic potion
in the blood of some men

369
00:41:27,131 --> 00:41:32,649
producing a form of heroic madness
unlike any other."

370
00:41:36,051 --> 00:41:39,088
What do you think? Shit,
it's powerful, don't you think?

371
00:41:39,691 --> 00:41:42,922
Why the hell do an adaptation
of D'Annunzio for the stage?

372
00:41:43,131 --> 00:41:45,850
D'Annunzio has always been
paradigmatic...

373
00:41:45,971 --> 00:41:50,249
You think that certain
intellectual feats give you dignity,

374
00:41:50,411 --> 00:41:53,209
and that others are better than you,
but you're wrong!

375
00:41:53,491 --> 00:41:57,325
Try and write something of your own,
like...

376
00:41:58,011 --> 00:41:59,967
a feeling, or sorrow...

377
00:42:00,091 --> 00:42:02,685
I've known you ages
but you've never been here.

378
00:42:02,891 --> 00:42:06,042
Don't get big-headed, you've got
a room in a student flat...

379
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:09,408
Are you going out with that
gloomy girl you're always with?

380
00:42:09,571 --> 00:42:11,960
I wish!
I've tried it on 7,000 times.

381
00:42:12,091 --> 00:42:14,366
I've never even had a kiss,
not one!

382
00:42:14,531 --> 00:42:17,125
- She's a bitch.
- No, she's not.

383
00:42:19,051 --> 00:42:20,541
- She's complicated.
- She's a bitch.

384
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:22,402
Trust me, you're too kind.

385
00:42:22,531 --> 00:42:26,410
I can tell her type from a mile off,
I don't even need to meet them.

386
00:42:26,611 --> 00:42:29,683
- What are you doing with that hat?
- My morning exercise.

387
00:42:29,811 --> 00:42:32,041
- That's exercise?
- Yes!

388
00:42:32,611 --> 00:42:34,886
Do you know how many women
you've been with?

389
00:42:35,131 --> 00:42:36,928
No, I'm no good at math.

390
00:42:37,131 --> 00:42:39,201
I've always been good at math.

391
00:42:39,331 --> 00:42:42,880
It's six, I introduced you to them.

392
00:42:43,731 --> 00:42:45,562
Seven.

393
00:42:45,731 --> 00:42:47,289
- Seven?
- Seven.

394
00:42:47,771 --> 00:42:50,490
- When did number seven happen?
- Last summer.

395
00:42:50,611 --> 00:42:53,762
A friend of my sister's back home
when I went to see my folks.

396
00:42:54,331 --> 00:42:55,810
She runs a shop...

397
00:42:57,971 --> 00:43:00,565
- She's nice.
- That means she's a dog.

398
00:43:00,851 --> 00:43:03,285
What about you and Orietta?

399
00:43:03,531 --> 00:43:05,647
- Who's Orietta?
- Don't you know?

400
00:43:05,731 --> 00:43:08,882
She was at your house...
A real beauty.

401
00:43:09,011 --> 00:43:12,686
At my age, a beauty isn't enough.

402
00:43:25,851 --> 00:43:27,603
I might take up writing again.

403
00:43:28,651 --> 00:43:31,119
That's great news!

404
00:43:31,971 --> 00:43:33,370
Has something happened?

405
00:43:38,051 --> 00:43:39,404
Why?

406
00:43:39,571 --> 00:43:44,281
You want to write again after all
these years, something's happened.

407
00:43:46,651 --> 00:43:49,563
Something always happens in Rome.
Nothing's happened.

408
00:43:54,731 --> 00:43:56,562
What are you looking at?

409
00:43:57,691 --> 00:43:59,886
Come here.

410
00:44:06,851 --> 00:44:10,480
They met at university
10 days ago.

411
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:15,043
They haven't stopped kissing
for 10 days.

412
00:44:24,051 --> 00:44:26,519
This generation of youths
horrifies me.

413
00:44:26,851 --> 00:44:30,764
Supported by this state for years,
when they realize they're smart,

414
00:44:30,891 --> 00:44:32,802
they go study or work in America
or London,

415
00:44:32,931 --> 00:44:34,410
forgetting about the support.

416
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:36,527
They have no civil vocation.

417
00:44:36,691 --> 00:44:38,701
As a young girl,
in the occupied arts department,

418
00:44:38,731 --> 00:44:40,050
I oozed civil vocation.

419
00:44:40,251 --> 00:44:42,845
- Is that so?
- Yes, why?

420
00:44:43,051 --> 00:44:45,121
- Come off it...
- What do you know?

421
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:48,681
In those years you were in Naples
being a loafer with posh girls

422
00:44:48,851 --> 00:44:50,728
and writing your only novelette.

423
00:44:50,931 --> 00:44:52,683
I didn't notice that history
was being made.

424
00:44:52,851 --> 00:44:57,527
Novelette? It was a masterpiece
of Italian literature!

425
00:44:57,691 --> 00:45:00,603
I confirm that Jep and civil
vocation never got along,

426
00:45:00,811 --> 00:45:02,847
he was lazy and the other
hyperactive.

427
00:45:02,971 --> 00:45:06,566
Romano, stop sucking up to your
idol, you're pathetic!

428
00:45:07,011 --> 00:45:10,083
"The Human Apparatus"
was a narrow-minded, frivolous book

429
00:45:10,251 --> 00:45:13,209
and pretentious too, like its title.
Jep knows that.

430
00:45:13,331 --> 00:45:17,290
- That's why he stopped there.
- Sorry, what about you then?

431
00:45:17,411 --> 00:45:19,402
I tried changing things
with literature.

432
00:45:19,531 --> 00:45:23,604
I wrote 11 novels, and a book about
the Party's official history.

433
00:45:23,851 --> 00:45:26,923
You're forgetting your contribution
to that reality show...

434
00:45:27,051 --> 00:45:29,440
"Girl Farm".

435
00:45:29,571 --> 00:45:32,324
Television can be
a very formative experience!

436
00:45:32,491 --> 00:45:34,402
I always go when I'm invited.

437
00:45:34,611 --> 00:45:37,125
I get my hands dirty,
I try things...

438
00:45:37,251 --> 00:45:39,287
I don't spend my life being a snob.

439
00:45:39,411 --> 00:45:43,848
Are you saying that a socially
committed writer is advantaged,

440
00:45:44,091 --> 00:45:46,810
and safeguarded,
compared to a novelist

441
00:45:46,971 --> 00:45:49,360
who deals with, how can I say...
with feelings?

442
00:45:49,491 --> 00:45:51,163
Of course she is!

443
00:45:51,371 --> 00:45:54,283
The cause someone commits
their life to isn't secondary.

444
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:56,442
Like creating a family,

445
00:45:56,571 --> 00:45:58,402
dedicating oneself with sacrifice

446
00:45:58,531 --> 00:46:01,204
to raising one's children
day after day.

447
00:46:01,411 --> 00:46:05,120
Eusebio and I have four children,
we plan the future together.

448
00:46:05,251 --> 00:46:07,719
I work hard
to be both a mother and a woman,

449
00:46:07,971 --> 00:46:12,249
but at the end of the day
I feel I've done something important.

450
00:46:12,451 --> 00:46:13,661
So, if we don't have children

451
00:46:13,731 --> 00:46:17,087
we should contemplate
the idea of suicide?

452
00:46:17,251 --> 00:46:20,004
- I don't mean you, of course.
- She means me.

453
00:46:20,691 --> 00:46:24,206
Dadina, I admire you greatly.
You're a badass.

454
00:46:24,331 --> 00:46:27,004
Do you use "badass"
in any of your 11 novels?

455
00:46:27,131 --> 00:46:30,362
Yes, I do, I try to be modern.

456
00:46:30,531 --> 00:46:32,567
- Modernity is badass.
- De gustibus.

457
00:46:32,731 --> 00:46:37,680
What great conviction!
Should I envy you or be repelled?

458
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:41,290
Yes, I have convictions.
I'm 53...

459
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,930
- You'd never know.
- Never.

460
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,254
I'm 53, I've suffered,
I bounced back,

461
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,491
and learned so much about life.

462
00:46:50,351 --> 00:46:52,911
Well, I can see you have nothing
to say, at last.

463
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,408
I was drinking...

464
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:58,330
As we care about you,
we don't want to embarrass you.

465
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,613
You know, all this boastful talk,

466
00:47:00,691 --> 00:47:05,350
all this serious ostentatiousness,
all this ego...

467
00:47:05,891 --> 00:47:07,882
These harsh damning judgments
of yours

468
00:47:08,051 --> 00:47:10,440
hide a certain fragility,
a feeling of inadequacy

469
00:47:10,611 --> 00:47:14,923
and above all a series of untruths.
We care about you, we know you.

470
00:47:15,051 --> 00:47:18,930
We also know our untruths
and for this, unlike you,

471
00:47:19,051 --> 00:47:21,884
we end up talking about nonsense,
about trivial matters,

472
00:47:22,051 --> 00:47:25,043
because we don't want
to revel in our pettiness.

473
00:47:25,171 --> 00:47:27,207
What untruths
are you talking about?

474
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:30,005
Everything I said is true,
it's what I am, what I believe in.

475
00:47:30,171 --> 00:47:34,130
Please, I'm a gentleman.
Don't destroy my only certainty.

476
00:47:34,211 --> 00:47:39,239
Tell me exactly what my lies are
and what my fragility is!

477
00:47:39,491 --> 00:47:42,244
I'm a woman with balls, tell me!

478
00:47:43,531 --> 00:47:47,046
"Woman with balls" would be too much
for any gentleman.

479
00:47:47,171 --> 00:47:50,481
All right, Stefania,
you asked for it. In random order:

480
00:47:51,171 --> 00:47:54,561
Your civil vocation during
your student days went unnoticed.

481
00:47:54,691 --> 00:47:58,570
But another vocation of yours
is remembered by many,

482
00:47:58,771 --> 00:48:02,480
the one practiced by you then,
in the university toilets.

483
00:48:03,211 --> 00:48:07,250
You wrote about the Party because
you were its leader's mistress.

484
00:48:07,371 --> 00:48:09,327
And your 11 novels,

485
00:48:09,451 --> 00:48:12,887
published by a small publishing
house subsidized by the Party,

486
00:48:13,011 --> 00:48:16,208
reviewed by minor Party-affiliated
newspapers,

487
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:19,245
are insignificant,
everyone says so.

488
00:48:19,371 --> 00:48:22,522
I'm not saying my novelette
was any better,

489
00:48:22,651 --> 00:48:24,960
I agree with you there.

490
00:48:25,131 --> 00:48:27,770
Your relationship with Eusebio...

491
00:48:28,491 --> 00:48:31,528
What relationship?
Eusebio loves Giordano, everyone knows.

492
00:48:33,451 --> 00:48:34,520
He has for years.

493
00:48:34,891 --> 00:48:37,769
They lunch every day
at Arnaldo's, under the coat rack,

494
00:48:37,891 --> 00:48:41,600
like sweethearts under an oak tree.
You all know but turn a blind eye.

495
00:48:42,091 --> 00:48:46,482
Your dedication to your children,
with all the sacrifices entailed...

496
00:48:46,811 --> 00:48:49,245
You work all week in TV,
you go out every night,

497
00:48:49,411 --> 00:48:53,609
even on Mondays, when popper
dealers don't even venture out.

498
00:48:53,731 --> 00:48:55,289
You're never with your children,

499
00:48:55,411 --> 00:48:58,005
not even on the
long holidays you take.

500
00:48:58,131 --> 00:49:01,840
And plus you have a butler,
a waiter,

501
00:49:03,011 --> 00:49:06,970
a cook, a chauffeur
who drives the kids to school,

502
00:49:07,131 --> 00:49:08,803
three babysitters, so...

503
00:49:08,931 --> 00:49:13,209
how and when exactly
do you make any sacrifices?

504
00:49:13,811 --> 00:49:16,769
These are the untruths and fragility
I'm talking about.

505
00:49:19,051 --> 00:49:21,690
Stefania, mother and woman.

506
00:49:21,891 --> 00:49:26,567
You're 53, with a life in tatters,
like the rest of us.

507
00:49:27,611 --> 00:49:31,365
Instead of acting superior
and treating us with contempt,

508
00:49:31,531 --> 00:49:34,523
you should look at us
with affection.

509
00:49:35,291 --> 00:49:37,168
We're all on the brink of despair,

510
00:49:37,291 --> 00:49:39,851
all we can do
is look each other in the face,

511
00:49:40,011 --> 00:49:43,890
keep each other company,
joke a little...

512
00:49:44,011 --> 00:49:45,160
Don't you agree?

513
00:52:24,691 --> 00:52:26,727
Son of a bitch!

514
00:52:27,691 --> 00:52:29,090
Egidio, old chap!

515
00:52:29,331 --> 00:52:32,482
Bastard!
I haven't seen you in 30 years!

516
00:52:44,571 --> 00:52:47,563
- I need to talk to you.
- Later! I'm busy, can't you see?

517
00:52:47,691 --> 00:52:50,649
- Is this still your place?
- Luckily not, I sold it.

518
00:52:50,811 --> 00:52:52,324
I'm still the manager though.

519
00:52:52,451 --> 00:52:56,569
You're famous! You're always
in the gossip rags.

520
00:52:56,771 --> 00:52:59,285
You're at all the VIP parties,
always with a girl!

521
00:52:59,451 --> 00:53:01,248
You never come here...

522
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:04,767
Get lost, will you?
We're having a serious talk!

523
00:53:04,971 --> 00:53:07,280
- Are you married?
- Married, divorced.

524
00:53:07,411 --> 00:53:11,040
- I've got a daughter, Ramona.
- Did you have to call her Ramona?

525
00:53:11,171 --> 00:53:13,321
You artists are all the same!

526
00:53:13,531 --> 00:53:16,443
I tell you I have a daughter
and you complain about her name!

527
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:18,442
What's wrong with "Ramona"?

528
00:53:18,651 --> 00:53:21,370
Nothing, it's a name that implies
ambitions...

529
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:23,487
There's my daughter, you see?

530
00:53:35,371 --> 00:53:38,090
She makes me so mad,
I've told her a million times!

531
00:53:38,251 --> 00:53:40,128
You're too old for this!

532
00:53:40,251 --> 00:53:43,607
Now these hot young Polish girls
rule the scene.

533
00:53:43,851 --> 00:53:46,206
They're experts at turning tricks.

534
00:53:46,331 --> 00:53:49,368
She's 42 and she wants to be
a sophisticated stripper.

535
00:53:49,531 --> 00:53:51,999
But the world's no longer
sophisticated. Right, Jep?

536
00:53:52,171 --> 00:53:54,605
I know, only you and I are.

537
00:53:54,771 --> 00:53:56,409
That's right, God damnit!

538
00:53:56,611 --> 00:54:00,081
But she wants to keep doing
this job, for the money.

539
00:54:00,371 --> 00:54:01,929
I don't know why
she always needs money

540
00:54:02,051 --> 00:54:03,404
and what she fucking
does with it.

541
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:07,285
- For drugs?
- I wish, we'd have a common interest.

542
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:09,083
She doesn't even drink beer.

543
00:54:09,331 --> 00:54:12,243
I don't know what she spends
her money on, she's always broke.

544
00:54:12,451 --> 00:54:14,965
- Do I seem like a loser?
- No, why?

545
00:54:15,131 --> 00:54:19,170
Because I can hear myself talk,
I sound like a loser.

546
00:54:19,291 --> 00:54:22,966
I'm nearly 70 and I have to work
'til 6 in the morning every day.

547
00:54:23,091 --> 00:54:26,481
I swapped cocaine for heroin
15 years ago.

548
00:54:26,611 --> 00:54:30,286
What an asshole!
A heroin junkie at 50!

549
00:54:30,531 --> 00:54:32,123
Could I be more of a loser?

550
00:54:32,251 --> 00:54:36,802
But I'm not important,
it's her I worry about, I love her.

551
00:54:37,011 --> 00:54:39,479
And I'm no loser there,
I'm a father.

552
00:54:39,611 --> 00:54:41,647
And like all fathers, I'm worried.

553
00:54:41,771 --> 00:54:43,523
What'll she do in a few years?

554
00:54:43,691 --> 00:54:45,727
She can't be a stripper at 50!

555
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,487
- Why don't you fix her up?
- Me?

556
00:54:50,611 --> 00:54:55,048
Don't you know any rich guys
who want a beautiful wife?

557
00:54:55,251 --> 00:54:57,811
We could change her name,
that's no problem.

558
00:54:57,931 --> 00:54:59,603
You'd do me a big favor.

559
00:54:59,851 --> 00:55:04,481
- I'm a writer, not a pimp.
- Sorry, I was a bit vulgar.

560
00:55:04,611 --> 00:55:08,320
Daddy's little girl, this is
my good friend, Jep Gambardella.

561
00:55:08,491 --> 00:55:11,369
I'll leave you to it,
I need the toilet.

562
00:55:11,531 --> 00:55:13,010
Be right back!

563
00:55:14,211 --> 00:55:16,441
- Hi, I'm Jep.
- Ramona.

564
00:55:30,091 --> 00:55:34,403
- If you want a girl, get a Pole.
- Are you kidding?

565
00:55:35,171 --> 00:55:38,368
Who wants a girl?
Not me.

566
00:55:38,491 --> 00:55:40,959
I really am an old friend
of your father's.

567
00:55:41,491 --> 00:55:43,322
- Dad has no friends.
- He used to.

568
00:55:43,491 --> 00:55:46,801
When I came to Rome, I'd wait for
my friends to leave to come here.

569
00:55:47,131 --> 00:55:48,723
Your father was a nice guy.

570
00:55:48,891 --> 00:55:51,963
He taught me loads of things,
such as: Vodka is uncouth.

571
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,324
How useful!

572
00:55:56,411 --> 00:55:58,129
He asked me to find you a husband.

573
00:55:58,251 --> 00:56:01,766
He's obsessed.
I'm not looking for a husband.

574
00:56:02,011 --> 00:56:04,047
Well, you should be.

575
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:07,330
- A family's a beautiful thing.
- I know.

576
00:56:07,451 --> 00:56:09,840
But I'm not cut out
for beautiful things.

577
00:56:24,891 --> 00:56:26,847
What's wrong?

578
00:56:27,771 --> 00:56:30,968
- I feel old.
- You're no spring chicken.

579
00:58:14,451 --> 00:58:15,850
One.

580
00:58:19,651 --> 00:58:21,642
- How are you?
- Very well.

581
00:58:21,911 --> 00:58:24,944
Just got back from India,
I had amazing dysentery.

582
00:58:25,351 --> 00:58:28,668
Come to my divorce party,
I'll have burlesque dancers there.

583
00:58:28,731 --> 00:58:31,489
Of course.
What present would you like?

584
00:58:31,561 --> 00:58:34,833
One big wish: For the wars
in the Middle East to end.

585
00:58:35,041 --> 00:58:36,554
- I'll do my best.
- Two.

586
00:58:36,641 --> 00:58:37,994
700 Euros.

587
00:58:38,371 --> 00:58:39,690
Thank you.

588
00:58:40,011 --> 00:58:41,160
Tell me, darling.

589
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:46,267
Perhaps...
I was thinking, my mouth...

590
00:58:46,691 --> 00:58:49,746
I'm scared, I've never
done it before, professor.

591
00:58:49,811 --> 00:58:53,962
Don't call me professor.
Call me "my friend" or "my love".

592
00:58:54,191 --> 00:58:55,988
We all need love.

593
00:58:56,691 --> 00:58:59,649
What star sign are you,
deeply intense lady?

594
00:58:59,971 --> 00:59:01,689
- Aquarius.
- I knew it!

595
00:59:02,111 --> 00:59:05,547
Want to go back 30 years, to when
it rained at the end of August?

596
00:59:06,311 --> 00:59:08,461
- Done.
- That's 700 Euros.

597
00:59:08,791 --> 00:59:09,867
Three.

598
00:59:14,571 --> 00:59:18,801
- You've been to see Casagrande!
- No, I don't even know him.

599
00:59:18,881 --> 00:59:20,036
You betrayed me, darling!

600
00:59:20,591 --> 00:59:24,425
We're undergoing a journey,
and you've interrupted it.

601
00:59:25,531 --> 00:59:27,647
This is the last time.

602
00:59:31,691 --> 00:59:32,924
Go, go.

603
00:59:33,091 --> 00:59:35,049
Well, then...
Goodbye.

604
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:37,046
- Full price.
- Five.

605
00:59:37,211 --> 00:59:38,485
1,200 Euros.

606
00:59:39,491 --> 00:59:41,524
- How's your mom?
- She's fine, thank you.

607
00:59:42,091 --> 00:59:44,047
- Seven.
- 700 Euros.

608
00:59:44,171 --> 00:59:45,445
Have you filled out, darling?

609
00:59:45,611 --> 00:59:47,090
You're always in my heart.

610
00:59:47,211 --> 00:59:48,439
700 Euros.

611
00:59:48,611 --> 00:59:51,171
- As handsome as ever.
- Ten.

612
00:59:51,371 --> 00:59:53,043
- You're my pride.
- Thanks.

613
00:59:54,211 --> 00:59:55,769
Eleven.

614
01:00:00,291 --> 01:00:03,966
Professor, I'm here about
my hyperhidrosis.

615
01:00:04,171 --> 01:00:06,366
Where does this undesired
perspiration happen?

616
01:00:06,851 --> 01:00:08,682
On my hands.

617
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:15,802
- Pray for me, sister.
- You don't need my prayers.

618
01:00:15,931 --> 01:00:20,880
You don't know how much of my income
I must surrender to the tax man.

619
01:00:21,051 --> 01:00:22,848
Go, sister, go.

620
01:00:31,651 --> 01:00:32,970
That's 700, sister.

621
01:00:34,531 --> 01:00:36,647
Fourteen.

622
01:00:54,291 --> 01:00:56,964
- Spying on me?
- No, I was going to knock.

623
01:00:57,291 --> 01:00:59,486
- When?
- When you were more relaxed.

624
01:01:13,011 --> 01:01:16,640
- What brings you here?
- Nothing, I'm just curious.

625
01:01:17,891 --> 01:01:21,281
- I told you what I think.
- I've no hidden agenda.

626
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:25,882
Do you think every guy
who comes near you wants sex?

627
01:01:26,051 --> 01:01:28,281
Perhaps they just want to talk,

628
01:01:28,451 --> 01:01:31,727
driven by simple
and harmless curiosity.

629
01:01:31,851 --> 01:01:34,046
- That's never happened to me.
- It has now.

630
01:01:36,131 --> 01:01:38,008
Wouldn't armbands be more
comfortable?

631
01:01:38,131 --> 01:01:40,850
Yes, but they irritate my armpits.

632
01:01:42,891 --> 01:01:44,882
Any plans for lunch?

633
01:01:45,011 --> 01:01:46,967
I'm going to my mum's with my dad.

634
01:01:47,091 --> 01:01:49,207
So where's the dog?

635
01:01:49,971 --> 01:01:51,484
What dog?

636
01:01:51,611 --> 01:01:54,648
People buy houses like this
so they can have dogs.

637
01:01:54,771 --> 01:01:59,287
I had a Labrador, but 9 years ago
he got fed up and left me.

638
01:02:00,051 --> 01:02:01,882
Labradors are dumb.

639
01:02:02,291 --> 01:02:04,805
And Cocker Spaniels are dumb too.

640
01:02:12,131 --> 01:02:13,644
Hi, Jep.

641
01:02:14,331 --> 01:02:16,003
Hi, Antonello.

642
01:02:17,251 --> 01:02:20,129
- You know Venditti?
- I know everyone.

643
01:02:20,891 --> 01:02:23,849
It must be very satisfying
knowing so many people!

644
01:02:23,971 --> 01:02:27,566
- You're guaranteed to be unhappy.
- Have people let you down?

645
01:02:29,211 --> 01:02:31,520
I've let them down.

646
01:02:32,771 --> 01:02:34,204
Andrea! Are you with your mom?

647
01:02:34,331 --> 01:02:36,083
- She's parking.
- How are you?

648
01:02:36,211 --> 01:02:37,803
Not well.

649
01:02:37,931 --> 01:02:40,923
Proust says that death
may come to us this afternoon.

650
01:02:41,051 --> 01:02:42,450
Proust is scary.

651
01:02:42,571 --> 01:02:45,608
Not tomorrow, not in a year,
but this afternoon.

652
01:02:45,731 --> 01:02:48,609
But it's evening already
so it'd be tomorrow afternoon.

653
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:52,485
Turgenev said: "Death looked at me,
noticing me."

654
01:02:52,691 --> 01:02:55,159
Don't take these writers
so seriously!

655
01:02:55,291 --> 01:02:57,361
Who should I take seriously then?

656
01:02:57,491 --> 01:03:00,801
Nothing, apart from the menu,
of course.

657
01:03:03,251 --> 01:03:07,324
Things are too complicated to be
understood by one individual.

658
01:03:08,051 --> 01:03:11,566
Just because you don't understand
doesn't mean nobody can.

659
01:03:15,011 --> 01:03:17,730
- Your reply?
- My reply?

660
01:03:18,531 --> 01:03:20,806
- Jep!
- Hello, Viola.

661
01:03:21,491 --> 01:03:23,925
- Good evening.
- Viola.

662
01:03:24,051 --> 01:03:27,202
Darling, why don't you
get a table for us?

663
01:03:30,331 --> 01:03:31,730
How did you find him?

664
01:03:33,171 --> 01:03:35,082
- He's better.
- Good, very good.

665
01:03:35,331 --> 01:03:37,720
He's much better, I'm so happy!

666
01:03:37,851 --> 01:03:40,081
- Dinner on Thursday?
- Of course!

667
01:03:40,211 --> 01:03:41,690
On Thursday I'm inexplicably free.

668
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:47,125
Did you hear about Valentina Lemme?
She's dating her personal trainer.

669
01:03:47,251 --> 01:03:49,321
Really? It doesn't show.

670
01:03:49,931 --> 01:03:52,650
- I invited her anyway.
- Are you sure?

671
01:03:52,771 --> 01:03:56,286
She's nasty, you know.
She's like the devil!

672
01:03:56,571 --> 01:03:58,289
Really? You think so?

673
01:03:58,411 --> 01:04:01,721
I see her at yoga twice a week.

674
01:04:01,851 --> 01:04:03,728
- You'll come?
- Of course.

675
01:04:03,851 --> 01:04:06,319
- See you Thursday.
- Okay.

676
01:04:06,851 --> 01:04:08,364
Goodbye.

677
01:04:10,891 --> 01:04:15,646
Watch that table carefully, but
don't let them notice you looking.

678
01:04:17,651 --> 01:04:20,961
Waiter? Champagne, please.
Cristal.

679
01:04:21,091 --> 01:04:23,730
You can't imagine
how much one learns

680
01:04:23,971 --> 01:04:27,441
by living alongside
a cluster of religious institutes.

681
01:04:41,491 --> 01:04:44,085
So that was your first time?

682
01:04:44,211 --> 01:04:49,046
Yes, he didn't think he'd been good,
too quick, he said.

683
01:04:49,171 --> 01:04:52,322
So, out of anger or to let off
steam, I'm not sure which,

684
01:04:52,451 --> 01:04:56,000
he got a football
and played with it furiously!

685
01:04:56,251 --> 01:04:57,730
And you?

686
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:00,769
I didn't enjoy making love with him,

687
01:05:00,851 --> 01:05:05,402
but seeing him with a football
was an unforgettable thing!

688
01:05:06,371 --> 01:05:10,364
He became really good,
he played on the national team.

689
01:05:14,211 --> 01:05:16,771
Your dad said you spend everything
you earn.

690
01:05:16,851 --> 01:05:18,682
What on? You can tell me.

691
01:05:20,611 --> 01:05:24,365
Maybe one day. But why didn't you
write another book?

692
01:05:24,491 --> 01:05:26,686
Because I went out too much
at night.

693
01:05:29,531 --> 01:05:31,328
Rome makes you waste a lot of time.

694
01:05:31,611 --> 01:05:36,366
It's distracting.
Writing requires focus and peace.

695
01:05:36,811 --> 01:05:38,961
That's not much of an answer.

696
01:05:39,211 --> 01:05:42,442
You have plenty of peace here,
it's like being in the country.

697
01:05:42,611 --> 01:05:47,639
I wrote in short spurts.
I was a sprint-style writer.

698
01:05:52,171 --> 01:05:54,765
I told you about my first time...

699
01:05:54,971 --> 01:05:57,883
but you've told me nothing.
It's your turn now.

700
01:06:06,651 --> 01:06:09,882
On an island... one summer.

701
01:06:10,011 --> 01:06:11,649
I was...

702
01:06:12,691 --> 01:06:14,010
18, she was 20.

703
01:06:16,051 --> 01:06:17,769
At the lighthouse, at night.

704
01:06:20,531 --> 01:06:23,568
I went to kiss her,
she turned away.

705
01:06:25,091 --> 01:06:26,968
I was disappointed.

706
01:06:29,171 --> 01:06:31,810
But then she turned to look at me.

707
01:06:32,491 --> 01:06:34,607
She brushed me with her lips...

708
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:36,765
she smelled of flowers.

709
01:06:38,571 --> 01:06:42,564
I didn't move,
I wasn't able to move.

710
01:06:46,291 --> 01:06:50,284
Then she took a step back...
and said...

711
01:06:57,131 --> 01:06:58,325
She took a step back.

712
01:07:03,051 --> 01:07:04,803
And said...

713
01:07:19,731 --> 01:07:21,881
I'm going home, it's late.

714
01:07:22,051 --> 01:07:24,929
Want to come to a party
tomorrow night?

715
01:08:11,651 --> 01:08:12,766
Outstanding!

716
01:08:14,491 --> 01:08:16,880
Did you want us to die tonight?

717
01:08:17,171 --> 01:08:20,322
You won't believe it,
but I love knife throwers.

718
01:08:20,451 --> 01:08:23,090
A true likeness,
especially the hips.

719
01:08:23,491 --> 01:08:27,564
A masterpiece, Geronimo.
It'll look great on the mantelpiece.

720
01:09:23,891 --> 01:09:25,882
God bless you, Jep!

721
01:09:26,251 --> 01:09:27,650
This is Ramona.

722
01:09:27,771 --> 01:09:29,568
What a unique and marvelous
creature.

723
01:09:30,131 --> 01:09:32,440
- Is he taking the piss?
- It's hard to know.

724
01:09:32,611 --> 01:09:34,169
I was being honest.

725
01:09:34,331 --> 01:09:36,481
I'm just sorry you missed
Geronimo D.

726
01:09:36,851 --> 01:09:40,730
- What a tragedy!
- Come in, make yourselves at home.

727
01:09:41,491 --> 01:09:43,561
- Who is that asshole?
- Lillo De Gregorio.

728
01:09:43,691 --> 01:09:46,842
The greatest modern art collector
in this debauched country.

729
01:09:47,131 --> 01:09:51,409
- What's Jep's floozy friend wearing?
- I don't know.

730
01:09:51,571 --> 01:09:54,722
Jep's proving to be
a disappointment.

731
01:09:54,891 --> 01:09:57,928
- Good evening, countess.
- Hello, you're looking well.

732
01:09:58,131 --> 01:10:02,329
I wish I could say that same
about the count. Hello, ladies!

733
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:05,609
Are you stupid?
You're distracting my artist.

734
01:10:05,731 --> 01:10:07,130
Dad, we're having fun.

735
01:10:07,331 --> 01:10:09,765
Carmelina, come and do some work.

736
01:10:09,891 --> 01:10:11,688
Mom, I want to play here.

737
01:10:11,811 --> 01:10:14,883
- Has this human being gone mad?
- We'll sort it out.

738
01:10:15,051 --> 01:10:18,248
- I'm not coming, I'm staying here.
- You don't mean that.

739
01:10:18,371 --> 01:10:20,566
Europe's greatest gallery owners
are outside.

740
01:10:20,691 --> 01:10:24,479
If you show them what you can do
then ours will be a happy family.

741
01:10:24,611 --> 01:10:27,364
But I'm already happy,
I want to be a vet one day.

742
01:10:27,531 --> 01:10:32,400
Get to bed, you two!
My kids are going to bed.

743
01:10:32,571 --> 01:10:33,481
Come.

744
01:10:33,611 --> 01:10:36,045
I'll go to bed too.
I'm a kid too.

745
01:10:41,051 --> 01:10:43,326
She blushes and says:

746
01:10:43,531 --> 01:10:47,683
"Forgive me, I didn't know
you loved me so much.

747
01:10:48,091 --> 01:10:51,049
My ignorance is obscene."

748
01:10:51,531 --> 01:10:53,761
He looks at her, reassuringly,
and says:

749
01:10:53,971 --> 01:10:57,168
"Let me defend our love".

750
01:10:57,331 --> 01:11:00,050
How's that for the start
of the second act?

751
01:11:00,171 --> 01:11:02,162
You've written a pile of shit.

752
01:13:52,811 --> 01:13:54,722
That girl was crying.

753
01:13:54,811 --> 01:13:57,484
Nonsense!
That girl earns millions!

754
01:13:58,611 --> 01:14:00,442
Excuse me a moment.

755
01:14:03,371 --> 01:14:06,249
- Hi, Stefano.
- Hi.

756
01:14:06,891 --> 01:14:10,566
- The catering's gone downhill.
- Rome's gone downhill.

757
01:14:10,651 --> 01:14:12,050
Steeply downhill!

758
01:14:15,531 --> 01:14:17,681
Do you have the case with you?

759
01:14:20,411 --> 01:14:22,925
- I always do.
- You up for it?

760
01:15:27,211 --> 01:15:28,246
See that?

761
01:15:33,371 --> 01:15:37,603
Stefano has the keys to Rome's
most beautiful buildings.

762
01:15:39,211 --> 01:15:40,724
Is he a doorman?

763
01:15:42,491 --> 01:15:44,766
No, he's not a doorman.

764
01:15:45,091 --> 01:15:47,525
He's friends with princesses.

765
01:15:50,571 --> 01:15:51,924
Are you ready?

766
01:15:52,891 --> 01:15:54,290
Come with me.

767
01:17:54,131 --> 01:17:56,326
Good evening, Princesses.

768
01:17:56,451 --> 01:17:58,601
Good evening.

769
01:18:11,331 --> 01:18:13,083
How come you have all these keys?

770
01:18:15,011 --> 01:18:16,649
Because...

771
01:18:18,171 --> 01:18:20,002
I'm a trustworthy person.

772
01:18:34,971 --> 01:18:39,169
Did you see? It looked huge,
but it's tiny.

773
01:18:40,851 --> 01:18:44,048
Stay still, I'll take a photo of you.
Don't move.

774
01:18:47,611 --> 01:18:49,886
That's no good.
Laugh.

775
01:18:52,211 --> 01:18:53,690
Got it?

776
01:18:54,091 --> 01:18:56,241
Yes, that's good.

777
01:19:47,571 --> 01:19:50,529
Many think that a funeral,

778
01:19:50,651 --> 01:19:53,802
is a fortuitous event,
without any rules.

779
01:19:54,491 --> 01:19:55,970
That's not true.

780
01:19:56,491 --> 01:20:00,166
A funeral is a high-society event
par excellence.

781
01:20:01,651 --> 01:20:04,927
You must never forget
that at a funeral

782
01:20:05,771 --> 01:20:07,887
you are appearing on stage.

783
01:20:12,131 --> 01:20:13,610
Nice.

784
01:20:14,531 --> 01:20:16,169
Nice, but try the other one.

785
01:20:18,051 --> 01:20:22,920
You must patiently wait
for the relatives to disperse.

786
01:20:23,411 --> 01:20:28,280
Once you are sure
that all the guests are seated...

787
01:20:28,491 --> 01:20:32,120
only at that point, may you offer
your condolences to the family.

788
01:20:32,651 --> 01:20:36,564
In this way, everyone will see you.

789
01:20:36,811 --> 01:20:39,200
You take the mourner's hands,

790
01:20:39,371 --> 01:20:43,000
and rest yours on their arms.

791
01:20:43,411 --> 01:20:47,040
You whisper something to them,
a comforting phrase,

792
01:20:47,251 --> 01:20:49,242
said with authority.

793
01:20:49,371 --> 01:20:51,726
For example:

794
01:20:51,851 --> 01:20:56,447
"In the days to come,
when you feel the void,

795
01:20:57,131 --> 01:21:01,568
I want you to know
that you can always count on me."

796
01:21:03,051 --> 01:21:04,928
The public will ask...

797
01:21:06,571 --> 01:21:09,449
"What's Jep Gambardella saying?"

798
01:21:22,131 --> 01:21:24,122
This is definitely the right dress.

799
01:21:29,211 --> 01:21:33,648
You're allowed to retire
to a corner by yourself,

800
01:21:34,131 --> 01:21:37,328
as if contemplating your sorrow.

801
01:21:38,731 --> 01:21:43,202
However, another matter
must be approached with shrewdness.

802
01:21:43,891 --> 01:21:48,282
The chosen place needs
to be isolated

803
01:21:48,411 --> 01:21:50,447
but clearly visible
to the public.

804
01:21:51,171 --> 01:21:57,280
Besides, a performance is good when
it is devoid of any superfluity.

805
01:21:59,651 --> 01:22:01,403
So, the fundamental rule:

806
01:22:03,011 --> 01:22:05,400
One must never cry at a funeral.

807
01:22:06,531 --> 01:22:09,523
You must never steal the show
from the family's sorrow.

808
01:22:09,651 --> 01:22:12,723
That is forbidden.

809
01:22:15,651 --> 01:22:17,403
Because it is immoral.

810
01:22:54,011 --> 01:22:55,683
Viola.

811
01:23:04,011 --> 01:23:08,527
In the days to come,
when you feel the void,

812
01:23:09,771 --> 01:23:12,046
you can always count on me.

813
01:24:00,171 --> 01:24:05,689
Now I ask Andrea's friends
to come forward,

814
01:24:07,571 --> 01:24:10,404
so that the coffin
may be carried outside.

815
01:24:31,931 --> 01:24:33,000
Your back!

816
01:25:41,891 --> 01:25:44,166
It was nice not making love.

817
01:25:45,931 --> 01:25:47,808
It was nice loving each other.

818
01:25:48,611 --> 01:25:52,240
I'd forgotten what loving someone
was about, I'd forgotten that.

819
01:25:58,971 --> 01:26:01,531
I spend all my money to cure myself.

820
01:26:10,291 --> 01:26:12,282
Your breakfast.

821
01:26:13,371 --> 01:26:16,408
Come on, I'm taking you to see
a sea monster today.

822
01:26:37,251 --> 01:26:38,764
Your breakfast.

823
01:26:40,931 --> 01:26:42,922
Five more minutes.

824
01:26:49,771 --> 01:26:51,807
Can you see the sea?

825
01:26:58,571 --> 01:27:00,289
Where?

826
01:27:00,451 --> 01:27:02,123
On the ceiling.

827
01:27:08,211 --> 01:27:10,247
Yes, I can see it.

828
01:28:40,891 --> 01:28:43,644
Who's going to look after you now?

829
01:28:58,011 --> 01:29:01,924
I'm sorry about your daughter.
My condolences.

830
01:29:27,291 --> 01:29:33,048
I spent all my summers
making plans for September.

831
01:29:33,171 --> 01:29:34,763
Not any longer.

832
01:29:36,211 --> 01:29:40,329
Now I spend the summer
remembering the good intentions

833
01:29:40,851 --> 01:29:42,762
which vanished.

834
01:29:43,331 --> 01:29:47,210
In part because of laziness,
in part because of carelessness.

835
01:29:50,411 --> 01:29:53,244
What's wrong
with feeling nostalgic?

836
01:29:54,771 --> 01:29:56,841
It's the only distraction left for those

837
01:29:56,971 --> 01:29:59,485
who've no faith in the future!

838
01:30:03,131 --> 01:30:04,928
Without rain...

839
01:30:05,371 --> 01:30:09,762
August is coming to an end
and September isn't arriving.

840
01:30:11,131 --> 01:30:13,440
And I'm so ordinary!

841
01:30:14,131 --> 01:30:16,440
But there's no need to worry.

842
01:30:16,851 --> 01:30:19,809
It's all right, it's okay.

843
01:30:27,331 --> 01:30:28,730
Bravo!

844
01:30:43,931 --> 01:30:45,284
Thank you.

845
01:31:30,891 --> 01:31:33,246
What are you doing here?

846
01:31:34,131 --> 01:31:37,521
Arturo!
Why are you here?

847
01:31:37,691 --> 01:31:41,001
Don't you see?
I'm rehearsing my magic show.

848
01:31:41,131 --> 01:31:45,090
This is tomorrow's special number:
The vanishing giraffe.

849
01:31:45,851 --> 01:31:47,569
You can make this giraffe vanish?

850
01:31:47,691 --> 01:31:50,649
Of course I can make
the giraffe vanish!

851
01:31:52,171 --> 01:31:54,560
Then make me vanish too.

852
01:31:56,011 --> 01:32:01,722
Jep, do you think that if I could
really make people vanish

853
01:32:02,131 --> 01:32:05,965
I'd still be here at my age
playing these circus games?

854
01:32:07,211 --> 01:32:08,769
It's just a trick.

855
01:32:13,091 --> 01:32:14,729
It's just a trick!

856
01:32:24,131 --> 01:32:26,087
Romano, how did it go?

857
01:32:26,331 --> 01:32:28,242
Well, they clapped.

858
01:32:28,571 --> 01:32:30,323
I'm glad.

859
01:32:30,651 --> 01:32:33,324
- So why are you so sad?
- I'm not sad.

860
01:32:33,611 --> 01:32:35,124
What's with the giraffe?

861
01:32:35,291 --> 01:32:38,044
For a magic show.
I'll come and see you tomorrow.

862
01:32:38,211 --> 01:32:40,042
I'm not doing the show tomorrow.

863
01:32:40,931 --> 01:32:42,603
Why not? You said it went well.

864
01:32:42,731 --> 01:32:47,486
I'm leaving, I'm going back
to my home town, for good.

865
01:32:47,731 --> 01:32:51,201
I won't even pack up my things,
I'll leave it all.

866
01:32:53,571 --> 01:32:56,847
I've lived in this city
for 40 years.

867
01:32:57,651 --> 01:32:59,846
And in the end I thought...

868
01:33:01,371 --> 01:33:04,044
the only person
who deserved a goodbye

869
01:33:04,451 --> 01:33:06,282
was you.

870
01:33:08,291 --> 01:33:10,361
So you're leaving?

871
01:33:12,611 --> 01:33:15,523
Romano... why are you leaving?

872
01:33:16,011 --> 01:33:18,445
Rome has really disappointed me.

873
01:33:24,051 --> 01:33:25,689
Bye, Jep.

874
01:33:44,931 --> 01:33:46,489
See?

875
01:34:14,891 --> 01:34:17,928
- Want some coffee?
- No, thanks. I know you're busy.

876
01:34:18,091 --> 01:34:19,763
I need to ask you something.

877
01:34:20,291 --> 01:34:21,770
Go ahead.

878
01:34:25,891 --> 01:34:28,166
Why did Elisa leave me?

879
01:34:31,251 --> 01:34:32,923
I don't know.

880
01:34:33,051 --> 01:34:36,930
Didn't she say anything about it
in her diary?

881
01:34:37,531 --> 01:34:39,601
No, I don't think so.

882
01:34:42,611 --> 01:34:46,320
Would you be offended
if I asked to read it?

883
01:34:46,491 --> 01:34:49,164
No, I wouldn't.

884
01:34:49,771 --> 01:34:52,046
In fact, I'd understand.

885
01:34:53,811 --> 01:34:56,086
But I'm afraid I can't
let you read it.

886
01:34:56,251 --> 01:34:57,240
Why not?

887
01:34:58,211 --> 01:35:00,930
Because a few days after the
funeral, I threw it away.

888
01:35:06,531 --> 01:35:08,601
May I introduce you
to my girlfriend?

889
01:35:10,091 --> 01:35:12,400
Hello, my name's Polina.

890
01:35:15,411 --> 01:35:18,050
Like Polina in "The Gambler"
by Dostoyevsky.

891
01:35:24,131 --> 01:35:25,962
What are you doing tonight?

892
01:35:27,691 --> 01:35:29,568
Nothing.

893
01:35:30,131 --> 01:35:32,008
Polina's going to finish ironing...

894
01:35:32,891 --> 01:35:35,121
then we'll drink a glass
of red wine.

895
01:35:35,851 --> 01:35:39,446
We'll watch some television
and go to bed.

896
01:35:40,611 --> 01:35:41,566
What about you?

897
01:35:43,211 --> 01:35:47,682
I'll have a lot of drinks, but not
so many as to become unruly.

898
01:35:48,491 --> 01:35:50,607
And then...

899
01:35:51,611 --> 01:35:56,002
when you'll be getting up
I'll be going to bed.

900
01:36:02,651 --> 01:36:05,802
What lovely people you are!

901
01:36:15,811 --> 01:36:17,881
I love doing the train!

902
01:36:22,251 --> 01:36:23,730
I'll screw you.

903
01:36:26,091 --> 01:36:28,082
"Who am I?"

904
01:36:29,731 --> 01:36:32,768
That's how
one of Breton's novels began.

905
01:36:33,651 --> 01:36:36,723
And of course in the book
there's no reply.

906
01:36:37,731 --> 01:36:40,040
- Did you hear about Viola?
- What?

907
01:36:40,251 --> 01:36:42,164
She's donating everything
to the church.

908
01:36:42,651 --> 01:36:47,122
She works in the parish
and is going to volunteer in Africa.

909
01:36:47,411 --> 01:36:52,087
The trains at our parties
are the best ones in Rome!

910
01:36:52,931 --> 01:36:54,922
- You think so?
- I do.

911
01:36:56,451 --> 01:36:59,966
They're the best because
they go nowhere.

912
01:37:10,731 --> 01:37:13,086
- Well?
- It's wonderful, thank you.

913
01:37:13,211 --> 01:37:15,771
Come on, it's all gone.

914
01:37:15,891 --> 01:37:19,327
Tell me why you left me, please.

915
01:37:19,451 --> 01:37:21,760
I want an explanation, please!

916
01:37:22,611 --> 01:37:25,648
Go away!
Get out! Get out!

917
01:37:50,491 --> 01:37:52,322
You see all these people?

918
01:37:53,371 --> 01:37:55,362
They can't do anything.

919
01:37:55,931 --> 01:37:58,570
But I know how to do something.

920
01:37:59,331 --> 01:38:02,004
We know how to do something.

921
01:38:03,291 --> 01:38:05,043
How sweet!

922
01:38:47,411 --> 01:38:51,643
They've been asking me for years
why I don't write another novel.

923
01:38:52,811 --> 01:38:54,802
But look at these people.

924
01:38:55,811 --> 01:38:57,927
This wildlife!

925
01:38:58,891 --> 01:39:01,963
This is my life
and it's nothing.

926
01:39:05,251 --> 01:39:07,970
Flaubert wanted to write a book
about nothing but he failed,

927
01:39:08,091 --> 01:39:10,241
so could I do it?

928
01:39:16,931 --> 01:39:19,570
It's nice.
Thanks, rascal.

929
01:39:33,011 --> 01:39:35,241
What inspired this exhibition?

930
01:39:36,211 --> 01:39:39,328
It wasn't my idea
to do this photo exhibition.

931
01:39:39,451 --> 01:39:41,601
It was my father's idea.

932
01:39:42,451 --> 01:39:45,682
When I was born, he starting taking
photos of me, every day.

933
01:39:45,891 --> 01:39:47,768
One photo per day.

934
01:39:48,331 --> 01:39:50,640
He never forgot, not even once.

935
01:39:51,371 --> 01:39:55,046
From the age of 14 upwards,
I continued.

936
01:39:55,731 --> 01:39:58,848
I photographed myself every day.

937
01:40:03,131 --> 01:40:04,723
Go ahead.

938
01:41:44,131 --> 01:41:46,804
- Cardinal!
- Your Eminence!

939
01:41:49,811 --> 01:41:52,279
Cardinal,
when will The Saint arrive in Rome?

940
01:41:52,411 --> 01:41:55,687
On Thursday,
but please don't call her The Saint.

941
01:41:55,811 --> 01:41:59,804
She is a Saint but not technically.

942
01:42:00,731 --> 01:42:03,529
Tell me something,
who is that cardinal?

943
01:42:03,651 --> 01:42:05,960
- That's Bellucci.
- Bellucci?

944
01:42:06,091 --> 01:42:07,843
- The one in line to be...
- Exactly.

945
01:42:07,971 --> 01:42:09,962
The papal throne awaits him.

946
01:42:10,171 --> 01:42:12,765
I met him at Giada Ricci's
carnival party.

947
01:42:12,891 --> 01:42:16,008
Rumor has it that he used to be
Europe's best exorcist.

948
01:42:16,131 --> 01:42:17,849
- Are you pulling my leg?
- No.

949
01:42:18,691 --> 01:42:20,443
I never joke about the devil.

950
01:42:20,971 --> 01:42:24,168
Do you know I'm very, very bored.

951
01:42:25,451 --> 01:42:28,170
We're having a great, great time.

952
01:42:28,851 --> 01:42:30,569
You cut up the duck.

953
01:42:30,691 --> 01:42:35,845
Cook it on a high flame
for 15 minutes.

954
01:42:35,971 --> 01:42:37,643
At that point...

955
01:42:37,811 --> 01:42:40,609
Cardinal, do you remember me?
Lello Cava.

956
01:42:40,731 --> 01:42:44,644
We met at Giada Ricci's party.
I was dressed as an escort.

957
01:42:45,091 --> 01:42:47,605
Come, they're starting
to serve lunch.

958
01:42:47,891 --> 01:42:51,327
I'd like you meet my writer friend,
Jep Gambardella.

959
01:42:52,011 --> 01:42:56,448
A writer!
This country needs writers.

960
01:42:56,571 --> 01:42:58,687
Actually I thought it was more
in need of priests.

961
01:42:58,851 --> 01:42:59,647
Help.

962
01:42:59,771 --> 01:43:02,922
- May I ask you a question?
- Of course, my dear man.

963
01:43:03,051 --> 01:43:05,963
Well, for some time now...

964
01:43:11,651 --> 01:43:14,449
from a spiritual point of view...

965
01:43:15,451 --> 01:43:19,763
- Skunk hunt?
- Of course, I'll lead the way!

966
01:43:19,891 --> 01:43:23,122
I know the Tebaldi grounds well.

967
01:43:28,891 --> 01:43:33,009
Jep Gambardella, the king
of socialites! You're losing it.

968
01:43:33,131 --> 01:43:38,330
I've been losing it for 40 years.
It's a steady decline.

969
01:43:42,411 --> 01:43:47,963
Tell me something, Stefania.
Have we ever slept with each other?

970
01:43:48,691 --> 01:43:51,000
Of course not!

971
01:43:55,411 --> 01:43:59,563
That's an awfully big mistake!
We must make amends, immediately.

972
01:44:00,531 --> 01:44:02,522
Idiot.

973
01:44:05,091 --> 01:44:06,922
Thank goodness.

974
01:44:08,171 --> 01:44:11,243
We still have something nice
to do together.

975
01:44:14,171 --> 01:44:17,243
The future is marvelous, Stefania.

976
01:44:51,371 --> 01:44:54,283
To be honest, Catellani
hasn't had many brushed fabrics

977
01:44:54,411 --> 01:44:56,561
in recent years.

978
01:44:56,691 --> 01:44:59,967
In my opinion, Rebecchi's still
the best tailor in Rome.

979
01:45:03,451 --> 01:45:06,329
- Who are you?
- A hard-working man.

980
01:45:06,451 --> 01:45:11,241
One who, while you play the artist
and have fun with your friends,

981
01:45:11,371 --> 01:45:13,646
keeps this country going.

982
01:45:13,771 --> 01:45:16,365
I keep this country going,

983
01:45:16,491 --> 01:45:19,164
but many people
haven't understood that yet.

984
01:45:21,851 --> 01:45:26,367
Imagine that, Dadina,
Giulio Moneta was my neighbor.

985
01:45:26,491 --> 01:45:31,849
One of the world's 10 most wanted
men and I never noticed.

986
01:45:31,971 --> 01:45:34,724
You've changed,
you're always thinking.

987
01:45:37,171 --> 01:45:39,446
Maybe I should do what Romano did.

988
01:45:40,331 --> 01:45:42,526
I'm not fit for this life
or this city.

989
01:45:42,651 --> 01:45:47,122
Nobody's fit for shit, damnit.
Take it from the queen of misfits.

990
01:45:48,451 --> 01:45:50,919
Everything around me is dying.

991
01:45:51,891 --> 01:45:55,008
People who are younger than me,
things...

992
01:45:55,851 --> 01:45:57,045
All before my eyes and I...

993
01:45:57,171 --> 01:46:00,607
And you're suffering.
And you don't understand.

994
01:46:08,331 --> 01:46:10,765
How's the soup, Little Jep?

995
01:46:13,331 --> 01:46:15,049
The soup's good.

996
01:46:17,251 --> 01:46:21,085
Why did you call me Little Jep? No
one's called me that for centuries.

997
01:46:21,211 --> 01:46:23,486
Because a friend,
every now and again,

998
01:46:23,651 --> 01:46:27,087
needs to make their friend
feel like they did as a child.

999
01:46:29,051 --> 01:46:31,565
How can I make you feel
like a little girl?

1000
01:46:31,691 --> 01:46:34,524
You don't need to, I feel
like a little girl every day!

1001
01:46:34,651 --> 01:46:38,200
I've seen the world from
their viewpoint for 60 years.

1002
01:46:39,491 --> 01:46:41,641
You know Sister Maria,
the missionary,

1003
01:46:42,291 --> 01:46:43,770
the one they call the Saint?

1004
01:46:43,891 --> 01:46:47,725
Yes, she's coming to Rome
to receive some honor.

1005
01:46:47,851 --> 01:46:51,127
Exactly. In all her life,
she's only given three interviews.

1006
01:46:51,251 --> 01:46:54,766
- Yours will be memorable.
- Yeah sure, think of Giulio Moneta!

1007
01:46:54,891 --> 01:46:58,679
This is different.
She studied in Italy

1008
01:46:58,811 --> 01:47:01,723
and speaks Italian.
She read your book and loved it.

1009
01:47:02,331 --> 01:47:03,650
She wants to meet you

1010
01:47:03,771 --> 01:47:05,966
so I organized a dinner party
at your house tomorrow.

1011
01:47:06,091 --> 01:47:09,561
- Did I do well?
- You did very well.

1012
01:49:07,571 --> 01:49:11,246
Tomorrow I'll have the honor
of dining with her.

1013
01:49:11,371 --> 01:49:13,805
- At the Holy Father's?
- No.

1014
01:49:13,971 --> 01:49:15,484
No, at Jep Gambardella's.

1015
01:49:16,251 --> 01:49:22,008
You see, the Pope even invited
the enclosed nuns.

1016
01:49:55,771 --> 01:49:58,285
Sisters, sisters, sisters!

1017
01:49:59,211 --> 01:50:01,042
Sisters, sisters...
Yes, perfect!

1018
01:50:03,451 --> 01:50:05,760
Ah, the Red Cross nurses!
Well-toned!

1019
01:50:05,931 --> 01:50:08,729
Okay, great...
What handsome young men!

1020
01:50:09,251 --> 01:50:10,525
Great!

1021
01:50:11,091 --> 01:50:12,490
Let's go!

1022
01:50:16,171 --> 01:50:18,127
The Saint's assistant called me.

1023
01:50:18,251 --> 01:50:22,005
The Saint would like Count and
Countess Odescalchi to come too,

1024
01:50:22,131 --> 01:50:24,601
as they treated her like a sister
when she lived in Italy.

1025
01:50:24,730 --> 01:50:27,680
- Do you know them?
- Of course, but they are not in Rome.

1026
01:50:27,710 --> 01:50:31,060
All the nobles are in London,
at Philip's great-niece's wedding.

1027
01:50:31,131 --> 01:50:34,123
Let's call the Colonnas of Reggio.

1028
01:50:34,251 --> 01:50:36,048
The nobles for hire?
They're dead.

1029
01:50:36,931 --> 01:50:38,649
Nonsense, they're immortal.

1030
01:50:38,771 --> 01:50:42,286
The Saint won't even notice,
70 years have gone by!

1031
01:50:43,011 --> 01:50:45,081
This piece of furniture
looks great...

1032
01:50:45,251 --> 01:50:49,847
- Who would've thought!
- It looks great, like a new bathroom!

1033
01:50:54,291 --> 01:50:56,361
Count Colonna speaking.

1034
01:50:56,971 --> 01:50:59,280
Yes, we are available.

1035
01:51:00,191 --> 01:51:01,749
For tonight.

1036
01:51:02,151 --> 01:51:05,766
Our rate is 250 Euros per person
for the evening.

1037
01:51:06,291 --> 01:51:09,408
Plus the cost of the car hire.

1038
01:51:10,491 --> 01:51:14,928
This would be somewhat
humiliating for us...

1039
01:51:15,551 --> 01:51:20,308
We are willing to be hired
as the Colonnas of Reggio.

1040
01:51:20,731 --> 01:51:24,804
But as for pretending to be
the Odescalchis...

1041
01:51:25,171 --> 01:51:26,365
I don't know...

1042
01:51:27,651 --> 01:51:30,324
We were at war for two centuries.

1043
01:51:31,041 --> 01:51:32,838
I feel it's immoral.

1044
01:51:33,031 --> 01:51:37,229
Cut at least twelve pieces
of rabbit!

1045
01:51:37,791 --> 01:51:41,227
Set aside the kidneys, liver,
head...

1046
01:51:41,531 --> 01:51:43,408
Gently brown.

1047
01:51:44,250 --> 01:51:47,050
Don't forget thyme,
laurel leaves, rosemary...

1048
01:51:47,080 --> 01:51:51,278
Then red wine, Ligurian olives...
pine nuts.

1049
01:51:52,051 --> 01:51:55,009
And after an hour,
you have Ligurian-style rabbit!

1050
01:51:55,691 --> 01:51:58,000
Sister Maria, what convent
are you staying at?

1051
01:51:58,131 --> 01:52:01,919
Actually, we're at the Hassler Hotel
at the Spanish Steps.

1052
01:52:02,891 --> 01:52:05,785
To be honest, Sister Maria
finds it uncomfortable.

1053
01:52:05,860 --> 01:52:08,328
Never heard the Hassler
described as uncomfortable!

1054
01:52:08,691 --> 01:52:10,124
It's very comfortable

1055
01:52:10,251 --> 01:52:13,402
but Sister Maria isn't used
to sleeping in a bed.

1056
01:52:13,971 --> 01:52:17,088
She sleeps on the floor,
in a cardboard bed.

1057
01:52:17,170 --> 01:52:19,161
Do you have any visits planned?

1058
01:52:19,331 --> 01:52:21,162
Sister Maria will climb

1059
01:52:21,240 --> 01:52:23,390
St John's Basilica's Scala Sancta
on her knees.

1060
01:52:23,731 --> 01:52:26,245
- Have you?
- I'd have liked to, but...

1061
01:52:26,371 --> 01:52:29,204
I have a bad knee...

1062
01:52:29,331 --> 01:52:31,799
Orthopedic problems
are unimportant,

1063
01:52:32,011 --> 01:52:36,607
compared to the partial indulgence
granted by the Scala Sancta.

1064
01:52:36,731 --> 01:52:41,247
That's true! Another specialty
of mine is lamb with...

1065
01:52:41,371 --> 01:52:44,329
Does Sister Maria still help
the sick?

1066
01:52:44,611 --> 01:52:47,569
22 hours a day, every day.

1067
01:52:47,731 --> 01:52:51,087
She washes them, feeds them...
You ought to see her.

1068
01:52:51,251 --> 01:52:53,719
Despite her age,
she doesn't walk, she runs.

1069
01:52:53,851 --> 01:52:59,847
Now she's tired, but that's because
she's not with her patients.

1070
01:53:00,011 --> 01:53:01,524
How old is she?

1071
01:53:01,651 --> 01:53:03,562
She'll be 104 in October.

1072
01:53:03,731 --> 01:53:05,881
- That's impressive.
- I thought she was older!

1073
01:53:06,051 --> 01:53:10,806
Longevity too, like all things,
is not accidental.

1074
01:53:10,971 --> 01:53:13,485
About Sister Maria's interview
with Jep...

1075
01:53:13,611 --> 01:53:18,560
Her interview?
There must be a mix-up...

1076
01:53:18,691 --> 01:53:21,489
Sister Maria hasn't given
any interviews since 1971,

1077
01:53:21,611 --> 01:53:24,250
after the reason
for her mission in Chad,

1078
01:53:24,371 --> 01:53:27,010
was misunderstood by some.

1079
01:53:27,491 --> 01:53:30,483
Of course, but considering
her admiration for Jep's work...

1080
01:53:30,651 --> 01:53:32,926
You told me she enjoyed
"The Human Apparatus".

1081
01:53:33,091 --> 01:53:36,208
She found it beautiful and fierce.

1082
01:53:36,331 --> 01:53:38,242
Like the world of men.

1083
01:53:38,371 --> 01:53:40,965
Great! There would be no risk
of any misunderstanding,

1084
01:53:41,131 --> 01:53:42,962
Sister Maria can review the text...

1085
01:53:43,171 --> 01:53:46,163
- No, I'm sorry.
- Don't insist.

1086
01:53:46,331 --> 01:53:49,607
I don't wish to raise
any false hopes,

1087
01:53:49,731 --> 01:53:53,167
there's absolutely
no question of any interview.

1088
01:53:53,291 --> 01:53:56,124
Sorry, but why do
you always answer?

1089
01:53:56,251 --> 01:53:58,287
Why not let Sister Maria talk?

1090
01:54:16,731 --> 01:54:19,040
Madam...

1091
01:54:21,731 --> 01:54:25,724
I took a vow of poverty.

1092
01:54:27,491 --> 01:54:31,803
And you can't talk about poverty...

1093
01:54:33,451 --> 01:54:35,123
you have to live it.

1094
01:54:46,011 --> 01:54:49,845
Such true and real words!
Powerful words!

1095
01:54:53,811 --> 01:54:55,802
Do you need anything, madam?

1096
01:54:56,451 --> 01:54:58,726
- She needs the bathroom.
- It's on the left.

1097
01:54:58,891 --> 01:55:01,564
The change of diet
isn't good for her.

1098
01:55:01,691 --> 01:55:07,880
Sister Maria, in Mali, only eats
40 grams of plant roots a day.

1099
01:55:08,171 --> 01:55:11,447
Me too sometimes, in the evening,
as a light meal,

1100
01:55:11,571 --> 01:55:15,007
I have some splendid
roots with lemon.

1101
01:55:15,131 --> 01:55:18,248
You clean the roots
by scraping them with a knife

1102
01:55:18,451 --> 01:55:21,761
and you cut them into small
chunks...

1103
01:55:21,971 --> 01:55:25,168
Cardinal, remember when we met
at that wedding?

1104
01:55:25,371 --> 01:55:27,043
You were there too...

1105
01:55:28,531 --> 01:55:33,559
I felt the need to ask you
about matters close to my heart.

1106
01:55:33,811 --> 01:55:36,279
Matters regarding faith...

1107
01:55:36,611 --> 01:55:40,286
regarding the strength
of spirituality...

1108
01:55:40,611 --> 01:55:42,602
But then you got distracted.

1109
01:55:42,771 --> 01:55:44,170
You can ask me now.

1110
01:55:46,051 --> 01:55:49,600
- No, I don't see the point.
- Why?

1111
01:55:49,731 --> 01:55:55,328
I'd be very disappointed to discover
that you have no answers.

1112
01:55:55,811 --> 01:55:58,405
I'm only saying
it's a possibility...

1113
01:55:58,531 --> 01:56:00,408
I think that...

1114
01:56:06,571 --> 01:56:07,686
Never mind...

1115
01:56:12,971 --> 01:56:14,609
I apologize for earlier.

1116
01:56:14,811 --> 01:56:18,326
There is one question
I really want to ask you.

1117
01:56:19,411 --> 01:56:21,971
Are the rumors about you true?

1118
01:56:23,011 --> 01:56:24,888
That you were a truly great...

1119
01:56:26,931 --> 01:56:28,603
exorcist?

1120
01:56:56,451 --> 01:56:58,282
Sister Maria...

1121
01:56:58,811 --> 01:57:00,290
Sister Maria!

1122
01:57:02,251 --> 01:57:03,809
- Sister Maria!
- Saint...

1123
01:57:03,931 --> 01:57:05,762
- Have you seen her?
- No, she's not there.

1124
01:57:08,131 --> 01:57:09,849
- Sister Maria!
- Saint...

1125
01:57:09,971 --> 01:57:11,199
Sister Maria!

1126
01:57:11,331 --> 01:57:12,366
Saint!

1127
01:57:12,491 --> 01:57:15,164
She's called Sister Maria.

1128
01:57:15,291 --> 01:57:16,929
Sister Maria...

1129
01:57:17,051 --> 01:57:19,849
Where has that bitch got to?

1130
01:57:43,891 --> 01:57:45,722
Sister Maria!

1131
01:57:48,531 --> 01:57:50,487
Sister Maria!

1132
01:57:52,931 --> 01:57:54,284
My goodness!

1133
01:57:55,651 --> 01:57:57,403
My goodness!

1134
01:58:28,451 --> 01:58:31,284
Come, Elisabetta, let's go to bed.

1135
01:58:31,451 --> 01:58:34,329
You go ahead, I'm going upstairs
for a moment.

1136
01:58:35,571 --> 01:58:37,641
Don't be late.

1137
01:59:49,211 --> 01:59:52,009
In this room, in 1930,

1138
01:59:52,131 --> 01:59:55,521
Princess Antonietta gave birth
to her only daughter,

1139
01:59:55,651 --> 01:59:57,846
Elisabetta Colonna of Reggio.

1140
01:59:58,211 --> 02:00:01,248
The princess died
after giving birth.

1141
02:00:01,371 --> 02:00:04,249
Young Elisabetta,
in these opulent rooms,

1142
02:00:04,371 --> 02:00:07,124
had a happy and carefree
childhood.

1143
02:00:07,251 --> 02:00:11,961
But shortly after, the financial
hardship endured by Prince Erminio,

1144
02:00:12,571 --> 02:00:15,324
forced him to sell the property.

1145
02:00:50,771 --> 02:00:52,807
They're migrating west...

1146
02:00:52,971 --> 02:00:56,884
but now they are resting.

1147
02:01:10,171 --> 02:01:11,809
Did you know

1148
02:01:12,731 --> 02:01:17,009
that I know the Christian names...

1149
02:01:17,611 --> 02:01:21,570
of all of these birds?

1150
02:01:28,971 --> 02:01:30,086
Why...

1151
02:01:31,851 --> 02:01:35,287
did you never write another book?

1152
02:01:41,451 --> 02:01:43,203
I was looking for the great beauty,

1153
02:01:45,291 --> 02:01:46,929
but...

1154
02:01:50,051 --> 02:01:51,245
I didn't find it.

1155
02:01:53,091 --> 02:01:54,809
Do you know...

1156
02:01:55,611 --> 02:01:57,124
why...

1157
02:01:57,811 --> 02:02:00,723
I only eat roots?

1158
02:02:06,051 --> 02:02:07,643
No, why?

1159
02:02:14,571 --> 02:02:18,962
Because roots are important.

1160
02:04:48,131 --> 02:04:51,885
Now there's something
I want to show you.

1161
02:05:50,731 --> 02:05:54,201
This is how it always ends.
With death.

1162
02:05:55,411 --> 02:05:58,642
But first there was life.

1163
02:05:59,131 --> 02:06:03,010
Hidden beneath the blah, blah, blah.

1164
02:06:05,371 --> 02:06:10,126
It is all settled beneath
the chitter chatter and the noise.

1165
02:06:10,931 --> 02:06:14,287
Silence and sentiment.

1166
02:06:14,771 --> 02:06:17,763
Emotion and fear.

1167
02:06:18,971 --> 02:06:24,284
The haggard, inconstant
flashes of beauty.

1168
02:06:25,011 --> 02:06:30,085
And then the wretched squalor
and miserable humanity.

1169
02:06:31,211 --> 02:06:35,602
All buried under the cover of the
embarrassment of being in the world.

1170
02:06:40,811 --> 02:06:44,326
Beyond there,
is what lies beyond.

1171
02:06:45,331 --> 02:06:48,721
I don't deal
with what lies beyond.

1172
02:06:49,811 --> 02:06:54,601
Therefore...
let this novel begin.

1173
02:06:55,451 --> 02:06:59,285
After all...
it's just a trick.

1174
02:07:00,251 --> 02:07:03,926
Yes, it's just a trick.
