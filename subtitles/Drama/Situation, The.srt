Movie and Subtitle available at 
www.phimworld.com.

2
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,230
Plan B

3
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,630
Be careful, the plan may fail.

4
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,150
Get someone to bring them
back soon.

5
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,660
Lets go up and grab them.

6
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,270
Good-bye Mr. Chen.

7
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,110
What happen?

8
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,630
Mr. Luo, I saw your office lights is on,
guess you are still busy.

9
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,230
I came back to collect something
and leaving now.

10
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,390
Are you new here?
Have not seen you around.

11
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,660
I am a temporary replacement.

12
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,390
How do you know my surname is Luo.

13
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,630
You and the actress picture appeared
in the  magazine,

14
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,150
concerning a foreign trip to overseas.

15
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,990
Dont believe in the crap published
in the magarzine.

16
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,760
However, your personality is different from what
it is reported.

17
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,270
Thats my gut feel.

18
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,900
The elevator is here.

19
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,510
Please

20
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,630
Are you going to the lobby
or the parking lot?

21
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,510
Lobby

22
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,950
So how careless people can be?

23
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,310
I have been watching the place,
have not seen anyone going into the room.

24
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,510
We are cooperating with
several departments,

25
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,870
you need full concentration,
understand?

26
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,470
Ye sir, I understand.

27
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,390
Okay, everybody listen here

28
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,070
These three people are major shareholder
of Fenghua International Group.

29
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,960
Xu Wei, Fei Kwok-Xing

30
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,070
and Luoyao Ming which you have met just now.

31
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,110
Commercial Affair Department

32
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,030
suspected them to be involved in
several cases of insider trading.

33
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,620
as well as the manipulation
of cases.

34
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,830
Therefore, they need to be monitored
every 24 hours

35
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,510
All I ask from you gentlemen and ladies are..

36
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,390
No matter what have they done and
whom they have met..

37
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,550
Including all the communication details
must be recorded.

38
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,350
Is it clear?

39
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:34,990
Yes sir, its clear.

40
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,310
Sir,

41
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,990
We found the target site
and dont know whether it is useful.

42
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,910
We depend on your team, my friend.

43
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:53,110
This task undertaken by our Intelligence Unit

44
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,710
is to be responsible for electronic
eavesdropping surveillance.

45
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,470
Ah Jun, can we start the test?

46
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:56,990
No problem.

47
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:57,750
Okay, lets begin.

48
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,870
Sir, there is no one at the target place,
we cant do the test now.

49
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,670
Channel One is working.

50
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,030
Channel 2 is working.

51
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,540
Channel 3 is working.

52
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,710
Channel 4 is working.

53
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,750
Channel 5 is working.

54
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,630
Channel 6 is working.

55
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,910
Channel 7 is working.

56
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,430
All channels are working perfectly.

57
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,750
So who will be responsible for
shutting down the system?

58
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,350
It has a timer system and it will
shut down automatically.

59
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,230
It all depends on your team now whether
we could gather evidence.

60
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,390
You are most welcomed.  Once the case is over,
just buy me dinner will be sufficient.

61
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,510
No problem at all, bring along
your wife as well.

62
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,270
Settled then.

63
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,830
I shall return to the headquarters now.

64
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,550
Okay.

65
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,150
Okay guys, listen to the schedule
for the task watch list.

66
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,830
Morning shift shall consist of tree,
squirrel and myself.

67
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,430
Confirmed.

68
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,020
NIght shift shall consist of Ah Jun, Yang Zhen and
Xiao Siang.

69
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,710
I am always stuck in the night shift roster.

70
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,470
If you are not happy with the arrangement,

71
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,710
we shall swop with each other.

72
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,430
Not necessary, Lao Yang and Xiao Sang
are used to work with me.

73
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:19,910
Right?

74
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:20,590
Right.

75
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,390
Why, are you upset?

76
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,780
No, how dare we be upset.

77
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,430
Hey, what kind of attitude is this?

78
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,710
If you are not happy,
bring it out then.

79
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,350
Come here.

80
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:32,950
No respect at all.

81
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,290
Thank you for what you did just now.

82
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,110
What are you laughing?

83
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,920
We have been partners for so long,
you know my character.

84
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,270
Commercial Crime Bureau, said

85
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,070
there is a very good chance to
seize the evidence this time.

86
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,710
They let me select the team and
thats how I make the arrangement.

87
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,550
You know jolly well Lao Yang's temper.

88
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,620
I know that he has capture
the most wanted man. Well

89
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,270
But the statements was
written in a mess.

90
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,950
The culprit got acquited and I was
given a lecture by my boss.

91
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,870
It almost severe our relationship
as brothers.

92
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,750
You must not be over
protective of him.

93
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,750
Show more concern for Xiao Siang.

94
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,620
This guy is not bad and
has a great future.

95
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,710
I understand and I can still
cope with the two of them.

96
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,950
However, on the CCB side,

97
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,950
They are responsible for commercial crimes

98
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,580
They are more on the admin task
and less practical experience on the ground.

99
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,430
They are not even aware of Mr Luo going up
to the office.

100
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,590
I shall make a report on their
carelessness.

101
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,630
Let it go.

102
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,430
We shall request for more
reinforcement next time.

103
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,310
We need to teach them a lesson

104
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,230
You are always so gentle with them.

105
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,070
Everything does not matter...
let bygones be bygones.

106
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,900
You keep laughing everytime,
What's so funny?

107
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,870
The more you laugh,
the more I get angry..

108
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,070
Why get so agitated?

109
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,190
Maybe I need to change
my attitude.

110
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,270
Ms Law has commented that
recently, I am

111
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,430
More and more foul temper

112
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,270
What happend to both of you?

113
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:30,870
Nothing.

114
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,590
Wan Er and myself have intention to
visit our son in England next month.

115
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:45,400
- Great.
- What are you guys doing there?

116
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,270
Are you sure you are allowed to
smoke at the working area?

117
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,500
The room is filled with smoke.

118
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,870
Stop smoking and stub out
the cigarettes.

119
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,040
Everything you also want
to have a say.

120
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,390
I said it once again, stub out
your cigarettes.

121
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,430
Sorry sir, he is in the
process of quitting.

122
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,340
Go and have a pee.

123
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,660
Going to the toilet to smoke...

124
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,630
Pass me a lighter.

125
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,710
This is not the one.

126
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,510
The one I need is where you got it
on the opposite side of the street.

127
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,550
You dare to commit and
no guts to admit?

128
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,190
This lighter belongs to that Mr Luo.

129
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,670
It has been installed with
eavesdropping devices by someone.

130
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,350
I'll check at the store with Mr Wang
later at the Electronic City.

131
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,390
To determine which channels they are using
and there may be some clue.

132
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,830
You can also check out the
books station.

133
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,270
See if we can detect who are
playing dirty tricks.

134
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,860
Do you know the size of
the area involved?

135
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,580
By the time you got the result,
the case is already closed.

136
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,470
Whats the matter?

137
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,670
Do you think I will turn
against Ah Jun?

138
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,750
Do you know how many years
we know each other?

139
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,030
Do you know what is the
relationships between us?

140
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,310
Do you know how many times
Ah Jun saved my life?

141
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,230
Sorry for nosey.

142
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,070
Its alright.

143
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,190
Have to be nosey cos you always
claimed shortage of money?

144
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,070
If I want to be greedy,
I will rather go for a bigger sum instead.

145
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,310
At least a minimum of 1 million.

146
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,510
Brother Yang, you are not ambitious.

147
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,740
1 million is already enough for you?

148
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,310
Thats true, I dont have the kind
of life as you do.

149
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,270
Let me check....

150
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,070
Branded watch... how much is it?

151
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,110
Gift from Jenny?

152
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,710
Nope, from father in law
as a wedding gift.

153
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,910
Congratulations to you, Xiao Siang

154
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:49,870
Congratulations to you.

155
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,950
Nothing to be happy.

156
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,030
In future, I need to play golf
every Mon, Wed and Fri.

157
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,430
Why complain as this is the life of
the riches and powerful.

158
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,510
You are lucky they dont
look down on you.

159
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,830
Dont make excuses..

160
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,350
Do not laugh at me
Brother Yang.

161
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,430
Lend me to wear it.

162
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,710
Dont  behave so petty,
I just wear it for two days.

163
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,670
Boss, its a good shot.

164
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,820
Good shot.

165
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,590
You are late again.

166
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,470
Good morning, Father in law.

167
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,230
I just drive over after work,
sorry for being late.

168
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,710
Good morning.

169
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,550
Good morning sir.

170
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,270
Just call my name after office hour.

171
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,070
Yes sir.

172
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,830
Your superior Director is good
in coaching newbie.

173
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,030
You need to learn fast.

174
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,230
I know that, father in law.

175
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,510
Let me carry it,

176
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,350
You are here to play golf.
Not as an attendant/

177
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,110
Do not get used to people
ordering you.

178
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,860
Your father in law loves to give orders.

179
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,630
Mum, younger brother is
having a nosebleed.

180
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,830
Dont be afraid, mum is here.

181
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,910
Come...come..

182
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,270
Mom will sing a song for you.

183
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,990
<Little good bunny, open the door>

184
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,150
<Open the door quickly, I want to come in>

185
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:30,950
Its going to be alright.

186
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,870
Good boy.,,

187
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,150
Good boy.....

188
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,230
Its okay now, let Dad
give you a kiss,

189
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,030
Good boy, go to bed.

190
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,910
Xiao Guang looking for you

191
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,620
Do you mind?

192
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,020
No

193
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,430
Its over between him and me.

194
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,870
The divorce certificate between
Guang and me is out already.

195
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,580
Its just that he has not collected it.

196
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:49,390
Since it is over, why do you
still need to stay at his house?

197
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,830
He has left the house estate for
me and the son.

198
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,700
He has already moved out.

199
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,470
If you are willing, you can
move into the house with me.

200
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,590
He is my friend.

201
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:11,510
When he was with me before we separated,
both of you cant be buddies.

202
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,990
Now we are separated...

203
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,070
You said he is your buddy.

204
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:18,790
Until now, he has not mention 

205
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,260
anything in front of others shows he

206
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,430
was still hopeful about the
relationship with you.

207
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,030
I am not interested in his intention.

208
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,750
Do you know how hard during our
separation period.

209
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,750
He failed to relocate his belongings
even after several months.

210
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,430
He called me every day.

211
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,030
And said that we must go to
England to see his son.

212
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,110
Whenever I want to make
it clear to him.

213
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,750
He says he is busy or...

214
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,270
he could not understand
what is happening

215
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:54,990
I know you are tired but
I've tried my best.

216
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,310
I am sorry.

217
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,470
Please do not be angry,
darling okay?

218
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,110
Please say no more or we end
up quarrelling again.

219
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,710
What are you highlighting?

220
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,310
These few stock prices rose
today by several cents.

221
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,310
If you will to buy accordingly,
how much can you earn?

222
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,990
Twenty cents profit for
every dollar purchased.

223
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,110
That is still not much.

224
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,510
Information indicates that there are
50 million dollars transaction done.

225
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,670
They are big timers, whats 10
millions to them.

226
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,070
It seems there are more
goodies yet to come.

227
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,590
I am not a fool, dont think its
so easy to make 10 millions.

228
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,070
We earn only more than 20,000
a month working so hard.

229
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,670
It will be unfair if I dont
put them in jail.

230
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,510
Place it over there will do.

231
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,710
Come and collect money from me.

232
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,510
Xiao Siang, what is he doing in
FengHua International?

233
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,510
Inspecting the system and equipment there.

234
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,310
What is he checking?

235
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,670
Generally speaking, long-range
eavesdropping devices will emit noise.

236
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,150
The electrical noise can be
detected by electronic signal.

237
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,740
However, the equipment we used
are housed on the jammer.

238
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,470
The other party will not
be able to detect the devices.

239
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,910
However, jammers itself will emit noise.

240
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,750
The noise will then...

241
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,430
affect our surveillance system.

242
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,550
Are our equipment behind time?

243
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,230
Of course not, nowadays there is no need to install eavesdropping devices with the latest technology.

244
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,670
Give me your cell phone

245
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,390
Every person has some tracking device.

246
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,710
By inputting the mobile phone
number into the GSM jamming set,

247
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,270
You can track the parties concerned.

248
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,230
Even if the other party does not start

249
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,710
As long as the battery is not
removed, the set can be traced

250
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,950
Your mobile phone number

251
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,260
92727O31

252
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,870
O31

253
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,910
Testing 123....

254
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,510
Isnt this very dangerous?

255
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,110
That may not be because the machine
may not be smarter than the human.

256
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,270
Look

257
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:15,070
He removed the batteries and
we cant do anything now.

258
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,300
You go ahead to get the time recorded.

259
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,070
Lend me a lighter as I need to
go out for a smoke.

260
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,710
I come along as well.

261
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,350
I got another lighter from Mr Wang
and the channel frequency is 100.

262
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,750
Off your mobile phone.

263
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,340
Why do I need to off my mobile phone?

264
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,550
Just do as I said.

265
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,990
Why didnt you pick up my
call this afternoon?

266
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,030
I was not free.

267
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,550
You went to Lau Xu place?

268
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,590
It does not matter to you

269
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,950
After work where will you be?
Come to my place if there isnt anything.

270
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,870
Already hinted to you that they
have something going on there.

271
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,190
You lose, 100 dollars please.

272
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,070
Mary is not with Lau Xu Jinglei instead.

273
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,390
You dare to lay hand on Crime Xu
Jinglei's girlfriend?

274
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,830
Both of you have nothing better to do?

275
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,590
Just for kick..

276
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,900
Tell me what is the kick?

277
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,510
Go on, speak...

278
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,350
Whats the matter, is there new event?

279
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,300
There really is something going on..

280
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,750
This is the new secretary called Lin Yi-ling..

281
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,310
Ah Zou, start recording.

282
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,870
We need to record the boss
flirting with the Secretary?

283
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,950
You never notice her designer clothers?

284
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,790
Just the underneath clothing
costs more than $3,000.

285
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,500
You look at those pieces of
shirts and skirts

286
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,630
And the branded watch on her wrist.

287
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,830
A junior secretary's salary is
about $7,000 per month.

288
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,590
She deserved to be on the watch list.

289
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:03,170
Why are you guys so disgusting.

290
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:07,710
Good morning,

291
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,510
Good morning, sir.

292
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,940
Good morning

293
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,990
Any new event takes place?

294
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,150
No event or issues...

295
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,150
Off duty then..

296
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,390
Okay...

297
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,900
Good morning

298
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:23,910
Good morning

299
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,100
In my whole life, I have only lived in a 700 sq feet house considering the biggest..

300
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,020
I never realise the toilet here is
bigger than my bedroom.

301
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,670
I'm afraid I need time to adjust
to this environment.

302
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,230
Dad was here looking at the
renovation the last time.

303
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,870
He remiinds us to change the
bathroom water faucet to gold color.

304
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,550
I know you do not like the idea.

305
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,990
You give in to my Dad and he
will ask for more.

306
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,390
If you do not like the idea,
you have to bring it up. Understand?

307
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,470
A Hong Kong police commissioner's salary is...

308
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,710
181.05 thousand a month

309
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,560
In our group as a Security Director

310
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,060
His annual salary is 4.5 million.

311
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,110
Slightly more than commissioner except
not staying at Government House.

312
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:19,620
Hong Kong has more than 30,000 police
officers but there is only one Commissioner.

313
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,550
Your monthy salary is about $20,000,

314
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,030
When can you take the seat
of the Comissioner?

315
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,020
Since there is no prospect,
tender your resignation next month.

316
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,630
Come to my company to work

317
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,910
I know that you are taking care of my interest,
but I still want to

318
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,470
You need to understand, I am
doing it for my daughter sake.

319
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,910
As you will be getting married onext month,
quickly tender in your resignation as soon as possible.

320
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,550
I am going out for a smoke

321
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,990
Waiting for me here

322
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,190
You already know me for a long time.

323
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,630
You know I am not a casual person.

324
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,390
Dont play anymore as I cannot
afford to lose this relationship.

325
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,190
Just make it clear to Xu Jinglei,
I dont want to act like a thief.

326
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,630
Are you still a man?

327
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,470
What do you mean?

328
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,550
How many times you want me
to say it to you?

329
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,590
You are the first to know me
but you ran off when he appears.

330
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,950
When I have problems with him,
you came back looking for me again.

331
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,310
Now you want me to be responsible?

332
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,230
Well yes because I am afraid

333
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,350
Who doesnt  know the
character of Xu Jinglei,

334
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,670
Can you think about me?

335
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,790
Lets go

336
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,430
Why are you so anxious to come back?

337
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,740
Come back to collect something.

338
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,110
What is so important

339
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,430
Can not tell you

340
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,510
You do not say then I go off now.

341
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,110
Well

342
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,670
I can only tell you but do not tell others

343
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,710
Take out your phone batteries first.

344
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,750
This is a secret.

345
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,550
Watchout the stock price of Company tomorrow.
It should increase to $1.20 a share.

346
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,870
The closing price for
today is only 22 cents.

347
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,350
Wow, we will make a fortune then.

348
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,870
Do not buy too much.

349
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,350
Dont blame me if you cannot
let go later.

350
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,070
If I follow you,  I will never be able
to escape from you?

351
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,950
Lets go to the yacht.

352
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:27,870
Fine,

353
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,830
Lets get something to eat
because I am hungry.

354
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,870
Later I will let you eat me.

355
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,190
You are so bad,
Taking advantage of me.

356
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,910
Xiao Siang

357
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,830
Did you record the conversation just now?

358
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,270
Yes, I did.

359
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,950
Any problem?

360
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,300
I was wondering...

361
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,500
Whether to erase it..

362
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,430
My son is sick, I need money

363
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,990
I beg you

364
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,950
Why do they come back?

365
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:32,910
Please see yourself.

366
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:49,260
Dance is not over so why you hurry to come back

367
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,670
Get something back

368
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,070
What is so important

369
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,430
Can not tell you

370
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,030
You do not say I left the

371
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,510
Well I can only tell you but do not tell others

372
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,670
Before we go 
to the yacht, I am hungry....

373
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,700
We might as well have something to eat

374
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,190
OK.  I will let you eat until you..

375
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,590
I give you so

376
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,230
Xiao Siang, why are you recording
this silly conversation?

377
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,980
If you think it is useless, then erase it.

378
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,020
Lets go.

379
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,140
Good morning.

380
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:41,070
Your account can be
effected now.

381
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,590
Thank you.
Lets have lunch when we are free.

382
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,990
Brother Yang.

383
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,030
How is it?

384
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:53,990
Settled.

385
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,270
$200,000, thats all my property.
It is what I have left.

386
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,830
Do you know what you are doing?

387
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,830
Destruction of evidence, obstruction of justice
and failure to report..

388
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,150
Dont tell me you guys do not know
the seriousness of the crime.

389
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,150
Go back and reinstate the record,
I will plead with Xiao-Guang on your case.

390
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,600
Boss

391
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,830
Insider information are everywhere
on the streets

392
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,870
Any normal person would do the 
same thing. Since there is no harm...

393
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,630
This is not an excuse to do wrong thing.

394
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,390
Ah Jun

395
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,790
Ah Jun,  listen to me

396
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,190
A few days ago I took my son
for physical examination,

397
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,230
My son will be well soon

398
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,830
But I will have something

399
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:51,910
Liver cancer

400
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,630
Doctors said that I have a
year to live. I beg you

401
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,990
I want to leave some money for my family...
for my wife and kid

402
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,990
Lets go outside and talk about it.
Lets go.

403
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,910
Its too late

404
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,710
I borrow five million to purchase the stock.

405
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,180
$5,000,000

406
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,590
Are you crazy?

407
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,670
Trading commence

408
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:47,110
Look, the share price is moving up...

409
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,510
Only 7 million transacted.

410
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,310
I alone already purchase 5 million and
of course the price will increase

411
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,710
What do you mean?

412
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,200
Hello,  Good then,

413
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,270
Whats the matter?

414
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,990
- We are buying at an average price of 27 cents.
- Isnt it supposed to be 20 cents?

415
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,750
You are buying at a higher price?

416
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,470
Are you sure you know what you are doing?
Thats all I have left....Brother

417
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,390
You are killing me?

418
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,510
I have bought 5 million and if the
price doesnt move up

419
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,270
Then this stock is totally worthless

420
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:09,950
What do you mean

421
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,510
Now the price is moving up progressively

422
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,630
Sometimes there may be shortage of stocks

423
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,870
Hey, is it true?

424
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,360
8822 ah

425
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,670
Thank you, thank you

426
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,310
8822 fast recovery fast recovery

427
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,310
This group of people are seriously
buying the stock.

428
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,030
I just have my fortune read

429
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,990
The fortune teller told me
that I must pursue

430
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,030
I will also pursue...

431
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,590
8822 is going up ...8822 is going up...

432
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,170
Going up....up

433
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:42,310
Today, we must bring up
the price of FengHua stock

434
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:44,790
Otherwise how can we attract
people coming in

435
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:45,940
Thats it,

436
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,190
Brother Qiu

437
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,590
Good morning, Mr Ma

438
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,270
A bowl of pork chop noodles

439
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,390
Sandwiches and ice tea.

440
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:06,990
Alright,

441
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:07,670
Thank you.

442
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,910
Sources saying that Fenghua is negotiating
the acquisition by the foreigners

443
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,380
at a base price of $1.20

444
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,230
There is saying that

445
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,750
Fenghua bought a piece of land and
there is oil under the ground

446
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,140
Is it true?

447
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,110
Prices going up?

448
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,350
Have we made enough?

449
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,750
Sell now...sell

450
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,270
Sell now? Cant you see the price is
still moving up?

451
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,750
We have already made a profit of 10 million.
What more do you want?

452
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,230
You see the price is still moving up.

453
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,150
We wait till it reaches $1.00
then we let go? Alright?

454
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,390
You go ahead and wait for the price to go up,
I am selling now

455
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,870
Do not rush things, Brother Yang

456
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,950
If we sell now, we can split only a
few millions between us.

457
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,150
A few million is more than enough

458
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,430
What kind of generaton we are taking here,,
A few millions is of no use

459
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,940
Listen to Brother Yang, sell
the entire stake

460
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:50,670
Boss

461
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,350
I said to sell all stake, you hear me?

462
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:54,390
Sell..

463
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,670
Whats going on?

464
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:07,830
What's the matter.

465
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,270
What's going on

466
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,820
Trading of Stock 8822 suspended!!!

467
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,190
Listed Companies Fenghua International

468
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,500
has sharp fluctuations in stock price today.

469
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,870
in view of irregularities, the

There are rumors of aqcuisition
as well as favourable news today

473
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,310
Spokesman of Fenghua International denied 
any news or possible acquisition

474
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,950
The analyser in the stock market 
generally felt that

475
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,830
In the absence of good news and 
without any good background support

476
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,110
Once trading resumes on 
the following Monday

477
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,390
The share price may be under 
enormous pressure

478
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,100
Securites analyst Lu Yong-jian said

479
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,990
According to Fenghua net asset value

480
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,310
The price per share is about 15 cents

481
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,900
I have already said to let 
go the stock

482
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:09,910
Forget it

483
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,150
How can we forget about the matter, 
today is Friday

484
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,230
The following day is a public holiday,
we do not know when will trading resume

485
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,350
The interest already is a 
big burden to us

486
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,020
Its net asser value is only 15 cents

487
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,830
I will be responsible for the 5 million loan

488
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,190
I shall return your two hundred 
thousand as soon as possible

489
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:48,150
Why did you withdraw all the 
money from our saving account?

490
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:48,860
No, I never do it.

491
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,950
If you lie again, I will leave 
immediately.

492
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,030
I used the money to purchase shares

493
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,950
Did you make profit then?

494
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,980
The stock counter has been suspended

495
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,220
Please dont go

496
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,860
I have already confessed and 
yet you still leave

497
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,910
That money is reserved for our 
son medical treatment

498
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,420
If he needs to be hospitalized, 
what will you do?

499
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,030
What about me..

500
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,820
If I am hospitalized, what will happen

501
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,110
What should I do?

502
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,700
Ah Jun, come out and talk

503
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,590
Do you remember about the bed?

504
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,430
You accompany me to buy it

505
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,390
Wan Er throw it away

506
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,270
How things between both of you?

507
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,150
Its all my fault

508
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,750
I had an affair

509
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,150
But I have been already
admit its my mistak

510
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,100
After the incident and for six 
months I have been very nice to her

511
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,820
She has also accepted my apologies

512
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,750
I do not know what happened 
during the last two months

513
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,150
She seem to have changed 
to another person

514
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,150
I do not want to quarrel with her

515
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,390
Hence, I have not gone home 
for the last two months

516
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,270
Yesterday, when I went back home
to collect something

517
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,630
She actually called the estate officer
to look at what I am doing

518
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,500
I entered the room and discovered 
the bed has been changed

519
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,070
She should be seeing 
someone special

520
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,510
Ah Jun

521
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,140
Help me to install a CCTV monitor

522
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,280
I would like to know who is the man

523
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,430
You cant solve the problem 
by doing that

524
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,950
I will be responsible to solve 
my own problem

525
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,190
We have been friends for so many years 
and you are not willing to help me

526
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,350
Xiao Guang requested me to 
mount CCTV monitor

527
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,390
He wanted to know who is the 
men with you

528
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,590
I was thinking to tell him it is me

529
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,470
But I cant open my mouth

530
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,790
I could not even said you are my woman

531
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,550
This matter has nothing to do with 
you had I settle properly with him

532
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,790
Yes I do not know

533
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,420
You are quite right to say 
that I get to know you first

534
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,030
When he started to date you,
I back off

535
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,150
Now you are giving me a second chance

536
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:40,670
And yet, I still want to back off

537
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,030
Soemthing that is obviously right 
has become wrong

538
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,310
I cannot distinguish what is 
right and wrong

539
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,940
I do not deserve your love, I 
think we forget it

540
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,950
It is for me to decide whether it is worth

541
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,270
It is not something that both of 
you can decide

542
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,390
You need to install the CCTV monitor?

543
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,990
Go ahead then..

544
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,830
He wanted to know who is my man

545
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,870
I will let him see

546
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,550
I know the guy that I love

547
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:18,270
He will have the courage to 
come looking for me

548
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,430
Do they have any action on the day 
before yesterday night?

549
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,270
Is there something wrong, Officer Huang?

550
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,740
I want to watch the video 
two nights ago

551
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:45,830
Fine

552
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,140
Ah Jun, prepare the stuff

553
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,430
Laoyang

554
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,390
Wait here for me

555
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,260
Lets go

556
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,750
Why are you so anxious to come 
back since the show is not over yet 

557
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,260
I need to collect something

558
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,910
What is so important

559
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,150
Can not tell you

560
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,350
I am leaving if you do not say

561
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,350
Fine...okay..

562
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,470
I can only tell you but do not 
reveal to others, pass me your mobile

563
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:15,710
Is it because of the signal defective?

564
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,470
Yes, but the fault had been 
repaired during that night

565
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,070
Lets go to the yacht now

566
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:24,910
Okay

567
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,830
First, lets get something to eat as 
I am very hungry

568
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,990
Why is there no record of the activities

569
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,510
I find the contents boring so 
I erased it

570
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,310
I have clearly indicate my intention

571
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,390
No matter whom they met or 
what they said, 

572
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,980
All must be recorded

573
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:59,390
Are you deaf?

574
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,470
Sorry

575
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,710
Fenghua International share price

576
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,430
was manipulated by thiis Group last night

577
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:07,430
The Top Officers have been very 
dissatisfied with the event

578
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,590
From this very minute,

579
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,870
we must fully concentrate to 
leep a close watch on them

580
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:12,670
Understand?

581
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:13,630
Yes sir

582
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,830
Alright.

583
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,430
This is our financial performance 
report for the first half of the year

584
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,590
If you think that is not good enough

585
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,990
Here are our results for our past three 
years profit and loss detailed report

586
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,870
The report on your company's financial year

587
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,470
Have not yet been given to us

588
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:35,590
Its over here

589
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:36,390
Please take a look

590
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,190
Ok

591
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,190
This is the info on the purchase 
of the land

592
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,980
This one is our partner companies of all data

593
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,750
This is related to the all our 
partners financial position

594
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,590
There are the survey report and 
the assessment of the land of the company

595
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,030
The guys from the Securities Regulatory 
Bureaus have left

596
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,020
Come in and talk

597
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,950
Officer Huang

598
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,610
Are we able to receive?

599
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,510
Its too noisy

600
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,910
Try to adjust and we must hear 
what they say

601
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:28,670
Understand

602
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,870
Luo Yaoming is crazy

603
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,830
We have to get him to talk 
about his goods

604
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,750
If the trading resumes and he 
sold the whole cargo

605
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,590
How do we explain to the boss

606
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,870
There is nothing to discuss 
with this person

607
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:59,230
Worst scenario, you and I will 
take over the goods from him

608
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,470
to stabilise the share price
for the meantime

609
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,550
The boss has deposited such a large 
sum of money

610
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,990
If there is anyting wrong, you and me 
would be dead

611
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,940
In fact, I have already talked 
with the boss

612
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,430
He said that Luo Yaoming has 
to be eliminated

613
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:13,980
Go and ask Ah Hua to follow up

614
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:14,830
To kill him

615
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,630
If he is not dead then we will be doomed

616
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,830
I shall tell him that we overhear the 
conversation from another surveillance system 
to Officer Huang

617
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:39,630
How are you going to explain?

618
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:43,030
I will tell him that we hear their 
conversation from another system

619
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,120
Later he ask when and how we 
intercept and when is the cut-off time

620
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,710
Why we did not reported it earlier

621
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:49,510
What you want to say

622
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:53,950
Boss, things we should not hear 
in the first place

623
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,510
We take it that we have no idea at all

624
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:57,350
Its a matter of life and death

625
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,950
If he doesnt die, we have to die

626
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,150
Do you know you are a police officer?

627
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,390
That guy is not a good man

628
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,070
You have to guts to say so

629
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,190
Stop it, we are brothers

630
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,590
Ah Jun, is the guy worth 
for you to be considerate?

631
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,350
Being a member of the Police Force, we should 
know that the truth will surface out eventually

632
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,950
Even we get pass this today, we will 
have to face it the next time

633
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,430
Is there other solution?

634
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,630
Since we lie, we have to lie all the way

635
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:25,630
Ah Jun

636
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,470
Do you know we are aready stuck with it?

637
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:29,270
Ah Jun

638
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,230
Its not easy to go back to normal now

639
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:33,510
Ah Jun

640
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:34,350
Ah Jun

641
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,950
My family will be broken if I dont 
get back my two hundred thousand

642
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,510
I beg you, I beg you Ah Jun

643
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,060
I beg you

644
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:46,950
Get up

645
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,150
Get up

646
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,510
Ah Jun, I was wrong this morning 
and please do not get angry

647
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:58,910
Call me back

648
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,150
Boss, I really can not afford to lose

649
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,390
Consider helping me just for this 
time, okay? Call me back

650
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,830
Ah Jun, for so many years

651
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,550
We have gone through all the hardship

652
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,110
Come out and talk about it

653
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,710
Boss, I am wrong this morning

654
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,270
Whatever you say, I will follow

655
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,630
Give me a call

656
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:38,830
Lao Wu

657
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,190
How long we have not 
seen each other?

658
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,790
More than three years?

659
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,390
So today is a meeting with 
an old friend?

660
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:52,910
Or you have valuable information 
for Independent Commission Against Corruption

661
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,590
Nothing can escape from you

662
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,070
I'm not a fortune-teller

663
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,110
If you do not make it clear, 
how will I know

664
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,980
We heard some thing during 
one of the operation

665
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,470
Can you turn us in as a 
prosecution witness?

666
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,220
I would collect evidence for you

667
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,260
This is a big case

668
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,630
Right

669
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,630
This is indeed a big case

670
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:28,270
But you are not qualified to 
negotiate terms with me

671
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:32,070
I'll tell you from now on, all the 
subsequent action

672
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,630
Must follow the instruction of the ICAC

673
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,460
You have to report to me every day and 

674
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,550
This matter must not be

675
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,060
Disclosed to other department bodies 
so as not to jeopardise the case

676
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,350
I want to catch them 
all at one go

677
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,750
What will happen to Lao Yang 
and Xiao Siang?

678
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,270
You have already make a big mistake 
and yet still talking terms with me

679
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:04,900
I can only promise you that I will 
plea to the judge on their behalf

680
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:09,390
I hope he can accept your mistake and 
be lenient in his judgement

681
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:16,430
Ah Jun, thats are I can do 
for this moment

682
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,670
You too have no other choice

683
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,070
He was forced taking the medicine, 
try to let him spit it out

684
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,190
She saw my face

685
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:08,190
Is it safe here?

686
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,070
Only my girlfriend and myself 
are holding the key

687
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,990
She went out a and will be 
back only in one week time

688
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,510
Brother

689
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,430
I was instructed by other, 
please let me go

690
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,270
I have two hundred thousand, 
I shall give all to you

691
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:30,620
Its okay, do not panic

692
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:57,910
God bless

693
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:04,070
God bless me I dont to have to 
dump the share

694
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,310
God bless

695
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,310
No need for second thought, once 
trading resume, we will sell all

696
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:17,150
Of course, this junk stock is 
not worth a penny

697
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,430
Rumours that the Company has liability of 
more than 100 millions

698
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,670
In that case, the securities regulatory 
bureaus has to perform a thorough check

699
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:34,310
Trading commence

700
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:43,180
The counter is still under suspension..

701
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,350
See what I mean, there is possbility 
that it will stay longer than expected

702
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:11,860
Xiao Siang

703
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:14,870
Xiao Siang, counter has resumed

704
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,230
What is the use even it resumes

705
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,510
The stock price is dropping so bad

706
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,430
Who will want to buy at this moment

707
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,270
Quickly let go..

708
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:26,990
There is no connection

709
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:27,670
Nothing will happen...

710
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,790
Connected

711
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,540
- Stock 8822....
- Wait...

712
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,110
Whats the matter?

713
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:57,190
Fenghua International resume trading this morning

714
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,990
Close at $2.57 per share

715
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,550
Increase of more than 300 per cent

716
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:02,390
This is unusual for the 
stock price volatility

717
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,750
Securities Regulatory Bureau has yet to 
express their views on this area

718
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,030
The Company spokesman stressed that Fenghua

719
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:10,550
Show the public confidence and 
it is completely normal

720
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,870
Run as your boss is 
going to kill you

721
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:13,830
You betray me

722
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,950
Luo Yaoming ran away

723
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:35,990
Police looking for you everywhere

724
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,670
Contact Stuart Law and he will 
advise you what to do

725
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:41,950
Move along

726
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:44,590
Son, you have to tell your mother

727
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,550
Dad made a lot of money buying stocks

728
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,390
After I am finished with my work, I shall 
pick you folks back from grandma place

729
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:51,390
Ah Guang call me

730
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:54,470
He said that he had gone to the law firm 
and took the divorce certificate

731
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,380
We are now settled once and for all

732
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:02,830
Ah Jun, where are you now? 
I want to see you

733
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,540
I have something to take care

734
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,870
I shall see you later

735
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:07,590
Fine

736
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:08,670
See you later

737
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:09,470
Goodbye

738
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:22,830
20 years ago

739
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,110
I have to do business in California 
for the first time

740
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,790
Imported from Germany, a number of 
cheap second-hand convertible

741
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,190
The first guest was a gangster

742
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:35,030
He got into the car and step on 
the accelerator pedal

743
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,300
Travel 50 miles per hour on the road and he was 
very satisfied with the speed

744
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,350
But he was more worried about 
the car convertible

745
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:43,630
If it rains, the water may leak 
onto the car

746
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:46,030
At that time. how could it rain
in California

747
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:48,510
So I told him not to worry

748
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,670
If there is water leakage, then 

749
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,260
I would open the door and 
jump out of the car

750
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:55,070
Who knows that before I can finish...

751
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,510
Suddenly it began to rain heavily

752
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:00,350
It is damn unlucky

753
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,460
Rain water started to drop on that guy's 
head bit by bit

754
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,500
Do you know what I did during 
that moment?

755
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:40,270
We have to admit our mistake

756
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:42,670
Once we done that, we need to 
change our way

757
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,470
For those who refuse to 
admit and change

758
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,630
I will be able to help him

759
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:50,350
If Fenghua has gone bad tomorrow

760
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:51,430
and the situation is not good

761
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,790
You do not need to jump from the car,
Go jump from the building

762
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:49,430
Ah Jun

763
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:50,910
Sit

764
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,910
I have already taken the 
divorce certificate

765
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,870
It is now finally settled after dragging 
for a long time

766
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,270
It seems a lot easier

767
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:18,830
Lets go for a drink after work

768
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,150
Dont worry, I am okay

769
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:26,310
It is not a big issue. do not worry

770
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:34,470
Sir

771
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:35,230
Sir

772
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,980
Officer Li, dismiss your team

773
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,030
Action abolished

774
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,350
Ah Jun, tell them to tidy up

775
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:54,030
Understand

776
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:57,630
Please come out for a moment

777
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:00,740
Boss,  Officer Huang mobile number

778
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,070
Vice-Chairman of the SFC

779
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:11,670
I lnow him

780
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:15,310
Some people are just too bold

781
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,190
They actually turn aorund the 
stock price several times

782
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,350
That group has been using this 
tactic to make money

783
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:20,830
No respect for the law and order

784
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,830
According to our judegement on 
this Fenghua case

785
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,590
It is not a problem to your 
Intelligence Unit

786
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,350
What do you mean,  you have 
suspicion on me?

787
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:30,590
Right

788
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,860
You have used a lot of human resources 
for the past two months

789
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:35,140
and incurred a lot of expenses 
out of the Government pocket

790
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:37,070
We have great expectations for you

791
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,030
The SFC also oversee our duty?

792
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:40,980
I did not say that

793
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:43,150
This case is handled together by us

794
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,030
Problems and responsibility should be 
shared as a whole

795
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,510
For the past two months,

796
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,830
all Intelligence information collected will 
certainly be analysed in detail

797
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,190
I request you to hand all the 
information of the members now

798
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,270
However, the files in the Intelligence Unit

799
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,150
can only be retrieved by you alone

800
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,870
Please respect my authority

801
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,710
I am not discussing with you but rather 
this is an order for you to obey

802
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:34,950
Thanks

803
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,510
Ah Jun

804
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,350
Lets go up the car and clear the stuff

805
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:11,630
Lets leave Hong Kong once and for all

806
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:14,070
What are you saying...

807
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:16,310
How do you handle your wife and kid?

808
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,910
The computer will be able to 
recover in one night

809
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:23,190
Once they have access to the deleted records
in the hard drive, we are dead

810
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:24,350
I do not want to goto jail

811
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:25,950
Why dont we fo this...

812
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:27,540
We sneak in and destroy the hard drives

813
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:33,550
Here is the police headquarters and 
you guys are really brave

814
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:37,270
The next moment, you guys can 
also kill people

815
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:40,150
So what should we do now?

816
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:43,590
Is there any way? 
You need to think fast

817
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:47,870
I have a plan

818
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:52,830
What is the plan

819
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:55,510
From now on, you have to listen to me

820
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,560
They both insisted on going to 
destroy the evidence

821
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:01,020
I can not delay anymore

822
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,870
That stuff is very important, 
you try to go along with them

823
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:07,550
To collect them back and dont 
let them destroy it

824
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,110
How is the chicken drumstick, Mr Chen?

825
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:13,070
Delicious

826
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:17,350
I always tell my colleagues that in 
the whole department

827
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,950
Xiao Yang is the most caring 
people against me

828
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:21,300
Finished eating and then we can talk

829
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,630
Happen to  pass thtough the stall so 
buy them back to let you taste it

830
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:26,830
If you like it, I have no problem to 
buy it for you

831
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:32,830
Dont fool me.  How can people dont 
collect their winning money?

832
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:34,910
You know my position

833
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:37,030
Suddenly there is a lot of money 
would pose a porblem to me 

834
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,430
Why dont you find a solution for me

835
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,270
Find a way to credit the money without 
going through me

836
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:42,820
What are you saying

837
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,270
Brother, use your professional expertise

838
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:49,030
You must not talk nonsense as I 
have a reputation in this industry

839
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:50,870
I will never do things against the law

840
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:03,990
No one inside theatre now

841
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:15,750
The film is ready, enter now

842
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:06,790
Half a million dollar

843
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:08,420
I said I will not be breaking the law

844
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,310
One Million dollars

845
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:20,990
There is audience entering the scene

846
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,830
3 Million dollars

847
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,140
I have a very good repuation 
in this business

848
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:35,070
4 Million dollars

849
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:36,380
I will only do it for 10 millions

850
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:37,510
6 Million dollars

851
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:38,820
That is a discount to you

852
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,670
You dont even bring along the 
door security card?

853
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:47,070
Sorry

854
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:53,990
Quickly disperse

855
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:55,910
Did you receive?

856
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:23,870
God bless me

857
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,500
that I do not need to 
dump my share

858
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:28,110
God bless

859
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:34,310
God bless me not to dump...

860
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,270
8822 stock is dropping tremendously

861
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:38,430
It is only $1.20 now

862
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,710
There is information that Luo Yaoming 
is letting go his cargo

863
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:41,790
He is obviously going for the money
instead of the goods

864
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:43,220
Did you locate Luo Yaoming?

865
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:44,350
Still no news

866
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:46,670
Quickly locate him

867
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:53,340
I go find Mr Chen and collect 
back the transmitter

868
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:04,030
Why are there so much smoke

869
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:04,830
What's going on

870
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,070
Move along

871
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:56,790
Can I make a phone call?

872
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:10,350
Once the situation outside is better, 
then we can use it

873
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,270
For decades, we have been good citizens

874
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:18,030
Just a wrong turn and we get 
our clothes soaked

875
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:21,270
I found the terminal. 
Do you still remember the lighter?

876
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:25,070
Luo Yaoming eavesdropping lighter can 
only cover 200 meters

877
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,190
I trace the signal and it leads to the terminal 
outside Fenghua

878
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:34,190
Do you still remember that night Luoyao Ming 
suddenly returned back to the company?

879
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:36,710
Several of our colleagues failed to 
see him going upstairs

880
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:39,860
He had been in the building all along

881
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:43,350
Terminal Station ia at 902, He install 
the eavesdropping device on his own

882
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,220
He wanted to trap his boss with the device

883
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:46,830
All the secrets are in 902

884
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:48,340
We must first find it before his boss

885
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:49,270
Go up and check it out

886
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:55,180
Officer Huang said that the boss is

887
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:56,590
Ma Zhihua,, the Chairman of China Industry Group

888
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:59,070
He specializes in underground banks in
illegal betting activities

889
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:00,470
Police,  ICAC, Securities Regulatory Bureau and the

890
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:01,630
Courts cannot prosecute him

891
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:02,670
Do you know the reason?

892
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,670
Because all the witnesses are either suffering 
from memory loss or they have disappeared

893
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:06,190
There are two accountants commiting 
suicide by jumping from the building

894
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,070
Since you know his character, why do 
you still going after him

895
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:14,830
We are daring to do wrong things but 
afraid of doing the right thing

896
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,870
We might as well drop dead

897
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,790
You will die faster if you provoke him

898
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:22,150
The auntie who bought the share together with 
us had jumped from the building this afternoon

899
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:25,670
If we have reported the case, she 
probably would not have commit sucide

900
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,830
I know

901
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:30,910
But I do fear for our lives

902
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,830
You are a cop, why are you so afraid?

903
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:34,670
What are you afraid of?

904
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:49,110
I have divorced with Ah Guang

905
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:51,070
So congratulations

906
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:57,470
We are going off as we have some 
business to take care

907
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:58,510
Lets go

908
01:14:59,400 --> 01:14:59,710
Lets go

909
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:04,190
Move along

910
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:09,940
Did you see it?

911
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:12,470
Are you alright?

912
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:15,470
That is not the .... of Xiao Guang?

913
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,630
Didnt you hear she said that 
they have divorced?

914
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:19,590
Lets go

915
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,550
Hello

916
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:53,670
You have been followed.  
Return to the police station immediately

917
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:54,390
Hello?

918
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:58,270
Xiao Siang!

919
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:01,190
Wheres your cell phone

920
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,070
What happed?

921
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:08,180
My phone signal have been intercepted

922
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:09,270
How is it?

923
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:11,390
Stop playing, lets go home now

924
01:16:11,390 --> 01:16:13,030
Dont be mischevious, go up 
the car quickly

925
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:27,870
Sit further inside

926
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:29,110
Okay, move along

927
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:30,870
You dont feel tired after a day ride

928
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:41,510
<Clapping hands>

929
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:44,500
Thank you everyone. Thank you

930
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:46,830
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen

931
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:49,500
This is an era of collaboration

932
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:53,830
Many business community members 
have said this before

933
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:57,230
The most important thing in a business 
dealings between the partners are

934
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,900
To be honest and talk about credibility

935
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,270
Whether we agree with this argument

936
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:06,260
Personally. I think the most important 
thing between partners

937
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,270
is communication

938
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:11,470
If we have communication problems

939
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:13,710
You will lose connectivity with 
your partner

940
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:16,660
Even can be harmful to your partner

941
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:18,590
Son, quickly sit down. Its dangerous

942
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,670
Be obedient. Quickly sit down

943
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:24,350
This is a matter of life and death.
Very important

944
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:27,060
Sit properly and dont affect your 
father while he is driving

945
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:28,630
I dont give means I will not give

946
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:29,470
Please stop quarelling

947
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:30,070
Hello?

948
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:30,990
Laoyang!

949
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:32,830
Hello? Hello?

950
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:46,390
Laoyang!

951
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:48,310
What happen?

952
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:56,990
With good communication between the bridge

953
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:58,990
When partners are in danger then

954
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:02,110
We can lend a helping hand in time

955
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:05,190
So as to reflect the true faith

956
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:10,830
Thank you, thank you

957
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:14,470
Laoyang

958
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:15,230
Hello??

959
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:17,770
Rushing for time?

960
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:22,590
So you are the man

961
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:31,830
Pull out the gun to shoot me?

962
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,790
 Xiao Guang, No.  Something has 
happened to us

963
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:38,270
Ah Guang, its not what you think

964
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:39,670
Wan Er, you get on the train first

965
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:41,510
Didnt you say you want to 
invite me for a drink

966
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:43,990
So it turned out to be a drink 
for a wedding

967
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,030
Dont talk nonsense

968
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:22,950
Do not be afraid

969
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:38,470
Do not be afraid. 
We have reached the hospital

970
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:41,510
Mr. You can not go in

971
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:42,230
I am a police officer

972
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:43,190
The police also can not enter the room

973
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,070
Ah Jun,  what the inside story 
in this Fenghua's case, 

974
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:49,630
Xiao Yang has been hit by a car 
and the driver has been caught by us

975
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:51,630
The driver criminal record had been very bad

976
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:54,230
Obviously he had taken money 
as a scapegoat

977
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:55,430
Half an hour ago

978
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:56,350
Please give way

979
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,070
Thank you, please give way

980
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:02,070
Half an hour ago we found Xiao Siang car

981
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:03,420
But up to now, we have fail 
to locate him

982
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,430
You are still not talking even after 
what had happened?

983
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:06,940
You are no match for this group of people

984
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:09,030
If you do not cooperate with me

985
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:11,150
Xiao Siang body may be thrown 
from an unknown building

986
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:14,230
What have you heard  
in Fenghua case?

987
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,670
Xiao Guang has been hit 

988
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,350
Crime Squad is coming soon and 
you cannot hide

989
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,910
I will definitely support you if you 
tell me the truth. 

990
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,030
Did you hear what I said?

991
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:29,470
Ah Jun

992
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:30,870
Ah Jun

993
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:33,950
This is your last chance

994
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:37,830
what had happened during the Operation?

995
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,870
My action is in collaboration with the 
Independent Commission Against Corruption

996
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:51,750
You must let me complete 
the assignment

997
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:59,110
All the secrets are in 902

998
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:00,460
We first find it before his boss

999
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:03,750
Ladies and Gentlemen

1000

Today, I am very pleased

1001
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:07,630

Today I am very honored to inform you

1004
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:18,710
Our Rensiao Hall Charity Fund has

1005
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:21,070
Raise an amount of 51.86 million 
in donations

1006
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:23,750
On behalf of the Rensiao Church

1007
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,670
I will like to thank this group 
of philantropists here

1008
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:28,670
for the support during the past year

1009
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:32,470
So as to ensure the needy people 
can get assistance

1010
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:36,230
They can feel the community is caring

1011
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:37,630
Thank you everyone

1012
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:42,390
On the 25th, I have 60 million U.S. dollars 
coming from foreign countries

1013
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:44,950
During that time and in conjunction 
with the charity event and Fenghua stocks, 

1014
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:49,310
Come up with a simple proposal 
like a merger plan to lauder the money clean

1015
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:52,550
Let go some stock to Lin Fei Fang 
Brokers for this two week

1016
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:53,750
To lower the stock price first

1017
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:56,710
What kind of expression is that 
on your face?

1018
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:58,260
You do not want to work

1019
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:03,390
Luen Kwong has a shareholder who claim 
the company has discrepancy in the accounts

1020
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:05,790
They want to find a new accountant 
to re-audit the accounts

1021
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:07,950
What does that mean? 
You cannot handle?

1022
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:11,670
Then you buy an economy class 
flight on your own and fly over to 

1023
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:12,870
have a good talk with the drug lords

1024
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:15,140
We simply find someone to kill him

1025
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:23,150
Are you crazy?

1026
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:26,350
You want to kill people when 
there is account to be audited

1027
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:29,190
Do you think I am a Lunatic Born Killers?

1028
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:32,510
Can you try to talk to him first? 

1029
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:36,830
Afterall it is about money. 
Discuss until he is satisfied

1030
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:41,020
If there is no agreement, make 
a call to Shang Gou and 

1031
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:42,670
Ask him to get some thugs to 
scare the shareholder

1032
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:43,950
We have already done that, Boss

1033
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:48,540
He is not even afraid of Shang Gou?

1034
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:06,550
Talk to him once more

1035
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,710
If he still does not agree, 
get rid of him

1036
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:14,510
Dont use your own mobile during 
these two weeks

1037
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:17,820
Ah Hwa, give two unregistered 
mobile number to them

1038
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:25,870
Boss, Mr Xia is here 

1039
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:29,070
Mr Xia, thanks for coming

1040
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:32,230
How can I dont come when you 
have an official opening?

1041
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:34,510
My salary is paid by the Government 
just to take care of you people.

1042
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:36,540
Who is this gentleman?

1043
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:40,310
Let me introduce, he is commissioner Wu 
of the Independent Commission Against Corruption 

1044
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,830
He is a master in golf

1045
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,800
I have heard friends say Mr. Wu 
is an expert in golf/

1046
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:48,430
If you are free, you must drop in 
at my country club to display your skill

1047
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:50,910
No problem but today, we are 
here to watch your presentation

1048
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:52,550
Come, lets take a picture of the group

1049
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:53,830
Mr Xia

1050
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:55,430
Leave for a memory

1051
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:56,910
Good, one more picture

1052
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:59,710
Church Charity Foundation requested the 
presence of President Rensiao 

1053
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:02,540
As well as UOL Group Chairman, Mr. Ma Zhihua

1054
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:15,590
Thank you.

1055
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:19,030
Today, my personal driver, Ah Cheng

1056
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:21,750
asked me a question, he said "Boss, 

1057
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:26,150
I bought two lots of Chinese 
business group's stock recently,

1058
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:27,950
I do not know whether I can let go now"

1059
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:29,630
I said to him

1060
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:34,030
Our company's current market value is 15.6 billion

1061
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,350
Last year it earned more than one billion

1062
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:37,860
Dividend is 57 cents

1063
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:40,310
Looking at it, the interest is even 
better than bank profits

1064
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:42,830
Should consider for long-term holding

1065
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:45,430
Who knows Ah Cheng asked

1066
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:48,150
Its been half a year

1067
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:50,110
But I have not send you back 
to the Company office

1068
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:53,310
Do you really know what business 
is in the company?

1069
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:58,390
I was puzzled by his question and 
dont know how to reply him 

1070
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:02,540
Before I have time to reply him, 
he uses his mobile to make 

1071
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:04,220
a call to his stock broker

1072
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:07,230
and sold his shares in Chinese 
industry in front of my face 

1073
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:08,950
It seems the price is good

1074
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:13,670
It tempts me to also sell some of my shares.

1075
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:16,870
Hence in the future, 

1076
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:19,350
If you have any questions on the 
China trade stock issues

1077
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:22,700
Please be kind enough to call my 
personal driver Ah Cheng

1078
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:27,670
Thank you

1079
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,110
Ah Cheng had been correct

1080
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:34,340
I have put down all my work for 
the past six months 

1081
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:36,100
Because I have more important

1082
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:37,230
and more meaningful things to do

1083
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:40,910

1084
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:42,190

I want to thank all Rensiao
Hall directors and employees

1089
01:28:58,040 --> 01:28:59,390

1090
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,990

1091
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:07,660

01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:10,230
All the donations are from

1093

U.S. dollars coming from foreign countries

1094
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:17,350
During that time and in conjunction with 
the charity event and the Fenghua stock

1095
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,110
Come up with a simple proposal 
like a merger plan to lauder the money clean

1096
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:23,510
Let go some stock to Lin Fei Fang 
Brokers for this two week

1097
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:25,070
To lower the stock price first

1098
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,670
Independent Commission Against Corruption

1099
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:29,150
Hey. off the video quickly

1100
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:33,550
Hey, find someone to turn off the video

1101
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:36,230
Do you hear me?

1102
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:38,630
What are you doing?
Turn off the video quicki

1103
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:39,870
Quickly turn off the video

1104
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:41,590
Then you buy an economy 
class flight on your own and fly over there to

1105
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:42,900
have a good talk with the drug lords

1106
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:44,190
Afraid

1107
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:45,230
You, what you want?

1108
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:47,900
I am the one that install the monitor.
I have plenty of this kind of evidence

1109
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:49,950
Son of a bitch, you did not die

1110
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:54,910
Your speech is interesting. You always say 
the right things for the wrong things done

1111
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:56,460
Do you know how to distinguish 
the difference?

1112
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:57,670
I do not know what to say

1113
01:29:58,040 --> 01:29:58,430
Ah Hwa

1114
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:01,350
Ah Hwa, where are you?

1115
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:03,590
Ah Hwa has run away after receiving 
money from me

1116
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:07,940
Give me a life

1117
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:12,470
I have 15 million which I 
can give all to you

1118
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:16,270
Whatever you do, you can never earned 
15 million dollars in your lifetime

1119
