11
00:08:21,969 -> 00:08:27,249
Aristophanes said that true love
only found among similar.

12
00:08:21,969 -> 00:08:31,422
It is used to explain the mythology.
In the beginning were men

13
00:08:31,423 -> 00:08:36,317
and women
and something called "androgens".

14
00:08:36,318 -> 00:08:40,443
These androgens were two men in one,
or two women or a man ...

15
00:08:40,442 -> 00:08:47,597
... And a woman. At one point found themselves
very strong and decided to defy the gods.

16
00:08:47,598 -> 00:08:53,606
But did not have
austúcia to Zeus, who ordered Apollo to ...

17
00:08:53,607 -> 00:09:00,089
undo these "wounds". Apollo decides to share them
the chest and belly and just leaves a hole

18
00:09:00,090 -> 00:09:04,492
which is the navel, as a souvenir
this recklessness.

19
00:09:04,493 -> 00:09:10,749
Therefore, Aristophanes says that man
will always seek this

20
00:09:10,750 -> 00:09:15,207
other half of which was partitioned
at first, and when ...

21
00:09:15,208 -> 00:09:21,585
This is ... the other half is then
true love and true happiness.
