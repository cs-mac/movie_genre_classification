00:01:49.31,00:01:51.38
Holy mackerel!

00:01:51.38,00:01:53.46
Call headquarters. Get the lieutenant.

00:02:00.75,00:02:03.87
Holy Christmas![br]That thing's doing about 4,000!

00:02:03.87,00:02:09.07
- But that's incredible, sir.[br]- That can't be aircraft. Must be a buzz bomb.

00:02:11.16,00:02:13.23
This is Luckton at Ferris to Charlie Baker.

00:02:13.23,00:02:18.42
I have a bogey at 200,000 feet.[br]4,000 miles an hour.

00:02:35.09,00:02:38.20
Reports are coming in from[br]all over the Empire, all over the world.

00:02:39.25,00:02:42.37
The government has not yet issued[br]a statement, but there is no question

00:02:42.37,00:02:47.57
that there actually is a large, unidentified[br]object circling the Earth at incredible speed.

00:02:47.57,00:02:49.65
This is Elmer Davis again.

00:02:49.65,00:02:54.87
We still don't know what it is or where it[br]comes from, but there's something there.

00:02:54.87,00:03:00.05
It's been tracked around the Earth by radar,[br]travelling at a rate of4,000 miles an hour.

00:03:00.05,00:03:03.17
This is not another "flying saucer" scare.

00:03:03.17,00:03:09.42
Scientists and military men are already agreed[br]on that. Whatever it is, it's something real.

00:03:09.42,00:03:14.61
We interrupt this programme[br]to give you a bulletin from a naval unit at sea.

00:03:14.61,00:03:19.83
An object travelling at supersonic speed is[br]headed towards the East Coast of the States.

00:03:19.83,00:03:22.95
This is HV Kaltenborn speaking.

00:03:22.95,00:03:28.15
Here in the nation's capital there is anxiety[br]and concern, but no outward sign of panic.

00:03:29.19,00:03:34.38
As a matter of fact, there are signs[br]of normalcy - the beautiful spring weather,

00:03:34.38,00:03:38.55
the tourist crowds around[br]the public monuments and other buildings.

00:05:09.09,00:05:11.16
They're here!

00:05:11.16,00:05:13.26
They're here!

00:05:13.26,00:05:16.36
They've landed! Over on the Mall![br]They've landed!

00:05:59.05,00:06:03.19
- Get me the Chief of Staff.[br]- Thank you. Hold the line, please.

00:06:05.26,00:06:08.39
Hello. I want to speak to the president.

00:06:08.39,00:06:11.51
I'm sorry, but you'll have to interrupt him.

00:06:11.51,00:06:14.63
Good afternoon. This is Drew Pearson.

00:06:14.63,00:06:16.71
We bring you this special broadcast

00:06:16.71,00:06:21.92
in order to give you the very latest[br]information on an amazing phenomenon:

00:06:21.92,00:06:24.00
the arrival of a spaceship in Washington.

00:06:25.04,00:06:29.21
Government and Defense Department[br]officials are concerned by reports of panic

00:06:29.21,00:06:31.30
in several large eastern cities.

00:06:31.30,00:06:37.53
I am authorised to assure you that, so far,[br]there is no reasonable cause for alarm.

00:06:37.53,00:06:42.75
The rumours of invading armies[br]and mass destruction are based on hysteria

00:06:42.75,00:06:44.82
and are absolutely false.

00:06:44.82,00:06:48.97
I repeat, these rumours are absolutely false.

00:06:48.97,00:06:53.14
The ship, designed for travel[br]outside the Earth's atmosphere,

00:06:54.16,00:06:59.38
Landed in Washington today[br]at 3.47pm Eastern Standard Time.

00:06:59.38,00:07:01.46
We still do not know where it came from.

00:07:01.46,00:07:05.61
The ship is now resting[br]exactly where it landed two hours ago,

00:07:05.61,00:07:08.75
and so far there is[br]no sign of life from inside it.

00:07:08.75,00:07:12.91
Troops have been rushed across[br]the Potomac River from Fort Myer

00:07:12.91,00:07:14.99
and have thrown a cordon around the ship.

00:07:14.99,00:07:18.10
They are supported by tanks,[br]artillery and machine guns.

00:07:19.15,00:07:22.27
Behind the police lines[br]there's a huge crowd of curiosity seekers.

00:07:22.27,00:07:27.48
The army has taken every precaution[br]to meet any emergency which may develop.

00:07:28.51,00:07:31.63
Every eye, every weapon[br]is trained on the ship.

00:07:31.63,00:07:36.83
It's been that way for two hours,[br]and the tension is just beginning...

00:07:36.83,00:07:39.94
Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen.[br]I think something is happening.

00:08:43.43,00:08:47.59
We have come to visit you[br]in peace, and with goodwill.

00:11:37.20,00:11:40.31
Gort! Deglet ovrosco!

00:12:00.07,00:12:02.15
It was a gift for your president.

00:12:02.15,00:12:06.31
With this, he could have[br]studied life on the other planets.

00:12:12.57,00:12:16.74
Get that ambulance over here.[br]Take him to Walter Reed Hospital right away.

00:12:17.77,00:12:19.85
Mr Harley, sir, from the White House.

00:12:19.85,00:12:21.93
- General.[br]- Right in there, Mr Harley.

00:12:36.50,00:12:40.66
My name is Harley,[br]secretary to the president.

00:12:40.66,00:12:45.88
I've been told you speak our language,[br]and that your name is Mr... Klaatu?

00:12:45.88,00:12:46.92
Just Klaatu.

00:12:46.92,00:12:51.08
The president conveys his[br]deepest apologies for what happened.

00:12:51.08,00:12:53.15
Sit down, Mr Harley.

00:12:53.15,00:12:55.24
Thank you.

00:12:58.37,00:13:03.55
I'm sure I need hardly point out that[br]your arrival was something of a surprise.

00:13:03.55,00:13:05.64
Had you been travelling long?

00:13:05.64,00:13:08.77
About five months. Your months.

00:13:08.77,00:13:10.85
You must have come a long way.

00:13:10.85,00:13:13.97
About 250 million of your miles.

00:13:16.04,00:13:19.18
Naturally, we are very curious[br]to know where you come from.

00:13:19.18,00:13:21.26
From another planet.

00:13:21.26,00:13:23.34
Let's just say that we're neighbours.

00:13:23.34,00:13:26.46
It's hard for us to think[br]of a planet as a neighbour.

00:13:26.46,00:13:30.61
In the present situation[br]you'll have to learn to think that way.

00:13:30.61,00:13:33.73
- The present situation?[br]- I mean the reason for my coming here.

00:13:33.73,00:13:36.85
We're very curious about that, too.

00:13:36.85,00:13:39.97
- Would you care to talk about it?[br]- I'd be glad to.

00:13:42.04,00:13:44.13
Not now, of course, with you alone.

00:13:44.13,00:13:47.26
You'd rather talk personally[br]with the president?

00:13:47.26,00:13:53.49
This is not a personal matter, Mr Harley.[br]It concerns all the people on your planet.

00:13:53.49,00:13:55.59
I... I'm not sure I understand.

00:13:57.65,00:14:02.87
I want to meet with representatives[br]from all the nations of the Earth.

00:14:02.87,00:14:04.94
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward.

00:14:04.94,00:14:07.04
It's completely without precedent.

00:14:08.07,00:14:13.27
And there are practical considerations -[br]the time involved, the enormous distances.

00:14:13.27,00:14:15.36
I travelled 250 million miles.

00:14:16.39,00:14:18.48
I appreciate that, but...

00:14:19.53,00:14:23.69
I want to be frank with you, Mr...[br]I mean Klaatu.

00:14:24.72,00:14:30.97
Our world at the moment[br]is full of tensions and suspicions.

00:14:30.97,00:14:35.13
In the present international situation,[br]such a meeting would be quite impossible.

00:14:35.13,00:14:37.21
What about your United Nations?

00:14:38.24,00:14:40.33
You know about the United Nations?

00:14:40.33,00:14:43.45
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts[br]for a good many years.

00:14:43.45,00:14:48.66
- That's how we learned your languages.[br]- I'm sure you recognise from our broadcasts

00:14:48.66,00:14:52.82
the evil forces that have produced[br]the trouble in our world. Surely...

00:14:52.82,00:14:55.95
I'm not concerned with[br]the internal affairs of your planet.

00:14:55.95,00:15:00.09
My mission here is not[br]to solve your petty squabbles.

00:15:00.09,00:15:03.20
It concerns the existence[br]of every last creature on Earth.

00:15:03.20,00:15:06.34
Perhaps if you could explain a little...

00:15:06.34,00:15:10.49
I intend to explain.[br]To all the nations, at the same time.

00:15:11.53,00:15:13.62
How do we proceed, Mr Harley?

00:15:15.68,00:15:20.91
Well, we could call a special meeting[br]of the General Assembly.

00:15:20.91,00:15:24.01
But the UN doesn't represent all the nations.

00:15:24.01,00:15:27.13
Then I suggest a meeting[br]of all the chiefs of state.

00:15:27.13,00:15:31.31
Believe me, you don't understand.[br]They wouldn't sit down to the same table.

00:15:32.36,00:15:35.47
I don't want to resort to threats, Mr Harley.

00:15:35.47,00:15:38.60
I merely tell you that[br]the future of your planet is at stake.

00:15:38.60,00:15:42.76
I urge that you transmit that message[br]to the nations of the Earth.

00:15:49.00,00:15:53.15
I will make that recommendation[br]to the president.

00:15:55.24,00:15:59.39
But I must tell you in all honesty,[br]I'm extremely dubious about the results.

00:15:59.39,00:16:03.56
Apparently I'm not as cynical[br]about Earth's people as you are.

00:16:03.56,00:16:07.73
I have been dealing in Earth's politics[br]a good deal longer than you have.

00:16:07.73,00:16:10.86
Good night, sir.

00:16:20.20,00:16:24.38
It is now 2am, and the giant robot[br]still hasn't moved.

00:16:24.38,00:16:28.52
Engineers from nearby Fort Belvoir[br]have failed to budge him,

00:16:28.52,00:16:32.70
and metallurgical experts[br]have found his huge body impregnable.

00:16:32.70,00:16:36.85
They're now concentrating on[br]the ship itself, so far with no results.

00:16:52.46,00:16:54.56
Getting anyplace, Sergeant?

00:16:54.56,00:16:57.67
Oh, no, sir. This beats me, sir.

00:16:57.67,00:17:02.87
I saw the ramp come through the side of the[br]ship right here. Now I can't even find a crack.

00:17:04.96,00:17:08.08
Oh, Carlson. What's the report?

00:17:08.08,00:17:13.28
No luck, sir. We've tried everything[br]from a blowtorch to a diamond drill.

00:17:15.36,00:17:18.50
- What about him?[br]- He's made out of the same stuff.

00:17:18.50,00:17:20.57
- Has he moved, Sergeant?[br]- No, sir. Not an inch.

00:17:20.57,00:17:23.69
This is the toughest material[br]I ever saw, General.

00:17:23.69,00:17:26.82
For hardness and strength,[br]it's out of this world.

00:17:26.82,00:17:29.92
I can tell you officially[br]that's where it came from!

00:17:32.02,00:17:35.14
The skeletal structure's completely normal.

00:17:35.14,00:17:40.34
The tests show the same for major organs -[br]the heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.

00:17:40.34,00:17:42.42
Yeah, and the lungs are the same as ours.

00:17:42.42,00:17:46.58
That must mean a similar atmosphere,[br]similar pressure.

00:17:47.63,00:17:51.78
- How old do you think he is?[br]- Oh, I'd say 35, 38.

00:17:51.78,00:17:54.91
He told me this morning[br]while I was examining him. He's 78.

00:17:54.91,00:17:58.02
- Well, I don't believe it.[br]- Life expectancy is 130.

00:17:58.02,00:18:02.18
- How does he explain that?[br]- Says their medicine's much more advanced.

00:18:02.18,00:18:07.38
He was very nice about it, but he[br]made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.

00:18:12.59,00:18:15.70
I removed a bullet[br]from that man's arm yesterday.

00:18:15.70,00:18:19.87
- Well, what about it?[br]- I just examined the wound, and it's healed.

00:18:19.87,00:18:24.03
- What does he say about it?[br]- Said he put salve on it, stuff he had on him.

00:18:24.03,00:18:28.19
- What are you gonna do with it?[br]- Take it downstairs and have it analysed.

00:18:28.19,00:18:33.40
Then I don't know whether to just get drunk[br]or give up the practice of medicine.

00:18:36.52,00:18:39.63
- Afternoon, Mr Harley.[br]- Good afternoon, gentlemen.

00:18:46.92,00:18:50.03
Good afternoon.[br]I'm glad to see you up and around.

00:18:50.03,00:18:55.25
- Thank you. Have you any news?[br]- Not very good news, I'm afraid.

00:18:56.31,00:19:01.49
The president accepted your suggestion,[br]and cabled the invitations for a meeting.

00:19:04.63,00:19:06.71
Let me read you some of the replies.

00:19:09.82,00:19:13.98
"The premier wishes[br]to inform the US Government

00:19:13.98,00:19:17.10
it will be impossible for him to attend[br]the meeting suggested by the president,

00:19:17.10,00:19:20.24
unless the meeting is held in Moscow."

00:19:21.27,00:19:25.44
"The suggestion of the president[br]of the possibility of a meeting in Moscow

00:19:25.44,00:19:29.58
would be unacceptable to[br]His Majesty's Government at present."

00:19:29.58,00:19:34.79
"Representation could be sent only[br]if the meeting were held in Washington."

00:19:34.79,00:19:36.88
Well, there you have it.

00:19:39.98,00:19:45.20
Now you understand more clearly, perhaps[br]you'd like to discuss it with the president.

00:19:45.20,00:19:48.32
I will not speak with[br]any one nation or group of nations.

00:19:48.32,00:19:52.47
I don't intend to add my contribution[br]to your childish jealousies.

00:19:52.47,00:19:55.60
Our problems are very complex, Klaatu.

00:19:55.60,00:19:58.74
- You mustn’t judge us too harshly.[br]- I can judge only by what I see.

00:19:58.74,00:20:03.92
- Your impatience is quite understandable.[br]- I'm impatient with stupidity.

00:20:03.92,00:20:08.10
- My people have learned to live without it.[br]- I'm afraid my people haven't.

00:20:08.10,00:20:11.21
I am very sorry.

00:20:11.21,00:20:13.28
I wish it were otherwise.

00:20:27.85,00:20:33.07
Before making any decisions, I think[br]I should get out among your people,

00:20:33.07,00:20:38.26
and become familiar with the basis[br]for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.

00:20:38.26,00:20:41.38
Under the circumstances,[br]I'm afraid that's impossible.

00:20:42.44,00:20:45.54
I must ask that you don't try[br]to leave the hospital.

00:20:45.54,00:20:47.63
Our military people have insisted on this.

00:20:47.63,00:20:50.76
I'm sure you understand.

00:21:30.30,00:21:34.46
- The man from the spaceship got away![br]- What? Get every available man.

00:22:09.83,00:22:15.03
Hospital authorities refuse[br]to comment on how he managed to escape...

00:22:21.28,00:22:24.42
He's not eight feet tall, as reported,[br]nor does he have tentacles...

00:22:24.42,00:22:27.52
There's no denying[br]a monster is at large,

00:22:27.52,00:22:31.66
and we are dealing with forces[br]beyond our knowledge and power.

00:22:31.66,00:22:37.90
The public is advised to take ordinary[br]precautions and to remain calm as we await...

00:22:48.30,00:22:50.40
until they've had an opportunity[br]to study the ship.

00:22:50.40,00:22:55.60
They seem to agree, however, that either[br]Venus or Mars is the most likely possibility.

00:22:55.60,00:23:00.81
Not only are these the closest planets[br]to Earth, but all research to date indicates

00:23:00.81,00:23:03.91
they are the only two planets[br]capable of sustaining life as we know it.

00:23:06.02,00:23:10.18
However, all reputable scientists[br]warn against jumping to hasty conclusions.

00:23:10.18,00:23:13.30
Professor Havemeyer of MIT, for example,

00:23:13.30,00:23:16.41
points out it’s possible,[br]in light of our meagre knowledge.

00:23:16.41,00:23:22.67
The president has urged all citizens to be on[br]the alert for any information about this man,

00:23:22.67,00:23:27.85
and to transmit such information immediately[br]to the police, the army or the FBI.

00:23:27.85,00:23:30.98
While the president made no effort[br]to minimise the crisis,

00:23:30.98,00:23:35.15
he urged people all over the country[br]to remain calm.

00:23:35.15,00:23:38.27
And I might add, that though[br]this man maybe our bitter enemy,

00:23:39.30,00:23:41.39
he could be also a new-found friend.

00:23:41.39,00:23:46.60
- Unfortunately, the only photos we have...[br]- Mom, do you think I could...?

00:23:46.60,00:23:49.71
- Hey, who's that?[br]- ..do not show the man's face.

00:23:49.71,00:23:54.93
The president said the entire facilities[br]of the FBI and every other federal agency

00:23:54.93,00:23:57.01
are being brought to bear.

00:23:57.01,00:24:01.15
He pointed out, however,[br]that this is no ordinary manhunt.

00:24:01.15,00:24:05.31
He warned "We maybe up against[br]powers that are beyond our control..."

00:24:14.68,00:24:19.90
- What is it you want?[br]- My name is Carpenter. I need a room.

00:24:19.90,00:24:21.97
- Oh, I see.[br]- Are you an FBI man?

00:24:24.06,00:24:28.22
- No, I'm afraid not.[br]- I'll bet he is. He's looking for the spaceman.

00:24:28.22,00:24:30.31
We've all been hearing[br]too much about spacemen.

00:24:30.31,00:24:33.41
- This is Mrs Benson, Mr Carpenter.[br]- How do you do?

00:24:33.41,00:24:35.50
And little Bobby.

00:24:35.50,00:24:39.67
- Mr and Mrs Barley. And Mr Krull.[br]- How do you do?

00:24:39.67,00:24:41.73
And I'm Mrs Crockett.

00:24:42.79,00:24:47.99
I have a very nice room on the second floor.[br]It gets the sun all day long.

00:24:47.99,00:24:51.11
Can I help you look for the spaceman?[br]I know what he looks like.

00:24:51.11,00:24:57.34
- He's got a big square head with three eyes.[br]- That's enough, Bobby. It's late. Excuse me.

00:24:57.34,00:25:01.51
We mustn't annoy Mr Carpenter,[br]or he won't want to stay here.

00:25:02.55,00:25:05.66
He's really a dear little boy,[br]and quiet as a mouse.

00:25:06.72,00:25:10.87
- You're a long way from home, aren't you?[br]- How did you know?

00:25:10.87,00:25:14.00
Oh. I can tell a New England accent[br]a mile away.

00:25:17.11,00:25:22.32
Now we take you to Miami Beach,[br]Florida, fork report from Gabriel Heatter.

00:25:22.32,00:25:23.37
Mr Heatter?

00:25:23.37,00:25:27.51
And now on this Sunday morning[br]we ask some questions

00:25:27.51,00:25:30.63
that have been haunting[br]the entire nation for two whole days.

00:25:30.63,00:25:35.85
This creature: where is he? What is he up to?

00:25:35.85,00:25:38.95
If he can build a spaceship[br]that can fly to Earth,

00:25:38.95,00:25:43.13
and a robot that can[br]destroy our tanks and guns,

00:25:43.13,00:25:46.25
what other terrors can he unleash at will?

00:25:46.25,00:25:49.36
Obviously, the monster must be found.

00:25:49.36,00:25:51.44
He must be tracked down like a wild animal.

00:25:51.44,00:25:53.53
He must be destroyed.

00:25:54.58,00:25:56.67
But where would such a creature hide?

00:25:56.67,00:25:59.77
Would he disappear into the north woods?

00:25:59.77,00:26:03.95
Would he crawl into the sewers[br]of some great city?

00:26:03.95,00:26:07.07
Everybody agrees there is grave danger.

00:26:07.07,00:26:11.22
The question remains:[br]what can we do to protect ourselves?

00:26:11.22,00:26:17.47
What measures can we take to neutralize this[br]menace from another world?

00:26:17.47,00:26:20.60
Destroy it? Of course, but how?

00:26:20.60,00:26:24.75
And if we do destroy it,[br]what do we face in retaliation?

00:26:24.75,00:26:29.97
- It's not a simple problem...[br]- George, turn it off. I'm trying to concentrate.

00:26:29.97,00:26:32.04
Why doesn't the government do something?

00:26:33.09,00:26:35.16
What can they do?[br]They're only people, like us.

00:26:35.16,00:26:38.29
People, my foot! They're Democrats.

00:26:38.29,00:26:39.32
It gives you the shakes.

00:26:40.36,00:26:44.53
He's got that robot standing there,[br]just waiting for orders to destroy us.

00:26:44.53,00:26:48.69
This spaceman, or whatever he is.[br]We automatically assume he's a menace.

00:26:48.69,00:26:51.81
- Maybe he isn't at all.[br]- Then what's he hiding for?

00:26:51.81,00:26:55.98
- Why doesn't he come out in the open?[br]- Like Heatter says, "What's he up to?"

00:26:55.98,00:26:59.08
- Maybe he's afraid.[br]- He's afraid!

00:26:59.08,00:27:03.24
Well, after all, he was shot[br]the minute he landed here.

00:27:03.24,00:27:08.46
- I was just wondering what I would do.[br]- Perhaps before deciding on any action,

00:27:08.46,00:27:12.61
you'd want to know more about the people,[br]to orient yourself in a strange environment.

00:27:12.61,00:27:18.86
- There's nothing strange about Washington.[br]- A person from another planet may disagree.

00:27:18.86,00:27:23.02
If you want my opinion,[br]he comes from right here on Earth.

00:27:23.02,00:27:25.10
And you know where I mean.

00:27:26.14,00:27:28.22
They wouldn't come in a spaceship.[br]Only planes.

00:27:28.22,00:27:30.32
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

00:27:31.35,00:27:34.47
That fellow wants something,[br]otherwise he wouldn't be here.

00:27:34.47,00:27:36.55
That right, Mr. Carpenter?

00:27:36.55,00:27:38.63
I'm a little confused.

00:27:39.66,00:27:42.80
Oh, Mrs. Benson,[br]Mr. Stevens is here to see you.

00:27:42.80,00:27:44.87
Oh, thank you. Excuse me.

00:27:44.87,00:27:49.03
George, finish your coffee. I promised[br]the Carsons I'd be there at 11.

00:27:51.11,00:27:53.19
- Good morning.[br]- Good morning.

00:27:54.26,00:27:59.44
We're set. I put gas in the car and the radio's[br]broken, so we can forget about the spaceman.

00:27:59.44,00:28:02.58
There's one thing.[br]I haven't anyone to stay with Bobby.

00:28:02.58,00:28:06.74
- I don't suppose we could take him with us?[br]- Well... Well, we could.

00:28:06.74,00:28:10.90
There's always someone here,[br]but today they've all got plans.

00:28:10.90,00:28:12.97
I haven't any plans.

00:28:14.02,00:28:17.13
I'd be happy to spend the day with him,[br]if you’d let me.

00:28:17.13,00:28:20.26
Say, that would be great. Wouldn't it?

00:28:20.26,00:28:22.34
It's awfully nice of you to suggest it.

00:28:23.37,00:28:26.50
- Sorry. Mr. Carpenter, this is Tom Stevens.[br]- How do you do, Mr. Carpenter?

00:28:26.50,00:28:28.57
Hello.

00:28:28.57,00:28:32.74
Bobby and I had a fine time yesterday[br]afternoon. We talked and listened to the radio.

00:28:32.74,00:28:36.90
I thought today he might like[br]to show me around the city.

00:28:37.95,00:28:41.06
- Well...[br]- Suppose I ask Bobby how he feels about it?

00:28:41.06,00:28:43.15
Fine.

00:28:44.19,00:28:46.27
- You think it's all right?[br]- Sure.

00:29:00.84,00:29:02.91
That's my father. He was killed at Anzio.

00:29:20.61,00:29:23.74
Did all those people die in wars?

00:29:23.74,00:29:26.84
Most of 'em. Didn't you ever[br]hear of the Arlington Cemetery?

00:29:26.84,00:29:31.01
- No, I'm afraid not.[br]- You don't seem to know much of anything.

00:29:32.07,00:29:36.21
Well, I'll tell you, Bobby,[br]I've been away a long time. Very far away.

00:29:36.21,00:29:39.33
Is it different where you've been?[br]Don't they have places like this?

00:29:39.33,00:29:42.46
They have cemeteries, but not like this one.

00:29:42.46,00:29:45.58
You see, they don't have any wars.

00:29:45.58,00:29:47.66
Gee, that's a good idea.

00:29:48.70,00:29:51.82
- What would you like to do?[br]- Go to the movies.

00:29:51.82,00:29:52.86
- All right.[br]- No fooling?

00:29:52.86,00:29:55.98
No fooling.

00:29:55.98,00:30:00.12
Bobby, tell me, do you have[br]to have money to go there?

00:30:00.12,00:30:05.33
- I've got two dollars. Mom gave it to me.[br]- No. I want to take you to the movie.

00:30:06.38,00:30:08.45
Do you think they'd accept these?

00:30:10.54,00:30:11.57
Gee, they look like diamonds!

00:30:11.57,00:30:14.70
In some places,[br]those are what people use for money.

00:30:14.70,00:30:19.90
- They're easier to carry and don't wear out.[br]- I'll bet they're worth a million dollars.

00:30:19.90,00:30:21.99
Would you give me your $2 for two of these?

00:30:21.99,00:30:24.07
Well...

00:30:24.07,00:30:26.16
Sure.

00:30:26.16,00:30:27.18
OK.

00:30:29.27,00:30:32.39
Let's not say anything to Mom[br]about this, though.

00:30:32.39,00:30:36.55
- Why not, Bobby?[br]- She doesn't like me to steal from people.

00:31:00.49,00:31:02.57
Those are great words.

00:31:03.61,00:31:06.75
- He must have been a great man.[br]- Well, sure.

00:31:20.27,00:31:23.39
That's the kind of man I'd like to talk to.

00:31:24.42,00:31:27.53
Bobby, who's the greatest man[br]in America today?

00:31:27.53,00:31:30.66
I don't know. The spaceman, I guess.

00:31:31.70,00:31:35.85
No, I was speaking of earthmen.[br]I meant the greatest philosopher or thinker.

00:31:35.85,00:31:40.02
- You mean the smartest man in the world?[br]- Yes, that would do nicely.

00:31:40.02,00:31:43.15
Professor Barnhardt, I guess.[br]He's the greatest scientist.

00:31:43.15,00:31:46.26
- He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?[br]- Near where Mom works.

00:31:46.26,00:31:49.38
- Where's that?[br]- Department of Commerce. She's a secretary.

00:31:49.38,00:31:54.60
That man they call the secretary isn't at all.[br]My mom's a real secretary.

00:31:55.64,00:31:58.75
Mr. Carpenter,[br]now can we go see the spaceship?

00:31:58.75,00:32:00.84
If you like.

00:32:14.36,00:32:18.52
I'll bet that iron guy's strong[br]and could knock down a whole building.

00:32:18.52,00:32:20.61
I shouldn't be at all surprised.

00:32:20.61,00:32:25.81
I'd like to get inside that ship, see how[br]it works. What do you think makes it go?

00:32:25.81,00:32:29.97
A highly developed form[br]of atomic power, I should imagine.

00:32:29.97,00:32:32.07
I thought that was only for bombs.

00:32:32.07,00:32:35.17
No. No, it's for lots of other things, too.

00:32:35.17,00:32:39.34
- Do you think it can go faster than the F-86?[br]- Yes, I should think so.

00:32:39.34,00:32:42.47
- About 1,000 miles an hour?[br]- Maybe 4,000 miles an hour.

00:32:42.47,00:32:46.62
And outside the Earth's atmosphere,[br]a good deal faster.

00:32:46.62,00:32:48.70
How could they make a landing?

00:32:48.70,00:32:51.83
There are several ways[br]to reduce landing speed.

00:32:51.83,00:32:56.01
You see, the basic problem[br]is to overcome the inertia...

00:32:56.01,00:32:59.10
Keep going, mister. He was fallin' for it!

00:33:03.26,00:33:08.48
Thank you, Mrs. Robinson. I'm sure we've all[br]shared your fears during the past few days.

00:33:08.48,00:33:12.63
I see a gentleman here with his little boy.[br]What do you think of the spaceship, son?

00:33:12.63,00:33:15.75
It's the biggest spaceship I ever saw.

00:33:15.75,00:33:19.92
- And you, sir. Mind telling us your name?[br]- My name is Carpenter.

00:33:19.92,00:33:24.07
Care to say a few words? I suppose[br]you're just as scared as the rest of us.

00:33:24.07,00:33:26.17
In a different way, perhaps.

00:33:26.17,00:33:30.34
I am fearful when I see people substituting[br]fear for reason. In fact, I would...

00:33:31.36,00:33:35.53
Uh, thank you, Mr. Carpenter. Thank you very[br]much. I see another gentleman in the crowd...

00:33:35.53,00:33:39.69
Extra! Extra! Spaceman eludes police![br]Army put in charge.

00:33:39.69,00:33:42.80
Read all about it! Spaceman eludes police!

00:33:42.80,00:33:44.89
Extra! Extra!

00:33:45.93,00:33:49.06
Get your paper here. Army put in charge.

00:33:49.06,00:33:52.17
Extra! Extra! Read all about it!

00:33:52.17,00:33:57.38
- You think they'll ever find him?[br]- I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.

00:33:57.38,00:34:00.50
Mr. Carpenter, what is inertia?

00:34:00.50,00:34:03.62
The property of matter by which[br]it remains in uniform motion

00:34:03.62,00:34:06.74
unless acted upon by external force.

00:34:06.74,00:34:07.78
Oh.

00:34:07.78,00:34:11.95
I'll bet that's just the way[br]Professor Barnhardt talks.

00:34:11.95,00:34:14.03
Bobby, I have an idea.

00:34:15.06,00:34:19.23
- Let's go and find out how Barnhardt talks.[br]- You're kidding!

00:34:19.23,00:34:23.39
- Wouldn't you like to meet him?[br]- Sure I would, but I bet you'd be scared.

00:34:24.44,00:34:27.55
Maybe we can scare him[br]more than he can scare us.

00:34:27.55,00:34:30.68
I like you, Mr. Carpenter.[br]You're a real screwball.

00:34:33.80,00:34:36.90
Extra! Extra![br]Spaceman still at large.

00:34:36.90,00:34:41.07
Extra! Read all about it. Get your paper here.

00:34:51.49,00:34:53.57
Maybe he isn't home.

00:35:00.84,00:35:02.94
Gee, I'll bet you this is where he works.

00:35:24.79,00:35:26.87
What's that stuff on the blackboard mean?

00:35:26.87,00:35:30.00
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.

00:35:30.00,00:35:32.08
I'll bet he's the only one[br]that knows the answer.

00:35:32.08,00:35:36.24
He doesn't know the answer.[br]And he'll never get it that way.

00:35:39.35,00:35:42.47
We probably couldn't get to see him[br]even if he was home.

00:35:47.69,00:35:49.76
Hey, where are you going?

00:35:49.76,00:35:53.93
If he's that difficult to see,[br]perhaps we ought to leave a calling card.

00:36:08.49,00:36:10.56
Did he do it wrong?

00:36:10.56,00:36:12.65
He just needs a little help.

00:36:27.20,00:36:29.29
What are you doing in here?

00:36:32.42,00:36:34.50
How dare you write on that blackboard!

00:36:34.50,00:36:37.62
Do you realize the professor's[br]worked on that problem for weeks?

00:36:38.65,00:36:40.74
He'll solve it in no time now.

00:36:40.74,00:36:44.91
- How did you get in? What do you want?[br]- To see Professor Barnhardt.

00:36:44.91,00:36:48.03
Well, he's not here.[br]And he won't be back till this evening.

00:36:53.23,00:36:55.30
I think you'd better leave now.

00:37:02.60,00:37:04.68
Would you give this to the professor?

00:37:04.68,00:37:07.80
I think he'll want to talk to me.

00:37:20.29,00:37:23.42
I wouldn't erase that.[br]The professor needs it very badly.

00:37:56.70,00:37:58.78
- Mr. Carpenter come home yet?[br]- Yeah, he's inside.

00:37:58.78,00:38:01.90
- Tell him I'd like to see him.[br]- OK. Come on in.

00:38:07.11,00:38:09.18
- Your name Carpenter?[br]- Yes.

00:38:09.18,00:38:13.33
- Professor Barnhardt been looking for me?[br]- I've been looking for you all afternoon.

00:38:20.62,00:38:22.71
Thank you.

00:38:26.86,00:38:30.00
- It was a wonderful day.[br]- You still haven't answered my question.

00:38:30.00,00:38:36.23
You know how I feel, Tom,[br]but I just want to think it over.

00:38:36.23,00:38:41.45
Boss goes to Chicago tomorrow. If I could[br]tell him I was marrying and had dependants...

00:38:41.45,00:38:45.60
You're a good salesman,[br]but I've got to think about it.

00:38:45.60,00:38:49.77
A good insurance salesman[br]wouldn't give you time to think about it.

00:38:51.84,00:38:53.93
- Good night.[br]- Night.

00:39:02.23,00:39:04.32
- Hiya, Mom.[br]- Hello, darling.

00:39:04.32,00:39:07.45
- Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.[br]- Good evening.

00:39:07.45,00:39:10.57
- Uh, Mrs. Benson, this is Mr. Brady.[br]- How do you do?

00:39:10.57,00:39:12.65
Mr. Brady's a government agent!

00:39:15.77,00:39:18.89
- Have a nice day, dear?[br]- We had a swell time, didn't we?

00:39:18.89,00:39:19.94
Yes.

00:39:19.94,00:39:24.10
We went to the movies and had ice-cream[br]cones, and then we went to see Daddy.

00:39:25.14,00:39:28.26
- I don't know how to thank you.[br]- I enjoyed every minute of it.

00:39:29.30,00:39:31.39
We better get going, Mr. Carpenter.

00:39:32.43,00:39:35.56
Aw, gee, you didn't finish your story.

00:39:35.56,00:39:38.66
I'll finish it tomorrow. Good night, Bobby.

00:39:38.66,00:39:40.73
- Good night.[br]- Good night.

00:39:49.07,00:39:51.14
Come on, dear. Time to go to bed.

00:39:53.24,00:39:56.36
Why did Mr. Carpenter[br]have to go with Mr. Brady?

00:39:56.36,00:39:58.44
I don't know. Maybe it was a mistake.

00:39:58.44,00:40:00.52
Oh.

00:40:01.56,00:40:05.74
We sure had fun today. We saw the spaceship[br]and we went to see Professor Barnhardt.

00:40:05.74,00:40:07.81
- Professor Barnhardt?[br]- Yeah, sure.

00:40:07.81,00:40:13.00
- Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?[br]- Yes, of course, dear.

00:40:13.00,00:40:16.14
Gee. I was hoping I could[br]go out with Mr. Carpenter again.

00:40:24.46,00:40:27.56
Oh, come in. The professor's in his study.

00:40:27.56,00:40:29.66
Thank you.

00:40:37.98,00:40:41.09
This is the man you wanted to see, Professor.

00:40:41.09,00:40:43.18
- Thank you, Captain.[br]- I'll wait outside.

00:40:45.26,00:40:49.43
- You wrote this?[br]- It was a clumsy way to introduce myself.

00:40:49.43,00:40:52.54
But I understand you're a difficult man to see.

00:40:52.54,00:40:57.74
- I thought you'd have the solution by now.[br]- Not yet. That's why I wanted to see you.

00:40:57.74,00:41:00.87
All you have to do now is to substitute[br]this expression at this point.

00:41:00.87,00:41:06.07
That will reproduce the first-order term.[br]But what about the effect of the other terms?

00:41:06.07,00:41:10.24
Almost negligible. With variation[br]of parameters, this is the answer.

00:41:10.24,00:41:13.36
How can you be so sure?[br]Have you tested this theory?

00:41:14.39,00:41:18.56
I find it works well enough[br]to get me from one planet to another.

00:41:21.69,00:41:23.77
I am Klaatu.

00:41:24.79,00:41:30.01
I spent two days at your[br]Walter Reed Hospital, room 309.

00:41:30.01,00:41:33.12
My doctor's name was Major White.

00:41:34.17,00:41:37.30
If you’re not interested[br]or if you intend to turn me over to your army,

00:41:37.30,00:41:39.37
we needn't waste any more time.

00:41:49.78,00:41:52.89
You may go now, Captain.[br]Please thank General Cutler,

00:41:52.89,00:41:56.01
and tell him...[br]tell him that I know this gentleman.

00:41:59.15,00:42:00.17
You have faith.

00:42:00.17,00:42:04.33
It isn't faith that makes good science,[br]Mr. Klaatu. It's curiosity.

00:42:05.39,00:42:07.47
Sit down, please.

00:42:07.47,00:42:11.62
There are several thousand questions[br]I'd like to ask you.

00:42:12.66,00:42:16.82
- I'd like to explain something of my mission.[br]- That was my first question.

00:42:16.82,00:42:23.06
We know from observation that your planet[br]has discovered a rudimentary atomic energy.

00:42:23.06,00:42:28.27
- And that you're experimenting with rockets.[br]- Yes, that is true.

00:42:28.27,00:42:33.48
While you were limited to fighting among[br]yourselves with primitive tanks and aircraft,

00:42:33.48,00:42:35.57
we were unconcerned.

00:42:35.57,00:42:39.73
But soon one of your nations[br]will apply atomic energy to spaceships.

00:42:39.73,00:42:43.88
That will create a threat[br]to the peace and security of other planets.

00:42:44.92,00:42:47.00
That, of course, we cannot tolerate.

00:42:47.00,00:42:50.11
What exactly is the nature[br]of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?

00:42:50.11,00:42:53.25
I came here to warn you[br]that by threatening danger,

00:42:54.28,00:42:57.41
your planet faces danger, very grave danger.

00:42:58.44,00:43:02.60
- I'm prepared, however, to offer a solution.[br]- Would you care to be more specific?

00:43:02.60,00:43:06.77
What I have to say[br]must be said to all concerned.

00:43:06.77,00:43:10.93
It is too important[br]to be entrusted to any individual.

00:43:16.13,00:43:20.31
I gather that your efforts on[br]the official level were not successful.

00:43:20.31,00:43:25.50
I come to you as a last resort,[br]and I confess my patience is wearing thin.

00:43:25.50,00:43:29.67
- Must I take drastic action to get a hearing?[br]- What... what sort of action do you mean?

00:43:29.67,00:43:34.86
Violent action, since that seems to be[br]the only thing your people understand.

00:43:34.86,00:43:39.01
Levelling New York City perhaps,[br]or sinking the Rock of Gibraltar.

00:43:47.35,00:43:50.47
Would you meet with the group[br]of scientists I'm calling together?

00:43:50.47,00:43:55.68
You could explain your mission to them and[br]they, in turn, could present it to their peoples.

00:43:55.68,00:43:58.79
That's why I came to see you.

00:43:58.79,00:44:00.88
It is not enough to have men of science.

00:44:00.88,00:44:05.06
We scientists are too often[br]ignored or misunderstood.

00:44:05.06,00:44:09.22
We must get leaders from every field -[br]the finest minds in the world.

00:44:09.22,00:44:11.28
I leave that in your hands.

00:44:13.38,00:44:15.45
One thing, Mr. Klaatu.

00:44:15.45,00:44:20.66
Suppose this group should reject[br]your proposals. What is the alternative?

00:44:20.66,00:44:23.78
I'm afraid there is no alternative.

00:44:23.78,00:44:25.86
In such a case,[br]the planet Earth would have to be...

00:44:26.89,00:44:28.98
eliminated.

00:44:28.98,00:44:31.07
Such power exists?

00:44:32.10,00:44:34.19
I assure you, such power exists.

00:44:36.27,00:44:40.42
The people who come to the meeting[br]must be made to realize this.

00:44:40.42,00:44:42.51
They must understand what is at stake.

00:44:44.59,00:44:46.67
- You mentioned a demonstration of force.[br]- Yes.

00:44:46.67,00:44:50.83
- Would one be possible before the meeting?[br]- Yes, of course.

00:44:50.83,00:44:55.01
Something to dramatize for them and[br]their people the seriousness of the situation.

00:44:55.01,00:44:59.14
- Something to affect the entire planet.[br]- That can easily be arranged.

00:44:59.14,00:45:02.25
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody[br]or destroy anything.

00:45:02.25,00:45:05.38
Leave it to me. I'll think of something.

00:45:05.38,00:45:08.50
Maybe a little demonstration.

00:45:09.55,00:45:12.65
Something dramatic, but not destructive.

00:45:13.70,00:45:16.81
That's quite an interesting problem.

00:45:16.81,00:45:19.95
Would the day after tomorrow[br]be all right, say about noon?

00:45:29.32,00:45:31.40
There are no further developments,

00:45:31.40,00:45:36.59
but police and the FBI are tracing every[br]possible clue and rounding up all suspects...

00:45:36.59,00:45:38.68
- Rummy![br]- Oh, my.

00:45:38.68,00:45:39.72
Did it again!

00:45:40.75,00:45:43.89
- Take a hand, Mr. Carpenter?[br]- Take a... ? Oh.

00:45:43.89,00:45:47.01
No, thanks. We don't... No, thanks.

00:45:48.04,00:45:51.17
- Are you going out, dear?[br]- Yes. Tom's picking me up.

00:45:51.17,00:45:55.34
Personally, I wouldn't go out[br]after dark these days.

00:45:55.34,00:45:58.45
But then I'm not courting, am l?

00:46:02.62,00:46:03.66
Oh!

00:46:03.66,00:46:05.74
Oh, Mr. Carpenter.

00:46:11.99,00:46:15.11
Everyone seems so...

00:46:15.11,00:46:18.22
"Jittery" is the word.

00:46:19.28,00:46:22.39
Bobby's the only person I know[br]who isn't... jittery.

00:46:23.44,00:46:25.50
He has his homework to keep him occupied.

00:46:25.50,00:46:28.62
- He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.[br]- Naturally, I think so.

00:46:28.62,00:46:31.75
Warm, friendly, intelligent.

00:46:32.79,00:46:35.92
Mr. Carpenter...

00:46:35.92,00:46:40.07
This is none of my business,[br]but why did that man come here last night?

00:46:40.07,00:46:43.21
They just wanted to ask me a few questions.

00:46:43.21,00:46:47.37
Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt[br]in the afternoon. He wasn't in.

00:46:47.37,00:46:50.47
Apparently they thought[br]I was looking for secrets of some kind.

00:46:53.60,00:46:55.69
Excuse me.

00:47:04.00,00:47:06.10
- Hello.[br]- Hello. Are you ready?

00:47:07.14,00:47:09.22
- In a minute.[br]- The picture starts at 8.50.

00:47:09.22,00:47:13.37
- I was with Mr. Carpenter.[br]- I hope he won't think I'm intruding.

00:47:13.37,00:47:14.40
- Sh![br]- What...

00:47:14.40,00:47:19.62
Good evening. Excuse me,[br]I was just going up to my room.

00:47:19.62,00:47:22.72
- Good night, Mr. Carpenter.[br]- Have a good time, both of you.

00:47:23.78,00:47:24.81
Thank you.

00:47:25.85,00:47:30.03
Why don't you wait in here while[br]I get my things? Tom, that was awful.

00:47:30.03,00:47:32.11
- I'm just tired of hearing about Mr. Carpenter.[br]- Tom!

00:47:32.11,00:47:37.32
I don't like how he's attached himself to you[br]and Bobby. What do you know about him?

00:47:39.38,00:47:41.48
I'll go get my things.

00:47:56.02,00:48:00.19
All you have to remember is first find[br]the common denominator, and then divide.

00:48:00.19,00:48:03.31
Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.

00:48:04.34,00:48:06.43
- I'll say good night again.[br]- Mr. Carpenter...

00:48:06.43,00:48:08.52
I...

00:48:10.60,00:48:12.68
- Good night.[br]- Good night, Mrs. Benson.

00:48:14.75,00:48:17.89
- Bed now. You can finish that in the morning.[br]- OK.

00:48:22.05,00:48:24.13
Bobby.

00:48:25.17,00:48:29.34
I think it would be better if we didn't see[br]quite so much of Mr. Carpenter.

00:48:29.34,00:48:33.50
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend,[br]and he's awful good in arithmetic.

00:48:33.50,00:48:36.60
He even helps Professor Barnhardt.

00:48:36.60,00:48:38.69
Did you really go to see Professor Barnhardt?

00:48:38.69,00:48:41.82
Sure we did. He wasn't there,[br]but we went to see him.

00:48:41.82,00:48:44.94
And Mr. Carpenter showed him[br]how to do his arithmetic.

00:48:47.03,00:48:50.14
Mom, is something wrong[br]with Mr. Carpenter?

00:48:50.14,00:48:53.28
- What do you mean, dear?[br]- On account of last night.

00:48:53.28,00:48:57.44
You think he's a bank robber,[br]or a gangster maybe?

00:48:57.44,00:49:00.54
No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man.

00:49:01.60,00:49:04.71
I just think that he might prefer[br]to be left alone, that's all.

00:49:04.71,00:49:07.84
Now you go to bed and forget about it.

00:49:07.84,00:49:09.93
- Good night, darling.[br]- Good night.

00:49:10.96,00:49:13.04
Mom?

00:49:15.13,00:49:17.21
Why would he wanna be left alone?

00:49:18.25,00:49:20.33
Don't forget to brush your teeth.

00:49:48.41,00:49:50.49
- Bobby, have you a flashlight?[br]- Yeah.

00:49:54.65,00:49:56.72
- It's a real Boy Scout one.[br]- Fine.

00:49:59.86,00:50:02.98
- Here. All you gotta do is push up on it.[br]- Oh.

00:50:02.98,00:50:06.09
- What do you need it for?[br]- I've, uh... The light in my room went out.

00:50:06.09,00:50:07.15
Oh.

00:50:08.18,00:50:12.34
I must tell you sometime about[br]a kind of train that doesn't need any tracks.

00:50:12.34,00:50:13.38
- Really?[br]- Really.

00:50:13.38,00:50:16.49
- Remind me in the morning to tell you.[br]- OK.

00:50:27.95,00:50:30.04
No tracks.

00:54:34.55,00:54:36.63
Gort! Baringa!

00:56:35.25,00:56:37.33
Come in for a minute.

00:56:38.37,00:56:42.55
- Bobby, what are you doing up?[br]- I couldn't sleep. I had to tell you.

00:56:42.55,00:56:45.65
- Tell me what?[br]- After you left, I followed Mr. Carpenter,

00:56:45.65,00:56:48.78
and where do you think he went?[br]Right into the spaceship!

00:56:48.78,00:56:51.90
- Now, Bobby, wait a minute.[br]- Honest, Mom. I saw him.

00:56:52.95,00:56:57.09
It opened up and he walked in.[br]That big iron fella was walking around, too.

00:56:57.09,00:57:00.21
- Bobby, you've been dreaming again.[br]- No, I haven't, Mom.

00:57:00.21,00:57:03.35
Honest. I promise you, I saw him!

00:57:03.35,00:57:06.48
- Where'd you see all this?[br]- On the lawn down at the Mall.

00:57:06.48,00:57:10.64
- In that place with the soldiers out in front.[br]- Where were the soldiers?

00:57:10.64,00:57:13.74
That big iron guy grabbed 'em[br]and knocked 'em out.

00:57:13.74,00:57:16.88
I like Mr. Carpenter, Mom,[br]but I'm kinda scared.

00:57:16.88,00:57:21.04
Don't be frightened. It was only a bad dream.[br]Here, we'll prove it to you.

00:57:21.04,00:57:24.15
- Tom, ask Mr. Carpenter to come down.[br]- Sure.

00:57:24.15,00:57:27.27
- He's in the room next to mine.[br]- OK.

00:57:27.27,00:57:32.49
Think back. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at[br]all, did you? You haven't even been outside.

00:57:32.49,00:57:34.57
- Yes, I have![br]- You didn't really see a spaceship,

00:57:35.61,00:57:38.72
- but you thought you did.[br]- I'd never call you a liar.

00:58:27.62,00:58:30.75
He's not there,[br]but look what I found in his room.

00:58:30.75,00:58:33.86
- Is it real?[br]- It looks real to me.

00:58:33.86,00:58:38.03
Mr. Carpenter's got lots of diamonds.[br]He gave me a couple of 'em.

00:58:39.07,00:58:41.16
- He gave these to you?[br]- Well, not exactly.

00:58:41.16,00:58:44.27
I gave him two dollars.

00:58:44.27,00:58:47.40
This doesn't make sense.

00:58:47.40,00:58:52.61
- I think he's a crook. I never did trust him.[br]- Gee, you think he's a diamond smuggler?

00:58:52.61,00:58:54.69
- You're going to bed now.[br]- I wonder if we...

00:58:55.71,00:58:58.85
Bobby and I have had[br]enough excitement for tonight.

00:58:58.85,00:59:03.01
- Do you think it's all right to stay here?[br]- I've got a good lock on my door.

00:59:03.01,00:59:07.16
Bobby's gonna sleep in my room tonight.[br]Come on now, up to bed with you.

00:59:07.16,00:59:09.26
Bobby, your shoes are soaking!

00:59:09.26,00:59:11.33
Yeah. The grass was kinda wet.

00:59:19.66,00:59:21.75
- I'm going now, Helen.[br]- All right.

00:59:35.27,00:59:37.36
- Hello.[br]- May I see you for a minute?

00:59:37.36,00:59:40.49
- Well, I'm just going to lunch.[br]- May I walk out with you?

00:59:41.53,00:59:43.60
- Well...

00:59:47.75,00:59:49.83
Mrs. Benson speaking.

00:59:49.83,00:59:50.88
Oh, hello.

00:59:50.88,00:59:55.03
I'm getting an appraisal on that diamond.[br]Can we lunch together?

00:59:55.03,00:59:58.14
Can I talk to you later?

00:59:58.14,01:00:00.22
Oh, that'll be fine. Bye.

01:00:12.72,01:00:14.80
I saw Bobby this morning[br]before he went to school.

01:00:14.80,01:00:17.91
- Yes?[br]- I'd like to know what he told you last night.

01:00:17.91,01:00:22.08
I really didn't pay much attention.[br]Bobby has such an active imagination.

01:00:22.08,01:00:25.20
Did you believe what he told you?

01:00:25.20,01:00:29.37
I have a reason for asking this.[br]A very important reason.

01:00:31.46,01:00:34.59
There's another elevator we can use.

01:00:44.97,01:00:49.13
- What is it you want?[br]- Before I ask you to be honest with me,

01:00:49.13,01:00:53.30
perhaps I should be[br]completely honest with you.

01:00:53.30,01:00:55.38
- What happened?[br]- What time is it?

01:00:58.50,01:00:59.54
Just 12.00.

01:00:59.54,01:01:03.69
We shall be here for a little while.[br]About 30 minutes.

01:01:05.78,01:01:08.91
- We can try pushing the other buttons.[br]- They won't work.

01:01:09.95,01:01:14.09
- Why not?[br]- You see, the electricity's been neutralized...

01:01:14.09,01:01:16.18
all over the world.

01:01:17.24,01:01:20.37
Bobby was telling the truth, wasn't he?

01:01:20.37,01:01:22.43
Yes.

01:01:50.53,01:01:52.61
It's that spaceman. That's what it is.

01:03:01.28,01:03:04.40
You should see it![br]You should go out and see it for yourself!

01:03:04.40,01:03:06.49
Thanks. I am enjoying it right here.

01:03:06.49,01:03:09.60
The city has stopped.[br]People are running around like ants.

01:03:09.60,01:03:13.75
What a brilliant idea.[br]I never would have thought of it.

01:03:13.75,01:03:17.93
The people who are coming to[br]the meeting tonight, have they arrived?

01:03:17.93,01:03:22.09
Yes. I talked to them on the phone.[br]They're all very curious about the meeting.

01:03:22.09,01:03:25.20
Good. Did you speak to[br]our friend Mr. Carpenter?

01:03:25.20,01:03:27.29
He'll be there at 8.30.

01:03:28.35,01:03:33.53
Tell me, Hilda, does all this frighten you?[br]Does it make you feel insecure?

01:03:33.53,01:03:37.70
- Yes, sir. It certainly does.[br]- That's good, Hilda.

01:03:37.70,01:03:39.78
I'm glad.

01:03:40.82,01:03:44.98
As far as we can tell, power's been cut off[br]everywhere, with a few exceptions.

01:03:44.98,01:03:50.20
And even these exceptions are remarkable -[br]hospitals, planes in flight, that sort of thing.

01:03:50.20,01:03:54.36
I wish I could tell you more but,[br]as you know, all communications are out -

01:03:54.36,01:03:57.47
telephones, radio, cable, everything.

01:04:00.60,01:04:04.76
I can tell you the president is prepared[br]to declare a state of national emergency.

01:04:13.08,01:04:18.29
- Eleanor, did you call the electrician?[br]- I tried, but the phone doesn't work either.

01:04:18.29,01:04:22.46
- Well, call the phone company.[br]- But the phone doesn't work!

01:04:25.56,01:04:29.73
- Is it worth anything?[br]- I have never seen such a stone in all my life.

01:04:29.73,01:04:32.86
- Will you tell me where it came from?[br]- That's what I want you to tell me.

01:04:32.86,01:04:37.01
But there are no diamonds like this[br]anyplace in the world that I know of.

01:04:37.01,01:04:40.14
- Are you sure of that?[br]- Uh, would you like to sell it?

01:04:40.14,01:04:43.27
No. No, thanks.

01:04:43.27,01:04:46.38
- I'd give you a very good price.[br]- Thank you, no.

01:04:48.46,01:04:53.66
I've told you more than I told Barnhardt[br]because, in a sense, my life is in your hands.

01:04:53.66,01:04:59.91
I thought if you knew the facts, you'd see[br]the importance of the meeting tonight.

01:04:59.91,01:05:03.02
Of course. Of course I do.

01:05:04.08,01:05:08.25
- You hold great hope for this meeting.[br]- I can see no other hope for your planet.

01:05:08.25,01:05:12.39
If this meeting should fail,[br]then I'm afraid there is no hope.

01:05:13.42,01:05:16.56
It must be 12.30.

01:05:18.64,01:05:19.68
Yes.

01:05:20.71,01:05:22.79
Just exactly.

01:05:43.60,01:05:45.69
- Where are you going now?[br]- The boarding house.

01:05:45.69,01:05:49.85
I'll be safe there for today. I can watch Bobby.[br]He's the only other person who knows...

01:05:50.89,01:05:52.98
- No, wait. There's someone else.[br]- Who?

01:05:52.98,01:05:56.08
Tom. He was there last night[br]when Bobby told me what he saw.

01:05:56.08,01:06:01.29
- Do you think he'd tell anyone?[br]- I think he'd talk to me first anyway, before...

01:06:02.34,01:06:07.53
Well, we can't take any chance. I'll get[br]in touch with him right away to make sure.

01:06:09.62,01:06:13.78
But I've got to talk to him. It's important.[br]When is he coming back?

01:06:13.78,01:06:15.85
I don't know, Mrs. Benson.

01:06:15.85,01:06:18.99
He left before noon,[br]before that awful electric business.

01:06:18.99,01:06:22.11
I'm scared to death, Mrs. Benson. I...

01:06:22.11,01:06:26.27
No, he wouldn't tell me where he was going.[br]He said it was something personal.

01:06:26.27,01:06:29.41
Well, please ask him to call me[br]the minute he gets in.

01:06:29.41,01:06:31.47
Thanks.

01:06:34.60,01:06:39.79
Before we discuss plans, I want a report[br]from Colonel Ryder. What about the robot?

01:06:39.79,01:06:41.88
When it was discovered[br]that the robot had moved,

01:06:42.93,01:06:46.05
I was directed by the Joint Chiefs[br]to find a means of immobilizing him.

01:06:46.05,01:06:51.25
We accomplished that this morning[br]by encasing him in a block of KL93,

01:06:51.25,01:06:53.34
a new plastic material stronger than steel.

01:06:53.34,01:06:57.49
- Isn't it possible he's broken out?[br]- No, sir. We just checked on that.

01:06:57.49,01:07:01.65
- He's locked up tight as a drum.[br]- All right. Now we concentrate on the man.

01:07:01.65,01:07:05.82
Up till now we've agreed upon[br]the desirability of capturing this man alive.

01:07:05.82,01:07:08.93
We can no longer afford to be so particular.

01:07:08.93,01:07:12.05
We'll get him, alive if possible,[br]but we must get him.

01:07:13.10,01:07:15.19
- Is that clear?[br]- Yes, sir.

01:07:51.57,01:07:53.66
Honest, Mary, I'm so scared I can't sit still.

01:07:53.66,01:07:58.87
I'd like to run someplace,[br]but I don't know where to go. Bye now.

01:07:58.87,01:08:03.02
Margaret, call the Pentagon. Find out[br]who's in charge of this spaceman business.

01:08:03.02,01:08:08.24
- Whoever it is, I wanna talk to him.[br]- Mrs. Benson called. She says it's important.

01:08:08.24,01:08:10.31
Get this other call first.

01:08:14.47,01:08:17.60
- Oh, Mrs. Benson, he just walked in.[br]- Fine.

01:08:17.60,01:08:19.68
- Are you nervous, too?[br]- Yes, I am.

01:08:19.68,01:08:23.84
- Helen, come on in.[br]- I've been trying to get you all afternoon.

01:08:23.84,01:08:26.95
I have some terrific news about Mr. Carpenter.

01:08:28.03,01:08:30.09
- What about him?[br]- He's the spaceman.

01:08:30.09,01:08:34.25
I had that diamond checked at three places.[br]Nobody's ever seen a stone like that.

01:08:34.25,01:08:37.36
After what Bobby told us,[br]that's enough for me.

01:08:37.36,01:08:40.51
Why is it nobody knows about him?[br]Why hasn't he got money?

01:08:40.51,01:08:43.62
All right, Tom, it's true. I know it's true.

01:08:43.62,01:08:46.73
- You... How do you know?[br]- Never mind about that.

01:08:46.73,01:08:49.86
- Promise you won't say a word to anybody.[br]- After what happened today?!

01:08:49.86,01:08:54.02
- You don't realize how important this is.[br]- Of course it's important.

01:08:54.02,01:08:59.21
- And we can do something about it.[br]- That's what I'm saying. We must do nothing.

01:08:59.21,01:09:02.34
- Believe me.[br]- He's a menace. It's our duty to turn him in.

01:09:02.34,01:09:05.46
But he isn't a menace.[br]He told me why he came here.

01:09:06.51,01:09:08.59
He told... He told you?

01:09:08.59,01:09:12.75
Oh, don't be silly, honey,[br]just because you like the guy.

01:09:12.75,01:09:14.83
You realize what this'd mean to us?

01:09:14.83,01:09:20.04
- I'd be the biggest man in the country.[br]- Is that what you're thinking about?

01:09:20.04,01:09:22.13
- Somebody has to get rid of him.

01:09:22.13,01:09:23.15
I won't let you do it.

01:09:23.15,01:09:25.24
- Yes?[br]- This is important...

01:09:25.24,01:09:30.45
What's his name, Margaret?[br]General Cutler. Yes. Oh, all right, I'll hold on.

01:09:30.45,01:09:34.60
You mustn't. It isn’t just you and Mr.[br]Carpenter. The rest of the world is involved.

01:09:34.60,01:09:37.72
I don't care about the rest of the world.

01:09:39.78,01:09:42.91
You'll feel different[br]when you see my picture in the papers.

01:09:42.91,01:09:47.08
- I feel different now.[br]- You wait. You're gonna marry a big hero.

01:09:47.08,01:09:51.23
- I'm not going to marry anybody.[br]- Helen, l... Hello, General Cutler?

01:09:51.23,01:09:55.41
No, I don't want to speak to his aide.[br]I want to speak to the general.

01:09:55.41,01:09:57.50
Tell him it's about the spaceman.

01:10:06.86,01:10:08.95
That's right. That's where he's staying.

01:10:08.95,01:10:12.06
- Yes, of course I'm sure.[br]- Thank you, Mr. Stevens.

01:10:12.06,01:10:15.17
I'll want to talk to you further,[br]but I haven't time now.

01:10:15.17,01:10:19.35
Deploy all Zone Five units[br]according to Plan B. Immediately!

01:11:07.20,01:11:09.28
- Hello, Mrs. Benson.[br]- Hello, Sammy.

01:11:18.66,01:11:21.78
Attention, all units. Attention, all units.

01:11:21.78,01:11:24.90
When deployed according to Plan Baker,

01:11:24.90,01:11:29.06
maintain station and remain on radio alert[br]until further orders.

01:12:20.04,01:12:23.15
I'm sure Barnhardt can hide me[br]until the meeting.

01:12:23.15,01:12:26.29
- Where's the meeting going to be?[br]- At the ship.

01:12:28.37,01:12:31.48
Yeah, they got in a taxicab[br]and went off down that street.

01:12:31.48,01:12:33.56
Thank you, son.

01:12:35.64,01:12:38.77
Attention, Zone Five. Attention, Zone Five.

01:12:38.77,01:12:42.94
Yellow cab moving north[br]on 14th Street from Harvard Street.

01:12:42.94,01:12:46.06
Man and woman in back seat.[br]Get license number and report.

01:12:55.41,01:12:56.47
That's the one!

01:13:00.63,01:13:06.87
Right. Attention, Zone Five.[br]License number of target vehicle is H0012.

01:13:06.87,01:13:10.01
Hey. Looks like something big's going on.

01:13:20.41,01:13:25.58
Attention, Zone Five. Report when[br]target vehicle passes your position.

01:13:42.26,01:13:46.41
- It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.[br]- I'm worried about Gort.

01:13:46.41,01:13:49.52
I'm afraid of what he might do[br]if anything should happen to me.

01:13:49.52,01:13:53.71
Gort? But he's a robot.[br]Without you, what could he do?

01:13:53.71,01:13:55.79
There's no limit to what he could do.

01:13:55.79,01:13:57.86
He could destroy the Earth.

01:14:00.97,01:14:04.11
If anything should happen to me,[br]you must go to Gort.

01:14:04.11,01:14:06.19
You must say these words:

01:14:06.19,01:14:10.34
Klaatu barada nikto.

01:14:10.34,01:14:12.41
Please repeat that.

01:14:12.41,01:14:14.51
Klaatu...

01:14:15.53,01:14:17.63
barada nikto.

01:14:17.63,01:14:19.70
You must remember those words.

01:14:21.79,01:14:23.87
Klaatu

01:14:23.87,01:14:25.96
barada

01:14:25.96,01:14:26.99
nikto.

01:14:30.12,01:14:35.31
Yellow cab, license number H0012, heading[br]west on 15th Street at Treasury Place.

01:14:41.56,01:14:45.73
The target vehicle is turning west[br]into Massachusetts Avenue.

01:14:48.84,01:14:50.92
Yellow cab at[br]Columbia Road and Connecticut.

01:14:50.92,01:14:54.03
Repeat, Columbia Road and Connecticut.

01:14:55.07,01:14:58.19
Attention, all units,[br]northwest area, Zone Five.

01:14:59.23,01:15:04.44
Block off all streets intersecting Connecticut[br]Avenue on a line from Wisconsin to the park.

01:15:04.44,01:15:06.52
All vehicles close in.

01:15:07.56,01:15:09.64
Let's go.

01:15:46.06,01:15:48.14
Say, what's going on here?

01:15:50.23,01:15:52.32
Drive...

01:16:06.88,01:16:10.00
Get that message to Gort... right away.

01:16:32.88,01:16:36.00
- Captain, hold these people back.[br]- Yes, sir.

01:16:36.00,01:16:40.17
See if they have a stretcher[br]at the police station. Take him there.

01:19:24.56,01:19:25.60
Gort.

01:19:25.60,01:19:29.78
Klaatu barada nikto.

01:19:30.81,01:19:33.94
Klaatu barada nikto.

01:21:46.09,01:21:50.25
Yes, sir. Yes, we have the body[br]here now, locked in a cell.

01:21:51.28,01:21:54.41
There's no question about it, General.[br]He's dead all right.

01:21:54.41,01:21:58.58
I understand. I'll be right there, sir.

01:21:58.58,01:22:01.69
Bring in a squad of men.[br]Place a guard around that cell.

01:22:01.69,01:22:04.82
- Captain, don't let anyone in or out of here.[br]- Yes, sir.

01:22:04.82,01:22:06.90
Come along.

01:24:08.63,01:24:10.71
- Professor Barnhardt?[br]- Yes.

01:24:10.71,01:24:13.83
I'm very sorry, but I have to ask you[br]to call off this meeting.

01:24:13.83,01:24:15.92
Call it off?[br]But I had permission from the army.

01:24:16.96,01:24:22.16
I know, sir, but the robot's on the loose, and[br]it's not safe. You have to get your people out.

01:25:56.84,01:25:58.93
Hello.

01:25:58.93,01:26:01.00
I...

01:26:01.00,01:26:03.08
I thought you were...

01:26:03.08,01:26:05.18
I was.

01:26:07.27,01:26:09.34
You mean...

01:26:10.37,01:26:12.45
he has the power of life and death?

01:26:12.45,01:26:16.62
No. That power is reserved[br]to the Almighty Spirit.

01:26:16.62,01:26:20.78
This technique, in some cases,[br]can restore life for a limited period.

01:26:20.78,01:26:22.86
But... how long?

01:26:22.86,01:26:24.93
You mean, how long will I live?

01:26:24.93,01:26:28.08
That, no one can tell.

01:26:41.61,01:26:47.85
Under the circumstances,[br]the army people have asked us to leave.

01:26:47.85,01:26:52.00
And, since their concern is for our safety,

01:26:52.00,01:26:56.16
I can do nothing but suggest that we comply.

01:27:29.46,01:27:33.63
I am leaving soon,[br]and you will forgive me if I speak bluntly.

01:27:35.71,01:27:38.81
The universe grows smaller every day,

01:27:38.81,01:27:44.02
and the threat of aggression by any group[br]anywhere can no longer be tolerated.

01:27:46.10,01:27:50.26
There must be security for all,[br]or no one is secure.

01:27:51.31,01:27:56.50
This does not mean giving up any freedom,[br]except the freedom to act irresponsibly.

01:27:58.59,01:28:02.75
Your ancestors knew this[br]when they made laws to govern themselves,

01:28:02.75,01:28:05.89
and hired policemen to enforce them.

01:28:05.89,01:28:10.04
We of the other planets[br]have long accepted this principle.

01:28:10.04,01:28:15.25
We have an organization for[br]the mutual protection of all planets,

01:28:15.25,01:28:18.37
and for the complete[br]elimination of aggression.

01:28:18.37,01:28:24.59
The test of any such higher authority[br]is, of course, the police force that supports it.

01:28:24.59,01:28:28.76
For our policemen,[br]we created a race of robots.

01:28:29.82,01:28:34.99
Their function is to patrol the planets[br]in spaceships like this one,

01:28:34.99,01:28:37.09
and preserve the peace.

01:28:37.09,01:28:42.29
In matters of aggression[br]we have given them absolute power over us.

01:28:42.29,01:28:45.41
This power cannot be revoked.

01:28:45.41,01:28:50.61
At the first sign of violence,[br]they act automatically against the aggressor.

01:28:50.61,01:28:55.82
The penalty for provoking their action[br]is too terrible to risk.

01:28:56.86,01:28:58.94
The result is, we live in peace,

01:28:59.99,01:29:02.06
without arms or armies,

01:29:02.06,01:29:05.19
secure in the knowledge that[br]we are free from aggression and war,

01:29:05.19,01:29:08.32
free to pursue more profitable enterprises.

01:29:10.40,01:29:13.51
We do not pretend[br]to have achieved perfection,

01:29:13.51,01:29:17.67
but we do have a system, and it works.

01:29:18.73,01:29:21.84
I came here to give you these facts.

01:29:22.88,01:29:25.99
It is no concern of ours[br]how you run your own planet.

01:29:25.99,01:29:30.17
But if you threaten to extend your violence,

01:29:30.17,01:29:34.32
this Earth of yours[br]will be reduced to a burned-out cinder.

01:29:36.40,01:29:39.53
Your choice is simple.

01:29:39.53,01:29:42.66
Join us and live in peace,

01:29:42.66,01:29:45.78
or pursue your present course[br]and face obliteration.

01:29:47.85,01:29:51.00
We shall be waiting for your answer.

01:29:51.00,01:29:54.08
The decision rests with you.
