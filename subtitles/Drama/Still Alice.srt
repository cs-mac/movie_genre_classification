1
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,777
Okay. Happy birthday, Mom.

2
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,446
Oh, is that for me?

3
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,573
You don't look 40, much less 50.

4
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:35,284
Charlie, please.
But thank you. I appreciate it.

5
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:37,536
- Can I open this now?
- Yes, open it.

6
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,580
Oh, my goodness.

7
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:43,375
Oh. Oh, I love it.

8
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,002
Do you like it? Oh, good.

9
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,336
It's so beautiful.

10
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,630
You can exchange it.
I'm not going to.

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,091
- You always get me things I love.
- Good.

12
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:54,428
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, hey. Hey, isn't Lisa coming?

13
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,055
No. We split up.

14
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:59,433
Yes, I did notice your status
popped up to single, yet again.

15
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,937
I, uh, forgot your present.
I left it in my locker.

16
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,940
That's okay.
I hope you didn't spend too much.

17
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,943
- No, don't worry. He didn't.
- Where have you been?

18
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,322
The ER was like a madhouse.
One guy came in, six stab wounds.

19
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:17,076
One missed his heart by an inch.
No. Tom, it's dinnertime. Please.

20
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,161
- Not yet it isn't.
- Nearly.

21
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:23,165
What kind of antibiotic did you give him?
Mom, have you spoken to Lydia?

22
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:27,169
She wanted to be here,
but she had a really important audition.

23
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:30,923
What for?
A guest spot on some TV thing.

24
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,759
Something Enemy.
Maybe this'll be her big break.

25
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:37,137
Mm-hm. Yeah, maybe.
Don't hold your breath.

26
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,932
Heh, heh. Stop it.

27
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:44,103
You guys must have been something
growing up. Dolls with heads cut off.

28
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,396
No, my sister and I were very close.

29
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,483
Oh, no. I'm sorry,
I was talking about Anna and Lydia.

30
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,486
Oh. My goodness.
I don't know why I said that.

31
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:55,739
We're here to celebrate you,
Mom. Dad, what about a toast?

32
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,407
Dad.

33
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,284
Toast.
Oh.

34
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,120
Yes, yes, yes.

35
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:05,541
To the most beautiful
and the most intelligent woman

36
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,378
I have known in my entire life.
Thank you.

37
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,964
- Happy birthday.
- Cheers! Happy birthday!

38
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,507
We love you.
I love you.

39
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,175
Cheers.
Cheers, darling.

40
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,936
My name is Frederick Johnson.

41
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,148
I'm associate professor
of cognitive science here at UCLA.

42
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:32,651
I'm here to welcome our speaker
who just flew in from New York.

43
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:36,363
Now, in my dissertation,
I spent about a chapter and a half

44
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:40,576
vituperatively citing today's guest
and saying why she was wrong.

45
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:46,790
For the record, every time that Alice
and I have argued, she was right.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,252
Alice Howland is the Lillian Young
Professor of Linguistics

47
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:54,089
at Columbia University. She famously
wrote her seminal textbook

48
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,134
From Neurons to Nouns,
while raising three children.

49
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,803
I'm getting more
than a few "aha" moments from them.

50
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,140
And it is now considered
one of the cornerstones

51
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,851
of linguistics education
all over the world.

52
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,189
Please welcome Dr. Alice Howland.

53
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,653
Thank you so much.

54
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:21,742
Most children speak
and understand their mother tongue

55
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:25,204
before the age of 4,
without lessons, homework,

56
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,331
or much in the way of feedback.

57
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,374
How do they accomplish this feat?

58
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:34,338
This is a question that has interested
scientists at least since Charles Darwin

59
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,841
kept a diary of the early language
of his infant son.

60
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,261
He observed, "Man has
an instinctive tendency to speak

61
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,264
as we see in the babble
of young children. "

62
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,516
Much has been learned since then.

63
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:50,687
But today I'd like to focus
on some recent studies from my lab

64
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:54,608
on the acquisition of past-tense
irregular verb forms in children

65
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,861
between the ages of 18 months
and two and a half years.

66
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,155
Now, you may say that this falls

67
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,367
into the academic tradition
of knowing more and more

68
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,703
about less and less
until we know everything about nothing.

69
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:10,624
But I hope to convince you
that by observing these baby steps

70
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,501
into the...

71
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,423
Into, uh...

72
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,720
I- I knew I shouldn't have had
that champagne.

73
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:30,477
Into the word stock
of a given language,

74
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,813
we will learn crucial information

75
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:36,108
about the relationship
between memory and computation

76
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:40,570
that is the very essence
of communication.

77
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,288
Lexicon.

78
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,907
I had that same
thought. Makes sense.

79
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,618
- I saw it.
- Yeah, I thought about that.

80
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,377
Okay. I'm gonna go down
and get Shel. I'll be right back.

81
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,881
Hey.
Hi.

82
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,424
Hey, no, I'm sorry.

83
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,634
You just caught me by surprise.

84
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,136
Come on in. It's, um-

85
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:50,265
It's messy, but, you know,
I was in the process of cleaning.

86
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,059
It's fine, honey. Don't worry.

87
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:55,854
The boys are total slobs.
The kitchen is the main battleground,

88
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,441
but I've got them in training,
so we’ll see how that goes.

89
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,903
So where are they?
Working.

90
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,989
Doug's at Starbucks,
Malcolm does some catering.

91
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,950
I guess that's what they mean
by working actor, huh?

92
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:14,539
You involved with either one?
Uh, Doug's gay.

93
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:18,710
And Malcolm and I did have a thing,
but it's over.

94
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,172
He got me in with Open Space.

95
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,300
It's, like, the best theater company.
Yes, I heard.

96
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,929
Oh, thank you. Yeah, I'm done.

97
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,935
It would have been awesome
if you saw No Exit.

98
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:38,980
Daddy said you were good.
I was all right. It wasn't my best night,

99
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,359
but at least he could get,
you know, like, a sense of it.

100
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,986
Figure out why he's doing,

101
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,823
you know,
me a solid with the company.

102
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,783
What do you mean?

103
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:54,371
Um, it's really nice of him to help out.
How is he helping with the company?

104
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,332
It's our responsibility
as members to raise equity

105
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,669
for the productions we put on.
Eventually we get a cut

106
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:03,505
of the box office.
We're sort of shareholders.

107
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,799
So basically you have to pay to act?

108
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,009
No. Um...

109
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,556
It's a theater group.
It's just the reality of the situation.

110
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,724
That's how it is. It's Los Angeles.

111
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,519
Don't you think it's time
you reconsidered things?

112
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:21,440
You're so smart. There's much more
you could be doing with your life.

113
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,359
Like going to college?
Yes. Yes. Like college.

114
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:28,697
Like we've never talked about that
before. Every single day of my life.

115
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,452
I figured out what I wanted to do,
and I'm doing it. It's a good thing.

116
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,621
But on whose dime?
You're helping Tom with med school.

117
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:41,376
You helped Anna with law school.
Sweetheart, those are real careers.

118
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,879
I just don't want you
to limit your choices.

119
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,591
You want to make my choices.
No, I don't.

120
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,721
I'm really happy.

121
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,224
I'm sorry. I don't...

122
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,478
I don't wanna argue about this.

123
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,939
Just forget I said anything, okay?
It's forgotten.

124
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,818
Gonna check your phone?
It's just a game.

125
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:10,071
Your sister and I have an obsession
with "Words with Friends. "

126
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,741
That's cute.
You don't wanna play with her,

127
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,619
she's a demon.
I'm not surprised.

128
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,184
John?

129
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,356
Hi.

130
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,446
John?

131
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,545
Want one? Here you go.

132
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,590
Two for one
at the Shoe Warehouse.

133
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,551
Two for one,
Shoe Warehouse.

134
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,387
Two for one at the Shoe Warehouse.

135
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:49,606
So
- I don't know. That's all he said.

136
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,569
Two for one at the
Shoe Warehouse. Here you go.

137
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,119
One?
No, thanks.

138
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,580
Ali?

139
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,835
I was wondering where you were.
Don't. I'm really sweaty.

140
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,588
Oh. How did it go?
What?

141
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,508
UCLA.
Oh, it was, uh, good.

142
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:17,842
They were, um...

143
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:21,304
They were really receptive.
I'm sure they were.

144
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,682
How was Lydia?

145
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,476
Good. You know...

146
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,813
You guys argue?
Um...

147
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:34,776
Well, we spent the whole evening
trying not to.

148
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:40,907
The news that you're bankrolling
her theater company didn't help.

149
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,076
I told you about that.
Uh-uh.

150
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,537
You didn't.
I thought I did.

151
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,540
You didn't.
You're not gonna like this either,

152
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,750
but I have things to do at the lab.

153
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,921
Maybe walk me over there right now?
No, I don't wanna go back to campus.

154
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:58,675
I just went for a run.
I really need to be home right now.

155
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,430
Are you okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I just-

156
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,932
You said we were gonna
spend the evening in.

157
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,269
I did. We will. The sooner I go,
the sooner I'll be back

158
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:12,021
and we can watch a movie.

159
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,316
I'm sorry. I'm just exhausted.

160
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,820
Get some rest.

161
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,655
Relax.

162
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,960
I started forgetting
things, little annoying things

163
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,587
like words and names.

164
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,381
And I got lost, completely lost,

165
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,716
running on campus.

166
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,510
I talked to my doctor,
she said it could be menopause.

167
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,763
Last time I'd had a period
was February.

168
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,807
But I had one again, in September,
before my birthday.

169
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,144
Are you taking any
pills, medication, supplements?

170
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:55,440
I take a multivitamin, flaxseed oil,
calcium, iron.

171
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,234
I occasionally take a sleeping pill
when I travel.

172
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,279
Have you had any head injuries?
No.

173
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:06,117
Would you consider yourself depressed
or under undue stress at the moment?

174
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,578
No. I work a lot, but I thrive on it.

175
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:12,123
How's your sleeping?
It's fine. Like, seven hours a night.

176
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,335
Now, I'm gonna ask you to remember
a name and an address.

177
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,879
I'm gonna ask you for it again later.
Okay.

178
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:21,966
John Black,
42 Washington Street, Hoboken.

179
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,385
Can you repeat that for me?
John Black,

180
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,888
42 Washington Street, Hoboken.

181
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,599
Good. How old are you?
I'm 50.

182
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,893
What's today's date?
November 26th.

183
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,270
Where are we?
We are on the third floor.

184
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,980
of New York-Presbyterian.

185
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,774
Can you spell "water" for me?

186
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,776
W-A-T-E-R.

187
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:43,738
Now can you spell it for me backwards?
R-E-T-A-W.

188
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,741
Can you tell me what you see
on these cards?

189
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,284
Pliers.

190
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,328
A ladder.

191
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,455
A sea horse.

192
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,582
A screwdriver.

193
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,293
An elephant.
Good.

194
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:01,005
Tell me about your parents.
Well, they're both dead.

195
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,968
My mother and my sister died
in a car crash when I was 18,

196
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,263
and my father died in 1999
of liver failure.

197
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,515
Hepatitis?
Cirrhosis.

198
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,100
He was an alcoholic.

199
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:15,019
And what was he like
towards the end?

200
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:18,314
Incoherent. Incontinent.

201
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,984
We didn't really see a lot of each other.

202
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:25,154
He lived in New Hampshire,
and we weren't that close.

203
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,906
Sorry.

204
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:31,578
Do you have any other siblings?
No. I only had the one.

205
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:35,790
Now, can you tell me that name and
address that I asked you to remember?

206
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,876
Um, John Black.

207
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,545
Mm-hm. And the address?

208
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,755
Uh...

209
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,466
Damn it, I forgot. Heh.

210
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,552
Was it 42 Argyle Street,

211
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:51,556
Cole Street, Washington Street,
or South Street?

212
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,057
Um...

213
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:57,270
I was distracted talking about my parents.
Can we do that again?

214
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,939
There's no need to at this time.
Okay.

215
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,651
So I'd like to do an MRI,
just to rule some things out.

216
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,111
Like what?

217
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,780
Because I think I have a brain tumor.

218
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,618
A precaution. But it will allow us
to see if there are any lesions

219
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:15,955
or any signs of a stroke. Just
find out what is going on in there.

220
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,752
Okay.
What should I do in the meantime?

221
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:24,464
Get plenty of exercise. It's always
good to get the blood pumping.

222
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,798
Drink lots of water.

223
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,217
Good hydration
is excellent for the memory.

224
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:32,138
Next time you come and see me,
bring in someone who knows you well?

225
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,516
Your husband or a close relative?

226
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,769
Heh. Sure.

227
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,182
Uh, stethoscope,

228
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,767
millennium,

229
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,727
hedgehog.

230
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,566
Okay.

231
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,151
Um...

232
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,654
Cathode.

233
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:36,619
Pomegranate.

234
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,622
Trellis.

235
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,375
Okay.

236
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,800
Hello.

237
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,176
Hi. Come on in.

238
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,012
Hey, Mom. Hi.
Hey, hi.

239
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,430
Good to see you.

240
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,640
This is Jenny.
Hello. I'm Alice.

241
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,976
I'm happy you could join us.
Thank you.

242
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,478
Of course.
Sweetheart, why don't you guys

243
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,189
go in there and get a drink,
and grab the-?

244
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,608
The cheese thing and-
Ha, ha.

245
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:08,860
- All right.
- Yeah.

246
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,820
I'm so happy you could join us.

247
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,947
I really am, Jenny.
Thank you.

248
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,241
It smells so good in here.
Beautiful.

249
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,036
Yeah.
That's how we do it.

250
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,206
Okay.

251
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,088
How many goddamn eggs?

252
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,343
Cathode, pomegranate,

253
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,596
trellis?

254
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,015
Hey, Mom.
Hi.

255
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,309
Merry Christmas.
Oh, merry Christmas.

256
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,019
How was your flight?

257
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,647
Actually, awful. This guy
coughed all over me the entire time.

258
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,858
I hope you don't get sick.
Me too.

259
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,360
Does this mean what I think it means?
Yes.

260
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,154
Bread pudding?
Your favorite.

261
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,198
- Yes.
- Mom. Merry Christmas.

262
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,699
- Hi.
- Hello.

263
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,036
Seen my latest "Words with Friends"?
I haven't had time.

264
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,370
A real zinger.
Yeah?

265
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,289
- "Jealousy" on a triple.
- Hey!

266
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,917
Don't spoil it.
Already trending on Twitter.

267
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,418
How's California?

268
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,669
Nice.
Yeah?

269
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,171
Warmer than here?

270
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,299
Yeah. Heh, heh, heh.
Definitely warmer than here.

271
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:17,136
Hey, guys,
why don't you get out of here,

272
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,388
so I can concentrate on making this.

273
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,265
Okay?

274
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,684
Where's Dad?
He's upstairs.

275
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:24,936
Can I help you?

276
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,313
No, I'm fine.
Go get a drink or something.

277
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,733
It's gonna be delicious. Yum. It will be.
Oh, I hope so.

278
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,318
I can't wait.

279
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,861
- Jenny.
- Nice to meet you.

280
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,072
Nice to meet you too.

281
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,783
- Hi, Jenny.
- How are you?

282
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,785
- Hi.
- Hi.

283
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,245
Honestly.

284
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,330
- Hey.
- Slider.

285
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,503
It's a very big decision.
We're excited.

286
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,880
The place was recommended
by friends

287
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:57,385
who've been trying for years, and they just had their first child, so
- Heh.

288
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:58,803
So we’ll see.

289
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,514
I've heard good things about Wellspring.
Good.

290
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,475
It's expensive,
but we obviously want it to work.

291
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,435
You can't be a mom already.

292
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,854
I know.

293
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,397
- Okay.
- Are you kidding?

294
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:12,733
What kind of soup, Mom?
Here we go. It's butternut squash.

295
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,778
Hi, I'm Alice.
I'm so happy you could join us.

296
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,280
Uh-

297
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,241
I'm Jenny.
It's really nice to meet you.

298
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,577
Well, I think
Yeah-

299
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,496
I deserve a glass of wine
after that, don't you?

300
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,748
You want white?
Yes. Thank you.

301
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,084
- Does everyone have a glass?
- Yes, we do.

302
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:34,297
Let's have a toast. To Christmas.

303
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,299
Merry Christmas.

304
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,177
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

305
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,846
Now, I don't see
anything abnormal in your MRI.

306
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,348
No cerebral vascular disease,

307
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,268
no evidence of strokes, no masses.
Thank God.

308
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:50,188
And your blood work came back
completely clear,

309
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:54,775
but what worries me are
the memory tests that I sent you for.

310
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:59,238
You have sporadic memory impairment
totally out of proportion to your age.

311
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:03,910
And there is evidence of decline
in your level of mental function.

312
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:07,121
I think we should do a PET scan.
It's similar to an MRI,

313
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,665
but it can pick up things
at the molecular level.

314
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:14,003
I know what a PET scan is. What
in particular would you be looking for?

315
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:19,383
I wanna see if the results are consistent
with Alzheimer's disease.

316
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,929
Now, it would be rare
for someone as young as yourself,

317
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:26,349
but you do fit the criteria.

318
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,686
Last time, I asked you
to bring a close relative.

319
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,272
I really didn't think
that would be necessary.

320
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:36,234
Okay. But next time, for sure.

321
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,860
Okay?

322
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,822
"Enhancement of endogenous levels
of endorphin

323
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:45,117
has not been shown
to reduce incidence of metastasis

324
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,078
in the distant cell sites. "

325
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,664
That's not good.
Tell me about it.

326
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,083
We've been working on this
for months.

327
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:55,169
It seems beta endorphin
doesn't significantly impact

328
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,630
the microphage activity.

329
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,049
What about the cytokines?

330
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,969
Elevated. Slightly.

331
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,555
Oh, God.
Back to square one.

332
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,688
Are we both here on the 17th?
Um...

333
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,398
I don't remember.

334
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:19,694
Phil and Diane were saying they
might come to town for the weekend.

335
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,286
How long are you going
to keep at that thing?

336
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,538
Till it's clean.

337
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,304
John.

338
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,850
John, sweetheart, wake up.

339
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,316
What time is it?
I need to talk to you.

340
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,903
I've, um-

341
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:47,448
I've got something wrong with me.

342
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,619
What are you talking about?

343
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:54,580
I've been seeing a neurologist.

344
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:57,583
You've been seeing a neurologist?
Why?

345
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:01,837
They think that it might be
early-onset Alzheimer's disease.

346
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:07,635
Ali, Ali, that doesn't make
any sense at all.

347
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,762
They don't know anything for sure.

348
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,973
But I've been doing all these tests
and I'm really scared.

349
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:17,937
Ali, that is completely insane.
I got-

350
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:21,690
I got lost while I was running
on campus a while ago. I can't-

351
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:26,112
I can't remember appointments,
words.

352
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,280
Honey,
we all have memory lapses.

353
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,991
That's a sign of getting older.
The other day

354
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:34,286
I couldn't remember
the word, um, "glucose. "

355
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,621
It's not like that.

356
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,916
It's like something just drop-
Drops out under me.

357
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,211
But there is no diagnosis yet?
No.

358
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:46,424
Okay. Well, then I think that this
is ridiculous. It's complete bullshit.

359
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:49,885
You don't have Alzheimer's.
Why won't you take me seriously?!

360
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,512
I know what I'm feeling.

361
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:55,433
I know what it's feeling, and it feels
like my brain is fucking dying.

362
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:59,353
And everything I've worked for
in my entire life is going.

363
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,105
It's all- All going.

364
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,857
No.

365
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,526
Come here.

366
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,196
Don't cry.

367
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,377
Most of them are still awaiting trial.

368
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,921
They have not been found guilty.

369
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,800
Last year, officials at Rikers reported
to the Board of Corrections

370
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,471
- that on a typical day...
- What time is your tutorial?

371
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,347
Eleven.

372
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,725
Well,
that gives you some time.

373
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:39,018
Mm-hm.

374
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:43,689
I'm gonna be a little late
because I have a departmental meeting.

375
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,734
When I come back, we can go
to dinner, have Thai food?

376
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:48,402
Yeah, okay.

377
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,158
I'm okay. I just-

378
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:58,496
Last night just got the better of me,
that's all.

379
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:03,000
Well, two things: I think it's way
too early to jump to any conclusions...

380
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,880
and whatever happens, I'm here.

381
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,301
You can clearly see in here-

382
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:16,347
The red areas are high
in beta-amyloid.

383
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:20,476
The buildup has probably been
ongoing for several years.

384
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:22,978
I'm sorry.

385
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,774
There is evidence
of high amyloid in older people

386
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:29,235
with normal cognitive function,
correct?

387
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,863
Yes, but not in someone
as young as Alice.

388
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,824
Well, at least
it would be extremely rare.

389
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:39,495
High amyloid is associated
with conditions other than Alzheimer's.

390
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,830
Unfortunately, in Alice's case,

391
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,501
this corroborates the clinical
symptoms that she is presenting.

392
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,712
Shouldn't any diagnosis be
accompanied by a genetic test?

393
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:52,383
Hold on a minute, please.
Actually, I was gonna suggest that.

394
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:55,511
In a case like this,
with the onset being so early,

395
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:00,432
we would like to check for presenilin
mutations that would be an indicator

396
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:04,812
of familial Alzheimer's disease,
which is a rarer form.

397
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,855
We can make an appointment
for you.

398
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:10,734
So this concerns my children?
Yes.

399
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:14,321
I assume that if I have the gene,

400
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,366
the odds of my passing it along
are fifty-fifty.

401
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,784
I'm afraid so.

402
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:23,455
And if they are carriers, what are the
odds of them developing the disease?

403
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:26,333
I'm afraid it's a hundred percent.

404
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:31,505
Radiology technician,
please dial extension 256.

405
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,385
The kids will all be here
for our anniversary.

406
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,346
I don't think we should tell them,
not until we have the results.

407
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:43,309
We will by then, if I go in next week.
I wanna know as soon as possible.

408
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:47,688
Where the hell is this goddamn elevator?
Here we are in a major hospital.

409
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,940
Only one elevator running?
It's okay.

410
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,611
We could've taken the stairs by now.
It doesn't matter.

411
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,198
Going down.

412
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:10,836
Well, um, everybody...

413
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,379
What's going on?

414
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:18,802
Oh, boy. Uh...
Are you guys gonna break up or...?

415
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,763
No.

416
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:26,602
No, it's nothing like that. It-
Mom, are you sick?

417
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:34,485
I have been seeing a neurologist
for the past few months

418
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:37,946
and I have Alzheimer's disease.

419
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,823
Early onset.

420
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,910
That- That doesn't make sense.
Are-? Are you sure?

421
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,829
There is no doubt.
She has the disease.

422
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,123
But at her age, it's-

423
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,334
It is rare,
but it has been confirmed.

424
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,544
- Yeah.
- You're so young, Mom.

425
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:59,551
- I don't understand that.
- I had noticed one or two things.

426
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:02,554
You didn't know Tom's girlfriend
when she came over-

427
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,474
- Lydia.
- What medications are you on?

428
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,102
Right now,
I'm on Aricept and Namenda.

429
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:09,978
They can help slow the progress?

430
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,980
Well, no.
I'm afraid not.

431
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,899
Help alleviate the symptoms,

432
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:17,069
but they can't prevent the disease.
The thing is

433
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:20,197
that the type of Alzheimer's I have

434
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:23,325
is very rare.

435
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:30,124
It's familial. It's passed on genetically.
Oh, my God.

436
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,668
We believe that
she got it from her father

437
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:36,046
and, of course, we're very worried
about the three of you.

438
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,298
Now, there is a test you can take,

439
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:43,262
but it's completely up to you
whether you wanna find out or not.

440
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:46,181
I'm sorry.

441
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,309
I'm so...

442
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:49,495
Can anyone tell me what it says
in the syllabus for today?

443
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:52,831
Phonology.

444
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,502
And can anyone tell me
what phonology is?

445
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:06,595
"Phono" is from the Greek
word "phoné, " meaning "sound,"

446
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:11,266
and phonology, broadly speaking, is
the study of the sounds of language.

447
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,811
It should be distinguished
from phonetics.

448
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,742
Hi, Anna.

449
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,285
Hi, Mom.

450
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,496
Are you okay?

451
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:36,291
I got the results. I'm positive.

452
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,378
Oh, God, Anna.

453
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:43,298
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

454
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:47,719
Tom turned out negative,
and Lydia didn't wanna know.

455
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,346
But I'm positive.

456
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,974
Baby, how are you feeling?

457
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,184
I'm okay.

458
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:59,940
One good thing, at least I found out now
before the next IUI session.

459
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,067
I guess they can test the embryos,

460
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,778
so they can be sure
the babies will be okay.

461
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:09,116
I'm on my way to a lecture, but I can
cancel it and I can be right there.

462
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:13,120
No, no, Mom, it's okay.
I'm with Charlie. I'm okay.

463
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:17,082
No, I want to. I can-
I- I want to be there. I can come.

464
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:21,253
No, please don't worry. I'll be fine.

465
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,505
Okay.

466
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,592
I love you, sweetheart.

467
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,719
I love you.

468
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,848
Bye.
Bye.

469
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:17,017
"I had been looking forward to
this course, but I was disappointed.

470
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:22,564
The content was often muddled
and delivered with little focus or care.

471
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:27,027
Class was a waste of time. I ended up
just following the online version.

472
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:30,155
I found Linguistics 201
very erratic.

473
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:34,159
I had a hard time
following Dr. Howland's lectures.

474
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,870
Even she seems
like she gets lost in them. "

475
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:43,001
Eric, I am so sorry.
I- I didn't know the students felt this way.

476
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:47,756
Obviously, I will
- I will make adjustments and we can reevaluate my performance.

477
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,634
Everything all right at home?
Between you and John?

478
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:53,971
Yes, everything’s fine.
Is it something we can help with?

479
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,973
Stress, depression?
No, no, no.

480
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,642
Substance abuse? Alcohol?
No. No. God, Eric.

481
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:01,603
No, it's- It's nothing like that.
I- It's, uh-

482
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:06,149
It's medical.
It's a- It's a medical issue,

483
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:10,070
and I admit I had a hard time
teaching last semester

484
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,656
and I wasn't aware
of how much it showed.

485
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:15,659
Alice, I'm not following.

486
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:20,247
I have mild cognitive impairment.

487
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:22,624
Would you unpack that for me?

488
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:26,670
In February, I was diagnosed
with early onset Alzheimer's disease.

489
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,256
What?

490
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:33,552
Alice, oh, my God, I'm sorry.
It's early. It's still early stages.

491
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:36,179
It will limit my ability as time goes on,

492
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:39,641
but for now, I feel capable-
There's no need to-

493
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:43,145
I mean, we don't want you
under any undue stress.

494
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:46,440
That would be counterproductive.
I can handle the stress.

495
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:51,278
I would like to remain in the department
for as long as we all think is possible.

496
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:57,367
Well, I’ll have to let the department
and the faculty know.

497
00:33:58,578 --> 00:33:59,703
Yes, of course.

498
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:02,706
I am so, so sorry.

499
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:53,465
I’ll have a regular
with blueberries and coconut, please.

500
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,314
Hi.

501
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,734
Alice, where the hell were you?

502
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,111
I went for a run.

503
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,030
You've been gone for over two hours.
I was worried.

504
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,032
Well, then I went to Pinkberry.

505
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,785
You went to Pinkberry?
Yeah.

506
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:26,665
Well, I hope you enjoyed that because
you completely blew our dinner plans.

507
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,043
Susan Kirby and her husband.

508
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:35,090
I'm sorry. I forgot.

509
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,717
I have Alzheimer's.

510
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,511
I texted you, I e-mailed you.

511
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,264
There are ways to manage-
I said I was sorry.

512
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,975
She's the chair of my department.

513
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,894
I had no idea where you were,
if something happened.

514
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:51,273
Why didn't you bring your phone?
I can't when I'm running.

515
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,817
Wear a fanny pack.
Is it that inhibiting?

516
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,527
Yes.

517
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:03,785
I hate that this is happening to me.
I hate it too.

518
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:07,664
We have to keep the important
things in our life going.

519
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,083
We have to try
or we're going to go crazy.

520
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,668
I know. I know, John.

521
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:15,964
I am, I'm sorry, but I don't know what I
would've been like at a dinner party.

522
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,551
I might not be able to remember names
or answer simple questions.

523
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,762
Never mind get through an anecdote.
You're doing great.

524
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:24,139
Relative to what?

525
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,978
I wish I had cancer.

526
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,272
Don't say that.

527
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:35,609
No, I do. I mean it.
I mean, I wouldn't feel so ashamed.

528
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:38,695
People have cancer,
they wear pink ribbons for you

529
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:42,991
and go on long walks,
and raise money,

530
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:47,954
and you don't have to feel
like some kind of a social...

531
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,459
I can't remember the word.

532
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:07,015
In 2013, we completed exterior repairs,
and inside, we replaced the elevators,

533
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,393
refurbished the auditorium,
the library and lounge area

534
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:13,521
and upgraded our HVAC system.
Well, that's good.

535
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:16,316
We also took away
a lot of the old security doors,

536
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:18,693
Residents are issued a bracelet
instead,

537
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:23,698
which keeps them from using elevators or
leaving the building, depending on their level.

538
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,201
I don't know if you've experienced
this with your parent,

539
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,621
but they get nighttime restlessness
and wandering.

540
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:33,833
We can prevent their elopement without
patients feeling they're locked in.

541
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,085
I see.

542
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:39,798
We saw that large group activities
left most of the residents unengaged

543
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:44,302
and even distressed by the confusion
they experienced from all the stimulation.

544
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,763
So we redefined activities

545
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:51,017
to include all interactions
between staff and residents in the unit.

546
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:55,313
Staff looks for opportunities to make
meaningful connections with residents,

547
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:59,943
starting with knowing about the person
and what makes them comfortable.

548
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:05,198
One woman who had worked as a nurse sat, most
days, in the nursing station, writing notes.

549
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:06,449
Heartbreaking.

550
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,661
Yes, but it's a behavior
we see time and again.

551
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,205
We don't have restrictions
on visiting times.

552
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,708
Family and friends
are welcome day or night.

553
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:17,294
Doesn't look like anybody's here.
Sunday is the day they come.

554
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,171
What's that?
Chair alarm.

555
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,465
Certain residents have them
so we know they're up.

556
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:25,093
- She all right?
- Just a precautionary measure.

557
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,929
Get me to Penn Station.
It's all women.

558
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,266
We do have mainly female residents
here, but there are men.

559
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,977
There's William.
William was part of the team

560
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:37,022
that sent the first satellite into orbit.
Mm-hm.

561
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:52,787
They just aren't powerful enough
to put me to sleep.

562
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,539
Do you want to try Lunesta?

563
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,291
What about Rohypnol?

564
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,709
That's very strong.

565
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:00,045
I need something strong.

566
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,806
Hi, Alice.

567
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:16,353
I am you and I have something
very important to say to you.

568
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:19,939
So you've reached the point
where you can no longer answer

569
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:22,150
any of the questions.

570
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,487
So this is the next logical step.

571
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,489
I'm sure of it.

572
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,533
In your bedroom there's a dresser
with a blue lamp.

573
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,827
Open the top drawer.

574
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:36,206
In the back of the drawer,
there's a bottle with pills in it.

575
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:39,292
It says, "Take all pills with water. "

576
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:42,128
Now, there are a lot of pills
in that bottle,

577
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:45,757
but it's very important
that you swallow them all.

578
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:52,263
Okay?
And then lie down and go to sleep.

579
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:55,725
And don't tell anyone
what you're doing.

580
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:34,532
Ali!

581
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,618
Ali!

582
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,211
Oh, I love it here.

583
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,213
Me too.

584
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:02,560
And if I had a boat
I'd go out on the ocean♪

585
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,902
Remember Santorini? Ha, ha, ha.
Santorini.

586
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:15,949
Can you believe that was 30 years ago?
Don't do that to me. Oh, my God.

587
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:18,368
Oh, it was a complicated time, huh?

588
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:21,412
You were dealing with a lot.
What was it, a year after?

589
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:24,207
Yeah, something like that.
Yeah.

590
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:28,711
I know I've said this, but I am sorry I
never got to meet your mom or your sister.

591
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,713
Me too.

592
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,007
We had a great time, though.

593
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:37,887
Yeah.
Don't you wish we had more of that?

594
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:41,599
If you mean blow jobs on the beach, yes.
Ha, ha, ha.

595
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,227
Yeah, but, you know.
I do wish we had more.

596
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:46,604
Yeah, all of it.

597
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:48,940
It all happened so fast, you know.

598
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:51,651
Anna was born, our careers.

599
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,486
Well, you were relentless.

600
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:56,698
You wanted evertyhing
and all at once.

601
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:00,535
That's how I am. That's how I like it.

602
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,371
Anna's the same way, right?

603
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,207
I like you the way you are.

604
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,919
I like evertyhing about you.

605
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:11,963
Thank God you do.

606
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:14,340
Mm. Mm.

607
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,261
This is so great, you know.

608
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,762
I kind of like it.

609
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,890
Being liberated from Columbia.

610
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,060
Why don't you take a sabbatical
next year?

611
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:29,314
And we're gonna do what,
drive around the country in an RV?

612
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:34,402
Sure. I don't know,
we could spend more time here.

613
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:35,653
Go to Bhutan.

614
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:39,616
Well, I think our summer on the island
is all the excitement I can handle.

615
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:42,327
Okay. Well, you know what?

616
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:46,289
This might be the last year
that I'm myself, you know?

617
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:53,921
Please don't say that.

618
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:19,280
John?

619
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,282
I'm over here.

620
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:25,370
Oh, hey, when are you
going to the conference?

621
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,206
On Monday.

622
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:31,334
And when is Lydia coming?
Lydia comes on Sunday.

623
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:34,045
She doesn't have to come
just to babysit me.

624
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,590
She's coming to do the Chekhov play
at Saugatuck, remember?

625
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,259
Right.
When I get finished,

626
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:44,013
are we gonna go for a run?
Yeah, I need to grab another layer.

627
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,640
Okay.

628
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,935
Hey, are we still going running?
Oh, I'm sorry. Hey, look.

629
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:33,521
Look, I found this photo album

630
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,982
with these pictures
of my mother and my sister.

631
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,442
Oh.

632
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,653
Hey, when are you going
to the conference?

633
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:44,073
Monday.
And when is Lydia coming?

634
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:46,409
Lydia's coming on Sunday.

635
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:48,161
Okay.

636
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,122
Are we going running?
Yes.

637
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:53,291
Yes, we are.
I just have to go pee.

638
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,168
I’ll be right back.

639
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,945
Ali?

640
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:09,617
I couldn't find the bathroom.

641
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:12,203
It's okay, baby.
Come on, let's get you cleaned up.

642
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,373
I don't know where I am.

643
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:38,646
I like that necklace.
You do?

644
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,189
Yeah.
Haven't seen this?

645
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:41,858
Nope.

646
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:44,735
My mother gave it to me.

647
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:48,072
When I was, um, a little girl,

648
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:52,118
like, in second grade,
my teacher told me

649
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:55,705
butterflies don't live a long time.
They live, like, a month.

650
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:59,667
And I was so upset, and I went home,
and I told my mother, and she said:

651
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:03,004
"Yeah, but, you know,
they have a nice life.

652
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,464
They have a really beautiful life. "

653
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:10,136
So now it always makes me think about
my mother's life, and my sister's life.

654
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:14,807
And to a certain extent,
you know, my own.

655
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,814
You are gonna be around for a long time.
Yes, yes.

656
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:24,150
There's some things I wanna do,
you know?

657
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:28,112
I wanna take a sabbatical with Daddy.
I don't think that's gonna happen.

658
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:32,867
And I wanna see Anna have a baby,
and I wanna see Tom graduate.

659
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:36,954
You will.
And I'd like to see you go to college.

660
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:43,336
Not for law or medicine or anything,
but for drama.

661
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:46,339
And if the acting thing doesn't
work out, you could-

662
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:50,718
You could teach or do workshops.
You'd have some kind of a backup plan.

663
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,595
Yeah.

664
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,848
I don't want a backup plan.

665
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:57,725
I-

666
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:02,980
I wanna do this. I'm gonna give it a shot. It's
not gonna happen if I don't believe in myself.

667
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:06,817
I believe in you, Lydia.
I do, I believe in you.

668
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:09,820
It's just that, you know,
life is tough.

669
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,949
It is tougher than you know.

670
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:14,325
And I-

671
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:18,663
I just- I want you to have
some kind of security before I go.

672
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:21,749
Mom, for God-

673
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,626
You have to-

674
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:28,506
You can't use your situation
to just get me to do everything

675
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:30,800
you want me to do.
Why can't I?

676
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:33,844
Because that's not fair.
I don't have to be fair.

677
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,930
I'm your mother.

678
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:39,392
Right?
Yeah.

679
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:22,935
Hey.
What's going on?

680
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,438
I'm just working, how about you?

681
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:28,107
Nothing.

682
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,028
I need something to read.

683
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:36,115
I thought you were reading Moby-Dick.
Yeah, I was,

684
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:41,287
but I got tired of reading the same
page over and over again. I can't focus.

685
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:44,165
Well, that happens to me
when I read Moby-Dick too.

686
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:47,877
Why don't you try something lighter.
Like The Cat in the Hat?

687
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:50,671
How about one of those plays
Lydia has downstairs?

688
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,215
They're quicker,
they're easier to read.

689
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:56,343
It might give the two of you
something to talk about.

690
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:03,642
Okay.

691
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:14,403
You work all the time.

692
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:15,172
What I liked about it was how-

693
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:18,801
How big, how-

694
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:24,014
How wide the scape of it was.

695
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,850
Yeah. The scope of it.

696
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:28,686
The scope, that's the word.
Oh, God, listen to me. Heh.

697
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:31,397
It's unbelievable you had
to live through that.

698
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:33,899
You must have known...

699
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,443
Must have known somebody
that died from AIDS.

700
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:40,114
Oh, yeah, honey. Everybody did.

701
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:43,200
We lost a lot of people.

702
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,537
What did you think?

703
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:49,707
I mean, you and Malcolm
played the Mormons, right?

704
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:53,002
The husband and wife?
You did scenes in your acting class.

705
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:55,004
Yeah, how'd you know that?

706
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,966
I don't know,
you must have told me.

707
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:02,136
I didn't tell you.
Mm...

708
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,721
Well, then...

709
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,806
I don't know how I know it.

710
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:08,934
Mom, did you read my journal?

711
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,105
Uh...

712
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,983
Why?

713
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,777
Why would you do that, Mom?
Oh, gosh.

714
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:21,572
I am so sorry.

715
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:25,326
Lydia, I honestly didn't understand
what I was reading.

716
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:28,954
You didn't understand "Lydia Howland"
written across the front?

717
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:32,249
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I-
I don't believe you.

718
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:33,959
I didn't mean to.

719
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:35,502
Okay, it's fine.

720
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:37,296
I just can't...

721
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:40,424
Lydia, I didn't- I really didn't know.
Just stop!

722
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,968
I wouldn't do that to you.

723
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,681
So you can't eat this.
No, I know.

724
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:51,810
No sushi, no hot do
- Hot dogs are the worst. I love hot dogs.

725
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,562
No alcohol.
No alcohol.

726
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,856
No cigarettes.
Never even smoked.

727
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,524
Well, you- I mean-

728
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:00,694
- Never had a cigarette in your life?
- Not one.

729
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,571
We can't be too careful.

730
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:06,867
He even grabbed my hand the other day
as we were walking down the stairs.

731
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:11,247
Protecting my investment.
Anna, return my "Words with Friends. "

732
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:14,625
Oh, I'm sorry, Mom. I haven't had time.
Oh.

733
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:15,834
- Yeah.
- Hey.

734
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:18,170
Hey, hey. Thank you.
Congrats.

735
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:22,800
There you are.
Thanks. So twins, huh?

736
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:25,594
Yes, a boy and a girl.
Kind of perfect.

737
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:28,430
What your mother and I were hoping for.
It's so wonderful.

738
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:30,933
Oh, gosh.

739
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,602
I'm sorry, I've gotta take this. Hello?

740
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:35,771
- How far along are you?
- Five weeks.

741
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:39,233
Right now, it's very early days,
but, um...

742
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:42,778
Well, the timing of things, how
we found out and when we did,

743
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:45,906
- well, it really worked out in the end.
- Great.

744
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:49,201
- That's amazing.
- So, Mom, how you feeling?

745
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,911
Mostly fine.
Really?

746
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:54,832
Yeah, I use this thing,
you know, instead of a memory.

747
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:57,710
Reminds me to take my medication,
things like that.

748
00:54:57,919 --> 00:55:00,004
It's nice how the technology can help.

749
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:04,133
I think it has the same...
Lydia, what time is your play?

750
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:05,551
Eight o'clock.

751
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,720
- Nervous about tomorrow night?
- Yes.

752
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:10,597
- I’ll be fine, but I'll have to block you out.
- Heh, heh.

753
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,516
I'm sorry. What time again?

754
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,059
Eight o'clock.
Okay.

755
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:17,980
You don't have to schedule it.
I wanna put it in. And where is it?

756
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:20,190
The Saugatuck Theater.
Can you spell that?

757
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,776
S-A-U-
Mom, we're not gonna forget you.

758
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,278
Just let her do it.

759
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:27,406
It's S-A-U-G-A-T-U-C-K.
Oh, God.

760
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:29,199
Anna, you're not helping.
You're not.

761
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:31,785
Why worry about remembering
something she doesn't have to?

762
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,954
If you just let her, she won't worry.

763
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:37,583
You don't have to talk about her
like she's not sitting here.

764
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:41,003
I'm not, I'm talking to her. Aren't I, Mom?
Yes, you are.

765
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:43,630
Yes, and what makes you an expert?
Shut up.

766
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,174
Grow up, Lydia.
Suck it.

767
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:46,717
That's very articulate.

768
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:48,344
Girls, girls, you know-

769
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:50,679
Are you kidding me?
That's enough.

770
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,931
- Stop it, please.
- You shut up.

771
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:56,018
- No, both of you, stop it.
- What is going on here?

772
00:55:57,937 --> 00:56:00,689
Alice, this is a beautiful spread.

773
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:03,359
Thank you, Charlie.

774
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:05,235
Very valuable

775
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:09,531
Lydia, baby, I know that we argued
about something yesterday,

776
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:13,077
but I can't remember
what it was about.

777
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:14,620
Oh.

778
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:17,956
It was nothing, honestly.
No, I upset you.

779
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:22,294
And I should apologize.

780
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:27,049
No, no.

781
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:28,467
I should apologize.

782
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:29,968
I'm...

783
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:34,098
I feel really bad.
I was so insensitive yesterday.

784
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,602
Will you forgive me, honestly?

785
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:41,230
But for what?

786
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:47,861
It was about you respecting my
privacy, and I don't want that.

787
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:50,948
And I take it back completely.

788
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:53,492
And I'm sorry, okay?

789
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,702
I'm sorry.

790
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:02,418
It's not as if I can remember it. Heh, heh.
Heh, heh.

791
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:06,296
Yeah, I know, right?
That's why I tried to drop it.

792
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,389
What's it like?

793
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:20,477
Like, what does it actually feel like?
Um...

794
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:24,356
Well, it's not always the same.

795
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:28,360
You know, I have, uh-
I have good days and bad days.

796
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:35,242
And on my good days, I can, you
know, almost pass for a normal person.

797
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:40,330
But on my bad days, I feel
like I can't find myself. Um...

798
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:48,714
I've always been so defined
by my intellect,

799
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:52,759
my language, my articulation,

800
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:56,972
and now, sometimes, I can see
the words hanging in front of me

801
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:59,850
and I can't reach them.
I don't know who I am,

802
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:02,603
and I don't know
what I'm gonna lose next.

803
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,277
That sounds horrible.

804
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,784
Thanks for asking.

805
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:48,315
Oh, Lydia.

806
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:52,402
They're leaving us.

807
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,530
One has quite left us.

808
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:57,241
Quite and forever.

809
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:01,161
We alone remain
to begin our lives over again.

810
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:05,374
We must live.

811
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:09,962
There will come a time
when we all will know why...

812
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:13,840
for what purpose
there is all of this suffering

813
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:18,095
and there will be no mystery.

814
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:20,138
But now we must live.

815
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:24,560
We must work, just work.

816
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:28,146
Tomorrow I'll go off on my own
and I'll teach.

817
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:32,317
I’ll give everything I have
to those who might, perhaps, need it.

818
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:36,154
It's autumn now.

819
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:40,826
Soon it will be winter.
The snow will cover everything.

820
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,745
And I'll be working.

821
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:47,791
Just working.

822
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:11,982
There she is. Hey, you were amazing.

823
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:14,318
Yes, you were so good.

824
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:18,196
- Incredible.
- You killed it, totally.

825
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:21,116
Miss Howland,
would you sign this for me?

826
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:25,704
It was just wonderful.

827
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:28,749
I- I found it so easy
to empathize with her.

828
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:33,253
You- You really caught her despair,
but also her joy.

829
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:37,299
Thank you. Awesome.

830
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:40,719
Will we get to see you in
anything else this summer?

831
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:43,639
Um, no, this is the only job I got.

832
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:46,683
Oh, so you're here
for just the season.

833
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:53,482
- Yeah.
- Mom. Mom.

834
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:56,109
This is Lydia, your daughter.

835
01:00:57,528 --> 01:01:00,530
No, I- I know that.
Heh, heh.

836
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:05,619
Thanks for coming.
Weird, embarrassing.

837
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:09,373
Don't be embarrassed.
Don't, please. Please don't be.

838
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:11,249
Giraffe.

839
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:13,502
Hammer.

840
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:17,005
Comb.

841
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:20,550
Oh, I know what that is.

842
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,345
It is like a chicken, but it's not.

843
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:27,182
It is a duck.

844
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:28,684
How about this one?

845
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:30,018
A basketball.

846
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:34,147
Can you spell water for me backwards?
Could I spell it forward first?

847
01:01:34,315 --> 01:01:35,357
Mm-hm.

848
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:41,405
W-A-T-E-R.

849
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:48,203
R- E-T-A-W.

850
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:49,579
That's very good.

851
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:52,582
Now, can you tell me that name
I asked you to remember?

852
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:56,420
Ugh. You always tell me,
and I can never remember it.

853
01:01:56,629 --> 01:02:02,342
Was it John Black, John White,
John Jones, or John Smith?

854
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:03,593
Smith?

855
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:07,180
And his address,
was it East Street, Washington Street,

856
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,808
Humboldt Street, or Main Street?

857
01:02:10,017 --> 01:02:14,312
Just to jump in here, we're both
concerned about the rate of deterioration.

858
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:18,024
Is that normal?
Well, every case is different.

859
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:21,862
With familial early onset,
things can go fast.

860
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:26,992
And with people who have a high level
of education, things can go faster.

861
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:30,328
They've managed to sustain
their mental processes

862
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:34,708
through innovative means
and that delays diagnosis.

863
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:39,421
Now, clearly, Alice's memory is failing,
but she's still incredibly resourceful.

864
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:41,006
Thank you.

865
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:43,467
I know you're- You're discouraged,

866
01:02:44,051 --> 01:02:47,137
but sometimes I've seen patients
plateau at this point.

867
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:50,098
Don't lose hope.

868
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:54,311
I read your name in the Alzheimer's
Association Care Conference brochure.

869
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:57,773
You're gonna give a speech.
Will you be there?

870
01:02:57,982 --> 01:02:59,816
Yes. I'm looking forward to it.

871
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:04,070
I'm going to be away on business
in Minnesota, and I'm worried.

872
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:07,991
Are you sure this is a good idea,
considering the state that she's in?

873
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:11,495
She's gonna be under a lot of stress.
It'll be great for her.

874
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:14,956
Everything will be fine.
But you're not worried about it,

875
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:18,210
are you, Alice?
No, I don't think so.

876
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:24,049
"Various ways to prevent
the production of amyloid

877
01:03:24,258 --> 01:03:26,134
are being tried.

878
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:29,137
There is a new study

879
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:33,850
that combines base and gamma
secretase inhibitors

880
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:38,730
and this is one of our best hopes
for the future. "

881
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,149
That's it. That's the end.

882
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:44,194
It's good, Mom. It's good.

883
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:48,114
It's very scientific.
Yes, well, you know.

884
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:52,786
Yeah. And I'm sure it's valid,
but, um...

885
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:54,538
But what?

886
01:03:54,747 --> 01:03:58,416
I mean, is there any value
in making it a bit more personal?

887
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:00,669
I don't understand what you mean.

888
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:04,714
You know, you're not speaking
to a room of scientists.

889
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:09,302
What I wanna know, really, is, like,
how you feel, what does it feel like?

890
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,680
What does this disease mean
to you?

891
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:14,474
You weren't listening
because that's all there.

892
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:16,142
That's in the speech.

893
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:17,727
Okay.

894
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:22,941
Don't ask me, then.
Oh, no, then I won't ask, then.

895
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,114
Hey.

896
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:32,576
Mom, just give it
one more shot, okay?

897
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:35,954
I can't
because I have done it already.

898
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:37,455
Huh?

899
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:41,251
I- I use this...

900
01:04:42,169 --> 01:04:44,921
Yellow- Yellow thingy to mark it,

901
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:51,678
so I don't have to read the same line
over and over and over and over again.

902
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,054
Got it. Totally.

903
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:55,307
Just print out one more.

904
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:57,434
It took me three days to write this.

905
01:04:57,643 --> 01:05:01,354
You can print out one more.
No, it took me three days.

906
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:03,690
Sorry.
Three days.

907
01:05:29,216 --> 01:05:30,300
Here you are.

908
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,178
Thank you.

909
01:05:43,814 --> 01:05:45,857
Hi.
Hi.

910
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:48,401
Hello there.
Hello.

911
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:52,739
Hi. Oh, Tom, this is my doctor.

912
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:54,366
My son.
Travis Benjamin.

913
01:05:54,575 --> 01:05:57,035
I'm your mother's neurologist.
My son, Tom.

914
01:05:57,244 --> 01:06:00,038
Pleasure.
So how you feeling, Alice?

915
01:06:00,414 --> 01:06:01,873
I think I'm nervous.

916
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:04,709
You're gonna do great.
Break a leg.

917
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:07,003
Nice to meet you.
Yeah.

918
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:15,136
It is a great honor to welcome
our next speaker, Alice Howland.

919
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:17,973
A former professor of linguistics
at Columbia,

920
01:06:18,182 --> 01:06:22,268
she's written textbooks
and has lectured all over the world.

921
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:24,938
Alice is living
with early-onset Alzheimer's

922
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:28,441
with the care and support
of her loving family.

923
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:31,861
Please welcome Alice Howland.

924
01:06:40,037 --> 01:06:43,581
Please give me just a minute.

925
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,084
Um...

926
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:52,632
"Good morning.

927
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:55,301
It's an honor to be here.

928
01:06:55,928 --> 01:06:59,222
The poet Elizabeth Bishop once wrote:

929
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:03,601
'The art of losing isn't hard to master.

930
01:07:03,811 --> 01:07:07,605
So many things seem filled
with the intent to be lost

931
01:07:07,815 --> 01:07:10,817
that their loss is no disaster. '

932
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,736
I am not a poet.

933
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:16,823
I am a person living
with early onset Alzheimer's.

934
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:24,039
And as that person, I find myself
learning the art of losing every day.

935
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:33,006
Losing my bearings,
losing objects, losing sleep,

936
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:35,717
but mostly, losing memories. "

937
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:37,719
Oh, no.

938
01:07:43,851 --> 01:07:46,603
Thank you. Um...

939
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:50,607
I think I'll try to forget
that just happened.

940
01:07:56,489 --> 01:08:00,116
"All my life,
I've accumulated memories.

941
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:04,579
They've become, in a way,
my most precious possessions.

942
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:07,207
The night I met my husband,

943
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:11,336
the first time I held my textbook
in my hands,

944
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:18,718
having children, making friends,
traveling the world.

945
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:21,012
Everything I accumulated in life,

946
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:24,140
everything I've worked so hard for,

947
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:27,936
now all that is being ripped away.

948
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:34,567
As you can imagine, or as you know,
this is hell.

949
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:37,153
But it gets worse.

950
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:41,491
Who can take us seriously

951
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:44,619
when we are so far
from who we once were?

952
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:48,665
Our strange behavior
and fumbled sentences

953
01:08:48,874 --> 01:08:55,713
change others' perceptions of us
and our perception of ourselves.

954
01:08:55,923 --> 01:09:02,220
We become ridiculous,
incapable, comic.

955
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:04,806
But this is not who we are.

956
01:09:05,015 --> 01:09:06,766
This is our disease.

957
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:10,770
And like any disease, it has a cause,

958
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,106
it has a progression

959
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:16,025
and it could have a cure.

960
01:09:16,443 --> 01:09:20,655
My greatest wish is that my children,

961
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:27,579
our children, the next generation,
do not have to face what I am facing.

962
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:30,540
But for the time being, I'm still alive.

963
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,417
I know I'm alive.

964
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:34,794
I have people I love dearly.

965
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:39,215
I have things I wanna do with my life.

966
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:45,305
I rail against myself
for not being able to remember things,

967
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:50,643
but I still have moments in the day
of pure happiness and joy.

968
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:54,522
And please,
do not think that I am suffering.

969
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:57,192
I am not suffering.

970
01:09:57,401 --> 01:09:59,110
I am struggling.

971
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:02,906
Struggling to be a part of things,

972
01:10:03,115 --> 01:10:08,119
to stay connected to who I once was.

973
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:12,457
'So live in the moment,' I tell myself.

974
01:10:12,666 --> 01:10:15,043
It's really all I can do.

975
01:10:15,252 --> 01:10:17,212
Live in the moment.

976
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:21,090
And not beat myself up too much-

977
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:24,928
And not beat myself up too much

978
01:10:25,137 --> 01:10:29,015
for mastering the art of losing.

979
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:35,271
One thing I will try to hold on to, though,
is the memory of speaking here today.

980
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:37,523
It will go.

981
01:10:37,733 --> 01:10:39,776
I know it will.

982
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:42,946
It may be gone by tomorrow,

983
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:49,953
but it means so much
to be talking here today

984
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:52,622
like my old, ambitious self,

985
01:10:52,831 --> 01:10:55,333
who was so fascinated
by communication. "

986
01:11:03,133 --> 01:11:05,843
Thank you for this opportunity.

987
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:08,972
It means the world to me.

988
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:13,643
Thank you.

989
01:11:49,179 --> 01:11:51,347
It's the Mayo Clinic.

990
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:53,891
It would start up next spring.

991
01:11:54,101 --> 01:11:56,352
And I'd be heading up my own team.

992
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:59,439
So you want us to move to?

993
01:12:00,357 --> 01:12:01,899
It's in Rochester, Minnesota.

994
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:05,153
Well, it could be
a whole new adventure for us.

995
01:12:05,362 --> 01:12:09,073
You might even like it there.
Everything I know is here.

996
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:13,578
Anna and Tom
and the babies that are coming.

997
01:12:13,787 --> 01:12:17,373
It's just a two-hour flight.
We'd see them as often as we do now.

998
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:19,417
Ali, this just came up

999
01:12:19,626 --> 01:12:23,296
and they haven't even made
a formal offer, but don't you see?

1000
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:26,716
This is it. They're working
on many cutting-edge treatments.

1001
01:12:26,925 --> 01:12:28,885
They've got resources.
I understand.

1002
01:12:29,094 --> 01:12:31,846
I understand that work is important.

1003
01:12:32,056 --> 01:12:34,557
I miss working.

1004
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:41,481
I think you should ask them
if you can start in a year.

1005
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:45,276
It's not academia.
They don't give sabbaticals.

1006
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:49,447
But to pick up and move

1007
01:12:49,656 --> 01:12:53,159
right when- When- When- Ugh.

1008
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:55,661
Why can't I say what I wanna say?

1009
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:58,664
Ali, one way or the other,
we’ll still be together.

1010
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:01,793
So no time off?

1011
01:13:02,002 --> 01:13:05,171
I can't take a year off.
Financially, that's not an option,

1012
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:08,383
and God knows where we’ll be
further down the line.

1013
01:13:08,592 --> 01:13:10,426
That's it then. That's it.

1014
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:14,347
What?
Well, you don't- You don't want that.

1015
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:18,810
A year at home with me, watching this.

1016
01:13:21,355 --> 01:13:22,480
I didn't say that.

1017
01:13:22,689 --> 01:13:24,690
You didn't have to.

1018
01:14:36,847 --> 01:14:38,139
Ali, what are you doing?

1019
01:14:38,348 --> 01:14:39,640
I can't find it.

1020
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:42,185
You can't find what?
I can't find my phone.

1021
01:14:42,394 --> 01:14:46,063
It's the middle of the night.
It's important. It goes off at 8:00

1022
01:14:46,273 --> 01:14:49,025
and it asks me these questions.
I have to find it.

1023
01:14:49,234 --> 01:14:51,944
We'll look for it in the morning.
I have to find it.

1024
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:54,447
Help me find my phone!
I’ll help tomorrow.

1025
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:57,241
I promise you. Tomorrow.
Help me. No! I want it.

1026
01:14:57,451 --> 01:14:59,577
I’ll help you find it.
Help me find it.

1027
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:04,081
I promise, but come to bed. Come.
Help me. God. Help me find my phone.

1028
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:06,918
Come to bed with me, please.
All right.

1029
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:10,046
Please?
Okay.

1030
01:15:10,631 --> 01:15:11,672
Come on.

1031
01:15:12,633 --> 01:15:16,052
Since the beginning, I
completely understand the situation.

1032
01:15:16,261 --> 01:15:18,054
Hey.

1033
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:20,681
Anne?

1034
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:22,808
I look forward to seeing you guys.

1035
01:15:23,101 --> 01:15:27,438
Hi.
Hey, Mama. Hey.

1036
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:30,066
It's Anna, Mom.

1037
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:33,277
I thought you were my sister.

1038
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:35,488
It's okay.
How are you feeling?

1039
01:15:35,697 --> 01:15:38,491
Oh, so uncomfortable.

1040
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:41,869
I can't breathe, I can't sleep.

1041
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:43,579
Was it like this for you?

1042
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:45,706
I didn't have two at a time.

1043
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:47,458
This is true.

1044
01:15:47,668 --> 01:15:50,503
Did you get the green curry?
I did. It's right here.

1045
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:52,463
Oh, great.
Everything on track?

1046
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:55,299
Yes. They made
a very generous offer.

1047
01:15:55,509 --> 01:15:57,969
Oh, that's great.
I guess.

1048
01:15:58,178 --> 01:16:00,221
No, it is. It's the right decision.

1049
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:02,640
Would you like some water?
Yes.

1050
01:16:02,849 --> 01:16:05,685
John, what happened?
Who was on the phone?

1051
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:09,146
That was that hospital, honey,
the Mayo Clinic.

1052
01:16:09,356 --> 01:16:10,773
Is someone sick?

1053
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:12,483
No. Nothing's wrong.

1054
01:16:12,693 --> 01:16:15,111
Everything's absolutely fine.

1055
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:18,906
Oh, my God.

1056
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,744
Oh, no.

1057
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:29,208
I was looking for that last night.

1058
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:34,130
That was a month ago.
Right.

1059
01:17:52,876 --> 01:17:54,835
Ali. Hey.

1060
01:17:57,130 --> 01:17:59,632
Wake up, baby.
It's time to wake up.

1061
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:02,426
It's time to get dressed.

1062
01:18:02,636 --> 01:18:04,512
I'm gonna help you.

1063
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:08,891
I've got some very good news
for you.

1064
01:18:15,607 --> 01:18:18,317
Let me help you with your pants.
Come.

1065
01:18:18,902 --> 01:18:22,196
No, I- I want my green one.

1066
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:25,408
Oh, no, I think this one
will be really, really nice.

1067
01:18:25,617 --> 01:18:27,576
Let's put that one on.

1068
01:18:27,786 --> 01:18:29,286
Okay.

1069
01:18:32,290 --> 01:18:35,459
Okay. Lean on me.
Mm-hm.

1070
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:38,462
Okay, hold on.

1071
01:18:47,472 --> 01:18:49,098
Oh, there she is. Hey.

1072
01:18:49,307 --> 01:18:51,308
What's the matter?
She looks terrible.

1073
01:18:51,518 --> 01:18:54,019
Well, she just
delivered the babies, honey.

1074
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:02,903
Anna, you had your babies.
I did, Mom.

1075
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:06,407
- This is Allison.
- You look so beautiful.

1076
01:19:06,616 --> 01:19:08,200
Thank you.
That's Charlie Jr.

1077
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:10,119
Little Charlie.
My goodness.

1078
01:19:10,328 --> 01:19:11,912
Yes.

1079
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:18,043
There you go.
Can I hold her?

1080
01:19:18,378 --> 01:19:20,296
Is that a good idea?

1081
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:23,466
I know how to hold a baby.

1082
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:27,595
That's okay. Mom, you can sit
right there in that chair.

1083
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:31,307
There. That's good.

1084
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:35,728
There we go. All right.

1085
01:19:36,146 --> 01:19:38,272
Hi.

1086
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:41,484
Something tells
me you've done this before.

1087
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:52,995
She looks like you.

1088
01:20:03,381 --> 01:20:06,091
There are days she
knows where she is, certainly,

1089
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:09,136
but there are just as many days
when she doesn't.

1090
01:20:09,721 --> 01:20:13,182
Maybe she thinks she's a child
back in New Hampshire or who knows?

1091
01:20:13,391 --> 01:20:16,685
It's happening more and more.
She doesn't know what's going on.

1092
01:20:16,895 --> 01:20:18,521
Yeah, I just-

1093
01:20:18,730 --> 01:20:22,107
I keep thinking about what she said
in that speech, you know,

1094
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:24,235
how important her memories
are to who she is.

1095
01:20:24,444 --> 01:20:26,237
Yes, but that was months ago.

1096
01:20:26,446 --> 01:20:28,948
Guys, this is difficult for all of us.

1097
01:20:29,157 --> 01:20:32,701
But it's important to remember
who Alice was.

1098
01:20:32,911 --> 01:20:35,079
She would not want to be a burden.

1099
01:20:35,288 --> 01:20:38,040
Anna, you have the babies,
you wanna go back to work.

1100
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:41,418
You're not in a position to care
for her, not seriously, Tom.

1101
01:20:41,628 --> 01:20:43,754
And I can't keep Mayo waiting.

1102
01:20:43,964 --> 01:20:47,508
The beginning of this month, I am gone.
I want to take her with me.

1103
01:20:47,717 --> 01:20:52,096
I will get her the best possible care,
and once she's adjusted to Minnesota,

1104
01:20:52,305 --> 01:20:56,016
she will be happier for it,
and so will all of us.

1105
01:21:00,605 --> 01:21:02,690
Lydia's gonna flip.
Oh, so let her.

1106
01:21:02,899 --> 01:21:05,943
Well, she is.
Well, she has no right to.

1107
01:21:06,152 --> 01:21:08,863
If she cared, she wouldn't be
on the other side of the country.

1108
01:21:09,072 --> 01:21:11,282
Hot in here.

1109
01:21:16,621 --> 01:21:18,706
Who is he exactly?

1110
01:21:18,915 --> 01:21:22,710
His name is Bill Thompson.
He's a manager.

1111
01:21:22,919 --> 01:21:25,421
Why is he so important?

1112
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:28,591
He'll open doors for me.

1113
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,594
Get me into auditions
I wouldn't be able to get into.

1114
01:21:31,803 --> 01:21:33,554
Got me some good headshots.

1115
01:21:33,763 --> 01:21:35,598
I see.

1116
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:37,141
What's his name?

1117
01:21:38,518 --> 01:21:40,019
Bill Thompson.

1118
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:42,021
He's with Thompson
and Gould,

1119
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:44,523
if you wanna look him up.
They're good.

1120
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:46,859
Kettle's boiling.

1121
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:51,488
Where's Elena?

1122
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:54,867
I'm making myself
a cup of tea.

1123
01:21:55,285 --> 01:21:59,830
Cool. Where's, uh,
your caretaker?

1124
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:04,043
Elena's not here today.

1125
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:08,088
Her daughter's sick.
She's at the doctor.

1126
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:11,800
So you're alone?

1127
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:16,263
I can make myself a cup
of tea.

1128
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:21,352
Okay.

1129
01:22:21,978 --> 01:22:24,897
You wanna check out my
headshot? If I send you a link,

1130
01:22:25,106 --> 01:22:28,692
can you open the file,
download the file?

1131
01:22:29,277 --> 01:22:30,986
Yes.

1132
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:33,072
Good.

1133
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:36,241
Okay, um...

1134
01:22:37,911 --> 01:22:39,787
I'll talk to you later. I love you.

1135
01:22:39,996 --> 01:22:42,164
Bye.
Bye.

1136
01:23:15,115 --> 01:23:16,198
Hi.

1137
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:21,120
Alice, I'm you, and I have something
very important to say to you.

1138
01:23:22,038 --> 01:23:26,709
You've reached that point, the point
where you can't answer the questions.

1139
01:23:26,918 --> 01:23:30,087
So this is the next logical step.

1140
01:23:30,296 --> 01:23:32,131
I'm sure of it.

1141
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:34,967
Because what's happened to you.
The-

1142
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:39,096
You know, the Alzheimer's.
You could see it as tragic, but...

1143
01:23:39,639 --> 01:23:41,807
your life has been anything
but tragic.

1144
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:45,060
You have had a remarkable career

1145
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:47,021
and a great marriage

1146
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:49,648
and three beautiful children.

1147
01:23:52,152 --> 01:23:55,362
All right, listen to me. Um...

1148
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:57,906
This is important.

1149
01:23:58,116 --> 01:24:00,951
Make sure that you're alone
and go to your bedroom.

1150
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:04,413
In your bedroom,
there's a dresser with a blue lamp.

1151
01:24:04,831 --> 01:24:06,665
Open the top drawer.

1152
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:10,502
In the back of the drawer,
there's a bottle with pills in it.

1153
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:14,131
It says, "Take all pills with water. "

1154
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:17,217
Now, there are a lot of pills
in that bottle,

1155
01:24:17,427 --> 01:24:22,306
but it's very important
that you swallow them all, okay?

1156
01:24:22,515 --> 01:24:26,143
And then lie down

1157
01:24:26,352 --> 01:24:28,187
and go to sleep.

1158
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:34,318
And don't tell anyone
what you're doing, okay?

1159
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:06,266
In your bedroom, there's
a dresser with a blue lamp.

1160
01:25:06,476 --> 01:25:08,352
Open the top drawer.

1161
01:25:08,561 --> 01:25:12,022
In the back of the drawer,
there's a bottle with pills in it.

1162
01:25:12,232 --> 01:25:15,567
It says,
"Take all pills with water. "

1163
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:22,866
Dresser with lamp. Dresser...

1164
01:25:23,076 --> 01:25:26,245
Blue lamp. Dresser.

1165
01:25:38,758 --> 01:25:41,593
Make sure that you're alone
and go to your bedroom.

1166
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:45,180
In your bedroom,
there's a dresser with a blue lamp.

1167
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:47,307
Open the top drawer.

1168
01:25:47,517 --> 01:25:51,103
In the back of the drawer,
there's a bottle with pills in it.

1169
01:25:51,312 --> 01:25:54,773
It says, "Take all pills with water. "

1170
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:57,609
Now, there are a lot of pills
in that bottle,

1171
01:25:57,819 --> 01:26:02,948
but it's very important
that you swallow them all, okay?

1172
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:08,745
And then lie down and go to sleep.

1173
01:26:11,374 --> 01:26:16,086
And don't tell anyone
what you're doing, okay?

1174
01:26:34,939 --> 01:26:36,607
Hello?

1175
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:12,726
May I have a cookies-and-cream
and a chocolate hazelnut?

1176
01:27:13,186 --> 01:27:14,519
You know what you want.

1177
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:16,855
Cookies-and-cream
and chocolate hazelnut.

1178
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:20,275
You usually have the original
with blueberries and coconut.

1179
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:21,526
Okay.

1180
01:27:21,736 --> 01:27:24,821
Original with blueberries
and coconut, please.

1181
01:27:34,874 --> 01:27:37,542
Ali, you see that building
over there?

1182
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:39,503
Do you know what that is?

1183
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:42,965
I don't think I know that.

1184
01:27:43,591 --> 01:27:46,885
That's Columbia,
where you used to teach.

1185
01:27:47,762 --> 01:27:51,223
Someone told me
I was a good teacher.

1186
01:27:51,432 --> 01:27:54,142
Yes. You were.

1187
01:27:56,271 --> 01:27:57,771
I was really smart.

1188
01:28:00,066 --> 01:28:02,985
You were the smartest person
I've ever met.

1189
01:28:09,242 --> 01:28:13,704
Ali, do you still wanna be here?

1190
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:19,209
I'm not done yet.

1191
01:28:19,419 --> 01:28:20,711
Do we have to go?

1192
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:23,797
No.

1193
01:28:24,966 --> 01:28:26,591
Don't worry.

1194
01:28:26,801 --> 01:28:28,635
Take your time.

1195
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:56,788
- Is this all of your stuff?
- I shipped some boxes as well.

1196
01:28:57,290 --> 01:28:59,541
Are you sad to leave L.A.?

1197
01:28:59,876 --> 01:29:02,711
I'm trying to convince myself
I'm an East Coast girl.

1198
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:04,504
Where's Mom?

1199
01:29:04,839 --> 01:29:06,673
She's sleeping.

1200
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:12,721
Well, here it is.

1201
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:15,057
Your old room.

1202
01:29:16,267 --> 01:29:17,601
Wow.

1203
01:29:22,982 --> 01:29:25,901
So how did it work out
with your manager?

1204
01:29:26,861 --> 01:29:30,530
It's a West Coast company, you know.
Not so good.

1205
01:29:31,074 --> 01:29:34,409
Well, that's too bad.
Are you sure you don't mind?

1206
01:29:35,995 --> 01:29:38,372
We've had this conversation.

1207
01:29:39,123 --> 01:29:40,582
Okay.

1208
01:29:40,792 --> 01:29:44,711
It's New York City.
I’ll audition, do theater.

1209
01:29:45,588 --> 01:29:48,423
I know that this is where
I need to be, though, so...

1210
01:29:49,509 --> 01:29:51,885
You're a better man than I am.

1211
01:29:53,763 --> 01:29:57,349
Dad, I've got her, okay?

1212
01:30:42,895 --> 01:30:45,230
It's getting pretty cold, huh?

1213
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:47,774
Wanna head home?

1214
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:51,278
Come on, let's do it.

1215
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:08,628
Birds go by above you

1216
01:31:09,338 --> 01:31:13,216
Sing away your blues♪

1217
01:31:15,261 --> 01:31:17,095
Hey.
Hi.

1218
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:18,972
How was your walk?

1219
01:31:19,182 --> 01:31:20,765
I don't think I know you.

1220
01:31:20,975 --> 01:31:23,059
Yes, you do.
Hey, Mom, it's Elena.

1221
01:31:23,269 --> 01:31:25,187
I'm gonna get you
some juice, okay?

1222
01:31:25,396 --> 01:31:28,899
Come, let's take off your coat
and go inside.

1223
01:31:45,374 --> 01:31:49,002
"Night flight to San Francisco,
chase the moon across America.

1224
01:31:49,754 --> 01:31:52,714
God, it's been years
since I was on a plane.

1225
01:31:53,049 --> 01:31:56,259
When we hit 35,000 feet,
we’ll have reached the tropopause,

1226
01:31:56,469 --> 01:31:59,679
the great belt of calm air.

1227
01:32:00,848 --> 01:32:05,268
As close to the ozone as I'll get,
I- I dreamed we were there.

1228
01:32:05,978 --> 01:32:08,980
The plane leapt the tropopause,

1229
01:32:09,565 --> 01:32:14,069
the safe air, and attained the outer rim,
the ozone, which was ragged and torn,

1230
01:32:14,278 --> 01:32:18,323
patches of it threadbare
as old cheesecloth, and that was...

1231
01:32:19,075 --> 01:32:20,867
frightening.

1232
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:23,119
But I saw something only I could see

1233
01:32:23,329 --> 01:32:26,456
because of my astonishing ability
to see such things.

1234
01:32:28,459 --> 01:32:31,127
Souls were rising...

1235
01:32:32,338 --> 01:32:34,923
from the earth far below,
souls of the dead,

1236
01:32:35,132 --> 01:32:37,551
of people who'd perished

1237
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:40,762
from famine, from war,
from the plague...

1238
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:48,228
and they floated up,
like skydivers in reverse,

1239
01:32:48,437 --> 01:32:53,108
limbs all akimbo,
wheeling, spinning.

1240
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:56,945
The souls of these departed
joined hands, clasped ankles

1241
01:32:57,154 --> 01:33:01,199
and formed a web,
a great net of souls.

1242
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:06,580
And the souls were three-atom
oxygen molecules of the stuff of ozone

1243
01:33:06,789 --> 01:33:10,834
and the outer rim absorbed them,
and was repaired.

1244
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:17,424
Because nothing is lost forever.

1245
01:33:21,137 --> 01:33:23,930
In this world,
there's a kind of painful progress.

1246
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:27,142
A longing for what we've left behind...

1247
01:33:29,145 --> 01:33:31,187
and dreaming ahead.

1248
01:33:32,273 --> 01:33:34,482
At least I think that's so. "

1249
01:33:36,902 --> 01:33:38,570
That's it.

1250
01:33:47,663 --> 01:33:48,913
Hey.

1251
01:33:52,543 --> 01:33:54,502
Did you like that?

1252
01:33:58,716 --> 01:34:02,719
What I just read, did you like it?
Hm.

1253
01:34:02,887 --> 01:34:04,429
Yeah.

1254
01:34:10,728 --> 01:34:12,479
And what-?

1255
01:34:13,689 --> 01:34:15,357
What was it about?

1256
01:34:19,445 --> 01:34:21,071
Love.

1257
01:34:21,822 --> 01:34:22,864
Yeah. Love.

1258
01:34:23,991 --> 01:34:25,659
Yeah, Mom.

1259
01:34:27,703 --> 01:34:29,829
It was about love.

1260
01:35:13,666 --> 01:35:16,584
If I had a boat

1261
01:35:16,919 --> 01:35:19,921
I'd go out on the ocean

1262
01:35:20,297 --> 01:35:22,882
And if I had a pony

1263
01:35:23,551 --> 01:35:26,511
I'd ride him on my boat

1264
01:35:26,846 --> 01:35:29,556
And we could all together

1265
01:35:30,182 --> 01:35:33,059
Go out on the ocean

1266
01:35:33,227 --> 01:35:38,189
Set me upon my pony on my boat

1267
01:35:40,109 --> 01:35:43,111
If I were Roy Rogers

1268
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:46,114
I'd sure enough be single

1269
01:35:46,282 --> 01:35:51,369
I couldn't bring myself
To marrying old Dale

1270
01:35:52,913 --> 01:35:55,790
It'd just be me and Trigger

1271
01:35:56,125 --> 01:35:59,335
Go riding through them movies

1272
01:35:59,503 --> 01:36:04,591
Then we'd buy a boat
And on the sea we'd sail

1273
01:36:05,885 --> 01:36:08,845
And if I had a boat

1274
01:36:09,430 --> 01:36:12,140
I'd go out on the ocean

1275
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:15,310
And if I had a pony

1276
01:36:15,686 --> 01:36:18,188
I'd ride him on my boat

1277
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:21,524
And we could all together

1278
01:36:22,109 --> 01:36:24,944
Go out on the ocean

1279
01:36:25,112 --> 01:36:30,325
Set me upon my pony on my boat

1280
01:36:31,827 --> 01:36:34,704
The mystery masked man was smart

1281
01:36:34,872 --> 01:36:37,999
He got himself a Tonto

1282
01:36:38,167 --> 01:36:42,921
'Cause Tonto did the dirty work
For free

1283
01:36:44,632 --> 01:36:47,342
But Tonto he was smarter

1284
01:36:47,718 --> 01:36:50,637
And one day said, "Kemo sabe

1285
01:36:51,222 --> 01:36:57,644
Kiss my ass, I bought a boat
I'm going out to sea"

1286
01:36:59,188 --> 01:37:01,773
And if I had a boat

1287
01:37:02,566 --> 01:37:05,276
I'd go out on the ocean

1288
01:37:05,694 --> 01:37:08,238
And if I had a pony

1289
01:37:08,906 --> 01:37:11,282
I'd ride him on my boat

1290
01:37:11,992 --> 01:37:14,786
And we could all together

1291
01:37:15,287 --> 01:37:18,081
Go out on the ocean

1292
01:37:18,249 --> 01:37:23,253
Set me upon my pony on my boat

1293
01:37:53,242 --> 01:37:56,494
And if I were like lightning

1294
01:37:56,871 --> 01:38:00,081
I wouldn't need no sneakers

1295
01:38:00,374 --> 01:38:05,962
I'd come and go
Wherever I would please

1296
01:38:06,881 --> 01:38:10,091
And I'd scare 'em by the shade tree

1297
01:38:10,259 --> 01:38:13,386
And I'd scare 'em by the light pole

1298
01:38:13,554 --> 01:38:20,518
But I would not scare my pony
On my boat out on the sea

1299
01:38:21,979 --> 01:38:24,772
And if I had a boat

1300
01:38:25,232 --> 01:38:28,276
I'd go out on the ocean

1301
01:38:28,444 --> 01:38:30,945
And if I had a pony

1302
01:38:31,739 --> 01:38:35,533
I'd ride him on my boat

1303
01:38:36,410 --> 01:38:39,245
And we could all together

1304
01:38:39,663 --> 01:38:42,290
Go out on the ocean

1305
01:38:42,458 --> 01:38:47,462
Set me upon my pony on my boat

1306
01:38:48,714 --> 01:38:57,513
Set me upon my pony on my boat
