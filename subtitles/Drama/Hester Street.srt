1
00:02:43,724 --> 00:02:47,216
Ah, Mamie. Mamie,
you should be nice to Mr. Lipman.

2
00:02:47,327 --> 00:02:49,352
Why, may I ask?

3
00:02:49,463 --> 00:02:52,489
Ain't you never heard of Lipman
and Davidowitz, men's clothes?

4
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:54,590
That's the same Lipman!

5
00:02:54,701 --> 00:02:58,432
Where is this?
The old country, huh?

6
00:02:58,539 --> 00:03:00,564
Is this Poland? Is this Russia?

7
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:04,343
She's a hundred percent right, Joe.

8
00:03:04,444 --> 00:03:07,709
In America, you marry for love

9
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:10,712
and that's all.

10
00:03:10,818 --> 00:03:13,912
Who said different?

11
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:16,182
Furthermore,

12
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:20,488
I got quite a bit saved myself already.

13
00:03:20,594 --> 00:03:22,721
An orphan got to get her own dowry.

14
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,924
Dowry! I thought this
was America.

15
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:27,830
I don't want no man to say,

16
00:03:27,935 --> 00:03:32,201
"I had to take her just as she was,
without a penny."

17
00:03:33,707 --> 00:03:36,471
So, so where you live?

18
00:03:36,577 --> 00:03:38,010
I board in.

19
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:40,238
No! Me also!

20
00:03:40,347 --> 00:03:42,611
No!

21
00:03:42,716 --> 00:03:46,482
I sleep in the parlor
with my landlady's two daughters.

22
00:03:48,322 --> 00:03:52,691
I, I got a bed all to myself.

23
00:03:52,793 --> 00:03:54,886
No.

24
00:03:54,995 --> 00:03:58,089
Well, it ain't actual a bed.

25
00:03:58,198 --> 00:04:02,259
It's a...
It's a lounge.

26
00:04:02,369 --> 00:04:05,133
What a bluffer you is, Jake.

27
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:07,764
You treatin'? Give a look.

28
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:11,436
What'll it be?

29
00:04:11,545 --> 00:04:14,105
Where's that waiter?

30
00:04:14,214 --> 00:04:19,481
Ladies and gents, meet Schloime Navasky.
Just come over this very day.

31
00:04:19,586 --> 00:04:25,081
Oh! Oh! Oh! Hey!
Sit 'im right down here.

32
00:04:25,192 --> 00:04:27,023
Sit!

33
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:31,154
Scared to death.
Look at him.

34
00:04:31,265 --> 00:04:35,998
They must have oxen
in steerage these days.

35
00:04:36,103 --> 00:04:38,731
Oh, he's laughing! Look at him!

36
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:41,364
Waiter, another glass tea.

37
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,207
Oh!

38
00:04:47,814 --> 00:04:49,611
Careful.

39
00:04:49,716 --> 00:04:54,244
Oh! Is that a sight?

40
00:05:08,502 --> 00:05:10,868
Pincus Levinsky.

41
00:05:10,971 --> 00:05:13,906
Oh! I know Charlie Levinsky.

42
00:05:14,007 --> 00:05:15,736
I know a Kaminsky.

43
00:05:15,842 --> 00:05:19,243
I know Sora Gilinsky.
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

44
00:05:19,346 --> 00:05:23,407
He will soon learn, in America there is
no such thing as relatives, eh?

45
00:05:25,352 --> 00:05:27,513
Ah, here.

46
00:05:29,156 --> 00:05:32,182
Take two. It's America!

47
00:05:44,871 --> 00:05:47,203
Huh?

48
00:05:47,307 --> 00:05:52,540
Oh, his hat! Oh!

49
00:06:05,425 --> 00:06:08,622
Hey! Welcome to America!

50
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:13,227
No, Jake, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

51
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,267
What's the matter?
You got somebody else?

52
00:06:15,369 --> 00:06:17,269
Look who's talking.
Me?

53
00:06:17,371 --> 00:06:20,829
Shh!

54
00:06:20,941 --> 00:06:22,806
What about Fanny?
Fanny?

55
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:24,433
Shh!

56
00:06:24,544 --> 00:06:26,569
We work in the same shop,
and that's all.

57
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,375
Huh!

58
00:06:29,983 --> 00:06:31,780
Let's go inside.
Let me explain.

59
00:06:31,885 --> 00:06:34,683
No. My landlady.

60
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:39,322
All right.

61
00:06:41,728 --> 00:06:43,025
Good-bye.

62
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,361
Jake. Wait.

63
00:06:46,466 --> 00:06:48,263
For what?

64
00:07:27,307 --> 00:07:29,502
Poor little orphan.

65
00:07:29,609 --> 00:07:31,600
When you come over?

66
00:07:31,711 --> 00:07:33,474
Seven years.

67
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:38,347
I come all alone from Poland
when I was 16 years old.

68
00:07:40,187 --> 00:07:42,917
You speak English like a Yankee.
Thank you.

69
00:07:43,023 --> 00:07:46,015
I would think you was born here.

70
00:07:47,227 --> 00:07:49,752
Hey!
Ma?

71
00:07:49,863 --> 00:07:51,797
Over here.

72
00:08:49,623 --> 00:08:54,686
Bernstein, what was you
in the old country, huh?

73
00:08:54,794 --> 00:08:57,194
A yeshiva student?

74
00:08:57,297 --> 00:09:01,495
Sit on your tochiss all day
in the study house, huh?

75
00:09:01,601 --> 00:09:04,798
And the women is bringing the food
for the scholar,

76
00:09:04,905 --> 00:09:06,770
and everyone is fighting,

77
00:09:06,873 --> 00:09:10,832
"Stay by my house, stay by me!

78
00:09:13,013 --> 00:09:17,950
And please do me the honor
to marry with my daughter."

79
00:09:19,486 --> 00:09:23,946
Well, I wasn't no boss in Lithuania.

80
00:09:24,057 --> 00:09:25,786
No, sir.

81
00:09:25,892 --> 00:09:28,486
Give a guess what I was.

82
00:09:28,595 --> 00:09:30,358
A peddler.

83
00:09:30,463 --> 00:09:33,796
Ah! I told you already?

84
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,267
Hmph. Some country, America.

85
00:09:38,538 --> 00:09:40,631
The peddler becomes the boss,

86
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,937
and the yishiva bocher
sits by the sewing machine.

87
00:09:44,044 --> 00:09:46,274
Some country, huh, Jake?

88
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:48,973
You betcha!

89
00:09:49,082 --> 00:09:52,677
This is one of the locusts from Egypt.

90
00:09:52,786 --> 00:09:55,152
Huh? Look at him.

91
00:09:55,255 --> 00:09:58,349
Boss, what time?
Is 12:00 yet?

92
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:03,987
What if it is? After 12:00,
starts all over again, ain't it?

93
00:10:04,097 --> 00:10:05,928
Half after.

94
00:10:16,676 --> 00:10:18,644
So you will ask, huh?

95
00:10:18,745 --> 00:10:22,146
First thing I get to the house!
Good.

96
00:10:22,249 --> 00:10:24,080
Fanny!

97
00:10:25,852 --> 00:10:28,548
What's the hurry?

98
00:10:29,823 --> 00:10:32,951
You're finished with Fanny, huh?

99
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:35,323
Why? You want Fanny?

100
00:10:35,428 --> 00:10:38,955
That kind of a woman,
that's not for me.

101
00:10:40,934 --> 00:10:43,630
So what kind of woman is for you?

102
00:10:48,008 --> 00:10:49,839
Bernstein.

103
00:10:53,346 --> 00:10:55,746
So you went to the marriage broker, huh?

104
00:12:06,686 --> 00:12:08,813
Mrs. Kavarsky!

105
00:12:08,922 --> 00:12:12,949
A man works in my shop,
and he needs a home. Do you got?

106
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:16,426
You better be looking yourself,
Mr. Podkovnik.

107
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:20,932
They took your landlady away
to the hospital.

108
00:12:21,034 --> 00:12:24,128
Her sister come for Feigle already.

109
00:12:28,007 --> 00:12:30,532
Oh, wait, wait.

110
00:12:30,643 --> 00:12:33,635
It come this morning so I keep for you.

111
00:12:39,452 --> 00:12:41,443
Go. Leave me in peace.

112
00:12:43,223 --> 00:12:46,124
What's the matter?

113
00:12:47,994 --> 00:12:49,894
Read it.

114
00:12:59,272 --> 00:13:00,603
Who?

115
00:13:02,275 --> 00:13:05,073
My wife?

116
00:13:05,178 --> 00:13:07,237
My son?

117
00:13:07,347 --> 00:13:10,475
Your father has been freed.

118
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,484
May he have a bright paradise.

119
00:13:57,864 --> 00:14:01,732
Oh, excuse me, missus.

120
00:14:01,835 --> 00:14:04,269
Who is the landlord in this house?

121
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,838
Epstein.

122
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,238
Would you...

123
00:14:09,342 --> 00:14:11,742
Would you tell him Podkovnik
will take the place?

124
00:14:11,845 --> 00:14:16,111
Oh? For what you need
a whole apartment?

125
00:14:16,216 --> 00:14:20,550
Mr. Podkovnik getting married maybe?
It's too much trouble?

126
00:14:20,653 --> 00:14:23,781
Don't get excited.
Right away. I'll tell Epstein.

127
00:14:25,558 --> 00:14:30,586
The furniture, can I keep?

128
00:14:30,697 --> 00:14:34,827
If the sister don't come for it,
I said I would sell it.

129
00:14:34,934 --> 00:14:36,868
But who wants?

130
00:14:38,071 --> 00:14:39,971
I want.

131
00:14:42,242 --> 00:14:46,372
Twenty-five dollars
would be a bargain.

132
00:14:48,348 --> 00:14:50,248
All right, I buy it.

133
00:14:55,522 --> 00:14:58,650
I got you a room.

134
00:14:58,758 --> 00:15:00,988
Huh?

135
00:15:01,094 --> 00:15:04,154
I got you a room. Two dollars a week,
meals and washing included.

136
00:15:04,264 --> 00:15:06,494
Thanks, Jake.
By the neighbor lady?

137
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:09,995
No, with me.

138
00:15:27,687 --> 00:15:31,088
Well, well, well!

139
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:35,320
I was thinking
maybe you moved to Chicago?

140
00:15:35,428 --> 00:15:37,396
I, uh...

141
00:15:39,232 --> 00:15:41,757
I've been busy, Mamie.
That's nice.

142
00:15:44,237 --> 00:15:47,798
Don't even bother to clean yourself up
when you call on a girl.

143
00:15:49,008 --> 00:15:53,809
Mamie, I gotta talk to you
about something special.

144
00:15:53,913 --> 00:15:55,403
Oh!

145
00:16:02,622 --> 00:16:04,487
Mamie...

146
00:16:09,963 --> 00:16:15,265
Ah, Mamie, about this money
you got saved.

147
00:16:17,136 --> 00:16:19,001
What about it?

148
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:22,537
I got a chance for a big bargain.

149
00:16:22,642 --> 00:16:25,634
Oh! What?

150
00:16:25,745 --> 00:16:27,508
Furniture!

151
00:16:27,614 --> 00:16:29,980
What kind of furniture?

152
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,641
What kind?

153
00:16:31,751 --> 00:16:34,311
A stove,

154
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,981
a table, chair, pots, pans.

155
00:16:39,859 --> 00:16:44,387
Mamie, I gotta have my own place.

156
00:16:49,135 --> 00:16:51,103
Jake.

157
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,038
You give?

158
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,608
Jake, you monkey!

159
00:16:56,776 --> 00:16:59,142
I'll pay back every penny.
I swear.

160
00:16:59,245 --> 00:17:01,907
Don't bother yourself.

161
00:17:09,322 --> 00:17:11,813
Eh...

162
00:17:11,924 --> 00:17:13,983
You got in your pocket, maybe?

163
00:17:14,093 --> 00:17:17,654
What?
The money.

164
00:17:17,764 --> 00:17:20,062
Oh, you want it right away?

165
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,463
You betcha!

166
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:24,161
Come upstairs.

167
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,238
What about your landlady?

168
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:31,606
Oh, this is a different thing now,
ain't it?

169
00:17:35,982 --> 00:17:41,249
Listen. Better you should get, huh?

170
00:17:41,354 --> 00:17:44,721
Anything you say, Jake.

171
00:17:44,824 --> 00:17:47,088
You're the boss now.

172
00:18:08,314 --> 00:18:11,613
Three years I sleep there.

173
00:18:11,718 --> 00:18:14,118
Now where will you sleep?

174
00:18:31,838 --> 00:18:34,204
For who is the little bed?

175
00:18:34,307 --> 00:18:36,241
My son.

176
00:18:36,342 --> 00:18:38,640
What son is that?

177
00:18:38,745 --> 00:18:40,645
I only got one son.

178
00:18:40,747 --> 00:18:43,307
Jake, what is this?

179
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:48,718
Did I ever say I was a single man?
Well, did I?

180
00:20:11,604 --> 00:20:12,901
Yankel!

181
00:20:18,978 --> 00:20:20,502
Yankel!

182
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:00,178
For what purpose
are you bringing this woman in?

183
00:21:02,521 --> 00:21:07,049
For what purpose
are you bringing this woman in?

184
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:11,926
Uh, for the purpose,
she's my wife.

185
00:21:16,802 --> 00:21:19,498
And that's your son?

186
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:28,410
Sha!

187
00:21:29,849 --> 00:21:32,443
This woman is my wife and that's all!

188
00:21:35,187 --> 00:21:37,348
Where's the marriage certificate?

189
00:22:44,123 --> 00:22:47,251
This is my missus.

190
00:22:48,561 --> 00:22:50,722
This is Mr. Bernstein.

191
00:24:12,511 --> 00:24:14,411
Gitl.

192
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:35,192
Yankel.

193
00:26:25,511 --> 00:26:27,172
Yankel.

194
00:28:35,874 --> 00:28:39,503
Look at him.
A little Yankee.

195
00:28:39,611 --> 00:28:42,011
Yankee?

196
00:28:42,114 --> 00:28:45,572
Listen to him!"Yankee."

197
00:28:58,697 --> 00:29:00,528
Joey.

198
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,665
Joey!

199
00:29:05,471 --> 00:29:07,132
Joey.

200
00:30:21,246 --> 00:30:24,238
Come. Come to Papa.

201
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,199
Say it, Joey. Horse.

202
00:31:21,273 --> 00:31:23,503
Horse.
Horse?

203
00:32:48,894 --> 00:32:50,384
Jake?

204
00:32:52,197 --> 00:32:53,824
Jake!

205
00:32:55,901 --> 00:32:58,199
Good morning.

206
00:32:58,303 --> 00:33:01,329
What's the matter? You didn't come
to the dancing class for a long time.

207
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,465
The ladies keep asking,
"Where's Jake?"

208
00:33:03,575 --> 00:33:05,406
Horse, Ta'teh.

209
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:08,035
Horse.
Mister, give him.

210
00:33:08,146 --> 00:33:11,582
Ta'teh?
What else?

211
00:33:15,854 --> 00:33:17,879
Upon my word!

212
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,924
What is wrong, if I may ask?

213
00:33:20,025 --> 00:33:23,517
You got a boy.
That means you got a wife also?

214
00:33:23,629 --> 00:33:26,530
Certainly! Upstairs.

215
00:33:26,632 --> 00:33:28,998
They come yesterday only.

216
00:33:29,534 --> 00:33:31,661
Yankel.

217
00:33:59,531 --> 00:34:01,328
Gitl.

218
00:35:41,366 --> 00:35:42,697
Yossele.

219
00:35:46,071 --> 00:35:50,735
Stove.
Stove. Stove.

220
00:36:00,852 --> 00:36:03,116
Lunch.

221
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:09,123
Table.

222
00:36:20,472 --> 00:36:23,669
Bernstein, you want
she should be green always?

223
00:36:26,344 --> 00:36:29,177
Good evening, missus.

224
00:36:30,649 --> 00:36:31,946
Gitl?

225
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:38,116
Good evening.

226
00:36:42,194 --> 00:36:45,686
Joey! Come. Come on.

227
00:36:46,598 --> 00:36:48,225
Here, sit.

228
00:37:09,087 --> 00:37:14,252
Mmm! By gum, this is good!

229
00:37:18,163 --> 00:37:21,655
This son of mine going to be president
United States. No, Bernstein?

230
00:37:21,766 --> 00:37:26,135
No. The president must be American born.
It's written in the Constitution.

231
00:37:35,614 --> 00:37:40,745
Bernstein, you wish you had a son
like my Joey, huh?

232
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,055
Get married, and you soon will.

233
00:37:45,156 --> 00:37:47,420
How come you so particular?

234
00:37:47,525 --> 00:37:52,758
What you say to the marriage broker,
he can't find you a wife?

235
00:37:52,864 --> 00:37:55,059
Listen, go back again.

236
00:37:55,166 --> 00:37:58,067
Say, „I’ll take whatever you got

237
00:37:58,169 --> 00:38:02,299
as long as she got two eyes,
a nose and a mouth."

238
00:38:03,642 --> 00:38:06,543
Look at him, shvitzing!

239
00:38:24,296 --> 00:38:26,730
Come in!
Come in.

240
00:38:29,868 --> 00:38:31,165
Good evening, Jake.

241
00:38:33,571 --> 00:38:35,630
Mamie.

242
00:38:45,383 --> 00:38:48,546
Ah, Miss Fein,

243
00:38:48,653 --> 00:38:49,984
my wife.

244
00:38:54,492 --> 00:38:58,451
How you do?
Pleased to meet you.

245
00:39:01,766 --> 00:39:04,166
Say, „I’m glad to meet you."

246
00:39:05,637 --> 00:39:07,969
She is still a greener.

247
00:39:08,073 --> 00:39:12,373
Never mind.
She'll soon "oysgreen" herself.

248
00:39:37,902 --> 00:39:41,429
What a darling!

249
00:39:41,539 --> 00:39:43,666
What a darling.
What's his name?

250
00:39:43,775 --> 00:39:45,538
Joey.

251
00:39:45,643 --> 00:39:50,478
Joey! Joey, come here. Come here.

252
00:39:50,582 --> 00:39:54,518
Are you a good boy, Joey?

253
00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:56,519
Give me a kiss.

254
00:39:56,621 --> 00:40:01,320
Mmm! Oh, that's nice. So nice.

255
00:40:02,794 --> 00:40:05,456
Here.
Mama.

256
00:40:19,144 --> 00:40:20,975
Mamie.

257
00:40:24,549 --> 00:40:28,315
About the $25.
Huh! I should cough.

258
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:31,184
A couple of weeks.
No, sir. Now!

259
00:40:33,758 --> 00:40:36,192
I don't know where you get it though.

260
00:40:36,294 --> 00:40:39,525
A married man
with a darling little wife.

261
00:40:40,932 --> 00:40:45,460
I must remember to ask your wife
how she likes the furniture.

262
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:48,334
The furniture you bought
with my money.

263
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,876
I'll pay you every penny, Mamie.

264
00:40:51,976 --> 00:40:54,911
Just don't say nothing to her, please.

265
00:40:55,013 --> 00:40:57,914
What do I care?
I want my money!

266
00:40:58,016 --> 00:41:00,814
I worked hard enough for it!

267
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:02,887
I'll say what I like to your wife.

268
00:41:06,157 --> 00:41:10,253
Oh, don't you like it?
Lump it!

269
00:41:14,732 --> 00:41:16,825
Don't talk English.
She will think something.

270
00:41:16,935 --> 00:41:20,132
What do I care what she thinks?

271
00:41:20,238 --> 00:41:22,297
I want she should know.

272
00:41:24,409 --> 00:41:28,368
It's lucky I still remember a word
or two of the old language.

273
00:41:29,714 --> 00:41:31,807
I'll tell her what's what.

274
00:41:35,386 --> 00:41:39,220
Never mind! I don't
wanna stay here anyhow.

275
00:41:42,327 --> 00:41:45,626
Good-bye, Mrs. Podkovnik.

276
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:48,198
I hope you will enjoy America.

277
00:42:00,345 --> 00:42:02,643
Mamie!

278
00:42:09,187 --> 00:42:14,181
Mamie. Where can I see you?

279
00:42:14,292 --> 00:42:18,558
Well, you can't come by
the dancing academy no more, huh?

280
00:42:18,663 --> 00:42:22,099
Wait a minute. If I want,
I can go there more than I used to.

281
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,395
Mamie.

282
00:42:40,485 --> 00:42:42,316
Mmm.

283
00:42:52,964 --> 00:42:56,422
You know where I live, don't you?

284
00:42:57,902 --> 00:43:00,769
Or did you forget?

285
00:43:00,872 --> 00:43:04,308
I don't forget.
What a short mind you got.

286
00:43:04,409 --> 00:43:07,344
I won't forget nothing.
I'll come.

287
00:43:07,445 --> 00:43:10,608
Huh. You're bluffing.

288
00:43:10,715 --> 00:43:13,206
I'll come. I should live so.

289
00:43:19,591 --> 00:43:21,422
All right.

290
00:43:23,528 --> 00:43:25,928
But bring my $25.

291
00:43:30,101 --> 00:43:32,228
Or you'll see.

292
00:48:38,242 --> 00:48:41,211
Come, come.

293
00:48:41,312 --> 00:48:42,779
Come.

294
00:48:55,426 --> 00:48:58,327
You think you're still in Russia?

295
00:48:58,429 --> 00:49:00,624
Love potions!

296
00:49:02,033 --> 00:49:06,299
Look at you. Like a bubbe
with a patch on the head!

297
00:49:06,404 --> 00:49:08,304
Why should he love you?

298
00:49:08,406 --> 00:49:10,306
Fifty times I am telling you,

299
00:49:10,408 --> 00:49:14,572
"Fix yourself. Look like a woman
that lives in America."

300
00:49:14,679 --> 00:49:17,113
I won't be a goyah,
even for Yankel.

301
00:49:17,214 --> 00:49:20,206
What's the use?
I'm talking to the wall.

302
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:25,616
Why should I bother myself?

303
00:49:28,793 --> 00:49:31,318
What about at night in the bed?

304
00:49:31,429 --> 00:49:34,796
Don't tell me.
I know the answer already. Nothing.

305
00:49:41,505 --> 00:49:45,498
Look at me. Am I a goyah?

306
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:49,910
I'm as pious as you anyhow.
And I go with my own hair, don't I?

307
00:49:50,014 --> 00:49:53,814
Plenty time for the patch
when I get old.

308
00:49:53,918 --> 00:49:56,614
While I'm young, I'm young.
And that's all.

309
00:49:58,489 --> 00:50:01,754
It can't be helped!

310
00:50:01,859 --> 00:50:06,887
We live in an educated country,
so we dress like educated people.

311
00:50:06,998 --> 00:50:09,933
As they say, „Ladies first."

312
00:50:10,034 --> 00:50:12,468
Hold in. Hold.

313
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:14,037
It hurts.

314
00:50:14,138 --> 00:50:17,699
It hurts?
That means it's working.

315
00:50:22,313 --> 00:50:24,611
Hold, hold now. Hold. Good.

316
00:50:28,452 --> 00:50:30,181
Oh, yeah!

317
00:50:30,287 --> 00:50:32,312
That right?
Yeah, it's all right.

318
00:50:32,423 --> 00:50:33,788
It's sure tight.

319
00:50:33,891 --> 00:50:36,223
You wanna be an American,
you gotta hurt.

320
00:50:40,197 --> 00:50:41,664
My best!

321
00:50:41,766 --> 00:50:46,294
I don't buy from a pushcart.
I buy inside, by the way. Huh?

322
00:50:46,404 --> 00:50:48,634
How do you like, huh?

323
00:50:48,739 --> 00:50:50,764
Yeah? Yeah?

324
00:50:50,875 --> 00:50:53,070
Maybe you got one with feathers?

325
00:50:53,177 --> 00:50:56,840
You want a hat with feathers?
Feathers, you'll get!

326
00:51:08,626 --> 00:51:10,924
Here.

327
00:51:11,028 --> 00:51:16,091
Oh! Ah, ah, beautiful!

328
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,135
Oh, look. Give a look. Huh?

329
00:51:19,236 --> 00:51:22,933
A regular uptown lady.

330
00:51:24,008 --> 00:51:25,942
Here, like that.

331
00:51:26,043 --> 00:51:28,511
Hmm? You like it?

332
00:52:05,249 --> 00:52:09,743
Evening, missus.
He must work late again.

333
00:52:09,854 --> 00:52:14,188
It's the busy season. The boss
keeps him. And Jake is the best worker.

334
00:52:19,563 --> 00:52:21,656
Yossele.

335
00:53:08,779 --> 00:53:10,212
Base.

336
00:53:11,415 --> 00:53:13,508
Base.

337
00:54:23,821 --> 00:54:26,051
Mamie! Oh, Mamie.

338
00:54:26,156 --> 00:54:29,125
You bring my money?

339
00:54:29,226 --> 00:54:31,854
I gotta speak to you now.
Get away from me!

340
00:54:31,962 --> 00:54:34,294
Please, I come all the way from work!

341
00:54:43,741 --> 00:54:47,404
Is it my fault you got a short mind?

342
00:54:47,511 --> 00:54:49,502
Today is Wednesday.

343
00:54:49,613 --> 00:54:51,581
You was by dancing.

344
00:54:51,682 --> 00:54:55,982
And why not? I'm a single girl.
I can go where I want.

345
00:54:56,086 --> 00:54:57,781
You think I can't?

346
00:54:57,888 --> 00:55:01,380
A married man at a dancing academy
with his little wife draggin' after.

347
00:55:01,492 --> 00:55:05,019
You give me a regular pain!
Shut up out there!

348
00:55:05,129 --> 00:55:07,791
I don't have nothing to do
with a married man, Jake Podkovnik!

349
00:55:07,898 --> 00:55:11,925
You got my money. You give it!
Otherwise you go to hell!

350
00:55:16,006 --> 00:55:18,440
You go to hell!

351
00:55:18,542 --> 00:55:21,102
You ain't worth my wife's
little finger!

352
00:55:21,211 --> 00:55:23,008
You either!

353
00:55:29,286 --> 00:55:32,585
Oh, you! Don't tell me.

354
00:55:35,059 --> 00:55:37,493
Jake.
Jake.

355
00:55:38,696 --> 00:55:40,823
I'm so busy tonight.

356
00:55:43,834 --> 00:55:45,597
What you waitin' for?

357
00:55:50,874 --> 00:55:53,638
Mr. Bernstein,

358
00:55:53,744 --> 00:55:57,111
why you come to America?

359
00:55:57,214 --> 00:56:00,809
You could've been teacher.

360
00:56:00,918 --> 00:56:03,682
Rabbi even.

361
00:56:05,289 --> 00:56:08,053
I wasn't worthy.

362
00:56:08,158 --> 00:56:11,252
What? I should live so!

363
00:56:13,364 --> 00:56:15,832
I could not take my mind

364
00:56:18,602 --> 00:56:20,069
from profanities.

365
00:56:26,877 --> 00:56:29,903
Here I was studying the Talmud

366
00:56:30,014 --> 00:56:32,346
which teaches

367
00:56:32,449 --> 00:56:37,113
"He who even looks at
the little finger of a woman

368
00:56:37,221 --> 00:56:42,386
is as guilty as though he looked
at a woman totally naked."

369
00:56:44,294 --> 00:56:47,991
So I bought a ship's ticket

370
00:56:48,098 --> 00:56:50,589
and I came to America.

371
00:57:36,847 --> 00:57:38,144
So?

372
00:57:49,426 --> 00:57:51,485
I'm tasting! That's all!

373
00:57:51,595 --> 00:57:54,257
I want a treat,
and you're insulting me.

374
00:57:54,364 --> 00:57:56,855
Who wants your treat?

375
00:57:56,967 --> 00:58:00,528
All right! So don't come
to my wedding neither.

376
00:58:05,642 --> 00:58:07,405
I'll be goddamn!

377
00:58:09,313 --> 00:58:13,010
Jake, was from you
I got the nerve to ask her.

378
00:58:13,117 --> 00:58:17,144
To have a wife,
that's a good thing, huh, Jake?

379
00:58:17,254 --> 00:58:19,722
What you talking, Joe?

380
00:58:19,823 --> 00:58:24,851
A single man is a bum, a gornisht!

381
00:58:26,163 --> 00:58:29,963
One thing, a man gives up something
when he gets married, by the way.

382
00:58:30,067 --> 00:58:32,592
What? Give up what?
Dancing school?

383
00:58:32,703 --> 00:58:34,762
A big mitzeah.

384
00:58:34,872 --> 00:58:37,067
Joe, what is?

385
00:58:37,174 --> 00:58:39,540
When I finish work, and I come home,

386
00:58:39,643 --> 00:58:44,103
all I wanna do is eat my dinner,
enjoy my little wife

387
00:58:44,214 --> 00:58:46,705
and play with my boychick.

388
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:53,717
Of course, Mamie and me,
we gonna run the academy together.

389
00:58:53,824 --> 00:58:55,883
Be good for business, huh?

390
00:59:00,097 --> 00:59:02,497
Mamie?

391
00:59:02,599 --> 00:59:04,658
Which Mamie?

392
00:59:04,768 --> 00:59:06,668
Mamie Fein.

393
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,708
You asked Mamie Fein, huh?

394
00:59:14,111 --> 00:59:15,908
What she say?

395
00:59:18,115 --> 00:59:19,742
"Maybe."

396
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:26,953
Maybe, huh? And already
you standing under the canopy.

397
00:59:27,057 --> 00:59:28,820
Upon my word.

398
00:59:28,926 --> 00:59:32,089
It's a good thing she didn't say
more than maybe. You can get away yet.

399
00:59:32,196 --> 00:59:35,859
Get away? I don't wanna get away.

400
00:59:38,001 --> 00:59:41,164
Jake, why should I wanna get away?

401
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,437
Never mind.

402
00:59:55,185 --> 01:00:00,452
American ladies,
for a good time, yes.

403
01:00:00,557 --> 01:00:03,617
For a wife, no.

404
01:00:05,395 --> 01:00:08,558
Get yourself a girl
from the old country.

405
01:00:08,665 --> 01:00:13,227
She don't ask all the time
for a new dress, a new hat.

406
01:00:13,337 --> 01:00:15,635
She don't run around
with other mens.

407
01:00:15,739 --> 01:00:20,199
She keeps the place like a fiddle,
and she knows how to save from a nickel.

408
01:00:20,310 --> 01:00:25,338
Mamie saved more than $300
from out her wages.

409
01:00:25,449 --> 01:00:29,545
Furthermore, I don't want
no greenhorn wife.

410
01:00:31,021 --> 01:00:33,182
Then you go to hell!

411
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:37,124
You and Mamie ain't worth
my wife's little finger!

412
01:00:37,227 --> 01:00:39,491
So.

413
01:00:39,596 --> 01:00:43,293
If your wife is such a wonder,
how is it you're sittin' here?

414
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:46,096
Never mind you business!

415
01:00:46,203 --> 01:00:48,694
You say one more word about my wife
and I'll give you this!

416
01:01:01,385 --> 01:01:02,943
You ain't got a cigar?

417
01:01:03,053 --> 01:01:05,749
Sure I got. Help yourself.
Take a couple.

418
01:01:05,856 --> 01:01:07,585
Thanks.

419
01:02:38,048 --> 01:02:40,881
Eat. Make your teeth strong.

420
01:02:49,826 --> 01:02:52,818
Look what a place is America,
nu, Bernstein?

421
01:02:53,630 --> 01:02:55,598
At home we had forests.

422
01:02:55,699 --> 01:02:58,691
Right outside the door,
remember, Yankel?

423
01:02:58,802 --> 01:03:02,932
Here one must take a train for an hour
just to be near a tree.

424
01:03:03,807 --> 01:03:05,866
So go back to Russia.

425
01:03:09,346 --> 01:03:12,838
Here a Jew is a mensch.

426
01:03:14,985 --> 01:03:20,082
In Russia we was afraid to walk
within ten feet of a Gentile.

427
01:03:20,190 --> 01:03:25,958
Yankel, where in America
is the Gentiles, huh?

428
01:03:26,997 --> 01:03:30,296
I go with Mrs. Kavarsky,
Rivington Street, Delancey Street,

429
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,334
everywhere Jews.

430
01:03:32,436 --> 01:03:34,734
The Gentiles keep
in another place, huh?

431
01:03:39,409 --> 01:03:43,812
Yossele, don't get dirty the knee pants
Ta'teh make for you.

432
01:03:43,914 --> 01:03:45,643
Let him enjoy!

433
01:03:49,386 --> 01:03:51,877
What a boy, with regular knee pants.

434
01:03:52,856 --> 01:03:55,416
You know what the trouble is
with you, Gitl?

435
01:03:57,994 --> 01:04:00,155
Look on me.

436
01:04:00,263 --> 01:04:02,424
Give a look on me!

437
01:04:02,532 --> 01:04:05,000
Am I a Jew or a Gentile?

438
01:04:05,101 --> 01:04:07,831
Forget that you know me.

439
01:04:07,938 --> 01:04:11,396
Just by what you see, what do you say?

440
01:04:12,409 --> 01:04:14,570
A Jew is a Jew.

441
01:04:15,912 --> 01:04:17,937
What do you know!

442
01:04:18,915 --> 01:04:21,611
Mr. Bernstein knows many things.

443
01:04:21,718 --> 01:04:25,279
He going give lessons
in how to talk English.

444
01:04:25,388 --> 01:04:29,552
I looking for students all the time.
Twenty-five cents an hour.

445
01:04:29,659 --> 01:04:33,151
I'll be goddamn!

446
01:04:33,263 --> 01:04:36,198
Who'd wanna take lessons
from such a greeny? Look at him!

447
01:04:38,301 --> 01:04:40,633
Bernstein,

448
01:04:41,905 --> 01:04:43,896
you want my advice?

449
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:52,505
Go to the shadchen,
say, „I’ll take what you got:

450
01:04:52,616 --> 01:04:56,985
deaf, hunchback,

451
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:59,647
long as she got money."

452
01:04:59,756 --> 01:05:03,192
Then you buy yourself a little store.

453
01:05:03,293 --> 01:05:05,284
Let the hunchback run the place.

454
01:05:05,395 --> 01:05:07,761
And you can sit all day
and read the books, huh?

455
01:05:07,864 --> 01:05:10,128
What do you say?

456
01:05:11,401 --> 01:05:13,995
Joey!

457
01:05:14,104 --> 01:05:15,969
Joey, come here!

458
01:05:31,054 --> 01:05:33,716
Don't bother, Mr. Bernstein.

459
01:07:44,054 --> 01:07:46,545
Oh, here he comes, Yossele.

460
01:07:48,091 --> 01:07:50,753
The slack season already?

461
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:53,624
Mister, wait one minute.
Yossele, stay by me.

462
01:07:53,730 --> 01:07:55,960
Go. I'll send him up in a minute.

463
01:08:08,044 --> 01:08:10,103
Slack season.

464
01:08:11,548 --> 01:08:15,143
No work three, maybe four months.

465
01:08:20,356 --> 01:08:22,449
Take off.

466
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:24,922
Take off!

467
01:08:25,028 --> 01:08:27,189
Yankel!

468
01:08:52,722 --> 01:08:54,622
What happened here?

469
01:08:55,558 --> 01:08:58,527
She looks like a wet cat!

470
01:09:02,866 --> 01:09:04,663
Mama!

471
01:09:04,768 --> 01:09:09,262
Take him to my house.
Have a little water.

472
01:09:13,042 --> 01:09:16,443
Another man would thank God
for such a wife.

473
01:09:16,546 --> 01:09:19,276
Look how she keeps the place.

474
01:09:19,382 --> 01:09:21,407
Like a mirror!

475
01:09:21,518 --> 01:09:24,146
A flower in the window even.

476
01:09:24,254 --> 01:09:26,313
Why do you do this to her?

477
01:09:26,422 --> 01:09:28,253
What I do?

478
01:09:32,762 --> 01:09:35,731
With one tochiss,
you can't dance at two weddings.

479
01:09:39,435 --> 01:09:41,995
You think you're better off
with the dancing girl?

480
01:09:48,578 --> 01:09:51,741
Gitl told you?
She didn't say a word, I swear.

481
01:09:54,417 --> 01:09:57,215
Don't get excited!
She didn't say a word!

482
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:01,814
I don't care for no dancing girls!

483
01:10:01,925 --> 01:10:03,722
I don't care for nobody!

484
01:10:03,827 --> 01:10:08,423
Especially that one,
that shnoosa!

485
01:10:08,531 --> 01:10:11,694
I'm an American fellow.

486
01:10:11,801 --> 01:10:14,292
A Yankee, that's what I am.
And that's all!

487
01:10:15,605 --> 01:10:17,402
Oh, it's no use.

488
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:28,441
Oh, kinder, kinder!
You have a quarrel and that's all.

489
01:10:28,551 --> 01:10:31,987
You make a peace.
Give a good kiss.

490
01:10:32,088 --> 01:10:35,922
What you kicking about anyway?
Mind your own business!

491
01:10:36,025 --> 01:10:37,583
Listen, Podkovnik,

492
01:10:37,694 --> 01:10:42,529
I was in this country when you were still in
Russia hauling on the bellows!

493
01:10:42,632 --> 01:10:46,159
You can't pee up my back,
and make me think it's rain.

494
01:10:46,269 --> 01:10:48,032
Get outta here!

495
01:10:48,137 --> 01:10:51,937
Never! Never! Go.
Who knows what you do! Maybe kill her.

496
01:10:52,041 --> 01:10:54,066
You wanna call a policeman? Go.

497
01:10:54,177 --> 01:10:58,307
Call a policeman! I will tell him
what is doing in this house!

498
01:11:05,922 --> 01:11:08,891
He will be back, that one.
Don't worry.

499
01:11:15,131 --> 01:11:17,463
I don't want him back.

500
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:22,165
Enough.

501
01:11:31,981 --> 01:11:34,472
Mamie, how can you fix?

502
01:11:34,584 --> 01:11:37,883
Gitl won't agree to divorce.

503
01:11:37,987 --> 01:11:40,353
Money. Money, money, money, money.

504
01:11:41,457 --> 01:11:43,322
I ain't got.

505
01:11:48,998 --> 01:11:50,693
I got.

506
01:11:53,836 --> 01:11:55,861
You got?

507
01:11:55,972 --> 01:11:59,601
You knew I got, didn't you?
Never!

508
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,675
How much you got?

509
01:12:09,385 --> 01:12:12,320
Three hundred and forty dollars.

510
01:12:12,422 --> 01:12:14,515
You little peach, you!

511
01:12:17,327 --> 01:12:22,424
Used to be 365,
but for the 25 you borrowed,

512
01:12:22,532 --> 01:12:25,467
I already said Kaddish.

513
01:12:25,568 --> 01:12:31,097
Ah. We'll keep by enough
to start a dancing academy.

514
01:12:31,207 --> 01:12:35,200
We're done in the sweatshops.
Finished.

515
01:12:38,514 --> 01:12:42,746
In the first, Podkovnik
will not come home no more

516
01:12:42,852 --> 01:12:45,514
whether you say yes or no, missus.

517
01:12:45,621 --> 01:12:48,454
Or as we say, „irregardless."

518
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:54,391
You agree to a divorce,

519
01:12:54,497 --> 01:12:58,433
Miss Mamie Fein is giving you $50.

520
01:13:07,143 --> 01:13:10,977
You don't agree, no $50.

521
01:13:21,724 --> 01:13:25,285
All right.

522
01:13:25,395 --> 01:13:28,193
You got a little one.

523
01:13:28,297 --> 01:13:30,060
Ach.

524
01:13:31,234 --> 01:13:33,702
Ach.

525
01:13:33,803 --> 01:13:35,828
What can I do?

526
01:13:35,938 --> 01:13:39,066
What can I do? What can I do?

527
01:13:41,778 --> 01:13:44,076
Seventy-five dollars.

528
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:49,117
Seventy-five dollars, you'll get
a new husband, one-two-three. Huh?

529
01:14:05,201 --> 01:14:07,669
What kind business we got here, missus?

530
01:14:10,807 --> 01:14:15,176
All right, $100.

531
01:14:15,278 --> 01:14:18,247
One hundred dollars!
What am I saying?

532
01:14:18,347 --> 01:14:20,975
It's out, I said it, that's all,
it's finished.

533
01:14:21,084 --> 01:14:24,850
One hundred dollars.
You're a rich lady. Mazeltov!

534
01:14:46,067 --> 01:14:48,092
Mr. Bernstein,

535
01:14:48,202 --> 01:14:50,397
is all right, these things?

536
01:14:52,273 --> 01:14:57,336
Mrs. Kavarsky say, for a divorce
a woman must not look like an old broom.

537
01:14:57,445 --> 01:15:00,005
So I go today by Delan--

538
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:07,854
You going away?

539
01:15:09,023 --> 01:15:11,389
I cannot pay my board.

540
01:15:11,492 --> 01:15:14,359
So I'll call a policeman.

541
01:15:15,897 --> 01:15:18,957
You got so much money now.
What do you need a boarder?

542
01:15:19,067 --> 01:15:21,558
I'm gonna stay by my uncle.

543
01:15:22,737 --> 01:15:24,534
When?

544
01:15:27,809 --> 01:15:29,674
Tonight.

545
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:33,772
Whatever.

546
01:15:37,585 --> 01:15:39,746
Missus?

547
01:15:45,293 --> 01:15:47,887
Maybe you got some string?

548
01:16:10,218 --> 01:16:12,311
Good-bye.

549
01:16:17,458 --> 01:16:19,255
Good-bye.

550
01:16:24,699 --> 01:16:26,894
And good-bye to the boy.

551
01:16:30,938 --> 01:16:34,203
May you have a boy
of your own one day.

552
01:16:39,681 --> 01:16:43,014
To have a son,

553
01:16:43,117 --> 01:16:45,711
a man must have a wife.

554
01:16:47,622 --> 01:16:50,216
A wife you can get.

555
01:16:51,459 --> 01:16:53,984
The one that I would ask,

556
01:16:58,166 --> 01:17:00,726
what if she would say no?

557
01:17:05,339 --> 01:17:08,035
What if she would say yes?

558
01:17:16,184 --> 01:17:19,415
Missus, what are you doing?

559
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:21,886
I'm saying yes.

560
01:17:23,057 --> 01:17:24,649
Thank you.

561
01:17:26,761 --> 01:17:28,626
You're welcome.

562
01:18:09,303 --> 01:18:10,702
Come in.

563
01:18:18,746 --> 01:18:21,374
You got the Rabbi's fee?

564
01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:26,078
All together. No installments.
We gotta eat too.

565
01:18:26,187 --> 01:18:27,984
I got, I got.

566
01:18:28,089 --> 01:18:30,990
The witnesses.
You got for them also?

567
01:18:33,694 --> 01:18:35,161
Zalman?

568
01:18:36,864 --> 01:18:38,456
My brother.

569
01:19:00,888 --> 01:19:04,051
What? Come.

570
01:19:15,403 --> 01:19:17,200
Over there.

571
01:19:43,231 --> 01:19:45,062
Jake.

572
01:19:47,735 --> 01:19:49,225
Yankel.

573
01:19:50,371 --> 01:19:52,202
Yankel.

574
01:19:55,710 --> 01:19:57,007
Berel.

575
01:19:57,912 --> 01:19:59,743
Berel.

576
01:21:36,944 --> 01:21:38,639
Yes.

577
01:23:55,149 --> 01:23:57,640
Zalman.

578
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:22,667
She's a good daughter of Israel, Rabbi.

579
01:24:22,776 --> 01:24:26,143
She could marry tomorrow,
but she will wait 91 days.

580
01:24:37,558 --> 01:24:40,891
She's got a suitor?

581
01:24:40,995 --> 01:24:44,226
Don't worry. When it comes to
the wedding, I'll call your husband.

582
01:24:44,331 --> 01:24:46,299
He'll make the ceremony.

583
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:47,958
Zalman.

584
01:24:49,336 --> 01:24:53,170
Why she shouldn't have a suitor,
such a beautiful young woman!

585
01:24:53,274 --> 01:24:55,265
Why she should go to waste?

586
01:24:55,376 --> 01:25:01,008
A yeshiva bocher,
not a lump of horse like the other one.

587
01:25:01,115 --> 01:25:04,414
He's already teaching her little one.

588
01:25:04,518 --> 01:25:08,147
A little one?

589
01:25:08,255 --> 01:25:10,621
So what's the name, the little one?

590
01:25:10,724 --> 01:25:13,750
Yossele.
Yossele.

591
01:25:13,861 --> 01:25:18,525
No. His name is Joey.

592
01:25:33,981 --> 01:25:36,677
So tomorrow you go by your boss,

593
01:25:36,784 --> 01:25:41,585
and tell him you'll stay
with the job, huh?

594
01:25:42,856 --> 01:25:44,824
What about
Podkovnik's Dancing Academy?

595
01:25:44,925 --> 01:25:46,984
Huh! With what?

596
01:25:47,094 --> 01:25:51,326
Your wife skinned us alive
out of $300, didn't she?

597
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:57,433
We'll have to start saving
all over again, from the very beginning.

598
01:26:05,079 --> 01:26:07,946
Mamie, must we walk
all the way to City Hall?

599
01:26:08,048 --> 01:26:10,141
Why spend for a carriage?

600
01:26:10,251 --> 01:26:13,152
But we can go by Third Avenue
and take the El.

601
01:26:13,254 --> 01:26:17,088
Two nickels is two nickels.
It's money, ain't it?

602
01:26:23,097 --> 01:26:26,533
Are you ashamed
for people to see us?

603
01:26:26,634 --> 01:26:31,333
Mamie! Come on, what you talking, huh?

604
01:26:39,847 --> 01:26:44,307
This grocery store,
how much rent is he asking?

605
01:26:44,418 --> 01:26:49,253
Don't bother your head. We got plenty left.
May I fall down on the street.

606
01:26:51,358 --> 01:26:54,054
You think I can learn
to sell groceries?

607
01:26:54,161 --> 01:26:57,392
What? You will study.
I will sell.

608
01:27:02,936 --> 01:27:05,928
Tell me, Mr. Bernstein,
in our store,

609
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:08,941
should we sell soda and seltzers?

610
01:27:09,043 --> 01:27:12,103
In the hot weather, people are thirsty.

611
01:27:12,212 --> 01:27:16,205
On the other hand, such an item
can be bought on the streets as well.

612
01:27:16,317 --> 01:27:17,841
That's true.

613
01:27:17,951 --> 01:27:22,479
So we mustn't be too quick
to say this or that.
