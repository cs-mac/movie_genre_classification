1
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,268
Let's go, let's go.

2
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:21,653
Ready for them?

3
00:02:22,044 --> 00:02:24,069
Rosie, open up.

4
00:02:27,382 --> 00:02:29,873
<i>Vamos. Afuera. Vamos.</i>

5
00:02:33,188 --> 00:02:34,985
Okay, let's go.

6
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:39,454
- Just give me five.
- What?

7
00:02:47,736 --> 00:02:49,455
What do you want me to do?

8
00:02:49,738 --> 00:02:51,222
Look, it's not my problem.

9
00:02:52,241 --> 00:02:56,666
All I'm asking, Stevens, is did the old man get seen to?

10
00:02:56,745 --> 00:03:00,870
He was sweating and shaking when I put him on the bus.
He said his arm felt numb.

11
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:02,940
Jesus Christ, Brogan.

12
00:03:03,018 --> 00:03:05,282
Everything is a humanitarian crisis with you.

13
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,992
You signed off on more orders of recognizance
than the rest of your unit combined.

14
00:03:10,993 --> 00:03:12,255
Don't give me that shit.

15
00:03:12,327 --> 00:03:16,192
The man's about to have a goddamn heart attack.
I want him seen to.

16
00:03:21,336 --> 00:03:22,103
Here he is.

17
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,162
Your guy was given a clean bill of health by Doc Sturgess.

18
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,401
He bused out three hours ago.
You happy now?

19
00:03:27,476 --> 00:03:30,104
Yeah, I'm happy now.

20
00:03:50,899 --> 00:03:55,129
Hey, Max, you're coming on Wednesday, right?
For my dad's nationalization party?

21
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:59,301
Max, it's an important thing in my culture
to make my father proud.

22
00:03:59,374 --> 00:04:01,137
You know they've been wanting to meet you.

23
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:04,539
I give you my word, they're not as scary
as I made them out to be, okay?

24
00:04:05,514 --> 00:04:10,441
- You better do it before they blow the lunch whistle.
- All right, let's go, compadres. Let's do it.

25
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:12,714
Get down!

26
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,247
- Over there.
- I got it. Sorry.

27
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:21,747
What you waiting for, Brogan?

28
00:05:21,824 --> 00:05:23,333
A marriage proposal?

29
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:25,359
Come on.

30
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,218
Come on.

31
00:05:35,237 --> 00:05:37,705
Hey, hey! Gene.

32
00:05:40,175 --> 00:05:41,233
I got her. Thanks.

33
00:05:56,558 --> 00:05:58,458
No, no, no.

34
00:05:58,527 --> 00:06:00,422
<i>No es posible.</i>

35
00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:19,976
<i>Muy bonita. You get her number?</i>

36
00:06:22,084 --> 00:06:23,333
I smell an O.R.

37
00:06:24,352 --> 00:06:27,912
Yeah, he's always giving the pretty ones a pass,
sometimes even the not-so-pretty ones.

38
00:06:29,836 --> 00:06:30,719
Okay?

39
00:06:31,455 --> 00:06:32,758
Now knock it the fuck off.

40
00:06:36,264 --> 00:06:39,722
[singing in Hebrew]

41
00:07:05,393 --> 00:07:10,264
Okay, everybody say, "Thank you, Mr. Kossef,
for singing that beautiful song."

42
00:07:10,332 --> 00:07:12,960
Thank you, Mr. Kossef.

43
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:25,044
- You know, that was actually a pretty tough crowd.
- Yeah.

44
00:07:25,313 --> 00:07:29,150
- Well, was I shit?
- No, actually.

45
00:07:29,351 --> 00:07:31,952
No, and for somebody who just learned the song last night,

46
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,614
- I thought you did a very good job.
- Oh, good.

47
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:39,560
- 'Cause I had absolutely no idea what I was singing about.
- Yeah.

48
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:42,429
- Oh, you could tell?
- Yeah, and also,

49
00:07:42,497 --> 00:07:44,795
please don't take this the wrong way,

50
00:07:44,866 --> 00:07:52,562
but what kind of Jew gets hired at a Jewish day school
who doesn't speak any Hebrew or even really,

51
00:07:52,563 --> 00:07:54,531
like, know the first thing about Judaism?

52
00:07:54,609 --> 00:07:58,101
Well, I guess, the atheist kind.

53
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,408
Excuse me?

54
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:00,293
No, I'm sorry.

55
00:08:00,294 --> 00:08:03,416
It's just... I just needed a job.

56
00:08:03,485 --> 00:08:08,293
And it was actually my manager's mom
is the principal of the school.

57
00:08:08,294 --> 00:08:09,294
Ah.

58
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,858
- You didn't completely suck.
- Oh, thank you.

59
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,606
I do not want you to say a word about this to anyone.

60
00:08:29,878 --> 00:08:31,612
I mean anyone.

61
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,466
- It could be very serious trouble for the school, and for me.
- No, I'm not gonna say anything.

62
00:08:37,577 --> 00:08:41,813
I want you to know I am only doing this because
of my son, because he says to me,

63
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,485
"Mom, Gavin is going to be an important musician."

64
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,460
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

65
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:51,226
Otherwise, I wouldn't do anything like this.

66
00:08:56,338 --> 00:09:00,206
Well, thank you. Thank you, Rachel.

67
00:09:00,275 --> 00:09:03,335
Honestly, I can't thank you enough.

68
00:09:18,994 --> 00:09:22,319
- She'll be right along, ma'am.
- Thank you.

69
00:09:41,483 --> 00:09:42,541
Oh.

70
00:09:47,022 --> 00:09:49,855
Mmm. Mmm.

71
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:53,357
Hold on just a second.

72
00:09:53,428 --> 00:09:55,862
Would you like to draw?

73
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,364
Here you go, honey.

74
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:00,628
I have something else for you this week, too.

75
00:10:03,505 --> 00:10:07,635
Your teacher, Madame Ntende, sent this to me in the mail.

76
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:11,245
She said that you lost it right before you left
and that you were really sad.

77
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:14,243
And she found it a few weeks ago.

78
00:10:25,294 --> 00:10:27,887
Honey, it's gonna be a little while longer,

79
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:32,296
and we are working very hard to find you a good mommy.

80
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:37,732
She won't ever replace your real mommy, but she will love you.

81
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:41,840
And I promise that she'll never leave you.

82
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,684
The men involved in this terrorist attack

83
00:10:50,752 --> 00:10:55,620
have been vilified, demonized, and condemned
by the Western world.

84
00:10:56,925 --> 00:11:01,453
But we never want to talk about the 9/11
Jihadists as real people.

85
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:07,060
The media and our leaders are quick to label them
as terrorists and monsters and murderers.

86
00:11:08,236 --> 00:11:11,262
But shouldn't we try to understand them as human beings?

87
00:11:12,111 --> 00:11:12,906
Fuck, no.

88
00:11:14,376 --> 00:11:22,107
Everybody calls them cowards for murdering helpless passengers
and causing the deaths of thousands of innocent lives.

89
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:24,242
- What would you call them?
- Hey.

90
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:26,314
It's the truth.

91
00:11:26,588 --> 00:11:31,666
But cowards do not knowingly sacrifice
themselves for a greater cause.

92
00:11:31,994 --> 00:11:34,128
- I don't agree at all.
- The cause is to kill us?

93
00:11:36,231 --> 00:11:40,122
- You may not agree with their cause...
- I don't understand why she's up there.

94
00:11:40,335 --> 00:11:46,035
But I do not believe their actions were
either cowardly or irrational.

95
00:11:46,107 --> 00:11:49,200
- You know you don't want to hear this shit, Ms. B.
- She's talking.

96
00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:55,680
I feel that, like the oppressed Palestinian
people, or the Iraqi citizens

97
00:11:56,084 --> 00:12:00,860
under occupation in their own homeland,
that they found themselves without a voice.

98
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:02,722
Hey.

99
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:08,609
And that the only way for them to be heard is
to scream with the might of tons of steel

100
00:12:08,696 --> 00:12:14,363
- and thunderous jet engines behind them upon impact.
- Okay, okay.

101
00:12:15,306 --> 00:12:17,303
Their voices were heard.

102
00:12:17,372 --> 00:12:22,308
You may not like what they had to say or
how they got their message across,

103
00:12:22,377 --> 00:12:24,675
but for the first time, we heard it.

104
00:12:24,746 --> 00:12:26,509
We gotta listen to this shit?

105
00:12:26,581 --> 00:12:28,742
- What we heard was a cry for justice.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

106
00:12:28,817 --> 00:12:32,253
Okay, okay. Yes, thank you.

107
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,083
Hey, Ms. B., thank you.

108
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:38,614
I am... I am not sure that that was the point of
the assignment, Taslima,

109
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,023
but, uh, yes, it was certainly thought-provoking.

110
00:12:42,397 --> 00:12:44,297
- Bullshit.
- Yeah, bullshit.

111
00:12:44,365 --> 00:12:45,389
You can sit down now.

112
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,661
College is hungry for her.

113
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:48,031
Fucking traitor.

114
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:49,626
Crybaby.

115
00:12:49,704 --> 00:12:53,025
Why don't you get the fuck out of our country and
go back to camel-humping Saudi Arabia,

116
00:12:53,026 --> 00:12:56,037
- where the fuck you camel-humpers live.
- Brian. Brian.

117
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:00,240
I know you're upset, but I'm not going
to condone an outburst like that.

118
00:13:00,315 --> 00:13:03,341
Yo, what's your name? Taslima bin Laden?

119
00:13:03,418 --> 00:13:05,550
Hey, yo, I just got one question, Ms. B.

120
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:09,950
Did you frisk her? What if the bitch be strapped
with dynamite or TNT or something?

121
00:13:10,024 --> 00:13:11,787
She going to get a grenade!

122
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,851
- Yo, take us all out.
- Boom!

123
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:15,088
Marcus!

124
00:13:32,213 --> 00:13:33,976
Sure, I'm up for that.

125
00:13:34,048 --> 00:13:35,811
Oh, shit, it's my brother.

126
00:13:37,886 --> 00:13:39,319
Hey.

127
00:13:39,587 --> 00:13:42,986
I thought I told you not to come.
Javier's giving me a ride home.

128
00:13:43,057 --> 00:13:44,615
It's on my way.

129
00:13:46,194 --> 00:13:48,248
I just need five minutes to finish up.
I'm in the middle of an order.

130
00:13:48,249 --> 00:13:52,999
- Look at you. Cover yourself up.
- Just go.

131
00:13:54,903 --> 00:13:56,628
I'll meet you in the car.

132
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:58,672
Please.

133
00:14:10,685 --> 00:14:12,812
- Um, Heavy-eye?
- Javier.

134
00:14:12,887 --> 00:14:15,447
Hi, I'm Claire. We spoke on the phone, remember?

135
00:14:15,523 --> 00:14:18,151
- Right. Yeah.
- Okay.

136
00:14:21,696 --> 00:14:23,254
Is that okay?

137
00:14:23,331 --> 00:14:25,026
Yeah, it's good. Come back on Friday.

138
00:14:25,099 --> 00:14:26,111
Friday.

139
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,481
- Is that the soonest?
- Yeah.

140
00:14:30,071 --> 00:14:33,407
Okay. See you Friday. Okay.

141
00:14:54,663 --> 00:14:56,454
He's lying. I did it last night.

142
00:15:13,982 --> 00:15:18,785
- Oh, mama's boy taking out garbage.
- Who made you the bitch of the family?

143
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:21,514
- You got no sister to do your grunt work?
- We take turn.

144
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:23,454
You gotta keep that shit under control, motherfucker.

145
00:15:23,524 --> 00:15:26,721
Tomo. Let's hit it.

146
00:15:29,864 --> 00:15:31,097
Where to?

147
00:15:32,934 --> 00:15:34,045
Damn.

148
00:15:35,403 --> 00:15:37,371
Oh, shit, I got this little Glock, homie.

149
00:15:37,438 --> 00:15:40,074
Okay, check it out. Wan's uncle's into him for 50 large.

150
00:15:40,275 --> 00:15:44,011
Pays out on Saturdays, gets the cash in the store
Friday night right before closing.

151
00:15:44,788 --> 00:15:46,444
We're gonna roll by and scope it out.

152
00:15:47,782 --> 00:15:50,999
- Yeah, you the bitch.
- Give Yong the Ruger. Sweet gat, yo.

153
00:15:51,552 --> 00:15:53,713
Tell me this don't make your little chachi hard.

154
00:15:53,788 --> 00:15:56,333
- Pussy.
- Yong, you're gonna pop your cherry, fool.

155
00:15:56,334 --> 00:15:58,016
- That's right, man.
- You up for that, Yong?

156
00:15:58,092 --> 00:15:59,650
Better be, homie.

157
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:09,888
<i>By sunbathing, crocodiles accelerate
the chemical reactions in their bodies.</i>

158
00:16:14,676 --> 00:16:16,940
<i>Once the croc is up to speed...</i>

159
00:16:45,373 --> 00:16:50,565
No, I don't know her name.
I'll recognize her when I see her.

160
00:16:53,255 --> 00:16:55,205
Yes. Andasol Fabrics.

161
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:04,053
I'm gonna come down and have her released on an O.R.
She's got a minor child left unattended.

162
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:09,841
Are you sure?

163
00:17:11,466 --> 00:17:13,364
How long ago did they bus out?

164
00:17:14,335 --> 00:17:15,268
Wait, wait, wait.

165
00:17:15,337 --> 00:17:17,777
Did anybody from Children's Services see her?

166
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:22,466
Yeah. Okay.

167
00:17:22,743 --> 00:17:24,076
Thank you.

168
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,011
Fuck it.

169
00:18:13,027 --> 00:18:16,422

Whoo!

182
00:18:54,302 --> 00:18:55,735
Whoo!

183
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,650
- That was great.
- Thank you. I'm done.

184
00:19:00,007 --> 00:19:02,301
Glad you came.
So how was your class?

185
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:05,810
- What?
- I got a recurring role on The D'Angelos.

186
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,873
- You got a part? Are you serious?
- Bitch.

187
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:10,415
- You did? You got a part?
- I know, it's unbelievable.

188
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,952
Oh, fuck. That's a big deal, babe.
It's big news.

189
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,285
- Yeah.
- We should get a drink.

190
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,479
I'll get it.

191
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,222
Thanks, babe.

192
00:19:19,327 --> 00:19:20,888
So how did you pull it off?

193
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:24,495
I don't know. I mean the casting director knows my situation.

194
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:28,558
She's given me until Friday to get my l-9 in.

195
00:19:28,636 --> 00:19:32,299
So there's a fellow I met through someone at Crunch.

196
00:19:32,373 --> 00:19:34,864
He works at one of those photocopying stores on Fountain.

197
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:37,174
Come on, no, no, no.
You can't do that.

198
00:19:37,345 --> 00:19:41,566
If you get caught with a fake green card,
you could be done for fraud.

199
00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:46,385
It's no different from photoshopping your Social Security
card to remove the "Not for Employment" stamp.

200
00:19:46,754 --> 00:19:50,783
Or passing yourself off as a religious Jew
when you're an atheist, like, an actual atheist.

201
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:53,452
- Come home with me.
- What?

202
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:55,133
I'm serious. Come home with me.

203
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,759
It's not practical. You know that.

204
00:19:58,232 --> 00:20:01,198
You know we can't make a go of it without status.

205
00:20:01,969 --> 00:20:03,837
I've gotta get legal, and so do you.

206
00:20:03,905 --> 00:20:05,668
You've got to get legal.
You know that.

207
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:08,420
I'm working on that, all right?
I just want to know where this guy is.

208
00:20:08,476 --> 00:20:11,899
Your Captain America who's gonna come down
he's gonna sweep you off your feet,

209
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,719
he's gonna marry you, he's gonna make you legit.

210
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,650
- Isn't that what you're looking for?
- Captain America?

211
00:20:15,651 --> 00:20:18,341
I just wonder what's taking you so long.

212
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,148
Here you go.

213
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:25,555
- Thanks, babe.
- Yeah, listen, I gotta go.

214
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,685
I gotta go. It was a real pleasure meeting you...

215
00:20:27,762 --> 00:20:28,777
- Rose.
- Rose.

216
00:20:29,111 --> 00:20:32,535
Yeah, just give me an email when your TV thing comes out.

217
00:20:32,736 --> 00:20:35,129
Gavin, I'll see you...

218
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,536
before. You know?

219
00:20:37,805 --> 00:20:39,900
Yeah. Yeah, maybe.

220
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,681
She owes me money for the week.

221
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:34,227
What are you doing, negotiating with me?

222
00:21:34,495 --> 00:21:37,111
Is that what you think you're doing?

223
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:42,888
- How much?
- $50.

224
00:21:52,913 --> 00:21:56,246
If it's not the right kid, I'm coming back.

225
00:22:11,298 --> 00:22:13,666
- What's his name?
- Juan.

226
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:16,566
Juan Sanchez.

227
00:22:32,586 --> 00:22:33,697
Thanks, pal.

228
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:07,977
I need a reverse I.D. on a Tijuana number.

229
00:23:07,855 --> 00:23:15,119
Let's see. It is 661-555-7782.

230
00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:19,000
Appreciate it.

231
00:23:27,007 --> 00:23:31,355
Oh, I think it's this goddamn stomach flu that's going around.
I've been throwing up all morning.

232
00:23:31,512 --> 00:23:34,709
Well, let them know I'll call in later tomorrow.

233
00:23:45,226 --> 00:23:47,222
Okay, let's go.

234
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:03,776
Uh, I'm not finding any record of your l-539 in our system.

235
00:24:03,844 --> 00:24:05,709
You said you sent it in six weeks ago?

236
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:09,065
- Eight. Eight weeks ago.
- Okay. Well, do you have a mailing receipt?

237
00:24:09,066 --> 00:24:12,708
No, because I just copied my l-94 and sent it by regular mail.

238
00:24:12,709 --> 00:24:15,887
Okay, well, then how about a cancelled
check for the application fee?

239
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:20,023
Um, well, I paid by money order.
I don't have a checkbook.

240
00:24:20,094 --> 00:24:22,119
I didn't get a receipt for my money order.

241
00:24:22,196 --> 00:24:26,777
- Listen, I'm starting to get a little concerned here...
- Ma'am, you are not out of status

242
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:32,660
until you receive a decision on your extension application.
However, if that application is lost in the system

243
00:24:32,661 --> 00:24:35,819
or for whatever reason it doesn't get to us,
then how are we supposed to know

244
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,222
that you even sent it in in the first place?

245
00:24:38,224 --> 00:24:43,730
From our perspective, with no mailing receipt or cancelled
money order, you're out of status, unless...

246
00:24:43,784 --> 00:24:46,685
My application just turns up.

247
00:25:01,201 --> 00:25:03,800
Son of a bitch.

248
00:25:05,673 --> 00:25:07,903
Fuck. It's a brand-new fucking car.

249
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,510
Sorry, didn't l...

250
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,700
I didn't have time to stop.
You just shot out like that.

251
00:25:16,684 --> 00:25:19,747
- I signaled, didn't I?
- No, and even if you did,

252
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,015
it's supposed to be clear before you turn into the street.

253
00:25:22,016 --> 00:25:23,127
You okay?

254
00:25:24,358 --> 00:25:25,469
Yeah.

255
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:27,516
Yeah? You look dazed.

256
00:25:27,595 --> 00:25:28,905
- No.
- Do you need to sit down?

257
00:25:28,906 --> 00:25:29,739
Does it hurt anywhere?

258
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,086
- No, no, no, no, no.
- You sure?

259
00:25:31,087 --> 00:25:35,444
Yeah, I'm all right, I think.
I've just had a really, really shitty day.

260
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,477
- Where you from, New Zealand?
- Australia.

261
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,777
It's always one or the other.
I can never quite tell the difference.

262
00:25:42,343 --> 00:25:44,308
I said New Zealand to impress you in case I was right.

263
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,690
Most people usually say Australia, which upsets the Kiwis.

264
00:25:48,983 --> 00:25:53,052
I don't have the money to pay for this.
I'm not insured on my car.

265
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:54,987
Ouch. That's not good.

266
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:59,999
I must have fucked someone over really badly in a past life
because shit is just piling up for me today.

267
00:26:00,127 --> 00:26:02,873
I just spent the last three hours in there trying
to convince some bureaucratic bitch

268
00:26:02,874 --> 00:26:06,123
that I actually did file for an extension on my visitor's visa.

269
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,233
Which I fucking did.

270
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:11,642
- What's your name?
- I'm sorry. I'm Claire Shepard.

271
00:26:11,643 --> 00:26:12,813
Claire Shepard, I'm Cole Frankel,

272
00:26:12,814 --> 00:26:15,280
- and I know of your frustrations.
- You do?

273
00:26:15,276 --> 00:26:18,440
I'm a supervisory center adjudications officer.

274
00:26:18,512 --> 00:26:22,666
What that means is I get to determine whether
a green card application has merit or not.

275
00:26:24,952 --> 00:26:27,011
Ah, that must be interesting.

276
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:28,714
Yeah, I'll tell you what's interesting,

277
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:32,755
and what's of a bit of concern to me,
aside from you not having insurance,

278
00:26:32,756 --> 00:26:35,700
and that's someone who's filing for an
extension of their visitor's visa

279
00:26:35,701 --> 00:26:37,694
driving around with a stack of head shots in her car.

280
00:26:38,702 --> 00:26:43,333
There's nothing wrong with a beautiful woman like yourself
having head shots in her car if you were back in Australia.

281
00:26:44,171 --> 00:26:47,777
You're not authorized to be seeking
employment in the United States, Claire.

282
00:26:49,543 --> 00:26:51,099
Am I wrong about that?

283
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,270
All right, here's what I propose.

284
00:26:54,748 --> 00:26:56,646
We call AAA... my card, of course.

285
00:26:56,717 --> 00:26:59,208
If you don't have insurance,
you sure as hell don't have AAA.

286
00:26:59,286 --> 00:27:02,555
Then we get your vehicle sorted out.
Then we go grab some lunch together.

287
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,557
Excuse me?

288
00:27:05,626 --> 00:27:08,293
I want to buy you lunch, Claire,
and explain your options to you.

289
00:27:09,063 --> 00:27:12,444
or we could just take a walk back into the
building and sort it out there.

290
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,048
Juanito! Juanito!

291
00:28:43,123 --> 00:28:44,613
Juanito! Juanito!

292
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:50,495
Gracias, Señor.

293
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:11,855
Sanchez. Mireya.

294
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:13,230
24.

295
00:29:14,855 --> 00:29:17,411
It would be last night or early this morning.

296
00:29:19,692 --> 00:29:20,825
You positive?

297
00:29:22,234 --> 00:29:24,021
Yeah, okay. Thanks.

298
00:29:29,736 --> 00:29:31,299
That's a great show.

299
00:29:31,522 --> 00:29:33,300
Nothing can touch that on TV.

300
00:29:33,401 --> 00:29:35,855
I thought you said you wanted to discuss my situation.

301
00:29:36,499 --> 00:29:37,610
All right.

302
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,517
Here's the thing, Claire.

303
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:44,616
You want to be an actress like Nicole and Naomi, obviously.

304
00:29:44,885 --> 00:29:49,188
You know as well as I do the work they do in
Australia doesn't count for shit.

305
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:52,787
They're stars because they make movies here in America.

306
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,589
If you were to get deported, or even chose voluntary departure,

307
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:58,930
you ain't getting back into this country
for a minimum of ten years.

308
00:30:00,468 --> 00:30:05,299
And with voluntary departure, they say it's closer to five,
but the truth is, you're lucky if you ever get back in.

309
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:08,855
- What's your wife do?
- She works for the other side.

310
00:30:08,856 --> 00:30:11,633
- She's an immigration defense attorney.
- Oh. Is she available for a consult?

311
00:30:14,866 --> 00:30:15,977
That's funny.

312
00:30:17,684 --> 00:30:21,522
Sexy, great sense of humor.
You got it all, Claire.

313
00:30:21,922 --> 00:30:23,300
Except for a work permit.

314
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:28,675
I don't think you'll feel so witty when they introduce
you to a holding cell down in San Pedro.

315
00:30:28,676 --> 00:30:30,411
Strip-search, the whole bit.

316
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,744
Some mama Latina makes you her bitch for a couple nights.

317
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:36,966
All right. You've made your point.

318
00:30:39,673 --> 00:30:41,522
So where would you like to do it?

319
00:31:03,188 --> 00:31:05,020
You're goddamn amazing.

320
00:31:06,888 --> 00:31:09,188
You really are...

321
00:31:10,003 --> 00:31:12,522
a perfect little fuck machine.

322
00:31:14,507 --> 00:31:15,997
Without a green card.

323
00:31:19,855 --> 00:31:22,475
Well, maybe we could do something about that.

324
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,966
You can get me a green card?

325
00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:27,910
I can't just manufacture one for you.

326
00:31:28,855 --> 00:31:32,300
I'm not in the counterfeiting business.

327
00:31:33,026 --> 00:31:38,363
But I can have your file and application,
which would conveniently land on my desk,

328
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:45,077
and regardless of the merits of that application,
it would be approved.

329
00:31:45,644 --> 00:31:47,855
You could really pull that off?

330
00:31:48,322 --> 00:31:50,138
Like, on what grounds?

331
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:56,088
- You're a recognized TV star in Australia, Claire.
- I'm bloody well not. I'm not even close.

332
00:31:56,089 --> 00:31:58,077
I don't know that.

333
00:31:59,453 --> 00:32:01,299
And no one else does.

334
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:11,550
You fabricate some credits, a few, uh, Aussie awards,
some bullshit testimonials.

335
00:32:11,865 --> 00:32:13,633
And I make it fly.

336
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,522
It's called an EB-1.

337
00:32:15,523 --> 00:32:18,411
It's a green card for persons of extraordinary ability.

338
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,363
Are you jerking me around?

339
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,971
Or is this real?

340
00:32:24,855 --> 00:32:27,866
- Because if you can make this happen for me...
- You'd make it worth my while.

341
00:32:27,867 --> 00:32:28,978
Mm-hmm.

342
00:32:29,716 --> 00:32:32,522
- For two weeks.
- For a green card?

343
00:32:33,755 --> 00:32:36,011
Six months, baby.

344
00:32:36,012 --> 00:32:38,300
I don't think so.

345
00:32:39,711 --> 00:32:42,240
- One month.
- Three months.

346
00:32:42,395 --> 00:32:43,506
Two months

347
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:46,735
and you get me approved up front, all right?

348
00:32:46,736 --> 00:32:49,522
You can hold on to the paperwork, but I want to see it.
I want to know that it's real.

349
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,871
Done.

350
00:32:51,294 --> 00:32:53,299
But you're on the clock from tomorrow.

351
00:32:53,744 --> 00:32:56,899
I call, and you get your ass over to
whatever address I give you.

352
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:02,010
All right.

353
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,430
So you through with me for the day?
Can I go grab a shower?

354
00:33:04,431 --> 00:33:05,542
No, wait.

355
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,188
I got one more favor to ask of you, Claire.

356
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,633
I want you down on all fours at the edge of the bed.

357
00:33:29,122 --> 00:33:30,300
You ain't got that yet?

358
00:33:30,544 --> 00:33:32,633
- You cheated today.
- Check it out, yo.

359
00:33:33,313 --> 00:33:34,780
Wait, wait, wait.

360
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:35,848
- You gonna talk to her, dude?

361
00:33:36,211 --> 00:33:38,447
- Taslima. Taslima!
- Oh, God.

362
00:33:40,153 --> 00:33:41,855
It's the sand-nigger express.

363
00:33:41,856 --> 00:33:44,522
Raghead chick can hide her face and
nobody even know she butt-ugly.

364
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,734
Hey, maybe you can get your sister to convert or something, A.Z.

365
00:33:46,735 --> 00:33:47,846
Shut up.

366
00:33:51,631 --> 00:33:53,042
Ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff!

367
00:33:55,944 --> 00:33:57,188
Put on your belt.

368
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,650
No.

369
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,966
Immigration Customs Enforcement.
Open the door.

370
00:34:22,395 --> 00:34:23,400
What is this about?

371
00:34:23,401 --> 00:34:24,755
Federal agents.
Open the door, please.

372
00:34:24,856 --> 00:34:26,167
We have a warrant.

373
00:34:31,644 --> 00:34:33,633
- Hands against the wall, please.
- Hands against the wall.

374
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,188
What is this?

375
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:37,050
Why is the FBI here?

376
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,966
Relax, sir. Put your hands behind your back.

377
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,522
Are you Taslima Jahangir?

378
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,580
I'm Special Agent Phadkar.

379
00:34:51,004 --> 00:34:52,560
Will you show me to your bedroom, please?

380
00:34:56,522 --> 00:34:58,634
I don't understand what this is about.

381
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:00,477
Did you write this?

382
00:35:01,301 --> 00:35:02,499
Why do you have it?

383
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,833
It was brought to our attention by the principal of your school.

384
00:35:05,205 --> 00:35:06,720
He was troubled by the position you took.

385
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:09,980
I thought there was something like
freedom of speech in this country.

386
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:12,790
You essay elicits sympathy for the 9/11 hijackers,

387
00:35:13,301 --> 00:35:16,188
- suggests you feel their cause was just.
- That's not what I wrote.

388
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:20,560
I wrote that I understand why they did what they did.
I didn't write that I support it.

389
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,800
Do you? Support their actions?

390
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:27,360
I understand their need to be heard.

391
00:35:28,929 --> 00:35:31,522
I don't think they went about it in the right way.

392
00:35:31,397 --> 00:35:32,508
Agent Phadkar.

393
00:35:42,075 --> 00:35:43,633
Do you have an interest in suicide?

394
00:35:44,311 --> 00:35:45,633
Your diary suggests you do.

395
00:35:47,781 --> 00:35:48,992
That's not...

396
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:56,616
Those are notes on a class paper on
why religions oppose suicide.

397
00:35:57,624 --> 00:35:59,199
And you're not opposed to it?

398
00:35:59,259 --> 00:36:02,852
I wouldn't become a suicide bomber, if that's what you mean.

399
00:36:02,853 --> 00:36:05,855
But you condone suicide bombing as a legitimate
means to make a statement?

400
00:36:06,311 --> 00:36:07,493
That's what you wrote in your essay.

401
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,700
You're twisting my words.
That's not what I wrote.

402
00:36:11,232 --> 00:36:12,966
Well, reads that way to me.

403
00:36:14,574 --> 00:36:17,407
"Upon impact, their voices were finally heard.

404
00:36:17,477 --> 00:36:21,063
You may not like what they had to say or how they
got their message across, but we heard it.

405
00:36:21,064 --> 00:36:23,974
For the first time, we heard it."

406
00:36:24,551 --> 00:36:26,940
I was just saying that they got our attention

407
00:36:27,744 --> 00:36:32,750
and that maybe we should understand why
they did what they did. That's all.

408
00:36:32,752 --> 00:36:36,871
So if someone's pissed off at America,
they should hijack and fly planes into our buildings.

409
00:36:37,474 --> 00:36:39,391
That seems like a reasonable thing to do.

410
00:36:39,392 --> 00:36:41,490
Agent Phadkar, over here.

411
00:36:43,636 --> 00:36:44,759
Take a look at this.

412
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,900
She has a World of Islam account.

413
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,970
She's been frequenting some interesting chatrooms.

414
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,371
Global Jihad,

415
00:36:53,346 --> 00:36:55,188
Jihad Talking Points.

416
00:36:56,249 --> 00:37:00,220
I'm interested in all Muslim points of view.
It keeps me informed.

417
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:04,100
Taslima, your parents are in the United States illegally.

418
00:37:05,492 --> 00:37:10,020
My brother and sister were born here.
They're American citizens.

419
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,541
True.

420
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,200
But you and your parents are not.

421
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,520
When your brother and sister reach the age of 21,

422
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,464
they're entitled to petition for your
parents to enter this country.

423
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,966
Until then, your family has no status.

424
00:37:25,044 --> 00:37:26,590
Listen to me, Taslima.

425
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:28,855
Here's what I'm willing to do for you.

426
00:37:30,283 --> 00:37:32,400
I'm not interested in detaining your family.

427
00:37:32,852 --> 00:37:34,578
But I'd like to talk to you further.

428
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:39,960
Immigration and Customs Enforcement has every
right to take your family into custody,

429
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:45,080
but if you leave with us now and cooperate with us,
Immigration won't detain them.

430
00:37:45,632 --> 00:37:49,400
They'll still have to resolve their status, but nobody's
looking to make an issue of that right now.

431
00:37:50,655 --> 00:37:51,766
You understand?

432
00:38:19,966 --> 00:38:22,162
Mr. Max, welcome to my home.

433
00:38:22,163 --> 00:38:24,812
- Thank you.
- You honor me with your presence tonight.

434
00:38:24,813 --> 00:38:26,580
- Thank you.
- This is my wife.

435
00:38:26,581 --> 00:38:28,500
Very nice to meet you. Welcome.

436
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,632
Thank you. You have a beautiful home.

437
00:38:30,677 --> 00:38:31,511
Thank you.

438
00:38:31,858 --> 00:38:34,469
- Congratulations, sir, on your naturalization.
- Thank you.

439
00:38:35,116 --> 00:38:40,866
Farid. Come over here. Come and meet an important gentleman.

440
00:38:40,867 --> 00:38:43,585
- He's my youngest son. He's a lawyer.
- Ah.

441
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,781
- How do you do?
- How are you?

442
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:47,950
- It's a pleasure.
- Hi. How are you?

443
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,373
This is Max. He is the partner of Hamid.

444
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:54,633
You show him the respect, or he will have you deported.

445
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,155
He can't deport me, Baba.
I've already been naturalized.

446
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,522
You're the only person in this house who can be deported.

447
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,199
Until Saturday.
Then he becomes one of us.

448
00:39:04,411 --> 00:39:07,188
Excuse me. I'm gonna go put her down.
It was good to meet you.

449
00:39:07,222 --> 00:39:08,966
- Thank you.
- Okay, come on.

450
00:39:11,551 --> 00:39:16,188
Hey, Max, I'm so glad you made it tonight.
I really appreciate it.

451
00:39:16,956 --> 00:39:19,855
- Get you a drink?
- Yeah, Scotch rocks, please.

452
00:39:30,966 --> 00:39:32,633
Hey, guys, what are you doing?

453
00:39:38,478 --> 00:39:39,473
Inside.

454
00:39:42,148 --> 00:39:43,522
My sister should not have come here tonight.

455
00:39:43,999 --> 00:39:46,966
- What's going on there?
- She puts herself before the family.

456
00:39:47,065 --> 00:39:49,188
She shouldn't expect to be welcome around here.

457
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,501
Baba.

458
00:39:54,877 --> 00:39:58,486
So, Max. Hamid speaks so highly of you.

459
00:39:58,865 --> 00:40:00,163
He looks up to you.

460
00:40:00,522 --> 00:40:03,744
Never understood why he joined the immigration Gestapo.

461
00:40:03,903 --> 00:40:06,966
I think that deep down inside he doesn't feel like he belongs.

462
00:40:06,968 --> 00:40:11,754
I mean, what better way to prove you're red, white, and blue
than by throwing out those who also don't belong?

463
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,855
- You're a lawyer, huh?
- I'm a junior partner at Berkhof, Mazolo, and Klein.

464
00:40:16,316 --> 00:40:20,050
Specialize in personal injury.
We have 35 lawyers under us.

465
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:22,966
- You're an ambulance chaser.
- I don't chase anyone.

466
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,855
I turn clients away.

467
00:40:27,755 --> 00:40:28,866
Excuse me.

468
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:40,805
You have another one of those?

469
00:40:45,512 --> 00:40:47,720
Max Brogan. I work with Hamid.

470
00:40:49,382 --> 00:40:50,400
I know who you are.

471
00:40:59,592 --> 00:41:00,803
Thank you.

472
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,960
What does that say on your bracelet?

473
00:41:04,764 --> 00:41:06,222
"Little angel."

474
00:41:07,755 --> 00:41:09,572
My father gave it to me when I was 12.

475
00:41:15,575 --> 00:41:17,777
You realize that they're staring at us.

476
00:41:18,845 --> 00:41:22,522
Very disapproving looks you're getting
for consorting with the outcast.

477
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,891
I'll risk it.

478
00:41:29,922 --> 00:41:32,115
I've never been invited to a shunning before.

479
00:41:32,116 --> 00:41:34,299
What is this? Something you guys brought over with you?

480
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,931
I didn't bring it.

481
00:41:36,496 --> 00:41:37,818
I was born here.

482
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,100
I'm the only one in this family who's an actual American.

483
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:48,411
Probably decided to naturalize.
Makes 'em every bit as American as you.

484
00:41:51,855 --> 00:41:53,633
Let me tell you about my father.

485
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,199
The great American-to-be.

486
00:41:57,766 --> 00:42:00,300
He was always critical of the Shah.

487
00:42:00,987 --> 00:42:05,411
But after the revolution, one of his business rivals
spread rumors that he was anti-Khomeini.

488
00:42:06,092 --> 00:42:09,077
And the whole family had to flee across the border to Turkey.

489
00:42:10,763 --> 00:42:13,299
He spent most of his savings trying to get everybody over here.

490
00:42:17,069 --> 00:42:19,778
But see, he doesn't pine for the days of the Shah.

491
00:42:21,006 --> 00:42:26,199
And I think he'd be perfectly content in that fucked-up
Islamic shithole that that country is today.

492
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,966
Which is why he resents every day he spends here.

493
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:31,761
Well, he could go back.

494
00:42:32,522 --> 00:42:34,280
He's too old to start over.

495
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,300
So what's your story?

496
00:42:37,156 --> 00:42:38,077
Any family?

497
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,188
I have a daughter.

498
00:42:43,462 --> 00:42:45,188
I'm not with her mother anymore.

499
00:42:45,698 --> 00:42:46,809
How old is she?

500
00:42:47,434 --> 00:42:48,545
26.

501
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,269
Uh... no.

502
00:42:52,438 --> 00:42:53,549
27.

503
00:42:54,573 --> 00:42:56,760
You better get that straight, or you might piss her off.

504
00:42:57,944 --> 00:42:59,522
I think I did that already.

505
00:43:01,533 --> 00:43:04,562
Max, my father's asking for you.

506
00:43:06,786 --> 00:43:10,077
- It was nice meeting you, Max.
- You, too.

507
00:43:10,089 --> 00:43:11,482
I'm out of here.

508
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,411
Got a date.

509
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:16,924
Got a real hot date, Max.

510
00:43:19,465 --> 00:43:21,726
Ignore her. She's crazy.

511
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:24,531
I'm tired, Hamid.

512
00:43:24,804 --> 00:43:26,088
I'm gonna go home.

513
00:43:28,141 --> 00:43:29,352
Max.

514
00:43:29,876 --> 00:43:30,865
My father.

515
00:43:32,386 --> 00:43:33,500
See you tomorrow.

516
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,950
Tell your family thanks for me, okay?

517
00:43:44,991 --> 00:43:47,702
You know what she said to the Yoruban interpreter today?

518
00:43:48,461 --> 00:43:50,121
"Are you my mommy?"

519
00:43:51,097 --> 00:43:54,458
The interpreter says she's losing her
ability to speak the language.

520
00:43:55,201 --> 00:44:00,090
It's 23 months that she's been in there.
23 fucking months.

521
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,660
I feel gutted every time I go.

522
00:44:04,644 --> 00:44:06,966
Ah, it's a shitty situation.

523
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:09,699
But you can't keep beating yourself up over it.

524
00:44:12,752 --> 00:44:13,933
I was thinking...

525
00:44:16,122 --> 00:44:17,714
we could maybe adopt her.

526
00:44:19,558 --> 00:44:20,318
D.

527
00:44:20,393 --> 00:44:21,633
I'm serious.

528
00:44:22,762 --> 00:44:25,003
Her mother's dying of AIDS in a hospice.

529
00:44:25,004 --> 00:44:29,300
And Leike's dad back in Nigeria denies paternity
and won't accept custody of her.

530
00:44:29,301 --> 00:44:33,260
- We're working on it. One of our own.
- And we can keep working on it.

531
00:44:34,874 --> 00:44:36,469
I've thought about this a lot.

532
00:44:36,743 --> 00:44:39,088
And it feels right.

533
00:44:40,012 --> 00:44:44,744
- It feels like it's meant to be.
- You can't just lay this on me and expect me to...

534
00:44:47,787 --> 00:44:48,898
God.

535
00:44:59,866 --> 00:45:01,233
Will you think about it?

536
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,822
It's important to me.

537
00:45:05,204 --> 00:45:06,315
Please.

538
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,188
Yeah, I'll think about it.

539
00:45:10,076 --> 00:45:11,276
Thank you.

540
00:45:32,332 --> 00:45:33,966
- I can't do this.
- Oh.

541
00:45:34,066 --> 00:45:37,181
I haven't even spoken Hebrew since my bar mitzvah, you know?

542
00:45:37,182 --> 00:45:38,633
I... I didn't even know it then.

543
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:41,106
You know what? You guys, you're all the same.

544
00:45:41,608 --> 00:45:43,742
All of you. You're all reform at best.

545
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:46,051
Most of you haven't gone to Shul since your bar mitzvahs.

546
00:45:46,052 --> 00:45:48,773
But first thing you do when you come
over here is play the Jew card.

547
00:45:48,774 --> 00:45:50,300
Haven't you got any shame?

548
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:52,300
Ouch. That's pretty...

549
00:45:53,533 --> 00:45:54,644
Hello?

550
00:45:54,866 --> 00:45:56,966
Hey, Mum. Hey, hey, hey.
How are you doing?

551
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:58,960
Yeah, did you get my message?

552
00:45:59,225 --> 00:46:01,088
Uh-huh. Yeah.

553
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,950
Well, what about the rabbi?

554
00:46:03,644 --> 00:46:09,744
No, I need you to get him to write a letter
like on the Temple's letterhead

555
00:46:10,102 --> 00:46:14,077
saying, uh, that I attend services regularly.

556
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,633
Uh, I was bar mitzvahed by him.
And that I'm, you know,

557
00:46:18,744 --> 00:46:22,105
I'm strongly committed to the Jewish faith.

558
00:46:22,415 --> 00:46:23,526
All right.

559
00:46:23,529 --> 00:46:26,400
Well, listen, I'm kind of busy right now.
But I'll get back to you, though.

560
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:28,966
And will you do that for me?
Yeah, you promise? Okay.

561
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:31,723
Listen, M... Yeah.
I'll speak to you soon.

562
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:35,242
All right. I love you, too.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye-bye.

563
00:46:37,222 --> 00:46:39,588
Ahh...

564
00:46:39,634 --> 00:46:42,633
Iook, l... I got to be home by 10, yeah?

565
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:44,633
So, um...

566
00:46:45,204 --> 00:46:46,411
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

567
00:46:46,644 --> 00:46:48,255
- With everything.
- Thank you.

568
00:46:48,256 --> 00:46:52,220
Oh, what about if I just kind of twiddled these...
these side bits here?

569
00:46:52,221 --> 00:46:56,500
You think I'd get away with that?
If I just stick these out like that?

570
00:46:58,551 --> 00:47:02,170
I can go all night with my wife,
but I'm like a teenager with you.

571
00:47:10,029 --> 00:47:12,297
Doesn't sound like you've gone all night
with her in a long while.

572
00:47:12,864 --> 00:47:14,777
It used to be hot between us.

573
00:47:15,968 --> 00:47:20,140
One day, you're just not into it anymore.

574
00:47:21,473 --> 00:47:23,188
It becomes like an effort.

575
00:47:24,143 --> 00:47:28,288
Easier to jerk yourself off in the shower
than to rub her back for half an hour.

576
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,362
Bloody sad.

577
00:47:30,364 --> 00:47:31,475
Yeah, it is.

578
00:47:34,387 --> 00:47:37,488
Maybe I'll come watch you on the set next week.

579
00:47:40,226 --> 00:47:42,077
That's not part of the deal.

580
00:47:42,462 --> 00:47:45,799
It's not supposed to be.
I just thought I'd stop by and...

581
00:47:46,265 --> 00:47:49,522
Um, I got to go.

582
00:47:49,855 --> 00:47:52,728
I've got a meeting with an agent.

583
00:47:54,211 --> 00:47:56,633
If she signs me, it's major.

584
00:47:58,588 --> 00:47:59,903
I'll call you tomorrow.

585
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:22,771
Denise Frankel.

586
00:49:23,262 --> 00:49:24,913
- Hello.
- Hello.

587
00:49:25,035 --> 00:49:26,903
Please, thank you for helping my daughter.

588
00:49:27,332 --> 00:49:30,010
Clearly, this is not about her immigration status.

589
00:49:30,011 --> 00:49:34,500
But they're using her lack of status to get around
normal criminal and juvenile proceedings.

590
00:49:36,575 --> 00:49:40,299
- My wife wants to know when we can see her.
- I'm working on that.

591
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,199
I'm pushing for a one-on-one with the FBI
task force officer tomorrow.

592
00:49:49,176 --> 00:49:52,077
Right now, your entire family is at risk for removal.

593
00:49:52,925 --> 00:49:55,394
I recommend you do not go back to your apartment.

594
00:49:55,761 --> 00:49:58,315
Do you have any friends or family with whom you can stay?

595
00:50:11,755 --> 00:50:12,766
Rosa.

596
00:50:14,088 --> 00:50:15,379
Come on, Rosa.

597
00:50:15,648 --> 00:50:17,445
Rosa. Rosa.

598
00:50:17,516 --> 00:50:19,299
Can't find you, Rosa.

599
00:50:23,689 --> 00:50:26,450
And another one bites the dust.

600
00:50:27,126 --> 00:50:28,420
We do our best.

601
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,744
I'm sure you do, sir.

602
00:50:31,564 --> 00:50:32,675
Yes.

603
00:50:33,399 --> 00:50:34,459
Yes, this is him.

604
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:38,697
Who?

605
00:51:01,533 --> 00:51:03,592
Hey, Hamid.

606
00:51:03,663 --> 00:51:05,970
Hamid? Hey, Hamid.

607
00:51:06,165 --> 00:51:07,276
Hey!

608
00:51:08,167 --> 00:51:09,456
What's up?

609
00:51:09,535 --> 00:51:11,369
I, uh... It's my sister.

610
00:51:11,737 --> 00:51:12,848
What's the matter?

611
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:22,855
Maybe you can help me.

612
00:51:34,827 --> 00:51:36,199
Do you recognize him?

613
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:40,625
Agent Baraheri?

614
00:51:46,071 --> 00:51:47,533
It's her boss,

615
00:51:47,907 --> 00:51:49,345
from the print shop where she works.

616
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:53,099
We've got security video from the motel

617
00:51:53,613 --> 00:51:56,980
of an unidentified male perp in a hooded
sweatshirt leaving the scene.

618
00:51:57,116 --> 00:51:59,411
Time of death somewhere between 11 and midnight.

619
00:52:03,489 --> 00:52:06,999
Did you know that your sister was having
relations with Mr. Bedraz,

620
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:10,414
who was married with two young kids?

621
00:52:13,899 --> 00:52:18,400
I never talked to her about the details of her private life, no.

622
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:22,299
Do you know of anyone who may have had it in for her?

623
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,399
Jealous of her, perhaps?

624
00:52:25,111 --> 00:52:27,152
Like I said, I didn't get into her life.

625
00:52:29,448 --> 00:52:30,633
There's something else.

626
00:52:33,686 --> 00:52:37,511
I found these while going through Mr. Bedraz' jacket
looking for identification.

627
00:52:37,823 --> 00:52:39,299
They come in sets of threes.

628
00:52:39,658 --> 00:52:41,551
Green card, driver's license, social.

629
00:52:41,827 --> 00:52:43,299
All counterfeit.

630
00:52:43,955 --> 00:52:46,744
We found more of this stuff at his apartment
earlier this afternoon.

631
00:52:47,699 --> 00:52:51,440
As best we can figure, he was cranking them out
after hours at the store.

632
00:52:51,703 --> 00:52:55,500
We've referred that end of it to your documented
benefit for our task force.

633
00:52:55,874 --> 00:53:00,150
Think it might be Mexican mafia, upset about
him cutting into their action?

634
00:53:01,346 --> 00:53:03,560
We're looking at a number of possibilities right now.

635
00:53:06,217 --> 00:53:10,115
When would be a good time to interview your other
family members, Agent Baraheri?

636
00:53:11,957 --> 00:53:13,368
Can I just...

637
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:18,602
I'd like to spend a moment with my sister alone, please.

638
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:19,941
Of course.

639
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,311
Um...

640
00:53:23,402 --> 00:53:25,300
I'm sorry for your loss.

641
00:53:40,486 --> 00:53:43,111
I hate the fucking smell of that place.

642
00:53:48,026 --> 00:53:49,357
I know you're judging me, Max.

643
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:53,819
- What are you talking about?
- My sister.

644
00:53:54,222 --> 00:53:55,966
What you witnessed last night.

645
00:53:57,369 --> 00:54:00,598
Now I'm mourning her.
You doubt the veracity of my heart.

646
00:54:01,106 --> 00:54:03,966
I'm just sitting here feeling your pain, my friend.

647
00:54:04,088 --> 00:54:06,300
Feeling for your entire family.

648
00:54:06,512 --> 00:54:10,744
It's a sad, terrible thing, your loss.
No way do I doubt your love for your sister.

649
00:54:13,319 --> 00:54:14,419
No way.

650
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:23,580
Well, if you need someone to talk it through with...

651
00:54:24,163 --> 00:54:25,263
Thank you.

652
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:49,188
Officially, she's being held for an unlawful
presence in the United States.

653
00:54:49,683 --> 00:54:52,684
Unofficially... and I'll never repeat this outside this room...

654
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:56,930
she's being detained for presenting an imminent
threat to the security of the United States,

655
00:54:56,888 --> 00:54:59,633
based upon evidence that she planned to be a suicide bomber.

656
00:55:01,555 --> 00:55:04,966
- And what evidence would that be?
- Don't play coy with me, counselor.

657
00:55:05,766 --> 00:55:07,188
The signs are all there.

658
00:55:07,655 --> 00:55:11,816
We're talking about a devout Muslim young woman
who at 15 years of age walks around veiled.

659
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:14,907
Who engages in internet talk focused on the duty of Jihad.

660
00:55:14,989 --> 00:55:16,855
And writes openly about suicide.

661
00:55:17,682 --> 00:55:19,335
Did you take a look at her bedroom?

662
00:55:19,345 --> 00:55:20,500
How austere it was?

663
00:55:21,487 --> 00:55:25,080
This isn't the life of a normal teenager.
Everything about her is a red flag.

664
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:29,400
Only when viewed through the distorted
looking glass of your own paranoias.

665
00:55:29,528 --> 00:55:32,855
I could joust with you all day, but here's
the reality of our situation.

666
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,040
She's illegal. She's removable.

667
00:55:36,235 --> 00:55:40,618
And I intend to have Immigration and Customs Enforcement
remove her to ensure the safety of the American people.

668
00:55:40,619 --> 00:55:41,966
Just like that?

669
00:55:42,708 --> 00:55:48,077
You would uproot a 15-year-old American teenager who
came to this country when she was 3 years old?

670
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:51,097
Who doesn't speak Bangla, at least not with any fluency.

671
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:56,900
And based on the most circumstantial of evidence,
you would exile her to a Third World garbage dump

672
00:55:56,901 --> 00:55:59,300
that to her might as well be another planet?

673
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:02,966
That's exactly what I'm going to do, counselor.

674
00:56:04,196 --> 00:56:05,663
What about the rest of the family?

675
00:56:05,664 --> 00:56:07,698
The two younger siblings are American citizens.

676
00:56:07,699 --> 00:56:10,721
Yes, they're American citizens, and they're shit out of luck.

677
00:56:14,806 --> 00:56:16,906
Unless...

678
00:56:44,402 --> 00:56:46,188
Have you got company?

679
00:56:48,039 --> 00:56:49,039
No.

680
00:56:50,411 --> 00:56:51,744
Are you looking for some?

681
00:57:02,354 --> 00:57:04,115
I'm not being funny, all right, Claire.

682
00:57:04,116 --> 00:57:09,018
But I... I just want to know why some INS
guy would commit fraud for you.

683
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:12,411
- It's not like you're famous enough to get that kind of visa.
- All right.

684
00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:15,299
No, I'm only saying.
I only know 'cause I tried.

685
00:57:17,369 --> 00:57:19,737
Well, they don't call it the INS anymore.

686
00:57:23,575 --> 00:57:24,744
Gavin?

687
00:57:25,577 --> 00:57:26,688
Come on.

688
00:57:27,513 --> 00:57:29,770
I always thought I'd have to marry an American guy.

689
00:57:30,582 --> 00:57:33,077
That's why I didn't see any point in us, you know?

690
00:57:33,418 --> 00:57:35,077
But I don't have to do that now.

691
00:57:35,555 --> 00:57:38,842
I don't have to marry an American guy.
I can be with the guy that I'm into.

692
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:43,633
This changes everything for us.

693
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:45,541
You know?

694
00:57:52,437 --> 00:57:53,448
I just, uh...

695
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,300
I just want to know why he's taking all that risk for you.

696
00:57:59,301 --> 00:58:01,299
- You know?
- Oh.

697
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:02,668
Are you paying him?

698
00:58:07,052 --> 00:58:09,411
- Where'd you even get the case worker?
- Oh, baby.

699
00:58:10,055 --> 00:58:11,446
- Are you paying him?
-No.

700
00:58:12,224 --> 00:58:14,299
It... Don't go there, baby.

701
00:58:15,198 --> 00:58:18,420
Oh, come on, Claire.
How are you paying him?

702
00:58:18,421 --> 00:58:20,855
Well... Come back.

703
00:58:20,856 --> 00:58:22,465
No. How are you paying him, Claire?

704
00:58:25,766 --> 00:58:26,966
How are you paying him?

705
00:58:33,955 --> 00:58:36,440
No. No.

706
00:58:36,448 --> 00:58:38,027
You are fucking kidding me.

707
00:58:38,517 --> 00:58:40,522
You are fucking kidding me.

708
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:46,117
I am such a fucking idiot.
You are fuck... Are you serious?

709
00:58:49,050 --> 00:58:52,422
Baby, I want to be with you, baby.
You know I want to be with you.

710
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:53,411
Were you with him today?

711
00:58:54,299 --> 00:58:55,462
- Please don't do this.
- Were you with him today?

712
00:58:55,463 --> 00:58:57,659
- Baby, please don't do this.
- Just tell me. Were you with him today?

713
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:00,099
Was he inside of you today?
Were you with him today?

714
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:03,966
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck. How many times?

715
00:59:04,909 --> 00:59:07,300
How many times, Claire?
I just want to know.

716
00:59:07,301 --> 00:59:11,077
I just want to know how fucked you have to get
to get a fucking green card!

717
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:12,611
Fuck!

718
00:59:23,423 --> 00:59:24,534
Um...

719
00:59:32,005 --> 00:59:33,833
as often as he wants.

720
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:42,540
It's only for two months, and then I never have to see him again.

721
00:59:42,541 --> 00:59:48,127
And I never have to worry about being
deported or being narced on.

722
00:59:48,128 --> 00:59:49,239
I can just...

723
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:21,901
Hey!

724
01:01:23,866 --> 01:01:24,744
Easy. Easy.

725
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:25,871
Immigration!

726
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,511
Mireya?

727
01:01:29,492 --> 01:01:31,166
- Hey, hold her!
- Mireya?

728
01:01:37,055 --> 01:01:38,833
<i>Lo siento. Lo siento.</i>

729
01:01:40,393 --> 01:01:41,504
Thanks.

730
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:52,722
I'm sorry. You have very few options,
none of them favorable to your situation.

731
01:01:54,474 --> 01:01:57,980
You may request voluntary departure as an entire family

732
01:01:58,511 --> 01:02:00,722
and leave the United States immediately.

733
01:02:00,744 --> 01:02:05,700
Or you may choose to fight the matter,
which inevitably would lead to deportation.

734
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:09,499
There is a third option.

735
01:02:11,362 --> 01:02:13,221
And as painful as it is,

736
01:02:13,522 --> 01:02:16,211
I am required to present it to you.

737
01:02:17,615 --> 01:02:22,388
One of you could choose voluntary departure
and leave with Taslima,

738
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:26,833
and one of you could remain in the U.S. with Jahanara and Abul.

739
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,450
How is that possible?

740
01:02:29,453 --> 01:02:34,268
Special Agent Phadkar has intimated to me that
if we were to choose that course of action,

741
01:02:34,269 --> 01:02:39,833
Immigration would not seek out the remaining parent,
provided they kept a low profile.

742
01:02:40,522 --> 01:02:42,580
There is something else you should understand.

743
01:02:43,622 --> 01:02:46,944
Whichever of you remains, if you choose that,

744
01:02:47,644 --> 01:02:52,180
if you try to see Taslima before she leaves,
you would be taking a really big risk.

745
01:02:52,533 --> 01:02:57,550
In all likelihood, she will be escorted by Immigration
agents all the way to her departure gate.

746
01:03:11,122 --> 01:03:12,955
All right, girls.
Come on! Lights out.

747
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:16,890
- Under the covers.
- Lights out in two minutes.

748
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,414
<i>Vamanos, María.</i>

749
01:03:24,199 --> 01:03:26,499
<i>You look like you need a friend.</i>

750
01:03:29,088 --> 01:03:31,830
Are you waiting for your mommy to come get you, too?

751
01:03:34,708 --> 01:03:35,819
Yeah.

752
01:03:37,099 --> 01:03:38,277
Yeah, I am.

753
01:03:38,444 --> 01:03:39,730
When is she coming?

754
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:43,388
Any day now.

755
01:03:44,918 --> 01:03:46,833
Do you know any good stories?

756
01:03:47,753 --> 01:03:50,100
I know a lot of good stories.

757
01:03:51,088 --> 01:03:52,441
All right, girls. Lights out!

758
01:03:52,533 --> 01:03:56,277
- Come here, and I'll tell you all the best ones.
- Time for bed!

759
01:04:03,333 --> 01:04:08,277
And how could you disbelieve while to you were
being recited the verses of Allah.

760
01:05:06,099 --> 01:05:07,166
Hey, Chin.

761
01:05:07,188 --> 01:05:09,055
- Good morning.
- Black suit.

762
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:12,660
This is clean and press.
You gotta get the smell out of it.

763
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:20,397
- Hospital, hmm?
- Yeah.

764
01:05:24,117 --> 01:05:25,328
Thank you.

765
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:30,722
Uh, better not forget this.

766
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:36,191
Very nice.

767
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,850
Hey, can we do this now or what, huh?

768
01:05:57,422 --> 01:05:58,500
I'm leaving her.

769
01:05:59,718 --> 01:06:00,813
Okay.

770
01:06:01,787 --> 01:06:03,550
We won't have to skulk around anymore.

771
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:07,055
Skulking's fine with me.
I'm not exactly proud of this arrangement.

772
01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:08,400
I don't want an arrangement.

773
01:06:08,501 --> 01:06:10,170
- Cole...
- Just listen to me.

774
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:15,833
I know this started in a fucked-up place.
And that you are not here on your own volition.

775
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:17,832
And that there's a...

776
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:24,944
there's a good chance I probably make your skin crawl.

777
01:06:25,522 --> 01:06:28,288
I just want us to start over again.

778
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:32,166
I wouldn't say who I was.
I wouldn't put any kind of scare in you.

779
01:06:32,977 --> 01:06:36,511
- Just ask you out for a cup of coffee.
- I'm not looking to renegotiate.

780
01:06:36,512 --> 01:06:38,499
- You're not hearing me.
- No.

781
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:44,669
You're not hearing me.
This is what you need to understand, okay?

782
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:47,890
When I come into one of these fleabag rooms,

783
01:06:48,467 --> 01:06:49,944
I switch off.

784
01:06:51,499 --> 01:06:54,277
You might as well be making it with a rubber fuck doll,

785
01:06:54,702 --> 01:06:58,500
because she'd be giving you more emotion
than you'd ever get from me.

786
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,611
When I get home,

787
01:07:02,855 --> 01:07:06,055
I'm an hour in the shower, getting clean of you.

788
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:12,166
That is the extent of it. That is as real as it
is ever going to get between us.

789
01:07:13,844 --> 01:07:15,144
Is that clear enough...

790
01:07:15,995 --> 01:07:17,206
for you?

791
01:07:20,365 --> 01:07:21,476
Hmm?

792
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:30,166
So you want to do this now or what?

793
01:07:49,577 --> 01:07:50,800
You won't hear from me again.

794
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,755
And your green card will be in the mail.

795
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:01,611
Good luck, Claire.

796
01:09:25,905 --> 01:09:26,916
Hamid.

797
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:29,500
How are you doing?

798
01:09:34,299 --> 01:09:35,055
Hey, listen,

799
01:09:37,390 --> 01:09:41,277
you left your jacket in the car on the way back from the morgue.

800
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:44,252
You were complaining about the smell,
so I took it to the dry cleaners.

801
01:09:44,253 --> 01:09:45,782
You can pick it up any time.

802
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:52,055
That wasn't necessary, but thanks.

803
01:09:54,927 --> 01:09:58,277
This fell out of the pocket at the cleaners.

804
01:10:01,527 --> 01:10:05,410
I was wondering why it wasn't in her personal effects envelope.

805
01:10:06,932 --> 01:10:09,611
She broke it a few days ago.

806
01:10:10,088 --> 01:10:11,530
I said I'd get it fixed.

807
01:10:12,371 --> 01:10:13,482
Repaired.

808
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:19,500
I got a friend with a shop on Western, and...

809
01:10:23,126 --> 01:10:25,344
Thanks for coming, Max.

810
01:10:52,244 --> 01:10:53,355
Gavin Kossef?

811
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:56,951
Gavin Kossef!

812
01:10:57,051 --> 01:10:58,162
Uh, yeah.

813
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,277
I have to be honest with you, Mr. Kossef.

814
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:06,250
I don't see much experience here as a religious worker.
You're not an ordained rabbi, are you?

815
01:11:06,325 --> 01:11:07,611
Uh, no, no, I'm not.

816
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:12,825
But you know, I've spent many years devoted to my faith.
Uh, I grew up in a religious family,

817
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:14,790
I attended services regularly.

818
01:11:15,275 --> 01:11:17,193
I was bar mitzvahed.

819
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:21,500
- I've taken Jewish leadership courses...
- I'm still not sure that qualifies you.

820
01:11:21,501 --> 01:11:23,499
You know, I honor my religion daily. And...

821
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:29,010
You know, in the Jewish school where I teach,
I lead the class in prayers.

822
01:11:29,011 --> 01:11:30,494
We discuss Bible stories.

823
01:11:30,495 --> 01:11:33,055
And you've been working at this school illegally, right?

824
01:11:33,733 --> 01:11:35,611
Yes, l... I have.

825
01:11:36,199 --> 01:11:39,282
- Yeah. But I've admitted to that.
- You can read the language?

826
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:40,418
Hebrew, right?

827
01:11:41,924 --> 01:11:42,500
Yes.

828
01:11:42,601 --> 01:11:44,687
And what about the prayers? You can, uh...

829
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:48,160
You can recite the important prayers of your faith?
You can do that, right?

830
01:11:48,161 --> 01:11:49,560
Uh, yes. Yes.

831
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:55,607
I can do the prayer for wine, um, the prayer for bread...

832
01:11:55,807 --> 01:11:57,390
Excuse me just a moment.

833
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:07,711
Shit.

834
01:12:11,633 --> 01:12:12,544
Fuck.

835
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,740
Please come in.
Close the door right behind you.

836
01:12:22,411 --> 01:12:24,722
Mr. Kossef, this is Rabbi Yoffie.

837
01:12:26,572 --> 01:12:27,683
Uh, Rabbi.

838
01:12:33,412 --> 01:12:35,260
Ordinarily, I'd file a request for evidence.

839
01:12:35,261 --> 01:12:38,611
But something tells me this approach will prove more expedient.

840
01:12:40,552 --> 01:12:46,177
I'd like Mr. Kossef to recite a prayer to substantiate his
knowledge of the Jewish teachings above that of a layman's.

841
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:50,556
If you could suggest something and authenticate
his response, I'd greatly appreciate it, Rabbi.

842
01:12:52,988 --> 01:12:56,524
You may recite the Mourner's Kaddish, no?

843
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,500
The Mourner's Kaddish?

844
01:13:01,146 --> 01:13:02,257
<i>Nu?</i>

845
01:13:05,277 --> 01:13:07,500
Uh, yes. Yeah.

846
01:13:10,211 --> 01:13:11,322
Uh...

847
01:13:12,922 --> 01:13:17,105
Oh, sir It's a tradition that you cover your head.

848
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:21,856
If you just put your hands on your head like that.

849
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,011
Right?

850
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:27,214
Um... like that.

851
01:13:28,422 --> 01:13:29,215
Yeah.

852
01:14:05,912 --> 01:14:08,660
Amen.

853
01:14:22,088 --> 01:14:23,489
Very nice.

854
01:14:24,967 --> 01:14:26,460
Very moving.

855
01:14:30,650 --> 01:14:33,399
You should sing in my services sometimes.

856
01:14:33,511 --> 01:14:36,040
Oh, l... I would love to.

857
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:39,607
Thank you very much, Rabbi.
We'll be with you shortly.

858
01:14:40,505 --> 01:14:41,616
Thank you.

859
01:14:44,644 --> 01:14:46,800
Well, can't argue with that.

860
01:14:50,007 --> 01:14:51,218
Rabbi?

861
01:14:53,833 --> 01:14:56,211
I wasn't kidding about the voice.

862
01:14:56,650 --> 01:15:00,247
I expect you tomorrow morning, Temple Beth Shalom.

863
01:15:00,863 --> 01:15:03,833
About the rest, we can teach you.

864
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:36,459
I don't want to leave Jah and Abul.

865
01:15:38,930 --> 01:15:40,833
When will I ever see them again?

866
01:15:44,853 --> 01:15:45,964
Or Papa?

867
01:15:49,522 --> 01:15:55,550
He wants to be able to say goodbye to you,
but what if he was to come here today?

868
01:15:55,755 --> 01:15:58,480
They would arrest him and deport him as well.

869
01:15:58,650 --> 01:16:01,722
And then Jah and Abul will have to leave as well.

870
01:16:02,084 --> 01:16:03,195
I don't care!

871
01:16:03,793 --> 01:16:05,488
Why can't we all go?

872
01:16:07,271 --> 01:16:08,711
Why do they get to stay?

873
01:16:09,494 --> 01:16:11,260
Because they were born here.

874
01:16:12,974 --> 01:16:16,787
And if they stay and finish school, they have more opportunities.

875
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:19,502
And I don't

876
01:16:20,669 --> 01:16:23,722
because my life is shit now.

877
01:16:24,244 --> 01:16:26,533
I'm sorry. We're out of time.

878
01:16:40,547 --> 01:16:41,758
Mommy!

879
01:16:42,614 --> 01:16:43,836
Mommy, please!

880
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:45,210
Please!

881
01:16:45,391 --> 01:16:47,327
Please don't leave me, Mommy!

882
01:17:27,906 --> 01:17:29,017
Come, my sweets.

883
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,744
Say goodbye to your sister.

884
01:17:34,546 --> 01:17:37,066
You won't be seeing her for a long time.

885
01:17:37,116 --> 01:17:40,388
Please, I need the room for the next visit.

886
01:18:31,322 --> 01:18:33,135
Did Homicide see these tapes?

887
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:38,040
No. They figured it was gang-related,
so they only looked at the night of the murder.

888
01:18:38,041 --> 01:18:40,270
Slow down. Slow down.
That's them.

889
01:18:43,983 --> 01:18:45,194
Stop.

890
01:18:47,166 --> 01:18:48,277
That's the girl.

891
01:18:51,002 --> 01:18:52,211
Back up a little bit.

892
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:57,637
This car that just pulled in here.
Move in on there.

893
01:19:04,194 --> 01:19:05,405
Can't make anybody.

894
01:19:08,042 --> 01:19:09,430
Let's put another tape in.

895
01:19:13,477 --> 01:19:15,755
Roll on down.

896
01:19:18,857 --> 01:19:20,722
Slow it up. That's them.

897
01:19:21,055 --> 01:19:22,188
Stop.

898
01:19:23,943 --> 01:19:25,316
Well, I'll be damned.

899
01:19:26,264 --> 01:19:27,466
There he is again.

900
01:19:28,734 --> 01:19:31,269
- Can you go in on the license plate?
- Sure.

901
01:19:37,627 --> 01:19:41,277
2SAM564

902
01:19:43,858 --> 01:19:45,055
Let's go to the next day.

903
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:48,922
There they are, coming out.

904
01:19:53,372 --> 01:19:54,644
Back up a little bit.

905
01:19:56,495 --> 01:19:57,486
Go in on it.

906
01:20:01,190 --> 01:20:02,211
Same car.

907
01:20:03,022 --> 01:20:05,481
It's the same goddamn car.

908
01:20:06,833 --> 01:20:07,864
Let me run that.

909
01:20:20,450 --> 01:20:21,561
Another, please.

910
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:35,811
Another, please.

911
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:37,172
Last call, pal.

912
01:21:47,420 --> 01:21:51,427
- Hey, Yong. You ready to pop your cherry, bitch?
- Fuckin' balls, man! Come on!

913
01:21:52,460 --> 01:21:53,961
Come on, you fuckin' pussy!

914
01:22:00,647 --> 01:22:01,900
Get your fuckin' hands up!

915
01:22:06,643 --> 01:22:08,290
Move, motherfucker! You, too, bitch!

916
01:22:08,331 --> 01:22:09,437
Move it! Come on!

917
01:22:10,098 --> 01:22:11,915
Stand the fuck down, you fucking cunt!

918
01:22:11,869 --> 01:22:12,978
Open the fucking door!

919
01:22:13,533 --> 01:22:15,033
Don't you fucking dick me, old man!

920
01:22:15,034 --> 01:22:16,865
Open the fucking door now!

921
01:22:17,829 --> 01:22:18,935
Open the fucking door!

922
01:22:19,057 --> 01:22:20,450
You making big mistake.

923
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:25,250
You have no idea who money belongs to.
If I give to you, I die anyway.

924
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:28,133
Get the fuck back up, motherfucker!

925
01:22:29,332 --> 01:22:30,886
Get the fuck back up!

926
01:22:36,422 --> 01:22:37,433
Shut up!

927
01:22:37,348 --> 01:22:38,500
What the fuck?

928
01:22:38,502 --> 01:22:39,832
What'd you go and do that for?

929
01:22:39,833 --> 01:22:42,092
We weren't supposed to hurt anyone, Seung!

930
01:22:44,684 --> 01:22:46,611
That's it! Search him! Find the key!

931
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,277
Move, bitch! Shut the fuck up!

932
01:22:53,163 --> 01:22:55,493
Shut the fuck up! Get the fuck up!

933
01:22:56,285 --> 01:22:57,541
- Get the fuck up!
- Move!

934
01:22:59,138 --> 01:23:01,622
Yeah, blow her fucking head off if she tries anything!
Let's go!

935
01:23:01,623 --> 01:23:03,733
Hurry up! Hurry up!

936
01:23:03,734 --> 01:23:05,962
- Where's the key?
- Right, which fucking key?

937
01:23:05,963 --> 01:23:08,211
- Which key? Which key?
- I don't know!

938
01:23:08,212 --> 01:23:10,280
Which fucking key, bitch?
Which key?

939
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:13,388
Which fucking key?

940
01:23:18,666 --> 01:23:19,611
Fuck it. We're all in...

941
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,337
Put it down, man. I'll do it. I swear!

942
01:23:45,081 --> 01:23:46,611
You'll do her?

943
01:23:46,864 --> 01:23:49,118
Where the fuck did you learn to talk like that, huh?

944
01:23:49,584 --> 01:23:52,036
You get that on some American cop show
while you're growing up in Seoul?

945
01:23:52,257 --> 01:23:54,166
I'm not from fucking Seoul.
I'm from...

946
01:23:55,126 --> 01:23:59,055
Hey. How old were you when you came over?
You still got an accent.

947
01:23:59,364 --> 01:24:02,055
- I'm gonna say maybe 11, 12 years old.
- I don't give a shit!

948
01:24:02,347 --> 01:24:05,166
I'm gonna blow this bag's head off if
you don't put down your gun!

949
01:24:05,570 --> 01:24:08,300
Uh-huh. You still on the green card?

950
01:24:08,473 --> 01:24:10,364
I'm American citizen, raghead!

951
01:24:10,446 --> 01:24:14,248
My whole family just got naturalized!
We're doing all ceremony shit tomorrow!

952
01:24:14,446 --> 01:24:15,088
Oh, tomorrow?

953
01:24:16,157 --> 01:24:20,388
Hey. You haven't taken your oath yet.
That means you're not a citizen.

954
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:23,035
Not until you take the oath.

955
01:24:23,036 --> 01:24:26,499
And I don't see how the fuck that's
gonna happen now, you know?

956
01:24:27,633 --> 01:24:33,388
You're either gonna die here, or you're going away for murder.
You have done your parents proud.

957
01:24:33,630 --> 01:24:35,810
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

958
01:24:35,811 --> 01:24:39,499
They told me no one get hurt.
I didn't kill anyone!

959
01:24:39,522 --> 01:24:40,500
What am I supposed to do?

960
01:24:41,839 --> 01:24:42,822
I don't know what to fucking do!

961
01:24:42,823 --> 01:24:45,469
- How many in your family?
- Why do you keep asking about my family, Huh?

962
01:24:46,012 --> 01:24:47,617
They're not here now, are they?

963
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:49,661
How many in your family?

964
01:24:52,622 --> 01:24:53,733
My parents.

965
01:24:57,231 --> 01:24:59,058
My younger brother and sister.

966
01:25:03,311 --> 01:25:05,277
My sister was born here.

967
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:14,655
Well, tomorrow was supposed to be a special day.

968
01:25:15,211 --> 01:25:18,116
And you shit on it for your whole family.

969
01:25:18,618 --> 01:25:19,600
I've been through it.

970
01:25:21,479 --> 01:25:24,175
It was the most spiritual moment of my life.

971
01:25:25,648 --> 01:25:27,177
You know, you're standing there,

972
01:25:28,304 --> 01:25:31,166
looking around you at all these people from everywhere.

973
01:25:31,411 --> 01:25:35,220
Countries you can't even pronounce, you didn't even know existed.

974
01:25:37,058 --> 01:25:38,166
And they're happy.

975
01:25:39,931 --> 01:25:41,611
They're elated to be there

976
01:25:42,622 --> 01:25:44,611
because it's their choice.

977
01:25:48,458 --> 01:25:51,611
You wouldn't be here right now,

978
01:25:52,867 --> 01:25:54,306
in this mess you're in,

979
01:25:55,447 --> 01:25:59,775
if you could ever appreciate the awe you'd feel in that moment.

980
01:26:00,452 --> 01:26:02,055
The worthiness of the journey.

981
01:26:07,513 --> 01:26:08,624
So,

982
01:26:08,894 --> 01:26:13,514
when you're standing there tomorrow, in your new suit
and tie, I want you to look around.

983
01:26:14,083 --> 01:26:17,358
Okay? Look at those faces.

984
01:26:18,964 --> 01:26:22,560
And understand the sublime promise of this moment.

985
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:30,166
What the fuck, man.

986
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,700
I'm not gonna be there.
You said it yourself.

987
01:26:33,944 --> 01:26:35,855
Stop messing with my head.

988
01:26:36,121 --> 01:26:38,973
All right. The way to end this,

989
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,851
my friend, is for you to put down your gun.

990
01:26:41,892 --> 01:26:43,488
- Now I'm gonna put mine...
- What the fuck!

991
01:26:43,489 --> 01:26:44,860
What the fuck are you doing?

992
01:26:47,314 --> 01:26:49,499
- What the fuck...
- Now you put down your gun.

993
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:53,020
Let go of that woman.
You go in that back room.

994
01:26:53,544 --> 01:26:57,139
And you take the surveillance tapes out of the system. Okay?

995
01:26:58,328 --> 01:26:59,869
And you keep on walking.

996
01:27:00,562 --> 01:27:02,761
You're fucking with me.
Stop fucking with me!

997
01:27:03,250 --> 01:27:06,050
You think I'm some jackoff? Huh?

998
01:27:06,287 --> 01:27:11,316
I think you made a mistake, and you will never
make a mistake like this again.

999
01:27:33,672 --> 01:27:36,427
LAPD! Put your hands up!
Get 'em up!

1000
01:27:38,018 --> 01:27:39,129
Relax.

1001
01:27:39,574 --> 01:27:40,916
Situation's under control.

1002
01:27:41,702 --> 01:27:43,275
Help me out here.
You're saying there were four of them,

1003
01:27:43,276 --> 01:27:46,003
but the owner's wife is positive there were five.

1004
01:27:46,703 --> 01:27:48,482
She says you let one of them walk.

1005
01:27:49,054 --> 01:27:51,908
She also says you let him take the surveillance tapes with him.

1006
01:27:52,599 --> 01:27:54,880
She's confused. She had her head down most of the time.

1007
01:27:56,289 --> 01:27:58,430
Hey, I killed four of them.
Why would I let one go?

1008
01:27:58,950 --> 01:28:00,205
I look crazy to you?

1009
01:28:01,077 --> 01:28:02,815
I can tell you how many there were.

1010
01:28:04,850 --> 01:28:07,290
There were only four. She's mistaken.

1011
01:28:07,427 --> 01:28:10,406
This man, he saved our lives.

1012
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,299
There were four.
The witness has corroborated it.

1013
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:16,205
They must have been lax in surveillance.

1014
01:28:16,683 --> 01:28:18,650
Probably just covering up for insurance purposes.

1015
01:28:44,794 --> 01:28:46,761
Hamid. Where the fuck are you?

1016
01:28:47,050 --> 01:28:48,850
I need to talk to you as soon as possible.

1017
01:28:49,637 --> 01:28:52,029
Give me a call as soon as you get this message Immediately.

1018
01:28:52,530 --> 01:28:53,983
I don't care what time it is.

1019
01:29:00,348 --> 01:29:01,659
<i>One message.</i>

1020
01:29:02,717 --> 01:29:03,768
<i>Max, it's Kevin.</i>

1021
01:29:04,083 --> 01:29:05,645
<i>Listen, call me when you can.</i>

1022
01:29:06,097 --> 01:29:07,316
<i>Just a heads up.</i>

1023
01:29:07,449 --> 01:29:09,342
<i>LAPD contacted me a few minutes ago.</i>

1024
01:29:09,343 --> 01:29:12,427
<i>Apparently, Hamid was involved in a
shootout tonight in Koreatown.</i>

1025
01:29:13,561 --> 01:29:17,549
<i>Don't worry. He's fine, but I'm heading over
to the crime scene now to check things out.</i>

1026
01:29:17,650 --> 01:29:18,761
<i>Try me on my cell.</i>

1027
01:29:20,289 --> 01:29:21,289
<i>End of messages.</i>

1028
01:29:34,604 --> 01:29:38,115
"I'm not interested in you. I'm not interested.
I'm not interested in you.

1029
01:29:39,057 --> 01:29:40,983
For one, you're too old for me."

1030
01:29:42,997 --> 01:29:47,205
Miss Shepard, I'm Special Agent Ludwig with
ICE's Document and Benefit fraud unit.

1031
01:29:47,672 --> 01:29:49,992
This is my partner, Special Agent Howell.

1032
01:29:50,667 --> 01:29:52,872
May we have a word with you inside, please?

1033
01:29:56,410 --> 01:30:01,205
We discovered these and quite a few others when we
performed a search of Javier Pedraza's apartment.

1034
01:30:01,206 --> 01:30:03,710
I didn't, um, use these.
I didn't go back for them.

1035
01:30:03,712 --> 01:30:06,510
- So you can't, um...
- You see what's interesting, Miss Shepard,

1036
01:30:06,511 --> 01:30:08,411
is we ran a check on your name.

1037
01:30:08,950 --> 01:30:12,385
A Claire Shepard arrived on a B2 visitor's visa seven months ago.

1038
01:30:12,650 --> 01:30:18,205
And then just two days ago, she has her status adjusted to
an EB-1 green card for persons of extraordinary ability.

1039
01:30:18,883 --> 01:30:22,833
According to the Internet Movie Database, the only
Claire Shepard that matches your spelling,

1040
01:30:22,834 --> 01:30:26,872
age, and place of birth, has two credits on
little-known Aussie TV shows.

1041
01:30:27,316 --> 01:30:28,427
Walk-on roles.

1042
01:30:28,672 --> 01:30:30,983
She hasn't won any national or international awards.

1043
01:30:31,116 --> 01:30:35,206
Which is something the adjudicator who handled your
case would have to have been aware of.

1044
01:30:36,105 --> 01:30:38,650
And yet he approved you for an EB-1.

1045
01:30:39,347 --> 01:30:40,558
Miss Shepard.

1046
01:30:41,994 --> 01:30:47,205
We'd like you to tell us about your relationship with
Center Adjudications Officer Cole Frankel.

1047
01:30:53,678 --> 01:30:55,294
Congratulations, McGill.

1048
01:31:01,661 --> 01:31:02,661
Mr. Frankel.

1049
01:31:03,561 --> 01:31:06,538
Special Agents Poulson and Womack. OIG.

1050
01:31:07,450 --> 01:31:09,094
We have a warrant for your arrest.

1051
01:31:11,050 --> 01:31:12,294
What is this, a joke?

1052
01:31:12,530 --> 01:31:14,600
I take it you're familiar with Claire Shepard.

1053
01:31:15,354 --> 01:31:17,772
She just traded you for voluntary departure.

1054
01:31:18,772 --> 01:31:19,949
Turn around, please.

1055
01:31:20,650 --> 01:31:21,538
Hands behind your back.

1056
01:31:21,539 --> 01:31:23,650
Do you have to do this?
Do you have to cuff me?

1057
01:31:23,651 --> 01:31:24,994
Yeah, I'm afraid we do.

1058
01:31:36,215 --> 01:31:37,650
What the hell is this?

1059
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:41,205
Cole, where are you go... where...
what's going on?

1060
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:44,538
Ma'am, your husband is under arrest for immigration fraud.

1061
01:31:45,683 --> 01:31:46,694
Cole.

1062
01:31:55,490 --> 01:31:57,116
Good morning, everyone.

1063
01:31:57,650 --> 01:32:02,190
My name is Judge Leslie Freeman, of the Federal District Court.

1064
01:32:02,380 --> 01:32:05,976
And it is my great pleasure to welcome you here today.

1065
01:32:07,572 --> 01:32:11,110
All of you seated here share one thing in common.

1066
01:32:11,772 --> 01:32:17,972
You have all chosen, of your own free will,
to become citizens of this great nation.

1067
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:26,761
For many of you, the road to this joyous moment
has been fraught with hardship and sacrifice.

1068
01:32:28,290 --> 01:32:34,323
It is incumbent upon me to remind you of your
newfound responsibilities as citizens,

1069
01:32:34,910 --> 01:32:40,227
and also to remind you that an American citizenship
is not a guarantee of success

1070
01:32:40,301 --> 01:32:45,304
but rather the promise of opportunities.
Unlimited opportunities.

1071
01:32:45,661 --> 01:32:50,649
It has always been my contention that
America is a welcoming nation,

1072
01:32:50,750 --> 01:32:56,083
a country that accepts every new citizen
with an embrace of good faith.

1073
01:32:56,780 --> 01:33:04,872
You have endless credit to pursue your hopes and dreams,
as long as you honor the rules and laws of our society.

1074
01:33:05,270 --> 01:33:08,104
I myself am a first-generation American.

1075
01:33:08,105 --> 01:33:09,930
- I guess I called it right.
- Max?

1076
01:33:11,161 --> 01:33:13,893
Well, he's gotta put the family first.
Ain't that right, Hamid?

1077
01:33:15,236 --> 01:33:16,305
You know what I'm talking about.

1078
01:33:17,380 --> 01:33:20,548
- Do we have to do this right now?
- Yes, God damn it. Right now.

1079
01:33:22,190 --> 01:33:27,570
An innocent... yes, innocent young woman was brutally
murdered 'cause she flashed a little tit

1080
01:33:27,571 --> 01:33:33,538
on occasion, got it on with a married man,
tried to live her life outside your goddamn family.

1081
01:33:34,430 --> 01:33:35,773
She was your sister.

1082
01:33:38,497 --> 01:33:40,634
She deserved better than that from you.

1083
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:44,470
In this country, we don't abide by that shit.

1084
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:47,642
We got a name for it. Murder.

1085
01:33:48,237 --> 01:33:50,484
Cold-blooded murder.

1086
01:33:50,485 --> 01:33:53,346
And you and Farid are going down for it.

1087
01:33:53,953 --> 01:33:56,427
Will our new citizens please stand?

1088
01:33:56,572 --> 01:33:58,010
Raise your right hand

1089
01:33:58,976 --> 01:34:02,624
and join me in reciting the Oath of Allegiance.

1090
01:34:02,894 --> 01:34:04,694
I hereby declare on oath...

1091
01:34:04,738 --> 01:34:07,089
I've got the surveillance tapes from the motel.

1092
01:34:09,789 --> 01:34:13,111
From the day before.
From last week.

1093
01:34:13,528 --> 01:34:15,270
I.D.'d Farid's Beemer.

1094
01:34:16,015 --> 01:34:19,589
He was watching her, reporting back to you,
waiting for you to take action.

1095
01:34:19,980 --> 01:34:25,049
I begged him, Max, to leave it alone,
but he was being pressured by our father.

1096
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:26,538
We both were.

1097
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:31,083
He poisoned Farid's mind with this talk about the
shame that we brought on our family,

1098
01:34:31,084 --> 01:34:33,290
because of her. But he never...

1099
01:34:33,391 --> 01:34:37,228
he never intended for this to happen.

1100
01:34:40,406 --> 01:34:43,983
Only that we would teach her a lesson.

1101
01:34:44,883 --> 01:34:47,994
We were supposed to catch them in the
act and beat them like dogs.

1102
01:34:48,180 --> 01:34:50,305
My father wanted Zahra humiliated,

1103
01:34:51,627 --> 01:34:53,450
- brought in line.
- Congratulations to all you citizens.

1104
01:35:00,994 --> 01:35:02,438
I wanted no part of it.

1105
01:35:04,131 --> 01:35:07,986
I thought if I just turned my back,

1106
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:10,826
it would all go away.

1107
01:35:14,450 --> 01:35:20,142
And now will you please stand and place
your right hand over your heart

1108
01:35:20,570 --> 01:35:24,410
as we listen to Phil Perry sing our National Anthem.

1109
01:35:24,624 --> 01:35:26,220
¶ Oh say ¶

1110
01:35:26,450 --> 01:35:30,480
¶ Can you see ¶

¶ early light ¶

1113
01:35:38,025 --> 01:35:39,872
He arrived at my apartment that night.

1114
01:35:41,783 --> 01:35:42,872
After he...

1115
01:35:44,005 --> 01:35:45,016
After he...

1116
01:35:50,661 --> 01:35:52,348
Help me, Hamid.
Please, God, help me.

1117
01:35:54,193 --> 01:35:55,258
How did you get this?

1118
01:35:56,105 --> 01:35:57,143
Where's Zahra?

1119
01:35:57,672 --> 01:35:59,998
- I only wanted to scare her.
- What are you talking about?

1120
01:36:00,005 --> 01:36:01,470
I couldn't stand it anymore.

1121
01:36:01,761 --> 01:36:05,094
- Her seeing a degenerate fucking beaner.
- What did you do, Farid?

1122
01:36:05,136 --> 01:36:07,054
I only wanted to get in his face a little bit.

1123
01:36:07,116 --> 01:36:08,194
You have to take this.

1124
01:36:08,438 --> 01:36:10,480
You're a cop. You know how to do that kind of stuff.

1125
01:36:10,983 --> 01:36:13,590
- What did you do, Farid?
- I looked in the door.

1126
01:36:13,761 --> 01:36:15,094
They were doing it like animals.

1127
01:36:15,835 --> 01:36:16,946
Oh, shit!

1128
01:36:17,588 --> 01:36:19,750
What the fuck are you doing?
Get out of here!

1129
01:36:19,986 --> 01:36:22,477
- What the fuck is this shit?
- What's your fucking problem?

1130
01:36:24,283 --> 01:36:26,872
What did you do to our sister?
Tell me what you did!

1131
01:36:26,983 --> 01:36:28,094
She's my girl, man.

1132
01:36:28,127 --> 01:36:29,950
She's my girl. Don't be stupid.

1133
01:36:30,140 --> 01:36:31,529
Put the fucking gun down.

1134
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:34,549
Get the fuck outta here, man!

1135
01:36:40,450 --> 01:36:41,761
¶ In air ¶

1136
01:36:42,570 --> 01:36:46,680

1138
01:36:50,705 --> 01:36:52,580
You should have come to me, God damn it.

1139
01:36:52,661 --> 01:36:54,316
I was ashamed.

1140
01:36:55,455 --> 01:36:57,116
Ashamed of myself.

1141
01:36:57,249 --> 01:36:58,527
My family.

1142
01:37:01,263 --> 01:37:04,316
Better get yourself a good criminal attorney, Counselor.

1143
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:06,470
You're gonna need one.

1144
01:37:06,471 --> 01:37:08,872

01:37:26,550 --> 01:37:28,380
Running out on our National Anthem.

1148
01:37:29,325 --> 01:37:31,140
Now, that's just plain disrespectful.

1149
01:37:31,288 --> 01:37:34,650
¶ And the home ¶

1150

1152

Farid Baraheri, you are under arrest for the murder
of your sister, Zahra Baraheri,

1153
01:37:44,867 --> 01:37:46,542
and Javier Pedraza.

1154
01:37:58,290 --> 01:38:01,761
Congratulations to all our new citizens.

1155
01:38:02,872 --> 01:38:04,894
Good luck to all of you.

1156
01:38:15,661 --> 01:38:20,445
820 Bravo. 75 approaching position reported by Foxtrot.

1157
01:39:47,294 --> 01:39:49,561
820 on 10-42 Delta.

1158
01:39:49,563 --> 01:39:52,290
Approximately eighth of a mile east of Ambush Alley.

1159
01:39:52,295 --> 01:39:55,320
Confirming a female victim.
Mexican national.

1160
01:39:55,550 --> 01:39:59,615
Approximate age, mid-20s.
Looks like she's been out here a couple of days.

1161
01:40:00,883 --> 01:40:03,338
I think she paid the wrong coyote to bring her across.

1162
01:40:03,361 --> 01:40:08,010
<i>I copy. You are 10-42 Delta one eighth mile east of Ambush Alley.</i>

1163
01:40:08,164 --> 01:40:09,953
<i>I'll contact the PD and the coroner.</i>

1164
01:40:10,343 --> 01:40:12,933
10-4, 820. I'm standing by at this location.

1165
01:40:13,367 --> 01:40:17,054
<i>10-4, Bravo 75.
I'll also notify your FOS.</i>

1166
01:42:06,721 --> 01:42:08,427
Guess who's going home today.

1167
01:42:09,736 --> 01:42:12,431
- All of my friends leave.
- Not today, sweetie.

1168
01:42:12,672 --> 01:42:13,883
Someone's come for you.

1169
01:43:15,249 --> 01:43:18,092
Uh-oh. All right.

1170
01:43:36,790 --> 01:43:39,800
When we get in there, it's gonna be a real clusterfuck, so

1171
01:43:40,093 --> 01:43:41,350
watch your ass.

1172
01:43:41,478 --> 01:43:42,489
You got it.

1173
01:43:44,285 --> 01:43:45,187
Here we go.

1174
01:43:45,980 --> 01:43:47,091
Wait a second.

1175
01:43:50,286 --> 01:43:51,497
Brogan.

1176
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:53,865
Yeah, that was me.

1177
01:43:59,050 --> 01:44:00,316
You sure about that?

1178
01:44:01,016 --> 01:44:02,227
Mireya Sanchez.

1179
01:44:07,164 --> 01:44:08,650
What about the family? Have you...

1180
01:44:09,430 --> 01:44:11,761
Uh, do me a favor, will ya?
Hold off on that.

1181
01:44:13,209 --> 01:44:15,010
I'd like to take care of it myself.

1182
01:44:17,070 --> 01:44:20,761
I just want to do right by her.

1183
01:44:22,968 --> 01:44:25,761
Thanks. I'll be down as soon as I'm off shift.

1184
01:44:28,308 --> 01:44:30,190
God damn it, Max. We gotta roll, man.

1185
01:44:34,150 --> 01:44:36,005
Max! We gotta go!

1186
01:44:37,684 --> 01:44:40,650
Don't worry, Lieutenant.
You're not gonna miss anything.
