1
00:02:06,338 --> 00:02:08,325
THE CRIMSON RIVERS

2
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,687
We'll touch base in two hours.

3
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,515
-Which way do we go?
-There.

4
00:05:05,683 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay? See you later, guys.

5
00:05:16,327 --> 00:05:17,865
Can I help you?

6
00:05:18,365 --> 00:05:19,441
Got a light?

7
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:21,150
Who let you through?

8
00:05:21,525 --> 00:05:24,304
Your men. Commissioner Pierre Niemans.

9
00:05:26,515 --> 00:05:29,212
Just you? Paris said they'd send a unit.

10
00:05:29,384 --> 00:05:30,957
What the hell?

11
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:32,367
I'm the unit.

12
00:05:37,368 --> 00:05:38,031
Captain...

13
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:42,978
...l didn't drive all night
to wage war with cops.

14
00:05:45,103 --> 00:05:46,297
What's the low-down?

15
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,301
Follow me.

16
00:05:51,755 --> 00:05:55,445
Two days ago, the college dean
reported Remy Callois missing.

17
00:05:55,873 --> 00:05:57,611
Thirty-two years old, single.

18
00:05:57,785 --> 00:06:01,357
Remy lectured at the college.
He was also the librarian.

19
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,390
An upper-echelon job there.

20
00:06:03,898 --> 00:06:07,800
According to the Dean,
Remy was punctual and hardworking.

21
00:06:07,973 --> 00:06:09,924
He never showed up late.

22
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:11,501
Yesterday afternoon...

23
00:06:11,673 --> 00:06:14,204
...a young mountain climber
found his body.

24
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,035
Why call in the homicide squad?

25
00:06:20,156 --> 00:06:22,640
We're not used to this kind of stuff.

26
00:06:22,818 --> 00:06:24,012
Why?

27
00:06:24,522 --> 00:06:28,721
His body was strung up there.
At 50 meters.

28
00:06:40,157 --> 00:06:44,474
GUERNON - University, 500 meters

29
00:06:49,638 --> 00:06:53,210
You're from the homicide unit,
but not really, is that it?

30
00:06:53,422 --> 00:06:54,450
That's it.

31
00:06:57,165 --> 00:06:59,116
We never dealt with you before.

32
00:07:01,157 --> 00:07:02,398
You're lucky.

33
00:07:09,307 --> 00:07:12,712
HAPPY IS HE WHO PENETRATES
THE HIDDEN CAUSES OF THINGS

34
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:32,415
What's this college doing here?

35
00:07:32,883 --> 00:07:34,125
It's no ordinary college.

36
00:07:35,212 --> 00:07:37,991
It provides its own electricity,
its own water.

37
00:07:38,123 --> 00:07:39,778
It even has a hospital.

38
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,019
1,200 students.
100 professors and researchers.

39
00:07:44,152 --> 00:07:46,223
One of Europe's oldest universities.

40
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,875
In case of a snowstorm,
it can survive for a month.

41
00:07:54,132 --> 00:07:56,959
The Dean is like the mayor of the valley.

42
00:07:57,084 --> 00:07:59,071
He runs most of the region.

43
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,780
Here's where they form future Bill Gates.

44
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,269
Future what?

45
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:10,883
Future Bill Gates.

46
00:09:04,905 --> 00:09:07,187
The hospital's attached to the college?

47
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:09,925
It's open to everyone in the region.

48
00:09:10,103 --> 00:09:11,722
We all get free health care.

49
00:09:12,099 --> 00:09:13,885
We work a lot with them.

50
00:09:16,174 --> 00:09:18,077
There's even a maternity wing.

51
00:09:32,017 --> 00:09:35,837
This is Commissioner Niemans.
He'll be helping out on this case.

52
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:38,705
I was in your Criminology class in 1987.

53
00:09:38,836 --> 00:09:40,113
Did you start yet?

54
00:09:40,292 --> 00:09:41,994
I haven't cut the cord.

55
00:09:42,163 --> 00:09:43,274
Can we see?

56
00:09:43,452 --> 00:09:47,059
I figured you'd want to see him intact.
It's incredible.

57
00:09:47,236 --> 00:09:49,022
The work of a real madman.

58
00:09:50,396 --> 00:09:52,347
He strove for the foetal position.

59
00:09:53,141 --> 00:09:54,169
What position?

60
00:09:55,054 --> 00:09:58,660
The foetal.
Like a foetus in its mother's belly.

61
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:24,066
He's been dead for 48 hours.

62
00:10:25,242 --> 00:10:28,021
Examination reveals traces of incisions...

63
00:10:28,486 --> 00:10:32,139
...on the shoulders, arms,
elbows and thighs...

64
00:10:32,644 --> 00:10:35,387
...made by a sharp instrument.
A carpet cutter.

65
00:10:35,638 --> 00:10:37,541
Can you cut the cord?

66
00:10:41,293 --> 00:10:43,115
Four broken ribs.

67
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:46,647
Arms broken at the shoulders and elbows.

68
00:10:46,907 --> 00:10:52,725
Multiple fractures: tibia, hip....
I'll put it all in a detailed report.

69
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:57,468
The hands were amputated
before he died, with an axe...

70
00:10:57,635 --> 00:11:01,667
...the stumps cauterised
to avoid his bleeding to death.

71
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:06,148
The killer obviously wanted
to keep his victim alive.

72
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,161
I wouldn't do that....

73
00:11:42,378 --> 00:11:44,777
He carved out the eyes like a surgeon.

74
00:11:46,494 --> 00:11:48,646
Operating on a live patient.

75
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,433
What the fuck is this shit?

76
00:11:51,567 --> 00:11:55,599
The sockets were filled with rain.
It's being analysed.

77
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:59,788
There's a good eye doctor in Guernon.
He may shed some light on this.

78
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:04,242
How long did it take him to die?

79
00:12:06,246 --> 00:12:09,486
I'd have to cut him open,
but I'd say five hours.

80
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:14,393
The size and precision of the wounds...

81
00:12:15,185 --> 00:12:18,959
...indicate that he wanted
his victim conscious...

82
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,922
...but in the greatest possible state of pain.

83
00:12:34,272 --> 00:12:37,466
Check every prison,
every loony bin and sect.

84
00:12:37,599 --> 00:12:39,715
Every trail, refuge and ski slope.

85
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:44,368
Run random identity checks on drivers
in a 160 kilometre radius.

86
00:12:44,501 --> 00:12:48,901
Dig up evidence of similar mutilations
in the past 20 years.

87
00:12:49,076 --> 00:12:52,151
Talk to possible witnesses
and Callois's colleagues.

88
00:12:52,318 --> 00:12:54,470
Anyone who knew his itinerary.

89
00:12:54,647 --> 00:12:57,639
Find out where it rained
in the past two days.

90
00:12:57,932 --> 00:13:02,248
Find anything: witnesses, clues....
You have two hours.

91
00:13:33,652 --> 00:13:35,271
Doctor CHERNEZE - OPHTHALMOLOGIST

92
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:09,823
Who's there?

93
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,603
Who's there?

94
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,060
Who is it?

95
00:14:19,017 --> 00:14:20,129
Why won't you talk?

96
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:22,757
Doctor!

97
00:14:24,507 --> 00:14:25,334
-Who are you?
-What's going on?

98
00:14:26,336 --> 00:14:27,909
Get the dog out of here.

99
00:14:28,373 --> 00:14:31,153
It's nothing. Go home.
Everything's all right.

100
00:14:31,867 --> 00:14:33,143
See you on Tuesday.

101
00:14:34,944 --> 00:14:35,688
Who are you?

102
00:14:36,358 --> 00:14:39,846
Commissioner Niemans.
Sorry, dogs scare me shitless.

103
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:44,298
Dogs are not to fear. Just their masters.

104
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,115
How can I help you?

105
00:14:53,448 --> 00:14:55,813
I'm investigating Remy Callois's death.

106
00:14:57,273 --> 00:14:58,763
I heard about it.

107
00:15:00,184 --> 00:15:01,460
How awful.

108
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,000
Did you know him?

109
00:15:05,673 --> 00:15:07,659
I knew his father.

110
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:10,990
We went to college together.

111
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,228
Did you teach at the college?

112
00:15:16,484 --> 00:15:17,974
For 20 years.

113
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,627
But I stopped teaching in 1982.

114
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,000
Why?

115
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,449
Difference of opinion.

116
00:15:32,369 --> 00:15:33,362
With the Dean?

117
00:15:33,824 --> 00:15:38,472
I don't understand.
What's the link between me and Remy?

118
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,629
I have some pictures
I'd like your opinion of.

119
00:15:47,463 --> 00:15:49,166
He was tortured?

120
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,199
For several hours.

121
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,276
How horrible....

122
00:15:57,277 --> 00:15:58,849
I didn't know.

123
00:16:03,514 --> 00:16:05,051
No hands?

124
00:16:05,219 --> 00:16:06,625
Nor eyes.

125
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:10,412
That's why I'm here.
To understand these mutilations.

126
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,368
How would I know?

127
00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:14,739
What exactly do you treat?

128
00:16:15,157 --> 00:16:18,232
Genetic afflictions concerning the eyes.

129
00:16:19,731 --> 00:16:23,798
Hereditary diseases transmitted
from one generation to the next.

130
00:16:24,263 --> 00:16:27,705
They strike isolated areas
and with the college....

131
00:16:27,881 --> 00:16:29,252
What about the college?

132
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,944
Teachers have been marrying
among themselves for ages.

133
00:16:33,203 --> 00:16:35,983
The bloodlines are weak, worn out.

134
00:16:37,071 --> 00:16:39,389
Genetic problems keep popping up.

135
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,552
The ransom of the elite.

136
00:16:43,432 --> 00:16:47,005
I thought the professors' kids
were prodigies.

137
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,415
They are.

138
00:16:50,211 --> 00:16:51,701
I don't get it.

139
00:16:54,992 --> 00:16:56,943
Over the past two generations...

140
00:16:57,404 --> 00:16:59,556
...the situation has reversed.

141
00:17:01,023 --> 00:17:03,967
The native mountain children
are getting sick.

142
00:17:05,139 --> 00:17:07,172
Like the boy you just saw.

143
00:17:11,376 --> 00:17:16,071
Could there be a connection
between the mutilations and the diseases?

144
00:17:19,152 --> 00:17:23,267
Hands and eyes are the body parts
that belong to us alone.

145
00:17:24,724 --> 00:17:27,881
They're different from anyone else's,
like with DNA.

146
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,706
They're our biological identity.

147
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:37,445
Your killer is giving you hints
as to his motive.

148
00:17:41,897 --> 00:17:44,049
And he starts stabbing away.

149
00:17:44,226 --> 00:17:46,757
He stabs the dog, stabs the guy...

150
00:17:47,345 --> 00:17:50,171
...grabs the bag
and throws the knife under the car!

151
00:17:50,338 --> 00:17:52,739
Seriously, Paris is full of psychos!

152
00:17:52,917 --> 00:17:54,158
The subway! The cops!

153
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,441
RoboCops!
"Hand over your ticket, please!"

154
00:17:57,615 --> 00:18:00,064
What the hell? I'm happy with my cows!

155
00:18:00,236 --> 00:18:04,966
I'm happy here! Fresh air!
It's amazing here.

156
00:18:05,142 --> 00:18:06,928
Take a look at my cows!

157
00:18:07,388 --> 00:18:09,007
Paris sucks.

158
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,830
Kids doing this shit!

159
00:18:17,284 --> 00:18:19,400
-It's the County Mounties!
-Hi, kids.

160
00:18:19,571 --> 00:18:21,439
-How's it hanging?
-What's up?

161
00:18:21,608 --> 00:18:23,725
Cool it....

162
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,712
Can we go now?

163
00:18:27,721 --> 00:18:29,672
Happy squirrel hunting!

164
00:18:56,828 --> 00:18:58,366
You want the roach?

165
00:19:00,613 --> 00:19:01,724
You smoke?

166
00:19:02,734 --> 00:19:05,015
-I always have.
-You didn't before!

167
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:06,593
Now I do.

168
00:19:07,017 --> 00:19:08,636
You're smoking on duty.

169
00:19:08,805 --> 00:19:10,210
He does.

170
00:19:10,384 --> 00:19:12,088
You're lower on the totem pole.

171
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,662
Where does that put you?

172
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:17,989
Harry and Sally!
Why did you come for me?

173
00:19:18,161 --> 00:19:20,313
The cemetery got robbed last night.

174
00:19:20,489 --> 00:19:22,227
The word is "desecrated."

175
00:19:22,402 --> 00:19:24,850
The elementary school got desecrated, too.

176
00:19:25,021 --> 00:19:27,173
The word is "robbed", dick wad.

177
00:19:27,683 --> 00:19:30,296
Two in a day!
We're back in business, guys!

178
00:19:30,927 --> 00:19:34,699
Let's start with the cemetery.
I'm riding high today.

179
00:19:35,334 --> 00:19:36,788
Pass the joint.

180
00:19:38,203 --> 00:19:39,740
-What now?
-Nothing!

181
00:19:39,908 --> 00:19:41,978
-You're sulking.
-Because you're smoking!

182
00:19:42,154 --> 00:19:44,057
Do I sulk when you drink?

183
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:46,597
Cut the crap!
You sound like two old hookers.

184
00:19:59,784 --> 00:20:03,226
You're here for the desecration.
Follow me.

185
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:04,929
I'm okay.

186
00:20:05,107 --> 00:20:07,058
It's the girl's mausoleum.

187
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,044
The only mausoleum in the cemetery.

188
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:12,964
When I got here this morning...

189
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,822
...this is what I found.

190
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:22,567
It's those skinheads.
They're always hanging around here!

191
00:20:25,232 --> 00:20:28,389
-We have skinheads?
-Not skinheads. Just kids.

192
00:20:28,725 --> 00:20:31,634
-Kiddie skinheads?
-Just kid kids.

193
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,170
Did this ever happen before?

194
00:20:35,337 --> 00:20:37,371
The first time.

195
00:20:51,221 --> 00:20:53,622
"1972 - 1982."

196
00:20:54,673 --> 00:20:56,789
She didn't make it too far.

197
00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:01,616
Stop that! You have no right.

198
00:21:01,783 --> 00:21:04,775
You need her parents' say-so.
I know the law!

199
00:21:04,943 --> 00:21:07,179
Relax. No problem.

200
00:21:07,355 --> 00:21:09,223
Where can I find the parents?

201
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,633
Her mother was crazy.

202
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:14,081
She said the devil killed her kid.

203
00:21:15,256 --> 00:21:16,084
The devil?

204
00:21:16,254 --> 00:21:17,495
You heard me.

205
00:21:22,325 --> 00:21:25,068
Judith HERAULT
14 April 1972 - 23 September 1982

206
00:21:28,313 --> 00:21:30,015
Where are your skinheads?

207
00:21:30,184 --> 00:21:31,922
A warehouse in town.

208
00:21:32,305 --> 00:21:34,208
Let's pay them a little visit.

209
00:21:34,342 --> 00:21:37,453
First the school.
The principal's expecting us.

210
00:21:38,043 --> 00:21:38,871
What's she missing?

211
00:21:39,956 --> 00:21:42,948
Nothing's missing.
That's what's so strange.

212
00:21:43,407 --> 00:21:45,973
I've never seen you. Are you new here?

213
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,012
Is it that obvious?

214
00:21:48,189 --> 00:21:50,425
What did you do to end up here?

215
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:54,255
Cops are like teachers.
We can't always choose our school.

216
00:21:54,427 --> 00:21:58,116
Tell me about it! For 14 years,
I've asked to be transferred!

217
00:21:58,252 --> 00:21:59,659
Now it's too late.

218
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,802
They broke in here,
where we keep school records.

219
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:13,008
They went about it extremely carefully.

220
00:22:23,618 --> 00:22:25,935
Are you sure nothing's missing?

221
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:29,518
Nothing at all. I checked this morning.
It's so weird!

222
00:22:29,688 --> 00:22:31,060
I don't understand.

223
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,010
Okay.

224
00:22:35,343 --> 00:22:38,289
File a complaint at the station
this afternoon.

225
00:22:38,628 --> 00:22:40,248
So the investigation's over?

226
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:43,279
What can I say? No theft, no investigation.

227
00:22:43,868 --> 00:22:45,984
Have a nice day. Goodbye.

228
00:22:47,111 --> 00:22:48,518
Goodbye, Detective.

229
00:22:48,692 --> 00:22:51,388
"Detective" is passé.
It's "Lieutenant" now.

230
00:23:05,366 --> 00:23:08,228
Just a second!
How long have you been here?

231
00:23:08,402 --> 00:23:10,056
Not as long as you seem to think.

232
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:12,932
If I say a name, could it ring a bell?

233
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,176
Try me.

234
00:23:14,348 --> 00:23:16,002
Judith Herault.

235
00:23:16,801 --> 00:23:18,705
Was she one of my students?

236
00:23:18,881 --> 00:23:20,370
She died in 1982.

237
00:23:20,543 --> 00:23:23,027
-Should I check?
-I'd appreciate it.

238
00:23:23,912 --> 00:23:25,780
You think there's a connection?

239
00:23:26,365 --> 00:23:28,187
You tell me.

240
00:23:30,856 --> 00:23:34,546
I wonder if she's the one who got run over.

241
00:23:34,723 --> 00:23:35,586
Run over?

242
00:23:35,762 --> 00:23:39,287
Killed in a highway accident.
It was terrible.

243
00:23:39,463 --> 00:23:40,409
What else?

244
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:44,275
It was a truck. The mother was there.
She became insane.

245
00:23:44,453 --> 00:23:46,486
How can I find the mother?

246
00:23:46,657 --> 00:23:47,934
What's wrong?

247
00:23:48,403 --> 00:23:52,224
The pages are torn out.
The pages from '81 and '82.

248
00:23:52,894 --> 00:23:54,006
Bingo!

249
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:58,165
Any pictures?
Class photos, stuff like that.

250
00:24:02,084 --> 00:24:04,035
The pictures are missing, too.

251
00:24:11,523 --> 00:24:12,599
I'll be right back.

252
00:24:20,588 --> 00:24:21,865
What's the problem?

253
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,537
Any highway patrolmen here?

254
00:24:24,871 --> 00:24:27,236
Not one. They're all out to lunch.

255
00:24:28,946 --> 00:24:30,353
What for?

256
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:33,093
I need some info. I'm a cop myself.

257
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:36,590
Information about what?

258
00:24:36,764 --> 00:24:40,335
An accident that happened
around here 20 years ago.

259
00:24:41,337 --> 00:24:43,903
It's your lucky day.
They call me "gravedigger".

260
00:24:44,414 --> 00:24:47,820
Over the past 27 years,
I've seen 248, no, wait...

261
00:24:47,949 --> 00:24:50,515
...249 accidents entailing deaths.

262
00:24:50,693 --> 00:24:53,720
On our part of the highway alone.
30 kilometres!

263
00:24:53,895 --> 00:24:56,887
Cops and firemen get all the attention.

264
00:24:57,056 --> 00:24:59,456
But we're the first guys on the scene.

265
00:24:59,634 --> 00:25:02,330
It's all in here.
What do you want to know?

266
00:25:02,503 --> 00:25:05,199
-You can use that?
-What do you think?

267
00:25:05,372 --> 00:25:09,985
I'm looking for the parents
of a girl killed in '82. Judith Herault.

268
00:25:10,861 --> 00:25:12,647
That sounds familiar.

269
00:25:13,398 --> 00:25:15,846
-Judith Herault...
-H-E-R-A-U-L-T.

270
00:25:19,011 --> 00:25:22,452
Search by victim's name - Judith Herault

271
00:25:23,586 --> 00:25:24,827
Here we go....

272
00:25:26,496 --> 00:25:27,951
"Judith Herault....

273
00:25:29,075 --> 00:25:33,473
"Kilometre marker 98. September '82."
She was that kid?

274
00:25:33,773 --> 00:25:35,228
That's right.

275
00:25:35,477 --> 00:25:36,589
Just a sec.

276
00:25:38,306 --> 00:25:41,333
1982. It's coming back now.

277
00:25:42,796 --> 00:25:47,243
She was run over by a semi....

278
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:48,440
That's it.

279
00:25:50,156 --> 00:25:52,438
What a goddamned mess!

280
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,182
Here she is.

281
00:25:56,061 --> 00:25:59,301
Here's her file,
with the policemen's statements...

282
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:03,953
...pictures and all.
I'm warning you. The pictures are....

283
00:26:04,668 --> 00:26:05,497
Don't worry.

284
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:13,061
I warned you.

285
00:26:15,688 --> 00:26:18,052
Jesus! What happened?

286
00:26:18,224 --> 00:26:21,299
A 38-ton truck going 120 kilometres
an hour.

287
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:25,042
How did you identify her?

288
00:26:25,211 --> 00:26:28,900
When we got there,
the mother was at the side of the road.

289
00:26:29,202 --> 00:26:31,402
-She was holding....
-What?

290
00:26:32,321 --> 00:26:33,314
A finger.

291
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,715
The only piece of her daughter still intact.

292
00:26:41,469 --> 00:26:46,246
She said her kid ran away
and tried running across the highway.

293
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:47,576
God knows what happened.

294
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:49,942
You don't have the mother's number?

295
00:26:50,118 --> 00:26:52,897
Are you kidding? It's been 20 years!

296
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,683
The insurance company
sent us an address...

297
00:26:56,189 --> 00:26:59,878
...in case we came across any new leads.

298
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,675
This is too crazy!

299
00:27:14,402 --> 00:27:17,146
UNIVERSITY OF GUERNON

300
00:28:55,073 --> 00:28:56,479
The Dean's office?

301
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:58,722
That way, on your left.

302
00:29:18,567 --> 00:29:20,140
I want to see the Dean.

303
00:29:20,521 --> 00:29:22,756
I'm his assistant. How can I help?

304
00:29:22,975 --> 00:29:25,091
By getting me the Dean, now.

305
00:29:29,918 --> 00:29:31,195
Who shall I say is here?

306
00:29:31,374 --> 00:29:32,911
Commissioner Niemans.

307
00:29:35,449 --> 00:29:37,352
Commissioner Niemans for you.

308
00:29:40,689 --> 00:29:43,385
Have a seat. I'll just be a minute.

309
00:30:03,476 --> 00:30:07,378
I'm a slave to this university.
I never have enough time.

310
00:30:07,842 --> 00:30:08,752
What can I do?

311
00:30:09,505 --> 00:30:11,538
I'm investigating Callois's death.

312
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,411
I spoke to Captain Dahmane.

313
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:16,356
Tell me about Remy's private life.

314
00:30:16,532 --> 00:30:18,105
Do you work with Dahmane?

315
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:22,099
Neither with nor without.
I lead a special unit.

316
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:26,298
It's you.

317
00:30:27,177 --> 00:30:29,412
I don't understand what happened.

318
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:32,743
Remy never posed the slightest problem.

319
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:37,197
He was kind, hardworking.
His parents were close friends.

320
00:30:38,654 --> 00:30:41,599
He took over his father's job in the library.

321
00:30:42,147 --> 00:30:43,518
He went to school here?

322
00:30:43,685 --> 00:30:45,259
Like most of us.

323
00:30:45,432 --> 00:30:48,045
Many students are born and grow up here.

324
00:30:48,218 --> 00:30:51,127
Some become professors like their parents.

325
00:30:51,253 --> 00:30:53,157
It's sort of the tradition.

326
00:30:53,582 --> 00:30:55,071
It was the case with Remy.

327
00:30:56,535 --> 00:30:59,313
He didn't have a police record.

328
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:03,178
Maybe there's something we missed,
that may be of help.

329
00:31:03,312 --> 00:31:04,388
Like what?

330
00:31:05,849 --> 00:31:07,220
Someone who hated him.

331
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:10,498
Drug use, some religious conviction....

332
00:31:10,672 --> 00:31:12,541
I think you misunderstood me.

333
00:31:13,251 --> 00:31:17,236
This university is a community,
a temple of knowledge.

334
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:20,850
Everyone lives and works here
in perfect harmony.

335
00:31:21,151 --> 00:31:24,427
To accuse one of us is to accuse all of us,
including me.

336
00:31:29,467 --> 00:31:31,336
I want to visit his apartment.

337
00:31:32,419 --> 00:31:36,157
I'm afraid that's impossible.
The police sealed it off.

338
00:31:37,493 --> 00:31:39,893
I'd like to see it all the same.

339
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,010
Hubert, come here, please.

340
00:31:45,602 --> 00:31:47,635
Unfortunately, I can't join you.

341
00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:50,999
I hope you don't mind
if my son shows you the way.

342
00:31:52,379 --> 00:31:55,987
As I told you,
traditions are a way of life here.

343
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:05,264
We've been voted "Best College"
three years in a row.

344
00:32:05,436 --> 00:32:08,594
We even helped raise the national average.

345
00:32:08,763 --> 00:32:13,210
Just for fun, we calculated
the average IQ here. Guess how much.

346
00:32:13,378 --> 00:32:14,620
Twenty-four.

347
00:32:15,249 --> 00:32:16,030
Excuse me?

348
00:32:16,206 --> 00:32:18,820
Callois had room 24. Do you have the key?

349
00:32:18,992 --> 00:32:19,938
No.

350
00:32:22,651 --> 00:32:24,933
Do you have permission to go in?

351
00:32:39,326 --> 00:32:41,691
What did he do at the library?

352
00:32:41,863 --> 00:32:44,938
He was in charge of books
and seating arrangements.

353
00:32:46,602 --> 00:32:48,258
Seating arrangements?

354
00:32:48,473 --> 00:32:52,377
Our tradition is to be seated
in the same place every year.

355
00:32:52,673 --> 00:32:55,536
It's beneficial and makes seating easier.

356
00:33:42,365 --> 00:33:45,357
"Dominissimus. Simus serve.

357
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:47,852
"Ubicum que...."

358
00:33:47,978 --> 00:33:50,675
"We are the masters. We are the slaves.

359
00:33:50,847 --> 00:33:53,840
"We are everywhere. We are nowhere.

360
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:56,249
"We control the crimson rivers."

361
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:01,109
It was his Ph.D. thesis.
He'd been working on it for years.

362
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,833
-Fanny Ferreira?
-Up there.

363
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,108
-I've got to go.
-See you tomorrow.

364
00:34:48,896 --> 00:34:50,469
Fanny Ferreira?

365
00:34:52,265 --> 00:34:55,043
You discovered Remy Callois's corpse?

366
00:34:55,674 --> 00:34:56,868
Who are you?

367
00:34:57,046 --> 00:35:00,370
Pierre Niemans.
I came from Paris to investigate.

368
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,688
Paris exports cops now?

369
00:35:05,529 --> 00:35:07,184
Depends on the case.

370
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:13,095
Too bad. I like the local yokels.
Their seriousness cracks me up.

371
00:35:13,263 --> 00:35:14,458
Me, too.

372
00:35:15,259 --> 00:35:16,714
You can make a difference?

373
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:20,949
I've been trying to for 25 years.
Maybe you can help.

374
00:35:21,206 --> 00:35:22,695
I doubt it.

375
00:35:23,035 --> 00:35:27,021
I didn't see much. I scaled the cliff twice
before noticing him.

376
00:35:27,942 --> 00:35:29,480
Didn't you read my statement?

377
00:35:31,933 --> 00:35:32,961
Did....

378
00:35:33,681 --> 00:35:37,417
Did the killer have to be strong
to get the body up there?

379
00:35:37,589 --> 00:35:39,161
Not necessarily.

380
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:43,398
With know-how and good equipment,
you can lift anything, anywhere.

381
00:35:49,274 --> 00:35:50,597
What was he like?

382
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:53,881
A pretentious asshole.
Like most students here.

383
00:35:54,055 --> 00:35:56,207
I agree. It seems pretty....

384
00:35:56,384 --> 00:35:58,418
-Uptight?
-Exactly.

385
00:35:58,588 --> 00:36:01,699
A closed-circuit race course
for high-performance cars.

386
00:36:01,873 --> 00:36:03,493
If you've been around once....

387
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:06,895
I read that you're a glaciologist.
What do you do?

388
00:36:07,071 --> 00:36:08,774
I control avalanches.

389
00:36:09,109 --> 00:36:12,632
The school's in a valley,
so I try to steer them away.

390
00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:14,134
You protect the school.

391
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:15,547
I do my job.

392
00:36:15,678 --> 00:36:17,298
-Like Remy Callois.
-What?

393
00:36:19,005 --> 00:36:22,446
You went to, and work for the school,
like Remy Callois.

394
00:36:22,996 --> 00:36:25,148
-So?
-You're part of the clan.

395
00:36:25,533 --> 00:36:26,195
What clan?

396
00:36:26,615 --> 00:36:29,180
The elite composed of professors' kids.

397
00:36:31,271 --> 00:36:34,217
I have a busy day and I don't like uniforms.

398
00:36:34,556 --> 00:36:36,424
Your colleagues have my number.

399
00:36:46,533 --> 00:36:47,903
It's the pathologist.

400
00:36:48,071 --> 00:36:50,815
I got the results of the waterin his eyes.

401
00:36:50,981 --> 00:36:52,685
It's rain water. Acid rain.

402
00:36:52,853 --> 00:36:54,508
-What?
-It's pretty common.

403
00:36:55,181 --> 00:36:58,457
But we haven't had any acid rain
since the 1970s.

404
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,459
And it hasn't rained recently.

405
00:37:01,418 --> 00:37:02,873
I don't getit.

406
00:37:48,698 --> 00:37:50,684
-It's ice cold.
-Freezing.

407
00:38:01,921 --> 00:38:03,411
Hello, Sister.

408
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:06,983
I'm a police officer.

409
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,691
Does a certain Mrs. Herault reside here?

410
00:38:13,314 --> 00:38:14,473
May I ask why?

411
00:38:16,974 --> 00:38:19,919
I'm sorry. I'm afraid not. I can't say.

412
00:38:20,342 --> 00:38:22,742
Sister Andrée has been here for 17 years.

413
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,618
This concerns a relatively old incident.

414
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,233
Could I possibly see her?

415
00:38:30,613 --> 00:38:31,808
I'll see.

416
00:38:31,985 --> 00:38:33,179
Come in.

417
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,385
Wait here.

418
00:38:47,454 --> 00:38:48,565
Take off your cap....

419
00:38:57,475 --> 00:38:59,378
Where do you think you are?

420
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:01,080
My son!

421
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:03,243
Wait here.

422
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:08,324
Sister Andrée will see you.

423
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:10,937
-But I should warn you....
-About what?

424
00:39:11,114 --> 00:39:14,520
You can speak to her,
but you cannot see her.

425
00:39:14,898 --> 00:39:17,298
You can listen, but you cannot go near.

426
00:39:17,476 --> 00:39:18,671
Why not?

427
00:39:19,722 --> 00:39:21,424
The Shadows, my son.

428
00:39:21,801 --> 00:39:23,373
What about the shadows?

429
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:27,331
Sister Andrée took
the Vow of the Shadows.

430
00:39:27,497 --> 00:39:29,898
We haven't seen her for 15 years.

431
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:47,154
Sister....

432
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,181
Sister Andrée?

433
00:39:58,269 --> 00:39:59,592
Sister?

434
00:40:01,927 --> 00:40:05,085
I'm a police officer from Sarzac,
just nearby.

435
00:40:06,002 --> 00:40:08,238
Your daughter is buried there, right?

436
00:40:11,865 --> 00:40:15,390
Judith was your daughter, wasn't she?

437
00:40:19,101 --> 00:40:23,713
I'm here because last night
someone tried to open her tomb.

438
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:40,182
They're coming back.

439
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,590
Who?

440
00:40:43,884 --> 00:40:47,870
They're coming back
to complete their mission.

441
00:40:48,707 --> 00:40:50,445
Who are you talking about?

442
00:40:51,328 --> 00:40:52,781
The demons.

443
00:40:54,196 --> 00:40:58,679
They want to make sure Judith
won't cause them any more trouble.

444
00:41:07,419 --> 00:41:10,198
So it's these demons
who killed your daughter?

445
00:41:11,453 --> 00:41:14,480
Could you try being a little more explicit?

446
00:41:15,196 --> 00:41:18,223
For 18 years I've been trying to forget.

447
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:22,804
Last night...

448
00:41:23,429 --> 00:41:24,799
...your demons...

449
00:41:25,175 --> 00:41:28,995
...broke into the school
and stole Judith's class picture.

450
00:41:29,125 --> 00:41:31,787
I need your help to understand why.

451
00:41:32,993 --> 00:41:35,606
In order to erase every trace of my child.

452
00:41:37,983 --> 00:41:39,389
What for?

453
00:41:41,226 --> 00:41:43,426
To protect their secret.

454
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:48,331
What secret?

455
00:41:51,206 --> 00:41:53,772
Judith's face is a threat to them.

456
00:41:59,647 --> 00:42:02,131
Please, Sister. I'm sorry, but....

457
00:42:03,472 --> 00:42:08,037
Can you tell me the circumstances
of your daughter's death?

458
00:42:08,711 --> 00:42:10,663
My daughter fell ill.

459
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:14,153
We went to the hospital she was born in.

460
00:42:14,492 --> 00:42:17,105
Then the demons attacked us.

461
00:42:18,192 --> 00:42:20,096
They chased us.

462
00:42:20,936 --> 00:42:24,840
I wanted to run away,
to disappear with my daughter.

463
00:42:26,052 --> 00:42:27,838
But they found us.

464
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,907
No one can escape their clutches.

465
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:39,270
Where did you live before Sarzac?

466
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,421
The nightmare began in Guernon.

467
00:42:52,664 --> 00:42:55,905
Did you try calling the police for help?

468
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:58,191
I speak of demons...

469
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,893
...and you speak of police.

470
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,163
There's nothing you can do for my child.

471
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,736
Save your soul while you still can.

472
00:43:16,158 --> 00:43:17,399
Leave me now.

473
00:43:20,399 --> 00:43:22,351
I want to stop remembering.

474
00:43:25,182 --> 00:43:26,258
Forgive me.

475
00:43:50,921 --> 00:43:53,996
Glaciers are formed from years
of compacted snow.

476
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:56,530
The snow is compressed into ice.

477
00:43:57,574 --> 00:44:00,566
Each season has a corresponding stratum.

478
00:44:02,647 --> 00:44:05,260
This glacieris 200 metres deep.

479
00:44:05,433 --> 00:44:08,295
It's a huge source of water and energy.

480
00:44:11,047 --> 00:44:13,909
The water composing it
dates back centuries.

481
00:44:19,737 --> 00:44:22,102
What's the point ofstudying glaciers?

482
00:44:22,814 --> 00:44:25,179
The college powerplant has a research lab.

483
00:44:25,351 --> 00:44:29,550
This glacieris sliding.
We study the risk factorit represents.

484
00:45:43,651 --> 00:45:44,892
Here.

485
00:45:53,755 --> 00:45:56,073
How far down do we have to go?

486
00:45:56,749 --> 00:45:57,860
At least 30 metres.

487
00:46:01,738 --> 00:46:06,186
Why did you choose me?
There are great guides in the area.

488
00:46:08,059 --> 00:46:11,335
They say you're the best.
And you were available.

489
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,666
You enlist civilians to find murderers?

490
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:18,494
Let's say I'm picking you up.

491
00:46:24,235 --> 00:46:26,600
Put this on. Don't step on the rope.

492
00:46:50,515 --> 00:46:53,080
Welcome to the time machine,
Commissioner.

493
00:47:13,468 --> 00:47:17,289
I'll compare this ice to the acid rain
you had analysed.

494
00:47:29,269 --> 00:47:31,056
We're at the right depth.

495
00:47:34,758 --> 00:47:37,419
He must have brought us here for a reason.

496
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:40,612
There must be a clue....

497
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:42,273
A trace.

498
00:47:47,691 --> 00:47:49,642
Niemans, that's dangerous!

499
00:48:05,945 --> 00:48:08,145
We can't stay here.

500
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:11,759
Water can come gushing in at any second.

501
00:48:12,099 --> 00:48:13,802
What's back there?

502
00:48:14,428 --> 00:48:16,296
Natural water canals.

503
00:48:20,873 --> 00:48:22,244
What are you doing?

504
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:26,230
Where are you going?

505
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:05,022
Where are we?

506
00:49:05,158 --> 00:49:07,061
An intra-glacial canal...

507
00:49:07,612 --> 00:49:11,183
...dug out by the water
that feeds the power plant.

508
00:49:13,101 --> 00:49:15,300
We can't stay here. It's dangerous.

509
00:49:17,591 --> 00:49:18,868
Let's go.

510
00:49:25,991 --> 00:49:27,185
What's wrong?

511
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:19,043
The Light Brigade! What'll it be, guys?

512
00:50:19,216 --> 00:50:23,415
Nothing today.
The Chief wants to see your tenants.

513
00:50:23,749 --> 00:50:25,025
In the back.

514
00:50:29,778 --> 00:50:31,397
-What's up?
-I'm coming.

515
00:50:31,566 --> 00:50:34,097
Stay here. I'll have a word with them.

516
00:50:36,888 --> 00:50:38,048
A glass of red?

517
00:50:54,644 --> 00:50:56,926
ONLY THROUGH FORCE

518
00:51:02,171 --> 00:51:03,708
Hello, gentlemen.

519
00:51:05,081 --> 00:51:07,990
I'd like to speak to the manager.

520
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,476
The head honcho.
The leader of your little group.

521
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:12,230
What for?

522
00:51:13,106 --> 00:51:15,637
Police. I'm new in the neighbourhood.

523
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:18,375
Lieutenant Max Kerkerian.
I have some questions.

524
00:51:18,554 --> 00:51:22,126
Don't bother. We know you.
We don't talk to cops.

525
00:51:22,587 --> 00:51:24,243
I'll do the talking.

526
00:51:26,454 --> 00:51:28,442
What can we do for you?

527
00:51:29,366 --> 00:51:31,979
Tell me about your whereabouts last night.

528
00:51:33,024 --> 00:51:34,053
What's the problem?

529
00:51:34,895 --> 00:51:38,503
Some kids sprayed swastikas
on a mausoleum.

530
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,134
Why ask us?

531
00:51:40,301 --> 00:51:41,496
Skinheads, swastikas....

532
00:51:41,924 --> 00:51:43,377
Swastikas, skinheads....

533
00:51:44,418 --> 00:51:46,404
No swastikas here. See any swastikas?

534
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:48,531
-What stickers?
-Swastikas.

535
00:51:49,616 --> 00:51:50,727
Hey, Kojak!

536
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:52,895
You're not skinheads?

537
00:51:53,192 --> 00:51:54,220
So what?

538
00:51:54,647 --> 00:51:57,593
-You didn't do the school?
-What school?

539
00:51:58,265 --> 00:52:01,954
You didn't hear me.
We don't talk to cops. So get lost.

540
00:52:02,132 --> 00:52:04,698
-No school for you.
-And you? What school?

541
00:52:04,835 --> 00:52:07,400
Sheriff school? You think you're cool?

542
00:52:07,579 --> 00:52:09,282
-Relax.
-Hands off!

543
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:11,188
Policeman is doing his job.

544
00:52:11,779 --> 00:52:13,434
I'm just doing my job.

545
00:52:13,609 --> 00:52:15,678
What's his job? To piss us off?

546
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:18,885
Yeah. My job is to piss off your type.

547
00:52:19,056 --> 00:52:20,511
What's our type?

548
00:52:20,886 --> 00:52:22,837
-What's our type?
-I hate fascists.

549
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:25,704
Did you figure that out all by yourself?

550
00:52:25,875 --> 00:52:27,744
Cool it!

551
00:52:27,913 --> 00:52:29,154
What's he after?

552
00:52:29,327 --> 00:52:30,698
Don't play his game!

553
00:52:30,866 --> 00:52:35,395
This is private property.
You better get out. I know the law.

554
00:52:35,856 --> 00:52:37,097
Yeah, get lost!

555
00:52:37,893 --> 00:52:39,170
Thanks for your help.

556
00:52:39,348 --> 00:52:43,121
Cops think they're so cool!
A gun and badge and you rule!

557
00:52:43,464 --> 00:52:44,624
Son of a bitch!

558
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:51,073
Watch this, greaseball.

559
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:56,973
No gun. No badge. What did he say?

560
00:52:57,145 --> 00:52:58,849
What? I'm not a cop now.

561
00:52:59,349 --> 00:53:01,584
Not a cop now? The cowboy rode off?

562
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,836
Hands off. What did he say?

563
00:53:04,173 --> 00:53:05,828
-What was it?
-Son of a bitch.

564
00:53:06,418 --> 00:53:07,282
Son of a bitch.

565
00:53:14,569 --> 00:53:17,726
Kill the motherfucker! Get him!

566
00:53:25,213 --> 00:53:27,532
What happened? Max Kerkerian winsl

567
00:53:29,621 --> 00:53:32,187
Warmed up?
Come and fight me, motherfucker.

568
00:53:34,362 --> 00:53:35,602
Come on!

569
00:53:59,768 --> 00:54:01,342
Fucking pig!

570
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:03,797
Take this!

571
00:54:06,547 --> 00:54:08,450
Watch out, he's getting his gun!

572
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:12,447
Freeze!

573
00:54:16,776 --> 00:54:18,679
Did you stick a gun at me?

574
00:54:22,098 --> 00:54:23,422
Stop, it wasn't us!

575
00:54:26,589 --> 00:54:27,535
What wasn't you?

576
00:54:27,711 --> 00:54:29,745
Last night at the cemetery.

577
00:54:30,415 --> 00:54:32,615
We saw a guy in a white Lada.

578
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:36,109
Why didn't you say so?

579
00:54:36,277 --> 00:54:38,015
You didn't ask!

580
00:54:45,966 --> 00:54:48,745
Next time you point a gun,
check for bullets.

581
00:54:49,127 --> 00:54:50,238
Asshole.

582
00:55:01,393 --> 00:55:03,261
-Great vino.
-Very tasty.

583
00:55:03,389 --> 00:55:05,920
Excellent bouquet. Really stunning.

584
00:55:08,795 --> 00:55:10,663
-What happened?
-It wasn't them.

585
00:55:10,833 --> 00:55:12,819
We never had a problem with them.

586
00:55:18,109 --> 00:55:18,972
We do now.

587
00:55:21,062 --> 00:55:22,338
What the hell?

588
00:55:22,725 --> 00:55:25,208
Son of a bitch! Come here!

589
00:55:25,428 --> 00:55:27,249
You'll be sorry!

590
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:28,996
Asshole!

591
00:55:30,542 --> 00:55:32,494
Asshole!

592
00:55:37,445 --> 00:55:38,899
What's going on?

593
00:55:39,233 --> 00:55:40,806
The keys!

594
00:55:42,394 --> 00:55:45,799
A list of every white Lada in the area.
Every single one!

595
00:55:45,969 --> 00:55:48,370
In one hour. Call me on the radio.

596
00:55:50,211 --> 00:55:51,749
Every white Lada.

597
00:55:51,915 --> 00:55:52,827
-White what?
-Lada.

598
00:55:54,202 --> 00:55:55,231
How do you spell it?

599
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:57,520
-Beats me.
-Just take a guess.

600
00:55:58,777 --> 00:55:59,853
L-A-D-A?

601
00:56:13,539 --> 00:56:14,485
Here.

602
00:56:16,491 --> 00:56:17,650
How are you doing?

603
00:56:18,778 --> 00:56:19,392
Okay.

604
00:56:19,568 --> 00:56:21,436
Sorry I got you into this.

605
00:56:25,597 --> 00:56:27,548
You think it's a serial killer?

606
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:30,828
No, a serial killer kills in order to exist.

607
00:56:31,003 --> 00:56:33,746
I'd say we're dealing with a pointer.

608
00:56:33,914 --> 00:56:35,073
A pointer?

609
00:56:35,328 --> 00:56:36,817
We go where he points.

610
00:56:38,862 --> 00:56:40,269
What for?

611
00:56:40,692 --> 00:56:41,803
What for?

612
00:56:43,353 --> 00:56:47,007
Either he's pointing us
in a direction I don't understand....

613
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:48,129
Or?

614
00:56:48,967 --> 00:56:50,421
Or he's playing with us.

615
00:56:50,588 --> 00:56:51,534
Commissioner.

616
00:56:53,374 --> 00:56:55,077
We've identified the body.

617
00:56:55,994 --> 00:56:57,153
Excuse me.

618
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:24,228
Are you out there, Chief?

619
00:57:25,891 --> 00:57:27,003
Find anything?

620
00:57:27,181 --> 00:57:31,462
We found all the Ladas.
There are 132 in the region.

621
00:57:33,085 --> 00:57:34,575
What do we do?

622
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:40,310
Anything in a town called Guernon,
with a "G"?

623
00:57:40,487 --> 00:57:42,557
Guernon?

624
00:57:43,232 --> 00:57:45,513
Guernon, yeah. One white Lada.

625
00:57:47,182 --> 00:57:48,506
Give me the name.

626
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:52,494
It belongs to Philip Sertys.

627
00:57:54,957 --> 00:57:56,744
Good job. We'll talk later.

628
00:58:04,563 --> 00:58:07,047
Don't do this to me, motherfucker!

629
00:58:07,474 --> 00:58:08,715
Fucking....

630
00:58:09,303 --> 00:58:10,758
Shit!

631
00:58:11,009 --> 00:58:12,037
Fuck!

632
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:30,793
His name is Philip Sertys.
He graduated from here.

633
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:34,127
29 years old, single.
Became a doctor at 25.

634
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:36,530
He worked in the maternity wing.

635
00:58:37,372 --> 00:58:39,902
-Did he live on campus?
-No, in town.

636
00:58:40,074 --> 00:58:41,694
Do you have his address?

637
00:58:42,652 --> 00:58:44,355
What exactly do you want?

638
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,183
To understand.

639
00:58:51,301 --> 00:58:52,212
Thanks.

640
00:58:55,127 --> 00:58:57,327
Get to work!

641
01:00:33,677 --> 01:00:35,415
Stand up, nice and slow.

642
01:00:40,996 --> 01:00:43,526
-Don't move!
-I'm a cop.

643
01:00:43,698 --> 01:00:45,318
I said I'm a cop!

644
01:00:48,646 --> 01:00:49,674
Keep it slow.

645
01:00:53,471 --> 01:00:55,753
-Give me my gun, asshole!
-Don't move!

646
01:00:55,923 --> 01:00:57,957
You're under arrest. I'm a cop!

647
01:00:59,416 --> 01:01:00,693
Give me my gun.

648
01:01:00,872 --> 01:01:03,402
They teach lock-picking at the Academy?

649
01:01:03,575 --> 01:01:04,402
Real funny.

650
01:01:07,941 --> 01:01:09,017
Commissioner Niemans.

651
01:01:10,519 --> 01:01:11,973
-Pierre Niemans?
-Yeah.

652
01:01:12,556 --> 01:01:14,508
Sorry. Couldn't you say so?

653
01:01:15,051 --> 01:01:17,500
-Why are you here?
-To see a suspect.

654
01:01:18,586 --> 01:01:19,698
What's his name?

655
01:01:20,124 --> 01:01:21,366
Philip Sertys.

656
01:01:22,495 --> 01:01:23,606
Why?

657
01:01:25,072 --> 01:01:26,444
Pierre Niemans?

658
01:01:31,351 --> 01:01:32,972
Great technique!

659
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:35,925
What are you looking for?

660
01:01:40,542 --> 01:01:41,818
Don't touch anything.

661
01:01:42,413 --> 01:01:44,529
Chill out. Can I breathe at least?

662
01:01:49,024 --> 01:01:51,057
The guy's a real dog lover.

663
01:02:09,608 --> 01:02:10,684
Judith....

664
01:02:15,221 --> 01:02:17,751
We're talking total dog freak.

665
01:02:27,405 --> 01:02:28,184
Wait!

666
01:02:30,316 --> 01:02:32,101
What's the problem? Come on!

667
01:02:34,682 --> 01:02:36,468
I can't believe it!

668
01:02:36,636 --> 01:02:38,422
Mega-Cop is scared of pooches!

669
01:02:40,212 --> 01:02:42,115
Don't worry. Come on.

670
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:43,485
Come here, sonny.

671
01:02:44,578 --> 01:02:45,689
Careful!

672
01:02:49,859 --> 01:02:51,892
That one may bite!

673
01:02:56,471 --> 01:02:58,752
-You ever stop blabbing?
-Just joking.

674
01:03:01,586 --> 01:03:03,205
Motherfuckers!

675
01:03:10,817 --> 01:03:12,354
You know what this place is?

676
01:03:12,979 --> 01:03:17,011
The lab of a guy who experiments on dogs.

677
01:03:17,137 --> 01:03:19,963
Using genetics to make a perfect fight dog.

678
01:03:20,131 --> 01:03:21,869
He has all the equipment.

679
01:03:22,127 --> 01:03:23,155
Look....

680
01:03:25,952 --> 01:03:27,855
This is really gross.

681
01:03:28,904 --> 01:03:30,146
Did you see?

682
01:03:32,481 --> 01:03:33,675
Where are you going?

683
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:35,878
Where are you going?

684
01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:38,585
To see your suspect.

685
01:03:39,093 --> 01:03:40,333
You know where he is?

686
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:50,068
So where are we going?

687
01:03:54,478 --> 01:03:56,050
What do you want Sertys for?

688
01:03:56,848 --> 01:03:58,254
Desecration. And you?

689
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:01,666
Where?

690
01:04:02,253 --> 01:04:04,619
In Sarzac, about 200 kilometres from here.

691
01:04:04,790 --> 01:04:06,115
Why do you want him?

692
01:04:06,578 --> 01:04:07,606
Sarzac.

693
01:04:09,863 --> 01:04:11,318
Where's the lighter?

694
01:04:14,604 --> 01:04:17,430
Do you never answer questions or is it me?

695
01:04:22,005 --> 01:04:23,412
Take a left.

696
01:04:25,498 --> 01:04:27,863
Okay, Chief. I'll take a left.

697
01:04:30,073 --> 01:04:32,272
This will be a barrel of laughs.

698
01:04:34,854 --> 01:04:36,722
-Sir?
-He's with me.

699
01:04:37,266 --> 01:04:38,259
So?

700
01:04:38,929 --> 01:04:42,335
Same method of strangulation.
Same killer. I'm sure.

701
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:44,368
But this guy wasn't tortured.

702
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,949
The hands aren't torture?

703
01:04:46,081 --> 01:04:48,068
They were cut off after he died.

704
01:04:48,743 --> 01:04:50,232
I don't get a thing.

705
01:04:50,572 --> 01:04:53,564
What I don't get is why
he still has his eyes.

706
01:04:54,024 --> 01:04:55,927
-Did you start the autopsy?
-Not yet.

707
01:04:56,103 --> 01:04:57,758
There are no wounds.

708
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:01,459
There must be some clue.

709
01:05:03,213 --> 01:05:04,620
What kind of clue?

710
01:05:05,126 --> 01:05:08,283
I'm not sure. But I'm sure it's here.

711
01:05:09,118 --> 01:05:10,442
We have to look.

712
01:05:12,403 --> 01:05:13,562
Hold on....

713
01:05:14,357 --> 01:05:16,061
Tweezers, please.

714
01:05:48,331 --> 01:05:49,868
You won't believe this.

715
01:05:51,199 --> 01:05:54,440
Glass eyes. Like in an eye doctor's office...

716
01:05:54,610 --> 01:05:56,229
...or at medical school.

717
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:02,048
Get your men
and meet me at Cherneze's office.

718
01:06:02,302 --> 01:06:04,205
Tell me what's going on!

719
01:06:04,381 --> 01:06:06,166
You're asking me?

720
01:06:09,828 --> 01:06:12,028
Can I know where you're going?

721
01:06:12,199 --> 01:06:14,480
Butt out. Wait for me at the station.

722
01:06:14,651 --> 01:06:17,809
You're kidding!
He's as much my witness as yours!

723
01:06:17,978 --> 01:06:21,254
I didn't make it this far
to go back empty-handed.

724
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:25,415
This isn't child's play.
I can't be your teacher.

725
01:06:25,713 --> 01:06:28,823
Stop acting like some kind of living legend!

726
01:06:28,997 --> 01:06:30,452
I can teach you, too.

727
01:06:30,619 --> 01:06:32,736
-I work alone!
-That makes two of us!

728
01:06:43,219 --> 01:06:44,212
Where are we?

729
01:06:44,383 --> 01:06:47,624
-Did you ever shoot someone?
-I never had to.

730
01:06:47,751 --> 01:06:49,205
Good. I want him alive.

731
01:06:49,373 --> 01:06:51,241
Who? Who, goddammit?

732
01:07:50,623 --> 01:07:51,783
What the fuck is this?

733
01:08:02,932 --> 01:08:04,422
What are we looking for?

734
01:08:19,274 --> 01:08:20,977
Can you tell me?

735
01:08:21,477 --> 01:08:24,043
If you talk to me, maybe I can help.

736
01:09:01,563 --> 01:09:03,349
The other stairway!

737
01:09:40,733 --> 01:09:41,726
Don't move!

738
01:10:22,482 --> 01:10:23,937
Run!

739
01:10:36,204 --> 01:10:37,232
What's happening?

740
01:12:10,605 --> 01:12:13,973
"I will track the source
of the crimson rivers."

741
01:12:15,984 --> 01:12:19,233
Would it kill you
to tell me what's going on?

742
01:12:19,695 --> 01:12:21,605
I have no idea!

743
01:12:22,865 --> 01:12:24,904
-That's an answer.
-So?

744
01:12:25,533 --> 01:12:28,284
So I'm comparing the fingerprints.

745
01:12:32,705 --> 01:12:34,330
There's no match.

746
01:12:35,166 --> 01:12:37,075
No criminal on our files.

747
01:12:37,376 --> 01:12:38,455
Shit.

748
01:12:38,878 --> 01:12:41,415
-Can you scan this print?
-No problem.

749
01:12:41,588 --> 01:12:42,868
What's that?

750
01:12:43,422 --> 01:12:45,332
A girl who died 20 years ago.

751
01:12:46,801 --> 01:12:48,544
She led me here.

752
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:50,669
What?

753
01:12:52,055 --> 01:12:54,676
If she died 20 years ago, we got a problem.

754
01:12:54,849 --> 01:12:57,137
She's the one who shot at you.

755
01:12:57,601 --> 01:13:01,597
These prints are a perfect match
with the ones on the gun...

756
01:13:01,771 --> 01:13:03,514
...except for the age difference.

757
01:13:05,607 --> 01:13:06,603
We need to talk.

758
01:13:07,651 --> 01:13:09,145
So we talk now?

759
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:15,526
Last night, Sertys went to a cemetery.

760
01:13:15,699 --> 01:13:19,281
Into the vault of Judith Herault,
who died in 1982.

761
01:13:19,452 --> 01:13:23,780
He couldn't open the coffin,
so he tried misleading us with swastikas.

762
01:13:24,038 --> 01:13:27,205
That night, someone broke
into the elementary school...

763
01:13:27,334 --> 01:13:30,583
...and stole pictures and documents
from '81 and '82...

764
01:13:31,170 --> 01:13:34,372
...the two years Judith Herault
attended that school.

765
01:13:35,382 --> 01:13:37,421
She's one of these kids.

766
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,342
How did she die?

767
01:13:39,635 --> 01:13:42,635
Run over by a truck.
They called it an accident.

768
01:13:42,804 --> 01:13:46,338
But the mother told me something
completely different.

769
01:13:46,557 --> 01:13:47,837
According to her...

770
01:13:48,809 --> 01:13:51,050
...her daughter was killed by demons.

771
01:13:52,353 --> 01:13:53,598
Demons....

772
01:13:54,938 --> 01:13:58,806
She has a major screw loose.
She's in a convent since.

773
01:13:59,817 --> 01:14:03,151
But I got the impression
she wasn't telling me all....

774
01:14:03,279 --> 01:14:05,152
Did you grill her or have tea?

775
01:14:07,407 --> 01:14:09,695
I was investigating a misdemeanour.

776
01:14:09,867 --> 01:14:13,236
I couldn't punch her to get her to talk.
She's a nun.

777
01:14:14,455 --> 01:14:15,450
Your turn.

778
01:14:15,664 --> 01:14:17,573
Tell me what's going on.

779
01:14:17,957 --> 01:14:21,705
It's a treasure hunt.
Each corpse leads to the next one.

780
01:14:24,629 --> 01:14:25,827
Let's say that...

781
01:14:26,005 --> 01:14:30,002
...Sertys, Callois and Cherneze
are linked by an incident...

782
01:14:30,175 --> 01:14:31,919
...that happened 20 years ago.

783
01:14:32,428 --> 01:14:35,262
Two days ago they learn Callois is dead.

784
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:36,924
We find the body.

785
01:14:37,222 --> 01:14:39,630
They panic. The past resurfaces.

786
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:42,465
They go to the cemetery and the school...

787
01:14:43,186 --> 01:14:46,637
...to check....
To find something....

788
01:14:47,565 --> 01:14:48,514
But what?

789
01:14:51,151 --> 01:14:53,688
-If Judith is really dead.
-Why?

790
01:14:53,862 --> 01:14:57,693
She's seeking revenge.
The nun probably faked her death.

791
01:14:58,198 --> 01:14:59,361
And the prints?

792
01:15:00,325 --> 01:15:02,281
Fingers can be cut off.

793
01:15:02,535 --> 01:15:04,823
The guy who shot at me had five fingers.

794
01:15:07,873 --> 01:15:09,247
Why did he let you live?

795
01:15:09,916 --> 01:15:12,074
So I'd understand his vengeance.

796
01:15:13,418 --> 01:15:15,376
What links the three victims?

797
01:15:16,087 --> 01:15:18,127
Callois was head librarian.

798
01:15:18,297 --> 01:15:22,710
Sertys worked in the maternity ward.
Cherneze worked with the dean.

799
01:15:22,885 --> 01:15:24,758
It all leads to the university.

800
01:15:26,763 --> 01:15:27,794
I better get back.

801
01:15:29,014 --> 01:15:30,129
What about me?

802
01:15:30,349 --> 01:15:32,056
See if Judith is dead.

803
01:15:32,351 --> 01:15:34,058
I knew you'd say that.

804
01:15:35,394 --> 01:15:36,723
I get the fun stuff.

805
01:15:46,528 --> 01:15:48,356
Call me with any news.

806
01:15:59,706 --> 01:16:01,449
What are you doing here?

807
01:16:02,375 --> 01:16:04,616
Your colleagues held me for four hours.

808
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:07,878
Sorry. Everyone's on edge.

809
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:09,579
Want a ride?

810
01:16:11,257 --> 01:16:12,420
Sure.

811
01:16:44,367 --> 01:16:46,158
So Cherneze is dead, too?

812
01:16:46,619 --> 01:16:48,029
Did you know him?

813
01:16:48,871 --> 01:16:50,946
One of the college's last dinosaurs.

814
01:16:52,582 --> 01:16:56,579
You don't seem to appreciate
the geniuses you live among.

815
01:16:56,794 --> 01:16:59,118
I don't respect intellectuals much.

816
01:17:01,255 --> 01:17:03,331
Weren't your parents professors?

817
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:07,126
I don't respect my parents much.

818
01:17:07,386 --> 01:17:08,879
Take a left here.

819
01:17:30,154 --> 01:17:31,648
Is anyone expecting you?

820
01:17:33,281 --> 01:17:35,523
You're a lousy Don Juan.

821
01:17:36,158 --> 01:17:37,274
-Thanks.
-No problem.

822
01:18:43,338 --> 01:18:44,535
JUDITH HERAULT

823
01:19:20,743 --> 01:19:22,071
Nice place.

824
01:19:22,828 --> 01:19:24,986
I like it. It's far from everything.

825
01:19:25,164 --> 01:19:27,120
No TV, no radio...

826
01:19:27,290 --> 01:19:29,247
...even cell phones don't work.

827
01:19:29,959 --> 01:19:31,287
A grenade?

828
01:19:32,128 --> 01:19:33,076
Thanks.

829
01:19:33,712 --> 01:19:36,037
I use them to trigger avalanches.

830
01:19:39,758 --> 01:19:41,383
Are all the locals like you?

831
01:19:42,552 --> 01:19:46,419
Battling mountains
helps forge your character.

832
01:19:49,266 --> 01:19:50,464
Same goes for cops.

833
01:19:51,935 --> 01:19:53,559
Have you been one for long?

834
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:56,926
Too long.

835
01:20:00,567 --> 01:20:01,941
Buy lighter fluid.

836
01:20:04,528 --> 01:20:05,642
I should.

837
01:20:06,322 --> 01:20:09,156
But I'm trying to quit. It was a gift.

838
01:20:09,574 --> 01:20:10,653
From your ex?

839
01:20:14,244 --> 01:20:16,451
I never got married. How about you?

840
01:20:17,372 --> 01:20:19,246
Almost. With the Dean's son.

841
01:20:21,166 --> 01:20:22,708
That could never work.

842
01:20:24,419 --> 01:20:26,246
It sure was intended to.

843
01:20:27,756 --> 01:20:31,456
After three years face to face
in a reading room...

844
01:20:31,592 --> 01:20:33,051
...you get close.

845
01:20:35,595 --> 01:20:37,920
Why do you hate the school so much?

846
01:20:38,514 --> 01:20:40,637
Why do you suspect me?

847
01:20:42,101 --> 01:20:43,642
You climb mountains.

848
01:20:44,477 --> 01:20:47,810
You found the first body,
helped me find the second.

849
01:20:49,898 --> 01:20:51,690
You're the perfect suspect.

850
01:20:53,693 --> 01:20:55,151
Except for one thing.

851
01:20:55,319 --> 01:20:56,232
What?

852
01:20:57,696 --> 01:20:58,859
You're incapable...

853
01:20:59,030 --> 01:21:02,114
...of strangling someone for 10 minutes,
eye to eye.

854
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:08,866
I have to go.

855
01:21:09,998 --> 01:21:11,372
Thanks for the tea.

856
01:22:13,090 --> 01:22:14,121
Hello.

857
01:22:15,384 --> 01:22:17,589
Tell me about Remy Callois's thesis.

858
01:22:20,846 --> 01:22:22,969
He talks about the myth of Olympus...

859
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:26,093
...Greek athletes
who combined mind and body.

860
01:22:26,810 --> 01:22:31,767
He refers a lot
to the Berlin Olympic games of 1936...

861
01:22:31,939 --> 01:22:35,770
...when German athletes
fuelled Nazi propaganda.

862
01:22:35,942 --> 01:22:37,104
And "crimson rivers"?

863
01:22:37,276 --> 01:22:39,648
Flow with the blood of perfect men.

864
01:22:40,821 --> 01:22:42,066
Blood?

865
01:22:43,532 --> 01:22:44,563
Veins....

866
01:22:45,866 --> 01:22:46,613
Commissioner.

867
01:22:47,368 --> 01:22:49,111
You want my opinion?

868
01:22:49,619 --> 01:22:54,032
Seriously, his thesis
is a potpourri of Nazi crap.

869
01:22:54,207 --> 01:22:57,492
At the end, it's like
"How To Be a Perfect Fascist."

870
01:22:57,667 --> 01:23:00,834
He explains how to create
the perfect man today.

871
01:23:01,588 --> 01:23:02,204
How?

872
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:05,831
By combining brawny kids
with brainy ones.

873
01:23:06,675 --> 01:23:09,047
By selecting them and marrying them.

874
01:23:10,178 --> 01:23:11,720
It's called....

875
01:23:12,513 --> 01:23:13,295
Eugenics.

876
01:23:13,472 --> 01:23:15,096
Eugenics, that's it.

877
01:23:15,265 --> 01:23:18,550
Like Nazis tried in some villages
during the war.

878
01:23:19,769 --> 01:23:22,889
Like at this school. Healthy minds...

879
01:23:23,481 --> 01:23:25,023
...in healthy bodies.

880
01:23:59,885 --> 01:24:02,838
What are you doing?
You have no business here!

881
01:24:03,012 --> 01:24:05,419
What role did Callois play exactly?

882
01:24:06,390 --> 01:24:07,303
Excuse me?

883
01:24:08,267 --> 01:24:11,765
Callois. Sertys. Cherneze.

884
01:24:12,061 --> 01:24:13,341
It all leads here.

885
01:24:15,605 --> 01:24:17,598
What are you after?

886
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:19,772
You suspect us, don't you?

887
01:24:21,194 --> 01:24:23,518
Victims can be guilty, too.

888
01:24:24,112 --> 01:24:25,772
Watch what you say, Niemans.

889
01:24:26,573 --> 01:24:30,023
I inquired about you.
You're on the razor's edge....

890
01:24:31,159 --> 01:24:33,780
I'd gladly put you first on the list.

891
01:24:33,954 --> 01:24:38,247
All that's stopping me is the desire
to prove you're behind it all.

892
01:24:38,416 --> 01:24:40,491
Am I wrong? Am l?

893
01:24:44,462 --> 01:24:45,493
Stop it!

894
01:24:46,130 --> 01:24:47,458
Are you crazy?

895
01:24:52,510 --> 01:24:54,134
You'll be hearing from me!

896
01:24:56,847 --> 01:24:59,172
Can't I leave you alone for a minute?

897
01:25:03,144 --> 01:25:05,053
What did you find in the tomb?

898
01:25:06,730 --> 01:25:09,101
I don't know if it'll be any help.

899
01:25:21,158 --> 01:25:22,356
It's not her.

900
01:25:23,619 --> 01:25:24,864
You know her?

901
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:28,454
-She helped with the case.
-She helped you?

902
01:25:28,623 --> 01:25:31,707
To understand the meaning
of the "crimson rivers."

903
01:25:33,001 --> 01:25:35,835
They've lived in a closed circuit here
for ages.

904
01:25:35,962 --> 01:25:40,089
Inbreeding led the professors
to start having degenerate kids.

905
01:25:40,257 --> 01:25:42,499
So they needed new blood.

906
01:25:42,676 --> 01:25:44,004
New blood?

907
01:25:44,177 --> 01:25:47,841
In the maternity wing,
they replace professors' kids...

908
01:25:48,013 --> 01:25:50,848
...with healthy newborn mountain babies.

909
01:25:52,183 --> 01:25:55,433
Sertys's father exchanged Fanny
with Judith?

910
01:25:55,687 --> 01:25:57,311
And plenty of others.

911
01:25:57,729 --> 01:25:59,140
What for?

912
01:25:59,481 --> 01:26:01,141
To create a superior race.

913
01:26:04,109 --> 01:26:05,224
Nazis?

914
01:26:06,946 --> 01:26:09,732
-A freaking Nazi college?
-Not a college.

915
01:26:10,948 --> 01:26:12,526
A breeding ground.

916
01:26:23,375 --> 01:26:24,371
Who the fuck is it?

917
01:26:33,133 --> 01:26:34,543
Shoot!

918
01:26:41,057 --> 01:26:42,384
Shoot!

919
01:26:45,977 --> 01:26:47,221
It's bullet-proof.

920
01:26:47,394 --> 01:26:49,186
Aim for the same spot.

921
01:26:49,688 --> 01:26:50,767
Go on, shoot!

922
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:52,145
Shoot!

923
01:26:53,232 --> 01:26:54,063
Watch out!

924
01:28:35,399 --> 01:28:36,478
Are you okay?

925
01:28:45,823 --> 01:28:47,697
-Who's this bastard?
-The Dean's son.

926
01:28:49,285 --> 01:28:50,280
What did he want?

927
01:28:50,452 --> 01:28:53,239
To stop us from knowing
what they did to Fanny.

928
01:28:53,412 --> 01:28:56,746
What could he do to Fanny?
He was 10 back then.

929
01:28:56,916 --> 01:29:00,747
He was exchanged.
He was seated with Fanny at the library.

930
01:29:00,918 --> 01:29:03,955
He should have married her.
That was the plan.

931
01:29:04,088 --> 01:29:07,005
So then why is she killing them all off?

932
01:29:07,132 --> 01:29:09,503
She refuses to play by their rules.

933
01:29:14,513 --> 01:29:15,888
You think she's innocent?

934
01:29:28,942 --> 01:29:30,139
My coat!

935
01:29:38,658 --> 01:29:41,611
Hold on. A la Niemans.

936
01:29:58,674 --> 01:30:01,839
Who is this babe of yours?
Lady Cliff-hanger?

937
01:30:33,785 --> 01:30:34,984
Shit!

938
01:30:43,877 --> 01:30:45,419
Are you still not sure?

939
01:30:46,170 --> 01:30:48,079
To think she brought me here!

940
01:30:48,839 --> 01:30:50,630
I could have seen it all.

941
01:30:51,508 --> 01:30:53,915
She could have operated on you, too!

942
01:30:55,511 --> 01:30:57,219
She didn't want to kill me.

943
01:30:58,180 --> 01:30:59,840
She left me alive.

944
01:31:00,932 --> 01:31:02,889
What are you talking about?

945
01:31:04,685 --> 01:31:07,769
She left you alive,
but three other guys didn't make it.

946
01:31:07,854 --> 01:31:11,223
Your girlfriend's hobby is
to cut up her boyfriends.

947
01:31:11,483 --> 01:31:12,562
Why the treasure hunt?

948
01:31:12,650 --> 01:31:17,110
What are you talking about?
She's a schizoid! A psycho-killer!

949
01:31:18,071 --> 01:31:19,730
She wants us to understand.

950
01:31:20,407 --> 01:31:23,158
-What's to understand?
-She wants to get caught.

951
01:31:26,661 --> 01:31:29,199
Good news. That's our job, right?

952
01:31:30,081 --> 01:31:31,789
Now we just have to find her.

953
01:31:33,583 --> 01:31:35,375
That's our job.

954
01:31:52,390 --> 01:31:53,849
What now?

955
01:31:54,558 --> 01:31:55,969
She took the grenades.

956
01:31:56,143 --> 01:31:57,306
What grenades?

957
01:31:59,939 --> 01:32:02,428
Closed up like a fucking clam....

958
01:32:23,791 --> 01:32:25,332
Did you evacuate the college?

959
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:27,576
I need an explanation first!

960
01:32:27,753 --> 01:32:30,919
It's not the time for explanations.
Evacuate.

961
01:32:31,589 --> 01:32:33,581
This can't go on. Who's up there?

962
01:32:34,383 --> 01:32:36,671
-I go alone.
-It's everyone or no one!

963
01:32:36,843 --> 01:32:38,336
I'm going alone.

964
01:32:38,928 --> 01:32:40,208
Everyone, freeze!

965
01:32:40,346 --> 01:32:41,176
Calm down....

966
01:32:41,305 --> 01:32:42,716
No one is coming.

967
01:32:43,348 --> 01:32:44,723
Have you gone berserk?

968
01:32:44,891 --> 01:32:45,637
Give me that.

969
01:32:48,603 --> 01:32:50,180
Trust me.

970
01:33:00,695 --> 01:33:01,976
Lower your guns.

971
01:33:39,394 --> 01:33:41,385
We have to go all the way now.

972
01:33:44,856 --> 01:33:46,315
Leave her to me.

973
01:34:09,709 --> 01:34:10,872
Down there!

974
01:34:23,929 --> 01:34:25,720
Fanny, turn around.

975
01:34:26,390 --> 01:34:27,552
Come down.

976
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:33,476
This is the end. It's over now.

977
01:34:34,062 --> 01:34:35,556
I know who you are.

978
01:34:35,730 --> 01:34:36,976
You know nothing!

979
01:34:37,148 --> 01:34:40,065
Stop it! I know what they did to you.

980
01:34:40,234 --> 01:34:42,190
Exchanging newborn babies.

981
01:34:42,319 --> 01:34:44,394
Killing kids. I know.

982
01:34:44,571 --> 01:34:47,405
It's too late. You can't help. Go away!

983
01:34:47,573 --> 01:34:51,072
You led me here. I can't turn back.

984
01:34:51,243 --> 01:34:53,282
-Neither can l!
-Don't do that!

985
01:34:53,411 --> 01:34:56,910
They'll close down the college.
They're all dead now.

986
01:34:57,456 --> 01:35:00,576
-You'll kill innocent people.
-They're all guilty!

987
01:35:06,881 --> 01:35:08,209
No one is innocent!

988
01:35:10,258 --> 01:35:11,040
Judith?

989
01:35:13,177 --> 01:35:14,291
Twins!

990
01:35:15,220 --> 01:35:16,715
They exchanged twins!

991
01:35:17,056 --> 01:35:18,087
Just one.

992
01:35:18,515 --> 01:35:21,350
That's why her face was a threat to them.

993
01:35:22,351 --> 01:35:23,679
Take care of her.

994
01:35:26,062 --> 01:35:28,351
So who died in the car accident?

995
01:35:28,523 --> 01:35:30,349
What about the fingerprint?

996
01:35:31,484 --> 01:35:32,728
Mommy prepared it all.

997
01:35:33,277 --> 01:35:35,353
The other girl was already dead.

998
01:35:35,695 --> 01:35:37,604
Mommy planned everything.

999
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:40,320
Except your going haywire.

1000
01:35:40,449 --> 01:35:41,563
You thought you'd make it?

1001
01:35:41,742 --> 01:35:43,402
I don't intend to make it.

1002
01:35:43,577 --> 01:35:46,067
Freeze, or you really won't make it.

1003
01:35:48,330 --> 01:35:48,828
Stop!

1004
01:35:49,165 --> 01:35:49,911
Leave her alone!

1005
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,909
I'll trigger an avalanche.

1006
01:35:55,294 --> 01:35:56,373
Listen to me.

1007
01:35:56,837 --> 01:35:57,620
Stay away!

1008
01:35:57,797 --> 01:36:02,541
The men who hurt you are all dead.
If you do this, they'll win.

1009
01:36:15,019 --> 01:36:16,893
Only you can stop her, Fanny.

1010
01:36:17,062 --> 01:36:20,929
You're not a monster like her.
Stop before it's too late.

1011
01:36:22,024 --> 01:36:23,816
-I have no choice.
-You do.

1012
01:36:23,984 --> 01:36:24,565
Stop!

1013
01:36:30,531 --> 01:36:31,445
Kill him.

1014
01:36:38,162 --> 01:36:40,653
For our lives. For those of our parents.

1015
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:43,709
For the lives they stole from us.

1016
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:46,791
Kill him.

1017
01:36:46,961 --> 01:36:48,704
-Not him. He's innocent.
-Kill him!

1018
01:36:51,173 --> 01:36:54,208
Do it for me. For the life I never had.

1019
01:36:54,384 --> 01:36:56,292
A life in your shadow.

1020
01:36:56,427 --> 01:37:00,637
They created you.
And they rejected me. Do it.

1021
01:37:00,806 --> 01:37:02,003
Kill him, Fanny.

1022
01:37:03,141 --> 01:37:03,757
Do it!

1023
01:37:05,477 --> 01:37:07,551
You wanted him to understand.

1024
01:37:08,353 --> 01:37:09,681
You can't do that.

1025
01:37:10,856 --> 01:37:12,433
It's you and me.

1026
01:37:12,732 --> 01:37:13,681
You and me.

1027
01:37:16,568 --> 01:37:17,398
Go on.

1028
01:37:19,654 --> 01:37:20,436
Go on!

1029
01:37:21,573 --> 01:37:22,652
Don't.

1030
01:37:23,908 --> 01:37:24,903
You're not like her.

1031
01:37:25,326 --> 01:37:26,274
But I am.

1032
01:37:26,451 --> 01:37:27,281
Kill him!

1033
01:37:28,327 --> 01:37:28,943
Do it!

1034
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:41,588
You had to understand,
so no one could forget.

1035
01:37:41,755 --> 01:37:43,664
I know.

1036
01:37:55,308 --> 01:37:56,387
Hurry!

1037
01:38:40,094 --> 01:38:41,257
Take her feet!

1038
01:40:37,772 --> 01:40:39,432
That's enough. I'm fine.

1039
01:40:40,274 --> 01:40:41,768
Thanks, doggy. That's enough.

1040
01:40:42,693 --> 01:40:43,356
I've had it!

1041
01:40:46,904 --> 01:40:48,482
Can I ask a question?

1042
01:40:53,326 --> 01:40:55,319
What do you have against dogs?

1043
01:41:00,749 --> 01:41:02,124
It was a long time ago....
