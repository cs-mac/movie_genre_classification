1
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,240
Number 14...

2
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,200
Eliza Naumann, Oakland Tribune,
Oakland, California.

3
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,000
- "Oppidan."
- "Oppidan."

4
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,440
My father told me once...

5
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,640
that words and letters hold all
the secrets of the universe.

6
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,880
That in their shapes and sounds...

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,680
I could find everything
and see beyond myself...

8
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,200
to something special...

9
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,800
perfect.

10
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,240
My father told me once...

11
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,280
that I could reach
the ear of God.

12
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,320
Eliza?

13
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,400
"Nozzle."

14
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,520
From KQED public radio,
this is "The California Report."

15
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,920
I'm Scott Shaffer. On today's show,
people from all over the country-

16
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,480
... thousands of
supermarket clerks are on the picket line.

17
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,800
70,000 union workers at Vons-

18
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,200
...walked off thejob late Saturday
after contract negotiations fell through.

19
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,120
At issue are-

20
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,000
Ron says the Alfa's
gonna be ready this afternoon.

21
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,200
- Great.
- So I'll pick it up and stop for groceries.

22
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,120
- Okay.
- Hey.

23
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,440
Hey, what are you doing?
That's my breakfast.

24
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,360
- This is terrible stuff. How do you eat this?

25
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,680
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah, see you.

26
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,680
- Bye. Thanks for the ride.
-  Okay, bye-bye.

27
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,600

Bye.

28
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,720
- Got your lunch?
- Mm-hmm.

29
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,720
Bye, sweetheart.
I'll call after school.

30
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,600
- Okay.
- Okay. Bye-bye.

31
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,360
Thanks, Mom.

32
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,960

Hey, wait up.

33
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,760

Eliza, let's try "possibility."

34
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,200

"Possibility."

35
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,120
P-O-S-S-I...

36
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,040
B-l-L...

37
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,120
- l-T-Y. "Possibility."
- Correct.

38
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,400
Courtney. "Graphite."

39
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,280
- Correct.
-  O-R-O-W-

40
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,200
-  That's incorrect.
-  L-l-

41
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,320
 Incorrect. I'm sorry.
You're excused.

42
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,240
-  C-L-T-
-  "Placebo."

43
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,360
- P-L-A-
-  "Random." "Indemnity."

44
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,800
- L-N-
- "Flux."

45
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,400
- "Flux."
- "Fluorescent."

46
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,480
-  F-L-U-O-
-  'Archaeology."

47
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,960

A-R-C-H-A-E...

48
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,560
- O-L-O-G-Y.
-

49
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,920
 Who's going to
be handling it? Who do we have this year?

50
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,880
We've got Louis, Thomas-
We've got-So, that's James.

51
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,520
Uh, "Aspects of Biblical Religion."
Ron usually takes that.

52
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,280
Look again. Uh, 190.

53
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,600
Topics in Religious Studies,
the Upanishads.

54
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,520
I could do that or-

55
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,840
- Coffee? Thanks.
- On the stove.

56
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,000
 You know that dinner
of yours? We used every pot in the house.

57
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,480
- That wasn't worth washing a pot or two?
- Or 10.

58
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,520
- What's this?
- He's helping her with Hebrew school.

59
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,040
 Do you understand
a word you're saying?

60
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,240
- I understand a lot of it.
- Yeah? Okay.

61
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,720
- Translate, hotshot.
- Um, it's about where Abraham sacrifices-

62
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,680
- No, not sacrifices.
...uh, starts-

63
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,760
- Yes?
...to sacrifice Isaac to God?

64
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,120
- Yes?
...to sacrifice Isaac to God?

65
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,280
- You're being a bully.
- A bully?

66
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,760
Maybe, but why shouldn't
he know what he's saying?

67
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:02,640
Isn't God in the words?
See, God is the words.

68
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,120
The spoken words,
the utterances.

69
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,760
How do we reach
the ear of God, Aaron?

70
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,520
Exactly. You speak with him. It's ridiculous.

71
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,440
MostJews don't understand
what they're saying in services.

72
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,640
Well, that's what attracted me.
The mystery of it all.

73
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,480
- I thought it was Dad's cooking. 
- Very clever.

74
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,440
You missed a spot.

75
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,360
You're slipping. Come on. Let's go.
Let's play. Let's go.

76
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,080
- Come on.
- We'll finish this later.

77
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,840
Hey, what do you think
about changing the tempo-

78
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,120
I love this piece.
You been working on this?

79
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,640
- 
- Good night, honey.

80
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,960
- Hey.
- Could you drive me somewhere?

81
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,680

So, uh, what is this again?

82
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,080
 I told you already.
The district spelling bee.

83
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,160
Don't you have to win
your school bee to be in that?

84
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,200
- Uh-huh.
- God, Elly, that's great.

85
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,840
Wow. I'm totally impressed.

86
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,840
Dad must be in Dad heaven.

87
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,720
- He doesn't care.
- How can you say that? He loves this stuff.

88
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,240
I put the letter under his door.
He never said anything.

89
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,840
I'm sorry.

90
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,240
 The spelling bee
is a truly American tradition.

91
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,280
I'd like to welcome you to the
Oakland Tribune District Bee.

92
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,960
Spellers, be proud.

93
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,200
You are examples of the best
and brightest in our area.

94
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,520

"Sequel."

95
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,800
"Sequel."

96
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,080
S-E-Q-U...

97
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,760
- E-L.
- Correct.

98
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,400
- 
-  "Orangutan."

99
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,080
O-

100
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,040
 "Turpitude."
"Fresco." "Homonym."

101
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,000
Hom- Homonym.

102
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,920
H-O...

103
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,160
M-O-N-Y-M.

104
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,120

Correct.

105
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,040

"Coyote."

106
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,560
- "Coyote." C-O-Y-
- "Affix."

107
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,320
"Susurration."

108
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,240
"Dendroid." "Extenuate."
"Notorious."

109
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,160
'Anvil. " "Hydrofoil. "
"Graduate."

110
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,600
- "Oasis."
- "Hoodlum."

111
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,320
"Macramé."

112
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,280
M-A-C...

113
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,160
R-A-M-

114
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,680
...A- Y?
- Incorrect.

115
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,080

S-A-L-I...

116
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,840
N-E. "Saline."

117
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:14,440

So, a paradox.

118
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,400

So, a paradox.

119
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,800
God is... everything-

120
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,320
a perfect, luminous essence.

121
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,880
But even God wants more-
to experience more, to give.

122
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,800
So God creates a vessel,
a container...

123
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,720
that can receive this...
gift of God's pure light.

124
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,640
His divine light
pours into the vessel.

125
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,640
- Come stand here.
- The vessel, of course...

126
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,280
- can't contain the magnitude
of this light, and it shatters.


127
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,800
Destroying the vessel,
and scattering its broken shards...

128
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,560
in a big bang of creation.

129
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,800
Now, man's job is to locate
and gather these shards...

130
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,600
to make the vessel-
our world- whole again.

131
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,640
Now the cabalists called
this fixing, this mending-

132
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,080
they called it...

133
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,080
Tikkun-

134
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,080
Tikkun olam, the fixing of the world.

135
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,000
Now, any act of goodness,
altruism, kindness...

136
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,000
that contributes to that idea
is considered tikkun olam.

137
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,920
It's an extraordinary idea- that we
can restore what has been shattered.

138
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,880
In fact, it's our responsibility
to try, each of us.

139
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,640
Out of the very pieces
of the destruction...

140
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,480
God has left us hope.

141
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,000
Polytheism papers due next Tuesday.

142
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,320
 Elly, this is fantastic.
Why didn't you tell me?

143
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,760
- I did, but you didn't say anything.
- Hmm?

144
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,680
She thinks you've
been ignoring it.

145
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,280
- I put the letter under your door.
- What letter, honey?

146
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,720
- From Dr. Morris.
- Dr. Morris?

147
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,720
It's probably in the mess
on your floor, Dad.

148
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,120
- I'm really sorry. I didn't see that letter.
- She beat out a lot of kids.

149
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,040
- Yeah?
- You'd have loved it.

150
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,960

Did you do that?

151
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,040
Oh, man.


152
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,360
I got another chance now, don't I? Because
you moved up to that next level, right?

153
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,840
- The regional bee in Sacramento.
- Oh, perfect.

154
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:30,160
Perfect. We'll all go. This is really,
really important, and this-

155
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,160
This is a beautiful thing.

156
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,000
Let's take this home.
We'll show it to your mom, all right?

157
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,920
We'll put the top down
on the Alfa.

158
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,880
Wow, what a great day!

159
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,080
It's okay.

160
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,240
Go with Dad.

161
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,160
I'll, uh, see you at home.

162
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,960
Okay, in the Chronicle, the Trib
and the Montclarion. Listen to this.

163
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,240
-  Wow.
- "Winner of the spelling bee...

164
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,440
"that took place Saturday afternoon
at Albany High School...

165
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,600
was sixth grader
Eliza Naumann."

166
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,520
"Sixth Grader Bests
Middle Schoolers."

167
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,360

Let me see.

168
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,000
- That's great. I'm proud of you.
- "Naumann casts a spell."

169
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,520
- You know, you've always been good at spelling.
- Yeah, but not this good.

170
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,600
- It's not important.
-  Of course it's important.

171
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,600
You know, there are people
who believe...

172
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,480
that letters are expression
of a very special primal energy...

173
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,080
and when they combine
to make words, they-

174
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,480
they hold all the secrets
of the universe.

175
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,560
You remember the Vikings?

176
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,920
Okay, the Vikings
called this epli.

177
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,120
Now, when they took it across the sea
in their ships, it became apfel.

178
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,160
Across another border,
it became appel.

179
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,680
By the time it got to us,
it was "apple."

180
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,160
A-P-P-L-E. Its spelling
contains all of that.

181
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,760
It holds its history inside it.

182
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,040
Yeah, but that's not the secret
of the universe.

183
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,840
- Isn't it?
-  Yes, thanks.

184
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,920
"Miss Naumann, youngest district
spelling champion ever."

185
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,480
- You know that?
- Mm-mmm.

186
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,560
Wow. Mimi?

187
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,560
Mim, we're all going to Sacramento
next month.

188
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,760
 We came here for
the science fair. Remember?

189
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,680
Yeah.

190
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,520
Come on. Let's take a picture.
Excuse me. Could you hold this?

191
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,360
- Everybody.
- All right.

192
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,840
 Smile.

193
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,760
- There you go.
- Thanks. Thanks a lot.

194
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,920
- "Lorgnette."
- "Lorgnette."

195
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,680
L-O-R-G...

196
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,680
N-E-T...

197
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,920
- T-E?
-  Correct.

198
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,040
- "Dandelion."
- "Dandelion."

199
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,880
D...

200
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,360
A...

201
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,200
N...

202
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,080
D...

203
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,320
E-L-I...

204
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,280
O...

205
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,800
N.

206
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,040
- "Dandelion."
-  Correct.

207
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,680
-  "Daguerreotype."
-  "Daguerreotype."

208
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,640
- 
-  Incorrect.

209
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,680
- "Chiliastic."
- "Chiliastic."

210
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,120
-  "Inchoate."
- "Inchoate."

211
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,200
Correct.

212
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,320

"Suture." "Iridium." "Nomic."

213
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,240
"Staccato." "Pharmacopoeia."

214
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,440
- "Glissando."
- "Glissando."

215
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,280
G - L - l -

216
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,800

"Glissando."

217
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,600
S...

218
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,920
A-N-D-O. "Glissando."

219
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,120
I'm afraid that's incorrect,
but don't leave the stage.

220
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,480
If number 26 misspells her word,
the bee will continue.

221
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,280
If she spells it correctly,
she'll be the winner.

222
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,440
Number 26,your word is "batik."

223
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,520
- "Batik"?
- "Batik."

224
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,160
"Batik."


225
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,280
- 
-  Wow.

226
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,040
Yes!

227
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:25,120
That's my girl! I can't believe it.
Oh, that's great!

228
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,840
I brought you a glass of water.

229
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,440
- Thanks.
- Here you go.

230
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,320
Hmm. Is that my old suitcase?

231
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,760
Dad gave it to me
for the state bee.

232
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,640

I didn't know we still had it.

233
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,280
My parents bought it for me
when I went to boarding school.

234
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,840
Were you scared?

235
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,040
At boarding school?

236
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,960
Um- No. Uh-

237
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,320
I was already about your age.

238
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,840
There was nothing
to be scared of.

239
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,560
- Why'd they send you?
- Hmm.

240
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,720
That's what people did.

241
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,120
Were you there...

242
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,240
when they died?

243
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,800
Uh... yeah. Um, yeah.
I was at school.

244
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,160
Mm-hmm.

245
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,640
This is for you, Elly.

246
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,560
It was mine.
My mother gave it to me.

247
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,120
- What is it?
-

248
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,120
Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no.
Don't- Don't-

249
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,560
It doesn't come apart.
It's a- It's a kaleidoscope.

250
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,240
You look through it
and see things.

251
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,120
Hold it towards the light.

252
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,000
- Hmm?
- Like that, yeah.

253
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,920
- Oh.
- Turn it.

254
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,640
I used to carry it with me.

255
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,640
Mmm. I loved the way
it holds the light.

256
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,160
Do you see that?

257
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,960
Elly?

258
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,440
Um-

259
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,240
When you're trying
to spell a word...

260
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,240
what happens... to you?

261
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,800
I mean, when
you close your eyes?

262
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,280
I start out hearing it
in my head...

263
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,080
in the voice
of whoever said it.

264
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,960
Then the voice changes...
into something else.

265
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,240
The word's voice.

266
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,400
And then I can see it.

267
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,720
- What?
- The word.

268
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
I can see the word.

269
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,080
- Mom?
- Go to sleep.

270
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,240
Mmm.


271
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,400
Good night, Mom.

272
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,640
What you did today
at the bee...

273
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,640
it was, uh...

274
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,560
remarkable.

275
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,600
Good night.

276
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,920
 Were you there...
when they died?

277
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,960

Were you there... when they died?

278
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,280

Were you scared?

279
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,880
I'm tired. I'm tired.

280
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,480
You know, Elly's never
had anything like this.

281
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,720
I used to carry it with me.

282
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,000

Mimi? Mimi?

283
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,280
On y va maintenant,
ma douce.

284
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,840
Hey, sweetheart.

285
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,560
You look like you
could use a snack.

286
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,720
I cut up some cheese or you can have
a cookie if you want, but...

287
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,920
all that sugar,
you'll probably crash later on.

288
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,440
- Protein's better.
- How come you're home?

289
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,000
I came home
to be with you.

290
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,400
Come on in. Come on.

291
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,320
Come on in.

292
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,160
You know, I thought this
could be our study area, right here.

293
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,600
Now, we don't have
as much time as I'd like...

294
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,760
but I think we can get through
a lot before the state bee...

295
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,760
and then, hopefully...

296
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,400
we'll have another chance
for the nationals.

297
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,400
What do you think?

298
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,360
You know, it'd be like
you were one of my students.

299
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,800
I'm pretty good
at this kind of thing, you know.

300
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,720
 That's Mom.

301
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,480
- Hi.
- Hi, honey. Are you okay?

302
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,000
Dad's here. We're in his room.

303
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,120
- Dad?
- He's gonna help me study.

304
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,880
 He wants to talk to you.

305
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,280
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

306
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,200
- Bye.
- Bye.

307
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,120
- Okay. Hey.
- Hi. What's going on?

308
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,640
- I rearranged some office hours
so you don't have to rush home.
- Oh.

309
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,560
- Anything wrong?
- No, I'm-

310
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,360
I'm-I'm fine. I'm just-

311
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,280
- Uh, make sure-
- Mimi.

312
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
- It's okay. We're having a good time.
- Okay.

313
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,880
Okay. Bye.

314
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,200
What happens
to you when you close your eyes?

315
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,120

...when you close your eyes?

316
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,680

Do you see what I see?

317
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,160

What happens to you, Elly...

318
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,120
when you close your eyes?

319
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,520
- Do you see what I see?
- ... what I see?

320
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,800

In the world.

321
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,920
- In the light.
- ... light-

322
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,000

In everything around us.

323
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,040
Here.

324
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,040
Hey!

325
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,840
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

326
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,800
Yeah? I expected you hours ago.
Where you been?

327
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,960
I was starting to worry.
Called your cell. You didn't answer.

328
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,040
- Oh, I forgot to charge it.
- Oh, right.

329
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,480
Uh, Phil asked me to coauthor
the Lancet paper.

330
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,920
I guess he wants someone
to wash his petri dishes.

331
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,920
I thought you
only washed my dishes.

332
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,480
- 
- Hmm?

333
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,880
- There's food here.
- Thanks. I got something.

334
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,800
All right. Aaron?

335
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,960
Aaron!

336
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,880
Not so loud. Elly's studying.

337
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,400
I want you to write
the letters. All right.

338
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,640
I'm gonna start you off here now,
but you gotta keep your eyes closed, okay?

339
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,240
Take a deep breath.

340
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,320
- 
- And just say the letters to yourself.

341
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,520
The whole thing,
backwards and forwards.

342
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,080
- 
- Uh-huh. Relax.

343
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,560
Just-Just concentrate
on the letters.

344
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,840
Good. Good, keep going.

345
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:40,920

V-W-X-Y-Z-Y-X-W-V-U...

346
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,240
T-S-R-Q-P-O-N-M-L-K-

347
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:49,520
Open your mind to the letters, Elly. Concentrate.

348
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,920
Put each one in your mind.
Let them flow through you...

349
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,040
from your hand to the pad.

350
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,360
Okay. You can stop.

351
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,800
That was wonderful,
really wonderful.

352
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,280
I didn't do it.

353
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,440
You know, it's not
what they look like...

354
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,440
it's what they feel like.

355
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,920
You were perfect.

356
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,520
Okay, I'd like us to try something else now,
a little bit different.

357
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,000
 Now, I want you to close
your eyes, take a deep breath.

358
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,360
And now I want you
to open your mind...

359
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,200
to all the words in the universe
that contain the letter E.

360
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,960
E-

361
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,960
E-

362
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,920
- Two, uh, chocolate Kwik shakes.
- Okay.

363
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,880
Really good.

364
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:42,080
-  Oh, great. Is this our champion?
- That's my girl.

365
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,000
- Elly, this is John.
- Hi.

366
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,960
 I brought
you here, Elly, because I want us...

367
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,480
to start thinking about
something beyondjust spelling...

368
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,200
beyond letters and words.

369
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,720
You know that
to become a professor...

370
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,240
I had to write a thesis,
kind of a book.

371
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,800
I wrote about
something very special.

372
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,680
About kabbalah-
Jewish mysticism.

373
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,560
And one of the most famous
of theJewish mystics...

374
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,040
was a man called
Abraham Abulafia.

375
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,280
What's a mystic?

376
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,240
A mystic is a person...

377
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,520
who believes that you can talk...

378
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,520
really connect with God.

379
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,680
Not just pray,
but have God listen...

380
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:32,040
and sometimes, in special cases,
have God talk back.

381
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,760
Aaron sings to God.
I've heard him.

382
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,240
Yeah, well, we all can do things
in praise of God-

383
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,400
write poetry, simply pray.

384
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,080
But I'm talking about
something more...

385
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,000
something that
almost no one can do...

386
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,560
something beyond words.

387
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,640
What?

388
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,760
Let God flow through you.

389
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:03,320
Abulafia believed that
by concentrating on letters...

390
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,560
the mind could be opened up...

391
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,800
and reach what
he called shefa.

392
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,000
What?

393
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,040
The most special way
of being together with God.

394
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:22,120
Steps to getting there
are in these books.

395
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,200
Exercises, words and letters.

396
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,040
-  Like what we've been doing.
- Yes, exactly. Let me show you.

397
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,320

Elly?

398
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,480
Mmm?

399
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,320
Elly?

400
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,600
Elly. Bad dream?

401
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,920
I have a present for you.

402
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,560
It was mine
when I was your age.

403
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,360
But we'll pick something up
before you leave tomorrow, if it doesn't fit.

404
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,960
Get dressed for
school now, okay?

405
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,640
Thanks, Mom.

406
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,080
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey. What's up?

407
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,000
- Uh, nothing.
- I'm late. Uh-

408
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,400
- I was returning your Brodsky.
- Oh, God. I forgot about that.

409
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,440
Yeah, could you put it on top
of my desk? I got to go. See you.

410
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,440
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

411
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,880

Have mercy on us all.

412
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,880
Make us worthy to share
eternal life with Mary-

413
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,800
- Oh, sorry.
-  Excuse me.

414
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,120
...the apostles
and with all the saints...

415
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,720
who have done your will
throughout the ages.

416
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,640
May we praise you
in union with them...

417
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,920
and give you glory through
your son, Jesus Christ.

418
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,640
This is the Lamb of God who takes away
the sins of the world.

419
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,600
And happy are those who have
been called to his supper.

420
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,040

The body of Christ.

421
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,040
Dad? Is God red?

422
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,680
Red?


423
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,600
No.

424
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,960
 The support about
which a lever pivots. "fulcrum."

425
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:45,000

I've almost got it.

426
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,240
F-U-L-C-R-U-M.

427
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,520
Well done, Elly Belly.
Okay. "Puerile."

428
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,320
Maybe that's enough
spelling for now.

429
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,280
Okay. Earth to Aaron.
Come in, Aaron.

430
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,640
- What?
- So how about it? What do you think?

431
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,560
- How about what?
- I asked you 10 minutes ago.

432
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,920
You think you and Mom will survive
a few days while we're at the state finals?

433
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,440
Yeah.


434
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,360
Sure. Whatever.

435
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,000
Aaron? You didn't eat anything.

436
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,720
Thought he liked my cooking.

437
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,520
Okay, 713. This way.

438
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,240
It's on this side.

439
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,360

Here it is.

440
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,640

- Wow, look at this.

441
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,560
Adjoining rooms, pretty cool.

442
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,120
Why don't you pick one, honey?

443
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,960
- Which one do you want?
- This one, I think.

444
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,280
Take the other one.
It's got a better view.

445
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,360
You'll like it better.

446
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,280
You wanna practice a little?

447
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,200
- Mm-hmm.
- Good.

448
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,960
Tiger?

449
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,960
- Tiger.
- Oh.

450
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,960
Come here. Come on.
Sorry about her.

451
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,960
- 
- Don't worry about it.

452
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,480
- So, are you?
- What?

453
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,440
A Hindu.

454
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:46,280
- Oh, no. No.
- Too many gods?

455
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,040
Yeah, something like that.

456
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,920
- I'm Chali.
- Aaron.

457
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,840
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

458
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:59,120
- School stuff?
- Uh, no. Just checking it out.

459
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,600
Something's missing.

460
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:07,720
- How do you mean?
- From your life.

461
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:11,360

Yeah, I guess.

462
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,320
I used to feel that way.

463
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,200
I was raised a Catholic,
but it felt like empty ritual.

464
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,600
Yeah, my mom was Catholic...

465
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,840
and she, uh, converted
when she met my dad.

466
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,160
We'reJewish.

467
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,480
- Can I give you something to read?
- Yeah, sure.

468
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,280
My number's on the back.

469
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,400
- Oh, awesome.
-

470
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,160
- It was nice to meet you, Aaron.
- Yeah, you too.

471
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,080
Girl. Come on, you.

472
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,840
- Bye, Cali.
-  Chali.

473
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,760
Chali.

474
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,400
That is correct. Except that you've omitted
the last and most important word.

475
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,080
9:30.

476
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,960
Uh-Y-You're not
riding with me?

477
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,920
No, I've got some stuff
to do after school.

478
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
- You-You sure?
- Yeah.

479
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,920
Hi, you've reached Saul Naumann.
Leave me a message and I'll get back to you.

480
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,640
- "Selenic."
- "Selenic."

481
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,560
S...

482
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,600
E-L-

483
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,280
- 
- L-E-N...

484
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,000
l-C.

485
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,920
"Selenic."

486
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,280

-  That's incorrect.

487
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,480

"Cumulus."

488
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,360
"Cumulus."

489
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,840

Hurry up.

490
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,280
Hi. Um, I'm here
to see Chali.

491
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,440

Here, is it here?

492
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,800
Is it the light here?
The air?

493
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:02,680
The noise? The dirt?

494
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,720
Everything?

495
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:09,560
Everything here? Everything.

496
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,760
God has left us hope.
God has left us- God has left us hope.

497
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,320
...E- E-N. "Duvetyn"?

498
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,440
- 
-  That's incorrect.

499
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,240
"Cotyledon."

500
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:58,000
"Cotyledon"?

501
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,520

That is correct. "Cotyledon."

502
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,600
May I have
a definition, please?

503
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:07,720
A cotyledon is the primary
or embryonic leaf...

504
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,680
or leaves of a seedling.

505
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,240
What is the derivation,
please?

506
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:15,640
"Cotyledon"comes to us
from the Greek.

507
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,680
C-O...

508
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,240
T...

509
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,840
- Y.
- Y-L-

510
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,280
- E.
- E-D-

511
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,200
- O.
- O-

512
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:50,000
- N.
- N. "Cotyledon."

513
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,800

Correct.

514
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,800
Hey. You're late.

515
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,640
- Mom knew.
- Well, she's late too.

516
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,440
Guess what? Your little sister won.
She's going to the nationals.

517
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,720
- Yeah?
- Washington, D.C.

518
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,760
I'm cooking a victory dinner.

519
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,560
Evening, champ. What'll it be?
Broccoli or beans?

520
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,040
I know, I know, but you
gotta eat something green.

521
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:31,560
- Do you want a- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

522
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,280
- So what happened while we were gone?
- Nothing.

523
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,280
Nothing? Something's gotta
happen in three days.

524
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,200
- Not really.
- No?

525
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,960
- You know, I left a sonata
on your bed before I left.
- Yeah, I found it.

526
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,880
Want to give it a try
tomorrow, maybe?

527
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,160
Um, I'm going out for pizza
and a movie tomorrow.

528
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,960
There wouldn't be a girl involved in
this pizza-movie venture, would there?

529
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:54,600
- No, there wouldn't.
- You don't have to be embarrassed about a date.

530
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,840
- It's not a date. So-
- Okay.

531
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,800
Uh, I've got homework.

532
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,040
- Dinner in an hour.
- Yeah.

533
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,640
Fine.

534
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:16,760
- Mim, is that you?
- Yeah, i-it's me.

535
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,360
- Mom?
- Yes?

536
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,160
I think the blouse is lucky.

537
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,280
- I'm gonna wear it at the nationals.
- Elly, you startled me.

538
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,760
- I didn't know you were still up.
- I was watching TV.

539
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,320
Let's put you to bed.

540
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,520
I love you, Mom.

541
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,040
Me too.

542
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,720
G-Go to sleep now.

543
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,040
I love you, Elly.

544
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,920

We're not alone.

545
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:35,600
Any of us, we can
make connections.

546
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:40,200
- Tikkun olam.
- Yes, we can fix what's been broken.

547
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,240
We can make things
whole again.

548
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,120
Gathering shards.

549
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,120
- Yes. Together.
-

550
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Hold me. Please, hold me.

551
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,560
- Hey. Hey!
-

552
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,080
H-Honey.

553
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,840
Oh, honey.

554
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,240
Oh, honey. Oh, God.

555
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,240

How about this one?

556
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:22,560
- Okay, thanks.
- Sure I can't tempt you, Aaron? It's really good.

557
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,280
That's my ride.

558
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,960
 We only need three.


559
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,760
- That's perfect. Thanks.
- Okay.

560
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,240
- I'd like to meet your friend.
- Maybe next time.

561
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,160
There's a girl at the gate.

562
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,480
Hi.

563
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,920
- Hey, uh, hi. Hi.
-  Hey.

564
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,720
-  Hi.
- Hello.

565
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,120
Aaron, introduce
your guest here.

566
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,680
- Hi, I'm Aaron's dad.
- This is Chali.

567
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,040
- Chali.
- Chali?

568
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,520
- Yeah, Chali.
- Chali. Okay.

569
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,720
- I'm Miriam. Nice to meet you.
-  Hi. Nice to meet you.

570
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,680
- You want some, uh,
chicken before you go?

571
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,000
- Oh-
- I'm famous for the sauce.

572
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:02,360
- She doesn't want any.
- No? Let her answer for herself.

573
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,320

Actually, I don't eat chicken.

574
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,440
- Why not?
- 'Cause I'm a vegetarian.

575
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,600
Oh, interesting.
I was a vegetarian once.

576
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:12,280
- Okay, let's go. Come on.
- Okay. It was nice to meet you all.

577
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,400
- Okay.
- Bye.

578
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,680
- Nice meeting you.
-  Have fun. Come again.

579
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,760
I grill a mean tofu.

580
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,720

Bye. See you later.

581
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,680
Okay, my translation.

582
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,120
This notebook is my translation
of Abulafia's words.

583
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,520
It's his guide, Elly,
for reaching shefa.

584
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,880
"Cleanse your heart and soul.

585
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,800
"Permute the letters
back and forth.

586
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:51,320
"This will arouse in you many words,
one after the other.

587
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,800
"You will feel then as if
an additional spirit is within you.

588
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:58,680
"You will experience
ecstasy and trembling.

589
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,040
"In this manner,
you will reach beyond yourself.

590
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,560
"Go slowly,
as the path is dangerous...

591
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,520
and must be traveled
with caution."

592
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,160
- I'd like us to try this.
- What?

593
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,040
A permutation.

594
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,120
Other people...

595
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,360
have tried to do these,
but almost no one has felt...

596
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,720
that special feeling
that he wrote about.

597
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,440
I haven't been able
to do it. I tried.

598
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,800
It was very important
to me, but... I couldn't.

599
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,600
But I think maybe you can.

600
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,320
I think you have
what Abulafia had.

601
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,280
I saw it on the stage
at the bee.

602
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:39,680
I think you can use
his methods to achieve shefa...

603
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,840
to reach the ear of God.

604
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,520
Let me show you
what I mean.

605
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,440
Let's permute
the word "Earth."

606
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,600
What's inside
this word? "Earth."

607
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,520
"Heart." "Rathe."

608
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,560
- Like in Boggle.
- Yeah, like that.

609
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,360
Except the combinations don't
have to mean anything in the usual sense.

610
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,760
Try another one.
You do it. Uh, "library."

611
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,960

Make yourself right.

612
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:15,720
Cleanse your heart and soul.
Permute the letters back and forth.

613
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,000

Permute the letters back and forth.

614
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,960
- You will feel then-
- You will feel then-

615
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:23,200
...as if an additional spirit-
...as if an additional spirit is within you.

616
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:26,280
- In this manner you will-
- In this manner you will reach beyond yourself.

617
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:29,600
Go slowly,
as the path is dangerous...

618
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:33,480
and must be traveled
with caution.

619
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,600
Krishna, Krishna, Hare, Hare...

620
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:37,680
Hare Rama,
Rama, Rama, Hare, Hare...

621
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,360
Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna,
Krishna, Krishna, Hare, Hare...

622
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,040
- Hare Rama, Rama Hare

623
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,480
Yeah?

624
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,280
- It's me.
- Hey.

625
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,480
- She was nice.
- Thanks.

626
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:06,680

It smells nice in here.

627
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,360
I'm sorry I'm late.

628
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,200
Where were you?

629
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:13,040
- Miriam?
- I'm just tired, and I want to go to sleep.

630
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,960

Will there be supervision?

631
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:55,400
Mm-hmm. I took
the blue sleeping bag.

632
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,240
All right.

633
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:05,080
- Hi. Uh, Aaron's going camping.
- Just for the weekend.

634
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,040
Mom said it was okay.

635
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,400

Alone?

636
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,640
Uh, no.
With the Sierra Club.

637
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,600
- Bye.
- Bye. Thanks a lot.

638
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:18,160

Bye.

639
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:22,680
I like camping.

640
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,800
Hare, Hare, Hare Krishna

641
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,200
 Elly, I want you to take
one simple, easy breath...

642
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,600
and draw the sound out
from very deep inside of you-

643
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:52,080
- "Krishna, Krishna"
- till you can taste it completely.

644
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:57,560
And when you're ready,
just let your body move.

645
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:17,040
"Hare Krishna
Hare Krishna"

646
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:08,600
What's wrong?

647
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,320
Why do you
look like that?

648
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:15,320
 Dad?

649
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,280
You moved the way
Abulafia described it.

650
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,200
I want to do more.

651
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:23,240
Remember what I told you?

652
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,160
We're gonna take
our time with this.

653
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,840
- Okay.
- If we go too fast, this could be dangerous.

654
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:32,920
What we're doing here
is a very special kind of knowledge.

655
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,720
- The words in this notebook are very powerful.
- 'Kay.

656
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,480
We'll see how it goes
after the nationals.

657
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:45,240
It- It feels so light.

658
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,960
Yeah. Yeah, light.

659
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,880
All right.
Just one more time.

660
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:13,720
"Adonai"

661
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:17,080
Hare Rama, Hare Rama,
Rama, Rama, Hare, Hare...

662
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:19,960
Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna,
Krishna, Krishna, Hare, Hare-

663
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,400
- Hello.
- Hello.

664
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:26,920
I'm really happy here, Chali.

665
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:52,080
-  Oh. Oh.
- It's okay.

666
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:55,200
Oh, dear.
Why didn't you wake me?

667
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:58,000
- I just found you here.
-

668
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,320
You're bleeding.

669
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,240
- What is this?
- Uh-

670
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:06,200
Oh, I must have bumped-
bumped my head on the table.

671
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,160
- How'd you do that?
- I don't know.

672
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,960
Hey, what's going on, Mim?

673
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:24,440
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

674
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:27,320
Is there something
you want to tell me?

675
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,840
What?

676
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:33,880
Because I don't know what you're doing.
I don't know where you've been.

677
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:36,000
I don't know where you went.
I don't know anything.

678
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,720
I'm sorry.

679
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,920
What's the matter with Mom?

680
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:54,240
Oh, she just fell
asleep here, honey.

681
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,320
In the kitchen?

682
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,320
Yeah, she's okay.
She's- She's okay.

683
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,040
Your brother's
coming home tonight.

684
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:07,240
We're gonna-We're gonna have
a nice family dinner.

685
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:32,760
- Hey.
- Hey. Back from the wilderness.

686
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,520
- All in one piece.
- Yeah.

687
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:39,000
See the article on Elly
today in the paper?

688
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:42,080
- No.
- About her going to the national bee.

689
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:45,920
So how 'bout you?
Sacrifice any virgins out there?

690
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,240
Hey.

691
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:07,520
She's been gone all day.
She didn't take the car.

692
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:13,560
And in the morning...
her head was bleeding.

693
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:18,600
You saw that?
Her head was bleeding?

694
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:27,560
Elly... if-if I tell you something...

695
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,520
will you promise
to keep it to yourself?

696
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,120
I didn't go camping.

697
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,280
Where'd you go?

698
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:43,160
To a place for...

699
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,240
people who want
to get closer to God.

700
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,240
Dad wants to get
closer to God.

701
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:54,360
Yeah, well.

702
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:59,440
Do you like it better...
there?

703
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:17,840
 Hello?
Yes, this is Mr. Naumann.

704
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,760
Yes, Saul Naumann.

705
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:24,040
Look.

706
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,680
Your mother's been-

707
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:29,600
I'll call you as soon
as I know everything, okay?

708
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,400
Is it because of my spelling?

709
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,000
It has nothing to do with you.

710
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,000
Go to sleep.

711
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,400
What is this?

712
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:29,200
It's the address your wife gave as her
place of residence. She had the key in her pocket.

713
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:46,880
Manager said she's had
the space for years.

714
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,880
We're looking into how much
of this stuff is stolen.

715
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:19,800
- Mind if I smoke?
- No.

716
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,480

She's in the hospital.

717
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:03,840
She was exhausted.

718
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,200
Sick and confused.

719
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:09,120
Can I see her?

720
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:13,000
I don't know. Some hospitals
have rules about children.

721
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:15,720
- But I'll see later when I get there.
- Will she get better?

722
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,640
Yeah, yeah.
Of course she will. Yes.

723
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,880
Aren't you riding
with us?

724
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:31,120
I've got some stuff
to do before school.

725
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:33,040
You didn't eat anything yet.

726
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:42,280
Good-bye.

727
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:55,520
- Bye, EI.
- Bye.

728
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:59,520
- Maybe we'll try some takeout tonight.
- Yeah, maybe.

729
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:20,800
Did you see it?

730
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:28,160

Yes.

731
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:30,640
It's beautiful, isn't it?

732
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,320
I've never
seen anything like it.

733
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:40,480
It's beginning
to hold the light.

734
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:46,880
- I'm sorry. I don't understand.
- The shards, putting them together.

735
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,400
Tikkun olam-
to make things whole.

736
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:54,600
Hold the light.
You showed me.

737
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:00,040
Miriam, it-
It was a metaphor.

738
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:02,040
A-A poem.

739
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:06,160
Yes, a poem.
I made a poem.

740
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,280
The police think that you took
all those things.

741
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:22,600
- Some of them are mine- ours.
- And some aren't.

742
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,560
I needed more.

743
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:29,040
They said they found you
in another family's house.

744
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,960
I need you to come home, honey.
Kids need you to come home.

745
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:38,200
I don't want
to come home right now.

746
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,200
They're not going
to prosecute.

747
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:43,520
They just want to make sure that you
get some help. All you got to do...

748
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:46,440
is you say you're sorry that you took
the things that didn't belong to you.

749
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:48,960
I'm not sorry.
It wasn't stealing.

750
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:52,200
- Miriam, please, just-
- I thought maybe you'd understand.

751
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:56,000
- I do understand. I do.
But I need you to come home.
- Stop it. You don't understand.

752
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:00,840
I can't go home
with you now, Saul.

753
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:06,080
Look at me.

754
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:10,600
What do you see?

755
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:19,680
You-You love to talk-

756
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:24,360
talk about things that don't-
that don't come from your heart.

757
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:27,360
You talk and talk
and talk and talk.

758
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:35,360
Are they all empty words?

759
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,440
Do you want to understand?

760
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,880
Understand me?

761
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,880

This?

762
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,960
That room, those things-

763
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,840
It wasn't-

764
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:00,200
Miriam, please.
Please, talk to me.

765
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:02,160
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

766
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:04,800
I-I want to go back
to my room now, please.

767
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,840
Tell me what's wrong, please.

768
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:09,920
I just wanted to hold
the light, that's all.

769
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:12,360
I didn't do this
to hurt you.

770
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:23,760
She took some things
she thought were hers, but they weren't.

771
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,880
The doctors are
working with her now.

772
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:29,120

She said she didn't want to see me?

773
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:32,560
Elly, she's-She's really not ready
to see anybody right now.

774
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:35,520
She took all that stuff
and now we can't go to the finals.

775
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:41,320
What are you talking about?
Who told you we're not going?

776
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:45,040
It's my fault, isn't it?
That's why she's sick.

777
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:50,480
No. That's-
That's not why she's-

778
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:53,280
It is nobody's fault,
all right?

779
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:01,120
We'll go to the finals,
and your mother will watch.

780
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,880
It's on TV. We'll tell her
about it, okay?

781
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,880
All right. Okay?

782
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:12,640
I'm sorry, baby.

783
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:16,200
Yeah? Aaron, where are you?

784
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:21,800
No, uh- No, they're
keeping her in the hospital.

785
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,920
I'll explain when-
when you get home.

786
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:27,440
Of course you will
be coming home. Where are you?

787
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:31,760
Aaron? Where-

788
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:35,440
I can't deal with this now.

789
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:40,280
 Shit!

790
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:50,280
Where am I calling?
The what?

791
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:52,880
All right.
Stay in the car.

792
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,440
I've come for my son.

793
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,760
- Yes?
- If you don't give him to me, I will call the police.

794
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,280
- Come in.
- Right.

795
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:27,400
Oh, Aaron.

796
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:30,160
All right, get dressed.
We're going home.

797
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:33,400
- I am dressed.
- Then let's go.

798
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:47,000
- You can't keep me from coming back.
- Oh, really? Watch me.

799
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:49,160
- I really can't believe you did this.
- Get in the car.

800
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:56,240

Don't talk to me.

801
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:58,640
 Get back here.
You're acting like a child.

802
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:00,560
- Eliza has more sense.
- Of course you think that.

803
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:04,120
- She agrees with everything you
say. Talk about brainwashed.
- I'm not finished.

804
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:06,440
- Don't walk away!
- You're going to stop me
from going to my room now?

805
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,840
- I want you to come here-
- You do not get to tell me what to do-

806
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,400
- control what I feel or think.
- Stop it.

807
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:12,360
- I'm not Eliza. I'm not Mom.
- Goddamn it!

808
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:15,240
- You do not talk to me like that!
- You don't fucking control me!

809
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:20,440
She's not even in the hospital, is she?
She just got tired of being here.

810
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:24,680
Tired of you and your house
and your cooking and your religion...

811
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:28,240
and your everything,
and you just can't face the truth.

812
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:33,640
You want to know
the truth, Aaron?

813
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:38,840
Your mother has been stealing things
for years. Maybe her whole life.

814
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,840
She's very sick.
She's in a mental institution...

815
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:45,000
and I don't know when or if
they will give her back to me.

816
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,160
You're the one who's sick.

817
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,240
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

818
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:51,720
 Who's the one
who's walking around in a sheet?

819
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,640
- In orange bedsheets.
- Stop it.

820
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:56,720
- Aaron, you are a baby. You're a kid.
- Stop it! Stop it!

821
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:59,440
You want to go to- Go to your room.
Go to your fucking room!

822
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:01,560
- Go.
- Why can't you live your own stupid life?

823
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:03,880
Why do you have to drag me
and Elly into it?

824
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:05,880
Why can't you leave us alone?

825
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,120

Aaron.

826
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:16,040
Aaron?

827
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:22,240
Please, God.
Please, please, please-

828
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:42,480

We can talk-

829
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,960
really connect with God.

830
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:47,360
Notjust pray...

831
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,600
but have God listen.

832
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:58,520
And sometimes
in special cases...

833
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,240
have God talk back.

834
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:21,960
Got it?
Okay, this way.

Dad?

846
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:11,280
Hey. Hey, you were incredible
up there today.

847
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,200
Thanks.

just to keep loose?

You can do this.

861
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:16,840
Yes, you can.

862
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:21,800

He should leave you alone.

863
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:26,360
- It's okay.
- He just wants this for himself.

864
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,880
You know, he's using you,
like he used Mom...

865
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,640
and like he used me.

866
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:33,960
I just think you should
forget about him.

867
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:36,840
That's all I mean.

868
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:41,480
He needs this-all the attention
and the control-

869
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,320
and he doesn't even know it.

870
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,760
He needs Mom.

871
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:37,480
What are you doing down here
this time of night?

872
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:40,560
I want to see
the television cameras.

873
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:43,160
You in that spelling
contest tomorrow?

874
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:56,240
- I don't see them.
- The cameras?

875
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:59,480
 I guess they don't
bring them till the morning.

876
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:07,240
You better get back to sleep before your
mother comes down here looking for you.

877
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:10,440
She won't.
I need to win first.

878
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:14,080
Don't be silly. Nobody's mother
needs her to win anything.

879
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:35,160
 Go slowly.
The path is dangerous-

880
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,120

The path is dangerous.

881
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:39,640
- And must be traveled with caution.
- With caution.

882
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,840
The words in this notebook
are very, very powerful.

883
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:00,520

Permute the letters back and forth.

884
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:03,240

Permute the letters back and forth.

885
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:13,040
This will arouse in you
many words, one after the other.

886
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:18,840
The light.

887
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:21,960
 You will feel then
as if an additional spirit is within you.

888
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:26,040
Light, light, light, light.

889
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:29,920

Let God flow through you.

893
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:46,320
I want to reach the ear of God.

894
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:01,040
- To reach the ear of God-
- I want to talk to God.

895
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:13,920
The sounds.

896
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:21,400
The letters.

897
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:27,720
The letters.
The sound.

898
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:16,000

Elly? Hey, Elly.

899
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:20,560
You okay?
What happened?

900
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:25,520
It's 7.30.
We've got to get you cleaned up.

901
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:28,000
Come on. Let's get you ready for the

902
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:33,800
Everybody up?
I got orangejuice, croissants.

903
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:38,640
This is it, kiddo.
This is the one.

904
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:40,560
Come on. Let me help you.

905
01:27:57,720 --> 01:28:02,200
These are the final rounds, and
they're on national television.

Ladies and gentlemen...

the new national spelling bee champion
from Denver, Colorado.

986
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:54,040
My father told me once
that I could reach the ear of God-

987
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:58,400
that words and letters would guide me
to reach beyond myself...

988
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:02,080
to know the world
as whole again.

989
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:07,400
And like the ancient mystics,
God will flow through me.

990
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:21,000
And we would be together.

991
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:26,080
She's my daughter.
