1
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:05,148
Good. Ahem.

2
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,366
Come on, sweetie, smile.

3
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:17,577
Don't be shy, eh?

4
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:20,246
These internet pictures are important.

5
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,457
20 beautiful girls on one web page.

6
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,126
Why do they pick you?

7
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,005
You need a drink?

8
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,132
Drink? No.

9
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,968
Ah, help you relax.

10
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,970
I don't need drink for relax.

11
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:40,308
Get undressed.

12
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,105
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

13
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,524
So turn around. Turn around.

14
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,193
Smile.

15
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,622
Don't move, don't move.
Yes, great.

16
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,752
Yeah, yeah.

17
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,803
Stop, stop.

18
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,348
That's good.

19
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,231
Head up, head up.

20
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:46,040
So, uh, how much--

21
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,124
Anna.

22
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,212
"How much money will I get?"

23
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,339
How much money will I get?

24
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,675
It depends. it depends.

25
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,885
I had one girl--Come on.

26
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,303
Okay.

27
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,889
I had one girl--Blanka--

28
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:04,141
was rich after one day.

29
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:05,393
Wow.

30
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,104
You have something to change?

31
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:12,733
She was smart, you know?

32
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:17,071
Her first client was a sheik, an Arab, ja?

33
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:20,783
She saw a big aktentasche,
full of dollars.

34
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,785
Sends me an S.M.S.,

35
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,746
uh, "Come quick."
and I come quick to the hotel room.

36
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:29,750
"Hello, room service."
Pow.

37
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:32,753
And afterwards we split it,
50/50, you understand?

38
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,338
Yes.

39
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,966
That's good. Smile, smile,
smile, smile, smile.

40
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:43,931
Okay, sit here.

41
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,725
So...

42
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:48,769
So do you choose a name already?

43
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,104
Yes.

44
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,190
Blanka.

45
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,862
We are done, Blanka.

46
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:09,373
So when will the pictures
be on internet?

47
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,250
When you want, schatzi?

48
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,044
Tonight.

49
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:14,837
Tonight?

50
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,923
No, schatzi, no.

51
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:20,509
There are so many other girls waiting.

52
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,553
Unless...

53
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:25,348
you do something for me.

54
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,893
Joke, eh?

55
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:53,167
She's cute.
She can work for me, too.

56
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,419
My sister? Never.

57
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,588
Why? She's too good for this?

58
00:04:57,673 --> 00:05:00,466
Yes. She has heart.

59
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,762
- I have a heart.
- No, you don't.

60
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:29,662
<i>This blinding kiss<i>

61
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:33,666
<i>Breathes helium<i>

62
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,877
<i>Into my heart<i>

63
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,631
<i>And erases<i>

64
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,675
<i>The embraces<i>

65
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,595
<i>Of all other lovers<i>

66
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:53,310
<i>With this kiss<i>

67
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:01,027
<i>Your ruby lips<i>

68
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,573
<i>Speak for themselves<i>

69
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:09,035
<i>They tell nothing but lies<i>

70
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,832
<i>I dissolve into the wax<i>

71
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,169
<i>Of a flickering candle<i>

72
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,551
<i>In this kiss...<i>

73
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,398
Hello?

74
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,359
Good news.

75
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:45,905
- Tomorrow, 7 PM, Hotel Steigenberger.
- Rocco.

76
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:49,366
Top manager,
in town for auto show.

77
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,035
Huh?

78
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,287
Are you going to say thank you?

79
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,081
- Thank you.
- You see?

80
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,916
You're good to me,
I'm good to you.

81
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:01,921
Tomorrow, 7:00,
Hotel Steigenberger.

82
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:05,091
Yeah? And don't be late, eh?

83
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:08,010
- Okay.
- And look elegant, nice, yeah?

84
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,513
Understand?
He's a top manager.

85
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,348
- Okay?
- Top manager.

86
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,253
<i>Ciao.</i>

87
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,384
- "What is your job?"
- What is your job?

88
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,389
"You are a nice man."

89
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,974
You are a nice man.

90
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,440
"Today" --

91
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:08,154
"Today I went to a fitness center
with my girlfriend."

92
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,364
Today I went
to a fitness center with--

93
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,726
Hello.

94
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,438
Okay, schatzi,
he's waiting at the bar.

95
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,441
His name is Michael Daly.

96
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,443
They are booking us for two hours.

97
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,112
Listen--very important:
You don't take the money

98
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:35,658
in public place.
You take the money at the room.

99
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,576
As soon as you have the money,
you give me a call

100
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,703
to say everything's okay. Okay?

101
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,790
So good luck, schatzi, hmm?

102
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,876
I think he's even more nervous than you.

103
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,637
Hey, Michael.

104
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,599
There you are.
I've been looking for you.

105
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,436
Listen, we've come to tell you
that we have reconsidered

106
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,938
and we agree to your price
at 400 per unit.

107
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:49,565
Really?

108
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,525
Yeah, plus delivery within 90 days.

109
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,779
- So what do you say?
- That's very interesting.

110
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,698
I'm sorry.
You catch me at a bad moment.

111
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,908
All I can tell you is that you won't
find anyone in Europe

112
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,744
- who can match that offer.
- As it happens,

113
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,371
I got an offer yesterday
from the Estonian suppliers

114
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,790
Who beat that both your delivery
dates and price.

115
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,293
Estonia? Okay.

116
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,295
Well, you know, go ahead,
do your business in the Baltics.

117
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,298
See how you like it.
We've done it, once.

118
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,133
Never again.
Worse than the Russians.

119
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,427
My responsibility is cutting the costs.

120
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,721
And their figures are very good.

121
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,431
Speaking of good figures,

122
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,559
I see they started letting in
hookers here again.

123
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,103
How do you know she's a hooker?

124
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,605
Come on, it's obvious.
Look at her--the hair, the dress.

125
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,190
Excuse me.

126
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,907
Daddy can't speak right now.

127
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,408
Can I get a dog, please?

128
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,786
A dog? You want a dog?

129
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:47,081
You know Louise in my class?
She got one for her birthday.

130
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,917
Mm, I'd rather talk about it tomorrow
when I get home.

131
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,461
- I'm not very keen, Ellie.
- Why not?

132
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:56,131
Because I will be the one taking it
for a walk every night.

133
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:59,385
- Please, please?!
- We--

134
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,388
Don't get upset.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

135
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,140
Yes, I'm coming back.
I'll see you in the play.

136
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,393
All right, night, night.

137
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,436
- Love you.
- I love you too.

138
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,448
- "Blanka."
- Sorry about that.

139
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,409
That's her.
Her name is Blanka.

140
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:27,788
What interests me is whether
she's here looking for business

141
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:31,208
or waiting for a customer that she
has already arranged to meet,

142
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,085
in which case I suggest we sit here

143
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,878
and wait for the dirty bugger
to show up

144
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,047
and then take pictures of him
to blackmail him with.

145
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:43,053
Sadly there's no reviews yet or else
I could tell you how good she was--

146
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:44,638
- Reviews?
- Yeah, reviews.

147
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,473
Guys who have seen girls,
they write reviews

148
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:47,891
and then post them on the site.

149
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:51,520
I can't believe you want to share that
with me in a business meeting.

150
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,105
Why? it's not a crime.

151
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,899
It's hardly something
to be proud of either.

152
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,527
I'm sorry. I didn't know that I was dealing
with the Moral Majority here.

153
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,529
Just someone
with a little self-respect.

154
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,322
Good luck with the rest of the fair.

155
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,463

00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:51,413
<i>Mmm<i>

166
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:54,333
- <i>The song...<i>
- Hello, love, it's me.

167
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,921
I'm sitting in a restaurant...

168
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,050
alone, wishing you were here.

169
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:06,970
<i>A small song<i>

170
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,681
<i>Mmm<i>

171
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:13,936
<i>I sang it all night long<i>

172
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:18,065
<i>And when the morning came<i>

173
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:22,694
<i>I had to start<i>

174
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:27,449
<i>All over again<i>

175
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,035
<i>My song is so<i>

176
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,747
<i>So small<i>

177
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,458
<i>Mmm<i>

178
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,921
<i>If I was right, I would be wrong<i>

179
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,257
<i>Don't be afraid<i>

180
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:46,927
<i>It's just a sma-a-a...<i>

181
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,972
<i>A-a-a-a...<i>

182
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,807
<i>A-a-all song<i>

183
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,934
<i>Mmm mmm mmm<i>

184
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,936
Hello, sweetheart. Me again.

185
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,565
Um, look, I'm just calling
to say good night.

186
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,984
Uh, if you get this
in the next 10 minutes,

187
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,987
call me back in my room
because my phone will be charging.

188
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,530
Um, if not,

189
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,700
sweet dreams.

190
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:11,702
We'll speak tomorrow.

191
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,495
I love you

192
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,540
more than ever.
I wanted you to know that.

193
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,432
Hi, baby.
Were you in the bath?

194
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,934
As a matter of fact
I was, yes.

195
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,437
- Sorry?
- Oh, Michael.

196
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:42,149
Reflecting on what a beautiful
evening I just had.

197
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,151
How was yours?

198
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,778
Fine, thank you.
It's a bit late for this, isn't it?

199
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,780
Of course, I'm sorry.
I won't keep you long.

200
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,782
It's just a--
just a quick word.

201
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:54,536
Literally, it's one single word.

202
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,038
Blanka.

203
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,875
Got your attention now, haven't I?

204
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:02,002
I don't know what you're talking about.

205
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,046
Oh, I think you do, Michael.

206
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:08,967
Because after you left, I went over
to chat to our little Slovakian friend.

207
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:13,388
And after it turned out that her 7:00
appointment was a no-show,

208
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,600
I did the only decent thing
that a gentleman could do

209
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,436
in these circumstances
and I booked her.

210
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,105
Now after the main event,

211
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,441
which was excellent, by the way--

212
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,569
Olympic, five-star review on its way--

213
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:32,199
I asked her what she had been doing
at the bar of the hotel.

214
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,201
Is this where she would
always drum up business,

215
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,411
or had she been stood up?

216
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:39,539
And she told me
that she had gone there

217
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:43,001
to meet someone
from the automobile show.

218
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,711
"Really?" I said. "Who?"

219
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,922
'Cause I know
a lot of the guys, right?

220
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,091
Now thinking that
she would say something like,

221
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,968
"Mr. Presley" or "Mr. Pacino,"

222
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:55,013
'cause they'd never be stupid enough
to give their actual name,

223
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:56,598
do you know what she said?

224
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,894
"Daly."

225
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,188
"Michael Daly."

226
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:08,068
So, Mr. Michael Daly,

227
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:11,947
esteemed company director
with a little self-respect

228
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,116
and wedding ring on finger,

229
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,285
how about we have breakfast
tomorrow morning,

230
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,497
you and me, and we renegotiate
whatever it is

231
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:24,292
you agreed with those
Estonian gypsies?

232
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,003
Let's say 7:30 in the restaurant?

233
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,500
- Hi, Siobhan.
- Hello again.

234
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,526
Coming.

235
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,285
- Hi.
- You're half an hour late.

236
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,204
I know.

237
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,623
- Hi.
- I missed you.

238
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,625
- Rui?
- Hmm?

239
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,961
- I want to talk to you.
- Yeah?

240
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,255
- Can we talk?
- Can I kiss you?

241
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:28,258
Can we talk first, please?
I need to talk to you.

242
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:30,510
Why? What's wrong?

243
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:37,142
We--Will you stop? We can't--
We have to stop this.

244
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:39,435
You're kidding, right?

245
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,437
No. Can you put some clothes on, please?

246
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:44,149
- Put your clothes on.
- Okay.

247
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:46,693
Yeah, okay, I'm decent now.

248
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:48,236
- Rui!
- Let's--Let's talk.

249
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,822
What? it's not the first time you see it, is it?

250
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,703
Please help me out here a little bit.

251
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:59,330
You are so beautiful. I missed you.

252
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,751
Rui.

253
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,424
What's wrong?
Do I make too many demands on you?

254
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,135
No, that's not what I'm talking about.

255
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,469
Do I make you--

256
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,848
I make you happy, right?
I make you feel good.

257
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,267
- Mm-hmm, yes.
- We have a good time together?

258
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,270
- Yes.
- So why change it?

259
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:26,274
'Cause you're 25 years old.

260
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,568
That's the beauty of it.
We're different.

261
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,153
I have so many responsibilities.

262
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,739
I love your responsibilities.

263
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:35,074
We don't have a future.

264
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,203
We have a beautiful present.

265
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:41,831
We can have a future
if you'll let me try.

266
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:44,667
- Rui.
- Let me be part of your life.

267
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:46,502
Mmm.

268
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:57,555
<i>Must you dance<i>

269
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:02,393
<i>Every dance<i>

270
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:05,647
<i>With the same<i>

271
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:09,108
<i>Fortunate man?<i>

272
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:14,447
<i>You have danced with him<i>

273
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,784
<i>Since the music began<i>

274
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:21,746
<i>Won't you--<i>

275
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:34,926
And what about work?

276
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,096
How should we do that?

277
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,724
I mean, like total strangers?

278
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:45,770
We--We have to stop that, too.

279
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,772
Oh.

280
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:52,443
You know you promised to--
to keep me in work, right?

281
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,863
Said you would make me--

282
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:58,658
a staff photographer and all that?

283
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,745
That was very irresponsible.

284
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,374
A little.

285
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,628
That's okay, I guess.

286
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:20,763
If you need help with money,
I can always do that.

287
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,935
What was that, now?

288
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,689
Rose, you just never understand,
you never accept

289
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,649
how I feel about you,
you know?

290
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:33,943
What this means to me.
I actually love you.

291
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:36,279
I'm sorry about that.

292
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:01,763
And finally,
the "Day in the Life of the City" spread.

293
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,515
We've locked down the text.
And with regard to the photos,

294
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,061
Rose, I know you've suggested
your Brazilian photographer again.

295
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:11,147
And I just want to confirm
we're all very happy with that idea.

296
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,857
Well, I actually wanted
to make a suggestion.

297
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,151
I feel that we've been using him
a lot recently.

298
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,987
So there are two photographers
here whose work

299
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:20,615
I think might suit
this story better.

300
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,911
Well, thank you, everyone.

301
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:43,721
Laura?

302
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:54,023
Laura?

303
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,489
Eh.

304
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:05,678
Hi, uh, Harriet?

305
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,889
This is Rui.

306
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:11,225
Is Laura there with you?
Did she call you or something?

307
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,644
Because she's gone.
I don't know what happened.

308
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:16,814
She packed up everything
and she is gone.

309
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:19,692
I mean, she's really gone.

310
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,905
Yeah, okay,
if she calls you or anything,

311
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:27,867
just, uh, call me. Yeah.

312
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:30,995
Yeah, okay. Thank you.

313
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:11,035
Here's 80. Keep the change.

314
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,178
I'm in the kitchen!

315
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:36,143
- Hi.
- Hi, darling.

316
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,145
- You all right?
- Fine.

317
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,314
- You look lovely.
- Thank you.

318
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,527
- Um, have I got time for a shower?
- No, absolutely not. We're very late.

319
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:45,987
All right, fresh shirt.

320
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:48,197
There's one in the utility room.

321
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:50,449
Esther left it there.

322
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:16,434
When did you get home?

323
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:19,228
Oh, about half an hour ago.

324
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,204
I forgot, in the first year,
what was she?

325
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,623
A cloud.

326
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:43,210
And then,
memorably, a comet.

327
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,338
What is she this year?

328
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,048
A tree?

329
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:50,051
You've been away too much.
No, she's Shprintze.

330
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,552
Shprintze?

331
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,348
What is that?
Does it at least have a pulse?

332
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:59,352
It's a Ukrainian Jewess.
They're doing "Fiddler on the Roof."

333
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:02,688
And she--she's also got a line.

334
00:33:02,773 --> 00:33:05,274
Well?

335
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:08,319
"I think he has a pleasing air."

336
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:13,783
Is that it?

337
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:17,119
Uh, well, they--
she was going to say,

338
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:20,331
"Mama, Yente's coming," but they thought
that might be a bit much for her, so...

339
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:30,257
You're right.
I have been away too long.

340
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:37,348
How can Grandma's recipe
be world famous?

341
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,934
She never left the village
once in her life.

342
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,228
Don't be clever, Chava.

343
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,772
- Why not? I'll never be pretty...
- Excuse me.

344
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:47,525
- Or a good singer. Allow me to excel in something.
- Sorry.

345
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:50,695
I've seen Mosha outside.
He's so handsome.

346
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:52,446
Isn't he a little bit cross-eyed?

347
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,281
This is it.
This is her cue.

348
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,075
No, I think he's gorgeous.

349
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,744
Don't be silly.
He's hideous.

350
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:01,080
Shprintze, we need you to cast
the deciding vote.

351
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,874
What is he like?

352
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:09,588
Oh, God, she's dried.

353
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:13,300
"I think he has a pleasing air."

354
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,511
Since you have nothing
to say, Shprintze,

355
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,763
Tzeitel, what do you think?

356
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:21,767
- I think he has a pleasing air.
- Excuse me.

357
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:25,062
Motel's coming
and he's with Yente.

358
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:33,446
...seeing all the audience.

359
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,448
Feel a bit better?
Yes.

360
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:37,825
Okay. I don't remember
you wearing this in the play.

361
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,493
- No.
- You've stolen it from someone?

362
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,495
No.

363
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,456
It's a bit tight.

364
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,209
Suits you.

365
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:50,671
Mom, look what I have.
I have a beard.

366
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:53,174
I look like a man.

367
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:57,887
Yes, she was all right.
She did--

368
00:35:00,766 --> 00:35:02,558
She went out like a light.

369
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:03,601
Mmm.

370
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:06,187
She was totally exhausted.

371
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,983
You must be too.

372
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,027
Mmm.

373
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,237
Yeah.

374
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:18,324
It's been a crazy few days.

375
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,291
How did it go in Vienna?

376
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,044
Fine.

377
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,546
Did you get your deal done?

378
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:38,260
You did have a deal to do there,
didn't you?

379
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:42,306
- I did and I did.
- That's good. That's great.

380
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:55,236
That means a trip to Estonia
in the near future.

381
00:35:57,739 --> 00:35:59,990
Berlin, actually.

382
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:04,370
Do you know,
I've never been to Berlin.

383
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:07,873
- How was it here?
- It was fine.

384
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:15,005
I got your messages last night.

385
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,341
You sounded emotional.

386
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:20,719
Did I?

387
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:22,972
Am I wrong?

388
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:26,851
No.

389
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:32,606
Well, I tried to call you straight back,
but it went to voice-mail so...

390
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:39,029
Anyway, it was very nice what you said.

391
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,117
What did I say?

392
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,830
You said that you wished I was there.

393
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,211
It's true, I did.

394
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:56,505
That's nice.

395
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:52,186
Morning, Tyler.
So you asked to see me.

396
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,104
Clear.

397
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,815
I'm so pleased you agreed
to do this halfway house.

398
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,610
- Clear.
- Miss Olsen, I believe--

399
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:02,404
I believe I've done everything
you've asked me here.

400
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,657
You have. You've worked hard.

401
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:05,991
Yeah.

402
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,536
But what if I'm no different?

403
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,538
You know,
after everything we've done,

404
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:15,209
what if--
what if I haven't changed?

405
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:20,422
The way I'm feeling right now
is that maybe you were right--

406
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:22,633
maybe I should go
to that halfway house first...

407
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:26,428
for my own protection.

408
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,848
Because like you said,

409
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:33,686
I've been in--I've been
in an all-male situation here

410
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:36,772
for six--six years.

411
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:42,236
And it's going to be quite a shock
being on the outside with all the--

412
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,656
the temptations and distractions.

413
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,867
Yes, it is.

414
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:51,870
And I would hate for everything
that we've done together

415
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:53,831
to be undone.

416
00:38:57,419 --> 00:39:00,004
You said you'd spoken
to some people in Louisville

417
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:03,924
who have experience
working with people like me?

418
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:07,219
If I remember, they were even
happy to fly over here

419
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:10,931
to collect you and accompany you
on the plane.

420
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:13,434
On the plane?

421
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:16,395
No, they can--they can spare
themselves that.

422
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:19,398
They can just meet me
at the Louisville airport.

423
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:24,862
Tyler, I am so happy
that you've agreed to do this.

424
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:26,655
You think it's right?

425
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,283
- Yes, I do.
- 'Kay.

426
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:36,832
I never want to end up
in a place like this again.

427
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:51,532
Hi.

428
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,659
- Oh.
- Thank you.

429
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:56,161
I wasn't sure if you were hungry.

430
00:40:57,622 --> 00:41:00,541
So the choice is chicken or fish.

431
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,876
I got you chicken.

432
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:06,672
Though now I'm eating it myself,
I'm not sure which one I got.

433
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:09,341
- I'm not hungry.
- You sure?

434
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:12,219
They said they wouldn't
be coming around again.

435
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,513
Maybe some wine.

436
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,223
Okay, have mine as well.

437
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,559
You don't want it?

438
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,185
No, I've got some work to do.

439
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:23,939
Going direct to Denver?

440
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:28,110
- Miami.
- Oh.

441
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,320
Then home to Rio de Janeiro.

442
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:31,905
Oh.

443
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:35,367
Been in London long?

444
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:38,829
Too long, studying,

445
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:42,249
doing stupid jobs,

446
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,919
but mostly waiting at home while
my boyfriend slept with other women.

447
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,671
Oh.

448
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:50,632
That's bad.

449
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:52,509
Sorry to drink like this.

450
00:41:52,594 --> 00:41:54,553
It's not very elegant,
but I want to sleep.

451
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:57,639
That's okay, I understand.

452
00:41:57,724 --> 00:41:59,892
- You okay?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

453
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:01,685
Okay.

454
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,689
You a Manchester United fan?

455
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:31,173
Sorry.

456
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:34,092
It's okay. My daughter, Julia.

457
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,136
Missing?

458
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:37,971
Yes.

459
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:41,516
Sadly, some think she's long dead.

460
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:46,396
- I'm sorry.
- No.

461
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:48,398
She's beautiful.

462
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:49,942
Yes, she is.

463
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:52,110
You look so happy.

464
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:54,905
Yeah, I was.

465
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:03,038
It's before she ran away.
Thank you.

466
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:16,385
Where did she run to?

467
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:17,719
Huh?

468
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:20,222
America?

469
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,516
Yeah, eventually.

470
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,894
That's where we think she ended up.

471
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:28,730
Can I ask why?

472
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:31,024
- Why she ran away?
- Yeah.

473
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:34,778
Yes, you can, but I don't think
you'll like me when I've told you.

474
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,281
Is it important if I like you?

475
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:40,033
No, not remotely.

476
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:46,581
Well, my daughter and I have
the same initial, "J."

477
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:51,962
One day she opened the wrong letter
and found out I was having an affair.

478
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,089
She was devastated.

479
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:57,551
She told me if I didn't stop,
she would tell her mother.

480
00:43:58,428 --> 00:44:01,888
Of course I agreed to stop,
but I didn't.

481
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,683
I couldn't.

482
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:08,854
And so she told her mother.
Her mother screamed at me

483
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:12,858
and I screamed at my daughter.
My daughter ran away,

484
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:16,695
uh, presumably
to the arms of someone

485
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:19,239
who did her harm, I guess.

486
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:28,957
Your daughter--
Why do people think she's--

487
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:30,917
- Dead?
- Yes.

488
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:34,921
Oh, silence, mostly,
especially to her mother.

489
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:39,676
So unlike Julia.
That and the sheer length of time.

490
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:42,679
And you're going
to Phoenix because--

491
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:45,182
Arizona state police
have found the body of a woman

492
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:50,896
reported to be the same age,
um, white, British, died in a fire.

493
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:56,109
And I'm taking out samples of DNA,

494
00:44:56,194 --> 00:45:00,781
bits and pieces of Julia's hair
we kept from childhood.

495
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:02,366
Madness, really.

496
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:05,285
They closed the file
on Julia years ago.

497
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,872
Well, when you're a father,

498
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:11,625
- what can you do?
- Yeah.

499
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,460
You can't give up, you know?

500
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,337
- No.
- No.

501
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:17,339
- I'll see you.
- Yeah.

502
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,174
Bye.

503
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:36,733
Excuse me.

504
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:41,238
- Hi.
- You didn't get away either.

505
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:44,491
- No.
- I've heard them say it could be quite a wait.

506
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,076
- Really?
- Yeah, I also heard them say

507
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,328
they may be putting us
in hotels for the night.

508
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:51,623
Oh, God. They told me
to report back at 7:00.

509
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:55,168
Yeah, me too. I think that's to collect
the vouchers for the hotels.

510
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:57,504
Um, look, if you fancy it,

511
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:01,466
I saw a reasonably good restaurant
up there by the phones.

512
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:03,468
Maybe we could get together for an hour

513
00:46:03,553 --> 00:46:05,470
and, you know, in an hour's time
have something to eat?

514
00:46:05,555 --> 00:46:08,765
Because it beats eating room service
in our separate hotels.

515
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:10,559
What do you think?

516
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:12,144
- Yeah, okay.
- Good.

517
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:13,353
- Laura.
- Huh?

518
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:15,730
- Laura. I'm Laura.
- Oh.

519
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:17,607
- John.
- Okay.

520
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:19,526
Laura, pretty name.
All right, see you then.

521
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,069
- Thank you. See you.
- Bye.

522
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:50,390
How are you doing, Tyler?

523
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:52,726
It's crazy here.
There are people everywhere.

524
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:55,729
Some are crying.
Some are getting angry.

525
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,690
It's--it's just a stress situation.

526
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,901
I hear what you're saying
about everyone,

527
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:02,235
but how are you?

528
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:04,654
How are you doing?

529
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:08,074
What? I'm--I'm okay.

530
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:12,454
Um, though I'm beginning
to wish I had said yes

531
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:15,415
to those guys
escorting me on the flight.

532
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:19,336
If I'm honest,
I do feel a little, um...

533
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:22,756
triggered.

534
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,133
Well, I'm gonna make sure
we get help to you.

535
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:29,387
The second I hang up this phone,
that's what I'm going to get on to.

536
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:30,722
Okay?

537
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:33,308
But I want you to remember

538
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,435
that if you weren't able
to cope with this challenge,

539
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,270
it wouldn't have been presented to you.

540
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:38,563
You think?

541
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:40,774
Absolutely.

542
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:44,361
Now go find somewhere
quiet and safe to sit.

543
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:46,780
I'll make a few calls.
But I'd like for you to call me

544
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:50,283
in exactly an hour from now, okay?

545
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:51,993
One hour.

546
00:47:52,078 --> 00:47:53,537
You'll be fine.

547
00:47:55,498 --> 00:47:57,249
Thank you, Miss Olsen.

548
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,626
All right, take care.

549
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:28,989
That's my seat.

550
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,616
- Really?
- Didn't see my stuff?

551
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:33,994
What stuff?

552
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:36,663
The stuff that I left--
deliberately left right here.

553
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,873
No, I didn't see it. I'm sorry.

554
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:40,917
Well, you see it now, don't you?

555
00:48:41,002 --> 00:48:42,836
Yeah, I do.

556
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:47,132
Okay. Okay, no problem.
I can--can go.

557
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:48,842
Okay, folks.

558
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:52,929
Some wine, two glasses.

559
00:48:53,014 --> 00:48:55,724
And I'll get you some bread.

560
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:01,688
I'm sorry.

561
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:05,108
I--I ordered a drink
for me and my friend.

562
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:08,111
He'll be here in a second.

563
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,864
Can I just stay here
until he comes?

564
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,866
As soon as he comes,
we'll move.

565
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,951
I promise.

566
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,998
You want a glass of wine?

567
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:22,709
I don't want a glass of wine.

568
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,630
He shouldn't be long.

569
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:53,990
Where are you headed?

570
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:57,369
Uh, Louisville, Kentucky.

571
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,120
Rio, Brazil.

572
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,998
They give you a hotel room yet?

573
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:07,045
- Hotel room?
- Yeah. No, they did.

574
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:10,090
I'm just hoping these people
meet me here first.

575
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:13,843
I'm Laura, by the way.

576
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:15,804
Tyler.

577
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:20,892
You okay?

578
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:23,395
What's with all the questions?

579
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,522
Just being friendly.

580
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:31,236
- Switch seats with me.
- Sorry?

581
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,863
Would you mind
switching seats with me?

582
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:35,949
Uh, I'm waiting for some friends.

583
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:39,285
So if I sit here,
I can see them coming.

584
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:40,829
Oh, okay.

585
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:42,706
Okay, sorry.

586
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,590
So who's meeting you here?

587
00:50:53,134 --> 00:50:55,218
Just someone I met on the plane.

588
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,637
He sat next to me and we got talking.

589
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,306
Just talking? We just talkin', too?

590
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:04,436
What else are we doing?

591
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:09,524
Well, I don't know.
I mean, now I'm not doing anything.

592
00:51:10,735 --> 00:51:11,776
But you--

593
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:17,157
- What am I doing?
- You tell me.

594
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:22,704
I don't know. Just passing the time,
making conversation.

595
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:28,251
You ever been to Brazil?

596
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,086
No.

597
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:34,716
You would like it.
Everyone likes it.

598
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:37,969
We have the best beaches
in the world.

599
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:42,223
It's the first thing I'm going to do
when I get home,

600
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:44,184
go to the beach,

601
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:47,437
lie down, close my eyes,

602
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,440
and smoke a joint.

603
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:54,027
What?

604
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,695
You're bad.

605
00:51:57,198 --> 00:51:59,032
Me?

606
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,909
No, I'm not.

607
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:05,622
364 days of the year
I'm a good Catholic girl.

608
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:08,041
Right now I'm just feeding off
the situation.

609
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,751
What situation?

610
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,087
The situation we're in now.

611
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:17,300
No one knows where we are.
No one can reach us.

612
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:20,929
It's perfect.

613
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,014
For what?

614
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:28,394
I don't know.

615
00:52:31,941 --> 00:52:33,608
You tell me.

616
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,321
Stay there a second.

617
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,031
Okay?

618
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:52,085
His name's McGregor,
Tyler McGregor,

619
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,087
on flight 240 to Louisville.

620
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,089
He's newly released from jail

621
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,383
and he called me
in a highly stressed state.

622
00:52:58,467 --> 00:53:00,927
Ma'am, we have an airport shutdown
and 60 grounded flights.

623
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,929
We are extremely stretched.

624
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,806
I need to know if you consider
this McGregor

625
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,266
to be a threat to public safety.

626
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:07,809
It's hard to say.

627
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,811
I mean, I think
we'd all feel a lot better,

628
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:11,813
including him,
if you could keep an eye on him.

629
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,356
Ma'am, is that a yes or a no?

630
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:15,733
Yes.

631
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,695
Right, okay. Thank you,
I'll get back to you.

632
00:53:20,656 --> 00:53:23,116
Security to information desk, over.

633
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,159
This is information.
Go ahead, security, over.

634
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:29,205
Yeah, I need you to put out a call
for passenger McGregor,

635
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:35,295
- Tyler McGregor on flight 240 to Louisville, over.
- "McGregor... 240 to Louisville."

636
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:38,339
Yeah, tell him to report
to your desk immediately.

637
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:41,843
Is that it? No more information
than that?

638
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:44,012
He's a convicted sex offender.

639
00:53:44,096 --> 00:53:48,016
You want to put that out over
the loudspeaker, be my guest. Over.

640
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:51,561
Let's have a drink.

641
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:54,397
- Okay.
- Come with me.

642
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:58,192
- Um, I'm sorry.
- Oh.

643
00:53:58,277 --> 00:54:00,069
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

644
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:01,738
It's okay.

645
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:03,406
So? You want to come?

646
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,242
Yeah.

647
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:11,372
Would passenger McGregor

648
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:15,168
traveling on the 1830 flight 240 to Louisville

649
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,795
please report to the information desk
immediately?

650
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,715
That's passenger McGregor
to the information desk.

651
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,008
Thank you.

652
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:31,684
Sir, would you happen to be
John looking for Laura?

653
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:33,978
- Yeah.
- She described you well.

654
00:54:34,063 --> 00:54:35,772
She left a message for you.

655
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:37,857
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

656
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,911
Okay.

657
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:54,666
Welcome to my crib.

658
00:54:55,084 --> 00:54:57,126
Very luxurious.

659
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:01,464
One window, with a view of...

660
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:03,841
a brick wall.

661
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,303
Come on in.

662
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:09,138
I should really go.

663
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:11,975
Go where? Do what?

664
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:15,103
Come on, we're stuck here.

665
00:55:16,105 --> 00:55:17,480
Hmm?

666
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,072
Uh, I wonder could you help me?

667
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,324
Could you put out a call for a passenger
who's traveling to Miami?

668
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:29,242
Passenger's name?

669
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:31,619
Well, I don't know her last name,
but the first name is Laura.

670
00:55:31,704 --> 00:55:33,579
We arranged to meet
in the restaurant across by--

671
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:35,206
Okay, sir,
this is an information desk.

672
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:36,958
I know that, I know that.
But this young girl,

673
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,168
she's a kid and she could
be in trouble. She's missing.

674
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:41,254
Sir, I'm busy. I'm going to have
to ask you to step away--

675
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,880
One call, that's it. 30 seconds.
You could have done it by now.

676
00:55:42,965 --> 00:55:44,882
Hey, fellas, will you
get this guy out of here?

677
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:47,552
What's your problem?
Screw you.

678
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:49,387
Make yourself useful.

679
00:55:50,222 --> 00:55:52,557
Find us something to watch.

680
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:55,226
And relax, will you?

681
00:55:55,436 --> 00:55:59,981
So we have a $30 credit
for food and drink.

682
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:03,192
- But we're not hungry, right?
- No.

683
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:06,487
So let's celebrate instead,

684
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:09,365
or drown our sorrows.

685
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,242
Which?

686
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:16,414
- You've had too much already.
- Too much sorrows.

687
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:18,583
I agree.

688
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,503
No, too much to drink.

689
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,465
Don't be silly.

690
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,428
Yeah.

691
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,972
I really should go.

692
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:34,515
Why?

693
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:37,185
Why do you want to go?

694
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,980
Why does every man
nowadays want to leave me?

695
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:43,608
Is there something wrong with me?

696
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:44,901
No.

697
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,361
God, no, you're--

698
00:56:49,073 --> 00:56:50,573
you're fine.

699
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:54,577
- Then prove it.
- Please.

700
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:57,038
Kiss me.

701
00:56:57,915 --> 00:56:59,373
I can't.

702
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:02,210
Why not?

703
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:04,587
Kiss me, come on.

704
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:08,591
You're drunk.

705
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,385
You don't like me.

706
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:14,555
Then what's the problem?

707
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,849
What's the problem?

708
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:19,811
- What's the problem?
- Please don't do that.

709
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:21,979
Ah.

710
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,028
Say you're fuckin' sorry.

711
00:58:14,867 --> 00:58:16,868
Say you're fuckin' sorry.

712
01:00:10,983 --> 01:00:14,443
Hey, Laura? Laura.

713
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:16,487
Hey.

714
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,239
- Hey. Sorry.
- Hey.

715
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:20,533
- Hi.
- How you doing? All right?

716
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:23,703
- You okay? I was worried about you.
- I'm fine. Sore head.

717
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:25,997
- Hungover?
- Little bit.

718
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:27,999
- Yeah.
- Sorry about last night.

719
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:30,209
Ah, that's no problem.
I got your note. Thanks.

720
01:00:30,294 --> 01:00:31,627
- Nice note.
- Good.

721
01:00:31,712 --> 01:00:33,337
And so did you have fun?

722
01:00:33,422 --> 01:00:34,797
- I'm not sure.
- Oh.

723
01:00:35,257 --> 01:00:36,924
I think I must have fallen asleep.

724
01:00:37,009 --> 01:00:39,218
Oh, I know all about that stuff. Yeah.

725
01:00:39,303 --> 01:00:41,220
It's been a crazy few days.

726
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:42,722
I bet it has.

727
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:45,516
- Anyway...
- So...

728
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,019
- Good luck. Have a good journey.
- Yeah.

729
01:00:48,103 --> 01:00:49,687
You really take care now.

730
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,731
It was really nice
to meet you again.

731
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:53,566
It was great to talk to you.
Great to meet you.

732
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,568
- Maybe we'll meet again one day.
- Yeah.

733
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:02,241
- Okay.
- Okay.

734
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:04,243
- See ya.
- See ya. Travel safe.

735
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:05,995
Yeah, you stay out of trouble.

736
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,789
- I'm gonna try.
- I'm keeping my eye on you.

737
01:01:19,259 --> 01:01:21,093
Have a good flight.

738
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:40,404
You did it, Tyler.

739
01:01:40,489 --> 01:01:42,990
You made the call.
You did the right thing.

740
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:45,409
I'm so proud of you.

741
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:47,787
Stay in touch.

742
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:18,192
No, thank you.

743
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,487
Thank you.

744
01:02:24,116 --> 01:02:26,033
See you next time.

745
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:30,204
"See you next time."

746
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:34,291
They were four innocent enough words,
but they went through me like a knife.

747
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:36,961
Because in that moment, I realized to them
I'd become a familiar face,

748
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:41,132
a joke--the British guy
who was running a one-man campaign,

749
01:02:41,383 --> 01:02:43,092
stubbornly scratching away,
refusing to do

750
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:46,762
what you've all been urging me to do
for years and years,

751
01:02:46,847 --> 01:02:48,764
move on, let go, and all that stuff.

752
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:52,226
Yeah, it's not easy.

753
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:54,687
I got sober a long time ago
out in Los Angeles--

754
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:57,731
I don't know--
35, 36 years ago.

755
01:02:57,816 --> 01:02:59,984
And I was crazy. I was insane.
I was sickened to death,

756
01:03:00,068 --> 01:03:04,447
drunk and insane, and...
I was sentenced to AA meetings.

757
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:06,449
And I hated--
I hated the damn things.

758
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:10,411
I hated all this God stuff.
It made me want to puke.

759
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:13,956
You know, "Move on. Let go, let God.
Surrender and win" and all this.

760
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:17,209
I was a winner.
I've been a winner all my life.

761
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:20,212
And, uh...

762
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:22,214
but I was fighting all the time.

763
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:23,924
And anyway,
to cut a long story short,

764
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:27,261
I met-- there was this old man.
He was a priest,

765
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:31,015
a Jesuit priest. His name was Joe Riley,
Father Joe Riley.

766
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:33,225
And I'll never forget him
as long as I live.

767
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:36,770
One night I was about to leave the meeting.
I had to get the hell out.

768
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:39,315
And he stood in my way, said,
"Where the hell do you think you're going?"

769
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:40,900
I said, "You get out of my way."

770
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:42,902
He said, "You're not going anywhere."

771
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:45,863
But he looked up into my face,
and he had these piercing blue eyes,

772
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:48,032
a cigarette in his mouth.
He said, "You know--"

773
01:03:48,116 --> 01:03:50,367
He said, "You look like to me--
You look like

774
01:03:50,452 --> 01:03:53,078
you're busted, disgusted
and not to be trusted."

775
01:03:54,414 --> 01:03:55,998
And he was right.

776
01:03:57,626 --> 01:04:01,003
I wasn't to be trusted by anyone.
I'd never trust myself either.

777
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:03,214
And one day I asked him--
I said, "Okay, Father,

778
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:05,758
you know all the"--I called him Father
and he got a kick out of that.

779
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,801
I said, "You know all the answers.
You're a pretty smart guy.

780
01:04:07,886 --> 01:04:09,929
What's the shortest, most powerful
prayer in the world?"

781
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:11,472
'Cause I was fast.
I needed quick answers.

782
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:13,557
'Cause I wanted to be back
on the fast track.

783
01:04:13,642 --> 01:04:16,060
I said, "What is the fastest, most
powerful prayer in the world?"

784
01:04:16,144 --> 01:04:18,437
He said, "The fastest, most powerful
prayer in the world--"

785
01:04:18,522 --> 01:04:21,190
He looked at me and he said,
"The fastest, most powerful prayer in the world,

786
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:24,401
My friend, is 'Fuck it."'

787
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:26,946
Father Joe Riley.

788
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:30,241
He was a Jesuit priest--
"Fuck it." Can you believe it?

789
01:04:30,325 --> 01:04:32,993
He said, "it's the prayer
of release and surrender."

790
01:04:33,078 --> 01:04:36,997
And I felt the whole weight of the world
going off my shoulders.

791
01:04:37,165 --> 01:04:39,500
And just before Father Riley died,

792
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:42,294
I asked him--I said, "How do I get it?
How do I know?"

793
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:44,755
He said, "You will see
when you're ready to see.

794
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:46,882
You will hear when you're ready to hear."

795
01:04:46,967 --> 01:04:49,843
He said,
"You're a particularly tough nut."

796
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:54,181
And the weird thing is,
that happened two days ago.

797
01:04:54,266 --> 01:04:57,184
I was traveling on my way here--

798
01:04:57,269 --> 01:04:59,603
my journey here
with a young girl from Brazil.

799
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:02,731
She was a kid, beautiful little thing.
Name was Laura.

800
01:05:03,692 --> 01:05:05,693
And there was a snowstorm at Denver.

801
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:08,988
Flights were delayed
and so we arranged to have dinner.

802
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:10,948
And when I showed up,
she wasn't there.

803
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:13,784
But she left me this note.
Hold that, will you?

804
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:19,039
And she said,
"Ran into someone cute.

805
01:05:19,124 --> 01:05:22,209
"Never done this kind of thing before.

806
01:05:22,294 --> 01:05:24,920
"But you only live once.

807
01:05:25,005 --> 01:05:27,756
How many chances do we get?"

808
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:34,346
"Out of the mouths
of babies and sucklings,

809
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:37,182
thou hast perfected praise."

810
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:40,060
The guy was right,
whoever wrote that stuff.

811
01:05:40,145 --> 01:05:43,230
And it's taken me all these years.

812
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:46,442
I tell you, if my--

813
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:50,195
if my daughter is alive,

814
01:05:51,823 --> 01:05:54,992
she knows where I am,
where to find me.

815
01:05:55,076 --> 01:06:00,164
And her silence means that she's probably
made the choice not to be in touch.

816
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:02,333
But if she's dead...

817
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:07,588
then she's dead.

818
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:13,052
And she's gone forever.

819
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:15,721
And I have to move on

820
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:18,057
and forget and let go.

821
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:19,850
Weird stuff.

822
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:23,020
Wow.

823
01:06:24,022 --> 01:06:26,774
I tell you, it's a mystery, all of it.

824
01:06:26,858 --> 01:06:29,777
Anyway, I'll shut up now.
Thanks for listening.

825
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:31,236
Thank you, John.

826
01:06:32,864 --> 01:06:36,617
Okay, before I open the meeting
to our regular members,

827
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:39,161
we have another guest from overseas.

828
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:40,704
Valentina?

829
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:43,415
Yes. Hello, my name is Valentina.

830
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,834
Welcome, Valentina.

831
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:47,628
I'm an alcoholic.

832
01:06:49,047 --> 01:06:51,340
I'm here from Europe
visiting my sister,

833
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:53,884
waiting outside.

834
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:58,055
She has married an American
who lives here in Phoenix.

835
01:06:58,139 --> 01:07:01,809
And they're so happy, so in love.

836
01:07:01,893 --> 01:07:05,104
This makes me sick.

837
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:09,191
Tomorrow I will fly home
to my Russian husband.

838
01:07:12,112 --> 01:07:15,948
We married very young.
We were like children.

839
01:07:16,408 --> 01:07:19,785
But now we've grown up,
become different people.

840
01:07:23,915 --> 01:07:25,999
I am sober three years.

841
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:29,670
I have a good new job, a new life,

842
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:32,589
but he's still the same--

843
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:36,552
doing bad things,
working with bad people.

844
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:40,931
For a long time
I'm waiting for him to change.

845
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:43,517
And, um,

846
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:47,438
like Brazilian girl said,
"You only live once.

847
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:49,940
How many chances do we have?"

848
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,901
I don't want to wait anymore.

849
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:55,612
So maybe this is the time.

850
01:07:57,824 --> 01:08:01,160
Plus there is someone else
I am interested in.

851
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:06,874
Um, a nice man, a good man.
My boss, actually.

852
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:12,254
And he knows nothing from my past.

853
01:08:12,464 --> 01:08:15,340
He thinks I am a good innocent girl.

854
01:08:16,676 --> 01:08:20,804
But if we get together,
he will get a shock the first night.

855
01:10:13,293 --> 01:10:15,294
Valentina.

856
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:18,338
Valentina.

857
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:06,136
- Hi.
- Serioja.

858
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:09,348
I'm coming to the city tomorrow
and would like some company.

859
01:11:09,641 --> 01:11:11,558
What have you got for me?

860
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:14,061
Uh, who have you got for me?

861
01:11:14,145 --> 01:11:16,063
Best--I need the best.

862
01:11:17,357 --> 01:11:18,649
Kate?

863
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,652
Maybe, maybe.

864
01:11:21,736 --> 01:11:24,488
Maybe do you have a brunette?

865
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:28,784
Maybe do you have someone new?

866
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:16,178
<i>Bonjour.</i>

867
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:55,383
<i>Pardon.</i>

868
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:06,478
Problem?

869
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:29,501
<i>Attendez.</i>

870
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:32,045
<i>Voila.</i>

871
01:16:40,304 --> 01:16:41,304
Ow!

872
01:18:21,072 --> 01:18:22,405
Valentina...

873
01:19:11,956 --> 01:19:13,706
English is made up from words

874
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:15,250
borrowed from various languages.

875
01:19:15,334 --> 01:19:16,876
So words in English...

876
01:19:16,961 --> 01:19:19,003
Can give rise to pronunciation problems.

877
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:21,673
When "Y" comes
at the beginning of a word,

878
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:23,842
it acts as a consonant.

879
01:19:23,926 --> 01:19:25,844
- Yellow.
- Yellow.

880
01:19:25,928 --> 01:19:27,429
- Year.
- Year.

881
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:28,888
- Yet.
- Yet.

882
01:19:28,973 --> 01:19:30,682
- Yesterday.
- Yesterday.

883
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:33,685
- Yoke.
- Yoke, yoke.

884
01:20:17,313 --> 01:20:18,730
Mmm.

885
01:21:15,329 --> 01:21:16,788
Sacha!

886
01:22:15,014 --> 01:22:17,932
Remember, when two vowels go walking,

887
01:22:18,017 --> 01:22:20,143
only one does the talking.

888
01:22:21,186 --> 01:22:22,186
Repeat after me.

889
01:22:32,531 --> 01:22:35,908
No fucking aisle seat ever.

890
01:22:36,368 --> 01:22:38,494
Repeat after me.

891
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:42,957
- No...
- No...

892
01:22:43,042 --> 01:22:43,916
- fucking...
- fucking...

893
01:22:44,001 --> 01:22:45,043
- aisle seat.
- aisle seat.

894
01:22:45,127 --> 01:22:49,047
Don't park my fucking car
in the fucking airport parking.

895
01:23:55,322 --> 01:23:57,448
Ciao.

896
01:23:57,533 --> 01:23:59,200
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

897
01:24:09,586 --> 01:24:11,921
- Yes?
- You there yet?

898
01:24:12,005 --> 01:24:14,757
- Two minutes.
- Okay, you meet him at the bar.

899
01:24:14,842 --> 01:24:16,759
They are booking us for one hour.

900
01:24:16,844 --> 01:24:19,554
One hour?
You bring me here for one hour?

901
01:24:19,638 --> 01:24:21,973
Relax. Do the job good,

902
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:23,307
he will stay longer.

903
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:43,911
Okay.

904
01:24:52,004 --> 01:24:53,838
- Blanka?
- Yes.

905
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:57,049
Yes.

906
01:24:57,134 --> 01:24:58,885
I am Sergei.

907
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:01,095
- You are meeting with my boss today.
- Uh-huh.

908
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:11,314
- Hmm?
- Open it.

909
01:26:37,317 --> 01:26:38,776
You okay?

910
01:26:39,903 --> 01:26:41,821
Da. Thank you.

911
01:26:41,905 --> 01:26:43,447
No, you're not.

912
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:47,118
You're not okay.

913
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:49,370
Okay, I'm not okay, but it's okay.

914
01:27:26,033 --> 01:27:27,783
Close the door.

915
01:27:27,868 --> 01:27:29,327
Thank you.

916
01:27:30,203 --> 01:27:32,163
It's so cold.

917
01:27:32,247 --> 01:27:33,748
Yes.

918
01:27:35,542 --> 01:27:37,043
Where are you from?

919
01:27:38,378 --> 01:27:40,338
I am from Russia.

920
01:27:40,422 --> 01:27:42,340
- Russia?
- Yeah.

921
01:27:42,424 --> 01:27:44,425
I'm from Slovakia.

922
01:27:56,813 --> 01:27:58,606
Nice car.

923
01:27:58,690 --> 01:28:00,441
- Auto?
- Auto, yeah.

924
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:02,443
Thank you.

925
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:04,487
But it's not mine.

926
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:06,822
Your boss's?

927
01:28:07,032 --> 01:28:08,574
Yes.

928
01:28:10,744 --> 01:28:12,787
Must be important.

929
01:28:15,499 --> 01:28:16,791
What does he do?

930
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:20,753
Business.

931
01:28:20,837 --> 01:28:23,339
What kind of business?

932
01:28:25,842 --> 01:28:27,343
Business.

933
01:28:31,848 --> 01:28:35,518
Well, at least
the atmosphere is yours.

934
01:28:37,396 --> 01:28:39,522
The atmosphere.

935
01:28:42,275 --> 01:28:44,610
It's a nice place to be.

936
01:28:47,406 --> 01:28:48,864
That's a compliment.

937
01:28:55,956 --> 01:28:57,873
So many buttons.

938
01:29:00,377 --> 01:29:02,962
Yeah, this is interesting.

939
01:29:07,467 --> 01:29:09,301
So perfect.

940
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:13,597
Go for a drive?

941
01:29:15,684 --> 01:29:17,768
Just once around the Ring?

942
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:19,603
- Ring?
- Ring.

943
01:29:19,688 --> 01:29:22,148
Ring--You know--
You don't know "Ring"?

944
01:29:22,232 --> 01:29:23,649
Mm-mm.
What is this Ring?

945
01:29:23,734 --> 01:29:26,694
Ring is the most famous street in this city.

946
01:29:26,778 --> 01:29:28,279
It's a circle.

947
01:29:36,621 --> 01:29:38,080
Come on.

948
01:29:39,499 --> 01:29:41,500
Okay, let's try.

949
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:43,461
Let's try.

950
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:57,683
I've never been
in anything like this.

951
01:29:57,976 --> 01:29:59,643
Really?

952
01:29:59,728 --> 01:30:03,147
Why do some people
have these nice things

953
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:04,940
and others don't?

954
01:30:05,025 --> 01:30:06,567
I don't know.

955
01:30:06,651 --> 01:30:09,528
But I'm afraid
it doesn't make them happy.

956
01:30:11,782 --> 01:30:13,616
It would make me happy.

957
01:30:16,369 --> 01:30:17,745
Maybe, maybe.

958
01:30:19,915 --> 01:30:21,499
I'm Anna.

959
01:30:21,583 --> 01:30:22,708
I'm Sergei.

960
01:30:25,962 --> 01:30:28,130
- "Nice to meet you."
- Yes.

961
01:30:31,426 --> 01:30:34,929
- So you're a driver?
- Yes, I'm a driver...

962
01:30:36,515 --> 01:30:37,932
and bodyguard.

963
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:41,352
What?

964
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:42,520
- Dog.
- Dog?

965
01:30:42,604 --> 01:30:47,274
Dog, yes. I must be dog
because this is how my boss treats me.

966
01:30:48,110 --> 01:30:49,568
It's not a joke.

967
01:30:50,362 --> 01:30:52,029
Sorry.

968
01:30:52,114 --> 01:30:53,781
No problem.

969
01:30:53,865 --> 01:30:56,158
So why don't you leave?

970
01:30:56,243 --> 01:30:57,910
I will.

971
01:30:57,994 --> 01:31:00,454
- I will soon.
- Mm-hmm.

972
01:31:00,664 --> 01:31:02,665
Maybe start again, a new life.

973
01:31:02,749 --> 01:31:04,708
- New life?
- New life, yes.

974
01:31:04,793 --> 01:31:06,001
Nice.

975
01:31:21,393 --> 01:31:23,227
So many books.

976
01:31:24,896 --> 01:31:26,814
Yes! All yours?

977
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:28,524
Yes.

978
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:32,903
My boss doesn't read.

979
01:31:33,572 --> 01:31:35,406
He doesn't need to.

980
01:31:37,617 --> 01:31:39,410
Reading is for dreamer--

981
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:41,203
poor dreamers.

982
01:31:41,997 --> 01:31:43,581
Do you read?

983
01:31:43,665 --> 01:31:45,207
All the time.

984
01:31:46,376 --> 01:31:47,501
Good.

985
01:31:49,546 --> 01:31:52,006
Poor dreamer.

986
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:06,687
Come on. Come on, sugar.

987
01:32:45,644 --> 01:32:46,977
Blanka.

988
01:32:47,562 --> 01:32:49,396
Blanka.

989
01:32:54,236 --> 01:32:56,278
Blanka.

990
01:34:17,152 --> 01:34:18,402
Hello.

991
01:34:19,195 --> 01:34:21,989
I want some tea on room 823.

992
01:34:59,527 --> 01:35:01,487
Ah, oh!

993
01:35:03,448 --> 01:35:04,865
Ah!

994
01:35:30,308 --> 01:35:33,352
That's it.
We've come full circle.

995
01:35:33,436 --> 01:35:36,522
Pity. I enjoyed it.

996
01:35:39,067 --> 01:35:40,484
Me too.

997
01:35:43,905 --> 01:35:46,198
It was nice meeting you.

998
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:49,076
You too.

999
01:36:02,966 --> 01:36:05,050
You're not going to answer it?

1000
01:36:12,225 --> 01:36:13,684
Goodbye.

1001
01:36:16,813 --> 01:36:18,730
Goodbye.

1002
01:36:18,815 --> 01:36:20,649
Goodbye.

1003
01:36:57,270 --> 01:36:59,771
Hello?

1004
01:37:39,187 --> 01:37:40,812
Excuse me.

1005
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:43,941
Thank you.

1006
01:37:56,412 --> 01:37:59,289
- Which floor?
- Eight.

1007
01:38:10,009 --> 01:38:13,178
Flu, always goes to my lungs.

1008
01:38:20,061 --> 01:38:21,895
Have a good day.

1009
01:40:02,246 --> 01:40:04,247
Hi.

1010
01:40:04,332 --> 01:40:05,999
Hi.

1011
01:40:06,084 --> 01:40:08,001
- Hi again.
- Hi.

1012
01:40:11,214 --> 01:40:13,423
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

1013
01:40:14,008 --> 01:40:15,092
Come.

1014
01:40:15,176 --> 01:40:16,760
I can't.
I'm waiting for my sister.

1015
01:40:16,844 --> 01:40:18,428
Let's go, come on.

1016
01:40:18,513 --> 01:40:19,471
To do what?

1017
01:40:20,765 --> 01:40:22,391
I don't know.

1018
01:40:22,475 --> 01:40:24,559
When are you coming back?

1019
01:40:24,644 --> 01:40:25,769
I don't know.

1020
01:40:25,853 --> 01:40:28,605
- You don't know that either?
- No. Come on.

1021
01:40:28,690 --> 01:40:31,066
- I can't.
- Come on, let's go.

1022
01:40:31,150 --> 01:40:32,609
Come on.

1023
01:40:36,364 --> 01:40:38,407
Come on.

1024
01:40:38,491 --> 01:40:40,283
Okay.

1025
01:40:58,428 --> 01:41:01,555
"After what happened,
I can't stay in your house."

1026
01:41:03,141 --> 01:41:05,142
- House, house, house.
- House is...

1027
01:41:05,226 --> 01:41:06,810
- Yes, yes.
- the same in Slovak.

1028
01:42:52,667 --> 01:42:55,210
So did you settle whatever you
needed to settle back home?

1029
01:42:55,294 --> 01:42:57,045
I'm sorry?

1030
01:42:57,129 --> 01:42:59,172
There must have been
something the matter

1031
01:42:59,257 --> 01:43:02,217
or else you wouldn't have wanted
to see Blanka in the first place, right?

1032
01:43:02,301 --> 01:43:03,635
Yes.

1033
01:43:03,719 --> 01:43:05,220
And yes.

1034
01:43:06,222 --> 01:43:09,349
God, it's brutal--
marriage, just brutal.

1035
01:43:09,433 --> 01:43:11,518
That's why I won't
have anything to do with it.

1036
01:43:11,602 --> 01:43:13,728
Like religion--all that cruelty
in the name of kindness.

1037
01:43:13,813 --> 01:43:17,232
I don't share that point of view.
I'm hopeful.

1038
01:43:17,316 --> 01:43:18,692
Or I'm stupid.

1039
01:43:19,735 --> 01:43:21,778
Or I'm still in love.

1040
01:43:21,863 --> 01:43:23,363
This is my wife.

1041
01:43:23,447 --> 01:43:25,240
She's been in an art gallery,

1042
01:43:25,324 --> 01:43:27,868
and spending too much
on our daughter.

1043
01:43:27,952 --> 01:43:29,202
Mmm.

1044
01:43:29,287 --> 01:43:31,037
And this is Peter. Rose.

1045
01:43:31,122 --> 01:43:32,622
- Hello. How do you do?
- Very nice to meet you.

1046
01:43:32,707 --> 01:43:34,875
Darling, we have to go
to the airport. We're late.

1047
01:43:34,959 --> 01:43:38,086
- I'll be in touch with you about the contacts.
- Absolutely.

1048
01:43:38,170 --> 01:43:42,549
- So spending money?
- Oh, I just bought some kids' clothes.

1049
01:43:44,093 --> 01:43:45,302
Taxi.

1050
01:44:07,241 --> 01:44:09,242
Wow.

1051
01:44:15,833 --> 01:44:18,418
A drink? No.

1052
01:44:21,047 --> 01:44:23,798
I don't need a drink to relax.

1053
01:44:26,677 --> 01:44:30,513
<i>This blinding kiss<i>

1054
01:44:30,598 --> 01:44:34,517
<i>Breathes helium<i>

1055

<i>Speak for themselves<i>

1063
01:45:06,509 --> 01:45:09,886

<i>In Chinatown<i>

1069

<i>Everything's cheap<i>

1070
01:47:06,962 --> 01:47:08,797

1071
