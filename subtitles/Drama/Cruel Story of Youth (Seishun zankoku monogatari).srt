11
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,476
Can you give me a lift?

12
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,439
Sure.

13
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,790
- Where are you going?
- To Sugamo.

14
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,878
I'm going somewhere else.

15
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,874
Mako!

16
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,072
This one's okay!

17
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,598
- Do you often ask for lifts?
- Sometimes.

18
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,030
Why?
There's public transport.

19
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,750
This is more fun.

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,399
Bye.

21
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,513
It's not this way.

22
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,157
- Fancy a bite?
- Alright.

23

HOTEL

24
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,550
I'd better go home, it's late.

25
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,115
- No, it's not.
- Take me home.

26
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,198
- Come on, don't be like that.
- Bye.

27
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,354
Come on!

28
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,869
- No!
- Come on, please!

29
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,314
- No!
- Damn you!

30
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,031
- Who was your friend?
- He was just taking me home.

31
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,914
Let's go!

32
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,311
- Where?
- To the police.

33
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,794
You're kidding!

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,991
What if I hadn't turned up?

35
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,029
- Take that.
- You fool!

36
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,309
BLOODY RIOTS
IN SOUTH KOREA

37
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,671
On April 19th,

38
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,873
a crowd led by university students

39
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,516
walked along the main roads
in protest.

40
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,955
There were clashes with the police
during the demonstration.

41
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,553
Hi.

42
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,400
Why didn't you wait for me?

43
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,591
You weren't on time.

44
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,070
- Do you smoke?
- No. Did you think I smoked?

45
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,478
- Aren't you old enough?
- What do you mean?

46
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,436
Too young to smoke
or to seek adventure?

47
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,475
I'm not into adventures.

48
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,076
Did you only want a lift?

49
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,554
Of course.

50
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,317
You don't feel like sex, I imagine.

51
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,158
Not at all!

52
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,793
What about the money?

53
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,949
Why do girls try and attract
middle-aged men?

54
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,074
They're innocent enough
at the start...

55
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,113
But if that guy had been smarter...

56
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,353
- Hi.
- Hi.

57
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,352
He's a friend of mine,
he's joined the movement.

58
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,679
Let's go.

59
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,314
We have that money to spend.

60
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,798
No! Please!
I can't swim!

61
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,430
- Will you do as I say?
- No.

62
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,232
Too bad for you.

63
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,952
Why don't you want to?

64
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,756
So why did you come then?

65
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,077
You're curious about men?

66
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,670
For sex? I'll satisfy that curiosity.

67
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,511
Don't you hate me?

68
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,428
You didn't do it
because you hate me?

69
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,236
At first, I was angry.

70
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,354
But not only at you.

71
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,637
At who then?

72
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,992
Everyone!

73
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,709
You asked me why I came.

74
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,669
- I didn't want to at first.
- Why not?

75
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,958
I was embarrassed
about last night.

76
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,400
I wanted to set things straight.

77
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,312
Is it all clear now?

78
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,275
We were tired,
so we came home.

79
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,950
- The rent, please!
- You're making us pay!

80
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,152
- Do you want us to go?
- You don't have to do that.

81
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,477
Alright, give us an hour.

82
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,316
Lock the door!

83
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,034
- You've had enough to drink.
- I learnt from you.

84
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,030
You'll wet the bed.

85
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,717
There's something I want to ask you.

86
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,159
Go on.

87
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,552
- It won't make you angry?
- Go ahead, ask me.

88
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,191
Do you like me?

89
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,028
Of course.

90
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,077
Shall we go?

91
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,718
How much is it?

92
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,399
You seem very happy.

93
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,355
Are you taking your latest catch
for a quickie?

94
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,471
- I already did that.
- You work fast!

95
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,433
Are you ready to dump her?

96
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,316
Do you need help?

97
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,874
There are other ways to get lucky!

98
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,751
- When'll I see you? You'll call?
- Yes.

99
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,078
Call me.

100
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,113
It's my friend's number.

101
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,318
Her name's Yoko.

102
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,918
There's no need for you
to take me home.

103
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,070
Take your part of the money.

104
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,158
- Keep it till next time.
- I'll spend it.

105
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,833
I'll take you home.

106
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,313
My sister.

107
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,353
Mr. Fuji took me home. My sister.

108
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,154
- Thanks a lot.
- Bye.

109
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,793
Bye.

110
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,839
What happened?
You look a mess.

111
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,600
- I fell into the water.
- How?

112
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,078
We hired a motor boat.
It was fun.

113
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,799
Yoko, didn't anyone call me?

114
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,679
No.

115
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,516
- It's been almost a week!
- What happened between you two?

116
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,438
You'd better tell me.

117
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,798
Are you going home?
I'm staying a bit longer.

118
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,514
See you tomorrow.

119
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,158
Go away! It's over between us!

120
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,393
Sorry.

121
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,796
Kiyoshi will be late...

122
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,718
But I know where he is.

123
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,398
You're lucky.

124
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,391
There's a call for you.

125
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,951
Guess who it is!

126
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,830
You didn't call me.

127
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,712
I wanted to leave you.

128
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,992
What? Why?

129
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,992
For what reason?

130
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,395
No special reason.

131
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,755
Listen,
I'm seeing another woman.

132
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,669
A nice girl like you should
stay away from guys like me.

133
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:11,552
The night I met you, I'd just
dropped her off at her hotel.

134
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,754
Let's meet one more time at least!

135
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,552
We'd better not.

136
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,639
No, you have to see me.

137
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,631
You said you liked me!

138
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,877
Hello, it's me.

139
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,832
I'm sorry.

140
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,670
Why did you take her to your room?

141
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,071
Anyhow, see you at the bar.

142
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,232
Are you worried because she called?

143
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,998
Of course.

144
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,953
- Do you want to see her?
- Yes.

145
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,435
But you won't, will you?

146
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,914
Why not?

147
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,393
- I'm going.
- I won't let you go.

148
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,838
Who's he?

149
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,712
Maybe he's not coming.

150
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,069
He'll come.

151
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,635
You can't trust men.

152
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,239
I can.

153
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,710
It's so late,
I'd better go home.

154
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,397
Are you staying?

155
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,472
Wait in your room.

156
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,992
I'll take you home.

157
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,394
There's no need.

158
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,034
- Three's a crowd.
- Maybe.

159
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,430
Will you be okay on your own?

160
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,753
Yes, no problem.

161
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,791
Okay, bye.

162
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,399
Bye.

163
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,598
Miss, where are you going?

164
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,756
- Do you want to go dancing?
- No.

165
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,520
Come on, we know about you.

166
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,917
- Play the game.
- I can't dance.

167
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,192
- But I'll have a drink.
- Good.

168
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,589
A toast to friendship.

169
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,593
It's a pity those two
left you on your own.

170
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,075
Come on! Knock it down!

171
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,395
Drink!

172
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,513
Let's dance!

173
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,116
What's going on here?

174
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,834
Do you want to steal our girl?

175
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,598
Sorry.

176
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,991
What are you doing?

177
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,714
- You're drunk.
- Alright, cut it out.

178
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,033
It'd cost you a lot
to ruin this place.

179
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,390
Go outside and sort it out.

180
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,238
Alright.

181
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,278
Are you with me?

182
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,871
I'll be referee.

183
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,797
Stop it!

184
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,478
That's enough.

185
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,075
You're not bad, kid.

186
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,475
But stay away from those yobs.

187
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,678
You got me? Stop it.

188
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,077
- What about you?
- We want to continue.

189
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,195
Their job is prostituting women
and ripping them off.

190
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,998
It's a shame they got your girl.

191
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,596
It looks like business is slow.

192
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,192
How about paying back with money?

193
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,030
- Any objection?
- No.

194
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,594
- No hard feelings?
- No.

195
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,035
- How much?
- Ten thousand yen.

196
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,312
- But he's a kid!
- Alright, five thousand.

197
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,351
I don't have it.

198
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,394
Bring it to the bar tomorrow.

199
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,590
Alright. Now go.

200
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,639
- Aren't you going?
- You go first.

201
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,077
Why do you do this to me?

202
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,835
Tell me! Why has this happened?

203
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,032
Why do you do it?

204
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,348
You know you don't love me!

205
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,070
- Tell me, why?
- Stop it!

206
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,672
I... love you.

207
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,830
That's why I hate doing it like this,
if you don't love me!

208
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,359
But it happens every time
we see each other.

209
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,758
So I don't want to see you anymore.

210
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,070
You're wrong to think
you can treat me like this.

211
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,035
I never want to see you again.

212
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,959
- I love you.
- That's not true.

213
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,277
I really do love you!

214
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,959
- You're lying!
- It's the truth.

215
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,718
Are you sure?

216
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,758
Are you sure?

217
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,033
You lied at the bar the other day.

218
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,717
Aren't you telling the truth today?

219
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,398
Maybe it's...

220
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,755
You can never leave me.

221
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,038
Don't even think about it.

222
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,112
Do you still love me?

223
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,197
Of course.

224
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,351
I'd better go home.

225
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,552
Home?

226
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,874
To get my books and go to school.

227
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,189
I'll try and come tonight,

228
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,392
but if I don't come,
call me at Yoko's house.

229
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,994
Don't forget this time.

230
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,638
Where have you been?

231
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,438
Tell me.

232
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,389
I'm sorry.

233
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,509
- Where did you sleep?
- You'll shout at me, if I tell you.

234
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,400
It's never happened before.

235
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,958
Thank heavens!

236
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,759
You were stricter
when I was Mako's age.

237
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,956
Now daddy never tells you off.
Right?

238
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,151
I have to work late.

239
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,838
What about you?

240
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,112
I'll stay to hear
what she has to say.

241
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,038
Tell your sister,
then she'll tell me.

242
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,279
Where are you going?

243
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:50,278
- I'll be late for school.
- No! You're going to explain.

244
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,472
- Why?
- It's that student, isn't it?

245
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,910
He's no good!

246
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:02,953
You met him the other day
in an unmentionable place.

247
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:08,031
How far has your relationship gone?
Tell me.

248
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,518
I don't want to.

249
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,796
Why should I?
I'll miss school, I need to sleep.

250
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,348
Mako!

251
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,308
Come in.

252
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,712
Come home.

253
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,871
I'll come soon...

254
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,993
not now.

255
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,758
Why not?

256
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,871
No special reason.

257
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,071
It's for your own good.

258
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,795
Quit now, before you get hurt.

259
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,113
Like you?

260
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,319
Yes.

261
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:46,833
You told me you never came home
late when you were young.

262
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,715
Exactly! Mom and dad were strict.

263
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,750
The world wasn't such
an open-minded place...

264
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,633
And anyway, I had my fun
when I was young.

265
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:06,157
You lost...
and now you hang around in hotels.

266
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,434
That's why you lost.

267
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:13,679
I had real dreams...
not empty ones like you!

268
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,478
But you lost because you were weak.

269
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,472
And are you two sure
you won't lose?

270
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:26,553
Are you sure your love story
won't finish?

271
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,434
Yes.

272
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,757
It won't work!
The passion will die soon

273
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,316
and leave its place to unhappiness.

274
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,160
Then it will be too late!

275
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,154
She's right.
You'd better go home!

276
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,194
No, I'm coming to live here.

277
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,958
Really?

278
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,434
I've just decided.

279
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:53,428
So, from now on,
you'll pay your own way.

280
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,155
Fine.

281
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,957
Goodbye to you both.

282
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,918
What about school?

283
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,156
- I'm coming.
- Bye.

284
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,511
- Is that alright?
- Yes.

285
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,315
I'll get my stuff tomorrow.
Can I move in here?

286
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,948
Of course.

287
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,748
You didn't show up,
so we came.

288
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,952
- I was on my way.
- You're a good kid!

289
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,798
Let's have a drink.

290
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,799
Lend me your motorbike.

291
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,837
- Have you got the money?
- I borrowed it.

292
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,951
There's no point in paying them.

293
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,833
- We can make more money.
- How?

294
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,838
You go and ask for a lift
and I'll follow you.

295
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,350
When he comes on to you,
I'll show up.

296
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,678
It worked last time!

297
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,319
- Sounds like fun.
- Will you do it?

298
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,910
- What if the guy doesn't come on?
- That's your problem.

299
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,918
If he doesn't,
I'll beat him up!

300
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,553
That's a deal!

301
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,751
Sorry! I must've fallen asleep!

302
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,315
Right! And your mouth was wide open.

303
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,559
They made me drink six cocktails.

304
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,433
- Who?
- Those guys.

305
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,957
I'll get out here.

306
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,470
- Why?
- I'm still a bit drunk.

307
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,559
I can't go home like this,
I'll have a rest.

308
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,513
- Where?
- At the Jazz bar.

309
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,795
- That's no place for you!
- It's the only one I know.

310
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,834
Alright, I'll take you there.

311
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,990
- I didn't want a hotel!
- You said you wanted to rest!

312
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,668
What are you doing
to that poor girl?

313
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,031
Do you want to go to the police?

314
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,637
I'll take her home.

315
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,398
You'll pay for the cab.

316
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,275
Miss Makoto Shinjio,
Year 3, class B.

317
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,472
Looks like you're in trouble.

318
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,797
I've heard some bad rumors!

319
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,912
Surely not about Mako.

320
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:35,073
I heard about your relationship
so I called your sister.

321
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,788
She said it wasn't true
and I feel relieved.

322
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,316
Have you got a boyfriend?

323
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,638
I hope you're not too involved
in this relationship with him.

324
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,355
You'd better not take it seriously.

325
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,794
Don't get too serious
like your sister here.

326
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,555
Her romance kept us
in suspense...

327
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,598
when we were young!

328
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,998
Don't say that!

329
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,157
Do you still see Akimoto?

330
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,033
Never.

331
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:17,628
In our days,
young people were too shy.

332
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,599
You didn't even used to hold hands!

333
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,633
Give me one.

334
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:35,238
Nowadays,
girls even sleep with men!

335
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:46,910
Be careful, it's hard
to live the rumors down.

336
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,513
Who spoke about me?

337
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,312
It doesn't matter.

338
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,634
I'm glad you didn't say anything!

339
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,558
Two months have gone by.

340
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,549
Is everything alright?

341
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,472
I envy you, in a certain way.
How are things?

342
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,514
I'm meeting Yoko, I have to go.
Bye.

343
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,394
I think taking part in the student
demonstrations is stupid.

344
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:34,559
Why don't we think about
getting married instead?

345
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,757
I thought about it.

346
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,595
I envy Mako!

347
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,955
They live in such a dingy room
but they're so in love!

348
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,709
I wouldn't let you live
in a dump like this!

349
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,114
Are you sure?

350
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:04,192
Why don't you live with me
for a while?

351
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,637
You made me wait.

352
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,917
Good.

353
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,795
I'm Yoko, I met him here.

354
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,714
I'm Fujii. What's happening?

355
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,797
Nothing special.

356
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,514
Mako's going to be a bit late.

357
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,879
I'm going to buy something.

358
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,078
Lady-killer!

359
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,751
Have you come to show off
your new lover?

360
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,919
Don't be like that! Come on!

361
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,870
Have some fun!

362
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,071
Instead of lecturing me,

363
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,952
why don't you think
about your future?

364
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,356
Not Beethoven!

365
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,670
The school fees...

366
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,636
- What?
- Did you pay them?

367
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,308
Yes, all of them!

368
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,559
Good! How did you get the money?

369
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,675
From her?
You get things easily!

370
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,111
I went to school just for a change.

371
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,518
They told me of the class cutbacks.

372
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:54,634
State schools are easier.
They're not very strict there!

373
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,470
What would you do if
I told her about your ex-lover?

374
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,990
That's a cowardly joke!

375
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,113
Cowardly?

376
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,034
You never know.
I could blow the gaff.

377
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:26,628
- Drink.
- You think I can't?

378
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,190
Don't make him drink too much!

379
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,389
I've had more than him.
I can drink loads.

380
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,792
A nice whisky like this!

381
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,037
Mako, your man's bad!

382
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,430
Why do you spread those rumors?

383
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,354
I never said anything about you.

384
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,516
Then how come everyone knows?

385
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,712
Maybe somebody saw you with him.

386
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,718
And the fact that we live together?

387
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,075
If you don't like it,
you shouldn't have started.

388
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,398
I never asked you to leave home!

389
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,994
There's no point getting angry now.

390
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,755
Say something!

391
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,749
Don't let him take it out on her!

392
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,715
Maybe she's not happy.

393
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,551
Doesn't Mako look happy?

394
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,069
That might be true,
but it's not my fault!

395
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,951
You're cruel!

396
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,038
I'm taking Mako home,
she can stay with me!

397
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,558
But they live together

398
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,870
because they love each other!

399
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,918
Are you drunk?

400
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,634
I've never been so drunk.

401
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,276
Don't walk out on me again!
Get up!

402
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,479
I'll tell them!

403
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,599
What?

404
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,955
No! Have a heart!

405
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,669
Mako, is Yoko a good
friend of yours?

406
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,997
Yes, she's my best friend.

407
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,996
Do you want to know
a really terrible thing?

408
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:42,277
You two look so close...

409
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,950
but your boyfriend has another woman.

410
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,072
She looks really horrible
but she is a woman.

411
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:57,634
She used to come here
and sleep with her, in that bed!

412
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,352
Mako, is it true?
Did you know?

413
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,795
What if I had known?

414
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,594
You knew!

415
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:19,072
How two-faced of you!
Liar!

416
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,353
No!

417
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,717
Did you get your period?

418
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:20,914
No.

419
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,992
Let's go out!

420
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,914
- Have you got any money?
- We'll make some!

421
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,758
In the same way?

422
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,871
Don't count on me.

423
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,274
Why?

424
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,871
I don't know.

425
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,150
Come on, be good!

426
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,269
What if I refuse?

427
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,676
I'm kidding, let's do it?

428
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:23,272
What's wrong?
Why are you so quiet?

429
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,436
You were rather happy a while ago!

430
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,309
You're crying! What's happened?

431
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,952
I'm sorry.

432
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,637
Don't be sorry.

433
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,474
I feel so sad today!

434
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,353
Has something bad happened?

435
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,028
Nothing serious.

436
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:54,358
Tell me about it, you'll feel better.

437
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,552
I can't tell you.

438
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,710
Maybe I can help you.

439
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,711
Thanks all the same...

440
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,996
but I can't tell you.

441
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,389
I can't stand next to
a beautiful girl like you

442
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,909
and watch her cry.

443
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,918
I'm sorry! I'll stop.

444
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,959
I'll get out here.

445
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,991
- Let me out.
- Why?

446
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:49,477
I wouldn't sleep if I went home,
I'll kill some time somewhere.

447
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,035
- Where?
- In a tea house.

448
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:56,511
You shouldn't, not on your own.

449
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,074
I'll find a friend.

450
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,918
That's even worse!

451
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,956
I feel awful! I'll get drunk!

452
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,069
Wait!

453
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,716
Do you want to come with me?

454
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,192
Will you listen to my story?

455
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,232
You should go home.

456
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,954
Let's go someplace you know.

457
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,559
No.

458
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,754
Let me out here then.

459
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:39,592
You asked me to take you home!

460
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,313
I can't leave you
in a place like this!

461
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,070
Are you angry?

462
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,839
No.

463
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,632
Do you always drink when you're sad?

464
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,878
Sometimes.

465
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,392
That's not good.

466
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:04,229
I only drink when I'm happy,
so I get even happier.

467
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,558
And when you're sad?

468
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:12,514
I don't drink,
it'd just make things worse.

469
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,637
What do you do then?

470
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,598
I go home and cry myself to sleep.

471
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,072
You cry?

472
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,430
You cry yourself to sleep?

473
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,198
When I was young!

474
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,199
You see! You feel better already!

475
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,559
Thanks.

476
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:39,988
Goodnight.

477
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,719
I'll cry myself to sleep.

478
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,148
Good.

479
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,679
Goodbye.

480
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,517
I let this one get away!

481
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,073
That's never happened.

482
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,555
I wasn't in the mood.

483
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,439
What was he like?

484
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,870
He was a kind, old man.

485
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:10,392
Much kinder
than you were to me today!

486
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,469
Get in, come on!

487
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,999
This is my house.

488
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,352
You forgot?

489
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,679
I think I'll stay here tonight.

490
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,870
We can sleep alone
every now and again.

491
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,553
Who is it?

492
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:51,954
It's Makoto.

493
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,191
How come you're back?

494
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,038
There's no need to say it!

495
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,995
Nowadays, young people...

496
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,910
You're so understanding!
Why weren't you so nice to me?

497
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,554
- Times have changed.
- That's not true!

498
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,035
You never stood up to mom!

499
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,949
Times were hard after the war...

500
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:40,232
We thought we had new horizons.

501
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:44,911
We started again
as a democratic nation...

502
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:50,878
It was a responsibility that
went hand in hand with freedom...

503
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:54,595
But what can I say
to this girl today?

504
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:59,000
I don't want to tell
her what she shouldn't do.

505
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,113
You disappoint me.

506
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,957
To think you didn't keep
to what you said

507
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,276
when you left this house.

508
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,717
- Is Mr. Akimoto here?
- Come in.

509
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,033
Thanks.

510
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,551
Hi, Yuki!

511
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,790
I was passing by.

512
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,514
Come in,

513
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,593
have a seat.

514
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,319
- Have you got time?
- All the time you want.

515
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:53,550
The hustle and bustle
will start later.

516
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:57,035
Just patients these days?

517
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:02,473
Yes, we've stopped doing
the other things.

518
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,272
The voluntary workers left.

519
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,035
There's just the clinic left.

520
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:13,354
At least you're still
trying to fulfill your dreams.

521
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,878
I do wonder sometimes.

522
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:19,074
Akimoto, did you hate me?
Did I disappoint you?

523
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,596
It's an old story,
I've forgotten about it.

524
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,236
When we were young

525
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,157
we wanted to change society.

526
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:55,189
But we were young,
we made many mistakes.

527
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,949
Our wall hasn't fallen down.

528
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:10,995
By being impatient
we ended up hurting each other.

529
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:20,076
I didn't blame you
for choosing an older man!

530
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,273
Why are you laughing?

531
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:29,632
I thought I'd sorted myself out,
but I hadn't.

532
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,311
Doctor, that sick guy...

533
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,676
Patient!

534
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,279
The patient.

535
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,431
What's with the formalities?

536
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,751
I thought you were angry.

537
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,234
What nonsense!

538
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,911
About last night.

539
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:06,199
- I'm not angry.
- How come?

540
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,556
I understand.

541
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,068
Thanks.

542
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,676
I think I'm pregnant.

543
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,756
Have you seen a doctor?

544
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,871
But we can't have a child.

545
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,632
Have an abortion.

546
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,077
Last night didn't go well,
let's try again.

547
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,792
You'll feel better.

548
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:29,989
No.

549
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:33,757
Why not? Abortions cost money.

550
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,598
What's wrong?

551
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,711
You're so cruel!

552
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,912
Cruel, me?

553
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,473
How could you!

554
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,358
It's your baby

555
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,355
I'm carrying in my womb.

556
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,635
And you still want

557
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,514
other men to look at me
and desire me.

558
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,793
That's terrible!

559
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,796
Don't get so angry about it!

560
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:24,109
I thought if I beat up some idiot,
you'd feel better.

561
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,478
Didn't I already tell you yesterday?

562
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:38,992
I feel

563
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,596
like I'm an alien.

564
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:48,037
I don't want to do it, full stop!

565
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,636
Alright, calm down.

566
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,677
You don't understand.

567
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:06,479
I'm going.

568
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,360
See you tomorrow.

569
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,472
We'll talk then.

570
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,394
Maybe that's better.

571
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,318
Will you be at home?

572
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,273
Good evening.

573
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:33,358
Do you want a lift?

574
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,555
Get in, I'll take you home.

575
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:39,193
Are you hesitant today?

576
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:43,349
You'll tell me to go straight home?

577
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:44,675
No.

578
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,718
What was crying yourself
to sleep like?

579
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,989
It worked. I woke up happier.

580
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,519
Good.

581
01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:01,594
Tonight I want to drink
so I'll feel even happier!

582
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,676
Good! The drinks are on me!

583
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,952
I don't even know your name!

584
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,278
My name's Horio.

585
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,479
I'm a hundred times happier!

586
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,558
You look tired.

587
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,592
A bit.

588
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,715
It's late. Do you want to go home?

589
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,318
I'll call you a cab.

590
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,031
I'm staying a while longer.

591
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,228
You can stay.

592
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,473
Or you can go...

593
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:02,031
What would you rather do?

594
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:11,350
To be honest, I'd rather you stayed.

595
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:29,870
I'll call my boyfriend
and ask him if it's alright.

596
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:55,473
Hello?

597
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,272
Is that you, lady?

598
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,118
It's me.

599
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:04,313
Can I see you tomorrow?

600
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:09,311
I don't see why I should see you.

601
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:25,156
Why can't you be nicer to me?

602
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:30,912
Be sweet or
it will all be over between us.

603
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,834
Please, honey. Be sweet.

604
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,436
I need a loan.

605
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,073
What for?

606
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:48,792
To pay for an abortion.

607
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:51,919
Never.

608
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,073
What are you doing?

609
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:02,478
This is for services rendered.

610
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,794
You've got a nerve,

611
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:11,912
taking my money to give it
to some girl you got pregnant!

612
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,556
I can imagine how you reacted

613
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:19,229
when she told you
she was in trouble!

614
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:23,517
You wouldn't understand!
You don't have a clue.

615
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:28,316
You're wrong! I once aborted
a child that was yours!

616
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,191
I was sure it was yours.

617
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:34,391
You've never told me.

618
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:39,515
I didn't want to be humiliated
by you treating me badly.

619
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:46,751
So I thought I'd be better off
sorting it out by myself.

620
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:55,275
But this girl's hopeless.
She's not strong like me.

621
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:03,232
Now, you'll just hurt each other.
I feel sorry for you.

622
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:04,714
Shut up!

623
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:07,913
Why did you come here?

624
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,594
Here.

625
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,158
For the doctor.

626
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:22,033
This is the clinic's address.

627
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:27,552
You can go anytime before 8.
Go tonight, if you want.

628
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,830
Be honest!
I'm not the only one to blame!

629
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:39,154
There's no need to worry.

630
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:44,275
I slept with another man last night.

631
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,153
Really?

632
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:49,679
Of course.

633
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,397
Why did you do it?

634
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,515
Why?

635
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:30,551
I don't know,
maybe to get over my sadness.

636
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,470
You're so cruel.

637
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:41,072
I thought an older man
might be kinder.

638
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,673
Who is he?

639
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:46,713
His name's Horio.

640
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:51,796
The guy that got away
the other night.

641
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,150
He was a good man,

642
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,512
so kind.

643
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,830
But I keep thinking of you.

644
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,478
It's irritating, but it's the truth.

645
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,711
But I can forget now.

646
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:28,149
I can get rid of the baby.

647
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,875
Are you Mr. Horio?

648
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,479
Who are you?

649
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:21,511
It's about last night.

650
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:29,309
How about paying for the girl?

651
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,158
What relationship do you have?

652
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:34,193
Don't you think you should pay?

653
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:37,073
So you set me up then?

654
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:42,473
Why else would she
have gone with you?

655
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:52,517
- The poor girl was crying.
- She was pretending.

656
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:55,870
Because of you?

657
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,274
Shut up!

658
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,348
Will you have a drink with me?

659
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:18,711
I'm hungry, I'd rather go and eat.

660
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,597
No, please!

661
01:10:56,400 --> 01:11:00,552
Is it you again?
Want to have fun with my wife?

662
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:04,474
I should make you pay.

663
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:07,957
You tried to betray me, didn't you?

664
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:11,838
Didn't you know he's no good?

665
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:14,469
You animal!

666
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:31,439
Doctor.

667
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:46,031
Sorry about the time.

668
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:47,514
Come in.

669
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:54,953
- What's going on?
- Aren't you busy?

670
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:59,196
I just finished a minor operation.

671
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:04,516
How about a drink
for old times?

672
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:25,593
To our youth.

673
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:35,916
I'd love to have it back!

674
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:38,388
What?

675
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,750
I've split with my lover.

676
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,637
I want to start again.

677
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:53,876
My sister is just like I was.

678
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:57,550
She's rebelling against the world!

679
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:01,114
I want to be like that again!

680
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,476
Is there anything I can do?

681
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:09,754
If it can't be love...

682
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:13,474
Maybe a job or something else.

683
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:19,759
You're the only one
who can give me a chance.

684
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:39,358
Doctor, that patient...

685
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,077
What's going on?

686
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:45,158
Mako had an abortion here.

687
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,831
Why are you here?

688
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:54,396
She's an ex-lover of mine.

689
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,390
My patients rarely pay me.

690
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:07,071
So I have to do other jobs.

691
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,031
She's sleeping.

692
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,311
Leave us alone.

693
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:34,437
How cynical!

694
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:38,952
We tried to conquer the world...

695
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,675
We were both so determined.
What was the result?

696
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,954
We couldn't do anything about it.

697
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,470
This is a cruel world
and it destroyed our love.

698
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:04,319
At least our love remained
pure and chaste.

699
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:11,074
We vented our anger
with the student demonstrations.

700
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,999
But it was all pointless.

701
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:21,070
We got hurt and we split up.

702
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,799
We had to accept defeat.

703
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,392
Your sister,

704
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,118
on the other hand,

705
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:38,199
fights giving in to all her desires.

706
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:42,237
But she won't be able to win.

707
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:45,439
In the end,

708
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:49,392
her failures, like this abortion,

709
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:54,153
will cost her...

710
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:57,112
No, never!

711
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:05,399
The poor girl looked desperate
when she arrived.

712
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:10,196
You're wrong!
We're not much different from you!

713
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,874
I wish that were the case.

714
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,069
No!

715
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:19,478
Don't destroy my last hope!

716
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:23,793
Or you'll destroy theirs too.

717
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:30,598
We have no dreams,
that's why we'll never be like you!

718
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,834
Are you so sure?

719
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:35,359
Of course!

720
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:38,798
I'd better go.

721
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:41,915
There's no rush.

722
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:49,073
We were beaten again tonight.
Let's have a drink.

723
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:56,158
We needn't see each other again.
Let's spend the night together!

724
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:59,594
Stop being naive!

725
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:03,997
Yuki... this girl...

726
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,239
it's like she's my wife.

727
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:16,434
I'm tied to her
for the rest of my life!

728
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,638
Goodbye.

729
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,795
Take care of her.

730
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,152
Did you come for me?

731
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:31,915
Did you stay all night?

732
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:53,158
I must be kind occasionally.
I don't want you to cheat on me.

733
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:57,999
Stupid.

734
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:13,878
How are you feeling?

735
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:19,755
Still very confused.

736
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:23,551
You'll be fine.

737
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,795
Let's go on a trip.

738
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:34,956
Have you got any money?

739
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:42,791
It reminds me
of that time on the boat.

740
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:47,669
You were horrible at first.

741
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:53,394
You'd get angry with me
for all sorts of reasons.

742
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:02,632
But later,
you were very sweet to me.

743
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:07,673
Now you vent your anger
on the guys you rip off.

744
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:10,432
I'm going to stop doing it.

745
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:12,469
Why?

746
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:15,355
You don't like it.

747
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:17,391
- Is that why?
- Yes.

748
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,037
I admit I enjoy the thrill,

749
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:27,637
but it makes me feel evil.

750
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:32,555
I hated being used like that.

751
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:36,069
It's because of those stupid men.

752
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:42,399
Men are always chasing women,
aren't they?

753
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,514
You'll protect me, won't you?

754
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,153
Don't worry.

755
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:56,431
Aren't you angry with me?

756
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:58,999
No.

757
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:01,117
You're so sweet!

758
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:38,394
Fujii? Miss Shinjo?

759
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:42,070
You're both wanted for extortion.

760
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:02,834
I know Mr. Horio...

761
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:06,870
But I don't know him well.

762
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:11,517
But Fujii beat him up
and said it was about a set-up.

763
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:17,598
Is that so?

764
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:25,876
There are so many idiots around!

765
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,675
Do you admit you were wrong?

766
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:33,872
No!
Aren't these guys to be blamed?

767
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:37,559
Who attract girls
with their cars and money?

768
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:41,719
I have to admit
you're right about that.

769
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:46,753
But someone needs to be in charge.

770
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:51,350
I heard you used force
for no reason.

771
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,675
You took some money...

772
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:03,070
and spent it having fun.

773
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:11,750
Apart from your theories, the fact is
that you like money.

774
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:18,235
Money buys clothes, food
and even abortions!

775
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:22,871
Just like your victims,
you covet money!

776
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:27,392
You're just like them,
you're a victim of money too!

777
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:35,475
You always think about
hurting people.

778
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:44,555
Stop denying it!

779
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:48,159
Isn't it time you confessed?

780
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:50,673
One visit.

781
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:28,398
It's you, brother!

782
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:32,115
You idiot! That serves you right!

783
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:39,950
My husband is doing
business with Horio.

784
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:45,438
I asked him to put in
a good word for you.

785
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:48,871
So act like you're sorry.

786
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:53,558
If you apologize,
Horio won't press charges.

787
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:57,630
You just need to say sorry.

788
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:04,189
I'm sorry I didn't look after him.

789
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:09,358
He can stay with me for a while.

790
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:11,630
Thanks.

791
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:30,473
Thanks for telling the whole story!

792
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,789
Anyhow, I don't hate you.

793
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:40,154
We're just as guilty as you.

794
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:41,998
One moment!

795
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:46,956
Isn't she with you this time?

796
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:48,513
Get in!

797
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:03,796
Your girlfriend's staying in.

798
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,389
She'll go to a reform school.

799
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:11,470
So it's all over then.

800
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:18,069
Why do you keep bothering me?

801
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:23,640
Don't forget that I got you
out of there.

802
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:31,994
You admitted you were wrong.

803
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:36,308
That makes a nice change from
your usual behavior!

804
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:39,031
I lied to him!

805
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,275
Otherwise they wouldn't
have let me go.

806
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:45,438
I don't think I was wrong!

807
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:50,036
Where will you go?

808
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:52,913
You should know. Goodbye!

809
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:08,398
- Why don't you let me in?
- Let's go.

810
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:24,310
- I can't today.
- Why?

811
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:35,195
Where are you going?
I'll take you!

812
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:37,038
No way.

813
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,317
Is she your ex-lover?

814
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:48,149
She got me out of prison.

815
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:50,828
But I didn't ask her to do it.

816
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:07,989
- What is she to you now?
- Nothing!

817
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:33,948
I don't like her.
I was ready to start again.

818
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:40,636
She's still following us!

819
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,433
Lose her.

820
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:03,669
- Good!
- I don't have a cent!

821
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:07,193
Don't you?

822
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:10,552
What a great idea!

823
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:16,034
- What's going on?
- They don't have any money!

824
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:17,992
- How much is it?
- 360 yen.

825
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:24,990
I'll let you go for today. Call me.

826
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:40,758
What shall we do?

827
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:42,833
I don't know.

828
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:51,033
- Any ideas?
- None.

829
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:00,077
What do you think
about the set-up we did?

830
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:05,310
I told the policemen
I didn't think we were wrong!

831
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:09,474
Mako... forget it.

832
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,478
What are you saying?

833
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:14,911
I think it's for the best.

834
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:19,229
Don't get inhibited by an arrest.

835
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:25,272
Remember when you asked me
to protect you?

836
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:29,356
I can't protect you.

837
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:32,191
Don't say that.

838
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:39,755
You said that's what women are like.

839
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:46,229
Men are no different.

840
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:52,795
We don't sell ourselves
in order to live.

841
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:58,188
That's what the world is like.

842
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:01,471
But together, we...

843
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,878
Together or alone,
it's the same thing.

844
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:08,396
We just hurt each other.

845
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:16,029
It'll probably be a failure,
so why not try by ourselves?

846
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:19,879
No.

847
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:25,955
Even if we get back together again,
it won't be the same thing.

848
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:29,718
Goodbye.

849
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:31,755
No!

850
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:40,353
Do you love me?

851
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:42,759
I love you.

852
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:46,039
No!

853
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:52,553
Wait.

854
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:55,028
Why?

855
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:14,674
I was looking for you.

856
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:18,914
You've got us into a real mess.

857
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:24,956
Remember that motorbike?
It was stolen!

858
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:28,114
So those two got arrested!

859
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:33,637
You'll sort everything out,
obviously.

860
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:40,317
If you don't have cash, how about
lending us your girlfriend?

861
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:43,360
I heard you had fun.

862
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:45,753
I won't give her to you!

863
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:49,234
Be careful!

864
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:03,152
What's wrong? Don't you feel well?

865
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:07,236
Where do you live?
I'll take you home.

866
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:35,110
How come you're so quiet?

867
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:39,875
Give us the girl.

868
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:44,633
Never!

869
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:58,073
How about we rest here
for a while?

870
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:00,637
No, let me out.

871
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:09,079
Let me out!

872
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:10,633
Not yet, kid!

873
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:36,155
