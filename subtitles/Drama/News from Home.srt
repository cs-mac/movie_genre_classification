1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,702
Do you know she's...

2
00:00:04,203 --> 00:00:06,205
saving a room for her mother?

3
00:00:06,205 --> 00:00:07,706
Did she tell
you that?

4
00:00:07,706 --> 00:00:09,208
(softly):
Yeah.

5
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:11,210
Is she strange, that's all?

6
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,212
Is she okay?
If-if you had to take a guess.

7
00:00:15,214 --> 00:00:19,218
That little girl's
the only friend my son ever had.

8
00:00:19,218 --> 00:00:21,720
So she's strange, you bet.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,722
BUNNY:
It crashed!

10
00:00:26,225 --> 00:00:30,229
(kids laughing)

11
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:34,233
All right.

12
00:00:34,233 --> 00:00:36,235
There you go.

13
00:00:40,656 --> 00:00:43,158
(seagulls calling)

14
00:00:47,663 --> 00:00:49,164
(labored breathing)

15
00:00:57,172 --> 00:01:01,176
Do you know
how he died?

16
00:01:01,176 --> 00:01:03,178
My husband?

17
00:01:08,183 --> 00:01:12,187
It was a calm night
when Herold took the boat out.

18
00:01:12,187 --> 00:01:17,192
There was no sign
of any storm.

19
00:01:17,192 --> 00:01:19,695
Storms can be sudden
around here.

20
00:01:19,695 --> 00:01:23,198
He wasn't the only one
whose boat went down.

21
00:01:27,703 --> 00:01:31,206
It was four years ago...

22
00:01:31,206 --> 00:01:33,208
and it's yesterday.

23
00:01:47,723 --> 00:01:48,724
HERRY:
Look how high
we're up.

24
00:01:48,724 --> 00:01:50,225
BUNNY:
Uh-huh.

25
00:01:50,225 --> 00:01:53,228
Beat you to
the car.

26
00:01:53,228 --> 00:01:55,230
(kids laughing)

27
00:01:57,232 --> 00:01:58,734
Did I blow it

28
00:01:58,734 --> 00:02:00,736
or can you still
be my friend?

29
00:02:02,738 --> 00:02:07,242
Your friend? Sure.

30
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:33,268
(Bunny humming)

31
00:02:39,775 --> 00:02:41,777
Is this yours?

32
00:02:42,778 --> 00:02:46,281
(yawning):
The ghost brought it.

33
00:02:47,282 --> 00:02:49,284
Then he ran away.

34
00:02:49,284 --> 00:02:51,787
The skinny ghost
with the white dog?

35
00:02:51,787 --> 00:02:55,290
Don't say I dreamt it.

36
00:03:02,798 --> 00:03:04,299
(sighs)

37
00:03:07,803 --> 00:03:09,805
BILLY:
Ah, you're getting
the hang of it.

38
00:03:09,805 --> 00:03:11,807
Now, coax her a wee bit
to starboard.

39
00:03:11,807 --> 00:03:15,310
Attaboy. You're a Quoyle--
there's seawater in your veins.

40
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,812
(groaning)

41
00:03:16,812 --> 00:03:19,815
How are things
with your girl?

42
00:03:19,815 --> 00:03:24,319
Oh, Bunny's just still
adjusting, I think.

43
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,322
Oh, I was talking
about Wavey Prowse.

44
00:03:27,322 --> 00:03:28,323
Sorry... sorry!

45
00:03:28,323 --> 00:03:29,324
Whoa!

46
00:03:29,324 --> 00:03:31,326
Jesus!
Sorry.

47
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:34,329
I... Wavey and I
are just friends.

48
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:37,833
Fine. Don't have
to drown me over it.

49
00:03:46,842 --> 00:03:49,845
This is where
I grew up.

50
00:03:49,845 --> 00:03:51,847
That's my poor old
father there.

51
00:03:57,352 --> 00:03:59,354
And that's where
your house stood.

52
00:04:09,364 --> 00:04:11,867
Before they dragged it
across the ice.

53
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:12,868
Yes, sir.

54
00:04:12,868 --> 00:04:15,871
Before they was driven away.

55
00:04:18,373 --> 00:04:19,875
Driven away by what?

56
00:04:22,878 --> 00:04:24,880
You never knew?

57
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,882
Ah, well.

58
00:04:26,882 --> 00:04:28,383
It's neither
here nor there, right?

59
00:04:28,383 --> 00:04:30,385
The point is, they made
a new place for theirselves.

60
00:04:30,385 --> 00:04:31,887
No, by what?
Driven away by what?

61
00:04:31,887 --> 00:04:34,890
Oh, that's old stuff, boy.

62
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,391
It's in my blood.

63
00:04:36,391 --> 00:04:38,894
You ought to be
able to tell me.

64
00:04:40,896 --> 00:04:45,400
Well, they come to Gaze Island
centuries ago, they did.

65
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,402
The old Quoyles was rackers.

66
00:04:47,402 --> 00:04:50,405
They were, they were pirates,
sort of like.

67
00:04:50,405 --> 00:04:51,406
You see them cairns?

68
00:04:53,408 --> 00:04:55,410
Fires used to burn
in them

69
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,414
to guide
the ships at sea
like lighthouses.

70
00:04:59,414 --> 00:05:02,417
Now, the Quoyles
would move the fires

71
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:03,919
to fool the ships.

72
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,921
They'd lure them
into the rocks

73
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:07,923
so the Quoyles could grab
their loot.

74
00:05:07,923 --> 00:05:10,425
Oh, they was a savage lot,
the old Quoyles.

75
00:05:10,425 --> 00:05:15,430
Then they went too far one day,
they... nailed a man to a tree

76
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,432
and they cut
off his nose

77
00:05:17,432 --> 00:05:20,435
to draw the nippers
and the flies

78
00:05:20,435 --> 00:05:22,437
that-that ate him alive.

79
00:05:22,437 --> 00:05:26,942
And that's when the Quoyles was
given their walking papers.

80
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:29,444
Jesus.

81
00:05:29,945 --> 00:05:31,446
Now, there's still an old Quoyle

82
00:05:31,446 --> 00:05:33,949
down in one of these coves
somewhere.

83
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:37,452
They say he slept with his wife
after she was dead.

84
00:05:37,452 --> 00:05:41,456
Anything else I should know?

85
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,961
That about covers it.

86
00:05:48,463 --> 00:05:50,966
(buoy bell ringing)

87
00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:58,473
BILLY:
? When the knitting pins,
you is abreast ?

88
00:05:58,473 --> 00:06:02,978
? Hold the tiller
to the west... ?

89
00:06:02,978 --> 00:06:08,483
? Behind the pins
you must steer... ?

90
00:06:08,483 --> 00:06:11,486
? Till the old man's shoe...
does appear. ?

91
00:06:11,486 --> 00:06:13,989
(Celtic drums fade up)

92
00:06:13,989 --> 00:06:15,991
(woman screaming)

93
00:06:21,496 --> 00:06:23,498
(men yelling)

94
00:06:30,505 --> 00:06:34,009
(men shouting indistinctly)

95
00:06:39,514 --> 00:06:41,516
MAN:
Pull, pull!

96
00:06:43,018 --> 00:06:45,020
(shouting angrily)

97
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:52,027
(drums stop)

98
00:06:52,527 --> 00:06:54,529
(gasps)

99
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:05,040
AGNIS:
Show me that necklace.

100
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,042
See, if you make
the loops bigger

101
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:08,543
you don't have
to make so many.

102
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,544
BUNNY:
Okay.

103
00:07:09,544 --> 00:07:12,547
Good morning.

104
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,552
Can I talk to you for a minute?

105
00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:25,560
Where's that chair from?

106
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,063
Excuse me?

107
00:07:28,063 --> 00:07:29,564
The chair
that you're sitting in.

108
00:07:29,564 --> 00:07:31,566
Where's it from;
where'd you get it?

109
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:33,068
It's not from
around here, right?

110
00:07:33,068 --> 00:07:36,571
It's foreign,
it's exotic.

111
00:07:36,571 --> 00:07:39,074
I don't want pirate's loot
in this home.

112
00:07:39,074 --> 00:07:42,577
Billy Pretty told me
all about it.

113
00:07:43,078 --> 00:07:47,082
It's a good thing
somebody finally did.

114
00:07:47,082 --> 00:07:50,085
I don't believe in dwelling
in the past.

115
00:07:50,585 --> 00:07:53,088
No? Then what
are we doing here?

116
00:07:53,088 --> 00:07:55,090
Making a future.

117
00:08:00,095 --> 00:08:01,096
Well, well, well

118
00:08:01,096 --> 00:08:04,599
if it ain't the second coming
of the Quoyles.

119
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:06,601
Taking a long
and hearty meal break

120
00:08:06,601 --> 00:08:08,603
I can't help but noticing.

121
00:08:08,603 --> 00:08:10,605
Hope you've got a good idea
for your next story, Quoyle.

122
00:08:10,605 --> 00:08:11,606
I'd hate for Jack to think

123
00:08:11,606 --> 00:08:13,108
that it was just
beginner's luck.

124
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:14,609
Let the man digest, Tert.

125
00:08:14,609 --> 00:08:16,611
Mind you,
if I was the esteemed author

126
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:18,613
of the "Shipping News" column

127
00:08:18,613 --> 00:08:21,116
I'd pick up
the McGonigle oil field story.

128
00:08:21,116 --> 00:08:23,118
Petro-dollars;
a golden flood of jobs.

129
00:08:23,118 --> 00:08:24,619
You write a story
about that

130
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:27,122
I'll put it right there
on the front page.

131
00:08:27,122 --> 00:08:29,124
Thank you
for stopping by, Tert.

132
00:08:29,124 --> 00:08:31,126
Yeah, thanks, Tert.

133
00:08:33,628 --> 00:08:35,130
Aw, gee...

134
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,133
What was that
all about?

135
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:41,636
Oh, uh, he owns Mobil Oil.

136
00:08:41,636 --> 00:08:44,139
Ten shares.

137
00:08:46,141 --> 00:08:47,642
WAVEY:
What about your column?

138
00:08:47,642 --> 00:08:50,145
What about it?

139
00:08:50,145 --> 00:08:52,147
You said you'd
read it to me.

140
00:08:52,147 --> 00:08:54,649
Yeah, I will,
once the game is done.

141
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:58,153
(horn blowing)

142
00:09:01,656 --> 00:09:05,160
"There's a 1904 photo hung
in the Killick-Claw library...

143
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,663
"eight schooners heading out
to the fishing grounds

144

145

as likely to see

"Nobody hangs a picture

155
00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:47,202
What do you think?

156
00:09:47,202 --> 00:09:51,706
I think when Tert Card sees it,
he'll stay up nights

157
00:09:51,706 --> 00:09:55,210
thinking of cheap shots
to pay you back.

158
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,712
I think he won't stop
until you're fired.

159
00:10:00,715 --> 00:10:06,721
I think I haven't been so proud
of a friend...

160
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:09,724
since I don't know when.

(door squeaking)

164
00:10:26,241 --> 00:10:27,742
Uh, what do you think?

165
00:10:27,742 --> 00:10:29,744
Pretty impressive, huh?

166
00:10:29,744 --> 00:10:32,747
Like I said, nobody
hangs one of those.

167
00:10:32,747 --> 00:10:35,250
Well... your column's
front page stuff.

168
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,754
Only now it's more
a caption, is all.

169
00:10:39,754 --> 00:10:42,257
"More than 3,000 tankers
proudly ride...

170
00:10:42,257 --> 00:10:43,758
the world's seas."

171
00:10:43,758 --> 00:10:46,261
"Even the biggest
take advantage

172
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:49,264
of Newfoundland's deep water
ports and refineries."

173
00:10:49,264 --> 00:10:52,767
Spelled it all perfect
so as not to embarrass you.

174
00:10:53,268 --> 00:10:55,270
"Oil and Newfoundland
go together

175
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,271
"like ham and eggs

176
00:10:56,771 --> 00:11:00,275
and like ham and eggs, they'll
nourish us in the coming years."

177
00:11:00,275 --> 00:11:04,279
Even put
your name on it.

178
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:09,284
"Let's all hang a picture
of an oil tanker on our wall."

179
00:11:09,284 --> 00:11:12,787
Man of your principles...

180
00:11:12,787 --> 00:11:17,292
I understand
the only honorable
course is resignation.

181
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:18,793
(crumples paper)

182
00:11:18,793 --> 00:11:21,296
And if you're off
to see Jack Buggit

183
00:11:21,296 --> 00:11:23,298
you're going
to have to swim.

184
00:11:23,798 --> 00:11:26,301
For I runs theGammy Bird,
every inch of it--

185
00:11:26,301 --> 00:11:27,802
which he'd have
to do without me.

186
00:11:27,802 --> 00:11:30,305
And if you think he's going
to choose you over fishing

187
00:11:30,305 --> 00:11:33,808
then you're dumber
than a doughnut.

188
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:37,312
If that's possible.

189
00:12:03,338 --> 00:12:04,839
Jack?

190
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:05,840
For Christ
sakes, Quoyle

191
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,343
cut your motor!

192
00:12:20,855 --> 00:12:24,359
All right,
what's the emergency?

193
00:12:24,859 --> 00:12:26,361
Can't it wait
till I'm done fishing?

194
00:12:26,361 --> 00:12:27,862
It's about my column.

195
00:12:27,862 --> 00:12:31,866
Card, he printed it
not the way I wrote it.

196
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:32,867
Well, so?

197
00:12:32,867 --> 00:12:36,871
You disapprove
how Card runs my newspaper

198
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:41,376
enough to lose your job?

199
00:12:41,376 --> 00:12:44,379
Yes or no?

200
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:46,881
Yes.

201
00:12:49,884 --> 00:12:51,886
(shortwave radio
playing quietly)

202
00:13:01,896 --> 00:13:03,398
(door opens)

203
00:13:07,902 --> 00:13:11,406
So, this is what
Jack and I think:

204
00:13:11,906 --> 00:13:14,909
we want to run Quoyle's
wrong-headed oil spills story

205
00:13:14,909 --> 00:13:17,412
because controversy sells papers

206
00:13:17,412 --> 00:13:19,414
and papers sells ads.

207
00:13:23,418 --> 00:13:25,920
But the oil tanker picture
stays.

208
00:13:29,424 --> 00:13:31,926
(groans)

209
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:36,931
(laughter)

210
00:13:36,931 --> 00:13:38,933
You should have seen
Tert's face.

211
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:39,934
Yeah?

212
00:13:40,435 --> 00:13:41,936
Oh, it was
a beautiful thing.

213
00:13:41,936 --> 00:13:43,438
That's all right,
I've seen it.

214
00:13:43,438 --> 00:13:44,439
(chuckles)

215
00:13:46,941 --> 00:13:49,444
Oh, it's great.
Mm-hmm.

216
00:13:51,946 --> 00:13:52,947
Let's see
what the special is.

217
00:14:01,456 --> 00:14:04,959
How do you feel
about ordering to go?

218
00:14:08,463 --> 00:14:09,964
You ever had that
before?

219
00:14:09,964 --> 00:14:12,467
No, what is it?

220
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:14,969
Seal-flipper pie.

221
00:14:14,969 --> 00:14:16,971
Yeah, it's made
from, like

222
00:14:16,971 --> 00:14:19,974
the knuckle part
of the flipper.

223
00:14:19,974 --> 00:14:21,976
The slimy cartilage part.

224
00:14:23,978 --> 00:14:25,980
Yeah, it's good, though.

225
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,482
I mean, it's
a good choice

226
00:14:27,482 --> 00:14:29,484
if you like
that sort of thing.

227
00:14:29,484 --> 00:14:32,487
I... you know,
I'm really not
all that hungry.

228
00:14:32,487 --> 00:14:34,989
I just wanted, you know,
to come and sit.

229
00:14:34,989 --> 00:14:37,492
I had a big lunch today.

230
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:38,993
Yeah.

231
00:14:38,993 --> 00:14:41,496
They say you're not
a real Newfoundlander

232
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:43,998
till you've had a piece
of seal-flipper pie.

233
00:14:47,502 --> 00:14:49,003
That's what they say?

234
00:14:49,003 --> 00:14:50,004
Yeah, that's right.

235
00:14:59,013 --> 00:15:02,016
Mmm, good.
That's surprising.

236
00:15:02,016 --> 00:15:05,019
(laughs):
I never eat it, myself.

237
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:07,522
You never eat this?

238
00:15:07,522 --> 00:15:11,025
This is horrible.

239
00:15:11,025 --> 00:15:14,028
Here, I got you some
real food-- look.

240
00:15:14,028 --> 00:15:16,030
(both laughing)

241
00:15:18,032 --> 00:15:21,035
(lilting melody playing)

242
00:15:50,064 --> 00:15:51,566
(engine revs)

243
00:15:54,569 --> 00:15:56,571
(gasps)

244
00:16:01,075 --> 00:16:03,077
(grunting and gasping)

245
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,586
(gasping)

246
00:16:11,586 --> 00:16:14,088
(motor clanks dully)

247
00:16:14,088 --> 00:16:15,089
(yells in pain)

248
00:16:30,104 --> 00:16:32,106
(gasping)

249
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:54,629
(gasping)

250
00:17:13,147 --> 00:17:16,150
(melancholy music playing)

251
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:37,672
(music continues)

252
00:17:40,174 --> 00:17:43,177
(buoy bell clangs
in distance)

253
00:17:43,177 --> 00:17:45,680
(motor chugging)

254
00:17:55,189 --> 00:17:57,191
(motor throttles back)

255
00:18:01,696 --> 00:18:03,197
JACK:
Christ.

256
00:18:03,197 --> 00:18:05,700
I knew somebody
was out here.

257
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,201
(groans)

258
00:18:15,209 --> 00:18:16,711
Oh, for Christ's sake.

259
00:18:22,216 --> 00:18:25,219
(shuddering)

260
00:18:36,731 --> 00:18:40,234
He's still burning off
the fever.

261
00:18:54,749 --> 00:18:56,751
Any feeling yet?

262
00:18:58,753 --> 00:19:00,755
Little tingles.

263
00:19:03,257 --> 00:19:04,759
You're lucky.

264
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:05,760
I'm fine.

265
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,764
I'll be ready to get
right back in that water

266
00:19:09,764 --> 00:19:12,767
in another 20, 30 years.

267
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:16,270
Do you know how close
you were to dying?

268
00:19:21,275 --> 00:19:24,779
I'll get my uncle, Alvin Yark,
to build you a proper boat

269
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:26,781
and learn how to use it, okay?

270
00:19:26,781 --> 00:19:30,284
Okay.

271
00:19:30,284 --> 00:19:32,286
Good.

272
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,302
MAVIS:
Were the eyes open or closed?

273
00:19:48,302 --> 00:19:49,804
I don't know.

274
00:19:49,804 --> 00:19:52,807
Just said it was
an disembodied head.

275
00:19:52,807 --> 00:19:53,808
What'd the police have

276
00:19:53,808 --> 00:19:55,309
to say about it?

277
00:19:55,309 --> 00:19:56,310
Still working on it.

278
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:59,814
A little late to return the head
to its owner, though.

279
00:19:59,814 --> 00:20:01,816
(snorts)

280
00:20:01,816 --> 00:20:05,820
Hello, nephew.

281
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,821
Police bulletin:

282
00:20:06,821 --> 00:20:10,825
"Mrs. Silver Melville
was arrested early today

283
00:20:10,825 --> 00:20:13,828
"in Lanai, Hawaii,
for the murder of her husband

284
00:20:13,828 --> 00:20:18,332
socialite and raconteur
Mr. Bayonet Melville."

285
00:20:18,332 --> 00:20:21,335
'He pushed me once too often,'
Mrs. Melville confessed

286
00:20:21,335 --> 00:20:23,337
'so I finally pushed back.'"

287
00:20:23,337 --> 00:20:25,840
Good for you, my dear.

288
00:20:30,344 --> 00:20:32,346
Well, he probably
deserved it.

289
00:20:44,358 --> 00:20:46,360
Hey.
Hey.

290
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,862
Don't get your hopes up.

291
00:20:47,862 --> 00:20:50,364
You're the first man
who ever cooked for me.

292
00:20:50,364 --> 00:20:51,365
You got a lot
of leeway.

293
00:20:51,866 --> 00:20:52,867
How are they?

294
00:20:52,867 --> 00:20:56,871
They're both asleep
in Bunny's bed.

295
00:20:56,871 --> 00:20:59,874
Should we trust them?

296
00:20:59,874 --> 00:21:01,876
(laughing)
I can do this.
You just don't think...

297
00:21:02,376 --> 00:21:03,377
Oh, no.

298
00:21:03,377 --> 00:21:05,880
No, I know. Here...

299
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,382
let me do that,
all right?

300
00:21:10,885 --> 00:21:12,386
There you go.

301
00:21:15,389 --> 00:21:17,391
Can you feel that...
Yeah.

302
00:21:17,391 --> 00:21:19,393
through your bandage?

303
00:21:41,916 --> 00:21:44,418
What?

304
00:21:49,423 --> 00:21:51,926
Your husband, he never...

305
00:21:51,926 --> 00:21:53,928
he never cooked you a meal?

306
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,932
Why are we talking
about my husband?

307
00:22:00,434 --> 00:22:02,937
Because I understand.

308
00:22:02,937 --> 00:22:07,441
You said "It's four years
ago and it's yesterday."

309
00:22:07,441 --> 00:22:09,443
(heavy sigh)

310
00:22:09,443 --> 00:22:12,947
I understand that.

311
00:22:12,947 --> 00:22:16,951
My husband's not who
we're talking about, right?

312
00:22:28,462 --> 00:22:29,463
I'll go get Herry.

313
00:22:29,463 --> 00:22:32,466
He wouldn't like
waking up in a strange bed.

314
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,481
(dog barks)

315
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:58,993
(mysterious theme playing)

316
00:23:10,004 --> 00:23:13,507
(wind whistling eerily)

317
00:23:13,507 --> 00:23:17,011
(rattling and creaking)

318
00:23:17,011 --> 00:23:19,013
(mysterious theme continues)

319
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:36,530
Hey!
Huh?!

320
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,531
Who are you?

321
00:23:37,531 --> 00:23:39,033
(barking)

322
00:23:39,033 --> 00:23:41,035
(growling)

323
00:23:41,035 --> 00:23:42,036
(barking)

324
00:23:42,036 --> 00:23:43,037
(muttering)

325
00:23:43,037 --> 00:23:46,040
I tied magic in these knots

326
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,542
to protect you
from the house.

327
00:23:48,542 --> 00:23:50,544
No good ever come
from the old place.

328
00:23:50,544 --> 00:23:53,047
Never, never... never.

329
00:23:53,047 --> 00:23:57,051
You... you have no...

330
00:23:57,051 --> 00:24:00,054
business in the
Quoyle house.

331
00:24:00,054 --> 00:24:02,056
I get you
out of there.

332
00:24:02,056 --> 00:24:03,557
But I am a Quoyle.

333
00:24:03,557 --> 00:24:06,060
A Quoyle?!

334
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:09,063
I was a Quoyle
before you was anything.

335
00:24:09,563 --> 00:24:11,065
(clearing throat)

336
00:24:11,065 --> 00:24:13,067
Leave the house.

337
00:24:15,069 --> 00:24:18,072
Tell, uh...
Agnis hello from...

338
00:24:18,072 --> 00:24:20,574
Cousin Nolan.

339
00:24:20,574 --> 00:24:22,576
(muttering)

340
00:24:22,576 --> 00:24:26,080
You know why
Agnis come back?

341
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,085
To show she ain't afraid
of the place no more.

342
00:24:31,085 --> 00:24:35,089
'Cause I know what she's done.
I know.

343
00:24:35,089 --> 00:24:37,591
She got rid of the baby
she was carrying.

344
00:24:37,591 --> 00:24:40,094
What could she do? What?

345
00:24:40,094 --> 00:24:44,598
She was only 12

346
00:24:44,598 --> 00:24:50,104
and it was her own brother
that done it to her.

347
00:24:57,611 --> 00:24:59,113
(girl laughing)

348
00:25:04,618 --> 00:25:06,120
(laughs)

349
00:25:13,127 --> 00:25:14,628
(laughs)

350
00:25:20,134 --> 00:25:23,137
No...

351
00:25:23,137 --> 00:25:25,139
No! No! No!

352
00:25:25,139 --> 00:25:27,141
Please! No!

353
00:25:27,141 --> 00:25:29,143
No! Please!

354
00:25:29,143 --> 00:25:30,644
(shrieks)

355
00:25:43,157 --> 00:25:44,158
(kettle whistles)

356
00:25:54,168 --> 00:25:56,670
Does that belong
to you?

357
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,672
Sorry.

358
00:26:02,176 --> 00:26:03,677
There's still hot water
in the kettle

359
00:26:03,677 --> 00:26:05,679
if you want some tea.

360
00:26:08,182 --> 00:26:11,685
I've started looking
for a place for me
and Bunny.

361
00:26:11,685 --> 00:26:14,688
You sure you're going
to be okay at your shop?

362
00:26:14,688 --> 00:26:17,191
I said I would,
didn't I?

363
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,702
I think
Silver Melville was right

364
00:26:28,702 --> 00:26:30,204
to chop her husband's head off.

365
00:26:32,206 --> 00:26:35,709
He probably deserved it.

366
00:26:43,717 --> 00:26:47,221
I think more women
should do what she did.

367
00:26:50,224 --> 00:26:53,727
Maybe some should have done it
to their own brother...

368
00:26:58,232 --> 00:27:00,234
my father.

369
00:27:03,237 --> 00:27:06,240
Cousin Nolan dropped by
last night.

370
00:27:24,258 --> 00:27:25,759
(dishes clatter)

371
00:27:38,772 --> 00:27:43,277
I always thought if anyone
knew, I'd be turned to stone.

372
00:27:43,277 --> 00:27:46,780
Shit!

373
00:28:03,297 --> 00:28:04,798
Here.

374
00:28:08,302 --> 00:28:10,304
Tea's a good drink.

375
00:28:10,304 --> 00:28:12,306
It'll keep you going.

376
00:28:21,815 --> 00:28:24,818
When someone hurts you
that much...

377
00:28:24,818 --> 00:28:26,820
how do you...?

378
00:28:30,324 --> 00:28:32,326
Does it ever go away?

379
00:28:35,829 --> 00:28:37,331
Is it possible?

380
00:28:49,843 --> 00:28:51,845
(sits mug on table)

381
00:29:10,364 --> 00:29:13,867
AGNIS:
Her name was Irene.

382
00:29:13,867 --> 00:29:15,869
The love of my life.

383
00:29:25,379 --> 00:29:27,381
You look happy.

384
00:29:30,384 --> 00:29:33,387
So, yeah, it is possible.

385
00:29:37,891 --> 00:29:41,395
QUOYLE:
Agnis tells me we got to move
for the winter.

386
00:29:41,395 --> 00:29:44,398
It'll be a three-hour drive
from here to the Point.

387
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:45,899
All the ice...

388
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:48,402
Me and Bunny,
we're going to
have to find

389
00:29:48,402 --> 00:29:49,903
a room in town somewhere.

390
00:29:49,903 --> 00:29:52,906
I'll have the usual,
please, Annie. Thank you.

391
00:29:57,911 --> 00:30:00,914
Well, if it's a place
to stay you need

392
00:30:00,914 --> 00:30:02,916
you can have
my trailer.

393
00:30:02,916 --> 00:30:03,917
Timing's perfect.

394
00:30:03,917 --> 00:30:05,419
What are you talking about?

395
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:06,920
My boat's ready.

396
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,423
If I stay here
any longer

397
00:30:09,423 --> 00:30:10,424
I might begin
to like the place.

398
00:30:10,924 --> 00:30:13,427
I'm throwing myself
a farewell party on Saturday.

399
00:30:13,427 --> 00:30:15,929
Departure to
follow Sunday.

400
00:30:15,929 --> 00:30:18,432
The rootless traitor.

401
00:30:18,432 --> 00:30:20,934
Regrets soon after,
no doubt.

402
00:30:28,442 --> 00:30:31,445
(boisterous din)

403
00:30:31,445 --> 00:30:33,447
(bottles breaking)

404
00:30:33,447 --> 00:30:35,449
(laughter)

405
00:30:35,949 --> 00:30:36,950
Quoyle of the North!

406
00:30:39,953 --> 00:30:40,954
Quoyle of the North.

407
00:30:40,954 --> 00:30:43,457
Have you and Wavey
done the dirty yet?

408
00:30:43,457 --> 00:30:49,963
(slurred):
Shh! She's the grieving widow.

409
00:30:49,963 --> 00:30:51,965
Grieving for
Herold Prowse.

410
00:30:51,965 --> 00:30:53,467
Oh, that's a good one.

411
00:30:53,467 --> 00:30:55,469
Let me tell you
something

412
00:30:55,469 --> 00:30:57,471
about old Herold Prowse.

413
00:30:57,471 --> 00:30:59,473
It's like a party game
in town--

414
00:30:59,473 --> 00:31:00,974
to look at babies

415
00:31:00,974 --> 00:31:03,477
and see if they look
like Herold.

416
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:06,480
Hey...

417
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,481
Hey!

418
00:31:09,983 --> 00:31:10,984
Everyone!

419
00:31:10,984 --> 00:31:13,987
To Nutbeem!

420
00:31:13,987 --> 00:31:15,989
ALL:
To Nutbeem!

421
00:31:15,989 --> 00:31:17,991
We all loves

422
00:31:17,991 --> 00:31:19,993
our fucking Nutbeem, huh?!

423
00:31:19,993 --> 00:31:21,495
(all cheer)

424
00:31:21,495 --> 00:31:23,497
Lets us keep him here then!

425
00:31:23,497 --> 00:31:24,498
(all cheer)

426
00:31:24,498 --> 00:31:28,502
Got your chainsaw,
Neddie?

427
00:31:28,502 --> 00:31:30,504
(all cheer)

428
00:31:30,504 --> 00:31:33,006
(chainsaw buzzes)

429
00:31:33,006 --> 00:31:34,007
ALL:
Nutbeem!

430
00:31:44,518 --> 00:31:47,521
Hoh-oh-oh!

431
00:31:47,521 --> 00:31:49,022
(chainsaw buzzing)

432
00:32:00,534 --> 00:32:03,537
(blows echoing)

433
00:32:03,537 --> 00:32:05,539
(woman screaming)

434
00:32:14,548 --> 00:32:17,050
(grunting)

435
00:32:23,557 --> 00:32:26,560
(bird hooting)

436
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,563
(accordion playing
in distance)

437
00:32:29,563 --> 00:32:31,064
(grunts)

438
00:32:38,071 --> 00:32:41,074
(accordion grows louder)

439
00:32:51,084 --> 00:32:54,087
(pounding)

440
00:33:00,594 --> 00:33:02,095
What's wrong?

441
00:33:02,095 --> 00:33:05,599
(slurring):
I'm a Quoyle.

442
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:07,100
I'm one of the Quoyles

443
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,604
pirates and looters
and murderers.

444
00:33:10,604 --> 00:33:15,609
My father raped
his little sister

445
00:33:15,609 --> 00:33:17,611
and then he taught me
how to swim.

446
00:33:21,615 --> 00:33:23,116
Stop that.

447
00:33:23,116 --> 00:33:25,118
Jesus, you smell
like a brewery.

448
00:33:25,118 --> 00:33:26,119
Stop it.

449
00:33:28,622 --> 00:33:30,123
Go on, Herry. Go on.

450
00:33:30,123 --> 00:33:33,126
(whimpering)

451
00:33:33,126 --> 00:33:34,628
Stop it!

452
00:33:38,632 --> 00:33:40,634
Herry.

453
00:33:43,136 --> 00:33:44,638
Sorry, Herry.

454
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,643
(sobbing gasps)

455
00:33:49,643 --> 00:33:53,146
(voice breaking):
I'm sorry, Petal.

456
00:33:53,146 --> 00:33:55,148
I'm so sorry.

457
00:33:55,148 --> 00:33:57,150
(sniffles)

458
00:33:58,652 --> 00:34:00,654
I meant Wavey.

459
00:34:00,654 --> 00:34:06,159
Good. I feel much better.

460
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,664
When were you going to tell me
about your fucked-up marriage?

461
00:34:22,175 --> 00:34:24,678
?  ?

462
00:34:50,203 --> 00:34:51,705
I'm scrambling eggs.

463
00:34:52,205 --> 00:34:53,707
Are you going
to be able to eat?

464
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:56,710
No.

465
00:35:00,213 --> 00:35:03,216
Listen, I'm...

466
00:35:08,221 --> 00:35:10,724
Maybe I should just go.

467
00:35:14,227 --> 00:35:17,731
You forget where
the door is?

468
00:35:33,246 --> 00:35:34,748
(door closes)

469
00:35:34,748 --> 00:35:37,250
(pan clattering)

470
00:35:39,252 --> 00:35:41,254
He ran off to Winnipeg
with some little bitch.

471
00:35:41,254 --> 00:35:43,256
She was barely
out of high school.

472
00:35:43,256 --> 00:35:46,259
Is that fucked up enough
for you?

473
00:35:46,259 --> 00:35:49,262
Herold...

474
00:35:49,262 --> 00:35:51,264
my husband,
he didn't die.

475
00:35:51,264 --> 00:35:53,767
Not that he didn't
deserve to.

476
00:35:53,767 --> 00:35:56,269
He left me when I was
eight months pregnant;

477
00:35:56,269 --> 00:35:57,771
no good to him in bed.

478
00:35:57,771 --> 00:36:01,775
So I took his 15-footer
out into the bay

479
00:36:01,775 --> 00:36:05,278
cracked the hull with
a hatchet and sunk her

480
00:36:05,278 --> 00:36:08,281
and pretended
he was drowned

481
00:36:08,281 --> 00:36:10,283
and played the grieving widow

482
00:36:10,283 --> 00:36:12,786
and packed my bags
to leave town.

483
00:36:12,786 --> 00:36:14,788
But then a funny thing happened.

484
00:36:14,788 --> 00:36:16,790
All these folk I grew up with

485
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:19,292
they put their hearts
around me and Herry

486
00:36:19,292 --> 00:36:20,794
so we wouldn't be alone.

487
00:36:22,295 --> 00:36:25,298
And I just
couldn't leave.

488
00:36:25,298 --> 00:36:27,801
I'm sorry, Wavey.

489
00:36:27,801 --> 00:36:30,303
You're always sorry.

490
00:36:55,829 --> 00:36:58,331
(crying softly)

491
00:37:06,339 --> 00:37:09,342
(footsteps approaching)

492
00:37:10,844 --> 00:37:14,347
You're looking dishy,
Quoyle.

493
00:37:14,347 --> 00:37:17,350
I'm afraid my offer
to let you stay in my trailer

494
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:19,352
will have to be retracted.

495
00:37:23,857 --> 00:37:27,360
Sorry about that.

496
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,863
And your boat.

497
00:37:29,863 --> 00:37:34,868
I'm some disgusted
with the human race.

498
00:37:34,868 --> 00:37:37,370
I never would have
made it anyway.

499
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:39,873
Storms would have
blown me to bits.

500
00:37:39,873 --> 00:37:43,376
You boys saved my life,
I imagine.

501
00:37:44,878 --> 00:37:48,882
I've gathered up my savings,
and I'm flying back to Brazil

502
00:37:48,882 --> 00:37:53,386
where the water is
swimming-pool green.

503
00:37:55,388 --> 00:37:59,392
You and Bunny can stay
with the wife and me.

504
00:38:01,895 --> 00:38:03,396
To Brazil.

505
00:38:04,898 --> 00:38:06,399
Brazil.

506
00:38:06,399 --> 00:38:07,901
NUTBEEM:
Brazil.

507
00:38:07,901 --> 00:38:09,903
QUOYLE:
Brazil.

508
00:38:11,905 --> 00:38:16,409
BUNNY:
We can stay with Aunt Agnis
over at her shop.

509
00:38:16,409 --> 00:38:17,911
Barely enough room
there for myself.

510
00:38:17,911 --> 00:38:19,913
You'll like it at
Dennis' house, sweetie.

511
00:38:19,913 --> 00:38:22,916
No, I won't.

512
00:38:22,916 --> 00:38:23,917
Hi, Quoyle. Hi, Bunny.

513
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:24,918
Welcome, weary travelers.

514
00:38:25,418 --> 00:38:26,419
Our home's your home.

515
00:38:26,419 --> 00:38:27,420
BUNNY:
No, it's not.
Come on in.

516
00:38:27,921 --> 00:38:29,422
QUOYLE:
Bunny...
Come on in, sweetie.

517
00:38:29,422 --> 00:38:31,925
I made a big
seal-flipper pie.

518
00:38:31,925 --> 00:38:33,426
BUNNY:
What's that?

519
00:38:33,426 --> 00:38:35,929
BEETY:
Weather light.
Storm coming.

520
00:38:35,929 --> 00:38:38,932
DENNIS:
Big one.

521
00:38:44,938 --> 00:38:46,940
(distant thunder rumbling)

522
00:39:06,459 --> 00:39:09,462
(thunder rumbling)

523
00:39:15,468 --> 00:39:19,973
The house... the house...

524
00:39:19,973 --> 00:39:21,474
house...

525
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,481
(gasps)

526
00:39:28,982 --> 00:39:30,984
(panting)

527
00:39:30,984 --> 00:39:34,988
(thunder crashing)

528
00:39:59,012 --> 00:40:03,016
(reading softly)
(thunder rumbling)

529
00:40:21,534 --> 00:40:23,536
?  ?

530
00:40:38,051 --> 00:40:40,553
I...

531
00:40:40,553 --> 00:40:44,057
What is it, Quoyle?

532
00:40:44,057 --> 00:40:47,060
What?

533
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:50,063
(thunder crashes)

534
00:41:00,573 --> 00:41:03,076
(door creaks open)

535
00:41:08,081 --> 00:41:10,083
(closes door)

536
00:41:18,591 --> 00:41:20,593
(thunder crashes)

537
00:41:33,106 --> 00:41:36,609
(thunder rumbling)

538
00:41:40,113 --> 00:41:42,615
?  ?

539
00:41:42,615 --> 00:41:45,618
(Celtic drums)

540
00:42:10,143 --> 00:42:12,145
?  ?

541
00:42:33,166 --> 00:42:36,169
(wind howling)

542
00:43:02,195 --> 00:43:04,697
It's gone.

543
00:43:04,697 --> 00:43:05,698
What?

544
00:43:05,698 --> 00:43:08,701
The green house is gone.

545
00:43:12,205 --> 00:43:15,708
I didn't dream it.

546
00:43:15,708 --> 00:43:18,211
Don't say I did.

547
00:43:20,213 --> 00:43:22,715
(phone ringing)

548
00:43:24,717 --> 00:43:26,219
Yeah?

549
00:43:26,219 --> 00:43:28,721
Oh, hi, Mom.
Some storm, eh?

550
00:43:30,723 --> 00:43:32,225
What?

551
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:39,232
Oh.

552
00:43:41,734 --> 00:43:44,237
Yes. Yes, of course.

553
00:44:05,758 --> 00:44:08,761
BUNNY:
What's a wake?

554
00:44:08,761 --> 00:44:10,763
QUOYLE:
It's to say good-bye.

555
00:44:10,763 --> 00:44:13,766
BUNNY:
Mr. Buggit is sleeping
with the angels.

556
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:19,772
MAN 1:
He was a hard man,
but he was fair.

557
00:44:19,772 --> 00:44:21,774
MAN 2:
Another one
for the Buggit Curse.

558
00:44:21,774 --> 00:44:23,276
QUOYLE:
Dennis...

559
00:44:23,276 --> 00:44:25,278
Yeah, I'm still
looking for my
dad's Navy medal.

560
00:44:25,778 --> 00:44:27,780
I found it.

561
00:44:30,283 --> 00:44:31,284
Don't you worry.

562
00:44:31,284 --> 00:44:32,785
It's going to be
all right.

563
00:44:32,785 --> 00:44:34,287
Thank you.

564
00:44:34,287 --> 00:44:36,289
Mom.

565
00:44:36,289 --> 00:44:38,291
What?

566
00:44:38,291 --> 00:44:39,792
(gasps softly):
Good...

567
00:44:39,792 --> 00:44:42,295
I found it...
in his desk at the office.

568
00:44:42,295 --> 00:44:47,800
Would you write something for
theGammy Birdabout Jack?

569
00:44:48,801 --> 00:44:50,803
Yes, I'll try.

570
00:44:54,807 --> 00:44:58,811
BILLY:
Jack is...
Jack is all right now.

571
00:44:58,811 --> 00:45:03,316
You all know...
we are only passing by.

572
00:45:03,316 --> 00:45:07,320
We walk over these stones
a few times.

573
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,823
Our boats...

574
00:45:10,823 --> 00:45:12,825
sail for a little while
on the waves

575
00:45:12,825 --> 00:45:15,828
and then they have to sink.

576
00:45:15,828 --> 00:45:17,830
Jack knew that
better than anyone.

577
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:19,832
Right, Jack?

578
00:45:19,832 --> 00:45:21,334
(whispering):
Yes, boy.

579
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:28,341
(gulps)

580
00:45:28,341 --> 00:45:30,343
(screams)

581
00:45:30,343 --> 00:45:31,844
(others screaming)

582
00:45:34,347 --> 00:45:36,349
(screaming continues)

583
00:45:36,349 --> 00:45:38,851
(screaming)

584
00:45:43,356 --> 00:45:44,857
He's awake!

585
00:45:48,361 --> 00:45:49,362
Jack...

586
00:45:49,362 --> 00:45:50,363
Get a doctor!

587
00:45:50,363 --> 00:45:52,365
Oh, Jack... oh, Jack...

588
00:45:52,365 --> 00:45:53,866
(coughing)

589
00:45:55,868 --> 00:45:57,370
Oh, Jack...

590
00:45:57,870 --> 00:45:59,872
No, no...

591
00:45:59,872 --> 00:46:02,375
JACK:
Come here, son.
I beat the curse.

592
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:05,378
The fishing license is yours.

593
00:46:11,884 --> 00:46:13,886
(siren chirps)

594
00:46:15,388 --> 00:46:17,390
Sweetheart, you ready?

595
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:19,892
I want to have a wake for Petal.

596
00:46:20,893 --> 00:46:22,895
Why didn't we have
a wake?

597
00:46:23,396 --> 00:46:24,897
Why didn't we wake her up?

598
00:46:24,897 --> 00:46:27,400
It worked forhim.

599
00:46:29,402 --> 00:46:32,405
Honey, Mr. Buggit
wasn't really...

600
00:46:32,405 --> 00:46:33,906
It's more like
he was in a coma.

601
00:46:33,906 --> 00:46:35,908
From the cold water.

602
00:46:35,908 --> 00:46:37,410
It's like he
was sleeping.

603
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:38,911
Petal was asleep.
No, honey...

604
00:46:38,911 --> 00:46:40,413
You said she was asleep
with the angels.

605
00:46:40,413 --> 00:46:43,916
I know. Honey, I know
what I said, honey.
You said! You said!

606
00:46:43,916 --> 00:46:45,918
I know, but she's
not sleeping.
You said! You said!

607
00:46:45,918 --> 00:46:47,920
Honey, honey, listen to me.
You said!

608
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,921
I know what I said.

609
00:46:48,921 --> 00:46:50,923
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

610
00:46:50,923 --> 00:46:54,927
I just... I was too scared
to tell you the truth.

611
00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:00,933
Petal is dead.

612
00:47:02,935 --> 00:47:04,937
And you know that.

613
00:47:04,937 --> 00:47:06,439
I know you know it.

614
00:47:11,444 --> 00:47:13,946
It's okay.

615
00:47:14,947 --> 00:47:18,951
Is it because of me?

616
00:47:18,951 --> 00:47:20,453
What?

617
00:47:20,453 --> 00:47:22,955
That she drove away.

618
00:47:22,955 --> 00:47:25,958
Well, why would you
say that?

619
00:47:25,958 --> 00:47:27,960
Because...

620
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,963
because I'm boring.

621
00:47:34,967 --> 00:47:35,968
(crying)

622
00:47:35,968 --> 00:47:37,470
Oh...

623
00:47:39,972 --> 00:47:43,976
No, honey, it's not
because of you.

624
00:47:46,479 --> 00:47:49,482
And you are anything
but boring.

625
00:47:49,482 --> 00:47:51,984
Come here.

626
00:47:51,984 --> 00:47:54,487
You just come here.

627
00:47:55,488 --> 00:47:57,990
Hon...

628
00:47:59,492 --> 00:48:01,994
You believe me, don't you?

629
00:48:04,997 --> 00:48:09,502
You still don't
believeme,do you?

630
00:48:10,503 --> 00:48:13,005
About the house.

631
00:48:17,009 --> 00:48:19,512
I told you so.

632
00:48:32,525 --> 00:48:35,027
It's all right.

633
00:48:35,027 --> 00:48:37,029
Worse things have happened.

634
00:48:37,029 --> 00:48:40,533
To both of us.

635
00:48:40,533 --> 00:48:45,037
Maybe one day we'll build
a summerhouse out here.

636
00:48:45,037 --> 00:48:48,040
Summer...

637
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,543
BUNNY:
Do theyhavesummer here?

638
00:48:50,543 --> 00:48:54,046
AGNIS:
Oh, you'll know it's summer when
the partridge berries are out.

639
00:48:54,046 --> 00:48:56,549
WAVEY:
And we can make
partridge berry duff

640
00:48:56,549 --> 00:48:59,552
and sweet berry okie.

641
00:48:59,552 --> 00:49:02,054
Will you show me how?

642
00:49:02,054 --> 00:49:04,056
I will, yeah.

643
00:49:04,056 --> 00:49:05,558
I will.

644
00:49:05,558 --> 00:49:10,062
QUOYLE:
There are still so many things
I don't know.

645
00:49:10,062 --> 00:49:13,682
If a piece of knotted string
can unleash the wind

646
00:49:13,682 --> 00:49:17,686
and if a drowned man
can awaken...

647
00:49:19,188 --> 00:49:22,191
then I believe
a broken man can heal.

648
00:49:29,214 --> 00:49:31,717
Headline:

649
00:49:31,717 --> 00:49:34,219
Deadly Storm Takes House.

650
00:49:36,221 --> 00:49:40,225
Leaves... Excellent View.
