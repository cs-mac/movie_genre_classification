It is.

Yeah. For me.

00:02:46,507 --> 00:02:47,915
I thought you were
sound asleep.

Yeah? What about it?

Well, I was
just thinking

132
00:08:15,285 --> 00:08:17,141
It might be better
if, uh,

133
00:08:17,207 --> 00:08:18,903
maybe just one of us
dealt with it.

You know, they're not
really the kind

To go for
that hard sell.

wants to do it?

You wanna do it?

Wow. Well...

If you're sure.

146

I don't know. Is that
ok with you, Jerry?

00:08:42,449 --> 00:08:43,985
But we did the heavy
lifting on that.

No. It's fine.

he'll want to keep him

Late again tonight
or what?

Uh, no.
I don't think so.

Good. 'cause I got
something special planned.

Listen, Judy.
Can I ask you something?

00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,084
Do you think this
means a promotion?

171
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:36,901
Well, let's just say
it's looking good.

172
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:38,311
[laughs]

173
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:40,010
Oh!

174
00:09:40,075 --> 00:09:42,829
You did it again, Neil.

175
00:09:42,894 --> 00:09:44,846
Hey, what can I say?

176
00:09:44,912 --> 00:09:47,376
You just gotta raise
your game. That's all.

177
00:09:47,442 --> 00:09:48,625
Be on him more.

178
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,772
Come on. It's nothing
personal. You know that.

179
00:09:53,495 --> 00:09:55,033
But that's what
it takes, right?

180
00:09:55,097 --> 00:09:55,738
I don't know. Does it?

181
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,081
I feel bad for him,

182
00:09:57,147 --> 00:09:58,428
But what am I
supposed to do?

183
00:09:58,492 --> 00:09:59,934
All right, all right.

184
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,374
So how was your day?

185
00:10:01,439 --> 00:10:02,591
Eh.
Yeah?

186
00:10:02,657 --> 00:10:04,417
Hmm.

187
00:10:04,484 --> 00:10:06,947
Well,
that was fantastic.

188
00:10:07,013 --> 00:10:08,422
[music playing]

189
00:10:08,487 --> 00:10:11,592
Tastes even better
since I quit the smokes.

190
00:10:11,657 --> 00:10:13,291
Mmm.

191
00:10:15,085 --> 00:10:16,335
Our song.

192

# I'll take care of you #

194
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:23,573
What are you thinking?

195
00:10:23,638 --> 00:10:27,096
# I love and lost #

196

Oh, you devil.

199
00:10:33,312 --> 00:10:36,129
# so you see, I know #

200

# just what
you've been through #

201

# here's what I'll do #

# oh, I'll take
care of you #

204
00:10:50,866 --> 00:10:53,043
What if I asked you
to stay this weekend?

205
00:10:56,567 --> 00:11:00,218
Abby, you know
I want to.

206
00:11:00,283 --> 00:11:02,523
Stop.
I was just kidding.

207
00:11:02,654 --> 00:11:04,382
Just kidding.

208
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:06,111
I know how much
this means to you.

209
00:11:06,176 --> 00:11:08,482
I mean, how often does
he invite an executive

210
00:11:08,546 --> 00:11:09,699
To his country estate?

211
00:11:09,763 --> 00:11:12,838
No. Important for
both of us, honey.

212
00:11:12,903 --> 00:11:14,184
For both of us.

213

# dry your weeping eyes #

214

Give me.

Abby: You ready?

218
00:11:26,582 --> 00:11:27,860
I'm packed.

219
00:11:27,925 --> 00:11:29,015
I love that one, honey.

220
00:11:31,353 --> 00:11:32,955
I'm not trying
to seduce him, babe.

221
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:34,717
Well, it will remind
you of me.

222
00:11:34,782 --> 00:11:35,805
It might bring you luck.

223
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:36,766
[doorbell rings]

224
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,727
I got it.
That's almost sweet.

225
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:38,751
We'd better get going

226
00:11:38,817 --> 00:11:40,353
If you want to get
to Diane's in time.

227
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:42,692
Hello.
Hello.

228
00:11:42,758 --> 00:11:43,942
I'm Helen Schriver.
The agency sent me.

229
00:11:44,135 --> 00:11:44,999
Come in.

230
00:11:45,096 --> 00:11:47,401
I'm a little early.

231
00:11:47,467 --> 00:11:49,066
It's ok. This is
my husband Neil.

232
00:11:49,132 --> 00:11:50,379
Hey, Helen.

233
00:11:50,636 --> 00:11:51,565
Hello.

234
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:54,832
Oh, look at you.
You must be Sophie.

235
00:11:54,898 --> 00:11:56,402
This is Helen, the lady
that I told you about

236
00:11:56,468 --> 00:11:57,428
That's gonna sit
for you tonight.

237
00:11:57,685 --> 00:11:58,740
Hey.

238
00:11:58,805 --> 00:11:59,893
Who's that?

239
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:01,015
Her name's Sherry.

240
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,423
We're playing a game.

241
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:04,507
Could I play, too?
Ok.

242
00:12:04,572 --> 00:12:05,659
Why don't you
go show Helen

243
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,710
The swimming pool
you built for Sherry.

244
00:12:07,774 --> 00:12:08,893
Thanks.

245
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,647
Oh, that's a really cool
swimming pool.

246
00:12:16,712 --> 00:12:18,056
Do you want to put
a diving board

247
00:12:18,122 --> 00:12:19,464
On the end of it?

248
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,778
What? What's wrong?

249
00:12:20,844 --> 00:12:22,347
She seems a bit old,
don't you think?

250
00:12:22,413 --> 00:12:24,334
I thought the agency
would send someone younger.

251
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,520
Oh, yeah. That's right.

252
00:12:25,584 --> 00:12:26,833
Someone who could
spend all night

253
00:12:26,897 --> 00:12:28,018
On the phone
with her boyfriend

254
00:12:28,084 --> 00:12:29,682
While the house
burns down.

255
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:30,869
Fine.

256
00:12:30,933 --> 00:12:32,053
Ouch.

257
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:33,014
Oh, babe.

258
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:34,200
Could you get
my black Prada pressed

259
00:12:34,265 --> 00:12:35,514
While I'm gone?

260
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:37,436
It'll make
my whole weekend, honey.

261
00:12:37,501 --> 00:12:38,557
Sophie: This is rabbit.

262
00:12:38,621 --> 00:12:40,638
We watch TV together.

263
00:12:40,703 --> 00:12:42,817
I love you, sweetie.
I'll see you tonight, ok?

264
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:44,097
Bye, mommy.
Bye, honey.

265

[whispers]
here you go, baby.

266
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,237
Daddy's gonna miss you.

00:12:47,303 --> 00:12:48,390
Bye-bye.

268
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,875
Don't tell mom.
Ok.

269
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,124
Shh.

270
00:12:54,189 --> 00:12:56,174
Mwah!

271
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:57,584
Bye, daddy.

00:12:57,648 --> 00:12:59,858
Bye. Oh, Helen...

273
00:12:59,922 --> 00:13:01,939
If my wife gets back
before midnight,

274
00:13:02,004 --> 00:13:03,702
Do not let her in.

275
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:04,951
She's under
strict instructions

276
00:13:05,016 --> 00:13:06,072
To have a good time.

277
00:13:06,137 --> 00:13:07,386
Helen: Ok.

278
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:09,308
Baby, did I pack
my razors?

279
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:11,709
No, you didn't.
I did.

280
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:13,600
What would I do
without you, huh?

281
00:13:16,452 --> 00:13:17,508
Bye, baby.

282
00:13:17,572 --> 00:13:18,469
Sophie:
miss you.

in 20, Diane. Ok?

286
00:13:37,177 --> 00:13:39,290
Neil's got a promotion
to get, remember?

287
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:41,242
Ok. Bye.
[cell phone beeps]

288
00:13:41,307 --> 00:13:43,485
Neil: Baby, let's not get
carried away with this, ok?

289
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,055
I mean, we don't know
if he's gonna offer me

290
00:13:45,151 --> 00:13:47,521
A partnership.
We just don't.

291
00:13:47,587 --> 00:13:49,443
I mean, he may just want
to bond, talk business.

292
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:50,885
That's if I can even
find this place.

293
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:51,942
It's in the middle
of nowhere.

294
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,747
Ok. What's on your mind?

295
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:01,070
Just thinking about
how far we've come.

296
00:14:01,135 --> 00:14:03,185
Yeah, we have.

297
00:14:03,249 --> 00:14:05,267
Didn't I promise you
it'd be worth it?

298
00:14:05,332 --> 00:14:06,517
Come on.
We were leading

299
00:14:06,581 --> 00:14:07,638
Separate lives
in Denver.

300
00:14:07,702 --> 00:14:10,201
Now, look at us.

301
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,961
You know what
I'm also thinking?

302
00:14:12,027 --> 00:14:13,627
I'm gonna start calling around
to some of the agencies.

303
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,184
No. What, get back
into photography?

304
00:14:17,249 --> 00:14:18,657
Yes. Just locally.

305
00:14:18,721 --> 00:14:20,707
I mean, I think my days
of cruising the freeways

306
00:14:20,773 --> 00:14:23,558
Are long gone.

307
00:14:23,623 --> 00:14:25,736
Yeah. Why don't you
go for it?

308
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,050
Abby:
you don't mind?

309
00:14:27,115 --> 00:14:30,093
Mind? I think
it's a great idea.

310
00:14:30,157 --> 00:14:31,213

Neil: What the hell
are you doing?

315
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,638
Get your hands
on the wheel!

316
00:14:39,704 --> 00:14:41,368
Keep your hands
on the goddamn wheel!

317
00:14:41,432 --> 00:14:42,904
What do you want?
Huh?

318
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:44,251
What do you want?

319
00:14:44,315 --> 00:14:46,908
I've got
what I want.

320
00:14:46,975 --> 00:14:47,870
Right here.

321
00:14:47,936 --> 00:14:48,831
What do you mean?

322
00:14:48,897 --> 00:14:49,792
Nice and easy.

323
00:14:49,858 --> 00:14:50,978
Please, don't do
anything stupid, ok?

324
00:14:51,042 --> 00:14:52,098
Nice and easy.
Nice and steady.

325
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,764
Ok, I'm steady.
I'm steady.

[indistinct]

327
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:58,793
Here you go.
It's for you.

328
00:14:58,859 --> 00:14:59,946
Take it.
Take it.

329
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,310
[grunts]

330
00:15:05,553 --> 00:15:06,705
It's Sophie.

331
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:08,338
Oh, Christ, no!
Don't you--

332
00:15:08,403 --> 00:15:10,068
Don't you want
to talk?

333

Neil:
they know me.

501
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,165
I've taken
clients there.

502
00:23:34,736 --> 00:23:37,009
Well, now you're taking
a new client.

Hi, uh...

505
00:23:43,607 --> 00:23:44,536
Mr. Randall.

506
00:23:44,601 --> 00:23:45,721
[french accent]
good afternoon, sir.

507
00:23:45,786 --> 00:23:47,516
Pleasure
to see you again.

508
00:23:47,581 --> 00:23:48,668
Now, um,

509
00:23:48,734 --> 00:23:52,000
We have a table for three,
please?

510
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:53,120
Right this way.

511
00:23:53,186 --> 00:23:54,242
May I take
your coats?

512
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:56,677
It's all right.

513
00:23:59,977 --> 00:24:01,930
Waiter: What can
I get you to drink?

514
00:24:01,996 --> 00:24:04,364
Nothing, thank you.

515
00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:07,471
Ahh, good bottle
of wine. Red.

516
00:24:07,536 --> 00:24:09,553
Something around,
uh, 200 bucks.

517
00:24:09,619 --> 00:24:10,514
Yes, sir.

518
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,396
And these prices--

519
00:24:13,462 --> 00:24:14,679
What would
you recommend, Neil?

520
00:24:16,633 --> 00:24:17,945
Who do you think you are?

521
00:24:18,971 --> 00:24:19,900
Oh, that's easy.

522
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,550
Right now,

523

I'm god.

Abby:
please just tell us

525
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,293
What you want us
to do.

526
00:24:30,631 --> 00:24:31,977
You know,
people are always saying

527
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:33,321
They'd do anything
for their kids.

528
00:24:34,795 --> 00:24:35,691
Anything.

529
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:38,671
So I'm going
to put that to the test.

530
00:24:38,735 --> 00:24:40,241
For the next 24 hours,
you're mine,

531
00:24:40,305 --> 00:24:42,035
Then you get her back.
You got it?

532
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,996
Hmm.

can I take your order?

534
00:24:45,558 --> 00:24:47,063
Yeah, I guess--

535
00:24:47,127 --> 00:24:49,081
I guess you got
steak in here.

536
00:24:49,145 --> 00:24:51,739
Yes, sir.
Steak Dauphinoise.

537
00:24:51,805 --> 00:24:53,405
Ok. That'll do. Yeah.

538
00:24:53,471 --> 00:24:55,679
Um, rare. Thank you.

Excuse me.

What do you mean
we've gotta run?

548
00:25:14,131 --> 00:25:17,109
Well, we gotta pay
for this somehow.

549
00:25:17,173 --> 00:25:18,294
And I'm all out of cash.

550
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,768
So what are we supposed
to do about that?

00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:21,306
You're going to walk
out of here right now.

You're not going to talk

To your buddy
on the door,

00:25:23,292 --> 00:25:23,773
And you're going
to go get some.

And if you're
not back here by 5:30

With say, 300 bucks,

Well, you know
what they say.

558

Never pick a fight
with someone

nothing to lose.

on this side of town.

How does he know
about our lives?

What have we done
to him?

done anything, babe.

That's what it is.

Do you know him from work?
Tell me.

Is it from accounts?

No. What enough
that he'd take our kid?

00:29:09,407 --> 00:29:11,808
You're not worried,
are you?

663
00:29:11,873 --> 00:29:13,058
She might see a cop.

664
00:29:13,122 --> 00:29:15,011
Start getting ideas.

665
00:29:15,077 --> 00:29:15,652
No, she'll do it.

666
00:29:17,895 --> 00:29:19,464
[gasps]

667
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:20,393
Uhh.
Abby!

668
00:29:20,457 --> 00:29:22,155
Wait. Leave it.
Leave it.

669
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,468
You son of a bitch!

670
00:29:23,534 --> 00:29:25,198
Just leave it, ok?

671
00:29:25,262 --> 00:29:26,735
All right?

672
00:29:26,801 --> 00:29:29,650
Anger's good, Neil.

673
00:29:29,714 --> 00:29:31,476
Come on.

674
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,726
Come on. Let's go.

675
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:33,879
Let's go.

676
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,643
Boy: Hey!

677
00:29:41,342 --> 00:29:42,047
Hey!

678
00:29:45,443 --> 00:29:46,371
Hey.

679
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:53,066
One word
and your daughter's dead.

680
00:29:55,149 --> 00:29:55,949
Hey.
Dad.

681
00:29:58,033 --> 00:30:00,081
It's good to see you, son.
How are you?

682
00:30:00,146 --> 00:30:01,425
What are you
doing here?

683
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,347
Uh, well, I just, uh,

684
00:30:03,412 --> 00:30:05,110
Had to come in for work,

685
00:30:05,174 --> 00:30:06,583
And, uh,

686
00:30:06,648 --> 00:30:07,704
Well, what about you?

687
00:30:07,769 --> 00:30:08,634
I mean, I wouldn't
expect to see you

688
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:09,595
On the Westside.

689
00:30:09,691 --> 00:30:10,682
Kory, that girl

690
00:30:10,748 --> 00:30:11,933
I met
in social studies.

691
00:30:11,997 --> 00:30:14,047
She lives just
down the street, so.

692
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:15,199
Good. [chuckles]

693
00:30:15,266 --> 00:30:16,865
Good.

694
00:30:18,468 --> 00:30:20,101
Is, uh,
everything ok?

695
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:21,413
Yeah, I'm fine.

696
00:30:21,479 --> 00:30:24,169
Oh, just work, job.

697
00:30:24,234 --> 00:30:25,835
I got a lot on my mind
and stuff.

698
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,237
Listen, we gotta run.

699
00:30:28,302 --> 00:30:29,423
I'll catch you
later on, ok?

700
00:30:29,584 --> 00:30:30,670
Yeah, sure.

701
00:30:30,737 --> 00:30:35,156
Could you--
uh, use a ride, or...

702
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,885
Yeah.
Neil.

703
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:39,416
Have you forgotten
something?

704
00:30:39,481 --> 00:30:41,274
If you're late?

705
00:30:41,338 --> 00:30:43,485
Huh?

706
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,925
Your wife'll kill you.

707
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,272
Yeah, I forgot.

708
00:30:47,457 --> 00:30:48,610
I'm sorry, son.
We're pushed for time.

709
00:30:48,674 --> 00:30:50,499
I'll talk
to you later, ok?

710
00:30:50,565 --> 00:30:51,492
Sure.

711
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,030
[engine starts]

712
00:31:18,464 --> 00:31:20,898
So you got
a child of your own

713
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:22,019
And you put us
through this.

714
00:31:24,807 --> 00:31:26,054
What's he going to think
of the two of you

715
00:31:26,121 --> 00:31:26,855
When this comes out?

716
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,598
[telephones ringing]

717
00:31:37,108 --> 00:31:38,324
Have you thought
about that?

718
00:31:41,112 --> 00:31:42,294
[engine accelerates]

719
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,128
[brakes squeal]

720
00:31:48,927 --> 00:31:51,361
Hey, what's he going
to think, huh?

721
00:31:51,426 --> 00:31:52,898
Tell me.

722
00:31:52,962 --> 00:31:54,404
Come on.

723
00:31:54,468 --> 00:31:55,652
What's he going to think?

724
00:31:55,718 --> 00:31:57,158
What's he going
to tell Kory

725
00:31:57,223 --> 00:31:58,696
When mom and dad
are on the evening news?

726
00:31:58,761 --> 00:32:00,522
Have you thought
about that?

727
00:32:00,587 --> 00:32:01,996
Well, have you?

728
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:08,114
What the hell
are you doing?!

729
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,958
[panting and grunting]

730
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:16,570
Uhh.

731
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:18,908
[unwrapping plastic]

732
00:32:18,973 --> 00:32:20,190
[flicks lighter]

733
00:32:20,255 --> 00:32:21,599
How's everything
going at work?

734
00:32:21,665 --> 00:32:23,040
[gasping]

735
00:32:28,231 --> 00:32:30,472
I hear advertising's
a cutthroat business.

736
00:32:30,536 --> 00:32:31,786
A lot of pressure.

737
00:32:35,438 --> 00:32:37,103
Is that why you screw up
so many people's lives?

738
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:39,153
What are you talking about?

739
00:32:40,531 --> 00:32:41,075
Recognize that place?

740
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:45,109
Fifth floor.
Straight ahead.

741
00:32:46,584 --> 00:32:48,666
That's the head office
of Magris industries.

742
00:32:48,731 --> 00:32:51,068
You've heard of them?

743
00:32:51,133 --> 00:32:53,342
Of course you have.

744
00:32:53,407 --> 00:32:54,400
And with this

745
00:32:54,464 --> 00:32:55,809
Million dollar launch
coming up,

746
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:57,027
I'm sure
this is something

747
00:32:57,091 --> 00:32:59,012
You'd want to keep
under wraps.

748
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:00,678
What do you get for
hacking into

749
00:33:00,743 --> 00:33:02,600
Corporate information
these days?

750
00:33:03,817 --> 00:33:04,937
Where'd you get this?

751
00:33:05,003 --> 00:33:07,757
Ah, don't panic.
It's only a copy.

752
00:33:09,744 --> 00:33:11,473
Abby has the original.

753
00:33:16,183 --> 00:33:17,207
Yeah,
it's all down there

754
00:33:17,271 --> 00:33:18,168
In black and white.

755
00:33:18,232 --> 00:33:19,865
Times, places.

756
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:22,268
How you bought your way
into getting that account.

757
00:33:22,332 --> 00:33:23,964
What would
the competition do

758
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,855
With something like that?

759
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,578
Your company's reputation
will be ruined.

760
00:33:28,643 --> 00:33:29,539
But Karl
won't blame you, Neil.

761
00:33:32,231 --> 00:33:32,935
Will he?

762
00:33:35,785 --> 00:33:37,418
Well, Mr. Carver's
due back any minute,

763
00:33:37,484 --> 00:33:38,989
But I can give it
to him for you.

764
00:33:39,054 --> 00:33:40,206
No, it's ok.

765
00:33:40,271 --> 00:33:41,423
I've got to really give it
to him myself, thank you.

766
00:33:41,489 --> 00:33:42,481
Sure. Have a seat.

767
00:33:53,212 --> 00:33:54,747
You just want to destroy
everything we've got,

768
00:33:54,812 --> 00:33:55,772
Don't you?

769
00:33:55,838 --> 00:33:57,920
Look, I don't want
to destroy you, Neil.

770
00:33:57,984 --> 00:33:59,842
I'll prove it.

771
00:33:59,906 --> 00:34:01,315
I'll give you one shot.

772

[cell phone beeps]

773
00:34:03,431 --> 00:34:04,295
Stop her.

774
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:04,902
You serious?

775
00:34:04,966 --> 00:34:06,376
Stop her.

776
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,744
[grunts]

777
00:34:13,809 --> 00:34:16,114
Uhh. Come on. Come on.
Shit!

00:34:18,324 --> 00:34:20,887

[cell phone beeps]

781
00:34:25,755 --> 00:34:27,101
Hello?

782
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:28,285
Abby? It's--

783
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:30,207
It's Neil.

784
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,931
Abby, don't hand over
that envelope.

785
00:34:32,995 --> 00:34:34,660
What?
Look,

786
00:34:34,725 --> 00:34:35,973
I--I don't have time
to explain.

787
00:34:36,038 --> 00:34:37,542
Just walk out
of the office, ok?

788
00:34:37,607 --> 00:34:39,594
We have to do
what he says, Neil.

789
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:40,747
Think about Sophie.

790
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,604
Get out of there,
Abby, please.

791
00:34:42,669 --> 00:34:44,270
No, listen to me.
We have to do what he said.

792
00:34:44,335 --> 00:34:45,391
Get out of there!

793
00:34:45,456 --> 00:34:46,447
Look, he says
it's all right.

794
00:34:46,512 --> 00:34:47,664
All right.

795
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:48,818
Time's up.

796
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:05,059
Oh, no. Abby, no!

797
00:35:10,506 --> 00:35:12,041
Excuse me.
Are you Mr. Carver?

798
00:35:12,106 --> 00:35:14,924
No! Abby,
for Christ's sake, no!

799
00:35:17,745 --> 00:35:19,153
No! Don't!

800
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,651
Abby, for Christ's sake!
I said don't!

801
00:35:25,689 --> 00:35:26,359
Shit!

802
00:35:41,513 --> 00:35:43,594
Go on.

803
00:35:43,658 --> 00:35:44,587
You know
you're dying for one.

804
00:35:47,182 --> 00:35:48,814
Been thinking
about something you said

805
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,391
In that restaurant.

806
00:35:51,635 --> 00:35:52,754
Do you know what it was?

807
00:35:55,063 --> 00:35:58,296
"I'm Mr. Randall,"
you said.

808
00:35:58,361 --> 00:35:59,257
Maybe it's just me,

809
00:35:59,322 --> 00:36:00,506
But there's
something about you,

810
00:36:00,572 --> 00:36:01,467
Or anyone,

811
00:36:01,533 --> 00:36:02,716
Calling themselves mister

812
00:36:02,781 --> 00:36:04,286
That makes me feel
kind of...

813
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:07,649
Sick.

814
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:10,533
You know what I mean?

815
00:36:19,246 --> 00:36:20,974
[indistinct chatter]

816
00:36:23,057 --> 00:36:25,044
Yeah.

817
00:36:25,109 --> 00:36:26,805
You think you can
rely on someone,

818
00:36:26,871 --> 00:36:28,695
And then she just...

819
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,039
[laughs]

820
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,418
You're pathetic.

821
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,560
By comparison to you,
Neil,

822
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:39,553
Of course I'm pathetic.

823
00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:40,835
I mean,
you've got everything.

824
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,757
Great job, nice...

825
00:36:42,981 --> 00:36:44,999

826
00:36:45,064 --> 00:36:46,697
Terrific wife.

827
00:36:46,763 --> 00:36:48,330
Shit. [chuckles]

828
00:36:48,394 --> 00:36:50,412
I was going to say
lovely daughter.

Any problems?

Good.

Right.

She's watching cartoons.

Let me speak
to my daughter!

All right.
I'll check in later.

She's an attractive woman,

Don't be hard on her.

I'm so sorry.
I had to do it.

No. I know.
I didn't know

Listen, I've got
to pick something up.

You stay here.

what I--

00:37:51,113 --> 00:37:53,099
What I told you?

852
00:37:53,165 --> 00:37:54,604
Because I do
what he tells me to do

853
00:37:54,669 --> 00:37:55,598
Until he says otherwise.

854

It doesn't matter.

856
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,306
I wasn't going
to put Sophie in danger.

857
00:38:00,371 --> 00:38:02,517
Not in danger.
He told me to stop you.

Yes, but
if I had done that,

Well, that's a good girl.

Don't patronize me.

with Sophie

if bringing up your child

Has been such
a pain in the ass to you.

To you my whole life.

You listen to me.

Why don't you
just go back to Denver?

It's a really great time
to bring that up, baby.

to let that asshole--

I'll wait here.

about it, Abby.

He's really quite
the family man.

to annoy me, Neil.

he say that?

I'm calling the cops
if anything happens, ok?

00:44:55,283 --> 00:44:56,788
[lock beeps]

00:45:01,114 --> 00:45:03,131
Boy on TV: The space
beneath the rock is vacant,

She who gives--

998
00:45:04,797 --> 00:45:07,870
Girl on TV:
I want my diary!

999
00:45:07,935 --> 00:45:09,632
[bawling]

1000
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:12,675
Second boy on TV:
speaking of vacant,

1001
00:45:12,741 --> 00:45:15,559
Anybody seen
dork, dorkk, and dorky?

1002
00:45:15,624 --> 00:45:17,001
Second boy: Wow!
Good thing that problem

1003
00:45:17,066 --> 00:45:19,723
Cleared up, huh, Edd?
[laughs]

1004
00:45:19,788 --> 00:45:21,293
Edd: Enough
is enough, eddy.

1005
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:24,593
My mind is riddled with
unpleasant images.

1006
00:45:24,657 --> 00:45:25,873
I implore you. Please,

1007
00:45:25,938 --> 00:45:28,436
I could use
some help here!

1008
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,358
[indistinct]

1009
00:45:30,422 --> 00:45:33,560
That's it! I suggest we
sneak back to the house,

1010
00:45:33,626 --> 00:45:35,804
We bury the book
within its boundaries,

1011
00:45:35,869 --> 00:45:38,046
And deceptively plead
amnesia.

1012
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,807
Eddy: I like that!

1013
00:45:39,872 --> 00:45:42,209
Double d,
that's so underhanded!

1014
00:45:42,274 --> 00:45:43,843
[laughs] oh, yeah.
You're right.

1015

[fingers squeak

1016
00:45:47,913 --> 00:45:49,096
Oh.

1017
00:45:50,762 --> 00:45:53,517
You think you can
get away with anything

1018
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:55,214
Because you're just
that bit smarter

1019
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,271
Than the rest of us.

1020
00:45:57,298 --> 00:45:58,194
Huh?

1021
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:01,076
Tell me something, Neil.

1022
00:46:03,192 --> 00:46:06,137
How does it feel
to be played, huh?

1023
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:10,879
We're just trying
to save our daughter.

1024
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:14,306
Abby!

1025
00:46:18,504 --> 00:46:20,647
Where is she?
Where is she?

1026
00:46:20,712 --> 00:46:22,058
How come you didn't
have another one, Abby?

1027
00:46:22,122 --> 00:46:24,460
Hmm?

1028
00:46:24,526 --> 00:46:25,582
I'm not sure you're

1029
00:46:25,647 --> 00:46:26,959
The perfect wife you'd
like to think you are.

1030
00:46:29,331 --> 00:46:31,122
Hmm? I'm not sure
you even any better--

1031
00:46:31,187 --> 00:46:32,339
Bastard!

1032
00:46:32,405 --> 00:46:34,005
Neil: Leave her alone!
Don't you touch her.

1033
00:46:37,658 --> 00:46:40,092
[whispers]
look at me. Are you ok?

1034
00:46:40,157 --> 00:46:41,213
Here you go.

1035
00:46:42,975 --> 00:46:45,057
Put it on, Abby.

1036
00:46:45,122 --> 00:46:46,435
See, huh?

1037
00:46:46,499 --> 00:46:48,101
Want to put this on?

1038
00:46:48,165 --> 00:46:49,125
No.

1039
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:50,341
Come on, Abby,
put it on.

1040
00:46:50,406 --> 00:46:52,745
Put it on.
Take it.

1041
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:53,833
You'll pay for this.
Put it on.

1042
00:46:53,898 --> 00:46:54,890
She's not doing it.

1043
00:46:54,955 --> 00:46:56,011
Why not, huh?

1044
00:46:56,077 --> 00:46:57,229
I said
she's not doing it!

1045
00:46:57,295 --> 00:46:59,280
Why not?
She might like it.

1046
00:46:59,344 --> 00:47:00,688
I said
she's not doing it!

1047
00:47:00,753 --> 00:47:02,803
No, Neil.

1048
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:08,248
You're not putting
your big dick pride

1049
00:47:08,313 --> 00:47:09,786
Before your kid,
are you?

1050
00:47:09,851 --> 00:47:11,739
Please, stop. Don't...

1051
00:47:11,836 --> 00:47:13,757
I'll do it.

1052
00:47:13,822 --> 00:47:15,199
I'll do it, I'll do it.

1053
00:47:27,788 --> 00:47:29,774
Tom: Come on, Abby.

1054
00:47:32,977 --> 00:47:34,579
Come on.

1055
00:47:44,958 --> 00:47:46,975
Come here, come here.

1056
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:49,506
Stay there, now.

1057
00:48:03,761 --> 00:48:05,233
I think
she's enjoying this.

1058
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:10,135
Danger.

1059
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,383
Yeah.

1060
00:48:18,207 --> 00:48:20,545
Acting out the victim.

1061
00:48:23,524 --> 00:48:26,311
This is the most alive
she's felt in years.

1062
00:48:30,572 --> 00:48:31,819
Yeah,

1063
00:48:31,885 --> 00:48:33,454
Let's put the dress on.

1064
00:48:40,469 --> 00:48:41,655
Oh, yeah, that's it.

1065
00:48:48,157 --> 00:48:49,342
She smells good.

1066
00:48:52,066 --> 00:48:54,146
Smells real good.

1067
00:49:10,003 --> 00:49:12,820
When this is over,
I will kill you.

1068
00:49:12,885 --> 00:49:15,703
Yeah, yeah,
but it isn't over,

1069
00:49:15,768 --> 00:49:17,146
Is it, Neil?

1070
00:49:17,211 --> 00:49:18,939
No.

1071
00:49:19,004 --> 00:49:21,181
You be there
at 8:00.

1072
00:49:21,247 --> 00:49:23,038
Otherwise, you'll never see
either of them again.

1073
00:49:23,103 --> 00:49:25,024
Be where?
Be where at 8:00?

1074
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:26,786
The answer's
right here, Neil,

1075
00:49:26,851 --> 00:49:28,998
Staring you in the face.

1076
00:49:29,062 --> 00:49:30,983
You're hitting
the big time, now.

1077
00:49:31,048 --> 00:49:33,642
Let's see if you
can make it to the top.

1078
00:49:33,707 --> 00:49:34,986
What are you
talking about?

1079
00:49:35,083 --> 00:49:36,140
Why don't you
have a scotch

1080
00:49:36,205 --> 00:49:37,966
While you figure it out?

1081
00:49:39,121 --> 00:49:40,017
Neil!

1082
00:49:40,082 --> 00:49:41,426
Tell me where,
for Christ's sake!

1083
00:49:41,491 --> 00:49:43,027
Be where?

1084
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:44,692

You just want
your life back.

00:50:51,225 --> 00:50:53,467
What do you think?

1094
00:50:53,691 --> 00:50:55,132
Well,

1095
00:50:55,196 --> 00:50:56,828
Get out
of the car then.

1096
00:51:03,526 --> 00:51:04,517
Shit.

1097
00:51:12,558 --> 00:51:13,710
Hit the big time...

Tom: Missing you
already.

1111
00:52:49,936 --> 00:52:52,593
I made it.
I'm at the clock tower.

1112
00:52:52,658 --> 00:52:54,099
Too late.

1113
00:52:54,164 --> 00:52:55,669
No, no, no,
I did what you asked.

1114
00:52:55,733 --> 00:52:57,847
I--I--I got here.

1115
00:52:57,911 --> 00:52:59,705
You're too late.

1116
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:02,396
Jesus Christ.
What do you want from me?

1117
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:03,709
It's not all bad.

1118
00:53:03,773 --> 00:53:04,829
I'll let you say
good-bye.

1119

What? No, wait.

Baby, listen.

Neil, listen, he's got--

1123

Tom: Time's up.

1124
00:53:14,473 --> 00:53:16,746
W-where are you?

1125
00:53:16,811 --> 00:53:19,436
W-what are you
going to do?

1126
00:53:19,533 --> 00:53:21,358
Come and take
a look, Neil.

1127
00:53:23,601 --> 00:53:24,657
Where?

1128
00:53:24,755 --> 00:53:26,035
The edge, Neil.

1129
00:53:26,101 --> 00:53:28,564
Just step up to the edge
and look down.

1130
00:53:41,444 --> 00:53:42,692
Ok...Ok...

1131
00:53:42,757 --> 00:53:45,510
You're not scared,
are you?

1132
00:53:45,576 --> 00:53:46,632
A little bird
told me

1133
00:53:46,697 --> 00:53:48,457
You're not crazy
about heights.

1134
00:53:48,522 --> 00:53:49,546
I'm at the edge.

1135
00:53:49,611 --> 00:53:51,211
I'm at the goddamn edge!

1136
00:53:51,276 --> 00:53:53,231
Abby really wanted
one last look.

1137
00:53:53,295 --> 00:53:54,351
No, wait, wait.

1138
00:53:54,416 --> 00:53:55,472
But if you haven't
got the balls--

1139
00:53:55,538 --> 00:53:57,330
I can't even see you.

1140
00:53:57,395 --> 00:53:58,867
You're not
at the edge, Neil,

1141
00:53:58,933 --> 00:54:00,020
Or we'd see you.

1142
00:54:00,086 --> 00:54:01,046
I want
to see you standing.

1143

Wait, wait!

1144

Ok, ok, I--

1145
00:54:09,631 --> 00:54:11,425
I see you.

1146
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:12,482
Stand up, Neil.

1147
00:54:12,547 --> 00:54:13,634
Abby: No...

1148
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:15,269
Get up.
No.

1149
00:54:15,334 --> 00:54:16,230
Neil, get up.

1150
00:54:16,295 --> 00:54:17,639
Please,
don't do this.

00:54:37,211 --> 00:54:38,363
I'm here.

I'm...
[stammering]

1156
00:54:41,536 --> 00:54:43,071
Tell him to move back.
It's too dangerous.

00:54:43,138 --> 00:54:44,033
I'm on the edge.

1158
00:54:44,099 --> 00:54:45,315
[indistinct]

1159
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:47,012
Tell him to move back.
That's enough!

1160
00:54:47,078 --> 00:54:48,743
No, please,
he'll kill himself.

1161
00:54:48,839 --> 00:54:50,119
That's enough!
Listen to me!

1162
00:54:50,184 --> 00:54:52,041
[Tom grunts]
Abby: no!

1163
00:54:52,106 --> 00:54:53,259
Don't you touch her!

1164
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:54,380
Get in the car.

1165
00:54:54,444 --> 00:54:55,820
[Abby weeping]

1166
00:54:55,887 --> 00:54:56,782
Stay in here.

1167
00:54:56,848 --> 00:54:57,679
Stay in there.

[sobbing]

1169
00:55:00,113 --> 00:55:03,091
Listen, it doesn't matter
that you were late.

1170
00:55:03,157 --> 00:55:04,918
I was going
to have her anyway.

1171
00:55:05,015 --> 00:55:07,321
Only she
doesn't know that yet.

1172
00:55:10,428 --> 00:55:11,357
Neil:
why are you doing this?

1173
00:55:11,422 --> 00:55:13,791
Why are you
doing this to me?

1174
00:55:13,856 --> 00:55:16,739
Why? Why...

1175
00:55:19,046 --> 00:55:20,582
Haven't you seen it yet?

1176
00:55:20,646 --> 00:55:22,023
Huh, Neil?

1177
00:55:22,088 --> 00:55:23,528
What are
you talking about?

1178
00:55:23,594 --> 00:55:24,681
The answer is up there.

1179
00:55:27,021 --> 00:55:28,302
Ah, it's right there.

1180
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:30,736
Look around.

1181
00:55:30,801 --> 00:55:32,818
Where?

1182
00:55:32,882 --> 00:55:33,875
It's under your nose.

1183
00:55:33,939 --> 00:55:37,399
Come on, you want
to know why, don't you?

1184
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:43,485
Aah!

1185
00:55:52,166 --> 00:55:54,279
What does it mean?

1186
00:55:54,344 --> 00:55:56,617
Tom: I'll tell you
what it means.

1187
00:55:56,683 --> 00:55:59,566
It means
stamping out a problem.

1188
00:55:59,631 --> 00:56:01,295
Crushing it.

1189
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:03,473
So, now I've got
your daughter and your wife.

1190
00:56:05,619 --> 00:56:08,950
And you're just
a tiny dot in the sky

1191
00:56:09,016 --> 00:56:10,712
Worth nothing.

1192
00:56:10,777 --> 00:56:15,037
Please, no,
I'm begging you, don't.

1193
00:56:15,102 --> 00:56:18,047
And what exactly
am I going to do?

1194
00:56:18,112 --> 00:56:21,090
I'll leave that to
your imagination, Neil.

1195
00:56:21,186 --> 00:56:22,724
Don't you hang up!

1196
00:56:22,789 --> 00:56:23,812
Don't you hang up!

1197
00:56:23,877 --> 00:56:25,928
Sweet dreams.

1198
00:56:30,061 --> 00:56:32,365

[indistinct chatter]

1205
00:57:25,315 --> 00:57:26,884
Hey, whoa!
I need help.

1206
00:57:26,949 --> 00:57:28,005
Yeah, the line's
back there, sir.

1207
00:57:28,071 --> 00:57:29,415
No, this is
an emergency.

1208
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:32,075
My--my wife and child
have been kidnapped.

1209
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:33,674
There's a psycho out there,

1210
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:36,975
Ok, he--he's taken
my wife and my little girl.

1211
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,928
You got my car,
he's driving my car.

1212
00:57:39,025 --> 00:57:40,242
He--it's a range rover,

1213
00:57:40,307 --> 00:57:43,765
"r"-"u", uh, 83--83 "a."

1214
00:57:43,829 --> 00:57:45,494
And there--he's got
a woman who's helping him.

1215
00:57:45,559 --> 00:57:46,616
She's--

1216
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,089
Pretending
to be a sitter?

1217
00:57:48,155 --> 00:57:50,620
Randall, right?
Your name is Neil Randall?

1218
00:57:50,686 --> 00:57:51,646
Yeah.

1219
00:57:51,711 --> 00:57:53,694
I just spoke
to your wife.

1220
00:57:53,759 --> 00:57:55,713
She was here.
What?

1221
00:57:57,796 --> 00:57:58,789
W-wait, when?

1222
00:57:58,853 --> 00:58:00,518
About half
an hour ago.

1223
00:58:04,779 --> 00:58:05,772
You spoke--
you spoke to my wife?

1224
00:58:05,836 --> 00:58:07,085
Yeah.
She's ok?

1225
00:58:07,149 --> 00:58:08,365
She explained
the whole thing.

1226
00:58:08,431 --> 00:58:09,583
Ok.

1227
00:58:09,649 --> 00:58:10,865
She said that
you might show up

1228
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:12,562
With this story.

1229
00:58:12,627 --> 00:58:13,618
At the state
you're in,

1230
00:58:13,683 --> 00:58:14,900
You'll try anything
to stop her.

1231
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,449
Stop her doing what?

1232
00:58:19,515 --> 00:58:20,666
Leaving you.

1233
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:25,631
No, you don't
understand.

1234
00:58:25,697 --> 00:58:27,841
No, she's
not leaving me.

1235
00:58:27,907 --> 00:58:29,796
No, he made her
say that.

1236
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:31,333
Ok? He's got
the whole thing planned.

1237
00:58:31,399 --> 00:58:34,088
He's smart. Oh, he--
he's smart, all right.

1238
00:58:34,152 --> 00:58:36,426
He, uh--he's got
our daughter.

1239
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:38,668
And he's made us--
forced us to do

1240
00:58:38,734 --> 00:58:40,879
Everything he says.

1241
00:58:40,943 --> 00:58:43,121
Look, I get it.
I know how you feel.

1242
00:58:43,187 --> 00:58:45,459
My wife left me
a year ago

1243
00:58:45,524 --> 00:58:47,798
I went a bit--[clicks]
crazy myself.

1244
00:58:47,862 --> 00:58:49,783
I'm not some
jealous husband, all right?

1245
00:58:49,848 --> 00:58:52,570
I'm the victim
of a crime!

1246
00:58:55,582 --> 00:58:58,400
Look,
you've been drinking.

1247
00:58:58,466 --> 00:58:59,266
I'm not drunk.

1248
00:59:01,027 --> 00:59:03,110
He did this to me.

1249
00:59:03,175 --> 00:59:04,517
Do yourself a favor.

1250
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:07,113
Go home, sober up.

1251
00:59:07,178 --> 00:59:09,867
Try and accept it,
all right?

1252
00:59:09,932 --> 00:59:11,118
Nothing for me to do.

1253
00:59:11,182 --> 00:59:12,494
Can't help you.

1254
00:59:12,688 --> 00:59:13,968
All right?

1255
00:59:14,033 --> 00:59:15,057
Let's go,
I'll walk you out.

Oh, baby.
It's ok!

1262
01:00:44,076 --> 01:00:45,067
It's ok.
Are you ok?

1263
01:00:45,133 --> 01:00:46,379
He didn't touch me.

1264
01:00:46,446 --> 01:00:47,437
You promise me?

1265
01:00:47,567 --> 01:00:48,494
Yes, I promise.

1266
01:00:55,831 --> 01:00:57,463
He made me lie
to that cop.

1267
01:00:57,529 --> 01:00:59,417
I thought you were going
to fall off the building.

1268
01:00:59,482 --> 01:01:01,532
I thought you
were going to die.

1269
01:01:01,596 --> 01:01:02,589
Oh, baby.

1270
01:01:02,654 --> 01:01:03,870
Oh, baby
I thought I'd lost you.

1271

I thought--
[chokes]

1272
01:01:06,305 --> 01:01:07,328
I thought
I'd lost everything.

1273
01:01:07,395 --> 01:01:08,386
It's ok.

1274
01:01:08,452 --> 01:01:09,635
Remember that feeling!

1275
01:01:11,944 --> 01:01:13,639
'cause the next time
I tell you to do something

right?

Right, Mr. Randall?

Good, now we understand
each other.

Get in the back.

we just do it?

you're going yet?

Just tell us.

We're going where you
were going all along.

We're going
to meet the boss.

it had something

To do with work.

Maybe.

anything, anymore.

Just ease the way.

1302
01:03:34,038 --> 01:03:35,799
What do I tell him?

1303
01:03:35,863 --> 01:03:38,040
Just tell him the truth.

1304
01:03:40,123 --> 01:03:41,116
Get out.

1305
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:42,686

just do it.

Hey, Neil.

1310

There something
I forgot to ask you.

1311
01:04:16,992 --> 01:04:18,369
What?

1312
01:04:18,466 --> 01:04:20,196
How far
would you go?

1313

What?

1314
01:04:22,887 --> 01:04:25,256
To save the things
most important to you.

1315

How far?

1316
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:28,427
I would do
whatever it takes

1317
01:04:28,493 --> 01:04:29,740
To protect my family.

1318
01:04:29,806 --> 01:04:31,727
Yeah, I can
understand that.

And that's
a great thing.

1320
01:04:33,937 --> 01:04:34,834
There's this
one last thing

1321
01:04:34,898 --> 01:04:35,635
I want you to do.

1322
01:04:44,028 --> 01:04:44,796
Go on.

1323
01:04:50,434 --> 01:04:52,131
I want you
to kill, Neil.

1324
01:04:54,117 --> 01:04:55,942
You wanted to know
what this was all about.

1325
01:04:56,008 --> 01:04:58,313
Well, this is it.

1326
01:05:01,166 --> 01:05:03,534
No. You are crazy.

1327
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,783
I can't do that.

1328
01:05:04,848 --> 01:05:05,969
You don't have to.

1329
01:05:08,117 --> 01:05:10,390
But if you don't...

1330
01:05:10,454 --> 01:05:11,607
You'll never see
Sophie again.

1331
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:15,097
Because believe
one thing,

1332
01:05:15,162 --> 01:05:18,909
I don't give a damn
what happens to me.

I can't--I can't--

Neil, there's
no debate here, ok?

1335
01:05:23,331 --> 01:05:24,227
There's one person
in that house

1336
01:05:24,292 --> 01:05:25,252
And if they're not dead

1337
01:05:25,317 --> 01:05:26,726
In the next 10 minutes,

1338
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:27,463
Someone else will be.

1339
01:05:32,972 --> 01:05:35,567
Have you forgotten
that feeling already?

You scared the life

Judy?

1351
01:08:15,184 --> 01:08:17,329
I just took a shower.

1352
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:18,995
I was beginning to think
you weren't going to make it.

Mmm.

God, Neil,
you look awful.

1355
01:08:26,394 --> 01:08:27,579
What happened?

1356
01:08:29,502 --> 01:08:30,557
You were stuck with Abby
when you called,

1357
01:08:30,624 --> 01:08:31,519
Weren't you?

1358
01:08:31,681 --> 01:08:32,928
Is she ok?

1359
01:08:35,876 --> 01:08:37,189
Yeah.

1360
01:08:37,254 --> 01:08:39,463
She's ok.

1361
01:08:39,528 --> 01:08:40,616
Well, she bought
all that stuff

1362
01:08:40,682 --> 01:08:43,628
About going to Karl's,
didn't she?

1363
01:08:43,692 --> 01:08:45,773
Yeah, she trusts me.

1364
01:08:48,369 --> 01:08:49,585
Yeah.

1365
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:53,237
Anyways, let's get
this jacket off.

1366
01:08:53,431 --> 01:08:54,391
No, no.

1367

It's cold out there.

Ok.

01:09:01,278 --> 01:09:02,591
Well, come in
by the fire, then.

1371
01:09:06,244 --> 01:09:06,882

Yeah--yeah, thanks.

[bottle clinks]

So, how did you
find the place?

1375
01:09:18,638 --> 01:09:20,080
I thought you
were going to call.

1376
01:09:22,932 --> 01:09:24,533
I know what's wrong.

1377
01:09:24,598 --> 01:09:26,455
It's a long drive,

1378
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:28,696
Plenty of time
to discover a conscience.

Look, Neil, don't you
think I felt guilty, too?

1381
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:37,089
But we've had
all these months

1382
01:09:37,153 --> 01:09:39,330
Of watching our backs.

In the afternoons.

1385
01:09:42,983 --> 01:09:44,840
Now, finally,
we can just relax

1386
01:09:44,905 --> 01:09:46,443
And enjoy each other.

1387
01:09:46,508 --> 01:09:47,211
Right?

01:09:49,037 --> 01:09:50,639
I don't know.

Neil?

1391
01:09:58,936 --> 01:10:00,119
Look, have I done
something wrong?

1392

No.

[scoffs]

Well, then,
what is it?

1395
01:10:04,702 --> 01:10:05,629
It's nothing.

1396
01:10:05,694 --> 01:10:07,550
Well, it's got
to be something.

1397
01:10:17,291 --> 01:10:18,827
Who is that?

1398
01:10:20,364 --> 01:10:22,221
That's my husband
Tom.

1399
01:10:25,009 --> 01:10:26,066
I guess now
you can put a face

You know
where he is.

1404
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:35,772
He's on
that hunting trip.

That's why
we're here.

God, anyway, what's
with the sudden interest

1407
01:10:40,930 --> 01:10:42,499
In Tom?

You've never given
a damn before--

1409
01:10:43,653 --> 01:10:44,580
What do you think
he would do,

1410
01:10:44,645 --> 01:10:45,541
If he found out?

1411
01:10:45,606 --> 01:10:47,336
He's not going
to find out.

Just what would Tom do?

I don't know
what he'd do.

1414
01:10:51,115 --> 01:10:53,389
It would
destroy him.

talking about this?

Why would Tom
have Sophie? What--

about us!

You go to the gym,
you go home,

1485
01:13:59,817 --> 01:14:00,937
You pat your kid
on the head.

1486
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:02,667
You screw your wife.
Then you screw mine.

1487
01:14:02,732 --> 01:14:05,229
The end
of a perfect day.

It wasn't her
you were screwing,

01:14:14,008 --> 01:14:15,896
Was it? No.

1491

It was me.

01:14:21,151 --> 01:14:22,144
Huh?

1494
01:14:22,209 --> 01:14:24,033
So, come on, Neil.

01:14:24,097 --> 01:14:25,057
Kiss me, huh?

1496

What's going on?

01:16:26,812 --> 01:16:28,189
Huh, baby?
Are you all right?

1522
01:16:28,254 --> 01:16:29,886
We're getting
out of here.

Where is he?
It's over.

Please tell me
what's going on, Neil.

You were right.

1526
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,426
It was work. He had
a grudge against Karl.

1527
01:16:40,491 --> 01:16:41,738
So, what was Judy
doing in there?

1528
01:16:43,245 --> 01:16:44,270
What?

1529
01:16:44,335 --> 01:16:45,934
I thought I saw Judy
at the window!

Look, I told you,
didn't I?

Ok, it was work.

Yes, but what was
Judy doing there?

Look, it's complicated!

And?

Thought it was
with me.

No, what matters
right now is Sophie.

work this out together.

We can get through this

And I'll make it up
to you.

our daughter today.

And we have her back.

1606

They took Sophie.

And we--
did they?

1608
01:21:31,053 --> 01:21:32,751
But you know--

1609
01:21:34,641 --> 01:21:36,145
Well,
you know they did.

we're sorry.

1611

Your call cannot
be completed as dialed.

1612
01:21:38,870 --> 01:21:40,471
Please check the number

1613
01:21:40,536 --> 01:21:42,519
And dial again.

1614
01:21:42,584 --> 01:21:44,378
We know it's just
a game, honey.

1615
01:21:44,442 --> 01:21:46,813
Ok, just do whatever
the lady says, all right?

1616

Oh, Neil.

the house.

[bangs]

1619
01:22:06,545 --> 01:22:09,716
She had a nice day--

1620

With a lovely sitter.

1621
01:22:12,407 --> 01:22:14,681
I made sure
that I got the best.

1622
01:22:14,745 --> 01:22:16,603
Only the best.

1623
01:22:16,667 --> 01:22:18,492
You set me up.

1624
01:22:18,558 --> 01:22:21,056
You set me up
from the start.

1625
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:22,657
Little old me.

1626
01:22:24,291 --> 01:22:25,347
Can you believe it?

1627
01:22:29,961 --> 01:22:31,370
And you...

1628
01:22:31,434 --> 01:22:33,131
And you put me
through all of that?

1629
01:22:33,195 --> 01:22:34,348
How about this, Neil?

1630
01:22:34,412 --> 01:22:36,398
How about weeks
and months of knowing

1631
01:22:36,464 --> 01:22:38,416
You're not good enough?
Try that!

1632
01:22:40,787 --> 01:22:41,781
Abby!

1633
01:22:43,350 --> 01:22:46,040
It didn't
mean anything!

1634
01:22:46,104 --> 01:22:47,321
You gotta
believe me.

1635
01:22:47,387 --> 01:22:49,595
I do believe you.

1636
01:22:49,661 --> 01:22:52,318
I believe you.

1637
01:22:52,383 --> 01:22:55,008
But it meant
something to me.

1638
01:22:55,074 --> 01:22:56,803
And it meant
something to him.

1639
01:22:56,867 --> 01:22:59,205
Enough that you
would let him destroy

1640
01:22:59,271 --> 01:23:01,287
Every cent
we've worked for?

1641
01:23:01,353 --> 01:23:02,505
No, Neil.
Not every cent.

1642
01:23:14,902 --> 01:23:18,424
So, you just ruined
my career.

1643
01:23:18,650 --> 01:23:19,674
Did I?

1644
01:23:19,738 --> 01:23:21,276
Yes, I saw you
do that one, Abby.

1645
01:23:21,341 --> 01:23:23,166
And what
did you see, Neil?

1646
01:23:34,634 --> 01:23:36,137
None of it happened.

1647
01:23:36,204 --> 01:23:38,700
So you got it?
Yeah.

1648
01:23:38,765 --> 01:23:40,111
Quite a performance.

1649
01:23:50,649 --> 01:23:52,506
I found you out, Neil.

1650
01:23:52,572 --> 01:23:54,012
Just like I did
in Denver.

1651
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:00,258
I have been
in so much pain.

1652
01:24:02,759 --> 01:24:04,487
Do you know
how that feels?

1653
01:24:06,666 --> 01:24:10,380
Watching you
sleep at night,

1654
01:24:10,446 --> 01:24:12,207
Watching you dream.

1655
01:24:14,065 --> 01:24:15,633
And knowing that
she watches you, too.

1656
01:24:20,664 --> 01:24:22,617
[sighs]

1657
01:24:22,747 --> 01:24:23,739
I'm done.

1658
01:24:25,629 --> 01:24:27,582
I get you.
I understand you.

1659
01:24:29,761 --> 01:24:30,849
But I don't want you.

1660
01:24:33,958 --> 01:24:35,494
Look, you still have
everything.

1661
01:24:35,558 --> 01:24:37,096
You still have
your house,

1662
01:24:37,161 --> 01:24:38,184
You still have
your career,

1663
01:24:38,249 --> 01:24:39,178
You'll always have
Sophie.

1664
01:24:39,242 --> 01:24:41,100
Everything's exactly
as it was.

1665
01:24:44,207 --> 01:24:46,193
Except for one thing.

1666
01:24:47,954 --> 01:24:49,652
Who breaks a butterfly
on a wheel?

1667
01:24:52,793 --> 01:24:53,816
I do, Neil.

1668
01:24:58,558 --> 01:25:00,255
I just wanted
to share those feelings

1669
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:02,658
With you, if only
for a few hours.

1670
01:25:02,722 --> 01:25:06,501
Despair, loss,

1671
01:25:06,565 --> 01:25:09,320
Abandonment,

1672
01:25:09,385 --> 01:25:10,986
Betrayal.

1673
01:25:13,388 --> 01:25:14,765
Are they there, Neil?

1674
01:25:17,744 --> 01:25:18,994
Are they, baby?

1675
01:25:22,839 --> 01:25:24,022
Are they?

1676
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:45,030
