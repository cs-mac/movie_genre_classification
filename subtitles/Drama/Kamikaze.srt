1
00:00:57,292 --> 00:01:00,250
MONDAY

2
00:01:42,292 --> 00:01:44,250
We haven't got much time.

3
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:46,875
Take off your clothes, Slatan.

4
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:13,125
They're both ready.

5
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,625
But tomorrow, only one will go.

6
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,417
It's your decision.

7
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:23,375
I'll go.

8
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:24,667
I'll go.

9
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:28,417
Let luck decide.

10
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,250
Got a coin?

11
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,042
And you?

12
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:45,625
Should I go for change?

13
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:47,583
There's a supermarket.

14
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:48,958
No. How about you?

15
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,125
I haven't got anything.

16
00:02:51,292 --> 00:02:52,875
I found one.

17
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:55,875
Heads,

18
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:57,583
tails.

19
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:05,792
Slatan,

20
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:07,792
you win.

21
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,208
TUESDAY

22
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,833
Move slowly.

23
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:21,458
Act sure of yourself.

24
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,208
Make eye contact.

25
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,167
What if something goes wrong?

26
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:32,625
Wrong?

27
00:03:37,292 --> 00:03:38,500
What is your name?

28
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,625
My name is Slatan Sveraev.

29
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:42,833
Where are you traveling to?

30
00:03:43,042 --> 00:03:44,333
Spain.

31
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,500
- Why?
- Work.

32
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,083
Alicante, pharmaceutical.

33
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,208
The jacket you're wearing
has nothing metal.

34
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:02,667
The scanner won't detect
the explosives.

35
00:04:06,042 --> 00:04:08,042
Nothing will go wrong.

36
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,375
Are you carrying anything metal?

37
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:21,042
Oh, right.
It must be my wedding ring.

38
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,667
Remove your shoes.

39
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,250
What could I be carrying
in my shoes?

40
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:32,042
A machine gun? Plutonium?

41
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,000
What are you afraid of?

42
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,625
You must not be searched.

43
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,917
They cannot touch you.

44
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:42,750
What's wrong with you people?
This is disrespectful.

45
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:44,625
Why are you touching me?

46
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:49,625
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

47
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,542
You'll detonate the bomb
during takeoff.

48
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,458
Over the urban area.

49
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,250
With 90,000 liters of kerosene
in the tanks.

50
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:05,083
The metal components
of the detonator

51
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:08,000
will be hidden
in your personal objects.

52
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:20,167
There are two ways
to detonate the bomb.

53
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:26,625
The cord on your chest
detonates the bomb in your jacket.

54
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,125
If you're discovered,

55
00:05:30,292 --> 00:05:32,458
push the auxiliary button.

56
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,542
The bomb will explode
after four minutes.

57
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:39,542
Right when the cops
are all over you.

58
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,917
They will never take you alive.

59
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:52,375
The mix of explosives
is very sensitive.

60
00:05:56,917 --> 00:05:59,375
Humidity makes it unstable.

61
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,292
Do not drink.

62
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,417
Do not sweat.

63
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,292
If it gets wet, it will explode.

64
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:15,125
Act like a normal passenger.

65
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:19,000
Be friendly.

66
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:20,917
Alex!

67
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,333
Don't be a nuisance.

68
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,500
Sit down.

69
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,083
For years you've lived

70
00:06:28,292 --> 00:06:29,875
hidden like a dog

71
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,708
in Alicante.

72
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:35,917
Do you speak Spanish?

73
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,417
A little bit.

74
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:41,042
He's not completely deaf.
He has 6% hearing.

75
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,417
He had an accident at home.

76
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,458
They can operate when he's older.

77
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:47,542
Women...

78
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,625
will embroider your face
on clothing.

79
00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:54,500
Children...

80
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,583
will learn your name at school.
Slatan.

81
00:07:02,292 --> 00:07:06,292
All of Karadjistan is with you...

82
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:08,375
Where's your luggage, Sasha?

83
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:11,750
We agreed that if I didn't relapse,
we were going to Spain today.

84
00:07:11,917 --> 00:07:15,625
Your sacrifice
is the greatest act of love.

85
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,917
If I'm nuts, don't come with me.

86
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,125
Stay in this shitty city.

87
00:07:20,417 --> 00:07:22,000
It smells like a hospital!

88
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,000
If I'm nuts,
you shouldn't be with me!

89
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:27,250
- You're not well.
- Of course I'm not.

90
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,292
- I'm not going.
- Wait...

91
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,625
It's your time, Slatan.

92
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:34,583
You'll be a hero.

93
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,458
Sasha, please...
Give me another chance.

94
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:39,458
Please, don't leave me.

95
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,417
I'll kill myself.
I swear I will.

96
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,750
People will never forget you.

97
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,833
You're going to die for our people.

98
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,583
Russia has offended our honor...

99
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,000
...murdered our hope.

100
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:19,667
100 years of oppression are enough.

101
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,083
We will not hang our heads.

102
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:27,833
We will not forgive their insults.

103
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,792
We will never forget our fallen.

104
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:35,708
100 years of oppression are enough.

105
00:08:36,292 --> 00:08:39,417
All of our enemies will die.

106
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,667
They will die.

107
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,875
They will die!

108
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,708
Excuse me. Thank you.

109
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:52,250
Excuse me.

110
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:55,625
The Chinese make everything
their size.

111
00:08:58,625 --> 00:08:59,625
Let's see...

112
00:08:59,917 --> 00:09:01,083
Here we are.

113
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,333
Pardon me.

114
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:15,500
I just married this pretty
little mouse sitting beside you

115
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,292
and they gave us separate seats.

116
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,958
Would you mind sitting here
in my seat?

117
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,750
I'll change seats.

118
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,000
- Really? You don't mind?
- Not at all.

119
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:25,625
Thank you.

120
00:09:32,292 --> 00:09:34,667
Do you speak Castilian?
Spanish, do you speak Spanish?

121
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:35,625
A little.

122
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:37,417
I saw you in Customs...

123
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:40,417
They checked everything
but my rectum. They're psychotic

124
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,000
about terrorism, Jesus.

125
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:43,083
It's crazy.

126
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,208
Hold on.

127
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,042
The seatbelt.

128
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:51,792
Where's the...?

129
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:53,625
Wait...

130
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,750
Oh, that's yours.

131
00:09:55,917 --> 00:09:56,667
You're right.

132
00:09:56,917 --> 00:09:58,375
Good lord.

133
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,875
My God.

134
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,417
Geez, it's hot.

135
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:05,208
"What to do in case of an accident."

136
00:10:05,417 --> 00:10:07,292
Preparing us for the worst.

137
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:11,583
The wings on Russian planes
are stapled on.

138
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:15,542
Never fails.
Accident, Russian plane...

139
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:22,125
Two anti-anxiety pills
and a prayer...

140
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,667
and we'll be in Madrid.

141
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,625
I'm Eugenio Sanardy.
Eugene.

142
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,000
Slatan Sveraev.

143
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:31,083
Nice to meet you.
Russian?

144
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:33,917
Sorry, they spilled...

145
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:35,167
- There.
- Yes.

146
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,458
All set.

147
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,042
Thanks.

148
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,125
We're going to spend
more than 6 hours together.

149
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:43,667
A lot of marriages
don't last that long.

150
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,583
- Oh, newlyweds. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

151
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,875
- Honeymoon in the Caribbean.
- Yeah?

152
00:10:49,042 --> 00:10:50,375
Who could ask for more?

153
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:52,583
After two years living in Moscow.

154
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:55,958
- Hooray for the newlyweds.
- Hooray.

155
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,458
What's wrong?

156
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:15,750
What's going on?
I told you.

157
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,792
Russian plane.
Something defective.

158
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:22,667
Technical problem?

159
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,542
It smells like gasoline.

160
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:45,625
Your attention, please.

161
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,625
The flight has been cancelled
due to the storm.

162
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:57,958
The passengers who need lodging
will be taken to a hotel.

163
00:11:58,292 --> 00:12:00,417
But due to the number
of cancellations,

164
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:03,458
it's possible
the hotel will be out of town.

165
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,250
What time will the plane leave
tomorrow?

166
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,792
We'll pick you up at ten, sir.
Have your luggage ready.

167
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:16,167
Enjoy your stay.

168
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,917
Damn Russian music.

169
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:44,458
I can't believe it!
What are you doing here?

170
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,667
- It's a mistake.
- My room.

171
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:47,792
No, my room!

172
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,625
Okay, it'll be our room.

173
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:55,292
Seated together, sharing a room...
It's destiny.

174
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,000
- How about that!
- How about what?

175
00:14:58,167 --> 00:15:00,625
No, I mean...
What's your trade, pal?

176
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,667
Your job.
What do you do?

177
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,458
I sell medicine.

178
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,750
We're practically colleagues.

179
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:08,625
I sell shoes.

180
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,167
Nothing like a good shoe
for a healthy body.

181
00:15:15,292 --> 00:15:16,208
Look.

182
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,417
Check these out.

183
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:21,708
Not bad, huh? Ladies shoes.
You know why?

184
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,625
Know what my slogan is?

185
00:15:24,792 --> 00:15:26,875
So comfortable
even a man can wear them.

186
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,458
No blisters,
never a damn chilblain.

187
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,208
Sanardy Shoes change your life.

188
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,583
I have some with me, look.

189
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:37,625
Yeah, springs.

190
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,750
Russian hotels still don't use
bed frames.

191
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,083
Like sleeping in a bird cage.

192
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,042
Don't move.

193
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,250
Why not?

194
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,958
Because... my bed.

195
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,833
Okay.

196
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:55,125
I'm going to the can.

197
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,875
Hi, it's Slatan.

198
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,208
I'm in a hotel.

199
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:42,292
Are you crazy?
They'll trace the call!

200
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,292
Hang up, you idiot!
Hang up!

201
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:45,708
Hang up! Hang UP!

202
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:53,833
WEDNESDAY

203
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:04,792
Hi.

204
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,417
Hi.

205
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,958
I need some razors.

206
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:13,625
- Razors?
- Yeah.

207
00:17:14,042 --> 00:17:18,875
The storm caught me off guard...
and I want to shave my legs.

208
00:17:20,042 --> 00:17:21,750
Shave. One moment.

209
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,333
Razors.

210
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,625
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

211
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:30,167
Excuse me.

212
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:31,708
Excuse me.

213
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,083
Good morning.

214
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:40,000
When are they taking us
to the airport?

215
00:17:40,417 --> 00:17:42,375
It probably won't be today.

216
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:45,083
The forecast is snow, snow...

217
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,792
and more snow!

218
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,292
Okay.

219
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:56,500
I'd like to change rooms,
to a single.

220
00:17:56,667 --> 00:17:58,667
All the rooms are shared.

221
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:02,042
This is a small hotel. It isn't
prepared for so many guests.

222
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:03,542
I'm sorry.

223
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,042
Good morning!

224
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:16,042
Any problems with the snow
last night?

225
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,042
Please try to understand.

226
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,042
Ruskie!

227
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,292
Come here.

228
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,833
You can sit by me.

229
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,917
Come on.
He didn't hear me.

230
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:31,375
There's no oatmeal?
A kiwi?

231
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:32,750
Something healthy.

232
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,833
What do you mean, I can't cancel?
<i>7</i> thousand euros!

233
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,167
- Sorry...
- No, no...

234
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:39,833
Please, ladies first.

235
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,458
- Thank you.
- Miss, are you lame?

236
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:44,125
I'm trapped in Russia.
Russia!

237
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,500
How should I know what time
I'm getting to Puerto Vallarta?

238
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:48,500
Say you'll be there
at a quarter to.

239
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,250
Have them put some champagne
on ice.

240
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:52,333
Like hell I'm going to pay
the honeymoon suite.

241
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,333
I am being polite,
just don't fuck with me.

242
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,375
It's my honeymoon!
Once in a lifetime!

243
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,750
I won't send shit in writing!

244
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,000
Pinhead!

245
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:02,625
Thief!

246
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:05,083
You're corrupt!

247
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,000
I'm sorry, I can't talk right now.

248
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,125
I don't know what's happening.

249
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,583
I can't stop laughing!

250
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,583
Finished?

251
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,542
What's a lady with such
a great sense of humor

252
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:24,625
doing in the Russian steppe?

253
00:20:24,792 --> 00:20:26,458
I was at a funeral.

254
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,417
My husband's.

255
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,458
Mmm, tasty.

256
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,292
Hi.

257
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:36,583
Hi.

258
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,625
What happened to your wrist?

259
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:41,583
Nothing.

260
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:44,917
I cut myself on a bottle
of perfume.

261
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,583
Clumsy me!

262
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,167
Here we are,
the whole Spanish colony.

263
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,375
And it looks like
for a while.

264
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:54,083
We should do something tonight
for entertainment.

265
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,250
Alex!

266
00:20:55,417 --> 00:20:58,208
Karaoke? Getting laid is pretty
unlikely.

267
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,333
Maestro, you play the piano,
right?

268
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,417
I've called the company
85 times already.

269
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,542
I talked to a machine that...

270
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,292
Camilo, what's your problem?

271
00:21:10,542 --> 00:21:13,125
- Sorry, my love.
- You think this is normal?

272
00:21:13,292 --> 00:21:14,583
Have you seen my son?

273
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,750
Always the same.

274
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,958
I turn around and he takes off.

275
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:22,208
Alex!

276
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,042
He was playing in the snow.

277
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,875
Hold him for a second, okay?

278
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,208
Wait...!

279
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,542
That was you

280
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:19,625
outside the door
in the bathroom, right?

281
00:22:22,292 --> 00:22:24,042
It wasn't a bottle of perfume.

282
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:29,667
You know what?

283
00:22:36,417 --> 00:22:38,625
If you really want to cut vein,

284
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:42,250
you have to cut vertical.

285
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:46,542
And zigzag.

286
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,167
So they can't stitch.

287
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:56,250
Then you get in bathtub
with hot water.

288
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:00,750
There you can go...

289
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:03,167
very peacefully.

290
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,667
Okay.

291
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:12,542
Can you watch baby?

292
00:23:14,708 --> 00:23:15,417
Yes.

293
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,667
Get out of here.

294
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:33,208
Out!

295
00:24:24,917 --> 00:24:27,167
Knowing that I loved you,

296
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:31,083
that you were my joy
and my blazing dream.

297
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:35,792
It's too late to comfort me.

298
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,500
That's why I get drunk

299
00:24:41,667 --> 00:24:44,208
to forget

300
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:46,417
yourlove.

301
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:49,833
Bravo!

302
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:53,042
What's going on?

303
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:54,250
Karaoke night.

304
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:55,625
Who wants to try?

305
00:24:56,042 --> 00:24:58,750
Come on, my shoes are full of swing.

306
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,500
That's it!

307
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,625
Ruskie! How about it?

308
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:05,917
Sing us something.

309
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,583
We're in your land.

310
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,750
Sing something
from Mother Russia.

311
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:11,625
You want a little help?

312
00:25:11,792 --> 00:25:12,667
Maestro?

313
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:13,875
Hit it.

314
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:31,583
Ravil!

315
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:39,583
The storm has intensified
with a low pressure polar front.

316
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:42,875
In the next 48 hours o
we expect lows of -32C

317
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:47,625
along with strong winds
and heavy snow.

318
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,958
Oh, good.

319
00:26:58,542 --> 00:27:00,125
There's a little left.

320
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:02,333
Bring it over.

321
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:05,000
Keep the party 90mg-

322
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:10,375
Lola, if you want to go to bed,
that's okay.

323
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:13,500
What? I have a babysitter for once.

324
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,708
I left them with the Argentinean.

325
00:27:15,917 --> 00:27:19,125
He'll dance them right to sleep!

326
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:27,417
Tell me, sweetie...
What brought you to Russia?

327
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:37,958
Want me to show you?

328
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,958
Where is there a telephone?

329
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:00,750
Here.

330
00:28:05,542 --> 00:28:06,542
No...

331
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,833
ls there a public telephone
anywhere around here?

332
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:17,292
I feel like going for a walk
to get the blood flowing.

333
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:21,375
It's 3O degrees below zero outside

334
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,625
and the nearest village

335
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:27,583
is 9 kilometers to the north.

336
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:29,583
To the north.

337
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:32,417
Thanks.

338
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:05,625
- You looked beautiful.
- There we are.

339
00:29:05,792 --> 00:29:08,000
Six months after meeting
in Torrevieja.

340
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:13,917
"Listen to me, Dolores.
Do you find me attractive?

341
00:29:15,042 --> 00:29:15,917
Well, honey?"

342
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:18,833
He should try a little sun block!

343
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,208
His face looks like
a monkey's ass!

344
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:24,500
"It's not the sun,
I'm red from the vodka.

345
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:26,333
From the liquor.

346
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,000
From the brandy.

347
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:29,667
From drinking anything."

348
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,167
Go on, put your tie
on your head, Boris.

349
00:29:33,417 --> 00:29:34,458
Look, look!

350
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:38,500
"This is as calm

351
00:29:38,667 --> 00:29:42,583
as you'll see me
in the next 8 years.

352
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:46,833
Everyone listen to me.
The Spanish girl married a Russian.

353
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,958
And she thinks
that because I'm old

354
00:29:49,125 --> 00:29:51,125
I'll treat her with respect
and dignity.

355
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:52,833
Well, I won't.

356
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,000
I will leave her

357
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:56,292
with two children.

358
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,250
Without a single orgasm,

359
00:29:59,417 --> 00:30:03,125
not a penny to her name
and with marks on her body.

360
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,125
With this open hand

361
00:30:06,292 --> 00:30:08,750
I'll beat her for 8 years,

362
00:30:08,917 --> 00:30:10,625
her and her children.

363
00:30:11,292 --> 00:30:12,917
And if one of them goes deaf,

364
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:16,833
too bad.

365
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,042
That's life."

366
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:30,917
My wrist could have really used

367
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:33,958
one of your broken bottles
of perfume.

368
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,625
What rotten luck.

369
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:41,292
Such a pretty young girl
cutting herself like that.

370
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:45,000
Lucky it wasn't serious.

371
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:37,875
We can't take your call
at the moment.

372
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:39,583
Please leave a message.

373
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:41,250
It's Slatan.

374
00:33:44,833 --> 00:33:46,917
This phone is safe.

375
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:50,000
The plane has been delayed
a few days by the storm.

376
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:52,458
If I don't receive instructions,

377
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:55,250
I'll blow myself up
at the Limbads Hotel.

378
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,708
I repeat.

379
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:01,250
Loan kill...

380
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:06,625
I can kill 20 or 3O people.

381
00:34:10,958 --> 00:34:12,292
For Karadjistan!

382
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:23,792
THURSDAY

383
00:34:40,167 --> 00:34:41,417
Go away!

384
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:47,542
Go away!

385
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:53,500
Dog...

386
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:05,333
Easy“.

387
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:11,792
Good boy.

388
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:30,250
Stay there.

389
00:35:32,583 --> 00:35:33,708
Stay.

390
00:35:56,208 --> 00:35:57,208
Eugene.

391
00:35:57,833 --> 00:35:59,167
Your roommate,

392
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,625
the Russian...

393
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:01,750
He never talks.

394
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,833
No, he's a little shy.

395
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:07,083
I'm calling from

396
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,667
room 104, Slatan Sveraev.

397
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:12,625
- Has anyone called me?
- One moment.

398
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:16,000
No, you have no calls.

399
00:36:23,917 --> 00:36:27,000
Shy? I would say anti-social.

400
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:29,167
He doesn't even say hi to people.

401
00:36:30,542 --> 00:36:32,667
Alex, honey, wipe your face.

402
00:36:33,833 --> 00:36:35,833
Stop teaching them gross things.

403
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:39,083
Let's not judge Slatan
for not saying hi once.

404
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:42,375
It's not only that.
He kind of scares me.

405
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:45,917
Not just his appearance,
it's the look in his eye.

406
00:36:52,417 --> 00:36:53,625
What look?

407
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:55,458
Listen.

408
00:36:56,583 --> 00:37:00,958
Dragging my ass across the world
for 3O years has taught me 2 things:

409
00:37:01,167 --> 00:37:02,458
The first...

410
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:04,333
Sanardy Shoes
make you walk better.

411
00:37:04,583 --> 00:37:05,708
That...

412
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:10,500
Russia has offended our honor,

413
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:12,875
murdered our hope.

414
00:37:13,042 --> 00:37:14,083
The second:

415
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,333
How to know people.

416
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:20,042
You look at the Russian
and what do you see?

417
00:37:20,292 --> 00:37:22,292
He doesn't wear Christian Dior,

418
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,292
his cell phone is out of credit...

419
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:28,167
he doesn't go around telling jokes
in the hallway...

420
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:31,333
100 years of oppression are enough.

421
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,708
And you know why?

422
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:35,958
Because something tragic
happened to him.

423
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:38,125
Something is wrong
and he carries it inside.

424
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:39,708
He doesn't sleep.

425
00:37:39,917 --> 00:37:41,833
He spends the whole night

426
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,917
pacing back and forth,
consumed by his anguish.

427
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:50,542
Maybe he never talks,
that's true.

428
00:37:51,292 --> 00:37:52,583
But he listens.

429
00:37:53,542 --> 00:37:55,167
So what?
Is that weird?

430
00:38:00,792 --> 00:38:02,750
Maybe we're the ones
who are weird.

431
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,292
We let him eat breakfast
alone in a corner.

432
00:38:24,167 --> 00:38:25,583
For Karadjistan!

433
00:38:31,458 --> 00:38:32,583
For my people!

434
00:38:33,167 --> 00:38:34,750
Slatan Sveraev!

435
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:38,917
Your call.

436
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:41,458
Your call.

437
00:38:45,417 --> 00:38:46,500
Slatan?

438
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:50,000
We heard your message.

439
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,208
The mission is still on.

440
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:56,833
You must blow up the plane
in flight.

441
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,917
Until then, behave like
a normal passenger.

442
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:04,083
- Understood?
- Understood.

443
00:39:10,208 --> 00:39:12,000
For your people, Ruskie.

444
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:15,542
- For your people, Slatan.
- For your people.

445
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:16,917
For your people.

446
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:20,250
Thank you.

447
00:39:22,958 --> 00:39:24,292
Thank you.

448
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:38,083
He is a little weird.
Just a little.

449
00:39:51,958 --> 00:39:54,292
I saved this for you,
or the Chinese will eat it.

450
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,333
You have a button loose.

451
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,917
Take off your coat,
I'll mend it for you.

452
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:00,750
We hear you're buying breakfast.

453
00:40:00,958 --> 00:40:01,875
Nice touch!

454
00:40:05,167 --> 00:40:06,375
We're keeping you company.

455
00:40:06,542 --> 00:40:07,875
I'll trade you this cookie.

456
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,333
These are delicious.

457
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:12,958
Here's to you, Slatan.

458
00:40:15,917 --> 00:40:18,500
He's scratching his head a lot.

459
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:19,667
So is he.

460
00:40:21,917 --> 00:40:22,875
What?

461
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,625
My God, look at all those
split ends.

462
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:33,000
I think you got lice
from the boy.

463
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:36,833
Lola. How about a ride
in my convertible?

464
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,125
Oh, a sled! Okay. I'll put up
my hair like Grace Kelly.

465
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:43,625
As long as we don't end up
like her.

466
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,042
Okay, you two are on your own.

467
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,125
Where are you going?

468
00:40:55,042 --> 00:40:56,000
Qkay...

469
00:40:56,667 --> 00:41:00,792
By the way, my name is Anunciacién,
but everyone calls me Nancy.

470
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,417
After the doll.

471
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:07,083
I'm Slatan Sveraev.

472
00:41:07,417 --> 00:41:08,500
Nice to meet you.

473
00:41:10,625 --> 00:41:12,208
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes.

474
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:46,542
Wait, it won't rinse out.

475
00:41:47,083 --> 00:41:48,167
Sorry.

476
00:41:49,958 --> 00:41:51,458
I need your help.

477
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:54,875
Hold the towel with your hand.

478
00:42:00,792 --> 00:42:03,208
It's very pretty.
What does "nadezhda" mean?

479
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:07,458
Hope.

480
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:11,750
Hope?

481
00:42:14,458 --> 00:42:16,458
Wow, the Ruskie is sensitive.

482
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:20,167
Ready.

483
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,042
Up.

484
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:27,833
Parted in the middle, on the side
or shoulder-length?

485
00:43:09,667 --> 00:43:11,292
Hold on, Lola.

486
00:43:12,458 --> 00:43:14,667
Hold on tight
or you'll go flying.

487
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:17,417
This thing is a rocket
going down the hill.

488
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:21,208
Trust me, Lola, don't hold back.
Come on.

489
00:43:21,708 --> 00:43:22,750
That's it.

490
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:26,417
Go with the flow,
you're with an expert.

491
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:32,125
Our trip was insured, right?

492
00:43:32,292 --> 00:43:35,167
You should send an SUV
or a damn tank for us.

493
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:39,458
Mr. Garrido, I'm going to take
legal action.

494
00:43:40,792 --> 00:43:42,417
<i>Satan, watch out...</i>

495
00:43:42,542 --> 00:43:44,458
We're almost there,
one last push.

496
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,125
You look very handsome.

497
00:43:53,792 --> 00:43:56,375
Who does your hair, Slatan?

498
00:43:58,208 --> 00:44:00,583
You're dangerous with scissors, huh?

499
00:44:06,375 --> 00:44:07,500
You know what?

500
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:14,125
A lot of people have tried
to dissuade me from killing myself.

501
00:44:15,542 --> 00:44:17,833
But nobody had ever
given me advice

502
00:44:18,375 --> 00:44:22,083
about how to do it
painlessly.

503
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:27,458
That's very nice.

504
00:44:31,417 --> 00:44:32,833
Thank you, Slatan.

505
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,625
You're welcome.

506
00:44:40,458 --> 00:44:41,625
Sorry! Hold on!

507
00:44:46,375 --> 00:44:47,458
Watch out!

508
00:44:57,125 --> 00:44:58,042
Eugene!

509
00:45:03,417 --> 00:45:06,292
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yes, yes.

510
00:45:06,458 --> 00:45:08,542
That was quite an impact!

511
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:12,458
Just a scare.
It looked worse than it was.

512
00:45:12,792 --> 00:45:16,000
Hey, Ruskie.
I have a question for you.

513
00:45:16,208 --> 00:45:18,125
I need to ask him something.

514
00:45:18,375 --> 00:45:21,000
Listen... Come with me...

515
00:45:26,292 --> 00:45:27,750
I broke my balls.

516
00:45:28,042 --> 00:45:29,917
- Look at me.
- What are you doing?

517
00:45:30,083 --> 00:45:32,250
Is everything
where it should be?

518
00:45:32,417 --> 00:45:34,917
It was like an explosion,
a crunch...

519
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:36,583
I felt something burst.

520
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,708
- I'm coming, okay?
- Take a look.

521
00:45:38,958 --> 00:45:39,792
Please.

522
00:45:42,583 --> 00:45:43,375
Well?

523
00:45:48,083 --> 00:45:50,250
What the fuck am I doing here?

524
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:52,542
Should I put it on ice?

525
00:46:25,792 --> 00:46:27,042
What's wrong?

526
00:46:27,208 --> 00:46:28,208
Get out.

527
00:46:28,375 --> 00:46:30,583
What's wrong?
If you have a problem, so do I.

528
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:33,625
I must dry medicine,
need to keep warm.

529
00:46:33,792 --> 00:46:37,000
Problem of life or death.

530
00:46:38,708 --> 00:46:39,458
Don't worry.

531
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:47,000
Please, everyone come out here.
The Ruskie has a problem.

532
00:46:47,208 --> 00:46:49,708
We need to dry his medicine.
We need heat.

533
00:46:49,917 --> 00:46:51,917
- A hair dryer.
- I have a heater.

534
00:46:52,083 --> 00:46:53,167
Please.

535
00:46:55,208 --> 00:46:56,958
- A hair dryer?
- Please.

536
00:46:57,125 --> 00:46:58,750
- I have an extension cord.
- Sure.

537
00:46:58,917 --> 00:47:01,000
- I have an electric blanket!
- Get it.

538
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,250
My hair dryer!

539
00:47:14,167 --> 00:47:15,458
It's dry.

540
00:47:46,458 --> 00:47:48,125
What a mess.

541
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:50,500
Right, dog?

542
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:07,667
I have a theory about heels
on shoes.

543
00:48:08,083 --> 00:48:11,625
Yes, I think the height is related
to a woman's problems.

544
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,083
Two centimeters, few problems.

545
00:48:14,583 --> 00:48:17,500
Eight centimeters,
a ton of problems.

546
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:21,583
I love them!

547
00:48:22,083 --> 00:48:24,917
Thank you very much.
They're beautiful.

548
00:48:25,458 --> 00:48:26,917
How high would yours be?

549
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,625
Fifteen...

550
00:48:28,792 --> 00:48:30,625
-at least.
- Good lord.

551
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,583
I don't think I have any...

552
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:43,500
Have you got family?

553
00:48:44,667 --> 00:48:45,500
Divorced.

554
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:51,042
Well, in Argentina getting divorced
is required for citizenship.

555
00:48:51,292 --> 00:48:53,542
It's in the Constitution.

556
00:48:54,667 --> 00:48:57,458
Selling shoes
in three countries a week...

557
00:48:58,083 --> 00:49:00,750
Well, you don't get home late.
You're never there.

558
00:49:03,125 --> 00:49:06,000
Maybe I married the wrong person.

559
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:07,958
Me too.

560
00:49:09,458 --> 00:49:12,208
So I decided to run away
with my children.

561
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:16,083
But the day right before
I got on the plane...

562
00:49:16,417 --> 00:49:17,583
he goes and leaves me.

563
00:49:19,417 --> 00:49:21,333
Myocardial heart attack.

564
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,542
He drank vodka
like chocolate milk.

565
00:49:24,375 --> 00:49:25,667
I don't know...

566
00:49:25,958 --> 00:49:27,583
He's upstairs, in the room.

567
00:49:28,542 --> 00:49:30,375
- Here?
- His ashes.

568
00:49:30,542 --> 00:49:31,833
In the room.

569
00:49:45,167 --> 00:49:46,458
Here we go!

570
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:49,792
Press 1 if you'd like to buy
an airline ticket.

571
00:49:49,958 --> 00:49:51,083
No.

572
00:49:51,375 --> 00:49:54,000
Press 2 if you'd like to speak
to check in.

573
00:49:54,167 --> 00:49:56,125
Not on your fucking life.

574
00:49:56,292 --> 00:49:59,083
Press 3 if you'd like to buy
insurance.

575
00:49:59,417 --> 00:50:01,792
Which later turns out to be useless.

576
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:05,500
Explain the reason you're calling
briefly and clearly.

577
00:50:05,667 --> 00:50:06,917
Need flight.

578
00:50:07,417 --> 00:50:10,583
We did not understand you.
Please repeat.

579
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,667
That damn Crematorium...

580
00:50:28,417 --> 00:50:32,042
They vacuum seal the urn
and I can't...

581
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:33,792
Please.

582
00:50:39,792 --> 00:50:41,250
A tool of my trade.

583
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:47,083
Sorry.

584
00:50:51,958 --> 00:50:54,208
This will be weird for him.

585
00:50:54,375 --> 00:50:56,333
All that ice and so little vodka.

586
00:50:59,083 --> 00:51:00,958
Did you want to say
a few words?

587
00:51:01,667 --> 00:51:02,750
Fuck him.

588
00:51:03,458 --> 00:51:04,333
Amen.

589
00:51:29,542 --> 00:51:31,083
He said 89.

590
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:33,333
Here we go. 43.

591
00:51:33,542 --> 00:51:35,125
Wait, wait, wait.

592
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:46,583
I wanted...

593
00:51:47,458 --> 00:51:50,583
to thank you
because you helped me...

594
00:51:51,292 --> 00:51:52,583
It was nothing, son.

595
00:51:52,833 --> 00:51:54,000
Here, sit down.

596
00:51:54,208 --> 00:51:55,083
Come on.

597
00:51:56,458 --> 00:51:58,833
We have 33...

598
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:00,458
Let's do this:

599
00:52:01,333 --> 00:52:03,500
How about you turn the lever

600
00:52:04,333 --> 00:52:06,042
-and say the number out loud.
- Go on.

601
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:08,750
Here we go!

602
00:52:09,833 --> 00:52:12,875
I'm having a bad streak.

603
00:52:14,875 --> 00:52:15,750
Here, let me.

604
00:52:15,917 --> 00:52:17,167
Are you sure?

605
00:52:17,375 --> 00:52:19,250
- No, but...
-Okay.

606
00:52:19,625 --> 00:52:22,500
- He's all yours.
-53.

607
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:25,167
In Russian, please.

608
00:52:27,542 --> 00:52:28,667
53.

609
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,708
This feels like...

610
00:52:31,917 --> 00:52:34,708
-a vacation. It's funny.
- It is.

611
00:52:34,917 --> 00:52:36,042
At least for me.

612
00:52:39,667 --> 00:52:42,458
He always does that every time!

613
00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:43,875
Well, well...

614
00:52:44,042 --> 00:52:46,458
- Did he get you wet?
-It's holy water.

615
00:52:46,583 --> 00:52:48,083
- Holy water, he says!
- Sure.

616
00:52:48,292 --> 00:52:48,917
Silly.

617
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:50,292
72.

618
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:57,250
Who said I couldn't fly a kite
at 20 below?

619
00:52:57,917 --> 00:53:02,292
We've done everything
but play smash ball.

620
00:53:02,458 --> 00:53:03,500
Right, honey?

621
00:53:04,208 --> 00:53:05,208
Slatan.

622
00:53:05,375 --> 00:53:09,083
Give me a <i>22</i> and we'll run away
with the winnings.

623
00:53:09,542 --> 00:53:10,417
Okay?

624
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:11,875
Let's go, bingo!

625
00:53:12,292 --> 00:53:14,292
Who has the bingo cards?

626
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:17,083
- We'll play together.
- Are you having fun?

627
00:53:17,958 --> 00:53:20,458
Tell me. Are you enjoying
your honeymoon?

628
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:22,708
Because while I eat shit
on the phone

629
00:53:22,875 --> 00:53:25,500
all you do is play with dessert,
your kite, the snowman

630
00:53:25,667 --> 00:53:27,583
and all the other crap!

631
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:33,667
We have nothing in common.

632
00:53:36,458 --> 00:53:39,208
I married a little boy
who'll never grow up.

633
00:53:41,792 --> 00:53:43,417
Grow up? What for?

634
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:47,250
To be unhappy, like you?

635
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:51,458
Because you seem very sad to me,
Natalia.

636
00:53:54,458 --> 00:53:55,750
You know what the problem is?

637
00:53:57,292 --> 00:53:59,875
The honeymoon wasn't the reason
I got married.

638
00:54:01,083 --> 00:54:02,708
You are.

639
00:54:03,458 --> 00:54:05,417
And you choose where the sun

640
00:54:06,208 --> 00:54:07,708
and the beach are.

641
00:54:07,875 --> 00:54:10,750
That's Russia for you.
Plenty of sun and beach.

642
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:13,375
That's how it is.

643
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:16,375
Russian cuisine is good,
that's true.

644
00:54:16,542 --> 00:54:17,750
Yes, excellent.

645
00:54:17,917 --> 00:54:20,875
Ruskie, let's make a goulash
for everyone tonight.

646
00:54:21,708 --> 00:54:24,333
We can make Chinese food too.

647
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:27,417
We'll find out if it's true
the Chinese eat each other.

648
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,292
I'm kidding.

649
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,458
Where's your friend?

650
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:35,958
How about it, Ruskie?
Let's cook.

651
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:39,625
Goulash, goulash, goulash!

652
00:54:39,792 --> 00:54:40,750
Goulash!

653
00:54:40,917 --> 00:54:42,458
Goulash, goulash!

654
00:54:49,917 --> 00:54:51,375
I'm not from Russia!

655
00:54:53,542 --> 00:54:56,167
I'm not from Russia, Eugene.
I'm from Karadjistan.

656
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,833
Karadjistan. Do you know
where that is on a map?

657
00:55:04,375 --> 00:55:05,333
No.

658
00:55:06,792 --> 00:55:09,375
My people were crushed by Russia.

659
00:55:11,042 --> 00:55:12,833
And they exiled us.

660
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,708
They cut our electricity,
communications.

661
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,167
Power.

662
00:55:17,917 --> 00:55:19,042
Food!

663
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:25,042
Did the United Nations
do anything?

664
00:55:27,167 --> 00:55:28,125
No.

665
00:55:28,833 --> 00:55:31,125
Domestic problem, they called it.

666
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:34,958
Nothing is what your countries do.

667
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,625
They do nothing.

668
00:55:45,333 --> 00:55:47,542
And after years of embargo...

669
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,458
nothing is left.

670
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,625
No hospital.

671
00:55:54,583 --> 00:55:57,042
No medicine. No antibiotic.

672
00:55:57,917 --> 00:56:00,042
Children die and diarrhea.

673
00:56:02,667 --> 00:56:04,875
And then bombing start.

674
00:56:12,292 --> 00:56:13,458
Ravil!

675
00:56:30,167 --> 00:56:31,000
Slatan.

676
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:32,833
Slatan.

677
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:34,750
Slatan.

678
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:37,792
Slatan, I need you in the hall.
It's urgent.

679
00:56:38,042 --> 00:56:39,375
Please, hurry.

680
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:41,667
Camilo!

681
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:42,708
What?

682
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:44,625
We have to wait?

683
00:56:45,542 --> 00:56:46,750
Half an hour?

684
00:56:47,833 --> 00:56:49,042
Please. Please.

685
00:56:49,292 --> 00:56:52,875
Alex, Lola's son, ran off into
the woods. It's been half an hour.

686
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:55,208
- Let's do a sweep.
- We need to hurry.

687
00:56:55,333 --> 00:56:58,208
-It's 3O below.
- My boy won't hear us.

688
00:56:58,333 --> 00:57:01,708
But he'll see us.
Don't worry, we'll find him.

689
00:57:01,958 --> 00:57:03,333
- Oh my God.
- Here.

690
00:57:03,917 --> 00:57:05,792
No, I'm not going.

691
00:57:05,958 --> 00:57:07,750
What? Weren't you listening?

692
00:57:07,917 --> 00:57:10,125
A 7-year-old boy
is freezing to death.

693
00:57:14,542 --> 00:57:18,792
I'm not going. 30 below zero.
Boy is dead.

694
00:57:21,333 --> 00:57:22,333
Lola...

695
00:57:22,833 --> 00:57:23,958
Lola!

696
00:57:25,958 --> 00:57:27,792
How can you say that?

697
00:57:28,292 --> 00:57:30,958
I thought I knew people.
I don't know shit.

698
00:57:35,542 --> 00:57:36,417
Go on.

699
00:57:39,417 --> 00:57:40,417
Go.

700
00:57:43,333 --> 00:57:44,708
You know something?

701
00:57:45,042 --> 00:57:47,125
You should get another tattoo

702
00:57:47,292 --> 00:57:49,958
that says there is no hope.

703
00:57:50,458 --> 00:57:53,875
Because there's a little boy
alone out there in the snow

704
00:57:54,042 --> 00:57:56,250
waiting for his mother
to find him.

705
00:57:56,375 --> 00:57:58,833
And he's going to die
like a little bird.

706
00:57:59,083 --> 00:58:00,208
You know?

707
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:02,042
You don't care.

708
00:58:04,958 --> 00:58:07,042
You're dead, Slatan.
You're dead.

709
00:58:09,708 --> 00:58:12,000
And you don't know
how sorry I am.

710
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:27,458
Alex!

711
00:58:29,125 --> 00:58:30,042
Alex!

712
00:58:52,708 --> 00:58:54,333
Mauthausen.

713
00:58:54,542 --> 00:58:56,500
1944.

714
00:58:58,042 --> 00:59:00,125
I know what you were
talking about in there.

715
00:59:00,375 --> 00:59:04,375
The bombing, the killing,
the horror...

716
00:59:07,458 --> 00:59:10,708
I can't complain. I'm alive.

717
00:59:11,833 --> 00:59:13,250
Mom, Dad...

718
00:59:14,958 --> 00:59:17,375
My five brothers and sisters.

719
00:59:17,708 --> 00:59:20,542
They all ended up getting cremated.

720
00:59:22,042 --> 00:59:24,417
Some nights I still dream about

721
00:59:24,917 --> 00:59:28,458
the smell coming out
of the smokestacks.

722
00:59:31,333 --> 00:59:33,583
The smell of Mom and Dad.

723
00:59:40,042 --> 00:59:43,417
Son, no matter how much
you've suffered,

724
00:59:43,833 --> 00:59:46,750
there's always someone
who suffers more than you.

725
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:47,667
Always.

726
00:59:52,583 --> 00:59:53,833
Alex!

727
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:32,458
Find!

728
01:00:33,208 --> 01:00:34,250
Slatan?

729
01:00:37,833 --> 01:00:39,042
Slatan!

730
01:00:42,042 --> 01:00:43,083
Slatan!

731
01:00:44,333 --> 01:00:45,333
Slatan...

732
01:00:47,667 --> 01:00:48,667
Slatan...

733
01:00:49,167 --> 01:00:50,417
Where are you going?

734
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:56,542
Boy look for sound of quarry.
That way.

735
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:03,958
Alex!

736
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:05,500
Where are you?

737
01:01:08,125 --> 01:01:09,708
Alex!

738
01:01:11,583 --> 01:01:13,208
Alex!

739
01:01:19,333 --> 01:01:20,333
Alex!

740
01:01:29,292 --> 01:01:30,792
Please, no...

741
01:01:34,375 --> 01:01:36,083
Please, no...

742
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,042
Oh, my baby...

743
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:13,375
My baby...

744
01:02:24,292 --> 01:02:26,000
Thank you... Thank you...

745
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:27,458
Thank you...

746
01:03:27,625 --> 01:03:28,625
Look.

747
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:31,917
Ravil.

748
01:03:34,667 --> 01:03:36,333
He's very handsome.

749
01:03:37,583 --> 01:03:38,708
Yeah.

750
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:42,375
He took a long time
to come into this world.

751
01:03:43,917 --> 01:03:47,583
He didn't want to leave
his mother's belly.

752
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:49,000
Smart, huh?

753
01:03:54,042 --> 01:03:58,125
Neighbor had to come
to help with birth.

754
01:03:59,375 --> 01:04:02,167
They had to cut her open
to take out.

755
01:04:04,125 --> 01:04:05,083
No doctor,

756
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:06,833
no hospital...

757
01:04:10,583 --> 01:04:13,542
My wife died during the birth.

758
01:04:13,917 --> 01:04:15,708
But Ravil lived.

759
01:04:16,042 --> 01:04:17,708
And he didn't cry.

760
01:04:22,958 --> 01:04:25,583
Here we went to Kostani.

761
01:04:26,792 --> 01:04:27,833
Kostani?

762
01:04:29,417 --> 01:04:33,042
And I told him
that if he got lost,

763
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:35,458
not to move.

764
01:04:35,708 --> 01:04:40,417
To stay where he was,
that Daddy would find him again.

765
01:04:40,583 --> 01:04:41,542
You know?

766
01:04:43,083 --> 01:04:46,667
And he looked at me
with face he made

767
01:04:48,042 --> 01:04:49,667
and went like this:

768
01:04:53,333 --> 01:04:55,542
When he did that everything...

769
01:04:57,250 --> 01:05:00,458
I knew everything would be okay.

770
01:05:00,625 --> 01:05:01,792
You know?

771
01:05:04,375 --> 01:05:06,042
And he got lost.

772
01:05:09,542 --> 01:05:11,458
And at 11:30...

773
01:05:12,333 --> 01:05:15,000
M-15 started bombing
like always.

774
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:17,958
I lost Ravil...

775
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:21,542
He was good boy.

776
01:05:21,833 --> 01:05:23,250
He didn't move.

777
01:05:26,792 --> 01:05:28,792
In the middle of square.

778
01:05:29,542 --> 01:05:31,042
Waiting.

779
01:05:31,417 --> 01:05:34,333
He held duck very tight.

780
01:05:35,125 --> 01:05:36,333
Tight.

781
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:39,083
Very, very tight,

782
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:41,167
like holding him...

783
01:05:41,333 --> 01:05:44,875
would keep him in world
of the living.

784
01:05:50,833 --> 01:05:51,958
But no.

785
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:04,208
- Don't cry.
- No, I'm not crying.

786
01:06:04,833 --> 01:06:06,125
It's just...

787
01:06:23,333 --> 01:06:25,167
Good night, Nancy.

788
01:06:27,333 --> 01:06:28,667
You mean good morning.

789
01:07:36,292 --> 01:07:39,458
FRIDAY

790
01:07:58,542 --> 01:08:00,042
Don't be like that.

791
01:08:00,208 --> 01:08:03,042
It's a Christmas sweater
from Santa Claus.

792
01:08:03,792 --> 01:08:05,958
Your clothes are in tatters.

793
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:08,583
Nancy and the rest of us
all chipped in...

794
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:10,250
Why don't you shut up
a little?

795
01:08:10,417 --> 01:08:11,625
Give me a hug.

796
01:08:13,167 --> 01:08:15,875
Take it easy, man, come on.
That's it.

797
01:08:17,333 --> 01:08:20,333
Thank you. Really.
For what you did

798
01:08:20,458 --> 01:08:23,208
for the boy.
I misjudged you at first,

799
01:08:23,792 --> 01:08:26,792
but I care about Lola and the boys
very much and...

800
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,625
We stayed up all night talking...

801
01:08:29,833 --> 01:08:32,167
"Pim, pum, pam..."
Until dawn.

802
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:33,958
-"Pim, pum, pam?"
- What?

803
01:08:34,125 --> 01:08:36,917
Mpim, pum, pam?"
- No, no...

804
01:08:37,292 --> 01:08:40,208
No, talking, really.
She's a wonderful woman.

805
01:08:40,333 --> 01:08:42,292
I see love here!

806
01:08:42,417 --> 01:08:43,333
- No, no...
- What?

807
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:46,667
It would be crazy.
We live on different continents.

808
01:08:48,083 --> 01:08:49,250
Come on.

809
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,792
Look at him run!

810
01:08:58,167 --> 01:08:59,042
Bravo!

811
01:09:04,792 --> 01:09:05,750
Thank you!

812
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:09,958
Hero!

813
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:11,708
Brave!

814
01:09:11,917 --> 01:09:13,042
How are you?

815
01:09:13,667 --> 01:09:14,708
Are you okay?

816
01:09:19,417 --> 01:09:20,333
He's okay.

817
01:10:08,542 --> 01:10:09,542
Bravo!

818
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:20,625
Okay, we can let the lovebirds
go back to their honeymoon

819
01:10:20,833 --> 01:10:22,208
and keep the party going.

820
01:10:22,333 --> 01:10:24,708
Who wants to give it a try?
Come on!

821
01:10:25,667 --> 01:10:28,792
Slatan, sing a song from Rajistan,
from your country.

822
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:30,500
Yeah, come on!

823
01:10:31,417 --> 01:10:33,250
- Let's hear it!
- I don't want...

824
01:10:33,375 --> 01:10:34,292
Sing!

825
01:10:34,458 --> 01:10:36,417
Sing! Sing!

826
01:10:37,542 --> 01:10:39,542
Everybody settle down.

827
01:10:39,875 --> 01:10:41,125
Singing isn't Slatan's style.

828
01:10:41,333 --> 01:10:42,333
But yes,

829
01:10:42,542 --> 01:10:44,750
- I can sing a song for you.
- Okay.

830
01:10:47,125 --> 01:10:48,000
Okay.

831
01:10:48,417 --> 01:10:49,583
Come on!

832
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:51,708
I can't believe it!

833
01:10:51,958 --> 01:10:52,917
Let's go!

834
01:10:54,542 --> 01:10:55,833
I can't believe it!

835
01:11:01,708 --> 01:11:03,208
Let's go, my friend.

836
01:11:03,458 --> 01:11:05,208
The stage is yours, Slatan.

837
01:11:05,375 --> 01:11:08,042
- I only know one.
- Then sing that one.

838
01:11:08,208 --> 01:11:10,208
- Or sing another one.
- Stud!

839
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:21,625
Russia has offended our honor,

840
01:11:21,792 --> 01:11:25,208
murdered our hope.

841
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:29,667
100 years of oppression are enough.

842
01:11:30,042 --> 01:11:32,958
We will not hang our heads.

843
01:11:33,667 --> 01:11:36,542
We will not forgive their insults.

844
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:40,458
We will never forget our fallen.

845
01:11:41,542 --> 01:11:44,500
We will fight the enemies
who strangle us.

846
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:47,417
We will fight to the end!

847
01:11:48,167 --> 01:11:49,458
To the end!

848
01:11:52,417 --> 01:11:54,583
The enemy will die.

849
01:11:54,792 --> 01:11:56,000
The enemy will die.

850
01:11:56,208 --> 01:11:59,167
All of our enemies will die.

851
01:11:59,333 --> 01:12:01,792
They will die, they will die,
they will die.

852
01:12:02,292 --> 01:12:03,583
Our country

853
01:12:04,125 --> 01:12:06,042
we will free.

854
01:12:06,208 --> 01:12:10,667
We will never give in
to the enemy.

855
01:12:10,958 --> 01:12:12,333
Quiet!

856
01:12:12,958 --> 01:12:13,875
Quiet.

857
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:24,458
Russia has offended our honor,

858
01:12:25,083 --> 01:12:29,500
murdered our hope.

859
01:12:30,292 --> 01:12:35,083
100 years of oppression are enough.

860
01:12:35,667 --> 01:12:38,208
We will fight to the end.

861
01:12:38,833 --> 01:12:41,792
Russia has offended our honor,

862
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,042
murdered our hope.

863
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:48,458
100 years of oppression are enough.

864
01:12:48,625 --> 01:12:50,708
All of our enemies will die.

865
01:12:51,625 --> 01:12:52,750
They will die!

866
01:12:53,333 --> 01:12:55,750
They will die!

867
01:12:57,958 --> 01:12:58,875
Bravo!

868
01:13:14,792 --> 01:13:16,292
Is that tasty?

869
01:13:23,333 --> 01:13:25,125
Well, dog...

870
01:13:27,125 --> 01:13:29,083
How are you doing?

871
01:14:00,292 --> 01:14:03,042
The airport will be opening
in one hour.

872
01:14:06,625 --> 01:14:10,375
The bus outside will take you
to the international terminal.

873
01:14:20,042 --> 01:14:22,417
The plan is still on.

874
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:24,083
As we agreed.

875
01:14:25,167 --> 01:14:26,417
Is that clear?

876
01:14:27,708 --> 01:14:28,833
It's clear.

877
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:32,250
You...

878
01:14:32,833 --> 01:14:36,708
You're a rock star, Slatan.

879
01:14:37,958 --> 01:14:40,583
You're the man, Slatan.

880
01:14:40,833 --> 01:14:43,458
The fucking king.
Holy shit.

881
01:14:43,667 --> 01:14:45,500
Forget about Bon Jovi.

882
01:14:45,792 --> 01:14:47,042
Spaniard...

883
01:14:47,708 --> 01:14:50,958
When we get back to Madrid,
set up a concert!

884
01:15:05,583 --> 01:15:08,833
For you this has been
a mountain holiday.

885
01:15:09,292 --> 01:15:12,083
- Your mission ends here.
- No.

886
01:15:15,083 --> 01:15:19,792
You can go back to your family.
They're waiting for you.

887
01:15:24,292 --> 01:15:26,417
Tell your parents

888
01:15:29,583 --> 01:15:31,500
that you'll be home for dinner.

889
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:38,292
And your wife Yedé will be there,
celebrating your return.

890
01:15:43,458 --> 01:15:45,542
You must be eager to see...

891
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:49,042
your son Ravil

892
01:15:50,042 --> 01:15:52,125
after all this time.

893
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,125
Of course I want to see
my son Ravil.

894
01:16:19,458 --> 01:16:20,750
And I Will.

895
01:16:29,333 --> 01:16:30,917
Everything is fine.

896
01:16:33,583 --> 01:16:35,000
Don't worry.

897
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:12,417
Come on, we're leaving!

898
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,917
The rickety bus is here!

899
01:17:15,083 --> 01:17:16,375
Let's go!

900
01:17:16,542 --> 01:17:17,833
Excuse me...

901
01:17:19,042 --> 01:17:20,958
Bye-bye Russia!

902
01:17:21,125 --> 01:17:22,375
Here we go!

903
01:17:22,542 --> 01:17:24,458
The best honeymoon!

904
01:17:24,667 --> 01:17:25,958
The Caribbean is overrated.

905
01:17:26,125 --> 01:17:27,167
Slatan...

906
01:17:27,583 --> 01:17:29,542
I was looking for you.

907
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,042
What...?

908
01:18:15,208 --> 01:18:17,125
It's just a little cold.

909
01:18:17,333 --> 01:18:21,375
The 3O below zero will make him
stronger. Like an Eskimo.

910
01:18:22,833 --> 01:18:24,500
What's the plan
when you get there?

911
01:18:25,583 --> 01:18:29,667
Well... my sister is picking me up
at the airport after all.

912
01:18:30,167 --> 01:18:33,167
Just as well.
Because with the baby

913
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:34,958
-and stroller...
- Yes.

914
01:18:35,125 --> 01:18:36,458
And the bus to Madrid...

915
01:18:37,833 --> 01:18:38,958
And you?

916
01:18:42,083 --> 01:18:43,417
Run around, as usual.

917
01:18:43,583 --> 01:18:45,208
- All over the place.
- Right.

918
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:46,667
- Eugene.
- Yes?

919
01:18:46,833 --> 01:18:48,667
Sorry. Something's wrong
with Slatan.

920
01:18:48,833 --> 01:18:51,542
He's been in the bathroom
for 20 minutes.

921
01:18:51,708 --> 01:18:53,750
After the fajitas the other day,

922
01:18:53,875 --> 01:18:55,083
I'm not surprised...

923
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:56,542
Excuse me.

924
01:18:57,292 --> 01:18:58,125
Lola.

925
01:18:58,458 --> 01:19:00,083
Go ahead and board.

926
01:19:12,667 --> 01:19:13,833
What is it?

927
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:15,750
What's wrong with him?

928
01:19:19,667 --> 01:19:20,875
What is that?

929
01:19:24,667 --> 01:19:26,000
It's a bomb!

930
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:27,458
Eugene!

931
01:19:30,208 --> 01:19:31,667
Son of a bitch.

932
01:19:32,125 --> 01:19:34,833
You said it was medicine
and it's a bomb.

933
01:19:38,583 --> 01:19:40,500
There's a terrorist
in the airport.

934
01:19:40,833 --> 01:19:41,708
We don't understand.

935
01:19:48,542 --> 01:19:49,708
Say it's not true.

936
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:03,417
They don't trust me.

937
01:20:03,917 --> 01:20:05,083
What? What's wrong?

938
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:06,833
There's another terrorist.

939
01:20:08,833 --> 01:20:09,833
Eugene“.

940
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:12,042
Understand?

941
01:20:13,583 --> 01:20:14,583
Where are you going?

942
01:20:15,167 --> 01:20:16,250
Eugene!

943
01:20:16,417 --> 01:20:17,167
Eugene“.

944
01:20:17,958 --> 01:20:19,083
Eugene, I swear...

945
01:20:20,208 --> 01:20:21,792
I swear on my son Ravil

946
01:20:22,125 --> 01:20:24,333
that you aren't wrong about me.

947
01:20:24,583 --> 01:20:26,500
Andrei, come over here.
They only speak Spanish.

948
01:20:26,667 --> 01:20:30,250
There's more medicine
on the plane...

949
01:20:30,542 --> 01:20:32,208
What's the problem?

950
01:20:35,917 --> 01:20:36,792
Dad?

951
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:39,875
He's my father.

952
01:20:40,042 --> 01:20:42,000
He's not well.

953
01:20:42,667 --> 01:20:43,458
Everything's fine.

954
01:20:44,125 --> 01:20:46,208
They'll catch the terrorist, okay?

955
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:49,250
Are you wearing Mom's shoes again?

956
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:50,458
Sorry.

957
01:20:55,375 --> 01:20:57,917
He'll try to detonate bomb
in the air.

958
01:20:58,083 --> 01:21:00,208
We have to disarm him
before we take off.

959
01:21:00,417 --> 01:21:05,125
He has a detonator on his chest
and delay button in his hand.

960
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:11,417
If he sees any police or notices
anything strange, he won't hesitate.

961
01:21:11,958 --> 01:21:13,625
He'll blow himself up.

962
01:21:15,625 --> 01:21:18,000
So we have to do it
by ourselves.

963
01:22:13,792 --> 01:22:15,542
Pardon me, sir.

964
01:22:17,708 --> 01:22:20,458
I just married
this pretty little mouse...

965
01:22:20,875 --> 01:22:22,333
and they gave us separate seats.

966
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:24,583
Would you mind changing seats?

967
01:22:24,875 --> 01:22:25,708
Excuse me.

968
01:22:26,208 --> 01:22:27,750
I'll change with you.

969
01:22:27,917 --> 01:22:29,625
Okay, yeah.

970
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:45,375
Young people
still get married, huh?

971
01:22:45,917 --> 01:22:49,375
They don't know what comes after.
Break-ups, lawyers...

972
01:22:49,583 --> 01:22:50,833
A total bust.

973
01:22:51,125 --> 01:22:52,625
Hooray for the newlyweds!

974
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,625
Here, let me hold him.

975
01:22:58,333 --> 01:23:00,167
Let me hold him,
see if he calms down.

976
01:23:03,208 --> 01:23:04,958
Come here...

977
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:07,208
It's okay, come here...

978
01:23:07,417 --> 01:23:08,208
Come on.

979
01:23:08,833 --> 01:23:13,167
Just as I thought, a full nappy.
Let's change you.

980
01:23:14,208 --> 01:23:16,000
Do you need some help?

981
01:23:16,167 --> 01:23:17,833
- It looks like it.
- Thanks.

982
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,500
It's not easy in a plane.

983
01:23:19,667 --> 01:23:21,292
I'm good with kids.

984
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:23,292
Yeah, they love me.

985
01:23:31,583 --> 01:23:32,833
Here we go...

986
01:23:36,833 --> 01:23:38,000
That's it...

987
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:44,542
Here, take him...

988
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:47,125
Sorry...

989
01:23:47,292 --> 01:23:48,125
Easy“.

990
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:50,542
He's a baby.

991
01:24:03,792 --> 01:24:04,417
Slatan!

992
01:24:29,375 --> 01:24:30,208
Slatan...

993
01:24:30,583 --> 01:24:32,417
- Hold him tight.
- Are you okay?

994
01:24:32,583 --> 01:24:34,000
- Nancy.
- What?

995
01:24:34,333 --> 01:24:36,917
He pressed delay button.

996
01:24:37,542 --> 01:24:38,833
What does that mean?

997
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,625
That bomb will explode
in 4 minutes.

998
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:50,625
Slatan, what are you going to do?

999
01:24:52,042 --> 01:24:53,917
Get the bomb out of here.

1000
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:02,333
Tell the captain to stop the plane
or it will explode.

1001
01:25:02,542 --> 01:25:03,708
- Slatan, don't!
- Oh my God...

1002
01:25:04,583 --> 01:25:07,500
Take emergency positions
and lean forward.

1003
01:25:10,292 --> 01:25:12,375
- I'm not letting go.
- Nancy...

1004
01:25:12,875 --> 01:25:15,208
There's a bomb on board.
I repeat...

1005
01:25:16,208 --> 01:25:18,167
- Nancy...
- I'm not letting go...

1006
01:25:18,333 --> 01:25:20,292
I go wherever you go.

1007
01:25:20,458 --> 01:25:22,083
- You can't come!
- Yes!

1008
01:25:22,625 --> 01:25:25,167
Get it out of here...
Everyone...

1009
01:25:25,333 --> 01:25:26,458
Sound the alarm!

1010
01:25:34,042 --> 01:25:34,833
Are you okay?

1011
01:25:39,917 --> 01:25:42,083
We have to start over.

1012
01:25:42,375 --> 01:25:44,792
Start over in Russian prison?

1013
01:26:43,333 --> 01:26:44,083
Stop!

1014
01:26:45,083 --> 01:26:46,542
I said stop!

1015
01:26:48,333 --> 01:26:50,167
Stop, you scum!

1016
01:26:54,417 --> 01:26:56,375
Get down on the ground!

1017
01:26:58,625 --> 01:27:01,000
I said get down on the ground!

1018
01:27:16,875 --> 01:27:19,042
Hands on your head!

1019
01:27:44,792 --> 01:27:46,708
Go away, dog.

1020
01:27:47,083 --> 01:27:48,625
Go away. No!

1021
01:27:49,542 --> 01:27:50,458
Go away!

1022
01:27:50,833 --> 01:27:51,833
Go!

1023
01:27:57,625 --> 01:27:58,958
Get away from me!

1024
01:28:04,833 --> 01:28:07,333
Prepare to fire!
Stop or we'll shoot!

1025
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:10,583
Stop!

1026
01:28:10,875 --> 01:28:11,875
Get away!

1027
01:28:12,292 --> 01:28:13,833
First and second, fire!

1028
01:29:01,875 --> 01:29:03,750
I'm his girlfriend!

1029
01:29:08,375 --> 01:29:10,000
If you die, I'll kill you.

1030
01:29:11,208 --> 01:29:13,292
If you die, I'll kill you...

1031
01:29:14,208 --> 01:29:18,833
You told the police
you're my girlfriend?

1032
01:29:19,333 --> 01:29:20,125
Yeah.

1033
01:29:21,667 --> 01:29:22,500
Yeah.

1034
01:29:23,292 --> 01:29:27,292
I finally find a good man and look
what trouble you get yourself into.

1035
01:29:29,625 --> 01:29:31,250
Don't talk now.

1036
01:29:41,792 --> 01:29:43,083
It will be okay.

1037
01:29:43,333 --> 01:29:44,292
Yes.

1038
01:30:00,417 --> 01:30:01,208
Slatan!

1039
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:05,667
Sorry. Sorry.

1040
01:30:05,833 --> 01:30:07,958
- Sorry.
-It's okay.

1041
01:30:25,875 --> 01:30:26,833
Take it.

1042
01:30:37,375 --> 01:30:38,250
Slatan!

1043
01:30:38,792 --> 01:30:41,667
What did one terrorist say
to the other terrorist?

1044
01:30:42,625 --> 01:30:44,542
This is gonna be a blast!

1045
01:30:54,208 --> 01:30:55,125
Slatan!

1046
01:30:58,292 --> 01:31:01,083
There's always someone
who suffers more than you.

1047
01:31:01,375 --> 01:31:03,542
And you only have two choices:

1048
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,083
Either rot inside,

1049
01:31:06,917 --> 01:31:10,583
or dance to the rhythm of life.

1050
01:31:55,667 --> 01:31:59,333
SATURDAY
