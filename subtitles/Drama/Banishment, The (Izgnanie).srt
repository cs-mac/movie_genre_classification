1
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:38,708
THE BANISHMENT

2
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,757
- I'm going to call a doctor.
- No.

3
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,910
- Mark, you need a doctor.
- I need you to try hard and pull it out.

4
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,670
Do you hear me? Just pull the 
bullet out and I'm gone.

5
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,237
I'll sleep for a while...
and then... I'm gone.

6
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,909
I don't want to have
your family seeing me.

7
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,669
Come on. Come on. Come on.

8
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,749
What about you?

9
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,953
- I'll leave in few days.
- For how long?

10
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,756
For a couple of months.
Robert found me a job.

11
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,236
- Good money?
- Good enough.

12
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,916
I might get to buy a car.

13
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,477
Why don't you sell father's house? It's
just sitting there uninhabited anyway.

14
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,079
- I might sell it or I might not.
- Would you like to go there?

15
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,395
- No.

16
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,151
- I'm thirsty.
- We're almost there. Hang on.

17
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,114
Come here, Eva.

18
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,114
- What is it, mom?
- Take these in your room and set them on the bed.

19
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,592
- And come back quickly.
- Yes ma'am.

20
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,433
Dad, where is the walnut orchard?

21
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,154
Up on the hill.

22
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,311
- Will we go there after we wash?
- We'll go.

23
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,877
- I want a walnut from the tree.
- I think they're still green
and cannot be eaten.

24
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,630
- We can eat them.
- I want a walnut from the tree!

25
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:56,393
- Dad, why isn't there water in the spring?
- God knows why!

26
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,713
- Did it dry out?
- It seems like it.

27
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:19,319
It was flowing right through here,
underneath the house. Draining into the bluff.

28
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,271
Did you see that?

29
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,551
I did.

30
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,553
Bunny, give me an apple.

31
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,953
- My name is Eva.
- I know. I named you.

32
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,310
You said Bunny!

33
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:54,075
Because you're like a little bunny.
A blond bunny... Like a sunbeam.

34
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,159
I don't want to be Bunny.
I want to be Eva.

35
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,389
All right Eva, give me an apple.

36
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,276
- Would you like salad with apples in it?
- No, I don't want that.

37
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,437
What would you like then?

38
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,873
Nothing.

39
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,678
I'm sorry, Mom.
I won't do it again.

40
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,918
Don't say that, my love.
It's not your fault.

41
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,748
Why did you run out?

42
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,589
- What happened, Vera?
- Nothing.

43
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,796
I see.

44
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,595
That's it! Go to sleep.

45
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:28,551
- Dad, what's that smell?
- I don't know.

46
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,272
- Go to sleep.
- Good night.

47
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,635
Would you like a drink?

48
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,432
With pleasure. I really need a drink.

49
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,950
Alex...

50
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,914
I'm pregnant.

51
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,674
It's not yours.

52
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,874
You want a ride?

53
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,836
I know who you are.

54
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,996
You are Alexander.
I'm Max, Georgy's son.

55
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,430
Do you remember me?
I am a mailman, in the city.

56
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,394
- I came to your house.
- I don't remember.

57
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,637
If you'll excuse me.
I don't feel like talking.

58
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,557
Mark, I'm at the train station.
We need to talk.

59
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,596
Which train station?

60
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,030
- Ok. Let's talk...
- No, I'm coming over.

61
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,355
There's no more trains at this time.

62
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,358
I'll find a car.

63
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,673
I'll wait for you down at the bar. Or at the casino.
It's right next door.

64
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,950
I know.

65
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,515
- Max, can we talk for a minute?
- Yes.

66
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,558
- Can you let me have your car tonight?
- Sure.

67
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,673
Where should I leave it?
At your house?

68
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,553
Leave the keys inside the glovebox.

69
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,833
Alex...

70
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,030
Be quiet.

71
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,994
Hello, Viktor? This is Alexander.

72
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:01,148
Yes. I got here yesterday.
A week or so.

73
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,313
OK. We'll do it that way.
Come over today by five.

74
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,034
Yes. Of course.

75
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,469
OK. See you soon.

76
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,639
How do you like it here?
Does it look changed?

77
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,797
Everything looks the same.

78
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,551
Kir! Eva! Come here!

79
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:42,234
- How long has been since you left? 10 Years?
- Twelve.

80
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,796
How's Mark doing?
Do you see your brother?

81
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,990
He's fine.

82
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:54,591
What about his family?
Is he at least seeing his children?

83
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:00,590
- I don't know.
- Your father missed them a lot.

84
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,474
- Did he ever see your children?
- No.

85
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,112
You can hardly get you or Mark to talk.

86
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:16,395
He comes, locks himself inside
the house and lives like a monk.

87
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:23,596
People used to live different.
Everything seemed to be all right but...

88
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,559
You never know what's going to happen.

89
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:33,708
Dad, I want to sit next to you.

90
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:45,470
We'll get there in 3 minutes.

91
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,558
You may go there.

92
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:06,031
Kir, let's go!
I want to introduce you to somebody.

93
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:30,474
- What's his name?
- He has no name. Would you like to name him?

94
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:39,115
- May I ride him?
- Not yet. Let him grow up more.

95
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,028
When is he going to be grown enough?

96
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,153
Next time you come back.

97
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,398
- You like it here, don't you?
- Yes.

98
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,718
- Good boy.
- Good boy.

99
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,555
Let's go to my place.

100
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,151
Alex...

101
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,711
- I was thinking...
- Why didn't you think before you did it?

102
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:59,870
Listen. Now that I've thought...
I hoped that you could...

103
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,959
Could what? Could what?

104
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,315
Do you love him?

105
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:16,349
- I don't know how to explain it to you.
- You don't know?

106
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,517
You don't know how to explain?

107
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:54,749
27, 28, 29, 30...
Ready or not, here I come!

108
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,271
- Eva is behind the tree.
- You cheated. You peeked.

109
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:12,474
- It's not true.
- It's not fair.

110
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:23,631
We can't hide inside the house.
We agreed not to!

111
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,670
Faina! Faina!

112
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,470
I got here first.

113
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,837
Go find Flora.

114
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:59,557
Soon Flora will turn ten, Frida eleven,
and Fayna is already twelve.

115
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:05,755
Mine wants no more children, 
but I should give him a boy.

116
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,678
What are your plans?

117
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:14,158
You should have one more.
Three is the magic number.

118
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,356
Flora?

119
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,430
Vera? What do we have for dinner?

120
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:43,510
Everything is ready.
It just needs to be brought to the table.

121
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,236
- Why don't you hide?
- I do hide.

122
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:04,071
- You don't hide for real. You went too far.
- I know.

123
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:11,516
- Don't you want to play?
- I do, but not always.

124
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,356
- Shall we?
- I like it here better.

125
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:28,272
- Do you like to be alone?
- Yes. Don't you?

126
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,428
Sometimes.
When I'm upset with someone.

127
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:44,671
- Are you upset now?
- Yes, I am upset.

128
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,634
- With whom?
- With my dad.

129
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,399
He hit Mom.

130
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,829
When do you like being alone?

131
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,509
My dad never hits Mom.

132
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:01,235
But sometimes Mom yells at him. A lot.

133
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,992
- And what does he do?
- He won't talk to her for a while.

134
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:17,751
- Do you know why they do that?
-I don't know. I thought about it...

135
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,314
... but I don't know.

136
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,669
- Let's go back.
- OK.

137
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:45,119
- Is it hard for your dad, being alone here?
- He's not alone. And after all...

138
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:49,233
... He sent me to work in the city.
He always said: "Children, spread your wings and fly!"

139
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:53,512
- Is it interesting to be a mailman?
- Everything is interesting to me.

140
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,074
What "everything"?
Give me an example.

141
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:00,671
Well... not everything.

142
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:06,791
What's going on?

143
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,434
What are you both talking about?

144
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,230
Alex, can you tell me?

145
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:27,751
- Or you, Max?
- I don't know...

146
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:32,635
As a matter of fact, only you know 
what's going on... You and nobody else.

147
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,432
Me?

148
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:39,236
No. I don't know.

149
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,357
But on the other hand,
I might know...

150
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:53,634
- See?
- I have always known...

151
00:46:54,760 --> 00:47:00,949
- Yes, I know.
- Tell me what you know, that I don't know.

152
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:09,438
I might tell you...
If you would live here.

153
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:13,951
Just a little bit.

154
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:19,518
- Dad, when are we going home?
- I don't know.

155
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,713
Go and play. It's still early.

156
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,753
- I've had enough playing.
- Go and play.

157
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:35,391
What do you say about this?
She had enough of it.

158
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:51,356
Three daughters. It's like
having three more wives...

159
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,915
You mind if I have another?

160
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:00,270
- Forget about it Liza, I'll do it myself.
- It doesn't bother me, Vera.

161
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,354
Look at her.

162
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:20,993
If she wants... She can stay
like that all afternoon.

163
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,873
If she wants.

164
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:54,630
- Stand up, Dad.
- I will. Everything is under control.

165
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,433
- Stand up, Dad.
- Come on kids, let's have some tea.

166
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:12,793
- Hello.
- Let's meet somewhere.

167
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,673
- Where are you?
- At the train station.

168
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,151
- Come over.
- No, I don't want to.

169
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,989
- But we have guests.
- Georgy?

170
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:30,798
- Yes. With Max and Viktor.
- Take Georgy's car. I'll be waiting for you.

171
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,354
OK. I will.

172
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:53,477
- Dad, who was on the phone?
- Uncle Robert. Do you remember him?

173
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:57,149
- He's waiting. May I take your car?
- The keys are in the ignition.

174
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,875
- Why isn't your friend coming over?
- He doesn't know the way.

175
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,560
- Dad, I want to go with you.
- Come on.

176
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:07,639
- I want to go too.
- No sweetie, you stay here.

177
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:13,192
I'm going anyway!

178
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:18,352
I've said no.

179
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,076
What does he want?

180
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,351
- Who?
- Uncle Robert.

181
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:52,110
Actually we're going to meet
Uncle Mark, not Robert.

182
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:58,556
- Then why did you say Uncle Robert?
- I had no other choice.

183
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:10,112
- Do you like him?
- Who?

184
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,310
Uncle Robert.

185
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,517
Of course. We're friends and we
work together. You know that.

186
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:21,350
- I hate him.
- Why do you hate him?

187
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,075
- He came to our house.
- When?

188
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,237
When you went to make money.

189
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,877
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

190
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,116
I don't know.

191
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:52,352
Mom was going to take us to see the
circus. But then she changed her mind.

192
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:58,032
We went there with Nina.
He was home when we came back.

193
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,836
- I waited all night for you.
- You were gambling all night.

194
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,914
I didn't find a car.

195
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,870
So what happened?

196
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:06,830
Vera is pregnant. It's not my child.

197
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,839
She told me yesterday.

198
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:20,229
- What are you going to do about it?
- I'm afraid, that I'm going to kill her.

199
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:28,996
- How many months?
- I don't know. A couple of months I think.

200
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,954
Oh God!

201
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:42,354
What's going on, Mark?
What's happening to us?

202
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:48,077
What happens, happens. Like a card game.
You play the hand you're dealt.

203
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:51,954
I was certain she
was going to get rid of it.

204
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,038
But she's smiling.
Can you picture that?

205
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,310
Mark, what should I do?

206
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,870
You have the right to do
whatever you want to do.

207
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,675
Kill if you want to kill.

208
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,474
The gun is in the upper drawer.
And that's it.

209
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:22,800
Forgive if you want to forgive.
And that's it.

210
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:27,710
- You should make a decision.
- What should I decide, Mark?

211
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:34,479
I don't want to lose my
children the way you did.

212
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:41,755
I can't believe
this is happening to me.

213
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:45,509
I haven't lost my children.
I've just got used to the idea -

214
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:50,031
- that they don't exist.

215
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:55,109
- But they do exist, and they are alive!
- So what?

216
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:59,392
- You don't want to know
anything about them?
- No.

217
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,519
- And that is fair?
- That's fair.

218
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:10,397
- This was my card.
- I don't understand.

219
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:16,753
Then... Be good...
It's easy. Heads or tails.

220
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:27,437
We gambled until morning.
But we were waiting for you.

221
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:33,237
- Take it. You need it.
- No, no...

222
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,597
Are you going to your son?
He's waiting for you.

223
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,757
He's melting from heat.

224
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:51,670
- Are you sure...
- About what?

225
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:55,679
Could you be fooling yourself?

226
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:02,030
No.

227
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:08,794
- And that's fair?
- That is fair.

228
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,558
Kir, let's go.

229
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:40,037
Are you sure that this
is where you lost it?

230
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:45,278
Well... yes.
Or maybe I left it inside.

231
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:50,029
Look. I found it.

232
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:16,711
Mark smells the same way
it smells inside the house.

233
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:37,115
And come back whenever 
you please... anytime.

234
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:40,789
I would be happy if you wouldn't
leave. Where else can you find
a sky like this?

235
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:45,755
Alexander, come and move here.

236
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:49,919
- I don't think so.
- Have a good evening. Bye-bye.

237
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:55,036
Bye-bye.

238
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,915
I have forgotten something.

239
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,474
- Kir, aren't you tired?
- Yes, I am tired.

240
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,114
Go to sleep.

241
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,633
I would like to talk to you, 
when you're ready.

242
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,479
I can't hear you.
The water is running.

243
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:15,838
I would like to talk to you, 
when you're ready.

244
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:39,112
I am afraid to talk to you.

245
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:45,509
I am afraid too, but think
about it... we need to talk.

246
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,710
As you wish.

247
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:22,876
I know how you
and your brother are.

248
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,356
- And what Kir is going to turn into.
- Vera!

249
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:40,191
If you in your heart feel sorry for me,
just a little bit... You should be
submissive without any doubts.

250
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:44,119
Understand.

251
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,789
And help me to help my son
and my daughter.

252
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:52,278
Let me help you.

253
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:02,595
- This baby, Alex...
- I don't care about your child.

254
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:06,998
I want to know what you are
going to do about this child.

255
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:33,713
We have become estranged.

256
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:42,159
You are a stranger and
you always have been.

257
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:47,434
- And you always will be.
- What are you talking about?

258
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:50,518
Were we always estranged?

259
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:57,159
- Will we always be two strangers?
- Vera, I don't want to yell at you.

260
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:01,114
I don't want to harm you.
I don't want to hurt you.

261
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:04,676
I just want to know
what you are going to do.

262
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:12,835
Vera, you're in trouble,
do you get that?

263
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,997
You've become tired.

264
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,557
Are you really so tired?

265
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:31,313
And you...
What are you going to do?

266
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,470
Sleep!

267
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:32,076
Hello?

268
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:37,470
All right, Vera, get the 
breakfast ready. We'll go on.

269
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:43,635
You're going to be their mother
and I'm going to be their father.

270
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:05,078


271
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:11,389


272
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:55,229
- Hello? Talk!
- Long distance call. Is this 321-510?

273
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:58,033
- Yes.
- He hung up.

274
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:05,475
- Where was this phonecall from?
- From the city. 615-3018.
Would you like to call back?

275
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:10,230
- Hello. Are you still on the phone?
- No. Thank you.

276
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:19,396
Robert...

277
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:29,557
- Dad, who called?
- Mark. Let's go.

278
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:29,511
- Was Grandfather like Georgy?
- What do you mean?

279
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:34,350
- Was he as old?
- No. He was younger.

280
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:39,753
Why did he die?

281
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,599
Everybody dies.

282
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:05,591
Why is there no writing on
this stone like on the others?

283
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:09,429
I don't know. It is
probably what he wanted.

284
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:26,792
Hello?

285
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:31,198
- No, it's Frida.
- This is Kir. How are you?

286
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:36,269
- We're home doing nothing.
- May I speak with Flora?

287
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:41,838
- Yes, hold on.
- Flora! It's for you.

288
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:46,395
It's Kir.

289
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:51,755
Hello?

290
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:55,156
- Hi Flora.
- Hi.

291
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:59,437
- How are you?
- Mom and Dad are going out...

292
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:03,712
...and we're staying
home with Grandma. Come over!

293
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:08,118
- Who's on the phone?
- Kir. May he come over?

294
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:10,800
Sure, give me the phone.

295
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,592
- Hi Kir.
- Hi.

296
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:16,633
Is your father there?
I want to talk to him.

297
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:20,639
I'll tell him few words
and then I'll let you talk with her.

298
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:22,512
Ok.

299
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:25,393
Dad, it's for you.

300
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,239
- Hello.
- Hello, Alexander.

301
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:36,351
Liza and I are going to the city.

302
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:40,598
- Do you need anything?
- No, thank you.

303
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:48,070
The girls were saying that Kir and 
Eva might come over. We'd like that.

304
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:53,832
I'll come get them, and bring them
back tonight. Or maybe tomorrow...

305
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:59,795
...so you and Vera could spend
some time alone? How about that?

306
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:04,549
Until tomorrow? I don't know.

307
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:08,798
- So are they coming or not?
- Hold on a minute. Kir!

308
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:12,310
- Would you like to go see Flora?
- Yes.

309
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:16,557
- Eva!
- Yes Daddy?

310
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:19,399
Would you like to go
see the girls?

311
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:22,159
- Is Kir coming?
- I'm coming, I'm coming!

312
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:24,669
- Viktor.
- I heard that, I'll come pick them up.

313
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:36,278
- Hello. Please speak.
- I'm sorry. I dialed a wrong number.

314
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:41,793
You've dialed a city number. From this 
phone you cannot dial long distance.

315
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:45,469
You may call long distance using the
public phone located at the train station...

316
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:50,071
- Or through the operator.

317
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,838
Then I would like
to use the operator.

318
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:25,516
- Yes. Hello?
- Robert. It's Vera.

319
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:27,790
Good afternoon, Vera.

320
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:33,875
- Is everything all right?
- Yes.

321
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:40,959
I called you today but
no one answered the phone.

322
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:43,640
No one was here.


323
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:53,712
- Sure that everything is all right?
- Yes. Sure.

324
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:59,073
I don't even
know why I've called you.

325
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:01,236
- Vera...
- Yes?

326
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:04,511
Take care...

327
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:09,430
- Take care of your children.
- Thank you, Robert.

328
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:15,192
- Good bye.
- Good bye.

329
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:05,032
They will not come back soon.
Let's go for a walk.

330
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:18,551
We need to make a decision.

331
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:24,152
I don't want to talk
right now about adultery.

332
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:30,674
I want to forget about all of this.
Let's get rid of the child.

333
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:33,872
We need to do it,
are you listening to me?

334
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:39,869
There are things more
important than this.

335
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:45,916
Everything is going to be all
right. We'll start over.

336
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,150
We'll try.

337
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:55,236
- Why don't you answer?
- Do whatever you want... Fast.

338
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:59,398
I have no regrets.

339
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:40,879
Hello? A phonecall to the city.
643-1606.

340
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,319
Yes, I'll wait.

341
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:18,950
Hello. Mark, it's me.
If you know someone that'll do it...

342
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:23,517
- bring him over today. 
Can you?

343
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:27,199
OK. I'll wait.

344
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:28,349
- Hello?
- Hi. It's me.

345
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:32,598
I found two. It'll take about 40 minutes.
In two days she'll be back on her feet again.

346
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:36,838
- She'll forget everything in a month.
- All right.

347
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:45,912
- Yes?
- Hello, Dad. Can we stay here overnight?


348
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:50,079
It's so interesting. Uncle Viktor
could bring us back home tomorrow.

349
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:52,509
- Is he back already?
- Yes, he just came back.

350
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:56,519
- I want to talk to him.
- Daddy, please. He asked us.

351
01:20:56,640 --> 01:21:00,553
It's all right with me, but I want
to talk with Uncle Viktor.

352
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:05,629
- Uncle Viktor, Dad wants to talk to you.
- I'm coming right now.

353
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,953
Frida.

354
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,390
Look, read here.

355
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:01,479
"Though I speak with the tongues
of men and of angels"-

356
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:06,754
- "and have not love, I am become
as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal."

357
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:11,431
"And though I have the gift of prophecy,
and understand all mysteries," -

358
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:17,032
- "and all knowledge; and though I have
all faith, so that I could remove mountains," -

359
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:20,152
- "and have not Love,
I am nothing."

360
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:27,356
"And though I bestow all my goods to feed the
poor, and though I give my body to be burned" -

361
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:32,315
- "and have not Love,
it profith me nothing..."

362
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:36,513
"Love suffereth long,
and is kind;"

363
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:42,192
"Love envieth not."

364
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:46,359
"Love vaunteth not itself,
is not puffed up, "

365
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:51,838
"doeth not behave itself unseemly.
Seeketh not her own. Is not easily provoked. "

366
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:59,116
" Thinketh no evil. Rejoiceth not in inequity,
but rejoiceth in the truth."

367
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:06,635
"Bareth all things. Believeth all things.
Hopeth all things. Endureth all things."

368
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:05,316
She's going to wake up for a while,
but she will go back to sleep.

369
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:09,035
She'll have to stay in bed until Thursday
and then she'll have to rest for a month.

370
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:12,152
I left tablets for her.
One after eating but, -

371
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:16,956
- no more than three a day.She can take
two, but only if absolutely necessary.

372
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:22,273
There are the instructions as well.

373
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:26,033
That's all.

374
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:31,792
I'll come back soon.

375
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:45,350
- Have you seen her?
- She's sleeping.

376
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:57,275
She didn't make any noise... Even though 
she couldn't stand the pain.

377
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:01,678
Of course. She has been
given pills. Don't worry.

378
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:08,514
Don't you think that I have done
what I was supposed to do?

379
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:13,794
I definitely do.
Let's have a coffee.

380
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:57,357
I don't like the way she looks.

381
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:01,635
Calm down.

382
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:04,832
Go and see for yourself.

383
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:29,830
I don't know. I think she's fine.

384
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:35,034
- Maybe we should wake her up?
- No. Let her sleep.

385
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:40,150
I'll stay here.

386
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:42,953
I'll be in the kitchen.

387
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:13,116
Vera...

388
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:20,955
I am so sorry.

389
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:28,118
Don't make me feel worse.

390
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:38,478
I made a mistake.
I know.

391
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:50,430
Help me, Vera.
Help me.

392
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:58,198
She's dying.

393
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:03,148
- Don't be ridiculous.
- She's dying.

394
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:25,196
- Who are you calling?
- A doctor from here. A good friend of mine.

395
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:28,790
- Why don't you call for an ambulance?
- Have you lost your mind? Don't you 
  understand the situation?

396
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:32,356
- Hello, Gherman? It's Mark.
- Damn the situation!

397
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:34,914
I need your help.

398
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:38,271
At our place.
Yes, here.

399
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:42,153
Come as soon as you can.

400
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:46,478
A woman has had an abortion.
She might be in a coma.

401
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:49,433
A few hours ago.

402
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:54,038
I'll wait.

403
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:59,994
He's coming.

404
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:40,951
- Where?
- In the bedroom.

405
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:15,796
She needs to go to the hospital.
I'll call for an ambulance.

406
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:19,037
- We should take her to the hospital.
- No, no.

407
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:23,836
- Why? What is the problem?
- Believe me, it's better
  to call for an ambulance.

408
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:26,793
Mark, we need to talk.

409
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:37,074
She is dead.

410
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:41,237
I am going to declare
it as a cardiac arrest.

411
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:46,398
I am so sorry. My advise for you
is to take care of your brother.

412
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:49,193
He is your brother, isn't he?

413
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:51,470
Poor girl!

414
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:21,671
Alex...

415
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:24,916
Alex...

416
01:34:26,640 --> 01:34:31,555
Alex, calm down.

417
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:15,994
- I have to tell you something.
- Later.

418
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:18,839
It is important.

419
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:22,032
Nothing is important anymore.

420
01:36:54,640 --> 01:37:00,556
We have to rush the formalities.

421
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:04,753
The gossip is spreading very fast around
here. Even before something happened.

422
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:43,516
I want this, -

423
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:51,878
The cheapest coffin.
The night gown she has on.

424
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:55,754
No makeup. Don't touch her.

425
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:59,270
The funeral is tomorrow at noon.

426
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:11,556
I want to see her.

427
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:18,316
I'll take you there.
This way.

428
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:07,879
Go.

429
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:12,915
I want to stay here.
I've killed her.

430
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:18,192
- I've killed my wife.
- It was an accident.

431
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:22,629
What have I done?

432
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:26,514
Let's not talk about what happened, let's
talk about what should be done now.

433
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:35,277
- What should be done?
- Bury Vera.

434
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:46,469
Damn you, Mark.

435
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:49,638
Go.

436
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:36,590
Mark?

437
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:48,476
You had a heart attack. You need
to go immediately to the hospital.

438
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:56,675
Tomorrow I should stand up.
At least for few hours.

439
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:59,268
Absolutely not.

440
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:06,190
Don't call the ambulance!
I don't go anywhere.

441
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:09,357
I don't negotiate this.

442
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:12,552
You owe me.

443
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:22,190
OK. You're the boss.

444
01:41:23,560 --> 01:41:29,271
Go call my brother.
But don't talk too much.

445
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:40,039
Mark is calling for you.
It's worse than he thinks.

446
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:52,434
- Call Viktor and tell him...
- I've already called him.

447
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:56,553
- How are the kids?
- They don't know anything yet.

448
01:41:57,960 --> 01:42:00,793
That's true.

449
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:04,799
You need to tell them.

450
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:08,310
Calm down.
I know what I'm supposed to do.

451
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:11,000
That's good.

452
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:26,957
Why didn't you tell me anything? They should
have seen that something was wrong with her.

453
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:53,718
I tried to tell you earlier...

454
01:42:54,760 --> 01:43:00,198
I'll tell you what I think it happened. I 
believe, that she died from a different reason.

455
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:04,552
Overdose. They were very strong.

456
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:07,638
Just few tablets are enough
to make you not wake up again.

457
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:12,675
- It seems that she took all of them at once.
- Are you sure?

458
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:15,633
We'll be sure only
after the autopsy.

459
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:19,116
- No autopsy will be made.
- Yes. Well then...

460
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:23,511
There were a few morphological changes...

461
01:43:23,640 --> 01:43:27,792
...that could have been
caused by narcotics.

462
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:31,913
What's weird is that they
didn't try to resuscitate her.

463
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:37,398
They were very calm saying that
she had to sleep for a while.

464
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:40,478
That means that everything went normal.

465
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:46,311
See... they did their job and woke her up
to make sure she was all right.

466
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:49,637
I don't know.
One more thing.

467
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:56,711
I found this next to her.

468
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:13,270
It's a pregnancy test result.
The other side.

469
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:47,037
Will you tell him?

470
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:55,590
No.

471
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:15,358
You're not allowed to stand up.

472
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:23,316
Give me something. As much as
I need to make it for 3 hours.

473
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:29,874
- You are not allowed to
  stand up for any reason.
- Give me something!

474
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:40,239
- You don't understand the situation.
- I just need to... To walk.

475
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:51,393
- Then I'll go with you.
- No. It's just for us.

476
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:58,752
He might need emergency help.
I'll be here.

477
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:45,319
This is for Mark.
Please take care of him.

478
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:38,873
What are you doing here?

479
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:44,239
Let's go inside.

480
02:02:36,920 --> 02:02:41,198
Yes, I'm listening.

481
02:02:51,080 --> 02:02:58,316
Vera, don't fall asleep. Try not
to fall asleep, do you hear me?

482
02:02:58,440 --> 02:03:00,795
I'll be right there.

483
02:03:00,920 --> 02:03:06,233
Leave the door unlocked. Still there?
Do you hear me?

484
02:03:06,360 --> 02:03:09,033
I'll be right there.

485
02:04:00,280 --> 02:04:03,317
Vera! Vera!

486
02:05:37,480 --> 02:05:41,758
It's cold. I'll make another one.

487
02:05:53,240 --> 02:05:55,754
- Robert?
- Yes?

488
02:05:55,880 --> 02:06:00,078
Promise that you won't tell anybody.

489
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:14,833
- Where are the children Vera?
- They're sleeping at Nina's.

490
02:06:22,120 --> 02:06:25,999
- Robert?
- Yes.

491
02:06:28,440 --> 02:06:31,159
Promise me.

492
02:06:32,840 --> 02:06:35,912
I promise.

493
02:06:51,880 --> 02:06:53,677
It's dawn.

494
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:13,952
- Mama, who was it?
- I have received a letter.

495
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:16,913
- From Dad?
- No.

496
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:22,672
- From who?
- Mom, come see, he cut open Linda's head!

497
02:08:22,800 --> 02:08:27,316
- Why did you do that?
- I wanted to see what was inside.

498
02:08:27,440 --> 02:08:30,989
- And?
- Nothing.

499
02:08:31,120 --> 02:08:34,430
What did you think
that you would see?

500
02:08:37,720 --> 02:08:41,076
It's just a doll, Mom.

501
02:08:41,200 --> 02:08:46,433
He said that there's no
need for clowns in a circus.

502
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:48,755
Don't lie. I said I'm not
interested in clowns.

503
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:52,077
That's enough. Go play.

504
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:27,550
- Hello?
- Hi. It's Robert.

505
02:10:27,680 --> 02:10:31,878
- How do you feel?
- Honestly? Not well.

506
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:37,120
We were supposed to go see
the circus, but I felt sick.

507
02:10:37,240 --> 02:10:40,516
I asked Nina to take
the children to the circus.

508
02:10:41,680 --> 02:10:45,070
Would you like me to come over?

509
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:48,112
- Would you come?
- Yes.

510
02:11:11,480 --> 02:11:15,314
The other day, I lost the keys
to my apartment.

511
02:11:15,440 --> 02:11:21,879
The landlord lives on the other side of the
city. I thought that he might have a spare key.

512
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:26,949
But I couldn't remember his phone number. It 
was in my notebook, inside my apartment.

513
02:11:27,080 --> 02:11:32,757
I went to a bar and I had a drink.
And another drink.

514
02:11:32,880 --> 02:11:37,670
- And you found the keys
on the bottom of the glass.
- Exactly. How did you know that?

515
02:11:37,800 --> 02:11:40,997
- Because you're telling lies.
- No. It's true.

516
02:11:41,120 --> 02:11:46,478
I remembered his phone number. It just 
came to me all of a sudden.

517
02:11:50,240 --> 02:11:53,869
I've never lost my keys.

518
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:59,279
I envy you. But there's still
time to lose them.

519
02:12:02,520 --> 02:12:07,913
- Vera, what's going on?
- Everything is fine. I'll be ok in a minute.

520
02:12:08,040 --> 02:12:10,759
Are you ok?

521
02:12:33,800 --> 02:12:37,236
Would you like some water?

522
02:12:37,360 --> 02:12:40,830
No. I'm better now.

523
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:46,717
Stay a little bit longer if you can.
Until they come back.

524
02:12:46,840 --> 02:12:51,038
- I don't want to be alone.
- All right.

525
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:02,074
- I'll get up and make coffee.
- No. Just lay down. I'll make the coffee.

526
02:13:28,360 --> 02:13:32,512
Would you like to look at our pictures?
You didn't see them, did you?

527
02:13:32,640 --> 02:13:36,792
- No.
- There they are, on the bottom shelf.

528
02:13:50,680 --> 02:13:53,399
This is his father.

529
02:13:56,800 --> 02:13:59,837
Here are all three of them.

530
02:14:00,920 --> 02:14:07,109
Father, Alex and Mark.

531
02:14:11,800 --> 02:14:15,156
This is Mark with his family.

532
02:14:18,600 --> 02:14:21,433
This is my mother.

533
02:14:25,200 --> 02:14:28,988
This is Eva when she
was less that a year old.

534
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:36,754
And this... is me before
I got married.

535
02:14:37,960 --> 02:14:43,592
See, the photos are in such a mess.
We don't have time for this.

536
02:14:46,720 --> 02:14:51,077
This is when Alex was taking
me to the maternity ward.

537
02:14:59,800 --> 02:15:02,234
Vera...

538
02:15:04,680 --> 02:15:08,389
Why did you want to do
something like that yesterday?

539
02:15:09,160 --> 02:15:11,549
I feel terrible.

540
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:19,313
- I can't explain anything to him.
- To Alex?

541
02:15:20,920 --> 02:15:24,879
- I am pregnant.
- Are you pregnant?

542
02:15:28,720 --> 02:15:33,794
I'm sorry... But this isn't Alex's baby?

543
02:15:33,920 --> 02:15:36,798
It's his baby...

544
02:15:39,080 --> 02:15:41,355
...and it isn't.

545
02:15:41,480 --> 02:15:44,392
What do you mean?

546
02:15:44,520 --> 02:15:48,672
It is his baby. Of course it is. 
Whose else?

547
02:15:51,480 --> 02:15:55,871
But it is not his, in a way that...
...Our children are not ours.

548
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,116
They're actually not only ours.

549
02:15:58,240 --> 02:16:02,677
The way we're not only our
parents' children. Not only theirs.

550
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:04,950
Do you understand?

551
02:16:13,560 --> 02:16:18,714
I stay awake throughout the night
and I can't go to sleep.

552
02:16:20,240 --> 02:16:23,789
I hear him breathing.

553
02:16:23,920 --> 02:16:28,232
He loves us just for his sake.
Like objects.

554
02:16:28,360 --> 02:16:33,434
God! I've been living like this for years.

555
02:16:35,640 --> 02:16:40,760
Why do I feel so lonely? Why isn't he 
talking to me the way he used to?

556
02:16:40,880 --> 02:16:44,555
Or I thought he was talking to me...

557
02:16:44,680 --> 02:16:50,038
I wouldn't be able to explain anything
to him. I need to do something.

558
02:16:50,160 --> 02:16:56,269
If he's going on like this everything will die.
I don't want to give birth to death.

559
02:16:56,400 --> 02:17:01,952
We could live without dying.
There's such a possibility.

560
02:17:02,080 --> 02:17:07,029
- What possibility, Vera?
- I don't know, but it surely does exist.

561
02:17:07,160 --> 02:17:11,278
And it's only possible together,
one for another, otherwise...

562
02:17:11,400 --> 02:17:17,999
It's impossible by oneself. There's no point.
It's a vicious circle.

563
02:17:18,120 --> 02:17:25,390
How can I explain that to him? And make him 
see and understand what he's doing.

564
02:17:28,760 --> 02:17:30,990
Mom, we're back.

565
02:17:35,520 --> 02:17:40,548
Why is he here?
Why isn't he home?

566
02:17:41,920 --> 02:17:45,708
Kir! How can you behave like that?

567
02:17:47,080 --> 02:17:50,914
Nina, I'll come right away.

568
02:17:55,320 --> 02:17:59,029
- I am sorry, Robert.
- Don't worry about that.

569
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:09,588
I should go now.

570
02:18:52,560 --> 02:18:56,348
324-311 please.

571
02:18:58,560 --> 02:19:04,954
Viktor? It's me, Alexander.
How are you?

572
02:19:05,080 --> 02:19:10,438
I'll come today for my children.
Tell them when they wake up.

573
02:19:10,560 --> 02:19:14,633
I'm calling from the city.
I'll be there soon.
