1
00:01:29,967 --> 00:01:32,765
To our limits

2
00:01:37,767 --> 00:01:39,166
Well done, champ.

3
00:01:40,727 --> 00:01:42,080
Super.

4
00:01:43,327 --> 00:01:45,795
Okay. In front of you.

5
00:01:45,967 --> 00:01:48,527
Compact, yeah, come on!

6
00:01:50,767 --> 00:01:52,883
Strong pulse, strong.

7
00:01:58,927 --> 00:02:00,360
Your place.

8
00:02:02,487 --> 00:02:05,638
Super, forward. Come on.
Come and get it.

9
00:02:11,487 --> 00:02:12,806
Very good.

10
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:21,286
Compact, robust, very good.

11
00:02:24,127 --> 00:02:27,119
Okay, stop.
- Go! Go ahead!

12
00:02:27,287 --> 00:02:29,039
Come on! Final set.

13
00:02:34,847 --> 00:02:36,599
Beware, concentrate!

14
00:02:40,007 --> 00:02:42,965
Okay, come back! It does not matter.
- Damn!

15
00:02:43,127 --> 00:02:44,526
Yes, come on!

16
00:02:46,687 --> 00:02:48,439
Winning point. Each ball.

17
00:02:50,807 --> 00:02:53,765
Come on, final ball, winning point! Okay.

18
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:55,760
Very good.

19
00:02:55,927 --> 00:02:57,838
Your wrist.
- Yes.

20
00:02:58,527 --> 00:02:59,880
Top.

21
00:03:03,647 --> 00:03:06,525
Super. That's enough for today.
Thank you.

22
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:17,560
Top, how much?
- 42.

23
00:03:17,727 --> 00:03:20,002
Good training, Jonas, very good.

24
00:03:28,327 --> 00:03:30,397
Bye, Jonas, see you Wednesday.

25
00:03:36,527 --> 00:03:38,836
Hi!
- Ready?

26
00:03:39,007 --> 00:03:41,475
Yes.
- Hi, Jonas.

27
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:45,762
Hey, you all right?
- Yes.

28
00:03:46,447 --> 00:03:49,519
Are you ready for today, Jonas?
- Yes.

29
00:03:50,327 --> 00:03:52,397
Want a ride?
- No, it's okay.

30
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:54,876
He runs back.

31
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:56,795
I take the train.

32
00:03:56,967 --> 00:03:59,527
Want something to drink?
- Yes.

33
00:04:00,647 --> 00:04:02,046
Let's go.

34
00:04:03,047 --> 00:04:05,686
Will you join us?
- Yes.

35
00:04:05,927 --> 00:04:09,044
Bye, Bernard.
- Ciao, Bernard.

36
00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:18,117
But Jonas, those are excuses.

37
00:04:18,287 --> 00:04:21,484
You're an idiot and you do not have the guts.
- Whatever!

38
00:04:22,527 --> 00:04:26,281
No, but love and sexuality,
that is not the same.

39
00:04:26,447 --> 00:04:30,998
The first time is important, no?
I want to do it with someone I love.

40
00:04:33,327 --> 00:04:34,726
Who is it?

41
00:04:38,327 --> 00:04:41,558
Come on, who is it?
- No one.

42
00:04:48,927 --> 00:04:50,838
She doesn't want to anyway.

43
00:04:51,607 --> 00:04:53,040
And why?

44
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,321
She is super intelligent,
she goes to the 6th year.

45
00:04:56,487 --> 00:04:59,445
And then?
- She will not want to.

46
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:02,565
But Jonas
you're not inferior.

47
00:05:02,727 --> 00:05:05,321
Jonas, you have to take your chances.
You should not underestimate yourself.

48
00:05:05,487 --> 00:05:10,436
If I were your age,
I would definitely be in love with you.

49
00:05:12,927 --> 00:05:14,724
Yeah, but you're an idiot.

50
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:24,645
What's the girl's name?
- Delphine.

51
00:05:28,247 --> 00:05:29,839
To Delphine!

52
00:08:25,127 --> 00:08:26,845
I love you.

53
00:08:44,687 --> 00:08:48,282
I would like to take the time
to talk with you, but ...

54
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:51,046
well ...

55
00:08:51,887 --> 00:08:53,923
I take it you already suspected this ...

56
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,841
We don't think it's a good idea
to hold you back another year.

57
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:07,355
Then your classmates will be
3 or 4 years younger than you.

58
00:09:12,647 --> 00:09:17,004
We believe it's better if you
go to a technical or vocational school.

59
00:09:18,727 --> 00:09:21,116
How much did I have for French?

60
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:23,724
9.

61
00:09:25,687 --> 00:09:28,326
But Ms. Libotte says that

62
00:09:28,487 --> 00:09:32,002
without your big problems in spelling
and grammar, you would have had good points

63
00:09:40,727 --> 00:09:45,084
Go to Ms. Lambert in the PMS center.
She will help you find a new school.

64
00:09:45,247 --> 00:09:46,760
Agree?

65
00:09:50,487 --> 00:09:52,603
Will you ask your mom to call me?

66
00:09:55,527 --> 00:09:57,245
You will not forget?

67
00:10:03,367 --> 00:10:04,959
All the best.

68
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:17,239
Goodbye, Jonas.

69
00:10:51,247 --> 00:10:52,680
Jonas!

70
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:56,005
What?
- How did it go?

71
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:58,317
No, they do not want me restart.

72
00:10:58,487 --> 00:11:00,603
Really?
- Yes.

73
00:11:11,447 --> 00:11:13,517
What a bunch of assholes.

74
00:11:17,047 --> 00:11:19,925
Mom called. You have to call back.

75
00:11:58,127 --> 00:12:00,083
Hey, Mom, it's Jonas.

76
00:12:00,247 --> 00:12:03,762
Well, I just wanted to say that I failed.

77
00:12:03,927 --> 00:12:05,918
I got my report card and ...

78
00:12:07,007 --> 00:12:08,406
Anyway ...

79
00:12:08,927 --> 00:12:11,157
They will not let me pass.

80
00:12:12,127 --> 00:12:13,958
I'll call you later.

81
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,004
She has played well.

82
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:36,082
40-0.

83
00:12:50,487 --> 00:12:52,603
And?
- It's okay.

84
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:55,486
What, it's okay?
- I have two transition exams.

85
00:12:55,647 --> 00:12:58,286
Which subjects?
- Chemistry and Geography.

86
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,957
Come on!
- Forget it.

87
00:13:33,127 --> 00:13:35,357
Get in the water!

88
00:13:35,527 --> 00:13:37,802
No, no, it's okay.
- How brave, Pierre!

89
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:40,481
No, no.
- Yes, come now!

90
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:42,805
He will not go in the water.

91
00:13:42,967 --> 00:13:45,356
Come on.
- No, I don't want. Damn!

92
00:13:45,527 --> 00:13:48,997
Okay, we do nothing. We're leaving.
- No!

93
00:14:25,607 --> 00:14:28,041
On your lovers, Jonas!
- On your dick!

94
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,718
We drink on Jonas his dick.

95
00:14:31,887 --> 00:14:34,276
Well, how was it?
- It was good.

96
00:14:34,447 --> 00:14:36,039
Yes?
- Yes.

97
00:14:36,207 --> 00:14:38,926
It was good, that's it?

98
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,918
How good was it?
- Really good.

99
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:43,237
It was really good!
- Leave him alone!

100
00:14:43,407 --> 00:14:45,921
So you're happy?
- Yes.

101
00:14:46,567 --> 00:14:49,604
How many times have you done it?
- 1 time.

102
00:14:49,967 --> 00:14:52,083
And how long did it take?
- I do not know ...

103
00:14:52,247 --> 00:14:53,600
An hour?

104
00:14:54,447 --> 00:14:57,917
But no, not even.
- How long than approximately?

105
00:14:58,087 --> 00:15:02,046
I do not know ... 5-6 minutes ...
- Oh yes!

106
00:15:02,207 --> 00:15:05,995
5-6 min plaisure,
that's still 5-6 min of happiness.

107
00:15:06,687 --> 00:15:09,155
And how was she?
Wait! How was she?

108
00:15:09,327 --> 00:15:11,602
Was she good, at ease?
What has she done to you?

109
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:13,723
Nothing fancy.

110
00:15:14,007 --> 00:15:16,567
Has she sucked you,
shown you things,

111
00:15:16,727 --> 00:15:20,720
caressed you down there?
- No.

112
00:15:23,287 --> 00:15:25,960
He takes it easy.
- And how did you do it?

113
00:15:26,247 --> 00:15:28,807
On the sofa.
- Yes.

114
00:15:28,967 --> 00:15:30,958
Yes?
- Was she down? On all fours?

115
00:15:31,127 --> 00:15:33,322
We lay down.
- She on top?

116
00:15:33,487 --> 00:15:36,718
Yes ... uh no ... vice versa.

117
00:15:36,887 --> 00:15:39,959
Okay, the missionary position. Yes ...

118
00:15:40,127 --> 00:15:42,004
One brave little missionary.

119
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:45,806
Was it her 1st time too?
- Yes.

120
00:15:48,087 --> 00:15:51,966
That's normal. My 1st time was with someone
my age, just as inexperienced.

121
00:15:52,127 --> 00:15:56,086
He was ready in 5 minutes,
I was not even damp.

122
00:15:56,727 --> 00:15:58,001
It was horrible.

123
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:02,160
It was only when I met someone with
more experience who showed me things,

124
00:16:02,727 --> 00:16:06,481
otherwise I would still not have cum.
Well yes, sorry, with you I would have ...

125
00:16:06,647 --> 00:16:11,004
I started to get worried already.
And the guy with more experience, am I?

126
00:16:11,167 --> 00:16:12,122
No, an old man.

127
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,755
I thought so, if her 1st orgasms
were with me ...

128
00:16:14,927 --> 00:16:17,521
That was late!
- Well, yes ...

129
00:16:27,527 --> 00:16:28,960
Everything okay?

130
00:16:29,687 --> 00:16:32,326
Where have you been?
- At the sea.

131
00:16:34,287 --> 00:16:38,075
When you pass you can clear the table, no?
- Okay, I'll do it.

132
00:16:45,967 --> 00:16:48,401
You also want to move your ass please?

133
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:02,603
What are you going to do for school?

134
00:17:09,407 --> 00:17:11,204
What are you waiting for?

135
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:13,924
It's vacation, relax!

136
00:17:16,967 --> 00:17:21,563
When are you going to spring into action?
- What is that to you? Help me!

137
00:18:01,887 --> 00:18:03,798
40/30.

138
00:18:46,967 --> 00:18:50,118
Damn.
- Game ...

139
00:18:50,487 --> 00:18:51,886
5/4.

140
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:18,005
Time.

141
00:19:54,407 --> 00:19:56,045
0/15.

142
00:20:01,807 --> 00:20:03,684
The training is okay.

143
00:20:04,567 --> 00:20:08,685
In a game, you're too nervous.
You lose it.

144
00:20:19,447 --> 00:20:23,360
Listen, Jonas,
take it easy on the tennis.

145
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:25,923
Concentrate on your studies.

146
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,526
Okay?

147
00:21:58,287 --> 00:22:00,039
Okay, Jonas?

148
00:22:05,847 --> 00:22:07,724
I screw up everything.

149
00:22:07,887 --> 00:22:11,562
At school, tennis,
I'm a failure.

150
00:22:11,727 --> 00:22:15,117
Calm down.
You'll pass year exams.

151
00:22:15,647 --> 00:22:17,558
I don't even have exams!

152
00:22:17,727 --> 00:22:20,287
They don't want me anymore.

153
00:22:21,087 --> 00:22:23,476
I have to go to the losers.

154
00:22:25,647 --> 00:22:29,765
And where is that?
- The vocational school. Where failures go.

155
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,598
Bastards!

156
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:36,646
Come on, Jonas.

157
00:22:36,807 --> 00:22:39,526
No, no, I don't want to.
- Yes, come.

158
00:23:36,007 --> 00:23:38,760
Do you have a bucket?
- In the bathroom.

159
00:24:18,887 --> 00:24:21,162
About the school,

160
00:24:22,167 --> 00:24:23,964
don't sweat it.

161
00:24:27,727 --> 00:24:29,683
You're not dumber than another.

162
00:24:32,527 --> 00:24:34,199
And what does she think?

163
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:38,682
Mom says it's okay.
She has faith in me.

164
00:24:45,407 --> 00:24:48,524
And what do you want to do?

165
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,678
I want to go to the federation, but ...

166
00:24:51,527 --> 00:24:53,040
But Jonas

167
00:24:53,727 --> 00:24:56,400
You really thought you were going to be a pro?

168
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:02,921
Or there is the exam committee.
But that's super heavy.

169
00:25:04,847 --> 00:25:07,202
And how would you prepare for that?

170
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:09,119
Well, a private school ...

171
00:25:09,287 --> 00:25:11,755
Wait, your mother can not afford that.

172
00:25:19,887 --> 00:25:23,323
My father, he can at least do this.

173
00:25:29,807 --> 00:25:33,277
If you need help,
Give me a call.

174
00:25:36,127 --> 00:25:39,881
Pierre has even managed to drag Didier
through college.

175
00:25:42,287 --> 00:25:44,039
It was hard.

176
00:26:02,927 --> 00:26:04,997
I have two transition exams.

177
00:26:05,567 --> 00:26:10,163
If I succeed, I still have three years to go

178
00:26:11,007 --> 00:26:15,080
and I've had it.
That's why I thought of the exam committee.

179
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:19,283
Because at the exam committee, you can

180
00:26:19,447 --> 00:26:22,678
do three years in one.

181
00:26:25,047 --> 00:26:26,844
I do not understand.

182
00:26:27,007 --> 00:26:31,285
You only have two exams, that's not too bad.

183
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:35,720
For once that you can succeed ...
- Yeah, but ...

184
00:26:36,087 --> 00:26:39,159
I'm tired of sitting with little brats of 14

185
00:26:39,327 --> 00:26:43,559
Yes, Jonas, but then you had
to start working earlier.

186
00:26:47,007 --> 00:26:49,396
How much does it cost?

187
00:27:05,127 --> 00:27:09,439
1000 euros per month?

188
00:27:11,807 --> 00:27:13,763
No way!

189
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,241
Can't you give a part of it?

190
00:27:17,407 --> 00:27:22,606
No, you go to school like everyone else,
it's not that bad. 1000, what else!

191
00:27:31,607 --> 00:27:34,804
I failed.
- What!

192
00:27:36,327 --> 00:27:38,795
I failed,
They won't even hold me back.

193
00:27:38,967 --> 00:27:40,958
I have to go to the vocational school.

194
00:28:11,527 --> 00:28:16,157
I told you that if you had failed,
I would stop paying alimony.

195
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:18,795
What does she do? She leaves you alone.

196
00:28:18,967 --> 00:28:23,358
She goes to the south
and thinks that everything will go well here.

197
00:28:23,527 --> 00:28:25,404
She wants to take care of you by herself
but she does not.

198
00:28:25,567 --> 00:28:28,445
Then it's her fault if things go wrong.

199
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:32,282
Why do I always have
to fix everything?

200
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:39,523
Has she told you to come here?
- No.

201
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:44,842
1000 euros per month! She has never
had scruples, but now she exaggerates!

202
00:28:45,007 --> 00:28:48,716
She has always gotten everything,
and she wants more! I gave her the house.

203
00:28:48,887 --> 00:28:52,243
Do you know what that means?

204
00:28:53,087 --> 00:28:54,998
That she fixes it herself now!

205
00:28:56,127 --> 00:28:59,642
What should I do?
- Ask your mother.

206
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:02,203
She has to find a solution.

207
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:44,717
You go to Brussels? Great, thanks.

208
00:29:50,367 --> 00:29:53,120
You can make the exam for the 
exam committee as a free student.

209
00:29:53,807 --> 00:29:56,241
You should therefore not go to school.

210
00:29:56,487 --> 00:29:59,160
That's impossible. That is much too heavy.

211
00:30:00,167 --> 00:30:04,160
But no, we can help you.
- Yes.

212
00:30:08,367 --> 00:30:11,200
I will make inquiries.

213
00:30:12,647 --> 00:30:15,286
We'll do it together, okay?

214
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:23,925
The bastard!

215
00:30:24,087 --> 00:30:27,318
He makes another child with a slut
and he can not even take care of his own.

216
00:30:30,247 --> 00:30:33,796
Don't call your father a bastard.

217
00:30:34,407 --> 00:30:36,318
He probably does what he can.

218
00:30:37,927 --> 00:30:41,283
You can also see this as a real opportunity.

219
00:30:42,367 --> 00:30:44,039
It is a challenge.

220
00:30:47,567 --> 00:30:52,163
If you succeed,
you will always be safe.

221
00:30:58,767 --> 00:31:01,281
Do you know what you have to learn
for the exam committee?

222
00:31:01,447 --> 00:31:02,800
Yes.

223
00:31:11,847 --> 00:31:15,635
And it's not because Pierre is going to help,
that you will succeed.

224
00:31:24,527 --> 00:31:27,883
Have you been to dad?
- Yes.

225
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:31,085
What did you tell him?

226
00:31:31,247 --> 00:31:34,000
I told him.

227
00:31:35,487 --> 00:31:37,557
And what did he say?

228
00:31:38,567 --> 00:31:40,159
Nothing.

229
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:45,005
Nothing at all?

230
00:31:46,047 --> 00:31:47,719
He said nothing.

231
00:31:55,127 --> 00:31:58,119
Are you sure I need all that?
- Yes.

232
00:32:01,807 --> 00:32:03,479
I'll pay you back.

233
00:32:04,527 --> 00:32:06,802
Don't worry. I can pay it.

234
00:32:10,407 --> 00:32:14,639
Do you have a historical atlas?
- No, I'll use yours.

235
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:17,002
I prefer that you have your own stuff.

236
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:33,442
For example: A is your pencil,
B is your eraser.

237
00:32:34,887 --> 00:32:36,605
What is C then?

238
00:32:36,927 --> 00:32:40,044
That.
- Yes. And what is "it"?

239
00:32:40,207 --> 00:32:44,519
Pencil and eraser.
- I restart the exercise.

240
00:32:44,687 --> 00:32:49,044
I have a pencil and an eraser,
equal to a pencil plus an eraser.

241
00:32:49,207 --> 00:32:53,644
Then a pencil plus an eraser
minus an eraser equals ... ?

242
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:59,161
A pencil. So A.
- Exactly.

243
00:32:59,327 --> 00:33:00,680
Mathematics is not more than that.

244
00:33:00,847 --> 00:33:04,203
It is sometimes complicated,
but it remains very concrete.

245
00:33:04,647 --> 00:33:08,720
You have to promise me that if you don't
understand it, you ask me immediately.

246
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:10,798
Otherwise it will not work.

247
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:13,801
You have to learn how to learn.

248
00:33:14,047 --> 00:33:16,959
And I will be glad
if you do not longer need me.

249
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:35,360
Well?

250
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:37,998
Do not touch me!

251
00:33:39,047 --> 00:33:42,437
I wanted to know if you're okay. Why?

252
00:33:45,087 --> 00:33:46,486
Everything okay?

253
00:33:54,007 --> 00:33:55,360
Come on!

254
00:33:55,727 --> 00:33:57,399
Hey, you're jealous!

255
00:34:00,567 --> 00:34:02,444
Fuck you!

256
00:34:07,767 --> 00:34:09,200
Everything okay?

257
00:34:11,527 --> 00:34:15,361
Why didn't you come?
- I had a game.

258
00:34:16,607 --> 00:34:19,041
How did it go?
- Super.

259
00:34:19,287 --> 00:34:21,403
I've had enough of it.

260
00:34:22,767 --> 00:34:25,839
I'm going to study for the exam committee.

261
00:34:27,047 --> 00:34:28,400
That's all right.

262
00:34:46,607 --> 00:34:49,280
Are we going out?
- Yes.

263
00:35:35,727 --> 00:35:37,240
What is it?

264
00:35:37,847 --> 00:35:39,280
Nothing.

265
00:35:40,167 --> 00:35:41,680
Is it okay?

266
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:44,679
I do not know ...

267
00:35:46,967 --> 00:35:48,400
What?

268
00:35:49,807 --> 00:35:51,763
I don't go too fast?

269
00:35:52,207 --> 00:35:53,560
No.

270
00:35:55,607 --> 00:35:57,643
Did you cum?

271
00:35:57,967 --> 00:35:59,446
Yes.

272
00:36:17,247 --> 00:36:19,238
He is ready
to throw the bomb at the Duke

273
00:36:19,407 --> 00:36:23,525
when he realizes that the Duke is accompanied
by his 2 children. He would rather wait.

274
00:36:23,687 --> 00:36:25,917
The whole piece is about commitment,

275
00:36:26,087 --> 00:36:28,681
and how far you are willing to go
for that commitment.

276
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:34,606
For example, would you blow
yourself up in a bus

277
00:36:34,767 --> 00:36:37,201
in the name of freedom?
- No.

278
00:36:37,367 --> 00:36:40,916
I don't want to kill innocents.

279
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:45,355
You think like Camus. He says:

280
00:36:45,967 --> 00:36:48,322
What are the limits of
striving for justice?

281
00:36:48,487 --> 00:36:51,126
Even though our intentions are good,

282
00:36:51,287 --> 00:36:53,801
is there a limit that we are not
allowed to cross to reach them?

283
00:36:53,967 --> 00:36:55,559
Then Camus replies:

284
00:36:55,727 --> 00:36:59,879
"Between my mother and my country
I choose my mother."

285
00:37:00,047 --> 00:37:03,835
He thinks that his mother
could be in the bus.

286
00:37:07,727 --> 00:37:10,799
Is everything alright with Delphine?
- Yes, it is.

287
00:37:11,327 --> 00:37:13,682
That does not sound very convincing

288
00:37:18,567 --> 00:37:20,637
If you want to talk, go ahead.

289
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:24,880
What is it?

290
00:37:27,847 --> 00:37:29,599
I'm afraid that ...

291
00:37:30,087 --> 00:37:33,875
Afraid of what? Don't be afraid!
We have no secrets from each other.

292
00:37:34,647 --> 00:37:37,036
I think I'm going too fast.

293
00:37:37,207 --> 00:37:39,038
I think she does not have orgasms

294
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,804
and I can not ...

295
00:37:41,967 --> 00:37:44,276
You can not last longer.
- Yes.

296
00:37:44,447 --> 00:37:46,677
This is normal in the beginning.

297
00:37:47,327 --> 00:37:49,443
You lack experience, that's all.

298
00:37:49,607 --> 00:37:52,519
Sexuality is like all the rest,
you still have to learn.

299
00:37:53,367 --> 00:37:58,236
How can you please a woman with good sex
if you've never touched one?

300
00:38:01,847 --> 00:38:03,565
That's impossible.

301
00:38:03,727 --> 00:38:07,322
This takes time.
You should try experimenting.

302
00:38:10,527 --> 00:38:12,279
Nathalie can explain a few things.

303
00:38:12,447 --> 00:38:14,802
If I had someone with more experience
when I was your age,

304
00:38:14,967 --> 00:38:17,083
it would have saved me a lot of problems.

305
00:38:41,047 --> 00:38:44,278
What is super important is foreplay.

306
00:38:45,487 --> 00:38:48,797
Do you think you can make a woman
cum even without penetrating her?

307
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:51,522
I can do that anyway. You, I do not know.

308
00:38:58,607 --> 00:39:01,883
And Delphine,

309
00:39:02,047 --> 00:39:04,845
has she rather vaginal
or clitoral orgasms?

310
00:39:05,167 --> 00:39:06,725
I don't know.

311
00:39:08,567 --> 00:39:11,400
When you are inside her,
do you feel contractions?

312
00:39:11,567 --> 00:39:13,125
I don't know.

313
00:39:15,447 --> 00:39:19,235
If she twitches,
she is vaginal.

314
00:39:20,647 --> 00:39:23,844
Nathalie has no contractions,
she's looking for years already.

315
00:39:29,487 --> 00:39:32,604
Do you know what a clitoris is?
- Of course.

316
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:40,446
I hate to ask,
but do you still have your foreskin?

317
00:39:40,607 --> 00:39:43,041
My what?
- Your foreskin.

318
00:39:43,767 --> 00:39:46,520
I ask you that because they cut
Didier his foreskin

319
00:39:46,687 --> 00:39:48,803
making it less sensitive
so he lasts longer.

320
00:39:48,967 --> 00:39:50,958
If you still have your foreskin,

321
00:39:51,127 --> 00:39:54,563
it is normal that you're so quickly to cum,
you're more sensitive.

322
00:39:55,247 --> 00:39:59,638
But what is super important when having sex

323
00:39:59,807 --> 00:40:02,799
is that you are relaxed, otherwise

324
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:04,844
it is normal that you cum too quick.

325
00:40:07,207 --> 00:40:10,358
It's hard to relax,
as she is always below you.

326
00:40:13,807 --> 00:40:17,243
If you are in her,
you must ask the right questions.

327
00:40:30,687 --> 00:40:33,201
Come on, come to me?
- It's okay.

328
00:40:34,527 --> 00:40:37,280
But no, come here.
- Let me do it.

329
00:40:39,767 --> 00:40:42,361
Come.
- But why?

330
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,724
Didn't you like it?
- Yeah, that's not it.

331
00:40:48,167 --> 00:40:49,680
It was good, right?

332
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:52,601
Yes, but I want you to cum inside me.

333
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:54,758
Let me continue, it will do you good.

334
00:40:54,927 --> 00:40:57,077
No, Jonas.
- But let me do it.

335
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:58,839
I don't want to.

336
00:41:07,927 --> 00:41:09,599
Do you feel anything?

337
00:41:10,687 --> 00:41:14,316
Yes, but I just want you to cum inside me.

338
00:41:27,127 --> 00:41:30,403
Here! Do you take that?
- Yes.

339
00:41:34,887 --> 00:41:38,402
Put it straight into the freezer?
- Okay.

340
00:41:39,567 --> 00:41:41,000
Good?

341
00:41:44,847 --> 00:41:48,078
What's for dinner tonight?
- Chicken croquettes, okay?

342
00:41:48,247 --> 00:41:50,044
Yes, great.

343
00:41:57,127 --> 00:41:59,163
We have found a working method.

344
00:42:00,567 --> 00:42:02,956
It's really cool.

345
00:42:06,847 --> 00:42:08,883
I don't know how to thank you.

346
00:42:11,287 --> 00:42:12,686
I owe you a favor.

347
00:42:12,847 --> 00:42:15,156
Hold on, Pascale.
- No.

348
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:18,359
You have food prepared for us,
that is very good.

349
00:42:23,647 --> 00:42:25,956
And have you seen your Italian again?
- Shut up about that.

350
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:28,687
What?
- Thanks for that formidable plan!

351
00:42:28,847 --> 00:42:31,281
Want some wine?
- Who is that Italian?

352
00:42:31,447 --> 00:42:33,836
It was your idea, no?

353
00:42:36,407 --> 00:42:39,763
It is really fun going back
to studying this curriculum,

354
00:42:40,367 --> 00:42:42,676
teaching Jonas. Really enjoyable.

355
00:42:44,487 --> 00:42:46,603
Make him work hard.

356
00:42:48,087 --> 00:42:51,159
If he doesn't work, then call me, okay?

357
00:42:52,967 --> 00:42:54,559
I am confident.

358
00:42:59,527 --> 00:43:01,916
And you accepted Tommaso's gift?

359
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:05,561
No, and you know it.

360
00:43:05,727 --> 00:43:08,446
Why?
- Because you don't accept something like that.

361
00:43:08,607 --> 00:43:11,121
Yes you do.
- No, not if it happens like this.

362
00:43:11,287 --> 00:43:13,403
What does that mean?
- Who is this Tommaso?

363
00:43:13,567 --> 00:43:15,125
Nothing, a ...

364
00:43:15,447 --> 00:43:17,358
moronic ...

365
00:43:18,007 --> 00:43:20,805
Italian ...
- Not a moron, very generous.

366
00:43:20,967 --> 00:43:22,878
Didier introduced me to him.

367
00:43:26,727 --> 00:43:28,922
Yes, that's correct.

368
00:43:35,207 --> 00:43:36,481
Pierre,

369
00:43:37,447 --> 00:43:39,915
would you like a drink?
- Yes, please.

370
00:43:55,927 --> 00:43:57,326
Thank you.

371
00:44:15,687 --> 00:44:17,120
Big kiss.

372
00:44:18,367 --> 00:44:21,564
Work hard, huh?
- Yes.

373
00:44:24,087 --> 00:44:26,920
If there's anything, you'll call me, okay?

374
00:45:19,807 --> 00:45:22,446
We'll leave it at that.

375
00:45:30,767 --> 00:45:33,645
The written examination was bad,
why should it go better now?

376
00:45:33,807 --> 00:45:35,206
No, wait! I know this.

377
00:45:35,367 --> 00:45:38,757
You must know your material better.
- 2 minutes, please.

378
00:45:38,927 --> 00:45:41,600
Sorry, there are still candidates waiting.

379
00:45:49,687 --> 00:45:52,247
Goodbye.
- Work well.

380
00:46:05,447 --> 00:46:07,677
And it's still the 1st test.

381
00:46:08,927 --> 00:46:11,680
It's like tennis.
You put yourself under too much pressure.

382
00:46:14,767 --> 00:46:16,678
It's not a race, Jonas.

383
00:46:18,327 --> 00:46:20,283
You'll get there at your own rhythm.

384
00:46:22,847 --> 00:46:24,883
You will become tired.

385
00:46:25,047 --> 00:46:28,323
But no, I know very well
that it will take time.

386
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:32,803
And it's not because you're not capable.

387
00:46:35,087 --> 00:46:37,999
Think you can just absorb
3 years of material at once?

388
00:46:40,727 --> 00:46:42,399
You're not Superman.

389
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:45,358
Nobody expects you to be.

390
00:46:49,607 --> 00:46:53,646
You did not get the necessary help for years.
You don't fix that at once.

391
00:46:57,367 --> 00:46:58,925
Did you call your mom?

392
00:46:59,967 --> 00:47:01,525
What did she tell you?

393
00:47:01,807 --> 00:47:04,002
I should not lower my courage.

394
00:47:06,727 --> 00:47:08,445
Do not worry.

395
00:47:10,807 --> 00:47:13,401
I know very well
what I started.

396
00:47:15,607 --> 00:47:18,758
I especially don't want

397
00:47:19,167 --> 00:47:20,998
that you doubt yourself.

398
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,800
Agree?

399
00:47:26,087 --> 00:47:27,486
Come on!

400
00:47:28,207 --> 00:47:31,517
You're lucky that someone with a lot of patience
deals with you.

401
00:47:34,607 --> 00:47:36,563
Do not wear blinders,

402
00:47:37,407 --> 00:47:41,798
don't believe in a religion
that makes you empty promises,

403
00:47:42,607 --> 00:47:44,518
don't blindly follow a moral

404
00:47:44,687 --> 00:47:47,326
that imposes you a way of life
that you have not chosen.

405
00:47:48,127 --> 00:47:49,924
That's revolt!

406
00:47:50,407 --> 00:47:53,843
Remain conscious,

407
00:47:54,007 --> 00:47:57,079
Always look at things more closely.

408
00:47:59,287 --> 00:48:03,485
Example, if I tell you:
You must love your parents?

409
00:48:04,767 --> 00:48:06,325
Yes.

410
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,400
Why?

411
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:10,997
Because they have put us on the world.

412
00:48:11,927 --> 00:48:14,839
And because they did,

413
00:48:15,287 --> 00:48:18,597
they deserve a life of respect
that you shouldn't doubt?

414
00:48:20,727 --> 00:48:22,399
Yeah, maybe.

415
00:48:23,287 --> 00:48:25,881
No, wait, if you consciously think that,
that's okay.

416
00:48:26,047 --> 00:48:30,404
But if you're just applying an imposed
morality, I do not agree.

417
00:48:32,207 --> 00:48:34,402
Someone can have very good reasons
to hate his parents.

418
00:48:34,567 --> 00:48:37,161
If he doesn't do it for external reasons,

419
00:48:37,327 --> 00:48:41,445
he is not aware,
and certainly not a rebellious man.

420
00:48:42,087 --> 00:48:45,443
Later we have a chapter
on Don Juan.

421
00:48:49,127 --> 00:48:51,516
In your eyes, is he a decent man?

422
00:48:53,527 --> 00:48:55,119
Yes.

423
00:48:56,407 --> 00:48:58,284
What did you think honestly?

424
00:48:59,247 --> 00:49:00,521
No.

425
00:49:00,967 --> 00:49:04,243
Why?
- Because he runs after all the girls.

426
00:49:04,407 --> 00:49:05,806
Is that bad?

427
00:49:07,167 --> 00:49:09,806
Wait, I ask the question differently:

428
00:49:09,967 --> 00:49:12,481
Is that necessarily bad?

429
00:49:14,847 --> 00:49:16,200
No.

430
00:49:18,807 --> 00:49:22,004
What does Camus say? That we,
faced with an absurd world,

431
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:25,876
have to live as intensely as possible
use all that is given to us,

432
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:29,642
challenge the world,
experience as many experiences.

433
00:49:29,807 --> 00:49:35,040
No imposed limits or prohibitions,
because borders are totally artificial.

434
00:49:35,207 --> 00:49:39,405
He says: "Every healthy creature
attempts to reproduce."

435
00:49:40,127 --> 00:49:43,039
And so does Don Juan. He experiences
various love affairs very intensely

436
00:49:43,207 --> 00:49:45,437
rather then reduce himself to a single passion.

437
00:49:45,967 --> 00:49:49,516
I want to read you a passage.

438
00:49:50,327 --> 00:49:54,320
Listen: "The only generous love

439
00:49:54,487 --> 00:49:58,082
is the one who realizes that she's both
volatile and particular at once.

440
00:49:58,247 --> 00:50:02,604
These are all the endings and rebirths
that constitute Don Juan's life.

441
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:05,725
That is his way
to give and let live.

442
00:50:05,887 --> 00:50:09,243
Everyone can judge whether or not
this is selfishness.

443
00:50:16,607 --> 00:50:18,802
Well, it's late. We go to sleep.

444
00:50:20,207 --> 00:50:22,926
Think about it?
- Yes.

445
00:51:05,967 --> 00:51:07,923
You should not feel obligated.

446
00:51:08,847 --> 00:51:11,315
Really, I'd prefer that you work.

447
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:32,364
That's for you.

448
00:51:33,527 --> 00:51:36,564
Are you crazy?
- It's my pleasure.

449
00:51:43,807 --> 00:51:46,037
Would you like lasagna?

450
00:51:50,527 --> 00:51:53,644
Lasagne?
- Yes.

451
00:52:04,727 --> 00:52:06,285
You're crazy!

452
00:52:23,087 --> 00:52:24,679
It's his last novel.

453
00:52:25,247 --> 00:52:28,478
But he died
before he could finish it.

454
00:52:28,647 --> 00:52:32,083
It is about his childhood in Algiers.

455
00:52:33,047 --> 00:52:36,357
He lived with his mother and grandmother
because his father died when he was one.

456
00:52:36,527 --> 00:52:41,078
His mother could neither read nor write
and they had no books at home.

457
00:52:42,567 --> 00:52:45,001
His mother did not even want him to study.

458
00:52:45,807 --> 00:52:50,005
But when his teacher saw
he was super intelligent,

459
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:53,523
He has paid his studies.

460
00:52:54,967 --> 00:52:58,084
Thanks to him, he was awarded the Nobel Prize.

461
00:52:58,247 --> 00:53:03,116
When he received it,
He wrote a letter to thank him.

462
00:53:04,007 --> 00:53:08,603
The letter is at the back of the book.
It's beautiful.

463
00:53:14,807 --> 00:53:16,559
You can borrow others too

464
00:53:17,807 --> 00:53:20,605
if you like to read it.
I have them all.

465
00:53:20,967 --> 00:53:22,320
Thank you.

466
00:53:45,447 --> 00:53:49,281
I don't know,
I have not actually felt much.

467
00:53:55,047 --> 00:53:57,003
Maybe she doesn't know how.

468
00:54:01,527 --> 00:54:03,995
A good fellatio is not that easy.

469
00:54:04,807 --> 00:54:06,160
Yes,

470
00:54:07,847 --> 00:54:09,724
or maybe I have a problem.

471
00:54:13,447 --> 00:54:17,201
That you can only know if you do it
with someone who has more experience.

472
00:54:17,367 --> 00:54:19,198
Otherwise, it's impossible.

473
00:54:20,167 --> 00:54:23,842
But I can't find someone
else to do it.

474
00:54:24,727 --> 00:54:26,399
I understand that.

475
00:54:30,647 --> 00:54:32,080
Anyway ...

476
00:54:32,687 --> 00:54:36,566
It would be stupid if your relation would
end because of sexual problems, no?

477
00:54:43,687 --> 00:54:47,646
4 NH35 O2. Yes.

478
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:50,037
4 NO. Okay. Super.

479
00:54:50,207 --> 00:54:54,359
There, that is 18 +2.

480
00:54:54,527 --> 00:54:56,245
Yes. All right.

481
00:54:56,527 --> 00:54:58,643
Will you continue?
- Yes.

482
00:55:03,327 --> 00:55:05,397
You like that actress?

483
00:55:06,127 --> 00:55:07,640
Yes, she's okay.

484
00:55:13,047 --> 00:55:14,560
And her?

485
00:55:15,767 --> 00:55:18,076
Yeah, you like her.

486
00:55:22,087 --> 00:55:25,796
Pierre has explained it a little.

487
00:55:28,607 --> 00:55:31,405
If you want, I want to try to see
if everything is okay.

488
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:37,203
It is only to check

489
00:55:37,607 --> 00:55:40,724
if there is a problem with you or ...

490
00:55:41,367 --> 00:55:43,358
Perhaps with Delphine, I don't know.

491
00:55:45,167 --> 00:55:48,523
And Didier?
- He doesn't care.

492
00:55:49,047 --> 00:55:52,642
He doesn't care?
- No.

493
00:55:53,527 --> 00:55:57,281
It's not because you occasionally cheat,
that you don't love each other.

494
00:55:59,807 --> 00:56:02,605
Well, it's like you want.
I just want to help.

495
00:57:08,207 --> 00:57:11,119
You should not be embarrassed.
It does not matter.

496
00:57:12,727 --> 00:57:15,002
I leave them on my rack for you to watch.

497
00:57:42,087 --> 00:57:44,647
Find the limit of that function.

498
00:57:46,527 --> 00:57:49,246
How can you find it?

499
00:57:51,567 --> 00:57:53,523
By determining the derivative.

500
00:58:02,207 --> 00:58:05,005
Jonas, what do you think of Nathalie?

501
00:58:05,327 --> 00:58:08,239
Handsome.
- Yes.

502
00:58:09,847 --> 00:58:13,522
I believed you thought she's ugly.
- No, why?

503
00:58:15,487 --> 00:58:17,205
I don't know ...

504
00:58:19,727 --> 00:58:22,446
It doesn't matter,
I have no problem with that.

505
00:58:28,287 --> 00:58:31,006
What is cheating someone for you?

506
00:58:32,007 --> 00:58:35,443
I do not know,
go to bed with someone else.

507
00:58:36,047 --> 00:58:39,119
Are you sure?
- Yes.

508
00:58:41,007 --> 00:58:42,838
I think it's not.

509
00:58:46,807 --> 00:58:50,197
For me, someone is cheating,

510
00:58:50,887 --> 00:58:53,640
if he stays with that person
without wanting that.

511
00:58:54,327 --> 00:58:55,919
What do you mean?

512
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,961
Well, the guy who always dreams
to be with another woman,

513
00:59:00,127 --> 00:59:02,243
but who never does it because he's afraid.

514
00:59:02,607 --> 00:59:04,598
To me he is unfaithful,

515
00:59:04,767 --> 00:59:07,122
while the guy who's in a good relationship
with his wife,

516
00:59:07,287 --> 00:59:10,006
but occasionally does it with someone else

517
00:59:10,607 --> 00:59:12,757
is not necessary unfaithful I think.

518
00:59:14,847 --> 00:59:19,796
Besides, in your case
it's sex education,

519
00:59:19,967 --> 00:59:21,923
it's not even about greed.

520
00:59:24,487 --> 00:59:27,126
But it's when my father
began to cheat,

521
00:59:27,287 --> 00:59:29,437
that it went wrong with my mother.

522
00:59:31,127 --> 00:59:35,325
That might be because he does not distinguish
between love and sexuality.

523
00:59:37,007 --> 00:59:39,157
I would not cheat on Delphine.

524
00:59:42,367 --> 00:59:47,282
Okay. If you don't want to do anything with
Nathalie, no one will force you.

525
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:50,237
I'm not going to rape you.

526
00:59:56,087 --> 00:59:59,045
We might be able to show you things.

527
01:00:00,487 --> 01:00:02,205
Just looking, that's okay.

528
01:00:05,127 --> 01:00:09,040
When you watched a porn movie,

529
01:00:09,847 --> 01:00:12,645
you didn't cheat on Delphine.
- No.

530
01:00:13,967 --> 01:00:16,003
This is the same.

531
01:00:16,607 --> 01:00:20,043
But without a screen.

532
01:00:23,807 --> 01:00:25,479
See?

533
01:00:26,327 --> 01:00:28,761
Moreover, Didier and Nathalie like that.

534
01:01:24,407 --> 01:01:26,841
It is important that
you say what you like.

535
01:01:28,727 --> 01:01:31,844
Whether you want her to jack you off
or suck you right away.

536
01:01:34,407 --> 01:01:38,161
You see, while ... you're in her mouth,
she needs to continue to jack you.

537
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:41,080
Softly, in the same rhythm.

538
01:01:44,047 --> 01:01:46,481
If you want her to slow down,
you tell her.

539
01:01:46,647 --> 01:01:48,638
Or that she firmly grips you,

540
01:01:48,807 --> 01:01:51,879
or with a continuous motion.
That is especially good in the beginning.

541
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:57,636
She can caress your balls.

542
01:01:57,807 --> 01:02:01,402
If you don't want to say it,
you just lay her hand on your balls.

543
01:02:01,567 --> 01:02:05,446
So. Gently.

544
01:02:20,967 --> 01:02:24,801
And when she enters?
- But no, she will not come.

545
01:02:39,887 --> 01:02:41,923
You will like it.

546
01:02:42,607 --> 01:02:44,404
What are you doing?

547
01:02:44,887 --> 01:02:46,525
Let me.

548
01:02:54,967 --> 01:02:56,764
Hold on, hold on.

549
01:02:57,207 --> 01:02:58,720
Why?

550
01:03:06,807 --> 01:03:08,559
I'm sorry.

551
01:03:17,687 --> 01:03:20,884
You don't have much experience.
- No.

552
01:03:25,207 --> 01:03:28,358
Does it bother you that we talk about it?
Then you have to say.

553
01:03:31,047 --> 01:03:32,878
No, it's okay.

554
01:03:39,087 --> 01:03:43,717
At your age I also was ...
- Nervous?

555
01:03:46,207 --> 01:03:49,483
No, but I was not at ease.

556
01:03:53,447 --> 01:03:55,836
The pleasure does not come easily.

557
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:00,960
You should be well supervised.

558
01:04:01,127 --> 01:04:04,881
You have to dare to let go,
you have to trust each other.

559
01:04:05,047 --> 01:04:06,400
It's not that simple.

560
01:04:11,047 --> 01:04:13,117
It's all normal.

561
01:04:14,207 --> 01:04:17,722
That will gradually be okay.

562
01:04:18,967 --> 01:04:20,286
You know,

563
01:04:21,207 --> 01:04:24,199
if you need advice, ask me.
I'm here for you.

564
01:04:32,287 --> 01:04:33,845
Fine by me.

565
01:04:44,647 --> 01:04:46,683
What is it?
- What did you tell them?

566
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:49,077
Nothing!
- Yeah, right.

567
01:04:52,247 --> 01:04:54,238
Delphine, come on. Wait.
- No, I must go.

568
01:04:54,407 --> 01:04:55,806
It's okay.

569
01:04:56,047 --> 01:04:59,005
What are you doing? Stay!
- No, I don't want to.

570
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:25,485
The coordinates of the four points?

571
01:05:33,207 --> 01:05:35,163
Concentrate, will you?

572
01:05:37,047 --> 01:05:38,480
Excuse me.

573
01:05:46,887 --> 01:05:48,445
What's up?

574
01:05:49,887 --> 01:05:51,286
Nothing.

575
01:06:01,007 --> 01:06:04,841
She'll call you. She panicked.
You have to understand her.

576
01:06:08,647 --> 01:06:11,400
But you should not run after her.

577
01:06:13,727 --> 01:06:15,319
Let her come back.

578
01:06:18,127 --> 01:06:19,845
And concentrate now.

579
01:06:20,687 --> 01:06:22,279
Reread the problem.

580
01:06:26,247 --> 01:06:30,638
Specify on the graph points A 'B' C 'D',

581
01:06:30,807 --> 01:06:34,163
the respective image of A, B, C, D
by the orthogonal symmetry

582
01:06:34,327 --> 01:06:38,036
the axis of which is the straight line of the quotients,
Y is equal to X.

583
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:40,163
And give their coordinates.

584
01:07:01,007 --> 01:07:02,520
I don't understand.

585
01:07:05,447 --> 01:07:08,644
I have to concentrate on my work.

586
01:07:10,007 --> 01:07:12,043
I don't prevent you from working.

587
01:07:19,807 --> 01:07:21,763
Is it because of that night?

588
01:07:30,407 --> 01:07:32,204
What have I done?

589
01:07:33,167 --> 01:07:36,955
You've done nothing.
- Why are you so changed?

590
01:07:38,727 --> 01:07:41,924
I'm no different.
- Yes you are.

591
01:07:47,207 --> 01:07:49,562
I have to work, that's all.

592
01:08:00,487 --> 01:08:02,079
Work well.

593
01:08:19,647 --> 01:08:21,797
After a week you won't think about it anymore.

594
01:08:26,887 --> 01:08:29,799
You will see, you will still
have enough adventures.

595
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:34,077
It is simply because you are evolving faster
than your peers.

596
01:08:35,607 --> 01:08:37,723
It's normal that they're less interesting.

597
01:08:39,927 --> 01:08:41,565
Now you have to ...

598
01:08:47,007 --> 01:08:50,795
You have to concentrate,
otherwise it will not work.

599
01:08:50,967 --> 01:08:53,959
But it doesn't matter.
It's normal, it's the 1st time.

600
01:08:54,687 --> 01:08:57,565
It's normal that you want to believe
you're in love.

601
01:09:00,167 --> 01:09:03,523
But you will see later, you will laugh.

602
01:09:07,447 --> 01:09:10,007
You can't spoil everything
for the sake of a little adventure.

603
01:09:10,887 --> 01:09:12,206
That's it.

604
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:39,238
Is it correct?
- Yes.

605
01:09:39,407 --> 01:09:41,602
Really?
- Yes, it's perfect.

606
01:09:45,407 --> 01:09:47,398
Bravo.
- Goodbye.

607
01:09:49,687 --> 01:09:52,520
And good luck with the rest.
- Thank you.

608
01:09:57,127 --> 01:10:01,359
Your hand down on the handle.
Turn it a little more to the right.

609
01:10:01,807 --> 01:10:02,956
Okay.
- Like this?

610
01:10:03,127 --> 01:10:04,685
Come on, you. Concentrate
- Okay.

611
01:10:04,847 --> 01:10:06,724
Move, move.
- Okay.

612
01:10:06,887 --> 01:10:08,559
Calm down.
- What?

613
01:10:08,727 --> 01:10:11,241
Why do you hit so hard? Easy.
- Okay.

614
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:13,796
Wait, wait, a service,
here, Pierre.

615
01:10:15,247 --> 01:10:17,078
Forward. Calm down.

616
01:10:19,687 --> 01:10:22,406
What are you doing? More serious.
- Okay.

617
01:10:22,567 --> 01:10:24,842
Come on, yeah. Forward.

618
01:10:26,567 --> 01:10:28,046
That's better.
- Yeah, last one, quickly.

619
01:10:28,207 --> 01:10:30,243
What? Come on. Okay.
- Come on.

620
01:10:30,407 --> 01:10:31,965
Hi, Bernard.

621
01:10:32,487 --> 01:10:34,523
Okay, just stop.

622
01:10:41,727 --> 01:10:43,399
Hi, Jonas.
- Hello.

623
01:10:44,167 --> 01:10:45,486
Hi.

624
01:10:46,927 --> 01:10:48,076
Hello.

625
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:54,406
And?
- Success.

626
01:10:54,567 --> 01:10:56,000
Super.

627
01:11:01,207 --> 01:11:05,598
Bernard, Jonas has passed math.
- Bravo, Jonas.

628
01:11:09,007 --> 01:11:12,966
On your success, Jonas.
- Same for chemistry.

629
01:11:15,407 --> 01:11:19,002
Here, this is for you.

630
01:11:20,167 --> 01:11:21,316
You're crazy.
- Thank you.

631
01:11:21,487 --> 01:11:23,876
We are spoiled.
- I'm fond of gifts.

632
01:11:26,567 --> 01:11:30,162
Yours is great.
- It's bigger, yes.

633
01:11:33,767 --> 01:11:37,362
Thanks, it's fantastic.
Thanks, Jonas.

634
01:11:38,047 --> 01:11:39,639
Thanks, Jonas.

635
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:42,446
Thank you.

636
01:11:46,207 --> 01:11:47,606
Thank you.

637
01:11:48,927 --> 01:11:50,440
What is it?

638
01:11:51,647 --> 01:11:53,922
No, you are thanked.
- For what?

639
01:11:54,087 --> 01:11:56,203
What you have done for me.

640
01:11:56,367 --> 01:11:59,439
It's not done yet, Jonas.

641
01:12:00,327 --> 01:12:01,919
Come on.

642
01:12:02,167 --> 01:12:05,125
Well, to your discoveries and ...

643
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:07,801
to freedom.
- And to freedom, right.

644
01:13:54,607 --> 01:13:56,165
It was strong, huh?

645
01:13:57,207 --> 01:13:58,879
Yeah, it was good.

646
01:14:04,167 --> 01:14:06,681
And what if I would say that
Didier was the one sucking you?

647
01:14:07,207 --> 01:14:09,960
How would you respond?
- I don't know ...

648
01:14:12,807 --> 01:14:14,957
Well, Didier blew you.

649
01:14:19,407 --> 01:14:22,399
You get the best blowjobs from other men.

650
01:14:37,327 --> 01:14:39,443
And Didier?

651
01:14:39,967 --> 01:14:42,003
Is he ... homosexual?

652
01:14:44,127 --> 01:14:45,640
What do you think?

653
01:14:46,207 --> 01:14:48,038
Nathalie is a boy?

654
01:14:50,527 --> 01:14:53,519
It's not because you act homosexual
that you're gay.

655
01:14:58,007 --> 01:15:00,999
I think we really
are all bisexual.

656
01:15:01,727 --> 01:15:03,718
Then it's a matter of choice.

657
01:15:06,607 --> 01:15:09,246
There are curious and courageous people
and there are others.

658
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:14,397
The weak, who tell make believe stories
and lie to themselves.

659
01:15:17,527 --> 01:15:21,042
We are afraid of our natural
curiosity to approach one another.

660
01:15:21,847 --> 01:15:26,204
But disapproval, inhibition,
that makes no difference.

661
01:15:28,167 --> 01:15:29,725
Whatever you do,

662
01:15:30,407 --> 01:15:33,717
where there is fear, there is desire.

663
01:15:36,727 --> 01:15:41,005
Yeah, but I'm not attracted
to boys.

664
01:15:42,127 --> 01:15:44,687
How can you say that
if you haven't tried it?

665
01:15:49,087 --> 01:15:53,239
People who claim to be straight, without ever
trying to do something, make me laugh.

666
01:15:59,287 --> 01:16:02,484
How can you say in a restaurant
whether a dish is good or bad,

667
01:16:02,647 --> 01:16:04,205
if you have not tasted it?

668
01:16:08,847 --> 01:16:12,556
When Didier blew you, it was the same
as with Nathalie. You noticed no difference.

669
01:16:14,087 --> 01:16:16,601
But I'm not attracted to them.

670
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:18,997
If I see a boy, I feel nothing.

671
01:16:19,167 --> 01:16:22,125
No, wait. I understand that.
I was like you.

672
01:16:24,207 --> 01:16:26,721
Then, I started to doubt.

673
01:16:31,527 --> 01:16:35,645
I needed to experience things first to
understand. I have evolved, and then ...

674
01:16:35,807 --> 01:16:37,604
It's true, I've started
experiencing too late and ...

675
01:16:37,767 --> 01:16:40,406
that's why I feel like I messed up my
childhood a little, but ...

676
01:16:41,687 --> 01:16:45,157
But you ask yourself these question already,
so you're not far from the answer.

677
01:16:46,567 --> 01:16:48,956
But at your age
I didn't have your maturity.

678
01:16:54,847 --> 01:16:58,362
And you, do you sometimes have relationships
or are you gay?

679
01:16:59,047 --> 01:17:00,719
No, I'm not gay.

680
01:17:03,367 --> 01:17:06,484
What annoys me are men who act
like they are women.

681
01:17:13,007 --> 01:17:14,963
When I was your age,

682
01:17:17,407 --> 01:17:19,238
I was madly in love with a girl.

683
01:17:25,607 --> 01:17:27,438
She was the woman of my dreams.

684
01:17:28,807 --> 01:17:30,399
And then she was gone.

685
01:17:34,487 --> 01:17:37,763
After that I never felt the same.

686
01:17:39,807 --> 01:17:44,198
But good. There is something that I ...
There is something of great importance.

687
01:17:44,367 --> 01:17:47,484
And that is that sex and feelings

688
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:49,683
are very different things.

689
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:55,600
I think that sex
is not that important.

690
01:17:58,167 --> 01:18:00,522
You have to keep it in the right place.

691
01:18:46,007 --> 01:18:47,565
Okay, Jonas?

692
01:18:48,087 --> 01:18:49,645
I've had enough of it.

693
01:19:04,927 --> 01:19:06,997
You should occasionally relax.

694
01:19:08,367 --> 01:19:10,164
Otherwise, you can not hold on.

695
01:19:41,967 --> 01:19:43,685
Calm down.

696
01:19:45,167 --> 01:19:46,998
It's like with Didier.

697
01:20:26,167 --> 01:20:27,964
Let yourself go.

698
01:21:35,167 --> 01:21:38,398
Can you check that, please?
- Yes.

699
01:22:02,567 --> 01:22:06,116
"Moment" is neuter, so ...

700
01:22:06,287 --> 01:22:07,879
It is "it".

701
01:22:11,367 --> 01:22:12,925
Where are you?

702
01:22:14,527 --> 01:22:16,119
Yeah, shit.

703
01:22:19,087 --> 01:22:21,396
No, but that's okay, Pascale.

704
01:22:22,447 --> 01:22:24,358
That's okay.

705
01:22:25,647 --> 01:22:28,844
Listen, here everything is fine.
I am super happy.

706
01:22:29,007 --> 01:22:30,725
He works very well.

707
01:22:32,487 --> 01:22:35,797
Yes, yes, but don't worry.
Really.

708
01:22:37,127 --> 01:22:39,163
Okay, I'll ask him.

709
01:22:39,847 --> 01:22:43,476
I will tell him that you called.
If anything, you call me.

710
01:22:44,367 --> 01:22:45,720
Okay?

711
01:22:46,247 --> 01:22:48,522
See you later. Yes.

712
01:22:52,407 --> 01:22:54,125
What does she want now?

713
01:22:54,687 --> 01:22:56,996
You should call her back.

714
01:22:57,167 --> 01:22:59,442
She quarreled with her boss.

715
01:23:00,047 --> 01:23:01,958
She went home.

716
01:23:08,327 --> 01:23:09,999
Okay, sweetie?

717
01:23:13,047 --> 01:23:14,685
Am I interrupting?

718
01:23:15,007 --> 01:23:16,599
What is it?

719
01:23:17,007 --> 01:23:21,239
Nothing. I'm just visiting.

720
01:23:25,607 --> 01:23:27,120
May I come in?

721
01:23:38,807 --> 01:23:40,399
Are you alone?

722
01:23:40,767 --> 01:23:41,995
Yes.

723
01:23:45,207 --> 01:23:47,675
Why don't you come see me?
I don't understand.

724
01:23:48,127 --> 01:23:51,085
I have exams.
It's a little complicated.

725
01:23:52,767 --> 01:23:54,883
I would like to have you at home.

726
01:24:08,127 --> 01:24:12,006
Do you have it good here?
- Yes, it's good.

727
01:24:13,567 --> 01:24:15,205
What is it?

728
01:24:15,687 --> 01:24:17,086
Nothing.

729
01:24:19,567 --> 01:24:22,320
Do you eat well?
- Yes.

730
01:24:22,487 --> 01:24:25,047
You can give me your laundry if you want.
- Mom, stop it.

731
01:24:25,207 --> 01:24:27,402
What do you mean, "stop"!

732
01:24:33,487 --> 01:24:35,603
Don't you miss the garden?

733
01:24:36,687 --> 01:24:38,086
No.

734
01:24:39,807 --> 01:24:44,005
What is it, I do have the right to see you?

735
01:24:44,487 --> 01:24:46,523
Yes, but not here.

736
01:24:47,287 --> 01:24:49,482
Okay, you come to me.

737
01:24:50,567 --> 01:24:52,319
If I have time.

738
01:24:58,007 --> 01:25:00,043
You're gonna get some fresh air
from time to time?

739
01:25:00,607 --> 01:25:02,563
I've got a lot of work, Mom.

740
01:25:03,967 --> 01:25:06,845
I have the impression that you ...
That you don't realize it.

741
01:25:08,487 --> 01:25:10,443
Do you know what it takes,
to succeed for the exam committee?

742
01:25:13,127 --> 01:25:15,038
I have to continue working.

743
01:25:19,247 --> 01:25:21,807
Here, give it to Pierre.

744
01:25:23,567 --> 01:25:27,640
What will you do?
- I'm fine.

745
01:25:29,007 --> 01:25:31,726
Take care of yourself, okay?

746
01:26:02,607 --> 01:26:05,326
How was your day?
- Fine.

747
01:26:05,727 --> 01:26:07,683
My mother came by.

748
01:26:10,767 --> 01:26:13,804
What did she have to say?
- Baloney.

749
01:26:20,047 --> 01:26:21,924
Here, she has given this for you.

750
01:26:23,567 --> 01:26:24,966
Thank you.

751
01:26:36,607 --> 01:26:38,325
What's that money for?

752
01:26:39,327 --> 01:26:41,443
I don't know, it's for you.

753
01:26:44,287 --> 01:26:47,245
She gives you nothing, and I get money
while I don't need it?

754
01:26:48,127 --> 01:26:51,597
What does she think?
I don't do it for the money. Here, take it.

755
01:26:54,767 --> 01:26:58,077
What does she imagine?
I like her, but ...

756
01:27:02,407 --> 01:27:05,319
It's especially for you, that it hurts me.

757
01:27:07,327 --> 01:27:09,557
Are you coming to eat?

758
01:27:09,847 --> 01:27:11,678
Yes, I'm coming.

759
01:27:22,207 --> 01:27:23,720
Turn around, turn around.

760
01:27:23,887 --> 01:27:26,003
What?
- Turn around.

761
01:28:40,287 --> 01:28:42,437
We don't even talk to each other.

762
01:28:45,327 --> 01:28:47,477
I don't know how to approach it.

763
01:28:55,447 --> 01:28:57,438
Will you talk to him?

764
01:29:00,127 --> 01:29:03,085
If you want it, yes.

765
01:29:05,287 --> 01:29:07,437
To you, he will say what's up.

766
01:29:08,967 --> 01:29:10,320
And ...

767
01:29:15,087 --> 01:29:17,362
If he has had enough of me,
You tell me, huh?

768
01:29:31,767 --> 01:29:33,917
We don't see you anymore, Pierre,
that's too bad.

769
01:29:35,807 --> 01:29:37,559
It's a lot of work, though.

770
01:29:37,967 --> 01:29:41,039
Yes. You are not obliged
to spend your whole life with him.

771
01:29:41,207 --> 01:29:42,720
You're not his father.

772
01:29:43,087 --> 01:29:44,839
I have to finish it, that's all.

773
01:29:47,247 --> 01:29:50,000
The people begin to believe
that you're a couple.

774
01:29:52,767 --> 01:29:55,804
They think what they want.
I know very well what I'm doing.

775
01:29:59,847 --> 01:30:03,396
The introduction, I think that's super.

776
01:30:12,007 --> 01:30:14,237
Therefore, it's a pity ...

777
01:30:14,407 --> 01:30:17,399
Because your statement is a bit ...
- Okay, it's good.

778
01:30:29,647 --> 01:30:34,767
<i> The Government will only next year </i>
<i> consider the issue of a social VAT. </i>

779
01:30:34,927 --> 01:30:38,806
<i>Today we notice some </ i>
<i>hesitations, some steps backwards, </i>

780
01:30:38,967 --> 01:30:41,640
<i>an endless prevarication about </i>
<i>the second stage of reform? </i>

781
01:30:41,807 --> 01:30:46,562
<i>The relationship between the government and the public </i>
<i>opinion and the media is sometimes ambiguous. </i>

782
01:30:46,727 --> 01:30:50,879
<i>They accused the President </i>
<i>of going too fast, doing too much. </i>

783
01:30:51,047 --> 01:30:53,436
<i>Now they're blaming him </i>
<i>for blocking new ideas. </i>

784
01:30:53,607 --> 01:30:58,442
<i>There seems to be a need </i>
<i>for a clear economic policy ... </i>

785
01:31:03,527 --> 01:31:05,961
You know that the mass is equal to 32.

786
01:31:09,887 --> 01:31:11,559
What do you need then?

787
01:31:17,687 --> 01:31:21,726
Jonas, I'm asking you a question.
The mass is equal to 32.

788
01:31:31,767 --> 01:31:33,485
I have no idea.

789
01:31:34,407 --> 01:31:35,886
Damn.

790
01:31:36,407 --> 01:31:39,524
You have to be a moron
to study sciences.

791
01:31:40,447 --> 01:31:43,723
How could you be doing
five years of such bullshit?

792
01:31:50,367 --> 01:31:52,756
Okay, calm down, and we resume the exercise.

793
01:31:53,567 --> 01:31:56,240
All for a job that you dislike.

794
01:31:58,727 --> 01:32:01,799
You can only teach brats.

795
01:32:11,687 --> 01:32:15,282
I have already explained this 15 times.
Who is the moron then?

796
01:32:40,167 --> 01:32:41,520
Well,

797
01:32:42,367 --> 01:32:45,723
you calmed down?
We resume the exercise.

798
01:33:09,287 --> 01:33:10,640
Jonas?

799
01:33:11,887 --> 01:33:13,479
Leave me alone.

800
01:33:16,167 --> 01:33:18,044
Leave me alone, damn.

801
01:33:20,727 --> 01:33:23,924
You are disappointed, but that doesn't
mean you should talk to me like that.

802
01:33:24,887 --> 01:33:26,684
You know I've done everything
to make sure you would succeed.

803
01:33:26,847 --> 01:33:31,204
You don't care.

804
01:33:31,727 --> 01:33:33,763
That's not what interests you.

805
01:33:34,527 --> 01:33:35,880
What?

806
01:33:36,407 --> 01:33:40,400
You don't care if I succeed.
That's not what interests you.

807
01:33:42,287 --> 01:33:43,800
Stand up.

808
01:33:46,007 --> 01:33:48,123
Damn! Stand up,

809
01:33:48,527 --> 01:33:51,246
Let me go.
- And what interests me?

810
01:33:55,567 --> 01:33:57,558
You don't have the right to
speak to me like that.

811
01:34:00,087 --> 01:34:01,918
I did not deserve it.

812
01:34:24,247 --> 01:34:25,805
Okay, I'm listening.
<i>- Deze namiddag ik zal naar de sportclub gaan.</i>

813
01:34:27,967 --> 01:34:30,481
No, I told you that's not correct.

814
01:34:32,087 --> 01:34:36,365
What a fucking shitty language.
- If you get agitated, I quit.

815
01:34:37,047 --> 01:34:38,844
I'm not Pierre.

816
01:34:43,647 --> 01:34:47,322
Without him, you would be nowhere.
Therefore, calm down;

817
01:34:48,847 --> 01:34:50,644
He's not your dog.

818
01:34:51,167 --> 01:34:53,681
He is not obliged
to do all that for you.

819
01:34:59,367 --> 01:35:04,157
What is the first word of the sentence?
- No idea.

820
01:35:05,047 --> 01:35:06,685
Is it the subject?

821
01:35:07,247 --> 01:35:08,566
No.

822
01:35:08,727 --> 01:35:11,685
Well then, we often talked about this.
What is the rule?

823
01:35:14,447 --> 01:35:17,359
Conversion.
- So?

824
01:35:23,127 --> 01:35:25,004
And where does the infinitive go?

825
01:35:37,007 --> 01:35:38,486
Hi Jonas.

826
01:35:46,407 --> 01:35:47,840
Everything okay?

827
01:35:59,207 --> 01:36:02,677
What's happening?
- What are you going to tell?

828
01:36:03,727 --> 01:36:05,763
What do you mean, what am I going to tell?

829
01:36:06,287 --> 01:36:08,437
What did you say to Nathalie?

830
01:36:08,607 --> 01:36:10,677
Nothing, I told her what happened.
Nothing more.

831
01:36:10,847 --> 01:36:13,122
I also have my story to tell.

832
01:36:13,767 --> 01:36:15,644
Did you tell it to Nathalie?

833
01:36:16,287 --> 01:36:17,845
What then?

834
01:36:18,367 --> 01:36:20,437
You have abused me.

835
01:36:22,087 --> 01:36:23,918
Take it back immediately.

836
01:36:27,687 --> 01:36:29,564
Take it back immediately.

837
01:36:33,927 --> 01:36:35,918
Leave, I don't want to see you anymore.

838
01:36:39,247 --> 01:36:41,317
Do you know what abuse is?

839
01:36:42,887 --> 01:36:45,162
Ask the cops what abuse is.

840
01:36:46,047 --> 01:36:47,878
Poor victim.

841
01:36:51,087 --> 01:36:53,317
Why didn't you tell me
you're a faggot?

842
01:36:53,807 --> 01:36:56,162
Why didn't you tell me that?

843
01:36:56,487 --> 01:36:58,159
It's not bad, huh?

844
01:36:58,967 --> 01:37:01,162
I'm tired of everyone messing with me.

845
01:37:03,367 --> 01:37:05,198
I'll take you home.

846
01:37:05,367 --> 01:37:08,564
Let's go to your house.
You will see how it is there.

847
01:37:08,727 --> 01:37:10,718
Come on.

848
01:37:14,807 --> 01:37:17,196
I'll stay here,
I want to succeed for the exam committee.

849
01:37:20,287 --> 01:37:23,165
I didn't think you were so opportunistic.

850
01:37:26,367 --> 01:37:28,801
You're just a whore, Jonas.

851
01:37:31,527 --> 01:37:33,916
You can continue your exam committee alone.

852
01:37:34,607 --> 01:37:36,677
That's not what interests you.

853
01:37:38,527 --> 01:37:41,803
Damn. What have I started!

854
01:37:41,967 --> 01:37:44,481
I have listened to you, helped you.

855
01:37:45,927 --> 01:37:50,717
You're crazy, dude.
Damn. Get out of here, Get out.

856
01:39:14,327 --> 01:39:15,919
Listen.

857
01:39:16,367 --> 01:39:19,086
From now on, we separate
the work from the rest.

858
01:39:26,007 --> 01:39:28,601
I never forced you into anything.

859
01:40:18,447 --> 01:40:21,439
