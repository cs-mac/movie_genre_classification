1
00:03:13,618 --> 00:03:15,734
Good luck, General Yin.

2
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:24,177
A man must do or die.

3
00:03:24,378 --> 00:03:26,448
Mr Ho, before I left,

4
00:03:26,658 --> 00:03:28,535
Lord Cheng is concerned about you.

5
00:03:28,738 --> 00:03:30,933
If he can strike back with his army

6
00:03:31,138 --> 00:03:33,811
and defeat the tartars,

7
00:03:34,018 --> 00:03:37,727
credit for Canton will be yours.

8
00:03:38,258 --> 00:03:41,807
One must sacrifice for one's country.

9
00:03:42,858 --> 00:03:44,974
The 6 brothers arrested by tartars

10
00:03:45,178 --> 00:03:48,614
were tortured but have so far

11
00:03:48,818 --> 00:03:50,968
refused to make a confession.

12
00:03:51,178 --> 00:03:52,770
This is most admirable.

13
00:03:54,938 --> 00:03:55,927
If I fail,

14
00:03:56,138 --> 00:03:58,333
I wouldn't even get arrested.

15
00:03:58,538 --> 00:03:59,607
General Yin...

16
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:02,207
Mr Ho, please.

17
00:04:33,818 --> 00:04:35,297
Sirs,

18
00:04:36,058 --> 00:04:40,336
when Inspector-gen. 
and Gen. Tien Ta

19
00:04:40,898 --> 00:04:46,052
arrive, please say a good word for me.

20
00:04:46,778 --> 00:04:49,815
Don't worry, Mr Magistrate,

21
00:04:50,018 --> 00:04:52,896
General Tien Ta ordered us

22
00:04:53,098 --> 00:04:55,293
to capture the 6 traitors.

23
00:04:55,498 --> 00:04:57,489
The Inspector

24
00:04:57,698 --> 00:05:01,134
will supervise the execution.

25
00:05:01,338 --> 00:05:02,168
Yes, yes.

26
00:05:02,498 --> 00:05:06,286
Tang San-yao, it's almost 12.30.

27
00:05:06,498 --> 00:05:08,693
Don't forget the General's command.

28
00:05:08,898 --> 00:05:12,777
The Inspector-general is here.

29
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:13,967
Make way.

30
00:05:14,138 --> 00:05:19,610
Make way.

31
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:11,573
We're trapped!

32
00:06:13,418 --> 00:06:15,329
General Yin, I knew you'd be here

33
00:06:15,538 --> 00:06:18,336
to "Welcome" the Inspector-general,

34
00:06:23,578 --> 00:06:27,491
but he has not yet reached Canton!

35
00:06:46,778 --> 00:06:47,767
Stop.

36
00:06:50,018 --> 00:06:52,407
Your skill is comparable to a general.

37
00:06:52,618 --> 00:06:55,530
Let's have a fair fight:

38
00:06:55,738 --> 00:06:59,048
A General to a General.

39
00:06:59,258 --> 00:07:01,294
Let me try you out.

40
00:07:01,498 --> 00:07:06,208
Good, I need a substitute.

41
00:08:13,178 --> 00:08:14,975
Let me fight you single-handedly.

42
00:08:58,058 --> 00:08:59,855
Quiet down,

43
00:09:00,058 --> 00:09:03,334
the teacher's here

44
00:09:03,538 --> 00:09:08,293
The teacher's here, hurry up...

45
00:09:08,498 --> 00:09:09,647
Mr Ho.

46
00:09:14,018 --> 00:09:17,169
Mr Ho.

47
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:40,293
What's it? 
What's happened to Mr Ho?

48
00:09:42,738 --> 00:09:44,091
Mr Ho.

49
00:09:57,058 --> 00:09:58,537
Please have some tea, Mr Ho.

50
00:10:07,498 --> 00:10:09,534
Mr Ho, why are you so late?

51
00:10:09,738 --> 00:10:11,410
Did you watch the execution?

52
00:10:13,138 --> 00:10:14,127
Leave me alone!

53
00:10:14,338 --> 00:10:16,693
Isn't it enjoyable to watch executions?

54
00:10:17,418 --> 00:10:21,331
Lin Zhen, it depends on who it is.

55
00:10:22,058 --> 00:10:25,414
If it is the tartars who invaded us,

56
00:10:25,618 --> 00:10:27,529
of course it is gratifying.

57
00:10:29,218 --> 00:10:33,609
But today's convicts are patriots.

58
00:10:33,818 --> 00:10:35,809
They are all Han's martyrs.

59
00:10:36,698 --> 00:10:38,529
Do you still think it is enjoyable?

60
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,649
I...

61
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:46,176
Yesterday, I taught you sacrifice

62
00:10:46,378 --> 00:10:50,087
for the sake of a righteous cause.

63
00:10:50,298 --> 00:10:52,732
Do you all understand?

64
00:10:52,938 --> 00:10:54,371
Yes.

65
00:10:56,818 --> 00:10:58,888
Hurry up...

66
00:11:03,018 --> 00:11:04,451
It's here.

67
00:11:20,938 --> 00:11:22,337
Is he dead or alive?

68
00:11:23,418 --> 00:11:26,251
He's so stiff, of course he's dead.

69
00:11:30,818 --> 00:11:32,251
He's a hero.

70
00:11:34,218 --> 00:11:35,253
What did you say?

71
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:36,567
I...

72
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,410
- Arrest him.
- Yes.

73
00:11:39,618 --> 00:11:40,971
You're an accomplice.

74
00:11:41,258 --> 00:11:44,216
Lord Tang... Listen to me.

75
00:11:44,418 --> 00:11:46,693
This student is not a bad man.

76
00:11:46,898 --> 00:11:49,571
He's the son of a seafood shop owner.

77
00:11:51,498 --> 00:11:52,567
Son of a shop owner?

78
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,689
Yes, exactly.

79
00:11:54,898 --> 00:11:58,015
These are his classmates.

80
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,129
Yes, we're his classmates.

81
00:12:00,338 --> 00:12:01,930
Where are you studying?

82
00:12:02,618 --> 00:12:06,327
They all study in Chong Wen College.

83
00:12:06,538 --> 00:12:10,611
Are you vouching for them, Mr Wang?

84
00:12:10,818 --> 00:12:14,697
Yes. Apologise to Lord Tang.

85
00:12:15,378 --> 00:12:16,367
I...

86
00:12:16,538 --> 00:12:19,416
You're young and ignorant.
Always causing trouble.

87
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:27,416
Do you know who I am?

88
00:12:27,618 --> 00:12:31,452
I do. Tang San-yao, Lord Tang.

89
00:12:32,938 --> 00:12:37,011
Yes, let's go, quickly!

90
00:12:39,698 --> 00:12:42,417
- Uncle Wang, we didn't do anything wrong.
- Yes, I know.

91
00:12:42,578 --> 00:12:47,208
Tang San-yao's notorious
for his craze after money and women.

92
00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:51,252
You mustn't antagonise him.

93
00:12:51,698 --> 00:12:53,689
As the saying goes, "One must..."

94
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:57,368
"...humble oneself under enemy's rule."

95
00:13:01,858 --> 00:13:10,493
Mr Ho... please open the door!

96
00:13:13,298 --> 00:13:14,287
Who is it?

97
00:13:14,578 --> 00:13:15,772
Mr Ho.

98
00:13:18,938 --> 00:13:19,927
Open the door, Mr Ho.

99
00:13:20,098 --> 00:13:21,167
Mr Ho.

100
00:13:26,418 --> 00:13:27,851
Mr Ho!

101
00:13:30,338 --> 00:13:32,408
What's wrong?

102
00:13:32,618 --> 00:13:34,176
I...

103
00:13:34,378 --> 00:13:36,494
There's something we don't understand.

104
00:13:36,698 --> 00:13:38,848
So we've come here even at this hour.

105
00:13:39,058 --> 00:13:42,016
Humble oneself under enemy's rule.

106
00:13:42,218 --> 00:13:43,776
Do we and our children have to

107
00:13:43,978 --> 00:13:46,572
humble ourselves forever?

108
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,693
I'd say, we'd be beheaded if we didn't.

109
00:13:53,938 --> 00:13:56,577
If we fear not death we don't have to.

110
00:13:57,298 --> 00:13:59,607
You're right. It's well said.

111
00:14:01,378 --> 00:14:03,938
One brave man alone is not enough,

112
00:14:04,418 --> 00:14:07,535
but unity is strength.

113
00:14:07,738 --> 00:14:10,298
The tartars are well-armed.

114
00:14:10,498 --> 00:14:11,692
We...

115
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:16,416
Man owes allegiance to his country.

116
00:14:17,338 --> 00:14:19,533
Lord Cheng is recruiting in Taiwan.

117
00:14:19,738 --> 00:14:23,777
He's become tartar's biggest concern.

118
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:26,732
The Manchurian emperor has ordered

119
00:14:26,938 --> 00:14:28,929
coastal residents to move away

120
00:14:30,018 --> 00:14:32,691
and to be on their guard.

121
00:14:33,218 --> 00:14:35,891
Mr Ho, I wish Lord Cheng could use us.

122
00:14:36,938 --> 00:14:38,496
The day will come.

123
00:14:39,298 --> 00:14:41,528
Don't you all want to help?

124
00:14:41,738 --> 00:14:42,966
Yes.

125
00:14:43,778 --> 00:14:45,530
Good. Come here.

126
00:14:45,738 --> 00:14:46,727
Yes.

127
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:55,497
Secret documents will arrive by sea.

128
00:14:55,698 --> 00:14:58,576
I need a way to bypass customs.

129
00:14:59,258 --> 00:15:01,852
Liu Yu-de, doesn't your pa
run a seafood shop?

130
00:15:02,018 --> 00:15:03,053
Yes.

131
00:15:15,218 --> 00:15:16,776
Open sesame.

132
00:15:17,098 --> 00:15:19,054
Shut sesame.

133
00:15:23,738 --> 00:15:25,137
Mr Ho sent us here.

134
00:15:25,338 --> 00:15:26,373
Good.

135
00:15:32,538 --> 00:15:35,132
Little brother, you're a brave fellow.

136
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,894
Lock it up...

137
00:15:45,098 --> 00:15:46,736
Yes, hurry...

138
00:15:46,938 --> 00:15:49,498
Pa, has San Li's abalone arrived?

139
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,212
The abalone... Go, go now!

140
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,454
It has... The sea cucumber has too.

141
00:16:07,858 --> 00:16:10,850
Te, what are you doing?

142
00:16:11,618 --> 00:16:13,176
A big order for abalone was placed.

143
00:16:13,378 --> 00:16:15,608
I am showing them some samples.

144
00:16:16,898 --> 00:16:20,368
So you're in business now?

145
00:16:24,258 --> 00:16:28,251
- Te, you can't take the whole case.
- I'm in a hurry to deliver it.

146
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:32,007
Hurry? 
Do you know the market price?

147
00:16:32,218 --> 00:16:35,733
The quality's high. 
Raise the price.

148
00:16:37,938 --> 00:16:39,371
- Open it.
- Yes.

149
00:16:44,858 --> 00:16:46,052
Excellent kung fu.

150
00:16:46,258 --> 00:16:50,251
You'll find that at Shaolin Temple.

151
00:16:53,058 --> 00:16:54,650
Mr Ho, we could invite them to...

152
00:16:54,858 --> 00:16:55,847
Yes.

153
00:16:56,818 --> 00:17:02,370
They don't involve in worldly matters.

154
00:17:02,778 --> 00:17:05,497
If Shaolin taught kung fu to laymen,

155
00:17:05,698 --> 00:17:08,974
people could fight the tartars.

156
00:17:09,178 --> 00:17:10,497
That would be great!

157
00:17:27,538 --> 00:17:34,376
Yue Shan, South gate... here.

158
00:17:37,298 --> 00:17:38,447
General Tien,

159
00:17:39,098 --> 00:17:40,326
Arise.

160
00:17:41,258 --> 00:17:42,486
Come over here.

161
00:17:48,058 --> 00:17:52,813
Lately, we've suppressed rebels

162
00:17:53,018 --> 00:17:55,691
and found this on their leaders.

163
00:17:55,898 --> 00:17:59,493
Zheng Cheng-gong's edict.

164
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:02,257
Look, what have you been doing?

165
00:18:03,178 --> 00:18:06,090
There must be many of Cheng's men

166
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:09,813
hiding in Canton.

167
00:18:11,578 --> 00:18:15,287
We must capture the rebels

168
00:18:16,018 --> 00:18:21,650
and kill them to scare them off.

169
00:18:42,978 --> 00:18:43,967
Who's that?

170
00:18:45,098 --> 00:18:48,727
No idea. He's secretive, maybe a spy.

171
00:18:49,138 --> 00:18:50,776
I'm innocent. 
I'm a delivery boy.

172
00:18:50,978 --> 00:18:52,331
I've brought dried fish. 
Look!

173
00:18:53,418 --> 00:18:54,407
Shut up.

174
00:19:15,138 --> 00:19:19,814
Lord Zheng, notorious rebels...

175
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:26,566
- Who told you to bring this here?
- No... no use to ask me.

176
00:19:31,098 --> 00:19:37,856
Kid, we'll take you away

177
00:19:38,058 --> 00:19:43,894
and torture you one after another.

178
00:19:44,658 --> 00:19:47,047
See how long you will hold your silence.

179
00:19:48,378 --> 00:19:54,977
I'll talk... Don't torture me.

180
00:19:56,738 --> 00:20:06,534
I... I say, there is someone.

181
00:20:14,418 --> 00:20:27,934
Go on with the torture if you like!

182
00:20:43,098 --> 00:20:45,817
I saw a squadron of Ching troops

183
00:20:46,018 --> 00:20:48,896
of over 100 patrolling our alley.

184
00:20:49,218 --> 00:20:50,731
Mr Ho, what shall we do?

185
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:56,097
We must keep calm and be on the alert.

186
00:20:56,858 --> 00:21:01,010
Yien-pin, let them hide in your home.

187
00:21:01,938 --> 00:21:03,291
Mr Ho, what about you...

188
00:21:06,738 --> 00:21:08,330
- Mr Ho, Mr Ho.
- Go quickly, go!

189
00:21:08,498 --> 00:21:10,375
- What about you?
- Hurry up, quick.

190
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:34,737
Master, look!

191
00:21:35,538 --> 00:21:40,054
Please have mercy. 
Please talk to them.

192
00:21:40,218 --> 00:21:43,369
- Please ask them not to...
- Quiet!

193
00:21:44,378 --> 00:21:47,529
General's order: No dried fish.

194
00:21:47,778 --> 00:21:49,336
Then...

195
00:21:49,698 --> 00:21:51,768
What's your relationship with Liu Yu-de?

196
00:21:53,258 --> 00:21:54,452
He... he's my son.

197
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:56,013
Bring him here.

198
00:21:56,298 --> 00:21:59,734
He's not home... What do you want him for?

199
00:22:00,498 --> 00:22:03,296
We've uncovered many spies recently.

200
00:22:03,498 --> 00:22:09,016
One's a teacher, another's his pupil.

201
00:22:10,818 --> 00:22:12,854
Liu Yu-de's a pupil of that school.

202
00:22:13,258 --> 00:22:15,408
We'll capture him and torture him!

203
00:22:16,258 --> 00:22:18,772
Master, our young master won't...

204
00:22:18,978 --> 00:22:20,457
Please have mercy.

205
00:22:21,058 --> 00:22:22,889
How do you know he wouldn't?

206
00:22:23,858 --> 00:22:25,610
Let's talk it over.

207
00:22:30,738 --> 00:22:31,727
Pa...

208
00:22:31,938 --> 00:22:34,054
Yu-de, run quickly... Yu-de.

209
00:22:34,258 --> 00:22:36,647
Young Master, run, run quickly.

210
00:22:37,578 --> 00:22:38,931
Run quickly, Young Master.

211
00:22:39,138 --> 00:22:40,253
You want to rebel?

212
00:22:42,338 --> 00:22:44,772
Yu-de, run quickly, run!

213
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:13,687
He's innocent! My son!

214
00:23:13,898 --> 00:23:15,331
Liu Yu-de, come up quickly.

215
00:23:16,538 --> 00:23:19,530
My son is innocent, my son!

216
00:23:29,498 --> 00:23:31,295
- Change your clothes at once.
- I...

217
00:23:31,498 --> 00:23:33,887
All wearing school uniform will be arrested.

218
00:23:34,058 --> 00:23:35,730
Wonder what's happened to my home?

219
00:23:35,898 --> 00:23:38,856
Try to find a hiding place first.
We can find out later.

220
00:23:39,058 --> 00:23:40,377
Right, let's go now.

221
00:23:47,658 --> 00:23:49,011
What has happened to my home?

222
00:23:49,858 --> 00:23:51,689
Your home...

223
00:23:51,898 --> 00:23:53,092
Tell me.

224
00:23:54,258 --> 00:23:56,089
All the houses in the neighbouring street

225
00:23:56,298 --> 00:23:58,607
to your home have been cordoned off.

226
00:23:58,818 --> 00:24:00,217
What about my father?

227
00:24:21,058 --> 00:24:22,935
Pa...

228
00:24:23,858 --> 00:24:28,613
Don't be sad. 
It's the same for mine.

229
00:24:32,178 --> 00:24:34,487
I wish I had learned kung fu

230
00:24:34,698 --> 00:24:37,576
instead of studying,

231
00:24:37,778 --> 00:24:40,690
so I could fight them.

232
00:24:40,978 --> 00:24:44,414
Studies teach us right from wrong.

233
00:24:45,578 --> 00:24:46,806
What's the use of that?

234
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:49,532
We can't talk sense with the tartars.

235
00:24:56,058 --> 00:24:58,208
We can't stay in this town anymore.

236
00:24:58,658 --> 00:25:01,172
The martial arts headquarters is...

237
00:25:01,378 --> 00:25:02,731
Shaolin Temple.

238
00:25:09,098 --> 00:25:10,577
We're lucky we made it.

239
00:25:12,298 --> 00:25:13,731
Let's go straight on.

240
00:25:22,458 --> 00:25:24,892
Did you see a group of men riding by?

241
00:25:27,258 --> 00:25:29,374
Why don't you answer me?

242
00:25:31,058 --> 00:25:32,047
Let's go!

243
00:25:48,138 --> 00:25:49,856
- Dismount and chase them.
- Yes.

244
00:25:50,858 --> 00:25:52,769
These two must be traitors.

245
00:25:52,978 --> 00:25:55,014
One watch the horses, others chase.

246
00:25:55,218 --> 00:25:56,287
Yes.

247
00:26:05,858 --> 00:26:07,007
Hurry up.

248
00:26:18,498 --> 00:26:19,567
Let's go.

249
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,572
Hurry up.

250
00:26:39,138 --> 00:26:40,810
Liu Yu-de, mount it.

251
00:26:41,138 --> 00:26:42,253
Liu Yu-de?

252
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:46,367
Liu Yu-de, escape now. Go!

253
00:26:47,498 --> 00:26:48,692
Don't let him get away.

254
00:27:03,058 --> 00:27:05,492
Liu Yu-de, good luck!

255
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:04,894
Please give me some water.

256
00:29:28,098 --> 00:29:29,326
Thank you, uncle.

257
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:33,334
How far is it to Shaolin Temple?

258
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:36,496
It's not far, only up the mountain.

259
00:29:36,698 --> 00:29:40,373
But it looks like you wouldn't make it.

260
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:45,368
I can... even if I have to crawl there!

261
00:29:49,778 --> 00:29:56,889
Sit down. I don't think you can.

262
00:29:58,938 --> 00:30:05,173
A few Shaolin monks buy food here everyday.

263
00:30:05,378 --> 00:30:08,131
Their cart is over there.

264
00:30:17,738 --> 00:30:20,491
Hurry up... Do it orderly and quickly.

265
00:30:23,338 --> 00:30:24,817
Get going, go!

266
00:30:26,018 --> 00:30:27,292
Why is it so heavy?

267
00:30:27,978 --> 00:30:29,093
Yes, I don't know why.

268
00:30:29,298 --> 00:30:31,493
Go. You'll be punished if you're late.

269
00:30:31,698 --> 00:30:34,087
Let's go, quick!

270
00:30:36,378 --> 00:30:42,089
Push harder, harder, go!

271
00:30:51,698 --> 00:30:56,772
Hurry up, park the cart there.

272
00:30:57,338 --> 00:30:59,852
Come and lend a hand, everybody.

273
00:31:00,138 --> 00:31:02,606
Why are you standing there? Come here.

274
00:31:02,818 --> 00:31:07,050
Take this to the kitchen. Be quick.

275
00:31:15,578 --> 00:31:20,493
Why are you so slow? Hurry up...

276
00:31:34,898 --> 00:31:36,650
What's the matter?

277
00:31:36,858 --> 00:31:38,257
What's that man doing there?

278
00:31:42,338 --> 00:31:44,056
Stay calm, he can still be saved.

279
00:31:44,258 --> 00:31:46,613
Bring him inside. I'll tell the abbot.

280
00:32:54,418 --> 00:32:57,057
Sir, the abbot would like to see you.

281
00:32:57,338 --> 00:32:58,453
Thank you.

282
00:32:58,658 --> 00:33:03,015
This temple is not a sanctuary.

283
00:33:03,218 --> 00:33:06,335
You're spiteful and emotional,

284
00:33:06,538 --> 00:33:08,369
unfit to stay in the temple.

285
00:33:08,578 --> 00:33:11,968
You're recovering, please leave soon.

286
00:33:17,738 --> 00:33:20,206
I had so much difficulty coming here.

287
00:33:20,418 --> 00:33:21,646
I won't leave.

288
00:33:22,018 --> 00:33:24,054
Don't be rude.

289
00:33:24,258 --> 00:33:30,857
Splendid. We believe in fate,

290
00:33:31,058 --> 00:33:35,017
and we believe fate has brought you here.

291
00:33:35,418 --> 00:33:39,013
Brother, you mustn't make a precedence.

292
00:33:39,858 --> 00:33:43,737
He arrived here in a coma

293
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:47,408
but woke up after 10 days.

294
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:50,133
Perseverance to Buddhism

295
00:33:50,338 --> 00:33:52,727
warrants his admittance.

296
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:57,256
Dharma also came to the east

297
00:33:57,458 --> 00:34:00,814
with such perseverance

298
00:34:01,018 --> 00:34:06,297
and laid the foundation of Shaolin.

299
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:13,088
What are your opinions, brothers?

300
00:34:13,458 --> 00:34:16,291
You're right, brother.

301
00:34:19,578 --> 00:34:20,647
Thank you abbot.

302
00:35:05,098 --> 00:35:06,133
Morning, sir.

303
00:35:10,218 --> 00:35:11,890
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

304
00:35:13,938 --> 00:35:15,815
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

305
00:35:25,778 --> 00:35:28,611
San Ta, San Ta.

306
00:35:29,498 --> 00:35:30,692
Morning, sir.

307
00:35:32,778 --> 00:35:35,133
How long have you been here?

308
00:35:35,978 --> 00:35:37,297
Over a year.

309
00:35:37,778 --> 00:35:40,531
Are you unable to endure destitution?

310
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:44,367
No, not that, but...

311
00:35:45,738 --> 00:35:49,651
Don't hide anything from the Buddha.

312
00:35:49,858 --> 00:35:54,295
Before I came here, I heard

313
00:35:54,498 --> 00:35:56,966
Shaolin's the headquarters of kung fu.

314
00:35:57,178 --> 00:36:00,773
But for the past year, I have only cleaned.

315
00:36:00,978 --> 00:36:03,287
I haven't seen any kung fu.

316
00:36:04,578 --> 00:36:07,012
You can learn kung fu if you want to.

317
00:36:07,218 --> 00:36:09,607
As long as they want to, any monk

318
00:36:09,818 --> 00:36:13,413
can learn from the 35 chambers.

319
00:36:13,618 --> 00:36:17,406
If you don't tell us, who would know?

320
00:36:18,378 --> 00:36:21,768
Why do you want to learn kung fu?

321
00:36:22,338 --> 00:36:24,329
Honestly, sir,

322
00:36:24,858 --> 00:36:28,294
before I came here, I saw the people

323
00:36:28,498 --> 00:36:31,695
oppressed by tyrannical rule.

324
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,093
If they were able to learn kung fu,

325
00:36:34,298 --> 00:36:36,209
they could defend themselves

326
00:36:36,418 --> 00:36:38,534
and combat enemies. Therefore...

327
00:36:40,178 --> 00:36:46,413
Good, good, San Ta.

328
00:36:47,618 --> 00:36:51,293
Buddhists shouldn't bear such thought.

329
00:36:51,498 --> 00:36:54,171
Don't mention it again!

330
00:36:54,858 --> 00:36:56,576
I won't abandon such a desire.

331
00:36:56,778 --> 00:36:59,451
Whatever the outcome, I won't dare complain.

332
00:37:01,498 --> 00:37:02,487
Sir.

333
00:37:02,658 --> 00:37:05,934
Can I still learn kung fu?

334
00:37:06,138 --> 00:37:09,653
There're 35 chambers in Shaolin.
Which chamber do you want to start with?

335
00:37:10,818 --> 00:37:14,049
Which is the most advanced?

336
00:37:14,538 --> 00:37:15,937
The top chamber, of course!

337
00:37:16,138 --> 00:37:18,208
Then I'll start from the top.

338
00:38:10,418 --> 00:38:11,612
Sir.

339
00:38:11,858 --> 00:38:15,214
Behold, the Buddha says:

340
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:19,093
"Emptiness is the Eternal Five."

341
00:38:19,578 --> 00:38:22,615
No sight, sound, smell, taste, sense.

342
00:38:24,978 --> 00:38:27,697
The five flavours dull the taste.

343
00:38:29,138 --> 00:38:32,448
The five tones deafen the ear.

344
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:35,896
The five colours blind the eye.

345
00:38:36,098 --> 00:38:38,134
It can also not be seen,

346
00:38:38,338 --> 00:38:40,374
but it won't pass away.

347
00:38:40,578 --> 00:38:42,853
Being at one is eternal.

348
00:38:43,058 --> 00:38:46,130
But all things will come to you.

349
00:38:46,338 --> 00:38:50,934
Without wisdom... without...

350
00:38:51,138 --> 00:38:52,856
Leave!

351
00:38:54,858 --> 00:38:57,088
No wisdom, no gain.

352
00:38:57,298 --> 00:38:59,766
Gaining is not continuant.

353
00:38:59,978 --> 00:39:02,538
All men will come to me once.

354
00:39:02,738 --> 00:39:05,969
For there lies rest

355
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:08,134
and happiness and peace.

356
00:39:08,338 --> 00:39:11,136
It's invisible and inaudible.

357
00:39:11,338 --> 00:39:13,010
And it's inexhaustible.

358
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:16,733
Can you hear the sound of bells?

359
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:22,217
The heart is calm. We hear nothing.

360
00:39:29,898 --> 00:39:34,608
How often do you recite the sutras?

361
00:39:35,138 --> 00:39:37,811
I... I...

362
00:39:38,698 --> 00:39:39,926
Go away!

363
00:39:40,138 --> 00:39:42,174
Sir, I came to learn martial arts.

364
00:39:42,938 --> 00:39:44,166
Get out!

365
00:39:52,058 --> 00:39:55,175
No one learns martial arts here.

366
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:59,209
This is the most advanced field.

367
00:39:59,418 --> 00:40:00,976
You won't understand it.

368
00:40:02,498 --> 00:40:05,535
I'm willing to start from the bottom.

369
00:40:47,898 --> 00:40:51,573
Cross the pond to enter dining hall.

370
00:40:51,778 --> 00:40:52,654
Yes.

371
00:40:59,418 --> 00:41:01,773
Brother, this is the 35th chamber?

372
00:41:01,978 --> 00:41:04,208
Shut up. You starve if you're late.

373
00:41:30,698 --> 00:41:34,373
A pure body is light, steps stable, stance is firm.

374
00:41:34,578 --> 00:41:38,810
Don't enter the hall if you're dirty.

375
00:43:12,818 --> 00:43:15,048
How dare you enter this dining hall?

376
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:16,937
Sir, I want to...

377
00:43:17,138 --> 00:43:18,173
Have congee?

378
00:43:24,098 --> 00:43:25,053
Come with me.

379
00:43:42,138 --> 00:43:43,696
Stand on the wood.

380
00:43:45,258 --> 00:43:46,373
Jump.

381
00:43:50,618 --> 00:43:51,687
Turn around!

382
00:43:55,938 --> 00:43:57,007
Eat!

383
00:44:24,418 --> 00:44:26,215
Get up, you're hopeless.

384
00:44:26,658 --> 00:44:28,933
Clean all the pottery and cutlery.

385
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:21,610
Wall is low, power of Buddha is high.

386
00:45:23,858 --> 00:45:25,655
He's fallen into it.

387
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:30,333
Don't laugh, he's only a novice.

388
00:45:32,778 --> 00:45:34,655
- Enter the dining hall.
- Yes.

389
00:47:03,618 --> 00:47:07,372
San Ta, you're terrific...

390
00:47:37,178 --> 00:47:40,932
Concentrate. You'll find a way.

391
00:47:41,138 --> 00:47:44,892
Keep practicing day and night. Go!

392
00:48:12,378 --> 00:48:13,572
Stop!

393
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:21,608
Wood drifts, its buoyancy is limited.

394
00:48:21,818 --> 00:48:26,653
The harder you step, faster it sinks.

395
00:48:29,338 --> 00:48:30,453
- San Ta.
- Yes.

396
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:32,728
Throw the plate hard into water.

397
00:48:38,938 --> 00:48:42,089
The plate sinks in water.

398
00:48:42,298 --> 00:48:45,927
Just like the wood you stepped upon.

399
00:48:56,218 --> 00:49:00,769
I keep the plate in motion, balanced.

400
00:49:01,378 --> 00:49:03,528
Power takes you forward.

401
00:49:03,738 --> 00:49:06,377
Firmness balances the body.

402
00:49:06,578 --> 00:49:08,250
Uniformity of mind

403
00:49:08,458 --> 00:49:10,449
focuses power.

404
00:49:10,818 --> 00:49:13,935
You must keep this point in mind.

405
00:49:33,858 --> 00:49:38,295
Power, balance, speed.

406
00:50:37,578 --> 00:50:41,537
Power, balance, speed. Right.

407
00:50:43,298 --> 00:50:44,367
Sir, I...

408
00:50:44,578 --> 00:50:45,897
Go!

409
00:50:48,298 --> 00:50:50,528
I beg you to teach me, master.

410
00:50:53,818 --> 00:50:57,128
The 34th chamber focuses
on training arms' strength.

411
00:50:57,698 --> 00:51:03,614
Fist, palm, knife, sword, pole, spear.

412
00:51:03,818 --> 00:51:06,855
All depends on the arm's strength. Look...

413
00:51:12,298 --> 00:51:14,209
This is the basic process.

414
00:51:14,418 --> 00:51:17,410
Carry the water up the slope.

415
00:51:17,618 --> 00:51:22,851
Pour it down to keep it flowing.

416
00:51:23,058 --> 00:51:29,691
Remember, arms must be straight.

417
00:51:31,058 --> 00:51:33,777
You should carry water everyday

418
00:51:33,978 --> 00:51:36,287
to build up arm strength. Go now.

419
00:51:36,498 --> 00:51:37,487
Yes.

420
00:53:27,778 --> 00:53:32,374
I didn't think you'd make it so soon.

421
00:53:37,178 --> 00:53:42,298
Don't help others when they practise,

422
00:53:42,498 --> 00:53:44,966
it'll only ruin them.

423
00:53:45,178 --> 00:53:46,247
Yes.

424
00:53:47,618 --> 00:53:50,735
You've violated our rule. Leave...

425
00:53:51,658 --> 00:53:52,454
Sir.

426
00:53:52,618 --> 00:53:56,088
Go to the 33rd Chamber.

427
00:53:58,978 --> 00:54:00,297
Thank you, sir.

428
00:54:02,058 --> 00:54:04,413
This chamber is comparatively easier.

429
00:54:04,618 --> 00:54:07,451
Whenever you hear me knock the wood,

430
00:54:07,658 --> 00:54:11,253
strike the gong.

431
00:54:16,858 --> 00:54:20,487
Sir, I'm here to learn kung fu, not...

432
00:54:21,178 --> 00:54:24,568
Don't belittle the bamboo poles. Ji Wei.

433
00:54:24,778 --> 00:54:25,574
Yes.

434
00:54:33,418 --> 00:54:35,534
The hammer weighs 10 catties.

435
00:54:35,738 --> 00:54:37,968
It is fitted into a 12-ft pole.

436
00:54:38,178 --> 00:54:40,976
With a foot-long pole,
hammer weighs 10 catties.

437
00:54:41,178 --> 00:54:45,137
With the pole extended,
it now weighs 120 catties.

438
00:54:46,338 --> 00:54:48,932
How much can your wrists bear?

439
00:54:50,618 --> 00:54:52,131
I'm willing to try.

440
00:55:08,698 --> 00:55:12,054
Add on 2 more feet.

441
00:55:22,138 --> 00:55:23,332
Ready...

442
00:56:08,218 --> 00:56:09,412
Keep practising.

443
00:58:36,378 --> 00:58:37,572
My respects to the abbot.

444
00:58:39,378 --> 00:58:42,734
You've left the Wrist Room?

445
00:58:42,938 --> 00:58:47,534
Yes, the overseer said I could leave.

446
00:58:47,898 --> 00:58:53,018
Good. Starting today,

447
00:58:53,218 --> 00:58:56,290
as a reward for your diligence,

448
00:58:56,498 --> 00:58:58,853
you'll be in charge of Sutra Room.

449
00:58:59,058 --> 00:59:00,457
Thank you, abbot.

450
00:59:14,298 --> 00:59:19,452
Brother, San Ta is ambitious.

451
00:59:19,658 --> 00:59:21,296
He's not like our Buddhist brothers.

452
00:59:22,098 --> 00:59:28,173
It's peaceful here in this temple,

453
00:59:28,378 --> 00:59:31,768
but outside it's turbulent.

454
00:59:32,458 --> 00:59:36,007
We may need someone like him.

455
00:59:46,578 --> 00:59:48,967
Please guide me, sir.

456
00:59:54,218 --> 00:59:58,814
Stand between the two burning incense.

457
00:59:59,018 --> 00:59:59,973
Yes.

458
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,167
Anyone practicing martial arts

459
01:00:14,378 --> 01:00:20,897
must be sharp-eyed. Watch the flame.

460
01:00:33,458 --> 01:00:36,575
When the flame oscillates,

461
01:00:36,778 --> 01:00:39,611
your eyes should follow.

462
01:00:39,818 --> 01:00:43,254
But remember,

463
01:00:43,458 --> 01:00:52,127
your head must not move. Start.

464
01:01:57,858 --> 01:02:03,376
Told you not to move your head. Again.

465
01:02:27,058 --> 01:02:31,176
Right, the target has disappeared.

466
01:02:31,378 --> 01:02:34,370
But still, the eyes shouldn't move.

467
01:02:38,098 --> 01:02:44,367
Eyes be bright, limbs be agile.

468
01:02:44,578 --> 01:02:48,287
This is the way to do it.

469
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:49,567
Yes.

470
01:02:54,018 --> 01:02:55,770
Turn around.

471
01:03:18,698 --> 01:03:23,294
San Ta, hit the reflecting poles.

472
01:04:14,258 --> 01:04:19,651
You're my most outstanding pupil.

473
01:04:21,258 --> 01:04:22,611
Thank you, sir.

474
01:04:23,418 --> 01:04:25,329
Head Chamber

475
01:04:57,738 --> 01:04:58,807
Continue.

476
01:05:11,378 --> 01:05:13,573
Don't lower your head. Stand up.

477
01:05:15,218 --> 01:05:16,537
Hands on your waist.

478
01:05:16,698 --> 01:05:19,849
Use your head to hit the sand bags,
then burn incense before the Buddha.

479
01:05:20,018 --> 01:05:20,928
Yes.

480
01:05:38,938 --> 01:05:39,973
Again.

481
01:05:51,138 --> 01:05:52,253
Get up.

482
01:05:52,818 --> 01:05:54,695
Sir, I...

483
01:05:56,058 --> 01:05:58,526
Collapse so soon? Get up now.

484
01:05:58,978 --> 01:06:00,809
Continue. Go on.

485
01:06:34,378 --> 01:06:35,447
Sir.

486
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:38,968
San Ta. Were it not for 2 years' hard work,

487
01:06:39,178 --> 01:06:43,171
you might not even take one step into this alley.

488
01:06:44,618 --> 01:06:48,657
San Ta, head is the most important

489
01:06:48,858 --> 01:06:51,292
and the last phase in the training.

490
01:06:51,498 --> 01:06:53,090
After going through it,

491
01:06:53,298 --> 01:06:56,335
you can learn fighting and weapons.

492
01:07:02,338 --> 01:07:03,487
Offer the incense.

493
01:07:11,498 --> 01:07:19,212
Use your strength to hit it. Get up!

494
01:07:21,738 --> 01:07:25,651
Come on, get up!

495
01:07:52,218 --> 01:07:55,574
You've set a new record.

496
01:07:55,778 --> 01:08:00,898
You've completed the basic skills

497
01:08:01,098 --> 01:08:04,249
of the 10 chambers in 25 months' time.

498
01:08:04,538 --> 01:08:06,733
I can't do it without the teachers.

499
01:08:08,178 --> 01:08:12,854
You can now practise boxing,

500
01:08:13,058 --> 01:08:16,607
knife, baton and other skills.

501
01:08:16,818 --> 01:08:17,853
Yes.

502
01:08:18,858 --> 01:08:20,689
Justice Officer.

503
01:08:21,578 --> 01:08:25,014
I'll make him head of Dharma House.

504
01:08:29,778 --> 01:08:32,338
San Ta, greet these two abbots.

505
01:08:32,538 --> 01:08:33,414
Yes.

506
01:09:07,618 --> 01:09:08,573
Stop!

507
01:09:24,298 --> 01:09:25,287
Continue!

508
01:10:23,538 --> 01:10:24,857
San Ta!

509
01:10:32,938 --> 01:10:35,008
Leg Chamber

510
01:10:49,978 --> 01:10:51,172
Sir.

511
01:10:51,698 --> 01:10:54,656
San Ta, not bad, not bad.

512
01:11:00,138 --> 01:11:01,127
Sword Chamber

513
01:12:53,698 --> 01:12:54,892
Turn around faster.

514
01:14:10,018 --> 01:14:11,246
Good fellow.

515
01:14:28,258 --> 01:14:29,247
San Ta.

516
01:14:43,098 --> 01:14:47,455
San Ta, it's commendable of you

517
01:14:47,658 --> 01:14:51,537
to master all 35 chambers' kung fu

518
01:14:51,738 --> 01:14:54,093
in only 5 years.

519
01:14:54,778 --> 01:14:58,737
Now I'll make you deputy overseer of

520
01:14:58,938 --> 01:15:01,975
any of the 35 chambers.

521
01:15:03,658 --> 01:15:07,617
Brother, San Ta's post is high enough.

522
01:15:07,818 --> 01:15:09,695
He's been promoted 8 times in 5 years.

523
01:15:10,538 --> 01:15:12,688
With his present skill,

524
01:15:12,898 --> 01:15:16,129
he's qualified to be deputy overseer.

525
01:15:16,338 --> 01:15:20,217
Shaolin arts has existed for 1000 yrs.

526
01:15:20,418 --> 01:15:23,171
We mustn't make a hasty decision.

527
01:15:23,618 --> 01:15:25,688
In my opinion.

528
01:15:25,898 --> 01:15:29,811
Let him fight me with any weapon.

529
01:15:30,018 --> 01:15:34,250
If he wins, he can be an overseer.

530
01:15:34,818 --> 01:15:36,570
You heard what he said.

531
01:15:36,778 --> 01:15:41,454
You heard what he said.

532
01:15:41,658 --> 01:15:44,047
What do you think?

533
01:15:44,578 --> 01:15:45,977
I dare not.

534
01:15:47,658 --> 01:15:51,367
It's my idea. If you win

535
01:15:51,578 --> 01:15:55,287
you can take charge of any chamber.

536
01:15:56,498 --> 01:15:58,932
Excuse me then, sir.

537
01:16:25,338 --> 01:16:26,248
Watch out.

538
01:17:04,418 --> 01:17:06,886
Thank you, sir. I've lost.

539
01:17:10,818 --> 01:17:12,888
You may challenge me any time.

540
01:18:59,378 --> 01:19:02,176
How many times have I tapped you?

541
01:19:02,378 --> 01:19:03,288
17 times.

542
01:19:03,618 --> 01:19:07,213
I could've hurt you with the blade.

543
01:19:12,298 --> 01:19:14,289
You're right.

544
01:19:16,698 --> 01:19:18,131
I'll continue with my practise.

545
01:19:23,418 --> 01:19:27,297
Brother, I think he'll never win.

546
01:19:28,778 --> 01:19:29,927
Not necessarily.

547
01:20:57,658 --> 01:20:59,296
What weapon is San Ta using?

548
01:21:00,738 --> 01:21:03,650
A three-jointed stick invented by himself.

549
01:21:38,778 --> 01:21:41,133
Good, that blow was not bad.

550
01:21:43,458 --> 01:21:44,254
Go on!

551
01:21:49,618 --> 01:21:51,256
Sir, are you alright?

552
01:21:52,258 --> 01:21:54,453
San Ta, I still have my weapons.

553
01:22:25,738 --> 01:22:26,693
Excuse me.

554
01:22:29,018 --> 01:22:30,212
Abbot,

555
01:22:30,418 --> 01:22:32,932
San Ta can take charge of any chamber.

556
01:22:33,418 --> 01:22:37,377
San Ta, you can choose to take charge of

557
01:22:37,578 --> 01:22:42,208
any of the 35 chambers except

558
01:22:42,418 --> 01:22:46,047
the Top Chamber. Your Buddhism

559
01:22:46,258 --> 01:22:48,374
attainment is not advanced enough.

560
01:22:48,578 --> 01:22:49,806
Abbot,

561
01:22:50,018 --> 01:22:52,248
I've not yet made up my mind.

562
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:55,971
Never mind. I'll give you 3 days.

563
01:22:56,178 --> 01:22:57,167
Thank you, abbot.

564
01:23:00,058 --> 01:23:02,128
There're only 35 chambers in Shaolin,

565
01:23:02,338 --> 01:23:04,215
there isn't a 36th chamber.

566
01:23:04,418 --> 01:23:09,208
I know. I'd like to create it.

567
01:23:09,898 --> 01:23:11,172
This 36th chamber is...

568
01:23:11,378 --> 01:23:13,733
It's a pity Shaolin martial arts

569
01:23:13,938 --> 01:23:17,453
is confined solely to the temple.

570
01:23:17,658 --> 01:23:21,731
It should be taught widely to all.

571
01:23:21,938 --> 01:23:24,896
That's my idea for the new chamber:

572
01:23:25,098 --> 01:23:28,932
to teach martial arts to laymen.

573
01:23:33,058 --> 01:23:36,812
We don't involve in worldly affairs.

574
01:23:37,018 --> 01:23:40,567
Nor do we admit secular pupils.

575
01:23:40,778 --> 01:23:42,097
Forget it.

576
01:23:42,258 --> 01:23:45,455
Abbot, this affects the handing down
of Shaolin martial arts to posterity.

577
01:23:45,618 --> 01:23:48,132
Please let me enrol promising youths

578
01:23:48,338 --> 01:23:49,976
and train them in the 36th chamber.

579
01:23:50,178 --> 01:23:52,373
Nonsense, how dare you talk back?

580
01:23:59,178 --> 01:24:00,293
I don't mean to...

581
01:24:00,498 --> 01:24:03,376
Shut up!
I must ask you to reconsider, abbot.

582
01:24:03,818 --> 01:24:04,807
Justice Officer.

583
01:24:05,018 --> 01:24:05,973
Yes.

584
01:24:06,698 --> 01:24:13,012
Our pupil San Ta should be punished.

585
01:24:13,218 --> 01:24:14,128
Yes.

586
01:24:18,338 --> 01:24:22,092
San Ta, you've violated our rule.

587
01:24:22,298 --> 01:24:24,175
You have to collect contributions.

588
01:24:24,378 --> 01:24:27,609
Don't return unless the book is full.

589
01:24:28,138 --> 01:24:32,211
Yes. Abbot, I deserve punishment.

590
01:24:34,178 --> 01:24:37,011
Leave tomorrow morning.

591
01:25:20,778 --> 01:25:25,329
You want to pray for Chiang Tai?

592
01:25:25,538 --> 01:25:27,688
They all died.

593
01:25:27,898 --> 01:25:29,934
They were buried in East cemetery.

594
01:25:30,538 --> 01:25:33,257
Go there and pray for them.

595
01:25:43,538 --> 01:25:46,689
Uncle Wei, may you rest in peace. We will

596
01:25:46,898 --> 01:25:51,210
complete your mission
and restore the Ming rule.

597
01:25:51,378 --> 01:25:52,174
Hung Hsi-kuan.

598
01:25:52,338 --> 01:25:54,772
Hung Hsi-kuan, I knew you'd be here
to bury your accomplices.

599
01:25:55,178 --> 01:25:55,974
Run!

600
01:25:56,218 --> 01:25:57,492
Go!

601
01:26:00,058 --> 01:26:01,411
See if you can escape.

602
01:26:01,858 --> 01:26:07,012
Good! I'll kill you one after another.

603
01:26:08,738 --> 01:26:11,127
Go ahead and try.

604
01:26:55,298 --> 01:26:57,528
Tang San-yao, you're so malicious.

605
01:26:57,738 --> 01:27:00,093
Your vice will be punished.

606
01:27:00,378 --> 01:27:02,209
Scram, bloody monk.

607
01:27:02,538 --> 01:27:03,937
Master, please stay out of this.

608
01:27:04,818 --> 01:27:05,887
So you're an accomplice.

609
01:27:12,818 --> 01:27:15,730
Tang San-yao, remember 7 years ago,

610
01:27:15,938 --> 01:27:18,498
you confiscated my school and my shop

611
01:27:18,698 --> 01:27:19,847
and kill my whole family?

612
01:27:23,338 --> 01:27:26,296
You're Liu Yu-de, a fugitive! Get him.

613
01:27:31,258 --> 01:27:32,896
- Go help your brothers.
- OK!

614
01:29:08,098 --> 01:29:11,534
You're a Buddhist, show mercy.

615
01:29:11,898 --> 01:29:14,366
Even Buddha has to conquer evil.

616
01:29:14,898 --> 01:29:16,650
A monk should not kill.

617
01:29:17,618 --> 01:29:19,176
A monk cannot but I can. I'll do it!

618
01:29:25,298 --> 01:29:28,927
Tang San-yao, you've killed my men.

619
01:29:29,138 --> 01:29:30,776
I'll stab you 1,000 times!

620
01:29:35,858 --> 01:29:37,928
Amitabha Buddha.

621
01:29:47,538 --> 01:29:50,769
Thank God. Today, our martyrs

622
01:29:50,978 --> 01:29:53,333
can see you lying dead here.

623
01:29:56,458 --> 01:30:00,451
Master, I want to learn martial arts.

624
01:30:00,658 --> 01:30:01,977
Please accept me as your pupil.

625
01:30:05,818 --> 01:30:09,811
Good. I've come from Shaolin

626
01:30:10,018 --> 01:30:12,452
to enrol promising youths.

627
01:30:13,098 --> 01:30:15,692
Hsi-kuan, is Tien Ta still in Canton?

628
01:30:15,898 --> 01:30:17,092
Yes.

629
01:30:18,658 --> 01:30:22,936
His hand is stained with Han's blood.

630
01:30:23,618 --> 01:30:28,487
We must eliminate him at all costs.

631
01:30:30,538 --> 01:30:32,813
We'll plan well.

632
01:30:33,018 --> 01:30:34,576
Find a hideout first.

633
01:30:34,778 --> 01:30:36,177
Don't act rashly.

634
01:30:36,938 --> 01:30:39,896
Do you know of other hot-blooded youths?

635
01:30:40,098 --> 01:30:44,330
Yes, Tung Qian-jin is another.

636
01:30:45,018 --> 01:30:48,806
Tung Qian-jin, Commander's orders.

637
01:30:49,018 --> 01:30:51,612
Make a batch of wheels.

638
01:30:58,938 --> 01:31:00,337
Deliver them within one month.

639
01:31:00,818 --> 01:31:02,251
I can't, it'll take one year.

640
01:31:02,618 --> 01:31:04,893
One year? Are you turning me down?

641
01:31:08,738 --> 01:31:11,935
Do you want to join the dead?

642
01:31:12,818 --> 01:31:16,447
Want my help?

643
01:31:18,738 --> 01:31:20,456
I'll teach you to be smarter.

644
01:31:27,178 --> 01:31:28,327
Beat him up!

645
01:31:40,138 --> 01:31:42,333
Are you going to do it or not?

646
01:31:42,818 --> 01:31:43,773
Not over my dead body.

647
01:32:45,978 --> 01:32:47,934
It is better to use the haft.

648
01:33:18,138 --> 01:33:22,177
Help!

649
01:33:22,378 --> 01:33:23,936
Do you still want the wheels made?

650
01:33:24,138 --> 01:33:25,617
No, no!

651
01:33:26,298 --> 01:33:27,253
Damn you!

652
01:33:27,578 --> 01:33:30,046
Good! Good!

653
01:33:34,258 --> 01:33:36,692
Master, Master!

654
01:33:45,898 --> 01:33:51,256
Master... Let me follow you.

655
01:33:52,658 --> 01:33:53,568
Why?

656
01:33:53,818 --> 01:33:56,207
I admire you. Please accept me as your disciple.

657
01:33:56,498 --> 01:33:57,851
Please take me as your pupil.

658
01:33:59,378 --> 01:34:01,255
Tung Qian-jin, what's wrong with you?

659
01:34:01,458 --> 01:34:03,608
You said you won't submit to anyone

660
01:34:03,818 --> 01:34:07,128
and will challenge even the Gods?

661
01:34:08,298 --> 01:34:10,812
Why are you kowtowing to a monk now?

662
01:34:11,818 --> 01:34:14,810
What do you know? He's not a monk.

663
01:34:15,658 --> 01:34:17,057
He's a Bodhisattva.

664
01:34:17,338 --> 01:34:18,851
He only said several words.

665
01:34:19,058 --> 01:34:22,255
And I scared the tartars away.

666
01:34:22,578 --> 01:34:27,015
So he's a living Bodhisattva?

667
01:34:27,418 --> 01:34:32,446
I'm only a monk from Shaolin Temple.

668
01:34:33,258 --> 01:34:36,807
I taught you to avoid direct conflict.

669
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:39,932
They've learnt kung fu, you haven't.

670
01:34:40,138 --> 01:34:43,813
Using a heavy weapon slows you down

671
01:34:44,018 --> 01:34:46,612
and puts you at a disadvantage.

672
01:34:46,938 --> 01:34:47,973
Right.

673
01:34:48,898 --> 01:34:53,574
Lu Ah-cai, are you convinced now?

674
01:34:55,338 --> 01:34:57,010
Master, it makes sense.

675
01:35:08,178 --> 01:35:10,169
Lu Ah-cai, can you move?

676
01:35:18,298 --> 01:35:20,653
Lu Ah-cai, don't make hasty moves.

677
01:35:20,858 --> 01:35:23,975
Master, I'm convinced.

678
01:35:30,618 --> 01:35:32,734
Master, I'm convinced.

679
01:35:33,658 --> 01:35:34,693
Are you sure now?

680
01:35:34,978 --> 01:35:37,173
I am, I'm convinced.

681
01:35:38,098 --> 01:35:40,976
Master, please come in for some tea.

682
01:36:12,018 --> 01:36:14,293
Master, I'm really convinced.

683
01:36:22,858 --> 01:36:24,337
How did Tang San-yao die?

684
01:36:26,298 --> 01:36:28,414
You still haven't found out yet?

685
01:36:28,618 --> 01:36:29,892
He was chopped by a knife.

686
01:36:30,538 --> 01:36:35,134
I only want the man who chopped him.

687
01:36:35,338 --> 01:36:36,896
Yes, we're investigating.

688
01:36:38,698 --> 01:36:42,452
Kill all suspects.

689
01:36:42,658 --> 01:36:43,534
Yes.

690
01:36:48,698 --> 01:36:53,818
You must be on the alert.

691
01:36:55,058 --> 01:36:56,047
Yes.

692
01:36:57,378 --> 01:36:59,812
This is General Tien Ta's residence.

693
01:37:00,218 --> 01:37:03,210
He patrols the city every day,

694
01:37:03,498 --> 01:37:05,489
and he must pass through this street

695
01:37:05,818 --> 01:37:08,810
when he goes to the city gates.

696
01:37:09,738 --> 01:37:13,890
Shops on both sides of the street

697
01:37:15,098 --> 01:37:18,408
made it difficult for us to get him.

698
01:37:23,818 --> 01:37:26,491
Any households on this street?

699
01:37:26,698 --> 01:37:27,574
Yes.

700
01:37:29,578 --> 01:37:31,296
There is a rice-miller's shop.

701
01:37:31,578 --> 01:37:33,967
Back to back with the General's residence.

702
01:37:34,138 --> 01:37:36,333
- Are there many people living there?
- There seems to be only one person.

703
01:38:01,218 --> 01:38:02,367
Sir...

704
01:38:02,738 --> 01:38:04,456
Amitabha Buddha.

705
01:38:08,618 --> 01:38:09,653
Sir, I...

706
01:38:09,858 --> 01:38:14,215
No one would come for offerings this late.

707
01:38:24,058 --> 01:38:27,733
What are you doing? Go away.

708
01:38:32,498 --> 01:38:33,726
What do you mean by that?

709
01:38:34,538 --> 01:38:35,812
Sir, please excuse me.

710
01:38:36,018 --> 01:38:37,610
What do you want?

711
01:38:38,658 --> 01:38:40,808
May I know your name, sir?

712
01:38:43,818 --> 01:38:45,046
My father died

713
01:38:45,258 --> 01:38:47,089
without telling me my name.

714
01:38:47,298 --> 01:38:49,528
So I have no name.

715
01:38:49,738 --> 01:38:51,968
I started milling rice when I was six,

716
01:38:52,178 --> 01:38:55,454
so they call me Miller Six.

717
01:38:56,018 --> 01:38:58,578
I'm San Ta. I'm from Shaolin Temple.

718
01:39:00,418 --> 01:39:03,967
People say that monks from Shaolin

719
01:39:04,178 --> 01:39:07,250
are excellent at kung fu. No wonder...

720
01:39:07,458 --> 01:39:08,732
I've practised for several years.

721
01:39:11,218 --> 01:39:15,734
Having milled rice for many years...

722
01:39:19,338 --> 01:39:24,128
I also have a pair of strong feet.

723
01:39:24,418 --> 01:39:25,931
Do you want to try them?

724
01:39:35,938 --> 01:39:38,498
I've drunk a bit too much today.

725
01:39:38,778 --> 01:39:41,531
But your footwork's not bad.

726
01:39:42,538 --> 01:39:44,813
Let's go in for a drink. Let's go!

727
01:39:45,338 --> 01:39:47,852
You can't stay here much longer.

728
01:39:48,058 --> 01:39:49,127
Why not?

729
01:39:49,698 --> 01:39:53,850
Very soon, something big will happen

730
01:39:54,058 --> 01:39:56,618
in the General's residence.

731
01:40:02,618 --> 01:40:04,051
What is it?

732
01:40:04,698 --> 01:40:08,407
General Tien Ta's going to die here.

733
01:40:09,338 --> 01:40:11,647
How can you say something like that?

734
01:40:11,858 --> 01:40:13,610
Aren't you afraid of being executed?

735
01:40:14,618 --> 01:40:16,495
I beg you to leave here at once, please!

736
01:40:16,698 --> 01:40:18,450
I don't care whether you came from,

737
01:40:18,658 --> 01:40:21,695
Shaolin or Linshao Temple,
please just leave. I beg you.

738
01:40:22,458 --> 01:40:25,291
The Ching tartars killed so many people.

739
01:40:25,498 --> 01:40:27,090
Don't you want to fight back?

740
01:40:28,858 --> 01:40:32,487
I'm only a rice miller. Even if I did,

741
01:40:32,698 --> 01:40:35,292
what good will it do? I'd rather drink.

742
01:40:36,778 --> 01:40:39,451
People continue to suffer because

743
01:40:39,658 --> 01:40:42,809
too many people have that attitude.

744
01:40:43,938 --> 01:40:45,337
You'd put it more plainly.

745
01:40:45,778 --> 01:40:48,497
I want to borrow your place.

746
01:40:48,698 --> 01:40:52,407
No... lf you do,
I won't be able to stay here anymore.

747
01:40:52,578 --> 01:40:55,331
Don't worry. I'll take you to Shaolin.

748
01:41:08,818 --> 01:41:16,816
Go away...! 
Come here, on your knees...

749
01:41:24,018 --> 01:41:25,246
Lord Cheng, we caught them

750
01:41:25,458 --> 01:41:27,255
near the cemetery.

751
01:41:28,738 --> 01:41:29,568
Kill them all!

752
01:41:29,778 --> 01:41:30,847
Yes.

753
01:41:31,218 --> 01:41:32,253
Stop!

754
01:41:35,218 --> 01:41:38,096
Lord Cheng, I killed Tang San-yao.

755
01:41:38,298 --> 01:41:41,927
Not them!

756
01:41:42,898 --> 01:41:46,527
You?

757
01:41:46,738 --> 01:41:49,298
How did you kill him?

758
01:41:56,338 --> 01:41:57,248
With this.

759
01:41:57,458 --> 01:41:59,096
- Take him.
- Yes.

760
01:42:13,138 --> 01:42:14,127
Where did you learn it?

761
01:42:15,938 --> 01:42:17,166
In Shaolin Temple.

762
01:43:59,338 --> 01:44:00,407
Report to the General! Quick!

763
01:44:00,578 --> 01:44:02,011
Yes.

764
01:44:55,738 --> 01:44:58,298
Master, we're outnumbered.

765
01:44:58,778 --> 01:45:03,294
Yes, there're so many of them.
Everyday they wake me up early.

766
01:45:07,458 --> 01:45:09,528
Will you please calm down?

767
01:45:10,178 --> 01:45:12,214
No, I can't. 
I'm Miller Six.

768
01:45:17,258 --> 01:45:18,452
This is flour.

769
01:45:21,338 --> 01:45:24,694
Commanders Tang and Cheng are famous.

770
01:45:24,898 --> 01:45:27,856
Their failure this time is because...

771
01:45:30,018 --> 01:45:34,057
If more monks were here

772
01:45:34,258 --> 01:45:35,930
there might be a rebellion in Canton!

773
01:45:36,138 --> 01:45:37,173
Yes...

774
01:45:39,818 --> 01:45:44,096
Tomorrow I'll bring some men to capture him,

775
01:45:44,898 --> 01:45:48,254
even if I have to go to Shaolin.

776
01:46:01,258 --> 01:46:05,410
Go, go at once... Run!

777
01:46:59,418 --> 01:47:00,294
Give me a sword.

778
01:47:19,298 --> 01:47:23,086
You, a monk, joining the rebels!

779
01:47:27,618 --> 01:47:29,654
A Buddhist has to conquer evil.

780
01:47:29,858 --> 01:47:32,326
How many lives have you taken?

781
01:47:33,018 --> 01:47:37,933
I've killed many, but never a monk.

782
01:50:35,698 --> 01:50:36,653
Stop!

783
01:51:05,978 --> 01:51:07,491
The sweeping tail of the dancing dragon.
