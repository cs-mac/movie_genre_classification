1
00:00:14,726 --> 00:00:18,662
One last thought before
the bright halls of high school

2
00:00:18,662 --> 00:00:20,493
fade into memory--

3
00:00:20,493 --> 00:00:24,001
Good luck, good life.

4
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:27,004
I wish you all
the health, prosperity...

5
00:00:27,004 --> 00:00:29,009
We want money!

6
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:30,940
and happiness you desire.

7
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,945
Congratulations,
class of'87.

8
00:00:46,694 --> 00:00:48,457
Here, that's yours.

9
00:00:48,457 --> 00:00:50,963
See you later.

10
00:00:50,963 --> 00:00:54,296
Thank you.
This is too great.

11
00:00:54,296 --> 00:00:57,303
Consider it
a graduation gift.

12
00:00:57,303 --> 00:00:59,896
The fact is,
I never thought

13
00:00:59,896 --> 00:01:02,909
we'd get this far.

14
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:05,912
Um, I'm speechless.

15
00:01:05,912 --> 00:01:07,914
That's another surprise!

16
00:01:07,914 --> 00:01:10,917
All right,
I'll be home much later.

17
00:01:10,917 --> 00:01:11,667
OK.

18
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,412
Thanks, man.

19
00:01:14,412 --> 00:01:17,924
Keep on your toes.
Nobody likes a complacent parent.

20
00:01:19,627 --> 00:01:21,925
Hi, Miss Simpson,
how are you?

21
00:01:21,925 --> 00:01:23,930
You have plans
for tonight?

22
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,932
After dinner,
a few parties.

23
00:01:25,932 --> 00:01:27,934
How's your father,
Blair?

24
00:01:27,934 --> 00:01:31,438
He was supposed to be here,
but I guess his plane was delayed.

25
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:32,938
Graduates.

26
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:34,440
Mom Easton,

27
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,442
you must be very proud.

28
00:01:36,442 --> 00:01:37,943
Extremely.

29
00:01:37,943 --> 00:01:39,946
Where's
the ex-Mr. Easton?

30
00:01:39,946 --> 00:01:41,948
He's bringing the car around.

31
00:01:41,948 --> 00:01:42,948
Ready?

32
00:01:42,948 --> 00:01:44,951
I'll see you at dinner?

33
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:46,953
Yeah. Dad coming?

34
00:01:46,953 --> 00:01:49,956
Yes, but don't worry.
Amnesty for a special occasion.

35
00:01:49,956 --> 00:01:51,958
All right, bye.

36
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:57,292
Hey, congratulations!

37
00:02:00,734 --> 00:02:02,326
Catch this!

38
00:02:03,404 --> 00:02:04,666
Good catch!

39
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,672
Wait a minute!
Hold up!

40
00:02:06,672 --> 00:02:08,674
I have a brief announcement.

41
00:02:08,674 --> 00:02:12,178
I want you to know
that I, Julian Wells,

42
00:02:12,178 --> 00:02:15,079
have just become
a fully-financed record producer.

43
00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:17,583
Where did you
get the dough?

44
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:20,085
Mr. Benjamin Wells,
the greatest dad in dad history.

45
00:02:20,085 --> 00:02:22,679
Tone Deaf Records
is a reality.

46
00:02:22,679 --> 00:02:25,691
If you quit college,
we could work together.

47
00:02:25,691 --> 00:02:26,691
No.

48
00:02:26,691 --> 00:02:28,694
Why don't you
try college?

49
00:02:28,694 --> 00:02:30,696
I barely survived
high school.

50
00:02:30,696 --> 00:02:33,699
I can't believe
we won't be together.

51
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:35,701
We have the summer together.

52
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:38,033
Markie, a photo
for posterity.

53
00:02:39,773 --> 00:02:40,705
Ready?

54
00:02:40,705 --> 00:02:41,900
Yes.

55
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,000
Ha ha ha!
Ready?

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,272
Aim...

57
00:03:24,118 --> 00:03:25,244
Hello.

58
00:03:25,244 --> 00:03:28,254
Hi, it's me. It's early, huh?
It's late for me.

59
00:03:28,254 --> 00:03:30,256
Are you coming home
for Christmas?

60
00:03:30,256 --> 00:03:31,256
Yeah.

61
00:03:31,256 --> 00:03:32,257
Great.

62
00:03:33,827 --> 00:03:35,761
Why are you calling?

63
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:37,922
I'm sorry.
This is stupid.

64
00:03:37,922 --> 00:03:40,432
I just want to
see you.

65
00:03:40,432 --> 00:03:42,935
Call me when you
get back.

66
00:03:42,935 --> 00:03:45,267
I need to
see you, Clay.

67
00:04:08,662 --> 00:04:11,722
<i>What's the matter,
Blair?</i>

68
00:04:11,722 --> 00:04:13,232
<i>Nothing.</i>

69
00:04:13,232 --> 00:04:14,494
<i>Blair.</i>

70
00:04:18,172 --> 00:04:21,232
<i>I'm not going to college.
I'm staying here.</i>

71
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,572
<i>Why?</i>

72
00:04:26,313 --> 00:04:28,247
<i>I can't leave now.</i>

73
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:31,250
<i>I'm starting to get
all the great jobs.</i>

74
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,253
<i>I worked really hard
for all this.</i>

75
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:37,654
<i>Modeling? Why don't you try
something more challenging,</i>

76
00:04:37,654 --> 00:04:39,487
<i>like a game show host?</i>

77
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,528
<i>What happened
to our plans--</i>

78
00:04:41,528 --> 00:04:44,086
<i>You and me,
the apartment together?</i>

79
00:04:44,086 --> 00:04:46,189
<i>I can't go.</i>

80
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:47,597
<i>Clay...</i>

81
00:04:49,369 --> 00:04:51,462
<i>because I don't want to.</i>

82
00:04:55,843 --> 00:04:58,038
<i>Because I'm afraid to, OK?</i>

83
00:04:59,847 --> 00:05:01,974
<i>This is
where I live.</i>

84
00:05:01,974 --> 00:05:05,212
<i>Because I'm afraid, OK?
I am.</i>

85
00:05:05,212 --> 00:05:07,549
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

86
00:05:19,967 --> 00:05:22,401
<i>Take care of Blair
for me.</i>

87
00:05:22,401 --> 00:05:25,404
<i>Forget about her
and go east, young man.</i>

88
00:05:25,404 --> 00:05:28,407
<i>Hot cocoa, girls
with woolen knee socks.</i>

89
00:05:28,407 --> 00:05:29,407
<i>Huh?</i>

90
00:05:29,407 --> 00:05:30,443
<i>Bye.</i>

91
00:05:30,443 --> 00:05:32,671
<i>Don't forget
the high-IQ pussy,</i>

92
00:05:32,671 --> 00:05:35,112
<i>''On leaf he walks, ''</i>

93
00:05:35,112 --> 00:05:37,309

94

<i>L.L. Bean.</i>

95
00:05:39,443 --> 00:05:42,852
<i>Take care of Blair
for me.</i>

96
00:05:55,335 --> 00:05:56,927
<i>Happy Thanksgiving,
Julian.</i>

97
00:05:56,927 --> 00:05:58,767
<i>Needed time, Blair?</i>

98
00:05:58,767 --> 00:06:02,536
<i>It didn't take much time
to fuck my best friend.</i>

99
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:15,420
#Time, time, time #

100
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:22,284

105
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,659
# I was so hard to please #

106
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:57,060

00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,757
# Leaves are brown #

108
00:06:58,757 --> 00:07:00,197
#And the sky #

109
00:07:00,197 --> 00:07:04,203
# Is a hazy shade of winter #

110
00:07:04,203 --> 00:07:07,297

122
00:07:34,361 --> 00:07:36,732

00:07:36,732 --> 00:07:40,239
#That you can build them again #

124
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:41,706

125
00:07:41,706 --> 00:07:43,242

#Won't you stop and remember me? #

132

00:09:59,173 --> 00:10:02,404
# Keep on dancin',
and the room gets so hot #

169
00:10:02,404 --> 00:10:04,002
#You drive us wild #

170
00:10:04,002 --> 00:10:06,673
#We'll drive you crazy #

171
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,676
#And you say you want to
go for a spin #

172
00:10:11,676 --> 00:10:15,189
#The party's startin',
babe, I'll let you in #

173
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:16,747
#You drive us wild #

174
00:10:16,747 --> 00:10:19,692
#We'll drive you crazy #

175
00:10:19,692 --> 00:10:21,194
Hey, Trent.

176
00:10:21,194 --> 00:10:23,697
Hey, nice tan.

177
00:10:27,436 --> 00:10:32,533
# I wanna rock and roll
all nite #

178
00:10:32,533 --> 00:10:34,371
#And party every day #

179
00:10:34,371 --> 00:10:36,707
Hi, Clay.

180
00:10:36,707 --> 00:10:38,871
Hey, Eddie.

181
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,710
#And party every day #

182
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:45,219
# I wanna rock and roll
all nite #

183
00:10:45,219 --> 00:10:47,016
#And party every day #

184
00:10:47,016 --> 00:10:51,719
# I wanna rock and roll
all nite #

185
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:53,556
#And party every day... #

186
00:10:56,298 --> 00:10:58,232
When did you
get back?

187
00:10:58,232 --> 00:10:59,232
Yesterday.

188
00:10:59,232 --> 00:11:01,826
How's M.I.T.?

189
00:11:01,826 --> 00:11:04,168
It's weird
and stimulating.

190
00:11:04,168 --> 00:11:08,073
Did you know you have television sets
between your legs?

191
00:11:08,073 --> 00:11:10,407
I'll see you later.

192
00:11:10,407 --> 00:11:12,674
#You show us
everything you g-g-g-got #

193
00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:15,774
# Baby, baby,
that's quite a lot #

194
00:11:15,774 --> 00:11:17,409
#You drive us wild #

195
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:21,616
#We'll drive you crazy #

196
00:11:21,616 --> 00:11:23,180
#You keep on shoutin' #

197
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,691
#You keep on shoutin'... #

198
00:11:24,691 --> 00:11:26,694
Happy holidays, sport.

199
00:11:26,694 --> 00:11:29,697
Nothing like a small,
intimate gathering among friends.

200
00:11:29,697 --> 00:11:33,201
I'm hoping for a little
seasonal caroling myself.

201
00:11:33,201 --> 00:11:35,202
When did you
get back?

202
00:11:35,202 --> 00:11:36,202
This morning.

203
00:11:36,202 --> 00:11:38,205
Are you gonna stay
a while?

204
00:11:38,205 --> 00:11:40,207
Yeah.
How are you doing?

205
00:11:40,207 --> 00:11:42,209
Working for a living.

206
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:43,209
Working?

207
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:46,213
Well, my fingers
to the bone, friend.

208
00:11:46,213 --> 00:11:48,215
Are you staying
in school?

209
00:11:48,215 --> 00:11:49,215
Yeah.

210
00:11:49,215 --> 00:11:52,219
Don't fuck off.
Don't be a bum.

211
00:11:52,219 --> 00:11:53,720
Like you?

212
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,723
Just like me.

213
00:11:55,723 --> 00:11:59,693
You look like you could use
a little Christmas cheer.

214
00:11:59,693 --> 00:12:00,659
No.

215
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:03,664
Come on, Clay.
Old habits never die.

216
00:12:03,664 --> 00:12:05,791
They just hibernate.

217
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,425
Old dealers?

218
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:09,493
They go to jail, right?

219
00:12:09,493 --> 00:12:12,506
Play handball
with the Wall Street guys.

220
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:15,372
You don't belong here.
These people are assholes.

221
00:12:15,372 --> 00:12:18,436
Who gives a fuck
about these people?

222
00:12:18,436 --> 00:12:21,573
I don't know, Rip.
Good customers though, huh?

223
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:23,015
Bread and butter.

224
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,612
Blair's upstairs.

225
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:33,784
# I wanna rock and roll
all nite #

226
00:12:33,784 --> 00:12:35,625
#And party every day #

227
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,530
# I wanna rock and roll
all nite #

228
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,192
Ahh!

229
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,964
#And party every day #

230
00:12:41,964 --> 00:12:45,973
# I wanna rock and roll
all nite ##

231
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,303
Sammy!

232
00:12:47,303 --> 00:12:51,312
...Keep right
on the floor.

233
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,747
They really belong
to the company.

234
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:15,200
Hello, Clay.

235
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,602
Bye, Blair.

236
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:28,115
Hi, Clay.

237
00:13:28,115 --> 00:13:28,865
Hi.

238
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,716
Merry Christmas.

239
00:13:31,716 --> 00:13:32,947
Merry Christmas.

240
00:13:32,947 --> 00:13:34,886
You look pale.

241
00:13:34,886 --> 00:13:38,790
Santa's gonna put
a suntan in my stocking.

242
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,794
So how's school?

243
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:44,297
Great.

244
00:13:44,297 --> 00:13:46,300
You know, school.

245
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:49,928
Well, you--
you look great.

246
00:13:49,928 --> 00:13:51,870
I thought
I looked pale.

247
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,738
Well, you look
pale and great.

248
00:13:54,738 --> 00:13:56,300
Have you seen Julian?

249
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,050
No.

250
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,238
He misses you--

251
00:14:00,238 --> 00:14:02,840
The three of us--
like high school.

252
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,580
Why did you call?

253
00:14:07,322 --> 00:14:09,586
I wanted to.

254
00:14:09,586 --> 00:14:11,250
Good reason.

255
00:14:12,994 --> 00:14:14,928
Well, there's more.

256
00:14:14,928 --> 00:14:15,928
I'm here.

257
00:14:17,332 --> 00:14:20,267
I think Julian’s
in a lot of trouble.

258
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:21,267
Julian?

259
00:14:21,267 --> 00:14:24,271
I didn't know
who else to call.

260
00:14:24,271 --> 00:14:27,274
- I can think of 500 people downstairs.
- No, he's in trouble.

261
00:14:29,177 --> 00:14:31,111
Old trouble
or new trouble?

262
00:14:31,111 --> 00:14:35,115
He disappears and comes back
like nothing happened.

263
00:14:35,115 --> 00:14:37,117
He's wasted
all the time.

264
00:14:37,117 --> 00:14:40,120
Julian's been doing that
since he was 10.

265
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,179
No, he gets
really sick.

266
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:45,124
It's not like you remember.
Talk to him.

267
00:14:45,124 --> 00:14:49,789
- I didn't come home to talk to Julian.
- Please.

268
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:51,765
- I got to go.
- No, um--

269
00:14:53,368 --> 00:14:55,768
Do you ever think
about me?

270
00:14:55,768 --> 00:14:56,608
Do you?

271
00:14:58,707 --> 00:14:59,799
Yeah.

272
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:03,243
All the time.

273
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:13,485
# Kick it #

274
00:15:13,485 --> 00:15:14,749
#Yeah #

275
00:15:21,263 --> 00:15:23,458
No, not beautiful
beautiful--

276
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:24,499
<i>Beautiful.</i>

277
00:15:24,499 --> 00:15:26,431
- Who's he going with?
- Nobody!

278
00:15:26,431 --> 00:15:28,435
<i>Who was he
going with?</i>

279
00:15:28,435 --> 00:15:30,334
He is not a slut.

280
00:15:30,334 --> 00:15:33,272
He hasn't slept with anybody.
He's a nun!

281
00:15:33,272 --> 00:15:34,774
Swear?

282
00:15:34,774 --> 00:15:36,777
He slept
with Kim--once.

283
00:15:36,777 --> 00:15:38,676
The hit list.

284
00:15:40,115 --> 00:15:41,275
Hey!

285
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:44,785
Tequila shot,
and a shotgun for my buddy.

286
00:15:44,785 --> 00:15:46,787
What do you think?

287
00:15:46,787 --> 00:15:49,289
It's one barrel,
two shots, huh?

288
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:51,825
Quench that thirst
for revenge?

289
00:15:56,097 --> 00:15:58,031
- When did you get back?
- Today.

290
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:03,797
Well, you look
very collegiate.

291
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,132
- How was it?
- What?

292
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,198
School.

293
00:16:09,478 --> 00:16:11,275
Harder than I thought.

294
00:16:13,815 --> 00:16:15,407
Still pissed?

295
00:16:18,053 --> 00:16:18,985
No.

296
00:16:20,388 --> 00:16:21,446
Liar.

297
00:16:21,446 --> 00:16:22,956
I'm not.

298
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:30,928
Well, it's been sentimental.
Got to go.

299
00:16:35,103 --> 00:16:36,764
# Bo di di bo
de bo di di bo #

300
00:16:36,764 --> 00:16:38,567
# Bum  di di bum di di bum #

301
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:39,607
#Yeah #

302
00:16:39,607 --> 00:16:41,608
#Ah, yeah, hey, ah #

303
00:16:41,608 --> 00:16:42,768
# Bom did dee ba #

304
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,277
# Don't you know it? ##

305
00:16:44,277 --> 00:16:46,405
We'll bring Clay with us.
Clay!

306
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,415
- Clay!
- Clay!

307
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:49,973
- Hello!
- Hi!

308
00:16:49,973 --> 00:16:51,279
I'm out of here,
guys.

309
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,288
No, you're not.
This is the holiday hour.

310
00:16:54,288 --> 00:16:56,290
You can't argue
with him.

311
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:59,293
We'll go out--
just the three of us.

312
00:16:59,293 --> 00:17:01,727
Whoa! Blackout!

313
00:17:01,727 --> 00:17:04,731
Listen, you must party
with Julian and Blair.

314
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:07,734
How long is this
going to last?

315
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:09,736
I'm out of here,
guys.

316
00:17:09,736 --> 00:17:12,170
I will beg.
Blair will plead.

317
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,730
Please.

318
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,241
Please.

319
00:17:15,241 --> 00:17:17,244
Ok, fine.
It's your loss.

320
00:17:19,548 --> 00:17:20,480
Let's do it!

321
00:17:21,979 --> 00:17:23,139
#Jingle bells #

322
00:17:23,139 --> 00:17:24,475
#Jingle bells #

323
00:17:24,475 --> 00:17:26,982
#Jingle all the way #

324
00:17:26,982 --> 00:17:29,041
# Oh, what fun
it is to ride #

325
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,019
# In a red Corvette today #

326
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:31,884
# Hey, hey, hey #

327
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,183
#Jingle bells #

328
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,451
#Jingle bells #

329
00:17:34,451 --> 00:17:35,992
#Jingle-- Hark #

330
00:17:35,992 --> 00:17:38,619
#The herald angels sing #

331
00:17:38,619 --> 00:17:40,390
# Fa la la la la #

332
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,056
# La la la la #

333
00:17:42,056 --> 00:17:43,622
# 'Tis the season #

334
00:17:43,622 --> 00:17:45,668
Where are we going?

335
00:17:45,668 --> 00:17:47,499
Where'd we used to go?

336
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,664
# La la ha ha #

337
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,671
# Silent night #

338
00:17:56,671 --> 00:17:59,944
# Holy night #

339
00:17:59,944 --> 00:18:03,384
# Round yon virgin #

340
00:18:03,384 --> 00:18:04,648
Me?

341
00:18:04,648 --> 00:18:06,052
# Mother and child ##

342
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:06,782
Julian!

343
00:18:07,858 --> 00:18:09,257
Come here!

344
00:18:13,864 --> 00:18:15,161
Thank you.

345
00:18:22,105 --> 00:18:23,470
Oh, what do I do?

346
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,475
You guys have heard
of the Panic Club?

347
00:18:26,475 --> 00:18:28,477
Ninth and Figueroa.

348
00:18:28,477 --> 00:18:30,308
You guys are from Reseda?
Just kidding.

349
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:32,348
No, I'm about to own it.

350
00:18:32,348 --> 00:18:35,317
Be nice to Julian,
would you, please?

351
00:18:35,317 --> 00:18:36,567
Sure.

352
00:18:37,855 --> 00:18:41,484
You don't understand.
He tried so hard.

353
00:18:41,484 --> 00:18:45,119
That record deal fell apart.
He lost his money his father gave him.

354
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,163
But he wouldn't give up.

355
00:18:47,163 --> 00:18:49,324
He borrowed money from Rip.

356
00:18:49,324 --> 00:18:51,458
He worked day and night.

357
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:54,299
He did everything he could
to keep it going.

358
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,168
Nothing helped.

359
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:58,174
Julian was so hurt.

360
00:18:58,174 --> 00:19:03,270
I don't think he ever really,
you know, failed before.

361
00:19:04,214 --> 00:19:05,943
He got high
all the time.

362
00:19:05,943 --> 00:19:09,952
Once he faced his father,
he was so fucked up

363
00:19:09,952 --> 00:19:12,488
Mr. Wells finally
kicked him out.

364
00:19:15,192 --> 00:19:18,127
Julian needs you, Clay.
He was always there for you.

365
00:19:23,467 --> 00:19:24,798
Hey.

366
00:19:26,703 --> 00:19:30,139
Cheer up, will you?
It's Christmas.

367
00:19:30,139 --> 00:19:32,437
Remember the infamous
coffee cup?

368
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,568
Oh, no, don't, please.

369
00:19:34,568 --> 00:19:38,638
Oh, yes. How to seduce Blair
without really trying.

370
00:19:38,638 --> 00:19:41,912
There's the smile.
It's nice to see it again.

371
00:19:46,657 --> 00:19:49,888
10 years together--
that's half our lives.

372
00:20:01,738 --> 00:20:05,174
# Livin' in a shack
in a one-horse town #

373
00:20:05,174 --> 00:20:08,734
#Tryin' to get to heaven
'fore the sun goin' down #

374
00:20:08,734 --> 00:20:13,010
# Lizard in a bottle, yeah #

375
00:20:14,384 --> 00:20:18,081
# Dizzy in a haze
for 40 days #

376
00:20:18,081 --> 00:20:21,181
# Hey there,
little devil #

377
00:20:21,181 --> 00:20:23,192
Got a minute,
sweetheart?

378
00:20:23,192 --> 00:20:24,693
Surely.

379
00:20:24,693 --> 00:20:27,355
We gots to talk
business, friend.

380
00:20:27,355 --> 00:20:30,195
Relax. I'll pay you.
Just trust me.

381
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:32,701
I don't want to
trust you.

382
00:20:32,701 --> 00:20:35,203
I just want my 50K.

383
00:20:35,203 --> 00:20:37,206
Patience is next
to godliness.

384
00:20:37,206 --> 00:20:39,708
It's the flip side
of cleanliness,

385
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,710
but it's still pretty
fuckin' important.

386
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:44,212
What are we talking about,
Julian?

387
00:20:44,212 --> 00:20:48,217
- You giving me a ''G'' on spec.
- No. No way.

388
00:20:48,217 --> 00:20:52,221
Very attractive girls
falling all over me for some blow.

389
00:20:52,221 --> 00:20:53,916
Just hook me.

390
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:54,958
No.

391
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,357
This is the last time.

392
00:20:59,796 --> 00:21:02,856
As soon as the club deal goes through,
I'm recashing you every penny.

393
00:21:02,856 --> 00:21:04,366
I hope so.

394
00:21:04,366 --> 00:21:06,425
Well, don't hope.
Trust.

395
00:21:06,425 --> 00:21:09,995
# Lizard in a bottle, yeah #

396
00:21:09,995 --> 00:21:13,600
# Come in, little devil #

397
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,169
# Be my little angel #

398
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:20,978
# Come on, little devil #

399
00:21:20,978 --> 00:21:26,455
# Be my-y-y a-a-angel ##

400
00:21:31,595 --> 00:21:32,926
# I believe #

401
00:21:40,537 --> 00:21:41,435
# I believe #

402
00:21:51,048 --> 00:21:52,208
Huh?

403
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:55,217
- What are you listening to?
- What?

404
00:21:55,217 --> 00:21:56,684
I can't...

405
00:22:01,091 --> 00:22:02,888
some kind of
Eastern philosophy?

406
00:22:04,061 --> 00:22:05,153
# I believe ya #

407
00:22:15,906 --> 00:22:17,498
# I believe #

408
00:22:17,498 --> 00:22:18,666
# I believe #

409
00:22:18,666 --> 00:22:19,436
# I believe ##

410
00:22:26,483 --> 00:22:28,348
What's your name?

411
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:29,180
Richard.

412
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,082
Hi.

413
00:22:33,757 --> 00:22:36,692
You're gonna give me
a negative self-image.

414
00:22:36,692 --> 00:22:38,193
Impossible.

415
00:22:38,193 --> 00:22:40,422
This is great,
isn't it?

416
00:22:40,422 --> 00:22:43,261
The three of us together,
seeing you again.

417
00:22:44,401 --> 00:22:46,301
You happy or sad?

418
00:22:46,301 --> 00:22:48,963
I'm not sad.

419
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,473
You don't look happy.

420
00:22:51,473 --> 00:22:53,873
But do I look good?

421
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,969
Always.

422
00:22:55,969 --> 00:22:58,844
You're gonna get
real serious now, huh?

423
00:23:01,384 --> 00:23:02,134
No.

424
00:23:04,054 --> 00:23:05,715
I'm sorry.

425
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,658
What for?

426
00:23:08,658 --> 00:23:10,022
Everything.

427
00:23:12,229 --> 00:23:14,424
It doesn't matter anymore.

428
00:23:14,424 --> 00:23:16,989
I just wish that you knew.

429
00:23:16,989 --> 00:23:20,161
It's not the same
with you and me.

430
00:23:20,161 --> 00:23:22,102
It's not the same.

431
00:23:22,102 --> 00:23:23,935
Well, what's it like?

432
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:28,171
When you left,
you left the both of us.

433
00:23:28,171 --> 00:23:31,180
Everything just changed
so quickly.

434
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,182
Julian needed somebody.

435
00:23:33,182 --> 00:23:35,946
I guess I needed
somebody, too.

436
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,154
It doesn't matter.
Forget it.

437
00:23:39,154 --> 00:23:41,690
- Did you talk to Julian?
- No.

438
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,692
I asked you
to talk to him.

439
00:23:43,692 --> 00:23:46,695
All right, I'll call Betty Ford,
get him a room.

440
00:23:46,695 --> 00:23:50,199
-Just talk to him. He's your friend too.
-It's funny.

441
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:54,704
When you called me,
I thought I was coming home to see you.

442
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:04,723
# Stop actin' so crazy #

443
00:24:04,723 --> 00:24:08,132
#You say your mommy ain't home,
it ain't my concern #

444
00:24:08,132 --> 00:24:11,899
#Just don't play with me,
and you won't get burned #

445
00:24:11,899 --> 00:24:14,736
# I have only
one itchin' desire #

446
00:24:14,736 --> 00:24:18,267
# Let me stand
next to your fire #

447
00:24:18,267 --> 00:24:19,812
# Stand, yeah #

448
00:24:19,812 --> 00:24:23,077
# Let me stand, baby #

449
00:24:23,077 --> 00:24:25,744
# Let me stand #

450
00:24:25,744 --> 00:24:28,914
# Ohh, let me stand #

451
00:24:28,914 --> 00:24:30,923
#Aow! #

452
00:24:30,923 --> 00:24:33,926
# Oh, move over, Rover #

453
00:24:33,926 --> 00:24:36,986
#And let Jimi take over #

454
00:24:36,986 --> 00:24:40,192
#Yeah, you know
what I'm talkin' about #

455
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,758
#Yeah,
get on with it, baby #

456
00:24:57,017 --> 00:24:58,609
#That's what I'm
talkin' about #

457
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,978
# Now, dig this #

458
00:25:05,526 --> 00:25:07,050
# Now, listen, baby #

459
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,618
#You try to give me
your money #

460
00:25:08,618 --> 00:25:10,823
#You better save it, babe #

461
00:25:10,823 --> 00:25:13,890
# Save it
for your rainy day #

462
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:16,994
# I have only
one burnin' desire #

463
00:25:16,994 --> 00:25:19,835
# Let me stand
next to your fire ##

464
00:25:35,156 --> 00:25:37,249
Thought I'd
find you here.

465
00:25:37,249 --> 00:25:40,088
I'm having trouble
at home.

466
00:25:40,088 --> 00:25:42,095
Which one?

467
00:25:42,095 --> 00:25:44,097
All of them.

468
00:25:47,501 --> 00:25:49,594
Who drove?

469
00:25:49,594 --> 00:25:51,433
You did.

470
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,398
Ahh.

471
00:25:54,398 --> 00:25:56,602
Oh, parking is key.

472
00:25:57,678 --> 00:26:00,044
You ever think
about going back?

473
00:26:00,044 --> 00:26:01,046
Where?

474
00:26:01,046 --> 00:26:03,049
School. I did.

475
00:26:03,049 --> 00:26:05,051
I just like
dropped by,

476
00:26:05,051 --> 00:26:07,053
took a nostalgic
walk around.

477
00:26:07,053 --> 00:26:08,053
And?

478
00:26:08,053 --> 00:26:10,056
It was weird.

479
00:26:10,056 --> 00:26:12,558
All the kids
had grown up.

480
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:16,062
It wasn't like it was
when we were there.

481
00:26:16,062 --> 00:26:18,098
Think they miss us?

482
00:26:18,098 --> 00:26:18,848
No.

483
00:26:19,967 --> 00:26:23,562
Come on, Clay Easton,
Julian Wells--

484
00:26:23,562 --> 00:26:25,070
Legends, baby.

485
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:27,073
We could do anything.

486
00:26:27,073 --> 00:26:29,575
What are you going to do?

487
00:26:29,575 --> 00:26:31,406
Take a nap.

488
00:26:31,406 --> 00:26:33,070
After that?

489
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,079
Business.

490
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:36,082
Are you dealing?

491
00:26:36,082 --> 00:26:39,085
My most lofty ambition
is to deal.

492
00:26:39,085 --> 00:26:41,087
You look bad.

493
00:26:41,087 --> 00:26:43,589
What's going on?
I'm serious.

494
00:26:43,589 --> 00:26:47,593
I'm seriously getting frustrated
with these questions.

495
00:26:47,593 --> 00:26:50,596
Someday we're gonna
look back on this.

496
00:26:50,596 --> 00:26:52,598
It's all gonna seem groovy.

497
00:27:02,009 --> 00:27:05,206
- Are you going to see Blair?
- Yeah. She's working downtown.

498
00:27:08,115 --> 00:27:10,049
Give her my love.

499
00:27:19,827 --> 00:27:22,057
The soap is fine.

500
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,563
There are flecks on her neck.

501
00:27:24,563 --> 00:27:27,066
You can't see anything.

502
00:27:27,066 --> 00:27:29,398
Take care of the flecks.

503
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,563
Great. Great.

504
00:27:32,973 --> 00:27:36,067
Sign the contracts
for next week's shoot.

505
00:27:36,067 --> 00:27:38,338
We got to get
them signed.

506
00:27:38,338 --> 00:27:42,143
If you want a new bar,
get rid of the flecks.

507
00:27:42,143 --> 00:27:45,777
This shoot better be over by Friday.
I've got Rose Bowl tickets.

508
00:27:53,827 --> 00:27:56,261
Come in.

509
00:28:01,835 --> 00:28:02,585
Hi.

510
00:28:03,337 --> 00:28:07,034
I always wondered about
the glamorous life of a fashion model.

511
00:28:07,034 --> 00:28:09,541
Well, now you know.

512
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:12,044
Oh, my neck
is killing me.

513
00:28:12,044 --> 00:28:14,046
Will you rub my neck?

514
00:28:14,046 --> 00:28:15,046
Yeah.

515
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:22,054
- I spoke with Julian.
- Yeah?

516
00:28:22,054 --> 00:28:24,386
He doesn't want my help.

517
00:28:24,386 --> 00:28:28,053
Oh, Julian is a mess.
He's out of control.

518
00:28:28,053 --> 00:28:30,062
You saw him.

519
00:28:30,062 --> 00:28:32,064
And you're not?

520
00:28:32,064 --> 00:28:34,066
I can quit anytime.

521
00:28:34,066 --> 00:28:37,069
It's all the control
I need.

522
00:28:37,069 --> 00:28:38,695
I'm impressed.

523
00:28:40,574 --> 00:28:44,374
Do you want to go out tonight?
We could go to some clubs.

524
00:28:45,412 --> 00:28:46,162
No.

525
00:28:48,349 --> 00:28:50,749
I'm taking off
right after Christmas.

526
00:28:50,749 --> 00:28:52,115
Why?

527
00:28:52,115 --> 00:28:55,417
Things didn't work out
the way I thought.

528
00:28:57,658 --> 00:29:01,059
I thought you
were staying longer.

529
00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:04,120
I was hoping we could
spend some time together.

530
00:29:05,065 --> 00:29:07,033
Well, maybe next time.

531
00:29:07,033 --> 00:29:09,535
Yeah, next time.

532
00:29:09,535 --> 00:29:11,935
I'll call you
before I go.

533
00:29:11,935 --> 00:29:12,937
- Will you?
- Yeah.

534
00:29:12,937 --> 00:29:14,940
Okay, great.

535
00:29:17,444 --> 00:29:18,536
Bye.

536
00:29:22,116 --> 00:29:24,846
I miss you.

537
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:36,052
Where the hell
is everybody?

538
00:29:36,052 --> 00:29:38,064
Robbie-nobb?

539
00:29:49,476 --> 00:29:54,914

540

541

542
00:30:01,588 --> 00:30:03,088
Julian!

543

Uncle Bob.

544
00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:06,083
You're early.

545
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:11,154
This is a matter of great consequence
and potential global expansion.

546
00:30:11,154 --> 00:30:13,426
I'll bet.
How much?

547
00:30:13,426 --> 00:30:14,426
15K.

548
00:30:15,669 --> 00:30:18,103
Please drive.

549
00:30:19,673 --> 00:30:22,107
Very good stereo.

550

<i># Who's that girl cryin'? ##</i>

551
00:30:28,315 --> 00:30:30,442
Why don't you borrow it
from your father?

552
00:30:30,442 --> 00:30:33,611
Come on. Dad lacks
a certain amount of imagination.

553
00:30:35,189 --> 00:30:36,622
Nightclubs?

554
00:30:36,622 --> 00:30:38,624
This is not
just any nightclub.

555
00:30:38,624 --> 00:30:42,492
<i>This is the infamous
Panic Club.</i>

556
00:30:42,492 --> 00:30:45,589
The ex-owner is now into conceptual
art-- another good money move--

557
00:30:45,589 --> 00:30:48,601
but what he's done thusly
is left behind a gold mine.

558
00:30:48,601 --> 00:30:50,136
I'm talking Panic addicts--

559
00:30:50,136 --> 00:30:54,197
kids who want fake fashion,
loud music every weekend religiously.

560
00:30:54,197 --> 00:30:58,142
I want to provide it for them,
at a reasonable fee, of course.

561
00:30:58,142 --> 00:31:02,740
Of course, but I am not
into investing into clubs.

562
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,750
I know,
but it is a sure thing.

563
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:07,082
It's low overhead.
There's high volume.

564
00:31:07,082 --> 00:31:10,089
It's the most strictly controlled
all-money business.

565
00:31:10,089 --> 00:31:12,591
It's not just
investing in a club.

566
00:31:12,591 --> 00:31:16,288
You're investing
in a blood relative.

567
00:31:16,288 --> 00:31:18,854
- 15 grand?
- I'm the son you never had.

568
00:31:18,854 --> 00:31:21,867
I got two sons.
I can't afford any more.

569
00:31:21,867 --> 00:31:25,871
But they're not like me.
So don't make me beg.

570
00:31:25,871 --> 00:31:29,272
- Okay, where is the place? Let's look.
- Cool.

571
00:31:29,272 --> 00:31:30,605
- You wanna bum?
- Please.

572
00:31:30,605 --> 00:31:32,110
My office.

573
00:31:50,197 --> 00:31:51,630
Dad?

574
00:31:57,204 --> 00:31:58,204
Dad?

575
00:32:25,165 --> 00:32:26,165
Dad?

576
00:32:27,334 --> 00:32:29,097
Hi, honey.

577
00:32:29,097 --> 00:32:31,103
I brought you a present.

578
00:32:31,103 --> 00:32:32,604
Wait a minute.

579
00:32:32,604 --> 00:32:34,607
I'll be right out.

580
00:32:34,607 --> 00:32:36,609
No, I gotta go.

581
00:32:36,609 --> 00:32:39,111
You sure?
Cindy'll order out.

582
00:32:39,111 --> 00:32:40,976
Sorry, I can't.

583
00:32:40,976 --> 00:32:42,606
Anything I can do for you?

584
00:32:42,606 --> 00:32:44,617
No, I'm fine.

585
00:32:44,617 --> 00:32:46,118
Merry Christmas.

586
00:32:46,118 --> 00:32:48,120
I'll see you Monday.

587
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,122
Merry Christmas.

588
00:32:51,692 --> 00:32:54,627
I left your present
on the table.

589
00:32:54,627 --> 00:32:56,128
Thanks, sweetheart.

590
00:32:58,198 --> 00:33:01,565
Hi, Blair.
You look great.

591
00:33:01,565 --> 00:33:03,569
Thanks.

592
00:33:03,569 --> 00:33:05,571
Listen. If I don't see you,
merry Christmas.

593
00:33:05,571 --> 00:33:07,072
Oh, you, too.

594
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:07,822
OK.

595
00:33:08,642 --> 00:33:10,075
Cindy.

596
00:33:57,636 --> 00:34:00,503
I didn't expect
to see you here.

597
00:34:00,503 --> 00:34:02,005
Changed my mind.

598
00:34:02,005 --> 00:34:04,008

00:34:22,851 --> 00:34:24,862
-Julian!
- Oh, it's okay. He's familiar.

Still, don't you think a little
goddamn consolation is in order?

Just don't.

to even out. You want a drink?

I want nothing from you.

Now, that's a surprise,
Julian.

614
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:51,783
Julian, don't start.

everything this evening.

all right?

00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:41,572

- No, it-- no.

00:41:39,031 --> 00:41:40,965
- I have a better idea.
- What?

660
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:42,967
- Let's get married.
- Great.

661
00:41:44,103 --> 00:41:46,037
We'll have a big,
expensive wedding.

662
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:49,666
We'll invite 2,000
of our closest friends.

663
00:41:49,666 --> 00:41:52,677
We'll have a couple kids
and find a great maid to raise them.

664
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,872
- I'll raise them.
- You will?

665
00:41:56,615 --> 00:41:58,549
Can't we just
stay together?

666
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:02,713
I'm going to school in a week, and
I'm shoving your ass in the suitcase.

667
00:42:02,713 --> 00:42:04,881
Come to my house for dinner.

668
00:42:04,881 --> 00:42:08,154
My dad'll be there,
and the whole family.

669
00:42:08,154 --> 00:42:10,252
It's Christmas, you know.

670
00:42:11,497 --> 00:42:12,747
Ahem!

671
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:15,933
The door was open.

672
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:18,265
What do you want?

673
00:42:18,265 --> 00:42:20,931
I'm lookin' for Julian.

674
00:42:20,931 --> 00:42:22,974
Is he around?

675
00:42:22,974 --> 00:42:24,270
No.

676
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:26,174
Well, if you see him,

677
00:42:26,174 --> 00:42:29,271
you tell him
to give me a call.

678
00:42:29,271 --> 00:42:30,781
I'm Bill.

679
00:42:38,023 --> 00:42:39,957
You're Blair.

680
00:42:41,593 --> 00:42:43,527
I don't know you.

681
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:46,925
See you later.

682
00:42:49,868 --> 00:42:51,961
Where would he sleep?

683
00:42:51,961 --> 00:42:53,971
Maybe Zuma--
Markie's party.

684
00:43:39,418 --> 00:43:41,443
Somebody's
looking for you.

685
00:43:41,443 --> 00:43:42,953
Who?

686
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:46,718
Bill.
You know him?

687
00:43:46,718 --> 00:43:48,953
Bill--Billy.
He's very cool.

688
00:43:48,953 --> 00:43:51,086
He's an old friend.

689
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:52,824
I don't remember him.

690
00:43:52,824 --> 00:43:55,458
You've been away
for a long time.

691
00:43:55,458 --> 00:43:57,900
I've met a lot of new
and interesting people.

692
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,063
Why? Where'd you two meet?

693
00:44:00,063 --> 00:44:02,903
At the loft with Blair.

694
00:44:02,903 --> 00:44:04,909
# Dum da da dum ##

695
00:44:04,909 --> 00:44:06,911
Want to talk about it?

696
00:44:06,911 --> 00:44:07,911
No.

697
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:10,710
- Do you want to fight?
- Nope.

698
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:14,412
Congratulations.
This is the way it's supposed to be.

699
00:44:14,412 --> 00:44:16,420
Turnabout is fair play.

700
00:44:18,824 --> 00:44:20,758
Blair was good to me.

701
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:23,761
I was lonely,
and I needed somebody.

702
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:26,263
She was there.
It was nice.

703
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:31,030
It wasn't exactly
the World Series of love, though.

704
00:44:35,741 --> 00:44:38,437
Oh, this is my club.

705
00:44:38,437 --> 00:44:41,604
Check me out.
I'm going to make a serious comeback.

706
00:44:41,604 --> 00:44:43,170
Great!

707
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:46,445
Yeah, and I'll sneak in and take Blair
away when you least expect it.

708
00:44:46,445 --> 00:44:48,884
This will go on for years.

709
00:44:48,884 --> 00:44:51,047
What?

710
00:44:54,026 --> 00:44:57,393
Be good to her.
She really deserves it.

711
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,893
Yeah.

712
00:45:03,893 --> 00:45:05,903
I'm going to go.

713
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:08,405
Always leaving, you.

714
00:45:08,405 --> 00:45:10,407
Well, somebody's got to.

715
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:11,908
Ha ha!

716
00:45:11,908 --> 00:45:13,911
Watch out for the sharks.

717
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:16,106
- What about you?
- They know me.

718
00:45:16,106 --> 00:45:18,115
All right.
You need anything?

719
00:45:19,985 --> 00:45:21,418
All right.

720
00:45:41,006 --> 00:45:45,943
Thank you, Elaine,
for having us in your home.

721
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:48,946
<i>Well, thanks for having me.</i>

722
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:50,948
Alice, too.

723
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:54,952
Um...this is a special
time of year.

724
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:58,456
It's a time for family,
for friends.

725
00:45:58,456 --> 00:46:01,890
It's a time
for forgetting our differences,

726
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:05,896
and for coming together
so that we might...

727
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:08,899
well, uh, come together.

728
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:10,901
Ha ha ha!

729
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:13,904
It's clearly also a time
for incoherent toasts.

730
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:16,907
It's an old family
tradition here.

731
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:18,909
Um, well, merry Christmas,
everybody.

732
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:22,913
May we all
love each other as we are

733
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:25,916
and as we hope to be.

734
00:46:27,486 --> 00:46:28,919
Thanks, Elaine.

735
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:29,759
Clay...

736
00:46:31,323 --> 00:46:33,587
Liz, Jenny...

737
00:46:33,587 --> 00:46:34,787
and Alice.

738
00:46:38,897 --> 00:46:40,421
Merry Christmas.

739
00:46:40,421 --> 00:46:43,093
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

740
00:46:59,017 --> 00:47:00,814
Oh, been waiting for ages.

741
00:47:00,814 --> 00:47:02,376
Where you been?

742
00:47:02,376 --> 00:47:05,890
- Traffic in this town's a joke.
- Look at these ceilings.

743
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:09,394
The D.J. will show you around,
let you listen to the sound system.

744
00:47:09,394 --> 00:47:10,894
Look.

745
00:47:12,197 --> 00:47:14,791
This isn't a good time
for bad news.

746
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:16,390
I can't loan you the money.

747
00:47:20,973 --> 00:47:21,973
Why?

748
00:47:27,245 --> 00:47:29,907
I spoke with your father.
There's no way I can--

749
00:47:29,907 --> 00:47:32,416
I know. I know.
That's cool.

750
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:35,976
At least you tried.
Here, take a couple of these.

751
00:47:35,976 --> 00:47:38,989
They're like kind of
collector's items.

752
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:41,753
Limited edition stuff.

753
00:47:43,228 --> 00:47:45,958
This doesn't mean
you're not my favorite nephew.

754
00:47:45,958 --> 00:47:49,125
- Come to our house for Christmas.
- Great.

755
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:51,897
No, actually, I can't.
I made other plans.

756
00:47:51,897 --> 00:47:53,597
Julian...

757
00:47:55,407 --> 00:47:57,466
I'm sorry.
I really am.

758
00:47:57,466 --> 00:47:59,271
Me, too.

759
00:48:08,954 --> 00:48:10,328
Bye.

760
00:48:17,035 --> 00:48:18,468
Hey, Rip.

761
00:48:25,243 --> 00:48:28,644
<i>#I was walking down the road
the other day #</i>

762
00:48:28,644 --> 00:48:32,308
<i># When I hear
a little human say #</i>

763
00:48:32,308 --> 00:48:33,975
<i>#He said #</i>

764
00:48:36,054 --> 00:48:39,319
<i># You no see
me situation #</i>

765
00:48:39,319 --> 00:48:43,326
<i># You don't have
no accommodation #</i>

766
00:48:43,326 --> 00:48:46,989
<i>#Me have to sign on
at the station #</i>

767
00:48:46,989 --> 00:48:50,000
<i>#At 6:00
in the evenin'...##</i>

768
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:00,878
You have something for me?

769
00:49:03,014 --> 00:49:06,450
Man, I had it
all worked out.

770
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:08,451
Christ, I thought I did.

771
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:12,949
I fucked up.
I don't have any money.

772
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:16,892
I don't know where
I'm going to get it.

773
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,125
Julian,
this cannot go on forever.

774
00:49:24,125 --> 00:49:26,136
You owe me a lot of cash.

775
00:49:26,136 --> 00:49:28,638
I'm carrying you
like I'm stupid.

776
00:49:28,638 --> 00:49:30,469
But if you just
give me a chance--

777
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:32,475
Please don't cut me off.

778
00:49:32,475 --> 00:49:34,477
I'll do whatever you want.

779
00:49:36,247 --> 00:49:38,477
Listen, uh...

780
00:49:38,477 --> 00:49:41,985
I want you to do
a favor for me.

781
00:49:41,985 --> 00:49:43,235
Sure.

782
00:49:44,622 --> 00:49:48,991
You're going to work for me, just
for a while, till we're even-Steven.

783
00:49:48,991 --> 00:49:51,961
Business? Like sales?
I can do that.

784
00:49:51,961 --> 00:49:54,999
I just want you
to meet some people.

785
00:49:54,999 --> 00:49:57,830
They're very cool.
You'll like them.

786
00:49:57,830 --> 00:50:00,336
These are very important people,
Julian.

787
00:50:00,336 --> 00:50:02,066
Cool.

788
00:50:02,066 --> 00:50:04,165
Bill's gonna take you there.

789
00:50:04,165 --> 00:50:06,005
It's just a party.

790
00:50:12,083 --> 00:50:14,517
Everything's going to be
just fine.

791
00:50:14,517 --> 00:50:16,519
Even-Steven.

792
00:50:50,688 --> 00:50:52,553
# Oh, yeah! #

793
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,620
# Lookin' for love... #

794
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,665
#Tonight #

795
00:51:03,665 --> 00:51:07,000
# So shake it slowly #

796
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,006
#And do the bump 'n grind #

797
00:51:13,177 --> 00:51:15,668
#Well, I can tell
you got a few reservations #

798
00:51:15,668 --> 00:51:17,942
# More value,
bang for the buck #

799
00:51:21,419 --> 00:51:25,014
# Shake it slowly #

800
00:51:25,014 --> 00:51:27,683
#And do the bump 'n grind #

801
00:51:27,683 --> 00:51:28,919
#Whoa! ##

802
00:52:36,961 --> 00:52:38,895
You enjoy the party?

803
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:44,034
Can't hold.

804
00:52:44,034 --> 00:52:47,538
Got two more stops.
Then we'll call it a night.

805
00:52:50,608 --> 00:52:51,973
Julian!

806
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:25,008
We haven't seen you
for a while, Blair.

807
00:53:25,008 --> 00:53:27,237
I've been busy.

808
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:29,836
That's a--
a lovely dress.

809
00:53:29,836 --> 00:53:31,848
You modeling?

810
00:53:31,848 --> 00:53:34,908
Yeah, I had a great year.
Better than I expected.

811
00:53:34,908 --> 00:53:37,011
Are you planning
to go to college?

812
00:53:37,011 --> 00:53:39,249
I haven't
decided yet.

813
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:42,451
You seem happy here.

814
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:48,531
Sure.

815
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:52,035
Are you playing tennis?

816
00:53:52,035 --> 00:53:55,038
No-- My elbow.

817
00:53:55,038 --> 00:53:59,042
I tried a different wrap,
but, you know.

818
00:53:59,042 --> 00:54:00,737
Yeah.

819
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:09,982
It's a better environment for Clay,
all things considered.

820
00:54:09,982 --> 00:54:11,316
What?

821
00:54:11,316 --> 00:54:12,651
School.

822
00:54:12,651 --> 00:54:14,156
I guess so.

823
00:54:55,099 --> 00:54:58,034
What the hell
are you doing?

824
00:54:58,034 --> 00:54:59,967
Just watching.

825
00:54:59,967 --> 00:55:03,131
I feel like
Tiny-fuckin'-Tim.

826
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,254
Come inside.

827
00:55:09,254 --> 00:55:11,415
No, no,
it's too crowded.

828
00:55:14,794 --> 00:55:18,195
- What's wrong?
- Do I look like something's wrong?

829
00:55:21,334 --> 00:55:24,428
- I need money, Clay.
- How much?

830
00:55:30,343 --> 00:55:31,833
How much?

831
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,414
50,000.

832
00:55:35,414 --> 00:55:37,450
50 and change.
I could use that.

833
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:39,280
Jesus.

834
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,946
Yeah, Jesus.

835
00:55:41,946 --> 00:55:43,454
- What for?
- Drugged out.

836
00:55:43,454 --> 00:55:45,957
What do you think it's for?

837
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:50,523
- All right. I'll talk to Rip.
- No, you won't.

838
00:55:50,523 --> 00:55:52,963
You don't wanna talk to him.

839
00:55:52,963 --> 00:55:54,966
I can't get that much--

840
00:55:54,966 --> 00:55:56,729
Not right away.

841
00:56:01,975 --> 00:56:03,966
Clay, I'm fucked,
all right?

842
00:56:03,966 --> 00:56:06,011
I don't know what to do.
You're the only one.

843
00:56:06,011 --> 00:56:07,671
What happens when you pay?

844
00:56:07,671 --> 00:56:09,578
- I don't know.
- Think about it.

845
00:56:09,578 --> 00:56:12,584
- Do you start over?
- Clay, I need the fuckin' money.

846
00:56:12,584 --> 00:56:15,746
I don't need a discussion on
the finer points of morality!

847
00:56:19,659 --> 00:56:21,854
How much do you have?

848
00:56:21,854 --> 00:56:23,088
Nothing!

849
00:56:32,739 --> 00:56:33,933
I'm out of here.

850
00:56:33,933 --> 00:56:35,941
Merry Christmas.

851
00:56:35,941 --> 00:56:37,943
Wait. Just wait.

852
00:56:42,015 --> 00:56:44,950
Just wait.

853
00:56:55,361 --> 00:56:56,953
Dad?

854
00:56:56,953 --> 00:56:59,965
- Yeah?
- Got a sec?

855
00:56:59,965 --> 00:57:03,002
I need your help.
I need some dough.

856
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:05,333
- How much?
- I need 50 grand.

857
00:57:05,333 --> 00:57:06,702
50 grand?

858
00:57:06,702 --> 00:57:10,402
- You're not asking me for $50,000.
- Yeah, I am, Dad.

859
00:57:22,989 --> 00:57:24,923
What are you doing here?

860
00:57:24,923 --> 00:57:30,452
Trying to salvage what's left
of a very important relationship.

861
00:57:30,452 --> 00:57:35,297
Ah, Jenny, I've been sitting
by the phone, but it didn't ring.

862
00:57:35,297 --> 00:57:38,303
You don't call,
and you don't write.

863
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:40,305
We just don't communicate,
you know?

864
00:57:40,305 --> 00:57:43,934
It pains me deeply to accuse,
but I just--

865
00:57:43,934 --> 00:57:45,944
I suspect you're
freezing me out.

866
00:57:45,944 --> 00:57:46,944
Yes.

867
00:57:49,349 --> 00:57:52,375
You're just such
a heartless preteen hussy.

868
00:57:52,375 --> 00:57:54,943
Why are girls so cold?

869
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:55,943
Huh?

870
00:57:57,523 --> 00:57:59,457
Oh, and then she laughs.

871
00:57:59,457 --> 00:58:01,390
Girls learn this
really early.

872
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:04,055
They break guys' hearts
in pieces.

873
00:58:07,467 --> 00:58:10,402
You know what
the sick part of it all is?

874
00:58:10,402 --> 00:58:12,301
You know you love it.

875
00:58:12,301 --> 00:58:16,399
- Uh-uh.
- Don't play innocent with me.

876
00:58:16,399 --> 00:58:18,410
I know what girls like.

877
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:20,912
Diamonds are
a girl's best friend.

878
00:58:28,488 --> 00:58:30,422
Shit.

879
00:58:30,422 --> 00:58:32,924
I saw him go inside.

880
00:58:42,001 --> 00:58:44,435
Where did you get--
where's Julian?

881
00:58:44,435 --> 00:58:45,937
We were playing.

882
00:58:45,937 --> 00:58:48,940
Get that stuff off
before Ma sees you.

883
00:58:53,012 --> 00:58:54,445
Julian?

884
00:58:55,848 --> 00:58:57,110
Jesus.

885
00:58:57,110 --> 00:58:58,445
What?

886
00:58:58,445 --> 00:58:59,883
My mother's jewelry.

887
00:59:19,459 --> 00:59:20,892
Hey, Clay!

888
00:59:25,465 --> 00:59:28,400
# In-a-gadda-da-vida, baby #

889
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,902
# Don't you know
that I want you? ##

890
00:59:30,902 --> 00:59:32,404
How you doin'?

891
00:59:32,404 --> 00:59:33,905
Seen Julian?

892
00:59:33,905 --> 00:59:35,407
No, I haven't.

893
00:59:35,407 --> 00:59:39,673
- You been here all night?
- All night. Sorry.

894
00:59:39,673 --> 00:59:42,874
# It's Christmastime
in Hollis, Queens #

895
00:59:42,874 --> 00:59:45,440
# Mom's cookin' chicken
and collard greens #

896
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,885
# Rice and stuffin',
macaroni and cheese #

897
00:59:47,885 --> 00:59:50,514
#And Santa put gifts
under Christmas trees #

898
00:59:50,514 --> 00:59:52,956
# Decorate the house
with lights at night #

899
00:59:52,956 --> 00:59:55,392
# Snow's on the ground,
snow white, so bright #

900
00:59:55,392 --> 00:59:58,022
# In the fireplace
is the yule log #

901
00:59:58,022 --> 01:00:01,625
# Beneath the mistletoe
as we drink eggnog #

902
01:00:01,625 --> 01:00:03,566
You seen Julian around?

903
01:00:05,639 --> 01:00:07,072
Thanks.

904
01:00:13,146 --> 01:00:15,080
Sweetheart,
you seen Julian?

905
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,581
No, man, uh-uh.

906
01:00:20,987 --> 01:00:23,080
# Run so loud and proud
you'll hear it #

907
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,750
# It's Christmastime,
and we got the spirit #

908
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:28,158
#Jack Frost's chillin',
the hawk is south... ##

909
01:00:42,175 --> 01:00:44,109
You seen Julian?

910
01:00:44,109 --> 01:00:46,611
No, man, I haven't seen him.

911
01:01:51,678 --> 01:01:53,612
Blair, how you doin'?

912
01:01:53,612 --> 01:01:55,614
You remember Bill?

913
01:01:55,614 --> 01:01:56,364
Hi.

914
01:01:57,184 --> 01:01:59,118
You look wired tonight.

915
01:01:59,118 --> 01:02:01,347
- Is there anything I can do for you?
- No, thanks.

916
01:02:01,347 --> 01:02:03,480
- You looking for Julian?
- Bill, please.

917
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:06,492
Do you know where he is?
'Cause we called the loft, and I can't--

918
01:02:06,492 --> 01:02:09,028
-Julian doesn't stay there anymore.
- He doesn't?

919
01:02:09,028 --> 01:02:11,029
Where's Julian?

920
01:02:12,132 --> 01:02:14,066
Fuckin' game show.

921
01:02:14,066 --> 01:02:16,500
What are you doing to him?
What's going on?

922
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,003
Clay...

923
01:02:18,003 --> 01:02:21,063
Why don't you ask Julian?
I bet he knows.

924
01:02:21,063 --> 01:02:22,574
Fuck!

925
01:02:22,574 --> 01:02:27,978
Relax. Relax, sport. Julian will
show his face. He always does.

926
01:02:27,978 --> 01:02:30,573
You're on vacation.
Don't forget that. All right?

927
01:02:30,573 --> 01:02:33,084
See you later.

928
01:02:33,084 --> 01:02:35,246
# Don't be a slave #

929
01:02:35,246 --> 01:02:37,586
# No one can tell you #

930
01:02:37,586 --> 01:02:39,454
#You've got to be afraid ##

931
01:02:51,304 --> 01:02:54,432
- Let's try the beach.
- I don't want to. I wanna go home.

932
01:02:54,432 --> 01:02:56,099
You want to find Julian?

933
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:01,477
It's a coyote.

934
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:02,810
We hit it.

935
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:08,212
Nothing.

936
01:03:08,212 --> 01:03:10,552
Maybe we missed.

937
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:13,452
You OK?

938
01:03:13,452 --> 01:03:16,461
This cocaine...
too much speed or something.

939
01:03:16,461 --> 01:03:19,054
- That's a relief.
- What?

940
01:03:19,054 --> 01:03:24,934
You're fucked up, you look shitty,
but hey, all you need is better cocaine.

941
01:03:24,934 --> 01:03:26,905
You walking home?

942
01:03:26,905 --> 01:03:29,908
- I've had enough fun for one night.
- Are we having fun?

943
01:03:29,908 --> 01:03:32,911
- It doesn't feel that way to me.
- You don't know what you're saying.

944
01:03:32,911 --> 01:03:35,413
I know what you're doing.
I know what Julian is doing.

945
01:03:35,413 --> 01:03:38,417
- I'm not like Julian!
-Julian's messed up. Talk to him, Clay.

946
01:03:38,417 --> 01:03:41,579
Julian has a problem. What makes
you think you're so different?

947
01:03:41,579 --> 01:03:44,886
- You weren't here to help anybody!
- Do you want me to stay?

948
01:03:44,886 --> 01:03:47,392
- No!
- You want me to be just like you?

949
01:03:47,392 --> 01:03:50,896
Putting shit up my nose till it bleeds,
no matter how much my friends care?

950
01:03:50,896 --> 01:03:55,230
Very romantic. We'll all go down
together. I won't do it. I can't.

951
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:59,602
I love you, but I am leaving
as soon as I can.

952
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:55,719
Julian.

953
01:04:55,719 --> 01:04:56,887
Julian!

954
01:04:58,164 --> 01:05:00,098
You guys be careful!

955
01:05:00,098 --> 01:05:03,033
- You're gonna scare somebody!
- What's wrong with you?

956
01:05:03,033 --> 01:05:05,663
Nothing a little coke won't--

957
01:05:05,663 --> 01:05:07,900
- Let's get him to the hospital.
- No!

958
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:09,407
I'll handle it!

959
01:05:09,407 --> 01:05:11,103
Come on. Come on.

960
01:05:11,103 --> 01:05:11,853
OK.

961
01:05:16,616 --> 01:05:18,550
It's safe inside.
It's home.

962
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:20,449
Let's lie down right here.

963
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:23,045
No, come on.
It's safe here.

964
01:05:23,045 --> 01:05:25,057
Come on in, OK?
See?

965
01:05:27,127 --> 01:05:28,059
OK.

966
01:05:29,396 --> 01:05:32,923
OK. See?
You're home.

967
01:05:34,734 --> 01:05:35,484
OK.

968
01:05:38,772 --> 01:05:42,173
- Come on, sweetheart.
-Just let me sleep.

969
01:05:43,176 --> 01:05:44,575
Wait, I got to go.

970
01:05:44,575 --> 01:05:46,578
Rip's looking for me.

971
01:05:46,578 --> 01:05:49,080
Shh.
Just take a deep breath.

972
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:52,414
You can do it.
Go real slow.

973
01:05:52,414 --> 01:05:54,976
- I'm gonna throw up.
- The bucket's under the sink.

974
01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:58,717
Honey, hold on.

975
01:05:58,717 --> 01:06:00,726
OK, baby, hold on.

976
01:06:00,726 --> 01:06:02,261
Just hold on.

977
01:06:21,114 --> 01:06:23,048
OK, hold on.

978
01:06:31,624 --> 01:06:33,558
We're here, baby, OK?

979
01:06:33,558 --> 01:06:36,561
Just stay here
till I'm out, OK?

980
01:06:49,609 --> 01:06:53,568
Who's gonna take care of you guys
when I'm gone?

981
01:06:55,648 --> 01:06:58,082
Come here, baby.
Sit up.

982
01:06:58,082 --> 01:07:01,245
Come on.
Julian, sit up, OK?

983
01:07:26,474 --> 01:07:27,907
Drink this.

984
01:07:27,907 --> 01:07:30,410
It'll stop you
from throwing up.

985
01:08:10,051 --> 01:08:14,488
You don't know what it's been like
with Julian sick all the time.

986
01:08:14,488 --> 01:08:17,820
I'd get so angry,
but it didn't do any good.

987
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:22,329
He'd just promise me he'd get better,
and then he'd start all over again.

988
01:08:22,329 --> 01:08:25,389
Police even came here once
looking for him

989
01:08:25,389 --> 01:08:27,400
and I was here.

990
01:08:29,971 --> 01:08:31,905
I took care of him.

991
01:08:31,905 --> 01:08:34,908
I did the best I could do.

992
01:08:34,908 --> 01:08:38,173
That's what it's been like
while you were gone.

993
01:08:40,982 --> 01:08:43,917
I'll do whatever I can,
whatever it takes.

994
01:09:09,210 --> 01:09:11,144
I'm in the tub.

995
01:09:11,144 --> 01:09:12,645
It's beautiful here.

996
01:09:12,645 --> 01:09:14,648
Five or six people.

997
01:09:14,648 --> 01:09:16,149
Come on up.

998
01:09:16,149 --> 01:09:18,151
I'm not gonna leave.

999
01:09:18,151 --> 01:09:21,120
Let me get back to you.

1000
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,123
Listen, leave Julian alone.

1001
01:09:23,123 --> 01:09:26,786
Well, merry Christmas
to you, too, Clay.

1002
01:09:26,786 --> 01:09:28,294
You heard me.

1003
01:09:28,294 --> 01:09:29,625
You need a hobby.

1004
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:33,326
Bustin' your butt
for Julian is a waste of time.

1005
01:09:33,326 --> 01:09:34,834
I know.

1006
01:09:34,834 --> 01:09:36,836
I'll get the money.

1007
01:09:36,836 --> 01:09:39,031
I'll sell my car,
whatever it takes.

1008
01:09:39,031 --> 01:09:40,472
You've seen Julian recently?

1009
01:09:40,472 --> 01:09:43,442
- You'll get what he owes you.
- You're right. I will.

1010
01:09:43,442 --> 01:09:47,470
And you know something?
It's got nothing to do with you.

1011
01:09:47,470 --> 01:09:49,482
Now, listen to me.

1012
01:09:49,482 --> 01:09:51,984
I am not the problem here.

1013
01:09:51,984 --> 01:09:53,543
Julian is.

1014
01:09:53,543 --> 01:09:54,986
I've been patient.

1015
01:09:54,986 --> 01:09:56,990
I let it slide.

1016
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:59,583
You know how much he owes me?

1017
01:09:59,583 --> 01:10:03,096
Anybody else would have cut him off
a long time ago.

1018
01:10:03,096 --> 01:10:05,098
Julian's dead.
Forget about him.

1019
01:10:05,098 --> 01:10:07,361
I'm telling you that
as a friend.

1020
01:10:07,361 --> 01:10:11,371
I'm not your friend, and I'm tired of
your bullshit. You leave Julian alone.

1021
01:10:11,371 --> 01:10:15,432
Don't deal to him, don't give it to him,
don't fucking go near him.

1022
01:10:15,432 --> 01:10:18,445
I'll get the money.
You just leave him alone, asshole.

1023
01:10:20,314 --> 01:10:23,545
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to, pal?

1024
01:10:31,526 --> 01:10:32,788
Whew!

1025
01:10:34,529 --> 01:10:36,463
How do you feel?

1026
01:10:40,034 --> 01:10:42,969
My head feels like
a frozen pineapple.

1027
01:10:42,969 --> 01:10:45,335
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

1028
01:10:45,335 --> 01:10:47,966
Got a stogy for me?

1029
01:10:47,966 --> 01:10:49,475
Cool.

1030
01:10:53,047 --> 01:10:53,797
Mm.

1031
01:10:58,052 --> 01:10:59,485
Where's Clay?

1032
01:10:59,485 --> 01:11:01,385
He went home.

1033
01:11:01,385 --> 01:11:02,946
Oh, it's Christmas.

1034
01:11:04,158 --> 01:11:05,591
Yeah.

1035
01:11:05,591 --> 01:11:07,423
Merry Christmas.

1036
01:11:11,499 --> 01:11:13,433
It's not gonna
happen again.

1037
01:11:13,433 --> 01:11:14,934
It's over.

1038
01:11:16,671 --> 01:11:19,105
Thank you for
taking care of me.

1039
01:11:20,508 --> 01:11:21,941
Anytime.

1040
01:11:25,012 --> 01:11:26,445
You look great.

1041
01:11:26,445 --> 01:11:27,446
Oh.

1042
01:11:30,318 --> 01:11:32,946
We had fun, didn't we?

1043
01:11:32,946 --> 01:11:36,649
I mean,
some of the time we did.

1044
01:11:42,029 --> 01:11:43,462
Yeah.

1045
01:11:43,462 --> 01:11:44,964
We did.

1046
01:11:47,201 --> 01:11:48,463
Yeah.

1047
01:12:05,486 --> 01:12:06,851
Dad.

1048
01:12:06,851 --> 01:12:08,411
Dad.

1049
01:12:08,411 --> 01:12:11,185
What do you want?

1050
01:12:12,493 --> 01:12:14,427
Just a couple minutes.

1051
01:12:24,505 --> 01:12:26,837
My God, you look terrible.

1052
01:12:28,509 --> 01:12:32,946
I was wondering
if I could stay at home tonight.

1053
01:12:35,116 --> 01:12:38,051
I would love to wake up
and know where I am.

1054
01:12:38,051 --> 01:12:40,644
It'd be a nice change of pace for me.

1055
01:12:42,523 --> 01:12:44,457
I can't do that.

1056
01:12:49,130 --> 01:12:52,896
I wouldn't ask, except that my options
are kind of limited right now.

1057
01:12:52,896 --> 01:12:55,231
Julian, we've been
through this a hundred times.

1058
01:12:55,231 --> 01:12:57,999
No, 101, actually.

1059
01:12:57,999 --> 01:13:00,472
You conned your way through rehab.

1060
01:13:00,472 --> 01:13:02,406
You lied.

1061
01:13:02,406 --> 01:13:04,910
You stole.

1062
01:13:04,910 --> 01:13:06,913
Look what you've done
to our family.

1063
01:13:06,913 --> 01:13:11,918
I just need you to be my father
for one goddamn day

1064
01:13:13,487 --> 01:13:15,421
and just help me.

1065
01:13:20,494 --> 01:13:24,988
Can't you tell when
I'm telling the truth?

1066
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:27,250
No.

1067
01:13:28,169 --> 01:13:31,434
Trust was the first thing
you ruined.

1068
01:13:37,011 --> 01:13:38,444
Yeah.

1069
01:13:45,019 --> 01:13:46,953
OK, I'm gonna go.

1070
01:13:46,953 --> 01:13:50,149
There's this guy I owe
a large sum of money to.

1071
01:13:50,149 --> 01:13:54,957
I know that's a big surprise,
but I'm gonna try to work it out.

1072
01:13:54,957 --> 01:13:58,965
I'm gonna try to do something
right for once. I mean it.

1073
01:14:00,768 --> 01:14:04,898
I just want you to wish me luck,
whether you believe me or not.

1074
01:14:08,075 --> 01:14:09,406
Julian.

1075
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:16,848
Can you stay clean
for one week?

1076
01:14:18,486 --> 01:14:20,420
For one damn week?

1077
01:14:21,989 --> 01:14:24,924
I'll do everything
I can to help you,

1078
01:14:24,924 --> 01:14:27,927
but I need you
to help me, too.

1079
01:14:29,497 --> 01:14:31,431
I could try.

1080
01:15:31,385 --> 01:15:33,319
You all right?

1081
01:15:33,319 --> 01:15:35,321
I just got here.

1082
01:15:36,891 --> 01:15:38,324
Rip did this.

1083
01:15:51,305 --> 01:15:53,068
<i>Blair, it's Markie.</i>

1084
01:15:53,068 --> 01:15:56,735
<i>Just checking to see if
you need a ride to the Springs.</i>

1085
01:15:56,735 --> 01:15:59,336
<i>See you at Trends. Bye.</i>

1086
01:15:59,336 --> 01:16:00,846
<i>[Beep]</i>

1087
01:16:00,846 --> 01:16:02,280
<i>Hi, it's Julian.</i>

1088
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:06,946
<i>I'm gonna talk to Rip,
settle some business--</i>

1089
01:16:06,946 --> 01:16:10,889
<i>Better late than never, right?
Anyway, I'm outta here.</i>

1090
01:16:10,889 --> 01:16:13,620
<i>Merry Christmas,
and thank you for last night.</i>

1091
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:16,185
<i>Both of you.
I mean it. Bye.</i>

1092
01:16:16,185 --> 01:16:17,696
<i>[Beep]</i>

1093
01:16:37,385 --> 01:16:39,319
What are we gonna do?

1094
01:16:39,319 --> 01:16:41,685
Find him.
Bring him back.

1095
01:16:41,685 --> 01:16:43,815
It won't make any difference.

1096
01:16:43,815 --> 01:16:46,325
He'll just start all over again.

1097
01:16:46,325 --> 01:16:48,328
Not if he leaves.

1098
01:16:48,328 --> 01:16:51,331
Julian would be better off
somewhere else.

1099
01:16:51,331 --> 01:16:53,367
I'll take him with me
if I have to.

1100
01:17:16,357 --> 01:17:18,291
Don't look so surly.

1101
01:17:20,361 --> 01:17:22,295
Julian's in the back.

1102
01:17:22,295 --> 01:17:24,797
How you doing?
You look great.

1103
01:17:24,797 --> 01:17:26,230
Welcome.

1104
01:17:26,230 --> 01:17:28,291
It's been a long time.

1105
01:17:36,377 --> 01:17:38,368
Hello, Julian.

1106
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:40,312
Hi.

1107
01:17:40,312 --> 01:17:42,747
I missed you.

1108
01:17:42,747 --> 01:17:44,307
Mmm.

1109
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:55,824
- I got to talk to you.
- Sure.

1110
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:01,333
Have a seat.

1111
01:18:02,670 --> 01:18:06,106
OK, just for a minute.
I gotta get back into town.

1112
01:18:10,344 --> 01:18:12,869
Basically, uh--

1113
01:18:12,869 --> 01:18:17,577
It's over. I'm quitting.
I'm not gonna work for you anymore.

1114
01:18:17,577 --> 01:18:19,915
I'm not buying.

1115
01:18:19,915 --> 01:18:23,286
I'm gonna clean up.
I'm probably going back into rehab.

1116
01:18:23,286 --> 01:18:26,952
I'm just gonna get
my life under control.

1117
01:18:29,864 --> 01:18:33,527
Julian, who the fuck do you
think you're talking to?

1118
01:18:33,527 --> 01:18:35,796
You're a junkie.

1119
01:18:35,796 --> 01:18:37,303
You're not gonna quit.

1120
01:18:37,303 --> 01:18:39,805
- I'll get your money back.
- When?

1121
01:18:39,805 --> 01:18:42,900
I don't know. I'm talking to my dad.
I'm gonna work it out.

1122
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:45,605
I just know I can.

1123
01:18:45,605 --> 01:18:47,647
You look so sincere
when you say that,

1124
01:18:47,647 --> 01:18:49,649
but I've heard
all this before.

1125
01:18:49,649 --> 01:18:52,185
What are you telling me
that's new?

1126
01:18:52,185 --> 01:18:54,050
Julian, make an effort.

1127
01:18:54,050 --> 01:18:56,055
Give me a new excuse, at least.

1128
01:18:56,055 --> 01:18:58,057
I've heard this shit before!

1129
01:18:58,057 --> 01:19:01,652
The difference is
that I mean it this time.

1130
01:19:01,652 --> 01:19:02,821
Good.

1131
01:19:07,468 --> 01:19:09,402
Are you ready to
work for me tonight?

1132
01:19:09,402 --> 01:19:10,801
No, I'm not.

1133
01:19:12,907 --> 01:19:14,841
Julian, where you been hiding?

1134
01:19:14,841 --> 01:19:18,345
Rip, how long have
we known each other?

1135
01:19:18,345 --> 01:19:20,972
We've been friends.

1136
01:19:20,972 --> 01:19:23,346
Yes, we are friends,
aren't we, Julian?

1137
01:19:23,346 --> 01:19:25,351
Yeah.
For a long time.

1138
01:19:25,351 --> 01:19:28,855
Please don't make me do this.
I can't do it again.

1139
01:19:30,558 --> 01:19:34,358
I think you'd be surprised
at what you can do, Julian.

1140
01:20:08,395 --> 01:20:11,330
I'll be back in a few seconds.

1141
01:20:19,707 --> 01:20:23,734
# Let's swim to the moon, uh-huh #

1142
01:20:23,734 --> 01:20:26,837
# Let's glide to the tide #

1143
01:20:26,837 --> 01:20:28,848
That's a really cool tux.

1144
01:20:28,848 --> 01:20:30,850
Yeah!
Where'd you get it?

1145
01:20:30,850 --> 01:20:32,852
- Your dad?
- My mother!

1146
01:20:32,852 --> 01:20:34,683
- Hey, guys.
- Clay!

1147
01:20:34,683 --> 01:20:37,155
- Have you seen Julian?
- Not yet.

1148
01:20:37,155 --> 01:20:39,658
- How about Rip?
- He's probably at the hotel.

1149
01:20:39,658 --> 01:20:41,957
- What?
- He's got a suite.

1150
01:20:41,957 --> 01:20:44,657
- Where?
- Laurel Palms.

1151
01:20:44,657 --> 01:20:47,064
All right, thanks.
I'll see you later.

1152
01:20:47,064 --> 01:20:50,069
# ...River on a #

1153
01:20:50,069 --> 01:20:53,368
# Moonlight drive #

1154
01:21:06,887 --> 01:21:11,324
Rip is over at the Laurel Palms.
Julian might be there.

1155
01:21:11,324 --> 01:21:12,825
I hope not.

1156
01:21:12,825 --> 01:21:14,827
Stay here.
I'll be back.

1157
01:21:14,827 --> 01:21:16,328
Be careful.

1158
01:21:16,328 --> 01:21:17,830
I love you.

1159
01:21:17,830 --> 01:21:22,096
# Let's swim to the moon #

1160
01:21:22,096 --> 01:21:26,435
# Let's glide to the tide ##

1161
01:21:26,435 --> 01:21:30,238
USC won't let him in because
he's a heroin addict.

1162
01:21:30,238 --> 01:21:34,042
Blair, where's your tux?

1163
01:21:34,042 --> 01:21:36,207
Oh, we just drove out.

1164
01:21:36,207 --> 01:21:40,344
- I don't know these people.
- Maybe they're from Palm Springs.

1165
01:21:40,344 --> 01:21:42,355
Nobody's from Palm Springs.

1166
01:21:42,355 --> 01:21:44,755
Frank Sinatra.

1167
01:21:46,193 --> 01:21:47,660
Oh, darn.

1168
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:50,128
The party was
better last year.

1169
01:21:50,128 --> 01:21:51,630
Kim, here.

1170
01:21:51,630 --> 01:21:54,634
I think it was
exactly the same.

1171
01:21:54,634 --> 01:21:57,068
Rusty pipes.

1172
01:22:44,129 --> 01:22:45,061
Hi.

1173
01:23:01,646 --> 01:23:03,011
Ohhh.

1174
01:23:03,011 --> 01:23:05,015
Hey, what is this?

1175
01:23:05,015 --> 01:23:07,517
I thought this was all cool.

1176
01:23:07,517 --> 01:23:08,517
Hey.

1177
01:23:11,089 --> 01:23:13,523
Who the hell are you, man?

1178
01:24:08,146 --> 01:24:11,081
Make me understand, Julian.
I really want to understand.

1179
01:24:11,081 --> 01:24:13,049
No, you don't.

1180
01:24:14,986 --> 01:24:18,922
- You look like a fuckin' whore.
- Rip made me do that. I had no choice.

1181
01:24:18,922 --> 01:24:22,016
Shit, man, you did it to yourself!.

1182
01:24:22,016 --> 01:24:23,526
Fuckin' run away.

1183
01:24:23,526 --> 01:24:26,029
That's what you're really good at.

1184
01:24:26,029 --> 01:24:28,031
I'm not coming after you.

1185
01:24:28,031 --> 01:24:31,091
- You don't know!
- Well, tell me!

1186
01:24:31,091 --> 01:24:33,399
- Forget it!
- Get in the car.

1187
01:24:33,399 --> 01:24:36,440
- Leave me alone.
- Are you gonna go back to Rip? Hide?

1188
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:39,806
- I wanna know what you're gonna do now.
- I don't know!

1189
01:24:39,806 --> 01:24:43,278
Come with me. Leave with me.
I'll take you back to school.

1190
01:24:43,278 --> 01:24:45,282
There's no reason to stay in L.A.

1191
01:24:45,282 --> 01:24:48,683
- It's over. Let's go.
- Do I look like I'm ready for homework?

1192
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:12,500
# How low can you go? #

1193
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:13,250
Hi.

1194
01:25:25,089 --> 01:25:26,522
Hey!

1195
01:25:30,595 --> 01:25:32,028
What a waste.

1196
01:25:32,028 --> 01:25:34,030
Oh, man, what a waste!

1197
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:36,032
Well, call a plumber.

1198
01:25:40,605 --> 01:25:42,539
Nice ride there.

1199
01:25:42,539 --> 01:25:45,542
Yeah, it is nice.

1200
01:25:45,542 --> 01:25:47,043
You all right?

1201
01:25:47,043 --> 01:25:49,045
I'll be right back.

1202
01:25:49,045 --> 01:25:51,047
Just wait here, OK?

1203
01:25:53,618 --> 01:25:55,552
I'll be one minute, OK?

1204
01:26:11,069 --> 01:26:12,502
# I can't get your love #

1205
01:26:12,502 --> 01:26:14,504
# I can't get attraction #

1206
01:26:17,075 --> 01:26:21,034
# I only get a little
psychotic reaction #

1207
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:25,506
- Did you find him?
- Yeah, he's in the car.

1208
01:26:28,519 --> 01:26:31,545
You don't have a clue
what you're getting into.

1209
01:26:31,545 --> 01:26:35,524
This is not recess, and I'm sick
of playing fucking games with you.

1210
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:37,527
Everyone is accountable!

1211
01:26:37,527 --> 01:26:41,031
Now tell me where the fuck Julian is
so I can get back to business.

1212
01:26:41,031 --> 01:26:44,034
- Is that what you call it?
- Where is he?

1213
01:26:44,034 --> 01:26:46,263
Why don't you
just leave us alone?

1214
01:26:46,263 --> 01:26:48,464
Why don't I check the car?

1215
01:26:51,008 --> 01:26:52,032
Bitch!

1216
01:26:56,814 --> 01:26:58,873
Stop! Leave him alone!

1217
01:26:58,873 --> 01:27:00,747
Stay out of it!

1218
01:27:03,121 --> 01:27:04,554
Clay, come on!

1219
01:27:06,157 --> 01:27:07,488
No!

1220
01:27:19,003 --> 01:27:20,994
Come on! Come on!

1221
01:27:25,076 --> 01:27:26,008
Clay!

1222
01:27:26,008 --> 01:27:27,510
I'm all right.

1223
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:30,513
Wow!
What a party.

1224
01:27:30,513 --> 01:27:33,015
You have enough gas
to get to college?

1225
01:27:33,015 --> 01:27:34,517
Ha ha ha!

1226
01:27:34,517 --> 01:27:36,519
I love you guys!

1227
01:28:21,065 --> 01:28:22,430
Julian?

1228
01:28:24,569 --> 01:28:26,503
I'm all right.

1229
01:28:26,503 --> 01:28:30,507
I just got this uncontrollable urge
to fall down.

1230
01:28:30,507 --> 01:28:33,510
Oh, let's walk with one another.

1231
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:37,309
I just want you to know
that I know how much you've helped me.

1232
01:28:37,309 --> 01:28:40,009
You've helped me
when I didn't deserve help.

1233
01:28:40,009 --> 01:28:43,019
You've been so kind to me,
no matter how much I keep fucking up.

1234
01:28:43,019 --> 01:28:47,353
This is why I'm going
to make it up to you for everything.

1235
01:28:47,353 --> 01:28:50,519
I'm going to deserve
your friendship.

1236
01:28:50,519 --> 01:28:53,530
That's it. I wanted you
to hear it from me.

1237
01:28:53,530 --> 01:28:58,535
I want you to stop me before I say
something grotesquely sentimental.

1238
01:28:58,535 --> 01:29:00,537
You need a doctor.

1239
01:29:00,537 --> 01:29:03,073
No, I don't.
I just need to get outta here.

1240
01:29:03,073 --> 01:29:05,540
A couple hours sleep,
I'll be a new me.

1241
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:07,043
You're sure?

1242
01:29:07,043 --> 01:29:08,544
Yeah.

1243
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:01,493
Julian.

1244
01:30:01,493 --> 01:30:02,927
Come on.

1245
01:30:04,598 --> 01:30:05,929
Jul--

1246
01:30:09,002 --> 01:30:10,435
Julian.

1247
01:30:29,990 --> 01:30:31,958
- Don't, man--
- What?

1248
01:30:42,536 --> 01:30:43,286
No.

1249
01:30:51,545 --> 01:30:52,295
No.

1250
01:31:07,728 --> 01:31:08,478
No.

1251
01:31:11,999 --> 01:31:14,832
Oh, my God.

1252
01:31:14,832 --> 01:31:17,928
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

1253
01:31:34,021 --> 01:31:35,955
I'm sorry.

1254
01:31:38,025 --> 01:31:38,775
No.

1255
01:31:51,538 --> 01:31:53,472
Oh, my God.

1256
01:33:04,478 --> 01:33:08,414
I remember, Julian’s mother
died when we were 5,

1257
01:33:08,414 --> 01:33:11,417
and it was awful.

1258
01:33:11,417 --> 01:33:14,420
Julian didn't cry,
though, or nothin'.

1259
01:33:14,420 --> 01:33:19,892
He just sat by the phone because
his mom used to call him every day

1260
01:33:19,892 --> 01:33:21,928
when she was away on business.

1261
01:33:23,997 --> 01:33:27,933
Nobody could get Julian
away from the telephone.

1262
01:33:27,933 --> 01:33:31,095
Mr. Wells, he called all our parents,
but nothing worked.

1263
01:33:31,095 --> 01:33:34,834
So one day, Mr. Wells,
he sent Julian a telegram

1264
01:33:34,834 --> 01:33:37,240
like it was from his mother,

1265
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:40,973
saying that she had died
and gone to heaven.

1266
01:33:43,350 --> 01:33:46,547
I remember Julian
showing it to me.

1267
01:33:46,547 --> 01:33:49,748
He carried it
around for a year,

1268
01:33:49,748 --> 01:33:51,450
and he was OK.

1269
01:33:56,029 --> 01:33:58,463
He was a tough little kid.

1270
01:34:03,970 --> 01:34:05,904
I don't know.

1271
01:34:05,904 --> 01:34:06,961
I did everything

1272
01:34:06,961 --> 01:34:10,100
that I could do.

1273
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:10,820
Ohh...

1274
01:34:12,546 --> 01:34:14,912
I'm going to miss him so much.

1275
01:34:21,254 --> 01:34:23,415
Well, I'm going away tomorrow,

1276
01:34:23,415 --> 01:34:27,426
and I want you
to come with me.

1277
01:34:27,426 --> 01:34:28,176
OK?

1278
01:34:29,763 --> 01:34:32,926
Yes, I want to go with you.

1279
01:34:32,926 --> 01:34:34,432
I do.

1280
01:34:36,870 --> 01:34:38,929
- I want to.
- Good.

1281
01:34:41,675 --> 01:34:46,772
# My time has come,
the clouds are calling #

1282
01:34:46,772 --> 01:34:51,944
# December wind
has come my way #

1283
01:34:51,944 --> 01:34:56,387
#And now I feel
the world falling #

1284
01:34:56,387 --> 01:34:58,788
#All at once #

1285
01:34:58,788 --> 01:35:00,952
# It's too late #

1286
01:35:00,952 --> 01:35:02,662
# Life fades away #

1287
01:35:02,662 --> 01:35:04,297
# Life fades away #

1288
01:35:05,802 --> 01:35:09,397
#The night is my way #

1289
01:35:12,909 --> 01:35:16,845
#All thoughts slip away #

1290
01:35:16,845 --> 01:35:21,350
#And even though
I must leave you #

1291
01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:26,616
# Remember I love you #

1292
01:35:26,616 --> 01:35:27,516
# I'll always be #

1293
01:35:31,594 --> 01:35:32,494
# In your memory #

1294
01:35:37,433 --> 01:35:42,200
# I will always
be with you #

1295
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:46,038
#When I am gone #

1296
01:35:48,545 --> 01:35:49,795
# Babe, life fades away #

1297
01:35:57,453 --> 01:36:01,822
# Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah #

1298
