What happened?

43
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:13,391
She got stuck.

All right, let's
get this thing moving.

00:03:35,367 --> 00:03:37,210
I don't give a fuck.
Fuck that bitch.

48
00:03:37,286 --> 00:03:39,209
She freak out?

49
00:03:39,288 --> 00:03:41,336
Yeah. Is there anything
more unflattering

50
00:03:41,415 --> 00:03:43,338
than patterns on hotel rooms?

51
00:03:45,544 --> 00:03:49,048
- I know.
- Why can't they just use solid colors?

52
00:03:49,131 --> 00:03:51,725
It's easier to hide the stains.

53
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,552
That's so right.

54
00:03:56,096 --> 00:03:58,349
We gotta get that
fucker on the stand.

55
00:04:06,523 --> 00:04:08,946
Oh. What are you waiting for?

56
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,783
Hi, Mike.

57
00:04:12,863 --> 00:04:15,662
Don't you know what time it is?

58
00:04:15,741 --> 00:04:20,372
The Fire chief is responsible for all decisions
made from the Fire department, right?

59
00:04:20,454 --> 00:04:23,253
Uh, for the most part, yeah.

60
00:04:23,332 --> 00:04:26,051
If the chief of the fire department
was deleting work orders

61
00:04:26,126 --> 00:04:30,848
which directly resulted in sending non-working
trucks to a fire, that's his fault?

62
00:04:30,923 --> 00:04:33,346
Yeah, I guess
you could say that.

63
00:04:33,425 --> 00:04:36,178
Then it's all bullshit
they fired a guy for falsifying his resume.

64
00:04:36,261 --> 00:04:38,684
It's 'cause he exposed
the work orders.

65
00:04:38,764 --> 00:04:40,812
It's a little late to change
our tactic, isn't it?

66
00:04:40,891 --> 00:04:43,360
He was wrapped up in the price
of repairs but it didn't matter

67
00:04:43,435 --> 00:04:45,233
because they were never
gonna do the repairs.

68
00:04:45,312 --> 00:04:46,905
Hey, shut the fuck up.

69
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,278
Mike, where are you?

70
00:04:49,358 --> 00:04:51,201
Just hanging out
with some friends.

71
00:04:51,276 --> 00:04:53,904
You know what? You get some sleep.
I got this, okay?

72
00:04:53,987 --> 00:04:55,660
Bye!

73
00:04:59,368 --> 00:05:01,086
Hi.

74
00:05:12,798 --> 00:05:14,015
Are you still sleeping?

75
00:05:14,091 --> 00:05:15,263
Yes.

76
00:05:16,844 --> 00:05:20,098
Ah.

77
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,558
You're joining the jury.
The reason my client is fired

78
00:05:22,641 --> 00:05:24,439
was because he
falsified his resume,

79
00:05:24,518 --> 00:05:26,987
not because he went
above your head

80
00:05:27,062 --> 00:05:30,612
and reported that trucks were not getting
fixed and people were dying as a result.

81
00:05:30,691 --> 00:05:32,614
Say yes.

82
00:05:32,693 --> 00:05:34,616
Yes.

83
00:05:34,695 --> 00:05:37,448
You also said you only went
to review my client's resume

84
00:05:37,531 --> 00:05:41,581
after he went to the media.
Correct?

85
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,506
On May 9th, a truck went to the house of
Alex Foreman with a broken wafer pump.

86
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:47,754
That resulted in Mr.
Foreman burning to death.

87
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,712
On June 17th, another truck went
to the house of Crystal Dougan

88
00:05:50,794 --> 00:05:52,512
also with a non-working pump,

89
00:05:52,588 --> 00:05:55,512
also resulting in Ms.
Dougan burning to death.

90
00:05:55,591 --> 00:05:57,138
Is that true?

91
00:05:57,217 --> 00:05:58,719
It is.

92
00:05:58,802 --> 00:06:00,896
No shit? Damn.

93
00:06:00,971 --> 00:06:03,724
He knew he sent non-working
fire trucks to houses on fire?

94
00:06:03,807 --> 00:06:06,026
He says he didn't.

95
00:06:06,101 --> 00:06:09,105
You said the trucks were broken
because the work orders were deleted.

96
00:06:09,187 --> 00:06:12,111
The work order could be anything.
It could be a tire alignment,

97
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,409
it could be a tear in the
fucking seat fabric.

98
00:06:14,484 --> 00:06:16,782
But it wasn't a tear
in the fucking seat fabric.

99
00:06:16,862 --> 00:06:18,956
The damn pumps
wouldn't work, right?

100
00:06:22,576 --> 00:06:24,544
So, if the work orders
had been deleted

101
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,123
and you didn't know the
trucks needed to be fixed,

102
00:06:27,205 --> 00:06:30,049
they were never gonna be
repaired to begin with.

103
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:33,755
After you realized the paperwork system
for the work orders were so screwed up

104
00:06:33,837 --> 00:06:36,010
that you accidentally
approved two fire trucks

105
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:39,389
that didn't actually have
working water pumps,

106
00:06:39,468 --> 00:06:41,516
realizing this,
because my client

107
00:06:41,595 --> 00:06:44,769
exposed the fire department's
bureaucratic mess to the public,

108
00:06:44,848 --> 00:06:49,604
after you realized this, you
felt the best usage of your time

109
00:06:49,686 --> 00:06:52,064
would not be to go back
and fix the system

110
00:06:52,147 --> 00:06:55,071
in an effort to prevent the
death of more innocent people.

111
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,198
You thought the first
thing you should do

112
00:06:57,277 --> 00:07:00,076
was looking to my client's
job application and resume

113
00:07:00,155 --> 00:07:03,876
even though he'd already been working
for the department for four years.

114
00:07:03,951 --> 00:07:06,420
That may be what it looks like.

115
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:10,875
I'm sorry, sir, it's a simple question.
Which did you look into first?

116
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,552
The work order system that
had just caused the death

117
00:07:13,627 --> 00:07:15,550
of two innocent people,

118
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:19,054
or a four-year-old job
application of an employee

119
00:07:19,132 --> 00:07:22,056
that had just publicly
humiliated you?

120
00:07:22,135 --> 00:07:26,015
And I remind your, sir,
that you're under oath.

121
00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:29,693
I guess that the
application was first.

122
00:07:32,562 --> 00:07:34,485
No further questions,
Your Honor.

123
00:07:40,946 --> 00:07:44,291
Have you or someone you love
been injured in an accident

124
00:07:44,366 --> 00:07:47,586
due to the negligence
of another person?

125
00:07:47,661 --> 00:07:51,291
Call Danzinger and Weiss.
The phone call is free

126
00:07:51,373 --> 00:07:53,717
and so is the consultation.

127
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:56,887
You need professional,
experienced trial lawyers

128
00:07:56,962 --> 00:07:59,260
that care about their clients

129
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:03,264
to get the cash settlements that
you and your family deserve.

130
00:08:03,343 --> 00:08:07,018
Don't wait. Call today.

131
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:10,859
Are you serious?

132
00:08:10,934 --> 00:08:14,188
The fact is that auto accidents

133
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:17,320
and negligence result in
higher personal injury awards

134
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:21,199
and higher jury awards.
90% of them never even see the court room.

135
00:08:21,278 --> 00:08:23,622
You should really
take me serious.

136
00:08:23,697 --> 00:08:26,120
You should have a drink, counselor.
We're celebrating.

137
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:28,452
I remind you that we
would've made more money

138
00:08:28,535 --> 00:08:30,663
if we had settled today's
case before the trial.

139
00:08:30,746 --> 00:08:32,419
Should I remind you
that we won?

140
00:08:36,084 --> 00:08:37,961
Oh, damn.

141
00:08:38,045 --> 00:08:41,174
We won't stay long.
Like five minutes, okay?

142
00:08:42,424 --> 00:08:43,926
Oh, no, thanks.

143
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:45,386
Have you seen my husband?

144
00:08:45,469 --> 00:08:46,891
Oh, no.

145
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:54,938
Beer, tequila, Jack, rum?

146
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,567
Fine.

147
00:08:59,524 --> 00:09:01,743
Mike 's my legal aide.

148
00:09:01,818 --> 00:09:04,116
Please, tell me you're joking.

149
00:09:04,196 --> 00:09:06,164
Uh, no.

150
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:08,913
He really hasn't changed
since eighth grade, has he?

151
00:09:08,992 --> 00:09:10,539
No, he hasn't.

152
00:09:10,619 --> 00:09:12,713
Have you seen
my fucking husband?

153
00:09:12,788 --> 00:09:15,587
I think he might be out back.

154
00:09:15,665 --> 00:09:20,011
I haven't ever heard of a goddamn
coaster, you fucking animal!

155
00:09:21,838 --> 00:09:24,512
Can we go now?

156
00:09:24,591 --> 00:09:26,844
How did you get to teach your
class tonight, by the way?

157
00:09:26,927 --> 00:09:29,225
I didn't.

158
00:09:29,304 --> 00:09:32,558
You can't keep canceling your class.
The students have been complaining.

159
00:09:32,641 --> 00:09:35,269
Why? They're all here.

160
00:09:35,352 --> 00:09:39,698
Oh. And the lady, she's still waiting on
those articles on the transportation.

161
00:09:39,773 --> 00:09:43,277
Jesus Christ, you're worse than all legal acts.
No more talk about work.

162
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,829
Everybody, no more talk about work.
This is a party.

163
00:09:45,904 --> 00:09:47,577
It's an interesting
party, too, Mike.

164
00:09:47,656 --> 00:09:49,533
Hey, what's going on?

165
00:09:49,616 --> 00:09:52,085
Hey. What the fuck is that?

166
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,753
It's an alligator.

167
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:56,423
It's just left outside,
walk around.

168
00:10:03,004 --> 00:10:05,382
Hey, listen, guys.

169
00:10:05,465 --> 00:10:07,718
I can't keep having
my firm give you work

170
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:10,179
is gonna take
you twice as long...

171
00:10:10,262 --> 00:10:13,516
Twice as long to find the 1994 case
of Kings County vs. Stevenson

172
00:10:13,598 --> 00:10:17,228
which protects the rights of people
with disabilities to keep their pets,

173
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:20,985
including animals used for emotional
support in cases like depression.

174
00:10:21,064 --> 00:10:22,737
Regardless of the
landlord's policy

175
00:10:22,816 --> 00:10:25,194
making the eviction of
your client illegal,

176
00:10:25,277 --> 00:10:28,497
and upping the value of what will
now be a really nice settlement.

177
00:10:28,572 --> 00:10:32,167
You're welcome.
I'll have it for you by Monday.

178
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:35,996
Thank you.

179
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,548
You guys are gonna go see
that nurse tomorrow, right?

180
00:10:38,623 --> 00:10:40,421
Yeah.

181
00:10:41,668 --> 00:10:43,090
All right. I gotta go.

182
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,797
What do you mean you gotta go?

183
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,757
I can't stay.
Rita's in the car right now.

184
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,638
Your lizard tried
to bite her foot.

185
00:10:48,717 --> 00:10:50,560
Was she wearing white shoes?
He hates those.

186
00:10:50,635 --> 00:10:52,603
Don't go. You just got here.

187
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:54,898
I got a white supremacist I
want you to straighten out.

188
00:10:54,973 --> 00:10:56,600
Are you serious?

189
00:10:56,683 --> 00:10:59,106
It'd be a great conversation.

190
00:10:59,186 --> 00:11:02,690
Jamie, what the fuck? Are you nuts?
There are people upstairs.

191
00:11:02,772 --> 00:11:06,447
In our bed, in our fucking
bed, you asshole!

192
00:11:06,526 --> 00:11:09,951
Jamie, we should talk about
this, but this is not the way.

193
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:13,455
Apologize.

194
00:11:15,243 --> 00:11:16,961
Apologize!

195
00:11:17,037 --> 00:11:19,790
♪ We are the same ♪

196
00:11:19,873 --> 00:11:22,376
I'm sorry.

197
00:11:24,878 --> 00:11:26,721
I want a divorce.

198
00:11:26,796 --> 00:11:29,396
♪ We are the same ♪

199
00:11:35,764 --> 00:11:37,562
I'll see ya.

200
00:11:42,312 --> 00:11:44,531
All right, everyone,
drama's over.

201
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:46,741
Fuck.

202
00:11:52,906 --> 00:11:55,204
Why do you still have
this piece of crap?

203
00:11:55,283 --> 00:11:57,581
I love this car.
You can drive it.

204
00:12:00,497 --> 00:12:03,501
That drink smells
like wide open ass.

205
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,462
Good for the body,
good for the soul.

206
00:12:06,544 --> 00:12:08,171
Mr. Health Nut.

207
00:12:08,255 --> 00:12:10,303
You treat your digestive
tract like a sewer.

208
00:12:10,382 --> 00:12:14,182
All that soda is gonna
destroy your esophagus.

209
00:12:28,942 --> 00:12:30,910
So, did you get your gun back?

210
00:12:32,612 --> 00:12:34,034
Not yet.

211
00:12:34,114 --> 00:12:35,661
You all right?

212
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,492
She'll be back soon.

213
00:12:43,206 --> 00:12:47,052
So, after I got
over myself a bit, I decided to fight.

214
00:12:47,127 --> 00:12:49,050
Oh, thank you, sweetie.

215
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:54,226
I mean, AIDS isn't a
death sentence any more.

216
00:12:54,301 --> 00:12:57,555
And the medicine gets better
and better every year.

217
00:12:57,637 --> 00:12:59,389
Oh, sure, yes, of course.

218
00:12:59,472 --> 00:13:00,724
This is all we had.

219
00:13:00,807 --> 00:13:02,434
David, a glass?

220
00:13:02,517 --> 00:13:05,066
That's fine. We're okay.
Thank you, David.

221
00:13:05,145 --> 00:13:06,988
Can I play with Mr. Deedles?

222
00:13:07,063 --> 00:13:08,986
Of course, hon. Of course.

223
00:13:11,443 --> 00:13:16,574
Anyway, Daryl said if anybody
could help, it'd be you fellas.

224
00:13:16,656 --> 00:13:20,331
My friend Jeffrey invented
this after my accident.

225
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,755
It's a safety needle.

226
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,253
Can't prick yourself,
can't be reused.

227
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:30,463
A safety needle like this could prevent
incidents like mine from ever happening.

228
00:13:30,545 --> 00:13:32,764
And the hospital refuses
to even look at if.

229
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,888
Excuse me, so you were
injured on the job,

230
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:38,311
but are you receiving
worker's compensation?

231
00:13:38,386 --> 00:13:40,434
Yes, they've kept up
with that end of it.

232
00:13:40,513 --> 00:13:42,891
Uh, unfortunately

233
00:13:42,974 --> 00:13:45,352
I don't think there's anything
else that can be done.

234
00:13:45,435 --> 00:13:48,359
That's all of the law
provides for and, uh...

235
00:13:48,438 --> 00:13:50,657
It's really all we can get you.

236
00:13:50,732 --> 00:13:52,905
But I-I don't want
anything else.

237
00:13:52,984 --> 00:13:57,581
Not personally anyway.
You see, my case is not an isolated incident.

238
00:13:57,655 --> 00:14:01,660
This thing is happening to front line
health care professionals all the time.

239
00:14:01,743 --> 00:14:03,586
We 're very sorry.

240
00:14:03,661 --> 00:14:06,039
We have to make them use this.
The bottom line is,

241
00:14:06,122 --> 00:14:09,626
the hospitals are knowing they're
putting their employees at risk

242
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:13,930
letting them get hurt.
People are dying.

243
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:21,221
And then
again I feel this tap.

244
00:14:21,304 --> 00:14:23,227
More like a late dump.

245
00:14:25,058 --> 00:14:26,560
it's a babe.

246
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:40,744
What I'm saying is we've
been netting on average

247
00:14:40,824 --> 00:14:43,748
for each injury settlement
about 50 to 20 K, right?

248
00:14:43,827 --> 00:14:45,670
Keep stringing a few
of these together a month

249
00:14:45,745 --> 00:14:47,668
and we can actually be in
the black by February.

250
00:14:47,747 --> 00:14:49,920
How often do you think that
needle stick thing happens?

251
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:51,626
You think it's
like a daily thing?

252
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:55,009
I don't know.
There's no case here anyway.

253
00:14:55,088 --> 00:14:57,386
If we could prove the
hospitals were negligent,

254
00:14:57,465 --> 00:15:00,435
our clients could be every
hospital worker in the country.

255
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,605
Mike, we can't afford to go on a
fishing expedition right now.

256
00:15:05,765 --> 00:15:07,483
I think we should
go meet that guy.

257
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:09,653
The guy that invented
the safety needle.

258
00:15:18,236 --> 00:15:20,705
If you come with me to
meet Jeffrey the inventor,

259
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,453
I'll give you three
focused days.

260
00:15:22,532 --> 00:15:24,910
Three extremely focused,
eight-hour days,

261
00:15:24,993 --> 00:15:28,918
interviewing as many accident victims
trying to squeeze the insurance company

262
00:15:28,997 --> 00:15:33,298
for an extra $12
as you want. Deal?

263
00:15:33,376 --> 00:15:35,378
Deal.

264
00:15:56,232 --> 00:15:57,905
Give me that clamp.

265
00:15:57,984 --> 00:15:59,907
Jeffrey Dancort.

266
00:15:59,986 --> 00:16:01,909
That's me.

267
00:16:01,988 --> 00:16:04,912
Paul Danzinger.
We're lawyers from Danzinger and Weiss.

268
00:16:06,576 --> 00:16:08,499
He a lawyer, too?

269
00:16:08,578 --> 00:16:10,501
This is Mike Weiss, my partner.

270
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:19,093
I was working as a mechanical and
structural engineer when Vicky got stuck.

271
00:16:19,172 --> 00:16:21,174
So, you guys met her?

272
00:16:21,257 --> 00:16:23,430
Uh, yeah, we did.
It's a terrible shame.

273
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:26,514
She's my best friend 's kid.
That really hit me.

274
00:16:26,596 --> 00:16:29,770
I spent about a year working
on developing the concept.

275
00:16:29,849 --> 00:16:33,570
Sooner or later the National Institute
of Health gave me a $50,000-grant

276
00:16:33,645 --> 00:16:36,524
to develop a prototype
for reproduction.

277
00:16:36,606 --> 00:16:38,483
Anyone ever use it?

278
00:16:38,566 --> 00:16:40,944
San Antonio Memorial Hospital
used it for two years.

279
00:16:41,027 --> 00:16:42,779
How's that working out?

280
00:16:42,862 --> 00:16:45,536
Not a single needle stick
incident in two years.

281
00:16:45,615 --> 00:16:48,289
So, there's no way you can
get stuck with this thing.

282
00:16:48,368 --> 00:16:50,587
Can't get stuck with it,
can't reuse it.

283
00:16:50,662 --> 00:16:54,166
Doctor's love it and
nurses are begging for it.

284
00:16:54,249 --> 00:16:56,798
Only San Antonio
Memorial will buy it.

285
00:16:56,876 --> 00:16:59,174
Why?

286
00:16:59,254 --> 00:17:01,882
I thought you guys
could tell me that.

287
00:17:01,965 --> 00:17:06,141
To start you should call at least 200
hospitals over the next couple of weeks.

288
00:17:06,219 --> 00:17:08,722
Two hundred hospitals.

289
00:17:08,805 --> 00:17:11,729
I know it sounds a lot, but we 're
gonna need to do is get a data base...

290
00:17:11,808 --> 00:17:13,651
I've already approached
2,000 hospitals.

291
00:17:13,726 --> 00:17:15,945
What'd say when you
showed them the needle?

292
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,364
They asked me to leave.

293
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:21,113
Is there any way we can sue a
hospital for not buying something

294
00:17:21,192 --> 00:17:23,866
that saves people's lives?

295
00:18:00,898 --> 00:18:05,825
So called miracle drug allegedly
causes client to suffer a stroke.

296
00:18:05,903 --> 00:18:10,374
He's currently waging his battle against
another pharmaceutical company.

297
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,452
Top personal injury,
attorney Mark Lenier.

298
00:18:12,535 --> 00:18:14,583
This is absolutely outrageous.

299
00:18:14,662 --> 00:18:17,666
This is big pharma deciding
that they can take my client

300
00:18:17,749 --> 00:18:19,717
and make him a Guinea pig,

301
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:22,591
test their medicines on him,
make their money off of him,

302
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:25,844
and then just disregard him and
throw him away when he breaks.

303
00:18:25,923 --> 00:18:28,346
And that's outrageous
and we're gonna stop it.

304
00:18:28,426 --> 00:18:31,054
We're gonna stop it right
here in this court house.

305
00:18:31,137 --> 00:18:34,232
He's good.

306
00:18:34,307 --> 00:18:36,480
He's very good.

307
00:18:54,786 --> 00:18:56,584
Thank you for agreeing
to talk with me.

308
00:18:56,663 --> 00:18:58,791
Sure, no problem. Talk.

309
00:18:58,873 --> 00:19:01,752
On the phone you said you
were aware of the high number

310
00:19:01,834 --> 00:19:03,507
of accidental needle sticks.

311
00:19:03,586 --> 00:19:05,680
How about 800,000 a year?

312
00:19:05,755 --> 00:19:07,257
Is that an accurate number?

313
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,013
You don't believe me?

314
00:19:09,092 --> 00:19:10,844
No, it's not that
I don't believe you.

315
00:19:10,927 --> 00:19:13,055
I just wanna know if
it's an accurate number.

316
00:19:13,137 --> 00:19:16,562
I, Karen Brown, head of the Texas
Nurses' Association District Five

317
00:19:16,641 --> 00:19:20,066
do officially swear that that
number is accurate. Better?

318
00:19:20,144 --> 00:19:22,738
I'm just trying to get a
better understanding here.

319
00:19:22,814 --> 00:19:25,363
Good. Then here's what you
need to understand. Okay?

320
00:19:25,441 --> 00:19:27,239
The major cause
of these diseases,

321
00:19:27,318 --> 00:19:30,071
hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV,

322
00:19:30,154 --> 00:19:32,623
affecting all front line
health care workers

323
00:19:32,699 --> 00:19:34,918
is because of accidental
needle sticks.

324
00:19:34,992 --> 00:19:36,710
Okay?

325
00:19:36,786 --> 00:19:39,756
Okay. The reason I'm
here is 'cause my client

326
00:19:39,831 --> 00:19:43,711
has invented a safety needle that can
prevent this from ever happening again.

327
00:19:43,793 --> 00:19:45,966
Then don't talk to me.

328
00:19:46,045 --> 00:19:47,297
Who should I talk to?

329
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,223
The purchasing department.

330
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,848
Purchasing. Thank you.

331
00:19:54,971 --> 00:19:56,097
Mr. Weismann.

332
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,023
Weiss. Mike, please.

333
00:19:58,099 --> 00:20:00,852
Mr. Weiss, I cannot and will
not look at your needle.

334
00:20:00,935 --> 00:20:04,030
Because of the purchasing
contract that the hospital has.

335
00:20:04,105 --> 00:20:05,903
Will you at least
look at this data?

336
00:20:05,982 --> 00:20:07,325
No.

337
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,152
Would you mind telling me why?

338
00:20:09,235 --> 00:20:11,738
I don't want you
to show me your data,

339
00:20:11,821 --> 00:20:15,246
and I don't want you to show
this product to my nurses

340
00:20:15,324 --> 00:20:19,079
because they'll want it,
and they can't have it.

341
00:20:21,664 --> 00:20:24,258
What kind of a shirt was it?

342
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:27,712
Was it a nice shirt?

343
00:20:27,795 --> 00:20:32,301
- Yes, Mr.
- Paul, it was nice.

344
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,602
Was it a special shirt?

345
00:20:34,677 --> 00:20:37,647
Special?

346
00:20:37,722 --> 00:20:40,316
Maybe it was, a, uh, gift.

347
00:20:43,102 --> 00:20:45,446
It was just a shirt.

348
00:20:47,315 --> 00:20:49,033
How much did you say it cost?

349
00:20:49,108 --> 00:20:51,907
Uh.

350
00:20:51,986 --> 00:20:53,078
I don't remember.

351
00:20:53,154 --> 00:20:55,031
Let's say $70.

352
00:20:56,783 --> 00:21:02,506
Sylvia, could you, uh,
try Mike again, please?

353
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,335
Not if you wanna leave with all ten of
those tiny little fingers, young man.

354
00:21:06,417 --> 00:21:09,091
I just left him
a fifth message.

355
00:22:51,898 --> 00:22:53,696
Mike.

356
00:22:53,774 --> 00:22:56,152
Paul, you're awake.
You're not gonna believe this.

357
00:22:56,235 --> 00:22:59,956
I worked my way into a meeting with the
director of Infection at the hospital.

358
00:23:00,031 --> 00:23:01,658
What?

359
00:23:01,741 --> 00:23:05,336
That was today? Oh, shit, man.

360
00:23:06,454 --> 00:23:08,422
Hello?

361
00:23:18,716 --> 00:23:22,812
He said that Safety Point is fucking
essential to the safety of hospital...

362
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:30,813
I mean, we're looking at a shitload
of violations under State Law.

363
00:23:33,147 --> 00:23:37,323
Several violations on a shitload
of counts under false claims.

364
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:53,543
I'm looking for it.

365
00:23:53,626 --> 00:23:55,970
Take it, take it.
And I'll call him after lunch.

366
00:23:56,045 --> 00:23:57,388
All right.

367
00:23:57,463 --> 00:23:59,340
I'll call him after lunch.

368
00:23:59,423 --> 00:24:01,801
The Nursing Association I
represent requested I call

369
00:24:01,884 --> 00:24:05,388
in hopes that you'd help them with their
campaign in regards to this matter.

370
00:24:05,471 --> 00:24:07,940
If you'd give me a call back,
that'd be great, if not...

371
00:24:09,767 --> 00:24:12,020
Senator O'Hara's from Nebraska.

372
00:24:12,103 --> 00:24:13,821
Nebraska?

373
00:24:13,896 --> 00:24:16,274
Yeah, there's only 100 centers.
We could call...

374
00:24:16,357 --> 00:24:18,485
You mean we're like a team?

375
00:24:18,567 --> 00:24:21,161
That we agreed upon things
then we do them together?

376
00:24:21,237 --> 00:24:22,534
I said I was sorry.

377
00:24:22,613 --> 00:24:24,286
Twenty-two straight hours...

378
00:24:24,365 --> 00:24:26,868
I'm sorry.
Did you get the file I sent over?

379
00:24:26,951 --> 00:24:31,582
I got it. GPO's have been bribed to buy
certain products for the hospitals.

380
00:24:31,664 --> 00:24:34,292
I sent it over
to Dancort already.

381
00:24:34,375 --> 00:24:37,629
In the '80s, these GPO's got so big,
they managed to pass a bill in Congress

382
00:24:37,712 --> 00:24:40,215
allowing them a 3% commission
from the manufacturers

383
00:24:40,297 --> 00:24:42,299
they're supposedly
negotiating with.

384
00:24:42,383 --> 00:24:43,930
We have a great case here.

385
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,637
Yeah, we do.

386
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,142
I'm sorry, what was your name?

387
00:24:47,221 --> 00:24:48,768
Susie.

388
00:24:48,848 --> 00:24:50,441
Would you give us
a second, please?

389
00:24:50,516 --> 00:24:52,314
Sure. I'll be right outside.

390
00:24:56,397 --> 00:24:59,071
Look. Mike, I think that
we have a great case here,

391
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:03,121
potentially really great, but I need you
to be practical with me for a minute.

392
00:25:03,195 --> 00:25:04,822
Like hospitals
letting people die

393
00:25:04,905 --> 00:25:07,249
because Safety Point
costs five cents more?

394
00:25:07,324 --> 00:25:11,295
Mike, I'm in, all right? I'm in.
It's just that if this thing gets too big,

395
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:13,589
you need to let me bring in
another firm to help out.

396
00:25:13,664 --> 00:25:16,167
This thing is gonna
settle by Christmas.

397
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,129
It could drag for years. It's a monopoly
case and we're not an antitrust firm.

398
00:25:19,211 --> 00:25:21,805
What kinda firm we wanna be, Paul?
This is gonna make us.

399
00:25:21,881 --> 00:25:24,259
It could break us.
It's gonna be extremely expensive.

400
00:25:24,341 --> 00:25:27,686
Dancort can't afford to pay us and I
can't do enough injury cases on my own.

401
00:25:27,762 --> 00:25:30,515
What do you want me to say?
I'm sorry, all right?

402
00:25:30,598 --> 00:25:32,771
I'm sorry I messed
the fucking line.

403
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:35,899
Mike, listen to me. I'm telling you
that we don't have the resources

404
00:25:35,978 --> 00:25:38,151
to take this thing
all the way, so please.

405
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:41,700
I need your word that when I tell
you that the well is running dry,

406
00:25:41,776 --> 00:25:44,074
we bring in another firm
to help out, okay?

407
00:25:44,153 --> 00:25:48,579
Yeah. Yes.
Can we get to work now, please?

408
00:25:48,657 --> 00:25:51,126
Sorry.
Am I interrupting something?

409
00:25:51,202 --> 00:25:53,250
No, not at all. Come in.

410
00:25:53,329 --> 00:25:54,706
Thanks for coming down.

411
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:56,336
Have a seat.

412
00:25:56,415 --> 00:25:58,793
Well, right here
I got an invitation

413
00:25:58,876 --> 00:26:01,675
to a supplier's to
attend a conference

414
00:26:01,754 --> 00:26:05,600
from the United Medical
Health Supplies people.

415
00:26:05,674 --> 00:26:08,803
Largest group purchasing
organization in the country.

416
00:26:08,886 --> 00:26:11,480
And guess how much it costs
to attend the conference?

417
00:26:11,555 --> 00:26:13,148
How much?

418
00:26:13,224 --> 00:26:15,147
$25, 000.

419
00:26:15,226 --> 00:26:16,819
Twenty-five grand?

420
00:26:16,894 --> 00:26:18,817
What does that get you?

421
00:26:21,315 --> 00:26:25,036
I went to one of these dog and
pony shows about three years back

422
00:26:25,111 --> 00:26:29,833
for the low price of 75 grand,
and I didn't get jack shit.

423
00:26:31,325 --> 00:26:33,168
Hey. Mike Weiss.

424
00:26:33,244 --> 00:26:35,212
How are you?

425
00:26:35,287 --> 00:26:37,790
I am excited.

426
00:26:37,873 --> 00:26:43,004
These GPO guys represent over 4,000
health care providers in the US

427
00:26:43,087 --> 00:26:45,886
and they supply 'em
with $80 billion

428
00:26:45,965 --> 00:26:48,844
in medical products every year.

429
00:26:48,926 --> 00:26:52,055
Walkers and canes
and wheelchairs,

430
00:26:52,138 --> 00:26:54,687
commodes, bedpans.

431
00:26:54,765 --> 00:26:57,894
The only way to get your
product into hospitals

432
00:26:57,977 --> 00:26:59,854
is to go through these fuckers,

433
00:26:59,937 --> 00:27:02,065
so you have to pay
thousands of dollars

434
00:27:02,148 --> 00:27:05,027
for the opportunity to grovel in front
of a couple

435
00:27:05,109 --> 00:27:07,783
of United Medical Health
Supply muckety-mucks.

436
00:27:07,862 --> 00:27:08,988
Mike Weiss.

437
00:27:09,071 --> 00:27:10,664
Thanks for coming.

438
00:27:10,739 --> 00:27:12,537
But it's all just horse shit.

439
00:27:12,616 --> 00:27:15,210
You need real money
to get anything done...

440
00:27:15,286 --> 00:27:18,836
Gonna help prevent accidents from
happening to your patients and employees.

441
00:27:18,914 --> 00:27:21,793
And over time, it's gonna save you
money and it's gonna save lives.

442
00:27:21,876 --> 00:27:24,755
Does that sound like something
that might interest you?

443
00:27:24,837 --> 00:27:31,061
Are you aware there are over 800,000
accidental needle sticks a year?

444
00:27:31,135 --> 00:27:33,763
For 25,000, you can't
even stay for lunch.

445
00:27:33,846 --> 00:27:36,395
How much does it cost
to stay for lunch?

446
00:27:36,473 --> 00:27:38,726
Millions.

447
00:27:47,026 --> 00:27:49,120
♪ Take me to see
The voodoo queen ♪

448
00:27:49,195 --> 00:27:51,072
♪ Let her put A spell on me ♪

449

♪ Gonna set a Young man free ♪

451
00:27:54,992 --> 00:27:57,165
Whatever you do, don't
let me fall asleep.

452
00:27:57,244 --> 00:28:00,373
I think you'll be okay.
For four hours only.

453
00:28:05,502 --> 00:28:06,799
Want a hand job?

454
00:28:06,879 --> 00:28:08,927
Sure.

455
00:28:21,727 --> 00:28:24,355
They're gonna videotape me?

456
00:28:24,438 --> 00:28:26,816
We're gonna be okay.

457
00:28:26,899 --> 00:28:28,901
Hi. Paul Danzinger.

458
00:28:32,696 --> 00:28:33,868
Over here?

459
00:28:33,948 --> 00:28:35,575
Yeah. Let's have a seat.

460
00:29:03,102 --> 00:29:05,605
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

461
00:29:16,282 --> 00:29:17,909
Gentlemen.

462
00:29:17,992 --> 00:29:20,336
Thank you for coming.
It's much appreciated.

463
00:29:20,411 --> 00:29:21,708
Paul Danzinger.

464
00:29:21,787 --> 00:29:24,165
You must be Mr. Dancort.

465
00:29:24,248 --> 00:29:26,000
This grip. You golf?

466
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:27,926
No, I don't golf.

467
00:29:28,002 --> 00:29:30,346
Why so grumpy?

468
00:29:30,421 --> 00:29:33,470
You get the chance to eat?
Breakfast's the most important meal of the day.

469
00:29:33,549 --> 00:29:36,519
Would somebody please bring Mr.
Dancort a cup of coffee and a Danish?

470
00:29:42,433 --> 00:29:45,027
So, let's get down to it.
Are we waiting for one more?

471
00:29:45,102 --> 00:29:46,729
Let's just begin.

472
00:29:46,812 --> 00:29:49,486
Okay. Mr. Dancort,
we are here today

473
00:29:49,565 --> 00:29:52,865
so we can ask you some questions regarding
your allegations against my client.

474
00:29:52,943 --> 00:29:55,412
Before we begin, I would like
to establish for the record

475
00:29:55,487 --> 00:29:58,741
that you're aware that the deposition
is sworn testimony under oath.

476
00:29:58,824 --> 00:30:00,576
Yeah, yeah.

477
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:02,832
The court reporter will
be recording the session

478
00:30:02,911 --> 00:30:06,040
in the event that we would choose
to show the jury your testimony

479
00:30:06,123 --> 00:30:09,002
in a court of law.
If at any time during these proceedings

480
00:30:09,084 --> 00:30:11,758
you feel the need for a break,
please feel free to do so.

481
00:30:11,837 --> 00:30:13,680
Is everything clear so far?

482
00:30:13,756 --> 00:30:15,258
Is that a yes or a no, sir?

483
00:30:15,341 --> 00:30:17,093
Yes.

484
00:30:17,176 --> 00:30:19,520
Thank you. I'd like to
start by asking questions

485
00:30:19,595 --> 00:30:22,348
about your background.
Would you please tell me your full name?

486
00:30:22,431 --> 00:30:25,230
Jeffrey Matthew Dancort.

487
00:30:25,309 --> 00:30:27,107
Could you spell that, please?

488
00:30:27,186 --> 00:30:31,111
Jeffrey, J-E-F-F-R-E-Y.

489
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,659
Matthew, M-A-T-T-H-E-W.

490
00:30:33,734 --> 00:30:36,157
Dancort, D-A -N-C-O-R- T.

491
00:30:36,236 --> 00:30:38,113
Thank you.
Current address, please.

492
00:30:38,197 --> 00:30:41,997
1429 Merryweather drive,

493
00:30:42,076 --> 00:30:46,206
Houston, Texas, 74561.

494
00:30:46,288 --> 00:30:49,132
Thank you.
Is that an apartment or a house?

495
00:30:49,208 --> 00:30:50,960
It's a house.

496
00:30:51,043 --> 00:30:52,465
For how long have
you lived there?

497
00:30:52,544 --> 00:30:54,091
I don't know, about ten years.

498
00:30:54,171 --> 00:30:56,674
About ten years
or exactly ten years?

499
00:30:56,757 --> 00:30:58,600
We moved in there in 1986.

500
00:30:58,675 --> 00:31:00,643
That would be 12 years.

501
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:03,063
Yeah, that sounds about right.

502
00:31:03,138 --> 00:31:06,358
Sounds right or is right?
If you moved there in 1986, that would be 12 years.

503
00:31:06,433 --> 00:31:08,652
Be polite.

504
00:31:08,727 --> 00:31:10,354
Yes, that's right, sir.

505
00:31:12,231 --> 00:31:14,825
One moment, please.

506
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,072
Right.

507
00:31:32,126 --> 00:31:33,799
Oh, Shit.

508
00:31:33,877 --> 00:31:35,470
Oh, fuck.

509
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:38,682
Fuck.

510
00:31:39,758 --> 00:31:41,556
Fucking.

511
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,393
Fuck!

512
00:32:01,989 --> 00:32:04,868
Besides football, did you
play any other sport?

513
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,918
What the hell are we
talking about football?

514
00:32:06,994 --> 00:32:10,214
We case here to discuss the case.
Let's discuss the case.

515
00:32:10,289 --> 00:32:13,293
We wanted to get some simple
background information.

516
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:15,673
I'd like to request that my
client take a break now.

517
00:32:15,752 --> 00:32:19,723
Let the record reflect that the plaintiff's
attorney has asked for a break

518
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:21,550
without answering the question.

519
00:32:21,633 --> 00:32:23,852
That's okay. Keep going.
Just keep going.

520
00:32:23,927 --> 00:32:26,806
Continuing, besides football,
did you play any other...

521
00:32:43,447 --> 00:32:46,200
Excuse me. Nathaniel Price.

522
00:32:46,283 --> 00:32:48,160
I am.

523
00:32:48,243 --> 00:32:51,543
Mike Weiss.
Guess I'll be seeing you in court.

524
00:32:51,622 --> 00:32:53,465
I'm looking forward to it.

525
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,757
Good.

526
00:32:54,833 --> 00:32:56,335
Excuse me.

527
00:32:58,921 --> 00:33:00,423
Where the fuck were you?

528
00:33:00,506 --> 00:33:01,849
Not here. Outside.

529
00:33:06,136 --> 00:33:08,855
And what was the name of your first
dog, Mr. Dancort?

530
00:33:08,931 --> 00:33:11,901
Oh, well, Rufus.
And how do you spell that, Mr. Dancort?

531
00:33:11,975 --> 00:33:16,651
R-U-F-U-S. And were you fond
of this dog, Mr. Dancort?

532
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,859
Not particularly. Does that mean
you dislike dogs, Mr. Dancort?

533
00:33:19,942 --> 00:33:22,240
They showed themselves today.

534
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:25,448
They wouldn't have brought up the big
guns if they weren't scared of you.

535
00:33:25,531 --> 00:33:28,284
Yeah, they're terrified.
Scared fucking shitless all twelve of them.

536
00:33:28,367 --> 00:33:31,746
The reason I wasn't there today is 'cause
I was talking to a good buddy of mine.

537
00:33:31,828 --> 00:33:34,081
Henry Matthews, editor-in-chief
of the Houston Chronicle.

538
00:33:34,164 --> 00:33:36,963
They're going to run
a story on you.

539
00:33:37,042 --> 00:33:39,465
I'll see you guys
back at the office.

540
00:33:39,545 --> 00:33:41,388
Houston Chronicle.

541
00:33:41,463 --> 00:33:43,636
This is attorney Mike Weiss
calling for Henry Matthews.

542
00:33:43,715 --> 00:33:46,514
We don't have a Henry Matthews.
We have a Henry Mathers.

543
00:33:46,593 --> 00:33:48,766
That's what I meant.
Henry Mathers. Thank you.

544
00:33:48,845 --> 00:33:50,722
He's not in.
Would you like his voice mail?

545
00:33:50,806 --> 00:33:52,183
Sure.

546
00:33:52,266 --> 00:33:53,768
One moment, please.

547
00:34:09,908 --> 00:34:11,956
As soon as the sun goes down,
I'll be over there.

548
00:34:12,035 --> 00:34:13,662
Hey.

549
00:34:13,745 --> 00:34:15,338
Law and order. What's up?
What you need?

550
00:34:15,414 --> 00:34:17,041
Two hundred.

551
00:34:25,465 --> 00:34:27,308
This is Mike.

552
00:34:27,384 --> 00:34:29,807
What the hell kinda friends
have you got, Mike?

553
00:34:29,886 --> 00:34:32,514
Maybe you got some other
friends who can help us out.

554
00:34:32,598 --> 00:34:35,442
It's how these people operate.
They must've threatened the paper.

555
00:34:35,517 --> 00:34:37,565
I don't know what they
did or how they did it.

556
00:34:37,644 --> 00:34:40,773
I've just spent hours on the
phone dealing with my investors,

557
00:34:40,856 --> 00:34:45,703
my wife, my mother. This article claims
I'm having an affair with my assistant.

558
00:34:45,777 --> 00:34:47,905
Are you having an affair
with your assistant?

559
00:34:47,988 --> 00:34:50,116
No.

560
00:34:50,198 --> 00:34:53,202
Then what are you worried about?
They're just trying to smear you.

561
00:34:53,285 --> 00:34:55,538
This is to be expected.

562
00:34:55,621 --> 00:34:58,591
They're gonna try and make as many
people hate your guts as possible

563
00:34:58,665 --> 00:35:01,214
before we go to trial.

564
00:35:01,293 --> 00:35:04,092
Paul is making a lot of traction
with a lot of investors for you.

565
00:35:04,171 --> 00:35:06,424
When I get these motherfuckers
in front of the judge,

566
00:35:06,506 --> 00:35:09,976
we're gonna get your needle in every
single hospital in the country.

567
00:35:13,221 --> 00:35:16,350
Stay strong.
I'll see you in court.

568
00:35:18,226 --> 00:35:19,853
Is that Armani?

569
00:35:20,854 --> 00:35:22,527
Believe it.

570
00:35:55,013 --> 00:35:57,357
Is that a tux?

571
00:35:57,432 --> 00:35:59,605
It's Armani.

572
00:36:11,154 --> 00:36:12,906
All rise.

573
00:36:15,242 --> 00:36:18,246
The United States Federal
District Court is now in session.

574
00:36:18,328 --> 00:36:20,706
The Honorable Judge
William Black presiding.

575
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:24,672
Be seated.

576
00:36:26,211 --> 00:36:27,758
Right.

577
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:29,761
We are here
on plaintiff's motion

578
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,763
to compel the
production of documents

579
00:36:31,842 --> 00:36:34,061
that the plaintiff
claims are necessary.

580
00:36:34,136 --> 00:36:36,138
Since the defendants
are not allowing him...

581
00:36:36,221 --> 00:36:37,973
Your Honor, the
defendant's client has...

582
00:36:38,056 --> 00:36:39,433
No, no, Mr. Weiss.

583
00:36:39,516 --> 00:36:42,611
Sorry, Your Honor.

584
00:36:42,686 --> 00:36:45,781
It's an extraordinary large
request for production.

585
00:36:45,856 --> 00:36:48,279
Which documents must
you have and why?

586
00:36:49,693 --> 00:36:51,445
Request for production one.

587
00:36:51,528 --> 00:36:54,202
All exclusive long term
and multi-product contracts

588
00:36:54,281 --> 00:36:56,875
between United Medical Health
Supplies and all hospitals

589
00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:00,170
over the last ten years.
We feel this information will prove the GPO

590
00:37:00,245 --> 00:37:03,215
is engaged in anticompetitive
behavior, price fixing,

591
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:05,668
and a contract that requires
the company to buy products

592
00:37:05,751 --> 00:37:07,845
even though they may not
be the safest available.

593
00:37:07,919 --> 00:37:09,796
Under Dakota
vs. PMI Industries,

594
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,803
the Supreme Court
found this information.

595
00:37:11,882 --> 00:37:14,681
Mr. Price, your response.

596
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,809
Judge, this is a fishing
expedition with no merit.

597
00:37:17,888 --> 00:37:20,266
To expect thousands
of pages of documents

598
00:37:20,348 --> 00:37:23,693
is unduly burdensome to my
client's time and money.

599
00:37:23,769 --> 00:37:26,773
And the Dakota case
is not on point.

600
00:37:26,855 --> 00:37:28,277
Next request.

601
00:37:28,356 --> 00:37:31,030
Request of production 75.

602
00:37:31,109 --> 00:37:33,862
All donations made by the defendant
to health care organizations

603
00:37:33,945 --> 00:37:36,243
or political entities.

604
00:37:36,323 --> 00:37:39,452
Political contributions are not
discoverable under Benet vs. Lappin.

605
00:37:39,534 --> 00:37:42,333
Contributions to health care
organizations are not political.

606
00:37:42,412 --> 00:37:44,460
Next request, please.

607
00:37:44,539 --> 00:37:47,543
All purchase history of syringe
manufacturers made by the GPO

608
00:37:47,626 --> 00:37:50,220
in the past ten years.
We feel that this information proves

609
00:37:50,295 --> 00:37:53,014
that United Medical Health
Supplies has created a monopoly

610
00:37:53,089 --> 00:37:56,059
by buying syringe manufacturers,
then jacking up the price.

611
00:37:56,134 --> 00:37:59,104
Your Honor, the purchase and sale of
businesses are all of public records.

612
00:37:59,179 --> 00:38:01,352
My client shouldn't have
to go through the expense.

613
00:38:01,431 --> 00:38:04,526
Your Honor, we've submitted
cases supporting our position.

614
00:38:04,601 --> 00:38:07,150
The law clearly states we're
entitled to these documents.

615
00:38:11,817 --> 00:38:15,412
All right. My decision
is as follows.

616
00:38:15,487 --> 00:38:18,536
The court denies document
production one, two, three.

617
00:38:18,615 --> 00:38:20,959
Your Honor, we have the right...

618
00:38:21,034 --> 00:38:24,038
Request of production 1 through 12 denied.
13, 14, 15 are firm,

619
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,624
but I'm limiting production
to one year, not ten years.

620
00:38:27,707 --> 00:38:31,587
Sixteen through twenty-nine, denied.
Court adjourned.

621
00:38:33,463 --> 00:38:35,557
You must
be so relieved.

622
00:38:35,632 --> 00:38:37,885
We are ecstatic.
It's been three years in the making

623
00:38:37,968 --> 00:38:40,016
and we finally
got some justice.

624
00:38:40,095 --> 00:38:43,941
How do you suppose the jury
arrived at a $53 million verdict?

625
00:38:44,015 --> 00:38:47,645
I think the jury took that figure
from the profits the company made

626
00:38:47,727 --> 00:38:49,946
off not putting
the safety feature on.

627
00:38:50,021 --> 00:38:53,321
They are not gonna let corporate
greed trump the value of human life.

628
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,700
Let's talk about the family.
We're dealing with an eight-year-old boy.

629
00:38:56,778 --> 00:38:58,906
How are they doing right now?

630
00:38:58,989 --> 00:39:02,118
They're doing okay, but the
eight-year-old boy, he goes home with...

631
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,794
Safety Point's a
bigger case than that.

632
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:09,250
You know that every American will get into
at least one car accident in their lifetime?

633
00:39:09,332 --> 00:39:12,927
You know what the biggest reason is
that people get into car accidents?

634
00:39:14,504 --> 00:39:16,097
Eating while driving?

635
00:39:16,172 --> 00:39:18,095
Mm. No, that's only 49%.

636
00:39:18,174 --> 00:39:21,644
Talking to the other
passenger, 81%.

637
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,814
Fascinating.

638
00:39:23,889 --> 00:39:25,141
Where are you going?

639
00:39:25,223 --> 00:39:26,975
I'm gonna go talk to him.

640
00:39:27,058 --> 00:39:29,152
Hi, fellas.

641
00:39:29,227 --> 00:39:31,901
Are you boys hungry?

642
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,402
Yeah, sure.

643
00:39:33,481 --> 00:39:35,324
Well.

644
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,653
The process is one where
you fight in the courtroom

645
00:39:37,736 --> 00:39:41,991
for three weeks, and then
you've got an appeal going.

646
00:39:42,073 --> 00:39:45,418
And then we'll have that fight
and we'll win that fight.

647
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,344
Could you bring us a couple of
orders of shrimp cocktail, please?

648
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,798
I'm allergic to shellfish.

649
00:39:59,341 --> 00:40:01,014
Good to see you.

650
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:07,065
Listen, I-I don't wanna be
here today as a law firm.

651
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,893
I'd like to talk.
One person to another.

652
00:40:09,976 --> 00:40:11,944
What do you want?

653
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,022
I'll tell you
what I don't want.

654
00:40:14,105 --> 00:40:16,984
I don't wanna see you two going
down, and you're going down.

655
00:40:17,067 --> 00:40:19,240
Do I care who wins or loses?

656
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:21,993
Hardly. I have a job,
I do my job

657
00:40:22,072 --> 00:40:23,870
and I get paid at the end
of the day either way.

658
00:40:23,949 --> 00:40:25,576
How much you get paid?

659
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:28,128
You're funny, Mike.

660
00:40:28,203 --> 00:40:30,001
I like that you
have a sense of humor.

661
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,798
What can we do for you?

662
00:40:31,873 --> 00:40:33,466
You know who my client is.

663
00:40:33,541 --> 00:40:35,464
You're looking
at 300 attorneys,

664
00:40:35,543 --> 00:40:37,591
two dozen of the top anti-trust
experts in the country,

665
00:40:37,671 --> 00:40:40,845
millions of dollars in resources,
connections in every corner

666
00:40:40,924 --> 00:40:44,349
of the health care system, not
to mention the justice system.

667
00:40:44,427 --> 00:40:45,974
Don't forget the newspapers.

668
00:40:46,054 --> 00:40:47,226
The banks.

669
00:40:47,305 --> 00:40:49,808
Mm-hm. That's correct.

670
00:40:49,891 --> 00:40:51,893
Your client,

671
00:40:51,977 --> 00:40:54,400
he's something else.
He's an idealistic bumpkin

672
00:40:54,479 --> 00:40:56,732
who's been knocking on
every door in the city

673
00:40:56,815 --> 00:40:58,909
trying to get a loan.

674
00:40:58,984 --> 00:41:01,282
And you know why
he's not getting one?

675
00:41:01,361 --> 00:41:04,160
'Cause my client
didn't want him to.

676
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:06,742
So, are you saying that
there's a possibility

677
00:41:06,825 --> 00:41:09,203
of us actually
settling this fairly?

678
00:41:09,285 --> 00:41:13,210
Absolutely not. 7'hat's the only
thing that my client can't afford.

679
00:41:13,289 --> 00:41:18,170
If they gave you a settlement, they'll be
looking at lawsuits the rest of their lives.

680
00:41:18,253 --> 00:41:20,255
They aren't gonna do that.

681
00:41:20,338 --> 00:41:23,842
So, just do yourselves a favor.
Cut your losses now.

682
00:41:23,925 --> 00:41:27,930
You guys got no case.
No way out.

683
00:41:28,013 --> 00:41:31,438
Well, we appreciate
your concern.

684
00:41:31,516 --> 00:41:36,773
Son, you can't make chicken
salad out of chicken shit.

685
00:41:36,855 --> 00:41:39,699
Good day.

686
00:41:39,774 --> 00:41:41,367
Bob.

687
00:41:59,627 --> 00:42:01,721
She left a note.

688
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:16,186
Come on, buddy.

689
00:42:23,985 --> 00:42:27,535
Providing the
best health care products

690
00:42:27,614 --> 00:42:29,992
from Asia to Africa

691
00:42:30,075 --> 00:42:32,169
to here at home.

692
00:42:32,243 --> 00:42:35,497
United Medical Health Supplies.

693
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,298
Together in caring.

694
00:42:42,212 --> 00:42:44,010
What's up?

695
00:42:44,089 --> 00:42:47,844
My new equity partners just
backed out on Dancort.

696
00:42:47,926 --> 00:42:50,054
That was the last investor.

697
00:42:52,555 --> 00:42:54,148
Sorry.

698
00:42:54,224 --> 00:42:55,601
Me foo.

699
00:42:55,683 --> 00:42:57,902
Is there anything I can do?

700
00:42:57,977 --> 00:43:01,072
Can you convince another firm to come
on board and take over the case?

701
00:43:03,942 --> 00:43:08,197
Sorry. You need something?

702
00:43:08,279 --> 00:43:12,876
Bills. The most pressing being
the electric and the phone.

703
00:43:12,951 --> 00:43:14,874
I got an extension till Monday.

704
00:43:14,953 --> 00:43:17,331
It's okay.
I'll just figure something out.

705
00:43:22,544 --> 00:43:25,639
Hey, hon. Sorry.
I should be about ten more minutes...

706
00:43:27,799 --> 00:43:30,393
No. No, no, no, no.
Can you drive? Okay.

707
00:43:30,468 --> 00:43:32,937
Get in the car and go
straight to the hospital.

708
00:43:33,012 --> 00:43:35,811
I will meet you there.
No, get straight to the hospital.

709
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:38,894

Nicole Morris, sex therapist.
Who am I speaking with?

721
00:44:53,593 --> 00:44:55,641
Hey, I'm Mike.

722
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:59,350
Are you okay, Mike?
Do you need someone to talk to?

723
00:44:59,432 --> 00:45:01,480
I've been better.

724
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:03,402
My wife left me.

725
00:45:05,396 --> 00:45:08,070
She, uh, she took
all my furniture.

726
00:45:08,149 --> 00:45:10,652
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.

727
00:45:10,735 --> 00:45:12,157
Yeah.

728
00:45:14,697 --> 00:45:16,995
At least she left me
my alligator.

729
00:45:17,075 --> 00:45:20,170
You know my alligator
is 49 years old?

730
00:45:20,245 --> 00:45:22,748
Wow. So cool for a pet.

731
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:24,924
Actually not
for an alligator.

732
00:45:27,168 --> 00:45:29,717
You don't sound that old, Mike.

733
00:45:29,796 --> 00:45:33,175
Me? No. No, I'm, uh,

734
00:45:33,258 --> 00:45:35,932
I'm in my prime.

735
00:45:38,263 --> 00:45:40,357
Is that your baby crying?

736
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,694
No. That's the, uh,

737
00:45:44,769 --> 00:45:48,524
that's the office next door.
It's a pediatrics therapist.

738
00:45:48,606 --> 00:45:51,655
A little late for a baby to
be at the doctor, isn't it?

739
00:45:54,028 --> 00:45:56,281
Tell me what's
on your mind, Mike.

740
00:46:05,498 --> 00:46:07,796
I don't like to be alone.

741
00:46:07,875 --> 00:46:10,754
It feels better now that you're
talking to someone, doesn't it?

742
00:46:10,837 --> 00:46:12,839
Yeah.

743
00:46:14,299 --> 00:46:15,972
Hey, you think
we could meet up?

744
00:46:17,468 --> 00:46:19,220
Possibly.

745
00:46:19,304 --> 00:46:21,227
Mike, do you have
a credit card?

746
00:46:21,306 --> 00:46:23,149
Yeah, hang on.

747
00:46:31,316 --> 00:46:33,694
Immediate
medical attention.

748
00:46:33,776 --> 00:46:36,575
I 'd like to encourage you to
fake yourselves to our clinic.

749
00:46:36,654 --> 00:46:39,032
It's just two blocks away
on Main Street. Please.

750
00:46:39,115 --> 00:46:41,368
If you have a stomach
ache, a sprained ankle,

751
00:46:41,451 --> 00:46:44,421
anything that does not need
immediate medical attention...

752
00:46:44,495 --> 00:46:46,918
- Pete, don't.
- You're gonna get fired.

753
00:46:46,998 --> 00:46:49,251
They're not gonna
kick me out today.

754
00:46:49,334 --> 00:46:51,302
What's going on?
Who's getting kicked out?

755
00:46:51,377 --> 00:46:53,300
Welcome to the hospital.

756
00:46:53,379 --> 00:46:55,097
I 'm sorry.

757
00:46:55,173 --> 00:46:57,801
They canceled
my insurance today.

758
00:46:57,884 --> 00:47:00,558
Pre-existing conditions.

759
00:47:00,636 --> 00:47:04,106
What kind? Propensity to be
stabbed by sharp objects?

760
00:47:04,182 --> 00:47:06,935
Some goddamn thing.

761
00:47:07,018 --> 00:47:08,861
Let me go talk to somebody.

762
00:47:08,936 --> 00:47:11,189
No, no, no. Please, it's okay.
I'll take care of it.

763
00:47:11,272 --> 00:47:14,446
Pete, why don't you
get the boxes for him?

764
00:47:14,525 --> 00:47:17,028
David, Kia, you go
help him out, okay?

765
00:47:17,111 --> 00:47:18,579
Come on, guys.

766
00:47:18,654 --> 00:47:20,327
Hey, guys.

767
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:27,542
Why don't you let me
talk to somebody, Vicky?

768
00:47:27,622 --> 00:47:29,295
You okay?

769
00:47:35,671 --> 00:47:37,014
Thank you.

770
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:39,388
Sure. You all right?

771
00:47:43,012 --> 00:47:44,309
What about you?

772
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:51,150
Oh, that's... Yeah.
I, uh, I'm good.

773
00:47:52,397 --> 00:47:53,694
Jill, this is Mike.

774
00:47:53,773 --> 00:47:55,400
Hello.

775
00:48:01,114 --> 00:48:04,744
So strange being on the
other side of things.

776
00:48:04,826 --> 00:48:07,750
Having all the floor
nurses stand over me.

777
00:48:09,122 --> 00:48:12,171
I trained some of them.

778
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:16,380
They got these crazy patterns
on their shirts these days,

779
00:48:16,462 --> 00:48:19,181
like supposed to calm
the patients but...

780
00:48:19,257 --> 00:48:21,726
it ends up making you
feel dizzy.

781
00:48:24,554 --> 00:48:26,181
Mm.

782
00:48:33,438 --> 00:48:35,907
So, you said you
had something for me.

783
00:48:39,944 --> 00:48:43,494
You know, it's true what they say
about the stages you go through.

784
00:48:45,116 --> 00:48:48,495
Denial, anger, acceptance,

785
00:48:48,578 --> 00:48:50,626
blah, blah, blah.

786
00:48:52,999 --> 00:48:57,049
But it doesn't happen quite as
cleanly as the pamphlets tell you.

787
00:48:58,796 --> 00:49:00,469
In reality,

788
00:49:01,632 --> 00:49:03,509
it's a stew.

789
00:49:05,511 --> 00:49:08,390
Everything happens
all at the same time.

790
00:49:11,809 --> 00:49:13,026
Just because

791
00:49:14,896 --> 00:49:17,365
you can't really get
over the dark parts,

792
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,990
it doesn't mean you can't
get to the good ones.

793
00:49:28,409 --> 00:49:32,505
Sometimes the brightest light
comes from the darkest places.

794
00:49:40,755 --> 00:49:43,133
There you go.

795
00:49:43,216 --> 00:49:45,093
Thank you.

796
00:49:45,176 --> 00:49:46,644
Where did you get this?

797
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:48,813
Don't worry where
we got them from.

798
00:50:11,577 --> 00:50:13,830
Hey.

799
00:50:13,913 --> 00:50:17,588
Thompson Needles is coming out with
their own line of safety needle.

800
00:50:17,667 --> 00:50:20,796
You think they're threatened
by Safety Point or what?

801
00:50:20,878 --> 00:50:24,803
These are internal documents from United
Medical Health Supplies proving...

802
00:50:24,882 --> 00:50:28,853
Mike, stop it. Kim had to go
to the hospital last night.

803
00:50:28,928 --> 00:50:30,475
What?

804
00:50:30,555 --> 00:50:32,182
She's fine. False alarm.

805
00:50:32,265 --> 00:50:33,983
Is everything okay?

806
00:50:34,058 --> 00:50:36,481
No, everything's not okay.
Our insurance lapsed.

807
00:50:36,561 --> 00:50:39,314
What do you mean
our insurance lapsed?

808
00:50:39,397 --> 00:50:43,447
You told Sylvia to pay for you to attend
the United Medical Health Supplies dinner

809
00:50:43,526 --> 00:50:48,453
from the firm's account, and that you
would pay the insurance bill later.

810
00:50:48,531 --> 00:50:50,909
I'm sorry. It's not how I
meant for it to happen.

811
00:50:50,992 --> 00:50:54,587
That's not how you meant for it to happen.
Kim is pregnant, Mike.

812
00:50:57,957 --> 00:51:00,710
Look,

813
00:51:00,793 --> 00:51:03,763
I don't see how we can
possibly continue the case.

814
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:07,058
Mike, we agreed that
we would drop this.

815
00:51:07,133 --> 00:51:10,182
I agreed to take in another firm.
I never agreed to drop anything.

816
00:51:10,261 --> 00:51:12,605
I've called 50 firms
and no one will touch it.

817
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,808
I'm not dropping the case.

818
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:16,858
That's not your
decision to make.

819
00:51:16,934 --> 00:51:19,437
Do you wanna call
Dancort or should I?

820
00:51:22,732 --> 00:51:24,655
It's too big, Mike.

821
00:51:27,987 --> 00:51:32,538
I have Senator O'Reilly calling from
Washington, D.C. for you, Mike.

822
00:51:37,872 --> 00:51:39,215
Hello?

823
00:51:47,173 --> 00:51:49,972
Then the GPO, in our case
United Medical Health Supplies

824
00:51:50,051 --> 00:51:52,554
will draw up an exclusive
contract with Thompson Needles,

825
00:51:52,637 --> 00:51:55,231
who in turn give them a
kickback for every needle sold.

826
00:51:55,306 --> 00:51:57,775
Boxing out any competition
regardless of how superior

827
00:51:57,850 --> 00:52:00,273
or how much safer
their product is.

828
00:52:00,353 --> 00:52:03,653
If Thompson Needles is gonna come out
with a safe needle they'd have to retool,

829
00:52:03,731 --> 00:52:07,235
recast the molding. They'd have to
replace their entire assembly line.

830
00:52:07,318 --> 00:52:10,993
Something they're not interested in doing
because of the high upfront costs.

831
00:52:11,072 --> 00:52:13,416
Hm. Ingenious.

832
00:52:13,491 --> 00:52:16,119
This is a
tremendous innovation.

833
00:52:16,202 --> 00:52:21,208
As you know, I've been addressing safety
issues for hospital workers for years.

834
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:24,339
I'm intrigued by your product, Mr.
Dancort, to say the least...

835
00:52:24,418 --> 00:52:27,137
Thank you.

836
00:52:27,213 --> 00:52:30,342
This is a bill proposal mandating
the use of sound needles.

837
00:52:30,424 --> 00:52:32,426
We're in the process of
circulating a petition

838
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:35,263
in every single hospital
across the United States,

839
00:52:35,346 --> 00:52:38,816
so we can mobilize nurses' unions
an associations to help you lobby.

840
00:52:38,891 --> 00:52:41,735
Right. We have some interest
from some financial institutions

841
00:52:41,811 --> 00:52:44,030
regarding investment packages,

842
00:52:44,105 --> 00:52:48,235
and we're gonna try and get them in
every hospital across the country.

843
00:52:48,317 --> 00:52:53,619
Senator, you're giving us the
impetus to safe thousands of lives.

844
00:53:00,204 --> 00:53:02,707
Incredible.
That was incredible.

845
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:04,133
Great job.

846
00:53:04,208 --> 00:53:06,210
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

847
00:53:06,293 --> 00:53:08,216
Are you happy?

848
00:53:14,009 --> 00:53:17,434
Excuse me, Mr. Weiss.
Could I speak with you for just a second?

849
00:53:17,513 --> 00:53:18,765
Yeah.

850
00:53:21,934 --> 00:53:22,981
Senator.

851
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:25,279
Mr. Weiss.

852
00:53:25,354 --> 00:53:29,154
I wanted to let you know how much I
appreciate you and your colleagues

853
00:53:29,233 --> 00:53:32,203
bringing this to my attention.

854
00:53:34,572 --> 00:53:38,327
As I said, the safety and
well-being of health care workers

855
00:53:38,409 --> 00:53:41,003
has been high on my
agenda from day one,

856
00:53:41,078 --> 00:53:46,084
and we also agree that urgent
action is what is called for.

857
00:53:46,167 --> 00:53:49,011
That's great. It's...

858
00:53:49,086 --> 00:53:52,556
it's just-it's good to meet someone who
is on board to fight the good fight.

859
00:53:52,631 --> 00:53:54,599
It would be an honor
to offer my support,

860
00:53:54,675 --> 00:53:57,428
but only if you drop this case

861
00:53:57,511 --> 00:54:01,015
and let Mr. Dancort
team up with another firm.

862
00:54:07,354 --> 00:54:10,654
The cocaine under your nose.

863
00:54:16,322 --> 00:54:17,665
That's, um...

864
00:54:24,038 --> 00:54:26,507
I 'm not judging you, Mike.

865
00:54:26,582 --> 00:54:30,132
You're not the first person to lobby
a Senator hopped up on narcotics

866
00:54:30,211 --> 00:54:32,885
and I'm sure you're not even the
first person to do so today,

867
00:54:32,963 --> 00:54:36,593
but there's absolutely no way we can
put you before the House Committee

868
00:54:36,675 --> 00:54:38,848
let alone the Senate.

869
00:54:38,928 --> 00:54:40,680
Wait, just...

870
00:54:48,103 --> 00:54:51,653
My client has approached every law firm in Texas.
They've all said no.

871
00:54:51,732 --> 00:54:54,201
He's broke.

872
00:54:54,276 --> 00:54:55,653
This is...

873
00:54:57,947 --> 00:55:00,166
This is a major antitrust case.

874
00:55:00,241 --> 00:55:02,915
You know the type of money and
muscle that goes into it.

875
00:55:02,993 --> 00:55:05,212
Mr. Dancort does
not have the money

876
00:55:05,287 --> 00:55:08,040
to sit across from the receptionist
at some of these firms.

877
00:55:08,123 --> 00:55:13,095
My partner and I are the only ones
who are willing to take this risk.

878
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:15,889
We believe in this case.

879
00:55:15,965 --> 00:55:18,093
We believe in it.

880
00:55:23,973 --> 00:55:25,850
Give me a chance.

881
00:55:25,933 --> 00:55:29,187
I'll go back to Houston.
I'll get myself cleaned up.

882
00:55:33,148 --> 00:55:35,617
Okay.

883
00:55:35,693 --> 00:55:38,446
But know this.

884
00:55:38,529 --> 00:55:41,373
You only get one chance.
Don't fuck it up.

885
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:47,004
Understood.

886
00:55:48,914 --> 00:55:51,292
They're talking to
fucking Senators now.

887
00:55:51,375 --> 00:55:55,551
They're knocking on doors,
chickens with their heads cut off.

888
00:55:55,629 --> 00:55:58,974
We need to fix
this now, Nathaniel.

889
00:55:59,049 --> 00:56:00,471
I'll take care of it.

890
00:56:00,551 --> 00:56:02,645
They're losing patience.

891
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,020
I just need a bit more time.

892
00:56:06,098 --> 00:56:08,021
I'll try.

893
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:11,400
But you need to hurry.

894
00:56:11,478 --> 00:56:14,197
Or it's not gonna
be good for any of us.

895
00:56:49,099 --> 00:56:50,897
This is
a waste of time.

896
00:56:50,976 --> 00:56:52,444
Mike.

897
00:56:52,519 --> 00:56:54,567
Show some respect, huh?

898
00:56:58,233 --> 00:57:01,737
I'll show some respect by winning the
case that put her in the ground.

899
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:04,623
Fuck this.

900
00:57:13,457 --> 00:57:15,209
Fuck.

901
00:57:15,292 --> 00:57:17,260
Come on.

902
00:58:35,456 --> 00:58:37,800
The reason you...

903
00:58:37,875 --> 00:58:41,129
The reason why you should invest in
Safety Point is because it's safe

904
00:58:41,211 --> 00:58:44,306
and it's affective.
It's a life saving...

905
00:58:44,381 --> 00:58:48,761
it's a life saving device.
It's a life saving device.

906
00:58:48,844 --> 00:58:50,846
It's a life saving device.

907
00:58:50,929 --> 00:58:52,602
Your involvement...

908
00:58:55,017 --> 00:58:56,735
Are you all right, Mike?

909
00:58:56,810 --> 00:58:58,687
Yeah, I'm fine.

910
00:58:58,771 --> 00:59:00,489
You want something?

911
00:59:24,588 --> 00:59:27,262
I was always more of a
tinkerer than a businessman.

912
00:59:27,341 --> 00:59:29,969
It's how I thought
about myself anyway.

913
00:59:30,052 --> 00:59:33,352
My first office was in the
corner of a bicycle shop.

914
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:37,185
My first customer was an amputee
with an artificial leg.

915
00:59:38,519 --> 00:59:40,647
Hi. Good evening.

916
00:59:40,729 --> 00:59:43,699
I'm Paul Danzinger, and, uh,
I'd like to welcome you

917
00:59:43,774 --> 00:59:45,993
on behalf of my partner,
Michael Weiss,

918
00:59:46,068 --> 00:59:49,242
and of course the man who really
brought us all together tonight,

919
00:59:49,321 --> 00:59:51,824
Mr. Jeffrey Dancort.

920
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:17,900
I've been doing this
a long time, you know.

921
01:00:17,975 --> 01:00:20,649
Long, long, long time.

922
01:00:20,727 --> 01:00:23,981
And what I've come to realize is
that there's just people out there

923
01:00:24,064 --> 01:00:26,988
that all they wanna
do is fuck you up.

924
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:32,205
Right. You know what
I'm talking about.

925
01:00:32,281 --> 01:00:34,875
So, on this one I just
decided to say fuck it.

926
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:39,751
'Cause you know what?
A good idea is a good idea.

927
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:42,629
We're talking about
people 's lives here.

928
01:00:42,708 --> 01:00:45,837
Saving people's lives.

929
01:00:45,919 --> 01:00:50,425
This girl is dead because of
what we're talking about here.

930
01:00:50,507 --> 01:00:53,556
So, who gives a shit
about the bottom line?

931
01:00:53,635 --> 01:00:55,933
Well, I'll tell you
who gives a shit.

932
01:00:56,013 --> 01:00:59,062
The goddamn miserable
sorry ass motherfuckers

933
01:00:59,141 --> 01:01:01,894
who won't let the
hospitals use my needle.

934
01:01:01,977 --> 01:01:05,106
None of us in here might
even make ever a dime.

935
01:01:05,189 --> 01:01:07,533
The point is,

936
01:01:07,608 --> 01:01:11,909
that it's... The point
is Safety Point.

937
01:01:14,114 --> 01:01:16,913
And I want you all to

938
01:01:16,992 --> 01:01:18,585
think about helping us out.

939
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:21,914
It's just a good thing
to be part of and...

940
01:01:21,997 --> 01:01:24,546
Thanks for being here.

941
01:01:24,625 --> 01:01:26,298
Good night.

942
01:01:27,961 --> 01:01:30,885
Thank you very much
for coming and...

943
01:01:43,477 --> 01:01:45,605
How are you doing, Mike?

944
01:01:45,687 --> 01:01:47,985
I'm sorry.

945
01:01:51,235 --> 01:01:52,828
Oh, Shit, Mike.

946
01:01:55,948 --> 01:01:58,747
People don't bring
checkbooks to these things.

947
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:02,583
I can't do this any more.

948
01:02:04,081 --> 01:02:07,506
Paul, let's go home.

949
01:02:17,552 --> 01:02:19,429
Hey, Sylvia.

950
01:02:19,513 --> 01:02:21,982
Call ahead and tell them I
need an anesthesiologist.

951
01:02:22,057 --> 01:02:25,732
Put naltrexone on.
And I want the full treatment.

952
01:02:25,811 --> 01:02:28,405
I want the implant
under the abdomen.

953
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,575
Not the posterior...
Not the posterior rear.

954
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:35,154
I don't want anything in my
ass that doesn't have to be.

955
01:02:37,864 --> 01:02:40,868
Collapsed veins, infection of the heart
lining and valves,

956
01:02:40,951 --> 01:02:44,455
few abscesses.
The beginning of liver disease.

957
01:02:44,538 --> 01:02:48,338
Minor pulmonary complications and
what could be the start of pneumonia.

958
01:02:48,417 --> 01:02:50,135
Christ.

959
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:52,759
Typical.
He's going through withdrawal.

960
01:02:52,838 --> 01:02:55,216
I had no idea. I mean, I...

961
01:02:55,299 --> 01:02:58,052
I know he's taking some
painpills for his leg,

962
01:02:58,135 --> 01:02:59,557
but I didn't...

963
01:02:59,636 --> 01:03:02,435
He's a pretty heavy user.

964
01:03:02,514 --> 01:03:05,313
I guess the good thing
I reactivated the insurance.

965
01:03:05,392 --> 01:03:09,238
By the way, the treatment he
requested is gonna run about 25,000,

966
01:03:09,313 --> 01:03:13,534
and it's not covered by insurance.
Just a heads up.

967
01:03:13,608 --> 01:03:15,235
Great.

968
01:03:51,313 --> 01:03:53,031
What the...

969
01:03:59,488 --> 01:04:00,705
Hey.

970
01:04:00,781 --> 01:04:02,249
Hey. You got my clothes?

971
01:04:02,324 --> 01:04:04,747
Yeah.

972
01:04:04,826 --> 01:04:08,581
Whoa. Hey, don't you want me to get someone
to checkout? I'm gonna find a nurse.

973
01:04:08,663 --> 01:04:11,633
That's a great idea.
We're always underestimating nurses.

974
01:04:11,708 --> 01:04:13,961
I'll be right
with you, Mr. Weiss.

975
01:04:14,044 --> 01:04:17,298
You wouldn't happen to be a member of
the nursing association, would you?

976
01:04:17,381 --> 01:04:20,726
I'm standing in front the the
Houston Community National Hospital

977
01:04:20,801 --> 01:04:24,351
with a few hundred nurses and assorted
health care workers in protest.

978
01:04:24,429 --> 01:04:27,524
Joining me now is Karen Brown,
President of the Texas Nurse...

979
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:31,479
Every needle stick accident costs the hospital
thousands of dollars in follow up testing.

980
01:04:31,561 --> 01:04:35,657
If it's with an infected needle, it's
between 500,000 and $1 million per case.

981
01:04:35,732 --> 01:04:39,953
In this country there are roughly one
million needle stick accidents a year.

982
01:04:40,028 --> 01:04:42,201
Think about that.
You do the math.

983
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:45,159
We're fighting for the right of
every citizen to live in a country

984
01:04:45,242 --> 01:04:47,165
that values human
life over profits.

985
01:04:47,244 --> 01:04:48,666
Mr. Weiss, the hospital...

986
01:05:02,551 --> 01:05:04,428
Senator O'Reilly's office.

987
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:06,809
This is attorney Mike
Weiss for the Senator.

988
01:05:06,888 --> 01:05:09,516
Hi, Mr. Weiss. She just ended a meeting.
Can I take a message?

989
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:10,976
Sure.

990
01:05:14,729 --> 01:05:17,653
Why are these here?
They were supposed to go out yesterday.

991
01:05:17,732 --> 01:05:19,575
They sent it back.

992
01:05:19,651 --> 01:05:21,904
What the hell is that?
I thought we had a contract.

993
01:05:21,987 --> 01:05:24,285
Tell the Senator to return
my call as soon as possible.

994
01:05:24,364 --> 01:05:26,867
It's regarding the San
Antonio Memorial Hospital

995
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:30,045
canceling their contract
with Safety Point Syringes.

996
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:32,543
The CEO of San Antonio
Memorial hospital

997
01:05:32,622 --> 01:05:36,593
has been invited to sit on the board
of United Medical Health Supplies.

998
01:05:36,668 --> 01:05:40,047
Yeah, you think she'd like to hear
that in the news or return my call?

999
01:05:40,130 --> 01:05:43,134
Please, have her call me back.
This is attorney Mike Weiss.

1000
01:05:49,806 --> 01:05:52,980
I'm about to book a flight to DC.
This is bullshit.

1001
01:05:53,059 --> 01:05:56,359
The Senator's chief aid called this morning.
She's tabling the issue.

1002
01:05:56,438 --> 01:05:58,315
Tabling the issue?

1003
01:05:58,398 --> 01:06:01,277
What the fuck does that mean?
I'm going down there.

1004
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:04,454
United Medical Health Supplies just
made a very generous contribution

1005
01:06:04,529 --> 01:06:07,032
to the Senator's
reelection campaign.

1006
01:06:17,209 --> 01:06:18,836
What's this?

1007
01:06:18,919 --> 01:06:22,014
Kim gave birth last
night to a baby girl.

1008
01:06:22,088 --> 01:06:24,090
Six pounds, eight ounces.

1009
01:06:24,174 --> 01:06:27,269
Sam. She's beautiful.

1010
01:06:27,344 --> 01:06:30,393
Congratulations.

1011
01:06:30,472 --> 01:06:32,770
I'll be home with
them if you need me.

1012
01:06:34,392 --> 01:06:36,815
What are we gonna do
about the Senator?

1013
01:08:11,906 --> 01:08:13,658
Nicole Morris, sex therapist.

1014
01:08:41,895 --> 01:08:44,523
I like sex therapy.

1015
01:08:56,993 --> 01:08:58,836
Nice to meet you.

1016
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:17,981
She creeps me the fuck out.

1017
01:09:18,056 --> 01:09:20,275
I should say something, right?

1018
01:09:20,350 --> 01:09:21,727
Probably.

1019
01:09:21,810 --> 01:09:24,188
You wanna be the one?

1020
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:25,567
No.

1021
01:09:25,647 --> 01:09:27,991
Me neither.

1022
01:09:28,066 --> 01:09:31,240
Oh, hey, thanks for being
flexible attending the case.

1023
01:09:31,319 --> 01:09:33,697
I 'm a little behind.

1024
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:36,875
It's okay.
You don't have to worry about it.

1025
01:09:36,950 --> 01:09:40,295
I know. I'm just gonna check a few
facts and then I'll get it to you.

1026
01:09:40,370 --> 01:09:42,623
No, I mean, we don't need
it from you any more.

1027
01:09:42,706 --> 01:09:47,462
Look, I didn't... I didn't wanna
bring this up here but...

1028
01:09:49,379 --> 01:09:52,599
I'm really sorry.
My firm won't let me subcontract

1029
01:09:52,674 --> 01:09:54,472
any more work to you guys.

1030
01:09:54,551 --> 01:09:57,145
Not while you're working
on the Safety Point case.

1031
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:59,143
Are you serious?

1032
01:10:00,724 --> 01:10:02,317
I'm sorry.

1033
01:10:02,392 --> 01:10:05,771
I mean, you can
keep the retainer.

1034
01:10:05,854 --> 01:10:08,152
I wish there was something
else I could do, but...

1035
01:10:08,231 --> 01:10:10,359
I understand.

1036
01:10:11,985 --> 01:10:13,532
Excuse me.

1037
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,749
I'm not sure that's
gonna work for us.

1038
01:10:17,824 --> 01:10:19,326
Well, yeah, I don't...

1039
01:10:21,453 --> 01:10:23,626
Okay.

1040
01:10:23,705 --> 01:10:26,174
Let me talk it over with
my partner and my client.

1041
01:10:26,249 --> 01:10:28,502
I'll get back
to you in an hour.

1042
01:10:28,585 --> 01:10:31,338
All right.

1043
01:10:31,421 --> 01:10:35,346
That was Price. He wants us to
come out to his house tomorrow.

1044
01:10:35,425 --> 01:10:38,474
His house? Why?

1045
01:10:38,553 --> 01:10:42,103
You said that we'd settle by Christmas.
Maybe you're right.

1046
01:10:45,226 --> 01:10:47,149
I gotta call Dancort.

1047
01:11:00,617 --> 01:11:02,995
Mike!

1048
01:11:11,169 --> 01:11:13,422
Hand me that bag.

1049
01:11:16,299 --> 01:11:17,721
Mike, come on.

1050
01:11:17,801 --> 01:11:20,304
Just give me the fucking bag!

1051
01:11:55,088 --> 01:11:57,261
Gentlemen.
Thanks for coming out.

1052
01:11:57,340 --> 01:12:00,139
Give me a few minutes to wash up.
I'll be right with you.

1053
01:12:00,218 --> 01:12:02,516
Stephanie will show you
the way to the library.

1054
01:12:02,595 --> 01:12:05,348
If you need anything, she'll be
happy to get it for you, okay?

1055
01:12:10,270 --> 01:12:12,193
Right this way, gentlemen.

1056
01:12:13,898 --> 01:12:16,947
Dial nine if you need
to get an outside line.

1057
01:12:17,026 --> 01:12:19,279
And I'll be just down the
hall there to the left

1058
01:12:19,362 --> 01:12:21,911
if there's anything else I
can do for you gentlemen.

1059
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:23,287
We're fine, thank you.

1060
01:12:23,366 --> 01:12:24,743
Great.

1061
01:12:24,826 --> 01:12:26,794
You got any fresh
squeezed juice?

1062
01:12:26,870 --> 01:12:28,543
Uh, I can check.

1063
01:12:28,621 --> 01:12:31,044
Orange is fine.
Grapefruit is preferable.

1064
01:12:31,124 --> 01:12:33,297
I'll see what I can do.

1065
01:12:33,376 --> 01:12:35,970
Where 's your bathroom?

1066
01:12:36,045 --> 01:12:37,797
It's right here.

1067
01:12:50,727 --> 01:12:53,105
How long do we have
to fucking wait?

1068
01:12:56,107 --> 01:12:59,111
Gentlemen. It's nice, isn't it?

1069
01:12:59,193 --> 01:13:01,241
Fresh air.

1070
01:13:04,574 --> 01:13:07,498
Mm. Okay.

1071
01:13:07,577 --> 01:13:09,921
Let's get down to business.

1072
01:13:11,706 --> 01:13:13,834
First of all,

1073
01:13:13,917 --> 01:13:16,796
thank you for coming all the way out here.
It's much appreciated.

1074
01:13:16,878 --> 01:13:19,097
Now, putting aside

1075
01:13:19,172 --> 01:13:22,472
the fact that Safety Point Syringes
is having financial difficulties,

1076
01:13:22,550 --> 01:13:25,269
one of our manufacturing clients
is ready to put an offer

1077
01:13:25,345 --> 01:13:27,689
for it which I think you're
gonna find satisfactory.

1078
01:13:27,764 --> 01:13:30,893
Where 's that girl?
The girl that showed us in?

1079
01:13:30,975 --> 01:13:32,693
I'm not sure, Mr. Weiss.

1080
01:13:32,769 --> 01:13:34,487
Waiting on some juice.

1081
01:13:34,562 --> 01:13:36,906
I'm sure she'll bring it
when she can.

1082
01:13:36,981 --> 01:13:40,235
Like I said, one of our manufacturing
clients is interested in your company

1083
01:13:40,318 --> 01:13:42,741
and the needle and has
been for quite some time.

1084
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:46,870
This generous manufacturer wouldn't
happen to be Thompson Needles, would it?

1085
01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:51,376
They would like to remain anonymous
until there's an accepted offer.

1086
01:13:51,454 --> 01:13:54,833
And this anonymous client would then
own the patent to Safety Point?

1087
01:13:54,916 --> 01:13:57,886
That's right. My client is
interested in purchasing the equity

1088
01:13:57,961 --> 01:14:00,259
that comes from Safety
Point Syringes.

1089
01:14:00,338 --> 01:14:03,558
Would there be a contractual provision
guaranteeing a certain production

1090
01:14:03,633 --> 01:14:05,681
and distribution of the
Safety Point Syringe?

1091
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:08,684
Once my client purchases
Safety Point Syringes,

1092
01:14:08,763 --> 01:14:11,562
they'll have the right to
do with it as they see fit.

1093
01:14:11,641 --> 01:14:15,066
And what do they see fit?

1094
01:14:15,144 --> 01:14:17,067
Mr. Dancort,

1095
01:14:17,146 --> 01:14:21,151
my client is prepared to make
a more than generous offer.

1096
01:14:21,234 --> 01:14:24,659
This is great. You know your
client is in direct violation

1097
01:14:24,737 --> 01:14:27,240
and federal and state
antitrust laws.

1098
01:14:27,323 --> 01:14:30,827
You damn well know you won't win
this case if you go to trial.

1099
01:14:32,704 --> 01:14:35,924
You are a brilliant
engineer, Mr. Dancort.

1100
01:14:35,999 --> 01:14:39,003
Try applying some of that
towards your business sense.

1101
01:14:39,085 --> 01:14:42,589
I didn't sacrifice everything because
I was looking for a big payday.

1102
01:14:42,672 --> 01:14:45,551
I just want my needles
in those hospitals.

1103
01:14:45,633 --> 01:14:47,886
I'm sorry, Mr.
Dancort. I truly am.

1104
01:14:47,969 --> 01:14:51,849
I won't take any pleasure
in seeing you ruined.

1105
01:14:51,931 --> 01:14:55,231
That proposal is only
valid for three days.

1106
01:14:55,309 --> 01:14:57,311
No amendments, no negotiation.

1107
01:14:57,395 --> 01:15:00,239
Now, gentlemen, I have taken
up enough of your Saturday.

1108
01:15:00,314 --> 01:15:03,739
Stephanie will see you out.
I look forward to your response.

1109
01:15:49,864 --> 01:15:51,286
We have to take it.

1110
01:15:51,365 --> 01:15:52,867
Excuse me?

1111
01:15:52,950 --> 01:15:55,373
The offer. We have
to take the money.

1112
01:15:55,453 --> 01:15:57,205
What do you mean?

1113
01:15:57,288 --> 01:15:59,461
That offer at Dancort
Is not fair.

1114
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:02,419
They made the offer 'cause they know
they can't win. They're scared.

1115
01:16:02,502 --> 01:16:04,175
They're not scared, Mike.

1116
01:16:04,253 --> 01:16:05,971
They're scared we'll
take it to trial.

1117
01:16:16,349 --> 01:16:19,068
Do you even really care

1118
01:16:19,143 --> 01:16:23,239
if Safety Point needles
end up in hospitals?

1119
01:16:23,314 --> 01:16:25,988
No, seriously, I-I'm
asking you a question.

1120
01:16:26,067 --> 01:16:28,365
Do I care? Yes.
People are dying.

1121
01:16:28,444 --> 01:16:30,788
7'haz"s what you care about?
People dying?

1122
01:16:30,863 --> 01:16:32,581
Really?

1123
01:16:34,575 --> 01:16:36,168
We're taking the settlement.

1124
01:16:36,244 --> 01:16:38,747
No, we're not.

1125
01:16:38,830 --> 01:16:41,879
You want Dancort to walk away from
millions of dollars, and then what?

1126
01:16:41,958 --> 01:16:44,882
What happens to him when we
go to court years from now

1127
01:16:44,961 --> 01:16:47,180
and he's lost his
business and his house?

1128
01:16:47,255 --> 01:16:50,054
And then, then after all
that we lose the case?

1129
01:16:50,133 --> 01:16:51,385
We won't lose the case.

1130
01:16:51,467 --> 01:16:53,185
Okay, fine, we don't lose.

1131
01:16:53,261 --> 01:16:55,559
How do you want us
to survive until then, Mike?

1132
01:16:55,638 --> 01:16:58,107
We are broke. Broke, broke.

1133
01:16:58,182 --> 01:17:00,605
We have three weeks of overhead left
In the bank.

1134
01:17:00,685 --> 01:17:03,438
United Medical Health Supplies
has pretty much paid off

1135
01:17:03,521 --> 01:17:07,571
or pressured everyone in the United States
of America from giving us any new work!

1136
01:17:07,650 --> 01:17:10,904
How are you gonna go and rally
people behind Jeffrey in court

1137
01:17:10,987 --> 01:17:15,743
when you don't have a phone to call
them and to tell them where to show up?

1138
01:17:15,825 --> 01:17:17,668
I'm ending this...

1139
01:17:17,743 --> 01:17:20,121
I'm not ending shit.
I'll take a loan on my house.

1140
01:17:20,204 --> 01:17:22,172
You are so fucking delusional.

1141
01:17:22,248 --> 01:17:24,751
You're a big fucking pussy
who'd rather chase ambulances

1142
01:17:24,834 --> 01:17:26,381
then use the law
to save peoples lives.

1143
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:27,882
So you care about
people 's lives?

1144
01:17:27,962 --> 01:17:30,056
Yeah, I do.

1145
01:17:30,131 --> 01:17:32,759
Whose? The troop of hookers you
pay to hang out with? Your wife?

1146
01:17:32,842 --> 01:17:36,187
Fuck you, Paul. Like you really give a
shit about those pathetic scam artists.

1147
01:17:36,262 --> 01:17:38,185
We do neck braces
and fucking crutches.

1148
01:17:38,264 --> 01:17:40,562
Not just the settlements
they bring in, right?

1149
01:17:40,641 --> 01:17:43,144
You just wanna win.
That is all you've ever cared about.

1150
01:17:43,227 --> 01:17:47,357
At least I have the courage
to lose for what's right!

1151
01:17:55,072 --> 01:17:58,622
I'll call Dancort and tell him you're
no longer involved with the case.

1152
01:18:01,787 --> 01:18:03,915
I'll walk from here.

1153
01:18:31,776 --> 01:18:32,948
Hey, man.

1154
01:18:33,027 --> 01:18:34,620
How are you doing?

1155
01:18:34,695 --> 01:18:36,242
Thanks.

1156
01:18:45,831 --> 01:18:47,674
Excuse me.

1157
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:49,844
I'm all set, man.

1158
01:18:49,919 --> 01:18:53,514
Mr. Weiss, I used to work for
Thompson Needle Manufacturers.

1159
01:18:53,589 --> 01:18:55,933
Then go fuck yourself.

1160
01:18:56,008 --> 01:18:58,431
I was a friend of Vicky's.

1161
01:19:00,012 --> 01:19:01,855
She asked me
to come talk to you.

1162
01:19:03,724 --> 01:19:05,897
Thought it might be helpful.

1163
01:19:07,478 --> 01:19:09,276
You got a car?

1164
01:19:09,355 --> 01:19:11,449
Yeah. Follow me.

1165
01:19:12,817 --> 01:19:14,239
It's right over here.

1166
01:19:26,706 --> 01:19:29,755
You see, up until the 1960s.

1167
01:19:29,834 --> 01:19:32,337
Needle syringes
were made of glass

1168
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:35,720
which hospitals
sterilized with heat.

1169
01:19:35,798 --> 01:19:39,848
Thompson Needle Manufacturers refused
to switch to plastic needles

1170
01:19:39,927 --> 01:19:42,146
despite the money they'd make

1171
01:19:42,221 --> 01:19:45,350
because plastic needles
can't be sterilized.

1172
01:19:47,351 --> 01:19:49,979
The founder of the
company, James Thompson,

1173
01:19:52,690 --> 01:19:57,821
he was quoted to saying, "We'll switch
to plastic needles over my dead body."

1174
01:19:59,155 --> 01:20:02,910
Sure enough. In 1966,

1175
01:20:02,992 --> 01:20:05,916
the year he died,
Thompson Manufacturers

1176
01:20:05,995 --> 01:20:08,623
switched to plastic needles.

1177
01:20:08,706 --> 01:20:10,629
Within ten years,

1178
01:20:10,708 --> 01:20:13,928
hepatitis C and AIDS
were on the map.

1179
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:21,602
They knew that they'd be responsible for
spreading epidemics around the world.

1180
01:20:42,073 --> 01:20:44,201
This tape

1181
01:20:44,283 --> 01:20:47,537
has footage taken by a Peace
Corps worker in Nigeria.

1182
01:20:54,293 --> 01:20:55,966
Look.

1183
01:20:56,045 --> 01:20:58,013
You see those kids?

1184
01:21:01,717 --> 01:21:03,970
Children.

1185
01:21:08,057 --> 01:21:11,402
They get paid pennies to bring
used needles and syringes

1186
01:21:11,477 --> 01:21:13,900
to local pharmacies.

1187
01:21:16,065 --> 01:21:18,614
The clinics save on health
care by reusing needles

1188
01:21:18,692 --> 01:21:20,694
up to 200 times.

1189
01:21:22,405 --> 01:21:25,875
This is what's
going on everywhere.

1190
01:21:25,950 --> 01:21:28,829
Thompson Needle Manufacturers,

1191
01:21:28,911 --> 01:21:31,380
they're not only
not acting on this,

1192
01:21:31,455 --> 01:21:33,958
they're actually suppressing
knowledge of it.

1193
01:21:34,041 --> 01:21:37,261
The plastic syringe is the root

1194
01:21:37,336 --> 01:21:41,762
of the AIDS epidemic all across
Africa and Russia and India.

1195
01:21:41,841 --> 01:21:44,310
I'm sorry, they made an
offer to buy Safety Point.

1196
01:21:44,385 --> 01:21:46,513
We're advising
our client to take it.

1197
01:21:46,595 --> 01:21:48,768
Oh, come on, Mike!

1198
01:21:48,848 --> 01:21:52,443
You know if they buy it,
they're not gonna use it!

1199
01:21:54,270 --> 01:21:56,193
That needle

1200
01:21:56,272 --> 01:21:59,116
can save more than nurses here.

1201
01:21:59,191 --> 01:22:03,742
It can save millions of
lives around the world.

1202
01:22:03,821 --> 01:22:06,791
Yeah, well I'm just
a personal injury lawyer.

1203
01:22:08,909 --> 01:22:11,378
Not exactly in the best
place to go around

1204
01:22:11,454 --> 01:22:13,877
saving people's lives.

1205
01:22:23,757 --> 01:22:25,634
You know something, Mike?

1206
01:22:28,012 --> 01:22:30,686
Sometimes the brightest light

1207
01:22:30,764 --> 01:22:33,392
comes from the darkest places.

1208
01:23:37,206 --> 01:23:39,300
Get it before
it wakes the baby.

1209
01:23:39,375 --> 01:23:41,093
Hello?

1210
01:23:41,168 --> 01:23:43,637
Jesus Christ, Mike, you're
gonna wake the baby.

1211
01:23:43,712 --> 01:23:46,761
I'm hanging up now, all right?
We can talk about it tomorrow.

1212
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:49,184
Okay. Sorry.

1213
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:54,273
Is she up?

1214
01:24:26,046 --> 01:24:27,844
I like people that are nuts.

1215
01:24:27,923 --> 01:24:30,301
Keeps things interesting.

1216
01:24:30,384 --> 01:24:33,979
Do you know anything about the
original glass needle manufacturers?

1217
01:24:34,054 --> 01:24:36,853
Or anything about
plastic syringes?

1218
01:24:38,642 --> 01:24:41,816
You know, Michael?
Everyone goes to law school

1219
01:24:41,895 --> 01:24:45,274
to become a good guy.
To fight the good fight for justice.

1220
01:24:45,357 --> 01:24:47,701
Is that what you did?

1221
01:24:47,776 --> 01:24:49,244
Yes, I did.

1222
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:50,947
How is that working out?

1223
01:24:53,949 --> 01:24:56,873
Do you remember the big
tobacco law suits?

1224
01:24:56,952 --> 01:24:59,046
Of course.

1225
01:24:59,121 --> 01:25:03,422
Seven CEOs under oath lying in
front of Congress and on camera.

1226
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:05,798
And every state in the
Union suing them, right?

1227
01:25:05,878 --> 01:25:07,380
That's right.

1228
01:25:07,463 --> 01:25:09,682
You remember what
happened after that?

1229
01:25:09,757 --> 01:25:13,136
Yeah. We shelled out a $165 billion settlement.
That's what happened.

1230
01:25:13,218 --> 01:25:16,893
No, nothing happened.
Cigarettes are everywhere.

1231
01:25:16,972 --> 01:25:20,693
You know, new teenagers
start smoking every day.

1232
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:23,567
Billions of people
smoking worldwide.

1233
01:25:23,646 --> 01:25:26,570
Millions of people
dying every year.

1234
01:25:26,649 --> 01:25:28,367
Nothing happened.

1235
01:25:28,442 --> 01:25:31,912
Big tobacco got a spanking.
Slap on the wrist.

1236
01:25:31,987 --> 01:25:34,490
And the y were right back
to business as usual.

1237
01:25:36,992 --> 01:25:42,294
Hm. I assume you came here tonight to
try convince me to do the right thing.

1238
01:25:42,373 --> 01:25:44,546
You know, I'd look in your eye

1239
01:25:44,625 --> 01:25:48,630
and I'd go, "Oh, my
God, you're right!"

1240
01:25:48,712 --> 01:25:50,339
Then what?

1241
01:25:53,676 --> 01:25:56,145
Guys like me are
like cafeteria trays.

1242
01:25:56,220 --> 01:25:59,520
Take one off the top and there's
another one right underneath it.

1243
01:26:01,684 --> 01:26:04,437
Now I bet you
spent your whole life

1244
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:07,865
waiting that you, you were
born to do something great.

1245
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:11,285
Make a difference,
do something special.

1246
01:26:12,653 --> 01:26:14,701
Important.

1247
01:26:17,658 --> 01:26:19,877
But Michael.

1248
01:26:21,954 --> 01:26:25,800
It's the most ordinary
thought anybody's ever had.

1249
01:26:29,712 --> 01:26:32,261
I'll see you in court.

1250
01:26:34,216 --> 01:26:36,844
That might be difficult since
your client and partner

1251
01:26:36,927 --> 01:26:40,227
have already
accepted the offer.

1252
01:26:40,305 --> 01:26:42,273
You're right.

1253
01:26:45,602 --> 01:26:48,981
You might've settled with them,
but you haven't settled with me.

1254
01:26:49,064 --> 01:26:52,989
I'm gonna travel the country
making every hospital worker

1255
01:26:53,068 --> 01:26:56,242
who's ever been infected by
a needle stick my client.

1256
01:26:56,321 --> 01:26:58,949
Every mother
that's lost a child,

1257
01:26:59,032 --> 01:27:01,330
every child that's
lost a parent.

1258
01:27:01,410 --> 01:27:03,663
I'm gonna put them
on the stand,

1259
01:27:03,746 --> 01:27:06,340
and I'm gonna tell them that
your client has a needle

1260
01:27:06,415 --> 01:27:08,838
the could've prevented
it from ever happening,

1261
01:27:08,917 --> 01:27:13,138
but he keeps it locked up 'cause
it costs too much to make.

1262
01:27:16,049 --> 01:27:17,972
Trust me.

1263
01:27:18,051 --> 01:27:21,225
You're about to see just
how ordinary I can be.

1264
01:28:30,582 --> 01:28:31,754
Good morning.

1265
01:28:31,834 --> 01:28:34,087
Good morning to you.

1266
01:28:35,504 --> 01:28:36,801
What is this?

1267
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:39,224
That is a bonus

1268
01:28:39,299 --> 01:28:42,223
for all the hard
work you've been doing.

1269
01:28:42,302 --> 01:28:43,929
Are you serious?

1270
01:28:44,012 --> 01:28:45,605
I am.

1271
01:28:45,681 --> 01:28:46,933
Thank you.

1272
01:28:47,015 --> 01:28:48,858
You're welcome.

1273
01:28:48,934 --> 01:28:53,314
Um, listen, there's
along rambling message

1274
01:28:53,397 --> 01:28:55,024
on the machine from Mike.

1275
01:28:55,107 --> 01:28:56,575
Figures.

1276
01:28:59,069 --> 01:29:00,946
There he is now.

1277
01:29:01,029 --> 01:29:03,578
You're up early.

1278
01:29:05,409 --> 01:29:07,503
Yes?

1279
01:29:21,049 --> 01:29:22,642
You're his partner?

1280
01:29:22,718 --> 01:29:24,391
Yeah.

1281
01:29:42,279 --> 01:29:45,453
Died in his sleep.

1282
01:29:45,532 --> 01:29:48,661
So, here 's your partner,
Michael Weiss.

1283
01:29:54,875 --> 01:29:57,048
He die...

1284
01:29:57,127 --> 01:29:59,425
He die alone?

1285
01:29:59,504 --> 01:30:02,633
The detectives will be able to
answer some of those questions.

1286
01:30:02,716 --> 01:30:04,764
They'll wanna talk to you also.

1287
01:31:07,114 --> 01:31:11,585
Have you seen
these needles before?

1288
01:31:13,078 --> 01:31:15,706
That's, uh, it's
a safety needle.

1289
01:31:15,789 --> 01:31:17,712
They were used.

1290
01:31:19,668 --> 01:31:22,467
That'll explain why
there're so many of them.

1291
01:32:30,739 --> 01:32:32,616
Are you okay, Mr. Dancort?

1292
01:32:32,699 --> 01:32:35,828
Can we offer you something to drink?
Some tea perhaps?

1293
01:32:35,911 --> 01:32:38,164
No, that's all right.

1294
01:32:42,167 --> 01:32:44,135
Mr. Danzinger.

1295
01:32:44,211 --> 01:32:46,805
Sorry to hear about Mr. Weiss.

1296
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:49,850
We offer our most
sincere condolences.

1297
01:32:51,968 --> 01:32:55,222
So, since we're all here
we should probably...

1298
01:33:08,944 --> 01:33:11,663
Hello, Nat.
It's been a long time.

1299
01:33:20,455 --> 01:33:21,957
You and me?

1300
01:33:23,542 --> 01:33:25,715
We're going
to court on this one.

1301
01:33:36,721 --> 01:33:38,519
Looking forward to it.
