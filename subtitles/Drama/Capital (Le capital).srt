1
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:41,624
Dad!

2
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:42,792
Jack!

3
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,880
A golf cart!
And not a word.

4
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,257
To anyone!

5
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:59,517
That's the swing that changed
the CEO's destiny.

6
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,102
Mine, too.

7
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:03,896
I ghosted his book

8
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,859
and got his trust.
And an office on the exec's floor.

9
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,068
Then a 2nd book

10
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:13,072
with a formula that he liked to use
at his business meals:

11
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,075
"Money is a dog one needn't pat,

12
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,327
"it wants its ball thrown
again and again

13
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,414
"so it can do what's expected
of it indefinitely."

14
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:26,294
After that I became
indispensable to him.

15
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:30,173
I got an office beside his
and confidential assignments.

16
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,259
Until the day when...

17
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:51,319
Everything's fine, Claude.

18
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:55,198
Go back to the bank with Sieg
and check the rumors.

19
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,366
Total discretion.

20
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:01,496
Tourneuil. Go down with Claude
and come back up.

21
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,580
Yes, Mr. De Suze.

22
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,125
Let's go.

23
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:11,631
Jack hid his balls cancer.

24
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:14,342
It offended his virility.

25
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,719
Tumors?

26
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,523
Don't worry,
the rumors will die down.

27
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,483
Dad's resting a few days.

28
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:41,577
No priest?

29
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:42,870
Dad, stay in bed.

30
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,580
The chemo's over!
I'm fine.

31
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,791
We want you up and about.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,292
I am!

33
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,212
Come back soon, dear Jack.

34
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,840
We need to prepare the future.

35
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,466
And reassure the stockholders.

36
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,886
A new CEO?
So let's pick one!

37
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,850
I suggest Marc Tourneuil.

38
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,686
Jack, not Tourneuil.

39
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:09,564
After you,
he may seem a little bland.

40
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:14,151
5 years in New York at Goldman Sachs.
5 years in our front line.

41
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,736
I'll be at his side...

42
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:18,072
Dad's right.

43
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:21,367
Marc'll be very good.
Specially with the press.

44
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:30,167
The CEO's crazy.
Tourneuil as head of Phenix!

45
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,961
The CEO's on uppers!

46
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,546
- Then Bertrand?
- Who?

47
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,214
Bertrand de Saint-Robert.

48
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:39,260
Not that old queen running
the most powerful European bank!

49
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:44,557
No CEO, plus a power struggle
spells disaster.

50
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:48,144
The Americans'll move in.
Germans too. It'll be a free-for-all.

51
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:49,645
Let's take Tourneuil.

52
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,315
And hope the CEO's tumors do the rest.

53
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,191
Bye, gentlemen!

54
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,651
Bye.

55
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:58,821
Tourneuil screws her?

56
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,656
Her dad wishes he did.

57
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:04,619
Don't give Phenix to Tourneuil!
Who knows what makes him tick?

58
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,330
He's a good boy.
He'll do what we say.

59
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,041
While Marmande's around,
let's not make waves.

60
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,667
Then what?

61
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:14,629
We'll bury the pooch with his master.

62
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,715
By then I'll have trained
the CEO we need.

63
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,216
Gentlemen.

64
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,978
Yes, Claude.

65
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,438
Too heavy.

66
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,857
Oh, OK.

67
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:37,068
Very well.

68
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,903
Very well, Claude.

69
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,822
- Africa's cancelled. I'm needed here.
- Who's going?

70
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:43,491
No idea.

71
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,451
They post you, then cancel.

72
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,912
No explanation.
And you don't react?

73
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,705
Got a better idea?

74
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,540
Tell them to get lost,

75
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,086
quit, teach.
Write your books, not Marmande's.

76
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,088
We'll have a normal life.

77
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,257
I said "a better idea".

78
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,427
If Marmande's dying, they'll fire you.

79
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,806
I don't think that he's dying.

80
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,517
I'd have known from Claude's voice.

81
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,811
She'd cry, if she knows how.

82
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,063
You're dumb.

83
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,025
If you don't react,
they won't respect you.

84
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,903
Who needs their respect!

85
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,572
- What do you want?
- Money.

86
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,116
More?

87
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,367
What for?

88
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,745
To be respected.

89
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:59,275
Dear friends.
As you can see, I'm fine.

90
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,446
For two decades,

91
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,991
with your help,

92
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:11,620
I've turned Phenix into one of
the leading European banks.

93
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:16,625
Today we're going to place
at the head of Phenix

94
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,378
a young and talented man.

95
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,881
Attributes which aren't incompatible.

96
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,218
And I'll back him up.

97
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:30,306
He'll serve finance and our customers

98
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:33,601
with respect for the ethical
and political order,

99
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:38,147
so Phenix is constantly reborn.

100
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:40,858
Marc,

101
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,777
dear Marc,

102
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,905
it is with emotion that I...

103
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:48,449
entrust you with the rudder.

104
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:53,537
If you don't mind,
I'll hold on to the compass.

105
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,587
Here I am, Marc Tourneuil,

106
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:05,716
CEO of Phenix Bank
thanks to his master's testicles.

107
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,302
I can tell Marmande's game:
He wants

108
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:10,096
a temporary stand-in.

109
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,224
But why De Suze's gang go along?

110
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,267
Waiting for him to die?

111
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,353
The real question is:

112
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,730
How long do I have?

113
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:34,578
I've been summoned to De Suze's,
major shareholder.

114
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:36,872
His mansion's called

115
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:40,167
"the palace of intrigues
and backstabbers."

116
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,337
Hello, attorney.
Why here?

117
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:46,465
De Suze thought it'd be friendlier.

118
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,763
How are you doing in your CEO's duties?

119
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,723
Have I congratulated you?

120
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,559
Let me do so again.

121
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:01,438
We took a risk in naming one so young,
but I'm glad.

122
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,982
And don't forget:

123
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,610
A CEO signs checks.
fires people and eats well.

124
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,487
Watch your waistline.

125
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,533
We discussed Jack's situation.

126
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,495
He'll receive his salary for 2 years.

127
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:20,583
He'll keep his apartment,
his car and chauffeur, for life.

128
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,795
He wants to keep his office
and his right to use the jet.

129
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,383
That office symbolizes authority.

130
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,886
Jack, you'll have a similar office.

131
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:40,019
As to the jet, when I don't need it,
with pleasure.

132
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:53,240
We're offering an annual salary
of 1.8 million.

133
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,787
Marmande gets 2.4.

134
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,415
You want a cut-rate CEO?

135
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:09,381
Dear Marc,
that's exactly what we want for now.

136
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:13,677
Attorney.

137
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:16,972
We're considering
a variable bonus system.

138
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:20,809
If the Phenix shares
top the Euro Stoxx 50,

139
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:25,189
you get a bonus of 2 million.
If they're 2nd, 1 million.

140
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:28,901
3rd, 500,000.
Nothing if they're 4th.

141
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,653
In general, they're 4th.

142
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,614
In general, the bonus is 1 million.

143
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,160
You want to innovate, Marc.

144
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,745
Let's innovate.

145
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,288
So innovate.

146
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,469
OK.

147
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,139
Draw up the contracts.

148
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:01,350
Gentlemen...

149
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,023
Sure of your protégé?

150
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:12,528
He thinks he's really the CEO!

151
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:13,737
Let's dump him!

152
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:18,200
It's too late or too soon, Jack.

153
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,328
Evening, sir.

154
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,749
Your in-laws, sir.

155
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:33,215
I'm sorry, I had a hard day.

156
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,883
No, sit down.

157
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,803
- A CEO is always excused!
- Do sit down.

158
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,930
They were leaving.

159
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,308
Our train is at 9:15 p.m.

160
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,392
Dad wants a chat.

161
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,269
- Of course.
- Next time.

162
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,021
No.
Go ahead.

163
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,942
I know of a deal that could bring in
100 000 to 150 000 a year.

164
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,655
- Interesting...
- I'll have the file soon.

165
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,116
By the way, congratulations...

166
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,243
Our local press mentioned it.

167
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,620
That's wonderful!

168
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:05,914
They're for you.

169
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,878
What about your salary, dear Marc?

170
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,800
Get out!

171
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,177
Screw my salary.

172
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,720
Scram!

173
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,805
You get out!

174
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,183
We're negotiating.

175
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,768
I won't see you out.

176
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,188
I'll go hug Gabriel.
I haven't seen him in a week.

177
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,251
You made me lose.

178
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:07,684
Put it there.

179
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,280
Thanks, Dad.

180
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:28,414
"And your salary, dear Marc?"

181
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,623
"And your salary,

182
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:30,833
"dear Marc?"

183
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,921
You were odious to my parents!

184
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,048
I can do much better.

185
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,092
Was your meeting that bad?

186
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,887
1.8 million. A third less than Marmande.
Unbelievable!

187
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:49,560
150,000 Euros a month,
ought to be enough.

188
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:54,898
For you, wealth was long ago.
For me, it's the future.

189
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,109
You're all I need.

190
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,070
Low pay means low respect.

191
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,489
I never thought you'd do so well.

192
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,366
Turned on by the CEO?

193
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,201
No, by you.

194
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:09,746
Why did they pick me?

195
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,457
For your performances.

196
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,710
No.

197
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,754
Like you, they want to use me.

198
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,604
But you won't let them.

199
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,607
Yes, I will.

200
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,866
I'll take those three.

201
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,993
Two suits of each.

202
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:51,079
No pleats in the pants.
And not too tight.

203
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,665
I'm keeping you waiting, Mr. Rameur.

204
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,627
Matisse?

205
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,301
You dress?

206
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:07,095
- What?
- Do you dress left or right?

207
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:15,979
You're a policeman...

208
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,317
A retired one.
But still a policeman.

209
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,947
- What do you expect from me?
- What can you do?

210
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,200
Everything.
As long as it's legal.

211
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,413
And if it's illegal?

212
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,250
Everything.

213
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,210
Only the price changes.

214
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,132
I don't need a James Bond,

215
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,511
but someone who knows
how to sift through trashcans.

216
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,221
I'm good at that.

217
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:55,644
I wanted to know who on the board

218
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,938
was for or against me.

219
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,775
I still felt some passive hostility.

220
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:06,530
Alfred, a big mouth.
a financial genius,

221
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:11,076
has presidential aspirations.
Hides his ambitions.

222
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,080
Boris, the youngest.

223
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,375
Ambitious, minor talent.
a spiteful tongue.

224
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,627
Ferry...

225
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,630
Too dumb to defy me.

226
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:30,846
Matthew Malburry.
Anglo-Saxon duplicity.

227
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:34,683
Claude... Incompetent.

228
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,143
Doesn't like me.

229
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:38,770
Thinks I benched her Dad.

230
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,107
Raphael Sieg, a friend for 15 years.

231
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,817
Wanted my job.

232
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,570
Virtuous.
Good pianist.

233
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,698
We'll reduce

234
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,992
our loans to small businesses.

235
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,369
They earn us peanuts.

236
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,747
The government wants us
to lend more.

237
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,958
You work for the government?

238
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,253
We'll develop high frequency trading.

239
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,797
I'm doubling the number of traders.

240
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:09,968
What about the 50,000
hectares in Ukraine?

241
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,012
We're not farmers, Marc.

242
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,223
Your job is to finance,
not plow land.

243
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:20,228
Ferry, wind turbines
and nanotechnology?

244
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,898
Environmental industries are complex.

245
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,441
I need another month.

246
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:25,859
Hand it over to Malburry.

247
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,153
I want to regroup

248
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,323
and sell all our toxic products.

249
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,867
The hybrids with no liquidity.

250
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:35,452
That we inherited.

251
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,664
- They add up to?
- 3.7 billion.

252
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:43,669
We won't deal in weapons.
polluting chemicals,

253
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:45,003
money-laundering.

254
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,340
Tell the press we have
an ethical approach.

255
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,300
Insist on the fact

256
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,635
that our priority

257
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,970
is growth in Europe...

258
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,973
It's very urgent.

259
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,894
Raphael, I'll be right back.

260
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:13,198
Our ethical approach to things
is strangling small businesses

261
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,909
and we're investing our toxic assets.

262
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:18,829
A little dignity.

263
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,706
Dignity and ethics.

264
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:22,916
We'll rise to the heavens.

265
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,836
So will our stock.

266
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,457
I wanted us to be here together.

267
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:31,503
We haven't had time to forge a strategy.
We have to dive in.

268
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,714
You'll meet those who want
to eat us for dessert.

269
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:37,467
With a bit of luck and cunning,

270
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,302
we may eat them.

271
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,345
He left with them.

272
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,181
Where are they going?

273
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,187
We'll get fired.

274
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,982
Replaced by Yankees,
Irishmen and Indians.

275
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:05,568
No one's being replaced.

276
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,779
Even in your private talks?

277
00:24:08,823 --> 00:24:11,116
They said no more French capitalism,

278
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,452
cronyism with shareholders.

279
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,580
Performance will reign.
You didn't react!

280
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:20,041
We're dependent on a speculative fund,

281
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:23,711
managing billions at the speed of light.
We know that.

282
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:27,006
But we don't know what Miami
will do with Phenix.

283
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:33,263
We won't be judged
on "French bank ethics"

284
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,306
but on the truth of numbers.

285
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,393
Everyone should know that, Alfred.

286
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:39,936
I'm not everyone.

287
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:44,315
I agree with Alfred.
It's cowboy capitalism.

288
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,025
Don't overdo it.

289
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:51,573
Don't sacrifice Phenix
to preachers of instant profits.

290
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:56,870
I won't bare my ass
for those slimy bastards

291
00:24:57,037 --> 00:25:00,290
who bought Phenix
with a loan Phenix must repay.

292
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:07,172
Not baring your ass
isn't a creative strategy.

293
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:11,134
Let's hear how you plan
to counter this cowboy capitalism.

294
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:12,677
Go ahead.

295
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:30,028
Christophe wants to see us
at the Westin. It's urgent.

296
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:31,404
Come with me.

297
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:34,199
Sir, the press is on the runway.

298
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:35,533
The press?

299
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:38,745
Why the press?

300
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:42,749
- Who set up this crap?
- I got the press here.

301
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,752
Dad used to feed them a few tidbits.

302
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:55,929
Will you have to choose between
odious and preferable?

303
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,139
We have a plan,

304
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:01,768
that Claude Marmande
will explain to you.

305
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:03,436
Thanks a lot.

306
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:04,979
A few tidbits.

307
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:06,981
Thanks a lot.

308
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,873
- The usual.
- Yes, sir.

309
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:28,544
Still ready to head up
the New York office?

310
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:32,090
- That's up to Marc.
- Quit plotting.

311
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,841
Christophe,

312
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,593
I need Raphael.

313
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,679
We're heading into a storm.

314
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,098
Exactly.

315
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:45,019
The President wants to know
about these Americans.

316
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:49,691
Keep going.

317
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:52,735
The President's worried about you.

318
00:26:56,991 --> 00:26:59,117
What are these Americans like?

319
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:00,618
Very cool.

320
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:03,121
But their secrets...

321
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,168
Who's he?

322
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:13,423
A crook who got rich in Africa.
Needs a government contact.

323
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,009
- Yves Zombard, no?
- Yes.

324
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:20,555
Cool in what way?

325
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:23,474
A brutal hedge fund.

326
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,229
Their plan is to make Phenix
a U.S. style bank.

327
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:30,315
They mentioned relocation.

328
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,277
They like Paris, not France.

329
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,279
Too many social laws.

330
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:40,199
Save whatever you can
on the social level.

331
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:42,910
But avoid relocation.

332
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:47,373
In this economic situation,

333
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:50,460
any good news, even fake is welcome.

334
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:54,297
I see what the bank's doing for you,

335
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,133
not what you're doing for the bank?

336
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,387
The American banks
are waiting to devour us.

337
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:04,640
The ship's sinking,

338
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,518
and you're strolling
in your life jackets.

339
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,104
There's a war on

340
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:13,316
and you come up
with fantasy strategies.

341
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:16,444
We had to reckon with
the ratings agencies.

342
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,237
Screw those Mafiosi.

343
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:22,533
Papa Marmande's capitalism
with all its frills is history.

344
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:26,913
I want Phenix to be
a dynamic and committed outfit.

345
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:29,791
European, but able to compete globally.

346
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:32,543
We need long-term projects.

347
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:36,005
We need to react.
Be creative and committed.

348
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:41,094
It's a struggle.
Our independence is at stake.

349
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,763
I'm alone in the front line.

350
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,932
So follow me...

351
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:47,809
or leave.

352
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,937
We're with you, sir.

353
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:53,272
You're not alone.

354
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,819
We anticipated
the government regulations.

355
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,529
Change all that.

356
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,115
They won't dare regulate.

357
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:58,713
Excuse me.

358
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:01,799
Yes, sir?

359
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:04,719
Dittmar wants me to fire massively.

360
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:06,304
Yes, and?

361
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:07,972
What do you think about it?

362
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,182
Me, nothing.

363
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:12,810
You're the CEO.
It's your responsibility.

364
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:58,773
What's bothering you?

365
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,485
The Americans want me to fire people,

366
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:06,239
the French want me to fail,
my own execs are poised to stab me.

367
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,617
You gonna fire?

368
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,994
If I don't, I'll be fired.

369
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,664
Go back to teaching.

370
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,916
You get fired there, too.

371
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:19,460
Phenix is a ship.
I'll steer it well.

372
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,004
I'm looking for a way to do it...

373
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:23,798
To do what?

374
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,634
Cut staff without seeming
to fire people.

375
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:29,637
- Do like Mao.
- Who?

376
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:30,763
Mao Tse Tung!

377
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:33,641
In the cultural revolution.
he used the rank and file

378
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,476
to get rid of old timers.

379
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,437
I must pare the rank and file, too.

380
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:42,108
Easy.
Didn't you learn that at university?

381
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:44,151
It's called a social plan.

382
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:06,687
Bravo, sir.

383
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:09,940
It was great.
I fear the questionnaire may be...

384
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,734
This is very dangerous.

385
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:13,277
That's what I want,

386
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:15,946
something dangerous.

387
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,532
Your job is to make it a blessing.

388
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,951
Excuse us.

389
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:23,996
The unions are furious.

390
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,623
You're creating snitches.

391
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:28,042
Screw the unions!

392
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,502
Marc...

393
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,629
You can't fire 5,000 people like this.

394
00:35:31,797 --> 00:35:32,838
Who said 5,000?

395
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:36,008
You're a hit with the staff.
especially the women.

396
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:39,011
Send my speech to the media.
Words and images.

397
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,554
Who said 5,000?

398
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:47,394
With 7,000 layoffs,
our shares will move up from 12 to 18%.

399
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:51,816
At 10,000 to 26%,
and the shareholders' demands will be met.

400
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,610
I asked for this meeting
to settle my bonus.

401
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,070
My "layoff" bonus.

402
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,739
You're out of your mind!

403
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:02,034
Each layoff is a saving of
4,000 Euros a month.

404
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:05,371
I want the 13th month. Keep the others.
Let's say 3,000 per layoff.

405
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,293
A layoff bonus!

406
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:13,754
30 million for you.
It's extortion!

407
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,757
I didn't want these layoffs.

408
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:19,677
It's a lot of money for you, for you,

409
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:24,932
for you,

410
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,976
and for the stockholders.

411
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,270
But I must weather the storm.

412
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,738
It's short-term thinking.

413
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:43,409
I'm thinking of Phenix's social image.

414
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:45,077
And its future.

415
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:50,416
Your experts suggested 7,000.
It's better for public opinion.

416
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,585
The Minister advised moderation.

417
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:04,889
As a compromise, yes.

418
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:07,641
One third for those under 50.

419
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:10,561
One third plus 25% for those over 50.

420
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:20,779
Bahamas B,

421
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:24,825
Russia R, Ukraine U,

422
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:26,201
Niue N,

423
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:29,413
Cayman Islands I,

424
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,040
Sarawak S,

425
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,250
Switzerland S,

426
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:36,962
Aruba A, Guatemala G,

427
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,214
Egypt E.

428
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:42,551
We get B, R, U, N, I, S, S, A, G, E.

429
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:43,886
Brunissage.

430
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:48,891
How long will this rodeo take?

431
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:50,893
Six minutes or six months.

432
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:53,228
The longer it is,
the more secure it is.

433
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,271
Brunissage.

434
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:58,275
Letters for your accounts.
One forgets numbers, not words.

435
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,819
Brunissage.

436
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,073
- My dough goes to a sunny place?
- A shady one.

437
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,450
And it comes back white as snow.

438
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,620
What do you think of the situation?

439
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:16,502
The timing's good.

440
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:20,589
During a crisis gaps widen
and fortunes get made.

441
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:24,218
Especially when
you've feathered your nest.

442
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,640
Here's how things stand.

443
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:35,062
The "leak" about the layoffs
had positive results.

444
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,106
The government didn't react.

445
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:41,026
The staff trusts the CEO.

446
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,153
The market?

447
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,864
After the leak,
the shares rose by 5.9%.

448
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,741
Despite our denial.

449
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:50,911
This is my idea for massive layoffs.

450
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:55,708
1. The social plan
isn't a management ploy.

451
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,334
That's old hat.

452
00:38:57,544 --> 00:39:00,212
The problem is getting it across.

453
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:04,717
We must hit hard and
with surgical accuracy.

454
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:10,097
We put out a press release stating
"staff adjustments",

455
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:11,849
"competitiveness",

456
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,184
"the future of our business"...

457
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:18,814
She treats our social bloodbath
like it's golf.

458
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:20,566
And above all...

459
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:21,775
Claude.

460
00:39:22,444 --> 00:39:24,778
About the social plan, you're fired.

461
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,156
Out!

462
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:28,824
Right away!

463
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,788
...we announce a social plan
by another group,

464
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:36,331
and keep at it.

465
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:40,127
Thanks, Claude.

466
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:41,837
10 minutes pause.

467
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,264
Hello, Mr. Tourneuil.

468
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,476
One piece of news.

469
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,519
They didn't lie about Zombard.

470
00:39:57,687 --> 00:40:00,397
He's a crook,
with a laundered billion.

471
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:14,870
Bye.

472
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:22,169
Zombard!
He's with the Crédit Général.

473
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:24,421
He was.

474
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:29,301
This is an evaluation...

475
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:32,054
Everyone wants to interview you.

476
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:35,933
Sir, Isidore Sartre on the line.
He insisted.

477
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:38,560
I'm listening, Mr. Sartre.

478
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:41,021
May I know why I've been fired?

479
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:44,733
In your local questionnaires
you're called a dictator.

480
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:47,861
I get results.
If I'm not harsh, they idle.

481
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:51,698
A suicide at Phenix
would cause a market debacle.

482
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,450
Nobody's committed suicide.

483
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:54,785
It mustn't happen.

484
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:57,621
You're fired for misconduct.
Or resign.

485
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,414
What misconduct?

486
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:02,626
A hated leader is a bad leader.
That's misconduct.

487
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:04,545
I apply company policies.

488
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,755
That's over.

489
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,716
Your staff hate you.
You've lost my trust.

490
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:12,553
- Resign!
- I have the 2nd best results...

491
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,473
Why did he reach me?

492
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,809
He called all morning.

493
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,727
What did you expect?

494
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:24,106
The self-assessment
created hope, but that too.

495
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,609
Matthew, you were saying?

496
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:31,572
We can go to 7 or 8%.

497
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,241
That's less than 8,000 layoffs.

498
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:36,869
At least 10%.

499
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:38,954
Marc, that's bloodletting.

500
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:42,249
It'll create a revolt.
The directors are outraged.

501
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,793
Because we're seeing
their shortcomings.

502
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:49,089
I want to discuss
my transfer to New York.

503
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:53,093
Your self-assessment
made us a laughingstock!

504
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:54,720
We're being verbally abused.

505
00:41:54,888 --> 00:41:56,847
Hundred times a day.
This is harassment.

506
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:58,599
We can't go on.

507
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:02,019
Enough, Raphael!
You agree with us.

508
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,523
If this goes on, we'd rather resign.

509
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:09,484
I accept your resignations.

510
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,864
Marc, you can't be serious.

511
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:16,950
I'm very serious.
You won't be missed.

512
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,744
That'll be all.

513
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:23,415
Gentlemen, you may go.

514
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:30,589
Listen, they're your finest...

515
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:33,467
Raphael, it's not negotiable.

516
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,012
When the firing's done,
we'll discuss New York.

517
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,393
Hello, sir.

518
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:46,021
- They sent Madame's dress?
- Yes, sir.

519
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:56,448
Dior sent that?

520
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:59,993
I won't wear a 22,000 Euro dress.
It's obscene.

521
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:02,204
Not after your Maoist revolution.

522
00:43:02,372 --> 00:43:03,914
They told you the price?

523
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:05,415
I asked.
So what?

524
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:06,625
You must wear it.

525
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:10,545
You're a CEO's wife.
You must dress like one.

526
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:15,550
I don't want to have to dress
like a CEO's wife.

527
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,762
You got used to the apartment,
the jet, the chauffeur.

528
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,723
I want no part of it all.
I don't need it.

529
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:25,560
If it's too heavy,
you can drop it all.

530
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,563
But I'm not turning back.

531
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,453
Gabriel must be in bed by 9:30 p.m.

532
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:56,758
LUXURY IS A RIGHT

533
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,429
Good evening, sir.

534
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:01,972
I'm Tino Notti.

535
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,141
They expect you upstairs.

536
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:16,445
You know Dittmar?

537
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:18,322
Yes.
He's a friend.

538
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:22,701
- Your auto-revolution is great.
- Thanks.

539
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,501
Here comes the pain in the ass.

540
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:36,381
Be right there.

541
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:38,800
Evening, Minister.

542
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:41,511
I heard of a plan
against your predators.

543
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:43,597
I'll leave you to your plots.

544
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,435
Evening.

545
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:49,686
What's this plan?

546
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:52,064
An internal audit of the staff.

547
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,608
Which will lead to layoffs.

548
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,029
Mostly abroad.

549
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:02,949
And in France?

550
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,785
3,000 voluntary departures.

551
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,537
That's not good news.

552
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:10,874
You said that to
create jobs tomorrow,

553
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:12,876
we have to lose some today.

554
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:15,420
That was before the recession.

555
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:46,535
You know Nassim?

556
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,787
She's divine!

557
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,504
Evening, Marc.

558
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:01,007
Your project is great.

559
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:04,010
- See you at the dinner?
- Yes.

560
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:08,014
- See you at the dinner?
- We're not staying.

561
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:13,895
You OK?

562
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,162
Marc!

563
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:34,166
You know Kazarian?

564
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,421
The Minister wants
your conflict to ease.

565
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:41,339
What conflict?

566
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:44,134
You poached Zombard
with a crook's offer.

567
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,803
Of two crooks, he preferred me.

568
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:49,055
- That's not done.
- Antoine,

569
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:51,391
the frills are gone at Phenix.

570
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,269
We'll break you.

571
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:55,687
Try!

572
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,491
Nassim is a friend.

573
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:09,451
You have many friends.

574
00:47:09,619 --> 00:47:11,495
- I make a habit of it.
- She lives in Paris?

575
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,788
Everywhere.
The queen of supermodels!

576
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,081
She likes you.

577
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:19,461
Come.
Meet my friend Olivier.

578
00:47:20,213 --> 00:47:21,838
He wants to interview you.

579
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:23,840
Evening.

580
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:25,759
Your methods are fascinating.

581
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:28,595
People want to know you.
I can do an hour...

582
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:29,930
A minute is enough.

583
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,556
Thanks.

584
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:33,266
Here?

585
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:34,851
That OK for you?

586
00:47:35,937 --> 00:47:39,606
What do you think of this
campaign for luxury goods?

587
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:43,860
I'm for democracy in everything.

588
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:45,654
And?

589
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:49,991
Democratizing luxury goods
seems salutary to me...

590
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:52,744
I didn't know it was
such fun to spout crap.

591
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:54,079
...for happiness.

592
00:47:54,247 --> 00:47:58,875
I had to get used to it.
Now I'd go on every show.

593
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,386
- Tell me about the markets.
- We did fine.

594
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:10,720
Up 16%,

595
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:15,559
thanks to the new financial products
that your math geniuses concocted.

596
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:18,603
What exactly are we selling?

597
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:22,774
What?
I thought you'd be telling me.

598
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:24,818
You hired them.

599
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,204
Go ahead.
Practice.

600
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,751
Your ex-employees.
Boris and Alfred, chat a lot.

601
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:43,295
What do they say?

602
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:47,132
That De Suze and the Americans
are planning to fire you.

603
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,466
That you're a dickhead.

604
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:54,222
Go on?

605
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:56,600
Sieg met De Suze 3 times.

606
00:48:58,019 --> 00:49:00,687
Lunch in a dump with a €9.50 special.

607
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:03,023
"€9.50 special."

608
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,319
Sieg often phones the US.

609
00:49:10,031 --> 00:49:11,865
He wants to be moved there.

610
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:14,367
To be closer to your US friends.

611
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,787
Send me those pictures.

612
00:49:18,748 --> 00:49:20,248
Do I keep at the trashcans?

613
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:22,334
Sure.

614
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:23,668
I have a question.

615
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:27,464
I have some money to shelter.
Is another crisis due?

616
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:31,301
The big one's still due.

617
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,094
Call Craillon from me.

618
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:34,804
He'll fix that for you.

619
00:49:39,352 --> 00:49:42,646
Our paper graveyard.
11,000 layoffs.

620
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,356
With 1,200 in France.

621
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,400
The staff,

622
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,403
the execs, the top execs.

623
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:52,489
I'll keep this guy.

624
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:53,657
There'll be a strike.

625
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:56,326
A short one, yes.

626
00:49:59,372 --> 00:50:02,499
We'll do over 20% return on equity.

627
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:08,838
I doctored things a bit.

628
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:13,051
Marc,

629
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,929
I did everything you wanted.

630
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:18,139
When can we talk about New York?

631
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,892
I haven't forgotten, Raphael.

632
00:50:23,396 --> 00:50:24,562
Mr. Tino Notti.

633
00:50:25,064 --> 00:50:26,648
He says you know him.

634
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,985
I'm listening, Mr. Notti.

635
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:32,278
Hello, sir.

636
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,155
Great party!
Am I intruding?

637
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:35,156
Go ahead.

638
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:37,784
Nassim asked me to call you.

639
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:40,120
She's upset she sees so little of you.

640
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:42,122
She was thrilled to see you again.

641
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,624
She's sorry you didn't stay
for the dinner.

642
00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:47,335
She was superb on the runway.

643
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:49,879
Give her my best regards.

644
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,047
She's in London,

645
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:52,757
for the whole week.

646
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:55,927
Mr. Dittmar Rigule.

647
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:58,638
I must leave you, Mr. Notti.
Call again.

648
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:01,558
Yes, Dittmar.
I'm listening.

649
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:54,963
What was I doing here
visiting this fucking branch

650
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,715
instead of heading straight to Nassim's?

651
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:59,759
Was I the goddamn boss or not?

652
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:04,931
Mr. Tourneuil?

653
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:10,645
Maud Baron, projects manager.

654
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:24,576
Here you are.

655
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:26,744
Mr. Greenball will soon be here.

656
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,207
No, stay.

657
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:38,923
Can I get you a drink?

658
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,508
No, thanks.

659
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:44,304
How did the self-assessment go here?

660
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,306
- Not so well.
- Meaning?

661
00:53:47,016 --> 00:53:49,517
A French concept,
hard to put across here.

662
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:53,021
What should we have done?

663
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:56,524
Given the number of layoffs
and explained why.

664
00:53:57,568 --> 00:54:00,028
That wasn't our only goal.

665
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:01,779
No, but the main one.

666
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,990
Congratulations, sir.

667
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:05,658
I'm so sorry.

668
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:18,833
Thanks a lot.

669
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:23,171
Goodbye.

670
00:57:58,725 --> 00:57:59,559
Yes?

671
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:02,103
The President wants you in Brussels.

672
00:58:02,271 --> 00:58:05,523
The Elysée Palace is sending
a car to your place...

673
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:07,066
Impossible...

674
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,690
My head was spinning.

675
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:14,068
I said "Why are you telling
this stranger your life?"

676
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:18,322
You came to screw her,
and you're in this sleazy joint.

677
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:21,742
What did she make me swallow
to get me this high?

678
01:01:58,882 --> 01:01:59,840
Hello?

679
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:02,968
You got me very worried about Japan.

680
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:06,347
Come and show me your report in Paris.

681
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:09,767
Yes. sir.
I'm actually writing it now.

682
01:02:10,936 --> 01:02:12,269
Evening.

683
01:02:19,945 --> 01:02:21,821
Wait for me.

684
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:23,489
Marc.
Marc Tourneuil.

685
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:26,283
Just two minutes.
Elias Guigou.

686
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:28,327
Remember me, Marc?

687
01:02:29,413 --> 01:02:30,913
I'm out of work...

688
01:02:31,123 --> 01:02:33,541
Haven't had any for 3 years...

689
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:14,039
Marilyne.

690
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,333
Sir?

691
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:18,878
Send 10,000 Euros
from my account to...

692
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,922
- Elias Guigou.
- Will do.

693
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:28,447
I knew these assholes had a plan
to fuck me with this Mitzuko business.

694
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:30,824
But I didn't know what it was.

695
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:33,035
But I sensed that

696
01:04:33,203 --> 01:04:35,621
the Mitzuko deal was crooked,

697
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:37,373
dangerous for Phenix,

698
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:38,999
and fatal for me.

699
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:40,543
You OK?

700
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,461
Yes.

701
01:04:53,473 --> 01:04:55,474
- You OK?
- Fine.

702
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:00,521
Hello, Mum.

703
01:05:01,982 --> 01:05:03,065
Hi, Dad.

704
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:06,902
That's for you.

705
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:08,946
Kids!

706
01:05:09,114 --> 01:05:10,447
Come.

707
01:05:11,575 --> 01:05:14,910
Toys.
We financed a company in Korea.

708
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:20,624
Here.

709
01:05:20,792 --> 01:05:23,586
- Gonna show me how it works?
- Sure.

710
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,172
Want this one?
That one?

711
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:29,633
Which do I get?

712
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:31,969
I had it first.

713
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:36,432
Let's have Iunch.
We've waited enough.

714
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,725
How are things?

715
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:43,480
- OK?
- OK.

716
01:05:44,316 --> 01:05:45,733
And you?

717
01:05:46,526 --> 01:05:47,776
Very well.

718
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:51,572
Lovely, Nina.
Bring that here.

719
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:53,407
Thanks, darling.

720
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:55,075
I'll give you another.

721
01:05:55,243 --> 01:05:57,161
You won't leave empty-handed.

722
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:02,583
Well, Marc.

723
01:06:02,751 --> 01:06:05,127
If one's rich,
what should one invest in?

724
01:06:05,337 --> 01:06:07,004
In the pleasure of
your family, Pierre.

725
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:10,257
Spend it all.
And avoid banks.

726
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:13,594
They invest your money till...

727
01:06:14,262 --> 01:06:15,888
it's all gone.

728
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:18,724
Luckily we have none to invest.

729
01:06:21,728 --> 01:06:24,688
May I ask an indiscreet question?

730
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:27,066
I'm here for that.
Go on! Shoot!

731
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:31,070
When you earn 1.5 million a year...

732
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:32,946
what do you do with it?

733
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:36,075
- Cool it, Sylvie.
- Pierre, that's OK.

734
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:38,452
It's a good question.

735
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:42,122
I spend nights asking myseIf.

736
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:43,874
Luckily,

737
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:46,752
Diane helps me.

738
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:49,880
I do what I can.

739
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:52,257
You do it well.

740
01:06:52,467 --> 01:06:55,219
What reassures me,
is that soccer players

741
01:06:55,387 --> 01:06:59,014
who earn 4 to 5 times more
manage to spend it all.

742
01:06:59,224 --> 01:07:00,683
Reassuring, no?

743
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:03,394
No?

744
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:04,603
And you, Jeanne,

745
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:07,481
having a CEO son,
what does it mean to you?

746
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:10,984
That I see him less and less.

747
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:12,152
No.

748
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,320
I'm here.

749
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:15,698
And Diane, to be a CEO's wife?

750
01:07:16,408 --> 01:07:18,492
Also to see him less and less.

751
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:21,120
To go to boring dinners...

752
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:23,497
where they only talk about money.

753
01:07:26,418 --> 01:07:28,585
So, Uncle, this wine?

754
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:31,880
Marc.

755
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:36,844
Your bank makes money
and you lay people off.

756
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:37,928
How do you cope?

757
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:41,598
Bruno, not today, please.

758
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:45,436
He's the champion bungler

759
01:07:45,645 --> 01:07:46,937
of family meals.

760
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:49,773
Very badly, Uncle.

761
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:51,442
Very badly.

762
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:54,361
That doesn't answer my question.

763
01:07:57,490 --> 01:08:00,743
The bank was going under.
It had to be saved.

764
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:03,912
We had to fire people

765
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,206
to save 100,000 jobs worldwide.

766
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:09,501
Don't give me that.
I've heard it too often.

767
01:08:10,295 --> 01:08:12,296
You bleed people three-fold.

768
01:08:12,714 --> 01:08:16,717
1: The market wants blood.
you relocate, workers lose their jobs.

769
01:08:16,885 --> 01:08:19,219
2: You bleed them as customers.

770
01:08:19,387 --> 01:08:21,847
3: Via Europe's debts,
you zap countries

771
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:23,932
and their citizens get bled.

772
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,351
Worker, customer, citizen,
are the same guy,

773
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:28,437
so you screw him three-fold.

774
01:08:29,481 --> 01:08:31,440
Money turns everything rotten.

775
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:33,609
I expected better from you.

776
01:08:34,152 --> 01:08:35,986
Thanks, Uncle!

777
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:37,529
But you should be glad.

778
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:39,865
Why?

779
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:41,867
Because we relocate,
create unemployment,

780
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:44,912
raise prices to enrich stockholders

781
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:48,791
and break the social system
to pay off the debt?

782
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:50,959
Because you're successful?

783
01:08:51,336 --> 01:08:54,129
Because I'm fulfilling
your childhood dreams.

784
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:56,465
My childhood dreams?

785
01:08:56,883 --> 01:09:00,719
You lefties wanted internationalism.
We've got it.

786
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:04,473
Money knows no borders,
nor does work.

787
01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:07,726
Here, look.
See this toy?

788
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:09,812
I got it in London, it's German,

789
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:11,104
made in Indonesia.

790
01:09:11,314 --> 01:09:12,105
By children.

791
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:13,565
Maybe.

792
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:17,694
But the world you dreamt of
couldn't have fed those children.

793
01:09:17,862 --> 01:09:20,739
Our internationalism will manage.

794
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:22,866
I'm also working for that.

795
01:09:25,245 --> 01:09:26,870
New York.

796
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:30,707
Money never sleeps.
One must watch it like milk on a stove.

797
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:34,127
Or it boils over and
you have to fire people.

798
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,813
You know what your uncle’s like.

799
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:56,149
Uncle has a point, Dad.

800
01:09:57,402 --> 01:10:00,737
How'll you handle the Americans?
They only think money.

801
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:04,616
They're like us, they're businessmen.

802
01:10:05,076 --> 01:10:08,370
Like the banker who said:
"I do God's work."

803
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:10,914
Just words.

804
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:13,458
I'll be off.

805
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:15,002
Excuse me to everyone.

806
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:17,504
Tell Diane I'll send the car back.

807
01:10:18,172 --> 01:10:20,841
By the way, next time I come

808
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:23,051
it'll be to see only Mom and you.

809
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:50,370
Sir. You put me in charge
of Maud Baron's report on Japan.

810
01:10:50,538 --> 01:10:52,372
Yes.
Come in.

811
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:55,125
Maud Baron sent you her book.

812
01:10:58,463 --> 01:11:02,257
Mr. Tino Notti called.
Mrs. Nassim lost her credit cards.

813
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:03,258
So what?

814
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:07,095
Please pay her hotel tab.
She'll pay you back.

815
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:12,559
I knew she took me for a jerk
and I should kiss her off.

816
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:14,811
At the same time I said...

817
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:15,979
Wire the money.

818
01:11:16,147 --> 01:11:17,814
It's 27,000 Euros.

819
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:19,316
Do it.

820
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:22,486
So, Mr. Récamier, how's the report?

821
01:11:22,654 --> 01:11:24,237
Very good.
Excellent, sir.

822
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:25,238
Meaning?

823
01:11:25,406 --> 01:11:26,907
It's an analysis...

824
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:29,952
Marmande is dead.

825
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:44,967
I found him there.

826
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:49,471
Security never saw him come in
this morning, or leave last night.

827
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:52,349
Mr. Craillon.

828
01:11:53,101 --> 01:11:55,811
Gather his personal papers
and bring them to me.

829
01:11:55,979 --> 01:11:57,312
Those in the safe, too.

830
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:58,313
Very well, sir.

831
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:59,291
Marilyne, tell Malburry he's off to Tokyo.
I'll see him at 4 p.m.

832
01:12:59,459 --> 01:13:00,292
Very well.

833
01:13:00,918 --> 01:13:05,630
I want to tell you
of Jack's double suffering,

834
01:13:06,466 --> 01:13:09,217
that of his illness of course,

835
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:12,721
but also his inability to fully practice

836
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:16,141
a job he loved passionately.

837
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:20,604
To be with his staff,

838
01:13:20,772 --> 01:13:23,273
who were like his children to him.

839
01:13:24,692 --> 01:13:26,276
The family spirit...

840
01:13:28,029 --> 01:13:29,654
that he created...

841
01:13:31,032 --> 01:13:33,617
vanished with the changes...

842
01:13:35,995 --> 01:13:39,790
De Suze and his group
still want to grab Phenix?

843
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:45,670
...and turned Phenix
into a great European bank.

844
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:49,174
Being kept at a distance
was as painful to him

845
01:13:49,342 --> 01:13:51,301
as his disease.

846
01:14:01,521 --> 01:14:04,564
If you need anything, I'm here.

847
01:14:13,574 --> 01:14:14,950
Elena.

848
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:22,415
You're going to replace Claude.
She's taking a sabbatical.

849
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:25,293
- But, sir...
- If you're not interested...

850
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,462
- Of course I am.
- Very well.

851
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:36,012
Sorry.

852
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:37,430
Thanks.

853
01:14:37,598 --> 01:14:38,932
Well, sir,

854
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:41,893
this is what must remain confidential.

855
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:43,520
A few personal things.

856
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:48,733
And then...

857
01:14:50,945 --> 01:14:52,362
this.

858
01:14:55,867 --> 01:14:56,700
Shredder.

859
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:03,248
So, Marmande had four accounts.

860
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:05,792
His will is clear about three of them.

861
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:09,754
The 4th one, an account in
the Bahamas contains 30 million.

862
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:14,509
Does it belong to the bank?

863
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:18,763
No way. There are five withdrawals.
Where did that money go?

864
01:15:19,807 --> 01:15:23,768
To another numbered account.
We'll never know to whom.

865
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:27,772
Mr. Tino Notti.

866
01:15:28,191 --> 01:15:31,276
- Check with Claude Marmande.
- Shredder.

867
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:34,487
Not that, Mr. Craillon.

868
01:15:38,659 --> 01:15:41,870
- Yes. Mr. Notti.
- Hello, sir.

869
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:43,997
I have a message for you.

870
01:15:47,335 --> 01:15:48,168
Hi, Marc.

871
01:15:50,755 --> 01:15:52,047
Thanks a lot.

872
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:56,927
I wanted to thank you personally.

873
01:15:57,094 --> 01:15:58,845
Body and soul.

874
01:16:02,433 --> 01:16:04,935
Big hug.
See you soon.

875
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:11,149
She wanted to thank you herseIf.

876
01:16:11,484 --> 01:16:12,776
Where is she?

877
01:16:12,944 --> 01:16:15,403
In Tokyo, doing a shoot all week.

878
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:18,156
I'll be there in two days.
Tell her.

879
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:22,929
Sir, we'll be there in 45 minutes.

880
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:26,474
Mr. Notti called twice.
Nassim's leaving Tokyo.

881
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:30,145
- You should've woken me.
- You said not to.

882
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:35,483
Nassim can't see you in Tokyo.

883
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:37,444
I land in one hour.

884
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:41,489
She must return to New York.
She has serious problems.

885
01:17:41,866 --> 01:17:43,074
Maybe I can help?

886
01:17:43,534 --> 01:17:46,411
Ask her.
She's leaving soon for New York.

887
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:51,624
She'll be in the "La Première"
Air France lounge.

888
01:17:52,043 --> 01:17:53,960
Have a coffee with her...

889
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:57,130
A coffee with her...

890
01:18:36,212 --> 01:18:38,546
Evening.
I'm meeting someone.

891
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:49,511
- Who are those undertakers?
- Our best men at Phenix-Tokyo.

892
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:53,097
We'll meet now.
I'll fly off right after. Gentlemen...

893
01:21:36,475 --> 01:21:38,851
- What's it now?
- It's urgent.

894
01:21:39,687 --> 01:21:42,897
Nassim is disappointed with Tokyo.

895
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:46,150
Come.

896
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:52,115
Stay there.

897
01:21:52,992 --> 01:21:54,492
You intimidate her.

898
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:57,203
- She doesn't dare talk to you.
- Go on.

899
01:21:57,413 --> 01:22:01,916
You offered to help her.
She has lots of money, but it's tied up.

900
01:22:02,376 --> 01:22:03,543
How much?

901
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:06,879
A million.
She'll pay you back in a month.

902
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:09,966
That's a lot of money.

903
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:15,847
- Do I give it to you?
- Not to me.

904
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:19,517
Her bank details.

905
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:23,021
Evening.

906
01:22:25,899 --> 01:22:29,736
- When will I see her?
- She'll be in New York for a while.

907
01:22:37,536 --> 01:22:39,454
- Maud Baron.
- Marilyne. Delighted.

908
01:22:40,122 --> 01:22:43,333
I've read your book.
It's remarkable, original.

909
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,834
Thanks.

910
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:49,839
Make sure the Saudis don't wait.

911
01:22:50,007 --> 01:22:51,341
I stopped by.

912
01:22:51,634 --> 01:22:55,970
As you asked,
I checked out the Mitzuko bank,

913
01:22:56,138 --> 01:22:58,890
and the reasons for buying it.

914
01:22:59,058 --> 01:23:02,393
I wanted to hand it to you
myseIf and comment on it.

915
01:23:03,312 --> 01:23:05,396
Dittmar insists on
speaking to you.

916
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:06,814
Put him on.

917
01:23:07,358 --> 01:23:09,400
- Am I in the way?
- Not at all.

918
01:24:19,847 --> 01:24:23,558
Dittmar overdoes things.
He's the big shareholders' man.

919
01:24:23,726 --> 01:24:25,852
You wanted to talk about Mitzuko.

920
01:24:27,354 --> 01:24:31,482
Mitzuko has a credit crunch.
The reasons to buy it...

921
01:24:33,277 --> 01:24:34,861
Sir, they're here.

922
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:39,365
Let's have dinner.
Marilyne, set it up.

923
01:24:53,672 --> 01:24:55,465
You hungry?

924
01:24:55,632 --> 01:24:57,049
I'm not.

925
01:24:57,968 --> 01:25:00,303
Come.
We can't talk in there.

926
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:10,021
They want you to buy Mitzuko
so the shares of Phenix plummet.

927
01:25:10,898 --> 01:25:13,065
They own lots.
Why do that?

928
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:15,818
To buy the rest at bargain prices.

929
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:18,571
And take control of Phenix.

930
01:25:19,448 --> 01:25:21,741
So I buy Mitzuko...

931
01:25:21,909 --> 01:25:23,659
and look like an idiot.

932
01:25:24,995 --> 01:25:27,955
They take over Phenix and fire me.
That's it?

933
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:30,416
Or you don't buy Mitzuko...

934
01:25:32,211 --> 01:25:35,338
You're useless,
so they fire you anyway.

935
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:39,509
My fate is sealed.
No third choice?

936
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:42,261
Yes.
Resign.

937
01:25:42,805 --> 01:25:44,305
And denounce the scam.

938
01:25:44,473 --> 01:25:47,183
It'll create a major scandal
and you'll be...

939
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:51,145
A traitor for all banks in the world
and your hero for a week.

940
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:54,190
For much longer.

941
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:58,861
You'll be a hero for many people
and for a long time.

942
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:09,163
My dad was a vet, Mom a teacher.

943
01:26:09,331 --> 01:26:11,749
My sister became a vet, I got a PhD.

944
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:14,669
The pride of the family...

945
01:26:14,837 --> 01:26:18,965
Yes. Now they read everything
about bankers...

946
01:26:19,132 --> 01:26:20,883
and things are different.

947
01:26:21,718 --> 01:26:26,222
I wanted to teach economics.
and get the Nobel Prize.

948
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:28,349
Of course.

949
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:33,938
Instead I make the rich richer
and the poor poorer.

950
01:26:35,274 --> 01:26:37,525
Like any banker.

951
01:26:45,951 --> 01:26:47,577
I love coming here.

952
01:26:48,787 --> 01:26:50,746
I used to come with my parents.

953
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:52,874
Tell me.

954
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:56,961
What if I took a sabbatical
to write a book...

955
01:26:57,546 --> 01:27:00,548
About the cancer that's
gnawing at the banks...

956
01:27:01,258 --> 01:27:02,633
Would you help me?

957
01:27:05,512 --> 01:27:08,389
When you've decided, we'll talk.

958
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:10,641
I have to go now.

959
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:12,852
Good night.

960
01:27:15,856 --> 01:27:17,273
Maud!

961
01:27:25,282 --> 01:27:27,575
Wait for me here.

962
01:27:41,381 --> 01:27:43,257
I'll show you your zoo.

963
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:48,387
- What do you want to know?
- Her.

964
01:27:50,933 --> 01:27:53,184
Her house, her dad, her dog.

965
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:55,853
Brilliant worker, very honest.

966
01:27:56,063 --> 01:27:59,023
A choice piece.
No one's had her at the bank.

967
01:27:59,191 --> 01:28:00,149
Next.

968
01:28:03,946 --> 01:28:06,280
Slut, not a slut, or bait?

969
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:08,658
She's not a 1,000 Euro hooker.

970
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:09,992
For 1 million?

971
01:28:10,869 --> 01:28:14,121
- But who can pay that?
- You said bait.

972
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:17,041
- She can be used to entrap.
- Next.

973
01:28:18,669 --> 01:28:20,503
They still see each other.

974
01:28:20,671 --> 01:28:24,507
Sieg says you'll fire him.
De Suze says he'll fire you first.

975
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:26,926
He'll get your job.

976
01:28:30,263 --> 01:28:31,889
Next.

977
01:28:33,725 --> 01:28:35,434
Théo is...

978
01:28:35,602 --> 01:28:38,145
Sorry, Mr. Craillon is a fine banker.

979
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:42,650
His passion:
protecting other people's money.

980
01:28:43,485 --> 01:28:44,944
And Mitzuko?

981
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,198
Behind the stockholders

982
01:28:49,366 --> 01:28:52,618
is the Bull Funds group, in Miami.

983
01:28:56,123 --> 01:28:58,249
Do I keep sifting that trashcan?

984
01:28:58,417 --> 01:29:02,211
More than ever.
And don't neglect the others.

985
01:29:05,924 --> 01:29:08,676
No, study a plan
for buying out Mitzuko.

986
01:29:08,844 --> 01:29:10,553
That's what I'm asking you.

987
01:29:10,721 --> 01:29:13,264
But Marc, it's serious.

988
01:29:13,473 --> 01:29:15,933
You'll wreck Phenix.

989
01:29:16,435 --> 01:29:18,936
Do as usual.
Obey.

990
01:29:21,148 --> 01:29:23,274
Is Mitzuko serious for you?

991
01:29:24,443 --> 01:29:25,609
Look.

992
01:29:27,487 --> 01:29:30,448
Phenix buys Mitzuko,

993
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:32,033
which is worthless.

994
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:35,369
So Phenix's stock collapses.

995
01:29:36,788 --> 01:29:41,292
The money paid for Mitzuko goes into
the coffers of the guys in Miami,

996
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:44,712
who now buy Phenix.

997
01:29:48,717 --> 01:29:50,718
They buy Phenix with Phenix's money.

998
01:29:50,886 --> 01:29:53,262
They have the bank and the money.

999
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:56,599
It was to do that
that they made me king.

1000
01:29:56,767 --> 01:29:59,226
- Is that legal?
- No.

1001
01:30:00,353 --> 01:30:01,687
Denounce them.

1002
01:30:03,106 --> 01:30:04,231
We don't do that.

1003
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:06,150
- Why?
- We just don't.

1004
01:30:07,527 --> 01:30:09,487
It's like the Mafia.

1005
01:30:09,696 --> 01:30:11,906
Can you step aside?

1006
01:31:01,623 --> 01:31:03,624
Do you need all that money?

1007
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:07,294
What else is there?

1008
01:31:12,551 --> 01:31:16,554
I want to discuss you and De Suze
and a promising plan.

1009
01:31:16,721 --> 01:31:19,807
I only have business
relations with De Suze.

1010
01:31:35,657 --> 01:31:40,244
- What do you want, Marc?
- Just a little 9.50 Euro special.

1011
01:31:40,412 --> 01:31:41,912
Come.

1012
01:31:46,710 --> 01:31:50,629
They want me to buy Mitzuko
to get Phenix at a bargain.

1013
01:31:50,797 --> 01:31:53,257
And you and I are out.

1014
01:31:54,134 --> 01:31:57,303
If I tip you off,
you can beat them to it.

1015
01:31:58,430 --> 01:32:00,097
Not very ethical.

1016
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:06,312
Market ethics are like military ethics.
The first to shoot kills the other.

1017
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:09,440
But if he misses,
he's a dead duck.

1018
01:32:09,608 --> 01:32:10,691
Affirmative.

1019
01:32:12,736 --> 01:32:15,821
It stinks of insider trading.
That leads to jail.

1020
01:32:16,531 --> 01:32:19,867
It can make you a CEO.
And De Suze will control Phenix.

1021
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:28,209
- Is that stuff good?
- Revolting.

1022
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:31,879
I'm boning up for jail!

1023
01:32:34,883 --> 01:32:36,508
Go ahead.

1024
01:32:37,135 --> 01:32:40,763
I say I've bought Mitzuko.
Phenix's stock starts to drop.

1025
01:32:40,931 --> 01:32:44,725
Miami sells its shares, the stock
drops lower. Panic sets in.

1026
01:32:44,893 --> 01:32:48,479
The small stockholders follow suit,
the market is flooded.

1027
01:32:48,647 --> 01:32:51,398
Miami will wait longer
to buy a big block.

1028
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:55,152
I'll tell De Suze I bought
Mitzuko before I tell Miami.

1029
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:58,239
If he's organized,
he can beat them to it.

1030
01:32:58,406 --> 01:33:00,824
- De Suze will ask what you want.
- Nothing.

1031
01:33:00,992 --> 01:33:02,117
Too expensive.

1032
01:33:02,953 --> 01:33:05,454
25 million Euros.
In Switzerland.

1033
01:33:23,056 --> 01:33:25,266
Raphael, I'm harassed by reporters.

1034
01:33:25,433 --> 01:33:27,851
The CEO won't see me.
What's going on?

1035
01:33:28,019 --> 01:33:31,689
There are bad vibes on his floor
and it's spreading.

1036
01:33:32,232 --> 01:33:35,067
- There you are!
- Who's dealing with Mitzuko?

1037
01:33:35,235 --> 01:33:36,986
If the rumors are true, we're sunk.

1038
01:33:37,153 --> 01:33:40,447
- The CEO's at the helm.
- "At the helm"? Crap!

1039
01:33:40,615 --> 01:33:43,075
I trust the CEO.
He must have a plan.

1040
01:33:55,171 --> 01:33:57,798
I'll announce the Mitzuko
takeover tomorrow at 4 p.m.

1041
01:33:57,966 --> 01:34:01,510
- How much will it drop?
- To minus 60%.

1042
01:34:01,678 --> 01:34:06,015
Dittmar won't buy in until -55, -50%.
Act before that.

1043
01:34:12,439 --> 01:34:13,981
PRESS RELEASE

1044
01:34:21,156 --> 01:34:22,531
Sir?

1045
01:34:28,663 --> 01:34:31,123
Marc, the media won't let go of me.

1046
01:34:31,333 --> 01:34:35,461
The rumor's out about our
impending takeover of Mitzuko.

1047
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:39,590
It'll soon be official.
Shun the media. Let it see-saw.

1048
01:34:39,758 --> 01:34:43,677
Here, send it like that.
No interviews. It's all in there.

1049
01:34:44,429 --> 01:34:47,014
- But the quotes...
- It's all there.

1050
01:34:55,523 --> 01:34:58,650
Antoine...
It's your play.

1051
01:35:05,533 --> 01:35:09,912
Will that old fart De Suze buy in time?

1052
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:12,956
Won't the Americans beat him to it?

1053
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:18,295
What if they're all out
to put me in the slammer?

1054
01:35:19,422 --> 01:35:20,464
Bahamas!

1055
01:35:21,591 --> 01:35:24,259
Bahamas! B, A, H, A, M, A, S.

1056
01:35:24,427 --> 01:35:26,720
My dad's 4th account has been emptied.

1057
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:29,473
Nobody could grab that money.

1058
01:35:29,891 --> 01:35:32,059
Only you and Craillon
had access to it.

1059
01:35:40,026 --> 01:35:43,112
- Théo Craillon for Tourneuil.
- Mr. Craillon is away.

1060
01:35:43,321 --> 01:35:45,447
No news from him for 7 days.

1061
01:35:53,373 --> 01:35:57,126
- Rameur Company.
- Jean Rameur for Marc Tourneuil.

1062
01:35:57,335 --> 01:35:59,545
He went on a trip.

1063
01:36:00,171 --> 01:36:01,046
When?

1064
01:36:01,214 --> 01:36:02,714
7 days ago.

1065
01:36:10,348 --> 01:36:11,348
Well?

1066
01:36:12,976 --> 01:36:16,019
Claude, this is no time.
I'm swamped. Later.

1067
01:36:17,147 --> 01:36:19,565
You won't get rid of me like that.

1068
01:37:06,779 --> 01:37:08,614
Hello?

1069
01:37:21,794 --> 01:37:23,295
Mr. Dittmar.

1070
01:41:17,113 --> 01:41:18,488
We'll have a bite.

1071
01:43:59,150 --> 01:44:02,736
Now you're no longer CEO,
who's in charge?

1072
01:44:03,571 --> 01:44:05,238
The economic situation.

1073
01:44:05,406 --> 01:44:07,657
Who's "the economic situation"?

1074
01:44:07,825 --> 01:44:11,828
A fat whore...
Who runs everything, everywhere.

1075
01:44:20,463 --> 01:44:21,671
Marc?

1076
01:44:23,591 --> 01:44:25,508
What's in store for you today?

1077
01:44:25,718 --> 01:44:27,719
Jail, CEO, or sabbatical?

1078
01:44:27,887 --> 01:44:29,220
The fat whore will decide.

1079
01:44:30,431 --> 01:44:34,142
If you go to prison,
I'll be there when you get out.

1080
01:44:35,019 --> 01:44:38,271
But if you're CEO,
I'll be gone from our home.

1081
01:44:50,576 --> 01:44:51,993
It's all there.

1082
01:44:56,540 --> 01:44:57,999
Be right there.

1083
01:45:05,466 --> 01:45:07,592
I hear you resigned as CEO.

1084
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:10,428
I had to make that choice.

1085
01:45:10,638 --> 01:45:13,223
I came to say I admire your courage.

1086
01:45:13,391 --> 01:45:17,435
I'm at your disposal
to help you with your book.

1087
01:45:17,645 --> 01:45:18,812
My book?

1088
01:45:20,606 --> 01:45:23,733
Robin Hood for the Rich.
That could be the title.

1089
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:26,319
What'd I say in that book?

1090
01:45:26,487 --> 01:45:28,154
I mean what'd we say?

1091
01:45:29,031 --> 01:45:31,199
You'd tell about...

1092
01:45:32,201 --> 01:45:36,037
banks in the claws of
predatory stockholders.

1093
01:45:36,205 --> 01:45:39,499
The dictatorship of
the markets, speculation,

1094
01:45:39,667 --> 01:45:42,669
the rating agencies that run
the economy for politicos,

1095
01:45:43,254 --> 01:45:44,587
that threaten society.

1096
01:45:45,756 --> 01:45:49,759
A book on democratic states
that can no longer

1097
01:45:49,927 --> 01:45:53,221
govern or get rid of banks
who stifle them.

1098
01:45:55,683 --> 01:45:58,727
You're the only one...

1099
01:45:59,395 --> 01:46:02,105
You're so young.
You speak with such fire...

1100
01:46:02,314 --> 01:46:03,940
Sorry?

1101
01:46:05,443 --> 01:46:07,277
We're playing, Maud.

1102
01:46:08,237 --> 01:46:09,320
It's a game.

1103
01:46:10,906 --> 01:46:15,035
An unfair game that's a bit cruel.
But it's planetary.

1104
01:46:15,202 --> 01:46:17,829
No one can quit and say,
"I won't play anymore."

1105
01:46:18,998 --> 01:46:23,084
What of those who lose
their jobs, their lives,

1106
01:46:23,252 --> 01:46:25,670
to enrich the stockholders?
They in it too?

1107
01:46:25,838 --> 01:46:29,174
Like in all games,
there are winners and losers.

1108
01:46:30,051 --> 01:46:32,385
The winners can lose everything.

1109
01:46:32,553 --> 01:46:34,637
But the losers can win, too.

1110
01:46:34,805 --> 01:46:36,681
That's the beauty of the game.

1111
01:46:40,269 --> 01:46:43,980
You think I'm young,
I think you've aged fast.

1112
01:47:04,460 --> 01:47:06,503
Can you leave us, please?

1113
01:47:17,973 --> 01:47:20,558
We'll sue you for insider trading.

1114
01:47:21,352 --> 01:47:22,894
That'll put you in jail.

1115
01:47:24,355 --> 01:47:26,189
We're all in it together.

1116
01:47:26,357 --> 01:47:29,692
The judge will say you
benefitted from it.

1117
01:47:30,152 --> 01:47:32,070
That your group controls the bank.

1118
01:47:32,238 --> 01:47:33,905
That you'll be its CEO.

1119
01:47:34,532 --> 01:47:36,491
He's the CEO.

1120
01:47:36,659 --> 01:47:39,035
Marc Tourneuil will
have his 25 million.

1121
01:47:39,411 --> 01:47:41,579
Will you tell the judge that?

1122
01:47:41,747 --> 01:47:43,998
That's not what Marc Tourneuil wants.

1123
01:47:45,793 --> 01:47:49,879
- Meaning?
- What does Marc Tourneuil want?

1124
01:47:56,053 --> 01:47:58,888
Phenix was the target
of disloyal attacks.

1125
01:47:59,056 --> 01:48:03,434
But we withstood them
and overcame our enemies,

1126
01:48:03,602 --> 01:48:07,730
thanks to the actions and vision
of one of our teammates.

1127
01:48:07,898 --> 01:48:11,442
Gentlemen, our new CEO.

1128
01:48:11,610 --> 01:48:13,945
Marc Tourneuil.

1129
01:48:20,911 --> 01:48:23,580
Our main stockholders.

1130
01:48:25,541 --> 01:48:28,126
Marc, the President's advisors.

1131
01:48:36,719 --> 01:48:38,761
They expect a lot from you.

1132
01:48:44,852 --> 01:48:46,978
Tell them what they want to hear.

1133
01:48:50,941 --> 01:48:52,192
Thanks.

1134
01:48:58,115 --> 01:48:59,407
My friends...

1135
01:49:00,117 --> 01:49:02,285
I'm your modern Robin Hood.

1136
01:49:05,247 --> 01:49:08,041
We'll keep robbing the poor
to give to the rich!

1137
01:49:31,607 --> 01:49:33,483
They're children.

1138
01:49:33,651 --> 01:49:35,151
Grown-up children.

1139
01:49:36,612 --> 01:49:38,196
They're having fun.

1140
01:49:38,364 --> 01:49:41,115
They'll keep on having fun

1141
01:49:41,283 --> 01:49:43,243
until it all blows up.
