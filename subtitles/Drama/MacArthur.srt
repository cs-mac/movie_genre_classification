1
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,995
<i>As I was leaving</i>
<i>my hotel this morning,</i>

2
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,863
<i>the doorman asked me,</i>

3
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:18,130
<i>"Where are you</i>
<i>bound for, sir?"</i>

4
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:21,037
<i>When I replied,</i>
<i>"West Point"</i>

5
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:26,240
<i>he remarked,</i>
<i>"It's a beautiful place.</i>

6
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,349
<i>Have you ever</i>
<i>been there before?"</i>

7
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,321
Duty, Honor, Country.

8
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:50,535
Those three hallowed words
reverently dictate...

9
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:53,367
...what you ought to be,

10
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,737
what you can be...

11
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:58,038
...and what you will be.

12
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:01,080
<i>They are your</i>
<i>rallying points.</i>

13
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,741
<i>They give you</i>
<i>a temper of the will,</i>

14
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:06,478
a quality of
the imagination,

15
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:09,078
a vigor of
the emotions,

16
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:12,989
a freshness of
the deep springs of life,

17
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:17,723
a temperamental predominance
of courage over timidity,

18
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:20,789
an appetite
for adventure...

19
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,631
...over love of ease.

20
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:28,538
In this way, they will teach you
to be an officer...

21
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,542
...and a gentleman.

22
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,240
<i>From your ranks come the great</i>
<i>captains who will hold...</i>

23
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:38,113
<i>...the nation's destiny</i>
<i>in their hands...</i>

24
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:41,085
...the moment
the war tocsin sounds.

25
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:45,220
The Long Gray Line...

26
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,419
...has never failed us.

27
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:50,462
Were you to do so,

28
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,967
a million ghosts
in olive drab...

29
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:58,492
...and brown khaki,
in blue and gray...

30
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,267
...would rise from
their white crosses...

31
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,809
...thundering
those magic words:

32
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:08,176
Duty, Honor, Country!

33
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,512
This does not mean
that you are warmongers.

34
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:16,544
On the contrary, the soldier,
above all other people,

35
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:19,353
prays for peace,

36
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,916
for he must suffer
and bear...

37
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:25,761
...the deepest wounds
and scars of war.

38
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:32,928
<i>But always in our minds</i>
<i>ring the ominous words of Plato:</i>

39
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:37,308
<i>"Only the dead...</i>

40
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:41,336
<i>...have seen the end of war."</i>

41
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,531
Heads up, soldiers!

42
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,493
Heads up!

43
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,038
- Lieutenant?
- Yes, sir?

44
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:22,604
Major Huff's got himself wounded.
Would you look after him, please?

45
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,947
- Right away, sir.
- Corporal,
would you take this?

46
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,102
Major.

47
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:50,833
So, one of the Battling
Bastards of Bataan, eh?

48
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,869
Yes, sir. No Mama,
no Papa, no Uncle Sam.

49
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:57,142
Well, help
is on the way.

50
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:59,582
I have Washington's
solemn promise on that.

51
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,483
<i>General Marshall,</i>
<i>Admiral King,</i>

52
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,489
will you go
right in, please?

53
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,491
Thank you.

54
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,489
You said you wanted to talk
over the Corregidor problem.

55
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:15,466
I certainly do. I've gone out
on a limb with the Filipinos.

56
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:18,868
We should be getting more than
inspirational radio messages...

57
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,270
through the Japanese
blockade.

58
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,274
Have any of our ships
made it?

59
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:26,277
One ship has reached Mindanao,
two more made it to Cebu.

60
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:28,609
- The rest were either sunk
or captured.
- Thank you.

61
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:30,911
So far we've lost better
than 80,000 tons.

62
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,247
In other words, MacArthur has
received practically nothing.

63
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,253
That's about it,
Mr. President.

64
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,482
- <i>How long can they hold out?</i>
- Matter of weeks.

65
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:40,720
We're still dispatching submarines
to Bataan and Corregidor.

66
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,125
We managed to land
some munitions and drugs,

67
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,687
and evacuate a few of the
wounded, but that's all we can do.

68
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:49,496
Unless you wanna start stripping the defenses
of the West Coast, the Panama Canal...

69
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,163
One bombing of the canal and
it's out of action for two years.

70
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,968
It's a more vulnerable target, more
important target than Pearl Harbor.

71
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,532
And Hitler will have the whole North
American continent for a target...

72
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,044
- <i>...if we don't stop him in Europe.</i>
- Exactly.

73
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:02,478
But you know
what's going to happen.

74
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:06,040
Like everything else, Douglas is
going to take our strategy personally.

75
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:08,712
He thinks the blockade
is a figment of my imagination,

76
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:12,349
and that I'm somehow
deliberately robbing him of glory.

77
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:20,462
I wish you people would send
Douglas a globe of the world...

78
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,899
...to remind him we have
obligations all around it.

79
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,335
<i>We have to support Stalin...</i>

80
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:27,964
<i>...while he fights the bulk</i>
<i>of the Nazi army.</i>

81
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,908
We have to assist Churchill
to keep England functioning.

82
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:35,607
We have to protect our flanks,
the Panama Canal...

83
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:39,139
...and General Douglas
MacArthur.

84
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,788
I need him.
The country needs him.

85
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,051
We can't leave him
to the Japanese.

86
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:50,084
He won't leave the Philippines unless
you order him off, Mr. President.

87
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:58,870
Cut an order.
Put my name to it.

88
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:02,772
<i>L-O-5-O-6-7-3-D. L-9-2-6...</i>

89
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,776
<i>So long, baby.</i>

90
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:08,371
<i>That's 140 million bucks</i>
<i>the Japs won't get.</i>

91
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:10,381
<i>L-4-9-4...</i>

92
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,917
I'm army to the marrow
of my bones, Dick.

93
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:16,113
I've never disobeyed
an order in my life.

94
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:18,850
Now, for the first time,
I feel bound to disobey.

95
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:22,156
Sir, you couldn't.
You'd be court-martialed.

96
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,857
Then I'll resign my commission
and fight on here as a private.

97
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:29,265
I want you to direct a statement
for the president to that effect.

98
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,667
General, pardon me,
but you don't mean that.

99
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,570
I will not leave!
I'll stay here with my boys.

100
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,667
Sir, you are the only man alive
that can save the Philippines.

101
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:44,207
They would never have issued
an order to this effect...

102
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:48,151
unless they intended you to mount
an immediate counteroffensive.

103
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,248
Damn it, those convoys
they diverted,

104
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:54,987
the troops and supplies
that never got here...

105
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:57,996
...they're waiting for you
in Australia.

106
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:01,693
And if you leave now, you can
be back before the food runs out.

107
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:11,834
Sir, you cannot disobey
a presidential order.

108
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,984
The president.

109
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:35,967
Strange ways
destiny pulls men's lives.

110
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,471
We have to believe that,
don't we, Jack?

111
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,741
I can't even find
these supplies.

112
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,906
File that
goddamn requisition.

113
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,918
Yes, sir!

114
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:38,659
Major. Is the general
busy? The general busy?

115
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:41,894
You come and see.
He lead a big parade.

116
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:46,703
Excuse me, General.

117
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:50,970
The submarine has arrived to evacuate
President Quezon and his family, as you ordered.

118
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,136
- He still wants you
to join them.
- No, Sid.

119
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:03,216
Much more on the drums! Let's hear
those drums. Louder on the drums.

120
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:07,589
Sir, President Quezon is concerned
about your safety. He advises...

121
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,460
If a commander sneaks out, how
are the men supposed to feel?

122
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,226
I'll not skulk out of here
on a submarine.

123
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,827
I'll go in one of
Johnny Bulkeley's PT boats.

124
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:21,862
Sir, I know those boats.
Their engines are shot.

125
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,273
They'll only make
half-speed.

126
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:27,437
They're made of plywood. They've
got gasoline drums all over the deck.

127
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:30,539
They're like floating coffins.
They'll go up like a bomb.

128
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,550
At least put your family
on a submarine.

129
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,552
<i>They'd be safer there.</i>

130
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,284
No, Sid, no. I will
stay with the general.

131
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:41,553
- <i>Jean, you don't understand.</i>
- Come here.

132
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:44,687
We don't even know how many
Japanese are out there.

133
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:48,325
A submarine might be the only
safe place for you and Arthur.

134
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,233
We are staying with you.

135
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:54,830
- Don't forget those other
soiled clothes.
- Yes, ma'am.

136
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:08,711
Jeannie, Sid is right. It's
gonna be a very dangerous journey.

137
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,722
I'd rather have
you and Arthur...

138
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,623
Now, sir, as you are
so fond of saying,

139
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:16,991
"We three are one.
We drink of the same cup."

140
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,921
Jeannie.

141
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,398
You're my finest soldier.

142
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,447
How did Shakespeare put it?

143
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:39,040
"The general's wife
is the general's general."

144
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,673
Colonel Wainwright, sir?
General MacArthur's arriving.

145
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:07,837
Thank you, son.

146
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:13,010
There goes Dugout Doug and
his whole goddamn Gypsy caravan.

147
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,868
Good-bye, General, sir.

148
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:06,871
Castro, keep up
the good fight.

149
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,907
A guerrilla force
is forming.

150
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:10,532
- <i>I'm joining them.</i>
- Very good.

151
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,043
I've got my rifle.

152
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,046
- <i>Ammunition?</i>
- Enough.

153
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:19,050
All right, then.
Cross over to Bataan.

154
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,780
There are good men in
the hills there. Join them.

155
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,446
- <i>Fight with them.</i>
- Yes, sir.

156
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:27,925
Good luck, Castro.
We'll meet again.

157
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:44,103
Well, Jim,
I have no choice.

158
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,110
I know.

159
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,006
If we get through
to Australia,

160
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,074
I'll be back
as soon as I can...

161
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:55,382
...with as much
as I can.

162
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,946
- I suppose I can't convince you
to go by submarine.
- No, no, no.

163
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:01,959
If we can break through, it
will demonstrate to Washington...

164
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,757
...that this blockade
can be pierced...

165
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,264
...if you have
the daring for it.

166
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,268
In the meantime,

167
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:15,339
you've got to
hold on here.

168
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,341
Yes, sir.

169
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,531
Cigars, shaving cream.

170
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,069
Thank you.

171
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,798
Jim,

172
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:51,741
let the men know
that I'm obeying...

173
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,801
<i>...a direct order</i>
<i>from the president.</i>

174
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:56,040
<i>I will. I will.</i>

175
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:59,676
When I return,
I'll make you a lieutenant general.

176
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:02,653
I'll be here,
or I'll be dead.

177
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,723
Good-bye, Jim.
Good-bye.

178
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:21,701
- Welcome aboard, sir.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.

179
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:11,550
<i>I'm saying hello again</i>
<i>to you boys on Corregidor.</i>

180
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:14,956
<i>Especially you,</i>
<i>General MacArthur.</i>

181
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:19,555
<i>On behalf of the Japanese nation, allow me
to invite you to a party...</i>

182
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:22,498
<i>...to celebrate</i>
<i>our forthcoming victory.</i>

183
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,502
<i>A surprise party.</i>

184
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,403
<i>In fact, a necktie party,</i>
<i>here in Tokyo.</i>

185
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:30,567
Sorry, General.

186
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:33,406
Let's skip that
little party, shall we?

187
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,413
Aye, aye, sir.

188
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,535
What is it?

189
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,807
Mines.

190
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:16,100
I think that's
the last of them, sir.

191
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,599
There's a pot of hot
coffee up forward, sir.

192
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:52,303
- Would you like some?
- No coffee!

193
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:55,778
How do you feel,
sir?

194
00:21:57,282 --> 00:21:59,250
I'm not exactly
a navy man, Phil.

195
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:04,188
Well, when we get to Australia,
the commissioner of railways...

196
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:08,283
...has ordered his own personal car
for your trip to Melbourne.

197
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:14,326
Anything
I can do, sir?

198
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,334
Can't sleep.

199
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:21,731
We're safe.
They're doomed!

200
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:25,175
I know what
they're saying.

201
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:28,144
"Dugout Doug MacArthur
lies a-shakin' on the Rock,

202
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:32,081
safe from any danger
and any sudden shock."

203
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,084
I've heard that song.

204
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:37,781
Well, I'm sure that the men
who thought that one up...

205
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,654
...were just blowin'
off steam, sir.

206
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,325
I'm only thankful my father
isn't alive to hear it.

207
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:59,109
<i>Sir!</i>

208
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:30,372
I knew the train
would be the best.

209
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:33,206
This is the first time he's
really slept since Pearl Harbor.

210
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:35,212
Hmm.

211
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:55,325
Good crowd, and it looks like all the
Australian brass you want to talk to...

212
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,595
...are out there
waiting for you, sir.

213
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:00,399
All I see is people.
Where are the kangaroos?

214
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:03,134
I'm sure we'll see
some soon, dear.

215
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:11,142
<i>What I'd like to have is a public address system
by the back there.</i>

216
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:37,207
Hello, Dick.
Do you have a report for me?

217
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:41,837
Ah, yes, I do, but... but
there's a crowd waiting.

218
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:44,882
Why don't you go out, and
I'll brief you in the hotel.

219
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:50,147
Well, good news can wait,
bad news can't.

220
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:52,156
Let's have it.

221
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,461
Well, sir,

222
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,727
I, uh...

223
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,701
Nobody knows anything about
a Philippine relief expedition.

224
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,704
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

225
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:12,573
<i>In the whole of Australia, there is a
grand total of some 30,000 U.S. Personnel,</i>

226
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,874
<i>mostly artillery</i>
<i>and engineers,</i>

227
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:17,210
<i>scattered all over</i>
<i>the continent.</i>

228
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,715
<i>At present,</i>
<i>there's no American infantry.</i>

229
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:23,720
Air units?

230
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:27,417
There are about 250 planes
of all types...

231
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:29,551
...more or less
in commission.

232
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:32,062
Sixty-five of them
are undergoing repairs,

233
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,065
a hundred and twenty-two
of them are being assembled.

234
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:37,067
There's almost
no navy at all.

235
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,763
<i>And no infantry.</i>
<i>God help us.</i>

236
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:43,035
Well, there are approximately
300,000 Australian troops,

237
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:46,942
<i>but they've been described as</i>
<i>undertrained and underequipped.</i>

238
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:49,037
<i>You know what that means.</i>

239
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:53,551
<i>Not only is the Bataan rescue mission
so much blue sky over the horizon,</i>

240
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:57,076
it is even open to question
if we can defend Australia.

241
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:59,350
<i>MacArthur! MacArthur!</i>

242
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:01,619
- Ready to go, Daddy?
- Shh.

243
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:04,355
However, there is
one more thing, sir.

244
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:07,023
Headquarters here at
Melbourne has received...

245
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:10,067
...a message for you from
President Roosevelt.

246
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:14,463
He has awarded you
the Medal of Honor.

247
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,331
Congratulations,
sir.

248
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:21,209
<i>MacArthur!
MacArthur! MacArthur! MacArthur!</i>

249
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,407
<i>MacArthur! MacArthur!</i>
<i>MacArthur!</i>

250
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:29,579
<i>MacArthur! MacArthur!</i>
<i>MacArthur! MacArthur!</i>

251
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:32,088
Congressional Medal of Honor.

252
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:35,092
<i>MacArthur! MacArthur!</i>
<i>MacArthur!</i>

253
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,355
You know, my father...

254
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,626
...was awarded the same decoration
when he was only 19.

255
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,690
<i>MacArthur!</i>
<i>MacArthur!</i>

256
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,964
I had to wait
just a little bit longer.

257
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:49,803
<i>MacArthur! MacArthur!</i>
<i>MacArthur! MacArthur!</i>

258
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:55,304
But at this moment,

259
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:59,783
I would swap it
for just one trained division.

260
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:24,366
Excuse me, gentlemen. Would you
please shoot from a low angle?

261
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:26,433
The general likes
that effect very much.

262
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:33,942
The president
of the United States...

263
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:43,560
The president...

264
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:02,709
The president of the
United States ordered me...

265
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:05,341
to break through
the Japanese lines...

266
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:10,116
...and proceed from Corregidor
to Australia...

267
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,349
for the purpose
of organizing...

268
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:15,655
...the American offensive
against Japan,

269
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:18,218
a primary object of which...

270
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:21,231
...is the retaking
of the Philippines.

271
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:25,192
I came through...

272
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,670
...and I shall return.

273
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:39,679
<i>This is General</i>
<i>Wainwright speaking.</i>

274
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:42,117
<i>Subject: Surrender.</i>

275
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:46,624
<i>To put a stop to further</i>
<i>useless sacrifice of human life,</i>

276
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:48,625
<i>I've decided to accept,</i>

277
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:51,526
<i>in the name of humanity,</i>
<i>the formal surrender...</i>

278
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:55,396
<i>...of all American and Philippine</i>
<i>army troops...</i>

279
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,628
<i>...in the Philippine Islands.</i>

280
00:28:57,702 --> 00:29:02,571
<i>It became apparent that the garrisons
would be eventually destroyed.</i>

281
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,973
<i>This dissension</i>
<i>was forced upon me...</i>

282
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:09,343
<i>...by means entirely</i>
<i>beyond my control.</i>

283
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,406
<i>Let me emphasize there</i>
<i>must be no thought whatever...</i>

284
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:15,419
<i>...of disregarding</i>
<i>these instructions.</i>

285
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:19,014
<i>My assistant chief of staff</i>
<i>will repeat the complete text...</i>

286
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:23,550
<i>...of this letter by radio</i>
<i>to General MacArthur.</i>

287
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:26,062
<i>It's a trick!</i>
<i>It's a Japanese deception!</i>

288
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:28,895
No, sir. Everyone recognized
the general's voice.

289
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:32,368
He struck Old Glory
and ran up a bedsheet!

290
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:35,736
By what authority does he issue
such an unlawful order?

291
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,741
He's the acting commander.

292
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:40,778
The only possible explanation is
that he's temporarily deranged.

293
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:43,780
For that reason alone,
his orders have no validity.

294
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:47,181
I place no credence
on this alleged broadcast.

295
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:50,949
Everybody up there believed him, the
Japanese included! The conditions...

296
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:53,456
If it's true, then we
should get back at once.

297
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:56,153
It's not too late to join
the guerrillas on Luzon.

298
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:58,161
General, you-you
can't be serious.

299
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:00,424
They-they won't be
organized for months.

300
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:03,661
Now, we both know that Wainwright
could not hold on indefinitely.

301
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,794
He was not asked
to hold on indefinitely!

302
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:09,135
His job was to defend the
island until help arrived!

303
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:12,301
- That was his assignment.
- He had no supplies, no food left!

304
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:14,937
The malaria was
totally out of hand.

305
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:17,811
If he had tried to
hold out one more day,

306
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:20,282
we would've had
a dreadful massacre.

307
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,922
General, would...

308
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:44,706
Yes, yes, yes.

309
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:47,904
I suppose it was
just a matter of time.

310
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:53,246
- <i>General Blamey on line two, sir.</i>
- I can't speak to him now.

311
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:59,790
He'll call back later.

312
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:10,424
There's some talk
in Washington about...

313
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:13,095
...a Medal of Honor
for Wainwright.

314
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,530
They want you
to recommend it.

315
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:22,146
Medal of Honor?

316
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:29,811
If Wainwright
received it,

317
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:34,018
it would constitute an injustice
to others who have done far more.

318
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:43,590
Send the following radio
to General Marshall.

319
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:47,069
"I believe that Wainwright has
become temporarily unbalanced,

320
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:51,336
and that his condition renders
him susceptible of enemy use."

321
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:54,711
Unquote.

322
00:31:56,381 --> 00:32:00,818
<i>General, this training is well and good,
but it's not enough.</i>

323
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:05,254
<i>These troops are green corn!</i>
<i>They won't be ready for weeks!</i>

324
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:08,850
All soldiers are green
until their first battle.

325
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,361
Excuse me, I don't even
have the transport...

326
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,954
...to supply a single division
for 24 hours.

327
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:16,227
Hell, I can't even
land 'em on the beach.

328
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:19,828
Harding, I want action
from you, not complaints.

329
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:22,805
If I don't get going, the
navy's gonna win this war.

330
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:26,071
Look what Nimitz did up
at Coral Sea and Midway.

331
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:28,078
I know you don't have
everything you need.

332
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:30,080
Sir, if I could just have
a little more time...

333
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:32,082
That's because our
friends in Washington...

334
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,641
...are sending it all to George
Patton in North Africa,

335
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:37,688
so he can run around in the desert,
fighting a seesaw tank battle.

336
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:40,189
- If I could just have...
- Sid, I want to see my new air commander.

337
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,192
Where's General Kenney?

338
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:03,107
- General Kenney?
- <i>Good morning.</i>

339
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:05,547
<i>Where'd you get the B-17?</i>

340
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,584
It flew in from the States
this morning.

341
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,382
We're puttin' together several
squadrons up in Brisbane.

342
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,685
Good! How soon can you
get 'em in the air?

343
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:15,555
Soon enough to get
the enemy off our back,

344
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:18,322
<i>and maybe go kick his butt</i>
<i>for a change.</i>

345
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:21,695
Good, good! My boys say you can't do it.

346
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:23,757
Well, your boys
aren't fliers.

347
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,769
Give me five days
to prepare,

348
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:29,238
and I'll ship the whole goddamn United
States Army to New Guinea by air.

349
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:31,969
Really?

350
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:34,739
- My staff hear about this?
- I doubt it.

351
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:37,576
Don't tell 'em.
You'll scare 'em half to death!

352
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:39,582
Attack!

353
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:18,855
<i>And you ram it</i>
<i>right down his throat!</i>

354
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:22,791
The recent bombings of our northern
airfields give us every reason to believe...

355
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:28,765
...that the nips' next move will be a massive
invasion of the Australian continent.

356
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:31,563
The garrison at Darwin,
up here,

357
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:35,197
<i>doesn't have enough troops</i>
<i>to hold for more than 48 hours.</i>

358
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:39,266
So our best plan, therefore,
is to show token resistance...

359
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:43,370
...and fall back rapidly to this,
the Brisbane Line.

360
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:48,147
<i>To the north, the enemy</i>
<i>will find only burnt offerings.</i>

361
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:51,245
<i>Meanwhile in the southeast,</i>
<i>we will throw everything...</i>

362
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:55,418
<i>...into the fight for the cities</i>
<i>and the farmlands around them.</i>

363
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:58,291
This is the living heart
of Australia,

364
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:01,092
and we shall defend it
with our lives.

365
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:03,998
- General.
- Thank you.

366
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,404
Gentlemen,

367
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,975
I've been deeply moved...

368
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:14,068
...and deeply stirred...

369
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:17,637
...by the allied efforts,

370
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:20,309
and by the courage and
determination of the Australians...

371
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:23,751
<i>...as expressed by</i>
<i>General Blamey, but...</i>

372
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:27,621
as supreme commander of
the southwest Pacific area,

373
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:30,957
I will not be the leader
of another lost cause.

374
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:34,657
<i>We are attacking, gentlemen.</i>

375
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:37,997
I am going to make
the fight for Australia...

376
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:41,766
...up here in New Guinea.

377
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:54,443
<i>Hey, Joe,</i>
<i>whatcha doing out here?</i>

378
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:58,319
<i>You should be home on the farm</i>
<i>walking with your girl,</i>

379
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:01,620
<i>getting your chores done</i>
<i>and sitting down to supper.</i>

380
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:04,889
<i>Or maybe you should</i>
<i>be taking in a show,</i>

381
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:07,453
<i>walking down Broadway,</i>
<i>sipping Coke.</i>

382
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:11,896
<i>The jungle’s where we live.</i>
<i>It's where you die.</i>

383
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,039
<i>Bob, I sent for you...</i>

384
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:18,405
<i>...because I don't think you like a stalemate
any better than I do,</i>

385
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,910
<i>and that's what we've got</i>
<i>here in New Guinea.</i>

386
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:25,472
<i>They tell me that American boys are actually
throwing away their rifles and turning tail.</i>

387
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,018
<i>That hasn't happened since</i>
<i>the first battle of Bull Run.</i>

388
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:29,882
I want you
to relieve Harding.

389
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:32,582
This isn't
the Civil War, General.

390
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:35,091
Harding's a good man,
he's a good officer.

391
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:38,287
- It's just that he's up against...
- I'm sending you in, Bob.

392
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,626
I want you to remove
all officers who won't fight.

393
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:43,132
If necessary, put sergeants
in charge of battalions...

394
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,465
...and corporals in charge
of companies.

395
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,470
Anyone who will fight.

396
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,972
I want you to take Buna
or don't come back alive,

397
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,601
and that goes for
your chief of staff too.

398
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:57,947
Yes, sir.

399
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,818
Bob.

400
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:06,089
If you come through this
all right,

401
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:08,648
I'll give you
the Distinguished Service Cross,

402
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,422
I'll recommend you
for a high British decoration...

403
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:14,225
and I'll release your name
for newspaper publication.

404
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:19,135
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much, General.

405
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:32,672
I don't care how deep
the goddamn mud is!

406
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,083
I want you to kick ass,
or I'm gonna relieve yours!

407
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:44,423
Good news, General.
This battle is over.

408
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:47,464
It says so right here
in <i>Stars and Stripes.</i>

409
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:49,522
General MacArthur
won it yesterday.

410
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:54,094
Well, the great Sarah Bernhardt.
Another dramatic moment.

411
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:57,299
God, he tells
the newspapers,

412
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:59,969
but I wish he'd told
the Japanese.

413
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:02,410
Son of a bitch.
"Mopping-up operation"!

414
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,779
Now what kind of a phrase
is that to ask men to die for?

415
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:08,250
I'm surprised he didn't say
we're just policing the area.

416
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:12,085
- I wonder who really writes that
propaganda.
- <i>I don't know.</i>

417
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:15,455
I don't trust any of those ass
kissers up there at the H.Q.,

418
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:17,494
surroundin' MacArthur.

419
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:21,088
Hell, he doesn't have a staff,
he's got a court!

They remind me of
a bunch of barracuda...

422
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,939
...I used to play poker with
in Shanghai years ago.

423
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:31,236
We had to put the goddamn cuspidor
in the center of the table...

424
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,709
...because no one dared look away
long enough to spit!

425
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,338
- Where you off to?
- Gotta go to the latrine, sir.

426
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,351
But I shall return.

me, sir, but we just...

We just killed a Jap sniper
here not five minutes ago.

Fine, son. That's the

00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:49,807
Well, bombing Hansa Bay is
one thing. Taking it's another.

455
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,814
You can say
that again.

456
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:56,683
Well, let's just say
we won't take Hansa Bay.

457
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:58,688
We won't what?

458
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:02,749
That's it.
We don't want it.

459
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:06,194
General, the farther up the New Guinea
coast we go,

460
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:08,458
the more trouble
we're gonna run into.

461
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:10,864
And I hope you don't think it's
gonna be any easier at Wewak.

462
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:14,837
There's 60,000 of them holed up
there, sharpening their samurai swords.

463
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:17,635
Good. I hope
there's more.

464
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:19,801
We don't want
Wewak either.

465
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:22,607
We'll bypass
their strong points,

466
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,672
cut their supply lines and leave
'em to wither and die on the vine.

467
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:29,708
- But what about my men?
- Starve Hansa Bay. Starve Wewak.

468
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:32,813
<i>Starvation is my ally.</i>

469
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:35,890
<i>Okay, soldier,</i>
<i>welcome to the fight.</i>

470
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,929
<i>So the cut of the cards has dealt you
a tour of the Pacific.</i>

471
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,191
<i>What's it going to be like</i>
<i>fighting the nips,</i>

472
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:44,462
<i>and who is this man, Douglas MacArthur,
your new commander?</i>

473
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:47,595
<i>Let's take a look at the general</i>
<i>who in a few short months...</i>

474
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,196
<i>...has turned the tide</i>
<i>toward victory.</i>

475
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:52,674
Colonel Whitney! Yes.
We've been expecting you.

476
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:55,507
Welcome to New Guinea. Come in
out of the light. I'm so sorry.

477
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:58,070
That's all right. Please,
have a seat right over here.

478
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:01,709
Excuse me just a moment. I
have to watch this one section.

479
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,712
Okay, that's more like it.

480
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:13,553
I understand you're here to organize
Philippine guerrilla activity?

481
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,963
Yes, yes, that's right. But you
know, I've just come from Washington.

482
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,967
I must tell you
straight off,

483
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:21,198
you've done an absolutely topnotch
job on the general's press.

484
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:25,231
He's America's hero now, and no
small amount of credit belongs to you.

485
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:27,903
Well, we don't want the home
folks to forget about us out here.

486
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:32,108
Oh! I don't think you realize
the dimensions of the excitement.

487
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:34,946
Here. Letters from
congressmen, senators,

488
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,579
corporation executives,
even two governors.

489
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:39,953
And thousands of
just plain folks.

490
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:44,294
"You are big, B-I-G,

491
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:46,921
enough to do a complete
housecleaning...

492
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:49,022
<i>...of parasitic bureaucrats</i>
<i>in Washington.</i>

493
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:51,590
As long as the war is on, only
a military figure like yourself...

494
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:53,603
...can unseat the man
in the White House."

495
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:56,606
There's one from a lady in
New Jersey I want you to read.

496
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:59,905
- Excuse me a minute. I just want to
look at this closing.
- <i>Oh, sure.</i>

497
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:04,539
<i>Just remember, America's greatest combat general
will be leading you into battle.</i>

498
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:07,607
<i>"Hit 'em where they ain't."</i>
<i>That's his motto.</i>

499
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:10,381
<i>This is the MacArthur touch,</i>

500
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:12,945
<i>combining sea and air power</i>
<i>as never before,</i>

501
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:17,790
<i>he's leapfrogging right over the enemy's strongholds
to cut their chow line...</i>

502
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:21,126
<i>...all the way to the Philippines.</i>

503
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:24,599
<i>Now you get your chance to</i>
<i>fulfill the immortal pledge:</i>

504
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:29,230
<i>I came through,</i>
<i>and I shall return.</i>

505
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:34,110
Good!
Good!

506
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:37,079
Some exciting stuff there. Thank you.

507
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:39,138
Okay on this one
to Washington.

508
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:44,349
Wow! President MacArthur.
I like the sound of that.

509
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:46,651
Only question is,
how does it sound to MacArthur?

510
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:51,161
You know that I have
no political ambitions whatsoever.

511
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:55,324
General... General, this
country's always had a hero.

512
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:58,562
Washington, Lincoln,
Lindbergh.

513
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,570
Now you.

514
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:04,233
It's in all
the papers.

515
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:07,903
- The Republican ones.
- <i>No, sir.</i>
<i>Democratic ones too.</i>

516
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,969
Listen to this woman
in New Jersey.

517
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:14,814
She says,"I have never wanted to
sin with any other man in my life,

518
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:17,183
but I would with you."

519
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:19,245
How about it,
General?

520
00:44:21,725 --> 00:44:25,161
Uh-oh. Here's a little boy
in Moline, Illinois.

521
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:27,993
Wants to know,
"Why do you carry a cane?

522
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:30,397
<i>Are you feeble?"</i>

523
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:51,187
<i>General, what we want to do is</i>
<i>to print,"I shall return"...</i>

524
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:55,988
...on candy bars, matchbooks, chewing
gum, sewing kits and pencils,

525
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,823
and drop them on the
Philippines to boost morale.

526
00:44:57,895 --> 00:44:59,829
- First-rate idea.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

527
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:02,525
But back in Washington, the Office
of War Information wants to know if,

528
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,590
before things get going,

529
00:45:04,668 --> 00:45:06,602
<i>you'd be amenable to a small revision</i>
<i>of the wording.</i>

530
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,570
What sort of a revision?

531
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:12,598
Well, sir, they feel that "We
shall return" is more to the point.

532
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:16,043
- "We shall return?"
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

533
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:19,378
I fail to see what purpose
that would serve.

534
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:25,451
Why does Roosevelt
want me at Pearl Harbor?

535
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:27,456
What's he up to?

536
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:30,687
Why haven't I been told
what this is all about?

537
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:37,094
I'm perfectly willing to discuss strategy
with Admiral Nimitz, if that's what they want.

538
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:45,107
I suspect Roosevelt has been pulling
some strings to keep me in the dark.

539
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:50,238
You know, he's always
favored the navy.

540
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:19,742
That's our general.

541
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:23,712
And you should see the fire-engine
red car he just drove up in.

542
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:26,841
<i>Douglas MacArthur</i>
starring Douglas MacArthur.

543
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:30,318
He keeps me waiting half an hour, and
then he gets a bigger reception than I did.

544
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:32,321
Now I see what
Eisenhower meant.

545
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:35,586
He said he spent nine
long years with MacArthur...

546
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:37,957
...studying dramatics!

547
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:46,559
Excuse me, sir.
Would you look this way?

548
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,662
Keep talking
and act natural.

549
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,300
You're looking well, Douglas.
Tell me about your family.

550
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:56,608
Just fine, thank you,
Mr. President.

551
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:00,776
Sorry that I couldn't entertain
Eleanor when she was in Australia.

552
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:03,251
She enjoyed visiting
with Mrs. MacArthur.

553
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:07,051
You, as I recall, were
out of town fighting a war.

554
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:13,125
Oh, and, Douglas, before
we get down to business,

555
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:16,963
I'd like to take this opportunity
to present you with a decoration.

556
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:21,300
The Order of Merit for
Conspicuous Inspiration...

557
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:23,362
...of the American People.

558
00:47:32,382 --> 00:47:36,182
General MacArthur, we have asked you
here because the Joint Chiefs of Staff...

559
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:39,711
...have been considering for about
a year, without a decision,

560
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:42,759
the next step to be taken
in the Pacific war.

561
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:46,057
The president has decided he
would like to hear firsthand...

562
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:49,360
...the views of his commanders
in chief in the field.

563
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:53,460
Admiral Nimitz, would you please present
the plan prepared by you and Admiral King.

564
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,630
Yes, sir.

565
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:58,607
In our westward drive
across the Pacific,

566
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:01,007
the navy's
consistent goal...

567
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:04,445
...has been to cut Japan's
line of communication.

568
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:06,948
Now, as you know, the central
Pacific offensives...

569
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:11,784
<i>...have taken under control the Gilbert, the Marshall,
and the Mariana Island groups.</i>

570
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:15,416
<i>In our view, the sound strategy</i>
<i>for early victory...</i>

571
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:19,952
<i>...is to occupy the western Pacific</i>
<i>and seize Formosa,</i>

572
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:22,362
<i>both to control</i>
<i>the Formosa Strait...</i>

573
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:25,265
<i>...and as a jumping-off point</i>
<i>against Japan.</i>

574
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:28,964
Now, this means bypassing...

575
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:31,633
...the main Philippine island
of Luzon...

576
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:34,142
<i>...until Formosa is secured.</i>

577
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:36,941
<i>After General MacArthur's</i>
<i>troops...</i>

578
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:39,414
...have seized
the southern Philippines,

579
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:42,611
the access of advance that
should get the highest priority...

580
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:45,780
<i>...is the central Pacific offensive</i>
<i>toward Formosa.</i>

581
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:49,189
<i>General MacArthur</i>
<i>could then move into Luzon...</i>

582
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:53,059
<i>...and recapture Manila after</i>
<i>my forces have taken Formosa.</i>

583
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:56,827
In fact,
with the fall of Japan,

584
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,061
the liberation
of the northern Philippines,

585
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:01,127
<i>including Manila,</i>

586
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:04,173
<i>will follow de facto, without</i>
<i>any need for force of arms.</i>

587
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:07,574
We therefore propose
to invade Formosa...

588
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:10,010
...at the earliest
opportunity.

589
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,310
And my planners
are convinced...

590
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:15,943
...that a target date
of March 1, '45,

591
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:17,953
is not unreasonable.

592
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:23,016
<i>Well, Douglas,</i>
<i>how does it sound to you?</i>

593
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:34,964
I'm a soldier, and I'll
hold the horse if so ordered.

594
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:40,170
To bypass isolated islands
is one thing,

595
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:42,973
but to leave
in your rear...

596
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:46,812
...250,000
Japanese troops...

597
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:49,511
...drawing their sustenance
from the Philippines,

598
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:52,612
<i>involves serious</i>
<i>and unnecessary risks.</i>

599
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:56,056
From Luzon,
I can clamp a blockade...

600
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:59,118
...on all supplies
from the south to Japan,

601
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:02,029
thus forcing her
to an early capitulation.

602
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:04,727
Therefore, I propose...

603
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:07,861
...that we land
at Leyte Beach on Luzon,

604
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:10,498
and then carry
the fight to Manila.

605
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:14,533
Given a successful landing, aren't you
afraid of a long and bloody campaign?

606
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:18,069
With the kind of
performance and support...

607
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:21,242
...provided thus far
by the navy,

608
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:23,252
I can be in Manila
in five weeks...

609
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,380
...from the day my troops
step ashore on the beaches,

610
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:28,390
<i>and well before</i>
<i>next March.</i>

611
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:30,926
General, how can
you say that?

612
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:34,122
Because for two years, Filipino
guerrillas have been working...

613
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:38,258
...behind the Japanese lines to
set the stage for our landings.

614
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:41,862
It's your position to know, but I can't
conscientiously agree with this estimate.

615
00:50:41,938 --> 00:50:45,339
To take Luzon would demand
heavier losses than we can stand.

616
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:47,343
It seems to me
we should bypass it.

617
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:50,141
In my two years of fighting
in the southwest Pacific area,

618
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:52,147
and they have been
long, hard years,

619
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:56,709
fewer Americans have been killed
than in the single battle of Anzio.

620
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:59,551
<i>The days of the frontal</i>
<i>attack are over.</i>

621
00:50:59,623 --> 00:51:02,649
Only your mediocre
commanders use it.

622
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:06,355
Your good commanders
do not turn in heavy losses.

623
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:10,924
<i>Douglas, Admiral Nimitz's victories
have been no less than your own.</i>

624
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:14,562
Franklin, all the years
we've known each other,

625
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:18,836
I don't believe I told you how
my father won his Medal of Honor.

626
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:21,901
No, you never did. But you're
about to do it now, aren't you?

627
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:26,812
It was during the Battle
of Missionary Ridge.

628
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:29,477
At the height of the fighting,
he saw the flag go down.

629
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:32,181
As others around him faltered,
he seized up the colors...

630
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,485
...and rallied
the troops to victory.

631
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:40,357
Admiral Nimitz is one
of our greatest admirals.

632
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:44,491
But just now,
as I listened to the plan,

633
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:47,401
I thought I saw our flag
going down.

634
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:50,235
Oh, did you?

635
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:52,935
<i>Mr. President,</i>
<i>had we the will to do so,</i>

636
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:56,672
we could have saved Bataan and
Corregidor in the first place!

637
00:51:56,746 --> 00:52:00,443
To sacrifice Luzon a second time
cannot be condoned or forgiven.

638
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:02,485
My dear General,

639
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:05,521
bypassing Luzon is not
synonymous with sacrificing...

640
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:10,458
But bypassing Luzon has implications
which stain American honor.

641
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:14,827
<i>Do you realize what the Japanese propagandists are
telling the Filipino people?</i>

642
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:16,889
That Americans will never
shed their blood...

643
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:19,492
...to save the colored peoples
of the earth!

644
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:21,969
Your zeal is understandable.
I admire it.

645
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:24,871
But we can't
let it interfere...

646
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:27,375
<i>...with a workable</i>
<i>Pacific strategy.</i>

647
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:37,051
"I give to the Philippines
my solemn pledge...

648
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:40,055
...that their freedom
will be redeemed.

649
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:43,524
<i>Entire resources of men and material
of the United States...</i>

650
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:45,618
...stand behind that pledge."

651
00:52:47,063 --> 00:52:50,123
Your words, sir.

652
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,404
<i>Mr. President,</i>

653
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:58,032
General MacArthur's points
are well taken,

654
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:02,545
and I'm sure that the Joint Chiefs will
wish to consider them very carefully.

655
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:04,546
I shall return.

656
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:08,380
I am going back there next fall
if I have to paddle a canoe.

657
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:12,820
<i>If your decision be to bypass Luzon with
its millions of people,</i>

658
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:15,881
thousands of American
prisoners of war,

659
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:19,986
to continue to languish there
in agony and despair,

660
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:25,061
I daresay that the American
public would be so aroused...

661
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:29,970
...that they would register complete resentment
against you at the polls next fall.

662
00:53:34,144 --> 00:53:37,602
Arthur!
Arthur Prettyman!

663
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:41,845
<i>Get me an aspirin tablet.</i>
<i>No, no, make it two.</i>

664
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:46,981
Nobody can talk me into a headache
the way General MacArthur can.

665
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:50,288
Gentlemen, I think
it's time to call a recess.

666
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,158
- It's been a fatiguing day.
- Indeed it has, sir.

667
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,892
Recess was my favorite time
in school.

668
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:58,400
It's getting
to be that way in war.

669
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:05,404
- Douglas.
- Yes, Mr. President?

670
00:54:05,475 --> 00:54:08,137
Why haven't you come home
all these years?

671
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:11,669
Well, I've had
my hands full out here.

672
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:16,047
The country
has evolved,

673
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:18,053
grown mature.

674
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:20,646
Change is inevitable,
you know.

675
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:24,988
The things I value
never change.

676
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:28,690
My only regret is that my son
has never seen his country.

677
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,858
He's never been home.

678
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:33,892
Where is that
for you?

679
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:38,396
Well, in a sense,
the army is home.

680
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:41,739
Even my swaddling clothes
were khaki.

681
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:47,575
Mainly I...

682
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:49,915
I think of West Point
as home.

683
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:52,147
<i>The lecture halls,</i>

684
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:54,850
<i>the football fields</i>
<i>where I became a man.</i>

685
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:57,722
And I...

686
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:02,060
I also see a terrace
overlooking Manila Bay.

687
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,396
Yes, the Philippines
are also home.

688
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:09,437
I appreciate and understand
your feelings, Douglas.

689
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:14,273
Now, I shall inform
the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

690
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:18,371
upon my return home, that I
have had two excellent briefings.

691
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:21,315
I'm sure they'll be
both pleased and delighted.

692
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:23,682
And I shall ask them to make
their decision promptly.

693
00:55:24,788 --> 00:55:26,813
Thank you.

694
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:30,121
I'd like to return to my command
as soon as possible.

695
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:32,684
For 40 years,
I've held a firm conviction...

696
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:35,731
...that a commander's place
is at the scene of the battle.

697
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:37,960
<i>I agree with you</i>
<i>entirely, Douglas.</i>

698
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:40,400
That is why I am here.

699
00:55:49,913 --> 00:55:53,007
<i>"Southwest Pacific forces...</i>

700
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:55,347
<i>...to invade Leyte.</i>

701
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:01,584
<i>Target date</i>
<i>advanced to 20 October."</i>

702
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:04,058
<i>Hot damn, we got it!</i>

703
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:06,061
<i>This'll make</i>
<i>the old man happy.</i>

704
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:09,098
<i>He'll be returning to the Philippines two months
earlier than he expected.</i>

705
00:56:09,165 --> 00:56:11,599
Sergeant, I want you to get this
out immediately, if not sooner,

706
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:13,602
to all top command
headquarters.

707
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:55,543
Good morning, sir.
Good morning, General.

708
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:58,012
Earplugs, sir.
Thank you.

709
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:03,183
Good morning, Mr. President.
Good morning, General.

710
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:06,916
President Osmeña, earplugs
for your ears. Thank you.

711
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:09,843
I hope to hell they do as well on
the beaches as they did in training.

712
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:12,285
I don't think you have to
worry about that, General.

713
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:14,653
I know the 5th Cavalry.

714
00:58:14,724 --> 00:58:18,626
<i>When I was a little boy, my father was a captain
at Fort Selden,</i>

715
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:21,391
New Mexico territory.

716
00:58:21,464 --> 00:58:25,628
Geronimo, the Apache scourge,
was on the loose,

717
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:29,729
and it was a troop from this same 5th
Cavalry that rode through to help us.

718
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:32,775
<i>They fought then.</i>
<i>They'll fight now.</i>

719
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:35,610
<i>And they'll win.</i>

720
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:43,318
<i>Look at that, Mr. President.</i>

721
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:46,253
The second wave
is going in upright.

722
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:49,416
Our intelligence reports said the
Japanese wouldn't let us on the beach.

723
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:53,758
<i>But just look at those boys!</i>
<i>Nothing will stop them!</i>

724
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:32,334
Where's my landing craft?
I'm going ashore.

725
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,927
I had it delayed, sir. Heavy
enemy mortar fire on the beach.

726
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:37,199
I felt it was unsafe for
the commander in chief...

727
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:40,709
The landing craft,
Captain. Aye, aye, sir.

728
01:00:01,998 --> 01:00:04,694
President Osmeña,
you're home at last.

729
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:13,842
Follow me.

730
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:17,175
Correspondents, please stay in the rear
until after the general makes his statement.

731
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:20,613
No questions... Gerry, where
are you going with that?

732
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:23,117
<i>I'm gonna get a better shot</i>
<i>down the beach, sir.</i>

733
01:00:23,186 --> 01:00:27,054
I want that camera where it was. I wanna
see that wreckage in the background.

734
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:30,559
The general will think
this smoke is marvelous!

735
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,561
Get back.
Correspondents, back.

736
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,563
Low angle, remember.

737
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:43,067
Right over there.
Stay.

738
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:51,046
You see, General,

739
01:00:51,114 --> 01:00:54,641
my people are going to laugh
if I fell in deep water.

740
01:00:54,717 --> 01:00:58,483
- I cannot swim!
- That's not so bad, Mr. President.

741
01:00:58,554 --> 01:01:01,955
Everyone's about to see
that I can't walk on water.

742
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:49,129
People of the Philippines,

743
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:52,933
I have returned.

744
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:57,537
By the grace
of Almighty God,

745
01:01:57,613 --> 01:02:01,208
our forces
stand again...

746
01:02:01,284 --> 01:02:03,616
...on Philippine soil.

747
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:08,287
The hour of your
redemption is here.

748
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:10,291
<i>Rally to me.</i>

749
01:02:10,359 --> 01:02:12,293
<i>Let the indomitable spirit...</i>

750
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:16,991
<i>...of Bataan and Corregidor</i>
<i>lead on.</i>

751
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:20,399
As the lines of battle
roll forward,

752
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:22,995
rise and strike...

753
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:26,041
<i>...for your homes and hearts.</i>

754
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:28,100
<i>Strike...</i>

755
01:02:28,177 --> 01:02:30,236
<i>...for future generations...</i>

756
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:32,975
<i>...of your sons and daughters.</i>

757
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:36,314
<i>Strike in the name...</i>

758
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:38,512
...of your sacred dead.

759
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:42,991
Strike!
Let no heart be faint.

760
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:46,426
Let every arm be steel!

761
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:51,399
The divine guidance of God
points the way.

762
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:57,269
Follow in His name to the Holy
Grail of righteous victory!

763
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:09,650
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!</i>
<i>Hold it! Hold it!</i>

764
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:12,654
General, sir, you've
arrived at the front lines.

765
01:03:12,722 --> 01:03:16,055
Well, I see our boys
fully 100 yards up ahead.

766
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:19,390
Sir, that's only a forward patrol.
The men are under enemy fire.

767
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:23,398
You'd be in extreme hazard if
you go on up past this point.

768
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,457
There's Japs
right up there.

769
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:28,129
You can't fight 'em
if you can't see 'em, son.

770
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:30,138
Let's go.

771
01:03:34,777 --> 01:03:36,711
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

772
01:03:36,779 --> 01:03:39,748
That's the first time I've ever seen
a commander in chief take the point.

773
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:44,518
Yeah, he's the greatest
general since Sergeant York.

774
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:04,932
Cease fire!
Cease fire!

775
01:04:06,275 --> 01:04:08,209
Come on.

776
01:04:08,277 --> 01:04:10,211
<i>Will you look at him?</i>

777
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:12,213
Does he really think
that he can't get hurt?

778
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:15,148
Goddamn it,
of course he does!

779
01:04:15,218 --> 01:04:17,880
I've got a little surprise
for the general.

780
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:23,083
- Morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, sir.

781
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,128
<i>Sir,</i>

782
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:28,129
pursuant to
an act of Congress,

783
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,722
you have been promoted to the
rank of General of the Army.

784
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:34,793
Such promotion to take
effect 18 December, 1944,

785
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,805
by order of
the president.

786
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:40,809
Sir, we thought that you should
get these on as soon as you can.

787
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:46,079
<i>You got your fifth</i>
<i>star, General.</i>

788
01:04:46,148 --> 01:04:50,141
Well, I have no objections.
I like the look of 'em.

789
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:52,983
- Congratulations, sir.
- Thank you, Court.

790
01:04:58,494 --> 01:05:00,462
<i>I think it would</i>
<i>be a good idea...</i>

791
01:05:00,529 --> 01:05:03,794
...to take that mortar out
before someone gets hurt.

792
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:40,861
Follow me. Come around
so we can get the general.

793
01:05:50,413 --> 01:05:53,541
So good to see you, General.
Finally returned, but a little late.

794
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:57,143
- So good to see you.
- Thank you.

795
01:05:58,921 --> 01:06:01,355
Get me some more shots
of these people.

796
01:06:05,528 --> 01:06:08,964
- Hello, sonny.
- Aah.

797
01:06:09,031 --> 01:06:12,091
You know, I've got a boy at home
just about your size.

798
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:14,932
I have.
Here we are.

799
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:16,835
<i>Nice going, General.</i>

800
01:06:16,906 --> 01:06:19,340
Survivors of the
death march are in here.

801
01:06:39,795 --> 01:06:42,127
General, you really
made it back.

802
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,291
Oh, I'm never gonna
forget this.

803
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:49,031
- We're long overdue, sir.
Long overdue.
- It's okay.

804
01:06:49,105 --> 01:06:52,802
- We knew you'd come back, sir. We knew
you wouldn't forget us.
- Thank you.

805
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:54,809
We're a little late.
I'm sorry.

806
01:06:54,877 --> 01:06:58,005
<i>Colonel Fox here, sir.</i>
<i>We're sure glad to see you, sir.</i>

807
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,344
- We're a little late.
I'm sorry.
- Yes, sir.

808
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:02,475
<i>General?</i>
<i>General?</i>

809
01:07:02,551 --> 01:07:05,019
<i>General?</i>

810
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:07,146
<i>Thank God you're here.</i>

811
01:07:07,223 --> 01:07:09,851
We're long overdue.
Long overdue.

812
01:07:26,642 --> 01:07:30,134
- Pedro!
- Yes, sir.

813
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:32,578
I'm sorry I'm so
unpresentable, sir.

814
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:48,795
You never looked
so good to me, Castro.

815
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:12,520
Ladies and gentlemen,

816
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:14,681
if you've ever had
a load of hay fall on you,

817
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:17,191
then you know
how I feel right now.

818
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:21,218
I don't know if any of you pray, but if
you do, you could pray God to help me.

819
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:25,194
<i>Good luck, Mr. President.</i>

820
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:27,201
I wish you didn't
have to call me that.

821
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:29,533
I never felt so out of place
in all my life.

822
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:34,008
<i>Here is the caisson</i>
<i>of Franklin Delano Roosevelt,</i>

823
01:08:34,076 --> 01:08:37,204
<i>now making the turn</i>
<i>off of 15th Street...</i>

824
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:39,713
<i>...into Pennsylvania Avenue.</i>

825
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:42,580
<i>God give me strength</i>
<i>to do this.</i>

826
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:47,586
<i>And there is</i>
<i>the flag-draped coffin.</i>

827
01:08:47,656 --> 01:08:52,684
<i>The horses with black blankets</i>
<i>under their saddles.</i>

828
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:55,286
<i>The horses</i>
<i>on the right side,</i>

829
01:08:55,364 --> 01:08:57,798
<i>unmounted.</i>

830
01:08:57,867 --> 01:09:00,358
<i>And it's moving</i>
<i>ever so slowly...</i>

831
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:03,496
<i>...as the crowd stands...</i>

832
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:06,234
<i>...to pay their</i>
<i>last respects...</i>

833
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:10,039
<i>...to the man who was their leader,</i>
<i>their commander in chief,</i>

834
01:09:10,112 --> 01:09:12,046
<i>their friend.</i>

835
01:09:14,116 --> 01:09:17,381
Mr. President.
Hello, General.

836
01:09:17,453 --> 01:09:20,445
We need your authorization.
What have you got?

837
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:29,864
Well, the President...

838
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:35,436
Mr. Roosevelt
never told me.

839
01:09:35,938 --> 01:09:37,701
They never told me.

840
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:42,705
We spent months
of staff time,

841
01:09:42,778 --> 01:09:45,246
tens of millions of dollars
in preparation...

842
01:09:45,314 --> 01:09:47,305
...for the greatest invasion
in history,

843
01:09:47,383 --> 01:09:50,318
and when we're
primed and ready,

844
01:09:50,386 --> 01:09:52,786
they send
an air force officer...

845
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:57,292
...to tell me they've constructed
this-this apparatus!

846
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:00,123
General, what happens
if it doesn't work?

847
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:04,728
What happens
if it does?

848
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:44,597
Yes?

849
01:10:44,673 --> 01:10:46,607
Excuse me.

850
01:10:46,675 --> 01:10:49,075
Admiral Halsey, the representatives
are all on board, sir.

851
01:10:49,144 --> 01:10:52,910
The British commander of Singapore has
just been released from a prison camp.

852
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:55,712
Percival. Good, good. What
about that Russian fellow?

853
01:10:55,784 --> 01:10:57,775
General Derevyanko.
He's here.

854
01:10:57,853 --> 01:10:59,787
What gall!

855
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:03,347
The Soviets declared war after we'd won it,
and now they want to horn in on the surrender.

856
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:06,394
There's someone else
here too, sir.

857
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,874
General.

858
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:34,555
Jim.

859
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:37,882
- <i>General.</i>
- Jim!

860
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:42,326
I'm so glad to see you.

861
01:11:51,006 --> 01:11:54,066
General Wainwright, I don't
think you know Admiral Halsey.

862
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:56,475
- Welcome aboard, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

863
01:11:56,545 --> 01:11:58,809
- Jonathan. Good to see you.
- Yes, of course.

864
01:11:58,881 --> 01:12:00,815
<i>And Admiral Nimitz.</i>

865
01:12:00,883 --> 01:12:02,748
- General.
- Admiral.

866
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:04,809
Come and sit down,
Jim.

867
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:08,321
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't talk like that.

868
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:12,793
- I've disgraced you and the army.
- You have not. That's not true.

869
01:12:12,861 --> 01:12:16,024
- We were starving.
- You don't have to say anything, Jim.

870
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:19,499
I had to shoot my horse.

871
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:23,670
I realize they'll never
restore me to active duty.

872
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:27,175
That's not true, Jim. You
can have whatever you want.

873
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:34,607
Command of a corps.
That's all I want.

874
01:12:36,251 --> 01:12:40,950
Your old corps is yours
whenever you're ready, General.

875
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:22,263
- Sid.
- <i>Yes, sir?</i>

876
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:24,891
What did I do
with Jean's pen?

877
01:13:24,967 --> 01:13:26,901
Here we go, sir.

878
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:44,151
<i>We are gathered here,</i>

879
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:46,210
<i>representatives</i>
<i>of the major warring powers,</i>

880
01:13:46,288 --> 01:13:52,022
to conclude this solemn agreement
where by peace may be restored.

881
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:56,497
The issues have been determined
upon the battlefields of the world...

882
01:13:56,565 --> 01:14:01,025
...and hence are not
for our discussion or debate.

883
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:04,766
<i>The representative</i>
<i>of the emperor of Japan,</i>

884
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:07,741
<i>and of the Japanese Imperial</i>
<i>general headquarters,</i>

885
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:11,211
<i>now sign</i>
<i>the instrument of surrender.</i>

886
01:14:12,881 --> 01:14:16,942
<i>General Sutherland, will you show him
where to sign, please?</i>

887
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:58,785
<i>The supreme commander</i>
<i>of the Allied powers...</i>

888
01:14:58,861 --> 01:15:03,560
<i>...will now sign on behalf of all the nations
at war with Japan.</i>

889
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:17,845
Will Generals Percival and
Wainwright come forward, please?

890
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:14,230
The representative of the United
States of America will now sign.

891
01:16:17,506 --> 01:16:20,873
<i>The representative of the Republic of China
will now sign.</i>

892
01:16:20,943 --> 01:16:24,379
<i>The representative of the United Kingdom
will now sign.</i>

893
01:16:24,446 --> 01:16:26,971
<i>The representative of Canada</i>
<i>will now sign.</i>

894
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:29,176
<i>The representative</i>
<i>of France...</i>

895
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:31,742
<i>The representative of Australia</i>
<i>will now sign.</i>

896
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:34,084
<i>The representative of the Netherlands
will now sign.</i>

897
01:16:34,156 --> 01:16:36,818
<i>The representative of New Zealand
will now sign.</i>

898
01:16:36,892 --> 01:16:39,884
<i>The representative of the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics...</i>

899
01:16:39,962 --> 01:16:41,896
<i>...will now sign.</i>

900
01:16:43,865 --> 01:16:46,595
Today...

901
01:16:46,668 --> 01:16:48,602
...the guns are silent.

902
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:51,571
A great tragedy
has ended.

903
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,574
I speak...

904
01:16:53,642 --> 01:16:57,203
...for the thousands of silent lips
forever stilled...

905
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:59,213
...among the jungles
and the beaches...

906
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:01,647
...and in the deep waters
of the Pacific...

907
01:17:01,717 --> 01:17:03,685
...which marked the way.

908
01:17:03,752 --> 01:17:05,686
I pray...

909
01:17:05,754 --> 01:17:08,621
<i>...that an omnipotent</i>
<i>Providence...</i>

910
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:10,885
<i>...will summon</i>
<i>all persons of goodwill...</i>

911
01:17:10,959 --> 01:17:15,089
<i>...to the realization</i>
<i>of the utter futility of war.</i>

912
01:17:15,163 --> 01:17:20,226
We have known
the bitterness of defeat,

913
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:24,534
the exultation of triumph,
and from both we have learned...

914
01:17:24,606 --> 01:17:27,336
...that there can be
no turning back.

915
01:17:27,409 --> 01:17:31,106
We must go forward
to preserve in peace...

916
01:17:31,179 --> 01:17:33,272
...what we won in war.

917
01:17:33,348 --> 01:17:37,079
<i>The destructiveness</i>
<i>of the war potential...</i>

918
01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:40,019
<i>...through progressive advances</i>
<i>in scientific discovery...</i>

919
01:17:40,088 --> 01:17:42,955
<i>...has in fact</i>
<i>now reached a point...</i>

920
01:17:43,025 --> 01:17:47,689
<i>...which revises</i>
<i>the traditional concept of war.</i>

921
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:50,764
War...

922
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:54,233
...the most
malignant scourge...

923
01:17:54,302 --> 01:17:56,770
...and greatest sin
of mankind...

924
01:17:56,838 --> 01:18:02,140
...can no longer be controlled,
only abolished.

925
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:09,376
We are in a new era.

926
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:11,681
If we do not devise...

927
01:18:11,753 --> 01:18:14,517
...some greater
and more equitable means...

928
01:18:14,589 --> 01:18:17,649
...of settling disputes
between nations...

929
01:18:18,627 --> 01:18:21,755
...Armageddon will be
at our door.

930
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:29,262
We have had
our last chance.

931
01:18:45,587 --> 01:18:48,886
<i> Court, I want you to tell Washington
that I'm transferring food...</i>

932
01:18:48,957 --> 01:18:51,152
<i>...and medical supplies</i>
<i>to the Japanese authorities.</i>

933
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:55,322
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>
- The next priority is to get those men home,

934
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:57,490
get them to work
rebuilding this country.

935
01:18:57,566 --> 01:18:59,500
I don't know.

936
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:02,867
In terms of communication, transport,
industrial plant, there isn't any country.

937
01:19:02,938 --> 01:19:05,532
Yeah, well, they'll have
to build a new one.

938
01:19:05,607 --> 01:19:08,804
<i>A new Japan</i>
<i>with new ideas...</i>

939
01:19:08,877 --> 01:19:11,937
- <i>...but preserving the best of the old.</i>
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

940
01:19:12,013 --> 01:19:14,607
All of our troops
will be judged by me...

941
01:19:14,683 --> 01:19:17,243
...for their conduct as men
and as soldiers.

942
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:19,310
I want them to understand
that the Japanese...

943
01:19:19,387 --> 01:19:22,754
...must be treated
with courtesy and respect.

944
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:26,487
Alexander,
Caesar, Napoleon...

945
01:19:26,561 --> 01:19:29,189
...all failed as occupiers
of conquered countries...

946
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:31,858
...because of the harshness
of their policies.

947
01:19:33,235 --> 01:19:35,169
I do not intend to fail.

948
01:19:35,237 --> 01:19:37,467
We're coming up
on the palace now.

949
01:19:39,074 --> 01:19:41,008
<i>I wonder whether</i>
<i>it wouldn't be a good idea...</i>

950
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:43,135
<i>...to summon the emperor</i>
<i>to explain your policies.</i>

951
01:19:43,211 --> 01:19:45,202
Show of authority
to the Japanese people.

952
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:48,909
No. After a lifetime
of studying the Oriental mind,

953
01:19:48,984 --> 01:19:53,114
I can tell you that I must not
directly challenge...

954
01:19:53,188 --> 01:19:55,247
...the authority
of the emperor.

955
01:19:55,323 --> 01:19:59,953
He lives there in that palace across
that moat, half god, half king.

956
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:03,293
<i>His decrees limit the degree</i>
<i>of each man's freedom.</i>

957
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:05,492
His word is absolute.

958
01:20:06,935 --> 01:20:09,768
The time will come when
Hirohito, of his own volition,

959
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:12,238
will cross that moat
and come to me,

960
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:14,332
and that will mark
the beginning of the end...

961
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:16,775
...of his absolute power
over the Japanese people.

962
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:41,928
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Court.

963
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:45,097
Morning, gentlemen. I've been going
over these additional suggestions...

964
01:20:45,173 --> 01:20:47,801
...from the State Department
on the occupation.

965
01:20:47,876 --> 01:20:51,573
I have to work them in with our
own task force recommendations.

966
01:20:51,646 --> 01:20:54,171
General Marquat, what's
happening with land reform?

967
01:20:54,249 --> 01:20:56,979
The landowners are having
difficulty with their tenant farmers.

968
01:20:57,052 --> 01:21:01,853
Oh, they are? I don't want to ever
hear the word "tenant farmer" again.

969
01:21:01,923 --> 01:21:04,824
I want these privileged landowners
stripped of their holdings.

970
01:21:04,893 --> 01:21:07,521
- We'll break up these great estates.
- Yes, sir, but...

971
01:21:07,596 --> 01:21:10,258
They've been squeezing the
farmers dry far too long.

972
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:14,635
But, sir, they're
very strong.

973
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:17,228
They may not be
as strong as they think.

974
01:21:17,305 --> 01:21:21,742
And the right-wing industrialists are
the fellows who led this country to ruin.

975
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:23,801
I want them expunged.

976
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:26,609
<i>Expunged, sir?</i>
<i>Don't you think that you...</i>

977
01:21:26,681 --> 01:21:29,275
All in the best possible
legal language, of course.

978
01:21:31,786 --> 01:21:34,812
I want to see a labor
movement take root.

979
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:37,290
- Labor movement?
- That's right.

980
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:41,090
The workers must have a strong
voice in the means of production.

981
01:21:41,162 --> 01:21:45,758
General, pardon me, but this
reminds me somewhat of...

982
01:21:45,834 --> 01:21:48,667
- Well, it's like...
- Like what?

983
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:50,932
Like the New Deal.

984
01:21:52,674 --> 01:21:56,872
Ah. Well, this is Japan,
not America.

985
01:21:56,945 --> 01:21:59,209
But considering
her fascist past...

986
01:21:59,281 --> 01:22:03,047
...it might be good to move her just a
little left of center, don't you agree?

987
01:22:03,118 --> 01:22:05,450
- Yes, sir.
- Of course, we
wouldn't call it the New Deal.

988
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,454
No, sir.

989
01:22:07,522 --> 01:22:10,355
Now...

990
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:12,450
Japanese women.
What about them?

991
01:22:12,527 --> 01:22:15,018
They must be given the vote.

992
01:22:15,096 --> 01:22:18,224
- The men are not gonna like that.
- Neither did our men at first.

993
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:22,532
<i>General, I'm sorry, but it's too much to expect
a feudal country like Japan...</i>

994
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:25,164
...to swallow a whole new
constitution in one gulp.

995
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:27,333
<i>Their cabinet</i>
<i>will never go for it.</i>

996
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:31,812
The old cabinet wouldn't, but we've
yet to hear from the new prime minister.

997
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:35,407
<i>And may I congratulate you on your
appointment, Mr. Shidehara.</i>

998
01:22:35,483 --> 01:22:37,417
<i>Thank you.</i>

999
01:22:37,485 --> 01:22:39,749
General, I extend to you
my gratitude...

1000
01:22:39,821 --> 01:22:44,349
...for the penicillin your medical
services made available to me.

1001
01:22:44,426 --> 01:22:47,520
It aided me in recovering
from a serious illness.

1002
01:22:47,595 --> 01:22:49,688
Happy to be
of assistance.

1003
01:22:51,566 --> 01:22:53,557
Diseases are conquered,
sir...

1004
01:22:54,536 --> 01:22:58,973
...even very old
epidemic diseases.

1005
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,634
- Yes?
- Sometimes, though...

1006
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:05,168
...the cure is slow
and painful.

1007
01:23:06,247 --> 01:23:08,181
Yes, of course.

1008
01:23:09,551 --> 01:23:12,816
Is there some
particular difficulty?

1009
01:23:19,294 --> 01:23:21,785
General,
our new constitution...

1010
01:23:21,863 --> 01:23:27,301
...must forbid any military
establishment in Japan whatsoever.

1011
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:29,360
There must not
be an army...

1012
01:23:29,437 --> 01:23:32,895
...a navy or an air force.

1013
01:23:32,974 --> 01:23:36,171
We must renounce now
and forever...

1014
01:23:36,244 --> 01:23:40,738
...the use of force as an
instrument of national power.

1015
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:51,754
- Mr. Prime Minister, I can only...
- Please. Hear me out.

1016
01:23:51,826 --> 01:23:53,760
Of course.

1017
01:23:53,828 --> 01:23:56,854
In this way...

1018
01:23:56,931 --> 01:23:59,365
...and only this way...

1019
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:03,393
...can we eliminate forever...

1020
01:24:03,471 --> 01:24:05,837
...the power of
the militarists.

1021
01:24:05,907 --> 01:24:07,966
<i>Only in this way...</i>

1022
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:12,343
<i>...can we reassure the world</i>
<i>that Japan...</i>

1023
01:24:12,414 --> 01:24:17,374
...no longer has warlike design
against any people.

1024
01:24:20,155 --> 01:24:22,623
We are a poor country...

1025
01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:27,218
...with 70 million person
to feed and clothe.

1026
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:30,623
We cannot afford armaments.

1027
01:24:30,698 --> 01:24:35,431
<i>We cannot afford</i>
<i>the trapping of power.</i>

1028
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:40,598
And never, never again
can we suffer...

1029
01:24:40,675 --> 01:24:42,666
...Nagasaki and Hiroshima.

1030
01:24:46,281 --> 01:24:48,442
Let us renounce war, sir.

1031
01:24:49,517 --> 01:24:51,451
Please.

1032
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:56,047
<i>Let us renounce war</i>
<i>in the new constitution...</i>

1033
01:24:56,124 --> 01:24:58,058
...and forever.

1034
01:25:00,428 --> 01:25:02,293
Mr. Shidehara...

1035
01:25:05,033 --> 01:25:09,493
...no man detests war...

1036
01:25:09,571 --> 01:25:11,505
...more than this soldier.

1037
01:25:11,573 --> 01:25:14,872
<i>My abhorrence for it</i>
<i>reached its height...</i>

1038
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:17,810
<i>...with the development</i>
<i>of the atom bomb.</i>

1039
01:25:20,215 --> 01:25:23,309
No man, sir, could be
more moved by your offer...

1040
01:25:24,752 --> 01:25:27,915
...or more determined
to accept it.

1041
01:25:27,989 --> 01:25:30,457
It's damned embarrassing.

1042
01:25:30,525 --> 01:25:33,460
I've been telling Congress for
months we need 400,000 men in Japan.

1043
01:25:33,528 --> 01:25:36,827
MacArthur holds a press conference, says
he can make do with half that number.

1044
01:25:36,898 --> 01:25:38,832
- General, did he clear
this with you?
- No, sir.

1045
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:41,698
- There's been some misunderstanding.
- Not by me there isn't.

1046
01:25:41,769 --> 01:25:45,205
I invited MacArthur to come home. I wanted
to discuss occupation policy with him,

1047
01:25:45,273 --> 01:25:49,334
and I expected him to back up our position
before the congressional committees.

1048
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:51,503
So I held out
the big carrot to him.

1049
01:25:51,579 --> 01:25:54,912
I told him we'd set up a series of welcome-home
demonstrations and a joint session of congress.

1050
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:57,076
You know what he replied?

1051
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:59,746
He said he thought the situation was just too
dangerous there for him to come home right now.

1052
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:03,552
He was just too busy. That's what he said to
the president of the United States, damn it!

1053
01:26:05,693 --> 01:26:08,355
General Derevyanko,
I must say...

1054
01:26:08,429 --> 01:26:11,421
I've missed you.

1055
01:26:11,499 --> 01:26:15,230
Only short visit to Moscow,
a meeting with my superiors,

1056
01:26:15,303 --> 01:26:17,601
a holiday on Caspian Sea
with family.

1057
01:26:17,672 --> 01:26:21,631
Good. I was afraid that
Stalin had you shot.

1058
01:26:21,709 --> 01:26:24,234
No, no.
Why do you say that?

1059
01:26:24,312 --> 01:26:26,678
Would Truman
have you shot?

1060
01:26:26,748 --> 01:26:28,682
Sometimes I wonder.

1061
01:26:31,085 --> 01:26:33,883
General, it's come to my attention
that several hundreds of thousands...

1062
01:26:33,955 --> 01:26:36,116
...of Japanese prisoners
fell into your hands...

1063
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:38,887
...in the closing days
of the war.

1064
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,951
You understand that
the Japanese authorities...

1065
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:46,490
...and my own superiors as well are
pressing me for an accounting.

1066
01:26:46,568 --> 01:26:50,026
Ah, we have some small numbers of
enemy troops in our hands, that is true.

1067
01:26:50,104 --> 01:26:54,370
But I can assure that in
this matter, as you know,

1068
01:26:54,442 --> 01:26:58,037
my government will abide by the
decisions of the Potsdam Conference.

1069
01:26:58,112 --> 01:27:00,842
Yes. When will they
be repatriated?

1070
01:27:00,915 --> 01:27:02,780
Soon.

1071
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:06,047
In that connection,
my government is making plans...

1072
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:09,146
...for the occupation
of Hokkaido Island.

1073
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:13,957
Hokkaido Island is occupied.
It is under my command.

1074
01:27:15,196 --> 01:27:17,756
The Soviet Union
is a coequal ally.

1075
01:27:17,832 --> 01:27:20,096
It is my government's
intention...

1076
01:27:20,168 --> 01:27:22,762
...to occupy Hokkaido
on its own behalf.

1077
01:27:24,839 --> 01:27:29,208
As the supreme commander,
I represent all Allied powers.

1078
01:27:30,878 --> 01:27:34,575
We are fully prepared to commence
our rightful occupation...

1079
01:27:34,649 --> 01:27:37,015
...whether you permit or not.

1080
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:40,179
You see, the terms of
my command are absolute.

1081
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:43,247
This is not Germany.

1082
01:27:43,324 --> 01:27:48,421
I will not countenance separate
spheres of influence or occupation...

1083
01:27:48,496 --> 01:27:51,693
...of the home islands of Japan
as long as I'm in command.

1084
01:27:53,434 --> 01:27:56,426
Well, then, sir,
my government...

1085
01:27:56,504 --> 01:27:58,802
...will insist upon
a new supreme commander.

1086
01:28:00,975 --> 01:28:03,603
If the day comes
when Soviet troops...

1087
01:28:03,678 --> 01:28:08,206
...attempt to land on Japanese soil
without my expressed consent...

1088
01:28:09,717 --> 01:28:13,517
...I will throw the entire Soviet
delegation in Tokyo into jail.

1089
01:28:15,156 --> 01:28:17,181
Including you...

1090
01:28:17,258 --> 01:28:19,192
...General Derevyanko.

1091
01:28:21,829 --> 01:28:23,763
I believe you would.

1092
01:28:23,831 --> 01:28:27,164
And I believe
this is where you get off.

1093
01:28:37,345 --> 01:28:41,782
As the historic
changes continue to transform Japanese life...

1094
01:28:41,849 --> 01:28:44,579
...it was becoming evident this
week that the women of Japan...

1095
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:48,349
...were winning their fight to end
family contract marriages,

1096
01:28:48,423 --> 01:28:51,256
<i>the right to equal</i>
<i>cigarette and sake rations,</i>

1097
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:54,261
<i>and the right to vote.</i>

1098
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:58,288
Dress fashions are not the only
thing that have changed radically.

1099
01:28:58,366 --> 01:29:03,531
In the newly established election,
13 million women went to the polls,

1100
01:29:03,604 --> 01:29:07,040
and in an unprecedented sweep,
elected 38 women lawmakers...

1101
01:29:07,108 --> 01:29:10,373
<i>...to the house</i>
<i>of representatives.</i>

1102
01:29:10,445 --> 01:29:13,209
<i>I regret to say something
terrible has happened.</i>

1103
01:29:13,281 --> 01:29:15,215
A prostitute,
Your Excellency,

1104
01:29:15,283 --> 01:29:18,343
has been elected
to house of representative.

1105
01:29:18,419 --> 01:29:23,379
- Prostitute?
- How many votes did she receive?

1106
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:25,653
256,000.

1107
01:29:29,497 --> 01:29:33,831
She must have
an unusually loyal clientele.

1108
01:29:33,901 --> 01:29:36,927
Now after two and
a half years of painstaking work...

1109
01:29:37,004 --> 01:29:40,303
...the war crimes trial in Tokyo
comes to an end.

1110
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:43,708
<i>As America prepares for another</i>
<i>presidential election year...</i>

1111
01:29:43,778 --> 01:29:45,803
...Japan celebrates 1948...

1112
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:49,646
...with the first anniversary
of its new constitution.

1113
01:29:49,717 --> 01:29:52,311
Mmm... not these.

1114
01:29:54,789 --> 01:29:58,281
I think this one's the best. I
thought you might like that one.

1115
01:30:02,263 --> 01:30:04,288
That's fine.

1116
01:30:04,365 --> 01:30:07,061
Court, what time is it
in Wisconsin?

1117
01:30:07,135 --> 01:30:11,231
- I can never figure out...
- Polls closed an hour ago, and I wish I had been there.

1118
01:30:11,305 --> 01:30:14,866
- I would have had one of these on every lamppost.
- No, you don't, Vic.

1119
01:30:14,942 --> 01:30:18,469
No electioneering within
50 feet of the candidate.

1120
01:30:18,546 --> 01:30:22,277
Why, General, you're not a candidate.
Just another available citizen.

1121
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:24,818
<i>Excuse me, General,</i>
<i>but I'm from Wisconsin,</i>

1122
01:30:24,886 --> 01:30:27,081
and my folks
are voting for you.

1123
01:30:27,155 --> 01:30:31,421
- Matter of fact, I would be, too, only I'm
not old enough.
- <i>Well, thank you, son.</i>

1124
01:30:31,492 --> 01:30:33,426
All the precincts?

1125
01:30:35,963 --> 01:30:38,056
This just came in
on the wire.

1126
01:30:44,806 --> 01:30:46,899
You only won
eight delegates.

1127
01:30:54,282 --> 01:30:57,217
Eight delegates out of 27.

1128
01:30:59,487 --> 01:31:01,580
It's their loss, General.

1129
01:31:01,656 --> 01:31:04,090
<i>You would have made</i>
<i>a great president.</i>

1130
01:31:05,259 --> 01:31:07,693
Well...

1131
01:31:07,762 --> 01:31:10,196
...what's on the calendar
for today?

1132
01:31:10,264 --> 01:31:13,199
<i>Here's to four
more years, Mr. President!</i>

1133
01:31:13,267 --> 01:31:15,201
<i>Hear! Hear!</i>

1134
01:31:15,269 --> 01:31:17,533
<i>Happy days
are here again.</i>

1135
01:31:17,638 --> 01:31:20,937
The skies above
are clear again.

1136
01:31:21,041 --> 01:31:24,442
So let's sing a song
of cheer again.

1137
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:28,480
Happy days
are here again.

1138
01:31:28,548 --> 01:31:31,346
All together
shout it now.

1139
01:31:31,451 --> 01:31:34,784
There's no one
who can doubt it now.

1140
01:31:34,855 --> 01:31:39,952
So let's tell the world
about it now Happy days...

1141
01:31:42,697 --> 01:31:46,724
Roaring their approval
here at the 1949 Tokyo World Series.

1142
01:31:46,801 --> 01:31:49,565
<i>The Giants are</i>
<i>the heavy favorites this year.</i>

1143
01:31:49,637 --> 01:31:54,074
Meanwhile, as the Japanese economy
continued its painful but steady recovery...

1144
01:31:54,141 --> 01:31:58,475
...the mood of the nation began to
reflect the growing cultural change.

1145
01:32:27,508 --> 01:32:31,467
- Yes?
- General, I'm sorry
to disturb you at this late hour.

1146
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:33,741
We have a dispatch
from South Korea.

1147
01:32:33,814 --> 01:32:39,252
The North Koreans have struck in great strength
across the boundary at the 38th parallel.

1148
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:42,084
- In great strength?
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

1149
01:32:44,959 --> 01:32:49,157
<i>Assemble the staff.
I'll be there presently.</i>

1150
01:32:54,535 --> 01:32:56,526
Why, General,
what's happened?

1151
01:33:01,609 --> 01:33:05,545
One last gift
to an old warrior.

1152
01:33:09,850 --> 01:33:13,479
<i>My fellow Americans, tonight
we face a serious situation.</i>

1153
01:33:13,554 --> 01:33:16,318
<i>On the advice of the best</i>
<i>military minds I could muster,</i>

1154
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:20,759
<i>I have decided to commit United States ground forces
to the Korean peninsula.</i>

1155
01:33:21,662 --> 01:33:23,653
We are not at war.

1156
01:33:23,731 --> 01:33:26,495
Acting in concert with
our United Nations allies,

1157
01:33:26,567 --> 01:33:28,797
we are engaged in a police
action to counteract...

1158
01:33:28,869 --> 01:33:31,804
...a bandit raid into South Korea
by North Korean Communists.

1159
01:34:09,076 --> 01:34:11,977
<i>Would you like to use</i>
<i>my binoculars, sir?</i>

1160
01:34:12,046 --> 01:34:13,980
No, thank you.

1161
01:34:14,048 --> 01:34:16,881
I've seen all
I have to see.

1162
01:34:16,951 --> 01:34:20,318
General,
what happens next, sir?

1163
01:34:20,388 --> 01:34:22,481
My father was asked
that same question...

1164
01:34:22,556 --> 01:34:25,582
...when he found himself
surrounded in the Civil War.

1165
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:29,994
He said,"The situation
is simple and apparent.

1166
01:34:30,064 --> 01:34:32,430
The enemy is closing on me
from three sides,

1167
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:35,731
and my plan
is to fight like hell."

1168
01:34:35,803 --> 01:34:39,239
Now with the threat
of annihilation temporarily forestalled,

1169
01:34:39,306 --> 01:34:43,037
MacArthur pays a worried visit
to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek,

1170
01:34:43,110 --> 01:34:47,206
leader of the Nationalist
Chinese on Formosa.

1171
01:34:47,281 --> 01:34:49,943
<i>Son of a bitch, that's a goose step
they're doing.</i>

1172
01:34:50,017 --> 01:34:53,248
Here it is felt the
foundation is being constructed...

1173
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:55,811
...for Sino-American
military cooperation.

1174
01:34:55,890 --> 01:34:59,690
Damn it! Didn't we send MacArthur
to Formosa to do just the opposite?

1175
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:03,856
Call off Chiang and tell him he couldn't send
his troops into mainland China or anywhere?

1176
01:35:03,931 --> 01:35:06,525
We didn't send him over there to
forge his own personal alliances.

1177
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:11,401
Hell, that sounds like we're concluding
some kind of mutual defense treaty.

1178
01:35:11,472 --> 01:35:14,635
Mr. Secretary, I want you to radio
a message to His Majesty MacArthur.

1179
01:35:15,910 --> 01:35:19,107
What's the matter with them
back there?

1180
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:22,115
Have they lost their nerve?
I know all about Chiang.

1181
01:35:22,183 --> 01:35:24,174
If he had two horns
and a tail...

1182
01:35:24,251 --> 01:35:27,880
...we should use him
as long as he's anticommunist.

1183
01:35:27,955 --> 01:35:30,048
We can reform him later.

1184
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:35,185
It's my destiny
to defeat Communism,

1185
01:35:35,262 --> 01:35:39,528
and only God or those Washington
politicians will keep me from doing it.

1186
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:41,761
You didn't
read this one, did you?

1187
01:35:41,836 --> 01:35:44,566
It's a letter to
the Veterans of Foreign Wars.

1188
01:35:44,638 --> 01:35:47,573
"Nothing could be more fallacious
than the threadbare argument...

1189
01:35:47,641 --> 01:35:51,475
...by those who advocate appeasement
and defeatism in the Pacific...

1190
01:35:51,545 --> 01:35:55,538
...that if we defend Formosa,
we alienate continental Asia.

1191
01:35:55,616 --> 01:35:57,743
Signed, Douglas MacArthur."

1192
01:35:57,818 --> 01:35:59,911
You hear that?
Appeasement. Defeatism.

1193
01:35:59,987 --> 01:36:02,512
That's me he's talking about. Alvin,
can you explain why he's done this?

1194
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:05,354
No, Mr. President,
I'm afraid I can't.

1195
01:36:05,426 --> 01:36:09,294
Did any of you know in advance
this letter was gonna be printed?

1196
01:36:09,363 --> 01:36:11,991
I want it withdrawn
right now.

1197
01:36:30,818 --> 01:36:33,787
Good morning, General.
Whitney.

1198
01:36:33,854 --> 01:36:36,345
I haven't seen that pipe
in a long time.

1199
01:36:36,423 --> 01:36:39,881
In looking over your positions
this morning, General Walker,

1200
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:44,795
I saw that plans are afoot to conduct
retrograde movements and abandon the perimeter.

1201
01:36:44,865 --> 01:36:47,993
Effective immediately,
these plans will be scrapped.

1202
01:36:48,068 --> 01:36:50,298
The present line
will be held.

1203
01:36:50,371 --> 01:36:54,137
We don't have any perimeter, General.
Just a few scattered strong points.

1204
01:36:54,208 --> 01:36:56,904
As soon as I put out one fire,
another two get started.

1205
01:36:56,977 --> 01:37:00,777
I know that you're outnumbered in this
thing, but sending you more troops...

1206
01:37:00,848 --> 01:37:03,578
...so you can hang on to
this little corner of Korea...

1207
01:37:03,651 --> 01:37:06,415
...is not good enough.

1208
01:37:06,487 --> 01:37:09,183
Well, I'll settle for
a regimental combat team.

1209
01:37:09,256 --> 01:37:12,623
Can't do it, Walt.
We need every man we've got.

1210
01:37:12,693 --> 01:37:14,627
General Shepherd...

1211
01:37:14,695 --> 01:37:19,098
...is putting together an overwhelming
amphibious assault on Inchon.

1212
01:37:19,166 --> 01:37:23,762
- Inchon?
- In one stroke, it'll cut across the enemy's rear,

1213
01:37:23,838 --> 01:37:27,706
sever his supply lines and isolate
all of his forces south of Seoul.

1214
01:37:27,775 --> 01:37:30,175
Without munitions, supplies,
communications,

1215
01:37:30,244 --> 01:37:32,576
the North Koreans
will be paralyzed.

1216
01:37:32,646 --> 01:37:35,240
- Inchon is the worst...
- <i>Then you can
break out of that corner,</i>

1217
01:37:35,316 --> 01:37:38,114
move north
and overpower them.

1218
01:37:38,185 --> 01:37:42,383
I think that Inchon
will finish the North Koreans.

1219
01:37:44,191 --> 01:37:47,388
- What?
- It'll never be approved.

1220
01:37:47,461 --> 01:37:50,430
<i>Inchon has some of</i>
<i>the highest tides in the world,</i>

1221
01:37:50,497 --> 01:37:53,022
<i>but only once a month</i>
<i>do they reach a height...</i>

1222
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:55,898
<i>...sufficient for our</i>
<i>largest landing craft to go in.</i>

1223
01:37:55,970 --> 01:37:58,336
There are maybe two
three-hour periods...

1224
01:37:58,405 --> 01:38:00,669
...when MacArthur
can put troops ashore.

1225
01:38:00,741 --> 01:38:03,335
Which is not enough time
for a major amphibious landing.

1226
01:38:03,410 --> 01:38:06,402
Exactly. This is little more
than a trench in the mudflats.

1227
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:10,917
If every possible handicap were
listed, Inchon has them all.

1228
01:38:10,985 --> 01:38:15,445
However, gentlemen, MacArthur claims that
these very handicaps are what he's counting on.

1229
01:38:15,522 --> 01:38:18,013
He feels that the enemy
won't believe that anyone...

1230
01:38:18,092 --> 01:38:20,788
would try to surmount
such obstacles.

1231
01:38:20,861 --> 01:38:24,797
The element of surprise
will be his most valuable ally.

1232
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:29,392
What do you think
of His Majesty's plan?

1233
01:38:29,470 --> 01:38:32,598
It's daring, it's brilliant
and it's dangerous.

1234
01:39:00,534 --> 01:39:03,230
Court, you remember
I once said,

1235
01:39:03,304 --> 01:39:08,105
"The bullet has not yet been
cast with my name on it?"

1236
01:39:08,175 --> 01:39:10,109
I certainly do.

1237
01:39:11,345 --> 01:39:14,337
Inchon could be
that bullet.

1238
01:39:16,183 --> 01:39:19,516
There's 70,000 men
out there...

1239
01:39:19,586 --> 01:39:21,520
...waiting to hit Inchon.

1240
01:39:23,624 --> 01:39:28,561
As of this moment, the president has
not personally approved this mission.

1241
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:32,326
The last communication I had
from the Joint Chiefs...

1242
01:39:32,399 --> 01:39:35,596
...said that he'd
been "informed."

1243
01:39:38,238 --> 01:39:40,365
He vacillated, delayed.

1244
01:39:42,409 --> 01:39:46,573
Finally gave
begrudging permission...

1245
01:39:46,647 --> 01:39:48,581
...to proceed here.

1246
01:39:55,089 --> 01:39:57,023
Powerful enemies, Court.

1247
01:39:58,792 --> 01:40:03,058
Who advised Truman that I was insubordinate
when I visited Chiang Kai-shek?

1248
01:40:03,130 --> 01:40:05,462
Who persuaded him
to force me...

1249
01:40:05,532 --> 01:40:09,161
...to withdraw my letters to
the Veterans of Foreign Wars?

1250
01:40:09,236 --> 01:40:13,468
Who are those who seek to humiliate
me and undermine my authority?

1251
01:40:15,376 --> 01:40:19,472
The Communists and their fellow
travelers in the British Foreign Office.

1252
01:40:22,282 --> 01:40:26,912
If Inchon fails,
they will have a jubilee.

1253
01:40:26,987 --> 01:40:31,390
The Joint Chiefs of Staff approved this
invasion because your arguments were valid.

1254
01:40:31,458 --> 01:40:33,551
Yes, they were valid.

1255
01:40:33,627 --> 01:40:36,562
But if the enemy is ready
with a superior force...

1256
01:40:38,465 --> 01:40:40,956
...we will not be able
to disengage...

1257
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:43,196
without suffering
enormous losses.

1258
01:40:48,709 --> 01:40:52,770
We could lose
this entire fleet.

1259
01:40:52,846 --> 01:40:58,751
This date could be marked as one of the
greatest military tragedies in American history.

1260
01:40:58,819 --> 01:41:02,050
- General, I don't think for one...
- Are you surprised, Court?

1261
01:41:03,390 --> 01:41:06,359
I'm sharing my doubts with you
after all these years.

1262
01:41:07,761 --> 01:41:10,924
Did you
think I was invulnerable?

1263
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:17,869
- It just came in. We've
got Wolmi-do Island.
- What?

1264
01:41:17,938 --> 01:41:21,032
- Wolmi-do is ours.
- It took my boys 58 minutes.

1265
01:41:21,108 --> 01:41:24,043
Ho ho! Ha ha!

1266
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:29,811
Good work, General Shepherd.
Good work.

1267
01:41:31,418 --> 01:41:34,114
I'll be the first
to admit it.

1268
01:41:34,188 --> 01:41:37,282
- He did a hell of a job, and
here's to him.
- Hear, hear.

1269
01:41:40,828 --> 01:41:43,626
What's the matter, Alvin? Don't
you like the taste of victory?

1270
01:41:43,697 --> 01:41:45,688
Bourbon's not bad, either.

1271
01:41:45,766 --> 01:41:48,098
- Yes, Inchon is a
masterstroke.
- Damn right it is.

1272
01:41:48,168 --> 01:41:50,261
Now that's what
I call "generaling."

1273
01:41:50,337 --> 01:41:53,465
I've heard that the North Koreans have
turned tail and are running for home.

1274
01:41:53,540 --> 01:41:55,633
It's not the North Koreans
I'm worried about.

1275
01:41:55,709 --> 01:41:57,973
Mr. Panika,
the Indian ambassador to Peking,

1276
01:41:58,045 --> 01:42:00,445
informs us that any American
troops above the 38th parallel...

1277
01:42:00,514 --> 01:42:03,108
...will provoke an intervention
by the Chinese.

1278
01:42:03,183 --> 01:42:07,119
Yesterday we monitored this very
same warning over Radio Peking.

1279
01:42:07,187 --> 01:42:10,816
We've heard that sort of thing
before. How serious are they?

1280
01:42:10,891 --> 01:42:12,825
Frankly, we don't know.

1281
01:42:12,893 --> 01:42:15,191
- What's MacArthur say
about it?
- He's not worried.

1282
01:42:15,262 --> 01:42:17,890
- He's calling it political
blackmail.
- He's probably right.

1283
01:42:17,965 --> 01:42:22,868
Mr. President, let's watch our step. If we
expand the war in Korea to include Red China,

1284
01:42:22,936 --> 01:42:25,803
we're up against the Soviets,
A-bomb and all.

1285
01:42:31,979 --> 01:42:37,611
Alvin. You go on ahead to Wake
Island. Make the usual preparations.

1286
01:42:37,684 --> 01:42:41,176
I think it's time I had a
talk with General MacArthur.

1287
01:42:41,255 --> 01:42:44,247
- I've never met the man.
- Yes, sir.

1288
01:42:50,164 --> 01:42:52,462
Wake Island,
Mr. President.

1289
01:42:52,533 --> 01:42:55,525
<i>By golly, that was quick.</i>

1290
01:42:55,602 --> 01:42:58,196
How about one of you fellas
radio on ahead?

1291
01:42:58,272 --> 01:43:00,832
See if
the big general's there.

1292
01:43:00,908 --> 01:43:04,139
The president should be greeted.
He shouldn't be the greeter.

1293
01:43:11,652 --> 01:43:15,179
I don't see him,
Mr. President.

1294
01:43:15,255 --> 01:43:19,157
They probably had a little trouble
getting him down off his cross.

1295
01:43:50,224 --> 01:43:54,627
- <i>Wait a minute. There he is.
- That son of a bitch isn't
in uniform, he's in costume.</i>

1296
01:43:54,695 --> 01:43:58,358
<i>I don't know why it is an old man like that,
and a five-star general to boot,</i>

1297
01:43:58,432 --> 01:44:02,027
<i>has to run around dressed up like a 19-year-old
second lieutenant.</i>

1298
01:44:02,102 --> 01:44:05,538
I'll tell you one thing,
if he was an officer in my outfit...

1299
01:44:05,606 --> 01:44:08,871
...I'd bust him so fast
he wouldn't know what happened.

1300
01:44:08,942 --> 01:44:10,876
And making me wait.

1301
01:44:10,944 --> 01:44:14,402
He can do that to Harry Truman,
but not to his commander in chief.

1302
01:44:31,098 --> 01:44:33,362
General, I've been
a long time meeting you.

1303
01:44:33,433 --> 01:44:35,901
- I hope it won't be so
long next time.
- So do I.

1304
01:44:35,969 --> 01:44:37,903
- General Bradley.
- MacArthur.

1305
01:44:37,971 --> 01:44:40,531
Bess sent along a plum cake
for the missus.

1306
01:44:40,607 --> 01:44:43,167
How very thoughtful.
Thank you, sir.

1307
01:44:43,243 --> 01:44:45,768
And how are Mrs. Truman
and your daughter?

1308
01:44:45,846 --> 01:44:47,939
They're fine.
Just fine, thank you.

1309
01:44:58,292 --> 01:45:00,988
<i>General,</i>
<i>I've read a little...</i>

1310
01:45:02,896 --> 01:45:06,957
...military history, and it's a pleasure to
congratulate you on your success at Inchon.

1311
01:45:07,034 --> 01:45:09,298
That was the work
of a master strategist.

1312
01:45:09,369 --> 01:45:13,738
Thank you, Mr. President. Coming
from you, that's a real tribute.

1313
01:45:13,807 --> 01:45:18,176
And I'd like to apologize for any
misunderstanding raised by my trip to Formosa.

1314
01:45:18,245 --> 01:45:21,578
Don't think any more about that.
I understand your feelings.

1315
01:45:21,648 --> 01:45:25,379
I was a captain in
Battery D in World War I,

1316
01:45:25,452 --> 01:45:28,387
and that was the center
of the war effort for me.

1317
01:45:28,455 --> 01:45:31,788
Perhaps you should have
stayed in the army.

1318
01:45:31,858 --> 01:45:34,850
Nope, I don't think so.

1319
01:45:34,928 --> 01:45:38,762
I've heard it's a bad idea for
army men to dabble in politics.

1320
01:45:38,832 --> 01:45:43,201
Mr. President, you know that I'm
not involved in politics in any way.

1321
01:45:43,270 --> 01:45:48,105
I did let the politicians make a
chump out of me in the '48 elections.

1322
01:45:48,175 --> 01:45:51,008
If a general is going
to be running against you,

1323
01:45:51,078 --> 01:45:54,241
his name will be Eisenhower,
not MacArthur.

1324
01:45:54,314 --> 01:45:56,248
Eisenhower?

1325
01:45:56,316 --> 01:45:59,808
That man doesn't know as much about
politics as a pig does about Sunday.

1326
01:46:05,726 --> 01:46:08,524
Uh, General...

1327
01:46:08,595 --> 01:46:11,530
...I came over here
to listen to your ideas...

1328
01:46:11,598 --> 01:46:14,624
...on the rehabilitation
of postwar Korea.

1329
01:46:16,670 --> 01:46:18,831
Mind if I smoke,
Mr. President?

1330
01:46:18,905 --> 01:46:23,171
<i>No, I suppose I've had more smoke blown in my face
than any man alive.</i>

1331
01:46:29,049 --> 01:46:32,075
The formal resistance,
I believe...

1332
01:46:34,287 --> 01:46:38,986
...should end in Korea
by Thanksgiving.

1333
01:46:39,059 --> 01:46:42,551
<i>And now that we've authorized military operations
above the parallel,</i>

1334
01:46:42,629 --> 01:46:46,190
- ...do you include North Korea
in that estimate?
- Yes, I do.

1335
01:46:46,266 --> 01:46:50,430
By the time I'm finished, we should
have the entire peninsula under control.

1336
01:46:50,504 --> 01:46:53,166
General, you do understand the
limitations on your directive...

1337
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:55,572
...from the Joint Chiefs
of Staff?

1338
01:46:55,642 --> 01:47:00,102
No military operations beyond
the Chinese and Soviet borders...

1339
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:03,377
...and no American troops
near those borders.

1340
01:47:03,450 --> 01:47:06,544
Yes, I believe I understand
that directive fully...

1341
01:47:06,620 --> 01:47:09,817
...and our boys should be home
by Christmas, Mr. President,

1342
01:47:09,890 --> 01:47:13,883
provided that Red China
stays out of the conflict.

1343
01:47:15,295 --> 01:47:17,354
<i>Well, I'm glad</i>
<i>to hear that, General.</i>

1344
01:47:17,431 --> 01:47:20,298
<i>I've got the whole</i>
<i>United Nations on my back.</i>

1345
01:47:20,367 --> 01:47:22,835
<i>A couple dozen members have got troops under you
in Korea,</i>

1346
01:47:22,903 --> 01:47:27,431
and the bunch of them are scared stiff
that we're pushing them into World War III.

1347
01:47:27,507 --> 01:47:29,998
There's no doubt that Stalin's
pact with Mao Tse-tung...

1348
01:47:30,076 --> 01:47:34,570
...pledges that the Soviet A-bomb backs the
Chinese if we should tangle with them.

1349
01:47:34,648 --> 01:47:37,845
You mentioned Chinese intervention.
Is there any chance of that?

1350
01:47:37,918 --> 01:47:41,081
Mr. President,
you must have...

1351
01:47:41,154 --> 01:47:44,715
...more complete intelligence
on that matter than I have.

1352
01:47:44,791 --> 01:47:48,352
- Anything that I would say would be purely speculative.
- Of course.

1353
01:47:48,428 --> 01:47:50,862
<i>I'm sure that you</i>
<i>also realize that...</i>

1354
01:47:50,931 --> 01:47:52,956
...any question
involving China...

1355
01:47:53,033 --> 01:47:57,060
...requires a political evaluation,
not simply a military one.

1356
01:47:57,137 --> 01:48:00,868
<i>Our intelligence</i>
<i>on the Chinese is limited.</i>

1357
01:48:00,941 --> 01:48:05,776
They're believed to have
about 300,000 men in Manchuria,

1358
01:48:05,846 --> 01:48:09,976
<i>but I doubt they could get more than 50,000 across
the Yalu River.</i>

1359
01:48:10,050 --> 01:48:13,281
<i>They'd be highly vulnerable</i>
<i>to our air attacks.</i>

1360
01:48:13,353 --> 01:48:18,552
So in my opinion, the chances
of Red intervention...

1361
01:48:18,625 --> 01:48:20,559
...are minimal.

1362
01:48:20,627 --> 01:48:23,061
And if they were to try
to get down to the parallel,

1363
01:48:23,129 --> 01:48:25,563
they'd be walking into disaster,
a crushing defeat.

1364
01:48:37,177 --> 01:48:41,546
Well, I've, uh... I've never had
a more satisfactory conference...

1365
01:48:41,615 --> 01:48:43,640
...since I've been president.

1366
01:48:43,717 --> 01:48:46,481
General MacArthur is a member of
the government of the United States,

1367
01:48:46,553 --> 01:48:49,488
and he's loyal to that government
and to the United Nations,

1368
01:48:49,556 --> 01:48:51,751
and he's loyal to the president
and his foreign policy,

1369
01:48:51,825 --> 01:48:54,919
and he's confident that the
fighting in Korea will soon be over.

1370
01:49:03,803 --> 01:49:07,068
<i>Hey! What the hell is this?</i>

1371
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:09,608
Turkey!
Real turkey!

1372
01:49:09,676 --> 01:49:12,304
What'd you expect,
shithead? It's Thanksgiving.

1373
01:49:14,247 --> 01:49:16,715
Best thing about Thanksgiving
is eating white meat!

1374
01:49:19,152 --> 01:49:21,518
I tell you, if I had my
way...

1375
01:49:55,221 --> 01:49:59,385
General Bradley called me at 6:15 this
morning with a message from General MacArthur.

1376
01:50:00,894 --> 01:50:05,194
He says there are 260,000
Chinese out there against him.

1377
01:50:05,265 --> 01:50:08,132
He says he's stymied.

1378
01:50:08,201 --> 01:50:10,396
<i>Says he has to go over</i>
<i>on the defensive.</i>

1379
01:50:10,470 --> 01:50:14,031
It isn't a matter of a few volunteers.
The Chinese have jumped in with both feet.

1380
01:50:15,942 --> 01:50:19,901
Well, what are they saying
about me in Washington?

1381
01:50:19,980 --> 01:50:23,279
Sir, to be candid about it, they
think you walked into a Chinese trap.

1382
01:50:24,517 --> 01:50:26,917
That was a deliberate
misunderstanding.

1383
01:50:26,987 --> 01:50:30,047
The defeat of the North Koreans
was decisive.

1384
01:50:30,123 --> 01:50:33,092
In the face of this victory,
the Chinese Communists...

1385
01:50:33,159 --> 01:50:37,926
...have committed the most offensive act
of international lawlessness in history!

1386
01:50:37,998 --> 01:50:42,059
We are now facing
a new, fresh,

1387
01:50:42,135 --> 01:50:44,433
highly trained army!

1388
01:50:44,504 --> 01:50:50,067
What does Truman mean by
calling this a "police action" ?

1389
01:50:50,143 --> 01:50:54,671
Isn't it a fact that the
casualties are mounting daily?

1390
01:50:54,748 --> 01:50:56,978
This "police action"...

1391
01:50:57,050 --> 01:51:00,611
...has almost destroyed
the Korean nation.

1392
01:51:00,687 --> 01:51:02,552
For what?

1393
01:51:04,624 --> 01:51:07,923
I've seen as much blood and
disaster as any man now living.

1394
01:51:07,994 --> 01:51:10,326
Every time
I come out of here...

1395
01:51:11,398 --> 01:51:15,732
...I could just...
just be sick!

1396
01:51:15,802 --> 01:51:17,997
It curdles my stomach.

1397
01:51:18,071 --> 01:51:21,097
Does he intend
to let this go on?

1398
01:51:21,174 --> 01:51:23,108
By what sophistry
of reason?

1399
01:51:23,176 --> 01:51:25,337
Sir, he has the Russians
to consider...

1400
01:51:25,412 --> 01:51:27,346
...and our allies.

1401
01:51:27,414 --> 01:51:29,712
General Bradley
feels the same way.

1402
01:51:29,783 --> 01:51:32,718
He says that a war with China
would be the wrong war...

1403
01:51:32,786 --> 01:51:37,052
...at the wrong time in the wrong
place and with the wrong enemy.

1404
01:51:37,123 --> 01:51:40,490
The Joint Chiefs of Staff.

1405
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:45,190
I requested permission to bomb
the Chinese airfields in Manchuria.

1406
01:51:45,265 --> 01:51:47,199
The request was denied.

1407
01:51:47,267 --> 01:51:50,668
I requested permission for hot
pursuit of enemy aircraft...

1408
01:51:50,737 --> 01:51:52,967
...into their privileged sanctuary
above the Yalu.

1409
01:51:53,039 --> 01:51:55,030
That request was denied.

1410
01:51:55,108 --> 01:51:59,602
I requested permission to bomb the Yalu
bridges to keep the Chinese out of Korea.

1411
01:51:59,679 --> 01:52:01,544
They said,

1412
01:52:01,614 --> 01:52:03,844
you might bomb...

1413
01:52:03,917 --> 01:52:06,943
...the southern half
of the bridges only.

1414
01:52:07,020 --> 01:52:11,150
<i>In my 50 years</i>
<i>of military service...</i>

1415
01:52:11,224 --> 01:52:15,923
...I have never learned
how to bomb half a bridge!

1416
01:52:19,966 --> 01:52:23,834
It's the most imbecilic order ever
given to a commander in the field.

1417
01:52:28,475 --> 01:52:31,239
This...

1418
01:52:31,311 --> 01:52:33,370
...is appeasement.

1419
01:52:33,446 --> 01:52:36,609
Unless some positive and
immediate action can be taken,

1420
01:52:36,683 --> 01:52:39,743
we should withdraw
our forces to Japan.

1421
01:52:39,819 --> 01:52:42,049
Forgive me, sir,
but...

1422
01:52:42,122 --> 01:52:44,113
...there are some of those
back home who believe...

1423
01:52:44,190 --> 01:52:48,058
...that it's possible to regain
the offensive without...

1424
01:52:48,128 --> 01:52:50,358
...well, without danger
of widening the war.

1425
01:52:50,430 --> 01:52:53,888
Without widening the war?

1426
01:52:57,437 --> 01:53:02,500
Well, the 8th Army is Ridgway's
now. He can do what he likes.

1427
01:53:02,575 --> 01:53:04,736
<i>It won't do any good.</i>

1428
01:53:04,811 --> 01:53:08,611
For the first time
in military history...

1429
01:53:08,681 --> 01:53:13,778
...a commander has been denied
the use of his military power...

1430
01:53:13,853 --> 01:53:18,881
to safeguard the lives of his
soldiers and the safety of his army.

1431
01:53:18,958 --> 01:53:24,760
It leaves me with a sense
of inexpressible... shock.

1432
01:53:28,968 --> 01:53:32,529
Well, hallelujah. Matt Ridgway's
retaken Seoul. What'd I tell you?

1433
01:53:36,042 --> 01:53:38,135
I wish I could celebrate...

1434
01:53:39,946 --> 01:53:42,141
...but the war
hasn't been won.

1435
01:53:42,215 --> 01:53:45,207
The battle lines roll
up and down, up and down.

1436
01:53:46,286 --> 01:53:48,220
Victory nowhere in sight.

1437
01:53:49,789 --> 01:53:52,257
This isn't war.
It's half war.

1438
01:53:53,860 --> 01:53:57,023
It's an immoral compromise
with evil.

1439
01:53:59,399 --> 01:54:02,300
There's more than dust
settling in Korea, Sid.

1440
01:54:03,803 --> 01:54:05,828
It's American blood.

1441
01:54:05,905 --> 01:54:08,533
Yes, sir.

1442
01:54:08,608 --> 01:54:12,840
Oh, the head of the United Kingdom
mission wants an appointment with you, sir.

1443
01:54:12,912 --> 01:54:15,005
What does he want?

1444
01:54:15,081 --> 01:54:18,175
He's worried that we're
getting desperate in Korea,

1445
01:54:18,251 --> 01:54:20,685
and we'll use the bomb. Huh!

1446
01:54:20,753 --> 01:54:24,189
Probably more worried about protecting
British profits in Hong Kong...

1447
01:54:24,257 --> 01:54:28,557
- ...than in saving lives in Korea.
- I'll shift his appointment, sir.

1448
01:54:28,628 --> 01:54:31,461
Excuse me, General. We just got
word that Washington wants you...

1449
01:54:31,531 --> 01:54:33,965
...to stop all offensive
operations immediately.

1450
01:54:37,937 --> 01:54:39,871
What?

1451
01:54:39,939 --> 01:54:44,842
They want to affect a political
rather than a military solution.

1452
01:54:44,911 --> 01:54:48,779
They're planning to draft
a cease-fire proposal.

1453
01:54:48,848 --> 01:54:51,749
They ask for any recommendations
you may have for minor adjustments...

1454
01:54:51,818 --> 01:54:54,685
...along your battle lines to consolidate
your position for adequate defense.

1455
01:54:54,754 --> 01:54:58,190
"Minor adjustments?" What
are they talking about?

1456
01:54:58,258 --> 01:55:01,819
Why should I recommend anything?
This is total capitulation!

1457
01:55:01,895 --> 01:55:05,387
<i>Well, sir, in view of Truman's feeling, you want to
substitute your policy for his.</i>

1458
01:55:05,465 --> 01:55:08,366
<i>I couldn't substitute</i>
<i>my policy for Mr. Truman's,</i>

1459
01:55:08,434 --> 01:55:12,564
because Mr. Truman
doesn't have a policy!

1460
01:55:12,639 --> 01:55:16,769
<i>Fine, sir. Why don't you let me notify them that you're taking
the proposals under study...</i>

1461
01:55:16,843 --> 01:55:20,574
No.
I have a better idea.

1462
01:55:20,647 --> 01:55:23,275
We'll send a message
to the Chinese commander.

1463
01:55:23,349 --> 01:55:26,750
Put it on all the wire services.
I want maximum exposure.

1464
01:55:26,819 --> 01:55:30,186
<i>Sir, you have been specifically prohibited</i>
<i>from issuing any statements.</i>

1465
01:55:30,256 --> 01:55:32,781
<i>Sir, that is a direct order</i>
<i>from the president.</i>

1466
01:55:36,396 --> 01:55:39,661
And that is part
of a dangerous concept...

1467
01:55:39,732 --> 01:55:43,725
...that men of the armed forces
owe their primary allegiance...

1468
01:55:43,803 --> 01:55:47,330
...to these temporary occupants
of the White House,

1469
01:55:47,407 --> 01:55:51,673
instead of to the country and the
Constitution we're sworn to defend!

1470
01:55:54,547 --> 01:55:57,209
I ought to kick his insubordinate
ass right in the Sea of Japan.

1471
01:55:57,283 --> 01:56:01,652
The lousiest trick he's pulled. I travel 14,000
miles to reach an understanding face-to-face,

1472
01:56:01,721 --> 01:56:04,815
- and he still thinks he can do what he damn
well pleases.
- <i>Can you imagine?</i>

1473
01:56:04,891 --> 01:56:09,590
He actually sent a message to the Chinese
threatening to destroy their forces...

1474
01:56:09,662 --> 01:56:12,529
...unless they were to negotiate
a solution with him personally.

1475
01:56:12,598 --> 01:56:15,328
You know,
there's a story...

1476
01:56:15,401 --> 01:56:18,370
...where Abe Lincoln was trying to
mount a horse that was skittish,

1477
01:56:18,438 --> 01:56:21,532
and the horse kicked a
hind hoof into the stirrup.

1478
01:56:21,607 --> 01:56:24,269
So Lincoln says to him, "If you're
gonna get on, I'll get off."

1479
01:56:24,344 --> 01:56:26,312
Well, I'm not
getting off.

1480
01:56:26,379 --> 01:56:29,314
I think Roosevelt should have pulled
Wainwright out of Corregidor...

1481
01:56:29,382 --> 01:56:32,215
...and left that five-star brass hat
MacArthur there to be the martyr.

1482
01:56:32,285 --> 01:56:34,947
What shall I do with
the cease-fire proposal?

1483
01:56:35,021 --> 01:56:38,821
Scrap it. I can't approach the Chinese
on any political basis, not after this.

1484
01:56:38,891 --> 01:56:42,122
That man's trying to start World War
III, and I'm trying to prevent it.

1485
01:56:42,195 --> 01:56:46,222
I'm gonna fire that brass hat prima donna
right now. Who does he think he is? God?

1486
01:56:46,299 --> 01:56:49,291
What do you think Congress would
do if I relieve the big general?

1487
01:56:49,369 --> 01:56:51,462
Congress would
flay you alive.

1488
01:56:51,537 --> 01:56:55,200
Fortunately for me, the Navy
outfielder's throw was also wild,

1489
01:56:55,274 --> 01:56:58,971
over the third baseman's head,
and with those two wild throws,

1490
01:56:59,045 --> 01:57:01,980
I was able to dash around
the bases into home...

1491
01:57:02,048 --> 01:57:04,881
...with what turned out to be
the winning run.

1492
01:57:04,951 --> 01:57:08,978
- Excuse me.
- And... And
the final score was...

1493
01:57:09,055 --> 01:57:12,684
...West Point 4, Annapolis 3.

1494
01:57:12,759 --> 01:57:16,855
I think that the loudest cheers
were led by my mother.

1495
01:57:16,929 --> 01:57:20,729
She was always there.

1496
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:25,100
They used to say about us that we were
the first... the only mother and son...

1497
01:57:25,171 --> 01:57:28,265
...ever to graduate from
West Point on the same day.

1498
01:57:31,644 --> 01:57:36,172
That was in Annapolis
in the spring of...

1499
01:57:48,795 --> 01:57:51,025
Well, Jeannie...

1500
01:57:51,097 --> 01:57:53,930
...we're going home
at last.

1501
01:58:05,311 --> 01:58:08,303
That was the first varsity
baseball game ever played...

1502
01:58:08,381 --> 01:58:10,975
...between West Point
and the Naval Academy.

1503
01:58:14,787 --> 01:58:17,756
Well, so much for
my baseball career...

1504
01:58:18,825 --> 01:58:20,816
...and for happy memories.

1505
01:58:27,834 --> 01:58:31,895
And now will you...
excuse us, please?

1506
01:58:54,093 --> 01:58:56,357
I've never seen
anything like it.

1507
01:58:56,429 --> 01:59:00,422
The entire city's come out to celebrate
the return of America's greatest hero.

1508
01:59:04,070 --> 01:59:07,164
Officials estimate from
seven to ten-million people...

1509
01:59:07,240 --> 01:59:09,504
...are here on hand, and that
surpasses Lindbergh's...

1510
01:59:09,575 --> 01:59:12,169
...and Eisenhower's homecomings
put together.

1511
01:59:12,245 --> 01:59:15,578
Schools are out.
The crowd is excited.

1512
01:59:15,648 --> 01:59:19,084
The office workers are...
just have taken a holiday.

1513
01:59:21,754 --> 01:59:23,779
Meanwhile,
in our nation's capital,

1514
01:59:23,856 --> 01:59:27,019
the statement from the Joint
Chiefs of Staff said in part, quote:

1515
01:59:27,093 --> 01:59:30,062
"It is fundamental
that all military commanders...

1516
01:59:30,129 --> 01:59:33,587
...must be governed by our laws and
the constitutional guarantee...

1517
01:59:33,666 --> 01:59:36,226
...of civilian control
over the military."

1518
01:59:36,302 --> 01:59:38,463
When asked to comment,
President Truman said:

1519
01:59:38,538 --> 01:59:42,474
People who think they're God are bound
to get into trouble sooner or later.

1520
01:59:42,542 --> 01:59:46,410
You have to understand that the people of
this country are men and women of common sense,

1521
01:59:46,479 --> 01:59:51,940
and whenever anybody gets too far out of line,
the people are gonna put him out of business.

1522
01:59:55,354 --> 02:00:00,553
But once war
has been forced upon us...

1523
02:00:00,626 --> 02:00:03,823
...there is no other
alternative...

1524
02:00:03,896 --> 02:00:06,922
...than to apply
every available means...

1525
02:00:06,999 --> 02:00:09,263
...to bring it to a swift end.

1526
02:00:11,337 --> 02:00:15,330
War's very object
is victory,

1527
02:00:15,408 --> 02:00:17,899
not prolonged indecision.

1528
02:00:19,412 --> 02:00:21,403
In war...

1529
02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:26,440
...there can be no substitute
for victory.

1530
02:00:30,356 --> 02:00:34,816
For history teaches us,
with unmistakable emphasis...

1531
02:00:34,894 --> 02:00:40,389
...that appeasement but begets
new and bloodier war.

1532
02:00:40,466 --> 02:00:45,233
Like blackmail,
it lays the basis for new...

1533
02:00:45,304 --> 02:00:47,738
...and increasingly
greater demands...

1534
02:00:47,807 --> 02:00:50,503
...until, as in blackmail...

1535
02:00:50,576 --> 02:00:54,569
...violence becomes
the only alternative.

1536
02:01:01,921 --> 02:01:04,481
"Why..."

1537
02:01:04,557 --> 02:01:09,893
"Why," my soldiers
asked of me,

1538
02:01:09,962 --> 02:01:15,867
"surrender military advantages
to an enemy in the field?"

1539
02:01:19,639 --> 02:01:21,573
I could not answer.

1540
02:01:24,143 --> 02:01:27,476
The magnificence
of the courage...

1541
02:01:27,546 --> 02:01:30,606
...and fortitude
of the Korean people...

1542
02:01:32,618 --> 02:01:34,552
...defies description.

1543
02:01:36,922 --> 02:01:41,120
They have chosen
to risk death...

1544
02:01:41,193 --> 02:01:43,525
...rather than slavery.

1545
02:01:45,798 --> 02:01:48,323
Their last words
to me were...

1546
02:01:50,870 --> 02:01:55,330
..."Don't scuttle
the Pacific."

1547
02:02:06,185 --> 02:02:10,918
I am closing my 52 years
of military service.

1548
02:02:13,926 --> 02:02:17,555
When I joined the army, even
before the turn of the century...

1549
02:02:19,265 --> 02:02:24,328
...it was the fulfillment of all
my boyish hopes and dreams.

1550
02:02:26,439 --> 02:02:28,498
The world
has turned over many times...

1551
02:02:28,574 --> 02:02:32,305
...since I took the oath
on the plain at West Point...

1552
02:02:33,779 --> 02:02:37,681
...and the hopes and dreams
have long since vanished.

1553
02:02:40,453 --> 02:02:42,387
But I still remember
the refrain...

1554
02:02:42,455 --> 02:02:47,358
...of one of the most popular
barrack ballads of that day...

1555
02:02:48,427 --> 02:02:51,487
...which proclaimed
most proudly that...

1556
02:02:52,631 --> 02:02:57,034
..."Old soldiers never die...

1557
02:02:58,738 --> 02:03:02,765
they just... fade away."

1558
02:03:05,678 --> 02:03:08,408
Like the old soldier
of that ballad...

1559
02:03:10,349 --> 02:03:13,147
...I now close
my military career...

1560
02:03:15,521 --> 02:03:19,582
...and just... fade away...

1561
02:03:19,658 --> 02:03:21,785
<i>...an old soldier...</i>

1562
02:03:22,862 --> 02:03:25,797
<i>...who tried to do his duty...</i>

1563
02:03:25,865 --> 02:03:27,799
...as God...

1564
02:03:28,868 --> 02:03:32,736
...gave him the light
to see that duty.

1565
02:03:42,415 --> 02:03:44,349
Good-bye.

1566
02:03:58,931 --> 02:04:02,332
Good-bye, hell. He's running
for president.

1567
02:04:02,401 --> 02:04:05,529
I give you the greatest war hero...

1568
02:04:05,604 --> 02:04:09,665
...America has ever known,
our finest leader of men,

1569
02:04:09,742 --> 02:04:12,176
our most
brilliant strategist,

1570
02:04:12,244 --> 02:04:14,872
a man of inspiration
and a man of action...

1571
02:04:14,947 --> 02:04:19,509
...I give you the next president
of the United States,

1572
02:04:19,585 --> 02:04:22,816
five-star General
of the Army...

1573
02:04:22,888 --> 02:04:26,324
...Dwight David Eisenhower!

1574
02:04:39,772 --> 02:04:42,366
What kind of president
do you think he's gonna make?

1575
02:04:46,946 --> 02:04:50,040
I think he'll make
a fine president.

1576
02:04:50,115 --> 02:04:53,346
He was the best clerk
who ever served under me.

1577
02:05:03,329 --> 02:05:06,025
<i>The shadows
are lengthening for me.</i>

1578
02:05:07,566 --> 02:05:09,500
<i>Twilight is here.</i>

1579
02:05:11,403 --> 02:05:17,103
My days of old have vanished
tone and tint,

1580
02:05:17,176 --> 02:05:21,078
they have gone glimmering through
the dreams of things that were.

1581
02:05:23,382 --> 02:05:26,613
Their memory is one...

1582
02:05:26,685 --> 02:05:29,085
...of wondrous beauty...

1583
02:05:29,154 --> 02:05:32,180
...watered by tears
and coaxed and caressed...

1584
02:05:32,258 --> 02:05:35,318
<i>...by the smiles</i>
<i>of yesterday.</i>

1585
02:05:35,394 --> 02:05:38,659
<i>I listen vainly</i>
<i>but with thirsty ear...</i>

1586
02:05:38,731 --> 02:05:41,131
<i>...for the witching melody...</i>

1587
02:05:41,200 --> 02:05:44,966
<i>...of faint bugles</i>
<i>blowing reveille,</i>

1588
02:05:45,037 --> 02:05:48,234
<i>of far drums</i>
<i>beating the long roll.</i>

1589
02:05:49,475 --> 02:05:52,467
<i>In my dreams,</i>
<i>I hear the crash of guns,</i>

1590
02:05:52,545 --> 02:05:55,673
the rattle of musketry,

1591
02:05:55,748 --> 02:05:59,206
the strange
mournful mutter...

1592
02:05:59,285 --> 02:06:01,310
...of the battlefield.

1593
02:06:05,224 --> 02:06:08,250
But in the evening
of my memory...

1594
02:06:09,328 --> 02:06:11,319
...always I return...

1595
02:06:13,599 --> 02:06:15,590
...to West Point.

1596
02:06:17,202 --> 02:06:20,399
Always there echoes
and re-echoes...

1597
02:06:21,473 --> 02:06:23,873
...duty...

1598
02:06:23,943 --> 02:06:26,605
...honor...

1599
02:06:26,679 --> 02:06:28,613
...country.

1600
02:06:34,053 --> 02:06:36,146
Today...

1601
02:06:36,221 --> 02:06:40,681
marks my final roll call
with you.

1602
02:06:42,861 --> 02:06:46,854
But I want you to know
that when I cross the river...

1603
02:06:46,932 --> 02:06:50,698
...my last
conscious thoughts...

1604
02:06:52,972 --> 02:06:56,874
...will be of the Corps...

1605
02:06:59,411 --> 02:07:01,276
...and the Corps...

1606
02:07:03,382 --> 02:07:05,316
...and the Corps.

1607
02:07:11,857 --> 02:07:13,791
I bid you...

1608
02:07:15,728 --> 02:07:17,662
...farewell.
