1
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,678
If something gets bathed in the moonlight,

2
00:00:29,246 --> 00:00:31,148
it becomes a myth.

3
00:00:32,015 --> 00:00:35,085
That means our story will become a myth.

4
00:00:38,922 --> 00:00:41,591
(The Bride of Habaek)

5
00:00:41,691 --> 00:00:45,362
(Episode 15)

6
00:00:54,204 --> 00:00:56,907
Well, we're being really
romantic right now, you know.

7
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:59,643
But why is it that I keep
thinking about that thing?

8
00:01:01,011 --> 00:01:02,079
About what?

9
00:01:02,412 --> 00:01:04,548
The seafood noodles I
told you about earlier.

10
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,817
I keep ruining the mood
by thinking about how...

11
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:10,620
there were 12 clams in the bowl of noodles.

12
00:01:12,956 --> 00:01:16,693
My mom and dad kept arguing
even at the restaurant.

13
00:01:16,927 --> 00:01:18,661
I was on pins and needles,

14
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,997
so I kept counting the clams
in the bowl of noodles.

15
00:01:21,431 --> 00:01:24,234
There were 12 of them.
"There are so many of them."

16
00:01:25,402 --> 00:01:28,038
"Dad, there are 12 clams in this."

17
00:01:28,538 --> 00:01:30,140
I wanted to say that,

18
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:33,176
but my mom kept throwing
a fit at my dad nonstop.

19
00:01:34,144 --> 00:01:35,979
What was so important?

20
00:01:37,581 --> 00:01:40,150
My dad said nothing and just kept quiet.

21
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:42,485
That got her even more exasperated,

22
00:01:42,486 --> 00:01:44,254
so she said whatever that came to her mind.

23
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:48,658
I kept counting the clams over and over.

24
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,579
No matter how many times I
counted, there were 12 of them.

25
00:01:56,766 --> 00:01:58,535
What do you think...

26
00:02:00,737 --> 00:02:02,672
was so important to my dad?

27
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,977
You said you're a deity.

28
00:02:07,511 --> 00:02:09,312
Then grant me a wish.

29
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,048
Let me meet my dad.

30
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:15,585
I want to ask him why he had to
dump all of these burdens on me...

31
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,686
and if he's been able to sleep at night...

32
00:02:17,687 --> 00:02:19,855
and eat since leaving like that.

33
00:02:19,856 --> 00:02:21,457
I want to tell him to
take them all from me.

34
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,459
He couldn't even save his own daughter.

35
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,329
How is he going to save the world?
If I could ask him that question,

36
00:02:28,198 --> 00:02:29,933
I'd have nothing more to wish for.

37
00:02:30,834 --> 00:02:33,503
- Have you tried to look for him?
- No, I haven't.

38
00:02:34,137 --> 00:02:37,007
What if I do and find him here in Korea?

39
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:42,279
If he never visited us even though
he's been here the whole time...

40
00:02:43,813 --> 00:02:45,282
Then what should I do?

41
00:02:46,016 --> 00:02:47,250
How do you feel now?

42
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,022
Is that really your wish?

43
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:55,692
Meeting your dad and telling him
what you've wanted to say to him.

44
00:03:01,464 --> 00:03:03,033
I think so.

45
00:03:48,712 --> 00:03:49,779
What is it?

46
00:03:50,413 --> 00:03:51,514
Nothing.

47
00:03:59,055 --> 00:04:01,524
This is nice.

48
00:04:01,758 --> 00:04:02,959
What's nice?

49
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:05,895
Do you know why people get married?

50
00:04:06,196 --> 00:04:09,036
It's because they don't want to part
after a whole day of fun together.

51
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,402
But we live together, so we
don't have to part ways.

52
00:04:13,637 --> 00:04:15,238
Living together is a good thing.

53
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,547
Is there a marriage system
in the world of deities?

54
00:04:19,943 --> 00:04:22,779
I can say that there is. But then
again, I can say there isn't.

55
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,581
What does that mean?

56
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,783
You can get married if you want to,

57
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:29,719
but it's neither exclusive, nor
does it have any binding power.

58
00:04:30,654 --> 00:04:32,422
What? Come again? If that's the case,

59
00:04:32,722 --> 00:04:35,091
can both parties cheat on each
other whenever they want to?

60
00:04:35,892 --> 00:04:38,028
It's very freewheeling.

61
00:04:39,396 --> 00:04:41,716
That's why people are not sure
who Lady Yuhwa's mother is.

62
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,434
Who is Lady Yuhwa?

63
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,370
Your daughter.

64
00:04:48,004 --> 00:04:50,372
Ju Mong's mother and King
Yuri's maternal grandmother.

65
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,675
You're King Yuri's maternal
grandfather, so she's your wife.

66
00:04:52,676 --> 00:04:54,244
- I've never been married.
- Whatever.

67
00:04:54,944 --> 00:04:56,513
Don't even try to pretend.

68
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,362
You look like you're sulking.

69
00:05:12,862 --> 00:05:15,398
- What did you just say?
- Give me a glass of water.

70
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:22,138
Well, why do laws and systems exist?

71
00:05:22,305 --> 00:05:25,041
Their power comes from
their legal binding force.

72
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:27,444
What? Freewheeling?

73
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:29,412
Gosh, is it like "Animal Kingdom" or what?

74
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,648
Is it because they're all Mr.
And Ms. Nature?

75
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,432
By any chance,

76
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:53,136
is polygamy practiced in
the world of deities?

77
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,771
How did you know?

78
00:05:55,004 --> 00:05:57,640
Even some deities have many husbands.

79
00:05:57,741 --> 00:06:00,477
- Are you serious?
- Isn't it obvious?

80
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,277
We neither grow old nor die.

81
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:05,682
How can we be expected to be
faithful to only one person?

82
00:06:06,383 --> 00:06:07,450
What's the matter?

83
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:10,120
Then in your case...

84
00:06:10,854 --> 00:06:12,489
How many times have you been married?

85
00:06:13,757 --> 00:06:16,525
- I've never been married.
- Then what about Lady Yuhwa...

86
00:06:16,526 --> 00:06:18,661
Come to your senses, woman.

87
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:21,297
Get me another glass of water.

88
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:34,177
One more glass.

89
00:07:29,732 --> 00:07:33,102
Hey, what are you doing now?

90
00:07:34,103 --> 00:07:35,405
Can't you see?

91
00:07:35,572 --> 00:07:37,439
I don't want to go to bed.

92
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,541
What?

93
00:07:40,477 --> 00:07:42,745
If you don't want to go to bed,

94
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,315
what do you want to do?

95
00:07:45,682 --> 00:07:49,452
Soo Ri is working all night tonight.

96
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,021
Just tonight.

97
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:56,392
- So?
- So...

98
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:01,698
I'd like to...

99
00:08:10,273 --> 00:08:11,674
I'd like to watch some TV with you.

100
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,977
- TV?
- Sit down.

101
00:08:15,645 --> 00:08:16,945
He looks unfamiliar.

102
00:08:16,946 --> 00:08:18,547
He's new.

103
00:08:18,548 --> 00:08:21,850
Introduce him to me. Who is he?

104
00:08:21,851 --> 00:08:23,353
Come here.

105
00:08:23,887 --> 00:08:25,421
- Have we met?
- No.

106
00:08:27,957 --> 00:08:29,459
- So Ah.
- Yes?

107
00:08:46,376 --> 00:08:48,410
What makes you do this?

108
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:50,113
- I read your diary.
- What?

109
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:51,748
What did you say?

110
00:08:52,849 --> 00:08:54,517
Not everyone gets to lie on my lap.

111
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,585
Why would you read someone else's diary?

112
00:08:56,586 --> 00:08:58,220
I thought it was written for me...

113
00:08:58,221 --> 00:08:59,956
20 years ago.

114
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,323
What?

115
00:09:01,324 --> 00:09:04,326
I read a poem you wrote
when you were little.

116
00:09:04,327 --> 00:09:06,329
It's titled, "Daddy's Lap".

117
00:09:06,763 --> 00:09:08,497
"Daddy's lap is mine."

118
00:09:08,498 --> 00:09:09,898
"Go away, Sang Yu."

119
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:11,366
"Daddy's lap is mine."

120
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:13,336
"Curse you, Sang Yu." Do
you call that a poem?

121
00:09:14,103 --> 00:09:16,439
You said you were an amazing
poet when you were little.

122
00:09:25,515 --> 00:09:27,749
Isn't there a rerun of "The Divine Dinner"?

123
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,552
Hey, I know what you're thinking.

124
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,958
If I had your ability,

125
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,227
I'd take charge of cooking
until the day I leave.

126
00:09:48,938 --> 00:09:50,039
When are you leaving?

127
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,208
A message will come.

128
00:09:53,476 --> 00:09:55,712
It could come even tomorrow, right?

129
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,219
Our relationship is time-limited.

130
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:07,457
When I was an intern,

131
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:12,996
I'd meet patients with a terminal
disease and their families.

132
00:10:14,731 --> 00:10:17,200
And I'd feel guilty for some reason.

133
00:10:18,768 --> 00:10:22,105
How would I actually know
how they were feeling?

134
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:25,207
I just tried to comfort them...

135
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,110
the way I was taught to.

136
00:10:27,443 --> 00:10:31,981
In fact, I had no idea what was
going through their minds.

137
00:10:33,016 --> 00:10:35,752
It might have been a better
idea to just cry with them.

138
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:38,588
I'd pour out irresponsible words instead.

139
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,592
Still, I learned something.

140
00:10:44,661 --> 00:10:46,829
I got to see people
preparing for goodbyes...

141
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:50,967
and what gets left after those goodbyes.

142
00:10:53,436 --> 00:10:56,806
For the rest of the
family or for themselves,

143
00:10:57,974 --> 00:11:01,611
they would find a reason why
they should not wither away.

144
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:04,981
Their wandering minds...

145
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:10,420
would find a place to stay in the end.

146
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:20,063
Can I ask you something?

147
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:24,834
What about you?

148
00:11:28,504 --> 00:11:30,239
How do you cope?

149
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:34,844
I have at most 40 to 50 years left.

150
00:11:36,312 --> 00:11:38,514
But your life never ends.

151
00:11:43,352 --> 00:11:44,554
Can I...

152
00:11:46,155 --> 00:11:47,824
be greedy?

153
00:11:50,827 --> 00:11:54,564
Can I ask you to remember me...

154
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:59,202
as long as you can?

155
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,645
What are you doing?

156
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:17,847
You're up.

157
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,649
I woke up early, and I
had nothing else to do.

158
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,785
There was a rerun of "The Divine Dinner".

159
00:13:25,288 --> 00:13:26,422
And?

160
00:13:29,926 --> 00:13:31,327
And what?

161
00:13:31,594 --> 00:13:32,728
Come on.

162
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,533
Are you making breakfast for me?

163
00:13:38,601 --> 00:13:41,570
I found a guy who makes breakfast for me.

164
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:42,839
It's just that I'm hungry.

165
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,473
I see.

166
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:49,111
Then I'll go back to sleep.

167
00:13:51,013 --> 00:13:52,748
I don't usually eat breakfast.

168
00:13:53,616 --> 00:13:54,784
Sit down.

169
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:58,087
My stomach feels heavy if I have breakfast.

170
00:14:00,022 --> 00:14:01,657
Sit down.

171
00:14:03,793 --> 00:14:05,293
I'll wash myself first...

172
00:14:05,294 --> 00:14:07,830
to pay my respect to the meal.

173
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,510
He's so cute, but I can't tell him.

174
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:23,613
He'd get furious.

175
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:27,083
Should I just try?

176
00:14:27,683 --> 00:14:29,418
What if he transforms or something?

177
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,445
This is too much for breakfast.

178
00:14:57,513 --> 00:14:58,948
Who would eat all this?

179
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:04,353
- Do you know what garbage...
- Just say you're happy.

180
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:05,821
That'd be simpler.

181
00:15:09,191 --> 00:15:10,326
Have a seat.

182
00:15:18,234 --> 00:15:19,368
Let's eat.

183
00:15:23,205 --> 00:15:24,340
You can start.

184
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:26,976
So this is how it feels...

185
00:15:29,712 --> 00:15:31,047
when someone cooks for you.

186
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:43,793
Eat.

187
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,431
Let's eat.

188
00:15:54,003 --> 00:15:57,006
I locked the door, but I
couldn't find any pot.

189
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,891
He came to give me the keys.
He couldn't find any pot.

190
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,260
I had to think a lot.

191
00:16:18,594 --> 00:16:20,629
You'd be away from your clinic for a while.

192
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,908
I couldn't decide whether I should
have them delivered to you...

193
00:16:22,932 --> 00:16:24,599
or ask you to meet me.

194
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,602
- You can't do that.
- I know.

195
00:16:27,103 --> 00:16:28,804
That's why I came here.

196
00:16:29,872 --> 00:16:32,807
- Would you like some tea?
- It's too early for tea.

197
00:16:32,808 --> 00:16:34,776
There is no such rule.

198
00:16:34,777 --> 00:16:37,013
In my house, there is.

199
00:16:38,114 --> 00:16:40,049
We don't drink tea in the morning here.

200
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:43,085
We have breakfast instead.

201
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,287
If you haven't eaten, have some breakfast.

202
00:16:46,188 --> 00:16:50,793
- Mr. Shin is very busy...
- I wouldn't mind.

203
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:53,062
Gosh.

204
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:00,735
Ms. Yoon, you're a good cook.

205
00:17:00,736 --> 00:17:01,837
I made it.

206
00:17:02,338 --> 00:17:04,273
She didn't do anything.

207
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:07,243
I made everything.

208
00:17:08,577 --> 00:17:10,379
- I see.
- You probably don't know.

209
00:17:10,813 --> 00:17:13,349
She's a terrible cook.

210
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,161
She can sleep anywhere too.

211
00:17:16,185 --> 00:17:17,853
She falls asleep right away.

212
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:22,291
That's why I always have to...

213
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:25,528
carry her to her bed.

214
00:17:26,862 --> 00:17:28,030
She's such a handful.

215
00:17:28,931 --> 00:17:32,300
There's more. She can't even
turn on the light at the door.

216
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,502
That's why I always turn it on for her.

217
00:17:34,503 --> 00:17:35,970
Also, she rarely cleans.

218
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,540
That's why I clean her place for her.

219
00:17:39,442 --> 00:17:41,744
I take a warm bath every morning.

220
00:17:42,378 --> 00:17:43,945
It doesn't suit her,

221
00:17:43,946 --> 00:17:45,547
but she gets so shy...

222
00:17:45,548 --> 00:17:48,084
whenever she sees me naked.

223
00:17:48,684 --> 00:17:49,852
Hey, look.

224
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,621
Am I wrong?

225
00:17:53,522 --> 00:17:55,857
You said you just can't get used to it.

226
00:17:55,858 --> 00:17:58,494
- Hey, please.
- Am I wrong?

227
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,432
Did you say you just never get sick of it?

228
00:18:06,869 --> 00:18:08,003
Let's eat.

229
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:10,606
Since you two live together,

230
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,209
you know a lot about each other.

231
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,680
Oh, right. Ms. Yoon.

232
00:18:18,447 --> 00:18:20,325
The new owner of the
building your clinic is in.

233
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,617
It's me.

234
00:18:22,451 --> 00:18:23,886
Are you serious?

235
00:18:24,954 --> 00:18:26,755
Is it... Is it really true?

236
00:18:27,123 --> 00:18:30,359
Is that why we got our
rent and deposit lowered?

237
00:18:30,826 --> 00:18:32,128
I told you...

238
00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:34,763
that I'd just buy the building itself.

239
00:18:35,131 --> 00:18:37,867
I told you that I have a lot of money.

240
00:18:38,334 --> 00:18:39,935
A building owner...

241
00:18:40,803 --> 00:18:42,137
Thank you so much.

242
00:18:42,138 --> 00:18:44,807
I'm hugely indebted you.

243
00:18:45,274 --> 00:18:46,542
Not at all.

244
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:51,413
I did it for all tenants of my building.

245
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,450
It seems that Chairman
Shin has been too greedy,

246
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,351
and they've suffered a lot because of it.

247
00:18:56,352 --> 00:18:57,653
Thank you very much.

248
00:18:58,154 --> 00:19:00,956
- I'm so relieved now.
- Please don't mention it.

249
00:19:01,323 --> 00:19:05,928
I should be a good landlord.

250
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,129
You're already such a wonderful landlord...

251
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,698
I'm a king!

252
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,503
I am...

253
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,174
a king.

254
00:19:26,849 --> 00:19:29,094
I like how the house shows traces of time.

255
00:19:29,118 --> 00:19:31,020
I was born in this house.

256
00:19:31,153 --> 00:19:33,055
Half of it is owned by the bank now though.

257
00:19:41,697 --> 00:19:43,032
It's all right.

258
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:45,134
It's okay.

259
00:19:46,402 --> 00:19:47,636
Please stay still.

260
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,540
- Ms. Yoon.
- Yes?

261
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,442
Are you sure we never met in the past?

262
00:19:54,843 --> 00:19:56,879
Yes, as far as I remember.

263
00:19:57,213 --> 00:19:59,047
Then why do I keep...

264
00:19:59,048 --> 00:20:00,849
How dare you try to pull a trick?

265
00:20:10,726 --> 00:20:11,860
Have a seat.

266
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,695
In my house, we drink tea after each meal.

267
00:20:13,696 --> 00:20:15,197
That's the rule here.

268
00:20:19,034 --> 00:20:20,402
Make some tea for us.

269
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,340
What is this?

270
00:20:24,707 --> 00:20:27,109
He's trying hard to look
patriarchal, but it's so awkward.

271
00:20:33,616 --> 00:20:36,151
What an astral sight.

272
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,520
A water deity who's the
king of all deities...

273
00:20:38,687 --> 00:20:40,389
and a half-human-half-deity.

274
00:20:54,803 --> 00:20:56,872
Why did he get changed?

275
00:20:58,073 --> 00:20:59,475
I want it in my mug.

276
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,846
I have my own mug. I call it Yong Yong.

277
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,780
A master and his servant
are both drawn on it.

278
00:21:05,781 --> 00:21:07,516
The design is very artistic.

279
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,451
I worked a part-time gig...

280
00:21:09,618 --> 00:21:11,153
and bought it for her.

281
00:21:12,321 --> 00:21:13,656
I want this in my mug.

282
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:18,594
Well, you should just
drink it in this today.

283
00:21:20,763 --> 00:21:22,665
I'll do that if that's what you want.

284
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:28,604
I should go wash the dishes.

285
00:21:32,074 --> 00:21:33,409
You two look lovely together.

286
00:21:34,643 --> 00:21:35,944
Then why are you here?

287
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,680
The key?

288
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,882
That childish trick of yours
won't even make me blink.

289
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,427
Even if you can't outdo your contender,

290
00:21:42,451 --> 00:21:45,130
he may reveal his shortcomings
if you keep jabbing him.

291
00:21:45,154 --> 00:21:46,622
Like I've told you,

292
00:21:46,855 --> 00:21:48,856
waiting is what I'm best at.

293
00:21:48,857 --> 00:21:52,093
You'll spend the rest of your
life realizing how futile...

294
00:21:52,094 --> 00:21:53,796
that waiting is.

295
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:57,299
And you'll think that this
lifetime of yours is an epic fail.

296
00:21:58,967 --> 00:22:01,070
I envy that confidence of yours.

297
00:22:02,304 --> 00:22:03,539
I'm a king.

298
00:22:05,307 --> 00:22:07,008
Ms. Yoon told me that I shouldn't be...

299
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:08,676
intimidated by others' backgrounds.

300
00:22:08,677 --> 00:22:10,121
That's pointless.

301
00:22:10,145 --> 00:22:13,082
Anyhow, time is on my side.

302
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,218
And come to think of it,
money is on my side too.

303
00:22:17,353 --> 00:22:19,321
- I'm a king.
- I'm a building owner.

304
00:22:20,389 --> 00:22:22,857
What would be more powerful
between money and a king here?

305
00:22:22,858 --> 00:22:24,860
- Shall we see?
- What?

306
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,933
- Ms. Yoon.
- Yes?

307
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,870
You've forgotten about the shift
at the farm in two days, right?

308
00:22:37,806 --> 00:22:38,941
I'm sorry.

309
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,477
This isn't good.

310
00:22:41,577 --> 00:22:44,313
We are friends, but we
also have a contract.

311
00:22:44,546 --> 00:22:47,015
I'm really sorry. I've
been all over the place.

312
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,250
Well... You'll leave in
the afternoon, right?

313
00:22:49,251 --> 00:22:51,411
- Then I'll also...
- Where do you think you're going?

314
00:22:52,888 --> 00:22:54,655
I don't know what this is about,

315
00:22:54,656 --> 00:22:56,176
but you can't take her no matter what.

316
00:22:57,259 --> 00:22:58,894
She's indebted to me.

317
00:22:59,161 --> 00:23:00,495
When she broke the contract for the land,

318
00:23:00,496 --> 00:23:01,763
she agreed to pay the penalty.

319
00:23:01,764 --> 00:23:03,732
She must earn money and pay me back...

320
00:23:03,866 --> 00:23:06,147
in order to fulfill her
obligations and end the contract.

321
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,571
I'll see you that day.

322
00:23:19,748 --> 00:23:22,584
It's because you didn't
allow me to sell the land.

323
00:23:28,023 --> 00:23:29,190
Give me some money.

324
00:23:29,191 --> 00:23:31,492
My servant didn't sell her
land to the halfie...

325
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,262
and have to pay him a penalty.

326
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,364
She owes him money because of us, so...

327
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,035
What a joke.

328
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:46,050
It looks like that was
Ha Baek on the phone.

329
00:23:46,074 --> 00:23:48,042
It looks like Mr. Shin is doing a good job.

330
00:23:48,043 --> 00:23:49,477
He's doing what the coach told him to do.

331
00:23:49,478 --> 00:23:51,580
I don't want to hear that name yet.

332
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:53,514
Try not to bring him up.

333
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:56,518
No, I'll keep talking about
him until you get sick of it.

334
00:23:59,822 --> 00:24:01,390
What is this about?

335
00:24:02,825 --> 00:24:05,127
I heard that women dream
of having breakfast...

336
00:24:05,494 --> 00:24:06,994
made by men they love.

337
00:24:06,995 --> 00:24:09,263
Only foolish human women
would dream of such a thing.

338
00:24:09,264 --> 00:24:11,264
Try to think like a human
for a few minutes, then.

339
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,268
Shouldn't it be with the man I love though?

340
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:17,005
How many more steps do I have to take?
50 or 100?

341
00:24:20,008 --> 00:24:21,777
Will I be able to get there?

342
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:23,645
Get out. I'm going to take a shower.

343
00:24:23,979 --> 00:24:25,247
All right, then.

344
00:24:35,357 --> 00:24:37,326
She's the most difficult
woman to deal with.

345
00:24:38,794 --> 00:24:40,395
I know that, of course.

346
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,172
Ha Baek.

347
00:24:51,874 --> 00:24:53,208
Not today.

348
00:24:53,442 --> 00:24:55,310
My schedule is fully packed.

349
00:24:56,945 --> 00:24:58,180
I'll call you.

350
00:25:02,451 --> 00:25:04,686
When I return to the world of deities,

351
00:25:05,153 --> 00:25:07,033
I'll be sure to turn one
of you into a saury...

352
00:25:07,155 --> 00:25:09,291
and the other one into a sparrow.

353
00:25:20,502 --> 00:25:21,703
Yes, My Lord.

354
00:25:22,538 --> 00:25:25,273
Money. Are you earning a lot of it?

355
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:27,042
Pardon me? Yes.

356
00:25:27,643 --> 00:25:29,343
My duck boat is swamped with customers now.

357
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,547
Oh, right. Lord Joo Dong called.

358
00:25:31,747 --> 00:25:33,781
What? Where is he?

359
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,383
- Why isn't he coming back?
- He'd be back soon.

360
00:25:35,384 --> 00:25:37,424
He said you shouldn't go
anywhere and wait for him.

361
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,489
But why did he call you?

362
00:25:40,689 --> 00:25:41,822
He could've called me.

363
00:25:41,823 --> 00:25:44,058
He said Lord Moo Ra told
him not to call you...

364
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:45,794
because you keep asking for money.

365
00:25:46,395 --> 00:25:47,629
How dare she.

366
00:25:58,106 --> 00:25:59,708
He is...

367
00:26:00,442 --> 00:26:02,377
the one who saved me.

368
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:06,148
He saved me. But...

369
00:26:08,917 --> 00:26:10,018
What?

370
00:26:10,452 --> 00:26:12,120
What are you talking about now?

371
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,631
What was that about?

372
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:26,268
"He saved me." That was all good.

373
00:26:26,768 --> 00:26:30,172
But she said, "But".

374
00:26:30,906 --> 00:26:33,008
That's what keeps bothering me.

375
00:26:36,411 --> 00:26:37,679
I'm sorry I'm a bit late.

376
00:26:37,879 --> 00:26:40,291
My co-worker who has the shift
after mine was late for work.

377
00:26:40,315 --> 00:26:42,283
- Mr. Nam.
- Yes?

378
00:26:42,284 --> 00:26:44,285
I keep having the same dream,

379
00:26:44,286 --> 00:26:45,753
and I can't ignore it.

380
00:26:45,754 --> 00:26:48,123
I never hear the most important part.

381
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:52,527
Is there anything I can do?

382
00:27:01,637 --> 00:27:03,438
I... I don't know.

383
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,609
Why? Gosh!

384
00:27:17,619 --> 00:27:18,687
Hey, what's up?

385
00:27:19,154 --> 00:27:20,421
Is everything all right with you?

386
00:27:20,422 --> 00:27:21,690
What's this about?

387
00:27:22,024 --> 00:27:24,525
It sounds like you want something to be up.

388
00:27:24,526 --> 00:27:27,496
My friend, you've become bitter
after a bad relationship.

389
00:27:27,796 --> 00:27:29,830
My relationship wasn't bad.

390
00:27:29,831 --> 00:27:32,334
Then there must be something
wrong with your dating style.

391
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,803
You love in order to say goodbye?

392
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,071
Some people say they break up
even though they love each other.

393
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,641
But no one loves in order to break up.

394
00:27:40,042 --> 00:27:41,943
You left out "properly".

395
00:27:42,344 --> 00:27:44,046
It's to break up properly.

396
00:27:46,715 --> 00:27:48,483
- Hang up.
- Hold on.

397
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:50,552
How is he doing, your
boyfriend who saved you?

398
00:27:55,223 --> 00:27:57,893
Who is in such a ridiculous relationship?

399
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:21,583
You know it won't work. Why
are you trying so hard?

400
00:28:22,384 --> 00:28:25,487
So when you borrow money, you pay interest?

401
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:30,992
I'll pay you a lot of interest
when I'm back in Land of Water.

402
00:28:32,394 --> 00:28:34,662
No one needs money in the world of deities.

403
00:28:34,663 --> 00:28:36,865
I'm not talking about money.

404
00:28:37,265 --> 00:28:39,100
Tell me if you need anything.

405
00:28:39,101 --> 00:28:40,702
Can you even give up the throne for me?

406
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,607
It's not like I want that.

407
00:28:45,841 --> 00:28:49,945
I might not like you, but I don't
want that kind of tragedy.

408
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:52,947
I'd like you to be around for a long time.

409
00:28:52,948 --> 00:28:54,282
Is that a no?

410
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:58,520
I could give you anything,
be it money or diamonds.

411
00:28:58,687 --> 00:29:00,188
But Moo Ra doesn't like that.

412
00:29:00,889 --> 00:29:02,924
I listen to my girl.

413
00:29:05,026 --> 00:29:06,795
On the internet,

414
00:29:07,095 --> 00:29:10,297
people call someone like you a pushover.

415
00:29:10,298 --> 00:29:13,468
I don't have a problem with that.

416
00:29:16,905 --> 00:29:18,006
I'm leaving.

417
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,775
Hold on.

418
00:29:21,543 --> 00:29:23,503
- I have something to tell you too.
- What is it?

419
00:29:29,217 --> 00:29:30,318
What is it?

420
00:29:33,955 --> 00:29:37,225
What is Moo Ra like?

421
00:29:37,893 --> 00:29:40,695
Did you meet Ha Baek?

422
00:29:41,596 --> 00:29:43,632
Did you attack his weakest part?

423
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,034
It's not like that.

424
00:29:46,234 --> 00:29:49,436
Good. Show him how superior you are...

425
00:29:49,437 --> 00:29:51,573
and how weak he is.

426
00:29:51,973 --> 00:29:53,040
Do you mean that?

427
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,576
I can't send him like this.

428
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,978
He has to become a wreck.

429
00:29:57,245 --> 00:29:59,281
By the time he leaves,

430
00:29:59,514 --> 00:30:01,316
he has to become a total wreck.

431
00:30:03,118 --> 00:30:06,822
You guys are so extreme.

432
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,558
Moo Ra is the most loyal one among us...

433
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,793
as you may already know.

434
00:30:12,327 --> 00:30:15,129
But once she turns her back
on someone, it's the end.

435
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,463
Then why did you do that?

436
00:30:16,464 --> 00:30:17,832
I'm an exception.

437
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:20,535
Moo Ra and I are beyond that.

438
00:30:21,636 --> 00:30:23,038
I came to the wrong person.

439
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:25,740
You don't know Moo Ra well.

440
00:30:26,474 --> 00:30:28,443
You want to know what she
really thinks, right?

441
00:30:34,049 --> 00:30:35,916
You're amazing.

442
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,186
You don't know anything,
yet you know everything.

443
00:30:38,353 --> 00:30:40,387
You know everything, yet
you don't know anything.

444
00:30:40,388 --> 00:30:43,724
That's how I'm different from you guys.

445
00:30:43,725 --> 00:30:45,627
Fine, you're right.

446
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,563
You're so elusive.

447
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:52,766
No one can ever know how far you can go.

448
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,102
If you pay me,

449
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,605
I'll give you advice.

450
00:31:01,743 --> 00:31:04,779
Heartless punks. Are they serious?

451
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,787
Where are you going?

452
00:31:14,756 --> 00:31:16,524
I'm going to pay the cancellation fee.

453
00:31:16,925 --> 00:31:18,526
I told you not to.

454
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,931
I'm sorry.

455
00:31:23,698 --> 00:31:25,367
He insisted on tagging along.

456
00:31:27,736 --> 00:31:29,170
He's a good worker.

457
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,476
I don't know everything
about the world of deities,

458
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:36,878
but considering what I've
heard about Ha Baek,

459
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,281
this is unbelievable.

460
00:31:42,851 --> 00:31:45,086
I can see why Hye Ra is so bothered.

461
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,522
He wants to pay the
cancellation fee that way.

462
00:31:47,923 --> 00:31:51,859
I've told him I get paid for my
daily work, but he doesn't care.

463
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,804
Maybe he doesn't understand
the concept of daily pay.

464
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:56,765
If he doesn't, I could explain to him.

465
00:31:57,565 --> 00:31:58,967
But he does.

466
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,070
Apparently, he read about a case
of a chairman on the internet.

467
00:32:03,071 --> 00:32:04,438
A human chairman got paid
500,000 dollars a day.

468
00:32:04,439 --> 00:32:07,409
As the emperor of deities, my
worth would be immeasurable.

469
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:10,879
But I'll give him the
honor of measuring it.

470
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:12,414
Let's go.

471
00:32:14,416 --> 00:32:17,852
So how much does the king
think his work is worth?

472
00:32:20,755 --> 00:32:22,057
50 million dollars.

473
00:32:23,258 --> 00:32:24,459
50 million dollars?

474
00:32:25,827 --> 00:32:29,064
He wants you to pay him the amount
minus the cancellation fee.

475
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,072
50 million dollars?

476
00:32:37,973 --> 00:32:39,813
You seem to now understand
the power of money.

477
00:32:40,008 --> 00:32:41,576
Your strategy was clumsy though.

478
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,615
Do you think if So Ah had enough money,

479
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,050
I wouldn't have a chance?

480
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:53,722
Regardless of money, you'll never
have a place in her heart.

481
00:32:54,689 --> 00:32:56,658
You know too little about her.

482
00:32:57,125 --> 00:32:58,226
You think so?

483
00:32:59,327 --> 00:33:03,565
Let me tell you what you don't know.

484
00:33:04,265 --> 00:33:05,599
I doubt there is anything.

485
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,701
There is.

486
00:33:06,835 --> 00:33:09,037
It's something you don't
know because you're a deity.

487
00:33:10,038 --> 00:33:11,973
I know it because I'm a human.

488
00:33:14,542 --> 00:33:15,677
What?

489
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,279
Humans...

490
00:33:19,848 --> 00:33:23,385
are lonely from the moment they're born.

491
00:33:40,402 --> 00:33:41,669
Jin Geon. What is it?

492
00:33:47,409 --> 00:33:48,776
Someone came by.

493
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:51,212
- Who?
- He left something for you.

494
00:33:51,312 --> 00:33:53,048
- What is it?
- Give me your hand.

495
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,492
All right. Thank you.

496
00:34:56,878 --> 00:34:59,447
This will be planted somewhere else.

497
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,517
- Let me help you.
- It's okay.

498
00:35:06,221 --> 00:35:07,322
Go to him.

499
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:10,024
It's okay. He's not a kid.

500
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:13,361
Deities in Land of Water would
be shocked to hear that.

501
00:35:13,761 --> 00:35:14,863
A kid?

502
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:18,066
I'm really curious.

503
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,568
Is he such a big deal?

504
00:35:21,936 --> 00:35:23,204
I don't know.

505
00:35:24,139 --> 00:35:26,007
The cave was my whole world.

506
00:35:27,609 --> 00:35:30,444
But when Joo Geol Lin told me
about the world of deities,

507
00:35:30,445 --> 00:35:33,181
half of it was about Ha Baek.

508
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:37,485
Locked up in the cave, I thought of
Ha Baek as the deity of deities.

509
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,220
The deity of deities?

510
00:35:39,521 --> 00:35:42,423
Not all deities have the same powers.

511
00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:46,928
Some powers are allowed
to only certain deities.

512
00:35:47,762 --> 00:35:50,899
Ha Baek could do everything.

513
00:35:51,699 --> 00:35:53,201
He was born to be king.

514
00:35:53,701 --> 00:35:56,871
But there are two things
even Ha Baek can't do.

515
00:35:57,772 --> 00:35:59,607
He can't revive the dead.

516
00:35:59,841 --> 00:36:00,975
Also,

517
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,679
he doesn't have the ability I have.

518
00:36:06,714 --> 00:36:09,350
Still, Ha Baek isn't
intimidated by me at all.

519
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,086
To be honest, I liked that about him.

520
00:36:16,658 --> 00:36:20,295
By the way, are you really okay?

521
00:36:21,729 --> 00:36:23,898
He could go back even tomorrow.

522
00:36:26,301 --> 00:36:29,437
He might be gone when you wake up.

523
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:34,841
He's back so that I can
go on living my life...

524
00:36:34,842 --> 00:36:36,511
even if that happens.

525
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,661
Are you done?

526
00:36:54,562 --> 00:36:55,597
Yes.

527
00:36:56,331 --> 00:36:58,811
50 million dollars. Tell them
that I'm giving them a discount.

528
00:37:00,335 --> 00:37:01,436
Give it to me.

529
00:37:03,438 --> 00:37:05,138
What are you doing? That's so unlike you.

530
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,407
Why is it unlike me?

531
00:37:08,176 --> 00:37:09,577
You still have a lot to learn.

532
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:13,281
Shall I show you the vast scope
of my chameleon-like charms?

533
00:37:14,449 --> 00:37:15,683
Don't.

534
00:37:16,884 --> 00:37:18,118
Don't do that.

535
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:21,022
Hold tightly onto your chest so
that your heart doesn't explode.

536
00:37:21,422 --> 00:37:22,724
I said, don't do it.

537
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,941
Gosh, seriously.

538
00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:42,377
I told you not to do it.

539
00:37:43,911 --> 00:37:45,146
How do you feel?

540
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,048
Isn't your heart racing?

541
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:48,815
Browsing on the internet...

542
00:37:48,816 --> 00:37:51,519
taught me that human women call this sexy.

543
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:55,990
Oh, boy.

544
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,199
Bend your head down, please.

545
00:38:07,835 --> 00:38:09,636
Why did you do that all of a sudden?

546
00:38:09,637 --> 00:38:12,105
- Is your heart okay?
- My heart is totally fine,

547
00:38:12,106 --> 00:38:14,409
but my four limbs are
cringing so badly right now.

548
00:38:15,977 --> 00:38:18,079
Come here. Let's have
you sit on that chair.

549
00:38:29,957 --> 00:38:32,193
Why do you keep acting
out of character today?

550
00:38:32,327 --> 00:38:34,062
Isn't it like how you...

551
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,715
peeked at me from the back in
front of the house that day?

552
00:38:36,931 --> 00:38:38,066
What?

553
00:38:38,933 --> 00:38:41,102
You said you have 40 to
50 years left to live.

554
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,939
Then you should have...

555
00:38:45,773 --> 00:38:46,974
more memories of me...

556
00:38:48,476 --> 00:38:50,611
so that you won't run out of them.

557
00:38:54,215 --> 00:38:56,451
You're so good at saying
things like that nonchalantly.

558
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:04,058
I'm not saying it because I don't care.

559
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:24,178
You know that I'm selfish, right?

560
00:39:27,248 --> 00:39:29,350
I'm telling you this because I'm selfish.

561
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:32,787
Try your best...

562
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,591
to not be lonely...

563
00:39:39,861 --> 00:39:41,295
for as long as you can.

564
00:39:51,572 --> 00:39:53,274
I will...

565
00:39:56,244 --> 00:39:58,646
remember you for a long time.

566
00:40:25,139 --> 00:40:27,408
Are you mad that he didn't
pay you 50 million dollars?

567
00:40:31,045 --> 00:40:34,182
He promised you that he'd pay
you 5,000 dollars a day.

568
00:40:34,315 --> 00:40:35,793
You should work there every single day.

569
00:40:35,817 --> 00:40:37,184
If you work 10 days,

570
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:39,253
you'd make enough to pay off the penalty.

571
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,122
If the two of us earn money together...

572
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:45,626
That actually sounded so funny.

573
00:40:49,964 --> 00:40:53,301
Let's go back there
tomorrow and the day after.

574
00:40:56,304 --> 00:40:57,972
The two of us should go there every day.

575
00:41:01,309 --> 00:41:02,777
Let's work together.

576
00:41:07,582 --> 00:41:09,050
Let's stay together.

577
00:41:11,986 --> 00:41:13,120
All right.

578
00:41:47,488 --> 00:41:48,756
Where have you been?

579
00:41:52,493 --> 00:41:54,195
Why do you look like that?

580
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:55,763
Why are you here?

581
00:41:56,397 --> 00:41:57,598
I have good news for you.

582
00:42:02,069 --> 00:42:03,204
Congratulations.

583
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,708
Oh, I got this made according
to the customs here.

584
00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:10,211
Such formality does matter, you know.

585
00:42:10,811 --> 00:42:12,691
I even picked my dress
according to this color.

586
00:42:13,047 --> 00:42:14,791
I figured I should make this much effort...

587
00:42:14,815 --> 00:42:16,817
when I deliver this kind of news to you.

588
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,220
The messenger must've been busy.

589
00:42:20,221 --> 00:42:22,490
He left without even delivering
this to you in person.

590
00:42:31,999 --> 00:42:34,201
The sixth red tide has come,

591
00:42:34,902 --> 00:42:37,238
so please get ready, Lord Ha Baek.

592
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,476
The details are inside.

593
00:42:42,877 --> 00:42:44,344
I kept them simple...

594
00:42:44,345 --> 00:42:46,881
and wrote them in big letters so
that you can read them easily.

595
00:42:51,085 --> 00:42:52,186
I'm off.

596
00:42:59,794 --> 00:43:01,696
Let me say this just in case.

597
00:43:06,267 --> 00:43:07,668
You know what will happen...

598
00:43:08,235 --> 00:43:10,037
if you choose not to go back, right?

599
00:43:59,186 --> 00:44:00,388
Let's go in.

600
00:44:04,659 --> 00:44:05,793
Come on.

601
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,762
Let's eat something. I'm hungry.

602
00:44:35,556 --> 00:44:36,791
Come and eat.

603
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:42,730
You actually look pretty
dashing even from behind.

604
00:44:54,075 --> 00:44:55,309
Come on.

605
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,097
It's not like you didn't know.

606
00:45:17,098 --> 00:45:19,734
Why do you look so sad?

607
00:45:21,736 --> 00:45:23,571
They're not asking you to return tomorrow.

608
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,048
Why do you never tell me...

609
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:37,985
not to leave even if you don't mean it?

610
00:45:41,622 --> 00:45:42,723
Why is that?

611
00:45:45,226 --> 00:45:47,161
Will you not go back if
I ask you not to leave?

612
00:45:48,896 --> 00:45:49,997
No.

613
00:45:51,031 --> 00:45:52,500
I can't do that.

614
00:45:53,634 --> 00:45:55,169
See? Exactly.

615
00:45:55,736 --> 00:45:57,872
Don't sound me out like that.

616
00:45:58,773 --> 00:46:01,308
I'm not the kind of woman
who holds men back.

617
00:46:16,924 --> 00:46:19,660
I'll tell you why I'm not stopping you.

618
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,029
Think about it.

619
00:46:22,163 --> 00:46:24,798
You're only cool because
you're the king of deities.

620
00:46:24,799 --> 00:46:27,277
You'd be nothing here if you
weren't the king and had no power.

621
00:46:27,301 --> 00:46:29,904
You'd just be a jobless person
who likes taking a warm bath.

622
00:46:30,337 --> 00:46:33,641
You don't like working, and you're
only interested in driving cars.

623
00:46:34,175 --> 00:46:35,935
I'd have to earn money
and take care of you.

624
00:46:39,113 --> 00:46:41,581
Don't watch those kinds of movies
where the main characters...

625
00:46:41,582 --> 00:46:44,018
fall in love and say they
don't care about money.

626
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:47,221
If a man acts that way, they'll
get abandoned by their lady.

627
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:02,903
My goodness.

628
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:07,241
My gosh, how is he going to be a king...

629
00:47:07,708 --> 00:47:09,610
with such a sensitive heart?

630
00:49:04,892 --> 00:49:06,026
Lord Ha Baek.

631
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,001
- I'm home.
- Why did you come so late?

632
00:49:15,002 --> 00:49:17,771
There are so many places I can work
at, now that I have an ID card.

633
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:20,111
The 24-hour barbecue place
asked me to work there today.

634
00:49:20,975 --> 00:49:22,608
In the morning, I worked
part-time by the river...

635
00:49:22,609 --> 00:49:24,777
- Stop working part-time.
- Pardon?

636
00:49:24,778 --> 00:49:26,080
I've received a message.

637
00:49:27,147 --> 00:49:28,781
Then does that mean we're
really going to go back?

638
00:49:28,782 --> 00:49:30,327
Notify that you're going to
stop working part-time...

639
00:49:30,351 --> 00:49:32,051
so that the same thing won't happen again.

640
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,187
Okay.

641
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:03,751
Are you that happy?

642
00:50:05,352 --> 00:50:07,521
You should've seen the look on his face.

643
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:09,389
I thought the skies were
going to fall down.

644
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:12,792
Ha Baek really must've
gotten on your bad side.

645
00:50:12,793 --> 00:50:15,228
I even thought about not telling
him about the message...

646
00:50:15,229 --> 00:50:18,265
so that he'll be able to
just stay here forever.

647
00:50:20,734 --> 00:50:22,769
That's a bit too harsh, even if
you only said that out of anger.

648
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:25,506
Ha Baek will die if he
doesn't become the king.

649
00:50:26,006 --> 00:50:27,841
Will you be able to live without him?

650
00:50:28,242 --> 00:50:32,980
Ha Baek knows that too. That's why
he's not hesitating on going back.

651
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,583
So just cut him some slack.

652
00:50:37,151 --> 00:50:38,285
You're so annoying.

653
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,989
Who do you like more? Me or Ha Baek?

654
00:50:44,825 --> 00:50:45,825
(Please be mine, Hye Ra.)

655
00:50:45,826 --> 00:50:47,928
Tell me. Who do you like more?

656
00:50:48,695 --> 00:50:51,198
You...

657
00:50:53,767 --> 00:50:54,868
What?

658
00:50:59,073 --> 00:51:00,606
Me? Not Ha Baek?

659
00:51:00,607 --> 00:51:01,775
Yes, I'm talking to you.

660
00:51:05,279 --> 00:51:06,947
- What's that?
- What?

661
00:51:09,016 --> 00:51:10,184
(Please be mine, Hye Ra.)

662
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,220
This?

663
00:51:15,422 --> 00:51:17,590
- It's a gift from your fans.
- What?

664
00:51:17,591 --> 00:51:20,303
I heard you got angry at your fans
and told them not to give you gifts.

665
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:23,263
I heard they're too scared of
you to give their gifts to you.

666
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:25,598
Well, yes.

667
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:28,202
But they apparently keep sending you gifts,

668
00:51:28,302 --> 00:51:30,170
and Mr. Kim didn't know
what to do about them.

669
00:51:30,604 --> 00:51:32,171
So I told him to give them to me.

670
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:34,141
I like anything that has your face on it.

671
00:51:45,319 --> 00:51:47,054
(I'll protect you, Hye Ra.)

672
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,758
By the way, about that
gift box in your room...

673
00:51:52,593 --> 00:51:56,396
Yes, that one. I ate some
snacks from that box.

674
00:51:57,431 --> 00:51:59,066
Okay, good job.

675
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,569
But why do you have that?

676
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:06,273
What? Well...

677
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:09,275
I told Mr. Kim to throw everything away.

678
00:52:09,276 --> 00:52:10,636
He must've put it back here again.

679
00:52:12,246 --> 00:52:14,081
What would he know?

680
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:17,684
You're a deity, so you don't
need the love of human beings.

681
00:52:18,752 --> 00:52:21,321
These pair of socks would
only feel like a joke to you.

682
00:52:21,588 --> 00:52:23,924
You even look down on my diamond gifts.
Aren't I right?

683
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:25,659
Right.

684
00:52:28,595 --> 00:52:32,666
These kind of things are
just for lowly human beings.

685
00:52:33,534 --> 00:52:35,068
There. I'll take it.

686
00:52:35,502 --> 00:52:37,337
I like it because it has your face on it.

687
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:21,148
What are you doing?

688
00:53:23,217 --> 00:53:24,384
Where are you going?

689
00:53:26,587 --> 00:53:27,921
Do you want to go with me?

690
00:53:37,197 --> 00:53:38,365
This is where...

691
00:53:40,167 --> 00:53:42,402
I had made a foolish mistake.

692
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:47,908
It was 11:35pm at December 20, 2004.

693
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,744
I even remember the exact time.

694
00:53:54,014 --> 00:53:55,916
After my dad left home,

695
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:59,820
I studied hard in order to become happy.

696
00:54:01,121 --> 00:54:02,889
It was just like what you told me.

697
00:54:03,624 --> 00:54:07,394
I only believed what I wanted to believe.

698
00:54:08,028 --> 00:54:12,298
Like you said, that made things
much easier to cope with.

699
00:54:12,299 --> 00:54:14,067
Your dad abandoned us.

700
00:54:14,534 --> 00:54:15,768
Just think of it that way.

701
00:54:15,769 --> 00:54:18,404
If I hadn't done that, I would've
had to spend my whole youth...

702
00:54:18,405 --> 00:54:20,641
trying to understand my dad.

703
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:22,776
But...

704
00:54:23,944 --> 00:54:27,648
even my mom was struggling to
endure the hardship behind my back.

705
00:54:29,549 --> 00:54:31,418
I really hated her.

706
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:36,189
I was doing a good job of hanging
in there even after my mom died.

707
00:54:37,324 --> 00:54:38,492
Even on that day,

708
00:54:39,593 --> 00:54:41,895
I was doing fine and studying at school.

709
00:54:43,563 --> 00:54:45,265
But suddenly,

710
00:54:46,767 --> 00:54:48,268
this strange feeling took over me.

711
00:54:50,437 --> 00:54:52,406
It suddenly came to me,

712
00:54:53,273 --> 00:54:55,976
instantly took over my thoughts,

713
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:00,113
and pushed me from this bridge.

714
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:08,689
"When there's so much love in this
world, why didn't the deity..."

715
00:55:11,425 --> 00:55:13,593
"save any love for me?"

716
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:17,364
"Why did the deity leave me out?"

717
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:20,767
"Why..."

718
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:25,839
"does the deity only hate me?"

719
00:55:32,446 --> 00:55:34,481
If my dad picked up the phone,

720
00:55:34,681 --> 00:55:36,750
that would mean the deity loves me.

721
00:55:37,718 --> 00:55:39,529
If he doesn't,

722
00:55:39,553 --> 00:55:40,686
that would mean the deity...

723
00:55:40,687 --> 00:55:42,522
- really hates me.
- Dad...

724
00:55:43,557 --> 00:55:45,192
That's what I decided to think.

725
00:55:46,059 --> 00:55:47,160
Please...

726
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:57,304
The receiver cannot answer your call.
Please leave a message...

727
00:55:59,239 --> 00:56:02,309
My dad's cell phone never turned on again.

728
00:56:06,246 --> 00:56:10,917
So I decided to take revenge on
him in the most terrible way.

729
00:56:12,652 --> 00:56:15,055
I'm going to make you regret
for the rest of your life.

730
00:56:21,328 --> 00:56:26,133
Of course, it just ended up becoming
my most embarrassing memory.

731
00:56:33,006 --> 00:56:34,207
Once again,

732
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:39,045
I need to say goodbye to someone I love.

733
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:44,050
I wanted to know how I really feel.

734
00:56:46,052 --> 00:56:47,220
I wanted to know...

735
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:51,258
if I still felt like how I did
when I jumped from this bridge,

736
00:56:53,026 --> 00:56:54,094
or if...

737
00:56:56,229 --> 00:56:57,898
I had matured and become an adult.

738
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:01,601
I wanted to check.

739
00:57:08,375 --> 00:57:09,910
Thank you for...

740
00:57:11,378 --> 00:57:12,579
giving me your love.

741
00:57:40,941 --> 00:57:42,742
Let's go home and eat.

742
00:57:51,084 --> 00:57:53,124
So this is better laid out
than the other proposal.

743
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:57,390
Hey, I've been giving it some thought.

744
00:57:57,491 --> 00:57:59,125
And I can't seem to know your intention.

745
00:58:00,527 --> 00:58:01,727
Why do you look like that?

746
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,362
Did you say you want me to
become a decent human being?

747
00:58:03,363 --> 00:58:05,698
I'm a human being who has
22 pairs of autosomes...

748
00:58:05,699 --> 00:58:08,735
and one pair of X chromosomes.

749
00:58:09,202 --> 00:58:10,736
You told me to become a human being,

750
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:13,874
so I thought there could be a
hidden message behind that.

751
00:58:14,341 --> 00:58:17,310
So I even ended up
studying the DNA sequence.

752
00:58:22,449 --> 00:58:23,950
My head's burning right now.

753
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:27,287
And I took countless pills
to get rid of my headache.

754
00:58:27,387 --> 00:58:30,166
It's been a while since I've
graduated, so I forgot everything.

755
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:33,260
Why did you make me study everything again?

756
00:58:35,562 --> 00:58:36,630
Ja Ya.

757
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:38,898
What's wrong with you?

758
00:58:38,899 --> 00:58:41,535
He's looking down on me.

759
00:58:41,668 --> 00:58:43,235
I know he goes to church,

760
00:58:43,236 --> 00:58:45,038
but why is he trying to make me study?

761
00:58:45,906 --> 00:58:47,740
Did you get orders from my grandpa?

762
00:58:47,741 --> 00:58:50,176
That's what happened, right?
How much did you get from him?

763
00:58:52,746 --> 00:58:53,946
You received money, didn't you?

764
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:56,816
Hey, say something. You got
money from him, right?

765
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,486
How much did you get? Did you get a lot?

766
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:02,756
Let me go.

767
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:04,591
Are you stupid?

768
00:59:05,058 --> 00:59:06,392
What does the DNA sequence...

769
00:59:06,393 --> 00:59:08,427
have anything to do with kicking Ms.
Yoon out of the building?

770
00:59:08,428 --> 00:59:10,297
That's exactly what I want to ask you.

771
00:59:10,664 --> 00:59:12,399
Do you have feelings for So Ah?

772
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,101
Ja Ya.

773
00:59:15,569 --> 00:59:18,238
You should quit your job.

774
00:59:18,438 --> 00:59:20,906
Your job requires intelligence,

775
00:59:20,907 --> 00:59:22,709
but it also requires you
to have a big heart.

776
00:59:23,843 --> 00:59:24,945
What are you saying?

777
00:59:26,046 --> 00:59:28,582
I'm not interested in
becoming a sexy celebrity.

778
00:59:31,785 --> 00:59:33,786
You should learn how to
have a bigger heart...

779
00:59:33,787 --> 00:59:35,221
and become a decent human being.

780
00:59:37,557 --> 00:59:39,492
"A bigger heart"?

781
00:59:40,026 --> 00:59:41,795
"A decent human being"?

782
00:59:42,429 --> 00:59:44,664
Why is the list getting longer?

783
00:59:48,868 --> 00:59:51,838
(The one and only, Hye Ra)

784
00:59:57,777 --> 00:59:58,945
What's wrong?

785
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:00,880
Is this your first time seeing me topless?

786
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:05,285
Did you also get that towel from my fan?

787
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,656
Yes, it's really nice.
It has your name on it.

788
01:00:30,944 --> 01:00:32,679
My gosh, what's wrong with him?

789
01:00:33,613 --> 01:00:35,348
I don't even have a lot of them.

790
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:52,699
(Hye Ra is mine.)

791
01:00:56,469 --> 01:00:57,636
What are you doing?

792
01:00:57,637 --> 01:01:00,206
Hey, this moisturizer is really nice.

793
01:01:00,974 --> 01:01:02,042
You...

794
01:01:03,109 --> 01:01:04,177
What?

795
01:01:11,351 --> 01:01:12,519
What's wrong?

796
01:01:12,952 --> 01:01:14,688
- Is that...
- Are you angry...

797
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:17,090
- that I'm using these gifts from...
- No.

798
01:01:18,158 --> 01:01:20,393
- Why would I be angry?
- Didn't you say that...

799
01:01:20,794 --> 01:01:21,860
you hate getting gifts from humans?

800
01:01:21,861 --> 01:01:24,230
Yes, I hate them. They're filthy.

801
01:01:26,499 --> 01:01:29,235
Just tell them that you want
them to give you gifts again.

802
01:01:29,736 --> 01:01:31,671
Why are you being so
stubborn for no reason?

803
01:01:31,905 --> 01:01:34,307
- It's all useless.
- What do you know?

804
01:01:44,517 --> 01:01:46,519
I didn't know anything until a moment ago,

805
01:01:46,753 --> 01:01:48,421
but now I do.

806
01:01:57,731 --> 01:01:59,332
The design isn't that pretty.

807
01:02:05,338 --> 01:02:06,973
Do I have 50 steps or 100 steps left?

808
01:02:08,208 --> 01:02:10,577
Or could I already be inside her heart?

809
01:02:11,845 --> 01:02:14,948
I'll try confronting your sincerity.

810
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,660
Get lost.

811
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:40,006
Okay.

812
01:02:40,907 --> 01:02:43,209
I guess she's not that
interested in diamond rings.

813
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:44,911
Let's get her a gold ring.

814
01:02:45,545 --> 01:02:47,347
A gold ring.

815
01:02:59,058 --> 01:03:01,294
What are you doing here at this hour?
What's wrong?

816
01:03:02,595 --> 01:03:04,764
I finally solved the last puzzle.

817
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:05,864
What?

818
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:07,767
I told you that I keep
seeing you in my dream.

819
01:03:08,434 --> 01:03:09,902
Are you here to talk about that again?

820
01:03:09,903 --> 01:03:11,703
Have a meal while you're here.

821
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:13,639
Eating isn't important right now.

822
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,040
No, that's all I care about right now.

823
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,508
It would've been nice if you didn't come,

824
01:03:16,509 --> 01:03:19,279
but I can't send back
the only friend I have.

825
01:03:21,748 --> 01:03:23,650
But you really are a nuisance.

826
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:25,094
I told you, didn't I?

827
01:03:25,118 --> 01:03:26,451
At first, all I could see was...

828
01:03:26,452 --> 01:03:29,422
a blurry image of someone coming
up to me and saying something.

829
01:03:29,589 --> 01:03:31,534
For some reason, it felt like it was you.

830
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:32,658
But guess what?

831
01:03:32,659 --> 01:03:35,060
A few days later, you came to
me all wet because of the rain,

832
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:36,361
but I still couldn't hear
what you were saying.

833
01:03:36,362 --> 01:03:39,232
But a few days ago, I
could finally hear you.

834
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:41,701
That person...

835
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:44,870
Yes, keep going. Who are you talking about?

836
01:03:44,871 --> 01:03:46,339
That person...

837
01:03:52,378 --> 01:03:54,214
is the person who saved me.

838
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:56,516
It was him.

839
01:03:57,517 --> 01:03:58,685
But...

840
01:03:59,219 --> 01:04:01,654
So I naturally thought that
it was your boyfriend.

841
01:04:03,389 --> 01:04:05,624
I got angry at you for boasting
about your boyfriend in my dream.

842
01:04:05,625 --> 01:04:07,192
You can check with Soo Ri.

843
01:04:07,193 --> 01:04:09,261
Yeom Mi, hurry up and get to the point.

844
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:11,330
I need to serve the rice now.

845
01:04:11,331 --> 01:04:12,832
You said, "But".

846
01:04:14,167 --> 01:04:15,969
- "But"?
- Yes.

847
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:18,638
You said, "But".

848
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:20,371
That means there's something unexpected.

849
01:04:40,593 --> 01:04:42,394
That "But" kept bothering me.

850
01:04:42,395 --> 01:04:45,265
But I really couldn't hear anything
after that. It was so frustrating.

851
01:04:45,398 --> 01:04:48,034
- Is it like "The Usual Suspect"?
- It's more shocking than that.

852
01:04:48,268 --> 01:04:49,535
Anyway,

853
01:04:51,271 --> 01:04:54,274
a moment ago, I was able to
hear that mysterious part.

854
01:04:55,008 --> 01:04:57,710
Okay, congratulations. So what did I say?

855
01:04:58,444 --> 01:05:00,213
You said something shocking.

856
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:03,115
"That person is the one who saved me."

857
01:05:03,116 --> 01:05:04,317
"But..."

858
01:05:04,684 --> 01:05:06,686
That person is...

859
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:08,721
the one who saved me.

860
01:05:09,923 --> 01:05:12,592
- But...
- But that person who saved you...

861
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:14,861
But the person who saved me...

862
01:05:15,261 --> 01:05:18,665
is going to be the deity
that takes away my soul.

863
01:05:19,198 --> 01:05:20,966
- What?
- You said the person...

864
01:05:20,967 --> 01:05:23,379
who saved you is going to be the
deity that takes away your soul.

865
01:05:23,403 --> 01:05:24,871
That means you're going to die.

866
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:28,341
What?

867
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:08,982
(The Bride of Habaek)

868
01:06:09,549 --> 01:06:11,049
Ms. Descendant is going to die?

869
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:12,318
No.

870
01:06:12,452 --> 01:06:13,952
Today will be the last day.

871
01:06:13,953 --> 01:06:15,822
Why does this have to happen to me?

872
01:06:15,989 --> 01:06:19,092
You're going to use that
remaining power on her?

873
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:21,293
It's the deity's duty to protect humans.

874
01:06:21,294 --> 01:06:22,627
If you fail to become the king...

875
01:06:22,628 --> 01:06:24,162
What will happen if I die?

876
01:06:24,163 --> 01:06:25,397
Stop talking nonsense.

877
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:28,934
How can I call myself a king if I
can't even save that one woman?

878
01:06:28,935 --> 01:06:30,635
How is that more important than your death?

879
01:06:30,636 --> 01:06:33,238
- You're going to die?
- I told you that I'll protect you.

880
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:35,907
You're going to disappear from my memory?

881
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:37,076
I love you.
