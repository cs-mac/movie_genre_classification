1
00:02:12,102 --> 00:02:14,741
- All right, Weinkoop, where is she?
- In this car, sir.

2
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,696
- Has she recovered consciousness?
- Not sir, not yet.

3
00:02:16,697 --> 00:02:17,867
This is the company doctor.

4
00:02:17,868 --> 00:02:19,504
- Follow me, doctor
- Come on, Doc.

5
00:02:28,304 --> 00:02:31,278
Five minutes out of Port Johnson
she went into the ladies' room.

6
00:02:31,362 --> 00:02:34,313
- Must've finished off a pint.
- The telegram said she fell.

7
00:02:34,348 --> 00:02:36,315
Rolled off the seat
like a sack of flour.

8
00:02:42,845 --> 00:02:45,603
- Well?
- She's dead drunk.

9
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,607
I'll say something else in my report
if you want, but that's what it is.

10
00:02:51,148 --> 00:02:52,362
Should be in a hospital.

11
00:02:52,382 --> 00:02:55,023
Anything to get her
off company property. Come on, Doc.

12
00:02:59,427 --> 00:03:02,481
Have her taken to the Jefferson
Hospital. You go with her.

13
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,706
Be sure you make it straight with the people
there that we're not taking any responsibility.

14
00:03:06,845 --> 00:03:09,564
We're doing this only as a courtesy
to her husband, and that's all.

15
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,836
Put her in a private room
under another name.

16
00:03:11,837 --> 00:03:15,227
Keep her there until I get
Sam Eaton to come take her home.

17
00:03:15,685 --> 00:03:17,038
Very well, Mr Jones.

18
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:21,516
There's more to running a railroad than
just laying down some tracks, doctor.

19
00:03:22,163 --> 00:03:25,056
- Ah, looking for quail, Frolick, as usual?
- As usual, DD.

20
00:03:25,633 --> 00:03:28,842
You won't find any around here.
They're all down on Market Street by now.

21
00:03:29,005 --> 00:03:31,963
- Nobody left on that train?
- No, no, just the crew.

22
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:35,095
I wonder if...

23
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:39,200
Oh, no. Not Martha Eaton.

24
00:03:41,963 --> 00:03:43,261
See you later.

25
00:03:46,597 --> 00:03:48,046
This is DD Jones.

26
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:51,376
I want you to put in a long-distance
call to Port Johnson.

27
00:03:52,021 --> 00:03:53,606
To Mr Samuel Eaton.

28
00:03:54,445 --> 00:03:56,879
That's right, Eaton Iron and Steel.

29
00:03:57,045 --> 00:04:00,037
Will you be home for dinner,
Mr Eaton, if anyone should ask?

30
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:02,377
If you mean by "anyone" Mrs Eaton...

31
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:05,523
Say so, Nellie, or
forever hold your peace.

32
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,234
Well, I was only thinking what with
Mr Alfred coming home from the war today.

33
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,062
Oh, you're sure it's today, are you?

34
00:04:11,123 --> 00:04:12,944
Maybe you even know what time
he's coming.

35
00:04:13,183 --> 00:04:14,509
Or how he's coming.

36
00:04:14,636 --> 00:04:18,151
No reason why a servant shouldn't know
more than his own family.

37
00:04:18,818 --> 00:04:21,574
Those eggs were too hard
again today, Nellie.

38
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,489
When I say soft-boiled,
I mean soft-boiled. - Yes, Mr Eaton.

39
00:04:25,638 --> 00:04:28,540
The answer is: I may be home,
and then again, I may not.

40
00:04:28,605 --> 00:04:31,677
- And now I'm off. Goodbye, Nellie.
- Goodbye, sir.

41
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,447
Hello. Eaton residence.

42
00:04:50,245 --> 00:04:52,600
Oh, I'm sorry. He just left.

43
00:04:53,037 --> 00:04:55,813
You should be able to reach him
at the mill in about 10 minutes.

44
00:04:56,553 --> 00:04:58,225
You're welcome. Goodbye.

45
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:03,193
Mrs Eaton got out of the house
mighty early this morning, George.

46
00:05:03,997 --> 00:05:04,974
Yes, sir.

47
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:07,134
Philadelphia again?

48
00:05:07,485 --> 00:05:10,081
I didn't wait to see
which train she took, sir.

49
00:05:10,925 --> 00:05:12,324
Didn't she say anything?

50
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:14,246
We were too busy
talking about your boy...

51
00:05:14,294 --> 00:05:18,629
Coming out of the Navy alive and well to be
concerning ourselves with unimportant matters.

52
00:05:18,805 --> 00:05:22,015
In other words, Mrs Eaton's
whereabouts are too unimportant...

53
00:05:22,116 --> 00:05:23,794
For me to have any interest in them.

54
00:05:23,911 --> 00:05:26,370
There's nothing about Mrs Eaton
that's unimportant.

55
00:05:26,664 --> 00:05:28,124
At least, not to me, sir.

56
00:05:28,285 --> 00:05:30,879
Are you trying to say something
to me, George?

57
00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:32,218
Well, sir...

58
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:35,197
I made me a promise
the day your son went away.

59
00:05:35,713 --> 00:05:37,385
"George Fry", I said,

60
00:05:38,174 --> 00:05:40,290
'The day Alfred comes
home from this war,

61
00:05:40,636 --> 00:05:43,370
you'll say some things
that's been wanting to be said."

62
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:45,594
Took a lot for granted, didn't you?

63
00:05:45,998 --> 00:05:47,502
I knew he was coming back.

64
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:48,979
I prayed for him.

65
00:05:49,598 --> 00:05:50,872
You prayed?

66
00:05:51,405 --> 00:05:53,976
You're no more
of a praying man than I am.

67
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,512
If it was Billy gone to war
instead of Alfred...

68
00:05:56,585 --> 00:05:58,863
Maybe you'd have learned
to pray, Mr Eaton.

69
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:02,171
Is that what you promised
yourself to say?

70
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:05,314
A father can feel badly
over a son dead 13 years...

71
00:06:05,385 --> 00:06:06,802
Without ignoring the other one.

72
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:09,389
Don't preach to me, George.

73
00:06:09,743 --> 00:06:10,902
No, sir.

74
00:06:11,758 --> 00:06:13,984
Maybe you'd better be taking the day off.

75
00:06:14,205 --> 00:06:16,321
I'll accept the day's holiday, sir,

76
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:19,886
But after that, I don't want to work
for you anymore, Mr Eaton.

77
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,871
No, I shouldn't think you would.

78
00:06:22,588 --> 00:06:25,059
I'll have your check ready
for you tomorrow morning.

79
00:06:25,823 --> 00:06:27,011
Yes, sir.

80
00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:30,429
You might as well stop
in front of the saloon...

81
00:06:30,513 --> 00:06:31,907
When we get there and get out.

82
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:34,717
That's where you'll be going anyway,
I'm sure.

83
00:06:40,405 --> 00:06:42,220
Here's to Samuel Eaton...

84
00:06:43,188 --> 00:06:45,476
President of Eaton Iron and Steel...

85
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,647
Who, after 20-some odd years
of being...

86
00:06:48,732 --> 00:06:51,141
Dirty, rotten mean to his boy Alfred...

87
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:53,102
Has just been fired.

88
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:56,764
I said fired, Noony...
By his own chauffeur.

89
00:06:56,837 --> 00:06:58,155
I'll drink to that.

90
00:07:02,045 --> 00:07:04,122
And here's to Alfred Eaton...

91
00:07:05,045 --> 00:07:07,340
Who never did anything wrong
in his whole life,

92
00:07:08,164 --> 00:07:10,949
Except be the son who didn't die
of spinal meningitis...

93
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,401
When he was a kid.

94
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:17,740
And now...

95
00:07:18,795 --> 00:07:21,858
I hope he'll be forgiven
for living through the war.

96
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:06,078
You know where North Hill Road is?

97
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:10,494
Hey, Jake. Got a passenger
for out of town.

98
00:08:10,566 --> 00:08:11,693
Good!

99
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:31,016
Don't you want to
help me with my bags?

100
00:08:31,074 --> 00:08:32,326
Who says so?

101
00:08:37,189 --> 00:08:38,350
How much do I owe you?

102
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,342
3 dollars.

103
00:08:42,705 --> 00:08:46,087
- Oh, yeah? Who says so?
- I said so. 3 dollars.

104
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,526
Wait here for a minute while
I go and telephone.

105
00:08:54,605 --> 00:08:55,789
Telephone who?

106
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:58,359
The taxi company, I want to find out
when they raised their prices.

107
00:08:58,494 --> 00:08:59,621
2 dollars.

108
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:02,138
Here's one dollar.

109
00:09:03,197 --> 00:09:05,283
Go ahead, beat it before
I pull you out of that cab...

110
00:09:05,284 --> 00:09:06,537
And bust your nose for you.

111
00:09:06,642 --> 00:09:08,308
Well, big man.

112
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:20,786
Oh, Mr Alfred!

113
00:09:20,787 --> 00:09:23,532
- Oh, Mr Alfred!
- Hello, Josephine. Hello, Nellie.

114
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:25,369
Stop, Nellie, for
the Lord's sake.

115
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:27,656
I can't help it.

116
00:09:28,005 --> 00:09:29,754
Well, you all look fine.

117
00:09:30,438 --> 00:09:32,146
Come on, now.
Turn around, Josephine.

118
00:09:32,147 --> 00:09:33,868
I will not.

119
00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:36,696
You don't have to.
I can see it's getting bigger.

120
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,795
- It is not.
- She don't have her corset on.

121
00:09:39,258 --> 00:09:41,147
Shut your mouth, for the Lord's sake.

122
00:09:45,623 --> 00:09:48,026
I brought you two old crows
some presents from London.

123
00:09:48,084 --> 00:09:50,393
You didn't have to spend
your money on us.

124
00:09:50,469 --> 00:09:52,454
We're just thankful
you're home.

125
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,154
And I'll bet you are, too.

126
00:10:04,585 --> 00:10:07,683
You didn't tell a soul
what time you were coming.

127
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,338
I didn't want to give anybody
a chance not to meet me.

128
00:10:11,603 --> 00:10:13,625
We aren't really ready for you,
Mr Alfred...

129
00:10:13,626 --> 00:10:15,612
What with the mister
and missis away.

130
00:10:16,177 --> 00:10:17,095
Away?

131
00:10:17,096 --> 00:10:19,738
Tonight I don't have only
some lamb chops...

132
00:10:19,764 --> 00:10:22,189
But I did make a nice
apple pie, though.

133
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,795
Where did they go?

134
00:10:24,849 --> 00:10:27,727
The missis went away this morning.
I don't know where.

135
00:10:28,246 --> 00:10:30,127
The mister he called
this afternoon.

136
00:10:30,128 --> 00:10:31,566
It sounded like long distance.

137
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:33,791
And he said, "Don't wait with dinner."

138
00:10:33,871 --> 00:10:36,458
So we fixed for Miss Trimingham early.

139
00:10:36,596 --> 00:10:37,631
Miss Trimingham?

140
00:10:37,677 --> 00:10:40,622
Yes. Come on, Josephine.
Help me with these bags.

141
00:10:41,481 --> 00:10:46,032
You'll find your old room, just exactly
the way you left it, Mr Alfred.

142
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:49,250
Nellie, who's Miss Trimingham?

143
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:52,993
She's your mother's
trained nurse.

144
00:10:53,906 --> 00:10:55,423
Trained nurse?

145
00:10:57,588 --> 00:10:59,348
For the drinking, Mr Alfred.

146
00:11:55,712 --> 00:11:57,270
Alfred!

147
00:11:59,423 --> 00:12:01,618
Oh, my Alfred!

148
00:12:04,953 --> 00:12:06,591
Mother, you all right?

149
00:12:07,253 --> 00:12:10,370
Oh, forgive me. How horrible.

150
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,022
I'm so excited and awkward.

151
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,100
- Oh, but you're home.
- Yes, Mother.

152
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:22,095
Oh, darling, don't. Don't look at me.

153
00:12:23,485 --> 00:12:25,747
I didn't want you to see me
like this.

154
00:12:26,525 --> 00:12:29,642
I'm so tired,
and I'm not feeling well.

155
00:12:30,888 --> 00:12:34,568
Couldn't we save everything for
tomorrow, when I'll be at my best?

156
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:37,749
We'll make believe
there was no tonight...

157
00:12:38,061 --> 00:12:39,733
And that you came home tomorrow and...

158
00:12:39,948 --> 00:12:42,578
We'll say all our hellos
just as they should be.

159
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:44,141
Sure, Mother.

160
00:12:46,173 --> 00:12:47,551
Here comes your father.

161
00:12:47,781 --> 00:12:49,046
Now make allowances.

162
00:12:49,105 --> 00:12:51,665
He's not at his... best.

163
00:12:52,926 --> 00:12:56,441
Here we are, Sam,
and look who's with me.

164
00:12:57,596 --> 00:13:00,341
- My boy. Home at last.
- Hello, Father.

165
00:13:01,244 --> 00:13:03,774
Hello, Father?
Is that all after all this time?

166
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,913
No. There's a lot more.

167
00:13:06,365 --> 00:13:08,306
Yes, I should think
there would be.

168
00:13:10,633 --> 00:13:12,213
Now what've you
done to yourself?

169
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:13,382
She just tripped and fell.

170
00:13:13,403 --> 00:13:15,740
Doesn't he look wonderful?

171
00:13:15,766 --> 00:13:18,178
Yes. Let's get in the house.

172
00:13:20,524 --> 00:13:23,600
Now, Sam, what we've decided is...

173
00:13:23,685 --> 00:13:25,996
We're not going to
say our hellos tonight.

174
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,316
We're all much too tired

175
00:13:28,554 --> 00:13:30,963
and tomorrow
we'll all be fresh as a daisy.

176
00:13:32,025 --> 00:13:33,465
How was the war?

177
00:13:35,046 --> 00:13:36,673
OK, I guess. We won it.

178
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:44,238
Oh, have you met my son?

179
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:46,595
Alfred, this is Miss Trimingham.

180
00:13:46,653 --> 00:13:48,769
- How do you do?
- Welcome home.

181
00:13:49,642 --> 00:13:51,094
Up we go.

182
00:13:54,465 --> 00:13:57,085
Cool sheets and heavenly rest.

183
00:13:57,604 --> 00:13:59,127
Good night, Alfred.

184
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,424
Sleep as late as you like...

185
00:14:01,816 --> 00:14:05,012
And remember...
You're coming home tomorrow.

186
00:14:05,551 --> 00:14:08,048
Tonight never even happened.

187
00:14:18,365 --> 00:14:19,958
The house looks good.

188
00:14:20,343 --> 00:14:21,391
Yeah.

189
00:14:21,803 --> 00:14:24,684
Your mother touched it up
a bit here and there.

190
00:14:27,001 --> 00:14:28,793
You've put on a
couple of pounds.

191
00:14:29,413 --> 00:14:30,977
Soft living in the Navy.

192
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,787
I suppose you're sleepy.

193
00:14:35,462 --> 00:14:37,344
I was up at quarter to 6:oo
this morning.

194
00:14:37,404 --> 00:14:39,480
Not a very good time to talk now
anyway, is it?

195
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:43,783
No, I guess it isn't.

196
00:14:45,582 --> 00:14:47,378
I guess I'll go upstairs, too.

197
00:14:47,735 --> 00:14:49,331
If it's all right with you.

198
00:14:50,605 --> 00:14:51,698
Father?

199
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:53,921
Yeah?

200
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,220
Nothing. Good night.

201
00:15:01,555 --> 00:15:02,826
Good night.

202
00:15:16,977 --> 00:15:18,627
She doesn't need you now.

203
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:28,245
Well, Mr Alfred, how does it feel
to be home again and...

204
00:15:28,306 --> 00:15:30,250
Seeing your mother and father?

205
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:35,118
Things don't change, Nellie.
They just get more so.

206
00:15:35,672 --> 00:15:38,990
We got ginger ale, seltzer, glasses
and no liquor. Where's the liquor?

207
00:15:39,349 --> 00:15:41,579
Your father keeps it
under lock and key.

208
00:15:42,754 --> 00:15:45,084
- Good night, Mr Alfred.
- Good night.

209
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:51,083
Even the servants in your own house,
know about you.

210
00:15:51,135 --> 00:15:55,014
I'm tired. I'm sick. Leave me alone.

211
00:15:55,075 --> 00:15:58,385
I'll leave you alone when you tell
me everything I want to know.

212
00:15:58,452 --> 00:16:02,240
- Who else saw you together?
- Nobody else. Not a soul.

213
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:05,911
- You were in restaurants together.
- Never.

214
00:16:05,969 --> 00:16:07,880
Wallowing in filth together!

215
00:16:08,518 --> 00:16:12,397
And I want to know where
every damn place! - No.

216
00:16:13,245 --> 00:16:14,783
Well, you're going to tell me.

217
00:16:15,044 --> 00:16:18,252
Oh no, Sam, not tonight.
Please!

218
00:16:18,303 --> 00:16:20,256
Where else did you meet him?

219
00:16:21,171 --> 00:16:24,297
Nowhere else. Only his house.

220
00:16:24,365 --> 00:16:26,905
You're lying to me.
You were with him in a hotel room.

221
00:16:27,836 --> 00:16:29,338
All right!

222
00:16:30,012 --> 00:16:30,980
But only once.

223
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:34,167
You could stay with him
and me the same night?

224
00:16:37,422 --> 00:16:38,457
Yes!

225
00:16:38,688 --> 00:16:39,934
Yes!

226
00:16:43,624 --> 00:16:45,103
Did you think you're any better...

227
00:16:45,265 --> 00:16:46,960
Than one of those sluts
on River Street?

228
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,812
I'm not proud of myself.

229
00:16:51,918 --> 00:16:53,934
Not proud of herself, she says.

230
00:16:55,158 --> 00:16:57,972
How can you look
at your own son?

231
00:16:57,998 --> 00:16:59,384
I can't.

232
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,331
If that egotistical little
father of yours

233
00:17:01,332 --> 00:17:02,816
Was alive to know about this...

234
00:17:03,505 --> 00:17:04,922
Your son.

235
00:17:05,645 --> 00:17:07,476
Your father.

236
00:17:07,525 --> 00:17:09,171
Your heroes.

237
00:17:10,175 --> 00:17:14,312
I have no heroes,
only some people I love.

238
00:17:14,965 --> 00:17:17,035
- You were my hero.
- Shut up!

239
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,634
And you drove me to it.

240
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,003
You turned your back on me
just like you did on Alfred.

241
00:17:24,011 --> 00:17:27,760
I needed love...
Wherever I could find it.

242
00:17:28,155 --> 00:17:29,804
Love!

243
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,858
You're a pig.

244
00:17:33,327 --> 00:17:35,422
I can't stand the sight of you.

245
00:17:41,172 --> 00:17:42,301
Mr Eaton.

246
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:50,979
His name is Charles Frolick.

247
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,198
He's a terrible, evil man.

248
00:17:54,224 --> 00:17:56,248
How long has it been going on?

249
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,169
About a year.

250
00:17:59,065 --> 00:18:01,888
She's been trying not to see him,
but he won't let her.

251
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,215
She can't help herself.

252
00:18:06,057 --> 00:18:07,288
Frolick?

253
00:18:08,632 --> 00:18:12,739
Number 22 Walnut Street,
Philadelphia.

254
00:18:21,865 --> 00:18:24,209
- Yes, what is it?
- Are you Charles Frolick?

255
00:18:24,514 --> 00:18:27,472
I am. What kind
of an hour of the night...

256
00:18:27,912 --> 00:18:30,777
- Who the devil are you?
- Charlie.

257
00:18:31,205 --> 00:18:33,059
What do you think
you're doing here anyway?

258
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:35,000
Charlie!

259
00:18:42,485 --> 00:18:43,863
My name is Alfred Eaton.

260
00:18:43,967 --> 00:18:45,634
Alfred Eaton. You got that?

261
00:18:46,967 --> 00:18:49,034
Now, you go near my mother
again, I'll kill you.

262
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,408
Charlie? What's the big idea
of keeping me...

263
00:18:55,286 --> 00:18:56,606
Charlie!

264
00:19:05,802 --> 00:19:07,007
Mr Alfred down yet?

265
00:19:07,033 --> 00:19:08,746
He's having breakfast, sir.

266
00:19:12,597 --> 00:19:14,098
There you are, boy.

267
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:18,534
Watch those eggs, Nellie.

268
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:20,147
Yes, Mr Eaton.

269
00:19:24,405 --> 00:19:26,608
Well, how did it feel
sleeping in your own bed?

270
00:19:26,906 --> 00:19:28,318
You mother wanted to buy
a new mattress...

271
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:30,612
But I said no, that wouldn't be
like coming home.

272
00:19:30,925 --> 00:19:32,961
I slept very well.
Thank you.

273
00:19:32,962 --> 00:19:34,521
Well, I didn't.

274
00:19:34,522 --> 00:19:36,640
It's not as easy
as it used to be.

275
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:41,176
Still, I guess I'm all right
for a man of 57...

276
00:19:41,687 --> 00:19:44,397
Considering the way I worked
my tail off during the war.

277
00:19:45,705 --> 00:19:48,044
Way things work I'm going
to get a chance to rest.

278
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,712
We all are, in our business.

279
00:19:50,851 --> 00:19:53,384
Big contracts canceled months ago...

280
00:19:53,385 --> 00:19:55,909
And now those darn fool workers
are going to strike.

281
00:19:55,927 --> 00:19:57,061
Well let them.

282
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,277
There'll be nothing,
but gas in their kids' bellies...

283
00:19:59,278 --> 00:20:00,818
By the time they come back.

284
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,034
Pay them exactly what you want.
So what do you care?

285
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:09,381
I care because I'm against
anybody going on strike against me.

286
00:20:10,295 --> 00:20:13,197
You'll know what I feel, when
you come into the business with me.

287
00:20:23,023 --> 00:20:26,573
Well, I suppose you're thinking
of taking it easy for a while.

288
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,944
Not exactly.

289
00:20:27,945 --> 00:20:30,409
Maybe traveling a bit, seeing
something of the country...

290
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,213
Before settling down here.

291
00:20:32,466 --> 00:20:35,194
You know, we got to start thinking
of a club in Philadelphia...

292
00:20:35,195 --> 00:20:36,448
For a young fellow like you.

293
00:20:36,472 --> 00:20:38,524
I doubt very much that
I'll be joining a club...

294
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:40,944
But even if I do,
it'll probably be in New York.

295
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,284
New York?

296
00:20:46,818 --> 00:20:48,074
What for?

297
00:20:48,176 --> 00:20:50,963
Because I expect to be spending
some time there.

298
00:20:51,238 --> 00:20:52,436
I thought you were going to travel.

299
00:20:52,437 --> 00:20:55,434
No, you said I was going to travel.
I didn't say it, you said it.

300
00:20:55,962 --> 00:20:57,701
My home base will be in New York.

301
00:20:57,719 --> 00:20:59,243
The hell it will.

302
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:00,663
The hell it won't!

303
00:21:05,736 --> 00:21:08,041
I guess I don't feel
like having any breakfast.

304
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:12,054
Tell them in the kitchen
I'm not staying.

305
00:21:13,117 --> 00:21:14,858
Don't you want to hear
what my plans are?

306
00:21:15,897 --> 00:21:17,322
I'm in no hurry to.

307
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,729
I can see you are not going to do what
I'd hoped you'd do...

308
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:22,576
And you thought it all out without
discussing it it with me.

309
00:21:22,584 --> 00:21:24,176
I'd be glad to discuss it
with you.

310
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:26,100
You don't want to discuss anything...

311
00:21:26,101 --> 00:21:29,024
You want to tell me to go to
the devil and take the mill with me.

312
00:21:29,051 --> 00:21:31,124
That's probably the only reason
you came home...

313
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,775
You've been wanting
to do that all your life.

314
00:21:32,776 --> 00:21:35,658
All my life, all I wanted to do
is to be friends with you.

315
00:21:36,232 --> 00:21:38,646
That's what you want,
to be friend with me.

316
00:21:39,134 --> 00:21:40,070
Listen to me young fellow...

317
00:21:40,072 --> 00:21:42,435
I haven't got a friend for every 10
years of my life.

318
00:21:42,436 --> 00:21:43,875
I was hoping for that, too.

319
00:21:44,228 --> 00:21:45,822
But first, you'll gonna have
to show me...

320
00:21:45,823 --> 00:21:47,743
You're the kind of a man I'd want
to be friends with.

321
00:21:47,744 --> 00:21:50,665
The job at the mill was gonna be yours
because the mill would be yours....

322
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,950
And I hoped the friendship
would come out of that.

323
00:21:52,951 --> 00:21:54,457
Would come out of what?

324
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:57,156
Being your errand boy,
the boss's son, your lackey?

325
00:21:57,157 --> 00:21:59,230
You never asked me
what I wanted to do.

326
00:21:59,231 --> 00:22:00,449
What I wanted to be!

327
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,457
Now I'm supposed to go
into the mill with you, what for?

328
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:03,918
To please you, that's all!

329
00:22:03,951 --> 00:22:05,525
You'd cripple me for life.

330
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,103
You would like that wouldn’t you?
You don't think I can make it on my own.

331
00:22:08,104 --> 00:22:11,116
You're not big enough
to even walk in my shadow...

332
00:22:11,508 --> 00:22:13,189
And you never will be.

333
00:22:33,742 --> 00:22:34,720
Alfred.

334
00:23:03,176 --> 00:23:06,354
So much shouting...
So early in the day...

335
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:09,070
With the servants around, too.

336
00:23:09,217 --> 00:23:12,732
I guess we're not a very dignified,
respectable family, are we mother?

337
00:23:14,582 --> 00:23:15,969
You must give him time.

338
00:23:17,032 --> 00:23:18,741
For what? He'll never change.

339
00:23:20,145 --> 00:23:22,136
He might get used to your ways.

340
00:23:22,605 --> 00:23:24,272
I don't think I have that much time.

341
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:25,749
Neither has he.

342
00:23:25,805 --> 00:23:29,720
There's a lot of sadness
and a lot of sweetness in you, Alfred,

343
00:23:30,498 --> 00:23:33,644
But you can be very cruel
and cold sometimes.

344
00:23:39,365 --> 00:23:41,494
Nice, kind Alfred.

345
00:23:42,565 --> 00:23:44,760
Did I just say something awful?

346
00:23:45,775 --> 00:23:46,931
I'm sorry.

347
00:23:46,957 --> 00:23:48,633
Nothing for you
to be sorry about.

348
00:23:49,535 --> 00:23:50,450
Yes, I did.

349
00:23:51,434 --> 00:23:52,874
What's happened to me?

350
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:54,986
I used to be nice...

351
00:23:55,451 --> 00:23:58,147
And I don't even remember
what made me change.

352
00:23:59,087 --> 00:24:00,617
Don't be hard on yourself.

353
00:24:05,232 --> 00:24:07,372
I know a lot more
than you think I do.

354
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:09,819
You're still my mother.

355
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,233
What do you know?

356
00:24:14,065 --> 00:24:15,384
Everything.

357
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,851
Oh, God.

358
00:24:21,904 --> 00:24:24,181
Put your arms around me, Alfred.

359
00:24:31,093 --> 00:24:33,105
Do you still like me a little?

360
00:24:33,131 --> 00:24:34,394
I love you, Mother.

361
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,893
Even when I'm like this?

362
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,096
You're leaving us,
aren't you, Alfred?

363
00:24:58,271 --> 00:24:59,184
Yes.

364
00:25:00,592 --> 00:25:02,052
Where are you going?

365
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:05,323
I may stay with Lex Porter
in New York for a while.

366
00:25:05,936 --> 00:25:07,566
I suppose you'll see the Thorntons.

367
00:25:08,222 --> 00:25:10,697
Fritz Thornton is throwing a party
for Lex tonight in Southampton.

368
00:25:11,993 --> 00:25:15,726
The Porters and the Thorntons
are like a second family to you...

369
00:25:16,813 --> 00:25:18,666
But just remember, they're not.

370
00:25:20,213 --> 00:25:21,867
Don't get too independent.

371
00:25:25,061 --> 00:25:27,385
Don't cut off
your own flesh and blood.

372
00:25:29,385 --> 00:25:31,103
Anybody can disappoint you,

373
00:25:31,104 --> 00:25:33,006
if you catch them
at the wrong time

374
00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:35,633
and that includes
you, too, Alfred.

375
00:25:37,281 --> 00:25:40,179
I know I'm not what you think
your mother ought to be.

376
00:25:40,601 --> 00:25:42,920
I'm sorry if it embarrasses you...

377
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:46,593
And I'm not going to make
any excuses.

378
00:25:46,594 --> 00:25:48,306
Don't worry.
That's not why I'm leaving.

379
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,103
I could feel it last night...

380
00:25:54,399 --> 00:25:57,243
Your very first look at me
down in the driveway.

381
00:25:59,734 --> 00:26:00,860
What am I?

382
00:26:01,891 --> 00:26:03,357
A hopeless drunkard?

383
00:26:05,267 --> 00:26:07,682
They'd rather have me that
than the other thing...

384
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:09,660
An unfaithful wife.

385
00:26:13,074 --> 00:26:14,633
A pig, he called me.

386
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,518
Well...

387
00:26:18,938 --> 00:26:21,664
The drinking makes a good
cover-up for a lot of things.

388
00:26:24,651 --> 00:26:26,209
Goodbye now, Mother.

389
00:26:26,533 --> 00:26:29,949
"It wouldn't have happened
if she hadn't been a drinker."

390
00:26:31,598 --> 00:26:34,025
"Martha Eaton wouldn't do such things...

391
00:26:35,111 --> 00:26:37,734
If she didn't like gin
and whiskey so much."

392
00:26:44,266 --> 00:26:45,238
Well...

393
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,994
Little do they know.

394
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,704
Little does anybody know.

395
00:27:10,616 --> 00:27:12,107
May I have this dance?

396
00:27:12,133 --> 00:27:13,678
Oh, why, certainly.

397
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,848
Will you pardon
me just a moment?

398
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:22,758
Sure.

399
00:27:24,371 --> 00:27:25,700
Thank you.

400
00:27:28,485 --> 00:27:30,144
Are you looking for me?

401
00:27:31,423 --> 00:27:33,304
I am if your name
is Lex Porter.

402
00:27:33,314 --> 00:27:35,113
Well, my name is Clemmie Shreve...

403
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,839
But I'll change it
if you'll stop looking further.

404
00:27:38,989 --> 00:27:40,860
Just how far am I allowed to look?

405
00:27:44,183 --> 00:27:45,517
You're fresh.

406
00:27:46,445 --> 00:27:49,107
I like you. Sam?

407
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:50,237
No, Alfred.

408
00:27:50,972 --> 00:27:53,095
Are you going to make
a pass at me, Alfred?

409
00:27:53,408 --> 00:27:55,049
You believe
in long courtships, don't you?

410
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,307
Who's got time?
I'm crowding 19.

411
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:59,203
What, years or guys?

412
00:28:00,117 --> 00:28:01,683
Nasty.

413
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:06,310
Come on. Let's dance
and crowd each other.

414
00:28:06,765 --> 00:28:09,120
Look I got a wooden leg,
I better go fill first.

415
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:11,249
Oh, you mean it's all over between us?

416
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,793
Well,
these things don't last forever.

417
00:28:50,694 --> 00:28:53,109
Waiter, where I can find Mr Porter.

418
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,067
He went into the den
a few minutes ago, sir.

419
00:29:03,096 --> 00:29:04,290
Excuse me.

420
00:29:04,824 --> 00:29:06,307
Hey, wait a minute.

421
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,052
Alfred, when did you get here?

422
00:29:11,053 --> 00:29:12,264
Couple of minutes ago.

423
00:29:12,265 --> 00:29:14,144
Come in, come in!
Join us!

424
00:29:14,145 --> 00:29:15,476
Alfred Eaton...

425
00:29:15,502 --> 00:29:17,001
Sage Rimmington.

426
00:29:20,357 --> 00:29:21,348
Sorry.

427
00:29:21,906 --> 00:29:22,809
So am I.

428
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:25,081
Sage, this is the rover boy,
that I went through...

429
00:29:25,082 --> 00:29:26,686
Princeton and the Navy with...

430
00:29:26,687 --> 00:29:29,042
And, who knows what lies ahead?

431
00:29:30,037 --> 00:29:32,312
Darling, if you'll excuse me...

432
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:35,350
I think I'll put on
something more comfortable.

433
00:29:36,684 --> 00:29:38,197
Like my husband.

434
00:29:40,051 --> 00:29:41,821
Bye, sweetie.

435
00:29:45,982 --> 00:29:47,074
I like that.

436
00:29:47,075 --> 00:29:48,970
Oh, she's very inventive.

437
00:29:50,078 --> 00:29:52,308
- How was it, boy?
- How was what?

438
00:29:52,503 --> 00:29:53,484
Getting home.

439
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:54,996
Great.

440
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:57,639
Yeah, me, too.

441
00:29:58,751 --> 00:30:00,277
I snapped out of it, though.

442
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:04,743
Good booze, bad women.
It never fails to work.

443
00:30:05,841 --> 00:30:07,482
How did things go
in the money department?

444
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,439
Our project.
Did you raise the dough?

445
00:30:13,481 --> 00:30:14,950
Oh, your old man, uh?

446
00:30:19,377 --> 00:30:21,625
Well, I'll have another little talk
with Uncle Fritz.

447
00:30:21,828 --> 00:30:24,946
I'll just charm him
into putting up the whole 500,000.

448
00:30:24,947 --> 00:30:26,460
I don't want that.

449
00:30:26,945 --> 00:30:29,155
I know you don't, sport,
but have we got any choice?

450
00:30:30,692 --> 00:30:32,489
I don't mean to sound ungrateful,

451
00:30:32,725 --> 00:30:34,757
But we'll just have to wait
till I can swing my own end.

452
00:30:34,991 --> 00:30:37,373
I'm not going into any
business venture...

453
00:30:37,501 --> 00:30:39,890
Where I carry as much weight
as a poor relative.

454
00:30:41,154 --> 00:30:43,907
Well, I understand pal.
It just doesn't mean that much to me.

455
00:30:44,226 --> 00:30:45,579
It does to me.

456
00:30:47,285 --> 00:30:49,553
Boy, you did have a rough time
at home, didn't you?

457
00:30:50,925 --> 00:30:53,088
You know, the first thing we got to do
is get you out of there.

458
00:30:53,523 --> 00:30:55,041
I've already taken
care of that.

459
00:30:55,194 --> 00:30:56,096
Really?

460
00:30:57,133 --> 00:30:58,299
What are your plans?

461
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:00,323
I don't know.

462
00:31:00,565 --> 00:31:01,676
I was sort of...

463
00:31:02,248 --> 00:31:03,883
Thinking about that
bachelor apartment...

464
00:31:03,886 --> 00:31:05,686
You were going to set up
in Gramercy Park.

465
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,593
Hey, now you're talking.

466
00:31:11,387 --> 00:31:12,925
Play it by ear for a while.

467
00:31:13,798 --> 00:31:16,111
Well, you can use your ear.
I got better ideas.

468
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:18,589
C'mon, let's start right now.

469
00:31:25,765 --> 00:31:27,338
Now, would you look at this?

470
00:31:27,712 --> 00:31:30,007
200 beautiful Long Island virgins.

471
00:31:30,046 --> 00:31:32,811
Markel's dance music,
buckets of champagne...

472
00:31:32,812 --> 00:31:36,122
And I'm the guest of honor.
Now, how can I lose?

473
00:31:37,305 --> 00:31:38,784
Unless I start getting drunk...

474
00:31:38,785 --> 00:31:40,479
And taking those little girls
upstairs.

475
00:31:40,675 --> 00:31:42,315
I met something called Clemmie.

476
00:31:42,341 --> 00:31:44,039
Oh, Clemmie Shreve.

477
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,031
Now, I'm saving that
for a rainy night.

478
00:31:47,571 --> 00:31:49,590
Uh, there he is, Uncle Fritz.

479
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,158
Look who's here.

480
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:03,716
- Alfred, I'm so glad to see you.
- Mr Thornton, how are you?

481
00:32:03,717 --> 00:32:06,272
This party wouldn't be complete
without you, young man.

482
00:32:06,344 --> 00:32:07,902
Champagne for three.

483
00:32:07,903 --> 00:32:09,745
Have they been treating
you properly here?

484
00:32:09,771 --> 00:32:11,087
No complaints.

485
00:32:11,128 --> 00:32:14,120
Well, I hope you're going to stay
with us for a good long visit.

486
00:32:14,757 --> 00:32:16,262
I may take you up on that.

487
00:32:16,294 --> 00:32:18,558
Well, I...
I hoped for this moment.

488
00:32:18,905 --> 00:32:20,789
The three of us together like this...

489
00:32:21,209 --> 00:32:22,821
As I hoped for victory.

490
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:24,292
God bless you.

491
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,779
Thought I might as
well start at the top.

492
00:33:19,805 --> 00:33:20,794
Did you?

493
00:33:20,795 --> 00:33:22,387
Pretty close to it.

494
00:33:22,703 --> 00:33:25,274
Thanks for the compliment.
And who are you?

495
00:33:25,275 --> 00:33:27,299
Alfred Eaton, but that wouldn't
mean anything to you.

496
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,292
What's your name?

497
00:33:28,301 --> 00:33:29,731
Mary St. John.

498
00:33:30,361 --> 00:33:31,748
A nice, respectable name.

499
00:33:32,236 --> 00:33:33,825
Well, of course
it's respectable.

500
00:33:33,851 --> 00:33:35,444
That's a silly thing to say.

501
00:33:35,445 --> 00:33:37,684
Am I the first
to call it respectable?

502
00:33:37,685 --> 00:33:40,163
You're the first
who ever raised the question.

503
00:33:40,164 --> 00:33:43,071
In that case I'm glad I called it
respectable instead of the opposite.

504
00:33:43,198 --> 00:33:46,437
If you're trying to annoy me, Mr Eaton,
you're succeeding.

505
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:49,173
No, my manners are just a little rusty.

506
00:33:49,174 --> 00:33:51,557
You're the first girl I've danced
with for a long time.

507
00:33:51,661 --> 00:33:54,125
Why didn't you bestow that
honor on someone inside...

508
00:33:54,126 --> 00:33:55,949
Instead of here on the terrace?

509
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:57,652
Oh, I don't know, I...

510
00:33:58,026 --> 00:33:59,785
Rather like the view
from the terrace.

511
00:33:59,786 --> 00:34:02,250
And then I saw you
and I liked the view even more.

512
00:34:03,324 --> 00:34:04,969
You touch me deeply.

513
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,757
But not in the right places?

514
00:34:18,582 --> 00:34:20,493
Well,
that was reasonably disagreeable.

515
00:34:20,494 --> 00:34:22,048
Yes, and it was so easy.

516
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:23,828
Would you like to go upstairs
and cry or something?

517
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:26,525
No, but I wouldn't mind,
if you faded away into the sunset.

518
00:34:28,418 --> 00:34:30,333
Here comes the bird dog,
to retrieve you.

519
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:31,708
What's his name?

520
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:34,615
- Jim Roper.
- Oh, grim Jim Roper?

521
00:34:34,682 --> 00:34:36,957
No. Dr Roper.
He's a psychiatrist.

522
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:39,564
Oh, sorry.
I hope you get well very soon.

523
00:34:42,033 --> 00:34:43,864
Good night, Mr Eaton.

524
00:34:44,145 --> 00:34:45,372
Good night, Miss St. John.

525
00:34:45,626 --> 00:34:47,062
All yours, Doctor.

526
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,375
I know that.

527
00:35:01,685 --> 00:35:03,431
Oh, I don't know about these girls.

528
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,236
I heard they were like minks
during the war.

529
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,255
How are you doing?

530
00:35:08,575 --> 00:35:10,614
You tell me.
Who's Mary St. John?

531
00:35:13,475 --> 00:35:16,724
Her old man's with the DuPont
Corporation down in Wilmington.

532
00:35:16,725 --> 00:35:19,724
Fancy pedigree.
Papers on both sides.

533
00:35:19,725 --> 00:35:21,609
Hey, waiter.
You can forget about her.

534
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:22,673
Why?

535
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,906
- You want one?
- No.

536
00:35:26,957 --> 00:35:29,380
She's secretly engaged
to the guy she's with.

537
00:35:29,816 --> 00:35:31,451
The doctor, Jim Roper.

538
00:35:32,444 --> 00:35:34,551
I really don't think
he's rich enough for her...

539
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:37,530
But if it isn't him it'll be
somebody else who is.

540
00:35:38,108 --> 00:35:40,064
If you're not thinking
about marrying her...

541
00:35:40,065 --> 00:35:41,925
You can forget about
anything else.

542
00:35:41,926 --> 00:35:43,845
She's really saving it.

543
00:35:44,264 --> 00:35:45,708
Do you want to make a little bet?

544
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:48,066
Oh, wake up, sport.

545
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,035
You haven't got
the necessary qualifications.

546
00:35:50,036 --> 00:35:52,101
Well, there are all kinds
of qualifications.

547
00:36:08,245 --> 00:36:11,399
And straight ahead you'll notice
the famous Whitney estate.

548
00:36:12,544 --> 00:36:14,165
Oh, and there to the right...

549
00:36:14,167 --> 00:36:17,159
Is the estate of James
Duncan MacHardie.

550
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:20,497
You notice the smoke
rising from the chimney?

551
00:36:20,735 --> 00:36:24,135
In all probability
Mr MacHardie is burning money.

552
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,495
Stop hiding behind the glasses.

553
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:29,553
I'm not hiding.

554
00:36:29,801 --> 00:36:32,153
You always manage to put
something between us...

555
00:36:32,154 --> 00:36:34,846
Like Jim Roper, or your friend
Sage Rimmington...

556
00:36:34,847 --> 00:36:36,760
Or the net of a tennis court.

557
00:36:41,665 --> 00:36:43,021
What are you afraid of?

558
00:36:43,515 --> 00:36:46,230
- Let's go back to shore shall we?
- See what I mean?

559
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,427
You know, I don't even know
why you bother talking to me...

560
00:36:50,428 --> 00:36:53,898
Because every time you do, you get
sarcastic and we end up in a fight.

561
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:57,026
Now, if you don't approve of me,
why don't you just leave me alone...

562
00:36:57,027 --> 00:36:59,211
I'm sure I won't perish
from unhappiness.

563
00:37:01,493 --> 00:37:03,049
This is the first time
we've been alone.

564
00:37:06,644 --> 00:37:07,954
How long are you going to be here?

565
00:37:08,929 --> 00:37:10,313
A month or so.

566
00:37:10,601 --> 00:37:12,162
Then back to Wilmington?

567
00:37:16,279 --> 00:37:18,876
I used to live very close to there,
Port Johnson, Pennsylvania.

568
00:37:21,444 --> 00:37:24,277
I thought you lived in New York,
in Gramercy Park...

569
00:37:24,278 --> 00:37:28,191
With Lex and all the stray girls
you could lay your hands on

570
00:37:28,524 --> 00:37:30,082
Or so they tell me.

571
00:37:48,905 --> 00:37:50,271
I think we'd better go back.

572
00:37:50,272 --> 00:37:52,724
- You don't mean that.
- Yes, I do mean that.

573
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:56,760
I knew you were going to kiss me today,
but I didn't know I'd kiss you back...

574
00:37:56,762 --> 00:38:00,327
And it isn't going to happen again,
so don't try to get me up alone somewhere.

575
00:38:00,755 --> 00:38:03,064
- You'd like that.
- Stop it.

576
00:38:03,065 --> 00:38:06,624
- Why?
- 'Cause I'm engaged to Jim Roper.

577
00:38:07,212 --> 00:38:10,506
- You going to marry him?
- Well, I'm engaged to him.

578
00:38:11,778 --> 00:38:13,780
But you didn't say
you were going to marry him.

579
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,306
Look, are you going to row me back to shore
or am I going to have to swim back?

580
00:38:21,593 --> 00:38:23,145
Swim.

581
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,927
Hello, Alfred.

582
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:27,566
Who is it, Mary?

583
00:39:28,172 --> 00:39:29,780
It's just a friend, Mother.

584
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,189
Well, who is it, Mary?

585
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,469
I think you better come in.

586
00:39:44,225 --> 00:39:47,180
Mother, this is Alfred Eaton.
My mother.

587
00:39:47,181 --> 00:39:48,936
- How do you do?
- How do you do, Mr Eaton.

588
00:39:48,937 --> 00:39:51,278
And my father.
Daddy, Alfred Eaton.

589
00:39:51,279 --> 00:39:52,701
Pleased to meet you, sir.

590
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:55,857
I don't believe
we've seen you before.

591
00:39:55,858 --> 00:39:57,137
Are you from these parts?

592
00:39:57,249 --> 00:39:59,852
Not very far from here, sir.
Port Johnson, Pennsylvania.

593
00:40:00,096 --> 00:40:01,553
Oh, yes. The steel mill.

594
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,229
So, you're that Eaton.

595
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:05,843
What do you think of the strike?

596
00:40:06,178 --> 00:40:08,277
I'm not in the mill, sir,
but my father doesn't like it.

597
00:40:08,278 --> 00:40:09,836
Yeah, I shouldn't think he would.

598
00:40:10,917 --> 00:40:14,280
Well Mr. Eaton, what brings you to
Wilmington at this awkward hour?

599
00:40:14,864 --> 00:40:17,245
I was just duck hunting
on my way to New York...

600
00:40:17,246 --> 00:40:18,959
I thought I'd stop and say hello to Mary.

601
00:40:19,356 --> 00:40:20,391
How was the shooting?

602
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,654
I got a few tail feathers.

603
00:40:22,655 --> 00:40:23,870
How is Jim?

604
00:40:25,272 --> 00:40:26,509
- Jim?
- Yes.

605
00:40:27,405 --> 00:40:28,370
You mean Jim Roper?

606
00:40:28,371 --> 00:40:31,030
Yes. I assume you're close
friends, aren't you?

607
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,213
Not exactly.

608
00:40:32,214 --> 00:40:33,660
Oh, well, now...

609
00:40:34,049 --> 00:40:35,216
Not a friend of Jim's.

610
00:40:35,765 --> 00:40:37,528
Isn't that a bit strange?

611
00:40:37,552 --> 00:40:40,379
No, Mother, Jim and I met Alfred
at the same time.

612
00:40:41,279 --> 00:40:43,629
Then he's really a friend of yours,
more than Jim's.

613
00:40:44,049 --> 00:40:45,145
That's right.

614
00:40:45,565 --> 00:40:46,783
Tell me, Mr Eaton...

615
00:40:47,267 --> 00:40:49,826
You're not in the mill.
What do you do?

616
00:40:50,105 --> 00:40:52,477
I mean, besides duck hunting
in the middle of the week.

617
00:40:53,324 --> 00:40:55,360
Actually, I've got some very
exciting business plans...

618
00:40:55,361 --> 00:40:57,222
I'm not allowed to
disclose them right now.

619
00:40:57,809 --> 00:40:58,737
I see.

620
00:41:02,612 --> 00:41:03,683
Well...

621
00:41:04,174 --> 00:41:05,584
I guess I better be going.

622
00:41:05,585 --> 00:41:06,924
My husband will see you to the door.

623
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:08,703
No, mother, I will.

624
00:41:10,945 --> 00:41:13,286
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

625
00:41:13,411 --> 00:41:15,900
- Good night, Mrs St. John.
- Goodbye, Mr Eaton.

626
00:41:29,657 --> 00:41:31,243
Your mother and father...

627
00:41:32,316 --> 00:41:33,552
Are sort of distant.

628
00:41:36,352 --> 00:41:37,978
Now, what do you mean by that?

629
00:41:40,325 --> 00:41:41,807
You know what I mean.

630
00:42:05,805 --> 00:42:08,478
You never did believe
I was going to marry Jim, did you?

631
00:42:10,852 --> 00:42:13,196
I wrote him a letter
and I broke up with him.

632
00:42:13,305 --> 00:42:14,912
Why didn't you tell me?

633
00:42:16,565 --> 00:42:18,368
I don't know.
I didn't tell anybody.

634
00:42:20,563 --> 00:42:22,022
Alfred?

635
00:42:25,451 --> 00:42:27,256
Are you going to do something...

636
00:42:28,096 --> 00:42:29,453
And be somebody?

637
00:42:29,772 --> 00:42:30,720
For you?

638
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:32,648
Yes.

639
00:42:32,948 --> 00:42:33,937
Settle down?

640
00:42:35,087 --> 00:42:36,096
Yes.

641
00:42:36,485 --> 00:42:37,637
With you?

642
00:42:46,385 --> 00:42:47,726
Do you love me?

643
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,101
Oh, I want you.

644
00:42:51,586 --> 00:42:53,541
More than anything
in the whole world.

645
00:42:56,309 --> 00:42:57,521
Mary?

646
00:42:59,133 --> 00:43:02,327
You're never going to want anybody
else as long as you live.

647
00:43:07,644 --> 00:43:09,065
You better go in now.

648
00:43:40,845 --> 00:43:42,396
I should think he'd know better.

649
00:43:43,416 --> 00:43:45,827
- He wanted to see me.
- And you should, too.

650
00:43:45,828 --> 00:43:47,819
I happen to like Alfred, Mother.

651
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,397
The Eatons are nothing and nobody.

652
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:52,074
The mother is a drunkard.

653
00:43:52,139 --> 00:43:54,334
The father is a noisy nouveau riche
war profiteer.

654
00:43:54,492 --> 00:43:56,112
Now how do you
happen to know that?

655
00:43:56,138 --> 00:43:57,936
You haven't met
either one of them.

656
00:43:57,945 --> 00:43:59,923
I have my sources of information.

657
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,338
And if he were a gentleman, he'd stay
away from you before people start talking.

658
00:44:03,821 --> 00:44:06,979
I don't want him, your father doesn't
want him. That's all there is to it.

659
00:44:07,399 --> 00:44:09,100
That isn't all there is to it.

660
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:11,517
I've broken my
engagement to Jim.

661
00:44:12,135 --> 00:44:13,199
I can't believe it.

662
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:14,330
Mary...

663
00:44:14,941 --> 00:44:16,610
I forbid you to see this man again.

664
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:20,286
I don't like that word forbid, father.
It makes me want to disobey you.

665
00:44:20,341 --> 00:44:23,217
In that case,
I shall have a talk with Mr Eaton.

666
00:44:24,585 --> 00:44:26,301
Alfred or his father?

667
00:44:26,827 --> 00:44:29,787
I meant the young man...
But you've given me an idea.

668
00:44:30,181 --> 00:44:32,560
Don't do that, father!
It's my life!

669
00:44:39,226 --> 00:44:42,524
I don't have to take
that kind of talk...

670
00:44:43,293 --> 00:44:46,510
From Eugene St. John
or any of that DuPont crowd!

671
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:48,453
So you didn't.
You hung up on him.

672
00:44:48,479 --> 00:44:50,143
If you'd stayed
where you belong...

673
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:52,012
Maybe I don't like
where I belong.

674
00:44:53,185 --> 00:44:55,768
That's what is souring
your insides, isn't it?

675
00:44:55,769 --> 00:44:58,589
That my blood and your mother's
is running through your veins.

676
00:44:58,787 --> 00:45:01,444
That's why you want to get mixed up
with a family who doesn't even want you.

677
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:03,262
I'm not interested
in her family!

678
00:45:03,263 --> 00:45:04,676
Well, let me tell you something...

679
00:45:04,677 --> 00:45:06,524
That you can't buy respectability...

680
00:45:06,525 --> 00:45:08,386
By slipping a wedding ring on it.

681
00:45:08,448 --> 00:45:11,936
Sometimes you end up with just what
you're trying to run away from.

682
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:13,963
And remember, I am
the one who told you.

683
00:45:14,687 --> 00:45:16,242
If you're through with me,
I'd better get going.

684
00:45:16,243 --> 00:45:18,484
Where, back to that apartment
your friend Porter...

685
00:45:18,485 --> 00:45:20,827
And all those questionable
goings-on I hear about?

686
00:45:20,828 --> 00:45:23,884
You haven't done an honest day's
work since you came from the Navy!

687
00:45:23,885 --> 00:45:27,639
For your information father, I'm going into
business with Lex Porter.

688
00:45:30,197 --> 00:45:31,687
Business?

689
00:45:34,344 --> 00:45:36,215
What kind of business?

690
00:45:36,217 --> 00:45:38,513
Aircraft, private planes.

691
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:40,204
Airplanes.

692
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:42,993
That's right. We're going to design,
them, build them and sell them.

693
00:45:43,121 --> 00:45:45,002
What are you going
to use for money?

694
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,339
It's already been taken care of.

695
00:45:49,009 --> 00:45:51,276
Your friend Lex's family financing you?

696
00:45:51,324 --> 00:45:52,316
That's right.

697
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:55,139
- 100%?
- Yes, 100%.

698
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,690
That's one way of putting
your head in a noose.

699
00:45:57,691 --> 00:46:00,977
I was going to ask you for my share,
but I changed my mind.

700
00:46:02,285 --> 00:46:04,274
How much were you
going to ask me to give you?

701
00:46:04,275 --> 00:46:06,584
Not give, lend.
What difference does it make?

702
00:46:06,744 --> 00:46:09,099
Well, here's what I think
of your airplane business.

703
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,407
You can put me down for 500 dollars.

704
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:15,804
Well, that's exactly 500 dollars
more than I expected...

705
00:46:15,805 --> 00:46:17,476
If I had asked you for it.

706
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:19,124
Wait a minute!

707
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:20,482
It's too late, I've
already signed the papers.

708
00:46:20,483 --> 00:46:21,882
It's something else.

709
00:46:30,661 --> 00:46:32,601
There's something
I have to know.

710
00:46:34,822 --> 00:46:36,416
I've been wanting to ask you.

711
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,015
Come to the office.

712
00:46:46,402 --> 00:46:48,055
I don't know how to start this.

713
00:46:49,497 --> 00:46:51,463
I mean, where's the beginning?

714
00:46:55,256 --> 00:46:58,293
Did you ever hear
of a man named Frolick?

715
00:47:00,546 --> 00:47:02,696
- Did you?
- Yes.

716
00:47:03,104 --> 00:47:04,611
In what connection?

717
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,600
I'd rather you put the question
some other way.

718
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:09,577
All right.

719
00:47:10,588 --> 00:47:13,121
- Did you ever meet this man?
- I saw him once.

720
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:17,030
- Did you beat him up?
- Yes, I did.

721
00:47:18,746 --> 00:47:19,969
Thank God.

722
00:47:21,699 --> 00:47:23,361
Thank God it was you.

723
00:47:27,712 --> 00:47:30,648
Maybe you're a lot of things
I never gave you credit for...

724
00:47:32,233 --> 00:47:35,360
But a man my age
can't change so quickly.

725
00:47:37,959 --> 00:47:40,464
I can admit I've been wrong
all these years...

726
00:47:40,465 --> 00:47:42,590
But that wouldn't
make anything right.

727
00:47:44,205 --> 00:47:46,347
It won't take away
what I felt about you...

728
00:47:46,551 --> 00:47:49,914
What I still feel, regardless
of what I know in my brain.

729
00:47:51,053 --> 00:47:53,283
Some time
when you have children, you'll know.

730
00:47:54,918 --> 00:47:57,088
One of them is in here.

731
00:47:59,035 --> 00:48:01,243
He shines. His voice is music.

732
00:48:02,763 --> 00:48:05,820
You love him as though
he never lived in his mother's body.

733
00:48:07,503 --> 00:48:10,791
That's the way Billy was to me...
Long before he died.

734
00:48:10,995 --> 00:48:12,146
And when he died...

735
00:48:13,399 --> 00:48:15,910
There was nobody
who understood what happened to me.

736
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:17,517
You were living...

737
00:48:17,938 --> 00:48:19,374
You were alive...

738
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:22,551
A deliberate thing God did to me.

739
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:25,543
I didn't want another son
or anyone in my life.

740
00:48:25,607 --> 00:48:28,288
Not you, not even your mother.
Just Billy.

741
00:48:31,751 --> 00:48:33,952
That's why your mother took Frolick,

742
00:48:36,674 --> 00:48:38,443
Not because she's immoral...

743
00:48:39,162 --> 00:48:42,072
Because I didn't even tell her
I didn't love her anymore.

744
00:48:42,929 --> 00:48:44,965
She had to find that out for herself.

745
00:48:45,447 --> 00:48:47,546
I guess she knew it before I did.

746
00:48:48,144 --> 00:48:50,260
And yet, even knowing,

747
00:48:52,063 --> 00:48:54,040
How badly it turned out
for everybody...

748
00:48:54,382 --> 00:48:55,779
Including myself...

749
00:48:59,056 --> 00:49:01,029
I would do the same thing over again.

750
00:49:03,515 --> 00:49:06,534
It was so wonderful
loving Billy that much.

751
00:49:09,825 --> 00:49:11,555
Always in your thoughts.

752
00:49:13,221 --> 00:49:15,495
I can feel his arms
around my neck this minute.

753
00:49:17,385 --> 00:49:18,587
Don't go.

754
00:49:20,429 --> 00:49:21,576
Don't go?

755
00:49:22,154 --> 00:49:23,637
What do you think I am?

756
00:49:25,677 --> 00:49:28,828
Alfred, I didn't mean it!
Alfred, my son...

757
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:41,880
Alfred?

758
00:49:48,625 --> 00:49:50,181
- Hello, Mary.
- Get in.

759
00:49:50,938 --> 00:49:52,026
Good evening.

760
00:49:58,399 --> 00:49:59,787
Good evening.

761
00:50:03,831 --> 00:50:05,093
How's your father?

762
00:50:05,771 --> 00:50:06,993
It's hard to tell.

763
00:50:07,509 --> 00:50:10,009
He's always the same man, sick or well.

764
00:50:10,188 --> 00:50:11,116
Yes.

765
00:50:11,791 --> 00:50:14,516
Old men may seem unchangeable
to you, Alfred...

766
00:50:14,915 --> 00:50:17,033
But life itself now,
there's a different thing.

767
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:18,545
Consider this.

768
00:50:18,987 --> 00:50:22,786
A week ago, I was firmly opposed
to any thought of you two marrying.

769
00:50:23,178 --> 00:50:26,399
Tonight, I'm not only reconciled
to it I'm secretly in favor of it.

770
00:50:27,584 --> 00:50:30,656
Yes. Life's full
of unpredictable ironies.

771
00:50:31,351 --> 00:50:34,184
Now, you wouldn't have thought
it was going to be your own father...

772
00:50:34,185 --> 00:50:36,578
Who would be responsible
for this change in my attitude?

773
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,292
My father? How?

774
00:50:38,754 --> 00:50:40,904
By having this unfortunate
heart attack...

775
00:50:41,267 --> 00:50:43,263
Which automatically
transforms your life.

776
00:50:44,025 --> 00:50:47,002
You suddenly change from
irresponsible young man...

777
00:50:47,003 --> 00:50:50,140
To the active head of a family
and Eaton Iron and Steel.

778
00:50:51,134 --> 00:50:53,660
And this removes the lot of
the objections we had to you...

779
00:50:53,661 --> 00:50:55,176
As a prospective son-in-law.

780
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:58,525
I know you haven't had experience
running a mill, Alfred, but...

781
00:50:58,823 --> 00:51:01,356
But you can be sure I'll help you
in any way I can.

782
00:51:03,065 --> 00:51:06,694
Thank you very much, Mr Saint John, but
I haven't got the slightest intention...

783
00:51:06,695 --> 00:51:08,128
Of running my father's mill.

784
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:10,729
I plan to be active head
of my own family...

785
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:12,662
Which means Mary and me.

786
00:51:13,869 --> 00:51:16,037
Good night, sir.
Good night, Mary.

787
00:51:22,757 --> 00:51:24,153
Do you give up?

788
00:51:25,917 --> 00:51:27,987
Yes, I give up.

789
00:51:38,802 --> 00:51:40,675
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

790
00:51:40,748 --> 00:51:42,658
Eugene, lovely day for a wedding.

791
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:57,527
Hello, Mary.

792
00:51:57,834 --> 00:51:59,847
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

793
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,944
- Don't go, Sage.
- I think I'd better.

794
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:09,429
I read all your letters.
I know exactly how you feel.

795
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:14,117
Does he know you the way I do?

796
00:52:16,224 --> 00:52:18,551
Does he know that wild
and wonderful nature of yours?

797
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,336
I think you'd better leave.

798
00:52:22,112 --> 00:52:23,310
It won't work.

799
00:52:23,702 --> 00:52:24,907
Please go.

800
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:27,700
You don't have to marry him
to get what you want of him.

801
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,579
Good luck, Mary.

802
00:53:03,528 --> 00:53:04,783
Yeah?

803
00:53:05,471 --> 00:53:07,939
Hi. What's the matter
you change your mind?

804
00:53:08,866 --> 00:53:10,350
Alfred, do you love me?

805
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:13,105
Do I love you?
Of course I love you.

806
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:14,778
Is that why you called?

807
00:53:16,518 --> 00:53:17,550
All right.

808
00:53:18,137 --> 00:53:21,575
I love you. I love you. I love you.

809
00:53:22,336 --> 00:53:24,189
And incidentally
we have a date tonight.

810
00:53:25,655 --> 00:53:27,660
Careful, now.
Somebody might be listening.

811
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:30,865
Yeah.

812
00:53:31,982 --> 00:53:33,190
Goodbye.

813
00:53:38,994 --> 00:53:41,303
Hi. Come on in.
I've got a great idea.

814
00:53:43,363 --> 00:53:45,594
Porter-Eaton Flying Machine Company.

815
00:53:47,811 --> 00:53:49,537
Tailspins, Incorporated.

816
00:53:50,862 --> 00:53:52,397
Bottoms Up Corporation?

817
00:53:54,361 --> 00:53:56,239
If your Uncle Fritz ever heard me
talking like this...

818
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,772
He'd probably take back the money.

819
00:53:59,851 --> 00:54:01,379
Alfred, you trust me, don't you?

820
00:54:01,615 --> 00:54:03,765
Why, sure, I do. You're my best man.

821
00:54:04,986 --> 00:54:06,576
I have to tell you something, then.

822
00:54:09,138 --> 00:54:10,537
I can't.

823
00:54:12,503 --> 00:54:14,449
Your mother
just phoned from the hospital.

824
00:54:16,412 --> 00:54:19,048
She told me not to say anything
to anybody, especially to you.

825
00:54:20,221 --> 00:54:21,346
What is it?

826
00:54:23,345 --> 00:54:25,198
Your father died a few minutes ago.

827
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,468
I'm sorry.

828
00:54:39,852 --> 00:54:41,374
Shall I tell them to
call off the wedding?

829
00:54:41,432 --> 00:54:42,367
No.

830
00:54:58,677 --> 00:55:00,297
Well, I guess he hated me so much...

831
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,001
He couldn't even...

832
00:55:08,509 --> 00:55:10,611
Stand to be alive
on the day I got married.

833
00:55:31,545 --> 00:55:33,615
Oh, I like this little baby.

834
00:55:34,049 --> 00:55:35,814
She's like my ideal woman...

835
00:55:36,234 --> 00:55:37,383
Handles easily...

836
00:55:37,384 --> 00:55:39,202
Levels off without too much work.

837
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:41,819
Hey, buddy, you're not with me.

838
00:55:42,209 --> 00:55:43,652
Oh, I'm with you.

839
00:55:44,558 --> 00:55:46,037
Come on, what is it?

840
00:55:46,324 --> 00:55:47,332
Alright.

841
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:50,152
I saw those new two cradled engines
in the hangar today.

842
00:55:50,865 --> 00:55:52,821
The Navy ordered
100 from Continental.

843
00:55:52,822 --> 00:55:54,179
We heard about it and got two.

844
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:55,021
Who's we?

845
00:55:55,022 --> 00:55:57,669
- Von Elm and myself.
- Why wasn't I consulted?

846
00:55:57,670 --> 00:56:00,187
- We need engines, don't we?
- Yeah, we need engines.

847
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,047
I just don't like the idea you're
going over my head again.

848
00:56:03,048 --> 00:56:04,144
How do you like it?

849
00:56:04,145 --> 00:56:06,338
We're about to buzz
your happy little home...

850
00:56:06,339 --> 00:56:07,977
And your happy little wife.

851
00:56:08,209 --> 00:56:13,182
I think the least you can do out of the occasion
is put a smile, on that sour pan of yours.

852
00:56:58,625 --> 00:57:01,719
What did you marry,
a man or a mosquito?

853
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,389
Very much a man, Sage.

854
00:57:03,979 --> 00:57:06,824
A delicious man and all man
from the top of his head...

855
00:57:06,825 --> 00:57:08,228
To the tip of his toes.

856
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:09,334
Ah-ah!

857
00:57:09,524 --> 00:57:11,389
What was that "ah-ah" for?

858
00:57:11,901 --> 00:57:13,565
You've been married over a year, honey.

859
00:57:13,566 --> 00:57:16,444
If you're about to say,
"Why no children?" don't.

860
00:57:16,445 --> 00:57:18,035
That's my doing, not his.

861
00:57:18,061 --> 00:57:20,016
Sweety, I ain't talking
about children...

862
00:57:20,017 --> 00:57:22,220
I hate the little stinkers,
and you know it.

863
00:57:22,221 --> 00:57:24,924
You absolutely shock me, Sage.

864
00:57:24,988 --> 00:57:26,004
Why?

865
00:57:26,377 --> 00:57:29,725
Because I say what you...
Secretly feel?

866
00:57:29,726 --> 00:57:30,992
Oh, stop it.

867
00:57:31,986 --> 00:57:33,356
It's unfair, you know...

868
00:57:33,639 --> 00:57:35,766
The way I tell you everything
about Steve and me...

869
00:57:36,669 --> 00:57:38,506
What it's like when
we're alone together...

870
00:57:39,144 --> 00:57:41,097
And you not only
don't let me in on a thing...

871
00:57:41,098 --> 00:57:44,178
That goes on between you
and that gorgeous fellow of yours...

872
00:57:44,624 --> 00:57:47,135
But you even try to pull
the wool over my eyes.

873
00:57:49,025 --> 00:57:52,528
The trouble with you Sage is you're
nothing but a frustrated Peeping Tom.

874
00:57:52,529 --> 00:57:54,569
Oh, this is the wrong gender, darling.

875
00:57:55,499 --> 00:57:56,971
Come on now, woman-to-woman...

876
00:57:57,208 --> 00:57:58,422
What's he like?

877
00:58:01,531 --> 00:58:02,619
He's fine.

878
00:58:03,265 --> 00:58:06,306
But you do wish he'd come home
into your waiting arms of yours...

879
00:58:06,307 --> 00:58:07,804
A little more often, huh?

880
00:58:07,805 --> 00:58:11,384
Precisely what can a group
of red-blooded American males...

881
00:58:11,385 --> 00:58:14,194
Do to an airplane propeller
until 4:oo in the morning?

882
00:58:15,725 --> 00:58:17,716
Well, I don't think I'd want a man...

883
00:58:17,717 --> 00:58:19,756
Who wasn't interested
in being successful.

884
00:58:19,974 --> 00:58:21,829
Oh, I'm curious.

885
00:58:22,538 --> 00:58:25,231
What does success look like
when you turn out the lights?

886
00:58:25,525 --> 00:58:28,179
Oh, you're impossible, Sage,
you know that?

887
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:31,007
Well, I say if work is a man's mistress...

888
00:58:31,013 --> 00:58:32,834
Then there's only one answer
for the wife...

889
00:58:33,234 --> 00:58:34,227
Another man.

890
00:58:35,226 --> 00:58:36,780
And how is Jim Roper these days?

891
00:58:38,048 --> 00:58:39,246
Ever hear from him?

892
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,255
Of course not.

893
00:58:40,707 --> 00:58:42,114
Now, don't let faint heart...

894
00:58:42,115 --> 00:58:44,345
Spoil life's golden
opportunities, darling.

895
00:58:44,549 --> 00:58:48,542
You know, I don't want to seem like a bore,
Sage, but I'm really not interested in this.

896
00:58:50,049 --> 00:58:51,989
- What gives?
- I don't know.

897
00:58:52,249 --> 00:58:54,046
- Pull it up.
- I'm trying.

898
00:59:26,357 --> 00:59:27,756
What happened?

899
00:59:29,022 --> 00:59:30,919
Fortunately, he woke up in time.

900
00:59:31,089 --> 00:59:33,205
Looked like the new stabilizer to me.

901
00:59:33,888 --> 00:59:35,723
What new stabilizer?

902
00:59:35,883 --> 00:59:38,349
We're trying out
a modified version of the old one.

903
00:59:38,543 --> 00:59:41,296
What's wrong with the unmodified
version of the old one?

904
00:59:41,558 --> 00:59:45,365
Well, nothing, really, but
there's always room for refinement.

905
00:59:46,809 --> 00:59:47,995
Wait a minute.

906
00:59:51,493 --> 00:59:53,411
I'm not going to make a point
out of the fact...

907
00:59:53,421 --> 00:59:55,456
That nobody told me what
was happening around here...

908
00:59:55,457 --> 00:59:57,068
Because I got a
bigger point to make.

909
00:59:57,188 --> 01:00:01,529
Lex, you and Von Elm must think we're running
an aeronautical laboratory around here.

910
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:03,390
We're designing planes,
refining planes,

911
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:05,519
We're modifying planes,
we're redesigning planes...

912
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,511
We're doing everything
but selling planes.

913
01:00:07,805 --> 01:00:09,602
Either we're in business
or we are not in business.

914
01:00:09,638 --> 01:00:11,829
Now, I think we got
a good plane there.

915
01:00:11,877 --> 01:00:15,998
Let's freeze the design, let's start
manufacturing, and let's start selling.

916
01:00:16,211 --> 01:00:18,088
And if you don't see it that way...

917
01:00:18,322 --> 01:00:21,409
I think we ought to sit down
right now and have a serious talk.

918
01:00:24,603 --> 01:00:26,295
In your office or mine?

919
01:00:34,465 --> 01:00:38,259
Every time Sage start stalking
like that, I get a little crazy.

920
01:00:38,753 --> 01:00:41,556
I don't want to win out anymore.
I just want to get out.

921
01:00:41,646 --> 01:00:43,443
I feel like I'm blushing all over.

922
01:00:44,744 --> 01:00:47,097
I'd hate to have
her think I'm a...

923
01:00:47,485 --> 01:00:48,914
What do you call me?

924
01:00:49,315 --> 01:00:50,986
A hot number.

925
01:00:51,484 --> 01:00:54,044
Lex is rich he doesn't give a hang
about business.

926
01:00:54,045 --> 01:00:56,636
I went into this business with the idea
of making make money...

927
01:00:56,637 --> 01:00:59,434
Not in five year, not next year,
tomorrow.

928
01:01:00,267 --> 01:01:02,603
All I could think
of was one thing.

929
01:01:05,543 --> 01:01:07,322
How much I wanted you.

930
01:01:07,532 --> 01:01:08,357
Well...

931
01:01:09,023 --> 01:01:11,929
If he and Von Elm are going to play
Tiddlywinks at the drawing board...

932
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:14,450
With Fritz Thornton's money
they are gonna have to do it without me.

933
01:01:14,673 --> 01:01:18,459
When we go there on Sunday, I'll tell them
either I get some control, or I want out.

934
01:01:26,665 --> 01:01:28,026
Darling?

935
01:01:32,032 --> 01:01:33,707
You talk too much.

936
01:01:34,674 --> 01:01:37,488
- So long, Mary, Jim.
- See you back at the house.

937
01:01:51,307 --> 01:01:53,179
Can we go inside for
a few minutes Mr Thornton?

938
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:54,299
You cold?

939
01:01:54,302 --> 01:01:56,273
No, I'd just like to have
a few words with you.

940
01:01:56,505 --> 01:01:58,527
Sure you don't want to
keep an eye on Mary?

941
01:01:59,201 --> 01:02:00,825
Why? She's a good skater.

942
01:02:01,564 --> 01:02:03,920
Well, that's not exactly
what I meant.

943
01:02:09,545 --> 01:02:11,464
You were my girl, right?

944
01:02:11,558 --> 01:02:13,279
Obviously I wasn't your girl.

945
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:16,460
You wouldn't say awful things, about
somebody you really cared about.

946
01:02:16,461 --> 01:02:17,899
Honey, you made a
fool out of me.

947
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,098
Did you think I'd be a
little gentleman about it?

948
01:02:20,341 --> 01:02:23,593
Jim, If you wanted to make me
feel terrible, you've succeeded.

949
01:02:45,393 --> 01:02:46,906
Jim, don't.

950
01:02:47,663 --> 01:02:49,747
Now when I hold a girl,
I pretend it's you.

951
01:02:49,875 --> 01:02:51,706
That's a filthy thing to say.

952
01:02:53,055 --> 01:02:55,500
I've had a dozen girls
since you left me...

953
01:02:56,988 --> 01:02:58,551
But they've all been you, Mary.

954
01:02:59,777 --> 01:03:01,524
That's the way
it's going to be with you.

955
01:03:02,464 --> 01:03:04,582
Some night in bed,
he'll turn into me.

956
01:03:13,204 --> 01:03:15,534
Are you angry, Alfred,
or just thinking?

957
01:03:17,191 --> 01:03:18,340
What?

958
01:03:18,375 --> 01:03:20,174
Oh, no, I'm not angry.

959
01:03:21,698 --> 01:03:24,193
I expected you
to support Lex and Von Elm.

960
01:03:27,787 --> 01:03:30,665
Well, I admit it would be easier
to make money now, Alfred...

961
01:03:30,966 --> 01:03:34,427
But it would be nothing compared
to what might come in 5 or 10 years...

962
01:03:34,428 --> 01:03:37,683
If the itch for quick profits could
remain unscratched for a while.

963
01:03:39,913 --> 01:03:40,762
Well...

964
01:03:41,175 --> 01:03:44,120
I guess I have to make a decision
then don't I, Mr Thornton?

965
01:03:45,829 --> 01:03:47,387
Yes, I guess you do.

966
01:03:48,181 --> 01:03:49,230
But not today.

967
01:03:49,231 --> 01:03:51,667
On the seventh day
the businessman should rest.

968
01:03:59,313 --> 01:04:02,036
If it was so much nothing
why were you running away from him?

969
01:04:02,334 --> 01:04:05,286
I was not running away.
My fingers were freezing.

970
01:04:05,519 --> 01:04:07,635
Now, do you want a wife
with frozen fingers?

971
01:04:08,886 --> 01:04:10,255
What did you two talk about?

972
01:04:11,022 --> 01:04:12,253
He still loves me.

973
01:04:12,945 --> 01:04:14,034
Thanks.

974
01:04:14,212 --> 01:04:17,276
You wouldn't have believed me if I said
we talked about the weather, would you?

975
01:04:17,971 --> 01:04:19,279
Did he kiss you?

976
01:04:21,985 --> 01:04:24,562
- I bet he tried to kiss you.
- Not only that.

977
01:04:24,563 --> 01:04:26,133
He picked me up in his arms...

978
01:04:26,134 --> 01:04:28,824
And carried me off across the
desert on a white charger.

979
01:04:28,825 --> 01:04:30,369
You're just trying
to make a joke out of it.

980
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:33,234
Darling, you're being silly.
I like him.

981
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:35,171
And I always have liked him.

982
01:04:35,684 --> 01:04:38,624
Now you can't expect me
to stop liking my men friends...

983
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:41,694
Any more than I can expect you
to stop liking your women friends.

984
01:04:41,849 --> 01:04:43,459
And I said liking!

985
01:04:43,534 --> 01:04:45,328
So let's not talk
about it anymore.

986
01:04:45,329 --> 01:04:46,866
That suits me fine.

987
01:04:51,129 --> 01:04:52,954
Sandy! Sandy!

988
01:04:53,064 --> 01:04:55,949
Alfred, stop the car. Look!

989
01:05:11,845 --> 01:05:13,836
Sandy fell in!

990
01:05:34,645 --> 01:05:37,682
Oh, sir! Mr MacHardie!
Sandy fell in.

991
01:05:38,586 --> 01:05:41,337
He wouldn't... Listen to me.

992
01:05:48,856 --> 01:05:50,523
Here, give him to me.

993
01:05:58,026 --> 01:05:59,122
Get away from here.

994
01:05:59,148 --> 01:06:01,519
- Who are you?
- I'm his grandfather.

995
01:06:06,813 --> 01:06:08,726
Call a doctor,
the fire department, hurry!

996
01:06:08,727 --> 01:06:09,655
Yes!

997
01:06:29,469 --> 01:06:30,732
It's all right.

998
01:06:45,405 --> 01:06:48,103
Well, you can't begrudge them
for wanting to thank you.

999
01:06:48,454 --> 01:06:50,431
I wish he'd let it go
at sending flowers.

1000
01:06:51,299 --> 01:06:54,924
Darling, you rescued the grandson
of James Duncan MacHardie,

1001
01:06:54,925 --> 01:06:57,962
Who is only the most famous
financier in America.

1002
01:06:57,963 --> 01:06:59,266
- Yes!
- I know.

1003
01:06:59,689 --> 01:07:02,124
We'll get a lot more
than a houseful of flowers...

1004
01:07:02,125 --> 01:07:04,434
And an evening of gratitude,
you can be sure.

1005
01:07:04,656 --> 01:07:06,100
I'll bet we are.

1006
01:07:06,142 --> 01:07:07,649
First he is going to look us over

1007
01:07:07,650 --> 01:07:09,959
To find out whether we're
sufficiently respectable.

1008
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:12,692
- You're going with that word again.
- And then, he's going to look me over...

1009
01:07:12,709 --> 01:07:14,964
To find out whether
my halo's bright enough...

1010
01:07:14,965 --> 01:07:20,085
To qualify me for one of those...
desks of his at number25 Wall Street.

1011
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:23,920
An aging fortress
of banking integrity.

1012
01:07:24,596 --> 01:07:26,691
You must admit
the timing's perfect...

1013
01:07:26,699 --> 01:07:30,153
For what with you planning to leave Lex
and no job in sight.

1014
01:07:30,154 --> 01:07:32,515
How do you know I'll take
his job if he offers me?

1015
01:07:33,319 --> 01:07:36,075
Because I know you, darling,
and you're very shrewd, darling...

1016
01:07:36,105 --> 01:07:38,340
You're not at all the kind of man...

1017
01:07:38,341 --> 01:07:41,484
To turn down the opportunity
of a lifetime, darling.

1018
01:07:41,485 --> 01:07:44,238
No matter how much
you protest, darling.

1019
01:07:45,629 --> 01:07:49,534
Besides, doesn't Wall Street close
up shop early in the afternoon?

1020
01:07:49,535 --> 01:07:52,686
I love the idea of your being
available to me more often.

1021
01:07:52,859 --> 01:07:54,336
Is that all it
would mean to you?

1022
01:07:54,915 --> 01:07:56,235
What's wrong with a girl...

1023
01:07:56,236 --> 01:07:58,257
Worrying about her own
needs now and then?

1024
01:08:08,866 --> 01:08:10,535
How nice of you to come.

1025
01:08:10,536 --> 01:08:13,073
I'm Jean Duffy,
Mr MacHardie's daughter,

1026
01:08:13,074 --> 01:08:15,800
- And Sandy's very grateful mother.
- How do you do.

1027
01:08:15,801 --> 01:08:18,112
- And this is my husband Creighton.
- Hello!

1028
01:08:18,252 --> 01:08:20,988
- We wanted to thank you alone...
- And we do.

1029
01:08:20,989 --> 01:08:24,602
But we also wanted Sandy to meet
the gentleman who saved his life.

1030
01:08:24,668 --> 01:08:26,260
Oh Sandy, dear.

1031
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,459
- This is Mrs Eaton.
- Hello, Sandy.

1032
01:08:30,488 --> 01:08:34,222
- And Mr Eaton you have met before.
- Glad you dried off.

1033
01:08:34,301 --> 01:08:37,227
Thank you very much for fishing
me out of the pond.

1034
01:08:37,228 --> 01:08:38,354
My pleasure.

1035
01:08:38,627 --> 01:08:40,421
- And?
- And...

1036
01:08:41,806 --> 01:08:45,141
Oh, yes. And it's a good thing
I wasn't any smaller...

1037
01:08:45,142 --> 01:08:46,136
Or...

1038
01:08:46,318 --> 01:08:48,350
Or you'd have had to throw me back.

1039
01:08:48,353 --> 01:08:49,796
Oh, very good.

1040
01:08:49,804 --> 01:08:52,449
- Good. Now, son, skedaddle.
- Good night, Sandy.

1041
01:08:52,452 --> 01:08:54,488
Now you're ready
for your cocktail.

1042
01:08:54,489 --> 01:08:57,034
Creighton, dear, will you and
Mrs Eaton lead the way?

1043
01:08:58,190 --> 01:09:00,370
You were very sweet to him, Mr Eaton.

1044
01:09:03,954 --> 01:09:05,687
I'd like you to meet
the other guests.

1045
01:09:06,029 --> 01:09:07,370
Here Mrs Ripley...

1046
01:09:07,963 --> 01:09:09,316
Lady Sevringham...

1047
01:09:10,176 --> 01:09:11,304
Mrs Pearson...

1048
01:09:11,474 --> 01:09:12,558
Lord Sevringham.

1049
01:09:12,825 --> 01:09:14,728
My father you know, of course.

1050
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:16,657
Glad to see you again, sir.

1051
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:18,317
And Mr Thornton.

1052
01:09:18,775 --> 01:09:19,940
Mr and Mrs Eaton.

1053
01:09:20,186 --> 01:09:21,614
I think that does it.

1054
01:09:22,857 --> 01:09:24,318
I didn't expect to see you here.

1055
01:09:24,905 --> 01:09:26,922
It might turn out
to be something of an occasion.

1056
01:09:29,292 --> 01:09:31,133
Watch out for Creighton Duffy.

1057
01:09:31,565 --> 01:09:33,283
He's a member
of MacHardie and Company...

1058
01:09:33,291 --> 01:09:35,128
But only because he's a son-in-law.

1059
01:09:35,788 --> 01:09:37,359
Resents competition.

1060
01:09:39,549 --> 01:09:42,685
You have a Portland, Oregon
and a Portland, Maine.

1061
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:46,845
Why, when you have a new country
like this and a splendid opportunity...

1062
01:09:46,846 --> 01:09:49,763
To start from scratch
with all-new names...

1063
01:09:49,764 --> 01:09:52,194
Why must you have two Portlands?

1064
01:09:53,031 --> 01:09:55,349
Well, we have a lot worse
than that Lady Sevringham....

1065
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:58,161
- You've heard of California.
- Of course, I have a friend there.

1066
01:09:58,162 --> 01:10:02,141
- And you've heard of Indiana.
- Yes, I think so, yes, Indiana.

1067
01:10:02,142 --> 01:10:05,744
- And Pennsylvania.
- Philadelphia is in Pennsylvania.

1068
01:10:05,745 --> 01:10:09,371
Yes, but you see, we have
a California in Pennsylvania...

1069
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:10,954
And an Indiana in Pennsylvania.

1070
01:10:11,144 --> 01:10:12,659
I'm not at all surprised.

1071
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:15,316
You have a place in New York
called the Polo Grounds...

1072
01:10:16,739 --> 01:10:20,254
And all they do there
is play baseball, and football.

1073
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:25,222
I never saw an elephant
in Piccadilly Circus. Did you?

1074
01:10:28,639 --> 01:10:32,791
Well, gentlemen, I think
brandy and cigars are in order.

1075
01:10:34,874 --> 01:10:37,544
Creighton,
will you play host in the lounge...

1076
01:10:37,545 --> 01:10:39,581
While I have a few words
with Mr Eaton?

1077
01:10:55,856 --> 01:10:58,137
I like the way you handle yourself,
young man.

1078
01:10:58,587 --> 01:10:59,815
It was a lucky shot.

1079
01:10:59,967 --> 01:11:03,198
I was not referring
to your manipulation of a cue stick.

1080
01:11:06,085 --> 01:11:08,504
I've made inquiries
about you, Mr Eaton...

1081
01:11:08,843 --> 01:11:11,089
And the results
have been most satisfying.

1082
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:13,441
I'm very flattered.

1083
01:11:14,689 --> 01:11:16,174
I'm not in the habit...

1084
01:11:16,947 --> 01:11:20,593
Of offering positions
with MacHardie and Company...

1085
01:11:20,594 --> 01:11:22,945
To men who qualify...

1086
01:11:23,373 --> 01:11:25,746
As lifeguards and nothing more.

1087
01:11:26,364 --> 01:11:27,964
That seems to make good sense,

1088
01:11:28,821 --> 01:11:31,803
Just as a sensible man...

1089
01:11:31,858 --> 01:11:34,311
Ought never to accept anything
that life has to offer...

1090
01:11:37,044 --> 01:11:39,243
Unless he's absolutely sure
that that's what he wants.

1091
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:41,842
Can a man be that sure of his goals?

1092
01:11:41,843 --> 01:11:42,869
I think so.

1093
01:11:43,432 --> 01:11:44,670
Tell me yours.

1094
01:11:46,017 --> 01:11:47,667
I want to live in a big world...

1095
01:11:47,668 --> 01:11:49,867
And compete with big people,
and make big money.

1096
01:11:50,631 --> 01:11:51,999
How big is big?

1097
01:11:52,315 --> 01:11:53,638
As big as you are, sir.

1098
01:11:53,731 --> 01:11:55,696
Certainly far bigger
than my father.

1099
01:11:57,019 --> 01:11:59,414
I always wanted
to top my father, too.

1100
01:12:00,135 --> 01:12:02,161
It helped me to achieve what I did...

1101
01:12:02,225 --> 01:12:05,137
Even if I fell short
by almost 30 million.

1102
01:12:05,549 --> 01:12:07,267
I don't intend to fall short.

1103
01:12:08,254 --> 01:12:11,477
And preferably not with your present
business associates?

1104
01:12:14,435 --> 01:12:17,252
There is such a thing
as information, Mr Eaton.

1105
01:12:18,524 --> 01:12:19,824
And you've got it.

1106
01:12:21,396 --> 01:12:23,795
How long will it take you
to clean up your affairs?

1107
01:12:23,796 --> 01:12:24,777
Two months.

1108
01:12:26,418 --> 01:12:27,869
Shall we join the ladies?

1109
01:12:28,141 --> 01:12:29,210
At your pleasure.

1110
01:13:10,445 --> 01:13:11,482
Yeah.

1111
01:13:13,049 --> 01:13:14,093
What?

1112
01:13:14,693 --> 01:13:16,247
You're right, Mary. I'm sorry.

1113
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:18,147
I said I'm sorry.

1114
01:13:20,064 --> 01:13:22,859
Well, why don't you go on ahead,
then and I'll meet you there.

1115
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:26,369
Yeah. What?

1116
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:28,046
Yeah. Right now. Absolutely.

1117
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:39,878
When will he get
back, does he say?

1118
01:13:40,258 --> 01:13:41,798
In time for
Christmas, he hopes.

1119
01:13:42,396 --> 01:13:43,909
What's he doing in California?

1120
01:13:44,243 --> 01:13:47,408
He's not in California.
That was last year. It's Colorado.

1121
01:13:47,963 --> 01:13:50,397
Alright! What's he doing in Colorado?

1122
01:13:50,673 --> 01:13:53,187
Buying a copper mine
for Mr MacHardie.

1123
01:13:53,266 --> 01:13:55,939
Well, make sure he buys you one, too.

1124
01:13:56,506 --> 01:14:00,493
I said how is every little thing
in Baton Rouge, Louisiana?

1125
01:14:00,765 --> 01:14:02,801
It is Louisiana, isn't it?

1126
01:14:03,565 --> 01:14:07,405
Alfred, you'll have to speak up.
I can't hear you.

1127
01:14:08,907 --> 01:14:13,265
Look, why don't you come a little
closer like... New York City?

1128
01:14:13,295 --> 01:14:15,411
That's in New York state, remember?

1129
01:14:16,985 --> 01:14:18,267
I am not.

1130
01:14:18,785 --> 01:14:21,333
I've only had one teeny
little glass of champagne.

1131
01:14:24,018 --> 01:14:25,815
Oh, just the usual crowd.

1132
01:14:25,816 --> 01:14:29,729
You know, Sage and Steve,
Nancy and Parker Wells and...

1133
01:14:30,407 --> 01:14:32,240
Nobody else you know, I don't think.

1134
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:35,728
Yes, dear, I will.

1135
01:14:37,575 --> 01:14:38,858
You, too.

1136
01:14:38,859 --> 01:14:40,302
Bye-bye.

1137
01:14:50,850 --> 01:14:53,762
Tell him we can meet
whenever it's convenient.

1138
01:14:53,835 --> 01:14:55,314
- Mr Eaton...
- Yes?

1139
01:14:55,315 --> 01:14:59,194
Mr MacHardie wishes
to have lunch with you at 12:00.

1140
01:14:59,195 --> 01:15:00,925
Alas I've another engagement.

1141
01:15:02,201 --> 01:15:04,471
It is now 3 minutes to 12:00, sir.

1142
01:15:05,456 --> 01:15:06,304
All right.

1143
01:15:06,305 --> 01:15:07,489
Thank you, sir.

1144
01:15:13,357 --> 01:15:14,966
See if you can catch
Mrs Eaton at home...

1145
01:15:14,967 --> 01:15:17,198
And if it's too late, just
call the restaurant.

1146
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:18,120
Yes.

1147
01:15:18,471 --> 01:15:21,304
You will be there posing
as one of our bond salesmen...

1148
01:15:21,313 --> 01:15:23,277
Opening up new territory...

1149
01:15:23,824 --> 01:15:25,999
Eyes open, ear to the ground.

1150
01:15:27,003 --> 01:15:30,593
Find out all you can about a man
named Ralph W. Benziger.

1151
01:15:30,873 --> 01:15:31,848
Benziger.

1152
01:15:31,849 --> 01:15:34,677
If we ever make sizable
commitments in that area...

1153
01:15:34,678 --> 01:15:37,596
This is the man
we might want to take charge...

1154
01:15:38,893 --> 01:15:40,447
Provided his hands are clean.

1155
01:15:40,654 --> 01:15:42,225
That's for you to find out.

1156
01:15:42,352 --> 01:15:44,925
The color of his hands,
what kind of man he is.

1157
01:15:45,527 --> 01:15:47,197
I would like to ask you
a question, sir.

1158
01:15:47,198 --> 01:15:50,747
Was it Mr Duffy that suggested me
for this expedition to Mountain City?

1159
01:15:51,585 --> 01:15:53,032
In the past, you might have felt...

1160
01:15:53,033 --> 01:15:55,831
That Mr Duffy recommended you
for other surveys...

1161
01:15:55,832 --> 01:15:59,990
Merely in order to keep you away
from home base for a month a the time.

1162
01:16:00,425 --> 01:16:02,541
Perhaps that may have been
in his mind.

1163
01:16:02,542 --> 01:16:04,805
Perhaps not, it's of no interest to me.

1164
01:16:04,806 --> 01:16:07,246
I am interested only in result.

1165
01:16:07,756 --> 01:16:11,094
And I may tell you, young man,
they have been enormously profitable

1166
01:16:11,095 --> 01:16:14,262
And largely owing to the shrewdness
of your reports.

1167
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:15,855
Thank you, sir.

1168
01:16:15,856 --> 01:16:18,922
Not to go beyond
the walls of this room...

1169
01:16:19,774 --> 01:16:23,505
The only gold stars on my son-in-law's
record during that time...

1170
01:16:23,816 --> 01:16:26,428
Have been his recommendation
of you for these assignments.

1171
01:16:26,701 --> 01:16:27,977
How long will I be gone?

1172
01:16:28,921 --> 01:16:30,851
You'll be there
about two months.

1173
01:16:31,057 --> 01:16:33,433
- Can I take my wife?
- I prefer not.

1174
01:16:33,559 --> 01:16:36,452
I suggest you plan to leave
not later than Friday night.

1175
01:16:36,843 --> 01:16:37,931
Friday night?

1176
01:16:39,037 --> 01:16:41,004
We just moved into
our New York apartment.

1177
01:16:41,005 --> 01:16:43,041
We've got 35 people
coming over on Sunday.

1178
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:45,580
I've never made
any sacrifice for this firm...

1179
01:16:46,004 --> 01:16:48,154
That I didn't feel amply repaid.

1180
01:16:48,155 --> 01:16:49,928
No dessert for me.

1181
01:16:50,579 --> 01:16:52,097
Good luck and good day to you.

1182
01:17:02,552 --> 01:17:03,624
Well, good night, Mary.

1183
01:17:03,625 --> 01:17:04,953
Thank you, Steve.

1184
01:17:19,817 --> 01:17:20,883
Good morning.

1185
01:17:22,265 --> 01:17:23,416
Good morning.

1186
01:17:24,937 --> 01:17:26,159
So why didn't you meet us?

1187
01:17:26,833 --> 01:17:28,261
Didn't you see the note I left?

1188
01:17:28,816 --> 01:17:31,416
I got home too late.
I had to finish that Dunham Report.

1189
01:17:32,649 --> 01:17:35,730
I suppose I'm supposed to know
what the Dunham Report is.

1190
01:17:36,782 --> 01:17:40,275
Oh, just one of the trivial little things
that helps pay to keep you...

1191
01:17:40,276 --> 01:17:43,174
Neck and neck with Harper's Bazaar.
Thank you.

1192
01:17:45,645 --> 01:17:48,180
Incidentally, just where
did you wear that little number...

1193
01:17:48,181 --> 01:17:49,736
Until 2:00 this morning?

1194
01:17:50,198 --> 01:17:52,582
I wore this little number
to the Mona Lisa.

1195
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:54,441
Would you unzip me
in the back, please?

1196
01:17:56,349 --> 01:17:58,540
I thought Sage
didn't like that place anymore.

1197
01:17:59,424 --> 01:18:00,876
Oh, Sage wasn't along.

1198
01:18:02,458 --> 01:18:04,708
She stayed home
with a bad tooth or something.

1199
01:18:05,958 --> 01:18:07,874
What do you mean, just you
and her husband?

1200
01:18:07,875 --> 01:18:09,511
Just little old us.

1201
01:18:10,393 --> 01:18:11,983
Can't you do any better than that?

1202
01:18:13,274 --> 01:18:14,789
As a matter of fact,
I could have...

1203
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:18,250
But unfortunately he had another date
with the Dingham Report.

1204
01:18:18,298 --> 01:18:19,607
Dunham.

1205
01:18:20,295 --> 01:18:21,755
Oh, so sorry. Dunham.

1206
01:18:22,885 --> 01:18:24,600
Suppose you tell me
what was so important...

1207
01:18:24,601 --> 01:18:26,319
That you left me
sitting alone today...

1208
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:29,081
Over a chicken salad sandwich
while you had lunch with MacHardie.

1209
01:18:29,777 --> 01:18:31,654
He's giving me a new assignment.

1210
01:18:33,405 --> 01:18:35,468
The coal regions of Pennsylvania.

1211
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:39,616
I'd give you the details,
but you're obviously not interested.

1212
01:18:41,327 --> 01:18:42,889
I have to leave Friday night.

1213
01:18:44,925 --> 01:18:46,974
And what about the
party on Sunday?

1214
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,212
I know. I'm sorry.

1215
01:18:50,213 --> 01:18:52,741
And just how long do you suppose
you'll be gone this time?

1216
01:18:53,244 --> 01:18:54,360
About two months.

1217
01:18:55,409 --> 01:18:59,906
And of course I am forbidden to go
with you or to visit you because...

1218
01:19:00,148 --> 01:19:01,859
It's not exactly forbidden, but...

1219
01:19:03,736 --> 01:19:05,183
The trouble with this company
is it's...

1220
01:19:05,556 --> 01:19:07,207
Run by one old man.

1221
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,591
I hope you know what
they're doing to us.

1222
01:19:10,530 --> 01:19:12,492
What do you want me to do, resign?

1223
01:19:13,138 --> 01:19:14,041
Let me tell you one thing.

1224
01:19:14,042 --> 01:19:16,686
I'm not going to sit around
and stare at four walls.

1225
01:19:16,687 --> 01:19:18,021
You don't have to sit here.

1226
01:19:18,022 --> 01:19:19,921
Well, if somebody invites me
to go to the theater...

1227
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:21,603
- I'm going to the theater.
- Go to the theater!

1228
01:19:23,805 --> 01:19:25,474
What if it's somebody
you don't know?

1229
01:19:26,212 --> 01:19:27,236
A man.

1230
01:19:27,245 --> 01:19:30,643
Now look, I don't want you having dates
with guys that I don't know.

1231
01:19:31,085 --> 01:19:33,360
Suppose it's somebody
you know and don't like?

1232
01:19:33,361 --> 01:19:34,420
For instance?

1233
01:19:35,507 --> 01:19:36,706
Jim Roper.

1234
01:19:38,513 --> 01:19:39,997
What made you think of him?

1235
01:19:41,037 --> 01:19:42,928
Because he's coming to the
party on Sunday.

1236
01:19:43,257 --> 01:19:44,763
How did that happen?

1237
01:19:45,386 --> 01:19:47,671
I ran into him on Fifth Avenue
and invited him.

1238
01:19:49,888 --> 01:19:51,914
In that case,
I'm glad I'm not going to be here.

1239
01:19:54,139 --> 01:19:56,434
It's probably just as well you're not
if that's your attitude.

1240
01:19:56,435 --> 01:19:58,153
Yeah, it is my attitude.

1241
01:19:58,439 --> 01:20:00,011
I'll tell you another thing
that's my attitude...

1242
01:20:00,012 --> 01:20:02,266
You're not going out with Jim Roper
and that's final!

1243
01:20:04,158 --> 01:20:07,127
- Final?
- Yes! That's final.

1244
01:20:07,917 --> 01:20:09,789
Well, I wouldn't be too sure.

1245
01:20:10,430 --> 01:20:12,397
You go just right along to Pennsylvania...

1246
01:20:12,398 --> 01:20:16,135
And you play with your grimy coal
miners, but don't be too sure.

1247
01:20:53,165 --> 01:20:54,534
Anything on that call to New York?

1248
01:20:55,544 --> 01:20:56,404
Come in.

1249
01:20:57,188 --> 01:20:58,339
Here you are, sir.

1250
01:20:58,640 --> 01:20:59,913
Keep trying, will you?

1251
01:21:02,221 --> 01:21:03,631
They're celebrating the football game.

1252
01:21:03,632 --> 01:21:04,886
No kidding.

1253
01:21:04,887 --> 01:21:05,919
They play on Sunday?

1254
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:09,183
Sure. Mountain City
beat the Steamrollers 28 to nothing.

1255
01:21:12,205 --> 01:21:12,797
Thanks.

1256
01:21:12,798 --> 01:21:15,915
Hey, you're that Providence left end.
I know you.

1257
01:21:15,916 --> 01:21:17,273
Nope. Sorry.

1258
01:21:18,393 --> 01:21:20,219
You played awful dirty.

1259
01:21:20,646 --> 01:21:22,427
You should have been thrown
out of the game.

1260
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:24,566
I was.

1261
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:27,036
No, you weren't, but
you should have been.

1262
01:21:28,746 --> 01:21:29,684
You're cute.

1263
01:21:30,564 --> 01:21:31,875
Come on in and join us.

1264
01:21:33,353 --> 01:21:34,940
I've got a couple of quarts.

1265
01:21:35,643 --> 01:21:36,682
I'm in training.

1266
01:21:37,189 --> 01:21:38,309
For what?

1267
01:21:39,299 --> 01:21:40,751
I'll bet you're married.

1268
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:42,958
You're absolutely right.

1269
01:21:43,945 --> 01:21:46,509
- My wife gave a party today.
- She did?

1270
01:21:46,963 --> 01:21:48,560
- You know who was there?
- Who?

1271
01:21:48,561 --> 01:21:49,593
Not me.

1272
01:21:51,229 --> 01:21:53,096
Why don't we stay in here, then?

1273
01:21:54,408 --> 01:21:55,877
I bet you won't be sorry...

1274
01:21:56,266 --> 01:21:58,124
'Cause when I like a fella...

1275
01:22:00,079 --> 01:22:03,092
- I hate to say no to a lady.
- Well, don't say it then.

1276
01:22:03,093 --> 01:22:04,298
But you got to beat it.

1277
01:22:04,299 --> 01:22:06,784
What do you mean beat it?
I just got in here.

1278
01:22:06,785 --> 01:22:08,509
Right, and you just went out.

1279
01:22:08,510 --> 01:22:11,415
Well, luck to you, Buckley!

1280
01:22:16,423 --> 01:22:19,045
- Hello. Hello, Mary?
- Hello!

1281
01:22:19,672 --> 01:22:21,078
I've been calling all evening.

1282
01:22:22,811 --> 01:22:23,904
Well, nobody was here.

1283
01:22:23,905 --> 01:22:26,249
We all went to dinner
at Michel's after the party.

1284
01:22:27,525 --> 01:22:28,760
Who's "we"?

1285
01:22:30,659 --> 01:22:33,536
Peg and Bill, Sage and Steve
and Jim Roper and I.

1286
01:22:33,663 --> 01:22:34,798
Who brought you home?

1287
01:22:36,301 --> 01:22:37,205
Jim.

1288
01:22:37,206 --> 01:22:39,804
- How long did he stay?
- About half an hour.

1289
01:22:40,781 --> 01:22:42,180
Are you going to see him again?

1290
01:22:42,277 --> 01:22:46,199
I don't know... Oh, yes. He'll be
at Peg and Bill's on Friday for dinner.

1291
01:22:46,813 --> 01:22:48,519
Then he'll undoubtedly
bring you home.

1292
01:22:49,091 --> 01:22:50,569
Possibly. I don't know.

1293
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:54,230
You know what you're doing,
don't you?

1294
01:22:54,361 --> 01:22:58,252
Yes. I'm showing you I won't stay
cooped up in this apartment...

1295
01:22:58,253 --> 01:23:01,819
While you run off free as a bird
all in the holy name of career.

1296
01:23:02,045 --> 01:23:05,068
Now, you listen to me, I don't want
that guy in our apartment anymore.

1297
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:09,724
Either you tell him, or I'll come back
and tell him myself.

1298
01:23:10,108 --> 01:23:11,576
Burt he'll have a...

1299
01:23:11,577 --> 01:23:13,998
Tough time explaining a busted head
to his patients.

1300
01:23:15,037 --> 01:23:17,472
Very well. I'll tell him.
Is that all?

1301
01:23:18,837 --> 01:23:20,101
Yeah, that's all.

1302
01:23:36,977 --> 01:23:38,884
You're not to come up here anymore.

1303
01:23:40,225 --> 01:23:42,819
People don't think this part
of the country as being cold.

1304
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:46,003
We have readings
of 15, 18, 20 degrees below.

1305
01:23:47,241 --> 01:23:49,974
You know, I'm glad you came in
to see me today, Mr Eaton.

1306
01:23:50,970 --> 01:23:53,113
I'm not always as talkative as this....

1307
01:23:53,114 --> 01:23:55,869
But maybe that's because I don't
run across many man like you...

1308
01:23:55,870 --> 01:23:57,364
Who are so willing to listen to me...

1309
01:23:57,365 --> 01:23:59,476
It's my pleasure, Mr Benziger.
I mean it.

1310
01:23:59,568 --> 01:24:01,035
That's mighty nice of you.

1311
01:24:01,805 --> 01:24:03,484
Makes me feel kind of poorly...

1312
01:24:03,485 --> 01:24:06,191
About not being in the market
for any bonds right now.

1313
01:24:06,924 --> 01:24:10,035
I know how it is for a young fellow
like you breaking in a new territory.

1314
01:24:10,036 --> 01:24:11,974
We've got our good days
and our bad days.

1315
01:24:11,975 --> 01:24:13,584
This happens to be
one of my good ones.

1316
01:24:15,117 --> 01:24:18,235
Local folks tell me you've been
making a few inquiries about me.

1317
01:24:20,306 --> 01:24:21,636
Yes, sir. A little.

1318
01:24:21,741 --> 01:24:24,328
If you heard anything disgraceful,
it's probably true.

1319
01:24:25,592 --> 01:24:27,284
You down here all by yourself?

1320
01:24:28,985 --> 01:24:30,162
Pretty lonesome town.

1321
01:24:30,773 --> 01:24:32,116
My wife's back in New York.

1322
01:24:32,125 --> 01:24:34,174
Oh... Taking care of
the kiddies, eh?

1323
01:24:35,826 --> 01:24:37,159
No. No kiddies.

1324
01:24:39,349 --> 01:24:40,668
Excuse me.

1325
01:24:41,601 --> 01:24:42,776
Yes?

1326
01:24:43,290 --> 01:24:44,571
Well, put her on.

1327
01:24:45,593 --> 01:24:46,947
Hello, Natalie.

1328
01:24:48,193 --> 01:24:50,414
Oh, let's see.

1329
01:24:51,430 --> 01:24:54,209
In about... 15 minutes.

1330
01:24:55,255 --> 01:24:57,485
Yeah, I will.
Oh, hold on a second.

1331
01:24:58,357 --> 01:25:00,471
You're all alone.
Why don't you join us for dinner?

1332
01:25:00,568 --> 01:25:01,860
We are having steak tonight...

1333
01:25:01,861 --> 01:25:04,112
You won't get as good a steak
down at the hotel, I guarantee.

1334
01:25:04,565 --> 01:25:06,929
- If that's an invitation, you sold me.
- Good.

1335
01:25:07,398 --> 01:25:08,358
Nat?

1336
01:25:08,686 --> 01:25:10,606
Tell Mother I'm bringing
a guest for dinner.

1337
01:25:11,530 --> 01:25:12,609
I will.

1338
01:25:13,290 --> 01:25:14,286
Bye.

1339
01:25:28,365 --> 01:25:31,764
Quiet, Rocco, it's all right, yes.

1340
01:25:33,029 --> 01:25:34,989
He can be pretty loud at times.

1341
01:25:35,289 --> 01:25:38,016
My wife and daughter are here
alone a good deal at night.

1342
01:25:40,119 --> 01:25:41,570
- Hello, Dad.
- Hi, Nat.

1343
01:25:41,596 --> 01:25:43,309
Natalie, this is Mr Eaton.

1344
01:25:43,733 --> 01:25:44,977
How do you do?

1345
01:25:46,642 --> 01:25:47,924
Won't you come in?

1346
01:25:53,694 --> 01:25:56,006
Oh, Dad.
Like the side of a matchbox.

1347
01:25:56,007 --> 01:25:58,863
I can't think why.
I shaved at 5:00 this morning.

1348
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:01,016
I'll take care of those, Mr Eaton.

1349
01:26:01,131 --> 01:26:04,700
They usually have a place for them under the
stairs but we're getting new shelves built.

1350
01:26:05,268 --> 01:26:06,293
Did you hear that, Dad?

1351
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:08,079
I heard it. I know.

1352
01:26:08,192 --> 01:26:09,532
I haven't finished them yet.

1353
01:26:10,494 --> 01:26:12,322
This is intended as
the start of a den...

1354
01:26:12,323 --> 01:26:14,880
But as you see, it's
as much office as den.

1355
01:26:15,245 --> 01:26:17,304
I'll go up and get Mother.
Be down in a minute.

1356
01:26:17,305 --> 01:26:18,280
Alright

1357
01:26:37,618 --> 01:26:40,065
I'd never seen a mine
before last Monday.

1358
01:26:40,643 --> 01:26:41,639
Is this one of yours?

1359
01:26:41,916 --> 01:26:43,434
Yes. That's number four.

1360
01:26:43,739 --> 01:26:47,254
Dad wanted to call it the Natalie, after me
of course, but he was overruled.

1361
01:26:47,746 --> 01:26:49,065
This one's number one.

1362
01:26:49,648 --> 01:26:52,228
It's the oldest, but
number four is our pride and joy.

1363
01:26:52,617 --> 01:26:55,746
When it was built, it was the most
electrified colliery in the world.

1364
01:26:59,412 --> 01:27:01,285
This is my favorite room
in the whole house.

1365
01:27:02,149 --> 01:27:03,899
I used to come here
and do my homework.

1366
01:27:04,925 --> 01:27:06,228
Especially your arithmetic.

1367
01:27:06,506 --> 01:27:07,628
Why do you say that?

1368
01:27:07,765 --> 01:27:09,111
So your father could help you.

1369
01:27:09,327 --> 01:27:11,097
No. I was very good in arithmetic...

1370
01:27:11,701 --> 01:27:13,441
But he did help me
with everything else.

1371
01:27:14,053 --> 01:27:16,362
And he'll be here in a second
and help you with a drink.

1372
01:27:16,694 --> 01:27:18,131
I'm in no hurry for one.

1373
01:27:18,702 --> 01:27:20,378
- Tell me something.
- Yes?

1374
01:27:21,673 --> 01:27:23,627
How does it feel
to be someone like you...

1375
01:27:24,122 --> 01:27:25,984
Blooming in a coal
town like this?

1376
01:27:26,276 --> 01:27:27,725
Do you really want to know?

1377
01:27:29,371 --> 01:27:30,593
Well, I love it here.

1378
01:27:31,304 --> 01:27:33,882
When the mountains are
covered with laurel or snow...

1379
01:27:34,369 --> 01:27:36,184
There's something
so beautiful about them.

1380
01:27:36,185 --> 01:27:37,578
And the people, too.

1381
01:27:37,729 --> 01:27:38,745
The miners.

1382
01:27:39,335 --> 01:27:40,701
The old ones, not the young.

1383
01:27:40,996 --> 01:27:42,774
I've been in so many of their homes.

1384
01:27:43,467 --> 01:27:45,054
Not much time left to them.

1385
01:27:45,426 --> 01:27:48,105
Not much to show
for working hard all their lives...

1386
01:27:48,727 --> 01:27:51,347
Yet they have such
dignity and wisdom...

1387
01:27:51,848 --> 01:27:53,349
Sorrow and pride.

1388
01:27:57,003 --> 01:27:58,814
Oh, Mother, this is Mr Eaton.

1389
01:27:58,950 --> 01:28:01,904
Good evening, Mr Eaton.
It's very nice of you to come.

1390
01:28:01,905 --> 01:28:03,211
Very kind of you to have me.

1391
01:28:03,212 --> 01:28:05,712
What is everyone standing around for?
Let's have a drink.

1392
01:28:05,747 --> 01:28:08,046
- Nothing for me, dear.
- Nor me, Dad.

1393
01:28:08,354 --> 01:28:10,874
What's the matter with you people?
Mr Eaton?

1394
01:28:10,875 --> 01:28:13,257
- Straight scotch is fine.
- That's my boy.

1395
01:28:13,258 --> 01:28:16,428
Only one drink now.
We don't want our steak ruined.

1396
01:28:20,180 --> 01:28:21,531
Welcome to our city.

1397
01:28:21,785 --> 01:28:23,015
Welcome to our home.

1398
01:28:23,597 --> 01:28:25,312
And all that's beautiful in it.

1399
01:28:26,726 --> 01:28:29,772
I guess we live closer
to basic instincts here...

1400
01:28:29,925 --> 01:28:31,848
Than some other regions
I could name.

1401
01:28:34,708 --> 01:28:37,545
These miners
are a pretty hard-bitten lot.

1402
01:28:39,726 --> 01:28:42,162
Sometimes they start home
a little drunk...

1403
01:28:42,612 --> 01:28:46,348
Fall down an air shaft,
get bitten by a rattlesnake,

1404
01:28:47,980 --> 01:28:49,121
Drown in a dam.

1405
01:28:50,571 --> 01:28:54,263
Yet I have to say
I can't blame the men...

1406
01:28:56,462 --> 01:28:58,427
Goodness, I had no idea.

1407
01:28:59,101 --> 01:29:00,879
Well, I can finish this tomorrow.

1408
01:29:02,223 --> 01:29:04,027
- Coming to bed?
- Maybe I'm a softie...

1409
01:29:04,749 --> 01:29:06,719
Baby the men too much, but...

1410
01:29:08,125 --> 01:29:11,477
- Good night, Mr Eaton.
- Good night. Thank you very much.

1411
01:29:11,478 --> 01:29:12,861
We enjoyed having you.

1412
01:29:13,585 --> 01:29:15,571
I guess I might as well
say good night, too.

1413
01:29:15,762 --> 01:29:18,454
Nat, would you keep
Mr Eaton company for a minute?

1414
01:29:31,564 --> 01:29:35,252
Mother has a heart condition.
She never stays up later than 10:00.

1415
01:29:36,341 --> 01:29:37,841
What do you do with your time?

1416
01:29:38,598 --> 01:29:41,162
Or do you... Have
a heart condition, too?

1417
01:29:42,405 --> 01:29:44,460
No, I have no particular
heart condition...

1418
01:29:44,731 --> 01:29:46,032
Of either kind.

1419
01:29:46,653 --> 01:29:50,047
I do some welfare work, digging the garden,
go to the movies...

1420
01:29:50,230 --> 01:29:51,373
The usual.

1421
01:29:52,278 --> 01:29:54,257
Would you go to the movies
with me sometime?

1422
01:29:54,535 --> 01:29:55,376
No.

1423
01:29:55,505 --> 01:29:56,711
'Cause I'm married?

1424
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,756
That's a pretty good reason, isn't it?
At least in Mountain City.

1425
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:03,704
And how about going to the movies
with me in Philadelphia?

1426
01:30:05,346 --> 01:30:07,882
Mr Eaton,
you probably have a very nice wife.

1427
01:30:11,290 --> 01:30:13,187
I suppose you're angry
because I asked you.

1428
01:30:15,091 --> 01:30:17,851
- No. I consider it a compliment.
- I hope you do.

1429
01:30:18,574 --> 01:30:21,325
You're the first person I've asked
out since I've been married.

1430
01:30:23,141 --> 01:30:25,263
- Thank you.
- There's some other things...

1431
01:30:25,264 --> 01:30:27,792
I really don't want to encourage
this conversation.

1432
01:30:31,096 --> 01:30:32,687
- Mother all right, Dad?
- Oh, yes.

1433
01:30:33,260 --> 01:30:35,984
I had some things to tell her.
I won't be seeing her in the morning.

1434
01:30:39,082 --> 01:30:40,361
I guess I'll be wandering along.

1435
01:30:40,568 --> 01:30:43,526
Natalie's having some people
for dinner Saturday.

1436
01:30:43,855 --> 01:30:45,659
It'd be nice if you came, too.

1437
01:30:46,044 --> 01:30:48,416
Dad, I don't think Mr Eaton
would really enjoy himself.

1438
01:30:48,417 --> 01:30:50,009
It's just our bridge club.

1439
01:30:50,522 --> 01:30:52,389
I'll take a rain check.
Some other time.

1440
01:30:52,675 --> 01:30:54,016
I think that would be better.

1441
01:30:54,123 --> 01:30:57,399
All right, but we do hope you'll
come back for dinner some time.

1442
01:30:57,865 --> 01:30:59,650
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.

1443
01:31:04,243 --> 01:31:05,661
- Good night.
- Good night.

1444
01:31:44,645 --> 01:31:45,688
Hello.

1445
01:31:46,325 --> 01:31:47,442
Hello.

1446
01:31:50,718 --> 01:31:51,624
Natalie?

1447
01:31:52,568 --> 01:31:54,194
I was just thinking about you.

1448
01:31:55,187 --> 01:31:56,666
What were you thinking?

1449
01:31:58,245 --> 01:31:59,812
I'm glad you did the right thing.

1450
01:32:00,816 --> 01:32:02,040
You said no and...

1451
01:32:03,263 --> 01:32:06,238
Turned me out into the cold
and lonely night.

1452
01:32:06,379 --> 01:32:07,455
Don't.

1453
01:32:08,732 --> 01:32:10,521
You saved me
from making a big mistake.

1454
01:32:14,345 --> 01:32:15,553
Maybe it was...

1455
01:32:15,554 --> 01:32:17,759
I who made the mistake.

1456
01:32:18,672 --> 01:32:20,111
What do you mean?

1457
01:32:21,325 --> 01:32:22,441
I don't know.

1458
01:32:23,699 --> 01:32:25,380
I'm not sure. Are you?

1459
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:27,636
No.

1460
01:32:29,798 --> 01:32:32,704
There's a drive-in movie
just outside of town.

1461
01:32:33,762 --> 01:32:35,700
The last show starts at 9:30.

1462
01:32:36,390 --> 01:32:37,280
Yes?

1463
01:32:40,962 --> 01:32:42,137
Tomorrow night?

1464
01:32:43,145 --> 01:32:44,186
Tomorrow night.

1465
01:32:45,538 --> 01:32:48,681
The last row of cars.
A yellow Plymouth convertible...

1466
01:32:49,945 --> 01:32:51,748
Slightly covered with coal dust.

1467
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:55,570
We're probably making a big mistake.

1468
01:32:56,369 --> 01:32:57,556
You know that, don't you?

1469
01:33:00,005 --> 01:33:01,090
Yes.

1470
01:33:03,546 --> 01:33:04,737
I know.

1471
01:33:07,670 --> 01:33:08,962
Good night.

1472
01:33:11,065 --> 01:33:12,324
Good night.

1473
01:34:00,657 --> 01:34:02,839
- Hello.
- Hello.

1474
01:34:31,945 --> 01:34:34,245
I guess we're the only two people
watching the movie.

1475
01:34:38,172 --> 01:34:40,003
- You know something?
- What?

1476
01:34:40,094 --> 01:34:41,989
I don't even know your first name.

1477
01:34:43,042 --> 01:34:45,619
Actually, it's David.
David Alfred Eaton.

1478
01:34:47,299 --> 01:34:49,227
See, I liked David,
and my father liked Alfred...

1479
01:34:49,229 --> 01:34:52,292
So it was Alfred.
May I call you David?

1480
01:34:52,565 --> 01:34:53,501
If you like.

1481
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:08,883
Do you believe in love
at first sight?

1482
01:35:09,123 --> 01:35:10,131
No.

1483
01:35:11,670 --> 01:35:12,589
Neither do I.

1484
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:15,635
I believe in confusion.

1485
01:35:18,318 --> 01:35:19,332
Yes.

1486
01:35:20,319 --> 01:35:21,828
A man walks around in a desert...

1487
01:35:22,146 --> 01:35:23,892
All his life looking for water.

1488
01:35:24,087 --> 01:35:25,512
All he ever finds is sand.

1489
01:35:27,189 --> 01:35:28,992
I didn't know you were
lost in the desert.

1490
01:35:29,987 --> 01:35:32,075
I didn't know it either
until last night.

1491
01:35:33,363 --> 01:35:35,340
I walked into a house
where there was warmth...

1492
01:35:36,155 --> 01:35:37,882
That didn't come from radiators.

1493
01:35:38,766 --> 01:35:40,958
I saw your mother and father,
and I saw you.

1494
01:35:42,494 --> 01:35:44,668
You're lonely.
You're away from home, that's all.

1495
01:35:47,282 --> 01:35:49,198
No. In one evening...

1496
01:35:49,667 --> 01:35:51,691
My whole life seemed to change.

1497
01:35:53,901 --> 01:35:55,680
I know it sounds ridiculous...

1498
01:35:56,699 --> 01:35:59,756
But you made me feel so I'd been
cheated out of something all my life.

1499
01:36:03,931 --> 01:36:04,950
It's funny...

1500
01:36:06,018 --> 01:36:08,869
That movie out there doesn't seem
so bad with the sound turned off.

1501
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:11,656
In other words,
you'd like me to shut up.

1502
01:36:13,122 --> 01:36:14,930
No. I'd like you to do
much more than that.

1503
01:36:39,545 --> 01:36:41,836
Now you've got me
lost in the desert.

1504
01:36:43,802 --> 01:36:45,158
I guess we're all out here...

1505
01:36:45,650 --> 01:36:46,714
Searching.

1506
01:36:50,829 --> 01:36:52,007
Even your wife?

1507
01:37:04,856 --> 01:37:08,295
I didn't sleep very well
last night after I left you...

1508
01:37:09,185 --> 01:37:12,464
And now many things
seem clearer to me.

1509
01:37:13,032 --> 01:37:15,374
I don't know if you're
still in love with your wife...

1510
01:37:16,362 --> 01:37:19,681
But I do know that you haven't
given up on your marriage.

1511
01:37:20,724 --> 01:37:24,409
I know if we stop now,
we'll never do injury to anyone...

1512
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:26,758
Except possibly ourselves.

1513
01:37:28,068 --> 01:37:29,764
I want to say goodbye...

1514
01:37:30,558 --> 01:37:31,963
But not in a letter.

1515
01:37:32,914 --> 01:37:34,426
So I'll have to see you...

1516
01:37:34,950 --> 01:37:36,378
One last time.

1517
01:38:12,501 --> 01:38:13,927
- Sure it's all right?
- What?

1518
01:38:14,931 --> 01:38:18,281
Oh, I don't know. Our cars
being parked so close together?

1519
01:38:19,728 --> 01:38:21,412
Nobody uses this road.

1520
01:38:22,092 --> 01:38:26,882
In fact, nobody knows this place
except wild rabbits and squirrels...

1521
01:38:28,115 --> 01:38:30,009
Chipmunks and field mice...

1522
01:38:30,684 --> 01:38:32,565
And birds and butterflies and...

1523
01:38:33,808 --> 01:38:36,277
- Falling leaves.
- Which one of those are you?

1524
01:38:36,635 --> 01:38:39,433
I don't know.
A squirrel, perhaps, or...

1525
01:38:42,722 --> 01:38:44,294
Maybe just a coward.

1526
01:38:54,765 --> 01:38:56,019
I saved your letter.

1527
01:38:57,757 --> 01:38:59,729
You know, I realize
something now, David.

1528
01:38:59,730 --> 01:39:00,793
What?

1529
01:39:02,283 --> 01:39:04,409
It was the proper way
to say goodbye.

1530
01:39:06,308 --> 01:39:08,111
- The only way.
- Natalie.

1531
01:39:08,565 --> 01:39:10,058
- Yes?
- Look at me.

1532
01:39:15,126 --> 01:39:16,301
You know something?

1533
01:39:19,425 --> 01:39:21,206
Even if we never
see each other again...

1534
01:39:23,132 --> 01:39:24,748
Something very good
has happened...

1535
01:39:27,119 --> 01:39:28,914
'Cause you'll know
for the rest of your life...

1536
01:39:31,507 --> 01:39:32,771
Just the sight of you...

1537
01:39:34,204 --> 01:39:35,031
Just the...

1538
01:39:35,381 --> 01:39:36,895
Just the sound of your voice...

1539
01:39:38,377 --> 01:39:39,540
Created a...

1540
01:39:40,062 --> 01:39:42,166
Feeling in me that was
so strong that I...

1541
01:39:42,927 --> 01:39:46,079
That I couldn't treat it
as polite conversation...

1542
01:39:47,341 --> 01:39:48,574
Or with silence.

1543
01:39:49,727 --> 01:39:50,917
And I...

1544
01:39:52,153 --> 01:39:53,550
I'll always remember...

1545
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:55,288
A sad...

1546
01:39:55,869 --> 01:39:56,758
Lonely...

1547
01:39:57,456 --> 01:39:58,696
Searching young man...

1548
01:40:00,143 --> 01:40:02,527
Who passed through my life
for a brief moment.

1549
01:40:05,581 --> 01:40:07,387
And I loved his sadness...

1550
01:40:10,547 --> 01:40:11,837
His loneliness...

1551
01:40:13,507 --> 01:40:14,944
His searching.

1552
01:40:23,901 --> 01:40:25,243
Please don't.

1553
01:40:40,349 --> 01:40:41,753
Well, I'll make it easier.

1554
01:40:43,845 --> 01:40:46,305
I'm leaving here. I'm going back
to New York tonight.

1555
01:40:48,785 --> 01:40:50,328
In three weeks up here I...

1556
01:40:51,075 --> 01:40:53,006
Accomplished all I set out to...

1557
01:40:54,275 --> 01:40:55,628
More than I intended.

1558
01:40:57,651 --> 01:40:59,449
Will we be writing to each other?

1559
01:41:00,212 --> 01:41:01,387
What do you think?

1560
01:41:02,148 --> 01:41:02,847
No.

1561
01:41:04,573 --> 01:41:05,801
Of course not.

1562
01:42:03,394 --> 01:42:04,895
Welcome back.

1563
01:42:06,305 --> 01:42:08,248
- I ordered for both of us.
- Fine.

1564
01:42:09,593 --> 01:42:13,604
I haven't studied your report,
but I did glance through it briefly.

1565
01:42:14,162 --> 01:42:15,504
And its thoroughness convinced me...

1566
01:42:15,505 --> 01:42:19,212
That I've no reason to be displeased
with you for coming back so soon.

1567
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:21,592
You did all that was expected of you.

1568
01:42:21,914 --> 01:42:24,481
I'm glad you agreed about Benziger.

1569
01:42:24,482 --> 01:42:25,615
Fine man.

1570
01:42:26,099 --> 01:42:28,151
However, that's not
what I wanted to talk about.

1571
01:42:29,036 --> 01:42:30,494
We don't want to be disturbed.

1572
01:42:35,869 --> 01:42:38,877
I'll get right to the point.
Have you seen your wife yet?

1573
01:42:39,087 --> 01:42:41,212
Or did you come here directly
from Mountain City?

1574
01:42:42,541 --> 01:42:44,819
Mary? No.
I got home last night.

1575
01:42:45,064 --> 01:42:46,854
She was still out on Long Island...

1576
01:42:47,666 --> 01:42:49,801
And she hadn't returned when
I left this morning. Why?

1577
01:42:50,328 --> 01:42:53,307
May I assume you're aware
of trouble in your home?

1578
01:42:54,365 --> 01:42:55,904
Would you care to be more specific?

1579
01:42:57,097 --> 01:42:58,980
Well, now, you see...

1580
01:42:59,449 --> 01:43:01,148
Our Mr Hasbrouck...

1581
01:43:01,377 --> 01:43:04,715
Who, as you know, has nothing
but the highest regard for you

1582
01:43:04,891 --> 01:43:07,325
Happens to live in Westport,
Connecticut.

1583
01:43:08,102 --> 01:43:09,323
And so it was inevitable...

1584
01:43:09,324 --> 01:43:12,722
He should hear about your wife's
presence at the home of a neighbor...

1585
01:43:12,723 --> 01:43:15,481
A certain Mr and Mrs Joseph Cash.

1586
01:43:16,005 --> 01:43:18,514
- Cash? I don't know them.
- No, you don't.

1587
01:43:18,630 --> 01:43:20,897
But Dr. James Roper does...

1588
01:43:21,583 --> 01:43:25,020
And it was there that he spent last
weekend, with your wife...

1589
01:43:25,655 --> 01:43:27,850
After the Princeton-Yale
football game.

1590
01:43:28,556 --> 01:43:31,569
You have my word for it,
or Mr Hasbrouck's word...

1591
01:43:31,958 --> 01:43:33,800
That that particular
host and hostess...

1592
01:43:33,801 --> 01:43:37,208
Make a practice of having
a houseful of guests every weekend...

1593
01:43:37,661 --> 01:43:39,823
The attraction being
that there'll be no checking...

1594
01:43:39,824 --> 01:43:41,799
On who sleeps in which room.

1595
01:43:51,332 --> 01:43:52,910
Aren't you jumping to conclusions?

1596
01:43:53,208 --> 01:43:56,190
I can assure you that
Mr Hasbrouck made quite certain...

1597
01:43:56,198 --> 01:43:58,531
That your wife's affair
was an open secret...

1598
01:43:58,791 --> 01:44:01,455
Before he invited
Eugene St. John to lunch.

1599
01:44:01,660 --> 01:44:03,047
Eugene St. John?

1600
01:44:03,420 --> 01:44:05,294
Their talk was most informal.

1601
01:44:05,434 --> 01:44:07,970
St. John agreed
to take no action right now...

1602
01:44:08,369 --> 01:44:10,022
But he promised to speak
to his daughter

1603
01:44:10,031 --> 01:44:13,287
If and when you decided it was
either necessary or advisable...

1604
01:44:13,660 --> 01:44:15,295
And that is where the matter stands.

1605
01:44:16,189 --> 01:44:18,146
That's not where the matter stands
where I'm concerned.

1606
01:44:18,147 --> 01:44:21,096
I don't think it's any of this firm's
damn business what my wife does.

1607
01:44:21,097 --> 01:44:25,473
And I'm surprised that Mr St. John didn't
tell Percy Hasbrouck to go to the devil.

1608
01:44:25,474 --> 01:44:28,566
He probably realized that what's
good for your promising future...

1609
01:44:28,567 --> 01:44:30,544
Is also good for his daughter's.

1610
01:44:30,545 --> 01:44:34,014
If there's anything that he,
or I, or anyone else can do...

1611
01:44:34,015 --> 01:44:36,106
To save your marriage
he's for it.

1612
01:44:36,107 --> 01:44:38,060
What if I don't want
to save my marriage?

1613
01:44:38,517 --> 01:44:39,584
Then we've failed.

1614
01:44:39,870 --> 01:44:41,485
Then you have failed, Eaton.

1615
01:44:42,119 --> 01:44:43,994
Divorce is a damnable thing.

1616
01:44:44,529 --> 01:44:45,775
It violates good order.

1617
01:44:45,776 --> 01:44:47,642
It's a threat to good order.

1618
01:44:47,777 --> 01:44:51,590
Isn't it just possible that infidelity
might be ground for a divorce?

1619
01:44:51,730 --> 01:44:53,536
There are no grounds
for divorce.

1620
01:44:53,845 --> 01:44:55,944
And if you want my personal theology...

1621
01:44:55,945 --> 01:44:57,715
Infidelity is the lesser sin.

1622
01:44:57,874 --> 01:45:00,519
I'd do anything in my power
to prevent a divorce.

1623
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:02,455
Including condoning infidelity?

1624
01:45:03,269 --> 01:45:05,573
I consider your word
"condone" disrespectful.

1625
01:45:05,574 --> 01:45:06,854
I condone none of it.

1626
01:45:07,219 --> 01:45:08,304
The problem of infidelity...

1627
01:45:08,305 --> 01:45:11,046
Is between husband,
and wife, and God.

1628
01:45:11,490 --> 01:45:14,557
The problem of divorce
concerns the whole of civilization.

1629
01:45:14,747 --> 01:45:15,778
What is marriage?

1630
01:45:16,185 --> 01:45:18,477
An exchange of vows, a contract.

1631
01:45:18,985 --> 01:45:22,864
It is my duty to myself
and to any man working for me...

1632
01:45:22,865 --> 01:45:25,537
To demand that he honor
all his contracts.

1633
01:45:26,021 --> 01:45:29,324
When you came here you found out
we always honor our word...

1634
01:45:29,325 --> 01:45:30,901
Even if it means taking a loss.

1635
01:45:31,198 --> 01:45:33,564
This is the first
opportunity you've had...

1636
01:45:33,565 --> 01:45:35,432
Of putting yourself to our test.

1637
01:45:36,369 --> 01:45:38,108
And if I don't choose
to meet your test?

1638
01:45:38,705 --> 01:45:41,086
You've worked
hard and well, Eaton.

1639
01:45:41,993 --> 01:45:44,860
You have a fine,
hard-earned record with us.

1640
01:45:45,578 --> 01:45:47,490
You can't afford
to throw that away.

1641
01:45:47,798 --> 01:45:50,499
With all due respect, sir,
I can afford to do as I please.

1642
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:52,351
And I say with all due respect...

1643
01:45:52,352 --> 01:45:54,424
That you can afford
nothing of the kind.

1644
01:45:58,275 --> 01:45:59,909
I wasn't going to tell you this.

1645
01:46:00,665 --> 01:46:02,926
I didn't want it to form
part of your decision...

1646
01:46:03,856 --> 01:46:06,119
But I like you, Eaton,
and I don't want to lose you.

1647
01:46:06,810 --> 01:46:10,450
And only you and I will know that
I mentioned it to you at this early date.

1648
01:46:10,451 --> 01:46:11,603
Mentioned what?

1649
01:46:12,031 --> 01:46:13,969
The roll-top desk.

1650
01:46:14,318 --> 01:46:15,569
The partnership.

1651
01:46:16,895 --> 01:46:19,182
I've had discussions
with the board...

1652
01:46:19,183 --> 01:46:21,309
And it's only a question of time...

1653
01:46:21,881 --> 01:46:24,623
And much less now
than you might suppose.

1654
01:46:31,611 --> 01:46:33,199
Stay where you are, son.

1655
01:46:33,817 --> 01:46:35,492
You've a lot of thinking to do.

1656
01:46:36,135 --> 01:46:37,718
But don't do it all now.

1657
01:46:38,035 --> 01:46:39,567
You've had a bad time.

1658
01:47:02,114 --> 01:47:03,666
Well, you're back.

1659
01:47:07,099 --> 01:47:09,135
- Was the trip successful?
- Yeah.

1660
01:47:10,701 --> 01:47:12,877
Are you back for good
or is this just a visit?

1661
01:47:13,778 --> 01:47:15,021
For good.

1662
01:47:16,632 --> 01:47:18,286
Finished up sooner
than you expected?

1663
01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:22,456
Sooner than you expected, too.

1664
01:47:22,929 --> 01:47:25,396
Now that I'm back you'll have to
start behaving yourself.

1665
01:47:25,459 --> 01:47:27,268
Did you say start?

1666
01:47:27,788 --> 01:47:29,885
I know all about you
and Roper at the Cashes'.

1667
01:47:31,588 --> 01:47:33,263
I could subpoena everybody
that was up there...

1668
01:47:33,264 --> 01:47:35,875
And divorce you in New York State,
right now if I wanted to.

1669
01:47:36,235 --> 01:47:39,148
But you won't because Mr MacHardie
wouldn't like that.

1670
01:47:39,404 --> 01:47:41,159
You think you're pretty
clever, don't you?

1671
01:47:41,160 --> 01:47:42,797
But you're not as clever
as you think you are.

1672
01:47:42,798 --> 01:47:44,114
Flaunting your affair publicly.

1673
01:47:44,115 --> 01:47:47,099
And I don't like a wife thumbing her nose at
me and thinking she can get away with it.

1674
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:49,547
And I don't like having a husband
who isn't a husband.

1675
01:47:49,854 --> 01:47:51,251
And what do you
think you're doing?

1676
01:47:51,252 --> 01:47:52,767
What does it look like I'm doing?

1677
01:47:52,768 --> 01:47:55,427
What do you expect me to do,
enter a convent?

1678
01:47:55,428 --> 01:47:56,700
And what about you?

1679
01:47:56,701 --> 01:48:00,324
I'm sure you'll find yourself
a woman, if you haven't already.

1680
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:02,205
You just better be careful.

1681
01:48:02,206 --> 01:48:05,757
You'd better be able to explain
every minute of your time, day and night.

1682
01:48:05,758 --> 01:48:06,804
Or you'll do what?

1683
01:48:06,805 --> 01:48:09,148
I'll put you where you're
so afraid of landing...

1684
01:48:09,149 --> 01:48:12,204
In the tabloids, page one, two,
or three. Take your choice!

1685
01:48:16,123 --> 01:48:18,197
I know why you're
doing this to me!

1686
01:48:18,199 --> 01:48:20,303
It's not our marriage
you're trying to hold together.

1687
01:48:20,304 --> 01:48:24,004
It's your own sick dream
of 5 million before you're 40!

1688
01:48:24,482 --> 01:48:27,183
Be the big man,
bigger than your father!

1689
01:48:34,202 --> 01:48:36,733
Mr Eaton, will you go directly into
the partners' room, please?

1690
01:48:38,250 --> 01:48:40,491
Mr Duffy, please go directly
into the partners' room.

1691
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:55,650
Creighton, come in.

1692
01:49:00,149 --> 01:49:02,125
Alfred, come in and sit down.

1693
01:49:04,589 --> 01:49:08,901
Now, we've been having a go at the Nassau
Aeronautical Corporation's proposal...

1694
01:49:10,225 --> 01:49:12,629
And we've been taking
under consideration...

1695
01:49:13,145 --> 01:49:17,024
Nassau's request that we underwrite
a common-stock issue...

1696
01:49:17,185 --> 01:49:19,125
To finance a plant expansion.

1697
01:49:19,692 --> 01:49:21,823
Nassau obviously wants to expand...

1698
01:49:21,824 --> 01:49:24,384
Because they expect
to land a sizable contract...

1699
01:49:24,385 --> 01:49:28,286
To manufacture their new
E1-FX plane for the Navy...

1700
01:49:28,485 --> 01:49:31,664
And it behooves us
to look into this E1-FX...

1701
01:49:32,369 --> 01:49:34,604
To see how good an aircraft it is...

1702
01:49:34,605 --> 01:49:38,200
Before we commit MacHardie
and Company to getting involved.

1703
01:49:38,795 --> 01:49:42,737
Sir, isn't the United States Navy's
interest in the planes...

1704
01:49:42,738 --> 01:49:44,582
Sufficient endorsement for us?

1705
01:49:45,564 --> 01:49:48,245
Ordinarily it should be,
but in this case...

1706
01:49:49,237 --> 01:49:52,462
My sixth sense tells me
that we ought at least to conduct...

1707
01:49:52,463 --> 01:49:57,008
A routine investigation of the E1-FX
before under writing the venture...

1708
01:49:57,287 --> 01:50:01,314
Particularly as we have on our team
a man so well qualified to do it.

1709
01:50:01,743 --> 01:50:05,372
Alfred, you're not only a personal
friend of Alexander Porter...

1710
01:50:05,630 --> 01:50:07,970
But you were yourself associated
with NAC...

1711
01:50:07,971 --> 01:50:09,927
In the days before it
rose to prominence...

1712
01:50:09,928 --> 01:50:11,920
In the aircraft
manufacturing field.

1713
01:50:12,525 --> 01:50:14,972
Some people seem to think that
my departure from Nassau...

1714
01:50:14,973 --> 01:50:16,503
Marked the beginning of its rise.

1715
01:50:19,214 --> 01:50:22,318
Wouldn't we be placing Mr Eaton
in a rather embarrassing position...

1716
01:50:22,335 --> 01:50:26,214
By asking him to attempt
to exercise impartial judgment...

1717
01:50:26,215 --> 01:50:29,717
Where his close friend
Mr Porter is concerned?

1718
01:50:30,647 --> 01:50:33,150
And who would you recommend
for the job, Creighton?

1719
01:50:35,176 --> 01:50:38,327
Well, sir, in as much as
I brought this venture...

1720
01:50:38,328 --> 01:50:41,081
To the firm's attention
and in as much as I'm familiar...

1721
01:50:41,082 --> 01:50:42,880
With all of its ramifications...

1722
01:50:43,293 --> 01:50:46,860
I have every confidence
in Mr Eaton's judgment and loyalty.

1723
01:50:47,344 --> 01:50:50,101
Alfred, how long will it take you
to get this underway?

1724
01:50:51,033 --> 01:50:53,868
By a fortunate coincidence,
Mrs Eaton and I...

1725
01:50:53,869 --> 01:50:56,910
Will be at Mr Porter's table
at a charity ball this Saturday night.

1726
01:50:56,941 --> 01:51:00,113
There's no rule that says that a man can't
take advantage of his host...

1727
01:51:00,406 --> 01:51:01,493
Is there?

1728
01:51:05,845 --> 01:51:08,819
I'd like to be able to say I'm close
to everything that goes on at Nassau,

1729
01:51:08,820 --> 01:51:10,496
But why give it all away?

1730
01:51:10,574 --> 01:51:13,809
I'm just the titular head,
if you'll pardon the expression.

1731
01:51:14,261 --> 01:51:15,581
Thanks to Uncle Fritz' money...

1732
01:51:15,582 --> 01:51:17,795
I reap the dividends,
the profits, and the credit.

1733
01:51:19,005 --> 01:51:20,220
Yes, thanks.

1734
01:51:20,468 --> 01:51:23,699
Von Elm's the real brains. He'll give
you all the facts you need.

1735
01:51:24,372 --> 01:51:25,718
You set it up with him?

1736
01:51:26,340 --> 01:51:27,951
I'll see you get the run of the place.

1737
01:51:27,952 --> 01:51:29,077
Thanks.

1738
01:51:31,118 --> 01:51:32,475
Can I ask you a corny question?

1739
01:51:32,501 --> 01:51:34,641
If you don't mind me giving
a corny answer.

1740
01:51:35,921 --> 01:51:38,987
Are you getting anything out
of your success besides more success?

1741
01:51:40,094 --> 01:51:41,618
Why don't you say what you mean?

1742
01:51:42,985 --> 01:51:45,560
- All right. Let's talk about Mary.
- Nothing to talk about.

1743
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:47,685
Things any better?

1744
01:51:49,202 --> 01:51:51,365
They're not any worse.
They'll never get any better.

1745
01:51:52,673 --> 01:51:55,979
- I'm not interested.
- Am I not good enough for you?

1746
01:51:55,980 --> 01:51:57,537
That's one way of putting it.

1747
01:51:57,538 --> 01:52:00,177
You won't be the first dissatisfied
wife I've made happy.

1748
01:52:00,283 --> 01:52:02,513
I'd like to go back to the table,
if you don't....

1749
01:52:03,478 --> 01:52:05,150
He doesn't even know
you're alive...

1750
01:52:05,151 --> 01:52:06,786
What kind of perfume
you're wearing, or...

1751
01:52:06,787 --> 01:52:08,033
How gorgeous you are.

1752
01:52:08,034 --> 01:52:10,255
This is not a secret,
Everyone knows it. So do you.

1753
01:52:10,256 --> 01:52:11,752
Wont you let go of me, please.

1754
01:52:11,753 --> 01:52:13,851
Don't throw an act on me.
I know all about you.

1755
01:52:14,151 --> 01:52:15,612
Do you?

1756
01:52:19,477 --> 01:52:21,468
Alfred, would you take me home,
please?

1757
01:52:21,709 --> 01:52:23,643
Why, I thought you were
having a merry old time.

1758
01:52:24,352 --> 01:52:26,866
- Good night Lex. It was delightful.
- Good night, princess.

1759
01:52:26,867 --> 01:52:28,854
- You were a charming host.
- But corny?

1760
01:52:36,121 --> 01:52:37,744
- Get my car, please.
- Yes, sir.

1761
01:52:57,198 --> 01:52:59,856
- Hello, Natalie.
- Hello.

1762
01:53:00,858 --> 01:53:02,216
It's nice to see you again.

1763
01:53:04,365 --> 01:53:06,571
Do you know my wife Mary?
Natalie Benziger.

1764
01:53:06,844 --> 01:53:09,391
- How do you do, Mrs Eaton?
- Hello, Miss Benziger.

1765
01:53:10,439 --> 01:53:11,951
What brings you to New York?

1766
01:53:12,735 --> 01:53:14,340
A little shopping expedition.

1767
01:53:14,469 --> 01:53:16,191
Are you here at the hotel
with your mother?

1768
01:53:16,437 --> 01:53:19,315
No. With a friend, Mrs English.
Caroline English.

1769
01:53:19,485 --> 01:53:21,870
- How's your father?
- He's fine, thank you.

1770
01:53:23,485 --> 01:53:25,852
Where did you two know each other
in Philadelphia?

1771
01:53:26,013 --> 01:53:28,393
Oh no, I tried to sell
Natalie's father some bonds...

1772
01:53:28,394 --> 01:53:30,483
That time when I was
down in Mountain City.

1773
01:53:32,360 --> 01:53:33,830
In Pennsylvania, remember?

1774
01:53:34,615 --> 01:53:36,131
Yes, I remember.

1775
01:53:38,010 --> 01:53:40,139
Well, good night, Mrs Eaton.

1776
01:53:40,773 --> 01:53:42,100
It's very nice meeting you.

1777
01:53:42,101 --> 01:53:43,893
- Good night, Natalie.
- Good night.

1778
01:54:07,832 --> 01:54:08,942
Well...

1779
01:54:10,006 --> 01:54:11,671
And what does she call you?

1780
01:54:14,084 --> 01:54:16,027
Miss... Benziger.

1781
01:54:17,229 --> 01:54:18,747
She calls me Mrs Eaton...

1782
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:20,932
You call her Natalie...

1783
01:54:20,933 --> 01:54:22,575
But she doesn't
call you anything.

1784
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:24,885
Aren't you Mr Eaton or Alfred?

1785
01:54:26,430 --> 01:54:28,191
As a matter of fact,
I'm Calvin Coolidge...

1786
01:54:28,192 --> 01:54:29,651
But she doesn't know that.

1787
01:54:33,125 --> 01:54:34,888
She's really quite lovely, you know.

1788
01:54:36,694 --> 01:54:38,243
And you know me. I like men.

1789
01:54:38,942 --> 01:54:40,329
So I'm told.

1790
01:54:42,498 --> 01:54:44,978
When she's that lovely,
I find it hard to hate her.

1791
01:54:46,573 --> 01:54:48,878
- I think you were lucky.
- I was?

1792
01:54:50,531 --> 01:54:52,876
Yes.
She has something I haven't got...

1793
01:54:54,315 --> 01:54:55,600
Niceness.

1794
01:54:57,616 --> 01:54:59,589
But then I have something
she hasn't got.

1795
01:54:59,694 --> 01:55:00,613
Me?

1796
01:55:01,356 --> 01:55:02,237
No.

1797
01:55:02,689 --> 01:55:04,491
Honesty and guts.

1798
01:55:05,405 --> 01:55:06,820
She has no guts.

1799
01:55:14,485 --> 01:55:15,750
What are you doing?

1800
01:55:16,039 --> 01:55:18,982
Don't worry. I'm not calling
your girl friend. I don't have to.

1801
01:55:23,424 --> 01:55:25,157
Dr Roper, please.

1802
01:55:29,506 --> 01:55:30,623
Hello, Jim?

1803
01:55:32,218 --> 01:55:33,506
Remember me?

1804
01:55:36,230 --> 01:55:37,390
Exactly.

1805
01:55:38,597 --> 01:55:40,974
Look,
why don't we have dinner sometime?

1806
01:55:43,310 --> 01:55:44,351
Tomorrow night?

1807
01:55:46,557 --> 01:55:47,871
Aren't I, though?

1808
01:55:49,289 --> 01:55:51,001
Fine. I'll meet you at your place.

1809
01:55:52,948 --> 01:55:54,083
Marvelous.

1810
01:56:00,295 --> 01:56:01,544
Any objections?

1811
01:56:03,872 --> 01:56:05,662
I have no facts and no evidence...

1812
01:56:06,654 --> 01:56:08,376
So this is what I'm going to do.

1813
01:56:08,377 --> 01:56:09,998
It's all I can do for now.

1814
01:56:10,349 --> 01:56:11,469
Just like that?

1815
01:56:11,662 --> 01:56:13,382
Yes, just like that.

1816
01:56:18,536 --> 01:56:22,495
I let you talk to foremen, designers,
mechanics, public relations men.

1817
01:56:22,496 --> 01:56:24,452
Everybody but the test pilot.

1818
01:56:26,545 --> 01:56:28,335
I'm sure
they told you everything they know.

1819
01:56:28,792 --> 01:56:30,388
They were instructed
to be cooperative.

1820
01:56:30,389 --> 01:56:33,117
I'll bet they were.
Everybody's been very helpful.

1821
01:56:33,315 --> 01:56:35,778
E1-FX is the greatest plane
to ever sprout wings.

1822
01:56:35,779 --> 01:56:37,425
I don't know, maybe it can fly, too.

1823
01:56:37,584 --> 01:56:38,895
What am I supposed
to say to that?

1824
01:56:38,896 --> 01:56:41,362
I don't want you
to say anything, Van Helm.

1825
01:56:42,478 --> 01:56:45,731
But before I go back to Wall Street
and report the failure of a mission...

1826
01:56:46,637 --> 01:56:49,120
I'll give you exactly one hour
to produce this test pilot...

1827
01:56:49,121 --> 01:56:51,685
That's been so mysteriously busy,
alas, this last three days.

1828
01:56:51,686 --> 01:56:52,862
Suppose I can't find him.

1829
01:56:52,863 --> 01:56:54,744
Then you're in the wrong business.

1830
01:56:54,745 --> 01:56:57,397
And don't think that won't
be in my report, too.

1831
01:56:58,072 --> 01:56:59,087
Wait a minute.

1832
01:57:00,885 --> 01:57:02,760
- Get Kelly In here.
- Yes, sir.

1833
01:57:03,087 --> 01:57:05,317
You know, if somebody like me
didn't know you as well as I do...

1834
01:57:05,318 --> 01:57:07,735
They might jump to conclusions
and figure you to walk in here...

1835
01:57:07,736 --> 01:57:10,284
with a whole set of prejudices
against us.

1836
01:57:10,285 --> 01:57:12,444
After all you left this company
when it was nothing...

1837
01:57:12,445 --> 01:57:14,481
Because you thought
it would always be nothing.

1838
01:57:14,700 --> 01:57:17,167
I'm glad I'm known so well
by somebody like you.

1839
01:57:18,729 --> 01:57:19,844
Come in.

1840
01:57:20,490 --> 01:57:22,222
- You sent for me, sir?
- Yes.

1841
01:57:22,401 --> 01:57:24,304
This is Jerry Kelly, our test pilot.
Mr Eaton.

1842
01:57:24,305 --> 01:57:25,821
- Glad to know you.
- Sit down Kelly!

1843
01:57:25,822 --> 01:57:28,151
No, I think Mr Kelly and I
can go for a little walk.

1844
01:57:28,308 --> 01:57:30,389
- What do you mean, a walk?
- You know!

1845
01:57:30,390 --> 01:57:32,795
That's when you put one foot
in front of the other.

1846
01:57:55,068 --> 01:57:56,754
All the time we've wasted.

1847
01:57:58,154 --> 01:57:59,693
I'll make it up to you.

1848
01:58:01,522 --> 01:58:03,125
I intend to make you do that.

1849
01:58:04,798 --> 01:58:08,193
Every time I'm with you this way
I get the strangest feeling.

1850
01:58:09,868 --> 01:58:11,452
Well, I'm a strange man.

1851
01:58:12,087 --> 01:58:13,408
Are you?

1852
01:58:14,426 --> 01:58:16,007
And you're a strange woman.

1853
01:58:16,665 --> 01:58:18,205
How am I strange?

1854
01:58:18,865 --> 01:58:20,978
- Haven't you discovered that yet?
- No.

1855
01:58:22,831 --> 01:58:24,529
Well, I'll let you find out.

1856
01:58:30,091 --> 01:58:31,258
Jim.

1857
01:58:33,324 --> 01:58:34,580
Do you love me?

1858
01:58:36,114 --> 01:58:37,170
Love you?

1859
01:58:38,977 --> 01:58:40,706
Honey, I adore you...

1860
01:58:41,833 --> 01:58:44,264
But I don't believe in love
any more than you do.

1861
01:58:45,511 --> 01:58:47,950
I believe in you wanting me
and me wanting you.

1862
01:58:48,998 --> 01:58:50,368
That's what brings you here...

1863
01:58:51,026 --> 01:58:53,257
And that's what will keep
us together.

1864
01:58:59,762 --> 01:59:01,856
Then I don't suppose
there's any...

1865
01:59:02,436 --> 01:59:03,674
Sense...

1866
01:59:03,798 --> 01:59:05,899
In us talking about marriage...

1867
01:59:06,740 --> 01:59:08,433
Or even thinking about it.

1868
01:59:12,654 --> 01:59:16,783
Look, let's have no more talk about
love or eternal devotion...

1869
01:59:17,402 --> 01:59:18,555
Shall we?

1870
01:59:20,414 --> 01:59:21,725
Jim!

1871
01:59:22,485 --> 01:59:25,397
Want me.
Please want me.

1872
01:59:43,547 --> 01:59:45,067
Oh, David...

1873
01:59:45,867 --> 01:59:48,339
The first real thing
in a whole long year.

1874
01:59:49,620 --> 01:59:50,945
I had to see you again.

1875
01:59:51,102 --> 01:59:53,359
This is really why
I came to New York.

1876
01:59:58,856 --> 02:00:00,272
Well, I'm glad you did.

1877
02:00:06,461 --> 02:00:08,099
I've been wondering...

1878
02:00:08,747 --> 02:00:10,805
Wondering about so many things.

1879
02:00:11,498 --> 02:00:13,728
- You have?
- Yes.

1880
02:00:14,945 --> 02:00:16,321
Your wife, she's...

1881
02:00:16,948 --> 02:00:18,883
Lovelier than I thought she'd be.

1882
02:00:20,735 --> 02:00:22,532
And you're still with her,
aren't you?

1883
02:00:24,504 --> 02:00:26,060
We live under the same roof.

1884
02:00:27,491 --> 02:00:28,810
That's all.

1885
02:00:32,579 --> 02:00:33,595
David...

1886
02:00:34,301 --> 02:00:36,040
Is there someplace we can go?

1887
02:00:44,133 --> 02:00:45,313
So there it is.

1888
02:00:45,678 --> 02:00:46,846
Or there it was.

1889
02:00:48,404 --> 02:00:49,825
I could have
divorced her for it.

1890
02:00:49,992 --> 02:00:51,428
I could have, but I didn't...

1891
02:00:52,345 --> 02:00:54,710
Because it would have meant
damaging my career.

1892
02:00:55,784 --> 02:00:57,221
God help me.

1893
02:00:58,107 --> 02:01:00,542
My career seems
to be more important...

1894
02:01:00,543 --> 02:01:02,138
Than I ever thought it could be.

1895
02:01:03,715 --> 02:01:05,786
I put you out of my mind...

1896
02:01:06,437 --> 02:01:08,407
And buried myself in my work...

1897
02:01:09,162 --> 02:01:10,781
Even deeper than before.

1898
02:01:11,734 --> 02:01:13,808
But... I guess it never
really worked...

1899
02:01:15,482 --> 02:01:17,526
Because whenever
I thought of you, it was...

1900
02:01:19,573 --> 02:01:21,211
It was always with love.

1901
02:01:24,382 --> 02:01:25,577
Then the other night...

1902
02:01:26,037 --> 02:01:27,068
The moment I saw you...

1903
02:01:27,069 --> 02:01:29,634
It was like seeing you
that very first time.

1904
02:01:32,004 --> 02:01:34,250
But I felt real danger
for both of us.

1905
02:01:37,065 --> 02:01:38,501
You see, that's why...

1906
02:01:39,623 --> 02:01:41,663
I wish I'd had the courage
not to phone you.

1907
02:01:43,445 --> 02:01:46,104
So be careful, Natalie,
I have nothing to offer you...

1908
02:01:47,265 --> 02:01:49,278
Except pain, deep, tender,
loving pain...

1909
02:01:49,279 --> 02:01:50,936
And I don't want to hurt you.

1910
02:01:52,629 --> 02:01:54,400
You understand what
I'm trying to say?

1911
02:01:54,775 --> 02:01:55,878
Yes, I do.

1912
02:01:56,182 --> 02:01:58,800
If you had any sense
you'd get up from the table...

1913
02:01:58,802 --> 02:02:00,511
And never see me again.

1914
02:02:00,537 --> 02:02:02,313
Do you want me to?

1915
02:02:30,325 --> 02:02:31,804
Oh, David.

1916
02:02:33,005 --> 02:02:35,397
I can't bear being with you
any longer...

1917
02:02:36,103 --> 02:02:37,156
Just talking.

1918
02:02:39,382 --> 02:02:41,528
- Is there someplace we can go?
- No, Natalie.

1919
02:02:41,529 --> 02:02:42,928
A hotel?

1920
02:02:43,930 --> 02:02:45,462
You wouldn't like that.

1921
02:02:48,471 --> 02:02:49,293
No.

1922
02:02:49,819 --> 02:02:51,499
Neither would you.

1923
02:02:55,930 --> 02:02:58,024
But arrange it, darling, please.

1924
02:03:04,242 --> 02:03:05,897
Busy, busy, busy.

1925
02:03:07,731 --> 02:03:09,567
How's the Nassau Investigation going?

1926
02:03:11,592 --> 02:03:13,533
Don't you want to wait
for my report?

1927
02:03:13,534 --> 02:03:14,960
Only if I have to.

1928
02:03:16,744 --> 02:03:18,671
Don't worry. You'll get
the whole story tomorrow.

1929
02:03:19,919 --> 02:03:23,644
I hear you had a talk with their
test pilot, a fellow named Kelly?

1930
02:03:23,945 --> 02:03:24,940
That's right.

1931
02:03:27,294 --> 02:03:29,269
You know, you saved
my son's life once.

1932
02:03:29,471 --> 02:03:32,376
Who knows, you might want to do the same
for the boy's old man some day.

1933
02:03:32,377 --> 02:03:35,494
Creighton, you skate on thin ice,
you're going to get your feet wet.

1934
02:03:36,345 --> 02:03:38,320
Weren't you skating
on thin ice last night...

1935
02:03:38,321 --> 02:03:39,860
Making love in public
to a young lady...

1936
02:03:39,861 --> 02:03:41,824
Who bears no resemblance
to your wife?

1937
02:03:42,150 --> 02:03:43,935
You should be more careful, Alfred.

1938
02:03:51,114 --> 02:03:53,517
Now, wait a minute.
Let's be a little realistic.

1939
02:03:53,866 --> 02:03:56,251
You and I may want to do
each other a big favor.

1940
02:03:56,323 --> 02:03:59,023
You can do me a favor right now,
just by getting out of the way.

1941
02:03:59,454 --> 02:04:00,701
Now, you know as well as I do...

1942
02:04:00,702 --> 02:04:03,043
That Mr MacHardie
has some hidebound notions...

1943
02:04:03,044 --> 02:04:05,886
About improper behavior
around here... Scandal!

1944
02:04:05,887 --> 02:04:07,204
You mean like the
improper way...

1945
02:04:07,205 --> 02:04:10,594
You tried to turn the Nassau deal
into your own private gain?

1946
02:04:10,595 --> 02:04:11,984
I got proof...

1947
02:04:12,285 --> 02:04:15,161
And I plan to put it in front of
the board at tomorrows meeting.

1948
02:04:15,638 --> 02:04:16,998
Oh, you wouldn't do that...

1949
02:04:17,315 --> 02:04:19,190
Because if you do,
you go with me.

1950
02:04:19,365 --> 02:04:20,976
You and your plaything.

1951
02:04:21,468 --> 02:04:23,153
Why don't you go
jump in the lake?

1952
02:04:23,154 --> 02:04:24,780
Oh no, that's your specialty!

1953
02:04:24,781 --> 02:04:27,267
That's how you got
into this company in the first place.

1954
02:04:46,214 --> 02:04:47,089
Sir...

1955
02:04:47,656 --> 02:04:50,956
Could I interest you in a set
of the Encyclopedia Britannica?

1956
02:04:52,322 --> 02:04:55,057
Step right this way, young lady
and we will discuss the matter.

1957
02:04:55,083 --> 02:04:56,278
Thank you.

1958
02:05:07,476 --> 02:05:09,986
Oh, darling, hold on to me.

1959
02:05:10,543 --> 02:05:12,193
Don't let me run away.

1960
02:05:14,158 --> 02:05:17,191
I almost didn't come.
I turned back twice.

1961
02:05:22,411 --> 02:05:24,206
You know, we don't have to stay here.

1962
02:05:24,934 --> 02:05:27,551
We could go for a walk
or out for dinner, go to the mov...

1963
02:05:43,102 --> 02:05:44,376
Champagne?

1964
02:06:14,404 --> 02:06:15,324
Come here.

1965
02:06:29,236 --> 02:06:30,148
Look.

1966
02:06:30,667 --> 02:06:32,333
It's lovely.

1967
02:06:34,325 --> 02:06:37,335
You know, I think I'm going
to remember this night for all time.

1968
02:06:38,253 --> 02:06:40,926
And someday, when we finally part...

1969
02:06:41,690 --> 02:06:44,391
I'll go to Spain
and live with my memories.

1970
02:06:47,180 --> 02:06:49,667
As soon as I see you
getting tired of me.

1971
02:06:50,632 --> 02:06:52,756
You'll be too old to travel
when that happens.

1972
02:08:09,790 --> 02:08:11,153
I love you.

1973
02:08:14,027 --> 02:08:16,221
More than I ever thought
I could love anybody.

1974
02:08:17,914 --> 02:08:19,879
And I love you, David.

1975
02:08:28,799 --> 02:08:31,394
- Message from Mr Duffy.
- Get out!

1976
02:08:31,395 --> 02:08:33,197
- Get more of the girl.
- I got plenty of her.

1977
02:08:33,198 --> 02:08:34,816
Let's get out of here.

1978
02:08:41,010 --> 02:08:42,342
Come on, let's go!

1979
02:08:50,064 --> 02:08:51,736
Why do I feel this...

1980
02:08:53,332 --> 02:08:54,727
This kind of death?

1981
02:08:54,879 --> 02:08:56,059
Of what?

1982
02:08:59,133 --> 02:09:00,604
I don't know.

1983
02:09:02,612 --> 02:09:06,175
You were just thinking of what
your mother and father would feel...

1984
02:09:06,176 --> 02:09:08,588
If they saw one of those
photographs of us.

1985
02:09:09,087 --> 02:09:11,402
I wasn't thinking that,
and I won't let you.

1986
02:09:15,593 --> 02:09:17,646
Can't keep it out
of your mind forever.

1987
02:09:20,462 --> 02:09:22,435
Unless I play ball
with Duffy tomorrow...

1988
02:09:24,073 --> 02:09:26,323
You're going to be undressed
in public...

1989
02:09:26,969 --> 02:09:28,607
Smeared all over the newspapers.

1990
02:09:28,608 --> 02:09:30,716
I don't care.
You got to believe that.

1991
02:09:31,203 --> 02:09:32,512
I knew what I was doing....

1992
02:09:32,513 --> 02:09:35,027
And I've got to accept the consequences,
whatever they are.

1993
02:09:35,028 --> 02:09:37,023
Well, I won't let them
do it to you.

1994
02:09:37,500 --> 02:09:38,911
Not to me.

1995
02:09:39,548 --> 02:09:41,436
If you're going to let that man
blackmail you...

1996
02:09:41,437 --> 02:09:43,070
it's to protect your career.

1997
02:09:43,628 --> 02:09:45,891
Everything you've worked for,
not me.

1998
02:09:49,263 --> 02:09:50,334
You see?

1999
02:09:50,857 --> 02:09:52,549
That's the death I feel.

2000
02:09:53,741 --> 02:09:56,640
There will always be that uncertainty
for you, won't there?

2001
02:09:57,503 --> 02:09:59,334
Why you did it, for whom.

2002
02:10:00,742 --> 02:10:02,615
I don't think
I could live with that.

2003
02:10:03,214 --> 02:10:05,057
Is there somewhere we
can end this kind of talk?

2004
02:10:05,058 --> 02:10:07,422
You're very close to saying
final things, Natalie.

2005
02:10:08,219 --> 02:10:09,798
Maybe they have to be said.

2006
02:10:10,617 --> 02:10:13,024
Maybe there never really
was any future for us...

2007
02:10:14,542 --> 02:10:18,090
And it took your friend Mr Duffy
to wake us up from the dream.

2008
02:10:20,989 --> 02:10:22,717
You know what you're doing,
don't you?

2009
02:10:23,915 --> 02:10:26,459
Sending me back to Mary
and yourself back to Mountain City.

2010
02:10:26,460 --> 02:10:28,052
Is that what you want?

2011
02:10:30,638 --> 02:10:32,330
Well, if it is, why don't you say so?

2012
02:10:33,395 --> 02:10:34,976
Because the moment I do...

2013
02:10:36,646 --> 02:10:38,637
I'll feel that my life is over.

2014
02:10:41,258 --> 02:10:43,142
You're trying to force me
to say it, then.

2015
02:10:45,453 --> 02:10:47,098
I guess maybe I am.

2016
02:10:50,419 --> 02:10:51,581
All right, then...

2017
02:10:52,732 --> 02:10:54,296
If that's the way you want it.

2018
02:10:56,757 --> 02:10:58,140
Goodbye, Natalie.

2019
02:11:00,501 --> 02:11:01,978
Goodbye.

2020
02:11:36,760 --> 02:11:38,112
Is something wrong?

2021
02:11:42,669 --> 02:11:44,351
Anything you want to unload?

2022
02:11:44,488 --> 02:11:46,120
The least I can do is listen.

2023
02:11:50,965 --> 02:11:52,637
You know something, Alfred?

2024
02:11:54,813 --> 02:11:57,142
You and I could have
such a pleasant relationship...

2025
02:11:57,143 --> 02:11:59,397
If you'd just unbend a little.

2026
02:11:59,423 --> 02:12:00,996
What kind of relation ship?

2027
02:12:01,529 --> 02:12:04,027
Whatever we like,
whenever we like it, silly.

2028
02:12:06,083 --> 02:12:07,449
Of course I know there's...

2029
02:12:07,742 --> 02:12:09,940
No love lost between us, but...

2030
02:12:12,274 --> 02:12:15,424
If you'd just stop playing
the role of the aggrieved husband...

2031
02:12:15,425 --> 02:12:17,892
We might have the same
enjoyable relationship...

2032
02:12:17,893 --> 02:12:19,746
That a lot of our
married friends have.

2033
02:12:21,859 --> 02:12:24,576
Well, I've seen you look at me when
I knew you wanted me...

2034
02:12:26,266 --> 02:12:28,008
And I certainly wanted you.

2035
02:12:29,464 --> 02:12:32,409
And you just turned around
and walked back in your own bedroom.

2036
02:12:33,822 --> 02:12:36,151
I always thought, He's such a fool...

2037
02:12:37,247 --> 02:12:38,422
Such a waste.

2038
02:12:43,011 --> 02:12:45,781
Now, wouldn't it be nicer if
we were friends this way?

2039
02:12:45,862 --> 02:12:47,043
Shut up.

2040
02:12:51,532 --> 02:12:54,145
You look like an old man
tonight, Alfred.

2041
02:12:54,897 --> 02:12:57,045
What's the matter, your girl friend
giving you trouble?

2042
02:12:57,046 --> 02:12:58,468
I don't want to talk about it.

2043
02:12:59,791 --> 02:13:01,520
I hope you haven't been
stringing her along...

2044
02:13:01,521 --> 02:13:03,569
And telling her you
were going to get a divorce.

2045
02:13:03,924 --> 02:13:07,359
Knowing women, I'm sure
she kept hoping you would.

2046
02:13:07,999 --> 02:13:09,799
And now she's angry
because you won't.

2047
02:13:10,176 --> 02:13:11,991
I always knew she had no guts.

2048
02:13:13,381 --> 02:13:14,724
Well, am I wrong?

2049
02:13:15,026 --> 02:13:18,018
Is your girlfriend holding out
on you and demanding marriage?

2050
02:13:18,019 --> 02:13:19,345
Mary, please.

2051
02:13:20,687 --> 02:13:22,590
Well, if it'll do you any good
you can tell her...

2052
02:13:22,591 --> 02:13:25,996
It's not just your boss-man Mr MacHardie
who's standing in your way.

2053
02:13:26,774 --> 02:13:28,800
You can tell her that
you also have a wife...

2054
02:13:28,802 --> 02:13:30,724
Who happens to like
her marital arrangement...

2055
02:13:30,725 --> 02:13:32,767
And doesn't intend to change it.

2056
02:13:34,069 --> 02:13:35,236
Why not?

2057
02:13:35,907 --> 02:13:38,900
It gives me status, security
and a wonderful kind of freedom.

2058
02:13:40,178 --> 02:13:41,895
Well, why are you staring at me?

2059
02:13:51,359 --> 02:13:52,400
When I think...

2060
02:13:53,125 --> 02:13:55,336
Of the misery that we've
brought each other...

2061
02:13:56,476 --> 02:13:59,511
The wasted years,
betrayals, humiliations...

2062
02:14:00,705 --> 02:14:02,210
I'm not blaming you for it.

2063
02:14:03,620 --> 02:14:04,889
I guess I did as much
as you did...

2064
02:14:04,891 --> 02:14:08,042
To destroy whatever we had
between us, but it's gone now.

2065
02:14:09,215 --> 02:14:10,808
It's beyond recovery, dead.

2066
02:14:14,702 --> 02:14:16,042
That's all right.

2067
02:14:17,900 --> 02:14:19,187
We don't need it.

2068
02:14:20,537 --> 02:14:21,469
As a matter of fact...

2069
02:14:21,470 --> 02:14:23,678
Maybe it would be more
interesting without it.

2070
02:14:28,838 --> 02:14:30,676
I'm going to bed now, Alfred.

2071
02:14:40,180 --> 02:14:42,514
I'm really not that bad, remember?

2072
02:15:00,502 --> 02:15:01,593
- Mr Eaton?
- Yeah.

2073
02:15:01,594 --> 02:15:02,719
Sign here, please.

2074
02:15:10,114 --> 02:15:11,377
Thank you.

2075
02:15:22,135 --> 02:15:24,841
"All I ask is your friendship
at the meeting tomorrow. Creighton"

2076
02:15:26,301 --> 02:15:28,648
Before we hear Mr Eaton's report...

2077
02:15:28,649 --> 02:15:31,816
On the Nassau Aeronautical
Corporation situation...

2078
02:15:32,218 --> 02:15:34,344
I have a few words to say...

2079
02:15:34,553 --> 02:15:36,654
Of a very happy nature.

2080
02:15:38,713 --> 02:15:40,239
All right, Henry.

2081
02:15:40,755 --> 02:15:45,146
I know you'll forgive me for breaking
one of our more tire some traditions...

2082
02:15:45,505 --> 02:15:49,844
If I decorate this stale
but profitable room today...

2083
02:15:50,029 --> 02:15:53,013
With the presence
of an attractive young lady.

2084
02:15:54,589 --> 02:15:55,948
Gentlemen...

2085
02:15:56,168 --> 02:15:57,709
Mrs Alfred Eaton.

2086
02:15:58,151 --> 02:15:59,655
How do you do?

2087
02:16:00,367 --> 02:16:01,880
Right over there, Mary.

2088
02:16:05,432 --> 02:16:09,516
Mrs Eaton was let into our little
secret, several days ago...

2089
02:16:10,501 --> 02:16:14,235
And if I may judge by the look
of surprise on her husband's face...

2090
02:16:14,525 --> 02:16:16,436
She's kept her secret
better than most women...

2091
02:16:16,470 --> 02:16:18,088
Are considered capable of doing.

2092
02:16:21,019 --> 02:16:24,190
And now, Alfred, I come to something
which is no secret...

2093
02:16:24,475 --> 02:16:28,796
And that is the high esteem
in which you are held by this firm.

2094
02:16:29,146 --> 02:16:32,707
I speak not only for myself,
but for all my partners.

2095
02:16:33,859 --> 02:16:36,497
You have dedicated yourself
to your work...

2096
02:16:36,645 --> 02:16:40,115
With a devotion that might serve
as an example to all young men...

2097
02:16:40,116 --> 02:16:42,136
Who aspire to success.

2098
02:16:43,077 --> 02:16:46,363
You have sacrificed your own
pleasures and pastimes for us.

2099
02:16:46,703 --> 02:16:48,933
You have traveled all over
the country for us.

2100
02:16:49,214 --> 02:16:53,425
You've sat at your desk until 3:00
and 4:00 in the morning for us.

2101
02:16:53,642 --> 02:16:57,081
And time and again you have executed
difficult assignments...

2102
02:16:57,082 --> 02:17:00,992
With more boldness and courage
than we had any right to expect.

2103
02:17:01,682 --> 02:17:04,992
Not only that.
And this is especially important.

2104
02:17:05,357 --> 02:17:07,825
You have made us proud
of your performance...

2105
02:17:07,826 --> 02:17:10,094
In the private walks
of your life as well.

2106
02:17:10,623 --> 02:17:12,447
I think you know
what I mean now.

2107
02:17:12,891 --> 02:17:15,046
There you have
conducted yourself...

2108
02:17:15,047 --> 02:17:18,483
With a wisdom, maturity, good taste...

2109
02:17:18,814 --> 02:17:22,528
And a fine sense of responsibility
to your business position.

2110
02:17:22,918 --> 02:17:26,041
And in a few moments I think
you'll see why it was worth it.

2111
02:17:26,972 --> 02:17:28,893
It's now time to be specific.

2112
02:17:29,446 --> 02:17:33,061
As long we were all going
to be assembled here today...

2113
02:17:33,062 --> 02:17:35,735
I thought this would be
the proper occasion...

2114
02:17:35,736 --> 02:17:39,365
To tell you before you read about
it in the Wall Street Journal...

2115
02:17:39,462 --> 02:17:42,513
That you have just become
the first man...

2116
02:17:42,514 --> 02:17:44,470
On the sunny side of 40...

2117
02:17:44,491 --> 02:17:48,643
Ever to be made a full partner
of MacHardie and Company.

2118
02:17:49,667 --> 02:17:51,283
Congratulations, Alfred.

2119
02:17:51,301 --> 02:17:52,776
Congratulations.

2120
02:17:52,777 --> 02:17:54,904
- Congratulations, Alfred.
- Congratulations.

2121
02:17:54,905 --> 02:17:56,519
Congratulations, Mrs Eaton.

2122
02:17:56,520 --> 02:17:57,931
Congratulations.

2123
02:17:58,371 --> 02:17:59,736
Congratulations.

2124
02:18:04,830 --> 02:18:06,400
Now, then...

2125
02:18:16,805 --> 02:18:18,143
Mr MacHardie...

2126
02:18:19,157 --> 02:18:20,527
Gentlemen, I...

2127
02:18:22,277 --> 02:18:23,792
I am deeply honored.

2128
02:18:25,533 --> 02:18:27,045
I'm flattered by...

2129
02:18:27,489 --> 02:18:29,966
Your generous bestowal
of a partnership...

2130
02:18:32,201 --> 02:18:33,609
'Cause this is a day...

2131
02:18:34,083 --> 02:18:35,988
That I have been working toward...

2132
02:18:36,927 --> 02:18:39,277
With every fiber of my being.

2133
02:18:40,162 --> 02:18:41,449
For like all...

2134
02:18:41,663 --> 02:18:43,989
Well-brought-up American males

2135
02:18:44,482 --> 02:18:46,413
I have always been aware of the fact...

2136
02:18:47,071 --> 02:18:49,505
That nothing
is more important in life...

2137
02:18:50,081 --> 02:18:51,823
Than the attaining of wealth...

2138
02:18:52,767 --> 02:18:54,087
And high position.

2139
02:18:56,419 --> 02:19:00,401
And I can honestly say that I never
allowed anything to sway me...

2140
02:19:00,402 --> 02:19:01,881
From my goal of achieving it.

2141
02:19:02,042 --> 02:19:03,754
When business called...

2142
02:19:03,755 --> 02:19:06,401
I never let personal responsibilities
stand in the way.

2143
02:19:06,682 --> 02:19:09,140
If anything ever threatened
to interfere...

2144
02:19:09,141 --> 02:19:11,496
With the affairs
of MacHardie and Company...

2145
02:19:12,260 --> 02:19:13,989
I always knew...

2146
02:19:14,560 --> 02:19:16,563
That there would only be one choice...

2147
02:19:16,845 --> 02:19:18,740
And I invariably made it.

2148
02:19:19,272 --> 02:19:21,580
Because I have truly learned, gentlemen...

2149
02:19:21,955 --> 02:19:24,405
As Mr MacHardie
so gracefully put it...

2150
02:19:26,162 --> 02:19:27,886
That it does take wisdom...

2151
02:19:28,457 --> 02:19:29,704
Maturity...

2152
02:19:30,063 --> 02:19:31,309
Good taste...

2153
02:19:32,173 --> 02:19:37,134
And a fine sense of responsibility
to one's business position...

2154
02:19:38,539 --> 02:19:40,457
If one is to get ahead
in this world.

2155
02:19:41,222 --> 02:19:44,124
Some men think
in very small terms, gentlemen.

2156
02:19:44,901 --> 02:19:47,574
If they find themselves
married to a woman...

2157
02:19:47,986 --> 02:19:49,812
Who has been unfaithful to them...

2158
02:19:51,929 --> 02:19:55,579
They dissolve the marriage just as
if they owed no responsibility...

2159
02:19:55,580 --> 02:19:58,014
To the... Business firm
for which they worked.

2160
02:19:59,258 --> 02:20:01,809
And if they find genuine happiness
with another woman...

2161
02:20:02,953 --> 02:20:05,257
They embrace it...
As if they had...

2162
02:20:05,560 --> 02:20:07,141
No consideration...

2163
02:20:08,529 --> 02:20:10,231
Of their business colleagues.

2164
02:20:10,762 --> 02:20:13,543
These men do not become
successful, gentlemen.

2165
02:20:14,299 --> 02:20:17,397
They do not become full partners
at MacHardie and Company.

2166
02:20:19,285 --> 02:20:21,798
They become abject failures.

2167
02:20:23,181 --> 02:20:25,938
They take their place alongside
the millions of...

2168
02:20:26,821 --> 02:20:29,379
Mediocrities who value...

2169
02:20:29,539 --> 02:20:31,110
A houseful of kids...

2170
02:20:31,627 --> 02:20:33,079
A host of friends...

2171
02:20:33,219 --> 02:20:35,721
Photograph albums filled
with trivial memories...

2172
02:20:35,722 --> 02:20:38,944
Above all the truly
important considerations...

2173
02:20:39,491 --> 02:20:40,964
Of this world.

2174
02:20:42,861 --> 02:20:45,061
With all due modesty, gentlemen...

2175
02:20:46,543 --> 02:20:49,535
I feel that I have earned
the position you have given me today.

2176
02:20:49,544 --> 02:20:51,989
No one here deserves it
more truly than I.

2177
02:20:51,990 --> 02:20:54,070
- Just one second...
- I'm not through yet.

2178
02:20:54,840 --> 02:20:58,381
My first act as a partner
will be... To deliver my report...

2179
02:20:58,382 --> 02:21:00,420
On the Nassau
Aeronautical situation.

2180
02:21:01,003 --> 02:21:02,485
And after you've read about it...

2181
02:21:02,486 --> 02:21:05,758
I'm sure that...
My friend Mr Duffy there...

2182
02:21:05,759 --> 02:21:08,261
Will want to issue another
report on another subject...

2183
02:21:08,262 --> 02:21:11,146
Namely, the newest partner
of MacHardie and Company...

2184
02:21:11,147 --> 02:21:13,448
The newest and possibly
the shortest-lived.

2185
02:21:13,449 --> 02:21:15,599
And now gentlemen,
if you will excuse me...

2186
02:21:15,600 --> 02:21:18,827
I have other less important
business to attend to.

2187
02:21:19,542 --> 02:21:20,927
Sorry.

2188
02:21:22,062 --> 02:21:25,611
- What is the meaning of this?
- What's the matter with him?

2189
02:21:32,479 --> 02:21:33,621
Alfred!

2190
02:21:33,622 --> 02:21:36,495
I know you've come to congratulate me.
Thank you very much my dear.

2191
02:21:36,496 --> 02:21:38,951
- You're making a fool of yourself.
- That was terribly...

2192
02:21:38,952 --> 02:21:41,068
Considerate of you last night
when you were telling me...

2193
02:21:41,069 --> 02:21:43,813
About the
"beautiful relationship we could have"...

2194
02:21:43,814 --> 02:21:46,141
But you never mentioned
the partnership.

2195
02:21:46,142 --> 02:21:47,645
Because maybe I would've thought...

2196
02:21:47,646 --> 02:21:50,173
That the partnership had something
to do with your new-found...

2197
02:21:50,174 --> 02:21:52,981
If somewhat unwholesome
interest in our marriage.

2198
02:21:52,982 --> 02:21:53,936
Alfred.

2199
02:21:55,089 --> 02:21:56,599
Alfred, I want to talk to you.

2200
02:21:56,600 --> 02:21:58,556
Any further communication
between you and me...

2201
02:21:58,557 --> 02:22:00,172
Will be through legal channels.

2202
02:22:00,299 --> 02:22:01,497
Alfred!

2203
02:22:02,787 --> 02:22:05,851
Alright go ahead and go to her,
but it won't do you any good.

2204
02:22:05,852 --> 02:22:07,664
If she's foolish enough
to still have me...

2205
02:22:07,665 --> 02:22:10,321
Nothing will stop me from spending
the rest of my life with her.

2206
02:22:10,322 --> 02:22:13,251
- I'll never give you a divorce.
- No you won't, ah?

2207
02:22:13,608 --> 02:22:15,534
Wait till you see the photographs...

2208
02:22:15,535 --> 02:22:18,527
That our friend Creighton Duffy is gonna
let loose for public consumption.

2209
02:22:18,528 --> 02:22:19,201
What photographs?

2210
02:22:19,202 --> 02:22:21,002
You won't be able to show
your face in this entire city...

2211
02:22:21,003 --> 02:22:22,474
If you don't give me a divorce.

2212
02:22:22,475 --> 02:22:24,315
How do you like them apples?

2213
02:22:27,138 --> 02:22:28,495
Alfred!

2214
02:22:31,041 --> 02:22:32,215
Alfred!
