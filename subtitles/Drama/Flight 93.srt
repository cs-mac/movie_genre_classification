Any idea where you fly to ?

95
00:13:35,000 - > 00:13:38,360
People ask for help , they think
 that an ordinary emergency

96
00:13:38,480 - > 00:13:40,970
They asked for a doctor.
But there is no doctor on board .

97
00:13:41,040 - > 00:13:42,760
They still think
it was a heart attack .

00:14:02,500 - > 00:14:05,250
perhaps it is not red .
We give her oxygen .

109
00:14:17,940 - > 00:14:19,270

I see water, buildings .
We fly low .

112
00:14:25,040 - > 00:14:27,250
We are flying very low .

113
00:14:28,980 - > 00:14:31,180
We are flying way too low .

114
00:14:32,020 - > 00:14:33,220
My God ...

115
00:14:34,220 - > 00:14:35,620
Do you hear me , Amy ?

116

122
00:16:30,520 - > 00:16:33,640
Ostensibly flew a plane
against the World Trade Center ...

123
00:16:34,720 - > 00:16:37,700
You see life images ,
of how the plane ...

124
00:16:38,000 - > 00:16:39,930
becomes one of the towers ,
just below the top ...

125
00:16:40,160 - > 00:16:43,160
And here from another angle .
Everywhere is debris ...

126
00:16:43,460 - > 00:16:47,640
smoke coming from about
ten floors of the tower .

127
00:16:48,840 - > 00:16:51,490

to this accident ,
which took place at 8:45 this morning ...

131
00:17:02,480 - > 00:17:05,520
We have not heard anything
about potential victims .

132
00:17:06,080 - > 00:17:09,520
The aircraft can be on your way
been to Newark or Kennedy .

133
00:17:09,640 - > 00:17:15,320
It chose a different direction ,
turned towards Newark ...

134
00:17:15,620 - > 00:17:19,080
How a plane daytime
can fly ... at the tower

135
00:17:19,380 - > 00:17:20,920
is difficult to understand .

136

there was a bomb on board.
- That's what we thought ...

320
00:37:48,280 - > 00:37:52,160
However, it was not clear.
Executive 956 aircraft at 12 o'clock ,

I'll get you out of there .

324
00:37:58,880 - > 00:38:02,080
He appears to be rising .
- I want everybody out there.

325
00:38:03,800 - > 00:38:05,800
I think we
see him .

326
00:38:05,920 - > 00:38:10,220
1989 , I have traffic at 11 o'clock , 15 miles
south and climbing .

327
00:38:10,520 - > 00:38:12,680
He seems to turn to east 360.

328
00:38:13,800 - > 00:38:16,760
This is the captain , we have
a bomb on board.

329
00:38:19,080 - > 00:38:22,160
We return to the airport.
They accede to our demands .

330
00:38:22,840 - > 00:38:25,520
United 93 .
I call on United 93 .

331
00:38:28,060 - > 00:38:29,960
You have pressed the wrong button .

00:38:38,280 - > 00:38:41,830
Here again the power feed ,
We have a bomb on board .

333
00:38:42,600 - > 00:38:45,200
We go back to the airport .

334
00:38:45,280 - > 00:38:46,880
They accede to our demands .

335
00:38:54,760 - > 00:38:57,880
Back to the airport?
- Forget it.

336
00:39:09,460 - > 00:39:11,710
Stay here , I 'll be right back .

337
00:39:34,810 - > 00:39:39,160
Ziad , they get suspicious .

343
00:40:06,600 - > 00:40:08,080
Mom ...

344
00:40:10,120 - > 00:40:12,360
Jeremy 's me.
Are you okay ?

345
00:40:14,440 - > 00:40:17,290
There are bad men
on board .

346
00:40:19,160 - > 00:40:21,440
Our plane is hijacked .

347
00:40:21,520 - > 00:40:24,640
They come from the middle east,
perhaps Iran .

348
00:40:26,560 - > 00:40:27,680
Okay .

349
00:40:29,040 - > 00:40:30,600
Are you hurt?

350
00:40:31,160 - > 00:40:33,540
No, we're behind
the plane.

351
00:40:33,560 - > 00:40:35,860
One of them has
a bomb around his waist .

352
00:40:35,940 - > 00:40:38,540
I can not believe
that this happens to me .

353
00:40:38,820 - > 00:40:40,410
It's good.

354
00:40:42,100 - > 00:40:45,980
I can not believe
that this is really happening .

355
00:40:47,460 - > 00:40:49,490
They want to blow up the plane .

356
00:40:49,840 - > 00:40:50,920
My God .

357
00:40:51,260 - > 00:40:56,400
There's a bomb in Jeremy
on board .

358
00:40:57,280 - > 00:40:59,480

359
00:40:59,780 - > 00:41:01,500

It's good.

364
00:41:16,540 - > 00:41:20,690
Honestly Liz , ...
I do not think I ed.

365
00:41:21,400 - > 00:41:22,680
Do not be silly .

00:41:23,560 - > 00:41:24,920
That does not happen .

367
00:41:25,520 - > 00:41:27,760
That does not happen , Jeremy ,
I will not allow it.

368
00:41:31,780 - > 00:41:35,220
You must know ,
whatever you do ...

00:41:35,740 - > 00:41:38,240
Do not talk .
I love you .

We 'll figure it out .

372
00:41:46,160 - > 00:41:49,370
Wait a minute , wait a second .

373
00:41:52,920 - > 00:41:53,960
Jeremy .

374
00:41:59,720 - > 00:42:00,560

00:42:07,080 - > 00:42:09,570

378
00:42:11,320 - > 00:42:12,360
Hello Mark .

379
00:42:12,760 - > 00:42:16,360
Mother this is Mark .
I'm on a flight from Newark ...

380
00:42:16,660 - > 00:42:19,820
to San Francisco , there are three
men on board ...

381
00:42:19,840 - > 00:42:22,420
with a bomb .
- A bomb ?

382
00:42:23,960 - > 00:42:26,640
Mark . Who are they?

383
00:42:27,940 - > 00:42:30,500
Can anyone fly?
Yes , I'm single .

384
00:42:31,160 - > 00:42:33,670
This is not single !

385
00:42:34,320 - > 00:42:36,060
Can you land?

386
00:42:36,920 - > 00:42:38,400
I do not know , I think so .

387
00:42:38,520 - > 00:42:40,320
What is the alternative .

388
00:42:41,080 - > 00:42:41,960
Mark .

389
00:42:42,680 - > 00:42:44,920
Mark , who are these men?

390
00:42:45,320 - > 00:42:46,440
Do you believe me ?

391
00:42:46,760 - > 00:42:49,240
Yeah , who are these men?

392
00:42:49,360 - > 00:42:50,160
Mother .

393
00:42:50,920 - > 00:42:51,880
Mark .

394
00:42:52,920 - > 00:42:54,040
Are you still there?

395
00:42:55,920 - > 00:42:56,720
Mother .

00:42:57,280 - > 00:42:58,160
Mark .

00:43:25,320 - > 00:43:27,600

bring school ?

400
00:43:29,240 - > 00:43:30,560
Thank you very much .

401
00:43:33,560 - > 00:43:35,720
These are life images
of the event .

402
00:43:35,840 - > 00:43:38,640
Jerry , witnesses on Highway 110
saw a plane ...

403
00:43:38,760 - > 00:43:40,870
fly in the building.

404
00:43:41,320 - > 00:43:45,190
It flew in the southwest wing ...
 - Oh , my God.

405
00:43:48,380 - > 00:43:49,260
Tom .

406
00:43:49,540 - > 00:43:52,140
Deena .
- You all right ?

407
00:43:53,260 - > 00:43:54,380
I do not think so .

408
00:43:55,420 - > 00:43:56,550
She just flew in
the Pentagon , I thought ...

409
00:43:56,800 - > 00:43:59,040
it was your plane .

410
00:43:59,620 - > 00:44:02,060
What ?
- They flew into the Pentagon .

411
00:44:05,260 - > 00:44:08,140
They flew into the Pentagon .

412
00:44:10,780 - > 00:44:14,530
They believe that it all
commercial flights .

413
00:44:14,980 - > 00:44:18,640
They said nothing ,
but they are all scheduled flights ...

414
00:44:18,940 - > 00:44:20,740
from the east coast .

415
00:44:20,960 - > 00:44:22,840
You know who's involved ?

416
00:44:22,960 - > 00:44:23,920
No.

417
00:44:26,900 - > 00:44:30,300
How likely is it
that they have a bomb on board?

418
00:44:30,420 - > 00:44:33,700
I do not believe it.
They came by the check.

419
00:44:33,820 - > 00:44:37,140
A plane can survive a bomb ,
provided that in the right place .

420
00:44:40,380 - > 00:44:43,180
Did you call the authorities ?
- Yes, they're here ...

421
00:44:43,260 - > 00:44:45,660
They seem nothing
your plane to know .

422
00:44:46,220 - > 00:44:47,620
We're going to do something.

423
00:44:48,540 - > 00:44:50,460
We are planning something together .

424
00:44:50,740 - > 00:44:52,660
Who helps you ?

425
00:44:52,900 - > 00:44:53,820
People .

426
00:44:56,540 - > 00:44:58,740
Do not worry,
I'll call you back .

427
00:45:18,540 - > 00:45:20,460
Is everyone okay?

428
00:45:23,380 - > 00:45:24,500
Okay .

429
00:45:26,020 - > 00:45:29,420
What do you have?
- We take buffetkar .

430
00:45:30,700 - > 00:45:32,900
How wide is the hallway?

431
00:45:32,880 - > 00:45:34,240
18 inches .

432
00:45:34,160 - > 00:45:36,000
And the first class?
- 24 inches .

433
00:45:36,020 - > 00:45:38,780
We have the fire extinguisher
needed from the hallway.

434
00:45:38,900 - > 00:45:40,420
I grab the buffetkar .

435
00:45:40,540 - > 00:45:42,900
This is an aerial
the Pentagon .

436
00:45:42,980 - > 00:45:46,260
You can see the southeast corner
see under the smoke .

437
00:45:46,340 - > 00:45:49,260
This is the third plane
that flew into a building .

438
00:45:49,340 - > 00:45:52,080
Prove all
hijacked commercial flights.

439
00:45:52,380 - > 00:45:55,450
What should we do , John ?

440
00:45:55,700 - > 00:45:57,620
Call the police ?

441
00:45:58,020 - > 00:45:59,820
The police can not fly , Alice .

442
00:45:59,900 - > 00:46:03,650
They flew into the World Trade Center
and now in the Pentagon .

443
00:46:05,460 - > 00:46:08,780
Call John on his cellphone .

444
00:46:09,180 - > 00:46:12,220
Tell him that this suicide
actions , and that they then how ...

445
00:46:12,340 - > 00:46:15,580
also control the
aircraft should have .

446
00:46:15,960 - > 00:46:18,960
Call the police but later ,
tell Mark ...

447
00:46:19,040 - > 00:46:22,840
that they have to get the plane back
say that this is a suicide mission.

448
00:46:27,680 - > 00:46:29,840
The line is busy.

449
00:46:29,960 - > 00:46:31,360
Try again .

450
00:46:32,880 - > 00:46:33,720
Yes.

451
00:46:48,120 - > 00:46:51,210
My wife was hostess
and she told me that a plane ...

452
00:46:51,280 - > 00:46:53,350
can survive if a bomb
on board.

453
00:47:08,000 - > 00:47:10,920
This is Lisa Jefferson ,
supervisor . I understand ...

454
00:47:11,040 - > 00:47:13,160
that your plane
has been hijacked .

455
00:47:13,240 - > 00:47:16,280
Yes, I am Tod Beamer to
aboard United 93 .

456
00:47:16,600 - > 00:47:19,690
We are probably over Ohio .

457
00:47:23,160 - > 00:47:26,520
The hijackers are
in the cockpit .

458
00:47:26,640 - > 00:47:29,520
How many passengers are on board?

459
00:47:29,640 - > 00:47:33,040
About 40.
- The captain and the first officer ?

460
00:47:34,720 - > 00:47:36,960
The captain and the first officer .

461
00:47:37,220 - > 00:47:38,900
I do not know ...

462
00:47:39,740 - > 00:47:41,260
Are you still there .

463
00:47:43,520 - > 00:47:44,520
Tod .

464
00:47:45,920 - > 00:47:49,080
If you think your life
threatened , then ...

465
00:47:49,200 - > 00:47:52,560
put the phone down .
But do not hang up !

466
00:47:52,680 - > 00:47:54,520
No , I'm fine , I can talk .

467
00:47:54,640 - > 00:47:56,360
Do you know what they want ?

468
00:47:56,480 - > 00:47:58,240
Ransom ...
- No, I do not know.

469
00:48:03,300 - > 00:48:04,740
We're going down .

470
00:48:19,840 - > 00:48:21,720
We rise again .

471
00:48:23,560 - > 00:48:25,480
We rise again .

472
00:48:45,720 - > 00:48:47,880
I thought we
would crash.

473
00:48:49,600 - > 00:48:50,680
Are you there?

474
00:48:50,920 - > 00:48:52,120
Yes , I'm here ...

475
00:48:52,200 - > 00:48:54,520
I 'm here as long as
if you need me .

476
00:48:58,120 - > 00:49:00,770
Just a second , okay ?
I'll be back .

477
00:49:14,880 - > 00:49:16,520
Honey, are you there?

478
00:49:16,800 - > 00:49:17,600
Jack .

479
00:49:20,120 - > 00:49:22,000

We are still looking .

757
01:18:13,540 - > 01:18:15,010
We thought he

01:18:14,980 - > 01:18:17,290
but there is nothing .
He probably landed in the forest .

759
01:18:17,420 - > 01:18:19,050
But we have not found anything.

760
01:18:19,120 - > 01:18:21,840
We are talking about a 757 .
A gigantic plane .

... and the terrible thought ,
that the North Tower also collapses.
