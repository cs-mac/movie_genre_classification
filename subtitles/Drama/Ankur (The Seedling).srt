0
00:04:12,677 --> 00:04:17,341
Mother Goddess!
All I want is a child

1
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,518
Surya! Listen

2
00:04:56,354 --> 00:04:57,787
How have you fared, Prasad?

3
00:04:57,989 --> 00:05:00,116
First class

4
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:02,587
And you?

5
00:05:02,794 --> 00:05:04,557
Pass class

6
00:05:04,896 --> 00:05:07,228
Okay, Nawab, we will have
a beer on that

7
00:05:07,298 --> 00:05:08,458
Okay friends, let's go

8
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:13,194
Surya, I hear you are
getting married

9
00:05:13,404 --> 00:05:17,431
That's an old thing. Next month
he is going to be hanged

10
00:05:17,642 --> 00:05:18,973
Next month, man, next month

11
00:05:19,177 --> 00:05:21,611
And the consummation
has to wait, eh?

12
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:25,180
Poor guy! Landed with a child bride
Shut up, you!

13
00:05:25,383 --> 00:05:27,214
How many sacks did you bring,
Kaushalya?

14
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,582
Twelve

15
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,154
The crop has been good from
your fields

16
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:36,886
Our Pratap works very hard
He takes after you

17
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:39,291
Hard work is good, Kaushalya

18
00:05:39,564 --> 00:05:44,228
Don't forget,
I gave you the best land

19
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,735
That's true

20
00:05:45,903 --> 00:05:50,465
Father, if you provide a well,
it would mean two crops

21
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:54,200
Surya, my son. I have not
seen you for ages

22
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:56,404
How are you my son?

23
00:05:57,115 --> 00:05:59,413
Pratap, greet your brother

24
00:05:59,584 --> 00:06:00,414
Hello

25
00:06:00,585 --> 00:06:02,553
Did you get through your exams?

26
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,483
Yes, father. I passed

27
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:09,922
Third class, I'm sure. Go tell
your mother this good news

28
00:06:12,797 --> 00:06:16,631
He always snubs at me

29
00:06:17,201 --> 00:06:19,761
He's a spoilt brat
His head is full of nonsense

30
00:06:20,872 --> 00:06:23,636
That mother and son,
why have they come here?

31
00:06:23,808 --> 00:06:26,208
They've heard of your marriage

32
00:06:26,377 --> 00:06:29,778
What have they got to do
with my marriage?

33
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:36,446
She wants to hold her son's
marriage with yours

34
00:06:36,654 --> 00:06:39,851
Why do you allow them to come?

35
00:06:40,058 --> 00:06:44,051
She has been your father's mistress
for twenty years

36
00:06:44,228 --> 00:06:46,526
I've suffered that in silence

37
00:06:46,898 --> 00:06:52,063
Your father will do only
what he wants

38
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,461
Whenever I see that woman
I want to...

39
00:06:55,673 --> 00:06:58,107
Don't let your father hear it

40
00:06:58,443 --> 00:07:02,743
And listen to me, never speak
ill about your father

41
00:07:02,947 --> 00:07:06,348
Anyway, what about your results?

42
00:07:06,517 --> 00:07:09,543
I forgot to tell you. I've passed

43
00:07:10,588 --> 00:07:13,614
Now tell father
I want to do my B.A.

44
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:16,724
Surya wants to study further

45
00:07:17,495 --> 00:07:18,689
He is an idiot!

46
00:07:19,364 --> 00:07:21,855
He is fond of studying

47
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:31,938
He is fond of loafing about town
with his friends

48
00:07:33,978 --> 00:07:37,175
How he has passed, I know it

49
00:07:37,982 --> 00:07:42,681
Tell him I won't allow him to
waste any more time

50
00:07:42,854 --> 00:07:44,981
Just tell him to do as I say

51
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:03,930
Your mother says you don't
want to go to the farm?

52
00:09:04,135 --> 00:09:11,541
If you go to college,
who will care for the farm

53
00:09:13,244 --> 00:09:16,611
You could hire some farm-hands

54
00:09:16,781 --> 00:09:21,343
So that they get rich at our cost
and lay claim to the land?

55
00:09:23,054 --> 00:09:29,050
I don't like farming
I'd rather do my B.A.

56
00:09:29,293 --> 00:09:33,161
And become a clerk?

57
00:09:33,331 --> 00:09:39,395
When you can be king
caring over your own land?

58
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,371
All graduates don't remain clerks

59
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,305
No! They end up as Ministers!

60
00:09:44,675 --> 00:09:48,543
Stop this rubbish about college

61
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:52,774
I got to think about your
welfare and,

62
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:56,408
...can't allow you to hang around
those guys

63
00:09:56,621 --> 00:10:01,058
Now you are married...
face your responsibilities

64
00:10:54,579 --> 00:11:00,347
This is Betelpur... nowhere near
as good as before

65
00:11:00,551 --> 00:11:06,183
Neither are the times

66
00:11:14,865 --> 00:11:17,333
Whose raule-trap is that?

67
00:11:17,501 --> 00:11:23,872
Better run, Patel Sahib. It's the
landlord's son -O. K

68
00:11:28,946 --> 00:11:31,414
There goes the sucker!

69
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,545
My greetings to the young master

70
00:11:37,755 --> 00:11:41,851
Looks like the wheels have
jammed in the mud

71
00:11:42,593 --> 00:11:44,117
I'll get you out of this
in a jiffy!

72
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:49,362
Krishna! Kalu!
Come on here, kids

73
00:11:50,735 --> 00:11:58,267
Rehman, bring that
chicken thief Dawood with you

74
00:11:59,744 --> 00:12:02,178
Will come out in 2 minutes, sir

75
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,073
Don't just stand there gawking
C'mon give a hand

76
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:13,915
You don't know me, Master. I'm the
police Patel Sheikh Chand

77
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:18,528
I oversee your father's property

78
00:12:19,263 --> 00:12:22,460
I apologise for not attending
your wedding

79
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:26,068
My wife was ill at the time

80
00:12:26,237 --> 00:12:31,106
Push! No strength. Rehman? Two
marriages have seen to that

81
00:12:31,308 --> 00:12:33,469
Don't marry again, for God's sake

82
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:41,279
Carry on at your leisure, Sir
I will follow

83
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,388
Damdamdora greetings

84
00:14:30,628 --> 00:14:33,062
Please sit inside, Sir
I'll fetch your luggage

85
00:15:01,325 --> 00:15:03,054
Whose clothes are these?

86
00:15:06,263 --> 00:15:08,561
Careful!

87
00:15:09,466 --> 00:15:11,263
Can't you hear?

88
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,670
Are you deaf? Why don't you answer?

89
00:15:21,111 --> 00:15:23,238
Your husband?

90
00:15:23,447 --> 00:15:25,745
Yes, Sir

91
00:15:27,451 --> 00:15:28,975
What does he do?

92
00:15:29,153 --> 00:15:32,645
Nothing much... just odd jobs

93
00:15:34,124 --> 00:15:35,682
And you?

94
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,292
I clean the house

95
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:45,662
Who stays here?

96
00:15:45,836 --> 00:15:48,134
No one

97
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,607
And you?

98
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:01,649
In that hut, near the trees

99
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,658
How long have you worked here?

100
00:16:11,729 --> 00:16:13,560
Just a while, Sir

101
00:16:20,304 --> 00:16:22,101
Who else stays around here?

102
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:27,506
The farm-hands, Sir. Their huts are
behind the fields

103
00:16:27,645 --> 00:16:29,135
Where is the well?

104
00:16:29,313 --> 00:16:31,645
At the back. Not far from here

105
00:16:31,849 --> 00:16:33,714
Would take me to it?

106
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,706
Do these women always collect
water from here?

107
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:03,972
Sometimes, Sir

108
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,886
Not any more. Tell them
Not any more, tell them

109
00:17:15,192 --> 00:17:19,652
Master forbids to take water
from here. Not take water

110
00:18:10,581 --> 00:18:13,175
You take care of the estate?

111
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,582
Yes, Sir

112
00:18:15,686 --> 00:18:17,051
This is how you do it?

113
00:18:17,154 --> 00:18:18,451
I don't understand

114
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:23,356
Look at this house, it's like
a garbage heap

115
00:18:27,498 --> 00:18:32,697
I'm only a poor overseer, and don't
know nothing much about these matters

116
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,667
The villagers misbehave no ends
There is chaos in village

117
00:18:34,872 --> 00:18:37,898
Your father has not been here
for over two years...

118
00:18:37,975 --> 00:18:40,739
...busy as he is with court cases

119
00:18:44,948 --> 00:18:48,281
Who is in charge of the
today tapping?

120
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:56,283
No one. These days we get so little

121
00:18:56,493 --> 00:18:59,257
Even so, who drinks it?

122
00:18:59,463 --> 00:19:03,263
The villagers are all thieves

123
00:19:03,467 --> 00:19:07,927
But now you are here,
matters will improve

124
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,164
Yeah, they better

125
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,265
As would be your command

126
00:19:22,352 --> 00:19:24,513
With your permission, Sir,
I'll take my leave

127
00:19:25,155 --> 00:19:26,747
My respects to you, sir

128
00:19:30,861 --> 00:19:35,855
Shall I ask the village priest to
bring your dinner here?

129
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,567
It's not necessary

130
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,034
Then may I go home?

131
00:19:40,737 --> 00:19:42,398
Yeah, you may

132
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:10,292
What's your name?

133
00:21:11,128 --> 00:21:12,425
Lakshmi

134
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,388
Go, make some tea

135
00:21:16,266 --> 00:21:19,861
Sir, you will drink tea made by me?

136
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,369
Why not?

137
00:21:28,478 --> 00:21:31,538
We are potters, Sir

138
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,681
So what?

139
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,646
The village priest will disapprove

140
00:21:38,855 --> 00:21:43,155
I don't believe in caste
Get the tea

141
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,304
Good morning, Sir

142
00:22:26,069 --> 00:22:27,263
Master, tea is here

143
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,944
Why is your husband here?

144
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:40,039
Sir, I brought him
To ask you for work

145
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:45,384
He was a good potter, Sir

146
00:22:46,356 --> 00:22:53,853
But now people don't like clay
They use aluminium vessels

147
00:22:54,731 --> 00:22:57,063
All the potters are starving

148
00:22:58,101 --> 00:23:00,126
What can he do?

149
00:23:01,638 --> 00:23:08,806
Poor man, he's a deaf-mute

150
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,413
Can he drive the bullock-cart?

151
00:23:12,582 --> 00:23:16,882
Why not, Sir? Of course he can

152
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:20,316
Let him do it then

153
00:24:21,618 --> 00:24:23,483
Lakshmi -Yes, Sir

154
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,516
Whose pump is this?

155
00:24:25,722 --> 00:24:26,620
Yours, Sir

156
00:24:27,691 --> 00:24:29,750
Who uses the water?

157
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,393
Your relatives

158
00:24:31,561 --> 00:24:33,927
I don't have any here

159
00:24:34,464 --> 00:24:37,661
Don't you know, Sir?
The adjacent fields are theirs

160
00:24:37,901 --> 00:24:38,959
Whose?

161
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:42,100
Pratap raja and his mother

162
00:24:52,849 --> 00:24:55,841
Where does this water lead to?
To your brother's field

163
00:24:56,019 --> 00:24:58,817
Change its course, you idiot!

164
00:24:59,022 --> 00:25:01,616
This way... this way!

165
00:25:17,841 --> 00:25:20,810
What are you doing, son? Why did
you have the water stopped?

166
00:25:21,011 --> 00:25:22,672
I am not your son

167
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,281
I think of you that way

168
00:25:25,515 --> 00:25:29,042
Don't push your luck

169
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:33,478
Your land can't get water
when our needs it

170
00:25:33,757 --> 00:25:39,787
What is this, 'yours and ours'
Pratap is your younger brother

171
00:25:40,363 --> 00:25:44,561
Once and for all,
I am nobody's brother

172
00:25:44,801 --> 00:25:47,929
You may get the water only if
I can spare it

173
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:52,267
Don't dare take it without
my permission

174
00:25:52,943 --> 00:25:57,312
He's giving orders already!
- What did you say?

175
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:01,678
Be thankful, I am stopping
the water for only a while

176
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:05,151
Or your tears may have to
water the land

177
00:26:05,322 --> 00:26:11,158
Dear God! What have I done to hear
such words from a mere boy

178
00:26:25,108 --> 00:26:31,843
So many trees, how come the toddy
collection is so poor?

179
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:38,080
From now on, the toddy will be
sold from my house

180
00:26:38,522 --> 00:26:42,049
Yes, Sir, but what about
the thieves?

181
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:44,125
That's your responsibility
You ought to do something, too

182
00:26:44,327 --> 00:26:48,923
Sir, give the word! I'll catch
these mother-fuckers...

183
00:26:49,132 --> 00:26:52,033
...have their heads shaved,
and their faces smeared...

184
00:26:52,102 --> 00:26:54,764
...then parade them on a donkey

185
00:26:54,838 --> 00:26:58,604
The shame of it will make them
leave the village,

186
00:26:58,808 --> 00:27:03,142
Or never steal again
It will be a real lesson

187
00:27:03,313 --> 00:27:07,977
As you like, but mind the toddy

188
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:14,448
Just you see, Sir. You have
Sheikh Chand's word for it

189
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,610
Greetings, young master
- Greetings

190
00:28:14,618 --> 00:28:16,051
Welcome, priest

191
00:28:16,252 --> 00:28:18,311
You have not been here
for a long time

192
00:28:18,521 --> 00:28:22,321
I was upset that you had not
ordered food from me

193
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,790
I'll have the food sent for you

194
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:30,257
All the same, what's the
real reason for your visit?

195
00:28:30,433 --> 00:28:33,891
What reason could I have?
You see...

196
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:40,067
I only work for the good
of religion

197
00:28:40,243 --> 00:28:42,939
Festival of Krishna is here

198
00:28:43,146 --> 00:28:44,579
I've come for a donation

199
00:28:45,048 --> 00:28:49,280
Your father always relished
the food from my house

200
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,020
How much should I give?

201
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:57,983
It's never too much when you
give to God

202
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:02,290
Nobody cares for religion
these days

203
00:29:02,499 --> 00:29:10,338
The villagers rather spend on
drink and gambling

204
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:15,204
Here is ten rupees

205
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:19,815
It's unclean to give with your
left hand. Use your right, Sir.

206
00:29:21,518 --> 00:29:23,418
Thank you. Many thanks

207
00:29:27,757 --> 00:29:32,057
Meet you at the Festival, then

208
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:36,555
Have I bored you with my talk?

209
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:41,170
Shall I send your dinner tonight?

210
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:44,695
No. Some other time maybe

211
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:15,681
Drunk again! No food. No clothes
But you must drink

212
00:33:15,852 --> 00:33:20,221
While I have to steal a little
from here and there

213
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:24,226
You've no shame. What if we
don't have a child!

214
00:33:24,394 --> 00:33:26,954
Must you kill yourself
drinking toddy?

215
00:33:27,063 --> 00:33:32,524
If the Master knew, he would
kick you out, you swine!

216
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:29,481
Whose cattle are these?

217
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,254
Lakshmi O Lakshmi

218
00:34:34,297 --> 00:34:36,959
See, whose cattle are in our field

219
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:48,696
Brother, we would be grateful
if you restore the water

220
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:50,337
Our crops are dying

221
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:55,566
I've said once and for all. You get
water only if we can spare it

222
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:59,904
Mother says we were always allowed
this privillege

223
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:02,779
What is given can be taken away
as well

224
00:36:02,985 --> 00:36:07,285
Why not dig a well of your own?
I can't help you

225
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:11,757
I will have to report this
to father

226
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:21,660
Oh yeah! "Talk to father" The idiot
Who is he trying to scare?

227
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,638
Whose cattle was it?

228
00:36:29,745 --> 00:36:31,576
The village priest's

229
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:34,673
Tell him, the next time
I'll break their legs

230
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:37,752
...and they will be padlocked

231
00:36:38,454 --> 00:36:43,824
Tell your husband to get some
fertiliser from my father

232
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:48,953
Bring what, Sir, compost?

233
00:36:49,365 --> 00:36:52,926
Wait. I'll write it out

234
00:38:56,025 --> 00:38:57,856
Are you crying?

235
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:02,520
Me? No, why should I cry!

236
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:05,494
I thought you were

237
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,833
Do you want something, Sir?

238
00:39:11,607 --> 00:39:14,542
No, No. I...

239
00:39:16,445 --> 00:39:18,106
What's the matter, Sir?

240
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,516
Nothing, nothing

241
00:40:19,942 --> 00:40:22,740
Lakshmi, Lakshmi

242
00:40:33,589 --> 00:40:34,988
Lakshmi!

243
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:24,236
Is this modernity - to deny water
to a brother's farm?

244
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:30,640
Government is doing away with "Land
Ownerships", but habits die hard

245
00:41:31,514 --> 00:41:34,074
I believe you were hauled up
as well?

246
00:41:35,418 --> 00:41:44,019
Well, if the upstart can mistreat
his own folk, why spare me?

247
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:50,827
A few books and their heads
get turned

248
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,730
No thought for elders or the poor

249
00:41:54,036 --> 00:41:57,733
I say, the end of the world is near
God know what the world's coming to

250
00:41:57,907 --> 00:41:59,704
Can I have two bundles of beedi

251
00:42:01,243 --> 00:42:06,374
I hear he eats food cooked
by the potter's wife?

252
00:42:06,582 --> 00:42:13,920
God knows what else
he does with her

253
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:19,757
I tell you, the end of the world
is here

254
00:42:20,763 --> 00:42:23,493
Come on, give me some dal

255
00:42:23,699 --> 00:42:26,031
I have only chick-peas

256
00:42:26,202 --> 00:42:31,936
Okay. Mother-fucking relations are
up only at meal times!

257
00:42:33,642 --> 00:42:41,344
Surya is just a kid. She should
not forget caste rules

258
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:47,653
Leave it. Leave it all to Allah!

259
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:59,523
I'm taking some betel-leaves

260
00:45:02,091 --> 00:45:04,582
You won't give up drinking!

261
00:45:04,793 --> 00:45:10,595
You'll destroy yourself and me. But
drinking you won't give up

262
00:45:16,205 --> 00:45:20,904
Stop staring! You'll drag us both
into the mud one day

263
00:47:08,417 --> 00:47:10,977
He was stealing

264
00:47:11,153 --> 00:47:13,587
Kishtayya

265
00:47:48,557 --> 00:47:55,725
I give your husband a job -
the bastard steals from me?

266
00:47:57,166 --> 00:48:01,500
Thief! Ungrateful wretch!

267
00:48:01,703 --> 00:48:05,935
Please don't punish him
He won't do it again

268
00:48:06,141 --> 00:48:09,838
If he does, beat me
but leave him be

269
00:48:10,045 --> 00:48:15,677
He is guilty. Call the police patel

270
00:50:14,002 --> 00:50:19,338
Eat! Don't ever drink toddy again

271
00:50:24,246 --> 00:50:29,206
What did you gain by letting
me down in front of master?

272
00:50:29,384 --> 00:50:32,547
Did my mother give me to you
for this?

273
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:37,091
Why must you ruin my life!

274
00:51:49,698 --> 00:51:51,996
Where's your husband?

275
00:51:53,335 --> 00:51:55,269
When will he come?

276
00:51:55,437 --> 00:51:56,870
I don't know

277
00:51:57,506 --> 00:52:02,443
How can you not know?
He couldn't have run away

278
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:35,979
Lakshmi refuses to come, Sir

279
00:56:36,318 --> 00:56:38,047
Why?

280
00:56:38,253 --> 00:56:39,447
I don't know

281
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:31,801
Why haven't you come to work?

282
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:35,739
Who will make the tea?

283
00:57:36,811 --> 00:57:38,745
Cook the food?

284
00:57:41,015 --> 00:57:43,643
Clean the house?

285
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:49,355
Do come tomorrow

286
00:58:30,698 --> 00:58:32,325
Your tea, Sir

287
01:00:07,328 --> 01:00:10,195
Leave me! I won't go back to him

288
01:00:10,365 --> 01:00:11,889
Come on!

289
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:13,829
No! I won't go

290
01:00:14,035 --> 01:00:19,564
We'll drag you there
No, I won't go

291
01:00:24,445 --> 01:00:27,437
Come on, you bitch

292
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:34,313
Shameless whore! We'll see
what the village court says

293
01:00:34,956 --> 01:00:39,859
You dare dishonour our brother?
Dare to live with another man

294
01:00:40,395 --> 01:00:41,726
Leave me alone

295
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:45,094
You disgrace yourself and
ask to be left alone

296
01:00:45,333 --> 01:00:47,267
We'll break all your bones

297
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:54,273
You wretch, let the villagers
make decision

298
01:00:54,909 --> 01:00:58,242
Let's see how she won't live

299
01:00:58,713 --> 01:01:01,011
Let me go. Leave me alone

300
01:01:02,116 --> 01:01:07,281
Silence! The village court
stands for justice

301
01:01:08,156 --> 01:01:11,523
Yadgiri, what has your wife done?

302
01:01:15,897 --> 01:01:18,331
First: She deserted her home

303
01:01:18,533 --> 01:01:21,969
Second: She left her husband for
a man from another village

304
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:27,369
She broke all caste laws
Disgraced our brother, the whore

305
01:01:27,542 --> 01:01:33,003
What did she lack, the bitch!
Why so silent?

306
01:01:33,915 --> 01:01:39,182
We three brothers have two farms,
two wells, two crops a year

307
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,754
What more did the bitch need!

308
01:01:41,923 --> 01:01:43,891
Hey, watch your mouth

309
01:01:44,125 --> 01:01:49,995
We are the judges
Leave questions to me

310
01:01:51,566 --> 01:01:57,527
Daughter, what is your grievance
Speak

311
01:01:58,806 --> 01:02:04,210
Don't be afraid. Do you want to be
with your husband?

312
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:09,510
Don't be scared -What?
Why don't you speak up?

313
01:02:10,018 --> 01:02:14,717
Answer. By living in the home
of another caste,

314
01:02:14,922 --> 01:02:18,619
you have disgraced your family,
your house, your village

315
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:23,255
Speak. What is wrong
with your husband?

316
01:02:26,501 --> 01:02:27,832
My husband!

317
01:02:31,072 --> 01:02:32,767
I want a child

318
01:02:32,974 --> 01:02:34,908
That is God's will

319
01:02:35,076 --> 01:02:39,240
My not having a child is
because of him

320
01:02:39,414 --> 01:02:41,814
Shaming our brother, you slut!

321
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:44,445
Lying to hide your own guilt?

322
01:02:44,652 --> 01:02:47,143
Women like you will ruin the world

323
01:02:47,288 --> 01:02:48,880
Silence Be quiet

324
01:02:49,123 --> 01:02:52,320
Daughter, your husband's respect
is your own

325
01:02:52,527 --> 01:02:56,657
You should not speak ill of him
A husband is like a God

326
01:02:56,864 --> 01:02:58,991
This body was made by God

327
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:02,727
And it's not just hunger that needs
to be satisfied

328
01:03:03,805 --> 01:03:08,174
Yadgiri, what have you to say?

329
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:12,645
Whatever he says. I'd rather die
than live with him

330
01:03:12,847 --> 01:03:15,543
We'll kill you first. You hussy!

331
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:20,653
Quiet, you two! Yadgiri,
what do you want?

332
01:03:21,189 --> 01:03:25,956
I'll go by what you decide

333
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:45,968
The village court decrees she
must return to her husband

334
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:47,513
No!

335
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:55,518
If she finds fault with him,
his brothers must compensate

336
01:03:56,057 --> 01:03:59,458
A woman belongs not to the
man alone, but to the house,

337
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:01,924
...to the family and to the caste

338
01:05:27,815 --> 01:05:29,077
What happened?

339
01:05:32,153 --> 01:05:34,053
Why are you sad?

340
01:05:35,923 --> 01:05:40,951
Speak up. What is it, Lakshmi?

341
01:05:45,766 --> 01:05:48,530
I want to go back to my husband

342
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:52,137
Do you know where he is?

343
01:05:57,211 --> 01:05:59,941
No, I don't know where the swine is

344
01:06:00,014 --> 01:06:02,915
Why bother about him then?

345
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:06,076
He has left you,
that drunken deaf-mute...

346
01:06:06,454 --> 01:06:15,920
...who know if or not he'll return
Please, don't talk ill of him

347
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:23,400
His only fault is drinking

348
01:06:26,374 --> 01:06:28,239
All right, I won't say anything

349
01:06:31,879 --> 01:06:34,313
But, don't worry

350
01:06:36,851 --> 01:06:39,183
I'll take care of you

351
01:06:48,596 --> 01:06:50,564
You, Sir?

352
01:06:53,601 --> 01:06:55,159
For how long?

353
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:04,104
How long? Forever

354
01:07:18,125 --> 01:07:22,118
"This is she, the one for whom
lovers gave their lives"

355
01:07:22,263 --> 01:07:29,260
"For whom Farhad died, Majnu
wandered, Romeo killed himself"

356
01:07:30,071 --> 01:07:34,337
"You may call it a joke but
it's the truth"

357
01:07:34,508 --> 01:07:38,308
"See carefully. This is she,
the one for whom lovers died"

358
01:07:53,594 --> 01:07:57,826
Lakshmi, you look like
an angel today

359
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:00,299
Like what, Sir?

360
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:02,268
A fairy

361
01:08:02,403 --> 01:08:04,530
Have you ever seen a film?

362
01:08:04,739 --> 01:08:06,570
Yes, that film "Bal Nagamma"

363
01:08:06,774 --> 01:08:09,572
You look like a film star today

364
01:08:10,444 --> 01:08:12,036
Like what, Sir?

365
01:08:12,913 --> 01:08:20,376
You know, heroines in films
who sing, dance, make love

366
01:08:55,289 --> 01:08:57,553
Why don't you live here now?

367
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:05,691
What will people say?

368
01:09:09,570 --> 01:09:11,663
Who cares?

369
01:09:17,912 --> 01:09:22,781
What if Master comes?

370
01:09:32,226 --> 01:09:34,387
Father? He won't come here

371
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,696
And my husband?

372
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:48,936
You're a fool, Lakshmi. He will
never come back, the swine

373
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:52,442
No, Sir, don't say anything
against him -Okay

374
01:09:56,717 --> 01:09:58,116
Come here

375
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:16,659
Do you like him a lot?

376
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:25,645
Why talk of him. What will happen
when your wife arrives?

377
01:10:35,656 --> 01:10:38,819
My wife is still too young

378
01:10:39,693 --> 01:10:43,720
She will come of age soon
What then?

379
01:10:48,769 --> 01:10:54,969
Nothing. It won't make
a difference to you

380
01:11:04,919 --> 01:11:07,581
Tell me something about yourself

381
01:11:13,594 --> 01:11:15,186
What shall I say?

382
01:11:16,030 --> 01:11:19,557
How did you get married
to such a man?

383
01:11:20,434 --> 01:11:23,164
The same way that
everybody gets married

384
01:11:23,337 --> 01:11:26,636
Still... tell me, how did it happen

385
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:38,507
My mother was widowed
when I was quite small

386
01:11:38,686 --> 01:11:44,591
Kishtayya took care of us
He was young then. A good potter

387
01:11:44,758 --> 01:11:49,218
I was just about a kid and
I've been working since then

388
01:11:50,664 --> 01:11:54,191
But how does all this concern
aristocrats like you?

389
01:11:54,401 --> 01:11:57,495
You people have different living
styles, and we've our own

390
01:11:58,639 --> 01:12:02,803
I want to know. Tell me

391
01:12:03,777 --> 01:12:07,304
My mother was worried,
so she married me off

392
01:12:07,481 --> 01:12:12,680
Was there no other man except
a drunken deaf-mute?

393
01:12:14,989 --> 01:12:20,985
Lots of men, but who would marry me?
I had no dowry

394
01:12:21,829 --> 01:12:28,166
And Kishtayya then was a strong man,
a fine person

395
01:12:29,403 --> 01:12:32,463
Being jobless has made him
take to drink

396
01:12:32,806 --> 01:12:35,172
Otherwise he is a good man, sir

397
01:12:42,116 --> 01:12:44,550
Why have you no children?

398
01:12:51,492 --> 01:12:56,486
I am unlucky. It's not in my fate

399
01:12:57,131 --> 01:13:01,727
Is Kishtayya lacking as a man?

400
01:13:09,243 --> 01:13:12,940
Don't you dare say that again!

401
01:13:14,181 --> 01:13:19,175
My husband is a real man
Perhaps the fault is with me

402
01:13:20,054 --> 01:13:22,488
I've betrayed him

403
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:29,219
You may not respect me. Does that
mean you can insult him?

404
01:13:55,789 --> 01:13:58,121
Happy Diwali, Surya Babu

405
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:04,592
What's this, playing with crackers?
Diwali calls for an adult game

406
01:14:04,765 --> 01:14:11,572
Today we worship the Goddess of
wealth. Win or lose!

407
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:15,133
I don't play cards

408
01:14:17,544 --> 01:14:20,877
Lakshmi! Bring some
sherbet and sweets

409
01:14:21,048 --> 01:14:26,213
What? Today the bottle must rule
- Very well then

410
01:14:26,387 --> 01:14:35,352
Lakshmi, spread the rug and
bring four glasses

411
01:14:37,398 --> 01:14:43,337
Once a year, the bottle and dice
join hands. Let's go!

412
01:14:44,104 --> 01:14:48,734
Look, you play. I'll watch

413
01:14:49,576 --> 01:14:54,104
Listen, only eunuchs be
the spectators

414
01:16:05,352 --> 01:16:09,880
Lost this round, too
Now my pockets are empty

415
01:16:10,157 --> 01:16:11,590
Swami, you better leave

416
01:16:12,593 --> 01:16:19,795
Bankrupt or no, I will not get up
It's a man's word

417
01:16:20,868 --> 01:16:23,098
Here, I bet this on the king

418
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:38,442
Swami, you've lost again

419
01:16:43,023 --> 01:16:46,550
Now get up, Swami, you've lost
your watch as well

420
01:16:46,793 --> 01:16:49,489
What? Even you say that to Swami?

421
01:16:53,967 --> 01:16:57,926
Here, my gold chain

422
01:16:58,171 --> 01:17:01,038
Place it on my behalf. It's no less
than two taels

423
01:17:01,241 --> 01:17:05,268
Swami, the Goddess of wealth
is on my side. You'll lose

424
01:17:05,445 --> 01:17:07,413
Yeah, I know

425
01:17:07,614 --> 01:17:13,553
Put all your winnings on this round
Then we'll see! On the Queen

426
01:17:13,754 --> 01:17:16,587
Here's the watch and the money
You distribute the cards

427
01:17:16,757 --> 01:17:21,922
On the Queen. Come my queen

428
01:17:27,401 --> 01:17:30,268
Look, Swami. It's the queen, I won

429
01:17:36,143 --> 01:17:40,580
Go now or you'll bet the shirt
off your back

430
01:17:40,781 --> 01:17:42,248
Get up, Swami. Go

431
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:44,417
What did you say? - Get up

432
01:17:44,751 --> 01:17:46,685
You told me to get up!

433
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:56,722
I am Swami - son of a real man!
Understand? Deal

434
01:17:58,332 --> 01:18:03,167
What will you bet with?
You've lost everything

435
01:18:05,405 --> 01:18:09,466
Deal. I bet my wife

436
01:18:11,178 --> 01:18:17,777
He's very drunk. Make him go

437
01:18:19,886 --> 01:18:27,054
Sir, a man's word, my wife. Deal!

438
01:18:27,494 --> 01:18:31,123
You distribute the cards
I've bet my wife

439
01:18:31,565 --> 01:18:34,363
This is so ridiculous, Swami

440
01:18:34,568 --> 01:18:37,731
You've even bet your wife!
Yeah, so what

441
01:18:38,038 --> 01:18:41,064
If you lose, I'll come to
fetch her tomorrow

442
01:18:41,274 --> 01:18:42,935
Yes, yes, take her away

443
01:18:43,243 --> 01:18:45,643
Yeah sure, I'm a man

444
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:49,415
Swami, I'll come to your house
to take your wife

445
01:18:49,616 --> 01:18:54,849
Yes man, take her
I'm a man of word

446
01:18:56,023 --> 01:19:01,188
Okay, Swami, I'm a man too. This
desire of yours I will fulfill

447
01:19:19,346 --> 01:19:25,910
Look, Swami, you've lost. Tomorrow
I will come to claim her

448
01:19:26,586 --> 01:19:31,023
Yes, sure do. That is
if you are a man

449
01:19:31,591 --> 01:19:38,394
You'd better leave now
It's getting very late

450
01:19:38,932 --> 01:19:43,266
Yeah Swami, I'll be at your place
tomorrow morning to take your wife

451
01:19:43,670 --> 01:19:48,698
Yeah dude, let's decide there and
then who is a man who is not

452
01:19:48,909 --> 01:19:53,608
Is that so? It's a deal then. We'll
sure decide who is a real man

453
01:19:54,314 --> 01:19:57,408
Yeah come -I sure will

454
01:22:08,615 --> 01:22:11,015
What bird is that?

455
01:22:12,619 --> 01:22:16,749
Here we call it "Vadla Pitta", Sir

456
01:22:23,169 --> 01:22:27,196
I'm not lying, Swami. I've come to
take your wife

457
01:22:27,406 --> 01:22:31,035
But I was drunk
Why take it so seriously?

458
01:22:31,210 --> 01:22:33,940
A man's word
It goes for both of us

459
01:22:34,113 --> 01:22:37,913
This was last night...
- So call your wife

460
01:22:38,117 --> 01:22:40,381
Who is this loud-mouth?

461
01:22:40,686 --> 01:22:47,182
Accusing me? He lost you to me
at cards yesterday

462
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:54,996
He dares! Lost me, did he, the so-
and-so... who's he to bet me?

463
01:23:00,573 --> 01:23:02,700
Who are you to win me, anyway?

464
01:23:02,908 --> 01:23:06,969
Shameless creature, haven't you
a wife at home?

465
01:23:07,179 --> 01:23:11,513
Someone might come and win her
You take care of your wife first

466
01:23:12,117 --> 01:23:16,781
I tried to tell him,
but he wouldn't listen

467
01:23:17,356 --> 01:23:21,759
Get out! And you, trying to be
the mythical King of Truth

468
01:23:21,961 --> 01:23:25,658
Come inside. I'll show you
the real Battle

469
01:23:33,639 --> 01:23:35,971
What's this I am listening?

470
01:23:38,344 --> 01:23:41,142
The whole village is spitting
shame on you

471
01:23:41,213 --> 01:23:42,271
What have I done?

472
01:23:42,448 --> 01:23:45,884
What haven't you done? You've done
countless shameless feats

473
01:23:46,085 --> 01:23:49,612
Who told you to deny water to
Kaushalya' s fields?

474
01:23:50,155 --> 01:23:55,115
There wasn't enough for us
We have 50 extra acres now

475
01:23:55,361 --> 01:23:58,262
The crop would suffer
You'd be angry anyway

476
01:23:58,430 --> 01:24:01,593
It's the time for ploughing, right?
Not for sowing

477
01:24:01,767 --> 01:24:05,134
Big mouth! Come down to earth

478
01:24:05,638 --> 01:24:11,599
Where is that woman who lives here?
I would like to see her

479
01:24:12,111 --> 01:24:13,772
Who are you talking about?

480
01:24:13,946 --> 01:24:16,710
The low-caste wench
who cooks your meals

481
01:24:16,882 --> 01:24:19,783
Is there poison in the
priest's food?

482
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:22,346
Father, she too is a human being

483
01:24:22,555 --> 01:24:30,155
You got more cheeky by the day
I hear she sleeps with you?

484
01:24:30,829 --> 01:24:33,297
Father, you tend to be over...

485
01:24:33,365 --> 01:24:36,232
Suspicious
Your mother says the same

486
01:24:36,402 --> 01:24:48,337
Well, do what you will. But
have some sense of dignity

487
01:24:50,282 --> 01:24:54,844
How will you behave when I'm dead?

488
01:24:55,554 --> 01:24:59,149
If I chose to, I could kick her
out of the village

489
01:24:59,358 --> 01:25:03,294
Within a society, you must learn
to live by its rules

490
01:25:04,263 --> 01:25:11,135
Quiet! What will your in-laws say?
There's still time. Improve yourself

491
01:25:12,171 --> 01:25:19,839
And your wife? She will be here
any day now

492
01:25:22,281 --> 01:25:27,048
It's up to you. Safeguard your
property, your status in life

493
01:25:27,219 --> 01:25:31,849
You've to learn to accept
responsibility of your wife

494
01:27:25,070 --> 01:27:28,801
I look odd in this photograph,
don't I?

495
01:28:04,243 --> 01:28:08,839
Saru, come here. Sit down

496
01:28:11,984 --> 01:28:14,111
Okay, all right

497
01:28:16,522 --> 01:28:17,955
Come, sit here

498
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:33,094
Do you like the place?

499
01:28:35,507 --> 01:28:37,771
Does that woman live here?

500
01:28:38,410 --> 01:28:41,709
Yes, she works in the house

501
01:31:17,469 --> 01:31:18,731
Saru

502
01:31:31,984 --> 01:31:36,250
All that land, those fields,
are ours

503
01:31:56,174 --> 01:31:58,074
You will drink the tea?

504
01:31:59,578 --> 01:32:02,547
Why? What's wrong with it?

505
01:32:02,748 --> 01:32:05,148
But she has made it!

506
01:32:06,451 --> 01:32:11,252
What's wrong in that
I don't care about caste

507
01:32:11,857 --> 01:32:14,792
But I will not have anything
she has touched

508
01:32:14,993 --> 01:32:17,086
Saru, what are you saying?

509
01:32:17,295 --> 01:32:20,196
I know what I'm saying

510
01:32:20,399 --> 01:32:23,835
She will no longer cook the food
I'll do that

511
01:32:24,002 --> 01:32:27,233
Don't trouble yourself, Saru

512
01:32:27,439 --> 01:32:30,431
It's no trouble reaaly
I'll tell her right now

513
01:32:49,928 --> 01:32:57,767
Look, don't do the cooking
Just clean the house, okay?

514
01:33:23,528 --> 01:33:32,095
I said, do only the cleaning
I'll make the beds

515
01:33:42,647 --> 01:33:45,514
Why nag her so?

516
01:33:45,717 --> 01:33:52,589
If you don't like her work,
I'll get her another job

517
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:25,957
I don't like her staying here

518
01:34:26,124 --> 01:34:28,388
She creeps about like a cat

519
01:34:28,994 --> 01:34:30,723
What's wrong with her own place?

520
01:34:31,396 --> 01:34:36,493
Her husband has left her
Anyway, where can she go?

521
01:34:36,635 --> 01:34:39,900
Left such a young woman!

522
01:34:41,139 --> 01:34:44,506
Just think, what will people say?

523
01:34:45,443 --> 01:34:49,903
She has been staying here
for some time now

524
01:34:50,081 --> 01:34:55,417
Why? A grown, healthy woman like her
Hasn't she any sense?

525
01:34:57,088 --> 01:35:01,184
Answer me, why does she live here

526
01:35:11,670 --> 01:35:16,664
Don't make so much of it, Saru

527
01:35:22,614 --> 01:35:24,514
I've heard everything

528
01:35:26,785 --> 01:35:28,218
What have you heard?

529
01:35:28,286 --> 01:35:29,981
Nothing at all

530
01:35:30,922 --> 01:35:35,256
Stuff and nonsense!

531
01:35:36,761 --> 01:35:41,221
I don't like her staying here
one bit. I will get rid of her

532
01:35:42,267 --> 01:35:51,869
And then; Who will do the housework,
the washing, the cleaning?

533
01:35:52,911 --> 01:35:54,970
We'll get someone else

534
01:35:57,148 --> 01:36:00,174
As you wish. I don't care

535
01:36:36,955 --> 01:36:41,119
What's wrong? Have you got fever?

536
01:36:44,262 --> 01:36:46,924
You look so pale

537
01:36:50,702 --> 01:36:53,500
Something you've eaten
must have upset you

538
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:26,034
Lakshmi was ill today. She vomitted

539
01:37:27,372 --> 01:37:29,897
What was the matter?

540
01:37:30,508 --> 01:37:34,467
I did ask her about it
She didn't say

541
01:37:34,946 --> 01:37:37,779
Did you give her some medicine?

542
01:37:38,883 --> 01:37:45,186
Why should I? Tell her to go home
if she's ill

543
01:38:12,484 --> 01:38:14,076
Lakshmi

544
01:38:20,825 --> 01:38:23,191
Where were you? - At the market

545
01:38:23,795 --> 01:38:27,390
You're not well?

546
01:38:28,466 --> 01:38:29,933
It's nothing

547
01:38:30,135 --> 01:38:35,630
You don't look well at all
Tell the truth

548
01:38:37,075 --> 01:38:42,342
I'm not sure whether I'm pregnant

549
01:38:43,782 --> 01:38:49,982
But this can't happen!
A child will upset everything

550
01:38:50,155 --> 01:38:51,816
So what am I to do?

551
01:38:52,624 --> 01:38:56,993
Anything, it will create a scandal!

552
01:38:57,996 --> 01:38:59,623
Tell me what to do?

553
01:39:02,734 --> 01:39:05,294
Go away from here

554
01:39:09,674 --> 01:39:10,902
Where to?

555
01:40:06,664 --> 01:40:13,570
Lakshmi, you're too ill to cope
with the work

556
01:40:14,939 --> 01:40:16,998
Go home for a few days

557
01:40:18,776 --> 01:40:19,834
Home?

558
01:40:20,044 --> 01:40:27,712
Or go work in the fields
- But the field-work will be...

559
01:40:27,785 --> 01:40:29,116
What's the matter?

560
01:40:51,476 --> 01:40:52,340
What is it?

561
01:40:52,510 --> 01:40:56,913
Nothing. I was saying she couldn't
manage the work

562
01:40:57,081 --> 01:41:02,109
She should rest a while. In time
she can work in the fields

563
01:42:26,070 --> 01:42:30,666
Lakshmi Lakshmi Lakshmi

564
01:42:39,684 --> 01:42:40,776
Lakshmi

565
01:43:03,374 --> 01:43:06,639
What have you done to get
rid of the child?

566
01:43:09,313 --> 01:43:13,443
Nothing. Nor will I

567
01:43:14,485 --> 01:43:16,578
There must not be a child

568
01:43:25,463 --> 01:43:30,162
I want the child
- I mean, just think

569
01:43:30,835 --> 01:43:35,295
Do you wish to disgrace my
reputation in society?

570
01:43:38,443 --> 01:43:40,536
Do you think it's a joke?

571
01:43:41,546 --> 01:43:44,174
Who will care for the baby?

572
01:43:47,351 --> 01:43:49,615
Did I ask you to?

573
01:43:52,490 --> 01:43:54,720
Won't you feel ashamed?

574
01:43:57,161 --> 01:44:01,291
Is the shame only mine?
What about you?

575
01:44:03,634 --> 01:44:09,573
Don't be stupid! Abort the child
or suffer alone

576
01:44:11,476 --> 01:44:15,572
Because I won't have anything to do
with all this!

577
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:25,580
You better find yourself
another place to stay

578
01:44:26,257 --> 01:44:30,591
O'my heart, let's go someplace else
Let's find another home

579
01:44:39,904 --> 01:44:42,532
Do you have Nimmi's version
of this song?

580
01:44:42,774 --> 01:44:47,541
No, Lata's. Like to hear it?

581
01:44:57,121 --> 01:44:58,315
Wait!

582
01:45:02,093 --> 01:45:04,323
What kind of bird is that?

583
01:45:04,428 --> 01:45:07,090
Here they call it "Vadla Pitta"

584
01:45:44,969 --> 01:45:47,870
Where have you been all this time?

585
01:45:48,072 --> 01:45:49,198
At home

586
01:45:49,373 --> 01:45:51,034
Working somewhere?

587
01:45:52,743 --> 01:45:54,540
I've come to ask for work

588
01:45:54,712 --> 01:45:56,771
We have someone now

589
01:45:58,082 --> 01:45:59,606
I know

590
01:46:00,318 --> 01:46:02,411
Will you eat something?

591
01:46:04,522 --> 01:46:07,423
Come that way. I'll get you a plate

592
01:46:42,159 --> 01:46:44,093
Shameless hussy!

593
01:46:46,264 --> 01:46:49,700
Stealing rice when I've
brought food for you?

594
01:46:49,901 --> 01:46:55,464
You people steal hence you starve
C'mon out with all the rice

595
01:46:56,641 --> 01:46:57,767
What's going on?

596
01:46:57,942 --> 01:47:01,639
I went that way and there
she was stealing rice

597
01:47:01,812 --> 01:47:11,949
Do you know, we whip those who
steal rice till they bleed?

598
01:47:13,658 --> 01:47:17,958
You, too, if you were not a woman

599
01:47:19,096 --> 01:47:23,965
Go! Never show your face here again
Understand?

600
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:47,454
All the corn stolen
The fields are half empty

601
01:47:53,230 --> 01:47:54,993
Who's there?

602
01:48:00,104 --> 01:48:03,073
Hey you there, come on out

603
01:48:10,448 --> 01:48:12,609
Oh, so it's you!

604
01:48:16,654 --> 01:48:18,315
It's you stealing, eh?

605
01:48:18,723 --> 01:48:20,953
I don't understand this

606
01:48:21,125 --> 01:48:24,583
Your health is getting worse
by the day

607
01:48:24,762 --> 01:48:26,662
What's wrong?

608
01:48:27,098 --> 01:48:28,326
God knows

609
01:48:28,866 --> 01:48:35,465
Lakshmi, you can't hide the truth
or worry it away

610
01:48:36,407 --> 01:48:44,337
The young Master will give you
some land. Have your fun!

611
01:48:44,515 --> 01:48:46,142
What did you say?

612
01:48:46,417 --> 01:48:52,583
Didn't his father give land to
Kaushalya and Pratap?

613
01:48:52,790 --> 01:48:56,385
The same will happen to you!

614
01:48:59,296 --> 01:49:01,321
Allah is great!

615
01:49:15,479 --> 01:49:17,276
Greetings, Sir

616
01:49:24,889 --> 01:49:26,481
Why are you here?

617
01:49:26,657 --> 01:49:30,252
I wanted to speak to you, Sir

618
01:49:32,430 --> 01:49:34,159
About what?

619
01:49:39,703 --> 01:49:46,131
Coming from me, it might
seem offensive

620
01:49:46,343 --> 01:49:47,207
Go ahead

621
01:49:48,279 --> 01:49:51,544
You know that woman Lakshmi
- Yeah. So What about her?

622
01:49:51,715 --> 01:49:54,741
You see, Lakshmi will
soon be giving birth

623
01:49:55,386 --> 01:49:57,013
How is that my concern?

624
01:49:57,221 --> 01:50:02,249
You made her leave her job
It was not right, Sir

625
01:50:02,460 --> 01:50:09,457
Who will look after her now?
Please have some consideration

626
01:50:10,634 --> 01:50:11,726
What do you mean?

627
01:50:12,303 --> 01:50:16,433
Look at your father, Sir
He gave of his own will

628
01:50:16,640 --> 01:50:17,902
Kaushalya got...

629
01:50:18,109 --> 01:50:19,838
Don't dare talk of my father

630
01:50:20,044 --> 01:50:22,035
Who will look after Lakshmi?

631
01:50:22,213 --> 01:50:26,547
Who are you to speak for her?
Take care of her yourself

632
01:50:26,750 --> 01:50:30,709
But, Sir, it was under your care
that she came to this

633
01:50:31,188 --> 01:50:33,816
Sheikh Chand, you can go

634
02:00:19,643 --> 02:00:23,409
Mallika! Ramaya! Poohiga! Catch him

635
02:00:56,646 --> 02:01:01,913
You bastard! You've come to
attack me, have you?

636
02:01:14,998 --> 02:01:21,369
You dare! Rascal! Today
you won't be spared

637
02:01:30,213 --> 02:01:32,613
You threaten me?

638
02:01:35,852 --> 02:01:39,982
Ungrateful swine!

639
02:01:50,667 --> 02:01:54,467
I gave you work and you
stole from me!

640
02:01:55,305 --> 02:01:58,172
Bastard! You ran away from here

641
02:01:59,676 --> 02:02:04,375
Now, you show your filthy face?

642
02:02:05,081 --> 02:02:06,912
You want to kill me

643
02:02:07,684 --> 02:02:11,643
You ingrate! I'll show you
your place

644
02:02:13,990 --> 02:02:22,125
You'll remember this day
all your life

645
02:02:38,748 --> 02:02:42,878
You beat him, you bastard!

646
02:02:52,696 --> 02:02:57,133
Poor dumb man, came to plead for
work and you beat him?

647
02:02:57,534 --> 02:03:01,129
You carry guilt on your head
So you're scared to death

648
02:03:01,504 --> 02:03:04,268
May your good fortune rot in mud

649
02:03:04,608 --> 02:03:07,406
You may be a big man in your house

650
02:03:07,911 --> 02:03:10,243
But we are not your slaves

651
02:03:10,580 --> 02:03:14,346
We don't want your work, your money
nothing from you!

652
02:03:14,751 --> 02:03:17,811
Take it all to your grave

653
02:03:19,422 --> 02:03:24,086
God will hit back at you

654
02:03:24,461 --> 02:03:28,261
The curse of the poor is on you

655
02:03:28,431 --> 02:03:30,558
Rot in eternity!
