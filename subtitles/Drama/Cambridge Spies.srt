1
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,176
<i>The next stop is Broad Street.

2
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:47,544
<i>Broad Street will be next.

3
00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:00,484
Upstairs. This way.

4
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:11,428
He didn't come up this way?
Anything?

5
00:05:11,461 --> 00:05:13,230
He's not up here.
Go back down.

6
00:05:15,665 --> 00:05:17,167
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

7
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,488
Go ahead and park
around the corner.

8
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,483
Visitors.

9
00:08:53,516 --> 00:08:54,884
Do you mind
if I fetch my teeth?

10
00:08:54,918 --> 00:08:56,853
Colonel, would you
turn around, please?

11
00:09:00,056 --> 00:09:00,957
Sit down on the bed.

12
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,459
Let's go.

13
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:13,803
Uh, they're in the...
The teeth are in the...
On the sink.

14
00:09:13,837 --> 00:09:15,672
Look at me. We are agents

15
00:09:15,705 --> 00:09:17,807
from the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

16
00:09:17,841 --> 00:09:18,908
Look at me!

17
00:09:18,942 --> 00:09:20,710
I'm talking to you.

18
00:09:20,744 --> 00:09:22,545
We've received information

19
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:24,848
concerning your
involvement in espionage.

20
00:09:24,881 --> 00:09:26,883
You can either cooperate
with us right now,

21
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,518
or you'll be under arrest.

22
00:09:28,551 --> 00:09:29,486
Do you understand, Colonel?

23
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,454
No, not really.

24
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,791
Why do you
keep calling me "Colonel"?

25
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,593
You need
to get dressed.

26
00:09:36,626 --> 00:09:38,661
We have to search
your apartment.

27
00:09:38,695 --> 00:09:42,766
Would you mind if I, uh,
cleaned my palette?

28
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:45,602
The paints,
it'll get ruined otherwise.

29
00:09:45,635 --> 00:09:46,970
It's just behind you there.

30
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:50,940
I have a cloth myself.

31
00:09:50,974 --> 00:09:52,041
Thank you.

32
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:54,811
All right, start searching the place.
Thank you.

33
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:55,979
All right,
search the mattress,

34
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,247
the bed, the floorboards,
his chair.

35
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,549
Would you put that
in the ashtray on the windowsill there?

36
00:09:59,582 --> 00:10:01,117
Take a good look
at that desk.

37
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:06,456
Let's see the desk.

38
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:14,798
Wouldn't want
to get this ruined.

39
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:31,514
<i>Don't say "my guy."

40
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:34,551
<i>He's not "my guy."

41
00:10:34,584 --> 00:10:37,620
Yes, he's "your guy."
Who are we talking about?

42
00:10:37,654 --> 00:10:41,591
We're talking about a guy
who was insured by my client.

43
00:10:41,624 --> 00:10:43,593
So, don't make him "my guy."

44
00:10:44,594 --> 00:10:46,129
Okay, fine.

45
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:49,732
My point is, the guy
insured by your client,

46
00:10:49,766 --> 00:10:52,535
he doesn't deny that
any of these things happened.

47
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:55,104
"These... These things"?

48
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:57,774
Yes,
these five things.

49
00:10:57,807 --> 00:10:59,576
Wait, hold it,
hold it, hold it.

50
00:10:59,609 --> 00:11:00,877
Not five things.

51
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,879
One thing.

52
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,013
Clearly,
it's five things.

53
00:11:04,047 --> 00:11:05,782
Well, I'm sorry,
it's not clear to me.

54
00:11:05,815 --> 00:11:08,618
Five things?
Explain it to me.

55
00:11:08,651 --> 00:11:09,886
It's self-evident.

56
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,788
Okay, then tell me
what happened.

57
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:15,158
Tell me the story in a way
that makes sense for five things.

58
00:11:15,191 --> 00:11:17,594
Fine, absolutely.
Your guy is...

59
00:11:17,627 --> 00:11:18,962
Not my guy.
Insured by my client.

60
00:11:18,995 --> 00:11:20,630
The guy insured
by your client

61
00:11:20,663 --> 00:11:22,131
is driving down
State Highway 19

62
00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:24,767
when he loses control
of his car and hits my five guys,

63
00:11:24,801 --> 00:11:26,903
the five guys who hired me
to represent them

64
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,371
because you're not
honoring your claim.

65
00:11:28,404 --> 00:11:32,108
You mean my client is not
honoring the claim, the insurance company?

66
00:11:32,141 --> 00:11:34,777
Mr. Donovan,
we're all clear on who's who, here.

67
00:11:34,811 --> 00:11:37,614
Except my client
honors every claim.

68
00:11:37,647 --> 00:11:38,748
They do, Mr. Bates.

69
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,116
Every single
legitimate claim,

70
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:41,784
up to the limit
of their liability,

71
00:11:41,818 --> 00:11:43,953
which is $100,000
per accident,

72
00:11:43,987 --> 00:11:46,122
in the case of
this man's policy.

73
00:11:46,155 --> 00:11:47,323
And this is one claim.

74
00:11:47,357 --> 00:11:51,060
According to your description,
"He hit my five guys."

75
00:11:51,094 --> 00:11:54,097
The guy insured by my client
had one accident.

76
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,365
One, one, one.

77
00:11:55,398 --> 00:11:58,935
Losing control of the car and
hitting five motorcyclists.

78
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,170
From their point of view,
five things happened.

79
00:12:02,238 --> 00:12:05,041
Well, look, Bob.
May I? Bob?

80
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:08,144
"Jim."

81
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:10,947
If I go bowling and I throw
a strike, one thing happened.

82
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,048
Ten things didn't happen.

83
00:12:12,081 --> 00:12:14,117
Jim, my guys
aren't bowling pins,

84
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,852
as much as your guy
may have treated them as such.

85
00:12:15,885 --> 00:12:17,186
If... Let me finish.
Let me finish.

86
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,023
If your house
is insured for $100,000

87
00:12:20,056 --> 00:12:22,058
and a tornado
carries it away,

88
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:23,760
it carried away one house.

89
00:12:23,793 --> 00:12:25,228
It didn't pick up
every stick of furniture

90
00:12:25,261 --> 00:12:27,931
and destroy it
in a separate incident.

91
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:30,700
If that is
what you're saying,

92
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:33,970
well, then there is never
any limit to our liability

93
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:37,006
and that is the end
of the insurance business.

94
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,208
And then, Bob,
nobody is safe.

95
00:12:44,914 --> 00:12:47,116
Watters, Cowan and Donovan.
How may I direct your call?

96
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,785
Morning, Mr. Donovan.

97
00:12:48,818 --> 00:12:50,119
Good morning, Alison.

98
00:12:50,153 --> 00:12:52,088
I moved your 9:00 a.m.
with Prudential, sir.

99
00:12:52,121 --> 00:12:53,222
Why did you do that?

100
00:12:53,256 --> 00:12:54,824
I asked her to.

101
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:57,093
Is everything
all right, Tom?

102
00:12:57,126 --> 00:12:59,796
Why don't you leave your stuff with Alison.
Come on inside.

103
00:13:00,964 --> 00:13:02,231
Something pretty important
has come up.

104
00:13:02,265 --> 00:13:04,000
Somebody's here to see us.

105
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,868
Natalie's getting
your coffee.

106
00:13:05,902 --> 00:13:08,671
Nescafe, cream, two lumps,
right?

107
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:09,973
That's right. Thanks.

108
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,242
Lynn!
Jim!

109
00:13:13,276 --> 00:13:15,144
Nice to see you again.
How's the family?

110
00:13:15,178 --> 00:13:16,980
Great, good. Thanks.
How's Annie?

111
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:19,248
Homicidal. We had
the in-laws for the holiday.

112
00:13:19,282 --> 00:13:21,522
Well, if she acts on it,
she'll have good representation.

113
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:23,853
Now, what's up?

114
00:13:30,293 --> 00:13:32,195
Okay, here's the thing.

115
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,732
The Soviet spy they caught,
we want you to defend him.

116
00:13:35,765 --> 00:13:37,033
Here's the indictment.

117
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,237
Wow.

118
00:13:43,106 --> 00:13:44,974
I'm not sure
I wanna pick that up.

119
00:13:45,008 --> 00:13:47,043
The accused
doesn't know any lawyers.

120
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,012
The federal court
tossed it into our lap.

121
00:13:50,313 --> 00:13:52,248
The Bar Committee took a vote.

122
00:13:52,281 --> 00:13:54,083
You're the unanimous choice.

123
00:13:54,117 --> 00:13:55,718
It was important to us...

124
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,053
It's important
to our country, Jim,

125
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,022
that this man is seen
as getting a fair shake.

126
00:13:59,055 --> 00:14:01,057
American justice
will be on trial.

127
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,992
Well, of course,
when you put it that way,

128
00:14:03,026 --> 00:14:04,994
it's an honor to be asked.

129
00:14:05,028 --> 00:14:06,929
But, Lynn,
I'm an insurance lawyer.

130
00:14:06,963 --> 00:14:08,898
I haven't done
criminal work in years.

131
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,933
It's like riding a bike,
isn't it?

132
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:13,036
You distinguished yourself
at Nuremberg.

133
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:14,771
I was on
the prosecution team.

134
00:14:14,804 --> 00:14:16,039
Not the point.

135
00:14:16,072 --> 00:14:17,432
You're no stranger
to criminal law.

136
00:14:18,174 --> 00:14:20,109
Jim, look at the situation.

137
00:14:20,143 --> 00:14:22,178
The man is publicly reviled.

138
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:23,212
And I will be, too.

139
00:14:23,246 --> 00:14:25,081
Yes, in more
ignorant quarters.

140
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,949
But that's exactly why
this has to be done,

141
00:14:26,983 --> 00:14:29,052
and capably done.

142
00:14:29,085 --> 00:14:31,054
It can't look like
our justice system

143
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:32,247
tosses people
on the ash heap.

144
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,063
Suppose I did,
what's the evidence look like?

145
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,832
Pretty overwhelming.

146
00:14:43,332 --> 00:14:45,334
Great. Great.

147
00:14:45,368 --> 00:14:48,004
Everyone will hate me
but at least I'll lose.

148
00:14:50,173 --> 00:14:52,241
Well, what do
you think, Tom?

149
00:14:52,275 --> 00:14:54,944
The firm will suffer.
I have work here.

150
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,013
I think
it's a patriotic duty.

151
00:14:57,046 --> 00:14:59,015
It's an important mission.

152
00:14:59,048 --> 00:15:01,250
I told Lynn,
the firm can't say no,

153
00:15:01,284 --> 00:15:03,352
and you'd have a tough time
saying no, too.

154
00:15:04,954 --> 00:15:07,824
I think you have to defend
the son of a bitch.

155
00:15:07,857 --> 00:15:09,859
So, you're doing it?

156
00:15:09,892 --> 00:15:11,227
Doing what?

157
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,263
Defending Abel,
the Soviet spy.

158
00:15:14,297 --> 00:15:15,598
I may. I have to speak to...

159
00:15:15,631 --> 00:15:18,267
Wait, how do you know?
Did they post it on the bulletin board?

160
00:15:18,301 --> 00:15:20,369
No, I... I was
talking to Richard Earl...

161
00:15:20,403 --> 00:15:22,305
Look, if I do this,
I'm going to need your help.

162
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,110
Can you work tonight?

163
00:15:28,978 --> 00:15:30,218
Well, I have
a dinner date, sir.

164
00:15:34,117 --> 00:15:36,119
It's Tuesday, right?
Yeah, no, I'm free, completely free.

165
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:37,253
Thank you, sir.

166
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,126
But it's also an honor.

167
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:45,261
And the Bar Association
asked me

168
00:15:45,294 --> 00:15:47,063
because they want
to show that even a spy

169
00:15:47,096 --> 00:15:48,865
gets a capable advocate.

170
00:15:48,898 --> 00:15:51,033
Well, maybe it's the kind of honor
we could do without.

171
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:52,467
Hey, honey,
what are you doing home?

172
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,870
I got stood up.

173
00:15:55,938 --> 00:15:58,374
Well, that's despicable.

174
00:15:58,407 --> 00:15:59,976
Who is this knot-head?

175
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:01,177
I'd rather not say.

176
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,346
Well, sit down.
We just started.

177
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,547
People are scared.

178
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,415
They're building
bomb shelters to protect themselves

179
00:16:06,449 --> 00:16:08,851
from people like this man.

180
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,052
I go to the store,

181
00:16:10,086 --> 00:16:13,389
people are buying
canned food and potassium tablets.

182
00:16:13,422 --> 00:16:16,225
It's all about this man
and what he represents.

183
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:18,327
He's a threat to all of us.
A traitor.

184
00:16:18,361 --> 00:16:20,163
Who's a traitor?
The Rosenbergs were traitors.

185
00:16:20,196 --> 00:16:21,097
Who were they?

186
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,199
They gave atomic secrets
to the Russians.

187
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,201
They were Americans.
They betrayed their country.

188
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,303
You can't accuse Abel
of being a traitor.

189
00:16:27,336 --> 00:16:28,871
He's not an American.

190
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,273
Oh, listen to yourself.

191
00:16:30,306 --> 00:16:31,941
You're defending him already.

192
00:16:31,974 --> 00:16:33,009
You're rehearsing it on me.

193
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:35,044
You said you were
just thinking about taking it.

194
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,947
I am just thinking about it,
just very hard.

195
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,917
Everyone deserves a defense.
Every person matters.

196
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,251
Jim, what do we deserve?

197
00:16:42,285 --> 00:16:44,220
Do you know how
people will look at us?

198
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,422
The family of a man
trying to free a traitor?

199
00:16:46,455 --> 00:16:48,357
He's not a traitor, Mary.
Yes, yes.

200
00:16:48,391 --> 00:16:49,926
Roger, get that! He's not a traitor...

201
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:51,194
Why do I have to do
all the work?

202
00:16:51,227 --> 00:16:53,029
Oh! You wait till we say grace.
I'm hungry!

203
00:16:53,062 --> 00:16:54,430
He's about the most unpopular
man in this country,

204
00:16:54,463 --> 00:16:56,065
and you're trying
to take second place!

205
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,500
Yeah, and I'm third.

206
00:16:57,533 --> 00:16:59,502
Carol, you just dated the wrong guy.
I wanna eat.

207
00:16:59,535 --> 00:17:01,070
Mary, don't make
this an argument

208
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,104
when we're not having
an argument.

209
00:17:02,138 --> 00:17:03,406
You're against him,
I'm for him?

210
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,242
No, I'm not for him.
I'm not for the Russians spying on us.

211
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,245
I'm for his right to have a defense
in a court of law,

212
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,280
which is why they call it
a court of law.

213
00:17:11,314 --> 00:17:13,182
I didn't mean
to interrupt dinner.

214
00:17:13,216 --> 00:17:14,417
A court of law...
Hey, Doug.

215
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:19,121
Oh, no, not at all.
Hello, Doug.
Jim was just flailing.

216
00:17:19,155 --> 00:17:21,390
I'm not flailing.
Go ahead, Doug, you can join us for dinner.

217
00:17:21,424 --> 00:17:23,226
We're having
meatloaf tonight.

218
00:17:25,494 --> 00:17:28,030
So, you came over
to help Jim think about

219
00:17:28,064 --> 00:17:29,265
whether he's
taking the case?

220
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,168
Oh, we're taking it!
It's exciting, isn't it?

221
00:17:40,276 --> 00:17:42,011
Lord, we thank thee
for thy blessings

222
00:17:42,044 --> 00:17:43,446
we are about to receive.

223
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,015
Thy bounty through Christ,
our Lord. Amen.

224
00:17:53,456 --> 00:17:55,558
Good morning, sir.
My name is Jim Donovan.

225
00:17:55,591 --> 00:17:57,560
These are my credentials.

226
00:17:57,593 --> 00:18:00,029
I am a partner in
Watters, Cowan and Donovan.

227
00:18:00,062 --> 00:18:03,432
I was admitted to
the New York Bar in 1941.

228
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,340
You have been charged
with three counts and 19 overt acts.

229
00:18:11,374 --> 00:18:14,043
Conspiracy to transmit
United States defense

230
00:18:14,076 --> 00:18:15,578
and atomic secrets
to the Soviet Union,

231
00:18:15,611 --> 00:18:17,346
conspiracy to
gather secrets,

232
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,515
and failing to register
as a foreign agent.

233
00:18:25,388 --> 00:18:27,556
Do many foreign
agents register?

234
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:35,064
If you don't mind
my asking, sir,

235
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,302
since your arrest,
where have you been?

236
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,273
I couldn't say for certain.

237
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:47,642
You don't know?

238
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:51,213
They drove me to an airport

239
00:18:51,247 --> 00:18:53,382
and put me on a plane,
took me off the plane.

240
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:57,053
Somewhere hot.

241
00:18:58,254 --> 00:18:59,288
It's hot here.

242
00:18:59,322 --> 00:19:02,258
Hotter, very humid.

243
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,226
They put me in a room.

244
00:19:06,162 --> 00:19:07,463
Were you beaten?

245
00:19:08,297 --> 00:19:09,498
No.

246
00:19:09,532 --> 00:19:11,500
I was talked to.

247
00:19:11,534 --> 00:19:13,602
Offers were made.

248
00:19:13,636 --> 00:19:14,704
What do you mean?

249
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:18,240
Offers of employment,
to work for your government.

250
00:19:20,543 --> 00:19:23,179
I was told if I cooperated,

251
00:19:23,212 --> 00:19:25,381
no further charges
would be made against me.

252
00:19:26,682 --> 00:19:28,217
And I would be given money.

253
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:30,653
Hmm.

254
00:19:30,686 --> 00:19:32,254
And you declined?

255
00:19:33,656 --> 00:19:36,125
As you see.

256
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:38,527
Well, of course
I can't endorse that.

257
00:19:38,561 --> 00:19:40,496
I feel duty-bound
to urge you

258
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:42,631
to cooperate with
the U.S. government.

259
00:19:42,665 --> 00:19:44,066
Well, I said no.

260
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,303
Perhaps you could relay
to your friends at the CIA that I meant it.

261
00:19:47,336 --> 00:19:49,338
No, no, no.

262
00:19:49,372 --> 00:19:51,307
I... I don't work
for the agency.

263
00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:55,277
I don't work
for the government.

264
00:19:55,311 --> 00:19:58,547
I am here to offer my services
as your legal counsel.

265
00:19:58,581 --> 00:20:01,417
If you accept them
as such,

266
00:20:02,585 --> 00:20:04,186
I work for you.

267
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,655
If I accept you?

268
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,264
Are you good at what you do?

269
00:20:16,732 --> 00:20:19,301
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm pretty good.

270
00:20:21,737 --> 00:20:25,408
Have you represented
many accused spies?

271
00:20:28,344 --> 00:20:30,112
No, not yet.

272
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,216
This will be a first
for the both of us.

273
00:20:37,753 --> 00:20:39,155
Yes.

274
00:20:41,457 --> 00:20:43,225
All right.

275
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:44,693
"All right"?
You accept?

276
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,664
Yes, all right.

277
00:20:48,697 --> 00:20:51,200
Good, okay.

278
00:20:51,233 --> 00:20:52,368
Let's start here.

279
00:20:52,401 --> 00:20:53,536
If you are firm
in your resolve

280
00:20:53,569 --> 00:20:55,171
not to cooperate
with the U.S. government...

281
00:20:55,204 --> 00:20:56,305
I am.

282
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,740
Yeah.

283
00:20:57,773 --> 00:20:59,608
Then do not talk
to anybody else about your case,

284
00:20:59,642 --> 00:21:01,343
inside of government or out.

285
00:21:01,377 --> 00:21:04,480
Except to me,
to the extent that you trust me.

286
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,515
I have a mandate to serve you.
Nobody else does.

287
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:08,317
Quite frankly,
everybody else has an interest

288
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,790
in sending you
to the electric chair.

289
00:21:10,486 --> 00:21:11,486
All right.

290
00:21:15,257 --> 00:21:16,459
You don't seem alarmed.

291
00:21:21,797 --> 00:21:23,399
Would it help?

292
00:21:33,676 --> 00:21:37,746
I... I would like
materials to draw with.

293
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,248
That's not possible.

294
00:21:40,282 --> 00:21:42,218
A pencil, a piece of paper.

295
00:21:42,251 --> 00:21:43,452
Cigarettes.

296
00:21:45,788 --> 00:21:47,423
Please?

297
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,633
Mr. Donovan,
you have men like me

298
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:00,236
doing the same
for your country.

299
00:22:01,337 --> 00:22:03,706
If they were caught,

300
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,642
I'm sure that you would
wish them to be treated well.

301
00:22:11,313 --> 00:22:12,581
What's your name?

302
00:22:12,615 --> 00:22:14,250
Francis Gary Powers.

303
00:22:16,452 --> 00:22:18,287
Rank, service?

304
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,523
First Lieutenant,
United States Air Force.

305
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,293
Do you have any association

306
00:22:24,326 --> 00:22:26,328
with the Soviet Union,
Lieutenant Powers?

307
00:22:26,362 --> 00:22:27,563
Kidding?

308
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,764
Just answer the questions,
Lieutenant.

309
00:22:28,797 --> 00:22:31,367
Yes, no,
or as simply as you can.

310
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,569
Do you have any association
with the Soviet Union?

311
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,304
Hell, no.

312
00:22:36,872 --> 00:22:38,307
Do you know
why you're here?

313
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,508
Mmm-mmm.

314
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,611
Is that a no?

315
00:22:42,645 --> 00:22:44,847
Yes. I mean...

316
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,749
No, it's just "no."

317
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,318
Yes, I have absolutely
no idea why I'm here.

318
00:22:49,351 --> 00:22:50,519
Eyes front, Lieutenant.

319
00:22:50,553 --> 00:22:51,687
Yes, sir.

320
00:23:09,438 --> 00:23:10,673
How'd you do in there, Gary?

321
00:23:12,508 --> 00:23:15,411
Pretty good.
Think I got my name right.

322
00:23:15,444 --> 00:23:18,380
You probably
outscored Shinn, then.

323
00:23:19,848 --> 00:23:21,283
Who's winning?

324
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:22,551
Uh, that would be me.

325
00:23:22,585 --> 00:23:24,520
Oh. Well, deal me in.

326
00:23:24,553 --> 00:23:26,755
So, these are
all mine, then.

327
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:28,624
I told you boys
not to play with him.

328
00:23:55,651 --> 00:23:57,486
Okay, drivers,
here's the deal.

329
00:23:58,954 --> 00:24:00,823
You've been selected
for a mission

330
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,391
which you are
not to discuss

331
00:24:02,424 --> 00:24:04,693
with anyone
outside of this room.

332
00:24:04,727 --> 00:24:06,462
No one.

333
00:24:06,495 --> 00:24:08,530
I don't care who you trust.

334
00:24:08,564 --> 00:24:10,532
Wife, mother, sweetheart.

335
00:24:10,566 --> 00:24:12,534
The good Lord
when you pray at night.

336
00:24:12,568 --> 00:24:14,503
You don't tell
any of them anything

337
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,338
of what
I'm about to tell you.

338
00:24:18,841 --> 00:24:21,577
Each of you drivers has
met certain qualifications.

339
00:24:22,444 --> 00:24:24,647
High level
security clearance.

340
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,448
Exceptional pilot ratings

341
00:24:26,482 --> 00:24:28,450
in excess of
the required hours flight time

342
00:24:28,484 --> 00:24:30,419
in a single-seat aircraft.

343
00:24:30,452 --> 00:24:33,422
We are engaged in a war.

344
00:24:33,455 --> 00:24:35,691
This war does not, for the moment,
involve men-at-arms.

345
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,593
It involves information.

346
00:24:37,626 --> 00:24:39,828
You will be
collecting information.

347
00:24:39,862 --> 00:24:42,698
You will be gathering
intelligence about the enemy.

348
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:46,368
The intelligence you gather
could give us the upper hand

349
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,937
in a full thermonuclear exchange
with the Soviet Union.

350
00:24:50,973 --> 00:24:52,408
Or it could prevent one.

351
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,944
For public purposes,

352
00:24:55,978 --> 00:24:57,746
as far as your wife or mother

353
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,748
or sweetheart
or the good Lord above,

354
00:24:59,782 --> 00:25:01,784
your mission does not exist.

355
00:25:01,817 --> 00:25:04,653
If it does not exist,
you do not exist.

356
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:07,790
You cannot be shot down.
You cannot be captured.

357
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,864
You work for the CIA now.

358
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:32,614
So, Jim, I heard your guy is
speaking with a phony accent.

359
00:25:33,716 --> 00:25:35,718
Does he keep that up
all the time?

360
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:38,487
Actually, I'm pretty sure
that's just the way he talks.

361
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,622
He's got the Russian name
but a British passport.

362
00:25:40,656 --> 00:25:43,559
Well, I doubt
that that's genuine.

363
00:25:43,592 --> 00:25:45,861
So, Jim, where are we?
I see here...

364
00:25:45,894 --> 00:25:48,497
Yes, uh, Judge, you see,

365
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:52,901
I just don't think that three weeks
is going to do it, here.

366
00:25:52,935 --> 00:25:54,903
We... We got a massive amount
of evidence, as you know.

367
00:25:54,937 --> 00:25:56,004
You wanna postpone?

368
00:25:56,038 --> 00:25:57,206
Six weeks.

369
00:25:57,239 --> 00:26:00,709
I mean, there's just myself
and my associate, basically.

370
00:26:00,743 --> 00:26:01,944
Jim, is this serious?

371
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:02,978
Sir?

372
00:26:06,048 --> 00:26:07,816
Is this serious?

373
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,485
Yes. Yes, indeed, it is.

374
00:26:09,518 --> 00:26:10,919
You can see
in the filing...

375
00:26:10,953 --> 00:26:13,789
Jim, this man is a Soviet spy.

376
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,492
Allegedly.
Come on, Counselor!

377
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,561
Your Honor.

378
00:26:19,595 --> 00:26:20,996
Of course, I salute you.

379
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:23,565
We all salute you for
taking on a thankless task.

380
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:25,467
This man has to have
due process.

381
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:26,769
But let's not kid each other.

382
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:30,806
He'll receive
a capable defense.

383
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:34,543
And, God willing,
he'll be convicted.

384
00:26:34,576 --> 00:26:35,944
Come on, Counselor.

385
00:26:35,978 --> 00:26:37,513
Let's not play games
with this.

386
00:26:37,546 --> 00:26:39,648
Not in my courtroom.

387
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,683
We have a date

388
00:26:41,717 --> 00:26:43,552
and we're going to trial.

389
00:26:52,728 --> 00:26:54,696
Taxi!

390
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:56,498
Taxi!

391
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:59,501
I see your light on!
Son of a bitch.

392
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:03,572
Can't wait to get back
to Manhattan.

393
00:27:03,605 --> 00:27:04,807
His light was on, right?

394
00:27:05,941 --> 00:27:07,776
Son of a bitch.

395
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,625
Against their
level of comfort.

396
00:27:56,658 --> 00:27:57,726
The statute hasn't changed.

397
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,161
Oh, excuse me, sir.

398
00:27:59,194 --> 00:28:00,863
Pardon me. Sorry. Oh!

399
00:28:32,194 --> 00:28:33,862
Mr. Donovan.

400
00:28:36,198 --> 00:28:37,866
What?

401
00:28:41,203 --> 00:28:42,804
What?

402
00:28:55,117 --> 00:28:57,085
CIA.

403
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:58,119
Yeah.

404
00:28:59,021 --> 00:29:00,188
I just wanted to chat.

405
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,994
How's the case going?

406
00:29:06,028 --> 00:29:08,797
Case is going great.
Couldn't be better.

407
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,898
Mmm-hmm.

408
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:11,934
Has your guy talked?

409
00:29:16,271 --> 00:29:18,907
Excuse me.

410
00:29:18,941 --> 00:29:21,677
You met him. Has he talked?
Has he said anything yet?

411
00:29:23,946 --> 00:29:25,781
We're not having
this conversation.

412
00:29:25,814 --> 00:29:27,916
No, of course not.

413
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:30,118
No, I mean,
we really are not having it.

414
00:29:30,152 --> 00:29:33,855
You're asking me to violate
attorney-client privilege.

415
00:29:33,889 --> 00:29:35,157
Oh, come on, Counselor.

416
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,158
You know,
I wish people like you

417
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,259
would quit saying
"Oh, come on, Counselor."

418
00:29:37,292 --> 00:29:39,161
I didn't like it the first
time it happened today.

419
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,996
A judge said it to me twice.

420
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,031
And the more I hear it,
the more I don't like it.

421
00:29:46,301 --> 00:29:48,904
Okay, well, listen,
I understand attorney-client privilege.

422
00:29:48,937 --> 00:29:52,140
I understand
all the legal gamesmanship.

423
00:29:52,174 --> 00:29:54,876
And I understand
that's how you make a living.

424
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:57,779
But I'm talking to you
about something else.

425
00:29:59,781 --> 00:30:01,883
The security
of your country.

426
00:30:01,917 --> 00:30:05,053
And I'm sorry
if the way I put it offends you.

427
00:30:05,087 --> 00:30:08,757
But we need to know
what Abel is telling you.

428
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,859
You understand me, Donovan?

429
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,928
We need to know.

430
00:30:12,961 --> 00:30:14,730
Don't go "Boy Scout" on me.

431
00:30:16,198 --> 00:30:18,000
We don't have
a rule book, here.

432
00:30:19,201 --> 00:30:21,303
You're Agent Hoffman, yeah?

433
00:30:21,336 --> 00:30:23,205
Yeah.

434
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,307
German extraction.

435
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,775
Yeah, so?

436
00:30:26,808 --> 00:30:28,710
My name's Donovan. Irish.

437
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:31,146
Both sides,
mother and father.

438
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:34,316
I'm Irish, you're German.

439
00:30:34,349 --> 00:30:37,185
But what makes us
both Americans?

440
00:30:37,219 --> 00:30:39,287
Just one thing.

441
00:30:39,321 --> 00:30:40,956
One, one, one.

442
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,090
The rule book.

443
00:30:44,226 --> 00:30:45,994
We call it the Constitution

444
00:30:46,028 --> 00:30:47,996
and we agree to the rules,

445
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,798
and that's what
makes us Americans.

446
00:30:49,831 --> 00:30:50,966
It's all that
makes us Americans

447
00:30:50,999 --> 00:30:52,067
so don't tell me
there's no rule book,

448
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,703
and don't nod at me like that,
you son of a bitch.

449
00:31:05,847 --> 00:31:07,249
Do we need to
worry about you?

450
00:31:08,884 --> 00:31:11,720
Not if I'm left alone
to do my job.

451
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,036
From this moment forward

452
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:30,806
you will not refer to the U-2
as a spy plane

453
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:32,841
or reconnaissance aircraft.

454
00:31:32,874 --> 00:31:35,110
You will refer to it
as <i>"The Article."

455
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:38,280
<i>The Article</i>
has an 80-foot wingspan.

456
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:43,819
It's powered by a single Pratt and Whitney
J57 P-37 engine.

457
00:31:43,852 --> 00:31:46,221
10,000 pounds of thrust

458
00:31:46,254 --> 00:31:50,292
and a maximum speed
of 430 miles an hour.

459
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,060
She may not be quick,

460
00:31:52,094 --> 00:31:54,996
but at your cruising altitude
of 70,000 feet,

461
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,832
nothing will
come close to you.

462
00:31:56,865 --> 00:31:57,999
70,000?

463
00:31:58,033 --> 00:32:01,002
The idea is the enemy doesn't
even know you're there.

464
00:32:01,036 --> 00:32:02,904
It looks kind of flimsy.

465
00:32:05,907 --> 00:32:09,911
Every extra pound of weight
costs a foot in altitude,

466
00:32:09,945 --> 00:32:11,780
and we need
to accommodate the cameras.

467
00:32:13,915 --> 00:32:17,886
That's a 4,500-millimeter
lens, times three.

468
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,222
A pin-sharp
panoramic camera

469
00:32:20,255 --> 00:32:24,893
four times as powerful as any aerial
reconnaissance cameras we've ever used.

470
00:32:24,926 --> 00:32:28,130
You're gonna be taking
pictures, lots of pictures.

471
00:32:28,163 --> 00:32:30,432
At 70,000 feet,
<i>The Article</i> can photograph

472
00:32:30,465 --> 00:32:34,402
2,000 square miles
of territory in one pass.

473
00:32:34,436 --> 00:32:36,171
Now, drivers,

474
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:39,341
give Agent Sumner
your undivided attention.

475
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:43,445
The items you will need
on your mission are over here.

476
00:32:43,478 --> 00:32:46,181
B camera,
Revere 8 model 40 magazine,

477
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:49,050
Keystone Capri K-25, silver.

478
00:32:49,084 --> 00:32:51,052
Hollow-handle shaving brush.

479
00:32:51,086 --> 00:32:54,222
Complete set of cipher tables
on edible silver foil.

480
00:32:54,256 --> 00:32:56,091
Specialist photographic
equipment.

481
00:32:58,293 --> 00:33:00,996
Yeah, we, uh...
We get the idea. Thank you.

482
00:33:13,175 --> 00:33:16,244
Uh, excuse me,
Agent, uh, Bosco. "Blasco."

483
00:33:16,278 --> 00:33:18,113
Sir.

484
00:33:18,146 --> 00:33:23,151
There seems to be
a subsection to this list here.

485
00:33:23,185 --> 00:33:25,187
Well, most of this stuff
came from his studio,

486
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,380
but the rest is from the
hotel room he was holed up in.

487
00:33:27,489 --> 00:33:29,024
Where we found him.

488
00:33:30,358 --> 00:33:32,460
The hotel room you searched?

489
00:33:32,494 --> 00:33:34,262
Well, yeah.

490
00:33:34,296 --> 00:33:36,364
Can I see the warrant?

491
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:37,999
The what?

492
00:33:39,401 --> 00:33:41,970
Yeah, explain this to me.
There was a warrant.

493
00:33:42,003 --> 00:33:43,338
There was a warrant.

494
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:45,440
A civil detention writ
for the arrest of an alien,

495
00:33:45,473 --> 00:33:47,342
but there was
no search warrant

496
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:49,177
for suspicion
of criminal activity.

497
00:33:49,211 --> 00:33:50,445
So, the search
and the evidence

498
00:33:50,478 --> 00:33:52,214
that is
the fruit of that search,

499
00:33:52,247 --> 00:33:54,349
that's all tainted
and should not be admitted.

500
00:33:54,382 --> 00:33:57,118
What protections is he due,
Your Honor? The man is not...

501
00:33:57,152 --> 00:33:59,988
The man is what?
He's Rudolf Ivanovich Abel.

502
00:34:00,021 --> 00:34:01,923
He is a Soviet citizen.

503
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:03,225
He's not an American.

504
00:34:03,258 --> 00:34:07,395
1886,
<i>Yick Wo v. Hopkins.

505
00:34:07,429 --> 00:34:10,532
The court held that even aliens,
in that case Chinese immigrants,

506
00:34:10,565 --> 00:34:13,935
could not be held to answer for a crime
without due process of law,

507
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,129
including any alien that entered
the country illegally.

508
00:34:16,404 --> 00:34:18,006
The Department of Justice

509
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:21,276
has its first allegiance
to the United States.

510
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,411
I don't see how an alien,
if he's here illegally,

511
00:34:23,445 --> 00:34:26,314
how he suffered
deprivation of rights.

512
00:34:26,348 --> 00:34:28,149
Rights as what?

513
00:34:28,183 --> 00:34:30,018
An American?

514
00:34:30,051 --> 00:34:33,188
Rights as what, Counselor?

515
00:34:33,221 --> 00:34:35,023
We're in a battle
for civilization.

516
00:34:35,056 --> 00:34:38,260
This Russian spy came here
to threaten our way of life.

517
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:40,362
Now, I have a courtroom
of people waiting.

518
00:34:40,395 --> 00:34:42,397
Get out there,
sit beside the Russian.

519
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:44,566
Let's get this
over and done with.

520
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:47,035
And your motion is denied.

521
00:34:49,537 --> 00:34:51,973
He should take some
insurance out on himself.

522
00:34:52,474 --> 00:34:53,575
How did we do?

523
00:34:53,608 --> 00:34:55,043
In there?

524
00:34:56,378 --> 00:34:57,445
Uh...

525
00:34:57,479 --> 00:34:59,447
Not too good.

526
00:34:59,481 --> 00:35:01,483
Apparently, you're not
an American citizen.

527
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,451
That's true.

528
00:35:03,485 --> 00:35:05,253
And according
to your boss,

529
00:35:05,287 --> 00:35:06,955
you're not
a Soviet citizen either.

530
00:35:08,223 --> 00:35:10,292
Well, the boss
isn't always right

531
00:35:12,093 --> 00:35:13,528
but he's always the boss.

532
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,533
Do you never worry?

533
00:35:20,635 --> 00:35:22,504
Would it help?

534
00:35:29,644 --> 00:35:30,644
All rise.

535
00:35:33,515 --> 00:35:37,252
"I pledge allegiance

"with liberty and justice

540
00:35:55,603 --> 00:35:57,405
<i>First,
you have to know what happens

541
00:35:57,439 --> 00:35:59,474
<i>when an atomic bomb explodes.

542
00:36:02,177 --> 00:36:05,313
<i>There is a bright flash,
brighter than the sun.

543
00:36:05,347 --> 00:36:08,483
<i>It can smash in buildings,
break windows all over town.

544
00:36:11,553 --> 00:36:14,556
<i>But if you duck and cover
like Bert,

545
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,524
<i>you will be much safer.

546
00:36:16,558 --> 00:36:18,660
<i>There are
two kinds of attack,

547
00:36:18,693 --> 00:36:21,129
<i>with warning
and without any warning.

548
00:36:23,498 --> 00:36:24,498
Mmm.

549
00:36:26,201 --> 00:36:27,435
What's going on in here?

550
00:36:27,469 --> 00:36:29,337
Okay, Dad,
this is really important.

551
00:36:29,371 --> 00:36:31,406
When the war begins,
the first thing they do

552
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,142
is cut off all the water
and all the electricity.

553
00:36:34,175 --> 00:36:36,277
So the first thing we should do
is keep this filled,

554
00:36:36,311 --> 00:36:37,645
use the shower in your room,

555
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:40,181
use the sink downstairs,
the garden hose outside...

556
00:36:40,215 --> 00:36:42,283
Those are good ideas.

557
00:36:42,317 --> 00:36:44,285
But, Roger, I don't see this

558
00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:46,199
as being something
you ever have to worry about.

559
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:48,890
Yeah, but when
you hear the sirens,

560
00:36:48,923 --> 00:36:52,127
there may not be enough time
to fill the tub and the sinks.

561
00:36:53,161 --> 00:36:54,596
Not gonna be any sirens...

562
00:36:56,231 --> 00:36:57,565
What is this?

563
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:58,633
When the bomb comes,

564
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:01,503
the Reds will aim
for the Empire State Building.

565
00:37:01,536 --> 00:37:04,339
But the bomb goes off
at 10,000 feet up.

566
00:37:04,372 --> 00:37:06,307
In <i>Life</i> magazine,
it's called an airburst,

567
00:37:06,341 --> 00:37:08,343
and if the bomb
is 50 megatons,

568
00:37:08,376 --> 00:37:11,546
the blast wave goes
out and out and out

569
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:14,115
and melts everything
from here to here.

570
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:15,383
Including where we live.
Here.

571
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,319
Yeah, right there.

572
00:37:18,353 --> 00:37:19,454
But, you know, Roger,

573
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:22,123
no one is dropping
atomic bombs on us.

574
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:23,525
But the Russians want to.

575
00:37:23,558 --> 00:37:25,460
You know that Russian guy
you're defending?

576
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,561
He's here
to get things ready

577
00:37:26,594 --> 00:37:28,396
for the guys
who drop the bombs.

578
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:30,498
No, no, he's not...
Not here for that.

579
00:37:30,532 --> 00:37:32,133
He's not even Russian.

580
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,202
He was born, we think,
in Northern England.

581
00:37:34,235 --> 00:37:35,475
Yeah, but he's
a spy for Russia.

582
00:37:36,738 --> 00:37:38,740
I don't even understand
what you're doing.

583
00:37:38,773 --> 00:37:41,209
You're not a Communist,
so why are you defending one?

584
00:37:41,242 --> 00:37:43,211
Well, because it's my job.

585
00:37:43,244 --> 00:37:45,280

Whether you did it or not
doesn't matter.

620

The state has to prove it,
that you're a spy.

No, not really.

623
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,903
I always assumed
you were an artist.

624

My wife, she's the artist.

625
00:40:23,905 --> 00:40:26,507
She's a musician

626

in the Children's Orchestra
of Moscow.

627
00:40:30,378 --> 00:40:31,713
What instrument?

The harp.

Oh.

Then, she's an angel.

631
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:50,431
Standing there like that,
you remind me of a man

632
00:40:50,465 --> 00:40:52,700
who used to come
to our house when I was young.

633
00:40:53,968 --> 00:40:57,472
My father used to say,
"Watch this man."

634
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,909
So I did,
every time he came.

635
00:41:01,943 --> 00:41:04,912
And never once

636
00:41:04,946 --> 00:41:07,782
did he do
anything remarkable.

637
00:41:09,984 --> 00:41:12,353
And I remind you of him?

638
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:19,594
This one time, I was
about the age of your son.

639
00:41:19,627 --> 00:41:22,730
Our house was overrun
by partisan border guards.

640
00:41:26,534 --> 00:41:28,836
Dozens of them.

641
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:30,905
My father was beaten,
my mother was beaten,

642
00:41:30,938 --> 00:41:34,342
and this man,
my father's friend, he was beaten.

643
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:37,945
And I watched this man.

644
00:41:41,449 --> 00:41:42,817
Every time they hit him

645
00:41:44,952 --> 00:41:46,654
he stood back up again.

646
00:41:48,856 --> 00:41:50,425
So they hit him harder.

647
00:41:52,694 --> 00:41:54,762
Still,
he got back to his feet.

648
00:41:58,466 --> 00:42:00,702
I think because of this
they stopped the beating.

649
00:42:00,735 --> 00:42:02,437
They let him live.

650
00:42:10,645 --> 00:42:12,680
I remember them saying it.

651
00:42:20,521 --> 00:42:22,590
It sort of means, like, uh,

652
00:42:24,926 --> 00:42:26,394
"standing man."

653
00:42:30,031 --> 00:42:31,031
Standing man.

654
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:45,513
Hello, Jim!
Millie, you're a vision.

655
00:42:45,546 --> 00:42:47,915
Mortie's busy
getting kitted out.

656
00:42:47,949 --> 00:42:49,450
But come on in.

657
00:42:50,952 --> 00:42:53,621
Scotch, Jim?
Oh, yes, please. Thank you.

658
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,490
Uh, just a drop of water.

659
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:57,759
Your Honor.

660
00:42:57,792 --> 00:43:00,661
Hello, Jim!
Just going out.

661
00:43:00,695 --> 00:43:02,663
Got a few minutes though.

662
00:43:02,697 --> 00:43:05,666
March of Dimes thing.
Millie is active.

663
00:43:07,101 --> 00:43:08,870
Well, thank you
for seeing me.

664
00:43:08,903 --> 00:43:12,940
I just wanted to give you
my two cents on the sentencing.

665
00:43:12,974 --> 00:43:16,077
And I thought maybe
I should pester you at home

666
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:19,080
as not all of my points
are narrowly legal.

667
00:43:19,113 --> 00:43:21,883
Yeah, well,
it's that kind of case.

668
00:43:21,916 --> 00:43:23,951
I hope I wasn't too scratchy
during the trial

669
00:43:23,985 --> 00:43:26,821
but it's exactly
what you say.

670
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,790
Nothing about this
is narrowly legal.

671
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:31,726
There are bigger issues.

672
00:43:33,127 --> 00:43:34,796
Bigger issues!

673
00:43:37,131 --> 00:43:38,900
Thank you, thank you.

674
00:43:38,933 --> 00:43:39,934
Uh...

675
00:43:41,936 --> 00:43:43,704
Sir...

676
00:43:43,738 --> 00:43:45,740
I think it could be
considered

677
00:43:45,773 --> 00:43:48,543
in the best interests
of the United States

678
00:43:48,576 --> 00:43:51,512
that Abel remain alive.

679
00:43:52,013 --> 00:43:53,815
Why?

680
00:43:53,848 --> 00:43:55,583
I'm not saying
I've made up my mind

681
00:43:55,616 --> 00:43:56,751
but if he was
gonna cooperate,

682
00:43:56,784 --> 00:43:58,953
work with the government,
he would've done it already.

683
00:43:58,986 --> 00:44:00,087
- True, but the issue here...
- You can't...

684
00:44:00,121 --> 00:44:01,823
Excuse me.

685
00:44:06,627 --> 00:44:09,730
You can't say it's in the best interest
of the United States

686
00:44:09,764 --> 00:44:13,734
that he spend
the rest of his days in a prison cell.

687
00:44:13,768 --> 00:44:15,837
How is this
the national interest?

688
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:18,005
Not the incarceration
itself, sir.

689
00:44:19,674 --> 00:44:22,743
It is possible that,
in the foreseeable future,

690
00:44:22,777 --> 00:44:25,012
an American
of equivalent rank

691
00:44:25,046 --> 00:44:27,782
might be captured
by Soviet Russia.

692
00:44:27,815 --> 00:44:30,051
We might want to have
someone to trade.

693
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,752
Wow.

694
00:44:31,786 --> 00:44:33,955
That sounds like
spinning what-ifs.

695
00:44:33,988 --> 00:44:35,890
You could do that
till the cows come home.

696
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:38,860
It's my business, what-ifs.
I'm in insurance.

697
00:44:38,893 --> 00:44:41,162
And there's nothing
implausible about this one.

698
00:44:41,195 --> 00:44:44,599
It's entirely in the realm
of what could happen.

699
00:44:44,632 --> 00:44:48,002
It's the kind of probability that
people buy insurance for.

700
00:44:48,035 --> 00:44:51,973
If we send this guy to his death,
we leave ourselves wide open.

701
00:44:52,006 --> 00:44:54,775
No policy
in our back pocket

702
00:44:54,809 --> 00:44:56,611
for the day the storm comes.

703
00:44:58,813 --> 00:45:01,048
Nice speech.

704
00:45:01,082 --> 00:45:06,721
Sir, there is also
the humanitarian argument.

705
00:45:06,754 --> 00:45:09,824
Should he die for doing the job
they sent him to do?

706
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,094
All right, Counselor.

707
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:16,864
I gotta run.

708
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:21,969
Good seeing you, Jim.

709
00:45:26,173 --> 00:45:27,642
I'll walk you out.

710
00:45:31,112 --> 00:45:32,112
All rise.

711
00:45:33,848 --> 00:45:35,149
The United States
District Court

712
00:45:35,182 --> 00:45:37,852
for the Eastern District
of New York is now in session.

713
00:45:37,885 --> 00:45:39,954
The honorable
Mortimer Byers presiding.

714
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:45,993
Be seated.

715
00:45:57,905 --> 00:45:59,707
The defendant
will please rise.

716
00:46:14,255 --> 00:46:15,990
In the measured judgment
of this court

717
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,258
the following sentence,

718
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:19,794
based upon the jury's
verdict of guilty

719
00:46:19,827 --> 00:46:22,129
as to each count
of the indictment,

720
00:46:22,163 --> 00:46:26,968
is believed to meet the test
which has been stated.

721
00:46:27,001 --> 00:46:29,904
Pursuant to the verdict
of guilty as to all counts,

722
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:34,141
the defendant is committed
to the custody

723
00:46:34,175 --> 00:46:36,243
of the Attorney General
of the United States

724
00:46:38,279 --> 00:46:40,781
for imprisonment
in a federal institution

725
00:46:40,815 --> 00:46:44,251
to be selected by him
for a period of 30 years.

726
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:47,755
Marshals, you may take
the defendant into custody.

727
00:46:47,788 --> 00:46:48,889
No... No electrocution?

728
00:46:48,923 --> 00:46:50,291
No. No, no.

729
00:46:50,324 --> 00:46:52,059
Why aren't we hanging him?

730
00:46:52,093 --> 00:46:53,294
In the name of God,
why aren't we hanging him?

731
00:46:53,327 --> 00:46:55,229
Sit down, sir!

732
00:46:55,262 --> 00:46:58,966
He's a spy!
He's killing us with his lies!

733
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,735
In the name of God,
why aren't we hanging him?

734
00:47:00,768 --> 00:47:01,769
That's right!

735
00:47:03,337 --> 00:47:05,072
He's a spy!

736
00:47:09,276 --> 00:47:11,178
Mr. Donovan! Mr. Donovan!

737
00:47:11,212 --> 00:47:14,181
Just one question.
Just one question, sir.

738
00:47:21,222 --> 00:47:22,990
My hat! My hat! My hat!

739
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,761
Nobody here has a comment.

740
00:47:26,794 --> 00:47:28,329
Mr. and Mrs. Donovan
are not answering questions.

741
00:47:28,362 --> 00:47:29,764
How do you feel now that

742
00:47:29,797 --> 00:47:30,965
this national nightmare
is over?

743
00:47:30,998 --> 00:47:32,299
Mr. Donovan, are
you happy with the verdict?

744
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:35,936
We're... We're in
firm ground on, uh, for a case on appeal.

745
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:37,210
Appeal?
Appeal, yes.

746
00:47:51,385 --> 00:47:53,220
Jim, you did a great job.

747
00:47:53,254 --> 00:47:56,023
You fulfilled your mandate
and then some.

748
00:47:56,057 --> 00:47:58,059
But the man is a spy.

749
00:47:58,092 --> 00:48:00,795
The verdict is correct
and there's no reason to appeal it.

750
00:48:00,828 --> 00:48:02,763
There's ample
procedural reason.

751
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:03,864
We know the search
is tainted.

752
00:48:03,898 --> 00:48:05,066
And Fourth Amendment issues

753
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:07,101
will always weigh more heavily
in an appellate forum.

754
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,836
We've got a good shot.

755
00:48:08,869 --> 00:48:11,839
What the goddamn hell
are you talking about?

756
00:48:11,872 --> 00:48:15,076
We were supposed to show
he had a capable defense, which we did.

757
00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:17,378
Why are you citing
the goddamn Constitution at me?

758
00:48:17,411 --> 00:48:19,113
Tom, if you
look me in the eye

759
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,182
and tell me
we don't have grounds

760
00:48:21,215 --> 00:48:22,216
for an appeal,
I'll drop it right now.

761
00:48:22,249 --> 00:48:24,385
I'm not saying that.
You know what I'm saying.

762
00:48:24,418 --> 00:48:26,854
Tom is saying there's
a cost to these things.

763
00:48:26,887 --> 00:48:28,389
That's right.

764
00:48:28,422 --> 00:48:31,058
A cost to both
your family and your firm.

765
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:08,896
I've missed music.

766
00:49:08,929 --> 00:49:11,265
They checked the radio to make
sure there was no transmitter in it.

767
00:49:11,298 --> 00:49:13,167
I'm sure they did.

768
00:49:15,336 --> 00:49:17,204
Shostakovich. Mmm.

769
00:49:19,306 --> 00:49:21,909
That's a very great artist,
Shostakovich.

770
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,959
Uh, I think

771
00:49:40,361 --> 00:49:44,331
our strongest grounds
for reversal

772
00:49:44,365 --> 00:49:45,365
are constitutional.

773
00:49:48,502 --> 00:49:52,239
Our best chance is if the Supreme Court
agrees to review our case.

774
00:49:57,912 --> 00:49:59,113
Jim...

775
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:07,154
You should be careful.

776
00:50:12,993 --> 00:50:14,128
Careful.

00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,529
Oh, I have instructions
to leave two cars here.

804
00:51:22,563 --> 00:51:23,430
It'll be pretty obvious

805
00:51:23,464 --> 00:51:24,465
that this is a secure...
For how long?

806
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:27,001
I have to be in Washington
later on this week.

807
00:51:27,034 --> 00:51:28,402
What are you doing?

808
00:51:28,435 --> 00:51:29,570
What are you doing
to your family?

809
00:51:29,603 --> 00:51:31,272
Pardon me, Officer?

810
00:51:31,305 --> 00:51:32,439
You're still
defending this guy?

811
00:51:32,473 --> 00:51:33,207
I mean, what are you
fighting for him for?

812
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,309
Okay, knock that off,
Officer.

813
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:36,577
I'll knock off nothing.

814
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:38,245
I was in the third wave
at Omaha Beach.

815
00:51:38,279 --> 00:51:39,380
Hey, I did my time
in the service.

816
00:51:39,413 --> 00:51:41,315
I was fighting these guys,
and you're defending them?

817
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:44,051
Why don't you just
do your job as an officer of the law?

818
00:51:44,084 --> 00:51:45,586
Okay, I'm sorry.
Let's go outside. Come on.

819
00:51:45,619 --> 00:51:47,154
You know what?
Just forget him.

820
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:48,455
What am I not getting here?

821
00:51:48,489 --> 00:51:52,459
Outside, Officer. I'm sorry.

822
00:51:52,493 --> 00:51:55,296
Defending a commie spy. Jeez!

823
00:52:12,613 --> 00:52:15,149
Do you feel
that you deserve this, sir?

824
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,572
Should it become necessary

825
00:52:38,605 --> 00:52:41,642
to abandon the aircraft
over Soviet territory,

826
00:52:41,675 --> 00:52:44,244
then there's a two-and-a-half pound
explosive charge

827
00:52:44,278 --> 00:52:46,513
contained within
the fuselage.

828
00:52:46,547 --> 00:52:49,516
Now, first,
you activate the circuits.

829
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:54,455
But to start
the 70-second timer,

830
00:52:54,488 --> 00:52:57,391
you need to flip the switch
marked "Destruct."

831
00:53:00,361 --> 00:53:04,498
It is imperative that these
flights remain a secret

832
00:53:04,531 --> 00:53:08,068
and this equipment
does not fall into enemy hands.

833
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:10,237
What about us?

834
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:12,439
I don't know if you're kidding,
Lieutenant Powers.

835
00:53:12,473 --> 00:53:14,141
I'm not.

836
00:53:16,377 --> 00:53:17,678
What you know
about the plane

837
00:53:17,711 --> 00:53:20,080
is as secret
as the plane itself.

838
00:53:22,249 --> 00:53:25,419
If capture
is a foregone conclusion,

839
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,488
you go down with your plane.

840
00:53:27,521 --> 00:53:30,424
Now, if you think
you can ditch and get away,

841
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,126
if you're close enough
to a border, fine.

842
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:33,394
You know
the ejection protocol.

843
00:53:36,163 --> 00:53:38,565
But if you ditch,

844
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:40,701
you bring the dollar with you.

845
00:53:40,734 --> 00:53:43,270
All right,
there's a pin inside.

846
00:53:45,506 --> 00:53:48,442
You scratch your skin
anywhere, it's instantaneous.

847
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:51,445
If you think you are
about to be captured,

848
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:52,646
you use it.

849
00:53:56,617 --> 00:53:58,552
Drivers, you understand me?

850
00:54:00,421 --> 00:54:02,089
Spend the dollar.

851
00:54:56,777 --> 00:54:59,346
Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the court.

852
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:02,716
The "Cold War" is not
just a phrase, Your Honor.

853
00:55:02,749 --> 00:55:05,385
It's not just
a figure of speech.

854
00:55:05,419 --> 00:55:07,554
Truly,
a battle is being fought

855
00:55:07,588 --> 00:55:11,391
between two competing views
of the world.

856
00:55:11,425 --> 00:55:14,661
I contend
that Rudolf Ivanovich Abel,

857
00:55:14,695 --> 00:55:16,797
"Colonel Abel,"
as he was called

858
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:19,266
even by the men
who arrested him,

859
00:55:19,299 --> 00:55:22,436
is our foe in that battle.

860
00:55:22,469 --> 00:55:24,204
Auxiliary power?

861
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:25,806
Connected and on.

862
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:28,275
Oxygen seat-pack supply?

863
00:55:28,308 --> 00:55:29,743
Supply at 1,800 psi.

864
00:55:29,776 --> 00:55:31,445
Inverter?

865
00:55:31,478 --> 00:55:32,613
On, light out.

866
00:55:32,646 --> 00:55:35,816
He was treated
as a combatant in that war

867
00:55:35,849 --> 00:55:39,820
until it no longer
suited our government to so treat him.

868
00:55:39,853 --> 00:55:42,222
Accordingly,

869
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:45,692
he was not given the protections
we give our own citizens.

870
00:55:45,726 --> 00:55:47,461
He was subjected
to treatment that,

871
00:55:47,494 --> 00:55:50,264
however appropriate
for a suspected enemy,

872
00:55:50,297 --> 00:55:52,766
was not appropriate
to a suspected criminal.

873
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:54,234
Fuel transfer?

874
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:55,335
Transfer switch off.

875
00:55:55,369 --> 00:55:56,470
Destructor?

876
00:55:56,503 --> 00:55:57,638
Destructor safety.

877
00:55:57,671 --> 00:55:58,839
Climb data card.

878
00:55:58,872 --> 00:56:00,407
Installed in aircraft.

879
00:56:14,555 --> 00:56:16,557
I know this man.

880
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:20,394
If the charge is true, he serves a
foreign power but he serves it faithfully.

881
00:56:20,427 --> 00:56:24,364
If he is a soldier in the opposing army,
he is a good soldier.

882
00:56:24,398 --> 00:56:27,334
He has not fled the field
of battle to save himself.

883
00:56:27,367 --> 00:56:29,536
He has refused
to serve his captor.

884
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:31,872
He has refused
to betray his cause.

885
00:56:31,905 --> 00:56:34,474
He has refused
to take the coward's way out.

886
00:56:34,508 --> 00:56:37,344
The coward
must abandon his dignity

887
00:56:37,377 --> 00:56:38,879
before he abandons
the field of battle.

888
00:56:38,912 --> 00:56:42,349
That,
Rudolf Abel will never do.

889
00:56:42,382 --> 00:56:43,483
Shouldn't we,

890
00:56:43,517 --> 00:56:45,686
by giving him
the full benefit

891
00:56:45,719 --> 00:56:48,322
of the rights that define
our system of government,

892

show this man who we are?

893
00:56:50,791 --> 00:56:53,594
Who we are.

894
00:56:53,627 --> 00:56:57,898
Is that not the greatest weapon
we have in this Cold War?

895
00:56:57,931 --> 00:57:00,901
Will we stand by our cause
less resolutely

896
00:57:00,934 --> 00:57:02,869
than he stands by his?

01:03:44,437 --> 01:03:46,806
because they still don't want
to acknowledge Abel as a Soviet citizen,

963
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,975
much less a Soviet spy. So...

964
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:52,012
Lot of fiction going on.

965
01:03:52,045 --> 01:03:54,280
Yes, sir, but to what end?

966
01:03:54,314 --> 01:03:56,750
They got our guy,
our spy pilot.

967
01:03:56,783 --> 01:03:57,984
We've got their guy.

968
01:04:00,954 --> 01:04:04,224
Prisoner exchange,
I think that's what they're after.

969
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:06,893
Which could hardly be
a surprise to you, Counselor.

970
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:09,863
It's an eventuality
that I think you foresaw.

971
01:04:09,896 --> 01:04:13,066
Yes, I sure did,
and I'm so rarely right.

972
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:16,202
Well, congratulations.
Red letter day.

973
01:04:16,236 --> 01:04:20,306
Now, we have our man
over there. Powers.

974
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:24,277
Good man, but with
a head full of classified information.

975
01:04:24,310 --> 01:04:26,946
Abel has a head
full of classified information, too,

976
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:28,948
but he hasn't
given us a lick.

977
01:04:28,982 --> 01:04:30,784
And, sir, take it from me,
he won't.

978
01:04:30,817 --> 01:04:33,186
Yes, we know that,
but the Russians don't.

979
01:04:33,219 --> 01:04:36,089
They want their man back
before he cracks.

980
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:39,059
And we want Powers back
for the same reasons.

981
01:04:42,395 --> 01:04:44,764
I think
you are saying, sir,

982
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:47,233
that there might be
a happy ending for everyone.

983
01:04:47,267 --> 01:04:50,236
Yes, if we, um,
indulge their fiction.

984
01:04:58,411 --> 01:05:00,847
We want you
to negotiate the swap

985
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,048
because you're
a private citizen,

986
01:05:02,082 --> 01:05:04,250
so it's not
governments talking.

987
01:05:04,284 --> 01:05:06,986
They don't acknowledge
Abel as a Soviet citizen,

988
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:10,790
and we don't acknowledge East Germany
as a sovereign country.

989
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:12,092
We haven't
recognized East Berlin

990
01:05:12,125 --> 01:05:14,861
since it was annexed
by the Soviets in '45.

991
01:05:14,894 --> 01:05:18,098
So I act as a negotiator,
representing...

992
01:05:18,131 --> 01:05:19,966
You're not
representing anybody.

993
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:21,039
Not a government official.

994
01:05:21,067 --> 01:05:23,236
You have no
official standing.

995
01:05:23,269 --> 01:05:25,271
So, some fiction
on our side as well.

996
01:05:25,305 --> 01:05:26,606
Correct.

997
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:30,009
Which means, of course,
you can't rely on any acknowledgment

998
01:05:30,043 --> 01:05:32,812
or help if things go south.

999
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:34,914
CIA can't be responsible.

1000
01:05:34,948 --> 01:05:36,249
We can't be embarrassed.

1001
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:41,321
Where do they want this
negotiation to take place?

1002
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:42,922
There.

1003
01:05:42,956 --> 01:05:44,157
"There"?

1004
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:45,358
East Berlin.

1005
01:05:47,961 --> 01:05:50,130
Well, isn't East Berlin
getting rather...

1006
01:05:50,163 --> 01:05:52,365
Oh, yes, the place
is getting complicated.

1007
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:55,401
Yeah, complicated.

1008
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:01,875
The Soviet side has been setting up
checkpoints for the past few months

1009
01:06:01,908 --> 01:06:04,210
to try to stop people
hemorrhaging to the Western sectors,

1010
01:06:04,244 --> 01:06:06,079
and it hasn't worked.

1011
01:06:06,112 --> 01:06:07,914
We have intelligence
to suggest

1012
01:06:07,947 --> 01:06:10,083
that they may go
one step further

1013
01:06:10,116 --> 01:06:12,218
and wall off
the entire Eastern sector.

1014
01:06:18,091 --> 01:06:20,326
Okay, that's it
in a nutshell.

1015
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:23,029
The decision
is entirely yours.

1016
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:26,132
You need time
to kick it around.

1017
01:06:32,105 --> 01:06:34,340
No.

1018
01:06:34,374 --> 01:06:35,475
No, I don't.

1019
01:06:35,508 --> 01:06:38,411
Well, fine. Fine.

1020
01:06:38,444 --> 01:06:41,014
Best that this all
remains confidential.

1021
01:06:41,047 --> 01:06:46,119
Let's not discuss any of this with, uh,
Mary or with anyone else.

1022
01:06:46,152 --> 01:06:48,288
Share the correspondence
only with us.

1023
01:06:48,321 --> 01:06:50,156
Let us know what they want to do
and when.

1024
01:06:50,190 --> 01:06:53,126
I've got no client,
no wife, no country.

1025
01:06:53,159 --> 01:06:56,229
Don't know what I'm doing
or when or who for.

1026
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:57,997
You're doing it
for your country,

1027
01:06:58,031 --> 01:07:00,033
but your country
doesn't know that yet.

1028
01:07:00,066 --> 01:07:03,169
What about my client,
the other person in this equation? My guy?

1029
01:07:03,203 --> 01:07:05,071
Your guy?
You mean the Russian?

1030
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:06,973
He's not your guy anymore,
Counselor.

1031
01:07:07,006 --> 01:07:10,043
Your guy is
Francis Gary Powers now.

1032
01:07:10,076 --> 01:07:12,946
What do I tell
Rudolf Abel?

1033
01:07:12,979 --> 01:07:14,347
Tell him not to drop dead.

1034
01:09:07,327 --> 01:09:08,394
Professor?

1035
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:15,301
Professor?

1036
01:09:16,302 --> 01:09:18,271
Papa went to university.

1037
01:09:18,304 --> 01:09:20,473
You shouldn't be here,
Frederic.

1038
01:09:20,506 --> 01:09:22,375
They're having
classes today?

1039
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:24,644
He went to see.
That's where he goes.

1040
01:09:24,677 --> 01:09:26,245
What are you doing here?

1041
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:28,281
I came to get you
and your father.

1042
01:09:28,314 --> 01:09:30,316
You have to come with me.
You might not get out tomorrow.

1043
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:31,551
Just... Just leave?

1044
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:34,020
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, leave.
Right now.

1045
01:10:05,184 --> 01:10:07,553
Go back. Go back.

1046
01:10:07,587 --> 01:10:10,123
I'll be okay, I'm American.
Go back.

1047
01:10:10,156 --> 01:10:12,392
Go back to your father's.
We'll find another way. Go.

1048
01:10:18,231 --> 01:10:19,232
Hey!

1049
01:10:19,599 --> 01:10:21,200
So, hi.

1050
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:26,305
Papers, please.

1051
01:10:26,339 --> 01:10:28,441
<i>Ich bin Student</i>
Frederic Pryor.

1052
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:30,643
Yes,
<i>Student.

1053
01:10:41,621 --> 01:10:44,157
My name's Frederic Pryor.
I'm an economics student.

1054
01:10:46,259 --> 01:10:50,329
See?
It's my dissertation.
My thesis.

1055
01:10:52,432 --> 01:10:53,900
You see? Look, look.

1056
01:10:53,933 --> 01:10:57,537
Look "The foreign trade system
of the European Communist nations." Huh?

1057
01:11:02,708 --> 01:11:04,477
It was a lot of work.

1058
01:11:11,651 --> 01:11:14,353
No, that's my only copy.

1059
01:11:15,721 --> 01:11:17,390
No!

1060
01:11:19,592 --> 01:11:21,194
<i>Tell me something.

1061
01:11:21,227 --> 01:11:23,296
It came up
at the last minute.

1062
01:11:23,329 --> 01:11:25,631
They have offices
in London.

1063
01:11:25,665 --> 01:11:28,634
These clients.
Not my idea.

1064
01:11:28,668 --> 01:11:31,304
Scotland, this
fishing expedition.

1065
01:11:31,337 --> 01:11:33,539
What kind of
fishing trip, Jim?

1066
01:11:33,573 --> 01:11:36,309
Salmon fishing.

1067
01:11:36,342 --> 01:11:38,382
Just tell me that you're
not gonna be in any danger,

1068
01:11:38,411 --> 01:11:39,745
that this is
just a routine business trip,

1069
01:11:39,779 --> 01:11:41,481
and I won't worry.

1070
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:43,483
I need my passport.

1071
01:11:48,621 --> 01:11:50,289
Just give me something
to hold on to.

1072
01:11:50,323 --> 01:11:51,724
I don't even care
if it's the truth.

1073
01:11:53,759 --> 01:11:55,428
I'm doing this for us.

1074
01:12:18,851 --> 01:12:20,820
Mr. Michener, here,
is your Berlin escort.

1075
01:12:20,853 --> 01:12:23,656
He's an attache
with the U.S. embassy.

1076
01:12:23,689 --> 01:12:26,292
- So, it's gotten goddamn complicated.
Uh-huh.

1077
01:12:26,325 --> 01:12:27,693
As you know,
the last letter from Mrs. Abel,

1078
01:12:27,727 --> 01:12:29,829
whoever she is, talks about
a lawyer in East Berlin,

1079
01:12:29,862 --> 01:12:32,331
Mr. Vogel, whoever he is,
representing her interests, she says.

1080
01:12:32,365 --> 01:12:33,733
Yeah, Vogel says

1081
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:35,668
he's gone to the Russian
embassy in East Berlin

1082
01:12:35,701 --> 01:12:38,337
and they may be ready
to trade Abel for Powers.

1083
01:12:38,371 --> 01:12:40,273
But no one knows who's who,

1084
01:12:40,306 --> 01:12:41,541
but essentially they're all Russian,
right?

1085
01:12:41,574 --> 01:12:44,377
Well, Soviet.
Well, we think so.

1086
01:12:44,410 --> 01:12:46,579
What do you mean?
Could we turn up the heat in here?

1087
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:50,816
There's a wrinkle.

1088
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:53,286
They might try
to throw you a curveball.

1089
01:12:53,319 --> 01:12:56,289
Try and get you to accept
another prisoner other than Powers.

1090
01:12:56,322 --> 01:12:57,657
Another American?

1091
01:12:57,690 --> 01:13:00,826
The, uh, East German Stasi
picked up an American student.

1092
01:13:00,860 --> 01:13:02,061
Frederic Pryor.

1093
01:13:02,094 --> 01:13:04,664
Uh, the kid they found on the wrong
side of the Wall.

1094
01:13:04,697 --> 01:13:06,465
He's a grad student
out of Yale.

1095
01:13:06,499 --> 01:13:08,534
- Came over here to study economics.
Mmm-hmm.

1096
01:13:08,568 --> 01:13:12,405
So, they're making noises
about trying this kid for espionage.

1097
01:13:12,438 --> 01:13:14,874
Grave offense, capital crime.
Well.

1098
01:13:14,907 --> 01:13:19,645
Vogel got in touch with us,
said he represents Pryor.

1099
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:24,617
Wait a minute. Vogel represents Mrs. Abel
and this... This kid?

1100
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:26,319
Yeah, he's busy.

1101
01:13:27,453 --> 01:13:28,521
Well, so,
what is he?

1102
01:13:28,554 --> 01:13:30,890
Vogel, is he, uh,
East German or is he Russian?

1103
01:13:30,923 --> 01:13:33,593
Well, try to figure it out
when you meet him.

1104
01:13:33,626 --> 01:13:35,895
At Russian embassy,
East Berlin, noon tomorrow.

1105
01:13:35,928 --> 01:13:38,631
Hoffman will show you
how to get there.

1106
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:40,733
Wait, show me how to get there?
I'm gonna have an escort.

1107
01:13:40,766 --> 01:13:42,602
Right?

1108
01:13:42,635 --> 01:13:44,737
Well, that was the plan
but like I said, there's a wrinkle.

1109
01:13:44,770 --> 01:13:47,506
I won't be taking you.
Decision's been made.

1110
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:50,309
No U.S. government personnel are to
cross the border until further notice.

1111
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:51,644
How come?
It's too dangerous.

1112
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:53,512
Yeah, the East Germans
grabbed this kid.

1113
01:13:53,546 --> 01:13:57,483
There's a degree of impunity
that we had not anticipated.

1114
01:13:57,516 --> 01:14:00,486
The point is that the East German agenda
and the Russian agenda

1115
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:01,921
may not be
the same thing.

1116
01:14:01,954 --> 01:14:03,823
Try and figure it out
and act accordingly.

1117
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:05,658
And try to make a deal.
Powers for Abel.

1118
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:08,594
Well, what about this
college kid, Pryor?

1119
01:14:08,628 --> 01:14:11,430
Mmm-mmm.
Don't fall for that.

1120
01:14:11,464 --> 01:14:12,531
We can get him out
another time.

1121
01:14:12,565 --> 01:14:13,766
Powers is the whole
ball game.

1122
01:14:36,822 --> 01:14:38,524
Where's your room?

1123
01:14:39,525 --> 01:14:40,685
I'll be staying
at the Hilton.

1124
01:14:42,928 --> 01:14:43,928
It's not far.

1125
01:14:45,998 --> 01:14:48,567
This is a number here
in West Berlin.

1126
01:14:48,601 --> 01:14:49,961
Memorize it and
give it back to me.

1127
01:14:51,604 --> 01:14:52,838
No, no. I...
I mean, now.

1128
01:14:55,574 --> 01:14:57,576
The Soviets keep cutting
the international lines

1129
01:14:57,610 --> 01:14:59,845
but local calls
are okay.

1130
01:14:59,879 --> 01:15:01,714
Someone will pick up
day and night.

1131
01:15:10,556 --> 01:15:13,893
Now, this docket attached to your passport
will serve as your ticket

1132
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:15,828
into and out of
the Eastern Soviet sector.

1133
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:19,810
The meeting with Vogel
is set for noon tomorrow.

1134
01:15:26,572 --> 01:15:28,474
There are only a few routes
left to the East.

1135
01:15:28,507 --> 01:15:30,710
You take the S-Bahn, the station we showed
you on the way in.

1136
01:15:30,743 --> 01:15:33,012
You're gonna get off
at the Friedrichstrasse station here

1137
01:15:33,045 --> 01:15:35,948
and walk to the Soviet embassy
on Unter den Linden here.

1138
01:15:35,981 --> 01:15:38,617
Look at the map now.
You shouldn't take it with you.

1139
01:15:38,651 --> 01:15:40,753
You're looking at a map,
you're an American, you're a spy.

1140
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:42,788
You could
well be detained.

1141
01:15:42,822 --> 01:15:44,890
Just avoid interacting
with people generally.

1142
01:15:44,924 --> 01:15:47,860
You don't...
You don't belong, so don't stick out.

1143
01:15:47,893 --> 01:15:49,995
Food is scarce over there
and things have started to fall apart.

1144
01:15:50,029 --> 01:15:51,230
There are gangs,

1145
01:15:51,263 --> 01:15:54,533
and rule of law is less firmly
established over there.

1146
01:15:54,567 --> 01:15:56,569
And definitely stay away
from the Wall.

1147
01:15:56,602 --> 01:15:57,770
On their side,
there's a line

1148
01:15:57,803 --> 01:15:58,838
cleared of buildings
along the Wall.

1149
01:15:58,871 --> 01:16:00,573
They call it
the "Death Line."

1150
01:16:00,606 --> 01:16:02,508
Cross it and
you'll be shot.

1151
01:16:02,541 --> 01:16:04,877
Is there any outcome here
where I'm not either detained or shot?

1152
01:16:04,910 --> 01:16:07,513
Don't worry too much
about what Michener said.

1153
01:16:07,546 --> 01:16:09,582
No, I'm worried about
what you're saying.

1154
01:16:09,615 --> 01:16:11,617
This kid, Pryor,

1155
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:13,052
that the East Germans have,
how old is he?

1156
01:16:13,085 --> 01:16:15,488
Twenty-five. Why?

1157
01:16:15,521 --> 01:16:16,689
Same age as Dougie.

1158
01:16:19,024 --> 01:16:20,526
Who?

1159
01:16:20,559 --> 01:16:22,027
Eh, an associate of mine.

1160
01:16:24,497 --> 01:16:25,631
Frederic Pryor.

1161
01:18:02,828 --> 01:18:03,963
Okay, okay, okay.

1162
01:18:51,777 --> 01:18:52,912
<i>Danke.

1163
01:19:50,069 --> 01:19:55,841
So, we apologize
if this offends.

1164
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:02,948
Uh...
Coat?

1165
01:20:22,201 --> 01:20:23,202
Okay.

1166
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:19,825
Do you understand English?
Yes, sir.

1167
01:21:19,858 --> 01:21:21,960
I'm James Donovan.
I'm here to meet a Mr. Vogel.

1168
01:21:21,994 --> 01:21:24,096
Mr. Vogel.
He doesn't work here.

1169
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:26,049
I'm just supposed to meet him.
That's all I know.

1170
01:21:49,421 --> 01:21:51,056
Mr. Donovan!

1171
01:21:51,924 --> 01:21:53,258
So we finally meet you.

1172
01:21:55,427 --> 01:21:57,062
I'm Helen Abel.

1173
01:21:57,096 --> 01:21:58,397
How is our husband?
Oh. He's fine.

1174
01:21:58,430 --> 01:21:59,898
How is my Rudolf?

1175
01:21:59,932 --> 01:22:01,867
As good as
can be expected.

1176
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:04,403
And we will
get him back, yes?

1177
01:22:04,436 --> 01:22:06,872
This is our daughter.
How do you do?

1178
01:22:07,272 --> 01:22:08,272
Lydia.

1179
01:22:08,907 --> 01:22:10,109
Are you Mr. Vogel?

1180
01:22:11,043 --> 01:22:12,377
No, no, no!

1181
01:22:12,411 --> 01:22:14,146
I'm not Vogel.

1182
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:15,347
I'm cousin Drews.

1183
01:22:17,282 --> 01:22:19,151
This is Rudolf's
beloved cousin Drews.

1184
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:21,386
Yes, cousin Drews.
I am cousin Drews.

1185
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:23,122
Cousin Drews, yes.

1186
01:22:23,155 --> 01:22:24,189
I'm Helen Abel.

1187
01:22:28,327 --> 01:22:29,394
When will you see him?

1188
01:22:31,163 --> 01:22:33,165
When will your government
release him?

1189
01:22:33,198 --> 01:22:35,167
I'm a little,
uh, lost here.

1190
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,069
I'm supposed to meet
a Mr. Vogel.

1191
01:22:37,102 --> 01:22:39,204
Oh, Mr. Vogel
is our lawyer.

1192
01:22:39,238 --> 01:22:43,175
We were supposed to negotiate,
uh, the exchange.

1193
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:45,978
To bring Rudolf here?
Yes, yes, to bring him here.

1194
01:22:46,011 --> 01:22:48,847
But it doesn't happen unilaterally,
do you understand?

1195
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:50,382
It has to be
an exchange.

1196
01:22:54,019 --> 01:22:55,187
Not here?

1197
01:23:02,294 --> 01:23:03,328
Shh.

1198
01:23:05,397 --> 01:23:07,199
Shh. Shh.

1199
01:23:15,507 --> 01:23:17,109
Mr. Donovan?

1200
01:23:17,142 --> 01:23:18,277
Mr. Vogel.

1201
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:20,212
No, no, no.
Goodness.

1202
01:23:20,245 --> 01:23:22,347
My name is Schischkin.
Ivan Schischkin.

1203
01:23:22,381 --> 01:23:24,449
I'm the second secretary
of the Soviet embassy.

1204
01:23:25,617 --> 01:23:28,987
It wouldn't be appropriate
for Mr. Vogel to join us.

1205
01:23:29,021 --> 01:23:31,190
He is a German national.

1206
01:23:31,223 --> 01:23:33,425
So you aren't here to...

1207
01:23:33,458 --> 01:23:37,029
To facilitate this meeting.

1208
01:23:37,062 --> 01:23:40,132
Uh, perhaps Mrs. Abel

1209
01:23:40,165 --> 01:23:42,334
would like to compose
herself privately?

1210
01:23:42,367 --> 01:23:45,337
And let Mr. Donovan
and myself to talk?

1211
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:48,440
Thank you.

1212
01:23:58,350 --> 01:24:01,053
So, I'm confused.
Yes.

1213
01:24:01,086 --> 01:24:02,521
Uh, I don't care
who I talk to

1214
01:24:02,554 --> 01:24:06,024
if it's about
an exchange of personnel.

1215
01:24:06,058 --> 01:24:08,026
Are you the person
to talk to?

1216
01:24:08,060 --> 01:24:10,996
Yes, yes, yes, of course.
Uh, we should talk.

1217
01:24:11,029 --> 01:24:13,265
Please, have a seat,
Mr. Donovan.

1218
01:24:14,967 --> 01:24:17,169
Uh, how did you arrive
to the Eastern sector?

1219
01:24:17,202 --> 01:24:18,270
The train.
The S-Bahn.

1220
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:20,072
Ah, and you were alone?

1221
01:24:20,105 --> 01:24:21,540
Yeah.

1222
01:24:21,573 --> 01:24:24,943
And you are
credentialed?

1223
01:24:24,977 --> 01:24:26,945
Now, you must know
about me, sir.

1224
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:28,480
I'm a private citizen.

1225
01:24:28,513 --> 01:24:30,482
I'm a lawyer in Brooklyn
in the United States,

1226
01:24:30,515 --> 01:24:33,151
and I've taken time
out of my busy schedule

1227
01:24:33,185 --> 01:24:35,954
to help my client,
Rudolf Abel.

1228
01:24:35,988 --> 01:24:40,025
I'm authorized to arrange
an exchange of Abel

1229
01:24:40,058 --> 01:24:42,494
for Francis Gary Powers.

1230
01:24:42,527 --> 01:24:45,397
This is a full
pardon of Abel

1231
01:24:45,430 --> 01:24:47,750
that will be signed
when the exchange actually takes place.

1232
01:24:49,067 --> 01:24:50,435
This is the only
reason I'm here.

1233
01:24:50,469 --> 01:24:53,238
I hope and expect to make
this arrangement quickly.

1234
01:24:54,306 --> 01:24:56,341
Abel for Francis
Gary Powers

1235
01:24:58,277 --> 01:25:00,012
and Frederic Pryor.

1236
01:25:02,281 --> 01:25:04,283
Mmm, we don't have Pryor.

1237
01:25:04,316 --> 01:25:06,285
No? You don't?

1238
01:25:08,587 --> 01:25:11,256
I've heard of Pryor,
but he's held

1239
01:25:11,290 --> 01:25:14,426
by the German
Democratic Republic,

1240
01:25:14,459 --> 01:25:17,296
not by the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics.

1241
01:25:18,230 --> 01:25:21,199
Well, I'll tell you
the first problem.

1242
01:25:21,233 --> 01:25:24,236
The names of your countries
are too long.

1243
01:25:24,269 --> 01:25:27,339
Yes, yes.

1244
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:30,409
If we release Powers,

1245
01:25:30,442 --> 01:25:32,411
it is only to
promote a goodwill

1246
01:25:32,444 --> 01:25:33,578
between our countries.

1247
01:25:35,347 --> 01:25:37,983
So, it cannot be
an exchange.

1248
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:42,421
Perhaps...

1249
01:25:42,454 --> 01:25:45,324
Perhaps you could
release Abel

1250
01:25:45,357 --> 01:25:47,292
as a token of goodwill
to our friends in Germany,

1251
01:25:47,326 --> 01:25:50,195
and then,
some months later,

1252
01:25:50,228 --> 01:25:52,631
we would release Powers.

1253
01:25:52,664 --> 01:25:55,100
There is an idea.
No. That just won't work for us at all.

1254
01:25:55,133 --> 01:25:57,436
See, we need this to be
an exchange.

1255
01:25:57,469 --> 01:25:59,237
You can call it
what you want,

1256
01:25:59,271 --> 01:26:01,106
but an exchange
it must be.

1257
01:26:01,139 --> 01:26:04,276
We can have Abel here
within 48 hours.

1258
01:26:04,309 --> 01:26:07,479
We need Powers
at the same time we give you Abel.

1259
01:26:09,681 --> 01:26:12,451
Hmm. This is...

1260
01:26:12,484 --> 01:26:16,388
Can we call this
the "impatient plan"?

1261
01:26:16,421 --> 01:26:18,256
Well, you can call it
whatever you want.

1262
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:23,261
I can relay your
impatient plan to Moscow,

1263
01:26:23,295 --> 01:26:24,162
see what they say...

1264
01:26:24,196 --> 01:26:27,532
But they will wonder
why so impatient.

1265
01:26:29,134 --> 01:26:30,535
Because I have a cold.

1266
01:26:30,569 --> 01:26:32,489
And I don't live in Berlin
and I want to go home.

1267
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:34,539
They will think,

1268
01:26:34,573 --> 01:26:37,409
"Well, the Americans
must have gotten

1269
01:26:37,442 --> 01:26:40,379
"all the information
that Abel had to give.

1270
01:26:40,412 --> 01:26:44,216
"And now they're impatient
to trade him,

1271
01:26:44,249 --> 01:26:47,285
"hoping to get in return
this man, Powers,

1272
01:26:47,319 --> 01:26:49,421
"that, perhaps,
has not yet given up

1273
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:51,456
"all the information
that he has to give."

1274
01:26:53,325 --> 01:26:55,460
This is not
an equitable trade, sir.

1275
01:26:56,728 --> 01:26:58,363
But what you're saying is,

1276
01:26:58,397 --> 01:27:00,399
if Powers has given up
everything he knows,

1277
01:27:00,432 --> 01:27:02,667
then Moscow would trade?

1278
01:27:02,701 --> 01:27:04,269
Why wouldn't they?

1279
01:27:05,437 --> 01:27:08,473
As for Abel, if he dies
in an American prison,

1280
01:27:08,507 --> 01:27:11,176
the next Russian operative
who gets caught

1281
01:27:11,209 --> 01:27:13,245
might think twice about
keeping his mouth shut.

1282
01:27:13,278 --> 01:27:18,617
And you never know.
Abel might want to see the sky again

1283
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:21,686
and decide to trade Russian
secrets for small American favors.

1284
01:27:25,524 --> 01:27:27,592
How can we know this?

1285
01:27:27,626 --> 01:27:31,296
We little men,
we just do our jobs.

1286
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:33,665
Like Lieutenant Powers.
He's just a pilot.

1287
01:27:36,501 --> 01:27:40,338
He was making photographs
from 70,000 feet

1288
01:27:40,372 --> 01:27:41,532
when he was shot
from the sky.

1289
01:27:42,507 --> 01:27:44,576
People in my country
consider this

1290
01:27:44,609 --> 01:27:46,445
an act of war.

1291
01:27:48,780 --> 01:27:51,550
We have to get off this
merry-go-round, sir.

1292
01:27:51,583 --> 01:27:53,351
The next mistake
our countries make

1293
01:27:53,385 --> 01:27:55,153
could be the last one.

1294
01:27:56,354 --> 01:27:58,623
We need to have
the conversation

1295
01:27:58,657 --> 01:28:00,358
our governments can't.

1296
01:28:05,664 --> 01:28:08,333
I will ask Moscow.

1297
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:10,335
Who knows
what they will say.

1298
01:28:12,270 --> 01:28:13,605
There are a lot of people,
Mr. Donovan,

1299
01:28:13,638 --> 01:28:17,742
who doesn't want this
exchange to ever take place.

1300
01:28:20,679 --> 01:28:24,216
Can you come back tomorrow
to discuss their answer?

1301
01:28:24,249 --> 01:28:25,250
Powers for Abel.

1302
01:28:25,283 --> 01:28:26,751
And Frederic Pryor.

1303
01:28:26,785 --> 01:28:28,286
As I said,

1304
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:30,489
Pryor is in the hands
of the organs of

1305
01:28:30,522 --> 01:28:32,724
State Security of the German
Democratic Republic.

1306
01:28:32,757 --> 01:28:35,327
I'm confident you can
make arrangements.

1307
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:37,662
I am merely a secretary

1308
01:28:37,696 --> 01:28:39,397
in the embassy
of foreign power.

1309
01:28:39,431 --> 01:28:40,765
Okay, okay.

1310
01:28:40,799 --> 01:28:44,402
You have to see Mr. Vogel.
I'll give you his address.

1311
01:28:44,436 --> 01:28:46,371
There actually is
a Mr. Vogel?

1312
01:28:46,404 --> 01:28:48,673
Why would you
imagine otherwise?

1313
01:28:48,707 --> 01:28:50,609
Uh, it's a short cab ride.

1314
01:28:51,810 --> 01:28:54,646
And please, Mr. Donovan,

1315
01:28:54,679 --> 01:28:56,515
wear an overcoat
in this weather.

1316
01:28:58,316 --> 01:28:59,518
I had mine
stolen from me.

1317
01:29:00,852 --> 01:29:02,521
What do you expect?

1318
01:29:02,554 --> 01:29:04,389
It was from
Saks Fifth Avenue.

1319
01:29:05,724 --> 01:29:06,724
Wasn't it?

1320
01:29:15,467 --> 01:29:16,801
Mr. Donovan.

1321
01:29:16,835 --> 01:29:18,270
Mr. Vogel.

1322
01:29:18,303 --> 01:29:20,272
Please come in.

1323
01:29:20,305 --> 01:29:21,406
<i>Danke.

1324
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:26,545
Sorry about the embassy.

1325
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:30,549
But the Soviets decided
not to host me.

1326
01:29:32,350 --> 01:29:34,252
Very irritating.

1327
01:29:34,286 --> 01:29:36,588
I am still trying
to grasp each party's...

1328
01:29:37,556 --> 01:29:39,324
Status?

1329
01:29:39,357 --> 01:29:42,460
Yes. And interest
in the proceedings.

1330
01:29:42,494 --> 01:29:43,562
Oh.

1331
01:29:43,595 --> 01:29:45,530
It's a new world.

1332
01:29:45,564 --> 01:29:47,599
All very disorienting,
isn't it?

1333
01:29:57,909 --> 01:29:59,644
Let me tell you
what I have to offer.

1334
01:30:02,514 --> 01:30:04,349
I'm a good friend...

1335
01:30:04,382 --> 01:30:06,418
"Friend."
No, he's older.

1336
01:30:06,451 --> 01:30:08,353
"Protege"?

1337
01:30:08,386 --> 01:30:10,855
Of the attorney general
of the German Democratic Republic.

1338
01:30:10,889 --> 01:30:12,290
Sit down, please.

1339
01:30:15,493 --> 01:30:17,362
This unfortunate,

1340
01:30:17,395 --> 01:30:19,598
Frederic Pryor,

1341
01:30:19,631 --> 01:30:22,534
he was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

1342
01:30:22,567 --> 01:30:25,637
But every accident,
properly viewed,

1343
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:27,772
is an opportunity,
isn't it, Mr. Donovan?

1344
01:30:27,806 --> 01:30:30,775
Well...
Your country refuses to recognize

1345
01:30:30,809 --> 01:30:33,478
the German
Democratic Republic.

1346
01:30:33,511 --> 01:30:35,513
They prefer to
make up stories

1347
01:30:35,547 --> 01:30:37,147
that the GDR doesn't
exist, for instance.

1348
01:30:39,517 --> 01:30:41,553
Sorry.

1349
01:30:41,586 --> 01:30:43,922
As a means of forcing your
government's recognition

1350
01:30:43,955 --> 01:30:46,491
of this real place, sir,

1351
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:48,393
in which you
find yourself,

1352
01:30:48,426 --> 01:30:49,894
the GDR,

1353
01:30:49,928 --> 01:30:52,397
the attorney general is
happy to negotiate with you

1354
01:30:52,430 --> 01:30:54,666
as a representative
of your government

1355
01:30:54,699 --> 01:30:55,934
for Mr. Pryor's return.

1356
01:30:55,967 --> 01:30:57,535
Mr. Vogel,
I'm not here

1357
01:30:57,569 --> 01:30:59,604
as a representative
of my government.

1358
01:31:02,674 --> 01:31:03,674
All right.

1359
01:31:06,678 --> 01:31:08,847
I think that's childish,
Mr. Donovan.

1360
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,516
Well, I... I have
no official status.

1361
01:31:11,549 --> 01:31:12,917
Fine.

1362
01:31:12,951 --> 01:31:15,754
You do not represent the USA,
I do not represent the GDR.

1363
01:31:15,787 --> 01:31:17,922
My client is Lydia Abel,
Rudolf's wife.

1364
01:31:17,956 --> 01:31:19,557
And I have also...

1365
01:31:19,591 --> 01:31:21,660
Lydia is the daughter.
Helen is the wife.

1366
01:31:27,599 --> 01:31:28,633
Well...

1367
01:31:30,502 --> 01:31:31,903
I am prepared to offer

1368
01:31:31,936 --> 01:31:34,806
Frederic Pryor's exchange
for Rudolf Abel's.

1369
01:31:36,541 --> 01:31:37,842
Then let's be clear.

1370
01:31:37,876 --> 01:31:39,978
We will produce
Rudolf Abel.

1371
01:31:40,011 --> 01:31:43,381
You will produce,
at the same time, the student, Pryor.

1372
01:31:43,915 --> 01:31:45,417
At the same time?

1373
01:31:45,450 --> 01:31:46,885
Absolutely.

1374
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:51,489
The exchange on offer
is a Russian at the end of his life

1375
01:31:53,792 --> 01:31:56,561
for an American student
at the start of his.

1376
01:32:03,501 --> 01:32:06,471
Schischkin? He's not
an embassy secretary.

1377
01:32:06,504 --> 01:32:09,474
Ivan Schischkin is the KGB's
chief in western Europe.

1378
01:32:09,507 --> 01:32:10,809
Well, whatever he is,

1379
01:32:10,842 --> 01:32:13,745
he's relaying our
proposal to Moscow

1380
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:16,748
and they'll decide.

1381
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:19,551
Could I borrow a coat?
I lost mine.

1382
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:21,019
How did you
lose your coat?

1383
01:32:21,052 --> 01:32:22,921
You know, spy stuff.

1384
01:32:25,523 --> 01:32:28,526
I'll get you another coat.
Good, because...

1385
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:30,729
So who is, uh...
Who is this Vogel?

1386
01:32:31,629 --> 01:32:33,431
Him, we don't know.

1387
01:32:33,465 --> 01:32:35,734
He might be what you
said he said he is.

1388
01:32:35,767 --> 01:32:37,001
Friend of
the attorney general.

1389
01:32:37,035 --> 01:32:40,739
Just some guy the GDR
tapped to handle this.

1390
01:32:40,772 --> 01:32:42,674
Sounds like
the East Germans

1391
01:32:42,707 --> 01:32:45,443
are fighting for
a place at our table.

1392
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:48,513
The GDR gets Abel back
for the Russians,

1393
01:32:48,546 --> 01:32:49,714
winning their respect...

1394
01:32:49,748 --> 01:32:52,517
And capturing the headlines
for their cause.

1395
01:32:52,550 --> 01:32:54,786
Which, of course,
puts East Germany on the map.

1396
01:32:54,819 --> 01:32:57,522
But we don't care
about their map.

1397
01:32:57,555 --> 01:32:59,023
Stick with
the Russians.

1398
01:32:59,057 --> 01:33:01,659
Stick with the Russians.
It's Powers for Abel.

1399
01:33:01,693 --> 01:33:04,829
So, does all this mean
this might actually happen?

1400
01:33:04,863 --> 01:33:06,731
Yeah, that's what
you seem to be telling me.

1401
01:33:06,765 --> 01:33:09,801
We'll put Abel on a plane,
he'll be here Friday.

1402
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:11,836
So, if Schischkin
gets the okay,

1403
01:33:11,870 --> 01:33:14,038
all that's left is the
mechanics of the trade.

1404
01:33:14,072 --> 01:33:15,907
How we swap our guy
for their guy.

1405
01:33:15,940 --> 01:33:18,042
Our "guys." Two guys.

1406
01:33:18,076 --> 01:33:20,545
Powers and Pryor.

1407
01:33:20,578 --> 01:33:23,515
No, now don't go
bleeding heart on me.

1408
01:33:23,548 --> 01:33:25,750
Powers is the whole
ball game.

1409
01:33:25,784 --> 01:33:27,552
Forget this
Ivy League boy,

1410
01:33:27,585 --> 01:33:29,687
who obviously thought
it was a good idea

1411
01:33:29,721 --> 01:33:32,090
to study Soviet
economics in Berlin

1412
01:33:32,123 --> 01:33:33,825
in the middle
of the Cold War.

1413
01:33:35,593 --> 01:33:36,928
Powers is who we need.

1414
01:33:37,962 --> 01:33:39,764
You don't even
like Powers.

1415
01:33:41,032 --> 01:33:43,701
Everybody hates Powers.

1416
01:33:43,735 --> 01:33:47,939
He didn't kill himself and he let the
commies parade him on television.

1417
01:33:47,972 --> 01:33:50,508
He's the most
hated man in America.

1418
01:33:50,542 --> 01:33:53,044
After Rudolf Abel,
maybe.

1419
01:33:53,077 --> 01:33:54,746
And me.

1420
01:34:03,755 --> 01:34:04,823
Now wake up!

1421
01:34:13,865 --> 01:34:15,733
I gotta sleep.

1422
01:34:15,767 --> 01:34:17,068
I just gotta sleep.

1423
01:34:20,772 --> 01:34:21,940
I told you,
you can sleep

1424
01:34:21,973 --> 01:34:23,808
once we talk
what we need to talk.

1425
01:34:23,842 --> 01:34:26,678
You must focus on me.

1426
01:34:26,711 --> 01:34:29,080
Your government doesn't care about you.
You know that.

1427
01:34:29,113 --> 01:34:30,315
Any of you.

1428
01:34:30,348 --> 01:34:34,018
You know that twelve
U-2 pilots incurred brain damage?

1429
01:34:34,052 --> 01:34:37,622
They're vegetables because of altitude,
insufficient oxygen.

1430
01:34:37,655 --> 01:34:39,624
But they keep you
flying, Gary.

1431
01:34:39,657 --> 01:34:41,726
You and your friends.

1432
01:34:41,759 --> 01:34:45,163
They gave you this.
A scratcher, yes?

1433
01:34:45,196 --> 01:34:47,966
Potassium cyanide.

1434
01:34:47,999 --> 01:34:50,935
Does that look like
they care about you?

1435
01:35:20,031 --> 01:35:23,601
What is the construction
of the destructor unit?

1436
01:35:23,635 --> 01:35:25,670
By what means
is this unit operated?

1437
01:35:25,703 --> 01:35:28,806
With what explosives
is the unit charged,

1438
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:30,675
and what destruction
is it capable of?

1439
01:35:31,242 --> 01:35:33,211
I don't know.

1440
01:35:33,244 --> 01:35:35,647
The pilots were never shown
any of the equipment.

1441
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:37,949
How wide far
can the radar

1442
01:35:37,982 --> 01:35:39,884
map an area during
an overflight?

1443
01:35:39,918 --> 01:35:40,919
I don't know,
I don't know!

1444
01:35:40,952 --> 01:35:44,923
Were you making
the overflight on April 9th

1445
01:35:44,956 --> 01:35:47,659
over the industrial area
and MiG bomber base

1446
01:35:47,692 --> 01:35:48,760
at Baranovichi?

1447
01:35:48,793 --> 01:35:50,695
I was not.

1448
01:35:50,728 --> 01:35:52,096
This was my
first overflight.

1449
01:35:52,130 --> 01:35:56,067
I need to know about
engine-out to glide ratio.

1450
01:35:56,100 --> 01:35:59,137
How the plane
gets so high.

1451
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:04,108
We know it reaches
altitude of 70,000 feet.

1452
01:36:04,142 --> 01:36:06,077
Gary, we know this.

1453
01:36:06,110 --> 01:36:08,713
And I need to know
where the planes have flown.

1454
01:36:08,746 --> 01:36:11,115
Where they
have flown, Gary.

1455
01:36:11,149 --> 01:36:12,817
And we must have
this talk now.

1456
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:17,956
Now.

1457
01:36:17,989 --> 01:36:20,658
And then you can
sleep a little.

1458
01:36:24,862 --> 01:36:26,664
<i>Sir, wake up.

1459
01:36:28,099 --> 01:36:29,099
Wake up, sir.

1460
01:36:31,970 --> 01:36:33,938
Sir, can you come with me, please?
Yeah.

1461
01:36:33,972 --> 01:36:36,007
We gotta move.
Yeah, of course.

1462
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:37,275
Can you come with me, please?
Yeah.

1463
01:36:37,308 --> 01:36:38,876
Okay.

1464
01:36:39,944 --> 01:36:41,746
Got your glasses?
Uh-huh.

1465
01:36:41,779 --> 01:36:45,016
What time is it?
It's late, but we need to talk,

1466
01:36:45,049 --> 01:36:46,649
and then we need to
get on a plane, okay?

1467
01:36:47,885 --> 01:36:49,988
Yeah.
Yep. Upsy-daisy!

1468
01:36:50,021 --> 01:36:51,923
Upsy-daisy.
That's right.

1469
01:36:51,956 --> 01:36:53,224
There we go.
Keep it moving.

1470
01:36:53,257 --> 01:36:54,726
Thank you.

1471
01:36:56,995 --> 01:36:58,696
Other way, other way.

1472
01:36:58,730 --> 01:36:59,764
There we go.

1473
01:36:59,797 --> 01:37:01,032
You say a plane?

1474
01:37:01,065 --> 01:37:02,934
This way, please.
Keep moving.

1475
01:37:02,967 --> 01:37:05,937
<i>So, I received
a favorable decision

1476
01:37:05,970 --> 01:37:08,039
<i>from Moscow
on your proposal

1477
01:37:08,072 --> 01:37:11,042
that we help our friends in the German
Democratic Republic

1478
01:37:11,309 --> 01:37:13,077
by exchanging

1479
01:37:13,111 --> 01:37:15,079
Mr. Powers
for Mr. Abel.

1480
01:37:17,081 --> 01:37:18,316
That's swell.

1481
01:37:18,349 --> 01:37:22,920
May I suggest the Glienicke Bridge
as a place of a swap?

1482
01:37:22,954 --> 01:37:24,222
Why not Checkpoint
Charlie?

1483
01:37:24,255 --> 01:37:26,924
We're not
looking for publicity.

1484
01:37:26,958 --> 01:37:28,893
The Glienicke Bridge
is very quiet,

1485
01:37:28,926 --> 01:37:30,194
especially early
in the morning.

1486
01:37:30,228 --> 01:37:32,997
Glienicke Bridge.
I'll run that by our side.

1487
01:37:33,031 --> 01:37:34,799
We can have Abel here
on Friday.

1488
01:37:34,832 --> 01:37:36,134
So, Saturday morning?

1489
01:37:36,167 --> 01:37:38,202
Always impatience, yeah?

1490
01:37:38,236 --> 01:37:39,871
I want to get home
and get into bed.

1491
01:37:39,904 --> 01:37:42,173
So, Saturday morning?

1492
01:37:42,206 --> 01:37:43,808
5:30?

1493
01:37:43,841 --> 01:37:45,343
All right.

1494
01:37:45,376 --> 01:37:47,078
We're done here.

1495
01:37:47,111 --> 01:37:48,346
This is a number,

1496
01:37:48,379 --> 01:37:51,816
in case anything
should come up.

1497
01:37:51,849 --> 01:37:52,950
All right.

1498
01:37:52,984 --> 01:37:54,919
Someone will answer
at any hour.

1499
01:37:56,020 --> 01:37:57,321
I don't expect
to use it.

1500
01:37:58,923 --> 01:38:01,225
Shall we toast
the arrangement?

1501
01:38:01,259 --> 01:38:02,794
Why not?

1502
01:38:04,395 --> 01:38:05,930
Armenian brandy.

1503
01:38:05,963 --> 01:38:07,732
Good bracer for your cold.
Thank you.

1504
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:10,101
Would you mind...

1505
01:38:10,134 --> 01:38:11,969
This is not part
of our business

1506
01:38:12,003 --> 01:38:14,238
but I'd like to ask you
a couple of questions.

1507
01:38:14,272 --> 01:38:15,973
You do not
have to answer.

1508
01:38:16,007 --> 01:38:17,208
I shall answer
what I know.

1509
01:38:18,209 --> 01:38:21,245
I like this guy,
your guy.

1510
01:38:21,279 --> 01:38:24,182
What happens to your guy
when he gets home?

1511
01:38:24,215 --> 01:38:26,217
Well, we have to make
a determination

1512
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:28,920
whether our guy
is now your guy.

1513
01:38:28,953 --> 01:38:30,822
Now, as I said
to you before,

1514
01:38:30,855 --> 01:38:32,090
he's acted
honorably.

1515
01:38:32,123 --> 01:38:33,858
He's still your guy,
believe me.

1516
01:38:33,891 --> 01:38:36,861
Of course you will
say that if it were true

1517
01:38:36,894 --> 01:38:39,097
and if it were
not true.

1518
01:38:39,130 --> 01:38:41,399
I guess it has
come down to that, huh?

1519
01:38:41,432 --> 01:38:43,134
Well, forgive me
for pushing,

1520
01:38:43,167 --> 01:38:46,003
but is he
in any danger

1521
01:38:46,037 --> 01:38:48,339
if the determination
is made?

1522
01:38:48,372 --> 01:38:50,808
Well, goodness.

1523
01:38:50,842 --> 01:38:53,411
As things are now,
everyone is in danger.

1524
01:38:53,444 --> 01:38:55,012
Cheers.

1525
01:38:55,046 --> 01:38:56,247
<i>Na zdorovie.

1526
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:11,095
There will be no exchange
on Glienicke Bridge.

1527
01:39:12,196 --> 01:39:14,132
Excuse me, sir.

1528
01:39:14,165 --> 01:39:16,200
There will be
no exchange.

1529
01:39:17,068 --> 01:39:18,936
Not for Frederic Pryor.

1530
01:39:18,970 --> 01:39:22,073
Mr. Vogel, I thought
yesterday we had agreed.

1531
01:39:22,106 --> 01:39:24,342
We agreed on an exchange,
Abel for Pryor.

1532
01:39:26,077 --> 01:39:29,213
Now I learn you are
a rug merchant

1533
01:39:29,247 --> 01:39:32,116
selling the same rug
to two customers.

1534
01:39:32,150 --> 01:39:35,019
Abel for Pryor you sell to us.
Yeah.

1535
01:39:35,052 --> 01:39:37,255
And Abel for Powers
you sell to the Soviets.

1536
01:39:37,288 --> 01:39:39,924
I'm not quite sure
what the problem is

1537
01:39:39,957 --> 01:39:43,161
if the arrangement satisfies
two parties or three or four.

1538
01:39:43,194 --> 01:39:44,328
What difference
does it make?

1539
01:39:44,362 --> 01:39:46,330
The arrangement does not
satisfy this party.

1540
01:39:51,202 --> 01:39:52,236
Now, Mr. Vogel, please...

1541
01:39:52,270 --> 01:39:55,206
Obviously you do not know
who you are dealing with.

1542
01:39:57,275 --> 01:39:59,911
Here's the interest
of the German Democratic Republic.

1543
01:40:01,212 --> 01:40:02,413
To deal with,

1544
01:40:02,446 --> 01:40:05,316
and to be seen to be dealing
with another sovereign power,

1545
01:40:05,349 --> 01:40:06,984
the United States.

1546
01:40:07,018 --> 01:40:09,086
An equal power.

1547
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:10,488
Instead you treat us
as stooges

1548
01:40:10,521 --> 01:40:12,490
for the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics.

1549
01:40:12,523 --> 01:40:14,926
Can we just call them the Russians?
It'll save time.

1550
01:40:16,394 --> 01:40:18,362
I have an appointment, sir.

1551
01:40:18,396 --> 01:40:20,164
I think it's you
who are wasting time.

1552
01:40:20,198 --> 01:40:22,233
Now, tell me if
I am describing this wrong.

1553
01:40:22,266 --> 01:40:24,001
You have a kid,
a university student,

1554
01:40:24,035 --> 01:40:25,369
someone you know
is not a spy,

1555
01:40:25,403 --> 01:40:26,904
who's no threat to you.

1556
01:40:26,938 --> 01:40:28,372
And in exchange
for this person

1557
01:40:28,406 --> 01:40:30,141
who is worthless to you,

1558
01:40:30,174 --> 01:40:32,343
you play an equal part
in an exchange

1559
01:40:32,376 --> 01:40:34,445
between the Russians
and the Americans.

1560
01:40:34,478 --> 01:40:38,983
And this is one transaction
between us and the two of you.

1561
01:40:39,016 --> 01:40:40,451
We're not trying to do
two things here, sir.

1562
01:40:40,484 --> 01:40:42,186
We're just doing one thing.
One, one, one.

1563
01:40:42,220 --> 01:40:47,291
It's hard for me to see how the
Republic of East German Democrats is being slighted.

1564
01:40:47,325 --> 01:40:50,194
You agreed with the Soviets
without consulting me.

1565
01:40:50,228 --> 01:40:52,163
Is this a negotiation
or a conspiracy?

1566
01:40:52,196 --> 01:40:53,097
For it to be
a conspiracy,

1567
01:40:53,130 --> 01:40:54,298
there would have to be
harm to you, sir.

1568
01:40:54,332 --> 01:40:57,268
There's just benefits here.
We're of agreeing interests.

1569
01:40:57,301 --> 01:40:59,237
No, you decide
they agree.

1570
01:41:00,238 --> 01:41:01,973
Where is your
appointment, sir?

1571
01:41:02,006 --> 01:41:03,407
In the West.
Ku'damm.

1572
01:41:03,441 --> 01:41:04,441
Good.

1573
01:41:15,586 --> 01:41:16,754
Look around you.

1574
01:41:16,787 --> 01:41:20,291
How does the Eastern sector
compare with the West? Hmm?

1575
01:41:22,326 --> 01:41:24,295
Our Russian friends
have decided that

1576
01:41:24,328 --> 01:41:26,264
we should not rebuild
our capital city.

1577
01:41:28,532 --> 01:41:32,036
But we live in this ruin
made by our Russian friends.

1578
01:41:32,069 --> 01:41:34,038
Go ahead, make your deal
with these Russians.

1579
01:41:34,071 --> 01:41:35,239
We won't be part of it.

1580
01:41:37,341 --> 01:41:38,542
There is no deal
without Pryor.

1581
01:41:38,576 --> 01:41:39,543
We are not
leaving him here.

1582
01:41:39,577 --> 01:41:41,579
Is this your position
or your government's?

1583
01:41:41,612 --> 01:41:45,383
Sir, I'm here.
I'm talking to you.

1584
01:41:45,416 --> 01:41:47,351
But you are not a representative
of your government.

1585
01:41:47,385 --> 01:41:50,087
You don't know who you are.
Neither do we.

1586
01:41:50,121 --> 01:41:52,423
You should be careful.
This is not Brooklyn, Mr. Donovan.

1587
01:42:00,097 --> 01:42:01,499
Look, sir.

1588
01:42:01,532 --> 01:42:03,367
You must know that
in every respect that matters,

1589
01:42:03,401 --> 01:42:05,569
I represent
my government.

1590
01:42:05,603 --> 01:42:07,104
You know who I am.

1591
01:42:08,239 --> 01:42:09,273
Do I?

1592
01:42:15,246 --> 01:42:17,048
Uh-oh.

1593
01:42:31,362 --> 01:42:34,198
Do you have
the proper papers?

1594
01:42:34,231 --> 01:42:37,101
Of course not.
It doesn't matter.

1595
01:42:37,134 --> 01:42:38,302
An American lawyer
like you

1596
01:42:38,336 --> 01:42:40,104
can talk your way
out of anything.

1597
01:42:40,137 --> 01:42:41,339
Can't you?

1598
01:43:24,148 --> 01:43:26,083
You go with him.

1599
01:43:26,117 --> 01:43:28,619
Why?
It's passport problem.

1600
01:43:28,652 --> 01:43:30,221
What... What problem?
What's the problem?

1601
01:43:30,254 --> 01:43:31,455
You go with him.

1602
01:43:34,358 --> 01:43:35,693
And remember,

1603
01:43:35,726 --> 01:43:37,495
we control the fate
of Frederic Pryor.

1604
01:45:22,366 --> 01:45:23,501
My God!

1605
01:45:59,036 --> 01:46:01,472
Yeah,
I'll start with some coffee, please.

1606
01:46:01,505 --> 01:46:03,674
Then I'll have
the Hilton combo

1607
01:46:03,707 --> 01:46:05,543
and the American
breakfast.

1608
01:46:05,576 --> 01:46:06,677
And coffee.

1609
01:46:06,710 --> 01:46:07,778
Both breakfasts?

1610
01:46:07,811 --> 01:46:09,346
Yeah, yeah.

1611
01:46:09,380 --> 01:46:10,581
One first or...

1612
01:46:10,614 --> 01:46:12,316
Both first, both.
Whenever they're ready.

1613
01:46:12,349 --> 01:46:14,318
And coffee.
Hmm.

1614
01:46:31,902 --> 01:46:33,671
You shouldn't be here.

1615
01:46:33,704 --> 01:46:34,872
Well, sometimes
in Germany,

1616
01:46:34,905 --> 01:46:36,774
you just want a big
American breakfast.

1617
01:46:40,844 --> 01:46:42,880
What happened?
Where were you last night?

1618
01:46:42,913 --> 01:46:45,883
Vogel arranged for me
to spend some time in the East.

1619
01:46:45,916 --> 01:46:47,484
Oh, Jesus.

1620
01:46:47,518 --> 01:46:48,752
Frankly, it's not
that much worse

1621
01:46:48,786 --> 01:46:50,621
than where you have me
here in the West.

1622
01:46:52,690 --> 01:46:56,360
So the Russians are fine
with the exchange,

1623
01:46:56,393 --> 01:46:58,896
but now Vogel is saying
that the East Germans won't do it.

1624
01:46:58,929 --> 01:46:59,929
We're not gonna
get Pryor.

1625
01:47:01,332 --> 01:47:03,334
Great, good.

1626
01:47:03,367 --> 01:47:05,369
So the Soviets are set.
We get Powers.

1627
01:47:05,402 --> 01:47:06,670
We get Powers.

1628
01:47:06,704 --> 01:47:08,706
Well done.

1629
01:47:08,739 --> 01:47:10,774
No, the East Germans
won't do it.

1630
01:47:10,808 --> 01:47:12,910
We won't get Pryor,
and that kid matters.

1631
01:47:12,943 --> 01:47:14,645
Every person matters.

1632
01:47:14,678 --> 01:47:17,715
Sure, that's why you tried.
That's why you tried.

1633
01:47:17,748 --> 01:47:19,783
Abel's on his way,
so we're all set for tomorrow morning.

1634
01:47:19,817 --> 01:47:22,386
Wait a minute.
Makes things simple.
Makes things simple.

1635
01:47:22,419 --> 01:47:24,688
We are not
getting the kid.

1636
01:47:24,722 --> 01:47:26,857
Yeah, I understand.
We're set.

1637
01:47:26,890 --> 01:47:28,690
We can ignore the message
we got this morning.

1638
01:47:30,494 --> 01:47:31,729
What message?

1639
01:47:31,762 --> 01:47:32,896
From the East Germans.

1640
01:47:32,930 --> 01:47:34,865
They called the number
I gave you.

1641
01:47:34,898 --> 01:47:37,401
They said they wanted
to speak to you today.

1642
01:47:37,434 --> 01:47:39,403
Vogel called?
No, um...

1643
01:47:39,436 --> 01:47:41,772
Office of, uh,
Harald Ott,

1644
01:47:41,805 --> 01:47:43,374
East German
attorney general.

1645
01:47:43,407 --> 01:47:44,875
Wanting what?
What does he want?

1646
01:47:44,908 --> 01:47:46,010
Well, to talk to you.

1647
01:47:46,043 --> 01:47:48,946
But it's okay,
I can't ask you to go back there.

1648
01:47:48,979 --> 01:47:51,582
And listen, you seem to be
persona non grata to some elements,

1649
01:47:51,615 --> 01:47:52,916
so we won't
push our luck.

1650
01:47:52,950 --> 01:47:54,952
So he wants to see me.

1651
01:47:54,985 --> 01:47:56,920
What time?

1652
01:47:56,954 --> 01:47:59,890
Oh, no, no. Now, listen.

1653
01:47:59,923 --> 01:48:01,959
You don't need to go.
In fact, you shouldn't go.

1654
01:48:01,992 --> 01:48:04,428
In fact, you can't go.

1655
01:48:04,461 --> 01:48:06,797
We're set with the Soviets.
We don't want to screw it up.

1656
01:48:06,830 --> 01:48:08,766
I'm not gonna screw it up.
You're not going!

1657
01:48:08,799 --> 01:48:10,367
Don't be a pain in the ass.

1658
01:48:10,401 --> 01:48:11,769
Oh, I ordered.

1659
01:48:11,802 --> 01:48:13,871
Enjoy your big
American breakfast.

1660
01:48:23,614 --> 01:48:25,549
I thought it should
be negotiated

1661
01:48:25,582 --> 01:48:27,785
at the highest level
as a courtesy to you.

1662
01:48:27,818 --> 01:48:29,620
I thank you, sir.

1663
01:48:31,855 --> 01:48:34,725
I don't know how things
became so confused.

1664
01:48:34,758 --> 01:48:37,561
Well, I guess sometimes
they just do.

1665
01:48:42,032 --> 01:48:43,634
For sake of clarity,

1666
01:48:43,667 --> 01:48:46,003
I say we are fully
prepared to exchange

1667
01:48:46,036 --> 01:48:50,741
the so-called student, Pryor,
for Rudolf Abel.

1668
01:48:50,774 --> 01:48:53,610
I understand from Mr. Vogel
that Pryor is very important to you.

1669
01:48:53,644 --> 01:48:55,012
Yes, but...

1670
01:48:55,045 --> 01:48:57,614
Ah, we'll do a memorandum
to that effect.

1671
01:48:58,982 --> 01:49:00,918
Oh, a memorandum.

1672
01:49:00,951 --> 01:49:04,421
Certainly, we commit
to a bi-lateral exchange.

1673
01:49:05,956 --> 01:49:10,494
Yes, yes, sure. I'm not sure
what that means but...

1674
01:49:10,527 --> 01:49:14,898
My country also insists
on Francis Gary Powers.

1675
01:49:14,932 --> 01:49:15,999
No!

1676
01:49:21,071 --> 01:49:24,742
This is how things
became so confused.

1677
01:49:24,775 --> 01:49:27,511
Powers. What use
is he, sir?

1678
01:49:27,544 --> 01:49:29,446
You want him back for
punitive reasons?

1679
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:30,681
What's done is done.

1680
01:49:30,714 --> 01:49:32,015
He has divulged
what he will divulge,

1681
01:49:32,049 --> 01:49:34,852
as no doubt
Abel has also.

1682
01:49:34,885 --> 01:49:39,656
We are offering instead
someone who you insist is innocent.

1683
01:49:39,690 --> 01:49:40,991
And this is right.

1684
01:49:41,024 --> 01:49:42,659
This is who
you should retrieve.

1685
01:49:43,093 --> 01:49:44,728
The future.

1686
01:49:44,762 --> 01:49:46,122
Look to the future.

1687
01:49:49,700 --> 01:49:50,768
Ott.

1688
01:49:53,604 --> 01:49:55,606
Ott.

1689
01:50:03,981 --> 01:50:05,983
I'm sorry. If you could
give me a moment, sir.

1690
01:50:25,969 --> 01:50:28,105
I'm very sorry, sir.
The attorney general regrets

1691
01:50:28,138 --> 01:50:30,808
that he had to leave
on urgent business.

1692
01:50:30,841 --> 01:50:34,077
He left?
Yes. Many apologies.

1693
01:50:34,111 --> 01:50:36,513
I've been waiting
for over an hour.

1694
01:50:36,547 --> 01:50:37,881
Very sorry, sir.

1695
01:50:40,117 --> 01:50:41,618
Young man.

1696
01:50:43,754 --> 01:50:44,855
Come here.

1697
01:50:46,623 --> 01:50:48,058
It's all right.
Come here.

1698
01:50:53,597 --> 01:50:55,833
Uh...
Take a seat.

1699
01:50:57,901 --> 01:50:59,870
Oh, come on, come on.
Sit down.

1700
01:51:04,041 --> 01:51:05,776
Do you like
your job here?

1701
01:51:06,643 --> 01:51:08,011
It's a very
good job, sir.

1702
01:51:08,045 --> 01:51:10,147
It must be.
Must be interesting.

1703
01:51:10,180 --> 01:51:11,615
Oh, yes, sir.

1704
01:51:11,648 --> 01:51:13,750
And important, too.

1705
01:51:13,784 --> 01:51:16,753
And your English is...
Is good.

1706
01:51:16,787 --> 01:51:18,789
Yes, I hesitate to say
it's excellent.

1707
01:51:18,822 --> 01:51:19,690
But it's excellent,
sir.

1708
01:51:19,723 --> 01:51:21,758
Good, good.
Good.

1709
01:51:21,792 --> 01:51:24,695
See, I just lost my
negotiating partner,

1710
01:51:24,728 --> 01:51:26,763
and I need
somebody to talk to,

1711
01:51:26,797 --> 01:51:28,732
and you seem like
a reasonable young man.

1712
01:51:30,033 --> 01:51:31,668
Can I talk to you?

1713
01:51:33,003 --> 01:51:34,003
Uh...

1714
01:51:34,838 --> 01:51:36,073
It's all right.

1715
01:51:36,106 --> 01:51:37,875
It's all right.
I just...

1716
01:51:39,977 --> 01:51:42,045
I just need you to give
a message to your boss.

1717
01:51:44,615 --> 01:51:46,175
But it has to be
very, very, very clear.

1718
01:51:47,651 --> 01:51:48,719
You understand?

1719
01:51:49,987 --> 01:51:53,123
Yes, sir. But perhaps
you should wait until he...

1720
01:51:53,156 --> 01:51:56,627
No, no. The thing is,
I have this cold and I wanna get home

1721
01:51:57,160 --> 01:51:59,029
and get in bed.

1722
01:52:00,797 --> 01:52:02,199
Can you give him
the message?

1723
01:52:02,232 --> 01:52:03,634
Certainly.

1724
01:52:05,636 --> 01:52:06,904
Well, this is
the message.

1725
01:52:08,972 --> 01:52:11,642
"There is no deal for
Abel unless we get Powers and Pryor."

1726
01:52:13,176 --> 01:52:15,646
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.

1727
01:52:15,679 --> 01:52:16,847
It's arranged for
tomorrow morning.

1728
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:19,216
It will not happen
unless we get two men.

1729
01:52:19,249 --> 01:52:20,951
Those two men.

1730
01:52:20,984 --> 01:52:22,653
Two, two, two.
Yes, sir.

1731
01:52:23,253 --> 01:52:26,023
If there is no deal,

1732
01:52:26,056 --> 01:52:27,691
your boss must tell
the Soviets.

1733
01:52:29,226 --> 01:52:30,961
He has to tell
the Soviets

1734
01:52:30,994 --> 01:52:33,030
that they are not
getting Rudolf Abel.

1735
01:52:35,232 --> 01:52:36,934
Yes, sir.

1736
01:52:39,870 --> 01:52:41,138
Oh, and tell him this.

1737
01:52:42,906 --> 01:52:45,876
That so far, Abel has been
a good soldier,

1738
01:52:45,909 --> 01:52:47,978
but he thinks
he's going home.

1739
01:52:50,180 --> 01:52:52,783
If we had to tell him
that he's not going home,

1740
01:52:52,816 --> 01:52:54,084
that the Soviets
don't even want him,

1741
01:52:54,117 --> 01:52:55,719
that he's never
going home...

1742
01:52:55,752 --> 01:52:57,888
Well, I imagine his
behavior might change.

1743
01:52:59,957 --> 01:53:02,826
And who will be held
responsible for that?

1744
01:53:06,697 --> 01:53:07,898
That's a long message.

1745
01:53:07,931 --> 01:53:09,967
Uh, did you get it all?

1746
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,169
Yes, sir. Got it.
Good.

1747
01:53:13,837 --> 01:53:14,972
You're a good man.

1748
01:53:16,039 --> 01:53:17,040
Oh...

1749
01:53:17,941 --> 01:53:19,676
And also tell him

1750
01:53:19,710 --> 01:53:20,877
there's no deal
unless we hear

1751
01:53:20,911 --> 01:53:22,746
before the end of
business today.

1752
01:53:22,779 --> 01:53:24,047
He has the number.

1753
01:53:24,081 --> 01:53:26,083
If the exchange
isn't gonna happen,

1754
01:53:26,116 --> 01:53:28,151
no reason for everybody
to get up first thing in the morning.

1755
01:53:28,185 --> 01:53:31,888
No, sir,
that would be pointless.

1756
01:53:31,922 --> 01:53:34,725
You're kidding me!
You're kidding me!

1757
01:53:34,758 --> 01:53:36,927
Not really.
I need some change.

1758
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:39,196
This is exactly
what you weren't supposed to do.

1759
01:53:39,229 --> 01:53:42,032
My instructions were
to feel out the situation.

1760
01:53:42,065 --> 01:53:44,868
Your instructions
were to get Powers, not Pryor.

1761
01:53:44,901 --> 01:53:47,137
That was not the original deal.
You fouled it all up!

1762
01:53:47,170 --> 01:53:49,806
How do you know?
I feel pretty good about it.

1763
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:51,208
You fucked it all up!

1764
01:53:51,241 --> 01:53:53,043
Oh, don't worry.

1765
01:53:53,076 --> 01:53:55,178
I think it's
gonna be fine.

1766
01:53:55,212 --> 01:53:56,947
How do you know?
You don't know that.

1767
01:54:01,084 --> 01:54:03,186
United States.
New York, New York.

1768
01:54:03,220 --> 01:54:04,755
<i>Danke.

1769
01:54:05,822 --> 01:54:08,792
Look, this whole thing

1770
01:54:08,825 --> 01:54:11,728
has been to feel me out.

1771
01:54:11,762 --> 01:54:14,064
Would I swap one for one
and which one?

1772
01:54:15,132 --> 01:54:17,100
But I said
"No, two for one."

1773
01:54:17,134 --> 01:54:19,069
So they know
where we stand.

1774
01:54:19,102 --> 01:54:21,138
Yeah, what if they think
about it and say, uh...

1775
01:54:21,171 --> 01:54:23,306
"Forget it! You keep our guy,
we keep your guys"?

1776
01:54:26,243 --> 01:54:28,345
Well, then I have
fucked it all up.

1777
01:54:28,378 --> 01:54:30,881
Hey, honey! It's me.

1778
01:54:30,914 --> 01:54:33,784
Yeah. The fishing's
been great.

1779
01:54:35,786 --> 01:54:37,120
I'm in London,

1780
01:54:37,154 --> 01:54:39,154
just for one more meeting,
then I'm on my way home.

1781
01:54:40,390 --> 01:54:43,860
Yeah, yeah, I remember
that marmalade.

1782
01:54:43,894 --> 01:54:45,996
It's that shop
right by Regent's Park.

1783
01:54:47,297 --> 01:54:49,232
All right, I will
if I have the time.

1784
01:54:49,266 --> 01:54:51,034
Hey, can I say
hi to Roger?

1785
01:54:52,269 --> 01:54:53,937
Could I say hi
to the girls?

1786
01:54:54,871 --> 01:54:56,006
Is anyone not busy?

1787
01:54:57,240 --> 01:54:59,743
Have they even noticed
I'm not around?

1788
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:57,167
We're on.

1789
01:55:58,268 --> 01:55:59,870
Two for one.

1790
01:56:00,937 --> 01:56:02,906
Hot dog.

1791
01:56:02,939 --> 01:56:05,075
Let's have a drink.

1792
01:56:05,108 --> 01:56:07,844
One wrinkle.
What is that?

1793
01:56:07,878 --> 01:56:10,347
They won't release
Pryor with Powers, not at the bridge.

1794
01:56:10,380 --> 01:56:12,115
They'll release him
at the same time.

1795
01:56:12,149 --> 01:56:14,251
When the Russians give us
Powers on the bridge,

1796
01:56:14,284 --> 01:56:16,920
they'll release Pryor
over Checkpoint Charlie.

1797
01:56:16,953 --> 01:56:18,455
What does that mean?

1798
01:56:18,488 --> 01:56:21,958
I think it means,
"We wanna have the last word."

1799
01:56:22,993 --> 01:56:23,994
But they will do it.

1800
01:56:25,095 --> 01:56:26,296
You tell me.
You felt them out.

1801
01:56:47,384 --> 01:56:48,985
Where are they?

1802
01:56:49,019 --> 01:56:50,353
Where's our guy?
Where's our guy?

1803
01:56:50,387 --> 01:56:51,988
They're late.

1804
01:56:52,022 --> 01:56:53,957
Nobody's late.
We're early.

1805
01:56:53,990 --> 01:56:55,425
May I?
Yeah.

1806
01:57:02,399 --> 01:57:03,466
Hoffman.

1807
01:57:03,500 --> 01:57:05,035
Yeah?

1808
01:57:05,068 --> 01:57:06,503
I think they have...

1809
01:57:06,536 --> 01:57:08,271
What?

1810
01:57:08,305 --> 01:57:10,173
...snipers.

1811
01:57:10,207 --> 01:57:11,474
Well,
I'm sure they do.

1812
01:57:12,375 --> 01:57:14,077
How are you
sure they do?

1813
01:57:14,544 --> 01:57:16,346
Because we have snipers.

1814
01:57:34,164 --> 01:57:35,298
Step out, sir.

1815
01:57:43,573 --> 01:57:45,008
Jim.

1816
01:57:49,246 --> 01:57:50,246
Dear Jim.

1817
01:57:52,282 --> 01:57:54,184
How are you?

1818
01:57:55,051 --> 01:57:57,220
Happy to see you.

1819
01:57:57,254 --> 01:57:59,189
Have you arranged
all this for me?

1820
01:57:59,222 --> 01:58:02,025
Well, let's see what this is before I...
I take credit for it.

1821
01:58:03,326 --> 01:58:05,262
Any word about Pryor
from Checkpoint Charlie?

1822
01:58:29,619 --> 01:58:31,321
Nothing cooking yet.

1823
01:58:38,061 --> 01:58:39,362
Excuse me, sir.

1824
01:58:39,396 --> 01:58:41,531
This is Lieutenant Joe Murphy,
United States Air Force,

1825
01:58:41,564 --> 01:58:43,300
here to identify Powers.

1826
01:58:44,067 --> 01:58:45,135
Lieutenant Murphy.

1827
01:58:45,568 --> 01:58:47,070
Sir.

1828
01:58:50,240 --> 01:58:52,042
There may be
a slight glitch.

1829
01:58:52,075 --> 01:58:54,210
I was a young man
when I left.

1830
01:58:54,244 --> 01:58:56,279
Who will they find
to identify me?

1831
01:58:57,514 --> 01:59:00,250
Well, I hope it's not your
East German family.

1832
01:59:00,283 --> 01:59:02,118
I doubt they could
identify each other.

1833
01:59:37,287 --> 01:59:38,488
Looks like our party.

1834
01:59:46,329 --> 01:59:48,631
Well, let's go.

1835
01:59:48,665 --> 01:59:50,333
You can stay here,
Donovan.

1836
01:59:51,468 --> 01:59:52,602
Not likely.

1837
01:59:55,171 --> 01:59:56,339
Open the gate.

1838
02:00:11,388 --> 02:00:13,356
What do you think will happen
when you get home?

1839
02:00:14,124 --> 02:00:15,425
Uh, I think...

1840
02:00:16,459 --> 02:00:18,395
I'll have a vodka.

1841
02:00:21,231 --> 02:00:22,298
Yeah.

1842
02:00:23,199 --> 02:00:24,467
Yeah.

1843
02:00:24,501 --> 02:00:27,303
But, Rudolf, is there
not the possibility...

1844
02:00:27,337 --> 02:00:29,406
That my people
are going to shoot me?

1845
02:00:30,607 --> 02:00:31,641
Yes.

1846
02:00:33,443 --> 02:00:35,512
You're not worried?
Would it help?

1847
02:00:47,657 --> 02:00:50,627
To answer your question,
my friend,

1848
02:00:50,660 --> 02:00:53,229
I acted honorably.
I think they know that.

1849
02:00:54,531 --> 02:00:56,399
But sometimes
people think wrong.

1850
02:00:56,433 --> 02:00:57,634
People are people.

1851
02:00:59,369 --> 02:01:00,703
Let's see how they
greet me.

1852
02:01:02,572 --> 02:01:04,207
What can I look for?

1853
02:01:07,177 --> 02:01:10,680
If I'm embraced or just
shown the back seat.

1854
02:01:51,421 --> 02:01:52,555
<i>Da.

1855
02:02:05,368 --> 02:02:06,736
Take off the hat.

1856
02:02:13,309 --> 02:02:14,511
Hey, Powers.

1857
02:02:16,312 --> 02:02:17,580
Hey, Murph.

1858
02:02:19,449 --> 02:02:20,683
Yeah, that's Powers.

1859
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:25,722
All right,
Mr. Donovan. We go now!

1860
02:02:25,755 --> 02:02:27,223
Hang on.

1861
02:02:34,497 --> 02:02:35,798
Believe me,
I will tell you.

1862
02:02:37,867 --> 02:02:39,402
There's no one here.

1863
02:02:42,739 --> 02:02:44,807
They're releasing another man
at Checkpoint Charlie.

1864
02:02:44,841 --> 02:02:46,843
We're just confirming
that he's there.

1865
02:02:46,876 --> 02:02:48,478
Now!

1866
02:02:48,511 --> 02:02:49,812
As per plan,
if you please.

1867
02:02:51,414 --> 02:02:52,849
Let's go.

1868
02:02:52,882 --> 02:02:55,718
Pryor will show up
or he won't. Let's go.

1869
02:02:55,752 --> 02:02:58,621
They're waiting to see
if we'll do it without him.

1870
02:02:58,655 --> 02:03:00,557
We just have to stand here,
show them we won't.

1871
02:03:02,358 --> 02:03:03,493
I don't give a shit
what they want.

1872
02:03:03,526 --> 02:03:05,828
We have our objective.
Go ahead, Abel.

1873
02:03:07,630 --> 02:03:10,500
Go ahead, sir.
You can go.

1874
02:03:10,533 --> 02:03:12,602
If it is not to plan,
we go home.

1875
02:03:12,635 --> 02:03:14,571
We exchange now
or we go home!

1876
02:03:17,373 --> 02:03:19,576
You're waiting for another man?
Yup.

1877
02:03:20,643 --> 02:03:22,245
You want him, too.

1878
02:03:24,314 --> 02:03:25,548
I want him.

1879
02:03:25,582 --> 02:03:26,749
Doesn't matter
what he wants, sir.

1880
02:03:26,783 --> 02:03:28,585
I'm in charge and
you are free to go.

1881
02:03:29,519 --> 02:03:31,287
Please go.
Walk across.

1882
02:03:42,932 --> 02:03:44,334
I can wait.

1883
02:04:09,425 --> 02:04:11,794
It's something.
I'm not sure yet.

1884
02:04:13,863 --> 02:04:14,897
Hang on!

1885
02:04:59,876 --> 02:05:00,876
Let's go.

1886
02:05:07,550 --> 02:05:08,651
We got him!

1887
02:05:09,752 --> 02:05:10,920
Uh, I, uh...

1888
02:05:13,556 --> 02:05:15,391
I sent you a gift, Jim.

1889
02:05:16,492 --> 02:05:17,960
It's a...
It's a painting.

1890
02:05:19,696 --> 02:05:21,731
I hope it has some
meaning to you.

1891
02:05:23,966 --> 02:05:25,935
I'm sorry. I didn't think
to get you a gift.

1892
02:05:29,706 --> 02:05:31,574
This is your gift.

1893
02:05:34,911 --> 02:05:36,446
This is your gift.

1894
02:06:11,848 --> 02:06:12,848
You okay?

1895
02:06:14,684 --> 02:06:15,804
Let's go, let's go,
let's go!

1896
02:07:35,765 --> 02:07:37,733
Mr. Donovan.

1897
02:07:37,767 --> 02:07:39,702
Colonel Abel asked me
to give this to you.

1898
02:07:42,638 --> 02:07:43,773
Pardon me, sir.

1899
02:07:45,608 --> 02:07:47,088
Were you in charge
of this thing, sir?

1900
02:07:48,578 --> 02:07:50,713
Yeah.
Well, I gotta thank you.

1901
02:07:51,614 --> 02:07:52,849
I gotta thank somebody.

1902
02:08:10,066 --> 02:08:12,869
I gave them nothing.
I gave them nothing.

1903
02:08:14,070 --> 02:08:16,005
It doesn't matter.

1904
02:08:16,038 --> 02:08:18,641
It doesn't matter
what people think.

1905
02:08:18,674 --> 02:08:19,742
You know
what you did.

1906
02:09:10,760 --> 02:09:11,928
Welcome home.

1907
02:09:14,163 --> 02:09:15,731
What a trip.

1908
02:09:20,803 --> 02:09:21,971
Mmm.

1909
02:09:25,241 --> 02:09:26,742
Mmm.

1910
02:09:27,176 --> 02:09:28,778
You okay?

1911
02:09:29,211 --> 02:09:30,880
Yeah, I'm fine.

1912
02:09:32,815 --> 02:09:34,817
Did you get the marmalade?
Yes, yes.

1913
02:09:34,850 --> 02:09:36,886
Yep. Yep.

1914
02:09:37,753 --> 02:09:39,021
I did.

1915
02:09:40,723 --> 02:09:41,924
As ordered.

1916
02:09:46,095 --> 02:09:47,096
Jim.

1917
02:09:48,197 --> 02:09:50,266
This is from Arno's.
So?

1918
02:09:50,299 --> 02:09:52,802
On the corner!
Well, honey, I was busy.

1919
02:09:52,835 --> 02:09:54,770
I'm sorry.
We were so busy.
Oh, for Pete's sake.

1920
02:09:54,804 --> 02:09:56,205
How's Roger?
Is he home?
He's home.

1921
02:09:56,238 --> 02:09:58,741
Carol's home, Peggy's home.
Everyone's home.

1922
02:09:58,774 --> 02:10:00,910
Mom!
Come quick! Look!

1923
02:10:02,178 --> 02:10:04,213
- Mom, come here!
- Mom, come here!

1924
02:10:04,246 --> 02:10:06,782
- Come see this! Look! Watch!
- Come on!
