1
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:37,996
Josh!

2
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:47,381
I'm Kurt Loderwith MTV news.
The film is The Blair Witch Project.

3
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:50,008
One of the scariest films
of all time...

4
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:53,011
I was terrified.
Oh, it scared me to death...

5
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,223
It all started with light heart
and the there documentary filmmakers...

6
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:59,351
...armed with a 16mm camera
and a video camcorder...

7
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,937
...head into the Black Hills forests
of Maryland...

8
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,356
...to make a movie
about a legendary witch...

9
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,692
...and they're never heard from again.

10
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,820
There's no doubt about of the box-office
success on The Blair Witch Project.

11
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,948
What's not clear
is whether the legend is true.

12
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,534
So far the fans are not only flocking
to the multiplex...

13
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:18,412
...they are flowing the little town
Burkittsville, Maryland.

14
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:22,249
People have started coming
to Burkittsville...

15
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,919
...as if itwere Charles Manson's
The Spahn Ranch...

16
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:30,674
...or Ed Gein the serial Killer's house,
to visit a haunted place.

17
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,968
"Burkittsville isn't a haunted place. "

18
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,888
"It's a place that a fictional movie
was set in. "

19
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,556
I wasn't able to see the movie...

20
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,474
...when it came out, because I was...

21
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,351
...in the hospital.

22
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,729
But as soon as they let me out...

23
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:47,065
I was at the movie theatre
seventeen times in a row.

24
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:50,360
The web-site sold me.
The web-site, you know...

25
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:53,071
...has all these police photos...

26
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:55,949
...and official police things...

27
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,201
...all this information...

28
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:58,535
...you really believe it.

29
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,871
Our stick men sold so well
on the internet...

30
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,290
...that we started selling them
in the yard.

31
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:04,958
Ant then somebody came by to buy them...

32
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,335
...and they wanted rocks.

33
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,712
So we got rocks
out of my rock garden...

34
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,882
...but I didn't want to get rid of them
so he offered me $10...

35
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,176
...after he started booting it up more.

36
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,304
His wife really wanted them,
so we sold them to him.

37
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,556
We sold some on the internet
but not many.

38
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,517
It costs too much to ship a rock.

39
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,771
Everybody that comes is like this.
I'm so used to being on video.

40
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:28,649
I make sure, if I go to my car,
or to get the paper...

41
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,777
...that I at least have full makeup on,
and a great night-gown.

42
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:34,655
I wish that they'd used
a fictitious town...

43
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:37,032
...and possibly thought ahead...

44
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:40,285
...toward what type
of repercussions could come...

45
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,996
...from using the word documentary...

46
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:46,416
...in their advertising,
and on their web-site.

47
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:49,920
Get out of these woods, and go home!

48
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:54,299
There was no goddamn Blair Witch!

49
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:58,428
You know, there are a lot of
naysayers who come and say nay...

50
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:02,474
...but then there is supporters who
come up to my town, come up to me.

51
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,602
They run up to me, they stop...
Hey, Selena!

52
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:09,523
They come over to me, they hug me,
and say, "Dude, I know it's real. "...

53
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:12,693
...and they squeeze me, and I say,
"I know it's real, too"...

54
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,820
...and we have a bond.

55
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:19,074
I say, "I know, and they go, I know, man,"
and I go, "I know"...

56
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,355
You think you're a wise ass?

57
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,690
I didn't do anything wrong!

58
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,382
Enough!

59
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,379
They found blood in the van.

60
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,009
Could you turn that down?

61
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:10,806
I'm just trying to set the mood
for the mission.

62
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,392
That's sweet,
but I feel like I'm gonna toss.

63
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:16,770
She's been feeling queasy.
No need to explain.

64
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:18,939
Your comfort is my concern.

65
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:22,651
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it
for Stephen Ryan Parker,

66
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:26,029
who has three names,
so he must be from Boston.

67
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:30,158
Apparently he's here researching
a book with his girlfriend.

68
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:33,537
The book's title is...
Blair Witch History Or Hysteria.

69
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,123
Hysteria Or History.

70
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:39,668
Why is it you guys can't get on
the same page about the witch?

71
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,879
We've always been misunderstood.

72
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,840
We embrace nature, not evil.

73
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,675
Thank you, Erica.

74
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:51,138
Not only a hottie, but a real witch!

75
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:52,931
Blessed be.

76
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:56,894
Wiccan... Wicc it good. 

77
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,479
Wait, why are we slowing down?

78
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:03,692
This is where your other tour mate
wants to meet. She's a little weird.

79
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,028
She thinks she's psychic
or some shit.

80
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:09,364
When did you last talk to her?
E- mail, two days ago.

81
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,701
Are you sure she'll be here?
Yeah.

82
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,912
Kim!
Kim?

83
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,288
Yo.

84
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,041
Is that her?

85
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,959
Kim?

86
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:24,087
Yeah.
I'm Jeff.

87
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,256
I figured.

88
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:30,427
What are you doing there?
Trying to find the energy.

89
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,554
Inside the grave?

90
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:36,141
To stand up. I'm exhausted.
I've been on the road two days.

91
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:38,852
Want a hand?
I want amphetamines.

92
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:42,105
Weed is what I've got,
beer I'm gonna get.

93
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,233
Both - now.

94
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,664
That's right, friends.

95
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,916
For two luxurious days and nights,

96
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:05,629
my friends, you will walk the same
path the witch herself once walked,

97
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:10,175
sleep on the same soil where
her victims' blood was spilled.

98
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,513
Possibly losing your own souls
in the process.

99
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:18,267
I want to thank you all
for coming on the inaugural tour

100
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,394
of the Blair Witch-Hunt.

101
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,813
Inaugural?
You've never done this?

102
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,983
Never.
That's not what your web-site said.

103
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,111
"Over 10,000 satisfied customers. "

104
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,238
No, that's my web-store.

105
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,824
Stick men, t-shirts,
official Blair dirt.

106
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,492
Tours?

107
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:38,412
We're all virgins on this bus!

108
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:58,015
Here? You drove by a huge Safeway
two miles back.

109
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:02,644
That was in Burkittsville. I don't
shop there. I don't even piss there.

110
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,733
Hell of a town you got here.

111
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,776
What century are they living in?

112
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,237
The gene pool's
a little shallow here.

113
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:16,074
Dive in,
you'll crack your skull open.

114
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,953
Ok.

115
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:24,041
Where are we going first?
The ruins of Rustin Parr's house.

116
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:28,712
That guy who heard
the voices to kill, right?

117
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:32,591
- Yeah, seven little kids.
- I hear voices all the time.

118
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,848
Do we need all this shit
for a walk in the woods?

119
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:42,726
The Blair Witch-Hunt
provides all amenities

120
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:46,688
while you risk certain death
and dismemberment.

121
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:49,983
Give it up.
What's with all this camera stuff?

122
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,152
To record all occult phenomena

123
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:55,531
that may manifest itself
in the course of the tour.

124
00:10:55,614 --> 00:11:00,160
Damn, you're really running
Bullshit Central, aren't you?

125
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:04,122
If you don't believe in the witch,
why the hell did you bother to come?

126
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,750
I thought the movie was cool.

127
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:08,961
How much further?

128
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:11,713
Couple more miles.
Jesus!

129
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:15,926
So how far along are you?
What do you mean?

130
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,011
The baby. How many weeks?

131
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:21,306
Six.
You don't want to keep it, do you?

132
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,933
No.

133
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:27,104
But Stephen wants the baby.
Yes. How do you know?

134
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,730
I don't know.

135
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:32,150
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.

136
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:40,951
Welcome to the Parr ruins,
ladies and gentlemen.

137
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:44,580
It's supposed to be
where they found Heather's footage.

138
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:47,374
These markings
are incredible.

139
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,877
Ancient witches' alphabet.

140
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,421
Looks like recent graffiti.

141
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:55,924
They're so realistic.
It's a little scary.

142
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,844
Actually, some of these symbols
are positive.

143
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:03,056
Only those who don't understand
witchcraft would be afraid of them.

144
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,600
And remember, fear...

145
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:06,977
is the forerunner of failure.

146
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:09,396
Ok.

147
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:12,774
What's the story with this tree?

148
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,568
What tree?

149
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,361
Look behind you.

150
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:21,909
Where the fuck
did this come from?

151
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:23,785
This was never here before.

152
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,913
Nice try, dude.

153
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,998
What does that mean?

154
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,251
Maybe you should drop the tree bit
from your next tour.

155
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:33,253
No, no, I'm not making this up.

156
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:34,922
I need a beer.
Me, too.

157
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:39,134
Hey, geniuses, explain to me
why a house built in 1826

158
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:40,761
was built around a tree.

159
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:45,015
This would have been sticking
straight through the living room.

160
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,309
Jeff, nobody's scared.

161
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:10,290
Evil intent in the ground,
may a release soon be found.

162
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:13,961
In peace, release the energy
that be from my magic.

163
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:16,713
Are you casting
some kind of evil spell?

164
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:19,925
Widdershins - Reversing the evil.

165
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:22,427
The first law of wicca
is "Harm none".

166
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:25,889
Cos whatever you do
is going to come back threefold.

167
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,432
The karma's a bitch.

168
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:31,770
What are you really doing?
Communing with Elly Kedward.

169
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:35,732
The Blair Witch? I thought you
embraced nature, not evil.

170
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:38,986
You don't understand.
Elly... was a good witch.

171
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:41,947
She was an earth child, like me.

172
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,783
She's gonna be my mentor.

173
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:47,452
You've spoken with her?
Not yet...

174
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:49,621
but I will.

175
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:51,415
That's why I'm here.

176
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:55,919
To shed my mortal coil...

177
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:58,005
and commune with Elly.

178
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:01,216
Have you ever seen
her picture?

179
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,260
I don't think there are any.

180
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:06,138
Stephen and I found one.
Check it out.

181
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:12,311
We think it was drawn
before they banished her from Blair.

182
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:13,520
Banished, my ass.

183
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:16,773
They dragged her into the woods
in the middle of winter,

184
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:18,984
and tied her
to a fucking tree to die.

185
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:23,113
You make her sound helpless. Can't
witches summon powerful energy?

186
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:26,992
We can...
but we still have to eat, shit,

187
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,077
and die like the rest of you.

188
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:31,872
We just look good doing it.

189
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,383
Why do you need all these cameras?

190
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:46,929
I'm personally hoping for
an Elly Kedward sighting.

191
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:49,598
I've got a big beta
for a quality master.

192
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:53,018
I got a night vision, an infrared,
a cute little mini dv,

193
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:54,853
handhelds for everyone...

194
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:57,981
and this baby can even do
frame-a-second time lapse.

195
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:01,276
If anything comes in for a visit,
we're gonna catch it.

196
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,946
May I have permission
to take this leaf?

197
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,490
Thank you.

198
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:11,411
Evil intent in the ground,
may your release soon be found.

199
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:15,374
And peace release the energy
that be from my magic.

200
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:16,583
So mote it be.

201
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:20,003
Evil intent in the ground,
may your release soon be found.

202
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:23,340
And peace release the energy
that be from my magic.

203
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,925
So mote it be.

204
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:29,137
Ok, wait... How many Heather Donahues
does it take

205
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:30,722
to screw in a light bulb?

206
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:32,766
How many?
Just one!

207
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,893
Just one of them!

208
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:38,939
Do you know
what I could never figure out?

209
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:42,359
What's that?
Blair Witch Project, Ok?

210
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:46,822
Two guys and a girl, sleeping
in the same tent night after night,

211
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:48,448
and no sex?

212
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:50,951
It makes no sense.
You're so right.

213
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:53,620
I mean, they were scared
out of their minds,

214
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:57,583
and the greatest stress reliever
right at their fingertips...

215
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,710
and nothing.

216
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:02,171
I'm a little stressed.

217
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,048
Try some more weed.

218
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,051
Ok.

219
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:11,263
The Bermuda Triangle.

220
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:16,643
It's a place in the world
that's been created by hysteria...

221
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:21,648
...by people's own psychology,
by their own ideas of the place.

222
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:24,193
We were already
a persecuted minority.

223
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:27,237
This whole Blair Witch thing
set us back 300 years.

224
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:30,657
We're back in the burning times.
It fucked up our image.

225
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:34,953
Erica, people fear what they don't
understand. You must realise that.

226
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:39,458
No shit. People think that I drink
blood, that I sacrifice children...

227
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:42,753
...that I worship the devil
just because I'm a wiccan.

228
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:46,089
Where I come from, people think
because I dress in black,

229
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:48,675
I'm some kind of sick killer
or something.

230
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:52,346
I don't even believe in the devil.
Ok?

231
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:56,225
That's a Christian concept.
I believe in nature.

232
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:58,227
I hate nature.

233
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,437
Myth, for me... right?

234
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:02,397
...is just myth.

235
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:07,986
It's not history, it's not metaphor
and it's definitely not the truth...

236
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,531
Stephen, stories like this happen...

237
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:12,658
...because they exist
in a place of truth...

238
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:15,702
...because there's historical evidence,
there's fact.

239
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:17,621
That's what you don't understand.

240
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,373
I want to make a film.

241
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:22,876
Wicca... A Way Of Life.

242
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:24,545
Nice.
Yeah.

243
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:26,713
Wait, wait... Check this out.

244
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:32,052
Look at everyone.

245
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:36,932
Everyone is obsessed
with the Blair Witch

246
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,434
for their own reasons, including us.

247
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:42,688
Goth... A Way Of Life.

248
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:44,857
A documentary on you.

249
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,442
All real, all video.

250
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:50,654
Video never lies, Kim.

251
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,531
Film does, though.

252
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:55,075
Everyone wants to see something.

253
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:57,494
I'm telling you,
hysteria and delusions,

254
00:17:57,661 --> 00:17:59,830
they breed in situations like this.

255
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:03,208
Why are you applying rational thought
to mythology?

256
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:08,297
Because if people believe something
enough, isn't it real?

257
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,966
Perception is reality.

258
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:12,885
You're not listening to me.

259
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:16,513
Babe, I know what you're saying,
I just think it's bullshit.

260
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:20,225
I think you're being
a monomaniacal reductionist.

261
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:28,609
What the hell was that?

262
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:32,070
I heard that, too.

263
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:43,540
Burkittsville's funniest home videos!

264
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:46,084
You scared the shit out of me, man!

265
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:48,795
It answered every single one
of your wet dreams.

266
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:50,631
What are you guys doing here?

267
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:53,133
We've got a tour group,
the Blair Witch Walk.

268
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:56,929
What's your excuse?
Tour group, the Blair Witch-Hunt.

269
00:18:57,012 --> 00:19:01,266
You're supposed to look out for stuff
like this. This is so not happening!

270
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,727
We have jurisdiction.
We have permits.

271
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,854
Yeah? From Cravens? Let me see 'em.

272
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:07,898
They're in the car.
Bullshit!

273
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:11,777
Let's put it this way, one of us
is staying - it's us or you,

274
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,403
and it looks like us, bitch!

275
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:15,656
It's gonna come back at you
threefold.

276
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,324
What?
In the wiccan...

277
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:18,450
Shut up!

278
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:21,119
Your balls will fall off
in three days.

279
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:23,872
Yo, guys, guys,
I think I can settle this.

280
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,708
Just give us till dawn,
then we're out of here.

281
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:31,463
We're cold, we're tired...
and we're a little shook up.

282
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:34,633
We saw something
up at Coffin Rock today.

283
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:38,804
Yeah... Yeah, up at Coffin Rock.
It scared the shit out of us.

284
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:42,349
Guys, stop talking about it,
because I'm gonna freak.

285
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:44,351
I just want to go home.

286
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,937
Can we see this thing...

287
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,399
Coffin Rock?
Blair Witch? Go to Coffin Rock.

288
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:00,701
It's your money, Greta.

289
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:03,203
Next time,
take the Blair Witch Walk.

290
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:07,583
Next time, take the Blair Witch-Hunt.
Here's my card. Call. I'm on the web.

291
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:14,923
They were never seen again.

292
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:17,509
Their footage
was found a year later...

293
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:19,970
underexposed, and useless.

294
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:24,516
I don't trust that these assholes
aren't coming back.

295
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,061
They're going to be pissed
that we took the foundation.

296
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:30,606
I don't think it's anything
to worry about.

297
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:34,359
Besides...
We're gonna be up all night, baby!

298
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:37,487
Giddy-up!

299
00:20:38,614 --> 00:20:40,991
We'll just keep our eyes open.

300
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,784
They're not coming back.

301
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:44,912
Why do you think that?

302
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,789
I just do.

303
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,585
I'll be back in a minute.

304
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:54,379
Up all night!

305
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:56,882
How do your parents feel...

306
00:20:57,716 --> 00:20:59,801
about having a witch for a daughter?

307
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:05,390
My father is an Episcopal minister,
in a one-church-town

308
00:21:05,516 --> 00:21:08,477
back in Munnsville, Illinois.

309
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:11,396
Yeah.

310
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,774
That's a bummer.

311
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:16,568
How many beers is that for you?

312
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:20,781
I'm serious!
You're drinking like a fish.

313
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:23,492
I just think you should
take care of yourself.

314
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:28,121
Jesus! We've already gone
through this once today already.

315
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:08,907
What's going on?

316
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:26,383
What the fuck...?

317
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:33,098
This is my work.

318
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:35,559
This is all my research.

319
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:37,603
Our work.

320
00:24:37,686 --> 00:24:39,021
Every word.

321
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:41,106
Where the fuck are my cameras?

322
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:44,943
This is all of our
goddamn work!

323
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:47,613
How the hell are we gonna make
the deadline?

324
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:51,825
We backed it up on computer.
No, Tristen, that was just notes.

325
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:54,369
Half this shit is original documents.

326
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:56,330
Where the hell was everybody?

327
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:58,582
We were all supposed to be awake.

328
00:24:58,665 --> 00:24:59,917
Guys, where's Erica?

329
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:01,960
I'm right here.

330
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:06,173
We must have fallen asleep.

331
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:09,134
Asleep? It's like
we must have blacked out!

332
00:25:09,218 --> 00:25:11,970
The last thing I remember
was that other group.

333
00:25:12,054 --> 00:25:16,683
Yeah... those fucking dickweeds!
Who else could it have been, huh?

334
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:19,895
They came back from Coffin Rock,
and ripped us off!

335
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:23,607
Ripped? These things look like
they were bit off.

336
00:25:23,732 --> 00:25:27,236
I- I-I... What am I gonna do?

337
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:33,242
At least the tapes are still here.

338
00:25:35,786 --> 00:25:38,914
What?
The tapes. They're here.

339
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,833
Where? Do you see them?

340
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:42,626
In my mind, I see them.

341
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:47,172
Oh, Jesus.

342
00:25:47,923 --> 00:25:49,967
You fuck.

343
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:53,512
They're there!

344
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:00,769
Where they found
the Blair Witch tapes?

345
00:26:00,853 --> 00:26:02,437
You've got to be kidding me.

346
00:26:02,521 --> 00:26:05,274
Come on! Why would they be in there?

347
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:08,944
Newsflash, everybody...
That was just a movie.

348
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:11,822
I don't know why, Stephen.

349
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:19,413
They're under the rocks.

350
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:49,401
There's nothing in there.

351
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:50,777
Reach inside.

352
00:26:53,155 --> 00:26:55,699
Well...?
I don't feel so hot.

353
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:59,036
Jeff, is there anything in there?

354
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:04,416
Jesus Christ.

355
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:09,213
How did those get in there?

356
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:11,340
Are they yours?

357
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:15,010
I think we should leave.

358
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:17,054
How did you know?

359
00:27:17,137 --> 00:27:19,515
I don't know.
Are they yours?

360
00:27:19,598 --> 00:27:21,433
Did you put them there? Did you?!

361
00:27:21,517 --> 00:27:24,645
Jeff, are they your tapes?
Yeah, they're my tapes!

362
00:27:24,728 --> 00:27:26,647
Then, why are they still here?

363
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:31,151
Why is the equipment trashed, the
cameras are gone, but not the tapes?

364
00:27:31,235 --> 00:27:35,239
She's right. Wouldn't those guys
want to fuck up your tour footage?

365
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:37,533
Stephen, I want to leave.

366
00:27:37,658 --> 00:27:38,909
How did this happen?

367
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,623
Oh, fuck!

368
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:46,375
Jesus Christ, the baby.

369
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:53,465
We found blood in the van.

370
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:58,637
Tristen had a miscarriage.

371
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,391
You know that, Cravens.

372
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:05,811
"She bled in the van
on the way to the hospital. "

373
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:11,817
This girl's hypothermic.
Get me heating blankets and a lamp.

374
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,611
It's like she's
been sitting in ice water.

375
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:16,488
We were just camping.

376
00:28:16,572 --> 00:28:20,325
"The doctor thinks
it's hypothermia. "

377
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:23,704
Course, the way I see it
you brought her out here,

378
00:28:23,787 --> 00:28:25,831
you took her into those woods.

379
00:28:25,956 --> 00:28:28,500
She's your responsibility.

380
00:28:28,584 --> 00:28:30,586
Are you charging me with something?

381
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:37,134
You have been... a pain in this town's ass
since you were 10.

382
00:28:40,304 --> 00:28:43,182
You need to learn
to stay out of trouble, boy.

383
00:28:43,307 --> 00:28:45,559
It makes you defensive...

384
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:47,853
Anxious.

385
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:51,648
Last thing you need
is to end up back in the loony bin.

386
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:16,173
How is she?

387
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:20,427
She lost the baby.

388
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:26,183
The doctor will keep you here
till your temperature stabilises.

389
00:29:26,308 --> 00:29:29,728
You lost a lot of blood.
More than usual.

390
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:31,647
It's for the best.

391
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,816
Your body is telling you
something was wrong.

392
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:37,653
Something was wrong.

393
00:29:55,546 --> 00:29:57,798
How are you feeling?

394
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:02,594
I'm not staying here.

395
00:30:04,263 --> 00:30:07,641
Five hours of our lives
are unaccounted for.

396
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:10,853
I want to see those tapes.
I want to know what happened.

397
00:30:10,978 --> 00:30:13,939
I've got some editing equipment at my
house.

398
00:30:14,064 --> 00:30:17,109
We should be able to come up
with some answers.

399
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:20,153
We're still in
the Black Hills, aren't we?

400
00:30:20,237 --> 00:30:21,655
Yeah, right up there.

401
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,077
Let's get Tristen inside.
We can take care of the bags later.

402
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:31,206
I thought we were going
to your house.

403
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:33,792
RFD 431... Jericho Mills, home.

404
00:30:33,876 --> 00:30:35,711
What did it used to be?

405
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:37,629
It was a factory after the war.

406
00:30:37,713 --> 00:30:41,341
They were going to destroy it, so I
got them to sell it to me for a buck.

407
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:42,676
Cool.

408
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:45,888
Sorry about the bridge.
It's the only way in or out.

409
00:30:45,971 --> 00:30:49,141
It's pretty safe...
don't lean on the railings.

410
00:30:57,316 --> 00:31:00,194
I am not a gambling man.

411
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:02,446
But...

412
00:31:03,947 --> 00:31:06,950
I would bet my entire...

413
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:09,995
retirement pension...

414
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:13,540
that the blood in the van...

415
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:17,336
is gonna match those tourists.

416
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,882
You've been looking to pin something
on me since I was a kid.

417
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:27,554
Come on, get in, quick. Before they
eat you. Quick, quick. Let's go.

418
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,938
Burkitt County's cheapest alarm.

419
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:38,440
And what's that do? Squirt water?

420
00:31:38,524 --> 00:31:42,569
No, that actually works. Wave.
It's recording you right now.

421
00:31:42,653 --> 00:31:45,197
I got 'em hooked up
through the building.

422
00:31:45,322 --> 00:31:47,658
I'm a little paranoid.
Hah! a little?

423
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:49,660
I heard that.

424
00:31:49,743 --> 00:31:51,537
But with good reason.

425
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,331
I got a lot of valuable stuff here.

426
00:31:55,207 --> 00:31:56,917
Oh, my God!

427
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,462
Yeah! You wouldn't want
somebody to come in here...

428
00:32:00,546 --> 00:32:03,298
...and steal stuff
that you've already stolen.

429
00:32:03,382 --> 00:32:06,969
Where it comes from is not
my business, nor should it be yours.

430
00:32:07,052 --> 00:32:09,847
I just like to pass the savings
on to others.

431
00:32:09,972 --> 00:32:12,641
Really? And how do you do that?
E- bay.

432
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:16,562
Buying, selling, trading, swapping.
I'm a major player.

433
00:32:16,645 --> 00:32:19,398
I thought all your cameras
got trashed.

434
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:21,567
Well, you can never have too many.

435
00:32:22,693 --> 00:32:26,446
Jeff, I think we've had enough
videotaping for one weekend.

436
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,157
Yeah, dude. Tour's over.

437
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,450
Maybe the tour has just begun...

438
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:33,620
...cos you're walking into
the official Blair store.

439
00:32:33,704 --> 00:32:36,415
Come in, everybody.
This is where it begins.

440
00:32:36,498 --> 00:32:39,710
This is the epicentre of
the Blair Witch-Hunt web-site.

441
00:32:39,793 --> 00:32:44,089
I got my sticks... You can touch
these, they're for the stick men.

442
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:46,633
Don't touch those, those are drying.

443
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:49,511
Did you collect these
in the Black hills?

444
00:32:49,595 --> 00:32:50,762
Yeah, every twig.

445
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:53,515
Here is a rock...
Oh, my God, who made that?!

446
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:54,808
Oh, I did, earlier.

447
00:32:54,892 --> 00:32:59,229
We've got Parr ruins foundation dirt,
that's a big item. I sell that.

448
00:32:59,313 --> 00:33:02,149
T- shirts and sweat shirts, and hats.

449
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:05,027
Here you go, Tristen.
That's for you, gratis.

450
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,945
I feel better.

451
00:33:08,739 --> 00:33:11,450
You're as big an asshole
as the rest of them.

452
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:14,578
What are you talking about, Erica?
This stuff is hot.

453
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:17,039
This is what
the wiccan religion needs,

454
00:33:17,122 --> 00:33:19,458
more capitalism based on
fear and lies.

455
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:23,670
Do you really think it's fair
to exploit our culture,

456
00:33:23,754 --> 00:33:26,798
just to sell stick-figure key chains?

457
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:32,179
I think this place is cool, Jeff.
Thanks.

458
00:33:32,262 --> 00:33:34,806
Jeff, we're tired.
I should get her to bed.

459
00:33:34,932 --> 00:33:36,475
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

460
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,810
Let's see...

461
00:33:38,936 --> 00:33:41,980
The stairs by the kitchen
lead to my editing loft.

462
00:33:42,064 --> 00:33:43,941
The bedroom on the right is mine.

463
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:47,569
It's got the biggest bed
and it's own john. You guys take it.

464
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:49,780
Thanks, brother.
Sure.

465
00:33:49,905 --> 00:33:51,532
Sleep well.

466
00:33:51,615 --> 00:33:54,576
The rest of the bedrooms
are down the hallway.

467
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,786
Hey...

468
00:33:55,911 --> 00:34:00,666
I really appreciate the hospitality,
but take me off your mailing list.

469
00:34:00,749 --> 00:34:02,084
Ok.

470
00:34:03,085 --> 00:34:07,548
They should have never let you out.
You're a long way from sane.

471
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:19,309
I saw something
at the hospital.

472
00:34:20,435 --> 00:34:22,104
What?

473
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,234
It was just like the picture
in the Blair Witch black bible.

474
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,404
The same clothes,
that same face, like...

475
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,824
...she'd been drowned.

476
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:35,242
Who?

477
00:34:35,325 --> 00:34:37,161
The little girl.

478
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,289
Eileen Treacle.

479
00:34:40,372 --> 00:34:42,374
Sweetie...

480
00:34:42,457 --> 00:34:45,919
Why don't we talk about this
after you get some sleep?

481
00:34:46,003 --> 00:34:47,713
I want to talk about it now.

482
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:50,299
You need to sleep. You're in shock.

483
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:55,679
This is so... intense.

484
00:34:56,972 --> 00:34:59,933
Chill out, Erica.
We've watched half of one tape.

485
00:35:00,058 --> 00:35:02,978
We've got four angles,
we've got our handhelds,

486
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:05,856
we've got hours of tapes
we haven't seen.

487
00:35:05,939 --> 00:35:09,651
Last night, when we were camping,

488
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,823
I dreamt I hurt the baby.

489
00:35:23,499 --> 00:35:27,419
That's just because we've been
fighting about it so much.

490
00:35:28,295 --> 00:35:33,342
You've been through a lot.
I know how much you wanted a baby.

491
00:35:33,425 --> 00:35:35,677
I'm sorry I didn't want it.

492
00:35:38,764 --> 00:35:40,557
I'm sorry that I lost it.

493
00:35:42,142 --> 00:35:44,478
Guys, something just occurred to me.

494
00:35:45,521 --> 00:35:48,023
- Where's that tree?
- What?

495
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:52,069
That big tree that was right there.
Now there's just this tiny twig.

496
00:35:52,152 --> 00:35:55,614
See, guys, I told you there was
something up with that tree.

497
00:35:55,697 --> 00:35:59,952
Hand me another of those dv cassettes
maybe there's another angle.

498
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:03,080
Whoa, whoa... what is up with that?

499
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:07,835
I don't know. I think it's chafing
from the backpack.

500
00:36:07,918 --> 00:36:09,002
Does it hurt?

501
00:36:09,127 --> 00:36:11,255
Not really. It just kind of itches.

502
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,632
It's nothing. Here.

503
00:36:17,469 --> 00:36:19,346
What was that?
What?

504
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:20,889
Rewind it.

505
00:36:20,973 --> 00:36:22,391
What did you see?

506
00:36:22,474 --> 00:36:25,060
I'm not sure. A flash, or something.

507
00:36:27,896 --> 00:36:28,897
Coffin Rock.

508
00:36:28,981 --> 00:36:31,358
What?
Coffin Rock.

509
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:37,698
How the hell do you see Coffin Rock?
Can you see in other dimensions?

510
00:36:37,823 --> 00:36:40,200
I don't know.
That's what it reminds me of.

511
00:36:40,284 --> 00:36:43,120
Those guys
that were murdered there in 1886...

512
00:36:43,203 --> 00:36:46,290
...after they were gutted,
their heads were arranged...

513
00:36:46,373 --> 00:36:49,168
...in the shape of a pentagram...
Like that.

514
00:36:49,877 --> 00:36:52,754
A great American pastime -
blame it on a witch.

515
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:55,716
Let me see
if I can get that image back.

516
00:36:55,799 --> 00:36:57,176
Stephen!

517
00:36:58,177 --> 00:37:00,262
Is she gonna be Ok?

518
00:37:00,846 --> 00:37:02,222
I don't know.

519
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:03,557
Stephen!

520
00:37:05,434 --> 00:37:06,935
Tristen?

521
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,030
Tristen?

522
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,190
Shut up.

523
00:37:54,483 --> 00:37:57,402
"You brought it back
with you. "

524
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:16,129
What was all that?

525
00:38:16,213 --> 00:38:19,675
That was Jeff's stupid dog alarm.

526
00:38:21,468 --> 00:38:23,428
The crying.

527
00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:28,141
You heard that, too?

528
00:38:29,351 --> 00:38:31,395
In my dreams.

529
00:38:31,478 --> 00:38:34,773
I thought I was having
this horrible nightmare.

530
00:38:35,732 --> 00:38:37,734
About what?

531
00:38:42,322 --> 00:38:44,116
Children...

532
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:48,412
looking up my skirt

533
00:38:48,495 --> 00:38:51,331
as I twirled round and round.

534
00:38:54,376 --> 00:38:56,044
So I hurt them.

535
00:38:57,963 --> 00:39:00,340
Stephen, what the hell
is wrong with me?

536
00:39:00,465 --> 00:39:03,760
Nothing. Nothing. You're just...

537
00:39:06,763 --> 00:39:08,557
Look, there are...

538
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,643
rational explanations behind this.

539
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:14,062
Behind everything that's going on.

540
00:39:14,146 --> 00:39:16,273
I think we need to go home.

541
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:20,819
I'll get someone to drive us...
Not yet!

542
00:39:20,903 --> 00:39:22,738
Why?

543
00:39:25,657 --> 00:39:28,202
Just not yet.

544
00:39:28,285 --> 00:39:30,996
I need to understand what happened.

545
00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:35,459
You can understand it
on the plane ride home.

546
00:39:42,341 --> 00:39:43,926
Here.

547
00:39:45,511 --> 00:39:46,970
Take these.

548
00:39:47,638 --> 00:39:48,847
Take them.

549
00:39:48,972 --> 00:39:50,682
They'll help you sleep.

550
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:52,476
Come on, take them!

551
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:56,146
You're not making a believer
out of me, son.

552
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,273
It was an accident.

553
00:39:59,566 --> 00:40:03,028
I swear to Christ,
it was an accident.

554
00:40:09,326 --> 00:40:12,204
Jesus.
What the hell was that?

555
00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:14,414
I'm not sure.

556
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,960
See that? Whoa, wait. Look.

557
00:40:18,043 --> 00:40:24,258
Time code goes from 1:32am...
to 3:57am... back to 1:32am.

558
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:27,344
In the middle of the footage?
How does that happen?

559
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:30,681
I don't know. But those were
the hours that we fell asleep.

560
00:40:30,764 --> 00:40:33,809
Can you make it bigger,
or slow it down?

561
00:40:33,892 --> 00:40:36,019
Let me try slowing it down.

562
00:40:39,982 --> 00:40:42,860
Ladies and gentlemen,
that is a naked woman.

563
00:40:42,943 --> 00:40:45,737
What is a naked woman doing
swinging around a tree?

564
00:40:45,863 --> 00:40:47,614
Are we sure these are our tapes?

565
00:40:47,698 --> 00:40:50,325
I'm not sure of anything
in the last 24 hours.

566
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:54,788
I'll re-digitise this at a higher
resolution so I can blow it up.

567
00:40:54,872 --> 00:40:56,999
This will take a few minutes.

568
00:40:57,082 --> 00:40:59,418
I need alcohol.

569
00:40:59,543 --> 00:41:00,752
Caffeine.

570
00:41:01,587 --> 00:41:03,130
Caffeine!

571
00:41:04,298 --> 00:41:07,176
Sure. I live to serve.

572
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,230
Ugh... great.

573
00:41:20,355 --> 00:41:25,319
Stale coffee, no beer,
some old take-out chicken...

574
00:41:25,444 --> 00:41:27,779
but plenty of batteries.

575
00:41:28,947 --> 00:41:30,324
Hey...

576
00:41:30,407 --> 00:41:33,452
What's going on?
We're leaving in the morning.

577
00:41:33,577 --> 00:41:34,786
Really?

578
00:41:36,997 --> 00:41:39,541
It's... It's Tristen.

579
00:41:40,751 --> 00:41:42,878
She's in bad shape.

580
00:41:42,961 --> 00:41:45,464
This whole thing has really
fucked her up.

581
00:41:45,547 --> 00:41:49,259
How come you're the one who looks
like he's having a breakdown?

582
00:41:49,384 --> 00:41:51,887
Look! I'm a little tense, all right?

583
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:55,098
Sorry.

584
00:41:57,601 --> 00:41:59,394
No, I am...

585
00:42:00,687 --> 00:42:02,105
sorry.

586
00:42:02,856 --> 00:42:04,650
I just feel like my whole life's

587
00:42:04,775 --> 00:42:07,277
been turned upside down
the past two days.

588
00:42:07,402 --> 00:42:08,654
I know.

589
00:42:09,738 --> 00:42:14,201
It's been really crazy for you,
but it's gonna be Ok.

590
00:42:14,284 --> 00:42:16,036
I promise.

591
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:17,454
That feels good.

592
00:42:17,538 --> 00:42:19,456
You ARE tense.

593
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:24,336
Like that?
Yeah.

594
00:42:26,421 --> 00:42:28,215
Lower?

595
00:42:29,633 --> 00:42:31,635
Yeah, lower.

596
00:42:31,718 --> 00:42:35,430
How does that feel?
Good.

597
00:42:35,556 --> 00:42:37,140
Lower?

598
00:42:39,893 --> 00:42:41,728
How does that feel?

599
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:15,596
Do they hurt?

600
00:43:16,263 --> 00:43:19,016
No. They're just a little warm.

601
00:43:19,141 --> 00:43:20,684
Don't worry.

602
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,562
I have them, too.

603
00:43:38,535 --> 00:43:40,037
Guys...

604
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,122
want to come up here?

605
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,753
You're out of beer,
if that's what you want to know.

606
00:43:47,836 --> 00:43:50,380
Jeff found a better angle
on this naked chick.

607
00:43:50,506 --> 00:43:52,758
What naked chick?
Cool. How?

608
00:43:52,841 --> 00:43:54,426
I blew up the image.

609
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:56,512
It's a bit weird to watch...

610
00:43:56,595 --> 00:44:00,057
Like watching a hold-up
on a bank security camera.

611
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,850
You get the gist.

612
00:44:01,975 --> 00:44:05,229
- Where is this?
- The foundation.

613
00:44:05,312 --> 00:44:09,066
- This was last night?
- Yeah. During the big blackout.

614
00:44:09,149 --> 00:44:11,360
Can you let us
see her face?

615
00:44:11,443 --> 00:44:12,778
Sure can.

616
00:44:18,242 --> 00:44:21,620
If this is a joke... it ain't funny.

617
00:44:22,371 --> 00:44:24,790
No joke. It's serious, Erica.

618
00:44:24,873 --> 00:44:27,125
While I was gone,
you messed with things.

619
00:44:27,251 --> 00:44:28,627
No.

620
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:31,505
It doesn't make any sense.
I know.

621
00:44:31,588 --> 00:44:34,716
We were hoping you could explain.
I don't have a clue.

622
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,177
You have no memory of doing this?
No.

623
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:40,138
If it's some wicca thing,
you can tell us.

624
00:44:40,222 --> 00:44:42,140
Try and help us understand.

625
00:44:42,224 --> 00:44:45,727
We're just trying to put together
what happened last night.

626
00:44:45,811 --> 00:44:49,815
Find out who trashed my equipment.
That wasn't me. I didn't do that.

627
00:44:49,898 --> 00:44:52,359
Erica, that's you there
on the screen.

628
00:44:52,442 --> 00:44:55,195
Leave me the hell alone, all of you!

629
00:45:00,534 --> 00:45:01,910
Believe her?

630
00:45:02,494 --> 00:45:03,996
I don't know.

631
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:10,502
Jeff, give me your keys to the van.

632
00:45:10,586 --> 00:45:14,423
Where you going?
I have to get out. I need a beer.

633
00:45:16,008 --> 00:45:18,093
Hey, see if we need more coffee.

634
00:45:22,389 --> 00:45:24,600
...earth and fire, water and smoke...

635
00:45:24,683 --> 00:45:27,269
I am going to the store.
You want to come...?

636
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:31,815
Erica?

637
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,528
Erica!

638
00:45:40,532 --> 00:45:42,534
We brought something back with us.

639
00:45:42,618 --> 00:45:44,620
What are you talking about?

640
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,123
I can sense it...

641
00:45:48,207 --> 00:45:50,042
...like someone's choking me...

642
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:52,085
...and squeezing the air out of me.

643
00:45:52,169 --> 00:45:57,799
Look, we're just tired, Ok?
We're all really tired. That is it.

644
00:45:57,925 --> 00:46:00,135
I want to show you something.

645
00:46:04,389 --> 00:46:08,268
I have got the same thing.
It's nothing, it's like poison oak.

646
00:46:08,352 --> 00:46:10,145
But, Kim...

647
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:11,647
They're growing.

648
00:46:19,446 --> 00:46:22,199
Ancient pagan alphabet.

649
00:46:22,282 --> 00:46:25,577
They say it means
you've been touched by a witch.

650
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:32,751
That you're next
chosen to die.

651
00:46:32,918 --> 00:46:34,503
There's something here!

652
00:46:34,711 --> 00:46:36,713
There's something here!

653
00:46:47,307 --> 00:46:48,934
Sweet.

654
00:46:49,017 --> 00:46:51,395
Yo, Morticia.

655
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,857
Hey, Elvira, I got something
you can suck the blood out of.

656
00:46:54,982 --> 00:46:57,025
Oh, yeah? Whip it out.

657
00:47:04,825 --> 00:47:06,994
Excuse me, sorry.

658
00:47:07,077 --> 00:47:09,204
I'm finished now.

659
00:47:14,585 --> 00:47:16,295
What the...?!

660
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:17,754
What is your problem?

661
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,549
You're with the witch people.
Lady...

662
00:47:20,632 --> 00:47:22,467
I'm just here to buy groceries.

663
00:47:22,551 --> 00:47:24,219
Witch!

664
00:47:28,056 --> 00:47:29,766
Freak.

665
00:47:37,399 --> 00:47:40,068
Am I gonna have a problem
with you, too?

666
00:47:40,152 --> 00:47:41,945
No problem.

667
00:47:42,029 --> 00:47:44,698
Good. Let's go.

668
00:47:47,868 --> 00:47:49,495
Ok, look...

669
00:47:49,578 --> 00:47:52,915
Either you ring this stuff up...
or I call your manager.

670
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,292
I am the manager.

671
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:58,587
Really?
Yeah.

672
00:48:00,756 --> 00:48:03,008
Well, then, Peggy...

673
00:48:03,926 --> 00:48:08,805
could you tell the bitch at the front
register to do her goddamn job?!

674
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:10,265
Get the hell out of here!

675
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:13,268
Not until I've completed my purchase.

676
00:48:13,393 --> 00:48:16,146
We don't want people like you
around here.

677
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:20,150
You know what? I am gonna make this
so easy on you, Peggy.

678
00:48:23,111 --> 00:48:25,823
I told you to get
the hell out of here.

679
00:48:26,698 --> 00:48:28,492
You touch me again...

680
00:48:28,575 --> 00:48:32,204
and I will rip out
your goddamn throat!

681
00:48:35,374 --> 00:48:37,709
Keep your motherfucking change!

682
00:48:57,354 --> 00:49:01,066
Persephone, do I invoke... by earth
and fire, and water and smoke...

683
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:04,194
Persephone, do I invoke... by earth
and fire, and water and smoke...

684
00:49:04,653 --> 00:49:07,489
Persephone, do I invoke... by earth
and fire, and water and smoke...

685
00:49:07,865 --> 00:49:10,534
Persephone, I invoke... by earth
and fire, and water and smoke...

686
00:49:10,951 --> 00:49:13,579
Persephone, I invoke... by earth
and fire, and water and smoke...

687
00:49:13,704 --> 00:49:16,373
Persephone, I invoke... by earth
and fire, and water and smoke...

688
00:49:16,748 --> 00:49:19,793
Persephone, I invoke... by earth
and fire, and water and smoke...

689
00:49:19,877 --> 00:49:23,005
Persephone, I invoke... by earth
and fire, and water and smoke...

690
00:49:23,088 --> 00:49:24,256
Persephone, I invoke...

691
00:49:46,695 --> 00:49:48,947
Stone the witch!
Stone the bitch!

692
00:49:49,031 --> 00:49:50,616
Fucking rednecks!

693
00:50:45,712 --> 00:50:47,881
Ow!

694
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:05,149
Kim?

695
00:51:05,232 --> 00:51:08,026
Make me a pot of coffee
on your way up.

696
00:51:14,074 --> 00:51:16,285
You're welcome.

697
00:51:24,585 --> 00:51:27,212
Look, I fucked up your front fender.

698
00:51:27,296 --> 00:51:31,175
I had to swerve
to avoid hitting these little kids.

699
00:51:33,218 --> 00:51:37,556
They were dressed funny, like
from another time. Seven of them.

700
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:38,807
Jeff!

701
00:51:39,016 --> 00:51:40,225
I know this is crazy,

702
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:43,395
but I know those are the kids
Rustin Parr killed!

703
00:51:49,818 --> 00:51:51,737
Coffee.

704
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:54,490
Next to your arm.

705
00:52:11,715 --> 00:52:14,635
Morning.
Hey. Did you sleep Ok?

706
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,846
Yeah, I slept Ok. You?
Yeah.

707
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:20,724
You ready to go?
Yeah. Are you guys ready?

708
00:52:20,807 --> 00:52:22,017
Yeah.

709
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,311
I... appreciate your driving us.

710
00:52:25,229 --> 00:52:28,398
Yeah. I'll get the keys from Jeff.

711
00:52:38,492 --> 00:52:40,327
Come on, Tristen, wake up.

712
00:52:42,162 --> 00:52:45,040
Come on, let's go.
Not yet...

713
00:52:45,123 --> 00:52:46,917
Tristen, we're going home.

714
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:48,919
Erica?

715
00:52:51,046 --> 00:52:52,548
Erica!

716
00:52:53,966 --> 00:52:55,342
Erica?

717
00:52:57,719 --> 00:53:00,389
- Erica!
- Not up here.

718
00:53:00,472 --> 00:53:03,058
Not up there? You sure?
She was just here.

719
00:53:03,141 --> 00:53:05,894
Didn't you hear me?
I just said she's not up here.

720
00:53:05,978 --> 00:53:07,938
Why don't you go check out the van...

721
00:53:08,021 --> 00:53:10,524
What the hell happened to the van?

722
00:53:14,153 --> 00:53:18,198
- Jesus Christ.
We are never gonna get out of here...

723
00:53:18,282 --> 00:53:19,908
Kim, what the hell did you do?

724
00:53:20,033 --> 00:53:22,703
You said you just busted up
the front end!

725
00:53:22,786 --> 00:53:24,830
How the hell did you drive it back?

726
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:29,209
I swear it was just the front fender.

727
00:53:29,293 --> 00:53:30,919
What the fuck is going on?!

728
00:53:31,003 --> 00:53:34,631
They dip their hands in your blood
then press them on your body.

729
00:53:34,756 --> 00:53:37,676
What are you talking about?
The children.

730
00:53:40,262 --> 00:53:43,307
Something I dreamt.
Jeff dreamt it, too. Look.

731
00:53:44,683 --> 00:53:45,934
Look!

732
00:53:50,105 --> 00:53:52,232
Oh, Jesus! What the hell is this?

733
00:53:52,316 --> 00:53:55,944
Something from the woods.
We've all got them. Me, her, Erica...

734
00:53:56,069 --> 00:53:58,197
Where is Erica?

735
00:53:59,615 --> 00:54:00,824
Erica?

736
00:54:02,701 --> 00:54:04,036
Erica?

737
00:54:04,828 --> 00:54:06,038
Erica!

738
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:10,083
What the...?

739
00:54:23,388 --> 00:54:25,015
Erica!

740
00:54:26,308 --> 00:54:27,893
Erica!

741
00:54:29,603 --> 00:54:31,021
ERICA!

742
00:54:42,366 --> 00:54:45,911
We would've heard the dog alarm
when she went outside.

743
00:54:45,994 --> 00:54:49,248
It's like she fucking vanished.

744
00:54:50,624 --> 00:54:54,419
Evaporated is more like it.
Yeah, right, Kim.

745
00:54:54,545 --> 00:54:57,756
You were the one who found
her clothes and those candles.

746
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:00,509
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

747
00:55:00,592 --> 00:55:03,804
A prank. Two little bitches
trying to freak us out.

748
00:55:03,887 --> 00:55:05,722
You paranoid fuck!
Come on!

749
00:55:05,848 --> 00:55:07,850
We'd never do something like that!

750
00:55:07,933 --> 00:55:10,936
Where is she, Kim? Where is she?

751
00:55:11,019 --> 00:55:13,397
Why are her clothes and shit
still here?

752
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,648
How would I know?

753
00:55:14,731 --> 00:55:17,734
Can't you see her, Kimmy,
in your mind's eye?

754
00:55:17,818 --> 00:55:19,945
Very funny, asshole!

755
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:24,074
I think something really bad
has happened to her.

756
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:26,076
Maybe she called somebody.

757
00:55:26,201 --> 00:55:29,329
- I'd like to speak to
Minister Geerson, please.

758
00:55:29,413 --> 00:55:32,708
"He's in a meeting.
Could he return your call?"

759
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:35,961
No. It's urgent.
"Could I tell him what it's about?"

760
00:55:36,044 --> 00:55:39,798
Yeah. His daughter, Erica.
We wanna know if he's heard from her.

761
00:55:39,882 --> 00:55:42,593
The minister and Mrs Geerson
have no daughter.

762
00:55:42,718 --> 00:55:46,847
No, I know, like, they disowned her
or something because she's a witch...

763
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:49,224
"They've never had any children. "

764
00:55:59,276 --> 00:56:00,861
So she made up a story.

765
00:56:00,944 --> 00:56:04,323
She gave us a fake name.
It doesn't have to mean anything.

766
00:56:04,406 --> 00:56:05,574
She lied to us.

767
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:09,369
Why are we seeing all this shit?
Why is all this happening?

768
00:56:09,453 --> 00:56:13,207
I don't know. Collective delusion.
Group hysteria.

769
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:17,669
It's what my book is about. You get
a bunch of people scared enough...

770
00:56:17,753 --> 00:56:20,380
Dude, spare us the bullshit. Please.

771
00:56:20,464 --> 00:56:23,050
It's real. Dude !

772
00:56:23,175 --> 00:56:24,468
It happens.

773
00:56:24,551 --> 00:56:28,931
They teach it at junior colleges
I bet that even you could get into.

774
00:56:29,014 --> 00:56:32,184
How did you get into yours?
You have to brush your teeth?

775
00:56:32,267 --> 00:56:33,894
Jeff, the screen.

776
00:56:33,977 --> 00:56:35,646
Roll it back, rewind it.

777
00:56:39,149 --> 00:56:40,859
No, more.

778
00:56:44,154 --> 00:56:45,864
Oh, shit.

779
00:56:45,948 --> 00:56:48,742
I knew they'd come back
and mess with my stuff.

780
00:56:54,248 --> 00:56:56,124
Fuck off. No one's home.

781
00:56:56,208 --> 00:56:57,793
It's Cravens.
"Sheriff?"

782
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:02,214
Funny. I just found out who trashed
my cameras. I was about to call you.

783
00:57:02,297 --> 00:57:03,549
Turn on your TV.

784
00:57:03,632 --> 00:57:06,552
"I don't give a shit.
I want you to see something. "

785
00:57:06,635 --> 00:57:07,928
Me, too. News at 11:00.

786
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:10,931
Shit. Will you just turn that on?
Humour him.

787
00:57:11,765 --> 00:57:13,892
You watching?
Like a hawk.

788
00:57:13,976 --> 00:57:17,813
Listen, I'm trying to tell you
what I found out on Friday night.

789
00:57:17,938 --> 00:57:19,690
"This is a special report. "

790
00:57:19,773 --> 00:57:22,860
"A brutal murder in the Black Hills
discovered today"

791
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:25,112
"the bodies of five hikers found dead"

792
00:57:25,195 --> 00:57:27,698
"atop the landmark
known as Coffin Rock. "

793
00:57:27,781 --> 00:57:29,658
Disembowelled, Jeffrey.

794
00:57:29,741 --> 00:57:32,911
"A re-creation
of the infamous Coffin Rock massacre"

795
00:57:32,995 --> 00:57:35,664
"popularised by the movie
The Blair... "

796
00:57:35,747 --> 00:57:38,876
Bodies were laid out
in the shape of a pentagram.

797
00:57:38,959 --> 00:57:40,502
Sound familiar?

798
00:57:40,586 --> 00:57:44,464
"We've received word that the victims
include two Chinese tourists"

799
00:57:44,631 --> 00:57:47,926
"and one German, as well as
two unidentified white males. "

800
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:51,263
"Recently, the Black Hills
has been overrun with fans"

801
00:57:51,346 --> 00:57:54,641
"wanting to get a glimpse
of where the movie was filmed. "

802
00:57:54,766 --> 00:57:57,561
- "You looking at me?"
- What?

803
00:57:57,644 --> 00:57:59,146
"Over here. "

804
00:57:59,229 --> 00:58:00,564
There.

805
00:58:00,647 --> 00:58:03,692
Yeah?
"I didn't find your cameras. "

806
00:58:03,775 --> 00:58:06,195
"Don't guess that's a surprise,
is it?"

807
00:58:06,278 --> 00:58:09,448
What do you want from me?
I got five corpses here!

808
00:58:09,531 --> 00:58:11,492
I had nothing to do with that.

809
00:58:11,575 --> 00:58:14,953
You might not have been in charge
but you were involved,

810
00:58:15,078 --> 00:58:18,248
so you and your little friends
had best just sit tight.

811
00:58:18,373 --> 00:58:23,253
"And that means... you don't leave
this county till I say it's Ok. "

812
00:58:50,322 --> 00:58:52,407
I don't know you, Stephen.

813
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:56,954
I don't know a thing about you.

814
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:03,502
I don't know how much to believe
about any of you people...

815
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:07,297
But from now on...

816
00:59:08,298 --> 00:59:12,135
know this:
you are not leaving me here alone

817
00:59:12,219 --> 00:59:14,304
to take the fall for this shit.

818
00:59:15,681 --> 00:59:18,058
Nobody is going out of my sight.

819
00:59:30,487 --> 00:59:32,489
We brought something back with us.

820
00:59:33,282 --> 00:59:35,492
For Christ's sake, Kim...

821
00:59:36,785 --> 00:59:39,037
I'll tell you what's going on here.

822
00:59:44,209 --> 00:59:46,628
It's Erica...

823
00:59:46,712 --> 00:59:49,798
or whoever the fuck she is.

824
00:59:53,093 --> 00:59:55,721
Erica has got nothing to do
with this.

825
00:59:55,804 --> 00:59:59,099
She's a witch, man!
She's one big pissed-off witch!

826
00:59:59,224 --> 01:00:02,895
She's casting fucking spells,
making herself appear,

827
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:05,272
making herself fucking disappear.

828
01:00:05,355 --> 01:00:07,107
It's been her since day one!

829
01:00:07,191 --> 01:00:10,319
Smoke it up, cos you're not totally
psycho yet!

830
01:00:10,402 --> 01:00:13,697
Where are you going?
The fuck away from you!

831
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:15,073
You're a dick.

832
01:00:15,157 --> 01:00:16,158
Kim!

833
01:00:16,241 --> 01:00:19,453
Jeff, you've got to have friends,
somebody with a car...

834
01:00:19,578 --> 01:00:23,248
What did I tell you?!
You're not going anywhere!

835
01:00:25,792 --> 01:00:28,295
Wipe that shit off your face.

836
01:00:30,923 --> 01:00:34,760
You think that your makeup
and black clothes give you power...

837
01:00:34,843 --> 01:00:39,681
...but you're just a scared, cowardly
little girl underneath all that.

838
01:00:39,765 --> 01:00:41,642
You don't understand.

839
01:00:41,725 --> 01:00:44,561
Something happened to us
in the woods.

840
01:00:46,897 --> 01:00:48,732
Something evil.

841
01:00:49,024 --> 01:00:51,026
Why are you so mad at me?

842
01:00:55,072 --> 01:00:58,242
Calm down. I'm not that pissed.

843
01:01:00,536 --> 01:01:02,329
Just stop badmouthing Erica.

844
01:01:02,412 --> 01:01:05,249
She's outside.
Where?

845
01:01:05,374 --> 01:01:06,625
Right there.

846
01:01:12,339 --> 01:01:14,341
There's nothing out there.

847
01:01:16,635 --> 01:01:19,304
Tristen, let's get you back to bed.

848
01:01:19,388 --> 01:01:23,016
You just got to look, Stephen.
Let's go to the bedroom.

849
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:25,144
Look again.

850
01:01:32,234 --> 01:01:33,735
She's out there!

851
01:01:38,991 --> 01:01:40,576
Erica.

852
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:43,745
What happened to you?

853
01:01:44,746 --> 01:01:45,914
Don't be afraid.

854
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:48,167
You know who it is.

855
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:51,920
What?
And you know what you have to do.

856
01:01:53,172 --> 01:01:54,298
Erica!

857
01:02:07,561 --> 01:02:09,271
You know who it is.

858
01:02:10,397 --> 01:02:11,440
Erica?

859
01:02:16,236 --> 01:02:20,532
Tristen, help me. Help me!

860
01:02:23,118 --> 01:02:24,536
Tristen!

861
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:26,872
Aw, Tristen...

862
01:02:27,623 --> 01:02:29,416
Stephen! I got you, grab my hand.

863
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,502
Come on, hold on.

864
01:02:36,048 --> 01:02:38,509
They did it, the little Buster Boys.

865
01:02:38,592 --> 01:02:40,761
They did it! They hanged her!

866
01:02:40,844 --> 01:02:42,429
The little Buster Boys!

867
01:02:42,513 --> 01:02:44,139
Tristen! Shh! Shh!

868
01:02:44,264 --> 01:02:46,433
It's only a dream. It's only a dream!

869
01:02:46,517 --> 01:02:50,354
They're Elly Kedward's dreams!
I don't know why I'm having them.

870
01:02:50,437 --> 01:02:52,856
Why do you think
they're Elly Kedward's?

871
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:55,442
Cos I was seeing them
through her eyes...

872
01:02:55,526 --> 01:02:58,779
...tied to the tree
where they banished her to.

873
01:02:58,862 --> 01:03:01,490
And the bad little boys
from Blair village...

874
01:03:01,573 --> 01:03:04,952
...sneaking out to the woods
to see if she was still alive...

875
01:03:05,035 --> 01:03:07,496
...and... and they let their big dogs
bite her...

876
01:03:07,621 --> 01:03:11,834
...and they poked her with sticks and
then when the blood came out of her...

877
01:03:11,917 --> 01:03:16,338
...they put their palms in it
and pressed it on her flesh!

878
01:03:16,421 --> 01:03:19,675
And then, when they found
she was still alive...

879
01:03:19,842 --> 01:03:23,262
...they untied her... and they put
the ropes around her neck...

880
01:03:23,345 --> 01:03:26,223
...and they hanged her
from the big tree!

881
01:03:32,479 --> 01:03:35,065
Stephen, I think I'm going
fucking crazy!

882
01:03:35,149 --> 01:03:38,277
No! No, you are not going crazy.

883
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:40,028
Do you hear me?

884
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,740
You are not going crazy.

885
01:03:49,121 --> 01:03:50,747
It's Ok.

886
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:52,875
It's Ok.

887
01:03:54,251 --> 01:03:56,128
It's all right.

888
01:04:09,725 --> 01:04:13,020
Jeff? Listen, I'm really worried
about Tristen.

889
01:04:13,103 --> 01:04:15,898
Do you know the name
of the doctor she was with?

890
01:04:15,981 --> 01:04:17,107
No, no, I don't.

891
01:04:17,191 --> 01:04:19,651
Then I think you need to call
the hospital.

892
01:04:19,818 --> 01:04:22,946
Ok. I think there's a phone book
in the desk drawer.

893
01:04:43,967 --> 01:04:45,636
What is this?

894
01:04:51,558 --> 01:04:53,435
What the fuck is this?

895
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,479
What?
These!

896
01:04:58,649 --> 01:05:00,692
I don't know. Where did you get 'em?

897
01:05:00,776 --> 01:05:03,195
In your desk!
What, are you spying on us?

898
01:05:03,278 --> 01:05:06,240
What the hell are you talking about?
No, I'm not!

899
01:05:06,323 --> 01:05:08,242
I've no idea where this came from!

900
01:05:08,325 --> 01:05:10,244
Where'd you get this? Answer me!

901
01:05:10,327 --> 01:05:12,830
She found 'em.
Maybe she put 'em in there!

902
01:05:12,913 --> 01:05:15,791
I wanna know where you got these!
I've no idea!

903
01:05:19,127 --> 01:05:22,840
We've been looking into
your background, Stephen.

904
01:05:22,965 --> 01:05:26,510
You've been such a good little boy
all your life.

905
01:05:26,593 --> 01:05:28,929
How did you get mixed up in all this?

906
01:05:37,855 --> 01:05:39,106
What?

907
01:05:39,231 --> 01:05:41,150
"It's Cravens, you little shit!"

908
01:05:41,233 --> 01:05:44,069
Sheriff, I'm a little preoccupied
right now.

909
01:05:44,153 --> 01:05:47,114
"I need to talk to you.
Get your butt down here. "

910
01:05:47,197 --> 01:05:51,326
My van is trashed. And you know mommy
doesn't let me out after dark.

911
01:05:51,451 --> 01:05:55,122
"I'm right at your front door,
you little twerp! Get down here!"

912
01:05:55,247 --> 01:05:57,875
How can he be out there?
The bridge is gone.

913
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:01,587
This is too weird.

914
01:06:01,712 --> 01:06:03,714
Here!

915
01:06:03,797 --> 01:06:05,132
Jeffrey!

916
01:06:05,215 --> 01:06:06,884
It's Cravens!

917
01:06:09,803 --> 01:06:12,681
We got a few things
to talk about, boy!

918
01:06:15,517 --> 01:06:18,562
You were a punk as a kid,
and you're still a punk!

919
01:06:18,645 --> 01:06:20,481
Open up, Jeff!

920
01:06:27,446 --> 01:06:29,531
Open the goddamn door!

921
01:06:33,368 --> 01:06:36,872
If you know what's good for you,
you'll open the damn door!

922
01:06:36,955 --> 01:06:39,583
You open up
this goddamn door right now!

923
01:06:42,794 --> 01:06:46,048
I told you to stay out
of those woods.

924
01:06:46,673 --> 01:06:50,385
They're not gonna just send you back
to the loony bin this time.

925
01:06:55,682 --> 01:06:58,435
Open the goddamn door!

926
01:07:33,971 --> 01:07:35,139
Jeff!

927
01:07:37,432 --> 01:07:39,685
What the fuck, dude?
Put the gun down.

928
01:07:39,810 --> 01:07:40,978
Put the gun down!

929
01:07:47,025 --> 01:07:48,193
Erica.

930
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:50,070
What are you doing?

931
01:07:52,239 --> 01:07:53,574
Erica.

932
01:08:00,956 --> 01:08:02,374
That's gross!

933
01:08:02,457 --> 01:08:05,836
She... she's...! Oh, God!

934
01:08:17,139 --> 01:08:20,476
You were the last one to see her
still alive.

935
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:27,149
The last time I saw her,
she was heading up here to see you.

936
01:08:29,985 --> 01:08:31,528
I didn't kill her, Stephen.

937
01:08:37,951 --> 01:08:40,537
Don't even think it.
Kim was up here with me!

938
01:08:40,621 --> 01:08:43,457
Well, let me clue you in
to something, all right?

939
01:08:43,582 --> 01:08:46,251
She didn't commit fucking suicide!

940
01:08:48,212 --> 01:08:49,796
One of you...
Oh, wait!

941
01:08:49,922 --> 01:08:53,175
What about you?
What gets you off the goddamn hook?

942
01:08:53,258 --> 01:08:57,221
My word!
Which is worth exactly shit to me!

943
01:08:58,514 --> 01:09:01,558
Where was your little girlfriend
this whole time?

944
01:09:01,642 --> 01:09:05,979
Oh, for Christ's sake!
She can barely get out of bed...

945
01:09:09,858 --> 01:09:11,443
It's backwards.

946
01:09:11,527 --> 01:09:13,195
Go back to bed, Tristen.

947
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:15,864
The little girl backwards.

948
01:09:15,989 --> 01:09:17,825
Erica dancing...

949
01:09:18,534 --> 01:09:19,660
backwards.

950
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,370
Everything backwards.

951
01:09:21,453 --> 01:09:23,163
What are you talking about?

952
01:09:25,457 --> 01:09:27,417
Widdershins.

953
01:09:27,543 --> 01:09:29,211
Undo the evil.

954
01:09:29,294 --> 01:09:31,338
What the fuck is a widdershin?

955
01:09:36,176 --> 01:09:38,929
All right,
she's lost her fucking mind.

956
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:41,390
That's it.

957
01:09:41,473 --> 01:09:42,975
Backwards.

958
01:09:43,058 --> 01:09:44,309
Backwards!
What?

959
01:09:44,434 --> 01:09:46,687
We need to run the tapes backwards.

960
01:09:46,854 --> 01:09:48,021
Why?
I don't know.

961
01:09:48,105 --> 01:09:51,066
I think it'll help us find out
what happened to Erica.

962
01:09:51,150 --> 01:09:52,651
This makes no sense!

963
01:09:52,734 --> 01:09:54,945
I know it doesn't. Just please do it!

964
01:10:04,371 --> 01:10:05,664
See? Nothing.

965
01:10:06,915 --> 01:10:09,668
Try the-the-the
keystrokes backwards.

966
01:10:09,751 --> 01:10:11,879
You know, the fucking commands.

967
01:10:17,301 --> 01:10:19,761
You see? You guys happy?
There's nothing!

968
01:10:32,107 --> 01:10:33,609
There's your missing hours.

969
01:10:35,027 --> 01:10:37,488
This must be when
we blacked out.

970
01:13:10,891 --> 01:13:12,392
Tristen...

971
01:13:14,478 --> 01:13:16,188
What is this?

972
01:13:16,271 --> 01:13:18,273
What did you make us do?

973
01:13:20,776 --> 01:13:23,445
You're leading us, aren't you?

974
01:13:27,908 --> 01:13:30,786
Weren't you watching
the fucking screen?

975
01:13:35,290 --> 01:13:37,000
No.

976
01:13:38,502 --> 01:13:40,212
Get back here!
Grab her!

977
01:13:44,341 --> 01:13:46,176
Get your hands off me.

978
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:47,886
What did you do, Tristen?

979
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:49,930
Stephen, please tell them to stop.

980
01:13:50,013 --> 01:13:53,851
Why aren't you marked like this?
Like the rest of us, like Erica?

981
01:13:53,976 --> 01:13:55,352
What did you do to Erica?

982
01:13:55,435 --> 01:13:58,021
Stephen, why are you letting them
do this?

983
01:13:58,105 --> 01:13:59,481
You killed Erica!

984
01:13:59,565 --> 01:14:03,277
You two are crazy!
Shh, shh, shh! Listen.

985
01:14:03,402 --> 01:14:05,529
Just admit it to the camera.

986
01:14:05,612 --> 01:14:08,198
We're not gonna take the fall
for Erica.

987
01:14:08,323 --> 01:14:14,538
Ok? Just admit it. Don't worry,
sweetie. We're not gonna hurt you.

988
01:14:14,663 --> 01:14:16,290
Not like you hurt the baby.

989
01:14:16,373 --> 01:14:19,209
What? I didn't have anything
to do with the baby.

990
01:14:19,293 --> 01:14:21,211
The witch kills children!

991
01:14:21,295 --> 01:14:25,174
I... haven't killed anybody!

992
01:14:25,257 --> 01:14:26,884
Bullshit!

993
01:14:28,177 --> 01:14:31,722
Oh, God, Stephen.
Tristen, just say the words!

994
01:14:31,805 --> 01:14:33,515
Just say the words...

995
01:14:48,822 --> 01:14:51,074
You're all gonna fucking die.

996
01:14:59,082 --> 01:15:01,251
You wanna kill me?
No.

997
01:15:01,335 --> 01:15:04,379
No, I just want to understand.

998
01:15:04,505 --> 01:15:07,758
But you can't understand
because you're so afraid!

999
01:15:07,841 --> 01:15:12,179
Just like the pathetic children
of Blair village, so frightened!

1000
01:15:13,555 --> 01:15:16,642
Aren't you, little girl?
Who are you?

1001
01:15:16,767 --> 01:15:18,811
She's the witch, man!

1002
01:15:21,855 --> 01:15:25,067
Is that what you think...
crazy boy?

1003
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:28,111
Tristen! Tristen, talk to me!

1004
01:15:28,195 --> 01:15:31,448
Stephen...
What is it, baby, what is it?

1005
01:15:32,783 --> 01:15:35,369
- Tristen's gone.
- Get away from him!

1006
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:39,456
That's not... how you do it.

1007
01:15:43,377 --> 01:15:44,837
This is what you want.

1008
01:15:50,509 --> 01:15:53,053
Tristen, whatever you're doing...
don't!

1009
01:15:53,178 --> 01:15:56,223
I'm not doing anything, honey.
It's all up to you!

1010
01:15:56,348 --> 01:15:58,058
Witch bitch.

1011
01:15:58,142 --> 01:15:59,393
Why did you kill Erica?

1012
01:16:03,188 --> 01:16:04,773
I can smell the fear on you.

1013
01:16:04,857 --> 01:16:07,609
Stay away from me.

1014
01:16:07,734 --> 01:16:09,319
You wanna kill me?

1015
01:16:09,403 --> 01:16:12,072
You can't, can you, Kimmy?

1016
01:16:12,156 --> 01:16:14,491
I will rip your fucking head off!

1017
01:16:14,575 --> 01:16:17,077
Then fucking do it!
Stop it!

1018
01:16:17,161 --> 01:16:18,704
Stop it.

1019
01:16:21,206 --> 01:16:24,418
Aw, isn't that
what your book's about, Stephen?

1020
01:16:24,501 --> 01:16:26,962
People just want to see something?

1021
01:16:30,048 --> 01:16:31,967
You have no balls.

1022
01:16:32,134 --> 01:16:35,387
You can't do it, you weak,
little pathetic...

1023
01:16:35,471 --> 01:16:39,600
Oh, you were the last fucking one
with the balls, you little bitch.

1024
01:16:39,683 --> 01:16:40,684
No!

1025
01:17:48,085 --> 01:17:51,380
"I'm standing in front
of an abandoned broom factory... "

1026
01:17:51,505 --> 01:17:55,217
"... in Jericho Mills, a few miles from
the town of Burkittsville... "

1027
01:17:55,384 --> 01:17:59,429
"... where, just hours ago, police
arrested three obsessed movie fans... "

1028
01:17:59,513 --> 01:18:03,016
"... who allegedly committed a series
of ritualistic murders... "

1029
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:05,811
"... after watching last summer's
blockbuster... "

1030
01:18:05,853 --> 01:18:07,479
"... the Blair Witch Project. "

1031
01:18:07,604 --> 01:18:10,691
'This vehicle,
which you see behind me... "

1032
01:18:10,816 --> 01:18:12,901
"... is owned by one of the suspects... "

1033
01:18:12,985 --> 01:18:17,447
"... and there is blood evidence linking
the suspects to these murders. "

1034
01:18:17,531 --> 01:18:21,243
"Sadly, as has happened so many times
before in this country... "

1035
01:18:21,326 --> 01:18:24,621
"... violent art has inspired
real-life violence. "

1036
01:18:24,705 --> 01:18:27,583
"In this case,
it's the Blair Witch Project. "

1037
01:18:27,666 --> 01:18:32,546
I ain't no documentary
film-maker,

1038
01:18:32,629 --> 01:18:35,382
but I had your videotapes

1039
01:18:35,465 --> 01:18:38,469
slapped together
over at Montgomery College.

1040
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:43,265
Sorta tells the whole story.

1041
01:18:45,976 --> 01:18:47,394
Great.

1042
01:18:47,519 --> 01:18:50,397
You could see how fucking insane
Tristen was.

1043
01:18:50,522 --> 01:18:53,525
She practically begged Stephen
to push her.

1044
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:03,702
Gutting those tourists...

1045
01:19:04,369 --> 01:19:06,955
How'd you have the stomach for that?

1046
01:19:13,629 --> 01:19:14,630
Yeah...

1047
01:19:18,509 --> 01:19:21,470
I don't remember doing that.

1048
01:19:27,226 --> 01:19:30,020
Let's talk about... Peggy.

1049
01:19:36,485 --> 01:19:38,153
What?

1050
01:19:41,824 --> 01:19:45,953
"Apparently one woman
was hanged, and the other victim... "

1051
01:19:46,078 --> 01:19:48,997
"... the cause of death has yet
to be determined.

1052
01:19:49,122 --> 01:19:52,501
"Ironically, both women were murdered
by their friends... "

1053
01:19:52,584 --> 01:19:56,338
"... after allegedly participating
in a vicious killing spree... "

1054
01:19:56,463 --> 01:19:57,714
"... in the Black Hills. "

1055
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:00,843
"The police have not
offered a motive... "

1056
01:20:00,926 --> 01:20:05,389
"... but apparently the two slain female
killers were involved in witchcraft. "

1057
01:20:05,472 --> 01:20:09,226
And, um... what about the redhead?

1058
01:20:10,602 --> 01:20:12,729
She was a real pretty girl.

1059
01:20:13,939 --> 01:20:16,150
She wouldn't put out or something?

1060
01:20:16,692 --> 01:20:19,153
No, we just found her in the closet.

1061
01:20:20,696 --> 01:20:22,489
It was Tristen.

1062
01:20:25,284 --> 01:20:27,244
The witch got into her...

1063
01:20:27,369 --> 01:20:29,371
fucked with her mind or something.

1064
01:20:34,209 --> 01:20:38,463
And your girlfriend? Killing her
because she had a miscarriage.

1065
01:20:38,589 --> 01:20:41,258
Whoo-whee! Now, that's harsh.

1066
01:20:41,341 --> 01:20:43,844
She wrapped the rope around her neck.

1067
01:20:45,888 --> 01:20:48,474
She was taunting me...

1068
01:20:48,557 --> 01:20:50,309
begging me to push her.

1069
01:20:52,478 --> 01:20:54,771
You're not making a believer
out of me.

1070
01:20:54,855 --> 01:20:56,565
It was an accident!

1071
01:20:56,648 --> 01:21:00,777
I swear to Christ
it was an accident!

1072
01:21:00,903 --> 01:21:03,697
"Local officials are urging calm... "

1073
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:06,700
"... and trying to keep curiosity
seekers at bay. "

1074
01:21:06,783 --> 01:21:08,911
"And as has happened in the past... "

1075
01:21:09,036 --> 01:21:11,121
"... rumours about a... "

1076
01:21:11,205 --> 01:21:14,208
"... supernatural presence
causing these murders... "

1077
01:21:14,291 --> 01:21:18,003
"... are spreading like wildfire
over the internet. "

1078
01:21:19,379 --> 01:21:21,340
W-wait... wait.

1079
01:21:21,423 --> 01:21:23,050
Wait a... wait a second.

1080
01:21:23,133 --> 01:21:24,301
Jeff...

1081
01:21:24,718 --> 01:21:26,053
Jeff...

1082
01:21:26,136 --> 01:21:27,805
He...

1083
01:21:27,888 --> 01:21:30,057
He videotaped the whole thing.

1084
01:21:33,477 --> 01:21:36,271
Watch the tapes. You'll see.

1085
01:21:38,982 --> 01:21:41,485
Look at the goddamn tapes!

1086
01:21:44,488 --> 01:21:45,572
Yes, sir.

1087
01:21:47,324 --> 01:21:49,535
Too much trouble
to pay for your beer?

1088
01:21:49,618 --> 01:21:51,495
I didn't do that.

1089
01:21:53,789 --> 01:21:55,249
Oh, yeah?

1090
01:21:55,332 --> 01:21:56,333
Then, um...

1091
01:21:56,416 --> 01:21:58,335
who's this?

1092
01:22:12,558 --> 01:22:14,560
I didn't do that.

1093
01:22:18,105 --> 01:22:19,940
I didn't do that.

1094
01:22:28,407 --> 01:22:30,075
That's not how it happened.

1095
01:22:34,913 --> 01:22:36,790
I didn't do that.

1096
01:22:51,763 --> 01:22:53,765
That's not how it happened.

1097
01:22:55,392 --> 01:22:57,186
Stop it.

1098
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:03,108
"Just... just do it!
Just admit it to the camera. "

1099
01:23:04,109 --> 01:23:06,487
"We're not gonna take the fall
for Erica. "

1100
01:23:06,570 --> 01:23:08,947
"Don't worry,
we're not gonna hurt you. "

1101
01:23:09,031 --> 01:23:10,616
"Not like you hurt the baby. "

1102
01:23:10,699 --> 01:23:13,660
"What? I didn't have anything
to do with the baby. "

1103
01:23:13,785 --> 01:23:15,662
"The witch kills children!"

1104
01:23:15,787 --> 01:23:19,208
"I... haven't killed anybody!"

1105
01:23:19,333 --> 01:23:20,918
"Bullshit!"
"No!"

1106
01:23:21,001 --> 01:23:24,505
"Tell us the truth.
Tell us the truth. "

1107
01:23:24,588 --> 01:23:27,049
"Confess. "
"God!"

1108
01:23:28,842 --> 01:23:31,929
"Stephen, this is me.
What are you talking about?"

1109
01:23:32,012 --> 01:23:33,806
"Stop it!"

1110
01:23:33,972 --> 01:23:36,975
"Tristen!"
"No! No!"

1111
01:23:37,059 --> 01:23:38,602
"Stop! Oh... "

1112
01:23:38,769 --> 01:23:40,562
"She's the witch, man!"

1113
01:23:40,646 --> 01:23:43,524
"Jeff, what are you saying?
I'm not the witch. "

1114
01:23:43,607 --> 01:23:45,859
"Yeah, you are. "
"What are you saying?"

1115
01:23:45,984 --> 01:23:48,362
You know what I'm saying,
goddamn it!

1116
01:23:48,445 --> 01:23:50,197
"Stephen, please. "

1117
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:54,409
"Did you kill Erica?
Confess, confess. "

1118
01:23:54,493 --> 01:23:56,495
"Stop it. "
"Say the words. "

1119
01:23:56,578 --> 01:23:59,456
"Oh, God, Stephen, don't! Please!"

1120
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:01,458
"No!"

1121
01:24:03,961 --> 01:24:05,254
"Fucking witch!"

1122
01:24:06,547 --> 01:24:08,382
This is wrong.

1123
01:24:17,558 --> 01:24:19,351
This is wrong.

1124
01:24:19,434 --> 01:24:21,854
Somebody fucked with this tape!

1125
01:24:22,813 --> 01:24:24,898
Somebody fucked with that tape!

1126
01:24:25,732 --> 01:24:27,568
That tape is wrong!

1127
01:24:27,693 --> 01:24:29,820
That's fucking bullshit!

1128
01:24:32,990 --> 01:24:35,450
That's fucking shit!
