1
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,560
SUNDAY
7:02 PM

2
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,120
57 HOURS INTO THE ROBBERY

3
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,400
The pharmacy has been robbed.

4
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,120
"They took the record books.
I have no idea how it’s happened.

5
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,240
Only you and I knew about it!"

6
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,000
"Do you know that moment
you tie loose ends

7
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,440
that you didn’t want to tie?

8
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,760
It’s painful, isn’t it?

9
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,080
You’re there with your long time partner
and you think:

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,280
'What a fucking bastard'."

11
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,400
I’m on my way there.

12
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,280
"Or: 'What a bitch'.

13
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,800
You refuse to believe it,
but you know there’s a betrayer.

14
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,160
And it can only be you or your partner.

15
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,600
And Ángel knew it wasn’t him.

16
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,080
Raquel was trying to find
an explanation to that,

17
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,760
but when explanations don’t come alone,

18
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,040
there’s always someone
willing to push you a bit."

19
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,800
I’m old-fashioned and still believe
in the good and bad guys.

20
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,960
And I am completely sure
that you are of the good ones.

21
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,520
Could you stand up for the detective?

22
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,800
Because I wouldn’t.

23
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,960
"Ángel thought nothing worse could happen,

24
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,680
but it could.

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,360
Sure it could.

26
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,720
When you hit rock bottom,

27
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,720
there’s still something
before the edge of the abyss."

28
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,920
Soil!

29
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,040
What's the matter?

30
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,440
What’s the matter, Moscow?

31
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,720
We have it!

32
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,160
We have it, mate!

33
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,920
"It wasn’t dark yet that Sunday evening,
when we were in a very euphoric mood.

34
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,400
We had found soil

35
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,080
and Nairobi had the printing presses
working at full capacity.

36
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,800
There was over 400 million euros.

37
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,080
We had sealed the entries
with explosives.

38
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,360
And had the feeling
of being inside a bunker.

39
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,840
It was our ten minutes of glory."

40
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,800
Who wants the sound of the sea?
This is like poetry for our ears.

41
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,000
This is the heart of the world
beating right here.

42
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,120
400 MILLION EUROS

43
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,560
Because we’re making it beat.

44
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,040
Because the world moves because of this.

45
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,000
What’s all this celebrating
you’re doing here? What’s the matter?

46
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,040
What’s wrong with you?

47
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,360
Hoorah!

48
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,200
"Undoubtedly, that was the happiest
moment for us inside there.

49
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,640
Then, we relaxed."

50
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,920
Don’t move.

51
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,960
Do you want to comb your hair?

52
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,120
Thank you.

53
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,960
Do you know how we say back home
"two men make love"?

54
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,480
We say "comb inside".

55
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,720
Sorry.

56
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,000
With all the medication
I have an upset stomach.

57
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,320
-Could I use the toilet?
-Sure, mate.

58
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,240
Thank you.

59
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,280
Jacinto.

60
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,640
Jacinto, it’s Arturo, can you hear me?

61
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,280
Jacinto.

62
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,360
Mr Arturo.

63
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You’re alive.

64
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,920
I was convinced you had been shot.

65
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,280
I didn’t sleep a wink.

66
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,880
We are in the basement with the boilers,
chained like dogs.

67
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,040
We’re locked up
with the four police officers.

68
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,480
We only come up here to use the toilet.

69
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,760
Listen up, Jacinto.

70
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,120
I’ve got a pair of scissors
and I can get hold of more tools.

71
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,480
Screwdrivers, a hand saw, I don’t know.
I can give them to you in two hours.

72
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,240
-Have you got a watch on you?
-Yes.

73
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,600
Make up any excuse.

74
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,080
Try to make them bring you here again,
in two hours,

75
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,080
from now on.
Remember, the second on the left.

76
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,680
I’ll leave them there.

77
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,920
What will we do
with a pair of scissors and a hand saw?

78
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,880
Those people have explosives,
M-16, and all sorts of things.

79
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,240
67 people’s lives are in your hands.

80
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,480
Believe me, it will work out fine, and
in a few hours no more nightmare for us.

81
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,200
All right.

82
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,240
Move, move.

83
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,800
Yes, yes, coming.

84
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,760
The pictures sent by the kidnappers

85
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,280
show explosives
connected to photoelectric cells.

86
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,000
They have been placed in all the entries,

87
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,400
even in the underground ventilation ducts.

88
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,920
-What kind of explosive are they using?
-The bomb squad think it’s C-4.

89
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,440
But I can see they’re more orange,

90
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,960
so we sent them out to the scientific
support branch to be verified.

91
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,680
-Who in the scientific branch?
-We sent them out to Alberto.

92
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,600
There’s no other inspector
in the scientific brunch

93
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,760
who does the same job as my ex-husband?

94
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,120
It was sent out to Alberto
because he’s the best.

95
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,200
It’s a direct order
from superintendent Sánchez.

96
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,120
I see.

97
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,240
-What do the scientific branch say it is?
-They think it’s P-4.

98
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,280
Very similar to C-4, British origin,
and that the connexion is perfect.

99
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,680
They’re making it difficult for us,
aren’t they?

100
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,440
"Alison!"

101
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,760
I think it’s time I had
a friendly chat with Alison Parker.

102
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,360
REPEATER ACTIVATED

103
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,240
Colonel.

104
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,520
There’s an incoming cell phone call
from inside the building.

105
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,920
Record it.

106
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,160
It’s from Jun Li, a hostage.

107
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,560
"It’s Aníbal Cortés.

108
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,600
What do you want?"

109
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,520
To help you, Aníbal.

110
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,840
In order to do so, we need
you to help us get inside the Fábrica

111
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,080
and get the hostages out
in the least aggressive way possible.

112
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,160
There’s plastic explosive
in all the entries.

113
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,120
Yes, coming in is no problem, but...

114
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,600
we need an ally.

115
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,400
"An ally who can tell us
where the robbers are at every minute."

116
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,760
I see, and why would I sell
my partners out to you?

117
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,280
They will tempt you with a better future,

118
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,840
a prison sentence reduction,
that in one or two years you’ll be out.

119
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,960
If you help us,
you’ll be eligible for parole,

120
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,640
a reduction in you prison sentence
to two years.

121
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,960
"You’ll have a new future ahead of you
by the age of 22. Think it over."

122
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,920
Divide and conquer, that’s the motto.

123
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,880
It worked for a small town in Italy
to take control of the whole world.

124
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,160
It worked for Napoleon later,

125
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,040
and now it’s working for the Police.

126
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,480
They’ll use the slightest contact

127
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,480
to tempt any of you.

128
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,920
After 48 hours inside
the pressure will start sinking in,

129
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,720
anguish, negativism.

130
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,400
And it will be then, when they’ll try
to aim for the weakest link.

131
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,200
"There isn’t weakness in us.

132
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,200
There is in those outside."

133
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,600
"It’s not too late, honey."

134
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,520
By the time they attempt to contact,

135
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,960
you’ll have committed six
or eight crimes, at least.

136
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,600
No judge can guarantee you
walking free, none.

137
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,120
Once inside, the only one
who can guarantee you being free

138
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,960
it’s me.

139
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,000
Aníbal, listen to me carefully.

140
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,160
"The judge guarantees you being free
in a very short time."

141
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,840
Okay, let’s square up
the numbers, inspector.

142
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,000
Let’s see, aggravated robbery:

143
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,080
from two to five years.

144
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,400
"Hostage taking and setting conditions

145
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,960
for the release of four escort
police officers: 40 years."

146
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,200
Hacking the alarm system, computer crime,

147
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,880
we’re talking about
six months up to two years.

148
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,160
Public order offence
for breaking in the Fábrica:

149
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,640
one to six years.

150
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,080
And with the hostages
It’s much more difficult.

151
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,720
67 hostages.

152
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,520
The law says that it can be from six up
to ten years for each kidnapping.

153
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,560
Then, it’s the point-blank shooting
at the police on the first day:

154
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,560
from six to eight years for each officer.

155
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,720
But they were wounded too,
which is an offence causing injury

156
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,920
"an aggravating circumstance

157
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,040
that adds eight years
for each injured police officer."

158
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,320
We are talking about,
if we have a tough judge,

159
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,520
723 years

160
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,080
the prosecution will ask for.
The shortest sentence you can be offered

161
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,400
by the judge and the prosecution, without
using the penal code as toilet paper...

162
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,960
"It’s 173 years.

163
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,680
Don’t let them fool you."

164
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,120
The penal code is the rules
of the game of any country.

165
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,840
No one can break them, no one.

166
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,400
There’s one thing
we can actually agree with.

167
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,560
The presidential pardon.

168
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Tell him yes.

169
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,480
You want me to ask the president
for a presidential pardon?

170
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,480
No, I want you to ask the president
to be on TV

171
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,800
and in front of the whole Spain,
say that if any of the kidnappers

172
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,720
decide to cooperate to end this crisis,
the possibility of offering them

173
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,160
"a pardon in exchange
for their cooperation will be studied.

174
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,200
First, the president
will be in the news report."

175
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,960
-He’s bluffing.
-"After that, I’ll consider the option

176
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,880
-of being a fucking rat."
-Very good, we’ll do it.

177
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,680
But for that to happen we need
a gesture of goodwill from you.

178
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,880
Tell us the name of the Professor

179
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,640
and how many robbers there are inside.

180
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,160
I think we have to go along with him.

181
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,520
"Come on, Aníbal,
give me a name and a number,

182
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,440
and I can assure you
you will have a future again."

183
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,560
Okay.

184
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,520
A name and a number.

185
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,360
"Get a piece of paper and a pen”.

186
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,160
My bollocks 33!

187
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,160
What a son of a bitch.

188
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,360
Fuck.

189
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,120
Attention, we cut off all communication
with the Fábrica.

190
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,600
What the hell did you do?

191
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,760
You screwed up any chance
of buying us some more time.

192
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,160
They didn’t buy it, okay?

193
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,520
I could hear the bloody murmuring,
for fuck’s sake.

194
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,240
Let’s see, who do you think you are?

195
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,800
You had to execute, not decide.

196
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,360
Or change the plans, fuck.

197
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,360
And that murmuring thing,
what the heck is it?

198
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,360
He heard the conversation and if he says
she wasn’t buying it, it means she wasn’t.

199
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,360
We have been messing around
with the bloody inspector for some days.

200
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,080
So it’s not his fault, okay? Are we clear?

201
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,160
That’s right.

202
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,360
She wasn’t going to phone the president,
or the TV, or her fucking mother.

203
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,400
You and your things. You, assholes.

204
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,000
"Despite his great performance,

205
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,640
Río knew, the whole time,
he wanted to accept the deal,

206
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,600
freeze time and get out of there
as if nothing had happened."

207
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,880
Would you have liked
to accept the deal with the police?

208
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,400
You know that all this won’t end well,
don’t you?

209
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,840
Do you know what life imprisonment
without a possibility of parole is?

210
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,680
That’s what I’ll get.

211
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,000
I killed a security guy

212
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,760
and some months later I broke into here,

213
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,760
and I shot a police officer.

214
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,320
And you look so demure.

215
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,880
Do you think a judge will believe
in my reintegration?

216
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,160
No.

217
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,640
I trust the Professor.

218
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,200
I fully support him.

219
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,320
You didn’t answer me.

220
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,400
Would you have liked to accept?

221
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,880
Well, really...

222
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,000
what would happen if we got out of here?

223
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,120
Would we stay together?

224
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,040
Would you be trying to give me
my badge back all the time?

225
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,520
You're talking
about betraying your friends.

226
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,680
My friends?
My friends who have names of cities?

227
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,600
Tokyo, Berlin, Moscow, Denver...

228
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,360
My friends with cities' names
are ass-kicking.

229
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,480
And I’m going to tell you something.

230
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,000
You’d better hide away
if you accept the deal,

231
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,840
because if I see you,
I’ll shoot you in your temple.

232
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,280
I’ve just spoken to the security guard.

233
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,440
I saw him in the toilet.
He says that they are penned up,

234
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,080
11 security guards and 4 police officers.
They are our last chance.

235
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,480
I’m not hungry, thank you.

236
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,160
-Are you sure?
-Yes, thanks.

237
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,320
Our last chance,
how, if they are penned up?

238
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,080
We have to give them arms at all costs.

239
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,000
And also, obtain tools
and pass them on to them.

240
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,560
Which tools do you want to steal?

241
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,960
Drill bits, hammers, screws, anything.

242
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,360
You saw what I saw,
they’ve got and arsenal down there.

243
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,920
We have to take them
and leave them in the toilet.

244
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,160
Look, Pablo, I can’t do this on my own.

245
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,920
All right? I need your help.

246
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,040
When this Slavic gorilla
escorts me for a walk,

247
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,240
-I need you to distract him.
-Me?

248
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,080
Yes, he has treated my wound,
he doesn’t take his eyes off me,

249
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,200
he helps me to walk.

250
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,120
Then you distract him.

251
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,120
And I’ll steal the tools
and whatever is needed.

252
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,400
It’s over.

253
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,040
Arturo, relax.

254
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,880
Take care of your wound.

255
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,400
I’ll come later.

256
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,320
Come on, those in the tunnel, here.

257
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,960
-Those at the printing press, there.
-Don’t talk about the plan to anyone.

258
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,240
It’s only for us. The fewer we are,

259
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,960
the more chances we have to succeed.
We’ll help the others from outside.

260
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,440
Arturo, I’ll be back in a minute.

261
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,600
Come in.

262
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,720
And sit down.

263
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,320
Mercedes.

264
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,120
Hello.

265
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,680
I called you in to see
what can be done about your pupil.

266
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,160
She ran away and we found her
hiding inside the safety box.

267
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,080
Why do you think she’s so rebellious?

268
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,600
It might be, perhaps,
rebelliousness of virgins?

269
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,240
-What are you talking about, virgins?
-Nairobi.

270
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,720
We can see it in many species.

271
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,200
Virgins are rebellious,
because they haven’t been broken in.

272
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,840
I say this with all my respect.

273
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,600
It’s like what happens to mares,
not until they are broken in,

274
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,760
not until you ride them,

275
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,240
they can run off, kick someone,
they are completely unpredictable.

276
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,440
You must have heard
of that concept, haven’t you, miss?

277
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,960
How old were you when you lost
your virginity, Mercedes?

278
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,280
Mercedes.

279
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,920
There’s no problem, you can say it,
please, we’re here,

280
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,800
among friends.

281
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,840
Miss.

282
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,400
Well, eh...

283
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,520
I, you see, come from
a very small town in Soria.

284
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,600
When I was 24.

285
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,800
Good.

286
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,080
And weren’t you aware, before that,
of that virginal rebelliousness?

287
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,920
I don’t really know.

288
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,640
-Think about it.
-Maybe.

289
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,240
As a matter of fact, before losing it,

290
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,560
I ran away from home and went
to the Medinaceli festival, three times.

291
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,680
-I don’t know if that’s...
-That’s it.

292
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,920
Exactly that.

293
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,360
Here you are.

294
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,240
Intense "Volluto" with sugar.

295
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,560
Thank you.

296
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,480
Medinaceli festival.

297
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,560
And you, Alison?

298
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,000
Are you a virgin?

299
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,280
Yes.

300
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,880
So what?

301
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,400
I’m not scared of you
with those nutty speeches.

302
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,760
You won’t do anything to me, you know why?

303
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,720
Because I’m not just a hostage.
I’m a safe-conduct.

304
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,800
This is it.

305
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,840
The rebelliousness of the virgins,

306
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,240
here it is, no doubt.

307
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,320
Ariadna, darling, please, can you pass me
that small red folder?

308
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,280
-Coming.
-Sure.

309
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,120
Let’s see what we have here.

310
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Your aunt Becky,
volunteer in a small village in Mali.

311
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,320
Here we have your cousin Elsie,

312
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,920
looking very beautiful in Kings College.

313
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,400
Brian, it’s the brainy one in the family,
in Wellington.

314
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,640
And here we have several photos,

315
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,680
whose? Your sister Lis, just next to you,

316
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,880
in La Moraleja,
she goes to the same school as you.

317
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,840
However, I think she doesn't have
your same temper.

318
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,920
A girl from your social status
I’m sure has no idea

319
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,480
how much a hit man costs to hire, do you?

320
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,520
We can find a decent one
for 30,000 euros.

321
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,920
However, to shoot your aunt in Africa

322
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,200
10,000 euros can arrange it, 10,000 euros.

323
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,600
Your family’s lives are in your hands.

324
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,920
Nairobi.

325
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,240
Move.

326
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,120
Move.

327
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,000
When I told you to make yourself heard,
I should have said

328
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,080
what’s most important
is to choose the right moment.

329
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,640
Call to monitor, Berlin.

330
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,240
-Everything well here, and in there?
-"Everything in order."

331
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,880
Brilliant, then the next phone call
in six hours.

332
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,760
Inspector,

333
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,800
the underground unit have found
oscillations on the seismograph.

334
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,960
They are working with heavy machinery.
Indeed, they’re building a tunnel.

335
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,840
We need to bring in a GPR, now.

336
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,680
See if we can find out
where they are building the bloody tunnel.

337
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,600
I’m on it.

338
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,360
Let’s see, listen all up.

339
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,000
Those who are not essential here
may leave.

340
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,840
Essential means
those who are doing something now.

341
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,760
The rest of you can go and have a rest.

342
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,720
And have a shower, please.

343
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,480
This is beginning to smell of deep police.

344
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,160
I rectify.

345
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,040
Please, can you all go out for a moment?

346
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,160
I have to relieve you from the case,
I’m sorry.

347
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,200
I think all this will be clarified,
but, right now, I can’t trust you.

348
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,720
You cannot trust me.

349
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,440
The thing is that you and I
knew about Toledo, Raquel.

350
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,920
You and I.

351
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,320
What the heck are you talking about?

352
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,000
I am not the betrayer.

353
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,840
So it’s only down to you.

354
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,560
What a nerve!

355
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,640
They knew we were entering the museum
wearing the masks

356
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,360
at the same time you knew it,

357
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,160
and they knew
we were going to the wreck yard,

358
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,720
and they knew about the fucking pharmacy.

359
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,400
Yes, it can’t be anything else, huh?

360
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,640
-What thing?
-Who knows? A phone call,

361
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,320
a telephone, a fucking microphone.

362
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,560
-Only you and I knew about the pharmacy.
-And you didn’t tell anyone, have you? No?

363
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,760
"Not even that weird guy from the café.
Did you say anything to him?

364
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,760
-What?
-To him, your shoulder to cry on.

365
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,800
A guy shows up here yesterday,
and you tell him about your whole life.

366
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,960
As if you were new in this."

367
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,720
And you don’t suspect him.

368
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,560
He’s been inside here, Raquel,
he’s been inside the tent.

369
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,000
Have you checked him out?

370
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,480
Because I have.
Have you done your bloody job?

371
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,880
He has a workshop, that fellow, nearby.
He says he makes cider.

372
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,880
And everything is covered by thin canvas,
who knows what he’ll be covering.

373
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,840
-Don’t tell me you have followed him.
-Yes, I’ve been following him.

374
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,960
He doesn’t do any cider or any bullocks.

375
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,880
He makes rubbish cider from a carton
and pours it into a cauldron.

376
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,400
And there’s rubbish all over,
fucking hell.

377
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,440
He has a car which is just scrap,
and sleeps in a bunk bed

378
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,440
surrounded by wheels and oil stains.

379
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,920
It smells like a chemist cooking meth
and I don’t know what the heck he cooks.

380
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,120
He is dodgy, Raquel, he is.

381
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,800
And you suspect me, I’m the only suspect.

382
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,400
Me, me, me!

383
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,960
How much will they pay you, one million?
Two?

384
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,680
Look here, Raquel.

385
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,520
Listen carefully.

386
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,120
Bugger off.

387
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,400
Suárez!

388
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,440
-Suárez!
-I can’t believe it.

389
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,880
Handcuff him and take him away.

390
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,840
Calm down, inspector.
That’s not the protocol.

391
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,320
-Yes, yes it is, Suárez, handcuff me.
-Bugger off the protocol.

392
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,200
-Handcuff me.
-Handcuff him and take him away.

393
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,280
If you want, I can call Internal Affairs,

394
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,120
but, for the time being,
no one is going to handcuff no one.

395
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,360
Raquel.

396
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,480
I’ve been 15 years with you.

397
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,280
With me? No.

398
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,600
You’ve been getting close to me
to see if I fall for you.

399
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,400
Always fucking Cercedilla in your mouth.

400
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,440
Always "I’m leaving Mari Carmen."

401
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,600
And your fucking womanizer’s jokes.
And now, that at last, I say no to you

402
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,920
it happens that Mr Pervert Pimpin here
has turned into a betrayer,

403
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,280
a betrayer.

404
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,760
What did you sell, Ángel?

405
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,680
Our friendship?

406
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,800
This operation?

407
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,160
Look here,

408
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,440
leave right now.

409
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,880
"Do you know
what ‘collateral damage’ means?

410
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,560
It’s a term coined during the war
in Vietnam by the American army,

411
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,720
when they didn’t have the guts
to talk clearly about killing civilians.

412
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,480
But it’s sometimes used
to take the blame off you,

413
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,200
like a boomerang.

414
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,040
And that was what was
about to happen to the Professor."

415
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,760
Hurry up.

416
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,280
Faster, faster, hurry.

417
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,800
Hurry, faster.

418
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,960
Take a couple of bags

419
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,520
and clean this crap.

420
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,000
Dinner is next.

421
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,520
I managed to steal a few things
from the tool box.

422
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,440
What things?

423
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,080
Some saw blades,

424
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,800
some screwdrivers, files.

425
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,000
Look.

426
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,480
What are you doing? Hide it away.

427
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,600
In 35 minutes,

428
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,880
ask to be escorted to the toilet.

429
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,280
Go in the second loo on the left.

430
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,480
Take the tools and you duct tape them
under the lid of the loo, inside.

431
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,680
They will get there in about 40 minutes,
All right?

432
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,440
It can’t be. Me? Me again?

433
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,480
I have stolen all the tools.
I’m loaded with scrap, fuck.

434
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,160
And you want to hand it to me here?

435
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,520
Do your part and I’ll do mine, mate.

436
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,560
"Raquel?

437
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,840
Is there anything the matter?
Are you all right?"

438
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,640
Well, I’m here alone and bored
in the café and...

439
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,600
and a little disappointed,
if I’m honest with you.

440
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,320
Excuse me, I don’t quite understand,
disappointed?

441
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,360
I was meeting up with someone for dinner.

442
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,440
My first dinner out in eight years

443
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,840
"with someone who wasn’t
my family, I mean.

444
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,880
But I think he stood me up."

445
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,960
And won’t it be
that you were 36 minutes early?

446
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,040
"It’s possible. The truth is I’m
a very impatient woman."

447
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,040
Sorry, Salva.

448
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,640
Excuse the joke, no...

449
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,400
I just wanted to make sure
you remembered about our date.

450
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,200
"The truth is
being stood up horrifies me."

451
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,520
I wouldn’t know what to do, how to get
out of here if you didn’t show up.

452
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:52,040
I guess I’d stay here
in my high heel shoes and on my own and...

453
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,840
drinking pints
until they told me to leave.

454
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,280
-Relentless.
-"No, embarrassed to death."

455
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,560
Don’t worry.

456
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,280
I’ll soon be with you
with those pints, in five minutes.

457
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,560
"See you very soon."

458
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,480
See you very soon.

459
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,120
"When you’re close to me,
I can’t even breathe."

460
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,080
Breathe then.

461
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,480
In nine months
you will not be able to breathe.

462
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,680
"It’s a joke, isn’t it?"

463
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,320
-Tell me it’s a joke.
-It’s not a joke.

464
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,680
-No, it’s not a joke.
-No.

465
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,040
Monica, I’m, technically,

466
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,680
I’m sterile.

467
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,960
"You must be Shiva,
the fertility goddess."

468
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,360
Shall I phone my wife, and the kids,
and we all go to celebrate it.

469
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,800
I told you that we had problems,
not that we were breaking up.

470
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,120
I brought you a menu,
you’ll be blown away.

471
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,440
Look, a sandwich that...

472
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,680
Well, I have eaten it a couple of times
and I’m still alive, so more or less...

473
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,760
Some biscuits, that...
I took the gluten free ones,

474
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,000
because I thought you might

475
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,600
-be gluten intolerant, as many people.
-Yes.

476
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,720
Perhaps, these better.

477
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,040
A chocolate pastry,
because I like them very much.

478
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,840
Ah, well, and...

479
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,760
Some sweets.

480
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,160
Do you want some?

481
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,720
"Hello, Raquel speaking.
I can’t answer your call right now.

482
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,320
If it’s urgent,
leave your message after the beep."

483
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,960
Raquel.

484
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,840
Raquel, it’s Ángel.

485
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Listen, I’m asking you to reconsider.

486
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,520
Look, I can understand your rage.

487
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,840
I also overdid it, but...

488
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,440
Blimey, this is not the first row
we have had, you and I, is it?

489
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,080
Look...

490
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,960
I’m probably an asshole
or whatever you want, but...

491
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,880
but I’m not the mole.

492
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,720
I’m not the mole, for fuck’s sake.

493
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,600
You’ll screw my life up, Raquel.

494
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,120
You’ll screw my life up, damn it.

495
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,480
Give me a call.

496
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,080
What do you think about,
on the morning before a robbery?

497
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,280
You get up and, what’s on your mind?

498
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,320
I don’t know.

499
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,800
You get up there, at dawn,

500
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,440
"you smoke,

501
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,360
talk about nonsense."

502
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,120
What on earth are you doing
smoking so early?

503
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,160
Here we go, said the pot to the kettle.

504
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,600
-How are you?
-Fine.

505
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,880
And you?

506
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,520
Nothing extraordinary.

507
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,200
A lot of courage is needed.

508
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,280
I say it because I think
about that kind of things, you know?

509
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,560
About people who are on death row

510
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,680
or those guys that go in a rat hole,
shooting around.

511
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,320
-It’s not that bad.
-Yes.

512
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,040
It is. A very cowardly person
is telling you.

513
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,120
Look at me,

514
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,920
with a married man to avoid failure

515
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,400
or being dumped.

516
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,880
-You’re no coward.
-I am.

517
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,240
-You’re not.
-Yes, I am.

518
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,320
You stole a mobile
in the middle of a robbery.

519
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,480
You insisted on me shooting you
in your leg.

520
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,560
You stood firm before Berlin
who is crackers.

521
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,880
And you had the guts
to grab me by the neck and kiss me

522
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,520
and fuck me.

523
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,080
You need to have a lot of guts to bang
a loser wearing a Dali face mask.

524
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,280
You are Nikita, the secretary version.

525
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,200
Actually, the morning of the heist

526
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,680
I was scared to death.

527
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,400
"A fucking crazy thing."

528
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,000
-What?
-All this stuff, dad.

529
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,360
This guy...

530
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,480
He may look very clever, but...

531
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,840
-I don’t know, it’s crazy shit.
-No, it isn’t, no.

532
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,400
At least he knows what he’s talking about.

533
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,360
I started to doubt everything.

534
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,680
-I don’t know what I’m doing here.
-You’re with me.

535
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,160
But the thing is that everyone
is an expert in something.

536
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,480
So, the woman that fakes the banknotes.
You that...

537
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:41,400
You are a wizard at what you do, but I...
I haven’t done anything good in my life.

538
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,440
But he's a really good guy.

539
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,120
He told me he needed me and here I am,

540
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,360
meeting the most beautiful girl
in all this crazy stuff.

541
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,480
One minute.

542
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,720
"These are the tools we managed to steal.

543
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,720
Get undressed and tape them to your body
with insulating tape

544
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,960
to take them to the basement,
and untie yourselves.

545
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,960
Cut the ducts in the boilers room
and anything you can use as a weapon.

546
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,080
At 9 PM they’ll take your dinner down.
Take that chance

547
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:47,080
to disarm your captors and escape.
We’ll meet up at the warehouse,

548
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,800
hidden behind the coils.

549
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,440
I’ll try to take as many hostages
as possible without compromising the plan.

550
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,560
One second.

551
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,520
Out.

552
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,520
Thank goodness that I showed up.

553
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,640
As your date has stood you up...

554
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,440
Yes, yes.

555
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,080
I don’t know what would've happened to me
if you hadn’t showed up.

556
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,280
And your date,

557
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,240
were you particularly
interested in it or...?

558
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,440
No, not anymore.

559
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,840
What a shame.

560
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,840
What a shame.

561
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,240
Fine then, let’s see if I’m any good.

562
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,960
I’m sure you are.

563
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,200
Good, that makes me happy.

564
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,680
But I have something to confess

565
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,840
that we both are in danger, because...

566
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,440
if I have another one of these,
I may start to hum "muñeiras".

567
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,480
And we’ll have a problem.

568
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,880
I’m sure you look very funny.

569
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,680
When will we start addressing each other
less formally?

570
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,280
When you look at me under the table.

571
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,520
Come on, Salva.

572
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,240
Have a peep.

573
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,640
Look at me under the table.

574
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,280
I warn you that if you’re going to do
like in "Basic Instinct",

575
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,760
I might need something stronger,
because I’m a little conservative.

576
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,320
Salva, listen to me.

577
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,680
I don’t want you to make a scene here.

578
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,840
I’m quite sure
that you’re hiding something

579
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,200
in that workshop
where you supposedly make cider.

580
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,360
So either:

581
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,680
you willingly take me there

582
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,320
or we wait here
until I get a search warrant,

583
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,680
but I’m warning you
it could take a couple of hours.

584
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,720
So...

585
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,680
you choose.
