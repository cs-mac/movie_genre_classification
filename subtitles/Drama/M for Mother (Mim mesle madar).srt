<i>When Soo Jin</i>

3
00:00:20,891 --> 00:00:25,061
<i>was abandoned alone at the tree
in front of the orphanage...</i>

4
00:00:25,784 --> 00:00:27,253
<i>she was...</i>

5
00:00:27,808 --> 00:00:28,808
<i>never able to forget...</i>

6
00:00:29,347 --> 00:00:31,652
<i>how she was back then.</i>

7
00:00:32,354 --> 00:00:35,780
<i>And as she grew up,
she remained that child.</i>

8
00:00:36,552 --> 00:00:39,207
<i>I never knew that having
to leave Hye Na behind...</i>

9
00:00:41,777 --> 00:00:44,922
<i>I had to do what
I dreaded doing most...</i>

10
00:00:45,506 --> 00:00:48,377
to my own child,
with my own hands...

11
00:00:48,946 --> 00:00:50,294
and that was so...

12
00:00:52,505 --> 00:00:54,652
so, so painful.

13
00:00:54,652 --> 00:00:57,056
A woman only truly
becomes a mother...

14
00:00:58,631 --> 00:01:01,023
when she offers her all...

15
00:01:01,597 --> 00:01:04,740
to another tiny creature.

16
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,788
If I were to turn back time
and go back to that moment...

17
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,454
I would probably take
that child's hand...

18
00:01:16,139 --> 00:01:18,930
and run away again.

19
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,913
The only thing that Hye Na's biological
mother did, was give birth to her.

20
00:01:21,913 --> 00:01:23,711
But she's not a mom.

21
00:01:24,874 --> 00:01:26,785
My Soo Jin...

22
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:28,969
is her real mother.

23
00:01:31,148 --> 00:01:33,380
Defendant Kang Soo Jin.

24
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:37,207
I sentence you to
36 months of probation.

25
00:01:42,487 --> 00:01:44,454
Furthermore, during your probation

26
00:01:44,454 --> 00:01:46,556
as a protective measure

27
00:01:46,556 --> 00:01:50,068
you are hereby forbidden from
interacting with Ms. Kim Hye Na.

28
00:01:56,556 --> 00:01:58,556
<i>[Episode 15]</i>

29
00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:04,663
Why did you discharge yourself
from the hospital?

30
00:02:04,663 --> 00:02:08,913
Does this mean that you've
given up on living?

31
00:02:08,913 --> 00:02:10,922
You're saying that you won't use
the breathing machine

32
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:14,222
and are refusing CPR
and chemotherapy?

33
00:02:14,222 --> 00:02:16,584
How could yo do this to us, Mom?

34
00:02:16,584 --> 00:02:17,621
Yi Jin.

35
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:19,864
Your mom has the right
to do that if she wishes.

36
00:02:19,864 --> 00:02:23,308
She's struggled all her life
for your sake.

37
00:02:23,308 --> 00:02:25,941
They said that her receiving
treatment now...

38
00:02:26,612 --> 00:02:29,048
will do nothing more than
prolong her life a bit more.

39
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:30,284
So?

40
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:34,412
Are you two saying that
you're giving up on Mom?

41
00:02:34,412 --> 00:02:36,488
I can't do that.

42
00:02:36,488 --> 00:02:38,386
I'm going to save Mom!

43
00:02:38,386 --> 00:02:39,830
I'm going to use any means necessary

44
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,995
changing her diet
or whatever, to save her!

45
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,787
- Big Sis.
- Yi Jin.

46
00:02:57,245 --> 00:03:00,638
I've decided that this will be
the place where I will die.

47
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:05,261
I don't want to die in an ICU
that feels like a storage closet.

48
00:03:05,941 --> 00:03:09,110
I hate the look in the eyes of the people
who work at the hospital.

49
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,382
There's not a single honest person there.

50
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:15,683
Their concerned faces remind me of
the faces of department store workers.

51
00:03:17,511 --> 00:03:21,645
I just want to die in my own house
while I can still think clearly.

52
00:03:22,138 --> 00:03:23,955
Can't I do that, my daughter?

53
00:03:38,781 --> 00:03:41,886
"Everything is as it was before."

54
00:03:41,886 --> 00:03:45,223
"The hands on the clock,
which moved with a tick tock sound"

55
00:03:45,223 --> 00:03:46,921
"were also the same as before."

56
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,714
"But when the children stepped
over the threshold"

57
00:03:50,714 --> 00:03:54,244
"they realized that they
had become adults."

58
00:03:57,072 --> 00:03:58,531
Soo Jin.

59
00:04:00,391 --> 00:04:01,894
When I die...

60
00:04:02,517 --> 00:04:04,221
go to your mother.

61
00:04:05,877 --> 00:04:08,284
And change your family registry,
so you're registered as her child.

62
00:04:08,762 --> 00:04:11,216
And if I were you,
I'd also change my name.

63
00:04:11,216 --> 00:04:12,904
To Nam Soo Jin.

64
00:04:14,137 --> 00:04:16,038
What are you saying?

65
00:04:18,896 --> 00:04:20,683
I told you, right?

66
00:04:21,471 --> 00:04:23,117
I promised you

67
00:04:23,117 --> 00:04:26,233
that I'd let you go
if your mom showed up.

68
00:04:28,038 --> 00:04:29,752
I know that...

69
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:33,238
you were never truly my daughter.

70
00:04:33,925 --> 00:04:36,033
I thought that you would be

71
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:38,606
if I just loved you more and more.

72
00:04:39,776 --> 00:04:41,988
But I was thinking only of myself.

73
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:45,310
Go.

74
00:04:45,978 --> 00:04:47,250
Go, and...

75
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,346
act as if none of this ever happened.

76
00:04:52,495 --> 00:04:54,610
As if you were never abandoned...

77
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,673
or abandoned anyone.

78
00:04:58,985 --> 00:05:00,377
Live your life like that.

79
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:02,675
I am Kang Soo Jin.

80
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:06,147
That's who I've always been,
and that is who I will continue to be.

81
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:09,921
I have never not been
your daughter, Mom.

82
00:05:10,865 --> 00:05:12,509
You know as well as I do...

83
00:05:13,002 --> 00:05:16,262
that I just failed to mature
and grow up for too long.

84
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,678
Please don't kick me out, Mom.

85
00:05:21,247 --> 00:05:23,462
Give me a chance.

86
00:05:26,002 --> 00:05:28,154
I know that you're only saying this...

87
00:05:29,045 --> 00:05:31,856
because you feel bad for me
since I'm dying.

88
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,932
But it's still nice to hear.

89
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:47,697
<i>Today, I'll tell you about Tae Hwa,
a boy at the facility I live at.</i>

90
00:05:48,197 --> 00:05:50,678
<i>Tae Hwa is six years old.</i>

91
00:05:50,678 --> 00:05:54,319
<i>He can't talk to strangers.</i>

92
00:05:54,891 --> 00:05:59,069
<i>His big sister died three months ago,
and was buried in the hills.</i>

93
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:03,637
<i>One day, Tae Hwa was kicked out of his
home while only dressed in underwear</i>

94
00:06:03,637 --> 00:06:06,625
<i>so he was sitting in front of
a kimbap store, crying.</i>

95
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:09,171
<i>And the lady there
came out and asked him</i>

96
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:11,925
<i>"Child, why are you crying?"</i>

97
00:06:11,925 --> 00:06:13,577
<i>"Are you hungry?"</i>

98
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:18,118
<i>"I want to eat fried pork chops.
I want to eat kimbap."</i>

99
00:06:18,118 --> 00:06:20,620
<i>"I want to eat spicy rice cakes."</i>

100
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,966
<i>That's what Tae Hwa wanted to say.</i>

101
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:28,639
<i>But apparently, he couldn't
say that, and he just cried.</i>

102
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,474
<i>But thankfully, that woman
gave him some fried pork chops</i>

103
00:06:32,474 --> 00:06:35,146
<i>and some kimbap,
and some spicy rice cakes, too.</i>

104
00:06:35,653 --> 00:06:39,445
<i>And she reported this to the police,
so he was allowed to come here.</i>

105
00:06:40,908 --> 00:06:43,284
<i>[I want to eat fried pork chops.

<i>[I want to eat spicy...]</i>

107
00:06:45,803 --> 00:06:48,721
<i>Tae Hwa is going to be
adopted soon.</i>

108
00:06:48,721 --> 00:06:51,745
<i>So he has been practicing talking a lot.</i>

109
00:06:52,272 --> 00:06:55,964
<i>Because it'll be bad if he can't
talk to his new mom and dad.</i>

110
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:02,098
<i>I won't get adopted.</i>

111
00:07:02,776 --> 00:07:06,286
<i>I definitely won't let that happen.</i>

112
00:07:06,286 --> 00:07:11,574
<i>And if it does, I won't say
a single word until the day I die.</i>

plus my New Year's money.

Thanks.
I'll do my best.

00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,056
<i>This is our home now.</i>

161
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:27,807
<i>You, me, and Mom are going to
live here together.</i>

162
00:11:49,135 --> 00:11:50,888
Come and eat, Big Sis!

163
00:11:50,888 --> 00:11:53,519
"The jewels of our father"

164
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,285
"with wash'd eyes Cordelia leaves you."

165
00:11:56,285 --> 00:11:59,330
"I know you what you are."

166
00:11:59,818 --> 00:12:00,967
Big Sis!

167
00:12:01,985 --> 00:12:03,601
Come eat lunch.

168
00:12:03,601 --> 00:12:04,724
Yi Jin.

169
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,655
I'll let her go after
she finishes Act 1.

170
00:12:06,655 --> 00:12:08,053
I'll be done soon.

171
00:12:11,817 --> 00:12:14,152
"And like a sister am
most loath to call..."

172
00:12:17,163 --> 00:12:18,842
Hyun Jin!

173
00:12:19,495 --> 00:12:21,721
What is she doing
in her room?

174
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:25,832
<i>- Happy birthday to you!
- Happy birthday to you!</i>

175
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,818
<i>What did you wish for?</i>

176
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,884
<i>That the baby could
be our baby.</i>

177
00:12:41,884 --> 00:12:43,610
<i>What do you mean by that?</i>

178
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,841
<i>Yi Jin is already our baby.</i>

179
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,316
<i>I don't want Yi Jin
to be adopted like me</i>

180
00:12:49,316 --> 00:12:52,490
<i>I want her to be your real daughter, Mom.</i>

181
00:12:53,192 --> 00:12:55,134
<i>If the baby finds out later...</i>

182
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,182
<i>that her real mother
abandoned her...</i>

183
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,064
<i>what will we do then?</i>

184
00:13:02,064 --> 00:13:04,865
<i>Are you worried that she'll have
a difficult time later, like you did?</i>

185
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,952
<i>All right.</i>

186
00:13:09,564 --> 00:13:13,519
<i>Let's say that Yi Jin is a child
I gave birth to myself.</i>

187
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,586
<i>Nobody will know
unless we say something.</i>

188
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:18,302
<i>You can keep this a secret, right?</i>

189
00:13:18,302 --> 00:13:19,460
What is this?

190
00:13:24,756 --> 00:13:26,150
Where... did you get this?

191
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:31,630
Who is that?

192
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:34,633
That's... not me.

193
00:13:43,643 --> 00:13:44,681
<i>[Baek Yi Yeon]</i>

194
00:13:50,575 --> 00:13:52,998
<i>[Certificate of Adoption]</i>

195
00:13:58,308 --> 00:13:59,779
Big Sis.

196
00:14:17,592 --> 00:14:18,731
Was this fun for you two...

197
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,480
all this time?

198
00:14:23,255 --> 00:14:27,832
How could you toy with a person
like this for their entire life?

199
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,160
Yi Jin.

200
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,835
It wasn't like that.

201
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:42,088
I was the one who asked Mom to do it.

202
00:14:42,755 --> 00:14:44,718
Because I didn't want you
to end up like me.

203
00:14:45,577 --> 00:14:48,231
After I was on that TV program with Mom

204
00:14:48,231 --> 00:14:50,972
everyone pitied me,
no matter where I went.

205
00:14:52,144 --> 00:14:54,224
I didn't want you to end up like that.

206
00:14:54,224 --> 00:14:56,610
I wanted to protect you
more than anyone else.

207
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,134
But you knew that...

208
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:03,870
the one thing I was proud of
was that I was Mom's biological daughter.

209
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:05,748
How did you feel...

210
00:15:06,274 --> 00:15:08,494
as you watched me,
living like that?

211
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,645
What were you planning to do
if I ever found out?

212
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,614
I was being inconsiderate.

213
00:15:15,692 --> 00:15:18,390
I think that I thought
I could protect you forever.

214
00:15:19,405 --> 00:15:22,287
But that's not protecting me, Big Sis!

215
00:15:22,761 --> 00:15:25,337
That's ruining me!

216
00:15:26,494 --> 00:15:29,495
All of you, get out.
I need to talk to Yi Jin.

217
00:15:30,211 --> 00:15:32,255
No, stay in here.
All of you.

218
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:34,436
Just say it in front of everyone.

219
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:39,263
And don't say that I'm
your real daughter if you raised me.

220
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,072
Tell me the truth.

221
00:15:44,073 --> 00:15:47,437
I don't want to be played
like a fool any longer.

222
00:15:53,131 --> 00:15:55,621
From the moment that I first saw you

223
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,660
I thought of you as my baby.

224
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,432
And that's why the adoption process
was so difficult for me.

225
00:16:01,432 --> 00:16:03,170
And I had to wait
for a very long time.

226
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:06,457
Do I not have the right
to be your real mother

227
00:16:06,457 --> 00:16:09,099
for the sole reason that
I didn't give birth to you?

228
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,759
Even though you were my first baby?

229
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:15,904
Even though I raised you with my own
hands, from the very beginning?

230
00:16:15,904 --> 00:16:20,568
Even though I'd completely forgotten
that I didn't give birth to you?

231
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:28,965
Yi Jin.

232
00:16:29,862 --> 00:16:31,628
Please, hold Mom's hand.

233
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:37,688
Let's hold hands and talk
like before, okay?

234
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:40,952
Come now, my good daughter.

235
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:34,101
<i>Mom.</i>

236
00:17:34,101 --> 00:17:36,045
<i>I got a map.</i>

237
00:17:36,045 --> 00:17:37,920
<i>And I figured out the way.</i>

238
00:17:46,267 --> 00:17:48,695
<i>I packed my bag...</i>

239
00:17:49,397 --> 00:17:52,314
<i>and I just need a bit more money.</i>

240
00:17:53,196 --> 00:17:57,410
<i>29,000 minus 14,000 won is...</i>

241
00:17:58,986 --> 00:18:02,417
<i>I think I only need about
20,000 won more.</i>

242
00:18:04,006 --> 00:18:05,966
<i>How do I get that?</i>

243
00:18:23,597 --> 00:18:26,800
<i>I think the baby is happy
because you're feeding her.</i>

244
00:18:28,127 --> 00:18:30,470
<i>Do you like your Big Sis, Yi Jin?</i>

245
00:18:33,172 --> 00:18:34,834
Oh, you're so happy!

246
00:18:36,531 --> 00:18:39,039
<i>Soo Jin, come over here.</i>

247
00:18:41,659 --> 00:18:46,561
<i>Ring, ring, get out of the way.</i>

248
00:18:46,561 --> 00:18:49,806
<i>I want her to be
your real baby, Mom.</i>

249
00:18:51,348 --> 00:18:55,890
<i>If the baby finds out later
that her real mother abandoned her...</i>

250
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,713
<i>what will we do then?</i>

251
00:18:58,273 --> 00:19:00,456
<i>I asked Mom to do it.</i>

252
00:19:01,005 --> 00:19:03,146
<i>Because I didn't want you
to end up like me.</i>

253
00:19:03,146 --> 00:19:05,328
<i>I didn't want you to end up like that.</i>

254
00:19:05,328 --> 00:19:07,678
<i>I wanted to protect you
more than anyone else.</i>

255
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,608
Yi Jin.

256
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:54,335
I'm going to make
soybean paste soup and grill some fish.

257
00:19:55,379 --> 00:19:56,551
Okay.

258
00:19:57,389 --> 00:19:59,369
I'm still angry.

259
00:19:59,978 --> 00:20:02,680
I'm angry at Mom...

260
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,485
and I'm angry at you too, Big Sis.

261
00:20:07,254 --> 00:20:09,745
And I'm angry at myself, most of all.

262
00:20:11,946 --> 00:20:13,347
I'm sorry.

263
00:20:15,157 --> 00:20:19,218
So when I make food and call you down,
come and eat immediately.

264
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,996
So you can eat it while it's still hot.

265
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:34,322
You know that I seldom apologize, right?

266
00:20:35,437 --> 00:20:36,554
Yes.

267
00:20:39,168 --> 00:20:40,795
But, I'm sorry.

268
00:20:42,853 --> 00:20:45,341
I'm really sorry that I hurt you.

269
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,324
As I was growing up...

270
00:20:52,438 --> 00:20:55,457
I was always worried that I fell short...

271
00:20:56,045 --> 00:20:57,689
as your daughter, Mom.

272
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:59,950
That's why...

273
00:21:01,554 --> 00:21:04,662
I think I was wishing that...

274
00:21:06,103 --> 00:21:07,926
I was a daughter you'd given birth to.

275
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,082
All the moments in which I was so proud
of you while you were growing up

276
00:21:12,082 --> 00:21:15,133
so much so that I felt as if
my heart would burst...

277
00:21:15,133 --> 00:21:17,351
I remember all of them.

278
00:21:17,351 --> 00:21:20,285
The first day that
you called me "Mom."

279
00:21:21,335 --> 00:21:23,927
The sight of you, as you
competed in a piano competition

280
00:21:23,927 --> 00:21:25,573
without being nervous at all.

281
00:21:26,268 --> 00:21:29,658
I was so nervous that day
that I took two anxiety pills.

282
00:21:31,105 --> 00:21:33,110
And the twins.

283
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:36,011
The day you insisted that
you'd have a natural birth

284
00:21:36,011 --> 00:21:38,456
after keeping them in your womb
for as long as you could.

285
00:21:38,456 --> 00:21:40,915
Remembering that makes me
tear up more than anything else.

286
00:21:42,611 --> 00:21:44,782
Hug me please, Yi Jin.

287
00:21:59,949 --> 00:22:02,226
This is a secret
from Big Sis, but...

288
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:07,473
Soo Jin has never made me
that happy before.

289
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,004
If I didn't have you...

290
00:22:10,535 --> 00:22:13,109
how would I have gotten by
all these years?

291
00:22:13,697 --> 00:22:16,451
Also...

292
00:22:16,451 --> 00:22:18,970
you're the one who takes
after me most in our family.

293
00:22:23,949 --> 00:22:25,576
I'm sorry, Mom.

294
00:22:26,719 --> 00:22:29,249
You're the person who's in
the most pain right now, and yet...

295
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,970
Oh yeah.

296
00:22:32,569 --> 00:22:34,850
Hurry and eat this.

297
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:37,227
It'll only taste good if you eat it
while it's still hot.

298
00:22:38,427 --> 00:22:40,691
Did you refrain from
putting any salt in it today, too?

299
00:22:41,395 --> 00:22:44,245
I used all natural ingredients
and natural seasonings

300
00:22:44,245 --> 00:22:45,900
so it doesn't need any salt.

301
00:22:50,824 --> 00:22:52,094
It tastes good.

302
00:22:55,275 --> 00:22:57,480
All right, slowly!

303
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,286
Good job!

304
00:23:00,899 --> 00:23:02,373
Be careful!

305
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:06,403
Enjoy the movie!

306
00:23:10,023 --> 00:23:12,691
<i>Hey!
Hey, wait!</i>

307
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,039
<i>I'm not going to do it!</i>

308
00:23:17,972 --> 00:23:20,823
- He's so funny!
- Wow!

309
00:23:22,283 --> 00:23:25,303
<i>I would like to formally greet you.</i>

310
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:28,964
<i>Well, um, it's nice to meet you.</i>

311
00:23:29,931 --> 00:23:35,120
<i>- Mom, why do we need to see him?
- Son, he will...</i>

312
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,572
Won't you take a seat?

313
00:23:57,174 --> 00:23:58,670
I'm comfortable standing.

314
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,514
You should really sit down.

315
00:24:01,068 --> 00:24:02,539
Take a seat.

316
00:24:19,732 --> 00:24:21,109
I'm not, either...

317
00:24:22,897 --> 00:24:24,672
am I?

318
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:29,100
Your biological daughter, I mean.

319
00:24:37,097 --> 00:24:38,696
You knew?

320
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:45,237
I only thought that
that might be the case.

321
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,149
I see.

322
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:52,205
But you know

323
00:24:52,205 --> 00:24:54,360
that wasn't important to me at all.

324
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,431
Because the three of us...

325
00:24:56,847 --> 00:25:00,300
received tons of love
from you while growing up.

326
00:25:03,417 --> 00:25:05,353
You're not curious about
your birth parents?

327
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,113
No.

328
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,505
You must be scared.

329
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,546
I...

330
00:25:13,405 --> 00:25:15,270
was always happy...

331
00:25:16,635 --> 00:25:18,617
being your daughter...

332
00:25:21,138 --> 00:25:23,114
and being my older sisters'
youngest sister.

333
00:25:24,684 --> 00:25:26,001
If...

334
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:29,985
I can just continue living
this way, I don't--

335
00:25:29,985 --> 00:25:31,698
Jae Beom...

336
00:25:33,537 --> 00:25:36,169
was always by our side,
as you know.

337
00:25:36,629 --> 00:25:38,946
He was so good to us.

338
00:25:39,443 --> 00:25:42,575
And it was all thanks to that
that I was able to raise you three.

339
00:25:44,492 --> 00:25:46,228
Let's stop here.

340
00:25:46,655 --> 00:25:48,714
One thing at a time, please.

341
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:53,339
Today, I found out that I'm
not your biological daughter

342
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:55,245
so tell me the rest another time.

343
00:25:56,579 --> 00:25:59,383
Tell me everything else slowly.

344
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,840
What's the matter?

345
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,464
Did something happen?

346
00:26:34,796 --> 00:26:36,151
Your mom...

347
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:38,651
asked Hyun Jin to come see her.

348
00:26:42,848 --> 00:26:44,411
She's going to tell her.

349
00:26:48,005 --> 00:26:49,751
That poor punk, Hyun Jin...

350
00:26:51,206 --> 00:26:53,191
I feel so bad for her.

351
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:56,018
If she finds out that
a guy like me is her father...

352
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:02,333
she'll be so humiliated.
How will she be able to go on?

353
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:04,101
Did you live a shameful life?

354
00:27:04,101 --> 00:27:08,645
You literally did everything and anything
for the sake of our family!

355
00:27:10,057 --> 00:27:11,273
I...

356
00:27:14,434 --> 00:27:16,907
have never thought of
Hyun Jin as my daughter.

357
00:27:18,505 --> 00:27:21,046
I mean, she doesn't
take after me at all!

358
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,267
She's so smart, and so kind.

359
00:27:26,267 --> 00:27:28,337
Merely watching her from the sidelines...

360
00:27:29,013 --> 00:27:30,299
was more than enough for me.

361
00:27:31,369 --> 00:27:32,620
Oh, man.

362
00:27:33,515 --> 00:27:35,200
Man, what do I do?

363
00:27:37,386 --> 00:27:39,142
Oh, I have no idea.

364
00:27:39,142 --> 00:27:42,020
Should I leave the house, or...

365
00:27:42,583 --> 00:27:45,825
will we be able to live on, like this?

366
00:27:46,578 --> 00:27:48,628
It'll take some time

367
00:27:48,628 --> 00:27:50,747
but she'll understand, and accept it.

368
00:27:50,747 --> 00:27:52,045
Soo Jin.

369
00:27:56,143 --> 00:27:58,107
Please help my Hyun Jin.

370
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:00,977
Please help her...

371
00:28:02,203 --> 00:28:03,602
so that she isn't too shocked.

372
00:28:07,622 --> 00:28:08,857
Help her, okay?

373
00:28:17,592 --> 00:28:19,180
Can I come in?

374
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,437
Did you...

375
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,849
know about this, too?

376
00:28:44,002 --> 00:28:45,864
Vaguely.

377
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,789
Soo Jin.

378
00:28:50,276 --> 00:28:54,408
<i>At first, Mister would bring
you over in the morning</i>

379
00:28:54,408 --> 00:28:55,966
<i>and take you back home at night.</i>

380
00:28:56,728 --> 00:29:01,544
<i>But after a while, you started
living at our house.</i>

381
00:29:01,544 --> 00:29:03,499
<i>And Mom told me...</i>

382
00:29:03,499 --> 00:29:06,070
<i>that, from now on,
you were my younger sister.</i>

383
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:08,455
<i>And that we should tell
people that from now on, too.</i>

384
00:29:10,069 --> 00:29:12,628
I think that...

385
00:29:12,628 --> 00:29:15,312
it was too difficult for
Mister to raise you on his own.

386
00:29:16,341 --> 00:29:20,141
So Mom told him that you should
be raised with the rest of us.

387
00:29:22,838 --> 00:29:24,997
And around the time that
you were in kindergarten...

388
00:29:25,848 --> 00:29:28,166
I think you officially
became our younger sister.

389
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:32,329
I was so happy.

390
00:29:34,184 --> 00:29:36,557
You were so pretty...

391
00:29:36,557 --> 00:29:39,237
I even got up in the middle of
the night sometimes to look at you.

392
00:29:40,206 --> 00:29:42,706
We all loved you so much.

393
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,177
We loved you for being you...

394
00:29:46,948 --> 00:29:48,796
and didn't care about
whose daughter you were.

395
00:29:53,201 --> 00:29:54,674
Are you disappointed?

396
00:30:02,323 --> 00:30:03,323
No.

397
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,237
I'm okay.

398
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,274
Because I'm the same as my older sisters.

399
00:30:13,953 --> 00:30:15,373
I just...

400
00:30:16,464 --> 00:30:18,559
feel so bad for Mr. Jae Beom.

401
00:30:20,107 --> 00:30:23,619
He took me to school and picked me up
every morning and night...

402
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:27,943
and he was so happy
during my graduations.

403
00:30:28,439 --> 00:30:30,998
And when I was hired
at the newspaper...

404
00:30:30,998 --> 00:30:33,069
Mister cried.

405
00:30:36,632 --> 00:30:38,957
Mister would always do something
for me on my birthday...

406
00:30:39,831 --> 00:30:42,430
and I hated that so much, but...

407
00:30:44,668 --> 00:30:47,287
if anything, I think I knew.

408
00:30:50,735 --> 00:30:52,766
That I was...

409
00:30:56,216 --> 00:30:58,922
quite an important person to Mister.

410
00:31:01,963 --> 00:31:04,049
That I could...

411
00:31:05,819 --> 00:31:07,976
cause Mister pain.

412
00:31:15,324 --> 00:31:17,310
My silly younger sister.

413
00:31:26,239 --> 00:31:27,589
But...

414
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,262
I don't think I'll be able to start
calling him "Dad" right away.

415
00:31:35,342 --> 00:31:37,360
Tell Mister that...

416
00:31:39,476 --> 00:31:40,597
I want us...

417
00:31:41,256 --> 00:31:44,479
to be the same as we were before.

418
00:31:46,348 --> 00:31:47,561
All right.

419
00:32:58,565 --> 00:33:00,444
Are you okay?

420
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,418
I'm talking about Yoon Bok.

421
00:33:06,686 --> 00:33:08,252
You miss her, don't you?

422
00:33:16,136 --> 00:33:18,267
I convince myself every day...

423
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:22,314
that it couldn't be helped.

424
00:33:25,757 --> 00:33:28,333
Yoon Bok has to live her own life now.

425
00:33:30,064 --> 00:33:31,540
Yes, she does.

426
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,505
I miss you.

427
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:39,036
Your eight-year-old self.

428
00:33:39,627 --> 00:33:41,703
Your nine-year-old self.

429
00:33:43,142 --> 00:33:45,292
You, as you were back then, every day.

430
00:34:16,825 --> 00:34:18,184
What time is it now?

431
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:23,206
2:30.

432
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,919
I have a favor to ask of you.

433
00:34:31,367 --> 00:34:33,733
It's kind of a difficult request.

434
00:34:33,733 --> 00:34:35,512
But you must do this for me.

435
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,720
Because it might be my last request.

436
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:40,961
What is it?

437
00:34:42,979 --> 00:34:45,166
Go and meet with Jung Jin Hong.

438
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,664
And go for a drive.

439
00:34:46,664 --> 00:34:48,744
I've already told him you would.

440
00:34:49,173 --> 00:34:50,204
What?

441
00:34:56,441 --> 00:35:00,544
I'm not good at lying,
so I'll just be honest with you.

442
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,519
I asked the woman
who gave birth to you...

443
00:35:05,077 --> 00:35:08,477
to come, and in a very polite way.

444
00:35:10,157 --> 00:35:12,883
I just don't want you
anywhere near here.

445
00:35:12,883 --> 00:35:14,823
Go on a drive and go
far, far away from here.

446
00:35:17,486 --> 00:35:18,992
I don't want to do this, either.

447
00:35:19,459 --> 00:35:20,747
I don't want to, but...

448
00:35:22,602 --> 00:35:25,555
I need to sort out
my affairs before I die.

449
00:35:56,323 --> 00:36:00,081
<i>[Mooryung Station]</i>

450
00:36:12,331 --> 00:36:14,334
Thank you for coming.

451
00:36:14,334 --> 00:36:15,702
What do you mean?

452
00:36:16,405 --> 00:36:18,698
I'm the one who should be thankful.

453
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:22,827
I've been wanting
to formally pay you my respects.

454
00:36:24,445 --> 00:36:26,334
But I was too ashamed.

455
00:36:26,914 --> 00:36:28,856
I was curious...

456
00:36:29,537 --> 00:36:31,153
about what kind of person you were.

457
00:36:31,858 --> 00:36:33,472
And where my Soo Jin's...

458
00:36:34,247 --> 00:36:36,017
eyes, nose, and lips...

459
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:38,945
come from.

460
00:36:40,521 --> 00:36:42,619
Her stubborn nature.

461
00:36:43,412 --> 00:36:45,662
And her cold and
unaffectionate personality.

462
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:50,191
Her intelligence, and cleverness.

463
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:53,117
It must have been so rough on you.

464
00:36:53,865 --> 00:36:55,412
Thank you.

465
00:36:55,412 --> 00:36:56,963
So, so much.

466
00:37:01,814 --> 00:37:04,236
There's no need for you to thank me

467
00:37:04,236 --> 00:37:06,927
for having raised my own child.

468
00:37:08,369 --> 00:37:12,930
To be honest, I have a favor to ask,
which is why I asked you to come.

469
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:20,285
Yi Jin is quite angry.

470
00:37:20,285 --> 00:37:23,131
She can't accept the fact that
Mom is going to pass away.

471
00:37:23,669 --> 00:37:25,671
Hyun Jin is sad.

472
00:37:26,798 --> 00:37:29,483
She's someone who accepts
everything without resisting...

473
00:37:30,753 --> 00:37:32,470
so she is quite sad.

474
00:37:34,521 --> 00:37:36,441
And, as for me...

475
00:37:37,258 --> 00:37:38,706
I'm full of regret.

476
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,791
While I was spending time
with Yoon Bok...

477
00:37:44,448 --> 00:37:47,184
I thought of Mom.

478
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,863
I wondered how my mom lived her life.

479
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,046
And thought about how much
she must have cried because of me.

480
00:37:54,046 --> 00:37:57,287
And whether things were
difficult or upsetting for her.

481
00:37:59,224 --> 00:38:01,030
When I told Mom all that time...

482
00:38:01,809 --> 00:38:04,814
to give me up, to let me go

483
00:38:04,814 --> 00:38:06,669
and that I didn't need her...

484
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:10,057
Mom still held on to me.

485
00:38:11,483 --> 00:38:13,936
She didn't give one inch...

486
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:17,410
and was always there.

487
00:38:19,086 --> 00:38:21,430
Now, when I look at Mom...

488
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:26,648
When I see my lioness-like mother,
who was always full of fiery energy...

489
00:38:28,084 --> 00:38:30,994
reduced to such
a withered, sickly state...

490
00:38:34,253 --> 00:38:36,486
it feels like it was all my fault.

491
00:38:38,068 --> 00:38:39,756
When I die...

492
00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:43,869
please become my Soo Jin's mother.

493
00:38:45,809 --> 00:38:47,624
As I am at death's doorstep...

494
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,361
I feel so sorry for my kids.

495
00:38:52,546 --> 00:38:54,001
But a thought occurred to me...

496
00:38:54,492 --> 00:38:55,983
that, even if I die...

497
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,604
my Soo Jin, at the very least,
will still be able to have a mother.

498
00:39:02,184 --> 00:39:05,050
I don't know how I'll make
you feel by saying this...

499
00:39:07,256 --> 00:39:09,559
but Soo Jin is all grown up now

500
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:12,122
so I don't think that
she needs a mom anymore.

501
00:39:12,827 --> 00:39:14,682
She and I crossed paths
for only a short while

502
00:39:14,682 --> 00:39:17,972
but you truly raised your daughter
to be a great person.

503
00:39:19,294 --> 00:39:21,923
The reason why I lived nearby...

504
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:26,541
was because I had nowhere to go
after I got out of jail.

505
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:31,733
It wasn't so that I could have
a relationship with Soo Jin.

506
00:39:33,736 --> 00:39:35,356
You two are so alike.

507
00:39:36,019 --> 00:39:38,381
I understand now, after hearing you talk.

508
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,552
To be honest...

509
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,720
I was jealous of you.

510
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:52,079
I've wanted a child
ever since I was younger.

511
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,573
But it didn't work out.

512
00:39:54,573 --> 00:39:57,693
The only regret that I've had in life...

513
00:39:58,477 --> 00:40:00,789
was that I did not give
birth to my Soo Jin.

514
00:40:02,407 --> 00:40:04,970
And the person I was most envious of...

515
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:08,412
was the person who did give birth to her.

516
00:40:12,439 --> 00:40:15,088
Do you know what my plan is?

517
00:40:15,088 --> 00:40:19,144
I'm sure that you two
will meet up after I die.

518
00:40:20,693 --> 00:40:22,593
It's only natural.

519
00:40:23,271 --> 00:40:28,276
Because you two are tied together
by the toughest bond in the world.

520
00:40:29,852 --> 00:40:32,019
You two will end up meeting...

521
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,684
so...

522
00:40:34,713 --> 00:40:36,691
let's just let it be...

523
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:39,381
that you two are meeting
because I asked you to.

524
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,590
To fulfill my request.

525
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:46,637
That's the only way I will be at peace.

526
00:40:48,838 --> 00:40:51,227
I'm the one who has the upper hand, here.

527
00:40:51,227 --> 00:40:54,026
After all, I got to enjoy the most
precious moments of Soo Jin's life...

528
00:40:54,026 --> 00:40:57,222
and I'm just handing over the husk
after sucking out all of the sweetness.

529
00:41:04,644 --> 00:41:05,919
I...

530
00:41:06,898 --> 00:41:09,140
brought something.

531
00:41:22,858 --> 00:41:25,291
I thought it'd be best for me
to give it to you

532
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:28,383
than to hold on to it myself, Ma'am.

533
00:42:43,423 --> 00:42:44,722
You're back?

534
00:42:46,673 --> 00:42:49,108
She's going to be staying for dinner.

535
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:52,867
And she's going to be trimming
my hair a bit for me, too.

536
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:56,722
Call Jae Beom and tell him
to come by for dinner.

537
00:42:56,722 --> 00:42:59,405
I haven't seen him around at all.
Did he go somewhere?

538
00:42:59,914 --> 00:43:02,541
I'd like it if everyone
could be here today.

539
00:43:40,698 --> 00:43:43,048
Wow, isn't she so cute?

540
00:43:44,061 --> 00:43:45,633
- Look at this.
- Take a look at this.

541
00:43:46,758 --> 00:43:49,153
Soo Jin was at her prettiest
when she was a baby!

542
00:43:49,153 --> 00:43:50,867
What was this, Big Sis?

543
00:43:50,867 --> 00:43:52,231
You look so cute!

544
00:43:52,231 --> 00:43:53,269
I want to see.

545
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,140
I want to see, too!

546
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:59,854
Hey, don't fight!

547
00:43:59,854 --> 00:44:01,990
You don't remember this, do you?

548
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,177
I didn't want to forget your face

549
00:44:06,177 --> 00:44:08,800
so I took you to a photographer's
studio to get your photo taken.

550
00:44:15,566 --> 00:44:17,552
All right, face this way!

551
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:21,465
Smile.

552
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:23,443
Smile.

553
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:25,905
All right, I'll be taking it now.

554
00:44:25,905 --> 00:44:28,191
One, two, three!

555
00:44:35,327 --> 00:44:38,084
You're so young, and yet
you're so good at cooking!

556
00:44:38,084 --> 00:44:42,256
Oh, I've been cooking since
I was 15 years old, you see.

557
00:44:42,256 --> 00:44:44,827
Big Sis didn't come home that often

558
00:44:44,827 --> 00:44:48,666
and I thought she might come home
if I made some delicious food for her.

559
00:44:48,666 --> 00:44:50,396
I know, Yi Jin.

560
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:53,727
I know that the fact that I
ran away from home abruptly

561
00:44:53,727 --> 00:44:55,823
and didn't come back home much...

562
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:58,233
upset you quite a lot.

563
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:03,265
I know that you were mad at me
for a long time because of that.

564
00:45:03,265 --> 00:45:04,646
Is that what it was?

565
00:45:04,646 --> 00:45:07,760
I was just so happy that Big Sis
made food for me out of nowhere.

566
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,561
Looks like this only
ended up benefiting me.

567
00:45:10,907 --> 00:45:13,702
I didn't want to go out
for dinner, or order food.

568
00:45:13,702 --> 00:45:16,559
I wanted all of us
to sit and eat together.

569
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:19,151
You know, so that we would have
a real homey feeling.

570
00:45:19,151 --> 00:45:22,260
My Yi Jin is quite skilled at cooking.

571
00:45:22,927 --> 00:45:24,901
No matter how many people come over

572
00:45:24,901 --> 00:45:28,298
she's able to set up a feast just
by rummaging through the fridge.

573
00:45:28,298 --> 00:45:30,503
Try doing that in other places, too.

574
00:45:30,503 --> 00:45:32,561
Feeding the needy and such.

575
00:45:32,561 --> 00:45:36,883
Also, to be honest, I thought that
you girls liked those things.

576
00:45:37,506 --> 00:45:40,762
Going out for dinner
or ordering food, I mean.

577
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:43,358
Mom.

578
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:46,631
I was happy just as long
as you were by my side.

579
00:45:46,631 --> 00:45:48,854
You have a magical power, after all.

580
00:45:48,854 --> 00:45:51,503
Even just by saying,
"Look at that pebble over there"

581
00:45:51,503 --> 00:45:54,691
somehow you make that pebble
seem so magical.

582
00:45:56,331 --> 00:45:58,765
When Mom sat at the end of the table

583
00:45:58,765 --> 00:46:04,443
and said things like "King Lear died
today and Norah ran away from home"

584
00:46:04,443 --> 00:46:07,847
I thought that King Lear and
Norah were real people.

585
00:46:09,827 --> 00:46:12,079
I feel like it must have been
really fun when you were all young.

586
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,771
When we were younger, Big Sis
was like our mom.

587
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:17,856
She gave us allowance
and looked over our homework.

588
00:46:17,856 --> 00:46:20,675
And cut all of our fingernails
and toenails for us.

589
00:46:20,675 --> 00:46:23,829
And she'd find the kids bullying
us at school, and hit them.

590
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,814
It was fun.

591
00:46:26,814 --> 00:46:28,697
I liked the fact that
it was the three of us.

592
00:46:28,697 --> 00:46:30,108
Yeah.

593
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:32,269
And...

594
00:46:33,695 --> 00:46:37,383
you were just like a father
to us, Mr. Jae Beom.

595
00:46:38,035 --> 00:46:41,189
It would have been so much tougher
for us if you hadn't been around.

596
00:46:45,932 --> 00:46:47,959
All right, then.

597
00:46:47,959 --> 00:46:51,300
It was so delightful to have
everyone get together like this.

598
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,084
But I'm tired now, so...

599
00:46:53,084 --> 00:46:55,209
can you walk me to my room, Soo Jin?

600
00:46:55,209 --> 00:46:56,296
Yes.

601
00:46:58,291 --> 00:47:00,785
Please enjoy yourself to your
heart's content before you go.

602
00:47:00,785 --> 00:47:01,965
All right.

603
00:47:01,965 --> 00:47:03,784
I'm going to be listening
while I'm sleeping.

604
00:47:03,784 --> 00:47:06,983
Make sure you laugh loudly
and have a great time.

605
00:47:10,164 --> 00:47:11,802
Bye, now.

606
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:37,722
I have no idea...

607
00:47:41,617 --> 00:47:44,802
how to tell you
something like this, but...

608
00:47:47,544 --> 00:47:50,086
Go ahead.
I'll listen.

609
00:48:01,026 --> 00:48:03,510
I'm sorry that I...

610
00:48:06,867 --> 00:48:08,356
kept running away.

611
00:48:11,858 --> 00:48:16,066
You were always there, which was why
I could run away with peace of mind.

612
00:48:19,894 --> 00:48:21,802
Why didn't I know that?

613
00:48:24,104 --> 00:48:28,015
Please forget all about
the despicable things...

614
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,488
that I said or did.

615
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:36,729
There are so many things
that I want to do for you.

616
00:48:37,215 --> 00:48:38,910
I'll do everything for you.

617
00:48:40,238 --> 00:48:42,521
You don't have to do anything.

618
00:48:43,441 --> 00:48:45,026
I'll do everything for you.

619
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,729
So, please...

620
00:48:54,383 --> 00:48:55,644
for just a bit longer...

621
00:48:55,644 --> 00:48:57,084
Soo Jin.

622
00:48:58,289 --> 00:49:00,800
I've packed all of my things.

623
00:49:03,749 --> 00:49:05,461
All of the things...

624
00:49:07,575 --> 00:49:08,907
that I did with you.

625
00:49:10,861 --> 00:49:13,180
I haven't left out a single moment.

626
00:49:14,845 --> 00:49:16,972
I'll take all of those memories with me.

627
00:49:18,834 --> 00:49:20,682
Because they're too precious to me.

628
00:49:22,898 --> 00:49:24,988
I'm ready.

629
00:49:25,617 --> 00:49:27,140
So let me go now.

630
00:49:30,166 --> 00:49:32,492
It was a pretty decent life.

631
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:35,253
I have no regrets.

632
00:49:38,343 --> 00:49:40,160
Except for just one thing.

633
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,441
Yoon Bok.

634
00:49:48,481 --> 00:49:51,501
The fact that I said mean things
to Yoon Bok, and made her leave.

635
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:03,305
I shouldn't have done that.

636
00:50:03,789 --> 00:50:05,284
After all, when it comes to that child

637
00:50:05,284 --> 00:50:07,934
the one who is having the
hardest time right now is you.

638
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,635
<i>Samhwa Barber Shop.</i>

639
00:50:27,108 --> 00:50:29,602
<i>After walking past the playground</i>

640
00:50:29,602 --> 00:50:32,269
<i>and Moa Mart...</i>

641
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,231
Who is it?

642
00:50:45,512 --> 00:50:47,001
<i>Mom!</i>

643
00:50:53,662 --> 00:50:54,965
<i>Mom!</i>

644
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:10,981
Mom!

645
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:12,704
Yoon Bok!

646
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,769
How did you get here?

647
00:51:17,769 --> 00:51:19,901
Um, I got a map.

648
00:51:19,901 --> 00:51:23,077
I got to Mooryung Station
by looking at a map.

649
00:51:23,077 --> 00:51:26,691
And then, after taking a train
to Cheongmyeong Station...

650
00:51:26,691 --> 00:51:28,302
- By yourself?
- Yes.

651
00:51:28,302 --> 00:51:30,686
I even bought myself hot chocolate
from a vending machine.

652
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:34,206
You can't go around
alone like that!

653
00:51:34,206 --> 00:51:36,026
What if something
terrible happened to you?

654
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:37,751
It's too dangerous!

655
00:51:38,213 --> 00:51:39,249
Mom.

656
00:51:39,249 --> 00:51:41,669
Didn't you miss me?

657
00:51:43,796 --> 00:51:47,137
I missed you so much, Mom, that...

658
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,128
Of course I missed you!

659
00:51:51,128 --> 00:51:53,590
Why would you think that
I didn't miss you?

660
00:52:04,693 --> 00:52:06,477
- Yoon Bok!
- Yoon Bok!

661
00:52:16,358 --> 00:52:18,575
You took the train by yourself?

662
00:52:18,575 --> 00:52:19,606
Yeah.

663
00:52:20,019 --> 00:52:21,720
Weren't you scared?

664
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:22,977
Nope.

665
00:52:22,977 --> 00:52:24,838
You really are amazing.

666
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:30,001
So kids find a way to their moms
no matter what, huh?

667
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:34,044
<i>I apologize.</i>

668
00:52:35,099 --> 00:52:37,762
I'll let her sleep here for tonight,
and bring her back tomorrow.

669
00:52:39,296 --> 00:52:40,385
Yes.

670
00:52:40,865 --> 00:52:42,787
You can call this number.

671
00:52:44,499 --> 00:52:45,972
I apologize.

672
00:52:52,405 --> 00:52:54,191
This is delicious, Aunt!

673
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:57,090
Eat as much as you want, but slowly!

674
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,204
All right.

675
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:08,061
You're going to send her back tomorrow?

676
00:53:10,189 --> 00:53:13,218
That tiny child came all this way.

677
00:53:13,218 --> 00:53:14,990
But she has to go back
after just one day?

678
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:17,448
Can't we wait a few more days
before we send her back?

679
00:53:19,249 --> 00:53:20,970
I'm already scared...

680
00:53:22,146 --> 00:53:24,508
about not being able to let her go.

681
00:53:37,503 --> 00:53:39,441
Starting next week

682
00:53:39,441 --> 00:53:41,910
I'm going to go live in a group home.

683
00:53:43,874 --> 00:53:46,229
"Happy Child Group Home."

684
00:53:46,684 --> 00:53:49,059
I'll have three older siblings

685
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,160
and two younger siblings.

686
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,291
And I'll be right in the middle.

687
00:53:58,001 --> 00:54:00,084
So you're going to be living
in a group home, huh?

688
00:54:01,285 --> 00:54:03,443
It's nice that you're
right in the middle.

689
00:54:04,488 --> 00:54:06,061
But...

690
00:54:06,615 --> 00:54:10,318
I have to call the person there "Mom."

691
00:54:13,706 --> 00:54:17,356
Do you think...
that I'll be able to do that?

692
00:54:23,148 --> 00:54:24,434
Yeah.

693
00:54:26,499 --> 00:54:28,302
You'll be able to do it.

694
00:54:28,713 --> 00:54:30,845
Try doing it slowly, bit by bit.

695
00:54:32,778 --> 00:54:34,798
That's how we were at the beginning, too.

696
00:54:35,291 --> 00:54:39,666
Then, will you not be
my mom anymore, Mom?

697
00:54:42,635 --> 00:54:45,215
There are a lot of kids
who have several moms.

698
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,414
And I'm one of them.

699
00:54:49,671 --> 00:54:53,108
Granny Finger, Sister Clara...

700
00:54:53,751 --> 00:54:55,191
and your grandma, here.

701
00:54:57,983 --> 00:54:59,686
They're all my moms.

702
00:55:00,912 --> 00:55:03,090
Then, does that mean...

703
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:06,827
that you could have another kid, too?

704
00:55:14,289 --> 00:55:16,151
I don't know, Yoon Bok.

705
00:55:16,872 --> 00:55:20,209
I really have no idea
how to answer that question.

706
00:55:23,213 --> 00:55:28,436
If you're asking me if I'll love
another child instead of you...

707
00:55:29,213 --> 00:55:30,927
then that's a definite no.

708
00:55:31,907 --> 00:55:34,059
People who truly love each other...

709
00:55:34,584 --> 00:55:36,651
can never be truly separated.

710
00:55:40,224 --> 00:55:43,461
Didn't it feel like I was by your side

711
00:55:43,461 --> 00:55:45,434
even when I wasn't?

712
00:55:46,099 --> 00:55:47,298
Yes.

713
00:55:47,298 --> 00:55:49,452
When I was eating curry...

714
00:55:49,956 --> 00:55:51,780
when I was reading books...

715
00:55:52,336 --> 00:55:54,439
before I fell asleep...

716
00:55:54,439 --> 00:55:57,731
and when I saw birds flying in the sky.

717
00:56:00,934 --> 00:56:02,561
And...

718
00:56:03,055 --> 00:56:04,423
always.

719
00:56:07,211 --> 00:56:09,111
It was the same for me.

720
00:56:10,539 --> 00:56:12,686
Whenever I ate fried pork chops.

721
00:56:12,686 --> 00:56:14,660
When I opened my eyes in the morning.

722
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:16,881
When I saw a train passing by.

723
00:56:16,881 --> 00:56:19,392
Always.
Always.

724
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:21,898
But, Mom...

725
00:56:23,706 --> 00:56:25,189
That's...

726
00:56:25,189 --> 00:56:28,311
not truly being together.

727
00:56:30,613 --> 00:56:31,807
That's...

728
00:56:32,979 --> 00:56:35,244
just a lie.

729
00:56:41,055 --> 00:56:42,689
You're right, Yoon Bok.

730
00:56:44,727 --> 00:56:46,758
It is a lie, but...

731
00:56:48,666 --> 00:56:50,930
but we're good at lying.

732
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:55,220
Just like how you think of
the things you like...

733
00:56:56,535 --> 00:56:58,731
I'll think of you.

734
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:01,863
So I'll be able to keep
myself from crying...

735
00:57:03,126 --> 00:57:04,845
even when I want to cry.

736
00:57:05,474 --> 00:57:06,881
And, before long...

737
00:57:08,972 --> 00:57:11,160
Do you still have Mommy's key?

738
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:22,934
One day...

739
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:28,184
we'll meet again.

740
00:57:30,412 --> 00:57:33,557
Just like how Mommy and
Granny Finger met again.

741
00:58:42,573 --> 00:58:44,195
Grandma?

742
00:58:53,015 --> 00:58:54,410
Yoon Bok?

743
00:58:54,796 --> 00:58:56,662
Are you all right?

744
00:58:59,952 --> 00:59:01,611
Is that really you, Yoon Bok?

745
00:59:01,611 --> 00:59:02,747
Yes.

746
00:59:03,892 --> 00:59:05,818
Am I already dead?

747
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:08,916
You're not a ghost, right?

748
00:59:10,019 --> 00:59:11,791
I'm not a ghost.

749
00:59:11,791 --> 00:59:13,499
I took the train here.

750
00:59:15,999 --> 00:59:17,227
I see.

751
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:20,874
Want me to get Mom?

752
00:59:20,874 --> 00:59:22,037
No.

753
00:59:24,474 --> 00:59:25,934
Let's just have it be the two of us.

754
00:59:54,729 --> 00:59:55,990
Yoon Bok.

755
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:00,006
Can you stay with me for a while?

756
01:00:00,869 --> 01:00:03,108
I'm so cold and lonely tonight.

757
01:00:04,003 --> 01:00:05,818
Want me to hug you?

758
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:30,939
To be honest, I wanted to be alone.

759
01:00:32,749 --> 01:00:34,597
Because I had a lot to do.

760
01:00:34,597 --> 01:00:37,374
What kinds of things do you need to do?

761
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,325
Say farewell.

762
01:00:43,334 --> 01:00:44,671
I've...

763
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:47,240
lived so many lives...

764
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:50,465
so there are many people
that I need to say farewell to.

765
01:00:50,465 --> 01:00:53,338
And who are you saying farewell to today?

766
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:59,001
Emily, from "Our Town."

767
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:08,055
I've been involved in theater
since I was nine years old.

768
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:10,823
That's the same age as me.

769
01:01:10,823 --> 01:01:12,010
That's right.

770
01:01:13,084 --> 01:01:15,285
At that age...

771
01:01:16,177 --> 01:01:18,729
I already knew what I wanted to do.

772
01:01:20,001 --> 01:01:22,155
Dancing and singing.

773
01:01:22,965 --> 01:01:24,814
And making everyone...

774
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:26,816
look at me.

775
01:01:28,769 --> 01:01:31,012
Doing that was so fun.

776
01:01:31,718 --> 01:01:32,919
But...

777
01:01:33,831 --> 01:01:36,135
when I turned 19...

778
01:01:37,164 --> 01:01:39,213
standing on a stage...

779
01:01:39,872 --> 01:01:41,423
suddenly became so scary for me.

780
01:01:42,439 --> 01:01:44,231
It was so cold...

781
01:01:44,231 --> 01:01:45,334
and scary...

782
01:01:45,782 --> 01:01:47,329
and it left me feeling suffocated.

783
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:49,320
I felt as if I would faint.

784
01:01:51,573 --> 01:01:54,684
It hadn't been long since
my mother passed away.

785
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:57,881
It was my first performance
without my mother.

786
01:02:03,593 --> 01:02:05,789
I was playing the role of Emily.

787
01:02:06,309 --> 01:02:09,340
A young mother, who leaves
behind a four-year-old child...

788
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:11,173
and dies.

789
01:02:12,809 --> 01:02:14,702
Emily dies...

790
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:16,916
and goes to the afterlife.

791
01:02:17,836 --> 01:02:20,503
There, she runs into her
dead mother-in-law.

792
01:02:21,434 --> 01:02:22,740
"Mother-in-Law."

793
01:02:23,854 --> 01:02:25,802
"We can go back..."

794
01:02:26,193 --> 01:02:28,032
"to that world."

795
01:02:28,486 --> 01:02:29,758
"I feel it."

796
01:02:30,309 --> 01:02:31,729
"I know it."

797
01:02:32,934 --> 01:02:35,267
"I returned to the farm
for a brief moment."

798
01:02:36,184 --> 01:02:37,845
"And, just as I did in the old days..."

799
01:02:38,363 --> 01:02:42,258
"I sat the child on my lap,
as if I were still alive!"

800
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:43,622
And at that moment...

801
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:47,981
I felt that my mother...

802
01:02:47,981 --> 01:02:49,198
was by my side.

803
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:53,977
That my dead mother...

804
01:02:55,454 --> 01:02:57,084
occasionally came...

805
01:02:57,858 --> 01:02:59,843
and visited my home.

806
01:03:01,885 --> 01:03:05,224
I suddenly understood
the feelings of a mother...

807
01:03:07,021 --> 01:03:09,260
who died and left her child behind.

808
01:03:14,343 --> 01:03:16,519
After that day...

809
01:03:16,519 --> 01:03:18,320
I've never once...

810
01:03:18,885 --> 01:03:22,291
felt scared, like I did on that day.

811
01:03:23,061 --> 01:03:24,441
But, tonight...

812
01:03:25,048 --> 01:03:27,153
I felt just as I did back then.

813
01:03:27,671 --> 01:03:28,856
Cold...

814
01:03:29,727 --> 01:03:31,794
lonely, and out of breath.

815
01:03:32,981 --> 01:03:36,184
I'll hold your hand, Grandma.

816
01:03:44,026 --> 01:03:47,521
I want to become an actress, too.

817
01:03:49,019 --> 01:03:50,269
Really?

818
01:03:50,269 --> 01:03:54,144
I feel like it'd be so fun
to become someone else.

819
01:03:54,613 --> 01:03:57,550
And you're so cold, Grandma.

820
01:03:58,164 --> 01:03:59,403
Yoon Bok.

821
01:04:00,747 --> 01:04:02,157
Over there...

822
01:04:02,704 --> 01:04:03,977

823
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:06,872

833
01:04:58,914 --> 01:05:01,015
Are you sleepy, Grandma?

834
01:05:01,015 --> 01:05:02,108
Yeah.

835
01:05:02,738 --> 01:05:04,706
I want to give you something.

836
01:05:04,706 --> 01:05:07,570
I'll go to Mom's room
and bring it for you.

837
01:05:08,994 --> 01:05:11,684
It's something that you really need.

838

she was 8 to 10 years old.
