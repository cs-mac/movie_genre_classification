1
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,438
<i>This was my body.</i>

2
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,790
<i>On December 27, 1979,</i>
<i>I lay in bed all day.</i>

3
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,870
<i>Whether I was asleep or in a coma</i>
<i>later became a subject of dispute.</i>

4
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,469
<i>When my breathing</i>
<i>became obstructed...</i>

5
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,669
Maria!

6
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,872
<i>... my husband, Claus von Bulow,</i>

7
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,993
<i>finally did as my maid</i>
<i>had been urging all day:</i>

8
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,031
<i>he summoned a physician.</i>

9
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,149
Dr. Paultees?

10
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,876
<i>I stopped breathing.</i>
<i>My heart stopped beating.</i>

11
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,356
<i>By this time,</i>
<i>I was certainly in a deep coma</i>

12
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,836
<i>from which I awoke several hours later.</i>

13
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,111
<i>By the next morning,</i>
<i>I was myself again.</i>

14
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,519
There's no reason for all this fuss.
I never felt better in my whole life.

15
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,757
<i>This first coma aroused</i>
<i>suspicion and fear</i>

16
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,952
<i>in the minds of my personal maid Maria,</i>

17
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,834
<i>my son Alex,</i>
<i>and my elder daughter Ala.</i>

18
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,272
<i>From this time on, though they never</i>
<i>voiced their suspicions to me,</i>

19
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,075
<i>they kept a vigilant eye on Claus.</i>

20
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:53,389
<i>A year later, just before Christmas,</i>
<i>their darkest fears seemed justified.</i>

21
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,071
- Has Mummy had breakfast yet?
- No, we haven't seen her.

22
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,999
<i>My husband did not want our daughter</i>
<i>Cosima to see what he had found,</i>

23
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,839
<i>so he motioned to his stepson Alex.</i>

24
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,349
<i>Second coma. My pulse was 38,</i>

25
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,155
<i>my temperature 81.6 degrees.</i>

26
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,709
Did you call an ambulance?

27
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,913
Nicholas, ask Robert to open the main
gates. We're expecting an ambulance.

28
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,396
Send an ambulance immediately...

29
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,035
Keep her in something warm.
A blanket or anything you can find.

30
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,232
<i>All this activity was pointless.</i>

31
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,074
We'd better do an EEG.

32
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,557
<i>I never woke from this coma,</i>
<i>and I never will.</i>

33
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,839
<i>I am what doctors call</i>
<i>"persistent vegetative", a vegetable.</i>

34
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,194
<i>According to medical experts, I could</i>
<i>stay like this for a very long time,</i>

35
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,596
<i>brain-dead, body better than ever.</i>

36
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,878
<i>Enter Robert Brillhoffer,</i>
<i>former Manhattan district attorney.</i>

37
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,471
<i>My two children from my first marriage,</i>
<i>Alex and Ala von Auersberg,</i>

38
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,479
<i>hired Brillhoffer to investigate the case.</i>

39
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,717
He put a "do not resuscitate" order
on her hospital chart.

40
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,752
<i>They sent Alex</i>
<i>and a private investigator</i>

41
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,318
<i>back to my Newport cottage,</i>
<i>Clarendon Court, to search for drugs.</i>

42
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,798
<i>They found plenty... in Claus's closet.</i>

43
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,559
<i>On top of that, the hospital lab reported</i>

44
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,629
<i>that my blood insulin on admission</i>
<i>was 14 times normal,</i>

45
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,958
<i>a level almost surely caused by injection.</i>

46
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,039
<i>Insulin injection could</i>
<i>readily cause coma...</i>

47
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,676
<i>or death.</i>

48
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,639
<i>This encrusted needle</i>
<i>tested positive for insulin.</i>

49
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,278
<i>Alex couldn't wait to get back</i>
<i>and show Brillhoffer.</i>

50
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,629
<i>Now they felt they had</i>
<i>the murder weapon.</i>

51
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,910
<i>All they lacked was the motive.</i>

52
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,036
<i>At that moment, my husband</i>
<i>was vacationing with his mistress,</i>

53
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,790
<i>the very beautiful soap-opera actress,</i>
<i>Alexandra Isles.</i>

54
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,875
Oh, God!

55
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,950
<i>Mrs. Isles, a divorcée, was the daughter</i>
<i>of an old friend, Count Billy Botsky.</i>

56
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,352
<i>Brillhoffer also discovered</i>
<i>that, at my death,</i>

57
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,439
<i>Claus, whose own net worth</i>
<i>was only a million dollars,</i>

58
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,235
<i>stood to inherit 14 million from me.</i>

59
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,879
<i>Alexandra later testified that Claus</i>
<i>showed her a legal analysis of my will.</i>

60
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,229
<i>On the evidence collected by Alex,</i>
<i>Ala and their lawyer Brillhoffer,</i>

61
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,673
<i>my husband was accused of twice trying</i>
<i>to murder me with injections of insulin.</i>

62
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,238
<i>On March 16, 1982, he was</i>
<i>found guilty on both counts.</i>

63
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,397
<i>...</i> committed
on December 27, 1979...

64
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,513
<i>Even Alexandra Isles</i>
<i>testified against him.</i>

65
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,675
Guilty.

66
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,271
As to count two, charged the defendant
committed on December 21, 1980,

67
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,595
a crime of assault with intent to murder.

68
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,312
- How do you find?
- Guilty.

69
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,433
<i>You are about to see how</i>
<i>Claus von Bulow sought to reverse</i>

70
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,597
<i>or escape from that jury's verdict.</i>

71
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,756
<i>You tell me.</i>

72
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,639
And two! Here it comes. Here we go,
taking you downtown! And Dersh...

73
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,595
Take it in! Foul! OK, here I go.

74
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,314
Watch the hands! Watch the hands!

75
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,235
Yeah, hello.

76
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,316
What?

77
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,595
Oh, shit... Bottom line.

78
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,555
Aw, shit!

79
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,632
Hi.

80
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,551
Let's try that again.
Hi, Dad. Remember Maggie?

81
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,790
Hi, Maggie.

82
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,150
They're gonna fry. The Johnson brothers.

83
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,477
What? But...

84
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,308
Two black kids broke
their father out of prison.

85
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,398
The father shot two people:
the sons are convicted of murder.

86
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,670
A lawyer prays for an innocent client.

87
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,156
Finally, I get two.
Both of them are gonna get zapped.

88
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,794
- No more appeals?
- This was the best shot.

89
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,116
Whoa. It's the press.

90
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,549
<i>You</i> don't want to talk to the press?

91
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,957
Dershowitz Psychiatric Institute.

92
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,432
Hang on a second.

93
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,074
Claus von Bulow.

94
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,670
- It's a reporter.
- With an English accent?

95
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,314
What paper do you represent?

96
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,113
If I can't save two innocent kids,
what's the point?

97
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,151
Yeah, one second. Sorry.

98
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,396
He really seems to think he's von Bulow.

99
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,513
Hello. This is Alan Dershowitz.
Who are you? What do you want?

100
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,597
- It <i>is</i> von Bulow.
- Back in business.

101
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,992
- Can I help you?
- Claus von Bulow?

102
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,156
Elevators to the left.

103
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,996
Holy shit.

104
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,156
Hello?

105
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,436
Hello?

106
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,189
Professor Dershowitz. Hello, hello.

107
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,596
- How good of you to come.
- Pleasure.

108
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,711
Won't you sit down?

109
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,040
- Do you play?
- That? No.

110
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,593
Most people think it's a game of luck.
Actually, it's largely a matter of nerve.

111
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,635
Erm... Nothing, thank you, Charles.

112
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,949
Why don't we go to Delmonico's
and have a proper lunch?

113
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,638
Whatever.

114
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,430
I have the greatest respect

115
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,519
for the intelligence and integrity
of the Jewish people.

116
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,629
When I married Sunny, she was
the most beautiful divorcée in the world,

117
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,512
and one of the wealthiest.

118
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,791
Even so, we never got <i>this</i> table.

119
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,911
Professor Dershowitz.

120
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,635
Dr. von Bulow.

121
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,593
Two injections of insulin,
already I'm a doctor.

122
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,951
In America, it's fame rather than class.

123
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:04,552
Now, after all this unpleasantness,
I always get the best table.

124
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,631
- Speaking of the unpleasantness...
- Oh, yes. We'd better discuss your fee.

125
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,389
OK. $300 an hour.

126
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,710
Good Lord.

127
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,515
You know, I used to be a lawyer
in London. That sounds a bit steep.

128
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,599
It's average for a case like this.
Besides, I do a lot of pro bono work.

129
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,871
You'd pay for that. Plus,
I have to pay students, associates.

130
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,074
Are you saying that if I agree to pay 300,
you will handle my appeal?

131
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,556
No, not so far.
Doesn't look like my kind of case.

132
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:43,112
I'm not a hired gun. I gotta feel a moral
or constitutional issue is at stake.

133
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,834
But I'm absolutely innocent.

134
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,635
And my civil liberties have
been egregiously violated.

135
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,675
Two black kids are facing the electric
chair for a crime they did not commit.

136
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,756
<i>They</i> are innocent.

137
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,113
Well, before you assume I'm guilty,
won't you hear my story?

138
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,314
No. Never let defendants explain. Puts
most of them in an awkward position.

139
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,034
- How do you mean?
- Lying.

140
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,274
But I give you my word as a gentleman.

141
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,748
Oh. Well...

142
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:27,551
Won't you at least read the record
and see if you can find something...

143
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,356
constitutional?

144
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,750
You do have one thing in your favor.

145
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,070
Everybody hates you.

146
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,071
Well, that's a start.

147
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,397
Come on, Maxwell.
Yeah! Come on, Max.

148
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,715
It was a hit! Yes!

149
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,514
- So, what do you think?
- Oh, he did it. He did it.

150
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,758
- Of course he did it. Can we win?
- A hundred to one against.

151
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,793
The maid schmeared him on both comas.
Look at this. It says here...

152
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:11,198
After you realized that Mrs. von Bulow
had not gotten up, what did you do?

153
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,550
I came downstairs,

154
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,468
and Mr. von Bulow said that
Madame had a very sore throat,

155
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,549
<i>and I didn't have to do any work,</i>
<i>and she was in bed all day.</i>

156
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,913
What are you doing? Did we ring for you?

157
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,910
She's ice-cold.

158
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,235
Madame. Mrs. von Bulow!

159
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:55,356
Leave her alone. She's sleeping. She
drank last night. We didn't get any rest.

160
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,270
She's not sleeping. She's unconscious.

161
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,312
- You must call a doctor.
- Maria!

162
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,195
Go on.

163
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,313
<i> A half-hour later,</i>
<i>she had not moved.</i>

164
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,079
<i>I went back and forth all morning.</i>

165
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,828
<i>Finally, mid-afternoon,</i>
<i>Mr. von Bulow spoke to Dr. Paultees.</i>

166
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,235
<i>But he lied to doctor.</i>

167
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,512
She's sleeping now, but earlier she was
up to the bathroom and had a soft drink,

168
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,710
so there's no cause for alarm...

169
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,515
<i> But she never moved.</i>
<i>Never got up.</i>

170
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,758
<i>She was lying</i>
<i>in the same position all day.</i>

171
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:51,034
<i>Later her heart stops, and</i>
<i>Dr. Paultees, he comes and saves her.</i>

172
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,072
<i>After they go to the hospital,</i>
<i>I change the sheets.</i>

173
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,760
<i>I find a puddle of urine.</i>

174
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,078
<i>If Madame went to the bathroom,</i>
<i>she would not have peed in her bed.</i>

175
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,998
Right.
Why would Claus lie about that?

176
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,477
It's suspicious but hardly criminal.
How about the second coma?

177
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,912
Maria wasn't in Newport for that one.
But shortly before the second coma...

178
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,749
<i> I'm cleaning up their room</i>
<i>when I find Mr. von Bulow's canvas bag</i>

179
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,677
<i>packed for Newport.</i>

180
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,031
<i>Inside, there's a little black bag.</i>

181
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,596
<i>A bottle of insulin,</i>
<i>a syringe and needles.</i>

182
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,393
Alexander! Alexander, come here!

183
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:37,989
Insulin? For what, insulin?
My lady's not diabetic.

184
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,238
<i> Three weeks later,</i>
<i>Sunny's lying unconscious</i>

185
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,955
in a freezing bathroom with
her nightgown hiked over her waist.

186
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,753
If I was on that jury,
I would've voted to convict.

187
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,440
Then you're taking the case?

188
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,869
Reminds me of my Hitler dream.

189
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,310
Hitler calls up, he's alive, needs a lawyer.

190
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,716
I say "Sure. Come on over."

191
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,991
Then I have to decide:
do I take the case or do I kill him?

192
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,076
You? No question.

193
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,317
- I would take the case.
<i>- Then</i> kill him.

194
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,630
I'm a maniac. I need your judgment,

195
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,514
someone to watch what I'm doing and
occasionally remind me about the law.

196
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,119
When can I see the transcripts?

197
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,074
You're a former prosecutor, conservative.
We agree on nothing.

198
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,079
But you're smarter than the DA. If I can
beat your arguments, I can destroy his.

199
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,797
Rhode Island is corrupt. Everything is
political. I don't think that way. You do.

200
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,276
I have to see the big picture.
I can't immerse myself in facts.

201
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,311
But we must know the facts.

202
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,433
No one can assimilate information
as quickly as you two.

203
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,596
I agree with that assessment.

204
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,119
- You're out of your mind.
- I only have 45 days to file.

205
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,196
I can't do it without you.

206
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,468
- I know you don't wanna come back...
- Is this strictly professional?

207
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,315
It better be.

208
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,796
That's wonderful. I want the best
people in the world on our side,

209
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,638
the most prestigious experts.

210
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,673
Nobel prize-winning scientists,
some of your colleagues at Harvard.

211
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,190
Wait a minute, Claus.
We got a little problem, OK?

212
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,356
People like that, we can't control.

213
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,358
They find one incriminating fact,
they'll tell the world.

214
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,597
I'm not afraid, Alan.
Let the chips fall where they may.

215
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,030
That's what an innocent man would say.

216
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,513
I know.

217
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,751
That just came for you, Daddy.

218
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,918
My daughter Cosima.
She never doubted me.

219
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:53,990
She loves Alex and Ala dearly. Siding
with me has cost her their affections.

220
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,839
I don't know what I would've done.

221
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,230
I don't want to hear your story,
but I do need some information.

222
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,555
Of course.

223
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:13,071
I gather the older children deny Sunny
had a problem with pills and alcohol.

224
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,792
Spectacular understatement.

225
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,071
So there must be somebody
who saw it. A witness, a friend?

226
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,599
- You want affidavits?
- Yes.

227
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,472
- I'll get them.
- You'll get them.

228
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,797
The drugs prescribed for <i>me</i>
were taken by Sunny.

229
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,273
That's a lot of drugs.

230
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,518
But the prosecution's allegation that
I knew about syringes, injections -

231
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,551
totally accurate.

232
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:37,071
Sunny and I gave ourselves B12 injections
in the late '60s. It was quite the fad.

233
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,830
Can I explain something? The less I know
from you, the more options I have.

234
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,511
When you tell me "the truth", you limit me
to a defense that fits with what you say.

235
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,791
But isn't the truth the simplest way, Alan?

236
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:55,199
I mean, why did I stay all day
at Sunny's side without calling a doctor?

237
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,993
Because Sunny detested doctors.

238
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,237
If we called one without her approval,
she went berserk.

239
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,557
Once she broke her hip and
didn't go to hospital for two days.

240
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,434
- Did you hear what I just said?
- Did you hear the judge sentence me?

241
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,518
Sorry. 30 years is a pretty stiff sentence.

242
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,553
Twice trying to murder one's wife,
anything less would be monstrous.

243
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:20,595
But for a man like myself,
who did nothing...

244
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,474
What I wanted to ask:
if we lose the appeal,

245
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:33,709
will I have the chance later to set my
affairs in order before I'm incarcerated?

246
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,790
In Europe, a gentleman is given
the opportunity to end things properly.

247
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:46,759
- Come on, Claus.
- We are each the keeper of our own soul.

248
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:54,269
Two big problems:
the case against him is very strong,

249
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,269
and the legal conviction isn't the only
conviction that we've got to reverse.

250
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,870
The more dangerous conviction
is the absolute certainty

251
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,719
of the American people
that Claus is guilty.

252
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,355
Finding grounds for reversal
won't be enough here.

253
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,516
Judges on the Rhode Island
Supreme Court

254
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,792
will have to go home to their spouses
and explain why they reversed.

255
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:22,234
To get them to do that, we have to
obliterate every aspect of the state's case.

256
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,954
Destroy the medical case
and their witnesses,

257
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:29,198
so the judges have
no possible way to affirm.

258
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,993
Total victory,
or we are dead in the water.

259
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,671
Now, I assume that you've all had
an opportunity to look at the transcripts.

260
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,438
First impressions?

261
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,475
I think this whole thing stinks.
I think Claus von Bulow stinks.

262
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,797
He's obviously guilty of
something pretty despicable,

263
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:52,711
and, if we free him, we become partners
in his crime, accessories after the fact.

264
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,150
I'm shocked, with your record
defending the poor and oppressed,

265
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,953
that you've taken this case.

266
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,957
I won't have anything to do with it.

267
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,039
And I hope my fellow students
won't, either. Goodbye.

268
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,237
My I exercise my First Amendment
right to free speech?

269
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:20,916
If lawyers only defended the innocent,
there'd be just ten lawyers in the country.

270
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,679
Why help guilty people get off?

271
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,036
You're sure he's guilty? 100% sure?

272
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,711
He had a lawyer. He had a trial.
He was convicted.

273
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,593
- Are you sure he had a fair trial?
- Come on!

274
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,792
It's the basis of the whole legal system!

275
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,276
Everyone gets a defense.

276
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:47,316
So the system is there for the one
innocent person who was falsely accused.

277
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,230
OK, look. Say it's you. OK?

278
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:58,196
You decide to get a divorce.
You're gonna divorce your husband.

279
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,915
A week later, you're accused
of molesting your son.

280
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,470
Don't give me that look.
Stuff like this happens all the time.

281
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,070
Suddenly, you're alone. You hate it.

282
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:15,638
It's a nightmare.
Everyone assumes that you are guilty.

283
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,639
Even the mailman is beginning
to look at you a little funny.

284
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,433
You only got one person
who believes in you.

285
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:26,599
There's only one person
you can trust: your lawyer.

286
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,871
Yeah, OK. So, someone's
gotta defend Claus.

287
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,195
But why you? Why us?

288
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,874
Look, you're my student.
You have a choice.

289
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,675
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to. That is your choice.

290
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,554
The reason <i>I</i> take cases - and here
I'm unlike most other lawyers,

291
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,433
who are not professors
and have to make a living -

292
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,439
I take cases cos I get pissed off.

293
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,949
And I am pissed off here.

294
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:00,438
The family hired a private prosecutor.
Unacceptable!

295
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,632
They conducted a private search!

296
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,038
Now, we let 'em get away with that, rich
people won't go to the cops any more.

297
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:13,109
You know what they'll do? Get
their own lawyers to collect evidence.

298
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,516
And then they are going
to choose which evidence

299
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,995
they feel like passing on to the DA.

300
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,510
And the next victim isn't
gonna be rich like von Bulow,

301
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:29,352
but is gonna be some poor schnook who
can't afford or can't find a decent lawyer.

302
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:39,710
I think it's a little more complicated
than your simple moral superiority.

303
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,999
No?

304
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,193
I agree von Bulow is guilty, but that's
the fun. I mean, that's the challenge.

305
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,993
See? Now, <i>there</i> is a lawyer.

306
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,834
- What?
<i>- I have Mr. von Bulow for you.</i>

307
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,076
OK, put him on.

308
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:01,035
Alan, a rather unsavory character
called David Marriott contacted me,

309
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:05,392
claiming to have information about
a drug delivery at Clarendon Court.

310
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,114
- OK. Where does he live?
- Somewhere in Wakefield.

311
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,196
OK, we'll get on it.

312
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,708
Tom, I want you to get
a private investigator

313
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,515
to dig into a David Marriott,
lives in Wakefield.

314
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:23,348
- OK. How are we gonna win this case?
- The judge made lots of mistakes.

315
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,074
Judges always make mistakes.
How will we win?

316
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,668
One issue leaps up.
This lawyer, Brillhoffer,

317
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,873
interviewed Alex, Maria, everybody.
He was the first to hear their stories.

318
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,151
He took notes and used them at trial
against a defense witness.

319
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,955
But the defense never saw the notes.
The judge wouldn't let us have them.

320
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,310
It's perfect <i>Brady.</i>

321
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,796
OK, why don't you draft a letter,
writing to Brillhoffer,

322
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,354
asking him very nicely
to send us his notes?

323
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,632
- Yeah, right. He'll fax them right over.
- Yeah, right.

324
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,796
We could win on this issue alone.

325
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,356
You know it, I know it.
Just make sure <i>he</i> knows it.

326
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,392
- Now, Nancy and Dobbs.
- Yes?

327
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,557
They're going to attack
the medical testimony.

328
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,752
Our Rhode Island counsel,
Peter Macintosh,

329
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,348
he will analyze the state supreme court.

330
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,076
The rest of us should begin dissecting
the transcript. Errors, inconsistencies.

331
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,957
OK, great. Now remember, most cases
are won in the field, not in court.

332
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,636
Minnie?

333
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,989
You wanna work with Sarah on this?

334
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,715
- You may learn something.
- Come on, Minnie.

335
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,193
Minnie!

336
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,357
- Please?
- Come on.

337
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,392
I don't trust Marriott. I don't know him.
But if he knew Alex von Auersberg...

338
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,035
You're crazy. I don't know who
you think you are. Perry Mason?

339
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,551
Let our private investigator interview him.
It's stupid and unprofessional.

340
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,478
- It's fun.
- Fun? This guy is a sleaze.

341
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,593
- You don't know what he's gonna try.
- What, is he gonna shoot me?

342
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,676
Come on, I'm from Brooklyn.

343
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,949
OK, I'll stand by the window every ten
minutes. That way you can know I'm safe.

344
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,918
I had this friend, Gilbert Jackson.
Interior decorator.

345
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,873
Flaming queen,
but a very excellent guy.

346
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,428
He introduced me to Alex von Auersberg.

347
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,197
Sure it was Alex?

348
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:30,713
We had dinner a few times, drinks.
All I knew, Alex was some rich kid.

349
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:36,236
So sometimes - this is like summer of '77-

350
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,794
I'd motor to Newport for some R and R.

351
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,275
Gilbert asked me to bring Alex a package.

352
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:46,159
I figured interior decoration.
Maybe drapes.

353
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,748
Like six times. So I'd call Alex.

354
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,952
- How did you get his phone number?
- From Gilbert.

355
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,514
- You still have it?
- Maybe.

356
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,550
I'm that kind of guy.

357
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,116
Here.

358
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:33,199
One night, I got curious.
Opened the package.

359
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,200
Fuckin' pharmacy, man.
Needles, syringes, white powder,

360
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:43,598
nice selection of pills, Demerol...
Like a drugstore.

361
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,519
You delivered drugs six times
and didn't know it?

362
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,954
Stupid, huh?
Then Gilbert asked me again.

363
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:00,237
I couldn't say no, but this time I made
Alex open the package in front of me.

364
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,316
Voilà.

365
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,477
I go "Awful lot of pharmaceuticals
for one person."

366
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,434
He goes "Oh, I give some
to my mom to keep her off my back."

367
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,709
A few weeks later,
Gilbert gets mistaken for a softball.

368
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,550
Two guys bash his head in.
Alex calls me, totally urinary.

369
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:25,356
Will the cops find his phone number
and fuck up his trust fund or something?

370
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:31,032
Well, that's the fat. That's the skinny.
You like it?

371
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,674
You traffic with drug dealers
and drag queens,

372
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,678
you have a part-time job,
you ride in rented limos.

373
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:43,476
All in all, I'd say you're probably the least
impressive witness I've ever seen.

374
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,068
Wait a minute.

375
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,671
You think I'm scum, don't you?

376
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,076
Blow it out your ass.

377
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,829
You want a witness to back me up?
I'll get one.

378
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,919
And hey, maybe I'll see you
at the Celtics, huh?

379
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,635
I am not going to let them execute you.
You're not gonna die.

380
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,356
Look, Johnny, this is gonna be
a lot easier on you if you don't cry, OK?

381
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,677
I... I know your brother's hysterical.

382
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,553
Number one, they always
set a date for the execution,

383
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,671
and they always postpone it.

384
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:36,113
He's great like this. I just wish he had
something left for those around him.

385
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,800
Why are you talking to me about money?

386
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,559
Anyway, it's nice to have you back here.

387
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,396
Say hello to your brother.

388
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,750
Right. OK.

389
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,069
OK, who's got what?

390
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,755
Maria's testimony. She says Sunny
did take Valium prescribed for Claus.

391
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,598
Score one for von Bulow.

392
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,871
- And this Jamie Smather prescription?
- Who's Jamie Smather?

393
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,074
300-pound red-headed hooker in white
boots. She supplied Claus with Valium.

394
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,794
He had a gorgeous mistress
and went to an ugly whore?

395
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,878
There are some things
even mistresses won't do.

396
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,268
- Like what?
- I am not telling.

397
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,396
Anyway, Maria swears she first saw
this Jamie Smather prescription

398
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:34,195
February 14th,
and then again February 28th.

399
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,153
- So?
- It wasn't prescribed till the 28th.

400
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,714
You're not suggesting she's lying?

401
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,559
How about Maria's insulin?
Anything more on that?

402
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,636
Not yet.

403
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,353
Something about that bothers me.

404
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:53,552
- OK, who's next?
- Brillhoffer wrote back.

405
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,716
He's very attached to his notes.

406
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,752
"I am satisfied that there is not
a scrap of paper in my files

407
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,872
that might even arguably
be viewed as exculpatory."

408
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,596
- Translation?
- He says he has nothing that'd help us.

409
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,230
- You with me?
- Pay dirt.

410
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,237
- What?
- He's a lawyer.

411
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,158
If he didn't have anything,
he'd give it to us.

412
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,477
But there's something there,
and he'll fight to hold on to it.

413
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,309
I will bet my fee that no one
remembered seeing insulin

414
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,476
until after the lab report came back.

415
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,592
- So you're suggesting...
- Memory enhancement.

416
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,792
- It might be more than that.
- Possibly.

417
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,150
- A frame-up.
- You mean, by the kids?

418
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,829
- Where d'you get this? Brillhoffer's letter?
- Pure deduction.

419
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,954
A good lawyer is part psychiatrist,
detective, logician.

420
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,039
- A great lawyer...
- Never would have taken this case.

421
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:56,832
If there's nothing more...
Has anybody read this?

422
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,155
It's an interview with Truman Capote.

423
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:05,115
He says, when she was 19, Sunny von
Bulow taught him how to inject drugs.

424
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,514
Let me see that.

425
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:14,991
- Well, well, well. The famous professor.
- My new girlfriend, Andrea Reynolds.

426
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,271
- I'm not his girlfriend. I'm his savior.
- Perfectly true.

427
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:23,315
Two days after the trial, we fell in love.
It was really very dramatic.

428
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,396
Andrea, Andrea, Andrea, come on.

429
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,197
Since then, I've devoted my life
to clearing his name.

430
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,959
I made him hire you.

431
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,355
"Get the Jew," I said.

432
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,991
Darling...

433
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,873
Can the Jew get down to business?

434
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,231
We've got an affidavit. Smythe.

435
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:49,718
Mrs. Ruth Smythe gave us an affidavit
corroborating Truman Capote.

436
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,910
I have affidavits, too.

437
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,717
Newport people.
They describe Sunny taking pills,

438
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,796
getting drunk and falling down,

439
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,310
thumping into doorways,
smearing lipstick all over her face.

440
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,352
- Not a very pretty picture.
- She did it, didn't she?

441
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,436
Don't be a priss.

442
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,313
- Sunny was a lovely woman.
- Spoiled rotten.

443
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,910
Yes, but lovely. Till she drank.

444
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,876
Two drinks, and she became...
nasty, irrational.

445
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,356
All women are irrational.
Did we mention the priest?

446
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:28,430
Oh. Marriott apparently confided
in a priest, who's consented to talk to us.

447
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,709
Father Capello from Providence.

448
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,149
A priest? A priest is the ideal witness.
It's like getting the word of God.

449
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,874
I checked. God is unavailable.

450
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,234
lf... <i>if</i> the priest comes through,

451
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,874
and we can get documentation
on Sunny's drug use,

452
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,150
self-injection may be a plausible theory.

453
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,795
- There's no insulin in this case.
- But people do use insulin.

454
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,310
They use it for dieting.
Sunny was concerned about her weight.

455
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,752
Maybe, but believe me, Alan,
there's no insulin here.

456
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,839
Really? How can you be so sure?

457
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:22,717
You realize, with this case,
I'm looking for evidence to exonerate you.

458
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:27,755
But, at the same time, I'm also
wondering... what really happened.

459
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,429
- Who you are.
- Who would you like me to be?

460
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,269
Your mother's death... What happened?

461
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,673
I believe she had a heart problem.

462
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,189
The rumor in England is you killed her.

463
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,949
Hey, Alan. Statute of limitations
ran out on that years ago.

464
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,753
There's rumors also that I killed my aunt.

465
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,628
And that I'm a necrophiliac
who injected Sunny with insulin

466
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,320
so that I could have my way with her.

467
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,758
Please.

468
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,910
<i> Did Claus drive me crazy?</i>
<i>Even I don't know.</i>

469
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,673
<i>But it's true that I took</i>
<i>up to 24 laxatives daily,</i>

470
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,268
<i>popped aspirin like M&M's,</i>

471
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,233
<i>smoked three packs of cigarettes a day,</i>

472
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,113
<i>had a problem with alcohol,</i>

473
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,470
<i>took Valium and Seconal frequently</i>

474
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,353
<i>and consumed large quantities of sweets,</i>

475
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,711
<i>despite a medical condition,</i>
<i>hypoglycemia,</i>

476
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,956
<i>which made them hazardous.</i>

477
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,873
<i>As for my state of mind...</i>

478
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,639
<i>I had not had sex with</i>
<i>my husband for years.</i>

479
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:56,548
<i>My schedule was: I woke at 9.30,</i>
<i>did a little exercise and shopping,</i>

480
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:01,595
<i>and returned to bed at 3 o'clock</i>
<i>for the remainder of the afternoon.</i>

481
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:07,317
<i>I liked to be in bed.</i>
<i>I didn't much like anything else.</i>

482
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,031
Hold on here, will you?

483
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,510
- Come in.
- Alan.

484
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,677
Welcome to my humble law firm.

485
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,713
In the kitchen,
our insulin-on-the-needle team.

486
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,673
They're cooking up
some surprise for us.

487
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,072
This is our Brillhoffer-notes team.

488
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,758
Mr. von Bulow.

489
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,509
- Where are the paper towels?
- Ask Sarah!

490
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,596
Sarah used to live here.

491
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,275
This... I guess he was up all night.

492
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,637
This sort of commune,
you do it on every case?

493
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:20,630
Never before. 38 days to write
100 pages. Only way to get it done.

494
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:24,594
Here's the black-bag team.
Illegal-search team.

495
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:38,155
My son Elon lost his room. Actually
this is another case that you're paying for.

496
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,275
- And this is <i>my</i> team.
- You wish.

497
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,914
I can't find the damn thing.

498
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:50,670
- Hi. I'm Sarah.
- And a very lovely Sarah you are.

499
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,918
- Does that really work?
- Flattery? Absolutely.

500
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,919
Like Chinese food?

501
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,197
What do you give a wife
who has everything?

502
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,829
An injection of insulin.

503
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:13,956
How... Ah, my prawns.
How can one define a fear of insulin?

504
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,116
Claustrophobia.

505
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:26,238
Is there anything more you can
tell us about Alexandra Isles?

506
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:30,319
Is it true that she gave you a deadline
of Christmas 1979 to be together?

507
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,876
Not really. No, she knew
I was looking for full-time work.

508
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,230
I worked for JP Getty in London.

509
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,989
Alexandra assumed that, when you did
find a job, you'd marry her?

510
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,236
Oh, she assumed it.

511
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,753
Did you sense that she
wanted to get back together?

512
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,713
Very much so.
In fact, at the trial, she said...

513
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:54,356
I loved him, but I was still
caught up in my own anger.

514
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,673
And I'm sorry I acted that way then.
I loved him then. I was angry.

515
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,074
Let me ask you this.
Maybe you can't answer.

516
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,350
Do you still love him?

517
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,475
I don't know.

518
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,398
<i>- That means yes.</i>
<i>- It would seem so.</i>

519
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,911
In fact, after the trial, she wrote me
a letter saying so explicitly.

520
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:21,160
A very passionate letter.
Passionate and jealous.

521
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:25,873
But that was the relationship
from the outset. That was Alexandra.

522
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,117
She was your love slave.

523
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:41,113
Ah. I think now I'll have my own
individual order of ginger prawns.

524
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:48,271
Three weeks before her final coma,
Sunny overdosed on aspirin.

525
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,870
- Can you tell us about that?
- I had nothing to do with that.

526
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,276
Of course not.
I'm asking you what happened.

527
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,630
Sunny had been unwell.

528
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:08,028
- Are you all right?
- Just a bit dizzy.

529
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,150
If you're dizzy, don't go wandering...

530
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,396
Sunny?

531
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,472
Oh, my God. Come on, my darling.

532
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,717
You're all right. Put your arm
around my shoulder.

533
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,913
No, you're all right. Come on,
we'll get you back into bed.

534
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,639
- Something happened to my head.
- You're all right.

535
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,320
It's just a little cut.

536
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,193
Come on, let's get you lying down.

537
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,356
There you are.

538
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,799
There.

539
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,752
- Shall I call a doctor?
- No!

540
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,351
No, I don't want a doctor.
Just... I don't want a doctor.

541
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,675
I just wanna be left alone.

542
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,191
I wanna be left alone
with all those beautiful letters.

543
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:24,279
What did you do with those letters?
Why did you write those letters?

544
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,678
Later the doctor said
we needn't have gone to hospital,

545
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,677
but I wasn't going to take any chances.

546
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,711
Why did she take so much aspirin?

547
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:36,072
Sunny always took aspirin. She'd
been taking a lot for several days.

548
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,317
- That's not what our doctor said.
- Dr. Lucus Lupardus,

549
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,238
chief forensic toxicologist,
Suffolk County,

550
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:46,558
says people who take lots of aspirin
every day never reach that level.

551
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:52,471
He also said the average blood level
in cases of death is 60. Hers was 90. So...

552
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,398
So, it was obviously a suicide attempt.

553
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,556
- Why?
- Yeah. Why?

554
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:02,719
- Why?
- Alan, do they all want to be prosecutors?

555
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,078
We're waiting.

556
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,230
I presume she was unhappy.

557
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,235
How about we all finish up
and go back to the house?

558
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:26,433
We're not gonna win this
on a technicality. Peter?

559
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,599
I've read every recent case where
the Rhode Island Supreme Court reversed.

560
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,190
They don't like to make new law
or discuss broad legal issues.

561
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,039
When they do reverse,
the grounds are technical,

562
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,116
but the reason seems to be

563
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,994
they suspect a convicted
defendant may be innocent.

564
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,429
OK, everybody get that?

565
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:51,351
True or not, we've gotta convince
the judges that you are innocent.

566
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,392
Claus, now I <i>do</i> wanna
hear your side of the story.

567
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:59,435
With pleasure. Innocence
has always been my position.

568
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,074
First coma: what preceded it?

569
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,993
Sunny loved Christmas.

570
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:12,670
<i>It was her favorite season, really.</i>

571
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,792
<i>You see, what you must</i>
<i>understand about Sunny</i>

572
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,992
<i>is that she loved giving</i>
<i>more than anything else.</i>

573
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,394
<i>Each year, she always made</i>
<i>a big bowl of fresh eggnog.</i>

574
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,795
<i>On that year, she drank a lot of it.</i>

575
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:35,311
<i>- How much?</i>
<i>- 10 or 12 glasses.</i>

576
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,592
<i>- With her hypoglycemia?</i>
<i>- Did she always drink like that?</i>

577
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,757
<i>Never. She never touched alcohol at all,</i>

578
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,270
<i>except on social occasions</i>
<i>to overcome her shyness</i>

579
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,039
<i>or when she was upset.</i>

580
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,720
<i> This was not a social occasion?</i>

581
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:57,153
<i>No. We'd been discussing</i>
<i>divorce all afternoon.</i>

582
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:18,512
This whole subject of
your work coming between us,

583
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:23,429
isn't it just a pretext,
when the real subject is <i>her?</i>

584
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,710
Certainly not.

585
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:31,279
I'm thinking of redecorating
this whole fucking house.

586
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:35,877
Then she knew about Alexandra.

587
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,037
- Yes.
- How did she find out?

588
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:42,311
Er... I...

589
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,079
I told her the previous summer.

590
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,440
Oh, I've been meaning to mention...

591
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:23,510
our understanding about my...
extracurricular activities.

592
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,232
Mm?

593
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:30,718
I've been involved with someone who falls
outside the parameters of our agreement.

594
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:34,355
- Really?
- Someone peripherally in our circle.

595
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,839
Billy Botsky's daughter, Alexandra Isles.

596
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,236
Well...

597
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:49,672
That must be better for you than
what you've had to put up with.

598
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,792
You're referring to the call girls.

599
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:58,358
Yes. I mean, that is where
you've gone previously, isn't it?

600
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,190
Yes, it is.

601
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:08,153
And isn't this better? Or is
Billy Botsky's daughter a call girl too?

602
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,796
This is much better.

603
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,358
<i>That was what? July, August?</i>

604
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,473
Now it's Christmastime, and you were
still squabbling over Alexandra?

605
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,795
No, we were fighting about my work.

606
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,876
Sunny was...

607
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:34,437
Well, by the evening,
she'd drunk so much eggnog

608
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,233
<i>that I had to help her into the bedroom.</i>

609
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,036
Time for bed, darling.

610
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,796
There we are.

611
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,714
Please don't hold my arm.

612
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,195
Darling, you know when you get like this.

613
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:03,518
Do you remember?
You fell and broke your hip.

614
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,631
That was years ago.

615
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,954
It was two years ago.

616
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,390
Get me a Scotch and soda.

617
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,279
May I at least urinate alone?

618
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,992
She runs the water every time
she goes in there.

619
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,750
<i>If she was soused, why get the Scotch?</i>

620
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,952
Because she asked for it.

621
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,548
Sunny got what Sunny wanted.

622
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,716
It's OK.

623
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,519
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, darling.

624
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,313
- Good night, Claus.
- Good night, Alex.

625
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:10,836
Hasn't my mother given us
enough money? Claus!

626
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,076
<i> That night, we hardly slept.</i>

627
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,317
Your age is perfectly acceptable to retire.

628
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:20,956
I'm already retired.
I haven't worked full-time since Getty.

629
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:25,119
Exactly. It's your ego.
You've never had a career, not really.

630
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,515
I'm going to have one now.

631
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,758
Come on, Sunny. Your father worked.

632
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:37,394
Do you want the children to think
a male's place is in a deck chair?

633
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,875
You marry me for my money,
then demand to work.

634
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,956
You're the prince of perversion!

635
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:46,915
- Are you trying to destroy our family?
- No, of course not. I simply want some...

636
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,952
...intercourse with the world.

637
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,071
Shut up, Pan!

638
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,430
Oh, what does it matter?

639
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:01,316
So, is that it? Another divorce?

640
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:08,199
OK. I'll divorce you. I will.

641
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,995
Oh, God. Two-time loser.

642
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,911
- I'll divorce everybody.
- I don't want a divorce.

643
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,474
I don't want to marry
Billy Botsky's daughter.

644
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,831
I want to stay with you and I want
to work. I need that as a man.

645
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,836
It's hopeless.

646
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:36,753
Oh, God. I need my beauty sleep.

647
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:41,510
Why do you believe it's hopeless
just because it's some...

648
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,796
Good night, Claus.

649
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,275
Sunny, you know I love you.

650
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,670
Good night.

651
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:51,475
- OK, and the next day?
- Well...

652
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,910
Maria's testimony
was wildly exaggerated.

653
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:03,598
Sunny was never moaning.
Maybe the occasional slur, but...

654
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,514
And Maria shook Sunny.

655
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:12,998
Nobody ever shook Sunny.

656
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,029
What happened when
she became conscious?

657
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:22,118
After the first coma,
it was kind of absurd.

658
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,834
Everybody was angry at <i>me.</i>

659
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,268
Can't you ever leave me alone?

660
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,310
Why did you do it?

661
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,353
I would've been better off.
You would've been better off.

662
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,677
What do you want me to say?
I'm sorry I saved your life?

663
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,756
Yes.

664
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,076
Say it.

665
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,479
Of course I'm not sorry.

666
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,876
Claus.

667
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,230
What am I going to do with myself?

668
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,876
When I phoned Alexandra to tell her,
she said the same thing.

669
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,549
She said "Why did you do it?
Why did you call the doctor?"

670
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,955
Are you saying she wanted you
to let Sunny die?

671
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,514
No, no, no, no, no.

672
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:48,714
It was more "Everybody says
Sunny's such an unhappy woman

673
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:52,150
and has nothing to live for."

674
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:57,516
Well, so much for the first coma.

675
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:01,553
The second, of course,
was much more theatrical.

676
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,069
Theatrical? What is this, a fucking game?

677
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,476
This is life and death.
Your wife is laying in a coma.

678
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:10,717
You don't even make
a pretence at caring, do you?

679
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,796
Of course I care, Alan.

680
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:18,399
It's just I don't wear
my heart on my sleeve.

681
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,076
Let's call it a night, OK?

682
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,513
As you wish.

683
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:30,952
Three drugs on the needle:
amobarbital, Valium, insulin.

684
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:34,713
We can't all be you, Alan.

685
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,911
Get a doctor to prepare five needles.

686
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:49,919
One with nothing, two with
Valium, amobarbital and insulin,

687
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,871
two with just Valium and amobarbital.

688
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,833
We send them to the lab
that our famous needle went to.

689
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,916
See if we get a false-positive result.

690
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,749
- If we don't?
- If we don't, I clean the latrines.

691
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,190
You're not gonna believe this.
David Marriott wants money.

692
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,038
Who doesn't?

693
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,594
- His memory might fail.
- Forget him.

694
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:13,794
He has lost his job, and he is running
around trying to find evidence for us.

695
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,879
Let's do what the government does
with witnesses. Pay him for his time.

696
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,992
- What's his time worth?
- Buck and a half.

697
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,759
Dersh! Your team's on!

698
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,551
- You gonna pass to me this game?
- No.

699
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,555
Their investigator said the needle
had an encrustation near the tip.

700
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:35,638
Doctors tell us this is
inconsistent with injection.

701
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,876
So how did it get there?

702
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:40,315
Oh.

703
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:44,592
If I inject this needle,
the skin acts as a kind of a swab.

704
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:48,998
It cleans the needle off, leaving
the tip completely free of liquid.

705
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:54,114
But if I just dip the needle
into the liquid, what do you see?

706
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:57,357
Dry this out, you have an encrustation.

707
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,833
So it's a frame-up?

708
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,758
It's Desdemona's handkerchief.

709
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:06,715
My stepchildren thought I was guilty,
didn't have evidence, so concocted some.

710
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:11,868
- This should win us the case, no?
- No. We're maybe halfway home.

711
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,230
There's still a lot of weird stuff.

712
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,510
- Did you love Sunny?
- I married her.

713
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:19,796
Of course I loved her. She was beautiful.

714
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,115
- Rich.
- Why not?

715
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,390
What I've seen of the rich,
you can have 'em.

716
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,511
I do.

717
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,195
The black bag. Was it yours?

718
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,316
Sunny appropriated it.

719
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:40,638
But to understand that, you must
understand that, after the first coma,

720
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:43,638
<i>she went into a complete rage.</i>

721
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:50,593
- Did you take them?
- Certainly not. Take what?

722
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:53,280
My pills, you moron!

723
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,630
Valium, Seconal.

724
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,154
- You took them, didn't you?
- I've long since stopped interfering.

725
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,669
Well, who? My children wouldn't dare.

726
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:06,554
- Oh. I know who.
- Where are you going?

727
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,271
Maria!

728
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,636
<i> She soon found them.</i>

729
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:37,197
It's my lovely mother, isn't it?
She's behind all this.

730
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,629
She's in cahoots with Maria.

731
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:46,511
Well, just because she had all the money
before <i>I</i> had all the money

732
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:49,074
does not mean she's my lord and master.

733
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,839
Of course not. <i>I</i> am your lord and master.

734
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,156
Just kidding.

735
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:02,113
Maria loves me too much.

736
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:06,995
It's unhealthy for her,
and it's certainly no fun for me.

737
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,556
There.

738
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:32,032
We'll see if that ugly little maid
of mine can sniff this one out.

739
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,433
And what are you going
to do with all that?

740
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:48,873
I'm not gonna tell <i>you.</i> I assure you,
it's not gonna be among my affairs.

741
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,559
<i> Odd she used that word - "affairs".</i>

742
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:57,229
The prosecution thinks you ground up
the drugs to inject Sunny.

743
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:00,557
And this nose-drop business
is pretty far-fetched.

744
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:03,911
But consider the pattern, Alan.

745
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:07,157
It's public record that Sunny used drugs.

746
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:12,434
Her behavior here of hiding them
in liquid so that no one will find them

747
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:17,236
is your classic alcoholic stashing
pints of whiskey all over the house.

748
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:23,950
You're right. Of course.
You've always been right, haven't you?

749
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:27,680
This is the most dangerous case
I ever worked on.

750
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:32,510
- You find that exhilarating?
- No, I do not. I am breaking every rule.

751
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:35,108
The best way to win
is to proclaim your innocence,

752
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,708
and I have never done that for anybody.

753
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:40,195
And the problem I got is
I see who you are.

754
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,788
- You'd do anything to win.
- So would you.

755
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:45,434
Yeah, but you don't trust the legal system.

756
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:49,917
You're saying I'd manufacture
witnesses, affidavits?

757
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,270
- No, but you would sacrifice me.
- Oh, please, Alan.

758
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:58,393
The more I believe that you are innocent,
then more nervous I am.

759
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:02,957
I go out on a limb for you, you're
proven guilty, I look like an asshole.

760
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:06,436
My reputation, my credibility,
my career - destroyed.

761
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,591
- That's the risk you're taking.
- Well, fuck you.

762
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,676
Fuck you, man!

763
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:26,598
I'm glad we understand one another.

764
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:34,518
<i>It's easy to forget all this</i>
<i>is about me, lying here.</i>

765
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,552
<i>To most of you, my name means "coma".</i>

766
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:41,195
<i>My second marriage means</i>
<i>"attempted murder".</i>

767
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:46,838
<i>Everything before, everything beautiful,</i>
<i>does not exist in the public mind.</i>

768
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:51,556
<i>No one thinks of how I loved</i>
<i>my children. Look at Cosima.</i>

769
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:54,717
<i>And Alex, of course. And Ala.</i>

770
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:57,149
<i>And certainly no one cares about Claus,</i>

771
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:00,033
<i>the way he was when</i>
<i>I fell in love with him.</i>

772
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:03,311
<i>When Claus and I first met,</i>
<i>I was married to the dashing young</i>

773
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:09,117
<i>Prince Alfred Eduard Friederich</i>
<i>Vincenz Martin Maria von Auersberg.</i>

774
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:14,758
<i>It was 1964, seven years</i>
<i>into my first marriage.</i>

775
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:25,035
<i>It seems that my first husband,</i>
<i>Alfie, as he was called,</i>

776
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:29,597
<i>had vowed to be unfaithful</i>
<i>with every pretty girl in Europe.</i>

777
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:34,591
<i>He was having quite a success.</i>

778
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:40,115
<i>And so... I was unfaithful with Claus.</i>

779
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:51,395
Psst.

780
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,909
<i>Wildly unfaithful.</i>

781
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,509
<i>Happy memories.</i>

782
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:14,919
<i>But it's not the passion</i>
<i>I remember most.</i>

783
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:17,235
<i>It's the tenderness.</i>

784
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,475
Good God, what's that?

785
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:27,034
Just one of Frank's pets.

786
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:33,036
Oh, my God.

787
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:48,589
Come on, silly.

788
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:52,110
<i>I never liked people much, not as a rule.</i>

789
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:56,313
<i>But Claus was somehow different.</i>

790
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,749
<i>Not a normal person, I guess.</i>

791
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:08,269
It's all right. Do it again.
Give him some more.

792
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:23,351
<i>One of those things you never forget.</i>

793
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:30,271
<i>Of course, now he lives</i>
<i>in my apartment, my bedroom,</i>

794
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,550
<i>my bed.</i>

795
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:38,550
<i>Cold, isn't it? Cold and brutish,</i>
<i>and the way of the world.</i>

796
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:43,075
<i>Looking at him now,</i>
<i>the issue seems simple.</i>

797
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,156
<i>Is he the devil?</i>

798
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,716
<i>If so, can the devil get justice?</i>

799
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:56,119
<i>And all this legal activity...</i>
<i>is it in Satan's service?</i>

800
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,435
"Sunny von Bulow was totally vulnerable

801
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:01,109
to Claus von Bulow"?

802
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:05,677
- Can't argue with that.
- But it's speculation, exaggeration.

803
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:09,475
- You keep working on it.
- Totally inflammatory!

804
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:13,598
OK, good. Let's go over this.

805
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:17,759
OK, we went over it once.
I just want you to see if it...

806
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:31,119
Oh, shit. What is this? Illegal search?
A technicality, a guilty man's argument.

807
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:35,677
This is different. Usual Fourth Amendment
case, you're trying to exclude evidence.

808
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:37,438
Same thing here.

809
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:41,792
No, this search destroyed evidence!
No fingerprints, no inventory.

810
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,673
What's left hurts Claus,
but the state has to...

811
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,712
The cops tested the drugs
from the illegal search.

812
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,956
- Yes.
- And we are saying that that test

813
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:52,071
constituted a second illegal search.

814
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:56,478
- There are precedents.
- I know there are. I'm not debating that.

815
01:06:56,600 --> 01:07:00,957
- What I'm trying to do...
- You're debating me, personally. Why?

816
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:05,033
I'm debating strategy.
I'm not debating you.

817
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:07,390
We're all on the same team, aren't we?

818
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,511
I don't know. We seem to be.

819
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:12,996
- Then why don't I feel it?
- I thought this was professional.

820
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:15,031
- It was.
- That's bullshit, Alan!

821
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:18,994
I asked you to work on this case
because I think you are a good lawyer.

822
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:24,148
You too, but you give all you have to the
law and forget the people you care about.

823
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:27,078
My clients are the people
that I care about.

824
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,316
- Obviously.
- What I care about,

825
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:33,797
all I fuckin' care about is this!
This case!

826
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:37,708
And making the best possible appeal
that we're capable of doing, OK?

827
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:41,389
You can make your argument better.
You know that! I know that!

828
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,159
So why don't you just do it
and cut all the bullshit?

829
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:48,078
You always have to have
the last word, don't you?

830
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,836
What?

831
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:23,510
We're gonna lose.

832
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:27,189
Why do you think this case
fascinates people?

833
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:32,314
Cos one time or other, every man is
driven crazy by his wife, and in his heart,

834
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:35,716
he wants to do exactly
what Claus is accused of.

835
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:39,719
Kill her in some sly, silent way
that can't be detected.

836
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,796
Claus is a scapegoat.

837
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:46,550
Someone has to suffer for the sin
that we all wanna commit.

838
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,954
Alan, that's ridiculous.

839
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:54,439
It's ridiculous. You're right.

840
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:02,749
- What have you got?
- Prosecution's case is based on a theory.

841
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:07,235
The needle in the bag, insulin
on the needle, insulin in her blood.

842
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:09,351
Right, right, right. OK, fine.

843
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:15,195
In <i>Derek,</i> this Rhode Island
Supreme Court, these same judges,

844
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:20,155
said that, in a case
based on circumstantial theory,

845
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:24,751
the case falls apart
if any part of the theory is weak.

846
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:28,952
If there's a weak link,
then you throw the whole chain out?

847
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:31,036
Exactly.

848
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,878
Peter, that's good. That's very good.

849
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:42,038
- Oh, yeah, this is good.
- Thank you.

850
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:43,718
What do you want me to do now?

851
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:47,389
I want you to find as many
alternative theories as possible.

852
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,557
Hey! Come on.
There's only seven days left.

853
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:57,993
Dersh! You'd better come downstairs.

854
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:02,431
Hey, Dersh. Sorry to get you out of bed.

855
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:06,870
- What do you want? More money?
- Can you get more?

856
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:10,275
Can I have a glass of water, please?

857
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:18,152
No. The reason I'm here...
my affidavit is inaccurate.

858
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:25,391
Great. Just what I need right now.

859
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,795
- It's slow.
- Yeah.

860
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:31,674
I left something out,
something incredibly important.

861
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:35,759
Remember I gave Alex's drugs
to a woman at Clarendon Court?

862
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:36,835
Yeah. So?

863
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,599
That bitch was definitely
Sunny von Bulow.

864
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:46,313
David... this is bad.

865
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:50,319
It looks bad. I've met with you
five times now, and all of a sudden...

866
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:52,556
No, it's not sudden.

867
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:56,878
I think I always knew, but I became
convinced by staring at pictures of her.

868
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:04,158
We can't use your affidavit unless
it's truthful. Are you sure this time?

869
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:08,273
I swear... on the body
and soul of my mother.

870
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,396
Poor woman.

871
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:17,798
Put in this change, and make him
go over every word of the affidavit.

872
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:20,673
Uh... can I use your men's room?

873
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:34,431
<i>- More money?</i>
<i>- Can you get more?</i>

874
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:43,228
If Claus had injected her, he would've
thrown away the needle, right?

875
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:47,239
Sure. If he threw away the insulin,
why keep the needle?

876
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:51,717
- Claus is strange, but he ain't stupid.
- He is arrogant.

877
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,070
- Is that a crime?
- Sometimes.

878
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:58,079
Why are we even discussing this?
It's obvious: the kids framed him.

879
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:00,839
Whoa! You changed your tune.

880
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:08,917
A frame-up doesn't mean he's innocent.
The kids could've framed the guilty man.

881
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:10,996
Dersh! Telephone!

882
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,075
It's Peter Macintosh.

883
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:19,156
Yeah.

884
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,636
Do you know what it is?

885
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,272
OK.

886
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:37,550
Word in Rhode Island is that the state
can't lose. Got an ace up their sleeve.

887
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:39,636
What is it?

888
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,556
He's gonna try to find out.

889
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:47,914
- All right, my friend.
- Friend? I like that.

890
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:49,792
Nothing personal.

891
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:54,118
OK, no students, no witnesses.
Second coma: let's hear it.

892
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:57,232
Strange as it may seem now,
in retrospect...

893
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:01,273
OK, Claus, cut the bullshit.
December 20, 1980.

894
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:08,713
Sunny was unwell.
We'd been arguing all afternoon.

895
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:11,673
<i>I'd been offered a new position</i>
<i>in the oil business,</i>

896
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:15,031
<i>which would've meant</i>
<i>my spending some time in Europe.</i>

897
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:23,271
<i>The discussion must've escalated</i>
<i>because I went to talk to the children.</i>

898
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:29,675
<i>This will bring 50,000 gold florin</i>
<i>from any rebels worth the name.</i>

899
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:33,076
<i>- 50,000 florin?</i>
<i>- That's a pretty good take.</i>

900
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:39,833
<i>- Let's vote on it! All those in favor...</i>
<i>- If you'll forgive my interruption...</i>

901
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:45,632
I... I've something to tell you both.

902
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:48,354
<i>We're heading for</i>
<i>the best pirate days ever.</i>

903
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:50,789
I...

904
01:13:54,440 --> 01:14:00,709
It looks as if... as though Mummy
and I are going to have to split up,

905
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:05,278
because my work is something
she cannot tolerate.

906
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:10,235
Mummy says things like that,
but she always gets over it.

907
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:13,909
Yes, but this has been
going on for too long.

908
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:26,550
I'm going to Europe in the new year.
This will probably lead to a split.

909
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,830
Oh.

910
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,554
It's all right. She'll get over it.

911
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,309
Alex says you said that the next day.

912
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:40,353
Is anything more absurd than announcing
your intention to divorce a woman

913
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:42,436
who's just fallen into a coma?

914
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:47,759
<i>No. That evening everything</i>
<i>seemed normal enough.</i>

915
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:53,238
<i>Not cheerful. But then, we didn't</i>
<i>usually giggle at mealtimes.</i>

916
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:56,113
<i>Despite her doctor's warnings</i>
<i>about sweets,</i>

917
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:59,949
<i>the only thing Sunny consumed</i>
<i>was a sundae.</i>

918
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:15,235
<i>After supper, I went to finish off</i>
<i>some work in my study.</i>

919
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:18,750
<i>The others decided to</i>
<i>chat in the living room.</i>

920
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:24,159
That would be lovely, but first
I need to go to my room for just a minute.

921
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:40,797
<i>After about an hour, I dropped in on them.</i>

922
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:46,834
Darling, would you care for anything?

923
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:50,189
Mm...

924
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:55,155
lf... there's some...
chicken bouillon left.

925
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,076
I'll look.

926
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,995
There you are, darling.

927
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:27,836
Thank you.

928
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,835
How is your work coming?

929
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:41,988
I'm totally flummoxed. I can't
get the figures to make any sense.

930
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:49,469
- Why don't you call your friend Deborah?
- I doubt she'd be in Saturday night.

931
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:56,313
So, Deborah, I think you'll agree
that's 7-2-8. Right. Now...

932
01:16:56,440 --> 01:17:01,070
<i>But Deborah was home,</i>
<i>and we did talk for some time, until...</i>

933
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:04,033
Claus, come quick. Mummy's not well.

934
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:06,958
Deborah, can I call you back
in the morning? Thanks.

935
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:11,039
Her voice got very weak, and she
almost fell down. I had to help her.

936
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,715
Somebody open a window.

937
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,988
I find the chill reassuring.

938
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,752
Now I must speak with Claus.

939
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:36,633
- Good night, Mummy.
- Good night.

940
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,876
Good night, darling.

941
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:45,916
Good night, Alex.

942
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,195
That is, if Claus has <i>time</i> to talk.

943
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:04,432
Or are you going to work every spare
moment right through Christmas?

944
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:09,115
Is your work so fascinating?
Or are you trying to drive me away?

945
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:13,313
Because if you are, you're succeeding,
because I don't want this.

946
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:16,910
I didn't marry you for this.
I could've had anybody.

947
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,110
With my money? Anybody!

948
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:23,470
Well? Say something!

949
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:29,075
Do something! Be a man!

950
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,436
I already have a butler.

951
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:40,269
Do something! I don't want this!

952
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:43,312
I don't! I don't want this!

953
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:46,557
I don't... I don't want this!

954
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:52,231
<i>The same conversation as the previous</i>
<i>year, only this time with greater venom.</i>

955
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:55,989
You've always been afraid of me.
It's not because of my money.

956
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:58,714
It's basically because you're a coward.

957
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:02,913
Your pitiful masculinity is so fragile,
you can't stand confrontation,

958
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:05,315
so you go off with Miss Botsky.

959
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,590
Good night.

960
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:27,196
<i>As was usual,</i>
<i>I was awakened before dawn.</i>

961
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:35,359
<i>I let the dogs out, as was customary.</i>

962
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:44,514
<i>I went back through the bedroom</i>
<i>to my study as quietly as possible.</i>

963
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:51,800
<i>I did not notice if my wife was in bed.</i>

964
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:55,390
<i>I did not notice if the light was on</i>
<i>under the bathroom door.</i>

965
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:58,956
<i>Had it been on, I wouldn't</i>
<i>have given it a thought.</i>

966
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:03,995
<i>I did my exercises, showered,</i>
<i>and then I called Deborah Knowles.</i>

967
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:06,918
Well, I mean, it's stable and it's profitable.

968
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:11,275
<i>Can anyone really believe,</i>
<i>if I was trying to murder my wife,</i>

969
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:16,394
<i>that I would spend an hour</i>
<i>going over a tedious set of figures?</i>

970
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:20,433
<i>After the call, I passed through</i>
<i>the bedroom again. It was freezing.</i>

971
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:23,199
<i>By this time, Sunny</i>
<i>was certainly not in bed.</i>

972
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:26,756
<i>And I heard water</i>
<i>running in the bathroom.</i>

973
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:32,150
<i>I had breakfast, walked the dogs,</i>

974
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:36,592
<i>and, on my return,</i>
<i>asked the children where Mummy was.</i>

975
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:38,950
Has Mummy had breakfast yet?

976
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:41,036
We haven't seen her.

977
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:46,636
Sunny?

978
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:49,835
<i>Her bathroom was</i>
<i>her private sanctuary.</i>

979
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:54,556
<i>No one entered it. Except the maid,</i>
<i>of course, to clean up.</i>

980
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:57,911
<i>Sometimes she stayed there</i>
<i>for hours, or so it seemed.</i>

981
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:01,555
<i>One can only speculate</i>
<i>what goes on behind a closed door.</i>

982
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:03,910
Sunny, are you there?

983
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:07,160
<i>I hesitated even to knock.</i>

984
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:11,276
Darling?

985
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,956
Sunny?

986
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:31,396
Oh, God.

987
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:36,193
<i>Once I'd ascertained she was breathing,</i>
I went to fetch Alexander.

988
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:40,958
- Why not call an ambulance first?
- Panic, Alan, panic.

989
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:43,071
I mean, I...

990
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:46,033
I needed to talk to somebody.

991
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:52,952
I wasn't worried if she was breathing
normally. It wasn't like the year before.

992
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:57,358
In retrospect it seems absurd,
but I looked at her upper lip.

993
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:02,634
She had blood on it. I thought she'd
broken a tooth. That was my concern.

994
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:08,039
And that's really all I can...
that's really all I can say.

995
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:13,073
- But is it the truth?
- Of course.

996
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:17,352
- But not the whole truth.
- I don't know the whole truth.

997
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:21,917
- I don't know what happened to her.
- I wish I didn't believe you.

998
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:26,158
It's very hard to trust someone
you don't understand.

999
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,470
You're a very strange man.

1000
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:32,875
You have no idea.

1001
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:43,670
- Everybody here?
- Macintosh says he's got bad news.

1002
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:48,156
There he is.

1003
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,831
Well?

1004
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:06,272
I found out what the state has.
Their ace in the hole.

1005
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,391
It's you.

1006
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:10,708
It's me?

1007
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:14,515
David Marriott taped
all his conversations with you.

1008
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:16,676
Oh, great.

1009
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:21,271
The scuttlebutt is,
if we win the case, you go to prison.

1010
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,196
What did I say?

1011
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:27,278
Good old corrupt Rhode Island.
A friend got me an excerpt.

1012
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:31,598
<i> The reason I'm here...</i>
<i>My affidavit is inaccurate.</i>

1013
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:35,998
<i>David, this is bad. It looks bad.</i>
<i>What do you want? More money?</i>

1014
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:38,190
<i>Can you get more?</i>

1015
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,231
<i>Yeah.</i>

1016
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:42,954
- That is not what I said.
- It's on tape, Alan.

1017
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:45,469
I don't care. That's not what I said.

1018
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,716
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

1019
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:53,151
I'll tell you what we do. We ignore it.

1020
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:56,272
Alan, with that tape,
it's your whole career.

1021
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,870
I now believe Claus is innocent,

1022
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,993
so we've decided:
no tricks, no technicalities.

1023
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:09,353
We are going to base our appeal directly
and explicitly on Claus's innocence.

1024
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:14,429
- Appeals must be based on judicial error.
- The judge should've thrown out the case.

1025
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:17,836
You can't say there wasn't
sufficient evidence. He was convicted.

1026
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:20,190
- Good point.
- That's what we are saying.

1027
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:22,993
If the rules don't work, you change them.

1028
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:26,829
Red Auerbach changed the jump-ball rule
when the Celtics had a short team.

1029
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:30,509
But it's dangerous politically.
If the judges feel insulted...

1030
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:36,636
Wait. State supreme court shouldn't even
look at an appeal based on new evidence.

1031
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:42,357
Hey, guys. I'll take care of that, OK?
You just leave it to me.

1032
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:47,677
Look, I know you're all exhausted.
We got four days left.

1033
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:51,156
What we do now will decide this thing.
Do you wanna win or not?

1034
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:55,319
- Alan! We've got something.
- We've hit the jackpot.

1035
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:58,238
Our needles that had
amobarbital and Valium...

1036
01:24:58,360 --> 01:24:59,315
But no insulin.

1037
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:03,956
Both came back with
false-positive readings for insulin.

1038
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:06,396
One was 93, the other 282.

1039
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:10,195
We've knocked out every piece
of their medical case.

1040
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:16,479
OK, now all they've got left is my neck.

1041
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:19,273
Anybody know anything
about editing audio tapes?

1042
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:31,476
Defense! Defense! Come on.

1043
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,909
Come on, baby! Come on, baby!

1044
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:44,270
- All right, Alan.
- Come on!

1045
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:48,031
Pass it, Alan.

1046
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,628
Wait a minute. I got it. Where's Raj?

1047
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:52,830
- He's upstairs.
- Where are you going?

1048
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:57,198
Raj. Raj, I got it.

1049
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:59,276
I got it. Remember Maria?

1050
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:01,792
<i>She could have said it like this:</i>

1051
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:06,516
Insulin? For what, insulin?

1052
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:10,355
My lady is not diabetic.

1053
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:13,950
You see? "My lady is not diabetic."

1054
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:17,152
She is assuming that the bag is Sunny's.

1055
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:21,398
Her first reaction, not part of
a legal strategy devised later,

1056
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:24,557
is that the stuff in the black bag
belonged to Sunny, not Claus.

1057
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:28,434
Who'd know better than she?
Start writing.

1058
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:31,597
You are not God! You are a prosecutor!

1059
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:35,713
Alabama can't execute those Johnson
kids before the Supreme Court rules!

1060
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,398
You heard me right.

1061
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:41,195
- You got two hours to make Rhode Island.
- You want me to speed?

1062
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:44,118
No. They'll stop you
and you won't make the deadline.

1063
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:47,755
I'm telling you right now,
those kids fry, you're next!

1064
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:49,279
You're damn right!

1065
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:52,718
<i>Some startling developments</i>
<i>in the von Bulow case.</i>

1066
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:57,755
<i>Professor Alan Dershowitz had been</i>
<i>accused of paying for falsified testimony,</i>

1067
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:01,555
<i>but those accusations were discredited</i>
<i>today by the attorney general,</i>

1068
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:04,399
<i>who announced that</i>
<i>David Marriott's tape was doctored</i>

1069
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:07,239
<i>and that Marriott is not a reliable witness.</i>

1070
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:10,716
So, what was he up to, Alan?
Who was he working for?

1071
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:12,990
Damned if I know.

1072
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,756
Hope they don't think he worked for <i>you.</i>

1073
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:21,873
- No one's going to...
- Look, I don't think you did it, OK?

1074
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,310
But at the Chinese restaurant,
you did duck the big question.

1075
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:28,034
Chuck is our Alexandra Isles expert.

1076
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:34,149
Sunny's aspirin overdose.
Why did she take so many?

1077
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:38,311
What happened? Sunny had a headache?

1078
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:44,154
The headache was Alexandra, right?

1079
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:50,511
Let's hear it, Claus.

1080
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,395
Alexandra was spiteful.

1081
01:27:55,480 --> 01:28:00,395
On the day of Sunny's aspirin overdose,

1082
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:05,753
she returned some presents
I'd given her, some photographs.

1083
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:08,633
Love letters.

1084
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:11,069
She dropped them off in a shopping bag.

1085
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:14,116
Did Sunny see them?

1086
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:17,630
Sunny was home. I was not.

1087
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:22,878
Alexandra neglected
to address the package to me.

1088
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,675
I wanna be left alone with
all those beautiful letters.

1089
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:30,554
What did you do with those letters?
Why did you write those letters?

1090
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:35,789
There's a big difference
between knowing about an affair

1091
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:39,151
and having love letters
crammed down your throat.

1092
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:44,873
It seems that Sunny did care
about your affair. She cared a lot.

1093
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:50,874
Why didn't you tell us?

1094
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,956
Everything was open-book.

1095
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:58,159
"Get the best experts."
"I'm not afraid of the truth."

1096
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:06,193
Looks to me like Alexandra
tried to force Sunny into suicide.

1097
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:10,316
Or they plotted it together.

1098
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:15,109
Either way, he's protecting Alexandra
because he still loves her.

1099
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:17,800
And why not? Hey, she's a babe.

1100
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:22,790
Of course I still love her.

1101
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:26,796
And hate her.

1102
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:32,159
Alexandra, Sunny, Andrea...

1103
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:36,996
I love them all.

1104
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:46,838
<i> Being a human being</i>
<i>is very literal.</i>

1105
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:51,909
<i>You're trapped. Time moves</i>
<i>in only one direction: forward.</i>

1106
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:55,749
<i>It's stupid and boring</i>
<i>and results in a lot of silliness.</i>

1107
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:58,599
<i>Example: the legal process.</i>

1108
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:05,234
<i>In this particular case, a vast amount</i>
<i>of time, effort and money was spent</i>

1109
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:10,309
<i>trying to determine what happened on</i>
<i>those two nights so close to Christmas,</i>

1110
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:15,833
<i>December 26, 1979, December 20, 1980.</i>

1111
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:18,596
<i>Happened right here.</i>

1112
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:26,871
<i>Even now, it all looks the same,</i>
<i>feels the same, smells the same.</i>

1113
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:33,193
<i>If you could just go back in time</i>
<i>and take a peek, you'd know.</i>

1114
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:36,755
<i>And all this would be unnecessary.</i>

1115
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,836
All rise!

1116
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:45,794
Hear ye, hear ye. All persons having
business before the Supreme Court

1117
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:50,869
holding in province within and for the
State of Rhode Island may now draw near.

1118
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,675
<i>Then again, everyone enjoys a circus.</i>

1119
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:58,236
Be seated.

1120
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:03,759
If the appellant is ready,
you may proceed.

1121
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:05,996
Oral argument will be made

1122
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:09,908
by out-of-state counsel,
Professor Alan Dershowitz.

1123
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:23,118
Your Honors, you may not
like Claus von Bulow.

1124
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:28,473
You may think he is guilty of something.
But I am here to tell you he is innocent.

1125
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:30,955
- Our new evidence...
- Professor.

1126
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:35,756
You know there is no case which allows
you to introduce new evidence on appeal.

1127
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:42,069
There is one, Your Honor.
And you wrote it: <i>Derek.</i>

1128
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:45,829
In <i>Derek,</i> you yourself said

1129
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:50,351
that a case based on
circumstantial theory rather than fact

1130
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:54,155
only stands up if no other theory
makes sense.

1131
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:57,750
The only way to show a better theory
is to present it.

1132
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:06,872
Get on with it, counselor.

1133
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,912
The first issue is the encrusted needle.

1134
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:13,518
<i>I hope you will have the courage</i>
<i>to free an innocent man</i>

1135
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:16,074
<i>and remedy a grave injustice.</i>

1136
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:20,159
This will never work.
Too smart for his own good.

1137
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:25,513
Alan says it will work.
If the prosecutor takes the bait.

1138
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:27,995
What do you mean, "bait"?

1139
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:30,554
Argues the evidence.

1140
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:35,310
Your Honors, introduction
of new evidence on appeal

1141
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:40,719
violates every principle of
jurisprudence, every statute,

1142
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:43,434
every precedent, every rule of ethics.

1143
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:45,152
He's nailing us.

1144
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:50,308
I am not going to stand before you
and argue Mr. von Bulow's guilt.

1145
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:57,637
However, I have no choice but to address
Mr. Dershowitz's arguments one by one.

1146
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:02,872
- Bingo.
- First, the encrusted needle.

1147
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:08,152
So, now it's up to the judges.
Tell me what you really think.

1148
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:12,432
I think it's easier to love somebody
than to live with them.

1149
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,310
Love is fantasy. Living is work.

1150
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:20,716
I'll say. And those people
don't like to work.

1151
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:25,311
But if you don't do the work, the love dies,
and nobody wants to deal with that one.

1152
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:27,590
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1153
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:33,590
The love died, Sunny couldn't accept it...
so Claus tried to kill her?

1154
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:35,711
- Maybe.
- I don't agree.

1155
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:40,230
Face it. All we had to do was
prove the state made a lousy case.

1156
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:44,148
We didn't prove Claus was innocent.
We couldn't, and he probably isn't.

1157
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:47,829
- You mean you think?
- So he didn't inject Sunny with insulin.

1158
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:50,428
So what? First coma, no problem.

1159
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:55,839
The attending doctor thought it was
caused by hypoglycemia. All right.

1160
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:59,873
But what about the second coma?
I mean, why does Claus act so guilty?

1161
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,436
Wouldn't any man feel guilty
if his wife was suicidal?

1162
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:08,793
Yeah. So maybe she took the sleeping
pills with the intention of killing herself.

1163
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:12,151
But how did she end up
lying on a marble floor

1164
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:14,953
in a freezing bathroom
with her head under the toilet?

1165
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:17,036
How about this?

1166
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:05,120
<i>Sunny wakes up miserable.</i>

1167
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:13,439
<i>Second marriage is over,</i>
<i>children are leaving home.</i>

1168
01:35:13,560 --> 01:35:15,516
<i>What's to live for?</i>

1169
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:25,711
But when she was found, her nightgown
was hiked over her waist.

1170
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:28,718
Exactly. How did it get there?

1171
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:33,513
<i> OK, let's say she's standing</i>
<i>at the sink. She has to pee.</i>

1172
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:36,871
<i>At exactly the same instant,</i>
<i>the drugs hit,</i>

1173
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,310
<i>her body convulses,</i>
<i>she grabs the nightgown.</i>

1174
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:47,279
- I don't buy that.
- It does seem far-fetched.

1175
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,797
- So is the truth sometimes.
- Bull!

1176
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:55,313
I think she took the drugs the previous
night. Maybe he saw her take them.

1177
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:58,671
<i>Or she told him she was going to</i>
<i>before they fell asleep.</i>

1178
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:10,549
<i>This time, he wants her to succeed.</i>

1179
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:21,596
Sunny?

1180
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:49,952
<i> Maybe there's some way</i>
<i>he can help her along.</i>

1181
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:53,277
<i>Of course. The open window.</i>

1182
01:38:54,160 --> 01:38:56,594
<i>Zero degrees.</i>

1183
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:59,632
<i>But somebody might see her there.</i>

1184
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:04,276
<i>The action of dragging her would</i>
<i>naturally pull up the nightgown.</i>

1185
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:35,436
<i>In this cold, how long</i>
<i>could she survive?</i>

1186
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:57,114
<i>Remember what Sunny said?</i>

1187
01:39:57,240 --> 01:40:01,711
<i>"I would've been better off.</i>
<i>You would've been better off. "</i>

1188
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:08,509
...because the law is a blunt instrument.

1189
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:12,235
It is not a rapier. It is a cudgel.

1190
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:16,353
Tomorrow, death penalty. Which
reminds me of the comedian who said

1191
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:20,871
"Why do they call it the death penalty?
It's no penalty. You're out of the game!"

1192
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:31,550
- Good news.
- And more good news.

1193
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:34,319
- The decision came?
- They just announced it.

1194
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:36,590
- Five-zip.
- We murdered 'em.

1195
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:39,109
- Grounds?
- They got the Brillhoffer notes.

1196
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:41,913
And that guilty-man's argument,
search and seizure.

1197
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:44,235
- Federal or state?
- Both.

1198
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:49,229
If it's federal, they could appeal, but
as it's Rhode Island, they can't. We win.

1199
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:52,033
Don't get too excited till
we see Brillhoffer's notes.

1200
01:40:52,160 --> 01:40:57,234
We destroyed their medical case, but their
witnesses still carry emotional weight.

1201
01:40:57,360 --> 01:41:02,115
Unless the Brillhoffer notes show
that they've changed their stories.

1202
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:04,676
Good afternoon, sir.

1203
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:08,548
- Let me get that for you.
- Thank you.

1204
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:24,514
- You have Brillhoffer's notes?
- Yes.

1205
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:26,596
- Well?
- They're not what we hoped.

1206
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:28,711
I knew it.

1207
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,956
They're much better.

1208
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:37,716
No one mentioned insulin
when they first talked to Brillhoffer.

1209
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:43,153
Plus, Maria told him that, when
she supposedly first saw insulin,

1210
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:47,239
she couldn't even read any of the
labels. They were all scraped off.

1211
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:49,555
- What does this mean?
- It means...

1212
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:52,877
that if there is a second trial,
we can be confident.

1213
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:56,436
Both the medical case and
their witnesses are now highly suspect.

1214
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:58,357
Ah!

1215
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:21,595
Darling, this is Alan Dershowitz.

1216
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:23,438
Yes, I know. Hello.

1217
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:27,235
Alan tells me...
Well, things look very hopeful.

1218
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:32,509
I knew it would come out all right.
Thank you.

1219
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:38,279
Yes, Alan, thank you.
I am eternally grateful.

1220
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:42,359
Hey, this means we'll be getting back
your bail. A million dollars.

1221
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:45,153
I know I still owe you, Alan.

1222
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:48,799
Please send me your bill.

1223
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:54,790
And maybe when you're in New York
we can meet for lunch. I'd enjoy that.

1224
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:00,152
One thing, Claus. Legally,
this was an important victory.

1225
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:02,669
Morally, you're on your own.

1226
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:20,839
<i> Claus von Bulow was given a</i>
<i>second trial and acquitted on both counts.</i>

1227
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:26,350
<i>This is all you can know,</i>
<i>all you can be told.</i>

1228
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:31,997
<i>When you get where I am,</i>
<i>you will know the rest.</i>

1229
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:42,398
Claus von Bulow is still
married to Sunny von Bulow.
He is presently living
and working in London.

1230
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:46,308
The Johnson brothers
remain on death row.

1231
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:51,514
Sunny von Bulow has not spoken
since she fell into her final coma.

1232
01:43:51,640 --> 01:44:03,233
This film is based upon Alan Dershowitz's
book <i>Reversal Of Fortune</i>
and public records.
Dialogue and certain events
and characters contained in the film
were created for
the purpose of dramatization.

1233
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:05,510
Two packs of Vantage, please.

1234
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:17,033
- Anything else?
- Yes, a vial of insulin.

1235
01:44:24,040 --> 01:44:25,996
Just kidding.

1236
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:39,678
