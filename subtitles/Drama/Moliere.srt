1
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,984
<i>After thirteen years
in the provinces</i>

2
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,549
<i>where they grew famous
performing farces,</i>

3
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:29,678
<i>Moliere and his troupe
return to Paris.</i>

4
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,682
<i>By Jove!
Without even going to the notary,</i>

5
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,881
<i>I have a cuckold certificate!</i>

6
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,150
<i>Are you moaning again, drunkard?</i>

7
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,252
<i>Madame Trollop,
I find you with a man</i>

8
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,829
<i>after all the warnings
I've given you</i>

9
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:21,831
<i>and here I am, ridiculed again!</i>

10
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:23,361
Enough!

11
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,201
Not "The Jealous Husband".

12
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,966
Let's play "The Scatterbrain".

13
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:32,273
No! No "Jealous Husband"
and no "Scatterbrain".

14
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:34,611
No more farces.

15
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:36,208
Not here.

16
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,249
Jean-Baptiste...

17
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,187
you're not thinking
of staging a tragedy?

18
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,947
Look around.

19
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,048
We aren't in the provinces.

20
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,295
The royal Court will come here
to see us.

21
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,991
They deserve better than
vulgar farces.

22
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,192
Our company deserves better than
farces!

23
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:01,837
I deserve better than farces.

24
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,643
But you can't play tragedy!

25
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:07,840
- You stutter.
- Your breathing's all off.

26
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,370
You're a terrible tragedian.

27
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:34,738
It's the words.
Corneille's texts are not for me.

28
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,036
I'll write my own plays.

29
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:44,940
I have things to say, Madeleine.
My voice must be heard.

30
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,719
What do you want?

31
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:55,189
The King's brother gave us
this theater to play comedy.

32
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,296
I'll talk to him today.

33
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,331
- And say what?
- That I want to play only tragedies.

34
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,228
He'll have to find another buffoon
to entertain him.

35
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,680
My dear Moliere, stand up straight.

36
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:19,979
Monsieur, thank you for generously
sparing your precious time

37
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,883
to receive a wretched man.

38
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,087
Your Lordship is well?

39
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,785
- Quite, thank you.
- And your spouse?

40
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,227
- Likewise.
- Your children?

41
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,228
- Excellent.
- And His Royal Highness?

42
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:35,528
In perfect health.
His wife and children too.

43
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,195
Tell me, why this visit?

44
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,865
It's about the plays that I...

45
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:43,575
What little diversion
are you preparing for us?

46
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,904
One of those outrageous farces
you do so well?

47
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,941
No, not a farce. Not exactly.

48
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:56,978
A romantic comedy
with endless twists and turns?

49
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,151
My word, not that either.

50
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:02,755
Is it about a shipwreck?
I love tales of shipwrecks.

51
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,256
No shipwrecks, I'm afraid.

52
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:09,925
I thought I'd surprise
your Highness by playing...

53
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,766
Very good, we love surprises.

54
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:15,700
Only please reassure me,
it is a comedy?

55
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:20,976
Naturally, your Highness.

56
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:23,474
Naturally.

57
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,520
What did Monsieur say?

58
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,460
The Devil take Corneille!

59
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:17,461
I'll write better plays than he!

60
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:23,067
I say it, affirm it and proclaim it!

61
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:29,945
I am the greatest author
this country has ever known.

62
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,022
Go on, laugh!

63
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:44,525
The day will come
when my work is so famous

64
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,825
people won't say,
"Speak to me in French"

65
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:51,027
but rather, "Speak to me
in the language of Moliere".

66
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,145
Mr. Moliere?

67
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,615
My mother must see you.

68
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,659
Miss, it's very early
for a courtesy visit.

69
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,264
Whoever your mother is...

70
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,160
Give him some time.

71
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:28,793
He needs to think.

72
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,201
We can't wait forever!

73
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:36,197
Fat Rene is right. If he can't
make a decision, we will.

74
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,017
Rehearsals start tomorrow.

75
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:54,189
It will be a comedy.

76
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,767
<i>Thirteen years earlier...</i>

77
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:13,304
<i>This empire absolute
on land and on sea...</i>

78
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:21,581
<i>This sovereign power
I exercise over the world...</i>

79
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:29,050
<i>This limitless grandeur
and illustrious rank...</i>

80
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:36,262
<i>Which in days gone by cost me</i>

81
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:40,665
<i>such toll and blood...</i>

82
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:46,773
<i>In short, my good fortune
which is so adored</i>

83
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:53,180
<i>by tedious and flattering courtiers</i>

84
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:58,921
<i>is merely the kind of beauty</i>

85
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,153
<i>whose sparkle</i>

86
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,125
<i>blinds.</i>

87

We have the power and authority
to obtain such payment!

103

Ole!

104
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:47,963
A plague on creditors!

105
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:49,692
Long live the theater!

106
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,203
Mr. Poquelin, show indulgence.

107
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,101
142 pounds is all we need!

108
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,909
142 pounds?
He'd earn that in one month here.

109
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,842
He wanted the theater?
Let him suffer.

110
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,709
If you refuse a father's duty,

111
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:05,740
be a good Christian.

112
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:08,645
No!

113
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:42,988
Where are we going?

114
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:03,498
Here they are.

115
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,503
Quick, my dressing gown.

116
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,346
No, I shall not wear it.
Take it off.

117
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,909
Come in.

118
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,791
Mr. Moliere,
what a pleasure to meet you.

119
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,295
My notary, Mr. Bonnefoy,
tells me you're a great actor.

120
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:29,923
He is too kind.

121
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:32,662
I trust him completely,

122
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,868
but in this particular case,
I must judge for myself.

123
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,503
Play something for me.

124
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,442
Excuse me?

125
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:47,043
Go on, play.

126
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,178
Play.

127
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:49,946
Surely you joke.

128
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:52,855
I must judge your abilities
before I hire you.

129
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,485
Hire me?

130
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,629
No one explained?

131
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,293
Very well.

132
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:09,472
First, please realize
that anything said here

133
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:11,838
is under the seal
of absolute secrecy.

134
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,304
For love is at stake.

135
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:20,345
My love for the most beautiful,
vibrant and refined of creatures.

136
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,853
A young widow

137
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:25,618
who receives only the most
enlightened minds

138
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:30,092
and who answers
to the sweet name of Celimene.

139
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,497
Tell us, my dear,
about Count Boisrobert.

140
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,858
Boisrobert?

141
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,568
A man of mystery from head to toe,

142
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:42,503
who's always busy
though he has no business.

143
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,234
Always some secret to tell

144
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:48,143
that merits not the name.

145
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,939
He builds mountains from molehills

146
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,981
and murmurs even his "hellos".

147
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,255
And Madame de Sable,
what about her?

148
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:01,384
Her cook is quite clever,
it is her table one visits.

149
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,859
Do you prefer Madame du Breuil?

150
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,627
The poor woman,
what dry conversation!

151
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,462
Certain men appreciate her.

152
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:14,072
That is true.
But none are ever snared in her net.

153
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:18,706
For beauty without intelligence
is like a hook without bait.

154
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:25,674
Inspired by her spirit
- and to gain her good favor -

155
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:30,513
I wrote a play.

156
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,416
A play?

157
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:35,025
Yes, a short one-act play.

158
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:39,758
I wish to play it for the Marquise
in her salon.

159
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,559
Which is why I need your help.

160
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:44,664
The theater I know

161
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,666
does not lend itself to such whims.

162
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,467
I'm sorry.

163
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:52,109
You're sorry...

164
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,111
Mr. Bonnefoy!

165
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,515
Take him back to prison.

166
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,050
I would've paid your debt but...

167
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:02,075
Good day, sir.

168
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,215
Good day.

169
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,656
What would be the exact terms
of our contract?

170
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:20,629
"Master Moliere agrees
to prepare Master Jourdain

171
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,433
"for a performance

172
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,438
"before the Marquise

173
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:26,406
"to gain her good favor.

174
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:31,606
"For this, Master Moliere
will transmit to Master Jourdain

175
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:36,053
"his complete knowledge
of acting and the stage arts,

176
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:39,580
"and Master Jourdain
will follow his instructions."

177
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,622
I must reach perfection.

178
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:43,787
"Article 3:

179
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:48,629
"The contract shall be considered
fulfilled only if Master Jourdain

180
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,703
"obtains indisputable signs

181
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,262
"of the Marquise's esteem."

182
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:59,166
This means no promises,
I want results.

183
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,905
Final point...

184
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:04,413
"Master Moliere agrees
to keep secret

185
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,213
"the entire undertaking

186
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:10,651
"inside Master Jourdain's home
and out, notably as regards...

187
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,048
"Mrs. Jourdain."

188
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,049
Mrs. Jourdain?

189
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:18,329
Sign here.

190
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:32,942
How will you bring me home
without arousing suspicion?

191
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,758
Take care of our guest's luggage.

192
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,011
A priest?

193
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,319
Has Sir converted?

194
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,849
- Bring me some hot thyme.
- Yes, sir.

195
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,620
- And prepare my bath.
- Yes, sir.

196
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,329
My chest feels tight,
add some honey.

197
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,289
- To the bath?
- No, to the thyme.

198
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:28,456
Yes, sir.

199
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,533
- Your painting teacher's here.
- Since when?

200
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,467
- One hour, sir.
- Let him wait.

201
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:36,506
- Your dance master too.
- Since when?

202
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,601
You summoned them
at the same time.

203
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:41,242
I never know which to start with.

204
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:50,385
The music teacher was here first,
as requested...

205
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,683
Yes. I mean no.

206
00:19:57,763 --> 00:20:00,698
My good man,
what step shall we learn today?

207
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:02,727
Well, I thought...

208
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,592
Practice, no talk! Show us.

209
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:07,268
Your hand, Mr. Jourdain.

210
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:13,000
<i>Temps ilé and two,
and three, and four.</i>

211
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,013
<i>Battement ouvert,</i>

212
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:18,112
<i>rond de jambe and plié.</i>

213
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,139
Your back, sir.

214
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:23,015
<i>Pas de bourrée.</i>

215
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,687
<i>And port de bras...</i>

216
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:26,813
<i>Port de bras.</i>

217
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:34,255
Perfect. It's such a pleasure to
dance! Thank you.

218
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,152
If I dare give some advice...

219
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:01,418
Dare...

220
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,723
You must set the brush
upon the canvas to apply the color.

221
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:08,864
Of course,

222
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:10,757
of course...

223
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,012
There you go.

224
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:22,338
Very good.

225
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,410
Painting is such a pleasure.

226
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:32,651
Perfect.

227
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:35,385
Perfect.

228
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:35,608
Sir?

229
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:37,015
Madame.

230
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:41,024
- Sir?
- Madame.

231
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:44,889
Has there been a death?

232
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,589
A death? Not to my knowledge.

233
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,862
Is the parish in need of funds?

234
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,130
I've no idea.

235
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:57,471
Has anyone indicated
a soul on the path to damnation?

236
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,601
My word, I don't think so.

237
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:04,545
Then could you explain the presence
of a holy man in my home?

238
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,484
A holy man, Madame? Where?

239
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,180
Before me, sir.

240
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,618
Rest assured, I'm only a tutor.

241
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:19,054
For your youngest daughter,

242
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,589
Miss Louison.

243
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,196
Your name, sir?

244
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:35,074
Tartuffe. Mr. Tartuffe.

245
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:36,780
At your service.

246
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:38,739
Well then, Mr...

247
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:40,844
Tartuffe,

248
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:43,343
you must be misinformed.

249
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:46,150
I see no need for a tutor.

250
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:49,749
And certainly not a religious one.

251
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,626
I see one, Madame, yes I do.

252
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,754
Faced with today's declining morals

253
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:57,699
a bit of rigor in this house
would not be superfluous.

254
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:00,702
I'm capable of ensuring
Louison's education.

255
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:02,703
I'm not talking about that,

256
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:06,207
I mean dogma,
the wrath of the heavens,

257
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,906
everything an uneducated mind
tramples underfoot

258
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:11,038
through ignorance.

259
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:14,950
Strange concerns
for a man who never goes to church.

260
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,647
I am master in my own home.

261
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:19,450
Make sure Mr. Tartuffe
is comfortable.

262
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:23,886
And hide your breasts
from our sight.

263
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:45,380
If Sir should need anything,

264
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,851
he should address himself to Sir.

265
00:25:58,657 --> 00:25:59,681
Very well.

266
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:01,988
I see your mother

267
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,822
has taught you some basic notions.

268
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:13,431
But a mind is nothing
without a good soul.

269
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:16,269
Let us start with a prayer.

270
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:23,212
Our Father...

271
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:27,446
Our Father...

272
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,621
Almighty

273
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,628
who rules over Earth and Heaven

274
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:42,198
and the entire Universe...

275
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,394
deliver us from Evil

276
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:48,600
and Sin.

277
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:51,134
Show us the path,

278
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,075
the straight path...

279
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,303
which...

280
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:57,071
which...

281
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:13,962
Madame, perfect timing!

282
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:17,159
I've just learned a new parry,
I'll show you.

283
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:19,428
We must discuss a pressing matter.

284
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:22,062
It'll have to wait.
Here, take a stick.

285
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,333
What should I do with this!

286
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:27,077
- Attack.
- Have pity, my friend.

287
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:28,303
Attack, I said!

288
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:35,015
Have you lost your mind?

289
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:37,315
That's against the rules!

290
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:39,680
How can I dodge a side attack?

291
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,724
I'm not here to play a duel.

292
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,988
I will not suffer Mr. Tartuffe
in my home.

293
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,127
Please leave us alone.

294
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:52,229
You think it's for my pleasure

295
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:55,532
that I shelter and feed this man?

296
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:57,408
Who's forcing you?

297
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,604
Need I explain that these holy men

298
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:03,680
form a powerful secret party?

299
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:07,011
Their influence extends
far beyond the Church

300
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:11,015
and for anyone involved
in certain affairs

301
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,990
it's best they owe you favors.

302
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:14,551
What affairs?

303
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:17,254
No more questions!
For your salvation

304
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,488
as well as our family's,

305
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:22,532
we'd best leave
Mr. Tartuffe in peace.

306
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:52,254
<i>Madeleine, my love,</i>

307
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,365
<i>I don't know
if this will reach you.</i>

308
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:58,059
<i>I find myself a puppet
in a strange adventure.</i>

309
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:00,994
<i>Not a minute passes
that I don't think of you,</i>

310
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:04,198
<i>my sole desire is to see you
and the troupe.</i>

311
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:09,307
Sir requests that Sir
kindly join him in his office.

312
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,852
Here's the text I spoke of.

313
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:18,281
The one I wish to perform

314
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:21,052
for... you know who.

315
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:24,920
I want you to give me
your honest opinion.

316
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:28,760
In this realm I am a sincere man
who cannot tell a lie.

317
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,663
All the better.

318
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:37,070
I don't know whether the style
is clear enough.

319
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:38,231
We shall see.

320
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:41,344
Moreover,
I spent only one hour writing it.

321
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,670
Time has nothing to do with it.

322
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:52,246
It's a dialogue?

323
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:57,354
A love dialogue between Zeus,
all-powerful god of Mount Olympus,

324
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:00,657
and Polyxena,
a young and beautiful princess.

325
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,566
- Who will play Zeus?
- Me.

326
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:06,966
- And Polyxena?
- Myself as well.

327
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,693
What do you think?

328
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:52,010
To a friend,

329
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:56,414
who questioned me one day
about a text he wrote,

330
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:02,554
I replied that gentlemen
should beware

331
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,754
of the itch to write.

332
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:08,163
I was wrong to write it?

333
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,427
I didn't say that.

334
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:12,394
I explained to this friend

335
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:14,364
how...

336
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:19,173
an excess of enthusiasm
sometimes leads

337
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,471
to exaggeration and affectedness.

338
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:24,474
My style is awkward?

339
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:25,777
I didn't say that.

340
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:29,219
But as I tried
to make this friend understand,

341
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:31,449
when it comes to writing

342
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:36,023
simplicity is often your best ally.

343
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:39,388
Very well.

344
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:45,169
Now be honest,
tell me what my text is worth.

345
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:49,070
Frankly, you can throw it
down the toilet.

346
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:52,965
Very well.

347
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:54,404
Go on.

348
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,813
- Excuse me?
- Go on!

349
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:59,510
If you're so brilliant, Mr. Moliere,

350
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:01,811
show us what your quill can do.

351
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:30,872
I was given very little time.

352
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:32,915
Time has nothing to do with it.

353
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:53,025
Well?

354
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:58,832
I am trying, sir,
to sort out my thoughts

355
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:03,113
in order to express my feelings
as clearly as possible.

356
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:07,911
Speaking from reason
rather than passion,

357
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:12,321
if mine's for the toilet,

358
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:17,792
yours does not even deserve
the name of shit.

359
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:24,261
In writing, as in all the arts,
Mother Nature decides.

360
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:27,165
Clearly, you are not
amongst her chosen ones.

361
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:31,200
Let us hope you're
a more talented actor.

362
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,939
I wish you good night.

363
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,306
Sir!

364
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:59,387
Might I know who wrote this text?

365
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,348
Did you read it?

366
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,127
Answer me, who wrote this text?

367
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:06,219
A young playwright.

368
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:08,455
A young playwright?

369
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:11,329
Some boy who dabbles in the theater.

370
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:15,632
He sent me his work
hoping I'd sponsor him.

371
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:19,131
I hope this request
receives a favorable response.

372
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:21,710
You find it of good quality?

373
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:22,870
Of good quality?

374
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:26,611
This text is magnificent.

375
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:31,282
Magnificent.
The style might still lack confidence

376
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:36,022
but the manner in which this man
expresses his sentiments

377
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,392
is so honest, so sincere

378
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,024
that as I read it I felt...

379
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:42,833
I don't know... as if...

380
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:44,698
As if?

381
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:51,541
But you disliked it enough
to toss it on the floor?

382
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:52,802
To tell the truth, Madame,

383
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:55,673
I found it had merit.

384
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:58,247
But Mr. Tartuffe begged me
not to reply

385
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,143
for fear of bringing dishonor
upon our family.

386
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:02,581
Isn't that right?

387
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:06,989
Yes, my word.

388
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:10,685
As I indeed explained
to Mr. Jourdain,

389
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,588
despite the great literary quality
of this text,

390
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:16,465
the theater in itself

391
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:20,531
is condemnable,
for it leads honest souls astray

392
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:25,836
with guilt-ridden pleasures
such as masquerade, lies and duplicity.

393
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:28,868
Just as Christ's body is inside
the consecrated host

394
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:32,779
so the Devil dwells within the body
of the actor who...

395
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,180
- Quiet!
- Thank you.

396
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:37,813
Before you were born
my father took me to see

397
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:41,051
the greatest actors,
who taught me more...

398
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:43,524
Our dear Dorante!

399
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:46,061
You're perfectly right, dear.

400
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:48,358
Let us greet our guest.

401
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:50,560
Dorante is a man of high quality.

402
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:55,195
A companion of the King's
who honors me with his friendship.

403
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:05,377
My friend, how are you?

404
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:07,347
Very well, sir.

405
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:10,045
My goodness, you're so chic.

406
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:12,112
The incarnation of good taste.

407
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:15,157
Madame, beauty and brains in one!
How are you?

408
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:17,294
Holding up, thank you.

409
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:19,251
Sir.

410
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:22,259
I'm only dropping by
- I know you're a busy man -

411
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:25,433
but I wanted to settle my debt.

412
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,800
There's no hurry.

413
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,701
You know the exact amount?

414
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,833
Of course, but there's no hurry.

415
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:33,569
No, I insist.

416
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:36,607
You insist?
Wait, I have my notebook.

417
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:41,181
You embarrass me.
15,800 pounds. No hurry.

418
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,512
15,800 pounds. Very well.

419
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:47,090
Add another 200,
which you'll give me now

420
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:49,615
- that makes 16,000 even -

421
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:52,058
which I will pay you soon.

422
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:57,296
- Is this a problem?
- Not at all.

423
00:38:57,435 --> 00:39:00,233
I could ask others,
but you're my best friend.

424
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:02,271
I didn't want to offend you.

425
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:03,566
Of course, of course.

426
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:06,934
Come into my office
if you don't mind.

427
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:23,617
Tell me, how's our little affair
coming along?

428
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:25,258
Our little affair?

429
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:27,389
What affair?

430
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:29,927
- You know...
- I'm teasing you.

431
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,532
- You're teasing me?
- Of course.

432
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:34,263
It's coming along nicely.
The Marquise...

433
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:39,566
Celimene told me today
that she accepts your gift.

434
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:41,837
I've spent weeks on this.

435
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:42,846
I know, I know.

436
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,746
I impressed the great beauty
of your gift upon her

437
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,374
and she finally gave in.

438
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:52,479
Do you think she would like this?

439
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:03,094
You've chosen the correct path
to her heart.

440
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:06,398
Above all, women adore
when we spend money on them.

441
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:09,429
This gift speaks far more
of your love

442
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:11,507
than any words ever could.

443
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:16,310
Do you think
that one day it will be possible

444
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,543
for me to speak to her in person?

445
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:22,515
Soon, my friend.

446
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:24,618
Maybe even earlier.

447
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:40,326
Is Mr. Jourdain so severe
that his daughter must use cunning?

448
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:42,871
I don't know what you mean.

449
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,909
Her correspondence
with her admirer.

450
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:50,673
Sir, please spare my daughter
her father's wrath.

451
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:52,739
I didn't come to torment you,

452
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:55,283
but to seek peace
and reconciliation.

453
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,712
I know I irritate you,

454
00:40:57,755 --> 00:41:01,122
but I'm the first to suffer
from the image I must portray

455
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:02,892
in order to...

456
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:03,994
How can I put it?

457
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,926
Play the role
with which you were entrusted?

458
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:10,923
You've guessed?

459
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:14,837
Mr. Tartuffe...

460
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:17,838
I understood long ago
that men of the Church

461
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,706
are for the most part mere actors

462
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:23,705
who endlessly repeat the same lines

463
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,473
with more or less conviction.

464
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:31,149
Since I am unmasked,
it's not peace I offer you,

465
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:32,880
but total surrender.

466
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:34,684
As for the young miss,

467
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:38,522
what kind of adult could forget
his own youthful faults?

468
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:43,931
You'd be surprised to discover
the follies I committed from love.

469
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:45,429
You, sir?

470
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,560
My heart is not made of stone.

471
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:49,365
I'm sure of that.

472
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:53,336
It's always your kind
who try to appear so rigid.

473
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:55,902
"Say but the word
and I shall be healed."

474
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:04,853
Tell me about your follies.

475
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:08,723
Did I say follies?
So little to tell, really.

476
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,326
Tell me anyhow.

477
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:14,795
Well there was the time I locked up
my father's coachman

478
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:18,060
and took the carriage
to meet a lady friend.

479
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:20,935
But I didn't know
how to handle the reins

480
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:24,370
and got stuck in a narrow lane
next to the house.

481
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:27,576
And one time
I used my writing quill

482
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:31,679
to engrave a sweetheart's name
in my flesh.

483
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:32,909
- What was her name?
- Agnes.

484
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:35,745
But I was only twelve
and misspelled it.

485
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,548
Mr. Tartuffe,

486
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:40,948
I hardly believe what I hear.

487
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,083
A pious man like you!

488
00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:46,722
I might be devout,
but I'm no less a man.

489
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:50,792
And under your spell,
I confess my reason

490
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:53,636
could falter again.

491
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:58,738
Mr. Tartuffe!

492
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:00,709
Come here!

493
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:02,744
Yes, sir! I'm coming.

494
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,279
I'm coming.

495
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:10,713
Come in, quick!

496
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:13,554
- You need me?
- Yes, to write a note.

497
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:17,550
I fear my writing style
does not please you.

498
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,653
Don't play coy.

499
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:22,356
Dorante is bringing a gift
to my sweet Celimene

500
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:25,227
and I want to add
a well-turned note.

501
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:26,900
To say what?

502
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:31,401
"Fair Marquise, your lovely eyes
make me die of love."

503
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:35,204
Only I wish to say it
more elegantly.

504
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:37,575
You could say that...

505
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:40,449
the flame in her eye
devours your heart.

506
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,280
I don't want that.

507
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,185
I want only the words I used:

508
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:46,948
"Fair Marquise,

509
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:49,425
"your lovely eyes
make me die of love."

510
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:52,825
Only I wanted
a prettier way of putting them.

511
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:02,067
You can leave them as you said...

512
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:04,299
Or else:

513
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:07,740
"Of love, fair Marquise,
your lovely eyes make me die."

514
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:10,711
Or: "Of love, your lovely eyes,
Marquise fair, me make die."

515
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:13,043
"Your lovely eyes, fair Marquise,
die of love; make me."

516
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,845
Or yet: "Make me die of love,
lovely eyes, your fair Marquise."

517
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:23,419
Yes, but which is best?

518
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:25,352
The first one:

519
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:29,132
"Fair Marquise, your lovely eyes
make me die of love."

520
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,362
Incredible!

521
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,730
I got it on the first try.

522
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:39,806
The first try.

523
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,402
Here.

524
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:43,978
I'm ashamed to see a man
of your position

525
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:46,715
lowering himself to such tasks.

526
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:26,355
Easy does it,
one would think you're famished.

527
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,650
Seeing you whets my appetite,

528
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,591
you're pretty enough to eat.

529
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:35,829
A letter for you, Madame.

530
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:38,391
- From whom?
- The Viscount of Chabany.

531
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:39,863
Here.

532
00:45:40,604 --> 00:45:43,505
Read it to me.
I have nothing to hide.

533
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:52,409
"Madame, deprived of your company,
I am literally wasting away.

534
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:55,716
"My ardor is now a raging fire.

535
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,744
"I am yours, as you shall be mine.

536
00:45:57,888 --> 00:46:00,823
"Louis-Jacques de Mesnil,
Viscount of Chabany."

537
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:03,816
How presumptuous! How vulgar!

538
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:05,354
He should be whipped.

539
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,064
I think it shows spirit.

540
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:10,896
Madame, this letter is an insult.

541
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:15,437
Quite, only certain insults
put one's heart in a flutter.

542
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:20,272
Pardon me, Madame,

543
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,604
for not putting your heart
"in a flutter".

544
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,974
Perhaps this will

545
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:31,387
make up for my shortcomings?

546
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:35,682
I admit you surprise me greatly.

547
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,886
And you, Madame,

548
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:41,120
make me suffer greatly.

549
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,126
From what ill, pray tell?

550
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:47,865
I suffer from your pack
of yapping admirers.

551
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,667
You're jealous of everyone.

552
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:53,101
Everyone is so well received here.

553
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:56,972
My word, am I to blame
if people enjoy my company?

554
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:01,277
Must I throw them out with insults
when they pay visits?

555
00:47:01,451 --> 00:47:02,611
Come now, Dorante,

556
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:05,950
a woman's desire to please
comes before all else.

557
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:08,488
A frivolous desire, I admit,

558
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:11,057
but twenty is not an age to behave.

559
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:16,097
You accuse me of jealousy,
yet what do I have

560
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:18,725
that is mine alone?

561
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,333
The joy of knowing

562
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:22,734
that you're loved.

563
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,874
I wasn't bred for love on credit.

564
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:34,047
And I worry about
such shows of generosity.

565
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:36,909
Beware, I'd have no use
for a ruined man.

566
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:39,545
Fear not, Madame,

567
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:42,718
my plans should protect me
from that for years.

568
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:53,496
Forgive me, I feel ridiculous.

569
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,767
Forget ridicule. Doubt's the enemy.

570
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:56,895
Continue.

571
00:47:57,341 --> 00:48:01,869
You're a dewdrop,
hanging from the tip of a leaf.

572
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:05,780
A drop of water that is growing
larger and heavier.

573
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:08,643
Now it quivers...

574
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:10,719
and falls.

575
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:14,714
It falls, Mr. Jourdain!

576
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:20,826
- Good. Another one.
- That's enough for tonight.

577
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,230
The rattle, the flower, the dewdrop.
I'm spent.

578
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:27,230
Exactly! It's when you're exhausted
and can't think anymore

579
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:28,936
that the work begins.

580
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,972
Come on, let's do...

581
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:34,801
The horse.

582
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:36,206
Not the horse.

583
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:39,973
No, no, no, not the horse!

584
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:05,741
What are you doing?

585
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,542
The horse.

586
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:09,338
What horse, please?

587
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:12,344
Are you "all horses" in one?

588
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,508
Don't you know, like we men

589
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:17,615
each horse has its own
unique character.

590
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:20,152
You show me a man playing a horse,

591
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:21,957
not a horse.

592
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:36,465
Are you an Andalusian?

593
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:45,042
Fiery and wild...

594
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:00,926
Or a Selle Français,
haughty and noble?

595
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,876
Are you a robust Percheron?

596
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:34,025
Acting is a profession

597
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,825
of sensitivity, not appearances.

598
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:41,098
Now, please do the horse.

599
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:19,298
Rest assured,
I'll give it to her in person.

600
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:21,504
Yes, sir.

601
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:24,112
Very well, sir. Goodbye.

602
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:32,544
Madame.

603
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:36,453
A young man just delivered
a letter for you.

604
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:37,752
For me?

605
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:48,069
<i>Madame, the compliments with
which you've honored my text</i>

606
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:50,036
<i>only increase the esteem</i>

607
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:52,798
<i>my heart has felt
since I first saw you.</i>

608
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,141
<i>Please grant me a meeting,</i>

609
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:57,404
<i>I shall be the happiest of men.</i>

610
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:00,247
<i>I'll wait in the ruins
at the back of the estate</i>

611
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,248
<i>at sunset.</i>

612
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:09,581
It's...

613
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:12,654
It's a letter...

614
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:15,364
from a gardener.

615
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,328
He's looking for...

616
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:21,164
a job... gardening...

617
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:25,135
in a garden.

618
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:28,371
What was the young man like?

619
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:32,004
My word, a fine figure of a man.

620
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:36,017
Elegant but simple,

621
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:38,544
handsome with regular features.

622
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:41,312
Is that all?

623
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,220
I barely got a glimpse.

624
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:45,822
Yes. Of course.

625
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:47,819
Thank you.

626
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:16,526
Madame...

627
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:18,249
Sir...

628
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:21,264
Madame...

629
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:25,332
I am delighted to meet you.

630
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:27,897
And I, Madame, am overjoyed.

631
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:33,538
Your text aroused in me

632
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:38,673
emotions I thought
forever extinguished.

633
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,684
My audacity was not a sin?

634
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:44,484
To the contrary,

635
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:47,216
your audacity

636
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:49,989
obliged modesty

637
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:53,123
to free the sentiments
it so often smothers.

638
00:53:53,463 --> 00:53:56,125
As I listen to you,
modesty returns,

639
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:57,895
you make me blush...

640
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:01,161
Your mind, sir,

641
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:03,028
shows great sensibility.

642
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:05,201
My mind is nothing,

643
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:07,169
it's my heart which spoke.

644
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:09,138
Your heart?

645
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:12,207
My quill was guided
by your beauty,

646
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,907
without you I could not have
written.

647
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:18,179
Oh Sir,

648
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:22,013
you've touched me

649
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:26,455
deeply.

650
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:27,597
Which is why...

651
00:54:36,673 --> 00:54:37,662
Here.

652
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:39,805
No, Madame.

653
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:41,774
It's to help you.

654
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:44,106
That is not what nourishes me.

655
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,695
Forgive me this disguise,

656
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:38,323
for reasons I cannot reveal,
my identity must remain secret.

657
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:41,498
Sir, I'm...

658
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:43,801
It is I, Madame,
who am overjoyed.

659
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:49,170
Your text
aroused emotions in me...

660
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:53,612
I know. What matter if I sinned?
I listened to my heart.

661
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:56,674
Sir, I came because...

662
00:55:56,853 --> 00:56:00,812
Because my text
touched you deeply, I know...

663
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,757
What do you mean, "I know"?

664
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:04,551
I find you rather smug.

665
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:08,628
What I meant to say
is that your beauty...

666
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:10,927
I will not allow you.

667
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:14,425
As for your text, my words
have surely been distorted.

668
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:19,599
It's not bad, but the sentiments
it conveys are rather naïve.

669
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:24,741
How dare you, sir!

670
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:27,549
I thought
that's what you wanted.

671
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:28,912
What I wanted?

672
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:31,317
What planet are you from?

673
00:56:31,354 --> 00:56:33,345
- I thought...
- You thought wrong.

674
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:39,322
This is for your trouble.

675
00:56:39,357 --> 00:56:40,984
I wish you good luck.

676
00:57:06,251 --> 00:57:09,687
You're burning it?
I thought the author pleased you.

677
00:57:11,089 --> 00:57:15,116
On reflection, I find the style
heavy and pretentious.

678
00:57:18,196 --> 00:57:19,629
I understand.

679
00:57:20,165 --> 00:57:22,531
- No, you don't understand.
- Yes, I do.

680
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:23,997
- No.
- Yes.

681
00:57:24,936 --> 00:57:26,597
Mr. Tartuffe...

682
00:57:26,938 --> 00:57:29,406
what interest is it to you?

683
00:57:29,441 --> 00:57:31,705
It does interest me, Madame.

684
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:34,371
You seem tormented.

685
00:57:34,512 --> 00:57:37,481
I was in peace until you came.

686
00:57:37,649 --> 00:57:40,140
Your presence is my only torment.

687
00:57:43,054 --> 00:57:44,578
Your only torment?

688
00:57:45,223 --> 00:57:46,485
Are you sure?

689
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:53,022
Leave me alone.

690
00:57:53,665 --> 00:57:55,530
- I only wanted...
- Leave me!

691
00:57:57,635 --> 00:57:59,398
What's going on here?

692
00:58:01,439 --> 00:58:02,428
Well, Madame?

693
00:58:04,676 --> 00:58:07,338
I don't want him in our house
any longer.

694
00:58:07,879 --> 00:58:09,813
Ask him to leave, please.

695
00:58:09,948 --> 00:58:12,815
I've already explained...

696
00:58:12,851 --> 00:58:15,046
Mr. Tartuffe is not a holy man.

697
00:58:17,021 --> 00:58:19,888
- What do you mean?
- He's not what he pretends.

698
00:58:21,326 --> 00:58:23,817
What makes you say that?

699
00:58:24,762 --> 00:58:25,854
Yesterday,

700
00:58:27,265 --> 00:58:28,664
in the garden...

701
00:58:30,568 --> 00:58:32,559
he said inappropriate things.

702
00:58:33,137 --> 00:58:34,161
Oh?

703
00:58:35,073 --> 00:58:36,438
What do you mean, "Oh"?

704
00:58:37,208 --> 00:58:39,267
I meant to say, "is that all?"

705
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:41,401
He made advances to me.

706
00:58:41,579 --> 00:58:43,046
Advances?

707
00:58:44,015 --> 00:58:44,982
Are you sure?

708
00:58:45,283 --> 00:58:46,807
Sir, I'm telling you!

709
00:58:46,985 --> 00:58:48,714
You must have misunderstood.

710
00:58:48,953 --> 00:58:50,443
You don't believe me?

711
00:58:50,955 --> 00:58:52,286
Very well.

712
00:58:54,792 --> 00:58:55,781
Very well.

713
00:58:58,496 --> 00:59:00,396
- Hide here.
- This is absurd.

714
00:59:00,498 --> 00:59:01,965
It's like a bad play.

715
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,624
Hide, I said!

716
00:59:03,668 --> 00:59:05,431
And listen carefully.

717
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:07,330
This is ridiculous.

718
00:59:08,373 --> 00:59:09,738
Ridiculous!

719
00:59:14,646 --> 00:59:17,080
I'll have to play along

720
00:59:17,215 --> 00:59:18,807
to trick him
into betraying himself.

721
00:59:20,718 --> 00:59:22,242
But it's you who forces me.

722
00:59:22,554 --> 00:59:24,249
Don't leave me in a predicament.

723
00:59:24,689 --> 00:59:27,214
Stop the game
when your conviction is firm.

724
00:59:30,895 --> 00:59:32,658
Do you hear me?

725
00:59:32,697 --> 00:59:34,324
Yes.

726
00:59:37,602 --> 00:59:41,038
You called me?
Perfect, for I too must explain.

727
00:59:41,105 --> 00:59:44,131
I owe you an apology.

728
00:59:44,342 --> 00:59:45,400
An apology?

729
00:59:45,443 --> 00:59:48,708
I lost my temper with you earlier.
I regret it.

730
00:59:49,113 --> 00:59:51,877
- I alone a.m. responsible.
- No, I am.

731
00:59:52,283 --> 00:59:53,272
I am.

732
00:59:54,018 --> 00:59:56,316
I refused to listen to your words

733
00:59:57,121 --> 01:00:00,887
as well as to my heart.

734
01:00:02,226 --> 01:00:03,420
Your heart, Madame?

735
01:00:03,595 --> 01:00:04,687
Yes.

736
01:00:05,463 --> 01:00:07,363
I am two times guilty.

737
01:00:07,498 --> 01:00:09,227
First I upset you,

738
01:00:09,334 --> 01:00:11,734
then I did not even try
to console you.

739
01:00:18,009 --> 01:00:19,636
Who are you speaking to?

740
01:00:21,546 --> 01:00:23,036
To you, Mr. Tartuffe.

741
01:00:23,381 --> 01:00:25,372
- You're joking.
- You doubt me?

742
01:00:25,883 --> 01:00:28,579
You're always so distant
with him... with me.

743
01:00:28,987 --> 01:00:30,511
Come now, sir...

744
01:00:32,657 --> 01:00:34,420
Do you not know the fair sex?

745
01:00:34,659 --> 01:00:39,289
Certain "no's" are in fact "yes's"

746
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:40,695
that need time to flower.

747
01:00:42,934 --> 01:00:45,402
- I think...
- Think no more.

748
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:47,929
I always think, I can't help it.

749
01:00:48,306 --> 01:00:50,638
Here, thank you for your concern.

750
01:00:53,244 --> 01:00:56,111
As I attempt to explain, I am...

751
01:00:58,583 --> 01:00:59,709
I am...

752
01:01:07,525 --> 01:01:08,753
Well, sir,

753
01:01:09,427 --> 01:01:11,759
since you remain insensitive
to my advances

754
01:01:12,196 --> 01:01:14,096
and my charms have no effect,

755
01:01:14,298 --> 01:01:15,697
return to your prayers.

756
01:01:17,301 --> 01:01:18,495
Good night, sir.

757
01:01:20,538 --> 01:01:21,766
Good night.

758
01:01:40,892 --> 01:01:43,190
What were you trying to prove,
in fact?

759
01:02:09,887 --> 01:02:11,184
Who are you?

760
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:15,726
Jean-Baptiste Poquelin,
aka Moliere, at your service.

761
01:02:17,595 --> 01:02:19,893
- Why are you here?
- To earn my living.

762
01:02:20,298 --> 01:02:22,596
I am an actor.

763
01:02:23,334 --> 01:02:24,392
An actor?

764
01:02:24,435 --> 01:02:25,902
Yes, an actor.

765
01:02:26,204 --> 01:02:29,139
And director
of a bankrupt troupe of players.

766
01:02:31,309 --> 01:02:32,742
Does my husband know?

767
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:35,071
No, I lied to him.

768
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:38,572
He thinks he hired a private tutor,
devout to boot.

769
01:02:41,552 --> 01:02:42,541
Yes.

770
01:02:43,354 --> 01:02:44,981
Dinner is served.

771
01:02:50,695 --> 01:02:52,993
Madame...

772
01:02:53,598 --> 01:02:54,758
Sir.

773
01:03:53,224 --> 01:03:54,919
<i>Madeleine, my friend,</i>

774
01:03:55,159 --> 01:03:57,753
<i>things are more complicated
than expected.</i>

775
01:03:58,229 --> 01:04:01,323
<i>I'm detained by this affair,
which I'll explain later.</i>

776
01:04:01,933 --> 01:04:04,800
<i>I think often of you
and our troupe.</i>

777
01:04:30,228 --> 01:04:31,752
Never say that word, Thomas!

778
01:04:31,896 --> 01:04:34,160
I'll say it, Father, because...

779
01:04:34,465 --> 01:04:36,490
Quiet! I don't want to hear it.

780
01:04:36,634 --> 01:04:38,124
I want to work!

781
01:04:38,436 --> 01:04:39,733
I want to work, Father.

782
01:04:39,871 --> 01:04:42,635
I want to put my education to use,

783
01:04:42,773 --> 01:04:44,638
to earn money in trade.

784
01:04:47,445 --> 01:04:51,404
In this house one does not
earn money, one marries it.

785
01:04:53,484 --> 01:04:54,678
Work...

786
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:56,809
how pathetic!

787
01:05:00,326 --> 01:05:04,057
Serve lunch without me,
I won't be back before afternoon.

788
01:05:19,112 --> 01:05:21,239
Father, Mother,
what perfect timing!

789
01:05:21,347 --> 01:05:22,871
Please meet Mr. Valere,

790
01:05:23,116 --> 01:05:24,674
my singing instructor.

791
01:05:24,817 --> 01:05:26,717
Your humble servant.

792
01:05:27,153 --> 01:05:30,554
You're interested in singing now?
This is news.

793
01:05:30,590 --> 01:05:33,354
No, Father,
it's a very old liking.

794
01:05:34,594 --> 01:05:36,084
Did you know about this?

795
01:05:36,562 --> 01:05:38,496
Yes, in effect.

796
01:05:41,634 --> 01:05:42,623
Well.

797
01:05:43,369 --> 01:05:45,564
- Let's see this lesson.
- Pardon?

798
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:49,140
I wish to watch your lesson
for myself.

799
01:05:56,282 --> 01:06:00,719
<i>Madame, I love you so</i>

800
01:06:00,753 --> 01:06:03,449
<i>Do not resist my passion...</i>

801
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:07,689
<i>My sentiments are the same</i>

802
01:06:08,294 --> 01:06:11,320
<i>Please fear not loving me...</i>

803
01:06:11,631 --> 01:06:14,657
<i>Yet this inflexible father</i>

804
01:06:14,701 --> 01:06:18,762
<i>How to soften such rigor?</i>

805
01:06:18,805 --> 01:06:21,171
<i>Though his fury is frightening</i>

806
01:06:22,475 --> 01:06:24,705
<i>I know the path to his heart...</i>

807
01:06:24,844 --> 01:06:27,779
<i>Madame, I love you</i>

808
01:06:27,914 --> 01:06:29,848
<i>I swear I'll love you forever...</i>

809
01:06:30,049 --> 01:06:33,143
<i>I'll love you the same</i>

810
01:06:33,252 --> 01:06:35,243
<i>To the end of my days...</i>

811
01:06:35,521 --> 01:06:36,783
<i>I love you...</i>

812
01:06:36,923 --> 01:06:38,447
Enough!

813
01:06:40,526 --> 01:06:42,187
No rhythm, no harmony,

814
01:06:42,929 --> 01:06:44,226
and pitiful lyrics.

815
01:06:45,198 --> 01:06:48,190
Daughter, find yourself
a better teacher.

816
01:07:01,614 --> 01:07:02,740
Sir?

817
01:07:03,483 --> 01:07:04,472
Sir.

818
01:07:19,065 --> 01:07:21,124
Excuse me for making you wait.

819
01:07:21,834 --> 01:07:25,235
The count is impatient indeed,
for he has good news.

820
01:07:25,405 --> 01:07:27,669
Good news. Really?

821
01:07:29,142 --> 01:07:30,700
About a meeting, you said.

822
01:07:31,043 --> 01:07:32,943
Yes, a meeting.

823
01:07:33,179 --> 01:07:35,238
- A most anticipated one.
- That's it.

824
01:07:36,849 --> 01:07:39,340
Is it possible? Could it be...

825
01:07:39,519 --> 01:07:40,918
One and the same.

826
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:43,488
No later than tomorrow, you said?

827
01:07:43,790 --> 01:07:45,417
Tomorrow?

828
01:07:45,558 --> 01:07:46,650
Please excuse us.

829
01:07:46,959 --> 01:07:48,620
She liked my diamond?

830
01:07:48,761 --> 01:07:52,458
The word is feeble,
she almost fainted.

831
01:07:52,498 --> 01:07:57,435
She repeated your name all night,
hugging the stone to her breast.

832
01:07:57,804 --> 01:07:59,396
- Show me.
- Excuse me?

833
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:02,535
Show me. Play Celimene
so that I can imagine her.

834
01:08:06,979 --> 01:08:08,241
Well...

835
01:08:11,017 --> 01:08:13,008
She was like this...

836
01:08:24,397 --> 01:08:26,558
I can't do it,

837
01:08:26,599 --> 01:08:30,262
but believe me,
it touched her deeply.

838
01:08:30,303 --> 01:08:32,066
I shall finally speak to her.

839
01:08:32,205 --> 01:08:33,900
You've made me so happy,

840
01:08:34,607 --> 01:08:36,734
so very happy.

841
01:08:51,924 --> 01:08:55,325
Did I tell you my son Thomas
is back from university?

842
01:08:55,795 --> 01:08:58,730
No, you never mentioned
your boy to me.

843
01:08:58,764 --> 01:08:59,753
Boy...

844
01:09:00,166 --> 01:09:01,292
A man already.

845
01:09:02,201 --> 01:09:05,432
The only thing left to confirm it
is a marriage.

846
01:09:07,673 --> 01:09:09,004
If only he could find

847
01:09:09,175 --> 01:09:11,143
a young woman in the region

848
01:09:11,477 --> 01:09:13,741
worthy of the title of Countess.

849
01:09:15,481 --> 01:09:19,076
Countess... a title any father
would wish for his daughter.

850
01:09:21,654 --> 01:09:23,417
What do you insinuate?

851
01:09:23,456 --> 01:09:26,016
You mean,
your daughter and my son?

852
01:09:28,561 --> 01:09:29,550
Interesting.

853
01:09:30,029 --> 01:09:32,759
Audacious but interesting.

854
01:09:32,798 --> 01:09:34,493
Fine then, let's marry them.

855
01:09:34,867 --> 01:09:38,030
And our bonds of friendship
will become family ties.

856
01:09:39,138 --> 01:09:40,298
Game.

857
01:10:06,032 --> 01:10:07,294
It's very strange.

858
01:10:09,101 --> 01:10:11,035
These dogs usually know to avoid

859
01:10:11,203 --> 01:10:12,830
the line of fire.

860
01:10:13,472 --> 01:10:15,133
Let us not speak of it.

861
01:10:16,008 --> 01:10:17,407
In my opinion,

862
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:19,978
his training lacked rigor.

863
01:10:20,079 --> 01:10:22,070
I said, let us not speak of it.

864
01:10:22,281 --> 01:10:24,078
Concerning the marriage...

865
01:10:24,216 --> 01:10:26,150
We'll see about that later.

866
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:27,809
Very well.

867
01:10:29,021 --> 01:10:32,286
<i>Madame, I love you so</i>

868
01:10:33,526 --> 01:10:37,292
<i>Do not resist my passion...</i>

869
01:10:37,930 --> 01:10:42,094
<i>My sentiments are the same</i>

870
01:10:42,234 --> 01:10:45,863
<i>Please fear not loving me...</i>

871
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:50,302
Singing is a condemnable activity

872
01:10:50,443 --> 01:10:52,934
for it leads honest souls astray

873
01:10:53,012 --> 01:10:56,607
with the guilt-ridden pleasures
of happiness and love.

874
01:10:56,749 --> 01:10:58,512
Thank you, Mr. Tartuffe.

875
01:10:58,651 --> 01:11:00,915
We need a bit of rigor around here.

876
01:11:01,053 --> 01:11:03,044
And hide your breasts!

877
01:11:03,489 --> 01:11:04,786
- Lackey!
- Yes, sir.

878
01:11:04,957 --> 01:11:06,322
- No, the other lackey.
- Yes, sir.

879
01:11:06,459 --> 01:11:07,926
- The music teacher's here?
- Yes.

880
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:09,687
- Since when?
- 15 hours ago.

881
01:11:09,829 --> 01:11:12,195
Let him wait.

882
01:11:12,231 --> 01:11:13,391
Our dear Dorante!

883
01:11:13,566 --> 01:11:16,228
A man of high quality,
a friend of the King!

884
01:11:16,369 --> 01:11:19,338
The King, you hear me?

885
01:11:19,372 --> 01:11:22,535
Mr. Jourdain, how chic!

886
01:11:22,675 --> 01:11:25,576
No lie, the incarnation
of good taste!

887
01:11:25,711 --> 01:11:27,804
My dear friend, Dorante.

888
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:29,572
You think so?

889
01:11:33,552 --> 01:11:34,519
Good Jourdain!

890
01:11:34,754 --> 01:11:36,415
What a good Jourdain!

891
01:11:36,589 --> 01:11:37,954
He's so cute, so cute...

892
01:11:53,406 --> 01:11:54,498
Forgive me, Madame,

893
01:11:55,474 --> 01:11:56,964
I got carried away.

894
01:11:59,845 --> 01:12:01,005
You have true talent.

895
01:12:01,347 --> 01:12:02,405
Don't make fun of me.

896
01:12:02,581 --> 01:12:05,345
I'm not. You were born
to make people laugh.

897
01:12:05,851 --> 01:12:08,843
I said I got carried away.
It's a flaw of mine.

898
01:12:09,088 --> 01:12:11,079
I ask you to forget it.

899
01:12:12,124 --> 01:12:13,887
You don't want to play comedies?

900
01:12:16,962 --> 01:12:19,123
Now what have I said
to hurt you?

901
01:12:19,765 --> 01:12:22,962
Acting is a serious art
that deserves respect.

902
01:12:23,002 --> 01:12:23,991
Was I disrespectful?

903
01:12:24,170 --> 01:12:27,298
Yes. You confound
farce and theater.

904
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:31,608
Theater, Madame, is far greater,
nobler and more essential

905
01:12:31,777 --> 01:12:34,245
than what I've shown you here.

906
01:12:37,683 --> 01:12:38,843
Very well.

907
01:12:40,953 --> 01:12:42,147
Show me.

908
01:12:55,468 --> 01:12:58,130
"This empire

909
01:12:59,839 --> 01:13:02,501
"absolute

910
01:13:03,642 --> 01:13:07,009
"on land and on sea...

911
01:13:14,086 --> 01:13:17,886
Very well. Please leave me,
I believe it's late.

912
01:13:17,923 --> 01:13:19,185
Come now!

913
01:13:19,692 --> 01:13:23,651
Is it my fault you bleat
like a goat that's lost its family?

914
01:13:23,829 --> 01:13:28,129
Perhaps tragedy calls for
a sensitivity you do not possess.

915
01:13:28,734 --> 01:13:32,170
Spare me your superior airs.

916
01:13:32,204 --> 01:13:35,640
I know what touches me
and what bores me.

917
01:13:35,674 --> 01:13:38,609
Your pranks are more touching
than any tragedy.

918
01:13:38,911 --> 01:13:41,038
No, Madame. It's impossible.

919
01:13:41,447 --> 01:13:42,914
Impossible?

920
01:13:43,082 --> 01:13:44,208
Why?

921
01:13:45,084 --> 01:13:47,484
Because comedy
- of which you are so fond -

922
01:13:47,653 --> 01:13:49,621
relies on mechanical effects.

923
01:13:49,755 --> 01:13:53,816
Tragedy explores the infinite
complexity of the human soul.

924
01:13:53,859 --> 01:13:55,952
Then play comedies
that explore it.

925
01:13:56,061 --> 01:13:58,894
- They do not exist.
- Then invent them!

926
01:14:05,437 --> 01:14:07,928
You know which evil
gnaws at you?

927
01:14:07,973 --> 01:14:09,304
Pride.

928
01:14:11,343 --> 01:14:12,901
The important thing

929
01:14:13,112 --> 01:14:14,943
is to earn a living with your art.

930
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,775
Practice your profession.

931
01:14:17,216 --> 01:14:18,740
Take to the road,

932
01:14:19,084 --> 01:14:20,244
travel the countryside.

933
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:23,882
Play comedies in every town,
every hamlet!

934
01:14:24,056 --> 01:14:25,546
Make them laugh.

935
01:14:27,359 --> 01:14:29,623
That's how you'll make a name.

936
01:14:30,629 --> 01:14:32,563
The rest will follow in time.

937
01:14:46,846 --> 01:14:48,814
Madame, I...

938
01:15:11,604 --> 01:15:13,265
Come away with me.

939
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:16,264
It's impossible.

940
01:15:16,408 --> 01:15:17,807
Nothing's impossible.

941
01:15:18,043 --> 01:15:20,705
There's only what one wants
and doesn't want.

942
01:15:21,614 --> 01:15:23,639
Then tell yourself I don't want to.

943
01:15:25,651 --> 01:15:27,084
So that's it?

944
01:15:27,519 --> 01:15:28,508
What?

945
01:15:28,787 --> 01:15:32,120
You like to seduce young men,
excite them with your words

946
01:15:32,291 --> 01:15:34,851
and shove them scalding hot
between your thighs?

947
01:15:47,773 --> 01:15:51,800
Remember, your meeting
must appear coincidental.

948
01:15:52,544 --> 01:15:55,342
I'm so impregnated
with its coincidental nature

949
01:15:55,414 --> 01:15:58,110
that I don't even know
it's going to happen.

950
01:15:59,451 --> 01:16:01,442
It's a method I use to prepare.

951
01:16:04,356 --> 01:16:07,382
And don't mention
the presents you've given her.

952
01:16:07,559 --> 01:16:08,651
Notably the diamond.

953
01:16:08,794 --> 01:16:10,091
Why not?

954
01:16:10,696 --> 01:16:12,493
It's so terribly vulgar.

955
01:16:13,132 --> 01:16:16,397
An elegant man pretends
his gifts are insignificant.

956
01:16:16,835 --> 01:16:18,826
Yes, of course.

957
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:22,337
You can count on me.

958
01:16:29,248 --> 01:16:31,375
Look who we have here.

959
01:16:37,356 --> 01:16:38,345
Marquise,

960
01:16:39,191 --> 01:16:41,159
what a pleasure to see you.

961
01:16:41,393 --> 01:16:44,760
Till now, this was a mere garden.

962
01:16:44,797 --> 01:16:46,230
And now what is it?

963
01:16:46,665 --> 01:16:47,654
A showcase, Madame.

964
01:16:51,737 --> 01:16:53,728
Allow me to introduce my friend,

965
01:16:54,039 --> 01:16:55,768
Mr. Jourdain.

966
01:16:59,445 --> 01:17:00,571
Madame.

967
01:17:09,355 --> 01:17:12,290
Madame,
it is a great distinction for me

968
01:17:12,424 --> 01:17:14,984
to have the good fortune
to be so happy

969
01:17:15,127 --> 01:17:18,563
that you've been so good
as to accord me the honor

970
01:17:18,731 --> 01:17:20,358
of honoring me with

971
01:17:20,566 --> 01:17:25,128
the favor of this
coincidental encounter.

972
01:17:25,170 --> 01:17:26,797
The honor is mine, sir.

973
01:17:27,673 --> 01:17:29,971
You've never spoken
of your friend.

974
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:36,013
Some friends are so dear
one would rather not share them.

975
01:17:36,048 --> 01:17:41,452
To seduce this mercenary,
you must have hidden talents.

976
01:17:44,323 --> 01:17:45,881
I see beauty touches you.

977
01:17:48,327 --> 01:17:51,194
You have beautiful hands,
Madame.

978
01:17:51,964 --> 01:17:54,592
My hands are mediocre,
surely you mean the diamond.

979
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:56,927
Not at all.

980
01:17:57,202 --> 01:17:59,397
The diamond is not much
to speak of.

981
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:02,164
Honestly.

982
01:18:04,343 --> 01:18:05,401
May I, Madame,

983
01:18:05,577 --> 01:18:08,478
abuse your kindness
and visit your salon soon

984
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:09,669
to perform a play

985
01:18:10,115 --> 01:18:13,016
I had the audacity of writing
in your honor.

986
01:18:13,285 --> 01:18:16,482
Mr. Jourdain,
this is no doubt rather fast.

987
01:18:16,822 --> 01:18:19,757
I'll know how to be slow
when the time comes.

988
01:18:24,463 --> 01:18:27,364
My goodness, yes. If you wish.

989
01:18:27,499 --> 01:18:29,194
Come visit one day.

990
01:18:31,336 --> 01:18:33,304
Stay with us, Dorante.

991
01:18:33,539 --> 01:18:34,801
Good day, sir.

992
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:18,206
You deserve to be whipped
for what you said.

993
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:19,774
I know...

994
01:19:19,818 --> 01:19:23,254
We're no longer children,
Jean-Baptiste.

995
01:19:23,288 --> 01:19:24,255
I know...

996
01:19:24,656 --> 01:19:27,557
My place is here.
Not with a troupe of actors.

997
01:19:42,174 --> 01:19:43,232
Well?

998
01:19:44,143 --> 01:19:46,668
My dear wife, what news?

999
01:19:48,347 --> 01:19:49,644
The kitten died.

1000
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:56,615
Where is Henriette?

1001
01:19:56,655 --> 01:19:59,715
In the garden, I believe.

1002
01:19:59,758 --> 01:20:01,783
I have news for her, follow me.

1003
01:20:10,636 --> 01:20:11,625
Sir!

1004
01:20:12,271 --> 01:20:13,363
That's my daughter.

1005
01:20:15,307 --> 01:20:17,036
He's making love to her!

1006
01:20:17,442 --> 01:20:21,071
- A mere kiss.
- Don't play with words.

1007
01:20:21,113 --> 01:20:22,045
Sir,

1008
01:20:22,181 --> 01:20:25,309
it's my fault,
your daughter did nothing.

1009
01:20:25,617 --> 01:20:28,085
Father, I let him,
he'd never have dared.

1010
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:30,745
No, I'm the guilty one.

1011
01:20:30,789 --> 01:20:33,349
- Don't listen to him...
- Get to the point.

1012
01:20:34,293 --> 01:20:35,317
Sir,

1013
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:37,655
I solemnly request
Henriette's hand.

1014
01:20:39,531 --> 01:20:41,556
Are you a gentleman?

1015
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:42,567
I beg your pardon?

1016
01:20:42,734 --> 01:20:45,703
Are you a gentleman?
Do you have a title?

1017
01:20:46,505 --> 01:20:48,564
- No, but...
- Then she's not for you.

1018
01:20:48,874 --> 01:20:49,898
Disappear!

1019
01:20:56,215 --> 01:20:57,512
My daughter,

1020
01:20:58,450 --> 01:21:01,476
I've come to announce
your engagement to Thomas,

1021
01:21:01,653 --> 01:21:03,052
our friend Dorante's son.

1022
01:21:03,255 --> 01:21:05,655
It's agreed.
We must just set a date.

1023
01:21:06,158 --> 01:21:07,955
- Kiss me.
- This will not be.

1024
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:09,184
It will be.

1025
01:21:09,528 --> 01:21:11,018
You'll not reduce me to this.

1026
01:21:11,196 --> 01:21:12,220
I shall indeed.

1027
01:21:12,564 --> 01:21:13,656
I'll kill myself.

1028
01:21:13,832 --> 01:21:15,265
You will not kill yourself.

1029
01:21:17,836 --> 01:21:20,100
Do you wish to break her heart?

1030
01:21:20,339 --> 01:21:21,829
Why force a husband on her?

1031
01:21:21,974 --> 01:21:23,874
We're not in need, are we?

1032
01:21:24,009 --> 01:21:28,343
I have enough money, I want a title.
She'll become a Countess.

1033
01:21:29,448 --> 01:21:30,472
A Countess!

1034
01:21:30,983 --> 01:21:34,384
Countess. And if you make me
angry, it'll be Duchess.

1035
01:21:47,132 --> 01:21:50,192
I am touched, Madame,
by this courtesy visit.

1036
01:21:50,802 --> 01:21:53,100
Courtesy has nothing to do with it.

1037
01:21:53,705 --> 01:21:56,196
- I came to talk business.
- Business?

1038
01:21:57,142 --> 01:22:00,771
How much do you want
to call off this marriage?

1039
01:22:01,446 --> 01:22:03,380
What do you mean? My son...

1040
01:22:03,415 --> 01:22:06,873
Your son has no business
with my daughter

1041
01:22:07,085 --> 01:22:09,315
if not to satisfy your greed.

1042
01:22:09,554 --> 01:22:12,148
I ask you my question
once again:

1043
01:22:13,191 --> 01:22:14,351
how much?

1044
01:22:14,926 --> 01:22:20,023
We shall have to give it
some serious thought.

1045
01:22:20,065 --> 01:22:22,898
The northern façade is cracked...

1046
01:22:23,235 --> 01:22:25,965
The roof leaks everywhere...

1047
01:22:26,071 --> 01:22:29,837
Windows need replacing,
there are over 300 of them!

1048
01:22:30,309 --> 01:22:31,571
30,000 pounds.

1049
01:22:33,278 --> 01:22:36,679
30,000 pounds by tomorrow?
Why did you agree?

1050
01:22:36,982 --> 01:22:38,244
I was desperate!

1051
01:22:39,551 --> 01:22:42,111
- Do you have any money?
- A little.

1052
01:22:43,722 --> 01:22:44,780
2,000 pounds.

1053
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:49,152
Calm down.

1054
01:22:50,128 --> 01:22:51,186
Calm down.

1055
01:22:51,630 --> 01:22:53,257
- We'll find a way.
- How?

1056
01:22:56,968 --> 01:22:57,935
Tomorrow morning...

1057
01:22:58,070 --> 01:22:59,128
No!

1058
01:22:59,338 --> 01:23:00,771
This afternoon...

1059
01:23:00,939 --> 01:23:05,308
This afternoon you'll go out
with your daughter.

1060
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:06,971
You'll say you're going

1061
01:23:07,879 --> 01:23:10,746
for a stroll...
A stroll in the forest. No!

1062
01:23:11,083 --> 01:23:12,243
Around the port.

1063
01:23:12,351 --> 01:23:16,082
Tell your husband
that Henriette needs the ocean air.

1064
01:23:16,355 --> 01:23:18,619
- I don't understand.
- Patience.

1065
01:23:18,657 --> 01:23:21,148
In fact, you won't go to the port.

1066
01:23:22,361 --> 01:23:23,487
You'll go...

1067
01:23:23,595 --> 01:23:25,688
You'll go to the ruins.

1068
01:23:26,431 --> 01:23:29,366
I'll tell Valere,
he'll be waiting for you.

1069
01:23:29,501 --> 01:23:33,335
You'll entrust him
with your daughter. And then...

1070
01:23:42,647 --> 01:23:46,014
Then, Madame, you'll have to
become an actress.

1071
01:23:49,121 --> 01:23:51,089
Help! Help!

1072
01:23:51,189 --> 01:23:52,349
Please!

1073
01:23:52,524 --> 01:23:55,049
For the love of God!

1074
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:56,821
What's wrong? Calm down.

1075
01:23:56,862 --> 01:23:58,090
Oh Sir,

1076
01:23:58,430 --> 01:23:59,658
it's so horrible.

1077
01:24:00,132 --> 01:24:02,191
- Henriette...
- What about Henriette!

1078
01:24:04,836 --> 01:24:06,633
My little girl...

1079
01:24:06,772 --> 01:24:08,535
Speak, Madame, tell me!

1080
01:24:08,673 --> 01:24:09,765
We were at the port

1081
01:24:10,575 --> 01:24:13,442
when the captain of a galley
invited us aboard.

1082
01:24:13,678 --> 01:24:14,872
Oh my God...

1083
01:24:15,313 --> 01:24:17,543
He ordered the moorings
to be raised

1084
01:24:17,616 --> 01:24:19,277
and set out to sea...

1085
01:24:19,384 --> 01:24:21,614
- Oh my God!
- Prisoners of bandits!

1086
01:24:21,753 --> 01:24:23,277
Oh my God!

1087
01:24:23,321 --> 01:24:26,347
They brought me ashore
in a rowboat

1088
01:24:26,525 --> 01:24:28,356
to collect a ransom.

1089
01:24:30,429 --> 01:24:33,557
Should I fail, the galley departs
tonight for Africa,

1090
01:24:34,132 --> 01:24:37,192
where she'll be sold as a slave.

1091
01:24:37,502 --> 01:24:39,197
How much is the ransom?

1092
01:24:40,338 --> 01:24:42,067
50,000 pounds.

1093
01:24:44,810 --> 01:24:46,300
50,000 pounds?

1094
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:52,374
What's she doing on that galley?

1095
01:24:52,551 --> 01:24:55,076
Time is short,
we must gather the sum.

1096
01:24:55,253 --> 01:24:56,515
50,000 pounds!

1097
01:24:57,189 --> 01:24:59,214
Do they know what that means?

1098
01:24:59,458 --> 01:25:00,948
They know, sir.

1099
01:25:00,992 --> 01:25:02,323
Why did she do this?

1100
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:04,658
Quick, sir, I beg of you.

1101
01:25:04,696 --> 01:25:07,221
- Couldn't she have gone elsewhere?
- Surely.

1102
01:25:07,399 --> 01:25:08,388
Blasted galley!

1103
01:25:10,368 --> 01:25:11,733
You're right, Madame.

1104
01:25:12,237 --> 01:25:14,364
Wait for me here,
I'll get the money.

1105
01:25:18,677 --> 01:25:20,167
How was I?

1106
01:25:32,057 --> 01:25:33,991
Why 50,000 pounds?

1107
01:25:34,192 --> 01:25:36,820
Dorante only asked for 30,000.

1108
01:25:36,862 --> 01:25:39,330
How else will we survive
with your troupe?

1109
01:25:40,065 --> 01:25:41,123
We?

1110
01:25:45,003 --> 01:25:48,097
Dry your tears,
your husband will take care of it.

1111
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:49,400
Here.

1112
01:25:49,774 --> 01:25:51,173
But you tell those pirates...

1113
01:25:56,448 --> 01:25:57,676
Daughter?

1114
01:25:57,949 --> 01:25:59,917
You're freed?

1115
01:25:59,951 --> 01:26:03,011
Freed of Valere,
who's a fool and a lout.

1116
01:26:03,488 --> 01:26:04,682
And the galley?

1117
01:26:04,890 --> 01:26:06,482
I should prefer it to him!

1118
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:19,562
Well?

1119
01:26:20,105 --> 01:26:21,732
It was a misunderstanding.

1120
01:26:21,973 --> 01:26:23,440
A misunderstanding?

1121
01:26:23,808 --> 01:26:24,832
Yes.

1122
01:26:25,010 --> 01:26:28,241
They were at odds
over their future plans.

1123
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:30,948
At odds over what?

1124
01:26:32,317 --> 01:26:36,014
Over what to name their child.

1125
01:26:37,489 --> 01:26:41,357
Your daughter ruined everything!
A plague on her bad character!

1126
01:26:42,961 --> 01:26:44,485
I forbid you to say that.

1127
01:26:48,233 --> 01:26:49,530
Madame,

1128
01:26:49,768 --> 01:26:51,702
your daughter sealed her fate.

1129
01:26:52,137 --> 01:26:53,695
What can we do now?

1130
01:26:54,239 --> 01:26:56,298
- I must stay with her.
- And us?

1131
01:26:56,608 --> 01:26:57,768
What about us?

1132
01:27:08,553 --> 01:27:10,953
Your father said you studied law?

1133
01:27:10,989 --> 01:27:13,583
- Trade law, to be exact.
- What a fine idea.

1134
01:27:14,593 --> 01:27:18,962
I wanted a son
to bequeath my business to.

1135
01:27:20,365 --> 01:27:22,333
How is business?

1136
01:27:22,367 --> 01:27:23,493
- I can't complain.
- You're wrong.

1137
01:27:24,569 --> 01:27:26,537
Our laws are reprehensible,

1138
01:27:26,671 --> 01:27:28,696
business in France is impossible.

1139
01:27:29,674 --> 01:27:31,369
But I have concrete ideas

1140
01:27:31,610 --> 01:27:34,443
on ways to increase profits.

1141
01:27:34,479 --> 01:27:38,813
Thomas, I fear this conversation
could lead to boredom.

1142
01:27:39,017 --> 01:27:41,383
Not at all, please continue.

1143
01:27:41,586 --> 01:27:44,817
Did you know you could save
on labor costs

1144
01:27:44,956 --> 01:27:47,424
by setting up shop in Spain,
where people

1145
01:27:47,592 --> 01:27:49,685
earn four times less.

1146
01:27:49,728 --> 01:27:50,786
In Spain!

1147
01:27:51,096 --> 01:27:52,791
And why not China?

1148
01:27:54,666 --> 01:27:57,533
One of our ancestors
was a merchant.

1149
01:27:57,569 --> 01:27:58,729
Is this true?

1150
01:27:59,571 --> 01:28:00,503
No.

1151
01:28:00,605 --> 01:28:01,572
Yes, Father.

1152
01:28:01,706 --> 01:28:03,503
- No.
- Yes.

1153
01:28:03,875 --> 01:28:04,899
- No.
- Yes.

1154
01:28:05,243 --> 01:28:06,733
- No.
- Yes.

1155
01:28:06,778 --> 01:28:10,942
No, no, no! Nasty rumors!
He was never a merchant! Never!

1156
01:28:16,621 --> 01:28:23,493
The simple truth is,
he had a flair for fabrics,

1157
01:28:23,528 --> 01:28:27,589
which he had made in large
quantities for his friends.

1158
01:28:29,267 --> 01:28:31,861
In exchange for a sum of money.

1159
01:28:32,170 --> 01:28:34,104
He was never a merchant.

1160
01:29:18,416 --> 01:29:20,577
What do you think?

1161
01:29:20,618 --> 01:29:24,918
Did you relish the way
I delivered my lines?

1162
01:29:24,956 --> 01:29:28,016
Yes, yes.

1163
01:29:28,059 --> 01:29:30,653
Honestly, I think I'm ready.

1164
01:29:32,263 --> 01:29:33,355
Let it be said now,

1165
01:29:33,965 --> 01:29:35,990
either I triumph tomorrow
at Celimene's

1166
01:29:36,134 --> 01:29:39,126
or you shall find me dead drunk
in a tavern.

1167
01:29:44,509 --> 01:29:47,410
There you are.
I've looked everywhere for you.

1168
01:29:47,746 --> 01:29:51,739
We have so many things to settle
before the marriage.

1169
01:29:52,117 --> 01:29:54,142
Hang the marriage!

1170
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:57,813
What did you say?

1171
01:29:59,924 --> 01:30:01,084
What's wrong?

1172
01:30:02,093 --> 01:30:04,721
I failed miserably.

1173
01:30:04,863 --> 01:30:06,057
What do you mean?

1174
01:30:06,197 --> 01:30:08,791
- She didn't like my play!
- Pure fantasy.

1175
01:30:08,867 --> 01:30:10,858
- I said...
- All lies.

1176
01:30:10,902 --> 01:30:13,427
Not one person applauded!
That's a sign.

1177
01:30:13,538 --> 01:30:15,301
Granted, a sign of respect.

1178
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:18,373
- What did you say?
- You were greatly admired.

1179
01:30:18,476 --> 01:30:22,071
You made a true impression.
Applause was inappropriate.

1180
01:30:22,514 --> 01:30:24,311
I overheard whispering.

1181
01:30:25,884 --> 01:30:28,580
When faced with true beauty,

1182
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:31,020
does one not wish to share it?

1183
01:30:31,089 --> 01:30:34,024
- I saw people yawning.
- Are you sure?

1184
01:30:34,159 --> 01:30:37,822
Were they not sighs of pleasure?

1185
01:30:37,862 --> 01:30:39,557
Of ecstasy?

1186
01:30:40,498 --> 01:30:41,556
No, really,

1187
01:30:41,599 --> 01:30:43,931
you misinterpreted the reactions.

1188
01:30:43,968 --> 01:30:47,404
After you left, certain ladies

1189
01:30:47,438 --> 01:30:49,531
even requested your presence
at their salons.

1190
01:30:49,574 --> 01:30:51,303
Really?

1191
01:30:52,477 --> 01:30:53,466
You think so?

1192
01:30:54,078 --> 01:30:55,204
Mr. Jourdain,

1193
01:30:55,346 --> 01:30:59,442
your play has made you
the darling of high society!

1194
01:31:02,153 --> 01:31:05,088
The darling of high society?
Really?

1195
01:31:05,123 --> 01:31:07,523
The darling of high society...

1196
01:31:07,992 --> 01:31:09,687
People sighed with ecstasy.

1197
01:31:10,061 --> 01:31:15,089
I worked hard, but it's really
all thanks to you,

1198
01:31:15,133 --> 01:31:16,964
Mr. Moliere.

1199
01:31:19,604 --> 01:31:20,628
What's wrong?

1200
01:31:21,105 --> 01:31:22,970
I cannot accept this.

1201
01:31:23,107 --> 01:31:24,438
What about our contract?

1202
01:31:24,642 --> 01:31:27,975
I won her admiration,
the Beauty has been conquered,

1203
01:31:28,213 --> 01:31:30,511
what more do you want?
- Results.

1204
01:31:30,882 --> 01:31:32,110
I'm satisfied, I tell you.

1205
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:34,878
Yes, so you tell me. Yet...

1206
01:31:34,919 --> 01:31:35,977
Yet?

1207
01:31:36,354 --> 01:31:37,343
Well...

1208
01:31:37,622 --> 01:31:39,647
words may not reveal the heart.

1209
01:31:52,871 --> 01:31:56,830
If only there were some way
I could see into Celimene's mind.

1210
01:31:59,477 --> 01:32:00,501
Perhaps there is...

1211
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:03,269
Tell me.

1212
01:32:03,581 --> 01:32:05,572
No, it's too complicated.

1213
01:32:06,384 --> 01:32:08,249
You'd never accept...

1214
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:11,180
Didn't Aristotle himself
prove that...

1215
01:32:11,556 --> 01:32:13,023
Spare us, Marquis.

1216
01:32:14,292 --> 01:32:18,285
Stop using Aristotle
like an umbrella to hide under!

1217
01:32:18,897 --> 01:32:20,728
The image is amusing,

1218
01:32:20,798 --> 01:32:22,527
yet one must choose masters.

1219
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:27,467
Or would you have us
solve the world's problems alone?

1220
01:32:27,505 --> 01:32:30,736
I believe one must not forget
to think critically.

1221
01:32:31,509 --> 01:32:32,737
Constant repetition

1222
01:32:33,111 --> 01:32:35,511
makes of one
a blindfolded donkey.

1223
01:32:41,185 --> 01:32:42,447
Madame,

1224
01:32:42,787 --> 01:32:44,277
a gentleman has arrived.

1225
01:32:44,489 --> 01:32:46,320
A gentleman?
What's his name?

1226
01:32:46,891 --> 01:32:47,949
He wouldn't say.

1227
01:32:48,293 --> 01:32:49,988
Why such mystery?
Show him in.

1228
01:32:51,062 --> 01:32:52,154
Very well, Madame.

1229
01:33:04,375 --> 01:33:06,400
Please excuse
my unusual entrance

1230
01:33:06,477 --> 01:33:08,536
but I was loath to dirty my boots

1231
01:33:08,646 --> 01:33:11,080
in our mud-ridden,
rain-sodden streets.

1232
01:33:14,052 --> 01:33:16,646
Allow me to pay you
my most humble respects.

1233
01:33:17,555 --> 01:33:20,217
Happily,
once I know whom they're from.

1234
01:33:20,258 --> 01:33:23,694
Jean-Baptiste Poquelin, Marquis,
at your service.

1235
01:33:26,230 --> 01:33:28,994
Your entrance
did not lack bravado,

1236
01:33:29,067 --> 01:33:33,663
but I'd be grateful to discover
the object of your visit.

1237
01:33:33,705 --> 01:33:37,232
Your reputation is like a magnet
one cannot resist.

1238
01:33:37,575 --> 01:33:41,534
Merit has such allure
that I seek it wherever I can.

1239
01:33:43,214 --> 01:33:47,150
As regards merit perhaps,
that much we have in common.

1240
01:33:47,185 --> 01:33:49,312
But your reputation I don't know.

1241
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:51,715
I came here in order to
make up for this.

1242
01:33:51,889 --> 01:33:53,652
What better place, I say.

1243
01:33:55,326 --> 01:33:58,352
I'm not one to resist
attacks of friendship.

1244
01:33:58,596 --> 01:34:01,190
Please have a seat.
- I bullied my way in here,

1245
01:34:01,265 --> 01:34:02,823
I won't abuse your chairs.

1246
01:34:04,102 --> 01:34:07,868
It's our time you mustn't abuse.

1247
01:34:07,905 --> 01:34:10,305
Your remarkable entrance
surprised us...

1248
01:34:10,475 --> 01:34:12,409
I'm not one
of those pompous persons

1249
01:34:12,543 --> 01:34:15,376
who come and recite
their poems uninvited.

1250
01:34:15,546 --> 01:34:18,174
If you have verses for us,
we'd be delighted!

1251
01:34:18,316 --> 01:34:19,510
We love literature.

1252
01:34:19,784 --> 01:34:22,810
Well, since you ask,

1253
01:34:22,854 --> 01:34:24,754
here's something
that comes to mind

1254
01:34:25,156 --> 01:34:27,215
which I dedicate to you...

1255
01:34:29,727 --> 01:34:31,126
"I was not on my guard

1256
01:34:31,262 --> 01:34:35,494
"As I gazed at you
with no thoughts of evil

1257
01:34:35,833 --> 01:34:38,768
"Your eye approached on the sly

1258
01:34:38,836 --> 01:34:40,929
"And ran off with my heart.

1259
01:34:42,173 --> 01:34:44,698
"Thief! Thief! Thief! Thief!"

1260
01:34:46,377 --> 01:34:50,814
What angel sent you
to make us laugh like this?

1261
01:34:50,848 --> 01:34:54,215
We're so dreadfully starved
for entertainment.

1262
01:34:54,252 --> 01:34:55,241
What, Madame?

1263
01:34:55,286 --> 01:34:58,687
I thought the greatest minds
jostled their way in here.

1264
01:34:58,956 --> 01:35:00,617
If you knew what we endured.

1265
01:35:00,925 --> 01:35:04,861
It's often a draw between
boredom and the grotesque.

1266
01:35:05,830 --> 01:35:07,422
People jostle, yes,

1267
01:35:07,565 --> 01:35:10,625
only to declare
their unwanted passion.

1268
01:35:10,768 --> 01:35:12,827
Like that poor Mr. Jourdain.

1269
01:35:14,038 --> 01:35:16,438
Mr. Jourdain... you say?

1270
01:35:16,474 --> 01:35:19,034
Imagine a farmyard rooster

1271
01:35:19,143 --> 01:35:20,906
disguised as a pheasant,

1272
01:35:21,045 --> 01:35:24,037
sputtering rhymes in my face
a child of eight

1273
01:35:24,215 --> 01:35:26,206
would no longer dare read.

1274
01:35:27,018 --> 01:35:28,076
You see my predicament.

1275
01:35:28,252 --> 01:35:34,350
Then the oaf gazes stupidly at me
hoping to be loved in return.

1276
01:35:34,392 --> 01:35:36,519
As if I could possibly
be interested

1277
01:35:36,561 --> 01:35:39,724
in every uncouth merchant
and farmer

1278
01:35:39,764 --> 01:35:41,959
who aspires to become a marquis.

1279
01:35:42,266 --> 01:35:44,131
How right you are, Madame.

1280
01:35:50,007 --> 01:35:51,872
How clever your mind is

1281
01:35:52,210 --> 01:35:53,939
at unmasking our weaknesses.

1282
01:35:57,515 --> 01:35:59,676
The truth be told,
I admire you.

1283
01:36:00,351 --> 01:36:03,582
I thought it was your intelligence
that made you

1284
01:36:04,222 --> 01:36:06,019
an exceptional being.

1285
01:36:06,057 --> 01:36:09,652
I realize now it's only your
upbringing that gives you style

1286
01:36:10,228 --> 01:36:14,096
for your soul
is entirely devoted to cruelty.

1287
01:36:14,799 --> 01:36:18,132
You amuse your suite with jokes
about those who are absent.

1288
01:36:18,302 --> 01:36:20,065
But I say it is

1289
01:36:21,072 --> 01:36:23,302
an insult to your beauty,

1290
01:36:23,441 --> 01:36:27,070
your intelligence and your rank

1291
01:36:27,111 --> 01:36:29,375
that you're incapable of stating

1292
01:36:29,514 --> 01:36:33,473
what you truly think to one's face.

1293
01:36:34,385 --> 01:36:36,819
You used the donkey
as an example...

1294
01:36:37,622 --> 01:36:40,716
An animal that waits
until you're not looking

1295
01:36:40,892 --> 01:36:42,484
to kick you.

1296
01:36:45,096 --> 01:36:46,529
I shall go now, Madame,

1297
01:36:47,832 --> 01:36:51,290
and leave you to bray about me
in my absence.

1298
01:37:02,013 --> 01:37:03,640
Madame!

1299
01:37:05,016 --> 01:37:07,541
I guarantee you,
the marriage is off.

1300
01:37:08,386 --> 01:37:12,652
Believe me, that rascal Dorante
is in a tight spot now.

1301
01:37:13,958 --> 01:37:15,983
You lied to me!

1302
01:37:16,761 --> 01:37:18,422
Shamelessly! With no scruples!

1303
01:37:18,563 --> 01:37:21,726
You lied from the start!
You used me.

1304
01:37:23,434 --> 01:37:24,423
Yes.

1305
01:37:25,803 --> 01:37:28,533
I lied to you
about Celimene's sentiments.

1306
01:37:28,973 --> 01:37:30,964
But answer me honestly,

1307
01:37:31,375 --> 01:37:35,004
blind as you were,
would you have accepted the truth?

1308
01:37:36,681 --> 01:37:40,447
Forget about all this,
let's think of the marriage.

1309
01:37:40,585 --> 01:37:43,554
This isn't the moment to evoke
the marriage.

1310
01:37:44,555 --> 01:37:48,992
Quite the contrary,
I think it's urgent we proceed.

1311
01:37:53,998 --> 01:37:56,193
Mr. Jourdain...

1312
01:38:00,938 --> 01:38:03,839
imagine the disastrous
consequences

1313
01:38:03,941 --> 01:38:06,171
that breaking off this engagement

1314
01:38:06,477 --> 01:38:08,445
with me would have for you.

1315
01:38:08,579 --> 01:38:11,571
I am particularly well placed
at Court.

1316
01:38:11,682 --> 01:38:12,944
Your reputation,

1317
01:38:13,150 --> 01:38:14,913
already tarnished

1318
01:38:14,952 --> 01:38:16,943
by this regrettable
affair with the Marquise,

1319
01:38:17,655 --> 01:38:20,749
could be totally destroyed.

1320
01:38:42,046 --> 01:38:43,013
Elmire?

1321
01:39:21,018 --> 01:39:22,815
You were looking for me?

1322
01:39:23,654 --> 01:39:24,643
Yes.

1323
01:39:41,138 --> 01:39:42,435
My husband?

1324
01:39:43,507 --> 01:39:45,805
The wedding takes place tonight.

1325
01:39:47,445 --> 01:39:48,469
Tonight?

1326
01:39:49,413 --> 01:39:51,506
Tell Mr. Tartuffe
I want to see him.

1327
01:39:52,316 --> 01:39:54,045
We wish to be left alone.

1328
01:40:07,131 --> 01:40:08,155
He wants to see you.

1329
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:11,434
The wedding takes place tonight.

1330
01:40:22,813 --> 01:40:25,373
You wished to see me?

1331
01:40:28,853 --> 01:40:30,684
My wife has a lover.

1332
01:40:33,691 --> 01:40:34,680
Pardon me?

1333
01:40:34,825 --> 01:40:38,488
My wife has a lover.
I just discovered it.

1334
01:40:41,999 --> 01:40:43,796
Do you know who it is?

1335
01:40:45,002 --> 01:40:46,629
What matter if he's the cook

1336
01:40:46,871 --> 01:40:49,897
or a marshal of France,
the facts are the same.

1337
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:53,976
Not only have I been humiliated
by the one I pursue,

1338
01:40:55,646 --> 01:40:56,738
I've been cuckolded

1339
01:40:58,449 --> 01:41:00,815
by the one I neglected.

1340
01:41:17,835 --> 01:41:18,893
Mr. Jourdain...

1341
01:41:19,069 --> 01:41:21,367
your wife's lover,

1342
01:41:21,505 --> 01:41:24,065
what would you do if he were
here right now?

1343
01:41:24,408 --> 01:41:25,841
What would I do?

1344
01:41:25,976 --> 01:41:27,773
I'd strangle him,

1345
01:41:28,179 --> 01:41:30,477
slash his guts,
rip his heart out.

1346
01:41:32,616 --> 01:41:34,641
I understand your anger.

1347
01:41:36,053 --> 01:41:38,681
But if he were right here
in front of you?

1348
01:41:39,356 --> 01:41:41,085
Would you listen to him?

1349
01:41:41,292 --> 01:41:44,193
I'd listen to him let out
his last sigh.

1350
01:41:46,897 --> 01:41:48,592
Is that really what you'd do,

1351
01:41:48,899 --> 01:41:50,924
if he were here before you?

1352
01:42:06,750 --> 01:42:09,014
If I were able to contain
my hatred,

1353
01:42:09,653 --> 01:42:11,518
maybe I'd listen to him.

1354
01:42:11,555 --> 01:42:13,318
He has some advice for you.

1355
01:42:13,357 --> 01:42:15,120
Advice, really?

1356
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:19,960
Yes, sir.
Cancel the wedding.

1357
01:42:19,997 --> 01:42:20,986
I don't see...

1358
01:42:21,165 --> 01:42:24,794
Your wife's happiness
is her daughter's happiness.

1359
01:42:26,871 --> 01:42:30,637
This man can't give her that.
Only you can.

1360
01:42:31,275 --> 01:42:33,505
I cannot cancel it.

1361
01:42:35,079 --> 01:42:36,205
In that case...

1362
01:42:36,914 --> 01:42:38,074
Wait!

1363
01:42:39,583 --> 01:42:41,483
Let's say I found a way...

1364
01:42:42,887 --> 01:42:45,219
would this man
give me back my wife?

1365
01:42:45,456 --> 01:42:49,119
Give her back?
Your wife does not belong to him.

1366
01:42:49,426 --> 01:42:50,893
No more than she does to you.

1367
01:42:52,062 --> 01:42:55,225
Then I expect him to retire.

1368
01:42:55,466 --> 01:42:58,560
I expect him to give up my wife

1369
01:42:58,602 --> 01:43:01,969
and disappear forever.

1370
01:43:42,012 --> 01:43:44,173
Will the bride please step forward.

1371
01:43:55,092 --> 01:43:56,354
Mr. Jourdain!

1372
01:43:56,794 --> 01:43:59,388
What's going on? What's wrong?

1373
01:43:59,430 --> 01:44:02,866
A terrible catastrophe, sir!
Your warehouses burned down!

1374
01:44:03,567 --> 01:44:05,660
My warehouses? Which ones?

1375
01:44:05,703 --> 01:44:09,002
All of them! Destroyed.
All is lost!

1376
01:44:09,039 --> 01:44:11,007
You are ruined!

1377
01:44:14,778 --> 01:44:16,837
Nothing shall stop this wedding.

1378
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:19,747
Please continue,
we'll shed tears later.

1379
01:44:19,783 --> 01:44:24,413
My word, I don't know,
we mustn't rush into things.

1380
01:44:24,455 --> 01:44:27,390
I'm ruined, who cares!

1381
01:44:27,558 --> 01:44:29,685
Your estate will suffice for us all.

1382
01:44:30,427 --> 01:44:34,523
And I say we should take some time
to think it over.

1383
01:44:36,467 --> 01:44:37,764
An odd coincidence.

1384
01:44:39,403 --> 01:44:41,166
What do you insinuate?

1385
01:44:41,205 --> 01:44:42,968
It's nothing to do with this.

1386
01:44:43,073 --> 01:44:45,633
Your daughter is always mulish
and pouting.

1387
01:44:45,676 --> 01:44:48,509
Have we committed some fault?

1388
01:44:48,545 --> 01:44:52,811
I want a loving and good-natured
woman for my son.

1389
01:44:52,916 --> 01:44:56,477
If Henriette doesn't want him,
we don't want her.

1390
01:45:00,357 --> 01:45:02,120
I am your servant, sir.

1391
01:45:02,893 --> 01:45:04,383
And I am your valet.

1392
01:45:04,561 --> 01:45:06,085
I kiss your hand.

1393
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:12,230
- You promised she'd be mine!
- I take it back.

1394
01:45:18,242 --> 01:45:21,211
Congratulations,
you played to perfection.

1395
01:45:21,311 --> 01:45:23,609
I only followed your method.

1396
01:45:24,581 --> 01:45:26,173
If Sir no longer needs me...

1397
01:45:26,316 --> 01:45:28,784
To the contrary, stay with us.

1398
01:45:29,086 --> 01:45:30,951
You don't think I'd pay
for a wedding

1399
01:45:30,988 --> 01:45:32,785
and not have it?

1400
01:45:33,090 --> 01:45:35,081
One son-in-law departs, so be it.

1401
01:45:35,592 --> 01:45:37,082
Let the next one enter.

1402
01:45:52,810 --> 01:45:56,371
Come now! At least wait
till you pronounce your vows.

1403
01:46:07,624 --> 01:46:08,613
You're leaving?

1404
01:46:09,193 --> 01:46:10,524
Yes, Madame.

1405
01:46:11,495 --> 01:46:12,484
I...

1406
01:46:15,132 --> 01:46:16,599
My honor demands it.

1407
01:46:17,634 --> 01:46:19,158
Your honor?

1408
01:46:20,237 --> 01:46:22,535
And what does your heart say?

1409
01:46:24,007 --> 01:46:25,201
I don't know.

1410
01:46:26,009 --> 01:46:27,442
You don't know?

1411
01:46:28,445 --> 01:46:29,377
No.

1412
01:46:33,283 --> 01:46:34,716
What do you advise?

1413
01:46:36,186 --> 01:46:39,678
I advise you to save your honor.

1414
01:46:41,892 --> 01:46:43,359
- That is your advice?
- Indeed.

1415
01:46:43,393 --> 01:46:47,329
Then, Madame,
it is advice I shall heed.

1416
01:46:47,364 --> 01:46:50,299
It should not be painful for you.

1417
01:46:50,334 --> 01:46:54,395
No more than giving it was for you.

1418
01:46:56,240 --> 01:46:59,004
I wish you a good journey.

1419
01:47:55,332 --> 01:47:58,267
<i>Madeleine, I swore I'd return</i>

1420
01:47:58,368 --> 01:48:00,336
<i>and here I am!</i>

1421
01:48:01,638 --> 01:48:03,572
<i>I'll be in Paris within days.</i>

1422
01:48:03,707 --> 01:48:07,370
<i>Gather the troupe
and pack your bags, I have plans.</i>

1423
01:48:10,914 --> 01:48:12,643
<i>We're going to travel.</i>

1424
01:48:14,218 --> 01:48:16,311
<i>Hang Paris and its chimeras!
Hang creditors!</i>

1425
01:48:18,055 --> 01:48:21,786
<i>We must practice our profession.</i>

1426
01:48:29,066 --> 01:48:33,059
<i>We'll travel the countryside
for months, years if necessary.</i>

1427
01:48:34,738 --> 01:48:38,538
<i>We'll play in every town,
every village, every hamlet!</i>

1428
01:48:39,610 --> 01:48:41,100
<i>We'll make a name for ourselves,</i>

1429
01:48:44,114 --> 01:48:46,014
<i>the rest will follow in time.</i>

1430
01:49:46,910 --> 01:49:47,899
<i>Ladies,</i>

1431
01:49:48,278 --> 01:49:51,941
<i>you'll be surprised, no doubt,
by the audacity of my visit.</i>

1432
01:49:55,752 --> 01:49:57,310
<i>I was not on my guard</i>

1433
01:49:57,521 --> 01:50:00,490
<i>As I gazed at you
with no thoughts of evil</i>

1434
01:50:00,958 --> 01:50:03,392
<i>Your eye approached on the sly</i>

1435
01:50:03,593 --> 01:50:05,322
<i>And ran off with my heart.</i>

1436
01:50:05,362 --> 01:50:07,592
<i>Thief! Thief! Thief!</i>

1437
01:50:08,699 --> 01:50:09,688
<i>Thief!</i>

1438
01:50:10,968 --> 01:50:12,492
<i>I find this "oh" oh so...</i>

1439
01:50:12,636 --> 01:50:13,830
<i>admirable.</i>

1440
01:50:19,609 --> 01:50:22,442
<i>I don't want that,
only the words I used.</i>

1441
01:50:22,579 --> 01:50:27,175
<i>Fair Marquise, your lovely eyes
make me die of love.</i>

1442
01:50:27,217 --> 01:50:30,880
<i>Of love, fair Marquise,
your lovely eyes make me die.</i>

1443
01:50:31,021 --> 01:50:35,014
<i>Or: Of love, your lovely eyes,
Marquise fair, me make die.</i>

1444
01:50:35,058 --> 01:50:38,050
<i>Or: Your lovely eyes, fair
Marquise, die of love, make me.</i>

1445
01:50:38,395 --> 01:50:40,363
<i>Or: Make me die of love,
lovely eyes, your fair Marquise.</i>

1446
01:50:40,430 --> 01:50:42,796
<i>Yes, but which one is best?</i>

1447
01:50:42,833 --> 01:50:43,822
<i>500 ecus?</i>

1448
01:50:44,001 --> 01:50:47,061
<i>Yes, sir!
And he only gave me two hours.</i>

1449
01:50:47,471 --> 01:50:49,905
<i>What was
she doing on that galley?</i>

1450
01:50:50,574 --> 01:50:51,871
<i>You're right, hurry up!</i>

1451
01:50:52,075 --> 01:50:53,269
<i>Couldn't she go elsewhere?</i>

1452
01:50:53,443 --> 01:50:54,740
<i>No doubt.</i>

1453
01:50:54,845 --> 01:50:56,073
<i>Blasted galley!</i>

1454
01:50:56,313 --> 01:50:58,508
<i>He loves his galley.</i>

1455
01:50:58,548 --> 01:51:02,484
<i>Blasted galley! Traitors!
Devils all of them!</i>

1456
01:51:52,769 --> 01:51:53,861
Madame...

1457
01:51:56,773 --> 01:51:58,138
Sir...

1458
01:51:58,875 --> 01:52:00,172
Madame.

1459
01:52:01,645 --> 01:52:02,771
Sir.

1460
01:52:05,882 --> 01:52:07,179
I cannot tell you

1461
01:52:07,951 --> 01:52:11,648
how much I regret
the manner in which events...

1462
01:52:13,056 --> 01:52:14,853
There's nothing to regret.

1463
01:52:16,860 --> 01:52:18,885
The tears I shed

1464
01:52:18,995 --> 01:52:23,295
were little indeed
compared to the joy I felt

1465
01:52:23,333 --> 01:52:25,893
when I heard what you'd become.

1466
01:52:29,706 --> 01:52:30,695
Deliver me

1467
01:52:31,942 --> 01:52:34,968
from the pain
that's eaten away at me for years,

1468
01:52:35,145 --> 01:52:38,080
which neither success nor applause
have relieved.

1469
01:52:38,215 --> 01:52:40,183
Grant me your forgiveness.

1470
01:52:45,322 --> 01:52:47,984
For what am I to forgive you?

1471
01:52:49,059 --> 01:52:51,994
For having saved my daughter
from a bad marriage?

1472
01:52:53,864 --> 01:52:56,332
For having opened
my husband's eyes

1473
01:52:56,900 --> 01:52:59,733
and making of him
a repentant man?

1474
01:53:00,704 --> 01:53:03,832
For having allowed me
to see my grandchildren grow up?

1475
01:53:06,176 --> 01:53:07,734
As you wish.

1476
01:53:09,913 --> 01:53:12,438
I forgive you all that.

1477
01:53:24,161 --> 01:53:26,425
Come now, Mr. Moliere,

1478
01:53:27,998 --> 01:53:31,434
tragedy never was
your strong point.

1479
01:53:32,536 --> 01:53:34,094
Dry your tears

1480
01:53:35,071 --> 01:53:36,732
and make me laugh

1481
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:39,308
for my few remaining hours.

1482
01:53:39,442 --> 01:53:43,776
I'm afraid the situation
is no laughing matter.

1483
01:53:44,781 --> 01:53:46,408
You're wrong.

1484
01:53:47,651 --> 01:53:52,384
Unhappiness has comic aspects
one should never underestimate.

1485
01:53:55,225 --> 01:53:58,217
How could I joke about
that which makes me weep?

1486
01:53:58,595 --> 01:54:00,893
This type of comedy
does not exist.

1487
01:54:01,431 --> 01:54:02,625
Well then,

1488
01:54:03,500 --> 01:54:04,967
invent it.

1489
01:54:43,573 --> 01:54:46,838
<i>I just learned some fine news
of which I was unaware.</i>

1490
01:54:46,876 --> 01:54:48,036
<i>What?</i>

1491
01:54:48,078 --> 01:54:50,239
<i>You shall wed Mr. Tartuffe.</i>

1492
01:54:50,580 --> 01:54:53,276
<i>My father certainly has this plan
in his head.</i>

1493
01:54:53,583 --> 01:54:55,778
<i>What does your soul say?</i>

1494
01:54:56,720 --> 01:54:57,880
<i>I don't know.</i>

1495
01:54:58,188 --> 01:54:59,655
<i>You don't know.</i>

1496
01:55:00,190 --> 01:55:01,555
<i>No.</i>

1497
01:55:02,025 --> 01:55:03,185
<i>What do you advise?</i>

1498
01:55:03,660 --> 01:55:06,595
<i>I advise you to stay
with your husband.</i>

1499
01:55:07,697 --> 01:55:10,962
<i>- That's your advice?
- Indeed.</i>

1500
01:55:11,901 --> 01:55:14,131
<i>Then it's advice I shall heed.</i>

1501
01:55:14,337 --> 01:55:16,237
<i>It shouldn't be painful for you.</i>

1502
01:55:16,506 --> 01:55:18,804
<i>No more than giving it was for you.</i>

1503
01:55:18,975 --> 01:55:20,602
<i>I only wanted to make you happy.</i>

1504
01:55:20,744 --> 01:55:23,008
<i>And to make you happy
I'll follow it.</i>

1505
01:55:29,786 --> 01:55:32,619
<i>Come now,
stop your silly banter!</i>

1506
01:55:32,722 --> 01:55:33,689
<i>Lovers are mad!</i>

1507
01:55:33,823 --> 01:55:36,815
<i>And you two love each other
more than you know!</i>

1508
02:00:38,394 --> 02:00:41,693
