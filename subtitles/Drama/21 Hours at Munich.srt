2
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:40,495
So the games
of the 20th Olympiad...

3
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:44,763
...begin with the voices of children.
Beautiful, innocent, serene.

4
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:48,804
The setting much more Hansel
and Gretel than Hitler and Göring.

5
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,840
The day is perfect here
in Munich, Germany.

6
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,979
Just nine miles and 30 years
from Dachau.

7
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:57,410
The Olympic Games designed
to heal old wounds.

8
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:01,543
To show history that men and nations
can change for the better.

9
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,576
Come on. Let's go.

10
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:01,638
How are you?

11
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,519
- Hello.
- He's back.

12
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,483
- Hey.
- Hello.

13
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:14,252
Hi.

14
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,226
- Hello, Spitzer.
- Just got in from Holland.

15
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:20,161
- How's the wife?
- Fine. She's still there with the baby.

16
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,995
She'll be coming on in a few days.

17
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,300
Why are you limping, Yossef?

18
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:28,463
I ruptured my knee during
the clean and jerk on the 430.

19
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:30,836
I'm flying home for an operation
tomorrow.

20
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,568
Did you hear about Gaddie here?

21
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:35,475
He placed 12th
in freestyle wrestling.

22
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:37,548
Twelfth out of 50.

23
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,743
Maybe in four years,
a medal in Montreal.

24
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,616
Oh, yes. Go get some rest.

25
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,485
- Good night.
- Good night.

26
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,166
Yes, Ankie.

27
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,097
Yes.

28
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:02,603
It's wonderful here,
but I miss you terribly.

29
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,135
Come two days earlier.

30
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,308
Come two days earlier.

31
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,278
Kiss Anouk for me.

32
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,720
Moshe? Is that you?

33
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,397
Arabs!

34
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,403
Terrorists!

35
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,474
Get out, buddy!

36
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,960
Everybody, get out!

37
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:22,347
- Don't shoot him.
- Hands up.

38
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,117
Help. Help us.

39
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,820
Arabs with guns. Help us.

40
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:41,023
Arabs with guns.

41
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,599
31 Connollystrasse.

42
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,168
Come on.

43
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:52,976
Keep going. Keep going!

44
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:58,775
- You. Against the wall.
- Send in their guide.

45
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,818
Get over here, get over here.

46
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,886
You too. You too.

47
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,122
Put your hands up.

48
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:13,091
None of your friends
can hear you here.

49
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,493
Now...

50
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,169
...if you lead me to the rest
of your delegation...

51
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,672
...and announce yourself at the door,
I will let you go.

52
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,613
Where is Lalkin?

53
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,543
Weinberger?

54
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,081
Get up against the wall.

55
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:07,445
Hands up.

56
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,111
Help! Somebody!

57
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,230
Better call the police.

58
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:36,440
Any Israelis in there?

59
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,476
Then who's in there?

60
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:43,679
Uruguays. South Americans.

61
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,073
How many Israelis in there?

62
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,207
David.

63
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,036
David.

64
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:13,677
- Did you hear that?
- What?

65
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:30,893
Get up.

66
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,655
Move.

67
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:34,727
Hands on your head.

68
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:42,764
Move.

69
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,122
- Did you hear that?
- Sounded like automatic fire.

70
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:51,741
Go on!

71
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,756
Hey!

72
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:25,608
Stop!

73
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,027
Go back.

74
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:46,212
Schreiber.

75
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,246
My God.

76
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,414
How many hostages?

77
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,254
Well, send a man over there
and find out.

78
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:00,421
Not from the Olympic Village.
One of my men.

79
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:05,630
Also, send 20 men and seal off
all the access routes to Building 31.

80
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,965
Surround it without the terrorists
seeing you.

81
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,850
You will tell your superiors that any
attempt to interfere with our mission...

82
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:59,184
...will bring about the immediate
liquidation of all Zionist prisoners.

83
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:01,383
How do we know
what prisoners you have?

84
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:52,439
Dr. Schreiber, our men
have surrounded Building 31...

85
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:55,977
...but the East German delegation
refuses to move.

86
00:21:57,516 --> 00:22:00,246
Go over there. Remind them
that they're in West Germany...

87
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:03,149
...and tell them to get out.
- Right.

88
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,961
"The revolutionary organization
Black September...

89
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:14,826
...demands that by 9 a.m.,
the Israeli military regime...

90
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,299
...free 236 revolutionary prisoners...

91
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,633
...whose names are listed herewith."

92
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,346
They're also asking Bonn
for three long-distance planes...

93
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:32,574
...to carry them and their hostages
to a country of their choice.

94
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:35,552
"If the deadline is not met...

95
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:40,181
...the Zionist prisoners
will be executed forthwith."

96
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:43,157
The Olympics.

97
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:46,764
Six years we have worked
for this dream here in Munich...

98
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,524
...and now this.

99
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,460
Mayor Troger, it's not just Munich.

100
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:53,797
It's our whole country.

101
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:57,639
Six million ghosts
have come back to haunt us.

102
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:00,744
Gentlemen...

103
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:04,473
...the problem is that we have
several heavily armed men...

104
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:06,810
...holding as many as 10 hostages...

105
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:10,716
...in a highly populated area
of the Olympic Village.

106
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,289
They've already killed
at least one man.

107
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:16,188
And our job is to see
that they kill no more.

108
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,630
It seems to me that only the Israeli
government can prevent that.

109
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,730
Minister Merk...

110
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,063
...the crime is occurring here.

111
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,899
It's our responsibility.

112
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:33,373
It is obvious they picked the Olympics
in order to draw maximum attention...

113
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:36,480
...to their political grievances
over Palestine.

114
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:39,583
This is the same organization
that slaughtered all those people...

115
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,616
...at Lod Airport last May.

116
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,017
The International Olympics
Committee must be informed...

117
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,057
...of any decisions we make.
- All right. Let's get them here.

118
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:49,921
Brundage, Daume, all the others.

119
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:53,531
But I'll tell you, the only way
to defuse a situation like this...

120
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:56,428
...is to start talking to the terrorists
right now.

121
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:59,369
But who will talk to them?

122
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,868
Well, at the moment, none of us.

123
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,704
Not even a policeman,
because the uniform...

124
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:10,074
...would put them on the defensive.

125
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,316
I think it should be a member
of the Olympic security forces.

126
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:16,779
And preferably a woman.

127
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,817
Now do you believe us?

128
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:23,059
We'll kill them all.
Starting at 9:00.

129
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,093
And then we throw their bodies
in the street.

130
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:28,198
Do you understand?

131
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:38,565
Hello.

132
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:40,402
What do you think
you're doing here?

133
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:43,639
Come down. I want to talk to you.

134
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:46,113
Yeah, that's right, you.

135
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:11,099
- What do you want?
- Don't point that thing at me.

136
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:13,039
I have no gun.

137
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:16,510
I mean, it might go off, you know,
and then what?

138
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:31,356
Who are you?

139
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:34,997
Fräulein Graes, of the Women's
Olympic Security Service.

140
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,127
We have no women in here.

141
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:41,071
Think you can charm your way
in because you're a woman?

142
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,867
Well, you're speaking to me,
aren't you?

143
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:45,871
There's nothing wrong in that,
is there?

144
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:51,240
How many hostages do you have?
What are their names?

145
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:52,815
What's the difference?

146
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:55,009
- You know we have them.
- Yeah.

147
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:58,019
But Israel will want to know
who they're bargaining for.

148
00:25:58,189 --> 00:25:59,986
I mean, maybe you've killed
them already.

149
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:03,423
No. We did not come here
to shed blood.

150
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,825
We came here to take them
all alive.

151
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:08,932
To show the world that the fedayeen
are not cruel warriors.

152
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,160
Our only mission is to free
our comrades from Israeli jails.

153
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:15,667
But this is not Israel.
Your comrades are not here...

154
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,832
...and you don't have
236 hostages in there.

155
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:22,278
You seek justice in numbers?

156
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:26,213
What about the millions of
Palestinians evicted by the Jews?

157
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:28,551
But why bring your holy war here?

158
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:31,481
The world cannot stay blind
to the tragedy of Palestine...

159
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:32,918
...here at the Olympics.

160
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,218
We've been dead and forgotten
for years now.

161
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,352
Well, you know, we can do nothing
about freeing political prisoners...

162
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:41,158
...in another country.

163
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,233
We can only transmit your terms.

164
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:45,869
Why not give us conditions
that are possible to meet?

165
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,734
I have.

166
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,340
Free them all if you don't want
the hostages to die.

167
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:59,548
Good day, fräulein.

168
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:03,013
Move.

169
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:16,393
This is still the Olympics,
gentlemen.

170
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:18,762
They've gone on for nearly
3000 years...

171
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,692
...and no petty political hoodlums
are going to stop them now.

172
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:28,004
I am placing all the security forces
in the Village...

173
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:30,300
...under Dr. Schreiber's
police command.

174
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:34,739
And I am here to give the full support
and aid of the federal government.

175
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:40,641
Thank you, Minister Genscher.
I need all the help I can get.

176
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,646
You've contained those Arabs
over on Connollystrasse?

177
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:49,016
We have the building surrounded.
We're still waiting word from Israel.

178
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:51,861
Until then, we're only working
with one hand.

179
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,157
Just so long as it's a firm hand.

180
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,661
Some gentlemen want to talk to you.

181
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:31,429
Talk means nothing.

182
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,635
You said you didn't want to kill.

183
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:36,865
You didn't say
you didn't want to talk.

184
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,370
Who are they?

185
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:45,641
Dr. Schreiber
of the Munich police...

186
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:50,311
...Bavarian Interior Minister Merk
and a gentleman from Egypt...

187
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:53,020
...a member of
the International Olympic Committee.

188
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,750
Okay.

189
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,737
Stop right there.

190
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:13,609
We haven't an answer for you yet.

191
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:18,080
In 10 minutes, if I don't have
an affirmative response...

192
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:21,441
...I will kill a hostage
right where you're standing.

193
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:25,689
Look. You've got to believe us.
We are doing everything we can.

194
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:28,758
To show our good faith, the three
of us are willing, right now...

195
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:30,588
...to take the place of the hostages.

196
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:34,526
You are not my enemies.

197
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:38,264
Brother, Israel has
just received the list.

198
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:41,428
It is a very long list indeed.
Be reasonable.

199
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:44,598
Give them time to study it
before you take any action.

200
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:47,074
They have had already
reasonable time.

201
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:50,578
Now each hour
will cost them one hostage.

202
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:54,110
That's not reasonable.
It's plain murder.

203
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:58,645
If you do that, your hostages
are no longer hostages.

204
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:02,254
They're just people
you were going to kill anyway.

205
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:04,358
And the whole world will know it.

206
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,131
- How much time?
- Six hours.

207
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:11,791
That's ridiculous.

208
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:15,303
Five hours, then. Please.

209
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:19,203
Three.

210
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:23,542
Twelve o'clock noon, then.

211
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:28,444
It's the prime minister.

212
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,119
Madam Prime Minister.

213
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:42,399
Yes. We've managed
to extend the deadline...

214
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,592
...three more hours till 12:00 noon.

215
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:46,197
Thank God for that.

216
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:51,772
I'll do everything in my power
to free the Israeli athletes.

217
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:55,470
But may I suggest that...
That you make some offer.

218
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:57,808
A partial promise.

219
00:31:57,982 --> 00:32:01,213
For example, if they will free
the hostages...

220
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:04,014
...Israel will agree to turn loose...

221
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,023
...a portion of the Arab prisoners in...

222
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:09,386
In a few days.

223
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:14,862
Mr. Chancellor, my position
is a clear one.

224
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:18,525
Israel will, under no conditions...

225
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:23,231
...make the slightest concession
to terrorist blackmail.

226
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:27,705
My government is completely
behind me on this.

227
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:30,370
These men are murderers.

228
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:34,006
They have proven this
over and over again.

229
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:36,016
If we should give in...

230
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:41,181
...no Israeli anywhere in the world
can feel safe.

231
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:46,395
I am concerned only with the lives
of the Israeli hostages in Munich...

232
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:48,031
...at this moment.

233
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:50,565
Munich is a German city.

234
00:32:50,735 --> 00:32:54,671
The murder of Mr. Moshe Weinberger,
and the taking hostage...

235
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:57,433
...of 10 athletes and officials...

236
00:32:57,608 --> 00:33:00,236
...are domestic German crimes.

237
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:04,609
I know that Germany would never
abandon to terrorists...

238
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:08,878
...guests taken hostage
in its territory.

239
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:13,012
That is correct. But, please,
I urge you to submit my suggestion...

240
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:14,283
...to your cabinet.

241
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:20,628
I beg of you, Mr. Chancellor,
do not abandon our children.

242
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:14,045
Fräulein!

243
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:17,446
Tell your friend Schreiber
to get these men off the roofs...

244
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,055
...or I shoot a hostage.

245
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:21,551
I give him 15 minutes.

246
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:44,747
They have run into some telex trouble
with Israel.

247
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:48,579
Atmospheric conditions
are very poor today.

248
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:56,584
Well, let's hope for the sake
of the hostages they quickly improve.

249
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,820
How are the hostages?

250
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,031
I'm only asking in case
someone needs a doctor.

251
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:08,831
No one needs a doctor any longer.

252
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,874
Then there are more dead in there.

253
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:14,306
Yes, one.

254
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:16,439
Who is he?

255
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,343
Tell me that much.

256
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,950
Someone called Romano.
A weightlifter.

257
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,487
Why don't you stop all this killing?

258
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:30,593
Look, we didn't mean to kill
those two men, but we had no choice.

259
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:34,390
We did not come here to kill anyone,
especially Jews in Germany.

260
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:37,932
- You know what the world will say.
- They are saying it already.

261
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,765
I just want to get my brothers
out of jail.

262
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:43,804
Your brothers?

263
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,609
You mean, your comrades.

264
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:50,680
No, two of my own brothers.

265
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:13,733
In a word, the Israeli government
is refusing to release...

266
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:16,169
...a single political prisoner.

267
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:18,399
That is correct.

268
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:23,405
Mr. Ambassador,
do you know what this means?

269
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:26,849
Unless the terrorists collapse...

270
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,784
...the only way to save your people
now is by force.

271
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:33,187
Are you willing to take that risk?

272
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:38,351
Dr. Schreiber, what you plan
to do now is entirely up to you.

273
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,642
Dr. Schreiber would like
to speak with you.

274
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:02,316
Another last-minute appeal,
Herr Doctor?

275
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,787
Listen to me.

276
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,827
Israel still hasn't had time
to complete the files...

277
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:13,224
...on the 200 and some-odd...

278
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:16,161
Then in nine minutes,
we start shooting the hostages.

279
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:18,700
- I asked you to listen...
- Don't come any closer.

280
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:37,819
If what you wanna do
is murder Israelis...

281
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:40,423
...we can't do anything to stop you...

282
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:44,217
...any more than we can make
a decision for another country.

283
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,590
But have no illusions.

284
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:50,530
If you kill them, we kill you.

285
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,999
We are not afraid to die.

286
00:37:55,740 --> 00:38:00,234
In that case,
you'll find us most obliging.

287
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:03,579
Who is the new visitor?

288
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,581
Mohammed Khadif
of the Arab League.

289
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:22,961
Paulo.

290
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:46,454
Now, when we finish talk
in good faith...

291
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:49,286
...I will return to the second floor
where I've entrusted...

292
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,894
...the safety device of this weapon
to my comrade.

293
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:53,997
All right? Is that clear?

294
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,531
We have not come here
to trick you.

295
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,597
We are all looking for a solution.

296
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:00,731
There is only one solution:

297
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,770
The liberation
of all fedayeen prisoners...

298
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,737
...from the jails of occupied Palestine.

299
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,877
You must understand.
We are in the midst...

300
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:10,502
...of extremely delicate negotiations
with Israel.

301
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:14,350
Mohammed Khadif,
have you, too, come to trick me?

302
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:19,882
Brother, I speak to you as an Arab.

303
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:24,722
I, too, wish to see our comrades
released from Israeli prisons...

304
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:28,160
...but I don't want to see you
hurt your own cause.

305
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:34,104
Give the German more time to
bargain with Israel for a final answer.

306
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:36,102
Always more time.

307
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:39,299
I give them an hour, they take two.
I give them 20...

308
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:42,105
They are doing everything they can.

309
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:44,504
They don't want more Jews
to die here.

310
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:47,207
That's what will happen.
And it will be on their heads...

311
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:51,014
...for all the world to see.
- No, it will be on our heads.

312
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:53,313
Show the world
that we are human beings.

313
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:56,791
You will never have
a better opportunity.

314
00:39:57,962 --> 00:40:00,726
The West German authorities
have authorized me...

315
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,731
...to offer you any amount of money
you want...

316
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:06,392
...and safe conduct
out of the country...

317
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,429
...if you will release the hostages.

318
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:13,407
That kind of money would be very
valuable to your organization.

319
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:16,506
No, brother.

320
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:21,777
You mean well, but why bother me
with such useless proposals?

321
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:25,410
We don't want money.
And we don't want to hurt anyone.

322
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:28,387
We just want to get our comrades
out of jail.

323
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:32,552
- And we are prepared to die for it.
- Then give them the time to do it.

324
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,458
Give them until 5:00 at least.

325
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:40,696
They have given me their word
that nothing will be tried against you.

326
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:44,166
Otherwise, I would not have come.

327
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:55,150
All right. But if by 5:00
Israel has not answered yes...

328
00:40:55,319 --> 00:41:00,222
...to all our demands, the executions
will begin punctually. No more talking.

329
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,922
Suspend the games? For how long?

330
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:07,296
Until the crisis is resolved,
Mr. Brundage.

331
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:14,397
Well, I wouldn't oppose
a temporary suspension.

332
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:19,407
As a policeman, I'm against
cancellation for a very simple reason.

333
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:22,774
Tens of thousands of people
are attending these games...

334
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:26,974
...and if they're cancelled, most will
descend on Connollystrasse...

335
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,278
...making my job next to impossible.

336
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:33,082
I'll have to divert hundreds of police
in order to keep the crowds back.

337
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:39,028
May I suggest a temporary suspension
toward the end of the afternoon...

338
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:42,188
...when there is a normal break
in the games anyway.

339
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,663
All right. But then...

340
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,401
...what do we do now?

341
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:53,438
I think we keep talking
and hope they make a mistake.

342
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:06,812
Your two brothers in prison,
when did you last see them?

343
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:14,225
Two years ago. A family reunion.

344
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,699
Your parents as well?

345
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,397
Yes.

346
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,897
They are separated now.

347
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:27,043
But my mother still lives
in Nazareth.

348
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:32,777
But Nazareth, it is in Israel, no?

349
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,309
Galilee.

350
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,881
My mother is a Jew,
as a matter of fact.

351
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:43,149
Why do you look so surprised?

352
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:45,185
You know, I was born in Nazareth...

353
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:48,092
...Iong before it was occupied
by the Zionists.

354
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:56,167
My father is Jordanian.

355
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,939
What does he do?

356
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:04,747
He's a merchant.

357
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,712
He does very well.

358
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,686
It's been a very good life.

359
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:13,948
Always plenty of money,
plenty of women.

360
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:17,359
I've traveled and studied abroad.

361
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:24,223
But all that means nothing now.

362
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,971
There are five entrances
to the apartment.

363
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:41,140
The upper and lower windows,
front and back. And the lobby door...

364
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:43,582
...which can be reached
from underground and front.

365
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:48,657
Minister Merk, a frontal assault
like that would result in a massacre.

366
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:52,023
We don't know how many hostages
there are, where they are...

367
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:53,424
...or if they're together.

368
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:57,033
And most frustrating, we don't know
how many terrorists there are.

369
00:43:57,201 --> 00:44:01,763
What we do know is that
they control an armed fortress.

370
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:06,006
We've got to get inside
and see where they are.

371
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:09,877
Stop there.

372
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:13,846
Put down the boxes.

373
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:59,293
Now you can tell your policemen
to go back and change their clothes.

374
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:00,930
We can manage from here.

375
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:31,785
- Who are they?
- From the international youth camp.

376
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:11,155
The radio broadcasts have been
telling us for the last two hours...

377
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,888
...that Israel long ago
rejected our demands...

378
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:16,191
...thereby sentencing
their countrymen to death.

379
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:20,359
Every radio station in the world is
speculating as to what might happen.

380
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:24,701
It doesn't matter.
You've played around with us too long.

381
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:28,235
We have decided to leave Germany
with the hostages.

382
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,911
In one hour, I want
the three planes and crews...

383
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:35,244
...which we requested this morning.

384
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:39,220
We shall fly to Egypt. When we land,
we want to find waiting for us...

385
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:41,755
...at Cairo Airport every
one of the prisoners...

386
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:43,290
...whose release we demanded.

387
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,858
If they're not there,
before leaving the plane...

388
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:49,658
...we will execute all the hostages.
Without exception.

389
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:51,765
A moment, please.

390
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:10,513
What he is saying is that he does not
wish to kill the hostages here.

391
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:13,850
We certainly have no intention
of letting them leave the country.

392
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:16,993
Yes, but we can't let them know that.

393
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:23,155
I warn you that trying
to get three planes...

394
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:26,769
...in one hour is absolutely impossible.
It will be hard enough to get one.

395
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:38,710
All right. One will do.

396
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:44,946
Good. But to find a long-range plane,
service it, work out the transfer...

397
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:47,454
...all that could never be done
in one hour.

398
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:49,524
We would need at least three.

399
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:57,123
Seven o'clock. No later.

400
00:48:57,501 --> 00:48:59,162
Just a minute.

401
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:02,495
How do we know the Israelis
are still alive?

402
00:49:02,673 --> 00:49:06,632
Before we fulfill our end of the bargain,
I insist that we see them.

403
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:13,946
Get a Jew.
Bring him to the window.

404
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:23,351
That one. Untie his legs.

405
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:30,061
Come.

406
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:32,030
Up!

407
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:49,841
- Good day, gentlemen.
- Good day, dear sir.

408
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,648
I am Bruno Merk,
minister of the interior...

409
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,415
...for the free state of Bavaria.

410
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:57,520
I am Andre Spitzer...

411
00:49:57,694 --> 00:50:01,824
...fencing master and coach
of the Israeli Olympic team.

412
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:05,191
We want you to know that we are
doing everything humanly possible...

413
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:08,463
...to get you released.
- I thank you, sir...

414
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:11,336
...in the name of all my comrades.

415
00:50:11,742 --> 00:50:15,701
- How many of you are still alive?
- No, don't answer that.

416
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:27,153
- Ask only what we agreed on.
- Listen, you animal.

417
00:50:27,324 --> 00:50:29,849
No blackmail in the world
can make us accept the word...

418
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:32,860
...of a single Israeli
with a gun in his back.

419
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:37,057
We're not doing a damn thing for you
until we've seen every hostage alive.

420
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:40,499
And what's more, we are not letting
a single hostage go anywhere...

421
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:42,501
...unless he agrees to it.

422
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:48,839
One moment.

423
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:01,715
They're scared. They know Israel
won't deal with them.

424
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,792
They wanna get out of here.

425
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:07,561
- Has Chancellor Brandt arrived yet?
- He has just arrived in the Village.

426
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,029
Go and transmit
their new demands to him.

427
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,929
All right.

428
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:17,401
To show you our humanity
and goodwill...

429
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:20,973
...I will grant this favor
to only two of you.

430
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:26,275
Dr. Schreiber and you, Mr. Genscher.
Take off your coats.

431
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:31,081
He doesn't like you very much.

432
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:33,518
He might simply add us
to his collection.

433
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:36,853
Maybe. Maybe not.

434
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:36,016
Gentlemen, I'm Manfred Schreiber
of the Munich police...

435
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:39,280
...and this is Mr. Genscher
of the federal government.

436
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:40,684
- Hello.
- Hello.

437
00:52:40,857 --> 00:52:43,485
You have all been told
of the commander's decision...

438
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,823
...to fly all of you to Cairo?
- Yes, we have.

439
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,989
I want to make our position clear.

440
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:54,069
We cannot allow this unless
each and every one of you...

441
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:56,330
...agrees to leave
the Olympic Village.

442
00:52:56,506 --> 00:53:01,273
Dr. Schreiber, whether we leave
the Olympic Village or not...

443
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:03,708
...we know we are dead men.

444
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:05,513
There are nine hostages.

445
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:08,446
Altogether on the second floor
rear bedroom.

446
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:10,916
Could you identify their pictures?

447
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:15,456
Yes. Was there a terrorist
on the balcony when we were inside?

448
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:19,459
No. He went in when you did. There
was just the one outside with us.

449
00:53:19,629 --> 00:53:21,563
How many did you see inside?

450
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:25,565
- Four, including the leader.
- Then there are only five.

451
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:31,005
I don't know. The doors to the back
bedroom were closed downstairs...

452
00:53:31,174 --> 00:53:33,369
...and then there's the front room
upstairs.

453
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,875
Might have been more.

454
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:47,919
Herr Schreiber?
General Zamir is here.

455
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:57,928
- Manfred Schreiber, how do you do?
- How do you do, sir?

456
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:09,234
They say President Sadat
has still not returned to the capital.

457
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:14,582
Then tell them I wish to speak
to Prime Minister Sedki.

458
00:54:16,052 --> 00:54:18,987
- David Marc Berger, the American.
- American?

459
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:23,457
Yeah, dual citizenship.
He's engaged to an Israeli girl.

460
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:27,620
He was badly beaten.
He has a bandage on his shoulder.

461
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:32,432
Ze'ev Friedman,
our bambino weightlifter.

462
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:37,797
- Yossef Gutfreund.
- He's been beaten around the face.

463
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:40,099
None of them complained.

464
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,272
Eliezer Halfin, wrestler.

465
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:50,115
This must be the dead one.

466
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:52,747
I didn't see his face.

467
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,784
Romano.

468
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:58,890
Do you know that this big bruiser
was a window dresser?

469
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:04,757
He went out yesterday to look
at the window displays in Munich.

470
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,668
Young Mark Slavin.

471
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:12,273
He only left Russia four months ago.

472
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:16,207
Amitzur Shapira, our track coach.

473
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:20,708
Kehat Shorr.

474
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,147
Spitzer, of course.

475
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:30,024
Yacov Springer.

476
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:37,829
Poor Moshe.

477
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:43,102
Excuse me.

478
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,179
May I ask...

479
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:59,019
...Dr. Schreiber, what is preventing
an immediate assault on Building 31?

480
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:04,926
General, the latest demands
have been telexed to Jerusalem.

481
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:10,064
And Chancellor Brandt
is still trying to get through to Cairo.

482
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:13,566
Now whether these diplomatic efforts
succeed or not...

483
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:17,599
...we're still going through with
the plan to transfer the terrorists...

484
00:56:17,774 --> 00:56:19,935
...and the nine hostages
to the airport.

485
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:24,279
You mean that you're going to...?

486
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:27,610
We have no intention of letting them
leave Germany.

487
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:33,050
Good evening, Mr. Prime Minister.

488
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:37,252
I can't hear you very clearly.

489
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:40,954
I said, good evening,
Mr. Prime Minister.

490
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:44,258
To what do I owe the honor
of this call?

491
00:56:45,368 --> 00:56:48,667
The perpetrators
of the Connollystrasse attack...

492
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:52,899
...have announced they want to go
to Cairo with their hostages, sir.

493
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:56,512
The final ultimatum expires in...
Heinz?

494
00:56:56,813 --> 00:56:59,805
In one hour and 40 minutes.

495
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:02,776
We would be willing
to let them go...

496
00:57:02,952 --> 00:57:07,582
...if you will agree to intervene the
moment the plane lands in Cairo...

497
00:57:08,024 --> 00:57:11,960
...to ensure that the fedayeen
do not kill the hostages.

498
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:15,894
And that the plane will immediately
be able to continue safely...

499
00:57:16,065 --> 00:57:19,193
...on to Israel
with the nine athletes.

500
00:57:19,369 --> 00:57:22,031
I do not believe your plan
a valid solution.

501
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:25,368
At any rate, it is unworkable.
This is not an Egyptian matter.

502
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:32,107
Mr. Prime Minister, I am asking you
to join in a plan to save human lives.

503
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:35,843
I fail to see how or why Egypt
should be involved...

504
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:38,283
...in what is taking place in Munich.

505
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:43,658
Because, sir, the fedayeen
plan to fly to Egypt.

506
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:46,824
Good night, Mr. Chancellor.

507
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:55,697
The Riem Airport
is too close to town.

508
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:58,363
It's much too large to contain.

509
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:01,970
They could take more hostages there,
or even another plane.

510
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:06,343
And we'd never convince the terrorists
to make that short a helicopter trip.

511
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:08,574
A helicopter?

512
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:12,454
I don't wanna transport them
by car or by bus...

513
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:15,284
...because they'd commandeer it
right to the aircraft steps.

514
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:17,892
I've got to get them
to walk out in the open.

515
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:21,593
Fürstenfeldbruck.

516
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,102
Stand by your cars, please.

517
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:38,475
You'll be getting instructions soon.
All right?

518
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:54,589
In my opinion, gentlemen...

519
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:58,393
...the longer you negotiate, the more
important you make them feel.

520
00:58:58,568 --> 00:59:01,594
As long as we keep them talking,
there will be no more killings.

521
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:04,740
A blitzkrieg now would only
lose more hostages.

522
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:09,034
Some may die, yes,
but others may be saved.

523
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:12,875
Your parleying may end
in having them all killed.

524
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,485
Would you wait here, general?

525
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:39,837
Is our plane ready?

526
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:43,570
- It won't be ready before 8.
- You said 7.

527
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:47,147
The simple fact is we are having
trouble getting a crew to volunteer.

528
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:48,750
Have you heard from Israel?

529
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:52,548
- Frankly, no.
- I've had enough.

530
00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:55,816
I told you, we're not going to let you
play around with us any longer!

531
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,656
You can kill all of us
right here, right now...

532
00:59:58,828 --> 01:00:02,662
...that still won't get you your plane.
We need a few more hours.

533
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:21,774
At 9:00, I want two buses
waiting for us...

534
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:24,078
...at the underground door
to Building 31.

535
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:27,588
You hear those people out there?

536
01:00:27,757 --> 01:00:30,453
They're just itching
to get their hands on you.

537
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:34,256
If we drove you out of here, a million
of them would tear you apart.

538
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:38,491
Come on, doctor. Riem is only
8 kilometers from here.

539
01:00:38,668 --> 01:00:41,398
If only you could give us
a motorcycle escort.

540
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:44,199
They'd brush aside the escort
and hang you.

541
01:00:44,941 --> 01:00:47,307
Crowds are beginning to gather
at Riem Airport.

542
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:51,538
They are ready to fight with their
bare hands to save the Israelis.

543
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:55,215
Your German guilt runs deep.

544
01:00:55,785 --> 01:00:57,548
You, sir...

545
01:00:58,121 --> 01:01:00,112
...you don't know
the meaning of guilt.

546
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:06,225
We're flying you to Fürstenfeldbruck
by helicopter at 9:00.

547
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:07,863
Have your hostages ready.

548
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:20,366
We will have a controlled situation
out here.

549
01:01:20,543 --> 01:01:23,137
The field is completely fenced in...

550
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:27,305
...to keep out crowds
and prevent any escape.

551
01:01:27,884 --> 01:01:30,250
That's where the plane will be.

552
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:35,988
A hundred police have already sealed
off the base around the tower...

553
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:39,458
...and they're backed by
200 more around the fence.

554
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:42,223
We've assembled two squads
of motorized police...

555
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:44,628
...and six armored cars.

556
01:01:44,801 --> 01:01:48,396
And also a shock commando group
of 23 men...

557
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:51,734
...with bulletproof vests,
in case they're needed.

558
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:55,036
Now, the first helicopter
will land just about here.

559
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:03,644
Herr Feldhaus is my deputy chief.

560
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:06,721
He's in charge of the entire operation
here at the airport.

561
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:11,383
These men here, they are the finest
marksmen in the Bavarian police.

562
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,586
You mean they're not
Bundeswehr soldiers?

563
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:16,926
I can assure you, the Bundeswehr
has no sharper eyes...

564
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:20,536
...nor steadier hands
than our own Bavarian police.

565
01:02:20,703 --> 01:02:24,104
Here, let me show you the five
sniping points we have selected.

566
01:02:24,674 --> 01:02:27,234
The other helicopter will
go down right about there...

567
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,537
...forming a line with the 737...

568
01:02:29,712 --> 01:02:32,579
...which will be standing
approximately 80 meters away...

569
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,410
...right over there.

570
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:37,412
There will be three marksmen
up here.

571
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:40,454
One down below
and one behind the hut.

572
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:42,921
That whole area down there
will be too dark.

573
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:47,159
We're putting in more lights.
Don't worry, it will be as clear as day.

574
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:48,958
Make sure.

575
01:02:49,132 --> 01:02:53,535
Excuse me, but why are there
only five sniping positions?

576
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:56,770
According to the number
of known terrorists.

577
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:59,931
But you can't be sure
there are not more than five.

578
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:01,440
You're right, general.

579
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:04,739
We have nine other marksmen
in reserve.

580
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,485
What do you think, general?

581
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:16,515
The layout here...

582
01:03:16,692 --> 01:03:18,626
...disturbs me.

583
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:20,695
Really disturbs me.

584
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:24,456
I think the attack should take place
in the Village...

585
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:28,297
...before the hostages
even reach the helicopter.

586
01:03:32,775 --> 01:03:34,766
If it's possible...

587
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:37,506
...we'll try the Village first.

588
01:05:13,976 --> 01:05:18,436
Gentlemen, Cairo refuses
to intervene.

589
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:20,775
The terrorists promise
to kill the hostages...

590
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:24,044
...if Israel refuses to negotiate.

591
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:28,257
We must draw the line.

592
01:05:28,824 --> 01:05:31,156
An honorable nation
does not get rid of its guests...

593
01:05:31,327 --> 01:05:33,659
...by shipping them outside
of its borders...

594
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:36,389
...tied up like packages
of unregistered freight.

595
01:05:36,899 --> 01:05:41,927
Nor can we stand with arms crossed
while our guests are murdered.

596
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,239
I see no helicopters.

597
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:55,079
The pilots couldn't land
between these buildings.

598
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:59,017
They're parked on the lawn outside
of the administration building.

599
01:06:00,089 --> 01:06:02,887
- How do we get there?
- We go through the underground.

600
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:05,755
It comes up outside G1.

601
01:06:09,265 --> 01:06:11,859
- I want to see the route first.
- All right, let's go.

602
01:06:12,034 --> 01:06:14,229
How long will it take?
There and back?

603
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:18,106
- Four minutes.
- lf in four minutes I'm not back...

604
01:06:18,274 --> 01:06:20,834
...my comrades will begin shooting
hostages. One a minute.

605
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:22,477
Now, don't hold me to that.

606
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:25,978
I don't know how fast you walk or
how many questions you might ask...

607
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:29,640
...or how many stops we might
have to make for security reasons.

608
01:06:32,588 --> 01:06:33,816
How far is it?

609
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:37,221
Through the underground,
I'd say about 300 meters.

610
01:06:39,195 --> 01:06:40,662
Six minutes.

611
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,058
Wait.

612
01:06:49,805 --> 01:06:51,329
The torch.

613
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:15,260
You, that side. You, next to me.
You, behind me.

614
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:52,932
If anyone makes a false move,
I will drop this grenade, understand?

615
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:47,346
Why are they so far apart?

616
01:08:47,523 --> 01:08:53,462
Look, the Air Ministry requires that
they be that far apart. That's all.

617
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:44,240
You've already used
three and a half minutes.

618
01:09:58,227 --> 01:10:01,754
Salah, it's okay. We are back.
Tell Tony.

619
01:10:16,145 --> 01:10:17,942
The route is no good.

620
01:10:19,315 --> 01:10:21,579
I cannot see your men down here,
Schreiber.

621
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:24,378
I can smell them all over the place.

622
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:27,818
So I have decided that we
should go to the helicopters by bus.

623
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:30,220
This is ridiculous.

624
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:32,223
How long do you think
you can go on?

625
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:34,828
As long as I hold the hostages.

626
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:38,622
I want a large bus here, in front
of this door, in 15 minutes.

627
01:10:40,669 --> 01:10:42,603
Thirty minutes.

628
01:10:45,941 --> 01:10:49,308
All right, 30 minutes.
But no booby traps.

629
01:10:49,778 --> 01:10:51,712
You must first give me your word...

630
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:55,407
...that no German citizen who aids in
transportation from this building...

631
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:59,520
...to your final destination shall be
in any way harmed or taken hostage.

632
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:03,123
You have my word on that.

633
01:11:08,564 --> 01:11:10,327
Damn him.

634
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:27,177
I already told you,
no more deadlines.

635
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:31,843
No, it's just me.
I'm out of cigarettes.

636
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:53,967
- I was thinking.
- What?

637
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,141
You say if Israel doesn't concede...

638
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:59,907
...you're going to kill the hostages.
- Yes.

639
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:04,451
Whether here or in Cairo,
kill them nonetheless?

640
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,553
Yes.

641
01:12:06,722 --> 01:12:09,850
Even if maybe you don't want to?

642
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:13,657
Yes.

643
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:18,797
You never would have done this
unless you thought...

644
01:12:18,967 --> 01:12:21,401
...there was a good chance
Israel would negotiate.

645
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:23,197
But now, you...

646
01:12:23,372 --> 01:12:26,830
You're dangling from
your own ultimatum.

647
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:29,910
What if you simply walked away
from it?

648
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:34,309
Just left, right now.
They've promised you safe conduct.

649
01:12:35,918 --> 01:12:38,113
Listen to me.

650
01:12:38,921 --> 01:12:42,084
Millions of people are
watching you right now.

651
01:12:42,257 --> 01:12:44,452
Watching you and me
talking in front of this door.

652
01:12:44,626 --> 01:12:46,924
It's so crazy.

653
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:52,465
They're afraid of you.
They're afraid for you too.

654
01:12:54,002 --> 01:12:55,629
Imagine what the world would feel...

655
01:12:55,804 --> 01:12:59,570
...if you suddenly spared
those nine men in there.

656
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:03,106
They're not only Israelis anymore,
they're men.

657
01:13:03,278 --> 01:13:07,146
Sons and husbands,
people we've come to know.

658
01:13:08,851 --> 01:13:12,309
Fräulein, you're asking me
to show the world that I'm a coward.

659
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:15,090
Is that it, then?

660
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:18,490
They're going to die
because of your vanity?

661
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:20,695
It is vanity when you ask me
to walk away...

662
01:13:20,863 --> 01:13:23,661
...so the world will think
I'm not a bad man after all.

663
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:28,832
No. I'm asking you
to stop the killing.

664
01:13:30,339 --> 01:13:33,831
I only want my brothers out of jail.

665
01:13:47,156 --> 01:13:50,592
I still believe we should hit
them in the underground.

666
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:54,320
That would have been fine
until they asked for the bus.

667
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:59,266
There will still be at least 10 meters
between the bus and the metal door.

668
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:00,834
Look, we agreed not to shoot...

669
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:04,029
...until at least half of the hostages
were present.

670
01:14:04,206 --> 01:14:06,674
The others are almost certain to die.

671
01:14:06,842 --> 01:14:09,106
They will be killed anyway
if you do not strike...

672
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,872
...at the first opportunity,
getting on the bus.

673
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:14,607
But certainly before
getting on the helicopter.

674
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:17,377
It is simply too great a risk
to stage a shooting match...

675
01:14:17,553 --> 01:14:19,714
...in front of the
administration building.

676
01:14:19,888 --> 01:14:22,186
They would spray the area
with automatic fire.

677
01:14:22,357 --> 01:14:25,155
That's the whole point
of the airport ambush.

678
01:14:25,327 --> 01:14:27,261
They have to walk in the open.

679
01:14:27,729 --> 01:14:31,961
But you told me, sir...

680
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:35,001
...that you had serious doubts
about the layout...

681
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:37,434
...about the lighting
at Fürstenfeldbruck.

682
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:41,166
I still have.

683
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:44,771
But at least we've got
a controlled situation.

684
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:46,910
The bus is just arriving.

685
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:51,386
Dr. Schreiber.

686
01:14:55,457 --> 01:14:57,425
I have a request.

687
01:14:57,593 --> 01:15:01,529
That I be allowed to go along
with the Arabs and the hostages.

688
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:03,392
Why?

689
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:07,097
The man listens to me, you see.

690
01:15:07,269 --> 01:15:10,329
As long as I'm there, I don't think
he will shoot anybody.

691
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:12,701
There will be other Germans
on that plane as well.

692
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:17,141
Anneliese, the plane,
if they ever get to it...

693
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:20,107
...will never get off the ground.

694
01:17:06,088 --> 01:17:08,682
Eight. My God,
there are eight of them.

695
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:12,894
We were right not to have tried
anything during the transfer.

696
01:17:24,606 --> 01:17:26,301
Faster.

697
01:18:03,278 --> 01:18:06,679
Jan, call Deputy Feldhaus at
Fürstenfeldbruck.

698
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:08,839
Tell him the action
is going to be there.

699
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:10,882
Tell him I'm sending his men back...

700
01:18:11,053 --> 01:18:13,817
...and that there are
eight terrorists. Eight.

701
01:20:32,227 --> 01:20:34,195
Look up there.

702
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:41,594
Closer. Close together.

703
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:44,295
Captains Arbes and Vacano.

704
01:20:44,472 --> 01:20:48,101
When you land at Fürstenfeldbruck,
open your doors...

705
01:20:48,276 --> 01:20:52,542
...and get away from your copters as
quickly as possible without running.

706
01:20:52,714 --> 01:20:56,844
But do not head for the 737.
Understood?

707
01:20:57,018 --> 01:20:58,542
Roger.

708
01:21:04,526 --> 01:21:06,790
There are five of them.

709
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:09,830
Five Arabs...

710
01:21:09,998 --> 01:21:12,193
...out in the open.

711
01:21:16,571 --> 01:21:20,166
Not a chance.
They're packed too close together.

712
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:13,188
You are isolated out here,
and so you men are on your own.

713
01:22:13,361 --> 01:22:15,693
If you can't find good positions
for clear shots...

714
01:22:15,864 --> 01:22:17,923
...get off the plane
as fast as you can.

715
01:23:26,634 --> 01:23:29,831
They're going to cruise north
before turning west.

716
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:31,870
We'll head straight for
Fürstenfeldbruck.

717
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:35,203
We ought to beat them by
about eight minutes, huh?

718
01:23:43,251 --> 01:23:45,685
God be with you.

719
01:23:46,054 --> 01:23:48,522
God be with you.

720
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:54,352
- Did you get your men back?
- Four minutes ago.

721
01:24:54,522 --> 01:24:56,513
They're all in position now.

722
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:26,547
Where do you think you're taking us?
We're supposed to be there by now.

723
01:25:35,396 --> 01:25:40,026
If this copter is not down in five
minutes, I'm shooting one of you.

724
01:25:43,204 --> 01:25:46,139
Pirole Two, this is Pirole One, over.

725
01:25:47,008 --> 01:25:48,407
Pirole Two here. Go ahead.

726
01:25:48,576 --> 01:25:51,602
They're threatening us.
They know we're circling.

727
01:25:51,779 --> 01:25:54,407
I'm heading straight to
Fürstenfeldbruck, full speed.

728
01:25:54,582 --> 01:25:58,348
I'll call the tower.
How's it going with you? Over.

729
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:01,956
White hat here is getting real nervous.
I was about to call you.

730
01:26:03,958 --> 01:26:05,118
Move it! Move it!

731
01:26:26,281 --> 01:26:28,374
We brought in all the lamps
we could find.

732
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:31,348
I've checked each position,
all the men can see clearly.

733
01:26:31,519 --> 01:26:33,646
And I have eight armed men
on the plane.

734
01:26:33,821 --> 01:26:40,124
But you can't do anything
with only a few men 100 yards away.

735
01:26:40,295 --> 01:26:42,820
You've got to hit them
from all sides at once.

736
01:26:42,997 --> 01:26:46,592
Get out in the open
and fire at close range.

737
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:49,236
- Where are the backup troops?
- They're not yet here.

738
01:26:49,404 --> 01:26:51,838
The press leaked the word.
All of Munich is on its way.

739
01:26:52,006 --> 01:26:55,339
There are huge bottlenecks
on Routes 2 and 471.

740
01:26:55,743 --> 01:26:57,540
That's all we need.

741
01:26:58,947 --> 01:27:00,380
This is ridiculous.

742
01:27:00,548 --> 01:27:04,211
There isn't enough room. I mean,
what can we do in here anyway?

743
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:08,253
We're laying an ambush.
Try to find a better position.

744
01:27:09,724 --> 01:27:11,385
There's no place to hide here.

745
01:27:11,826 --> 01:27:13,919
He's right, we can't
do any good here.

746
01:27:14,095 --> 01:27:17,428
Let's get out of here
and take positions outside.

747
01:28:28,202 --> 01:28:30,102
Turn out the lights.

748
01:29:04,672 --> 01:29:07,436
Halt! Get your hands up.

749
01:29:11,579 --> 01:29:13,638
What the hell are they doing?

750
01:29:13,815 --> 01:29:18,047
They are Arab terrorists.

751
01:29:18,219 --> 01:29:20,847
They are breaking their word.

752
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:22,683
That makes 11 hostages.

753
01:29:32,734 --> 01:29:33,826
Thirteen.

754
01:29:53,821 --> 01:29:55,345
They're gonna check it out.

755
01:29:55,523 --> 01:29:58,253
Radio the cockpit, tell them
two Arabs are coming aboard.

756
01:29:58,426 --> 01:30:00,986
Sir, there's no one on the plane.

757
01:30:01,462 --> 01:30:04,829
- What do you mean?
- The men have left the plane, sir.

758
01:30:04,999 --> 01:30:08,059
For God's sakes, man, get down there
and help the sharpshooters.

759
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:10,864
Be ready with automatic fire
when they get off that plane.

760
01:30:11,038 --> 01:30:12,835
Yes, sir.

761
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:17,473
Who decides when
to start shooting?

762
01:30:17,645 --> 01:30:21,012
Feldhaus. When he starts to shoot,
the others follow suit.

763
01:30:57,351 --> 01:30:59,615
We've been tricked, comrade.

764
01:31:01,055 --> 01:31:02,682
Damn it.

765
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:34,114
Fire when you're ready.

766
01:31:49,637 --> 01:31:51,104
Damn, he's still up!

767
01:32:19,634 --> 01:32:22,660
What the hell are we waiting for?
Why don't we return the fire?

768
01:32:22,837 --> 01:32:25,465
Not while there are still hostages
on those helicopters.

769
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:47,691
There he goes again!

770
01:33:02,777 --> 01:33:04,404
Come on, come on!

771
01:33:09,417 --> 01:33:10,884
Come on.

772
01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:29,069
Where are those armored vehicles?

773
01:33:29,236 --> 01:33:33,263
How will you use armor
in a situation like this?

774
01:33:41,949 --> 01:33:43,246
This is Manfred Schreiber.

775
01:33:44,318 --> 01:33:46,548
Throw down your weapons
and surrender.

776
01:33:47,054 --> 01:33:50,080
I promise your lives will be spared.

777
01:33:50,257 --> 01:33:53,420
You're completely surrounded.
There's no chance for escape.

778
01:33:54,729 --> 01:33:56,060
I repeat:

779
01:33:56,230 --> 01:33:58,721
Throw down your weapons
and step out on the runway...

780
01:33:58,899 --> 01:34:01,424
...with your hands on your heads.

781
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:45,433
Out!

782
01:35:51,779 --> 01:35:53,110
Oh, my God.

783
01:37:50,197 --> 01:37:52,665
Eleven days ago, I declared
the Olympic Games of 1972...

784
01:37:52,833 --> 01:37:55,301
...to be opened. Yesterday,
the abominable attack...

785
01:37:55,469 --> 01:38:01,430
...on Connollystrasse shattered
the serenity and saddened the world.

786
01:38:01,609 --> 01:38:05,670
Who bears the responsibility
for this crime?

787
01:38:05,846 --> 01:38:11,614
First of all, the terrorist organization
that thinks hatred and murder...

788
01:38:11,785 --> 01:38:14,686
...can be methods
of a political struggle.

789
01:38:14,855 --> 01:38:19,554
But in addition, there are countries
that do not stop these men...

790
01:38:19,727 --> 01:38:22,560
...from perpetrating such acts.

791
01:38:22,730 --> 01:38:25,824
The Olympic idea lives on.

792
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:30,835
Our commitment to it
is more powerful than ever.

793
01:38:31,739 --> 01:38:34,537
In the name of the
German Federal Republic...

794
01:38:34,708 --> 01:38:38,439
...I address this appeal
to all the peoples of the world.

795
01:38:38,612 --> 01:38:41,410
Help us overcome hatred.

796
01:38:41,582 --> 01:38:45,643
Help us pave the way
for reconciliation.

797
01:38:45,819 --> 01:38:47,719
Help us.

798
01:38:49,456 --> 01:38:52,687
Fifty-three days later,
the three surviving Arab terrorists...

799
01:38:52,860 --> 01:38:56,261
...were released from a Munich jail
in exchange for 17 passengers...

800
01:38:56,430 --> 01:38:58,864
...on a German airliner
hijacked by members...

801
01:38:59,033 --> 01:39:01,593
...of the Black September
organization.

802
01:39:01,769 --> 01:39:06,604
On their arrival in Tripoli, they were
accorded a hero's welcome.
