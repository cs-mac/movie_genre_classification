1
00:00:16,487 --> 00:00:17,410
What will it be?

2
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,980
Fill it up.

3
00:00:31,385 --> 00:00:33,580
Welcome aboard. I'm Jang Jin-pyo.

4
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:38,046
$50 please.

5
00:00:38,047 --> 00:00:44,353
What's with the attitude?
Hey, you, come here!

6
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:53,022
He's really got an attitude!
Welcome!

7
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:02,513
Hello, pretty ladies. Fill it up?

8
00:01:04,095 --> 00:01:07,050
You're so pretty.

9
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,413
What do you want for Christmas?

10
00:01:13,885 --> 00:01:19,022
Nothing...I just want to see Joon-young.

11
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,160
You still haven't come to your senses.

12
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,091
I said no.

13
00:01:27,092 --> 00:01:29,990
Can't I see just Joon-young alone?

14
00:01:29,993 --> 00:01:33,053
No. My answer is no.

15
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,413
All done.

16
00:02:03,895 --> 00:02:06,825
We're going to have a
party here this Christmas?

17
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:09,685
Then you have to let me hear your song.

18
00:02:09,692 --> 00:02:12,813
Don't worry. Just knit the other mitten.

19
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,413
Promise.

20
00:02:15,795 --> 00:02:19,122
Okay. Promise!

21
00:02:58,855 --> 00:03:03,422
Oh Hyung... how's everything?

22
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,090
Have you heard from Hae-in yet?

23
00:03:06,091 --> 00:03:10,980
No, but how are you doing?

24
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:13,985
When are you coming for a visit?

25
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,957
On Christmas Eve.

26
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,289
Really? Really?
eh, Mommy's here.

27
00:03:28,101 --> 00:03:29,990
What are you doing?

28
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,180
There's something I want to say to you,

29
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,413
so I wrote it on the window.

30
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,090
Welcome.

31
00:03:58,289 --> 00:03:59,389
Isn't Jin-pyo here?

32
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,380
No. How much?

33
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,380
Fill it up.

34
00:04:05,905 --> 00:04:07,990
Okay.

35
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,050
Is there another one like you?

36
00:04:16,086 --> 00:04:19,005
I told you, you can't
find another one like me.

37
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,990
$80 please.

38
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,090
Excuse me.

39
00:04:50,052 --> 00:04:54,413
I forgot my wallet. Get it from Jin-pyo.

40
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,046
I can't do that.

41
00:04:57,047 --> 00:05:01,023
Don't you know Jin-pyo? I'm his friend.

42
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:03,912
I'm sure the girls have money.

43
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,122
How can I ask a girl to pay?

44
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,091
Boss!

45
00:05:11,003 --> 00:05:13,513
You sure are inflexible.

46
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,089
All right!

47
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:24,913
Sun-ah.

48
00:05:24,914 --> 00:05:26,835
What?

49
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,960
Hey, Lee Gun-woo!

50
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,380
Hello.

51
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:34,990
You're already getting into trouble

52
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,090
now that school's out?

53
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,480
Who are they?

54
00:05:44,047 --> 00:05:45,910
My older sisters.

55
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:49,047
Aigoo~ you like older sisters?
You'll be a high school senior soon.

56
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,990
Come to your senses, boy!

57
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:54,957
$20.

58
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,885
Okay.

59
00:05:56,885 --> 00:05:58,160
$20.

60
00:05:58,285 --> 00:06:03,860
A senior in high school?
You're a high school student??

61
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:06,960
Unbelievable!

62
00:06:06,964 --> 00:06:12,023
I'm sorry, older sisters.

63
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:21,022
Hey noona, $80?

64
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,013
Thank you.

65
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,990
Goodbye.

66
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,022
Just study hard, kid!

67
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,413
Keep up the good work!

68
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,413
Come again!

69
00:07:10,835 --> 00:07:13,760
Lee Gun-woo, what are you doing here?

70
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,847
You have such bad timing.

71
00:07:16,985 --> 00:07:20,960
I brought some older girls,
but my cover was blown!

72
00:07:20,985 --> 00:07:23,890
Those hot older girls?
Where are they?

73
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:27,960
They slapped me in the face
and then dumped me.

74
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,122
Those were some hot girls!

75
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,990
I was going to break up with her anyway.

76
00:07:37,885 --> 00:07:39,885
What's with him?

77
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,893
I don't know. He never talks
about his personal life.

78
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:45,957
When do you get off work?
Let's go to the studio.

79
00:07:45,957 --> 00:07:48,380
I'll be off soon.
Wait for me.

80
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:05,905
Please tell me. Where's the house?

81
00:08:05,905 --> 00:08:07,956
I don't know.

82
00:08:08,256 --> 00:08:11,347
But Lily told me she saw
you talking to Joon-young.

83
00:08:11,547 --> 00:08:13,235
That's not true.

84
00:08:13,557 --> 00:08:16,050
I'm going nto run away to
Seoul if you don't tell me.

85
00:08:16,051 --> 00:08:21,289
Do whatever you want.

86
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,380
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, and
I have something to give him.

87
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,936
Then just behave yourself.
He'll be here tomorrow.

88
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,957
Really? What time?

89
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,946
I don't know!

90
00:08:36,947 --> 00:08:38,989
Thank you, Oppa!

91
00:08:40,885 --> 00:08:43,960
That hopelessly idiotic girl!

92
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:58,047
Welcome!

93
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:02,380
Merry Christmas!

94
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,413
Thank you for the tree!

95
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,890
Isn't he cute?

96
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,413
He's not bad.

97
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,713
He's a big spender, and he's very popular.

98
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,593
Really?

99
00:09:22,593 --> 00:09:24,090
Really.

100
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:30,580
Willie, this is Audrey.

101
00:09:31,046 --> 00:09:33,513
Nice to meet you. I'm Willie.

102
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,956
Really? Thank you, thank you!

103
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,047
You're very handsome.

104
00:09:50,046 --> 00:09:51,960
I'm blushing!

105
00:09:54,047 --> 00:09:56,936
Shall we go to the Post Exchange with them

106
00:09:56,936 --> 00:09:58,905
and get something to eat?

107
00:09:58,905 --> 00:10:01,957
Shall we?

108
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:12,090
Hae-in, let's go grocery shopping.

109
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,990
I just want to stay home.

110
00:10:14,992 --> 00:10:18,380
We'll go by car. Some fresh air
will do you good.

111
00:10:18,955 --> 00:10:20,237
I'm tired.

112
00:10:20,237 --> 00:10:25,380
You are? Well, I'll be back soon then.

113
00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:32,380
Let's go.

114
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,860
Where to?

115
00:11:07,861 --> 00:11:09,957
To Seoul Station.

116
00:11:09,957 --> 00:11:11,957
All right.

117
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,089
TO HAE-IN

118
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,257
What's that?

119
00:11:47,813 --> 00:11:49,092
He sure is cold!

120
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,113
Hi, friend.

121
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,960
Why are you eating when
there'll be food at the party?

122
00:11:58,963 --> 00:12:04,380
Don't worry. I could still eat a horse.

123
00:12:10,905 --> 00:12:14,990
Why did he have to come while I'm eating?

124
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:53,090
I want to dance with some
hot girls at the party!

125
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,046
Don't worry.

126
00:12:56,046 --> 00:12:58,905
I convinced some flight attendants to come.

127
00:12:58,905 --> 00:13:00,850
Really?

128
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,990
You're the best!

129
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:08,036
Hey! Give me the mitten.

130
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,513
I'm sorry. Was it yours?

131
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,905
Why wear this instead of your other ones?

132
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,380
What weird taste in fashion!

133
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,380
You don't have to look at me like that...

134
00:13:24,046 --> 00:13:27,380
He said he was sorry.

135
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:31,413
Buy a new one, or have it cleaned.

136
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:36,380
Don't ruin such a nice day.

137
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,413
It's okay. Take it.

138
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,090
When do you get off work?

139
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,513
Are you nuts?

140
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:56,989
Don't ruin such a nice day.

141
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,412
Hey, stop!

142
00:14:03,905 --> 00:14:07,413
I'm going to get fired if you fight!

143
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,923
Let go!

144
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,090
Hey!

145
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,090
Gun-woo!

146
00:14:21,046 --> 00:14:25,413
You have to calm down! Gun-woo!

147
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,047
Gun-woo!

148
00:14:28,547 --> 00:14:30,913
He can't control his temper!

149
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,413
There goes the party with the hot girls!

150
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,380
Welcome!

151
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:06,350
Show me your ticket.
I'll direct you to your seat.

152
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,885
You can't park here.

153
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,380
Hey!

154
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:38,413
This is your seat.

155
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:31,050
We have to finish what we started.

156
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,050
Satisfied?

157
00:16:39,789 --> 00:16:43,050
We have to finish what we started!

158
00:16:44,113 --> 00:16:46,413
You have to buy your ticket!

159
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,513
How much is it? There!

160
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,090
Why, you!

161
00:16:54,122 --> 00:16:56,990
Let go of me!

162
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,413
Hey!

163
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:09,413
Joon-young!

164
00:20:12,101 --> 00:20:13,513
What are you doing here?

165
00:20:13,514 --> 00:20:16,090
I've been waiting for you since morning!

166
00:20:16,101 --> 00:20:20,380
I've been out here in the
cold waiting for you!

167
00:20:21,122 --> 00:20:24,593
You've been here since morning?
Have you seen Hae-in?

168
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,380
Hae-in? Why?

169
00:20:28,822 --> 00:20:30,905
Have you heard any news about her?

170
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,990
What news could there possibly be?

171
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,413
Let's go eat something.

172
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,289
I have to go.

173
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:47,512
Let's go!

174
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,513
Isn't it pretty?

175
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,180
What is it?

176
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:05,413
I folded 1000 cranes wishing
I could see you again.

177
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:11,412
Put in on your desk and think
of me whenever you see it.

178
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:14,413
Thanks...

179
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:19,380
It looks yummy! Enjoy.

180
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,990
Joon-young.

181
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:12,413
Are you waiting for Hae-in?

182
00:22:13,047 --> 00:22:14,160
Yes.

183
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,910
She didn't come.

184
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,122
I've been at the station since morning.

185
00:22:18,123 --> 00:22:21,912
She still might come. Let's go.

186
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:24,513
I'm not finished eating.

187
00:22:25,013 --> 00:22:27,090
Then finish eating. I have to go.

188
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,090
You're being so cruel.

189
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,460
I didn't even eat because
I was waiting for you,

190
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:34,090
and you want to leave now?

191
00:22:34,101 --> 00:22:37,413
Sorry. See you later.

192
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,513
Suh Joon-young!

193
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,047
Shouldn't you call home?

194
00:23:53,047 --> 00:23:54,290
My parents will be so upset

195
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:57,280
When they find out I was hurt.

196
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,413
I'm all right as long as you're here.

197
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:05,949
Cha Hwa-jung?

198
00:24:05,949 --> 00:24:06,490
Yes?

199
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:09,910
Your injury's not serious.

200
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:14,352
But I'm in pain.

201
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:18,613
Don't worry. You just strained your muscles.

202
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:23,522
It really hurts.

203
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,990
Aren't you getting in?

204
00:24:43,992 --> 00:24:45,905
Go ahead. I have to go somewhere.

205
00:24:45,905 --> 00:24:47,956
You want me go to alone?

206
00:24:47,956 --> 00:24:50,905
Sir, drive her to the beauty salon.

207
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,885
Sure.

208
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:01,413
Hey, Suh Joon-young!

209
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:06,285
Come again!

210
00:26:06,813 --> 00:26:07,956
Hae-in!

211
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,960
Oppa!

212
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,413
Are you alone? Where's Joon-young?

213
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,615
Isn't he inside?

214
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:25,380
He said he was coming. Didn't you see him?

215
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:30,957
Come here for a second.

216
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,413
Joon-young doesn't live here anymore.

217
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,047
What?

218
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,113
He got into big trouble and ended up

219
00:26:40,113 --> 00:26:43,413
at the police station after you left.

220
00:26:43,905 --> 00:26:46,513
So Mommy sent him to live with his father.

221
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,050
Where does he live?

222
00:26:49,112 --> 00:26:52,022
How dare you come back here!

223
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:54,513
Mommy!

224
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:58,050
How dare you show your face here!

225
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:00,960
Do you want to see your aunt behind bars?

226
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,089
Joon-young's not here. Leave.

227
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:09,050
Go back inside!

228
00:27:09,051 --> 00:27:12,990
Mommy.

229
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:21,380
Hae-in, take care. I'm going inside.

230
00:28:01,089 --> 00:28:03,480
Hae-in!

231
00:28:03,905 --> 00:28:06,380
Hwa-jung.

232
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,845
Here's your ticket.

233
00:28:14,923 --> 00:28:17,890
You really don't know where Joon-young is?

234
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:22,113
No, I don't. You'd better go

235
00:28:22,113 --> 00:28:25,380
before you miss the last train.

236
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:33,380
This is my address.

237
00:28:33,936 --> 00:28:36,047
Will you give it to Joon-young?

238
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,380
Okay. Go.

239
00:28:39,047 --> 00:28:41,479
Thanks. See you again.

240
00:30:03,047 --> 00:30:04,960
Sir, when did the train leave?

241
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,413
The last train left a while ago.

242
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,047
Joon-young.

243
00:31:15,047 --> 00:31:17,090
Oh Hyung.

244
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:19,090
Did you see Hae-in?

245
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:20,960
No.

246
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,905
But she was here looking for you.

247
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:27,090
When? Where is she?

248
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:28,913
She left.

249
00:31:28,913 --> 00:31:31,885
Mommy told her you weren't here,

250
00:31:31,885 --> 00:31:35,413
and she left in tears.

251
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:38,913
I didn't have a chance to ask her

252
00:31:38,913 --> 00:31:43,413
where she lives because
Mommy was so upset.

253
00:32:23,245 --> 00:32:24,455
Willie!

254
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:28,025
Don't worry. She'll be back soon.

255
00:32:28,025 --> 00:32:30,678
Go back inside. I ruined the party.

256
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:33,577
It's all right.

257
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:36,578
Look!

258
00:32:38,978 --> 00:32:40,578
Hae-in!

259
00:32:44,245 --> 00:32:48,211
What happened to you?
Where did you go?

260
00:32:48,857 --> 00:32:50,245
I'm sorry, Aunt.

261
00:32:52,266 --> 00:32:56,515
You went to see Joon-young, didn't you?

262
00:32:58,255 --> 00:33:01,678
Are you crazy? How could you go there?

263
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:04,125
Audrey.

264
00:33:06,787 --> 00:33:11,854
I can't see Joon-young anymore.

265
00:33:12,578 --> 00:33:15,215
I don't think I can see him again.

266
00:33:16,454 --> 00:33:18,645
What?

267
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:03,245
Move! You're splashing.

268
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:05,212
I was here first!

269
00:34:05,212 --> 00:34:08,678
How long does it take you to wash your face?

270
00:34:09,122 --> 00:34:12,278
You should go polish your head!

271
00:34:13,054 --> 00:34:15,122
Polish my head? Unbelievable!

272
00:34:15,122 --> 00:34:21,645
Why wash your face when it doesn't help you?

273
00:34:23,212 --> 00:34:26,155
Why did you hit me?

274
00:34:27,245 --> 00:34:29,678
Be quiet! Why are you fighting?

275
00:34:30,145 --> 00:34:33,545
Can't you be more sensitive?

276
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,150
I heard Hae-in was here.

277
00:34:42,155 --> 00:34:46,578
Go back to Seoul after you finish eating.

278
00:34:48,245 --> 00:34:52,215
Why are you intent on sending me back?

279
00:34:53,215 --> 00:34:56,678
Did you find a foreign boyfriend?

280
00:35:01,245 --> 00:35:05,121
Yes, so go back to your father,

281
00:35:05,121 --> 00:35:07,211
and don't get into trouble.

282
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:11,125
Don't interfere in my life anymore.

283
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:16,545
You don't have the right, Mom.

284
00:35:19,215 --> 00:35:22,515
I don't want to see you anymore. Go.

285
00:35:23,215 --> 00:35:27,015
Don't worry! I'll never set foot

286
00:35:27,015 --> 00:35:30,545
in this miserable house again!

287
00:35:34,122 --> 00:35:36,578
Joon-young! Joon-Young!
What happened?

288
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,645
Mommy!

289
00:35:48,245 --> 00:35:50,215
Are you all right?

290
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:51,545
Mommy!

291
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,050
Joon-young!

292
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:57,678
Let him go. Don't call him back.

293
00:35:58,254 --> 00:36:00,054
Mommy!

294
00:36:00,278 --> 00:36:05,454
Joon-young!

295
00:36:31,266 --> 00:36:33,212
Leave us alone.

296
00:36:33,213 --> 00:36:35,645
Okay, Mommy.

297
00:36:39,088 --> 00:36:42,155
I'm advising that you be hospitalized.

298
00:36:42,157 --> 00:36:45,200
I know what I have.

299
00:36:45,215 --> 00:36:48,070
I'm the doctor.

300
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:52,545
You told me rest won't get me well.

301
00:36:54,215 --> 00:36:58,450
I don't need to live longer.

302
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,212
Take your medicine, and get
to a hospital right away

303
00:37:04,212 --> 00:37:06,175
if you don't feel well.

304
00:37:06,175 --> 00:37:11,545
And absolutely no smoking or drinking.

305
00:37:12,215 --> 00:37:16,545
I'd rather die than live like a corpse.

306
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:43,125
Your English tutor will be here soon.

307
00:37:43,175 --> 00:37:45,212
English, Japanese, French, horseback riding,

308
00:37:45,212 --> 00:37:48,070
fencing and all the other lessons...

309
00:37:48,095 --> 00:37:51,125
They're a waste of time.

310
00:37:51,165 --> 00:37:53,121
You have it too good.

311
00:37:53,135 --> 00:37:57,145
A lot of people with
they were in your shoes.

312
00:37:59,989 --> 00:38:03,122
I hired a good tutor for you,
so pay attention.

313
00:38:04,122 --> 00:38:06,245
Yes, come in.

314
00:39:32,255 --> 00:39:36,454
He looks familiar.

315
00:39:38,178 --> 00:39:39,454
He's quite handsome.

316
00:39:39,454 --> 00:39:41,122
Give it to me.

317
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:43,545
Who is he?

318
00:39:44,445 --> 00:39:47,578
Is he... someone you like?

319
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:55,545
Do you know he likes you too?

320
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:21,645
Sis, my English tutor...

321
00:40:37,211 --> 00:40:39,278
Gun-woo.

322
00:40:39,299 --> 00:40:42,212
Did manager Oh leave?

323
00:40:43,255 --> 00:40:46,122
You must've been shocked.

324
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:50,412
I feel betrayed. How long has it been?

325
00:40:50,412 --> 00:40:52,212
It's been a while.

326
00:40:52,212 --> 00:40:57,278
Since he was my tutor when I
was in junior high.

327
00:40:58,255 --> 00:41:01,070
So your crush on him developed into love?

328
00:41:01,075 --> 00:41:04,045
Don't tease me.

329
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:12,205
Could Manager Oh make you happy?

330
00:41:13,278 --> 00:41:16,321
His top priority is work, just like Dad.

331
00:41:16,321 --> 00:41:20,545
Sang-jin is more thougthful than he appears.

332
00:41:22,201 --> 00:41:26,454
You're already defending him?

333
00:41:27,245 --> 00:41:30,557
You should go and study
with your English tutor.

334
00:41:31,212 --> 00:41:34,121
You know that I'm on your side, don't you?

335
00:41:34,121 --> 00:41:36,545
I trust you.

336
00:41:59,202 --> 00:42:03,545
Joon-young.

337
00:42:12,245 --> 00:42:16,278
Try it. Their soup's famous.

338
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,122
Do you want a drink?

339
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:28,545
No.

340
00:42:30,245 --> 00:42:38,245
I thought you went back to your mother.

341
00:42:38,245 --> 00:42:44,355
I lived without you for ten years.

342
00:42:44,355 --> 00:42:49,578
But since you came back into my life,

343
00:42:49,578 --> 00:42:53,070
I can't live without you.

344
00:42:53,155 --> 00:42:55,605
I sleep, but feel like I haven't slept.

345
00:42:55,605 --> 00:43:00,778
I eat, but feel like I haven't eaten.

346
00:43:07,345 --> 00:43:12,478
I wanted you to come live with me

347
00:43:12,478 --> 00:43:17,680
as soon as I could afford a place for us.

348
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:24,025
Yet here I am, middle-aged, and...

349
00:43:24,025 --> 00:43:28,545
I still haven't accomplished that goal!

350
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:38,255
Drink slowly.

351
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:46,074
Now that you're here, I think I can do it.

352
00:43:46,075 --> 00:43:55,278
I think I can play the saxophone again.

353
00:43:58,245 --> 00:44:02,077
I haven't been able to play it

354
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:06,240
because I've choked every time I've tried.

355
00:44:06,245 --> 00:44:10,570
I thought of how I left you with your mother...

356
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:17,215
But now I feel like I can do anything.

357
00:44:17,215 --> 00:44:23,070
I can be a decent human being!

358
00:45:18,454 --> 00:45:20,255
You two do look alike.

359
00:45:20,256 --> 00:45:22,150
Really?

360
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:25,078
But your son's more handsome!

361
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:29,545
You sure have a good son!

362
00:45:30,255 --> 00:45:32,121
Make yourself at home.

363
00:45:32,125 --> 00:45:34,122
and let me know if there's
anything I can do for you.

364
00:45:34,125 --> 00:45:38,087
I'm managing the money your mom gave us.

365
00:45:38,155 --> 00:45:40,578
Get us some water.

366
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:43,545
Okay.

367
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:50,255
She can be ditzy, but she has a good heart.

368
00:45:50,255 --> 00:45:52,121
Try to get along with her.

369
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:53,858
Okay.

370
00:45:53,858 --> 00:45:57,515
I want you to quit your job at
the gas station.

371
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:04,545
You're a senior now, so I want you to study.

372
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:08,545
I'll give you an allowance.

373
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:18,212
Who is it?

374
00:46:19,255 --> 00:46:25,578
Willie! What are you doing here?

375
00:46:33,125 --> 00:46:34,287
Willie!

376
00:46:34,295 --> 00:46:38,645
Do you want to go for a drive?

377
00:46:42,102 --> 00:46:47,545
Get up. Willie wants to take us for a drive.

378
00:46:48,288 --> 00:46:50,122
You go.

379
00:46:50,255 --> 00:46:58,578
There you go again!
Let's get some fresh air.

380
00:46:59,225 --> 00:47:03,545
Come on! Get up!

381
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:08,545
Change your clothes, and let's go out.

382
00:47:12,255 --> 00:47:15,215
You're opening a gallery?

383
00:47:15,215 --> 00:47:17,221
I'm sorry I can't attend the opening.

384
00:47:17,222 --> 00:47:20,578
It's all right. Thanks for the thought.

385
00:47:21,278 --> 00:47:23,545
Are you coming from the gym?

386
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:27,010
It's been a long time.

387
00:47:27,125 --> 00:47:29,125
She's going abroad to study.

388
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:31,212
You're leaving before you graduate?

389
00:47:31,212 --> 00:47:33,211
My dad opened a studio there,

390
00:47:33,211 --> 00:47:36,070
so I'm going sooner than expected.

391
00:47:36,095 --> 00:47:37,155
Congratulations.

392
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:40,050
Let's go out. My treat.

393
00:47:40,215 --> 00:47:47,212
I have plans. You should take my sister.

394
00:47:48,255 --> 00:47:50,678
Should I beat him up?

395
00:47:51,255 --> 00:47:55,545
Go upstairs.

396
00:47:59,236 --> 00:48:02,070
Can't you knock?

397
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:05,545
We skinny-dipped as kids!

398
00:48:11,245 --> 00:48:15,578
What's the matter?
We skinny-dipped as kids.

399
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:31,080
You gave me my first kiss.
I'll date up a storm like you.

400
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,875
But I wanted my first kiss to be with you.

401
00:48:33,875 --> 00:48:37,122
What should I do?
You weren't my first kiss.

402
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:40,778
I don't care because your last kiss
will be with me.

403
00:48:54,255 --> 00:48:57,122
Did you get a new one? It's cool!

404
00:48:57,155 --> 00:48:59,054
Is the jerk here?

405
00:49:00,077 --> 00:49:01,345
But he's quitting.

406
00:49:01,345 --> 00:49:04,212
I think he's running away
because he's scared of you.

407
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06,787
I'm going to finish what I started!

408
00:49:06,878 --> 00:49:09,745
Be careful! He might just knock you out.

409
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:12,578
What?

410
00:49:15,254 --> 00:49:17,577
Welcome!

411
00:49:28,202 --> 00:49:30,050
How much?

412
00:49:30,055 --> 00:49:31,212
Card.

413
00:49:31,212 --> 00:49:35,211
Card? You speak Korean well.

414
00:49:36,354 --> 00:49:39,211
Aren't you glad we went out?

415
00:49:40,212 --> 00:49:42,070
Aren't you hungry?

416
00:49:42,085 --> 00:49:45,578
I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.

417
00:50:00,245 --> 00:50:03,078
Nice to see you.

418
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:06,425
We have to finish it once and for all.

419
00:50:06,425 --> 00:50:10,578
Shall we do it here or somewhere else?

420
00:50:31,755 --> 00:50:33,000
Hey!

421
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Gun-woo's met his match!

422
00:50:50,878 --> 00:50:52,000
Hey!

423
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,578
Get off!

424
00:53:16,545 --> 00:53:19,000
You're all right.

425
00:53:21,254 --> 00:53:25,545
Let's be friends.

426
00:53:30,577 --> 00:53:32,212
I'll give it some thought.

427
00:53:32,212 --> 00:53:37,545
You must know by now, don't you?

428
00:53:38,255 --> 00:53:42,545
I'm relentless. I always finish what I start.

429
00:54:02,755 --> 00:54:04,155
Hae-in!

430
00:54:04,188 --> 00:54:06,545
Come on! Let's sing

431
00:54:21,255 --> 00:54:23,578
You sang so well!

432
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:26,000
Be careful.

433
00:54:28,215 --> 00:54:31,545
I had so much fun!

434
00:54:31,545 --> 00:54:33,345
The drive by the river was great,

435
00:54:33,345 --> 00:54:35,121
and singing was so much fun!

436
00:54:35,125 --> 00:54:37,787
Wasn't it fun?

437
00:54:37,787 --> 00:54:39,000
Did you have fun?

438
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:41,878
Yes, so much fun!

439
00:54:42,077 --> 00:54:43,210
Let's come again.

440
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:46,050
Really? Promise!

441
00:54:51,255 --> 00:54:54,010
Is this Rosa?

442
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:57,020
Father!

443
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:00,200
It's been so long!

444
00:55:03,287 --> 00:55:06,454
Is this little Juliana?

445
00:55:06,455 --> 00:55:08,254
Yes, it is.

446
00:55:08,254 --> 00:55:12,578
Hae-in, you remember Father John, don't you?

447
00:55:13,254 --> 00:55:16,541
Hello, Father. How have you been?

448
00:55:17,255 --> 00:55:19,678
Do you still play the piano?

449
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:22,124
Sure!

450
00:55:22,125 --> 00:55:26,212
Do you live nearby?
My church is in the area.

451
00:55:26,212 --> 00:55:28,245
That's great!

452
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:31,578
I'm really glad I ran into you.

453
00:55:33,545 --> 00:55:35,212
Who's he?

454
00:55:35,315 --> 00:55:38,254
I'm her boyfriend. Nice to meet you.

455
00:55:38,275 --> 00:55:40,678
Nice to meet you.

456
00:55:42,245 --> 00:55:48,545
He's handsome. You two make a nice couple.

457
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:52,157
Father, you're embarrassing me.

458
00:55:52,157 --> 00:55:55,187
Then don't stand so close to him.

459
00:55:56,254 --> 00:55:58,645
Oh, Father!

460
00:55:59,075 --> 00:56:02,212
You grew into a fine young lady.

461
00:56:02,215 --> 00:56:05,678
God must've created Eve with you in mind.

462
00:56:21,245 --> 00:56:25,155
This is the marketing plan for Q-one's
launch in May.

463
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:27,255
We're accepting presentations from
local companies

464
00:56:27,255 --> 00:56:31,545
as well as Japanese ones.

465
00:56:32,298 --> 00:56:34,545
Good job.

466
00:56:43,287 --> 00:56:47,245
I need your permisson on another matter.

467
00:56:47,925 --> 00:56:50,215
What is it?

468
00:56:50,216 --> 00:56:54,550
Su-ji and I like each other.

469
00:56:54,555 --> 00:56:58,578
Give us your permission to date.

470
00:57:05,254 --> 00:57:08,515
Here, let me pour you a drink.

471
00:57:11,157 --> 00:57:13,125
I thought all you cared about was work.

472
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:16,515
You never cease to amaze me.

473
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:21,212
Su-ji had a crush on him since junior high.

474
00:57:21,212 --> 00:57:25,641
It's been 10 secretive years!

475
00:57:26,215 --> 00:57:30,578
So you've known my family for over 10 years.

476
00:57:31,122 --> 00:57:32,156
Yes, sir.

477
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:36,121
It's only natural for two young people

478
00:57:36,121 --> 00:57:40,080
to fall for each other over the years.

479
00:57:40,122 --> 00:57:43,578
Thank you, sir!

480
00:58:33,254 --> 00:58:36,254
Let's eat.

481
00:58:38,215 --> 00:58:41,278
My pretty Hae-in. You're eating well.

482
00:58:42,155 --> 00:58:45,745
You're so adorable!

483
00:58:46,254 --> 00:58:48,570
Audrey.

484
00:58:52,215 --> 00:58:54,345
It's so good!

485
00:58:58,245 --> 00:59:00,515
It's yummy!

486
00:59:01,125 --> 00:59:07,845
How long have you knowns Father John?

487
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:11,125
Since I was about this small.

488
00:59:11,254 --> 00:59:16,254
You two seemed close. I'm jealous.

489
00:59:17,007 --> 00:59:22,758
Nonsense! He's like a father to me.

490
00:59:34,245 --> 00:59:37,515
Oh, my! Willie says he loves me.

491
00:59:41,545 --> 00:59:44,578
Here are your noodles.

492
00:59:46,254 --> 00:59:48,545
Thank you.

493
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,121
Enjoy.

494
00:59:53,125 --> 00:59:56,212
Your favorite noodle

495
00:59:57,025 --> 00:59:59,121
Egg.

496
00:59:59,121 --> 01:00:01,040
You're weird.

497
01:00:01,125 --> 01:00:04,578
I don't like the whites because they're slimy.

498
01:00:05,564 --> 01:00:07,254
You're the werid one.

499
01:00:07,255 --> 01:00:12,545
I don't like the yolks because they're dry.

500
01:00:13,925 --> 01:00:15,545
This is good.

501
01:00:18,458 --> 01:00:21,101
Why aren't you eating?

502
01:00:21,101 --> 01:00:23,145
Go ahead. It's good.

503
