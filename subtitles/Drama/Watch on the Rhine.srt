any more errands for me to do.

168

will lead you back to Europe again?

You can't give up that dream,
can you, Teck?

into their good graces again?

That they'll let you come back and play?
You ought to stay away from them.

- You have political convictions?
- I don't know what I have.

But I've never liked Nazis
and you should have had enough of them.

195

They seem to have had enough of you.

They're smarter than you are
and it's time you let them alone.

to say something to me.

What is it?

199

That you ought not to be seen
at the German Embassy.

200
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:05,362
And that it's insane to go on
playing poker there with only $85 left.

201

they'd like your not being able to pay up.

What? Oh, all the Randolphs
were good-looking.

306
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:33,855
- No matter what else they weren't.
- I reckon men find her most attractive.

307
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:37,760
Don't you think so, Fanny? Don't you think
she is most attractive to men?

308
00:18:37,933 --> 00:18:40,094
I'm sure I don't know. I'm not a man.

309
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:43,363
Of course, Jennie Randolph
wanted her to marry nobility.

310
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:47,168
It was a brilliant wedding.
Remember, Fanny, in Paris?

311
00:18:47,342 --> 00:18:50,505
Now, doesn't it seem strange
that she's back here?

312
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:55,173
And the circle is completed, as they say,
right in your house and...

313
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,443
What circle? What are you talking about?

314
00:18:57,619 --> 00:19:00,087
Candy. I'll buy messy candy.

315
00:19:00,255 --> 00:19:03,281
That's what my grandchildren would like.
Messy candy.

316
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,858
If you'd had grandchildren, Mellie,
heaven forbid...

317
00:19:06,028 --> 00:19:09,464
...they'd have been children who never ate
between meals, who were sickly.

318
00:19:09,631 --> 00:19:12,998
All your family were sickly.
I think you've made up a good deal of it.

319
00:19:13,168 --> 00:19:16,103
Licorice. That's what I'll buy.

320

MELLIE: Really, Fanny,
you've wasted all afternoon for me.

321
00:19:22,544 --> 00:19:24,512
Now it's too late to try on my dresses.

322
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,946
Oh, do be careful of the candy, Mellie.
Close up the box.

323
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:34,154
Acting like a 6-year-old
over Sara's homecoming.

324
00:19:34,323 --> 00:19:37,656
It might be better if you spent your time
worrying a little about David.

It isn't that I believe everything that Cora
says, but she says everybody is talking.

326
00:19:42,531 --> 00:19:45,932
Especially after he took her
to the colonel's dinner party. People said...

327
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:49,696
What are you chattering about?
You must get new upper teeth, Mellie.

328
00:19:49,872 --> 00:19:52,067
Nobody can understand a word
you say anymore.

329
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:55,802
- You used to have lovely teeth.
- You can't understand me.

330
00:19:55,978 --> 00:19:59,414
You can't even understand that all
Washington's talking about your son...

331
00:19:59,581 --> 00:20:02,948
...and the Countess de Brancovis.
Everybody says it's serious too.

332
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,779
Not just, you know.

333
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:08,286
If it was just, you know,
people would gossip a little and then stop.

334
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:12,120
What is "just you know"? Mellie,
you're old enough to say what you mean.

335
00:20:13,595 --> 00:20:17,258
Let me off at the next block.
I promised to fetch David.

336
00:20:17,432 --> 00:20:20,333
Take these things home for me, darling,
and thanks for the car.

337

Don't let them bump around.

And be very careful when you take them out
and give them to Joseph himself.

Cyrus, my German son-in-law

Find him something really good, Cyrus.
How's Marjorie?

350

Looking her age, Fanny,
which you never do. It's remarkable.

Not very remarkable.
I was a great beauty. You remember, Cyrus.

352

We always remember. When Joshua
snapped you up, I was heartbroken.

353
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:40,107
All of Washington was heartbroken.
Most of it. Anyway...

354
00:21:40,282 --> 00:21:43,979
Goodbye, Cyrus. And thanks for arranging
the fine job for my son-in-law.

Fanny, what kind of engineer is he?

00:21:46,755 --> 00:21:49,747
What kind? Any kind.
What does Cyrus mean?

There are kinds of engineers.

Civil, mining, electrical.
He used to work for Dornier.

359
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,663
- I guess that would make him...
- He's all kinds of an engineer, I'm sure.

360
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:02,201
Goodbye, Cyrus.
Bring Marjorie for dinner.

I hope you haven't
been urging them to stay.

You invited them, Mama.
They're your guests.

Oh, they were mine. But that was before
you became enamored of Marthe.

She was such as pretty young girl.

- Naturally, or you wouldn't be so ardent.

00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:53,877
I don't know why I say that.
You were ardent with that Carter girl.

00:22:54,056 --> 00:22:55,921
And you couldn't
have thought her pretty.

Oh, look here, David.
What is going on between you and Marthe?

I don't like that question, Mama.

at hiding whatever there is to hide.

You know, I wonder

is not enough.

On that day, I see 27 men murdered
in a Nazi street fight.

"I must make my stand.
I can do nothing else.

00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:45,322
...allows of no rats, rodents or crawlers,
and is most sanitary.

759
00:45:45,726 --> 00:45:48,160
Papa likes to know
how each thing is put together.

760
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:50,489
And he is so fond of being clean.

761
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:54,794
I am a hero to my children.
It bores everybody but me.

762
00:45:54,968 --> 00:45:58,335
Yes, it is a fine bathroom.
Better than in Brussels, eh?

763
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:01,167
Well, trapping the mice there
was most interesting.

764
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:05,300
Goodness. And now you must have
your rest before lunch.

765
00:46:14,087 --> 00:46:18,114
I hear they've arrived.
Have you met them?

766
00:46:18,292 --> 00:46:20,283
What has David told you
about Herr Muller?

767
00:46:20,461 --> 00:46:23,794
What has David told me?
Nothing more than he's told you.

768
00:46:23,964 --> 00:46:27,263
- What is there to tell?
- I do not know, but I would like to.

769
00:46:27,434 --> 00:46:31,996
David said they'd been in Czechoslovakia,
Denmark, Poland, France and Switzerland.

770
00:46:32,172 --> 00:46:36,768
These are all countries that Germany
has either threatened or gone into.

771
00:46:36,944 --> 00:46:42,382
It is the German practice to send into
such countries men to prepare the way.

772
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:44,949
I had thought Herr Muller...

773
00:46:45,118 --> 00:46:47,313
...might be such a man.

774
00:46:49,289 --> 00:46:52,281
I do not think so now.

775
00:46:54,127 --> 00:46:58,257
- What are you doing?
- Wondering why luggage is unlocked.

776
00:46:58,432 --> 00:47:01,333
And a shabby briefcase
is so carefully locked.

777
00:47:02,169 --> 00:47:04,603
You're very curious about Mr. Muller.

778
00:47:04,771 --> 00:47:07,672
I'm curious about a daughter
of the Farrellys...

779
00:47:07,841 --> 00:47:11,106
...who marries a German
who has bullet scars...

780
00:47:11,712 --> 00:47:13,304
...and broken bones in his hands.

781
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,641
Is he any business of yours?

782
00:47:15,816 --> 00:47:19,252
- Why, anything might be my business now.
- Yes, unfortunately.

783
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:22,047
Well, you sound very bitter
about me, Marthe.

784
00:47:22,222 --> 00:47:24,486
Are you in love with David?

785
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,950
- What kind of talk is this?
- Answer me.

786
00:47:27,561 --> 00:47:29,028
I like him.

787
00:47:29,196 --> 00:47:32,359
Yes, and he likes you.

788
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:35,360
Please find out from him
about Herr Muller.

789
00:47:35,536 --> 00:47:37,970
I will certainly do no such thing.

790
00:47:38,539 --> 00:47:41,599
Ask your friends at the embassy.
They always know their nationals.

791
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:46,075
Yes. But I do not like to ask questions
without knowing the value of the answers.

792
00:47:46,246 --> 00:47:48,407
Teck, leave these people alone.

793
00:47:48,582 --> 00:47:51,779
They've evidently had a tough enough time.
I won't let you interfere.

794
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,749
Won't let me interfere?

795
00:47:53,921 --> 00:47:56,617
You are in love with David.
Do not make any plans, Marthe.

796
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:59,850
You will go with me
when I am ready to go.

797
00:48:33,059 --> 00:48:35,857
On Saturday, Madame Fanny and I
arrived at Savitt's.

798
00:48:36,029 --> 00:48:39,157
Before that I have taken
all the measurements in secret.

799
00:48:39,332 --> 00:48:43,132
First, Madame Fanny has delivered
a most sharp ultimatum...

800
00:48:43,303 --> 00:48:46,466
...that all must be finished in a week.

801
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,699
Savitt's?
What must be finished in a week?

802
00:48:48,875 --> 00:48:52,572
Clothes for all of you. In an amount
you have not previously considered.

803
00:48:53,046 --> 00:48:55,412
Dresses, suits, summer clothes,
stockings.

804
00:48:55,582 --> 00:48:58,745
All must be done with the hand sewing.

805
00:48:58,919 --> 00:49:03,618
How nice. How very, very nice of Mama.

806
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:05,519
What is so nice of Mama?

807
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:08,217
You are to say nothing. I gave my word.

808
00:49:08,395 --> 00:49:11,626
Everything is nice of Mama.
Mama is a great darling.

809
00:49:11,798 --> 00:49:15,234
Certainly. We've been in the attic
looking over some old books.

810
00:49:15,402 --> 00:49:17,962
You know, I find that Joshua
is an educated boy.

811
00:49:18,138 --> 00:49:20,038
Your father would have liked that.

812
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:23,870
Goodness.
You are a handsome woman, Sara.

813
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:27,502
- Where did the dress come from?
- From me. I make it.

814
00:49:27,681 --> 00:49:30,809
Remember when I was a little girl
and you taught me to sew?

815
00:49:30,984 --> 00:49:33,111
That came in handy years later.

816
00:49:33,286 --> 00:49:36,483
Often when Kurt...
When Kurt was away for a long while...

817
00:49:36,656 --> 00:49:40,422
...I made dresses and earned enough
to pay the rent and food...

818
00:49:40,594 --> 00:49:42,221
...and send the children to school.

819
00:49:42,395 --> 00:49:44,260
FANNY:
You sewed for a living?

820
00:49:44,431 --> 00:49:47,992
Really, were these things necessary?
Why couldn't you have written to us?

821
00:49:48,168 --> 00:49:51,660
Mama, you've asked me that 20 times
in the four days we've been here.

822
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:54,830
I think it is only that Grandma
feels sorry for us.

823
00:49:55,008 --> 00:49:57,306
Grandma has not seen
much of the world.

824
00:49:57,477 --> 00:50:00,935
She does not understand that a great many
work hard in order that they eat.

825
00:50:01,114 --> 00:50:05,710
Now, don't you start giving me lectures.
I get enough from Bodo. Come along.

826
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,145
Psst.

827
00:50:12,325 --> 00:50:14,054
[WHISPERING]
Ask Herr Muller to come up here.

828
00:50:14,227 --> 00:50:15,922
- Why?
- Why? Why?

829
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:19,964
Because he is a man in love with his wife
and because his wife looks most beautiful.

830
00:50:20,133 --> 00:50:22,897
You are getting so old
you no longer understand...

831
00:50:23,069 --> 00:50:25,003
...the matters of delicacy
between the men and the women.

832
00:50:25,171 --> 00:50:26,468
[LAUGHS]

833
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,717
Me?

834
00:50:41,087 --> 00:50:42,952
I had forgotten.

835
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:56,701
<i>Liebe,</i> Sara. You are beautiful.

836
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:03,400
How many years
have I kept you from looking like that?

837
00:51:04,477 --> 00:51:08,072
It makes you have tears.
It also makes me have tears.

838
00:51:08,248 --> 00:51:10,580
If you say that, I'll tear it off.

839
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:13,014
No. No.

840
00:51:13,186 --> 00:51:15,211
Then I do not say it.

841
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:17,316
I do not think it.

842
00:51:17,857 --> 00:51:21,691
I only think with pride
how beautiful is my Sara.

843
00:51:24,397 --> 00:51:28,925
Anise has put me together with pins.
I'm a porcupine.

844
00:51:29,903 --> 00:51:33,031
If you had not married me
so many years ago...

845
00:51:33,273 --> 00:51:35,571
...would you have married me today?

846
00:51:36,376 --> 00:51:41,370
I'm so tired, so shabby.
And you are so...

847
00:51:42,515 --> 00:51:46,110
I would have married you
any day in my life.

848
00:51:51,992 --> 00:51:55,428
With Mama, what you need is not to be
afraid of making a fool of yourself.

849
00:51:55,595 --> 00:51:57,859
Anything she doesn't like,
she makes seem silly.

850
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:00,090
Yes. And it's worked
for a good many years.

851
00:52:00,266 --> 00:52:02,632
She thinks of me only
as a monument to Papa.

852
00:52:02,802 --> 00:52:04,770
And a not-very-well-made monument
at that.

853
00:52:04,938 --> 00:52:10,069
Yes. And since you're worth a good deal
on your own, do what you want.

854
00:52:11,011 --> 00:52:13,206
Marthe's a nice girl, I think.

855
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,543
Kurt thinks so too,
and Kurt's smart about people.

856
00:52:17,584 --> 00:52:19,950
You are very much in love with Kurt.

857
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,951
Oh, yes. I've been a happy woman.

858
00:52:22,856 --> 00:52:26,383
David, Kurt's a sick man.
Sicker than he knows.

859
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:28,891
The wound he got in Spain
never healed right.

860
00:52:29,562 --> 00:52:33,054
And then about six months ago over there...
oh, he's better.

861
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,463
Even the week here has done him good.

862
00:52:35,635 --> 00:52:39,571
But he'll never be able to go back
and do the kind of work...

863
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,805
You know, darling...

864
00:52:41,975 --> 00:52:48,539
...I don't think I understand
what kind of work he was doing.

865
00:52:50,683 --> 00:52:52,674
SARA:
Come along, Babbie.

866
00:52:55,889 --> 00:52:58,289
How long has Marthe
been married to the count?

867
00:52:58,458 --> 00:53:01,222
I don't know. When she was very young.

868
00:53:01,394 --> 00:53:04,090
You know,
the Count de Brancovis scares me a little.

869
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:05,697
Scares you?

870
00:53:05,865 --> 00:53:08,425
You and Mama,
most people here, I guess...

871
00:53:08,601 --> 00:53:10,694
...you don't know what it is
to be frightened.

872
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:13,100
Unfortunately,
I think you'll have to learn.

873
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:16,470
Uncle David, I have invited
the Countess Marthe...

874
00:53:16,643 --> 00:53:20,670
...to join our sightseeing trip.
I hope you find it agreeable.

875
00:53:20,847 --> 00:53:23,315
Very, very agreeable.

876
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:28,046
- You're a nice girl, Babbie.
- Thank you, Mama.

877
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:46,633
To look down at such a great height
makes even me dizzy.

878
00:53:48,274 --> 00:53:50,504
Where is our house?

879
00:53:50,677 --> 00:53:52,042
Uh...

880
00:53:52,212 --> 00:53:54,271
See beyond the city?

881
00:53:54,714 --> 00:53:55,738
Yes.

882
00:53:55,915 --> 00:53:59,817
Where the road bends away
from the river, through the trees?

883
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:02,750
- Yes.
- Back of that.

884
00:54:05,925 --> 00:54:09,088
JoSEPH: But, Miss Fanny, you know
I've always been a good silver cleaner.

885
00:54:09,262 --> 00:54:13,528
- You're getting out of practice.
- I have given it careful thought.

886
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:16,965
Miss Sara is better-looking.
Don't you think so, Joseph?

887
00:54:17,137 --> 00:54:20,072
Don't you think Miss Sara
is better-looking than Miss Fanny?

888
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,231
You call that good cleaning?

889
00:54:22,408 --> 00:54:25,969
That silver has lasted for 200 years
and it's going to last for 200 more.

890
00:54:26,146 --> 00:54:30,082
Not the way you treat it, Miss Fanny.
Why, sometimes you scratch it.

891
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:32,741
I watch you at the table
and I say to myself:

892
00:54:32,919 --> 00:54:35,786
"There's Miss Fanny,
doing it to that knife again."

893
00:54:35,955 --> 00:54:39,015
I was using a knife and fork
before you arrived to show me how.

894
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:43,686
You told me the next time you screamed
at me to remind you to ask my pardon.

895
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:45,888
FANNY: You call that screaming?
- Yes'm.

896
00:54:46,065 --> 00:54:47,555
All right.

897
00:54:48,668 --> 00:54:50,533
I ask your pardon.

898
00:54:53,773 --> 00:54:55,240
Now clean that silver.

899
00:55:00,747 --> 00:55:03,341
It's very warm in Washington today.

900
00:55:03,516 --> 00:55:05,780
You'll forgive us.
We are dining in town tonight.

901
00:55:05,952 --> 00:55:08,182
- I will forgive you.
- You seen Marthe?

902
00:55:08,354 --> 00:55:10,879
She went on the sightseeing trip
with the children.

903
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:12,285
- And David.
- Oh.

904
00:55:12,458 --> 00:55:15,484
Well, I daresay she'll be back
in plenty of time to dress for dinner.

905
00:55:15,662 --> 00:55:17,323
I hope so.

906
00:58:10,937 --> 00:58:12,336
Baron von Ramme, please.

907
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:15,802
Phili? How are you?

908
00:58:15,975 --> 00:58:20,173
The other night in the poker game,

01:07:24,757 --> 01:07:29,319
That is bad.
It is sometimes the road to trouble.

1060
01:07:29,495 --> 01:07:32,293
I daresay. Good night.

1061
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:39,699
Kurt. Kurt.

1062
01:07:40,539 --> 01:07:42,507
It may not be true.

1063
01:07:42,841 --> 01:07:48,871
I am going to use the phone in your study
for a long-distance call, please.

1064
01:07:55,487 --> 01:07:58,650
- What is it, darling? What...?
- What is this all about, Sara?

1065
01:07:58,824 --> 01:08:01,122
I don't know all of it yet.

1066
01:08:01,293 --> 01:08:04,820
I do know that he broke open
Kurt's briefcase.

1067
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:07,431
And he saw what we carry with us.

1068
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:09,965
And he knows about Freidank...

1069
01:08:10,135 --> 01:08:12,695
...which probably means
he's guessing about Kurt.

1070
01:08:12,871 --> 01:08:15,931
What do you mean, what you carry with you
and guessing about Kurt?

1071
01:08:16,108 --> 01:08:19,236
- L...
- Kurt works in an illegal organization.

1072
01:08:19,411 --> 01:08:21,538
He has for seven years.

1073
01:08:21,714 --> 01:08:24,615
We're carrying with us $23,000 dollars.

1074
01:08:24,783 --> 01:08:26,717
It's been collected here and in Mexico...

1075
01:08:26,885 --> 01:08:31,618
...from the pennies and nickels
of poor people who don't like fascism...

1076
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:34,224
...and who believe in the work we do.

1077
01:08:34,493 --> 01:08:38,259
It was to be picked up and taken back
by the first men going.

1078
01:08:40,933 --> 01:08:43,197
Max and Kurt.

1079
01:08:44,003 --> 01:08:46,096
They loved each other.

1080
01:08:46,271 --> 01:08:49,399
They were in the war together.
And they were in Spain together.

1081
01:08:49,575 --> 01:08:54,342
Once in Spain,
Max made a medal from a ring.

1082
01:08:54,513 --> 01:08:59,314
"I make you a medal
because you're a fine soldier," he said.

1083
01:09:00,019 --> 01:09:02,510
And once, six months ago...

1084
01:09:02,688 --> 01:09:08,524
...Max rescued Kurt from the Gestapo
on a train and Kurt was badly hurt.

1085
01:09:08,727 --> 01:09:13,289
Max carried him on his back
for seven miles across the border.

1086
01:09:14,433 --> 01:09:17,402
But they caught him in the end.

1087
01:09:17,903 --> 01:09:20,531
If Max was caught...

1088
01:09:20,906 --> 01:09:23,739
...nobody's got much
of a chance anymore.

1089
01:09:23,909 --> 01:09:25,638
Nobody.

1090
01:09:25,811 --> 01:09:29,770
But wasn't it careless
to have $23,000 lying around to be seen?

1091
01:09:29,948 --> 01:09:34,715
No, it wasn't careless.
We've carried money that way for years.

1092
01:09:34,887 --> 01:09:38,482
There didn't seem to be any safer place
than my house.

1093
01:09:38,657 --> 01:09:42,593
It was careless of you and David
to have a man like that in this house.

1094
01:09:42,761 --> 01:09:45,889
- Yes. It was very careless.
- But how could we know?

1095
01:09:46,065 --> 01:09:48,556
The world has changed, Mama.

1096
01:09:48,734 --> 01:09:51,100
And some of the people in it
are dangerous.

1097
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:53,602
It's time you knew that.

1098
01:10:00,379 --> 01:10:01,676
It is true.

1099
01:10:02,147 --> 01:10:04,138
But he is not dead.

1100
01:10:05,484 --> 01:10:07,850
Hans and Ernst were taken with him.

1101
01:10:09,955 --> 01:10:12,651
Max is not an easy man to kill.

1102
01:10:14,059 --> 01:10:17,358
But most of his face and one arm...

1103
01:10:19,832 --> 01:10:22,357
It is not nice when it comes.

1104
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:29,202
Well, Sara...

1105
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:35,541
- No.
- It must be yes.

1106
01:10:35,714 --> 01:10:38,239
But Max knows you're not well enough.
He sent you here.

1107
01:10:38,417 --> 01:10:41,545
But now I am more well than he is.

1108
01:10:45,557 --> 01:10:46,956
When?

1109
01:10:48,026 --> 01:10:50,790
I think tonight, Sara, darling.

1110
01:10:50,963 --> 01:10:52,931
But I do not know.

1111
01:10:53,632 --> 01:10:55,725
It will depend on
the Count de Brancovis.

1112
01:10:57,269 --> 01:10:59,237
What will depend upon the count?

1113
01:11:00,906 --> 01:11:03,272
Did he steal the money?

1114
01:11:03,642 --> 01:11:06,133
He's not a man who steals.

1115
01:11:06,445 --> 01:11:08,436
It will come another way.

1116
01:11:08,614 --> 01:11:10,548
But why are you afraid of him?

1117
01:11:10,716 --> 01:11:13,981
You're in this country now.
There's nothing he can do.

1118
01:11:15,087 --> 01:11:16,816
We will see.

1119
01:11:18,457 --> 01:11:22,393
We will wait and we will see.

1120
01:11:23,395 --> 01:11:27,263
Kurt's not going to be in this country.

1121
01:11:27,599 --> 01:11:30,159
He's going back to get them out.

1122
01:11:32,171 --> 01:11:33,468
Is that right, Kurt?

1123
01:11:33,972 --> 01:11:35,371
Is that right?

1124
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:38,738
Yes, darling. I must try.

1125
01:11:38,911 --> 01:11:41,903
They were taken to Sonnenberg
and guards can be bribed there.

1126
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:44,878
It has been done once before
at Sonnenberg.

1127
01:11:45,150 --> 01:11:47,516
I will try for it that way.

1128
01:11:51,089 --> 01:11:53,319
Of course you must go back.

1129
01:11:53,492 --> 01:11:56,461
I guess I was trying to think
it wouldn't come.

1130
01:11:58,363 --> 01:12:00,160
Kurt's got to go back.

1131
01:12:00,332 --> 01:12:02,425
He's got to go home.

1132
01:12:02,901 --> 01:12:05,461
It's hard enough to get back...

1133
01:12:05,637 --> 01:12:07,901
...but if they knew he was coming...

1134
01:12:09,208 --> 01:12:11,642
They want Kurt bad.

1135
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:17,473
All right, Kurt.

1136
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:22,077
You'll do it. You'll get them out.

1137
01:12:22,254 --> 01:12:25,587
Kurt will do it. You'll see.

1138
01:12:25,757 --> 01:12:29,249
Don't be afraid, darling. You'll get back.

1139
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:31,362
You'll get Max out all right.

1140
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:33,760
And then you'll do his work, won't you?

1141
01:12:33,932 --> 01:12:35,729
And you'll do a good job.

1142
01:12:35,901 --> 01:12:38,267
The way you've always done.

1143
01:12:38,770 --> 01:12:40,897
Don't be afraid, darling.

1144
01:12:41,073 --> 01:12:42,267
You'll get home.

1145
01:12:42,908 --> 01:12:44,808
Yes, you will. You'll get home.

1146
01:12:44,977 --> 01:12:46,410
[SARA CRYING]

1147
01:12:46,645 --> 01:12:47,703
What is it, Mama?

1148
01:12:59,758 --> 01:13:02,488
You will be told later.

1149
01:13:02,661 --> 01:13:04,720
Don't worry now.

1150
01:13:06,265 --> 01:13:08,825
Will you go in to dinner, please?

1151
01:13:09,001 --> 01:13:11,060
We'll come in a minute.

1152
01:13:19,945 --> 01:13:21,435
Marthe...

1153
01:13:21,613 --> 01:13:25,310
...much has been going wrong.
With us and between us.

1154
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:28,612
But suppose... Suppose we could go back
to Europe again.

1155
01:13:28,787 --> 01:13:30,755
And with a little money.

1156
01:13:30,922 --> 01:13:33,322
Do you think we might pick up again
what we've lost?

1157
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:35,323
What we've lost?

1158
01:13:35,494 --> 01:13:38,622
I don't think there was ever
very much to lose.

1159
01:13:38,830 --> 01:13:41,458
And I left nothing in Europe
that I'd want to go back to.

1160
01:13:41,633 --> 01:13:44,295
You have other plans?
If so, you're wasting your time.

1161
01:13:44,469 --> 01:13:45,993
I will tell you what to do.

1162
01:13:46,171 --> 01:13:49,265
We are leaving the Farrelly house.
You and I. You understand?

1163
01:13:49,441 --> 01:13:51,033
Anything going wrong back there?

1164
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:55,344
- Drop me at the German Embassy.
- Like a hot potato, boss.

1165
01:13:57,549 --> 01:14:00,017
Now, go on to dinner.
I'll pick you up later.

1166
01:14:06,858 --> 01:14:09,486
Well, how did you manage
in the game the other night?

1167
01:14:09,661 --> 01:14:13,097
Count de Brancovis,
in this room I work.

1168
01:14:13,265 --> 01:14:14,892
That is commendable.

1169
01:14:15,434 --> 01:14:17,766
Your people caught Max Freidank.

1170
01:14:17,936 --> 01:14:21,372
Are there any others close
to Freidank perhaps that you want?

1171
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,770
BLECHER:
We want them all.

1172
01:14:24,209 --> 01:14:29,146
If I should know where one or more
of such men could be found...

1173
01:14:29,314 --> 01:14:32,340
...what would that information
be worth to your government?

1174
01:14:35,153 --> 01:14:38,816
It would depend on who they were
or where they were.

1175
01:14:40,192 --> 01:14:43,889
In the United States,
they would be worth very little.

1176
01:14:45,797 --> 01:14:48,960
- Nothing.
- Nothing at all?

1177
01:14:49,501 --> 01:14:50,991
What are we to do here?

1178
01:14:51,603 --> 01:14:53,935
Have them assassinated in an alley?

1179
01:14:54,106 --> 01:14:55,596
Kidnap them?

1180
01:14:55,774 --> 01:14:59,904
Follow them for months, hoping we'll know
when they go back to Germany?

1181
01:15:00,078 --> 01:15:01,670
Here are the lists.

1182
01:15:01,847 --> 01:15:05,840
With such men as these, that is not easy.

1183
01:15:06,885 --> 01:15:11,015
But show us where we can put our hands
on one of them in the fatherland...

1184
01:15:11,189 --> 01:15:16,126
...or in any of the countries where we have
influence, that is another matter.

1185
01:15:16,294 --> 01:15:19,263
You could name your own price,
in reason.

1186
01:15:19,798 --> 01:15:22,631
We might also manage a visa for you.

1187
01:15:22,801 --> 01:15:27,295
I'm sure you are homesick
for shabby palaces and gaudy cafs...

1188
01:15:27,472 --> 01:15:32,068
...and the rest of the decaying things
that represent Europe to you.

1189
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:36,172
Blecher, we do not like each other.

1190
01:15:36,548 --> 01:15:41,281
But that will not stand in the way
of our doing business.

1191
01:15:54,566 --> 01:15:56,557
Would you stop that pacing about?

1192
01:15:56,735 --> 01:15:58,498
Please.

1193
01:15:59,104 --> 01:16:01,834
And tomorrow,
because it's Babbie's birthday...

1194
01:16:02,007 --> 01:16:04,339
...I shall go and buy presents
for everybody.

1195
01:16:04,509 --> 01:16:05,601
We always do that here.

1196
01:16:05,777 --> 01:16:10,373
It started because I didn't like not getting
presents on other people's birthdays.

1197
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:14,183
And we'll have music in the evening.

1198
01:16:16,087 --> 01:16:18,612
Yes. Yes, we'll have a fine time.

1199
01:16:18,790 --> 01:16:21,691
- You think you fool us.
- What?

1200
01:16:22,294 --> 01:16:24,558
Something has gone wrong.

1201
01:16:24,729 --> 01:16:27,823
Always Mama and Papa look like that
when it happens so.

1202
01:16:29,501 --> 01:16:32,402
You must not be nervous
for our sake, Grandma.

1203
01:16:32,571 --> 01:16:35,540
We will do whatever it is
Mama and Papa will ask of us.

1204
01:16:35,707 --> 01:16:38,540
Yes, you... You always have.

1205
01:16:39,244 --> 01:16:40,677
Now, would you go upstairs?

1206
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:44,145
Later I will come and say good night.

1207
01:16:46,318 --> 01:16:49,412
- Good night.
- Good night.

1208
01:17:11,943 --> 01:17:15,470
You're going away again,
aren't you, Papa?

1209
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:17,114
Yes.

1210
01:17:17,282 --> 01:17:19,250
You must let me come along.

1211
01:17:19,417 --> 01:17:22,284
I will help in... In small ways.

1212
01:17:22,454 --> 01:17:25,389
I will learn. You will teach me.

1213
01:17:25,557 --> 01:17:27,320
I am not as yet a man...

1214
01:17:27,492 --> 01:17:31,360
...and it would not be of such importance
if anything happened to me.

1215
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:38,394
I will give you some rules now.

1216
01:17:39,437 --> 01:17:41,428
Please remember them, Joshua.

1217
01:17:41,606 --> 01:17:42,971
And never to disobey them.

1218
01:17:45,477 --> 01:17:47,240
Our forces are small.

1219
01:17:47,846 --> 01:17:51,111
Therefore, we must risk no more men
in any enterprise...

1220
01:17:51,283 --> 01:17:53,342
...than it is needed to carry it out.

1221
01:17:53,518 --> 01:17:56,248
Always in our work,
a man will wish to go with you.

1222
01:17:56,421 --> 01:17:57,752
That is wrong.

1223
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:59,948
We are not here
to show that we are brave...

1224
01:18:00,125 --> 01:18:02,025
...and not to be modest, either, and say:

1225
01:18:02,193 --> 01:18:04,889
"I am not important.
Let me take the risk."

1226
01:18:05,063 --> 01:18:07,759
He takes the risk who is entitled to it.

1227
01:18:08,199 --> 01:18:10,497
Soon you will be a man.

1228
01:18:11,236 --> 01:18:13,101
Never have I doubted that for you.

1229
01:18:13,271 --> 01:18:14,761
Also...

1230
01:18:15,006 --> 01:18:17,873
...this will be what a man
should most do.

1231
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:20,141
I'm right?

1232
01:18:20,312 --> 01:18:21,506
Of course, Papa.

1233
01:18:22,881 --> 01:18:24,644
You are young.

1234
01:18:24,816 --> 01:18:27,580
You are smart. You are strong.

1235
01:18:27,752 --> 01:18:30,448
You are a fine investment for our work...

1236
01:18:30,622 --> 01:18:32,522
...when the time comes.

1237
01:18:32,691 --> 01:18:34,659
In the meantime, I give you orders.

1238
01:18:35,327 --> 01:18:36,817
You think...

1239
01:18:36,995 --> 01:18:40,226
...you've trained yourself
in mind and body.

1240
01:18:40,865 --> 01:18:42,628
Your day is not so distant.

1241
01:18:43,435 --> 01:18:47,963
If it should come
and I have not as yet returned...

1242
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:52,200
It is not wise, perhaps,
to speak so far in the future...

1243
01:18:52,611 --> 01:18:54,636
...but the world goes bad...

1244
01:18:54,813 --> 01:18:58,010
...and who knows
how long that will last.

1245
01:18:58,350 --> 01:19:03,845
Therefore, with delicacy and care,
I wish you also to prepare Bodo...

1246
01:19:04,122 --> 01:19:05,714
...when his time too shall come.

1247
01:19:05,890 --> 01:19:07,255
God help us.

1248
01:19:11,062 --> 01:19:12,188
Go upstairs now.

1249
01:19:12,631 --> 01:19:14,724
Say nothing to the others.

1250
01:19:14,899 --> 01:19:16,730
I will come later.

1251
01:19:26,444 --> 01:19:29,709
FANNY: Does Kurt intend
to bribe his friends out of prison?

1252
01:19:29,881 --> 01:19:32,076
- Is that what he said?
- Yes.

1253
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:34,184
FANNY:
It's all very strange to me.

1254
01:19:34,352 --> 01:19:36,684
I thought things were so well run that...

1255
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:38,720
What wonderful work
fascists have done...

1256
01:19:38,890 --> 01:19:41,586
...in convincing people
they are men from legends.

1257
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,820
They've done very well
for themselves, unfortunately.

1258
01:19:44,996 --> 01:19:47,362
But not by themselves.

1259
01:19:47,699 --> 01:19:51,396
We don't like to remember, do we,
that they came in on the shoulders...

1260
01:19:51,569 --> 01:19:53,935
...of some of the most powerful men
in the world.

1261
01:19:54,105 --> 01:19:57,541
That makes us feel guilty
so we prefer to believe...

1262
01:19:57,709 --> 01:20:00,507
...that they're mysterious men
from the planets.

1263
01:20:00,679 --> 01:20:02,271
Well, they aren't.

1264
01:20:02,447 --> 01:20:05,575
They're smart and they're sick...

1265
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:07,581
...and they're cruel.

1266
01:20:07,752 --> 01:20:13,088
But, given men who know
what they fight for, and will fight hard...

1267
01:20:13,258 --> 01:20:14,816
Yes.

1268
01:20:15,026 --> 01:20:17,824
Given men
who know what they fight for.

1269
01:20:18,430 --> 01:20:20,398
I will console you.

1270
01:20:20,565 --> 01:20:23,193
A year ago last month,
3:00 in the morning...

1271
01:20:23,368 --> 01:20:25,768
...Freidank and I,
with two elderly pistols...

1272
01:20:25,937 --> 01:20:28,701
...raided the home of the Gestapo chief
in Konstanz.

1273
01:20:28,873 --> 01:20:31,273
We got what we wanted,
and the following morning...

1274
01:20:31,443 --> 01:20:34,537
...Freidank was eating his breakfast
three blocks away...

1275
01:20:34,713 --> 01:20:36,476
...and I was over the Swiss border.

1276
01:20:36,648 --> 01:20:39,116
FANNY:
You are brave men.

1277
01:20:39,684 --> 01:20:42,744
I do not tell you the story
to prove that we are remarkable...

1278
01:20:42,921 --> 01:20:44,513
...but to prove that they are not.

1279
01:20:44,689 --> 01:20:46,623
Would you like a drink?

1280
01:20:46,791 --> 01:20:49,817
You look... You look very tired.

1281
01:20:49,994 --> 01:20:51,985
It is waiting...

1282
01:20:52,797 --> 01:20:54,389
...waiting that is bad for me.

1283
01:20:54,566 --> 01:20:57,865
FANNY: But I really don't understand
what you're waiting for.

1284
01:20:58,036 --> 01:20:59,401
Now, I mean.

1285
01:20:59,571 --> 01:21:03,940
I think the Count de Brancovis
will try tonight to find out who I am.

1286
01:21:04,375 --> 01:21:07,469
I wait now to see
if he has so found me out.

1287
01:21:07,645 --> 01:21:10,842
Beyond that, I myself,
do not understand.

1288
01:21:11,015 --> 01:21:13,347
But there's nothing he can do.

1289
01:21:13,518 --> 01:21:15,076
Waiting.

1290
01:21:16,755 --> 01:21:17,779
Once, in Spain...

1291
01:21:17,956 --> 01:21:22,325
...I waited two days for the fascist planes
to exhaust themselves.

1292
01:21:23,094 --> 01:21:28,464
I say finally to myself,
if I must reach up with my naked hands...

1293
01:21:28,633 --> 01:21:30,601
...I will stop them.

1294
01:21:33,705 --> 01:21:36,003
It is such waiting for which I am not fit.

1295
01:21:36,174 --> 01:21:38,540
You will not think that
when the time comes.

1296
01:21:38,710 --> 01:21:41,201
- It will go.
- Of a certainty.

1297
01:21:41,379 --> 01:21:44,610
But must it always be your hands?

1298
01:21:44,783 --> 01:21:47,911
For each man, his own hands.
He has to sleep with them.

1299
01:21:48,086 --> 01:21:50,680
That's right.
I guess it's the way we should all feel.

1300
01:21:50,855 --> 01:21:53,585
But... But you have a family.

1301
01:21:53,758 --> 01:21:57,125
Isn't there somebody else
who hasn't a wife and children?

1302
01:21:57,295 --> 01:21:59,820
Each could find his own excuse.

1303
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:04,731
Some have bullet holes, some have fear
of the camps and many are getting older.

1304
01:22:04,903 --> 01:22:08,031
Each could find a reason. Many find it.

1305
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:11,803
And my children are not the only children
in the world, even to me.

1306
01:22:11,976 --> 01:22:14,069
That's noble of you, of course, but...

1307
01:22:14,412 --> 01:22:17,210
one means always in English
to insult with that word, noble?

1308
01:22:17,382 --> 01:22:19,873
- Of course not.
- It is not noble.

1309
01:22:20,051 --> 01:22:21,882
It is only the way I must live.

1310
01:22:22,053 --> 01:22:23,850
FANNY:
But I was thinking of Sara.

1311
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:28,652
I want it this way, Mama.
The way Kurt wants it.

1312
01:22:29,093 --> 01:22:31,891
You wanted a good life for your children.

1313
01:22:32,230 --> 01:22:34,790
We want it for ours too.

1314
01:22:35,333 --> 01:22:39,269
This is Kurt's way
of trying to get it for them.

1315
01:22:43,007 --> 01:22:44,634
Good evening.

1316
01:22:44,809 --> 01:22:48,677
There's something bad happening,
isn't there?

1317
01:22:48,847 --> 01:22:52,180
I have been to the German Embassy
tonight, Herr Muller.

1318
01:22:52,350 --> 01:22:56,013
Yes. That's where
I thought you would go.

1319
01:22:56,187 --> 01:22:59,816
I don't know what this is all about,
but I'm guessing, because I know Teck.

1320
01:22:59,991 --> 01:23:03,984
I have nothing to do with any of it. And
I have nothing to do with Teck anymore.

1321
01:23:04,162 --> 01:23:06,824
If you do not mean what you're saying,
change your mind.

1322
01:23:06,998 --> 01:23:08,397
You are talking most unwisely.

1323
01:23:08,566 --> 01:23:11,467
You are trying to frighten me.
But you're not going to anymore.

1324
01:23:11,636 --> 01:23:14,503
I'm not going away with you
and I'm never going away with you.

1325
01:23:14,672 --> 01:23:17,732
- Shall we talk about this alone?
- You can't make me stay with you.

1326
01:23:17,909 --> 01:23:20,469
You can't make stay now
that I'm not frightened anymore.

1327
01:23:20,645 --> 01:23:23,842
- No, perhaps not.
- Then there's nothing to talk about.

1328
01:23:24,115 --> 01:23:25,742
You're in love with him?

1329
01:23:25,917 --> 01:23:29,546
You never can understand anything
that hasn't got tricks to it.

1330
01:23:29,721 --> 01:23:32,622
I don't like you, Teck. I never have.

1331
01:23:32,790 --> 01:23:35,691
We will not leave here together
and we will not meet again.

1332
01:23:37,428 --> 01:23:39,293
Not now.

1333
01:23:41,065 --> 01:23:42,760
Good night.

1334
01:23:43,635 --> 01:23:45,000
Well...

1335
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:48,034
A great many things have been said
in the past few minutes.

1336
01:23:48,206 --> 01:23:49,503
David, am I to understand...?

1337
01:23:49,674 --> 01:23:52,108
You are to understand anything you like.

1338
01:23:52,277 --> 01:23:55,110
Without Marthe,
I shall be a very lonely man.

1339
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,874
Already, I'm a very poor one.

1340
01:23:59,183 --> 01:24:02,914
Before I go tonight,
I should like to have $ 10,000.

1341
01:24:03,087 --> 01:24:06,545
- You, blackmailing with your wife, you...
KURT: No, David.

1342
01:24:06,724 --> 01:24:09,852
The Count de Brancovis is not bargaining
with you or Marthe.

1343
01:24:10,028 --> 01:24:11,154
He is talking to me.

1344
01:24:12,430 --> 01:24:14,193
Is that correct?

1345
01:24:14,365 --> 01:24:15,423
Good.

1346
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,465
I see that you understand.

1347
01:24:17,635 --> 01:24:20,900
I got from the embassy
a list and descriptions...

1348
01:24:21,072 --> 01:24:23,597
...without, of course,
saying why I wanted them.

1349
01:24:23,775 --> 01:24:27,871
But if I have to take any more of that,
I shall go immediately back to them.

1350
01:24:28,046 --> 01:24:29,843
You will not again be interrupted.

1351
01:24:30,014 --> 01:24:33,006
Very well.
There were many names on the list.

1352
01:24:33,184 --> 01:24:38,315
And among the descriptions is this,
of a man we shall call Gotter...

1353
01:24:38,489 --> 01:24:42,425
...because that is the name
he has most often used.

1354
01:24:43,561 --> 01:24:48,225
"Age, 40 to 45. About 6 feet.
One hundred and seventy pounds.

1355
01:24:48,399 --> 01:24:50,867
Many descriptions.
All of them unreliable.

1356
01:24:51,035 --> 01:24:54,027
Married to a foreign woman,
either English or American.

1357
01:24:54,205 --> 01:24:55,297
Three children.

1358
01:24:55,473 --> 01:24:59,000
Has used the names of Gotter,
Thomas Bodmor, Karl Francis.

1359
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:03,170
Thought to have left Germany in 1933 and
to have joined the notorious Max Freidank.

1360
01:25:03,581 --> 01:25:07,574
Known to have crossed border in 1934,
February, May, June, october.

1361
01:25:07,752 --> 01:25:09,743
And again, with Freidank in 1935...

1362
01:25:09,921 --> 01:25:13,379
...and in August, october,
November, 1936."

1363
01:25:13,558 --> 01:25:15,082
An active man, this Gotter.

1364
01:25:15,259 --> 01:25:17,489
Yes. Very.

1365
01:25:17,662 --> 01:25:20,927
It would've been impossible for a magician
to have crossed that often.

1366
01:25:21,099 --> 01:25:23,465
Really? Well, to go on.

1367
01:25:23,634 --> 01:25:29,595
"In 1934, outlaw radio station announcing
itself as Radio European begins to operate.

1368
01:25:29,774 --> 01:25:34,143
Gotter was known to have crossed border
before and after three of the broadcasts.

1369
01:25:34,312 --> 01:25:37,941
Gotter believed to have then appeared
in Spain with Madrid government army.

1370
01:25:38,116 --> 01:25:41,381
Known to have lived in France
the first months of 1938.

1371
01:25:41,552 --> 01:25:44,112
Again, crossed border
sometime during week...

1372
01:25:44,288 --> 01:25:48,315
...when Hitler's Hamburg radio speech
was interrupted off the air."

1373
01:25:48,493 --> 01:25:50,358
That was a daring deed, Herr Muller.

1374
01:25:50,528 --> 01:25:53,429
I remember it well. It amused me.

1375
01:25:53,598 --> 01:25:56,658
- It was not done for that reason.
- No?

1376
01:25:56,834 --> 01:26:01,862
"Early in 1939, an informer in Konstanz
reported Gotter's arrival with Freidank...

1377
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:04,736
...carrying money
exchanged in Paris and Brussels.

1378
01:26:04,909 --> 01:26:07,241
Following day,
home of Konstanz Gestapo chief...

1379
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:11,041
...was raided by two men
who took spy list and escaped."

1380
01:26:11,215 --> 01:26:14,480
Herr Muller, that job took two good men.

1381
01:26:14,652 --> 01:26:17,052
Even you admire them.

1382
01:26:17,221 --> 01:26:18,882
TECK:
Even I.

1383
01:26:19,357 --> 01:26:23,054
Now, I think you are Gotter,
Thomas Bodmor, Karl...

1384
01:26:23,227 --> 01:26:25,127
Please do not describe me
to myself again.

1385
01:26:25,296 --> 01:26:28,629
I think that because Freidank has been
taken, you'll be traveling home.

1386
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:32,292
If I am wrong, and you will not be going
back, the German Embassy will...

1387
01:26:32,470 --> 01:26:33,801
KURT:
I am going back.

1388
01:26:34,105 --> 01:26:35,800
I will start tonight.

1389
01:26:35,973 --> 01:26:38,874
So. You tell me free of charge.

1390
01:26:39,043 --> 01:26:41,034
Well, I will tell you free of charge...

1391
01:26:41,212 --> 01:26:44,375
...that I do not believe
they've forced information out of Freidank.

1392
01:26:44,549 --> 01:26:46,073
Thank you.

1393
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:49,811
But I was sure they would not.
I know all three most well.

1394
01:26:49,987 --> 01:26:54,151
They will be able to stand up under...
Under whatever is given them.

1395
01:26:54,325 --> 01:26:58,091
Yes. There is a deep sickness
in the German character.

1396
01:26:58,262 --> 01:27:00,321
A love of death, a love of pain.

1397
01:27:00,498 --> 01:27:03,228
- Spare us your moral judgments.
- Yes, they're sickening.

1398
01:27:03,401 --> 01:27:06,837
- Get on with your dirty business.
- Fanny and David are Americans.

1399
01:27:07,004 --> 01:27:09,063
They do not understand our world.

1400
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:11,800
And if they are fortunate, they never will.

1401
01:27:11,976 --> 01:27:14,911
All fascists are not of one mind,
one stripe.

1402
01:27:15,313 --> 01:27:17,372
There are those who give the orders...

1403
01:27:17,548 --> 01:27:19,243
...and there those who take them.

1404
01:27:19,417 --> 01:27:20,714
They came late.

1405
01:27:20,885 --> 01:27:24,150
Some of them were, up to a point,
fastidious men.

1406
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:26,654
For these,
we may someday have pity.

1407
01:27:26,824 --> 01:27:28,257
They are lost men.

1408
01:27:28,426 --> 01:27:32,829
Their spoils are small.
Their days gone. Yes?

1409
01:27:32,997 --> 01:27:34,988
You have the understanding heart.

1410
01:27:35,166 --> 01:27:37,691
- Someday, it will get in your way.
KURT: I will watch it.

1411
01:27:37,869 --> 01:27:39,734
We are both men in trouble, Herr Muller.

1412
01:27:39,904 --> 01:27:43,840
The world, perhaps ungratefully, seems to
like your kind even less than it does mine.

1413
01:27:44,008 --> 01:27:46,533
Now let us do business.

1414
01:27:47,011 --> 01:27:50,003
You will not get back
if I inform the embassy that you are going.

1415
01:27:50,181 --> 01:27:53,878
- They will see that you are killed before.
- You are wrong.

1416
01:27:54,051 --> 01:27:56,713
I will not be killed before I get there.

1417
01:27:56,888 --> 01:27:58,515
I will get back.

1418
01:27:58,689 --> 01:28:01,123
There are men
they would like to have besides me.

1419
01:28:01,292 --> 01:28:03,419
I would be allowed
to walk directly to them.

1420
01:28:03,594 --> 01:28:06,256
Until they had all the names
and all the addresses.

1421
01:28:06,430 --> 01:28:08,557
Romanians would pick me up
ahead of time.

1422
01:28:08,733 --> 01:28:09,791
Germans would not.

1423
01:28:10,401 --> 01:28:13,768
- Still the national pride?
- And why not, for that which is good?

1424
01:28:13,938 --> 01:28:17,897
I haven't felt what I feel now. Whatever
you are and however you became it...

1425
01:28:18,075 --> 01:28:20,543
...the picture of a man
selling other men's lives...

1426
01:28:20,711 --> 01:28:23,805
Is very ugly, Madame Fanny.
I do not do it without some shame.

1427
01:28:23,981 --> 01:28:26,950
And I must therefore
sink my shame in large money.

1428
01:28:28,386 --> 01:28:32,413
- You have over $20,000 in your briefcase.
- Yes. You are an expert with locks.

1429
01:28:32,590 --> 01:28:35,889
For $ 10,000 you can go back
to wherever you go.

1430
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:38,620
No one will know that you go,
I will give you my wishes.

1431
01:28:38,796 --> 01:28:40,559
- What?
- No.

1432
01:28:40,765 --> 01:28:43,563
That money will go back with me
as it is.

1433
01:28:43,734 --> 01:28:46,965
It was not given to me to save my life
and I shall not so use it.

1434
01:28:47,138 --> 01:28:50,232
It is to save the lives
and further the work of more than I.

1435
01:28:50,408 --> 01:28:53,241
And it is important to me
to carry on that work.

1436
01:28:53,411 --> 01:28:55,140
And, Count de Brancovis...

1437
01:28:55,313 --> 01:28:59,249
...the first morning when we arrived
in this country, my children were hungry.

1438
01:28:59,417 --> 01:29:02,853
That is because we were not able
to buy sufficient breakfast for them.

1439
01:29:03,020 --> 01:29:05,818
If I wouldn't touch that money for them,
I wouldn't for you.

1440
01:29:05,990 --> 01:29:07,753
It goes back with me as it is.

1441
01:29:07,925 --> 01:29:11,520
And if it does not get back,
it is because I will not get back.

1442
01:29:11,696 --> 01:29:13,288
TECK:
I do not think you will get back.

1443
01:29:13,631 --> 01:29:16,623
You're a brave one, Herr Muller,
but you will not get back.

1444
01:29:17,235 --> 01:29:21,069
I will send you a postal card
and tell you all about my bravery.

1445
01:29:21,472 --> 01:29:24,236
Is it true that if this swine talks,
you and the others...?

1446
01:29:24,408 --> 01:29:26,000
SARA:
Will be caught and killed.

1447
01:29:26,477 --> 01:29:28,945
If they're lucky enough
to be killed quickly.

1448
01:29:29,113 --> 01:29:31,081
All right. We'll give him the money.

1449
01:29:31,249 --> 01:29:34,082
Let's give it to him
and get him out of here.

1450
01:29:38,055 --> 01:29:40,114
Do you want him to go back?

1451
01:29:41,192 --> 01:29:43,683
Yes, I do.

1452
01:29:44,695 --> 01:29:46,185
DAVID:
All right.

1453
01:29:46,530 --> 01:29:48,623
You're a good girl, Sara.

1454
01:29:52,003 --> 01:29:55,370
If we give you the money, what's to keep
you from selling to the embassy?

1455
01:29:55,539 --> 01:29:57,439
I do not like your thinking I'd do that.

1456
01:29:57,608 --> 01:30:00,076
Look, I'm sick of what you'd like
or wouldn't like.

1457
01:30:00,244 --> 01:30:02,610
We'll get this over
without fancy talk from you.

1458
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:04,975
I can't take much more of you
at any cost.

1459
01:30:05,149 --> 01:30:07,310
But it is your anger which delays us.

1460
01:30:07,485 --> 01:30:10,386
I suggest that you give me
a small amount of cash now...

1461
01:30:10,554 --> 01:30:12,988
...and the rest in a check
dated a month from now.

1462
01:30:13,157 --> 01:30:16,217
In a month, Muller should be home,
let you know that he is safe...

1463
01:30:16,394 --> 01:30:20,524
...and that I have kept my bargain. We are
taking chances on each other, of course.

1464
01:30:20,698 --> 01:30:25,192
But I suppose one always does
on a deal of such delicacy as ours.

1465
01:30:25,603 --> 01:30:28,128
DAVID: Is a month all right?
- What?

1466
01:30:28,306 --> 01:30:30,171
I do not know.

1467
01:30:30,775 --> 01:30:33,767
Two months. How do you want the check,
how do you want the cash?

1468
01:30:33,944 --> 01:30:35,969
One month. That I will not discuss.

1469
01:30:36,147 --> 01:30:39,048
One month. Please decide now.

1470
01:30:40,084 --> 01:30:41,847
All right. How do you want it?

1471
01:30:42,019 --> 01:30:44,954
Seventy-five hundred in a check,
2500 in cash.

1472
01:30:45,122 --> 01:30:46,953
Leave your address.
I'll send the money.

1473
01:30:47,124 --> 01:30:50,093
Address? I have no address.
And I wish it now.

1474
01:30:50,261 --> 01:30:52,024
I haven't that much cash in the house.

1475
01:30:52,196 --> 01:30:54,858
I have 15 or 1600
in the sitting-room safe.

1476
01:30:55,032 --> 01:30:57,762
Very well, that will do.
Make the rest in a check.

1477
01:30:59,070 --> 01:31:00,731
Get it, Mama.

1478
01:31:13,451 --> 01:31:16,079
The new world has left the room.

1479
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:19,011
I feel less discomfort with you.

1480
01:31:19,190 --> 01:31:23,320
We are Europeans,
born to trouble and understanding it.

1481
01:31:23,494 --> 01:31:27,191
- My wife is not European.
- Almost.

1482
01:31:27,498 --> 01:31:30,592
They are young.
The world has gone well for most of them.

1483
01:31:30,768 --> 01:31:33,464
For us, the three of us...

1484
01:31:33,637 --> 01:31:40,167
...we're like peasants
watching the big frost: Work, trouble, ruin.

1485
01:31:40,344 --> 01:31:42,574
But no need to call curses at the frost.

1486
01:31:43,147 --> 01:31:47,413
There it is. There it will be again.
Always for us.

1487
01:31:48,519 --> 01:31:52,615
Me and my husband and I do not have
angry words for you.

1488
01:31:53,124 --> 01:31:55,024
It goes deeper than that with us.

1489
01:31:55,960 --> 01:31:58,929
We know how many there are of you.

1490
01:31:59,897 --> 01:32:02,491
They don't, yet.

1491
01:32:02,666 --> 01:32:06,659
My mother and brother feel shocked
that you're in their house.

1492
01:32:06,937 --> 01:32:10,236
We have seen you in so many houses.

1493
01:32:10,408 --> 01:32:13,673
I do not say that you want
to understand me, Mrs. Muller.

1494
01:32:13,844 --> 01:32:16,472
I say only that you do.

1495
01:32:17,047 --> 01:32:20,346
Yes, you are not difficult to understand.

1496
01:32:27,191 --> 01:32:29,455
- Whiskey?
- No, thank you.

1497
01:32:33,297 --> 01:32:34,855
Brandy?

1498
01:32:35,299 --> 01:32:37,096
Thank you, I will.

1499
01:32:38,469 --> 01:32:40,801
You, too, wish to go back
to Europe, huh?

1500
01:32:40,971 --> 01:32:42,199
Yes.

1501
01:32:42,373 --> 01:32:44,204
But they do not much want you there.

1502
01:32:44,375 --> 01:32:46,969
I do not think the embassy
would pay you in money...

1503
01:32:47,144 --> 01:32:50,011
...for a description of a man
who has a month to travel.

1504
01:32:50,181 --> 01:32:52,741
But I think they would pay you in a visa.

1505
01:32:54,251 --> 01:32:57,243
And I think you want a visa
almost as much as you want money.

1506
01:32:57,421 --> 01:33:01,517
I conclude that you will try for the money
here and for the visa from the embassy.

1507
01:33:01,926 --> 01:33:04,918
I cannot get anywhere near Germany
in a month and you know that.

1508
01:33:06,030 --> 01:33:09,295
I've been bored with this talk
of paying you money.

1509
01:33:09,467 --> 01:33:13,335
If they are willing to try you
in this fantasy, I am not.

1510
01:33:13,504 --> 01:33:16,234
Unlike you, I am not a gambler,
I do not take chances.

1511
01:33:19,410 --> 01:33:21,241

enough away from here.

You are not children.
I took your childhood all away from you.

You remember

01:43:16,640 --> 01:43:18,835
...and Bodo got candy on Mama's bed?

1659
01:43:19,009 --> 01:43:20,271
I remember.

1660
01:43:20,444 --> 01:43:21,911
Well...

1661

"The world is out of shape,"
he said, "when there are hungry men."

1663
01:43:29,386 --> 01:43:34,847
And until it gets in shape,
men will steal and lie...

...and kill.

1665

But for whatever reason it's done,
and whoever does it...

1666
