1
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:23,151
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, slow it down.

2
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:29,658
Dear Mr. And Mrs. Andrews.

3
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:31,492
Mr. And Mrs. Baldwin.

4
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:33,532
Dear Lieutenant
and Mrs. Franks.

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,261
Dear Mr. And Mrs. Peterson.

6
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:37,394
Dear Mr. And Mrs. Lupo.

7
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,462
I'm sure you've never received
a letter of this nature before,

8
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,303
and I'm also quite sure
you'll be surprised

9
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,640
by the circumstances
under which I'm writing it.

10
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:48,476
My name is Alex Chivescu,
and I'm a junior,

11
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,039
soon to be a senior at
Eagle Creek High School

12
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:52,584
in Rochester Hills.

13
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,455
My parents moved to Michigan
to go to college here,

14
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:03,018
they divorced when
I was two years old

15
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:06,065
and I have not heard
from my father since.

16
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:08,293
My mother is a nurturing
and caring person

17
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:11,826
who inspired my love
of learning.

18
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,668
This paper says
you're a doctor.

19
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,833
Well, sort of.

20
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,070
This is more
than a piece of paper, Alex,

21
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:20,009
this is why I came
to this country.

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,843
It's why I've studied
so hard.

23
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:25,282
Education is like a magic key
to open any door.

24
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,945
With it, anything is possible.

25
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:31,047
Can I go to a school
like this someday too?

26
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:33,957
Absolutely, absolutely.

27
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:38,555
Your education is going
to be even better than mine.

28
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:42,761
You'll go to a great university
like... Harvard.

29
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,326
Is Harvard the best?

30
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:45,871
The very best.

31
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,372
Then that's where I'll go.

32
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,498
You'll have to work hard.

33
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:50,634
I will, I promise.

34
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,178
You'll see.

35
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:54,804
You make me so proud.

36
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,377
So proud.

37
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,361
Perfect,
what do you think?

38
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,407
I think I want one too.

39
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,704
You can get a head
start on that.

40
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,801
You do your homework
while I make us some dinner.

41
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,478
Okay.

42
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:31,506
You hungry?

43
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:32,744
Yes, I'm starving.

44
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,979
Good.

45
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,296
Um, my teacher said you wanted
to see me, Mrs. Thomas?

46
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,166
Yes, Alex, you know your
mother's friend Miss Carson?

47
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:52,169
Hi, Miss Carson.

48
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:54,399
Hi, Alex, why don't
you have a seat?

49
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:07,414
Alex, I'm sorry to have to be
the one to tell you this,

50
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,387
your mom's been
in a car accident.

51
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,082
She's in the hospital.

52
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,060
But she's got good doctors
taking care of her

53
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,824
and I'm sure she's
going to be fine.

54
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,034
Can I see her?

55
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:34,502
Can I go in?

56
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,276
Not yet, hon.

57
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,839
They'll be moving her
to a regular room

58
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:40,715
in a couple of days and you
can talk to her then, okay?

59
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:46,724
Is she gonna be okay?

60
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,590
She's going to
be fine.

61
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:52,387
Come on, in you get.

62
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:58,834
You know, Alex, we can visit
your mom as much as you want

63
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,532
once she's out of
intensive care.

64
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,632
Would you like that?

65
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,768
Okay, good night.

66
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:06,209
I'll see you
in the morning.

67
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:11,643
Miss Carson?

68
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,208
Yeah?

69
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,846
Could you leave a light on,
please?

70
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,719
Of course I can, honey.

71
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,757
It's going to be okay, Alex,
you'll see.

72
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:37,275
Okay, I bought some groceries,
made soup and casseroles;

73
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:38,776
you won't have to cook
for a while.

74
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,870
Oh, thanks, Ellen,
you've been so helpful,

75
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,074
especially with Alex.

76
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,548
Here, have a seat.

77
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,380
All right.

78
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,955
Would you like me to stay
with you and Alex tonight?

79
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,015
No, we're fine.

80
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:55,355
You sure?

81
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,896
It's okay.

82
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,228
You be a good boy and take
care of your mom.

83
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,790
I will.

84
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,263
You know what?

85
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,101
I'm going to make you
some tea before I go.

86
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:08,105
Want to help me, Alex?

87
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:09,937
- Sure.
- Okay.

88
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:27,057
My mother suffered
a serious head injury

89
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:30,823
from a car accident and
developed bipolar disorder.

90
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,491
When she was on her medication,
she was able to work

91
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:37,297
as a professor and things
were mostly normal.

92
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,497
But the medication
had harsh side effects.

93
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:44,035
The drugs made it harder
for her to think clearly.

94
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,203
Mom, I'm home.

95
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,874
She hated that so she
stopped taking them.

96
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:50,973
Mom?

97
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,847
Then she spiraled down,
couldn't work,

98
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,978
and became neglectful
and abusive.

99
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:56,715
Mom, I got my report card.

100
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,492
Are you okay?

101
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:09,160
I have a headache, Alex,
leave me alone.

102
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,565
Okay.

103
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,205
I'll leave it here so you
can sign it later.

104
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:40,788
Have a seat, Alex.

105
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,368
Your mom had to go back
to the hospital.

106
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,304
What?

107
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:49,432
What happened?

108
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,773
She just had a little setback,

109
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:53,937
but the doctors are taking
really good care of her

110
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,311
and she'll be home
as soon as possible.

111
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,907
Now this is Mrs. Edenger.

112
00:06:58,985 --> 00:06:59,974
Hi.

113
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:02,145
Hello, Alex,
nice to meet you.

114
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:03,848
Nice to meet you too.

115
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,823
I'm from Child Protective
Services.

116
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,723
Do you know what that is?

117
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,627
Well, we find nice people
to take care of children

118
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,493
when their parents can't.

119
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,464
So while your mom
is in the hospital...

120
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,664
you'll stay with a family
who live near here.

121
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,938
Why can't I stay
with Miss Carson?

122
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,205
Well, she won't be able
to take care of you

123
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,974
for as long as your
mom is going to be

124
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,105
in the hospital this time.

125
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:38,456
See, this isn't so bad.

126
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:40,321
Please don't make me
stay here.

127
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:43,021
It's just for a few weeks, 'til
your mom gets better, okay?

128
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:44,084
Please don't make me!

129
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:46,996
Alex, I need you to be
a big boy.

130
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:50,160
Let's just sit down
right here.

131
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:54,263
I've got to go
and talk to your foster mom.

132
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,308
Maybe you can unpack
your suitcase.

133
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:08,784
I'll come check on you
sometime next week, okay?

134
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,585
It's going to be okay, Alex.

135
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,802
When my mother was
taken away from me

136
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:29,637
I felt alone, abandoned,

137
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:33,611
and I was terrified that I
would never see her again.

138
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,237
I will never forget
the first time

139
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:38,909
I was put in a strange home
with people I didn't know.

140
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,044
Days felt like weeks,

141
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,453
a month without my mom
felt like a lifetime.

142
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,185
Mom!

143
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:49,725
Please don't leave me
again, Mom.

144
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:51,786
Please!

145
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,298
I'll try not to.

146
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,631
I'll do my best,
okay?

147
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,899
There were times when my mother
returned from the hospital

148
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,440
that I thought I had
my life back,

149
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:04,703
but it never lasted for long.

150
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,870
Mom, come on,
it's Christmas!

151
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,212
Mom, come on!

152
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,412
Mom!

153
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:20,225
Mom?

154
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,727
Can you leave me
alone please?

155
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:25,389
But it's Christmas, Mom.

156
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,659
I have a present
for you.

157
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,394
I made it myself.

158
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:30,628
Please not now.

159
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,713
My mother struggled constantly
with the symptoms

160
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,305
of her condition

161
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:46,749
and the harsh side effects of
the drugs she had to take.

162
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:49,049
Even when I was home
with my mom

163
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,419
it often felt like she wasn't
really there.

164
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,665
Mom.

165
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:07,671
Mom?

166
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,139
Can't you see I'm looking
for a job?

167
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,438
I need some lunch money.

168
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,444
Your lunch is supposed
to be free.

169
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:16,675
You didn't fill out that paper
I brought home from school.

170
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,649
I can't get free lunch
until you do that.

171
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:19,844
I'll do it later.

172
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,352
What about lunch today?

173
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:29,923
There!

174
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,088
That's all I can do!

175
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:33,723
I don't have a job,
I don't have money!

176
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,277
There was never enough money,

177
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,676
and I always worried that
we'd have enough food

178
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:50,238
or that my mom would be
able to pay our rent.

179
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,812
It wasn't easy, but I learned
to fend for myself.

180
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:07,324
Open this door!

181
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,492
Do you hear me?

182
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,000
This is what I get for taking
care of you

183
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,799
and feeding you,
devoting my life to you?!

184
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:13,998
I pay the rent here!

185
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:16,132
You open this door
right now!

186
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,505
I'm going to kick it in, Alex.

187
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,009
If you don't open
this door right now

188
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,807
you're going to be so sorry!

189
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,642
Hey!

190
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,616
Hey, what's going on
in there?

191
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,946
What?

192
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,714
Look, lady, how many times do
I have to come down here?

193
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,655
If you don't keep it down,
I'm gonna call the police.

194
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:37,252
You don't have to do this,
let me go back to my apartment.

195
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,729
I'll... I'll calm down.

196
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,460
I'll be fine, okay?

197
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,832
Just let me...

198
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,427
Please...

199
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:46,562
I don't want to go.

200
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,402
I... I... I can't do this.

201
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,567
I'll be okay.

202
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:54,443
Oh, there's my son,
don't put in front of him.

203
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:03,283
My mother was taken away
from me many times.

204
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:06,188
Sometimes my mom was
taken away for weeks,

205
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,419
other times for months.

206
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:11,156
She'd be hospitalized
and put on medication

207
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,597
and I'd end up living
with strangers again.

208
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,295
After a while,
she'd return to stability

209
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,496
and I'd be placed
back in her care,

210
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,062
but it always felt precarious.

211
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,800
I lived in fear

212
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:30,281
because I knew that a life with
my mother could never last.

213
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,544
Before long,
she'd go off her medication

214
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:35,485
and everything would
fall apart again.

215
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,322
I felt bad for my mom

216
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,654
because she couldn't
take care of herself

217
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:42,660
let alone take care of me.

218
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:47,989
When I was 16

219
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,557
I left my latest foster home

220
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,967
and returned to live
with my mother.

221
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:54,835
Fortunately for me,
our apartment was located

222
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,239
in the Eagle Creek
High School district,

223
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:58,742
one of the best in the state.

224
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,617
It wasn't easy
coming in as a junior

225
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:13,283
after the semester
had already started.

226
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,123
Your transcript is certainly
impressive, Alex.

227
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:22,133
I mean, one point below
a perfect score on your ACT.

228
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,862
Wow!

229
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,404
I mean, considering how many
schools you've attended,

230
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,498
your GPA is especially
remarkable.

231
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:32,635
Yeah, I, ah, I moved a lot.

232
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:34,235
Well, you keep this up and
you're well on your way

233
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,247
to getting into a top school.

234
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,010
Any idea where you'd
like to go?

235
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,880
Harvard.

236
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:45,947
Well, that's a lofty goal,
but one I think you can reach.

237
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,427
Now, look, you're going to have
to keep up your grades.

238
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,019
I will.

239
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,257
I made a promise.

240
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,527
Okay then.

241
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,660
I'll do my best to help you
keep that promise.

242
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,105
That needs to be
much better.

243
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,740
This is a nice start.

244
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,350
Exceptional work, Alex.

245
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,017
- You need to buck up.
- He got an "A."

246
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:25,893
All right, people, listen up.

247
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:30,026
The midterm assignment for this
semester is a 50-page paper

248
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:33,503
on an aspect about government
that you will choose.

249
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,434
Okay, okay, don't worry.

250
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,875
You can work in groups
of up to three people.

251
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:47,645
Hey, new kid.

252
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,620
Nice work in Rowe's class.

253
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:52,486
- That guy never gives an "A."
- Yeah, it's like his thing.

254
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,958
An "A" represents perfection,

255
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:57,018
and I've never seen
a perfect paper.

256
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,087
I'm Lucy, this is Danny.

257
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,426
Alex.

258
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:01,796
We were wondering
if you wanted to work

259
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,596
on the midterm with us?

260
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:04,863
Really?

261
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,871
Yeah, I mean Danny here is
a straight "C" student

262
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,065
so he'll be tons of help.

263
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,801
Hey, you should
talk, Picasso.

264
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,274
All she cares about
is art and poetry.

265
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,277
Social studies isn't her thing.

266
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:14,835
You can see what you'd be
getting yourself into.

267
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,643
I mean, neither one
of us is a brain like you.

268
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:19,377
Not a problem, when do
you want to start?

269
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:22,045
Do you want to meet at my house
on Saturday, 10:00?

270
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,145
10:00?

271
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:25,190
You know I sleep 'til noon
on Saturday.

272
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,383
Fine, 11:00.

273
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,254
Alex?

274
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,623
Sounds good.

275
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:30,628
Okay, but I'm going to be in
a coma for the first hour.

276
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,129
You're always in a coma.

277
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,823
Eagle Creek High
became everything to me.

278
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,869
I immersed myself in studies

279
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,633
and found compassion and
support from my new friends.

280
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,771
When chaos reigned at home,

281
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:46,504
the school became
a refuge for me.

282
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,390
Mom?

283
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,225
What are you doing?

284
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,730
I'm sick of these medications,

285
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,790
the side effects are
making me worse!

286
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:12,064
I can't focus,
my... my head is throbbing.

287
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,570
- I can't think!
- Stop it.

288
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,799
Please!

289
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:16,306
- Mom!
- It hurts!

290
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,933
But you know what happens
when you stop taking them!

291
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,875
I don't care anymore!

292
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:54,737
We really lucked out
with you, Alex,

293
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:56,576
we might actually do
all right on this paper.

294
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:58,047
We're going to get an "A."

295
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,709
You sound pretty sure
of yourself.

296
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,309
We have to.

297
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,719
I've got to maintain a 4.0
to have any chance

298
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:04,915
at getting into Harvard.

299
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,184
Harvard?

300
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,350
Right, and I'm going
to play shortstop

301
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:08,825
for the Detroit Tigers.

302
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:11,021
So you think
I'm delusional?

303
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:11,858
Yeah.

304
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,295
I don't.

305
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,799
I'm 1,000% positive
you can do it.

306
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:25,407
Mom?

307
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:26,876
I'm home!

308
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,495
Mom, there's no food!

309
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:39,645
I'm gonna get going,

310
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:42,050
my mom and I are going
to an art show.

311
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:46,381
Whoa, check this out,
crazy lady, 9:00.

312
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,823
Alex!

313
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,417
What are you doing here?

314
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:50,792
You should be home!

315
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:51,921
I've been looking everywhere
for you!

316
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:53,658
Why do I have to track
you down?

317
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,927
I had to come all the way
over here, why?

318
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:57,127
Calm down.

319
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:58,726
You don't tell me what
classes you're taking

320
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,271
or what you're doing
after school!

321
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,237
Nothing!

322
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,637
Mom, don't do this to me,
please!

323
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,767
Don't you dare tell me what
to do, I'm your mother.

324
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,470
You respect me!

325
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,012
Ah, excuse me, Mrs. Nistor?

326
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,344
Ah, did you stop by the office
and get a visitor's pass?

327
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:11,404
What?

328
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,472
No.

329
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,384
I'm sorry,
it's school policy.

330
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,115
Wanna come with me?

331
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,713
You wanna come?

332
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,206
Alex, wait!

333
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:39,266
Leave me alone!

334
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,437
Alex, please can
you talk to me?

335
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,605
There's nothing
to talk about!

336
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,514
My mom is crazy, okay?

337
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,415
Well, what's wrong with her?

338
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:51,183
Well, she's sick,
and she can't help it.

339
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:54,987
We can't afford insurance so
she can't get good treatment.

340
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,584
They hospitalize her
when it's a crisis

341
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,926
and when she's on her own,
she just can't cope.

342
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,625
If you knew what she
used to be like

343
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,330
before she got sick...

344
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:10,602
She has a PhD.

345
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:14,407
It kills her when her mind
can't function the way it did.

346
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:19,777
That must be really hard
for her, and you.

347
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:21,375
I think I know what
you're going through.

348
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,045
Oh, I doubt that.

349
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,251
My father's a
recovering alcoholic.

350
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:31,490
Before he got sober, he was
completely unpredictable.

351
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,123
- Sorry, Lucy, I had no idea.
- It's okay, he's good.

352
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,895
He's in a program and
he's doing really great.

353
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:39,437
He's my dad again.

354
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,541
What are you going to do
about your mom?

355
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,044
I don't know.

356
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:51,515
I mean, I want to save her,
but I don't know how.

357
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,514
Sounds pretty stupid,
huh?

358
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,919
No, it sounds heroic.

359
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,432
What happened?

360
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,936
I'm sorry, Alex, your mother
couldn't pay the rent.

361
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:15,735
You've been evicted.

362
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:18,298
- Where is she?
- Hospitalized.

363
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,277
She went off her meds again!

364
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:21,744
I told her she's got
to keep taking them

365
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:22,973
but she won't listen.

366
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,606
I found an emergency
foster home for you.

367
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:26,116
Great, my fourth!

368
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:28,084
Well, hopefully your mom will
stabilize in a couple of weeks.

369
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:29,347
Aww, what's the point?

370
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:30,513
She'll just go off her meds,
go crazy and wind up

371
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:31,681
right back in the hospital!

372
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,054
I understand how frustrated
you must be.

373
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,854
- No, you don't!
- Yes, I do!

374
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,854
Now, I've made arrangements
for someone to come

375
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,058
and take these
into storage, okay?

376
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,761
Just pick out a couple things
that you need

377
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,360
and I will take you to
your foster placement.

378
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:57,514
My mom was always being
taken away from me.

379
00:21:57,582 --> 00:22:00,244
And while my social worker
helped keep me fed,

380
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,287
clothed and sheltered,

381
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:06,154
the cycle of instability
started to take a toll.

382
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:13,097
For six years I had been
in and out of foster homes,

383
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:17,431
my mom in and out
of hospitals.

384
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:20,437
I kept telling myself that
someday she'd get better,

385
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:24,236
be like her old self again
and stay that way,

386
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:27,039
but I finally had
to face reality;

387
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:28,511
it just wasn't going
to happen.

388
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:32,841
If anything was going
to change

389
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:36,046
it would be up to me
to change it.

390
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:38,851
I just, I can't take it
anymore.

391
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:43,224
The depression, the rants,
the constant uncertainty.

392
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:46,458
Nobody should have
to live like that.

393
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,466
What exactly are you
asking, Alex?

394
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,832
I'm asking to terminate
my mom's parental rights.

395
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:57,065
I have the right do
that now, I'm 16.

396
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:00,202
Do you fully understand
what that means?

397
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:01,575
Means that I don't
have to be afraid

398
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:03,307
of her hurting herself anymore.

399
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,748
Or me.

400
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:08,047
It doesn't mean
I don't love her.

401
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:14,216
Let's begin.

402
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:18,729
Alex, these attorneys are here
representing your mother.

403
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:20,230
The court doesn't allow her
to be present

404
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:21,663
during your testimony

405
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:25,726
so that you may speak
freely and honestly.

406
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,738
Do you understand?

407
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,676
Very well, let's proceed.

408
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:35,008
Alex, explain to Judge Brady
why it is

409
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,049
you want your mother's
rights to be terminated.

410
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:43,887
Please believe me,
Your Honor,

411
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:47,755
this was the hardest decision
I've ever had to make.

412
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:49,555
I love my mother;

413
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:52,620
she was a role-model
for me when I was little.

414
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:55,996
I got my curiosity and love
of learning from her.

415
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:58,092
But she's a very
different person now

416
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:02,197
and if I'm put back in her
custody, the circus will go on.

417
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,502
The circus?

418
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:06,703
The craziness.

419
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,008
Being evicted
from our apartment,

420
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,014
not having enough food,

421
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:14,074
police being called by neighbors
because of her screaming,

422
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:15,881
going in and out
of foster homes.

423
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:20,823
Do you understand
what this means, legally?

424
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:23,383
Yes, ma'am.

425
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,954
It means that,
according to the law,

426
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:28,499
I won't have a mother anymore.

427
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,853
Alex... how could
you do this?

428
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:08,264
I'm sorry, Mom.

429
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,528
Well, your mother's testimony
didn't help her case.

430
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:43,370
The judge has granted
termination of parental rights.

431
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:45,170
You won.

432
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:47,404
No, I didn't.

433
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,310
Nobody won.

434
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,027
You're 16, Alex,

435
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:08,555
finding a permanent placement
for a teenager, I'm sorry.

436
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:10,931
You'll be living here now.

437
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:12,162
What about school?

438
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,636
Well, you can stay
at Eagle Creek.

439
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:17,197
Umm, the orphanage has a driver
who will transport you

440
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:20,938
and the school district
will reimburse them.

441
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:23,276
So I guess it's official now.

442
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,009
What?

443
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,880
I don't have a family anymore.

444
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:43,934
All right, here's an
information packet.

445
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:50,007
As long as you accept all the
rules here, you'll do just fine.

446
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:51,474
Rules?

447
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:55,309
There's no fighting, no loud
music, lights out at 10:00.

448
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,247
But I usually stay up
studying later than that.

449
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:00,216
Well, you'll have to have your
homework done by 10:00.

450
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:04,551
I have five or six hours
of homework a night.

451
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:08,457
Well, we could possibly
make an exception.

452
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:10,084
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

453
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:13,991
It says here we're not allowed
to have a checking account.

454
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,225
That's correct.

455
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,995
But I need mine so I have
a safe place to keep

456
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,968
what I earn from my job
at the bookstore.

457
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:21,028
No, no, no, no, you're not
allowed to have a job, son.

458
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:27,934
I've never lived in an
institution like this before.

459
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:30,777
This is different for me,
but maybe I'm different

460
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:33,181
from the kids you're
used to dealing with.

461
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:35,185
I work hard and
I'm highly motivated,

462
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:37,619
I'm saving money
for college.

463
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:39,020
Don't you want kids
to come out of here

464
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,455
and go on to make something
of themselves?

465
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:43,858
That's what
I'm trying to do.

466
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:47,091
All right, but that does
not mean you are free

467
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,531
to come and go as you please.

468
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:51,535
Okay.

469
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:54,128
Oh, one more thing, do
you have a cell phone?

470
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:55,502
Yes, sir.

471
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:58,508
All right, hand it over, you're
not allowed to keep that.

472
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:00,737
But I won't be able to stay
in touch with my friends.

473
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:03,975
Well, it's a security issue.

474
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,448
Phone please.

475
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,294
Hi.

476
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:31,401
I'm Alex Chivescu.

477
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:32,602
What kind of name is that?

478
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:34,440
Romanian.

479
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:39,108
But I was born here
so I'm American.

480
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:41,209
Yeah, I was born here too,

481
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,311
people still call me Mexican.

482
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,842
Hey, hop in, Alex.

483
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,275
How do you know
my name?

484
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:09,472
Oh, I've heard all about you.

485
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:11,606
- You have?
- Hmm, let's just say

486
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,844
you don't exactly fit
the profile around here,

487
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,613
you know what I'm saying?

488
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:22,555
Listen, this is a long drive
to Eagle Creek.

489
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:24,595
Why don't you hop up front
here with me?

490
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:30,767
All right, buckle up,
my man.

491
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:38,006
By the way, I'm Henry.

492
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:46,282
Can you let me out here?

493
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:47,818
Well, we're not
at your school yet.

494
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:49,581
That's okay,
this is good.

495
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,201
Your friends don't know
where you're living, do they?

496
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,862
No.

497
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:13,144
Okay, well, I'll pick you back
up here after then.

498
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:15,702
That would be great,
can you come at 5:00?

499
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,077
Sure thing,
5:00 it is.

500
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,445
Thanks, Henry.

501
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:27,121
Wooo!

502
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:29,490
Check it out,
we got an "A."

503
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,051
That's capital "A," baby!

504
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:32,687
Thanks to Alex.

505
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:33,958
We should celebrate.

506
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:35,897
Do you guys want to come
to my house and order pizza?

507
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:36,899
I can't.

508
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:39,801
I have something to do.

509
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,566
I'll catch you
guys later.

510
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:43,834
Later, dude.

511
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:47,241
Ahh, my first "A"!

512
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:48,438
I love that guy.

513
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,775
Oh, my God.

514
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,118
Hey, Henry, thanks
for picking me up.

515
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:11,762
It's so stupid!

516
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:13,133
I hate this crap.

517
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,069
I mean, who cares
about "X"s and "Y"s?

518
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:16,834
What's the point?

519
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:21,404
You know, it's really not that
hard once you get the basics.

520
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,572
Yeah, well, I'm never
gonna get it!

521
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:29,183
What, you win all these?

522
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:31,085
Yeah.

523
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:32,918
What's this one for?

524
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:35,289
It's a National Merit
Scholarship.

525
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,691
And what's that?

526
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:40,253
It means I get a scholarship for
$2,500 when I go to college.

527
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:43,232
2,500 bucks?

528
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:44,233
What if you don't go?

529
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:45,394
Do you get to keep
the money?

530
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:48,906
No, but I'm definitely
going to college.

531
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:51,271
Man, kids like us don't go
to college.

532
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:53,401
I will.

533
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:54,911
My mom told me
a long time ago

534
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:59,973
that education was like a key
that could open any door.

535
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:03,179
What are you,
some kind of brain?

536
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:06,382
Yeah, I guess.

537
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:10,291
I mean, I could help you.

538
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:11,919
I tutor kids at school
to make extra money,

539
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:15,932
I'd tutor you for free.

540
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,163
And why would
you do that, huh?

541
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,039
Make sure I don't
beat you up?

542
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:30,537
Yo, I'm just messing
with you, man!

543
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,310
Yo, I could tell you
was kinda scared!

544
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:33,873
Yeah, well.

545
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,647
Hey, man, I can't
have guys thinking

546
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,951
I'm an easy target, you know?

547
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:40,650
You wanna have a look
at that equation?

548
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:41,783
Not really.

549
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:44,327
Come on, I'll show you.

550
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:46,454
Open it up.

551
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:49,890
Where'd you start?

552
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,129
It's right over here,
right?

553
00:32:52,603 --> 00:33:02,478
Look what
I ran across today,

554
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:03,411
"A Tale of Two Cities."

555
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:04,641
You remember?

556
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:06,946
You used to read this to me
when I was little.

557
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:12,851
"It was the best of times,

558
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:15,415
"it was
the worst of times,

559
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,051
"it was the age of wisdom,

560
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:18,925
"it was the age of
foolishness,

561
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,464
it was the epoch of belief..."

562
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:29,070
I've been in the system
since I was five,

563
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,404
how 'bout you?

564
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,273
Since I was 10.

565
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,574
Newbie.

566
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:38,877
So, what's the deal
with your parents?

567
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,683
Dad gone, mom crazy.

568
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:43,948
Same as me, man.

569
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,751
We could be brothers.

570
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:51,494
Your dad's not around either?

571
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:52,790
Hell no.

572
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,059
I don't even know
who my dad is.

573
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:58,068
So why is your mom crazy?

574
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:01,503
She's a crackhead,
your mom on dope too?

575
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:03,096
No.

576
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:05,540
What's so funny?

577
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:09,876
It's just being on drugs
makes your mom crazy, right?

578
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:11,744
Not being on drugs
makes my mom crazy.

579
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,613
I don't get it.

580
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:14,776
She's sick.

581
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:18,720
She needs medication
but she hates taking it.

582
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,690
That sucks.

583
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,725
All right, 8 ball
corner pocket.

584
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:26,423
All right, pressure's on.

585
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,264
Oh, I'm so good.

586
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:36,602
Now who's going to school,
professor?

587
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:37,800
Rack 'em up.

588
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:39,103
- Fight, fight!
- Take him!

589
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:40,644
- Yeah, yeah!
- You got him, you got him!

590
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:41,609
Good!

591
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,080
Fight, fight, fight!

592
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,411
Come on, man, you're
on top of him!

593
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:48,076
Fight, fight, fight, fight!

594
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:49,084
Come on, come on!

595
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:50,882
Carlos, what are you
doing, man?

596
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,820
- Let him go!
- What's going on?

597
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,484
That's enough, get up!

598
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,425
Hey, that's enough!

599
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:59,122
Back up!

600
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:00,630
Now you know the rules!

601
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:02,222
Carlos, I warned you
about this.

602
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,232
But he was trying
to steal...

603
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:05,633
No, no, no, no, no,
no excuses.

604
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:09,002
Both of you get
to my office.

605
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:10,267
Now!

606
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:18,571
Carlos!

607
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:19,775
What's going on?

608
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,079
They're kicking me out,
sending me someplace

609
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:22,779
with more supervision.

610
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:23,980
Probably be some
kind of lockdown.

611
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:26,182
- No, they can't do that.
- It's my third fight.

612
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:28,225
That jerk Feldman won't
even listen to my side.

613
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,055
All he cares about
is the rules

614
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,857
so I told him what he could
do with his stupid rules.

615
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:33,658
Ahh, Carlos!

616
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:37,929
I'm gonna
miss you, bro.

617
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:39,492
I'm gonna miss you, too.

618
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,435
Won't be missing your
algebra lessons, though.

619
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:42,803
Stick with it,
you can do it.

620
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:44,739
- Yeah, right.
- I mean it!

621
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,037
Don't give up.

622
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,839
Don't you give up either.

623
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:49,345
Harvard?

624
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:51,005
Man, that's gonna be cool.

625
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,177
Hey, man, check it out.

626
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:24,680
My dad let me borrow
the car.

627
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:26,774
Why don't you hop in,
we can give you a ride.

628
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:27,476
Oh, that's okay.

629
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:28,780
I've already got a ride.

630
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,480
All right.

631
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:50,934
Your friends?

632
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:53,476
Yeah.

633
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,943
I'm sorry, Alex.

634
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:11,761
Hi, Alex.

635
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:13,922
Something wrong?

636
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,259
Is it my mom?

637
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:21,498
Your mom's okay.

638
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,767
But I'm afraid we have
some bad news.

639
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:25,706
Due to budget cuts, the
school district can't afford

640
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:28,267
to transport you here
next year.

641
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:30,576
And I've spoken to the director
at Mercy Point

642
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:33,242
and unfortunately they
cannot cover the costs

643
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:35,217
of driving you either.

644
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:36,776
What does that mean?

645
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:38,412
Where will I go to school
for my senior year?

646
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:40,923
You'll have to attend a high
school closer to the orphanage.

647
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,152
No!

648
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:44,387
My counselors, teachers
and friends are all here!

649
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:45,690
Alex, I am sorry...

650
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,628
Don't you understand?!

651
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:49,529
This school is the only real
home I've ever known

652
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,067
and now it's being
taken away, too.

653
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:52,227
It's not fair!

654
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:53,827
Alex!

655
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:05,808
I'm sorry, Alex.

656
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:07,942
I tried, I really tried.

657
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,884
Apparently there's some rule
against me driving you

658
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,444
on company time.

659
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:14,047
That's not fair, Henry!

660
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:17,322
Changing schools, it could
keep me out of Harvard!

661
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:19,761
Man, that school was
everything to me.

662
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:20,888
I know how you must feel.

663
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,523
No, you don't!

664
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,965
You have no idea
how it feels,

665
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:25,502
I've worked so hard
for so long

666
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:26,627
and now you're just going
to take this away...

667
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:28,365
You just hold on!

668
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:30,498
Now maybe I didn't
go to college.

669
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:33,270
Hell, I didn't even graduate
from the 8th grade,

670
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:36,006
but I sure know what it feels
like to be disappointed!

671
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,877
And I know what it
feels like, Alex,

672
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:41,145
to have something
taken away from me.

673
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:42,685
I'm sorry.

674
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:44,721
Henry, I didn't mean
to take it out on you.

675
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:46,017
Yeah, you did.

676
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:50,390
Now you may be
all book smart

677
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:52,053
but you sure ain't
people smart.

678
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:55,963
It's just that's all I have.

679
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:59,059
Listen, that's not true.

680
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:01,161
That's not true,
you got friends.

681
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:03,604
You got people
who care about you.

682
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:06,472
You know,
I might not be much,

683
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:07,909
but you got me, too.

684
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,618
Come on, let's get out
of here.

685
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:32,394
It's just I don't know
what to do, Henry.

686
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:35,871
They're taking school
away from me.

687
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,376
Listen, man, you got a good
head on your shoulders,

688
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:41,240
so think.

689
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,611
You can come up
with a plan.

690
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:47,048
Use those famous smarts of
yours for something other than

691
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:52,556
trying to keep people
from getting close to you.

692
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:53,749
Think, man.

693
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,753
You're right.

694
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,957
Social services is
never going to help me.

695
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:04,557
Maybe not.

696
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:05,761
Come on, let's get back.

697
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:07,235
What's the rush?

698
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:08,396
You going to make me
drive, Henry?

699
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:09,996
Come on, let's go!

700
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,371
Come on!

701
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:12,739
All right.

702
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,955
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
slow it down.

703
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:46,706
You've reached Mrs. Edenger
at children's welfare,

704
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,938
please leave a message.

705
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:52,312
Mrs. Edenger,
it's me, Alex.

706
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:53,543
I just wanted you to know
that I'm through

707
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,642
waiting for you to
find a family for me.

708
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,118
I'm going to find
one myself.

709
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,612
I'm sure you've never received
a letter of this nature before

710
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,545
and I'm also quite sure
you'll be surprised

711
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:26,173
at the circumstances
under which...

712
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,309
My mother is a nurturing
and caring person

713
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:29,818
who inspired my love
of learning...

714
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:31,684
I understand it
is a great emotional

715
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:34,485
and financial burden to take
a 17-year-old into your home...

716
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:36,253
...straight "A"s,

717
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,192
advanced-placement college
classes

718
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:39,661
and a strong desire...

719
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,459
My most fervent dream
is to be accepted

720
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:42,863
into Harvard University.

721
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:44,025
You have no commitment to me

722
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:47,229
after I graduate from
high school next year...

723
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:49,795
...fail to respond to
my urgent and dire...

724
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:52,900
...as of now I am a ward
of the state...

725
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:56,242
My social worker has kept me
fed, clothed and sheltered

726
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:58,838
but she doesn't understand how
desperately I want to stay

727
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:00,975
in the same school
for senior year

728
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:04,043
where the counselors who know me
will help me apply to colleges,

729
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:05,554
where the teachers who
know me will help me

730
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:08,649
write letters of
recommendation and advise me

731
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:11,456
and where my friends will be
there to support me.

732
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,987
I'm a good kid in
a bad circumstance.

733
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:17,363
I need a home.

734
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:18,833
Thank you.

735
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:20,302
Alex Chivescu.

736
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:33,677
Hey, any replies
to your letter yet?

737
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:37,152
Yeah, all negative.

738
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:40,156
Look, there's something
I want to tell you, man.

739
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,658
I kinda asked my parents
if you could live with us

740
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,490
but they said no.

741
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,791
It's nothing personal.

742
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,991
It's just, y'know, they both
work such long hours.

743
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,933
It's okay, I understand.

744
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:53,094
Sorry.

745
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:55,001
Hey, don't be.

746
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,302
I asked my parents too.

747
00:42:57,374 --> 00:42:59,103
They actually
considered it but...

748
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:03,237
You guys, it means a lot
to me that you asked.

749
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:05,714
Thanks.

750
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,014
I got a letter
for you, bud.

751
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,970
Dear Alex, my wife and I were
deeply moved by your letter.

752
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:30,233
We'd like to meet you
and discuss

753
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:32,172
the possibility of
sharing our home.

754
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:33,504
Yes!

755
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:36,939
I made you some
chocolate chip cookies,

756
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:38,982
I hope you like them.

757
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:42,883
Wow, thank you, Mrs. Franks,
they sure look good.

758
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,944
They're our son Paul's
favorite.

759
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:47,786
He's at Camp Lesjune
for basic training.

760
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:51,817
Takes after me, I'm a
lieutenant in the US Army.

761
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:53,624
We live off base.

762
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:55,824
Our house is modest
but we have an extra room

763
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:59,733
now that Paul's gone.

764
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:03,102
Did you get a lot of responses
to your letter?

765
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:06,370
No, sir, only you
and Mrs. Franks.

766
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:08,411
And you can call us
Julia and Richard,

767
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,947
and don't you dare
call him sir.

768
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:12,175
We might be in the army

769
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:16,049
but we do not run our house
like a barracks.

770
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,452
Well, I'm sure you want
to know more about me.

771
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:23,283
Ever done drugs?

772
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,349
No, sir.

773
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:25,986
- Drink?
- No.

774
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:27,724
Been in trouble
with the law?

775
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:29,493
No.

776
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:33,733
That's all we need to know.

777
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:35,601
You mean that's it?

778
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,868
No more questions,
no thinking about it?

779
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:39,408
We took Paul in
as a foster child

780
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:41,637
and ended up adopting him,

781
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:45,273
we have no reservations
about taking you in, Alex.

782
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:48,375
Well, thank you, Mr. Franks,
Mrs. Franks.

783
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:52,354
I mean, Richard and Julia.

784
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:53,720
Wow.

785
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:00,229
All right, hustle up!

786
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:07,365
This will be the kind of home
I never had.

787
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:08,462
After everything
I've been through

788
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,507
it feels like I can
finally relax.

789
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:12,508
That's a good thing.

790
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:14,100
What if it's too good
to be true?

791
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:15,907
Don't overthink this,
Einstein.

792
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:18,573
Just let yourself be happy
for once.

793
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:20,048
You deserve it.

794
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:34,458
Hi, Alex.

795
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:35,930
Hi.

796
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:38,467
Mr. Feldman told me you
were here, is everything okay?

797
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:42,972
We stopped by because we
wanted to tell you in person,

798
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,634
I'm being transferred
to a base in New York.

799
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:47,142
We leave in two months.

800
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:48,405
Oh.

801
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:50,504
But we want you to come
with us.

802
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,912
You'd take me with you?

803
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:53,210
Of course.

804
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:55,843
You have a home with us
as long as you need it.

805
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,511
I don't know what to say.

806
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:00,785
Say yes.

807
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:04,453
I'm really grateful

808
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:06,792
but moving away would
defeat my whole purpose

809
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:09,560
and it's the reason
I wrote the letter.

810
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:15,071
I want... I need to stay here
and graduate from Eagle Creek,

811
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:16,265
and I can't leave my mom.

812
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,433
At least when I'm here,
I know she's nearby.

813
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:20,704
We understand.

814
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,905
Is there another family
you can stay with?

815
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:27,178
Oh, sure, definitely.

816
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:30,652
I am so sorry, Alex.

817
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:34,282
We really wanted this
to work out.

818
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:35,985
Good luck, son.

819
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:12,587
Bills, bill and bill,
there you go.

820
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:17,032
Do either of you know someone
by the name of Alex Chivescu?

821
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,328
Nope.

822
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:19,198
Who is he?

823
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:20,896
I don't know, let's find out.

824
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:27,409
Oh, goes to Eagle Creek High,
and he lives in an orphanage.

825
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:29,775
How sad.

826
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,508
He's looking for a foster
family to live with

827
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:33,379
during his senior year.

828
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,247
He's going to college
after that,

829
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:37,787
his father
is out of the picture

830
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,550
and his mother has
psychiatric issues

831
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:42,114
and lost custody of him?

832
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,160
We need to meet him, Mom.

833
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:45,525
- Jen.
- Mom.

834
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:47,325
Look, this isn't like
your stray dogs or cats

835
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:48,591
or wounded birds...

836
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:49,859
Or turtles.

837
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:51,423
Exactly, that you brought
home since you would walk.

838
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:53,162
I mean, this... we don't
even know this kid.

839
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:54,499
It's probably a scam.

840
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:56,630
Dad, can you imagine that the
guts that it took for him

841
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,197
to write this letter?

842
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:00,800
He's turning to total strangers
because he has nobody else.

843
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,743
You don't even
know him, Jen.

844
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:06,340
Well, I know that he's got to
feel scared and desperate.

845
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:10,375
I have you guys, this kid
doesn't have anyone.

846
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:14,288
We need to help him.

847
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:17,919
Bringing a stranger into
our home is serious business.

848
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:23,626
We need to learn
more about him

849
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,224
and then we can talk
about it.

850
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:26,667
All right.

851
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:30,431
I'm going to go check
if he's on Facebook

852
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:31,337
and add him as a friend.

853
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:32,875
Okay.

854
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:34,672
Our daughter has a very
big heart.

855
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,610
Yeah, well, I know where
she gets that from.

856
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,808
But, Suzanne, this has to be
a thoughtful discussion.

857
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:41,282
There's too much at stake
for our family

858
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:42,511
and for this young man.

859
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,951
I know.

860
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:45,579
He's on Facebook!

861
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:46,918
Let me see.

862
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:50,653
He's kind of a nerd in a nice
way but a total brain.

863
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:52,558
He looks friendly, Mom.

864
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:53,618
He does, Jim.

865
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:55,187
Oh.

866
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:57,324
So when can we meet him?

867
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:58,993
Now hold on, you two,
come on.

868
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:01,299
Dad, I'm going to be going
to college in the fall.

869
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:03,737
You and Mom are going
to be here all alone.

870
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:06,105
The empty-nest thing is going
to be really hard on you.

871
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:07,541
Or liberating.

872
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,045
No more loud music, no more
giggling girls at sleepovers.

873
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,047
Very funny.

874
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,049
I suppose we could just meet
the boy, Jim.

875
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:21,317
Yeah, I suppose we could.

876
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:22,551
Yay!

877
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:23,752
That's all I'm promising.

878
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:25,260
- Sure.
- Sure.

879
00:49:27,998 --> 00:49:30,159
Thanks.

880
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:31,928
I didn't realize I'd be
so nervous.

881
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:33,435
Me neither.

882
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:35,368
Mr. And Mrs. Bante?

883
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:38,203
Yes.

884
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:41,472
Alex, nice to meet you.

885
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:43,843
It's nice to
meet you, too.

886
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:45,609
You want to grab a seat?

887
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:46,478
Sure.

888
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,108
Okay.

889
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:49,652
Don't forget your coffee.

890
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:53,488
Well, Alex, we spoke
to your school counselor

891
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:55,491
and obviously you're
an excellent student

892
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:57,117
and that's just great.

893
00:49:57,194 --> 00:50:00,254
But Suzanne and I want to know
some more things about you.

894
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,959
Of course, sir, um, here.

895
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:07,162
Here's some of my awards,
my high school transcript,

896
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:08,602
and these are letters
of recommendation

897
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,799
from some of my teachers
and my social worker.

898
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:13,741
Alex, you're not applying
for a job.

899
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,175
If we do this,

900
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:19,238
we're not asking for you to
live with us for a year or so,

901
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:22,080
we're inviting you
into our home

902
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:26,987
to be part of our family,
permanently.

903
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:28,786
Permanently?

904
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,918
- That's right.
- Yeah.

905
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:33,485
So you really need
to think about that,

906
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:36,031
and so do we.

907
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:37,225
Okay?

908
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,927
Yeah.

909
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:55,508
Hello?

910
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:58,918
Yes, Mr. Bante.

911
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:01,924
Thank you, sir,
thank you very much.

912
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,985
I can be ready then.

913
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:07,997
Okay, okay, bye.

914
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:20,874
Hey, Alex, you almost
ready?

915
00:51:20,944 --> 00:51:22,138
We're parked out front.

916
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:23,179
I'm all packed.

917
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,338
Where are the rest
of your things?

918
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,143
I thought you said
you had a lot of stuff.

919
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:28,343
Well, this is it,
everything I own.

920
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:31,718
Okay.

921
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:33,653
Great, we'll
give you a hand.

922
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:40,420
Here I'll take that,
Alex.

923
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:41,930
We'll meet you in the car.

924
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:45,992
I don't know what to say,
Henry.

925
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:47,593
I wouldn't have made it
without you.

926
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:49,969
No need, my man,
this isn't goodbye.

927
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,200
You'll come and see me?

928
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,605
Of course!

929
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:56,305
Still gotta finish teaching you
how to drive.

930
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:05,254
Your parallel parking needs
a lot of work, you know.

931
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:07,187
I know.

932
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:15,328
Here we go.

933
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:22,871
Hey, Alex, it's nice
to finally meet you.

934
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:23,963
I'm Jen.

935
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,667
It's nice to
meet you too, Jen.

936
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:27,539
Come on, I'll show
you to your room...

937
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:29,476
actually it was my old room.

938
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:30,774
Well, I don't want to take
your room.

939
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,836
Oh, no, it's okay.

940
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:33,473
I moved into
the smaller guest room.

941
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:34,744
I leave for college
in a couple of weeks

942
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,581
so I won't be home
that much.

943
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,450
It will be your job to look
after my parents,

944
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:40,820
make sure they don't party
too hard.

945
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:50,099
Two years ago I was
diagnosed with Lupus.

946
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:53,136
I have flare-ups sometimes.

947
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:55,899
Last spring, I had this
really bad attack.

948
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:58,668
I had chest pains and
I couldn't breath,

949
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:01,939
and I collapsed on
the bathroom floor.

950
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,445
Must have been scared.

951
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,538
Oh, I was terrified.

952
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:07,913
Fortunately, my parents
found me right away

953
00:53:07,984 --> 00:53:10,646
and I had to go to the hospital
for like a "kazillion" tests

954
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,779
and my mom and my dad,
they never left my side.

955
00:53:15,091 --> 00:53:17,423
I can't imagine what
it's been like for you,

956
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:18,893
not having your parents around.

957
00:53:18,962 --> 00:53:21,487
I mean, it's just
the way it is.

958
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:23,624
I don't even remember
my dad,

959
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,600
but my mom was incredible.

960
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:27,466
Before she got sick
she was on her own,

961
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:30,665
raising a kid, somehow still
managed to get her PhD.

962
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:34,301
Well, now we know who you got
your brains from.

963
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:35,571
Yeah.

964
00:53:36,913 --> 00:53:39,211
Disturbed?

965
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:40,180
The Black Keys?

966
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,911
Sierra?

967
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:43,077
Okay, no way!

968
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:44,586
What?

969
00:53:44,654 --> 00:53:48,351
When it comes to music, we were
definitely separated at birth.

970
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:51,656
Oh, I wish I wasn't going
to college so soon;

971
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:54,856
you are going to be
a cool little brother.

972
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:57,559
Just don't be bratty.

973
00:53:57,634 --> 00:54:00,660
Deal, as long as you're
not bossy.

974
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,432
Hey!

975
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:04,029
Welcome to the family!

976
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:09,544
So don't worry about me,

977
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:12,514
'cause I found a really nice
foster family

978
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:16,211
and they have a daughter who
already feels like a sister.

979
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:18,846
I'm still working hard towards
getting into Harvard.

980
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,651
My counselor thinks
I can do it.

981
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,560
Remember when I made that
promise to you?

982
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,996
I'm going to keep it.

983
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:30,726
I miss you, Mom.

984
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,062
Love Alex.

985
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:44,244
Hey, there he is.

986
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:45,781
Good morning, Alex.

987
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:46,816
Morning.

988
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:48,077
Eggs and toast okay?

989
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:50,119
Thanks, Mrs. Bante.

990
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:52,984
You know, Alex, you don't have
to call us Mr. And Mrs. Bante.

991
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:54,648
What would you like me
to call you?

992
00:54:54,724 --> 00:54:56,214
I don't know,
Jim and Suzanne?

993
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,419
Whatever you're
comfortable with.

994
00:54:57,494 --> 00:54:58,586
Yeah.

995
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:00,789
Well, I'm comfortable
with Mr. And Mrs. Bante.

996
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:02,928
Okay.

997
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:05,126
Grab a seat, Alex.

998
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:12,373
We never had a chance
to talk about your chores.

999
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:13,602
Chores?

1000
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:15,577
Yeah, everyone pitches in here,

1001
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:18,614
so when Jen leaves for school,
you'll take over her jobs.

1002
00:55:18,682 --> 00:55:20,650
Well, what kind of jobs?

1003
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:23,015
Well, for example, today's
trash pick up day,

1004
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:24,815
so when you leave the house,
you'll put the cans out.

1005
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:25,855
When you come home
from school,

1006
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:27,048
you'll put them back
in the garage.

1007
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:29,921
We'll talk about the rest
later, I gotta run.

1008
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,324
Bye, honey.

1009
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:33,453
Bye.

1010
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:35,589
I will see you guys tonight.

1011
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:44,201
Scrambled?

1012
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:45,866
Ah, yes, please.

1013
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:47,341
Great.

1014
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:59,117
I can't take it,
it's too much.

1015
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:06,088
And a bunch of chores, too.

1016
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:07,493
And Mrs. Bante came
into my room,

1017
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:09,293
tried to get me to talk
to her.

1018
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:11,334
Well, imagine that.

1019
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:16,931
Okay.

1020
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:21,238
Remember to check
your side mirrors.

1021
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:25,708
She wants me to talk
about my feelings.

1022
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:27,272
So what's the problem?

1023
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:30,717
I don't know, they're not
my parents, you know?

1024
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:32,414
I wish they'd stop
acting like they are.

1025
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:34,081
Why?

1026
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:36,682
Because I don't need that.

1027
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,660
You don't need it,

1028
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:41,026
or you don't know
how to handle it?

1029
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:44,396
I wish they'd just let me
pay rent and leave me alone.

1030
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:46,697
Really, Alex?

1031
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:49,068
I mean, is that what
you really want?

1032
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:00,272
Hey, Alex,
how was school?

1033
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:01,715
Fine.

1034
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:03,878
Learn anything
interesting today?

1035
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:05,420
Not really.

1036
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:07,786
Can I have an apple?

1037
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:11,020
Alex, this is your home,
you don't have to ask.

1038
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,255
Y'know, when Jen was in senior
year all she wanted to do

1039
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:14,762
was bring her friends over
and...

1040
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:18,323
Mrs. Bante, I got lots
of homework to do.

1041
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:20,130
Yeah, sure, go ahead.

1042
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:33,675
Come in.

1043
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:38,381
Hey, Alex, I just wanted
to say good night.

1044
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,252
Good night, Mrs. Bante.

1045
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:46,152
Alex, I want you to know that
you're part of our family now

1046
00:57:46,229 --> 00:57:47,457
and the thing about
families is

1047
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:49,293
that we can talk
to each other.

1048
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:51,731
So if there's anything
you want to say...

1049
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:54,827
I'm fine, Mrs. Bante.

1050
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:56,804
Good.

1051
00:57:56,873 --> 00:57:58,170
But if you ever do want
to talk,

1052
00:57:58,241 --> 00:57:59,799
Jim and I are ready
to listen.

1053
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:07,773
Okay, um, all right,
good night.

1054
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:09,113
Night.

1055
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:13,884
It's a miracle he turned out
as well as he did.

1056
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:16,721
He doesn't know how to do
the most basic things

1057
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:19,819
and his social skills
definitely need some work.

1058
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:21,295
I think his upbringing
was a lot more difficult

1059
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:22,592
than we realized.

1060
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:23,962
Well, at least he
talks to you, Jim.

1061
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:25,500
He barely says a word
to me.

1062
00:58:25,568 --> 00:58:26,933
Don't take it personally,
honey.

1063
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:29,563
It's not about my feelings,
it's about his.

1064
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:32,506
I can only imagine what
it must be like for him.

1065
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:34,236
I just wish that he felt
safe enough with us

1066
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:36,835
to open up and share
what he's going through.

1067
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:38,175
Suzanne, he barely knows us

1068
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:41,376
and he definitely
doesn't trust us, not yet.

1069
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:43,885
Well, what if he never can?

1070
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:45,420
Well, that's up to him.

1071
00:58:45,488 --> 00:58:48,787
He'll let us past his defenses
or he won't.

1072
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:52,817
There has got to be something
we can do to help him.

1073
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:56,127
All we can do is treat
him like what he is,

1074
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:59,430
a member of this family.

1075
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:02,437
Jim, are we crazy to have
gotten into this?

1076
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:05,838
Probably, but no matter
how it turns out

1077
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:07,843
I'm not going to be
sorry that we tried.

1078
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:09,208
You?

1079
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:10,371
No.

1080
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:11,879
Good.

1081
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,551
Call us as soon as you
get there, okay?

1082
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:27,061
I will, Mom.

1083
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:28,688
And I know you're going to be
busy, but please stay in touch.

1084
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:30,528
Okay.

1085
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:35,237
Go.

1086
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:39,235
Keep an eye on them;

1087
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:40,833
don't let them get
into too much trouble.

1088
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,072
It will be okay.

1089
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:47,946
They're not the coolest parents
in the world

1090
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:49,484
but they'll be there
for you

1091
00:59:49,552 --> 00:59:51,816
just like they've
always been for me.

1092
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:56,957
Wouldn't ya know it.

1093
00:59:57,026 --> 00:59:58,789
I finally get a brother
and I have to leave.

1094
01:00:00,296 --> 01:00:02,025
Are you gonna miss me?

1095
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:03,087
Nah.

1096
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:05,361
Ha, very funny.

1097
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:06,402
See you at Christmas.

1098
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:07,800
See ya.

1099
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,553
But, Mr. Bante, I don't need
you to give me money

1100
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:29,751
to buy Christmas gifts.

1101
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:31,316
I don't want to be
a charity case.

1102
01:00:31,394 --> 01:00:34,158
Don't give me that, Alex,
you're not a charity case.

1103
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:36,664
Don't assume what people
feel for you is pity.

1104
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:39,258
It might actually be
something else.

1105
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:42,771
Alex, come here.

1106
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:44,170
Listen to me.

1107
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,105
I want to be clear here.

1108
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:49,542
You've had a rough time,
life hasn't been fair,

1109
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:51,307
but it wasn't your fault.

1110
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:54,111
Now it's natural to feel
sorry for yourself,

1111
01:00:54,183 --> 01:00:57,118
but that's not going
to get you anywhere.

1112
01:00:57,186 --> 01:01:01,145
Look, we respect everything
you've accomplished,

1113
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:06,218
but more so we respect
who you've become.

1114
01:01:06,295 --> 01:01:09,662
Now, I know it's been
hard all this time

1115
01:01:09,732 --> 01:01:13,065
with your dad not
being around,

1116
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:16,264
maybe I can help you
with that.

1117
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:18,273
Now what do you say we get
this tree in the house, huh?

1118
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,945
It's a beauty, isn't it?

1119
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:30,818
Hey, remember
this little guy?

1120
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:32,013
Oh, yeah.

1121
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,179
Hey, Alex, come on in,

1122
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:37,419
decorating
the tree is the best part.

1123
01:01:37,493 --> 01:01:39,051
Oh, look, this is Jen's
Christmas ornament

1124
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:40,459
she made in second grade.

1125
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:43,260
Look at that.

1126
01:01:43,332 --> 01:01:44,799
Everything okay, Alex?

1127
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:47,836
I, um, I got my report card.

1128
01:01:47,904 --> 01:01:50,202
I don't know if you guys
want to see it or not.

1129
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:51,137
Absolutely!

1130
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:52,697
Yeah, of course, we do!

1131
01:01:55,578 --> 01:01:57,512
Will you look at that...
straight "A"s.

1132
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:59,207
Alex, that's great!

1133
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:00,544
We're so proud of you.

1134
01:02:00,616 --> 01:02:04,484
Nice work, this calls
for a celebration.

1135
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,385
Do you have an extra card
I could have for my mother,

1136
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:07,388
Mrs. Bante?

1137
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:09,186
Yeah, of course, Alex.

1138
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:11,417
Here you go.

1139
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:12,483
Thanks.

1140
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:13,494
Would you help me
with the tree?

1141
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,190
Yeah.

1142
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:20,027
You know, Alex, if you wanted to
get a present for your mother

1143
01:02:20,103 --> 01:02:22,401
I could take you shopping,
pick out something nice.

1144
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:25,168
No thanks, Mrs. Bante.

1145
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:27,766
Well, if you wanted to visit
her, I could take you there.

1146
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:30,039
I don't think so.

1147
01:02:30,113 --> 01:02:32,911
Alex, it must be hard spending
Christmas without her.

1148
01:02:32,982 --> 01:02:36,247
No, I've spent a lot of
Christmas's without her.

1149
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,088
College girl's home!

1150
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:45,150
- Hey!
- Mom!

1151
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:47,594
Oh, welcome home, sweetheart!

1152
01:02:47,663 --> 01:02:49,130
Did Dad tell you how much
we missed you?

1153
01:02:49,198 --> 01:02:51,393
Only for the last 300 miles.

1154
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:53,094
Good, good, well, let's
get you settled.

1155
01:02:53,169 --> 01:02:56,263
There's tons of food
in the kitchen.

1156
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:07,079
It is so good to be home with
my folks and my little bro.

1157
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:10,586
College is great
but the food sucks.

1158
01:03:10,653 --> 01:03:13,281
I'm so excited for mom's
Christmas Eve dinner tonight.

1159
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:17,417
The turkey smells so good!

1160
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:19,154
Believe me, you're going
to want seconds.

1161
01:03:21,264 --> 01:03:23,630
Jen...

1162
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:27,157
how come you don't mind
sharing your parents with me?

1163
01:03:27,236 --> 01:03:31,639
It doesn't take anything away
from how they feel about me.

1164
01:03:31,707 --> 01:03:33,402
They have plenty of love
to go around.

1165
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:34,636
It's just who they are.

1166
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:35,870
But they hardly know me.

1167
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:38,505
I mean, how could
they love me?

1168
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:40,981
Because they do.

1169
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:43,917
You're worth being loved,
Alex.

1170
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:45,817
You know that, right?

1171
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:51,988
Are you going to go see
your mom on Christmas?

1172
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:54,325
No.

1173
01:03:54,397 --> 01:03:56,365
Or at least call her?

1174
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:00,332
Do you ever talk to her?

1175
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:04,134
I, um, I write to her.

1176
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:05,834
Well, that's good.

1177
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:19,318
What's this?

1178
01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:21,481
I don't send the letters.

1179
01:04:21,557 --> 01:04:22,854
Why not?

1180
01:04:22,925 --> 01:04:25,155
You don't know how angry
she was, Jen.

1181
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:28,595
Especially when I went to court
to terminate her rights.

1182
01:04:28,664 --> 01:04:31,360
I abandoned her,
just like she did to me

1183
01:04:31,434 --> 01:04:33,197
only she couldn't help it.

1184
01:04:33,269 --> 01:04:35,328
Neither could you.

1185
01:04:35,404 --> 01:04:36,962
Well, I don't think
she'll ever forgive me.

1186
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:39,974
Of course she will,
she's your mom.

1187
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:44,945
She loves you
no matter what.

1188
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:46,982
Come on, let's go.

1189
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:48,243
Where to?

1190
01:04:48,317 --> 01:04:50,808
Let's go give your mom
the best Christmas present

1191
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,184
that she has ever had.

1192
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:53,347
Jen, I can't.

1193
01:04:53,422 --> 01:04:54,616
Come on!

1194
01:04:57,026 --> 01:04:58,789
- Come on!
- Jen!

1195
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:19,678
Nistor, apartment 103.

1196
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:31,618
Wait, wait, wait, Jen!

1197
01:05:31,694 --> 01:05:33,059
What if she freaks out?

1198
01:05:33,129 --> 01:05:35,324
Come on, Alex, we're here now,
you can do this.

1199
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:37,366
No, no, no, I can't, Jen,
please, I can't,

1200
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:38,764
I'm not ready to see her,
please!

1201
01:05:38,834 --> 01:05:41,564
Jen, please!

1202
01:05:41,637 --> 01:05:44,401
I'm sorry, Alex,
I didn't realize.

1203
01:05:44,473 --> 01:05:45,565
Do you want to leave
the letters?

1204
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:50,101
No, this was a mistake
coming here.

1205
01:05:50,179 --> 01:05:51,646
All right, let's go.

1206
01:06:14,236 --> 01:06:16,295
- Merry Christmas, everyone!
- Presents

1207
01:06:16,372 --> 01:06:18,033
Come here quick!

1208
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:19,540
All right, which one's mine,
which one's mine?

1209
01:06:19,608 --> 01:06:22,702
Well, well, it looks like Santa
was generous this year, huh?

1210
01:06:22,778 --> 01:06:26,305
Okay, I want you both
to open these first.

1211
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:27,781
That's for you and...

1212
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:29,283
Slow down.

1213
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:30,341
What is it, what is it?

1214
01:06:30,419 --> 01:06:31,613
That's for you.

1215
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,086
- Mom.
- Do you like it?

1216
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:40,355
This is awesome!

1217
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:42,056
I cannot believe that you
saved all my old t-shirts!

1218
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:43,359
I did, I did.

1219
01:06:43,432 --> 01:06:45,161
There's one from your tennis
team, your debate club

1220
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:46,599
when you ran for
student counsel

1221
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:48,261
and a whole bunch of music
groups I've never heard of.

1222
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:49,599
Me neither.

1223
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:50,900
I cannot wait to put this on
my bed in my dorm room!

1224
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:53,373
Oh, I'm glad you like it,
Merry Christmas, sweetheart!

1225
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:54,841
Thank you.

1226
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:55,899
Well, how about me?

1227
01:06:55,978 --> 01:06:58,242
- I made it.
- Yeah, right, thank you.

1228
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:02,943
I hope you like it, think
of it as a family heirloom.

1229
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:07,581
Something you can keep
forever if you want.

1230
01:07:07,656 --> 01:07:10,591
It's amazing.

1231
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:12,752
The letters spell out
Harvard.

1232
01:07:12,828 --> 01:07:14,887
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1233
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:21,095
Jen, just give him
a minute.

1234
01:07:22,471 --> 01:07:25,269
This is a good thing,
he should be happy.

1235
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:26,968
I think he is.

1236
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:29,273
He probably never had much of
a real Christmas growing up.

1237
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:33,372
I'm sure it's just a little bit
overwhelming for him.

1238
01:07:33,449 --> 01:07:34,575
Yeah.

1239
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:39,920
Dear Mom,

1240
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:43,015
I heard you're out
of the hospital.

1241
01:07:43,092 --> 01:07:45,890
I hope you're
feeling better.

1242
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:48,862
Even though I haven't
seen you in a long time

1243
01:07:48,931 --> 01:07:53,732
I want you to know I think
about you a lot and I miss you.

1244
01:07:53,803 --> 01:07:56,772
Here's my number in case
you want to call sometime.

1245
01:07:56,839 --> 01:07:58,932
I hope you have a great
holiday, Mom.

1246
01:07:59,008 --> 01:08:00,236
Love Alex.

1247
01:08:08,117 --> 01:08:10,381
- Hello?
- Alex?

1248
01:08:10,453 --> 01:08:13,251
Mom?

1249
01:08:13,322 --> 01:08:15,153
How are you?

1250
01:08:15,224 --> 01:08:19,752
I'm all right, much better
being in my own place.

1251
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:21,990
Is it nice?

1252
01:08:22,064 --> 01:08:25,056
Yes, yes, it is very nice.

1253
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:31,270
Maybe you can come
visit me sometime?

1254
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:33,001
Sure.

1255
01:08:33,075 --> 01:08:35,737
And, um, is it all right
where you are?

1256
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:36,937
Yeah.

1257
01:08:37,012 --> 01:08:38,070
Yeah?

1258
01:08:38,147 --> 01:08:39,239
Are they good to you?

1259
01:08:39,315 --> 01:08:40,748
Very good.

1260
01:08:46,088 --> 01:08:49,353
Thank you for the card,
it's beautiful,

1261
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:52,656
and it means so much
to me.

1262
01:08:52,728 --> 01:08:55,196
I wish you were here, Mom,
I miss you.

1263
01:08:55,264 --> 01:08:56,595
I miss you.

1264
01:08:58,267 --> 01:08:59,894
Merry Christmas.

1265
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:03,967
Merry Christmas.

1266
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:18,646
Well, it all looks great.

1267
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:20,518
Alex, we have a family
tradition.

1268
01:09:20,589 --> 01:09:23,615
Before we enjoy dinner,
we all like to share

1269
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:25,626
what we're thankful for.

1270
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:28,185
If you feel like it,
I hope you join in.

1271
01:09:28,264 --> 01:09:30,926
I'll go first.

1272
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,766
I'm thankful for sharing
this special time of year

1273
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:38,273
with the three of you.

1274
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:39,705
I'll go next.

1275
01:09:39,775 --> 01:09:42,539
I am thankful
for my beautiful family,

1276
01:09:42,611 --> 01:09:44,875
especially its newest
member, Alex.

1277
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:51,219
I'm grateful for my parents

1278
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:55,121
who help me through
all the difficult times.

1279
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,488
And my new iPad.

1280
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:05,960
Umm, I'm thankful for...

1281
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:07,366
having a normal Christmas.

1282
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:15,704
Well, okay, I like that.

1283
01:10:15,778 --> 01:10:17,575
Let's raise
our glasses.

1284
01:10:17,646 --> 01:10:18,806
To a normal Christmas.

1285
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:22,009
- To a normal Christmas.
- Normal Christmas.

1286
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:26,120
Okay, let's eat.

1287
01:10:26,188 --> 01:10:27,280
I'm starved.

1288
01:10:27,356 --> 01:10:28,914
All right,
sweet potatoes, Mom?

1289
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:30,185
Yeah.

1290
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:32,318
Alex, pass the buns
around, please.

1291
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:35,354
But, Mr. Bante, you didn't
need to buy me a suit.

1292
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:37,023
Alex, you're not going to wear
a t-shirt and jeans

1293
01:10:37,099 --> 01:10:38,828
to your high school graduation.

1294
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:40,334
And what about your
college interviews?

1295
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:41,369
It's too expensive.

1296
01:10:41,437 --> 01:10:43,997
Hey, you let me worry
about that.

1297
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:48,066
Hey!

1298
01:10:48,143 --> 01:10:49,337
You wanna go to prom
with us?

1299
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:50,378
Are you kidding?

1300
01:10:50,446 --> 01:10:51,913
No, people go in
groups all the time...

1301
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:53,175
Well, not everybody but...

1302
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:54,682
Yeah, come on, dude,
it'll be a blast.

1303
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:56,650
- What's the theme again?
- "It's a jungle out there."

1304
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:59,552
Yeah, me Tarzan,
she Jane, you Cheetah.

1305
01:10:59,622 --> 01:11:00,486
Very funny.

1306
01:11:00,556 --> 01:11:02,353
No, seriously, will you go?

1307
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:04,119
- Sure.
- All right.

1308
01:11:11,533 --> 01:11:14,502
Well, how are you feeling
about your Harvard interview?

1309
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:16,561
It's coming up,
isn't it?

1310
01:11:16,639 --> 01:11:21,872
31 hours and 14 minutes.

1311
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:24,139
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

1312
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:26,511
Just remember,
be yourself,

1313
01:11:26,582 --> 01:11:29,608
look 'em in the eye, give
them a firm handshake, okay?

1314
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:30,845
Okay.

1315
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:35,982
Excuse me, I gotta
take this.

1316
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:40,256
There you go.

1317
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:41,193
Mom, calm down.

1318
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:45,395
I can't
understand you, okay?

1319
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:46,832
Okay, don't worry about it;

1320
01:11:46,902 --> 01:11:49,029
I'll take care of it.

1321
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:07,118
Thanks for coming.

1322
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:08,247
I didn't know who else
to call.

1323
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:10,292
Not a problem,
what happened?

1324
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:11,792
I don't know exactly.

1325
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:13,384
I thought she was doing okay.

1326
01:12:13,462 --> 01:12:16,659
Now she's been evicted and
she's back in the hospital.

1327
01:12:16,732 --> 01:12:18,097
Okay.

1328
01:12:39,655 --> 01:12:43,091
This is why I'm always afraid
to let her back into my life.

1329
01:12:43,158 --> 01:12:44,955
Do the Bantes know
about this?

1330
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:46,688
I didn't want
to tell them.

1331
01:12:46,762 --> 01:12:50,323
Well, I'm pretty sure
they'd want to help.

1332
01:13:10,018 --> 01:13:12,816
You okay, Alex?

1333
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:15,049
I should have been
there for her.

1334
01:13:15,124 --> 01:13:16,523
I should have taken
care of her.

1335
01:13:16,592 --> 01:13:17,991
You're just a kid.

1336
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,857
You couldn't take care
of her.

1337
01:13:19,928 --> 01:13:21,623
You need help.

1338
01:13:21,697 --> 01:13:22,823
You need to tell the Bantes.

1339
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:24,365
Get them involved.

1340
01:13:24,433 --> 01:13:25,957
No, this is none
of their concern.

1341
01:13:26,034 --> 01:13:28,298
Yes, it is because
you're their concern.

1342
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:30,361
That's the problem, Henry.

1343
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:32,907
They want to
help too much.

1344
01:13:32,975 --> 01:13:35,307
Because they care about you.

1345
01:13:35,377 --> 01:13:38,676
That's just the way moms
and dads are, man.

1346
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:41,045
I already have a mother.

1347
01:13:41,116 --> 01:13:46,315
Oh, Alex, it's not
the Bantes fault

1348
01:13:46,388 --> 01:13:48,720
that your mom couldn't
take care of you.

1349
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:51,055
You gotta stop blaming them.

1350
01:13:51,126 --> 01:13:54,357
Everybody needs somebody.

1351
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:57,524
Stop trying to act like
you're different.

1352
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:02,804
Alex, where have you been?

1353
01:14:02,871 --> 01:14:04,498
We've been worried
sick about you!

1354
01:14:04,573 --> 01:14:06,063
Are you all right?

1355
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:07,403
It's my mom.

1356
01:14:10,979 --> 01:14:12,503
I need your help.

1357
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:18,478
It's going to be okay.

1358
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:22,984
She's in room 304.

1359
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:24,548
We can go up anytime.

1360
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:26,321
Do you want us to go in
with you?

1361
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:29,762
Well, if you don't mind,
I'd like to go in alone.

1362
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:31,629
Of course,
we'll wait here.

1363
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,395
Just take
as long as you want, okay?

1364
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:42,167
Dr. Reynoldson, you have
a call at Nurse's station 2.

1365
01:14:42,244 --> 01:14:45,611
Dr. Reynoldson, phone call
at Nurse's station 2.

1366
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:17,808
Mom?

1367
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:33,755
I'm sorry I never came
to see you.

1368
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:07,222
I wrote to you.

1369
01:16:07,296 --> 01:16:08,593
I don't know why
I didn't send them

1370
01:16:08,664 --> 01:16:10,256
but I want you to have
them now.

1371
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:30,347
I'm sorry about
everything, Mom.

1372
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:42,557
Alex.

1373
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:50,101
Should we go talk to him?

1374
01:16:50,172 --> 01:16:51,104
Not right now.

1375
01:16:51,173 --> 01:16:52,140
He needs a little time
to deal

1376
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:53,174
with whatever
happened back there.

1377
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:55,209
His Harvard interview
is tomorrow.

1378
01:16:57,913 --> 01:16:59,005
Come on.

1379
01:17:03,418 --> 01:17:04,612
Come in.

1380
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:10,856
I brought you some
hot chocolate,

1381
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:12,325
put little marshmallows
in it.

1382
01:17:12,394 --> 01:17:14,157
Jen likes it that way.

1383
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:16,390
I thought maybe
you would too.

1384
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:18,524
Thanks.

1385
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:19,794
Here you go.

1386
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:23,331
Anything else you
need, Alex?

1387
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:24,633
Anything at all?

1388
01:17:24,706 --> 01:17:27,402
No.

1389
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:28,966
Okay.

1390
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:34,911
I'm sorry, Mrs. Bante.

1391
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:36,848
Sorry for what?

1392
01:17:36,918 --> 01:17:38,476
You tried to do all
this nice stuff for me

1393
01:17:38,553 --> 01:17:41,750
and I couldn't handle it.

1394
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:42,983
I wasn't used to it.

1395
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:47,962
I know.

1396
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:50,624
You thought I was trying
to take your mother's place.

1397
01:17:50,699 --> 01:17:54,396
You do all the things
that I needed her to do.

1398
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:56,164
I felt guilty about thinking
you were better at it

1399
01:17:56,238 --> 01:17:57,671
than she was.

1400
01:17:57,739 --> 01:18:00,867
Alex, your mother couldn't
give you what you needed

1401
01:18:00,942 --> 01:18:03,604
but I know she tried
as hard as she could.

1402
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:08,346
How can you be so sure?

1403
01:18:08,417 --> 01:18:11,875
Because I know how much
a mother loves a child,

1404
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:14,387
how much we want
to protect them.

1405
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:15,718
And if we're unable
to do that

1406
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:19,625
it's because it's out
of our control.

1407
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:23,358
It's the worst feeling
in the world.

1408
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:26,128
I know your mother loves
you, Alex, I know it.

1409
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:29,832
And so do I.

1410
01:18:40,482 --> 01:18:42,382
Rise and shine, buddy,
today's the big day.

1411
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:44,442
Suzanne pressed your suit,
picked out a tie,

1412
01:18:44,519 --> 01:18:46,510
and we're having
French toast for breakfast.

1413
01:19:13,915 --> 01:19:16,281
Alex, why aren't you dressed?

1414
01:19:16,351 --> 01:19:17,545
Yeah, your interview
is at 11:00.

1415
01:19:17,619 --> 01:19:19,450
It's all the way
across town.

1416
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:21,455
I'm not going.

1417
01:19:21,523 --> 01:19:23,616
What?

1418
01:19:23,692 --> 01:19:25,990
I mean, what's the point?

1419
01:19:26,061 --> 01:19:29,929
I've just been
kidding myself.

1420
01:19:29,998 --> 01:19:32,398
Why would Harvard
take a kid like me?

1421
01:19:32,467 --> 01:19:34,162
I've been in and out of
seven foster homes

1422
01:19:34,236 --> 01:19:35,362
and nothing ever works out

1423
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:38,201
so why would
this be any different?

1424
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:39,865
I'll tell you why,
Alex,

1425
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:42,000
because you have a gift.

1426
01:19:42,077 --> 01:19:44,341
One that you inherited
from your mom,

1427
01:19:44,412 --> 01:19:46,107
and her of all people
would hate to see you

1428
01:19:46,181 --> 01:19:48,411
throw that gift away.

1429
01:19:48,483 --> 01:19:51,646
Did something happen
at the hospital?

1430
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:55,247
If you talk about it
maybe we can help.

1431
01:19:55,323 --> 01:19:56,756
Please.

1432
01:20:00,162 --> 01:20:01,595
When I was 10 and I saw
her in the hospital

1433
01:20:01,663 --> 01:20:02,857
for the first time,

1434
01:20:02,931 --> 01:20:05,764
you know what really got
to me?

1435
01:20:05,834 --> 01:20:08,064
It was her hands.

1436
01:20:08,136 --> 01:20:10,297
At the time, I called
them her alligator hands

1437
01:20:10,372 --> 01:20:12,738
because she had them
curled up tight

1438
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:16,972
against her chest
like this.

1439
01:20:17,045 --> 01:20:19,639
I saw those same hands again
last night.

1440
01:20:21,516 --> 01:20:25,577
After all these years,
nothing's changed.

1441
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:26,678
She's never going
to get better

1442
01:20:26,755 --> 01:20:28,484
and it's always going
to be the same.

1443
01:20:28,557 --> 01:20:32,584
You can't give into that.

1444
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:34,492
But what if I end up
like my mother?

1445
01:20:34,563 --> 01:20:37,361
Alex, that is not going
to happen.

1446
01:20:37,432 --> 01:20:39,263
I just wanted her to tell me
I could do it.

1447
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:42,030
She knows you can do it.

1448
01:20:42,103 --> 01:20:45,004
And so do we.

1449
01:20:45,073 --> 01:20:47,007
You know what, Alex,

1450
01:20:47,075 --> 01:20:52,012
we haven't asked a lot of you
but we're asking now.

1451
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,571
Go upstairs,
put that suit on

1452
01:20:54,649 --> 01:20:56,913
and let's get you
to that interview.

1453
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:11,931
A firm handshake, right?

1454
01:21:14,035 --> 01:21:15,297
That's right.

1455
01:21:32,988 --> 01:21:34,580
Alex Chivescu?

1456
01:21:34,656 --> 01:21:37,090
How do you do?

1457
01:21:37,158 --> 01:21:40,059
Please come on up,
we've got lots to talk about.

1458
01:22:27,275 --> 01:22:28,674
Well, how'd it go?

1459
01:22:28,743 --> 01:22:30,472
I gave it my best shot.

1460
01:22:30,545 --> 01:22:31,773
That's my boy.

1461
01:22:31,846 --> 01:22:32,870
Come on.

1462
01:22:43,491 --> 01:22:45,652
Jim, it's here!

1463
01:22:47,862 --> 01:22:48,794
It's here?

1464
01:22:48,863 --> 01:22:51,798
- Yeah.
- All right.

1465
01:22:51,866 --> 01:22:53,925
Now, before I open this,

1466
01:22:54,002 --> 01:22:55,765
there's a couple things
I want to say.

1467
01:22:55,837 --> 01:22:57,134
Okay.

1468
01:22:57,205 --> 01:23:01,369
First, I respect you both,
Mr. And Mrs. Bante,

1469
01:23:01,443 --> 01:23:04,537
more than anyone else
I've ever known.

1470
01:23:04,612 --> 01:23:10,209
Second, I used to think
that this was everything.

1471
01:23:10,285 --> 01:23:13,083
Now, I still hope I get in

1472
01:23:13,154 --> 01:23:14,712
but if I don't,
I'll go somewhere else

1473
01:23:14,789 --> 01:23:19,692
because the thing is I already
have what matters most...

1474
01:23:22,163 --> 01:23:23,790
...a family.

1475
01:23:30,638 --> 01:23:32,868
Alex, open it.

1476
01:23:55,263 --> 01:23:56,355
I made it.

1477
01:23:56,431 --> 01:23:58,763
What?

1478
01:23:58,833 --> 01:23:59,857
I made it!

1479
01:24:00,902 --> 01:24:02,995
- Yeah!
- He's going to Harvard!

1480
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:05,596
I gotta call Jen and Lucy
and Danny!

1481
01:24:05,673 --> 01:24:07,231
Go, go, go!

1482
01:24:07,308 --> 01:24:08,673
He did it, Jim!

1483
01:24:08,743 --> 01:24:09,710
No, we did it.

1484
01:24:11,279 --> 01:24:12,337
That's good,
right, I got this.

1485
01:24:12,414 --> 01:24:14,211
Okay, squeeze in, you guys,
squeeze in.

1486
01:24:14,282 --> 01:24:16,842
All right, Eagle Creek grads,
say, "2009."

1487
01:24:16,918 --> 01:24:19,250
- 2009!
- Whoo!

1488
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:20,582
That's good, that's good,
one more,

1489
01:24:20,655 --> 01:24:22,282
one more, 2009.

1490
01:24:22,357 --> 01:24:24,120
2009!

1491
01:24:33,935 --> 01:24:35,027
Oh, man!

1492
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:40,203
I don't believe it,

1493
01:24:40,275 --> 01:24:41,936
I'll be right back.

1494
01:24:44,546 --> 01:24:46,309
I can't believe you
guys came!

1495
01:24:46,381 --> 01:24:48,246
My man, of course
we came!

1496
01:24:48,316 --> 01:24:50,876
We couldn't miss
this party!

1497
01:24:50,952 --> 01:24:53,785
Listen, you need any help
with that college algebra,

1498
01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:54,753
you know who to call.

1499
01:24:54,823 --> 01:24:56,222
Yeah, how've you been,
Carlos?

1500
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:57,417
I'm good.

1501
01:24:57,492 --> 01:24:59,016
I'm working, I'm going
to community college.

1502
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:00,083
Yeah?

1503
01:25:00,161 --> 01:25:01,321
Taking classes in welding.

1504
01:25:01,396 --> 01:25:03,296
You ought to see this guy
with a blowtorch.

1505
01:25:03,364 --> 01:25:04,262
I'm awesome.

1506
01:25:04,332 --> 01:25:06,732
Yeah, I bet you are.

1507
01:25:09,304 --> 01:25:11,465
Um, excuse me.

1508
01:25:21,749 --> 01:25:24,718
I am so proud of you.

1509
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:26,720
Thank you.

1510
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:28,949
Thanks for coming, Mom.

1511
01:25:29,023 --> 01:25:30,718
I wouldn't miss
this for the world.

1512
01:25:34,262 --> 01:25:36,162
I read your letters.

1513
01:25:36,231 --> 01:25:39,997
It really means a lot to me
that you wrote them.

1514
01:25:40,068 --> 01:25:41,899
I'm sorry I never
mailed them.

1515
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:44,632
No, Alex, I'm sorry.

1516
01:25:44,706 --> 01:25:46,367
I'm so...

1517
01:25:46,441 --> 01:25:47,669
I'm so very sorry
you had to go through

1518
01:25:47,742 --> 01:25:50,575
everything you went through.

1519
01:25:50,645 --> 01:25:53,637
It wasn't
your fault, Mom.

1520
01:25:53,715 --> 01:25:56,946
Thanks for that.

1521
01:25:57,018 --> 01:26:00,351
Okay, anyway...

1522
01:26:00,421 --> 01:26:03,015
I got you something.

1523
01:26:03,091 --> 01:26:06,549
This is on loan until you get
one of your own from Harvard,

1524
01:26:06,628 --> 01:26:08,858
and I know you will.

1525
01:26:11,266 --> 01:26:14,895
I... I just
want you to know

1526
01:26:14,969 --> 01:26:19,269
that whatever I become,

1527
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:21,672
whatever I achieve
is because of you.

1528
01:26:24,712 --> 01:26:26,646
I love you, Mom.

1529
01:26:26,714 --> 01:26:27,908
I love you, too.

1530
01:26:30,151 --> 01:26:31,379
Congratulations.
