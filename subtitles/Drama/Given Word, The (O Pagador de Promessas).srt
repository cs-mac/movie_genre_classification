1
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,035
This does not look good.
Cap Rooney, three-time league MVP...

2
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,631
...and Coach Tony D'Amato's star
38-year-old quarterback is down.

3
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,909
Don't you see he's hurt?

4
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,511
-Did you see that?
-That hurts.

5
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,553
Every Shark fan has a sickening
feeling in his stomach.

6
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,193
Let's look at this again.

7
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,598
Cap Rooney is down and in pain.

8
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,835
Get me Vincent.

9
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,952
Riggman makes a beautiful move
over Julian Washington.

10
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,636
Which frees up Watson up the middle.
Look at Gates on the back side.

11
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,074
Who's on weak side safety?

12
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,112
Stop showing that.

13
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,433
We'll return with Cap's condition
after a word from our sponsors.

14
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,153
-They cut to a commercial.
-I think I broke my back!

15
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,270
My butt!

16
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,199
Damn it! Fuck!

17
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,278
-Where's it hurt?
-Where you're touching it!

18
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,432
Candy-ass, no-blocking bitches!

19
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,993
Suck it up, Cap.

20
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,949
Can't breathe.

21
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,639
Neither can I.
It's the humidity.

22
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,349
Should we get a stretcher?

23
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,516
Do I have to get a stretcher?
You that old?

24
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,638
Wait! Wait!

25
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,995
I should, but you just
bled on my suit.

26
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,675
There goes history.
That's the real deal there.

27
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,278
Thirty-nine-year-old Cap Rooney...

28
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,274
...two-time Pantheon Cup winner,
almost 50,000 passing yards...

29
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,432
...now to be replaced
by the second-string quarterback.

30
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,030
All right, nice and easy.
We're up. See? 21 -17.

31
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,437
Just hold on. Steady.

32
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,595
Where's my helmet?

33
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,035
Get him his helmet.
You'll need that, Tyler.

34
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,876
I'm not really sure how D'Amato's
going to get over this one, Kev.

35
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,036
Way to hold that football, kid.

36
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,996
Take it easy. Don't worry.

37
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,879
We're gonna finish this one
without you.

38
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,640
With three losses and three games
until the playoffs...

39
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,991
...this could spell the end
to an already dismal season.

40
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,237
Attendance is down,
while the Dolphins have prospered.

41
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,160
Bad-coaching-dot-com.
That's Tony's web site.

42
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,392
Horny, your zone coverage is soft.
Press it.

43
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,918
Get that out of my face. Shark! We
need more pressure on the quarterback.

44
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,599
-I'm on it, coach.
-Go fix it.

45
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,791
-I said fix it!
-I'm on it, goddamn it!

46
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,477
This'll put the Sharks' playoff hopes
on the shoulders of Julian Washington.

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,436
Backup quarterback Tyler Cherubini
has not seen a lot of action.

48
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,110
Cherubini has not thrown
for a first down all season.

49
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,715
Fumble!

50
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,228
Oh, my gosh! Touchdown!

51
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,710
The Americans go up, 23 to 21.

52
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,549
Man, oh, man!
Did they nail him!

53
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,479
It doesn't look like
Cherubini's getting up.

54
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,556
Fuck!

55
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,355
Two quarterbacks in a row.
I have not seen this since '88.

56
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,909
Or '78? When the Aztecs
and the Pharaohs lived.

57
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,429
Any given Sunday,
anything can happen.

58
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,359
They need you back.
Cherubini's down.

59
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,677
Did he fall off the bench?
What the hell's next? Stigmata?

60
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,997
Sit him out and don't touch him
till I get back.

61
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,713
Give me the names of players
in the quarterback market.

62
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,472
How about every available line coach?

63
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,188
Somebody who can teach this line
how to fucking block.

64
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,558
Malloy. Find out about him.

65
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,275
Cap's out.
Man, I can't believe it.

66
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,352
Do you know Willie Beamen?

67
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,949
No, I don't.
Who is Willie Beamen?

68
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,599
Beamen! What are you doing?

69
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,479
-I told you to warm up 5 minutes ago!
-What happened?

70
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,553
Look at your fucking play card!
It's upside down!

71
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,398
Get your head out of your ass!

72
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,472
Beamen, you're up.
Left Deuce Zig 22 Tomcat.

73
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,157
You know what that is?
Easy handoff to Julian.

74
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,198
The Americans got no profile on you.
You surprise them.

75
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,634
Look at me!

76
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,674
You're gonna do fine.
You hold it all inside. There.

77
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,949
Stay focused.

78
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,513
Okay? Stay there.

79
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,875
Willie, can you hear me?

80
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,551
As we await word
on Cap's condition...

81
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,712
...Miami is sending in third-string
quarterback Willie Beamen.

82
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,114
I've been in too many of these.

83
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,478
Twenty-six years old, a mystery man.
7th-round pick out of Dallas.

84
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,478
In his fifth year. He went
to the University of Houston.

85
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,035
First year with the Sharks.

86
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,636
All right, listen up. We're gonna
run Left Deuce Zig 22 Tomcat.

87
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,913
What's the snap count?

88
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,078
Beamen, make the call!

89
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,429
You all right?

90
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,475
That's a first.

91
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,872
Fuck! You puked on the logo!

92
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,038
I got to get in a 3-point stance
in your vomit, nigger?

93
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,515
Set on two. On two. Ready?

94
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,753
Look at me.
I'll be the next to knock you up.

95
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,157
Buckle up! It's gonna be
a long day today.

96
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,034
Set!

97
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,555
66! Hike! Hike!

98
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,792
Get used to that! I'll be picking
peanuts out of your ass!

99
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,271
-First down!
-378! Hut! Hike!

100
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,114
Change the play. Audible.
Change the play!

101
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,112
Check it! Check it!
Red 70 Blackstar!

102
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,159
Red 70 Blackstar!

103
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,759
Where'd you dream that up, rook?

104
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,871
-Red what?
-What the fuck is that?

105
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,428
Looks like an audible.
Looks like a broken play.

106
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,270
Goddamn it!

107
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,792
Does he know any of these plays?

108
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,913
The guy knows the basic package,
but he's only taken a few snaps.

109
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,752
What's a Red 70 Blackstar?
There is no such fucking play!

110
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,792
I just figured that out, J.

111
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,393
But there should be one.

112
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,353
It's the future of the team.

113
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,913
Blue 88! Blue 88!

114
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,633
Unless you gonna kiss me,
get your hand off my ass!

115
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,110
That's what your girl told me
last night!

116
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,713
Hurry! Hurry up!

117
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,719
He's letting it go!

118
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,234
Interception!

119
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,550
Intercepted by Gates!

120
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,753
This kid's been moving too fast.

121
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,520
He's way ahead of his receiver.
He's nervous.

122
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,879
And it's Minnesota 24
and Miami 21 at the half.

123
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,799
Try an enema.
What do I give a shit?

124
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,958
When this corner's coming up
I want you to drop back.

125
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,351
We got a third-string quarterback
that won't produce shit.

126
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,912
When I'm talking about defense,
you're dumb enough, we made it simple.

127
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,554
We made this shit real fucking simple.

128
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,915
101 . You lightheaded?

129
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,954
I was lightheaded at kickoff. Now I'm
one-foot-in-the-fucking-coffin stage.

130
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,589
A couple quarts low.
You need an oil change, Madman.

131
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,035
Then why are my legs
one big fucking knot?

132
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,834
I need some Vicodin.
I need some cyclobenzaprine...!

133
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,873
Put that on your nose.
Harvey, could I speak to you?

134
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,030
Cap's losing ankle strength.

135
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,749
You examined him?

136
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,952
Ollie, you're one of the few
relatives I can stomach...

137
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,879
...but you're the internist.
I'm the orthopedist, remember?

138
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,918
Bone, muscle, joint, me.
Runny nose, diarrhea, pinkeye, you.

139
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,997
Got it? Thanks.

140
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,240
Bad news, Cap. You're okay.
It's just a bruise.

141
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,278
No ribs broken.
Your back film's normal.

142
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,830
Something is definitely wrong here.
My butt is killing me!

143
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,632
I'll send you over for an MRI.

144
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,113
Doc, pull the pipes, man!

145
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,475
Doc, I got to go, man!
Call of the wild!

146
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,955
-Out of my way!
-Sharks football: Whatever it takes!

147
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,672
Place-kicker, out of the way!

148
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,519
I'm taking a dump, unless you want
to be in a shitstorm!

149
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,472
Don't bend your elbows.

150
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,512
Whatever. Do what you gotta do!

151
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,514
Sit down! Listen up!

152
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,678
Who are you throwing to? The receiver?
Or you got some other shit on your mind?

153
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,509
We just lost two goddamn quarterbacks...

154
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,517
...in one half of football...

155
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,193
...because our line...

156
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,393
...couldn't pick up a backside bandit
on max protection!

157
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,036
All week long we work on the calls.

158
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,356
Over, over, over again!

159
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,120
You are not fucking focused!!

160
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,873
McKenna, what are you doing?!

161
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,835
Keep your head on a swivel!
Slide out there! Pick up that robber!

162
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,792
Roll up those outside linebackers!

163
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,071
Know your site adjustments.
Understand?

164
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,748
Sanderson and Fox
will break off their routes...

165
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,112
...but you gotta be there and deliver.
Two turnovers in one half!

166
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,239
Defense!
This is what we gotta do here.

167
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,040
I don't know.
You gotta do something out there.

168
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,995
You gotta make it happen.

169
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,789
You gotta stop flying around the ball!
Tackle somebody!

170
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,474
Don't let these guys
chew up the clock on us.

171
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,991
When we put eight in a box,
you gotta jam those receivers!

172
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,392
If you make mistakes, make them big.
I won't eat your lunch for that.

173
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,672
Here we got P.J.,
Mac, Beastman, Horny, Shark.

174
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,552
One-two yards less each time...

175
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,957
...they'll be looking at second and 8,
instead of second and 6.

176
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,391
We're only down by 3.
We can win this.

177
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,755
We got three losses in a row!

178
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,077
I'm sick and tired of this.
Are you?

179
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,510
Because if you're not,
raise your hand. Come on.

180
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,154
If you're going to act like a loser,
raise your hand.

181
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,154
If you're going to act like pussy,
raise your hand!

182
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,748
What are you doing, J?

183
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,157
I didn't want you to be the only pussy
with his hand raised, coach.

184
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,155
Gentlemen!

185
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,110
This is where we live!

186
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,472
We're not gonna let them
fuck with us in our house, are we?

187
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,237
Let's go out there and kick some
second-half butt!

188
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,518
We got a dance planned for you.
Payback's a bitch!

189
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,869
Motherfucker!

190
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,548
I'll fucking kill you, son of a bitch!

191
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,277
Get this guy under control!

192
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,469
Settle him down!

193
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,272
Slot Left 90 Go Z Read.

194
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,190
Here we go.
Settle down, settle down.

195
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,995
Shit!

196
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,352
We got it back. We got it back.

197
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,232
Time-out, time-out.

198
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,632
It looks like back surgery...

199
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,876
...but I'm told he may be back
by playoffs.

200
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,275
What's wrong?

201
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,195
What's wrong?

202
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,273
It's just moving so fast.

203
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,478
Believe me when I tell you this.

204
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,477
You can only get better.

205
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,112
And you don't have to worry about
getting the hook...

206
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,078
...because I got no one left.

207
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,712
I'm playing like shit.
I ain't playing like myself.

208
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,469
You know how to play.
You played this game your whole life.

209
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,034
You know what I'm saying?

210
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,078
You grew up in Dallas, right?

211
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,914
So maybe you're back in Dallas
right now.

212
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,598
You're home, you're enjoying yourself.

213
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,475
You're back in the 'hood just before
your mama calls you in for dinner.

214
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,514
I say, "Go to the Buick.
Turn around, I'll throw it to you."

215
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,870
-Remember that?
-Something like that.

216
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,275
What I'm saying is,
you gotta forget it all.

217
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,795
The crowd, the audibles,
the goddamn playbook.

218
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,597
Just focus on this next one pass.

219
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,275
Go to the Buick. Turn around.

220
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,028
Turn around.

221
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,351
Enjoy it.
That's what you're here for.

222
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,512
Slot. Throw it.

223
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,912
Forget the whole goddamn playbook.

224
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,829
Just focus on this one next pass.

225
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,512
He's got it! He's got it!

226
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,990
Touchdown, Sanderson!

227
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,232
And what a feeling it must be
for young Willie Beamen.

228
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,919
It's his first AFFA touchdown.

229
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,315
The Sharks are back in the ball game.

230
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,959
Let's kick some extra point.
Let's get off the field.

231
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,557
Where did we find this guy, Johnny?

232
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,832
I think Arnie spotted him
before he left.

233
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,798
D'Amato's gotta go for it. If he gets
first down, he can run out the clock.

234
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,634
-What's with these plays?
-I can't get in his face.

235
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,910
Tell him he's gotta take a chance.

236
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,111
-I'm doing my best.
-Turn up the volume!

237
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,634
Red Beats Read.

238
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,750
They're giving us the flat.

239
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,951
-Let's run smoke and throw.
-They're looking for the pick.

240
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,595
I'm not taking any chances,
not with this ballerina.

241
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,118
Third down and five.

242
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,308
They're screaming for him to dump it.

243
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,748
It's wide open.

244
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,916
I know this coach. He's a prick.

245
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,588
This is a setup. I've seen this.
We'll run it again.

246
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,869
Let's do it!

247
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,991
Let's do Deuce Left 22...

248
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,516
Run the same play?!

249
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,392
All the Sharks have to do
is hold on to the ball.

250
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,871
It's money time! Give me five!
We home and dry and flying high.

251
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,958
Let the D win it, J-man.
We don't need no first down.

252
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,071
That's why you don't score
with the ladies!

253
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,679
Same play. Same play.

254
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,756
On two!

255
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,989
Call time-out. They're stacked up
against the run.

256
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,031
Time-out's for TV. Negative.

257
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,799
Fumble!

258
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,792
He fumbled!

259
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,798
Loose ball! Minnesota's got it.

260
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,672
How stupid! How selfish!

261
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,038
Julian Washington fumbles the ball!

262
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,434
In your face!

263
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,875
You wonder if the million-dollar
bonus when he reaches 1500 yards...

264
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,559
...didn't play into that one.

265
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,230
That's right, Kev. And now D'Amato's
lost four games in a row.

266
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,953
Two hands!

267
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,071
With two hands, you showboat!

268
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,153
Honey, please don't feel too bad.

269
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,393
We lost once.

270
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,238
All of a sudden...

271
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,670
...one of these real tall gentlemen...

272
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,632
...jumped up so high...

273
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,469
...and he just picked that thing
out of that air just like that.

274
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,477
And I thought your daddy...

275
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,996
I thought he'd have a heart attack.

276
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,156
He died because of this.

277
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,437
I don't want you to take anything
so seriously, honey.

278
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,279
-lt's just a game, honey.
-Good night, Mother.

279
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,751
-Good night, darling.
-At least the dog still loves her.

280
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,029
Make sure she gets home, all right?

281
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,389
No stops.

282
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,915
Shall I wait up?

283
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,511
No, I'd be a lousy date tonight.

284
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,393
Don't forget I'm in Boston tomorrow
for 2 or 3 days.

285
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,431
It's a complicated deposition.

286
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,039
I'm sorry. I forgot.

287
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,959
Kick their asses.

288
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,195
Tomorrow morning, first thing.

289
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,198
Make it three.

290
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,989
You want a walk-through?

291
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,992
Let it go, Willie.
You played strong.

292
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,513
I'm just sick of losing.

293
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,436
When you're my age,
you get used to it.

294
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,676
All right, everybody, listen up!

295
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,715
Played your hearts out there today.

296
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,396
No blame, nobody.

297
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,914
Let's take a knee. Father.

298
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,476
You and I have been in some tough
places together, haven't we?

299
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,438
I went to my playbook.

300
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,513
And the book says the rain falls
on the just and the unjust alike.

301
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,916
Now, we just lost four in a row.

302
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,671
That doesn't mean
that we're specially cursed.

303
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,793
Joy comes in the morning.

304
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,916
There are no atheists in foxholes.

305
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,834
Let's pray.

306
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,515
"Our Father, who art in Heaven..."

307
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,753
-How you doing, Rock?
-I felt like I was gonna die.

308
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,592
They went in and they sucked out...

309
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,633
...my L-5 disk.

310
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,508
It's no big deal.

311
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,714
-Did we win?
-They beat us by three.

312
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,035
What'd the kid throw?

313
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,708
Nine of 14 for 176.

314
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,434
TDs?

315
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,876
Two.

316
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,394
Holy moly!

317
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,913
I can beat this.

318
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,319
Cindy, will you please call that nurse?!

319
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,513
This doesn't work! I'm a football
player! They gotta pump up the volume!

320
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,514
Breathe.

321
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,068
Don't overachieve.

322
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,838
Even at 50%%%, nobody's better.

323
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,439
Playoffs...

324
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,159
...l'll be ready.

325
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,071
It's getting late. I'm gonna stop by
in the morning. You get some rest.

326
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,197
-Good night, Cindy.
-Good night.

327
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,673
Don't you give up on me.

328
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,950
You're like a son to me, Cap.

329
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,714
I'll fight for you till the day I die.

330
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,712
Willie Beamen, I don't believe you.

331
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:32,516
Your first big game on TV,
and you didn't let your own mama know!

332
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,313
Here it is right here.

333
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,711
Not that Willie didn't have some
nauseating moments of his own.

334
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,235
Poor guy!

335
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,230
Are you gonna start?
You could at least play first-string.

336
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,555
No, probably not.

337
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,399
Let's hope Willie Beamen
brings his Tums with him.

338
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,875
-You should be starting.
-Mom, I'm number three.

339
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,275
There ain't nothing
I can do about it.

340
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,078
You've been at this for 5 years!

341
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,078
Tell everybody I said I love them,
and I'll see them.

342
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,709
-I love you too, Willie.
-I love you.

343
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,872
Baby, she just wants the best for you.

344
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,279
Yeah, I know she does.

345
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,833
You did great!

346
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,354
You gotta wonder why D'Amato
would call that play...

347
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,279
... when J-man likes to pick his spot
when he runs.

348
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,829
Calling the same play twice?
What's that about?

349
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,998
There's a reason this team's
lost four games in a row.

350
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,593
Forget about the offensive line.

351
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,314
And forget about Cap Rooney.

352
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,273
Forget about the money-grubbing
Christina Pagniacci.

353
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,310
Hello, genius!

354
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,869
This guy started coaching
in the late '60s, for God's sake!

355
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,559
I'm glad he's not talking about me.

356
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,591
-Here you go, coach.
-Thank you.

357
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,873
This is a team with more than 200
variations on the pass!

358
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,311
Napoleon D'Amato's playbook's
got less than 75 plays, total!

359
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,149
200 variations on a pass!
What's wrong with this picture?

360
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,550
You're that coach, right?

361
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,996
I'm Mandy. Mandy Murphy.

362
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,315
You look better in real life.
You're always yelling at people on TV.

363
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,958
At least I look better
than that old fart up there, no?

364
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,028
I think.

365
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,789
You do.

366
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,193
-How old are you?
-I don't think age matters.

367
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,960
I think older guys have a certain thing.

368
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,232
I've wanted to meet you since I was 16.

369
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,392
You were on the sidelines.
You were winning this big game.

370
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,836
The Pantheon Cup, yeah.

371
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,680
That was it.
God, that's so wild!

372
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,791
So you promise to keep a secret?

373
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,315
I don't know. How do you mean?
On a date?

374
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,513
I got a place.

375
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,597
It's close by. It's quiet.

376
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,314
It's a thousand.

377
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,990
Five thousand for the night.
You won't regret it.

378
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,276
I'm flattered, thank you, but...

379
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,793
I got friends.
I could do your friends too.

380
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,396
-Some other time maybe.
-Fair enough.

381
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,311
Good luck.
I'll be rooting for you.

382
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,630
-Thank you.
-Coach.

383
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,192
I know you're not gonna
pass on that, D'Amato.

384
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,872
I must be drunk.

385
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,796
...Christina Pagniacci,
who's so smart...

386
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,470
...she sold three of last year's
starters in the off-season.

387
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,989
You think you can lose
your coaching instincts?

388
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,475
You never had them.
How you gonna lose them?

389
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:06,198
All I got are my instincts.
I lose those, I got nothing.

390
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,437
Please leave your name and message
and we'll get right back to you.

391
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,995
Have a nice day. Bye-bye.

392
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,393
So, Jeanette...

393
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,950
I was hoping you'd be awake.

394
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,910
What time is it out there, anyway?

395
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,993
Never mind.

396
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,473
Could you tell Tommy that I'll be
in L.A. in a couple of weeks?

397
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,079
We got a game.

398
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,954
I'd like to get together with him...

399
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,076
...but I don't have his new number.

400
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,474
I really miss the shit out of
little Timmy and Melinda.

401
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,909
And you.

402
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,113
Grandkids.

403
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,313
We got grandkids.

404
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,676
Why did we get divorced anyway?

405
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,434
Fuck!

406
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,557
If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.

407
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,269
Shit!

408
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,870
We're gonna make a difference
this week!

409
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,396
Just the tip of the ball. Catch it!

410
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,872
This ain't no bullshit West Virginia.
You in the big leagues!

411
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,793
What the fuck is that? What are you,
a pussy? That ain't no damn hit.

412
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,515
-14 years, I know how to hit.
-14 years, you're captain.

413
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,515
Show me!

414
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,432
Break that shit up!

415
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,033
Goddamn it, baby! You did it!

416
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,151
That's my boy, my brotherfucker!

417
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,836
That's the way to hit it, Shark.
That is the way to hit it.

418
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,598
Now, come on in here.

419
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,753
Let me get this straight.

420
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,839
The California governor says there's
nothing for the public to vote on?

421
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,476
She's got the finances to build
a new stadium in Los Angeles...

422
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,749
...using lottery money.

423
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,479
Jeez, Ed!

424
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,711
L.A.'s a dream.

425
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:37,550
Certainly good enough to leverage the
city of Miami into a new stadium.

426
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,631
What about the Rosenthal bid?

427
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,398
$250 million?

428
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,029
It's so low.

429
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,278
With a new stadium and a winning team...

430
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,631
...this club is worth $800 million.

431
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,399
It's me!

432
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,998
You're like your dad.
You're a dreamer.

433
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,155
Take the money!

434
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,917
You're still young, darling.
Start over. Start a family.

435
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,918
You don't love football anyway.

436
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,838
It's none of your business, Ed.

437
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,078
Let's keep this between the three of us.

438
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,711
-Morning, Tony.
-Morning, Christina.

439
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,389
Alka-Seltzer?

440
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,280
No, thank you.
I had about four for breakfast.

441
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,195
This is a hell of a loss, Tony.

442
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,557
I can see how my mom could drink herself
into a stupor watching football games.

443
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,509
But this kind of play makes me
want to jump out of a window.

444
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:42,110
Well, you can run this a billion times,
but on any given Sunday...

445
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,197
"You'll either win or you'll lose.

446
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,671
The point is, can you win or lose
like a man?" Dad said lots of things.

447
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,154
Actually, I said that.

448
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,431
But he could never stand losing.

449
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,189
And Julian couldn't resist
going for his bonus yards.

450
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,908
Blame me, not Julian.
That was my call.

451
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,758
I know it was, Tony.

452
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,598
It's four in a row.

453
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,119
This season is a disaster.

454
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,788
Without the playoffs,
there's no more TV money.

455
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,319
You see this?

456
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,715
They want your head.

457
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,639
Your father would laugh at them.
This is a good team.

458
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,159
We hit, we win.

459
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,152
We put pressure, we win.

460
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,473
We penetrate, we win. You do it as
tough as it is possible to do!

461
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,235
And you do that in all things.

462
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,237
You die hard.

463
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,075
That's what I'm talking about.
You die hard.

464
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,749
Dad used to say:

465
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,636
"No intensity, no victory."

466
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,149
Where the hell is your intensity,
Tony?

467
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,637
Four years ago,
we won the Pantheon Cup!

468
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,715
-I was there, remember?
-Now what are we?

469
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,913
We're a second-tier team, that's what.

470
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,914
Admit it! You're not being honest!

471
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,472
We're a solid football team.
We're just not inspired.

472
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,638
Too many free agents.
We got Julian. He's a merc.

473
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,909
End of the season, he's gone.

474
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,395
Next year, we rebuild our running game.

475
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,115
You talk about a running game, but
who cares as long as you're winning?

476
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,392
People want to see passes, touchdowns.

477
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,795
High scores. That's the game today.

478
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,792
I paid a lot of money
to get Nick Crozier here...

479
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,917
...specifically to modernize...

480
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,714
Football's played on a field,
not in the goddamn boxes.

481
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,753
You knew that when you had candy
stuck in your braces.

482
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,428
If we had gotten the linemen I wanted...

483
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,596
...our first two quarterbacks
would still be walking.

484
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,199
Think of the future.

485
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,036
Do you know what we could get for Cap?

486
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,438
Probably a second
and a third-draft choice.

487
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,555
We know that he's finished but...

488
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,235
I don't know that Cap is finished.

489
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,274
Do I have to remind you
that he helped build this franchise?

490
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,755
He's a hero to the working people
of Florida!

491
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,398
Probably one of the greatest pressure
players of all time.

492
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,715
You can't cut Cap...

493
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,388
Cap and Shark were great,
but memories...

494
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,194
Shark changed linebacking forever!

495
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,794
He made a quantum leap in the game!

496
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,032
That's why we'll say goodbye
to both of them...

497
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,270
...with dignity, with class.

498
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,473
I won't cut Cap or Shark no matter
how much class you do it with.

499
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,240
My contract's very clear on this point.

500
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,596
I coach my way.

501
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,951
We make less money
than 90%%% of the other teams!

502
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,912
-The economics...
-Fuck the economics!

503
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,159
Your father, you hear me? Your father
didn't interfere! He made it work!

504
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,317
That's because you were a fighter.

505
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,437
You had intensity.

506
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,748
As much as I respect...

507
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,829
...my famous Uncle Tony...

508
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,516
...the players are just not
responding to you.

509
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,278
Art, may he rest in peace,
spent money like water.

510
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,358
But in the modern game
with the marketing costs...

511
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:56,314
Listen, I will do anything to bring
this team back to greatness.

512
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,473
I guess I had nothing to do with that.
That was all your dad.

513
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,113
Am I excused now?

514
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,068
Jeez, who's playing the child now?

515
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,470
Everybody's got to renegotiate,
and that means you too.

516
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,190
Are you saying my contract's up
at the end of the season?

517
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,908
The economics aren't there,
that what you're saying?

518
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,908
You know, you're not giving me
a whole lot to work with.

519
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:38,153
You know how your dad and I negotiated
my contract? We had a beer.

520
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,919
We shook hands.

521
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,631
Well, I don't drink beer, Tony.

522
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,996
I don't imagine you do, no.

523
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,632
Fucking beer?!

524
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,394
Fourteen to three, Chicago.
Second quarter.

525
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,278
Eight minutes left.

526
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,397
Oh, man! Bad, bad pass.

527
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,189
This has been a tough start
for Tyler Cherubini...

528
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,152
... who has yet to find his rhythm.

529
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,398
Tyler, we're in Miami.

530
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,273
You're throwing the ball to Georgia.
It's not clicking.

531
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,397
The offense isn't clicking.

532
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,512
-Rest it up.
-I can get it done.

533
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,994
I know you can. Not now.

534
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,149
What's going on?
Stop these sons of bitches!

535
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,076
Suck it up!

536
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,595
B.J., I'm gonna kick your ass!

537
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,269
Then I'll kick that million-dollar
bonus baby's ass!

538
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,598
Then I'll go in the stands
and kick both your mama's asses!

539
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,991
-Fumble. We got the ball.
-lt's ours.

540
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,988
Get Beamen.

541
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,473
You feel like throwing up?

542
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,751
Last time you puked,
you had a hell of a game.

543
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,076
Make a ritual out of it,
people will respect you.

544
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,039
We'll go at them.
We're going with the script.

545
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,995
Focus.

546
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,468
Concentration.

547
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,996
Downfield, downfield.
Every inch. Every inch.

548
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,760
You see it before you do it.
You see it, you do it.

549
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,430
Why'd you take so long?
This one's about to slip away.

550
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,073
Then go ahead. Let's go!

551
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,993
Make me a believer!

552
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,595
14-3, Chicago, second quarter,
3 minutes left.

553
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,794
Set!

554
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,234
Green 68! Hike!

555
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,237
Beamen's got the ball,
with room to run. Look at him go!

556
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,392
He's carrying it
like a loaf of bread.

557
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,960
This kid can move.
He's got some flexibility.

558
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,359
He's got genius ankles.

559
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,959
Look at him go!

560
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,314
That's what we need.

561
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,597
-A 57-yard carry by Willie Beamen.
-What the fuck is he doing?

562
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,993
Will somebody teach this kid
how to slide? He'll kill himself!

563
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,635
I don't need another Julian out there.

564
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,909
I understand.

565
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,754
There goes breakfast.

566
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,994
He seemed confused.
What's he confused about?

567
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,519
What's 60 Bravo?

568
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,835
Red Draw, Regular Group.

569
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,958
That was your play. Twins Right
3 Zig 88, throw ball on one. Ready?

570
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,428
Beamen walks to the line of scrimmage.
Three minutes left, 14-3 Chicago.

571
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,719
Green 68! Hike!

572
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,519
Touchdown, Miami!

573
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,319
I don't know what he's doing.
I didn't call that play.

574
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,720
-My touchdown!
-lt was yours, it was yours.

575
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,433
What the hell was that?

576
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,072
-lt was a bootleg.
-I know it was a goddamn bootleg!

577
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,555
I'm glad there's no microphone
down there.

578
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,637
I wouldn't want to be
on D'Amato's dark side.

579
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:12,276
I didn't call that play.
I called a Regular 22 Fox.

580
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,192
You know what that is, son?

581
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,398
Yeah, I know what that is.

582
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,911
You run the plays I call.

583
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,639
You with me, son?

584
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,153
Yeah, I'm with you, boss.

585
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,469
I'm with you.

586
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,635
Green 68!

587
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,753
Sharks first and goal at the 8.

588
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,196
We'll see what the offense puts
together against this Rhino defense.

589
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,558
What the hell...?

590
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,070
Crozier, what's he doing?

591
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,953
I don't know what he's doing.

592
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,829
Watch 55!

593
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,590
Set!

594
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,919
Black 33, hike!

595
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,956
Beamen back to pass,
the rush is on.

596
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,199
Got good protection.
He's rolling out right in a bootleg.

597
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,758
He pulls it down!
There's room to run!

598
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,392
He's got some daylight.
He's going for it!

599
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,234
It looks like they got him!

600
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,836
Yes! What the hell was that?!

601
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,316
Holy mackerel! That is football!

602
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,309
If I'm Tony D'Amato right now,
I'm praying to the football gods:

603
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,949
"What did I ever do to deserve this?"

604
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,475
"A new breed of athlete...

605
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,193
...and man.

606
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,230
The future.

607
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,515
Welcome to the 21st century."

608
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,439
Sharks, baby!

609
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,079
-What's the name of my team?!
-Sharks!

610
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,512
Why didn't you kick?

611
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,389
You should've kicked!

612
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,114
Cap, you gonna be ready for playoffs?

613
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,392
I've always been a quick healer.
I'll be there.

614
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,229
-You should've kicked.
-I'll be back. I just saw somebody...

615
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,314
It gives me great pleasure
to present D.A.R.E...

616
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:32,389
...with this $250,000 contribution.

617
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,036
The city of Miami thanks you,
Christina Pagniacci.

618
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,038
You are a great Miamian.

619
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,552
You've done as much as anyone...

620
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,951
...to eliminate drugs and crime
from our city streets.

621
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,675
And your Sharks have provided
wonderful role models...

622
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,429
...for our inner-city youth
to look up to. And I'm all for it!

623
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,675
And now...

624
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,997
...let's get down and party!

625
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,398
Where is that bold and beautiful
quarterback of yours?

626
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,114
Say hello to His Honor.

627
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,754
-Good to see you, sir.
-Show me some love.

628
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:34,910
Absolutely.

629
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,159
You know my wife, Cindy?

630
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,073
-lt's so nice to see you.
-Nice to see you.

631
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,958
I mean the other quarterback.
You know, the black dude?

632
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,959
-Who?
-He means Willie.

633
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,714
Of course, of course.

634
00:43:58,920 --> 00:43:59,796
Dexamethasone?

635
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,594
And extra-strength hydrocodeine.

636
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,071
That mix makes Jimmy crazy.
Can't get it up!

637
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,032
Count your blessings.

638
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,868
Is Willie managing to keep
his food down tonight?

639
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,958
Yeah, he's fine.
I'm Vanessa Struthers.

640
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,549
Jack got such a laugh off that one.

641
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,148
Jimmy had to order new shoes.

642
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,068
I'm Jamie Lasseter.

643
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,839
Heather Sanderson.

644
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,833
Are you and Willie married?

645
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,792
No, but we've been together for six...

646
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,752
Doesn't count until you're married...

647
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,270
...or until you get your name
in the paper as "and wife."

648
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,313
J, did I ever tell you
what this bitch said about me?

649
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,398
Where's your handkerchief?

650
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,234
Bitch says,
"Your sausage ain't right."

651
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,756
That shit bummed me out, man.
I went to a shrink.

652
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,878
Next time, use a handkerchief.

653
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,437
Motherfuckers might have AIDS!

654
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,358
-Woman beater!
-Let's go, let's go.

655
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,595
Asshole!

656
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,711
Let's get out
before she goes public.

657
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,229
Motherfucker!

658
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,471
Fuck you! Fuck you!

659
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:13,999
Be proud, son.
You are the future of football now.

660
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,953
You are a model for your people now,
Willie Beamen.

661
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,753
A black man unafraid.

662
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,319
Stand tall.

663
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,155
Give me some love!

664
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,719
-You pretty cool too, mayor.
-Thank you.

665
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,956
It's great to see you again. Welcome.

666
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,115
Good to see you too.

667
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,469
-Are you married?
-I'm between marriages.

668
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,274
Between marriages?
What do you do for dick?

669
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,951
Can I be honest with you?

670
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,398
This is a waste of my time.

671
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:51,639
I come up with the edge we need, the
stats, the probabilities, each week.

672
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,195
I won't waste another season under Tony.

673
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,994
You won't, okay?

674
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,715
I promise.

675
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,549
Your team ain't doing
what the Dolphins are doing.

676
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,957
A new stadium is the last thing
on the city council's mind.

677
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,709
I'm not asking you to vote, T.J.
I'm asking you to deliver.

678
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,794
I want the 250 million you promised me.

679
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,513
I can get the rest with the bond.

680
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:22,280
Schools are howling for money,
roads need redoing.

681
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,714
If you're not there for us...

682
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,275
...we'd seriously consider
leaving this town.

683
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,189
Your lease has two more years,
so don't set fires you can't put out.

684
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,749
There are loopholes.
The stadium's falling apart.

685
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,999
You haven't contributed one penny
to the maintenance on that relic.

686
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:41,751
Now that's the Pagniacci I believe.
I see your teeth. Get down, girl.

687
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:45,475
You are a relative babe
in this town. Go slow.

688
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,195
First you get along, then you go along.

689
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,874
Come on, darling.

690
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:54,072
We are a pro team, and we're losing
a ton of fucking money.

691
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,153
"Life begins with a kickoff" ...

692
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,913
...Art used to say.

693
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,390
-That's Artie.
-He was football, Margaret.

694
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,953
I know.

695
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,591
Now all we have are these...

696
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,037
...know-it-all ESPN analysts.

697
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:17,999
I've just been knighted.

698
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,758
Come on, Mom. Let's go.

699
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,756
Why do we have to leave?
It's not late.

700
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,228
It's getting there.

701
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,195
I gotta give this back to you.

702
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,838
We gotta do this again!

703
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,758
Let's do it tomorrow night.

704
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,159
I remember when my dad
designed that ring.

705
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,960
Guess I'll have to wear mine
on a chain around my neck.

706
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,992
You got to win one first.

707
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,753
I was only trying to make...

708
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,075
No, just win one.

709
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,109
Good night!

710
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,312
See you later!

711
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,395
I saw you looking at
Heather Sanderson's ass!

712
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,192
Why didn't you introduce her
to the mayor?

713
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,271
You damn sure didn't introduce me.

714
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,794
After all these years!

715
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,956
I'm not worried about them!

716
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,038
I'm not thinking about the mayor
or them crackhead assholes!

717
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,231
I'm thinking about the game!

718
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,631
What're you saying?
I don't look so good to you anymore?

719
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:37,071
You know, for a college graduate,
you're plumb dumb.

720
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,431
"Heather said this, Cindy said this!
Willie this and Willie that!"

721
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,595
Fuck!

722
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,268
You come at me
when I'm dealing with this shit?

723
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,072
Get the fuck out.

724
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,551
Get your hands off me.
What's wrong with you?

725
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,478
You gonna hit me now?

726
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,513
You're turning into a shit like
everybody on that team.

727
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,359
-I'm calling your mama!
-You're calling my mama?!

728
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:02,677
Girl, look. Don't let my success
go to your head, bitch!

729
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,355
Why not find a college motherfucker
you can hang out with?

730
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,912
What you worried about me for?
With that educated ass.

731
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,951
You're right. I am educated!

732
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:16,789
And your dumb country ass
can't even read a fucking playbook.

733
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,471
You can take your football, since
it's the only ball you got anyway...

734
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,398
...and stick it up your ass...

735
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,273
...because my beautiful ass
you won't be seeing anymore.

736
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:30,069
I'll be at Darlene's house.
She might fuck better than you, bitch!

737
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,635
-Get your dyke ass out!
-I'm not a dyke!

738
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,751
You got a nasty mouth on you too!

739
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,837
I don't want you around my kids...

740
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,554
...with that goddamn cussing and shit!

741
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,990
Fuck you, big-ass bitch!

742
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,596
Mind if I sit down for a minute?

743
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,113
What you listening to?

744
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,708
Rap.

745
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,035
Anyone I know?

746
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,559
Trick Daddy.

747
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,557
-You know him?
-Sure.

748
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,918
You ever listen to jazz?

749
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,869
You know, Coltrane, Monk...

750
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:28,638
...Miles Davis, Billie Holiday?

751
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:31,229
I don't get into the old stuff much.

752
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,793
Well, maybe I'll put together
a tape for you.

753
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,952
-My favorites...
-CDs.

754
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,078
These. CDs.

755
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,073
Forget about it then.

756
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,913
How about your mom?
Is she ever gonna come to a game?

757
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,915
Church.

758
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,469
She thinks that Sundays is for church.

759
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,838
Maybe you don't know this...

760
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,271
...but I lost my dad
when I was young too.

761
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,594
World War II.

762
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,754
If you ever want to talk
about that stuff...

763
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:17,919
...l'm around.

764
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,994
Deuce Right Split 25 Barrel Clear
on one.

765
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:57,596
I'm coming in fast.
Don't make me wait.

766
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,789
On one. Ready?

767
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,637
-What did he say?
-I don't speak Ebonics.

768
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:02,955
I don't speak Beamen.

769
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,151
-I got the outside backer?
-You got the nose.

770
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,953
Nose. Face.

771
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,152
They think that you are a bunch of
lowbrow Neanderthal shitheads!

772
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,273
They think they'll gut you and leave
you with your insides hanging out...

773
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:24,558
...so that the goddamn buzzards
can eat your no-playing asses!

774
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,159
You're gonna have a stroke!

775
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,875
I don't get strokes, motherfucker!
I give them!

776
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,548
Fumble! Oh, no!

777
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:36,233
There goes another one from J-man.
Or was it Willie Beamen?

778
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,399
Aw, come on!

779
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,476
Damn it!

780
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,750
-Snake Eyes Right, right?
-I was adjusting!

781
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,274
You didn't adjust shit!

782
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:51,077
I think McKenna's got a distended knee.
He's out.

783
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,474
He's out for how long?!

784
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,073
If he's lucky, Easter.

785
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:55,952
You didn't adjust shit!

786
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,750
Knock it off! Knock it off!

787
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:06,433
You realize that that little screwup
just cost us McKenna for the season!

788
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:10,838
Sit down, all of you!
Sit down and shut the fuck up!

789
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,959
They're leaking,
you don't know where. Fix it!

790
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,311
Don't scream, yell,
all that bullshit! Fix it!

791
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,512
What the fuck is wrong with you?

792
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,593
Where'd you find this faggot?

793
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,634
-I had to get that out of my system.
-Don't do it on my shoes.

794
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:45,071
-On your period, you anorexic fucker?
-Yes, I am.

795
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,033
Right Deuce Dog 90 Smoke on three.

796
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,310
Jimmy, you're one. Ice, you're two.

797
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,518
Champagne, you can clear out.
J-man, take the flat.

798
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,073
Don't force it if you don't got it.

799
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,548
I'm a righteous fucker.
On three.

800
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,195
Wow, look at that block!

801
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,833
Perfect throw! Touchdown!

802
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,190
Touchdown pass,
Beamen to Sanderson.

803
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,238
Touchdown, Beamen.
Touchdown, Sharks!

804
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,035
Strong right!

805
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,837
Will you get someone to block 58?

806
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:01,756
Turn it up!

807
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:05,516
Punting team. Jesus!

808
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,273
Right Deuce Gun, F-shoot 60 Snake Eyes
on three.

809
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,078
You run Snake Eyes in the red zone.

810
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,430
Get on my page or shut the fuck up.

811
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:16,436
On three. Ready?

812
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,789
Under incredible pressure,
off his back foot!

813
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,514
Sixty yards! Touchdown!

814
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:51,829
Playoffs!

815
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,878
Playoffs, New York
and home-field advantage.

816
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,389
As the Sharks go into
their bye week...

817
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,318
...the story's gotta be
Willie Beamen.

818
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:00,709
He's running. He's throwing.

819
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:03,593
He's rocking and rolling,
chucking and jiving.

820
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:07,190
He's flat-out steaming. This magic
Sunday, he's Steamin' Beamen.

821
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,159
Hell, no.
Not this Nazi rock shit again!

822
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,469
Metallica rules!

823
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,989
Hetfield is God.
We live to serve him.

824
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,998
You should bow down
to the monsters of rock!

825
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,071
That's right, bitch!

826
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,591
Can you feel the intensity, baby?!

827
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,597
We did something exceptional today.

828
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,189
We were under pressure, and we did it.

829
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,359
Come Wednesday,
we got one thing on our minds.

830
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,470
One thing, victory!

831
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,069
We wanna feel this way again,
don't we?

832
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,115
Hey, guys.

833
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,270
-Clark. Great game.
-Appreciate it.

834
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,754
Where's Beamen at?

835
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,473
He's down there.

836
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,030
How's it going?

837
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:30,468
Hey, Cap.

838
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,234
J.J., great game.
Looking really good out there.

839
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,511
Pete, don't stiffen up on me.

840
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:47,553
Congratulations. You were great.
Really exciting to watch out there.

841
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,671
Well, you know, I thrill to chill.

842
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,792
You can't dance!

843
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,636
Get off the juice,
you'll get a little loose!

844
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:01,400
Fuck you. Fuck you.
It's like that?

845
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,949
I'll be back. I'll be back.

846
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,518
I hope you don't think this is rude.

847
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,633
You know, I don't B.S., Miss Pagnicci.

848
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,029
You do it to me.

849
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:19,038
I was wondering if we could go out
for a drink or something, hang.

850
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,232
-I'm flattered. Really, I am.
-You should be.

851
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:26,916
But I've never dated players.
It gives the wrong impression.

852
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,999
I guess you're saying you're
influenced by what other people think.

853
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,155
I think we all are, in business.

854
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,075
And it's...

855
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,159
..."Pagniacci."

856
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,634
Eat this, you fucking pussies!

857
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,159
I'm sorry, baby, I'm sorry!

858
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,592
Reebok's got this ad campaign...

859
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:01,509
...ready to go the moment I hit
2000 yards. But it's ABC, man.

860
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:05,679
I don't get the ball, I don't get
my stats, I don't get my money.

861
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,757
This team isn't about your damn stats.

862
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,473
That's a winning attitude, J.

863
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,955
How much you paying that
300-pound blocker?

864
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:13,794
Let him block.

865
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,911
Because he sure can't run like I can.

866
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,439
J-man's got a point.

867
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:18,789
Beamen ain't doing his homework.

868
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,468
He won't read the playbook,
he won't come see the films.

869
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,877
He doesn't even know the names
of the defense he's facing.

870
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,630
He don't give
a gee-whiz about anybody.

871
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,558
He just wants
to make the plays himself.

872
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,479
He's young, Cap.
He doesn't know how to read like you.

873
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:36,195
What do you mean, he's young?
Come on! He just does what he likes.

874
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:40,678
He's changing the plays in the huddle.
Plays that you designed, that I love.

875
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:44,555
He's dissing this play and dissing
that play. "I got a better play!"

876
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,273
Guys, we won.

877
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,035
What's the point?

878
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:50,396
I'm trying to get paid!
That's the point!

879
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,637
The point is, if we don't win,
you can't do your commercials.

880
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:56,713
What do you know?
You're an offensive coordinator!

881
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,435
Jesus Christ.

882
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,517
Keep your mouth shut.

883
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:04,395
Get this shit straight, coach.
I'm with you, man.

884
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,874
It's all right, J.

885
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,839
Anything else?

886
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,748
Hey, guess what?

887
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:16,588
Coach suddenly invited me
over for dinner.

888
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,911
Or orders me, more like.

889
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,071
That means you made it, boy.

890
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:24,836
The coach thinks you're the real deal,
invites you to his house...

891
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,837
...makes the worst jambalaya.

892
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,997
Better bring some flowers.

893
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:32,198
Coach gets really pissed off
if you don't bring flowers.

894
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,515
Flowers?

895
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:35,788
Trust me, man.

896
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:36,955
When?

897
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,195
Saturday.

898
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,598
That's tight, man.
Got a gig over at my house.

899
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,279
Going to be a lot of trim.

900
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,037
Don't bring no sand to the beach.

901
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:49,879
Come on, I'm a born-again ladies' man.

902
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,036
I bet you were born again, baby.

903
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:58,918
With a team, hotshot, you can try
to lead them, but will anyone follow?

904
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:02,949
You go out there on your own,
you're gonna die a very lonely death.

905
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:04,389
You feeling me?

906
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,919
Say, Cap, how old are you again?

907
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:15,397
We got a problem.
There's something wrong with Shark.

908
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,989
Brilliant. Did you
go to medical school for that?

909
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,953
His eye-hand coordination's
deteriorating.

910
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:25,039
He's fucked up. The crazier they are,
the more the crowd likes it.

911
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:27,834
This isn't pro wrestling.
He needs an MRI.

912
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:32,670
You gonna order a $20,000 workup
for every nutcase on this team?

913
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:35,269
Could have a subdural hematoma,
intracranial bleeding.

914
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,875
Or he could just be
a crazy fucker, okay?

915
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,553
They walk on that field every Sunday.

916
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,389
They got only one thing going for them:
their confidence.

917
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:46,433
You chip away at that
with a bunch of unnecessary testing...

918
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,676
...and we can kiss
the playoffs goodbye.

919
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,110
Are you saying
I can't do the tests on Shark?

920
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,673
Jesus Christ!

921
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,477
I'll take care of it.

922
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,956
I have earned their trust.
You haven't. Good night.

923
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:01,709
Hey, baby.

924
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,438
-What's the matter?
-Who's Courtney?

925
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:08,110
I don't know who Courtney is.
Why are you starting your shit?

926
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:14,590
What's it like to be a nobody one day
and have the world know you the next?

927
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,758
I was always a star.
Y'all just didn't know about it.

928
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,234
It ain't the whole world.

929
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:21,994
Two billion people in China
ain't never heard of the game.

930
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:24,033
Sharks are in the water.

931
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:36,198
The busboy, Steamin' Beamen.
What you think?

932
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,913
It's all to the good.

933
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:41,510
Let's get out of here.
This studio time ain't cheap.

934
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,555
Take over.
I'll be doing this every day.

935
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,035
Gotta get to work

936
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:40,629
That's right

937
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:44,390
You know my name

938
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:45,795
My name is Willie

939
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:46,836
Willie Beamen

940
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,189
I keep the ladies

941
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:49,510
Creamin'

942
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:51,950
-And all my fans
-Got 'em screamin'

943
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:53,991
-Think you can defeat me?
-You're dreamin'

944
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:56,755
Get set, motherfucker.

945
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,752
Then we can get in the gym.

946
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,235
Give generously
to Child Find of America.

947
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:10,677
And let's make every kid
feel like a superstar.

948
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,194
You should have fought for
that "superstar" line.

949
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,636
"Giving." "Team sport."

950
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,273
Those are the lines.

951
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:27,431
Meanwhile, honey,
you used to do this spot alone.

952
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,069
Finished?

953
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,633
Take care of Julian for me?

954
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:44,915
I know this guy.

955
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:46,559
He's a top plastic surgeon.

956
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,556
I think I could get him
to see you tonight.

957
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:54,192
Oh, motherfucker!

958
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,117
Inflate your chest. Get MET-Rx.

959
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:28,839
Yo, Rocky.

960
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,675
Enough. You're gonna hurt yourself.

961
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:35,551
Kid's breathing down my neck.

962
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,631
Jack, he's not even close.

963
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,073
You're the man.

964
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:46,989
-Less on the ball, Willie.
-What?

965
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,350
You want a cool, tight spiral.
Don't pat the ball.

966
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,869
It was tight as a frog's ass.
I'm the man.

967
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:55,231
You're the man. I repeat, don't
pat the ball. What'd he say?

968
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:57,596
I said, "I'm as tight as fish pussy."

969
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:59,632
I need an interpreter.

970
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,513
Okay, Cap. Sit down.

971
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:05,988
I'm fine. Fine.

972
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,474
You got the balls.

973
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,716
Come on, just get some rest.
Let's go.

974
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:14,716
Bottom line, Rooney is like
some kind of medical miracle.

975
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,991
He really could be ready for New York.

976
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:18,829
Have you told anyone?

977
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:21,235
I've been on for 12 years
and two rings.

978
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,910
Give me a break. I played hurt before.
It's no big deal.

979
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:28,669
He's so freaked about Beamen taking his
job, he'd play with a fractured neck.

980
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,228
Could you slow him down?

981
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:34,598
Tell him he's not responding
to rehab well enough.

982
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,119
Let's give Beamen a shot.

983
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,436
We're going with Willie
against New York.

984
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:40,879
Rest up till the playoffs.

985
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,594
The Emperors don't mean enough for you
to risk everything.

986
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:46,314
Home-field advantage.
That don't mean anything?

987
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:51,438
Everyone knows
herniated discs are iffy.

988
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,119
This is how it starts, huh?

989
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:57,436
I know what you're talking about.
I know how your mind works.

990
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:59,949
"Rest up."
"Let the kid take a few games."

991
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,513
"You were great, but time marches on."

992
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:03,790
-That's not what I'm saying.
-The heck you're not.

993
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,592
I know the game of football.

994
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,712
-What about Shark?
-He's woozy still.

995
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:11,832
He's got bad migraines,
postconcussive syndrome.

996
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:14,634
Don't get a hard-on. Don't move.

997
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:15,875
Can you clear him?

998
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:20,031
He's had 3 concussions in 5 months.

999
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:23,314
There's no way to predict what
another head hit would do.

1000
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:27,158
I don't think anything'll happen,
but I'm not a complete prick.

1001
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:28,799
I do have a conscience.

1002
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,230
I'm not trying to screw him, Harvey...

1003
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,038
...but I'd like him in the playoffs.

1004
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,158
Long-term, what are you thinking?

1005
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,279
What am I thinking?

1006
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,079
Bottom line?

1007
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:44,951
We'll cut him in the off-season.

1008
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,508
The word's out.
Everyone's seen him take the hits.

1009
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,719
Nobody's gonna sign a
two-million-dollar concussion case.

1010
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:55,551
He'll be happy to have his job back
at 30% of what he makes.

1011
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,473
That's if we want him back.

1012
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,477
He's got four kids, Christina.

1013
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:02,832
You do the math, doctor.

1014
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:08,711
What you help save us now,
we won't forget at contract time.

1015
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,073
What do I tell Tony?

1016
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,432
Tell him what he needs to know.

1017
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,911
Shark can play. Cap can't.

1018
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:25,638
...in these high beautiful heels.

1019
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:30,154
-You know what you need?
-A pump.

1020
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:34,190
You need to be...

1021
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:35,874
...young again!

1022
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,599
You got me!

1023
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:45,392
I like going downfield.
That's my game. I open it wide open.

1024
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:49,394
The fans want it. Old-timers
don't dig it, like Coach Stone Age.

1025
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:53,553
I beg your pardon? "Coach Stone Age"?
Is that what you just said?

1026
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:55,478
It's up and it's good, baby!

1027
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:57,875
That's a name I give him.
I don't mean disrespect.

1028
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,116
Tell me about your past.
Where did you start?

1029
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:03,591
In Houston, but the coach didn't dig
having a black quarterback.

1030
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:07,076
I guess he felt our brains
was no bigger than the tip of his...

1031
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,998
And then I went to San Diego.

1032
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,794
Coach made me cornerback
because he felt I had quick feet.

1033
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,275
No, wait. Leave him on. He's cool.

1034
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:16,155
"Cool"?

1035
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,028
Thinks he's Joe Montana already.

1036
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:20,559
They didn't know what I was.

1037
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:25,432
I mean, he doesn't buy into the
bullshit, you know? I like his eyes.

1038
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:28,074
Life ain't fair.
And fair ain't what I'm here for.

1039
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:31,228
He's sure of himself.
It makes him sexy.

1040
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,751
I'm glad I'm old.

1041
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:36,149
Check all right?

1042
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:40,518
I'm not surprised. Rookie thinks he's
hot shit and all-pro all of a sudden.

1043
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,592
Did you feed the dogs?

1044
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,836
-Put the kids to bed.
-Can't we afford a maid?

1045
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:47,314
Why'd I get married?

1046
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:52,274
Are you saying black people
are being dissed in this league?

1047
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:55,757
I see what you're doing.
You're doing that media spin.

1048
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:02,278
-How many black coaches do you have?
-Very few.

1049
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,198
-How many black owners?
-None.

1050
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:05,270
Zero.

1051
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:10,156
At what point does the "Uncle Tom"
feel come into it? Not my language...!

1052
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,595
It is because we didn't speak it
when we got here.

1053
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,717
But "Coach Stone Age"...?

1054
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:19,554
Your smack is so fresh, so on time
and truthful. Give me a pound, dog.

1055
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,756
-Share the love.
-I'll pass on the love.

1056
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:24,991
You get it started, okay?

1057
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:30,629
-Hope you like cream in your coffee.
-Yes, I do.

1058
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:34,275
Mandy...

1059
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:35,714
...I like you.

1060
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,428
I'm wondering,
maybe we could make this...

1061
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:42,108
...you know, a more regular thing.

1062
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:45,197
Yeah, I got a few clients like that.

1063
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:48,193
We could book a regular time.
I'll give you my number...

1064
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:51,193
No, I sort of meant...
Not like that.

1065
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:53,314
Without the money.

1066
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:02,474
-I know, but...
-No, you don't want to do this.

1067
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:04,033
I really like you.

1068
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:05,914
I like you too.

1069
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:08,111
Tony, you don't want to do this.

1070
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,748
Call me.

1071
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,677
You got pretty hair.

1072
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,035
-Got you flowers.
-These for me?

1073
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,196
-Thank you.
-Carnations.

1074
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:57,517
I'll put them in water or something.
Come on in.

1075
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,513
Want a beer?

1076
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:00,670
Yeah.

1077
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:03,436
Sharky motherfucker.

1078
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,074
Nice spot.

1079
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:07,235
Yeah, isn't it?

1080
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,875
The gladiators of their time.

1081
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:15,278
That's what it's all about.

1082
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:19,830
I don't cook so well,
but you gotta try this jambalaya.

1083
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,268
-Ready?
-I'm always ready.

1084
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:28,074
It was my recipe. Sort of.

1085
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,068
How do you like it?

1086
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,592
It's...hot.

1087
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,473
Let's talk about some basics.

1088
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:42,636
You getting ready to yell at me?

1089
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:45,596
Cap going down was tough on me.

1090
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:48,872
I realize you're learning the system.
Pressure must be incredible.

1091
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:50,638
-I can handle it.
-I know you can.

1092
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:54,152
If the playbook is too complicated,
we simplify it.

1093
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,310
Playbook's too slow.

1094
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:58,028
When I'm on the field,
I gotta feel it, gotta let it out.

1095
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:00,674
That why you've been changing the plays?

1096
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,279
I'm just trying to read the defense.

1097
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:05,836
I'm not talking about audibles.
Talking about in the huddle.

1098
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:09,753
When you change plays,
you show disrespect to people.

1099
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:13,157
People who have worked years
in this club.

1100
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:17,234
People who've sacrificed more than
you'll ever know to be in this game.

1101
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:18,759
I'm trying to win, coach!

1102
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:23,272
I ain't trying to disrespect nobody.
Winning is the only thing I respect.

1103
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,319
Listen very carefully.

1104
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:29,678
One day you'll realize this is
the truest thing you ever heard.

1105
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:31,839
This game...

1106
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:38,832
This game has got to be
about more than winning.

1107
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:41,633
You're part of something.

1108
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:44,991
Lombardi, Tittle, Sammy Baugh, Unitas.

1109
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:48,158
Those men on the wall.
You're part of that now.

1110
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:51,119
I want you to cherish it
because when it's gone...

1111
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:54,151
...it's gone forever.

1112
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:58,308
When I look at them pictures
and trophies, it just makes me sad.

1113
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:01,951
It's like a room full of ghosts.

1114
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,192
When I'm done with this game...

1115
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:07,750
...I don't want to be no ghost.
I wanna be more than that.

1116
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:16,712
Looks like Cap's gonna make it
back in time for the playoffs.

1117
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,675
-What?
-I'm gonna start him.

1118
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,789
I knew you were gonna sell me out.

1119
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,877
Cap's a leader. He's a team player.

1120
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:30,677
That's such bullshit!
He ain't half the athlete I am.

1121
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:34,350
You look me in the eye and tell me
that Cap is a better player.

1122
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:35,675
Cap's a better player.

1123
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:39,316
I guess somebody else
won them last two games.

1124
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:41,636
He lost four in a row!
I lead by doing.

1125
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:42,909
You kicked ass.

1126
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,680
But Cap Rooney has been doing it
for years.

1127
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:47,313
And his time is over.

1128
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,988
And yours is too,
unless you take some risk!

1129
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:52,031
Play this game the way
it's played today.

1130
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:54,196
It's not about
the pictures on the wall!

1131
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:57,034
I've lived this game
for three decades, kid!

1132
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:58,195
I know football.

1133
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,673
-Those men on the wall...
-They wanted to win.

1134
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:03,189
Just like you do.

1135
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:07,758
You can feed the press that whole
sacrifice and glory-of-the-game crap.

1136
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:09,075
But I been there.

1137
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:11,836
I seen a long line of coaches...

1138
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:14,634
...with that same old bullshit
halftime speech.

1139
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,558
-Bullshit?
-Yes, it's bullshit.

1140
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:19,797
You know it's bullshit
because it's about the money.

1141
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,912
The TV contracts,
fat-cat boosters in the skyboxes.

1142
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:24,439
Coaches trying to up their salaries.

1143
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:27,950
You looking for the next black stud
to take it to the top 10.

1144
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,713
Get you in a bowl game.

1145
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:34,236
It's the same way in the pros.

1146
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:38,158
Except in the pros,
the field hands get paid.

1147
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,436
Don't play that race card on me, kid.

1148
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,676
25 years I work with men
of your color.

1149
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:45,348
Maybe it's not racism.
Maybe it's placism.

1150
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:47,551
Brother has to know his place.
Right, boss?

1151
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:50,110
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

1152
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:53,319
You don't trust anybody
because of what happened in college?

1153
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:56,512
You knew the rules.
You were the one that broke them.

1154
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:58,870
-How did I break them?
-How?

1155
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:02,073
I lost a million-dollar
signing bonus...

1156
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:06,393
...because I took a $300 suit
from a booster to go to a wedding.

1157
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,951
What's a brother supposed to do
in college? He ain't got money.

1158
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:13,516
He wants to go out on a date.
Wants to get some nice clothes.

1159
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,911
Everybody had their hands out...

1160
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:17,792
...but it was me they suspended.

1161
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:20,714
I dropped six rounds in the draft
because of that.

1162
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:24,754
The coaches labeled me: "He's trouble.
He don't wanna play ball."

1163
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,154
You talk about sacrifice.

1164
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:30,359
I sacrificed $10 million because dumb
rednecks like the coach in San Diego...

1165
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:32,357
...made me a cornerback
because I got quick feet.

1166
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:35,438
He separated my shoulder tackling
250-pound motherfuckers.

1167
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:36,595
I don't do that!

1168
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:39,792
I was a great football player.

1169
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:44,153
But nobody let my shoulder heal,
and they traded me out of there.

1170
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:47,159
You go ahead.
Blame everybody but yourself.

1171
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:48,230
Whatever.

1172
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:51,119
Because that's what a leader's about.
Sacrifice.

1173
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:55,956
The times he's gotta sacrifice
because he's gotta lead by example.

1174
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:58,196
Not by fear and not by self-pity.

1175
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,308
Who you think you're talking to?

1176
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:04,432
Half my career is over
and you want me on the bench...

1177
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:07,712
...to sacrifice for the glory
of Cap Rooney? Fuck you!

1178
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:09,593
I ain't buying your brand.

1179
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,797
Just because you some scared old man.

1180
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,151
You feel like if I play my way,
I just might win.

1181
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,595
Then what was your life about anyway?

1182
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:23,679
You're not some flash-in-the-pan
corner or receiver...

1183
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:27,793
...or even Julian Washington.
You're a goddamn quarterback!

1184
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,672
You know what that means?!

1185
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:33,991
It's the top spot, kid.

1186
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:35,872
It's the guy takes the fall.

1187
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:40,232
It's the guy everybody's looking at
first, the leader of a team.

1188
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:42,829
Who will support you
when they understand you.

1189
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:46,350
Who will break their ribs and their
noses and their necks for you...

1190
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:50,553
...because they believe.
Because you make them believe.

1191
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,479
That's a quarterback.

1192
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:03,357
I'm the leader of your team...

1193
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:05,394
...till Cap's back up.

1194
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:08,192
Then I'm back on the bench.

1195
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:11,797
You ain't said two words to me
till Cherubini went down.

1196
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,952
Then it was, "Go out there and...

1197
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:18,552
...play like you're in the 'hood.
You're throwing the ball...

1198
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:21,480
...and your mama's
ringing the dinner bell."

1199
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,558
All you do is talk at me, man.

1200
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:28,832
I'm gonna stay who I am.
Steamin' Willie Beamen.

1201
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:33,035
With the time I got left,
I'll play my way. Get my dollars up.

1202
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:36,994
So when you go to waive me, trade me
or whatever the fuck y'all do...

1203
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:40,795
...l'll be worth 10 times what
I was worth before I got here.

1204
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:43,916
You're very, very young.

1205
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,912
And you're very, very stupid.

1206
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:02,557
What're you doing? Get off the lawn!

1207
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:05,071
It's Mr. Beamen. Willie, how you doing?

1208
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:20,078
It's about winning. That's what this
country's about. Being number one.

1209
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:24,110
This whole country was built
on kicking immigrant ass.

1210
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:27,153
African ass, Chinese ass.

1211
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:28,588
Don't matter who ass.

1212
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:30,999
Get the fuck out!

1213
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:34,191
Get the fuck out of here, bitch!

1214
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:36,113
Every kid can grow up
to be President, right?

1215
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,960
Who the hell want to grow up
and be vice president?

1216
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:41,355
There ain't no number twos
in football.

1217
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:44,393
Homeboy! Welcome to the pit!

1218
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:46,955
You come to my house,
you bring me no flowers?

1219
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:48,115
You played me.

1220
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:51,790
Blowjobs upstairs. If you want
the skin, trawl the beach.

1221
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:54,515
Don't mess the sheets.
My wife's back on Tuesday.

1222
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:57,234
-I won't spill a drop.
-Hey, no semen, no blood.

1223
01:19:58,680 --> 01:19:59,749
Goddamn!

1224
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:04,320
You tell me.
Who lost the Pantheon Cup last year?

1225
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:07,239
Who came in second
at the 100-yard dash in the Olympics?

1226
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:10,631
Where I'm from, either you're
number one, or you ain't sh...!

1227
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:12,068
That's a fact.

1228
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:15,676
Did you get
the Vince Lombardi speech?

1229
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:17,632
He was in my face
like we lost the game.

1230
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:21,879
I got out of Dallas because
I worked harder than anybody else.

1231
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:26,433
You make it and get the big car,
or you don't and catch the bus...

1232
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:29,552
...and you in the funeral home,
because to me, losing is dying.

1233
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:31,836
"Losing is dying".
I am down with that!

1234
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:35,237
I think we'd be top dog
if the defense would step up.

1235
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:38,711
Lay off the D, man. Shark hear you
saying that, he'll kick your ass.

1236
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:42,196
Like I give a fuck.
I'm trying to win some games.

1237
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,630
I ain't trying to kiss
no overrated loser's ass.

1238
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:47,435
What you care about?
You playing for yourself.

1239
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:49,312
What you talking about, punk?

1240
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,829
You gotta earn the right
to diss somebody on this team.

1241
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:54,354
You call this a team?

1242
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:57,114
I see a bunch of super-fly
brothers running around...

1243
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:58,952
...living in the white man's world...

1244
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:00,798
...getting their dicks sucked by ho's.

1245
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,798
J, you were a great football player.

1246
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:05,798
Now you done turn into a joke.

1247
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,038
You're playing,
but you're dying inside.

1248
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:10,151
What the fuck you mean,
I'm dying inside?

1249
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:14,996
Kiss my Armani ass! Know what I did for
this team? I'll take your life, man!

1250
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:17,555
Football is a corporation.

1251
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:21,032
Black kids are raised
to be stars, individuals.

1252
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:24,232
They do not learn to work together.

1253
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:26,715
-Beamen's talking shit about you.
-What?!

1254
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:30,356
Talking about how we'd be on top
if the defense would do their job.

1255
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,119
Fucking kidding me!

1256
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:35,710
Motherfucker! I'll break a piece
off in his goddamn ass!

1257
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:04,917
What the fuck is wrong with you,
motherfucker?!

1258
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:08,234
In football, you have
the offense and the defense.

1259
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:10,198
You can't have one without the other.

1260
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:11,435
Respect will be paid!

1261
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:14,359
Somebody call you a cab.
Get out of my house!

1262
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:17,996
But isn't this an awesome New York
pass rush coming at you?

1263
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:20,031
When you're out there,
is the fear in the belly?

1264
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:23,232
The fear and the terror.
No, I don't feel none of that.

1265
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:28,033
They won't touch me. They won't
feel me. They won't even smell me.

1266
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:31,391
I don't care if it's the T-Rex
or the Terminator chasing me.

1267
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:34,353
I got this invisible juice.
Once I turn it on, I'm gone.

1268
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:51,878
Stay down, motherfucker.

1269
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:55,757
Beamen is sacked again.
He goes down hard.

1270
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,115
They won't play for him, Tony.

1271
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,311
Let him fucking learn, then!

1272
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:11,390
Welcome back
to the Monsoon Bowl, folks.

1273
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,239
The Emperors have been eating
Shark patties all night long.

1274
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:17,352
Smash-mouth football.
This is what it's all about.

1275
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:24,712
Halfback up the middle.
Lavay steps up to fill the gap...

1276
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:26,558
...misses the tackle.

1277
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:30,832
The Emperors block their way
into the end zone. It's a touchdown.

1278
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:35,237
Good job, offense! Way to play!

1279
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:40,079
Just about everything that can
go wrong has here today.

1280
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,390
Murphy's Law in effect
for Tony D'Amato.

1281
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,989
Can I get some fucking protection?!

1282
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:47,316
If you're not blocking,
get the fuck out the way!

1283
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,476
Loudmouth showboat motherfucker!

1284
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:51,956
Where's your steam now, Willie?

1285
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,991
You fuckers wanna make it tough?!

1286
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:57,078
I can take that shit.

1287
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,880
Come contract time,
there'll be a whole bunch of changes!

1288
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:02,195
Just give us the play.

1289
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:05,352
It'll be you or me.
And it ain't gonna be me.

1290
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:32,153
And there goes home-field advantage
for the Sharks.

1291
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:35,915
Although their season ends on a low
note, there's still life after death.

1292
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:37,917
Look for them in the playoffs...

1293
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:41,911
...in Tough Town, U.S.A.:
Dallas, Texas.

1294
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:45,556
There goes that black dynasty
you promised me, darling.

1295
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,319
What's the matter?
Forgot your invisible juice?

1296
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:11,752
Stop this now!

1297
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,150
Thirty years in football...

1298
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:29,831
...I never seen something
stinks like this!

1299
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:34,997
Today out there...

1300
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:37,596
...you embarrassed yourselves.

1301
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,353
Today...

1302
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:42,037
...l'm ashamed to be your coach.

1303
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:55,112
Lucky for him, some of these Sharks
still have teeth left in their head.

1304
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,590
Tell you the truth,
they remind me of my ex.

1305
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:00,196
I don't know what more I can do.

1306
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:04,675
Doesn't make sense,
my not having a home. A life.

1307
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:09,436
Game's all that matters to me.

1308
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,956
Because it's pure.

1309
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:15,238
Four quarters.
You cross a line, you score.

1310
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,239
It's sane. Life isn't.

1311
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:25,952
Life is fucked.

1312
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,638
It's a new world, Tony.

1313
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:34,155
In my day, we used to just be happy
to get the goddamn job.

1314
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:37,150
I used to shovel liquor
in the off-season.

1315
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,874
You know, sell used cars, insurance.

1316
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:42,836
Some of the guys used to even wrestle.

1317
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:46,077
But, shit, now, prima dogs.

1318
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:51,391
Bodies that are year-round great,
but crack just like china.

1319
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:53,109
It's TV.

1320
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:55,359
Changed everything.

1321
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,795
Changed the way we think forever.

1322
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:00,509
I mean, the first time
they stopped the game...

1323
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:03,837
...to cut away to a fucking commercial,
that was the end of it.

1324
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:07,077
Because it was our concentration
that mattered, not theirs.

1325
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:10,949
Not some fruitcake selling cereal.

1326
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:17,476
Who wants to think about blitzes
when you're holding your grandkids?

1327
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:22,074
You gonna miss your friend
screaming in your face...

1328
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:25,153
...embarrassing you
in front of your players?

1329
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:28,796
That's why I wanna coach high school.

1330
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:31,396
Get back to the basics.

1331
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:34,993
Kids don't know nothing.
They just wanna play.

1332
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,957
Like you said, Tony...

1333
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:40,513
...it's pure.

1334
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,353
So what are the odds?

1335
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:09,198
Well, there's no telling.

1336
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:11,113
It's an odontoid fracture.

1337
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:15,957
Basically, Luther, you broke your neck,
and it never healed correctly.

1338
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:19,516
It's hard to predict
this kind of thing...

1339
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:23,793
...but what I can say is
that the wrong kind of hit...

1340
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:27,359
...could result
in paralysis, seizures...

1341
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:30,074
...even sudden death.

1342
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:33,554
What else is new?

1343
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:34,795
In my opinion...

1344
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:37,071
...he is not medically fit to play.

1345
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:39,356
I need one sack
and three more tackles...

1346
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:42,632
...and I get my bonus. Then we'll talk.
Okay, motherfucker?

1347
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,032
Come on, Luther.

1348
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:48,358
Have you ever seen
an old punch-drunk boxer...

1349
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,755
...stumbling around drooling...

1350
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:54,309
...with no memory of
what he's done in his life?

1351
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:56,676
You want that life, Luther?

1352
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:02,272
You need me against Texas, don't you?

1353
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:03,435
Don't you?

1354
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:06,519
Of course I need you against Texas,
but not...

1355
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,672
...not at this price, no.

1356
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:14,439
For a million dollars, I will shake
like a coconut on a tree if I got to.

1357
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:18,158
Coach, I gave you 13 years.
You can give me one.

1358
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:21,913
Football's my life, coach.
It's my life.

1359
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:25,512
It's all I know how to do.

1360
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:27,439
Please, man.

1361
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:30,472
Come on, coach, please.

1362
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:40,998
You have to sign a waiver, Shark.

1363
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,995
Bring it on, man. Bring it on.

1364
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:47,555
Coach.

1365
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:51,795
We need to have
a discussion about Harvey.

1366
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:56,033
Where the hell's D'Amato?

1367
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:03,036
Don't you ever say that
your papa didn't believe in you.

1368
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:04,798
Don't believe what your mom says.

1369
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,991
You evil motherfucker!
Come over here.

1370
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:10,513
Shark's film.

1371
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,112
I know what you did, asshole!

1372
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:16,591
You switched the results
so Powers wouldn't pick up on it.

1373
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:18,472
Princess, I'll call you right back.

1374
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:21,114
Granted, it could look that way
to a layperson.

1375
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:22,389
I want you out of here!

1376
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:23,794
You're taking the high road?

1377
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,878
You didn't consult with him!
He could get killed out there!

1378
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:28,195
You didn't consult with him?!

1379
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:31,153
I'm gonna consult with a player?
I knew his answer!

1380
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:34,193
Getting killed? Maybe, maybe not.
One chance in 1000.

1381
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:36,152
But nobody blitzes
like the Shark, right?

1382
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:38,868
I never wanna see you near
one of my players again!

1383
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:43,039
They couldn't take a piss
in the morning without their pills!

1384
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:46,238
You're gonna play innocent?
Fuck your innocence!

1385
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:48,715
What about Beyer?
Or Nielstrom and Manzicki?

1386
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:50,718
Logan and Krause?

1387
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:53,150
I will not have this discussion
with you!

1388
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:56,233
You don't wanna hear the answer?
Don't ask the question!

1389
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:58,193
And you, you fucking snitch.

1390
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:00,755
Did you ever think about Shark
putting food on the table?

1391
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:01,836
You lied to him.

1392
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:03,359
You didn't give him a choice.

1393
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:06,029
-lt's a doctor's ethics.
-Since when?

1394
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,038
The Hippocratic oath, that's when.

1395
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:09,798
The one that starts, "Do no harm"?

1396
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:13,749
With all due respect, I didn't
have to ask because I knew the answer.

1397
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:16,838
Who am I to tell these men
they cannot live their dream?

1398
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:18,952
They will not live with shame like you.

1399
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:21,515
They are gladiators.
They are warriors!

1400
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:23,756
And long ago, they made that choice.

1401
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:25,632
Not you! Not you!

1402
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:30,670
Not me. I won't be responsible
for standing between them...

1403
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:36,799
Didn't you ever have...

1404
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:39,279
...a dream, Ollie?

1405
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:41,072
I'm living it, Harv.

1406
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:47,435
Oh, fuck it.

1407
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:50,634
We did win the Pantheon though,
didn't we?

1408
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:53,110
See you around the old nursing homes.

1409
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:54,594
Courtney, let's go.

1410
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:57,157
No. I'm gonna stay here.

1411
01:31:57,880 --> 01:31:59,677
-What?
-Please.

1412
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:00,869
Perfect. Stay here.

1413
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:05,073
And get butt-fucked by
twelve Neanderthals. Bitch!

1414
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:09,753
Coach D., what do you say?

1415
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:10,790
Out of my way!

1416
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:14,318
Well, that's just great.

1417
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:17,029
That's just fucking great!

1418
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:19,155
Did you get that?

1419
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:31,356
Nobody's gonna hit your pussy-ass.

1420
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:34,836
I know, man. I just got happy feet.
I'm getting old.

1421
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:47,314
I should just trust that you'll
do the right thing for Willie B.

1422
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:49,590
Is it true you make 10 million a year?

1423
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:50,710
That's right.

1424
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:53,639
It must be true about you
not blocking no more either.

1425
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:59,509
My dad says you won't take passes up
the middle because you might get hurt.

1426
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:01,314
What's that?

1427
01:33:23,240 --> 01:33:26,437
You led, nigger.
But did anybody follow?

1428
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:35,878
Let me tell you something:

1429
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:39,311
For every sucker who makes it...

1430
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:44,678
...for every Barry Sanders,
for every Jerry Rice...

1431
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:47,794
...there's a hundred niggers
you never heard of.

1432
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:52,039
Sure. The game's taught you
how to strut...

1433
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:54,636
...how to talk shit, how to hit.

1434
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,188
But what else?

1435
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:01,630
Suddenly, there's no more money...

1436
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:05,514
...no more women, no more applause.

1437
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:09,234
No more dream.

1438
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:15,070
This is what I'm trying to say to you.

1439
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,079
When a man...

1440
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:23,117
...looks back on his life,
he should be proud of all of it.

1441
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:26,919
Not just the years he spent
in pads and cleats.

1442
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:30,112
Not just memories of...

1443
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:33,799
...when he was great.

1444
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:42,352
You gotta learn that in here.

1445
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:46,394
Or if you don't, you ain't a man,
you're just another punk.

1446
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:04,638
Who wants mustard on their hot dog?
Johnny?

1447
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:06,956
-No, just ketchup.
-Just ketchup.

1448
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:09,515
Ketchup, mustard, mustard...

1449
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:12,109
So doc's cleared you for Sunday?

1450
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:16,995
That's great.

1451
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,469
A little help?

1452
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:27,073
Paper's got us at six-point dogs.
Can you believe that?

1453
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:31,749
I can't wait to strap it on and stick
it to Dallas like we used to.

1454
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:35,555
Show them what this game's all about,
right there in the playoffs.

1455
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:37,949
You okay?

1456
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:41,437
Doc got it wrong about your back?

1457
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:46,470
It hurts a lot more than I thought.
I think I pushed it too hard.

1458
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:48,875
Don't play hurt.
You just need the needle.

1459
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:50,877
Yeah, I'm sure that's it.

1460
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:54,751
Maybe you ought to go with Willie.

1461
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:56,598
Are you seeing your psychiatrist?

1462
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:58,119
No.

1463
01:35:58,320 --> 01:35:59,878
Well, are you depressed?

1464
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:02,512
Rock, come on!

1465
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:06,076
You wanted to play. I fought for you.

1466
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:09,670
If something was wrong, you
should've told me. I had four weeks.

1467
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:11,757
I could've gone another way!

1468
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:13,595
I'm sorry.

1469
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:23,956
I got blank spots in my memory.
It's weird.

1470
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:27,150
And I shake.

1471
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:31,831
Sometimes I can't even hold a spoon.

1472
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:36,994
And I'm always on painkillers
for my elbow...

1473
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:39,754
...or my rib or my neck!

1474
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:42,554
Now I got this ruptured disc,
and I just...

1475
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:48,678
Even with all that,
I would go back in a second...

1476
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:53,672
But if I go in there, Tony...

1477
01:36:56,680 --> 01:36:58,238
...l'm gonna fold.

1478
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:00,759
And I just...

1479
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:06,232
I can't do that.

1480
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:11,995
You know these things you're saying...

1481
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:14,672
...all in your head, Rock.

1482
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:17,119
They're not real.

1483
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:19,359
You understand?

1484
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:21,990
You know you got it in you...

1485
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:24,879
...because I know you do.

1486
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,833
It's my body, Tony.

1487
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:31,439
It's my body. It's not there.

1488
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:33,232
I wouldn't let you get hurt.

1489
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:35,359
I need you, Rock...

1490
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:38,952
...to lead this team.

1491
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:42,674
Come on.

1492
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:44,748
One more time.

1493
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:46,954
You and me.

1494
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:49,910
You and me, together.

1495
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,228
Trust me.

1496
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:01,070
You need me, Tony, I'll be there.

1497
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:02,749
Thank you.

1498
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:07,311
What I'm saying is...

1499
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:11,675
...l've got my rings,
we took care of our money...

1500
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:14,676
...and the kids are all right.

1501
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:19,598
We had a good run.
I just think that it's time for me...

1502
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:22,948
...to get out after this season.

1503
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:24,919
And do what?

1504
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:28,314
I talked to a guy
at one of the networks...

1505
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:30,556
You are a football player.

1506
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:33,677
Will you hear me out?

1507
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:35,598
You're a football player, Jack.

1508
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:39,634
And you have two or three years
left in you.

1509
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:44,469
Cindy, you are missing
the big picture here.

1510
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:47,592
There is no big picture here, Jack!

1511
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:50,633
You're the goddamn quarterback
for the Miami Sharks!

1512
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:53,593
You're a legend,
and you're talking about quitting?

1513
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:58,359
All my life everybody's been telling me
what to do, ever since college!

1514
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:01,074
This is not your decision!
It is my decision...!

1515
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:05,836
I will not listen
to this bullshit from you!

1516
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:07,754
I will not!

1517
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:27,676
Wanna know why?

1518
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:30,474
Because they want you.
You know what I'm saying?

1519
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:32,193
The sky's the limit, baby.

1520
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:34,709
They'll swallow
the beer distributorship.

1521
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:37,639
The funny thing about this
whole situation is...

1522
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:40,115
...no one knows how good
you really are.

1523
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:43,676
You get in that playoff game,
you score...

1524
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:46,674
...you can forget about this team.
They'll lose anyway.

1525
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:48,438
-I'm bored.
-Can you give me a second?

1526
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:51,837
You'll get five million
serious dollars from somebody.

1527
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:54,116
I'm gonna tell you something else.

1528
01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:57,238
Christina wants to give you $2 million
to extend you for the year.

1529
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:59,114
But we're gonna wait.

1530
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:02,950
That's what you hired me for,
to watch your back.

1531
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:04,275
You follow me?

1532
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,357
I hope you're doing that, Wayne.

1533
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:09,515
Just in case I ain't made out of steel.

1534
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:12,270
I'm saying, what if
my arm starts hurting?

1535
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:14,072
Where you coming from with that?

1536
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:17,079
Baby, ain't nothing
gonna fall apart on you.

1537
01:40:17,640 --> 01:40:18,436
Vanessa!

1538
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:20,435
"Vanessa"?

1539
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:23,119
Excuse me.

1540
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:24,873
Hey, that's Willie Beamen!

1541
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:32,238
How you been? Long time.

1542
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:34,359
Congratulations.

1543
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:38,070
-Things are cool.
-Getting what you wanted?

1544
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:39,913
I blew it, V.

1545
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:43,915
Everything was just happening so fast,
I didn't have time to think.

1546
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:48,075
I was thinking maybe we could go out,
we could just get together.

1547
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:51,915
I don't think so, Willie. I'm sorry.

1548
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:55,158
I understand. Or do I?

1549
01:40:55,640 --> 01:40:57,232
You're just too volatile for me.

1550
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:59,630
I'm a simple girl.
I like simple things.

1551
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:03,469
Truth be told, I didn't even
like football. I liked you.

1552
01:41:03,680 --> 01:41:04,908
I'm sorry.

1553
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:07,193
-I understand...
-Willie, no!

1554
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:21,633
-Get out of here!
-I need to talk to you.

1555
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:23,478
Oh, my goodness, Barbara Bush.

1556
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:26,354
-Where you been all my life?
-I'm sorry.

1557
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,797
You're looking good too!

1558
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,150
There's that smile
I've been looking for.

1559
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:35,109
Listen to me. I just need to know
that I can call you.

1560
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:39,670
Tell me that I can call you,
or I'll never talk to you again.

1561
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:41,791
You're so full of shit.

1562
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,309
No, I'm not. I'm very serious.

1563
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:45,868
Don't test me.

1564
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:50,511
You can call me as long as
you get out of here! Now go!

1565
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:51,914
Get out of here!

1566
01:41:52,120 --> 01:41:54,190
-You too shy?
-No, I'm not shy!

1567
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:55,873
I got a date out there.

1568
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:58,674
You're talking about
the mortician out there?

1569
01:41:59,160 --> 01:42:01,469
You're just jealous because he's tall.

1570
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:03,799
But he can't ball.

1571
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:06,798
I'll holler.

1572
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:11,710
Congratulations.

1573
01:42:12,440 --> 01:42:13,839
Was I the last to know?

1574
01:42:14,040 --> 01:42:15,632
Cindy Rooney told me.

1575
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,309
What the hell are you doing
starting Cap?

1576
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:21,318
Throwing him against the best
pass rush in the league?

1577
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:22,509
Cap's my starter.

1578
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,915
-lf we lose this game...
-I'll do you one better.

1579
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:27,076
In the off-season, I'm trading Willie.

1580
01:42:27,320 --> 01:42:28,753
That's not your option.

1581
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:33,476
Your kid may sell a lot of T-shirts,
but he is tearing this team apart!

1582
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:35,796
-Then hold it together!
-I can't! Not with him.

1583
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:36,876
Where are you going?

1584
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:39,640
You will start Willie on Sunday...

1585
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:42,149
...and you'll make the adjustment
to modern times.

1586
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:43,958
You don't tell me what to do.

1587
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:45,679
Nobody tells me what to do!

1588
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:49,475
Your father never told me what to do!
You're not gonna start!

1589
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:52,797
I'd cut my father's ass
if we were losing like this.

1590
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:56,595
You know, I'm really getting
sick and tired of you.

1591
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:58,990
Your father was no genius.

1592
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:01,351
He only acted like he was one.

1593
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:04,717
And he took credit for a lot of things
he never did!

1594
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:06,990
He at least respected me.

1595
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:10,192
Would you stop using my father
as a scapegoat?

1596
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:14,830
I can't even imagine what he'd think
of you right now...

1597
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:18,715
...but my hunch is, he'd be ashamed.
He'd be ashamed!

1598
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:22,629
Why do you think he put me in charge,
you bullheaded moron?

1599
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:26,037
He could've made you general manager,
but he didn't, did he?

1600
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:27,719
You know why?

1601
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:31,799
Because he knew you didn't have the guts
to do it after he was gone!

1602
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:43,398
It's true, Tony.
He couldn't trust you.

1603
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:45,513
You got old.

1604
01:44:17,080 --> 01:44:19,150
I'll be in my father's office.

1605
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:29,516
-Christina will destroy this team.
-What is it you fear?

1606
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:33,837
You've got so much fear
inside of you, Tony.

1607
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:38,110
I'm losing the team, Maggie.

1608
01:44:38,840 --> 01:44:40,717
I'm losing control.

1609
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:44,831
Everything in my life's about control.

1610
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:46,189
I lead men.

1611
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,518
I control.

1612
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:53,351
Did Art think I was past it?

1613
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:56,114
I don't know.

1614
01:44:57,840 --> 01:44:59,159
Do you care?

1615
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:02,238
You never understood Artie,
did you?

1616
01:45:03,120 --> 01:45:05,429
He wanted a son...

1617
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:08,114
...more than anything else
in the world.

1618
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:13,558
And when you really think about it,
what Christina is...

1619
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:15,956
...it's just such a tragedy.

1620
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,912
You know, she will sell the team.

1621
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:24,154
And everything her father
stood for is gonna die.

1622
01:45:26,840 --> 01:45:30,799
And what will you do, Tony,
after football...

1623
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:34,154
...with nobody to control?

1624
01:45:34,840 --> 01:45:36,717
Stop it. What are you doing?

1625
01:45:37,480 --> 01:45:40,233
Hey, I blame you for a lot of things.

1626
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:44,639
You were like Artie.

1627
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:47,078
A monster.

1628
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:51,238
You've gotten older. Better.

1629
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:57,079
But for a long time I hated you.

1630
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:02,876
That game took my husband,
my daughter...

1631
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:04,672
...my youth.

1632
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:06,194
Left me with what?

1633
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:10,515
All those Sunday afternoons
at the stadium.

1634
01:46:11,680 --> 01:46:13,432
And time...

1635
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,639
...just kept slipping away, didn't it?

1636
01:46:27,400 --> 01:46:28,719
How's your head, Jack?

1637
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:33,311
Sandy, it's nice of you to ask.
It's still hurting, quite frankly.

1638
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:35,516
Like you guys, I play hurt.

1639
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:38,872
Look at the monitor, you'll see
it was more than aggression.

1640
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:41,150
Out of my way!

1641
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:43,797
Well, that's just great.

1642
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:07,678
There goes D'Amato, his 14th
consecutive game with a touchdown!

1643
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:12,591
We regret to inform you that your
husband, Lieutenant Louis D'Amato...

1644
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:15,519
... was killed in the European
theater of operations.

1645
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:18,439
And to your son, Anthony D'Amato...

1646
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:20,991
...our deepest regrets.

1647
01:48:14,240 --> 01:48:17,596
Controversy swirls around
the six-point Shark underdogs.

1648
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:22,237
Willie "Steamin"' Beamen,
the sensational quarterback...

1649
01:48:22,520 --> 01:48:25,353
... who's held the Sharks together,
is not starting.

1650
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:28,711
He's said to be feuding
with his beleaguered coach...

1651
01:48:28,920 --> 01:48:32,117
... who's being investigated
for hitting Jack Rose...

1652
01:48:32,320 --> 01:48:34,231
...earlier this week at practice.

1653
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:39,476
I'd say that's
a bit of an exaggeration.

1654
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:41,398
-A mild shove.
-We'll find out later.

1655
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:44,239
I'm the best yard receiver
that's ever lived.

1656
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:46,436
I can catch anything.

1657
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:50,036
I'm the best receiver
that's ever lived.

1658
01:48:51,160 --> 01:48:52,354
That's right.

1659
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:55,552
Meanwhile, Tug,
immortal but vulnerable Cap Rooney...

1660
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:58,638
...only six weeks off
a microdiskectomy...

1661
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:03,592
...will start against
the league's toughest pass rush.

1662
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:05,313
-"Toughest"?
-The toughest.

1663
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:08,830
Get ready for the sparks to fly.
We'll be right back.

1664
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,275
"The tension of the season
got to me...

1665
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:18,029
...and I overreacted to an innocent
question from a journalist...

1666
01:49:18,280 --> 01:49:20,271
...we all know to be
of the highest caliber.

1667
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:24,598
I only hope that one day I'll truly
be able to show Jack Rose...

1668
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:27,792
...just how much I treasure
his invaluable contribution...

1669
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:29,797
...to the sport of football."

1670
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:32,788
Thank you.

1671
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:36,953
Where's your wheelchair?

1672
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:39,033
Hello, commissioner.

1673
01:49:41,680 --> 01:49:43,238
God, I hate Texas.

1674
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:49,272
How are the headaches?

1675
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:51,516
Fine, till you start doing that shit.

1676
01:49:52,440 --> 01:49:53,555
Your balance?

1677
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:55,432
My check balance?

1678
01:49:55,640 --> 01:49:58,154
Looking P-H-A-T, baby. Phat.

1679
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:00,751
Go on, get out of here.
You're done.

1680
01:50:02,120 --> 01:50:03,758
How about another shot, doc?

1681
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:07,077
You don't need it.
It doesn't make any sense...

1682
01:50:07,480 --> 01:50:08,356
...medically.

1683
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:12,951
Don't give a shit about medical, doc.
Give me some of that cortisone shit.

1684
01:50:13,880 --> 01:50:15,074
Please?

1685
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:34,473
The surviving team will move on
next week to Minnesota...

1686
01:50:34,680 --> 01:50:37,831
...cold country for the
AFFA conference championship.

1687
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:41,470
In the meantime,
we're back to another dang commercial.

1688
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,309
I don't know what to say, really.

1689
01:50:50,680 --> 01:50:51,715
Three minutes...

1690
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:55,759
...till the biggest battle
of our professional lives.

1691
01:50:56,920 --> 01:50:58,512
All comes down to today.

1692
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:04,318
Either we heal as a team...

1693
01:51:05,640 --> 01:51:07,153
...or we're gonna crumble.

1694
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:12,478
Inch by inch, play by play,
till we're finished.

1695
01:51:12,680 --> 01:51:14,989
We're in hell right now, gentlemen.

1696
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:16,515
Believe me.

1697
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:22,150
And we can stay here,
get the shit kicked out of us...

1698
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:27,669
...or we can fight our way
back into the light.

1699
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:30,390
We can climb out of hell...

1700
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:33,995
...one inch at a time.

1701
01:51:36,240 --> 01:51:38,708
Now, I can't do it for you.

1702
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:40,114
I'm too old.

1703
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:46,359
I look around, I see these
young faces, and I think...

1704
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:52,115
...I made every wrong choice
a middle-aged man can make.

1705
01:51:55,720 --> 01:51:58,996
I pissed away all my money,
believe it or not.

1706
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:03,591
I chased off anyone
who's ever loved me.

1707
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:10,116
And lately, I can't even stand
the face I see in the mirror.

1708
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:18,639
You know, when you get old in life,
things get taken from you.

1709
01:52:18,840 --> 01:52:20,831
I mean, that's part of life.

1710
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:25,076
But you only learn that
when you start losing stuff.

1711
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:29,473
You find out life's this game
of inches.

1712
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:32,039
So is football.

1713
01:52:32,920 --> 01:52:36,356
Because in either game,
life or football...

1714
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:39,438
...the margin for error is so small...

1715
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:44,473
...one-half a step too late or early,
and you don't quite make it.

1716
01:52:44,680 --> 01:52:48,309
One half-second too slow, too fast,
you don't quite catch it.

1717
01:52:48,520 --> 01:52:52,752
The inches we need are
everywhere around us.

1718
01:52:53,240 --> 01:52:57,950
They're in every break of the game,
every minute, every second.

1719
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:03,517
On this team, we fight for that inch.

1720
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:06,431
On this team, we tear ourselves...

1721
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:11,077
...and everyone else around us,
to pieces for that inch.

1722
01:53:11,480 --> 01:53:14,472
We claw with our fingernails
for that inch...

1723
01:53:15,960 --> 01:53:18,918
...because we know when we add up
all those inches...

1724
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:24,670
...that's gonna make the fucking
difference between winning and losing!

1725
01:53:26,120 --> 01:53:28,554
Between living and dying!

1726
01:53:30,360 --> 01:53:32,430
I'll tell you this. In any fight...

1727
01:53:32,920 --> 01:53:37,516
...it's the guy who's willing to die
who's gonna win that inch.

1728
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:40,713
And I know if I'm gonna have
any life anymore...

1729
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:44,709
...it's because I'm still willing
to fight and die for that inch.

1730
01:53:46,720 --> 01:53:49,553
Because that's what living is!

1731
01:53:50,040 --> 01:53:51,871
The six inches in front of your face!

1732
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:55,235
Now, I can't make you do it!

1733
01:53:55,680 --> 01:53:57,591
You gotta look at the guy
next to you!

1734
01:53:57,800 --> 01:53:59,597
Look into his eyes!

1735
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:03,395
I think you're gonna see a guy
who'll go that inch with you!

1736
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:05,678
You're gonna see a guy...

1737
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:08,917
...who will sacrifice himself
for this team...

1738
01:54:09,160 --> 01:54:11,993
...because he knows,
when it comes down to it...

1739
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:14,395
...you're gonna do the same for him!

1740
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:17,351
That's a team, gentlemen!

1741
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:22,675
And either we heal now, as a team...

1742
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:27,676
...or we will die as individuals.

1743
01:54:31,160 --> 01:54:32,798
That's football, guys.

1744
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:37,633
That's all it is.

1745
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:40,195
Now...

1746
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:43,712
...what are you gonna do?

1747
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:48,111
Here we go, ladies and gentlemen.

1748
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:01,231
He's in the open field.

1749
01:56:01,600 --> 01:56:03,431
He's gonna go all the way!

1750
01:56:03,640 --> 01:56:05,437
To the thirty. All the way!

1751
01:56:05,720 --> 01:56:06,869
Touchdown!

1752
01:56:09,160 --> 01:56:11,355
-Way to go!
-No big deal.

1753
01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:14,839
We still block and tackle.

1754
01:56:15,080 --> 01:56:18,390
We didn't say we'd win by a shutout.
Nothing changes, right?

1755
01:56:18,600 --> 01:56:20,192
Stay with the game plan.

1756
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,434
-Set for the first series?
-Piece of cake.

1757
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:25,232
Bring it home, Rock.

1758
01:56:28,120 --> 01:56:32,716
How about a big Texas-size welcome
for the Miami Sharks...

1759
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:35,309
...and quarterback Jack Rooney!

1760
01:56:41,080 --> 01:56:42,035
My baby!

1761
01:56:42,680 --> 01:56:45,513
Guys, I missed your ugly mugs.

1762
01:56:47,680 --> 01:56:49,830
Just like old times.
Your disk still spinning?

1763
01:56:50,040 --> 01:56:52,315
Like your favorite CD, baby.

1764
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:54,033
Listen up.

1765
01:57:36,480 --> 01:57:38,232
It's a 12-point game for Dallas.

1766
01:57:38,440 --> 01:57:40,032
What? It's just one touchdown.

1767
01:57:52,640 --> 01:57:54,119
In your hometown.

1768
01:57:54,360 --> 01:57:56,316
A long way to go,
a lot of time to play.

1769
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:09,317
There he goes. Sack number 12.

1770
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:12,512
That's a personal high
for Luther Lavay.

1771
01:58:23,480 --> 01:58:26,278
Man, I can't believe this.
It stinks.

1772
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:29,711
We're the better team. We'll win
if we don't make any mistakes.

1773
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:04,911
Inches, inches.

1774
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:10,118
Let me on the finance committee. I'll
make a difference with the networks.

1775
01:59:10,360 --> 01:59:13,397
I know New York.
I can be incredibly effective.

1776
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:15,955
Your mother looks great, by the way.

1777
01:59:16,160 --> 01:59:18,993
-She loves Dallas. Neiman Marcus.
-She's a good woman.

1778
01:59:19,960 --> 01:59:21,678
And your golf?

1779
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:25,517
I'm about an 11 from the whites.

1780
01:59:25,720 --> 01:59:29,599
-Think you're ready for me?
-Don't think I'm in your class.

1781
01:59:43,320 --> 01:59:44,594
First down, Dallas!

1782
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:46,879
It's a good game.

1783
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:52,949
Good team.

1784
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:54,829
Thank you.

1785
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:01,709
I don't wanna bother you about this...

1786
02:00:03,360 --> 02:00:06,591
The owners would like you to
come to New York for a meeting.

1787
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:07,955
About what?

1788
02:00:08,720 --> 02:00:11,154
There's a concern
that's been voiced...

1789
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:13,834
...about some moves made
on your behalf...

1790
02:00:14,040 --> 02:00:17,316
...for another Los Angeles franchise.

1791
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:21,513
-Rules have been broken. We've heard...
-Who said this?

1792
02:00:22,720 --> 02:00:25,951
Would Wednesday this week be too soon?

1793
02:00:27,160 --> 02:00:29,310
No. That'd be fine.

1794
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:32,350
Good.

1795
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:35,677
The best of luck to you today, then.

1796
02:00:36,920 --> 02:00:40,754
I honestly believe that woman
would eat her young.

1797
02:00:41,680 --> 02:00:43,272
What the fuck just happened?

1798
02:01:40,600 --> 02:01:42,192
That's the meaning
in one sentence...

1799
02:01:42,440 --> 02:01:43,668
...of captain Jack Rooney.

1800
02:01:43,920 --> 02:01:45,114
He won't take no for an answer.

1801
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:48,719
Good job, Cap!

1802
02:01:50,640 --> 02:01:51,868
Good job, baby!

1803
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:54,512
They can't fuck with you!

1804
02:02:18,480 --> 02:02:21,711
Score at halftime:
Knights 21, Sharks 17.

1805
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:25,554
-I'm going down.
-ls that a good idea?

1806
02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:31,632
-Can you play?
-I'm banged up, but I'm all right.

1807
02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:33,433
Can you play?

1808
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:35,114
Yeah, you bet.

1809
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:36,588
Look at me, Rock.

1810
02:02:38,640 --> 02:02:40,870
You were a warrior out there today.

1811
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:43,717
I will never forget this.

1812
02:02:49,560 --> 02:02:51,516
Go do your job, coach.

1813
02:03:07,480 --> 02:03:09,675
This isn't about you and me anymore.

1814
02:03:12,480 --> 02:03:14,391
You gotta lead this team.

1815
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:17,158
When they look in your eyes...

1816
02:03:17,400 --> 02:03:18,992
...they gotta believe.

1817
02:03:20,440 --> 02:03:21,429
I know.

1818
02:03:31,720 --> 02:03:35,190
What do you think you're doing?
Cap is finished.

1819
02:03:46,520 --> 02:03:49,751
Never talk that way
in front of my players!

1820
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:51,069
Get out of here!

1821
02:03:51,320 --> 02:03:54,551
I don't give a shit if Willie
is out there changing the plays!

1822
02:03:54,760 --> 02:03:57,194
You let your ego get in the way
of this team...

1823
02:03:57,400 --> 02:03:59,311
...and you'll lose
this fucking game!

1824
02:03:59,520 --> 02:04:01,238
Get out of here!!

1825
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,878
I'm sorry, but Coach D.
already told me I was going in.

1826
02:04:15,120 --> 02:04:17,839
Control the line of scrimmage,
you'll control this game.

1827
02:04:18,160 --> 02:04:21,311
Possession of the ball,
that's all I want. Move those chains.

1828
02:04:21,640 --> 02:04:25,792
Read the safety's drop.
If he backpedals, then we go downtown.

1829
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:27,797
Surprise them. Make it sudden.

1830
02:04:28,080 --> 02:04:31,675
If you see their arms shaking,
that means they're coming.

1831
02:04:31,880 --> 02:04:34,075
Control the line of scrimmage,
you control the game.

1832
02:04:34,320 --> 02:04:35,435
You said that already.

1833
02:04:35,640 --> 02:04:40,077
One more thing. Right out of the gate,
let it fly, go 999.

1834
02:04:40,920 --> 02:04:42,558
Shock the shit out of them!

1835
02:04:48,440 --> 02:04:49,316
Interception!

1836
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:51,670
What a way to start
this second half!

1837
02:04:52,520 --> 02:04:54,397
He's down at the 48-yard line.

1838
02:04:54,600 --> 02:04:58,388
That's a tough break for this kid,
his first time in the playoffs.

1839
02:04:58,600 --> 02:05:00,158
He's gotta be feeling the pressure.

1840
02:05:00,400 --> 02:05:02,118
Branco's just aching to nail you.

1841
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,912
Watch his knuckles.
If they go white, do a fade to Sandman.

1842
02:05:06,120 --> 02:05:07,599
You want me to check off?

1843
02:05:07,880 --> 02:05:09,438
Where's the coach I knew and loved?

1844
02:05:09,640 --> 02:05:10,868
If Branco bites.

1845
02:05:26,040 --> 02:05:27,234
First down.

1846
02:05:54,840 --> 02:05:57,035
Looks like he had damage to his eye.

1847
02:05:57,680 --> 02:05:58,669
On the four!

1848
02:05:58,880 --> 02:06:00,472
Twist it! Twist it!

1849
02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:07,517
Here we go.
Strong Left Zig 90 Gun on three.

1850
02:06:07,720 --> 02:06:09,312
I'm serious. It's Coach D.'s call.

1851
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:11,870
By the way...

1852
02:06:12,080 --> 02:06:14,514
...l'm sorry about getting a big head.
It wasn't me.

1853
02:06:15,640 --> 02:06:17,835
It was the devil. Red 666.

1854
02:06:22,040 --> 02:06:23,951
Let's get them
before they know what hit them.

1855
02:06:24,160 --> 02:06:25,195
On three. Ready?

1856
02:06:25,720 --> 02:06:27,472
Watch the robber on your right.

1857
02:06:27,680 --> 02:06:28,749
He'll be coming at you.

1858
02:06:47,400 --> 02:06:49,197
Touchdown, Miami.

1859
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:52,439
I'm good!

1860
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:56,598
This one right there.

1861
02:07:05,200 --> 02:07:06,519
Touchdown!

1862
02:07:09,560 --> 02:07:13,348
If you hit him for another score
in the next series, he'll fold.

1863
02:07:13,560 --> 02:07:14,788
I know it.

1864
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:24,672
Touchdown, Miami.

1865
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:28,632
That's what I'm talking about, baby!

1866
02:07:33,040 --> 02:07:34,871
Depending on how the election goes...

1867
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:37,799
We got six producing wells probably
pumping out about...

1868
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:40,479
Your home base is in Dallas?

1869
02:07:43,960 --> 02:07:45,393
The thing that bothers me most...

1870
02:07:45,600 --> 02:07:48,672
...is if you don't have 30,000
in attendance...

1871
02:08:11,680 --> 02:08:14,194
Coach, it's fourth and one,
we need a time-out.

1872
02:08:14,440 --> 02:08:17,034
All right. Shark! Let's go.
Run the Three-man.

1873
02:08:19,040 --> 02:08:20,712
Looks like Dallas is going for it.

1874
02:08:20,920 --> 02:08:23,036
He is going for the victory now,
not a tie.

1875
02:08:23,240 --> 02:08:24,559
Here we go now. One time.

1876
02:08:24,760 --> 02:08:27,433
This is the game, Tug.
If Miami can hold them here...

1877
02:08:27,640 --> 02:08:29,995
... Willie Beamen will have
one last chance.

1878
02:08:30,200 --> 02:08:32,395
This is where the famous rubber...

1879
02:08:32,600 --> 02:08:33,794
...meets the famous road.

1880
02:08:34,600 --> 02:08:35,953
Settle down! Be proud!

1881
02:08:36,160 --> 02:08:37,718
Guys, y'all gonna make this play.

1882
02:08:37,920 --> 02:08:39,478
One yard stands between us
and Minnesota!

1883
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:40,635
They got no respect for us.

1884
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:41,829
Shark flat on his ass!

1885
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:44,634
Everything we ever fought for
is on the line right now.

1886
02:08:44,840 --> 02:08:45,989
Be proud!

1887
02:08:50,200 --> 02:08:51,838
Strong right! Strong right!

1888
02:09:21,680 --> 02:09:23,432
Is it first?

1889
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:33,878
Sharks' ball! First down!

1890
02:09:43,640 --> 02:09:45,949
Looks like a man's down
at the line of scrimmage.

1891
02:09:46,160 --> 02:09:47,798
Luther "Shark" Lavay.

1892
02:09:48,680 --> 02:09:51,478
He's been the heart
and soul of this defense.

1893
02:09:51,680 --> 02:09:53,079
Let's hope he's okay.

1894
02:09:58,240 --> 02:09:59,389
Stabilize his head.

1895
02:10:03,560 --> 02:10:05,471
Can you hear me?! Check his hands.

1896
02:10:05,800 --> 02:10:06,835
We got a pulse.

1897
02:10:08,840 --> 02:10:10,159
I don't know, coach.

1898
02:10:12,320 --> 02:10:14,550
What does that mean?
Is he breathing?

1899
02:10:15,080 --> 02:10:16,115
Ambulance!

1900
02:10:16,320 --> 02:10:18,550
Talk to me, Shark. Come on.

1901
02:10:21,480 --> 02:10:22,754
Let's get that board over here!

1902
02:10:26,520 --> 02:10:28,033
Is this how it starts?

1903
02:10:47,240 --> 02:10:48,036
Coach.

1904
02:10:50,160 --> 02:10:51,149
Did I stop him?

1905
02:10:51,560 --> 02:10:54,199
You stopped him cold, goddamn it!
Look at that!

1906
02:10:55,600 --> 02:10:57,795
Major bonus, baby. One million bucks!

1907
02:11:02,040 --> 02:11:03,359
One, two, three, roll.

1908
02:11:11,440 --> 02:11:13,431
Don't you guys drop me.

1909
02:11:13,760 --> 02:11:16,035
I'm worth a million dollars.

1910
02:11:29,240 --> 02:11:31,754
Well, 55 seconds.
You think they can pull it off?

1911
02:11:31,960 --> 02:11:35,794
Look at that. Oh, boy!
Is Dallas in trouble now!

1912
02:11:36,640 --> 02:11:37,755
Willie Beamen's ritual.

1913
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:40,433
Let's put Sanderson to work.

1914
02:11:40,640 --> 02:11:43,108
55 seconds. Do or die.
We throw on two.

1915
02:11:43,360 --> 02:11:44,349
Ready. Break!

1916
02:11:46,040 --> 02:11:48,076
It's beautiful to watch you throw.

1917
02:11:48,320 --> 02:11:50,629
It's beautiful to hear you say that,
not-so-old man.

1918
02:11:54,640 --> 02:11:56,756
Razor! Check it. Razor!

1919
02:12:06,200 --> 02:12:07,076
Do it.

1920
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:09,356
Do it! Come on!

1921
02:12:13,720 --> 02:12:14,948
Be there!

1922
02:12:39,640 --> 02:12:42,074
Flag! On the play.
It's coming back.

1923
02:12:42,360 --> 02:12:43,759
Holding, 69.

1924
02:12:44,880 --> 02:12:47,235
No touchdown! Holding!

1925
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:56,589
You're out!

1926
02:12:56,800 --> 02:12:58,233
Touched an official!

1927
02:13:00,440 --> 02:13:01,759
Not anymore! Get off!

1928
02:13:05,200 --> 02:13:06,474
Thank you.

1929
02:13:09,720 --> 02:13:12,314
-That might be the backbreaker.
-Damn it!

1930
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:15,431
-We got them where we want them.
-Punk!

1931
02:13:15,640 --> 02:13:16,755
I'll take it in myself.

1932
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:18,149
I liked you when you was puking!

1933
02:13:18,400 --> 02:13:20,470
-Who are we?
-Sharks!

1934
02:13:21,480 --> 02:13:23,835
I feel like things are changing,
you know?

1935
02:13:30,880 --> 02:13:32,757
Things are out of control.

1936
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:36,115
Maybe I'm just out of control.

1937
02:13:39,400 --> 02:13:41,755
Sorry for the way I've been behaving.

1938
02:13:42,920 --> 02:13:44,353
It's all right.

1939
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:52,199
Keep your wits about you.

1940
02:13:54,600 --> 02:13:55,715
Roll it! Roll it!

1941
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:21,995
Time-out.

1942
02:14:24,160 --> 02:14:25,593
Time-out, Miami!

1943
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:28,189
That's the last one.
Something's gotta be wrong.

1944
02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:30,960
-They had it cold.
-Smart move.

1945
02:14:31,160 --> 02:14:33,833
There's something I've been
really dying to ask you.

1946
02:14:34,040 --> 02:14:37,828
Remember when you came to my place?
I made dinner for you?

1947
02:14:39,520 --> 02:14:41,033
Did you not like the jambalaya?

1948
02:14:43,520 --> 02:14:47,115
Worst shit I ever tasted.
Why do you think I've been throwing up?

1949
02:14:47,560 --> 02:14:48,675
I thought that.

1950
02:14:48,920 --> 02:14:51,912
-No, you know that.
-Now go win this game!

1951
02:15:05,600 --> 02:15:06,953
Comanche.

1952
02:15:07,800 --> 02:15:09,313
Tony, we got nine seconds!

1953
02:15:09,520 --> 02:15:11,750
If he's stopped inbounds,
the game's over.

1954
02:15:11,960 --> 02:15:13,598
This is what coaching's all about.

1955
02:15:16,440 --> 02:15:17,714
Hey, Nick, you up for it?

1956
02:15:18,040 --> 02:15:19,189
Spread West Hustle...

1957
02:15:19,440 --> 02:15:20,634
West Hustle 60...

1958
02:15:20,840 --> 02:15:22,159
Sixty Comanche?

1959
02:15:22,400 --> 02:15:23,469
Man has balls of iron.

1960
02:15:24,200 --> 02:15:26,111
-We in this together?
-Dynamic duo, baby!

1961
02:15:58,440 --> 02:15:59,668
Don't let him out-of-bounds!

1962
02:16:01,240 --> 02:16:02,389
Out!

1963
02:16:09,880 --> 02:16:11,199
Out-of-bounds on the 3!

1964
02:16:11,400 --> 02:16:14,312
Unselfish! Unselfish!
Way to go, Julian!

1965
02:16:24,120 --> 02:16:26,156
You hear that? That's four seconds.

1966
02:16:31,880 --> 02:16:33,791
Time-out called by the Knights.

1967
02:16:34,400 --> 02:16:36,470
Dallas 35, Miami 31.

1968
02:16:36,720 --> 02:16:39,234
Now, remember,
see it before you do it.

1969
02:16:39,840 --> 02:16:41,319
Julian gave you the shot.

1970
02:16:41,520 --> 02:16:43,238
Make them believe, Willie.

1971
02:16:43,440 --> 02:16:45,317
This time, now.

1972
02:16:47,360 --> 02:16:49,476
One on one, man on man.

1973
02:16:49,680 --> 02:16:51,591
We do it together, all right?

1974
02:16:51,800 --> 02:16:53,438
I know y'all don't wanna go home.

1975
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:54,795
It ain't no tomorrow!

1976
02:17:06,600 --> 02:17:09,353
Three yards to go. Four seconds.
One play.

1977
02:17:10,040 --> 02:17:11,792
We've been in too many of these.

1978
02:17:12,400 --> 02:17:13,389
This one'll get it.

1979
02:17:13,600 --> 02:17:14,828
Four seconds.

1980
02:17:15,880 --> 02:17:17,950
Four seconds is a lifetime!

1981
02:17:18,200 --> 02:17:20,156
We're a lifetime away here!

1982
02:17:25,720 --> 02:17:27,153
Rifle 22!

1983
02:18:17,320 --> 02:18:19,072
I think he lost it!
It didn't go!

1984
02:18:29,800 --> 02:18:31,552
Watch out! Watch out!

1985
02:18:31,920 --> 02:18:32,750
Touchdown!

1986
02:18:37,480 --> 02:18:39,436
Touchdown! Touchdown!

1987
02:19:46,600 --> 02:19:47,669
Nice night.

1988
02:19:49,600 --> 02:19:51,158
Can't get over Cap.

1989
02:19:52,840 --> 02:19:56,549
I learned more watching him in the
first half than I did in five seasons.

1990
02:19:57,480 --> 02:19:59,471
Next week I'll win it
just for him.

1991
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:05,596
Glad to see success hasn't
gone to your head too much, kid.

1992
02:20:05,800 --> 02:20:08,075
Who, me? Steamin' Beamen?

1993
02:20:10,640 --> 02:20:12,198
This is your moment, Willie.

1994
02:20:13,160 --> 02:20:14,388
Savor it.

1995
02:20:15,840 --> 02:20:20,516
But never forget. On any given Sunday,
you're either gonna win or lose.

1996
02:20:21,080 --> 02:20:24,390
"But can you win or lose like a man?"
I got it, coach.

1997
02:20:34,760 --> 02:20:36,193
Next year...

1998
02:20:36,760 --> 02:20:38,318
...l'm out of here.

1999
02:20:41,640 --> 02:20:42,834
I figured.

2000
02:20:46,040 --> 02:20:48,679
I'm not the right guy
for this team anymore.

2001
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:50,513
I wouldn't say all that.

2002
02:20:51,240 --> 02:20:54,789
There was this great quarterback
in the '70s I knew.

2003
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:58,515
I mean, this guy was one tough
son of a bitch.

2004
02:20:58,720 --> 02:21:01,393
He fought for every inch he ever got.

2005
02:21:01,720 --> 02:21:05,679
He didn't have your natural skills,
but he could make it happen.

2006
02:21:05,880 --> 02:21:08,872
He could win.
But the game passed him by.

2007
02:21:09,400 --> 02:21:11,630
Anyway, I ran into this guy...

2008
02:21:12,600 --> 02:21:14,511
...a few weeks ago in L.A.

2009
02:21:14,720 --> 02:21:18,679
We had a few beers, and we start
talking. You know what he told me?

2010
02:21:19,960 --> 02:21:21,552
He said when he looked back...

2011
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:24,911
...he didn't really miss
the Pantheon Cups...

2012
02:21:25,360 --> 02:21:26,713
...or the girls...

2013
02:21:27,120 --> 02:21:28,348
...or even the glory.

2014
02:21:28,600 --> 02:21:30,033
You know what he missed?

2015
02:21:31,240 --> 02:21:35,711
What he missed were those other guys
looking back at him in the huddle.

2016
02:21:36,920 --> 02:21:38,194
Those eleven guys...

2017
02:21:39,440 --> 02:21:42,238
...every one of them seeing things
the same way.

2018
02:21:42,640 --> 02:21:44,915
All of them looking downfield...

2019
02:21:45,360 --> 02:21:46,554
...together.

2020
02:21:47,720 --> 02:21:49,233
That's what he missed.

2021
02:21:52,320 --> 02:21:54,038
I'm gonna miss you, amigo.

2022
02:22:09,680 --> 02:22:13,753
You know, my arm has been killing me.
I met with a specialist who said...

2023
02:22:20,520 --> 02:22:21,953
I'm scared.

2024
02:22:29,440 --> 02:22:30,429
We're all scared.

2025
02:22:30,640 --> 02:22:34,599
If you think it's easy being a coach,
I'll trade your microphone for my ulcer.

2026
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:36,995
I'm a triple-decker
stress sandwich right now.

2027
02:22:37,240 --> 02:22:40,915
Why is that, coach?
The 32-13 loss to San Francisco?

2028
02:22:41,160 --> 02:22:44,709
You're not even close, Johnny.
Try fishing someplace else.

2029
02:22:44,920 --> 02:22:48,356
And I want to live up to what it is
my father left me.

2030
02:22:48,800 --> 02:22:50,199
A legacy.

2031
02:22:50,480 --> 02:22:53,074
A feeling of a bond with this town.

2032
02:22:53,320 --> 02:22:55,515
A feeling that this is our house.

2033
02:22:55,720 --> 02:22:57,790
The Pagniacci house.

2034
02:23:03,080 --> 02:23:05,355
And we have great confidence...

2035
02:23:05,560 --> 02:23:09,189
...that in the final hour,
our mayor will be there for us.

2036
02:23:23,160 --> 02:23:24,434
And Tony...

2037
02:23:25,240 --> 02:23:26,229
Know this.

2038
02:23:26,480 --> 02:23:28,835
Wherever you go, you will always be...

2039
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,753
...loved and greatly respected.

2040
02:23:34,680 --> 02:23:35,635
Thank you.

2041
02:23:37,360 --> 02:23:40,591
Thanks for helping me understand again
what I had forgotten.

2042
02:23:43,840 --> 02:23:45,353
Tony D.!

2043
02:24:03,880 --> 02:24:05,233
He's been here 30 years!

2044
02:24:05,640 --> 02:24:07,915
Even the dogs are sad, he said.

2045
02:24:11,400 --> 02:24:14,995
It's been way too long
not to win a big one.

2046
02:24:16,480 --> 02:24:19,631
San Francisco sure
took care of that for us.

2047
02:24:26,480 --> 02:24:30,029
In football, as in life, things change.

2048
02:24:32,920 --> 02:24:37,436
I guess it's time for me to get the
hell out of the way, bring in the new.

2049
02:24:38,120 --> 02:24:41,351
I like Nick Crozier.
I think he'll do a great job.

2050
02:24:46,040 --> 02:24:49,794
But most of all I want to thank
the people of Miami...

2051
02:24:51,760 --> 02:24:56,117
...for their support through
the last 20-some odd years.

2052
02:24:56,640 --> 02:24:58,153
Gee, it just flew by.

2053
02:25:02,240 --> 02:25:04,231
It's really meant a lot to me.

2054
02:25:08,160 --> 02:25:09,878
It meant everything to me.

2055
02:25:11,240 --> 02:25:14,596
I've had a great, great ride,
believe me. And...

2056
02:25:14,800 --> 02:25:16,233
And I'm gonna miss you.

2057
02:25:17,360 --> 02:25:20,113
He's an arrogant son of a bitch,
but I'll miss him.

2058
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,070
In thinking about change...

2059
02:25:25,880 --> 02:25:30,396
...I don't know, I felt maybe it was
time for me to make a change too.

2060
02:25:30,840 --> 02:25:35,516
And it was Willie Beamen taught me
how to give it another shot.

2061
02:25:38,520 --> 02:25:40,112
So starting today...

2062
02:25:40,920 --> 02:25:42,592
...l'm taking over as head coach...

2063
02:25:42,840 --> 02:25:46,879
...for that new expansion team in
Albuquerque, New Mexico, the Aztecs.

2064
02:25:48,080 --> 02:25:52,232
"Why, " do you say? Because they're
giving me full management control.

2065
02:25:53,840 --> 02:25:57,071
But hoping not to make a complete fool
of myself out there...

2066
02:25:57,400 --> 02:26:00,597
...I just signed Willie Beamen
as my starting quarterback...

2067
02:26:00,800 --> 02:26:03,314
...and franchise player for the Aztecs.

2068
02:26:04,920 --> 02:26:09,311
So, Miss P, I look forward to seeing you
next season across those sidelines.

2069
02:26:13,200 --> 02:26:15,236
So long... Au revoir...

2070
02:26:16,440 --> 02:26:18,795
See you when the clouds come home.

2071
02:26:20,720 --> 02:26:23,837
Especially you, baby.
Smoking cigars on me now, are you?

2072
02:26:24,920 --> 02:26:26,035
Gotcha!

2073
02:26:29,920 --> 02:26:31,751
Thought we had him tied up!

2074
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:51,069
All right, little man!

2075
02:27:51,320 --> 02:27:53,390
What's up? What's your name?

2076
02:27:54,520 --> 02:27:57,034
Hey, what up, man? What up? What up?

2077
02:28:00,080 --> 02:28:01,593
How y'all feeling?

2078
02:28:04,600 --> 02:28:07,751
All right, now.
Y'all be looking out for the game now.
