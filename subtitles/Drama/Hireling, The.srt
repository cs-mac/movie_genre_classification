1
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,512
Lady Franklin!

2
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,911
Lady Franklin!

3
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,708
- Lady Franklin!
- Get out of it!

4
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,230
- Lady Franklin!
- She's over by the pond.

5
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,199
Lady Franklin, Dr Mercer is waiting to see you.

6
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,630
- Dr Mercer's waiting to see me?
- To see you before you leave.

7
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,478
- To see me before I leave.
- Today, Lady Franklin.

8
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,511
You're leaving today, you remember?

9
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,791
Now, Louise, come along.
It's much too cold out here.

10
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,831
Go back to the house.

11
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,791
This way.

12
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,072
- Are... Are you sure it was today?
- Yes.

13
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,795
I'm not absolutely certain it's convenient today.

14
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,151
# Over The Hills And Far Away

15
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,192
# Over the hills and far away

16
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,073
# Were I sold on lndian soil

17
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,190
# Soon as the burning day was clos'd...

18
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,271
I do feel better most of the time.

19
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,955
Still a little down in the mornings, hm?

20
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,991
Yes.

21
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,750
Your general health is really very good now,
Lady Franklin.

22
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,791
It has been a rest.

23
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,116
Well, a nervous breakdown
requires a rest from the world,

24
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,550
as much as it does drugs or understanding.

25
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,509
But everybody's been very understanding.

26
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,519
I want you to continue the pills...for a while.

27
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,436
They do help.

28
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,189
Yes, they help to even out your moods.

29
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,231
Oh, yes, they do.

30
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,349
I feel much more even.

31
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,238
I did it deliberately, you know.
Quite deliberately.

32
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,398
Now, Lady Franklin, we've been over this
often before. You were disturbed.

33
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,635
- Depressed.
- It was intentional.

34
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,274
Yes, of course. A symptom of your depression.

35
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,709
Now that's over and done with.

36
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,835
I still feel it a little bit in the mornings.

37
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,871
You need people now.

38
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,990
A normal life.

39
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,311
Don't know many people.

40
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,231
- In London, you see, we didn't really know...
- Well, make new country friends.

41
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,271
Find new activities.

42
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,517
So...I'm ready to go, then.

43
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,993
You are.

44
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,791
Well, then, I suppose I must.

45
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,435
Norman!

46
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,279
Well, goodbye, then, Lady Franklin.
Please don't hesitate to...

47
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,311
Oh, Sister...

48
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,035
Please call me if you should be worried
about anything. If I'm not here...

49
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,640
- Norman...
- Sister will know where I can be reached.

50
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,757
Please give my regards to your mother
when you see her.

51
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,360
Nice to see you looking so well.

52
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,591
Lansdowne Crescent, my lady?

53
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,479
What?

54
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,159
Lansdowne Crescent, my lady?

55
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,553
- What did you say?
- Lansdowne Crescent, my lady?

56
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,989
Yes, thank you very much.

57
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,511
Are you employed by my mother?

58
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,438
We're a private car hire firm, my lady.

59
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,119
Quite large. I don't know who booked the job.

60
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,151
I suppose it was my mother.

61
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,191
Expect it was, yes, my lady.

62
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,311
Like the window up, my lady?

63
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,911
No, thank you.

64
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,111
But if you'd like it...

65
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,878
I don't mind at all, my lady.

66
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,157
Well, perhaps, then.

67
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,628
If you...don't really mind.

68
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,670
Doesn't bother me either way, my lady.

69
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,109
- Perhaps it would be better closed.
- Certainly, my lady.

70
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,791
Good driving is really quite an art, I suppose.

71
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,832
Well, I don't know about an art, exactly.

72
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,117
More of a skill, perhaps.

73
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,071
A skill, then.

74
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,796
- More of a knack, perhaps.
- Yes, that does describe it very well.

75
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,629
A knack.

76
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,838
I really am...going to have to learn...the knack.

77
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,271
Driving, do you mean, my lady?

78
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,877
Mm? Talking to people.

79
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,514
You seem quite good at that, my lady. I mean...

80
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,676
you're chatting away to me all right.

81
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,231
- So I am.
- You certainly are.

82
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,157
Yes, I am, aren't l?

83
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,634
Do you prefer any particular route, my lady?

84
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,671
Not really.

85
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,600
Such fun, just driving along like this.

86
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,709
Would you go via Radley, please?

87
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,671
Certainly, my lady.

88
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,714
Would you slow down for a moment, please?

89
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,751
Look what I've got!

90
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,158
We've passed it.

91
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,191
Beg your pardon, my lady?

92
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,910
Helen, my darling.

93
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,474
- Hello, Mother.
- How was the journey?

94
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,956
- Where do I send the account?
- Send it to Radley Grange, if you would.

95
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,231
- Thank you very much for a very pleasant ride.
- Thank you, my lady.

96
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,280
I must say, you look quite transformed.

97
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,831
You look quite transformed.

98
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,831
More relaxed.

99
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,838
You do feel better, don't you?

100
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,957
I feel a little bit as though...

101
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,831
as if it...

102
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,920
- I feel better.
- You must get out more.

103
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,475
Everyone will want to see you, now that you're...

104
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,313
Cream?

105
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,915
You must make friends here, Helen.

106
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,474
Local people can be quite fun.

107
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,151
Do you have sugar? I can't remember.

108
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,271
Sugar - two.

109
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:33,714
After all, Tom...did r-represent the county...
i-in Parliament...

110
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,631
..in Parliament, didn't he?

111
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,077
We had very few friends here.

112
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,872
Yes, well...

113
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,593
I don't think London society
was very good for you.

114
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,996
It was too demanding.

115
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,793
But it's all I know.

116
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:56,550
I'm going to Paris next week and I shall arrange
for you to meet some nice people here.

117
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,592
- Oh, Mother, l...
- Helen, really, you must make an effort.

118
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,916
- I'd rather you didn't, really.
- Look, you can't go on mourning.

119
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,996
- Mother...
- You're young...

120
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,837
Please, I'm...

121
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,237
Did that doctor...fellow suggest anything?

122
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,032
Yes.

123
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,269
You've always resented me, haven't you, Helen?

124
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,113
Just because I didn't hide myself away in black
the moment your father died.

125
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,678
- Of course, if he were alive...
- Mother, he's not here. He is dead too.

126
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,593
I hope you're not going to become bitter, Helen.

127
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,911
Something to eat?

128
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,149
...at the front, George.

129
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,917
Helen...

130
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,071
Please, Helen, please.

131
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,751
Wasn't here.

132
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,031
They need...

133
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,591
They needed me.

134
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,391
I wasn't...

135
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,911
I was away.

136
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,111
I was away and they needed me,
they needed me, Mother!

137
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,791
I was away at a party.

138
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,831
A party.

139
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,270
At a party...at a party...

140
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,231
At a party...

141
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,070
- Change the oil.
- Right.

142
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,588
- Check the tappets.
- Right, right.

143
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,518
- Worried about that gasket.
- Nothing wrong with it.

144
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,269
- Check it again!
- Come on, Steven, she's running like a bird.

145
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,392
- Got to give perfect service in this business.
- She will.

146
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,911
She is beautiful.

147
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,191
I admit she was a bargain.

148
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,114
Keep her clean.

149
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,631
Put that rocker cover back.

150
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,275
- All right, Sergeant Major.
- Put on a good show for the customers.

151
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,313
- That's your department.
- I want to build up a first-class business here.

152
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,238
First-class business with first-class accounts.

153
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,910
Like that Lady Franklin yesterday.
She's a good account.

154
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,432
Oh, yes, she phoned.

155
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,073
- Why didn't you tell me before?
- Didn't make no booking. Just asked you to call.

156
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,795
Here I am, trying to build up a business,
you don't give me the orders?

157
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,478
You get her ready immediately!

158
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,551
I remembered, didn't l?

159
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,359
Beautiful? Bloody wearing me out, she is.

160
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,231
Right, then, Lady Franklin.

161
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,714
Very kind of you to think of us, my lady.

162
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,116
Just have to check the bookings
to make sure I'm available.

163
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,509
- You want a cup of tea?
- Yeah.

164
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,719
My lady? Yes, that'll be quite all right, my lady.

165
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,990
Bath to Radley. Thank you.

166
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,231
Told you she'd be a good client.

167
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,037
Funny woman, though.

168
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,277
- How do you mean?
- I don't know. She is a funny woman.

169
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,669
- Do you live near your work?
- Have to, my lady. Always on call, you see.

170
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,473
Would you rather live in the country?
I'm not sure I do.

171
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,717
- Nice to have a bit of green around.
- Nice. Very nice for children.

172
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,035
- Children like that, don't they?
- Yes.

173
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,635
- How many do you have?
- Children?

174
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,238
Yes.

175
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,278
Two, my lady.

176
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,390
Did you say two?

177
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,670
Yes, two.

178
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,991
We didn't have any children.

179
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,037
How old are they?

180
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,751
The girl, erm...Mary...

181
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,791
she's just going on four.

182
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,958
And, er...the boy...
young Steven, he's almost ten.

183
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,151
He is at school, then?

184
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,872
Grammar school, my lady.

185
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,674
Ten? That's very good, isn't it?

186
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,238
Yes, very good.

187
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,037
- What will you do with him?
- You mean in regards to work?

188
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,958
- Yes.
- Well, the army, I think.

189
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,991
Reckon it did pretty well for me.

190
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,837
Even during the war.

191
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,557
Regular soldier, were you?

192
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,592
Regimental Sergeant Major, I finished up,
my lady.

193
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,631
And what about your wife?

194
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,831
What does she...? Ah, we turn left here.

195
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,871
Thank you, my lady.

196
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,717
My lady?

197
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,471
My lady, are you all right?

198
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,191
Can I do it for you, my lady?

199
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,430
My lady...

200
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,516
My lady?

201
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,911
I'll open the window.

202
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,672
Are you sure you're all right?

203
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,031
Fine. Ab...solutely fine.

204
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,271
It's stuffy in here.

205
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,711
That's quite enough chatter.
Why don't you move the chairs before you start?

206
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,476
Can I help you? Did you want...?

207
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,470
Oh, my lady.

208
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,508
- I didn't know she was going to...
- You get back to your work, Edith.

209
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,273
I had no idea you were coming back today.

210
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,592
It's perfectly all right, Mrs Hansen.
I'm not staying.

211
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,351
You're looking very pale, my lady.

212
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,391
Will you take some lunch?

213
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,078
Yes, and the driver, too.

214
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,591
Yes, my lady.

215
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,437
It's nice to see you back.

216
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,591
Will you come this way, please, sir?

217
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,919
It's about time she showed her face in this place.

218
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,077
It's stopped raining, Edith.
You can put those sheets out.

219
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,590
They do go on a long time about it, these nobs,
with all this mourning.

220
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,632
- You've got to get on with it, haven't you?
- I always have.

221
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,671
Are you her chauffeur, then?

222
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,469
- I've got my own car hire business.
- Edith, get on with your work.

223
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,077
What would your wife do
if you were to die quite suddenly?

224
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,629
She'd have to get on with it, I should think.

225
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,877
- On with what?
- Life, I suppose.

226
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,911
Yes, that's very sensible.

227
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,474
Maybe she'd look around for another husband.

228
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,511
Would she?

229
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,393
Would she really? And how would she do that?

230
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,515
Well, you'd have to ask her that, my lady.

231
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,551
And you wouldn't mind?

232
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,716
Hard to argue if you're six foot under.

233
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,071
Your keys, my lady.

234
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,151
You're very practical, Ledbetter.

235
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,558
I've always had to be, my lady.

236
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,829
That...is just another knack.

237
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,749
I will have to learn.

238
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,998
- Ledbetter...
- Yes, my lady?

239
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,350
Would you mind very much
if I was to sit in the front?

240
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,993
No, well, l...I wouldn't mind, my lady.

241
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,952
Then l...think I will.

242
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,277
I've always wanted to sit in front.

243
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:40,157
- What does this do?
- Windscreen wiper, my lady.

244
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,715
Ledbetter, I wish you wouldn't call me "my lady"
all the time.

245
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,558
That sort of thing's going out very fast, you know.

246
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,636
What sort of thing, my lady?

247
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,353
That's right.

248
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,590
I don't think you like over-familiarity,
do you, Ledbetter?

249
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,754
I think we all have our place in life.

250
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,558
We don't all have our given places.
We make our own.

251
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,354
I don't think people talk to each other enough.

252
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,391
When I say talk, I mean...

253
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,431
communicate with each other.

254
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,755
Say what they really mean.

255
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,594
Actions speak louder than words, they reckon.

256
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,517
I don't think you really like me sitting here,
do you, Ledbetter?

257
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,074
I'm not sure it's very suitable, my lady.

258
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,078
And you're calling me "my lady" again.

259
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,839
Habits of a lifetime are very hard to break.

260
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,196
Does your wife think the same as you do?

261
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,191
I would say so, my lady.

262
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,716
What's she like?

263
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,751
I beg your pardon, my lady?

264
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,791
Your wife.

265
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,956
You mean in regards to appearance?

266
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,276
Yes. What does she look like?

267
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,311
She's a handsome woman, really.

268
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,956
If you don't mind my saying so, my lady,
she's not unlike yourself, in appearance.

269
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,389
You mean she looks like me?

270
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,991
Well, yes, the same kind of looks.
The same...colouring.

271
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,078
Yes. Surprising, really.

272
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,758
I'm very ordinary.

273
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:40,794
If I may say so, my lady,
I think quite the contrary.

274
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,951
Your wife, what's her name?

275
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,352
Frances.

276
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,914
You must be very happy.

277
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,951
Sometimes.

278
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,750
It's nice to know
there's somebody waiting for you, my lady.

279
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,953
Tuesday, Thursday, at 11, then.

280
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,991
My pleasure, my lady.

281
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,391
- Give us a bun.
- No, I won't.

282
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,715
- Mrs Roberts always does.
- Oh, please!

283
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,752
I've told you before.
Now, get out, both of you. Go on.

284
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,152
Another cup?

285
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,191
No, thanks.

286
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,231
- Sweet?
- No, thank you, Doreen.

287
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,475
It's plain with jam or plain with syrup.

288
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,511
Another cup of tea, please.

289
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,635
Shall I come over tonight?

290
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,270
- I've got work to do.
- Well, I'd like to come over sometime.

291
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,197
Stay all night.

292
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,232
- Steve.
- I've got a very early start in the morning.

293
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,669
Well, I'd like to come sometime.

294
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,111
How about the tea, Doreen?

295
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,232
Oh, it's whistle and I'll come to you,
my love, innit?

296
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,071
Yes, that's about it.

297
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,111
This train is for Bristol only.

298
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,151
Bristol only!

299
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,191
Mind the doors!

300
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,231
Mind the doors, please!

301
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,430
I haven 't been here
since my father brought me.

302
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,751
Quite a long way for you to come.

303
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,597
How's your wife?

304
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,871
- As a matter of fact, she's got a slight cold.
- Oh, I'm so sor...

305
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,275
Just slight. Sorry, my lady.

306
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,834
- You all right?
- Yes, thank you.

307
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,191
Do you help in the house?

308
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,754
Yes, well, we all pitch in together, you know.

309
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,031
Do you ever take your family out for picnics?

310
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,031
Yes, but not in the car, of course.

311
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,589
Why ever not?
Well, that wouldn't be suitable, my lady.

312
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,111
- Did I say something funny?
- No.

313
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,952
Nobody knows how it got here but it's quite old.

314
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,877
- It's not very good, is it?
- What do you mean?

315
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,718
Well, it doesn't look like a horse, does it?

316
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,031
But it is beautiful.

317
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,111
Beautiful?

318
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,799
Well...don't you think it's beautiful?

319
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,677
Well...I have my own ideas, my lady.

320
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,916
Those boring Lahills
want to give a dinner party for you.

321
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,791
I think you should go.

322
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,712
As a matter of fact,
I think you might rather like them.

323
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,551
I'd rather not, Mother.

324
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,758
I expect they'll invite some old friends of Tom's.

325
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,837
I'll see how I feel.

326
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,516
You miss Tom very much, don't you?

327
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,232
Would you like some...?

328
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,990
Thank you very much.

329
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,398
Pardon me, ma'am.

330
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,396
My dear, I know so well how you feel.

331
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,757
- I know you do.
- I was terribly disturbed when your father died.

332
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,270
Helen, you really must make an effort.

333
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,311
You must talk to people more.

334
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,951
Mother...

335
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:51,270
..when you go to Paris,
do you stay in a hotel or in your own rooms?

336
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,471
- In the apartment.
- I mean the apartment.

337
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,592
You'll love it now. I've just had it all redecorated.

338
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,870
I've got rid of all that awful old brocade.

339
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,390
It's all been done pale powder blue.

340
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,395
I don't think you've ever been there, have you?

341
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,590
Mother, I think I will go home to Radley Grange.

342
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,631
Is that wise?

343
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,672
I mean, you've only got Mrs Hansen
and that awful girl.

344
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,314
I shall use Ledbetter.

345
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,556
Ledbetter?

346
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:41,712
Percy, will you park the van up further?
These carpets are too heavy to carry by myself.

347
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,320
OK, OK, take it easy. Take it easy.

348
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,955
Put these in the back hall, Perkins.
Then get the books from the van.

349
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,958
Ledbetter, will you please
take those upstairs for me?

350
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,594
- Oh, yes, I want that one.
- Thank you, my lady.

351
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,197
Coming down.

352
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,835
Perkins! Give me those books.

353
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,871
The screen in the sitting room.

354
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,799
Asked me to bring these books in for you,
my lady.

355
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,951
Put them on the shelf.

356
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,037
I had a middle parting then.

357
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,553
Break!

358
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,591
Come on, use your weight!

359
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,631
Onslow, you keep your left up!

360
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,671
Hook him, Malcolm.

361
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,310
What do you want with all this, Steve?

362
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,874
First of all, I like it.
Secondly, the captain asked me.

363
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,469
- Captain Cantrip, his class. Do us a bit of good.
- Why do I do this?

364
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,954
Keep your left up! Because I asked you, didn't l?

365
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,471
Got a lovely little girl going out of her mind
with loneliness for me tonight.

366
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,511
I mean, I don't see why, Steve!

367
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,557
That's better, Onslow.
Put some punches together, Malcolm.

368
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,398
Put them together, Malcolm.
Two to the body, come on.

369
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,431
Bring his hands down, then hook him.

370
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,232
That's better.

371
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,748
We can get the Captain's business, can't we?

372
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,598
All right, so we make some lovely little accounts.

373
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,234
What about my love life? It's all right for you.

374
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,431
What does that mean?

375
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,152
Lovely lady, driving up front with you.

376
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,915
Maybe that's what she's going to give
instead of handing out tips.

377
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,238
Come on, Corporal.

378
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:32,159
Let's give them a little demonstration.
Give them a little lesson, shall we?

379
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,472
Come on.

380
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,318
Come on, Steve, we ain't got no gloves on!

381
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,351
You put your hands up.

382
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,391
You won't need no gloves.

383
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,597
- Yeah, come on, Sergeant Major!

384
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,108
- Watch it, Steve!
- You watch it!

385
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:07,111
When you speak of a lady,
speak of her with respect!

386
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,912
Up in the air!

387
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,191
All right, lads.

388
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,198
Back into mufti. Finish for today.

389
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,310
Come on, now. Clear off. Get out of it.

390
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,828
That's it for today. Good night, boys.

391
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,431
- Good morning, Mrs Hansen.
- I thought it was the electric man.

392
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,153
- The what man?
- The electric machine went wrong.

393
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,191
We've been waiting for him all morning.

394
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,879
- Is that him?
- No, my lady, it's Ledbetter.

395
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,230
Oh, Ledbetter,
you've heard of our little catastrophe.

396
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,430
Very inconvenient for you, my lady.

397
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,471
Hello?

398
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,317
Try...

399
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,079
He really puts on airs, that electric man.

400
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,994
Will you give that number another ring, then?

401
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,793
Of course, he's the only man for miles around.

402
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,354
- But he must be there.
- Could I be of any help?

403
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,438
- Could you?
- I'd like to have a look at it, my lady.

404
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,232
Well, it's down here.

405
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,670
- I'll wait here in case the man arrives, my lady.
- All right.

406
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,111
Careful.

407
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,071
Would you be so kind, my lady?

408
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,238
Thank you, my lady.

409
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,909
Boxing championships, Hong Kong.

410
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,236
Only thing the cheap tattoo merchant could do
was a dragon.

411
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,555
Better than a boxing glove, though.

412
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,152
Boxing?

413
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,670
Regimental championships, my lady.

414
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,311
May l?

415
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,000
You're a man of many parts, Ledbetter.

416
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,868
Yes, I know how to look after myself, my lady.

417
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,031
Right...

418
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,071
give it another try, shall we?

419
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,190
That's lovely, Ledbetter.

420
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,551
Mrs Hansen!

421
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,478
You can switch on now upstairs, Mrs Hansen.

422
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:32,512
It'll do for the minute, but to tell you the truth,
the whole thing needs looking at.

423
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,551
You need a new generator.

424
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,795
I did so much enjoy our outing last week.

425
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,511
I'm glad.

426
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,073
Did you get your wife that new coat
you promised her?

427
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,350
- Yes.
- Did she like it?

428
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,915
Well, my lady, it was a bit like the one
you wore last week.

429
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,951
You know, the brown one.

430
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,594
Brown suits you better - the colouring, I mean.

431
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:04,359
But that's what she wanted, you see.

432
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,714
Watch it, Harry. Too hard.

433
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,518
- Bring her round to the right!
- No, no, left again!

434
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,551
- Left! That's right.
- Right!

435
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,788
Out shopping, Sergeant Major?

436
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,308
- Good evening, my lady.
- Good evening.

437
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:34,148
You certainly gave Mr Davis a fright last night,
Sergeant Major.

438
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,191
The boys didn't half enjoy it.

439
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,276
Will you get that cart out of here?

440
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,473
Are you a friend of young Steven's?

441
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,670
- What?
- Onslow, would you mind, please?

442
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,029
Get that cart out of here for me, will you?

443
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,629
Hold it!

444
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,830
Forward a bit, forward.

445
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,671
Hold it, hold it.

446
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,277
Is he a friend of your son 's?

447
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,835
- He's one of the lads from the club.
- Club?

448
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,075
A boxing club, my lady.
I teach there sometimes.

449
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,192
- Really?
- Captain Cantrip asked me. I'm glad to help.

450
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,356
- Cantrip.
- Do you know him, my lady?

451
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,391
Yes, I do believe I do.

452
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,675
He was a liberal candidate
when my husband stood for Parliament.

453
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,950
Yes, well, he may have
some funny political opinions, my lady,

454
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,195
but he has a very good war record.

455
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,396
Perhaps I should support
some of these local activities.

456
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,876
I ought to do something for your club.

457
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,716
- What could I do?
- You could give them a cup, my lady.

458
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,751
Oh, what an excellent idea!

459
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,519
- The boys would like that, and the Captain.
- And you?

460
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,758
Well, I always liked it
when there was something worth fighting for.

461
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,189
The Lady Franklin Challenge Cup.

462
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,677
Oh, no, no.
No, the Sir Thomas Franklin Challenge Cup.

463
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,472
- Good morning, my lady.
- Good morning, Mrs Hansen.

464
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,750
It's nice to see you looking so well.

465
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,995
I'm sorry I'm late with your breakfast.

466
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,554
I had to see my son off at the station.

467
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:37,513
- How is he?
- He's going to a new place: St Dunstan's.

468
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:42,236
They'll teach him this Braille reading.
You know, where you read by touch.

469
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,911
He seems happy enough.

470
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,951
I don't know...

471
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,391
How selfish one is.

472
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,431
Not you, my lady.

473
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,911
Mrs Hansen!

474
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,431
Read this.

475
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,471
I've got butter all over it.

476
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,191
"Your Ladyship...

477
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:29,870
We, the undersigned committee
and members of the Radley Boxing Club,

478
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,480
wish to offer our thanks

479
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:36,115
and appreciation of your fine gesture

480
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,631
and gift of a silver challenge cup to our club. "

481
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,513
At 1900 hours, the ushers will be in position.

482
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,313
At 1930 hours, the public will be admitted.

483
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:51,480
At 1945, her ladyship will arrive,
driven by myself.

484
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,038
- Sergeant Major...
- Yes, sir?

485
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:58,550
I thought that I might pick up Lady Franklin,
don't you think?

486
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,630
Sir, I thought it would be very good,
a suitable gesture,

487
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,638
from the committee, sir, if my own car...

488
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,353
It's from my own firm, you see, sir.

489
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,193
It's a very nice gesture, Ledbetter.

490
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,231
Not at all, sir.

491
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,840
2000 hours, the first bout. Lightweight.

492
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,871
Mr Pettifer will referee.

493
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,118
This bout is not a very well matched pair,
so it may not run into three rounds.

494
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,197
So I think that will end about 2010.

495
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,231
Middleweight bout.

496
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,188
I was saying, sir, Mr Pettifer will again referee.

497
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,631
I don't think that the first effort
will quite have exhausted him, sir.

498
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:15,353
Oh, Ledbetter, I'm sorry I'm late.

499
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,391
Not at all, my lady.

500
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,512
We're running to schedule.
Just a few minutes behind.

501
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:24,030
A formal occasion, I quite understand.

502
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,354
I think I really am quite nervous, Ledbetter.

503
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,792
You mustn't worry, my lady.
We're all solidly behind you.

504
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,752
- I haven't been out since...
- Yes, my lady?

505
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,390
Be lucky if we get a seat tonight.

506
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,988
- Still nervous, my lady?
- No, I'm fine now.

507
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,991
Sit in these chairs here.

508
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:37,990
- Good evening, Lady Franklin. How do you do?
- Good evening.

509
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,270
You're looking remarkably well, Lady Franklin.

510
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,676
- You got held up, I suppose?
- Something political, I expect?

511
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:47,269
- Is Captain Cantrip coming?
- He'll be here, miss.

512
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,436
May I introduce Dr Henderson?

513
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,914
- Good evening, Lady Franklin.
- Good evening.

514
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:55,316
If you could sit here, my lady.

515
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:58,591
- Magnificent cup, Lady Franklin. Delightful.
- Oh, do you like it?

516
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,789
Yes. Marvellous.

517
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:03,355
- Good evening, Lady Franklin.
- How nice to see you again.

518
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,959
Ledbetter.

519
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,514
- Ledbetter?
- Excuse me, my lady.

520
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,551
Don't leave me alone.

521
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,591
Come and sit here till he comes.

522
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:16,074
Thank you, my lady.

523
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:25,517
- lsn't your wife here tonight?
- My wife doesn't like...

524
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:29,838
Oh, excuse me.
Are you going to adjudicate the first few bouts?

525
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,758
No, Mr Pettifer,
I'll stay here until the Captain comes.

526
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,756
Yes, well...

527
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:40,794
As I was saying, my lady, my wife doesn't like
boxing. I think it makes some women nervous.

528
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,831
Oh, does it?

529
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,752
Oh, yes.

530
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,118
Ahem... Ladies and...

531
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:10,630
- Speak up!
- Would you mind if I had a cigarette, my lady?

532
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:14,832
Oh, no, not at all.
Actually, I think I might have one too.

533
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,998
The first contest is a...a...bantam-weight bout,

534
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:24,319
between Farrell in the blue sash
and Collins in the red sash.

535
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,475
I suppose I'd better go to this...

536
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:57,749
Connie?

537
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,791
Yes?

538
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:02,195
It's all right, I'm coming.

539
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,158
I suppose I must go to
this ridiculous boxing match.

540
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,679
Careful.

541
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,917
- Right. Drink it while it's hot, all right?
- I've got it.

542
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,349
Yeah, well, if... Oh, look at this mess.

543
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,834
- My clean sheets!
- Sorry.

544
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,394
If you must, you must. Really!

545
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,871
Sorry.

546
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,432
What a very undemanding woman you are,
Connie.

547
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,631
So long as I get what I want.

548
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,196
I suppose it won't matter much
if I miss the first few fights.

549
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,510
Go on!

550
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,558
The boy in the red sash
did much better that round.

551
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,558
- Not enough though, my lady.
- It was a good try though.

552
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,672
- But not enough.
- The winner: Weatherly, in the blue corner.

553
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,591
I told you so.

554
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26,393
Another couple of rounds and he would've won.

555
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,829
But the thing is, my lady, that was the last round.

556
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,512
Well, anyway...

557
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,916
Well, anyway, you rather liked it, didn't you?

558
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,916
Yes. I must say, it's quite riveting.

559
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,632
Isn't it a bit brutal, though?

560
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:42,150
Those two? Those two are
about as brutal as a bag of doughnuts.

561
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:44,316
Oh, I think they're trying quite hard.

562
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:47,272
You should have seen some of our army bouts,
my lady.

563
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,437
Excuse me now. I've got to go and referee.

564
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,318
I must be there for the prize-giving.

565
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,351
Don't worry, darling.

566
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,597
You're always there
when the prizes are being given out.

567
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,438
That's my coffee. It's got sugar in.

568
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:11,790
- You haven't got a handkerchief, have you?
- Mm, yes, sure.

569
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,234
There you are.

570
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:29,158
I wonder if you'll make me late
for Cabinet meetings one day.

571
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,192
I'll do my best. But if I don't, someone else will.

572
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,158
God - the time!

573
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:41,035
I won't bother to walk you to your taxi.
Someone might recognise you...or me.

574
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,548
- You're so practical.
- Yes.

575
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,160
- We both are, aren't we?
- Yes.

576
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,191
- It's nice, isn't it?
- Mm.

577
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,071
- There you are.
- Thank you.

578
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,712
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

579
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,152
Break!

580
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,671
Go on!

581
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,191
Go on! Go on!

582
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,834
Stop boxing! Stop boxing!

583
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,872
- What's he saying?
- Warning them for leaning.

584
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,912
Oops! Sorry.

585
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,071
I'm so sorry I'm late.

586
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:50,111
Constituency party business.

587
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,628
I've no need to tell you how they go on and on.

588
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,598
I'm Hugh Cantrip.

589
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,995
Oh, yes, of course.
We have met, two or three times.

590
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:01,476
Notably when your distinguished husband
beat me hollow.

591
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:05,035
- lncidentally, I was so sorry to hear...
- Thank you very much.

592
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,196
You've missed some very exciting sport.

593
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,993
Well...needs must.

594
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,554
- Where are we?
- This is the last bout.

595
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,795
God, how awful.

596
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:20,709
Still, you're the one
whose presence was essential tonight.

597
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,990
Quite a lovely cup. Thank you.

598
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,349
Glad you could make it, sir.

599
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,511
Stop boxing!

600
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,754
The winner...Thomas Torrington.

601
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,235
Bravo. Very good show.

602
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,350
So glad I caught the grand finale.

603
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,994
You must tell me about the rest of it at dinner.

604
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,758
Oh, is that on the agenda?

605
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:00,270
I think the least the club can do
is feed its benefactress.

606
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:03,312
- Well, if it's official...
- Very official.

607
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:07,638
2230 hours, chairman will entertain
Lady Franklin for dinner at the Avon.

608
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,671
The Avon?

609
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:12,678
Good heavens! I haven't been there for years.

610
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:21,517
Good evening, sir. I thought
you weren't going to put in an appearance.

611
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:25,348
- Sorry, Sergeant Major. Party business.
- Pity you didn't mention it before, sir.

612
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,836
It's difficult for us to vote for
the best boxer of the evening without you.

613
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,235
I'm perfectly content to abide by your decision.

614
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,078
In any case,
I don't know too much about boxing either.

615
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:38,398
In that case, sir, if it's all right with you,
we thought that young Torrington...

616
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:40,431
The winner of the last bout?

617
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:51,671
I do think young Torrington was far and away
the most stylish boxer of the evening.

618
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:54,792
- Do you agree?
- Well, I'd like to give them all prizes.

619
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,478
Yes, I do agree.

620
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,670
Well, in that case...

621
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:08,593
My lady, Mr Chairman,

622
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,393
members of the committee,
ladies and gentlemen...

623
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,838
The Sir Thomas Franklin Challenge Cup
for the most promising -

624
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:19,919
the most stylish boxer of the evening,
Mr Thomas Torrington.

625
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,632
Congratulations, Torrington.

626
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:23,718
Your party will destroy it.
It will never recover.

627
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,957
Your coffee and brandy will be served shortly.

628
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,877
Thank you.

629
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:32,595
..by a huge majority. A huge majority.

630
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:46,070
Do you know,
you're entirely different to what I expected.

631
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,156
Am l? Some sugar?

632
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,191
No, no.

633
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,231
You're different too.

634
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,271
In what way different?

635
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,311
Tell me the truth.

636
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:59,113
All right, then. I will.

637
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:04,953
I always thought that you were...
a rather conceited popinjay.

638
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,073
Well, that sounds like
a Sir Thomas Franklin expression.

639
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:12,590
Oh, no, no. No, Tom always thought
that you had great ability.

640
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,676
Well, that's nice.

641
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,277
And charm.

642
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:19,514
That's nicer.

643
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,997
Well, l...

644
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:49,429
..killed the old tradition of moderation,

645
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:52,756
instead of which,
he left everything to Lloyd George in Paris.

646
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,995
- You know her?
- I'm not sure.

647
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:58,077
I suppose you must do.
She's been talking politics all evening.

648
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:00,111
Yes, I know. It's pretty boring.

649
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:07,037
I er...I always thought
that you were...rather stiff and proud.

650
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,150
- Oh, dear.
- And cold.

651
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,191
Very Lady of the Manor, indeed.

652
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:15,793
I don't think I'm much like
the Lady of the Manor.

653
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:20,034
It's nice that we were both so very wrong.

654
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,635
- Vodku.
- Vodku.

655
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,433
Pravda. I konyaku.

656
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:33,516
Two cognacs, please.

657
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:41,671
Bloody foreigners.

658
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:59,072
Bloody foreigners.

659
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,590
- Thank you, sir.
- Good night.

660
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:26,950
- Hope we'll see you again, sir.
- Yes, very soon. Thank you.

661
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:30,751
What a beautiful evening.

662
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,792
"We'll entrap an English evening's magic hush."

663
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,472
Who wrote that?

664
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:40,752
I'll think of another poem. Ahh, let me see...

665
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:44,434
Sergeant Major,
I hope we haven't kept you up too late.

666
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:47,358
Ledbetter, did you get something to eat?

667
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,755
Don't worry about the old regimental war horse.

668
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,791
They always get their oats.

669
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:53,796
The Grange, Ledbetter. Then take me home.

670
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:56,035
Thank you, sir. Thank you, my lady.

671
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,072
"From where we were,

672
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:02,112
It seemed that England was suspended
in a never-ending summer."

673
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,799
"And is there honey still for tea? "

674
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,471
Grantchester!

675
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:11,034
- Rupert Brooke.
- Rupert Brooke, of course.

676
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:15,195
"Ah, God.

677
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:20,360
To see the branches stir
Across the moon at Grantchester. "

678
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:29,073
The rhyme was a little weak,
but the nostalgia was very strong.

679
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:31,634
It's exactly how we felt out there.

680
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,714
Was it very bad?

681
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,909
Well, you are back now.

682
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,951
Am l?

683
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,278
Sometimes, I wonder.

684
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,471
Making good money.

685
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:20,272
Can we have someone to help round here?

686
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,197
Well, answer it, Steve!

687
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,149
Look, you're the bloody office round here.

688
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,270
I'm just the bleeding working class.

689
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:00,754
Hallo? Ledbetter's Motors.

690
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,517
Lady Franklin.

691
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,511
Herself?

692
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:11,551
Hang on. Hang on.

693
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,591
All right.

694
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:20,351
Thank you.

695
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:26,718
Her housekeeper wants you to pick up
some shopping, take it on up to the Grange.

696
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,876
You take it.

697
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:33,914
Ahh! Look, I've only got this whole bloody heap
to put together again, haven't l? Go on!

698
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:36,679
She's still the best bloody client we've got.

699
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:03,713
Two weeks without hearing from her and,
when she does call, it's her bloody housekeeper!

700
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,516
Oh, thank goodness. What a blessing.

701
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:23,429
- You've been entertaining a lot, haven't you?
- Like Lion's Corner House, it's becoming here.

702
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:29,151
Lovely lunch party yesterday: Captain Cantrip
and some of the political bigwigs.

703
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:33,193
They didn't half get through some wine.
And what they did to the best Champagne...

704
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,958
Captain Cantrip's been here, has he?

705
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,390
Well, it's nice to see
Her Ladyship enjoying herself.

706
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:41,318
- Let me help you with that, Mrs Hansen.
- Oh, thank you.

707
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,794
I expect we'll have to look round for more help
if we're gonna be busy again.

708
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,592
Oh, that silly girl.

709
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:55,916
I suppose, Mr Ledbetter,
you never thought of going into service?

710
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:58,110
- No.
- I only mentioned it.

711
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:01,436
- Mrs Hansen?
- A good position here for the right man.

712
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:03,516
Oh, Ledbetter, don't go for a moment.

713
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:28,749
Ledbetter, it is good to see you.

714
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:36,111
It seems simply ages
since that marvellous evening you arranged.

715
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:40,232
I was wondering what had happened to you,
my lady.

716
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:42,271
I have been so busy since then.

717
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:44,914
It is...ridiculous.

718
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:52,435
But I will be needing you,
for one or two days next week.

719
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,835
I hope I'm available.

720
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:56,871
Oh, are you very busy, then?

721
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:58,433
Hardly.

722
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,550
Oh, so you don't want my custom?

723
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,831
Of course I do and you know that.
You must know I do, my lady.

724
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:05,871
Well, what is it, then?

725
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:10,993
To tell you the truth,
I may not be in the hiring business much longer.

726
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,952
I don't understand. You are getting work, surely?

727
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,275
Work? Oh, yes, there's plenty of work.

728
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:20,074
But I'd probably earn more money working
for somebody else, for a master, you see.

729
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:23,635
I'm afraid I don't know much
about these kind of things.

730
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:27,195
Well, it's the expenses, the overheads, you see.

731
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:29,435
Yes, I suppose there must be...

732
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,914
Though I still don't quite see, though.

733
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,951
Payments on the car.

734
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,991
Payments?

735
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:41,749
I really don't want to involve you in my problems,
my lady.

736
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,950
I've told you a great deal about mine.

737
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,592
Yes, well, that's different.

738
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:50,599
Look, I owe it to you to listen, if you want to talk.

739
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:54,428
And you owe it to me
to trust me if there is something wrong.

740
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:58,597
Well, I'm going bust,
that's why I won't be able to see you again.

741
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:00,198
Bust?

742
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:01,036
Broke.

743
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,991
I'm behind with the payments on the car.

744
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,998
After the war, I went to an auction
and bought it very reasonable,

745
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:09,350
but I had to go to a money-lender for cash.
Now he can take away the car.

746
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,436
But he can't do that, surely?

747
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:13,232
Oh, yes, he can.

748
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:15,396
But, Frances...

749
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,510
Oh, she'll be so upset.

750
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:21,189
Well, that's another thing,
Frances is sick and treatments cost a lot.

751
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:22,912
Ledbetter, may I help?

752
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,592
Oh, no.

753
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,232
Why not?

754
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:30,157
Because it isn't your responsibility.

755
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,760
Now that you've told me, of course it is.

756
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:39,311
No, my lady, l...I'll just sell the business.
I'll move away from here, somewhere else.

757
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:43,399
But, moving away, how can that possibly help?

758
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:46,398
No, I've got to straighten this out for myself,
my lady.

759
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,556
How much is involved?

760
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,716
A lot.

761
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,472
How much?

762
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,836
Well, it's almost $400.

763
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,831
What is your first name?

764
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:15,472
Ledbetter, your first name?

765
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,954
Steven with a V.

766
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:33,396
- Here. Take it. I absolutely insist.
- I can't.

767
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:36,716
You have to. It's a present.

768
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:40,912
If I was to take that...

769
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:42,791
You must.

770
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:45,479
You have to call it a loan, my lady.

771
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,110
Call it what you will.

772
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:52,635
No, I can't take that.

773
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:58,957
- It is the least I can do.
- My lady, it isn't right.

774
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,798
- I have never done anything for anyone.
- That is not true.

775
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:05,674
My family gave me everything they could.
My husband gave me everything else.

776
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:09,110
I waited till it was too late to thank him,
to show him my gratitude.

777
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:11,720
- You have given me something very important.
- Have l?

778
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:15,992
Yes. When I desperately needed someone
to talk to, you were there. I never was.

779
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:18,156
When my father needed me, I wasn't there.

780
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:22,113
When my husband died, I was out
enjoying myself at a stupid, stupid party.

781
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:25,471
I insist on it, Steven.

782
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,511
Please let me help.

783
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:31,471
Thank you, my lady.

784
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:07,556
400 bleeding quid.

785
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,077
You know what that means?

786
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:18,635
We could buy a new car.
Buy a whole bloody fleet of 'em.

787
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:22,069
I told her I was a married man.

788
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,839
You what? What did you do that for?

789
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,835
I don't know how I took it from her.

790
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,552
She's a bad case.

791
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:35,513
Their own men can't give 'em enough,
gone all soft and nancy.

792
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:40,271
She gave you 400 quid,
cos you're such a lovely, safe driver?

793
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,629
You're like a virgin, squire.

794
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:45,557
It's all mine.

795
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:50,715
It's all rotten, filthy, dirty, stinking mine.

796
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:52,193
Ow!

797
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:58,232
Oh, yes, I remember the family very well.
There was Richard. He was the eldest.

798
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:02,671
It was ridiculous. Do you know, she said
they'd gone out and John had gone to sleep.

799
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:07,830
The state is absolutely powerless...

800
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:21,473
- She went to see them.
- She married Colonel Frederick Trotter,

801
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:24,239
has a place down in Hertfordshire.

802
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:27,636
- I know her. I'm not wearing any of that...
- Married John Parker...

803
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:30,990
- Well, it's...
-..who's a local squire and...

804
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,952
It's been lovely to s... Sorry. Oh, sorry.

805
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:39,871
Well, it's lovely to see you all again
and very good of you to come,

806
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:44,869
but I'm afraid it is time to pay the piper

807
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:50,199
and l...would like to ask Captain Cantrip
to say a few words.

808
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:56,997
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

809
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:59,031
Erm...

810
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:02,356
Well, I'm afraid that listening to me
is almost too high a price

811
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:06,757
to pay for even a superb lunch
as that which Lady Franklin has given us.

812
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,189
Huxley...Donald Shapston...

813
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:17,792
Well, the fact is, the thing I'm going to talk about
is a subject we'd all carefully avoid

814
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,513
if we all met at the same table.

815
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:26,038
Well, the one thing that we have in common,

816
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:29,072
apart from a tremendous regard
for Helen Franklin,

817
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:35,195
and that is...a profound regard for our county
and our country.

818
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:37,754
Hear, hear.

819
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:41,759
I know that, since the war, many of us
have asked ourselves the question,

820
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:47,113
does our-our country
or our erm...or our party come first?

821
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:50,391
Because, as we all know, the...

822
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:54,353
He's no fool. Liberals don't stand
a chance here, anyway.

823
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:57,073
..because of the interests of various parties.

824
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:02,911
And, well, sadly, this constituency, which was
so superbly represented in past years,

825
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:07,033
- must now seek a new representative.
- Sir Thomas died very suddenly, didn't he?

826
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:11,073
I am glad to say that
I shall be presenting myself on this occasion.

827
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:14,795
Not as a member of the Liberal Party,
but as an independent.

828
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:18,469
If you're going to cross the Rubicon,
you might as well do it after a good lunch.

829
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,954
She's bound to bring him
some of the old supporters.

830
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,150
She might bring him quite a bit more than that.

831
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:30,239
Lady Franklin does share my feelings
about this matter.

832
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:34,159
And, indeed, my feelings
about the political urgencies of the time.

833
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:39,194
And er...I shall be making a more official speech
at the meeting tonight.

834
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:42,711
Well, l...

835
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:44,751
Thank you.

836
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:52,711
Yes, well, Anna Maria,
she was the luckiest of the lot,

837
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:55,638
because she married the first Baron Hunsdon.

838
01:17:55,680 --> 01:18:00,231
But it was the other side of the family
that was infinitely more interesting,

839
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:03,317
because they had some estates in Scotland,
Ayrshire, I think.

840
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:06,794
They go back to Malcolm lll, I believe.

841
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:09,712
.. and I said to her...

842
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:22,033
So...the end of another utterly beautiful day.

843
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:26,676
Yes, it has been a lovely day, but I do wish
you'd let me come to the meeting tonight.

844
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:30,190
I would love you to come,
but I don't think it would be politic.

845
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:32,310
It might even be a little unpleasant.

846
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,831
Hugh...

847
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,788
I feel you wouldn't be making this stand
if it hadn't been for our talks together.

848
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,831
I do feel a bit responsible.

849
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:45,871
Yes, you are.

850
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:49,356
You're responsible for an awful lot
that's been happening to me lately.

851
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,914
But I think it would be best if you didn't come.

852
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,951
All right.

853
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,111
Goodbye.

854
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:25,031
I know many of you who also put Britain first.

855
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:29,551
Together, we shall march forward bravely
to meet whatever the future may bring.

856
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,558
Thank you all very much. Good night.

857
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,751
Thank you.

858
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,434
This is the Captain's car, isn't it?

859
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:48,948
Yes, it is, ma'am.

860
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,798
I bid you all a hearty good night.

861
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,308
I thought l...

862
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:57,591
Would you support Direction of Labour, sir?

863
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:01,155
- You know I don't like surprises, Connie.
- Neither do l.

864
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:04,476
- Where would you like to go, sir?
- Pemberton Drive.

865
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:07,791
Yes, that'll do.

866
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:28,631
Well?

867
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:31,671
Well, what?

868
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:39,759
Look, nothing's changed between us
and nothing will change, whatever happens.

869
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:43,234
- I'm sure you'll keep on paying the bills.
- Oh, Connie.

870
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:46,477
And I'm sure you'll always come back...
whenever it's discreet.

871
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,317
Don't be unfair, my dear.

872
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:51,830
No, Hugh, don't you being unfair.

873
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:56,988
- Look, you said yourself...
- I don't care if you neglect the bills,

874
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:59,759
so long as you never, ever neglect me.

875
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:02,155
I think I know your requirements
well enough by now.

876
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:03,428
Exactly.

877
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,911
Just make sure you go on supplying them.

878
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,838
What a very unromantic creature you are,
Connie.

879
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:14,395
Yes, I leave romance
to the ladies and gentlemen who invented it.

880
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:20,591
God.

881
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:24,711
Pemberton Drive, sir.

882
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:26,910
What?

883
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,951
Pemberton Drive, sir.

884
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,351
Well, that's fine. Thank you.

885
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:45,711
At least you could see me to the door.

886
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:47,751
Of course.

887
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:14,548
I er...I shan't be needing you any more tonight,
Ledbetter.

888
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:17,672
- I feel like a bit of a walk.
- Thank you, sir.

889
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:21,235
Well...good night.

890
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:23,271
Good night, sir.

891
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:41,071
Dear Lady Franklin...

892
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:46,471
My lady,

893
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:48,511
Captain...

894
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:51,438
It has come to my notice that Captain...

895
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,831
Dear... My lady...

896
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:06,198
Don't forget you've got to pick up Mrs Druce.

897
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:23,915
Surely this isn't the usual way I go?

898
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:26,315
I thought it might make a change for you,
madam.

899
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:28,157
I don't like changes.

900
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,952
I like the old way.

901
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,831
Sorry, madam.

902
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:38,198
Whatever is it?

903
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:41,198
A bit of a breakdown.

904
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:43,674
Most inconvenient.

905
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:47,918
Sorry, madam. I shall
have to try and find a telephone, madam.

906
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:51,919
That's another thing I don't like: telephones.

907
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,311
I shall only be a few minutes.

908
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:06,751
And I don't like being left alone, do l?

909
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:12,355
Oh, all right, all right. Patience, patience.

910
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:18,153
- Oh, Mr Ledbetter...
- Our car's broken down, Mrs Hansen.

911
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:21,829
- Could I use your telephone, please?
- Yes, I'm sure that'll be all right.

912
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:24,553
- I've got a client in there, you see.
- Oh, dear.

913
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:27,990
- How's Her Ladyship?
- Quite a gadabout. It's nice to see it.

914
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:31,589
- She's in, then, is she?
- Yes, she's in her room doing her letters.

915
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:37,800
..we arrive at lunchtime,
we'll be able to have tea in the house.

916
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:40,115
I'm sure you'll be delighted to know...

917
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:54,916
I don't think I really want to go
all the way to London, Hugh.

918
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:58,520
No, I'd love to, in one way...

919
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:01,313
I'm not a nuisance.

920
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:05,158
Oh, you're very mean.

921
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:07,077
No, all right.

922
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:08,792
Yes.

923
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:12,749
Anything the matter?

924
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:15,392
No, nothing, I was just...

925
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:16,919
What?

926
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:20,236
- Nothing.
- 2:30.

927
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:23,511
- Mm.
- I said 2:30.

928
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:26,439
No.

929
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,555
- Number, please?
- Radley two-three.

930
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:44,512
- Two-three?
- Yes. Radley two-three.

931
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:56,272
No answer.

932
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:58,993
- Let it ring a bit, will you?
- Please yourself.

933
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:05,155
Hello? Lady Franklin 's residence.

934
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,228
Hello?

935
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:11,397
Yes, I want to speak to
the mistress of the house, please.

936
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:13,431
Is that Mr Ledbetter?

937
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:15,471
Hello?

938
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:17,954
Is that Mr Ledbetter?

939
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,912
- Yes it is, yes.
- She's got a dinner party.

940
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:24,396
Oh, it's Ledbetter, my lady.
I told him you had a dinner party.

941
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:27,830
- I'll talk to him.
- Her Ladyship will speak to you.

942
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:29,871
Very nice of her. Thank you.

943
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:33,913
Good evening. What is it, Ledbetter?
I'm rather busy at the moment.

944
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:35,951
Well, it's like this...

945
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:38,872
The thing is...

946
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:42,151
The thing is, I've just come back
and got a message from my partner

947
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:45,158
who's got shocking handwriting -
looks like your name, my lady.

948
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:48,272
- Says to call you immediately.
- I certainly didn't call.

949
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:51,032
Well, I'm sorry.

950
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:52,718
Must be somebody else, then.

951
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:56,309
I was going to call you this afternoon,
funnily enough.

952
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:58,157
Yes?

953
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:00,191
Do you happen to be free next Monday?

954
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:03,550
I shall spend the weekend at Alderton Manor
and I'll need collecting.

955
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,795
Oh, yes, certainly, my lady. What time?

956
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:08,638
I'd like to be there for luncheon. Alderton Manor.

957
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:10,557
Thank you.

958
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,989
I'm sorry to disturb your dinner, my lady.

959
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:16,634
Not at all. Good night, Ledbetter.

960
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:19,672
Good night.
Thank you very much. Good night, my lady.

961
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:29,917
Your present. You nearly forgot.

962
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:32,872
- Oh, Edwina, thank you. I'm so sorry.
- That's quite all right.

963
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:35,115
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.

964
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:38,869
- Don't forget, you can always use the villa.
- Thank you very much. Bye.

965
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,911
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

966
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:47,518
Oh, my.

967
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:49,949
Phew!

968
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:54,393
I think I've had a little too much Champagne.

969
01:27:55,640 --> 01:28:00,668
I hear you've been getting out and about a lot,
my lady, and seeing a lot of people.

970
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:02,711
People have been very kind to me.

971
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:05,399
And I'm feeling very happy.

972
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:09,271
You needed taking out of yourself.

973
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:19,755
I hear you've been seeing
a lot of Captain Cantrip, my lady.

974
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:26,115
What, do you mean people are talking?

975
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:31,119
Oh, I don't know.
Have they got anything to talk about?

976
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:37,913
They always have something to talk about,
if they want to talk, don't they?

977
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:40,554
Yes.

978
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:45,356
- They could talk about you and me, for instance.
- You and me?

979
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:49,111
Why should they want to do that?

980
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:55,068
Well, you're sitting in the front of the car,
my lady.

981
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:59,879
There's nothing wrong in that.

982
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:09,591
It's got stuck.

983
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:12,359
Could I do it for you, please, my lady?
Excuse me.

984
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:15,072
Thank you.

985
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:19,631
I'm quite exhausted.

986
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:30,512
Have I been asleep long?

987
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:33,472
- About half an hour, like a baby.
- Oh, dear.

988
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:35,909
You're beautiful.

989
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:39,711
My...

990
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:41,637
Oh, dear.

991
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:45,751
Beautiful.

992
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:49,154
I've kept you very late tonight, Steven.

993
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:53,438
- Do you think your wife would like these?
- I haven't got a wife.

994
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:55,471
- What?
- I haven't got a wife.

995
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:58,592
- I'm sorry?
- I never got married. I never wanted to be.

996
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:01,232
I don't understand.

997
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:04,953
- Frances and the children...
- The children don't exist.

998
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,878
- I thought that would make you interested.
- lnterested?

999
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:11,151
- I thought that's what you wanted to hear.
- Wanted to...

1000
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:13,191
Why... Why on earth should l?

1001
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:18,229
I didn't want you to think
that I didn't have something of my own,

1002
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:20,157
that I was all by myself.

1003
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:24,069
You're not by yourself.
You have your business.

1004
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:25,030
No.

1005
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:27,071
What?

1006
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:29,475
- I never thought of you as a lonely man.
- I am lonely.

1007
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:32,159
I'm lonely all the time you're not here.

1008
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:35,791
Ledbetter...

1009
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:38,718
I suppose I shouldn't say things like that.

1010
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:42,036
- Why shouldn't you if they're true?
- Every time you don't ring,

1011
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:45,755
every time I don't take you out, I think of you.

1012
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:47,950
I wonder what you're doing, who you're with.

1013
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,276
I tried to tell you on the telephone at the Grange
the other day.

1014
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:55,279
If I don't talk to you, I can't...
I can't talk to anybody about anything.

1015
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:59,711
At first, well, it was just like listening to a client,
then you go back to your own life.

1016
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:02,957
But I haven't got any life to go back to,
as everything is here with you.

1017
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:06,197
Ledbetter, l...

1018
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:09,391
I mean, we're a man and a woman, aren't we?

1019
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:12,273
- Oh, yes. Yes, we...
- I'm not just a chauffeur.

1020
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:15,073
You're not just Lady Franklin.
I'm not just somebody you hire, am I?

1021
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:17,236
No, no, of course not.

1022
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:20,955
- I mean, I am a man and you're a woman.
- Yes, w...

1023
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,434
Well, I love you.

1024
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:26,749
I love you.

1025
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:30,109
I love you, Helen.

1026
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:32,832
I love you.

1027
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:35,916
I love you. I love you.

1028
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:37,951
- I love you.
- Don't.

1029
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:41,072
- I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you.
- Please.

1030
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:42,951
I love you.

1031
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,719
I love you. I love you.

1032
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,637
No.

1033
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:52,391
Please don't. Will you stop it?

1034
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:54,908
Oh...stop, please!

1035
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:56,951
Ledbetter, stop it!

1036
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:10,431
You don't love me.

1037
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:15,156
I don't know the meaning of the word
and I don't suppose I ever will.

1038
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:17,191
I'm... I'm so sorry.

1039
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,592
I'm so sorry.

1040
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:27,671
I'm so...

1041
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:05,111
I seem to have made a fool of myself.

1042
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:13,875
I don't suppose you'll be requiring
my services any longer, my lady.

1043
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:17,279
No.

1044
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:25,791
Take me home, please.

1045
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:51,231
What's the matter, Steve?

1046
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:55,631
Did I do something wrong?

1047
01:34:57,880 --> 01:34:59,996
I'd do anything for you, you know that.

1048
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:04,429
Honest, Steve. I mean it.

1049
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:10,031
You know that I mean it, don't you?

1050
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:16,071
Don't you, Steve?

1051
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:25,799
Sounds like Ledbetter's car.

1052
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:37,717
Yes, Ledbetter, what do you want?

1053
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:40,915
What the bloody hell do you think you're doing?

1054
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,951
Ledbetter?

1055
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:46,071
What's the matter?

1056
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:50,238
You don't know what it means, do you? Love.

1057
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:53,590
- Is that what you said?
- Get out, Ledbetter, you're drunk.

1058
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:56,393
You told me everything about what you feel.

1059
01:36:56,440 --> 01:36:59,159
Does it matter what anybody else feels?

1060
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:03,478
Ledbetter, whatever you have to say,
this is neither the time nor the place.

1061
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:05,670
- Will you please go?
- Of course, l...

1062
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:09,110
Look, Sergeant Major,
whatever's on your mind must wait...

1063
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,471
Don't do that.

1064
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:18,235
Listen, I did my job well, didn't l?

1065
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:21,113
- I mean, I did what I was hired for.
- Oh, yes.

1066
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:24,630
Yeah, but now I want to speak,
you don't have the time to listen.

1067
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:30,232
Ledbetter, you have always been most kind
to me and I shall always be very grateful.

1068
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:37,196
Cap'n... Brave Cap'n.

1069
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:39,231
Nothing.

1070
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:42,511
You know what the Captain is? He's a cheat.

1071
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:45,711
- He's a liar.
- I'm going to call the police.

1072
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:51,673
That Captain is a liar.

1073
01:37:51,720 --> 01:37:54,917
Do you know what the Captain wants you for?

1074
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:57,349
He wants you for your money.

1075
01:37:57,400 --> 01:37:59,391
He's got a girl.

1076
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:03,274
He is doing... He is doing her day and night!

1077
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:05,595
I don't want to listen to this.

1078
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:09,154
You are embarrassing me
and making a fool of yourself.

1079
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:11,998
- Now, will you please leave?
- Yes, well, my lady,

1080
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:17,398
I'm just trying to tell you, I heard them -
I heard them in the back of our car.

1081
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:20,716
- Ledbetter, you're abusing a privilege...
- Privilege?

1082
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:25,349
Course I'm abusing a bloody privilege!

1083
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:28,073
My-my-my kind always does, doesn't it?

1084
01:38:28,120 --> 01:38:29,792
Doesn't it?

1085
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:33,150
We take every bloody diabolical liberty
in the book.

1086
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:37,557
I mean, and you say you keep 'em in their place,
and so we'll keep our own.

1087
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:43,709
So I'm supposed to be a chauffeur. A bloody
chauffeur, stuck on the end of the wheel.

1088
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:46,638
Right at the edge of the engine.
See nothing, hear nothing.

1089
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:48,671
Well, I tell you...

1090
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:53,751
I tell you something, Captain...Captain...

1091
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:58,835
We're nothing. I'm a bloody chauffeur.

1092
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:02,077
You're a gentleman, right?

1093
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:05,631
Well, I'll tell you something.

1094
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:09,879
You bloody people,

1095
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:12,150
you ladies and gentlemen,

1096
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:16,159
you make me ill.

1097
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:20,557
You make me...sick.

1098
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:25,031
Come on, Captain.

1099
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:27,071
Now, you hit me...

1100
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:29,111
You hit me...

1101
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:32,277
Mmm? You hit me once.

1102
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:36,393
- You hit me just once.
- Ledbetter.

1103
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:41,639
Captain Cantrip and I are going to be married.
Now, will you please leave immediately?

1104
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:55,751
All right.

1105
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:05,031
All right.

1106
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:08,873
Well, I suppose you got what you deserved.

1107
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,871
May I have a drink?

1108
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:35,277
# It's a long way to Tipperary

1109
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:40,110
# It's a long way to go...

1110
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:47,080
# Rule Britannia

1111
01:41:47,120 --> 01:41:50,829
# Britannia rules the waves

1112
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:58,558
# Britons never, never, never shall be slaves...

1113
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:34,952
# Mademoiselle from Armentieres, parley-voo

1114
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:40,437
# Mademoiselle from Armentieres, parley-voo

1115
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:44,756
# Mademoiselle from Armentieres...

1116
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:53,274
# Hinky, pinky, parley-voo...

1117
01:42:53,320 --> 01:43:00,749
# God save our gracious King

1118
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:07,512
# Long live our noble King

1119
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:12,509
# God save our King
