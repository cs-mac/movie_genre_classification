00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,940
Yo, babe! Yeah!
Gilly, Get up here!

3
00:01:04,201 --> 00:01:05,951
Yeah!!!

4
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,050
Let's go, babe!
We got bitches waitin'!

5
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,920
Go faster!
Zack, come on!

6
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,270
Ready!

7
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,320
Go! Go! Go!

8
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,980
Yeah, Zack!
Come on!

9
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,260
Hey ladies, we are here.

10
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,800
Get ready to party, yeah!

11
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,800
- Yeah!
We are here! Oh!!!

12
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,490
Dude, you're crazy.
- Yes I am.

13
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,390
- You're alright man?
Yes, I am.

14
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,500
- Let's do this.
- Let's go. Sure!

15
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,780
Check it out!

16
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,140
Gilly!

17
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,080
Guys, be right back.

18
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,700
- What's up, homey?
Check it out.

19
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,330
Good quality, you like?
- Thanks man, this is hot.

20
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,790
That's right. All right man.
Ooh!

21
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,510
-200 Bucks man.
- Dude, that's cruel.

22
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,410
No, it's fair price. I make the best
fake IDs in Pennsylvania.

23
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,770
You know what? You should
put that on your college application.

24
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:39,690
Dude, I can't believe... Like mainstream you guys!
You guys are so mainstream.

25
00:02:39,691 --> 00:02:40,751
I gotta get you some undergraduates.

26
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,540
- Heads up, Nathan.
- On your way.

27
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,800
Here we go again.

28
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,360
Uhh oh, here she comes.

29
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,860
- Hey, Karen.
- Hi, Nathan.

30
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,730
-Ops. Watch it!
- Watch it? Watch what?

31
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,210
You bumped into me.

32
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,860
Billy! Billy! I'm serious!
Listen to me. Billy, Billy!

33
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,970
Come on. Come on.

34
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,880
Serious? Wow!

35
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,910
That was exciting!
Let's go get drunk.

36
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:50,900
Oh wait wait wait, an announcement!
A little gift from my dad.

37
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:56,760
VIP tickets!!!
To the first Pirates home game.

38
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:01,850
- Dude, I would drink to that.
Let's have a good night, boys.

39
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,900
Let's do it!
Yeah!!!!

40
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,080
Uhh, I can't believe that.

41
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:25,840
Hey, wake up! Look,
whoever you are, you gotta get outta here.

42
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,690
My parents will be home in an hour.

43
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,390
Alright, girls, we gotta hurry up,
or my parents will kill me.

44
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,590
Is there more bags?

45
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,780
You know, you really don't have to
put in all the stuff.

46
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,040
It's okay.
It's the least I can do.

47
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,670
If my parents see you here, they
may get really pissed at me, though.

48
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,140
Yeah, mine too.

49
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,670
Perfect timing.

50
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,780
Alright, get those mittens
on and wake up.

51
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,740
I can't believe you're making
me fight hungover.

52
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,510
If you wanna drink like a man, let's see
if you can fight like a man. Come on, let's go.

53
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,130
Hit me!

54
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,140
Hit me! lt's not patty
cake. Punch me, here!

55
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,610
Move your feet!
Right here, not my arm. Come on!

56
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:36,620
Come on, hands up!
- My boys.

57
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,860
Hands up!
Come on!

58
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:44,330
- This is bullshit!
-I'll tell you what's bullshit.

59
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,610
Bullshit's gettin yourself drunk, but
you can't defend yourself.

60
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,360
You can't watch your back!

61
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,360
That's bullshit, son.

62
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,630
Come on, turn around. Let's go!

63
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,630
Kevin!

64
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,070
What?

65
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,100
Bet you glad you went out
last night, no?

66
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,690
Doesn't taste good on your way out,
as you did on your way in, I bet! Huh?

67
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:18,800
See, this is what I call a party.
Wanna hurt me, Nathan?

68
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,780
Don't get mad, get even,
donn't lose control.

69
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,950
Think about it, clear your head.
Now, focus!

70
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,060
Bear hug?
That's all you got?

71
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,760
Come on, your mother hits harder than that.
Show me something!

72
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:37,170
So slow. Come on!
Come on!

73
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,650
Use your head,
Nathan. Think!

74
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:44,930
You better show me something now
or you're gonna go down. Come on!

75
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,650
I thought we were boxing?

76
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,520
You've always said the person that ends
the fight was the winner.

77
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,550
Don't look like
I'm done?

78
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:02,520
You wanna play with no rules, you better
be careful what you let out of the box.

79
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,530
What? Get up!
That wasn't the part, Nathan.

80
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:12,050
What's the matter? Come on, use your
anger. Think about it. Keep control.

81
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,660
What're you gonna do? You can't punch me,
you can't kick me? What're you gonna do? Huh?

82
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,980
Come on!

83
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,910
That 's all you got?
Give me a balance.

84
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,710
You're gonna dance all day?
Gotta show me something!

85
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,990
Good shot. Hahaha!
Now we're talking.

86
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,160
I'm bigger than you, but you
can't take me, Nathan. Come on. Ahhh!

87
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:47,130
- Think I'm getting old.
- Hey, guys. Guys?

88
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:53,360
-Kevin!
- You got me. Finish me off!

89
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,620
- Enough!
-What? We're just working out.

90
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:02,360
- You two were trying to kill each other.
Nah, we're good. Right, Nathan?

91
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,590
Good job, son.

92
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:15,920
-Eww... God, you smell like beer.
Can I take a shower?

93
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,960
I just don't wanna get a phone call on night
you ride motorcycle around a tree.

94
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,710
I wasn't even driving.

95
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,350
Hey, you were out all night. You didn't call...
You're grounded for a week.

96
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,570
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm serious.

97
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,660
- Why? You don't trust me?
- After last night? Not so much.

98
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,200
Remember that phrase, Trust
needs to be earned...

99
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,210
Nathan, you don't belong to the yoga.

100
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,160
- He did.

101
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,240
-Tell him.
- You went to the yoga session?

102
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,150
- Mom took me.
Serious?

103
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,120
- And he's in pain the next day. When're you taking
yoga? You didn't ask me about taking yoga?

104
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,550
- I had to ask you everything that I do?
No....

105
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:06,720
- Your dad needs yoga.
- He has more important things to do than that.

106
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,110
-You really do need yoga.
- You should try... Tell me about it.

107
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,840
- Oh, it'll happen till a day I take up basket weaving.

108
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,990
Nathan, you're on clean up duty.

109
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,380
Come on. Your mother cooked,
I've worked all day. What do you do?

110
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,920
That's right.

111
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:58,530
You're getting better and better.

112
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,390
It's always my fault.
Every single time, Billy.

113
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,950
Because it's mostly your fault, Karen.
Have you even thought about that?

114
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,910
All you think about is football. You know, If you're so over
with this, then just get outta here.

115
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,060
- You know what? Leave!
- I'm will get outta here! I don't need this.

116
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,660
You're in high school, Karen. I can have
any girl I want in college.

117
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,330
What are you looking at? Freak!

118
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,260
Sometimes I do feel
like a freak.

119
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,880
I mean, I walk around like everybody else.

120
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,800
But inside... It just

121
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,520
Feel different.

122
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,700
Like I'm a stranger,
in my own life.

123
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:59,020
When I'm sitting at the breakfast table
with my parents...

124
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,100
I'm just like...

125
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,390
Who are these people?

126
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,680
Don't you think everybody feels
that way growing up?

127
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,170
Do you think they all go through a shrink?

128
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,200
Not everyone has insomnia, and
impulsivity and rage issues, Nathan.

129
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,460
I used your technique.

130
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,790
Last night,
this guy snapped at me and...

131
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:28,620
I had this overwhelming urge to run
across the street and smashed his face.

132
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,180
But you contained it.

133
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,540
Yeah.

134
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,190
I put the anger away.

135
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,380
I chilled.
It wasn't worth it.

136
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,450
That's great, Nathan.

137
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:47,580
Do you realise we probably would have been
having this discussion in juvenile court a year ago?

138
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,040
You're making progress.

139
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,910
I still have the dreams.

140
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,360
When was the last one?

141
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:09,100
- Two nights ago.
- Any new details?

142
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:14,840
No, mostly the same.
I see the woman standing there,

143
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:18,040
She starts singing to me.
I think it's a lullaby.

144
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,880
then comes the attack.

145
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,880
And then,
it's over.

146
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,180
Nathan, some dreams are based
in reality, but others are...

147
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:48,610
are minds in a way of handling anxiety,
just by pushing it deep into your subconscious.

148
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,870
That's not necessarily a bad thing.

149
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:53,680
Don't most psychiatrists want uhh...

150
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,660
on earth these things?

151
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,540
I'm not most psychiatrists.

152
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,390
Our time is up.

153
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,900
-Have a good week, Nathan.
Thanks.

154
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,150
- I think he won that match?
- Yeah, absolutely.

155
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,890
I think you guys are both dicks, okay?

156
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,980
I don't know how y'all convinced me
to join the wrestling team.

157
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,730
- It was your idea.
- Okay, it's fun, Gilly. It's fun.

158
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,430
But you know what? It's probably a lot of
fun when you're out there kickin' ass.

159
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:19,990
Well, let me tell you what, it's a lot less
fun when you're getting at this mad guy.

160
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,330
Come on, Nathan.
Come on. He got him! Got him!

161
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,720
He got it.
Take him down. Take him down!

162
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,870
Get him down man.
You got it!

163
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,800
Game over. Ahahaha!!!

164
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,090
Yeah, sure.

165
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:47,370
It's easy when you got just balls over for you.
I mean, come on, he didn't even put up a fight.

166
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,780
- Can you take him?
Yeah, probably.

167
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,880
Wooh, you joined in a militia group or something?

168
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:06,530
So, I go to the gun range like three to
four times a week to blow up steam.

169
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,480
I'm a virgin,
what else am I gonna do?

170
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:08,941
True.

171
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,440
- He was there, right?
- He was there, but he hasn't called me back.

172
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,550
Here we go again.

173
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,370
You look at her,
She glances back at you.

174
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:23,480
You both totally digging at each other.
And yet nobody pulls a trigger.

175
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:27,870
Grow up here. You make that happen man.
You act like you're afraid to talk to her?

176
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,720
I'm not afraid.

177
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,480
- I do not wanna go to class.
- Me neither.

178
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,890
- Then, do something.
Fine.

179
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,460
Watch.

180
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,410
Hey...

181
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,300
Karen...

182
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,230
Smooth! Yeah...

183
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:50,060
All I'm asking is that you do a minimal
amount of work in this class,

184
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,390
to give yourself the illusion
that you're actually learning something.

185
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,550
and to give me a metonymy self-respect

186
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,840
like I'm actually
teaching a class.

187
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:03,030
It's called sociology.
The study of society.

188
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,580
People, beside yourselves,

189
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:09,020
You're going to choose one of these
topics on the screen,

190
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,300
to be the subject of your
10-page research paper.

191
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,910
You should know that your 10-page research paper's
going to constitute 75% of your mid-term grade.

192
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,690
Oh yes, yes. I know, I know,
Lives have been ruined.

193
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,530
But you know what Mr. Miles
is gonna do for you?

194
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:30,360
I'm gonna assign you a partner. So, that you
learn to share responsibility.

195
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,210
To share the work load.

196
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,320
Ernesto, you're gonna work with Suzanne.
Nathan, meet Karen.

197
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:42,000
Gilly, you're gonna be working with Sean.
And let's see, Atzlob with Muhammad.

198
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,060
Romeo, Juliet.

199
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:12,360
- Hi, how are you? What a surprise.
How're you?

200
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:52,690
I'm doing all the work for you
on that research paper. You got that?

201
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,550
Got it.

202
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,760
You still like games.

203
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,920
When was the last time you're here?

204
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,540
When you had a bunk bed.

205
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,660
Wow?

206
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:17,680
Hey... You kids want something to eat and drink?
Or more pillows to sit on the floor?

207
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,320
Mom.

208
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,670
Okay.
You want the door open or closed?

209
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,830
Close it.
Please.

210
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,930
We should probably get to work.

211
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:44,070
It says here 2,300 Americans were
reported missing everyday.

212
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,000
I found a website
about missing kids here.

213
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:55,450
They have height, weights, age,
favorite foods...

214
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,380
Medical reports,
check it out.

215
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:07,580
Last place they were seen,
people they affliated with, everything.

216
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,190
I'll send you... this link.

217
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:26,630
What's that story I heard about you waking
up in your underwear on your lawn, after the party.

218
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,530
Just a practical joke.. Hmmm!
Not worth explaining.

219
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,970
And I had pants on, yeah.

220
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:49,170
I thought your boyfriend was gonna
take a swing at me that night.

221
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,920
He's not my boyfriend.

222
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:57,290
What you say to him, anyway,
to make him back out so quickly?

223
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,750
I told him that you'd kick him in his big fat head

224
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,900
and embarrass him
in front of everyone

225
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,060
if he didn't stop acting
like a dick.

226
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:08,490
- How'd you know I would have kicked him on the head?
How long have we lived across the street. Can you tell that, Nathan?

227
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,840
Hey, check this out.

228
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,100
What is it?

229
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,880
I found a site that shows few mock ups of
missing kids might look like today.

230
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,210
And if you recognize the person, you can click
on a child and text. Hmmm...

231
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,480
- Check out those guys!
Jason Statham meets,

232
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,780
Justin Bieber.

233
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,820
Seriously!
Next.

234
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,820
Ryan Seacrest meets...

235
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,890
Lady Gaga.

236
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,670
Next.

237
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,960
Matt Damon
meets...

238
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,150
you.

239
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,370
That doesn't look like me.

240
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:07,290
Nope, you're right. These stuff are not you.
This kid's too cute.

241
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,870
Send me a link to that site?
Yeah.

242
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,550
My uncle's coming to check up on me,
cause my folks are out of town.

243
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,940
When did you wanna start outlining?

244
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:33,820
How bout' I come over in an hour?
- Yeah yeah, awesome.

245
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,220
Bye.

246
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,350
Weird.

247
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,010
You put it on my food now.

248
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,100
Martin and Lorna Price.

249
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,310
Hey, what's going on?

250
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,060
- Hey, where do you think you're going?
What?

251
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,440
Come here.
Did you forget you were grounded?

252
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:33,020
Nathan, your mother said get over here.
Get over here!

253
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,100
What's up? You're going to Karen's?

254
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,800
-Yes. for a school project.
- What project?

255
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Some websites.
Can I go?

256
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,580
- You have to get it done tonight? Has to be finished?
Pretty much...

257
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,100
For school?
For school.

258
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,650
- It is for school, right?
-Right.

259
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,810
Still grounded... Okay.
but for school work.

260
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,200
- Okay.
- Okay. Be quick.

261
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:04,130
- Understood.
Be back for dinner.

262
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,600
Deal.

263
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,180
- Bye.
- And behave yourself.

264
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,000
Our little boy.

265
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,490
I can't believe we
still agreed to that.

266
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:23,370
Karen, I remember she's
just a child.

267
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,330
She's kinda hot now.

268
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,990
- She's sweet.
Sweet, yeah did I meant...

269
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,990
- And he's a good boy.
-Yeah.

270
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:35,200
Alright, I see the resemblance, but
I really don't think this is you, Nathan.

271
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,170
Okay, good.
Tell me why?

272
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:42,700
Well, first of all, this kid was like
3 and a half years old.

273
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,220
- I mean, do we all look the same at that age?
Yes.

274
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,990
- But we have the same exact chin.
- Coincidence.

275
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,790
Fine.

276
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,180
Explain this.

277
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,840
- Okay, it's a similar shirt.
- Not just the shirt,

278
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,290
The stain on the left shoulder.

279
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:09,930
Here. Look.

280
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,670
Holy Shit!

281
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,250
Online contact.

282
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:32,650
Steven Price.

283
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,200
My name is... Marisa.

284
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,200
Marisa?

285
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,600
<i> Hello, my name is Marisa. I'll be helping you
help in this case. What is your name? </ i ></i>

286
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:05,200
<i> Do you believe you've seen Steven Price? </ i ></i>

287
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:11,840
Possibly.
Can you tell me more?

288
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,100
<i> What is your location,
Mr. Harper? </ i ></i>

289
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I mean, I don't get it. Do you think it's weird
that she wants to know where your address is?

290
00:26:35,801 --> 00:26:39,500
<i>Why does it matter where you are now?
You could just be tipping him off...</i>

291
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:42,770
<i> It's really suspicious to me
that it doesn't feel right. < / i ></i>

292
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,500
<i>I think we should talk
with your parents. < / i ></i>

293
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,770
Mr. Kazlow, you wanted me to notify you
immediately if the website got a hit.

294
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:02,770
And if anyone ever finds out, then
you're gonna get into trouble,

295
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,820
Cause it's probably
a false accusation.

296
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,000
And then I gonna get into trouble
because now I am an accomplice.

297
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,500
Don't you think it's weird?

298
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:15,860
Maybe this is all just a mistake.

299
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,850
Well, you could be adopted.
You know, dropped at the doorstep,

300
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,590
You never know.

301
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:25,210
If I were adopted,
why would my picture

302
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,480
ended up on a
missing person's website?

303
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,270
Well,
a better question would be.

304
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:36,180
If this is for real, then who are
those people living in your house?

305
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:39,380
We're gonna be out there. We're gonna dive.
You still wanna dive with us, okay?

306
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,620
We need you to study, right?

307
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,430
Reading about the weather changes.

308
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,680
In times when your mother and I
are asleep,

309
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,060
You gotta take the helmet.
Our lives will be in your hands.

310
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,430
I'm not gonna make it sound too hard
on us, but it's dangerous out there.

311
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:53,680
The ocean is a big, scary beach,
man.

312
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,170
What you got there?

313
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,080
I lost my
driver's license.

314
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,850
I need this to get a new one.

315
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,630
That was really going on?
Yeah, what else would be going on?

316
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:25,280
- You're not getting fake ID?
No.

317
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,460
What's going on, man?

318
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,200
I don't know,
I must be losing my mind.

319
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,810
My parents are too boring
to be psychoes.

320
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,750
You never know, man?

321
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:40,790
Now, here's you
two years old...

322
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,560
three years, five...

323
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,410
Nice, nice.

324
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,040
Wooh wooh, wait a second.

325
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,590
You see this picture
of you when you were five?

326
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,960
Yeah, what?
It's cropped, weird.

327
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:01,050
The slight outline of the person shoulder,

328
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,690
Clearly zoomed in to the touch...

329
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:05,150
Like, someone didn't want
to be seen in the picture.

330
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,420
Anymore photographs of you
when you were younger?

331
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,500
Those are the ones that are questionable.

332
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:12,340
Not really, just some more of me by myself.

333
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:15,620
A few family photos is all
that you had from your childhood?

334
00:29:15,621 --> 00:29:16,681
Hmmm...

335
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,490
All that I can find.

336
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,430
Nathan, I got a million
embarrassing family photos.

337
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,180
Enough to make me wanna bomb it...

338
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,640
and you 're telling me all
you have is two?

339
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:47,480
Too cool to say hi now?

340
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,940
Hi

341
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,220
Teenagers.

342
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,540
Hi, bud.

343
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,090
What you looking at?

344
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:36,660
Your baby shirt.
- Are you my mother?

345
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:46,930
You are my son. You don't understand,
baby, it's complicated.

346
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:52,370
Answer me,
are you my mother?

347
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:59,210
No, Nathan, I'm not.

348
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:05,570
We wanted to tell you for so long,
and we just couldn't.

349
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,810
Go ahead, tell me.
All of it.

350
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:17,400
Kevin's part of this,
I gotta go.

351
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:24,500
See me, don't judge us so quickly,
alright? You don't know.

352
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,850
I love you. You're what it's
made as a family.

353
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:35,870
I love you and you are my son,
nothing's gonna change that.

354
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,910
Don't.

355
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,160
I'm so sorry.

356
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,900
Don't hate me, okay?

357
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:56,010
I'll get your dad.

358
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,260
Yeah?

359
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,020
- Hey, I heard you called up, so...
- Karen, it's true.

360
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,960
- My mom just admitted it.
What? God, Nathan,

361
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,830
you must be freaking out.
I'll be over in a minute.

362
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:22,050
Okay,
come in the back door.

363
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,420
- Miss Harper?
- Yes?

364
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:49,680
- How are you this evening?
Fine, thank you.

365
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,120
We're investigators from
the Bridgewater Juvenile Justice Department.

366
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:59,540
It's about your son, Nathan.
We have a couple of questions for him.

367
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,390
May we come in for a moment?

368
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,330
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

369
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,410
- Stay quiet.
-Kevin!

370
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:13,710
Where is he? Where is Nathan?
Tell us, where is he?

371
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:35,000
You get outta my sight!

372
00:33:48,001 --> 00:33:49,001
Who are you?

373
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,370
It has started. I'll get the kid.

374
00:34:49,001 --> 00:34:49,981
Mara...

375
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:08,970
Go, Nathan, go!
Go now!

376
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,590
No, son, run!
And don't stop.

377
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,560
Karen.

378
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:37,640
Hey! Get in the house.

379
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:49,760
I swear to God, you're gonna be fine.
You won't even feel a thing.

380
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,920
It's such a waste, you know that?

381
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,950
Hey!

382
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,010
Who are you?

383
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:41,640
Who are you?
Answer me!!! Answer me!

384
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,560
- Nathan, stop.
- You killed my parents!

385
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:48,810
Stop, stop. I'll tell you what you need to know.
But, I'm not dying here.

386
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,870
There's a bomb in the oven.

387
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,100
What?

388
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,650
Oh My God.

389
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:31,510
NON-US CITIZENS
STAY BEHIND THE LINE
WITH DOCUMENTS READY

390
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,300
Sir, you're next.

391
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:00,270
Thank you, sir,
Have a nice day.

392
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:06,260
- How bad is it?
I don't know, it hurts.

393
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,490
I'm taking you to the hospital.

394
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:33,720
We need a doctor.

395
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,890
Anybody? We need
a doctor, please?

396
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,960

My parents were just murdered and
I think the people who did it are after me too.

But my parents were killed at
2009, Clearwater Drive.

I'm shaking up a bit, but...
wait!

How did you know my name?

415

My name is Frank Burton.
I work for the CIA.

CIA?
Why am I talking to the CIA?

I need to know if you're okay.

418
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:12,360
Am I okay? I just saw my parents
get murdered in front of my eyes.

419
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:14,530
You've spoken to anyone

No.

Boss, Vassar Brothers Hospital,
it's about 10 minutes away.

431
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,310
One of the ER doctors will come
to check on you soon.

432
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:05,460
I want the video feeds from every
security camera in that hospital.

433
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:15,160
- Put this on.
What?

434
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,820
Dr. Bennett?
What are you doing here?

435
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,300
There is no time to explain, Nathan.
We gotta get out of here.

436
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,380
Put that on, walk behind me.
Cover your face from the cameras.

437
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,060
What do you have
to do with all these?

438
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:28,180
- I'm a friend of your father's.
- My father was just killed.

439
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:30,700
I'm talking about your real father.

440

- Wait.
What?

441
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:36,150
Karen.
- There's no time.

442
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,550
- I came for you, Nathan.
- I'm not leaving without her.

443
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,050
They're here already.

444

446
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,730
Hey.
Hi.

447
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:59,040
It's okay, she's my...
Doesn't matter, let's go.

448
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:00,320
Yeah.

449
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:02,290
I'm looking for these
two teenagers,

450
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:05,150
my nephew
and his girlfriend. They ran away.

451
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:09,950
Go, fast.

452
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,850
Faster.

453
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,450
Come on.

454
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:26,710
Nathan, take the exit!
Go left.

455
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,650
- We're in.
- Where are you, Nathan?

456
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:35,110
Where is it?
- Over here, Nathan.

457
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,460
I hate balloons.

458
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,230
We got a hit.

459
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:52,430
Get the visual on the target.
Garage, second floor.

460
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,840
Stop! Get him!
Shit!

461
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,160
<i>Target is fleeing west bound, < / i ></i>

462
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,830
<i>late model silver BMW.
We're in pursue.</i>

463
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,780
-Stay on them.
- Sir?

464
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,140
- What?
- Face rec got another hit.

465
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:08,200
You should take a look.

466
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:13,960
You can kiss your pension goodbye, Jerry.

467
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:19,010
Nathan, there'll be time for you to deal
emotionally with all of these,

468
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:21,480
but right now,
you have to get your shit together.

469
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:25,430
Who are you really?

470
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:28,210
Agent Brad, target is proceeding south.

471
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:31,380
I'm one of your keepers, Nathan.
I've put in place to look after you.

472
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:34,050
Just like Mara and Kevin were,
they died protecting you.

473
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:36,070
This is crazy,
call the police or something.

474
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:39,050
I already tried. I dialed
911 back at the hospital,

475
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:42,020
and some guy came on the line
and said he was with the CIA.

476
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:44,050
-Frank Burton.
Burton? I work for him.

477
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:45,880
What?
Or I did.

478
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,230
He can't be trusted. There were only
four of us who knew your identity.

479
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:52,310
Mara, Kevin, me and Burton,
two of us were dead.

480
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:56,750
Until I can get in touch with Martin,
we have to consider Burton unreliable.

481
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:01,310
<i>Target heading west
over the Fort Pit Bridge. < / i ></i>

482
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:07,900
Here, 4311 Clarendon Boulevard,
Apt. 2, Arlington, Virginia.

483
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,600
Memorise the address. What?
Find you way there and just sit tight until someone contacts you.

484
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:13,450
What? We're just supposed to
wait for someone?

485
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:16,420
It's an arrangement I made with your
father in case something like this ever happened.

486
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,170
Who is my father? Who are
my real parents?

487
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:20,710
She has heard too much already.

488
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,300
What?
- Are you serious?

489
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:24,770
As soon as you can,
dump those clothes.

490
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:28,190
Now less than 20 seconds, we're gonna hit
a soft curve,

491
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,480
just before the bridge, I'm gonna slow down
just enough for you to jump out.

492
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:33,640
-Jump?
- Their field division will be obscured.

493
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:36,850
It's 30ft down to the riverbank.
- Dr. Bennett, this is insane.

494
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:40,230
15 seconds. And, remember from now on,
do not trust anybody,

495
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:42,390
except Martin Price and Paul Rasmus.

496
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:45,350
I don't even know these people!
I need answers.

497
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:47,540
You've been looking for
answers your whole life,

498
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:50,300
you just didn't know what questions to ask.
You can do this, Nathan.

499
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,570
Now, you have 10 seconds
to open that door.

500
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,600
After you jump,
I'll create a diversion.

501
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,240
I don't, I don't know if I can handle this, Nathan.

502
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,790
5 seconds, leave the girl,
you're better off alone.

503
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:01,150
- Where am I supposed to go?
- Just trust me.

504
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:04,810
- Take a breath, it's gonna be okay.
- Jump! Now!

505
00:46:04,811 --> 00:46:05,751
You're ready?

506
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:08,120
Jump!

507
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:10,180
Get out of here!

508
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:15,770
One lousy state trooper.
That's all you can get?

509
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,640
<i>- Don't lose that kid.
- We're on it, Chief. < / i ></i>

510
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:26,090
Watch out!

511
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,400
Come on, let's go.

512
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:52,130
- Alright, we have to get into the river.
What? Why?

513
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,110
They're still trying to track us.
Right here.

514
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:59,480
Watch your feet.

515
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:16,110
Behind here.

516
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,990
Was Nathan Price in the vehicle?

517
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I want confirmation!

518
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:38,640
Okay, sit down.
Relax.

519
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:41,500
You stay right here.
I'm gonna be right back, okay?

520
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,530
Stay.

521
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:18,280
Hey!

522
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:21,360
Come on.

523
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:55,050
It's okay.
You were crying in your sleep?

524
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:07,720
- I was dreaming about...
I know.

525
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,970
You don't have to say it.

526
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:22,230
I have to get you home.

527
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:24,430
Nathan,
I can't go home.

528
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:26,070
You'll be safe there.

529
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:27,760
I won't be safe there.
We're not safe here.

530
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,400
We're not safe anywhere.

531
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:31,600
- Come, let's go.
- Whe're we gonna go now?

532
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,960
Just walk.
- I can't go back there, Nathan.

533
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:36,180
Don't you understand?
My parents are in Italy.

534
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,540
Even if they were home,
they can't protect me.

535
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:40,900
What do we suppose to do?
Call 911 again?

536
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:43,410
Look, whoever these people are,
whatever they want,

537
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:45,260
they're after me,
not you.

538
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:48,010
- I think they'll leave you alone.
- Do you really believe that?

539
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:50,580
Or you're thinking about what your
therapist said back in the car.

540
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:53,770
-Your chances are better alone.
No, of course not.

541
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:59,970
It's just, suddenly everyone around me
is dying, Karen.

542
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:02,030
And I don't want
anything happen to you.

543
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:04,410
We have to stick together, Nathan.

544
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:07,890
Who else we're gonna trust right now
except for each other.

545
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:14,050
Come on.

546
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:18,680
Alright,
here is the latest intel we have

547
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,940
about Martin Price's current mission.

548
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:22,800
10 days ago,
Martin Price

549
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,650
obtained a high value
piece of intel.

550
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:28,760
Specifically a list of
25 encrypted names.

551
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:32,090
US politicians
and intelligence officers

552
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:36,100
all of whom, have sold state secret
at one time or another.

553
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,650
the list was stolen from this man,
Nikola Kozlow.

554
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,680
Ex-Serbian secret service,

555
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,250
now freelance program operative.

556
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:46,720
He wants it back.
Badly.

557
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:48,660
Yesterday there was
an attack on the residence

558
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,820
where Martin's son,
Nathan lived.

559
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:53,090
Two of our
undercover agents were killed.

560
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,180
The attackers were
hired gunners...

561
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:58,880
Connections tracing them all the
way back to Nikola Kozlow.

562
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:02,060
Martin Price is the agency most
valuable black ops agent.

563
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:04,530
Keeping his son,
Nathan safe from Kozlow

564
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:06,080
is our top priority.

565
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:07,920
How did Kazlow
find Martin's son?

566
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:11,610
We think he discovered the
existence of the boy a couple of years ago

567
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:13,360
through a cyber attack.

568
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,310
He's been fishing ever since with

569
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,580
fake missing persons' websites.

570
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:20,040
One of his traps
finally worked.

571
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,940
Nathan Price
is the bargaining chip.

572
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,990
How so?

573
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:29,640
If Kozlow gets to
the kid before we do,

574
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:31,490
gets the list of Martin's.

575
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:33,960
What do I need to know
that you're not telling me?

576
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:37,290
The boy escaped from us
last night

577
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,350
with some help
from a veteran operative.

578
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:42,860
Jerry Bennett, her vehicle
was empty when we got there.

579
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,110
No sign of her,
no sign of the kid's.

580
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:47,270
Frank.

581
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:56,610
Get this situation under control,

582
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:59,190
before things
get any messier.

583
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:15,820
- Hey, can you take us to Virginia?
- Get in.

584
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:18,760
- It's quench time, Frank.
- Yup. Where the hell is Martin?

585
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:21,660
Last contact we had was the shabu drop,
two days ago.

586
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,850
He's vanished since then. The faster
he can make it back here...

587
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:27,520
is about 36 hours, which is how long
we got to find this kid.

588
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:28,290
Track the girl.

589
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:29,290
Track his friends.

590
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:31,550
Track anyone they've
ever spoken to.

591
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:34,740
Put up an alert to all
overseas stations.

592
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:36,580
Get a fix on Nikola Kozlow.

593
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:39,160
If they can't locate him,
that means he's probably already here.

594
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,400
So that we can add in to
our list of headaches as well.

595
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:45,410
Clarendon Avenue,
this is the street.

596
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:54,800
Hello?

597
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:16,160
" Lorna Price".
17937 Calvary Road

598
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:23,040
G 377.

599
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:29,380
- What is it?
- I know this woman.

600
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:34,390
Who is she?
- I think she's my mother.

601
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:42,130
This must be
of Martin Price's apartment.

602
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:53,430
I'm gonna call my uncle.
Let him know I'm still alive.

603
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:00,370
- Hello?
- Uncle Danny?

604
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,960
I'm sorry,
I must have dialed the wrong number.

605
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:09,020
- Karen? Karen Murphy, is that you?
Who is this?

606
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:11,600
<i>Someone who is trying
help you and Nathan. < / i ></i>

607
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,450
How do you know my name?

608
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:16,200
<i> You are in danger, Karen. < / i ></i>

609
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:20,140
<i>There are other people
trying to find you. < / i ></i>

610
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:23,680
Who is this?
- Nathan.

611
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:27,250
Listen to me, Nathan,
We're going to find you.

612
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:30,730
<i> You can't hide from us.
It's for your own safety. < / I ></i>

613
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:33,070
Let's go.

614
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,130
Kids.

615
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:42,860
Thanks.

616
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:14,780
This address
could be 15 years old.

617
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,560
You know the chances of finding
your mother living there?

618
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:21,150
I know.
But that's all we have.

619
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:36,950
This is an odd address.
Look at the numbering.

620
00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:40,880
"G 377"

621
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:44,550
That's her plot number.

622
00:58:08,330 --> 00:58:11,520
" Lorna Elizabeth Price"

623
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,700
You know what's messed up?

624
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:37,340
I never knew either
one of my mothers.

625
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:43,410
The one who raised me?
I had no clue who she really was.

626
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:46,590
what she sacrificed for me.

627
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:54,100
And Lorna Price, all she was
a face in my dream.

628
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:59,960
Now she has a name,
but she's still a dead end.

629
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:04,700
Nathan, maybe she's
not a dead end.

630
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,410
These flowers are fresh.

631
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:12,160
I'll handle this.

632
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,520
-Hello.
- Hi, how can I help you?

633
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:20,680
My brother and I just came
from visiting my mother's grave,

634
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:23,760
and we saw some flowers
have been left there recently.

635
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,660
Is there anyway you can check
and see who sent them?

636
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,960
We came a really long way
to visit her.

637
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:35,070
Couldn't you just help out
with this little favor?

638
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:41,240
- Okay, what's the name?
Lorna Price.

639
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:52,140
Okay, so the flowers
came from Omaha, Nebraska.

640
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,680
Mr. P. Rasmus.

641
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:56,870
Looks like,
it's gonna be a long sending order.

642
00:59:57,950 --> 00:59:59,300
Do you have an address for that?

643
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:05,610
Signal just got a hit
on the name, Lorna Price.

644
01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:08,990
It came from a computer,
a place called "Calvary Cemetery".

645
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:11,530
Calvary Cemetery.

646
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:15,380
The CIA is mobilizing
a strike team out of Pittsburgh.

647
01:00:15,551 --> 01:00:17,901
<i>Speaking in Serbian language...</i>

648
01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:20,980
Dr. Bennett said we could
trust Paul Rasmus.

649
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:23,550
- We have to find him.
-You wanna drive to Nebraska?

650
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,370
No, we're probably have
been with this car for too long already...

651
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:28,330
-We need to ditch it.
Well, what then?

652
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:30,000
We'll never even get
through the airport security.

653
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,990
- They know our names, our faces.
I know, I have another plan.

654
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:46,160
Hello?

655
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:55,550
Tuscarora Pike, Route 15.

656
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:57,720
<i> You are very close to it. < / i ></i>

657
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:23,830
Dude, these guys came to my house
asking questions,

658
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:26,500
I sneaked out back.
This is some deep deep shit.

659
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:28,070
Did you bring what I asked for?

660
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:30,430
Yeah. Three different IDs in
three different states.

661
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:31,770
- Yeah, that works.
- Karen,

662
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:33,730
I went through all
your facebook photos,

663
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:36,110
I chose the one of you from
that pep rally last month,

664
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:38,070
Cause I bet you look really
good in it.

665
01:01:38,170 --> 01:01:41,560
-I mean, I can use the one from the beach, if you want.
- These will be fine. Thanks, Gilly.

666
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:42,960
Cool.

667
01:01:43,350 --> 01:01:48,120
Let's move. We should get going now.
This isn't safe for any of us.

668
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:51,480
I'm sorry about your parents.

669
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:56,680
Listen, if there's anything else I can
do for you,

670
01:01:56,890 --> 01:02:00,180
- If you need cash or...
- We're okay.

671
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:03,660
See you, Gilly.

672
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:05,260
Thanks, man.

673
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:06,990
See you.

674
01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:20,270
-Target located.
Tell me where are they?

675
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,740
Step this way, please.

676
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:50,410
Thank you. Enjoy your trip.

677
01:03:02,510 --> 01:03:04,160
Move in.

678
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:15,030
Have a nice trip.

679
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:43,480
Good thing, it's only one night.

680
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,520
Do you remember that summer when...

681
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:01,010
our families were both
staying at the Canada Dona Lake?

682
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:04,290
After eighth grade,

683
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:09,630
In the boat house, we umm...
skipped the canoe trip?

684
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:17,200
Yeah, I remember.
Kinda.

685
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:21,680
Well, when we came back
to school that year,

686
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,730
How come you never ask me out?

687
01:04:23,870 --> 01:04:25,280
I don't know.

688
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,760
I just thought summer was summer?

689
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,320
And...

690
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:43,140
Are we gonna die, Nathan?

691
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:48,830
No.

692
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,850
I won't let that happen.

693
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:22,960
- Wow.
What?

694
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:26,300
It's better
than in middle school.

695
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:34,280
That's because I know
what I'm doing now.

696
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:44,590
And no breasts either.

697
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:27,350
We should get some... food?

698
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:30,530
-Yeah.
-Right.

699
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:33,140
I'm starving.

700
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:41,760
- I'll go.
- Okay.

701
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,560
I'll knock twice before came in.

702
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:52,110
Alright.

703
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:10,660
I'm on a train heading
south of the city.

704
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,190
Very good.

705
01:07:12,270 --> 01:07:14,800
<i>We're coming up at
Cincinnati Station.</i>

706
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:16,980
We'll be waiting at
the next stop.

707
01:07:19,890 --> 01:07:22,070
So hungry...

708
01:07:24,590 --> 01:07:26,730
He might like that.

709
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,710
Shut up!

710
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,600
Tell me what room is it?

711
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:20,360
Pretty fingers.

712
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:24,710
Tell me the room, now!

713
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:17,930
You wanna play somemore, huh?
You little man.

714
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:37,990
<i> Come on, Nathan. Use your anger,
think about it, keep control. < / i ></i>

715
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:48,260
<i> Come on, Nathan, do something.
You're gonna go down here. < / i ></i>

716
01:10:59,410 --> 01:11:01,000
<i> What can you do? < / i ></i>

717
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:05,810
<i> Focus,
think about it, think. < / i ></i>

718
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:08,170
<i> Think about it. < / i ></i>

719
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:31,750
Come on!

720
01:12:14,801 --> 01:12:16,001
Hey, hey!

721
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:31,760
Watch it.

722
01:12:36,010 --> 01:12:38,790
Hold on,
I need to catch a breath.

723
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:44,810
Okay.

724
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:10,220
He really is, Martin's
fucking kid.

725
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:19,310
They cannot get very far on foot.

726
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:22,590
Let's surround them up.
Wrap up this thing.

727
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:35,170
I didn't get it until now.

728
01:13:35,170 --> 01:13:38,860
All that time spent training,
wrestling, sparring...

729
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,120
He was preparing me...

730
01:13:42,310 --> 01:13:43,900
for this moment.

731
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:48,390
Two days ago, we are just
a couple of high school kids.

732
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:50,540
Now, it feels like a lifetime though.

733
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:52,180
Because it was.

734
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:08,600
<i> Agent Burton,
we have a visual on the target. < / I ></i>

735
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:10,650
<i>Going south on Route 51.< / i ></i>

736
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:17,830
<i> Alright,
get down here. < / i ></i>

737
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:18,401
Come on!

738
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:20,230
Kid!

739
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:22,550
Give it up, kid!

740
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:27,220
Nathan, Nathan!
Nathan!

741
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:30,850
Come on? Why are you running?

742
01:14:30,850 --> 01:14:35,050
Look around. Is anybody
pointing a gun at you?

743
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:37,100
We're not threatening you.

744
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:41,400
If you're really the CIA,
what's my real name?

745
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:42,740
Nathan Price.

746
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:47,040
Steven, Steven Price.

747
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:49,590
Steven's your middle name,
they argued about it,

748
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:51,250
but your mom thought Nathan was better.

749
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:53,570
- How do you know that?
- I was at the hospital,

750
01:14:53,570 --> 01:14:55,520
the night you were born,
Nathan.

751
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:59,360
- What do you want?
Well, I'd like to get outta this dirt for starters.

752
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:01,100
You kids have been
on the run for what?

753
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:03,250
22 hours?
Gotta be hungry.

754
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:07,450
How about I buy you a burger
and a milkshake?

755
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:24,660
You must've been hungry.

756
01:15:37,810 --> 01:15:40,860
Karen, can I have
some alone time with Nathan?

757
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:45,090
Agent Burns will
help you tend to those bruises.

758
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,910
Come, sit over here.

759
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:52,990
You must've a lot of questions.

760
01:15:54,410 --> 01:15:57,480
Who killed my parents?
You mean, Mara and Kevin?

761
01:15:57,930 --> 01:16:00,130
- Yes.
- His name is Nikola Kozlow,

762
01:16:00,130 --> 01:16:02,190
He's an independent black ops agent.

763
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,060
- Like my father?
Yes, but...

764
01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:09,320
Kozlow works
for the bad guys...

765
01:16:09,650 --> 01:16:13,130
Martin is... was one of us.

766
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:17,080
The woman you know
as Dr. Bennett, trained them, Lorna too.

767
01:16:18,650 --> 01:16:22,880
Whose idea was it
to put me in...

768
01:16:23,290 --> 01:16:26,570
foster care?
Or whatever you wanna call it.

769
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:29,230
When your mother died,
well, to be honest, we weren't sure

770
01:16:29,230 --> 01:16:31,280
whether Martin's gonna
crack or not.

771
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:34,770
He was in no condition
to raise a child. He realised that.

772
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:37,370
I told him that I would make
sure your were safe.

773
01:16:37,780 --> 01:16:40,240
So, Martin could carry on
doing what Martin does.

774
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:43,020
- What exactly is that?
- It's a messy world, Nathan.

775
01:16:43,230 --> 01:16:46,600
People like Martin and Kozlow
are just two sides of the same coin.

776
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:11,940
Listen, kid. The world
you've just dropped into...

777
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:14,500
is a world very few people get to see.

778
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,870
You're getting
a glimpse behind the curtain.

779
01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:19,630
What we're engaged in here
is a polite war.

780
01:17:19,630 --> 01:17:23,530
It's not about bullets and bombs,
borders or territories.

781
01:17:23,530 --> 01:17:26,510
The currency of this war
is information.

782
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:30,990
Zeros and ones, Nathan. Data,
and that's what Kozlow's after.

783
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,450
What is Kozlow
want from me?

784
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:39,780
Martin recently stole something
very valuable from Kozlow

785
01:17:39,790 --> 01:17:41,220
and he wants it back.

786
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:42,970
If Kozlow gets you,

787
01:17:42,970 --> 01:17:46,150
it put your father in a
very compromised position.

788
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:50,970
Why should my father suddenly
start caring about me now?

789
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:53,950
Nathan, you don't know
a first thing about your father.

790
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,380
I know it scares the shit out of you.

791
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:03,430
Myres, report?
Torres, report?

792
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,390
Torres, report?

793
01:18:13,270 --> 01:18:18,920
This thing that Kozlow wants so badly,
what my father stole, what is it?

794
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:23,120
It is a sequence of
meaningless numbers and letters.

795
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:26,200
It's actually an encrypted list
of 25 people

796
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:29,480
who have sold or traded
state secrets.

797
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:33,610
You have any idea how valuable
that kinda information is, Nathan?

798
01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:41,450
Your name's on that list, isn't it?

799
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:43,810
You have a vivid imagination.

800
01:18:44,230 --> 01:18:46,320
That's a very dangerous thing.

801
01:18:57,370 --> 01:18:59,540
Get down!
Stay down.

802
01:18:59,770 --> 01:19:01,920
Get behind something solid!

803
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:12,270
Stay here and keep
your heads down.

804
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:17,250
Stay down!

805
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:26,280
Come on.

806
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:40,290
Nathan?
Nathan?

807
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:52,200
What the hell is going on,
Nathan?

808
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:55,290
My parents murdered
and everything we've been through...

809
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:57,230
is all about a damn list.

810
01:19:57,310 --> 01:19:59,110
- What list?
- A list of names...

811
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:02,000
that my father stole. This guy,
Kozlow, came after me

812
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,670
thinking he'd force
my father to give it back.

813
01:20:05,770 --> 01:20:09,260
The crazy part is that I've had it all
along and I didn't even realize it.

814
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:12,030
It's in the phone I picked up
back at the apartment.

815
01:20:12,130 --> 01:20:15,110
Martin must've texted to himself
for safe keeping.

816
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:17,360
Jesus, Nathan.
Why didn't you give it to the CIA?

817
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:21,040
Because Dr. Bennett was right
about not trusting Burton.

818
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:23,300
We're on our own.

819
01:20:30,590 --> 01:20:34,130
- Where did you get that phone?
- The guy on the train who attacked us.

820
01:20:34,950 --> 01:20:36,460
Hello?

821
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:42,140
<i> Convenient thing about cellphone is
that can be turning into listening devices as well. < / i ></i>

822
01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:45,010
- Kozlow?
- You have something that belongs to me

823
01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:46,750
and now it's time to give it back.

824
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:49,770
<i>What use is it to you?
Don't be foolish, boy. < / I ></i>

825
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,820
Hand it over and you'll be left alone.

826
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:53,880
What kinda guarantee can you give me?

827
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:57,270
I can guarantee this:
If you don't surrender that list...

828
01:20:57,270 --> 01:20:59,630
I will be killing every friends you have,

829
01:20:59,630 --> 01:21:01,580
Zack, Gilly, neighbors.

830
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:03,530
even
your boring teacher.

831
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:06,300
And when I'm finished,
you'll be responsible for the death

832
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,870
of every friend
you have on facebook.

833
01:21:09,290 --> 01:21:11,880
But I think there is one
person in particular

834
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:14,960
you don't wanna see get hurt,
am i right, Nathan?

835
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:19,480
Her parents arrive on
Italy's flight 449 tomorrow afternoon

836
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:24,510
at 3.20pm. If I don't have the list
by then, they're dead.

837
01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:28,810
<i>You can tell her all about
what's it like to lose your parents. < / i ></i>

838
01:21:28,810 --> 01:21:30,760
The feeling you must know by now,

839
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:33,330
am I right, Nathan,
or am I right?

840
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:37,270
Okay, okay.
So how do you propose we do this?

841
01:21:37,370 --> 01:21:40,250
Simple.
I give you a time and a place.

842
01:21:40,250 --> 01:21:43,020
No,
I'll pick the time and place.

843
01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:46,200
Somewhere public.

844
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:56,150
Someone backtracked our signal!

845
01:21:57,201 --> 01:21:58,601
Let's go guys!

846
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:01,030
Speaking in Serbian language...

847
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:04,250
Don't move!

848
01:22:06,250 --> 01:22:07,520
Good.

849
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,600
I'm only sorry there weren't
more up in there.

850
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,830
Yes, Sir. Another thing.
What?

851
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:14,500
We found a digital record.
Nathan Harper has the list.

852
01:22:14,510 --> 01:22:15,650
No, no, no!

853
01:22:15,650 --> 01:22:18,300
He's on his way to meet
with Kozlow and hand it over.

854
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:18,990
Where?

855
01:22:39,570 --> 01:22:41,370
- Were you followed?
- I don't think so.

856
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,730
I took my 8-year old neighbor's car.

857
01:22:43,730 --> 01:22:45,200
Can't you tell there's
no one else in here?

858
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:46,610
Did you do what I ask?

859
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,950
- Did you?
- Yeah, man. Just like you said.

860
01:22:55,190 --> 01:22:58,190
Patio section,
VIP access only,

861
01:22:58,190 --> 01:23:00,240
it's under 23 D.

862
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:04,140
Thanks, man.

863
01:23:04,870 --> 01:23:06,310
Good luck.

864
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:09,700
I wish there was
another way.

865
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:12,090
So do I.

866
01:23:23,310 --> 01:23:26,010
I assure you I have
the situation under control.

867
01:23:26,220 --> 01:23:27,690
- You have the boy?
No.

868
01:23:27,690 --> 01:23:29,130
- You have the list?
No.

869
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:31,900
Then you don't have things
under control, Frank.

870
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:17,990
- Hello?
- Hello, Nathan.

871
01:24:19,410 --> 01:24:21,070
Who is this?
- It's me.

872
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:24,260
I need you to turn around
and walk out of that stadium now.

873
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,820
Martin?
You sure have grown.

874
01:24:26,910 --> 01:24:29,500
I know federal agents who couldn't handle
what you've been through

875
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:32,070
in the past 24 hours.

876
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:36,790
But you can't go in there.
Kozlow will take the list and he will kill you.

877
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:40,810
- Not if I kill him first.
- You're not ready for that.

878
01:24:41,350 --> 01:24:43,730
- I've made it this far, haven't I?
You don't need to do this.

879
01:24:43,730 --> 01:24:46,810
I'm on my way.
Just trust me, Nathan, and give me a chance.

880
01:24:46,830 --> 01:24:49,060
- You are 15 years behind.
- Nathan.

881
01:24:49,060 --> 01:24:52,440
This is not the time,
I'm done with that.

882
01:25:15,870 --> 01:25:18,790
- Nathan?
- Take the ticket at the foot of the statue.

883
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:14,380
Well?

884
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:19,190
Where is this kid?

885
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:59,680
-Burns, you have anything yet?
- Nothing yet, Frank.

886
01:27:01,030 --> 01:27:02,450
Where are you, kid?

887
01:27:02,890 --> 01:27:05,660
- Excuse me.
- Watch it, get up.

888
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:16,460
Popcorn?

889
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:24,780
I don't understand this game at all,
but I like popcorn.

890
01:27:26,530 --> 01:27:28,530
I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.

891
01:27:39,070 --> 01:27:42,840
What happened?
What did I miss?

892
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:49,540
You got my list?

893
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:53,030
How do I know you won't kill me
once I've given it to you?

894
01:27:53,110 --> 01:27:58,860
You don't trust me?
- You murdered my parents.

895
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:02,150
They weren't your real parents.

896
01:28:02,150 --> 01:28:05,740
I can tell you all about
your real parents, but...

897
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:11,720
I'm not so sure if you want to
know the truth.

898
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:16,100
What truth?

899
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:20,410
Martin Wallace, as they called, Last Five.

900
01:28:20,430 --> 01:28:22,010
which means
they have the authority

901
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:23,950
to break
the Geneva Convention,

902
01:28:24,050 --> 01:28:25,600
to kill women,
children,

903
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:28,370
whatever was necessary to
accomplish his mission.

904
01:28:28,730 --> 01:28:32,170
But your mother,
on the other hand, so loyal.

905
01:28:32,380 --> 01:28:34,130
She wouldn't give out
Martin's location

906
01:28:34,230 --> 01:28:37,920
even to save her own life.

907
01:28:40,660 --> 01:28:44,560
- You killed her.
- Wasn't my intention.

908
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:46,510
She was a stubborn woman.

909
01:28:49,820 --> 01:28:54,300
Do you remember, Nathan? You should.
You were there too.

910
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:58,100
Paris, 1995.
Nathan, think.

911
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:03,000
That's the funny thing the human mind,

912
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,280
I am trained to pay attention to details
from the hair on your neck,

913
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:10,890
to the location of every security
camera in this stadium.

914
01:29:10,900 --> 01:29:12,530
But in that hotel room,

915
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:17,150
I made one,
tiny colossal mistake.

916
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:20,380
I forgot to check under the bed.

917
01:29:21,770 --> 01:29:23,350
The bed.

918
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:34,430
Nathan.

919
01:30:12,510 --> 01:30:17,330
Is this what you're looking for?
Now you have to give what we've agreed upon, right?

920
01:30:17,670 --> 01:30:19,230
Nathan?

921
01:30:23,470 --> 01:30:25,500
Frank,
I have location on Nathan.

922
01:30:25,610 --> 01:30:27,210
Where is he?
The decks above the visitors' blocks.

923
01:30:27,220 --> 01:30:30,100
They're moving fast.

924
01:31:04,330 --> 01:31:06,080
Martin?
- You're alive, that's good.

925
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:08,340
- Where are you?
In a shop at the upper level.

926
01:31:08,850 --> 01:31:12,950
<i> Listen to me, I need you to lead him
outside to the south parking lot. < / I ></i>

927
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,800
If I do that, I'm dead.

928
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,850
<i>If you stay where you are,
you're dead for sure. < / i ></i>

929
01:31:16,850 --> 01:31:19,210
<i> Lead him outside.
Trust me. < / I ></i>

930
01:31:19,310 --> 01:31:20,310
Why should I?

931
01:31:21,330 --> 01:31:23,790
Because I'm here, son.

932
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:34,240
Come on, Martin.

933
01:32:42,930 --> 01:32:44,850
Nathan!

934
01:32:46,050 --> 01:32:47,550
Nathan!

935
01:32:50,010 --> 01:32:52,460
Stop or I'll shoot!

936
01:32:58,130 --> 01:32:59,950
It's over, Nathan.

937
01:33:00,370 --> 01:33:03,370
<i> Trust me, Nathan,
I'm here, son. < / i ></i>

938
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:08,070
You're not as good as your father,
Nathan.

939
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:11,010
You sure about that?

940
01:33:18,110 --> 01:33:19,620
Martin!

941
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:42,420
Nathan, I'll take that.

942
01:33:47,940 --> 01:33:50,370
Oh, you're just like your dad, huh?

943
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:52,160
Let's go.

944
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:03,630
I told you we have the situation
under control, Sir. I have it.

945
01:34:03,630 --> 01:34:06,090
- Good work, let me see it.
- It is still encrypted, Sir.

946
01:34:06,090 --> 01:34:08,150
That's alright.
- Let me get it to the lab

947
01:34:08,150 --> 01:34:10,450
and I'll make sure you have
the decrypted file on your desk

948
01:34:10,450 --> 01:34:13,250
- first thing in the morning.
- It's funny.

949
01:34:13,250 --> 01:34:15,530
Martin said that would be
the first sign.

950
01:34:15,530 --> 01:34:18,000
- You talked to Martin?
He said that you insist

951
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,250
on overseeing the decryption yourself

952
01:34:20,250 --> 01:34:23,000
to give you a chance to take
your name off the list.

953
01:34:25,180 --> 01:34:29,910
Come on, Frank, you got a long
debriefing ahead of us.

954
01:34:30,630 --> 01:34:35,010
Let him go.
He's family.

955
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,500
I'm sorry... for everything.

956
01:34:41,990 --> 01:34:44,500
- I'll see you soon.
Martin?

957
01:34:44,511 --> 01:34:45,021
Mmm hmm...

958
01:34:45,030 --> 01:34:47,490
Give the phone
to my kid, Frank.

959
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:55,120
He wants to speak to you.

960
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:01,070
You're very brave, Nathan.

961
01:35:01,370 --> 01:35:04,140
I'll handle things with Hudson.
You and Karen

962
01:35:04,140 --> 01:35:06,700
won't have to worry about
the agency from now on.

963
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:08,000
- Where are you?

964
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,151
I'm right here.

965
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:12,290
Watching from a distance,
like I always have.

966
01:35:12,660 --> 01:35:15,040
All I ever wanted
was to keep you safe,

967
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:18,930
make sure you didn't get hurt.
But, I failed.

968
01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:22,990
- I'm sorry, Nathan. Truly am.
- When can I see you?

969
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:26,140
Why don't you come out here
and talk to me in person?

970
01:35:26,140 --> 01:35:29,020
I'd like that,
more than you can imagine.

971
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:31,480
- But it's not possible.
- Why not?

972
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:33,730
I made certain choices
a long time ago.

973
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:37,420
I deliver the consequences of those choices,
but you don't have to.

974
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,220
Well then, it's up to me.
I wanna meet you.

975
01:35:41,220 --> 01:35:45,220
- You don't understand the risk.
- I don't care about the risks.

976
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:49,270
You remind me of your mother.

977
01:35:49,370 --> 01:35:51,420
Martin?

978
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:54,200
Dad?

979
01:35:56,201 --> 01:35:57,201
Nathan.

980
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:02,730
I'm your father,
but I'll never be your dad.

981
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:05,770
I lost that chance
long time ago.

982
01:36:05,770 --> 01:36:08,220
I don't know if you can
understand my reasons,

983
01:36:08,230 --> 01:36:09,870
maybe someday you will.

984
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:12,120
But you're the only family
I have left.

985
01:36:13,460 --> 01:36:14,890
You're leaving me all alone...

986
01:36:15,001 --> 01:36:16,801
You're gonna be alright.

987
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,550
Sorry, son.

988
01:36:21,700 --> 01:36:23,500
Goodbye, Nathan.

989
01:36:35,250 --> 01:36:37,410
Nathan.

990
01:37:04,010 --> 01:37:05,100
- Dr. Bennett?

991
01:37:05,701 --> 01:37:06,901
Hello Nathan.

992
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:08,650
Hi.

993
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:10,830
Call me Jerry.

994
01:37:11,401 --> 01:37:12,851
I can't believe you're alive.

995
01:37:12,890 --> 01:37:15,250
Me? What about you guys?

996
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:19,050
How are you dealing with all of these?

997
01:37:20,051 --> 01:37:21,000
You okay?

998
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:23,000
Yeah, I'm fine.

999
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:27,990
It's for your own protection.

1000
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:29,101
I know.

1001
01:37:31,010 --> 01:37:32,400
Where do I go from here?

1002
01:37:32,410 --> 01:37:34,660
Your father wanted me
to talk to you by making arrangements

1003
01:37:34,660 --> 01:37:36,720
for a new home.

1004
01:37:36,820 --> 01:37:38,890
Nothing can replace
Kevin and Mara.

1005
01:37:38,890 --> 01:37:40,220
I know that.

1006
01:37:40,230 --> 01:37:42,470
But we thought maybe you
would want to consider

1007
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:45,140
coming to live with me
until you finish high school.

1008
01:37:47,860 --> 01:37:49,620
Then, you have college and...

1009
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:53,000
you know, whatever else
you wanna pursue.

1010
01:37:53,981 --> 01:37:55,501
How does that sound?

1011
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:00,140
Yeah, sounds good.

1012
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:08,520
Okie-Dokie.
So... Should we get outta here?

1013
01:38:15,150 --> 01:38:16,450
Not quite yet.

1014
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:21,000
I'll make sure he gets home,
alright?

1015
01:38:21,421 --> 01:38:22,201
Oh...

1016
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:26,620
I see. Okay,
that's cool, I'll just... you know...

1017
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:28,770
I'll be here.
-All right.

1018
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:36,380
And Nathan, about a certain young lady,
I was wrong.

1019
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:40,070
You should hold on to her.

1020
01:38:40,970 --> 01:38:42,430
Yeah.

1021
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:45,830
She's worth it.

1022
01:38:55,340 --> 01:38:57,560
I'm sorry we missed the game.

1023
01:38:57,560 --> 01:38:59,720
You can take me to another one.

1024
01:39:02,260 --> 01:39:03,690
It's a date.

1025
01:39:04,030 --> 01:39:07,080
So...
you mean this isn't gonna be like eigth-grade

1026
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:10,150
after the boat house
between us?

1027
01:39:11,270 --> 01:39:13,820
You know what the problem was
back in eighth-grade?

1028
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:19,700
Just wasn't ready
for you yet.

1029
01:39:19,801 --> 01:39:20,751
Hmmm...

1030
01:39:20,770 --> 01:39:24,240
So, I had to wait four years
for you to ask me out?

1031
01:39:25,370 --> 01:39:26,910
Yeah..

1032
01:39:27,790 --> 01:39:29,440
But you gotta admit

1033
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:32,310
it's one pretty exciting
first date.

1034
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:35,590
Definitely.
