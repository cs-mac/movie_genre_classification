00:00:34,124 --> 00:00:35,342
Good!

3
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:46,303
Okay.
Beauty!

4
00:01:17,075 --> 00:01:19,191
Ease up, Walt.

5
00:01:24,388 --> 00:01:25,785
Fuck!   
Shit!

6
00:01:26,423 --> 00:01:27,468
Fucking mother.

7
00:01:27,492 --> 00:01:29,510
Get the rope! 
Up there!

8
00:01:29,991 --> 00:01:32,221
- How was the handball game today?
- We won.

9
00:01:32,246 --> 00:01:34,555
You always win, man.
Shit! I missed it again.

10
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,600
- You gotta get that pizza delivered.
- I gotta get to that game.

11
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:40,214
- Hey, Walt. How you doing?
- Hi, John.

12
00:01:42,851 --> 00:01:44,427
- Hey Walt
- Yeah.

13
00:01:44,452 --> 00:01:47,496
- Can I count on you for Thursday? What do you think?
- Yeah.

14
00:01:51,388 --> 00:01:54,868
This time motherfucker, you will die!
Raymond!

15
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:02,089
Good.

16
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:04,733
I gotta go.

17
00:02:05,835 --> 00:02:07,248
See you later.

18
00:02:12,975 --> 00:02:16,060
Hey, Doll.
I Love your hair.

19
00:02:17,535 --> 00:02:19,353
We're here!

20
00:02:23,795 --> 00:02:26,777
- Hey. What you got there?
- Love letters?

21
00:02:26,802 --> 00:02:29,293
Looks more like a "Dear John" letter to me

22
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:33,105
- Hey, everybody needs love, honey.
- All I need is a John!

23
00:02:33,245 --> 00:02:37,050
They are not girls. 
They are not boys.

24
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:41,136
They can't help it.
They was born like that.

25
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,839
Something in the throat.

26
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:49,859
Um hm...

27
00:03:00,815 --> 00:03:03,013
- Hey, Walt.
- Hey, Pogo. How you doing?

28
00:03:03,038 --> 00:03:05,376
- Not good.
- What happened?

29
00:03:05,401 --> 00:03:08,840
- Remember Ashley, my girlfriend?
- Yeah.

30
00:03:09,486 --> 00:03:11,976
She fucking left me, bro.

31
00:03:12,001 --> 00:03:14,988
- What do you want?
- She looked like she was 14.

32
00:03:17,042 --> 00:03:18,957
Bring it up higher.

33
00:03:33,872 --> 00:03:37,860
Hey! Hey! Shut the fucking window
or shut the fuck up!

34
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:41,067
- You shut your fucking window!
- Fucking faggots!

35
00:03:41,092 --> 00:03:44,027
The gay community thanks you
for your support, fucker!

36
00:03:44,052 --> 00:03:46,177
Fuck you and the gay community!

00:03:46,202 --> 00:03:51,257
Fuck you and your Let's get married, have kids and 
beat up the fucking dog community! Fucker!

38
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:03,598
Fucking demented fucking fruitcakes.

39
00:04:11,795 --> 00:04:16,630
Ah, shit! He's not in there, the little fuck.
Where the fuck is this motherfucker?

40
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:18,473
I told Mr. Z not to hire that fuck.

41
00:04:18,499 --> 00:04:21,344
I don't trust him! 
I never did!

42
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,766
You're looking sharp, Walt.

43
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:25,425
Save it for your paying customers, babe.

44
00:06:27,781 --> 00:06:30,238
- Hi.
- Hi, listen mama.

45
00:06:32,049 --> 00:06:34,361
- Okay.
- Thanks mama.

46
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:40,830
Hi, sweetheart. I was in bed last night
and I saw a rat run across my rug.

47
00:06:40,855 --> 00:06:43,460
No, I'm sure you're mistaken.

48
00:06:44,095 --> 00:06:46,312
You 're not listening to me.

49
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:50,973
I was in bed last night.
I saw a rat run across the rug.

50
00:06:51,006 --> 00:06:52,071
Okay?

51
00:06:52,096 --> 00:06:54,192
Rat? 
We have no rats here.

52
00:06:54,217 --> 00:06:59,837
Could you send Jaime, 
to check my apartment tomorrow, please?

53
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:02,204
I'm late for work.

00:07:15,531 --> 00:07:19,636
Come on, Amber.
Come here. Hurry up!

Alright. Who's from Brooklyn here?

Get your fucking hand off my shoulder.

73
00:09:36,421 --> 00:09:39,280
- I was trying to get your ass.
- Oh, my God. Are you gay?

74
00:09:39,369 --> 00:09:41,055
A little bit.

75
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,297
Only a little bit?

76
00:09:44,975 --> 00:09:48,442
And I'm a little bit of a girl, too, sweet heart.

77
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:52,660
You are a little bit, I'm all woman.
All right. I want you to bend over now.

78
00:09:54,395 --> 00:09:56,784
I want you to kiss my ass.

79
00:10:01,126 --> 00:10:05,531
Kiss my ass. Think of me
as a present and it's Christmas.

80
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,244
Alright.
Alright.

81

Have a seat. 
Look at you. Jesus Christ!

82
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:16,992
All right, honies, I'm gonna invite

You're a whore.

How many times I tell you?
I don't go with whores. You know...

00:15:44,892 --> 00:15:50,263
You've had a stroke. There is
some paralysis on your right side.

Mr. Koontz I’m Detective Noonan.

123
00:15:53,016 --> 00:15:56,150
In the early morning hours
of October 3rd, you heard gunshots.

124
00:15:56,175 --> 00:16:00,797
You took your service revolver and attempted to confront
the perpetrators before your heart attack?

125
00:16:00,822 --> 00:16:03,694
- Actually, a stroke.
- Right. Sorry.

126
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:06,806
Did you get a look at the killers?
Could you identify them?

127
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:17,304
You 're here for Amber Garcia Sanchez?

128
00:16:19,965 --> 00:16:22,455
I'm here to identify the body.

129
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,586
Uh huh. And your relationship
to the deceased?

130
00:16:27,367 --> 00:16:29,359
Just a friend.

131
00:16:31,548 --> 00:16:35,178
Son of a bitch. 
Stupid fuck! Where's the money?

140
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:20,555
All set, Mr. Koontz? I've arranged for
one of our volunteers to drive you home.

141
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,872
I'm going home alone.

142
00:17:23,153 --> 00:17:25,232
By yourself?

143
00:17:25,826 --> 00:17:27,443
Alone?

144
00:17:27,517 --> 00:17:30,110
- But why?
- I’m okay.

145
00:17:30,906 --> 00:17:33,195
To see if I can.

146
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:43,671
Hey, Pop. Jesus Christ!

149
00:17:48,813 --> 00:17:52,048
- You need a little help, Walt?
- No, I'm okay.

150
00:17:53,877 --> 00:17:56,403
I can't believe what happened to him.

151
00:18:01,097 --> 00:18:05,659
Waldo Koontz

152
00:18:05,955 --> 00:18:09,185
I... I had a stroke.

153
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,264
Oh? You think that's bad?

154
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:15,576
I didn't sleep a wink last night.

155
00:19:59,219 --> 00:20:01,249
Oh, God.

What the fuck did you do to my place?
You Neanderthals!

158
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,658
I'll fuck you up if we don't get our money.

159
00:20:12,683 --> 00:20:13,613
What money?

160
00:20:13,638 --> 00:20:16,268
The money Amber gave you to fucking hide.
Mother fucker.

161
00:20:16,293 --> 00:20:17,492
Honey, if I had any money.

162
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:21,246
I'd move to a better neighborhood where
I wouldn't have to deal with scum like you.

163
00:20:21,271 --> 00:20:23,500
Now see, bitch!

164
00:20:24,629 --> 00:20:27,975
You homicidal maniacs are so sensitive.

165
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,270
- What the fuck is this?
- No! Don't! Don't!

166
00:20:32,295 --> 00:20:34,515
- Don't!
- What is it?

167
00:20:35,387 --> 00:20:38,684
- What the fuck is this shit?
- It's Amber's ashes.

168
00:20:38,709 --> 00:20:41,296
Aw, shit! 
Aw, shit!

169
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:49,671
Get the fuck outta here!
Get the fuck outta here!

170
00:20:49,696 --> 00:20:54,036
- We'll be watching you, faggot.
- Oh, watch my ass! Watch my ass!

171
00:20:54,061 --> 00:20:55,957
Boom,
boom.

172
00:21:23,764 --> 00:21:25,811
Ashley.

173
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,662
Why did you trash me?

174
00:21:28,824 --> 00:21:32,904
Like some used-up soda can.

175
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,873
Ashley.

176
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:38,928
Why did you trash me?

177
00:21:39,078 --> 00:21:42,757
I was supposed to be your man.

178
00:21:43,748 --> 00:21:45,739
Ashley.

179
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,726
You 're a fucking bitch.

180
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:52,929
You left me for a guy named Lance.

181
00:21:53,127 --> 00:21:55,370
Ashley.

182
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:58,554
You 're really stupid.

183
00:21:58,648 --> 00:22:03,523
Cos I was saving up
to take you to France.

184
00:22:03,683 --> 00:22:07,414
Yeah, I was gonna take you to France.

185
00:22:16,177 --> 00:22:20,471
- Mr. Koontz?
- It's Dr. Nirmala.

186
00:22:20,781 --> 00:22:23,343
Are you in there?

187
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:36,650
Mr. Wilcox at the front desk
said you were in.

188
00:22:39,857 --> 00:22:43,842
- Hello, Mr. Koontz.
- Hello

189
00:22:43,867 --> 00:22:47,206
I've been,
so concerned, Mr. Koontz.

190
00:22:48,212 --> 00:22:52,006
You didn't return to the hospital
for your physical therapy.

191
00:22:52,031 --> 00:22:55,176
And you don't answer your telephone.

192
00:22:56,391 --> 00:22:59,313
And your friends say
that you never visit them

193
00:22:59,338 --> 00:23:02,221
and you don't allow them to visit you.

194
00:23:04,986 --> 00:23:11,498
And... And Mr. Pim, the grocer
he says that you shop once a week

195
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:14,180
and not till late at night.

196
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,528
Now, I can understand.

197
00:23:16,622 --> 00:23:21,435
You don't want your friends to see you
perhaps not as you once were.

198
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:26,440
But if you came in for your therapy
you would improve.

199
00:23:26,683 --> 00:23:29,599
and so would your spirits.

200
00:23:32,517 --> 00:23:38,051
I can arrange to have
a physical therapist come here

201
00:23:38,076 --> 00:23:40,919
3 times a week. Hm?

202
00:23:45,983 --> 00:23:48,312
Would you like that?

203
00:23:49,373 --> 00:23:50,725
Huh.

204
00:23:51,337 --> 00:23:55,869
Of course, it's going to be more
expensive than at the hospital.

205
00:23:59,078 --> 00:24:05,495
What else... What else
do I have to spend my... my money on?

206
00:24:11,294 --> 00:24:14,711
Ah, son of a bitch! 
It stinks!

207
00:24:14,756 --> 00:24:17,783
Let's keep our voices down.
Let's just keep our voices down.

208
00:24:17,808 --> 00:24:19,783
Shut the fuck up!

209
00:24:19,808 --> 00:24:23,305
- Crazy shit man.
- What the fuck are we talking about, keeping shit down?

210
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,381
Where's the fucking bitch at?

211
00:24:27,684 --> 00:24:30,666
That skanky whore has my money.

212
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,771
Oh, hi!

213
00:24:38,194 --> 00:24:41,882
Well...
Uh, how are you?

214
00:24:42,196 --> 00:24:45,199
No, I mean, I heard you got hurt
trying to save Amber.

215
00:24:45,224 --> 00:24:48,386
You know, and she was
a friend of mine, so I...

216
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,047
I really...

217
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:54,284
Well, I wanna thank you
and I'm sorry about...

218
00:24:54,455 --> 00:24:57,213
Oh, here. 
Let me help you, sweetheart.

219
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,871
Get away.

220
00:25:02,896 --> 00:25:05,351
Are you okay? 
Give me your hand?

221
00:25:09,095 --> 00:25:12,790
Oh, don't be like that... 
for God's sake.

222
00:25:14,182 --> 00:25:16,327
Are you worried I might be catchy?

223
00:25:16,352 --> 00:25:19,056
Or you might suffer
from a severe jewelry rash?

224
00:25:19,081 --> 00:25:20,869
Go fuck yourself.

225
00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:24,564
I've had worse... big boy.

226
00:25:34,085 --> 00:25:35,892
Look at her.

227
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:39,364
- Happy Halloween.
- You devil.

228
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:46,485
Are you registered to vote?
Republican?

229
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,856
That is just teetering on interesting.

230
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:53,766
Look, it's very simple.
You sign up for the Flawless contest.

231
00:25:53,791 --> 00:25:57,863
If we don't receive your entrance fee
within 2 weeks, you're eighty sixed.

232
00:25:57,888 --> 00:25:59,906
You know what?
You 're hideous!

233
00:25:59,931 --> 00:26:01,681
- Hi, ladies!
- Happy Halloween.

234
00:26:01,706 --> 00:26:02,367
Hi, sweetheart.

235
00:26:02,392 --> 00:26:05,346
Is it just me, or are drag queens
getting more demented every year?

236
00:26:05,371 --> 00:26:07,621
It's just you, honey.
It's you, hon. That's for sure.

237
00:26:07,646 --> 00:26:10,988
Honey, how come...
the goddamn entrance fee went up?

238
00:26:11,013 --> 00:26:13,502
- Cost of living, sweetie.
- A 100 fucking dollars!

239
00:26:13,527 --> 00:26:16,562
- My God. Whose living is that?
- Not that it matters.

240
00:26:16,587 --> 00:26:18,931
I think we all know who's going to win.

241
00:26:18,956 --> 00:26:21,174
My little Hispanic hotcake.

242
00:26:21,199 --> 00:26:23,650
You truly are flawless, Cha-Cha.

243
00:26:23,675 --> 00:26:27,586
She ain't gonna win this year. No fucking way!
You prehistoric fucking bitch!

244
00:26:27,611 --> 00:26:29,965
It's America's least wanted.

245
00:26:31,638 --> 00:26:36,148
Yeah. I heard your tired pussy was on sale
at the International House of Cunts!

246
00:26:36,173 --> 00:26:40,301
- Yeah, with your mama, bitch!
- Take it to the street, freaks!

247
00:26:41,259 --> 00:26:44,181
I need some butch faggots over here.

248
00:26:46,028 --> 00:26:47,681
I need some dykes!

249
00:26:48,931 --> 00:26:50,224
Fuck up!

250
00:26:50,249 --> 00:26:52,203
Get off of me.
Fuck!

251
00:26:52,228 --> 00:26:56,723
Get the fuck outta here! Shit!
That's right! You got thrown out again.

252
00:26:58,664 --> 00:27:01,913
Oh, hi. 
Is Walt...

253
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:04,171
- Could I...
- Yeah, come on.

254
00:27:04,196 --> 00:27:05,582
Thanks.

255
00:27:07,755 --> 00:27:11,667
Hey, buddy. 
I been trying to see you.

256
00:27:11,692 --> 00:27:14,598
You know how many times
I knocked on your door or rang your phone?

257
00:27:14,623 --> 00:27:17,449
I've been really worried.
I'm his physical therapist.

258
00:27:17,474 --> 00:27:21,020
- LeShaun Williams.
- Tommy Walsh. I’m on my lunch hour.

259
00:27:21,045 --> 00:27:24,234
- I thought I'd stop by.
- Sure.

260
00:27:27,591 --> 00:27:29,095
So...

261
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,518
Walt, how you doing?

262
00:27:34,226 --> 00:27:35,532
Hey...

263
00:27:36,517 --> 00:27:38,757
- What's your name?
- LeShaun.

264
00:27:38,851 --> 00:27:43,569
Listen, you take good care of my buddy
here, huh? He's a real hero, you know.

265
00:27:43,594 --> 00:27:48,727
He saved me, the other guard, Joe
and 14 hostages in 1988.

266
00:27:50,278 --> 00:27:52,380
Tom... 
Wait, wait.

267
00:27:52,405 --> 00:27:56,449
That’s how he won early retirement.
Look here. A letter from Mayor Koch.

268
00:27:56,493 --> 00:27:59,404
- Wow.
- There's a bravery medal.

269
00:27:59,494 --> 00:28:02,201
- Man.
- Tommy, please.

270
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:04,079
Look at this.

271
00:28:04,165 --> 00:28:07,074
This is Walt, right here
 in the middle.

272
00:28:07,167 --> 00:28:09,244
That's Joe. 
That's me.

273
00:28:10,417 --> 00:28:14,941
I'm pistol whipped down on the floor.
Joe's shitting in his pants.

274
00:28:14,966 --> 00:28:19,128
And Walt, pistol whipped also
bleeding like a mother.

275
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:21,819
He pretends like he's knocked out.

276
00:28:22,011 --> 00:28:24,602
All of a sudden, 
blam blam!

277
00:28:24,764 --> 00:28:28,498
He shoots.
Two thieving motherfuckers go down.

278
00:28:31,594 --> 00:28:34,181
You want us to tell 'em to shut up?

279
00:28:34,233 --> 00:28:37,318
- Hey, shut the fuck up!
- Oh, girls. Look, a man in uniform!

280
00:28:37,343 --> 00:28:38,997
- Officer, help me!
- Holy shit!

281
00:28:39,022 --> 00:28:40,461
Break.
Break.

282
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:42,875
Jesus Christ!

283
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:47,742
- You make me feel.
- *You make me feel.

284
00:28:47,787 --> 00:28:49,779
Fucking freak show!

285
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:55,241
Well...
Maybe I should go.

286
00:28:56,753 --> 00:28:59,670
- Walt. You uh...
- Here we go. That's right.

287
00:28:59,756 --> 00:29:03,704
- You need anything?
- I'm okay.

288
00:29:04,134 --> 00:29:07,468
I guess you heard that Amber
that little hooker upstairs

289
00:29:07,493 --> 00:29:10,924
and her sleaze boyfriend stole off Mr. Z.

290
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:14,796
So it was his guys and him
that you were shooting at.

291
00:29:14,852 --> 00:29:18,788
They still can't find the money.
And you know the cops can't do anything.

292
00:29:18,813 --> 00:29:23,077
Mr. Z's got 'em in his pocket. 
Anyways.

293
00:29:23,132 --> 00:29:24,665
Hey, do me a favor, will you?

294
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:26,877
Pick up the goddamn phone
when I call you.

295
00:29:26,911 --> 00:29:29,314
- And take good care of him.
- Yeah.

296
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:31,925
- What was your name again?
- LeShaun.

297
00:29:31,987 --> 00:29:35,211
- Right. Right.
- Yeah. All right.

298
00:29:35,298 --> 00:29:37,108
I'll see you.

299
00:29:38,226 --> 00:29:40,365
Take it easy, 
Walt.

300
00:29:43,753 --> 00:29:48,440
You know, I had some real success with...
stroke patients improving speech.

301
00:29:48,465 --> 00:29:50,196
- You know how?
- Uh-uh.

302
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:51,575
Don't laugh.

303
00:29:51,607 --> 00:29:55,793
Singing lessons. It relaxes you.
A lot of people like singing.

304
00:29:55,818 --> 00:29:58,648
I got a card in my bag for a lady uptown.

305
00:29:58,906 --> 00:30:02,071
Mildred something. 
She's good.

306
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:06,267
You gotta start getting out soon, anyway.
What could you lose?

307
00:30:06,321 --> 00:30:09,537
You start talking better and visit 
with your friends on the phone.

308
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,934
You could even have phone sex.

309
00:30:13,998 --> 00:30:20,151
Call us. Call us now.
Hot, wild girls waiting by the phone.

310
00:30:20,176 --> 00:30:22,698
We're hot and wild and willing.

311
00:30:22,723 --> 00:30:26,121
The girl of your dreams
is waiting by the phone.

312
00:30:26,146 --> 00:30:29,681
She'll make your fantasies come true.

313
00:30:29,709 --> 00:30:31,785
Just call.

314
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:33,923
Pick up the phone.

315
00:30:33,948 --> 00:30:36,785
Reach out to have this...

316
00:30:51,345 --> 00:30:54,612
Hey buddy, you okay? 
I didn't hit you, did I?

317
00:30:54,661 --> 00:30:57,225
Hey. He slipped on the ice.
That's what happened.

318
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,805
Mr. Koontz, please, 
let me help you.

319
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,542
You okay?
Yeah?

320
00:31:03,925 --> 00:31:05,905
Buddy, is this yours?

321
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:08,234
Hey, you dropped something.

322
00:31:08,565 --> 00:31:11,282
I'll go get the door. 
I'll go get the door.

323
00:31:12,075 --> 00:31:15,920
Hey. You want this?
Is this your card? I think it is.

324
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,753
Hello honey, let me guess.
A Jehovah's Witness?

325
00:31:26,778 --> 00:31:32,542
I... I was wondering... 
if I could... pay you...

326
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:35,322
pay you for... singing lessons.

327
00:31:39,396 --> 00:31:43,892
I'm sorry. 
I'd rather suck Hitler's dead dick.

328
00:31:45,368 --> 00:31:47,972
I'm sure you did!

329
00:31:51,846 --> 00:31:54,507
Fucking faggot.

330
00:31:58,288 --> 00:32:00,291
Wait a minute. Wait.
Wait.

331
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:02,784
Fuck...

332
00:32:06,712 --> 00:32:09,182
Honey, could you pay cash?
Cash?

333
00:32:09,207 --> 00:32:11,599
I don't want your pity.

334
00:32:11,632 --> 00:32:16,364
I don't want your fucking pity either
all right? I need the money.

335
00:32:18,763 --> 00:32:22,079
I'll call you from the window
tomorrow when I'm ready.

336
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,688
We're wasting our time out here today.

337
00:32:32,026 --> 00:32:34,460
Fucking bitch! 
Hey, bitch!

338
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:36,963
Bitch! Where the fuck is Cristal?
Where the fuck is Cristal?

339
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:38,676
- I see. I see her! Right there!
- Shit!

340
00:32:38,701 --> 00:32:40,269
Yeah.
Yeah.

341
00:32:41,532 --> 00:32:43,569
Wait a minute, motherfucker!

342
00:32:45,716 --> 00:32:47,403
Fucking bitch.

343
00:32:51,632 --> 00:32:53,747
- No! My leg, it's hurt bad.
- Where the fuck is that bitch?

344
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:55,786
What do you want from me?

345
00:32:56,463 --> 00:32:58,691
- What do you want?
- Shut up!

346
00:32:58,716 --> 00:33:01,693
- Mr. Z's fucking money.
- No, I swear I know nothing!

347
00:33:01,725 --> 00:33:03,057
I don't know nothing!

348
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:05,125
Then why the fuck you disappear?
And make like Carl Lewis.

349
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:09,090
'Cos I heard you was looking for me and
I've seen what you've done to Amber and Raymond.

350
00:33:09,115 --> 00:33:12,931
Yes. And the same thing happens to you
if Mr. Z don't get his fucking money!

351
00:33:12,956 --> 00:33:15,737
Do I look like I got any money?
You think I'd be working 10th?

352
00:33:15,762 --> 00:33:18,410
- If you're lying, you fuckbag...
- Stop! I'm not!

353
00:33:18,435 --> 00:33:19,868
- Boom! Boom!
- No, no!

354
00:33:19,893 --> 00:33:21,639
No, stop it...

355
00:33:23,022 --> 00:33:25,914
What!?
Stop it!

356
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,289
Can you give me some money? 
Fuck!

357
00:33:29,326 --> 00:33:32,873
Give me some money, 
you fucking dicks!

358
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,608
Welcome to fairyland.

359
00:33:36,832 --> 00:33:38,991
We hope you enjoy the ride.

360
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:42,485
Do not stand up in the cars
and please...

361
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:46,357
... leave your attitude outside, all right?

362
00:33:46,715 --> 00:33:49,965
Honey, that was a joke.
Okay?

363
00:33:50,511 --> 00:33:53,894
I hate people who think they're funny.

364
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,538
Yeah? Bet you hate a lot of things.

365
00:34:01,729 --> 00:34:03,488
All right.

366
00:34:03,731 --> 00:34:06,758
Well, I... I thought
we'd start with the scales.

367
00:34:06,783 --> 00:34:09,367
Alright.
Do you know the scales?

368
00:34:10,289 --> 00:34:12,701
Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do...

369
00:34:12,726 --> 00:34:15,726
All right?
Grumpy, Sneezy and Horny.

370
00:34:15,751 --> 00:34:17,634
Ha-ha-ha...

371
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:20,244
All right.
Shall we begin?

372
00:34:21,764 --> 00:34:23,727
Do...

373
00:34:23,868 --> 00:34:26,454
Do...

374
00:34:26,508 --> 00:34:27,658
One more time.

375
00:34:28,368 --> 00:34:32,032
- Do...
- Do...

376
00:34:32,172 --> 00:34:33,385
Let's move on.

377
00:34:34,361 --> 00:34:37,398
- Re...
- Re...

378
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:40,070
Re...
Oh honey, I can't hear you.

379
00:34:40,095 --> 00:34:43,760
I am not Jodie Foster and this is not
"Silence of the Lambs". Alright.

380
00:34:43,785 --> 00:34:46,436
Now, your voice is a
muscle, all right?

381
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:49,353
And you can exercise it, okay.

382
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:54,019
What? You can exercise it.
Don't be afraid. All right.

383
00:34:55,202 --> 00:34:58,991
- Re...
- Re...

384
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:02,088
Re... Okay, that's better.
All right, let's move on.

385
00:35:03,175 --> 00:35:05,636
Me...

386
00:35:05,836 --> 00:35:07,702
- ... Me...
- Me..

387
00:35:07,727 --> 00:35:10,430
You see that. That's better.
That was a lot better.

388
00:35:10,455 --> 00:35:12,345
Okay, good.
Going for Fa.

389
00:35:13,552 --> 00:35:16,302
Fa...

390
00:35:20,901 --> 00:35:22,970
Fa, come on.
You can do it.

391
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,597
Fa...

392
00:35:26,887 --> 00:35:29,175
Sing out, Louise!

393
00:35:31,074 --> 00:35:34,450
- Fa...
- No, no. This is bullshit.

394
00:35:34,475 --> 00:35:38,081
Here's the... Here, I'll pay you.
Here's the... Here's the...

395
00:35:38,106 --> 00:35:41,192
- Hey, this was your idea.
- Bad idea.

396
00:35:41,217 --> 00:35:44,536
I can't do it.
Bullshit.

397
00:35:45,069 --> 00:35:48,940
Can't do it. 
Can't do this.

398
00:35:48,965 --> 00:35:53,170
Honey, "can't" lives on "won't" street.
All right.

399
00:35:53,703 --> 00:35:57,903
Why don't you try fucking faggot?

400
00:35:58,283 --> 00:36:02,634
You know, cos you were always pretty
good at shouting that across the alley.

401
00:36:03,053 --> 00:36:04,968
Fucking faggot.

402
00:36:05,155 --> 00:36:06,475
Prick.

403
00:36:06,588 --> 00:36:08,982
- Cocksucker.
- Asshole.

404
00:36:09,007 --> 00:36:11,735
- Girlie man.
- Yeah, Republican.

405
00:36:11,863 --> 00:36:13,187
Queer!

406
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,200
Fascist!

407
00:36:16,816 --> 00:36:17,956
Freak!

408
00:36:17,981 --> 00:36:19,883
Cheerleader fucker!

409
00:36:20,017 --> 00:36:22,241
Fucking fruitcake.

410
00:36:22,266 --> 00:36:23,112
Nazi!

411
00:36:23,137 --> 00:36:27,414
- What's with the fucking door?
- I'll fucking help you out of the door.

412
00:36:27,439 --> 00:36:30,845
- Fucking faggot!
- There you go.

413
00:36:32,236 --> 00:36:34,297
There, it's open.
There you go.

414
00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:36,720
If you came here with
a bellyful of self pity.

415
00:36:36,745 --> 00:36:39,060
- You came to the wrong fucking place.
- Fucking face.

416
00:36:39,117 --> 00:36:43,016
I left sensitivity back in the sand pile.

417
00:37:08,308 --> 00:37:10,003
All right, girl.

418
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:17,129
Michelle Pfeiffer goes
after a dangerous mind.

419
00:37:29,452 --> 00:37:31,493
I know you're in there.

420
00:37:31,518 --> 00:37:34,534
You paid for the lesson.
You might as well get it.

421
00:37:35,009 --> 00:37:37,643
Come on. 
Open the door.

422
00:37:37,794 --> 00:37:40,729
Walt, I want you, baby!

423
00:37:40,754 --> 00:37:46,485
Oh, Walt, please be my man!
Oh, please put it inside of me!

424
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:50,811
Break it off in me, daddy.
Break it off in me.

425
00:37:55,851 --> 00:37:59,369
- What the fuck's the matter with you?
- Okay, okay.

426
00:37:59,394 --> 00:38:02,949
- What the fuck you doing?
- All right, we had a few words.

427
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:05,472
None that we haven't heard
or used before. Alright.

428
00:38:05,497 --> 00:38:07,198
What. So is that it?
You just quit?

429
00:38:07,223 --> 00:38:09,195
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you, too.

430
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,060
Fuck you!

431
00:38:11,948 --> 00:38:15,764
- Having no trouble with the F sound?
- Get out!

432
00:38:15,789 --> 00:38:17,382
- Get out!
- Fine, fine.

433
00:38:17,407 --> 00:38:18,586
- I told your doctor.
- Fucking faggot.

434
00:38:18,611 --> 00:38:21,602
I told...
I told your doctor it will never work.

435
00:38:22,248 --> 00:38:26,860
- You. You talked to Dr... Dr. Nirmala?
- Yeah.

436
00:38:26,885 --> 00:38:28,787
- Nirmala?
- Yeah.

437
00:38:28,812 --> 00:38:30,239
And she's a very fine woman.

438
00:38:30,264 --> 00:38:33,697
She helped a friend of mine
who died of AlDS. Miss Burma.

439
00:38:33,722 --> 00:38:35,456
And also, if I was gonna teach you.

440
00:38:35,481 --> 00:38:38,218
I wanted to make sure I was doing it right.
You know.

441
00:38:38,247 --> 00:38:42,341
Like Anne Bancroft, you know.
The Miracle Worker.

442
00:38:42,366 --> 00:38:45,998
I don't need no fag 
with a heart of gold.

443
00:38:46,071 --> 00:38:48,369
Honey, you see a crown of thorns
on my head?

444
00:38:48,394 --> 00:38:51,700
Only rhinestones, sweetheart.
I am no Brother Teresa.

445
00:38:51,725 --> 00:38:55,165
I told you, I need the money.
I got big plans.

446
00:38:56,589 --> 00:38:58,272
Oh!

447
00:38:58,364 --> 00:39:01,040
Got a letter from Ed Koch.

448
00:39:01,065 --> 00:39:03,093
Ah, when New York was fun.

449
00:39:03,118 --> 00:39:05,788
Oh! 
You're a bowler.

450
00:39:05,871 --> 00:39:08,655
That's so cute.

451
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,740
Third place. 
Pretty good.

452
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:16,588
Oh, I always heard
you were some kind of hero. You know.

453
00:39:17,338 --> 00:39:20,841
Yeah.
Look where it got me.

454
00:39:21,677 --> 00:39:24,292
Oh, hey. 
You know?

455
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:28,779
You got a rough break.
Who didn't?

456
00:39:30,108 --> 00:39:35,379
Look, I see you sitting there all alone
you know, all the time. Yeah.

457
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:37,907
Hiding from life, you know.

458
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,427
Life. 
Life is shit.

459
00:39:40,452 --> 00:39:43,774
Aren't you just a little ray of sunshine.

460
00:39:43,906 --> 00:39:49,403
Oh, please allow me to leave you sitting all alone on
your pity pot, cos I've been there before, sweetheart.

461
00:39:49,622 --> 00:39:53,771
Poor me, poor me
pour me another, all right?

462
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,148
Okay.

463
00:39:59,305 --> 00:40:02,277
Oh, honey, are you coming upstairs?

464
00:40:02,504 --> 00:40:07,455
You know, to face the music
like the man you're supposed to be?

465
00:40:07,926 --> 00:40:12,752
Or should I just get Dr Kevorkian's
fucking phone number for you?

466
00:40:16,741 --> 00:40:18,323
Do.

467
00:40:18,522 --> 00:40:20,006
Re.

468
00:40:20,241 --> 00:40:21,370
Me.

469
00:40:21,395 --> 00:40:23,161
Your favorite note.

470
00:40:23,592 --> 00:40:25,263
Fa.

471
00:40:25,842 --> 00:40:27,398
So.

472
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,212
La.

473
00:40:29,667 --> 00:40:31,229
Ti

474
00:40:31,628 --> 00:40:32,816
Do.

475
00:40:32,841 --> 00:40:36,723
Oh, that was so adorable.

476
00:40:36,748 --> 00:40:40,700
All right, play that funky music, white boy.
Alright.

477
00:40:40,725 --> 00:40:44,140
Okay. I think you're doing pretty good
with the scales. Alright.

478
00:40:44,165 --> 00:40:47,236
We need to start working on a song, okay?

479
00:40:47,668 --> 00:40:49,562
All right.

480
00:40:49,587 --> 00:40:52,575
Oh, listen.
Everything's Coming Up Roses? Alright.

481
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,888
Peppy, positive, Sondheim.

482
00:40:54,913 --> 00:40:58,957
No? Okay, okay.
Moving right along.

483
00:40:58,982 --> 00:41:01,497
Probably you 're into Sinatra.

484
00:41:01,522 --> 00:41:06,909
Although I don't do Sinatra. Although
I'm sure I'm the only girl who hasn't. You know.

485
00:41:06,934 --> 00:41:10,038
I... I like the tango.

486
00:41:10,116 --> 00:41:14,268
So... you're a tango dancer?

487
00:41:14,386 --> 00:41:18,261
- Are you?
- Was. Was.

488
00:41:18,389 --> 00:41:20,144
Yeah.

489
00:41:20,546 --> 00:41:23,397
You will be again.
I know it.

490
00:41:24,826 --> 00:41:29,013
I know a song you'd probably love.
All right, hold on.

491
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:31,442
It's right here in the basket.
Okay.

492
00:41:33,065 --> 00:41:34,907
That's your favorite color.

493
00:41:35,813 --> 00:41:36,874
Oh dear.

494
00:41:36,899 --> 00:41:38,687
- Wow.
- Uu...

495
00:41:39,142 --> 00:41:42,191
- Sorry, girl.
- Uu... We didn't know you was entertaining.

496
00:41:42,216 --> 00:41:44,943
We're going downstairs for some pizza.

497
00:41:44,968 --> 00:41:50,234
Yeah. We were gonna go watch Carmine twirl
that pizza dough with his big muscles of his.

498
00:41:50,259 --> 00:41:51,387
You wanna come with us?

499
00:41:51,412 --> 00:41:53,159
Ladies um...

500
00:41:53,184 --> 00:41:58,497
This is Walt from downstairs. All right.
He's taking singing lessons. All right.

501
00:41:58,522 --> 00:42:01,585
Well, Mary, I just wanna find out
about my blue dress.

502
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:02,446
Alright.

503
00:42:02,471 --> 00:42:05,932
- I'm sorry. This will only take 1 minute.
- Try this on.

504
00:42:06,612 --> 00:42:10,997
You better watch out for Rusty, honey.
She likes you "straight" guys.

505
00:42:11,022 --> 00:42:13,886
Heh you!
Miss shh... shh... shh...

506
00:42:13,911 --> 00:42:17,860
Miss Thing, shove a land mine
in that big hole you call a mouth. Alright.

507
00:42:17,885 --> 00:42:21,838
How you doing, baby? My name is
Cha Cha de los Santos Pérez Cueva.

508
00:42:21,863 --> 00:42:22,657
Oh my god.

509
00:42:22,682 --> 00:42:24,965
You can just call me Cha-Cha.

510
00:42:25,622 --> 00:42:29,357
Oh, I'm sorry. You have
a "My Left Foot thing" going on, don't you?

511
00:42:29,382 --> 00:42:32,109
All right, out, out, out!
Out!

512
00:42:32,134 --> 00:42:35,142
- Girl. God, I think we got the message! Come on!
- Out.

513
00:42:35,167 --> 00:42:37,843
Yoo-hoo, Miss Taco Bell.
Vámonos. Vámonos. (Let's go. Let's go)

514
00:42:37,868 --> 00:42:40,838
- Bye, Mr. "My Left Foot."
- Vámonos. Vámonos. (Let's go. Let's go)

515
00:42:40,863 --> 00:42:42,814
- All right, I'll take a bite off. Alright.
- Chill.

516
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:44,707
Miss you already!

517
00:42:46,349 --> 00:42:49,872
Sorry about that. 
They are so much work.

518
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:55,165
All right.
Oh, Is this the real you or what?

519
00:42:55,905 --> 00:42:58,940
Give me some men
who are stout hearted men

520
00:42:58,965 --> 00:43:02,428
Who will fight for the right they adore

521
00:43:02,453 --> 00:43:05,239
Ooh, macho man!

522
00:43:05,264 --> 00:43:09,059
The macho man! 
I kill bear! Shit in woods!

523
00:43:09,084 --> 00:43:12,487
Am I right? You'll love it, honey.

524
00:43:12,545 --> 00:43:16,706
All right. Now, we can start with.
"Give me some men who are stout men."

525
00:43:16,731 --> 00:43:19,917
You know. From the top of that song
I thought would be really good.

526
00:43:19,942 --> 00:43:23,585
How long you been... doing this?

527
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:24,801
Singing?

528
00:43:24,826 --> 00:43:28,566
No, no. 
This drag queen type of thing.

529
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:34,616
Well, I've been in musicals
at school, ever since I was a little kid.

530
00:43:34,641 --> 00:43:39,715
You know, I was Prince Chulalongkorn
in ''The King And I.

531
00:43:39,832 --> 00:43:42,311
But I was miscast, um...

532
00:43:42,366 --> 00:43:44,810
Then I was the lion
in 'The Wizard of Oz'.

533
00:43:44,835 --> 00:43:48,549
And I was definitely miscast
but I was the only one uh...

534
00:43:49,207 --> 00:43:53,441
You know, fat enough
to fit into the costume. Whatever.

535
00:43:53,466 --> 00:43:58,369
And then in ''The Snow Queen
I was again totally miscast as the king.

536
00:43:58,394 --> 00:44:00,767
We were all on stage

537
00:44:00,792 --> 00:44:05,047
and they had made these dry ice kettles
so smoke could come out of 'em.

538
00:44:05,333 --> 00:44:10,208
And one night, all of a sudden
one dry ice kettle exploded

539
00:44:10,233 --> 00:44:13,738
And dry ice flew everywhere.
Alright.

540
00:44:13,763 --> 00:44:18,326
Well, pretty little Miss 'No Talent'
who was playing the snow queen, um...

541
00:44:18,351 --> 00:44:21,885
You know. Dashed off the stage screaming
and pulling her hair out.

542
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:24,699
Well, the play must go on,
I believe.

543
00:44:24,724 --> 00:44:27,249
And she had dropped her crown.

544
00:44:27,274 --> 00:44:30,876
Well, honey, 
I just picked up that crown

545
00:44:31,565 --> 00:44:33,765
put it on my head

546
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:39,101
And I was the greatest
goddamn snow queen

547
00:44:39,195 --> 00:44:42,943
In the history of PS 11
Paramus, New Jersey.

548
00:44:43,078 --> 00:44:46,432
And uh...
I have been wearing dresses ever since.

549
00:44:47,912 --> 00:44:51,011
But I don't like
the term "drag queen", you know?

550
00:44:51,036 --> 00:44:55,147
Because most drag queens just
wanna parade around looking flawless. You know.

551
00:44:55,172 --> 00:44:59,668
And if they sing, they lip synch 
to records and um...

552
00:45:01,919 --> 00:45:04,551
I'm a singer um...

553
00:45:04,984 --> 00:45:07,785
and I'm a female impressionist.

554
00:45:08,109 --> 00:45:10,421
I'm an artist, you know?

555
00:45:11,865 --> 00:45:15,609
Who do you think
you're bull... bullshitting?

556
00:45:15,633 --> 00:45:19,480
You're... a fucking drag queen!

557
00:45:25,527 --> 00:45:29,049
Let me um... savor those lovely words
for a moment, all right?

558
00:45:29,074 --> 00:45:31,982
What are you, channeling Jesse Helms?

559
00:45:32,007 --> 00:45:35,775
Don't be so... so sensitive.

560
00:45:36,165 --> 00:45:41,455
If... you can take a dick.
You can take an insult.

561
00:45:42,588 --> 00:45:44,579
Right, Walt.

562
00:45:44,754 --> 00:45:51,092
I'm not so... stupid as you think.

563
00:45:51,301 --> 00:45:56,212
Honey, you could never be as stupid
as I think you are, all right?

564
00:46:18,116 --> 00:46:21,288
- Yes?
- I owe you two weeks, right?

565
00:46:22,808 --> 00:46:24,053
Yes.

566
00:46:25,529 --> 00:46:28,039
And there's a week in advance.

567
00:46:28,961 --> 00:46:30,165
I'm getting a motorcycle.

568
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:33,117
I want to know if I could park it in the back
so it won't get ripped off.

569
00:46:33,142 --> 00:46:34,725
A motorcycle.

570
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:38,524
It's $50 additional every week for parking.

571
00:46:39,486 --> 00:46:41,727
- $50?
- Uh huh.

572
00:46:41,845 --> 00:46:43,359
No problem.

573
00:46:44,431 --> 00:46:47,799
- Take it easy.
- Would you like a receipt for that?

574
00:46:47,851 --> 00:46:51,562
No, I trust you. Why don't you
lighten up a little bit, Leonard.

575
00:46:51,587 --> 00:46:54,030
- Cone on, Tasha.
- Bye

576
00:46:54,055 --> 00:46:56,046
Have a nice evening.

577
00:47:17,381 --> 00:47:18,768
I don't know any other way.

578
00:47:18,793 --> 00:47:24,399
Don't push me! Don't push me!
Please don't push me! Just go!

579
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:28,109
- Don't call my fucking house! Jesus!
- Wait! Wait!

580
00:47:28,134 --> 00:47:30,936
- Fuck you. No. Don't fucking call me.
- Wait!

581
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:34,894
- I don't even care.
- I'm so sorry.

582
00:47:38,491 --> 00:47:40,475
You know that.
You are a fucking airhead.

583
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:44,834
Fuck man, I’m sorry!
Please stay!

584
00:47:44,859 --> 00:47:46,850
Please!

585
00:47:57,796 --> 00:48:01,980
- We're gonna start with "Shirley, Shirley".
- Last night.

586
00:48:02,444 --> 00:48:04,806
- What, honey?
- Your boyfriend?

587
00:48:06,248 --> 00:48:07,688
Yeah.

588
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:12,276
It's complicated.

589
00:48:12,301 --> 00:48:16,537
He's married.
He has two kids.

590
00:48:17,235 --> 00:48:20,033
But he fucking gambles

591
00:48:20,308 --> 00:48:21,884
You know?

592
00:48:22,881 --> 00:48:24,873
On sports.

593
00:48:25,516 --> 00:48:29,682
He always needs money for new storm
windows or something for his kids

594
00:48:29,707 --> 00:48:33,242
so he says, but it's for gambling 
and I know and it

595
00:48:37,321 --> 00:48:40,666
He... gambles with your money?

596
00:48:41,576 --> 00:48:44,246
Yeah, he gambles with my money

597
00:48:45,388 --> 00:48:49,756
So you pay... for sex?

598
00:48:51,868 --> 00:48:56,219
Oh honey, there's no romance
without finance, you know?

599
00:48:56,296 --> 00:48:59,746
I'm... I don't pay for sex.

600
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:02,753
- No?
- Uh-uh.

601
00:49:03,104 --> 00:49:04,854
Well...

602
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:06,381
Wh... What.

603
00:49:06,406 --> 00:49:10,163
You think if you got a wifey or a girlfriend,
you don't pay, honey?

604
00:49:10,188 --> 00:49:12,862
Honey, you pay,
all right?

605
00:49:13,197 --> 00:49:16,497
Alright. You ever been married?
Don't answer that.

606
00:49:16,522 --> 00:49:21,183
She probably died of some horrible
disease and it's made you what you are.

607
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:25,560
Well, she was a... a dancer.

608
00:49:25,746 --> 00:49:27,856
I worships her.

609
00:49:30,243 --> 00:49:35,244
She ran... ran off with some guy who...

610
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:41,698
gave her a... a tattoo.

611
00:49:44,905 --> 00:49:47,784
Took everything.
Everything...

612
00:49:48,273 --> 00:49:52,208
The dog.
Everything.

613
00:49:55,977 --> 00:49:59,218
Honey, you should have
gotten another dog.

614
00:49:59,995 --> 00:50:01,606
All right.

615
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:04,770
All right, slowly now.

616
00:50:05,816 --> 00:50:07,653
Shirley.

617
00:50:07,678 --> 00:50:09,239
Shirley.

618
00:50:09,264 --> 00:50:10,771
- Shirley.
- Shirley.

619
00:50:10,796 --> 00:50:11,928
Alright.

620
00:50:12,794 --> 00:50:15,466
Oh, Christ.
I'm sorry.

621
00:50:15,491 --> 00:50:18,139
Just Shirley, Shirley. Alright.

622
00:50:18,164 --> 00:50:19,440
- Just practice it.
- Alright.

623
00:50:19,465 --> 00:50:22,096
Okay, Okay! Okay!

624
00:50:22,121 --> 00:50:24,152
Stop ringing.

625
00:50:27,084 --> 00:50:30,868
What?
What?

626
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:38,040
When?

627
00:50:39,466 --> 00:50:40,803
Oh.

628
00:50:43,932 --> 00:50:46,447
Oh, hold on.
Hold on.

629
00:50:47,618 --> 00:50:49,399
Um...

630
00:50:52,899 --> 00:50:55,733
We're gonna just stop for today.
Alright, sweetheart.

631
00:50:55,758 --> 00:50:59,203
I'm sorry.
I just have to stop.

632
00:51:11,081 --> 00:51:12,845
Hello?

633
00:51:14,406 --> 00:51:16,601
Hello?

634
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:19,162
Who is this?

635
00:51:20,089 --> 00:51:23,113
- Walt.
- Walt.

636
00:51:23,592 --> 00:51:27,969
- Is there anything you need?
- To tell you the truth, I was... I...

637
00:51:27,994 --> 00:51:30,944
I was hoping later we would get together.

638
00:51:30,969 --> 00:51:33,340
Sure. 
You're a godsend.

639
00:51:33,365 --> 00:51:35,912
Because I’m...

640
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:41,379
having trouble with my rent...
again this month.

641
00:51:44,944 --> 00:51:48,816
Look.
To tell you the truth, I'm...

642
00:51:49,991 --> 00:51:53,462
I'm kind of tapped out.
I don't have any money

643
00:51:53,487 --> 00:51:57,549
except for the... the therapy.

644
00:51:57,574 --> 00:51:59,703
I see.

645
00:51:59,729 --> 00:52:06,024
- But we could still... still get together.
- Oh, sure.

646
00:52:06,049 --> 00:52:11,128
How about some... some time
next... next week?

647
00:52:11,802 --> 00:52:17,495
Listen, I’m gong to be tied up
for the next couple of weeks.

648
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,435
But I'll call you.

649
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,865
I gotta go.
Okay. Bye.

650
00:52:22,894 --> 00:52:24,462
- Bye, sweetie.
- Sure. Okay.

651
00:52:24,487 --> 00:52:27,064
- I'll call you. Bye.
- Okay.

652
00:52:41,996 --> 00:52:48,579
Don't go, cos she ain't interested in you
or what picture you wanna see.

653
00:52:48,863 --> 00:52:52,056
- Mr. Pogo has returned.
- She's just wasn't...

654
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:58,364
Where you going?
I haven't finished my story.

655
00:53:02,458 --> 00:53:04,759
- Nice wheels.
- Thanks, man.

656
00:53:04,784 --> 00:53:07,616
- Yeah, it must have cost you.
- Yeah.

657
00:53:07,641 --> 00:53:09,174
- Where'd you get the money?
- Hey?

658
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:12,069
- Hey.
- Aye.  Uh.

659
00:53:12,104 --> 00:53:13,345
What the fuck, man.

660
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:16,959
We hear you've been flashing around a lot of new cash.
Where did you get it?

661
00:53:16,984 --> 00:53:18,848
Look. Some guy owed me money.
Big deal.

662
00:53:18,873 --> 00:53:21,045
What fucking guy, huh?
What guy?

663
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:23,265
Look, fuck this shit.
Tasha, we gotta get out of here.

664
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:24,839
- Don't.
- Aw.

665
00:53:28,364 --> 00:53:29,633
Aw,
shit!

666
00:53:29,658 --> 00:53:32,612
Come here.
I'm fucking the bitch. I'm fucking the bitch.

667
00:53:32,637 --> 00:53:35,707
I'll tell you.
Don't hurt the bike.

668
00:53:35,732 --> 00:53:37,440
I been dealing.

669
00:53:38,793 --> 00:53:42,177
Dealing?
For who, motherfucker?

670
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,550
Reido.

671
00:53:46,759 --> 00:53:49,904
For that fat fuck?
In Mr. Z's territory?

672
00:53:49,929 --> 00:53:51,358
Fucker!

673
00:53:53,289 --> 00:53:56,462
Fucking...
fucker.

674
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:02,711
Oh, shit!

675
00:54:05,484 --> 00:54:09,011
You deal around here again
you're fucking dead!

676
00:54:12,615 --> 00:54:15,676
You never said nothing
about dealing drugs!

677
00:54:15,701 --> 00:54:17,253
Prick!

678
00:54:24,584 --> 00:54:26,211
Tasha.

679
00:54:27,387 --> 00:54:29,791
I really thought you were the one.

680
00:54:30,978 --> 00:54:34,604
You just treated me like scum.

681
00:54:35,635 --> 00:54:39,712
And you left me like a tornado
leaves a town.

682
00:54:41,682 --> 00:54:43,722
I gave you love.

683
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:45,856
I gave you gifts.

684
00:54:46,436 --> 00:54:49,000
Bu t you treated me like shit.

685
00:54:49,606 --> 00:54:52,977
And you fucking kicked me
when I was down.

686
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,484
You fucking kicked me
when I was down.

687
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:03,175
So no more excuses, alright.
When I call, just answer the phone.

688
00:55:03,201 --> 00:55:06,451
- Cos I know you talked to Karen.
- She told you?

689
00:55:06,476 --> 00:55:08,863
- No.
- Tia.

690
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:11,744
You know. The young one in the dance club
who had eyes for you?

691
00:55:11,769 --> 00:55:13,660
Tia's a whore, Tommy.

692
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:17,266
Hey. They're all whores.
Except my mother, may she rest in peace.

693
00:55:17,291 --> 00:55:18,880
Hey, watch it.

694
00:55:18,909 --> 00:55:23,556
Hey, and your mother too...
What's your name again?

695
00:55:24,345 --> 00:55:27,595
- LeShaun.
- LeShaun. Right.

696
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:30,338
Anyways, tomorrow's Saturday

697
00:55:30,363 --> 00:55:32,734
And the card game's at Vinnie's.

698
00:55:32,768 --> 00:55:37,600
The guys would sure love it
if you would drop by, like old times.

699
00:55:38,149 --> 00:55:39,879
Maybe.

700
00:55:40,523 --> 00:55:43,390
Yeah, sure.
And black is beautiful.

701
00:55:43,415 --> 00:55:46,023
Man, watch your mouth, all right?
Fat boy

702
00:55:46,055 --> 00:55:47,399
Fat boy?

703
00:55:48,407 --> 00:55:50,638
- Oh, you motherfucker!
- What's wrong with that?

704
00:55:50,663 --> 00:55:51,721
Oh... now watch it.

705
00:55:51,746 --> 00:55:53,720
No, I'm watching you.
You wanna come over here and watch?

706
00:55:53,745 --> 00:55:57,323
Don't be mad at me just cos
you look like Pillsbury Doughboy.

707
00:55:57,708 --> 00:56:00,374
I am somebody.

708
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:02,670
- Oh, no. Hold on.
- No. come on.

709
00:56:02,695 --> 00:56:04,996
-  Walt. Hand me the paddle, man. Hand me the peddle.
- Take it easy.

710
00:56:05,036 --> 00:56:08,021
- Get that fucking paddle before you come over, 
   I'll tell you that. 
- Yeah, you better watch out man.

711
00:56:08,046 --> 00:56:11,674
Hey, come on! I said it to you on purpose!
I know, you came from Kings.

712
00:56:11,699 --> 00:56:14,072
I saw "Roots". 
All 20 nights of it.

713
00:56:14,097 --> 00:56:16,865
Hey, you're making me miss 'em,
Tommy. Come on!

714
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:18,159
Okay.

715
00:56:18,184 --> 00:56:19,774
I got it.

716
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,387
There we go.

717
00:56:23,272 --> 00:56:24,931
- Hey.
- Hi. Is Walt there?

718
00:56:24,956 --> 00:56:27,015
- Yeah, he's here.
- Thanks.

719
00:56:28,943 --> 00:56:32,100
Don't cry for me, Argentina.

720
00:56:33,489 --> 00:56:37,848
What do you think, Mr "My Left Foot"?
You know, for the Flawless contest?

721
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:42,013
- I don't know.
- Oh, your brain's still broke, huh?

722
00:56:42,038 --> 00:56:43,856
Well, that's okay.

723
00:56:45,313 --> 00:56:49,991
Have you seen Miss Rusty?
Cos she was supposed to help me with this.

724
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:54,465
- No, I haven't seen him.
- Okay. Thank you.

725
00:56:54,901 --> 00:56:57,538
- Bye, baby.
- Bye.

726
00:56:59,361 --> 00:57:02,547
Bye,
big boy.

727
00:57:07,588 --> 00:57:09,745
- He gone?
- Un-huh

728
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:13,521
I don't wanna hear one fucking word
from either one of you.

729
00:57:14,739 --> 00:57:17,528
Okay... baby.

730
00:57:21,561 --> 00:57:23,851
Okay... baby.

731
00:57:24,819 --> 00:57:26,196
Here.

732
00:57:27,578 --> 00:57:31,802
Oh, oh my God. I'm so glad
I lived long enough to see that.

733
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:33,883
Baby.

734
00:57:49,221 --> 00:57:52,043
Get up, girl.

735
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:59,135
Like Lana Turner in Ziegfeld Girl.

736
00:58:04,052 --> 00:58:06,664
Oh, honey.

737
00:58:06,695 --> 00:58:09,387
Oh, honey.

738
00:58:15,203 --> 00:58:17,196
Hi.

739
00:58:18,177 --> 00:58:22,060
- Are you all right?
- Oh, peachy, honey.

740
00:58:22,085 --> 00:58:25,223
- Where the hell you been?
- Oh, fun and games.

741
00:58:25,248 --> 00:58:28,478
My mother’s funeral and wake.

742
00:58:28,503 --> 00:58:31,122
Oh, oh.
Sorry to hear about your mother.

743
00:58:31,147 --> 00:58:34,361
Oh, my father killed her a long time ago.

744
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:37,422
Buried her today, that's all.

745
00:58:37,825 --> 00:58:40,158
This is my legacy...

746
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:43,976
Her old gloves.
She always wore gloves.

747
00:58:44,001 --> 00:58:47,421
Yeah, she was a victim, you know?

748
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:52,366
But she was sweet
you know, but a victim.

749
00:58:53,319 --> 00:58:55,505
A reformed drunk...

750
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:58,799
on her knees at church, begging

751
00:58:58,824 --> 00:59:03,345
you know, Jesus, Mary and Joseph
and every goddamn saint in heaven

752
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:09,784
to forgive her for giving birth
to Cruella de Fag, you know.

753
00:59:10,196 --> 00:59:13,333
Being a slave to my father before he died.

754
00:59:13,358 --> 00:59:15,643
You would have loved each other.

755
00:59:16,578 --> 00:59:17,858
He uh...

756
00:59:17,883 --> 00:59:21,504
He thought Archie Bunker
was a flaming liberal.

757
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:29,660
You know, every morning
she would get up and fix him breakfast.

758
00:59:29,685 --> 00:59:34,747
And... every morning, 
for 30 years

759
00:59:34,772 --> 00:59:36,931
She said

760
00:59:36,956 --> 00:59:40,039
Hi, Daddy.
Do you love me?

761
00:59:40,777 --> 00:59:42,770
No answer.

762
00:59:44,031 --> 00:59:50,189
Every morning, 30 years.
Hi, Daddy. Do you love me? No answer.

763
00:59:50,214 --> 00:59:55,666
One day, my ma says
Hi, Daddy. Do you love me?

764
00:59:55,749 --> 00:59:57,590
And...

765
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:00,690
He said no.

766
01:00:08,106 --> 01:00:11,428
The moral of that story is so...

767
01:00:12,263 --> 01:00:17,560
If you haven't gotten an answer in
30 years, you ought to know it by now.

768
01:00:22,439 --> 01:00:25,274
- Thanks for the drink.
- You're welcome.

769
01:00:25,299 --> 01:00:29,545
See you tomorrow.
Thank you for staying.

770
01:00:29,570 --> 01:00:33,990
Sor... Sorry about your mother.
Thanks.

771
01:00:34,238 --> 01:00:36,401
You 're right, Walt.

772
01:00:37,744 --> 01:00:40,782
Honey, I just want you
to know that you're a...

773
01:00:40,807 --> 01:00:42,864
You know, 
I’m...

774
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:49,521
I'm not an artist, you know.
I'm not some... female impressionist.

775
01:00:49,546 --> 01:00:51,301
I'm a...

776
01:00:53,189 --> 01:00:56,116
I'm lonely...

777
01:00:57,477 --> 01:00:59,629
and I'm ugly...

778
01:01:00,307 --> 01:01:02,461
and I'm a drag queen.

779
01:01:05,959 --> 01:01:09,165
Now look who's feeling
sorry for themselves.

780
01:01:12,233 --> 01:01:14,439
- Where the fuck have you been?
- Sonny, don't.

781
01:01:14,464 --> 01:01:18,109
You says if I come here last night
You'll have the rest of the fucking money

782
01:01:18,134 --> 01:01:19,540
- Honey. Not now! Honey.
- And I showed up!

783
01:01:19,565 --> 01:01:21,284
I didn't have the money! 
I was somewhere else! Alright.

784
01:01:21,309 --> 01:01:23,337
Well. Where's the fucking money?
Give me the fucking money.

785
01:01:23,369 --> 01:01:25,251
- Go and get em.
- Come on, man. Take it easy, huh pal.

786
01:01:25,276 --> 01:01:26,131
Who the fuck is this?

787
01:01:26,156 --> 01:01:28,306
- Sonny! Let go! I'll get you the money.
- Get my money.

788
01:01:28,331 --> 01:01:30,534
Let go of him. I'll give you the money. Alright.
- Get me the money.

789
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:31,973
- Walt, just get in the room.
- Get the money.

790
01:01:31,998 --> 01:01:33,969
Walt.
He's not gonna let you go, alright!

791
01:01:33,994 --> 01:01:35,376
Just walk in the room!

792
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:37,181
- I'm tired of coming here for nothing.
- 5 minutes.

793
01:01:37,206 --> 01:01:39,455
5 minutes. 
Okay?

794
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:40,530
Did you fuck around?

795
01:01:40,555 --> 01:01:42,670
- I'm telling you, Rusty. I'm gonna fucking smack you.
- You look good, you.

796
01:01:42,695 --> 01:01:46,103
You look really good today, 
all right?

797
01:01:46,162 --> 01:01:48,155
All right, honey.

798
01:01:49,642 --> 01:01:51,896
Fuck you, you cocksucker!

799
01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:55,436
Don't. Don't you fucking lock this door!
Motherfucker!

800
01:01:55,468 --> 01:01:57,568
Don't you lock that door!

801
01:01:57,608 --> 01:02:00,228
- No! Not the fucking door again!
- Oh god...

802
01:02:00,276 --> 01:02:03,145
Rusty! You wanna fuck around.
Let's fuck around.

803
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,571
Oh!

804
01:02:05,854 --> 01:02:09,116
Come on. Open the fucking door!
I need that money, man!

805
01:02:09,141 --> 01:02:12,347
Steel plate.
Don't worry.

806
01:02:12,651 --> 01:02:17,529
I don't know if I did it to keep out burglars or Sonny,
when he gets like this.

807
01:02:18,207 --> 01:02:22,502
Go home and beat up wifey
before I call the cops, you fucker!

808
01:02:22,527 --> 01:02:24,976
All right, fuck you, fuck you.
You just fucked up.

809
01:02:25,008 --> 01:02:27,318
I'm coming back.
I'm coming every fucking night.

810
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:32,043
You don't pay me, I'll take a fucking scissor
to every fucking wig you got in here!

811
01:02:39,264 --> 01:02:41,061
Motherfucker!

812
01:02:41,985 --> 01:02:45,459
So that's your...
your boyfriend?

813
01:02:45,648 --> 01:02:47,801
He's not always like this.

814
01:02:49,818 --> 01:02:52,568
He's got this Italian Catholic...

815
01:02:52,603 --> 01:02:55,950
guilt and shame thing
because he loves me so much.

816
01:02:55,975 --> 01:02:58,400
We're... we're working it out.

817
01:02:58,701 --> 01:03:01,616
This won't happen once I uh...

818
01:03:01,651 --> 01:03:06,027
have my operation to be all woman,
you know.

819
01:03:07,209 --> 01:03:12,364
That's why I work teaching and sewing
saving up for the day that I...

820
01:03:13,229 --> 01:03:15,137
become a real woman.

821
01:03:15,162 --> 01:03:18,820
You 're gonna become
one of those he-she freaks?

822
01:03:18,845 --> 01:03:20,837
All she.

823
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:23,756
After the...

824
01:03:24,766 --> 01:03:28,324
hormone shots and the operation.

825
01:03:31,939 --> 01:03:34,625
You're gonna cut off
your dick and balls?

826
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:38,420
Snip, snip, sweetheart.

827
01:03:38,445 --> 01:03:42,964
How could a man cut off his dick
and balls? Why would you do that?

828
01:03:42,989 --> 01:03:44,982
Because...

829
01:03:46,857 --> 01:03:50,305
I'm a woman trapped
in a man's body, honey.

830
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:53,084
You 're no woman.

831
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,935
I'm just not your idea of a woman,
Walt.

832
01:03:57,896 --> 01:04:00,898
You're nobody's idea of a woman.

833
01:04:01,830 --> 01:04:04,211
They're my idea.

834
01:04:04,565 --> 01:04:10,816
Maybe I can under understand if...
if...

835
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:14,510
you wanted to be a woman, but...

836
01:04:16,555 --> 01:04:22,738
What I don't understand is...
why a man wants to be an ugly woman.

837
01:04:35,423 --> 01:04:38,264
Open up! We ain't got all day!
Come on!

838
01:04:38,289 --> 01:04:41,325
Walt! We didn't think you would come
to Vinnie's house

839
01:04:41,350 --> 01:04:43,355
So we brought the party to you!
Come on.

840
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:46,563
- Let's go. Let's go. Let's go... Come on, let's go.
- We missed you.

841
01:04:46,588 --> 01:04:49,600
Hey, you guys.
Is Waldo back here or what?

842
01:04:49,625 --> 01:04:53,069
Waldo Koontz is back.
The man's a true hero.

843
01:04:53,094 --> 01:04:55,975
I'll never forget that day
in that bank 14 years ago.

844
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,497
I heard it 43 times.
I heard enough.

845
01:04:58,522 --> 01:05:01,356
- I don't wanna hear it again.
- All right, I won't say it. I won't say it. I won't say it.

846
01:05:01,381 --> 01:05:03,449
Whatever happened to the other guy?

847
01:05:03,497 --> 01:05:06,821
You know, the other guard, Joe?
Is he retired or...?

848
01:05:06,846 --> 01:05:10,667
No, no. He got a great job in
Southeast Asia, something like that.

849
01:05:10,699 --> 01:05:12,775
- He is a smart guy. Right, Walt?
- Right.

850
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:17,631
Walt. I hear you're thick with the she he's...
or should I say long and thick?

851
01:05:17,656 --> 01:05:22,117
I'm taking speech therapy
cos it's in the building.

852
01:05:22,142 --> 01:05:25,221
It's in the building, fuckhead.

853
01:05:25,246 --> 01:05:28,282
- Yeah, Mike. And he's doing great.
- He is.

854
01:05:28,307 --> 01:05:32,971
Just I never thought I'd see Walt,
The Wall Koontz, hanging out with drag queens.

855
01:05:32,996 --> 01:05:35,503
- They're better fucking looking than you.
- Will you shut the fuck up?

856
01:05:36,339 --> 01:05:38,896
You're out.
You out?

857
01:05:38,966 --> 01:05:39,928
I'll get it.

858
01:05:39,953 --> 01:05:41,903
- Paulie, are you out?
- Yes, I’m out.

859
01:05:41,935 --> 01:05:44,403
- It's you and I, Vinnie.
- Come on. Are we playing cards?

860
01:05:44,435 --> 01:05:46,172
- We're out, huh?
- Yeah, yeah.

861
01:05:46,205 --> 01:05:49,039
Fellas, you remember Tia
from the dance club?

862
01:05:49,064 --> 01:05:52,405
Walt, you remember Tia,
 right?

863
01:05:53,293 --> 01:05:54,527
Whoa.

864
01:05:55,483 --> 01:05:57,196
Jesus, you know what?
We should go.

865
01:05:57,221 --> 01:05:58,834
- Look at the time.
- Yeah, it's getting late.

866
01:05:58,859 --> 01:06:00,893
We should get outta here.

867
01:06:00,933 --> 01:06:02,401
Come on, you guys.

868
01:06:02,426 --> 01:06:05,358
- Fix the chips out later.
- Come on. Come on.

869
01:06:05,383 --> 01:06:07,589
- Please.
- Hey, hey.

870
01:06:08,497 --> 01:06:10,625
Hey, Tia.

871
01:06:10,650 --> 01:06:12,686
You're a real girl, aren't you?

872
01:06:12,711 --> 01:06:14,206
- Will you shut the fuck up?
- What?

873
01:06:14,245 --> 01:06:17,305
Don't pay any attention to him.
He's brain damaged from birth.

874
01:06:17,358 --> 01:06:20,019
Alright, hey Walt.
Get your skinny ass...

875
01:06:20,044 --> 01:06:23,481
I'll see you next Saturday, alright?
My house. Okay?

876
01:06:24,716 --> 01:06:26,478
How you doing?

877
01:06:27,766 --> 01:06:29,127
Okay.

878
01:06:29,794 --> 01:06:31,745
This is for you.

879
01:06:41,431 --> 01:06:43,916
I can put them
in some water for you.

880
01:06:43,941 --> 01:06:46,418
Just let me know
where the stuff is.

881
01:06:46,443 --> 01:06:48,584
- I got it. I... I got it.
- It's okay.

882
01:06:48,609 --> 01:06:49,821
Relax.
No, I'll do it.

883
01:06:49,846 --> 01:06:51,682
I'll... 
I'll...

884
01:07:04,144 --> 01:07:05,539
Oh.

885
01:07:05,852 --> 01:07:09,750
I know how much you like
the tango so much, so uh...

886
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:13,915
I made a tape of those songs
that you like the most.

887
01:07:18,867 --> 01:07:21,714
Quality's not that great but...

888
01:07:24,517 --> 01:07:26,722
You get the idea.

889
01:08:06,237 --> 01:08:08,380
Thanks for the... the tape.

890
01:08:08,405 --> 01:08:11,791
Nice.
Nice. Nice.

891
01:08:23,010 --> 01:08:24,484
Walt.

892
01:08:30,491 --> 01:08:33,220
Well, you never asked me to dance, 
so...

893
01:08:35,788 --> 01:08:39,276
- Now I can ask you.
- No, I... I...

894
01:08:39,301 --> 01:08:40,985
It's okay.

895
01:09:07,784 --> 01:09:10,614
I don't have any money.

896
01:09:14,694 --> 01:09:17,581
Who said anything about money?

897
01:09:58,335 --> 01:10:02,425
Wait. Wait.
I get it.

898
01:10:05,492 --> 01:10:07,319
What?

899
01:10:07,961 --> 01:10:10,319
Tommy paid you.

900
01:10:12,998 --> 01:10:16,185
He feels sorry for me.
Didn't he?

901
01:10:18,272 --> 01:10:21,176
You feel sorry for me

902
01:10:23,325 --> 01:10:25,990
I feel sorry for you?

903
01:10:26,762 --> 01:10:28,909
No problem.

904
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:34,021
I never felt sorry for you, Walt.
Until now.

905
01:10:58,747 --> 01:11:01,325
Take it easy, Walt.

906
01:11:07,298 --> 01:11:10,456

All right!
All right, sweetheart.

919
01:11:44,554 --> 01:11:47,324
Very good, honey. 
Very good.

920
01:11:47,349 --> 01:11:50,559
Good song you picked.
Good.

921
01:11:50,584 --> 01:11:52,577
What's next?

922
01:11:53,753 --> 01:11:57,499
Honey, I think that's it.
You graduated.

923
01:11:57,841 --> 01:12:02,965
I thought you were gonna do
some songs, some stuff to learn? Huh?

924
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:05,701
Honey, I would love to keep
taking your money. You know.

925
01:12:05,726 --> 01:12:09,796
But you're doing...
You're doing really well, you know.

926
01:12:09,821 --> 01:12:12,161
And I made you a bunch of tapes.

927
01:12:12,186 --> 01:12:14,330
And, you know.
You can go practice them.

928
01:12:14,361 --> 01:12:18,824
Why don't you come by tomorrow at 5.
And you can pick 'em up, okay?

929
01:12:21,361 --> 01:12:23,427
- Okay. Good.
- Okay.

930
01:12:23,452 --> 01:12:25,758
Thanks for meeting with us.
Gentlemen.

931
01:12:25,783 --> 01:12:29,844
We've been discussing,
this year's Gay Pride parade.

932
01:12:29,869 --> 01:12:35,624
And we felt that it would be important...
well, a good idea, to show a united front.

933
01:12:35,649 --> 01:12:38,226
Synthesis, I believe.

934
01:12:38,251 --> 01:12:40,046
Right.
Um...

935
01:12:40,336 --> 01:12:42,730
We felt, as gay Republicans

936
01:12:42,755 --> 01:12:47,342
We thought it would be a really good idea 
if we could all come together

937
01:12:47,367 --> 01:12:51,547
and show the world our likenesses,
not our differences.

938
01:12:51,729 --> 01:12:54,054
To celebrate the...
um...

939
01:12:54,213 --> 01:12:57,328
- Synthesis.
- Right, synthesis. Uh synthesis.

940
01:12:57,353 --> 01:13:00,705
You 're very good.
You are.

941
01:13:00,730 --> 01:13:01,997
Sorry, go ahead.

942
01:13:02,022 --> 01:13:06,250
We... We could march together
as a united brotherhood.

943
01:13:06,275 --> 01:13:09,328
- What about the sisterhood?
- Uh huh. - Yeah.

944
01:13:09,353 --> 01:13:11,849
We march on foot.
No floats.

945
01:13:11,874 --> 01:13:16,052
Yeah. You think if you have no floats,
we won't do drag cos we can't march in heels.

946
01:13:16,077 --> 01:13:18,344
Well, let me tell you something, honey.

947
01:13:18,397 --> 01:13:21,238
We can march to Lake Titicaca
and back in stilettos.

948
01:13:21,263 --> 01:13:22,808
- So don't.
- Hey, that's right.

949
01:13:22,833 --> 01:13:24,417
Hey, let's just calm down then.

950
01:13:24,448 --> 01:13:26,769
Aren't you guys the same
group that, you know.

951
01:13:26,794 --> 01:13:29,910
Raised a shitload of money and
give it to Bob Dole's campaign, and he...

952
01:13:29,956 --> 01:13:30,966
sent it back to me?

953
01:13:31,005 --> 01:13:34,192
No, that's because he would have
lost support of the Christian Right...

954
01:13:34,217 --> 01:13:36,375
Exactly. 
Cos you're gay.

955
01:13:36,552 --> 01:13:38,829
You 're gay, that's why he sent it back.
Aren't you ashamed?

956
01:13:38,854 --> 01:13:40,973
Alright, listen.
You are right.

957
01:13:40,998 --> 01:13:43,992
We are different...
but not in the way that you mean.

958
01:13:44,017 --> 01:13:48,680
We're different because you are ashamed
of us, and we are not ashamed of you.

959
01:13:48,705 --> 01:13:53,564
Alright. Because as long as you get down on those
Banana Republican knees and suck dick. Honey.

960
01:13:54,277 --> 01:13:56,951
You're all my sisters.

961
01:13:57,384 --> 01:14:00,109
And I love you. 
I do.

962
01:14:00,865 --> 01:14:04,234
God bless you... 
and fuck off.

963
01:14:20,675 --> 01:14:22,667
Ma?

964
01:14:25,077 --> 01:14:26,785
Ma?

965
01:14:27,621 --> 01:14:29,198
Ma?

966
01:14:32,768 --> 01:14:35,154
Oh, my... 
Oh, my God.

967
01:14:35,186 --> 01:14:37,377
Jacko... 
Jacko.

968
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:39,919
Mr. Z, 
I didn't expect...

969
01:14:42,527 --> 01:14:44,296
Where's my mother?

970
01:14:44,321 --> 01:14:47,298
Leonard. 
Haven't I always been good to you?

971
01:14:47,323 --> 01:14:51,927
Good to me? You've always
been g-good to me, Mr. Z.

972
01:14:51,952 --> 01:14:55,778
Didn't I help you get the mortgage
on this place for your mother?

973
01:14:56,664 --> 01:14:59,594
You 're a saint, Mr. Z.

974
01:14:59,751 --> 01:15:03,089
I kind of treated you like a pet, 
didn't I?

975
01:15:03,795 --> 01:15:06,776
Yes, sir. 
Yes, sir.

976
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:09,082
Sit down.
Leonard.

977
01:15:09,968 --> 01:15:15,103
We searched every step of Raymond's route
50 times and still no money.

978
01:15:15,128 --> 01:15:20,131
Mr. Z, don't you remember that I was the one
that tipped you off? Don't you remember that.

979
01:15:20,156 --> 01:15:25,280
Uh-huh. And we searched every square
inch of that asswipe leabag motel.

980
01:15:25,690 --> 01:15:29,164
- And still no money.
- Mr. Z, please!

981
01:15:29,401 --> 01:15:33,797
I swear to you. I swear on my mother.
I swear on my mother!

982
01:15:33,822 --> 01:15:35,815
Oh, your mother.

983
01:15:36,741 --> 01:15:39,741
She said she didn't know anything either.

984
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:43,225
Even after we took her glasses.

985
01:15:44,879 --> 01:15:46,586
Mommy.

986
01:15:46,666 --> 01:15:48,658
And her hearing aid.

987
01:15:51,087 --> 01:15:53,079
And her teeth.

988
01:15:56,384 --> 01:15:58,375
Mommy.

989
01:16:00,887 --> 01:16:03,378
Mommy.

990
01:16:03,557 --> 01:16:05,549
And her little bird.

991
01:16:09,686 --> 01:16:11,678
Lucia no.

992
01:16:17,110 --> 01:16:22,256
Now, in exactly 20 minutes, Vance
is gonna deliver your mother here.

993
01:16:22,330 --> 01:16:23,713
Don't worry about her.

994
01:16:23,738 --> 01:16:25,770
I told him to soothe her
with a few milkshakes.

995
01:16:25,798 --> 01:16:27,646
And whatever the fuck else 
she could gum down.

996
01:16:27,671 --> 01:16:30,483
At the drive thru at Mickey Dee's.

997
01:16:30,538 --> 01:16:34,386
Now, if... and this is a big if', Leonard

998
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:36,969
if you are telling the truth

999
01:16:36,994 --> 01:16:39,354
Then someone in that
hotel got my money.

1000
01:16:39,379 --> 01:16:43,107
I don't have it. I don't have it.
I don't have it.

1001
01:16:43,132 --> 01:16:48,115
If you're a good dog
you'll fetch and retrieve it for me.

1002
01:16:48,471 --> 01:16:52,839
If you don't...
I can only come to one conclusion.

1003
01:16:53,183 --> 01:16:57,605
Leonard, if you spend one dime
that looks suspicious.

1004
01:16:57,646 --> 01:17:02,159
Next time, you won't be
swearing on your mother.

1005
01:17:02,566 --> 01:17:04,973
You'll be swearing on her grave.

1006
01:17:10,157 --> 01:17:13,096
Who is it?
It's Walt.

1007
01:17:13,492 --> 01:17:16,224
Oh, honey, come on in.
The door's open.

1008
01:17:20,498 --> 01:17:22,972
Surprise!

1009
01:17:22,997 --> 01:17:25,605
- Yeah!
- Ha, ha, ha...

1010
01:17:25,829 --> 01:17:29,193
Come on in the house.
Come on. Surprise.

1011
01:17:29,825 --> 01:17:33,406
Happy graduation!
Happy graduation!

1012
01:17:33,431 --> 01:17:34,904
Happy graduation!

1013
01:17:34,929 --> 01:17:36,302
Yeah, that's right.
Sing it up!

1014
01:17:36,327 --> 01:17:39,963
Happy graduation! 
Happy graduation!

1015
01:17:47,805 --> 01:17:49,478
Yeah...

1016
01:17:49,503 --> 01:17:51,646
Alright, Walt.

1017
01:17:56,555 --> 01:17:58,194
Alright.

1018
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:05,677
- Wanna dance?
- I'd love to. But I have to go.

1019
01:18:05,702 --> 01:18:08,647
Bye, honey. Take care of yourself.
You too.

1020
01:18:08,672 --> 01:18:12,185
Mr. "My Left Foot".
This is the movie I was talking about.

1021
01:18:12,210 --> 01:18:16,362
"My Left Foot". This is for you to keep.
Okay. It's very inspirational

1022
01:18:16,876 --> 01:18:18,060
Thanks.

1023
01:18:18,633 --> 01:18:20,625
Do you like my cufflinks?

1024
01:18:21,553 --> 01:18:24,118
And they really shoot BBs.

1025
01:18:27,516 --> 01:18:32,597
If you like this, I can get you another one.
It's called "The Hunchback of Notre Dame."

1026
01:18:32,645 --> 01:18:35,539
Have you heard of it before?
It's my favorite.

1027
01:18:35,564 --> 01:18:38,897
It's about this guy who's really misshape. 
like even worse than you.

1028
01:18:38,984 --> 01:18:45,340
And he falls in love with this beautiful
fiery, wild, gypsy girl called Esmeralda.

1029
01:18:46,115 --> 01:18:48,522
She kinda looks like me.

1030
01:18:52,453 --> 01:18:54,625
Come on.
Let's dance!

1031
01:18:54,650 --> 01:18:57,003
Pussy, pussy, pussy.

1032
01:18:58,358 --> 01:19:00,353
Pussy, pussy, pussy.

1033
01:19:00,378 --> 01:19:03,822
Oh, God. My tits are falling off.
Falling down.

1034
01:19:03,847 --> 01:19:06,349
Here, you wanna see 'em?
Here's what it is.

1035
01:19:06,374 --> 01:19:07,651
- No, no.
- Alright.

1036
01:19:07,676 --> 01:19:10,117
Hello! 
Pizza, everyone!

1037
01:19:14,273 --> 01:19:17,534
- All right!
- One's on the house.

1038
01:19:17,559 --> 01:19:20,123
Carmine, Carmine.
Let me pay for it.

1039
01:19:20,148 --> 01:19:25,414
We got 'this. I got one, and Carmine
and his folks are getting the other. I'll pay for it.

1040
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:27,013
Hi, Carmine.
Hi.

1041
01:19:27,038 --> 01:19:30,546
I have to get going. My father's waiting for me.
Have to get back to work. A lot of work to do.

1042
01:19:30,571 --> 01:19:34,554
Carmine, why don't you have a drink?
Come on, have a drink.

1043
01:19:35,829 --> 01:19:38,192
Let me touch your chest.
Like this.

1044
01:19:38,761 --> 01:19:42,420
Girls!
Take him down! Take him down!

1045
01:19:47,843 --> 01:19:49,585
No. 
You first.

1046
01:19:55,216 --> 01:19:57,313
My popper, 
good popper.

1047
01:19:57,338 --> 01:20:00,280
Give me a kiss, honey.
Give me a kiss, honey.

1048
01:20:00,305 --> 01:20:03,241
- She's sweet, right?
- God, how old is she?

1049
01:20:03,266 --> 01:20:05,202
She's a Leo.
You know.

1050
01:20:05,227 --> 01:20:10,044
-I asked how old she was.
- I... You know, I don't know. I..

1051
01:20:10,069 --> 01:20:12,416
I met her, uh you know when
she was wearing a uniform.

1052
01:20:12,441 --> 01:20:14,711
Oh, yeah? 
What kind of uniform?

1053
01:20:14,735 --> 01:20:18,144
You know, 
that school outfit or whatever.

1054
01:20:18,613 --> 01:20:23,217
- What school?
- The little Catholic place down the street.

1055
01:20:23,242 --> 01:20:27,082
- Junior high? High school?
- You know, yeah. You know.

1056
01:20:27,107 --> 01:20:28,749
Get to the shirt, come on.

1057
01:20:28,827 --> 01:20:31,078
Yeah! Carmine you're hot!

1058
01:20:32,917 --> 01:20:34,310
Yeah. 
Take it off!

1059
01:20:34,335 --> 01:20:37,402
Look at that. Oh, my God!
Look at his stomach, Jesus Christ!

1060
01:20:37,427 --> 01:20:38,769
Carmine I love you.

1061
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:46,737
Goddamn, Carmine!
I sent you an hour ago! Come on!

1062
01:20:47,056 --> 01:20:48,266
Hey!

1063
01:20:49,467 --> 01:20:51,434
Let him stay!

1064
01:20:51,708 --> 01:20:52,944
Hey!

1065
01:20:53,894 --> 01:20:57,048
Leave the guy alone. 
Leave him alone

1066
01:21:00,568 --> 01:21:03,323
Carmine, 
I love you!

1067
01:21:03,348 --> 01:21:05,331
Aww...!

1068
01:21:05,696 --> 01:21:08,132
Oh, my God. 
She shot me.

1069
01:21:08,157 --> 01:21:11,915
Oh, my God. I'm scarred!
And the big contest is tomorrow night.

1070
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:13,328
Oh, it was an accident.

1071
01:21:13,353 --> 01:21:14,836
-  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It was an accident.
- Oh God!

1072
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:16,475
I told you not to
wear those guns.

1073
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:18,638
- Look, you 're so stupid!
- Oh, no. I...

1074
01:21:18,663 --> 01:21:20,808
- Oh, Rusty...
- Let me look. Oh, my god.

1075
01:21:20,833 --> 01:21:25,485
- I shot my best friend in the tit with my cufflink.
- Alright... Alright...

1076
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:27,400
- I didn't mean it.
- Alright.

1077
01:21:29,759 --> 01:21:31,751
You know, 
um...

1078
01:21:35,555 --> 01:21:40,098
Honey, I never would have believed that we
could have gotten through this together.

1079
01:21:40,286 --> 01:21:42,616
I mean, I can't believe that I could.

1080
01:21:43,917 --> 01:21:46,478
And I mean that I could...

1081
01:21:48,275 --> 01:21:52,319
you know, actually be of some
kind of help to someone like you.

1082
01:21:54,363 --> 01:21:58,796
You know, the big hero and all
you know.

1083
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:03,305
I'm no big hero. 
I'm...

1084
01:22:04,832 --> 01:22:07,322
I'm... scared.

1085
01:22:12,421 --> 01:22:14,414
I need a drink.

1086
01:22:15,633 --> 01:22:18,170
What could you be scared of, huh?

1087
01:22:19,177 --> 01:22:21,423
What's the worst fear?

1088
01:22:21,448 --> 01:22:24,136
You know.
That you'll fall on the street?

1089
01:22:24,765 --> 01:22:27,493
Someone will  make fun of you?
I mean, what?

1090
01:22:27,518 --> 01:22:32,013
I'm... I'm afraid that women won't
want to sleep with me any more.

1091
01:22:32,105 --> 01:22:34,098
Well, guess what?

1092
01:22:35,692 --> 01:22:37,565
Some of them won't.

1093
01:22:44,616 --> 01:22:48,874
So you'll just have to find
the ones that will, Walt.

1094
01:22:53,082 --> 01:22:55,288
And just remember

1095
01:22:55,876 --> 01:22:58,548
This is who you are, Waldo.

1096
01:22:58,573 --> 01:23:03,172
You 're Walt "the Wall" Koontz,
a true hero.

1097
01:23:08,803 --> 01:23:10,726
Who's the little guy?

1098
01:23:11,264 --> 01:23:13,074
- Joe.
- Joe.

1099
01:23:13,099 --> 01:23:16,805
- Joe and me were friends for years.
- Um-hm.

1100
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:19,065
Best friends.

1101
01:23:20,939 --> 01:23:24,039
He really wanted to better himself.

1102
01:23:24,651 --> 01:23:27,671
I really admired him.

1103
01:23:28,155 --> 01:23:32,414
He went to school nights 
and on weekends...

1104
01:23:32,617 --> 01:23:35,062
to learn computers.

1105
01:23:37,328 --> 01:23:39,578
Got a...

1106
01:23:40,165 --> 01:23:44,812
big job in Asia with computers.

1107
01:23:45,003 --> 01:23:47,872
I drove him to the airport...

1108
01:23:47,897 --> 01:23:50,098
And off,
 Joe went to Asia.

1109
01:23:50,123 --> 01:23:53,445
Two days later, the bank...

1110
01:23:56,652 --> 01:24:02,554
...has... $200.000 missing.

1111
01:24:02,785 --> 01:24:05,713
Oh. 
Oh, Christ.

1112
01:24:05,738 --> 01:24:08,859
Somehow done from the inside 
with computers.

1113
01:24:08,884 --> 01:24:11,811
Nobody ever heard from Joe again.

1114
01:24:12,693 --> 01:24:15,918
I drove Joe to the airport.

1115
01:24:15,946 --> 01:24:18,841
Got used by my best friend.

1116
01:24:22,244 --> 01:24:24,950
I never told anybody that.

1117
01:24:26,081 --> 01:24:28,732
Some hero, huh?

1118
01:24:30,083 --> 01:24:32,374
Well... um.

1119
01:24:34,129 --> 01:24:37,727
Since it's confession night...

1120
01:24:37,831 --> 01:24:41,100
at Our Lady of Perpetual Disco.

1121
01:24:42,107 --> 01:24:45,991
I'm gonna tell you something
that I've never told anyone.

1122
01:24:47,497 --> 01:24:50,019
I've got...

1123
01:24:50,226 --> 01:24:52,764
Mr. Z's money.

1124
01:25:00,808 --> 01:25:02,151
It's alright.

1125
01:25:03,856 --> 01:25:07,127
I got here, right when you were 
being rushed to the hospital.

1126
01:25:07,152 --> 01:25:08,727
You know.
And uh.

1127
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:11,595
And when the cops left, I went up.

1128
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:14,170
You know. 
Cos Amber had given me, her key.

1129
01:25:14,195 --> 01:25:16,450
And told me where she had
always hid her money. You know.

1130
01:25:16,475 --> 01:25:19,567
She always had some money
set aside for her funeral.

1131
01:25:19,599 --> 01:25:22,080
cos she always knew that she was
gonna die young.

1132
01:25:22,105 --> 01:25:23,558
And of course, she did.

1133
01:25:23,583 --> 01:25:25,690
You know.
Poor baby.

1134
01:25:25,764 --> 01:25:27,887
So, where is it?

1135
01:25:36,514 --> 01:25:39,035
Right in here, honey.

1136
01:25:39,147 --> 01:25:43,044
Where Mama always knows where it is.

1137
01:25:44,066 --> 01:25:45,769
Right here.

1138
01:25:45,794 --> 01:25:51,809
In hips, ass and titty city, 
sweetheart.

1139
01:25:52,423 --> 01:25:55,408
It's gonna pay for my operation.

1140
01:25:55,604 --> 01:26:00,114
And when I come back
you know, a new woman

1141
01:26:00,196 --> 01:26:02,693
I'm gonna give Amber a funeral.

1142
01:26:02,718 --> 01:26:07,490
And a monument
and an eternal flame, honey.

1143
01:26:07,543 --> 01:26:10,285
Just like Princess Diana.

1144
01:26:10,455 --> 01:26:12,447
Wait a minute. 
You said that...

1145
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:18,877
You said that you needed
the money from the lessons, right?

1146
01:26:19,588 --> 01:26:23,102
What...  I was your..
 your cover?

1147
01:26:23,966 --> 01:26:27,077
So all the sewing jobs

1148
01:26:27,102 --> 01:26:29,937
The crying poor.

1149
01:26:31,932 --> 01:26:33,785
the... my lessons

1150
01:26:33,810 --> 01:26:36,888
That was all... that was all...

1151
01:26:36,913 --> 01:26:39,660
So that Leonard would not suspect you?

1152
01:26:41,507 --> 01:26:43,768
Wait a minute, honey.

1153
01:26:43,793 --> 01:26:46,674
So... you...

1154
01:26:51,324 --> 01:26:53,957
You used me cos of my condition.

1155
01:26:53,982 --> 01:26:56,222
Excuse me!

1156
01:26:56,384 --> 01:27:00,557
Check your playbill, Judge Ito.
You came to me.

1157
01:27:00,582 --> 01:27:04,063
That's cos I needed help.
And you used me.

1158
01:27:04,088 --> 01:27:07,897
Uh truth, baby?
You wanna play fucking truth?

1159
01:27:07,922 --> 01:27:12,063
You needed someone you weren't
ashamed to be crippled in front of.

1160
01:27:12,088 --> 01:27:15,207
All right? Someone you
thought was so beneath you.

1161
01:27:15,261 --> 01:27:20,737
You know. A worse freak so you could 
feel superior and still be the big fucking man.

1162
01:27:20,781 --> 01:27:22,559
At least...

1163
01:27:23,102 --> 01:27:25,597
At least... 
I'm a real man.

1164
01:27:25,622 --> 01:27:30,249
Everybody, including Wolf
fucking Blitzer on CNN

1165
01:27:30,274 --> 01:27:33,810
knows you don't think
I'm a real man, honey.

1166
01:27:33,835 --> 01:27:36,630
All right, what? 
Cos I don't... What?

1167
01:27:36,655 --> 01:27:39,541
Shit in the woods? 
I don't shoot guns?

1168
01:27:39,566 --> 01:27:42,235
You know? I mean, 
let me tell you something, baby.

1169
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:45,629
Alright. It takes a shitload more courage
to wake up and face my life

1170
01:27:45,654 --> 01:27:48,768
than anything you've ever
fucking dreamed of, all right?

1171
01:27:48,793 --> 01:27:51,302
You couldn't handle real adversity, honey.

1172
01:27:51,327 --> 01:27:52,285
That's the truth.

1173
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:54,036
Truth? 
You want fucking truth?

1174
01:27:54,061 --> 01:27:56,798
You ain't gonna be a woman.
You're never gonna be a woman.

1175
01:27:56,823 --> 01:27:59,110
You're an ugly fat faggot.
There's truth.

1176
01:27:59,135 --> 01:28:01,018
You're an ugly fucking fat faggot.

1177
01:28:01,043 --> 01:28:03,657
Darling. I am more man
than you will ever be.

1178
01:28:03,682 --> 01:28:05,230
And more woman than
you will ever get.

1179
01:28:05,255 --> 01:28:07,983
- You wish!
- Yeah, I do wish! All right, honey?

1180
01:28:08,008 --> 01:28:09,398
And if you didn't noticed.

1181
01:28:09,423 --> 01:28:11,185
And while the hate was pouring out of you, 
you didn't stutter once.

1182
01:28:11,210 --> 01:28:13,859
Now haul your sorry, 
fucking crippled ass out of my house.

1183
01:28:13,884 --> 01:28:15,597
Once and for all.
Move it, gimpy.

1184
01:28:15,622 --> 01:28:18,068
- Watch your fucking mouth!
- Or what? You'll beat the shit out of me?

1185
01:28:18,093 --> 01:28:21,202
- For starters, yeah!
- Your days of beating the shit are over!

1186
01:28:21,227 --> 01:28:24,885
- Face it, Waldo, your hero days are over. Alright.
- You're a fucking, fucking..  You're a fucking faggot.

1187
01:28:24,910 --> 01:28:27,738
I may be a female impersonator, 
but you my friend,

1188
01:28:27,763 --> 01:28:29,383
are a male impersonator!

1189
01:28:29,408 --> 01:28:30,256
Fuck you!

1190
01:28:30,281 --> 01:28:33,855
Yeah, life's a bitch
so I became one! Honey.

1191
01:29:21,948 --> 01:29:23,527
Oh, my God.

1192
01:29:23,552 --> 01:29:25,475
Look who's here, Sal.

1193
01:29:25,502 --> 01:29:27,356
We gotta say hello.

1194
01:29:28,107 --> 01:29:29,436
- Hey, Walt. 
- Hi Walt.

1195
01:29:29,461 --> 01:29:30,897
- How you doing?
- Hey, Tommy.

1196
01:29:30,922 --> 01:29:33,417
It's good to see you, man.
Welcome back.

1197
01:29:33,442 --> 01:29:35,239
That's okay.

1198
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:41,983
I'm going over there.

1199
01:29:42,205 --> 01:29:44,182
- We'll talk to you.
- Right.

1200
01:29:54,526 --> 01:29:57,479
Hey.
Walt.

1201
01:29:57,908 --> 01:30:00,260
- How are you?
- Okay.

1202
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:02,488
I've really missed you.

1203
01:30:02,725 --> 01:30:04,128
Well, thanks.

1204
01:30:04,153 --> 01:30:06,117
Mmm, 
flowers.

1205
01:30:06,142 --> 01:30:07,546
For me?

1206
01:30:07,908 --> 01:30:10,261
Not exactly.

1207
01:30:10,379 --> 01:30:12,411
Excuse me.

1208
01:30:19,266 --> 01:30:22,023
- Hi.
- Hi.

1209
01:30:24,291 --> 01:30:27,042
I brought you some flowers.

1210
01:30:28,945 --> 01:30:30,909
Thanks.

1211
01:30:43,423 --> 01:30:45,823
You want to dance?

1212
01:32:07,425 --> 01:32:09,919
This fucking cunt did not 
deserve to fucking win!

1213
01:32:09,944 --> 01:32:13,635
She's not a true fucking beauty!
This contest is fixed!

1214
01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:15,867
Hey, tell your stories walking, girls!

1215
01:32:15,892 --> 01:32:18,922
This group this way. 
You girls that way!

1216
01:32:18,947 --> 01:32:20,708
- Fine, Ms Perkins.
- Bullshit!

1217
01:32:20,733 --> 01:32:23,564
This is what gives 
drag queens a bad name.

1218
01:32:23,589 --> 01:32:26,217
You two are banned
from the contest next year.

1219
01:32:26,242 --> 01:32:30,273
- Maybe so, hefty.
- Yeah. Because, you 're old and I’m young.

1220
01:32:30,298 --> 01:32:33,599
And I'm gonna live to piss 
on your fucking grave.

1221
01:32:40,747 --> 01:32:42,751
Hello, buzzard!

1222
01:32:52,357 --> 01:32:55,060
This is the first time I...

1223
01:32:55,212 --> 01:32:57,952
since this... happened.

1224
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,258
I was real nervous.

1225
01:33:06,842 --> 01:33:08,835
But you were great.

1226
01:33:09,878 --> 01:33:11,914
You were great.

1227
01:33:11,998 --> 01:33:15,001
You were. 
I was nervous.

1228
01:33:19,572 --> 01:33:22,280
You just need to be around somebody.

1229
01:33:23,266 --> 01:33:27,072
I don't know, that... that likes you...
you know.

1230
01:33:28,288 --> 01:33:30,580
Just the way you are.

1231
01:33:32,497 --> 01:33:36,301
Somebody else said that... to me.

1232
01:33:36,865 --> 01:33:42,405
Said.
Some girls won't like you like this.

1233
01:33:42,550 --> 01:33:45,725
"You gotta find the one that will".

1234
01:33:47,397 --> 01:33:50,659
Yeah, well, 
they didn't bullshit you.

1235
01:33:50,684 --> 01:33:52,830
They told you the truth.

1236
01:33:52,975 --> 01:33:55,304
Whoever it was.

1237
01:33:55,646 --> 01:33:58,789
She must be a real good friend, huh?

1238
01:33:59,828 --> 01:34:02,113
Why do you say she?

1239
01:34:02,729 --> 01:34:07,780
I don't know. It sounds like
something a woman would say.

1240
01:34:08,775 --> 01:34:11,201
Why? 
Was it a man?

1241
01:34:11,493 --> 01:34:14,566
Well, not... not exactly.

1242
01:34:16,205 --> 01:34:19,545
Well, whatever. 
Whoever it was...

1243
01:34:19,784 --> 01:34:22,498
sounds like a good friend.

1244
01:34:28,884 --> 01:34:35,805
Good evening, Mr. Koontz. If you hear
anything in the building later tonight.

1245
01:34:35,830 --> 01:34:37,782
Like what?

1246
01:34:37,807 --> 01:34:40,324
Anything at all. 
Just ignore it.

1247
01:34:40,349 --> 01:34:42,812
Pretend it's not happening.

1248
01:34:44,022 --> 01:34:47,188
Do you know the phrase
Two closed ears, one closed mouth?

1249
01:34:47,213 --> 01:34:49,320
That's my motto and I follow it.

1250
01:34:49,345 --> 01:34:52,589
To hear nothing, to see nothing,
to speak nothing.

1251
01:34:52,614 --> 01:34:56,424
I... I don't care
what goes on in this rat trap.

1252
01:34:56,449 --> 01:34:59,422
Who you think you're kidding?
You've got the biggest ears,

1253
01:34:59,447 --> 01:35:03,156
the biggest nose and the biggest mouth 
of anybody I ever met.

1254
01:35:03,181 --> 01:35:06,168
Which makes you the biggest asshole.

1255
01:35:29,008 --> 01:35:31,001
Ooh, my wig!

1256
01:35:35,150 --> 01:35:38,585
Is everyone dry? Everyone dry.
All right, girls.

1257
01:35:38,610 --> 01:35:40,715
- Good night.
- Good night, Mama.

1258
01:35:41,354 --> 01:35:42,534
I love you.

1259
01:35:42,559 --> 01:35:44,674
We're starting on all new songs next week.
Alright.

1260
01:35:44,699 --> 01:35:48,636
Hey, why don't we go upstairs
and show Mr. "My Left Foot" that we won?

1261
01:35:48,661 --> 01:35:50,679
Walt is history, honey.

1262
01:35:50,704 --> 01:35:52,715
He doesn't like us any more.

1263
01:35:52,740 --> 01:35:53,786
I love you.

1264
01:35:53,832 --> 01:35:55,872
But I still like him.

1265
01:35:55,960 --> 01:35:57,702
Taxi! 
Hey!

1266
01:36:12,866 --> 01:36:16,410
- Get the fuck in here.
- Wh... What?

1267
01:36:20,663 --> 01:36:22,289
Oh.

1268
01:36:22,649 --> 01:36:25,585
So it's that kind of party, is it?

1269
01:36:28,233 --> 01:36:29,885
Where's my money?

1270
01:36:29,910 --> 01:36:31,342
Honey, this is where I came in.

1271
01:36:31,367 --> 01:36:33,676
Do I look like someone
who's got your money?

1272
01:36:33,701 --> 01:36:36,095
This looks like you got my money.

1273
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:39,641
$25.000 deposit
for an operation.

1274
01:36:39,666 --> 01:36:41,599
I earned that money.

1275
01:36:41,624 --> 01:36:47,619
$35.000 for a complete series
of female hormone therapy.

1276
01:36:48,255 --> 01:36:54,323
$25.000 for extensive
psychological testing before therapy.

1277
01:36:54,802 --> 01:36:57,424
Another $40.000 due.

1278
01:36:57,479 --> 01:37:00,408
You know, it costs a lot
to look like a woman.

1279
01:37:01,057 --> 01:37:03,465
Too expensive to look this cheap.

1280
01:37:04,227 --> 01:37:05,835
Fucker.

1281
01:37:06,078 --> 01:37:09,107
Death is cheap...
fucker!

1282
01:37:29,395 --> 01:37:31,102
Just give me my money.

1283
01:37:34,890 --> 01:37:36,053
You understand that?

1284
01:37:36,078 --> 01:37:38,566
Just give me my money and 
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1285
01:37:38,591 --> 01:37:40,422
Give him some more.

1286
01:37:40,447 --> 01:37:43,027
Give him some more. 
Give it up, you bitch!

1287
01:37:44,054 --> 01:37:46,247
No!
Stop!

1288
01:37:46,413 --> 01:37:49,358
You shot him! 
Fuckers!

1289
01:37:49,952 --> 01:37:52,745
Let him go! 
Let him go!

1290
01:37:52,770 --> 01:37:54,035
- Please!
- Why should I let him go?

1291
01:37:54,060 --> 01:37:56,128
Just let him go and 
I'll give you the money.

1292
01:37:56,153 --> 01:37:59,449
Rusty, don't do it! 
Don't do it!

1293
01:38:01,216 --> 01:38:03,546
- Walt!... Walt!
- I'll kill him.

1294
01:38:03,571 --> 01:38:05,943
Fucking bitch! 
Faggot!

1295
01:38:06,858 --> 01:38:10,033
Don't kill that bitch 
till I get my money.

1296
01:38:11,118 --> 01:38:12,411
Stop!

1297
01:38:13,933 --> 01:38:15,610
Okay, hero boy.

1298
01:38:15,635 --> 01:38:19,439
On a count of three. 
No money, no rest of your life.

1299
01:38:19,585 --> 01:38:21,777
- Sound fair?
- Okay.

1300
01:38:23,047 --> 01:38:24,317
It's in the bedroom.

1301
01:38:36,653 --> 01:38:40,183
Show me, you gimp fuck!
Come on, show me!

1302
01:38:40,208 --> 01:38:41,817
Where's the secret...

1303
01:38:41,842 --> 01:38:42,829
Fuck!

1304
01:38:44,399 --> 01:38:46,532
Son of a bitch!

1305
01:38:54,913 --> 01:38:56,552
Fuck you!

1306
01:39:00,162 --> 01:39:02,820
Come on, you fuck!
Quit your fucking sniveling.

1307
01:39:02,845 --> 01:39:06,914
Gotta knock that fucker down!
Knock that fucker down!

1308
01:39:20,118 --> 01:39:21,769
You motherfucker, you!

1309
01:39:21,794 --> 01:39:23,834
Where's the fucking phone?

1310
01:39:31,589 --> 01:39:33,224
Come on, motherfucker!

1311
01:39:33,249 --> 01:39:34,881
Stop! 
Stop...!

1312
01:39:34,943 --> 01:39:36,335
She's got a gun.

1313
01:39:38,068 --> 01:39:40,045
- Oh shit!
- Catch that cunt!

1314
01:39:40,070 --> 01:39:41,381
 Go!

1315
01:39:48,936 --> 01:39:50,642
Mrs. Spivak!

1316
01:39:50,690 --> 01:39:54,101
Call the cops! 
Call the cops!

1317
01:39:54,126 --> 01:39:57,308
Go away, or I'll call the police!

1318
01:40:15,923 --> 01:40:19,112
You ain't going nowhere,
you fucking gimp fuck!

1319
01:40:19,355 --> 01:40:21,089
Oh god...

1320
01:40:22,939 --> 01:40:27,842
Grace Kelly. "Rear Window", honey.
Alright.

1321
01:40:29,269 --> 01:40:31,365
Where you at, motherfucker?

1322
01:40:35,539 --> 01:40:37,635
Thought you, fucking get away, 
uh!

1323
01:40:58,576 --> 01:41:00,320
Oh, God.

1324
01:41:26,377 --> 01:41:27,842
Fucker!

1325
01:41:45,771 --> 01:41:47,960
All right, girl.

1326
01:41:48,393 --> 01:41:50,547
Linda Hamilton.

1327
01:41:50,771 --> 01:41:53,346
Terminator... 2.

1328
01:41:59,266 --> 01:42:00,620
My money.

1329
01:42:02,178 --> 01:42:04,231
You clever bitch.

1330
01:42:04,634 --> 01:42:08,537
Sticking my money in your 
fucking ugly girdle.

1331
01:42:14,411 --> 01:42:15,873
Hold it.

1332
01:42:17,955 --> 01:42:19,385
Put down the gun.

1333
01:42:19,410 --> 01:42:23,088
Before your girlfriend here gets a chance
to blow Liberace.

1334
01:42:23,702 --> 01:42:25,300
Put it down.

1335
01:42:28,286 --> 01:42:30,254
Now put it down.

1336
01:42:34,976 --> 01:42:36,470
Put it down!

1337
01:42:39,389 --> 01:42:40,982
Thataboy.

1338
01:42:43,050 --> 01:42:45,519
Now, why don't you slide it over here?

1339
01:42:46,202 --> 01:42:48,352
Aww...!

1340
01:42:56,979 --> 01:42:59,054
Walt Koontz and Russell Zimmerman.

1341
01:42:59,079 --> 01:43:03,543
- Can you confirm this self-defense story?
- Yes. Self defense.

1342
01:43:03,567 --> 01:43:07,394
They were criminals.
They were animals and brutes.

1343
01:43:07,419 --> 01:43:10,046
- They killed my mother's canary.
- What?

1344
01:43:10,071 --> 01:43:11,616
They killed my mother's canary.

1345
01:43:11,641 --> 01:43:15,011
I called the police. 
Do I get a reward?

1346
01:43:15,036 --> 01:43:18,785
Now, the name's Ivana. 
I V A N A.

1347
01:43:18,873 --> 01:43:20,865
- Last name?
- Man.

1348
01:43:20,890 --> 01:43:22,643
lvana Man!

1349
01:43:22,668 --> 01:43:25,944
I knew all night that something was gonna happen.  
Hi mom!

1350
01:43:25,969 --> 01:43:28,472
I won Miss Flawless for the third time.

1351
01:43:30,925 --> 01:43:31,800
Careful!

1352
01:43:31,825 --> 01:43:33,724
It's a shoulder wound.
He'll be fine.

1353
01:43:34,772 --> 01:43:36,572
It's Mr. "My Left Foot"!

1354
01:43:36,597 --> 01:43:38,878
I'm sorry. 
Relatives only.

1355
01:43:40,518 --> 01:43:42,639
I'm his sister.

1356
01:43:48,774 --> 01:43:50,917
He's my sister.

1357
01:43:52,266 --> 01:43:53,921
Thank you.

1358
01:43:53,946 --> 01:43:56,437
- All right!
- I'll visit you later. Bye, Rusty!

1359
01:43:56,462 --> 01:43:58,741
Community Hospital downtown, huh?

1360
01:43:58,766 --> 01:44:02,058
You got medical insurance?
How you gonna pay?

1361
01:44:02,118 --> 01:44:03,673
Cash, honey.

1362
01:44:03,698 --> 01:44:05,401
Alright. 
New York Hospital.

1363
01:44:05,426 --> 01:44:08,169
And I want the best team of surgeons available. 
Alright.

1364
01:44:08,629 --> 01:44:10,801
What! You heard me,
Nurse Ratched.

1365
01:44:10,826 --> 01:44:13,798
Alright. Burn rubber, girl.
We're going uptown.

1366
01:44:20,051 --> 01:44:23,064
Lucky you didn't cut your balls off yet.

1367
01:44:35,075 --> 01:44:36,536
- Come on! 
- Come on, girls!

1368
01:44:36,561 --> 01:44:38,548
Get him!
Get him!

1369
01:44:38,573 --> 01:44:40,770
You tried to kill my sister!

1370
01:44:42,196 --> 01:44:44,819
Mr. Z means Mr. Zero!

1371
01:44:44,844 --> 01:44:46,408
Come on!
Get out of the way!

1372
01:44:46,433 --> 01:44:49,257
Get off of me! 
It's police brutality!

1373
01:44:49,282 --> 01:44:50,842
Get off of me.

1374
01:44:50,867 --> 01:44:51,888
Get off me.

1375
01:44:51,913 --> 01:44:53,933
We've got witnesses!
Bitch.

1376
01:44:53,958 --> 01:44:57,876
- Get off of me.
- Watch my crown! Watch my crown!

1377
01:49:38,770 --> 01:49:43,606
