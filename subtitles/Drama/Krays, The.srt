5
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,026
I said the twins was cursed from birth.

6
00:01:42,787 --> 00:01:47,426
Ron! Enough!

7
00:01:47,481 --> 00:01:50,300
When they were babies,
 they infected diphtheria.

8
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,900
Reggie recovered but the doctors talk 
to their mother there is no hope for Ronnie

9
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,959
 But She know all they 
needed both each other

10
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,750
They brought Ronnie
home to be with his twin

11
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,534
The doctor said they nearly
survived by others per

12
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:10,041
aspect of violent crime
made a pact with the Devil.

13
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,750
Two Agents of Evil in
exchange one young life.

‫**** The rise of the Krays  ****

16
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,000
We grew up in a world where you
on both sides of the law was

17
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,350
Measured by a single store value

18
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,650
And violence was a currency assurance

19
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,778
If the old man get you when
you are growing up

20
00:02:38,803 --> 00:02:40,994
The chances world bloody
will laughing with

21
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,351
Fortunately the twins could fight

22
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:45,306
They were a school boys boxing champions

23
00:02:45,306 --> 00:02:46,885
Both of them could able to win

24
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,294
But wasn't right it is  for
triumph was draw for them

25
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,565
But the violence.

26
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,880
And it was outside the rings
keep them more than enough

27
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,153

I could spawn of pushing
 in fun in kiddin case

37
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:40,666
It seems that you won that

38

 And I said we don't do anything.

44
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,496
You need to learn some respect.

45
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:21,143
He could lose his brain

46
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:28,100

Nice place is

84
00:07:25,328 --> 00:07:27,831
Too little girls here.

85
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:30,135
Too expensive for a girl alone.

86
00:07:30,135 --> 00:07:32,093
is more a replace for couples.

87
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,415
Look at that space girle there

88
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,820
Costs a fixed weekly wage to talk to her.

Look who she is waiting

94
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,372

95
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,546
Who is that fellow?

96
00:08:04,546 --> 00:08:07,980
That's Jackspot ,He is
the chooser in London.

97
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,902
He is the chooser
in London, my ass.

98
00:08:10,902 --> 00:08:12,207

99
00:08:12,207 --> 00:08:13,734
Is this tent of him?

100
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:14,734
No.

101
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:18,799
He runs it and some tents nearby.

102
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,428
You sit cross what, Ron?

103
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,890
I've seen him once.

104
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,103
Years ago.

105
00:08:29,103 --> 00:08:34,050
He came down in a manner wear a cowboy hat
and boots. and had two gorilla with him.

106
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:42,928
I can't understand why a hard man in manner
borrow a scrap and run in a fancy dress

107
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,489

168
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,979
As Churchill would say

169
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,900
Never turn your back to...

170
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,253
When any frequent danger.

171
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,139
Or run away from it.

172
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,011
If you make it promptly

173
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,933
And in falange;You reduce
the size of danger by half

174
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,173
Run away
Never remain here !!!  ...Never

175
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,371

234
00:25:14,897 --> 00:25:17,198
The twins  move from strong to strong

235
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,536
(Regal) became the center
 of their operations

236
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,851
And the rock (Ron) and (REG)
look it as their fortress.

237
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,282
A place to retry entertainment 
and the two faces outside

238
00:25:27,282 --> 00:25:31,975
But for it was Regal's

00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,490
How long would it be this time?

It could be a few years. I would say

268
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:59,085

Shoot in a night club full of people ,

272
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:16,212
It seem to be bad step for you,( Kray).

But I told you.

276
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:30,675

277
00:31:30,675 --> 00:31:32,917
We have get a positive id

278
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,330

I don't think Rone knew how much you

Until then only showing their guns,

What is wrong he did or not,
remains of matter of debate

298
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,572
He will stop to be into
 a type of bigger boys

299
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,951
And there is anybody
will cross it off

Modify it, Bobby. Do your worth

331
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,568
Over the head

332
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,458
stick in him.

333
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:34,373
Good guys you send his brother
a message will not forget.

334
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,970
Good Boys.

335
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,620
Let's going to the other bastards.

336
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,812
You can say go bring me all day?

337
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,688
God will save you, Ronnie Kray.

338
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:46,124
What have I done this time?

339
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,623
Robbed The Bank of England ?

340
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:53,455
Set the fire to Buckingham Palace?

341
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,734
You know when I first meet you

342
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:09,330
I show sorry for you

343
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,259
Now go ...

344
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:28,000
look to see what you got to say
or fuck for you?

345
00:41:28,022 --> 00:41:29,950
I will  going before you
finish your paper work.

346
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:35,375
Not this time, Kray.

347
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,271
The victim is very determined

348
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,451
To testify against you.

349
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:46,498
And there were a number
of witnesses tell us so.

350
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,559
Is that was not enough.

351
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:56,981
the banging host on the attack was
found in the back of the car you were in

352
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:02,898
And you were found to be
in possession of a lamby gun

353
00:42:06,094 --> 00:42:13,286
In a word, Kray. You fact

354
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,019
The fact kill you.

355
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,892
Put him downstairs
 and lock him up.

356
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:56,304
we found the offended guilty my lord

357
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:37,524
Nice type of scotch

358
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:41,017
It seems the bad begin

359
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:53,570
Look at that.

360
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,778
Here I can get used to real class.

361
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:03,615
She is lovely.

362
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:08,099
Do you see what we can
 achieve without hassles.

363
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:14,415
Excuse me, Dickie.

364
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:34,290
It went from bad to worse.
For Ron.

365
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:40,572
The trouble started when he was
transferred for good behavior.

366
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:44,199
After a while he start to behave strangely.

367
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:48,029
Said that everyone had to have him.

368
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:54,785
Ron.

369
00:46:55,468 --> 00:46:58,766
Would you come to the game room.

370
00:46:59,155 --> 00:47:03,155
It's not good to sit here alone.

371
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:18,849
He burst into games room I went berserk

372
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:32,361
He was transferred to a mental asylum
and they said he is not find in sane.

373
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,737
I know how things stand, Reggie.

374
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,718
I spoke to one of his doctors.

375
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,899
Without medication,
 he's a time bomb.

376
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:54,243
He is a danger to himself
and everyone around him

377
00:48:54,243 --> 00:48:59,802
And you will never move him into
the inevitable explosion anyone else

378
00:48:59,802 --> 00:49:03,972
get out now
while we still can

379
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:15,309
Good. Have your way?

380
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,758
Hello dear.

381
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,453
Sying I and you pass good evening

382
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:38,987
I love your hair

383
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:44,341
Hello, nice face ,
Lady are you well?

384
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,568
Hi, Reg. You wanted to see me?

385
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:02,403
We need to arrange a meeting.
With the Italians and Maltese.

386
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:05,694
Ingress of gambling
we can make a fortune

387
00:52:05,694 --> 00:52:09,136
Standing in a distance over
we should sit down and talk

388
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,982
They feel solid nothing.

389
00:52:10,982 --> 00:52:12,375
The Italians are more easier

390
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:16,573
What about the  street gangs?

391
00:52:16,573 --> 00:52:21,408
No chance. After what I've heard,
 to me spit in our face.

392
00:52:21,408 --> 00:52:24,710
Not after what we have
done with their club.

393
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:29,707
I tell around.
I heard Ronnie quickly becomes free.

394
00:52:29,707 --> 00:52:31,970
Yes, we get it next week.

395
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:34,181
How is he?

396
00:52:34,181 --> 00:52:36,862
If he takes his pills
and drink keep himselve ..

397
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:38,995
He will be fine

398
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,940
Thank you for coming gentlemen.

399
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:59,037
I know you're busy
So I get straight to the point

400
00:52:59,037 --> 00:53:04,113
The new gambling law
brings new opportunities for all of us

401
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:05,938
There is more after around

402
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:08,214
Why would we fight ever?

403
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:12,131
It is wise now to
Find out what belongs to whom.

404
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:18,200
Each from them runs at term off
Free from outside interference

405
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:20,931
War is costly, gentlemen.

406
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,817
And no one likes to waste money

407
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,810
No one of you.

408
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:34,694
good.

409
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:39,092
Let's go to the business.

410
00:53:42,567 --> 00:53:45,526
Ron.

411
00:53:45,526 --> 00:53:47,825
What a lovely surprise.

412
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:52,627
I did you expect tomorrow.

413
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:57,672
You know Ronnie.

414
00:54:16,297 --> 00:54:19,630
How is the club?

415
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:23,072
you should come
and pay your visit soon.

416
00:54:28,086 --> 00:54:30,003
Vittor.

417
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:32,971
Nice to see you again, my friend.

418
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:47,733
Nice to injure here, Vittor.

419
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:01,089
What the fucks is going on here, Reg?

420
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:03,750
Why do we talk to these wankers?

421
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:06,211
We are not dealing with scum.

422
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,417
We take what we want.

423
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:14,033
Go on! Fuck up the lowers

424
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:19,040
Ron
-Don't ..

425
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:23,269
fucking touch me.

426
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:40,090
He took his damn pills

427
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:51,049
Excuse me, gentlemen. Dickie,
you close the meeting please.

428
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:56,107
Thanks for coming.

429
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:25,599
What did they say?

430
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,339
They said...

431
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:33,410
They understand  Ron illness
And they stay in your plan.

432
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:38,319
But...
-But what?

433
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:44,815
So long Ron go in the shops
they call not from the lines

434
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:52,379
It is funny just I am
It started already.

435
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,453
What can I do?

436
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:00,893
He's my brother
 for fuck suck in sick

437
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,058
Reg...
-What?

438
00:57:04,562 --> 00:57:07,379
Ther is more bad news.

439
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:10,412
just  you call for Jackie Taylor

440
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:14,768
He wants to have delivered Ron
at the tavern. Tonight.

441
00:57:21,283 --> 00:57:27,089
He wants Ronnie delivered?

442
00:57:27,683 --> 00:57:30,154
That's what he said.

443
00:57:30,154 --> 00:57:34,483
He said, " Be there or else..."

444
00:57:35,283 --> 00:57:37,970
We fucking will be there.

445
00:57:38,483 --> 00:57:41,792
And he is lucky if he
see a day again after we leave

446
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:50,521
They saw peuple operate and Ronny was mad
and dragging Reggie with him

447
00:57:52,723 --> 00:57:57,793
Tell that to Jackie Taylor and the others
who were beaten that night

448
00:59:18,643 --> 00:59:21,433
Ron got something else that night.

449
00:59:21,443 --> 00:59:25,522
He got the whole Reg and
the family under his wing

450
00:59:25,883 --> 00:59:27,888
For a while, at least.

451
00:59:29,891 --> 00:59:35,302
The Twins emerge from the flight with the Walton
 Street is the undisputed bosses of East London

452
00:59:36,683 --> 00:59:39,402
Then they Thought east land
 to the west Land

453
00:59:39,883 --> 00:59:47,883
In addition, they had a lot of luck, when
businessman Leslie Payne was joint the firm

454
00:59:47,976 --> 00:59:54,161
As I've already told you Mr Payne
 I have no interest in selling my shares in the club

455
00:59:55,803 --> 00:59:58,200
Quite. I do understand.

456
00:59:59,683 --> 01:00:03,317
But you listen to my terms before you
dismiss my clients inquiry out of hand

457
01:00:04,403 --> 01:00:06,386
What are your clients terms Mr. Payne?

458
01:00:06,386 --> 01:00:09,903
One thousand pounds.
 In cash, of course.

459
01:00:10,883 --> 01:00:12,546
A thousand pounds.

460
01:00:12,763 --> 01:00:15,037
My shares are five times of that.

461
01:00:16,843 --> 01:00:19,346
Calm down you have some exaggeration

462
01:00:19,346 --> 01:00:20,682
No Mr. bloody well not

463
01:00:21,763 --> 01:00:25,791
Else to introduce me to sell my share
in a very successful gambling club

464
01:00:25,816 --> 01:00:31,928
frequented by extremely wealthy
clients for only one thousand pounds.

465
01:00:48,483 --> 01:00:52,639
if you be kind enough
 to sign on the final page

466
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:54,839
Where your initials show in pencil

467
01:00:54,943 --> 01:01:02,943
I'm a witness the agreement
And all will be done

468
01:01:25,243 --> 01:01:27,357
Congratulations, gentlemen.

469
01:01:27,357 --> 01:01:32,116
Now ,I suggest you out of the club
order a bottle of champagne

470
01:01:32,443 --> 01:01:35,399
And introduce the new owners
 to the management staff.

471
01:02:15,123 --> 01:02:18,504
That was straightforward enough
-Indeed.

472
01:02:18,903 --> 01:02:20,970
Cheers.

473
01:02:23,583 --> 01:02:28,175
May I have another 500?
-No.

474
01:02:28,263 --> 01:02:30,642
What? but I've never refuse this.
- Now it is.

475
01:02:30,653 --> 01:02:34,522
I always pay my debts.
-I do not care>

476
01:02:34,522 --> 01:02:37,011
I'm David Litvinoff.

477
01:02:37,103 --> 01:02:38,936
That give fuck to you.

478
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,960
This play is rediclouse

479
01:02:56,583 --> 01:02:58,110
What was that about?

480
01:02:58,110 --> 01:02:59,822
The customer exceeded his limit.

481
01:03:00,183 --> 01:03:04,355
He doesn't understand he cannot
have any more credit

482
01:03:04,603 --> 01:03:09,279
-I want this kind stay under control
- How much does he want?

483
01:03:09,279 --> 01:03:11,285
Another five hundred.

484
01:03:11,285 --> 01:03:15,213
Give it to him.
I always like to make a customer smile

485
01:03:16,303 --> 01:03:19,530
With all respect Mr.
Kray,the success in this industry

486
01:03:19,561 --> 01:03:23,998
 is all about keeping
the bad debt to minimum

487
01:03:23,998 --> 01:03:28,832
Don't let me worry about that debt.
Gave him his five hundred.

488
01:03:28,983 --> 01:03:31,497
More you ready to
double the club credit.

489
01:03:31,503 --> 01:03:34,460
- With all due respect ..
-Do it.

490
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:39,583
The more mony they lose,
 the more mony we make.

491
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:42,097
Yes, Mr. Kray.

492
01:03:42,183 --> 01:03:46,732
And enough now trouble
 to turn in bad debt

493
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:51,366
Else the good one.

494
01:04:03,863 --> 01:04:05,547
Ronnie! please.

495
01:04:05,547 --> 01:04:08,543
Please Ronnie, no!

496
01:04:08,823 --> 01:04:13,894
Now where did you say you get
 your watch and jewelry bitch?

497
01:04:13,894 --> 01:04:16,871
So you sign the report
that we received earlier,

498
01:04:17,023 --> 01:04:23,298
That three men were suspend you
 by your legs from a flat window ?

499
01:04:23,483 --> 01:04:25,694
That must be mistaken

500
01:04:27,103 --> 01:04:28,822
All five of them?

501
01:04:29,303 --> 01:04:33,726
I have nothing more to say
now,  please may I leave?

502
01:04:43,703 --> 01:04:46,885
I'm sorry, Reggie.

503
01:04:46,943 --> 01:04:49,298
Just What I feel

504
01:04:51,283 --> 01:04:54,497
Frances, you know I love him

505
01:04:54,983 --> 01:04:57,099
And you say you love me too

506
01:04:58,903 --> 01:05:01,894
So I want  you marry me?

507
01:05:02,483 --> 01:05:06,713
I'm only 19. I'm
not ready for marriage and children.

508
01:05:07,463 --> 01:05:10,616
And then my mom and dad

509
01:05:10,663 --> 01:05:14,343
What about your mom and dad?

510
01:05:14,983 --> 01:05:19,259
They want  rid of the relationship.
-Why?

511
01:05:19,259 --> 01:05:23,645
I do not know.
Your own business ..

512
01:05:23,645 --> 01:05:24,789
What's wrong with you?

513
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:28,121
It is cookie for staff ,
and you rub frequently people

514
01:05:28,121 --> 01:05:31,151
 beat them up and
steal their money ..

515
01:05:33,651 --> 01:05:36,027
They said you felon.

516
01:05:36,343 --> 01:05:38,856
It is  better for women
waiting for knock on the door

517
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:43,742
than tell your husband arrant or worse

518
01:05:43,983 --> 01:05:46,496
I have to marry someone
 with proper job.

519
01:05:47,223 --> 01:05:50,137
And regim prospects

520
01:05:50,137 --> 01:05:52,672
Regim prospects?

521
01:05:52,672 --> 01:05:56,541
Half the millionaires
in London were once been..

522
01:05:56,983 --> 01:05:59,102
as fun free and wanna gen.

523
01:05:59,183 --> 01:06:02,371
That Ronnie and I planing to do.

524
01:06:08,663 --> 01:06:12,566
Give me a year, Frances.

525
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:18,267
Give me a year to show you I could be
a kind man that you and your parents proud

526
01:06:18,267 --> 01:06:21,864
I do not know, Reg.
-You can try, Frances.

527
01:06:21,864 --> 01:06:25,379
Let me prove it.

528
01:06:25,379 --> 01:06:30,402
And you can decide about that?

529
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:35,214
Please.

530
01:06:38,112 --> 01:06:39,128
Ok.

531
01:06:40,143 --> 01:06:43,176
I won't be up in case you want off in

532
01:06:43,176 --> 01:06:46,392
Until we finish a year
It is over between us.

533
01:06:48,078 --> 01:06:49,508
I understand.

534
01:06:49,508 --> 01:06:52,626
I make it happen

535
01:06:52,626 --> 01:06:56,625
I promise.

536
01:07:02,583 --> 01:07:07,560
So, How we doing?

537
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:13,606
Well Reg. Very well indeed.

538
01:07:13,743 --> 01:07:17,050
A license for long-term money.

539
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:20,948
We show clear on the ground this year

540
01:07:21,863 --> 01:07:24,175
There is a born
Every minute Leslie.

541
01:07:25,263 --> 01:07:31,293
In mean time, the protection payment for
 the gamling Westend club was doubled  here.

542
01:07:33,165 --> 01:07:34,812
That's good, Leslie.

543
01:07:35,123 --> 01:07:38,909
Maybe it's time to get staff about gain it.

544
01:07:38,909 --> 01:07:42,123
ben shops and restaurants that we could makes

545
01:07:42,123 --> 01:07:44,268
Then the money running in.

546
01:07:44,268 --> 01:07:47,439
And draws less attention from the police.

547
01:07:47,803 --> 01:07:49,680
I express perfect sense Reg

548
01:07:55,363 --> 01:07:58,798
What is this shit about  Leslie?

549
01:07:59,283 --> 01:08:03,244
If that was all gentelmen.
I have a train to catch .

550
01:08:03,244 --> 01:08:07,023
Reggie good evening.
-Thanks, See you tomorrow.

551
01:08:31,163 --> 01:08:33,636
Well !

552
01:08:34,923 --> 01:08:41,409
What is wrong with you?

553
01:08:44,443 --> 01:08:47,361
You.

554
01:08:47,843 --> 01:08:49,403
you go in soft

555
01:08:49,483 --> 01:08:51,950
That's what's wrong with me.

556
01:08:52,723 --> 01:08:54,122
Is tha go

557
01:08:55,203 --> 01:08:59,920
This plan will fuck
your head mind

558
01:09:01,243 --> 01:09:04,235
You supposed to be a man.

559
01:09:06,323 --> 01:09:09,769
Instead you looks a sick poodle

560
01:09:10,323 --> 01:09:13,289
Running around after her
 with your tongue on her heel

561
01:09:13,289 --> 01:09:15,274
Looking for bad on head

562
01:09:17,363 --> 01:09:19,513
you should try hanging the cat instead

563
01:09:20,163 --> 01:09:22,444
Then you might show more interest.

564
01:09:22,444 --> 01:09:25,091
Don't fucking talk about Frances likt that

565
01:09:25,091 --> 01:09:27,079
Or what?

566
01:09:27,659 --> 01:09:33,432
You let me or love her  make you sad
and strike your fucking tummy

567
01:09:50,523 --> 01:09:53,755
This is over; sit down

Call yourself for man.

570
01:10:01,896 --> 01:10:05,122
Take him outside.

571
01:10:08,731 --> 01:10:12,955
The closer Reggie was with
Frances, the more Ronnie fell

572
01:10:12,979 --> 01:10:17,826
And if the Ronnie fell frightened
No one will safe

573
01:10:22,083 --> 01:10:24,233
Hi Dickie, do you want tea?

01:11:17,514 --> 01:11:18,711
Time is not

588
01:11:18,711 --> 01:11:20,215

592
01:12:56,843 --> 01:12:59,516
Is this will  stop, Ron.

593
01:12:59,703 --> 01:13:01,437
You go stop drinking

594
01:13:02,523 --> 01:13:05,249
You go take your
medicine every day.

595
01:13:05,249 --> 01:13:07,164
 you hear?

596
01:13:08,323 --> 01:13:12,154
If you don't , it's only a matter of time before
you do something really serious

597
01:13:13,763 --> 01:13:15,560
And look you for good.

598
01:13:19,723 --> 01:13:21,840
We belong together, Ron.

This stay old

600
01:13:26,803 --> 01:13:29,495
Remember the Christmas card
mom sent when we were kids?

601
01:13:31,843 --> 01:13:33,040
She wrote:

I have it framed and hung in the hallway.

606
01:13:54,683 --> 01:13:58,389
Every time I walked there I said

607
01:13:58,389 --> 01:14:02,306

609
01:14:09,923 --> 01:14:12,562
I cross myself every time I see it.

610
01:14:13,643 --> 01:14:18,829
Don't point on this. If we can not act
togother You end up in the gutter.

611
01:14:18,829 --> 01:14:20,199

Depends on what?

632
01:17:10,146 --> 01:17:14,466
Have your MPs have
a real much power?

633
01:17:14,466 --> 01:17:17,190
Some do. Some do not.

634
01:17:17,190 --> 01:17:20,549
But wouldn't reveal
to come to the empire such

635
01:17:20,549 --> 01:17:25,100
But It is the Influence of

01:17:38,649 --> 01:17:41,167

You know ; People do in time

Their families are often our times in

645
01:17:52,697 --> 01:17:55,063
Which want help

646
01:17:55,063 --> 01:18:01,285
Sure It is not bad Idea But you have
something specific in mind.

647
01:18:01,563 --> 01:18:05,112
Yes. I want a sick prisoner

01:21:38,515 --> 01:21:40,577
It seems to be
obviously a worse

679
01:21:41,083 --> 01:21:42,477
Not so late, Teddy.

680
01:21:44,563 --> 01:21:46,758
Look at all these important men.

681
01:21:46,843 --> 01:21:48,162
With their dirty little secrets.

682
01:21:51,683 --> 01:21:54,338
and their silly bargains

683
01:21:54,963 --> 01:21:58,712
I wonder what would happen,
as their secrets came out.

684
01:21:59,603 --> 01:22:01,546
Imagine the scandal.

685
01:22:01,546 --> 01:22:08,065
What price with the desperate man
 on this ilande, Teddy?

686
01:22:27,763 --> 01:22:29,832
But there's  more and more spider.

687
01:22:31,688 --> 01:22:33,865
And there's more and more web.

688
01:22:44,203 --> 01:22:45,883
Good morning, gentlemen.

689
01:22:46,432 --> 01:22:48,301
I have good news.

690
01:22:48,643 --> 01:22:53,326
Today we start a major
offensive against the Krays!

691
01:22:55,845 --> 01:22:58,900
We are ready for it.

692
01:23:04,683 --> 01:23:07,516
Prime Minister, the Commissioner was arrive
-Ah show him in

693
01:23:09,723 --> 01:23:13,191
Good morning, Premier.
Mr. Secretary.

694
01:23:14,283 --> 01:23:16,834
I take the read this morning
 edition of the Sunday mirror

695
01:23:16,850 --> 01:23:18,820
"Peer and a gangster in yard probe"

696
01:23:19,123 --> 01:23:24,322
Claims police investigating alleged homosexual
relationship between a pair of the realm

697
01:23:24,322 --> 01:23:26,322
And the east against them

698
01:23:26,323 --> 01:23:27,959
With the suggestion of a blackmail

699
01:23:29,043 --> 01:23:32,699
Before you answer why would you
 find out if it is allegations is true

700
01:23:32,723 --> 01:23:34,283
It could bring down the government

701
01:23:34,283 --> 01:23:37,017
And undermined the political
establishment for the years to come

702
01:23:40,403 --> 01:23:44,506
Joe, we need the right
 anser from you on this one.

703
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:49,563
what I can say this, that Scotland Yard

704
01:23:49,563 --> 01:23:54,925
is categorically not undertake an investigation
 into organized crime in the capital

705
01:23:55,403 --> 01:23:59,675
In fact if you ask I can
go in a the records

706
01:23:59,675 --> 01:24:01,780
to see if the organized crime in
London is into the climb

707
01:24:05,083 --> 01:24:09,962
Excellent. Thank you, Commissioner.
That will be all

708
01:24:10,723 --> 01:24:13,630
Prime Minister,
 and Secretary.

709
01:24:13,630 --> 01:24:18,009

opposition leader on the phone.

710
01:24:18,009 --> 01:24:20,151

01:24:20,883 --> 01:24:23,262

715
01:24:32,310 --> 01:24:37,074
a political capital after the story
too close of the general election.

716
01:24:37,074 --> 01:24:39,099
That is very decent of you boy.

717
01:24:39,099 --> 01:24:42,960
well in pieces you can believe
me under matter of the rest.

718
01:24:43,563 --> 01:24:46,795
Arnold Goodman offers its services
at Lord Boothby.

719
01:24:48,023 --> 01:24:49,943
Better he than senior Tory lawyers.

720
01:24:51,123 --> 01:24:53,939
Yes, I agree. I am very
 much obliged for the call.

 both be fault  the rules

723
01:25:07,563 --> 01:25:13,744
Is it not strange, the leading Labour lawyers

After the perfume affair,we hold
the morale high ground.

727
01:25:23,227 --> 01:25:25,877
I have not the intention of losing
that so close to the election

728
01:25:30,163 --> 01:25:31,393
( Read )

729
01:25:36,523 --> 01:25:38,962
You mean, close down
the Kray investigation?

730
01:25:40,483 --> 01:25:42,962

736
01:26:14,842 --> 01:26:16,842
I am sorry Harry.

737
01:26:25,968 --> 01:26:31,080
The Krays are a no-go area

738
01:26:32,723 --> 01:26:35,195
Black state are then

739
01:26:36,429 --> 01:26:39,466

out the interest for the fraction worth

748
01:27:15,883 --> 01:27:17,883
So if I don't come to an
agreement soon

749
01:27:17,976 --> 01:27:22,707
there is something unpleasant
will happen to me on my club or both

750
01:27:24,547 --> 01:27:28,164
Well, the Krays are nasty and
a pieces of work Mr. McGowan.

751

No, Reg. That will be illegal.

755
01:28:31,043 --> 01:28:34,716
I mean, is it possible
 to nab the judge?

756
01:28:35,163 --> 01:28:37,721
No, absolutely not.

757
01:28:38,043 --> 01:28:41,219
Right could you tell Mr. Smith
to prepare a paper for Teddy visit

758
01:28:42,003 --> 01:28:46,471
and tell him runs go some
very compromising them before us

759
01:28:47,563 --> 01:28:51,521
And we all on the way of the sunday

760
01:28:56,363 --> 01:28:57,363

-Nego sounds down last time

762
01:29:00,374 --> 01:29:03,541

763
01:29:03,963 --> 01:29:06,728
On my side said this time of aid

764
01:29:07,083 --> 01:29:08,675
Find some one for Ron.

765
01:29:09,243 --> 01:29:11,393
His witnesses he said to go

766
01:29:11,763 --> 01:29:13,798

767
01:29:13,983 --> 01:29:16,152
On every site on the
gallery be taken of our peuple

768
01:29:16,177 --> 01:29:18,393

day of the trial .

769
01:29:19,804 --> 01:29:22,671
And I want every member of
the jury find out that now

770
01:29:22,671 --> 01:29:25,548

775
01:29:48,963 --> 01:29:50,457
The trial was fast

776
01:29:50,457 --> 01:29:54,222
The case of the twins fell apart
as witnesses has changed sides

777
01:29:54,222 --> 01:29:57,484
and certain members of the jury
 couldn't agree on the verdict.

778
01:29:57,643 --> 01:30:02,152
the twins emerge for reputation sky
height and become celebrities

779
01:30:02,172 --> 01:30:04,276
We are extremely happy.

780
01:30:04,276 --> 01:30:09,103
And all those charges against us
,unjuste to jury us and all false.

806
01:34:00,723 --> 01:34:03,395

01:34:56,403 --> 01:34:59,834
The club will give up, Harry.

813
01:35:00,003 --> 01:35:04,392
Those narrow bastards
 are the last thing we do

814
01:35:06,523 --> 01:35:08,956
Come on.

815
01:35:33,163 --> 01:35:37,232
Excuse you
-Hello Stranger.

816
01:35:37,232 --> 01:35:41,498
No Jack spot !
-I Grew up, and he need to have money.

817
01:35:41,567 --> 01:35:43,939
Has time been kind to you?

818
01:35:43,939 --> 01:35:48,117
Yes. For you too?
What are you doing here?

819
01:35:48,117 --> 01:35:51,956
I suppose to attain an Arab sheikh
 can offer shop company

820
01:35:51,956 --> 01:35:54,719
But that silly old sort

821
01:35:55,009 --> 01:35:59,875
Any gay men ah?
-No, do you mind

822
01:36:00,523 --> 01:36:05,523
Overseas customers want
 a little glamor for appearances.

823
01:36:05,767 --> 01:36:08,188
when the business is done
everyone goes home

824
01:36:08,339 --> 01:36:11,289

So you're worth  for that

827
01:36:20,181 --> 01:36:22,159
It's my lucky night.
I offer you to Dance?

828
01:36:22,243 --> 01:36:23,803
Why not?

829
01:36:34,883 --> 01:36:38,184

Yes.

836
01:39:27,483 --> 01:39:31,140
No I know that you
know me for money

837
01:39:31,763 --> 01:39:37,763
Now that you've been saying bad things
about me behind my back.

838
01:39:40,643 --> 01:39:44,457
That's not very nice now is it?

839
01:39:44,457 --> 01:39:47,826
Ronnie please. I had no idea
of  what you're talking about!

840
01:39:48,043 --> 01:39:52,892
I think you did
-look I am sorry, I had no idea!

841
01:39:53,403 --> 01:39:56,969
You are taking your liberties.

842
01:40:00,043 --> 01:40:04,874
You have a big mouth.

843

- I'm sorry if I offended you .
- I am really Iam not..- Sss.

844
01:40:23,862 --> 01:40:28,568
When I was little, David

845
01:40:28,803 --> 01:40:31,680
I loved comic books.

846
01:40:32,563 --> 01:40:35,889
First of all , I like Batman.

847
01:40:37,243 --> 01:40:41,132
Have you ever read
that batman comics, David?

848
01:40:41,132 --> 01:40:45,186
Yes, I have read them

849
01:40:45,323 --> 01:40:50,894
Yes , I always loved
the bad guys myself.

850
01:40:50,894 --> 01:40:54,962
You know, and I miss
your laugh  , David

851
01:40:54,962 --> 01:41:01,446
You always remind
 me of that villain

852
01:41:01,446 --> 01:41:06,833
How is his name ?

853
01:41:07,323 --> 01:41:09,296
Oh yeah....

854
01:41:11,883 --> 01:41:13,903
The Joker.

855
01:41:13,903 --> 01:41:18,079
Don't you think he looks
 a bit the Joker yet

856
01:41:20,070 --> 01:41:24,017
I can assume see
a resemblance , Ron.

857
01:41:24,283 --> 01:41:25,666
Please

858
01:41:25,666 --> 01:41:31,478
the problem is
his map.

859
01:41:31,833 --> 01:41:34,830
His map... is not quite right.

860
01:41:34,830 --> 01:41:36,941
- It is the wrong shape.
- Ronnie, please

861
01:41:36,941 --> 01:41:39,488
-The mention right.
-Ron.

862
01:41:39,643 --> 01:41:41,697

863
01:41:41,697 --> 01:41:42,510
- Ron.

864
01:41:42,510 --> 01:41:46,949
He needs to be a bit bigger

865
01:41:47,323 --> 01:41:50,301
- Please.
Do not you think?

866
01:41:58,403 --> 01:42:00,234
What is it, Dickie?

867
01:42:01,323 --> 01:42:04,110
A few words, Reg. Urgent.

868
01:42:07,549 --> 01:42:08,800

And I do what the fuck I want!

The posh accent not change the joe's saying

889
01:44:29,843 --> 01:44:31,834
Power corrupts.

890
01:44:31,923 --> 01:44:33,879
The greater is power ;
