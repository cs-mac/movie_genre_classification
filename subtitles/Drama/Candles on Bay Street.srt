{16528}{16623}I do not know. He said he was|gonna go check on Joe Leaver's cow.
{16633}{16675}Maybe she's already had her calf.
{16676}{16780}Well, she did, but Sam wasn't there.|- Hmm.
{16944}{16986}Where'd you go?
{17044}{17116}Well, had to go check on Joe's cow.

{17424}{17554}Is Sam back... Oh, Sam, someone wants|to see you. - Right.

{17950}{18005}Hi, Sam.
{18227}{18295}Kind of expected a bigger hello.
{18314}{18369}I'm surprised to see you.
{18412}{18502}Trooper, is this the guy who stopped by?|- Mm-hmm.
{18507}{18621}Well, I heard that you're in town.|I'm just... surprised.
{18670}{18757}So, you already met my son Trooper.|- No, not officially.
{18766}{18812}I'm Sam.|- Hi.
{18813}{18883}Dude, what do you do when someone|offers you their hand?
{18920}{18959}What else?
{18960}{19024}Nice to meet you.|- Nice to meet you, too.
{19083}{19135}I told Troop that you're a veterinarian,
{19135}{19210}and he wanted to come by|right away 'cause he loves animals.
{19211}{19249}Is that right?
{19286}{19438}I might know a puppy who needs a home.|I don't suppose you'd be interested?
{19447}{19487}Please, mom?
{19501}{19623}Mmm, wow. You have to take|care of him. - I will. Come on.
{19623}{19659}All right.
{19664}{19707}All right, wait right here.
{19744}{19833}Do you even know how to take care|of a dog? What are you gonna do?
{20073}{20123}[Whimpering] - Made a deal.
{20326}{20399}A gummy bear. You want another?|- Ok.
{20400}{20463}I'm Rosemary.|- Trooper.
{20687}{20787}What's his name?|- It's up to you.
{20800}{20841}Thanks, Sam, I think.
{20842}{20937}Just be good to him, bring him back whenever|he needs anything, it'll be on the house.
{20938}{20980}I'll take good care of him.
{21036}{21104}Oh, come on.|Good girl.
{21104}{21195}Hi Alice! Go ahead and take her on back|to number 2. I'll be there in a minute.
{21216}{21253}Alice?
{21277}{21328}It's me, Dee Dee.
{21339}{21375}Dee Dee Mashow?
{21376}{21434}Yeah, and this is my son Trooper.
{21459}{21566}Well, hello, Trooper.|My Goodness, I haven't seen you since...
{21567}{21615}Yeah, about 13 years.
{21616}{21682}Are you just visiting?|- No. I'm here to stay.
{21687}{21749}Well, good for you.
{21829}{21908}Sam, I... I can see that you're busy.|We'll catch up later?
{21908}{21970}Okay.|- Trooper!
{21989}{22046}Thanks for the puppy.|- You're welcome.
{22047}{22090}Bye, Rosemary.|- Good-bye.
{22132}{22188}Give him a good home.|- I will.
{22626}{22696}Why didn't you just tell me|the truth at the office?
{22696}{22742}I didn't want Rosemary gossiping.
{22743}{22769}About what?
{22770}{22838}About Dee Dee.|- What about Dee Dee?
{22842}{22870}Aw, just... nothing.
{22879}{22970}You're worried she'd gossip about|nothing? - We were friends.
{22973}{23067}We grew up together. I've known|the girl since I was 3 years old.
{23067}{23144}She, Ross and I hung out,|and she was fun.
{23155}{23237}Fun?|- We were just friends, ok?
{23244}{23305}People gossip about friends here?
{23306}{23360}It's a small town, Lydia. What do you|know about small towns?
{23360}{23392}You grew up in Boston.
{23392}{23472}I don't know, Sam, why don't u tell me|what it's like to grow up in a small town?
{23473}{23524}Tell me about your friends.|- What do you mean?
{23524}{23569}I don't know. What's she like?
{23579}{23670}She was a free spirit, ok?|Everybody in town knew her.
{23706}{23801}I was this shy little kid|afraid of his own shadow.
{23854}{23941}Once there was this kid who was|sort of the neighborhood bully.
{23941}{23986}He stole my baseball cards.
{24016}{24084}Now, I pretended that it didn't matter,|but it mattered to Dee Dee.
{24084}{24159}She found him, she bit him up,|and she got 'em all back for me.
{24160}{24200}That was nice of her.
{24231}{24327}She didn't even care about|what people thought about her.
{24328}{24414}In the ninth grade, she gets|caught smoking in the school bathroom.
{24414}{24463}The principal takes her into his office.
{24463}{24563}Before he can even get a word in,|she offers him a cigarette.
{24563}{24598}Mm-hmm.
{24699}{24737}Anyway ...
{24738}{24821}On graduation day,|she ran off with Bobby Langford.
{24845}{24896}You pass me the olive oil?
{24944}{25010}Is she the one you were|gonna give your class ring to?
{25060}{25131}Who told you that?|- Ross.
{25132}{25180}A long time ago.
{25180}{25224}Yeah, she was the one.
{25269}{25318}Pass me the pepper.
{25399}{25467}Not until you tell me.|- Nothing to tell.
{25468}{25506}Try me.
{25715}{25809}I was planning on giving her my|class ring the night before graduation.
{25819}{25904}We were standing out on her porch,|and I had it out. I had it in my hand.
{25904}{25962}I'm about to give it to her,|but before i can say anything,
{25962}{26012}she pops out with|with the news that she's going.
{26013}{26065}Next day, gone.
{26066}{26095}You never heard from her?
{26096}{26174}A couple of postcards.
{26194}{26324}One from some small town in Kansas.|Home of the world's biggest ball of twine.
{26331}{26394}"Ain't life a hood"|that's what it said.
{26394}{26433}Nothing more.
{26550}{26597}How come you never mentioned her?
{26634}{26683}I didn't think it was that important.
{27030}{27096}It's just that she was your first crush.
{27106}{27194}If my first boyfriend came into town...|- Look, I...
{27197}{27245}I got over it.
{27276}{27376}I married this woman|that I am absolutely crazy about.
{27402}{27453}Really? What's she like?
{27458}{27508}Oh, you'd have to know her.
{27541}{27598}Is she pretty?|- Pretty? No.
{27615}{27668}Movie star beautiful.
{27677}{27723}Smart as a whip.
{27748}{27828}Let's see. Terrific veterinarian.|Did I mention that?
{27829}{27911}Loved by people and pets alike.
{27955}{28026}I think we should ask them to dinner.
{28056}{28092}Really?
{28107}{28163}Gotta know the competition.
{28600}{28667}Hi!|- Hey, Dee Dee, Trooper, Lydia.
{28668}{28709}Nice to meet you.|- Hi. Nice to meet you, too.
{28709}{28764}This is Trooper.|- Hi, Trooper.
{28772}{28806}Hi.
{28845}{28916}Hi. It is really nice to meet you.
{28937}{28978}Well, come on inside.
{29105}{29174}This is for you.|- Oh, thank you.
{29175}{29249}Should I open it now?|- Sure. - Ok.
{29395}{29434}Oh, they're lovely.
{29445}{29502}I'm glad you like 'em.|I made them.
{29545}{29649}They're beautiful.|We can use them tonight at dinner.
{29658}{29740}I'm still working in the kitchen.|- Oh, good, let me help you.
{29848}{29884}What are you makin'?
{29884}{29983}Uh, nothing fancy. Some roast|chicken, mashed potatoes, carrots.
{30085}{30153}Uh, nut?|- Ok.
{30238}{30299}Oh, I love candlelight dinners.
{30299}{30363}Hmm. Me, too.|Maybe you'll be a customer.
{30363}{30440}A customer?|- I'm gonna open up a candle shop.
{30441}{30510}Here?|- Is that a bad idea?
{30511}{30574}No, it's not a bad idea.
{30575}{30612}But?
{30679}{30727}He's such a terrible liar.
{30743}{30780}He's learning.
{30813}{30945}Well, I just wonder if it's, uh... if the|town is large enough for a candle store.
{30946}{31065}Yeah, I've thought of that, but I figure if I|offer candle-making lessons, you know.
{31065}{31106}What do you think, Lydia?
{31110}{31172}Oh, I think you'll just|have to try it and see.
{31173}{31236}Well, would you be interested?|- Me?
{31238}{31305}I don't have that much free time.
{31395}{31474}So, how did you get|interested in candle making?
{31494}{31590}Well, it started as a hobby,|but then I had to make a living,
{31605}{31703}and, uh, I guess I just love|what candles symbolize.
{31713}{31774}Which is what?|- Home.
{31780}{31887}I guess hopes and dreams and wishes.
{31900}{31981}People light candles in church.|They use them for prayer.
{32002}{32078}Dude, you just can't eat|before everybody starts.
{32079}{32127}No, it's ok. It's ok. Dig in.
{32177}{32274}So, Trooper, how'd you|get the nickname Trooper?
{32291}{32363}It's not a nickname.|It's my real name.
{32368}{32448}Uh, we've traveled around so much,|we're like a small theater troupe.
{32459}{32507}So, you spell it with a U?
{32517}{32574}T-R-O-U-P-E-R.
{32579}{32666}No, TROOPER.
{32678}{32747}I gave him the name, so I figured|he could spell it however he wants.
{32755}{32799}Well, not really.
{32807}{32925}Yeah, that's right, because last year,|you wanted to spell it with 3 Os.
{33121}{33195}Troop, weren't you gonna|ask Sam something?
{33195}{33229}Uh, yeah.
{33229}{33334}Uh, do you have lots|of animals downstairs?
{33348}{33417}We sure do.|- Can I see 'em?
{33435}{33505}Sam, why don't you take Trooper down|and show him our ZOO.
{33517}{33611}Good. All right, come on, Troop.|Can I call you Troop?
{33612}{33643}If you want to.
{33670}{33713}Everybody calls me Sam.
{33714}{33754}He's a nice boy.
{33758}{33907}He reminds me of Sam... shy at first,|but there's a lot going on underneath.
{33937}{34003}I understand you're living|in your childhood home.
{34003}{34057}Yeah. Lots of memories there.
{34117}{34186}What brings you back|after all this time?
{34207}{34281}My mom died, and the house was just|sitting there,
{34297}{34333}but mostly for Trooper.
{34333}{34430}I keep boring him with all my stories|of how great it was to grow up here.
{34465}{34501}How'd you and Sam meet?
{34502}{34567}Oh, at Cornell in vet school.
{34568}{34620}He always wanted to be a vet.
{34667}{34717}I guess you knew him pretty well.
{34718}{34775}Yeah, hard not to.|He lived next door.
{34776}{34863}We spent every day together,|specially in the summertime.
{34891}{34973}So, you moved back here|after vet school?
{34986}{35059}I was a city girl pining for country life,
{35059}{35113}slower pace, nicer people.
{35154}{35220}You must have a lot of friends here?
{35235}{35341}Yeah, I guess I do,|but you married my best one.
{35561}{35624}Well, this is where we operate.
{35673}{35729}Is there a lot of|blood and stuff?
{35730}{35764}Sometimes.
{35775}{35816}How's that puppy doing,|by the way?
{35826}{35872}Mmm, he's fine.
{35882}{35957}What do you call him?|- Chewbacca.
{35958}{36026}Nice name.|How'd you come up with that?
{36049}{36112}He tried to eat my shoelaces.
{36165}{36205}Are all these yours?
{36206}{36261}No, they all belong to other people,
{36272}{36331}except this little guy.
{36345}{36439}Actually, this is|Chewbacca's brother.
{36442}{36497}You want to see him?|- Sure.
{36523}{36557}Do you get to play with him?
{36558}{36608}It's kind of hard|to find the time.
{36686}{36754}Thank you. Dinner was so good.|- You're welcome.
{36768}{36824}Want me to walk you guys home?
{36825}{36905}Nah, we know the way.|- Go ahead, Sam.
{36968}{37019}I'll be right back.
{37020}{37060}Got it?|- Yep.
{37105}{37141}Enjoy.
{37141}{37227}Remember that bike I bought|with berry-picking money?
{37255}{37312}The one you sold to|Jimmy Farrington. Ohh.
{37346}{37420}I wish I had it back.|I'd give it to Troop.
{37421}{37522}What's wrong with the one he has?|- Nothing. Just pure nostalgia.
{37529}{37661}Nostalgia? Coming from the woman who|could not wait to get out of here.
{37668}{37707}It's funny, isn't it?
{37718}{37811}Guess it's true you never appreciate|what you have until it's gone.
{37841}{37940}Hey, Trooper, this is Cee Jay's,|that place I told you about.
{37953}{38041}Same old place.|Same old geezers,
{38048}{38100}'cept now I'm one of 'em.
{38104}{38140}Ha ha ha!
{38244}{38284}Where's his dad?
{38300}{38338}Troop never knew his dad.
{38354}{38429}He was less than|a year old when Bobby left.
{38440}{38499}Bobby?|- Yeah.
{38528}{38624}Where'd he go?|- Alaska.
{38653}{38701}He never really wanted kids.
{38712}{38769}I can't say that|I'm surprised.
{38782}{38872}Sam, is that a polite way|of saying: "I told you so"?
{38929}{39015}How 'bout you and Lydia?|Any plans for kids in the future?
{39016}{39161}Kids? Yeah, someday.|I just want to be sure.
{39161}{39210}Sure about what?
{39244}{39357}We're financially secure, that we're|ready, time to devote to the family.
{39362}{39416}You haven't changed a bit, Sam.
{39432}{39465}I guess not.
{39477}{39538}I wish I were more like you.
{39550}{39610}I never thought I'd hear you say that.|- Oh, shut up.
{39611}{39677}I have learned something|in the last 13 years.
{40067}{40170}Last few nights,|I can't sleep. I wake up.
{40171}{40250}I go to my window|and look out at your window.
{40274}{40371}It used to make me so comfortable|just knowing you were there.
{40495}{40605}I'm so sorry, Sam.|I'm sorry I fell off the map.
{40605}{40699}Bobby and I got married right away.|Trooper came a year later.
{40700}{40760}I'm not making excuses, but...
{40781}{40857}I do really apologize.|- No need.
{40963}{41088}It's kind of hard for Troop,|you know, moving again to a new place.
{41089}{41135}He's gotta make new friends.
{41173}{41225}He seems like a great kid.
{41227}{41305}You know, in the meantime,|I could use some help around the clinic,
{41310}{41381}someone to feed|and look after the animals.
{41382}{41451}He would love that.|Thank you, Sam.
{41451}{41513}I... I have to make trips|back and forth to Boston and...
{41516}{41570}This is perfect.
{41571}{41617}What are you doing in Boston?
{41625}{41767}Oh, I have to pick up supplies.|Um, Lydia seems great.
{41772}{41917}Yeah, she is great.|I guess I got lucky.
{42075}{42174}I offered to let Trooper help|at the clinic. I hope you don't mind.
{42182}{42264}No, it's fine.|It'll be good for him.
{42268}{42334}And good practice for you.
{42361}{42407}You ok 'bout tonight?
{42420}{42490}Yeah, it wasn't as awkward|as I'd imagined.
{42492}{42548}She seems nice enough.
{42805}{42879}Check the brand of the food|with the amounts on the card,
{42880}{42945}and you feed 'em out of the right one.|- Ok.
{42951}{42990}Which one is it?
{43129}{43163}This one.
{43200}{43288}When you're working with a puppy,|sometimes they could be tentative.
{43289}{43385}You wanna try to coax them into a behavior|with a reward, a treat, like this.
{43385}{43441}So you wanna have|him come down the stairs,
{43441}{43495}but keep your hand|here so they don't fall.
{43495}{43541}Come on, sweetness.
{43541}{43595}Can I play with them|after I feed them?
{43596}{43661}Oh, I'd say that's a big part|of the job. - Really?
{43661}{43720}Mm-hmm.|- Gotta feed 'em first.
{43802}{43865}Wait. No. Ehh. No.|Try they're not gonna come out.
{43868}{43898}There you go.
{44111}{44153}Yeah. Ok, there you go.
{44154}{44198}Do you wanna give him a treat?
{44198}{44293}Ok. Reward him.|- Ok. Here you go.
{44293}{44346}Good job.|- What's the dog's name?
{44347}{44410}Jessie.|- Hi, Jessie.
{44411}{44501}Hey, girl.|- Perfect, except he's a boy.
{44501}{44550}Oh. Sorry, Jessie.
{44595}{44645}Oh, good.
{44652}{44755}Oh, I think he... - He likes me.|- He does. Ohh.
{44852}{44943}Now, don't be nervous, Naomi.|- Hmm.
{44958}{45019}It's just the entire fate of the game.
{45065}{45128}Oh.|- This isn't over.
{45129}{45183}Better luck next time, sweetheart.|- Excuse me.
{45187}{45254}Go. It's your turn.|- We'll get 'em next time.
{45255}{45290}Sorry about that.
{45308}{45402}How's the house coming?|- It's just a hole at the moment.
{45403}{45494}Rick is as slow as molasses. It took|him a year to do my uncle Ned's place.
{45495}{45565}He's careful,|and Ned has a great house.
{45569}{45634}Oh, and Sam likes careful.|- Boy, does he ever.
{45635}{45692}Yeah, well, you don't push him,|it'll be your retirement home.
{45693}{45785}Push who? Sam or Rick.|- Rick.
{45902}{45966}Come to think of it, Sam, too.|You better push 'em both, Lydia.
{45968}{45994}What's the hurry?
{45996}{46034}Funny you should ask.|Hey, Cee Jay,
{46034}{46076}you got anything to read|while we're waiting?
{46288}{46353}Oh, you weren't sleeping through that,|were you? - Sorry. I missed it.
{46354}{46401}You weren't sleeping, were you?
{46472}{46520}Mom?|- What?
{46521}{46613}What are these?|- What? - These.
{46627}{46721}Where'd you find 'em?|- In the drawer, in the kitchen.
{46886}{46927}That's Sam.
{46938}{46979}That's Sam?
{46995}{47055}He's so serious.
{47068}{47116}He's kind of chubby.
{47224}{47272}Who's this?
{47389}{47440}Your dad.
{47516}{47564}Can I keep it?
{47613}{47644}Sure.
{47674}{47734}Here. Put these back.
{48176}{48280}So, this is 154 degrees in here.|- What?
{48280}{48339}Yeah, but don't worry.|You can stick your finger in here,
{48340}{48436}and it kind of feels good,|but you won't get hurt.
{48446}{48536}Um, ok, the key to|making candles is
{48536}{48589}you can't hurry.|You have to have patience.
{48590}{48646}When I use that word with my son,|he rolls his eyes,
{48646}{48736}but I guess that's payback|for all the times I did that to my mom.
{48777}{48840}Ok, so each of us|needs to take a wick.
{48842}{48875}Thank you.
{48897}{49005}Um, you wanna hold it in the|middle and, uh, just keep it apart
{49005}{49051}so that it doesn't get stuck together.
{49054}{49130}Dipping candles are made|a pair at a time.
{49132}{49197}And dip the wick|into the heated wax.
{49197}{49295}How long do you leave it in?|- Uh, just trust your gut.
{49296}{49362}It's kind of like|cooking without a recipe.
{49363}{49410}A recipe? What's that?
{49455}{49509}So, you want to put it in for,|like, I don't know, 3 seconds
{49510}{49565}and then keep it out for about 3 seconds,
{49565}{49650}and then we're gonna cool them|off for about 3 minutes.
{49651}{49701}I know that they|look k-kind of skinny.
{49702}{49781}Skinny? What's that?|- Yeah.
{49876}{49976}So, he said go ahead|and buy it, and buy the horses.
{50038}{50094}That's what he said.
{50096}{50159}Hi, Lydia.|- How are you doing?
{50159}{50266}I was just passing by, I thought I'd...|- Oh, come on in. I'm so glad that you came.
{50266}{50315}Oh, come on, Lydia.|This is fun.
{50319}{50365}I'm just not so crafty.
{50446}{50570}So, when I sell my candles,|I like to put a little message in each box.
{50573}{50629}Um, if you're gonna be using them as gifts,|you might want to do the same.
{50630}{50668}Uh, like what?
{50680}{50855}I think candles help us explore|the darkness, you know?
{50891}{51010}People used to sit around the campfires.|Keep the predators away.
{51028}{51168}I think the firelight|makes us feel safe.
{51169}{51264}With good friends.|- You know? I do.
{51265}{51391}Can you imagine? There were, like, half|a dozen of us, all women, gathered,
{51391}{51456}learning how to make these candles.
{51476}{51525}It was kind of magical.
{51552}{51649}Sitting there in that room, I really|did feel a sense of something.
{51650}{51709}Fire hazard probably.
{51715}{51766}I'm serious.|- All right.
{51767}{51820}What did you feel?
{51842}{51887}You know,|for as long as I've been in this town,
{51888}{51971}I've never felt a sense of that|so strongly as I did tonight.
{51978}{52010}What?
{52019}{52074}A sense of community.
{52169}{52253}You know, I really do like her,|much more than I thought I would.
{52254}{52285}Good.
{52304}{52361}Tell you the truth,|I was a little jealous of her.
{52383}{52423}No kidding?
{52437}{52493}You knew?|- Oh, please.
{52648}{52718}I just can't seem to get him|to take his pills.
{52723}{52762}You just hold him like this,
{52762}{52833}open his jaw, take the pill,|and put it back like that.
{52834}{52916}Lydie, Frieden's Mare's|having trouble foaling.
{52916}{52946}I'm gonna take Trooper along.
{52947}{53009}He up to it?|- We'll find out.
{53010}{53077}Your call, but if he faints or heaves...
{53105}{53170}Sorry. We have a young helper.
{53693}{53726}Hello, doc.|- Hi Joe.
{53729}{53796}It's my new helper, meet Trooper.|- Hi. - Hey.
{54603}{54648}The foal hasn't|dropped into the birth canal.
{54650}{54721}She could start to lose|blood supply soon.
{54789}{54870}All right, hand me my kit.|Put it right here.
{55488}{55567}Ok, Sophie, beautiful girl.
{55599}{55666}This is known as the jugular groove.
{55666}{55755}It's easy to find, just trace from|the jaw angle down the neck.
{55764}{55886}I like to go in towards the north.|I press here. See that?
{55886}{55946}It increases the blood|pressure in the vein.
{56098}{56188}That'll take effect in a few minutes.|Be less dangerous for her.
{56189}{56234}And for us.
{56704}{56757}Foal's in a good position.
{56837}{56894}Now, both forward legs|are extended forward,
{56894}{56979}one a little less solid than the other,|but the chin resting on the knees.
{56980}{57051}Now if the neck was flexed|either side, the...
{57051}{57100}foal could have his head|cought on the way out,
{57100}{57157}which should be trouble.
{57158}{57212}But this one looks fine so far.
{57215}{57291}Only worry is how long it's taking?
{57416}{57476}See the tiny little hoof there?
{57478}{57544}Bottoms down work|towards the mother's feet.
{57561}{57640}We'd better move things along here,|apply a little traction.
{57641}{57696}All right, in my kit,|there's a set of OB chains.
{57696}{57773}They're shiny, narrow, stainless steel.|Do me a favor and go get 'em. go.
{57949}{58040}Sit down. Cinch the loop|just above the ankles,
{58041}{58082}it's not going to hurt when we pull.
{58150}{58209}When she pushes, we pull.
{58231}{58262}Ready?
{58423}{58462}Ok, stop.
{58501}{58610}Wait for the contraction,|this is most difficult part.
{58616}{58658}And... pull.
{58681}{58744}Good.|Pull really hard.
{58816}{58876}All right.
{59224}{59262}Hey, thanks, doc.
{59263}{59312}If he's not up and nursing in an hour,|give me a call.
{59313}{59354}Yeah, I'll do that, I'll do that.
{59364}{59406}Hey, that's some little helper|you got there.
{59407}{59449}Sure is.
{59549}{59585}Good job.
{59628}{59682}Thanks, oh.|- Oh, thank you.
{59712}{59762}See ya, John.|- Take care, doc.
{59763}{59843}Trooper, right?|- Yeah, I'll see ya.
{59982}{60035}You did a good job.
{60047}{60099}I was a little scared.
{60100}{60181}Nothing wrong with being scared.|You hung in there. Come on.
{60250}{60325}Sam?|- Yeah.
{60350}{60447}Did you know my dad?|- Your dad?
{60451}{60485}Yeah.
{60491}{60604}Oh, I didn't know him really well.|He was only in town for a year.
{60613}{60658}What was he like?
{60686}{60737}Well, let's see...
{60828}{60946}He was a cool guy.|I could say that.
{60968}{61030}My mom says he was a dreamer.
{61062}{61106}You could say that.
{61167}{61324}He left us to go to Alaska.|Dreamers have to follow their hearts.
{61325}{61369}They sure do.
{61372}{61413}Come on.
{61449}{61519}Kid thinks he's|some sort of romantic hero.
{61521}{61586}I couldn't even believe|what I was hearing.
{61598}{61734}A dreamer? Come on, the guy|was a lowlife who abandoned them.
{61774}{61839}Maybe you were just a|little jealous of him, Sam.
{61840}{61927}Lydie, the guy spent half the year he|was here working on his car,
{61927}{62011}the other half dealing pot.|How do you romanticize that?
{62043}{62105}What if she's just protecting her son?
{62106}{62146}By lying to him?
{62181}{62259}If he were your son,|what would you say?
{62388}{62427}I don't know.
{62587}{62629}All right.|- Thanks.
{62802}{62877}Well, looky.|- Hey, Cee Jay.
{62878}{62939}How you doing?|- I heard you were back in town.
{62940}{63005}Yes, you want to check my ID|for old time's sake?
{63006}{63037}Darlin', you never had an ID.
{63037}{63110}That's how come I to throw you out|of here. Nice to have you back.
{63111}{63172}It's nice to be here, legally.
{63209}{63245}Hello.
{63249}{63287}We were wondering if|you were going to show up.
{63289}{63385}I had to drive to Boston to pick up|supplies for the candle business.
{63391}{63438}Uh, candle mania sweeps the town.|- I know.
{63439}{63480}Even Rosemary joined the group.
{63481}{63531}Oh, no. Where will it end?|- Maybe it won't.
{63532}{63573}Everything ends.
{63613}{63667}Hey, Cee Jay,|can we get another glass?
{63668}{63742}We have 3/4 of the band here.|- What band?
{63743}{63772}Sam's band.
{63773}{63839}Oh, it wasn't my band. It was Dee Dee's.|- I didn't know you had a band.
{63840}{63947}I didn't. I wouldn't have even been in the|band if Dee Dee hadn't've browbeaten
{63947}{63989}the others into taking me.
{63990}{64040}What did you play?|- Guitar.
{64041}{64086}If you call that playing.|- I don't.
{64087}{64137}Oh, come on, Sam,|people liked you.
{64138}{64170}Because you did.
{64170}{64235}If Ben and Ross and I would've|started the band on our own,
{64235}{64272}it would've lasted 5 minutes.
{64273}{64314}Hey, I was good.|- Oh, we were awful.
{64315}{64391}Dee Dee, she was good.|- When did Ben move?
{64401}{64465}Um, a couple of years ago.|I think he moved to Dallas. - Yeah.
{64478}{64589}Do you still sing, Dee Dee?|- Yeah. It drives Trooper crazy.
{64590}{64623}So, how 'bout a song?|- Yeah.
{64624}{64668}Oh, you don't have Ben.
{64671}{64730}Unless you want|to do Ben's part.
{64731}{64778}Are you kidding?
{64823}{64874}Sam, you never sang for me.
{64875}{64924}Profoundly good reason.
{64987}{65101}*people say I'm the life|of the party 'cause
{65101}{65159}*I tell a joke or two
{65182}{65332}*although I might be|laughing loud and hearty
{65332}{65395}*deep inside, I'm blue
{65417}{65519}*so take a|*good look at my face
{65547}{65642}*you see my|*smile looks out of place
{65642}{65760}*if you look|*closer, it's easy to trace
{65760}{65855}*the tracks of my tears
{65970}{66068}Hey, kid, it's too late for drums!|Go to bed!
{66131}{66193}Guess what I did today?|- What's that?
{66200}{66279}I delivered a horse.|- All by yourself?
{66282}{66374}No, not by myself,|but I helped.
{66375}{66452}Yeah?|- It was so cool.
{66475}{66545}Guess what else?|Ok...
{66546}{66635}Sam, he said my dad|was a really cool guy.
{66713}{66905}Yes, really cool, just like your Mr. horse|doctor. Now, go to sleep!
{67095}{67150}I love you, mom.
{67201}{67255}I love you, too, baby.
{67353}{67439}Here's your friend.|- Night.
{67473}{67547}Good night, angel.|- See ya in the morning.
{67690}{67734}Hey, let's go to sleep, ok?
{68507}{68561}Guys, give me a hand with the wall.|Let's get it up.
{68587}{68662}All right.|- Would you like some coffee, sir?
{68662}{68732}1, 2, 3. Put it up.
{68767}{68834}Good. Slide it.|- Good here.
{68839}{68887}Looks good, Rick.
{68902}{68954}When do you think|the framing 'll be finished?
{68964}{69001}It's hard to say.
{69014}{69062}Can... can you give us a guess?
{69085}{69156}Well... - It's good.|- Not really.
{69177}{69226}Well, by fall?
{69233}{69303}Early fall or late fall?|Any fall?
{69324}{69369}Depends.|- Really?
{69391}{69442}What if we get into the winter and|the house isn't finished?
{69442}{69479}Yeah, that could happen.
{69481}{69549}Wouldn't that hurt the house?|- Not really. Why?
{69565}{69622}I'd just prefer if it|didn't fall down in a heap.
{69675}{69703}Picky, picky.
{70331}{70446}Hey, doc. How's that colt doing?|- Oh, fit and fine, like last week.
{70461}{70556}Not used to seeing so much of you.|- Thank my assistant for that.
{70618}{70676}What's his name?|- I don't have one yet.
{70696}{70728}Got any ideas?
{70763}{70806}Solitaire.
{70827}{70896}Aw, pretty good.|How come you picked that one?
{70936}{70973}He doesn't have anyone to play with.
{71021}{71053}Well, then...
{71064}{71131}that's what we'll call him.|Solitaire.
{71172}{71217}Honey, we're here.|Come on. quick, quick, quick.
{71226}{71276}It's all my fault.|- No, it's not, sweetheart.
{71281}{71357}I should've been there.|- Honey, it's ok. Come on.
{71379}{71412}They'll fix him right up.
{71437}{71465}Keep talking.|Come on, Cody.
{71466}{71533}Cody got hit by a car.|- Oh, my. Here.
{71534}{71574}Bring him on back. Sam!
{71691}{71750}What does it look like?|- Crushed lumbar vertebra.
{71779}{71865}Spinal cord damage|looks irreversible.
{71871}{71938}Abdomen's full of fluid.|Probably a ruptured spleen.
{71987}{72045}Maybe I'll take Amber outside|while you talk to Val.
{72053}{72089}Ok.
{72300}{72366}Sam would like to speak to you alone.|- Okay.
{72457}{72492}Hi.|- Hi.
{72537}{72572}You want to go over the X-rays?
{72587}{72622}No. That's ok.
{72635}{72662}Looks bad, though.
{72682}{72722}Is there anything we can do?
{72723}{72756}Well...
{72763}{72815}we could try to save him,|but it'll be painful,
{72815}{72867}and I can't give you any guarantees.
{72918}{72965}What would you do if|he were yours, Sam?
{73006}{73051}I think I'd let Cody go.
{73124}{73160}Okay.
{73201}{73276}Let me talk to Amber.|- Sure.
{73286}{73329}I'll let her come and say good-bye.
{73462}{73505}You're just gonna let him die?
{73539}{73585}I'd do anything if I could save him,
{73586}{73669}but he's been hurt pretty badly,|and he's in a lot of pain.
{73705}{73761}I don't think we should|let him suffer like that.
{73899}{73951}Trooper, where are you going?
{73966}{73993}Trooper!
{74309}{74341}Hi.|- Hey.
{74353}{74421}Troop home?|- Yeah. He's upstairs.
{74439}{74486}Can I speak with him?|I want to explain something to him.
{74487}{74553}I already talked to him.|He's pretty upset.
{74561}{74596}Come on in.
{74714}{74769}It isn't just about the puppy, Sam.
{74800}{74835}What is it?
{74858}{74894}You know I've been...
{74918}{74972}making trips back|and forth to Boston.
{75023}{75067}It's not|pick up supplies.
{75095}{75141}I've been going to a hospital.
{75153}{75186}What for?
{75234}{75266}Cancer.
{75287}{75342}Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
{75405}{75442}I'm dying, Sam.
{75522}{75561}It's widespread.
{75608}{75754}It's in my lymph nodes,|bone marrow, liver.
{75786}{75838}You must've had treatment.|- Yeah.
{75850}{75970}It's just a matter of time.|- How much time?
{76031}{76088}I was hoping to make it|to Troop's 12th birthday,
{76088}{76136}but it's moving too fast.
{76160}{76238}Does he know?|- More or less.
{76248}{76397}He's hoping.|I haven't told him the latest.
{76500}{76547}It's really why I came home.
{76583}{76620}So you can die here?
{76623}{76680}No, I want Trooper to live here.
{76697}{76766}I need to find him a place,|a family.
{76794}{76847}I had this crazy idea.
{76895}{76972}If I built this place up in|my mind, you know?
{76981}{77031}It seems so magical to me.
{77046}{77125}And I thought all I had to do|was come home.
{77144}{77216}Clearly I didn't learn a thing, cause...
{77241}{77317}When I was 18, I thought|everything outside of this town
{77317}{77387}was magical, and I just had to leave.
{77395}{77430}How 'bout his dad?
{77440}{77492}Come on.|You've never liked him.
{77559}{77593}You were right.
{77613}{77732}He got into drugs and dealing, and|it only got worse as time went on.
{77763}{77832}Well, after Troop was born,|he took off for Alaska,
{77857}{77922}said he had to|get work, you know.
{77968}{78048}He, um, got busted and did 2 years.
{78086}{78158}And when he got out,|he, uh, went right back to it.
{78190}{78230}He got himself killed.
{78269}{78329}And I never found out how.
{78524}{78606}I chose so badly, Sam.
{78653}{78711}Not just for myself,|but for Troop.
{78775}{78807}Aw, Dee Dee.
{78845}{78904}I'm so sorry.|- I know.
{78913}{78944}I know you are.
{78964}{79026}I need your help, Sam.|I have no one else.
{79055}{79093}Anything.
{79143}{79230}I need you to help me|find a place for Troop.
{79304}{79337}Please.
{79378}{79467}I just sat there with this stupid look|on my face. I felt like such an idiot.
{79519}{79561}But I didn't know what to say.
{79579}{79610}What are you gonna do?
{79612}{79685}I don't know.|Look for somebody, I guess.
{79714}{79747}But who?
{79781}{79853}Thought of John Frieden.|- John Frieden?
{79853}{79926}He likes Trooper.|He's got horses, you know.
{79927}{79978}He's over 60 years old.|- 50, something,
{79978}{80020}and Trooper'd love being on a farm.
{80029}{80080}What does he know about|raising boys these days?
{80081}{80115}They raised 2 kids.
{80124}{80160}That was over 10 years ago,
{80161}{80213}and his kids are married.|They have families of their own.
{80213}{80258}Well, do you think|he's forgotten how?
{80278}{80307}No.
{80336}{80415}But raising kids these days is a|lot different than it was then.
{80488}{80534}Just a thought.
{80610}{80678}Sam?|- Hmm?
{80680}{80727}I was thinking last night.
{80728}{80773}Yeah?|So was I.
{80776}{80873}About what? - Going over|the names of everyone I know.
{80891}{80923}We could take him.
{81004}{81034}No, we couldn't.
{81047}{81080}Why not?
{81102}{81202}It wouldn't work, Lydie.|Where are we gonna put him?
{81219}{81248}We're building a house.
{81251}{81293}She doesn't think|she's gonna make it that long.
{81300}{81350}We have a spare room.|We can fix it up.
{81372}{81447}It's not a practical idea.|- Why not?
{81459}{81508}Because we're not set up|for it. We both work.
{81508}{81542}Who's gonna look after him?
{81544}{81613}You have to make plans for things|like this It takes time.
{81621}{81688}I don't think this decision|is about being practical.
{81688}{81763}You've thought about this for one night,|ok? It's a huge responsibility.
{81764}{81816}We've thought about|having kids for a long time.
{81817}{81860}What about Val?|I think Val's a good idea.
{81896}{81960}Her husband out of work.|I don't think she can.
{81961}{82048}Well... -Then there's a group...|there's lots of people.
{82060}{82116}Why don't we just see how she does?|Maybe she's wrong.
{82135}{82202}She could live for another year.|She could live for 2 years.
{82220}{82290}In the meantime, I've gotta go|inoculate the Holden pigs, ok?
{82295}{82329}We'll find somebody.
{82570}{82598}Hi, Trooper.
{82607}{82666}Hey.|Is Sam here?
{82676}{82710}He'll be back soon.
{82829}{82887}I'm sorry I ran off like that.
{82914}{82982}It wasn't very professional of me.
{83034}{83126}Well, you know, I could use some|professional help with this fellow.
{83133}{83189}You wanna hold him?|Hold him by the collar.
{83192}{83224}Ok.|- Give him some comfort.
{83295}{83349}Sonny's having his operation, huh?
{83354}{83387}Yep.
{83397}{83466}Is he gonna be ok?|- He'll be great.
{83492}{83554}That's good.|I was worried.
{83737}{83769}You ever think about|having more kids?
{83798}{83865}Beyond the 2 little hellions we're raising|now, you mean? - Yeah?
{83880}{83920}Why do you ask?
{83931}{83964}Just wondering.
{83981}{84030}You've been talking to Naomi?
{84039}{84101}No. About what?|- Lydia been talking to Naomi?
{84101}{84150}Not that I know of.|Why?
{84207}{84268}Naomi's pregnant.
{84292}{84370}Congratulations.|- Ha-ha. Thanks.
{84401}{84435}I don't how we're gonna do it.
{84450}{84503}We're barely making it now|on 2 teacher's salaries.
{84503}{84537}Yeah, it's not easy.
{84603}{84667}You and Lydia thinking of, uh...|- No, not yet.
{84704}{84737}You still remember how?
{84758}{84787}It'll come back to me.
{84831}{84883}Sam, come on.|What'd you ask me for?
{84960}{84997}For Dee Dee.
{85484}{85518}Sorry I'm late.
{85531}{85579}Oh, you're never too late.|- How're you doing?
{85584}{85675}We were just gonna start to read our|messages we put in gift boxes, right?
{85679}{85742}Rosemary, do you want to go first?|- Oh, sure. it's always me.
{85766}{85874}Oh, this is for my brother-in-law,|Jack, who is a real... pill.
{85953}{86048}Jack be nimble. Jack be quick.|Jack jump over the candlestick,
{86048}{86158}but don't burn your rear, or you will see,|exactly the pain you are to me.
{86204}{86293}Not exactly what I had|in mind, but it works.
{86304}{86336}You don't know Jack.
{86488}{86554}Don't get excited.|Remember last week when the cat,
{86554}{86622}like, went through|an alarm and went all over the place?
{86622}{86683}It happens all the time constantly.|Besides, it's raining outside.
{86683}{86741}Doc, it's your new house.
{86742}{86787}Come on.|Dennis'll give you a ride.
{86787}{86837}Oh, no.
{86988}{87038}On that side!
{87255}{87310}I'm so sorry, Lydia.
{87340}{87414}It's just the framing.|It's not even a house yet.
{87448}{87484}It's a dream.
{87568}{87628}We... we can dream it again.
{87798}{87890}I kept the generator going to run the|pump. I was afraid it was going to flood.
{87903}{87953}There must've been|an electrical short.
{87971}{88024}I'm sorry.|- It's not your fault, Rick.
{88028}{88064}It was an accident.
{88069}{88103}When can we start rebuilding?
{88118}{88156}To clean this mess up?
{88178}{88240}Maybe it's coming soon.|I say we wait until spring.
{88277}{88310}Once the bad weather starts,|we're just going to have to stop.
{88310}{88350}What'd you think, Sam?
{89110}{89205}Sam, talk to me.
{89285}{89402}I had Rick do the house|because he was so meticulous.
{89424}{89583}Every nail, every joint,|every angle, just so.
{89683}{89765}I had him prepare the house for|a hurricane. Did I tell you that?
{89765}{89816}When was the last time there|was a hurricane around here?
{89816}{89878}I don't know, a hundred years.
{89958}{90088}He was going to truss the gables,|reinforce the garage door,
{90088}{90156}put the special adhesive|on the schingles
{90158}{90202}You can't protect against everything.
{90224}{90334}Not everything, but|everything you can think of.
{90362}{90411}But you can't think|of everything either.
{90447}{90484}It was a freak accident.
{90532}{90590}My mother was so|afraid of hurricanes.
{90602}{90636}I don't blame her.
{90668}{90758}Oh, she was afraid of|pretty much everything.
{90808}{90858}Every time my dad|would leave on a sales trip,
{90858}{90904}he'd make sure we had|everything we needed.
{90916}{90960}Check the tires, check the house,
{90961}{91033}the rain gutters, the shutters,|did we have enough firewood,
{91033}{91129}and on and on and on,|and still this woman, she was afraid.
{91140}{91201}Of what?|- You name it.
{91233}{91299}I used to hear her walking|around the house late at night,
{91304}{91369}making sure all|the windows were locked,
{91374}{91425}and every time I'd leave the house,
{91434}{91506}my mother would ask me|if I have enough money.
{91507}{91554}Where are you going?
{91565}{91622}Are your socks warm enough?
{91627}{91705}I used to think I could actually|hear her worrying.
{91724}{91783}Got to a point where I didn't|even want to leave the house.
{91826}{91888}It was easier just|to stay at home.
{92051}{92133}I mean, if it hadn't been for Dee Dee,|I probably would've never left the yard.
{92152}{92204}She sounds like she was|a good friend to have.
{92281}{92319}She was more than that.
{92407}{92549}She was my friend,|my sister, my...
{92972}{93031}Do you think I'd be a good father?
{93068}{93113}Oh, Sam, yes.
{93206}{93247}Yes, I do.
{93292}{93325}Then let's take him.
{93433}{93470}Are you sure?
{94214}{94240}Hi.
{94256}{94306}Can we come in?|- Sure. - Ok.
{94495}{94523}What's up?
{94567}{94595}Where's Troop?
{94616}{94663}He's upstairs playing with Chewbacca.
{95133}{95172}We want to take him.
{95246}{95327}Are you sure?|- Yes. When the time comes.
{95348}{95390}We're still hoping it won't.
{95459}{95500}I don't know what to say.
{95519}{95554}You don't have to say anything.
{95573}{95635}I couldn't have even hoped for this.
{95665}{95695}Oh, Sam,
{95697}{95799}I'm so proud of you.|- Oh, we're both crazy about him.
{95799}{95857}That's great, but that's|not why I'm proud of you.
{95863}{95952}Ok, why are you proud of me?|- Because you married well.
{96088}{96155}Oh, I wanna have a party, a big one.
{96161}{96189}A party?
{96208}{96249}Hmm, might be my last chance.
{96992}{97071}Hey, Trooper, can I come in?|- Sure.
{97189}{97281}Did you have fun with Rosemary today?|- It was great.
{97311}{97347}Want to snuggle?
{97819}{97907}Remember how we always said we'd|hope for the best when I got sick?
{97927}{97959}Yeah.
{97998}{98089}Well,|sometimes the best doesn't happen,
{98111}{98178}and then we have to make other plans.
{98198}{98262}We have to make the best|of things as they are.
{98389}{98481}So, it looks like the best|isn't gonna happen.
{98669}{98727}If I'm not gonna be around...
{98816}{98847}If I'm not gonna be around,
{98847}{98911}we're gonna have to find|a place for you, Troop.
{98922}{98954}I don't want to.
{98971}{99088}I know, baby, but we gotta make|the best of things, don't we?
{99098}{99129}Maybe...
{99137}{99178}maybe my dad will come back.
{99188}{99270}Oh, Troop.|- He... he could.
{99288}{99350}It's been a very long time.
{99358}{99432}But he still could, mom.
{99491}{99625}But in the meantime, we have to find|a place for you where you'll be safe
{99625}{99707}and happy, where people'll love you
{99714}{99771}and who'll take care of you.
{99968}{100062}You know Sam and Lydia?|They love you very much.
{100081}{100117}Do you know that?
{100173}{100210}I know it.
{100220}{100262}Do you know how I know it?
{100400}{100494}'Cause they said that if...|if anything happened to me,
{100527}{100587}if I didn't get better,
{100610}{100681}that they would love|to have you live with them.
{100695}{100730}How would you feel about that?
{100737}{100782}I don't want to, mom.
{100790}{100825}I know, baby,
{100834}{100911}but as long as we're talking about|making the best of things,
{100913}{100968}can you think of a place you'd rather be?
{101107}{101159}Do you like them, Troop?
{101337}{101395}I like them very much.
{101419}{101513}In fact, I can't think of|anyone I'd rather you be with.
{101538}{101561}Can you?
{101743}{101783}Can we still hope?
{101823}{101867}Hope what?
{101886}{101929}That you'll get better?
{101977}{102007}Come here.
{102048}{102113}Yeah, we can still hope.
{102141}{102190}I'm still gonna hope, then.
{102245}{102277}Me, too.
{102779}{102819}Hi! How are you?
{102899}{102959}Where is it?|- I'll show you.
{103019}{103069}Excellent. Now that's quick.
{103069}{103154}Selma, have you been taken care of?|Stop running! Hey, you. Not so fast.
{103154}{103190}How 'bout.. did you get something?
{103190}{103249}Oh, you did? You got something.|Excellent.
{103254}{103293}Who else needs a drink?
{103299}{103336}You need a drink?
{103390}{103458}Hi.|- Dee Dee, you look great.
{103495}{103525}This is wonderful.
{103559}{103612}Come on.|This is my specialty.
{103643}{103699}Macaroni and three|different kinds of cheese.
{103736}{103765}Thank you.
{103849}{103894}Sit down.|- Yeah. Go sit down.
{103894}{103972}I'll...I'll fix the table.|- All right.
{103973}{104014}Go on.|- Okay.
{104050}{104098}You're doing so much.
{104159}{104203}Hey.
{104277}{104333}Ladies and gentlemen...
{104348}{104426}for one night only, we present|the return of Dee Dee
{104433}{104468}and the Deadbeats.
{104551}{104636}Dee Dee, would you do us the great honor|of leading us through our theme song?
{104639}{104715}Oh, Sam. I'm sorry.|I can't.
{104718}{104747}Oh, come on!
{104767}{104817}But I wanna watch you guys. Go.
{104841}{104885}Ohh. What's the name of the song?
{104902}{104932}"You've Got a Friend"
{104937}{104971}Oh, I know that, I...|Well, get up here.
{104976}{105009}All right.
{105018}{105069}I'm doing this for you.
{105069}{105127}I love you.|- Go get 'em.
{105127}{105174}Yay for me.
{105181}{105289}And we do have a special guest on the|drums tonight, mr. Trooper Mashow.
{105327}{105366}All right, Trooper!
{105405}{105448}What key do you guys play in?
{105460}{105526}What key do you sing it in?|- Oh, it doesn't matter.
{105526}{105574}That sounds fine.
{105600}{105714}*When you're down and troubled
{105724}{105835}*and you need a helpin' hand
{105840}{106050}*and nothin', nothin',|nothin' is goin' right
{106060}{106095}Come on, girls.
{106095}{106210}*Close your eyes and think of me
{106210}{106323}*and soon I will be there
{106330}{106545}*to brighten up even the darkest nights

{108299}{108368}Troop, you were so great.
{108368}{108430}Hey, look at this.
{108470}{108507}What's that?
{108546}{108588}A little welcome-home present.
{108613}{108652}It's huge.
{108671}{108730}Open it!|Open it, Dee Dee! Come on!
{108731}{108776}Ok, ok.
{108857}{108909}Get that sucker open.
{108980}{109020}Check that out.
{109144}{109179}My bike.
{109220}{109259}Hey.
{109260}{109300}Whoa!
{109322}{109362}Where'd you find it?
{109364}{109434}Well, I thought|Jimmy Farrington had it, but
{109440}{109525}he'd sold it to Marty and Neil|halfen and Neil thought Marty had it,
{109525}{109550}and Marty thought Neil had it.
{109550}{109605}Both forgot they gave|it to their little sister,
{109605}{109653}and it was in her|basement collecting cobwebs.
{109653}{109690}But it looks brand-new.
{109692}{109750}That's just the new seat,|some fresh paint.
{109752}{109825}Oh, Troop, this is the bike I rode|when I was your age.
{109839}{109975}It's... cool.|Well, sort of.
{109993}{110060}Excuse me.|It's the coolest bike ever.
{110062}{110155}I'm taking it for a ride.|- Oh, let me help you.
{110165}{110200}Ok, ok, I got it. I got it.
{110202}{110246}All right, now, don't go crazy
{110251}{110312}all at once, you know.|- Shut up, you guys.
{110312}{110370}We'll find a place over here. - I put|it in first gear, so, you know, go easy.
{110370}{110433}Yeah, ok, Ross, I've ridden a bike before.
{110433}{110500}Ok, well, this is just like that.|- All right.
{110710}{110753}Sam, maybe she shouldn't.
{110757}{110804}You should know her by now.
{110910}{110960}Whoo!
{112609}{112651}Hey ya, Rick.|- Hey.
{112671}{112735}How's the cleanup comin'?|- Ah, it's comin'.
{112751}{112812}I want to start the new construction.
{112841}{112904}You mean now?|- Right away.
{112906}{112948}Soon as you're|finished with the cleanup.
{112948}{113022}Don't think sense, Sam, we'll be|caught right in the middle of winter.
{113024}{113069}Aw, let's take a chance.
{113075}{113114}We might have decent weather.
{113116}{113149}What if we don't?
{113156}{113216}We'll shut it down till spring.
{113218}{113286}But then we'll be left with all this|material just hanging around all winter.
{113287}{113328}It's not gonna hurt it, is it?
{113369}{113406}Well, I suppose not.
{113425}{113452}What's the hurry?
{113467}{113518}I'm gonna fill that house up with kids.
{113539}{113570}Thanks, Rick.
{113585}{113652}Is Lydie pregnant?|- No, not yet.
{113700}{113741}It takes 9 months, you know.
{113758}{113790}Not always.
{113926}{113970}Amber's gonna take|Chewbacca's brother.
{113974}{114048}Oh, great, Amber. I'm glad.|- Are you gonna take him today?
{114048}{114117}Aha.|- Trooper, go bring him in.
{114122}{114168}He'll need a shot.|- Ok.
{114317}{114413}Are you gonna do it now?|- Yep, right now.
{114423}{114479}I'll come back.|- Oh, it'll take a minute.
{114496}{114572}I hate shots.|I'll... come back tomorrow.
{114630}{114677}Trooper, put him up here on the table.
{114753}{114810}Where's Amber?|- Oh, she didn't want to watch.
{114815}{114856}Yeah, she's not used to this stuff.
{114858}{114921}It's just a pinch, ok, puppy?
{114927}{114972}Ouch.|- There we go.
{115023}{115085}You ok? You ok?|- He's fine.
{115100}{115176}Here he is. - There.|What do you think?
{115176}{115274}Ha-ha-ha. - Big.|You wanna feed him?
{115278}{115334}Sure.|- Grab a hold of that bucket there.
{115353}{115389}Here we go.|Come on around here.
{115406}{115448}Here we go.|Here we go.
{115489}{115565}Yeah, I'm gonna have to... have|somebody come out and
{115570}{115641}ride him this spring|so he don't get too frisky.
{115655}{115727}Don't suppose you know|anyone who'd be willing to do that.
{115763}{115819}I'd ride him, if I knew how.
{115823}{115899}You would?|- Yeah, if I knew how.
{115900}{115950}Well, now, here you go.
{115981}{116029}Who would thought that he would've|done that? Would you, Sam?
{116030}{116070}Never even crossed my mind.
{116076}{116165}But he's awful busy though, what with|being an assistant veterinarian and all.
{116165}{116216}Oh, yeah, he probably doesn't|even have time. - Not much.
{116221}{116262}Well, I'd have time...
{116276}{116370}It's just...|I don't really know how.
{116378}{116425}Oh, yeah.|Oh, I forgot about that.
{116445}{116479}Too bad.
{116539}{116592}Well, of course,|there's always Sophie.
{116618}{116722}Yeah, lots of folks learned to ride on|Sophie. - Sophie's very gentle.
{116722}{116802}Oh, is very gentle,|sort of like sitting in an easy chair.
{116845}{116936}Well...|I'll keep looking.
{117002}{117048}Hey, say, you know,
{117078}{117184}I just got an idea, now if you wanted|to come and learn on Sophie.
{117190}{117238}Yeah, I would.
{117238}{117298}Well, how about that|I think we got a deal?
{117301}{117356}Well, son of a gun, I wish|I'd thought of that before.
{117371}{117426}Well, you come on back anytime,|and we'll get started.
{117427}{117503}Ok.|- Ain't that somethin'?
{117520}{117569}Yeah, boy.
{117592}{117646}Never even thought|about ol' Trooper.

{121564}{121623}I bet it's the labor day picnic.
{121626}{121703}Maybe. Maybe not.
{121719}{121769}What's the big surprise, Sam?
{121795}{121849}It wouldn't be a suprise if I told you.
{121865}{121894}Now would it?
{122379}{122412}What do you think?
{122613}{122672}Sam, I didn't think that we could...|- I took a chance.
{122701}{122735}We've been working overtime.
{122737}{122795}I talked the guys|into coming in over the holidays.
{122797}{122841}Thanks, Rick.|- Ok.
{122846}{122904}All right, you, walk the plank.
{122932}{122966}Rick!
{123003}{123037}Thank you so much.
{123039}{123078}The guys wanted to help.|They're good guys.
{123084}{123136}Here we have living room.
{123163}{123243}Kitchen, bedroom,
{123260}{123295}family room.
{123403}{123433}I wanted you to see it.
{123495}{123533}Thank you, Sam.
{123542}{123582}In case it burns down again.
{123839}{123920}Will this be my room?|- It'll be all yours.
{123956}{123996}Do you want to put|a bunk bed in here?
{123996}{124038}Nah.
{124073}{124146}A single?|- Whatever you want.
{124215}{124292}I bet you'll be able to have|a really nice view of some stars.
{124304}{124336}Yeah,
{124381}{124422}it's a pretty nice view.
{124629}{124661}Hey.
{124741}{124783}Where at?|- Over there.
{124820}{124884}Why don't I see about fixing us|some supper? - That'd be great.
{124890}{124935}Aren't we gonna go to the town picnic?
{124947}{125011}I don't feel up to it, Troop.|I'm sorry.
{125013}{125054}Maybe you and I can stop by later.
{125063}{125099}That's a good idea.
{125109}{125214}Go into the kitchen and help Lydia.|There's some cold spaghetti in the fridge.
{125215}{125253}Ok.|Ok, go help her.
{125504}{125546}How much of this are you taking?
{125558}{125591}It's never enough.
{125613}{125644}You in a lot of pain?
{125661}{125695}I can manage.
{125762}{125813}Thank you for today, Sam.
{125838}{125891}I owe you so much.
{125895}{125951}Oh, I don't know about that.|I'd say we're pretty even,
{125962}{126074}and I don't just mean when we were kids.|I mean now as well.
{126091}{126155}You keep showing me|how to live my life.
{126183}{126251}You're doing just fine without me.
{126282}{126346}It's different without you.
{126445}{126483}You know I...
{126519}{126553}I never told you this.
{126595}{126659}But that night before you left,
{126693}{126776}we were sitting out on your porch.|- I know.
{126857}{126891}What?
{126902}{126975}You were gonna|give me your class ring.
{127111}{127153}How did you know that?
{127195}{127236}I just knew.
{127344}{127385}I didn't want to hurt you.
{127429}{127482}You mean so much to me.
{127537}{127576}I love you, Sam,
{127609}{127664}you and Lydia both.
{127774}{127809}Now, listen,
{127843}{127930}on that bookshelf|up underneath the basket,
{127938}{128008}there's a letter.|Would you get it for me?
{128176}{128213}Come here.
{128329}{128420}I want you to give this to|Trooper when you think he's ready.
{128445}{128507}I wrote him a letter|about his dad.
{128542}{128626}I always thought he should have|a dad he could believe in.
{128695}{128746}He has one now.
{129035}{129128}Oh, my gosh.|- What's that?
{129207}{129266}Dee Dee, Sam, you've got|to come check this out.
{129435}{129501}There she is!|- Hey!
{129561}{129654}We, uh... We figured you couldn't|make the picnic, Dee Dee, so
{129661}{129716}we decided to|bring the picnic to you.
{129721}{129841}*You just call out my name
{129841}{129961}*and you know wherever I am
{129966}{130061}*I'll come running
{130086}{130161}*to see you again
{130241}{130361}*winter, spring, summer, or fall
{130361}{130466}*all you gotta do is call
{130466}{130541}*and I'll be there
{130586}{130681}*you've got a friend
{130726}{130846}*winter, spring, summer, or fall
{130846}{130961}*all you gotta do is call
{130966}{131031}*and I'll be there
{131066}{131141}*you've got a friend
{131731}{131809}And so we turn to|the scripture passages just read,
{131818}{131881}and we look to the memory|of Dee Dee Mashow's life
{131881}{131937}for conciliation in our sorrow
{131940}{132005}and for inspiration in our lives.
{132019}{132128}And now, Dee Dee's son Trooper|has requested a moment.
{132614}{132642}When...
{132708}{132773}When my mom said|we were gonna move here,
{132802}{132866}I didn't really want to.
{132904}{132941}'Cause...
{132974}{133028}'cause I didn't really|know anybody then.
{133133}{133180}She said...
{133224}{133278}she said that this town was special.
{133315}{133367}I just hear a lot of stories about it.
{133402}{133480}But she said every place|we lived was special,
{133517}{133559}so I didn't|really believe her.
{133605}{133673}But I liked the stories anyways.
{133756}{133794}Now...
{133992}{134053}Now I see what she meant.
{134207}{134250}Wherever I go,
{134265}{134309}it reminds me of her.
{134363}{134409}It's like...
{134459}{134523}It's like she's still here.
{134774}{134869}I'm glad we came.|I'm glad.
{135402}{135492}*Amazing grace
{135492}{135582}*how sweet the sound
{135582}{135742}*that saved a wretch like me
{135762}{135862}*I once was lost
{135872}{135962}*but now am found
{135962}{136122}*'twas blind, but now I see
{136172}{136272}*'twas grace that taught
{136272}{136362}*my heart to fear
{136362}{136542}*and grace my fears relieved
{136562}{136662}*how precious did
{136662}{136762}*that grace appear
{136762}{136952}*the hour I first believed
{136992}{137202}*through many dangers,|toils, and snares
{137202}{137412}*I have already come
{137422}{137642}*'tis grace hath brought|me safe thus far
{137642}{137872}*and grace will|lead me home
