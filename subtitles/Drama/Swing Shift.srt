1
00:02:33,922 --> 00:02:36,482
- Hi, Spike. How are you?
- Hi, Jack.

2
00:02:36,558 --> 00:02:38,423
She sounds good today.

3
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:51,538
Come on, boy.

4
00:02:54,943 --> 00:02:55,967
Hi, spike.

5
00:02:56,044 --> 00:02:57,739
- Hi, Kay.
- Seen Jack?

6
00:02:57,812 --> 00:02:59,609
Yeah, he's out front.

7
00:03:02,817 --> 00:03:04,717
Wesley, get over here.

8
00:03:11,893 --> 00:03:13,690
How you doing, Ethel?

9
00:03:14,262 --> 00:03:16,594
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, honey. How are you?

10
00:03:16,665 --> 00:03:20,101
Good. Hope you're hungry.

11
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:21,968
I'm starving.

12
00:03:23,205 --> 00:03:25,002
Think you can make that any louder?

13
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:39,412
- Busy day, honey?
- The same old stuff, sweetheart.

14
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,325
How cheap can you get?

15
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:50,724
Tramp!

16
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:55,400
- I think she's a singer.
- Singer, my foot.

17
00:03:58,473 --> 00:04:00,941
Saturdays are rotten when you work.

18
00:04:02,277 --> 00:04:05,007
Tell that to the bill collectors, honey.

19
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:07,941
Free enterprise is killing me.

20
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:12,002
- I can't make a dime in that dump.
- I know, babe. My feet are killing me.

21
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,140
We'll settle down with a business.
Doing something decent.

22
00:05:15,216 --> 00:05:17,810
I'm going to sell the Egyptian. It's a curse.

23
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:24,853
There's got to be something else
I can do besides run a cheap dance hall.

24
00:05:29,364 --> 00:05:32,333
Biscuits, honey, coming in or what?

25
00:06:09,037 --> 00:06:12,063
There's fine smoking pleasure
in fine tobacco...

26
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:16,440
and lucky strike means fine tobacco.
So round, so firm...

27
00:06:19,948 --> 00:06:22,644
he said, "Do you want the job?"

28
00:06:26,154 --> 00:06:29,521
- Want a balloon?
- Thank you.

29
00:06:32,293 --> 00:06:35,626
It's a war! We're at war!
The goddamn Japs bombed Hawaii!

30
00:06:36,631 --> 00:06:39,566
The Japanese have attacked
Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, by air...

31
00:06:39,634 --> 00:06:41,693
President Roosevelt has just announced.

32
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,739
The attack also was made
on naval and military activities...

33
00:06:44,806 --> 00:06:47,070
in the principal islands of Oahu.

34
00:06:49,444 --> 00:06:51,742
I have a boy at sea on a destroyer.

35
00:06:52,547 --> 00:06:55,539
For alll know,
he may be on his way to the pacific.

36
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,781
- Two of my children are in...
- Mrs. Roosevelt's son's on a destroyer.

37
00:06:59,854 --> 00:07:02,015
Many of you all over this country...

38
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:05,082
have boys in the services
who now will be called upon...

39
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,924
this american's going to die
with perfect nails.

40
00:07:11,566 --> 00:07:15,593
- You cannot escape things.
- Ethel, hand me that hammer.

41
00:07:19,007 --> 00:07:22,568
I'm telling you, the light's
going to show through that thing.

42
00:07:23,178 --> 00:07:26,739
They said this is how you're supposed
to do it on the radio, hon.

43
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:31,485
I don't think
it's going to do a bit of good, sweetheart.

44
00:07:32,086 --> 00:07:36,045
- You're probably right.
- Let me give you some help.

45
00:07:36,224 --> 00:07:38,089
There. I did it, Jack.

46
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:42,619
I'm going to get you another beer.

47
00:07:44,365 --> 00:07:48,358
I'm signing up tomorrow. I've got to.

48
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:53,905
I knew you were going to say that.

49
00:07:56,377 --> 00:07:59,369
Honey, snap out of it, will you?

50
00:08:04,619 --> 00:08:07,747
Pearl harbor's one thing,
but the japs aren't going to land here.

51
00:08:07,822 --> 00:08:09,449
How do you know?

52
00:08:12,193 --> 00:08:16,789
First of all, the fishing's been real lousy
off santa monica pier this year.

53
00:08:18,132 --> 00:08:20,999
Second of all, I won't let them.

54
00:08:22,737 --> 00:08:26,173
- What if something happens to you?
- Listen to me, Kay.

55
00:08:26,441 --> 00:08:28,466
Nothing's going to happen to me.

56
00:08:31,346 --> 00:08:33,075
But I've got to go.

57
00:08:33,348 --> 00:08:36,840
Damn it, they started it.
We've got to finish it. We've got to.

58
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:38,408
I've got to go.

59
00:08:38,553 --> 00:08:40,851
- It will be all right.
- Promise?

60
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:43,388
I promise.

61
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,018
Now, let's see.

62
00:08:47,161 --> 00:08:50,392
A seaman third makes $18.75 a month,
plus $5.00 sea duty.

63
00:08:50,465 --> 00:08:53,559
That's $23.75 I can send you home
every month.

64
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:59,167
Prices might go up because of the war,
so be careful how you spend it. Okay?

65
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,734
- I was thinking I could take something on.
- Like what?

66
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:08,313
A job. Penney's is looking for salesgirls...

67
00:09:08,383 --> 00:09:11,011
I don't want you doing any such thing.

68
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:16,546
I don't want you working.
I just want you to be safe.

69
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,790
What am I going to do if I don't have you
to do things for anymore?

70
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:37,242
That lid sure is swell on you, Kay.

71
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:40,748
I bought it to see you off.
I know you like red.

72
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:45,415
- Yeah, I like red.
- Section five, move out!

73
00:09:48,323 --> 00:09:51,121
I don't know what I'm going to do
without you, honey.

74
00:09:51,192 --> 00:09:52,989
God, me neither, Kay.

75
00:09:55,797 --> 00:09:57,526
Section five, let's move.

76
00:10:02,904 --> 00:10:04,599
Bye, Jack!

77
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:17,671
I said to myself, "Frankie Parker,
you better get out of here...

78
00:11:17,745 --> 00:11:20,714
"if you ever want to be somebody."

79
00:11:22,383 --> 00:11:24,248
You sing real nice.

80
00:11:24,552 --> 00:11:27,988
- Thank you.
- My unit's shipping out tomorrow.

81
00:11:28,456 --> 00:11:29,616
No fooling.

82
00:11:32,794 --> 00:11:35,854
Here. Find yourself another girl, okay?

83
00:11:36,064 --> 00:11:37,531
Good luck, sweetie.

84
00:11:41,903 --> 00:11:44,963
Biscuits, you said
I could sing tonight, remember?

85
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:47,439
I got to get a big name up there.

86
00:11:47,575 --> 00:11:50,635
What do you mean, a big name?
You said I could sing tonight.

87
00:11:50,712 --> 00:11:52,304
I got a gold mine here.

88
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,814
This could be a first-class hall
if I play it right.

89
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:59,683
I'm talking helen forrest, ginny simms,
jo stafford. Not Hazel zanussi.

90
00:12:00,421 --> 00:12:04,050
- Know who goes dancing during a war?
- No. Tell me.

91
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:08,185
- Everybody.
- Biscuits, you told me...

92
00:12:08,696 --> 00:12:11,563
- here you go, boss.
- Thank you, knuckles.

93
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:25,475
- She takes a good picture, doesn't she?
- Jesus!

94
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:30,848
So the girls go for me. Is that my fault?

95
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:34,351
No, I just thought that you and I
were going to get respectable.

96
00:12:34,422 --> 00:12:37,721
- Remember that?
- It's finished. Satisfied?

97
00:12:37,992 --> 00:12:40,620
Now, haven't you got something to do?

98
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:44,596
I sure do.

99
00:12:56,244 --> 00:12:59,771
Women wanted for war production work
here in our city.

100
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:01,475
Why?

101
00:13:01,816 --> 00:13:04,876
More and more men are being called
into the armed forces.

102
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:07,944
Their jobs must be filled, and filled now.

103
00:13:08,055 --> 00:13:11,718
And who can fill them? You. You women.

104
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:15,955
You're the ones who must fill them,
who can give our boys what they need.

105
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:20,533
A thousand more planes.

106
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:24,634
More and more tanks, and more ships.

107
00:13:37,218 --> 00:13:38,515
Good afternoon.

108
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,948
Malcolm Macbride,
from my battle station to yours.

109
00:13:42,657 --> 00:13:46,286
I want to take this opportunity
to welcome all the many new associates...

110
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,796
to the Macbride aircraft company
here in santa monica.

111
00:13:50,498 --> 00:13:52,796
We are engaged
in a great world struggle...

112
00:13:52,867 --> 00:13:55,563
to maintain our american way of life
as we know it.

113
00:13:56,304 --> 00:14:00,104
The contributions you make at Macbride
will ensure our victory.

114
00:14:00,408 --> 00:14:04,344
Again, welcome,
from my battle station to yours.

115
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:07,407
They got some pretty tight spaces
on those bombers.

116
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:10,746
You'd be good at that.
Are they asking for references?

117
00:14:10,818 --> 00:14:14,515
You're breathing. That's good enough
for them. They're using everybody.

118
00:14:17,658 --> 00:14:21,025
"My dearest darling, I love you.

119
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:23,857
"I miss you so much I can hardly stand it."

120
00:14:23,965 --> 00:14:26,593
I've just got to get this job.
Believe me, I do.

121
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:30,467
- I believe you.
- I've got a kid to feed. Her name is Peggy.

122
00:14:30,538 --> 00:14:32,028
Isn't she sweet.

123
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,673
My husband would kill me
if he knew what I was doing.

124
00:14:35,743 --> 00:14:37,734
I'm Violet Mulligan.

125
00:14:38,012 --> 00:14:39,502
Over here!

126
00:14:47,521 --> 00:14:50,752
- You gotta have your high school diploma.
- I've got it...

127
00:14:50,825 --> 00:14:54,488
Attention, new employees.
Long hair is dangerous.

128
00:14:54,896 --> 00:14:58,297
So for safety's sake,
cut your hair or wear a hair net.

129
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,700
- Swing shift, 60 cents an hour.
- Swing shift?

130
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:04,796
Swing shift: 4:00 to midnight. Okay?

131
00:15:05,106 --> 00:15:07,267
- Great.
- Here's your diploma.

132
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:11,667
Here's your handbook.
Please read it thoroughly. Next, please.

133
00:15:13,214 --> 00:15:15,409
- Small world.
- Tiny.

134
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:19,646
- We're neighbors. The Balmy Palm.
- Yeah, I know who you are.

135
00:15:20,388 --> 00:15:23,050
I thought we could go home together.

136
00:15:24,558 --> 00:15:28,756
You've got a lot of nerve, you know that?
Every time I walk past your place...

137
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:31,730
all you and your husband can do
is make wisecracks about me.

138
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:35,030
What the hell do you think I am?
Deaf, dumb, and blind?

139
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:44,874
This itty-bitty thing is not a thumbtack.
It's what we call a rivet.

140
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:49,011
And this is a rivet gun.

141
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:54,217
But we don't want you
shooting anybody with it, do we, boys?

142
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:12,736
Get serious here for a moment.
Riveting is real suited to you gals...

143
00:16:13,441 --> 00:16:16,410
because women
are used to repetitive tasks.

144
00:16:17,378 --> 00:16:21,178
Believe me, ladies,
as strange as all this may seem...

145
00:16:21,816 --> 00:16:24,376
after training,
you'll use these tools as easily...

146
00:16:24,452 --> 00:16:27,512
as you would a can opener
or a sewing machine needle at home.

147
00:16:37,365 --> 00:16:39,595
- Those are your skinners.
- What?

148
00:16:41,402 --> 00:16:44,735
Your skinners. Your reamer.

149
00:16:45,906 --> 00:16:47,965
- Your bucker-upper.
- Right.

150
00:16:49,677 --> 00:16:50,905
Come on.

151
00:16:56,784 --> 00:16:59,810
Here. Hit it.

152
00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:04,956
Very good.

153
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:12,958
Very good. Let's do a couple more.

154
00:17:13,401 --> 00:17:16,029
- I think I learned it.
- Okay.

155
00:17:25,913 --> 00:17:28,746
My god! What have I done?

156
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:31,082
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

157
00:17:31,152 --> 00:17:32,414
Listen to her!

158
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,451
- It's all right.
- Sure, it's ladies' day.

159
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:40,057
- Bull's eye.
- I could have gone right through you!

160
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:42,192
It's all right.

161
00:17:45,466 --> 00:17:47,491
Come on, let's go outside.

162
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:54,298
I'm your leadman.

163
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:57,276
Just take a deep breath
and you'll get your confidence back.

164
00:18:00,081 --> 00:18:01,378
Okay.

165
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,575
Maybe I just should've stayed at home.

166
00:18:04,652 --> 00:18:08,713
Oh, balls. Look, you... I mean... I'm sorry.

167
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:12,723
That's okay. My husband used to say that
all the time, "Oh, balls."

168
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:16,862
- It's okay.
- Is he dead?

169
00:18:17,765 --> 00:18:18,754
No.

170
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:21,066
You okay?

171
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,133
- Yeah. I'm fine, thanks.
- I'm going to watch you for a while.

172
00:18:26,207 --> 00:18:29,142
When you get nervous,
you can hurt yourself.

173
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,978
Okay, thank you. Thanks a lot.

174
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:35,677
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

175
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:48,750
Hey, moon!

176
00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:41,273
Darn it.

177
00:19:42,316 --> 00:19:43,943
Move it or lose it, toots!

178
00:19:44,018 --> 00:19:45,849
- I missed my bus.
- Tough.

179
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,054
Yeah, that would've been
about 20 minutes ago.

180
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:07,302
- You need a lift?
- In that?

181
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:10,266
It's all I got.

182
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:14,571
You sure get tired by the end of the day.

183
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:21,951
- That's my trumpet.
- I'm sorry.

184
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:25,883
Hold on.

185
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:37,769
I bought it from a guy
who went to the army.

186
00:20:37,838 --> 00:20:39,863
My husband's in the navy.

187
00:20:42,042 --> 00:20:43,373
Oh, boy.

188
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:45,000
Hi.

189
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:05,095
We made it.

190
00:21:05,633 --> 00:21:08,101
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Bright and early.

191
00:21:08,168 --> 00:21:11,228
4:00 p.m. It's all so turned around, isn't it?

192
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:15,033
- My name's lucky.
- Kay walsh.

193
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:16,133
All the above.

194
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,872
Lucky, that's a funny name.
How did you get it?

195
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:21,779
I better not tell you. It's kind of dirty.

196
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,115
Evening, Mrs. Walsh.

197
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,451
- You just stick with it, Kay.
- I will. Thanks.

198
00:21:29,523 --> 00:21:32,048
Guess what, spike? I'm working now!

199
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,275
What are you doing? You're crazy!

200
00:21:55,082 --> 00:21:58,347
Hazel, what are you doing?
There's only perverts out at this hour.

201
00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:00,080
Get out of my way!

202
00:22:01,522 --> 00:22:02,648
You okay?

203
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:12,829
I think the bike's messed up. Look at it.

204
00:22:14,935 --> 00:22:16,562
I'll give you a ride home.

205
00:22:18,205 --> 00:22:21,971
If you don't leave at the count of five,
I'm calling the cops.

206
00:22:23,043 --> 00:22:27,878
- One, two, three...
- you're making a big mistake.

207
00:22:27,948 --> 00:22:29,176
...four...

208
00:23:26,507 --> 00:23:30,273
- quit that racket!
- What's going on out here?

209
00:23:32,246 --> 00:23:35,477
Are you all right? What happened?

210
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:38,143
- What the hell is going on?
- It's nothing, spike.

211
00:23:38,218 --> 00:23:41,210
It's not the japs or anything.
Just go back to bed.

212
00:23:55,436 --> 00:23:57,199
I like your hair.

213
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,673
Thank you.

214
00:24:02,142 --> 00:24:04,372
Jack would have a heart attack
if he saw me.

215
00:24:04,445 --> 00:24:06,879
- Who's Jack?
- My husband.

216
00:24:08,482 --> 00:24:10,712
Right. Mr. Personality.

217
00:24:13,754 --> 00:24:17,781
- I should go home.
- Wait. I made this for you.

218
00:24:27,534 --> 00:24:30,002
My name is Kay. What's your name?

219
00:24:31,872 --> 00:24:33,772
- Hazel.
- Hazel?

220
00:24:34,074 --> 00:24:35,803
Yeah. It's my mom's name.

221
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:40,676
I'd watch you go to work all the time
just to see what new outfit you'd wear.

222
00:24:41,281 --> 00:24:42,475
Thanks.

223
00:24:43,183 --> 00:24:44,707
Are you a singer?

224
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,621
- What is this?
- Hot milk.

225
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,088
- Yeah, I'm a singer.
- I knew it.

226
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,462
Didn't even tell Biscuits about my new job.

227
00:24:59,533 --> 00:25:03,299
- Biscuits?
- Just some guy I used to know.

228
00:25:08,108 --> 00:25:11,168
- It's Jack, in uniform.
- Right.

229
00:25:15,282 --> 00:25:18,513
If he knew where I was working,
he'd wouldn't believe it.

230
00:25:18,585 --> 00:25:20,576
He'd never picture me
riveting and drilling...

231
00:25:20,654 --> 00:25:22,383
riding motorcycles.

232
00:25:25,459 --> 00:25:26,721
I needed a ride.

233
00:25:26,793 --> 00:25:29,956
- It's none of my beeswax.
- I didn't do anything wrong.

234
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,861
All right, I'm not your husband.

235
00:25:31,932 --> 00:25:35,390
- It was just a ride, and that was all.
- All right! Jesus.

236
00:25:38,405 --> 00:25:42,068
I guess I better get going.
Got to work tomorrow.

237
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:50,979
You got a little mustache.

238
00:25:57,491 --> 00:26:00,119
- Don't worry about that guy.
- What guy?

239
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:04,053
The one you used to know.
You'll find somebody else.

240
00:26:09,436 --> 00:26:10,926
See you later.

241
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:25,081
Almost five months
since entering the war...

242
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,677
- the government has proved...
- over there.

243
00:26:28,355 --> 00:26:29,947
There's a space.

244
00:26:34,561 --> 00:26:36,290
What are you doing?

245
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:42,027
Buddy, who the hell do you think you are?

246
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:44,400
I'm going to tell you who I am.
I'm moon willis.

247
00:26:44,471 --> 00:26:47,338
I've worked at this damn place
for 12 long years.

248
00:26:47,407 --> 00:26:49,807
This is my parking space.
I ain't about to lose it...

249
00:26:49,876 --> 00:26:52,367
to a bunch of fly-by-night women like you.

250
00:26:59,286 --> 00:27:01,777
You don't belong here, none of you!

251
00:27:04,858 --> 00:27:06,052
What's his trouble?

252
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:08,754
We were just coming in here.
I saw that parking place...

253
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:11,195
and then he pulled in...

254
00:27:14,234 --> 00:27:17,726
- you haven't quit yet.
- No. We have to win the war, don't we?

255
00:27:17,838 --> 00:27:21,103
I just try to pay the bills
and stay out of trouble, myself.

256
00:27:33,854 --> 00:27:37,847
- What's troubling you?
- I'd like a left-handed lock wire plier.

257
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:41,850
Lou, we got another patsy!

258
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:45,598
Stick out your left hand.

259
00:27:48,268 --> 00:27:51,328
There. Now you got
a left-hand lock wire plier.

260
00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:54,130
- Got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

261
00:27:54,207 --> 00:27:55,572
Now remember it.

262
00:27:57,044 --> 00:27:58,944
All you gotta say is, "listen, you big ape.

263
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:01,845
"You ever pull that on me again,
I'll slap your ears off."

264
00:28:02,315 --> 00:28:05,341
"Listen, you big ape."

265
00:28:06,286 --> 00:28:08,413
Back to work, ladies.

266
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,781
Listen, you big, fat ape!

267
00:28:12,726 --> 00:28:13,715
Yeah.

268
00:28:18,665 --> 00:28:21,691
- Where's my left-hand lock wire pliers?
- Listen here...

269
00:28:21,768 --> 00:28:23,292
- Listen?
- You big...

270
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,964
- big what?
- Big fat...

271
00:29:03,043 --> 00:29:04,670
She's so gorgeous.

272
00:29:04,778 --> 00:29:05,938
Have a seat.

273
00:29:09,883 --> 00:29:11,043
Sorry.

274
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,915
- Thank you.
- Hi.

275
00:29:15,555 --> 00:29:18,615
- How you doing?
- The days are getting longer.

276
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,285
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

277
00:29:22,462 --> 00:29:24,987
- What did you say it for?
- I don't know.

278
00:29:25,198 --> 00:29:27,530
You seem a little uncomfortable.

279
00:29:28,401 --> 00:29:30,096
Where's your motorcycle?

280
00:29:30,203 --> 00:29:32,728
I'm taking my poke at hitler. Saving gas.

281
00:29:32,973 --> 00:29:34,463
Where are you from, Kay?

282
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:38,102
We're from lowa,
my husband Jack and me.

283
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:42,776
I'm playing my horn tonight.
You want to come hear me?

284
00:29:43,683 --> 00:29:46,277
- No. I have a million things to do.
- I'm not bad.

285
00:29:46,353 --> 00:29:49,914
- It's a cute little place, next corner.
- No. I have to write Jack a letter.

286
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,550
- And I have a lot to do.
- I understand.

287
00:29:53,426 --> 00:29:56,657
So what about you? You like good music?

288
00:29:57,097 --> 00:29:58,587
- You addressing me?
- Correct.

289
00:29:58,665 --> 00:30:01,225
You're barking up the wrong tree, mister.

290
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:04,793
My mother always said someday
I'd meet a wonderful girl like you.

291
00:30:04,871 --> 00:30:06,668
See you tomorrow, Kay.

292
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,805
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

293
00:30:29,729 --> 00:30:32,994
...taking us one step closer
to the big victory!

294
00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:34,556
Okay!

295
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:59,074
- Talk to you a minute, Kay?
- Sure.

296
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,814
- Some guys can't take "no" for an answer.
- Yeah, I know.

297
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,084
You said it.

298
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:13,222
I think our line is moving really fast,
don't you?

299
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,927
Last chance, Kay.

300
00:32:15,235 --> 00:32:19,228
Kelly's, saturday night.
Lucky lockhart and his hot jazz trumpet.

301
00:32:22,142 --> 00:32:23,973
It's great working with you...

302
00:32:24,044 --> 00:32:27,207
and I think you're the best leadman
on the line...

303
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:30,611
and I just know you're a swell fellow.

304
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:37,515
But you've been asking me out every week
for the last five months...

305
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,820
and I keep having to turn you down.

306
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:43,527
People are beginning to talk.

307
00:32:45,065 --> 00:32:48,364
I'm just trying to improve
your taste in music, Kay.

308
00:32:50,837 --> 00:32:53,533
But you won't
have to turn me down again.

309
00:32:58,411 --> 00:33:01,346
Don't be late or I'll dock you, Mrs. Walsh.

310
00:33:21,468 --> 00:33:23,197
Attention, please.

311
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:26,664
We have just received news
of another tragic loss.

312
00:33:27,674 --> 00:33:30,541
The Japanese have sunk the USS Carrier Hornet...

313
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:32,237
defending guadalcanal.

314
00:33:32,912 --> 00:33:35,779
I know many of you swing shifters
have husbands...

315
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:38,443
sons, and sweethearts on guadalcanal.

316
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:41,483
We must work harder to help turn the tide.

317
00:33:41,554 --> 00:33:43,021
Signing off.

318
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:09,706
If he asks me out tonight,
I'll tell him not to bother me anymore.

319
00:34:09,783 --> 00:34:11,273
It's up to you.

320
00:34:12,085 --> 00:34:15,384
Maybe you could come along,
just to keep things safe.

321
00:34:18,058 --> 00:34:21,186
Why not? Come on.
What're you gonna do?

322
00:34:21,261 --> 00:34:23,889
You're off tomorrow.
You're gonna sit at home?

323
00:34:23,963 --> 00:34:26,989
I thought I could whip up
a batch of victory fudge.

324
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:30,332
Look, honey, you don't need me.
I got faith in you.

325
00:34:32,072 --> 00:34:33,061
You do?

326
00:34:33,807 --> 00:34:34,796
Sure.

327
00:34:39,813 --> 00:34:41,804
I really like you, Hazel.

328
00:34:42,482 --> 00:34:43,642
A lot.

329
00:34:45,051 --> 00:34:47,815
- Gee, Kay, I really like you, too.
- No, I really like you...

330
00:34:47,887 --> 00:34:50,583
All right, don't get sentimental on me.

331
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:05,996
- You wanted to tell me something?
- Thank you.

332
00:35:11,444 --> 00:35:16,040
- I think you're a swell guy.
- I think you are terrific.

333
00:35:18,852 --> 00:35:22,913
You know, there are a lot of great girls
at the plant.

334
00:35:22,989 --> 00:35:26,083
- Millions.
- Single gals.

335
00:35:26,759 --> 00:35:28,784
Lots of them, too. So?

336
00:35:34,901 --> 00:35:37,392
Spike and Ethel, my landlords.

337
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:40,299
What's the matter?

338
00:35:41,207 --> 00:35:42,674
What's wrong?

339
00:35:44,277 --> 00:35:45,869
- Kay?
- Sorry.

340
00:35:46,946 --> 00:35:48,914
- Wait a minute.
- Excuse me.

341
00:35:50,183 --> 00:35:51,775
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

342
00:35:51,851 --> 00:35:54,217
What're you doing? Wait a minute.

343
00:35:59,759 --> 00:36:00,885
Taxi!

344
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:07,564
Excuse me.

345
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:10,299
- Wait a minute!
- I can't...

346
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:13,100
- what the hell...
- I can't. I'm married.

347
00:36:14,641 --> 00:36:17,405
- So what? So that's it?
- It's wrong.

348
00:36:17,477 --> 00:36:18,671
Come on, Kay.

349
00:36:18,745 --> 00:36:21,942
It's your own life.
You've got a right to be happy.

350
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:23,243
I can't.

351
00:36:24,951 --> 00:36:27,647
I'm married. Don't you understand that?

352
00:36:30,056 --> 00:36:31,683
Don't you get it?

353
00:36:38,731 --> 00:36:39,959
Please...

354
00:36:41,601 --> 00:36:42,932
go away.

355
00:36:51,177 --> 00:36:53,577
- Come on, I'll give you a ride home.
- No.

356
00:36:53,646 --> 00:36:56,740
Come on, Kay.
Just come out of the alley.

357
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:02,811
Suit yourself.

358
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:18,128
Kay, Hazel, look!
I got another letter from al.

359
00:37:18,204 --> 00:37:19,865
And it's only two months old.

360
00:37:19,939 --> 00:37:23,602
If you had me to keep you company
you wouldn't need vitamins.

361
00:37:23,676 --> 00:37:27,635
All these guys think they're god's gift,
every last one of them.

362
00:37:28,248 --> 00:37:31,081
- Sweetie, it's always been that way.
- You're right.

363
00:37:33,152 --> 00:37:34,244
There she is.

364
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,049
Mrs. Sherman. Ladies.

365
00:37:41,227 --> 00:37:43,422
Are you Mrs. Jeannie sherman?

366
00:37:44,163 --> 00:37:45,152
Yes.

367
00:37:45,665 --> 00:37:49,294
The wife of cpl. Albert sherman,
glendale, california?

368
00:37:52,505 --> 00:37:54,871
I'm sorry to inform you that...

369
00:38:05,652 --> 00:38:07,142
- Oh, god.
- I'm sorry.

370
00:38:08,721 --> 00:38:10,848
I've never done this before.

371
00:38:22,502 --> 00:38:23,901
Associates...

372
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:27,997
Congratulations for having surpassed
our 1942 quota.

373
00:38:28,908 --> 00:38:32,469
Celebrate a good year's work
at the swing shift jamboree.

374
00:38:33,313 --> 00:38:35,975
Remember, the swing shift jamboree...

375
00:38:36,516 --> 00:38:39,280
this saturday night
at the egyptian ballroom.

376
00:38:44,357 --> 00:38:46,689
United States Naval Forces
have destroyed...

377
00:38:46,759 --> 00:38:49,660
twenty-three Japanese warships
and transports...

378
00:38:49,996 --> 00:38:52,658
peewee, where did you get that dress?

379
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:54,497
The museum?

380
00:38:56,736 --> 00:38:58,260
No good?

381
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:02,330
You got a swell shape, sweetheart.
Why are you afraid to show it?

382
00:39:02,408 --> 00:39:06,037
- Jack doesn't like revealing things.
- So? Let him wear it.

383
00:39:08,514 --> 00:39:13,042
- I don't want to go to the dance anyway.
- Good. Me neither.

384
00:39:13,653 --> 00:39:16,645
- You like it up or down?
- I like it up.

385
00:39:20,426 --> 00:39:23,657
That's the war news tonight,
for November 17.

386
00:39:24,497 --> 00:39:28,763
I just thought since it's down the street,
you know, that little place...

387
00:39:29,736 --> 00:39:31,670
The Egyptian Ballroom?

388
00:39:32,071 --> 00:39:35,302
I've had it with that place.
I wouldn't be caught dead there.

389
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:38,674
Me, either. Dumb idea.

390
00:39:39,145 --> 00:39:41,010
The egyptian ballroom.

391
00:39:42,048 --> 00:39:43,913
Swing shift jamboree.

392
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:46,784
Stupid. God.

393
00:39:48,354 --> 00:39:51,152
We could just stay home
and do something.

394
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:52,483
Sure.

395
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,533
We could clean out your kitchen drawers.

396
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:06,370
Sure. We could do that.

397
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:14,068
They'll probably think
we're stuck-up for not going.

398
00:40:14,147 --> 00:40:16,342
- So?
- Who cares?

399
00:40:16,549 --> 00:40:18,141
- I don't care.
- I know.

400
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:20,845
Okay.

401
00:40:21,521 --> 00:40:23,011
Got any aces?

402
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:29,794
Are you absolutely sure
you don't want to go?

403
00:40:32,498 --> 00:40:34,056
That dress looks ridiculous.

404
00:40:34,133 --> 00:40:36,226
- It does?
- We'll work on it.

405
00:40:36,436 --> 00:40:38,028
I'll fix you up.

406
00:40:41,507 --> 00:40:43,031
I'm getting it!

407
00:41:00,393 --> 00:41:02,054
- Hi, Hazel.
- How are you doing?

408
00:41:02,128 --> 00:41:04,995
- I thought you'd never make it.
- Come on!

409
00:41:05,998 --> 00:41:09,024
- Who's the new girl?
- Not right now, okay? Later.

410
00:41:15,575 --> 00:41:17,634
Honey, is this check okay?

411
00:41:18,778 --> 00:41:20,871
- Care to dance?
- Yeah, sure.

412
00:42:10,029 --> 00:42:13,931
I didn't think I was ever gonna
see you again, but you show up.

413
00:42:14,901 --> 00:42:18,337
Here we are back at the egyptian,
just like old times.

414
00:42:22,275 --> 00:42:25,369
- I knew I shouldn't have come here.
- Not true.

415
00:42:26,479 --> 00:42:29,277
You're got to see
what fate has in store for you.

416
00:42:29,348 --> 00:42:33,216
'Cause just when you think you're through
and life has got you beat...

417
00:42:33,452 --> 00:42:36,421
it comes right back to you,
stronger than ever.

418
00:42:38,457 --> 00:42:41,654
And everything's good again. Just like us.

419
00:42:46,098 --> 00:42:48,658
I came here tonight
to be with my friends, Biscuits.

420
00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:50,793
There's plenty of nice guys at the plant...

421
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:53,498
we have swell times.
And you don't look so beat to me.

422
00:42:53,573 --> 00:42:54,938
This place is doing great.

423
00:42:55,007 --> 00:42:58,670
You probably got all the money
and the girls you can handle.

424
00:42:58,978 --> 00:43:02,971
- What you've always wanted, isn't it?
- It's what I always wanted.

425
00:43:03,049 --> 00:43:07,213
Why don't you go on inside
and enjoy yourself with your new friends?

426
00:43:08,421 --> 00:43:12,380
I think I'd like to just finish my cigarette,
if you don't mind.

427
00:43:16,329 --> 00:43:20,766
Someday I'm going to do something
that'll surprise you. You wait and see.

428
00:44:42,548 --> 00:44:45,415
I don't know much about music,
but you were just terrific.

429
00:44:45,484 --> 00:44:49,318
Thanks. I really am a musician.
I'm not a mechanic.

430
00:44:49,789 --> 00:44:53,987
- Working at Macbride's is killing me.
- Why aren't you in the service?

431
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:01,491
- I'm a jap spy.
- Aren't you ever serious about anything?

432
00:45:02,268 --> 00:45:04,065
What is there to be serious about?

433
00:45:04,136 --> 00:45:07,867
Everything. The war, the nazis...

434
00:45:08,674 --> 00:45:10,369
winston churchill.

435
00:45:15,748 --> 00:45:18,842
I think you look prettier
without all that stuff.

436
00:45:19,151 --> 00:45:21,551
You're too good-looking for that.

437
00:45:37,803 --> 00:45:39,794
Do you want a ride home?

438
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,019
Get inside. I'm getting wet.

439
00:46:03,362 --> 00:46:05,091
Gosh, I'm freezing.

440
00:46:06,198 --> 00:46:07,358
And I'm starving.

441
00:46:07,433 --> 00:46:09,264
- That's not all.
- What else am I?

442
00:46:09,335 --> 00:46:11,599
- For one thing, you're all wet.
- I know.

443
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:14,332
Your make-up's probably
in your nylons by now.

444
00:46:14,807 --> 00:46:18,402
- What did you think I was going to say?
- Nothing.

445
00:46:18,711 --> 00:46:22,238
You know me better than that.
I'd have made an unacceptable suggestion.

446
00:46:22,314 --> 00:46:25,408
Come on, you always do that to me.
What's your suggestion?

447
00:46:25,484 --> 00:46:27,918
I happen to make the best cheese omelet
in the world.

448
00:46:27,987 --> 00:46:30,478
- Change your clothes.
- How about you?

449
00:46:30,556 --> 00:46:32,183
Change into what?

450
00:46:34,827 --> 00:46:36,988
- This?
- Forget it.

451
00:46:37,396 --> 00:46:38,624
Or this?

452
00:46:38,764 --> 00:46:42,530
- I'll catch pneumonia first.
- It's this or this. Take your choice.

453
00:46:44,069 --> 00:46:47,402
- How much longer? I'm starving.
- Hold on another minute.

454
00:46:47,473 --> 00:46:49,566
- Why?
- Here's why.

455
00:46:53,379 --> 00:46:55,472
Lucky, you're pretty good.

456
00:46:55,848 --> 00:46:58,146
Stop it. It's just a little something
I whipped up.

457
00:46:58,217 --> 00:47:02,085
- You do this to me all the time.
- Lucky, the things you do.

458
00:47:03,489 --> 00:47:06,185
- How about a little supper music?
- Sure.

459
00:47:14,667 --> 00:47:15,964
Skylark.

460
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:19,298
No good?

461
00:47:19,705 --> 00:47:23,300
No, it's okay. I just play it a lot
when I'm alone, that's all.

462
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,942
Too loud?

463
00:47:47,666 --> 00:47:49,327
Do you know this?

464
00:47:55,875 --> 00:47:58,742
This old mouthpiece.
It's getting hard to hit the high notes.

465
00:47:58,811 --> 00:48:00,540
No excuses. Really.

466
00:48:02,748 --> 00:48:04,613
Aren't you gonna eat?

467
00:48:06,218 --> 00:48:07,651
In a minute.

468
00:48:09,588 --> 00:48:12,421
I looked all over for you at the jamboree.

469
00:48:13,692 --> 00:48:16,024
Never did get to dance with you.

470
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:18,990
Would you like to?

471
00:48:32,111 --> 00:48:34,511
Did you meet Jack in high school?

472
00:48:36,148 --> 00:48:38,378
Four-year letter man. In what?

473
00:48:40,152 --> 00:48:42,780
Basketball, baseball, track, football.

474
00:48:43,756 --> 00:48:46,919
- He was quite an athlete.
- He still is, I'm sure.

475
00:49:37,209 --> 00:49:39,939
How come you never asked me
if I was 4f?

476
00:49:40,813 --> 00:49:42,280
I don't know.

477
00:49:43,082 --> 00:49:46,108
Just in case
you ever wondered about it, I am.

478
00:49:47,553 --> 00:49:49,521
The army turned me down.

479
00:49:50,155 --> 00:49:52,749
- I flunked my physical.
- I'm sorry.

480
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:55,119
Don't be. It's not worth it.

481
00:49:55,861 --> 00:49:58,887
I'm not sick. I'm just 4f.

482
00:50:00,466 --> 00:50:04,300
- 4f, that's all.
- It's not like they called you a dirty name.

483
00:50:05,571 --> 00:50:06,833
It isn't.

484
00:50:08,941 --> 00:50:12,240
Skip it. If it hadn't have been for the war...

485
00:50:12,311 --> 00:50:15,508
nobody would have said a thing
about my bad heart.

486
00:50:15,614 --> 00:50:17,878
Besides, it doesn't bother me.

487
00:50:20,219 --> 00:50:22,016
Yeah, I can see that.

488
00:50:23,789 --> 00:50:25,723
It bothers me a little.

489
00:50:26,792 --> 00:50:29,226
Mainly with making girls nervous.

490
00:50:33,766 --> 00:50:35,791
Making girls nervous? How?

491
00:50:36,602 --> 00:50:40,299
- If you saw me do something strenuous...
- you wouldn't want me to worry.

492
00:50:40,372 --> 00:50:42,465
- Exactly.
- That's very considerate.

493
00:50:42,541 --> 00:50:43,838
Thanks.

494
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:47,904
I just want you to enjoy yourself naturally.

495
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:50,448
You were just so sure
you could get me into bed...

496
00:50:50,516 --> 00:50:52,984
you didn't want me to be nervous
about your bad heart.

497
00:50:53,752 --> 00:50:57,381
- I don't have a bad heart.
- I'm telling you, I don't care.

498
00:50:57,856 --> 00:51:01,485
I don't know how
you even let me get into this.

499
00:51:02,528 --> 00:51:04,428
- Get you into what?
- You know what.

500
00:51:04,496 --> 00:51:07,397
- I don't have to spell it out.
- I'd like to think you helped.

501
00:51:07,466 --> 00:51:09,764
- We made love to each other.
- Repeat that.

502
00:51:09,835 --> 00:51:11,632
I'm not gonna make myself any clearer.

503
00:51:11,703 --> 00:51:15,036
Are you telling me
I'm the one responsible for all this...

504
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:18,234
when you've been asking me out forever
and I keep saying no?

505
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:20,870
- And all the time you meant yes.
- I didn't. I meant no.

506
00:51:20,946 --> 00:51:22,914
Somebody around here said yes.

507
00:51:22,981 --> 00:51:27,680
- I said yes because I felt sorry for you.
- Sure, and there's a war going on.

508
00:51:27,753 --> 00:51:30,153
- Get out of here!
- What's it look like I'm doing?

509
00:51:30,222 --> 00:51:33,157
- Do it faster, then.
- I won't even put on my shoes.

510
00:51:33,392 --> 00:51:36,054
- I never want to see you again.
- Slow down.

511
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:37,421
Never.

512
00:51:47,573 --> 00:51:50,098
- Who is it?
- Me.

513
00:51:55,514 --> 00:52:00,178
I don't know what we're talking about.
We've got to go back to work in 12 hours.

514
00:52:04,156 --> 00:52:08,490
I don't understand why it had to happen
in the first place, that's all.

515
00:52:08,894 --> 00:52:10,361
World war ii?

516
00:52:11,797 --> 00:52:12,786
No.

517
00:52:13,632 --> 00:52:16,465
Why did we have to end up
working together?

518
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:23,437
- Kay, are you all right?
- I'm fine.

519
00:52:24,476 --> 00:52:26,068
I just wondered.

520
00:52:28,447 --> 00:52:29,641
I'll never see you again...

521
00:52:29,715 --> 00:52:33,913
except monday through friday
from 4:00 till midnight, every swing shift.

522
00:52:36,121 --> 00:52:38,749
If you were any kind of gentleman...

523
00:52:39,291 --> 00:52:41,350
I'd what? Work graveyard?

524
00:52:43,128 --> 00:52:44,220
What?

525
00:52:46,899 --> 00:52:49,459
You wouldn't know so much about me.

526
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:01,301
Everywhere. In my work, in my life.

527
00:53:04,183 --> 00:53:06,378
How do I ever get rid of you?

528
00:53:09,488 --> 00:53:11,149
You can't, I hope.

529
00:53:25,237 --> 00:53:26,602
Is that bad?

530
00:53:28,974 --> 00:53:30,464
I don't know.

531
00:53:36,281 --> 00:53:38,044
I guess we're in it.

532
00:53:39,985 --> 00:53:42,579
For the duration. Oh, boy.

533
00:53:51,063 --> 00:53:54,555
You don't have to get rid of it.
You just blew your nose.

534
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:19,952
We made those.

535
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:53,048
- Sweetheart.
- Yeah?

536
00:54:53,125 --> 00:54:57,585
- Good morning. What's up?
- Allies into palermo. Axis on the run.

537
00:54:57,663 --> 00:54:59,597
- You want one?
- Sure.

538
00:55:00,165 --> 00:55:03,965
Out joy riding,
using up that black market gas?

539
00:55:04,269 --> 00:55:06,999
Yeah, spike, that's what you use
when you go joy riding.

540
00:55:07,072 --> 00:55:09,802
Lucky and Hazel invited me
to go to the beach.

541
00:55:10,142 --> 00:55:12,667
They must have thought
I was getting lonely.

542
00:55:13,378 --> 00:55:15,175
Bye, lucky. Thanks.

543
00:55:15,414 --> 00:55:18,110
- Goodbye, honey.
- Goodbye, sweetheart.

544
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:20,081
See you soon, hon.

545
00:55:20,152 --> 00:55:23,952
You ought to come next time, spike.
We had a real swell time.

546
00:55:39,971 --> 00:55:43,429
That's good. Set it at 25.

547
00:56:03,762 --> 00:56:05,730
Where do we stand now on this?

548
00:57:35,654 --> 00:57:38,088
Kay was so wonderful, wasn't she?

549
00:57:38,824 --> 00:57:40,291
Good night.

550
00:57:42,327 --> 00:57:44,318
Five guys. Yeah, like that.

551
00:57:45,263 --> 00:57:47,993
- Lucky, you seen Kay?
- Yeah.

552
00:57:48,633 --> 00:57:50,999
She got called to personnel
before the shift ended.

553
00:57:51,069 --> 00:57:54,402
- I think they're going to give her a medal.
- She saved Violet's life.

554
00:57:54,473 --> 00:57:57,704
Guess what?
They're making me a leadman.

555
00:57:57,776 --> 00:57:59,437
- Leadman?
- Yes!

556
00:58:00,312 --> 00:58:03,509
They said I was fast on my feet.
Macbride shook my hand.

557
00:58:03,582 --> 00:58:06,608
I told him the line was moving too fast,
that's what happened.

558
00:58:06,685 --> 00:58:09,552
They just smiled
and handed you a promotion, right?

559
00:58:09,955 --> 00:58:11,946
I thought you'd be proud of me.

560
00:58:13,158 --> 00:58:15,786
So we're still going to get together
later on?

561
00:58:16,161 --> 00:58:17,253
Sure.

562
00:58:22,567 --> 00:58:25,035
I am proud. Really.

563
00:58:26,238 --> 00:58:28,331
- Thanks.
- Good night, lucky.

564
00:59:13,952 --> 00:59:15,317
Here it is, girls!

565
00:59:15,387 --> 00:59:17,116
- Look!
- We're here.

566
00:59:20,859 --> 00:59:22,520
This is wonderful.

567
01:00:04,369 --> 01:00:06,564
This is better than anything.

568
01:00:07,939 --> 01:00:09,463
This place...

569
01:00:10,408 --> 01:00:11,807
the music...

570
01:00:12,644 --> 01:00:14,339
dancing with you.

571
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:17,045
It's pretty damn good.

572
01:00:21,786 --> 01:00:24,380
I wish it could be like this forever.

573
01:00:26,124 --> 01:00:27,386
Why not?

574
01:00:39,638 --> 01:00:43,039
Isn't it unusual for somebody
with your amazing looks to be a riveter?

575
01:00:43,108 --> 01:00:46,509
No, it's amazing for someone
with my unusual looks to be a riveter.

576
01:00:46,578 --> 01:00:48,273
- Touche.
- Touche?

577
01:00:48,346 --> 01:00:50,177
That means you wounded me. Slightly.

578
01:00:50,248 --> 01:00:53,445
You've got quite a line in palaver:
The come-on, the french lesson.

579
01:00:53,518 --> 01:00:56,214
You're quite a dancer.
What's your room number?

580
01:00:56,354 --> 01:00:58,447
There you go,
beating around the bush again.

581
01:00:58,523 --> 01:01:03,153
Paging smn amtzis,
Sgt. Mccloud, smn Touie.

582
01:01:03,228 --> 01:01:05,924
If I came on a little bit strong, I apologize.

583
01:01:13,138 --> 01:01:14,469
Hi, Hazel.

584
01:01:15,106 --> 01:01:17,040
- Surprised?
- Yeah.

585
01:01:17,108 --> 01:01:19,633
- All right, who's this guy?
- Pardon me.

586
01:01:19,711 --> 01:01:20,871
Pardon me, sir.

587
01:01:23,248 --> 01:01:24,772
- Isn't your...
- beat it, buddy.

588
01:01:24,849 --> 01:01:27,079
Propel your french elsewhere, sir,
and au revoir.

589
01:01:27,152 --> 01:01:28,915
That means scram, all right?

590
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,584
Good evening, Mrs. Zanussi. Seaman.

591
01:01:31,656 --> 01:01:33,385
Beat it, all right?

592
01:01:36,061 --> 01:01:38,188
Same old light touch, Hazel?

593
01:01:40,699 --> 01:01:43,031
I don't know why I did that.

594
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:47,132
Smn Touie? What...

595
01:01:47,205 --> 01:01:49,799
something in our life
keeps bringing you and me together.

596
01:01:49,874 --> 01:01:51,501
I'm shipping out tonight.

597
01:01:51,576 --> 01:01:53,771
- Tonight?
- Yeah. I'm glad, though.

598
01:01:53,845 --> 01:01:56,143
Because now I can tell you I'm sorry.

599
01:01:56,247 --> 01:01:59,080
For frankie, the broads,
the promises, everything.

600
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:03,587
- I messed up real bad with you, Hazel.
- You talk like you're going to die.

601
01:02:04,923 --> 01:02:07,187
Come on, Touie. Let's go.

602
01:02:10,595 --> 01:02:12,790
Take care of yourself, Hazel.

603
01:02:30,381 --> 01:02:33,509
- Happy new year, doll.
- It's almost midnight.

604
01:02:38,823 --> 01:02:40,688
Out of uniform, buddy?

605
01:02:41,826 --> 01:02:44,056
I don't have a uniform, buddy.

606
01:02:44,295 --> 01:02:46,593
Don't push me! Take a hike!

607
01:02:46,664 --> 01:02:47,961
Is that what you want?

608
01:02:48,032 --> 01:02:50,626
You want a piece of me, asshole?
Come and get it!

609
01:02:52,303 --> 01:02:54,134
- Wait a minute!
- No!

610
01:02:57,542 --> 01:02:59,533
Ten, nine, everybody!

611
01:02:59,644 --> 01:03:03,273
Eight, seven, six, five...

612
01:03:04,015 --> 01:03:07,473
four, three, two, one!

613
01:03:07,986 --> 01:03:09,544
Happy new year!

614
01:03:17,362 --> 01:03:20,388
June 6, 1944, d-day.

615
01:03:20,632 --> 01:03:24,534
American, british, and canadian troops
landed in northern france this morning.

616
01:03:24,602 --> 01:03:26,695
Stand by
for general eisenhower's broadcast...

617
01:03:26,771 --> 01:03:29,296
as the allies launch this great invasion.

618
01:03:29,974 --> 01:03:34,240
Soldiers, sailors, and airmen
on the allied expeditionary force...

619
01:03:35,313 --> 01:03:38,146
you're about to embark upon
the great crusade...

620
01:03:38,483 --> 01:03:41,350
toward which we've striven
these many months.

621
01:03:41,419 --> 01:03:45,822
In company with our brave allies
and brothers-in-arms on other fronts...

622
01:03:46,024 --> 01:03:49,152
you will bring about the destruction
of the german war machine.

623
01:03:49,227 --> 01:03:52,924
The elimination of nazi tyranny
over the oppressed peoples of europe...

624
01:03:52,997 --> 01:03:56,797
and security for ourselves
in the free world. Good luck.

625
01:03:57,135 --> 01:04:00,468
And let us all beseech the blessing
of almighty god...

626
01:04:00,538 --> 01:04:03,632
upon this great and noble undertaking.

627
01:04:05,743 --> 01:04:08,610
Associates, back to work!

628
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:11,514
- Happy birthday!
- Thanks.

629
01:04:11,583 --> 01:04:13,983
- The shirt's from Hazel.
- Really?

630
01:04:14,185 --> 01:04:17,586
Just give me a minute. I'll be right back.
I forgot something.

631
01:04:18,623 --> 01:04:20,921
- Thanks.
- You're welcome, lucky.

632
01:04:25,563 --> 01:04:26,894
All right.

633
01:04:27,632 --> 01:04:32,194
- What is it?
- My contribution to your musical career.

634
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:36,873
You like it?

635
01:04:37,842 --> 01:04:39,434
Jesus, Kay.

636
01:04:40,645 --> 01:04:43,136
- Baby, thanks.
- You're welcome.

637
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:16,808
It's me!

638
01:05:18,316 --> 01:05:19,806
Kay, I'm home!

639
01:05:21,152 --> 01:05:23,712
- Who wants a beer?
- I do.

640
01:06:02,961 --> 01:06:04,121
- Hi.
- Hi.

641
01:06:04,629 --> 01:06:06,221
Is my wife here?

642
01:06:06,898 --> 01:06:08,126
Is Kay here?

643
01:06:08,399 --> 01:06:10,629
Kay, look who's here.

644
01:06:11,302 --> 01:06:12,826
Watch this.

645
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:27,778
- I don't believe it.
- I'm on liberty.

646
01:06:28,252 --> 01:06:30,243
- I brought you a rose.
- Thanks.

647
01:06:32,824 --> 01:06:34,724
- This is lucky.
- Hi.

648
01:06:35,393 --> 01:06:37,827
- Lucky, nice to meet you.
- And Hazel.

649
01:06:40,465 --> 01:06:42,262
We all work together.

650
01:06:42,433 --> 01:06:44,663
- Come on, let's...
- excuse us.

651
01:06:52,276 --> 01:06:54,744
We're shipping out again in 48 hours.

652
01:06:55,513 --> 01:06:59,347
Couldn't tell anybody we were coming in.
Couldn't breathe a word about it.

653
01:06:59,417 --> 01:07:01,282
- How about that?
- That's something.

654
01:07:13,231 --> 01:07:15,392
Kay, where...

655
01:07:30,681 --> 01:07:33,343
- what is it, honey?
- Who's the leadman?

656
01:07:36,487 --> 01:07:38,045
Anybody I know?

657
01:07:39,023 --> 01:07:41,924
- Yeah, it's somebody you know.
- Who is it?

658
01:07:44,695 --> 01:07:47,596
- It's me. I'm the leadman.
- You?

659
01:07:51,536 --> 01:07:52,594
See.

660
01:07:59,477 --> 01:08:01,206
I got a promotion.

661
01:08:01,913 --> 01:08:03,778
- That's great.
- Thanks.

662
01:08:04,782 --> 01:08:08,912
I came in to try on my civvies
and see what they felt like...

663
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:12,678
- but they didn't seem to be here.
- I'm sorry, honey.

664
01:08:13,157 --> 01:08:16,024
This closet, it's full of equipment and stuff.

665
01:08:16,094 --> 01:08:19,154
It's like fibber mcgee's closet.
But they're in boxes...

666
01:08:19,230 --> 01:08:23,997
no. Don't bother with it, Kay.
I can't wear them anyway.

667
01:08:24,235 --> 01:08:26,533
I'll just wear them in the house.

668
01:08:27,972 --> 01:08:30,668
I'm sorry. My gosh.

669
01:08:32,276 --> 01:08:33,709
What a mess.

670
01:08:39,784 --> 01:08:41,376
Congratulations.

671
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:43,280
Thanks.

672
01:08:45,423 --> 01:08:47,891
- You got it.
- Yeah, I got it.

673
01:08:48,526 --> 01:08:51,051
- Got it all over everything.
- Good job.

674
01:08:51,462 --> 01:08:52,656
Thanks.

675
01:08:56,934 --> 01:08:58,925
Did you have a good rest?

676
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:01,500
Sure did.

677
01:09:06,544 --> 01:09:08,705
- Welcome home, honey.
- Thanks.

678
01:09:21,626 --> 01:09:23,753
So are you going to change that?

679
01:09:24,328 --> 01:09:25,659
Sure, honey.

680
01:09:33,471 --> 01:09:37,168
So, like I said, congratulations. Congrats.

681
01:09:38,242 --> 01:09:39,903
- For what?
- You know.

682
01:09:41,879 --> 01:09:45,246
- What did you say you were making?
- $1.35 an hour.

683
01:09:46,384 --> 01:09:49,182
- What did you say about overtime?
- I didn't.

684
01:09:50,454 --> 01:09:52,081
Beats me, anyway.

685
01:09:54,192 --> 01:09:57,059
Beats me all to hell. Here's to you, kiddo.

686
01:09:59,130 --> 01:10:01,064
And that guy you work with...

687
01:10:01,966 --> 01:10:03,490
what's his name?

688
01:10:03,834 --> 01:10:04,994
Lucky.

689
01:10:07,104 --> 01:10:10,267
- There's no question about that.
- What do you mean?

690
01:10:10,675 --> 01:10:13,872
He's stateside. He's not in uniform.
How lucky can he get?

691
01:10:14,278 --> 01:10:16,678
I don't think he'd call it lucky.

692
01:10:17,715 --> 01:10:20,582
The next time you go to work,
ask him what he'd call it...

693
01:10:20,651 --> 01:10:23,142
and where I might stand in line to get it.

694
01:10:23,721 --> 01:10:25,916
What would you call it, Jack?

695
01:10:28,192 --> 01:10:30,217
I'd call it cheating, Kay.

696
01:10:34,732 --> 01:10:36,359
I went to war!

697
01:10:38,035 --> 01:10:41,766
- I know.
- So who else got lucky besides lucky?

698
01:10:46,077 --> 01:10:48,045
Didn't it mean anything?

699
01:10:52,650 --> 01:10:54,379
That you're my wife?

700
01:10:56,220 --> 01:10:58,415
Of course it meant something.

701
01:11:03,394 --> 01:11:07,524
I tried to wait but everything in this house
reminded me of you...

702
01:11:07,598 --> 01:11:08,997
sure, baby.

703
01:11:11,135 --> 01:11:13,899
Blame it on the war.
It's everybody's excuse.

704
01:11:14,305 --> 01:11:15,966
I'm not the same.

705
01:11:17,842 --> 01:11:19,605
And neither are you.

706
01:11:21,245 --> 01:11:22,576
I'm sorry.

707
01:11:26,651 --> 01:11:28,551
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

708
01:11:31,822 --> 01:11:33,619
Do you love this guy?

709
01:11:52,243 --> 01:11:54,211
Jack, please forgive me.

710
01:12:04,255 --> 01:12:07,053
- Moon told me about that.
- See you tomorrow.

711
01:12:08,926 --> 01:12:11,292
What the hell are you doing here?

712
01:12:11,395 --> 01:12:14,455
- Thought you were sick.
- Talk to you a minute, Hazel?

713
01:12:14,532 --> 01:12:15,624
Sure.

714
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,932
Come on, Violet, let's go pick up Peggy.

715
01:12:22,106 --> 01:12:23,164
Good night, Hazel.

716
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:26,539
Listen, I'm playing at kelly's
later on tonight.

717
01:12:26,777 --> 01:12:28,244
Want to come?

718
01:12:31,282 --> 01:12:32,909
I don't think so.

719
01:12:35,586 --> 01:12:36,917
All right.

720
01:12:39,724 --> 01:12:42,454
- Suit yourself.
- You going to be all right?

721
01:12:47,131 --> 01:12:48,598
Never better.

722
01:13:16,961 --> 01:13:18,553
Is this seat taken?

723
01:13:24,368 --> 01:13:25,801
One scotch.

724
01:14:11,482 --> 01:14:14,042
- You're leaving so early...
- I couldn't sleep.

725
01:14:14,685 --> 01:14:16,676
I got to get out of here.

726
01:14:17,054 --> 01:14:19,045
- Did you read my note?
- No.

727
01:14:19,290 --> 01:14:21,315
What does the note say, Jack?

728
01:14:23,027 --> 01:14:24,517
What's it say?

729
01:14:25,029 --> 01:14:28,021
I can't believe what you've done.

730
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,527
Honey, I'm sorry.

731
01:14:35,973 --> 01:14:38,498
All right. Let's get out of here.

732
01:14:56,393 --> 01:14:57,792
"Dear Kay...

733
01:14:58,195 --> 01:15:01,722
"I don't understand what you've done,
but I guess you're right.

734
01:15:02,199 --> 01:15:03,928
"Everything changes.

735
01:15:04,235 --> 01:15:08,137
"I'm different, you're different,
the whole world is different.

736
01:15:09,607 --> 01:15:11,666
"I don't know what's right anymore.

737
01:15:11,742 --> 01:15:14,575
"I guess we both
have a lot of thinking to do.

738
01:15:15,179 --> 01:15:17,909
"I'll try and write
when I'm not so confused.

739
01:15:18,549 --> 01:15:20,744
"They say the war will be over soon.

740
01:15:20,818 --> 01:15:24,948
"I hope so.
It's sure taken its toll on all of us.

741
01:15:25,923 --> 01:15:28,255
"All the best. Jack."

742
01:16:00,190 --> 01:16:03,421
What did you think of the guys
I played with last night?

743
01:16:04,061 --> 01:16:06,825
They were okay. You were better.

744
01:16:09,633 --> 01:16:12,329
They're heading back east
in a couple of weeks.

745
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:15,530
I could probably work it out
to go with them.

746
01:16:27,484 --> 01:16:29,475
What's the matter, Hazel?

747
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:32,553
It's not gonna be so hot
telling Kay about this.

748
01:16:33,357 --> 01:16:35,484
What's the big hurry in telling her?

749
01:16:35,559 --> 01:16:38,926
Besides, I'm the one
with the broken heart, remember?

750
01:16:40,230 --> 01:16:43,165
I don't think I can look her in the eye
until I do.

751
01:17:09,793 --> 01:17:11,283
Wait a minute!

752
01:17:45,629 --> 01:17:46,857
Come in.

753
01:18:00,511 --> 01:18:03,139
God. I don't even recognize the place.

754
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:06,315
- Would you like some tea?
- Some tea?

755
01:18:15,793 --> 01:18:17,556
I'll take some tea.

756
01:18:25,235 --> 01:18:28,363
Jack's mother gave me this tea set
when we were married.

757
01:18:29,173 --> 01:18:31,437
Really? It's lovely.

758
01:18:32,776 --> 01:18:34,107
Thank you.

759
01:18:36,914 --> 01:18:38,074
Cream?

760
01:18:39,483 --> 01:18:40,882
Yes, please.

761
01:18:42,352 --> 01:18:43,512
Sugar?

762
01:18:44,888 --> 01:18:46,378
You got sugar?

763
01:18:47,925 --> 01:18:49,517
How many sugars?

764
01:18:50,561 --> 01:18:52,188
No sugar. Thanks.

765
01:18:58,969 --> 01:19:01,062
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

766
01:19:05,542 --> 01:19:06,804
Sandwich?

767
01:19:08,579 --> 01:19:11,742
Kay, seeing you with Jack
made lucky nuts.

768
01:19:11,815 --> 01:19:14,613
I was lonely. It's not gonna happen again.

769
01:19:20,257 --> 01:19:23,317
Who would have thought
this would happen to us?

770
01:19:29,466 --> 01:19:31,593
What are we gonna do about this?

771
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,837
We'll all be friends.

772
01:19:43,814 --> 01:19:45,145
What else?

773
01:20:56,119 --> 01:20:57,711
All right!

774
01:20:59,957 --> 01:21:01,049
Thank you.

775
01:21:01,124 --> 01:21:02,819
- Waiter.
- Hold on.

776
01:21:03,861 --> 01:21:06,591
Honey, don't you think
you'd better take it easy?

777
01:21:06,663 --> 01:21:09,826
- Why? We're celebrating, aren't we?
- What are we celebrating?

778
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:12,596
Everything. Friendship.

779
01:21:20,844 --> 01:21:22,368
So, here we are.

780
01:21:23,947 --> 01:21:27,678
- You still blow a mean horn, lucky.
- Glad you liked it, Kay.

781
01:21:28,318 --> 01:21:30,912
Hazel liked it, too. Didn't you, haz?

782
01:21:33,423 --> 01:21:35,687
- Fresh circle.
- Fresh circle?

783
01:21:35,759 --> 01:21:37,249
Another round.

784
01:21:43,133 --> 01:21:45,033
To lucky and Hazel.

785
01:21:45,802 --> 01:21:47,269
Kay and Jack.

786
01:21:48,472 --> 01:21:50,372
Here's mud in your eye.

787
01:21:53,310 --> 01:21:56,871
- Kay, why don't you slow down?
- Don't tell me what to do.

788
01:22:00,717 --> 01:22:03,117
Isn't it funny how things happen so fast?

789
01:22:03,186 --> 01:22:05,984
You've had too much to drink,
so why don't you slow down?

790
01:22:06,056 --> 01:22:07,045
Isn't it?

791
01:22:07,391 --> 01:22:09,188
Yeah, it's funny.

792
01:22:09,559 --> 01:22:12,551
All the time
that lucky and I were together...

793
01:22:13,597 --> 01:22:17,192
and all the time that Hazel and I
were best friends, I never knew.

794
01:22:17,267 --> 01:22:20,828
It wasn't like that. I told you,
it happened all of a sudden.

795
01:22:21,071 --> 01:22:24,131
Come on. I thought you said
we were gonna be friends.

796
01:22:25,242 --> 01:22:28,143
Friends are the most
important thing, right?

797
01:22:28,211 --> 01:22:30,941
- Here's to good music.
- Right, Hazel?

798
01:22:33,116 --> 01:22:34,583
Lots of things are important.

799
01:22:34,651 --> 01:22:36,710
But friends are the most important thing.

800
01:22:36,787 --> 01:22:39,415
Good friends. Friends you can trust.

801
01:22:39,489 --> 01:22:43,152
You mean like husbands are supposed
to be able to trust their wives?

802
01:22:43,226 --> 01:22:44,955
- Tone it, Hazel.
- Will you shut up!

803
01:22:45,028 --> 01:22:48,930
The way your love life was going, I don't
blame you for taking what you could get.

804
01:22:48,999 --> 01:22:50,023
Thanks, Kay.

805
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:53,160
What about you, Jack, and lucky?
That made a real pretty picture.

806
01:22:53,236 --> 01:22:56,728
That was me and Jack and lucky!
This is me and you and lucky!

807
01:22:56,807 --> 01:22:58,832
All right, that's it. You two don't need me.

808
01:22:58,909 --> 01:23:02,003
Nope, I'm going.
You're on your own, sweetheart.

809
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:08,450
- There's a word for you.
- Stay away from me!

810
01:23:08,518 --> 01:23:10,179
Only I can't say it.

811
01:23:11,021 --> 01:23:13,216
Yes, I can. Whore!

812
01:23:13,290 --> 01:23:16,453
- Did you call me a whore?
- See anybody else I could be speaking to?

813
01:23:16,526 --> 01:23:19,324
- You're the whore, sweetheart.
- You're a bigger whore!

814
01:23:19,396 --> 01:23:22,559
I've slept with someone's boyfriend,
but I didn't spend two years...

815
01:23:22,632 --> 01:23:25,362
putting a knife in my husband's back.
You're the whore.

816
01:23:25,435 --> 01:23:26,459
What do you know?

817
01:23:26,536 --> 01:23:30,165
You never had a husband or boyfriend!
You never had anything!

818
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:32,604
There's nothing wrong with me, Kay.

819
01:23:32,676 --> 01:23:37,204
I don't care what happens to you or him.
So why don't you just go away, okay?

820
01:23:37,514 --> 01:23:38,606
Ride?

821
01:23:40,017 --> 01:23:42,611
- Where to, sweetie?
- Wait a minute.

822
01:23:42,686 --> 01:23:45,746
Get your hands off me! Get away from me!

823
01:23:46,423 --> 01:23:47,913
Let's just go.

824
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:52,827
- I was in love!
- Shut up!

825
01:23:58,635 --> 01:24:01,399
- Come on, Kay. I'll get you home.
- Don't touch me!

826
01:24:01,471 --> 01:24:03,336
How're you gonna get home?

827
01:24:04,007 --> 01:24:08,068
If I can build a goddamn airplane
I can get myself home.

828
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:38,232
How do you feel?

829
01:24:38,809 --> 01:24:40,208
I feel sick.

830
01:24:47,217 --> 01:24:50,050
I called Macbride's this morning and quit.

831
01:24:53,723 --> 01:24:55,122
I'm leaving.

832
01:25:10,173 --> 01:25:11,902
You want this back?

833
01:25:13,043 --> 01:25:15,637
No. I'd really like you to keep that.

834
01:25:17,147 --> 01:25:19,775
Me, too. Thanks.

835
01:25:24,121 --> 01:25:25,782
Come with me, Kay.

836
01:25:29,259 --> 01:25:30,487
I can't.

837
01:25:55,252 --> 01:25:56,549
Bye, Kay.

838
01:26:03,426 --> 01:26:07,453
Mabel Stoddard's husband is in the pacific.
She took this job for the duration.

839
01:26:07,531 --> 01:26:10,625
Mrs. Stoddard, how do you like your job?

840
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:11,724
I love it.

841
01:26:11,801 --> 01:26:14,429
How about after the war?
Do you plan to keep on working?

842
01:26:14,504 --> 01:26:18,235
As I said, when my husband comes back,
I'm gonna be busy at home.

843
01:26:18,308 --> 01:26:19,798
Good for you.

844
01:26:21,545 --> 01:26:25,481
Each returning serviceman
will get his job back when the war is won.

845
01:26:25,749 --> 01:26:30,709
You girls and women, you'll go home,
back to being housewives and mothers...

846
01:26:30,787 --> 01:26:33,483
as you promised to do
when you came to work with us.

847
01:26:33,557 --> 01:26:36,117
Your lives will return to normal.

848
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:38,791
Thank you.

849
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:45,431
Thank you.

850
01:26:55,345 --> 01:26:57,006
Attention, please.

851
01:26:57,247 --> 01:27:00,705
The ceremony commemorating
the last sbd dive bomber...

852
01:27:00,784 --> 01:27:04,083
produced by Macbride's
will start in a few moments.

853
01:27:12,963 --> 01:27:17,559
Associates, we share
a great moment in history.

854
01:27:18,034 --> 01:27:21,094
Japan has surrendered. The war is over!

855
01:27:32,315 --> 01:27:33,612
Associates...

856
01:27:33,683 --> 01:27:36,948
excuse me! Can we have
some quiet, please, for Mr. Macbride?

857
01:27:38,488 --> 01:27:42,720
Associates, I want to thank each
and every one of you...

858
01:27:42,792 --> 01:27:44,817
for a job well done!

859
01:28:01,611 --> 01:28:04,603
They dropped us, just like that. I knew it.

860
01:28:05,615 --> 01:28:09,813
...knowing you have done your part
to bring peace to a strife-torn world.

861
01:28:09,886 --> 01:28:12,013
Especially you girls
who've given so much...

862
01:28:12,088 --> 01:28:13,578
good luck to you.

863
01:28:13,657 --> 01:28:16,455
...now you can become
housewives and mothers again...

864
01:28:16,526 --> 01:28:19,962
to make homes and families
for all our returning heroes.

865
01:28:20,463 --> 01:28:22,658
"Last hired, first fired."

866
01:28:22,999 --> 01:28:25,900
They're taking away
the best job I ever had.

867
01:28:26,736 --> 01:28:28,727
A year of welding school.

868
01:28:39,516 --> 01:28:40,676
Shirt?

869
01:29:12,148 --> 01:29:14,639
"Dear lucky,
I was cleaning house yesterday...

870
01:29:14,718 --> 01:29:18,347
"when I came across these pictures
of our going-away party at Macbride's.

871
01:29:18,421 --> 01:29:19,945
"I thought you might like them.

872
01:29:20,023 --> 01:29:22,992
"I haven't heard from Jack in a while,
but I've been notified...

873
01:29:23,059 --> 01:29:27,962
"of his fleet's arrival next week.
I'm hoping for the best.

874
01:29:28,732 --> 01:29:30,632
"I know things got muddled in the end...

875
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:33,430
"but I just want to say thanks
for so many things.

876
01:29:33,503 --> 01:29:37,667
"I sure hope things are finally
going your way. Good luck, Kay."

877
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:15,971
Please forgive me.

878
01:30:22,018 --> 01:30:23,610
You're forgiven.

879
01:30:55,718 --> 01:30:59,279
- How did you get here?
- I borrowed spike and Ethel's car.

880
01:31:02,892 --> 01:31:04,792
Come on. Let's go home.

881
01:31:07,330 --> 01:31:10,697
- Can I help you with this, or anything?
- No, I got it.

882
01:31:40,430 --> 01:31:42,091
Put your bag down.

883
01:31:50,039 --> 01:31:53,600
I went to the store
and got something special for dinner.

884
01:31:54,711 --> 01:31:56,804
Unless you'd rather go out.

885
01:32:01,684 --> 01:32:03,083
Where is he?

886
01:32:04,153 --> 01:32:05,484
It's over.

887
01:32:08,057 --> 01:32:09,684
That's good news.

888
01:32:11,661 --> 01:32:13,652
I know I hurt you, honey.

889
01:32:18,434 --> 01:32:19,799
I love you.

890
01:33:08,051 --> 01:33:09,541
Still working?

891
01:33:10,954 --> 01:33:13,286
They let us go when it was all over.

892
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:16,489
That makes two of us.

893
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:18,689
We're both out of a job.

894
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:33,172
I just love you so goddamn much.

895
01:33:34,911 --> 01:33:36,538
I love you, too.

896
01:33:46,756 --> 01:33:49,452
- Jeannie, what's this?
- It's called dip.

897
01:33:49,525 --> 01:33:52,426
- Yeah?
- You stick a potato chip in it.

898
01:33:53,830 --> 01:33:55,957
- Hi, how are you?
- How are you?

899
01:33:58,201 --> 01:34:01,864
Everybody, I'd like to introduce
to all of you...

900
01:34:01,938 --> 01:34:04,202
this is my new husband,
archibald Touie.

901
01:34:04,273 --> 01:34:05,763
How do you do?

902
01:34:09,479 --> 01:34:10,776
A washer?

903
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:12,747
All electric.

904
01:34:15,084 --> 01:34:17,177
It tore a shirt the other day.

905
01:34:17,987 --> 01:34:19,852
- Hi, everybody.
- Kay!

906
01:34:21,391 --> 01:34:24,258
This is Jack, my husband.
He just got back.

907
01:34:26,562 --> 01:34:29,395
I'm Clarence. Welcome home, boy.

908
01:34:30,266 --> 01:34:31,699
- This is Annie.
- Hi, Annie.

909
01:34:31,768 --> 01:34:35,260
The government's promised us
a new ranch house in the valley.

910
01:34:35,438 --> 01:34:38,532
- They're building a whole bunch of them.
- Ranch house, terrific.

911
01:34:38,608 --> 01:34:39,870
They're all alike, too.

912
01:34:39,942 --> 01:34:44,276
With these servicemen coming back,
there's gonna be a large need for housing.

913
01:34:47,216 --> 01:34:49,514
Hi, I just wanted to say...

914
01:34:50,853 --> 01:34:52,445
congratulations.

915
01:34:52,722 --> 01:34:56,556
Thank you. This is my husband,
archibald Touie.

916
01:34:56,626 --> 01:34:58,890
- Biscuits Touie.
- Nice to meet you.

917
01:34:58,961 --> 01:35:00,360
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

918
01:35:00,430 --> 01:35:02,955
- So you were in the pacific?
- You bet. Yup.

919
01:35:03,232 --> 01:35:04,961
You hear about these new ranch houses?

920
01:35:05,034 --> 01:35:08,902
I just want to forget about the past
and start all over again.

921
01:35:09,806 --> 01:35:13,503
With another little one on the way,
I'm sure glad Deacon has a job.

922
01:35:13,576 --> 01:35:16,704
Remember that first day
when we were all standing in line?

923
01:35:16,779 --> 01:35:18,110
I was so scared.

924
01:35:18,181 --> 01:35:21,617
- I thought they were gonna laugh at us.
- They did laugh at us.

925
01:35:22,952 --> 01:35:25,443
- Well, we showed them.
- We sure did.

926
01:35:28,658 --> 01:35:30,182
We showed them.

927
01:35:34,497 --> 01:35:37,398
Here's to Kay and Jack,
Jeannie and Bobby...

928
01:35:37,467 --> 01:35:40,368
Clarence and Annie, Violet and Deacon...

929
01:35:42,138 --> 01:35:44,470
and Hazel and me.

930
01:35:44,841 --> 01:35:46,172
And all of us.

931
01:35:46,242 --> 01:35:49,405
And no more war. One hell of a future!

932
01:35:49,746 --> 01:35:51,077
All right!

933
01:37:31,447 --> 01:37:33,779
We showed them, didn't we?

934
01:37:35,451 --> 01:37:37,942
Boy, did we ever.
