1
00:00:38,072 --> 00:00:41,111
Come on, lay off with that scratch!

2
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:43,728
Ain't bothering you.

3
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,929
Yes it is,
that ain't no kind of music.

4
00:00:47,163 --> 00:00:49,284
At least I make a sound.

5
00:00:49,435 --> 00:00:52,122
Yeah, and it's a nasty one.

6
00:01:03,807 --> 00:01:06,806
Wanna try again tonight?
Might as well.

7
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:07,150
MUSIC PLAYS FROM CLUB

8
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:12,027
# I know a gal
by the name of Maid Lou

9
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:17,637
# She shook it so much
she had the German flu

10
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,890
# No matter how she done it

11
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,528
# Oh, no matter how she done it

12
00:04:28,526 --> 00:04:32,725
# Well, no matter how she done it

13
00:04:33,014 --> 00:04:36,972
# She done it just the same

14
00:04:41,662 --> 00:04:43,681
# The women didn't like her

15
00:04:43,824 --> 00:04:47,062
# And they called her out
of her name

16
00:04:47,293 --> 00:04:50,002
# But the men, they loved her

17
00:04:50,155 --> 00:04:52,631
# Mmm, it was a crying shame

18
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:55,217
# No matter how she done it

19
00:04:57,908 --> 00:05:00,107
# No matter how she done it

20
00:05:03,716 --> 00:05:08,034
# Well, no matter how she done it

21
00:05:08,398 --> 00:05:12,657
# She done it just the same

22
00:05:14,827 --> 00:05:18,544
# No matter how she done it

23
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:22,525
# She done it just the same

24
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:26,698
# Yes, she did. #

25
00:05:32,508 --> 00:05:34,552
You take it for a while.

26
00:05:34,676 --> 00:05:38,114
They making all that racket again
at Toussaint's.

27
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,301
Yeah, all them people
over there buying drinks,

28
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:44,434
throwin' that money after them
dice and what not.

29
00:05:45,981 --> 00:05:47,580
Lucky we got none of that here.

30
00:05:49,234 --> 00:05:51,753
# You can drink your liquor

31
00:05:52,383 --> 00:05:56,041
# You can drink your cold can beer

32
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,559
# You can drink your good whisky

33
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:06,148
# You can drink your cool can beer

34
00:06:08,775 --> 00:06:11,854
# You can stay out
all with your sweet gal

35
00:06:12,092 --> 00:06:16,210
# But, Papa,
don't you leave me here

36
00:06:18,855 --> 00:06:22,034
# I hear that wild ox moaning

37
00:06:22,195 --> 00:06:25,054
# Looking for that Texas... #

38
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,189
Sounding good, huh?

39
00:06:26,235 --> 00:06:29,013
Sounds fine. Always has.

40
00:06:32,257 --> 00:06:35,736
Not much of a crowd. Not a crowd at all,

41
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:40,866
just some stiffs who wanna drink themselves
to sleep without the music waking them up.

42
00:06:41,705 --> 00:06:43,549
You oughta advertise.

43
00:06:43,665 --> 00:06:45,750
Got an attraction like Bertha Mae.

44
00:06:45,877 --> 00:06:49,275
Singing is one thing, Slick, but
whether people wanna look at you

45
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:52,187
when you do it is another.
Got quite a number

46
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:55,065
over the Toussaint's place tonight.
Sounds like it.

47
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,423
Lots of young folks coming in
to listen to that box of his.

48
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:03,397
I don't see why we don't just turn our
box on, let folks feed it nickels like they do.

49
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:06,612
The lady is singing.

50
00:07:06,756 --> 00:07:11,793
# You hear me pleading, baby
Baby, don't you leave me here... #

51
00:07:12,047 --> 00:07:15,491
But didn't nobody come
to listen to her, Slick.

52
00:07:16,725 --> 00:07:18,889
# Come here, sweet Daddy

53
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:22,702
# Let me whisper in your ear... #

54
00:07:22,897 --> 00:07:26,376
Like the man say,
you can't argue with failure.

55
00:07:26,563 --> 00:07:29,724
You know why Slick
here's like a preacher?

56
00:07:29,897 --> 00:07:33,023
Cos he do all his best work
on his knees!

57
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,949
Never mind him, he's just drunk.

58
00:07:36,078 --> 00:07:40,396
I heard she put a ring through it,
use it to drag him round the house.

59
00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:44,173
Come on, you know Tyrone
don't like no scuffle in here.

60
00:07:44,308 --> 00:07:47,786
I ought to get me old lady,
help out with the groceries...

61
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,849
You just gotta sweet talk her some,
give her a little poke every now and then.

62
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:57,505
You gonna drink,
or you gonna lay Gentlemen!

63
00:07:57,284 --> 00:07:58,888
Miss Delilah.

64
00:07:58,994 --> 00:08:01,313
Let's behave ourselves.

65
00:08:02,835 --> 00:08:04,294
What are you boys doing in here?

66
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:08,133
Out, out! And what are you
doing behind that bar?

67
00:08:09,744 --> 00:08:12,203
It's just for a minute.
That's 60 seconds too long.

68
00:08:12,321 --> 00:08:13,740
Maceo, take that child's place.

69
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,586
You bring people their food,
Nobody's eating!

70
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,917
That's cos nobody's here
but these couple of lost souls.

71
00:08:23,077 --> 00:08:27,375
Haven't had an appetite since
they gave over to the devil.

72
00:08:33,256 --> 00:08:37,654
Evening, Maceo,
you looking good tonight!

73
00:08:37,957 --> 00:08:40,336
Likewise, Miss Nadine.

74
00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:42,032
What can I do for you?

75
00:08:42,332 --> 00:08:45,091
Oh, you know what you can do for me,
sweet man.

76
00:08:47,464 --> 00:08:49,903
What would you like... to drink?

77
00:08:56,444 --> 00:08:58,203
How many is that tonight?

78
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,445
Don't talk to me about that, baby.

79
00:09:00,556 --> 00:09:03,634
Not tonight. I don't want
China Doll behind that bar.

80
00:09:03,804 --> 00:09:05,294
She's got to help out.

81
00:09:05,395 --> 00:09:08,873
Not behind there she doesn't. You
know she's not supposed to get excited.

82
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,069
Not much chance of that in here.

83
00:09:11,192 --> 00:09:15,431
Harvest hands all crowded in
to Toussaint's place.

84
00:09:15,651 --> 00:09:17,380
Young ones.

85
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:19,495
You'll get some of them.

86
00:09:19,618 --> 00:09:24,176
They'll stick their noses in here, get
one little sniff of the music and go home.

87
00:09:26,021 --> 00:09:28,165
Maybe that's the wages of sin.

88
00:09:28,275 --> 00:09:30,674
Ain't no sin happening
here tonight, baby.

89
00:09:30,814 --> 00:09:33,143
And there sure as hell
ain't no wages.

90
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,437
Your God wants to chastise some sinners,
he'd best go over to Toussaint's.

91
00:09:37,653 --> 00:09:40,017
Got a whole bar room
crowded with them.

92
00:09:40,156 --> 00:09:41,765
He's not my God.

93
00:09:42,184 --> 00:09:44,404
He's everybody's God.

94
00:09:48,718 --> 00:09:50,757
How did the meeting go tonight?

95
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:54,394
Viola Underwood found the Lord.

96
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:58,518
If she'd found Him last,
she wouldn't have come through.

97
00:09:58,745 --> 00:10:04,863
She must have lost Him again between then and now cos
she come down that aisle tonight hollering in tongues.

98
00:10:08,164 --> 00:10:10,082
The spirit didn't move you, though?

99
00:10:11,692 --> 00:10:12,891
Not yet.

100
00:10:16,395 --> 00:10:19,014
Maybe it's too late for me.

101
00:10:23,587 --> 00:10:26,685
I can't believe he's serving
Alton Stokely. That poor man.

102
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:29,424
Toussaint cut his credit off.

103
00:10:29,555 --> 00:10:35,053
Either he gets it here, or he drinks that paint
peeler Willie Pettigrew cuts up back in his swamp.

104
00:10:35,327 --> 00:10:37,891
I'm gonna go home,
say a prayer for that man.

105
00:10:40,546 --> 00:10:42,145
Say one for me too, baby.

106
00:10:54,184 --> 00:10:56,668
Outstanding, baby. 

107
00:10:56,812 --> 00:10:59,111
Outstanding. You've still got the voice.

108
00:10:59,247 --> 00:11:02,511
You think so? - Chills down my spine
just to hear you.

109
00:11:05,313 --> 00:11:08,251
Ty, I'm gonna be
a little late Saturday.

110
00:11:08,983 --> 00:11:12,187
No need to come in
if you don't want to.

111
00:11:14,169 --> 00:11:16,568
I've made other arrangements.

112
00:11:16,805 --> 00:11:19,654
Other arrangements?

113
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:22,028
Try something new in here.
You can't do that. Yes, he can, darling.

114
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:27,253
This is his place,
and he can do whatever he wants.

115
00:11:27,506 --> 00:11:29,350
You'll know where to find me when you need me. 

116
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,859
Put the box on now, Ty?

117
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,349
Yeah, put the box on.

118
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:48,366
I'm gonna crank it up some,
see if we can draw some life in here.

119
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,779
LOUD JAZZ MUSIC

120
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,019
There it goes again.

121
00:12:04,132 --> 00:12:07,691
Electricity don't like that jukebox.

122
00:12:14,476 --> 00:12:16,800
Must be a short circuit
in the juke here.

123
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:20,735
Got to get the power company No,
they turned my juice off last month.

124
00:12:20,936 --> 00:12:24,580
I don't want you sniffing
around that splice out Maceo did.

125
00:12:24,774 --> 00:12:27,215
It's nice in here.

126
00:12:27,357 --> 00:12:29,729
Kind of romantic.

127
00:12:29,868 --> 00:12:33,306
I'm gonna have to go out back,
wiggle some things around.

128
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:36,894
Don't you wiggle nothing round
unless I'm there to see it.

129
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:40,082
You don't worry, folks,
bar's still open.

130
00:12:47,595 --> 00:12:49,674
Evening, folks.

131
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,169
Evening, Sherriff.

132
00:12:57,329 --> 00:13:00,153
Your light's gone out.

133
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:02,200
Looks like it.

134
00:13:02,319 --> 00:13:05,398
You'll know that'll be a violation
of something or other.

135
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:07,651
We're just about to close up here.

136
00:13:09,326 --> 00:13:11,684
Oh. Ooh, your wife been cooking?

137
00:13:11,822 --> 00:13:13,791
Not tonight.

138
00:13:13,913 --> 00:13:15,677
Went to a revival chat.

139
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:19,114
Ah, I stood by there myself.

140
00:13:19,294 --> 00:13:22,817
Them niggers were singing up a storm.

141
00:13:23,006 --> 00:13:25,885
I just came out here
to look in on Toussaint.

142
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:29,770
Had that shooting two nights ago.

143
00:13:29,967 --> 00:13:31,971
Lots of fighting in there.

144
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:34,623
There is that.

145
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:38,087
Course, me and old Toussaint,

146
00:13:38,267 --> 00:13:40,751
we got us an agreement.

147
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:47,514
Them field hands
start sucking down that whisky,

148
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,937
hopping them all up with music,
there's gonna be some razors drawn.

149
00:13:54,122 --> 00:13:56,606
Course, he only call me
if it's a fatality.

150
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:01,508
Never been a killing here. Them
youngbloods know better than to mess...

151
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,839
Than to mess with Tyrone Purvis.

152
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:08,507
You've got quite a reputation
round here, Tyrone.

153
00:14:08,694 --> 00:14:12,158
People say you put some poor
black boy in the grave.

154
00:14:18,523 --> 00:14:20,602
Just people talking.

155
00:14:20,728 --> 00:14:23,217
Uh-huh.

156
00:14:23,361 --> 00:14:24,924
You just remember,

157
00:14:25,028 --> 00:14:27,113
this is my county, Tyrone.

158
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,283
What goes on goes on cos I let it.

159
00:14:30,451 --> 00:14:33,810
Don't want nobody getting too big
for their breeches round here.

160
00:14:38,668 --> 00:14:40,867
You folks have a pleasant evening.

161
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,988
Nigger ain't shit in this world.

162
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,925
Speaking for yourself.

163
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:04,142
You ain't had his club, Tyrone,
what do you think you'd be?

164
00:15:04,398 --> 00:15:06,962
You wouldn't be nothing.

165
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:11,976
If that ain't truth,
then grits ain't grocery.

166
00:15:28,012 --> 00:15:31,256
TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS

167
00:15:31,432 --> 00:15:34,675
That's a terrible noise.

168
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:38,490
Just the northbound Talladega.
Sounds like it always does.

169
00:15:38,684 --> 00:15:42,567
Like a soul being carried away
from this life.

170
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:49,302
Come on in, darling,

171
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:51,408
before you catch
your death out here.

172
00:16:24,987 --> 00:16:29,505
You're lucky the high sheriff ain't
seen you crawling out that boxcar.

173
00:16:29,737 --> 00:16:32,981
Does he come around here much?Only when he bored.

174
00:16:34,706 --> 00:16:37,305
You working on a train?Yeah, Kansas City to New Orleans.

175
00:16:37,453 --> 00:16:40,034
What did you get off here for?

176
00:16:40,183 --> 00:16:42,596
I got people here. How about you?

177
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:45,114
Got tired of sleeping in a boxcar.

178
00:16:47,094 --> 00:16:49,693
Is there a place to stay
around here?

179
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,291
Shed right over there got a cot.

180
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:54,868
And don't mind the rats.
Not unless you've got food on you.

181
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:58,464
I see you and a good meal have
been strangers for some time.

182
00:16:58,647 --> 00:17:03,564
Get into town tomorrow, find you need
something, tell them Shack Thomas sent you.

183
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:08,458
They'll know who you're
talking about. Thanks.

184
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:16,357
Name like that sounds like
a good place for a musician.

185
00:17:18,085 --> 00:17:22,083
Only night I ever been in jail
was a town called Liberty.

186
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,616
The sun come up,
you'll see where you landed.

187
00:17:30,806 --> 00:17:33,404
You'd best be out that shed
by first light.

188
00:17:51,744 --> 00:17:56,102
Just a weekday night.
The chicken man or the ice man

189
00:17:56,327 --> 00:17:58,651
At least you don't owe
the electric company.

190
00:17:58,788 --> 00:18:00,513
Yeah, that's a big relief.

191
00:18:07,093 --> 00:18:08,852
You thinking about closing down?

192
00:18:18,147 --> 00:18:21,030
What do you think?The biggest act in New Orleans.

193
00:18:21,191 --> 00:18:24,390
Got him a hit on the radio.
He's playing here Saturday night.

194
00:18:24,565 --> 00:18:27,729
I'm thinking I wait till Bertha Mae
was gone and I put him up.

195
00:18:27,902 --> 00:18:29,511
Here?

196
00:18:29,617 --> 00:18:31,821
You mean like in this room here?

197
00:18:31,953 --> 00:18:33,757
You know the Tomcat Club
in Texicana?

198
00:18:33,872 --> 00:18:37,071
Big Jim Jameson's place?
It just went out of business.

199
00:18:37,245 --> 00:18:44,771
Damn. Since Sam is getting sway over

200
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:49,131
But you ain't never had no guitar...
I'm having one now.

201
00:18:52,474 --> 00:18:56,117
You just worry about getting these
hung everywhere in the county tomorrow.

202
00:18:56,311 --> 00:19:01,789
Payday Saturday, he's gonna draw all them
cotton pickers and soldier boys in here.

203
00:19:02,063 --> 00:19:04,024
Get us back in the black.

204
00:19:04,145 --> 00:19:06,248
They're gonna take me down,

205
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,468
it won't be without a fight.

206
00:19:08,595 --> 00:19:10,654
Guitar Sam at the Honeydripper!

207
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,430
Mm-hm!

208
00:19:12,537 --> 00:19:15,535
Man, this joint is gonna jump!

209
00:20:08,428 --> 00:20:09,787
BELL TINKLES

210
00:20:53,934 --> 00:20:56,573
GUITAR STRUMMING

211
00:21:02,902 --> 00:21:05,261
Somebody slipped
in the railroad yard.

212
00:21:12,953 --> 00:21:15,197
You all can play that thing.

213
00:21:15,331 --> 00:21:18,490
Yeah, been doing it nearby for ever.

214
00:21:20,336 --> 00:21:22,055
What side of the tracks am I on?

215
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:23,931
The wrong side.

216
00:21:24,044 --> 00:21:25,973
For you.

217
00:21:26,093 --> 00:21:29,136
What you doing here, then?

218
00:21:29,304 --> 00:21:32,108
Oh, white folks
look right through me.

219
00:21:32,265 --> 00:21:37,343
Besides, how much mischief is an old,
blind spook like me gonna get up to anyhow?

220
00:21:38,815 --> 00:21:41,618
Lot of people go for music
around here?

221
00:21:41,775 --> 00:21:46,253
There's a couple of places just
outside of town, at the crossroads.

222
00:21:46,483 --> 00:21:49,166
A long walk? Are you in a hurry?

223
00:21:53,037 --> 00:21:57,675
How old is that box you're playing,Second one ever made.

224
00:21:57,912 --> 00:22:01,715
The devil got the first one.
How about yours?

225
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:04,805
Brand new. Made it myself.

226
00:22:04,966 --> 00:22:07,805
Ooh, brand new! Made it hisself!

227
00:22:07,964 --> 00:22:10,945
Hot dog! It's right.

228
00:22:11,111 --> 00:22:14,022
So, these clubs?

229
00:22:14,184 --> 00:22:16,923
Old Toussaint,
he runs the Ace of Spades.

230
00:22:17,078 --> 00:22:19,747
They don't have no live music
in there.

231
00:22:19,899 --> 00:22:23,057
Pine Top Purvis, he runs
the Honeydripper Lounge.

232
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,679
He don't care nothing
about no guitar.

233
00:22:25,821 --> 00:22:29,219
He won't allow one under his roof.
That don't make sense.

234
00:22:29,402 --> 00:22:33,126
Well, when a musician
put his hand to murder,

235
00:22:33,324 --> 00:22:37,287
nine times out of ten
a drummer done it.

236
00:22:37,495 --> 00:22:40,064
But Pine Top, he a piano man.

237
00:22:40,211 --> 00:22:43,529
He killed somebody?That's the story.

238
00:22:44,632 --> 00:22:48,630
But if you meet the man, you damn
well don't be asking him about it.

239
00:22:57,939 --> 00:23:00,017
HONKING

240
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:16,077
Ain't seen no mule in a long time!

241
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,668
I knew this was Alabama,
but that's the Stone Ages, man!

242
00:23:21,874 --> 00:23:23,438
Where you from, boy?

243
00:23:23,542 --> 00:23:25,072
Memphis.

244
00:23:25,175 --> 00:23:27,499
Down on your vacation?

245
00:23:27,636 --> 00:23:30,075
Got in a piece of trouble up there
with the white folks.

246
00:23:30,217 --> 00:23:31,986
Need to bide my time for a spell.

247
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:34,697
Biding your time
with them pills, man,

248
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:36,415
boss man gonna fire your ass.

249
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:39,558
Don't worry about that.
I'm a cotton-picking fool!

250
00:23:41,483 --> 00:23:43,003
You a fool all right.

251
00:23:53,704 --> 00:23:56,843
Where you from, brother bear?
Mississippi.

252
00:23:57,015 --> 00:24:00,084
Hoo! This here
is a real step-up for you!

253
00:24:00,253 --> 00:24:03,251
Folks around here have discovered
fire and whatnot!

254
00:24:06,802 --> 00:24:10,605
That trouble you in,

255
00:24:10,806 --> 00:24:13,329
have anything to do
with running your mouth?

256
00:24:13,474 --> 00:24:17,792
It had to do with somebody getting on
my nerves and I had to deal with him.

257
00:24:18,015 --> 00:24:20,237
Must have been somebody kinda puny.

258
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:22,557
As I recall, he was about your size.

259
00:24:45,467 --> 00:24:49,025
What's this place we at?
Nearest town's Harmony.

260
00:24:49,215 --> 00:24:51,339
This is Mr Silas Tugwell's place.

261
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:55,638
You better get to picking. Cotton ain't going nowhere.

262
00:24:55,784 --> 00:24:58,288
The more you get first thing
when the dew's still on it,

263
00:24:58,433 --> 00:25:00,077
the more it weighs
when it tip that scale.

264
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:05,089
You live here too?

265
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:09,713
You got my sympathies.

266
00:25:19,795 --> 00:25:22,398
Hot damn!

267
00:25:22,547 --> 00:25:24,950
What's the matter? I got a shock.

268
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,850
I thought you used to work
for the power company.

269
00:25:26,963 --> 00:25:30,451
I drove the supply truck.

270
00:25:30,638 --> 00:25:34,557
Guitar Sam ain't gonna be playing
by no candlelight.

271
00:25:36,895 --> 00:25:38,219
I smell bacon.

272
00:25:38,313 --> 00:25:42,631
You must have burned your porky ass
with that electricity!

273
00:25:44,654 --> 00:25:46,373
Breakfast's ready!

274
00:25:48,115 --> 00:25:50,679
Where your mama?She already over to the mayor's.

275
00:25:50,826 --> 00:25:54,904
She told me to make sure you eat
something before you start running 'round.

276
00:25:55,117 --> 00:25:57,726
That is a sweet woman you got.

277
00:25:57,875 --> 00:26:01,353
You got one waiting for you
if you want her. Who, Nadine?

278
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:04,983
She come in here every night
making them cow eyes at you.

279
00:26:05,169 --> 00:26:07,413
She seem like a kind
who could smother a man.

280
00:26:07,546 --> 00:26:09,036
She makes all her own clothes.

281
00:26:09,137 --> 00:26:11,136
Darlin', that's not
the kind of thing

282
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:13,303
a man cares about from a woman.

283
00:26:13,428 --> 00:26:14,877
MUSIC BLARES

284
00:26:14,976 --> 00:26:18,015
Hey, I fixed it!You ain't done no such thing.

285
00:26:18,183 --> 00:26:20,904
It just decided to come back on.
Decided? Yeah.

286
00:26:21,058 --> 00:26:23,745
Just like it decided
to switch off last night.

287
00:26:23,897 --> 00:26:25,986
You ain't even in the conversation!

288
00:26:26,113 --> 00:26:29,831
This Nadine makes some good money,
too, sewing for people.

289
00:26:30,028 --> 00:26:31,638
That woman scares me.

290
00:26:31,745 --> 00:26:34,763
Last ol' boy to give her a tumble,

291
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:37,877
Napier Carpenter,
she cooked for him.

292
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:41,799
Fixed him up all kinds
of nice, new clothes...

293
00:26:41,998 --> 00:26:43,648
I don't see no problem with that!

294
00:26:43,756 --> 00:26:45,995
Come four, five months,
a man starts to...

295
00:26:47,677 --> 00:26:50,556
Sorry, China Doll,
but this is just the way it is.

296
00:26:50,717 --> 00:26:53,326
A man gots needs.

297
00:26:53,475 --> 00:26:56,998
Looks like Nadine could
take care of those, too.

298
00:26:57,187 --> 00:27:00,466
You eat chicken every morning,
noon and night for five months,

299
00:27:00,644 --> 00:27:03,728
you get a taste
for a different kind of meat.

300
00:27:05,112 --> 00:27:09,350
Maybe I shouldn't be talking
about this in front of China Doll.

301
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:13,099
You ain't gonna say something
I haven't heard worse.

302
00:27:13,288 --> 00:27:19,524
Well, Napier goes out and has him
a pork chop or two, let's say.

303
00:27:22,463 --> 00:27:26,062
Comes back one night
from Toussaint's place,

304
00:27:26,254 --> 00:27:28,977
feeling no pain and smelling...

305
00:27:30,305 --> 00:27:33,509
.. Like pork chops,
the way a man will.

306
00:27:33,684 --> 00:27:37,887
He falls out on Nadine's couch
and commenced to snore.

307
00:27:38,105 --> 00:27:43,623
Wake up next morning, find she had taken
all his clothes off without him knowing.

308
00:27:43,898 --> 00:27:46,027
The man was dog drunk!

309
00:27:46,155 --> 00:27:48,753
Miss Nadine come back
with a skillet in her hand,

310
00:27:48,902 --> 00:27:50,232
hot grits bubbling in it.

311
00:27:50,326 --> 00:27:55,488
Says, "Baby, I got your breakfast".

312
00:27:55,748 --> 00:27:59,866
"Oh, not this morning, Nadine",
he says, sitting up.

313
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,924
"Don't think I could eat a thing."

314
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:08,867
"Well then", she says, "we can't
let this go to waste, can we?"

315
00:28:09,131 --> 00:28:13,774
and she dumped
that whole hot bubbling mess

316
00:28:14,011 --> 00:28:16,775
right in that man's lap.

317
00:28:16,931 --> 00:28:19,100
Ouch!

318
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:26,348
Then she got busy
with that hot iron on his head.

319
00:28:26,692 --> 00:28:29,455
If screams didn't bring
the neighbours in,

320
00:28:29,611 --> 00:28:31,413
she'd have killed that man.

321
00:28:31,527 --> 00:28:33,259
You've got to admit it though,

322
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:37,968
the woman is an artist when
it comes to that Singer machine.

323
00:28:38,204 --> 00:28:39,688
Excuse me.

324
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,659
Which one of you is Mr Pine Top?

325
00:28:51,222 --> 00:28:53,222
We ain't hiring.

326
00:28:54,643 --> 00:28:56,487
I can play anything.

327
00:28:56,603 --> 00:28:58,882
I already got me a professional.

328
00:29:00,775 --> 00:29:04,253
Guitar Sam really comin'
all the way down here?

329
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,203
That so surprising?

330
00:29:06,315 --> 00:29:09,444
No, no.

331
00:29:09,616 --> 00:29:13,174
Mr Shack Thomas told me... You know Shack?

332
00:29:13,364 --> 00:29:16,813
We... travelled together.

333
00:29:16,999 --> 00:29:20,398
When was the last time
you ate solid food, young man?

334
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:27,289
Take him back and fix him something,
China Doll.

335
00:29:27,505 --> 00:29:30,628
Standing there all hungry-eyed,

336
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,421
puts me off my breakfast.

337
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:36,157
That's real kind of you.

338
00:29:53,036 --> 00:29:55,715
Must've come in
on the north-bound last night.

339
00:29:55,867 --> 00:29:58,328
Looks like he got the cooties too.

340
00:29:58,471 --> 00:30:00,898
Straw in them box cars, full of 'em.

341
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,968
Never cared to travel that way.

342
00:30:03,088 --> 00:30:06,607
I was out there riding them rails
between the wars.

343
00:30:06,796 --> 00:30:08,445
Hm...

344
00:30:08,553 --> 00:30:11,771
Seen black half of the country
headin' west.

345
00:30:11,946 --> 00:30:15,095
Rode past the other half
coming back east.

346
00:30:15,268 --> 00:30:19,546
Yeah, every one of us,
scraping for the next meal.

347
00:30:21,316 --> 00:30:24,315
This is the place.
Y'all can tear things down.

348
00:30:24,481 --> 00:30:27,410
Put things up.
It's got a lot of potential.

349
00:30:27,573 --> 00:30:32,490
It looks bigger than it does from the
outside. Can I help you, gentlemen?

350
00:30:32,739 --> 00:30:36,583
I'm just showing the man who
gonna run this place what he got.

351
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,889
This is my place.

352
00:30:52,224 --> 00:30:54,228
You the piano player, right?

353
00:30:54,351 --> 00:30:58,148
My name's Tyrone.
They call me Pine Top Purvis.

354
00:30:58,349 --> 00:31:01,073
Pine Top Purvis.

355
00:31:01,227 --> 00:31:02,556
You owe 200

356
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:05,849
to Lucky Hardaway up in Little Rock.

357
00:31:06,024 --> 00:31:07,708
He gonna get his.

358
00:31:07,817 --> 00:31:10,266
Pine Top...

359
00:31:10,408 --> 00:31:13,047
You missed last month's rent.

360
00:31:13,198 --> 00:31:14,807
After this weekend.

361
00:31:14,913 --> 00:31:20,151
After this weekend, you gonna be
the same raggedy arse piano player

362
00:31:20,414 --> 00:31:22,663
who can't pay off his debts.

363
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:26,956
Mr Simmons here,
he's gonna be the new proprietor.

364
00:31:27,172 --> 00:31:28,701
Lucky give me two weeks.

365
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:32,080
Lucky got a better offer. He can't do that.

366
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,678
You don't think so?

367
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:42,326
Whoa, now!

368
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:45,404
What if we got our payments
for him Monday?

369
00:31:45,565 --> 00:31:48,329
Saturday night. We can do that.

370
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,352
Not just no taste.

371
00:31:52,489 --> 00:31:54,738
The whole 200.

372
00:31:54,871 --> 00:32:00,709
And I'll throw in a 25 cent tip
for his messenger boy.

373
00:32:00,998 --> 00:32:03,099
In the meantime,

374
00:32:03,227 --> 00:32:05,259
we're not open yet.

375
00:32:05,383 --> 00:32:07,262
That means y'all trespassing.

376
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:14,793
See enough, Mr Simmons?

377
00:32:14,928 --> 00:32:17,092
I believe I have.

378
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,839
Somebody could do something
with this place.

379
00:32:25,695 --> 00:32:27,654
Wouldn't take a whole lot of work.

380
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,803
We cleared over 200 that oneA couple of years back.

381
00:32:36,999 --> 00:32:40,238
And we didn't have no Luther on
the guitar with the playing meter.

382
00:32:40,414 --> 00:32:43,623
They say it draws them like flies. That's what they say.

383
00:32:43,798 --> 00:32:47,395
They say first thing he does
is go to the man that owns a joint,

384
00:32:47,587 --> 00:32:50,391
sticks out his hand and
watch that cash money put in it.

385
00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:52,198
I already sent 50 to his manager.

386
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:54,870
How much you paying him all out?Another hundred.

387
00:32:55,017 --> 00:32:59,455
We need to clear 300! What I figure
is if we charge folks 2 to get in,

388
00:32:59,684 --> 00:33:01,014
then the liquor...

389
00:33:01,108 --> 00:33:04,066
What I'm saying is
'less he see that green up front,

390
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,075
the man won't get off the train!

391
00:33:06,191 --> 00:33:08,155
HORN HONKS

392
00:33:09,241 --> 00:33:10,881
What's that now?

393
00:33:17,792 --> 00:33:19,710
About time you fellas run by!

394
00:33:19,829 --> 00:33:21,713
We're just about dry here!

395
00:33:21,831 --> 00:33:23,453
Boss in?

396
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,112
Tyrone?

397
00:33:25,215 --> 00:33:27,174
Whisky wagon come by.

398
00:33:31,055 --> 00:33:32,539
Y'all a day late!

399
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,564
The old man Toussaint
gonna chew me out!

400
00:33:35,727 --> 00:33:39,485
Toussaint went over
to another supplier upstate.

401
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,694
We just got you,

402
00:33:40,774 --> 00:33:44,692
then we're over to the army base
to service the officers' club.

403
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:46,862
That's 56.

404
00:33:48,698 --> 00:33:50,978
My credit no good anymore?

405
00:33:55,331 --> 00:33:57,215
Whoa, whoa. What's your hurry?

406
00:33:57,333 --> 00:34:00,331
Nobody in their right mind
sell liquor on credit,

407
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:03,341
especially not to no
dark town road house.

408
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,341
Listen, I got a special case, see.

409
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:07,230
We've got the harvest coming up.

410
00:34:07,343 --> 00:34:11,261
Soldiers at the base gonna be let
off on leave Saturday night.

411
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:15,351
Ain't enough hooch in this truck
to satisfy what we gonna sell!

412
00:34:15,555 --> 00:34:19,758
You pay as you go, that's business.

413
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:23,065
Look, you come back Monday,

414
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:28,952
get paid and take back
every damn drop that I don't sell.

415
00:34:29,236 --> 00:34:33,799
OK, we got Guitar Sam
lined up here...

416
00:34:36,498 --> 00:34:42,136
What... What if I throw in 5
up front for you fellas?

417
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:44,537
ENGINE STARTS

418
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,668
Hey! Wait.

419
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:48,759
Come on, man!

420
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:54,022
Everybody gives credit!

421
00:34:54,136 --> 00:34:55,900
It's the American way!

422
00:35:06,238 --> 00:35:10,436
Maybe we could buy some Bushead
from Willie Pettigrew.

423
00:35:10,654 --> 00:35:13,537
With that sheriff sniffing
'round me every night,

424
00:35:13,698 --> 00:35:15,902
lay my black ass in jail for good.

425
00:35:16,033 --> 00:35:17,723
Then what we gonna do?

426
00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:21,591
# Move it on over,
move it on over... #

427
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,398
Got a load of liquor
for a Mr Lucien Toussaint.

428
00:35:30,549 --> 00:35:33,198
That would be me.

429
00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:35,313
I trust he got my cheque all right.

430
00:35:35,434 --> 00:35:37,479
Don't suppose I'd be here
if they didn't.

431
00:35:37,604 --> 00:35:40,842
Pull round to the back,
we'll help you unload.

432
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:57,748
This better be some Saturday night.

433
00:35:59,501 --> 00:36:02,140
Arkansas. How about you?

434
00:36:03,255 --> 00:36:06,454
We come here just after mama
met my stepdaddy.

435
00:36:06,629 --> 00:36:09,793
Not much going on
in a little town like this.

436
00:36:11,514 --> 00:36:15,432
They started up the training base
again. Is that right?

437
00:36:20,231 --> 00:36:21,911
You been in the army?

438
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,629
Uh-huh.

439
00:36:23,735 --> 00:36:25,813
You shoot people?

440
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,984
Fixed radios.

441
00:36:33,077 --> 00:36:35,756
They say this new war
gonna be a short one.

442
00:36:35,909 --> 00:36:39,513
Might be, might not.

443
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,329
I was in Japan.

444
00:36:42,415 --> 00:36:44,704
Yeah?

445
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,120
What's the people like there?

446
00:36:47,255 --> 00:36:49,116
Small. Yeah?

447
00:36:49,233 --> 00:36:50,746
About...

448
00:36:50,848 --> 00:36:52,291
that high.

449
00:36:52,389 --> 00:36:54,309
Speak Japanese.

450
00:36:59,981 --> 00:37:01,980
You been to California?

451
00:37:02,103 --> 00:37:04,152
Los Angeles.

452
00:37:04,277 --> 00:37:08,160
Where they make the movies?
You go to movies? I've been once.

453
00:37:08,364 --> 00:37:12,802
A fine looking girl like you ought
to have been all kinds of places.

454
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:15,520
I'm going to 'em, I just...

455
00:37:15,664 --> 00:37:17,543
First I'm going to beauty school.

456
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,921
When mama saves up the money.

457
00:37:20,056 --> 00:37:22,283
Then I'll have a portable skill.

458
00:37:22,415 --> 00:37:24,424
Like playing music?

459
00:37:24,548 --> 00:37:27,027
My stepdaddy says that ain't a skill.

460
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,495
It's an affliction.

461
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,364
Come on, China Doll.

462
00:37:33,475 --> 00:37:36,434
Business in town.
You gonna help wi' it.

463
00:37:38,062 --> 00:37:42,060
And you young man, you wanna point
yourself west down that highway

464
00:37:42,269 --> 00:37:46,073
about three miles
to the people working in the field.

465
00:37:46,274 --> 00:37:48,563
It's harvest time.

466
00:37:48,698 --> 00:37:52,296
If you can stoop and pull,
they got a job for you.

467
00:37:52,488 --> 00:37:54,372
Wash up the dishes before you go.

468
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:05,726
What I need is for you
to go get friendly with Luther,

469
00:38:05,878 --> 00:38:06,967
then I just happen in.

470
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,816
We can't just ask Mr Skinner?

471
00:38:08,928 --> 00:38:11,606
Mr Skinner don't want nothing
from coloured folk,

472
00:38:11,759 --> 00:38:14,003
but they buy his goods
and shine his shoes.

473
00:38:14,136 --> 00:38:16,460
You go on ahead now.

474
00:38:31,076 --> 00:38:33,515
GUITAR STRUMMING

475
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:40,427
# It was early

476
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,744
# Friday evening

477
00:38:44,089 --> 00:38:47,768
# And the hound began to bark

478
00:38:49,011 --> 00:38:52,249
# Staggolee and Billy Lyons

479
00:38:52,425 --> 00:38:55,629
# Squabbling in the dark

480
00:38:57,853 --> 00:39:01,171
# Staggolee told Billy Lyons

481
00:39:02,358 --> 00:39:05,437
# "What do you think about that?

482
00:39:08,948 --> 00:39:11,792
# "First you take all my money

483
00:39:11,951 --> 00:39:15,790
# "Then you spits
in my Stetson hat"... #

484
00:39:19,042 --> 00:39:20,922
I hate that damn song.

485
00:39:23,089 --> 00:39:25,288
How you been keeping, Tyrone?

486
00:39:25,419 --> 00:39:27,348
Well, just...

487
00:39:27,468 --> 00:39:29,231
trying to hold it together.

488
00:39:29,344 --> 00:39:32,783
You've got your beautiful young
daughter with you this morning.

489
00:39:32,968 --> 00:39:34,372
Don't you be studying her.

490
00:39:37,019 --> 00:39:40,698
I heard tell you gonna put
on a guitar man out at your place.

491
00:39:40,893 --> 00:39:42,654
Where you hear that?

492
00:39:42,767 --> 00:39:44,494
Oh... The breeze.

493
00:39:46,237 --> 00:39:49,636
Well, this time the breeze know
what it's blowing about.

494
00:39:51,367 --> 00:39:53,931
You'd better be careful, Tyrone.

495
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,238
Cos you know what them
guitar players are like.

496
00:39:58,959 --> 00:40:00,479
You be careful yourself.

497
00:40:02,338 --> 00:40:05,615
# He shot him in the shoulder

498
00:40:07,509 --> 00:40:10,508
# Three times in the side

499
00:40:12,598 --> 00:40:14,797
# That's the last time he shot him

500
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:18,789
# Poor Billy up and died

501
00:40:18,932 --> 00:40:21,016
# Up and died. #

502
00:40:26,195 --> 00:40:27,760
The time is ripe

503
00:40:27,864 --> 00:40:30,427
and the bill is passed due.

504
00:40:30,575 --> 00:40:33,934
You know Mr Roosevelt would've
done it already, only he died.

505
00:40:34,115 --> 00:40:37,883
They don't listen to Miss Eleanor
no more but Mr Truman,

506
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:41,761
he's starting a band, especially now
that we got this war heated up.

507
00:40:41,956 --> 00:40:43,765
Brother Randolph says...

508
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:48,443
Here it comes! The gospel
according to Randolph

509
00:40:48,677 --> 00:40:52,995
Tyrone! How you doing?
Oh, got my nose above the waterline.

510
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:57,502
Here's my baby. What's up, Ty?How your mama doing, China Doll?

511
00:40:57,723 --> 00:40:59,652
She doing fine, Uncle Shack.

512
00:40:59,772 --> 00:41:02,735
I'm just telling the boys here
about how Brother Randolph

513
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:06,259
pushing this deal how boys are gonna
be a full part of the service.

514
00:41:06,441 --> 00:41:07,810
I carried a rifle in the Great War.

515
00:41:07,905 --> 00:41:10,024
Boys get in the middle
of this Korea mess,

516
00:41:10,152 --> 00:41:12,202
they ain't gonna thank you
for your efforts.

517
00:41:12,328 --> 00:41:15,886
If we want our full due in this
country, we've got to go ho ho!

518
00:41:16,076 --> 00:41:19,359
Black folk shooting yellow folk
to keep white folks happy?

519
00:41:19,537 --> 00:41:22,106
We need to move on
from that kind of thinking.

520
00:41:22,254 --> 00:41:26,532
Move right on, Shack. Then come back
and tell the rest of us how it is.

521
00:41:26,753 --> 00:41:28,157
LAUGHTER

522
00:41:30,345 --> 00:41:32,784
That's a hard headed man.

523
00:41:34,475 --> 00:41:37,718
I'd have to ask Mr Skinner.
Of course you would.

524
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:41,294
While you're at it, remind him how one
of the reasons coloured folks come here

525
00:41:41,477 --> 00:41:43,881
is to get the low-down
on what's happening.

526
00:41:44,022 --> 00:41:47,870
China doll! You gonna let us put

527
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:50,676
I don't think that will be
any problem at all.

528
00:41:50,825 --> 00:41:54,383
That's awful nice of you, Luther. You're looking special today.

529
00:41:54,574 --> 00:41:56,623
That's sweet of you to say.

530
00:41:56,748 --> 00:41:58,872
Maceo, you go with the man here,

531
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,444
he'll show you where
to put these up.

532
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:04,665
Darling, we've got a lot
of more places to go.

533
00:42:04,835 --> 00:42:06,879
Nice to see you, Luther!

534
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:17,649
You've got that boy
eating out of your hand!

535
00:42:17,806 --> 00:42:20,570
Luther is the only one
didn't pull my hair,

536
00:42:20,726 --> 00:42:22,695
he sat behind me in Sunday school.

537
00:42:22,817 --> 00:42:27,015
I hope you got a little of that sugar left, cos
we got to spare some on Miss Bertha Mae Spivey.

538
00:42:27,233 --> 00:42:30,254
You gonna ask her to come singI'm gonna ask her for money.

539
00:42:30,421 --> 00:42:33,407
Word is, she got a whole pile
of it squirrelled away.

540
00:42:33,572 --> 00:42:37,575
Daddy... Hey, come on, girl,I got to rest.

541
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:44,314
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

542
00:42:44,506 --> 00:42:46,025
You catch your breath, OK.

543
00:42:46,128 --> 00:42:48,332
Yeah.

544
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:52,833
So why Miss Spivey
gonna give you money,

545
00:42:53,015 --> 00:42:55,574
if you won't let her sing
at the club no more?

546
00:42:55,721 --> 00:42:58,245
I'm gonna make her partner. Partner in what?

547
00:42:58,391 --> 00:42:59,840
The Honeydripper.

548
00:42:59,939 --> 00:43:04,257
But all you ever say, it's just
a hole you pour good money into.

549
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,084
It don't matter.
I'm gonna make her proprietor.

550
00:43:07,233 --> 00:43:10,476
Tress. Like waiter and waitress.

551
00:43:12,201 --> 00:43:14,046
Proprietress.

552
00:43:14,162 --> 00:43:16,361
She got to like the sound of that.

553
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:23,424
Lovely ladies out to make a purchase.

554
00:43:23,589 --> 00:43:26,548
Is that the same Guitar Sam isThe very one.

555
00:43:26,712 --> 00:43:28,321
What does he look like?

556
00:43:28,427 --> 00:43:33,305
A fine looking man,
a real lady killer from what I hear.

557
00:43:33,552 --> 00:43:35,841
Got that New Orleans style to him.

558
00:43:35,977 --> 00:43:37,461
Well, you ought to have
a picture up there.

559
00:43:37,561 --> 00:43:40,040
We'll be getting some of those
when he come in on the train.

560
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:44,426
Main thing is,
the man is electrifying

561
00:43:44,646 --> 00:43:46,490
and you know what that means.

562
00:43:46,606 --> 00:43:48,691
OK.

563
00:43:50,867 --> 00:43:55,230
Make like we just come by
to see how how she keeping.

564
00:43:55,455 --> 00:43:59,613
Then I'll kind of mention I'd been
thinking of bringing her on as a partner.

565
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,440
Left the door open.

566
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:18,310
She gone.

567
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:23,867
Oh. When she going to be back?

568
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:27,339
She just gone.

569
00:44:32,785 --> 00:44:34,304
Woke up beside her.

570
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:54,618
Oh, damn.

571
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,204
24 years.

572
00:44:57,853 --> 00:44:59,937
China doll, go find your mama.

573
00:45:00,063 --> 00:45:01,822
She'll know how to fix up the body.

574
00:45:07,613 --> 00:45:09,772
Laugh and all but...

575
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:14,167
.. I've been with that woman
24 years.

576
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:18,286
She gave me the only home
I ever had.

577
00:45:22,546 --> 00:45:23,985
What am I gonna do now?

578
00:45:49,907 --> 00:45:51,946
What's your hurry, boy?

579
00:45:53,744 --> 00:45:55,224
No hurry.

580
00:45:56,331 --> 00:45:58,210
Take your hat off.

581
00:46:00,793 --> 00:46:02,452
Where you headed?

582
00:46:02,561 --> 00:46:04,151
I'm looking for work.

583
00:46:04,256 --> 00:46:06,175
You're not from around here?

584
00:46:06,294 --> 00:46:08,143
No, sir.

585
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:11,198
Stranger wandering around, no job,

586
00:46:11,361 --> 00:46:14,265
that would make you a vagrant.

587
00:46:14,427 --> 00:46:16,431
But I'm looking.

588
00:46:18,228 --> 00:46:20,627
I got a job for you.
Get in the back.

589
00:46:44,131 --> 00:46:46,135
I can always use another hand.

590
00:46:46,258 --> 00:46:51,215
Well, I caught this young fella in
flagrant violation of the statutes -

591
00:46:51,466 --> 00:46:53,590
gawkery, with intent to mope.

592
00:46:55,266 --> 00:46:56,831
What's he going to run me?

593
00:46:56,935 --> 00:46:59,819
3 a day, plus you feed him lunch.

594
00:46:59,981 --> 00:47:03,579
The sentence, that all depends on how
long you're gonna need the help?

595
00:47:03,771 --> 00:47:05,580
I don't get any trial?

596
00:47:05,694 --> 00:47:09,653
Sure you do, boy, and a speedy
one at that. Meet the judge.

597
00:47:09,861 --> 00:47:11,762
Judge Gatlin.

598
00:47:11,881 --> 00:47:13,748
Grab a sack.

599
00:47:18,249 --> 00:47:21,408
Oh dear, I believe
it's about that time.

600
00:47:24,506 --> 00:47:26,625
Would you care to join me?
No, thank you.

601
00:47:29,386 --> 00:47:31,865
Of course you won't join me,
you don't partake.

602
00:47:32,008 --> 00:47:34,771
That was thoughtless of me.

603
00:47:34,927 --> 00:47:36,892
No, that's all right.

604
00:47:40,105 --> 00:47:46,263
So, you don't take spirits
and what else in your church?

605
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:52,313
I'm sort of between churchesOh.

606
00:47:52,535 --> 00:47:57,773
I've been thinking about
changing over to the Holiness,

607
00:47:58,036 --> 00:48:00,120
but I haven't been sanctified yet.

608
00:48:00,246 --> 00:48:01,530
Oh.

609
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:09,648
There's been a minister
in this week.

610
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:12,363
The tent over by the fairgrounds?

611
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:18,709
The church I was raised in,
we were Pentecostals.

612
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:26,277
They wouldn't have anything but
the human voice inside the church.

613
00:48:26,566 --> 00:48:30,289
Dancing, any kind of dancing,

614
00:48:30,486 --> 00:48:32,308
music, card-playing.

615
00:48:32,423 --> 00:48:34,210
It was very strict.

616
00:48:37,332 --> 00:48:39,490
They took up serpents.

617
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:41,190
I heard of that.

618
00:48:41,294 --> 00:48:45,852
I tell Floyd these stories,
and he's... He's horrified.

619
00:48:47,008 --> 00:48:50,332
They have always been Methodists,
Floyd's family.

620
00:48:50,512 --> 00:48:53,551
It can be a trial, married folks
differ in their religion.

621
00:48:53,719 --> 00:48:56,363
And your husband is a...?

622
00:48:59,479 --> 00:49:01,084
Unaffiliated.

623
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:03,709
Unaffiliated, I see.

624
00:49:06,279 --> 00:49:09,162
But he has his social club.

625
00:49:09,323 --> 00:49:12,882
The Honeydripper?That is such a colourful name.

626
00:49:13,072 --> 00:49:14,555
Yes.

627
00:49:17,915 --> 00:49:22,673
He must have a great deal
of his energy to it.

628
00:49:22,915 --> 00:49:25,204
It's just him
and Maceo Green runs it,

629
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:28,783
I go over and cook some
after I get off here.

630
00:49:28,968 --> 00:49:34,326
Well, that's very supportive of you,
considering the sort of environment.

631
00:49:34,594 --> 00:49:38,238
I've been in those bar rooms
most of my life, Miss Amanda.

632
00:49:40,147 --> 00:49:42,426
I see.

633
00:49:49,532 --> 00:49:51,370
I was a singer.

634
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:56,357
I met Tyrone in the Paradise,
down in Treefork.

635
00:49:56,533 --> 00:49:58,458
China doll was only two.

636
00:50:00,126 --> 00:50:02,850
And I was just...

637
00:50:03,004 --> 00:50:05,882
living alone, you know,

638
00:50:06,043 --> 00:50:08,887
drinking more than I ought,

639
00:50:09,046 --> 00:50:10,731
and then Tyrone...

640
00:50:12,389 --> 00:50:15,553
.. Like a light, come into my life.

641
00:50:15,726 --> 00:50:19,164
People think things
cos he owns the lounge,

642
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,793
but they don't know him.

643
00:50:23,485 --> 00:50:26,363
Small minds are never
in short supply.

644
00:50:28,113 --> 00:50:30,392
People in this town...

645
00:50:36,622 --> 00:50:42,420
I suppose they expected that Floyd,
being from a prominent family,

646
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:47,510
as prominent as is possible
here in Harmony,

647
00:50:47,754 --> 00:50:51,197
would have chosen somebody more...

648
00:50:56,810 --> 00:50:59,769
In school,
if you didn't have shoes...

649
00:51:06,403 --> 00:51:09,202
Oh, I forgot!

650
00:51:23,379 --> 00:51:26,798
I was going through some of Emily's
old things the other day.

651
00:51:26,982 --> 00:51:30,366
I thought this would look
just darling on your China Doll.

652
00:51:32,181 --> 00:51:35,140
Oh, I don't think that would
near fit her, Miss Amanda.

653
00:51:35,304 --> 00:51:38,067
Why, how old is she, now?

654
00:51:38,223 --> 00:51:40,068
17.

655
00:51:41,189 --> 00:51:42,669
Oh, my...

656
00:51:45,194 --> 00:51:48,512
I must have lost track
somewhere along the line.

657
00:51:48,692 --> 00:51:50,301
17?

658
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:53,086
It was a very nice thought.

659
00:51:54,829 --> 00:51:57,468
Mama, mama, they need you...

660
00:51:59,793 --> 00:52:00,797
Oh, I'm sorry.

661
00:52:00,876 --> 00:52:05,639
Miss Amanda, I didn't knowChina Doll!

662
00:52:05,882 --> 00:52:09,761
We were just recalling
how you used to play right here,

663
00:52:09,965 --> 00:52:11,289
under this table.

664
00:52:13,432 --> 00:52:16,430
There's not any cash money
that I know of.

665
00:52:16,596 --> 00:52:19,525
She sold a good deal
of the furniture,

666
00:52:19,688 --> 00:52:23,366
but there's still a nice looking
couch in the parlour.

667
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:28,753
Didn't care about too much,

668
00:52:28,947 --> 00:52:31,286
other than singing
at the Pine Top's place.

669
00:52:31,424 --> 00:52:33,655
You're welcome to look
around the house,

670
00:52:33,788 --> 00:52:35,950
if there's anything
your missus might like.

671
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,159
As long as it's not something
personal to me and Bertha Mae.

672
00:52:39,329 --> 00:52:42,492
It's just...

673
00:52:43,671 --> 00:52:45,310
She's got to go out in style.

674
00:53:32,972 --> 00:53:36,371
You ain't never done this job before?
Can't say I have.

675
00:53:38,102 --> 00:53:43,820
You want to set your pins out wide,
bend over at the hip.

676
00:53:44,104 --> 00:53:47,067
Don't be bobbing up and down
all the time.

677
00:53:47,232 --> 00:53:48,802
When you're up, be up.

678
00:53:48,906 --> 00:53:51,825
When you're on the roll, stay down.

679
00:53:51,988 --> 00:53:55,076
But most important,

680
00:53:55,246 --> 00:53:57,570
you got to get a rhythm.

681
00:53:57,707 --> 00:54:02,665
Everything in life got a rhythm,
even pulling cotton off the plant.

682
00:54:02,915 --> 00:54:06,843
Lay it out for me. Not my rhythm, your rhythm.

683
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:10,828
That's between you and the day
and the work you got before you.

684
00:54:11,028 --> 00:54:14,771
Once you get it, don't let nothing
or nobody push you off it.

685
00:54:14,969 --> 00:54:17,498
I'm going so slow.

686
00:54:17,644 --> 00:54:20,683
Are you getting paid
by the pound or by the hour?

687
00:54:20,851 --> 00:54:23,552
I ain't getting paid at all,
none of us are.

688
00:54:23,705 --> 00:54:26,337
I suggest you work that
into your rhythm too.

689
00:54:26,487 --> 00:54:29,205
Let's see more picking and
less talking over there.

690
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:30,924
Getting right to it, boss.

691
00:54:50,803 --> 00:54:52,682
Them boys frying over there.

692
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,609
That's just Gatlin's gang.

693
00:54:54,724 --> 00:54:58,528
He works them people from can
into cane, every damn day.

694
00:54:58,729 --> 00:55:01,407
When the fields get picked,
he bid 'em out to the neighbours.

695
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:03,249
Harvest time come around here,

696
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:06,717
you'd better sign with somebody
fast, or get out of sight.

697
00:55:09,114 --> 00:55:10,813
I ate a pick of dust today.

698
00:55:10,923 --> 00:55:12,553
Why don't you get some water?

699
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:15,304
The only thing that wash out
the dust is whisky.

700
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:19,733
Ain't enough whisky in this world to
wash out what I swallowed in my life.

701
00:55:19,954 --> 00:55:22,517
What are we playing for?Two bits of ham.

702
00:55:22,664 --> 00:55:24,833
Woo! That's awful steep, ain't it?

703
00:55:24,964 --> 00:55:28,048
Well... I remember playing
this game one night,

704
00:55:28,217 --> 00:55:31,695
Memphis's boss Crumpstown folks
is gambling before they can walk,

705
00:55:31,882 --> 00:55:33,212
caught me a winning streak

706
00:55:33,306 --> 00:55:37,164
that cleaned out half
the sporting men on Beale Street.

707
00:55:37,368 --> 00:55:41,191
I got up from that table,
my money was long as train smoke.

708
00:55:41,392 --> 00:55:42,957
What happened to it?

709
00:55:45,069 --> 00:55:47,588
I spent it all on fine-looking women.

710
00:55:54,453 --> 00:55:58,211
Yo, Mississippi!
His name is Hamilton. Hambo!

711
00:56:00,668 --> 00:56:02,507
You want in on this?

712
00:56:02,623 --> 00:56:04,624
Settle up on pay day.

713
00:56:04,747 --> 00:56:06,714
That your deck of cards?

714
00:56:07,842 --> 00:56:09,486
What if it is?

715
00:56:09,594 --> 00:56:13,197
I'll stay clear of it then.

716
00:56:13,389 --> 00:56:17,508
Are you insinuating? I'm just saying,

717
00:56:30,533 --> 00:56:32,411
Looks like dinner.

718
00:56:32,529 --> 00:56:34,338
A rabbit is a rodent.

719
00:56:34,453 --> 00:56:37,372
A man eat a rabbit,
might as well eat a rat.

720
00:56:37,534 --> 00:56:38,943
Simple country nigger,

721
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:42,520
afraid to sit down and lose
a little handful of change.

722
00:56:42,707 --> 00:56:44,871
He awful big to mess with.

723
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:46,930
Don't scare me none.

724
00:56:47,049 --> 00:56:50,807
I'm a stepping razor, man.
I'm trouble on two legs.

725
00:56:53,431 --> 00:56:56,630
Your draw, Junebug. Don't be
dripping no sweat on my cards.

726
00:56:56,805 --> 00:56:59,374
HONKING

727
00:56:59,521 --> 00:57:01,040
Excuse me folks!

728
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:06,522
Look here!

729
00:57:06,654 --> 00:57:10,771
Y'all heard about the show
we puttin' on at the Honeydripper.

730
00:57:10,985 --> 00:57:13,146
Saturday night.

731
00:57:13,276 --> 00:57:15,403
We got Guitar Sam!

732
00:57:19,542 --> 00:57:22,626
I expect there'll be a nice turnout
for Bertha Mae tomorrow.

733
00:57:22,795 --> 00:57:27,033
Yes, folks who wouldn't have nothing
to do with her when she was alive.

734
00:57:27,253 --> 00:57:29,022
Some of them, maybe.

735
00:57:29,135 --> 00:57:30,854
Still got to pay your respects.

736
00:57:32,847 --> 00:57:36,526
That Slick is gonna have
to find him a new ride.

737
00:57:36,721 --> 00:57:38,250
That's a terrible thing to say.

738
00:57:38,353 --> 00:57:40,277
That's how the man gets over,
is all.

739
00:57:40,397 --> 00:57:45,475
Always sugaring up to some woman
who's got a job or a bankroll.

740
00:57:45,731 --> 00:57:47,136
That's no way to live.

741
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:50,419
Society is in whirl, baby.

742
00:57:51,533 --> 00:57:55,251
A man's gotta walk through the gates
of hell to get a piece of cheese.

743
00:57:58,123 --> 00:57:59,923
Not so young any more...

744
00:58:01,585 --> 00:58:04,189
.. Lose hold of what little he's got.

745
00:58:04,338 --> 00:58:07,017
If you lose the club,
I'm sure you'll find something else.

746
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:10,578
In this town, like what?

747
00:58:10,762 --> 00:58:15,000
You know, any time you want,
I could get Miss Amanda to ask...

748
00:58:15,219 --> 00:58:17,021
Watch your feet, Mr Mayor!

749
00:58:17,136 --> 00:58:18,868
I just done mopped the floor.

750
00:58:18,979 --> 00:58:23,036
Ty, you work so hard at the lodge,
but what you bring in is...

751
00:58:23,248 --> 00:58:27,271
Not even as much as you make
polishing that white lady's silver.

752
00:58:36,956 --> 00:58:38,695
I didn't say that.

753
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:40,510
You didn't have to.

754
00:58:42,836 --> 00:58:44,995
It'll just have to work out, then.

755
00:58:49,135 --> 00:58:51,174
Meeting gonna start
and I'm not there.

756
00:58:55,433 --> 00:58:57,792
Your soul's not the one
needs saving, baby.

757
00:59:13,494 --> 00:59:16,098
It's all gonna be fine, Daddy.

758
00:59:16,247 --> 00:59:19,605
Everybody in town talking about
Guitar Sam coming to Harmony.

759
00:59:22,127 --> 00:59:28,365
# As I walked
all along this highway

760
00:59:30,303 --> 00:59:33,821
# I was seeking

761
00:59:34,009 --> 00:59:36,730
# My Lord each day

762
00:59:36,885 --> 00:59:40,767
# She left me standing

763
00:59:40,971 --> 00:59:44,783
# Out on this highway

764
00:59:44,984 --> 00:59:53,621
# Oh, just wondering
which way I must go

765
00:59:54,031 --> 00:59:57,272
# She left me standing

766
00:59:57,449 --> 01:00:00,620
# Out on this highway

767
01:00:00,793 --> 01:00:11,868
# Oh, just wondering
which way I must go. #

768
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:17,088
Amen! Amen! Sing on, choir!

769
01:00:17,284 --> 01:00:20,947
Amen! Let the church say Amen.

770
01:00:21,142 --> 01:00:23,151
Amen!

771
01:00:23,274 --> 01:00:26,073
Let the church say Amen! Amen!

772
01:00:26,903 --> 01:00:28,023
Amen!

773
01:00:30,449 --> 01:00:31,728
Amen!

774
01:00:33,327 --> 01:00:37,045
She left him standing
out on the highway,

775
01:00:37,242 --> 01:00:40,006
wondering which way to go.

776
01:00:40,162 --> 01:00:41,531
Yeah.

777
01:00:41,627 --> 01:00:45,791
The highway of life.

778
01:00:46,007 --> 01:00:50,504
Sisters and brothers, it will twist
you and it will turn ya.

779
01:00:50,735 --> 01:00:55,198
It will run you this-a-way,
and it will run you that-a-way.

780
01:00:55,428 --> 01:00:56,397
Yeah.

781
01:00:56,475 --> 01:00:59,394
Tempt you with many a detour.

782
01:00:59,557 --> 01:01:00,527
Yeah.

783
01:01:00,605 --> 01:01:06,642
Because the highway of life
is designed to lead us astray.

784
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:08,510
Yeah.

785
01:01:08,614 --> 01:01:12,932
That's not the road that we want
to be on, brothers and sisters.

786
01:01:13,155 --> 01:01:16,598
That's not the path
that we need to follow.

787
01:01:16,783 --> 01:01:20,552
We need to be on that other road.

788
01:01:20,752 --> 01:01:26,754
We need to be on that road
that leads to glory.

789
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:30,847
We need to be on that road
that leads to the right hand of God.

790
01:01:31,047 --> 01:01:33,212
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

791
01:01:34,557 --> 01:01:38,615
# That thoroughfare
I'm talking about

792
01:01:38,827 --> 01:01:42,851
# That righteous road
we need to travel

793
01:01:43,061 --> 01:01:47,221
# It's called the highway to heaven

794
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:51,528
# It is called
the highway to heaven

795
01:01:51,742 --> 01:01:54,621
# But we need to know,
sisters and brothers

796
01:01:54,782 --> 01:01:57,626
# We need to know
Who is walking beside ya.

797
01:01:57,785 --> 01:02:00,826
# You got to be wary of who
is tryin'

798
01:02:00,994 --> 01:02:03,965
# To hold you back
from your journey

799
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:08,892
# Cos many a loved ones
got to be left behind

800
01:02:09,134 --> 01:02:13,417
# Cos even on the road,
you're lost in the wilderness

801
01:02:13,639 --> 01:02:19,437
# You're either headin' for glory
or you're doomed for damnation

802
01:02:19,724 --> 01:02:23,247
# You're either with the Lord
or you're with the devil.

803
01:02:23,436 --> 01:02:25,246
# And there ain't no in-between.

804
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:29,198
# No, no,
there ain't no in-between. #

805
01:02:29,401 --> 01:02:32,085
Praise the Lord!

806
01:02:32,237 --> 01:02:34,521
APPLAUSE

807
01:02:43,336 --> 01:02:44,856
Charleston. Yeah.

808
01:02:48,508 --> 01:02:51,432
Tulsa. Tulsa ain't so bad.

809
01:02:51,595 --> 01:02:55,553
But for the spit.
Got them stockyards near the jail.

810
01:02:55,761 --> 01:02:57,291
Them flies.

811
01:02:57,394 --> 01:03:00,352
Course, I had me in a cell
in Georgia once.

812
01:03:00,516 --> 01:03:03,440
Six other men,
didn't have a one doing tall.

813
01:03:03,603 --> 01:03:06,492
Must've got caught hoppin'Yeah.

814
01:03:06,653 --> 01:03:09,377
Ain't no free ride
allowed through Georgia.

815
01:03:09,531 --> 01:03:12,490
And the food there? Paltry. Paltry ain't the word for it.

816
01:03:12,655 --> 01:03:15,578
Breakfast is a joke.
And lunch is a rumour...

817
01:03:15,741 --> 01:03:18,122
And dinner was a anecdote!

818
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:20,572
< Do it the hard way, brother!

819
01:03:20,708 --> 01:03:23,427
You got locked in that box.
Or one just like it.

820
01:03:25,714 --> 01:03:28,493
# Wake up in the morning

821
01:03:28,649 --> 01:03:31,393
# Hear the bing bong ring

822
01:03:32,721 --> 01:03:35,240
# Walk up to the table

823
01:03:35,386 --> 01:03:38,227
# See the same damn thing

824
01:03:38,386 --> 01:03:41,329
# What am I gonna tell you

825
01:03:41,493 --> 01:03:44,446
# Fork, a knife, and a pan

826
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:47,568
# If you say a thing about it

827
01:03:47,732 --> 01:03:50,833
# You in trouble with the man.

828
01:03:51,004 --> 01:03:53,996
# Let the Midnight Special

829
01:03:54,161 --> 01:03:57,084
# Shine its light on me

830
01:03:57,247 --> 01:04:00,090
# Well, let the Midnight Special

831
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:03,769
# Shine its ever-loving light
on me. #

832
01:04:03,957 --> 01:04:05,201
You a singer, young man?

833
01:04:05,292 --> 01:04:07,094
Yeah, I'm a singer.

834
01:04:07,208 --> 01:04:08,940
I'm a guitar player.

835
01:04:09,051 --> 01:04:12,929
I'm gonna be on the radio someday,
people are gonna know my name.

836
01:04:13,133 --> 01:04:16,062
You keep on thinking
that way, young man.

837
01:04:16,226 --> 01:04:19,944
If Judge Gatlin don't choose
to work you into your grave,

838
01:04:20,141 --> 01:04:21,546
you just might do it.

839
01:04:32,283 --> 01:04:35,727
# If you ever go to Houston

840
01:04:35,912 --> 01:04:38,231
# Don't you stagger
Don't you fight

841
01:04:39,833 --> 01:04:42,732
# Cos the sheriff will arrest you

842
01:04:42,893 --> 01:04:45,757
# You're in the cooler
for the night

843
01:04:45,918 --> 01:04:49,162
# He'll tie your hands together

844
01:04:49,338 --> 01:04:52,499
# And he'll bring you down

845
01:04:52,672 --> 01:04:55,798
# Throw you in the black river

846
01:04:55,970 --> 01:04:58,414
# Penitentiary bound. #

847
01:05:52,659 --> 01:05:54,978
# Early this morning

848
01:05:56,663 --> 01:06:00,102
# I heard the lonesome
church bell toll

849
01:06:09,051 --> 01:06:11,295
# Early this morning

850
01:06:11,428 --> 01:06:15,707
# I heard the low down
church bell toll

851
01:06:24,149 --> 01:06:26,788
# It brought me the sad news

852
01:06:27,904 --> 01:06:31,262
# My Bertha Mae was dead and gone

853
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:42,947
# Never miss my baby

854
01:06:44,171 --> 01:06:47,530
# I never missed her
till she left my door... #

855
01:06:49,343 --> 01:06:53,102
First, he passed away,
and the seed was no more...

856
01:06:56,142 --> 01:06:59,600
# I never missed my baby

857
01:06:59,786 --> 01:07:03,210
# Until she left my door

858
01:07:11,783 --> 01:07:13,742
# It breaks my heart

859
01:07:15,454 --> 01:07:19,577
# Think I never see her face
no more. #

860
01:07:19,792 --> 01:07:24,310
He will dwell within, he will
wipe every tear from their eyes.

861
01:07:25,631 --> 01:07:31,588
Death shall be no more, mourning
and dying and pain shall be no more.

862
01:07:32,973 --> 01:07:36,890
To the first things
that passed away,

863
01:07:37,095 --> 01:07:39,576
I am the Alpha and the Omega,

864
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:42,167
the beginning and the end...

865
01:08:30,698 --> 01:08:33,537
I hear tell Miss Bertha Mae passed.

866
01:08:36,121 --> 01:08:38,005
That's right.

867
01:08:38,123 --> 01:08:40,262
Yeah, she lived it.

868
01:08:40,391 --> 01:08:42,496
Just like she sang it.

869
01:08:49,384 --> 01:08:51,383
You waiting on somebody?

870
01:08:56,475 --> 01:09:00,673
Ain't nobody on that train
gonna change your luck, Tyrone.

871
01:09:00,891 --> 01:09:04,015
You're gonna have to save
your own self.

872
01:09:04,187 --> 01:09:06,071
What do you know about anything?

873
01:09:06,188 --> 01:09:08,349
Oh, nothing much.

874
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,802
But I know you.

875
01:09:10,939 --> 01:09:13,202
From way back.

876
01:09:13,337 --> 01:09:15,566
GUITAR STRUMS

877
01:09:21,377 --> 01:09:23,736
# Mm...

878
01:09:36,767 --> 01:09:38,706
# Oh...

879
01:09:38,827 --> 01:09:40,731
# Oh

880
01:10:00,917 --> 01:10:03,916
TRAIN HORN BLOWS

881
01:10:07,632 --> 01:10:11,031
TRAIN HORN CONTINUES

882
01:10:26,986 --> 01:10:29,950
Mournful end for a wayward sinner.

883
01:10:30,114 --> 01:10:33,753
She always seemed
at peace with herself.

884
01:10:33,947 --> 01:10:35,648
The company she kept?

885
01:10:35,758 --> 01:10:37,424
The life she lived?

886
01:10:39,623 --> 01:10:42,782
I never know Bertha Mae
to do hurt to a living soul.

887
01:10:45,505 --> 01:10:47,484
We're all hoping to see you get over

888
01:10:47,606 --> 01:10:49,550
and accept the Lord tonight,
Delilah.

889
01:10:50,928 --> 01:10:53,452
I'm hoping so too.

890
01:10:53,597 --> 01:10:56,875
You've been lingering at
the threshold long enough, sister.

891
01:10:57,054 --> 01:10:58,739
Time to step ahead.

892
01:11:39,144 --> 01:11:42,023
Tyrone! You got somebody
getting off here?

893
01:11:42,184 --> 01:11:44,985
Supposed to be. Well, what's the party's name?

894
01:11:45,143 --> 01:11:47,910
Sam? Guitar Sam.
Don't know his birth name.

895
01:11:48,066 --> 01:11:50,150
He's coming here? Uh-huh.

896
01:11:52,324 --> 01:11:54,928
Yo, Matt!
Guitar Sam get on this train?

897
01:11:55,077 --> 01:11:58,076
Nah, man, he's in the hospital
back in Little Rock.

898
01:11:58,243 --> 01:12:00,212
Hospital? You know music folks.

899
01:12:00,333 --> 01:12:04,251
Whatever he was doing, he must
have been doing too much of it.

900
01:12:04,457 --> 01:12:07,581
Brother, maybe... Maybe he
come on in tomorrow, huh?

901
01:12:09,968 --> 01:12:11,687
Matt!

902
01:12:15,558 --> 01:12:17,317
All aboard!

903
01:12:31,198 --> 01:12:33,318
Somebody didn't show up!

904
01:12:38,789 --> 01:12:41,948
We should have made you dumb
instead of blind.

905
01:13:04,817 --> 01:13:07,096
# I done had my fun

906
01:13:09,947 --> 01:13:12,466
# If I don't get well no more

907
01:13:19,374 --> 01:13:22,173
# I said, I done had my fun

908
01:13:25,672 --> 01:13:28,351
# If I don't get well no more

909
01:13:35,391 --> 01:13:37,430
# My head is spinning

910
01:13:40,397 --> 01:13:43,594
# And I's going down real slow. #

911
01:13:58,247 --> 01:14:00,886
A man don't take care of himself...

912
01:14:03,169 --> 01:14:06,848
.. With drinking and jazz and women
every night.

913
01:14:07,924 --> 01:14:09,724
Don't make no difference now.

914
01:14:11,804 --> 01:14:14,328
It got so bad,

915
01:14:14,474 --> 01:14:19,671
I heard there was this old boy goes
round pretending to be Guitar Sam.

916
01:14:19,932 --> 01:14:21,896
Fill out the gigs he misses.

917
01:14:23,565 --> 01:14:27,284
He does pretty well for himself,
what I hearing.

918
01:14:27,481 --> 01:14:28,845
Somebody we could find?

919
01:14:30,906 --> 01:14:34,185
Hell, I don't know,
just some story I heard.

920
01:14:41,585 --> 01:14:44,224
Must have been the first one.

921
01:14:44,374 --> 01:14:46,583
First what?

922
01:14:46,715 --> 01:14:51,153
Back in slavery days, them's the
one that work in the big house.

923
01:14:51,382 --> 01:14:54,310
Might not have had shoes always,

924
01:14:54,473 --> 01:14:57,911
the pants didn't have no holes in
them, they didn't pick no cotton.

925
01:14:58,096 --> 01:15:02,197
House niggers. Yeah, that's how they call them.

926
01:15:02,411 --> 01:15:06,477
They had all their
African kinds of instruments.

927
01:15:06,689 --> 01:15:11,332
Drums, shakers,
some kind of banjo thing.

928
01:15:11,569 --> 01:15:12,938
But the piano...

929
01:15:13,034 --> 01:15:16,833
They didn't bring no piano
over on those ships from Africa.

930
01:15:17,033 --> 01:15:19,482
The piano was just sitting there,

931
01:15:19,625 --> 01:15:22,503
in the white folks' big room,
all polished up.

932
01:15:24,255 --> 01:15:26,934
I'd figure this...

933
01:15:27,086 --> 01:15:28,895
first one...

934
01:15:29,009 --> 01:15:33,166
He must have passed by
15, 20 times a day.

935
01:15:33,383 --> 01:15:35,592
Run the corner of his eyes over it.

936
01:15:35,724 --> 01:15:38,083
You see,
he was there when they'd play.

937
01:15:38,221 --> 01:15:40,322
The masters.

938
01:15:40,449 --> 01:15:43,741
Their minuets.

939
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:47,178
PLAYS A MINUET

940
01:15:54,702 --> 01:15:59,580
Him standing there,
with a tray of white people's food.

941
01:15:59,827 --> 01:16:03,151
Pretending not to have
a thought in his head.

942
01:16:03,331 --> 01:16:05,780
But he...

943
01:16:05,923 --> 01:16:07,966
He's watching them fingers.

944
01:16:08,091 --> 01:16:10,910
He's watching where them keys were.

945
01:16:11,068 --> 01:16:13,817
See, this old boy, the first one,

946
01:16:13,972 --> 01:16:18,090
he knows how to play all
them kinds of African instruments.

947
01:16:18,305 --> 01:16:21,748
He could play mud if you
gave him a key and a tempo.

948
01:16:21,933 --> 01:16:25,134
Yeah, he got music in his head
and his heart.

949
01:16:25,309 --> 01:16:28,476
In every damn piece of him
there's music.

950
01:16:28,649 --> 01:16:30,413
Then one day...

951
01:16:32,074 --> 01:16:34,118
.. The master's away.

952
01:16:34,243 --> 01:16:37,802
And he alone in that room,

953
01:16:37,992 --> 01:16:39,654
with that piano.

954
01:16:39,763 --> 01:16:41,276
Watch out now.

955
01:16:41,378 --> 01:16:42,821
And he goes over

956
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:45,598
and he sits down on the bench.

957
01:16:49,133 --> 01:16:55,176
And he spreads his fingers over it,

958
01:16:55,474 --> 01:16:58,153
the way he's seen
that minuet player do.

959
01:16:58,305 --> 01:16:59,789
And he thinks...

960
01:17:00,896 --> 01:17:03,495
PLAYS CHORD

961
01:17:07,528 --> 01:17:08,688
And he thinks...

962
01:17:11,824 --> 01:17:13,584
.. "Lord help me."

963
01:17:15,286 --> 01:17:18,724
"I could do some damage
with this thing."

964
01:17:18,910 --> 01:17:22,313
I would have liked
to have been there.

965
01:17:25,338 --> 01:17:27,697
I mean...

966
01:17:29,133 --> 01:17:31,892
Just to hear the cat play.

967
01:17:47,403 --> 01:17:48,922
Mace...

968
01:17:52,242 --> 01:17:54,446
I'm gonna lose my club.

969
01:17:54,577 --> 01:18:00,054
If old man Toussaint find out
you stole his liquor,

970
01:18:00,328 --> 01:18:03,132
you're likely to lose
more than that.

971
01:18:03,289 --> 01:18:05,418
I got no more cards to play.

972
01:18:05,547 --> 01:18:09,265
If you was to go down
to see Lucky Hardaway in person...

973
01:18:09,462 --> 01:18:13,146
I ain't kissing up to no cokey-nose,
coke-headed asshole!

974
01:18:21,563 --> 01:18:24,322
What the hell that supposed to be?

975
01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:36,603
Some kind of guitar.

976
01:18:36,745 --> 01:18:40,263
A guitar got a hole in it.
That's how the sound come out.

977
01:18:40,452 --> 01:18:43,753
That boy must be three bricks shy
of a load upstairs.

978
01:18:43,932 --> 01:18:47,164
Daddy! They've gone and
arrested him! Arrest who?

979
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:50,099
Sonny! The High Sheriff arrested him
and sold him to Judge Gatlin!

980
01:18:50,255 --> 01:18:53,023
Sonny who?! Sonny that was
here yesterday morning!

981
01:18:53,179 --> 01:18:56,298
Sonny that got a screw loose?
That's why they arrested him!

982
01:18:56,469 --> 01:19:00,313
Mace? Play something on that,
make some noise there.

983
01:19:00,516 --> 01:19:02,360
GUITAR STRUMS

984
01:19:03,607 --> 01:19:05,851
It's electric.

985
01:19:05,985 --> 01:19:08,824
I could plug a chunk of stovewood
in a wall and it'd get more music

986
01:19:08,983 --> 01:19:12,191
than you'd get out of that mess!Nah, man.

987
01:19:12,366 --> 01:19:16,089
No, man, it don't work
unless it's hooked up to the juice!

988
01:19:16,286 --> 01:19:22,183
See, you got the juice, you don't
need the hollow inside that box.

989
01:19:22,475 --> 01:19:28,338
The music just runs straight from
the strings, through the wire...

990
01:19:30,468 --> 01:19:35,426
.. And out of your amplifier...

991
01:19:39,854 --> 01:19:42,432
.. Which is what this thing must be.

992
01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:45,089
Sonny said he fixed radios
in the army.

993
01:19:45,234 --> 01:19:48,992
Sonny didn't do nothing
but feed bed bugs in anybody's army.

994
01:19:49,191 --> 01:19:51,160
And some of them caught in his head.

995
01:19:51,281 --> 01:19:54,379
I'm surprised he's even got
the wit to pick cotton.

996
01:19:54,550 --> 01:19:57,614
Judge Gatlin done bought himself
a drooling idiot.

997
01:19:57,783 --> 01:20:00,872
What you gonna amplifyDaddy?

998
01:20:01,042 --> 01:20:03,281
Unless you're gonna sit
over in your chair

999
01:20:03,414 --> 01:20:07,063
and play those littleAside, man.

1000
01:20:07,257 --> 01:20:10,295
Sitting over there,
looking all clean and polite.

1001
01:20:10,463 --> 01:20:12,273
The guitar ain't been up front,

1002
01:20:12,388 --> 01:20:14,632
since those old pissing
moan blue shouters

1003
01:20:14,765 --> 01:20:17,683
sit their blind asses on the corner
hollering for pennies!

1004
01:20:17,846 --> 01:20:19,376
Old-time music. Daddy?

1005
01:20:19,478 --> 01:20:22,356
Sonny didn't do nothing
to get arrested for.

1006
01:20:22,517 --> 01:20:24,486
He was just looking for work.

1007
01:20:24,608 --> 01:20:28,571
They've hung coloured boys
for less than that, darling.

1008
01:20:28,779 --> 01:20:32,817
Least on the work gang they feed
them, keep their strength up.

1009
01:20:33,028 --> 01:20:35,357
But he doesn't belong there.

1010
01:20:35,494 --> 01:20:39,817
You know, Guitar Sam plays him
an electric.

1011
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:43,758
But I don't think it's
this no-hole kind of deal.

1012
01:20:43,956 --> 01:20:47,640
Hope he plugs it into
the wrong socket some night

1013
01:20:47,835 --> 01:20:50,559
and electrocutes
his sorry, no-show ass.

1014
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:54,380
Mace?

1015
01:20:55,808 --> 01:21:03,364
Now, if he showed up here
and our power went out again,

1016
01:21:03,727 --> 01:21:05,256
while he was playing...

1017
01:21:05,358 --> 01:21:07,477
Nah, I fixed it good this time, Ty.

1018
01:21:07,605 --> 01:21:08,895
Eh...

1019
01:21:08,988 --> 01:21:12,426
So he comes out, and he plugs
his axe into the wall...

1020
01:21:12,611 --> 01:21:15,535
He'd come out looking good,
from what I hear!

1021
01:21:15,698 --> 01:21:18,839
All kinds of spangly pants
and jacket!

1022
01:21:19,011 --> 01:21:22,117
Got his name spelt out on the back!

1023
01:21:23,294 --> 01:21:26,133
The clothes, right?!All slick and shiny!

1024
01:21:26,292 --> 01:21:28,336
Flash them gold teeth at them gals!

1025
01:21:28,461 --> 01:21:30,630
Got his sax man behind him.

1026
01:21:30,761 --> 01:21:33,725
Maybe a piano, harmonica and drums.

1027
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:36,488
Hey, you remember that night
at the Esquire Club,

1028
01:21:36,637 --> 01:21:38,698
when the lights went out in Mobile?

1029
01:21:38,824 --> 01:21:40,815
Yeah, and they took off
with the gate.

1030
01:21:40,937 --> 01:21:43,336
Just stole the damn register
right off the counter!

1031
01:21:43,476 --> 01:21:45,840
They didn't hold Reggie Porter
for it, did they?!

1032
01:21:45,979 --> 01:21:48,903
Nah! They knew it was
this place got robbed!

1033
01:21:49,066 --> 01:21:51,954
Did nobody hold it to Reggie Porter?

1034
01:21:52,115 --> 01:21:55,074
And nobody expected
their money to come back.

1035
01:21:55,239 --> 01:21:58,163
No, cos they was too busy
diving for the pot

1036
01:21:58,326 --> 01:22:00,175
and that trump game got interrupted.

1037
01:22:00,291 --> 01:22:04,849
And nobody suspected that it might
have been Reggie Porter hisself!

1038
01:22:05,083 --> 01:22:08,207
Hisself that pulled the lights!

1039
01:22:10,844 --> 01:22:12,168
No.

1040
01:22:12,262 --> 01:22:13,461
No, Ty. No.

1041
01:22:13,549 --> 01:22:14,678
No. No. No.

1042
01:22:14,764 --> 01:22:18,922
China Doll! You mind the place till
we get back. Hey, come on, Mace.

1043
01:22:19,138 --> 01:22:21,228
Where you going, Daddy?!

1044
01:22:21,355 --> 01:22:25,033
I promised the people Guitar Sam,
and they're going to get Guitar Sam!

1045
01:22:25,228 --> 01:22:27,112
Come on, Mace,
let's get out of here!

1046
01:22:27,230 --> 01:22:28,755
We've got work to do.

1047
01:22:34,660 --> 01:22:37,659
Why are you so interested
in this boy?

1048
01:22:37,825 --> 01:22:39,309
Got a job for him.

1049
01:22:41,042 --> 01:22:44,480
You must be doing pretty well
for yourself out there, Tyrone.

1050
01:22:44,665 --> 01:22:46,629
You're hiring new people on.

1051
01:22:46,751 --> 01:22:49,560
Passing well, yeah.

1052
01:22:49,718 --> 01:22:52,636
But this boy... Name is Sonny.

1053
01:22:52,798 --> 01:22:54,767
Uh-huh.

1054
01:22:54,889 --> 01:22:58,088
Well, he's paying off his debt
to society right now.

1055
01:22:58,263 --> 01:23:00,752
If I was to pull him
out of the field...

1056
01:23:00,896 --> 01:23:04,294
Judge Gatlin paid for your day
of prison labour.

1057
01:23:05,526 --> 01:23:08,884
You willing to pay for him
for the duration of his sentence?

1058
01:23:09,065 --> 01:23:11,709
Which might be?As long as I care to make it.

1059
01:23:14,618 --> 01:23:17,477
Well, I was counting on...

1060
01:23:17,637 --> 01:23:20,988
more of a one-time deal.

1061
01:23:21,170 --> 01:23:24,486
If I can rent him out50.

1062
01:23:26,673 --> 01:23:28,237
It's not just the money.

1063
01:23:28,341 --> 01:23:32,619
There's legalistic principles
involved here. Public safety issues.

1064
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:35,369
I'll pay you Sunday morning.

1065
01:23:35,515 --> 01:23:38,873
You going to pay me now,
or you can forget about it.

1066
01:23:40,312 --> 01:23:41,871
I don't have it now.

1067
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:43,379
Hm.

1068
01:23:44,858 --> 01:23:49,416
You think you're too smart for
the rest of us, don't you, Tyrone?

1069
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:52,174
Think you can go it all by yourself.

1070
01:23:54,744 --> 01:23:56,588
You'd rather eat roofing nails

1071
01:23:56,704 --> 01:23:59,623
than come to me for a favour now,
wouldn't you?

1072
01:23:59,786 --> 01:24:02,070
It's not a favour
if I'm gonna pay for it.

1073
01:24:02,205 --> 01:24:04,248
Oh, you're gonna pay all right.

1074
01:24:05,921 --> 01:24:09,240
If you don't hand over that money
to me by Sunday morning,

1075
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:11,504
you've got yourself a new partner.

1076
01:24:17,267 --> 01:24:19,066
Same deal as I got with Toussaint.

1077
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:20,624
What'll that be?

1078
01:24:24,691 --> 01:24:26,330
You'll get the 50.

1079
01:24:27,987 --> 01:24:30,066
And that wife of yours.

1080
01:24:31,156 --> 01:24:33,315
Delilah? Mm-hm.

1081
01:24:34,452 --> 01:24:36,936
Them fried chicken sandwiches.

1082
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:41,917
If I was to come by now and then
and check in on my interests?

1083
01:24:44,253 --> 01:24:47,017
She be happy to fix you
whatever you want.

1084
01:24:47,173 --> 01:24:51,531
Good. Cos my wife's cooking
would gag a maggot.

1085
01:24:51,756 --> 01:24:56,204
Different people got different kindsYeah.

1086
01:24:56,432 --> 01:24:59,071
Well Lurleen ain't discovered
what hers is yet.

1087
01:24:59,222 --> 01:25:00,546
Let's go fetch that boy.

1088
01:25:17,287 --> 01:25:19,566
Is this the one you want? Mm.

1089
01:25:22,626 --> 01:25:26,545
You got any ideas about running
rabbit on me, best get rid of them now.

1090
01:25:26,751 --> 01:25:28,955
Are you paying my way out?Till Monday.

1091
01:25:29,086 --> 01:25:31,455
How come?

1092
01:25:31,594 --> 01:25:34,033
You like dragging that cotton sack?

1093
01:25:34,175 --> 01:25:37,378
No. Then don't ask questions.

1094
01:25:56,662 --> 01:26:00,145
# Why don't you do right

1095
01:26:00,332 --> 01:26:03,731
# Like some other men do... #

1096
01:26:03,914 --> 01:26:05,803
This size, right?

1097
01:26:05,921 --> 01:26:07,925
But it's got to shine.

1098
01:26:08,048 --> 01:26:10,492
And when you need this? Tonight.

1099
01:26:10,635 --> 01:26:14,718
That's a tall order.
It's got to happen.

1100
01:26:14,931 --> 01:26:21,848
You know, I do my best work,
my fastest work,

1101
01:26:22,183 --> 01:26:24,433
when I'm happy.

1102
01:26:24,567 --> 01:26:28,925
Yeah, I suppose you do.

1103
01:26:30,864 --> 01:26:33,263
You gonna make me happy, baby?

1104
01:26:33,403 --> 01:26:35,327
Uh...

1105
01:26:36,954 --> 01:26:39,917
You come down by the club tonight.

1106
01:26:40,082 --> 01:26:44,260
We having a special show.
Tell 'em at the door, you my guest.

1107
01:26:44,477 --> 01:26:48,621
Food ain't the only thing
a woman needs three times a day.

1108
01:26:52,053 --> 01:26:53,578
What's that, baby?

1109
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:59,277
Um, that boy gonna need time, try
this jacket on, see how he feels.

1110
01:26:59,555 --> 01:27:00,880
Later, Nadine.

1111
01:27:20,123 --> 01:27:22,807
You got to do something
to the boy's hair, darling.

1112
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:26,718
They may not know what the real Sam
looked like, but it ain't this.

1113
01:27:26,917 --> 01:27:29,126
I can try.

1114
01:27:29,258 --> 01:27:30,943
What exactly am I supposed to do?

1115
01:27:31,052 --> 01:27:34,210
You're gonna stand up there
with that contraption you got,

1116
01:27:34,383 --> 01:27:36,345
and play Guitar Sam's numbers.

1117
01:27:36,467 --> 01:27:38,359
I can do that with my eyes closed.

1118
01:27:38,477 --> 01:27:41,835
If we can get the audience to
close theirs, we'll be better off.

1119
01:27:42,016 --> 01:27:43,939
Ty! I tracked Mr Trenier down.

1120
01:27:44,982 --> 01:27:47,261
Let's hit it.

1121
01:27:47,396 --> 01:27:49,640
Bye, Daddy.

1122
01:28:06,131 --> 01:28:09,249
You know what you're doing?

1123
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:12,469
I fix Mama's hair all the time.

1124
01:28:12,637 --> 01:28:15,436
But you ain't been
to that school yet.

1125
01:28:15,594 --> 01:28:18,358
You go to school
to learn your guitar?

1126
01:28:20,062 --> 01:28:21,106
No.

1127
01:28:21,187 --> 01:28:23,625
I might pick up
some things at beauty school,

1128
01:28:23,767 --> 01:28:26,208
but mostly it's for my certificate.

1129
01:28:26,350 --> 01:28:28,553
"And that is a ticket to adventure."

1130
01:28:28,685 --> 01:28:30,819
That's what it says in the brochure.

1131
01:28:30,948 --> 01:28:33,472
People looking for beauty
all over the world.

1132
01:28:33,617 --> 01:28:36,655
You ought to watch out for
them wires sticking down.

1133
01:28:36,823 --> 01:28:38,113
That don't look safe.

1134
01:28:38,205 --> 01:28:40,364
Yeah, power's always going out.

1135
01:28:40,494 --> 01:28:42,618
People getting shocks and whatnot.

1136
01:28:42,747 --> 01:28:45,196
Somebody ought to fix it.

1137
01:28:45,338 --> 01:28:49,296
"Career and beauty
is like money in the bank."

1138
01:28:49,503 --> 01:28:51,644
Says that in the brochure too.

1139
01:28:51,773 --> 01:28:53,845
Plus it isn't physically taxing.

1140
01:28:53,972 --> 01:28:57,890
Yeah, can't see no pretty thing
like you behind a plough.

1141
01:29:01,812 --> 01:29:04,931
I had the rheumatic fever
when I was little.

1142
01:29:05,103 --> 01:29:07,267
It left me with a weak heart.

1143
01:29:07,397 --> 01:29:09,686
Oh.

1144
01:29:09,821 --> 01:29:12,220
Mine been acting kind of funny too.

1145
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:14,724
About since I laid eyes on you.

1146
01:29:20,583 --> 01:29:24,301
What's that? Just some old
moonshine they keep around.

1147
01:29:24,498 --> 01:29:26,982
What are you gonna do with it?

1148
01:29:28,758 --> 01:29:32,357
They joke about how this stuff
will straighten your hair right out.

1149
01:29:33,763 --> 01:29:36,601
I'll just make yours relax a little.

1150
01:29:52,282 --> 01:29:54,726
Mr Time Trenier.

1151
01:29:54,868 --> 01:29:57,032
Has a name to be reckoned with.

1152
01:29:57,163 --> 01:30:00,441
The story goes you used
to play with Buddy Bolan.

1153
01:30:00,619 --> 01:30:02,589
I played with them all.

1154
01:30:02,710 --> 01:30:07,268
And King Oliver. One band falls
apart, you find yourself another.

1155
01:30:07,502 --> 01:30:10,944
There's never a shortage of bands
down in New Orleans.

1156
01:30:11,129 --> 01:30:13,613
I didn't know
you were giving lessons.

1157
01:30:13,757 --> 01:30:15,521
It pays the rent, almost.

1158
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:18,884
You interested in a playing job?

1159
01:30:19,018 --> 01:30:22,617
If you can pay, I can play.
You've got to dress sharp.

1160
01:30:24,691 --> 01:30:26,415
It ain't like an all-night thing.

1161
01:30:26,526 --> 01:30:31,484
You just got to start out, and
then there's gonna be an accident.

1162
01:30:31,735 --> 01:30:32,824
An accident?

1163
01:30:32,907 --> 01:30:35,706
Yeah, a sudden loss of power.

1164
01:30:35,864 --> 01:30:37,189
Lights out.

1165
01:30:38,372 --> 01:30:39,972
It's your gig, man.

1166
01:30:40,077 --> 01:30:41,686
8 o'clock.

1167
01:30:41,793 --> 01:30:44,112
This ain't no coloured people's
time.

1168
01:30:44,248 --> 01:30:46,609
And sure ain't New Orleans time.

1169
01:30:46,748 --> 01:30:49,039
I mean, 8 o'clock on the money.

1170
01:30:49,174 --> 01:30:51,533
If you got the green,
I'm on the scene.

1171
01:30:51,672 --> 01:30:53,393
Then that's the deal.

1172
01:30:53,504 --> 01:30:55,156
You know any drummers?

1173
01:30:55,264 --> 01:30:58,823
I bring you one. And nothing fancy.

1174
01:30:59,013 --> 01:31:01,057
Just as long as he keep time.

1175
01:31:01,182 --> 01:31:03,226
Time is my name.

1176
01:31:12,782 --> 01:31:16,880
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.

1177
01:31:17,094 --> 01:31:21,158
Make your mark here, please.

1178
01:31:21,370 --> 01:31:22,734
You owe me 30.

1179
01:31:24,712 --> 01:31:26,596
The book says 28.

1180
01:31:26,714 --> 01:31:31,152
1.50 every 100lb, and I picked...

1181
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:33,589
2 deducted for stones.

1182
01:31:33,721 --> 01:31:36,645
But I've got no stones in the sack.

1183
01:31:36,808 --> 01:31:40,526
We mill the cotton, son.
There's always stones.

1184
01:31:40,723 --> 01:31:43,527
But there weren't none in my sack.

1185
01:31:45,942 --> 01:31:50,020
We take off 2 a week for stones.
That's the way it's always been.

1186
01:31:53,075 --> 01:31:55,199
Ain't that right, Junebug?

1187
01:31:55,327 --> 01:31:58,126
Yes, sir.
Been that way my whole life.

1188
01:31:59,832 --> 01:32:03,390
You gonna take your pay, son,
or you gonna give it up to charity?

1189
01:32:21,229 --> 01:32:23,028
Wouldn't let nobody mess
with my money like that.

1190
01:32:23,142 --> 01:32:24,991
He took the same 2 off yours.

1191
01:32:25,108 --> 01:32:28,827
Yeah, but you could pave a highway
with the rocks I threw in that mess.

1192
01:32:29,024 --> 01:32:31,925
You country negroes
let the crackers run you like dogs.

1193
01:32:32,087 --> 01:32:34,953
If the sheriff wasn't here
I'd snap your neck, boy.

1194
01:32:35,113 --> 01:32:37,041
Don't let me stop you.

1195
01:32:37,161 --> 01:32:42,559
But first, you're gonna sign
that ledger like you're supposed to.

1196
01:32:42,829 --> 01:32:45,793
Don't want nobody crying
they didn't get their due.

1197
01:32:54,805 --> 01:32:57,644
DELILAH HUMS

1198
01:33:18,497 --> 01:33:21,175
How could you do that?I'm gonna put it back.

1199
01:33:21,327 --> 01:33:23,971
You don't go gambling
with my baby's money.

1200
01:33:24,122 --> 01:33:27,371
I ain't got no man playing.

1201
01:33:27,548 --> 01:33:29,747
I don't care what you took it for.

1202
01:33:29,878 --> 01:33:30,928
I save for China Doll

1203
01:33:31,010 --> 01:33:34,048
and you ain't got not business
putting your fingers on it.

1204
01:33:34,216 --> 01:33:35,786
China don't need any school, baby.

1205
01:33:35,890 --> 01:33:38,649
She could walk into any of those
places right now and get a job.

1206
01:33:38,805 --> 01:33:41,608
There's got to be some line
you won't cross, Ty.

1207
01:33:41,766 --> 01:33:43,668
There's got to be something
you won't do.

1208
01:33:43,786 --> 01:33:45,618
The world start throwing me
a break woman,

1209
01:33:45,734 --> 01:33:47,898
maybe I'll catch religion
and walk the straight and narrow

1210
01:33:48,028 --> 01:33:51,425
like those Bible toppers you
set up with. But until that day...

1211
01:33:51,608 --> 01:33:54,452
Reverend Cutlip was right about you.

1212
01:33:57,495 --> 01:33:59,134
Oh, shit.

1213
01:33:59,242 --> 01:34:00,847
Damn!

1214
01:34:34,784 --> 01:34:36,423
Mr Purvis?

1215
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:42,998
People call me Ty or they call me
Pine Top, it's Mr Pine Top to you.

1216
01:34:46,338 --> 01:34:49,377
I just want to tell you how
I appreciate the opportunity.

1217
01:34:49,545 --> 01:34:51,029
Right.

1218
01:34:56,307 --> 01:34:59,286
I know every one
of Guitar Sam's songs.

1219
01:34:59,451 --> 01:35:02,395
I know the chords, I know the words.

1220
01:35:06,942 --> 01:35:09,821
China Doll was saying
how you was famous once.

1221
01:35:11,531 --> 01:35:13,055
I was known,

1222
01:35:13,157 --> 01:35:15,037
but never what you call famous.

1223
01:35:18,121 --> 01:35:20,800
How do you get your start?

1224
01:35:24,253 --> 01:35:25,897
Down in Mobile.

1225
01:35:26,004 --> 01:35:29,962
An old professional.

1226
01:35:30,170 --> 01:35:34,059
The name of Joe Dudlow.

1227
01:35:34,263 --> 01:35:36,662
He'd had a stroke on one side.

1228
01:35:38,017 --> 01:35:40,375
Curled him all up.

1229
01:35:42,062 --> 01:35:43,701
Kept on plugging.

1230
01:35:46,525 --> 01:35:51,963
I used to come out and
play his left hand for him.

1231
01:35:52,235 --> 01:35:53,964
This one night,

1232
01:35:54,075 --> 01:35:56,154
he was going hot and heavy.

1233
01:35:58,079 --> 01:35:59,818
His show's just past,

1234
01:35:59,930 --> 01:36:01,600
right at the piano,

1235
01:36:01,708 --> 01:36:04,587
middle of Black Bottom Stomp.

1236
01:36:06,296 --> 01:36:09,535
They'd propped him up at the bar,

1237
01:36:09,712 --> 01:36:11,756
stuck a drink in his hand...

1238
01:36:13,471 --> 01:36:18,628
Told me to keep pounding
those ivories.

1239
01:36:19,852 --> 01:36:24,810
There was a meanness
hanging over them two johns.

1240
01:36:25,061 --> 01:36:28,022
There was murder in the air.

1241
01:36:28,186 --> 01:36:31,077
Stopped playing for the minute,

1242
01:36:31,239 --> 01:36:34,438
come down on you
like a flock of girls.

1243
01:36:34,613 --> 01:36:37,102
Hey.

1244
01:36:37,246 --> 01:36:39,445
This is you.

1245
01:36:41,291 --> 01:36:44,455
Big band days on the road.

1246
01:36:44,629 --> 01:36:49,267
Reginald Erskine.
I don't believe I've heard of him.

1247
01:36:49,504 --> 01:36:52,347
Big, tall, light skin fella
out in Carolina.

1248
01:36:53,471 --> 01:36:56,229
Said he was part Cherokee.

1249
01:36:57,349 --> 01:36:59,634
Couldn't play nothing,

1250
01:36:59,769 --> 01:37:03,447
but he'd raise a little stink
and he had just long greasy hair

1251
01:37:03,642 --> 01:37:06,526
he'd through around
like Cab Calloway.

1252
01:37:06,687 --> 01:37:08,656
And you were the piano man?

1253
01:37:08,778 --> 01:37:12,781
Piano man, arranger, you name it.

1254
01:37:12,991 --> 01:37:15,790
That must have been something,
travelling the country first class.

1255
01:37:15,947 --> 01:37:20,710
I don't know about first class,
but I seen the country.

1256
01:37:20,952 --> 01:37:22,436
How come you stopped?

1257
01:37:25,796 --> 01:37:29,559
I got tired of carrying
another man's water.

1258
01:37:29,758 --> 01:37:33,636
Didn't want to die in no
coloured hotel some night

1259
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:36,044
in who knows where Arkansas.

1260
01:37:39,893 --> 01:37:42,737
Met Delilah.

1261
01:37:42,897 --> 01:37:44,496
Wanted something of my own.

1262
01:37:48,945 --> 01:37:52,263
You don't have nothing
to worry about, Mr Pine Top.

1263
01:37:52,443 --> 01:37:54,732
I won't let you down tonight.

1264
01:37:54,868 --> 01:37:59,067
No, I... I don't suppose you will.

1265
01:38:24,982 --> 01:38:26,147
# You got to choose

1266
01:38:26,234 --> 01:38:28,913
# You got to choose
between the fire and the Lord

1267
01:38:29,065 --> 01:38:30,034
# You got to choose

1268
01:38:30,113 --> 01:38:33,291
# You got to choose
between the fire and the Lord

1269
01:38:33,465 --> 01:38:36,609
# You got to choose between
the fire and the Lord

1270
01:38:37,996 --> 01:38:40,035
# You're gonna make it all right

1271
01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:54,803
# You got to choose

1272
01:38:54,888 --> 01:38:57,167
# You got to choose between
the world and the Lord

1273
01:38:57,302 --> 01:38:58,272
# You got to choose

1274
01:38:58,351 --> 01:39:04,508
# You got to choose between
the world and the Lord

1275
01:39:06,067 --> 01:39:08,026
# You better jump on board

1276
01:39:21,791 --> 01:39:22,796
# You got to choose

1277
01:39:22,876 --> 01:39:25,595
# You got to choose
between the word and the Lord

1278
01:39:25,749 --> 01:39:26,758
# You got to choose

1279
01:39:26,838 --> 01:39:29,677
# You got to choose
between the word and the Lord

1280
01:39:29,836 --> 01:39:32,640
# You got to choose between
the word and the Lord

1281
01:39:34,346 --> 01:39:37,030
# You better jump on board

1282
01:39:37,182 --> 01:39:41,960
# When that sun no longer shines

1283
01:39:42,203 --> 01:39:46,911
# God will send his final sign

1284
01:39:47,151 --> 01:39:50,635
# Get down sinner
You got to kneel

1285
01:39:50,822 --> 01:39:53,820
# You got to kneel for the saviour
and pray

1286
01:39:54,952 --> 01:39:58,210
# You got to kneel for the saviour
and pray

1287
01:39:58,387 --> 01:40:01,618
# You got to kneel
for the saviour and pray

1288
01:40:01,794 --> 01:40:04,990
There ain't no hiding
from the judgement day

1289
01:40:05,165 --> 01:40:06,806
# There ain't no hiding

1290
01:40:06,913 --> 01:40:08,596
# From the judgement day

1291
01:40:08,705 --> 01:40:12,308
# No, there ain't no hiding

1292
01:40:12,501 --> 01:40:16,069
# From the judgement day. #

1293
01:40:16,259 --> 01:40:18,440
Have a good time.

1294
01:40:18,571 --> 01:40:20,718
Hi there, young lady.

1295
01:40:22,939 --> 01:40:26,137
Good evening, welcome to the
Honeydripper. Have a good time.

1296
01:40:32,073 --> 01:40:34,076
Everybody's getting restless.

1297
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:37,279
How we doing? We're gonna be
full up, but the food...

1298
01:40:39,831 --> 01:40:41,950
Is Delilah coming in?

1299
01:40:44,335 --> 01:40:45,939
What if I've lost her?

1300
01:40:46,045 --> 01:40:49,404
She won't let you down, Ty. This ain't going to work, is it?

1301
01:40:49,586 --> 01:40:53,114
You just got to play it out and see. Guitar Sam!

1302
01:40:53,303 --> 01:40:55,662
See if you can push another round
of drinks while I stall them.

1303
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:57,370
Then you going to bring him out?Sam!

1304
01:40:57,475 --> 01:41:00,473
We coming here to hear
the guitar man play!

1305
01:41:00,639 --> 01:41:02,529
Be on the wires.

1306
01:41:02,647 --> 01:41:06,410
Give them three barsGuitar Sam!

1307
01:41:06,609 --> 01:41:09,728
I got a baseball bat under the
counter but you out here all alone.

1308
01:41:09,900 --> 01:41:11,588
Just get the liquor moving, Mace.

1309
01:41:11,697 --> 01:41:13,976
And keep the money
where you can run with it.

1310
01:41:14,111 --> 01:41:15,720
Guitar Sam!

1311
01:41:15,826 --> 01:41:21,104
The Lord don't want nobody
to sit back and suffer.

1312
01:41:21,369 --> 01:41:23,870
He want you to stand up.

1313
01:41:24,014 --> 01:41:26,487
He want you to rise up.

1314
01:41:26,631 --> 01:41:29,034
He want you to step forward

1315
01:41:29,174 --> 01:41:35,011
and come down to the merciful arms
of his eternal salvation.

1316
01:41:35,300 --> 01:41:40,543
A fire is heating up,
brothers and sisters,

1317
01:41:40,806 --> 01:41:42,975
and judgement day is nigh.

1318
01:41:43,105 --> 01:41:46,908
Anybody out there tonight
want to answer his call?

1319
01:41:47,109 --> 01:41:52,546
Anybody out there tonight, is gonna
step forward and be saved?

1320
01:41:52,818 --> 01:41:55,827
Ain't no time to hesitate.

1321
01:41:55,993 --> 01:41:59,792
Got to come on down
and offer yourself to the Lord.

1322
01:41:59,993 --> 01:42:01,922
Come on. Come on, come on, sister.

1323
01:42:02,042 --> 01:42:05,240
I believe you hear the
Lord's voice talking to you sister.

1324
01:42:05,415 --> 01:42:08,899
That's the Lord's voice
and I believe you hear it.

1325
01:42:09,086 --> 01:42:10,975
I do believe you hear it.

1326
01:42:11,093 --> 01:42:14,891
Come on down.
Bring it on down to his salvation.

1327
01:42:15,091 --> 01:42:17,260
Feel the Lord at your back.

1328
01:42:17,391 --> 01:42:22,229
You got to leave them sinners behind.
Come on down.

1329
01:42:24,064 --> 01:42:26,508
Come on down.

1330
01:42:26,650 --> 01:42:28,774
I see you sister, coming.

1331
01:42:28,903 --> 01:42:31,342
I see the Lord is talking to you.

1332
01:42:31,484 --> 01:42:34,145
I hear the Lord is talking to you.

1333
01:42:34,296 --> 01:42:36,888
I believe you hear him, sister.

1334
01:42:37,037 --> 01:42:41,515
Come on down,
you hear the voice of the Lord?

1335
01:42:41,745 --> 01:42:43,926
You hear the voice of the Lord.

1336
01:42:44,056 --> 01:42:46,168
That voice is trying to tell you

1337
01:42:46,296 --> 01:42:49,134
where you need to be right now,
sister.

1338
01:42:49,293 --> 01:42:52,097
All you've got to do,
all you've got to do

1339
01:42:52,255 --> 01:42:55,076
is move your feet and get there.

1340
01:42:55,235 --> 01:42:58,022
Move your feet and get there.

1341
01:43:02,021 --> 01:43:03,820
You look good.

1342
01:43:03,934 --> 01:43:05,938
Damn.

1343
01:43:07,484 --> 01:43:09,528
He look good, don't he, Daddy? Yeah.

1344
01:43:09,653 --> 01:43:14,771
Honey, I need you to get right
by that front door

1345
01:43:15,029 --> 01:43:17,390
and take over collecting
the cover charge.

1346
01:43:17,528 --> 01:43:19,820
Anything happens,
go wrong or something,

1347
01:43:19,956 --> 01:43:22,675
you just step out and walk away
from the club, you hear?

1348
01:43:22,829 --> 01:43:24,433
What's going to go wrong?

1349
01:43:26,255 --> 01:43:29,533
Guitar Sam here,
gets them soldier boys jumping,

1350
01:43:29,711 --> 01:43:31,281
get a little rough in here.

1351
01:43:31,385 --> 01:43:33,224
Just stay on your toes, that's all.

1352
01:43:33,340 --> 01:43:34,664
OK.

1353
01:43:38,016 --> 01:43:39,495
China Doll?

1354
01:43:41,145 --> 01:43:44,663
You know there ain't a thing in
this world I wouldn't do for you?

1355
01:43:44,851 --> 01:43:47,535
Even if I mess up sometimes.

1356
01:43:47,688 --> 01:43:49,729
You know that, right?

1357
01:43:49,853 --> 01:43:52,156
I know that, Daddy.

1358
01:43:52,292 --> 01:43:54,560
You go on, now.

1359
01:44:00,916 --> 01:44:06,274
Well, you look like something
that would come out of New Orleans.

1360
01:44:06,542 --> 01:44:09,305
I forget to tell you,
I fixed your hook-up.

1361
01:44:09,461 --> 01:44:10,991
My what?

1362
01:44:11,093 --> 01:44:13,452
Your hook-up, where your
electricity comes in. It was...

1363
01:44:13,591 --> 01:44:16,958
Ty, we've got a situation out there.

1364
01:44:17,140 --> 01:44:21,139
You don't think I know that?Got the law in the house.

1365
01:44:30,196 --> 01:44:32,480
Didn't think
we'd be seeing you so soon.

1366
01:44:32,615 --> 01:44:35,654
You got a real nice crowd
here tonight, Tyrone.

1367
01:44:35,822 --> 01:44:37,591
I see them army uniforms.

1368
01:44:37,704 --> 01:44:42,062
We got ourselves
this special attraction. See...

1369
01:44:42,287 --> 01:44:45,376
Chicken. Huh?

1370
01:44:45,546 --> 01:44:48,025
Them ribs outside smell real good,

1371
01:44:48,168 --> 01:44:49,657
but I'm afraid my heart's set

1372
01:44:49,758 --> 01:44:52,276
on some of your wife Delilah's
fried chicken.

1373
01:44:53,428 --> 01:44:54,552
Right.

1374
01:44:54,637 --> 01:44:56,881
She made it last Saturday
at the mayor's,

1375
01:44:57,015 --> 01:45:00,894
but old Clayford Gentry came up
and he ate all the drumsticks.

1376
01:45:02,646 --> 01:45:04,805
I'm partial to dark meat.

1377
01:45:05,983 --> 01:45:09,186
The situation
regarding... sherriff...

1378
01:45:09,361 --> 01:45:11,840
She is in the back there cooking,
isn't she?

1379
01:45:16,118 --> 01:45:20,037
Maybe, if you would come back here
a little bit later.

1380
01:45:20,243 --> 01:45:22,132
Regular or spicy?

1381
01:45:22,250 --> 01:45:25,449
They both take the same time to
fix up. I just got to know which.

1382
01:45:29,215 --> 01:45:32,094
I have to make mine regular,
I'm afraid, ma'am.

1383
01:45:32,255 --> 01:45:33,624
Spicy is just fine,

1384
01:45:33,719 --> 01:45:36,803
but it always comes back
to nip at me later.

1385
01:45:36,973 --> 01:45:40,572
It's important not to bite off
more than you can chew.

1386
01:45:40,764 --> 01:45:43,767
You just make yourself at home.

1387
01:45:45,608 --> 01:45:47,287
Good luck tonight, baby.

1388
01:45:51,363 --> 01:45:53,522
Slap some mayonnaise on it.

1389
01:45:56,744 --> 01:45:58,743
You want to wait over there,
Sherriff?

1390
01:45:58,866 --> 01:46:00,830
Don't want to scare off
the customers.

1391
01:46:03,127 --> 01:46:04,530
Here he comes!

1392
01:46:04,627 --> 01:46:06,306
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1393

So, here is what you all

1398
01:46:46,671 --> 01:46:48,555
Sorry about that, folks.

1399
01:46:48,673 --> 01:46:50,432
Must have got kicked on the train.

1400
01:46:59,059 --> 01:47:01,018
FEEDBACK STOPS

1401
01:47:22,083 --> 01:47:24,242
Thank you, Jesus.

1414
01:49:35,389 --> 01:49:36,908
Got to check that out.

Let's go. Come on!

CHEERING

1423
01:50:41,457 --> 01:50:44,181
Oh, my soul!

1424
01:50:44,335 --> 01:50:46,674
Don't tire yourself out, poppa.

1425
01:50:46,812 --> 01:50:49,116
Me and you got business together.

1426
01:50:49,252 --> 01:50:52,256
I believe we do.

1427
01:50:54,471 --> 01:50:55,716
All right.

1428
01:50:55,806 --> 01:50:57,849
All you men, grab a hold of a woman.

1429
01:50:57,974 --> 01:51:00,293
If you ain't got a woman,
just grab a hold of yourselves.

1430
01:51:00,430 --> 01:51:03,194
We're gonna play this one for you,
slow and tight.

1431
01:51:05,566 --> 01:51:08,744
# They did the boogie real slow

1432
01:51:08,917 --> 01:51:12,061
# With the blue lights way down low

1433
01:51:16,368 --> 01:51:19,587

1438
01:52:06,755 --> 01:52:11,312
# Man, I really got a shock... #

1439
01:52:11,545 --> 01:52:16,068
42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 150.

1440
01:52:17,349 --> 01:52:20,232
And there's another 50 in here.

1441
01:52:20,393 --> 01:52:22,957
Lucky Hardaware don't mind
some change, does he?

1442
01:52:23,104 --> 01:52:26,943
What if Mr Hardaware were to say
let the chumps keep their change?

1443
01:52:27,145 --> 01:52:30,188
He wants the club back,
one way or the other.

1444
01:52:31,655 --> 01:52:33,174
How that be?

1445
01:52:35,409 --> 01:52:39,208
Well, he better take that up
with my business partner.

1446
01:52:43,501 --> 01:52:45,705
The sheriff your business partner?

1447
01:52:45,837 --> 01:52:49,275
Yeah. And he's twice as mean
as he is ugly.

1448
01:52:56,514 --> 01:52:59,433
You must want this club
awful bad, brother.

1449
01:53:03,438 --> 01:53:08,076
Maybe y'all didn't notice,
but that ain't no Guitar Sam.

1450

# At the party

1451
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:14,258
# Oh, I was like a chaperone

1452
01:53:14,423 --> 01:53:17,332
# I couldn't boogie real slow

1453
01:53:17,494 --> 01:53:21,573
# With the blue lights way down low

1454
01:53:25,043 --> 01:53:27,807
# I like to boogie real slow

1455
01:53:27,963 --> 01:53:31,882
# With the blue lights
way down low. #

CHEERING

1457
01:53:43,480 --> 01:53:45,519
Sam!

1458
01:53:48,235 --> 01:53:50,879
You is a liar, boy.

1459
01:53:51,030 --> 01:53:54,068
I know Sammy since he was
drinking his mama's milk.

1460
01:53:54,235 --> 01:53:57,239
Hell, I know his mama,
she's lives up near mine.

1461
01:53:57,406 --> 01:53:58,891
And you ain't him.

1462
01:54:04,584 --> 01:54:09,223
That's Creole Sammy you're talking
about, pops. I'm Delta Guitar Sam.

1463
01:54:09,460 --> 01:54:11,349
As long as we straight on that.

1464
01:54:11,467 --> 01:54:13,866
Get on out of here
and let the man play.

1465
01:54:14,007 --> 01:54:15,171
Yeah.

1466
01:54:19,517 --> 01:54:22,596
I'm gonna play one for you right
now that I come up with today

1467
01:54:22,765 --> 01:54:24,729

# Oh, oh, China Doll

1471
01:54:37,410 --> 01:54:39,894
# Can't get you off of my mind

1472
01:54:40,038 --> 01:54:43,917
# But if you're gonna be my baby,
leave all them others behind

1473
01:54:45,669 --> 01:54:48,153
# Oh, oh, China Doll

1474
01:54:48,297 --> 01:54:51,416

Don't have no fighting,
don't have no killing.

1484
01:56:25,274 --> 01:56:28,951
Don't have none of that
dismal nonsense in my house!

1485
01:56:29,146 --> 01:56:30,791
You understand?!

1486
01:56:32,656 --> 01:56:34,855
What's your name, son?

Dex.

written about you two
killing each other.

1492
01:56:48,338 --> 01:56:53,461
Don't nothing rhyme with Moncrieff
anyhow! We got a problem here?

1493
01:56:53,719 --> 01:56:58,597
Yeah, these two gentlemen seem to have
brought something in for our collection.

1494
01:56:58,845 --> 01:57:00,330
Yeah? You first.

1495
01:57:02,855 --> 01:57:04,373
Now yours.

1496
01:57:06,607 --> 01:57:09,926
Y'all still wanna mess with each
other, you go outside and do it.

1497
01:57:10,106 --> 01:57:14,509
This world is full of people
who got no use for us,

1498
01:57:14,736 --> 01:57:17,105
like to see us in the grave.

1499
01:57:17,244 --> 01:57:19,043

You had me from the start... #

MUSIC CONTINUES IN DISTANCE

1506
01:58:12,594 --> 01:58:15,272
Sound like the music moving on
again, don't it?

1507
01:58:17,139 --> 01:58:18,698
It always do.

1508
01:58:31,112 --> 01:58:33,711
Time to make room
for whoever coming next.

1509
01:59:11,363 --> 01:59:14,522
That boy can play some.

1510
01:59:20,205 --> 01:59:21,365
Leaving?

1511
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:26,439
I ain't needed around here no more.

1512
01:59:26,624 --> 01:59:28,028
Where you headed?

1513
01:59:28,125 --> 01:59:30,613
Oh...

1514
01:59:30,757 --> 01:59:32,476
Down the road.

1515

Tyrone.

1516

Who you talking to out here?

1517
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:06,600
Just myself.

1518
02:01:26,003 --> 02:01:28,926
# It started with a 12-bar
country moan

1519
02:01:29,089 --> 02:01:31,908
# Then the guitar bass
dropped the saxophone

1520
02:01:32,066 --> 02:01:34,850
# Up the Mississippi River
came the song

1521
02:01:35,007 --> 02:01:37,931
# Music keeps rolling, rolling on

1522
02:01:38,094 --> 02:01:40,023
# The music

1523
02:01:40,143 --> 02:01:41,662
# Keeps rolling on

1524
02:01:43,562 --> 02:01:46,481
# Use the fender
To make the notes spark

1525
02:01:46,644 --> 02:01:49,465
# Then the bass guitar
got electrified

1526
02:01:49,624 --> 02:01:52,411
# Blues are rocking
Like a good ole stomp

1527
02:01:52,567 --> 02:01:55,571
# And the music keeps rolling on

1528
02:01:55,738 --> 02:01:57,946
# The music

1529
02:01:58,078 --> 02:01:59,397
# Keeps rolling on

1530
02:02:06,920 --> 02:02:08,719
# Whoo-hoo!

1531
02:02:13,761 --> 02:02:15,041

The music keeps rolling on
