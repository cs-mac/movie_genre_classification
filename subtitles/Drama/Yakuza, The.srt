1
00:00:29,636 --> 00:00:31,482
There was a time when

2
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:36,093
being a man meant being a yakuza.

3
00:01:26,262 --> 00:01:28,436
You shitty bastard.

4
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,635
You monster!

5
00:02:26,335 --> 00:02:27,585
It's me.

6
00:03:01,296 --> 00:03:07,606
YAKUZA APOCALYPSE

7
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,130
I...

8
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,574
lived a life

9
00:03:41,809 --> 00:03:44,022
that resembled lukewarm water.

10
00:03:45,728 --> 00:03:47,295
And then

11
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:49,813
I met him.

12
00:03:53,975 --> 00:03:56,816
I became a yakuza.

13
00:04:01,104 --> 00:04:02,964
The townspeople revere the boss.

14
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,441
He takes care of them.

15
00:04:04,581 --> 00:04:06,007
Morning.

16
00:04:06,217 --> 00:04:09,006
- Good morning.
- Beautiful day, isn't it?

17
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:31,551
What do you want?

18
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:51,737
Brother!

19
00:04:51,807 --> 00:04:53,613
Shut up.

20
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,563
It's not as you think!

21
00:05:23,686 --> 00:05:24,845
But...

22
00:05:25,007 --> 00:05:28,980
even a city like ours is not immune to the recession.

23
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:32,321
Times are merciless for small factories.

24
00:05:52,922 --> 00:05:54,377
Masaru.

25
00:05:56,048 --> 00:05:57,187
Papa.

26
00:06:11,781 --> 00:06:14,094
Take this and kill me.

27
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:26,644
I wish I had never been born.

28
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,167
I will

29
00:06:46,378 --> 00:06:48,903
go with you, my son.

30
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:00,105
Boss!

31
00:07:03,817 --> 00:07:05,118
Boss...

32
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:43,567
Boss did everything

33
00:07:43,887 --> 00:07:46,342
to protect his city.

34
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:52,018
One day, maybe

35
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,994
I will be a man like him.

36
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:04,923
Welcome back.

37
00:08:06,757 --> 00:08:08,212
Come in.

38
00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:10,739
Thank you.

39
00:08:13,211 --> 00:08:15,226
This is Kageyama.

40
00:08:15,636 --> 00:08:17,509
I can't remember

41
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:19,952
having ever seen that young man.

42
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,493
You know.

43
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,698
Sure.

44
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:27,721
Wait here.

45
00:08:27,721 --> 00:08:28,959
Yes.

46
00:08:49,627 --> 00:08:51,264
Hello.

47
00:08:51,715 --> 00:08:53,071
Hello.

48
00:09:02,617 --> 00:09:05,357
Everyone, stretch out your right leg.

49
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:35,443
Bastard!

50
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,713
I'll make mincemeat of you!

51
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:39,857
It's wrong to threaten people!

52
00:09:50,363 --> 00:09:51,459
Sensei.

53
00:09:51,682 --> 00:09:52,734
Yes.

54
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,273
Like this?

55
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,969
Yes, you did well.

56
00:10:00,345 --> 00:10:01,669
Thank you.

57
00:10:21,863 --> 00:10:26,508
If someone stamps on your right foot,

58
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:39,111
offer him the left one too.

59
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:47,206
Good.

60
00:10:47,961 --> 00:10:50,305
Very good.

61
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,884
You become better every day.

62
00:10:53,972 --> 00:10:55,401
Good work.

63
00:10:56,492 --> 00:10:59,017
As a gift, take a cigarette.

64
00:10:59,218 --> 00:11:01,587
I've stopped smoking.

65
00:11:01,917 --> 00:11:03,841
You've stoped smoking?

66
00:11:04,154 --> 00:11:05,442
That's great.

67
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:08,837
Well then, shall we go?

68
00:11:23,506 --> 00:11:26,165
Give your best, guys.

69
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,111
Where did they go?

70
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:47,786
To the land of toys.

71
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:55,095
See?

72
00:12:00,277 --> 00:12:02,084
Still standing?

73
00:12:02,213 --> 00:12:03,701
Sit down.

74
00:12:03,893 --> 00:12:05,949
- After you.
- Just sit down.

75
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:08,171
My chair is over there.

76
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,267
It looks good.

77
00:12:17,469 --> 00:12:19,265
Want a drink?

78
00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:20,506
Yes.

79
00:12:21,047 --> 00:12:22,158
That stuff.

80
00:12:22,231 --> 00:12:23,673
Sure.

81
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:35,944
Drink.

82
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:40,322
Cheers.

83
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,496
Well, perhaps it's a bit early.

84
00:12:50,276 --> 00:12:52,338
Boss, is that okay?

85
00:12:52,477 --> 00:12:54,750
Yeah, sure.

86
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,468
He seems to be in a hurry.

87
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,491
No, I don't mean that.

88
00:13:00,117 --> 00:13:04,423
I think it's time for you to try something better.

89
00:13:04,673 --> 00:13:06,769
It's not good for your health.

90
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:08,628
Just for this one time.

91
00:13:10,905 --> 00:13:13,685
I won't touch civilians.

92
00:13:17,982 --> 00:13:19,507
Can I have another one?

93
00:13:20,654 --> 00:13:21,980
See?

94
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,233
Thank you.

95
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:33,077
Drink it.

96
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,381
Thank you!

97
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,907
How is it?

98
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,200
Are you really okay?

99
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,271
It was delicious.

100
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,360
Goddamn.

101
00:14:13,994 --> 00:14:15,075
Hey.

102
00:14:16,161 --> 00:14:19,768
You half-assed idiot still don't have a tattoo!

103
00:14:22,724 --> 00:14:25,023
Yakuza is about this.

104
00:14:25,623 --> 00:14:27,161
Don't talk nonsense.

105
00:14:28,164 --> 00:14:30,292
It's no nonsense!

106
00:14:33,152 --> 00:14:36,317
Yakuza is about endurance. Endurance.

107
00:14:37,894 --> 00:14:40,547
We tattoo ourselves to prove our endurance.

108
00:14:40,685 --> 00:14:42,702
My skin is sensitive!

109
00:14:42,866 --> 00:14:44,907
You can't imagine how much.

110
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,659
Don't tell me to treat it like a piece of leather please!

111
00:14:48,896 --> 00:14:50,769
Who cares?

112
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:54,156
Rub cream on it, bastard!

113
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,664
I'm sick of your attitude. 

114
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:01,648
I don't need things

115
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:05,268
like cream and tattoos.

116
00:15:10,261 --> 00:15:12,296
The boss is back!

117
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,907
Boss.

118
00:15:28,572 --> 00:15:29,745
What happened?

119
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:34,365
The Karatani gang caught him at the bridge.

120
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,153
They beat him up because of a gambling debt.

121
00:15:39,716 --> 00:15:42,270
You had told them not to touch civilians,

122
00:15:42,411 --> 00:15:44,607
so I had to teach them a lesson.

123
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:47,615
Who will protect you now?

124
00:15:49,913 --> 00:15:51,273
Sensei, you too.

125
00:15:51,387 --> 00:15:53,603
Gambling at your age

126
00:15:53,711 --> 00:15:55,826
will just hurt the people around you.

127
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:59,544
Take it as a lesson and change your life, okay?

128
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:04,041
Yes.

129
00:16:04,484 --> 00:16:05,794
Okay, go.

130
00:16:26,794 --> 00:16:30,162
Well, I'll try to talk with them.

131
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,717
Do you think that's necessary?

132
00:16:35,654 --> 00:16:36,484
Yes.

133
00:17:02,172 --> 00:17:04,312
Well, that's how it is.

134
00:17:17,956 --> 00:17:19,773
Once you're cured,

135
00:17:25,187 --> 00:17:27,568
how about we have dinner.

136
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,196
Just the two of us?

137
00:17:29,325 --> 00:17:30,686
No, no.

138
00:17:30,852 --> 00:17:34,150
With the boss, of course.

139
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:40,144
Say...

140
00:17:41,843 --> 00:17:46,139
If you had one wish for free, what would you wish?

141
00:17:49,129 --> 00:17:52,390
A tattoo, of course.

142
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,397
A tattoo such as the boss has.

143
00:18:02,645 --> 00:18:05,098
And you, what would you wish?

144
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,322
Ask me next time.

145
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:32,668
Well, we'll talk about it when you're out.

146
00:18:37,168 --> 00:18:39,334
Are you okay so far?

147
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,067
See you.

148
00:19:02,101 --> 00:19:03,574
Hello.

149
00:19:13,506 --> 00:19:16,068
What are you doing here?

150
00:19:16,598 --> 00:19:17,311
Sorry.

151
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,560
Why are you not with the boss?

152
00:19:19,815 --> 00:19:22,001
He told me to look after you.

153
00:19:22,183 --> 00:19:23,358
Why?

154
00:19:23,441 --> 00:19:24,731
How should I know?

155
00:19:25,358 --> 00:19:27,711
He wants you to stay in touch with Kyoko-san.

156
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:30,452
She will never get involved with a yakuza.

157
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:33,421
Boss!

158
00:19:44,689 --> 00:19:46,722
See you soon.

159
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:51,370
What's wrong with you?

160
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,197
Boss?

161
00:20:18,011 --> 00:20:19,615
He's coming.

162
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:23,191
He's finally coming.

163
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:42,712
The boss is great, huh? He saved us.

164
00:20:42,712 --> 00:20:46,263
We owe him our life.

165
00:20:46,263 --> 00:20:49,999
Let's work hard until the recession is over.

166
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,312
Masaru-kun, you may have some problems.

167
00:20:52,312 --> 00:20:55,636
But we all have a lot of problems.

168
00:20:55,779 --> 00:20:57,030
Yes.

169
00:20:57,514 --> 00:21:02,104
The shopping area will somehow make it thanks to the boss.

170
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:05,598
He keeps chain-stores and supermarkets out, doesn't he?

171
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:09,665
Well, seems I don't fit into the modern era.

172
00:21:09,843 --> 00:21:11,992
You're not a child of our time, right?

173
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:30,587
You two, get lost!

174
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:33,544
Go!

175
00:21:48,805 --> 00:21:50,574
Don't come back here ever again.

176
00:21:50,772 --> 00:21:52,986
That's what I told you.

177
00:21:54,378 --> 00:21:57,507
This is the last time I ask.

178
00:21:58,105 --> 00:22:01,252
Are you coming back to the syndicate or not?

179
00:22:05,219 --> 00:22:08,817
I am the happiest man in the world.

180
00:22:09,239 --> 00:22:13,056
I broke away from you to live my way.

181
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:15,658
As yakuza.

182
00:22:16,895 --> 00:22:21,710
Then it's best to die.
At one's happiest point.

183
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,452
Excuse me, excuse me.

184
00:22:23,853 --> 00:22:25,677
Is here Akihabara?

185
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,151
Huh?

186
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:30,834
This should be Akihabara.

187
00:22:46,663 --> 00:22:47,516
Boss!

188
00:22:55,531 --> 00:22:57,481
Masaru.

189
00:23:04,828 --> 00:23:06,951
Asshole!

190
00:24:07,454 --> 00:24:08,718
Boss!

191
00:24:09,153 --> 00:24:10,623
Bastard!

192
00:24:35,899 --> 00:24:37,445
Bastard!

193
00:26:25,715 --> 00:26:28,048
He wasn't so tough after all.

194
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:27,863
Boss...

195
00:27:35,091 --> 00:27:38,218
Take my blood

196
00:27:38,569 --> 00:27:41,264
and walk the streets

197
00:27:41,714 --> 00:27:44,023
as a vampire yakuza!

198
00:28:23,949 --> 00:28:25,169
Where's the owner?

199
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:26,658
He's not here.

200
00:28:27,418 --> 00:28:30,483
But there is a knitting class in the basement.

201
00:28:30,891 --> 00:28:31,794
Huh?

202
00:28:34,723 --> 00:28:36,277
What are you doing?

203
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:38,718
Who are you?

204
00:28:38,938 --> 00:28:39,754
It's food.

205
00:28:41,508 --> 00:28:42,893
Food?

206
00:28:43,111 --> 00:28:45,635
They are using this as food for Kamiura.

207
00:28:48,489 --> 00:28:49,782
What's this?

208
00:28:49,882 --> 00:28:56,059
A Sushi tun. 
I guess it's a very Japanese vampire sleeping place.

209
00:29:01,993 --> 00:29:04,507
Boss was a vampire?

210
00:29:05,949 --> 00:29:10,542
We entrusted our life to a vampire.

211
00:29:14,134 --> 00:29:16,879
I guess now everything is settled, right?

212
00:29:17,061 --> 00:29:21,339
It's too early to say that.
I'll be there in a moment.

213
00:29:27,378 --> 00:29:29,025
How's it going?

214
00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:30,158
It's a bit confusing.

215
00:29:30,262 --> 00:29:30,954
I see.

216
00:29:31,077 --> 00:29:32,268
You stink!

217
00:29:33,425 --> 00:29:34,967
Ah, welcome!

218
00:29:37,123 --> 00:29:41,038
Ah, I see your surprised reaction.

219
00:29:41,106 --> 00:29:43,318
It's indeed true.

220
00:29:43,517 --> 00:29:47,367
Yes, I'm in fact a real kappa.

221
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:49,001
Pleased to meet you.

222
00:30:04,084 --> 00:30:08,995
Well, anyway,
we're here to discuss the further development.

223
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:15,402
I'm your senior in the organization.
Show more respect when you speak to me.

224
00:30:18,597 --> 00:30:22,731
Besides, something great has happened.

225
00:30:23,547 --> 00:30:25,276
What do you mean?

226
00:30:33,533 --> 00:30:35,459
He will come.

227
00:30:37,203 --> 00:30:38,574
He?

228
00:30:38,934 --> 00:30:40,503
No way!

229
00:30:41,015 --> 00:30:43,743
Who will... come?

230
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:46,240
To put it clearly,

231
00:30:46,347 --> 00:30:49,251
a modern monster.

232
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:53,371
The world's most formidable terrorist.

233
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,026
Are you sure?

234
00:30:55,611 --> 00:30:58,656
I know Kyoken, so we don't have to...

235
00:30:59,142 --> 00:31:01,676
You are strong too, that's right.

236
00:31:01,761 --> 00:31:04,539
But in his presence

237
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:07,964
you'd be stiff with fear.

238
00:31:08,217 --> 00:31:11,610
What are you talking? The boss is dead.

239
00:31:12,272 --> 00:31:17,666
That's all I'll say.
My mouth is sealed.

240
00:31:18,044 --> 00:31:19,116
But,

241
00:31:19,696 --> 00:31:24,936
if we don't have a plan before that guy appears,

242
00:31:25,906 --> 00:31:29,861
we yakuza will pay dearly.

243
00:31:30,345 --> 00:31:31,535
Which guy?

244
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:39,394
What's this?

245
00:31:41,475 --> 00:31:42,903
I am...

246
00:31:43,377 --> 00:31:44,968
Alive?

247
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:52,491
What happened to me?

248
00:31:55,943 --> 00:31:58,264
I'm hungry.

249
00:31:59,686 --> 00:32:02,399
I'm thirsty.

250
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,126
Why did you run away, you bastard?

251
00:32:28,219 --> 00:32:30,195
Get down.

252
00:32:34,738 --> 00:32:38,838
I'm begging you. 
Forgive him please.

253
00:32:38,884 --> 00:32:42,586
I will teach you a lesson!

254
00:32:47,229 --> 00:32:50,162
Dear! Dear!

255
00:32:56,464 --> 00:32:58,170
Kageyama!

256
00:32:58,847 --> 00:33:00,995
You bastard!

257
00:33:03,969 --> 00:33:05,789
Civilians

258
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:12,458
must not be touched.

259
00:33:13,921 --> 00:33:15,958
That was boss's rule.

260
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:17,624
Wait a moment.

261
00:33:18,609 --> 00:33:24,507
Where have you been to protect the boss? Huh?

262
00:33:27,434 --> 00:33:29,113
Me?

263
00:33:29,434 --> 00:33:31,172
Yes.

264
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:34,769
For that you have to pay.

265
00:33:39,602 --> 00:33:43,006
With your life!

266
00:34:08,336 --> 00:34:10,560
Hot, hot.

267
00:34:10,976 --> 00:34:14,490
Hot. Hot. I'm burning.

268
00:34:40,127 --> 00:34:42,786
Do not touch civilians!

269
00:35:04,192 --> 00:35:05,809
Kageyama?

270
00:35:06,678 --> 00:35:08,171
Are you...

271
00:35:48,902 --> 00:35:50,913
Dear!

272
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:56,252
Civilians must not be touched.

273
00:35:56,555 --> 00:35:59,259
You monster! What have you done?

274
00:36:00,968 --> 00:36:02,740
I'm sorry.

275
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:10,049
What have I done?

276
00:36:12,614 --> 00:36:14,269
You!

277
00:36:15,343 --> 00:36:20,018
Die! Die! Just kill yourself and die!

278
00:36:25,685 --> 00:36:26,872
Yes.

279
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,084
Die!

280
00:36:41,846 --> 00:36:43,679
Nobuko.

281
00:36:45,268 --> 00:36:47,595
There is...

282
00:37:02,949 --> 00:37:07,319
no need to apologize... for Kageyama.

283
00:37:10,551 --> 00:37:12,843
It's great...

284
00:37:15,913 --> 00:37:19,795
I feel so alive.

285
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:24,566
Nobuko.

286
00:37:28,254 --> 00:37:31,680
No! Stop!
Not in such a place.

287
00:37:31,825 --> 00:37:35,811
We just can't do it here.

288
00:37:39,587 --> 00:37:42,019
Honey!

289
00:38:12,645 --> 00:38:15,074
Hasegawa-san, what's wrong?

290
00:38:24,278 --> 00:38:25,771
Nobuko!

291
00:38:28,425 --> 00:38:30,146
Honey!

292
00:38:56,364 --> 00:38:57,543
Everyone,

293
00:38:59,535 --> 00:39:01,995
I'm truly sorry.

294
00:39:08,047 --> 00:39:11,131
I'm happy that I became a yakuza.

295
00:39:14,807 --> 00:39:19,617
I don't regret it.

296
00:39:52,782 --> 00:39:54,588
Wait.

297
00:40:08,198 --> 00:40:09,788
"Good-bye."

298
00:40:11,687 --> 00:40:13,853
No.

299
00:40:15,561 --> 00:40:18,871
"For personal reasons..."
No.

300
00:40:19,031 --> 00:40:20,317
No.

301
00:40:21,524 --> 00:40:24,707
"Due to urgent family matters..."

302
00:40:25,328 --> 00:40:26,473
No!

303
00:40:27,956 --> 00:40:31,724
It's all wrong.
"Despite my feelings..."

304
00:40:33,252 --> 00:40:35,398
What am I talking about feelings?

305
00:40:35,556 --> 00:40:39,945
Which words could express my feelings?

306
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:44,640
First, I have to hold her tightly... and then...

307
00:40:44,694 --> 00:40:46,336
Kageyama-san?

308
00:40:48,986 --> 00:40:51,141
What are you doing here?

309
00:40:52,418 --> 00:40:54,364
Are you okay?

310
00:41:19,764 --> 00:41:22,809
Why are you still bandaged?

311
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:26,390
You're cured, aren't you?

312
00:41:28,256 --> 00:41:30,252
I cried all day.

313
00:41:32,536 --> 00:41:35,228
The boss has been killed.

314
00:41:35,405 --> 00:41:37,316
I can't believe it.

315
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,190
By the way,

316
00:41:54,227 --> 00:41:59,121
last time I asked you what you would wish.

317
00:42:00,358 --> 00:42:04,196
My eyes have seen really terrible things.

318
00:42:06,469 --> 00:42:09,326
I wouldn't mind if I lost my sight.

319
00:42:12,325 --> 00:42:14,742
But that's kind of ungrateful.

320
00:42:15,531 --> 00:42:18,408
After all the boss did for me.

321
00:42:19,082 --> 00:42:21,592
He paid for the surgery.

322
00:42:22,692 --> 00:42:27,137
Still, only for this moment,

323
00:42:27,713 --> 00:42:29,633
I want to see a smile.

324
00:42:30,576 --> 00:42:32,934
I want to see your smile.

325
00:43:16,958 --> 00:43:18,704
Kageyama-san?

326
00:43:30,699 --> 00:43:34,631
No, don't do it. Don't do it.

327
00:43:47,018 --> 00:43:49,193
It hurts.

328
00:44:00,217 --> 00:44:01,589
It was wrong.

329
00:44:01,829 --> 00:44:05,517
It's wrong... I'm hopeless.

330
00:44:46,748 --> 00:44:48,431
A dream?

331
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:54,371
How do you feel?

332
00:45:04,839 --> 00:45:08,617
I had a terrible dream.

333
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:11,221
What dream?

334
00:45:16,471 --> 00:45:22,563
You eat soba noodles
but it turns out you eat frog eggs.

335
00:45:23,489 --> 00:45:29,442
In your mouth they grow into tadpoles.
That kind of dream?

336
00:45:33,061 --> 00:45:35,150
Yes.

337
00:45:35,448 --> 00:45:39,540
I see. You're the real deal.

338
00:45:41,245 --> 00:45:42,923
Blood...

339
00:45:43,112 --> 00:45:48,856
Please limit your intake to 250ml per session.

340
00:45:49,063 --> 00:45:52,095
About the size of a soda can.

341
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:58,261
And, any person you bite to drink blood 

342
00:45:58,416 --> 00:46:00,843
will become a vampire yakuza.

343
00:46:00,895 --> 00:46:03,021
Blood of civilians tastes good.

344
00:46:03,075 --> 00:46:05,456
That's why it can make you addicted.

345
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:09,387
Yakuza blood has a bad taste and is low in nutrients.

346
00:46:09,629 --> 00:46:13,640
You have to drink blood.

347
00:46:14,165 --> 00:46:18,328
But too much of this will lead to disaster.

348
00:46:18,438 --> 00:46:24,668
However, if you only drink yakuza blood,
you will end up malnourished.

349
00:46:25,412 --> 00:46:27,219
That's the reason why

350
00:46:27,978 --> 00:46:31,371
the boss couldn't show his real strength.

351
00:46:34,298 --> 00:46:35,882
The boss,

352
00:46:38,238 --> 00:46:40,505
did he leave any message?

353
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,581
Right. He did.

354
00:46:47,625 --> 00:46:52,482
He told me to give this to you some day.

355
00:47:20,154 --> 00:47:24,634
Ah! Now I understand.

356
00:47:25,949 --> 00:47:27,408
Understand what?

357
00:47:27,562 --> 00:47:29,998
That's quite obvious, isn't it?

358
00:47:32,036 --> 00:47:35,349
No, I don't understand at all.

359
00:47:41,244 --> 00:47:43,365
What does it mean?

360
00:47:46,035 --> 00:47:50,634
It means you don't know anything right now.

361
00:47:51,414 --> 00:47:53,180
When will I know?

362
00:47:53,268 --> 00:47:56,006
It's not something people could tell you!

363
00:47:56,163 --> 00:48:00,124
For now, you're empty like this piece of paper.

364
00:48:00,185 --> 00:48:05,539
You have to find out yourself, with your own body.

365
00:48:05,784 --> 00:48:07,233
Myself?

366
00:48:07,272 --> 00:48:11,017
Right. There is a reason for it.

367
00:48:11,135 --> 00:48:17,476
He chose you!
The boss pumped his blood into you.

368
00:48:17,564 --> 00:48:18,857
His blood is flowing in your veins.

369
00:48:19,068 --> 00:48:21,123
His blood!

370
00:48:21,218 --> 00:48:25,773
Make use of it! 
Use it! Use it!

371
00:48:27,068 --> 00:48:28,808
- Are you asleep?
- Sorry!

372
00:48:28,883 --> 00:48:31,707
- Fools, go and find Kageyama!
- Yes.

373
00:48:31,707 --> 00:48:33,385
Stupid idiots.

374
00:48:39,494 --> 00:48:41,151
Is it you, Tetsu?

375
00:48:45,221 --> 00:48:46,639
Yes.

376
00:49:02,258 --> 00:49:03,634
Say...

377
00:49:04,927 --> 00:49:06,585
Are you

378
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:10,989
hearing a kind of trickling sound?

379
00:49:11,702 --> 00:49:13,045
What?

380
00:49:22,212 --> 00:49:23,532
No, I don't hear anything.

381
00:49:23,576 --> 00:49:26,103
I hear it clearly.

382
00:49:26,675 --> 00:49:28,096
What?

383
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:35,715
Maybe your ears are ringing?

384
00:49:35,767 --> 00:49:37,913
I'm absolutely certain.

385
00:49:45,784 --> 00:49:48,790
You're right.
I hear something.

386
00:50:11,916 --> 00:50:13,427
It's strange.

387
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,733
It's inside your head.

388
00:50:15,955 --> 00:50:17,771
So it is, isn't it?

389
00:50:31,499 --> 00:50:33,020
It's me,

390
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:34,824
Kageyama.

391
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:38,319
What do you want?

392
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,486
Masaru.

393
00:50:42,569 --> 00:50:45,839
Don't you want to take revenge?

394
00:50:46,888 --> 00:50:48,657
I can't.

395
00:50:58,706 --> 00:51:01,017
You can't?

396
00:51:06,762 --> 00:51:11,646
You must be holding terrible feelings inside your heart.

397
00:51:26,544 --> 00:51:30,996
Don't bury them inside you, let them out.

398
00:51:31,846 --> 00:51:36,240
When you let your anger out, you'll feel great.

399
00:51:49,235 --> 00:51:51,578
Close your eyes.

400
00:52:10,801 --> 00:52:12,750
Stand up.

401
00:52:13,801 --> 00:52:15,750
Stand up, Masaru.

402
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:20,732
You're no longer a weakling like before.

403
00:53:08,588 --> 00:53:11,341
Place your bet.

404
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:18,820
- Even. 
- Even.

405
00:53:19,105 --> 00:53:20,386
Odd.

406
00:53:25,326 --> 00:53:27,180
All bets are closed.

407
00:53:27,266 --> 00:53:28,706
What are you doing?

408
00:53:28,757 --> 00:53:29,937
Even.

409
00:53:31,651 --> 00:53:33,452
Five plus Two. Odd.

410
00:53:34,476 --> 00:53:36,340
We're gambling.

411
00:53:39,268 --> 00:53:40,663
Hey!

412
00:53:42,535 --> 00:53:45,918
Don't you know this is our territory, bitch?

413
00:53:47,163 --> 00:53:49,324
Hey, hey, you're still a student.

414
00:53:49,567 --> 00:53:51,582
From which school?

415
00:53:51,678 --> 00:53:53,571
Minato Machi Highschool.

416
00:53:53,617 --> 00:53:56,303
Level 2. Class 3.
I'm here for a little company.

417
00:53:56,342 --> 00:53:58,280
You should be in class now.

418
00:53:58,339 --> 00:54:00,614
But I won't go back there.

419
00:54:01,332 --> 00:54:04,548
And now, get lost!

420
00:54:04,768 --> 00:54:07,670
I am a realtor, you see.

421
00:54:07,833 --> 00:54:11,472
We real estate guys like high school girls like her.

422
00:54:11,613 --> 00:54:14,210
What are you talking about, idiot?

423
00:54:14,316 --> 00:54:16,336
Don't laugh, asshole.

424
00:54:16,421 --> 00:54:18,886
We all belong to the yakuza.

425
00:54:19,491 --> 00:54:22,319
With heart and soul.

426
00:54:26,063 --> 00:54:28,877
Don't set yourself up as if you could become a yakuza.

427
00:54:28,984 --> 00:54:30,497
Then...

428
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,848
how do you become a yakuza?

429
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:34,250
That's true.

430
00:54:34,289 --> 00:54:37,175
You can't take an official exam for it.

431
00:54:37,499 --> 00:54:42,487
Or are you saying the yakuza is an incorporated company?

432
00:54:42,531 --> 00:54:44,665
Here is no room

433
00:54:44,877 --> 00:54:47,712
for thugs like you.

434
00:54:47,779 --> 00:54:50,272
What have you said?

435
00:54:51,133 --> 00:54:53,246
Shall I give you an advice?

436
00:54:53,364 --> 00:54:54,824
If you want to get your neck broken,

437
00:54:55,079 --> 00:54:56,457
just go on like this.

438
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:01,462
You don't obey the boss's rules,

439
00:55:01,525 --> 00:55:04,136
you don't take revenge for him...

440
00:55:05,704 --> 00:55:07,538
What kind of yakuza are you?

441
00:55:07,596 --> 00:55:10,238
Hey, you!

442
00:55:15,841 --> 00:55:17,115
Sister,

443
00:55:17,154 --> 00:55:19,440
let me handle this nuisance.

444
00:55:19,481 --> 00:55:21,114
You are a yakuza, right?

445
00:55:21,201 --> 00:55:23,495
A real yakuza, right?

446
00:55:23,524 --> 00:55:24,262
Who is this woman?

447
00:55:24,542 --> 00:55:27,393
I am a realtor, you see.

448
00:55:27,419 --> 00:55:31,455
We real estate guys like nurses like her.

449
00:55:32,237 --> 00:55:34,385
Are you kidding me?

450
00:55:34,963 --> 00:55:37,113
Do you think this is funny?

451
00:55:37,303 --> 00:55:39,069
Let me introduce myself.

452
00:55:39,122 --> 00:55:43,938
My name is Mikiko.
I'm here to take care of everyone's well-being.

453
00:55:44,482 --> 00:55:48,141
Sister, you'd better go home before you get hurt.

454
00:55:48,967 --> 00:55:51,078
You guys, go home now.

455
00:55:51,821 --> 00:55:53,059
What are you talking?

456
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:54,872
Chief Zenba!

457
00:55:55,513 --> 00:55:59,457
If you absolutely insist on having a fight,

458
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:04,363
this Mikiko will pump a few bullets into you, okay?

459
00:56:07,101 --> 00:56:10,165
Life is a struggle for survival.

460
00:56:10,764 --> 00:56:12,199
Chief.

461
00:56:16,644 --> 00:56:18,745
You understand, don't you?

462
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:30,939
Huh?

463
00:56:32,161 --> 00:56:34,621
Seems somewhere water is dripping.

464
00:56:34,731 --> 00:56:36,008
Huh?

465
00:57:10,175 --> 00:57:11,514
Chief.

466
00:57:12,276 --> 00:57:14,073
Chief! Chief!

467
00:57:14,563 --> 00:57:17,020
Chief?

468
00:57:20,362 --> 00:57:22,090
Take care, jerk!

469
00:57:22,502 --> 00:57:24,479
Hey, wait!

470
00:57:25,103 --> 00:57:27,451
Oi, why are you walking like that?

471
00:57:27,512 --> 00:57:30,267
Can't you walk normally?

472
00:57:37,394 --> 00:57:41,242
What's wrong with all these fake yakuza?
And where is the chief?

473
00:57:41,296 --> 00:57:42,949
Excuse me. Sorry.

474
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:46,420
Wait! One moment, chief!

475
00:57:46,498 --> 00:57:48,808
Mama, mama!

476
00:57:49,618 --> 00:57:51,183
You're a civilian, right?

477
00:57:51,435 --> 00:57:53,979
What are you talking about? Of course I am.

478
00:57:54,365 --> 00:57:57,162
There are strange yakuza at our place.

479
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,964
Do something about it!

480
00:58:05,995 --> 00:58:07,345
Hey!

481
00:58:07,379 --> 00:58:10,098
Here's someone in trouble.
Do something!

482
00:58:10,518 --> 00:58:11,866
Hey!

483
00:58:17,271 --> 00:58:18,822
What?

484
00:58:19,838 --> 00:58:23,890
Do you think we'd work for free?
Get lost!

485
00:58:24,958 --> 00:58:26,523
But you are a public-sector worker.

486
00:58:26,567 --> 00:58:28,733
And you are a public-sector yakuza.

487
00:58:28,773 --> 00:58:32,940
Don't disturb the police when they drink and play.

488
00:58:33,328 --> 00:58:38,875
Listen, I've always paid you.
Do something.

489
00:58:40,965 --> 00:58:43,488
A civilian in trouble.

490
00:58:43,682 --> 00:58:45,922
We have to take care of it.

491
00:58:46,502 --> 00:58:49,096
Chief, are you okay?

492
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:51,754
Let's go.

493
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,571
Now let's try this.

494
00:59:01,753 --> 00:59:03,266
Hey, you!

495
00:59:05,156 --> 00:59:06,960
What are you doing?

496
00:59:07,656 --> 00:59:09,472
I bought this woman.

497
00:59:09,762 --> 00:59:12,353
Doing this to her! Don't you have feelings?

498
00:59:12,631 --> 00:59:15,138
Aren't you that school teacher?

499
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,619
Your name is Sawada, right?

500
00:59:16,662 --> 00:59:18,167
Shut up.

501
00:59:19,196 --> 00:59:20,853
Sensei,

502
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:22,978
you can't behave like this.

503
00:59:23,098 --> 00:59:25,971
Don't you see she's crying?

504
00:59:26,128 --> 00:59:27,638
I'll give you the money back.

505
00:59:27,676 --> 00:59:29,575
Let her go and...

506
00:59:31,641 --> 00:59:33,236
Bastard!

507
00:59:35,073 --> 00:59:37,834
Hey! What are you doing, Sensei? Oi!

508
00:59:38,151 --> 00:59:39,449
What's wrong?

509
00:59:40,262 --> 00:59:42,105
Wonna mess with me?

510
00:59:42,717 --> 00:59:44,732
I'm a yakuza.

511
00:59:46,305 --> 00:59:47,671
I'm ready to fight.

512
00:59:47,708 --> 00:59:49,514
Wait, Sensei! Okay?

513
00:59:49,777 --> 00:59:51,983
Do you want me to end your life?

514
00:59:52,062 --> 00:59:53,313
You only have to tell me.

515
01:00:01,058 --> 01:00:03,491
What do you want?

516
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:29,223
Oi!

517
01:00:31,366 --> 01:00:33,561
You mustn't do that.

518
01:00:46,446 --> 01:00:48,615
Just take no notice of it.

519
01:00:49,445 --> 01:00:51,080
Furthermore,

520
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:53,596
I'm also a yakuza now.

521
01:00:55,031 --> 01:00:57,702
Your protection,

522
01:00:57,795 --> 01:00:59,541
go to Hell with it!

523
01:00:59,578 --> 01:01:01,563
No, no, that's...

524
01:01:06,701 --> 01:01:09,067
What's with you?
Are you going to bite us too?

525
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:10,310
Come on!

526
01:01:10,402 --> 01:01:13,655
Try it, motherfucker.
I will kill you!

527
01:01:14,983 --> 01:01:17,022
Uah. You stink!

528
01:01:17,565 --> 01:01:21,205
They stink.
These guys must taste bad.

529
01:01:21,206 --> 01:01:22,893
Get out of here!

530
01:01:22,926 --> 01:01:24,979
What are you saying?

531
01:01:25,031 --> 01:01:26,478
Chief?

532
01:01:34,663 --> 01:01:36,183
What are you doing?

533
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:37,951
There is someone.

534
01:01:42,898 --> 01:01:44,630
A boy?

535
01:01:47,948 --> 01:01:49,023
Huh?

536
01:01:49,191 --> 01:01:51,569
Isn't it the kid of that dead man?

537
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:54,559
Huh? 
Masaru?

538
01:01:55,225 --> 01:01:57,655
Time to die.

539
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:10,177
Hey!

540
01:02:10,302 --> 01:02:10,842
Quickly!

541
01:02:10,961 --> 01:02:13,447
Hurry up! Step on on the gas!

542
01:02:20,878 --> 01:02:21,498
Stop the car!

543
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:22,858
Stop it!

544
01:02:34,809 --> 01:02:35,993
Kageyama?

545
01:02:36,546 --> 01:02:38,679
Turn the car and drive back!

546
01:03:37,597 --> 01:03:38,913
Wait!

547
01:03:40,143 --> 01:03:41,527
What is it?

548
01:03:43,921 --> 01:03:45,613
Again,

549
01:03:46,026 --> 01:03:50,315
inside my head it's dripping and dripping.

550
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,224
Chief,

551
01:03:53,263 --> 01:03:55,701
don't we have a worse problem?

552
01:03:55,828 --> 01:03:57,394
We need civilians.

553
01:03:57,551 --> 01:04:01,272
Without civilians we're in the deepest trouble.

554
01:04:01,489 --> 01:04:05,272
Well, you could say we live on their blood.

555
01:04:05,778 --> 01:04:06,772
What shall we do now?

556
01:04:06,864 --> 01:04:09,847
They turn into yakuza and suck blood themselves.

557
01:04:09,873 --> 01:04:11,821
We must protect the civilians.

558
01:04:11,962 --> 01:04:13,220
Right?

559
01:04:20,567 --> 01:04:21,938
Chief.

560
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:23,880
What is this?

561
01:04:43,406 --> 01:04:45,009
No way.

562
01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:47,510
Is her brain liquefying?

563
01:04:48,407 --> 01:04:50,728
Kageyama!

564
01:04:54,247 --> 01:04:55,708
Protect the chief!

565
01:04:55,765 --> 01:04:57,817
Bring her inside!

566
01:05:02,622 --> 01:05:05,013
Chief!

567
01:05:19,804 --> 01:05:21,148
Chief.

568
01:05:23,432 --> 01:05:25,676
I'm here to revenge the boss.

569
01:05:37,219 --> 01:05:38,337
Chief.

570
01:05:39,307 --> 01:05:40,433
Chief, get into the car.

571
01:05:40,616 --> 01:05:42,410
You guys, go!

572
01:05:48,564 --> 01:05:50,258
Kageyama!

573
01:05:50,466 --> 01:05:51,715
Relax.

574
01:05:52,466 --> 01:05:53,615
Relax.

575
01:05:53,833 --> 01:05:56,048
Relax, asshole!

576
01:06:03,094 --> 01:06:05,396
Stop wasting our time.

577
01:06:06,466 --> 01:06:08,619
Come back into the organization already.

578
01:06:11,311 --> 01:06:12,844
I'm a yakuza.

579
01:06:12,897 --> 01:06:14,537
Join us,

580
01:06:14,608 --> 01:06:15,523
or die!

581
01:06:15,648 --> 01:06:17,412
Shut up with that nonsense!

582
01:06:17,453 --> 01:06:18,919
What a shame.

583
01:06:19,153 --> 01:06:20,919
Like Kamiura,

584
01:06:21,349 --> 01:06:23,929
you're just a piece of garbage.

585
01:06:25,096 --> 01:06:26,352
Bastard!

586
01:07:44,616 --> 01:07:45,662
Fuck!

587
01:07:57,601 --> 01:08:01,154
No way, bastard!

588
01:08:02,542 --> 01:08:05,722
Jesus Christ, he's waking up.

589
01:08:25,973 --> 01:08:27,829
Dynamite?

590
01:08:41,210 --> 01:08:43,230
Your hot bath is ready.

591
01:08:43,744 --> 01:08:45,831
Your hot bath is ready.

592
01:09:07,997 --> 01:09:11,251
Hey, let's get out of here.

593
01:09:13,665 --> 01:09:14,989
Hey!

594
01:09:20,855 --> 01:09:23,317
Why did you interfere?

595
01:09:24,063 --> 01:09:25,696
I wanted to revenge the boss.

596
01:09:25,893 --> 01:09:28,864
What are you talking?
You were in serious trouble.

597
01:09:28,961 --> 01:09:30,555
You're lucky I came.

598
01:09:30,775 --> 01:09:33,434
You should thank me.

599
01:09:45,525 --> 01:09:46,929
What was that?

600
01:09:52,782 --> 01:09:55,753
I suddenly felt an incredible power in me.

601
01:09:56,645 --> 01:09:58,690
That is not all.

602
01:09:59,255 --> 01:10:02,045
Heal your wounds first.

603
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:05,591
Very soon the full power of the boss will have passed over to you.

604
01:10:05,857 --> 01:10:09,898
Then, you will be in complete control.

605
01:10:24,565 --> 01:10:26,452
How did he...

606
01:10:28,293 --> 01:10:31,204
Take my blood

607
01:10:31,683 --> 01:10:34,788
and walk the streets

608
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:37,324
as a vampire yakuza!

609
01:10:41,945 --> 01:10:44,079
Boss...

610
01:10:52,871 --> 01:10:54,985
It smells of oranges.

611
01:10:55,810 --> 01:10:57,282
A smell of oranges?

612
01:11:00,869 --> 01:11:02,752
Maybe...

613
01:11:04,858 --> 01:11:08,274
Maybe it contains a hidden message.

614
01:11:09,752 --> 01:11:11,574
Heat it.

615
01:11:38,014 --> 01:11:40,439
[ Play the fool ]

616
01:11:41,037 --> 01:11:43,295
Play the fool? 

617
01:11:44,401 --> 01:11:46,850
Ah! Now I understand!

618
01:11:46,850 --> 01:11:47,618
I knew it.

619
01:11:47,681 --> 01:11:49,359
It's something you can do!

620
01:11:49,385 --> 01:11:50,530
You can do it!

621
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:53,821
And once you've done it, you will surely beat them.

622
01:12:05,205 --> 01:12:07,295
You want blood?

623
01:12:09,201 --> 01:12:10,911
Well, yeah...

624
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:16,251
You want to suck my blood?

625
01:12:20,404 --> 01:12:22,032
Well, yeah...

626
01:12:43,964 --> 01:12:46,265
To tell the truth, I'm scared.

627
01:12:50,542 --> 01:12:53,369
Can I do this?

628
01:12:58,470 --> 01:13:00,301
Don't give up.

629
01:13:07,992 --> 01:13:09,823
After all,

630
01:13:09,823 --> 01:13:12,799
you want to become the greatest, right?

631
01:13:13,011 --> 01:13:15,969
A man like the boss.

632
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:32,547
He's coming.

633
01:14:32,763 --> 01:14:34,854
Finally he's coming.

634
01:15:01,546 --> 01:15:04,199
Hey, is here a festival somewhere?

635
01:15:21,110 --> 01:15:21,829
Shit!

636
01:15:21,928 --> 01:15:22,948
That motherfucker...

637
01:15:23,389 --> 01:15:24,982
I'll fucking kill him.

638
01:15:27,843 --> 01:15:30,344
Oi! I didn't come here just to have a look at that.

639
01:15:30,482 --> 01:15:32,931
I can join your organization, can't I?

640
01:15:33,151 --> 01:15:36,583
It's already a bit late for that.

641
01:15:37,042 --> 01:15:39,960
Besides, for a kappa like me,

642
01:15:39,998 --> 01:15:44,166
can you imagine what a pain it is when my plate gets dry?

643
01:15:44,258 --> 01:15:46,482
What does that mean, bastard?

644
01:15:49,528 --> 01:15:52,594
It's about time you understand.

645
01:15:52,677 --> 01:15:55,397
My plate is a little dry.

646
01:15:55,512 --> 01:15:57,829
Damn!

647
01:16:06,710 --> 01:16:07,999
What's that?

648
01:16:08,117 --> 01:16:09,239
This way.

649
01:16:09,337 --> 01:16:11,243
Watch your step.

650
01:16:11,337 --> 01:16:13,843
Careful. Careful!

651
01:16:20,749 --> 01:16:24,773
Long time no see, huh?

652
01:16:29,945 --> 01:16:31,545
Wait a moment.

653
01:16:31,601 --> 01:16:34,529
There's a guy inside of this, right?

654
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:40,577
It's a modern monster. The world's most formidable terrorist.

655
01:16:41,572 --> 01:16:44,779
Here. Look at this.

656
01:16:44,841 --> 01:16:48,329
This is Kamiura's blood.

657
01:16:49,069 --> 01:16:50,354
Actually, I...

658
01:16:51,354 --> 01:16:53,440
killed him before you got here.

659
01:17:01,223 --> 01:17:02,389
I was told to hurry up.

660
01:17:02,943 --> 01:17:05,950
What's that?

661
01:17:06,014 --> 01:17:08,716
This is his paralyzing stare!

662
01:17:09,082 --> 01:17:13,124
The power of these eyes is incredible. 
Can you feel it, you idiots?

663
01:17:13,124 --> 01:17:15,643
These eyes can kill if he wants to.

664
01:17:15,724 --> 01:17:19,187
So great is the power of our Kaeru-kun.

665
01:17:24,032 --> 01:17:27,091
I told them to wait,
but they didn't.

666
01:17:27,723 --> 01:17:30,901
Well, well, won't you let off a little steam?

667
01:17:31,312 --> 01:17:32,523
Come on.

668
01:17:33,598 --> 01:17:35,123
Come on.

669
01:18:22,195 --> 01:18:23,941
Kaeru-kun,

670
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:27,381
you hate yakuza, don't you?

671
01:18:28,422 --> 01:18:34,209
But that trembling guy just happens to be here.

672
01:18:34,477 --> 01:18:37,487
Let him go.

673
01:18:42,407 --> 01:18:45,522
The yakuza blood we had

674
01:18:45,882 --> 01:18:49,666
has all been distributed to other guys.

675
01:18:50,018 --> 01:18:54,527
What shall we do now about Kaeru-kun?

676
01:18:55,471 --> 01:18:57,378
Then he must take it from Kyoken

677
01:18:57,529 --> 01:18:59,444
whom we'll offer Kamiura's.

678
01:19:06,404 --> 01:19:08,237
Kaeru-kun,

679
01:19:08,237 --> 01:19:11,163
you will take it from here.

680
01:19:11,669 --> 01:19:12,990
It's just enough.

681
01:19:43,107 --> 01:19:45,093
Damn!

682
01:19:46,337 --> 01:19:48,637
What the hell does that guy think he is?

683
01:19:48,674 --> 01:19:50,819
So arrogant.

684
01:19:51,356 --> 01:19:53,691
Don't mess with me!

685
01:19:57,716 --> 01:20:00,169
This is just too humiliating.

686
01:20:01,788 --> 01:20:05,448
Don't lick a Japanese yakuza!

687
01:20:30,376 --> 01:20:31,962
This way.

688
01:20:36,713 --> 01:20:40,118
"Breeding Farm"?

689
01:20:49,906 --> 01:20:52,341
Chief?

690
01:21:00,021 --> 01:21:02,085
What are you doing?

691
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:05,535
Don't step on it!

692
01:21:06,289 --> 01:21:07,672
On what?

693
01:21:07,974 --> 01:21:09,866
The field.

694
01:21:10,906 --> 01:21:12,217
Why?

695
01:21:13,239 --> 01:21:15,416
Move your feet!

696
01:21:19,030 --> 01:21:21,282
That's how I grow them.

697
01:21:23,608 --> 01:21:25,591
First,

698
01:21:25,723 --> 01:21:28,851
I sprinkle them with milk.

699
01:21:30,810 --> 01:21:35,857
Just some skim milk, you see?

700
01:21:36,234 --> 01:21:38,525
And then...

701
01:21:39,472 --> 01:21:40,840
Look!

702
01:21:42,547 --> 01:21:45,600
It's sprouting... it's sprouting.

703
01:21:47,133 --> 01:21:49,606
Quickly, quickly...

704
01:21:49,866 --> 01:21:53,527
They are healthy and strong.

705
01:21:53,819 --> 01:21:57,650
We cultivate the civilians we need.

706
01:21:57,703 --> 01:21:59,320
What a harvest!

707
01:21:59,522 --> 01:22:01,992
What large plants!

708
01:22:03,994 --> 01:22:06,460
And then,

709
01:22:06,634 --> 01:22:10,276
we can live on their blood.

710
01:22:12,002 --> 01:22:14,574
Without civilians

711
01:22:15,805 --> 01:22:19,126
yakuza cannot survive.

712
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,627
Do you wonna know what I think?

713
01:22:22,708 --> 01:22:23,881
Yeah.

714
01:22:27,368 --> 01:22:29,803
This here is no longer my business.

715
01:23:00,472 --> 01:23:02,021
Boss.

716
01:23:03,358 --> 01:23:05,040
Look at me now.

717
01:23:09,741 --> 01:23:11,720
Damned.

718
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:16,239
Where did those guys go at a busy time like this?

719
01:23:18,132 --> 01:23:19,454
Chief!

720
01:23:39,896 --> 01:23:42,275
Bastards!

721
01:23:45,728 --> 01:23:49,620
This is a farm where we grow civilians.

722
01:23:52,212 --> 01:23:54,527
You are not needed here!

723
01:23:56,493 --> 01:23:57,965
Die!

724
01:24:36,079 --> 01:24:37,803
Who is this guy?

725
01:24:39,409 --> 01:24:42,349
Hey... Stop!

726
01:24:42,596 --> 01:24:44,274
That's dangerous...

727
01:24:50,370 --> 01:24:52,450
This is bad!

728
01:24:56,438 --> 01:24:58,953
This is really bad!

729
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:33,923
Is it you?

730
01:25:54,391 --> 01:25:56,918
Not so fast.

731
01:25:58,296 --> 01:26:00,040
That kid

732
01:26:00,784 --> 01:26:03,091
has something urgent to do.

733
01:26:17,326 --> 01:26:20,527
Masaru, you can handle it, right?

734
01:26:53,954 --> 01:26:55,440
You...

735
01:26:57,047 --> 01:27:00,346
What do you want from me?

736
01:28:04,132 --> 01:28:06,040
Thanks for waiting.

737
01:28:11,438 --> 01:28:13,418
But I guess it won't bring back his dad.

738
01:29:58,404 --> 01:29:59,510
Angus!

739
01:29:59,670 --> 01:30:00,573
Yes!

740
01:30:35,508 --> 01:30:38,126
- Angus! Hit it! Hit it!
- Yes.

741
01:30:38,166 --> 01:30:40,699
Quickly! Crush him!

742
01:30:57,961 --> 01:31:00,931
Angus, we've got him!

743
01:31:52,027 --> 01:31:54,280
Die, monster!

744
01:32:19,201 --> 01:32:20,943
Oi! Angus!

745
01:32:37,448 --> 01:32:40,955
Oi! Angus. Are you okay?

746
01:33:12,860 --> 01:33:17,433
Didn't I tell you?
You can't beat the yakuza.

747
01:33:19,350 --> 01:33:20,418
Right!

748
01:33:22,184 --> 01:33:27,093
Kageyama! Yakuza are the greatest.
Do you know why?

749
01:33:27,855 --> 01:33:30,625
We don't care about winning or losing.

750
01:33:30,665 --> 01:33:33,053
We just enjoy fighting!

751
01:33:43,583 --> 01:33:46,814
Kageyama, I'll take care of that guy.

752
01:33:48,181 --> 01:33:50,371
Don't worry, I won't bungle it.

753
01:33:51,675 --> 01:33:52,952
See you later.

754
01:33:53,923 --> 01:33:55,674
Okay.

755
01:34:21,542 --> 01:34:23,055
I see.

756
01:34:34,828 --> 01:34:38,469
Angus, go and help Tetsu.

757
01:34:39,664 --> 01:34:41,028
Yes.

758
01:35:26,770 --> 01:35:29,805
Damn! Not good!

759
01:35:29,994 --> 01:35:31,927
You motherfucker.
You don't know fright.

760
01:35:31,977 --> 01:35:33,599
You're all stupid.

761
01:35:33,776 --> 01:35:36,841
If you take away a yakuza's stupidity, nothing is left, you idiot!

762
01:35:39,153 --> 01:35:43,954
I will rip off your head and apologize to the boss with it.

763
01:35:52,870 --> 01:35:55,266
That hurts.
Damn bastard.

764
01:36:43,557 --> 01:36:45,245
Brother!

765
01:36:59,728 --> 01:37:01,445
Brother...

766
01:38:14,121 --> 01:38:15,707
Angus!

767
01:41:20,744 --> 01:41:22,438
What's happening?

768
01:41:22,714 --> 01:41:26,127
What the hell is happening to the world?

769
01:41:59,355 --> 01:42:02,239
The world is coming to an end anyway.

770
01:42:03,693 --> 01:42:05,247
Before this,

771
01:42:05,579 --> 01:42:07,505
I want to make it clear

772
01:42:07,573 --> 01:42:09,737
who the winner is.

773
01:42:11,541 --> 01:42:13,907
Man to man battle.

774
01:42:15,249 --> 01:42:17,412
You are down for it.

775
01:42:17,593 --> 01:42:18,806
Right?

776
01:42:21,212 --> 01:42:23,121
Very good.

777
01:42:24,745 --> 01:42:26,328
Just you know...

778
01:42:27,221 --> 01:42:29,123
I will take your life,

779
01:42:29,780 --> 01:42:32,120
if need be with my own.

780
01:42:35,156 --> 01:42:37,496
It makes my blood boil.

781
01:42:37,496 --> 01:42:38,976
Wait a moment.

782
01:42:43,283 --> 01:42:44,946
Kyoko?

783
01:42:46,518 --> 01:42:49,468
You can't win in this condition.

784
01:42:53,710 --> 01:42:55,938
Watch and see.

785
01:42:57,122 --> 01:42:59,788
I'm going to win.

786
01:43:16,168 --> 01:43:20,373
You know why I'm here, don't you?

787
01:43:24,375 --> 01:43:26,367
Drink my blood.

788
01:43:38,976 --> 01:43:41,545
And save the world.
