1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:15,000

2
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,680
Good morning.

3
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,510
Good morning, Doctor.

4
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,850
Mr. Rane, would you like one last look 
at your face before I proceed?

5
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,270
I never live in the past.

6
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,650
No, thank you.

7
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,070
I have to give you something for the pain.

8
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,820
There will be no pain.

9
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,410
Proceed.

10
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,350
Scalpel.

11
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,880
All right. You know the drill. 
Be very, very careful.

12
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,080
This is Charles Rane we're dealing with.

13
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,790
-Where is he? 
 -Plastic Surgery. Third floor.

14
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,460
He keeps changing his face.

15
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,130
If we blow this, 
 we won't get another chance.

16
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,500
Move out!

17
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,710
What time is it?

18
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,840
What?

19
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,510
I want you to tell me what time it is.

20
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,230
Twelve o'clock.

21
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,070
Get down!

22
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,500
Move it out there!

23
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,810
Stairs! Other way!
Move, move!!

24
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,460
Don't move! Freeze! Don't move!

25
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,880
Charles Rane, FBI.

26
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,100
You're under arrest.

27
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,000
Enjoy the flight.

28
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,810
-There you go. 
 -Thank you.

29
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,180
You're welcome.

30
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,640
Listen up! Shut up! Sit!

31
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:54,160
Do as I say and nobody gets hurt. 
 You have the keys to the flight deck?

32
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:57,160
We're going to move there, nice and slow.

33
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,570
Don't make me use this.

34
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,500
Nice and slow.

35
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,750
There you go.

36
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,750
Real nice.

37
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,800
Real nice.

38
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,600
Turn it off.

39
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,890
May I ask you what you were doing?

40
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,850
I was improvising 
 on your security techniques.

41
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,190
That's cute. That's real cute, Miss...?

42
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,860
Slayton, but my friends call me Marti.

43
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,530
Well. See...

44
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:43,280
...if this had been a real gun, that 
 Angie Dickinson bullshit you just pulled...

45
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,950
...would've got your head blown off.

46
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,450
And endangered the lives 
 of all the other passengers.

47
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,370
I was trying to save lives.

48
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,830
The next time a man holds a gun 
 to your head on a crowded plane...

49
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,540
...you follow instructions.

50
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:59,420
You do exactly what he tells you to do. 
 Do you understand?

51
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,640
This is why I gave up my afternoon?

52
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,970
So a former security specialist 
 can tell me how to obey a hijacker?

53
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,640
First of all, I'm not a "former" anything.

54
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,100
Second of all, I like what I do.

55
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,730
I get the chance to meet people like you.

56
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:17,270
I know we got a lot of information 
 to think about, so class dismissed.

57
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,070
We'll hijack you again next week.

58
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,910
-What the hell are you doing here? 
 -I'm doing fine. How are you doing?

59
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,120
What's wrong with your foot?

60
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,210
I appreciate you throwing some business 
 my way...

61
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,670
...but you have no right to interfere 
 with my class.

62
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,090
Look around. 
 This is an airline training facility.

63
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,920
Ok, this is not the Secret Service. Calm down.

64
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,050
Now you're telling me my job too, huh?

65
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,880
What she did was wrong. Period.

66
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:47,390
Maybe, but there was a time you'd have let her know 
 without blowing your cool.

67
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,180
It just dawned on me. 
 She kind of reminds me of Lisa.

68
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,480
She looks nothing like Lisa.

69
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,020
I didn't say she looked like her, 
 I said she reminded me of her.

70
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,270
-We gotta talk. 
 -I'm not interested in coming back.

71
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,190
-Did I ask you to? 
 -No, you were about to.

72
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,370
But you can't tell me teaching security techniques 
 to bodyguards...

73
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,460
...night watchmen and flight attendants 
 is what you want to do with the rest of your life.

74
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,000
It's a job, Sly. I like it.

75
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,450
Look, Ramsey wants me to hire 
 the best person available...

76
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,250
...to head up the counter-terrorism unit. 
 That person has to be you.

77
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,910
I don't want that responsibility.

78
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,840
Yeah, I don't wanna be so good-looking, 
 but I got to deal with the hand that's dealt me, right?

79
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,210
Look, we both know nobody can do 
the job better than you can.

80
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,470
I knew you'd start this shit again. 
 Look, give me my check.

81
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,720
-You want me to stop? 
 -Yes.

82
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,730
Just say, "Yes, that's all you have to say.
I'll take the job." I'll stop.

83
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,560
Dammit, Sly. Give it a rest, alright?

84
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,220
No, you give it a rest, John.

85
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,890
This isn't about a job, man. This is about you.

86
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,940
Ok, nobody knows better than I do 
 how much Lisa meant to you...

87
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,900
...but you gotta stop blaming yourself.

88
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,650
You gotta get off the sidelines 
 and back into this game!

89
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,160
I set up a lunch tomorrow with Ramsey 
 at 12:00 at The Oxford.

90
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,990
I hope you'll be there.

91
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,500
I really do.

92
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,980
Hey, pretty boy!

93
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,220
Who's that pretty-assed white girl?

94
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,730
What's her name?

95
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,120
Attorney Phillips.

96
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,510
Have you found out 
 where they intend to take me?

97
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,680
Los Angeles. But they won't say when.

98
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,750
It'll happen quickly.

99
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,590
Notify my people. 
 They'll know what to do.

100
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,920
California has a death penalty.

101
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,090
It's a progressive state.

102
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,680
I'll have to visit it sometime.

103
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,100
The Feds' witness can prove 
 you're responsible...

104
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,390
...for two airline bombings in the past year.

105
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,240
I'm responsible for twice that amount.

106
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,530
I'm afraid the most we can hope for 
 is that I claim insanity for you.

107
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:08,950
Given your childhood history, 
 we should be able to make that stick.

108
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,200
Never mention my childhood.

109
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,290
Have I made myself clear?

110
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,790
It is the nature of man to confuse genius 
 with insanity.

111
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,130
Now...

112
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,390
...repeat after me.

113
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,970
Charles Rane...

114
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,640
...is not...

115
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,360
...insane.

116
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,480
"Charles Rane...

117
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,740
"...is not insane."

118
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,280
Again.

119
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,910
"Charles Rane...

120
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,500
"...is not insane."

121
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,330
Continue.

122
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,960
"Charles...

123
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,380
"...Rane is not...

124
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,920
<i>"...insane. "</i>

125
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,850
<i>Put some of this on the fire. Okay?</i>

126
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,020
<i>Kiss.</i>

127
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,440
<i>Fine ass.</i>

128
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,530
<i>Merry Christmas, motherfucker!</i>

129
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,610
<i>Open the register. Give me the money!</i>

130
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,870
<i>Shut up! Shu up! Give it to me now!</i> 
 <i>Open the register! Now!</i>

131
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,580
<i>Freeze! Drop it!</i>

132
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,050
<i>Get the fuck back or I'll blow this bitch's head off</i> 
 <i>right now!</i>

133
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,170
<i>Get back! Get the fuck back! Put the gun down!</i>

134
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,380
<i>Put the fucking gun down!</i>

135
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,050
<i>All right. I'm putting it down.</i>

136
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,140
<i>You just stay cool, all right.</i>

137
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,060
<i>You're gonna be all right, baby.</i> 
 <i>I'm not gonna try and stop you, man</i>

138
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,150
<i>You shouldn't have tried to stop me</i> 
 <i>the first time.</i>

139
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,540
<i>Oh, my God! Lisa! Lisa!</i>

140
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,570
<i>Oh, baby!</i>

141
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,910
<i>It's going to be all right. It's not too bad.</i>

142
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,370
<i>Oh, what have I done?</i>

143
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,790
Hey, what do you know?

144
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,160
Here he is.

145
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,490
-John Cutter, Stuart Ramsey. 
 -Pleasure.

146
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,330
Nice to meet you, John.
 Mr. Delvecchio said you might not be coming.

147
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,580
Well, Mr. Delvecchio was wrong.

148
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,180
Let's have a seat.

149
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:55,810
Mr.Ramsey, do you know how many airlines 
 have been hijacked in the last three years?

150
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,630
-No. 
 -Twenty-seven.

151
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:02,820
Almost every commercial airline in 
 the world has had to cope with terrorism.

152
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,720
All except one.

153
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,480
The Israelis have never been fucked with.

154
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,770
They never let them on the plane.

155
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,110
Do you have any thoughts on this?

156
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:16,610
Unequivocally, without a doubt, 
 John is the best guy I ever worked with.

157
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,120
Well, the annual meeting of our stockholders 
 is next week in Los Angeles.

158
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,450
I'd like to fly out there, a couple days early, 
 have a brief vacation...

159
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,870
...before I introduce you as a...

160
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,130
...our new vice-president.

161
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,380
That is assuming you still want the job.

162
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,550
I'll drink to that.

163
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:50,770
Well look, when you meet this board of directors, 
 you should think of something really...

164
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,730
...impressive to say to start things off.

165
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,150
Maybe I'll ask them to fire you.

166
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,830
Actually, this isn't a good time to start 
 with new plans.

167
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,490
Just be yourself: dignified and charming.

168
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,870
Sorry, sir. You'll have to go back through.

169
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,160
Are you carrying any metal objects?

170
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,420
Ever notice how the real suspicious ones 
 never have any trouble?

171
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,210
That's right. That's how they get on the plane.

172
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,170
Oh, man.

173
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,340
Sorry, I'm gonna have to check you myself.

174
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,850
It's that metal plate in his head. 
 An old war wound.

175
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,430
You can go through with your friend now.

176
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,890
Thank you.

177
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,480
You're welcome.

178
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,440
Real quick. How do you do that?

179
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,190
I mean before you get on the plane, 
 how do you do that?

180
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,530
-It's a black thing you wouldn't understand.
 - I understand black things.

181
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,070
That's what I admire about you.

182
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,660
Even though you were being hit on 
 by an absolutely beautiful woman...

183
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,460
...you are determined to maintain 
 your vow of chastity.

184
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,210
You'd make a hell of a Republican.

185
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,880
It is not necessary for you to walk me 
 al the way to the plane.

186
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,500
It's the least I can do. You know we're brothers.

187
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,090
Have a nice flight.

188
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:02,850
I have no idea why I am so nice to you.

189
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,600
Look, you got me here.

190
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,720
Are you satisfied? Now go.

191
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,100
Come on. Don't give me that sad-ass, 
 puppy dog look.

192
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,650
I'm not giving you one. I'm giving you the grateful, 
 deeply moved, Italian-American...

193
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,490
...religiously-inspired look ok.
 There's a difference.

194
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,400
Why?

195
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,240
Because even though you won't admit it, 
 we both know you made the right decision.

196
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,000
Yeah, I'm only taking this job 
 to make your life miserable.

197
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,630
-Is that right? 
 -Yes.

198
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,160
This is where I get back at you.

199
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,750
Speaking of which...

200
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,500
...I got a surprise for you.

201
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,960
No. No surprises. What is the surprise?

202
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,250
Lips are sealed.

203
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:39,260
-Your lips could be busted. What is it? 
 -Listen to this.

204
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,640
When you get to Los Angeles I want you to call me, 
 because I want to hear all about it.

205
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,550
Hey Sly, do you listening to me?

206
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,190
Have a pleasant trip.

207
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,260
Sly, you don't understand....

208
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,600
Have a nice flight, Mr. Cutter.
Thank you.

209
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,530
FBI. Thank you.

210
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,090
Mr. Forget?

211
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,100
"Forget." It's French.

212
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:16,230
<i>Monsieur</i> Forget, you'll be in seat 5-C. 
 That's the aisle seat.

213
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,980
On the left. Thank you.

214
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,530
Norman, it is not polite to stare.

215
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,260
May I take your coat, sir? Thank you.

216
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:00,490
Any truth to the rumor that men in Los Angeles
 actually talk without cue cards?

217
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:04,150
They talk a lot, but whether or not 
 they say anything is another matter.

218
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:07,240
- I take it this is your first trip to Los Angeles? 
 -It is.

219
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,610
I'm Sabrina Ritchie by the way. How do you do?

220
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,880
Marti Slayton. Sabrina, 
 what a beautiful name.

221
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,960
It is a thing most wondrous 
 to be flattered by one of your peers.

222
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,000
I love the accent, too.

223
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,410
Between us, I've been trying to lose it 
 for years.

224
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,750
It makes me sound cold and heartless.

225
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,840
Actually now that you mention it....

226
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,010
Always trust your first impression.

227
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,880
I have a feeling this'll be 
 a very interesting flight.

228
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,640
I certainly hope so.

229
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,640
Hey, you taken the head count yet?

230
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,270
My fingers are beginning to point 
 as we speak.

231
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,350
Champagne, madam?

232
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,420
Behave yourself. You won't get any toys 
 in prison.

233
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:14,340
I never had any toys. My father believed 
 they would warp my sense of values.

234
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,510
Is your father still alive?

235
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,850
Died...

236
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,520
...violently.

237
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:25,520
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight....

238
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,990
54, 55, 56, 57....

239
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,540
58, 59....

240
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,340
-Can I get you anything? 
 -Nothing right now, thanks.

241
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,100
Well. Looks like I just found my next ex-wife.

242
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,690
Make sure all carry-on items are safely secured 
 beneath your seats...

243
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,620
...or properly stored 
 in an overhead compartment.

244
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:19,080
I'm Marti. If anything I can do 
 to make your trip much more comfortable...

245
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,130
...please feel free to ask for my assistance.

246
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,340
Who needs assistance this early?

247
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,710
John Cutter.

248
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,220
He's a security specialist for the airlines.

249
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,630
Security?

250
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,100
I feel safe already.

251
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,870
Menu, sir?

252
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,550
Menu, sir?

253
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,510
Pardon me, Stewardess?

254
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:58,480
Is that man with the handcuffs dangerous?

255
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,310
There's nothing to worry about.

256
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:03,930
Right now, he's as safe 
 as this handsome little boy.

257
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,850
-What's your name? 
 -Norman.

258
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,060
If he tries to do something bad, 
 I'll shoot him.

259
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,910
What if he shoots back?

260
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:15,490
I also have a secret decoder ring 
 that protects me from bullets and spiders...

261
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,150
...but I left it at home.

262
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,200
Don't worry, I've got mine 
 and I'll save all of us.

263
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,950
Give me a smile, I might get you a soda. 
 If that's all right with your mom.

264
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,590
-Sure. 
 -Orange?

265
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,290
Hey, you got it.

266
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,000
Thank you.

267
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,560
Excuse me, Stewardess, 
 I've had the light on for a while now.

268
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:42,180
Flight attendant. If you go back to your seat, 
 I'll bring you your peanuts.

269
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,350
Actually, all I want is an aspirin.

270
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,430
Here you go.

271
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,690
Hey, look...

272
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,360
...maybe I was a little hard on you in class the
 other day but that was for your own good.

273
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,610
Is this the way you apologize?

274
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,030
This is gonna be a long flight.

275
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,690
You've got that right.

276
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,860
Excuse me. Excuse me.

277
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:07,620
Maybe you can just do me a favor?

278
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,040
This ought to be good.

279
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,800
I'm not all that comfortable on planes you know.

280
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,420
There are extra pillows 
 in the overhead compartment.

281
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,460
Just when anything moves faster than 
 I can walk, I'd just rather be behind the wheel.

282
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,130
Who'd have guessed you're a control freak?

283
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:25,100
-You won't make this easy, aren't you? 
 -How can I make your trip more pleasurable,
   Mr.Cutter?

284
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,100
I just want you to check on me 
 from time to time. That's it.

285
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,230
Take your seat and I'll see what I can do.

286
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,150
Champagne with your dinners, gentlemen?

287
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,900
Not on duty, but I'll have some 
 tomato juice if you have it and the..
 I'll have the chicken.

288
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,990
How appropriate.

289
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,910
I'll have the steak.

290
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,010
Keep the champagne on ice. 
We'll celebrate later.

291
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:03,340
Sir, this is Mrs. Edwards. 
She's a frequent air traveler.

292
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:08,680
When I told her about you, she volunteered 
she'd help you feel more comfortable.

293
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:11,180
It's a real honor to meet you.

294
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:15,520
I take this flight at least once a month. 
I have grandchildren in Van Nuys.

295
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,110
That's just outside of Los Angeles.

296
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:21,440
Well, maybe not just outside, but hell, 
 Los Angeles is so spread out...

297
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:26,010
...who's to know where it begins and ends, 
 what's inside and outside, don't you agree.

298
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:30,530
Wait till I tell everyone 
I sat next to you on the plane.

299
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,790
I watch your show all the time.

300
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,910
-My show? 
 Never miss it.

301
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:42,420
And I just love it when you do those jokes 
 about, "Things that make you go 'hmmm."'

302
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,530
-Robert. 
 -<i>I need a special service in first class.
        in five minutes</i>

303
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:55,480
I'll send it right up.

304
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,750
I just loved it when you told off that Madonna.

305
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:15,840
Who is she to tell you how 
 to wear your hair?

306
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,590
Excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom.

307
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:22,170
I'll probably be in there a long time.

308
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,170
Oh, I'm that way, too.

309
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,430
I don't need this.

310
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,430
Oh man, I don't need this at all.

311
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,020
Do you know the time?

312
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,950
Why? You got someplace you got to go?

313
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,780
How do you like your sirloin, sir?

314
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,240
Bloody.

315
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,300
Everybody, sit down! 
 Be quiet and you won't get hurt!

316
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,560
Who's in charge?

317
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:21,520
I am.

318
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,820
Once again. Who's in charge?

319
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,150
You are.

320
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,360
Excellent.

321
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:30,710
Quiet! Quiet! Sit your ass down! 
 Sit down!

322
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,040
What the hell is that?

323
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,670
Sit down, shut up or be killed! 
 Your choice.

324
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,210
Ladies and gentlemen...

325
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:44,790
<i>...I'm afraid your in-flight</i> 
 <i>entertainment program has been canceled.</i>

326
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,590
<i>The weapons being carried</i> 
 <i>by my staff are real.</i>

327
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,270
So is their desire to use them...

328
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,590
<i>...if provoked.</i>

329
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,550
I'm prepared to do whatever is necessary 
 in order to achieve my goal.

330
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,680
<i>If you do as instructed,</i> 
 <i>you will not be harmed.</i>

331
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:00,650
<i>If you disobey or interfere</i> 
 <i>with their activities...</i>

332
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,560
...you will be shot.

333
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,650
Oh, man.

334
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,130
All right, all right.

335
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,630
This is your idea of a surprise?

336
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:29,260
Very funny, Sly. You better be there.

337
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,460
No, no, no. This can't be happening. 
 Not now.

338
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:07,250
First this Arsenio shit, then this.

339
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,020
Come on, come on.

340
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,720
Hello, hello. I got an emergency. 
 My name is John Cutter.

341
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,060
Yes, I need Sly Delvecchio.

342
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,770
I don't know how to spell his name. 
 D-E-L-vecchio.

343
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,200
-Gary's compiled those numbers and-- 
 -There's a call for you on 24.

344
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,400
Excuse me.

345
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,340
-Who is it? 
 -John Cutter.

346
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:40,620
Oh. Great.

347
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,160
Shit.

348
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,290
Cutter?

349
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,880
You! Back to your seat.

350
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,760
Please don't shoot me! I don't want to die!

351
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,970
I said, back to your seat!

352
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,050
They've taken over the plane!

353
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,790
Get everybody up here 
 for an emergency meeting, right now.
 Now!

354
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:05,810
They've taken over the plane!

355
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,660
How many? How many?

356
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,330
Let's say hello to your friends.

357
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,010
All right, freeze!

358
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,960
Drop the fucking gun, or your friend dies.

359
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:33,510
I have no friends.

360
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:36,760
His name's John Cutter. 
 He's airline security.

361
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:40,930
Mr. Cutter, I'm sure your superiors would not like you 
 to do anything rash...

362
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:44,430
...and risk the lives 
 of all these wonderful people.

363
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,180
Stand up! Move!

364
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:56,780
Airline personnel assume a certain risk. 
 It's part of the job.

365
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,700
But these passengers...

366
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,280
...they're so innocent.

367
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:01,780
What do you want?

368
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:07,010
I have what I want. I have control 
 of the plane and everything on it.

369
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,670
Must I prove that to you?

370
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:12,500
Sir...

371
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:15,380
...tell Mr. Cutter your name.

372
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,590
Douglas.

373
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:19,680
Cutter, meet Douglas.

374
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,050
Let him go.

375
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,760
Do you have any children, Douglas?

376
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,610
A daughter.

377
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,230
A family man.

378
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,900
He has a daughter who loves him.

379
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:34,360
And she, until your interference, 
 had a father.

380
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,630
Drop the fucking gun.

381
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,670
I loathe incompetence.

382
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,630
Elevator!

383
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,440
Who are you? What're you doing?

384
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,250
There's always someone here.

385
00:33:20,315 --> 00:33:23,950
I just get paid to send food upstairs, all right?
 Give me a break.

386
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:28,120
All right. Look, we got a hijack situation 
 upstairs, okay?

387
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,830
I need your help. Anything you can do.

388
00:33:32,665 --> 00:33:36,800
Look, I'm not risking my life. 
 You guys wanna fight terrorists you on your own.

389
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,400
Give me a knife or a screwdriver or something, ok?

390
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:48,140
I think we should do exactly 
 what Mr. Rane wants.

391
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,740
Come on!

392
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,920
You got to go.

393
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:27,220
See if you can find something 
 to tie him up with.

394
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,890
Notify the Feds and alert Radar. 
 I don't want the plane out of our sight!

395
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,650
Mary, let me know the minute 
 you made contact with the pilot.

396
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:37,100
Notify ATC. Bring to speed about our situation.

397
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:42,010
I want a complete list everyone on that plane. 
 I want it five minutes ago! Now get to work!

398
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:06,220
-So what's the plan? 
 -Make it to the avionics compartment.

399
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,470
Once there I can override the controls 
 and bring the plane down.

400
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,720
What? This is a jumbo jet!

401
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:14,560
Yeah, I know, but we don't have any choice.

402
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:21,440
Look, correct me if I'm wrong, 
 but wasn't it you who said...

403
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:23,570
...to do exactly as the terrorists tell you to do?

404
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,120
He's not just a terrorist.

405
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,530
-How you gonna bring the plane down? 
 -I'm going to empty the fuel.

406
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,660
Are you out of your mind? 
 We could all crash!

407
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,790
-Exactly. 
 -No! I won't let you do this!

408
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:37,290
It's too dangerous! You're certifiable!

409
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:39,670
Damn it, Lisa! I don't have time 
 for this shit!

410
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:42,960
Now look, that man is one of the most dangerous 
 terrorists in the world.

411
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,460
He has killed two people.

412
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:49,250
He will kill everybody else on this 
 fucking plane if I don't figure out a way to
  bring him down.

413
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,600
Look, I need your help.

414
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,470
Please.

415
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:57,730
Tell me you're good at this.

416
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,780
I'm the best.

417
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,020
Then do it.

418
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,830
Charles Rane, the sophisticated 
 British aristocrat...

419
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:19,210
...known internationally 
 as "The Rane of Terror."

420
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:21,630
He's linked to several bombings 
 in London and Northern Ireland...

421
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:25,050
...but because of his close ties 
 to the Middle East, he's been untouchable.

422
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:28,840
All right. Judging from the fact he killed his father, 
 he was a sick kid, too.

423
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,590
What his old man did to him...

424
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,260
...didn't exactly qualify him 
 for "father of the year" honors.

425
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:37,520
You let the Feds put a god damn terrorist 
 on one of my planes?

426
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,700
-They didn't notify me. Here's his file. 
 -They can do that?

427
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:43,870
The FBI shows up at the last minute, 
 takes what seats they need....

428
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,070
They don't have to tell us anything. 
 They're the FBI!

429
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:50,540
Jesus Christ. You'd think they'd put 
 an airline hijacker on a bus or a train.

430
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:53,030
Why were they taking him to Los Angeles?

431
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,870
He was supposed to stand trial 
 for the Trans Pacific bombing last year.

432
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,950
Guess he had different plans.

433
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:01,000
He will have to change them again.

434
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,000
Why is that?

435
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,720
Cutter is on that plane.

436
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,770
What's the problem?

437
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:29,360
We're losing fuel. One way or another, 
 we're going down.

438
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,540
Then you'd better make preparations 
 to land.

439
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:36,410
Why are we going back there?

440
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:39,290
-Because it's easier to jump off from the rear. 
 -What?

441
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:42,330
It's easier to jump off the plane 
 from the rear.
 -Shit

442
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:51,630
The plane's losing altitude. 
 I think they're preparing to land.

443
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,760
-Where is it? 
 -Outside Lake Lucille, Louisiana.

444
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:59,150
There's a small airfield there may not be large enough, 
 but it may be their only choice.

445
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:03,060
-How fast can we get a chopper out there? 
 -A chopper? Why?

446
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,820
I want you there as quickly as possible.

447
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,730
You mean on a helicopter?

448
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:10,070
I don't want the FBI or some country local 
 talking to the press...

449
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:12,110
...about what's affecting this airline.

450
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,380
Get out there and keep me informed.
 -Right.

451
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:29,460
<i>Atlantic International Flight 163.</i> 
 <i>We're declaring an emergency.</i>

452
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,960
Request immediate authorization to land, over.

453
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:36,190
Negative, 163. We're not a commercial 
 airport. Suggest you re-route.

454
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,140
Suggestion refused.

455
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:42,390
Repeat, 163. We're not equipped 
 to handle an aircraft your size.

456
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,020
-It's too dangerous-- 
 -<i>Shut up and listen.</i>

457
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:49,110
It is too dangerous for you. 
 See that the runway is cleared.

458
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:53,490
Call Atlantic International. 
 See what the hell is going on.

459
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:55,860
Call the hospital, too, just in case.

460
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,020
Who's Lisa?

461
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,390
What?

462
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,680
Lisa. You called me Lisa 
 in the avionics compartment.

463
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,650
She was my wife.

464
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,110
"Was?"

465
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:33,900
She was with me when I tried 
 to stop a robbery.

466
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,280
I lived.

467
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,130
I'm sorry.

468
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,170
Plan not working out...

469
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,090
<i>...the way you wanted, asshole?</i>

470
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:59,140
Don't flatter yourself. 
 You prevented nothing, Cutter.

471
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:02,140
Although it seems 
 I may have underestimated you.

472
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,600
<i>Dumping the fuel was quite ingenious.</i>

473
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,520
<i>At least Mr. Douglas's body</i> 
 <i>won't have so far to fall then.</i>

474
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,820
Maybe Vincent could hitch a ride with him 
 on his way down.

475
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,190
You know, Charlie, 
 I'm a little surprised at you.

476
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,070
Didn't your father teach you never 
 to send a boy to do a man's job?

477
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:21,460
Speaking of boys...

478
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:25,620
...our stewardess friend must be feeling 
 particularly unsatisfied.

479
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,160
Charlie, you ever play roulette?

480
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,580
On occasion.

481
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,830
<i>Let me give you a word of advice:</i>

482
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,810
Always bet on black.

483
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,470
<i>Mr. Delvecchio, are you okay?</i>

484
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,970
Yeah. Could you please close the door?

485
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,810
The door is closed, sir.

486
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:50,810
Do you want us to fly higher? 
 It might be a little smoother up there.

487
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,580
This is fine.

488
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,480
This is fine.

489
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,510
You better buckle up. 
 The landing's gonna be rough.

490
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,820
Let me give you a hand.

491
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,750
Biggest damn Cessna I ever saw!

492
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,800
Get somebody out to the runway. 
 I'll be in the tower.

493
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,040
Patrick, just do something.

494
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,390
<i>Please fasten your seat belts.</i>

495
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:04,760
<i>Brace yourselves for a short-field landing.</i>

496
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:08,850
<i>Flight attendants, take your positions</i> 
 <i>for an emergency landing.</i>

497
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,760
All Right, Listen up, The tower's going to 
 need as much assistance as they can get.

498
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:53,310
You communicate with the airline staff, I 
 will coordinate rescue activities on the ground.

499
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:55,310
Right. How do we get down there?

500
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,070
We step out. Gravity'll do the rest.

501
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:03,990
As soon as it stops, we jump.

502
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:34,780
<i>Mr. Delvecchio,</i> 
 <i>I've got Mr. Ramsey on the line.</i>

503
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:39,320
Well, I guess we can't tell him I stepped out, 
 now, can we?

504
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:41,770
Put him through. Put him through.

505
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,030
<i>I just had an idea about how to use Cutter.</i>

506
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,160
"Use?"

507
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,830
If this works out you're instructed to tell the press...

508
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:54,910
...we had a security agent on the plane 
 as part of our anti-terrorist plan.

509
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,010
If it doesn't work out, 
 don't tell them anything about Cutter.

510
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,080
I'll handle that. You understand?

511
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:02,140
<i>Do you understand?</i>

512
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,050
Yes, sir.

513
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:05,880
Yes, sir.

514
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:16,350
I had such wonderful plans for us.

515
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,730
If she disobeys, kill her.

516
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,190
Let me go!

517
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,240
On the ground! Face down! Do it, now!

518
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:34,920
I'm security for the airlines.

519
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,590
Yeah, and I'm governor of Louisiana! 
 Get your ass on the ground. Do it!

520
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:41,920
I'm already on the ground, asshole.

521
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,730
Look. You're making a mistake.

522
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,030
My name is John Cutter. I'm security for the airline. 
 The plane's been hijacked.

523
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:00,990
-Get the door. 
 -Damn it!

524
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:05,200
The people on the plane are hostages. 
 There are hostages on the plane!

525
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:10,710
This is Chief Leonard Biggs, 
 Lake Lucille Police Department.

526
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:13,070
Tell me what you want, 
 I'll tell you what I can deliver.

527
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,240
<i>I want this plane fully fueled.</i>

528
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:19,250
If I do not see a fuel truck in position and
 functioning in the next five minutes...

529
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:22,210
...you'll be responsible 
 for a great many deaths.

530
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,430
I'm not fully authorized 
 to grant any demands at this time.

531
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:30,130
I suggest you look out your window toward the plane, 
 just in front of the landing gear.

532
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,980
I've just executed five passengers. 
 I'll execute five more every three minutes...

533
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:46,570
...until you find me someone who is 
 authorized to meet my demands.

534
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:49,530
Look, I want to help...

535
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,750
...but how do I know you won't kill 
 the rest of the passengers once I get 
 you what you want?

536
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:55,450
Get the truck near the plane.

537
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:59,540
As soon as the fuel begins to flow, 
 I'll release half of the passengers.

538
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:03,670
You will be responsible 
 for saving a hundred lives all by yourself.

539
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,600
Look, I'll make some calls.

540
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:09,360
While you're on the phone, 
 I'll be killing another group of passengers.

541
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:10,810
Let me know when I should stop.

542
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,550
Now, wait, wait!

543
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:15,470
<i>Do we have an agreement?</i>

544
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:19,730
Fuel is on its way.

545
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:22,810
Check and mate.

546
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,780
Shouldn't we wait for the FBI?

547
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:28,780
Hell, no. I'm in charge until they get here.

548
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:32,080
You heard that man, didn't it? I just saved a hundred lives.

549
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,240
Let them damn federal boys see 
 if they can do better than that.

550
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:44,040
-Mr. Ramsey? 
 -Yeah?

551
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:48,720
Just got this on Rane. 
 You're not going to like it.
 -No.

552
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:51,710
Two years ago, 
 Interpol thought they had him.

553
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:55,260
Remember the bombings in London, 
 the three train stations?

554
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,640
Rane did it. He killed over 60 people.

555
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:02,020
Just to create a distraction.

556
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,680
"Distraction?"

557
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:07,440
This guy's got a habit of blowing things up 
 just to cover his escape.

558
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,110
We've got over 200 passengers 
 on that plane.

559
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,940
What do you think he wants?

560
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:14,320
Obvious, isn't it? 
 The guy is facing the chair.

561
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,120
He'll do whatever it takes to escape.

562
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,700
I wouldn't be surprised if the
 son of a bitch blew up the plane...

563
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,410
...and then just disappeared in the flames.

564
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:43,730
Shut up! Would you get him? He's strong.

565
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:45,980
-There's four of them on the plane. 
 -Shut up!

566
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:48,740
We caught him by the plane. 
 He tried to attack us.

567
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:51,610
If I had tried to attack, 
 I wouldn't be the one bleeding.

568
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:54,340
Do you mind telling me what were you
 doing out on that airfield?

569
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:58,240
My name is John Cutter. I'm head 
 of security for Atlantic International.

570
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,490
I was a passenger on the plane 
 before it was hijacked.

571
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:03,340
Head of security. Ain't that a pickle?

572
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:06,370
You won't mind me saying Mr. Cutter, 
 you ain't done too good a job.

573
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:08,120
What is that fuel tank doing out there?

574
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:10,500
I'm negotiating the release 
 of a hundred passengers.

575
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:12,300
No! You can't trust him!

576
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:16,380
The passengers are more valuable to him on the plane. 
 There's no way he going to let them off.

577
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:17,630
He needs fuel.

578
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,190
He wouldn't trade the hostages!

579
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:22,110
Don't you worry your ass 
 about what he needs!

580
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:24,110
Chief, he wants to talk to you.

581
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,480
This is Chief Biggs. 
 The fuel is on its way like I promised.

582
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:33,330
<i>I, in turn, shall fulfill my end of the bargain.</i>

583
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:37,320
Chief, one of my men betrayed me 
 and escaped from the plane.

584
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:39,870
Is that a fact?

585
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:42,490
<i>Yes. A black man. Very smooth and convincing.</i>

586
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:45,790
I would prefer to deal with him directly 
 for his cowardice...

587
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:49,420
...but should you find it necessary 
 to inflict harm upon him...

588
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,750
... I will not hold you liable.

589
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,510
The man in the plane says you're one 
 of his.

590
00:48:58,590 --> 00:49:02,880
Yeah, well I know about the fuckers who 
 say they saw Elvis in a god damn mall. 
 You gonna believe that shit, too?

591
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,350
Look, he's a murderer!

592
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,680
Let me see some identification, Mr. Cutter.

593
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:13,980
Doesn't say head of security. 
 Says you're an instructor.

594
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:17,190
I'm former head of security 
 for Atlantic International.

595
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:21,360
Put yourself in my place, Mr. Cutter. 
 What would you do if you were me?

596
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:24,340
Kill myself.

597
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:41,130
Wait one hour before resuming the flight. 
 That'll give me sufficient time to escape.

598
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:44,010
Once the plane is back in the air, 
 proceed with the original plan.

599
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:45,300
Let me go with you.

600
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:48,320
I need you to stay here 
 and carry out my instructions.

601
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:52,900
-What if they deny us clearance? 
 -Start killing passengers until they do.

602
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:35,360
Go on, move it!

603
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:37,940
Get going, don't stop! Come on!

604
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:48,670
What the hell is wrong with those people? 
 They'll trample each other to death!

605
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,920
Damn it. It's a trick! You gotta listen to me.

606
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,880
I've had just about all the advice 
 from you I'll take.

607
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:05,630
Haul his ass downstairs.

608
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,760
If he gets cute, shoot him!

609
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:09,890
In the leg.

610
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:12,060
He might be telling the truth.

611
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:16,190
Do me a favor, honey. 
 Fix me a cup of that special coffee.

612
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:18,150
Maybe a couple of Bufferin.

613
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,200
Dammit, you're making a mistake!

614
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:23,400
Shut up, boy! You ain't said shit 
 I want to hear!

615
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,140
Hold it!

616
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:18,470
Chief, prisoner got away.

617
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:19,540
No shit.

618
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:23,250
All right. Call for backup. I want somebody 
 from every sheriff's office around.

619
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,880
He's headed toward the fairground. 
 Want us to head out there?

620
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:29,140
Why? So he can get more practice 
 whipping your dumb ass?

621
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:33,720
All right. Take some men, and keep your damn guns 
 holstered, unless you have no choice.

622
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:35,140
Go!

623
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,310
Come on! Come on!

624
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:51,990
That won't be necessary, Vincent. 
 I'll take care of Mr. Cutter.

625
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:56,210
Secure transportation.

626
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:59,920
Meet us at the other side 
 of the fairground in ten minutes.

627
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:21,030
-Chief Biggs? Dwight Henderson, FBI. 
 -Leonard Biggs, Lake Lucille Police.

628
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:24,440
I need a concise report on the status 
 of this operation, Chief.

629
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:26,110
Make yourself comfortable.

630
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:30,530
That airplane and my blood pressure 
 ain't going a damn bit higher than it is
 right now.

631
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:58,530
Damn!

632
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,800
<i>Flight 163, do you read me?</i>

633
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,300
Flight 163, come in, please.

634
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,920
Flight 163, do you read me?

635
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:15,430
You might as well save your breath. They ain't gonna
 answer you till they're darn ready.

636
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:19,510
All we can do is sit and wait to hear 
 from them or our men in the field.

637
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,880
Just hope that Cutter fella 
 was telling the truth.
 -Cutter?

638
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:25,350
-John Cutter? 
 -You know him?

639
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,940
What happened to him?

640
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:28,940
Well, he said he was on that plane.

641
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:32,320
Beat up a couple of my men, headed towards 
 the fairgrounds. Don't worry, we'll catch him.

642
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,250
I hope you got a good 
 early-retirement plan.

643
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:39,530
Take Dean, Peale and Christopher. 
 Get over to the fairgrounds.

644
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,580
Chief, you better see to it 
 your men don't harm Cutter.

645
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:46,330
Because if he's hurt, I'll press charges 
 against you myself.

646
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,200
Move!

647
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,110
Freeze! Don't move!

648
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:58,360
FBI! You're under arrest!

649
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:01,190
Let him go!

650
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:12,500
Look. There's another one. Five feet 10 inches, 
 he's got a tan jacket and blue, navy pants.

651
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,290
Check around.

652
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:59,130
Watch yourself!

653
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:04,550
Get him out of there.
 -Cutter.

654
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,480
Dwight Henderson, FBI.

655
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:09,850
-Heard a great deal about you. 
 -Pleasure's mutual.

656
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:12,180
-You all right, man? 
 -Yeah, I'm fine.

657
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:14,810
What is wrong with you? 
 That's your idea of a surprise?

658
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:17,060
You fucking put me on a plane 
 with a god damn terrorist?

659
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:20,160
Relax, nobody knew. 
 The FBI didn't notify us!
 -Hold it.

660
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:25,240
Those two agents you murdered 
 on the plane were friends of mine.

661
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:30,120
Thanks for telling me. I do enjoy knowing 
 the people whose lives I've touched.

662
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:33,660
I got enough of this! And you're gonna help us 
 or I'll rip your goddamn throat out!

663
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:34,700
Come on now.

664
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:37,120
While you're considering organ donations...

665
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:41,680
...it might be wise of you to spare some thought 
 for the remaining passengers on board.

666
01:00:42,210 --> 01:00:46,470
If I'm not released, you'll be clearing up 
 their remains for quite some time.

667
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:48,380
What are you talking about, asshole?

668
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:52,890
My colleagues have instructions 
 to start killing passengers in 20 minutes.

669
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:56,390
Get this piece of shit inside.

670
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:03,900
I'll station some of my men 
 behind the plane with tear gas and masks.

671
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:06,910
Two agents will escort Rane 
 up the boarding stairs.

672
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:08,900
Meaning you're just gonna let him back 
 on that airplane?

673
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:11,240
-This is what we're going to tell them. 
 -How are your sharpshooters?

674
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,580
-Got two of the best. 
 -They're not going to get a second chance.

675
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:15,080
They won't need it.

676
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,660
Sharpshooters?

677
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:20,850
What about Rane's people that are still 
 on the airplane? What about them?

678
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,590
Just be patient., ok?

679
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:26,130
Look, I'm the only one who knows who they are. 
 I can be wired.

680
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:29,840
I can signal to Henderson's men 
 when it's safe to shoot who's at the door.

681
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:34,010
We take out Rane first, ok? 
 Then will it still give you enough time to
 use the tear gas?

682
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:37,110
My men will start up the stairs 
 when the first shots are fired.

683
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:38,770
We'll already have the door secured.

684
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:41,610
I don't know. This sounds too
 crazy, John. It's....

685
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:43,690
Too much that can go wrong.

686
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:45,830
Goddamn it, Sly! Listen!

687
01:01:46,110 --> 01:01:49,950
I saw him take a passenger on that plane. 
 He asked about his family...

688
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:53,370
...then blew his brains out 
 all over the goddamn floor.

689
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:58,620
Look. The longer we wait, 
 the more people are gonna be sacrificed.

690
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:00,370
Fine.

691
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:04,680
All right. I'll go tell Rane. 
 I'll make it look like he negotiated it.

692
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:08,090
No.

693
01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:10,640
Let me tell him.

694
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:12,050
Alone.

695
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:17,930
Sure.

696
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,610
John?

697
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:26,820
You okay?

698
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:30,990
Yeah. I'm all right.
-Okay.

699
01:03:12,070 --> 01:03:15,200
Mr. Cutter, how kind of you 
 to pay me a visit.

700
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,240
You've been a worthy adversary.

701
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:21,120
It's a shame we won't be seeing 
 much more of each other.

702
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,920
Let me tell you something.

703
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,420
If anybody else gets hurt on that plane...

704
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:29,560
...so it gonna take a hell lot more than a prison cell 
 to keep me from ripping your nuts off!

705
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:32,840
I'd come to expect more from you 
 than cheap vulgarities.

706
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:36,510
You and I both know I will never see 
 the inside of a prison.

707
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:40,100
The notion of good over evil 
 will not allow you to sit idly by...

708
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:43,350
...and watch the needless death 
 of your fellow citizens.

709
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:47,820
You know, Rane, you got a good point. 
 Maybe I should just kill you right here.

710
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:51,190
You wouldn't take advantage 
 of a helpless man, would you?

711
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,070
It's never stopped you.

712
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:57,030
That's the American way, isn't it...

713
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:58,240
...brother?

714
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:02,040
You should know. 
 You're used to being taken advantage of.

715
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:04,010
I want them off the plane, Rane.

716
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:07,830
We share the same hunger. 
 We're both killers. I know the breed, Cutter.

717
01:04:12,550 --> 01:04:14,020
I'm sick of your shit!

718
01:04:14,090 --> 01:04:16,970
You need the passengers. 
 I want the plane.

719
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:19,810
Put me back on board 
 and the passengers will be released.

720
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:22,680
-Yeah right. I'm supposed to trust you? 
 -Trust your instincts.

721
01:04:22,770 --> 01:04:25,530
My instincts are to wax your ass 
 all over this floor.

722
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:29,630
Those are your emotions acting 
 without the benefit of intellect.
Now..

723
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:33,150
The passengers' lives are in your hands.

724
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:36,400
Don't fail them.

725
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:39,700
Sit down!

726
01:04:56,590 --> 01:04:58,590
Why are you keeping us here?

727
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:01,760
What do you want? 
 For God's sake, let us go!

728
01:05:01,890 --> 01:05:03,390
It's all right. It's all right.

729
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:07,180
Don't give him a reason to hurt you. 
 That's exactly what they want.

730
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:09,100
Just try and remain calm.

731
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:10,350
There you go.

732
01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:12,940
Everything's gonna be all right.

733
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:15,240
All right?

734
01:05:22,410 --> 01:05:24,540
<i>Flight 163, this is Daddy.</i>

735
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:27,200
I will be rejoining you very shortly.

736
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:30,750
If I'm not safely on board 
 within five minutes...

737
01:05:30,830 --> 01:05:33,880
...you are to continue 
 as previously instructed.

738
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:38,510
Gentlemen, I'm ready to leave 
 your lovely little town.

739
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:21,720
All right. This is Cutter. Everybody in position?

740
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:25,450
Loud and clear, Mr. Cutter and target is well 
 within range. Awaiting your command.

741
01:06:25,850 --> 01:06:28,970
That's a 10-4. Nobody does anything 
 until I say, "go."

742
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:53,790
All right! All units stand by.

743
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:07,970
Now! Take him!

744
01:07:09,770 --> 01:07:10,890
Take him!

745
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,130
-How is it? 
 -It's okay.

746
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:38,090
-Okay, good. 
 -It's all right.

747
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,930
Get this plane off the ground! Move!

748
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:08,460
Move around!

749
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,310
Biggs, drive!

750
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:30,640
-Where? 
 -Follow the fucking plane!

751
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:35,730
Go!

752
01:08:36,730 --> 01:08:37,810
Go!

753
01:08:41,730 --> 01:08:44,030
<i>I hope you enjoyed your stopover.</i>

754
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:47,200
<i>We'll now continue with the remainder</i> 
 <i>of the flight.</i>

755
01:08:47,530 --> 01:08:51,240
If you don't want to wear your seat belts, 
 you don't have to.

756
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:54,590
What do we do when we catch it?

757
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:57,250
-You'll watch me sneak on the plane. 
   without a ticket.
 -What?

758
01:08:57,830 --> 01:09:01,210
I knew you were crazy the minute 
 I laid eyes on your ass.

759
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:05,010
Chief, I thought all you biscuit-eating boys 
 knew how to drive!

760
01:09:05,170 --> 01:09:06,920
Was that a bunch of bullshit or what?

761
01:09:07,130 --> 01:09:09,760
I ain't had a challenge like that 
 since I was high school.

762
01:09:09,850 --> 01:09:12,180
Chief, I didn't know you went to high school.

763
01:09:12,310 --> 01:09:14,560
This better be covered 
 by the health insurance.

764
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:17,180
Yeah, it's under the section on mental illness.

765
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:22,570
Bring it close to the landing gear!

766
01:09:26,190 --> 01:09:27,320
I need a gun!

767
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,360
You need your head examined!
 It's what you need!

768
01:09:29,530 --> 01:09:32,380
I want this back in good condition. It belonged to my wife's.

769
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:36,080
Bring your ass back alive, do you hear me?

770
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:39,180
Miss the opportunity to get back at you? 
 No way!

771
01:09:39,330 --> 01:09:40,800
Let's do it!

772
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:57,350
I got a bad feeling about this. 
 I got a bad feeling about this one.

773
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:00,350
Oh, man!

774
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:15,120
Flight Control, this is Lake Lucille. 
 We have a hijacked aircraft.

775
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:18,080
I want every radar station 
 in the Southeast following the plane.

776
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:20,840
They're on it already. 
 Do you read me, Approach Control?

777
01:10:26,050 --> 01:10:29,220
Mr. Forget, it's time 
 to make the proper arrangements.

778
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:47,150
Your friend, Mr. Cutter, 
 has left you in a rather precarious position.

779
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,030
Pour me a drink.

780
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:53,820
What do you want?

781
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,830
Anything wet.

782
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:10,010
Did you enjoy yourself down there 
 in the lower galley?

783
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:14,550
You and your friend in that tight, 
 little place?

784
01:11:17,180 --> 01:11:18,680
Tell me, Marti.

785
01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:21,600
Did the hero get into your...

786
01:11:21,890 --> 01:11:23,810
...tight, little place?

787
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:27,620
You're repulsive!

788
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,610
You'll change your mind 
 once we get to know each other.

789
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:36,530
You'll have to kill me first.

790
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:39,030
No, Marti...

791
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:42,410
...I'm going to kill you during.

792
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:19,270
It's almost time. What the hell 
 is taking Forget so long?

793
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:21,600
Maybe he's having difficulty 
 finding the trunk.

794
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:22,850
Idiot.

795
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:46,870
Who're you?

796
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:49,120
Cutter. John Cutter.

797
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:52,040
Chill out. I'm the good guy.

798
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:54,040
-Where are they? 
 -In the back.

799
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:57,800
All right. Can you turn the plane around 
 and land at the airfield we just left?

800
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,130
I did it once.

801
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:00,380
Do it again.

802
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:01,640
You got it.

803
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:07,900
Center, Atlantic International 163 with you.

804
01:14:18,110 --> 01:14:20,740
Something's wrong. Check the flight crew.

805
01:14:27,870 --> 01:14:29,370
Why did you turn the plane?

806
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:30,660
We were told to head back.

807
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:32,420
-By whom? 
 -By me.

808
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:39,760
What a waste.

809
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:43,220
Keep that on her. If she moves, 
 throw her out the window.

810
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:44,890
Need help?

811
01:14:45,470 --> 01:14:47,220
No, there's only one left.

812
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:48,930
He's all mine.

813
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,120
Open it.

814
01:15:55,630 --> 01:15:57,290
Oh, shit! Shit!

815
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:39,600
<i>Control Tower, this is John Cutter,</i> 
 <i>Line 163, do you read me?</i>

816
01:17:39,690 --> 01:17:41,360
Loud and clear, John. What's your status?

817
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:44,740
Single at the moment...

818
01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:46,530
...but I'm working on it.

819
01:17:46,610 --> 01:17:49,540
Cutter, this is Henderson. 
 Have you disabled Rane yet?

820
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:51,670
You're damn skippy.

821
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:53,780
All right, Cutter!

822
01:17:53,950 --> 01:17:55,340
<i>Hey, Biggs...</i>

823
01:17:55,410 --> 01:17:57,460
...how you doing? Is this you?

824
01:17:57,870 --> 01:17:59,120
In the flesh.

825
01:17:59,370 --> 01:18:01,210
That's a revolting thought.

826
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:07,360
Hey, there. Have you seen John Cutter?

827
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:09,900
Yeah, last time I saw him, 
 he was with a flight attendant.

828
01:19:09,990 --> 01:19:11,320
Okay, thanks.

829
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,210
Tell Ramsey I'm taking a vacation.

830
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:27,380
Done!

831
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:29,270
And I want a raise.

832
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:30,760
Done.

833
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:33,300
-Ready to get out of here? 
 -Where do you want to go?

834
01:19:33,390 --> 01:19:34,890
Any place but here.

835
01:19:36,390 --> 01:19:38,190
What about these reporters?

836
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:40,390
Hey, John. What should I do about the reporters?

837
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,560
John, this isn't my bag!

838
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:03,580
Are you a representative of the airline?

839
01:20:03,670 --> 01:20:08,050
Yes, and I'm pleased to report 
 that our special anti-terrorist program...

840
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:11,130
...which was enacted 
 under my supervision...

841
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:13,260
...was an extraordinary success.

842
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:14,980
What's your name?

843
01:20:15,090 --> 01:20:16,680
Sly Delvecchio.

844
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:21,570
You all riding or walking?

845
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:22,680
Walk!

846
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:25,600
Five miles to town.

847
01:20:26,350 --> 01:20:27,610
No, thanks.

848
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:30,610
Cutter, did you happen to see my
 wife's gun, did you?

849
01:20:32,690 --> 01:20:34,080
Good night.

850
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:35,830
Good night, Biggs.
