1
00:01:02,248 --> 00:01:04,524
I can't come now.
I'm cleaning this up.

2
00:01:12,696 --> 00:01:15,860
How are you doing up there?
You about done?

3
00:01:22,842 --> 00:01:24,504
Lift up.

4
00:01:24,679 --> 00:01:26,238
Hey, give me some slack,
will you?

5
00:01:26,415 --> 00:01:30,614
- What the hell is this thing anyway?
- What do you mean, "What is it?" It's art.

6
00:01:37,661 --> 00:01:40,461
Hurry up, you turkey.

7
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:45,867
Do you think you might possibly be finished
before the dedication tomorrow?

8
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,475
- Catch.
- I can do it.

9
00:01:48,644 --> 00:01:50,408
Hey!

10
00:02:05,934 --> 00:02:07,800
Okay, people.

11
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,873
I don't want any of you to forget
there is no extra credit for this.

12
00:02:12,043 --> 00:02:14,877
Don't turn into an angry mob.

13
00:02:15,447 --> 00:02:17,847
Now, listen. I want the term
papers in by Wednesday...

14
00:02:18,017 --> 00:02:20,043
...and tell Becky
I want it legible. Okay?

15
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,813
Police the area.

16
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:24,184
- I gotta go.
- Okay.

17
00:02:24,558 --> 00:02:26,048
- You really did it.
- Yeah?

18
00:02:26,227 --> 00:02:28,662
Yup. I'm really proud of you.

19
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,298
- That's really something.
- Yeah?

20
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:33,595
- You really made a...
- Yeah.

21
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:36,138
...big pile of sticks.

22
00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:38,942
I used you as a model.

23
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,822
I gotta go.

24
00:02:49,993 --> 00:02:52,622
All right, I'm cooking tonight.
What do you want?

25
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,794
Just a salad or something,
you know.

26
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:58,426
How about baked Alaska?

27
00:02:59,673 --> 00:03:03,873
- How about a lobster Newburger, baby?
- Give me a break.

28
00:03:05,281 --> 00:03:07,772
- How about M&M's?
- M&M's sound good.

29
00:03:08,784 --> 00:03:11,310
- I'll see you later.
- See you tonight.

30
00:03:13,825 --> 00:03:16,818
<i>Fly ball to second.
This will put it away and that's it.</i>

31
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:19,794
<i>Total of five runs, 10 hits
and two errors for the Mariners.</i>

32
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,994
<i>Eight runs, nine hits
and two errors for the Red Sox.</i>

33
00:03:36,555 --> 00:03:38,922
<i>Charlie Snow inviting
you to see...</i>

34
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,844
Watch your head, Joe.

35
00:04:30,428 --> 00:04:34,457
Gurney coming through.
Open it wide. Come on.

36
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,741
How you doing now?
Take it easy.

37
00:04:44,914 --> 00:04:46,848
You all right now?

38
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,527
Stay back.

39
00:05:01,237 --> 00:05:04,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Watch it. That's jagged.

40
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:13,746
<i>- unit 612. We've got
a possible broken neck here.</i>

41
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,554
<i>Trauma, double fractures, lacerations.
The man is cyanotic. BPis 160/90...</i>

42
00:05:19,728 --> 00:05:20,923
Move it. Out of the way.

43
00:05:21,097 --> 00:05:22,929
To the right. Off to the right.

44
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,092
Lisa, I need your help.
Ventilate this guy.

45
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,967
- Dorothy, 1 gram of Solu-Medrol.
- One gram Solu-Medrol.

46
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,109
- Two units of plasma.
- Two units of plasma.

47
00:05:31,277 --> 00:05:34,304
Type and cross-match.
Possible pneumothorax.

48
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:38,111
I can feel at least four fractured ribs
in this guy. And fractured pelvis.

49
00:05:38,286 --> 00:05:40,221
- Who's the anesthesiologist?
- Levinson.

50
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:42,858
Tell him 15 minutes.
Get him into X-ray, stat.

51
00:05:43,026 --> 00:05:46,394
- Right tibia, left tibia fracture and fibula.
- You hang in there, pal.

52
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:49,692
- Come on, you gotta fight. Fight.
- Move him out.

53
00:05:49,868 --> 00:05:53,566
You have a fractured right rib puncturing
the right lung, so a pneumothorax.

54
00:05:53,739 --> 00:05:56,767
We have a fractured left tibia and fibula,
right tibia and fibula.

55
00:05:56,945 --> 00:06:00,438
- God, what didn't he break?
- I think this is gonna be our problem here.

56
00:06:00,616 --> 00:06:02,517
- Shit.
- He's never going to dance again.

57
00:06:02,686 --> 00:06:05,918
We'll have to very gently
fuse this spinal column together.

58
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,425
I can do that. I think the best
we can hope for, though, is a quad.

59
00:06:09,595 --> 00:06:12,962
- I want him alive, Tony.
- I'll do the best job I can.

60
00:06:13,132 --> 00:06:15,328
- Get started?
- Yeah.

61
00:06:57,126 --> 00:06:59,526
- How you doing on your side, baby?
- Oh, pretty good.

62
00:06:59,695 --> 00:07:04,725
Okay, now one more knot to go
and we are in terrific shape.

63
00:07:04,902 --> 00:07:06,962
Over easy, please.

64
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:09,472
One, two, three...

65
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:12,870
Good.

66
00:07:13,715 --> 00:07:15,240
- Hi.
- Hi.

67
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:19,616
- Thought I recognized those shoes.
- Well, I wore them just for you.

68
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:23,521
- Dizzy? You want anything?
- I'd like a martini.

69
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:27,529
He wants a martini. Alrighty.

70
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:32,438
Now how's that?

71
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,778
- Gin tastes like water.
- It is water.

72
00:07:37,947 --> 00:07:41,885
I thought everyone
in Intensive Care got gin.

73
00:07:42,053 --> 00:07:44,749
Well, intravenously.

74
00:07:45,523 --> 00:07:48,049
- Hey, honey?
- Yeah?

75
00:07:48,227 --> 00:07:51,756
You know that dinner dance
next Saturday?

76
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,159
I think we ought to tell
them we'll be late.

77
00:07:56,338 --> 00:07:57,863
Okay.

78
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,320
You want to come along, Miss Sadler?

79
00:08:33,488 --> 00:08:35,582
Yes, ma'am.

80
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,361
Good morning, Mr. Harrison.

81
00:08:44,403 --> 00:08:46,634
- Good morning, Mr. Harrison.
- Morning, Rodriguez.

82
00:08:46,806 --> 00:08:49,332
- Here's a new face for you.
- Hello, new face, hello.

83
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,708
Rodriguez, I thought you were gonna
bring me ugly old hags.

84
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:54,542
Going down.

85
00:08:54,716 --> 00:08:57,515
Orthopedics, Gynecology,
Nurses' Station...

86
00:08:57,687 --> 00:09:01,055
...Rubber Goods, Water Sports.
- Get the pillows out from under his arms.

87
00:09:01,225 --> 00:09:02,693
Watch it.

88
00:09:03,128 --> 00:09:05,563
Arms over chest.

89
00:09:05,731 --> 00:09:07,666
Down with the sheets...

90
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:09,666
...and the spread.

91
00:09:09,837 --> 00:09:13,330
- Neatly, neatly. - Why don't you
say something nice to her?

92
00:09:13,742 --> 00:09:15,039
You need a haircut.

93
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:17,237
That's nice.

94
00:09:17,414 --> 00:09:20,441
Ready? And...

95
00:09:20,618 --> 00:09:22,086
...good.

96
00:09:23,121 --> 00:09:26,250
- Now...
- Hello, darling.

97
00:09:26,426 --> 00:09:31,024
- My little flesh pudding.
- Align the legs.

98
00:09:31,767 --> 00:09:35,067
Up. Over.

99
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:37,867
- Hear the one about the
plastic surgeon? - No.

100
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,476
He melted in front of the fire.

101
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,307
- You get it in the end, don't you?
- Terrible.

102
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,646
- Thank you very much.
- Now rub.

103
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:50,985
I see any bedsores,
it's gonna be you and me.

104
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,889
Used to dream of situations like this.

105
00:09:54,063 --> 00:09:57,363
- Being injured? - Being massaged
by two beautiful women.

106
00:09:57,534 --> 00:10:01,699
Lay off or I'll keep
my student nurses out of here.

107
00:10:03,943 --> 00:10:06,435
- You think you can manage?
- Yes, ma'am.

108
00:10:06,613 --> 00:10:09,447
Well, be careful.
We don't wanna have him on the floor.

109
00:10:09,617 --> 00:10:13,715
Oh, God. Somebody have
me on the floor.

110
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:17,327
I was once had on the floor, Rodriguez.
It was incredible.

111
00:10:17,495 --> 00:10:19,691
You are impossible.

112
00:10:20,032 --> 00:10:22,558
Make that improbable.

113
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,462
- So what's your name?
- Mary Jo Sadler.

114
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,871
- Most of my friends call me Joey.
- That's nice.

115
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:32,014
Don't let Rodriguez hear you say that.
You're supposed to answer:

116
00:10:32,181 --> 00:10:37,313
"Miss Sadler," with a smile that is filled
with warmth but not a hint of sex.

117
00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:39,649
- Sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

118
00:10:39,824 --> 00:10:43,887
I'm gonna call you Joey when we're alone
and you're caressing my backside.

119
00:10:44,064 --> 00:10:48,798
- I'm rubbing your heels right...
- Don't spoil it. I can't feel a thing anyway.

120
00:10:50,072 --> 00:10:52,769
- Am I your first back rub, Joey?
- Yes, you are.

121
00:10:52,942 --> 00:10:55,673
- I graduate in two weeks.
- Really?

122
00:10:55,846 --> 00:10:57,337
- Anybody home?
- Joey, quick!

123
00:10:57,515 --> 00:10:59,950
Get under the bed.
It's the other woman.

124
00:11:00,586 --> 00:11:01,883
- Hi.
- Are you going to class?

125
00:11:02,255 --> 00:11:03,950
Rehearsal.

126
00:11:05,827 --> 00:11:08,422
- Does he ever stop?
- Stop? I haven't laid a glove on her.

127
00:11:08,597 --> 00:11:11,863
- I don't know. It's my first day with him.
- Oh, you'll learn. I'm Pat.

128
00:11:12,035 --> 00:11:13,434
- I'm Miss Sadler.
- And for you.

129
00:11:13,603 --> 00:11:14,593
- Beautiful.
- Beautiful.

130
00:11:14,772 --> 00:11:16,364
- Well, good morning.
- Good morning.

131
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,031
- How are you this morning?
- Okay.

132
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,406
- And how are we doing here?
- Fine.

133
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,709
Miss Rodriguez, you promised me
you wouldn't send cute ones in here.

134
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:25,875
Should've seen the one in here
last night.

135
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:29,354
After lights out, she snuck me out.
We went skateboarding.

136
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,126
Only trouble was,
I was the skateboard.

137
00:11:32,295 --> 00:11:34,160
No, no, no!

138
00:11:35,499 --> 00:11:39,130
- Are you finished, Miss Sadler?
- I...

139
00:11:39,304 --> 00:11:43,332
Pillows. Right.

140
00:11:43,778 --> 00:11:45,609
And...

141
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,715
one...

142
00:11:50,888 --> 00:11:55,587
okay, could you straighten my hand out?
And bend the hand down...

143
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:57,853
...palm down into the pillow?

144
00:11:59,832 --> 00:12:03,270
That's it, that's it.
Now smooth the fingers out.

145
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:05,964
That's it. Perfect.

146
00:12:06,141 --> 00:12:09,669
Now... Now, bend the thumb
a little bit in.

147
00:12:10,413 --> 00:12:11,574
That's it, that's it.

148
00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:14,747
That's it. Now relax the
hand just a little bit.

149
00:12:15,554 --> 00:12:17,317
That's it. Thank you.

150
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,726
I gotta keep going. Give me a kiss.

151
00:12:23,764 --> 00:12:25,357
Love you, okay?

152
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:28,034
I got some steps to work out
before the rehearsal.

153
00:12:28,204 --> 00:12:31,197
- How's your knee? - It's okay,
if I warm it up really carefully.

154
00:12:31,374 --> 00:12:34,242
Kallis is coming again.
He's interested in the large nude.

155
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:37,479
Kallis always was interested
in large nudes.

156
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:40,711
Try and make him behave, Rodriguez.
Nice meeting you.

157
00:12:40,888 --> 00:12:42,321
- Bye. Tomorrow.
- Bye.

158
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,479
Alrighty.

159
00:12:43,657 --> 00:12:48,255
- Are you comfortable, Mr. Harrison?
- Rodriguez, you give great sheet.

160
00:12:49,232 --> 00:12:53,170
- Go to sleep or something.
- What's the "or something"?

161
00:12:53,338 --> 00:12:55,136
Stay awake.

162
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:00,443
- How long has he been like...?
- Six months.

163
00:13:00,615 --> 00:13:02,914
- Will he ever be able to...?
- Nope.

164
00:13:03,485 --> 00:13:06,317
John, Mr. Harrison's ready.
You better do him now.

165
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:09,013
Well, he ain't going nowhere, man.

166
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,806
- What you say, man?
- Uh-oh, a black man with a razor.

167
00:13:24,313 --> 00:13:27,305
Okay, fleet-foot,
let's see you tap-dance.

168
00:13:27,783 --> 00:13:30,514
Okay, here we go.

169
00:13:31,522 --> 00:13:34,287
Man, but this is boring, you know.

170
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:36,826
Shaving dudes all day.

171
00:13:36,996 --> 00:13:38,555
They won't let me near the girls.

172
00:13:38,732 --> 00:13:41,395
All you could get near is the ones
with the mustaches.

173
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,540
- Bitchy, bitchy.
- Envy, envy.

174
00:13:45,174 --> 00:13:47,609
- Listen, from where I'm laying...
- Yeah?

175
00:13:47,778 --> 00:13:51,271
...if I could get off at all,
even by myself, that'd be great.

176
00:13:51,449 --> 00:13:54,384
- I hear that, man. I hear that.
- John.

177
00:13:54,552 --> 00:13:57,784
Shake it out. Dr. Emerson's making
his rounds this morning.

178
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:01,395
If I shake it any harder, man,
it's gonna fall off, you know?

179
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,865
- So how's the punk band coming?
- Oh, great, man.

180
00:14:05,033 --> 00:14:08,436
I even added a xylophone
to the band.

181
00:14:09,206 --> 00:14:12,404
Punk xylophone?
How the hell does that sound?

182
00:14:12,577 --> 00:14:15,376
Man, great.
We be jamming and I ain't jiving.

183
00:14:15,548 --> 00:14:17,243
Listen.

184
00:14:18,285 --> 00:14:20,516
Hey, man, this knee needs tuning up,
you know.

185
00:14:43,685 --> 00:14:46,952
Hey, John, John, John.
This isn't your day.

186
00:14:47,124 --> 00:14:50,993
- What's going on here?
- He was testing my reflexes.

187
00:14:51,162 --> 00:14:55,191
Yeah, you see, Dr. Scott,
this man's toe bone connected...

188
00:14:55,368 --> 00:14:58,065
...to his knee bone.
And I'm just connecting myself...

189
00:14:58,239 --> 00:15:01,231
...to another patient.
- Goodbye.

190
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,341
Well, we're all bright
and chipper this morning.

191
00:15:04,514 --> 00:15:07,075
Oh, it's marvelous,
the courage of the human spirit.

192
00:15:07,251 --> 00:15:09,880
Nice to hear the
human spirit's okay.

193
00:15:10,055 --> 00:15:11,956
How's the heart?

194
00:15:26,243 --> 00:15:28,405
- Then they went to the lobby...
- Selling tickets.

195
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,846
- You heard that one?
- Yes, you told me twice yesterday.

196
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:36,517
- Our relationship must be on the skids.
- You're looking great today, Mr. Harrison.

197
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:40,856
Take a deep breath for me.
Hold it. Let it out.

198
00:15:41,797 --> 00:15:45,233
Okay, I think we can start stepping
up your physical therapy now.

199
00:15:45,401 --> 00:15:47,233
To what purpose?

200
00:15:47,704 --> 00:15:48,763
To what purpose?

201
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:53,003
So that you can feel more comfortable
and start leading a more normal life.

202
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:54,976
- More normal, huh?
- Yes, more normal.

203
00:15:55,148 --> 00:15:57,515
Meaning I can resume
my basketball career?

204
00:15:57,686 --> 00:16:00,087
No, I think you're a little
too short for basketball.

205
00:16:00,256 --> 00:16:02,953
- Cute.
- Thank you.

206
00:16:03,761 --> 00:16:06,959
I see Dr. Emerson is making rounds
again this morning.

207
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,895
- Yes, he is.
- Is he gonna do it...

208
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:11,901
...in the normal fashion
or is he gonna walk on water?

209
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,097
Look up for me, please.

210
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:16,438
That isn't fair, you know.

211
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:19,980
You're very lucky to have him.
He's the best one around.

212
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,619
I'll remember that in my prayers.

213
00:16:22,787 --> 00:16:24,721
Okay, see you in a few minutes.

214
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:27,051
- With Emerson?
- Right.

215
00:16:27,225 --> 00:16:29,421
I won't hold my breath.

216
00:16:32,532 --> 00:16:36,560
Miss Rodriguez, Mr. Harrison seems
a bit more agitated this morning.

217
00:16:36,738 --> 00:16:38,865
He's beginning to realize
what he's up against.

218
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,308
That's what I thought. Okay, I'm
upping his valium to 5 milligrams.

219
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,316
- Valium, 5 milligrams. TID?
- Right. Thank you.

220
00:16:47,653 --> 00:16:49,884
What, in your enlightened opinion,
Mr. Hoffman...

221
00:16:50,056 --> 00:16:53,117
...was Mr. Holmes suffering from?
- I'd say pneumonia.

222
00:16:53,293 --> 00:16:56,195
No, it wasn't pneumonia.
All third-year students say pneumonia.

223
00:16:56,364 --> 00:16:59,334
It wasn't pneumonia
and it wasn't arthritis. Hello, Jim.

224
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,740
How long?

225
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,902
About 12 minutes.

226
00:17:08,615 --> 00:17:11,585
- What did you do?
- Palpated radial artery.

227
00:17:11,752 --> 00:17:16,849
- Gave him D5W, bicarb and epinephrine.
- Why didn't you transfer him to ICU?

228
00:17:17,024 --> 00:17:22,020
Well, his vitals were stable at 6:00.
He just went sour real fast.

229
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:26,302
This was Andrew Dryer, age 56.
Out of surgery yesterday.

230
00:17:26,471 --> 00:17:29,202
Cancer of the colon and liver.

231
00:17:31,111 --> 00:17:32,635
What's your name?

232
00:17:32,813 --> 00:17:34,543
- Everett, sir.
- Well, Mr. Everett...

233
00:17:34,716 --> 00:17:37,083
...how do you feel about this?
- Feel, sir?

234
00:17:37,253 --> 00:17:39,983
Yes, feel. You feel sick
when you look at this?

235
00:17:40,155 --> 00:17:42,522
- No, sir.
- Why not?

236
00:17:43,027 --> 00:17:45,428
- I'm used to seeing bodies, sir.
- Oh, I see.

237
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:49,830
You been here, what? Three years?
Cut up cadavers with the best of them.

238
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:51,631
Death holds no fear for you...

239
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:53,398
...does it, Mr. Everett?

240
00:17:53,575 --> 00:17:57,171
- Sir... - Let me tell you.
This makes me sick.

241
00:17:57,347 --> 00:17:59,281
It ought to make you sick too.

242
00:17:59,449 --> 00:18:00,917
Look there.

243
00:18:01,085 --> 00:18:02,676
That's the enemy.

244
00:18:02,853 --> 00:18:04,981
The enemy has won.

245
00:18:05,156 --> 00:18:08,649
Mr. Dryer was 56 years old.
And I want you, Mr. Everett...

246
00:18:08,827 --> 00:18:12,765
...and I want all of you
to feel sick when you see a body...

247
00:18:12,934 --> 00:18:16,963
...that hasn't reached its allotted
three-score years and 10.

248
00:18:17,407 --> 00:18:21,435
That's if you want to be doctors.
Not just money-grubbers.

249
00:18:27,386 --> 00:18:29,047
Shit.

250
00:18:33,962 --> 00:18:35,828
Oh, sorry.

251
00:18:35,998 --> 00:18:41,405
<i>Dr. Arlene Franklin,
sixth floor waiting area, please.</i>

252
00:18:44,544 --> 00:18:46,911
Did you say something to me, man?

253
00:18:47,081 --> 00:18:48,912
I think she likes me.

254
00:18:50,484 --> 00:18:52,179
- Hello, hello.
- Hi.

255
00:18:52,353 --> 00:18:54,117
Is that something to
put into my face?

256
00:18:54,289 --> 00:18:56,087
It's coffee.

257
00:18:56,959 --> 00:18:58,689
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

258
00:18:58,862 --> 00:19:00,124
- No, it's not.
- It is.

259
00:19:00,297 --> 00:19:01,287
- It's not.
- It is.

260
00:19:01,466 --> 00:19:03,435
- It's caca.
- No, it's not.

261
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:06,265
- Oh, really? - It's good for you.
You have to drink it.

262
00:19:06,439 --> 00:19:08,806
- Looks like somebody already drank it.
- Take a sip.

263
00:19:08,976 --> 00:19:11,171
- I don't want any of it.
- It's not that...

264
00:19:11,345 --> 00:19:13,814
Oh, shit, I'm sorry.

265
00:19:13,982 --> 00:19:16,975
- I'm sorry. It was my fault.
- It's all right, I can clean it up.

266
00:19:17,153 --> 00:19:20,055
- I'm sorry.
- I'll just change the sheets.

267
00:19:20,224 --> 00:19:21,852
Don't panic.

268
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:26,990
How someone who can't move a muscle
can screw up a whole bed is...

269
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:31,396
- It's just eating its way through my P.J.'s.
- I have to pull you towards me.

270
00:19:32,307 --> 00:19:35,641
- Oh, God.
- I feel like Charlie McCarthy.

271
00:19:37,848 --> 00:19:40,716
- Oh, God. - How did the
quadriplegic cross the road?

272
00:19:40,886 --> 00:19:43,719
- Oh, I don't know.
- It was stapled to a chicken.

273
00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:46,582
Joey! Joey!

274
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:48,557
- Help! Nurse!
- Oh, God, oh, God...

275
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:52,724
Nurse, help!
Somebody help! Nurse!

276
00:19:52,902 --> 00:19:55,701
- Help!
- John! Got him.

277
00:19:55,872 --> 00:19:58,272
- Somebody help!
- I got him.

278
00:19:58,442 --> 00:19:59,774
- What happened?
- I don't know.

279
00:19:59,944 --> 00:20:01,377
- Get him on the floor.
- Got him?

280
00:20:01,546 --> 00:20:04,676
All right. Ease him down.
Let's just set him down.

281
00:20:04,851 --> 00:20:07,650
- Take it easy, now, watch it.
- Watch your head, man!

282
00:20:07,955 --> 00:20:10,857
- Give me a clean sheet.
- I just spilled the coffee.

283
00:20:11,393 --> 00:20:15,024
- Okay, get ready to lift him.
- It wasn't her fault.

284
00:20:16,701 --> 00:20:20,831
It wasn't her fault.
It was just an accident.

285
00:20:21,005 --> 00:20:23,133
Get ready for a lift.

286
00:20:24,711 --> 00:20:27,738
- What's going on here?
- Get out of here.

287
00:20:27,915 --> 00:20:30,749
They're just changing the sheets.

288
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:32,580
That's all for now.
See you tomorrow.

289
00:20:32,754 --> 00:20:35,849
- Turn him on his back.
- Easy, man, watch the head, now.

290
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:37,994
- Easy.
- Watch him. You got to be gentle.

291
00:20:38,162 --> 00:20:42,429
On the count of three.
Okay, one, two, three.

292
00:20:42,601 --> 00:20:44,092
Roll the body.

293
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,205
- Slowly. Slowly.
- Easy now.

294
00:20:46,373 --> 00:20:48,000
Out of the way.

295
00:20:48,175 --> 00:20:50,508
- You dizzy?
- No.

296
00:20:50,678 --> 00:20:52,112
Pillow, please.

297
00:20:52,281 --> 00:20:54,944
- What happened here?
- He almost fell out of bed, doctor.

298
00:20:55,118 --> 00:20:56,711
Really?

299
00:20:57,121 --> 00:20:58,680
- How do you feel?
- Great.

300
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:01,156
It's always good to get out
of bed now and again.

301
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:04,930
Let me take a look at you.

302
00:21:07,234 --> 00:21:09,066
Now move your head.

303
00:21:09,437 --> 00:21:11,269
Gently.

304
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,733
Gently.

305
00:21:13,977 --> 00:21:16,344
- Does that hurt?
- No.

306
00:21:22,221 --> 00:21:25,818
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah.

307
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,894
- You'll be fine.
- Are you kidding?

308
00:21:29,063 --> 00:21:30,998
Have the chart, please?

309
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:34,136
Miss, can I have the chart, please?

310
00:21:34,504 --> 00:21:36,473
Just breathe normally.

311
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:45,985
- I see you upped his valium.
- Yes, I did this morning.

312
00:21:46,154 --> 00:21:48,555
The dialysis seems
to be holding him stable.

313
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:52,092
- Just continue the schedule, all right?
- Four hours every other day.

314
00:21:52,262 --> 00:21:53,820
- Right.
- Okay.

315
00:21:53,997 --> 00:21:58,834
Well, Mr. Harrison,
we seem to be out of the woods.

316
00:21:59,339 --> 00:22:04,301
Now, if we can keep you in that bed,
off the accident list, we'll be fine.

317
00:22:05,447 --> 00:22:07,040
When do "we" get discharged?

318
00:22:07,216 --> 00:22:11,312
- Pretty soon now, I expect.
- Really? Discharged? Or transferred?

319
00:22:11,488 --> 00:22:16,483
This unit is for the critically ill, which,
I'm happy to say, you no longer are.

320
00:22:16,661 --> 00:22:18,823
I'll send you to a rehab.
You'll be comfortable.

321
00:22:18,998 --> 00:22:24,768
I get it. You just grow the vegetables here.
The vegetable store is somewhere else.

322
00:22:24,939 --> 00:22:28,137
- I don't think you understand.
- I think I do.

323
00:22:28,443 --> 00:22:30,309
What chance do you think I have...

324
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,883
...of my ever being just
partly dependent on nursing?

325
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,982
- That's difficult to say with any certainty.
- I am not asking for a guarantee.

326
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:41,184
I'm asking for a professional opinion.

327
00:22:42,562 --> 00:22:45,088
You think I'll ever walk again?

328
00:22:45,801 --> 00:22:47,291
No.

329
00:22:49,706 --> 00:22:53,667
- Regain the use of my arms?
- No.

330
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:55,911
Or my...

331
00:22:56,082 --> 00:22:58,017
or my hands?

332
00:22:58,452 --> 00:23:00,078
No.

333
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:08,362
- Thank you.
- What are you thanking me for?

334
00:23:08,731 --> 00:23:10,461
Your honesty.

335
00:23:11,435 --> 00:23:13,927
We were wondering when you'd ask.

336
00:23:15,007 --> 00:23:17,476
Why didn't you tell me before?

337
00:23:17,644 --> 00:23:19,977
We didn't think you'd hear us.

338
00:23:20,147 --> 00:23:22,446
Look, I know it's difficult...

339
00:23:22,617 --> 00:23:26,178
...but it's surprising
how we can come to accept...

340
00:23:26,355 --> 00:23:29,291
You mean, things like
falling out of bed?

341
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,491
Dr. Scott has prescribed something
which I think will help.

342
00:23:32,664 --> 00:23:33,653
- Yes.
- Fabulous.

343
00:23:33,832 --> 00:23:36,597
Get Mrs. Boyle in here.
Let's start some meaningful therapy.

344
00:23:36,769 --> 00:23:38,499
- Right away.
- Isn't that a great idea?

345
00:23:38,672 --> 00:23:41,164
All right, Harrison.
I'll stop in on you later.

346
00:23:41,376 --> 00:23:43,345
Be sure to phone first.

347
00:23:43,512 --> 00:23:46,413
- I may not be in.
- See you later.

348
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,179
Miss Sadler,
let's get a clean gown on him.

349
00:23:50,521 --> 00:23:52,512
What'd you give him,
5 milligrams of valium?

350
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:53,987
Yeah, TID.

351
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,560
I think we may have to up it to 10.

352
00:23:56,729 --> 00:23:59,062
- You might be right.
- I want him transferred out...

353
00:23:59,233 --> 00:24:01,634
...one month, tops.
I have to go to a board meeting.

354
00:24:01,803 --> 00:24:04,204
- Okay. - Talk to some
tight-ass tick-tocks...

355
00:24:04,373 --> 00:24:06,899
...about inflation. - I hope
you have a wonderful time.

356
00:24:07,077 --> 00:24:09,409
I'd rather have my
prostrate examined.

357
00:24:10,213 --> 00:24:12,444
- Excuse me, Mrs. Cole?
- Hold on. Yes, doctor?

358
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:16,919
- Have you given Mr. Harrison his valium?
- No, not until noon.

359
00:24:17,724 --> 00:24:19,590
- Give it to him now.
- Now?

360
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,558
- Yeah.
- Hold on, let me call you back.

361
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:25,428
Oh, wait, just a sec.
On second thought, let me have it.

362
00:24:25,601 --> 00:24:26,967
I'll give it to him myself.

363
00:24:27,337 --> 00:24:32,435
<i>Dr. Norton, report to Hydrotherapy,
fourth floor. Dr. Norton.</i>

364
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:36,343
- Hello again. - Hello. I was
just practicing lying here.

365
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,417
I brought you something
to help you relax.

366
00:24:38,586 --> 00:24:41,054
- What for?
- What for?

367
00:24:41,222 --> 00:24:43,282
The fall? I'm all right, I'm just angry.

368
00:24:43,459 --> 00:24:46,827
I don't blame you. I'm changing the nurse.
She's not experienced enough...

369
00:24:46,996 --> 00:24:48,726
- Don't do that.
- Why not?

370
00:24:48,899 --> 00:24:51,528
Because it wasn't her fault.
It was just an accident.

371
00:24:51,703 --> 00:24:54,695
At least I should have someone
around here I could talk to.

372
00:24:55,308 --> 00:24:57,401
Here, I think this will help you.

373
00:24:57,578 --> 00:25:02,209
- Don't do that. Don't give me that.
- Why not? Lt'll make you feel better.

374
00:25:02,383 --> 00:25:03,408
Quieter, you mean.

375
00:25:04,453 --> 00:25:05,819
Look, Mr. Harrison...

376
00:25:05,989 --> 00:25:08,458
...your body cannot handle
all this excitement.

377
00:25:08,626 --> 00:25:10,822
- Now, I think you need this.
- Why?

378
00:25:10,996 --> 00:25:13,522
- If I wanna be mad, I'll be mad.
- It's a very small...

379
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,601
If I wanna make noise,
I'll make noise.

380
00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:18,897
Just because you are upset
you can't do anything for me...

381
00:25:19,073 --> 00:25:21,804
...does not mean I'm the one
that has to get tranquilized.

382
00:25:21,977 --> 00:25:25,176
- However, it is prescribed...
- You haven't heard a word I said, have you?

383
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:27,341
Now, you listen to me, Dr. Scott.

384
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:30,920
The only thing that I have left
is my consciousness...

385
00:25:31,689 --> 00:25:33,954
...and I don't want that paralyzed
as well.

386
00:25:34,126 --> 00:25:36,152
You understand that?

387
00:25:36,329 --> 00:25:40,289
- Yeah. I hear what you're saying.
- Good. Very good.

388
00:25:40,468 --> 00:25:45,339
So if you want any tranquility,
you eat the pill.

389
00:25:47,811 --> 00:25:49,245
You want me to...?

390
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,346
Eat it.

391
00:25:52,652 --> 00:25:55,554
- We'll see.
- Good. That's what I always say.

392
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:58,955
If you're ever in doubt whether
to take a tranquilizer...

393
00:25:59,128 --> 00:26:01,359
...sleep on it.

394
00:26:01,531 --> 00:26:03,293
Okay.

395
00:26:05,602 --> 00:26:06,865
Right.

396
00:26:07,538 --> 00:26:08,801
<i>That's bullshit.</i>

397
00:26:08,974 --> 00:26:13,275
When he came here all shaken to hell,
he didn't protest the Iv saline.

398
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,244
When he was gasping for breath...

399
00:26:15,416 --> 00:26:17,647
...he didn't say,
"I don't want any Solu-Medrol. "

400
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:20,413
No, but those were inevitable
in emergency situations.

401
00:26:20,589 --> 00:26:22,717
So is this. Look, Clare...

402
00:26:22,892 --> 00:26:25,361
...we'll have to help him
to accept his condition.

403
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:28,363
Then maybe his consciousness
will be of help to him.

404
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:30,593
But how does a depressant drug
like valium...

405
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:33,398
...really help him
to accept his condition?

406
00:26:34,341 --> 00:26:37,311
Listen. Ken Harrison
is an intelligent...

407
00:26:37,478 --> 00:26:39,709
...sensitive, articulate,
wonderful person.

408
00:26:39,881 --> 00:26:41,247
Yes, he is.

409
00:26:41,417 --> 00:26:44,216
But he's not gonna prescribe
for himself.

410
00:26:44,388 --> 00:26:47,655
<i>- Will the owner of a blue Cadillac...

This is Dr. Emerson.

414
00:26:55,303 --> 00:26:58,239
I'd like you to prepare valium.
Ten milligrams, IM.

415
00:26:58,407 --> 00:26:59,635
I'll be right up.

418
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:15,792
Why are you giving my staff
such a hard time?

419
00:27:15,963 --> 00:27:17,397
Dr. Emerson, I must insist...

420
00:27:17,565 --> 00:27:20,160
...that you do not stick that needle
in my arm.

421
00:27:20,336 --> 00:27:22,066
You don't even know what's in it.

422
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:26,871
Well, I assume that it is one of
a series of measures taken...

423
00:27:27,046 --> 00:27:28,445
...to keep me alive.

424
00:27:28,614 --> 00:27:31,015
That's right. You, pal,
are a valuable life.

425
00:27:31,184 --> 00:27:32,948
I don't think so.

426
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,987
I've decided I don't
want to stay alive.

427
00:27:36,157 --> 00:27:38,855
- You can't decide that.
- Why not?

428
00:27:39,028 --> 00:27:41,429
Because you're depressed.

429
00:27:41,598 --> 00:27:43,589
Does that surprise you?

430
00:27:43,768 --> 00:27:46,738
No. In time, you'll learn to accept.
Until then, let us help you.

431
00:27:46,906 --> 00:27:49,933
Do not stick that fucking thing
in my arm.

432
00:27:53,649 --> 00:27:56,915
Goddamn you!

433
00:27:58,588 --> 00:28:01,318
I specifically refused you
permission to do that.

434
00:28:01,491 --> 00:28:03,083
It was necessary.

435
00:28:04,428 --> 00:28:06,397
Now, I want you to sleep.

436
00:28:06,565 --> 00:28:10,765
I don't wanna goddamn sleep.
I wanna goddamn think!

437
00:28:10,938 --> 00:28:12,565
When you were sculpting...

438
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,109
...and things weren't coming out right,
did you quit?

439
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:20,045
- No, I didn't.
- Well, neither do I.

440
00:28:20,217 --> 00:28:23,813
Is that what I am to you, huh?
Emerson?

441
00:28:23,988 --> 00:28:26,958
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!

442
00:28:28,495 --> 00:28:31,988
Is that all I am?
Is a lump of clay?

443
00:28:47,487 --> 00:28:49,613
Will you come on?
I told you my feet hurt.

444
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:52,385
And I've ordered three times
already. Don't forget.

445
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,357
Oh, my God.

446
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,430
My chocolates.

447
00:30:00,552 --> 00:30:02,213
You like this one?

448
00:30:02,387 --> 00:30:04,083
It's nice.

449
00:30:06,326 --> 00:30:08,955
How's this?

450
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,996
That's lovely.

451
00:30:11,967 --> 00:30:14,198
- Oh, that's it. That's it. Don't move.
- This one?

452
00:30:14,371 --> 00:30:16,236
- Well, hurry up.
- Stay there. Don't...

453
00:30:16,406 --> 00:30:19,433
Rewind. You gotta go back.

454
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,044
You like that?

455
00:30:21,213 --> 00:30:23,375
Show me the one that's two steps
after it.

456
00:30:23,549 --> 00:30:26,041
- With the elbow?
- Yeah.

457
00:30:31,293 --> 00:30:32,556
That's nice.

458
00:33:00,092 --> 00:33:02,323
- Sadler, you wanna do
some rounds? - Yes.

459
00:33:02,496 --> 00:33:04,488
Okay, let's go.

460
00:33:17,416 --> 00:33:20,647
- And good morning to you.
- Good morning.

461
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,755
Back with the sheets.

462
00:33:22,923 --> 00:33:24,983
And spread.

463
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,594
And voilà.

464
00:33:26,762 --> 00:33:29,027
The night nurse said you had
a good night's sleep.

465
00:33:29,199 --> 00:33:32,363
Well, I had some help,
if you remember, from Emerson.

466
00:33:32,537 --> 00:33:35,473
Like being hit on the head
with a soft baseball bat.

467
00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:38,835
But your eyes look
bright this morning.

468
00:33:39,013 --> 00:33:41,846
- I've been thinking.
- Ready? And...

469
00:33:42,016 --> 00:33:43,814
You do too much of that.

470
00:33:43,985 --> 00:33:47,444
What other activity would you suggest?
Jogging, perhaps?

471
00:33:47,623 --> 00:33:49,648
Hey, Rodriguez, you remember
that lawyer...

472
00:33:49,825 --> 00:33:53,729
...that came here a few months ago
from the insurance company?

473
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:57,335
- His name was something Hill?
- Yeah, I remember.

474
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:00,133
- You think you could call
him for me? - Sure.

475
00:34:00,308 --> 00:34:03,574
Since I'm gonna be around here for
some time, I think money would help.

476
00:34:03,745 --> 00:34:05,804
Good thinking in there.

477
00:34:05,981 --> 00:34:08,712
His card is in my top drawer.
You'll call him?

478
00:34:08,885 --> 00:34:10,547
Knock, knock. Hi, everybody.

479
00:34:10,721 --> 00:34:12,451
- Hi.
- Great day, huh?

480
00:34:12,624 --> 00:34:15,719
I had to park about four miles away.
Oh, you look pretty dry.

481
00:34:16,862 --> 00:34:19,458
- Would you ladies excuse us,
please? - Yes.

482
00:34:27,477 --> 00:34:29,639
I got some new music for you.

483
00:34:31,148 --> 00:34:33,242
- How are you today?
- Fine.

484
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,553
You don't seem the same.

485
00:34:37,091 --> 00:34:39,389
You come here every day.

486
00:34:40,628 --> 00:34:41,960
It's remarkable.

487
00:34:43,098 --> 00:34:45,260
What's so remarkable about it?

488
00:34:45,434 --> 00:34:48,131
- I love you.
- Oh, I know.

489
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:52,574
And I'm honored by
that and moved.

490
00:34:55,047 --> 00:34:57,516
What's wrong with you today?

491
00:34:58,351 --> 00:35:00,149
I want to ask you a question.

492
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:05,660
We make cute little jokes about
nurses and hints of sex...

493
00:35:05,828 --> 00:35:07,091
...you know?

494
00:35:07,798 --> 00:35:12,567
Now, obviously, I haven't slept
with anyone for over six months.

495
00:35:15,541 --> 00:35:17,066
Have you?

496
00:35:17,844 --> 00:35:19,210
No.

497
00:35:20,616 --> 00:35:22,174
Why not?

498
00:35:23,286 --> 00:35:26,916
Not interested in other men.
I love you.

499
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:30,858
Without self-pity,
I am no longer someone to love.

500
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:34,397
I am an object that has to be
taken care of for the rest of his life.

501
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:38,026
- I don't know why you're doing this.
- I have to be on a dialysis machine...

502
00:35:38,205 --> 00:35:41,141
...four hours a day.
- None of that matters to me.

503
00:35:41,309 --> 00:35:42,709
Matters to me.

504
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,544
Pat, I know you love me...

505
00:35:48,586 --> 00:35:52,250
...and when I was Ken Harrison,
I loved you...

506
00:35:52,425 --> 00:35:54,655
...but that was a long time ago.

507
00:35:54,829 --> 00:35:59,699
At least six months and one spine ago.
I am not the man that loved you.

508
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:03,270
Now, you have been loyal
and you have been loving...

509
00:36:03,439 --> 00:36:06,968
...and you have been self-sacrificing.

510
00:36:08,613 --> 00:36:10,479
I don't want any
part of it anymore...

511
00:36:10,649 --> 00:36:13,483
...and I want you to walk out
of here and not come back.

512
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:18,381
- Hey. - I just want you
to find a new life.

513
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:21,655
Find a man and get married
and have babies.

514
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,930
What am I to do?
Go to the Salvation Army?

515
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,592
Patty, if you were laying here...

516
00:36:26,771 --> 00:36:29,240
...and I was standing
where you are...

517
00:36:30,742 --> 00:36:32,608
...I'd leave you flat.

518
00:36:32,779 --> 00:36:35,180
You would, would you?

519
00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:37,648
I may still love you,
but I'd leave you.

520
00:36:37,819 --> 00:36:39,651
Well, you have got
a lot of balls...

521
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:43,224
...to lie there and make decisions
without me about our future.

522
00:36:46,397 --> 00:36:48,992
Everything we've ever
done together...

523
00:36:49,168 --> 00:36:51,831
...everything we've had together,
or been to each other...

524
00:36:52,005 --> 00:36:53,530
...everything you've given me...

525
00:36:53,707 --> 00:36:56,506
...that's part of me now,
and I won't give it back.

526
00:36:58,046 --> 00:36:59,446
I can't give it back.

527
00:36:59,615 --> 00:37:04,850
Do you know that every time
that you walk into this room...

528
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:07,957
...you remind me of the way
things were?

529
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:11,954
Every time I look at you...

530
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,431
...I see what I cannot do...

531
00:37:17,104 --> 00:37:19,073
...and what I will never do again.

532
00:37:20,008 --> 00:37:22,774
And I can't stand it.

533
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:31,313
I know you love me, Patty.

534
00:37:35,396 --> 00:37:39,858
But if you don't wanna torture me,
you'll go now, please.

535
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,946
Don't do that.

536
00:38:53,535 --> 00:38:56,232
You know, I always say
that if a man can't use his hands...

537
00:38:56,405 --> 00:38:59,603
...he's got to be a real dumb
son of a bitch to cry, you know?

538
00:39:01,012 --> 00:39:04,175
I mean, it's just another way
of getting your gown wet, man.

539
00:39:04,949 --> 00:39:07,977
I'm all right now, John. Thank you.

540
00:39:08,455 --> 00:39:11,323
Well, I didn't do nothing except
save meself the trouble...

541
00:39:11,492 --> 00:39:14,462
...of carrying a wet gown
all the way to the laundry.

542
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:38,526
<i>Dr. Greenberg, please call
Physical Therapy.</i>

543
00:39:38,695 --> 00:39:42,098
<i>Dr. Greenberg, please call
Physical Therapy.</i>

544
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,911
Stop it. Don't do that.

545
00:39:54,082 --> 00:39:56,347
- I can't help meself, me dear.
- Oh, God.

546
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,011
Now I have to get these
instruments sterilized again.

547
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,657
Don't say things like that.

548
00:40:00,825 --> 00:40:03,021
Just the thought of it
makes me crazy, you know.

549
00:40:03,195 --> 00:40:05,687
Everything to you here
is a big joke, isn't it?

550
00:40:05,865 --> 00:40:08,836
Can't take a place like this
too serious, you know.

551
00:40:09,004 --> 00:40:11,632
I mean, one floor people dying
of poison air and water...

552
00:40:11,807 --> 00:40:14,242
...the next floor, ladies having
belly tucks.

553
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:15,638
Clean shit.

554
00:40:15,812 --> 00:40:17,906
Well, look what they've done
for Mr. Harrison.

555
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,347
Yeah, and how much does it cost
to keep him alive?

556
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:23,489
- Thousands of dollars a week.
- That's not the point.

557
00:40:23,657 --> 00:40:25,784
Well, the point is, in Africa...

558
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,690
...people die of the measles,
you know, little babies even.

559
00:40:28,863 --> 00:40:31,025
Only cost a few pennies
to keep them alive now.

560
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,260
There's got to be something
crazy somewhere.

561
00:40:33,436 --> 00:40:35,335
- Well, that's wrong too.
- Check.

562
00:40:35,504 --> 00:40:38,771
So how about going out with me tonight?
We could discuss it some more.

563
00:40:38,943 --> 00:40:41,572
- I don't think... - Come on.
We could get something to eat.

564
00:40:41,747 --> 00:40:44,876
Later, my band is rehearsing.
It would be fun. We're sounding good.

565
00:40:45,051 --> 00:40:47,543
I have an anatomy final.
It's a real killer.

566
00:40:47,721 --> 00:40:50,783
Anatomy, is it? Well, your problems
are over, you lucky girl.

567
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,225
You see, I'm an expert on anatomy.

568
00:40:53,396 --> 00:40:55,695
I could come over and show you
the hard parts.

569
00:40:55,867 --> 00:40:58,165
- Yeah, I'll bet you could.
- John.

570
00:40:59,137 --> 00:41:03,075
- Are you out of work?
- This man in this place? Never.

571
00:41:03,243 --> 00:41:05,508
I was about to start scrubbing
the ceilings...

572
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:07,340
...don't you know?

573
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:11,081
Miss Sadler, your job is to lower
the temperature of the patients...

574
00:41:11,254 --> 00:41:13,155
...not raise the hopes
of the orderlies.

575
00:41:13,323 --> 00:41:15,087
Yes, ma'am.

576
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,928
- So who's my blind date?
- Hey, it's a real nice lady, man.

577
00:41:25,105 --> 00:41:28,735
- Don't tell me, she's lots of fun.
- It's Mrs. Boyle.

578
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:31,072
Mrs. Boyle?

579
00:41:31,246 --> 00:41:32,612
- Yeah.
- Do I have to see her?

580
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:35,013
Well, Dr. Emerson asked her
to stop by, you know.

581
00:41:35,186 --> 00:41:37,087
Well, then I will see her.
If I refuse...

582
00:41:37,255 --> 00:41:39,850
...he'll dissolve her in water
and inject her into me.

583
00:41:42,762 --> 00:41:44,321
Excuse me.

584
00:41:46,601 --> 00:41:48,967
- Mr. Harrison.
- I used to be.

585
00:41:49,138 --> 00:41:52,131
- Kate Boyle. John.
- Come to cheer me up?

586
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,175
- I wouldn't quite say that.
- No?

587
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,337
Would you like to go over
to that corner?

588
00:41:56,515 --> 00:41:57,948
- Sure.
- John?

589
00:41:58,116 --> 00:42:00,017
Anything you say.

590
00:42:00,753 --> 00:42:03,484
- How's it going, Ken?
- Pretty good. Stick around.

591
00:42:03,658 --> 00:42:05,182
This lady's gonna cheer us up.

592
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,849
We could use that around here.

593
00:42:07,027 --> 00:42:09,394
She's gonna saw us in half
or do a belly dance.

594
00:42:09,564 --> 00:42:11,430
Not exactly.

595
00:42:12,201 --> 00:42:15,535
- Well, if that's not what you do...
- If you need me, I'll be over there.

596
00:42:15,706 --> 00:42:19,144
...what exactly do you do, Mrs. Boyle?

597
00:42:19,945 --> 00:42:23,212
- Come to see if I can help you.
- Really?

598
00:42:23,384 --> 00:42:26,616
There is a rumor going around that
you don't want any more treatment.

599
00:42:26,788 --> 00:42:28,756
- Good.
- Why good?

600
00:42:28,924 --> 00:42:31,655
Because I didn't think
anyone around here heard me.

601
00:42:31,828 --> 00:42:34,229
I heard you, and that is why
I want to know...

602
00:42:34,398 --> 00:42:36,367
...why you don't want
any more treatment.

603
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:40,197
Because I don't want to go on
living like this.

604
00:42:40,374 --> 00:42:43,867
Why not? I mean,
it's a lousy break...

605
00:42:44,045 --> 00:42:47,642
...but you'll be surprised at the things
you'll be able to do with training...

606
00:42:47,817 --> 00:42:49,785
...and a little patience.
- Such as?

607
00:42:49,953 --> 00:42:52,387
You're gonna be able to operate
a reading machine...

608
00:42:52,556 --> 00:42:56,652
...and I think, an adapted typewriter,
maybe even a calculator.

609
00:42:56,827 --> 00:43:00,629
Gee and wow. The three R's.

610
00:43:02,001 --> 00:43:05,029
Doesn't exactly make for
an abundant life, does it?

611
00:43:05,206 --> 00:43:09,439
<i>Do you realize that Monet was almost
blind when he painted the Water Lilies?</i>

612
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:14,982
And that Renoir's hands were so crippled,
they had to tie brushes for him to paint?

613
00:43:15,153 --> 00:43:17,349
- And that...?
- No, no, no. Don't go on, please.

614
00:43:17,523 --> 00:43:20,118
Please don't go on. I know,
you're going to read to me...

615
00:43:20,293 --> 00:43:23,195
<i>...from the Reader's Digest
"My Most Unforgettable Lame. "</i>

616
00:43:23,364 --> 00:43:26,927
You're an artist.
Sculpting isn't the only art.

617
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:30,938
Have you ever thought about
dictating into a tape recorder?

618
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:34,204
You could write a book about sculpture,
a novel, poetry.

619
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,779
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

620
00:43:35,948 --> 00:43:39,385
Do you think you change your art
like you switch your major in college?

621
00:43:39,553 --> 00:43:44,185
I'm a sculptor. My whole being,
my entire imagination...

622
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,156
...speaks to me through...

623
00:43:51,302 --> 00:43:55,171
Spoke to me through my fingers.

624
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,335
I was a sculptor.

625
00:43:59,513 --> 00:44:02,949
And that was what
my life was all about.

626
00:44:03,117 --> 00:44:05,245
Now, you people seem to think...

627
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:08,323
...that it's about survival,
no matter what.

628
00:44:08,825 --> 00:44:12,626
Now, if I'd wanted to write
a goddamn novel, I would've done it.

629
00:44:12,797 --> 00:44:15,893
If I'd wanted to dictate poetry,
I would've done that.

630
00:44:16,069 --> 00:44:18,664
How do you know you won't
wanna do that unless you try?

631
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:21,434
Because trying isn't important.

632
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:23,441
The work is important.

633
00:44:24,446 --> 00:44:25,675
The work.

634
00:44:25,848 --> 00:44:29,649
And not the credit and not the...
The reward.

635
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,812
And it is the work...

636
00:44:32,457 --> 00:44:34,688
...that I will never do again.

637
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:37,454
How do you know you won't find
new work?

638
00:44:37,631 --> 00:44:39,758
Look, just give it a chance.

639
00:44:39,933 --> 00:44:41,902
Let me bring the reading
machine tomorrow.

640
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:43,971
One try. You might
surprise yourself.

641
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:46,369
Are there many books
for that machine?

642
00:44:46,542 --> 00:44:48,067
Yeah. Quite a few.

643
00:44:48,244 --> 00:44:51,009
You think I could make a request
for the first one?

644
00:44:51,182 --> 00:44:52,548
Anything.

645
00:44:52,717 --> 00:44:54,446
How about...

646
00:44:55,188 --> 00:44:58,249
<i>...Sculpting With No Hands,
Self-Taught?</i>

647
00:45:01,329 --> 00:45:03,662
Okay. You win.

648
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:06,701
I can see that you are not ready
for this discussion...

649
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:10,671
...so I will just come
back when you are.

650
00:45:12,945 --> 00:45:14,675
You know, you are amazing,
you know?

651
00:45:14,848 --> 00:45:17,044
All you goddamn people
are the same.

652
00:45:17,218 --> 00:45:21,315
Every single time that I say something
even a little bit awkward...

653
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:23,857
...you just pretend I haven't said
anything at all.

654
00:45:24,027 --> 00:45:25,994
It's amazing.

655
00:45:26,162 --> 00:45:29,497
Why can't you try to relate to
your patients like human beings?

656
00:45:29,667 --> 00:45:33,159
You know what's happening?
You're getting very angry.

657
00:45:33,338 --> 00:45:37,470
- I can understand your anger...
- Oh, Jesus. You're doing it again.

658
00:45:37,644 --> 00:45:38,942
Just listen to yourself.

659
00:45:39,113 --> 00:45:41,275
I've just said something offensive
about you...

660
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:44,284
...and you have turned
your professional cheek.

661
00:45:45,121 --> 00:45:47,750
If you were a human being...

662
00:45:47,925 --> 00:45:50,919
...or if you were treating me
like a human being...

663
00:45:52,064 --> 00:45:55,090
...you would've told
me to screw off.

664
00:45:55,936 --> 00:46:00,431
Now, can you understand that is why
I don't wanna go on living?

665
00:46:00,608 --> 00:46:03,807
And I am more convinced
of that now...

666
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:07,610
...after your visit, than I was before.
How do you like them apples?

667
00:46:07,919 --> 00:46:13,417
The very exercise of your so-called
professionalism makes me want to die.

668
00:46:18,265 --> 00:46:19,289
What's happening?

669
00:46:19,466 --> 00:46:21,196
- I can't breathe.
- Okay, what's wrong?

670
00:46:21,369 --> 00:46:23,167
Just go away, please. John.

671
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:27,071
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Please, just relax. - John.

672
00:46:27,244 --> 00:46:29,406
Is there a nurse?
Is there a nurse, please?

673
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:31,049
I'm sorry.

674
00:46:31,217 --> 00:46:32,617
Is there a nurse here, please?

675
00:46:32,786 --> 00:46:34,117
Relax. Watch out, Mrs. Boyle.

676
00:46:34,287 --> 00:46:36,950
Let the nurse take care of it.
It happens all the time.

677
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:40,722
Watch out! Relax, man.
Relax your body.

678
00:46:40,896 --> 00:46:43,365
Get the hell out of the way!
Back! Nurse Rodriguez!

679
00:46:43,566 --> 00:46:46,297
Nurse Rodriguez,
he can't breathe now!

680
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,530
- Call Dr. Scott.
- He can't breathe, man!

681
00:46:49,742 --> 00:46:52,007
You'll be all right, John.

682
00:46:52,913 --> 00:46:54,506
- Open your mouth.
- All right.

683
00:46:54,682 --> 00:46:57,379
- Come on. Come on.
- Jesus Christ, fix him now.

684
00:46:57,553 --> 00:46:58,781
Hold him, John. Hold him.

685
00:46:58,954 --> 00:47:00,786
- Hold your head.
- Hold him.

686
00:47:00,957 --> 00:47:03,188
Breathe in. Breathe in.

687
00:47:03,361 --> 00:47:07,263
- Just take it in.
- Okay, just relax. Relax.

688
00:47:08,332 --> 00:47:11,599
- He's gonna be all right, yeah?
- Relax. Okay, yeah. He'll be all right.

689
00:47:11,771 --> 00:47:13,762
- He's going to be all right. Okay.
- Okay.

690
00:47:13,941 --> 00:47:17,503
Feel okay? Yeah?
Yeah. Yeah, he feels okay.

691
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:19,511
Just get him on the bed.

692
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:29,424
Hey, man's in bed with his wife,
you know.

693
00:47:29,595 --> 00:47:31,086
Turns to the lady and says:

694
00:47:31,264 --> 00:47:34,200
"Why don't you never let me know
when you're having an orgasm?"

695
00:47:34,368 --> 00:47:37,861
She looks over at him and says:
"Darling, it's because you're never there. "

696
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,770
Two, three.

697
00:47:42,379 --> 00:47:45,144
- I think you got a smile, John.
- Yeah.

698
00:47:45,317 --> 00:47:50,153
- You got a smile. I hear a laugh.
- "It's because you're never there. "

699
00:47:50,323 --> 00:47:54,055
- One and...
- Yeah. Yeah.

700
00:47:54,227 --> 00:47:59,428
All right. This hospital will
kill no quad before its time.

701
00:47:59,735 --> 00:48:00,828
I called Mr. Hill.

702
00:48:01,004 --> 00:48:03,940
He said he'd be here tomorrow.
Didn't know exactly when.

703
00:48:04,108 --> 00:48:05,906
Well, I'll be in all day.

704
00:48:06,078 --> 00:48:07,375
Is everything okay in here?

705
00:48:07,546 --> 00:48:10,483
- This must be Grand Central Station.
- Is there any obstruction?

706
00:48:10,651 --> 00:48:12,778
No, just a spasm. He'll be fine.

707
00:48:13,787 --> 00:48:15,653
- Hello there.
- Hi.

708
00:48:15,824 --> 00:48:17,291
Is your breathing okay now?

709
00:48:18,194 --> 00:48:19,958
What was all the fuss about?

710
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:23,233
I had a run-in with Mrs. Boyle.

711
00:48:24,168 --> 00:48:28,539
I know I should've just smiled
and nodded.

712
00:48:28,708 --> 00:48:32,168
The last thing I wanna do is to
get Emerson down here again...

713
00:48:32,347 --> 00:48:34,440
...with his pharmaceutical nightstick.

714
00:48:34,617 --> 00:48:36,311
Yeah. I'm sorry about that.

715
00:48:36,485 --> 00:48:39,011
Well, I don't suppose
it was your fault.

716
00:48:39,188 --> 00:48:42,023
- I'll be on the floor if you need me.
- All right. Thanks.

717
00:48:43,628 --> 00:48:45,459
Mr. Harrison...

718
00:48:46,197 --> 00:48:49,293
...do you think perhaps
I could give you some advice?

719
00:48:52,173 --> 00:48:53,800
Why don't you take the pills?

720
00:48:53,975 --> 00:48:56,673
The dose is so small,
it's like taking nothing.

721
00:48:56,846 --> 00:49:00,338
They're not gonna dull your consciousness,
not like the injection will.

722
00:49:01,017 --> 00:49:03,077
You have beautiful breasts.

723
00:49:08,161 --> 00:49:14,125
- What did you say?
- I said, you have beautiful breasts.

724
00:49:19,076 --> 00:49:20,543
What an odd thing to say.

725
00:49:20,711 --> 00:49:23,545
Why? I know you're a doctor,
but you're not gonna tell me...

726
00:49:23,715 --> 00:49:26,150
...that you only regard them
as mammary glands.

727
00:49:26,453 --> 00:49:28,888
- No. I know.
- You're perfectly safe.

728
00:49:29,056 --> 00:49:31,116
I'm not gonna jump out of bed
and rape you.

729
00:49:31,293 --> 00:49:32,521
- Yeah.
- Did I embarrass you?

730
00:49:32,694 --> 00:49:34,753
No, you didn't embarrass me.

731
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:38,060
- You just surprised me a little bit.
- And embarrassed you.

732
00:49:38,235 --> 00:49:41,330
- Yeah, just a little.
- Why?

733
00:49:42,006 --> 00:49:45,568
I admit it's unusual for a man to
compliment a woman on her breasts...

734
00:49:45,744 --> 00:49:48,270
...when only one of them is in bed.

735
00:49:49,816 --> 00:49:51,307
One of the people, that is.

736
00:49:51,486 --> 00:49:54,479
- Not one of the breasts. No.
- Not one of...?

737
00:49:54,656 --> 00:49:57,957
That...? It's not the reason,
is it?

738
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:02,031
Look, I... I don't really think this is
helping you to talk like this, do you?

739
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,966
Because I can't do anything
about it, you mean.

740
00:50:05,138 --> 00:50:07,504
Well, yeah. Right.

741
00:50:08,575 --> 00:50:11,477
You know, I've noticed you
walking around this room...

742
00:50:11,646 --> 00:50:15,243
...bending over me, examining
my body. It's amazing.

743
00:50:15,585 --> 00:50:17,520
It's amazing how relaxed
a woman can be...

744
00:50:17,688 --> 00:50:20,681
...when she's not in the presence
of a man.

745
00:50:23,795 --> 00:50:25,388
Yeah.

746
00:50:26,699 --> 00:50:29,965
Look, I'm sorry.

747
00:50:30,804 --> 00:50:33,273
I mean, I'm sorry if I have provoked
you in any way...

748
00:50:33,441 --> 00:50:35,603
...because, believe me,
it was not intentional.

749
00:50:35,778 --> 00:50:38,009
No, no. You haven't provoked me,
as you call it.

750
00:50:38,181 --> 00:50:40,275
But you are a woman.

751
00:50:40,451 --> 00:50:44,446
And even though I only have a piece
of knotted string between my legs...

752
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:47,617
...I still have a man's mind.

753
00:50:48,529 --> 00:50:51,294
Now, the other things I've noticed
is that I now engage...

754
00:50:51,467 --> 00:50:53,593
...in sexual banter
with young nurses.

755
00:50:53,769 --> 00:50:56,797
I'm constantly searching
for the double-entendre...

756
00:50:56,974 --> 00:50:59,273
...in the most innocent of remarks.

757
00:51:00,045 --> 00:51:04,313
Every time they leave the room,
I just go cold with embarrassment.

758
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:09,088
- Is that disgusting?
- No.

759
00:51:11,628 --> 00:51:14,222
- Pathetic?
- It's sad.

760
00:51:18,769 --> 00:51:21,466
I'm serious, you know,
about wanting to die.

761
00:51:22,207 --> 00:51:24,301
Ken, come on.

762
00:51:24,477 --> 00:51:26,605
Believe me,
you'll get over this feeling.

763
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:28,806
- How do you know?
- I know from experience...

764
00:51:28,984 --> 00:51:32,216
...from watching other patients
who are worse off than you are...

765
00:51:32,388 --> 00:51:35,848
...who go through the same thing.
- We all respond the same? We vegetables?

766
00:51:36,027 --> 00:51:39,224
It's probably very difficult for you
to know what you want right now.

767
00:51:39,397 --> 00:51:42,561
Well, Dr. Scott, I do,
with a free and working mind...

768
00:51:42,736 --> 00:51:45,501
...and it is your moral obligation
to accept my decision.

769
00:51:45,673 --> 00:51:47,801
No. Wait a minute.
Not according to my morals.

770
00:51:47,976 --> 00:51:51,913
Why? Why are yours better than mine?
I'll tell you why.

771
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:57,144
Because you're more powerful than me.
I am in your power.

772
00:52:03,362 --> 00:52:08,597
Well, I think you should try
to get some sleep now.

773
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:12,105
You've had a tough day.
I'm afraid I have to get going.

774
00:52:12,275 --> 00:52:14,402
I was just in the middle
of another patient.

775
00:52:14,578 --> 00:52:17,309
Oh, I thought you
were just passing through.

776
00:52:19,284 --> 00:52:21,651
- Dr. Scott.
- Yeah.

777
00:52:21,822 --> 00:52:23,346
You still have beautiful breasts.

778
00:52:29,932 --> 00:52:32,265
Well, thank you.

779
00:52:54,631 --> 00:52:57,965
That's it. That's it. Let's go.
Come on.

780
00:52:58,136 --> 00:53:01,073
Good. Way to fire it.
Playmaker, let's go.

781
00:53:01,241 --> 00:53:03,038
All right, good.

782
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:05,202
That's in, that's in, that's in.

783
00:53:06,815 --> 00:53:08,146
Mr. Hill.

784
00:53:10,519 --> 00:53:12,044
- How are you?
- Oh, I'm better.

785
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:13,781
I had a terrible cold last week.

786
00:53:13,958 --> 00:53:16,325
I was, you know,
flat on my back for...

787
00:53:16,495 --> 00:53:18,293
You know, I couldn't move...

788
00:53:21,435 --> 00:53:24,132
You know, those guys are very good,
just like a real team.

789
00:53:24,305 --> 00:53:25,864
No, their dribbling sucks.

790
00:53:26,041 --> 00:53:29,011
Well, I've got all the
papers here, and...

791
00:53:29,179 --> 00:53:30,977
I don't wanna talk about
the accident.

792
00:53:31,149 --> 00:53:34,915
I can understand that, Mr. Harrison,
but I'm afraid that we really must.

793
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:36,349
No, no, no, I don't wanna...

794
00:53:36,522 --> 00:53:39,356
I didn't ask you to come here
because of the insurance claim.

795
00:53:39,526 --> 00:53:43,054
Mr. Hill, do you think you could
wheel me over to that table?

796
00:53:43,864 --> 00:53:45,560
Thank you.

797
00:53:48,838 --> 00:53:52,776
You have to undo the brake
under my right elbow.

798
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:57,180
Okay.

799
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:00,980
Let me ask you a question.

800
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:03,953
You don't work exclusively
for the insurance company, do you?

801
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:07,119
No. I'm with a... A small firm.

802
00:54:07,297 --> 00:54:10,267
So there's no reason why you couldn't
represent me independently?

803
00:54:10,434 --> 00:54:11,925
No. Is this all right?

804
00:54:12,103 --> 00:54:14,800
- That's just fine. Thank you.
- All right.

805
00:54:14,974 --> 00:54:17,671
I'd like you to do something
for me, if possible.

806
00:54:17,845 --> 00:54:19,403
All right.

807
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:22,015
I'd like you to get me
the hell out of here.

808
00:54:23,418 --> 00:54:26,320
Well, I'm afraid I don't understand
what you mean.

809
00:54:26,489 --> 00:54:30,790
It's really very simple. I'd like to be
discharged from this hospital.

810
00:54:30,962 --> 00:54:33,487
- To another hospital?
- No.

811
00:54:36,202 --> 00:54:40,606
Well, they wouldn't keep you here
any longer than necessary.

812
00:54:40,774 --> 00:54:42,469
You wouldn't think so, would you?

813
00:54:43,712 --> 00:54:46,307
Mr. Hill, I can't exist
outside this hospital.

814
00:54:46,482 --> 00:54:49,816
They have to keep me here
in order to keep me alive.

815
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:53,583
And they do seem rather intent
upon doing just that.

816
00:54:54,226 --> 00:54:58,221
But I have decided that I do not
wish to go on living like this...

817
00:54:58,399 --> 00:55:02,063
...and so I would like to be discharged
so that I could die.

818
00:55:03,973 --> 00:55:07,101
And you want me
to represent you?

819
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:09,210
Tough luck.

820
00:55:12,785 --> 00:55:13,945
Astonishing request.

821
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,986
My sculpture isn't very
orthodox either.

822
00:55:16,156 --> 00:55:18,182
You mean,
just lie there somewhere...

823
00:55:18,359 --> 00:55:20,020
...and die?
- And die, yes.

824
00:55:20,195 --> 00:55:23,460
- Well, what's the hospital say?
- They don't know about it yet.

825
00:55:23,632 --> 00:55:27,729
But do you realize
what you're asking me...?

826
00:55:27,904 --> 00:55:30,999
I do realize that I am not asking you
to make any decision...

827
00:55:31,175 --> 00:55:33,076
...concerning my life and death.

828
00:55:33,245 --> 00:55:36,977
I am only asking you to represent
my position to this hospital.

829
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:38,914
Now, lawyers,
as a matter of course...

830
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:42,580
...represent criminals who they
know to be guilty, don't they?

831
00:55:42,758 --> 00:55:43,747
Yeah.

832
00:55:43,926 --> 00:55:45,087
So...

833
00:55:45,262 --> 00:55:48,289
...don't you think I have the same
rights as any ax murderer?

834
00:55:50,202 --> 00:55:51,863
Mary Jo! Wait!

835
00:55:52,037 --> 00:55:53,766
She's such a lovely girl, you know.

836
00:55:53,939 --> 00:55:55,965
We'll go for a little extra ride,
Mr. Forman.

837
00:55:56,142 --> 00:55:57,735
I'm going to Gynecology.

838
00:55:57,911 --> 00:56:00,642
Gynecology. He'll love it.

839
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:02,647
Where are you going?

840
00:56:03,986 --> 00:56:05,579
Now, why won't you
go out with me?

841
00:56:05,756 --> 00:56:07,088
Oh, God. I can't.

842
00:56:07,258 --> 00:56:09,659
You know, negative thinking
never got nobody nowhere.

843
00:56:09,828 --> 00:56:11,659
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm busy.

844
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:13,161
Besides, I hardly know you.

845
00:56:13,332 --> 00:56:15,857
Right. That's why I think
we ought to go out, you know.

846
00:56:16,035 --> 00:56:17,128
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

847
00:56:17,303 --> 00:56:19,431
- Well, ask me next week.
- Next week?

848
00:56:19,607 --> 00:56:21,576
Yeah. After exams, okay?

849
00:56:21,743 --> 00:56:23,438
Okay, it's a deal.

850
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:26,640
And I'll ask you this
afternoon as well.

851
00:56:28,787 --> 00:56:30,220
Now, wasn't that fun?

852
00:56:30,388 --> 00:56:31,822
You want me to kill my patient?

853
00:56:31,991 --> 00:56:35,519
No. I'm simply presenting
Mr. Harrison's...

854
00:56:35,695 --> 00:56:38,220
...wishes in the matter.
- Would you sign this, please?

855
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:40,424
But you do represent
Harrison in this matter?

856
00:56:40,601 --> 00:56:45,370
No, I told him I had to talk to you
before I made that decision.

857
00:56:45,542 --> 00:56:48,342
Releasing Harrison to anything
but a full-service hospital...

858
00:56:48,513 --> 00:56:51,608
...is tantamount to murder.
- No, murder's a legal term.

859
00:56:52,585 --> 00:56:54,076
Murder's a legal term, doctor.

860
00:56:54,254 --> 00:56:58,283
I'm merely representing
my client's needs and wishes...

861
00:56:58,461 --> 00:57:00,292
...if I choose to represent him.

862
00:57:00,463 --> 00:57:03,364
- You believe in capital punishment.
- Oh, come on.

863
00:57:03,532 --> 00:57:06,661
- That's what you're recommending
here. - No, I'm not.

864
00:57:06,837 --> 00:57:09,136
I'm not recommending anything yet.

865
00:57:09,307 --> 00:57:10,741
Yet? Look, Mr. Hill.

866
00:57:10,909 --> 00:57:14,311
We've spent six months and a lot of
money trying to save this man's life.

867
00:57:14,481 --> 00:57:17,452
Good morning. We're not gonna
throw that down the drain.

868
00:57:17,619 --> 00:57:19,018
That is not the issue, doctor.

869
00:57:19,187 --> 00:57:22,282
We're talking about a man's right
to determine his life...

870
00:57:22,458 --> 00:57:24,619
...not the quality or expense
of your treatment.

871
00:57:24,795 --> 00:57:29,256
Mr. Harrison would like to be discharged
from this hospital.

872
00:57:29,434 --> 00:57:30,959
- Will you do that?
- No.

873
00:57:31,137 --> 00:57:32,127
Why not?

874
00:57:32,305 --> 00:57:35,275
Because it's my sworn duty
to preserve life, not to destroy it.

875
00:57:35,443 --> 00:57:38,140
I'm not gonna let this man die
through any legal chicanery.

876
00:57:38,313 --> 00:57:41,147
- He is a voluntary patient here.
- This interview is at an end.

877
00:57:41,317 --> 00:57:45,914
I do not see any legal basis for you
to hold him here against his wishes.

878
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:48,719
Just try to understand one thing.

879
00:57:49,195 --> 00:57:52,653
Mr. Harrison is not capable
of making any rational decision...

880
00:57:52,832 --> 00:57:54,562
...about his life or his death.

881
00:57:54,735 --> 00:57:56,795
He's in a state of depression...

882
00:57:56,971 --> 00:58:00,169
...and using his situation
for your personal gain...

883
00:58:00,342 --> 00:58:02,004
...is the lowest form of banality.

884
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:04,876
In your opinion, then, Mr. Harrison
is mentally unbalanced?

885
00:58:05,049 --> 00:58:06,642
- Correct.
- In my opinion he is not.

886
00:58:06,818 --> 00:58:09,651
Jesus Christ! You're not a doctor.

887
00:58:09,821 --> 00:58:12,950
Well, would you object to my bringing in
a qualified psychiatrist...

888
00:58:13,126 --> 00:58:15,186
...who would examine Mr. Harrison?

889
00:58:15,563 --> 00:58:18,728
We have several on staff who would
be happy to examine Mr. Harrison.

890
00:58:18,901 --> 00:58:21,564
I'm sure you'll understand
if I ask my own psychiatrist...

891
00:58:21,738 --> 00:58:24,902
...whose opinion you are not
so sure of in advance.

892
00:58:28,147 --> 00:58:29,706
Goodbye, Mr. Hill.

893
00:58:30,417 --> 00:58:33,079
Well, thank you for your time, doctor.

894
00:58:34,188 --> 00:58:36,089
<i>Four, five...</i>

895
00:58:36,258 --> 00:58:39,057
You weren't in the SS when you
were a kid, were you, Michael?

896
00:58:39,229 --> 00:58:41,459
- Come on, you're doing great.
- I'm doing great.

897
00:58:41,631 --> 00:58:43,862
- Come on.
- There we go.

898
00:58:46,738 --> 00:58:49,037
- Gently, gently, gently.
- Hello.

899
00:58:49,208 --> 00:58:51,143
- Hello again.
- Hello, hello, hello.

900
00:58:51,311 --> 00:58:53,439
- Hey, did you find anything out?
- Quite a bit.

901
00:58:57,753 --> 00:58:59,584
See if you can find Dr. Jacobs.

902
00:58:59,755 --> 00:59:01,747
Ask him to call me.

903
00:59:01,925 --> 00:59:04,862
And get me the hospital
administrator, stat.

904
00:59:06,098 --> 00:59:09,500
Dr. Emerson does not feel that you are
in a healthy enough mental state...

905
00:59:09,669 --> 00:59:16,619
...to make a rational decision, especially
one of this seriousness and finality.

906
00:59:16,654 --> 00:59:19,579
Now, I'm not qualified to decide
whether or not he's right.

907
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:21,217
Well, what will help you decide?

908
00:59:21,385 --> 00:59:24,219
I'd like to have you examined
by an independent psychiatrist...

909
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:27,622
- That's fine.
- I will accept his view of the case.

910
00:59:27,794 --> 00:59:29,956
- Fine. Has Emerson agreed?
- Yes. He already has.

911
00:59:30,131 --> 00:59:31,894
That's great.
That's a good beginning.

912
00:59:32,066 --> 00:59:35,195
Probably, he'll want the hospital
psychiatrist to examine you too.

913
00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:37,965
I imagine you'll end up
with two conflicting views.

914
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:39,131
I would imagine so.

915
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:42,336
- And where would that lead us, exactly?
- Well, that's hard to say.

916
00:59:42,513 --> 00:59:43,673
Emerson was very adamant.

917
00:59:43,847 --> 00:59:46,374
He'll probably use
the Mental Hygiene Law.

918
00:59:46,552 --> 00:59:49,522
Now, that means that if he can
get two psychiatrists...

919
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:52,353
...to sign statements saying
you're mentally unbalanced...

920
00:59:52,527 --> 00:59:57,432
...he can commit you here and
give you any treatment he wants.

921
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:58,590
Can he do that?

922
01:00:01,005 --> 01:00:02,200
And I have no say in that?

923
01:00:02,374 --> 01:00:06,243
Some. You can then request a hearing
and see how it goes from there.

924
01:00:08,047 --> 01:00:10,950
Well, let's get this show
on the road, okay?

925
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:13,588
Let's wheel in your shrink, all right?

926
01:00:14,457 --> 01:00:16,756
<i>Dr. Jacobs,
please call extension three.</i>

927
01:00:16,927 --> 01:00:18,589
Now, are you going
to represent me?

928
01:00:18,763 --> 01:00:22,597
I don't know. I'd like to get
the shrink in here first.

929
01:00:24,002 --> 01:00:24,991
I'll be in touch.

930
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:28,331
Okay. Well, call him
11:00 on Wednesday.

931
01:00:28,508 --> 01:00:31,376
- Oh, Sandy, thanks for sparing
the time. - Never too busy.

932
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:33,446
How do you feel?
You want a cup of coffee?

933
01:00:33,615 --> 01:00:35,516
No, thanks.
Just keeps my heartburn awake.

934
01:00:35,685 --> 01:00:37,016
Who's your problem?

935
01:00:37,186 --> 01:00:39,018
I have a 32-year-old man.

936
01:00:39,189 --> 01:00:41,886
Auto accident, severe trauma...

937
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:47,865
...C4 transect, nephrectomy,
dialysis, usual C4 comps.

938
01:00:48,302 --> 01:00:52,329
He wants to be discharged,
to go off dialysis to go home and die.

939
01:00:52,508 --> 01:00:53,497
Would he?

940
01:00:53,675 --> 01:00:55,906
Without dialysis he'd
be dead in a week.

941
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:58,412
I gave him steroids,
I balanced his electrolytes...

942
01:00:58,582 --> 01:01:00,517
...I stabilized his dialysis.

943
01:01:00,685 --> 01:01:03,553
We just about have
a viable human being again.

944
01:01:03,723 --> 01:01:06,522
Clare. Sandy Jacobs, Clare Scott.

945
01:01:06,693 --> 01:01:08,218
- Good to see you, Sandy.
- You too.

946
01:01:08,396 --> 01:01:10,921
I was just telling Dr. Jacobs
about Ken Harrison.

947
01:01:11,099 --> 01:01:12,726
- What about him?
- He's got a lawyer.

948
01:01:12,901 --> 01:01:15,803
Threatens to sue
unless we discharge him.

949
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:17,905
If I'm gonna keep him alive...

950
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:20,236
...we'll have to commit him
under Mental Health.

951
01:01:20,411 --> 01:01:24,281
Okay, even if I agree,
you're still gonna need another consult.

952
01:01:24,451 --> 01:01:25,884
That's no problem, is it?

953
01:01:26,052 --> 01:01:28,419
Depends if he's
clinically depressed, right?

954
01:01:28,589 --> 01:01:32,550
Look, if I walk in, he says,
"Hey, I'm a teapot," you're in.

955
01:01:32,728 --> 01:01:35,390
Depressed? What the hell do you mean?
He's suicidal.

956
01:01:35,565 --> 01:01:37,591
I can name
several prominent psychiatrists...

957
01:01:37,768 --> 01:01:40,135
...who wouldn't accept suicide
as evidence of insanity.

958
01:01:40,305 --> 01:01:42,536
And I can name
several prominent psychiatrists...

959
01:01:42,708 --> 01:01:44,802
...who in themselves
are evidence of insanity.

960
01:01:47,248 --> 01:01:48,716
I'll accept that.

961
01:01:48,884 --> 01:01:50,852
Okay, I will talk to
your suicide for you.

962
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:53,717
Good. And do me a favor
for the second signature.

963
01:01:53,891 --> 01:01:57,622
Try to find an old bastard like me who
believes in something better than suicide.

964
01:01:57,795 --> 01:02:00,788
I will... Listen, there is
an old bastard at St. Joseph's.

965
01:02:00,966 --> 01:02:02,228
Staunch Catholic.

966
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,335
Thanks, Sandy. I appreciate it.

967
01:02:04,504 --> 01:02:06,405
So will Harrison when he realizes.

968
01:02:06,573 --> 01:02:09,042
Right. Doctor.

969
01:02:10,445 --> 01:02:15,476
So you're committing Ken Harrison
as mentally incompetent?

970
01:02:15,653 --> 01:02:17,018
I don't believe this, Michael.

971
01:02:17,188 --> 01:02:18,713
- I know it stinks.
- Yeah.

972
01:02:18,891 --> 01:02:20,688
But he'd be dead in
a week if we don't.

973
01:02:20,859 --> 01:02:22,794
I don't understand this.
Wait a minute.

974
01:02:22,962 --> 01:02:25,932
Where do we get the right to commit him?
Isn't this his decision?

975
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:30,095
- Aren't we talking about his life here?
- But goddamn it, it's our responsibility.

976
01:02:30,273 --> 01:02:32,241
Now, I can't accept
the fact that a man...

977
01:02:32,408 --> 01:02:34,741
...of Harrison's intelligence
would choose suicide.

978
01:02:34,912 --> 01:02:37,313
I know what you mean, Michael,
but apparently he has.

979
01:02:37,483 --> 01:02:39,041
Therefore, I say he's unbalanced.

980
01:02:39,218 --> 01:02:42,781
Just because we don't agree with his
choice, doesn't make him crazy, does it?

981
01:02:42,957 --> 01:02:44,446
I mean, look at him.

982
01:02:44,624 --> 01:02:46,752
Does he look crazy to you, Michael?

983
01:02:46,928 --> 01:02:49,056
Look at him lying there. Come on.

984
01:02:49,231 --> 01:02:54,169
I mean, Christ, he's got no privacy at all,
he's got no sense of dignity.

985
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:58,908
I'll tell you, if that happened to me,
I don't know if I'd have the courage to live.

986
01:02:59,077 --> 01:03:02,810
How about you? Can you stop
playing doctor for one second and tell me...

987
01:03:02,983 --> 01:03:06,180
...would you wanna live like that?
- Don't give me that right-to-die routine.

988
01:03:06,353 --> 01:03:09,620
- We're doctors. We're committed to life.
- Don't lecture me, all right?

989
01:03:09,792 --> 01:03:12,057
When a patient is brought here
in his condition...

990
01:03:12,228 --> 01:03:15,198
...I don't stand around wondering
whether his life is worthwhile.

991
01:03:15,366 --> 01:03:17,562
I don't have time for that.
I try to save it.

992
01:03:17,736 --> 01:03:21,435
- I'm a physician, not a judge.
- Interesting. You're behaving like a judge.

993
01:03:21,609 --> 01:03:23,372
Clare. Clare.

994
01:03:24,713 --> 01:03:27,376
I'm sure it's not necessary
for me to say this...

995
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:32,386
...but if Harrison should suddenly sour
and die on us I'll order an autopsy...

996
01:03:32,556 --> 01:03:34,218
...and I'll act on whatever's found.

997
01:03:36,528 --> 01:03:37,927
You fucker.

998
01:03:42,035 --> 01:03:43,435
Here we go, off to dialysis.

999
01:03:43,604 --> 01:03:45,469
Oh, dialysis.

1000
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:47,506
Why don't we go to a bar?

1001
01:03:47,676 --> 01:03:48,871
Skip the damn dialysis.

1002
01:03:49,045 --> 01:03:50,512
Hey, come on, now.
Come on, man.

1003
01:03:50,681 --> 01:03:53,241
You know I can't do that.
I need this job.

1004
01:03:53,417 --> 01:03:55,579
This job's gonna pay
for me xylophone, you know?

1005
01:03:55,754 --> 01:03:57,346
- Yeah?
- Band sounds good, you know.

1006
01:03:57,522 --> 01:03:58,854
We can make a record even.

1007
01:03:59,025 --> 01:04:00,014
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1008
01:04:00,192 --> 01:04:01,182
Listen:

1009
01:04:01,361 --> 01:04:03,660
Hello, baby.

1010
01:04:03,831 --> 01:04:06,266
Hello, old man.

1011
01:04:06,702 --> 01:04:08,864
Old man?

1012
01:04:11,475 --> 01:04:13,671
Good morning, Roberta.

1013
01:04:13,845 --> 01:04:18,715
Lissa, anybody ever tell you that
you are absolutely gorgeous?

1014
01:04:18,885 --> 01:04:20,285
Got your hair cut, didn't you?

1015
01:04:20,454 --> 01:04:21,785
I'm not gorgeous.

1016
01:04:21,955 --> 01:04:23,048
I have a mirror.

1017
01:04:23,725 --> 01:04:25,318
And?

1018
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:26,853
I'm not gorgeous.

1019
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:28,861
Mirrors speak with forked tongue.

1020
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:30,795
Harrison speaks the truth.

1021
01:04:32,102 --> 01:04:33,092
- Guess what.
- What?

1022
01:04:33,271 --> 01:04:35,103
I'm being cut down to once a week.

1023
01:04:35,274 --> 01:04:36,935
You're kidding. That's great!

1024
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:38,906
Oh, Lissa, that's fabulous.

1025
01:04:40,213 --> 01:04:42,205
- You know what that means,
don't you? - What?

1026
01:04:42,383 --> 01:04:45,649
That means that soon you're gonna
be cut down to once every two weeks.

1027
01:04:45,821 --> 01:04:48,518
And then you'll be cut down
to once every none weeks.

1028
01:04:49,727 --> 01:04:51,422
God.

1029
01:04:51,896 --> 01:04:53,887
You got a hell of a life
ahead of you, kid.

1030
01:04:55,101 --> 01:04:56,500
Well, you get better, Ken.

1031
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:59,663
Oh, I am. I will. I have to.

1032
01:04:59,841 --> 01:05:02,867
I signed to play shortstop
with the Red Sox this spring.

1033
01:05:03,044 --> 01:05:04,478
Fantastic.

1034
01:05:04,646 --> 01:05:07,946
Actually, I signed to wear
red socks for the shortstops.

1035
01:05:08,118 --> 01:05:11,317
Actually, I'm dating a shortstop
who was wearing red socks.

1036
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:15,450
- Bye, Ken. See you.
- I have to stop red mark on my socks.

1037
01:05:15,628 --> 01:05:17,096
And I got my red socks.

1038
01:05:17,264 --> 01:05:18,789
"Bye, Ken. "

1039
01:05:18,967 --> 01:05:21,458
Lissa, you ever been to a disco?

1040
01:05:21,636 --> 01:05:23,536
See you, Lissa.

1041
01:05:52,811 --> 01:05:53,801
Mr. Harrison.

1042
01:05:53,979 --> 01:05:55,470
The very same.

1043
01:05:56,016 --> 01:05:57,677
I'm Sandy Jacobs.

1044
01:05:57,852 --> 01:05:59,979
You're a psychiatrist.

1045
01:06:00,154 --> 01:06:01,713
Does it show?

1046
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:03,620
Thank you, nurse.
I'll watch him now.

1047
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:06,763
- Okay. I'll see you. I'll be outside.
- Thank you, Roberta.

1048
01:06:07,632 --> 01:06:09,098
You for me or against me?

1049
01:06:09,266 --> 01:06:12,326
Oh, did that sound like paranoia?

1050
01:06:13,071 --> 01:06:16,667
You would hardly expect me
to make an instant diagnosis.

1051
01:06:16,843 --> 01:06:19,837
Well, did Dr. Emerson send you?

1052
01:06:23,352 --> 01:06:26,948
Would you describe yourself
as suffering from paranoia?

1053
01:06:27,124 --> 01:06:28,489
Nope.

1054
01:06:28,659 --> 01:06:30,127
What would you say paranoia was?

1055
01:06:30,295 --> 01:06:32,763
Well, I think it would depend
on the person, myself...

1056
01:06:32,931 --> 01:06:35,196
...but generally speaking,
I think it's someone...

1057
01:06:35,368 --> 01:06:38,668
...who believes that what they think
is right and will brook no denial.

1058
01:06:38,839 --> 01:06:41,810
Now, if this person were a sculptor...

1059
01:06:41,978 --> 01:06:45,540
...we would, indeed,
diagnose this condition as paranoia.

1060
01:06:45,716 --> 01:06:50,155
If, however, the person were a doctor,
we would call it professionalism.

1061
01:06:54,395 --> 01:06:56,522
You don't like doctors.

1062
01:06:57,265 --> 01:06:59,028
You like your patients?

1063
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,189
Some.

1064
01:07:00,368 --> 01:07:02,269
I like some doctors.

1065
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:06,099
What is it about doctors, then?

1066
01:07:06,277 --> 01:07:08,336
Oh, I...

1067
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:13,583
I don't think many of them realize
that many of their patients...

1068
01:07:13,754 --> 01:07:16,918
...can and want to understand
what's wrong with them...

1069
01:07:17,091 --> 01:07:20,424
...and they're capable of making
decisions about their own bodies.

1070
01:07:20,963 --> 01:07:23,056
And what they need,
of course, is information.

1071
01:07:23,233 --> 01:07:27,864
Well, a doctor doles out information like
a kosher butcher doles out pork sausages.

1072
01:07:31,577 --> 01:07:35,709
That's true, but wouldn't you agree
patients need medical knowledge...

1073
01:07:35,884 --> 01:07:38,217
...in order to make good decisions?
- Absolutely.

1074
01:07:38,688 --> 01:07:43,626
I would be very grateful for any information
so that I might make the proper decision.

1075
01:07:43,794 --> 01:07:46,787
It would, however, be my decision.

1076
01:07:48,967 --> 01:07:50,731
Now, let's just say, for example...

1077
01:07:50,903 --> 01:07:55,001
...that you came into my studio and you
took a look at my pieces and you said:

1078
01:07:55,176 --> 01:07:58,704
"Well, I think I'll take the mother and child,"
and I said, "No, no, no.

1079
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:02,875
You don't know a damn thing
about sculpting. You get the flamingo. "

1080
01:08:03,053 --> 01:08:04,953
You'd think I was nuts.

1081
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:08,991
But we are not talking
about a piece of sculpture.

1082
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:10,560
We're talking about your life.

1083
01:08:10,730 --> 01:08:12,460
That's right. That's exactly right.

1084
01:08:12,632 --> 01:08:14,099
My life. Think about it.

1085
01:08:14,267 --> 01:08:17,432
And your obvious intelligence
weakens your case.

1086
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:20,405
I'm not saying that you
would find life easy.

1087
01:08:20,577 --> 01:08:25,710
I'm saying that you have resources
an unintelligent person doesn't have.

1088
01:08:25,884 --> 01:08:27,078
No, no, no. Wait a minute.

1089
01:08:27,252 --> 01:08:29,653
That's not fair. That's Catch-22.

1090
01:08:29,822 --> 01:08:32,485
If you're clever enough
and sane enough...

1091
01:08:32,659 --> 01:08:36,255
...to put forth an invincible
argument for suicide...

1092
01:08:36,431 --> 01:08:39,560
...that demonstrates
that you ought not to die?

1093
01:08:40,169 --> 01:08:44,267
You know, you've got a nasty little
tidiness compulsion there.

1094
01:08:45,877 --> 01:08:47,175
I was an only child.

1095
01:08:47,446 --> 01:08:48,971
But enough of me.

1096
01:08:49,149 --> 01:08:52,380
Well, what about your parents?
Are they living?

1097
01:08:52,552 --> 01:08:55,454
No. No. I have no living relatives,
which really isn't bad...

1098
01:08:55,623 --> 01:08:58,594
...considering birthdays
and Christmas.

1099
01:08:58,761 --> 01:08:59,887
You know, presents?

1100
01:09:00,063 --> 01:09:02,362
After all, how many
hats can you wear?

1101
01:09:04,836 --> 01:09:06,828
Listen, I'd like to do some tests.

1102
01:09:07,006 --> 01:09:09,976
Tests? What kind of tests?

1103
01:09:10,143 --> 01:09:13,375
I'll tell you right now,
my time in the 100-yard dash is rotten.

1104
01:09:14,148 --> 01:09:16,014
And I'd like to confer
with Dr. Emerson.

1105
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:20,556
Confer. That's when two doctors
support each other's mistakes, right?

1106
01:09:21,559 --> 01:09:24,620
- You seem very angry.
- No shit.

1107
01:09:24,796 --> 01:09:26,890
What are you gonna do?

1108
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:32,097
Put me down as being in the manic phase
of a manic-depressive cycle?

1109
01:09:32,272 --> 01:09:34,434
No, I certainly would not do that,
Mr. Harrison.

1110
01:09:34,609 --> 01:09:36,702
Your lawyer, Mr. Hill,
asked me to see you.

1111
01:09:36,878 --> 01:09:39,370
- If anything, I'm on your team.
- My team?

1112
01:09:40,484 --> 01:09:43,579
Dr. Barrows, do you understand
the trap that I am in?

1113
01:09:43,754 --> 01:09:46,383
Can anyone prove
that they're sane?

1114
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:49,252
Could you?

1115
01:09:52,801 --> 01:09:54,793
I'll come and see
you another time.

1116
01:10:00,511 --> 01:10:03,913
No, you will not
come and see me...

1117
01:10:04,082 --> 01:10:06,483
...because each
time you see me...

1118
01:10:06,652 --> 01:10:10,988
...the more I will get angry
and frustrated and depressed.

1119
01:10:11,159 --> 01:10:13,492
Please just leave me alone!

1120
01:11:29,561 --> 01:11:31,358
Hello?

1121
01:11:32,397 --> 01:11:33,660
Pat?

1122
01:11:35,669 --> 01:11:37,501
Anybody here?

1123
01:12:42,025 --> 01:12:44,187
Oh, God.

1124
01:13:11,765 --> 01:13:12,755
Hello?

1125
01:13:13,935 --> 01:13:16,336
- Hi.
- Hi.

1126
01:13:18,041 --> 01:13:19,942
- Sorry I couldn't meet you.
- That's okay.

1127
01:13:20,111 --> 01:13:24,173
I rehearse and study and perform,
and take care of the studio...

1128
01:13:24,349 --> 01:13:26,943
...and arrange Ken's
business affairs.

1129
01:13:27,119 --> 01:13:29,111
His work's gone up a lot.

1130
01:13:29,288 --> 01:13:31,553
- Did you get a look around?
- Oh, yeah, I did.

1131
01:13:31,725 --> 01:13:35,094
It's pretty amazing.
He has an incredible talent.

1132
01:13:35,264 --> 01:13:37,755
Yes. He had.

1133
01:13:40,504 --> 01:13:42,496
Here's your key. Thank you.

1134
01:13:42,674 --> 01:13:44,005
The place is really great.

1135
01:13:44,175 --> 01:13:45,973
- I'm gonna have to close it up.
- Really?

1136
01:13:46,145 --> 01:13:47,737
Turn Ken's work over to a gallery.

1137
01:13:47,913 --> 01:13:50,144
They're just better equipped
to take care of it.

1138
01:13:50,316 --> 01:13:52,649
I wanna thank you for
agreeing to this meeting.

1139
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:56,188
You'll have to excuse my rush.
I'm late. I have a date.

1140
01:13:57,994 --> 01:14:02,262
Well, just go ahead.
I'll just take a couple minutes.

1141
01:14:04,103 --> 01:14:07,699
Pat, I could really use your advice.

1142
01:14:08,408 --> 01:14:12,175
I'm looking for some possible way
to help out Ken Harrison.

1143
01:14:12,346 --> 01:14:15,510
Some way to get through to him.

1144
01:14:17,387 --> 01:14:19,982
You mean, the late Ken Harrison.

1145
01:14:20,157 --> 01:14:23,355
- What do you mean?
I mean, he's not... - Yes, he is.

1146
01:14:23,529 --> 01:14:27,625
He may not be to you,
but he is to me and to himself.

1147
01:14:30,637 --> 01:14:36,043
Understand me, doctor.
I loved the late Ken Harrison.

1148
01:14:36,779 --> 01:14:40,615
- And I grieve for his death but...
- I'm sorry. I don't understand this.

1149
01:14:40,785 --> 01:14:43,619
I can't believe you're just
giving up on him like this.

1150
01:14:43,789 --> 01:14:45,724
Giving him up?

1151
01:14:46,192 --> 01:14:48,161
Ken Harrison is gone, doctor.

1152
01:14:49,396 --> 01:14:50,694
You wanna see Ken?

1153
01:14:50,866 --> 01:14:52,858
Look around you.

1154
01:14:53,035 --> 01:14:57,028
- Take a better look.
- Yes, I know. He's...

1155
01:14:57,206 --> 01:15:00,336
He's special. That's why we've gotta
find a way to change his mind.

1156
01:15:00,712 --> 01:15:04,945
Look, Pat, I know that if we can just
get him to wait a couple of months...

1157
01:15:05,118 --> 01:15:06,710
Dr. Scott.

1158
01:15:06,887 --> 01:15:10,325
I respect Ken's wishes
because I respect Ken.

1159
01:15:10,492 --> 01:15:12,927
Why can't you do that?

1160
01:15:13,096 --> 01:15:14,723
Why don't you respect him?

1161
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:16,888
I do.

1162
01:15:18,469 --> 01:15:21,927
Then just let him do
what he wants to do.

1163
01:15:24,577 --> 01:15:26,408
Let him go.

1164
01:15:35,659 --> 01:15:38,220
Wake up, bimbo, it's feeding time.

1165
01:15:39,731 --> 01:15:41,996
I can't wait.

1166
01:15:46,907 --> 01:15:49,638
- Dinner is served...
- Oh, not leftover Thanksgiving.

1167
01:15:51,279 --> 01:15:52,713
- Chicken.
- Oh, how creative.

1168
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:56,250
Chicken instead of turkey, I see.

1169
01:15:56,421 --> 01:15:59,983
Why are there no bunny rabbits
on my bib?

1170
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:02,355
I want bunny rabbits on my bib.

1171
01:16:02,529 --> 01:16:05,293
- I want bunny rabbits...
- Shut up.

1172
01:16:05,465 --> 01:16:07,933
Eat. You eat.

1173
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:11,239
Be a good boy.

1174
01:16:11,673 --> 01:16:12,935
Oh, great.

1175
01:16:13,108 --> 01:16:16,568
I'm eating the drumstick and
you're licking your fingers.

1176
01:16:16,747 --> 01:16:18,443
- You must be starving.
- I'm...

1177
01:16:18,617 --> 01:16:22,418
Why don't you eat the drumstick
and I will lick your fingers?

1178
01:16:22,588 --> 01:16:24,352
How about the peas?
Wanna try the peas?

1179
01:16:24,524 --> 01:16:26,288
I hate peas. They're all clones.

1180
01:16:26,461 --> 01:16:28,588
No, I'm not ready for the peas.
I'm not ready...

1181
01:16:28,763 --> 01:16:30,857
- Come on.
- Wasn't totally ready for the peas.

1182
01:16:31,033 --> 01:16:32,125
Come on, don't be gross.

1183
01:16:32,301 --> 01:16:36,262
I want you to make a circle
with your thumb and your forefinger.

1184
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:39,103
My thumb and my forefinger.

1185
01:16:39,278 --> 01:16:40,940
Like that.

1186
01:16:41,114 --> 01:16:42,638
Oh, I know what you're gonna do...

1187
01:16:42,816 --> 01:16:45,377
- Bull's-eye.
- Right on the mark, baby.

1188
01:16:47,857 --> 01:16:51,384
Here, I'll put the peas back in
where they came from.

1189
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:52,550
Watch out.

1190
01:16:52,729 --> 01:16:54,663
I'm a quadriplegic, you can't hit me.

1191
01:16:55,533 --> 01:16:56,897
Yes, you can.

1192
01:16:57,067 --> 01:16:58,695
Yes, you can.

1193
01:16:58,870 --> 01:17:00,463
I think the evidence is against me.

1194
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:05,345
But I don't think that we're
talking about euthanasia.

1195
01:17:05,513 --> 01:17:07,379
Well, I'm sorry,
because I think we are.

1196
01:17:07,549 --> 01:17:10,519
Well, what would you think
if by a sudden miracle...

1197
01:17:10,687 --> 01:17:13,316
...Ken gained the use of his arms
for 30 seconds...

1198
01:17:13,490 --> 01:17:16,516
...and swallowed a bottle
full of sleeping pills?

1199
01:17:18,863 --> 01:17:22,426
What would your reaction be?

1200
01:17:22,602 --> 01:17:26,004
Look, I told you I'm a doctor and I
have a responsibility to my patient.

1201
01:17:26,174 --> 01:17:27,699
- Yeah... No.
- Okay?

1202
01:17:27,876 --> 01:17:30,607
You, as you.

1203
01:17:32,016 --> 01:17:34,577
You mean, how I would
really feel about that?

1204
01:17:39,392 --> 01:17:42,260
I don't know. I guess...

1205
01:17:43,163 --> 01:17:46,964
I guess a part of me might
be a little relieved, why?

1206
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:48,728
Would you try to save his life?

1207
01:17:48,904 --> 01:17:51,669
With stomach pumps and all that?

1208
01:17:56,415 --> 01:17:57,882
I...

1209
01:17:59,052 --> 01:18:00,450
I don't think I would.

1210
01:18:01,121 --> 01:18:03,248
Great. So we're not adversaries.

1211
01:18:05,292 --> 01:18:06,624
No.

1212
01:18:06,795 --> 01:18:12,895
Well, so I've got a bottle of Rémy
at my place...

1213
01:18:13,070 --> 01:18:16,235
...waiting for two non-adversaries
to open.

1214
01:18:16,409 --> 01:18:19,072
- No, thank you.
- It's very close.

1215
01:18:19,246 --> 01:18:22,239
No, it would be...
A nightcap after a good dinner.

1216
01:18:22,417 --> 01:18:26,514
No. Thanks very much but I gotta...
I gotta go.

1217
01:19:00,701 --> 01:19:03,102
Oh, it couldn't possibly be two hours...

1218
01:19:03,271 --> 01:19:05,433
I thought I'd change
your position early.

1219
01:19:05,608 --> 01:19:07,770
I didn't expect to see
you here tonight.

1220
01:19:07,945 --> 01:19:10,709
Yeah, I had some work
to finish up in the office.

1221
01:19:11,749 --> 01:19:15,447
- You look real nice.
- Well, thank you.

1222
01:19:16,288 --> 01:19:19,748
- You been out?
- Yeah, I went out to dinner.

1223
01:19:20,261 --> 01:19:21,991
Good company?

1224
01:19:22,598 --> 01:19:24,533
You're fishing.

1225
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,559
You're right.

1226
01:19:26,736 --> 01:19:29,171
Actually, yes,
it was very good company.

1227
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:31,332
I had dinner with your lawyer,
Carter Hill.

1228
01:19:31,509 --> 01:19:34,377
Well, well, well.
The horny little bugger.

1229
01:19:34,546 --> 01:19:36,742
- Didn't take him long.
- It was just a dinner.

1230
01:19:36,916 --> 01:19:39,579
I know I asked him to represent me
but this is ridiculous.

1231
01:19:39,753 --> 01:19:40,879
It was just a dinner.

1232
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:44,992
Did my surrogate
self behave myself?

1233
01:19:45,161 --> 01:19:47,153
Yes, you were a
perfect gentleman.

1234
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:48,992
I want you to get another surrogate.

1235
01:19:49,167 --> 01:19:50,931
Could you, please?

1236
01:19:52,004 --> 01:19:53,062
Why?

1237
01:19:53,238 --> 01:19:54,228
Do you really mind?

1238
01:19:54,406 --> 01:19:55,931
No.

1239
01:19:59,547 --> 01:20:04,612
Ken, I might've done something that
you're not gonna be real thrilled about.

1240
01:20:05,054 --> 01:20:06,682
Something bad.

1241
01:20:06,857 --> 01:20:08,325
- Man.
- Yeah.

1242
01:20:08,493 --> 01:20:10,462
This I gotta hear.

1243
01:20:10,629 --> 01:20:13,394
Well, I went to your studio.

1244
01:20:14,601 --> 01:20:15,932
You went to my studio?

1245
01:20:16,102 --> 01:20:17,193
What for?

1246
01:20:17,369 --> 01:20:19,065
I don't know.

1247
01:20:19,639 --> 01:20:22,336
I guess because I wanted
to know more about you.

1248
01:20:22,510 --> 01:20:24,103
Know more about me?

1249
01:20:24,279 --> 01:20:28,103
No woman had ever examined me
so thoroughly.

1250
01:20:28,285 --> 01:20:31,722
I'm really glad I got a
chance to see your work.

1251
01:20:34,427 --> 01:20:37,455
I think you're...
Well, you're okay.

1252
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:40,897
- You're good.
- Thank you.

1253
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:45,168
So I was just thinking maybe you'd
wanna have a couple of pieces here.

1254
01:20:45,342 --> 01:20:47,777
- Well, look, I'll make you a deal.
- What?

1255
01:20:47,945 --> 01:20:50,779
You can take any pieces
that you like...

1256
01:20:50,949 --> 01:20:52,542
...free of charge.
What do you say?

1257
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:54,745
You know,
I'm very glad you just said that...

1258
01:20:54,922 --> 01:21:01,261
...because I just happen to have
here with me one of your pieces.

1259
01:21:02,132 --> 01:21:03,996
An art thief on top of it all.

1260
01:21:04,167 --> 01:21:05,929
Yeah.

1261
01:21:06,102 --> 01:21:08,230
It's just so amazing.

1262
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:11,273
- You do have excellent taste.
- Well, thank you.

1263
01:21:11,443 --> 01:21:16,542
And it happens to be
my favorite piece in the studio.

1264
01:21:16,717 --> 01:21:20,154
- I think it's the best thing in the studio.
- It's beautiful.

1265
01:21:20,322 --> 01:21:21,551
It's by Michelangelo.

1266
01:21:21,724 --> 01:21:24,558
What? This...

1267
01:21:24,728 --> 01:21:27,458
It's a realization from
the Sistine Chapel.

1268
01:21:27,631 --> 01:21:30,931
- You see, God, who gives life to man...
- Oh, shit.

1269
01:21:37,445 --> 01:21:41,611
This is Michelangelo.
Well, it's obvious.

1270
01:21:42,185 --> 01:21:44,950
Is my face a little red right now?

1271
01:21:45,556 --> 01:21:48,322
- Look, I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

1272
01:21:48,494 --> 01:21:50,826
Really. Don't be sorry.

1273
01:21:50,997 --> 01:21:53,159
Actually, come to think of it...

1274
01:21:53,967 --> 01:21:56,197
...I wouldn't mind looking at that
now and again.

1275
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:58,271
Ken, I'm...

1276
01:21:59,541 --> 01:22:04,674
I'm getting this very strange feeling
that you're really enjoying all this.

1277
01:22:04,848 --> 01:22:07,181
I'll tell you something, Clare...

1278
01:22:07,653 --> 01:22:12,591
...this is the first time in months that I've
begun to feel like a human being again.

1279
01:22:12,759 --> 01:22:14,818
And isn't that the whole point, Ken?

1280
01:22:15,296 --> 01:22:17,663
I mean, isn't that what
all this is about?

1281
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:22,237
I'm sorry, I just can't believe
you're really fighting for death.

1282
01:22:22,406 --> 01:22:23,395
I just don't buy that.

1283
01:22:23,574 --> 01:22:27,945
You're right,
in that I had to be sure...

1284
01:22:28,114 --> 01:22:31,551
...that I really wanted to win
what I was fighting for, you know.

1285
01:22:31,718 --> 01:22:36,452
That I wasn't just doing it in order
to prove to myself that I was still alive.

1286
01:22:36,624 --> 01:22:38,684
And are you sure?

1287
01:22:39,396 --> 01:22:41,091
Oh, yeah.

1288
01:22:41,765 --> 01:22:43,290
Yeah.

1289
01:22:46,637 --> 01:22:48,105
Yeah.

1290
01:22:48,273 --> 01:22:51,038
Clare, could you fix
these pillows for me?

1291
01:22:52,679 --> 01:22:54,170
Sure.

1292
01:22:56,017 --> 01:22:57,985
Clare? Clare.

1293
01:22:58,153 --> 01:23:00,554
Life for me is over.

1294
01:23:00,723 --> 01:23:03,522
I cannot do the things I wanna do.

1295
01:23:04,796 --> 01:23:08,528
I can't even say the
things I wanna say.

1296
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:12,796
So for me...

1297
01:23:12,973 --> 01:23:15,465
...it might as well be over.

1298
01:23:18,482 --> 01:23:21,576
You do understand that, don't you?

1299
01:23:23,253 --> 01:23:24,983
Yeah.

1300
01:23:26,659 --> 01:23:29,185
- So...
- So...

1301
01:23:29,362 --> 01:23:33,391
...tomorrow, on with the fight.
- Right.

1302
01:23:33,569 --> 01:23:35,502
On with the fight.

1303
01:23:38,374 --> 01:23:41,071
- Good night.
- Good night.

1304
01:23:44,615 --> 01:23:46,106
Clare?

1305
01:23:46,284 --> 01:23:48,116
You driving home?

1306
01:23:48,287 --> 01:23:51,018
- Yeah.
- Use your seat belts.

1307
01:23:57,233 --> 01:23:58,792
Good night.

1308
01:23:59,536 --> 01:24:01,129
Good night.

1309
01:24:06,845 --> 01:24:09,782
- I'm gonna lose my job.
- You're not gonna lose your job, baby.

1310
01:24:09,950 --> 01:24:12,545
Not for doing something like this.
Hey, come on. Cool it.

1311
01:24:12,721 --> 01:24:14,586
Be quiet, we're almost there.

1312
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:18,559
Okay, now.

1313
01:24:18,729 --> 01:24:21,756
- You got to be ready, now.
- Yeah, okay.

1314
01:24:29,308 --> 01:24:30,833
- Okay.
- Okay. Let's go.

1315
01:24:53,608 --> 01:24:55,236
What are you doing?

1316
01:24:55,411 --> 01:24:59,042
- You're not supposed to be on duty tonight.
- There's duty and there's duty.

1317
01:24:59,216 --> 01:25:01,185
- What are you doing?
- Hey.

1318
01:25:01,353 --> 01:25:04,016
Keep that blabber
shut closed, okay?

1319
01:25:08,028 --> 01:25:10,623
- Where are you going?
- Dialysis.

1320
01:25:25,017 --> 01:25:27,009
- Hi, Ken. How you doing?
- Pretty good.

1321
01:25:27,187 --> 01:25:29,952
- But where are you...?
- Dialysis.

1322
01:25:32,361 --> 01:25:34,796
Now that I know we're
not going to dialysis, where...?

1323
01:25:34,964 --> 01:25:36,159
Hey.

1324
01:25:36,333 --> 01:25:39,825
For one time
in your life, man, shut up.

1325
01:25:44,644 --> 01:25:46,772
- What took so long?
- I came as fast as I could.

1326
01:25:46,947 --> 01:25:48,108
Now, shut up, woman.

1327
01:26:04,971 --> 01:26:06,598
One, two...

1328
01:26:06,773 --> 01:26:09,608
one, two, three, four!

1329
01:26:59,978 --> 01:27:03,677
Shake, shake.
Shake, shake, shake.

1330
01:27:06,588 --> 01:27:08,648
Shake, shake, shake.

1331
01:27:10,826 --> 01:27:11,952
Hey, man.

1332
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:14,029
Yeah, we was jamming, man.

1333
01:27:16,167 --> 01:27:19,228
Hey, Ken, I want you to meet the
members of the Rebel Rockers, man.

1334
01:27:19,404 --> 01:27:21,270
- Here on keyboards is G.T., man.
- Hey.

1335
01:27:21,441 --> 01:27:23,740
- We got Red Locks here.
- How you doing?

1336
01:27:23,911 --> 01:27:26,142
Right there, man, Teodoro.

1337
01:27:26,314 --> 01:27:29,045
And toking on some ganja,
Rossan, right here.

1338
01:27:29,218 --> 01:27:30,982
Herbal inspiration.

1339
01:27:32,289 --> 01:27:34,985
Is that an illicit narcotic I see?

1340
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:37,959
- No, this is herbal.
- Herbal, schmerbal.

1341
01:27:38,130 --> 01:27:41,032
- Get it over here.
- On the steel drums there, man...

1342
01:27:41,201 --> 01:27:43,635
...is Michael, you know.
- What about Sonora?

1343
01:27:43,804 --> 01:27:45,397
Sonora?

1344
01:27:47,276 --> 01:27:50,337
Check it. One love.

1345
01:27:50,513 --> 01:27:52,277
- I think he like that, man.
- Hey, John.

1346
01:27:52,449 --> 01:27:54,314
- I think he like it, now.
- John, wait.

1347
01:27:54,485 --> 01:27:57,978
- Play that song you did last night.
- All the rockers, you want to rock, man?

1348
01:27:58,156 --> 01:28:00,921
Yo. Hey. One, two...

1349
01:28:01,093 --> 01:28:03,460
one, two, three, four!

1350
01:29:42,631 --> 01:29:43,859
Stop.

1351
01:29:44,032 --> 01:29:46,331
Wait, everybody stop.

1352
01:29:46,502 --> 01:29:48,994
Listen, stop, somebody's coming.

1353
01:29:49,173 --> 01:29:50,401
Stop.

1354
01:29:50,574 --> 01:29:53,066
- Stop it. Somebody's coming.
- Somebody's coming.

1355
01:29:55,114 --> 01:29:57,242
Forget the doobie
and get the microphone, man.

1356
01:29:57,417 --> 01:29:58,907
Hurry, man. Hurry, now.

1357
01:30:02,524 --> 01:30:05,255
Get the ganja, man.
Get the ganja.

1358
01:30:05,428 --> 01:30:07,829
- Come on back. Let's go.
- Hurry it up. Get the door.

1359
01:30:07,999 --> 01:30:11,869
- Oh, shit, man. I forgot my cymbals.
- Okay. What is?

1360
01:30:12,037 --> 01:30:14,437
What the hell is going on here?

1361
01:30:15,107 --> 01:30:17,804
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

1362
01:30:18,712 --> 01:30:21,273
Isn't this dialysis?

1363
01:30:22,183 --> 01:30:24,812
Okay, one, two, three.

1364
01:30:25,855 --> 01:30:28,347
- All the way over.
- Come on.

1365
01:30:29,827 --> 01:30:31,227
Rodriguez.

1366
01:30:31,397 --> 01:30:34,526
Rodriguez, my beloved saint.

1367
01:30:35,035 --> 01:30:37,868
Couldn't you spare me three
or four thousand aspirin, please?

1368
01:30:38,038 --> 01:30:40,337
- How about one Tylenol?
- How about two Tylenol?

1369
01:30:40,508 --> 01:30:42,500
I got my lawyer coming this morning.

1370
01:30:42,677 --> 01:30:44,475
So, what were you doing
in the basement?

1371
01:30:44,647 --> 01:30:48,244
I was on my way to dialysis.

1372
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:50,685
Your breath smells
like my whole neighborhood.

1373
01:30:52,324 --> 01:30:53,917
Who is that?

1374
01:30:54,194 --> 01:30:58,656
Who is that? It couldn't be a doctor.
They all wear Italian loafers and silk socks.

1375
01:30:58,833 --> 01:31:00,529
Carter Hill.

1376
01:31:00,702 --> 01:31:03,364
The man who sues, eats,
and chases girls for me.

1377
01:31:03,539 --> 01:31:05,132
- How you doing?
- Oh, I'm all right.

1378
01:31:05,308 --> 01:31:07,641
- How are you feeling this morning?
- Just wonderful.

1379
01:31:07,812 --> 01:31:09,336
Okay. Back over.

1380
01:31:09,513 --> 01:31:12,381
Turn him slowly. He gets dizzy
because of lack of circulation.

1381
01:31:12,552 --> 01:31:15,283
Yeah, I don't get to circulate
very much anymore.

1382
01:31:15,456 --> 01:31:17,618
So, what's your decision?

1383
01:31:17,792 --> 01:31:20,660
So, how are you feeling
this morning, Mr. Harrison?

1384
01:31:20,830 --> 01:31:24,733
You slept well last night, did you?

1385
01:31:24,901 --> 01:31:27,302
Like I got hit in the
head by a spade.

1386
01:31:27,472 --> 01:31:30,135
Oh, cute, man, cute,
for a cripple.

1387
01:31:31,009 --> 01:31:32,568
I'm...

1388
01:31:33,179 --> 01:31:34,943
I'm going to...

1389
01:31:35,783 --> 01:31:38,582
...represent you.
- All right.

1390
01:31:39,755 --> 01:31:42,350
- When is the hearing? Why?
- I haven't applied for it yet.

1391
01:31:42,526 --> 01:31:45,222
- Two reason... Excuse me.
- Sadler, get the Tylenol, please?

1392
01:31:45,395 --> 01:31:46,795
- Why not?
- Two reasons.

1393
01:31:46,965 --> 01:31:49,230
Commitment judges usually find
for the hospital...

1394
01:31:49,401 --> 01:31:50,993
...and I...

1395
01:31:51,170 --> 01:31:53,502
I think I have something better.

1396
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:55,701
Really?

1397
01:31:56,076 --> 01:31:58,170
That sounds interesting.

1398
01:32:03,086 --> 01:32:05,351
Miss Rodriguez.

1399
01:32:05,523 --> 01:32:10,120
Could it be that Dr. Emerson
suggested to you that you...

1400
01:32:10,295 --> 01:32:12,662
...hang around
while my attorney was here?

1401
01:32:13,667 --> 01:32:16,000
I'm just here in case you
get excited or something.

1402
01:32:16,171 --> 01:32:18,936
Rodriguez, it's you that excites me.

1403
01:32:19,842 --> 01:32:22,175
Where are you going?
Get away from there, you slut.

1404
01:32:22,345 --> 01:32:25,942
You Puerto Rican flesh pudding,
I love you.

1405
01:32:26,885 --> 01:32:29,480
Thought I was gonna get lucky
there for a second.

1406
01:32:29,656 --> 01:32:31,556
So, what's better?

1407
01:32:31,724 --> 01:32:33,522
I wanna go for
a writ of habeas corpus.

1408
01:32:34,395 --> 01:32:36,921
Habeas corpus? I thought
that had to do with criminals.

1409
01:32:37,098 --> 01:32:38,623
Usually it does.

1410
01:32:38,834 --> 01:32:42,736
It is against the law to deprive anyone
of his liberty without due process.

1411
01:32:42,906 --> 01:32:46,343
And if that happens, he can apply
for a writ of habeas corpus...

1412
01:32:46,511 --> 01:32:49,413
...which means, "give us the...

1413
01:32:50,183 --> 01:32:51,741
...body. "

1414
01:32:55,056 --> 01:32:56,819
That's right on the nose, in my case.

1415
01:32:57,258 --> 01:33:00,821
And if sufficient cause can't be
established to detain the individual...

1416
01:33:00,997 --> 01:33:03,466
...the judge will order him released.

1417
01:33:04,869 --> 01:33:08,431
- How long will this take?
- Not long. A couple of days.

1418
01:33:09,308 --> 01:33:11,368
- And will I have to go to court?
- I doubt it.

1419
01:33:11,545 --> 01:33:15,142
I would think that any judge would allow
the hearing to take place right here.

1420
01:33:15,317 --> 01:33:17,581
Well, well, well.

1421
01:33:21,993 --> 01:33:24,963
All's well that ends.

1422
01:33:25,597 --> 01:33:28,624
Well, I'm off to find the judge.

1423
01:33:28,801 --> 01:33:30,030
See you soon.

1424
01:33:30,204 --> 01:33:32,229
Be an unusual case
for you, won't it?

1425
01:33:32,406 --> 01:33:35,342
Making a plea for
your client's death?

1426
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:39,539
Look, I'll be honest with you.
This is a case I could bear to lose.

1427
01:33:39,949 --> 01:33:42,316
Well, if you do,
it's a life sentence for me.

1428
01:34:12,493 --> 01:34:14,689
You're new, aren't you?

1429
01:34:15,197 --> 01:34:16,426
Yup.

1430
01:34:16,599 --> 01:34:19,262
- What's your name?
- Stella.

1431
01:34:19,437 --> 01:34:21,166
Stella?

1432
01:34:21,605 --> 01:34:24,302
Well, Stella, you're very kind.

1433
01:34:24,743 --> 01:34:27,712
Most of the nurses just yank
you around till they wake you up...

1434
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:31,874
...and then they disappear
for about two hours.

1435
01:34:35,123 --> 01:34:39,152
You're trying to be released, aren't you?
Be taken off your medication?

1436
01:34:39,329 --> 01:34:41,355
Everybody knows about it, huh?

1437
01:34:41,532 --> 01:34:43,899
Oh, yeah. Sure.

1438
01:34:47,875 --> 01:34:49,968
Aren't you afraid?

1439
01:34:55,752 --> 01:34:57,220
Yeah.

1440
01:35:05,665 --> 01:35:09,899
- This what you wanted, now?
- Oh, yes. If you'll put it behind this desk.

1441
01:35:15,744 --> 01:35:18,805
Don't I get a special breakfast
or anything?

1442
01:35:18,982 --> 01:35:23,512
Not for some miserable jive-ass
moaning on about wanting to die.

1443
01:35:30,165 --> 01:35:32,930
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1444
01:35:38,542 --> 01:35:39,942
Hey.

1445
01:35:41,613 --> 01:35:43,171
Aren't you gonna wish me luck?

1446
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:45,817
No.

1447
01:35:48,623 --> 01:35:50,386
Hey, I wish you luck.

1448
01:35:57,401 --> 01:35:59,199
Judge Wyler.

1449
01:36:00,304 --> 01:36:01,795
Thank you.

1450
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:04,172
Please sit down.

1451
01:36:05,612 --> 01:36:09,379
This is an informal hearing, which
I'd like to keep as brief as possible.

1452
01:36:10,017 --> 01:36:11,451
Mr. Kenneth Harrison?

1453
01:36:11,620 --> 01:36:13,054
Yes, Your Honor?

1454
01:36:13,223 --> 01:36:17,752
Mr. Harrison, I've decided in consultation
with Mr. Eden and Mr. Hill...

1455
01:36:17,929 --> 01:36:21,421
...not to subject you to examination
and cross-examination.

1456
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:25,436
- Your Honor, there may be things I want to...
- Mr. Harrison, if I have any doubts...

1457
01:36:25,606 --> 01:36:28,508
...I'll question you myself.
Dr. Emerson, we'll start with you.

1458
01:36:28,676 --> 01:36:32,238
- Will you take the oath, please?
Mr. Eden? - Thank you.

1459
01:36:35,186 --> 01:36:36,881
Raise your right hand.

1460
01:36:37,054 --> 01:36:40,924
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony
you are about to give will be the truth...

1461
01:36:41,094 --> 01:36:44,154
...the whole truth, nothing but the truth?
- I do.

1462
01:36:44,330 --> 01:36:45,423
Be seated.

1463
01:36:45,599 --> 01:36:47,761
Dr. Emerson,
what is your position here?

1464
01:36:47,936 --> 01:36:50,029
I'm chief of medical services.

1465
01:36:50,205 --> 01:36:53,107
Would you give the court
a medical history of the treatment...

1466
01:36:53,276 --> 01:36:54,938
...Mr. Harrison has received here?

1467
01:36:55,112 --> 01:37:00,074
Following an automobile accident
on the evening of April 27th of this year...

1468
01:37:00,252 --> 01:37:03,017
...Mr. Harrison was admitted
to this hospital in shock...

1469
01:37:03,784 --> 01:37:07,246
...and suffering from a fractured left
tibia, fractured right tibia and fibula...

1470
01:37:07,281 --> 01:37:10,859
...fractured pelvis. Four fractured ribs,
one of which punctured the right lung.

1471
01:37:11,033 --> 01:37:14,471
A dislocated fourth cervical vertebrae,
which crushed the spinal cord.

1472
01:37:14,638 --> 01:37:17,164
He suffered internal damage
to the spleen and kidney...

1473
01:37:17,342 --> 01:37:20,312
...for which we performed a splenectomy
and double nephrectomies.

1474
01:37:20,479 --> 01:37:23,677
He remained unconscious for 30 hours.
As a result of treatment here...

1475
01:37:23,851 --> 01:37:26,252
...all the bones and ruptured tissue
have healed...

1476
01:37:26,422 --> 01:37:28,686
...with the exception of the spinal cord.

1477
01:37:28,857 --> 01:37:32,658
That, together with the mental trauma,
are all that remain of the initial injury.

1478
01:37:32,829 --> 01:37:35,628
Will there be an improvement
in the spinal cord?

1479
01:37:36,134 --> 01:37:37,226
No.

1480
01:37:37,402 --> 01:37:39,735
- Kidney function?
- I regret not.

1481
01:37:40,138 --> 01:37:42,630
And the mental trauma?

1482
01:37:42,809 --> 01:37:46,567
It's impossible to violate the body to
the extent of Mr. Harrison's without

1483
01:37:46,982 --> 01:37:50,434
suffering severe mental aberration,
depression, even loss of reality.

1484
01:37:50,469 --> 01:37:54,212
In your view, is Mr. Harrison
suffering from such mental aberration?

1485
01:37:54,391 --> 01:37:55,950
He's depressed.

1486
01:37:56,127 --> 01:37:57,685
Clinically depressed?

1487
01:37:57,862 --> 01:37:59,330
Yes, clinically depressed.

1488
01:37:59,498 --> 01:38:01,558
Thank you, doctor. That's all.

1489
01:38:02,002 --> 01:38:04,164
Mr. Hill? Just one second, please.

1490
01:38:04,338 --> 01:38:07,672
Doctor, is there any way you can
demonstrate this clinical depression...

1491
01:38:07,844 --> 01:38:10,370
...any tests or measurements
you can show us?

1492
01:38:11,248 --> 01:38:12,237
No.

1493
01:38:12,416 --> 01:38:14,680
Then how do you distinguish
clinical depression...

1494
01:38:14,852 --> 01:38:18,517
...which might preclude the ability
to make informed and logical decisions...

1495
01:38:18,691 --> 01:38:21,559
...from a perfectly sane, justified
feeling of depression...

1496
01:38:21,728 --> 01:38:23,663
...as a result of existing conditions?

1497
01:38:23,831 --> 01:38:26,858
By relying on my 18 years as a physician
dealing with both types.

1498
01:38:27,036 --> 01:38:30,438
- Are you a psychiatrist, Dr. Emerson?
- No.

1499
01:38:30,607 --> 01:38:32,838
Have you any degrees, credentials...

1500
01:38:33,010 --> 01:38:36,105
...or have you any specialized
training in psychiatry?

1501
01:38:36,948 --> 01:38:38,313
No.

1502
01:38:39,484 --> 01:38:41,180
No further questions.

1503
01:38:42,056 --> 01:38:44,217
- Mr. Eden?
- No further questions.

1504
01:38:44,392 --> 01:38:46,383
Thank you, doctor. You're excused.

1505
01:38:48,531 --> 01:38:50,397
Dr. Robert Barrows.

1506
01:38:50,567 --> 01:38:53,537
Dr. Robert Barrows
to the stand, please.

1507
01:38:53,705 --> 01:38:55,901
Dr. Barrows,
what position do you hold?

1508
01:38:56,075 --> 01:38:59,308
I'm the consulting psychiatrist
at the Monroe State Mental Hospital.

1509
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:03,814
Then you must see a large number of
patients suffering from depressive illness.

1510
01:39:03,985 --> 01:39:05,384
Yes, I do.

1511
01:39:05,554 --> 01:39:07,716
All right.
You've examined Mr. Harrison?

1512
01:39:07,890 --> 01:39:10,257
Well, we know that,
or else why would he be here?

1513
01:39:10,427 --> 01:39:13,454
- Remember the word "informal. "
- Yes, Your Honor.

1514
01:39:14,133 --> 01:39:19,333
Would you say that Mr. Harrison
is suffering from a depressive illness?

1515
01:39:19,506 --> 01:39:21,839
- No, I would not.
- The court has heard evidence...

1516
01:39:22,009 --> 01:39:25,445
...that Mr. Harrison is depressed.
Do you dispute that?

1517
01:39:25,613 --> 01:39:31,054
In my opinion, he's reacting in a perfectly
rational manner to a very bad situation.

1518
01:39:31,222 --> 01:39:33,122
No further questions.

1519
01:39:33,458 --> 01:39:35,791
- Mr. Eden?
- Doctor.

1520
01:39:35,962 --> 01:39:39,592
Are there any objective results that
you could produce that would prove...

1521
01:39:39,767 --> 01:39:41,736
...that Mr. Harrison is capable?

1522
01:39:42,170 --> 01:39:45,004
There are clinical symptoms
of endogenous depression.

1523
01:39:45,174 --> 01:39:49,305
Disturbed sleep patterns, loss of appetite,
lassitude, and many more.

1524
01:39:49,479 --> 01:39:54,316
Even if they were present, they'd be masked
by Mr. Harrison's physical condition.

1525
01:39:54,486 --> 01:39:59,118
Then how can you be sure that this is,
in fact, a reactive depression?

1526
01:39:59,293 --> 01:40:00,955
By experience.

1527
01:40:01,129 --> 01:40:04,964
By discovering when I talked to him
that he has a remarkably incisive mind...

1528
01:40:05,135 --> 01:40:07,900
...and is perfectly capable
of understanding his position...

1529
01:40:08,072 --> 01:40:10,096
...and deciding what he wants
to do about it.

1530
01:40:10,274 --> 01:40:12,071
Do you think he
made the right decision?

1531
01:40:12,242 --> 01:40:14,040
Your Honor, is this relevant?

1532
01:40:15,381 --> 01:40:18,317
- No, not really.
- I'd like to answer that, if I may.

1533
01:40:19,921 --> 01:40:21,411
Go ahead.

1534
01:40:25,295 --> 01:40:26,922
No.

1535
01:40:27,231 --> 01:40:28,823
I think he made the wrong decision.

1536
01:40:29,233 --> 01:40:31,168
- Oh, shit.
- Mr. Hill.

1537
01:40:31,336 --> 01:40:34,305
When I said "informal," I didn't mean
uncontrolled. Now be quiet.

1538
01:40:34,473 --> 01:40:37,773
- I'm sorry. I...
- Thank you, doctor.

1539
01:40:37,945 --> 01:40:39,504
That's all.

1540
01:40:41,182 --> 01:40:45,177
Dr. Jacobs, the consulting psychiatrist for
the hospital, wasn't able to be here today.

1541
01:40:45,355 --> 01:40:48,382
I have a sworn affidavit.
He agrees with Dr. Emerson's position.

1542
01:40:48,559 --> 01:40:50,551
- Have it entered in the record.
- Yes, Your Honor.

1543
01:40:51,531 --> 01:40:54,296
Mr. Harrison, you feel like
answering some questions?

1544
01:40:55,134 --> 01:40:56,534
Yes, I do.

1545
01:40:57,004 --> 01:40:59,370
I'll try to keep them
uninflammatory.

1546
01:40:59,540 --> 01:41:01,338
- You're too kind.
- Not at all.

1547
01:41:01,509 --> 01:41:05,378
No, I meant that. I think I'd
much prefer a hanging judge.

1548
01:41:08,118 --> 01:41:10,383
Either way I decide,
I am a hanging judge.

1549
01:41:11,090 --> 01:41:15,084
Now, Mr. Harrison, the medical director
and the consulting psychiatrist...

1550
01:41:15,262 --> 01:41:19,222
...claim that you're not capable of
making an informed, intelligent decision.

1551
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:21,062
That's right. They're wrong.

1552
01:41:21,803 --> 01:41:24,967
- What does that mean?
- It means they're good doctors.

1553
01:41:25,141 --> 01:41:28,271
And they won't let a patient die
if they can help it.

1554
01:41:30,148 --> 01:41:32,242
Do you think you're suffering
from depression?

1555
01:41:32,418 --> 01:41:35,651
Well, I am completely paralyzed.

1556
01:41:35,823 --> 01:41:37,849
I think I'd be insane if
I wasn't depressed.

1557
01:41:38,027 --> 01:41:40,052
But wanting to die
must be strong evidence...

1558
01:41:40,229 --> 01:41:42,994
...that your mental state has gone
beyond simple depression.

1559
01:41:43,166 --> 01:41:46,193
- I do not want to die. - Then what
the hell is this case all about?

1560
01:41:47,739 --> 01:41:50,572
Make that read,
"Then what is this case all about?"

1561
01:41:50,742 --> 01:41:53,733
There was a "hell," and I
think he said "shit" before,

1562
01:41:54,058 --> 01:41:56,177
so maybe you ought to cross...

1563
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:00,211
Sorry.

1564
01:42:03,726 --> 01:42:07,960
I do not want to die, because as far
as I am concerned, I am dead already.

1565
01:42:08,132 --> 01:42:11,125
I merely want the doctors
to recognize that fact.

1566
01:42:11,303 --> 01:42:15,002
I cannot believe that this...

1567
01:42:15,776 --> 01:42:17,745
This condition...

1568
01:42:17,913 --> 01:42:21,281
...constitutes life
in any real sense of the word.

1569
01:42:21,451 --> 01:42:22,714
Legally, you're alive.

1570
01:42:22,886 --> 01:42:25,617
I think I could challenge even that.

1571
01:42:26,457 --> 01:42:29,690
Any reasonable definition
of the word "life"...

1572
01:42:29,862 --> 01:42:32,491
...must include the idea
that it be self-supporting.

1573
01:42:32,666 --> 01:42:35,727
Now, isn't it true that
in heart transplant cases...

1574
01:42:35,903 --> 01:42:39,169
...it's legal to take someone's heart
if they can only be kept alive...

1575
01:42:39,341 --> 01:42:42,175
...by the use of respirators
and other medical hardware?

1576
01:42:42,345 --> 01:42:44,746
There also has to be
no brain activity at all.

1577
01:42:44,915 --> 01:42:48,751
- Yours is certainly working, Mr. Harrison.
- Certainly working and certainly sanely.

1578
01:42:48,921 --> 01:42:51,151
- That's what we're here to decide.
- Your Honor...

1579
01:42:51,324 --> 01:42:54,988
...I am not asking anyone to kill me.

1580
01:42:55,929 --> 01:42:58,798
I'm only asking to be discharged
from this hospital.

1581
01:42:58,968 --> 01:43:02,268
- Which will kill you.
- And that's exactly my point.

1582
01:43:02,439 --> 01:43:05,136
I'll spend the rest of my life
in this hospital...

1583
01:43:05,309 --> 01:43:10,112
...with everything in it geared
just to keeping my brain alive.

1584
01:43:10,751 --> 01:43:14,448
And I'll never have
a possibility whatsoever...

1585
01:43:14,722 --> 01:43:18,888
...of being able to direct
a good goddamn thing.

1586
01:43:19,695 --> 01:43:21,323
Now...

1587
01:43:21,498 --> 01:43:25,265
...as far as I'm concerned,
that's an act of deliberate cruelty.

1588
01:43:26,539 --> 01:43:29,440
Wouldn't it be more cruel
for society to let people die...

1589
01:43:29,608 --> 01:43:32,016
- ... when with some effort it
could save them? - No...

1590
01:43:32,279 --> 01:43:36,067
...because the cruelty is not a question of
saving someone's life or letting them die.

1591
01:43:36,527 --> 01:43:38,450
The cruelty...

1592
01:43:39,588 --> 01:43:42,821
...is that the choice is removed
from the person concerned.

1593
01:43:42,993 --> 01:43:45,929
I would like to be able to decide
what happens to my own body.

1594
01:43:46,098 --> 01:43:49,797
A man who is desperately depressed is
not capable of making a reasonable choice.

1595
01:43:49,970 --> 01:43:54,533
Well, as you said, Your Honor,
that is the question to be decided.

1596
01:43:56,779 --> 01:43:58,246
All right.

1597
01:43:58,614 --> 01:44:01,277
All right. You tell me. You tell us.

1598
01:44:01,451 --> 01:44:05,219
You tell me why it is a reasonable choice
that you decided to die.

1599
01:44:05,390 --> 01:44:06,789
- All right.
- No.

1600
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:08,951
All right. All right.

1601
01:44:09,129 --> 01:44:12,692
The most important part
of my life was my work.

1602
01:44:12,868 --> 01:44:16,897
And the most valuable asset I had
for that was my imagination.

1603
01:44:17,074 --> 01:44:22,068
Now, it's just too damn bad that my mind
wasn't paralyzed along with my body...

1604
01:44:22,246 --> 01:44:27,345
...because my mind, which had been
my most precious possession...

1605
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:31,925
...has become my enemy,
and it tortures me.

1606
01:44:32,827 --> 01:44:36,492
It tortures me with thoughts
of what might've been...

1607
01:44:36,666 --> 01:44:41,970
...and what might be to come,
and I can...

1608
01:44:42,874 --> 01:44:45,741
...feel my mind...

1609
01:44:45,911 --> 01:44:50,373
...very slowly breaking up.
Now, you take women, for example.

1610
01:44:53,522 --> 01:44:58,928
I used to... I used to love
what they were...

1611
01:44:59,096 --> 01:45:02,726
...and how they thought
and how they smelled and...

1612
01:45:02,901 --> 01:45:07,339
And now I, I dread it
when they come into the room...

1613
01:45:07,507 --> 01:45:09,998
...because I loathe the way
they make me feel.

1614
01:45:11,245 --> 01:45:14,943
You know, I am filled with an
absolute sense of outrage...

1615
01:45:15,116 --> 01:45:18,178
...that you, who have no
knowledge of me whatsoever...

1616
01:45:18,355 --> 01:45:21,848
...have the power to condemn me
to a life of torment...

1617
01:45:22,026 --> 01:45:24,359
...because you cannot see the pain.

1618
01:45:24,530 --> 01:45:28,434
There's no blood,
there's no screaming.

1619
01:45:28,869 --> 01:45:30,666
So you can't see it?
Your Honor...

1620
01:45:30,838 --> 01:45:36,608
...if you saw a mutilated animal
on the side of the road, you'd shoot it.

1621
01:45:38,716 --> 01:45:44,588
Now, I am only asking for the same mercy
that you would show that animal.

1622
01:45:44,758 --> 01:45:48,525
And I am not asking anyone to commit
an act of violence.

1623
01:45:51,734 --> 01:45:53,292
Just...

1624
01:45:54,336 --> 01:45:56,737
...take me somewhere...

1625
01:45:58,208 --> 01:46:00,473
...and leave me.

1626
01:46:02,648 --> 01:46:04,480
And if you don't...

1627
01:46:06,452 --> 01:46:08,250
If you don't...

1628
01:46:08,856 --> 01:46:13,192
...then you come back here in five years
and you see what a piece of work...

1629
01:46:13,362 --> 01:46:16,160
...that you've done here today.

1630
01:46:31,788 --> 01:46:34,383
In hearings for a writ
of habeas corpus...

1631
01:46:34,558 --> 01:46:36,789
...an immediate
decision is mandated...

1632
01:46:36,961 --> 01:46:40,522
...but I propose to consider
the issues carefully.

1633
01:46:40,699 --> 01:46:44,797
Therefore, I request everyone
to please remain here...

1634
01:46:44,971 --> 01:46:48,408
...unless a medical emergency
preempts your presence.

1635
01:47:14,077 --> 01:47:15,511
Marjorie.

1636
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:17,512
Yeah, I'm still at the hospital.

1637
01:47:17,683 --> 01:47:20,380
I wonder if you'd look
up something for me.

1638
01:47:20,553 --> 01:47:22,351
A Florida decision.

1639
01:47:22,523 --> 01:47:25,822
About two years back.
I think it was Saikewicz.

1640
01:47:25,993 --> 01:47:28,258
You look up the holding
and read it to me, please.

1641
01:47:28,430 --> 01:47:30,331
I'll hold on.

1642
01:47:31,267 --> 01:47:33,133
See this quarter, man?

1643
01:47:33,303 --> 01:47:37,104
See the quarter, now?
Oh, you don't see it no more, huh?

1644
01:47:37,442 --> 01:47:39,968
Which hand is the quarter in now?

1645
01:47:40,346 --> 01:47:42,144
Right hand.

1646
01:47:42,516 --> 01:47:43,949
He's gonna take the right hand.

1647
01:49:07,964 --> 01:49:11,298
Will everyone please
return to your seats?

1648
01:49:18,378 --> 01:49:21,711
There are precedents aplenty
for both sides of this issue.

1649
01:49:22,516 --> 01:49:25,577
In re: Karen Ann Quinlan,
the supreme court of New Jersey...

1650
01:49:25,754 --> 01:49:31,592
...recognized the preservation of a personal
right to privacy against bodily intrusions.

1651
01:49:32,097 --> 01:49:33,834
In Belchertown v. Saikewicz,

1652
01:49:34,164 --> 01:49:37,204
the court held that the right
to refuse medical treatment...

1653
01:49:37,638 --> 01:49:40,232
...in appropriate circumstances
extends to both

1654
01:49:40,592 --> 01:49:44,132
competent and
incompetent persons.

1655
01:49:45,581 --> 01:49:48,950
And the law holds that a deliberate
decision to embark on an action...

1656
01:49:49,487 --> 01:49:54,517
...which will eventually lead to death
is not ipso facto evidence of insanity.

1657
01:49:55,394 --> 01:49:59,833
If it were, society would have to condemn
many men to dishonorable burials...

1658
01:50:00,001 --> 01:50:02,402
...rather than posthumous medals.

1659
01:50:03,205 --> 01:50:04,604
Yet...

1660
01:50:05,841 --> 01:50:07,832
...we do have to remember...

1661
01:50:08,010 --> 01:50:10,673
...Mr. Harrison's mind is affected...

1662
01:50:10,847 --> 01:50:15,878
...and we must, in this case, be careful
not to allow Mr. Harrison's intelligence...

1663
01:50:16,055 --> 01:50:21,188
...to blind us to the fact that he may
be suffering from a depressive illness...

1664
01:50:21,363 --> 01:50:25,494
...which would diminish his ability
to make an informed decision.

1665
01:50:26,136 --> 01:50:31,302
We must ignore Mr. Harrison's cogently
argued plea to be allowed to die...

1666
01:50:31,839 --> 01:50:37,665
...if we believe it to be the product of a
disturbed or clinically depressed mind.

1667
01:50:39,687 --> 01:50:41,519
However...

1668
01:50:46,096 --> 01:50:48,429
...I am satisfied...

1669
01:50:48,667 --> 01:50:51,966
...that Mr. Harrison's a brave
and thoughtful man...

1670
01:50:52,538 --> 01:50:56,474
...who is in complete possession
of his mental faculties...

1671
01:50:56,642 --> 01:50:58,941
...and I therefore order
that he be set free.

1672
01:51:10,395 --> 01:51:12,330
That's it, gentlemen.

1673
01:51:14,801 --> 01:51:16,769
Peggy, let me get that.

1674
01:51:20,909 --> 01:51:22,468
Hey...

1675
01:51:22,645 --> 01:51:24,773
...you got your hanging judge.

1676
01:51:26,918 --> 01:51:28,943
I think not.

1677
01:51:30,956 --> 01:51:32,515
Thank you.

1678
01:51:33,793 --> 01:51:36,284
Thank you very much,
Your Honor.

1679
01:51:37,798 --> 01:51:39,494
I hope so.

1680
01:51:42,405 --> 01:51:43,702
Thank you.

1681
01:51:43,874 --> 01:51:45,364
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1682
01:51:55,756 --> 01:51:57,384
Thank you.

1683
01:52:24,628 --> 01:52:26,153
Where will you go?

1684
01:52:26,330 --> 01:52:28,799
I'll get a room somewhere,
I suppose.

1685
01:52:28,967 --> 01:52:30,765
- There's no need.
- Don't start it again!

1686
01:52:30,937 --> 01:52:32,199
You can stay here.

1687
01:52:32,372 --> 01:52:34,841
We'll stop all treatment, no dialysis.

1688
01:52:35,009 --> 01:52:37,535
Even stop feeding if you like.

1689
01:52:37,712 --> 01:52:41,513
You'll be in a coma in a few days.
Dead in a week, two at most.

1690
01:52:41,818 --> 01:52:44,515
But you won't be alone.
There'll be very little discomfort.

1691
01:52:44,688 --> 01:52:47,351
No last-minute attempt
at resuscitation?

1692
01:52:47,525 --> 01:52:49,892
Only if you ask for it.

1693
01:52:50,329 --> 01:52:51,853
Thank you.

1694
01:52:52,265 --> 01:52:55,235
It would obviously be easier
for me if I stayed.

1695
01:52:55,403 --> 01:52:57,770
Okay, I'll take care of that.

1696
01:53:01,477 --> 01:53:03,605
Why are you doing this?

1697
01:53:04,716 --> 01:53:06,411
Because you might
change your mind.

1698
01:54:30,497 --> 01:54:31,862
Oh, don't.

1699
01:54:32,032 --> 01:54:33,500
Please.

1700
01:54:40,344 --> 01:54:42,438
Better not, I think.

1701
01:54:51,025 --> 01:54:52,493
Okay.

1702
01:54:54,245 --> 01:54:55,353
Okay.

1703
01:55:17,826 --> 01:55:19,934
<i>Dr. North, you are
wanted in Emergency.</i>

1704
01:55:21,494 --> 01:55:24,036
<i>Dr. North, you are
wanted in Emergency.</i>

1705
01:55:25,872 --> 01:55:29,102
<i>Dr. Keys, please call

1706
01:55:29,827 --> 01:55:33,822
