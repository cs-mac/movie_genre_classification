1
00:01:12,525 --> 00:01:14,425
So, we keep headin' east?

2
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,191
Yeah, that's the idea.

3
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:20,028
Stay out of the big cities?

4
00:01:20,066 --> 00:01:21,658
Uh-huh.

5
00:01:24,871 --> 00:01:27,931
I think I'm tired.

6
00:01:27,974 --> 00:01:31,375
Yeah. Me, too.

7
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:38,947
Here.

8
00:01:38,985 --> 00:01:41,818
Bring it on up to the office.

9
00:01:41,854 --> 00:01:43,754
I'm going to go check us out.

10
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,223
All right.

11
00:03:10,276 --> 00:03:12,039
What took you so long?

12
00:03:12,078 --> 00:03:13,636
Nothing.

13
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:18,883
I had a little trouble
with the maid..

14
00:03:18,918 --> 00:03:22,649
but everything's fine now.

15
00:03:28,928 --> 00:03:30,259
Damn.

16
00:03:32,265 --> 00:03:33,926
8:00.

17
00:03:33,966 --> 00:03:36,059
It's already this hot.

18
00:03:36,102 --> 00:03:38,627
Yep.

19
00:03:38,671 --> 00:03:40,901
How are we fixed for water?

20
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,999
Probably not enough.

21
00:03:43,042 --> 00:03:45,169
Yeah.

22
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:57,185
There's a cooler in the back
in the office.

23
00:05:39,425 --> 00:05:40,653
Hey.

24
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,667
Shh.

25
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:08,111
Aah! Aah! Aah!

26
00:06:08,154 --> 00:06:10,679
Sarah, honey, what's wrong?

27
00:06:10,723 --> 00:06:12,691
Huh?

28
00:06:12,725 --> 00:06:15,558
What is it, sweetie? Hmm?

29
00:06:15,594 --> 00:06:17,061
- Daddy.
- Yeah?

30
00:06:17,096 --> 00:06:19,894
- Daddy.
- Daddy's here.

31
00:06:19,932 --> 00:06:23,800
- Daddy's here.
- There were monsters.

32
00:06:23,836 --> 00:06:27,932
No, sweetie. There's
no such thing as monsters.

33
00:06:27,973 --> 00:06:29,668
You were just having
a bad dream.

34
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:30,869
What's wrong, Dad?

35
00:06:32,745 --> 00:06:36,476
Hi, kiddo.
Sarah's just having a bad dream.

36
00:06:36,515 --> 00:06:38,278
Oh.

37
00:06:38,317 --> 00:06:40,410
I saw monsters, Jack.

38
00:06:40,453 --> 00:06:42,284
Monsters?

39
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:44,016
What kind?

40
00:06:44,056 --> 00:06:46,388
I don't know.
They came out of my closet..

41
00:06:46,425 --> 00:06:47,983
and then
they were in the shadows.

42
00:06:48,027 --> 00:06:50,928
Mmm, shadow monsters.

43
00:06:50,963 --> 00:06:52,089
Well, they look pretty scary..

44
00:06:52,131 --> 00:06:53,758
but they really
can't do anything..

45
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:55,426
especially
when the lights are on.

46
00:06:55,468 --> 00:06:57,095
They're scared of the light.

47
00:06:57,136 --> 00:06:59,104
What happened, baby?

48
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:02,400
- You OK?
- I'm OK.

49
00:07:02,441 --> 00:07:04,341
Sarah had a bad dream
about monsters.

50
00:07:04,376 --> 00:07:06,503
- Oh.
- And I was telling her..

51
00:07:06,545 --> 00:07:08,376
that there's
no such thing as monsters.

52
00:07:08,414 --> 00:07:09,779
Oh.

53
00:07:09,815 --> 00:07:12,477
I'm going to turn on
my night light just in case.

54
00:07:12,518 --> 00:07:15,009
That sounds like
a brilliant solution.

55
00:07:16,422 --> 00:07:17,753
Mmm.

56
00:07:22,228 --> 00:07:25,129
- Hey, Jack?
- Hey, Mom?

57
00:07:25,164 --> 00:07:27,689
Morning.

58
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:29,291
Morning, baby.

59
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:34,531
Hey, hon,
the pick up still won't start.

60
00:07:34,573 --> 00:07:35,631
You mind dropping me off
on the way in?

61
00:07:35,674 --> 00:07:36,766
Sure.

62
00:07:39,812 --> 00:07:42,440
- Did you feed Burrow?
- Yeah, I fed him.

63
00:07:42,481 --> 00:07:44,813
All right. Good.

64
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,841
The night light worked,
didn't it?

65
00:07:50,923 --> 00:07:52,823
I got it, Dad.

66
00:07:58,764 --> 00:08:01,699
What do you got going today,
Jack?

67
00:08:01,734 --> 00:08:04,032
Uh, nothing much.
A math test in a few days..

68
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:07,470
and I think we're playing
baseball in gym class today..

69
00:08:07,506 --> 00:08:10,566
so I can look forward
to sucking hard in right field.

70
00:08:10,609 --> 00:08:12,201
Well, just remember..

71
00:08:13,579 --> 00:08:15,069
don't let the hitter
get the ball over your head..

72
00:08:15,114 --> 00:08:17,708
Unless it's out of the park.

73
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,742
Well, yeah.

74
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,634
Bye.

75
00:08:49,315 --> 00:08:50,942
I get off early today.
All I have..

76
00:08:50,983 --> 00:08:53,679
is the Watsons-Willard Day
bride's tractor sale.

77
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:55,482
You want me to pick you up?

78
00:08:56,622 --> 00:08:58,214
Yeah.

79
00:08:58,257 --> 00:09:01,454
Then we can go to the drive-in
and make out tonight.

80
00:09:01,493 --> 00:09:02,926
There hasn't been
a drive-in here..

81
00:09:02,962 --> 00:09:05,157
since the early seventies,
but..

82
00:09:07,466 --> 00:09:09,058
I love you.

83
00:09:09,101 --> 00:09:10,625
I love you.

84
00:09:10,669 --> 00:09:13,160
- Have a good one.
- You, too.

85
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,009
- Morning.
- Derek.

86
00:09:27,219 --> 00:09:29,517
- Hey, Tom.
- Morning, Joseph.

87
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,760
That's wild.

88
00:09:43,802 --> 00:09:45,929
- Hey, Tom.
- Morning, Pat.

89
00:09:45,971 --> 00:09:48,599
- Hey, Mick.
- Tom.

90
00:09:48,641 --> 00:09:50,131
Charles is going to be
a little late this morning.

91
00:09:50,175 --> 00:09:52,973
- Is he drunk again?
- Yeah, I guess.

92
00:09:53,012 --> 00:09:56,038
Hey, who's the craziest woman
you ever dated?

93
00:09:56,081 --> 00:09:57,378
Me?

94
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:58,678
Yeah. Mick and me,
we were talking..

95
00:09:58,717 --> 00:09:59,843
about some of the girls
we went with.

96
00:09:59,885 --> 00:10:02,319
- Uh-huh.
- He once dated a girl..

97
00:10:02,354 --> 00:10:04,845
who used to attack him
in the middle of the night.

98
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,358
- She what?
- Yeah.

99
00:10:07,393 --> 00:10:09,884
She used to have
these crazy goddamn dreams..

100
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:11,021
where instead
of her boyfriend..

101
00:10:11,063 --> 00:10:12,530
I was
some kind of demented killer.

102
00:10:12,564 --> 00:10:16,466
I woke up one night, she stuck
a goddamn fork in my shoulder.

103
00:10:16,502 --> 00:10:20,962
- You're kidding me.
- No. I'm spurting blood.

104
00:10:21,006 --> 00:10:22,371
She's sitting there crying..

105
00:10:22,408 --> 00:10:25,036
going,
"Baby, I love you, I love you."

106
00:10:26,445 --> 00:10:28,504
So, what happened?
You broke up with her, right?

107
00:10:28,547 --> 00:10:30,640
No, I married her.

108
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:35,616
Hey, it lasted six years.

109
00:10:35,654 --> 00:10:37,519
Nobody's perfect, Tom.

110
00:10:37,556 --> 00:10:40,787
I guess not.

111
00:10:44,163 --> 00:10:48,190
Strike this guy out.
We got 'em. Let's go.

112
00:10:49,635 --> 00:10:51,626
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

113
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,103
Two out.

114
00:10:58,577 --> 00:11:00,636
One winning run
coming right up, boys.

115
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:02,271
- Go, Bobby!
- Whoo!

116
00:11:02,314 --> 00:11:04,544
It's all right, Billy.

117
00:11:05,985 --> 00:11:07,748
Look alive, look alive.

118
00:11:12,725 --> 00:11:14,283
Yeah!

119
00:11:16,128 --> 00:11:17,459
Ball.

120
00:11:17,496 --> 00:11:18,827
Yeah, that's it.

121
00:11:18,864 --> 00:11:20,491
He's got nothing.
He's got nothing.

122
00:11:20,532 --> 00:11:23,194
Let's go, let's go.
One more. Come on, now.

123
00:11:25,337 --> 00:11:27,396
Come on, Bobby.

124
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:30,203
Yeah. He's yours, he's yours.

125
00:11:30,242 --> 00:11:33,609
- Oh!
- Whoo!

126
00:11:33,645 --> 00:11:36,170
- Whoo!
- Easy, Jack. Come on, Jack.

127
00:11:36,215 --> 00:11:38,012
Don't drop it, Jack!

128
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,915
- That's yours. Come on.
- Jinx, Jackie boy!

129
00:11:39,952 --> 00:11:41,078
- Oh!
- Oh!

130
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,521
Game over!
Yellows win. Let's go, guys.

131
00:11:44,556 --> 00:11:46,888
Taylor, Dietrich,
you're on equipment. Let's go.

132
00:11:51,997 --> 00:11:53,396
Guys, come on. Let's go.

133
00:11:53,432 --> 00:11:55,457
- Good try, Bobby.
- You was robbed, Bobby.

134
00:11:55,501 --> 00:11:58,231
Everyone hit the showers.

135
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,601
- Awesome.
- Nice.

136
00:12:02,641 --> 00:12:04,165
Good job.

137
00:12:16,288 --> 00:12:19,257
Guess you think
you're hot shit, huh, Stall?

138
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:22,988
What? No, I don't.

139
00:12:23,028 --> 00:12:25,189
Little hero here, huh?

140
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,061
Little superstar here.

141
00:12:27,099 --> 00:12:30,068
Little hero saves the day
at the last minute, right?

142
00:12:30,102 --> 00:12:32,627
Bobby, it's just a game, OK?

143
00:12:32,671 --> 00:12:35,367
It's just stupid gym class.

144
00:12:35,407 --> 00:12:37,568
Who you calling stupid?

145
00:12:37,609 --> 00:12:41,670
Ahem.
No, I said gym class was stupid.

146
00:12:41,713 --> 00:12:45,171
"No, I said gym class was.."
Listen to this little faggot.

147
00:12:45,217 --> 00:12:48,778
Yeah. You're right.

148
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:52,450
I'm both little and a faggot.

149
00:12:52,491 --> 00:12:54,823
You got me dead to rights.

150
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,294
Come on, chickenshit,
let's do this.

151
00:12:58,497 --> 00:13:00,021
What would be the point?

152
00:13:00,065 --> 00:13:03,034
I mean, you win.
You win, you win.

153
00:13:03,068 --> 00:13:06,799
You've established
your alpha male standing.

154
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:10,570
You've established
my unworthiness.

155
00:13:10,609 --> 00:13:13,669
But doing violence to me
just seems.. ahem..

156
00:13:13,712 --> 00:13:16,681
pointless and cruel,
don't you think?

157
00:13:16,715 --> 00:13:18,478
Let's do this, you punk bitch.

158
00:13:18,517 --> 00:13:22,920
Shouldn't that be little punk
ass chickenshit faggot bitch?

159
00:13:24,723 --> 00:13:27,487
Chickenshit faggot bitch.

160
00:13:29,027 --> 00:13:31,120
Uh-oh.

161
00:13:32,431 --> 00:13:34,524
God!

162
00:13:39,972 --> 00:13:42,440
Bobby is a chickenshit.

163
00:14:04,196 --> 00:14:06,255
Hey, good looking.

164
00:14:11,737 --> 00:14:14,228
Where are we going?

165
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:19,667
Well, Jack's studying
over at Judy Danvers'..

166
00:14:19,711 --> 00:14:23,704
and Martha's
taking care of Sarah.

167
00:14:23,749 --> 00:14:26,809
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

168
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:31,182
So, where are we going?

169
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,718
We never got to be teenagers
together.

170
00:14:37,763 --> 00:14:40,095
Uh-huh.

171
00:14:40,132 --> 00:14:43,033
I'm going to fix that.

172
00:15:24,843 --> 00:15:26,811
What's going on in there?

173
00:15:26,845 --> 00:15:29,871
Keep your shirt on. I'm coming.

174
00:15:43,228 --> 00:15:47,358
Holy cow.

175
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,897
What?

176
00:15:56,875 --> 00:16:00,311
Do you need some help with that,
big boy?

177
00:16:00,345 --> 00:16:03,644
Uh.. maybe.

178
00:16:07,586 --> 00:16:10,419
Oh, my God.

179
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,224
What have you done with my wife?

180
00:16:22,267 --> 00:16:24,792
Ready? OK!

181
00:16:24,836 --> 00:16:28,499
Go, Wildcats!

182
00:16:30,075 --> 00:16:32,600
No wives in here, mister.

183
00:16:35,614 --> 00:16:37,479
Mmm.

184
00:16:39,251 --> 00:16:41,549
- Wow.
- Shh.

185
00:16:41,586 --> 00:16:44,612
Quiet.
My parents are in the next room.

186
00:16:46,491 --> 00:16:47,958
Mmm.

187
00:16:56,101 --> 00:16:58,160
You're naughty.

188
00:17:25,897 --> 00:17:28,161
What are you doing?

189
00:17:30,102 --> 00:17:31,831
Nothing.

190
00:17:34,573 --> 00:17:37,508
You are such a bad boy.

191
00:17:37,542 --> 00:17:39,407
Mm-hmm.

192
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,705
Rah, rah, sis, boom, bah.

193
00:17:49,187 --> 00:17:50,552
Oh.

194
00:17:50,589 --> 00:17:54,525
There wasn't much of that
in high school.

195
00:17:56,595 --> 00:17:58,460
Ah..

196
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,528
Mmm.

197
00:18:13,178 --> 00:18:15,703
- Uhh.
- Mmm.

198
00:18:21,086 --> 00:18:23,714
What is it?

199
00:18:25,457 --> 00:18:27,823
Huh?

200
00:18:27,859 --> 00:18:32,057
I remember the moment
I knew you were in love with me.

201
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:37,229
I saw it in your eyes.

202
00:18:40,405 --> 00:18:42,896
I can still see it.

203
00:18:45,777 --> 00:18:47,904
Of course you can.

204
00:18:57,088 --> 00:18:59,249
I still love you.

205
00:19:10,135 --> 00:19:13,935
I'm the luckiest
son of a bitch alive.

206
00:19:17,008 --> 00:19:20,603
You are the best man
I've ever known.

207
00:19:21,613 --> 00:19:24,104
There's no luck involved.

208
00:19:36,294 --> 00:19:38,694
You want to go down
and get some food or something?

209
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,789
You ever wonder
what kids did for fun..

210
00:19:40,832 --> 00:19:43,824
on a Saturday night
a hundred years ago?

211
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:46,303
I don't know.

212
00:19:46,338 --> 00:19:47,669
I guess I always figured..

213
00:19:47,706 --> 00:19:49,230
they got into
their parents' wagon..

214
00:19:49,274 --> 00:19:51,105
and went cruising
up and down their main drag..

215
00:19:51,142 --> 00:19:53,975
playing loud banjo music
and acting like idiots.

216
00:19:56,181 --> 00:19:59,275
So, you think
this is as good as it gets?

217
00:19:59,317 --> 00:20:03,219
For us? Yeah.

218
00:20:03,255 --> 00:20:05,314
For now.

219
00:20:05,357 --> 00:20:10,056
Eventually, we.. we grow up,
we get jobs, we have affairs..

220
00:20:10,095 --> 00:20:12,154
and we become alcoholics.

221
00:20:16,668 --> 00:20:20,661
Ahem. You know, sometimes..

222
00:20:20,705 --> 00:20:22,673
you depress me.

223
00:20:26,077 --> 00:20:28,545
Hey, that's what I'm good at.

224
00:20:37,956 --> 00:20:39,218
Give me that.

225
00:20:42,193 --> 00:20:44,627
Hey, isn't that
that Stall faggot?

226
00:20:44,663 --> 00:20:46,221
Yeah.

227
00:20:47,332 --> 00:20:49,892
You should go kick his ass.

228
00:20:49,935 --> 00:20:52,597
I'm going to.

229
00:21:10,889 --> 00:21:12,015
Who the fuck was that?

230
00:21:12,057 --> 00:21:15,151
I don't know,
and I don't want to know.

231
00:21:19,431 --> 00:21:22,195
Can I just say how sick I am
of these podunk towns..

232
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:24,701
and the goddamn podunks
who live in 'em?

233
00:21:24,736 --> 00:21:27,330
Do you think
if you keep saying that..

234
00:21:27,372 --> 00:21:28,498
it's actually going
to change anything?

235
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,838
I am so sick of this shit.

236
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:35,505
Yeah, you made that clear
about ten thousand miles ago.

237
00:21:35,547 --> 00:21:36,673
Now, if you haven't got
a better idea..

238
00:21:36,715 --> 00:21:38,740
I don't want to hear
about it anymore.

239
00:21:40,485 --> 00:21:42,715
We are so goddamned broke.

240
00:21:42,754 --> 00:21:46,155
Yeah, well..

241
00:21:46,191 --> 00:21:48,159
that's easy to fix.

242
00:21:49,861 --> 00:21:51,192
No way.

243
00:21:51,229 --> 00:21:52,457
- Come on.
- Mm-mmm.

244
00:21:52,497 --> 00:21:54,431
Are you going to go shoot pool
with Jerry?

245
00:21:54,466 --> 00:21:56,696
Maybe.

246
00:21:56,735 --> 00:21:58,965
Thanks, Tom.
Thanks, Mick.. good as ever.

247
00:21:59,004 --> 00:22:01,700
There you go.

248
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,469
See you in church.

249
00:22:03,508 --> 00:22:05,100
Yep. Have a good evening.

250
00:22:05,143 --> 00:22:07,338
You, too.
See you tonight, Charlotte.

251
00:22:07,379 --> 00:22:09,244
Yeah. See you.

252
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,180
Oh, I'm sorry.

253
00:22:11,216 --> 00:22:13,582
Aw, it's all right, old fella.

254
00:22:15,086 --> 00:22:17,748
Just closing up, fellas.

255
00:22:22,794 --> 00:22:25,729
Coffee, black.

256
00:22:25,764 --> 00:22:30,497
The same. I'll have some pie..
some of that lemon meringue pie.

257
00:22:30,535 --> 00:22:34,596
Guys, guys, I'm sorry. I'm..
We're closed.

258
00:22:35,774 --> 00:22:37,867
I said.. coffee!

259
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:47,983
I guess we can handle that.

260
00:22:51,156 --> 00:22:53,488
It's not very fresh.

261
00:23:00,932 --> 00:23:02,900
You can go home now, Charlotte.

262
00:23:02,934 --> 00:23:05,801
Just leave the pie.

263
00:23:13,244 --> 00:23:14,973
Billy..

264
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,721
You're going to be sticking
around for a while, honey.

265
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:27,948
Tom?

266
00:23:31,262 --> 00:23:34,993
Don't fuckin' move.

267
00:23:44,209 --> 00:23:47,042
Sir, we don't.. we don't
carry much cash here.

268
00:23:47,078 --> 00:23:49,569
You gentlemen are certainly
welcome to all of it.

269
00:23:49,614 --> 00:23:52,174
Oh, I know that, asshole,
believe me.

270
00:23:52,217 --> 00:23:54,344
I do know that.

271
00:23:54,385 --> 00:23:56,444
- Aah!
- Shut up, bitch!

272
00:24:00,825 --> 00:24:02,918
OK, Billy..

273
00:24:02,961 --> 00:24:05,953
let's show this asshole
we mean business.

274
00:24:05,997 --> 00:24:08,090
What? Her?

275
00:24:08,133 --> 00:24:09,930
Yes, her.

276
00:24:09,968 --> 00:24:11,367
Do her!

277
00:24:14,205 --> 00:24:15,331
Aah!

278
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:26,542
Uhh.

279
00:24:26,584 --> 00:24:28,142
- Aah!
- Uhh.

280
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,187
Unh.

281
00:25:04,522 --> 00:25:06,217
I'm telling you,
those men were..

282
00:25:06,257 --> 00:25:07,781
They were going to kill us.

283
00:25:07,826 --> 00:25:11,660
They were going to kill us,
and if it weren't for Tom..

284
00:25:11,696 --> 00:25:12,720
He's a hero.

285
00:25:12,764 --> 00:25:16,131
..in conjunction with
several murders in those states.

286
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:17,657
Now, Tom Stall
is a family man..

287
00:25:17,702 --> 00:25:20,068
with longstanding ties
to this community.

288
00:25:20,104 --> 00:25:23,335
Tom Stall
was just another hard-working..

289
00:25:23,374 --> 00:25:25,035
small business
owner and operator..

290
00:25:25,076 --> 00:25:27,670
in Millbrook, Indiana,
but now..

291
00:25:27,712 --> 00:25:32,843
Um, one of the guys
had a.. a gun to my head..

292
00:25:32,884 --> 00:25:35,318
and Tom..
He was amazing. He..

293
00:25:40,692 --> 00:25:43,217
Hi, baby.

294
00:25:43,261 --> 00:25:45,286
- Hey, honey.
- How you doing?

295
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:48,493
How are you?

296
00:25:48,533 --> 00:25:50,296
Uhh.

297
00:25:50,335 --> 00:25:53,930
Are you as sick of hearing
about me as I am?

298
00:25:53,972 --> 00:25:57,533
No, I kind of like it.

299
00:25:57,575 --> 00:26:00,135
Look.
Your picture's in the paper.

300
00:26:16,895 --> 00:26:18,658
Oh, God.

301
00:26:19,664 --> 00:26:20,858
Careful.

302
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:27,761
- Hi, guys.
- Mom.

303
00:26:27,805 --> 00:26:31,332
Can l.. Can I get up now?

304
00:26:31,376 --> 00:26:33,344
- You got it, Dad?
- Yeah.

305
00:26:33,378 --> 00:26:35,642
- Way to go, Tommy.
- We're all here for you, Tom.

306
00:26:37,782 --> 00:26:38,976
Way to go, Tom.

307
00:26:39,017 --> 00:26:42,180
- Hi, sweetie.
- Oh, that's so nice.

308
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:46,054
Thank you so much for coming.

309
00:26:48,126 --> 00:26:49,923
We're in Millbrook,
just outside the home..

310
00:26:49,961 --> 00:26:52,054
of American hero Tom Stall..

311
00:26:52,096 --> 00:26:55,554
who's just now returning from
the hospital with his family.

312
00:26:58,436 --> 00:27:01,599
Mr. Stall,
Jenny Wyatt, WRPK news.

313
00:27:01,639 --> 00:27:04,437
I have a few questions for you.
How did it feel..

314
00:27:04,475 --> 00:27:06,409
when you saw the guns
of those ruthless killers..

315
00:27:06,444 --> 00:27:07,911
pointed directly at you?

316
00:27:07,946 --> 00:27:11,814
- How did it feel?
- Yeah.

317
00:27:11,849 --> 00:27:13,908
Not very good.

318
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,949
Not very good.

319
00:27:17,989 --> 00:27:19,183
Were you surprised, though..

320
00:27:19,223 --> 00:27:21,418
by your own reaction
to the situation?

321
00:27:21,459 --> 00:27:25,657
Uh.. what I did was..

322
00:27:25,697 --> 00:27:28,325
I mean,
anybody would have done that.

323
00:27:28,366 --> 00:27:31,858
It was just..
It was a terrible thing.

324
00:27:31,903 --> 00:27:35,339
I think we'll all be better off
when we get past it.

325
00:27:35,373 --> 00:27:37,034
Yeah, but you really went
beyond what the average..

326
00:27:37,075 --> 00:27:40,169
l.. I need to.. I really need
to be with my family.

327
00:27:40,211 --> 00:27:41,940
Thanks.

328
00:27:43,381 --> 00:27:46,646
I'm Jenny Wyatt in Millbrook,
and that was Tom Stall..

329
00:27:46,684 --> 00:27:50,245
American hero, man of few words.

330
00:27:51,522 --> 00:27:54,389
Well, I guess that's all
we're going to get.

331
00:27:59,063 --> 00:28:00,963
Man, it's good to be home.

332
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:03,331
I hope there won't be
too much more of that.

333
00:28:08,272 --> 00:28:09,603
Hey, Dad, they all just
want to interview you..

334
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,335
because of what you did.

335
00:28:12,343 --> 00:28:14,971
You're a hero, Dad. Ha ha!

336
00:28:15,013 --> 00:28:16,947
No, I'm not.

337
00:28:16,981 --> 00:28:19,313
I just got lucky.. very lucky.

338
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,408
This will all blow over..

339
00:28:20,451 --> 00:28:22,078
as soon as they find
some other hot story.

340
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,352
Yeah. Maybe the Lydons will have
another two-headed cow.

341
00:28:26,391 --> 00:28:27,722
You guys
aren't thinking big enough.

342
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:30,091
You could probably do
Larry King Live, Dad.

343
00:28:30,128 --> 00:28:33,063
- That would be cool.
- Oh, you stop it. Stop it.

344
00:28:34,332 --> 00:28:36,129
Look at this.. more reporters.

345
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:39,034
Are they still there?

346
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,061
Yeah. Now there's some car
parked across the road.

347
00:28:41,105 --> 00:28:43,073
- They're just sitting there.
- Huh.

348
00:28:43,107 --> 00:28:45,234
- Does anyone want some tea?
- I'll take some, Mom.

349
00:28:45,276 --> 00:28:46,607
Yes, please.

350
00:28:46,644 --> 00:28:50,011
Unh. Aw, jeez.

351
00:29:08,499 --> 00:29:10,091
Hey, Edie.

352
00:29:10,134 --> 00:29:11,294
Hi. How are you?

353
00:29:11,335 --> 00:29:13,565
- Did you go to the shop?
- Yes, sir.

354
00:29:13,604 --> 00:29:15,663
Hello. Hey, Bill.

355
00:29:15,706 --> 00:29:18,607
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, baby. How are you?

356
00:29:18,643 --> 00:29:21,271
Oh, I'm all right.
What brings you by?

357
00:29:21,312 --> 00:29:22,677
I just wanted to see
how you were doing.

358
00:29:22,713 --> 00:29:25,511
Doing good. Business is great.
Just can't keep up.

359
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,518
Yeah, it's busy.

360
00:29:27,552 --> 00:29:31,352
Oh, look, more reporters. Nice.

361
00:29:31,389 --> 00:29:35,086
They don't look like reporters.

362
00:29:35,126 --> 00:29:37,720
Grilled cheese is ready.

363
00:29:37,762 --> 00:29:42,290
Got fries
and a strawberry shake.

364
00:29:44,102 --> 00:29:46,195
Hello. Welcome to Stall's.

365
00:29:46,237 --> 00:29:48,205
Would you gentlemen
like some coffee?

366
00:29:48,239 --> 00:29:50,673
You're the hero.

367
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:54,307
Uh, I don't know, sir.
I was just..

368
00:29:54,345 --> 00:29:55,539
Nah, you're the big hero.

369
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,879
You sure took care
of those two bad men.

370
00:29:58,916 --> 00:30:02,249
I really don't like
talking about it, sir.

371
00:30:02,286 --> 00:30:04,584
We're trying to get
back to normal here.

372
00:30:04,622 --> 00:30:06,681
So, can I offer you gentlemen
some coffee?

373
00:30:06,724 --> 00:30:09,318
Sure. Give me some coffee.
Make it black..

374
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,193
- Yes, sir.
- Joey.

375
00:30:14,132 --> 00:30:16,862
And.. and your friends?

376
00:30:16,901 --> 00:30:18,493
They don't drink coffee.

377
00:30:18,536 --> 00:30:22,700
It doesn't agree
with them.. Joey.

378
00:30:24,175 --> 00:30:26,905
- Who's Joey?
- You are.

379
00:30:30,114 --> 00:30:33,572
- My name's Tom, sir.
- Of course it is.

380
00:30:40,892 --> 00:30:42,985
Mmm. That's good coffee.

381
00:30:44,662 --> 00:30:46,289
Thank you, sir.

382
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:49,629
If I were to find coffee
as good in Philadelphia..

383
00:30:49,667 --> 00:30:52,534
but you know that,
don't you, Tom?

384
00:30:53,804 --> 00:30:55,567
Heh.

385
00:30:55,606 --> 00:30:59,736
No, actually, I don't.
I've never been to Philadelphia.

386
00:30:59,777 --> 00:31:02,575
Pennsylvania? Is that where
you gentlemen are from?

387
00:31:02,613 --> 00:31:05,707
Yeah, like you don't know.

388
00:31:06,884 --> 00:31:09,717
Sorry.
Did.. Did we know each other?

389
00:31:19,463 --> 00:31:21,260
You tell me.

390
00:31:22,767 --> 00:31:24,667
No.

391
00:31:24,702 --> 00:31:26,192
We don't know each other.

392
00:31:26,237 --> 00:31:27,932
Come on, Joey. Cut the crap.

393
00:31:27,972 --> 00:31:29,439
My name is Tom.

394
00:31:29,473 --> 00:31:34,172
Joey Cusack.
Your name is Joey Cusack.

395
00:31:34,212 --> 00:31:35,577
You're from Philly.

396
00:31:37,915 --> 00:31:41,214
- Mm-hmm. OK. Whatever.
- Uh-huh.

397
00:31:42,954 --> 00:31:46,287
Excuse me, gentlemen, if you're
not going to order anything..

398
00:31:46,324 --> 00:31:47,450
my husband and I
would appreciate it..

399
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:48,549
if you would be on your way.

400
00:31:48,593 --> 00:31:51,187
We ate on the road.

401
00:31:51,229 --> 00:31:53,254
It's all right.

402
00:31:53,297 --> 00:31:54,855
It's OK.

403
00:31:54,899 --> 00:32:00,235
We really are very busy here
today, as you can see.

404
00:32:00,271 --> 00:32:03,434
Um, so if you gentlemen
aren't going to be eating..

405
00:32:03,474 --> 00:32:07,570
I really should offer
your seats to paying customers.

406
00:32:07,612 --> 00:32:08,874
Hmm.

407
00:32:11,015 --> 00:32:12,380
Well..

408
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,511
now we're paying customers.

409
00:32:20,191 --> 00:32:21,783
I can't take this.

410
00:32:21,826 --> 00:32:23,418
It shouldn't be
any problem for you.

411
00:32:23,461 --> 00:32:25,156
What is that supposed to mean?

412
00:32:25,196 --> 00:32:28,188
Mr. Fogarty's
just making conversation here.

413
00:32:28,232 --> 00:32:29,665
Well, whatever
you want to call it..

414
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,327
this conversation is over.

415
00:32:31,369 --> 00:32:33,860
I think he wants us to leave,
Mr. Fogarty.

416
00:32:33,904 --> 00:32:35,098
Do you know what he does..

417
00:32:35,139 --> 00:32:36,766
when he don't like people,
Mr. Fogarty?

418
00:32:36,807 --> 00:32:38,399
Yeah. I'm scared.

419
00:32:38,442 --> 00:32:41,377
We should leave before he goes
all Dirty Harry on us.

420
00:32:44,248 --> 00:32:46,580
I want to thank you
for the coffee, Joey.

421
00:32:46,617 --> 00:32:49,245
It really is very good.

422
00:32:49,287 --> 00:32:52,450
It's Tom. My name's Tom Stall.

423
00:33:08,239 --> 00:33:10,036
Excuse me.

424
00:33:14,412 --> 00:33:16,175
What are you doing?
Who are you calling?

425
00:33:16,213 --> 00:33:20,206
Hi.. Hi, Molly.
This is Edie Stall. Is he in?

426
00:33:20,251 --> 00:33:21,548
I'm fine, thanks.

427
00:33:21,585 --> 00:33:23,143
You're calling Sam?

428
00:33:23,187 --> 00:33:24,745
Yes.

429
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:02,191
Is there a problem
with my driving, officer?

430
00:34:02,226 --> 00:34:04,694
Can I see your license, sir?

431
00:34:04,729 --> 00:34:06,321
Sure.

432
00:34:11,068 --> 00:34:13,593
I thought I was under the limit.

433
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,368
Is there some problem
I should know about?

434
00:34:19,443 --> 00:34:21,411
What's your business
in Millbrook, sir?

435
00:34:21,445 --> 00:34:23,208
We're tourists.

436
00:34:23,247 --> 00:34:27,411
And what business did you have
at Stall's Diner today?

437
00:34:27,451 --> 00:34:29,646
We heard the coffee
was terrific.

438
00:34:29,687 --> 00:34:35,319
Let me make something clear
to you and to Mr. Mulligan.

439
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:36,792
Uh-huh?

440
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:39,352
This is a nice town.

441
00:34:39,397 --> 00:34:41,831
We have nice people here.

442
00:34:41,866 --> 00:34:44,061
We take care of our nice people.

443
00:34:44,101 --> 00:34:47,093
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah, sure.

444
00:34:48,406 --> 00:34:50,670
Don't let me see you around
again.

445
00:34:50,708 --> 00:34:53,176
You keep up the good work,
officer.

446
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:09,323
Charles Roarke, Philadelphia.

447
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,955
Indicted
on three counts of murder.

448
00:35:12,997 --> 00:35:15,966
Frank Mulligan,
out of New York..

449
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,400
indicted on one count of murder.

450
00:35:18,436 --> 00:35:21,928
Questioned in relation
to dozens of acts of violence..

451
00:35:21,972 --> 00:35:24,566
that you don't want
to hear about.

452
00:35:25,643 --> 00:35:28,134
Both men work for Carl Fogarty.

453
00:35:28,179 --> 00:35:30,010
He's the fella with the eye.

454
00:35:30,047 --> 00:35:33,505
He spent fifteen years in prison
on several counts of assault.

455
00:35:33,551 --> 00:35:36,111
He's suspected
in half a dozen murders..

456
00:35:36,153 --> 00:35:38,519
and more disappearances.

457
00:35:38,556 --> 00:35:43,050
Tom, these guys are organized
crime from the east coast.

458
00:35:43,093 --> 00:35:46,062
Now, they're the real thing.
They're bad men.

459
00:35:46,096 --> 00:35:49,691
Jesus. Jesus, honey.

460
00:35:51,135 --> 00:35:53,660
I have to ask you a question.

461
00:35:57,441 --> 00:36:00,035
Are you in some kind
of witness protection plan?

462
00:36:01,145 --> 00:36:03,545
- Sam.
- Some kind of what?

463
00:36:03,581 --> 00:36:05,071
This is no laughing matter,
Edie.

464
00:36:05,115 --> 00:36:07,015
Of course he's not, Sam.

465
00:36:07,051 --> 00:36:10,384
I'd just like to hear
Tom say that.

466
00:36:16,193 --> 00:36:21,221
OK. No. No,
I'm not in a witness program.

467
00:36:21,265 --> 00:36:23,165
Those men just have
the wrong guy.

468
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,259
They must've seen me on TV,
and I guess, uh..

469
00:36:25,302 --> 00:36:27,463
I reminded them
of this Johnny guy.

470
00:36:27,505 --> 00:36:29,496
- Joey.
- J-Joey somebody.

471
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:33,203
I mean, good lord.
The idea of me..

472
00:36:33,244 --> 00:36:36,680
I never honestly believed it,
but I had to ask.

473
00:36:36,714 --> 00:36:41,947
I've done some research
on this, uh, Joey Cusack.

474
00:36:41,986 --> 00:36:44,181
I didn't find anything.

475
00:36:44,221 --> 00:36:47,713
But there is a Richie Cusack
in Philadelphia.

476
00:36:47,758 --> 00:36:49,953
Apparently, he's the head..

477
00:36:49,994 --> 00:36:53,987
of some kind of crime syndicate
in that city.

478
00:36:54,031 --> 00:36:57,489
Men like this come to our town
and start harassing a citizen..

479
00:36:57,535 --> 00:36:58,866
we have to take them seriously.

480
00:36:58,903 --> 00:37:00,564
Sure.

481
00:37:01,739 --> 00:37:05,004
All right. So, if you folks
see them coming around..

482
00:37:05,042 --> 00:37:06,373
you let me know.

483
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:08,776
Will do.

484
00:37:08,812 --> 00:37:12,009
I'm sorry, Sam. Do you want
a piece of pie or something?

485
00:37:12,049 --> 00:37:13,482
Ah, no, thanks, Edie.

486
00:37:13,517 --> 00:37:16,281
I'd love to,
but I've gotta get back to work.

487
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,117
Thank you. Thanks for coming.

488
00:37:18,155 --> 00:37:21,022
Uh, Sam? Thank you.

489
00:37:21,058 --> 00:37:23,151
It's good to know
you're watching out for us.

490
00:37:23,193 --> 00:37:25,787
Come on, Tom.

491
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:28,229
You know we look out
for our own here.

492
00:37:28,265 --> 00:37:31,564
- Good night.
- Good night.

493
00:37:31,602 --> 00:37:33,763
See ya. Thanks.

494
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:45,614
Huh.

495
00:37:49,553 --> 00:37:51,111
Don't worry.

496
00:37:52,756 --> 00:37:54,747
They're as good as gone.

497
00:38:01,165 --> 00:38:04,430
Sorry. Sorry.

498
00:38:08,472 --> 00:38:10,531
It's over and done with.

499
00:39:18,342 --> 00:39:20,037
Honey. Can you get that, hon?

500
00:39:20,077 --> 00:39:22,272
Come on, come on!

501
00:39:26,116 --> 00:39:27,276
Hello?

502
00:39:27,317 --> 00:39:29,148
The shotgun, Edie!
Get the shotgun!

503
00:39:29,186 --> 00:39:30,710
Tom, Tom.. Tom, what's wrong?

504
00:39:30,754 --> 00:39:32,244
They're coming to the house!

505
00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:33,551
Who's coming to the house?

506
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,217
Just grab it!
Do it and be ready!

507
00:39:35,259 --> 00:39:36,419
OK, stop. Are you serious?

508
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,621
I'll be there as soon as I can.

509
00:39:43,067 --> 00:39:44,557
Shit.

510
00:39:55,112 --> 00:39:57,478
Come on.

511
00:40:04,154 --> 00:40:05,781
Oh, shit.

512
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,584
Oh, come on.

513
00:40:15,899 --> 00:40:17,560
Come on.

514
00:40:39,223 --> 00:40:40,781
Edie! Oh.

515
00:40:40,824 --> 00:40:43,918
Ohh, fuck. Tom!

516
00:40:45,462 --> 00:40:48,761
Tom. Tom, what's going on?

517
00:40:48,799 --> 00:40:49,925
Huh?

518
00:40:49,967 --> 00:40:51,992
L.. I don't know, baby.

519
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:54,128
Jesus.

520
00:40:54,171 --> 00:40:56,366
What's going on?

521
00:40:56,406 --> 00:40:59,637
I don't.. I don't know. Ohh.

522
00:40:59,676 --> 00:41:02,440
Let me call Sam, all right?

523
00:41:02,479 --> 00:41:04,310
No, don't.

524
00:41:04,348 --> 00:41:06,543
L.. I don't even know..

525
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:10,883
L.. I don't know
why I thought.. I..

526
00:41:10,921 --> 00:41:12,650
Mom?

527
00:41:12,689 --> 00:41:14,316
It's OK, baby.

528
00:41:20,364 --> 00:41:25,427
Yeah. Uh.. ha ha. L..

529
00:41:25,469 --> 00:41:28,927
L.. I.. I think
I'm losing my mind.

530
00:41:28,972 --> 00:41:31,634
No, no, no. OK.
You're not losing your mind.

531
00:41:31,675 --> 00:41:34,644
You've been through
some serious trauma, all right?

532
00:41:34,678 --> 00:41:36,646
I'm here for you, baby.
We're all here for you.

533
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,079
It's all right.
It's gonna be OK.

534
00:41:38,115 --> 00:41:39,878
Mom?

535
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:43,045
You haven't forgotten about
my new shoes, have you?

536
00:41:43,086 --> 00:41:45,714
Gosh, no. It's my top priority
for the day.

537
00:41:45,756 --> 00:41:47,121
How could I forget?
You all right?

538
00:41:47,157 --> 00:41:49,921
Yeah, yeah. Hi.. Hi, sweetie.

539
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,894
Honey,
just get ready for school.

540
00:41:51,929 --> 00:41:53,556
I'll speak to you afterwards,
all right?

541
00:41:56,366 --> 00:41:58,391
Come on.

542
00:41:58,435 --> 00:42:00,528
Let's go shopping.

543
00:42:16,053 --> 00:42:17,543
Hey.

544
00:42:19,122 --> 00:42:20,589
Careful. It's loaded.

545
00:42:33,003 --> 00:42:36,939
Why was Mom running
around the house with that?

546
00:42:36,974 --> 00:42:38,965
What's going on, Dad?

547
00:42:39,009 --> 00:42:41,569
False alarm.

548
00:42:41,612 --> 00:42:43,671
Nothing to worry about.

549
00:42:45,015 --> 00:42:46,642
I am worried.

550
00:42:46,683 --> 00:42:49,652
You're sweating.
You're soaked, Dad.

551
00:42:49,686 --> 00:42:51,415
What kind of false alarm?

552
00:42:51,455 --> 00:42:53,150
What did you mean,
you think you..

553
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,657
You think
you're losing your mind?

554
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:58,927
Some mob guys
showed up at the diner.

555
00:43:00,197 --> 00:43:05,396
They saw me on TV, and they
came by to take a look at me.

556
00:43:05,435 --> 00:43:07,232
Yeah.

557
00:43:07,271 --> 00:43:10,297
Yeah, I heard about that.
Uh, so..

558
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,637
They thought they knew me.

559
00:43:13,543 --> 00:43:17,741
They thought..
I was somebody else.

560
00:43:17,781 --> 00:43:19,578
Heh. That's weird.

561
00:43:19,616 --> 00:43:22,847
Yeah. Weird.

562
00:43:22,886 --> 00:43:25,753
And I guess, um..
Well, I guess..

563
00:43:25,789 --> 00:43:28,451
they don't like this guy
they think you are.

564
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:32,223
Apparently not.

565
00:43:32,262 --> 00:43:35,425
And, um, and I guess l..

566
00:43:35,465 --> 00:43:37,660
I guess.. I guess they want..

567
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:39,794
to kill this guy
they think you are?

568
00:43:39,836 --> 00:43:43,203
See, that's.. that's
the losing my mind part.

569
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,731
I mean, I have no reason
to think that.

570
00:43:45,776 --> 00:43:49,712
It's just I was down at work,
and, you know..

571
00:43:49,746 --> 00:43:54,513
suddenly I thought
maybe.. maybe..

572
00:43:54,551 --> 00:43:57,111
they'd come looking around.

573
00:43:57,154 --> 00:43:58,451
You know?

574
00:44:01,391 --> 00:44:03,791
And, uh..

575
00:44:03,827 --> 00:44:06,955
And then you came running
back here to save us?

576
00:44:06,997 --> 00:44:10,626
Yeah, something silly like that.

577
00:44:11,935 --> 00:44:13,994
I'm sorry.

578
00:44:14,037 --> 00:44:16,904
What if you're right?

579
00:44:20,911 --> 00:44:23,038
Then we deal with it.

580
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:15,758
Now, look what I just found.

581
00:45:15,799 --> 00:45:18,859
It's my last pair in this style,
and it's exactly your size.

582
00:45:18,902 --> 00:45:21,132
Just try these on.
They should fit like a dream.

583
00:45:22,539 --> 00:45:24,006
How do they feel?

584
00:45:24,041 --> 00:45:26,839
Good. Yeah, I think I like them.

585
00:45:26,877 --> 00:45:28,276
I have a pair of these myself.

586
00:45:28,311 --> 00:45:29,539
They look great
and they really last.

587
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:32,412
Really? OK. I'll take them.

588
00:45:32,449 --> 00:45:34,917
And I needed a pair
for her as well.

589
00:45:36,486 --> 00:45:38,283
Sarah?

590
00:45:41,892 --> 00:45:43,450
Sarah?

591
00:45:43,493 --> 00:45:45,358
- Uh, ma'am? The shoes..
- I have to find my daughter.

592
00:45:45,395 --> 00:45:46,828
I can't let you leave the store
with the shoes.

593
00:45:46,863 --> 00:45:49,331
OK, OK, OK. Sarah!

594
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,693
Sarah?

595
00:45:55,639 --> 00:45:57,539
Sarah?

596
00:46:07,918 --> 00:46:12,048
Sarah. Sarah.
Don't ever do that again, OK?

597
00:46:12,089 --> 00:46:13,454
I'm sorry, Mommy.

598
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:15,583
But look.
They have the new Vespa dolls.

599
00:46:15,625 --> 00:46:17,115
Nothin' to worry about,
Mrs. Stall.

600
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,025
I've been watching over her.

601
00:46:19,062 --> 00:46:22,259
You stay the fuck away from
my family, you son of a bitch.

602
00:46:22,299 --> 00:46:26,292
There's no need for that kind
of language, Mrs. Stall.

603
00:46:26,336 --> 00:46:28,395
Listen to me.
I don't know what you want..

604
00:46:28,438 --> 00:46:29,837
and I don't really care.

605
00:46:29,873 --> 00:46:32,068
You should care about
what I want, Mrs. Stall..

606
00:46:32,109 --> 00:46:34,703
because I want something
from your husband..

607
00:46:34,744 --> 00:46:38,874
that might affect you,
might change your life.

608
00:46:38,915 --> 00:46:41,076
My husband does not know you.

609
00:46:41,118 --> 00:46:43,313
He wouldn't know you,
somebody like you.

610
00:46:43,353 --> 00:46:46,379
Oh, he knows Carl Fogarty,
all right.

611
00:46:46,423 --> 00:46:48,118
He knows me intimately.

612
00:46:49,693 --> 00:46:54,323
See? This isn't
a completely dead eye.

613
00:46:54,364 --> 00:46:56,696
It still works a bit.

614
00:46:56,733 --> 00:46:59,099
The problem is, the only thing
I can see with it..

615
00:46:59,136 --> 00:47:01,502
is Joey Cusack.

616
00:47:01,538 --> 00:47:04,302
And it can see
right through him.

617
00:47:04,341 --> 00:47:06,741
Right through your husband,
Edie.

618
00:47:06,776 --> 00:47:10,735
See what's inside him,
what makes him tick.

619
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:12,873
He's still the same guy.

620
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:17,046
- No.
- He's still crazy fuckin' Joey.

621
00:47:17,087 --> 00:47:18,816
And you know it, don't you?

622
00:47:18,855 --> 00:47:22,347
I know that my husband is
Tom Stall. That's what I know.

623
00:47:22,392 --> 00:47:23,723
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

624
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,388
Well, why don't you ask Tom
about his older brother Richie?

625
00:47:26,429 --> 00:47:27,555
He doesn't..

626
00:47:27,597 --> 00:47:32,057
Ask Tom about how he tried to
rip my eye out with barbed wire.

627
00:47:32,102 --> 00:47:34,434
And ask him, Edie..

628
00:47:34,471 --> 00:47:40,171
how come he's so good
at killing people?

629
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:44,112
If I see you within
five hundred feet of me..

630
00:47:44,147 --> 00:47:46,615
or my children or my husband,
I'll have you arrested.

631
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:47,844
Heh heh heh heh.

632
00:47:47,884 --> 00:47:50,751
Can I possibly make myself
any clearer than that?

633
00:47:50,787 --> 00:47:54,553
No, no, Mrs. Stall, you can't.
I thank you for your time.

634
00:47:54,591 --> 00:47:57,116
You have an enchanting daughter.

635
00:47:58,662 --> 00:48:01,062
And, Mrs. Stall..

636
00:48:01,097 --> 00:48:03,258
don't forget your shoes.

637
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,734
Heh heh heh heh.

638
00:48:05,769 --> 00:48:07,236
So, how's your dad?

639
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:09,761
I don't know. A little weird.

640
00:48:09,806 --> 00:48:11,569
Well, after
what he went through?

641
00:48:11,608 --> 00:48:14,406
I mean,
actually killing someone?

642
00:48:14,444 --> 00:48:17,504
I mean, that's enough
to freak anybody out.

643
00:48:17,547 --> 00:48:20,175
Yeah. I guess.

644
00:48:23,853 --> 00:48:26,321
So, your old man's
some kind of tough guy, huh?

645
00:48:26,356 --> 00:48:28,483
What's he think
of his wimp son?

646
00:48:28,525 --> 00:48:31,619
You think he'd take this shit?
You think he'd make jokes?

647
00:48:31,661 --> 00:48:33,891
Go on, bitch.
Say something funny.

648
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:35,557
Bobby, leave him alone.

649
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:38,295
Shut up, skank.

650
00:48:38,335 --> 00:48:40,963
Uh-oh. He's gettin' mad.

651
00:48:41,004 --> 00:48:43,632
Jack, let's just
get out of here, OK?

652
00:48:44,874 --> 00:48:47,434
Jack, he's an asshole.
You know that.

653
00:48:47,477 --> 00:48:50,002
He doesn't mean shit.
Let's just go.

654
00:48:50,046 --> 00:48:51,911
Let's just get out of here, OK?

655
00:48:51,948 --> 00:48:54,974
Yeah, puss. Run away.

656
00:48:55,018 --> 00:48:58,419
Goddamn, I bet your daddy
would be real ashamed by you.

657
00:48:59,689 --> 00:49:01,748
Go ahead, bitch.
Say something funny.

658
00:49:01,791 --> 00:49:04,453
Make me laugh.

659
00:49:19,342 --> 00:49:22,004
- Uhh!
- Ohh!

660
00:49:22,045 --> 00:49:23,842
Uhh!

661
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:29,318
OK, you motherfucker! Get
over there, you son of a bitch!

662
00:49:29,352 --> 00:49:30,512
Ohh!

663
00:49:30,553 --> 00:49:31,884
Come here. Are you laughin'?

664
00:49:31,921 --> 00:49:33,684
Are you laughin' now..

665
00:49:33,723 --> 00:49:38,285
you motherfucking
cocksucking piece of shit?

666
00:49:43,867 --> 00:49:45,698
What the hell were you thinking?

667
00:49:45,735 --> 00:49:48,898
- I wasn't thinking.
- Obviously not.

668
00:49:48,938 --> 00:49:52,533
Bobby's been riding me
all year, Dad. He's a jerk.

669
00:49:53,777 --> 00:49:54,903
He's a jerk?

670
00:49:54,944 --> 00:49:56,969
Yeah. He's a jerk.

671
00:49:57,013 --> 00:49:59,743
That's no excuse.
You stand up to him.

672
00:49:59,783 --> 00:50:01,410
You don't put him
in the hospital!

673
00:50:01,451 --> 00:50:02,577
Oh, big deal.

674
00:50:02,619 --> 00:50:05,417
It's the best thing
anyone could've done to him.

675
00:50:05,455 --> 00:50:07,252
Besides, I only got suspended.

676
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:09,053
It is a big deal!

677
00:50:09,092 --> 00:50:10,923
His parents say
they might sue us.

678
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,825
There could be assault charges.

679
00:50:12,862 --> 00:50:14,022
We can't afford that, Jack.

680
00:50:14,064 --> 00:50:15,497
We don't have
that kind of money.

681
00:50:15,532 --> 00:50:17,693
Oh, what?
Mom's not gonna take the case?

682
00:50:17,734 --> 00:50:21,670
- Oh, whatever, Dad..
- Listen, smart mouth!

683
00:50:21,705 --> 00:50:24,833
In this family, we do not solve
our problems by hitting people!

684
00:50:24,874 --> 00:50:27,206
No, in this family,
we shoot them!

685
00:50:27,243 --> 00:50:28,369
Ah!

686
00:50:34,784 --> 00:50:36,149
Jack.

687
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:49,563
Honey, have you seen Jack?

688
00:50:53,303 --> 00:50:54,793
What?

689
00:50:55,905 --> 00:50:57,964
What's wrong, baby?

690
00:51:01,778 --> 00:51:04,747
Fogarty and his men
followed us to the mall.

691
00:51:04,781 --> 00:51:06,271
He what?

692
00:51:08,284 --> 00:51:10,809
Call Sam.
Should.. Should we call Sam?

693
00:51:10,854 --> 00:51:12,151
We should call..

694
00:51:12,188 --> 00:51:13,553
I already took care of it,
honey.

695
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:16,150
I already took care of it.
Went down to the courthouse..

696
00:51:16,192 --> 00:51:18,319
got a restraining order.

697
00:51:18,361 --> 00:51:20,420
A lot of good that'll do.

698
00:51:20,463 --> 00:51:23,489
Well, it's something.

699
00:51:23,533 --> 00:51:25,364
At least
we could have him arrested..

700
00:51:25,402 --> 00:51:26,994
if he ever
comes around here again.

701
00:51:29,672 --> 00:51:31,731
You're right.

702
00:51:34,744 --> 00:51:36,507
But I have to tell you
something.

703
00:51:38,348 --> 00:51:39,508
What?

704
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:44,208
This man Fogarty
really believes..

705
00:51:44,254 --> 00:51:48,748
that you're this Joey Cusack.

706
00:51:48,792 --> 00:51:51,784
I mean, the things that
he told me this afternoon..

707
00:51:51,828 --> 00:51:54,353
- What things?
- Things. Just bullshit.

708
00:51:54,397 --> 00:51:59,835
But he's, uh,
he's sure that it's you.

709
00:51:59,869 --> 00:52:02,531
And we have to convince him
that it's not.

710
00:52:02,572 --> 00:52:07,600
Well, I don't think he's
interested in examining my DNA.

711
00:52:28,398 --> 00:52:30,263
Get off our property.

712
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,699
We'll go, Joey.

713
00:52:31,734 --> 00:52:33,725
We just want you
to come with us.

714
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:36,898
Come back to Philly,
see some people.

715
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:40,137
I told you, I have never been
to Philadelphia.

716
00:52:40,176 --> 00:52:43,373
Heh. You almost believe
your own crap, don't you?

717
00:52:43,413 --> 00:52:46,871
You know, you're trying so hard
to be this other guy.

718
00:52:46,916 --> 00:52:48,975
It's painful to watch.

719
00:52:50,787 --> 00:52:53,085
- Charlie.
- Hey.

720
00:52:53,122 --> 00:52:55,522
Look what we found.

721
00:52:55,558 --> 00:52:57,617
Come on.

722
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:58,922
Yeah? Ha ha ha.

723
00:52:58,962 --> 00:53:00,452
- Mom!
- Jack!

724
00:53:00,497 --> 00:53:02,897
- No! Edie! Edie!
- Mom!

725
00:53:02,932 --> 00:53:04,900
- Edie! No! No!
- Jack!

726
00:53:04,934 --> 00:53:06,697
Let go, you son of a bitch!

727
00:53:06,736 --> 00:53:07,998
Come here.

728
00:53:09,939 --> 00:53:11,497
Wait.

729
00:53:11,541 --> 00:53:13,668
Mom.

730
00:53:14,811 --> 00:53:17,211
Don't make us hurt the kid,
Joey.

731
00:53:17,247 --> 00:53:19,545
We just want you to come
for a little trip with us..

732
00:53:19,582 --> 00:53:21,174
down Memory Lane.

733
00:53:21,217 --> 00:53:24,744
Put the popgun down.
Come over and talk to us.

734
00:53:24,787 --> 00:53:26,254
Baby, wait.

735
00:53:26,289 --> 00:53:29,725
Edie.. I will get him.

736
00:53:29,759 --> 00:53:32,523
I'll get him. Please.

737
00:53:32,562 --> 00:53:34,427
Go up to Sarah.

738
00:53:34,464 --> 00:53:37,456
Go up to her. Do it.

739
00:53:45,875 --> 00:53:47,809
Put the gun down.

740
00:53:52,849 --> 00:53:55,409
Put it down, Joey.

741
00:54:00,156 --> 00:54:03,057
Come closer.

742
00:54:08,531 --> 00:54:10,522
A little further.

743
00:54:17,173 --> 00:54:18,572
Come on.

744
00:54:33,056 --> 00:54:35,286
Go back to the house, Jack.

745
00:54:39,028 --> 00:54:40,791
Go on.

746
00:54:50,907 --> 00:54:55,367
You see how cozy it can be
when you decide to play nice?

747
00:54:56,646 --> 00:54:58,876
Now, come on, Joey.
Get in the car.

748
00:54:58,915 --> 00:55:02,180
You won't need your toothbrush.
We'll take care of everything.

749
00:55:02,218 --> 00:55:05,449
I think it'd be better
if you'd just leave now.

750
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,689
Joey.

751
00:55:23,373 --> 00:55:25,341
Come on, Joey, let's go.

752
00:55:30,046 --> 00:55:31,172
Ahh!

753
00:55:31,214 --> 00:55:33,205
- Uhh!
- Uhh! Uhh!

754
00:55:33,249 --> 00:55:34,841
Ohh! Ohh!

755
00:55:38,221 --> 00:55:40,314
Uhh!

756
00:55:40,356 --> 00:55:42,085
Tom!

757
00:55:47,463 --> 00:55:48,987
Fuck.

758
00:55:51,467 --> 00:55:53,094
Mommy, what's wrong?

759
00:56:02,311 --> 00:56:04,006
It's OK.

760
00:56:08,051 --> 00:56:10,713
You got anything to say
before I blow your brains out..

761
00:56:10,753 --> 00:56:12,345
you miserable prick?

762
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:17,582
I should've killed you
back in Philly.

763
00:56:22,865 --> 00:56:25,698
Yeah, Joey.

764
00:56:25,735 --> 00:56:27,862
You should have.

765
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:40,578
Uhh! Uhh.

766
00:58:08,304 --> 00:58:09,999
Edie.

767
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:19,143
Honey, are you OK?

768
00:58:21,284 --> 00:58:23,081
Tell me the truth.

769
00:58:26,088 --> 00:58:27,783
The truth?

770
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:33,795
Please.
You can do that, can't you?

771
00:58:37,233 --> 00:58:40,634
You can do that, can't you?
Please?

772
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:42,900
What do you think you heard?

773
00:58:42,939 --> 00:58:45,874
It's not what I heard.

774
00:58:45,908 --> 00:58:47,500
It's what I saw.

775
00:58:51,581 --> 00:58:54,141
I saw Joey.

776
00:58:54,183 --> 00:58:58,415
I saw you turn into Joey
right before my eyes.

777
00:58:59,689 --> 00:59:03,318
I saw a killer..
the one Fogarty warned me about.

778
00:59:04,827 --> 00:59:09,025
You did kill men
back in Philly, didn't you?

779
00:59:10,933 --> 00:59:12,628
Did you do it for money..

780
00:59:12,668 --> 00:59:14,295
or did you do it
because you enjoyed it?

781
00:59:14,337 --> 00:59:18,398
Joey did, both. I didn't..

782
00:59:18,441 --> 00:59:19,874
Tom Stall didn't.

783
00:59:27,083 --> 00:59:29,415
Oh, God.

784
00:59:29,452 --> 00:59:30,942
Oh, my God.

785
00:59:42,164 --> 00:59:44,155
Oh, God, it's really happening.

786
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,827
Oh.

787
00:59:47,169 --> 00:59:51,572
What are you, like, some
multiple personality schizoid?

788
00:59:51,607 --> 00:59:54,269
It's like flipping a switch
back and forth for you?

789
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:57,006
I never expected
to see Joey again.

790
00:59:57,046 --> 00:59:59,844
Oh, yeah. Joey.

791
00:59:59,882 --> 01:00:01,873
What, was he in hiding?
Was he dead?

792
01:00:01,918 --> 01:00:03,647
I thought he was.

793
01:00:03,686 --> 01:00:05,551
I thought I killed Joey Cusack.

794
01:00:05,588 --> 01:00:07,556
I went out to the desert,
and I killed him.

795
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:08,716
Oh, my God.

796
01:00:08,758 --> 01:00:13,252
I spent three years
becoming Tom Stall.

797
01:00:13,296 --> 01:00:15,321
Edie, you have to know this.

798
01:00:15,364 --> 01:00:18,993
I wasn't really born again
until I met you.

799
01:00:20,236 --> 01:00:22,170
I was nothing.

800
01:00:24,407 --> 01:00:26,705
I don't believe you.

801
01:00:27,977 --> 01:00:29,968
I can't believe
this is happening.

802
01:00:30,012 --> 01:00:31,479
I can't believe
this is happening.

803
01:00:31,514 --> 01:00:35,541
I can't believe
this is fucking happening!

804
01:00:37,353 --> 01:00:39,947
You didn't grow up in Portland.

805
01:00:41,157 --> 01:00:43,182
And you never talk about
your adopted parents..

806
01:00:43,225 --> 01:00:45,625
because you don't have any!

807
01:00:47,363 --> 01:00:48,762
And our name.

808
01:00:48,798 --> 01:00:52,529
Jesus Christ, my name.

809
01:00:52,568 --> 01:00:55,128
Jack's name. Sarah's name?

810
01:00:55,171 --> 01:00:59,665
Stall? Tom Stall?

811
01:01:01,143 --> 01:01:04,044
Did you just make that up?

812
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:06,548
Where did that name come from?

813
01:01:07,850 --> 01:01:09,511
I mean..

814
01:01:11,387 --> 01:01:13,821
it was available.

815
01:01:13,856 --> 01:01:15,323
Yeah.

816
01:01:25,368 --> 01:01:28,132
I guess I was available, too.

817
01:02:09,011 --> 01:02:10,911
Hey, Jack.

818
01:02:13,582 --> 01:02:16,415
What am I supposed
to call you now?

819
01:02:19,522 --> 01:02:21,888
You're supposed to call me Dad.

820
01:02:21,924 --> 01:02:23,585
That's what I am.. your dad.

821
01:02:23,626 --> 01:02:25,093
Are you really?

822
01:02:25,127 --> 01:02:30,064
So, you're some kind of
closet mobster dad?

823
01:02:30,099 --> 01:02:32,294
I mean, if I go rob
Millikan's Drug Store..

824
01:02:32,334 --> 01:02:35,599
will you ground me if I don't
give you a piece of the action?

825
01:02:35,638 --> 01:02:38,163
What, Dad? You tell me.

826
01:02:38,207 --> 01:02:40,437
Please, son. Don't.

827
01:02:40,476 --> 01:02:44,936
If I talk to Sam about you,
will you have me whacked?

828
01:02:48,217 --> 01:02:49,912
Jack.

829
01:03:50,412 --> 01:03:52,505
Tom?

830
01:03:52,548 --> 01:03:54,914
Hey, Sam. How are you doing?

831
01:03:54,950 --> 01:03:56,508
Good to see you up and around.

832
01:03:56,552 --> 01:03:59,680
- Yeah.
- You had her runnin' yet?

833
01:03:59,722 --> 01:04:01,917
Yeah, for a second there.

834
01:04:01,957 --> 01:04:04,448
She's coming back to life.

835
01:04:05,528 --> 01:04:07,393
Ah, shit.

836
01:04:09,765 --> 01:04:10,925
Tom..

837
01:04:12,801 --> 01:04:15,702
I got a problem.

838
01:04:17,439 --> 01:04:19,999
Want to come inside
for a minute?

839
01:04:25,481 --> 01:04:29,076
I've been running through it all
for the last couple days.

840
01:04:32,087 --> 01:04:33,850
It just doesn't fit.

841
01:04:35,357 --> 01:04:37,291
What doesn't fit?

842
01:04:37,326 --> 01:04:38,350
None of it.

843
01:04:43,432 --> 01:04:45,696
Is that Edie coming home?

844
01:04:45,734 --> 01:04:47,565
Yeah.

845
01:04:49,004 --> 01:04:51,905
Well, we don't have
to do this now.

846
01:04:53,242 --> 01:04:55,142
Might as well.

847
01:04:59,982 --> 01:05:02,041
Hi, Sam.

848
01:05:02,084 --> 01:05:03,779
Edie.

849
01:05:03,819 --> 01:05:05,582
How you doing?

850
01:05:05,621 --> 01:05:07,851
I'm OK.

851
01:05:09,625 --> 01:05:11,092
You want some coffee?

852
01:05:11,126 --> 01:05:12,718
No, I'm good.

853
01:05:15,731 --> 01:05:17,426
So, what brings you out here?

854
01:05:17,466 --> 01:05:20,401
Well, Tom and I
were just talking about that.

855
01:05:20,436 --> 01:05:23,769
Mmm. I'd like to hear it.

856
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:27,873
Well, it's just that..

857
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:31,273
none of this makes any sense.

858
01:05:31,313 --> 01:05:33,076
Mmm.

859
01:05:33,115 --> 01:05:34,707
These are serious secretive men.

860
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:35,808
I mean, they wouldn't have
come out here..

861
01:05:35,851 --> 01:05:37,341
they wouldn't have
gone through all this..

862
01:05:37,386 --> 01:05:39,911
exposed themselves like this..

863
01:05:39,955 --> 01:05:42,788
unless they were dead certain
they had the right man.

864
01:05:45,194 --> 01:05:47,424
So, what are you saying, Sam?

865
01:05:50,132 --> 01:05:54,432
I'm saying I think
I need to hear the truth.

866
01:05:55,704 --> 01:05:58,264
The truth?

867
01:06:02,745 --> 01:06:05,441
The truth.

868
01:06:12,821 --> 01:06:16,188
Sam, you've got
too much time on your hands.

869
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:18,485
I'm sorry?

870
01:06:19,962 --> 01:06:22,089
Tom is..

871
01:06:23,832 --> 01:06:25,356
Tom is who he says he is.

872
01:06:25,401 --> 01:06:27,892
That's all that really matters.

873
01:06:27,936 --> 01:06:31,997
Sam, hasn't this family
suffered enough?

874
01:06:35,911 --> 01:06:38,812
Well..

875
01:06:38,847 --> 01:06:40,439
goddamn.

876
01:06:43,719 --> 01:06:45,482
Edie.

877
01:06:45,521 --> 01:06:46,886
It's OK.

878
01:06:49,625 --> 01:06:52,492
I guess I'll be going.

879
01:06:58,801 --> 01:07:01,235
You folks give me a ring
if you need anything.

880
01:07:05,407 --> 01:07:08,808
Anything at all, understand?

881
01:07:19,321 --> 01:07:21,482
Thanks.

882
01:07:23,158 --> 01:07:24,182
You..

883
01:07:25,861 --> 01:07:29,194
Edie. Edie!

884
01:07:29,231 --> 01:07:31,222
- Get off of me!
- Unh!

885
01:07:35,003 --> 01:07:38,131
Fuck you, Joey!

886
01:07:39,608 --> 01:07:41,303
Aah! Get off!

887
01:07:45,981 --> 01:07:47,380
Uhh!

888
01:08:21,016 --> 01:08:22,711
Uhh!

889
01:08:40,135 --> 01:08:41,727
Ohh!

890
01:08:49,711 --> 01:08:51,736
Ohh. Ohh.

891
01:09:05,093 --> 01:09:07,391
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

892
01:09:07,429 --> 01:09:10,921
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

893
01:09:13,435 --> 01:09:14,766
Mmm.

894
01:09:36,792 --> 01:09:38,259
Uhh.

895
01:10:33,282 --> 01:10:34,510
Uhh.

896
01:10:39,755 --> 01:10:41,120
Uhh.

897
01:10:49,364 --> 01:10:50,763
Hello.

898
01:10:50,799 --> 01:10:53,290
Hey, bro-ham.

899
01:10:53,335 --> 01:10:56,236
You're still pretty good
with the killing.

900
01:10:56,271 --> 01:10:58,205
That's exciting.

901
01:10:59,274 --> 01:11:00,605
Richie.

902
01:11:00,642 --> 01:11:04,476
Yeah, it's Richie.
What do you say, Joey?

903
01:11:04,513 --> 01:11:06,504
Are you going to come see me?

904
01:11:06,548 --> 01:11:08,880
Or do I have to come see you?

905
01:13:38,567 --> 01:13:39,829
What's that supposed to mean?

906
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:47,204
Uh, Jenny Cream.

907
01:13:47,242 --> 01:13:49,210
Bottle.

908
01:14:29,985 --> 01:14:31,953
You Ruben?

909
01:14:31,987 --> 01:14:34,217
Yeah.

910
01:14:34,256 --> 01:14:35,450
You Joey?

911
01:14:46,668 --> 01:14:48,795
Yeah, I'm Joey.

912
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:53,701
So, what do we do now?

913
01:14:56,511 --> 01:14:58,706
You finish your beer..

914
01:14:58,747 --> 01:15:01,307
then I take you to see Richie
in the Escalade.

915
01:15:22,470 --> 01:15:25,439
Nice houses.

916
01:15:25,473 --> 01:15:28,636
Richie's
a very upscale kind of guy.

917
01:15:44,926 --> 01:15:46,757
Nice gate.

918
01:15:46,795 --> 01:15:48,922
Yeah.

919
01:16:21,997 --> 01:16:23,362
We're here.

920
01:16:24,432 --> 01:16:27,026
Home, sweet home.

921
01:16:56,698 --> 01:16:58,825
Got to frisk you.

922
01:16:58,867 --> 01:17:00,835
Nah. I'll save you the trouble.

923
01:17:00,869 --> 01:17:02,097
I'm not packing.

924
01:17:03,939 --> 01:17:05,167
I got to frisk you.

925
01:17:08,009 --> 01:17:09,943
All right.

926
01:17:09,978 --> 01:17:11,775
I don't smell very good.

927
01:17:11,813 --> 01:17:13,872
I've been driving
pretty much non-stop..

928
01:17:13,915 --> 01:17:16,145
fifteen to sixteen hours.

929
01:17:16,184 --> 01:17:18,414
I'll hold my nose.

930
01:17:29,864 --> 01:17:32,662
Can you believe that place
is still standing..

931
01:17:32,701 --> 01:17:34,931
the Track and Turf?

932
01:17:41,543 --> 01:17:43,704
Didn't you bang
Jill Levy there..

933
01:17:43,745 --> 01:17:46,339
right on the bar
in front of everybody?

934
01:17:46,381 --> 01:17:49,009
I never banged Jill Levy.

935
01:17:50,352 --> 01:17:55,517
Well, you should've.
She was.. She was something.

936
01:18:04,065 --> 01:18:06,693
How you doing, Richie?

937
01:18:10,772 --> 01:18:13,104
Mmm.

938
01:18:26,121 --> 01:18:27,611
Yeah.

939
01:18:27,655 --> 01:18:30,954
It's been a long, long time,
bro-ham.

940
01:18:41,469 --> 01:18:43,937
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

941
01:18:43,972 --> 01:18:46,236
Come with me.

942
01:18:58,753 --> 01:19:01,847
- You want anything?
- Nah.

943
01:19:06,828 --> 01:19:09,695
So, you like that farm life?

944
01:19:11,099 --> 01:19:13,499
Milking cows and shit?

945
01:19:13,535 --> 01:19:16,595
I don't have a farm.

946
01:19:16,638 --> 01:19:18,731
No?

947
01:19:18,773 --> 01:19:22,834
Fogarty thought you lived
on some kind of farm.

948
01:19:24,412 --> 01:19:28,405
Said you could smell pig.

949
01:19:28,450 --> 01:19:30,475
How that old fart would know..

950
01:19:30,518 --> 01:19:31,883
what a pig smells like,
I don't know..

951
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:33,080
but that's what he said.

952
01:19:37,826 --> 01:19:39,794
Ahem.

953
01:19:39,828 --> 01:19:41,853
Do you like being married?

954
01:19:41,896 --> 01:19:43,659
What?

955
01:19:43,698 --> 01:19:45,791
Do you like being married?

956
01:19:47,569 --> 01:19:50,333
Does it work for you?

957
01:19:50,371 --> 01:19:53,238
I can't see it working for me.

958
01:19:53,274 --> 01:19:55,538
I never felt the urge, you know?

959
01:19:55,577 --> 01:19:58,444
A lot of great looking women
in the world.

960
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:02,849
I never met one made me
want to give up all the others.

961
01:20:02,884 --> 01:20:04,476
Sure, you can fuck around..

962
01:20:04,519 --> 01:20:06,919
but it's so much goddamn work,
you know?

963
01:20:06,955 --> 01:20:09,014
Keeping it quiet.

964
01:20:09,057 --> 01:20:11,082
It's not worth the effort.

965
01:20:12,627 --> 01:20:14,117
Don't see the upside.

966
01:20:14,162 --> 01:20:16,926
You see the upside, Joey?

967
01:20:17,999 --> 01:20:20,433
Yeah, Richie, I do.

968
01:20:21,803 --> 01:20:23,668
I do now.

969
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:29,442
I'm pretty pissed at you,
bro-ham.

970
01:20:30,845 --> 01:20:32,938
You could've called.

971
01:20:32,981 --> 01:20:38,009
You could've dropped a postcard
in the mail.

972
01:20:38,052 --> 01:20:41,021
We're brothers.
What'd you think would happen?

973
01:20:54,736 --> 01:20:57,864
I thought that business
would come first.

974
01:20:57,906 --> 01:20:59,806
Well, yeah.

975
01:21:00,842 --> 01:21:03,310
Yeah, I know.

976
01:21:03,344 --> 01:21:06,142
Tch. I know.

977
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:10,609
What am I going to do?

978
01:21:10,652 --> 01:21:13,712
You bust up a made man's place.

979
01:21:13,755 --> 01:21:15,814
You killed some of his guys.

980
01:21:15,857 --> 01:21:18,325
You take his eye.

981
01:21:18,359 --> 01:21:22,022
Jesus, Joey, you took his eye.

982
01:21:22,063 --> 01:21:24,861
Barbed wire, wasn't it?

983
01:21:24,899 --> 01:21:28,460
That's disgusting.
You always were the crazy one.

984
01:21:28,503 --> 01:21:31,472
- Not anymore.
- Yeah, I heard.

985
01:21:31,506 --> 01:21:33,098
You're living
the American dream.

986
01:21:33,141 --> 01:21:35,109
You really bought into it,
didn't you?

987
01:21:35,143 --> 01:21:37,043
You've been this other guy..

988
01:21:37,078 --> 01:21:40,377
almost as long
as you've been yourself.

989
01:21:43,318 --> 01:21:47,311
Hey, when you dream..

990
01:21:47,355 --> 01:21:50,791
are you still Joey?

991
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:54,221
Joey's been dead a long time.

992
01:21:54,262 --> 01:21:56,526
And yet here you sit..

993
01:21:57,732 --> 01:21:59,529
big as life.

994
01:22:02,503 --> 01:22:04,596
You know you cost me..

995
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:08,097
a lot of time and money.

996
01:22:08,142 --> 01:22:10,702
Before you pulled that shit
with Fogarty..

997
01:22:10,745 --> 01:22:13,339
I was a shoe-in to take over..

998
01:22:13,381 --> 01:22:16,976
when the boss croaked..
a shoe-in.

999
01:22:17,018 --> 01:22:19,816
It was made very clear to me,
Joey.

1000
01:22:19,854 --> 01:22:22,288
I had to clean up your mess..

1001
01:22:22,323 --> 01:22:25,690
or nothing was ever
going to happen for me.

1002
01:22:25,727 --> 01:22:29,686
You got no idea
how much shit I had to pull..

1003
01:22:29,731 --> 01:22:32,894
to get back in with those guys.

1004
01:22:34,769 --> 01:22:37,397
You cost me..

1005
01:22:39,574 --> 01:22:43,635
a hell of a lot, Joey,
a hell of a lot.

1006
01:22:45,413 --> 01:22:48,382
Looks like you're doing
all right over here.

1007
01:22:48,416 --> 01:22:52,011
Yeah, I am, I am.

1008
01:22:52,053 --> 01:22:56,422
I'm still behind
the eightball..

1009
01:22:56,457 --> 01:22:58,288
because of you.

1010
01:22:58,326 --> 01:23:00,317
There's a certain
lack of respect..

1011
01:23:00,361 --> 01:23:02,886
a certain lack of trust.

1012
01:23:05,433 --> 01:23:09,426
The boys in Boston are
just waiting for me to go down.

1013
01:23:14,509 --> 01:23:18,172
You always were
a problem for me, Joey.

1014
01:23:18,212 --> 01:23:20,544
When Mom brought you home
from the hospital..

1015
01:23:20,581 --> 01:23:23,345
I tried to strangle you
in your crib.

1016
01:23:23,384 --> 01:23:26,751
I guess all kids try to do that.

1017
01:23:26,788 --> 01:23:28,756
She caught me..

1018
01:23:28,790 --> 01:23:32,089
whacked the daylights out of me.

1019
01:23:32,126 --> 01:23:34,856
I've heard that story.

1020
01:23:38,132 --> 01:23:40,794
Well, what do you think?

1021
01:23:45,073 --> 01:23:47,337
Better late than never?

1022
01:23:47,375 --> 01:23:49,138
Richie..

1023
01:23:51,045 --> 01:23:53,946
I'm here to make peace.

1024
01:23:53,981 --> 01:23:57,747
Tell me what I got to do
to make things right.

1025
01:23:59,454 --> 01:24:02,116
You could do something, I guess.

1026
01:24:07,228 --> 01:24:09,924
You could die, Joey.

1027
01:24:28,015 --> 01:24:29,312
Ooh!

1028
01:24:31,753 --> 01:24:33,380
Uhh!

1029
01:24:33,421 --> 01:24:34,581
Uhh!

1030
01:24:34,622 --> 01:24:36,317
- Unh!
- Oh!

1031
01:24:40,428 --> 01:24:42,453
Oh!

1032
01:24:42,497 --> 01:24:43,725
Uhh!

1033
01:24:45,666 --> 01:24:47,998
Uhh! Ohh!

1034
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:07,915
How do you fuck that up?

1035
01:25:08,956 --> 01:25:10,082
Uhh!

1036
01:25:10,124 --> 01:25:14,151
How do you fuck that up?

1037
01:25:31,779 --> 01:25:34,475
What are you going to do,
give him mouth-to-mouth?

1038
01:25:34,515 --> 01:25:37,211
Did you see my brother?

1039
01:25:37,251 --> 01:25:38,479
Fuckin' leave this..

1040
01:25:38,519 --> 01:25:42,216
and let's just kill
that little fuck!

1041
01:26:43,818 --> 01:26:46,218
Jesus, Joey.

1042
01:27:09,343 --> 01:27:11,675
Jesus, Richie.

1043
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:48,400
