1
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:07,606
Well, you know
what they say.

2
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:09,308
Once you pass 40,
you got to choose

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,610
between your ass
and your face.

4
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:14,179
Wait, I'm sorry.
So you're saying my ass...

5
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,647
After 40,
you have to choose

6
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:17,416
between your ass
and your face.

7
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:20,019
If you get too skinny,
your face gets craggy...

8
00:00:22,156 --> 00:00:23,789
'Cause it's just,
like... it's all I do.

9
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:26,058
My kids are like,
"Where's Mom?"

10
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,459
I'm going ass.

11
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,395
I'll just let the face
fall apart.

12
00:00:29,397 --> 00:00:31,063
It's like the fountain
of youth kind of thing.

13
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:33,032
Six-pack abs,
which I...

14
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:34,433
I feel like
I've passed the window

15
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:36,402
where I could get
fake tits.

16
00:00:36,404 --> 00:00:39,104
I wouldn't let anybody
shoot anything into my face.

17
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:41,173
I just want
to be old and ugly.

18
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:14,867
- Are you OK?
- I'm sorry!

19
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:16,502
I didn't mean to hit you.

20
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,373
Mom, I'm sorry.

21
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,442
Ow...

22
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:25,744
It was you
who screwed me over.

23
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:27,412
No, don't...
don't give me that...

24
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:28,647
It's my last hoodie
without paint on it.

25
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,649
Just get in.
Jesus Christ!

26
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,551
You're just trying
to not get in trouble.

27
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:34,453
- It was not...
- It wasn't my fault.

28
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:36,588
I was trying to throw to Mayer,
but then she got in the way.

29
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,590
- So annoying!
- I hate you.

30
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,325
I wish you weren't even
my brother.

31
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,361
Shut up, you little shit!

32
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:44,763
What are you... What did you
think was gonna happen?

33
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:47,299
What do you think is gonna
happen if you throw
a ball at my head?

34
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:48,567
And then this
is what's gonna happen!

35
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:49,868
It's OK.

36
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,204
It just goes and goes!

37
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:53,305
I hate this.

38
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,843
I don't want this.
I don't want it.

39
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,345
I don't want it.
I don't want this.

40
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,883
Oh, it's awful.

41
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,657
Don't you think you were
a little rough on the kids?

42
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,365
I'm going back to work.

43
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,269
I mean it.

44
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:17,723
It's about the things
we dream about
when we first have kids.

45
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:19,725
The article is about
all the crazy hormones

46
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:21,293
and the stuff we dream,

47
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:23,829
so I'm going to call
all of your stories...

48
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:26,798
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

49
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
All right, let me see.

50
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,639
Oh, no.

51
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:35,741
- It's awful.
- That's bad.

52
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:36,975
I don't know what to say.

53
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,977
It could not be any worse.

54
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,746
You are an asshole.

55
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:42,648
- I know. I'm sorry.
- My God.

56
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,483
Can you still drive?

57
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:45,684
Oh, I'll get him.

58
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,319
Relax.
I will pick them up.

59
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:48,620
Good,
because my deadline's Tuesday.

60
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,329
- Hi, Sam.
- Hi, Abby.

61
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,032
Hi, Mommy.

62
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:02,868
Mrs. Ableman,
can I speak to you for a minute?

63
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,538
The holiday's coming,
and...

64
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,006
Do you celebrate that?

65
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,475
Halloween?

66
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,344
Well, last year,

67
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:15,414
a mother took me to task
for inciting paganism,

68
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,516
so I just never know
anymore.

69
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:21,520
I call every holiday
"holiday basket time,"

70
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:25,090
so it's holiday basket time,
and we need candy.

71
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:27,526
It can be wrapped
in black or orange,

72
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:29,861
a jack-o'-lantern on it
or a cat.

73
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:32,364
You might want to leave
the witches out of it.

74
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:34,433
Is that a problem?

75
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:36,535
No.

76
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,909
All right. So...

77
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:45,744
"When Jake was born,
I used to dream

78
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:47,846
someone put him
in the microwave.

79
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,482
It was hard
to be close to him.

80
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:52,084
I'd have Kate put him away
in his crib,

81
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:54,886
and then I'd dream
he was in the microwave.

82
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:57,856
He was so tiny,
I'd feel sorry for him."

83
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,891
Were you drunk
when you wrote this?

84
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:04,096
"And then sometimes,
I'd dream he was married to me.

85
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:05,831
My poor baby.

86
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:06,965
I didn't know whether to
kill him,

87
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:08,900
fuck him,
or eat him."

88
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:16,875
I don't know if this is really
for a parenting magazine.

89
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:21,646
OK, I was more
looking for like,

90
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:24,383
"I dreamt
I forgot to feed him

91
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:26,752
because my concern for my child
is so caught up

92
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:29,821
in the whole
feeding and management thing."

93
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:33,458
And then maybe
a spa tip like,

94
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,394
"Before bed, I used to rub
essential oils on my temples,

95
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:36,962
and then the dreams
went away

96
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:38,730
because there was bergamot
in it,

97
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,132
and bergamot is great
for relieving stress."

98
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,935
Who else is contributing
to this?

99
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:46,037
Uh, Sarah did this one.
It's funny.

100
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,672
And Sam Bennet is doing one.

101
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,708
She's cute... Sam.

102
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,579
Mm-kay.

103
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,415
Sam Bennet
is not a lesbian.

104
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,483
Her husband works
for Goldman Sachs.

105
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,719
He's an analyst.
Her kids are on
the lacrosse team.

106
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:02,621
She's cute.
That's all.

107
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,557
It's like...

108
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,727
I need this in by Tuesday.

109
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,562
Fine.

110
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:12,197
I dreamt
I forgot to feed him.

111
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,905
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hi.

112
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:21,506
Hey.

113
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:22,541
How's your face, babe?

114
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:24,176
Still hazy.

115
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,579
Oh, boy.

116
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:28,847
That red is really starting
to come out.

117
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,916
- It wasn't my fault.
- It's OK.

118
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:33,151
Where are the napkins?
Mayer, would you set the table,
please?

119
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:34,886
OK.

120
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:36,188
Look, Mommy,
can I show you...?

121
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,623
I got to hold
a baby chick today.

122
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,792
- A baby chick?
-  - Can I show you my homework?

123
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,194
Jake, let me just...
I got to take this call.

124
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:43,161
Hello?

125
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:44,596
Uh-huh.

126
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,200
Yeah.

127
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:49,868
Yeah, make it 10:00.

128
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,203
Great.

129
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:54,739
It's so lofty.
It's so airy.

130
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,912
The condo's fine,

131
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:03,715
but they want
a ten-day cash close,

132
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:04,983
and there's no flip fee.

133
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,552
Hey, Jamie.
Boss.

134
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:13,158
A shit hole.
Good job.

135
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,659
Come and look
at the kitchen.

136
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,961
It's gonna be amazing.

137
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:27,839
- Hi.
-  <i>Hey. I'm late.</i>

138
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,841
<i>There's a call in ten minutes,</i>
<i>and then I'll head home.</i>

139
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,676
-  <i>I'm so sorry.</i>
<i>- Is that Mom?</i>

140
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,144
Yes, I'm on the phone.

141
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:35,080
<i>It was supposed to be</i>
<i>a half hour ago.</i>

142
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:36,982
- Oh, is she coming home?
- She's working.

143
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:38,984
Honey, please do screens
or clean your room.

144
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:41,653
- I have to talk to Mommy.
- I'm hungry.

145
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:43,522
I will feed you soon.

146
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:44,823
Tell Mommy I'm hungry.

147
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:47,092
He's very hungry.

148
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:49,194
- <i>Got it.</i>
<i>- I told her.</i>

149
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:52,130
She knows that you are hungry,
OK?

150
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,834
So I'm gonna close
on that place.

151
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:58,270
- <i>Really?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

152
00:08:58,272 --> 00:08:59,738
<i>OK, good.</i>

153
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,840
I have to do something.

154
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,711
<i>- It'll be a good project.</i>
<i>- Right.</i>

155
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,580
<i>And Justin can do</i>
<i>all of it himself.</i>

156
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:11,883
<i>It's not a difficult space.</i>

157
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,685
<i>I think I can finish</i>
<i>in a couple of months.</i>

158
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,720
Oh...

159
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,557
Do you need me to get you
some garbage bags?

160
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,158
No, I got it on the list
already.

161
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,192
OK.

162
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:22,794
Um...

163
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:25,764
You can keep up
with things around here,

164
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:27,299
keep a clean site?

165
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:29,134
Yeah.

166
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:31,670
I just don't want
to have to clean up two houses.

167
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:36,641
Um, you're gonna work
every day?

168
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,176
I won't.

169
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:40,579
So...

170
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:43,148
Can you not smoke?

171
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,150
Thanks.

172
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,085
Huh?

173
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,940
<i>- Hello.</i>
<i>- Hi.</i>

174
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:25,810
<i>Um, I got your number...</i>
<i>I'm...</i>

175
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:27,879
<i>First, let me make</i>
<i>sure this is the right number.</i>

176
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:31,750
<i>Yeah, it's me.</i>
<i>Did you see my ad?</i>

177
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,087
Hi.

178
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,390
- Hi.
- I'm Jenny. Come in.

179
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:40,391
How's it going?

180
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:41,526
Good.

181
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,061
Yeah?

182
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:52,437
So you party a little bit,
or, uh...

183
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,905
Do I party?

184
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:55,540
Um...

185
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,312
Me and you are gonna party
a little bit, OK?

186
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:12,791
You want me to fuck you
with the dildo?

187
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:15,426
What are my other choices?

188
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:17,095
Can we take care
of business first

189
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:20,331
and then have some fun?

190
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,133
Yeah.

191
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,078
Hey, relax.

192
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,446
Want some?

193
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:37,382
I have to pick something
up later.

194
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:39,217
Um...

195
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,553
You sure?

196
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:43,221
Oops.
You got something on your...

197
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:45,190
Yeah, I'm...

198
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:48,593
I need to drive.

199
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:50,995
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

200
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,425
Shit.

201
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:56,628
<i>This legislation is based upon</i>

202
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,030
<i>the Cut Energy Bills</i>
<i>at Home Act</i>

203
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:02,133
<i>and has the potential ability</i>
<i>to be transformative.</i>

204
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:04,469
<i>And I hope that with</i>
<i>going forward with this tax...</i>

205
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,242
You're, like, a swinger,
right?

206
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,543
What?

207
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:14,646
With your girlfriend?

208
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:17,148
I really don't think
it's called that anymore.

209
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,050
Wasn't good, huh?

210
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:20,218
No, it was fine, you know?

211
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,920
We went to a couple of parties,

212
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:25,156
but I'm not with her anymore.

213
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:26,391
What happened to her?

214
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:27,692
She's around.

215
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:29,027
We're friends.

216
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,128
OK.

217
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,563
Here, put more on.

218
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:34,933
I did something.

219
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,077
Smooth, all right?

220
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,378
OK?

221
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,180
Smooth.

222
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:51,616
If you're gonna do it,
don't fuck it up.

223
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:59,090
I think it would be selfish
for me to tell Kate.

224
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:11,202
Was it once?

225
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:13,271
Yeah.

226
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:15,139
What do you two have set up?

227
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:17,041
What do you...
what do you mean?

228
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:18,676
Well, what's the deal?

229
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:20,979
I don't...

230
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:22,513
Do you have, like, an unspoken
kind of thing, you know?

231
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:24,615
Like, "Go off,"

232
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:26,584
or, "Go off, but just don't
tell me about it," you know?

233
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:29,053
It's, like, an arrangement,
you know?

234
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,057
No.

235
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,626
Was it a guy?

236
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,564
Whew.

237
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:41,532
Uh, well, are you gonna
see her again?

238
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,501
That is not possible.

239
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,703
Why?

240
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:47,505
She was...

241
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:53,344
This very dirty person.

242
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,413
She had this odd...

243
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:58,016
It was like she hadn't bathe...
you know, it was...

244
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:01,252
And she wanted me
to do her drugs.

245
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:03,354
I didn't want to do her drugs,
and she was...

246
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:10,128
She made me turn around,
and then she...

247
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:14,432
pushed my head, sort of,
down.

248
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,370
A hooker pushed your head down.

249
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,141
Gross.

250
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,750
Please stop it.

251
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:36,687
Stop it.

252
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:37,789
Hey!

253
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,824
Stop. Stop!

254
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:42,560
- Cut it out.
- Stop!

255
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,128
Stop!

256
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,364
Stop!

257
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:52,670
It's making a buzzing sound.

258
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,442
Ah!

259
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:59,310
Thank you.

260
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:01,712
So, um...

261
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:04,248
I met someone last night.

262
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,783
Her name is Gretchen.

263
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:07,552
If you want to...

264
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:09,420
What is this?

265
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,656
She's supposed to be better.

266
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:17,628
Oh...

267
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:33,211
I don't know
if I like Fabiano.

268
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:35,880
Cuts the grass so high
it never looks done.

269
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,852
Can I be excused?

270
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:42,320
Yes.

271
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:43,321
Me too?

272
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:45,523
Yep.

273
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,796
Mayer,
let's go downstairs.

274
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:52,830
Yeah, let's go.

275
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,665
So Sarah...

276
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,202
What?

277
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:01,739
They're splitting up.

278
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,875
- Surprise.
- Yeah.

279
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,645
She can call me.
I won't charge her.

280
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,747
Really?

281
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,582
So who cheated?

282
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,484
I don't know.

283
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,620
Who gets custody?

284
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:18,890
I assume her.

285
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:20,658
Who gets the house?

286
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,760
They're selling it.

287
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,862
Is he paying her alimony?

288
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:26,364
I don't know
any of these things.

289
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:27,632
What are they gonna do
about Penny?

290
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:29,267
- The dog?
- Yeah.

291
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:30,468
I don't know.

292
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,870
Don't they have another house?

293
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:39,277
She said she couldn't breathe.

294
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,579
That's code for what?

295
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,917
She couldn't breathe.

296
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,956
So she should go breathe.

297
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,424
It's sex. Grow up.

298
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:54,892
Go breathe.

299
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,386
Hi, I'm Gretchen.

300
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:27,959
You're so pretty.

301
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:31,796
Wow.

302
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:33,231
Look at you.

303
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,432
You look...

304
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:35,700
You look amazing.

305
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:37,635
You're just saying that.

306
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:40,438
Oh, you're funny.

307
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,876
I'm gonna get you off.

308
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:50,381
Is that OK?

309
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:51,916
Yeah, I guess.

310
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:54,952
How long has it been?

311
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,357
Um...

312
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,996
Oh, my God.

313
00:21:04,998 --> 00:21:06,998
What a waste.

314
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:23,347
Can I touch you?

315
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:25,516
Yeah.

316
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:01,986
Oh.

317
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:22,433
How long
have you been doing this?

318
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:24,068
A while.

319
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,772
I like working for The Girl.

320
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:30,908
She's super great.

321
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,477
I'm paying my way
through school.

322
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:35,679
Who's The Girl?

323
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:39,016
Oh, um, she's dating Justin.

324
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:40,651
Oh.

325
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,089
And, uh, why does she
not have a name?

326
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:50,094
She does.

327
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:52,096
Oh.

328
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:56,467
So do you want
to see me again?

329
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:57,935
Oh, uh...

330
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,470
Uh...

331
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:01,071
Uh, gosh.

332
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:04,642
Uh, I do, but it was
a bit of a splurge.

333
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,013
Too bad.

334
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:15,052
You know, you didn't
have to make me come.

335
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:17,922
Did I really?
I made... made you...?

336
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:19,757
You didn't have to.

337
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:23,561
I like that.

338
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,012
- Hi.
- Wow, come in.

339
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:44,181
- You're here early. Awesome.
- Yeah.

340
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:45,816
Are these the artichokes?

341
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,518
Yeah, we roasted them
for five hours.

342
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,521
Oh, looks great.

343
00:24:50,523 --> 00:24:52,223
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

344
00:24:52,225 --> 00:24:53,591
Here, go on.

345
00:24:53,593 --> 00:24:54,892
I'll get you a check.

346
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:59,263
I remember waking up
in the morning on a Sunday

347
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:00,831
and having sawdust in my hair
and being like...

348
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,600
- Yeah.
- You remember that?

349
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:04,602
"Oh, I was at Robots
last night."

350
00:25:04,604 --> 00:25:06,704
Do you remember that?
It was all over the floor.

351
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:09,673
That place was crazy.
We were all so freakin' high.

352
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:12,076
I remember standing...
I was standing in a line

353
00:25:12,078 --> 00:25:14,044
for the unisex bathroom
behind a drag queen, right?

354
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:15,746
And we're like,
"Oh, hi. How you doing?

355
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:16,780
You're so sexy.
What's going on?"

356
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:18,082
And he, like,
finger-bangs me.

357
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:19,149
- What?
- Oh, wow.

358
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:21,118
- Yes!
- Right?

359
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,953
Wait, OK, so Don Hill's
on Thursday night...

360
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:24,755
- Squeezebox...
- I loved that place.

361
00:25:24,757 --> 00:25:27,625
- Do you remember?
- The Pussy Den...

362
00:25:27,627 --> 00:25:29,026
- Huh?
- Clit Cat, Clit Club...

363
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,261
- What?
- What was it called?

364
00:25:30,263 --> 00:25:31,228
It was ridiculous.

365
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:34,999
As if anybody wants to admit
that they actually went

366
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:36,934
to Limelight
every single Saturday night.

367
00:25:36,936 --> 00:25:38,602
- Sure, sure.
- Limelight was so...

368
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:39,270
I remember Kenny K at the door.

369
00:25:39,272 --> 00:25:41,038
- Yes.
- Right?

370
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,740
If you didn't have
the right shoes on,

371
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:44,208
he wouldn't let you in.

372
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,709
I learned to give
the best blow jobs

373
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:46,977
in the bathroom
at that place.

374
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:49,179
She did. She did.

375
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:50,314
No, it's true.
She really did.

376
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,918
They're awesome.
They're totally awesome.

377
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,819
Shush!

378
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:57,755
I was surprised
that I hadn't taken it yet,

379
00:25:57,757 --> 00:26:00,691
but I finally took
the Myers-Briggs.

380
00:26:00,693 --> 00:26:02,760
I took that.
Yeah.

381
00:26:02,762 --> 00:26:05,829
I am an ENTP.

382
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:07,031
Basically, an overachiever.

383
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:09,567
Well, not surprising.

384
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:11,969
When you took it, didn't you
find yourself sort of trying
to influence where...

385
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:14,672
Well, it is very hard
to answer those questions
honestly because...

386
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:18,676
- Hello, Mrs. Ableman.
- Hello, Mrs. Ableman.

387
00:26:18,678 --> 00:26:19,777
I love you.

388
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:21,278
You did so good, babe.

389
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,014
Really, I was thinking
the food was just OK.

390
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:25,716
- No, hon, it was good.
- OK.

391
00:26:25,718 --> 00:26:27,651
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm sorry.

392
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:29,253
- I'm interrupting your...
- It's all right.

393
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:30,321
OK. Enjoy.

394
00:26:30,323 --> 00:26:31,889
OK. Bye.

395
00:26:31,891 --> 00:26:33,157
Anyway, it was.

396
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:34,358
It was hard
to answer them honestly.

397
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,834
<i>Thank you for this.</i>

398
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:45,069
<i>I could not lift it up</i>
<i>on my own.</i>

399
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:46,103
<i>It's OK.</i>

400
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:48,339
It's OK.

401
00:26:48,341 --> 00:26:51,041
Nice. Thank you.

402
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:53,010
So I was out
with The Girl last night.

403
00:26:53,012 --> 00:26:54,678
Ran into Gretchen.

404
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,214
- OK, OK.
- She's really hot.

405
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:59,049
Yes.

406
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:01,385
She was unexpected.

407
00:27:01,387 --> 00:27:04,788
She said she thought you were
a really hot dyke housewife.

408
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,624
With $800.

409
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,294
I'm not saying this,
but she said this.

410
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:13,230
She said she thought
you could go out on a few jobs.

411
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:16,000
She said she's got people
from time to time,

412
00:27:16,002 --> 00:27:20,137
younger women who are, like,
you know, rich-rich,

413
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:24,108
and they're looking
for a more mature situation.

414
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,143
Right, like
a married-with-kids

415
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,678
mature situation?

416
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,646
- Yes.
- OK.

417
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:33,083
These are young women
with their fathers' credit cards

418
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:35,085
who like buying stuff.

419
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:40,658
And you want them to buy me?

420
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,093
So?

421
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:45,062
You buy them,
they buy you.

422
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:47,398
What's the difference?

423
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,134
You'd be my what?

424
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:51,335
Mm...

425
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:54,271
Let's not, you know?

426
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:56,273
I'm your guy
who sets things up.

427
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:59,143
Mm-hmm.

428
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:03,280
What would you get?

429
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:05,282
Get a couple hundred.

430
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:07,751
Why?

431
00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:11,021
I set it up,
and you go to their place.

432
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,824
You want me to go
to people's houses?

433
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:15,693
Or not.

434
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:58,402
I think my hooker name
should be Eleanor.

435
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:00,337
My dick just shrank.

436
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:03,407
That your nana's name
or something?

437
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:06,376
I'd like to meet
the clients first.

438
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:09,113
What?

439
00:29:09,115 --> 00:29:11,181
You're gonna meet them here.

440
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:14,418
I'm not gonna
bring a stranger here.

441
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,287
Two-by-sixes for the backsplash
but in that color.

442
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:18,789
Here you go.

443
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:21,325
The Girl's checked them out
already.

444
00:29:21,327 --> 00:29:24,528
Yes, I understand that,
and I would expect The Girl

445
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,530
would have some controls
in place.

446
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:30,467
I would just like to,
you know, meet them first.

447
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:32,436
Where would you like
to meet them first,

448
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:33,837
Nordstrom's?

449
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:36,106
Coffee would be fine.

450
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:38,308
Oh, you'd like
to have coffee first.

451
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,944
Or tea.

452
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:50,921
I thought I was very specific
about saying

453
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:54,258
I wanted my tweezers
to stay in the tweezer hole.

454
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,030
Apparently no one
was listening to me.

455
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:28,592
- Abby.
- No way. Uh-uh.

456
00:30:28,594 --> 00:30:29,927
<i>Uh-uh.</i>

457
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:33,063
All right.
Then come back.

458
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:34,565
Or you want me
to give you a push?

459
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:36,834
The first one is a child.

460
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:38,836
<i>What?</i>

461
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:41,071
She looks like a mean child.

462
00:30:41,073 --> 00:30:42,539
She is sitting down,
highlighting things.

463
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:44,541
She's doing her homework.

464
00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:46,910
You know what, then?
Just forget it.

465
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:50,113
Take me through this,
because this one with a binder
is terrifying.

466
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:51,949
Just forget it
because it doesn't matter.

467
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:53,851
There's another one tomorrow.

468
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:03,126
Hi.

469
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:05,128
Want to tell me
what you're doing in school?

470
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:10,167
Next we're gonna study
on the Dominican Republic.

471
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:13,370
It's a very interesting country.

472
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,339
They grow crops.

473
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:20,210
Do you know Dominicans
eat lunch for two hours?

474
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:22,246
So I come back
for two more of these?

475
00:31:22,248 --> 00:31:23,480
Yep.

476
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:25,349
Enjoy your trip,
Mrs. Ableman.

477
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,570
I don't really know
why I'm here.

478
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:49,606
Is this usually
how it goes?

479
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:52,009
Yes.
Yes.

480
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:56,179
It's not a date, right?

481
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:58,582
Uh, it's kind of a date.

482
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:02,286
But I pay, right?

483
00:32:02,288 --> 00:32:05,389
Why don't you tell me
about you?

484
00:32:05,391 --> 00:32:10,160
Well, I'm in this basic
women's studies class at NYU.

485
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:13,030
We have to do this exercise
at the beginning of every class.

486
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:16,199
We have to draw ourselves,

487
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:18,502
our, um...

488
00:32:18,504 --> 00:32:20,304
Oh, uh-huh.

489
00:32:20,306 --> 00:32:24,508
And then we have to talk
about it.

490
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:28,145
Ah, you brought
a little folder too.

491
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:30,080
I don't...
I don't have to take it out.

492
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:34,084
Maybe you could
just explain it.

493
00:32:34,086 --> 00:32:35,319
OK.

494
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:37,321
Well...

495
00:32:37,323 --> 00:32:42,960
I drew my vagina here,

496
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:48,532
and then I drew a hole here

497
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:51,168
with stars around it,

498
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:56,239
and then I drew a target
for the target,

499
00:32:56,241 --> 00:33:00,444
and then above the stars,
I drew, like, a bubble.

500
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:04,314
It's like a force field,

501
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:09,019
because I'm 23,
and I've never been with anyone.

502
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:10,721
I've never slept with anyone,

503
00:33:10,723 --> 00:33:14,358
and I've never even been kissed.

504
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,694
Sometimes, I...

505
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:21,031
I worry...

506
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:27,137
That I think about that.

507
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,523
Is this your apartment?

508
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,692
This is my place.

509
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:53,663
You live here?

510
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:56,033
How are you feeling?

511
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:01,805
You look very nice.

512
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:03,507
Thanks.

513
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:07,077
Why don't you sit down?

514
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:09,046
Wherever you're comfortable.

515
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,241
I'm not going
to ask you to do things.

516
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:42,579
I'm just gonna do them
because I want to.

517
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,648
If you're not comfortable,
I want you to stop,

518
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,583
and I'm not gonna be offended.

519
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:50,353
You won't put me off.

520
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:51,822
OK?

521
00:34:51,824 --> 00:34:53,423
OK.

522
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:40,670
You smell like oranges.

523
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:45,876
Thank you.

524
00:35:45,878 --> 00:35:47,611
I'm starting to take it
all internally.

525
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:50,514
I'm not putting it on my face.
I'm not injecting it.

526
00:35:50,516 --> 00:35:52,549
You put it on your face,
and...?

527
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:53,850
- Hey, you're late.
- You don't eat it.

528
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:56,553
Hey, you're gonna have to sit
behind us.

529
00:35:56,555 --> 00:35:59,356
Yeah, you can look at my ass.

530
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:01,925
So, no, I told him,
"I put it in a ball on the bed.

531
00:36:01,927 --> 00:36:03,627
You got to take it downstairs,
you know?

532
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:04,828
I'm not doing it.

533
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,663
This is what
I pay you for."

534
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:07,831
Trying to take more control.

535
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,332
They didn't do it.

536
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:10,567
- They didn't do it?
- No.

537
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:12,569
- Really?
- I don't know.

538
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:27,250
I don't get this.

539
00:36:27,252 --> 00:36:28,451
What is this?

540
00:36:28,453 --> 00:36:30,420
This is coffee.

541
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:54,711
Eat.

542
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,980
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey.

543
00:36:56,982 --> 00:36:59,716
So what's today, babe?

544
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:02,352
- Me?
- Yeah.

545
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:04,354
<i>Kitchen punch list.</i>

546
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:06,823
<i>He's gonna start</i>
<i>with the shelves.</i>

547
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:09,426
<i>He's gonna finish</i>
<i>the lighting.</i>

548
00:37:09,428 --> 00:37:13,330
<i>We'll have the electrical</i>
<i>inspection this week,</i>

549
00:37:13,332 --> 00:37:15,398
and then, you know,

550
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,267
<i>some professional development</i>
<i>stuff for me</i>

551
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:19,636
<i>like selling tips.</i>

552
00:37:19,638 --> 00:37:22,973
Oh, good.
You gonna get back in time?

553
00:37:22,975 --> 00:37:26,009
Have I ever been late
for pickup in six years?

554
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:27,744
Hmm?

555
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,779
Mwah!

556
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:31,881
Ever?

557
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:35,585
- I do it out of my dorm room.
- Told you.

558
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,721
I had to have you do this
a few times before we met.

559
00:37:37,723 --> 00:37:38,622
I hope you understand.

560
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:40,290
I'm pre-law.

561
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:41,858
Uh-huh.

562
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,628
She's looking at me weird.

563
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:49,766
Know what, honey?
Just tell the story.

564
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,735
It's a good one.

565
00:37:51,737 --> 00:37:53,670
You know, I just kept
getting hit on all the time.

566
00:37:53,672 --> 00:37:55,739
I was a cocktail waitress
at the Gansevoort.

567
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:58,642
I was 18, so I just made
a little book and charged them,

568
00:37:58,644 --> 00:38:00,377
and after that,
there were just

569
00:38:00,379 --> 00:38:02,412
so many different people
who came out of the woodwork.

570
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:03,613
The woodwork.

571
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,015
That's a neat way of putting it.

572
00:38:05,017 --> 00:38:06,883
You don't have
any of my information, right?

573
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:08,451
No.

574
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:10,453
Justin comes by,
and I give him the leads.

575
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:11,755
It's all referral.

576
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:13,957
Referral.
Right.

577
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,592
Please.

578
00:38:15,594 --> 00:38:17,327
I can't get caught.

579
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:18,728
I'm on the fast-track law thing.

580
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,764
I mean, can you imagine?

581
00:38:20,766 --> 00:38:22,966
No.

582
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:25,468
So I'd tell you the tricks
to get your money up,

583
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,737
but Justin says
it's not really for the cash.

584
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:30,874
Are you just horny
or something?

585
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:33,043
Um...

586
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,414
Don't share this.

587
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:38,615
Right.

588
00:38:38,617 --> 00:38:40,917
Uh, anything else?

589
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:42,552
Moisturize, maybe?

590
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:44,421
I don't know.

591
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:46,356
That's what my mom
always tells me.

592
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,959
- So, uh...
- Yeah?

593
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:51,795
I'm open to all sorts
of different...

594
00:38:51,797 --> 00:38:53,396
Men?

595
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:54,531
Oh, men? No.

596
00:38:55,701 --> 00:38:57,600
God, no.
No.

597
00:38:57,602 --> 00:39:00,470
They're maybe a little young.

598
00:39:00,472 --> 00:39:04,974
Let me check my book.
I get it.

599
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:08,011
You should work
more than Wednesday mornings.

600
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:32,435
I'm gonna need something
to drink.

601
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:34,437
Of course.

602
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:43,012
I like to go slow.

603
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:45,782
All right.

604
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:52,722
You seem cultured.

605
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,824
Do we know anyone together?

606
00:39:57,662 --> 00:39:58,928
I hope not.

607
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:00,463
Why not?

608
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:03,666
You're playing with me.

609
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:05,702
Oh.

610
00:40:05,704 --> 00:40:07,670
You want to get right to it.

611
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,809
You like to talk?

612
00:40:12,811 --> 00:40:14,077
I'm old-fashioned.

613
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,679
- Let's talk.
- I'll talk.

614
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:17,847
What are your interests?

615
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:19,616
You play tennis?

616
00:40:19,618 --> 00:40:21,951
Go to Bergdorf for lunch?

617
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:23,753
Did you go to the Biennial
this year?

618
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:24,888
I think I'll go.

619
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,823
I'll write you a check.

620
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:29,159
I don't take checks.

621
00:40:29,161 --> 00:40:30,493
Right.

622
00:40:30,495 --> 00:40:32,128
We said $800?

623
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:35,198
I'll give you $400
for your time.

624
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:39,969
Hmm...

625
00:40:45,911 --> 00:40:47,644
When I thought about you
last night,

626
00:40:47,646 --> 00:40:49,446
I thought,
"She's gonna be so nervous,"

627
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:51,648
and you are;
you're so nervous.

628
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,450
It's so great.
I love it.

629
00:40:53,452 --> 00:40:55,452
Oh, my God.

630
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:56,686
And then I thought,

631
00:40:56,688 --> 00:40:58,121
"When is she gonna stop me?

632
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:01,224
At the door?

633
00:41:01,226 --> 00:41:04,594
When I make her a drink?

634
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:08,698
Will she stop me
when I kiss her, maybe?

635
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,034
Maybe later?"

636
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:21,711
So I said to him,
"Actually, no.

637
00:41:21,713 --> 00:41:23,813
I didn't find everything
I was looking for today."

638
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:25,014
What were you looking for?

639
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:28,151
That probiotic
that they never carry.

640
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:29,686
Not the acidophilus.

641
00:41:29,688 --> 00:41:30,653
Oh, the live yogurt?

642
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,489
No, that girlie one.

643
00:41:32,491 --> 00:41:33,957
It's got the name
with the "C" or whatever.

644
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:36,025
Like, of course,
he doesn't even know

645
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:37,694
what I'm talking about.

646
00:41:37,696 --> 00:41:39,162
You know, I said to him,

647
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:40,964
"With everything
that's going around right now,

648
00:41:40,966 --> 00:41:42,932
I really think
that you should have

649
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:44,934
a bottle of hand sanitizer
at all times on the counter

650
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:46,569
for the patrons to use."

651
00:41:46,571 --> 00:41:48,037
- Yeah, it's a pharmacy.
- Right?

652
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:49,973
That's, like, a no-brainer,
right?

653
00:41:49,975 --> 00:41:52,075
And, of course,
like, blank stare.

654
00:41:52,077 --> 00:41:53,710
No idea what the heck
I'm talking about.

655
00:41:53,712 --> 00:41:55,245
And I said to him, you know,

656
00:41:55,247 --> 00:41:57,113
"I'd be really happy
to buy a bottle

657
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:59,549
so that you can
just put it out there right now

658
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:02,285
for everybody to use,
because strep is going around."

659
00:42:02,287 --> 00:42:04,153
- Just do it.
- Again.

660
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:05,522
- Oh, God.
- It's going around again.

661
00:42:05,524 --> 00:42:06,823
- Yeah.
- Mm.

662
00:42:06,825 --> 00:42:08,124
It's called Fresherell.

663
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:09,993
Well, guess what?
He doesn't know that.

664
00:42:09,995 --> 00:42:12,295
Including how
washing your hands

665
00:42:12,297 --> 00:42:14,264
keeps people from, like,
having a public health scare.

666
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:21,204
Cayenne pepper
and lemon juice?

667
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:23,273
My mom gave me that.

668
00:42:23,275 --> 00:42:25,308
Your mom?

669
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:29,279
It's just a cleanse.

670
00:42:29,281 --> 00:42:31,981
It's supposed to start you off.

671
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:47,730
<i>Diet for a New America.</i>

672
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:51,134
Oh, this.

673
00:42:51,136 --> 00:42:54,904
The Bible.

674
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:57,173
<i>Essential Gandhi.</i>

675
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:59,175
This is an excellent book
for weight loss.

676
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:04,180
And then I want you

677
00:43:04,182 --> 00:43:07,283
to take some cayenne pepper
and some lemon juice,

678
00:43:07,285 --> 00:43:09,886
and I want you to sprinkle it
all over your mother's books,

679
00:43:09,888 --> 00:43:14,757
and I want you
to get rid of them,

680
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:17,160
because that shit
will kill you.

681
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:36,045
Seem happy.

682
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:40,149
You want soup?

683
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:41,250
I made some soup.

684
00:43:41,252 --> 00:43:43,152
Yum.

685
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:45,922
Let's go.

686
00:43:45,924 --> 00:43:48,257
What you got?

687
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:49,993
You haven't got this.

688
00:43:49,995 --> 00:43:52,362
Oh, beautiful.

689
00:43:52,364 --> 00:43:54,664
Oh!

690
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:56,866
Nice!

691
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,677
We've got this.

692
00:44:13,284 --> 00:44:14,651
So uncoordinated.

693
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:24,427
How's your head?

694
00:44:24,429 --> 00:44:26,029
It's fine.

695
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:34,937
<i>Um, let's see.</i>

696
00:44:34,939 --> 00:44:36,172
You're getting headaches now?

697
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:37,140
A little.

698
00:44:37,142 --> 00:44:39,442
Beautiful.

699
00:44:39,444 --> 00:44:41,144
It is what it is.

700
00:44:41,146 --> 00:44:45,081
How's the new job?

701
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:47,950
It's...
it is what it is.

702
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,258
Well, all the tests
are negative.

703
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,392
Good.

704
00:44:56,394 --> 00:44:57,727
You are being safe?

705
00:44:57,729 --> 00:44:59,062
- Yes, yes.
- OK.

706
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:06,736
I'm very careful.

707
00:45:06,738 --> 00:45:10,173
<i>OK. Thank you.</i>

708
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:29,992
Fuck.

709
00:45:46,978 --> 00:45:48,344
Hey.

710
00:45:48,346 --> 00:45:50,313
<i>Hey.</i>

711
00:45:50,315 --> 00:45:55,852
Why is a woman from my town
sitting waiting for me?

712
00:45:55,854 --> 00:45:57,954
She's number six.

713
00:45:57,956 --> 00:45:59,222
No, she is not
woman number six.

714
00:45:59,224 --> 00:46:01,124
She is Sam Bennet.

715
00:46:01,126 --> 00:46:04,060
<i>Her husband</i>
<i>works for Goldman Sachs.</i>

716
00:46:04,062 --> 00:46:06,129
Her kids are on
the lacrosse team.

717
00:46:06,131 --> 00:46:08,264
Jesus.

718
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:11,234
Well, I didn't know
that she was from your town.

719
00:46:11,236 --> 00:46:13,169
Whatever.
Just go.

720
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,230
Sam.

721
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:46,502
Pru gave me
the name of your contractor.

722
00:46:46,504 --> 00:46:48,571
Are you looking
to have something done?

723
00:46:48,573 --> 00:46:51,340
My kitchen.

724
00:46:51,342 --> 00:46:53,342
Ah...

725
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:58,848
So GLASSOS
or zebrawood counters?

726
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:00,383
GLASSOS.

727
00:47:00,385 --> 00:47:03,452
Or zebrawood,
but in a place you don't cook.

728
00:47:03,454 --> 00:47:05,021
It's a hard surface to clean.

729
00:47:05,023 --> 00:47:06,923
- So I reached out to...
- Justin.

730
00:47:06,925 --> 00:47:08,558
Justin,
and he wrote back

731
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,426
this time and this place
to meet,

732
00:47:10,428 --> 00:47:14,030
and I said, "Well, you know,
shouldn't we do it at my place?"

733
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:22,104
"Eleanor only works
at her place.

734
00:47:22,106 --> 00:47:25,875
But she's got to meet you
first."

735
00:47:25,877 --> 00:47:27,610
Who's Eleanor?

736
00:47:30,548 --> 00:47:34,951
And why did he say
you don't "discipline"?

737
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:40,890
We sometimes have to manage
expectations.

738
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,527
Well...

739
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:47,029
When I woke up this morning,

740
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:51,100
I thought "Pilates...

741
00:47:51,102 --> 00:47:54,303
or a soy tea latte
in the city with...

742
00:47:54,305 --> 00:47:56,105
Eleanor?"

743
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:02,178
We've never really
said anything to each other.

744
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:05,414
But you think I'm cute?

745
00:48:05,416 --> 00:48:06,983
Well, that's not real.

746
00:48:06,985 --> 00:48:09,051
That's not, you know,
really...

747
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:13,256
It's easy to trick yourself,
isn't it?

748
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:18,094
Every day.

749
00:48:18,096 --> 00:48:19,295
All the time.

750
00:48:19,297 --> 00:48:21,297
It goes by so...

751
00:48:21,299 --> 00:48:22,265
...fast.

752
00:48:22,267 --> 00:48:24,200
It does.

753
00:48:24,202 --> 00:48:27,236
I hardly recognize myself
sometimes.

754
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:29,305
Sam.

755
00:48:29,307 --> 00:48:31,941
I'm on the PTA.

756
00:48:31,943 --> 00:48:34,076
I'm on the board
at my synagogue.

757
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:36,078
I'm the nominating chair
for the Junior League.

758
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,581
I volunteer every Tuesday
at a food bank.

759
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:40,983
I'm the class parent.

760
00:48:40,985 --> 00:48:43,152
Again.

761
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:18,187
Hi, Sam.

762
00:49:18,189 --> 00:49:20,022
Hi, Abby.

763
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:29,231
Want a drink?

764
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:31,100
No.

765
00:49:31,102 --> 00:49:32,702
OK.

766
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:50,219
Ah.

767
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:02,498
Well?

768
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,632
Want to talk?

769
00:50:05,436 --> 00:50:07,636
Wasn't that
what the tea was for?

770
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:12,141
Right.

771
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:39,368
Two-by-sixes?

772
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:44,073
Yeah,
I'm not sure about them.

773
00:50:44,075 --> 00:50:47,510
You didn't want to use
the lighter grout?

774
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:56,318
Pull my hair.

775
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,187
What?

776
00:50:58,189 --> 00:51:00,156
Pull my hair.

777
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:08,264
Harder.

778
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:19,642
Kiss me.

779
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:23,813
Harder.

780
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:40,796
Wow.

781
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:44,433
Spin is kicking your ass.

782
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:48,137
You go every day?

783
00:51:48,139 --> 00:51:50,106
Then yoga.

784
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,642
Oh, gosh.

785
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,723
What the fuck are you doing?

786
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,928
I don't like it.

787
00:53:36,914 --> 00:53:39,682
When did you know?

788
00:53:39,684 --> 00:53:42,451
Are you coming out to me,
Walter?

789
00:53:42,453 --> 00:53:43,586
It's OK, Walter.

790
00:53:43,588 --> 00:53:44,753
I'm a safe person.

791
00:53:44,755 --> 00:53:46,956
Won't tell your wife.

792
00:53:46,958 --> 00:53:48,657
I'm curious.

793
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:49,925
Yeah?

794
00:53:49,927 --> 00:53:51,694
Yeah.

795
00:53:51,696 --> 00:53:55,698
Well, I was 16,

796
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:59,001
and I was in boarding school.

797
00:53:59,003 --> 00:54:00,436
It's a long story.

798
00:54:00,438 --> 00:54:01,470
Come on.

799
00:54:01,472 --> 00:54:03,305
Come on.
Tell me.

800
00:54:03,307 --> 00:54:05,941
Well, our dorm rooms
were connected

801
00:54:05,943 --> 00:54:08,344
by these bathrooms,

802
00:54:08,346 --> 00:54:12,481
and my bathroom neighbor...

803
00:54:12,483 --> 00:54:18,454
...this tall
other 16-year-old...

804
00:54:18,456 --> 00:54:22,424
She was wearing
this little Sonic Youth T-shirt.

805
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:24,526
Big boobs, you know?

806
00:54:24,528 --> 00:54:26,762
She came up into my room,

807
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:29,431
and she slid into my bed.

808
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:31,967
And, uh...

809
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:33,569
I didn't know what to do.

810
00:54:33,571 --> 00:54:36,338
I was shocked, you know?

811
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:40,676
But then she started
touching me,

812
00:54:40,678 --> 00:54:42,478
and it just felt so...

813
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:49,051
Sorry.

814
00:54:49,053 --> 00:54:51,020
Walter, you are so funny.

815
00:54:51,022 --> 00:54:52,488
It was turning me on.

816
00:54:56,993 --> 00:54:58,994
We've been playing this game...
the moms.

817
00:54:58,996 --> 00:55:01,030
It's called "You Should."

818
00:55:01,032 --> 00:55:03,332
Yeah?

819
00:55:03,334 --> 00:55:04,767
Like, Sarah,

820
00:55:04,769 --> 00:55:06,702
like, I said,
"You should wear tighter jeans."

821
00:55:06,704 --> 00:55:07,870
You said that?

822
00:55:07,872 --> 00:55:09,438
Mm-hmm.

823
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,441
Uh, OK,
and then Lisa said to Abby,

824
00:55:12,443 --> 00:55:14,443
"You should totally wear
more lipstick."

825
00:55:14,445 --> 00:55:17,513
And Abby said to Lisa,
"You should read better books."

826
00:55:17,515 --> 00:55:20,683
Uh-huh.

827
00:55:20,685 --> 00:55:24,353
What's my "I Should"?

828
00:55:24,355 --> 00:55:26,588
You should...

829
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:28,590
I don't know.

830
00:55:31,095 --> 00:55:32,661
How's Abby?

831
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:35,531
She's good, I think.

832
00:55:35,533 --> 00:55:37,399
Do you think she's good?

833
00:55:37,401 --> 00:55:39,468
She looks good.

834
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:41,437
She's fixing this place up
in the city.

835
00:55:41,439 --> 00:55:42,805
Yeah, I know.

836
00:55:42,807 --> 00:55:43,839
I'm sure it'll be gorgeous,

837
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:45,641
just like
the six other places.

838
00:55:45,643 --> 00:55:48,744
Has she told you anything?

839
00:55:48,746 --> 00:55:50,079
Yeah.

840
00:55:50,081 --> 00:55:51,680
She tells me everything,

841
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:53,449
and we talk every day...

842
00:55:53,451 --> 00:55:55,951
the kids, the soccer,
the hopes, the dreams,

843
00:55:55,953 --> 00:55:58,520
the house, whatever.

844
00:55:58,522 --> 00:55:59,888
She wants a wrap-around porch.

845
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:04,660
A porch?

846
00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:12,000
You should fuck her
once in a while.

847
00:56:17,774 --> 00:56:19,441
Tell me the truth.

848
00:56:19,443 --> 00:56:21,710
Mm?

849
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,946
You really like me?

850
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:27,082
Yes.

851
00:56:30,388 --> 00:56:32,154
I had such a weird marriage.

852
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:38,127
I kept myself so fit,

853
00:56:38,129 --> 00:56:40,095
great-looking like you.

854
00:56:40,097 --> 00:56:42,598
He was such an asker.

855
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,533
So polite.

856
00:56:44,535 --> 00:56:46,535
He would ask me what
I wanted about everything...

857
00:56:46,537 --> 00:56:49,171
lunch,
what movie I wanted to see.

858
00:56:49,173 --> 00:56:52,174
He would even ask me if I wanted
to have sex with him.

859
00:56:52,176 --> 00:56:53,709
Well, that's lovely.

860
00:56:53,711 --> 00:56:54,977
Well, you'd think.

861
00:56:54,979 --> 00:56:57,513
I don't know.

862
00:56:57,515 --> 00:56:59,515
Got tired of the deference,
you know?

863
00:56:59,517 --> 00:57:00,949
Stop asking.
Just do it.

864
00:57:02,887 --> 00:57:05,621
Never reached out for me,

865
00:57:05,623 --> 00:57:08,724
you know?

866
00:57:08,726 --> 00:57:10,759
Never told me what I wanted.

867
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:13,729
He was always...

868
00:57:13,731 --> 00:57:15,931
I always had to tell him
everything.

869
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:18,767
And at night,
I'd snuggle up to him,

870
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:20,736
and he'd always turn away

871
00:57:20,738 --> 00:57:24,573
as if he'd already
put in his time with me.

872
00:57:24,575 --> 00:57:27,543
I miss him.

873
00:57:27,545 --> 00:57:29,711
He was good.

874
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:41,023
Do you really want
to be doing this?

875
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:47,596
Think you have
the wrong impression of me.

876
00:57:47,598 --> 00:57:48,964
I think I know.

877
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:50,933
You do?

878
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:58,006
<i>Do you have</i>
<i>a husband waiting?</i>

879
00:57:58,008 --> 00:57:59,241
<i>No.</i>

880
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,812
Children?

881
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:06,215
No.

882
00:58:06,217 --> 00:58:09,952
<i>I saw your scar.</i>
<i>They must be young still.</i>

883
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:17,626
You've escaped, haven't you?

884
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:41,884
Wasn't it always...

885
00:58:41,886 --> 00:58:44,987
it was always a buck a tooth,
right?

886
00:58:44,989 --> 00:58:47,723
Well, it depends.

887
00:58:47,725 --> 00:58:50,158
I mean, it depends on...

888
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,928
I think if it's a molar,
it should be $5.

889
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:54,830
I know that's a lot.

890
00:58:54,832 --> 00:58:57,199
But I think $5 for a molar.

891
00:58:57,201 --> 00:58:59,735
We gave Mayer $2, right?

892
00:58:59,737 --> 00:59:00,969
We gave her $2.

893
00:59:00,971 --> 00:59:02,838
What are you talking about?

894
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,240
He thinks we paid her
more than him.

895
00:59:05,242 --> 00:59:07,242
Hmm?

896
00:59:07,244 --> 00:59:09,278
When?

897
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,679
Seriously?

898
00:59:10,681 --> 00:59:11,847
Yeah.

899
00:59:11,849 --> 00:59:13,315
It was a buck, right?

900
00:59:13,317 --> 00:59:14,683
Yeah.

901
00:59:14,685 --> 00:59:16,084
Did you give him more?

902
00:59:16,086 --> 00:59:18,754
I gave Mayer a buck.

903
00:59:18,756 --> 00:59:20,055
See, that's what it is.

904
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:21,189
Oh?

905
00:59:21,191 --> 00:59:22,724
I did, too.

906
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:28,263
Now, you know what he said?

907
00:59:28,265 --> 00:59:30,999
He said he thinks we need
to go back and pay him

908
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:32,768
for every single tooth
that he lost.

909
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:33,835
Oh, no.

910
00:59:33,837 --> 00:59:35,203
Because we paid her double.

911
00:59:35,205 --> 00:59:37,573
No.

912
00:59:53,857 --> 00:59:55,757
Oh, you smell good.

913
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:57,059
It's cucumbers.

914
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:48,210
Abby.

915
01:00:48,212 --> 01:00:51,313
Ow, hon.

916
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:53,215
Um, hey!

917
01:00:53,217 --> 01:00:54,416
Whoa.

918
01:00:54,418 --> 01:00:56,718
Whoa, ho, ho, ho!

919
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,221
Whoa, slow down!

920
01:00:59,223 --> 01:01:01,857
Honey.

921
01:01:03,894 --> 01:01:05,861
Stop.

922
01:01:13,236 --> 01:01:15,237
Please.

923
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:21,677
Please.

924
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:32,421
Monday, number one
at noon, OK?

925
01:01:32,423 --> 01:01:36,725
And then,
Wednesday we can do

926
01:01:36,727 --> 01:01:38,927
number two.

927
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:44,299
Number five
wants to come back.

928
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:45,734
Yeah, no.

929
01:01:45,736 --> 01:01:46,968
No more number five.

930
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:48,970
What?

931
01:01:48,972 --> 01:01:52,708
Just tell The Girl
to send her to someone else.

932
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:55,210
You know, you're getting to be
more trouble than you're worth.

933
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:57,212
I have to protect myself.

934
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:01,249
What did five make you do?

935
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:18,233
What are you doing here, huh?

936
01:02:18,235 --> 01:02:20,235
Oh!

937
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:26,241
Get the fuck off me.

938
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:28,210
Fucking liar.

939
01:02:28,212 --> 01:02:31,046
Fucking fake.

940
01:02:31,048 --> 01:02:33,048
Fuck you.

941
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:38,053
You know, if you're getting
uncomfortable, you can stop.

942
01:02:38,055 --> 01:02:41,323
Who said
I'm getting uncomfortable?

943
01:02:41,325 --> 01:02:42,991
I just thought
you were gonna, you know,

944
01:02:42,993 --> 01:02:45,026
do this a few times for fun
and then...

945
01:02:45,028 --> 01:02:49,164
Justin,
what's happening Thursday?

946
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:20,395
Did you get stood up?

947
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,301
I guess so.

948
01:03:58,935 --> 01:04:00,969
I have five minutes
because I'm in lockdown mode.

949
01:04:00,971 --> 01:04:02,470
Finals are in a week.

950
01:04:02,472 --> 01:04:05,040
College is retarded.

951
01:04:05,042 --> 01:04:06,341
How am I doing?

952
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:08,543
Good.

953
01:04:08,545 --> 01:04:10,345
What do you mean?

954
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:12,848
Am I doing something wrong?

955
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:14,416
Give me a report card.

956
01:04:14,418 --> 01:04:15,851
I want to be good.

957
01:04:15,853 --> 01:04:18,486
You're an A.

958
01:04:18,488 --> 01:04:21,556
Why have the referrals
stopped coming?

959
01:04:21,558 --> 01:04:23,358
I was told
you aren't taking new clients.

960
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:27,963
I told you
I wanted you to work more.

961
01:04:27,965 --> 01:04:30,131
You know what?

962
01:04:34,437 --> 01:04:37,005
I am going to give you
my number.

963
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:43,211
You can call me directly now.

964
01:04:44,647 --> 01:04:46,514
This is just for you, yes?

965
01:04:46,516 --> 01:04:48,083
Yes.

966
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:52,921
You don't have a problem
with this?

967
01:04:52,923 --> 01:04:53,989
Cutting out Justin?

968
01:04:53,991 --> 01:04:55,223
Yeah.

969
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:57,659
Not really.

970
01:04:57,661 --> 01:05:00,061
He's not that cute anyway,
and I think he fucked my friend,

971
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:02,564
which is kind of gross,
right?

972
01:05:02,566 --> 01:05:06,401
I'm learning that it depends.

973
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:36,117
Did you just...?

974
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:56,237
So I was at lunch today
with a client.

975
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:58,073
They are divorcing,
of course,

976
01:07:58,075 --> 01:07:59,541
and he needs a place
in the city,

977
01:07:59,543 --> 01:08:03,611
so I thought, "The loft."

978
01:08:03,613 --> 01:08:06,514
<i>Can he see it?</i>

979
01:08:06,516 --> 01:08:08,716
Sure.

980
01:08:21,163 --> 01:08:23,498
What is that?

981
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,333
What? This?
You can see this?

982
01:08:25,335 --> 01:08:27,802
Yeah.
What happened?

983
01:08:27,804 --> 01:08:29,838
<i>It was an accident.</i>

984
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:35,176
I was hazy for a few days.

985
01:08:35,178 --> 01:08:37,178
It was bloody,

986
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:40,515
which was surprising
because the cut was so tiny.

987
01:08:40,517 --> 01:08:43,318
You're lucky.
You can't see it
under your hair.

988
01:08:45,655 --> 01:08:47,722
<i>Hi, Mrs. Ableman,</i>
<i>this is the school calling.</i>

989
01:08:47,724 --> 01:08:49,157
<i>Your children are here</i>
<i>in the office,</i>

990
01:08:49,159 --> 01:08:50,592
<i>and they haven't been</i>
<i>picked up.</i>

991
01:08:50,594 --> 01:08:52,694
<i>Please give us a call...</i>

992
01:08:52,696 --> 01:08:56,431
So, um, I think this
is going to be my last time.

993
01:09:00,769 --> 01:09:04,139
But, um, I read those books
you told me to read.

994
01:09:06,275 --> 01:09:07,475
And?

995
01:09:07,477 --> 01:09:09,477
They were good.

996
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:11,746
But I didn't lose any weight.

997
01:09:16,453 --> 01:09:19,587
But that <i>Second Sex</i> book,
it was crazy.

998
01:09:19,589 --> 01:09:21,422
It was crazy.

999
01:09:21,424 --> 01:09:23,558
But I liked the Gandhi one.

1000
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:28,296
I liked it when he said,
"Action expresses priorities."

1001
01:09:28,298 --> 01:09:29,697
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1002
01:09:29,699 --> 01:09:31,232
Wait a second.

1003
01:09:31,234 --> 01:09:33,234
It made me think.

1004
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:38,673
Um, I might want
to try something new...

1005
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:39,741
What's happening?

1006
01:09:39,743 --> 01:09:44,179
Like, maybe a guy.

1007
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:55,590
Mom, can I rehearse it
one more time?

1008
01:09:55,592 --> 01:09:56,925
No, really, I'm so tired.

1009
01:09:56,927 --> 01:10:01,262
- I need to rehearse.
- OK.

1010
01:10:01,264 --> 01:10:05,233
The Dominican Republic
is one part of an island.

1011
01:10:05,235 --> 01:10:08,203
Haiti takes up the other part.

1012
01:10:08,205 --> 01:10:12,240
The whole island
is called Hispaniola.

1013
01:10:12,242 --> 01:10:16,377
Christopher Columbus
gave it that name in 1492.

1014
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:17,879
It's good.

1015
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:20,615
Mrs. Bulkan said
I'm really good.

1016
01:10:20,617 --> 01:10:22,817
It's very good.

1017
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:38,299
Sorry again.
I was late.

1018
01:10:38,301 --> 01:10:40,301
Yeah.

1019
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:48,409
I don't know if I like
that Christopher Columbus line.

1020
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:50,011
Do you have a problem with it?

1021
01:10:50,013 --> 01:10:51,813
No.

1022
01:10:54,883 --> 01:10:57,885
You don't like
the Christopher Columbus line?

1023
01:11:01,724 --> 01:11:04,826
Would you do me a favor,
hon?

1024
01:11:04,828 --> 01:11:07,362
Just like it.

1025
01:11:07,364 --> 01:11:11,933
Just go to the play
and sit there and like it.

1026
01:11:11,935 --> 01:11:14,369
Mrs. Bulkan's been teaching
for 30 years.

1027
01:11:14,371 --> 01:11:16,404
Forty years.

1028
01:11:16,406 --> 01:11:18,373
Yeah.

1029
01:11:18,375 --> 01:11:22,010
I mean, is this really the flag
you want to wave?

1030
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:29,450
You just need to like something.

1031
01:11:30,387 --> 01:11:32,687
I'm tired.

1032
01:11:32,689 --> 01:11:34,889
<i>Can I help you?</i>

1033
01:11:34,891 --> 01:11:36,991
Yeah, could I have
a number four with cheese,

1034
01:11:36,993 --> 01:11:40,628
a big one?

1035
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:41,763
<i>Number four with cheese?</i>

1036
01:11:41,765 --> 01:11:43,965
Yes, please.
Thank you.

1037
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:03,918
Evan, this is Justin.

1038
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,520
- How are you, sir?
- How are you?

1039
01:12:05,522 --> 01:12:06,387
Good.
Thank you.

1040
01:12:06,389 --> 01:12:08,022
Abby.

1041
01:12:17,766 --> 01:12:21,369
- It's small.
- It's OK.

1042
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:25,073
Go back to the house
on the weekends for the kids.

1043
01:12:25,075 --> 01:12:26,441
Oh.

1044
01:12:34,616 --> 01:12:37,085
Do you have a tear sheet?

1045
01:12:37,087 --> 01:12:38,753
No, I'm not even done.

1046
01:12:38,755 --> 01:12:40,588
It looks done.

1047
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:45,026
There's a brand-new
built-in steam shower,

1048
01:12:45,028 --> 01:12:46,728
new electrical system,

1049
01:12:46,730 --> 01:12:48,563
brand-new moldings
in the kitchen.

1050
01:12:48,565 --> 01:12:50,998
I've seen so many places.
I just want to stop, you know?

1051
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,735
It's very quiet.
You're all alone on the floor.

1052
01:12:56,672 --> 01:12:59,006
Look at this art.
Wow.

1053
01:12:59,008 --> 01:13:01,042
Abby's a collector.

1054
01:13:19,428 --> 01:13:21,162
Thank you.

1055
01:13:36,645 --> 01:13:38,446
You want more money?

1056
01:13:40,115 --> 01:13:42,116
No.

1057
01:13:42,118 --> 01:13:44,585
But I think you should sell
this place.

1058
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:47,755
- You do?
- Yeah.

1059
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:50,558
You don't have to do this
anymore, you know?

1060
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,660
Am I not doing it right?

1061
01:13:52,662 --> 01:13:54,796
Well, it's just not you.

1062
01:13:57,533 --> 01:14:00,134
I am 42.

1063
01:14:00,136 --> 01:14:03,438
So?

1064
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,640
Something has to be me
by now.

1065
01:14:05,642 --> 01:14:07,608
I think you should tell Kate.

1066
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:13,214
She was just here.

1067
01:14:13,216 --> 01:14:15,049
So...

1068
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:20,755
If she wanted to know,

1069
01:14:20,757 --> 01:14:23,724
it's all right here.

1070
01:14:23,726 --> 01:14:26,894
She doesn't.

1071
01:14:29,531 --> 01:14:31,732
Do you understand?

1072
01:14:39,608 --> 01:14:40,842
How many aisles to go?

1073
01:14:40,844 --> 01:14:42,477
No, convince me again.

1074
01:14:46,115 --> 01:14:48,950
Bring it back.
You have to convince me.

1075
01:14:54,256 --> 01:14:57,525
Just pick it up,
just for me.

1076
01:14:58,227 --> 01:14:59,694
Oh!

1077
01:14:59,696 --> 01:15:00,528
Does that make you...?

1078
01:15:01,865 --> 01:15:04,699
Let's get out of here.

1079
01:15:04,701 --> 01:15:08,102
I want to get out of here.
Go, go.

1080
01:15:08,104 --> 01:15:10,872
- All right.
- Let's get out of here.

1081
01:15:10,874 --> 01:15:12,240
Let's get out of here.
Let's get out of here.

1082
01:15:12,242 --> 01:15:14,609
Let's go.

1083
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:16,978
- Hi, Sam.
- I know...

1084
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:19,647
Abby, hi.

1085
01:15:19,649 --> 01:15:21,916
I've been trying to call you.

1086
01:15:21,918 --> 01:15:22,984
- Hi.
- Hi.

1087
01:15:22,986 --> 01:15:26,821
Uh, Graham Bennet.

1088
01:15:26,823 --> 01:15:29,290
Oh, right.
You're at GS, right?

1089
01:15:29,292 --> 01:15:30,892
Yeah.

1090
01:15:30,894 --> 01:15:33,127
Yeah, my wife represents
all those guys.

1091
01:15:33,129 --> 01:15:34,161
Oh, securities?

1092
01:15:34,163 --> 01:15:35,696
Divorce.

1093
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:36,998
Divorce.

1094
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,267
Divorce.

1095
01:15:39,269 --> 01:15:42,169
Uh, how do you...
you know each other how?

1096
01:15:42,171 --> 01:15:44,805
We're moms.

1097
01:15:44,807 --> 01:15:46,807
Haven't seen you at pickup.

1098
01:15:46,809 --> 01:15:48,709
Yeah, I have to pick
Shea up at preschool,

1099
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:51,946
so the sitter gets Joey.

1100
01:16:00,622 --> 01:16:02,723
All right, OK, so...

1101
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:03,991
- See you... see you guys.
- Bye.

1102
01:16:03,993 --> 01:16:06,027
- Bye.
- Bye.

1103
01:16:06,029 --> 01:16:08,329
<i>Service on 12, please.</i>

1104
01:16:56,778 --> 01:17:00,014
The Dominican Republic
is one part of an island.

1105
01:17:00,016 --> 01:17:02,183
Haiti takes up the other part.

1106
01:17:02,185 --> 01:17:05,052
The whole island
is called Hispaniola.

1107
01:17:05,054 --> 01:17:08,823
Christopher Columbus
gave it that name in 1492.

1108
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:17,331
The capital
of the Dominican Republic
is Santo Domingo.

1109
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:20,301
It is the oldest city
in the Americas.

1110
01:17:20,303 --> 01:17:22,937
The president lives
in the national palace.

1111
01:17:22,939 --> 01:17:24,705
Families usually gather
for lunch.

1112
01:17:24,707 --> 01:17:27,308
It's the biggest meal
of the day.

1113
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:28,743
I don't know.

1114
01:17:28,745 --> 01:17:30,378
Maybe I do.
A nice one.

1115
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:32,113
A nice one?

1116
01:17:32,115 --> 01:17:34,148
Come here, you.

1117
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:36,350
Oh.

1118
01:17:40,389 --> 01:17:42,957
Hey, Kate.

1119
01:17:42,959 --> 01:17:44,959
Kate.

1120
01:17:46,395 --> 01:17:48,929
Kate?

1121
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,969
<i>Hey, where did you go?</i>

1122
01:17:54,971 --> 01:17:57,705
<i>Oh, I had that call.</i>

1123
01:17:57,707 --> 01:17:58,939
<i>Right. Of course.</i>

1124
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:03,210
<i>So I'm gonna be</i>
<i>going into the city.</i>

1125
01:18:03,212 --> 01:18:06,414
<i>I, uh, have a couple</i>
<i>just little finishing things</i>

1126
01:18:06,416 --> 01:18:10,117
<i>to do on the loft.</i>

1127
01:18:10,119 --> 01:18:12,753
<i>I should be done in time</i>
<i>to get the kids.</i>

1128
01:18:17,259 --> 01:18:19,060
<i>Hello?</i>

1129
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:18,953
What do you want? Huh?

1130
01:20:45,607 --> 01:20:47,575
Please put something on.

1131
01:21:16,972 --> 01:21:19,974
I'll do
what you want me to do.

1132
01:21:45,267 --> 01:21:48,369
<i>Hey, Ab, thank you so much</i>
<i>for helping me with this, OK?</i>

1133
01:21:48,371 --> 01:21:50,237
<i>'Cause I'm not getting</i>
<i>a second chance,</i>

1134
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:52,206
<i>you know what I mean?</i>

1135
01:21:52,208 --> 01:21:54,174
<i>I know you know how to go</i>
<i>for what you want.</i>

1136
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:57,244
<i>And I really appreciate it,</i>
<i>so... all right.</i>

1137
01:21:57,246 --> 01:22:00,080
<i>So it's between parchment</i>
<i>and khaki.</i>

1138
01:22:00,082 --> 01:22:04,018
<i>The room is gray, and there's</i>
<i>a gray carpet in there now,</i>

1139
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:06,053
<i>and it's a sunroom,</i>
<i>and it's gray.</i>

1140
01:22:06,055 --> 01:22:10,257
<i>And the grayish one</i>
<i>is the parchment.</i>

1141
01:22:10,259 --> 01:22:12,393
What color are the baseboards?

1142
01:22:12,395 --> 01:22:14,028
<i>I don't know.</i>

1143
01:22:14,030 --> 01:22:16,330
<i>All right, but...</i>

1144
01:22:16,332 --> 01:22:18,299
<i>God, here's the reason why</i>
<i>I want to go with the khaki.</i>

1145
01:22:18,301 --> 01:22:20,167
Mm-hmm.

1146
01:22:20,169 --> 01:22:22,102
<i>Because parchment,</i>
<i>it's not really gray.</i>

1147
01:22:22,104 --> 01:22:24,204
<i>It's more of a stony white,</i>

1148
01:22:24,206 --> 01:22:28,075
<i>and khaki's khaki.</i>

1149
01:22:28,077 --> 01:22:30,277
<i>And even though my want</i>
<i>is gray,</i>

1150
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:33,147
<i>I'm gonna be upset if there's</i>
<i>stains all over the parchment</i>

1151
01:22:33,149 --> 01:22:35,049
<i>because it's too light.</i>

1152
01:22:35,051 --> 01:22:36,650
<i>Is that all</i>
<i>I'm supposed to do,</i>

1153
01:22:36,652 --> 01:22:38,385
<i>is just clean all day long?</i>

1154
01:22:40,189 --> 01:22:42,389
<i>To keep things</i>
<i>light and airy and beachy</i>

1155
01:22:42,391 --> 01:22:44,658
<i>and neutral?</i>

1156
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:49,129
<i>I can't do it because no one</i>
<i>will leave it alone.</i>

1157
01:22:49,131 --> 01:22:51,098
<i>I can't choose what I want.</i>

1158
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,268
<i>It's the illusion of choice.</i>

1159
01:22:56,104 --> 01:22:58,272
<i>Oh, but I know</i>
<i>how you feel about gray.</i>

1160
01:22:58,274 --> 01:23:00,741
<i>You love it.</i>

1161
01:23:00,743 --> 01:23:02,609
<i>But you know,</i>
<i>I'm thinking about,</i>

1162
01:23:02,611 --> 01:23:05,045
<i>"Do I love it enough</i>
<i>to have to live</i>

1163
01:23:05,047 --> 01:23:08,215
<i>with having to clean it</i>
<i>over and over and over?"</i>

1164
01:23:08,217 --> 01:23:10,617
I think beige is good.

1165
01:23:10,619 --> 01:23:13,487
<i>It's not beige.</i>
<i>Is it beige?</i>

1166
01:23:13,489 --> 01:23:15,723
Yeah or khaki.

1167
01:23:15,725 --> 01:23:17,191
<i>It's beige?</i>

1168
01:23:17,193 --> 01:23:18,592
No, I meant khaki.
I meant khaki.

1169
01:23:18,594 --> 01:23:20,527
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1170
01:23:20,529 --> 01:23:23,097
<i>I would never, ever use beige</i>
<i>in any...</i>

1171
01:23:23,099 --> 01:23:24,665
<i>I've learned a lot from you,</i>

1172
01:23:24,667 --> 01:23:26,600
<i>and, I mean,</i>
<i>if I learned anything from you,</i>

1173
01:23:26,602 --> 01:23:28,435
<i>it's to not...</i>

1174
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:32,039
<i>All right.</i>

1175
01:23:32,041 --> 01:23:33,474
<i>Then I'll go back to the...</i>

1176
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:40,180
Kate?

1177
01:24:18,353 --> 01:24:21,055
Haven't seen you
in class lately.

1178
01:24:21,057 --> 01:24:22,689
I'm not stalking you,
I swear.

1179
01:24:22,691 --> 01:24:25,559
I'm just walking
my stupid, spastic dog.

1180
01:24:25,561 --> 01:24:27,127
I've been running a lot.

1181
01:24:29,565 --> 01:24:33,133
I paid you enough?

1182
01:24:33,135 --> 01:24:34,368
Yes.

1183
01:24:37,138 --> 01:24:38,705
I thought we were great
together.

1184
01:24:38,707 --> 01:24:41,075
You were great.

1185
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:47,114
You seemed very excited.

1186
01:24:47,116 --> 01:24:49,483
Mm...

1187
01:24:49,485 --> 01:24:51,485
I thought you'd never
done that before.

1188
01:24:51,487 --> 01:24:54,388
Um, I never said that.

1189
01:24:54,390 --> 01:24:57,324
You were...

1190
01:24:57,326 --> 01:24:58,525
better than me.

1191
01:24:58,527 --> 01:25:01,095
Was it a contest?

1192
01:25:01,097 --> 01:25:03,530
You're bored.

1193
01:25:03,532 --> 01:25:04,865
We both are.

1194
01:25:04,867 --> 01:25:07,267
And we're gonna have
a little secret

1195
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:08,635
when we see each other,

1196
01:25:08,637 --> 01:25:11,638
and that's how it should be.

1197
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:13,607
I'm OK with that.

1198
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:17,177
I like Graham Bennet.

1199
01:25:17,179 --> 01:25:19,146
I like him, too.

1200
01:25:22,283 --> 01:25:24,785
But he's passionate
about you.

1201
01:25:27,288 --> 01:25:28,489
He is.

1202
01:25:28,491 --> 01:25:29,723
So why...?

1203
01:25:36,798 --> 01:25:38,832
- OK.
- OK.

1204
01:26:38,393 --> 01:26:40,394
I was breathing.

1205
01:26:41,729 --> 01:26:44,898
You must be out of breath.

1206
01:26:54,576 --> 01:26:56,210
So I only belong to you,

1207
01:26:56,212 --> 01:26:58,779
and you don't want me.

1208
01:27:01,716 --> 01:27:03,984
I don't want anybody,
Abby.

1209
01:27:11,326 --> 01:27:13,527
I know.

1210
01:27:17,799 --> 01:27:20,000
I'm sorry.

1211
01:27:43,858 --> 01:27:45,325
- Done.
- Congratulations.

1212
01:27:45,327 --> 01:27:46,426
Yes.

1213
01:27:46,428 --> 01:27:48,629
Thank you.

1214
01:27:53,334 --> 01:27:56,403
You OK?

1215
01:27:56,405 --> 01:27:57,437
Yeah.

1216
01:27:57,439 --> 01:27:59,940
Enjoy your new home.

1217
01:27:59,942 --> 01:28:00,907
It's a good space.

1218
01:28:00,909 --> 01:28:01,975
Yeah.

1219
01:28:01,977 --> 01:28:03,877
It is.

1220
01:28:05,747 --> 01:28:06,913
Huh?

1221
01:28:06,915 --> 01:28:09,449
What happened?

1222
01:28:09,451 --> 01:28:12,419
I was sitting in my house.

1223
01:28:12,421 --> 01:28:17,057
Then I was sitting
in your house.

1224
01:28:17,059 --> 01:28:19,893
So crazy,
the way things happen.

1225
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:25,699
Can I ask you a question?

1226
01:28:25,701 --> 01:28:28,468
Sure.

1227
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:31,471
Did you leave, or did she?

1228
01:28:36,878 --> 01:28:39,046
It's hard to say.

1229
01:28:47,422 --> 01:28:48,455
Put your head up.

1230
01:28:48,457 --> 01:28:49,856
OK.

1231
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:18,852
And they said
it's not ready?

1232
01:29:56,524 --> 01:29:57,557
Kids are sleeping.

1233
01:29:57,559 --> 01:29:58,925
Cool.

1234
01:29:58,927 --> 01:30:01,695
I think I want to do
a porch out here.

1235
01:30:01,697 --> 01:30:03,830
Totally.

1236
01:30:03,832 --> 01:30:06,433
That's white, wrap-around...

1237
01:30:06,435 --> 01:30:08,101
With a beadboard ceiling.

1238
01:30:08,103 --> 01:30:11,638
And a Tuscan,
squared, kind of tapered column.

1239
01:30:27,722 --> 01:30:29,990
Gross.
Who does this?

1240
01:30:32,693 --> 01:30:35,529
So what's this weekend?

1241
01:30:35,531 --> 01:30:39,166
Oh, I have so much to do.

1242
01:30:39,168 --> 01:30:40,901
Gonna paint the front door.

1243
01:30:40,903 --> 01:30:43,170
It's getting disgusting.

1244
01:30:43,172 --> 01:30:47,040
The car needs a service.

1245
01:30:47,042 --> 01:30:48,909
<i>I'm getting a sprinkler system</i>
<i>this year.</i>

1246
01:30:48,911 --> 01:30:51,211
<i>The soaker hoses</i>
<i>weren't the answer.</i>

1247
01:30:51,213 --> 01:30:52,846
<i>We tried taking shortcuts.</i>

1248
01:30:52,848 --> 01:30:54,915
It just ends up costing more.

1249
01:30:57,185 --> 01:30:59,019
<i>We're gonna take</i>
<i>some of the money</i>

1250
01:30:59,021 --> 01:31:00,854
<i>from the sale</i>
<i>of the apartment,</i>

1251
01:31:00,856 --> 01:31:03,957
then go to Argentina
for the break.

1252
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:06,126
<i>Kate said she wants</i>
<i>to do more traveling.</i>

1253
01:31:06,128 --> 01:31:07,961
<i>She's on this new kick</i>

1254
01:31:07,963 --> 01:31:10,163
<i>about how she wants</i>
<i>to see the world.</i>

1255
01:31:10,165 --> 01:31:11,998
She says she doesn't want to be
<i>two old ladies</i>

1256
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,835
<i>on a stupid road trip</i>
<i>to South Carolina in 20 years.</i>

1257
01:31:14,837 --> 01:31:16,937
<i>She wants adventure.</i>

1258
01:31:16,939 --> 01:31:20,774
Shit hole.
Good job.

1259
01:31:20,776 --> 01:31:23,543
That's what she wants?

1260
01:31:25,046 --> 01:31:27,013
What do you want?

1261
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:34,054
I want to take
a hot yoga class after this.
