4
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,680
Hello? ls that you, Emmanuelle?

5
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,680
Hello, Marie?

6
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,360
Yes, I'm leaving.

7
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,360
My flight is at 10.

8
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,200
Yes, I'll hurry up.

9
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,080
Sure, you can come if you like.

10
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,480
No, neither Christian
  or anyone else. Come alone.

11
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,880
All right. See you then.
  Bye bye.

12
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,960
You'll be fine at 5 o'clock.
  -Yes, but when one is alone...

13
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,560
One is never alone in life.
  It's like on a boat:

14
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,880
Worries, love seem unreal.

15
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,360
Everything is allowed!
  -Yes, but nothing is possible.

16
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,680
Wrong.
  Lots of people fuck on airplanes.

17
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,200
I'd never dare!
  -One must always dare.

18
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,960
But if what you say is true,
  aren't you afraid she'll...

19
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,200
No, I didn't marry her to
  deprive her of anything...

20
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,440
Nor to put her in a cage...

21
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,640
But because she loves to make
  love and she's great at it!

22
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,440
And you don't think some people
  would try and take advantage?

23
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,680
I'm not jealous, I say.
  Jealousy is outdated.

24
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,880
See this girl?
  All science and innocence.

25
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,680
But it's no miracle.
  They all had to learn.

26
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,680
And they do anything you want?
  -Even more. For the right price.

27
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,480
That's what bothers me.
  I don't like paying for it.

28
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,360
The idea makes me go limp.

29
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,840
It's hardly that simple.

30
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,880
I'm off to the airport.
  See you at 5 at the embassy.

31
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,800
It's always the same faces.
  Ex-adventurers, diplomats.

32
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,360
They are dying to see you.
  I showed them your pictures.

33
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,440
Have you shown them my pictures?
  -Of course.

34
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,520
I enjoy watching them
  and showing them off.

35
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:01,480
Maybe even more so.
  I'm proud of you.

36
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,840
Say, this photographer.
  -What about him?

37
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,320
Have you made love with him?

38
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,920
Oh, Jean.
  He never even touched me.

39
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,120
Strange. I thought an artist
  always had to sleep with his model

40
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,960
before accomplishing a portrait.
  If not before, then afterwards.

41
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,360
Poor fellow!
  He must have suffered.

42
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,160
Not at all.
  He was gay.

43
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,760
Wait a minute.

44
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,280
What is the matter, dear?
  -Let's leave. It's horrible.

45
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,960
This boy with the chicken.
  This beggar! I hate this country.

46
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,120
That's nothing, darling.

47
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:12,840
Welcome to Thailand.
  Take it easy.

48
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:21,800
You'll see, you'll love the house.

49
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,760
I drive by here every day
  on my way to the embassy.

50
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,640
I don't see it anymore.

51
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,160
Come on, baby.

52
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,800
This is Tim, Vine, our cooks.

53
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,800
No, not like that. Like this!

54
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,520
And this is Ap and Noi, the maids.

55
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,160
They are stunning. You chose them?
  -Yes. John, the houseboy.

56
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,960
Our factotum.
  Come see the house.

57
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,000
It is over 100 years old.
  It belongs to a princess.

58
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,600
I had to court her for three
  months before she let me rent it.

59
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,760
It's splendid.

60
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,880
Just splendid!

61
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,480
I never imagined anything like this.
  Unbelievable.

62
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,320
Your little maids. Are they good
  at making love with you?

63
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,280
I couldn't compare
  any other woman to you!

64
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,640
You are just saying that
  to please me.

65
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,560
Please me. Please me...

66
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,480
Please me...

67
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
Not at all.
  I'm fitting out my house.

68
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,640
I'm very happy to be alone
  with Jean.

69
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,640
You'll see in a few months' time.
  Our only enemy here is boredom!

70
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,200
And our only ally to fight it:
  making love.

71
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,720
You'll get around to it. Unless Jean
  has suddenly become jealous?

72
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,280
No, it is a choice I made myself.

73
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,480
Jean would gladly push me
  into his friends' arms.

74
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,880
I never tell my husband anything.
  He's no worse off because of that.

75
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,920
True, Richard does looks very smug.

76
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,240
Hi, girls.
  Allow me to present Emmanuelle.

77
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,600
Emmanuelle, you just missed out
  on a great occasion.

78
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:46,600
A small naval vessel.

79
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:52,120
It's crew was splendid
  and knew how to manoeuvre!

80
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,280
Why didn't you come?
  You'd have had lots of success.

81
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,160
I spent the weekend at Pattaya
  with my husband.

82
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,560
Jean took you away on purpose.
  -No, I don't think so.

83
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,480
Your loss. Occasions like this one
  are quite rare in Bangkok.

84
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,560
I haven't been home for two days.
  Luckily my husband is very busy.

85
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,640
He works so hard at the embassy?
  -Do you like your house?

86
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,280
Yes, it's beautiful.
  Jean decorated it himself.

87
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,880
It's a splendid site.
  -You know it?

88
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,160
Yes, Jean invited me over one
  evening while you were in Paris.

89
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,280
In Paris? You must tell us
  about all your affairs.

90
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,720
Don't worry, you can confide in me.
  I'm quiet as a grave.

91
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,040
What do you want to know?

92
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,600
It may sound dumb, but I never
  cheated on my husband in Paris.

93
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,560
Really. Wow. Well done.
  Incredible.

94
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,760
Is she as good as she says?
  -I'm afraid so.

95
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,280
Oh, it's you? You scared me.

96
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm always a bit scary.
  You are very lovely all over.

97
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,880
But I wouldn't be surprised
  if you were a bit of a liar.

98
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,440
How come?

99
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,920
Have you never cheated
  on your husband?

100
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:36,120
No, I have never cheated on him.
  Cheating means hiding, lying.

101
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,440
Who is that girl?

102
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,160
She's called Bee.
  She's not quite part of our group.

103
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,760
Have you never cheated
  with a girl either?

104
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,920
Does it count with girls?

105
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,560
Try it with me some day.
  You'll see if it doesn't count.

106
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,000
I'd like to talk with you.
  May I come see you?

107
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,160
Do you know the address?

108
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,880
Yes. See you tomorrow afternoon.
  My name is Marie-Ange.

109
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,440
Hello.
  -Hello. I bet you are Jean.

110
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,720
Marie-Ange. My name is Marie-Ange.
  I'm a friend of Emmanuelle's.

111
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,720
My wife hides such beautiful
  friends from me.

112
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,640
Well. I'd like to become her friend.
  She asked me to come see her.

113
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,880
She's in her room. Go on in.

114
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,200
See you around, I hope.

115
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,840
Oh, it's you. I hadn't heard you.

116
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,920
You're beautiful. Who took it?

117
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,200
A photographer.
  One of Jean's friends.

118
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,200
Don't you have any more?
  -Any more?

119
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,840
Photos, of you making love.
  -Of course not. Silly you.

120
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,440
Do you know why I eat lollipops?
  -Because you like them, I guess.

121
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,560
No, it excites the old geezers.
  If only you had seen your husband.

122
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,920
But he isn't old!
  -How old is he?

123
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,720
32.
  -Well, there you go.

124
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,720
Were you asleep? At this hour?
  -Yes. I was.

125
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,640
What an enormous bed!
  How many can you fit in there?

126
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,320
These are twin beds
  pushed together.

127
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,280
Don't listen to the girls bragging.

128
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,520
They don't do one tenth
  of what they claim.

129
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,920
How is that?
  -Well, the girls at the pool.

130
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,240
Come on, let's not stay here.

131
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,800
Your house is very cosy
  and you have a great view.

132
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,760
It was very nice of you
  to come see me.

133
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,080
Was there something special
  you wanted?

134
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,400
Not at all. I just chose you.
  -Chose me?

135
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,560
Excuse me.

136
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:58,480
Oh! French newspapers.
  -Jean got them at the embassy.

137
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,120
I like your husband's looks.
  You must give me a picture of him.

138
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,400
I like touching myself.
  Great, isn't it?

139
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,080
Do you like doing it?
  -No.

140
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:28,680
Don't you like it?
  -Yes, but not now, not like this.

141
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,160
Don't tell me you're ashamed?
  -Not at all. But I am surprised.

142
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,760
You are so young.
  -I've done it since I was 12.

143
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,200
No one taught me.
  My hands found out by themselves.

144
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,640
I think it's quite normal.
  Don't you?

145
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,800
How did you start with men?

146
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,200
Jean deflowered me
  the day after I met him.

147
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,240
We met at my parent's friends.

148
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:58,200
He arranged for privacy and asked
  all sorts of questions. Like you.

149
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,240
The next day,
  he invited me for a drive.

150
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,240
He stopped in the forest
  of Fontainebleau.

151
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,160
He took me right there in the car.

152
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,440
It may not be comfortable,
  but it's quite normal.

153
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:16,080
Eleven per cent of all girls
  get deflowered in a car.

154
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,720
What does it change
  to be married?

155
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:27,080
Nothing. Well, at first I found
  it strange to make love at night.

156
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,440
Then Jean left...

157
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,560
He wasn't afraid
  to leave you in Paris?

158
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:38,600
No, he always tells me I am free.
  I may do what I want.

159
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,480
That scares me.

160
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:50,160
So what you said yesterday is true.
  You never cheated on your husband?

161
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:56,080
No, I said
  I never cheated on him in Paris.

162
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,360
I said
  I never cheated on him in Paris.

163
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,680
What have you done today, darling?
  -Nothing.

164
00:28:53,920 --> 00:29:00,160
Just like all my girlfriends
  in Bangkok. What can you do here?

165
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,440
There are lots of things to do.

166
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,920
Tennis, golf, squash...

167
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,000
One can sail on the canals
  or visit the pagodas.

168
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,240
One can make love.
  -Even when you're not around?

169
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,840
You are not my possession, not my
  beauty. You are beauty itself.

170
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,800
I love you.

171
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,760
If it's really love,
  how far can it go?

172
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,320
It would be a poor love
  if it lent itself to measuring.

173
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:43,000
Am I the woman you want?
  -Even more than that.

174
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,160
And I want to become yet more
  than that. How can I explain?

175
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,800
I feel that in love there must
  be something more important.

176
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,320
Brighter than just technique.

177
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,440
I am certain that the answer lies
  in physical love.

178
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,880
Maybe it's in your mind,
  your mentality.

179
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:09,480
A different way of conceiving love?
  -Not only love, everything.

180
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,640
I want to drink you.

181
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,040
It must have been Marie-Ange
  who troubled me.

182
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,280
Why Marie-Ange?
  -She's quite forward.

183
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,360
Will that little girl reveal
  the mysteries of love to you?

184
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,000
Why not?
  I certainly need to progress.

185
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,600
Find out things to become
  a real woman, your woman.

186
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,240
Marie-Ange is innocent.

187
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:04,960
I mean, she is so pure.

188
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,080
Compared to her,
  I feel very prejudiced.

189
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:16,080
You want to make love to her.
  Don't worry, so do l!

190
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,920
No, that's not it.
  Marie-Ange to me is...

191
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,720
Like a teacher. Like you.

192
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,360
She's very natural.

193
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:35,560
Why can you say: "She's got a pretty
  nose." "l had a dream last night."?

194
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,720
But you can't say: "He has a big
  cock. He fucked my ass tonight."

195
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,280
You can say that, you just did.

196
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:39,120
Look, hold it like this with
  your wrist supple at all times.

197
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,200
You're lovely!

198
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,520
No, enough, I've had it.
  I've lost the use of my legs.

199
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:02,680
Well you still have them,
  and they look splendid.

200
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:07,880
I'm dead. Let's continue this
  some other time.

201
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,960
My ugly duckling is all wet.

202
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,840
Apparently, I'm a free man!

203
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,360
You can do what you want,
  as long as I may do the same.

204
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:04,160
This goes for all my husbands.
  -I'm the first, and only one.

205
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,960
I'm talking about future ones.
  -Did you hear that, Emmanuelle?

206
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,680
I dread being
  even more free one day.

207
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:16,960
One husband will suffice for me.
  -Look, your young friend claims you.

208
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,680
Excuse me.

209
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,760
This is Yves,
  whom I mentioned to you.

210
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,480
Delighted to meet you.
  Jean has told me so much about you.

211
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,200
I thought you might
  discover Bangkok together.

212
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,840
He only knows the naughty places.
  -How ghastly! I never go there!

213
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,520
Finally a virtuous man!
  -He's just a hypocrite.

214
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,600
He's just a part
  of a hypocritical class.

215
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,280
Good evening, I'll take
  Emmanuelle away from you.

216
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,760
I've got a man for you.
  -Who says I want one?

217
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,400
You must take a lover if you
  want to become a real woman.

218
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,240
But I love my husband.

219
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,280
You're a virtuoso playing all alone.
  Time for your first concert!

220
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:08,440
Promise you'll do what I ask.
  It'll be fine.

221
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,400
Well, if that tickles your fancy.
  -There he is.

222
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,720
Mario, the man I've found for you.

223
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:18,720
But that's an old geezer!
  -Knowledge is always on the ball.

224
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,880
Forgive me for bailing out
  of all this disgusting talk.

225
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:28,800
Is fucking your only topic? I'll go
  back to my sorry life. Good night!!

226
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,160
She is angry.

227
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,640
May I present Emmanuelle.

228
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,680
Marie-Ange, good evening.
  Gosh, what a looker your friend is.

229
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:45,400
I'll lend her to you, if you want.
  -And if I want.

230
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,280
You have a great body.

231
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,840
You could say:
  "Your dress becomes you."

232
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,520
I am not naked, you know.

233
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:58,280
The important thing is not that you
  be naked, but that I see you naked.

234
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,800
Won't you smile for me?

235
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,680
Let's make up over a drink.
  -Were we at ends, then?

236
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,960
Marie-Ange has told me
  a lot about you.

237
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,200
Whatever might she have revealed?

238
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,440
She talked about your games
  and common Lolita games.

239
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,760
She says you must become an adult.
  Or do you prefer no to change?

240
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
No, not really.
  -So, change.

241
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,400
Would you supper with me
  one of these evenings?

242
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:36,840
You are not giving me any answer.
  -Maybe... We'll see. Excuse me.

243
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:47,000
How did you like Mario?
  Great, isn't he?

244
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,200
Not all that irresistible.
  All cliche.

245
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,640
He loves listening to himself.

246
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,840
Why don't you present me to Bee?
  -No way.

247
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,480
Ariane, I need you.

248
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,720
You need me.

249
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,160
You tease,
  you're naked under your dress!

250
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,560
Have you had any sex
  since squash? With whom?

251
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,160
I'm not telling.
  -So, what do you want?

252
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,120
I want to meet Bee.
  -You want that licentious girl?

253
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:33,440
You are like me.
  Children who are alike, play alike.

254
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,160
No, I won't do it.
  Fend for yourself!

255
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,560
I'd like to talk to you.
  -Go on. I'm listening.

256
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,280
But not here, like this.
  I'd like to see you again.

257
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,840
Impossible, I'll leave Bangkok
  tomorrow evening.

258
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:54,040
Are you free tomorrow afternoon?
  -No, I'm working.

259
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,920
Working? You must be the only one
  around. What are you doing?

260
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,640
I am an archaeologist.
  I'm called Bee.

261
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,600
I know, like the insect.
  That's because you're working.

262
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,120
I never thought about that.

263
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,160
What are you doing?
  -It fits you.

264
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,360
If you don't want it, you can
  give it back to me tomorrow.

265
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,800
You're joking.
  -No. See you tomorrow.

266
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,600
By the way, where do we meet?

267
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:28,040
At two o'clock, at the
  Wat-Sa pontoon by the khlongs.

268
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,840
The what?
  -The canals, you know.

269
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:35,600
Yes... I'll find it.

270
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,400
"Dear Emmanuelle."

271
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:26,480
"You disappeared quite suddenly.
  I'll expect you at nine tonight."

272
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,400
"My car will fetch you. Mario."

273
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,480
Here. Help me. This way.

274
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,120
Sorry I have no time for you.
  My schedule has been altered.

275
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,520
Fortuitous that we met last night.
  I never go out, so to speak.

276
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,800
My boyfriend brought me along.
  -The officer, he's your fellow.

277
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,280
Yes, he kept insisting. He had
  to show off his brand-new uniform.

278
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,360
Why did you look at me
  like that last night?

279
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,160
Because you are beautiful.

280
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,360
Do you want some?

281
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:39,240
Well now, you, Bee, busy insect,
  tell me about yourself.

282
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,800
Too complicated.
  I prefer you talk about me.

283
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,600
I think your are a girl who is
  happy in her work and never bored.

284
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,760
How great that would be!

285
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,720
Are you married?

286
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,080
No.
  -But you are in love.

287
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:05,120
I was. No more!
  You know, I have no time.

288
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:09,160
See, men meet up in New York.
  They ask: "How much do you make?"

289
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:16,520
Women ask: "Are you in
  love, married?" Funny, no?

290
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,960
Not at all. I see you are judging
  me. I don't know what to say.

291
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,080
So, say nothing!

292
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:35,360
And you, why did you look
  at me like that, yesterday?

293
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:41,360
Because I immediately felt
  you were different.

294
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:45,480
From all these women
  I meet in Bangkok.

295
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:50,120
A world where doing nothing
  becomes an art.

296
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:55,000
I feel like a convict
  escaping from prison.

297
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:58,520
Are you bored?
  -What?

298
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,920
Boredom...

299
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,760
Your life is boring in Bangkok?

300
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Perhaps. I don't think so.
  Anyway, not any more.

301
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,320
Are you going far?
  -Two days travelling:

302
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,520
One day by jeep,
  one day by horse.

303
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:23,040
I was delighted to see you.
  I'm sorry I won't see you any more.

304
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,840
When will I see you again?
  -Who knows?

305
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:30,200
I haven't even asked your name.
  -Emmanuelle.

306
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,480
So, good bye, Emmanuelle.

307
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,880
I almost forgot.
  -Please keep it.

308
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:50,680
No, thank you.
  -Please do. It's my favourite.

309
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,920
Oh, really! No! No way!

310
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,800
Good bye, Emmanuelle, I like you.

311
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:03,160
You're a gorgeous doll.
  We'll play some other time.

312
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,880
Whatever are you doing?

313
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:14,320
Whatever I like.
  I am free, am I not?

314
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,720
If you say so.

315
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:31,480
This time she didn't come home.
  -You must be happy.

316
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,680
You wanted your wife to be free:

317
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,320
"She's not my object,
  not my beauty". So, here you go!

318
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,160
What you really wanted
  was not for your wife to be free.

319
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,360
You wanted to use her as you
  please, just like these girls.

320
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,760
Who is that? Let him in.

321
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,640
Do you speak French?
  -Yes, sir.

322
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:06,960
Tell your master that he was
  bested, well, too late. Too late.

323
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:20,880
We have to hurry, now, if we want
  to be there before nightfall.

324
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:25,760
Is it still far?
  -No. But we've lost some time.

325
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,600
Do you think so?

326
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:37,360
That's not what I meant.
  Come on.

327
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,320
What'll I wear?

328
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,960
Here you go...

329
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:42,600
What a night yesterday.

330
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:49,040
Your wife, what a pair of knockers!

331
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:54,760
If I had a wife like yours,
  I wouldn't live in the brothels.

332
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,720
I've got something to tell you.

333
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:16,760
I've said it a thousand times,
  but only to my husband.

334
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:21,520
Yes, I think I love Jean
  as deeply as anyone could.

335
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,800
Yes, that's what I thought.

336
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:30,560
He has always said that love was the
  search of pleasure, always further.

337
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:35,720
With either a man or a woman.

338
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:39,920
But now, I feel differently.

339
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:46,800
When I saw the cascade,
  I thought, "How beautiful."

340
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:56,280
I felt it wasn't beautiful
  unless I could tell the one I love.

341
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:01,080
Listen, I like you.

342
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:08,440
That means
  that I don't want to hurt you.

343
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,040
But I don't love you.

344
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,800
All right?

345
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,760
It's not that bad.

346
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:27,880
Let me tell you a story.

347
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:33,480
One day, at school,
  I made a flawless dictation.

348
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,600
I was proud.

349
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:42,280
The teacher accused me of cribbing
  off somebody. She never believed
me.

350
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:48,400
I was shattered.
  For two whole days.

351
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:57,000
When my sorrow disappeared, I was
  sad. Sad to be consoled so quickly.

352
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:51,200
Look here, the bachelor.

353
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:54,040
I want to talk to you.

354
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:59,600
Right now, I don't have much to say.
  But do come in. For a nightcap.

355
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,480
I've just come home.

356
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:07,200
I think I've had
  a bit too much to drink.

357
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,200
Gilbert is staying with Martine.
  You know, the consul's daughter.

358
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:16,560
She doesn't want to be alone
  at night. Actually, I don't either.

359
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:22,400
I'm glad to see you. Even though
  you have a long face tonight.

360
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:26,160
Where is Emmanuelle?
  -I don't know.

361
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,480
Furthermore, I don't give a damn.

362
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:32,280
Did you present her to Bee?
  -Well, yes, if you like.

363
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:37,400
Is she with Bee?
  She'll come back. They always do.

364
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:44,000
I'm not joking, Ariane!
  -You've become a bit of a bore.

365
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,480
Well, that's not quite true.

366
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:50,680
In fact, you are becoming
  the laughing stock around here.

367
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,560
Help me, will you?

368
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,960
I don't know what to do.
  Emmanuelle has changed the game.

369
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:06,120
She is cheating.
  -You know, you are ludicrous.

370
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:09,280
You are doing exactly
  what you blame Emmanuelle for.

371
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:12,080
You are showing feelings!

372
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:15,240
Do you know what feelings are?

373
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:22,800
Instead of whining, you should
  see to your wife's education.

374
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:28,680
If you can't, leave it
  to competent people.

375
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:35,280
Like Mario.
  He seems to be interested.

376
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:40,280
Ariane, you're a slut.
  -Really?

377
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,840
So what are you waiting for?

378
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,680
You are a bitch!

379
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:14,040
Whatever are you wearing?

380
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:21,680
Now, I didn't mean it, darling.

381
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:30,760
No more playing the adult.

382
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:36,440
I don't know how to do it properly.

383
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:46,320
I've tried to get interested
  in their thoughts...

384
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:55,040
But I can't... not anymore.

385
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:59,400
Relax, relax, it's all right.

386
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:04,520
In fact,
  it is much better this way.

387
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:09,040
You would only have got hurt.

388
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:12,800
Passionate love is not for us.

389
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:16,920
It's much too sad, too humiliating
  to demean oneself in front of them.

390
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:20,560
You must forget.

391
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,760
Take your revenge in other arms.

392
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,880
It's the only answer,
  the only one she expects.

393
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:31,480
I'll help you, I'll help you.

394
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:54,160
Quickly! It's ten past now.

395
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:59,600
Will you ever be on time?!
  -I'm always on time.

396
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:02,480
On time leaving, but not arriving.

397
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:09,400
Why don't you like me?
  -I do, but you've disappointed me.

398
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:17,320
I know why. You're jealous.
  -Jealous? Of Bee?

399
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:21,160
Poor darling,
  you really don't get it, do you?

400
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:24,880
Your affair with Bee
  is everything I abhor.

401
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:33,640
Violins, walks in moonlight,
  not my thing.

402
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:42,000
I like surprising things. You know,
  I slept with your husband.

403
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:45,880
I know, he told me. Was it good?

404
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:48,760
Unexpected. He almost raped me.

405
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,680
He raped you?
  -Almost.

406
01:05:54,960 --> 01:06:02,640
What is it?
  -Help me, please. My bra.

407
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:12,680
I love your skin, so soft
  and smooth like a pebble.

408
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,840
Let go of me!
  -What's wrong?

409
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,440
We are late, you said so yourself.

410
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:23,960
We can play squash some other time.
  But we can play at something else.

411
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,760
Let go.

412
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:34,600
Let me give you some advice.
  -No.

413
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:37,040
You'll get it anyway.

414
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:44,640
You are going through life like
  a baby waiting for her first cold.

415
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:49,120
You'll become some statue,
  unless you pay with your person.

416
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:55,800
If you want to live and forget Bee,
  you must learn. Go see Mario.

417
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,280
Why do you all go on
  about this old man?

418
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,400
The old guys are a treasure chest
  of erotic science.

419
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:05,000
Erotic science?

420
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:09,160
When you are young, you make love
  naturally... as you eat or breathe.

421
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:13,080
When you're still making love
  at Mario's age, it's poetry.

422
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:17,120
It's something you really want,
  and reflect upon.

423
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,440
That's eroticism!

424
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:24,440
Go see Mario.

425
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:14,800
I don't like him. He's disgusting,
  pompous! An ageing Don Juan.

426
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:19,160
You promised Marie-Ange to do
  whatever she told you to.

427
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:21,840
How do you know about that?

428
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:27,760
She told me.
  -I want to see Marie-Ange.

429
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,560
She is with her parents at the sea.
  I promised that we would visit her.

430
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:43,040
Did you see her while I was gone?
  -Yes, I did.

431
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:47,920
Why did you invite Mario?

432
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:54,760
He came for you the other night.
  So I invited him to come back.

433
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,240
Did he accept?
  -Of course. Perfect!

434
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:03,360
You fix me up
  like a sacrificial lamb.

435
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:08,320
What about yourself?
  -I didn't want to ruin the evening.

436
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:14,160
I'm going to Vientiane for two days.
  You are ravishing.

437
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,520
You are beautiful.

438
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:58,840
That's the least I could do.

439
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:02,560
I am thrilled to have you here.

440
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:14,640
To the future law.

441
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:19,200
Before we drink
  may I know this law?

442
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:26,040
This law proclaims that making
  love without restraint is great.

443
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:33,280
Virginity is no virtue.
  The couple is no limit.

444
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:38,360
One must expand one's boundaries
  until there are none left.

445
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:42,120
So, to the future law.

446
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:52,560
Let's eat now.
  Eating is also important.

447
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:56,800
Jean says there is one thing
  more important.

448
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,400
Coming a lot.

449
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,920
I'm not scared.

450
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:36,720
Bravo. Down with all fears.

451
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:40,640
Fears of thinking,
  of being happy.

452
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:44,440
All these fears make up
  a false morality.

453
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:51,560
Conformity, refusal to live.
  In fact: lying!

454
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:01,800
Come here!

455
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:17,680
You see these legs?
  Take them!

456
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:23,200
I'm giving them to you.

457
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:59,960
You can't give it all
  to the same person.

458
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:05,080
But what do you want?
  What part of me do you want?

459
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:59,960
Let me go.
  -What, let you go?

460
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:02,440
Or be satisfied with what I am.

461
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:05,840
Make love to me
  and send me back to my husband.

462
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:10,120
Your husband is not there.
  He entrusted me with you.

463
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:13,080
But why?

464
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:19,360
So you can break through a barrier.
  Let you into the land of eroticism.

465
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:49,680
Eroticism, how do you perceive it?

466
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:54,480
Well. It's... how do I put it?

467
01:14:54,720 --> 01:15:00,280
It's a cult of sensual pleasures?
  -Not at all.

468
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:06,360
It is not an exercise of the senses,
  but rather a movement of the soul.

469
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:12,560
It's an art, a school helping
  to humanize sexual acts.

470
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:18,160
It's a refusal of subterfuge.
  It's lucidity itself.

471
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:21,640
Well, if that's it,
  it's not very tantalizing.

472
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:26,120
So eroticism is the opposite
  of making love?

473
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:31,240
It is mostly through love.

474
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:37,600
It's an effort to break
  with everyday life.

475
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:45,640
It's the victory of dreams
  over nature.

476
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:50,640
I prefer thinking of love
  simply as pleasure.

477
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:57,120
What counts is not making love,
  but how to make it.

478
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:03,240
You mean the 32 positions!
  -Absurd.

479
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:11,360
Asians talk technique
  all the time.

480
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:19,040
But the body is necessary
  to reach the important stage.

481
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:23,520
Take off the gag.

482
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:28,880
Scream your centennial claim!

483
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:32,080
Destroy established values.

484
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:40,120
Fill your head with sensations
  that no one could give you.

485
01:16:54,480 --> 01:17:02,400
Use the unusual,
  the out of the ordinary!

486
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:10,960
The woman who gets pregnant in her
  conjugal bed doesn't know eroticism!

487
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:23,160
Go beyond words and feelings.

488
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:33,800
The empty, scared head I am...

489
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:39,560
... will only be satisfied in death.

490
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:43,000
Why are you saying this?

491
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:19,640
I waited for her to fall asleep.
  I left in the middle of the night.

492
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:23,400
I don't know how I managed
  to get back to Bangkok.

493
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:26,840
Bee does not exist.
  You dreamed her up.

494
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:31,680
Maybe everything I've lived for
  for some time was only a dream.

495
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:38,520
It's because we are somewhere else.
  Doomed to ludicrous activities.

496
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:42,520
Napoleon used half of his days
  on St. Helena counting spoons.

497
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:45,760
One mustn't give in at any price.

498
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:50,200
One must always be curious. When
  you say this, everybody agrees.

499
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:55,720
But when you talk sex,
  it's a scandal.

500
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:02,600
I am a collector
  because it's very respectable.

501
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:05,800
I collect situations.

502
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:10,280
Take me now.
  You don't know me yet.

503
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:15,120
That would be too easy.
  Let me guide you.

504
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:20,360
This moment is always identical.
  But I will make it unforgettable.

505
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:25,560
Real love is always against nature.

506
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:31,000
Real love is erection, not orgasm.

507
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:37,640
The couple should be outlawed.

508
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:43,240
A third person introduced by force.

509
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:11,960
Wait for me here.

510
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:45,400
Thai-boxing. Have you ever seen it?
  -No.

511
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:50,520
It's a savage sport. You will have
  the privilege of witnessing it.

512
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:55,360
You'll live the fight
  like no one else.

513
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:59,040
There's a prize for the victor.

514
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:24,280
Whom do you prefer?

515
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:24,360
I'm proud as the first day my
  blood flowed. On my 12th birthday.

516
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:31,360
I hate morons, all those laughing
  as if someone tickled them.

517
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:42,560
I am all woman.

518
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:22,400
Daytime is not for the likes of us.

519
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:26,560
What more do you want from me?

520
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:31,760
First of all,
  that you take off your dress.

521
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:39,080
I'm tired.

522
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:47,120
You don't want me, do you, Mario?
  -It's someone else I want.

523
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:51,960
Another Emmanuelle.
  The one I don't know yet.

524
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:55,560
The one you don't even
  know yourself.

525
01:25:55,800 --> 01:26:00,800
One must find the unknown
  through disorder of one's senses.

526
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:09,480
The couple should be outlawed...

527
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:15,600
A third person
  introduced by force...

528
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,600
The couple should be outlawed.

529
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:25,520
A third person introduced by force.
