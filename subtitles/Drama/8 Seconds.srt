1
00:01:20,861 --> 00:01:22,863
Why don't you ride the bulls,
Daddy?

2
00:01:22,863 --> 00:01:24,865
I just ride broncs
bareback, son.

3
00:01:24,865 --> 00:01:25,866
Why?

4
00:01:25,866 --> 00:01:28,869
Tell you the truth,
I'm scared of them.

5
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:32,862
I ain't scared of them.

6
00:01:48,889 --> 00:01:50,891
Hold on tight.

7
00:01:50,891 --> 00:01:52,893
Grab on, grab on.

8
00:01:52,893 --> 00:01:56,886
Go!

9
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,902
Go, Lane, go! Good ride, son!

10
00:02:01,902 --> 00:02:04,905
- Good ride!
- Good ride, cowboy!

11
00:02:04,905 --> 00:02:08,898
Way to go, boy!

12
00:02:23,924 --> 00:02:26,927
We're at the Ardmore Teen Rodeo,
where champions of tomorrow...

13
00:02:26,927 --> 00:02:28,929
come to the youth rodeo arenas.

14
00:02:28,929 --> 00:02:31,932
This is where our youngsters
learn how to cowboy up.

15
00:02:31,932 --> 00:02:33,934
- Do your best, son.
- Thanks, Clyde.

16
00:02:33,934 --> 00:02:35,936
Find the guts, intestinal
fortitude, and the strength...

17
00:02:35,936 --> 00:02:37,938
- I aim to try, sir.
- Hey, Lane.

18
00:02:37,938 --> 00:02:40,941
...it takes to be champion
in this game.

19
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:43,944
Right now we're about
to watch Lane Frost.

20
00:02:43,944 --> 00:02:47,937
His daddy Clyde was a five-time
National Finals rodeo qualifier.

21
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:50,951
- Stay up on your rope.
- Yes, sir.

22
00:02:50,951 --> 00:02:51,952
Reach your feet front.

23
00:02:51,952 --> 00:02:54,955
Don't try to second-guess him.

24
00:02:54,955 --> 00:02:56,957
If you want to ride,
Lane, be the best.

25
00:02:56,957 --> 00:02:58,959
- Yes, sir.
- Bear down.

26
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,961
Sir. OK, boys! OK!

27
00:03:00,961 --> 00:03:01,962
Hold on, Lane!

28
00:03:01,962 --> 00:03:03,964
Get ready for the bulls.

29
00:03:03,964 --> 00:03:06,967
Hey, luck's being
sent in to this kid.

30
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:08,969
Look at his great control...

31
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:10,971
and a fabulous
little bull ride...

32
00:03:10,971 --> 00:03:13,974
right here by one of
your very own Oklahoma cowboys.

33
00:03:13,974 --> 00:03:17,978
Lane Frost
made it to the whistle.

34
00:03:17,978 --> 00:03:19,980
The marking's gonna come up
for this young man...

35
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,982
at eighty-six points...

36
00:03:21,982 --> 00:03:24,985
and you are looking
at your champion rider...

37
00:03:24,985 --> 00:03:26,987
of the Ardmore Teen Rodeo.

38
00:03:26,987 --> 00:03:29,990
He cowboy'd up,
and the judges liked it.

39
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,992
Lane Frost
taking what Daddy told him...

40
00:03:31,992 --> 00:03:35,985
and putting it to work.
Nice job, cowboy.

41
00:03:46,006 --> 00:03:49,009
Lane, come on!

42
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:53,002
You're gonna be late!

43
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:03,023
Breakfast is ready.
You got time.

44
00:04:03,023 --> 00:04:05,025
Did you get those shirts done?

45
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:09,018
Will you sit down?

46
00:04:28,048 --> 00:04:31,051
Lane, I saved you
a little money to take.

47
00:04:31,051 --> 00:04:33,053
Mom, I don't need it.
I been chopping wood.

48
00:04:33,053 --> 00:04:35,055
Just in case you get
into trouble.

49
00:04:35,055 --> 00:04:37,057
It's not my first time
to the rodeo.

50
00:04:37,057 --> 00:04:41,050
But it's the first time you've
rodeoed with Tuff Hedeman.

51
00:04:46,066 --> 00:04:50,059
Tuff, slow down.
You're gonna wake me up.

52
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,083
Where is that stupid idiot
pencilneck son of a bitch?

53
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,085
He'll be here.

54
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:08,088
We're going to have to drive
like hell to get there on time.

55
00:05:08,088 --> 00:05:12,092
That's the way you drive anyway.

56
00:05:12,092 --> 00:05:15,095
Why did I let you
talk me into this?

57
00:05:15,095 --> 00:05:18,098
Because I like him,
and he can share expenses...

58
00:05:18,098 --> 00:05:20,100
and Lane's good.

59
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,101
He ain't that good.

60
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:24,104
He beat you
at the high school finals.

61
00:05:24,104 --> 00:05:26,106
Hey, he got lucky.

62
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:27,107
He is a puss.

63
00:05:27,107 --> 00:05:31,100
You know it, and I know it.

64
00:05:32,112 --> 00:05:34,114
Sit down, Lane.

65
00:05:34,114 --> 00:05:36,116
Need you back Monday
or that hay rots.

66
00:05:36,116 --> 00:05:37,117
Yes, sir, I will be.

67
00:05:37,117 --> 00:05:40,120
He was out there
at four thirty this morning.

68
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,122
Nobody ever accused Lane
of avoiding work.

69
00:05:42,122 --> 00:05:45,125
Rodeo ain't a way
to make a living.

70
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:48,128
Got to be damn good
to make it pay.

71
00:05:48,128 --> 00:05:52,132
That's what I plan on being.

72
00:05:52,132 --> 00:05:56,125
Nice shirt, Lane!

73
00:05:57,137 --> 00:05:59,139
Real pretty.

74
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:01,141
My mom made it.

75
00:06:01,141 --> 00:06:05,145
You ought to pick up a whole lot
of girls in that shirt.

76
00:06:05,145 --> 00:06:08,148
I might want to borrow it.

77
00:06:08,148 --> 00:06:10,150
Ready?

78
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:14,143
Just waiting on you, bud.

79
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,153
I bet you wished
you was going with him.

80
00:06:25,165 --> 00:06:29,169
If the shirt don't get girls,
that stupid hat will.

81
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:31,171
That is an original hat.

82
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:33,173
Is that a joke?
We don't joke in my family.

83
00:06:33,173 --> 00:06:37,177
We're your family now, buddy.

84
00:06:37,177 --> 00:06:39,179
This here feather in my hat's
my trademark.

85
00:06:39,179 --> 00:06:41,181
That's what we need, Tuff...
a trademark.

86
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:45,185
I got one. Hard, full of juice,
and barely fits in my jeans.

87
00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:46,186
Jeez, Tuff!

88
00:06:46,186 --> 00:06:50,179
It's my flask, Lane.
Cody, want some OJ?

89
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,201
Lane, didn't think
you'd make it today.

90
00:07:01,201 --> 00:07:03,203
You never rode with Tuff.

91
00:07:03,203 --> 00:07:04,204
Tuff, you drew Bucky Nightmare.

92
00:07:04,204 --> 00:07:06,206
Hang on. He's a rank one.

93
00:07:06,206 --> 00:07:08,208
That's the kind I like.

94
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:11,211
Our last competitor in
the barrel racing competition...

95
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:13,213
is Kellie Kyle
from Quanah, Texas.

96
00:07:13,213 --> 00:07:17,217
This lady's already won
over $17,500 this year...

97
00:07:17,217 --> 00:07:19,219
a tremendous performance
this early in the season.

98
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:22,222
Kellie's no newcomer
to the sport.

99
00:07:22,222 --> 00:07:23,223
She was the National
High School...

100
00:07:23,223 --> 00:07:26,226
Barrel Racing Champion
back in 1980.

101
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:29,229
She's riding one of
the fastest quarter horses...

102
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:30,230
on the circuit today...

103
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:34,223
that great quarter horse
called Crawford.

104
00:07:35,235 --> 00:07:38,238
Kellie Kyle... the time,
seventeen point three.

105
00:07:38,238 --> 00:07:41,241
That's gonna make her our
Amarillo champion barrel racer.

106
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:45,245
We'll see Kellie at the National
Finals rodeo in December...

107
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:49,249
as one of our top fifteen
ladies in our world standings.

108
00:07:49,249 --> 00:07:52,252
Let's get ready to go down here
with Lane Frost.

109
00:07:52,252 --> 00:07:55,255
Two years ago, he was
the high school champion...

110
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:58,258
You're as pretty as my sister,
but don't ride like her.

111
00:07:58,258 --> 00:08:01,261
This bull's prettier
than your sister.

112
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:04,264
All right.

113
00:08:04,264 --> 00:08:08,268
OK, boys! OK, boys!

114
00:08:08,268 --> 00:08:11,271
It'll be
an automatic disqualification.

115
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:15,264
His entry fee will be added
to that prize money here.

116
00:08:16,276 --> 00:08:17,277
Eighty-five
is what he's trying to beat.

117
00:08:17,277 --> 00:08:20,280
Lane Frost
with a fine bull ride here.

118
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,283
Look at that young man go!

119
00:08:23,283 --> 00:08:26,286
Lane Frost from Lane, Oklahoma.

120
00:08:26,286 --> 00:08:28,288
He's just lucky.

121
00:08:28,288 --> 00:08:31,291
You get a good bull,
that's half your score.

122
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,292
He stays on and rides.

123
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:34,294
That's the other half.

124
00:08:34,294 --> 00:08:37,297
Eighty-three.
Good enough to win second.

125
00:08:37,297 --> 00:08:39,299
Just listen to those people
out there.

126
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,301
You've won a whole lot
of rodeo fans.

127
00:08:41,301 --> 00:08:45,294
Hey, lucky boy,
your shirt ain't pretty no more.

128
00:08:47,307 --> 00:08:51,300
You got a little mud
on your feather there.

129
00:08:53,313 --> 00:08:54,314
You hold good.

130
00:08:54,314 --> 00:08:57,317
He's gonna come blowing
out of there hard.

131
00:08:57,317 --> 00:08:59,319
No. He's gonna start spinning
flatter than a pancake.

132
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:03,323
- He gonna blow.
- He gonna spin.

133
00:09:03,323 --> 00:09:04,324
- He'll blow.
- Spin.

134
00:09:04,324 --> 00:09:06,326
We'll see.

135
00:09:06,326 --> 00:09:08,328
Shut up
and pull my damn rope back.

136
00:09:08,328 --> 00:09:10,330
Make some money, all right?

137
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,332
He gonna blow.

138
00:09:12,332 --> 00:09:14,334
He gonna spin.

139
00:09:14,334 --> 00:09:16,336
- He'll blow.
- Pull me.

140
00:09:16,336 --> 00:09:17,337
He gonna blow.

141
00:09:17,337 --> 00:09:19,339
Gonna spin.

142
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:22,342
He's just gotta stay
on this bull for eight seconds.

143
00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:26,346
Let's go, boys.

144
00:09:26,346 --> 00:09:30,339
Oh, boy, look at that bull
blow out of there!

145
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:37,346
Well, good-bye, $65 entry fee.
Let's pay him off anyway.

146
00:09:38,358 --> 00:09:39,359
That was a fine little try.

147
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:43,363
No score, no money
for Tuff Hedeman.

148
00:09:43,363 --> 00:09:44,364
Ladies and gentlemen...

149
00:09:44,364 --> 00:09:47,367
you can see
that he's very upset about that.

150
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:49,369
"There's a piece
of little finger...

151
00:09:49,369 --> 00:09:50,370
"on a fence out in Cheyenne.

152
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,372
"They had a wild horse race.

153
00:09:52,372 --> 00:09:54,374
"I thought I'd lend a hand.

154
00:09:54,374 --> 00:09:57,377
"I left bone chips
down in Tucson...

155
00:09:57,377 --> 00:09:58,378
"with a doctor and a nurse.

156
00:09:58,378 --> 00:10:02,382
"Gave blood in Oklahoma
just to help me reimburse.

157
00:10:02,382 --> 00:10:05,385
"In Omaha, Nebraska,
I left a chunk of chin.

158
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:07,387
"I tried to find it later...

159
00:10:07,387 --> 00:10:10,390
"but forgot where all I'd been."

160
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,393
There you go.

161
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:14,394
All I'm saying is...

162
00:10:14,394 --> 00:10:17,397
you couldn't bet in
any money standing in the mud.

163
00:10:17,397 --> 00:10:19,399
Told you he blows
out of there, Tuff.

164
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:21,401
If you had any sense,
pretty boy...

165
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:23,403
you'd know he was thinking
about spinning...

166
00:10:23,403 --> 00:10:25,405
and just changed his mind,
is all.

167
00:10:25,405 --> 00:10:29,398
I'm glad one of you's thinking.

168
00:10:32,412 --> 00:10:35,415
I don't mean to tell a feller
his business...

169
00:10:35,415 --> 00:10:38,418
but you better keep
a bend in your arm.

170
00:10:38,418 --> 00:10:39,419
Like this?

171
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:41,421
- Kind of. What's your name?
- Travis.

172
00:10:41,421 --> 00:10:43,423
You want to be a bull rider?

173
00:10:43,423 --> 00:10:45,425
Keep this in mind.

174
00:10:45,425 --> 00:10:47,427
First, stay up on that rope.

175
00:10:47,427 --> 00:10:48,428
Very good. Second thing...

176
00:10:48,428 --> 00:10:52,432
keep your arm real high
and reach out for the front.

177
00:10:52,432 --> 00:10:53,433
Towards the head?

178
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:56,436
Kind of.
Pretend there's a wall there.

179
00:10:56,436 --> 00:10:58,438
That's the bull's territory.
You don't want to be back there.

180
00:10:58,438 --> 00:11:00,440
Third thing?

181
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,442
Hold on with my feet?

182
00:11:02,442 --> 00:11:05,445
Right. Get a good hold.
Bend your legs.

183
00:11:05,445 --> 00:11:08,448
Toes out, get a foot hold,
chest up, arm out.

184
00:11:08,448 --> 00:11:10,450
You gonna cover him fine.
Let's see ya.

185
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,452
All right. That's good.

186
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:15,455
Travis, take care.
I got to go.

187
00:11:15,455 --> 00:11:16,456
Thanks. I appreciate it.

188
00:11:16,456 --> 00:11:17,457
Congratulations, Kellie.

189
00:11:17,457 --> 00:11:19,459
Thanks.

190
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:21,461
You don't remember me, do you?

191
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:25,465
Lane Frost. We met
at the high school finals.

192
00:11:25,465 --> 00:11:27,467
Sure, Lane. How you doing?

193
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:28,468
I'm all right.

194
00:11:28,468 --> 00:11:30,470
I don't usually
watch barrel racing...

195
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:33,473
but you make it look
real interesting.

196
00:11:33,473 --> 00:11:35,475
Well, my horse Crawford
does all the work.

197
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:39,468
What do you think about getting
a bite to eat real quick?

198
00:11:41,481 --> 00:11:43,483
Oh, I'm with my mom.

199
00:11:43,483 --> 00:11:45,485
Well, your mom's got
to eat, too.

200
00:11:45,485 --> 00:11:47,487
This is my mom Carolyn Kyle.

201
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:49,489
This is Lane Frost.

202
00:11:49,489 --> 00:11:51,491
Miss Carolyn,
it's certainly a pleasure.

203
00:11:51,491 --> 00:11:54,494
- Quite a ride today.
- Thank you, ma'am.

204
00:11:54,494 --> 00:11:56,496
Did you watch him?

205
00:11:56,496 --> 00:11:58,498
Kellie doesn't like
bull riding much.

206
00:11:58,498 --> 00:12:00,500
Well, it's a little rough.

207
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,502
We was fixing to eat.

208
00:12:02,502 --> 00:12:03,503
I'd appreciate it
if you'd join us.

209
00:12:03,503 --> 00:12:06,506
Lane, let's go, butthole.

210
00:12:06,506 --> 00:12:09,509
Well, I guess I got to go.

211
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:10,510
Where y'all up next?

212
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,512
Nacogdoches, next weekend.

213
00:12:12,512 --> 00:12:14,514
I'm up at Nacogdoches
next weekend.

214
00:12:14,514 --> 00:12:16,516
Let's eat there.

215
00:12:16,516 --> 00:12:18,518
That sounds good,
doesn't it, honey?

216
00:12:18,518 --> 00:12:20,520
- Sure.
- All right.

217
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,513
Well, y'all take care.

218
00:12:28,528 --> 00:12:29,529
I don't like bull riders.

219
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:31,531
They're little men
with big egos.

220
00:12:31,531 --> 00:12:33,533
Lane seems kind of different.

221
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:36,536
He's got a skinny butt
like the rest of them.

222
00:12:36,536 --> 00:12:37,537
I'd judge a man more...

223
00:12:37,537 --> 00:12:39,539
by the size of his heart
than his rear.

224
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:42,542
It's likely to do you more good.

225
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:46,535
Come on, Crawford.

226
00:12:48,548 --> 00:12:51,551
Tuff, how you gonna cover
your entry fee in San Angelo?

227
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:53,553
- Shut up, Cody.
- Shoot, I'd cover you.

228
00:12:53,553 --> 00:12:54,554
I don't want your money, Lane.

229
00:12:54,554 --> 00:12:57,557
I got prize money
and that wood-chopping money.

230
00:12:57,557 --> 00:12:59,559
All right.
I'll pay you back when I win.

231
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:01,561
I guess I can hold out
that long.

232
00:13:01,561 --> 00:13:05,554
Hey, I make the jokes
in this family, all right?

233
00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:11,571
I just live down the road,
and I got cable.

234
00:13:11,571 --> 00:13:15,575
Oh, darling,
that does sound tempting, but...

235
00:13:15,575 --> 00:13:19,568
it just won't come off.

236
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:24,584
Well, I did pretty good.
I got second.

237
00:13:24,584 --> 00:13:26,586
Ask him when he's coming home.

238
00:13:26,586 --> 00:13:28,588
I won five hundred dollars.

239
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:32,592
With a little more trying,
you could've won a thousand.

240
00:13:32,592 --> 00:13:34,594
Yeah, you're right.

241
00:13:34,594 --> 00:13:36,596
Who do you think's
had the most wrecks?

242
00:13:36,596 --> 00:13:38,598
Charlie Sampson, you know that.

243
00:13:38,598 --> 00:13:39,599
Busted his ankle, his wrist...

244
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:42,602
his sternum,
and his leg a time or two.

245
00:13:42,602 --> 00:13:43,603
Punctured his lungs, too.

246
00:13:43,603 --> 00:13:45,605
- Who you talking about?
- Charlie Sampson.

247
00:13:45,605 --> 00:13:46,606
I seen him bust his head.

248
00:13:46,606 --> 00:13:49,609
At Cow Palace,
got his ear ripped off.

249
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:52,612
- He never broke his nose.
- Why not?

250
00:13:52,612 --> 00:13:54,614
Just lucky, I reckon.

251
00:13:54,614 --> 00:13:58,618
Hey, you boys kicked ass today.

252
00:13:58,618 --> 00:14:01,621
I wanna buy you all a drink.

253
00:14:01,621 --> 00:14:03,623
- You're a gentleman.
- I'll have a Coke.

254
00:14:03,623 --> 00:14:05,625
I ain't buying nobody no Coke.

255
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,627
I don't want anything, then.

256
00:14:07,627 --> 00:14:09,629
I said I'm buying you a drink.

257
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:11,631
Buy him what he wants, fat boy.

258
00:14:11,631 --> 00:14:15,635
I don't give a shit
what he wants.

259
00:14:15,635 --> 00:14:18,638
You fat-ass,
low-life shit-for-brains!

260
00:14:18,638 --> 00:14:19,639
Come on, shit-for-brains!

261
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:21,641
You're a bronc rider, ain't you?

262
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:22,642
That's right.

263
00:14:22,642 --> 00:14:24,644
What's your name?

264
00:14:24,644 --> 00:14:25,645
Shithead!

265
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:27,647
- John.
- That's a great name.

266
00:14:27,647 --> 00:14:31,651
Lane Frost.
How the heck are you?

267
00:14:31,651 --> 00:14:34,654
What the hell's Lane doing,
running for mayor?

268
00:14:34,654 --> 00:14:36,656
He's probably running
for dog catcher.

269
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:40,660
Let's shoot a game of pool.

270
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,663
So when did your daddy
quit rodeo?

271
00:14:43,663 --> 00:14:45,665
I guess about 1968.

272
00:14:45,665 --> 00:14:47,667
Decided he was gonna
stay home on the ranch.

273
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:49,669
Before that,
top fifteen cowboys...

274
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:51,671
year in and year out.

275
00:14:51,671 --> 00:14:53,673
I'm dancing with her, all right?

276
00:14:53,673 --> 00:14:56,676
Get your hands off my girl!

277
00:14:56,676 --> 00:15:00,669
Come on!

278
00:15:01,681 --> 00:15:02,682
Wait!

279
00:15:02,682 --> 00:15:04,684
Come on, come on!

280
00:15:04,684 --> 00:15:06,686
Out the door! Come on!

281
00:15:06,686 --> 00:15:09,689
Outside, let's go!

282
00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:11,691
Get him, Lane! Come on!

283
00:15:11,691 --> 00:15:12,692
I got to piss!

284
00:15:12,692 --> 00:15:14,694
Get him in the car, Lane.

285
00:15:14,694 --> 00:15:17,697
You try gettin' him in the car!

286
00:15:17,697 --> 00:15:21,690
No shit, Lane,
I gotta take a piss!

287
00:15:26,706 --> 00:15:30,699
You better run!

288
00:15:32,712 --> 00:15:36,705
You didn't even have a drink
tonight, did you, Lane?

289
00:15:37,717 --> 00:15:40,720
You didn't even have a beer.

290
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,723
I don't drink a whole lot.

291
00:15:43,723 --> 00:15:46,726
Can't be a cowboy
and a nice guy, Lane.

292
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:47,727
It don't work like that.

293
00:15:47,727 --> 00:15:50,730
We got an image to uphold.

294
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,732
Drinking, loving,
fighting cowboys.

295
00:15:52,732 --> 00:15:56,736
Tuff thinks he's John Wayne.

296
00:15:56,736 --> 00:15:57,737
You're damn right.

297
00:15:57,737 --> 00:16:00,740
We're a tradition...

298
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,741
last of a dying breed.

299
00:16:01,741 --> 00:16:05,734
Maybe there's a reason
for that dying part.

300
00:16:06,746 --> 00:16:09,749
Shit. These two-bit rodeos
don't mean nothing.

301
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:12,752
Win a couple hundred
here and there.

302
00:16:12,752 --> 00:16:13,753
It's all bullshit.

303
00:16:13,753 --> 00:16:17,757
Cheyenne, Houston, Del Rio...
that's where the big money is.

304
00:16:17,757 --> 00:16:20,760
That's where the real cowboys
are gonna be...

305
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,753
and, pretty boy, where you'll
get your skinny ass kicked.

306
00:16:26,766 --> 00:16:28,768
How's come?

307
00:16:28,768 --> 00:16:30,770
'Cause you ain't got
what it takes.

308
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,773
You ain't goddamn good enough.

309
00:16:33,773 --> 00:16:37,777
You're a puss.

310
00:16:37,777 --> 00:16:41,770
Dream about that.

311
00:16:56,796 --> 00:16:59,799
When Tuff's being mean
and hateful like that...

312
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:03,792
your best bet's
just to ignore him.

313
00:17:05,805 --> 00:17:09,798
He's gonna be his normal
sweet self in the morning.

314
00:17:17,817 --> 00:17:21,810
Lord, I love this.

315
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:05,854
Tuff, you wet the bed!

316
00:18:08,868 --> 00:18:11,871
Urine ain't something
that can be played with.

317
00:18:11,871 --> 00:18:14,874
You can't ride a bull
with no diaper rash.

318
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:18,867
Cody, how you put up
with him peeing in the bed?

319
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:21,881
Well, you get used to it.

320
00:18:21,881 --> 00:18:24,884
Well, I don't want
to get used to it.

321
00:18:24,884 --> 00:18:28,888
Lane Frost on Panda Bear
here at Nacogdoches, Texas.

322
00:18:28,888 --> 00:18:31,891
What a gutsy ride here
by Lane Frost.

323
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:33,893
Fifteen to two thousand pounds
of animal.

324
00:18:33,893 --> 00:18:36,896
Look at Lane Frost
getting some money time.

325
00:18:36,896 --> 00:18:40,900
Gonna be a money ride here
this afternoon for Lane Frost!

326
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,893
The best bull rider today.

327
00:18:45,905 --> 00:18:46,906
Nice ride today, Lane.

328
00:18:46,906 --> 00:18:50,899
- Thank you. Appreciate it.
- You betcha.

329
00:18:58,918 --> 00:19:00,920
So, are we gonna go
get something to eat?

330
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,921
What?

331
00:19:01,921 --> 00:19:03,923
Remember Amarillo?

332
00:19:03,923 --> 00:19:05,925
We said we'd get us
a bite to eat.

333
00:19:05,925 --> 00:19:09,929
Lane, I forgot. I'm sorry.
I made other plans.

334
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:13,933
Well, heck, I been planning this
for a whole week.

335
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:16,936
I'm really sorry.

336
00:19:16,936 --> 00:19:20,940
Your mom can come with us
if you want.

337
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,933
Well...

338
00:19:29,949 --> 00:19:31,951
I don't rodeo full-time.

339
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:33,953
I'm in college.

340
00:19:33,953 --> 00:19:35,955
What for?

341
00:19:35,955 --> 00:19:38,958
It's a sports medicine program.

342
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,960
I love helping people,
and I love rodeo...

343
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,953
so it's a way
to put them both together.

344
00:19:45,965 --> 00:19:46,966
I got so many plans.

345
00:19:46,966 --> 00:19:50,970
I don't know how
I'm gonna get them all done.

346
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,973
Them plans
include riding a bull?

347
00:19:53,973 --> 00:19:57,977
Not hardly.

348
00:19:57,977 --> 00:20:00,980
Don't you ever worry
about getting injured?

349
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,983
I'm holding together
better than they thought.

350
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:06,986
They say it's not
if you get hurt riding bulls.

351
00:20:06,986 --> 00:20:07,987
It's how bad.

352
00:20:07,987 --> 00:20:09,989
Heck, them bulls
ain't got nothing against you.

353
00:20:09,989 --> 00:20:12,992
They just want to buck you off
and get on with their business.

354
00:20:12,992 --> 00:20:16,996
People hurt you a lot sooner.

355
00:20:16,996 --> 00:20:21,000
What do you mean?

356
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,993
Nothing. It don't matter.

357
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:29,998
I saw you talking to that kid
last week at the rodeo.

358
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:35,014
Nobody else does that.

359
00:20:35,014 --> 00:20:38,017
I remember
when I was a little kid...

360
00:20:38,017 --> 00:20:41,020
my dad took me
to this rodeo in Utah.

361
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:45,024
It was the first time I got
to sneak behind the chutes...

362
00:20:45,024 --> 00:20:46,025
and see all them cowboys.

363
00:20:46,025 --> 00:20:49,028
I got back there...

364
00:20:49,028 --> 00:20:51,030
they didn't want nothing
to do with me...

365
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,032
so I said right there...

366
00:20:53,032 --> 00:20:55,034
if I ever get here,
I'm talking to everybody.

367
00:20:55,034 --> 00:20:59,038
Them little kids
need somebody to look up to.

368
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:01,040
I look up to my dad.

369
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,042
Some kids don't got that.

370
00:21:03,042 --> 00:21:07,046
If I can be that for them,
that's part of the job.

371
00:21:07,046 --> 00:21:08,047
Rodeo's not
just about making money.

372
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:10,049
It's about being your best...

373
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:13,052
and helping others
be their best.

374
00:21:13,052 --> 00:21:15,054
This is something
I've dreamed about...

375
00:21:15,054 --> 00:21:19,058
ever since I was little,
and now I'm living the dream.

376
00:21:19,058 --> 00:21:23,051
How's your What-A-Chicken?

377
00:21:25,064 --> 00:21:27,066
It's fine.

378
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:31,059
Good.

379
00:21:32,071 --> 00:21:34,073
Barrel racing's
more than just riding.

380
00:21:34,073 --> 00:21:37,076
When I'm running Crawford,
it's like I'm part of him.

381
00:21:37,076 --> 00:21:39,078
I got to give him all my trust.

382
00:21:39,078 --> 00:21:42,081
Bull riding
ain't all that different.

383
00:21:42,081 --> 00:21:44,083
I got a lot of respect
for them bulls.

384
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:47,086
When one comes busting
out of that gate...

385
00:21:47,086 --> 00:21:50,089
it's like
you're tied onto a tornado.

386
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:53,092
You're not trying
to break his spirit...

387
00:21:53,092 --> 00:21:55,094
you're just trying to stay
with him jump for jump.

388
00:21:55,094 --> 00:21:57,096
It's like every wild
and free thing in the world...

389
00:21:57,096 --> 00:22:00,099
is right there
in the palm of your hand.

390
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:02,101
Probably sounds
pretty stupid to you.

391
00:22:02,101 --> 00:22:05,104
No, that's not stupid.

392
00:22:05,104 --> 00:22:09,097
I know what you mean.

393
00:22:12,111 --> 00:22:14,113
I'm real glad
you remembered about dinner.

394
00:22:14,113 --> 00:22:18,106
I wouldn't forget
something like that.

395
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,123
I'm riding in Lubbock
next weekend.

396
00:22:24,123 --> 00:22:26,125
We're up in Lubbock.

397
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:30,129
I guess we'll see you there.

398
00:22:30,129 --> 00:22:34,122
Yeah, I hope so.

399
00:22:37,136 --> 00:22:41,140
Thanks for dinner.

400
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:45,133
No. That's my pleasure, really.

401
00:22:48,147 --> 00:22:52,140
Well...

402
00:22:54,153 --> 00:22:58,146
Good night, Lane.

403
00:23:26,185 --> 00:23:29,188
You sure been seeing a lot
of Kellie the last few months.

404
00:23:29,188 --> 00:23:31,190
She was upset
last time you got together.

405
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,192
What are you talking about?

406
00:23:33,192 --> 00:23:35,194
I heard you stayed on
eight seconds...

407
00:23:35,194 --> 00:23:39,187
then jumped off
and threw your hat in the air!

408
00:23:54,213 --> 00:23:56,215
I'll just be a minute.

409
00:23:56,215 --> 00:24:00,208
Better hope Tuff doesn't wake up
and find out we're in Texas.

410
00:24:06,225 --> 00:24:09,228
We're just passing through.

411
00:24:09,228 --> 00:24:12,231
Thought I'd stop by.

412
00:24:12,231 --> 00:24:15,234
I'm glad you did.

413
00:24:15,234 --> 00:24:19,227
Good.

414
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,242
Where'd y'all come from?

415
00:24:23,242 --> 00:24:26,245
California.

416
00:24:26,245 --> 00:24:28,247
Where you headed?

417
00:24:28,247 --> 00:24:31,250
We going to Nebraska.

418
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:35,254
Lane, Texas isn't on the way
from California to Nebraska.

419
00:24:35,254 --> 00:24:39,247
Well, I never did have much
of a sense of direction.

420
00:24:42,261 --> 00:24:45,264
You got real pretty land
here, Kellie.

421
00:24:45,264 --> 00:24:47,266
Thanks.

422
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:51,270
Sure would like to have me
something like this someday.

423
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:54,273
Of course, I just grew up
on a little ranch.

424
00:24:54,273 --> 00:24:58,266
Lane, that doesn't matter to me.

425
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:02,281
We're just country people.

426
00:25:02,281 --> 00:25:05,284
Country people
are the best kind...

427
00:25:05,284 --> 00:25:09,277
hardworking,
down to earth, sincere.

428
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,292
How about if they ride bulls?

429
00:25:13,292 --> 00:25:17,285
Guess everybody's
a little peculiar.

430
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:23,302
Where are we now?

431
00:25:23,302 --> 00:25:27,295
Quanah, Texas...
home of Kellie Kyle.

432
00:25:28,307 --> 00:25:30,309
What did you say?

433
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:34,313
You heard me.

434
00:25:34,313 --> 00:25:37,316
There are girls
all over the rodeo.

435
00:25:37,316 --> 00:25:41,320
- Isn't that right, Cleatis?
- Yeah, there are.

436
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,324
Why in the hell do we have
to detour five hundred miles...

437
00:25:45,324 --> 00:25:47,326
just for this one?

438
00:25:47,326 --> 00:25:51,330
Love knows no boundaries.

439
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:55,334
A puss in love.

440
00:25:55,334 --> 00:25:59,338
It's pitiful.

441
00:25:59,338 --> 00:26:01,340
You know, Kellie...

442
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,342
Del Rio's the first real big
bull ride of the year.

443
00:26:03,342 --> 00:26:06,345
I'd be plumb tickled
if you'd watch me.

444
00:26:06,345 --> 00:26:09,348
I'd love to, Lane,
but I got finals.

445
00:26:09,348 --> 00:26:12,351
Heck, that ain't no problem.

446
00:26:12,351 --> 00:26:16,344
Study during them other events
and look up when I come on.

447
00:26:17,356 --> 00:26:20,359
I'll think about it.

448
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:22,361
I expect I'd best go.

449
00:26:22,361 --> 00:26:24,363
Y'all want to stay for supper?

450
00:26:24,363 --> 00:26:26,365
We got plenty.

451
00:26:26,365 --> 00:26:30,358
No. We really should go.

452
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:33,372
Thanks for stopping by.

453
00:26:33,372 --> 00:26:36,375
You got you
a heck of a place here.

454
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:37,376
Yes, sir.

455
00:26:37,376 --> 00:26:39,378
Be about perfect
for the wedding.

456
00:26:39,378 --> 00:26:41,380
What wedding?

457
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:45,384
Yours and mine.

458
00:26:45,384 --> 00:26:47,386
I'm glad you told me.

459
00:26:47,386 --> 00:26:51,379
I'll try to keep the day open.

460
00:26:55,394 --> 00:26:59,387
Lane, you never even kissed me.

461
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,402
Well, what did you expect
from an Okie...

462
00:27:03,402 --> 00:27:07,395
that can't get
from California to Nebraska?

463
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:15,403
I don't chew tobacco or nothin'.

464
00:28:14,473 --> 00:28:17,476
Check this out. Erwin Williams...
Tulsa, Oklahoma.

465
00:28:17,476 --> 00:28:18,477
The bull is White Lightning.

466
00:28:18,477 --> 00:28:20,479
Stay with him, Erwin.

467
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:22,481
He's got a good seat.

468
00:28:22,481 --> 00:28:24,483
It looks like
he's gonna make it.

469
00:28:24,483 --> 00:28:26,485
He did!

470
00:28:26,485 --> 00:28:30,478
This is it, boys...
big time, big money.

471
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:34,493
Seventy-nine points!
A seventy-nine!

472
00:28:34,493 --> 00:28:36,495
Tuff, look over there.
That's Gary LaFew, man!

473
00:28:36,495 --> 00:28:39,498
We're bull riding
with the World Champ!

474
00:28:39,498 --> 00:28:42,501
That's what they'll
be saying about us someday.

475
00:28:42,501 --> 00:28:43,502
"Ain't that Lane Frost?

476
00:28:43,502 --> 00:28:45,504
"And look over there.
There's Tuff Hedeman.

477
00:28:45,504 --> 00:28:49,497
"I did not know he was
such a handsome son of a gun."

478
00:28:50,509 --> 00:28:53,512
Did you see that, Cody?

479
00:28:53,512 --> 00:28:54,513
He actually got a joke.

480
00:28:54,513 --> 00:28:57,516
Lane Frost
has a sense of humor.

481
00:28:57,516 --> 00:28:59,518
He ain't as dumb as I thought.

482
00:28:59,518 --> 00:29:01,520
I can't be that dumb, boys.

483
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,522
Doing what I love.

484
00:29:03,522 --> 00:29:04,523
Hey, there's Red Rock!

485
00:29:04,523 --> 00:29:06,525
Casey Canby on Red Rock.

486
00:29:06,525 --> 00:29:10,529
That makes 250 victims
that Red Rock's got.

487
00:29:10,529 --> 00:29:13,532
That boy only lasted
about four seconds.

488
00:29:13,532 --> 00:29:16,535
I'd give anything
for a chance at Red Rock.

489
00:29:16,535 --> 00:29:18,537
Forget about him.

490
00:29:18,537 --> 00:29:21,540
Think about Savage Seven,
'cause you're up.

491
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,541
...Coming into chute
number three.

492
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:26,545
Riding him will be
Lane Frost from Oklahoma.

493
00:29:26,545 --> 00:29:28,547
OK, boys! OK, boys!

494
00:29:28,547 --> 00:29:30,549
Stay with him, Lane Frost!

495
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:33,552
Here's another one riding
for the championship.

496
00:29:33,552 --> 00:29:34,553
Stay with him!

497
00:29:34,553 --> 00:29:36,555
Don't you dare give up, son.

498
00:29:36,555 --> 00:29:38,557
Bull turning to the left
and right again.

499
00:29:38,557 --> 00:29:41,560
So far with a pretty good seat.

500
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,562
Everything looking good
for Lane Frost.

501
00:29:43,562 --> 00:29:45,564
There's
the eight-second whistle.

502
00:29:45,564 --> 00:29:49,568
No score for Lane Frost.

503
00:29:49,568 --> 00:29:51,570
Lane needs
a magnificent ride tomorrow...

504
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:53,572
to be eligible
for that prize money.

505
00:29:53,572 --> 00:29:56,575
Soon as we get his condition
from our paramedics...

506
00:29:56,575 --> 00:30:00,568
Lay back.

507
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,581
It's OK. I'm with Lane.

508
00:30:02,581 --> 00:30:04,583
- You can't go in right now.
- Please, sir.

509
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:08,576
You'll have to wait outside.

510
00:30:13,592 --> 00:30:16,595
Is my dick still there?

511
00:30:16,595 --> 00:30:18,597
It's hanging by a thread.

512
00:30:18,597 --> 00:30:20,599
- Don't look.
- You don't want to see it.

513
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:22,601
Cody, is he all right?

514
00:30:22,601 --> 00:30:25,604
He's going to be fine, now.

515
00:30:25,604 --> 00:30:27,606
He won't be a romantic buckaroo
for a while...

516
00:30:27,606 --> 00:30:31,599
but he's going to be fine.

517
00:30:36,615 --> 00:30:39,618
You don't have to babysit me.

518
00:30:39,618 --> 00:30:41,620
I think I'm going
to stick around...

519
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:45,613
and see how far them balls
swell up, see if they pop.

520
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:50,618
Biggest money ride so far
this year, and I fall off.

521
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:52,631
Maybe my dad's right.

522
00:30:52,631 --> 00:30:54,633
I could rodeo my whole life...

523
00:30:54,633 --> 00:30:56,635
end up worse off
than when I started.

524
00:30:56,635 --> 00:30:58,637
You could.

525
00:30:58,637 --> 00:31:00,639
I seen old cowboys.

526
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:02,641
Rodeo beat 'em up so bad...

527
00:31:02,641 --> 00:31:05,644
they can't hardly get out
the bed come morning.

528
00:31:05,644 --> 00:31:09,648
I don't want that.

529
00:31:09,648 --> 00:31:13,652
Well, maybe you ought
to just quit, Lane.

530
00:31:13,652 --> 00:31:15,654
Go home,
work your daddy's ranch...

531
00:31:15,654 --> 00:31:18,657
live to be a hundred...

532
00:31:18,657 --> 00:31:22,661
sit in your rocking chair
and watch the sun go down.

533
00:31:22,661 --> 00:31:24,663
That'd be nice, wouldn't it?

534
00:31:24,663 --> 00:31:27,666
Real special.

535
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:31,670
Did you hear me say anything
about quitting?

536
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:35,663
Just before you croak...

537
00:31:36,675 --> 00:31:38,677
one last thought's
going to keep going through...

538
00:31:38,677 --> 00:31:42,670
that pretty little head of yours
over and over again...

539
00:31:44,683 --> 00:31:46,685
I'm a puss.

540
00:31:46,685 --> 00:31:49,688
I was the best goddamn
bull rider in the circuit...

541
00:31:49,688 --> 00:31:50,689
and I chickened out.

542
00:31:50,689 --> 00:31:52,691
Hell, the best?

543
00:31:52,691 --> 00:31:54,693
You always tell me
I ain't no good.

544
00:31:54,693 --> 00:31:57,696
If you believe everything
you hear, God damn it...

545
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:00,699
you're dumber
than I thought, Lane!

546
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:04,703
Quit.
That'd be fine with me.

547
00:32:04,703 --> 00:32:07,706
I wouldn't have to wake up
every goddamn morning...

548
00:32:07,706 --> 00:32:08,707
to your pretty-boy face.

549
00:32:08,707 --> 00:32:10,709
Me and Cody would get
down the road faster...

550
00:32:10,709 --> 00:32:12,711
if we didn't have to wait
for you signing autographs...

551
00:32:12,711 --> 00:32:16,715
for every snot-nose little kid
at every goddamn rodeo!

552
00:32:16,715 --> 00:32:18,717
All right.

553
00:32:18,717 --> 00:32:20,719
I got two words to say to you.

554
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:21,720
Yeah, I know. Just...

555
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,722
That ain't it.

556
00:32:23,722 --> 00:32:26,725
What is it?

557
00:32:26,725 --> 00:32:30,718
Cowboy up.

558
00:32:46,745 --> 00:32:49,748
You're a puss.

559
00:32:49,748 --> 00:32:53,741
Lane Frost,
who got banged up yesterday...

560
00:32:54,753 --> 00:32:56,755
Mind your business.

561
00:32:56,755 --> 00:32:59,758
You got the guts.
Now comes the glory.

562
00:32:59,758 --> 00:33:01,760
Go, Lane!

563
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,761
All right, now.

564
00:33:02,761 --> 00:33:06,765
The bull they call
Double Trouble.

565
00:33:06,765 --> 00:33:10,758
OK, boys! OK, boys!

566
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:14,773
Look at that kid ride!

567
00:33:14,773 --> 00:33:16,775
Just picture perfect.

568
00:33:16,775 --> 00:33:19,778
This guy's not making
one bumble at all!

569
00:33:19,778 --> 00:33:22,781
Lane, come on!

570
00:33:22,781 --> 00:33:24,783
Look at this rider.

571
00:33:24,783 --> 00:33:26,785
This young man's on.

572
00:33:26,785 --> 00:33:29,788
Look at Lane Frost go
on Double Trouble!

573
00:33:29,788 --> 00:33:32,791
Lane, stay right there on him!

574
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:34,793
You're right there!

575
00:33:34,793 --> 00:33:35,794
You see that?

576
00:33:35,794 --> 00:33:39,798
Way to go, Lane!

577
00:33:39,798 --> 00:33:43,802
Lane Frost... a textbook ride
by the Oklahoma cowboy.

578
00:33:43,802 --> 00:33:47,806
I'm told by judges we got
a forty-five margin on one side.

579
00:33:47,806 --> 00:33:50,809
Forty-five on the other.

580
00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:53,812
Ninety points for Lane Frost!

581
00:33:53,812 --> 00:33:57,816
Ninety points on that ride.

582
00:33:57,816 --> 00:33:59,818
There's a guy
the doctors suggested...

583
00:33:59,818 --> 00:34:01,820
ought to stay in bed...

584
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,813
comes out and turns in
a ninety-point ride.

585
00:34:07,826 --> 00:34:10,829
I thought he was going
to try the right.

586
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:12,831
Don't second-guess a bull.

587
00:34:12,831 --> 00:34:14,833
He could've throwed you
out the back door.

588
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:18,837
Look, your weight's
all on the wrong leg.

589
00:34:18,837 --> 00:34:21,840
Must've done something right.
I got second place.

590
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,833
You just lucky
the other boys rode so poor.

591
00:34:32,851 --> 00:34:34,853
There's a guy
the doctors suggested...

592
00:34:34,853 --> 00:34:35,854
ought to stay in bed...

593
00:34:35,854 --> 00:34:39,847
comes out here and turns in
a ninety-point ride.

594
00:34:57,876 --> 00:34:58,877
I thought you was up
helping my mama.

595
00:34:58,877 --> 00:35:01,880
Lane, what's wrong?

596
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,883
Nothing. I'm fine.

597
00:35:04,883 --> 00:35:07,886
Your mom's great.

598
00:35:07,886 --> 00:35:10,889
I've never been brought home
to meet the folks before.

599
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:14,893
She made me feel right at home.

600
00:35:14,893 --> 00:35:17,896
I haven't had a chance
to visit with your dad yet.

601
00:35:17,896 --> 00:35:18,897
He's great.

602
00:35:18,897 --> 00:35:21,900
If I do half
what he's done in his life...

603
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,901
I'll be doing good.

604
00:35:22,901 --> 00:35:25,904
He's kept this ranch going
with no money.

605
00:35:25,904 --> 00:35:26,905
Ain't like your family, Kellie.

606
00:35:26,905 --> 00:35:29,908
My daddy ain't no president
of a bank.

607
00:35:29,908 --> 00:35:31,910
Everything we got
he worked for.

608
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,912
Gets up at five every morning...

609
00:35:33,912 --> 00:35:36,915
don't stop till
after dark every day.

610
00:35:36,915 --> 00:35:39,918
You want to talk about
what's bothering you?

611
00:35:39,918 --> 00:35:41,920
Nothing's bothering me!

612
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,913
I'm fine, I told you.

613
00:35:47,926 --> 00:35:51,919
But if you ever need to talk
about anything, talk to me?

614
00:35:54,933 --> 00:35:58,926
Nothing you could say or do
would make you less in my eyes.

615
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,943
I love you.

616
00:36:04,943 --> 00:36:07,946
You don't have to be
perfect for me.

617
00:36:07,946 --> 00:36:10,949
You mean that?

618
00:36:10,949 --> 00:36:13,952
You may have to prove it.

619
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,954
I will.

620
00:36:15,954 --> 00:36:19,947
Right now
I'm covered in horseshit.

621
00:36:56,995 --> 00:37:00,999
You're a great dancer.

622
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:02,000
Sorry I'm so surprised.

623
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,003
I took a couple of lessons...

624
00:37:05,003 --> 00:37:08,006
'cause I knowed
you was looking forward to it.

625
00:37:08,006 --> 00:37:10,008
Whatever it is, Kellie...

626
00:37:10,008 --> 00:37:12,010
I'll always do my best for you.

627
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:15,013
I'll do my best for you,
too, Lane.

628
00:37:15,013 --> 00:37:17,015
If I ever mess up...

629
00:37:17,015 --> 00:37:20,018
you just take
an old frying pan to my head.

630
00:37:20,018 --> 00:37:22,020
I'll sic Red Rock on you.

631
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:26,013
He'll take care of you.

632
00:37:47,045 --> 00:37:51,049
Mrs. Frost,
would you care to dance?

633
00:37:51,049 --> 00:37:54,052
No, thank you, Cody.
But thanks for asking.

634
00:37:54,052 --> 00:37:56,054
It'd be my pleasure.

635
00:37:56,054 --> 00:38:00,047
I appreciate it.

636
00:39:27,145 --> 00:39:31,149
What are you thinking about?

637
00:39:31,149 --> 00:39:32,150
Denver.

638
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:36,143
Draw me some good bulls there,
I might get a check.

639
00:39:37,155 --> 00:39:40,158
Lane, maybe I should quit school
for a while.

640
00:39:40,158 --> 00:39:42,160
If you're traveling
all the time...

641
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,162
we'll never see each other.

642
00:39:44,162 --> 00:39:46,164
I can always finish later.

643
00:39:46,164 --> 00:39:48,166
Whatever you want.

644
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:51,169
We could rodeo together.

645
00:39:51,169 --> 00:39:55,173
Be together all the time.

646
00:39:55,173 --> 00:39:57,175
What about Tuff and Cody?

647
00:39:57,175 --> 00:40:01,168
There's lots of guys
who can buddy with them.

648
00:40:03,181 --> 00:40:07,185
You are a prettier sight
to wake up to in the morning...

649
00:40:07,185 --> 00:40:11,178
than Tuff Hedeman,
and that's for sure.

650
00:40:18,196 --> 00:40:22,189
I don't want to be away
from you for one minute.

651
00:40:24,202 --> 00:40:28,195
I don't know how I'm going to be
at this husband stuff.

652
00:40:29,207 --> 00:40:33,211
You'll be fine.

653
00:40:33,211 --> 00:40:35,213
I guess it's like bull riding.

654
00:40:35,213 --> 00:40:38,216
Just get on and hope
you don't get bucked off.

655
00:40:38,216 --> 00:40:42,209
Thanks a lot.

656
00:40:54,232 --> 00:40:56,234
Tuff Hedeman...

657
00:40:56,234 --> 00:41:00,238
Twisted toros in the Arizona
dirt this Christmas season.

658
00:41:00,238 --> 00:41:02,240
Hey, taking a bull
down here today.

659
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,242
This cowboy
needs the Christmas cash...

660
00:41:04,242 --> 00:41:08,235
and he's taking the kind of ride
that paychecks are made out of.

661
00:41:10,248 --> 00:41:13,251
Good enough to win first place.

662
00:41:13,251 --> 00:41:16,254
Tuff Hedeman and Cody Lambert
take home first and second.

663
00:41:16,254 --> 00:41:19,257
You've won $36,000 so far
in 1985.

664
00:41:19,257 --> 00:41:21,259
What's the biggest reason
you're competing professionally?

665
00:41:21,259 --> 00:41:24,262
I suppose mostly it's the money.

666
00:41:24,262 --> 00:41:26,264
That's how we make our living...

667
00:41:26,264 --> 00:41:30,268
Cody and I win,
Lane gets bucked off...

668
00:41:30,268 --> 00:41:33,271
and they still want
to talk to him.

669
00:41:33,271 --> 00:41:35,273
Go figure.

670
00:41:35,273 --> 00:41:37,275
Buy you a beer, Tuff?

671
00:41:37,275 --> 00:41:38,276
Buy you one, Kel.

672
00:41:38,276 --> 00:41:40,278
Come on.

673
00:41:40,278 --> 00:41:43,281
If they say there's one
that can't be rid...

674
00:41:43,281 --> 00:41:45,283
that's the one I want.

675
00:41:45,283 --> 00:41:47,285
Y'all can stay with us
whenever you want.

676
00:41:47,285 --> 00:41:49,287
Just treat me
like one of the boys.

677
00:41:49,287 --> 00:41:51,289
You might regret that.

678
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:54,292
I've been around rodeo
my whole life.

679
00:41:54,292 --> 00:41:57,295
You ain't been in the bathroom
after five bull riders.

680
00:41:57,295 --> 00:42:00,298
Don't worry. I'm pretty tough.

681
00:42:00,298 --> 00:42:02,300
I thought I was Tuff.

682
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,301
Two beers.

683
00:42:03,301 --> 00:42:06,304
I.D.?

684
00:42:06,304 --> 00:42:10,308
Gotcha.

685
00:42:10,308 --> 00:42:14,301
How'd you get the name Tuff?

686
00:42:15,313 --> 00:42:17,315
When I was four years old...

687
00:42:17,315 --> 00:42:20,318
I got my hand slammed
in the car door.

688
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:22,320
Never did cry or nothing.

689
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,323
So they started
calling me Tough Nut.

690
00:42:25,323 --> 00:42:27,325
It got shortened.

691
00:42:27,325 --> 00:42:31,318
What's your real name?

692
00:42:33,331 --> 00:42:37,324
Richard.

693
00:42:40,338 --> 00:42:44,342
He's pretty special to me,
Richard.

694
00:42:44,342 --> 00:42:46,344
He does grow on you.

695
00:42:46,344 --> 00:42:50,337
Smiley pecker.

696
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:56,343
They act like he hung the moon.

697
00:43:05,363 --> 00:43:09,356
Honey?

698
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:16,374
You asleep?

699
00:43:16,374 --> 00:43:20,367
Good morning, Kellie.

700
00:43:21,379 --> 00:43:23,381
Motels was all full.

701
00:43:23,381 --> 00:43:27,374
Lane said it'd be OK
to bunk in with y'all.

702
00:43:28,386 --> 00:43:31,389
Well, how'd you sleep, Tuff?

703
00:43:31,389 --> 00:43:32,390
Like an angel.

704
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:36,394
Me, too.

705
00:43:36,394 --> 00:43:39,397
Morning, Kellie.

706
00:43:39,397 --> 00:43:41,399
How you doing?

707
00:43:41,399 --> 00:43:43,401
Great.

708
00:43:43,401 --> 00:43:46,404
Just great.

709
00:43:46,404 --> 00:43:48,406
What about getting
our own place?

710
00:43:48,406 --> 00:43:51,409
I think it's a good idea
if you got the money.

711
00:43:51,409 --> 00:43:54,412
My daddy will lend us the money.

712
00:43:54,412 --> 00:43:58,416
His friend in real estate
can get us a good deal.

713
00:43:58,416 --> 00:44:01,419
How's it going to be ours
if he buys it?

714
00:44:01,419 --> 00:44:04,422
You want a place?
I'll get you a place.

715
00:44:04,422 --> 00:44:08,415
I want to live near my folks,
since you'll be gone so much.

716
00:44:09,427 --> 00:44:10,428
Whatever you want.

717
00:44:10,428 --> 00:44:14,421
OK. Drive careful.

718
00:44:28,446 --> 00:44:30,448
What's that?

719
00:44:30,448 --> 00:44:31,449
That's exactly what you wanted...

720
00:44:31,449 --> 00:44:35,442
a place close to your parents.

721
00:44:37,455 --> 00:44:40,458
You are just going to love it.

722
00:44:40,458 --> 00:44:42,460
I bought this
off that singer Ray Raymond.

723
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,462
You paid money for this?

724
00:44:44,462 --> 00:44:47,465
I got him down
to almost nothing.

725
00:44:47,465 --> 00:44:49,467
It's only $600.
Can you believe that?

726
00:44:49,467 --> 00:44:52,470
Lane, it's the ugliest thing
I've ever seen.

727
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:53,471
Got great ventilation.

728
00:44:53,471 --> 00:44:57,475
We can keep the TV
and all them eight-tracks.

729
00:44:57,475 --> 00:45:01,479
Right here, Elvis Presley
once had a beer in our kitchen.

730
00:45:01,479 --> 00:45:03,481
Lately?

731
00:45:03,481 --> 00:45:05,483
No, I think
it was sometime back...

732
00:45:05,483 --> 00:45:06,484
but it's real homey.

733
00:45:06,484 --> 00:45:09,487
Here is the bath suite, complete
with shower and curtain.

734
00:45:09,487 --> 00:45:11,489
That was generous.

735
00:45:11,489 --> 00:45:13,491
Lane, I can't live here.

736
00:45:13,491 --> 00:45:15,493
It'll give me nightmares.

737
00:45:15,493 --> 00:45:17,495
Now, honey, a couple days...

738
00:45:17,495 --> 00:45:20,498
you'll be calling it
home sweet home.

739
00:45:20,498 --> 00:45:21,499
I don't think so.

740
00:45:21,499 --> 00:45:25,492
Look. Double closets.

741
00:45:33,511 --> 00:45:35,513
Let's just put it
in the back, honey.

742
00:45:35,513 --> 00:45:37,515
Let's put it up front,
then the ice cream don't melt.

743
00:45:37,515 --> 00:45:40,518
Let's just put
the ice cream up there.

744
00:45:40,518 --> 00:45:44,522
This way we know
where it's at when we get home.

745
00:45:44,522 --> 00:45:47,525
We got more room in back.

746
00:45:47,525 --> 00:45:48,526
What's this?

747
00:45:48,526 --> 00:45:50,528
That is for later.

748
00:45:50,528 --> 00:45:51,529
You mean it's for me?

749
00:45:51,529 --> 00:45:55,533
No, I mean it's for later.

750
00:45:55,533 --> 00:45:57,535
It ain't my birthday
or anything.

751
00:45:57,535 --> 00:46:01,528
No. It ain't your birthday.

752
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,542
It's our anniversary, isn't it?

753
00:46:04,542 --> 00:46:06,544
Shoot, honey, I forgot.

754
00:46:06,544 --> 00:46:10,537
Just keep looking in the box.

755
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:14,552
Oh, Kel.

756
00:46:14,552 --> 00:46:15,553
Fifth in the world.

757
00:46:15,553 --> 00:46:18,556
It's time
you started dressing like it.

758
00:46:18,556 --> 00:46:21,559
You always looking out for me,
ain't you?

759
00:46:21,559 --> 00:46:23,561
Somebody's got to.

760
00:46:23,561 --> 00:46:24,562
I love you, honey.

761
00:46:24,562 --> 00:46:28,555
I love you, too.

762
00:46:31,569 --> 00:46:33,571
I got another surprise for you
at home.

763
00:46:33,571 --> 00:46:37,564
It's something for me to wear.

764
00:46:38,576 --> 00:46:40,578
For the next ten days...

765
00:46:40,578 --> 00:46:42,580
each cowboy
will ride one bull a day...

766
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,582
and the winner will be
our World's Champion.

767
00:46:44,582 --> 00:46:48,586
Lane Frost... good bull here
he's got today...

768
00:46:48,586 --> 00:46:49,587
Mission lmpossible.

769
00:46:49,587 --> 00:46:53,580
He's awful hard to handle
in this first round...

770
00:46:56,594 --> 00:47:00,598
Lane Frost wants to be
the World's Champion bull rider.

771
00:47:00,598 --> 00:47:04,591
All he's got to do is beat
eighty-one-point scores.

772
00:47:05,603 --> 00:47:07,605
Eighty-one is what
he's got to beat.

773
00:47:07,605 --> 00:47:09,607
He's there for the whistle.

774
00:47:09,607 --> 00:47:11,609
Let's check the judges.

775
00:47:11,609 --> 00:47:13,611
Eighty-five points!

776
00:47:13,611 --> 00:47:17,604
Eighty-five puts him in first
place for the first round.

777
00:47:20,618 --> 00:47:23,621
After seven days,
Lane Frost is the only cowboy...

778
00:47:23,621 --> 00:47:25,623
to ride all seven head.

779
00:47:25,623 --> 00:47:27,625
This is bull number eight.

780
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:28,626
He's trying to break
a world record...

781
00:47:28,626 --> 00:47:29,627
being the first man
to ride all ten bulls...

782
00:47:29,627 --> 00:47:33,620
at the National Finals.

783
00:47:34,632 --> 00:47:38,625
Lane Frost
is going for a new record.

784
00:47:39,637 --> 00:47:40,638
He did it!

785
00:47:40,638 --> 00:47:44,642
Ladies and gentlemen,
eight in a row... Lane Frost.

786
00:47:44,642 --> 00:47:46,644
On the verge
of a World's Championship...

787
00:47:46,644 --> 00:47:48,646
you've won 83,000 so far
this year...

788
00:47:48,646 --> 00:47:51,649
you're in first place
ahead of fifteen competitors.

789
00:47:51,649 --> 00:47:53,651
This first world's title
will be easy, right?

790
00:47:53,651 --> 00:47:56,654
Well, I don't think
it's ever easy, George.

791
00:47:56,654 --> 00:47:59,657
When you got bull riders
like Cody Lambert...

792
00:47:59,657 --> 00:48:01,659
and Jim Sharp...
Jim's riding good this year...

793
00:48:01,659 --> 00:48:05,663
it's going to be tough,
but I'm tickled to be here.

794
00:48:05,663 --> 00:48:07,665
Me and my traveling partner
Tuff Hedeman...

795
00:48:07,665 --> 00:48:09,667
been trading places all year.

796
00:48:09,667 --> 00:48:11,669
Sometimes he's in first,
next week I'm in first.

797
00:48:11,669 --> 00:48:14,672
If he wins,
I'll be so happy for him...

798
00:48:14,672 --> 00:48:16,674
I'll forget about myself losing.

799
00:48:16,674 --> 00:48:20,678
Lane Frost...
great bull rider, terrible liar.

800
00:48:20,678 --> 00:48:22,680
You're not going
to be happy for him.

801
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,682
Sure I would.
He's luckier than I am.

802
00:48:24,682 --> 00:48:28,686
After nine days, Lane Frost
is still in first place.

803
00:48:28,686 --> 00:48:31,689
If he gets eighty-six points
or higher...

804
00:48:31,689 --> 00:48:33,691
nobody else can catch him
here in the competition.

805
00:48:33,691 --> 00:48:35,693
He's on that bull Misfit.

806
00:48:35,693 --> 00:48:38,696
Many cowboys have had
a tough time with this bull...

807
00:48:38,696 --> 00:48:41,699
but look how easily Lane
seems to be handling it.

808
00:48:41,699 --> 00:48:45,692
I've never seen anyone ride...

809
00:48:46,704 --> 00:48:47,705
Tell me.

810
00:48:47,705 --> 00:48:51,709
He's trying for nine in a row.

811
00:48:51,709 --> 00:48:53,711
He's there
for the eight-second whistle!

812
00:48:53,711 --> 00:48:55,713
We're going
to get Lane's score...

813
00:48:55,713 --> 00:48:58,716
He's hung up,
ladies and gentlemen!

814
00:48:58,716 --> 00:49:02,709
His hand is hung up
in that rope...

815
00:49:08,726 --> 00:49:10,728
He's underneath the bull!

816
00:49:10,728 --> 00:49:13,731
Lane Frost
is underneath the bull!

817
00:49:13,731 --> 00:49:16,734
Our bullfighters get him off,
ladies and gentlemen.

818
00:49:16,734 --> 00:49:17,735
They got him away.

819
00:49:17,735 --> 00:49:20,738
Lane Frost
is free from that bull.

820
00:49:20,738 --> 00:49:23,741
Look at that score
coming up for Lane Frost.

821
00:49:23,741 --> 00:49:27,745
An eighty-seven-point marking!

822
00:49:27,745 --> 00:49:30,748
Your new World's Champion
bull rider...

823
00:49:30,748 --> 00:49:33,751
Lane Frost from Quanah, Texas.

824
00:49:33,751 --> 00:49:37,755
Lane Frost has already
won the World's Championship...

825
00:49:37,755 --> 00:49:38,756
but he's got
one more bull to ride.

826
00:49:38,756 --> 00:49:40,758
If he rides that bull...

827
00:49:40,758 --> 00:49:43,761
he will become
the first man in history...

828
00:49:43,761 --> 00:49:46,764
to ride all ten bulls
at the National Finals rodeo...

829
00:49:46,764 --> 00:49:48,766
but he has drawn Red Rock.

830
00:49:48,766 --> 00:49:52,759
This bull has bucked off
over three hundred cowboys.

831
00:49:53,771 --> 00:49:57,764
This could be a moment
that rodeo will never forget.

832
00:49:58,776 --> 00:50:00,778
That's hard luck...

833
00:50:00,778 --> 00:50:02,780
you drawing Red Rock
on your last bull.

834
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:05,783
I don't care when I draw him.

835
00:50:05,783 --> 00:50:09,787
We've been waiting for this
for a long time, ain't we?

836
00:50:09,787 --> 00:50:11,789
OK, boys. OK!

837
00:50:11,789 --> 00:50:13,791
Lane Frost...
World's Champion bull rider...

838
00:50:13,791 --> 00:50:16,794
on a bull that has never
been ridden... Red Rock.

839
00:50:16,794 --> 00:50:19,797
Look at the strength
this animal has.

840
00:50:19,797 --> 00:50:20,798
Lane is truly showing...

841
00:50:20,798 --> 00:50:23,801
his World's Championship
style of bull riding.

842
00:50:23,801 --> 00:50:27,805
He could be the first cowboy
to ride all ten bulls...

843
00:50:27,805 --> 00:50:28,806
at the National Finals rodeo.

844
00:50:28,806 --> 00:50:31,809
Look at them go! Lane Frost!

845
00:50:31,809 --> 00:50:34,812
He's not there
for the eight-second whistle!

846
00:50:34,812 --> 00:50:36,814
That makes him victim
three hundred and five.

847
00:50:36,814 --> 00:50:40,807
I think Red Rock ought to be
getting this award instead...

848
00:50:41,819 --> 00:50:44,822
but since y'all put
my name on it so nice...

849
00:50:44,822 --> 00:50:48,815
I guess I'll keep it.

850
00:50:51,829 --> 00:50:53,831
This is the biggest dream
of my life.

851
00:50:53,831 --> 00:50:56,834
Heck, it's the biggest dream
of any cowboy's life.

852
00:50:56,834 --> 00:50:59,837
Now that I'm the World Champ...

853
00:50:59,837 --> 00:51:02,840
I'll do my best
for all the fans there.

854
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,843
Well, I just want
to thank everybody...

855
00:51:05,843 --> 00:51:08,846
that stood behind me
on the way up.

856
00:51:08,846 --> 00:51:12,839
Thank you very much.

857
00:51:18,856 --> 00:51:20,858
Today's the day

858
00:51:20,858 --> 00:51:24,851
I'm gonna make it...

859
00:51:25,863 --> 00:51:28,866
Well, these are
so much bigger today.

860
00:51:28,866 --> 00:51:29,867
That's something.

861
00:51:29,867 --> 00:51:32,870
It took a lot of try
to win this, son.

862
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:34,872
It's real nice.

863
00:51:34,872 --> 00:51:38,876
I felt like I was hanging on
by a fingernail a time or two.

864
00:51:38,876 --> 00:51:40,878
No, you rode real good.

865
00:51:40,878 --> 00:51:43,881
Of course, now the job
is staying on top.

866
00:51:43,881 --> 00:51:47,874
That's when we find out
if you're a real champion.

867
00:51:55,893 --> 00:51:56,894
Is anything wrong?

868
00:51:56,894 --> 00:51:58,896
Why?

869
00:51:58,896 --> 00:52:01,899
I never seen you
having more than one beer.

870
00:52:01,899 --> 00:52:02,900
Well, ain't I entitled?

871
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:03,901
Of course.

872
00:52:03,901 --> 00:52:05,903
I'm the World's Champ now.

873
00:52:05,903 --> 00:52:09,896
Don't that count
for something with you?

874
00:52:11,909 --> 00:52:14,912
Congratulations, Lane.
You did a hell of a job.

875
00:52:14,912 --> 00:52:16,914
Thank you very much.
Appreciate that.

876
00:52:16,914 --> 00:52:17,915
Congratulations, Lane.

877
00:52:17,915 --> 00:52:19,917
There he is,
politicking again.

878
00:52:19,917 --> 00:52:23,910
They act like he hung the moon.

879
00:52:25,923 --> 00:52:28,926
Hello, Kellie.
How have you been?

880
00:52:28,926 --> 00:52:31,929
Hello, Martin. How are you?

881
00:52:31,929 --> 00:52:32,930
Good.

882
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:36,934
Hey, congratulations for Lane.

883
00:52:36,934 --> 00:52:40,938
Thank you.
You did real well in the roping.

884
00:52:40,938 --> 00:52:44,931
Yeah. I won another buckle.

885
00:52:56,954 --> 00:52:59,957
If you want to go meet
Tuff and Cody, it's all right.

886
00:52:59,957 --> 00:53:03,950
I just have to get
out of these shoes.

887
00:53:06,964 --> 00:53:10,957
Can you help me with these?

888
00:53:17,975 --> 00:53:19,977
I'll be glad to get home.

889
00:53:19,977 --> 00:53:23,981
Two weeks in Vegas
is too long for me.

890
00:53:23,981 --> 00:53:25,983
Nobody made you come.

891
00:53:25,983 --> 00:53:27,985
I wanted to see you ride.

892
00:53:27,985 --> 00:53:29,987
That's crap.
You hate bull riding.

893
00:53:29,987 --> 00:53:32,990
Calf roping's more your style.

894
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:34,992
That's why you was talking
to Martin Hudson.

895
00:53:34,992 --> 00:53:35,993
You was with him once.

896
00:53:35,993 --> 00:53:38,996
Maybe you ain't got it
out of your system.

897
00:53:38,996 --> 00:53:40,998
That was way before
we got together.

898
00:53:40,998 --> 00:53:43,000
So why was you talking
to him tonight?

899
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,003
I had to talk to somebody.

900
00:53:46,003 --> 00:53:48,005
I don't want that jerk
anywheres near you.

901
00:53:48,005 --> 00:53:51,008
Everybody knows
you done slept with him.

902
00:53:51,008 --> 00:53:55,012
Nobody knows.
Lane, what's wrong?

903
00:53:55,012 --> 00:53:57,014
I'm the World Champion now.

904
00:53:57,014 --> 00:53:59,016
People are looking at me.

905
00:53:59,016 --> 00:54:03,020
I want them thinking
we got a great marriage.

906
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:07,013
I thought we did.

907
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:35,052
Tonight at the National
Finals rodeo...

908
00:54:35,052 --> 00:54:36,053
World Champions were crowned.

909
00:54:36,053 --> 00:54:40,057
Among them, the popular
bull rider Lane Frost...

910
00:54:40,057 --> 00:54:42,059
who won
his first National title.

911
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:45,062
Here's a comment
from Frost's acceptance speech.

912
00:54:45,062 --> 00:54:48,065
This is the biggest dream
of my life.

913
00:54:48,065 --> 00:54:52,069
Heck, it's the biggest dream
of any cowboy's life.

914
00:54:52,069 --> 00:54:54,071
Now that I'm the World Champ...

915
00:54:54,071 --> 00:54:58,075
I'll do my best
for all the fans there.

916
00:54:58,075 --> 00:55:00,077
I just want
to thank everybody...

917
00:55:00,077 --> 00:55:02,079
who stood behind me
on the way up.

918
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:06,072
Thank you very much.

919
00:55:16,093 --> 00:55:18,095
I'm sorry, Kel.

920
00:55:18,095 --> 00:55:20,097
I didn't mean
to take it out on you.

921
00:55:20,097 --> 00:55:22,099
I got all these people
looking at me...

922
00:55:22,099 --> 00:55:23,100
and expecting so much.

923
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:26,103
Don't want to let them down.

924
00:55:26,103 --> 00:55:27,104
You won't, Lane.

925
00:55:27,104 --> 00:55:30,107
But you got to help me.

926
00:55:30,107 --> 00:55:34,100
I will, honey.

927
00:55:36,113 --> 00:55:40,106
I don't know why you put up
with me half the time.

928
00:55:45,122 --> 00:55:47,124
Real proud of you, Lane.

929
00:55:47,124 --> 00:55:48,125
You, too, Kellie.

930
00:55:48,125 --> 00:55:50,127
How about it, everybody?

931
00:55:50,127 --> 00:55:52,129
Lane Frost,
World Champion bull rider...

932
00:55:52,129 --> 00:55:55,132
here at Northstar Dodge.

933
00:55:55,132 --> 00:55:58,135
Lane, Kellie meeting us
to promote that hat deal?

934
00:55:58,135 --> 00:56:00,137
No. She's staying with her mom.

935
00:56:00,137 --> 00:56:01,138
Got my Lane Frost underwear.

936
00:56:01,138 --> 00:56:02,139
Got my Lane Frost lunchbox.

937
00:56:02,139 --> 00:56:05,142
They coming out with boots
with your name?

938
00:56:05,142 --> 00:56:09,135
They're calling them
Puss 'n' Boots.

939
00:56:30,167 --> 00:56:31,168
I'll be heading out now.

940
00:56:31,168 --> 00:56:35,172
There's plenty of my shirts
and hats left to buy.

941
00:56:35,172 --> 00:56:37,174
I do appreciate you stopping by.

942
00:56:37,174 --> 00:56:39,176
Come on, Lane.
It's still early.

943
00:56:39,176 --> 00:56:41,178
We ain't even had a dance yet.

944
00:56:41,178 --> 00:56:44,181
Pretty boys
need their sleep, too.

945
00:56:44,181 --> 00:56:48,174
Come on, Lane.
Just one more picture.

946
00:56:57,194 --> 00:56:58,195
Hey, darling...

947
00:56:58,195 --> 00:57:00,197
Sorry I had to leave you
this message...

948
00:57:00,197 --> 00:57:03,200
but I waited as long as I could.

949
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,203
Mom and me
had to get started for Tulsa.

950
00:57:06,203 --> 00:57:09,206
I wish I could have talked
to you, honey.

951
00:57:09,206 --> 00:57:11,208
I love you. Bye.

952
00:57:11,208 --> 00:57:15,212
Shoot, I thought you was there.

953
00:57:15,212 --> 00:57:17,214
I wish you was there.

954
00:57:17,214 --> 00:57:19,216
I just got back.

955
00:57:19,216 --> 00:57:23,220
I had one of them promotional
deals after the rodeo...

956
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:26,223
and they just wouldn't
let me go.

957
00:57:26,223 --> 00:57:27,224
All that stuff.

958
00:57:27,224 --> 00:57:31,228
Well, we're gonna go
to a few more rodeos...

959
00:57:31,228 --> 00:57:35,232
so I guess I won't be home
till Friday night.

960
00:57:35,232 --> 00:57:38,235
If you get this,
leave me a number.

961
00:57:38,235 --> 00:57:42,239
I'll call you there in Tulsa
in the morning.

962
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:44,241
Wish you was home.

963
00:57:44,241 --> 00:57:46,243
If not, I'll...

964
00:57:46,243 --> 00:57:49,246
Well, you know, I'll call you
tomorrow night, OK?

965
00:57:49,246 --> 00:57:52,249
Good luck with your horse
and everything.

966
00:57:52,249 --> 00:57:56,253
I love you.

967
00:57:56,253 --> 00:58:00,246
Good night.

968
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:35,292
I thought you might want
a nightcap.

969
00:58:35,292 --> 00:58:38,295
We don't even have to go out.

970
00:58:38,295 --> 00:58:40,297
You know, I don't drink much.

971
00:58:40,297 --> 00:58:41,298
Yeah, OK.

972
00:58:41,298 --> 00:58:45,302
Well, then, maybe
you can sign this for my nephew.

973
00:58:45,302 --> 00:58:48,305
He's a real fan of yours.

974
00:58:48,305 --> 00:58:52,298
OK, sure.

975
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:54,311
It's not usually so cold
in Prescott...

976
00:58:54,311 --> 00:58:58,304
this time of year.

977
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:04,321
All right...

978
00:59:04,321 --> 00:59:08,314
come on in a sec.

979
00:59:16,333 --> 00:59:18,335
You don't think anything's
happened to him, do you?

980
00:59:18,335 --> 00:59:22,339
I think one of them buckle
bunnies from last night...

981
00:59:22,339 --> 00:59:25,342
was looking to happen to him
in a big way.

982
00:59:25,342 --> 00:59:27,344
Listen to this one.

983
00:59:27,344 --> 00:59:29,346
It's called "Waitin' On Lane."

984
00:59:29,346 --> 00:59:32,349
"We've been waitin' on Lane
ever since we recall.

985
00:59:32,349 --> 00:59:35,352
"We started in April,
and it's comin' on Fall.

986
00:59:35,352 --> 00:59:38,355
"We have us a bite,
we have us a chew...

987
00:59:38,355 --> 00:59:40,357
"we get us some shuteye,
we have us a brew.

988
00:59:40,357 --> 00:59:43,360
"Someone's takin' his picture,
someone's wanting a loan.

989
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:47,364
"He's kissin' the babies,
or he's on the damn phone.

990
00:59:47,364 --> 00:59:50,367
"But we'll keep on waitin',
though we ain't pleased...

991
00:59:50,367 --> 00:59:53,370
"'cause the World Champion
bull rider's got the van keys."

992
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:55,372
You're damn right.
I like that one.

993
00:59:55,372 --> 00:59:58,375
I hope he didn't get
any of them crotch critters.

994
00:59:58,375 --> 00:59:59,376
How's your dog, Nelson?

995
00:59:59,376 --> 01:00:01,378
It ain't like that.

996
01:00:01,378 --> 01:00:04,381
I run into an uncle of mine.

997
01:00:04,381 --> 01:00:06,383
Got a place outside of town.

998
01:00:06,383 --> 01:00:10,387
It got too late.
He couldn't drive me back.

999
01:00:10,387 --> 01:00:14,391
Wish I had me
an uncle like that...

1000
01:00:14,391 --> 01:00:17,394
put me up whenever
I come to town, feed me...

1001
01:00:17,394 --> 01:00:19,396
then plant one of them...

1002
01:00:19,396 --> 01:00:23,389
big ol' greasy hickeys
on my neck.

1003
01:00:25,402 --> 01:00:29,395
Get in the van.

1004
01:00:32,409 --> 01:00:35,412
And then you drove
from Scottsdale to Prescott.

1005
01:00:35,412 --> 01:00:39,416
What happened there?

1006
01:00:39,416 --> 01:00:41,418
Tuff and Cody got checked,
and I fell off.

1007
01:00:41,418 --> 01:00:45,411
Then you drove to Laramie?

1008
01:00:52,429 --> 01:00:55,432
We stayed there...

1009
01:00:55,432 --> 01:00:59,425
drove back the next day.

1010
01:01:11,448 --> 01:01:14,451
I missed you.

1011
01:01:14,451 --> 01:01:17,454
I'm a little sore.

1012
01:01:17,454 --> 01:01:20,457
- Sorry.
- You're hurt?

1013
01:01:20,457 --> 01:01:24,450
It's just the usual.

1014
01:01:26,463 --> 01:01:28,465
I'm glad you're home.

1015
01:01:28,465 --> 01:01:32,458
I just wish
it was gonna be longer.

1016
01:01:39,476 --> 01:01:43,469
That night in Prescott...

1017
01:01:44,481 --> 01:01:48,474
What?

1018
01:01:56,493 --> 01:01:57,494
Too stupid to tell you.

1019
01:01:57,494 --> 01:01:59,496
It's just something Tuff did.

1020
01:01:59,496 --> 01:02:03,489
I'll tell you
when I don't hurt so much.

1021
01:02:05,502 --> 01:02:09,506
Night.

1022
01:02:09,506 --> 01:02:13,499
Good night.

1023
01:02:22,519 --> 01:02:25,522
I want to thank you folks
for coming here today...

1024
01:02:25,522 --> 01:02:26,523
on such short notice.

1025
01:02:26,523 --> 01:02:29,526
Red Rock and I and Lane
have an important announcement.

1026
01:02:29,526 --> 01:02:31,528
Lane's going
to try the impossible...

1027
01:02:31,528 --> 01:02:34,531
to ride the unrideable bull
Red Rock.

1028
01:02:34,531 --> 01:02:36,533
Red Rock hasn't been ridden
in 309 tries...

1029
01:02:36,533 --> 01:02:39,536
by the world's toughest
bull riders, including Lane.

1030
01:02:39,536 --> 01:02:41,538
Lane will get three chances.

1031
01:02:41,538 --> 01:02:44,541
The first one, April 17th,
right here in Seguin, Texas.

1032
01:02:44,541 --> 01:02:48,545
If Lane succeeds, he'll write
his own page in rodeo history.

1033
01:02:48,545 --> 01:02:50,547
I'm sure you folks
have questions.

1034
01:02:50,547 --> 01:02:52,549
We'll be glad to answer them.

1035
01:02:52,549 --> 01:02:53,550
Get something now, champ.

1036
01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:55,552
No, thanks.
Appreciate it, though.

1037
01:02:55,552 --> 01:02:58,555
I watched you ride
since I was a kid.

1038
01:02:58,555 --> 01:02:59,556
I wanted to give you
something back.

1039
01:02:59,556 --> 01:03:03,560
I got a spot for this.
Thank you.

1040
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:05,562
Lane, why didn't you
tell me about this?

1041
01:03:05,562 --> 01:03:08,565
You said we were coming
for a shirt promotion.

1042
01:03:08,565 --> 01:03:11,568
I just wanted it
to be a surprise.

1043
01:03:11,568 --> 01:03:12,569
We're partners, Lane.

1044
01:03:12,569 --> 01:03:15,572
What do you think
I'm doing this for?

1045
01:03:15,572 --> 01:03:17,574
We got money, Lane.

1046
01:03:17,574 --> 01:03:20,577
The boy there,
he used to be World Champion.

1047
01:03:20,577 --> 01:03:22,579
Now he's got his hand out.

1048
01:03:22,579 --> 01:03:24,581
I don't want that for us.

1049
01:03:24,581 --> 01:03:25,582
You'll never be like that.

1050
01:03:25,582 --> 01:03:27,584
I know.
Red Rock's my guarantee.

1051
01:03:27,584 --> 01:03:29,586
Your guarantee is us.

1052
01:03:29,586 --> 01:03:31,588
Of course it is.

1053
01:03:31,588 --> 01:03:33,590
What do you think
I'm doing this for?

1054
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:36,593
'Cause you like
all the attention.

1055
01:03:36,593 --> 01:03:38,595
So you don't have
to be alone with me.

1056
01:03:38,595 --> 01:03:41,598
This is the most important day
of my life.

1057
01:03:41,598 --> 01:03:44,601
I got to go talk to them.
You coming?

1058
01:03:44,601 --> 01:03:48,594
Not hardly.

1059
01:03:52,609 --> 01:03:56,613
We've wanted to add on,
but we never had enough money.

1060
01:03:56,613 --> 01:03:57,614
It's going to be great.

1061
01:03:57,614 --> 01:04:01,607
The corral he's building for us
is going to be right up there.

1062
01:04:02,619 --> 01:04:05,622
Lane's been so good to us.

1063
01:04:05,622 --> 01:04:07,624
I don't know
where he gets his energy.

1064
01:04:07,624 --> 01:04:09,626
I've never seen him relax.

1065
01:04:09,626 --> 01:04:11,628
We didn't even have a honeymoon.

1066
01:04:11,628 --> 01:04:12,629
We did.

1067
01:04:12,629 --> 01:04:15,632
Clyde didn't talk to me
for the first three days.

1068
01:04:15,632 --> 01:04:17,634
On your honeymoon?

1069
01:04:17,634 --> 01:04:19,636
Finally I went to him, said...

1070
01:04:19,636 --> 01:04:22,639
"Clyde, what is wrong?
What have I done?"

1071
01:04:22,639 --> 01:04:23,640
You know what he said?

1072
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,642
"They ruined my boots."

1073
01:04:25,642 --> 01:04:26,643
His boots?

1074
01:04:26,643 --> 01:04:28,645
Yeah. On his wedding day...

1075
01:04:28,645 --> 01:04:32,649
some of his friends threw him
into the water trough.

1076
01:04:32,649 --> 01:04:36,653
It was just a joke,
but he worried and brooded.

1077
01:04:36,653 --> 01:04:38,655
It's funny now.

1078
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:42,648
I see a lot of Clyde in Lane,
but he's a good man.

1079
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:45,662
I couldn't have asked
for better.

1080
01:04:45,662 --> 01:04:48,665
Tuff, why didn't you tell me
we was driving?

1081
01:04:48,665 --> 01:04:50,667
Told Kellie
we'd fly out tomorrow.

1082
01:04:50,667 --> 01:04:52,669
Tomorrow flight's all full.
Sorry, Kel.

1083
01:04:52,669 --> 01:04:54,671
Lane, it's all right.

1084
01:04:54,671 --> 01:04:56,673
It ain't.
She drove all the way here.

1085
01:04:56,673 --> 01:04:58,675
I got to see you ride.

1086
01:04:58,675 --> 01:05:00,677
You need
some clean clothes anyway.

1087
01:05:00,677 --> 01:05:01,678
Give me your dirty things.

1088
01:05:01,678 --> 01:05:05,682
If Spanish Fork wasn't
big money, I'd stay with you.

1089
01:05:05,682 --> 01:05:06,683
Don't worry about it.

1090
01:05:06,683 --> 01:05:09,686
At least I got to see you.

1091
01:05:09,686 --> 01:05:13,679
- I'll call you.
- I love you.

1092
01:05:25,702 --> 01:05:29,706
I just drove up to see Lane.

1093
01:05:29,706 --> 01:05:33,710
Figure a World Champion could
get somebody to do his laundry.

1094
01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:35,712
I don't mind.
That way it's done right.

1095
01:05:35,712 --> 01:05:38,715
You want to get some dinner?

1096
01:05:38,715 --> 01:05:40,717
Thanks, but I should go.

1097
01:05:40,717 --> 01:05:42,719
I got things to do.

1098
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:45,722
Lane's gone so much,
it's hard to keep up.

1099
01:05:45,722 --> 01:05:48,725
I'll get back by eleven.
Good to see you.

1100
01:05:48,725 --> 01:05:52,718
It's good seeing you,
too, Kellie.

1101
01:05:56,733 --> 01:06:00,726
Can I change my mind?

1102
01:06:01,738 --> 01:06:04,741
He gets up at six every morning
and jump ropes or runs...

1103
01:06:04,741 --> 01:06:05,742
then works in the barn.

1104
01:06:05,742 --> 01:06:08,745
At night he watches his tapes
to improve.

1105
01:06:08,745 --> 01:06:11,748
That's on his day off.

1106
01:06:11,748 --> 01:06:14,751
You've changed so much.

1107
01:06:14,751 --> 01:06:16,753
Changed? How?

1108
01:06:16,753 --> 01:06:20,757
I remember the first time
I ever saw you ride.

1109
01:06:20,757 --> 01:06:24,761
It was up to Ardmore
about five years ago...

1110
01:06:24,761 --> 01:06:27,764
right before
we started going out.

1111
01:06:27,764 --> 01:06:30,767
I could see how much
you loved it...

1112
01:06:30,767 --> 01:06:33,770
how much pride
you had in racing...

1113
01:06:33,770 --> 01:06:36,773
in beating your own time.

1114
01:06:36,773 --> 01:06:37,774
I've been riding
my whole life...

1115
01:06:37,774 --> 01:06:41,778
and I remember
I was envious of the way...

1116
01:06:41,778 --> 01:06:43,780
that you handled that horse.

1117
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:47,773
His name was Crawford,
wasn't it?

1118
01:06:49,786 --> 01:06:52,789
He's hurt, but I'm training
another horse.

1119
01:06:52,789 --> 01:06:53,790
Nothing's different.

1120
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:55,792
It is different.

1121
01:06:55,792 --> 01:06:59,785
You're living for Lane.
It's all about Lane now.

1122
01:07:01,798 --> 01:07:03,800
I want to help him.

1123
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:07,804
Even drive 400 miles
to pick up his dirty laundry?

1124
01:07:07,804 --> 01:07:11,797
If that's what he wants.

1125
01:07:12,809 --> 01:07:16,802
Would he do
the same thing for you?

1126
01:07:17,814 --> 01:07:20,817
Yes, he would.

1127
01:07:20,817 --> 01:07:23,820
It's not about him or me.

1128
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:26,823
It's him and me.

1129
01:07:26,823 --> 01:07:29,826
We're in this together.

1130
01:07:29,826 --> 01:07:33,830
I don't see anybody asking you
for your autograph.

1131
01:07:33,830 --> 01:07:35,832
I don't need that.

1132
01:07:35,832 --> 01:07:39,836
Or giving you gold belt buckles.

1133
01:07:39,836 --> 01:07:43,829
He deserves it, Martin.
He's better than me.

1134
01:07:44,841 --> 01:07:48,834
That's where you're wrong.

1135
01:07:50,847 --> 01:07:54,840
We should get the check.

1136
01:07:58,855 --> 01:08:02,848
You're still beautiful.

1137
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:07,853
That hasn't changed.

1138
01:08:17,874 --> 01:08:18,875
Hello, darling.

1139
01:08:18,875 --> 01:08:22,868
Hi, Lane.
I'm so glad you're home.

1140
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:27,873
I'll get it.
It's probably for me.

1141
01:08:30,887 --> 01:08:34,891
Oh, hey, Tuff.

1142
01:08:34,891 --> 01:08:36,893
I don't think I can make that.

1143
01:08:36,893 --> 01:08:40,886
I got that Red Rock deal
in Seguin on the seventeenth.

1144
01:08:42,899 --> 01:08:45,902
I don't know.
I'm not crazy about them.

1145
01:08:45,902 --> 01:08:49,895
Well, 'cause they crash
all the time, that's why.

1146
01:08:50,907 --> 01:08:53,910
All right. Check it out.

1147
01:08:53,910 --> 01:08:57,903
All right. Yep.

1148
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:07,913
Thanks.

1149
01:09:10,927 --> 01:09:13,930
Lane, there's something
I have to tell you.

1150
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:14,931
Tuff wants to buy
a little plane.

1151
01:09:14,931 --> 01:09:17,934
Says it will cut down
on the driving around.

1152
01:09:17,934 --> 01:09:20,937
Something happened.
I didn't want it to...

1153
01:09:20,937 --> 01:09:24,930
but it just did.

1154
01:09:25,942 --> 01:09:27,944
Lane, are you listening?

1155
01:09:27,944 --> 01:09:31,937
Yeah. Just a second.

1156
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:37,943
Lane, listen to me.

1157
01:09:38,955 --> 01:09:42,948
I'm listening.

1158
01:09:45,962 --> 01:09:49,955
I've been seeing somebody else.

1159
01:09:51,968 --> 01:09:54,971
I mean, I saw somebody else.

1160
01:09:54,971 --> 01:09:56,973
It was just once.

1161
01:09:56,973 --> 01:10:00,977
It's never
going to happen again.

1162
01:10:00,977 --> 01:10:04,970
Who was it?

1163
01:10:06,983 --> 01:10:10,976
I can't explain it, Lane.

1164
01:10:11,988 --> 01:10:13,990
I know it was wrong.

1165
01:10:13,990 --> 01:10:17,983
Who was it?

1166
01:10:18,995 --> 01:10:22,988
Martin Hudson.

1167
01:10:27,003 --> 01:10:29,005
How many other guys
you been with, Kel?

1168
01:10:29,005 --> 01:10:30,006
None.

1169
01:10:30,006 --> 01:10:32,008
I'm supposed to believe that?

1170
01:10:32,008 --> 01:10:34,010
How do I know what
you're doing here...

1171
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:36,012
when I'm on the road?

1172
01:10:36,012 --> 01:10:39,015
I've been here, Lane.

1173
01:10:39,015 --> 01:10:40,016
Every time I called you...

1174
01:10:40,016 --> 01:10:43,019
all I got was
that damn answering machine.

1175
01:10:43,019 --> 01:10:46,022
- I'm always here, Lane.
- What did I tell you?

1176
01:10:46,022 --> 01:10:48,024
I told you
to stay away from him!

1177
01:10:48,024 --> 01:10:52,017
I know.

1178
01:10:53,029 --> 01:10:55,031
Probably gone and told
all his pussy roping friends.

1179
01:10:55,031 --> 01:10:56,032
He wouldn't do that.

1180
01:10:56,032 --> 01:10:58,034
Yes, he would, Kel!

1181
01:10:58,034 --> 01:11:00,036
We promised
we'd take care of each other.

1182
01:11:00,036 --> 01:11:03,039
We said we'd do the best
we could by each other.

1183
01:11:03,039 --> 01:11:07,032
Doesn't that mean
anything to you?

1184
01:11:08,044 --> 01:11:11,047
So why'd you do it?

1185
01:11:11,047 --> 01:11:13,049
I wanted you,
but you weren't there.

1186
01:11:13,049 --> 01:11:15,051
I've been out there
busting my ass...

1187
01:11:15,051 --> 01:11:17,053
trying to give you
everything you want.

1188
01:11:17,053 --> 01:11:19,055
We live in a trailer.

1189
01:11:19,055 --> 01:11:22,058
You remodeled your dad's place.
Even built him corrals.

1190
01:11:22,058 --> 01:11:26,051
You can't buy his love.

1191
01:11:31,067 --> 01:11:33,069
You get out.

1192
01:11:33,069 --> 01:11:34,070
Lane, I'm sorry.

1193
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:37,073
Get out.
I thought I could trust you!

1194
01:11:37,073 --> 01:11:38,074
Don't let this ruin everything.

1195
01:11:38,074 --> 01:11:40,076
Get out!

1196
01:11:40,076 --> 01:11:44,069
Lane, I love you.

1197
01:11:48,084 --> 01:11:51,087
Lane, is Kellie going
to see you ride Red Rock?

1198
01:11:51,087 --> 01:11:52,088
I'm not sure.

1199
01:11:52,088 --> 01:11:56,081
- She riding next week?
- Maybe.

1200
01:11:57,093 --> 01:11:59,095
Oh, boy, look at this,
ladies and gentlemen.

1201
01:11:59,095 --> 01:12:02,098
Check out the power
and strength of Red Rock.

1202
01:12:02,098 --> 01:12:04,100
He's turning back
into Lane's hand.

1203
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:06,102
Look at this
World Champion bull ride.

1204
01:12:06,102 --> 01:12:08,104
Gosh, he's off.

1205
01:12:08,104 --> 01:12:11,107
He wasn't there
for the eight-second whistle.

1206
01:12:11,107 --> 01:12:13,109
A no-score.

1207
01:12:13,109 --> 01:12:15,111
Red Rock wins again.

1208
01:12:15,111 --> 01:12:18,114
Now, folks,
that makes 310 cowboys...

1209
01:12:18,114 --> 01:12:20,116
that have tried
to ride Red Rock.

1210
01:12:20,116 --> 01:12:22,118
Even the World's Champion
couldn't do that.

1211
01:12:22,118 --> 01:12:25,121
I remind you,
he has two more chances...

1212
01:12:25,121 --> 01:12:29,114
to try and ride
that bull Red Rock.

1213
01:12:30,126 --> 01:12:32,128
Ladies and gentlemen...

1214
01:12:32,128 --> 01:12:34,130
something must be wrong
with Lane Frost.

1215
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:37,133
I've known this great cowboy
for better than five years.

1216
01:12:37,133 --> 01:12:39,135
I've never, ever seen him
get bucked off...

1217
01:12:39,135 --> 01:12:43,128
with a bull
that turned back into his hand.

1218
01:12:47,143 --> 01:12:49,145
What happened to you and Kellie?

1219
01:12:49,145 --> 01:12:51,147
Nothing.
You seen my boots?

1220
01:12:51,147 --> 01:12:55,151
Why did you move home instead
of living with your wife?

1221
01:12:55,151 --> 01:12:59,155
Dad needs a little help
right now.

1222
01:12:59,155 --> 01:13:03,159
Who are all those girls
calling at all hours?

1223
01:13:03,159 --> 01:13:04,160
Probably just fans.

1224
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:06,162
Maybe we ought to get
an unlisted number.

1225
01:13:06,162 --> 01:13:10,166
Look at me and tell me
you're not seeing other girls.

1226
01:13:10,166 --> 01:13:12,168
Can't find nothing
in this house.

1227
01:13:12,168 --> 01:13:14,170
Why won't you look at me?

1228
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:15,171
I'm looking at you.

1229
01:13:15,171 --> 01:13:18,174
You've been cheating on Kellie,
haven't you?

1230
01:13:18,174 --> 01:13:22,178
- Where's my spurs?
- On the table. Answer me.

1231
01:13:22,178 --> 01:13:25,181
I haven't done anything
she hasn't done, OK?

1232
01:13:25,181 --> 01:13:27,183
I can't let you throw away...

1233
01:13:27,183 --> 01:13:30,186
the best thing that has
ever happened to you!

1234
01:13:30,186 --> 01:13:31,187
What do you want?

1235
01:13:31,187 --> 01:13:33,189
I want the truth.

1236
01:13:33,189 --> 01:13:35,191
Other girls
didn't expect nothing from me.

1237
01:13:35,191 --> 01:13:37,193
That's what I need.

1238
01:13:37,193 --> 01:13:39,195
You don't know what you need.

1239
01:13:39,195 --> 01:13:41,197
She told me
she'd been with another man.

1240
01:13:41,197 --> 01:13:44,200
What do I say to that?

1241
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:46,202
You'll just have to forgive her.

1242
01:13:46,202 --> 01:13:49,205
How come I always have
to be perfect?

1243
01:13:49,205 --> 01:13:51,207
Nobody is asking you
to be perfect.

1244
01:13:51,207 --> 01:13:54,210
Dad does!

1245
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:57,213
I could win the world
a hundred times over.

1246
01:13:57,213 --> 01:13:59,215
It wouldn't matter to him.

1247
01:13:59,215 --> 01:14:02,218
It matters more to him
than anything in this world.

1248
01:14:02,218 --> 01:14:05,221
Then why can't he say something?

1249
01:14:05,221 --> 01:14:09,214
You know I'd give it all back...

1250
01:14:10,226 --> 01:14:13,229
if one time, he could say...

1251
01:14:13,229 --> 01:14:17,222
say...

1252
01:14:18,234 --> 01:14:22,227
It's killing me.

1253
01:14:30,246 --> 01:14:33,249
I want you to look at
these awards of your father's.

1254
01:14:33,249 --> 01:14:37,253
I want you to tell me
what do you see here?

1255
01:14:37,253 --> 01:14:40,256
I don't know.

1256
01:14:40,256 --> 01:14:41,257
Dust.

1257
01:14:41,257 --> 01:14:44,260
They get tarnished.

1258
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:48,264
Sure, we're proud of them,
but 1963, '64...

1259
01:14:48,264 --> 01:14:52,257
that was a long time ago.

1260
01:14:54,270 --> 01:14:57,273
Hold on to the things that last.

1261
01:14:57,273 --> 01:15:01,277
Kellie loves you,
and I know that you love her.

1262
01:15:01,277 --> 01:15:03,279
She won't take me back.

1263
01:15:03,279 --> 01:15:07,272
Why don't you let her decide?

1264
01:15:16,292 --> 01:15:18,294
You still seeing that guy?

1265
01:15:18,294 --> 01:15:22,287
- I'm going to hang up now.
- Please.

1266
01:15:25,301 --> 01:15:28,304
Lane, I can't be treated
the way you treat me any longer.

1267
01:15:28,304 --> 01:15:31,307
I don't mind taking care
of things for you...

1268
01:15:31,307 --> 01:15:35,311
the bills, your clothes,
having your friends stay over.

1269
01:15:35,311 --> 01:15:37,313
I want to help you...

1270
01:15:37,313 --> 01:15:41,317
but I won't give up everything
and get nothing back.

1271
01:15:41,317 --> 01:15:45,310
It's not enough for me anymore.

1272
01:15:49,325 --> 01:15:53,318
- Bye, Lane.
- I miss you.

1273
01:15:58,334 --> 01:16:02,338
Round two...
Lane Frost versus Red Rock.

1274
01:16:02,338 --> 01:16:05,341
Lane Frost got his hand
hung up in that rope.

1275
01:16:05,341 --> 01:16:06,342
The bullfighters coming in...

1276
01:16:06,342 --> 01:16:09,345
trying to get that rope
out of Lane's hand.

1277
01:16:09,345 --> 01:16:11,347
He's hung up.

1278
01:16:11,347 --> 01:16:13,349
Fifteen hundred pounds,
bucking hard.

1279
01:16:13,349 --> 01:16:16,352
Red Rock is tossing him.

1280
01:16:16,352 --> 01:16:19,355
The bullfighters having
a tremendous, difficult job...

1281
01:16:19,355 --> 01:16:22,358
trying to get his hand
out of there.

1282
01:16:22,358 --> 01:16:23,359
The other bull riders...

1283
01:16:23,359 --> 01:16:26,362
are trying to get him
away from that bull!

1284
01:16:26,362 --> 01:16:29,365
He's taking a pounding,
ladies and gentlemen...

1285
01:16:29,365 --> 01:16:31,367
but he's the World Champion.
He can handle it.

1286
01:16:31,367 --> 01:16:34,370
I can see he is conscious.

1287
01:16:34,370 --> 01:16:37,373
He is conscious.
He is taking some air.

1288
01:16:37,373 --> 01:16:38,374
He's getting his first aid...

1289
01:16:38,374 --> 01:16:42,367
You got to breathe.

1290
01:16:43,379 --> 01:16:47,383
Get a doctor!

1291
01:16:47,383 --> 01:16:50,386
It's Tuff. Listen to me, now.

1292
01:16:50,386 --> 01:16:54,379
Just breathe. Just breathe.

1293
01:16:57,393 --> 01:16:59,395
Shoot, Dad,
it ain't just Red Rock.

1294
01:16:59,395 --> 01:17:02,398
I been having
a heck of a time lately.

1295
01:17:02,398 --> 01:17:04,400
Tore my shoulder out.

1296
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:07,403
Pulled the hell out of my groin.

1297
01:17:07,403 --> 01:17:11,407
I ain't even in the top fifteen.

1298
01:17:11,407 --> 01:17:15,411
I went through
a lot of dry spells.

1299
01:17:15,411 --> 01:17:19,415
Got a tape of me and Red Rock
up at the house.

1300
01:17:19,415 --> 01:17:23,408
Thought maybe you'd look at it,
tell me what I'm doing wrong.

1301
01:17:31,427 --> 01:17:33,429
There ain't nothing
I can tell you...

1302
01:17:33,429 --> 01:17:37,422
about bull riding
you don't know.

1303
01:17:40,436 --> 01:17:43,439
I was...

1304
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:47,443
hard on you at first 'cause...

1305
01:17:47,443 --> 01:17:51,436
I knew you had it in you
to be the best, and...

1306
01:17:53,449 --> 01:17:55,451
Well...

1307
01:17:55,451 --> 01:17:58,454
I guess I just...

1308
01:17:58,454 --> 01:18:02,447
hate seeing anything good
go to waste.

1309
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:07,463
You never ride again...

1310
01:18:07,463 --> 01:18:11,467
it won't matter to me.

1311
01:18:11,467 --> 01:18:15,460
You proved yourself.

1312
01:18:18,474 --> 01:18:21,477
I don't say
what I feel very much...

1313
01:18:21,477 --> 01:18:25,470
but I hope you know that...

1314
01:18:28,484 --> 01:18:32,477
Let's go up to the house,
look at that tape.

1315
01:18:33,489 --> 01:18:37,482
I can probably
find something to pick on.

1316
01:18:45,501 --> 01:18:46,502
How's the neck?

1317
01:18:46,502 --> 01:18:49,505
It's holding my head on.

1318
01:18:49,505 --> 01:18:53,509
You ever think
you're gonna get Red Rock rode?

1319
01:18:53,509 --> 01:18:54,510
What's the point?

1320
01:18:54,510 --> 01:18:56,512
Point?

1321
01:18:56,512 --> 01:18:58,514
Kellie ain't there,
I don't see much point.

1322
01:18:58,514 --> 01:19:02,507
You're starting to sound
like a damn country song.

1323
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:06,522
So what would you do?

1324
01:19:06,522 --> 01:19:10,526
I'd stop wasting my time.
She said it was over.

1325
01:19:10,526 --> 01:19:14,530
I've never known Kellie to lie.
You blew it, Lane.

1326
01:19:14,530 --> 01:19:16,532
Might as well lick your wounds
and learn to live with it...

1327
01:19:16,532 --> 01:19:20,525
'cause the prettiest thing
you'll be waking up to is me.

1328
01:19:43,559 --> 01:19:47,552
Cowboy up.

1329
01:19:55,571 --> 01:19:57,573
Kellie, please,
I'll watch this horse.

1330
01:19:57,573 --> 01:20:01,566
Brandon, stop bothering her.

1331
01:20:08,584 --> 01:20:09,585
Sorry, you guys.

1332
01:20:09,585 --> 01:20:12,588
I've had something
to say to you for a long time.

1333
01:20:12,588 --> 01:20:14,590
I didn't want to hurt you.

1334
01:20:14,590 --> 01:20:17,593
I wouldn't do it for nothing
in the world.

1335
01:20:17,593 --> 01:20:19,595
- You don't have to tell me.
- I do.

1336
01:20:19,595 --> 01:20:23,588
I got to say it for myself.
I've been with other girls.

1337
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:28,604
I ain't got no excuses.
Ain't your fault.

1338
01:20:28,604 --> 01:20:32,608
You done the best you could
by me, and I failed you.

1339
01:20:32,608 --> 01:20:34,610
We've both made mistakes, Lane.

1340
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:37,613
When you told me,
I wasn't even mad at you.

1341
01:20:37,613 --> 01:20:41,606
All them things I said,
I should've said to myself.

1342
01:20:43,619 --> 01:20:47,612
I'm sorry, Kel.

1343
01:20:48,624 --> 01:20:52,617
I love you, Kel.

1344
01:20:53,629 --> 01:20:56,632
I don't want it anymore.

1345
01:20:56,632 --> 01:20:57,633
I want to spend my time
with you...

1346
01:20:57,633 --> 01:21:00,636
wake up with you
in a real house...

1347
01:21:00,636 --> 01:21:04,640
and know I don't gotta go
somewhere to a damn rodeo.

1348
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:08,644
That's what I want, too, Lane.

1349
01:21:08,644 --> 01:21:12,637
I'll make it up to you, Kel.
I love you.

1350
01:21:18,654 --> 01:21:21,657
Every eye is on this young man.

1351
01:21:21,657 --> 01:21:24,660
This is his third and final try
at riding Red Rock...

1352
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:28,664
now a bull
that's bucked off 311 cowboys.

1353
01:21:28,664 --> 01:21:30,666
Bear down there, Lane.

1354
01:21:30,666 --> 01:21:34,670
This is truly
a challenge of the champions.

1355
01:21:34,670 --> 01:21:37,673
This'll put you over the top.

1356
01:21:37,673 --> 01:21:40,676
OK, boys! OK, boys!

1357
01:21:40,676 --> 01:21:42,678
Will this be the first man
in rodeo history...

1358
01:21:42,678 --> 01:21:45,681
ever to ride Red Rock?

1359
01:21:45,681 --> 01:21:46,682
Go, Lane!

1360
01:21:46,682 --> 01:21:48,684
Look at this bull!

1361
01:21:48,684 --> 01:21:50,686
I've never seen an animal
try in more ways...

1362
01:21:50,686 --> 01:21:52,688
to get his rider off!

1363
01:21:52,688 --> 01:21:55,691
There he goes!
Can Lane Frost stay with him?

1364
01:21:55,691 --> 01:21:59,684
Got him!

1365
01:22:00,696 --> 01:22:01,697
You've got the bull ride...

1366
01:22:01,697 --> 01:22:05,690
you wanted to see in here
this afternoon!

1367
01:22:07,703 --> 01:22:09,705
He did it!

1368
01:22:09,705 --> 01:22:13,709
Lane Frost is the first man
to ride Red Rock to the whistle!

1369
01:22:13,709 --> 01:22:17,713
Not since Freckles Brown
rode Tornado...

1370
01:22:17,713 --> 01:22:21,706
in 1967 has there been a ride
to match this!

1371
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:28,713
Lane, you just won
your own page in rodeo history!

1372
01:22:38,734 --> 01:22:40,736
I ain't been on a bull
since April.

1373
01:22:40,736 --> 01:22:43,739
Everybody's expecting me
up to Cheyenne.

1374
01:22:43,739 --> 01:22:46,742
Tuff's fixing to get a plane.

1375
01:22:46,742 --> 01:22:48,744
Maybe I'll drive up there
and meet you.

1376
01:22:48,744 --> 01:22:50,746
They got a nice hotel.

1377
01:22:50,746 --> 01:22:53,749
Maybe we could get us
one of them suites...

1378
01:22:53,749 --> 01:22:56,752
with the big bubbling tub
and king-size bed.

1379
01:22:56,752 --> 01:22:59,755
How many cowboys are going to be
sleeping with us?

1380
01:22:59,755 --> 01:23:01,757
Just Tuff and Cody.

1381
01:23:01,757 --> 01:23:05,750
Of course,
they're family, you know.

1382
01:23:06,762 --> 01:23:09,765
Breeze feels nice, doesn't it?

1383
01:23:09,765 --> 01:23:12,768
Just a little further
on up here.

1384
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:15,771
Never ridden a horse
with a blindfold before.

1385
01:23:15,771 --> 01:23:17,773
Hang on.

1386
01:23:17,773 --> 01:23:21,766
OK, just a little further.

1387
01:23:26,782 --> 01:23:29,785
It's beautiful.

1388
01:23:29,785 --> 01:23:32,788
I'm gonna build your corrals
right up there.

1389
01:23:32,788 --> 01:23:34,790
On top of the hill there...

1390
01:23:34,790 --> 01:23:36,792
I'm gonna put me
some bucket chutes...

1391
01:23:36,792 --> 01:23:39,795
so I can have
a bull riding school.

1392
01:23:39,795 --> 01:23:42,798
Over here, I'll build you
a great big house.

1393
01:23:42,798 --> 01:23:44,800
Lots of kids running around.

1394
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,802
Right over here,
I'm gonna put that trailer...

1395
01:23:46,802 --> 01:23:49,805
with the big guitar on it.

1396
01:23:49,805 --> 01:23:51,807
You're kidding, aren't you?

1397
01:23:51,807 --> 01:23:55,811
No, I ain't kidding. Wouldn't
seem like home otherwise.

1398
01:23:55,811 --> 01:23:57,813
Please tell me
you're making a joke, Lane.

1399
01:23:57,813 --> 01:24:00,816
Yes, darling,
I'm making a joke.

1400
01:24:00,816 --> 01:24:04,809
I'm gonna put it right over
there next to your corrals.

1401
01:24:17,833 --> 01:24:19,835
Cody, read us a poem.

1402
01:24:19,835 --> 01:24:21,837
Give me a good reason to puke.

1403
01:24:21,837 --> 01:24:23,839
Just got one new one.

1404
01:24:23,839 --> 01:24:26,842
That's all right.

1405
01:24:26,842 --> 01:24:27,843
"There's a hundred years
of history...

1406
01:24:27,843 --> 01:24:29,845
"and a hundred 'fore that...

1407
01:24:29,845 --> 01:24:32,848
"all gathered in the thinking
goin' on beneath his hat.

1408
01:24:32,848 --> 01:24:34,850
"The cold flame
burns within him...

1409
01:24:34,850 --> 01:24:37,853
"till his skin's
as cold as ice...

1410
01:24:37,853 --> 01:24:38,854
"and the dues he paid...

1411
01:24:38,854 --> 01:24:41,857
"to get here
are worth every sacrifice.

1412
01:24:41,857 --> 01:24:43,859
"All the miles
spent sleepy drivin'...

1413
01:24:43,859 --> 01:24:45,861
"all the money down the drain...

1414
01:24:45,861 --> 01:24:48,864
"all the if Is and nearlys...

1415
01:24:48,864 --> 01:24:51,867
"all the bandages and pain...

1416
01:24:51,867 --> 01:24:53,869
"all the female tears
left dryin'...

1417
01:24:53,869 --> 01:24:56,872
"all the fever and the fight...

1418
01:24:56,872 --> 01:24:57,873
"are just a small
down payment...

1419
01:24:57,873 --> 01:24:59,875
"on the ride he makes tonight.

1420
01:24:59,875 --> 01:25:03,879
"It's guts and love and glory...

1421
01:25:03,879 --> 01:25:05,881
"one mortal's chance at fame.

1422
01:25:05,881 --> 01:25:08,884
"His legacy is Rodeo...

1423
01:25:08,884 --> 01:25:12,888
"and Cowboy is his name."

1424
01:25:12,888 --> 01:25:14,890
There it is, boys.

1425
01:25:14,890 --> 01:25:16,892
It's the dad, all right.

1426
01:25:16,892 --> 01:25:19,895
Yep. He's the daddy of 'em all.

1427
01:25:19,895 --> 01:25:21,897
Boys, let's go get some money.

1428
01:25:21,897 --> 01:25:25,901
Bull riding
in Cheyenne, Wyoming...

1429
01:25:25,901 --> 01:25:27,903
Gonna be a bull rider, Cody?

1430
01:25:27,903 --> 01:25:29,905
Yes, sir.

1431
01:25:29,905 --> 01:25:31,907
What's your name?

1432
01:25:31,907 --> 01:25:34,910
Brandon.

1433
01:25:34,910 --> 01:25:38,903
Looks like Tuff got tired
of being a hard-ass.

1434
01:25:43,919 --> 01:25:47,923
With that eighty-nine score
Jim Schott just turned in...

1435
01:25:47,923 --> 01:25:50,926
we're looking
at some wild bull riding...

1436
01:25:50,926 --> 01:25:52,928
here in old Cheyenne.

1437
01:25:52,928 --> 01:25:56,932
I think you'll have to be
in the nineties to place here.

1438
01:25:56,932 --> 01:25:59,935
There's no doubt this man is
an in-house favorite here today.

1439
01:25:59,935 --> 01:26:03,939
This is Lane Frost of Oklahoma,
seven times...

1440
01:26:03,939 --> 01:26:04,940
Whoa!

1441
01:26:04,940 --> 01:26:07,943
Bear down.
No need to be rude.

1442
01:26:07,943 --> 01:26:09,945
The best of bull riding.

1443
01:26:09,945 --> 01:26:12,948
Let's win some money.

1444
01:26:12,948 --> 01:26:13,949
Ride 'em, champ!

1445
01:26:13,949 --> 01:26:15,951
OK, boys!

1446
01:26:15,951 --> 01:26:19,944
All right!

1447
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:28,953
Watch this cowboy
as he tries to ride this bull!

1448
01:26:39,975 --> 01:26:42,978
Friends, this may be
the wildest steer...

1449
01:26:42,978 --> 01:26:44,980
that we're watching right here!

1450
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:45,981
Plenty strong!

1451
01:26:45,981 --> 01:26:46,982
Go, Lane!

1452
01:26:46,982 --> 01:26:50,975
All right!

1453
01:26:51,987 --> 01:26:53,989
Tell you one thing,
ladies and gentlemen...

1454
01:26:53,989 --> 01:26:56,992
you have just watched
some kind of great bull ride...

1455
01:26:56,992 --> 01:27:00,985
by that champion cowboy!

1456
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,002
A nasty punch from that bull!

1457
01:27:07,002 --> 01:27:10,995
This man may be hurt!

1458
01:27:12,007 --> 01:27:16,011
Sure hope this is not an injury
of a serious nature.

1459
01:27:16,011 --> 01:27:20,015
You don't see these cowboys
call for help very often.

1460
01:27:20,015 --> 01:27:22,017
Paramedics are on their way in.

1461
01:27:22,017 --> 01:27:26,010
Lane has ridden that bull
for ninety-two points.

1462
01:28:00,055 --> 01:28:03,058
I been sitting here...

1463
01:28:03,058 --> 01:28:07,051
trying to remember
if I ever told him...

1464
01:28:11,066 --> 01:28:14,069
if I told him
I was proud of him.

1465
01:28:14,069 --> 01:28:18,073
I know...

1466
01:28:18,073 --> 01:28:22,066
that he did a good job.

1467
01:28:26,081 --> 01:28:30,085
But I...

1468
01:28:30,085 --> 01:28:34,078
I can't remember...

1469
01:28:35,090 --> 01:28:39,094
a single time...

1470
01:28:39,094 --> 01:28:43,098
I told him...

1471
01:28:43,098 --> 01:28:47,091
I loved him.

1472
01:29:00,115 --> 01:29:02,117
It's warming up a bit.

1473
01:29:02,117 --> 01:29:06,110
Yeah, think so.

1474
01:29:11,126 --> 01:29:15,119
They're giving a special award
for Lane at the Finals.

1475
01:29:16,131 --> 01:29:20,124
They want you to accept it.

1476
01:29:30,145 --> 01:29:31,146
You do it, Tuff.

1477
01:29:31,146 --> 01:29:35,139
They'd like for you
to be there, Kellie.

1478
01:29:42,157 --> 01:29:46,150
I have to start a new life.

1479
01:29:47,162 --> 01:29:49,164
I'm going back to school.

1480
01:29:49,164 --> 01:29:53,157
I'm trying to make some plans.

1481
01:29:54,169 --> 01:29:58,162
It's just too hard to be
around rodeo right now.

1482
01:30:10,185 --> 01:30:14,178
Back in the spring, Lane said...

1483
01:30:15,190 --> 01:30:17,192
"This is your year."

1484
01:30:17,192 --> 01:30:21,185
That I'd win the championship.

1485
01:30:26,201 --> 01:30:30,194
I told him he was full of it.

1486
01:30:36,211 --> 01:30:40,215
Now it's only a week away,
and...

1487
01:30:40,215 --> 01:30:44,208
I really think
that I got a chance.

1488
01:30:52,227 --> 01:30:56,220
I never had anybody
believe that much in me.

1489
01:31:02,237 --> 01:31:06,230
He really loved you, Tuff.

1490
01:31:21,256 --> 01:31:24,259
It's been in the papers.
You've seen it on TV.

1491
01:31:24,259 --> 01:31:26,261
Tuff Hedeman has declared
he'll win the World Title...

1492
01:31:26,261 --> 01:31:30,265
in memory of
his fallen partner Lane Frost.

1493
01:31:30,265 --> 01:31:32,267
Remember, Frost was killed
last summer at Cheyenne...

1494
01:31:32,267 --> 01:31:34,269
when a broken rib
pierced his heart.

1495
01:31:34,269 --> 01:31:38,273
Tuff is dedicating his last ride
to the memory of his friend.

1496
01:31:38,273 --> 01:31:39,274
OK, boys!

1497
01:31:39,274 --> 01:31:43,267
All he's got to do is beat
that eighty-nine-point-five.

1498
01:31:44,279 --> 01:31:48,283
Good little bull ride
started here.

1499
01:31:48,283 --> 01:31:51,286
He's showing some determination
to really ride!

1500
01:31:51,286 --> 01:31:55,290
Look at him! He's proving
what he said he could do!

1501
01:31:55,290 --> 01:31:56,291
He did it!

1502
01:31:56,291 --> 01:31:58,293
What a bull ride!

1503
01:31:58,293 --> 01:32:01,296
We'll have that score
coming up for Tuff Hedeman!

1504
01:32:01,296 --> 01:32:04,299
Is he hung up?

1505
01:32:04,299 --> 01:32:08,303
No. He's riding for Lane now.

1506
01:32:08,303 --> 01:32:10,305
Remember he dedicated it?

1507
01:32:10,305 --> 01:32:13,308
I'll betcha somebody's smiling
upstairs right now.

1508
01:32:13,308 --> 01:32:15,310
Ride him!

1509
01:32:15,310 --> 01:32:19,303
Lane Frost,
he's riding for you, my friend.

1510
01:32:41,336 --> 01:32:42,337
Ninety-one points!

1511
01:32:42,337 --> 01:32:46,330
Your new
World's Champion cowboy!

1512
01:33:41,396 --> 01:33:44,399
I feel like he's with me
all the time.

1513
01:33:44,399 --> 01:33:46,401
I know deep down in my heart...

1514
01:33:46,401 --> 01:33:50,394
he was the greatest influence
that I ever had.

1515
01:40:55,830 --> 01:40:56,831
Don't be afraid to go after...

1516
01:40:56,831 --> 01:40:59,834
what you want to do
and what you want to be.

1517
01:40:59,834 --> 01:41:03,827
But don't be afraid
to be willing to pay the price.
