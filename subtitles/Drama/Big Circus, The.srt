<i>Why isn't anyone helping me get up?</i>

3
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,080
<i>Why?</i>

4
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,340
<i>Let's just end this here.</i>

5
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,200
<i>This is too hard.</i>

6
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,920
<i>It's just too hard.</i>

7
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,470
<i>No.</i>

8
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,090
<i>I have to live.</i>

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,250
<i>I want to live.</i>

10
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,710
<i>Someone...</i>

11
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,350
<i>Someone grab me.</i>

12
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,350
<i>I want someone to grab me!</i>

13
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,590
How much do you think
this building costs?

14
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,540
Excuse me?

15
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,290
Do you think that there's
anyone out there

16
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,500
who'd want to exchange
their life for this?

17
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,310
By any chance...

18
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,300
Do you know of any
restrooms in the area

19
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,310
where a lot of homeless
people frequents?

20
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,470
What?

21
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,320
I'm sorry, but the patients in this
area needs absolute peace and quiet.

22
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,280
You cannot interview
anyone in this area.

23
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,530
Mr. Kang Ji Hyuk is
admitted here, isn't he?

24
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,800
Yes, he is.

25
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,800
Then I guess we can't do
anything else about it.

26
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,470
I'm sure he'll have
to come out sometime.

27
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,680
Let's just wait for him.

28
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,570
- Yes, Director.
- How's his condition now?

29
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,780
Okay.

30
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,030
Don't let him out of your sight
until I get there.

31
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,850
Okay.

32
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,820
Add him to the family registry quickly.

33
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,430
But all the reporters
are there already.

34
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,070
Reporters?

35
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,650
There's Kang Ji Hyuk right there.

36
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,930
Is it true that you're
Chairman Kang Sung Wook's hidden son?

37
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,710
What's the reason for keeping
that truth a secret all this time?

38
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,540
How do you think things will change as
you come on board as a new heir?

39
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,100
When did you find out that you're
Chairman Kang Sung Wook's son?

40
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,990
Is that fact related to
your recent accident?

41
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,570
What are you guys talking about?

42
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,920
- Aren't you Mr. Kang Ji Hyuk?
- Kang Ji Hyuk?

43
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,830
My name is Kim Ji Hyuk.

44
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,270
<i>Ji Hyuk.</i>

45
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,370
Ji Hyuk.

46
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,260
What a relief to see that you're okay.

47
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,600
I'm so glad to see you, Ji Hyuk.

48
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,510
Do you remember anything
from your childhood?

49
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,770
No.

50
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,930
I don't remember a thing.

51
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,790
Let's not rush anything.

52
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,310
Once we come to terms with our own
emotions, and get used to each other

53
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,670
I'm sure we'll be able to form a bond
as father and son, and as family then.

54
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,110
You understand what I'm
saying, don't you?

55
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,340
No, I have no idea what you're saying.

56
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,420
Okay, I understand.

57
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,340
I'm sure you must be flustered since
that's the way I'm feeling right now.

58
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,690
What I'm saying is that we both should
take some time to get used to the idea.

59
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,600
Get some rest for now.

60
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,340
What do you do for a living?

61
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,700
You'll find that out soon enough.

62
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,760
Do I have a mother?

63
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,650
Of course you do.

64
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,110
Really?

65
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,830
- Does she know?
- Of course.

66
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,290
You should've just let
the sleeping dogs lie.

67
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,000
We're just going to complicate
everything for one another.

68
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,060
I can't do that.

69
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,930
Because you're my son.

70
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,370
Because I'm your son?

71
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,820
What's the point of seeking me out now?

72
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,010
Why are they getting so curious about
our family registry all of a sudden?

73
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,100
I think they received a request
from the investigators.

74
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,760
I think they must've
discovered something

75
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,160
that may have been
done illegally.

76
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,210
Ugh, why now of all times?

77
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,250
Forget it. I don't
think we need to worry

78
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,310
about it since the
office will soon change.

79
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,950
Did you look into the foreign matters
that I told you to look into?

80
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,900
Yes, I think we'll get an
answer from them soon.

81
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,180
You think it'll work?

82
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,980
I think there's more than
a 90 percent chance that it will.

83
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,180
Is that right?

84
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,270
And one more thing.

85
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,330
That guy...

86
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,250
I want you to confuse him. Throw money,
women, and whatever else at him.

87
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,570
So that he doesn't have a chance
to think about anything else.

88
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,700
Yes, Sir.

89
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,360
That's the life history
of Mr. Kang Ji Hyuk

90
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,350
that we have of
him up to this point.

91
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,210
Don't you rather that you didn't know
any of that?

92
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,830
- Why do I have to know any of this?
- Because he's part of the family.

93
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,910
He's someone whom you need to serve.

94
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,630
I started searching for Kang Ji Hyuk's

95
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,800
whereabouts about a year ago
per Chairman Kang's orders.

96
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,720
I found out about Kang Ji
Hyuk's existence very recently

97
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,560
and I was able to find
his DNA records purely

98
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,420
by coincidence from
his recent accident.

99
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,950
That's the result of all my findings.

100
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,330
I just prepared some things that
I thought you may need for the moment.

101
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,800
Just let me know if there's
anything else that you need.

102
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,550
And one more thing.

103
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,490
This is the key to the car
that you'll be driving.

104
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,480
Let me know if the car
isn't to your liking

105
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,010
and I'll swap it out
for something else.

106
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,160
Are you trying to recruit me right now?

107
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,830
You know how those sports teams always
gets the players whatever they want

108
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,240
when trying to recruit them?

109
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,930
Getting them an amazing place to live
with a fancy car to boot.

110
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,370
There's no one in this world
who tries to recruit a son.

111
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,850
I'm sure you guys can do all this
since that guy has so much money.

112
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,140
Anyways, this is nice.

113
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,680
Getting a chance to live...

114
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,740
in an amazing place like this
for having met a nice set of parents.

115
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,800
Money sure is nice.

116
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:36,340
<i>I want you to bring that scoundrel
back here and rip his heart out!</i>

117
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,210
What floor are we even on?

118
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,680
Crap!

119
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,010
Thank you.

120
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:21,010
For some strange reason,
I keep having to receive help from you.

121
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,610
Um...

122
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,570
Call me anytime if there's
anything else that you need.

123
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,270
Yeah, sure.

124
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,460
But...

125
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,030
What is it that you do for them?

126
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,100
I'm an employee of Hyun Sung Group.

127
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,730
I take care of
Chairman Kang's family.

128
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,910
Really?

129
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,130
Then I guess you must get to see
those parents of mine pretty often?

130
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,340
- Yes, I do.
- Go give them a message for me.

131
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,370
Tell them that I'm
tearfully grateful for

132
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,890
buying me this grand
house and the fancy car.

133
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:05,620
The son that they just threw away
and abandoned for the past 30 years...

134
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,420
is speechless with utter gratefulness.

135
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,160
Please make sure to
relay that message.

136
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,730
Yes, Sir.

137
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,670
Now it's raining?

138
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,260
Well that's just depressing.

139
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,510
You told me to let you know if there's
anything else I might need, right?

140
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,680
Yes, tell me.

141
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,370
What is it that you need?

142
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,910
An extra umbrella so
that I may be able to

143
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,470
shield a lady from getting
soaked in the rain.

144
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,540
Dong Suk.

145
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,050
You're going to get up from that bed
as if nothing even happened, right?

146
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,020
I've been so afraid...

147
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,630
and because of that...

148
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,110
I've never even once got to
tell you that I love you.

149
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:48,060
So please just get up from that bed.

150
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,100
I can't live without you.

151
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,730
Oh my, look who it is!
Ji Hyuk's here.

152
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,010
Yes, it's me.

153
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,510
- Are you well?
- Of course!

154
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,400
Why are you still following me?

155
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,380
It's my job to do so.

156
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,100
Mom!

157
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,190
- Mom!
- What are you doing!

158
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,550
Get away from me!
You're grossing me out!

159
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,860
Mom, do you have any idea
how much I've missed you?

160
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,080
- You must've been so worried about me.
- Don't' talk crazy.

161
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,160
Why would I worry about you?
I'm busy enough as is with my own life.

162
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,520
Excuse me, but are you his mother?

163
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,470
His mother?
Mother, my butt.

164
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,910
He thinks that all the middle aged
women in this world are his mom.

165
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,000
Especially if there's something
that he can gain from the woman.

166
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,310
I bet he probably has
more than 30 women

167
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,640
in this market alone
whom he calls 'mom'.

168
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,870
No, Mom.
They're just regular moms.

169
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,830
But you're my mom.

170
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,250
Stop kissing my face.
Hey!

171
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,280
Where and what have you been
doing these past few days?

172
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,860
And... who is this young lady?

173
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,400
Did you cause another accident?

174
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,900
Accident?

175
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,730
Yeah, I did.
A huge accident.

176
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,190
You didn't.

177
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,350
- Before you're even married?
- Excuse me?

178
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,110
Come on, Mom!
What do you take me for?

179
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,460
You're painting a bad picture of me
in front of this lady.

180
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:20,830
Don't let her mislead you.
I'm much more virtuous than I may look.

181
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,520
Mrs. Hong!
Mrs. Hong, Ji Hyuk is...

182
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,070
Ji... Ji Hyuk!

183
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,860
Your Highness!

184
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,890
Please forgive me for
not having recognized

185
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,950
your status to have
served you properly.

186
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,310
I swear to pledge the rest of my life
in your servitude, Your Highness!

187
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,540
What's wrong with you now?

188
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,990
I told you that I caused
a slight accident.

189
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,010
- What is he talking about?
- Ji Hyuk is...

190
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,100
You know the company,
Hyun Sung Group, right?

191
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,210
Yeah.

192
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:52,280
He's that Chairman's son! It's all
over the internet and the newspapers!

193
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,820
- Is he serious?
- It's not a sure thing yet.

194
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:02,310
But that's what those
people are saying.

195
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,480
There's something that
I have to show you.

196
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,000
Is what I heard on the news... true?

197
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,250
What is it?

198
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,940
Is he mom's son too?

199
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,980
- Or is he just your son, Dad?
- Your mom gave birth to him.

200
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,850
Honey.

201
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:30,280
Madame Choi, he came from your womb.
You can't even remember that?

202
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,690
This is crazy.

203
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,470
Thanks, Dad.

204
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,710
You kept this a secret
for how many decades

205
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,400
just so that you could
surprise me like this?

206
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,300
I sincerely thank you. It was the
biggest surprise gift of my life.

207
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,240
Surprise!

208
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,390
What was the point of
lying to Jin Ah too?

209
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,580
Then you go tell
her the truth.

210
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,690
Tell her that we smacked a perfectly
healthy guy on his head

211
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:58,910
and lied about him
being our son just so

212
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,150
we could save
our own son's life.

213
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:03,020
Tell her that's how
evil her parents are.

214
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,710
Go tell her that.

215
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,580
Wow, this is like a scene
right out of a movie.

216
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,500
I feel like we're in a drama.
So they've

217
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,440
been watching you all this time?

218
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,120
Couldn't a document like this have
been forged if you guys had wanted to?

219
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,900
It's not like they were shot
in the head or something.

220
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,680
Why would they want to
claim you as their son?

221
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,620
What use could you be
to them when you've

222
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,570
got nothing to offer
them but your body?

223
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,980
Don't you agree?

224
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,220
If you have a hard time believing me,
I can get it authenticated for you.

225
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,390
Well... there's no need to go through
all that trouble.

226
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,680
Hey.

227
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,210
I think others are right about that.
You're being suspicious over nothing.

228
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:45,560
You should just be grateful that
they even sought out a son like you.

229
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,840
<i>I told you that I'm too
busy to come tomorrow.</i>

230
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,860
<i>What?</i>

231
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,950
Why do you have to put it like that?

232
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,600
Forget it.
I don't need your chump change.

233
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,420
You're the one who needs
to get it straight.

234
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,510
I'm hanging up.

235
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,740
- How unbelievable.
- Who was that?

236
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,970
That was Mr. Kim.

237
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,330
Mr. Kim from the butcher
shop at the market?

238
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,690
Yeah.

239
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,190
When I told him that I was going
to take the day off tomorrow

240
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,480
he threatened that he wasn't going
to pay me my wages that he owes me.

241
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,190
It's not like it's a lot of money.
It's just 100,000 won.

242
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,740
Maybe we should just
buy his butcher shop.

243
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,530
I bet 20-30 million won
is all we would need.

244
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:44,350
Ji Hyuk, since we're just
sitting around here,

245
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,630
should we call up those
girls for a date?

246
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,120
Don't you think that
they'd go out on a date

247
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,250
with us if we got them
a commercial deal?

248
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,050
- Dae Suk.
- Yeah?

249
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,050
Come over here.

250
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:02,920
We struggled through so much
all these years, haven't we?

251
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,330
I especially know how much
you struggled because of me.

252
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,770
Ji Hyuk.

253
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:10,090
Thank you so much for recognizing that.

254
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:12,480
There's no need to thank me.

255
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,980
Don't you know how well I know you?

256
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,610
You're...

257
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,230
What did you say, you jerk?
Buy the butcher shop?

258
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,130
Bite down.
Bite down real hard!

259
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,910
I'm sorry, Mr. Kim.

260
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,630
No, I had a few too much to drink,
and I must've been out of my mind.

261
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,910
I'm down on my knees right now.

262
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,930
Yes, I'll be there
first thing in the

263
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,390
morning, and get the
place sparkling clean.

264
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,650
Thank you, Mr. Kim.
Have a good night.

265
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,100
Satisfied?

266
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,560
Of course.

267
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,690
Don't you think that
you're being too harsh?

268
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,140
Let me enjoy some
of your spoils too.

269
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:59,820
And you should enjoy some of this too.
Doesn't this make you happy?

270
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,360
Your parents are filthy rich.

271
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,110
The parents that you've been wanting
to find all your life.

272
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,550
I didn't want to
find people like that.

273
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,990
Don't be a fool.

274
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,120
I'm sure you must've missed them.
They're your mom and dad.

275
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,140
I was curious to know who they were.

276
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,210
Curious to see how
they were living after

277
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,300
throwing their own child
out on the streets.

278
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,250
But...

279
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,780
they're living a high and mighty life.
Not only that, but they're chaebols.

280
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,200
I definitely didn't want to find
parents like that.

281
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,880
That's why I'm not as resentful.

282
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,660
I was about to get
really pissed about it.

283
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,450
<i>Ji Hyuk.</i>

284
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,120
It's time for you to get
down from there now.

285
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:57,640
Your mom and dad aren't coming today.

286
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,020
Just get down from there.

287
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,760
Mom...

288
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,050
Dad...

289
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:45,460
I received a call from China.
All the preparations are complete.

290
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,830
Really?

291
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,260
- When did they say is possible?
- They said it can be done at anytime.

292
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,770
We said we would prepare the
medical team on our end.

293
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:55,290
We just have to send the team
as soon they are ready.

294
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,310
Good job.
You did nice work.

295
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,960
And also... I've been giving some
thought to the issue with our guy.

296
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,180
What do you think of sending him to
our branch office in the Philippines?

297
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,000
- To the Philippines?
- Yes.

298
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,160
Kidnapping is a frequent
occurrence over there,

299
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,350
and the chances of
recovering the victim is...

300
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,380
Okay, you do what you think is best.

301
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,280
Yes, Sir.
I will take care of it.

302
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,620
Yeah, what is it?

303
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,800
What?
Who's there?

304
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,820
That bastard is going to drive me
out of my mind.

305
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,520
This is a house?

306
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,450
Ugh, what's wrong with my eyes?

307
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,160
You!

308
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,250
Are you by any chance...

309
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,910
Are you Jin Ah?

310
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:44,080
- It's great to meet you!
- It's you, isn't it?

311
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,160
You're that trash.

312
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,510
How can you call a person
you just met, 'trash'?

313
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,290
- You have a nasty habit with words.
- Hey!

314
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,840
Do you know how much suffering
you put me through?

315
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,870
I think that you must be
mistaken about something.

316
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,780
But I've never met you
before in my life.

317
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,710
Anyways, it's great to meet you!

318
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,570
Have you lost your mind?
Let go of my hand.

319
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,800
I'm going to report you
for sexual harassment.

320
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,800
<i>What's going on out here?</i>

321
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,510
- Who are you?
- Mom.

322
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,980
Wait... you're...

323
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,240
You're...

324
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,820
Hello.

325
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,470
Mom, you know this guy?

326
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,200
<i>His name is Kang Ji Hyuk.</i>

327
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,800
He's your older brother.

328
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,470
This trash is my brother?

329
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:39,290
Dear God!
Thank you so much!

330
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:41,780
I feel so much better now.

331
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,320
We're going to take our
own doctors too, so

332
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,890
the surgery shouldn't
be a problem at all.

333
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,440
Dear God... thank you!

334
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,240
And that scoundrel, Ji Hyuk, won't be
coming around you anymore after today.

335
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:57,890
- I'm thinking of sending him overseas.
- Overseas?

336
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,100
Okay.

337
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,930
So treat him like
a real mother would for the night

338
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:08,670
so that he doesn't become
suspicious of anything.

339
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,570
For one last time.

340
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:13,550
Okay.

341
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,690
I guess what they say about blood
being thicker than water must be true.

342
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:29,460
Seeing how you two have already met
by chance like that.

343
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,500
This makes no sense.

344
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,400
I cannot accept any of this.
This seriously can't be happening.

345
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,990
Why of all people...

346
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,000
I should've called to
invite you over sooner.

347
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,390
But everything just
happened so suddenly,

348
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,810
and I needed some time
to prepare myself.

349
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,350
So... are you liking the house...
that you're living in right now?

350
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:58,370
- Yes.
- That's a relief.

351
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,790
- Is there anything else you need?
- No, there isn't.

352
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,970
I see.

353
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,500
- Um...
- Um...

354
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,860
You go ahead first, Honey.

355
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,660
I wasn't... oh, okay.

356
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:16,730
We really... would like to do something
really nice for you.

357
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:20,470
We know that you've had to suffer
quite a bit all these years.

358
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,360
We'd like to send you
on a trip overseas.

359
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,130
Why did you abandon me?

360
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,580
- Huh?
- Huh?

361
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,280
We didn't abandon you...

362
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,740
we lost you.

363
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,370
Then...

364
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:42,160
why seek me out now...

365
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,930
when you haven't sought me out
all these years?

366
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,250
Yeah, I've been curious about that too.

367
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,670
I've never once in my
life heard anything

368
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,110
about me having another
older sibling.

369
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,360
What's the reason for having
kept it a secret from me too?

370
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,070
That's because...

371
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,810
Why don't we do this?

372
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,770
Let's just...

373
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,030
Let's just live our lives
with some distance between us?

374
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,420
Instead of trying to force some
feelings that doesn't even exist.

375
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,130
I think that's the best thing to do.

376
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,350
Thanks for the tea.

377
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,690
I didn't want to tell anyone.

378
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:46,220
Because I wanted to
forget what had happened.

379
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,700
Whenever I would think of you...

380
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:54,190
I thought that my heart
would rip to shreds...

381
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,030
and I couldn't handle
the agonizing pain.

382
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,350
I've never once...

383
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,920
in all these years...

384
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,790
have ever stopped...

385
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,810
thinking about you.

386
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,490
I just hoped and prayed...

387
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,520
that you were still alive.

388
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,320
All I prayed for...

389
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,330
was that you were somehow still alive.

390
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:31,790
I prayed... every single night for you.

391
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,630
Thank you for still being alive.

392
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:43,600
Thank you... Thank you so
much for still being alive!

393
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,870
Thank you... thank you!

394
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,450
Thank you for still being alive.

395
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,890
Thank you.

396
00:26:55,890 --> 00:27:00,090
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you for still being alive.

397
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,370
What did you parents say?

398
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,550
The woman who calls herself my mom...

399
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:48,080
held my hand and cried.

400
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:55,330
Yeah... I can't even imagine
how much you mom must've missed you.

401
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,510
Didn't you feel something when you
held your mom's hand?

402
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,600
You felt the warmth of
your mom's hand, right?

403
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,310
I'm not sure.

404
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,720
Holding a mom's hand...

405
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,980
That's something
I never got to experience before.

406
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,210
There's no need for you to worry.

407
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,090
His health has deteriorated to a point

408
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:06,830
where the success rate is almost
at a hundred percent right now.

409
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,790
There's almost no chance
of any side effects either.

410
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,290
Being a parent is so hard.

411
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,310
<i>I'll wait for you with
a smile on my face.</i>

412
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,760
<i>Dong Suk.</i>

413
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:49,260
- Why are you being so loud?
- They want the Golden Boat!

414
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:53,060
- What's a 'Golden Boat'?
- I need everyone's attention!

415
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:58,070
In celebration of His Highness, Ji Hyuk,
having found his birth parents

416
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:01,640
he has offered to pay the drink tab
for everyone that's here tonight!

417
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,870
Hey!
I'm not paying for everyone's tab!

418
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:11,300
- Your parents are filthy rich!
- I'm not rich. Those people are rich.

419
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:15,570
That whole thing about the
Golden Boat is void, okay?

420
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:17,960
You have to pay for
your own drink tabs.

421
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,790
Don't be misled by what you have seen
or heard on the news, okay?

422
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,380
I'm not a rich family's son.

423
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:27,470
I'm just one of you guys
here at Guchangdo Market.

424
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:32,160
Don't feel awkward around me, and treat
me casually like you've always done.

425
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:34,370
- Let's cheers.
- Okay, fine.

426
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:36,470
If that's what you really
want, then go ahead.

427
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,590
But you have to pay for
our drink tabs, okay?

428
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,030
Okay, fine!
It'll be my treat!

429
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:44,470
But I'm not paying for the snacks too.
Just your drink tabs, okay?

430
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,520
- Okay, it's a deal!
- Wait! But no beers.

431
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:50,590
You can only get soju.

432
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,920
Who even drinks beer
anymore these days?

433
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,270
It's just expensive and filling.

434
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,990
Okay, then drink as
much as you'd like.

435
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,730
Okay, we'll take that.

436
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,190
A round of applause!

437
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:06,540
The guy who calls that a real treat,
and those that are satisfied with it...

438
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:09,030
You guys are all the same!
Why are you all so cheap!

439
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,230
Ms. Mi Ra!

440
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,120
The heir to the Hyun Sung
Group is going to

441
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,210
treat in celebration of
finding his parents.

442
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,920
But he only offered to pay for soju,
and we're not allowed to get any beer.

443
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,560
Don't you think that's an insult
to Hyun Sung Group's name?

444
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:28,640
I understand. I will pay for
everything with my company card.

445
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:30,540
Really?

446
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,010
Everything that these
people are having?

447
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:35,190
Yes, that won't be a problem.

448
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:37,980
You heard her, right?
Everything is on her!

449
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,350
Hurray for Ji Hyuk!

450
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,740
No, that's not the
right thing to say.

451
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:46,460
Ji Hyuk didn't pay for a thing.
We should hurray for Ms. Mi Ra.

452
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:51,190
- Everyone hurray for Ms. Mi Ra!
- Hurray for Ms. Mi Ra!

453
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,860
Here, let me pour you your first drink.

454
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,650
Hey, does she look like
the sort of person

455
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:00,460
who'd drink soju in a
filthy place like this?

456
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:02,130
You just don't get it.

457
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,500
I'm sorry.

458
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,580
I'll take you to a fancy place later
and buy you a glass of red wine.

459
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,920
No, I'll accept that drink.

460
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,640
Drink the whole thing.
Wow, she's a good drinker!

461
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,540
Let me pour you one too.

462
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,160
<i>Wow, what a great drinker!</i>

463
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,650
- Let me pour you a drink too.
- Stop feeding her drinks!

464
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,870
You scoundrel.
Just because she's your girlfriend...

465
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,810
- She's not my girlfriend.
- Let me see that.

466
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:55,920
Here.

467
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,880
If you're going to start
dating this rascal,

468
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,870
then you have to let
me pour you a drink.

469
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,300
If you don't,
then I can't give you my blessing.

470
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:05,150
- No, don't give her another drink!
- No.

471
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:08,730
I'll accept just one more drink
since you're already here.

472
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:13,470
I like your style.
Here, let me pour you one.

473
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:16,590
Take good care of our
Ji Hyuk for us, okay?

474
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,520
Sure!

475
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:23,710
I think you've had enough.
Let's get you up.

476
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:27,770
Are you okay?

477
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:30,910
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Let's go before you drink anymore.

478
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:34,920
Where do you think you're going?

479
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:38,070
She can't leave
until she sings us a song first.

480
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,330
Sing a song right now?

481
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:43,240
You think it's okay to just
let them go or not?

482
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,660
No, of course not!

483
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,540
What are you guys doing!

484
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:53,020
What do you think you're doing!

485
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,140
Ms. Mi Ra.

486
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,560
<i>What a nice singer!</i>

487
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,950
Ms. Mi Ra.

488
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,420
Ms. Mi Ra, wake up.

489
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,360
Is this the right place?

490
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:05,430
Thank you.

491
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:10,140
Thank you for still being alive.

492
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,640
Which one's your house?

493
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,480
I'll take you home.

494
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,580
Forget it.

495
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:36,100
Stop worrying about me,
and you just worry about yourself.

496
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,740
Me?

497
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,330
But I'm fine.

498
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:44,420
Look here, Mr. Kang Ji Hyuk.

499
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:48,090
Let me give you a piece of advice.

500
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:52,120
But don't get your pride all ruffled up
where it's not needed.

501
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,640
Take the money and
spend it all you like,

502
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:57,180
and do everything you've
ever wanted to do.

503
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:59,710
Buy everything you've
ever wanted to buy, and

504
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,840
eat everything you've
ever wanted to eat.

505
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:04,130
That's what you should do.

506
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:06,040
Why aren't you doing any of that?

507
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,230
Why?

508
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:09,720
Why aren't you spending any money
when they're telling you to?

509
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,020
Spend as much as you'd like!

510
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:12,880
I've never once...

511
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:15,520
thought of their money as mine.

512
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,820
That's why... that's why you're a fool.

513
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,670
- A fool.
- Excuse me?

514
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,450
Thank you for still being alive.

515
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:54,200
This is a nice neighborhood.

516
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:21,420
Can you come over here and
help me pick one out?

517
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,660
I've never been overseas before,
so I'm not sure which one to get.

518
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,980
Um... why didn't you ever join
a girl group or something?

519
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,900
Excuse me?

520
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,410
I don't think it's
too late for you yet.

521
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:48,160
You should start training or something.
You're a pretty good singer.

522
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,770
What are you talking about?

523
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,710
- You don't remember last night?
- No, not at all.

524
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,660
You must've been really
drunk last night.

525
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,390
I understand.

526
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:02,720
Because I myself confuse my dreams from
reality from time to time when I drink.

527
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,210
What do you think about this one?

528
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:13,740
Let me know if you need anything else.

529
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,770
No, I'm all set with this.

530
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,780
I forgot you told me to
go spend all my money.

531
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,430
I should just blow all my money here.

532
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:29,060
You called me a fool and
told me to spend all my money.

533
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:32,910
Let's go. I'm going to blow
some serious money on you today.

534
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,820
No. I didn't tell you to
spend it on someone else.

535
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,790
I told you to spend it on yourself...

536
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,560
So you do remember.

537
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,050
You should've told me
that you remember!

538
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,570
Why are you trying to lie to me?

539
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:46,140
Let's go. I'll show
you how I can spend...

540
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,740
No, please don't
be like this.

541
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,510
Everyone can make a mistake or two
when they're drunk. Let's go.

542
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,090
I told you to stop doing this!

543
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:58,250
- I was just...
- I'm sorry, but I'm working right now.

544
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,620
I hope that we don't make
things uncomfortable

545
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,260
for each other
while I'm working.

546
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,740
<i>Mr. Kang Ji Hyuk?</i>

547
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,790
I'm Reporter Bae from WVS News.

548
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:11,130
I met you at the hospital.
Can you give me an interview?

549
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,420
- What do you think?
- Huh?

550
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,690
- What interview?
- I'm sorry, but we must get going.

551
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,080
- I just need a few minutes.
- No, I'm sorry.

552
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,720
Mr. Kang Ji Hyuk!
Wait!

553
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:22,450
What did you and the
Chairman talk about?

554
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,620
I told you that you
can't interview him.

555
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,810
What did you two talk about?

556
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:26,340
Where does your shares
stand compared to

557
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,890
Director Kang Dong
Suk at the company?

558
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:30,120
I told you that you
can't interview him!

559
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:31,950
Reporter Bae!

560
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:41,510
Don't you think that it's time for you
to make a move in your career?

561
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:46,060
If a man like you came to
work for me at my company

562
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,990
I have a feeling that we could be
quite successful together.

563
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,360
Sir.

564
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:51,400
Why don't you just be frank with me?

565
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:53,990
What is it that you
want to hear from me?

566
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,710
I'll just be honest with you
since you're my junior.

567
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:59,270
Why do you keep digging
around my company?

568
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,990
You know a man by the name
of Jung Won Tae, don't' you?

569
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:06,170
He was the prosecutor for
Seoul's eastern district?

570
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,130
- Yes, I know him.
- You owe him a debt, don't you?

571
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:10,860
When he got transferred down to Busan?

572
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:14,050
Are you saying that I'm responsible
for his transfer?

573
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:18,720
It has been decided that he'll be
promoted to Chief Prosecutor.

574
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,580
Even though he's slightly starting to
dig around right now

575
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:23,370
he's going to get serious about it
once he's officially promoted.

576
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:26,840
I think it would be wise for you to
prepare yourself for a serious battle.

577
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,260
Ta da!

578
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,960
- Study hard, okay?
- Okay!

579
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,170
Okay, next!

580
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:03,560
- Thank you!
- You're so cute! How old are you?

581
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,400
- I'm five years old.
- You're five?

582
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,720
Study hard, okay?

583
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,000
I want something else.

584
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:20,370
- Just take what you're given.
- I want a robot too!

585
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:23,090
I don't have another robot.
Just take the pink pencil case.

586
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:25,430
I want a robot!

587
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:26,760
You little rascal.

588
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,310
Give it back if you don't want it,
and I'll give it to someone else.

589
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:29,450
Next.

590
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,190
What?
Did you just kick me?

591
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:38,690
Would you look at this kid. How dare
you glare at an adult like that?

592
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:40,020
Come over here, you rascal.

593
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:43,000
Hey!
Get over here right now!

594
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,330
You've met your match today.
Come here!

595
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:50,720
Come over here right now!

596
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,870
How dare you act like I used to
when I was a kid?

597
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,780
I'm going to drown
you with my kisses!

598
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,210
Let go of me!

599
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:05,030
My Sister Mom!

600
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:08,100
This is not a lie, but I'm really
going to come here often from now on.

601
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:12,790
No, it's okay. Don't worry about me,
and you just go live a happy life.

602
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,090
Okay, always be healthy,
and I'm going to get going now.

603
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:17,750
No need to see me out.
I'm going to get going.

604
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,520
Ji Hyuk, wait.

605
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:22,200
I've been holding onto something
that may have helped you

606
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,890
if you ever wanted to
search for your parents.

607
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:26,200
But now that you've found your parents

608
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,880
there's no reason for me to
hang onto this anymore.

609
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:33,330
I think this may have been in the bag
that you were carrying with you.

610
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:41,570
<i>[I know that the
heavens will punish me</i>

611
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,740
<i>for abandoning my child
at this place...]</i>

612
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:46,030
<i>[But it's just too
difficult to raise</i>

613
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:48,050
<i>this child on my own
without his father.]</i>

614
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,510
Have you known about it too?

615
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:01,850
Excuse me?

616
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,360
I'm sure you were just doing
what you were told.

617
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,330
I have an urgent matter to tend to,
so I'll see you later.

618
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:15,660
What is this about?

619
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,590
If you could just tell me
what this is about...

620
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,550
Oh my goodness!

621
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:44,820
- What are you doing here?
- Where's mother's room?

622
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:47,050
- Mom isn't here right now.
- Is it over there?

623
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:28,030
Hey... you! You seem to be
mistaken about something here.

624
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,090
But we don't think
of you as family yet.

625
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:33,870
No, you'll never be our family.
Do you know why?

626
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:35,690
It's because you're trash.

627
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,100
Take a good look.

628
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,430
Do you actually think that you and I
look like siblings?

629
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:44,760
No.
Not even close.

630
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:47,350
Right?

631
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,070
You don't think so either.

632
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:00,860
What the hell is his deal?

633
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:06,350
- Straighten that out.
- Yes, Sir.

634
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:10,310
Yes, Lady Jin Ah.

635
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,220
<i>The caller you are trying
cannot be reached,</i>

636
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:21,120
<i>so please leave a
message at the tone.</i>

637
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,730
- Yes, Director.
- What happened?

638
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:35,460
Why did Kang Ji Hyuk suddenly
cause a scene over at the house?

639
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,730
By any chance...
did he catch on to what's going on?

640
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:44,330
I think Mr. Kang Ji Hyuk discovered
something at the orphanage.

641
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,280
Really?

642
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:50,260
Do you remember the thing that I told
you to prepare in case of an emergency?

643
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:51,850
We need to get it ready in a hurry.

644
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:54,300
Send out a team over to the company.

645
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,460
Okay.

646
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:55,460
Mr. Kang Ji Hyuk.
What brings you by here?

647
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:58,270
Where's Chairman Kang right now?

648
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:01,300
I'm actually trying to locate
where Chairman Kang is myself.

649
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,870
I think he may be away
on a business trip.

650
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:04,470
Can you get in touch with him?

651
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:06,020
I'm not sure.

652
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:07,180
I tried to reach him,
but I wasn't able to get a hold of him.

653
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:10,550
He may be in the middle of
an important meeting right now.

654
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:13,170
What is it that you
need to see him about?

655
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:16,400
There's something
that I need to verify with him.

656
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,500
Why don't you tell me what it is?

657
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:20,220
- I can check for you when I see him...
- No.

658
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:24,330
I'd like to speak to him
directly in person.

659
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:26,770
I'll just wait for him.

660
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,780
Is there something...

661
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:39,400
that you're disappointed
with the Chairman about?

662
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:42,340
It's been quite a
while since I started

663
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:44,260
working for Chairman
Kang and his family.

664
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:46,780
There's something
that I've learned in

665
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,180
all the years that
I've worked for them.

666
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:52,290
All the members of that family...
are weary of other people.

667
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,890
Just think about what it would be like
if you had just walked out of a bank

668
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:56,760
with a huge bag of cash on you.

669
00:47:57,170 --> 00:47:59,920
You begin to be suspicious of everyone
who walks by you.

670
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:05,880
Same goes for blood ties. No, blood
ties are even more suspicious.

671
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,910
Because closer a person is to you

672
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:10,080
higher the danger of that person
stabbing you in the back.

673
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:15,530
You cannot expect...

674
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:18,420
a normal family life
with people like that.

675
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:19,920
Is that right?

676
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:23,720
Then... why would people
like that falsely

677
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:26,190
forge up a family
registry document?

678
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,330
I have no idea what it is
that you're implying right now.

679
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:34,590
Looking at you right now...

680
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:38,310
I get the feeling that you know this
family better than anyone else.

681
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,120
Then I guess you must
know about it too.

682
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,200
What their true intentions are.

683
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:47,890
Mr. Kang Ji Hyuk.

684
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,480
You seem to be misunderstood
about something.

685
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:53,930
But you really are
the biological son of Chairman Kang.

686
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:06,450
There is only one reason why
anyone would show any kindness...

687
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,890
to a stray dog out on the streets.

688
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:17,480
It's so that they can devour the dog.

689
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,610
Then what do you think
the stray dog in

690
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,040
that situation must do
in order to survive?

691
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:29,270
The dog must rip them to shreds
as they try to attack.

692
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,850
That's the only way for
the dog to survive!

693
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:39,890
- What is it that you want from me?
- This is all a misunderstanding.

694
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:42,890
Do you know what kind of people
I hate the most in this world?

695
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:46,180
It's those who deceives
me about my parents!

696
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,460
No, that's not true.
You must believe me.

697
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,180
It seems as though
whatever you're hiding is

698
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:02,430
more important to you
than your own life.

699
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,540
Warn Chairman Kang for me.

700
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:08,230
Because I'm going to meet him
to get the truth out of him myself.

701
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:15,300
I'm not that generous of a person... so
you won't' get away easy the next time.

702
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:19,680
He's...

703
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:24,700
at the company's 48th
anniversary event right now.

704
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,160
Is Chairman Kang
in there right now?

705
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:53,910
No, he's not. But
Director Do is in there.

706
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,040
<i>He's on his way there right now.</i>

707
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,500
We don't need to explain
anything to him this time.

708
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:04,710
Just make it clean...
and get rid of him once and for all.

709
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:26,470
Don't go.

710
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:52,130
Please don't go.

711
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:54,180
I need to go and verify it for myself.

712
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:56,090
I need to find out who I really am.

713
00:51:56,410 --> 00:51:59,000
Just who it is that I really am.

714
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,160
Hold on.

715
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,030
Yes, I understand.

716
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:04,620
Move!
Move out of the way!

717
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:47,880
- Dad.
- You're here.

718
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:53,420
What is it that you're
wearing right now?

719
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:56,520
That guy came by the house earlier
and caused a huge ruckus.

720
00:53:56,890 --> 00:54:00,240
- Who did?
- Who do you think? Your firstborn son.

721
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,720
Let's talk about that later.

722
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:06,580
He's fake, isn't he?

723
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:11,210
- Chairman Cha... you came.
- Yes.

724
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:18,130
It's me.
We can't let that bastard go in there.

725
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:21,060
Stop him. Stop him even if
you have to ram him down.

726
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:06,850
What are you planning
to do in there?

727
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:08,350
I don't know what I'm
going to do either.

728
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,220
I believe that the
only reason Hyun Sung

729
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:12,670
has been able to endure
the past 48 years

730
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:15,110
was because of the efforts
put in by everyone at the company.

731
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:25,390
A leader with the correct set of
principles and experience...

732
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:26,970
and all the family
members at Hyun Sung who

733
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:28,560
followed that leadership
with loyalty.

734
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:35,300
I will do everything within my power

735
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:37,400
to grow the strength
further to last another

736
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:39,530
48 years, and longer
into the future.

737
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:42,880
My Hyun Sung family...

738
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,040
and everyone else who has
dedicated themselves

739
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:47,220
to the further future
growth of Hyun Sung...

740
00:56:57,850 --> 00:57:00,780
I hope that we can all join our efforts
to grow Hyun Sung into a company

741
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:02,300
that could become a
leader of the future

742
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:03,840
for the people of
this country...

743
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:07,810
I will take the lead to pave the way
for a brighter future.

744
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:20,120
Chairman Kang Sung Wook.

745
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:23,760
Tell me the truth.

746
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,270
Am I...

747
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,710
truly your son?

748
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,960
I would like to introduce
you all to the

749
00:57:40,970 --> 00:57:43,260
bright new future
of Hyun Sung Group.

750
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,660
He is the bright new leader who will be
the face of a new branch of Hyun Sung.

751
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:49,080
A man who will be leading
a whole new branch

752
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:51,060
of Hyun Sung into a
bright new future.

753
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:56,210
Allow me to introduce you all to
President Kang Ji Hyuk.

754
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:28,020
<i>Under the orders of
Chairman Kang Sung Wook...</i>

755
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:31,810
<i>I promise to all of
you that I will lead</i>

756
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:35,610
<i>Hyun Sung Group to a
new age of the future.</i>

757

[Next Episode Preview]

758
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,930
<i>President Kang Ji Hyuk?</i>

759
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:42,630
<i>Where did they find a
character like that?</i>

760
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,350
<i>Fight is all about speed.</i>

761
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:48,080
<i>One swift blow to the face,
and all his teeth will be knocked out.</i>

762
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:49,520
<i>This is in response to
the complaints that</i>

763
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:50,970
<i>we've received in regards
to your leadership.</i>

764
00:58:50,970 --> 00:58:52,610
<i>Are you trying to punish me?</i>

765
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:54,920
<i>Is that trash really my brother?</i>

766
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:58,330
<i>This is the final scene to the play.</i>

767
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:01,550
<i>Bringing Hyun Sung Group
down to the ground.</i>

768
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:04,210
<i>- A man is dead.
- Dead?</i>

769
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:07,540
<i>- Get rid of that jerk!
- This is my company!</i>
