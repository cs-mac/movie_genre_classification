1
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:53,353
INSPIRED BY THE LIFE AND
WORKS OF NELLY ARCAN

2
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:38,972
<i>Once upon a time there was a tavern</i>

3
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:43,710
<i>Where we used to raise a glass or two</i>

4
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:49,950
<i>Remember how we laughed away the hours</i>

5
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:54,491
<i>And dreamed of all
the great things we would do</i>

6
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,490
<i>Those were the days, my friend</i>

7
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,295
<i>We though! They'd never end</i>

8
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:09,271
<i>We'd sing and dance, forever and a day</i>

9
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:12,399
<i>We'd live the life we choose</i>

10
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:15,241
<i>We'd fight and never lose</i>

11
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:20,751
<i>For we were young and sure to have our way</i>

12
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,057
Come in.
Hi.

13
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:10,395
Pierre, right?
Yeah.

14
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:14,131
I'm Cynthia. I'm happy to meet you.

15
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,467
Me, too.

16
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:27,480
Have a seat.

17
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,895
This is my first time.

18
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,500
Do you think I'm attractive?

19
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,060
Yes.

20
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:51,733
Do you want me?
Yes.

21
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,736
I want you too.

22
00:03:56,703 --> 00:04:01,083
Some johns only want to talk,
and that's perfect too.

23
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,120
But you...

24
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,862
I'm glad you want to fuck me.

25
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,394
You turn me on.

26
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,236
I don't know why, but you turn me on.

27
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,539
You too.

28
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:34,315
Will you suck me?

29
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,047
It'll be my pleasure.

30
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:06,204
<i>Yes, life has pierced me through.</i>

31
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:18,816
<i>I didn't dream up those men,
the thousands in my bed, in my mouth.</i>

32
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:24,658
<i>I invented nothing of their sperm
on me, in my face, in my eyes.</i>

33
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,163
<i>I saw it all,</i>

34
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,530
<i>and it still goes on,</i>

35
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,865
<i>every day, or almost.</i>

36
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,855
<i>You owned everything already.</i>

37
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,943
<i>We were helpless against
the outcome of our encounter.</i>

38
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,139
<i>With you</i>

39
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:09,543
<i>I experienced the moments of languor
known to those who feel death approaching.</i>

40
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:52,640
I'm sorry, Suzanne.

41
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:54,545
I look horrible.

42
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,052
No, you're sublime, as always.

43
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:59,814
Thanks.
Come, we're late.

44
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,552
Are you OK? Ready for this?

45
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,460
Always.

46
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,920
I'm sorry for being late.

47
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:36,852
I'm systematically late, without fail.

48
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:39,419
It's like champagne...

49
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:42,931
<i>Beauty is a weapon that subjugates.</i>

50
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:51,499
<i>Beauty is an order that commands
immobility and contemplation by all.</i>

51
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:57,939
<i>One must compel others to stop living,
for the time they look,</i>

52
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,307
<i>force them to become an audience,</i>

53
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:06,054
<i>arrange them around you,
up in the bleachers.</i>

54
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,146
Here you have the Emperor.

55
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:33,682
That, with the Chariot...

56
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,147
A major professional success may await you.

57
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:41,414
But you have to be careful, go slow.

58
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,920
I won't bank on it.

59
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,155
Pack your bags, Isa. We're going on a trip!

60
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,565
My turn now!
Mom's sleeping, sweetie.

61
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:56,063
Move over, big girl.

62
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,172
Do you have a question?

63
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:14,620
The reversed Female Pope, the Hermit...

64
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,386
What?

65
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,289
Nothing.

66
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:22,229
Pick a different card.

67
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:32,074
<i>Something in me was always lacking.</i>

68
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,455
Yes?

69
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,425
Yes, speaking.

70
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,966
I was sleeping, yes.

71
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,669
It's 5:30.

72
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,640
No, that's alright.

73
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,114
Which publisher?

74
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,350
In Paris?

75
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,190
Yes, that's my manuscript.

76
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:31,529
Really?

77
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,001
Yes, it's very good news.

78
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,523
Mathieu?

79
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:56,057
Yes, that's me.

80
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:57,615
Hello.

81
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,289
I'm very pleased to meet you.
Me too.

82
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,333
It's an honor, miss.

83
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:12,903
It's not every day we travel to Canada
to meet a new author.

84
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,903
Your writing is magnificent.

85
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:18,709
Thank you.

86
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:24,154
Your text sent... a shock wave
through the editorial committee.

87
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:28,186
Whiskey.

88
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:33,486
I guess I'll have the same. Whiskey.

89
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,765
Is it your first novel?

90
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,730
Yes.

91
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,737
Have you been working on it long?

92
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,341
For a few months.

93
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,178
How old are you?

94
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:53,179
I'm 26.

95
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:58,511
You're very young.
I mean, for that style, that...

96
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:01,289
that density.

97
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:03,686
Thank you.

98
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,367
Is it based on your life?
Is it your own story?

99
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,370
Is that important?

100
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,102
No, it doesn't alter the book's quality.

101
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,972
We read you and want to know
everything about you.

102
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:27,947
Or to avoid you, perhaps.
But no one can remain indifferent.

103
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,619
Some things are true, others not.

104
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,756
Will you go on writing?

105
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,731
Apart from my writing,
I'm nothing.

106
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,568
Oh my god, your hair!

107
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:53,507
It's so awesome.

108
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:56,302
Girls' night out!

109
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,612
What smells? Did you cook?

110
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:03,248
It's gonna be awful.
No way.

111
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,980
It's gonna be amazing!

112
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,420
Hey, babe! Your top is way cool!

113
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:08,583
Thanks.

114
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,961
Nice shoes!
Thanks.

115
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:14,792
Time to drink!
Wanna do some shots?

116
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,797
I swear, she comes out
and says, all proud,

117
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:24,669
"The last john tipped me $200."

118
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,439
You just fucked him bareback.

119
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,550
How's it look?
Fuckin' A!

120
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,516
Did you buy it with him'?
No.

121
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:39,885
He brought a Holt's bag
and had me try it on.

122
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,014
He has taste.
Seriously.

123
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:44,184
No john ever gave me a dress.

124
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:47,195
But you're a great whore.
For sure.

125
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,559
Wanna check our reviews?
Yes!

126
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,164
No, not again!

127
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,300
Here we go.

128
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:01,070
There.
I'm ready to be humiliated.

129
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,412
Bad start, sweetie.

130
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:10,216
Must be the guy this aft.
What does the pig say'?

131
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,821
You're a fucking beauty!
Go on.

132
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:24,660
Asshole!

133
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,008
OK, fine, stop.

134
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:33,536
I have my fans.

135
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,115
What about the Goddess?

136
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,774
Come on, who cares?
No, keep going!

137
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,581
OK, the lovely Cynthia. 8:56 pm.

138
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,957
Warning, you'll be addicted
to Cynthia in no time.

139
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,959
Bitch! What's your secret?

140
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,788
Go on!
Cynthia is a beautiful young girl.

141
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,366
A magnificent body, gorgeous ass,

142
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,800
and breasts close to perfection.

143
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:03,236
She has soft skin and she smells divine.

144
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,865
I got a very sweet welcome.

145
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,807
Her photos are accurate, no bad surprises.

146
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,073
She's a natural, loves her work

147
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:13,945
as much as you do. She gets wet, moans...

148
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,382
She gave one of the best BJs ever.

149
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:20,252
Deep throat. Sucks like
she hasn't had cock in months.

150
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,656
She's ravenous, loves it.

151
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,261
No DATY, I don't know why.

152
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,557
She has the prettiest pussy.

153
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:28,825
Clean, shaven.

154
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,094
She said she never accepts being eaten.

155
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:36,104
You should see her ass doing doggy.
Anal costs more.

156
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,936
Cumshot, she swallowed every drop.

157
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:41,510
Beautiful eyes you can get lost in.

158
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,476
Guys, treat her well.

159
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,611
I like making love with you.

160
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:26,987
So do I.

161
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,891
I'm glad I found you.

162
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:38,327
Do you love me?

163
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,199
Yes.

164
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,902
You?

165
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:49,238
Yes.

166
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:54,179
I'm not a good girl, but I love you.

167
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,988
I'm not a good boy, but I love you.

168
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,518
We're in love!

169
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:31,587
We're in love!

170
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:08,889
<i>During this stage,</i>

171
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:14,496
<i>we lived the exaltation of our highs
and the crash of early mornings.</i>

172
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:26,573
<i>Your hand, bigger than god,
knew how to hit without hurting me.</i>

173
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,175
No!

174
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,773
Not the sun, Frankie! The sun's rising.
Come, vampire!

175
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:13,985
What's the plan?

176
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:16,386
Go to sleep?

177
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:19,026
Fuck sleep.

178
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,791
What time does Fred's dealer quit?
6 am.

179
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:26,563
It's 5:47.
Let's call him!

180
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:29,901
Take me away, my steed!

181
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,209
Suzanne!

182
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:52,811
Everything's good?
Marvelous.

183
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,321
How many drinks?

184
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:56,119
Just enough.

185
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:02,387
Guillaume Rival's here.

186
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:05,730
A rising star.
A genius, pure and simple.

187
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,461
The genius of the century, I'd say.

188
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:16,808
Where you going?
To meet this genius.

189
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,175
Are you sure?

190
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:23,481
The sky's the limit, little Suzie!

191
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:09,620
<i>It all happens to someone else.</i>

192
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,425
I'm there,

193
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:18,861
just next to myself.

194
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:24,931
I'm there watching,

195
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:29,403
but it's not really me.

196
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,883
I watch her.

197
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:39,913
I see her talking, drinking,

198
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,816
dancing, fucking,

199
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:44,451
laughing,

200
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,127
crying-

201
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:57,462
I see this blonde woman,
lying on the couch facing her analyst.

202
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,004
But I'm not that woman.

203
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,176
Though I play that woman well.

204
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:20,928
I need to be seen,

205
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,467
but it's not me I reveal.

206
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,937
So I disappear a bit.

207
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,807
Do you understand?

208
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,112
I appear to disappear.

209
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:50,957
Felix, from math class.

210
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:53,859
So you two are dating?
Yes.

211
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:55,987
Since when?
Monday.

212
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,726
He left me a letter in my locker.

213
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,165
He did'?
He said

214
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,463
I'm the prettiest girl in class.

215
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:06,537
That's so random!
No, it isn't.

216
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:11,977
Anyway, Tuesday after school
we went to the handball court.

217
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,982
By yourselves?
Yeah.

218
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:16,343
Did you french?

219
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:17,843
Yes.

220
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:21,150
That, and lots of other stuff.

221
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,221
Come on. What?

222
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,163
Well...

223
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:34,568
He touched me.

224
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,567
Over your shirt?

225
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,399
No!

226
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,067
Under it.

227
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,781
And what else?

228
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,044
It's personal.

229
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,610
Come on!

230
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:53,447
What?

231
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,583
He fingered me.

232
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:01,389
You wanted him to?
Sure.

233
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:04,894
Did it hurt?

234
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:09,972
No. It was just... really nice. Really fun.

235
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:12,469
<i>When I watched her,</i>

236
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,236
<i>the burning spread from the plexus.</i>

237
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:19,474
<i>The burning burnt.
The sensation of traumatic.</i>

238
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,246
<i>It flashed on me</i>

239
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:27,615
<i>in bursts of clarity that it wasn't
her fault if she was she and I just me.</i>

240
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:32,390
<i>As those glimpses of truth hit me
like a thunderbolt,</i>

241
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,261
<i>I! Was myself I cursed.</i>

242
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:38,261
<i>And life became even harder.</i>

243
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:43,102
A literary revelation, here and in France,

244
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:47,175
the wildly talented young Quebecois
spews her loathing...

245
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,107
Stop!
Wait, wait!

246
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:53,673
Her novel is a litany
strewn with rhetorical flourishes.

247
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,842
Stop, it's unbearable!

248
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,751
Why does it say you're 26 on the cover?

249
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:02,852
I'm ashamed.

250
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:07,453
I wanted to be published
before I turned 30.

251
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,160
You lied about your age?
I'm so ashamed.

252
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,768
You're amazing.

253
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,497
Your book's great.

254
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:18,335
Thanks.

255
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:29,515
You? You're not drinking?

256
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:35,286
I'm pregnant.

257
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:43,995
Bravo.

258
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:45,123
Thanks.

259
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:32,176
Yes?
Mathieu? It's me.

260
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:35,416
<i>Hi, what time is it in Montréal?</i>

261
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:38,080
Late.

262
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:40,187
Early, actually.

263
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:42,750
I can't sleep.

264
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:45,588
<i>What's going on?</i>

265
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:48,359
Nothing.

266
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:58,207
<i>I'm happy to hear your voice.</i>

267
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:00,101
Memo.

268
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,642
How's the book doing?

269
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:07,909
<i>Incredibly well, as you know.</i>

270
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,218
How well?

271
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:13,487
Let me repeat it:

272
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:17,290
<i>We 're atop the fists in Quebec and France.</i>

273
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,327
<i>We've sold 30,000 copies.</i>

274
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:23,160
<i>We'll print a second run.</i>

275
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,269
Is that good?

276
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:32,500
<i>5,000</i> copies is a bestseller,
so <i>30,000</i> is better than good.

277
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:38,246
You're sure?
Yes, it's a hit.

278
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,683
I find it hard to believe.

279
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,022
We make a beautiful duo, babe!

280
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:03,096
He was happy?
Disgustingly happy!

281
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:08,003
That fat filthy rich
fucking shithole bastard.

282
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,339
One where's good, two's better!

283
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,506
Has fatso put on even more weight?

284
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:18,781
Probably. I try not
to look at those pigs.

285
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:21,288
Hand me my cash.

286
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:27,153
He always has you finish him.

287
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:31,290
No idea why. Count yourself lucky.
At least he's fast.

288
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,867
Exactly. You came, now beat it, man!

289
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:36,198
He insists on his full hour.

290
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:38,000
He's a businessman.

291
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:41,470
We put on a great show.
He keeps coming back.

292
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:44,378
You lick really well.

293
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:47,215
Yeah? I'm never sure what to do.

294
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:51,912
No, you're good. Your fingers, tongue.
Really not bad, no joke.

295
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:55,683
When I moaned it wasn't all an act.
Really?

296
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:59,488
If fatso wasn't there,
I think I'd come for real.

297
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,558
How 'bout another try?

298
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:04,522
Please, sweetie!

299
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:06,657
- Silly!
- C'mon, I'll pay you!

300
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:38,753
<i>It was a new world. I was captivated.</i>

301
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:41,419
<i>In my captivity,</i>

302
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,829
<i>I suffered like a martyr.</i>

303
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,600
<i>Something inside me broke.</i>

304
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:54,338
<i>Something ripped in two
like a tree trunk split by lightning.</i>

305
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,104
<i>I swear that at that moment,</i>

306
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:00,313
<i>I heard it crack in pain.</i>

307
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:16,189
<i>After our session last week</i> I <i>walked home.
It was dusk.</i>

308
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:24,298
A few streets from home
I saw a man laying bricks.

309
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:29,295
He was wearing a tank-top and work boots.

310
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:34,571
He was sweating.

311
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,404
His hair was filthy.

312
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:42,916
In fact, every inch of him was filthy.

313
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,885
I stopped beside him

314
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:53,322
and asked if he could take a short break

315
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,992
to fuck me in the alleyway

316
00:40:57,988 --> 00:40:59,558
right there.

317
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,794
He looked a bit surprised

318
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:06,569
but did what I wanted.

319
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:10,802
Exactly.

320
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,252
He followed me to the alley.

321
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,286
He hardly spoke.

322
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:25,625
Neither did I.

323
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:29,360
He took me by the neck

324
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:34,429
and pressed my face
against the damp bricks.

325
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:39,166
He reached under my skin

326
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:44,169
and stuck his fingers in my pussy.

327
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:55,981
I was dripping wet.

328
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,788
His whole hand was wet.

329
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,398
He was rough.

330
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:12,399
He never let go of my neck.

331
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,041
He pinned me there.

332
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:21,408
But I wanted to be pinned down.

333
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:27,887
He took his cock out of his jeans.

334
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,658
I felt it hard against my ass.

335
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:32,817
He fucked me,

336
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:35,421
fast and hard.

337
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:39,100
He smelled of sweat and wet cement,

338
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:41,998
a mixture of the two.

339
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:55,440
I could hear the sounds of the city.

340
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:58,077
Passers-by,

341
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:01,356
their banal conversation.

342
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:12,229
His cock pounded my pussy.

343
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:16,071
He moaned softly in my ear.

344
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:22,703
He came fast, on my thigh.

345
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:27,282
I felt perfect,

346
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,577
like in a daze.

347
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,613
I pulled up my panties and left.

348
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,893
I couldn't describe his face.

349
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:52,801
And what...

350
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58,305
How do you feel about it?

351
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,949
I needed to belong to someone.

352
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:09,117
I belong to those who take me.

353
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:22,329
What are you doing?

354
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,537
I don't want to talk anymore.

355
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,514
Let's be reasonable, OK?

356
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:46,791
I want you so badly.

357
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:57,501
And so do you.
My wife's right outside.

358
00:44:58,562 --> 00:44:59,870
I know.

359
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:06,478
No, stop it! Stop.

360
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,837
Pretty good waist.

361
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:43,415
Nice line of the hips.

362
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:49,223
<i>Your ass is just as</i> it <i>should be.</i>

363
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:52,791
The finest of the finest.

364
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:05,799
Your breasts are starting to sag a bit.

365
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:14,243
Legs, knees, belly...

366
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:17,049
No complaints.

367
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:24,255
You have everything you need
where you need it.

368
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:50,684
How have you been since last time?
Fine.

369
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:54,489
You haven't changed jobs?
No.

370
00:46:58,615 --> 00:47:00,617
How many clients do you see?

371
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:03,489
10 or 20 a week.

372
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:09,860
You always use protection, no matter what?

373
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:14,441
Yes.
For oral sex too?

374
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,372
Yes?

375
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:19,109
Not always.

376
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,114
You've never been treated
for an STD?

377
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:29,317
Are you pregnant?

378
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:37,563
Noticed any changes in
your health recently?

379
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:46,196
Alright, let's examine you.

380
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:49,334
Put this on, I'll be back.

381
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:56,142
<i>I prefer the biggest number.</i>

382
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,376
<i>The accumulation of clients,</i>

383
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:01,147
<i>professors,</i>

384
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:03,521
<i>doctors, psychoanalysis.</i>

385
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:05,684
<i>Each one has a specialty,</i>

386
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:09,925
<i>busying himself
with one part of me or another,</i>

387
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,829
<i>for the healthy development of the whole.</i>

388
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,164
<i>One man in my life would be dangerous;</i>

389
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:21,070
<i>Too much hatred in me for one head.</i>

390
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:24,337
<i>I need the planet,</i>

391
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:27,745
<i>the full range of humankind.</i>

392
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:09,540
<i>Since you didn't look a! Me,</i>

393
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,040
<i>I placed myself in your gaze.</i>

394
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:54,616
Hello.

395
00:51:57,581 --> 00:52:01,051
Thanks for agreeing to meet me.
My pleasure.

396
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,954
I'm a huge admirer.

397
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:08,258
Everyone at the magazine is.
Thank you.

398
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:12,601
A new novel,
you must be feeling the pressure.

399
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:15,099
Why'?

400
00:52:15,232 --> 00:52:20,443
Sales, reviews, nominations for Europe's
most prestigious literary awards...

401
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:23,249
You must dream of repeating that.

402
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:27,152
I'd prefer to have won the awards.

403
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:34,923
People buy my novel for my face
on the front cover.

404
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:37,022
But do they read it?

405
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:39,261
I don't know.

406
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:41,836
That's rather dark.

407
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:48,505
I feel like it's son of a mess.

408
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:53,039
The mess is pan of my vision of the world.

409
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,483
What do you mean?

410
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:01,856
There are too many watching.

411
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,661
Reflecting back my beauty or my ugliness,

412
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:08,854
my talent or my stupidity.

413
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:11,561
I am lost,

414
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:18,664
knowing people think things about me
over which I have no control...

415
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:20,297
It's very upsetting.

416
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:24,543
It's pan of the mess.

417
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:26,574
And what do they think?

418
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:29,681
I don't know.

419
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:32,681
I don't want to know.

420
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:39,489
Maybe I shouldn't have exposed myself.

421
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:45,692
I think I don't like
being exposed, in fact.

422
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:50,827
Now I keep a low profile.

423
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,508
Success must have calmed you down?

424
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:59,574
I lost something with that book.

425
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:03,508
I have the impression

426
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,747
somethings been soiled.

427
00:54:08,945 --> 00:54:11,221
I think it's starting to kick in.

428
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,530
I'm sorry.

429
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,535
Do you want to go on'?

430
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:27,133
What is your next novel about?

431
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:37,546
Mathieu?

432
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,756
What if my new book doesn't sell?

433
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:46,384
<i>Don't worry, it'll all go fine.</i>

434
00:54:47,417 --> 00:54:49,897
But if it doesn't, what'll we do?

435
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:54,958
<i>Well, nothing. What can we do?</i>

436
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:58,569
But if no one likes what I wrote?

437
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:04,441
<i>I like it. I'm here.</i>

438
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:06,979
<i>I'll be there, I always will.</i>

439
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:11,179
You won't abandon me?

440
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,249
<i>Never.</i>

441
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,182
And if the critics demolish me?

442
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:22,594
<i>First, critics demolish books,
they don't demolish you.</i>

443
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:26,764
You know it's the same thing.

444
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:28,597
<i>It won'! Happen.</i>

445
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:36,800
I can't breathe, Mathieu.

446
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:40,611
It's absolutely suffocating.

447
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:52,019
I missed you, Cynthia.

448
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:54,322
Memo.

449
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,790
You're really beautiful.

450
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:00,663
Thanks.

451
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:05,503
Am I your favorite john?

452
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:12,039
I think so. You're one of my best, yes.

453
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:18,675
Turn over, I want to take you from behind.

454
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,583
OK.

455
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:36,732
You're beautiful.

456
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:38,738
You're so beautiful!

457
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:44,509
I'll fuck you in the ass, OK?
No.

458
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,604
Come on, Cynthia.

459
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,547
I'll pay you extra.

460
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:51,879
I don't want to.

461
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,219
I'll give you $100 more.

462
00:56:58,348 --> 00:56:59,691
200.

463
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:04,527
OK.

464
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:08,263
Thank you.

465
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:13,969
I won't hurt you.

466
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:24,246
It's so good.

467
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,653
Tell me you like it.

468
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,054
Say it.

469
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:52,344
<i>Hello?
Where are you?</i>

470
00:57:53,736 --> 00:57:55,010
At home.

471
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:58,915
<i>What the fuck? Your first client
was at 8. He's mad.</i>

472
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:02,754
I'm sorry.

473
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,763
I think I want out.

474
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:19,869
<i>Ge! Some rest.</i>

475
00:58:21,197 --> 00:58:23,803
<i>I'M find a replacement
for you today.</i>

476
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:30,540
OK, no. I'll come.

477
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:31,947
<i>You sure?</i>

478
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,788
Yeah.

479
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:44,731
<i>I'd describe the beauty of the world
if! Could see it.</i>

480
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:50,196
<i>Write how faith and courage can overcome
the worst misfortunes.</i>

481
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:54,206
<i>Bu! I'm too busy dying.</i>

482
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:57,837
<i>We have to cut to the chase,</i>

483
00:58:58,635 --> 00:59:00,308
<i>to what's killing me.</i>

484
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:11,052
Good, it'll be simple. Come with me.

485
00:59:12,015 --> 00:59:14,518
Maybe my mouth too.

486
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:18,155
I'd like a mouth with more punch.

487
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:21,498
It's really not necessary.

488
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:23,331
That's kind.

489
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,833
But just a bit, OK?

490
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:27,837
Come.

491
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:36,884
It'll heal fast.

492
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:51,298
Can you stay with me tonight?

493
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:54,459
Yes.

494
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:18,650
Suzanne?

495
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:20,617
Yes?

496
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:27,299
The tragedy, when people love you,

497
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,495
is they can stop loving you

498
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:34,939
at any moment.

499
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:06,661
Hi, Patrick.

500
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:08,694
Hi.

501
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:11,396
I'm happy to meet you.
Me too.

502
01:02:49,132 --> 01:02:50,702
OK, you like it rough.

503
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:58,313
So do I.

504
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,117
Not too rough, OK?

505
01:03:09,152 --> 01:03:11,496
Don't speak. Don't speak.

506
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:35,918
That's so good.

507
01:03:59,202 --> 01:04:00,772
What are you doing?

508
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:02,178
Stop!

509
01:04:02,305 --> 01:04:03,682
Stop!

510
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:08,120
Don't scream.

511
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:32,506
Hello.
Hello.

512
01:04:32,635 --> 01:04:35,639
I have a delivery for you.
Sign here please.

513
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:42,583
Thank you.

514
01:04:45,982 --> 01:04:48,428
Are you alright, madame?
Sure.

515
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:53,156
I really like your work.
I'm a big admirer.

516
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:55,333
Thanks very much.

517
01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:59,998
Your first novel's still my favorite,
but I like all your books.

518
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:02,337
Thank you.

519
01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:04,373
Are you working on something?

520
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:07,009
Yeah.

521
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:09,539
Can't wait to read it.

522
01:05:12,174 --> 01:05:14,017
I have to find the ending.

523
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:16,685
OK.

524
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:18,786
Thank you.

525
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:21,789
Thanks.

526
01:05:49,412 --> 01:05:51,221
Aren't you coming?

527
01:05:54,317 --> 01:05:56,058
Who's that bitch?

528
01:05:59,655 --> 01:06:00,895
What?

529
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:06,973
Leave with that slut if you want.

530
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:11,945
What's going on?

531
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:15,439
We're waiting for you.

532
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,244
We're all having fun.

533
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:25,659
Don't touch me!

534
01:06:28,851 --> 01:06:30,831
OK, I don't get it.

535
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:33,694
I saw you with that fat cow!

536
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:37,464
I saw you!

537
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:42,966
You're fucking nuts.

538
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:44,872
I saw you!

539
01:06:48,938 --> 01:06:51,976
I saw you, shit!
How much have you drunk?

540
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:04,787
It's time to end it for real.

541
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:08,225
This isn't fun anymore.

542
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:51,874
What'll I do with her?

543
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,879
I don't know what to do with her.

544
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:04,725
I haven't found the ending.

545
01:08:06,882 --> 01:08:08,759
Will I have to kill her?

546
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:12,862
I can't really have to kill her.

547
01:08:14,957 --> 01:08:16,561
I'll have to kill them.

548
01:08:20,196 --> 01:08:24,269
<i>I'll make my death a poster
that will multiply on walls.</i>

549
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:28,248
<i>I'll die like you die on stage,</i>

550
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:31,548
<i>in a storm of emotion.</i>

551
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:54,741
<i>I expected that you'd still love me
or that you'd kill me.</i>

552
01:08:56,732 --> 01:08:58,473
<i>Because you are so great,</i>

553
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:01,738
<i>I expected something grandiose.</i>

554
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,767
<i>When death comes,</i>

555
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:31,042
<i>I don'! Wan! To be there.</i>

556
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:47,289
If you move,

557
01:09:49,151 --> 01:09:50,459
you're dead.

558
01:10:13,976 --> 01:10:16,582
What are you doing? I'm not finished.

559
01:10:23,752 --> 01:10:25,095
Crazy bitch!

560
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:55,623
<i>In the end what counts is the crash,</i>

561
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:57,925
<i>the place of my defeat,</i>

562
01:10:59,021 --> 01:11:02,696
<i>when chance gives way,
and the actions embodying me</i>

563
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:05,134
<i>finally have me on a leash,</i>

564
01:11:05,694 --> 01:11:07,970
<i>forcing me toward my end.</i>

565
01:11:09,398 --> 01:11:12,470
<i>I will lower my body into death,</i>

566
01:11:13,535 --> 01:11:15,947
<i>where my soul already lies.</i>

567
01:12:34,616 --> 01:12:36,789
You have to eat, miss.

568
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:38,887
You're thin as a coffin nail.

569
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:40,629
Go on!

570
01:12:58,307 --> 01:12:59,980
Mathieu...

571
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:16,868
Let's walk a bit.

572
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:32,074
Get me out of here.

573
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:34,049
Do you dislike it?

574
01:13:35,711 --> 01:13:38,521
Only the insane like being in an asylum.

575
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:41,853
It's not an asylum,

576
01:13:42,451 --> 01:13:44,089
it's a rest home.

577
01:13:44,887 --> 01:13:46,525
I've rested enough.

578
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:49,764
I feel better.

579
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:53,767
I'm happy to hear it. Really.

580
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:56,766
I'm not like them.

581
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:00,541
I'll truly go crazy if I stay.

582
01:14:02,871 --> 01:14:04,544
Get me out of here.

583
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:10,207
What are you doing?

584
01:16:13,869 --> 01:16:15,712
You saved my life.

585
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:32,390
What are you doing?

586
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:03,994
You saved my life.

587
01:17:53,802 --> 01:17:55,179
I missed you.

588
01:17:58,674 --> 01:17:59,948
Memo.

589
01:18:04,646 --> 01:18:06,626
We'll be good to each other.

590
01:18:09,785 --> 01:18:11,025
Yes.

591
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:17,162
I can't live without you.

592
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:22,667
Neither can I.

593
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:28,309
OK.

594
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:32,576
Now don't freak out.

595
01:18:36,411 --> 01:18:37,719
What is it?

596
01:18:41,149 --> 01:18:43,356
I want us to stay together.

597
01:18:45,087 --> 01:18:46,498
OK...

598
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,175
Will you marry me?

599
01:18:58,767 --> 01:18:59,871
What?

600
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:05,110
We can get engaged,
and get married next year and have kids.

601
01:19:06,208 --> 01:19:09,712
Ideally you'd be this pregnant
at the altar.

602
01:19:11,546 --> 01:19:13,253
You want to marry me?

603
01:19:14,049 --> 01:19:18,020
You're crazy!
I know. I don't understand.

604
01:19:19,354 --> 01:19:20,958
I want us to be together.

605
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:25,228
Come on, we've dicked around enough.

606
01:19:26,228 --> 01:19:27,571
Will you say yes?

607
01:19:29,898 --> 01:19:30,898
Yes.

608
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:32,099
Yes?

609
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:12,946
<i>Mathieu? It's me.
I'm happy to hear your voice.</i>

610
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:15,076
<i>You got home alright?
Yes.</i>

611
01:20:16,077 --> 01:20:17,283
<i>I'm writing.</i>

612
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:21,788
<i>That's great. Are you happy?
Yes.</i>

613
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:24,796
<i>I'm writing as I, with strong emotions.</i>

614
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:26,695
<i>I'm on track, I feel ii.</i>

615
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:28,824
<i>I'm working fast.</i>

616
01:20:29,124 --> 01:20:30,467
<i>That's extraordinary.</i>

617
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:33,204
<i>I'm so happy.
When can I read it?</i>

618
01:20:33,361 --> 01:20:36,103
<i>I should have a first draft
in 6 months.</i>

619
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:45,109
As soon as we're married, we'll stop. OK?
Yeah.

620
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:53,549
You have some there.

621
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:01,326
Come, come, come.

622
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:12,812
We'll be OK, right?

623
01:21:14,236 --> 01:21:16,307
Yeah.
OK.

624
01:21:18,974 --> 01:21:21,750
Should we invite some people over?
Sure.

625
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:24,087
Is that all we have?

626
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:27,023
Fuck, did you sneak some?

627
01:21:27,682 --> 01:21:28,682
Course not.

628
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:32,027
I'm sure you had more than me.
It's almost gone.

629
01:21:34,155 --> 01:21:36,999
Like when you shared our coke
with that slut.

630
01:21:37,092 --> 01:21:38,662
Fred's new girlfriend.

631
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:41,434
It was a party. Everybody shares.

632
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:43,042
What are you doing?

633
01:21:43,865 --> 01:21:47,438
We can order more or go out for some.
Chill!

634
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:49,014
What's your problem?

635
01:21:50,438 --> 01:21:51,940
Why'd you take it all?

636
01:21:52,607 --> 01:21:54,712
There are two of us, we share.

637
01:21:56,011 --> 01:21:57,011
Fucking junkie!

638
01:21:58,847 --> 01:22:00,520
You're the fucking junkie.

639
01:22:00,615 --> 01:22:03,425
The fucking whore and the fucking junkie.

640
01:22:07,889 --> 01:22:10,392
Don't you ever push me again.

641
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:14,365
Christ, you're a cunt!

642
01:22:16,731 --> 01:22:18,267
Christ, you're a dick!

643
01:23:05,947 --> 01:23:07,756
Hello.
Hi.

644
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:09,651
Am I too early?

645
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:13,132
No, I was expecting you. Come in.

646
01:23:13,254 --> 01:23:14,460
Thanks.

647
01:23:15,357 --> 01:23:18,270
Thanks for seeing me.
You're welcome.

648
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,833
We're eager to read your novel.

649
01:23:22,364 --> 01:23:24,105
Can you describe it?

650
01:23:28,803 --> 01:23:31,283
I can say that I write with passion.

651
01:23:33,108 --> 01:23:34,314
Good.

652
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:39,716
You've never matched your early success.
How do you live with that?

653
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:43,060
What?

654
01:23:44,452 --> 01:23:46,955
Maybe I'm wrong, but I read that

655
01:23:47,055 --> 01:23:51,470
your latest novels sold a tenth
as many copies as the first one

656
01:23:52,327 --> 01:23:53,965
in France and Quebec.

657
01:23:56,831 --> 01:23:58,640
Yes, that's possible.

658
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:13,189
Are you alright? Should we postpone this?

659
01:24:15,417 --> 01:24:16,760
No, that's fine.

660
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:28,508
From day one, people wanted to know
if what you write is true,

661
01:24:29,731 --> 01:24:32,211
if your books are autobiographical.

662
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:36,372
People lack imagination.

663
01:24:38,373 --> 01:24:39,579
That's true.

664
01:24:43,378 --> 01:24:46,188
Like in that magnificent passage...

665
01:24:46,514 --> 01:24:50,087
A prostitute jumps from the 20th floor

666
01:24:50,185 --> 01:24:52,563
to escape a dangerous client.

667
01:24:55,957 --> 01:24:57,561
Did I write that?

668
01:25:00,361 --> 01:25:01,567
Yes.

669
01:27:33,448 --> 01:27:37,260
<i>Once upon a time there was a tavern</i>

670
01:27:39,954 --> 01:27:43,766
<i>Where we used to raise a glass or two</i>

671
01:27:47,629 --> 01:27:53,307
<i>Remember how we laughed away the hours</i>

672
01:27:54,636 --> 01:27:59,642
<i>And dreamed of all the
great things we would do</i>

673
01:28:03,544 --> 01:28:10,826
<i>Those were the days, my friend</i>

674
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:14,126
<i>We though! They'd never end</i>

675
01:28:14,489 --> 01:28:20,064
<i>We'd sing and dance, forever and a day</i>

676
01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:25,570
<i>We'd live the life we choose</i>

677
01:28:25,933 --> 01:28:28,812
<i>We'd fight and never lose</i>

678
01:28:29,237 --> 01:28:31,183
For we were young

679
01:28:33,474 --> 01:28:36,148
<i>and sure to have our way</i>

680
01:30:35,396 --> 01:30:38,070
<i>I haven'! Confessed for many years.</i>

681
01:30:40,468 --> 01:30:43,108
<i>I'm no! Exactly sure what to do.</i>

682
01:30:46,107 --> 01:30:48,417
I've done many stupid things.

683
01:30:50,211 --> 01:30:53,124
I'm too ashamed to tell you the details.

684
01:31:00,321 --> 01:31:01,823
I have the feeling...

685
01:31:04,425 --> 01:31:06,427
that everything is killing me.

686
01:31:09,597 --> 01:31:11,338
Words kill me.

687
01:31:15,236 --> 01:31:18,445
For a while I thought writing would save me

688
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:23,354
but writing took chunks out of me.

689
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:30,489
Writing brings you too close to death.

690
01:31:36,023 --> 01:31:38,936
I invented Nelly to protect Isabelle,

691
01:31:41,762 --> 01:31:44,333
but I think the opposite happened.

692
01:31:48,803 --> 01:31:51,374
I did things to write about them.

693
01:31:54,775 --> 01:31:56,482
I shouldn't have.

694
01:32:03,818 --> 01:32:06,196
<i>Love kills me too.</i>

695
01:32:09,457 --> 01:32:11,232
<i>Sex kills me.</i>

696
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:15,404
<i>Beauty, ugliness,</i>

697
01:32:16,831 --> 01:32:18,174
<i>success,</i>

698
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:20,812
<i>failure...</i>

699
01:32:24,739 --> 01:32:27,652
<i>I feel myself dying in everything I do.</i>

700
01:32:44,992 --> 01:32:47,836
<i>Bu! Now I'd like to move on.</i>

701
01:32:58,506 --> 01:33:00,713
I'd <i>like</i> to feel better.

702
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:15,317
Isabelle Fortier ended her life
on 24 September 2009 at the age of 36.

703
01:34:15,416 --> 01:34:17,828
She published four novels,
one posthumously.

704
01:34:20,821 --> 01:34:23,821
We sincerely thank her family,
friends and all those who loved her.
