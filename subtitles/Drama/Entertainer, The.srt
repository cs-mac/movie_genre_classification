00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,470
[Episode 17]

2
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:45,728
Hyung, sign here.

3
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:48,118
I am more like an uncle.
What do you mean "hyung"?

4
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:50,828
Okey, Jo Ha Neul.

5
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:53,069
Sin Seok Ho...

6
00:00:53,669 --> 00:00:56,428
Here! The contracts...

7
00:00:56,429 --> 00:00:59,398
I will try to make your younger
brother to become a singer.

8
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:00,928
Aigoo, thank you.

9
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:04,789
But, it worries me that he hasn't even
graduated from elementary school yet.

10
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:07,729
Seong Hyeon.

11
00:01:09,179 --> 00:01:12,219
I'm very late keeping my promise, aren't I?

12
00:01:14,309 --> 00:01:16,589
Now it's my turn.

13
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:23,619
I will return the song which I stole.

14
00:01:34,279 --> 00:01:37,588
I said I looked forward to taking you
to the airport. Let's go in my car.

15
00:01:37,589 --> 00:01:40,228
I called a taxi. That's
too much to ask of you.

16
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:43,658
I should have contacted you in
advance and I came so late.

17
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:45,858
Let's say our farewell here.

18
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:51,318
Thanks to you I have literally
laid down ten years

19
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:55,018
I should take care of whatever
complication remains.

20
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:57,548
Thank you for taking such a huge step.

21
00:01:57,549 --> 00:01:59,738
I also learned a lot.

22
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:03,509
Now I am in the same spot.

23
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:07,228
The taxi is waiting.

24
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:10,658
If you are in Australia later, contact me.
We'll have a drink.

25
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:12,499
- All right.
- Then.

26
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:34,368
I don't think I can forget this for a
very long, long, long, and long time.

27
00:02:34,369 --> 00:02:36,018
Ha Neul was so cool!

28
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:37,048
How about Hyung Seok Ho?

29
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:38,458
CEO worked very hard for it.

30
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:39,678
Everyone, thank you so much.

31
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:42,148
It was very hard for me to keep my
tears away while playing the bass.

32
00:02:42,149 --> 00:02:45,498
Hey, but where did CEO go? I bet
he's crying alone somewhere.

33
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,399
He said he wanted to say
good bye to Choi Joon Ha.

34
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:05,319
I enjoyed watching the performance.

35
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,509
It was good.

36
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:11,009
Yes, it was good.

37
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:13,899
You are saying as if it's
someone else's stage.

38
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:16,648
Why did you want to see me? Ah!

39
00:03:16,649 --> 00:03:19,599
I will start looking into the
overseas study thing soon.

40
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,159
Before I leave,

41
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:25,819
I should also return it.

42
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:32,359
I gained confidence on

43
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:36,149
how I should live my life

44
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:39,989
while watching you and Choi Joon Ha.

45
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:45,469
I will obey your words,

46
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:49,259
and return "Don't Touch".

47
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:02,909
You may never be able to perform again.

48
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:11,239
Well, wouldn't it be hard for me to go on a
stage anyway? With this guilt inside me.

49
00:04:13,059 --> 00:04:18,119
You have a bigger problem.
I looked into it,

50
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:22,419
and both of us may get arrested.

51
00:04:23,309 --> 00:04:25,688
What will happen to the Entertainer Band?

52
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:27,539
I don't know.

53
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,579
What should I do?

54
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:53,068
CEO Sin, are you feeling sick?

55
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:56,189
Did you get diagnosed with something bad?

56
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:01,918
I lose some weight, but I don't
think it will affect my health.

57
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,878
Then, why would you propose
something like that?

58
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:06,938
I'm joking, but unless
you are terminally ill,

59
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,898
there's no way that you would.

60
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:13,748
Now's the end of hardship, and the
start of success for Entertainer Band.

61
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:15,328
So, why would you throw out?

62
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:17,619
What do you mean I'm throwing out?

63
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:21,929
I just want them to grow big under a
company with professional system.

64
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,419
Then Mango can just merge
under our Wild Company.

65
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:35,369
I may have to vacate my
position for a long time.

66
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:40,559
Wow, you keep saying weird stuff today.

67
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:16,889
What did you say? Turning yourself in?

68
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:24,599
You should have discussed it with me.
What were you thinking?

69
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:29,098
If I did discuss this with you, then what?
"Okay! That sounds good. Let's confess.

70
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:31,149
Is that what you would have said?

71
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:40,068
And the investigation? How
will it be conducted?

72
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:45,188
If they can contact composer Jang Min Soo's
family, they should be calling me in again.

73
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:48,478
They can't seem to reach
his younger sibling.

74
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,579
I guess the only thing
lacking is my confession.

75
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:54,809
And if they can prove the facts,

76
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,068
Will... you be going into the prison?

77
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:03,778
Prison term up to 1 year or a
fine under 10 million Won.

78
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:07,048
Let's prepare the fine. Ten million
Won isn't that hard to get.

79
00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:09,708
Don't. I won't pay the fine.

80
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:12,728
Even if Ten million won falls
from the sky, I won't pay.

81
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:14,628
I should go to prison.

82
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:17,339
Do you think jail cell and
prison is your playground?

83
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:40,129
Min Joo,

84
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:47,279
How can Ten Million won
replace someone's life?

85
00:07:48,859 --> 00:07:54,249
Even if I get released from prison after 1
year, can that replace a person's life?

86
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:02,719
I, will gladly receive any
punishment given to me.

87
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:10,119
Also, it's already decided
our Entertainer Band

88
00:08:12,109 --> 00:08:15,129
will join Wild Company

89
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:19,608
I am sure you and Green
can manage well together,

90
00:08:19,609 --> 00:08:22,548
but I thought it would be better for
the kids to be in a bigger company.

91
00:08:22,549 --> 00:08:27,588
Let's worry about you before the kids.

92
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:30,079
After you are done with
the prison sentence,

93
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:33,208
how will you feed yourself?

94
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:37,128
You need to keep Mango alive. How
could you close the door on it?

95
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:39,529
Because I am not confident.

96
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:49,379
<i>"You can cry"</i>

97
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:53,899
Hyung, how was our performance?

98
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:58,358
I will be singing until I die,

99
00:08:58,359 --> 00:09:04,389
but I don't think there will be anymore good
performances compared to the one that you and I had.

100
00:09:12,349 --> 00:09:14,838
CEO wants to have lunch with everyone.
Let's go.

101
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:17,539
Okay, I will be right there.

102
00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:48,108
It's delicious.

103
00:09:48,109 --> 00:09:50,759
Tastes more delicious
since it's been awhile.

104
00:09:55,939 --> 00:09:57,569
Oh, right!

105
00:09:57,989 --> 00:10:02,229
You guys... ever heard of this
big company called Wild Company?

106
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:06,608
Well, that company is a very
big talent management company.

107
00:10:06,609 --> 00:10:09,758
There are many singers, and actors.

108
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:11,319
Why are you talking about that company?

109
00:10:12,989 --> 00:10:15,138
I think it's time for Entertainer

110
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:18,045
to move up to step 2.

111
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:19,838
We had a meeting

112
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,038
the general feeling towards our band
'Entertainer' seems to be incredibly fond.

113
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:28,545
So let's make Entertainer a bit wilder and work,
no longer with Mango, but with Wild Company.

114
00:10:28,569 --> 00:10:31,198
Japan, China, South East Asia. Even
entering into the hallyu wave.

115
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:32,965
I like it the way it is, though.

116
00:10:32,989 --> 00:10:35,919
If we all work hard too, we can
just become such a company.

117
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:39,315
That's right. Let's eat
diligently and do our best!

118
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:42,285
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

119
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,705
No. You're saying this
because you don't know.

120
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:46,758
Mango is at the Level of a
neighborhood corner shop.

121
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:50,969
At an average sized company around 100
people are employed to work on one newbie.

122
00:10:50,979 --> 00:10:52,908
But we're saying we like it this way.

123
00:10:52,909 --> 00:10:55,668
I mean... if you open your mind a bit...

124
00:10:55,669 --> 00:10:57,848
Let's try to think about
this cool-headedly.

125
00:10:57,849 --> 00:11:00,648
At Wild Company, they have separate
people in charge for music,

126
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:02,478
dramas, CFs, overseas business.
They're methodically...

127
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:04,609
Why are you like this suddenly?

128
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,029
I...

129
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:16,429
I...

130
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:21,959
Because going on being the head
of Entertainer's Company...

131
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:24,929
I don't have the right to do that.

132
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:34,969
No. For someone to have taken a
light promise from 11 years ago,

133
00:11:34,979 --> 00:11:39,449
into an ideal stage. You're
saying has no right?

134
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:41,879
What the hell does not having the right?

135
00:11:42,939 --> 00:11:44,689
I know right.

136
00:11:45,969 --> 00:11:50,379
Be it me or Lee Joon Seok, we're
exactly the same kind of people.

137
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,078
But, how can you say something like that?

138
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,249
What does that guy have in common with you?

139
00:11:58,729 --> 00:12:00,489
You see...

140
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:04,479
while doing this job,

141
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:07,248
no matter how drunk I'd be,

142
00:12:07,249 --> 00:12:10,359
I'd call a substitute
driver or take a taxi.

143
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:12,919
I would never drive.

144
00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:17,015
Director, why are you talking
about drunk driving now?

145
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:19,019
But that day...

146
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:23,309
the reason I took the wheel...

147
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:30,529
That day,

148
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,489
An unknown composer committed suicide.

149
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,909
Jackson's 'Don't touch'.

150
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:47,299
It wasn't Jinu's song but his.

151
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:54,899
I took it from him. That song.

152
00:12:56,149 --> 00:13:01,759
I only gave cold-hearted words to
that pleading poor unknown composer.

153
00:13:04,249 --> 00:13:07,069
That's why he killed himself that day.

154
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:12,428
And, while only thinking that I
had to go to the funeral home,

155
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:16,179
I grabbed the wheel and
got into an accident.

156
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:19,649
I got arrested.

157
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:24,649
And I couldn't protect Jackson.

158
00:13:25,699 --> 00:13:30,385
Having done that, what right could I have

159
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:34,049
to work any longer with
such nice guys as you?

160
00:13:36,169 --> 00:13:40,429
I'm turning myself in.

161
00:13:43,319 --> 00:13:46,828
If they investigate I'll probably...

162
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:49,209
be taken into custody, won't I?

163
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:54,078
The police are looking for
the composer's family

164
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,819
and if they can find them, the
Investigation will be conducted.

165
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:00,798
That's why...

166
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:05,239
I can't be here with you. So...

167
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:07,535
Let's go to a better company.

168
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:10,509
And have Entertainer work
even more successfully.

169
00:14:11,219 --> 00:14:13,218
Your pizza's here.

170
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:16,039
Yes, thank you. Here you go, Yeon Soo.

171
00:14:16,049 --> 00:14:19,995
Take this and give it Chan Hee. It's about time
you pick him up from kindergartenm isn't it?

172
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:21,669
Let's go.

173
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:25,789
What are you doing? Get up.

174
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:33,069
What's up with your expression?
Am I emigrating or something?

175
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:37,215
You guys have to go to a big
company and earn lots of money

176
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:40,079
so that later on you can
give me an allowance.

177
00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:47,128

You're very tired, aren't you?

197
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,929
I can look through it myself.

198
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:27,759
Seok Ho. After your parents,

199
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:31,085
I thought I was the one who
knew you the best, you know?

200
00:16:31,109 --> 00:16:32,949
That's probably true.

201
00:16:34,049 --> 00:16:36,789
Lately, seeing you changing,

202
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:40,209
- I don't think that's true anymore.
- Who's changing?

203
00:16:40,219 --> 00:16:43,929
You're still cleaning after the
screw ups barely getting by.

204
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:50,739
Yes. This is Sin Seok Ho.

205
00:16:52,189 --> 00:16:55,729
Yes. Yes.

206
00:16:57,069 --> 00:17:01,819
Yes. I understand. I'm leaving right now.

207
00:17:02,669 --> 00:17:05,548
- What is it?
- They got into contact

208
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:09,225
with the composer, Jang Min Soo's, family.
I'll be back.

209
00:17:09,249 --> 00:17:13,459
- Let's go together.
- If you go you're only going to cry the whole time.

210
00:17:16,029 --> 00:17:17,979
It's okay.

211
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:22,919
I'll go alone. And sort
out my thoughts a bit.

212
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,119
Please make sure the kids
aren't too shaken up.

213
00:18:06,609 --> 00:18:09,389
Oh, you came. Sit down.

214
00:18:19,479 --> 00:18:23,099
You're Jang Min Soo's brother, Jang Ji Soo.
Is that right?

215
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:26,598
Because of the copyright theft regarding Jang
Min Soo, Sin Seok Ho has turned himself in.

216
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:28,999
So I needed to verify the facts.

217
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:33,809
The song Jang Min Soo composed was
taken from him by Sin Seok Ho here.

218
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:37,138
And well... after that,

219
00:18:37,139 --> 00:18:40,718
he even committed suicide. Is that correct?

220
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,539
I'm not sure.

221
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:46,019
You would have to say it precisely.

222
00:18:47,189 --> 00:18:49,669
There's nothing I know precisely.

223
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:54,819
Excuse me. What do you mean...?

224
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:57,749
- Last year, you came to find me in my office and...
- My brother,

225
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:01,439
it is true that he passed away.
But the reason...

226
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,869
I don't know. There's
no suicide note either.

227
00:19:06,889 --> 00:19:11,658
I'm busy trying to live my life, why did you make me
come all the way here over something so unpleasant?

228
00:19:11,659 --> 00:19:14,589
But you came with that song.

229
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:19,219
I mean, you came to my office asking
me why I killed your brother.

230
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:23,299
Don't call me with another's
sad family history ever again.

231
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:26,909
I came because you said I had to come once.

232
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:29,879
If I come down here once,
my daily payment goes away.

233
00:19:29,889 --> 00:19:33,478
Making a living is already difficult so please don't
call me out again for something so pointless.

234
00:19:33,479 --> 00:19:35,859
Does that mean you're not going

235
00:19:35,869 --> 00:19:39,549
to sue over the Jang Min Soo matter?
If that's the case...

236
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:44,389
I have nothing to sue anyone over. I...

237
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:47,329
don't know this person.

238
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:53,258
What's going on?

239
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:55,859
Excuse me for a second.

240
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,739
You said that you don't know me?
But you do.

241
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:05,775
You know what I did to your brother.

242
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:07,899
Do you really want to
go to prison that much?

243
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:12,748
- I don't want to go.
- Why would you get punished? I should be the one.

244
00:20:12,749 --> 00:20:15,718
I came all the way from Sokcho.

245
00:20:15,719 --> 00:20:20,579
I can't go back today anyway.
Buy me some alcohol at least.

246
00:20:52,869 --> 00:20:59,889
I.. am the guy who killed Songwriter
Jang Min-Soo, your big brother

247
00:21:00,949 --> 00:21:04,519
I even turned myself in, why
did you say you don't know?

248
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:10,968
You came to find me after listening to "Don't Touch".
You know everything, but why are you like this?

249
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:15,519
You should forever remember
what you did wrong,

250
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:21,428
since I will remember what I did wrong.

251
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:23,608
Things like other people's lives

252
00:21:23,609 --> 00:21:28,609
I'm the man who stole the song that was his one
hope in life and made him leave this world.

253
00:21:29,349 --> 00:21:34,259
I am not the guy you should be
sitting and drinking soju with.

254
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:41,529
Not only could he not raise me well,

255
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:47,299
even falling to malnutrition,
our father's poverty,

256
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:51,759
probably pushed him once.

257
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:58,029
A man doing music has no future,

258
00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:02,728
the woman that left him was another push.

259
00:22:02,729 --> 00:22:08,869
No. It wasn't like that. They were getting
married after releasing the song.

260
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:15,789
It was my brother's wish.

261
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:21,619
He broke up with that
woman over a year ago.

262
00:22:23,899 --> 00:22:26,379
The day my brother died,

263
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:30,679
he said he was too tired and lonely,

264
00:22:31,969 --> 00:22:36,558
and asked to have a drink
with me in that situation,

265
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:42,179
but I told him it's difficult for me working hard
to make a living and let's meet another time.

266
00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:45,579
I pushed it back once more.

267
00:22:47,089 --> 00:22:52,349
To a person on the edge of life and
death, you pushed him even further.

268
00:22:54,069 --> 00:22:56,288
Who should be getting punished then?

269
00:22:56,289 --> 00:22:58,719
Even so, nothing changes.

270
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:04,768
If you're done drinking, get up and go to the police
station again, and tell them what exactly happened.

271
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:08,819
- I made Songwriter Jang Min-Soo commit suicide...
- I told you to shut up!

272
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:15,698
After my brother passed away like
that, my father couldn't even get up.

273
00:23:15,699 --> 00:23:19,638
Now, he is finally able to live on. If
my brother's incident breaks out again,

274
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:23,058
and he falls down again, he won't
be able to get back up this time.

275
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:26,059
Why is everyone so selfish!

276
00:23:27,209 --> 00:23:31,638
Even if you go rot in the prison, do
you think I would feel much better?

277
00:23:31,639 --> 00:23:33,948
And would our father feel much better?

278
00:23:33,949 --> 00:23:39,419
Just to make yourself
feel comfortable, you...

279
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:44,579
Why did you tear open the healing wound?

280
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,759
Then what should I do?

281
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:54,278
Your brother cannot even come back to life,

282
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:58,839
Just... I just wanted to write his
name and return him his things.

283
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:03,628
I should get punished.

284
00:24:03,629 --> 00:24:06,488
If I have to live the rest of my
life in prison, then I should.

285
00:24:06,489 --> 00:24:11,028
The person is gone. The
person is dead, gone now.

286
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:17,039
Just live with that memory
for the rest of your live.

287
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:24,769
Live as though a thorn is stuck
painfully in your heart.

288
00:24:27,089 --> 00:24:29,209
I live like that.

289
00:24:34,269 --> 00:24:36,348
I drank well.

290
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,779
Excuse me!

291
00:24:42,829 --> 00:24:47,419
I enjoyed that stage.

292
00:24:49,429 --> 00:24:52,059
That dead man,

293
00:24:53,509 --> 00:24:55,769
just like my brother,

294
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:59,589

Why am I like this, right?

326
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:07,008
Why is the man so drunk when he
is supposed to be in the prison.

327
00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:11,408
Tell me about it tomorrow. Man Sik Hyung
said he will come to the office tomorrow.

328

Why did you call him over?

Okay, let's go to the second round.
If Hyung comes, he can come along.

Hey, you were groaning in your sleep
last night. Did you hurt your back?

347
00:29:39,139 --> 00:29:41,378
No, did I not sleep well?

348
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:46,088
What happened to CEO? Is he
still in the police station?

349
00:29:46,089 --> 00:29:48,288
He will be sleeping at home well.

350
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:50,208
You got a call from CEO?

351

He is not getting sued, right?

352
00:29:52,699 --> 00:29:56,988
I don't know the details, but he was really
drunk last night, and I took him home.

353
00:29:56,989 --> 00:29:58,658
Wait he is drunk?

354
00:29:58,659 --> 00:30:02,499
This is the first time I
heard CEO drank alcohol.

355
00:30:03,229 --> 00:30:06,638
- The other side they will not sue.
- What?

356
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:10,478
So we don't need to go to
that Wild place then?!

357
00:30:10,479 --> 00:30:13,829
Of course.

358
00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:16,919
Eat! Eat!

359
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:34,178
Ah...

360
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:35,848
I'm dying here.

361
00:30:35,849 --> 00:30:37,358
How much did you drink?

362
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:39,128
I haven't drank in awhile. It's killing me.

363
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:42,358
Who did you drink with?
Anything going on with you?

364
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:44,529
What did the people from
police department say?

365
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:48,329
-Police department?-Police department?

366
00:30:52,849 --> 00:30:54,969
-Hello.-Hi.

367
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:01,598
CEO, aren't you feeling sick? I knew it.

368
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:03,148
Drink some of this. It'll help you relax.

369
00:31:03,149 --> 00:31:05,859
I already ate something. I am fine.

370
00:31:07,259 --> 00:31:09,828
Why did you go to the police department?

371
00:31:09,829 --> 00:31:12,028
Not now... later.

372
00:31:12,029 --> 00:31:14,248
I will explain later. How are the kids?

373
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:16,478
They are at home.

374
00:31:16,479 --> 00:31:19,868
Come to Wild Company by 6 o'clock evening.
I will also be there.

375
00:31:19,869 --> 00:31:21,088
CEO!

376
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:23,879
Ah, I should go to sauna today.

377
00:31:25,329 --> 00:31:28,148
-Aigoo...

378
00:31:28,149 --> 00:31:30,419
Ah, really.

379
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:40,468
You should eat something
before sauna to sober up.

380
00:31:40,469 --> 00:31:42,939
It really does help me sober up.

381
00:31:45,099 --> 00:31:48,259
I don't really see anything good
with the composer incident.

382
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:52,068
The world is so cruel.

383
00:31:52,069 --> 00:31:56,028
But, everything is solved, so why do the
kids have to move to another company?

384
00:31:56,029 --> 00:32:00,759
The kids, they are too good
to be growing under me.

385
00:32:09,049 --> 00:32:11,928
I think there's a traffic jam.

386
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:14,948
Gangnam is very heavy on
traffic at this hour.

387
00:32:14,949 --> 00:32:17,698
It's okey. They should be arriving soon.

388
00:32:17,699 --> 00:32:21,149
I will call and see how close they are.

389
00:32:25,129 --> 00:32:26,188
Hey, where are you at?

390
00:32:26,189 --> 00:32:28,178
We are still at the house.

391
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:29,799
What?

392
00:32:31,229 --> 00:32:33,948
What were you guys doing
all this time at home?

393
00:32:33,949 --> 00:32:38,909
Well, the thing is... Nobody wants to go

394
00:32:48,829 --> 00:32:52,859
I am sorry, CEO. Seems
like the kids are nervous.

395
00:32:56,549 --> 00:33:00,828
They must really like you, CEO Sin.

396
00:33:00,829 --> 00:33:02,988
No, it's nothing like that.

397
00:33:02,989 --> 00:33:07,609
I will, uh... arrange the meeting again.
I am sorry.

398
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,078
Everyone! Gather at the office immediately.

399
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,169
<i>End of call</i>

400
00:33:35,439 --> 00:33:37,159
What are you guys, huh?

401
00:33:38,459 --> 00:33:40,658
Ah, really...

402
00:33:40,659 --> 00:33:45,988
CEO Choi is a very busy person. I worked hard to
get his time for a meeting, and you guys waste it?

403
00:33:45,989 --> 00:33:47,558
What a bad first impression this is!

404
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:50,278
We don't need to meet him anymore, so
what good is the first impression?

405
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,139
What?

406
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:55,168
Right! Let's sit first, CEO. Sit. Sit

407
00:33:55,169 --> 00:33:56,998
Everyone sit. Sit. Sit around quickly.

408
00:33:56,999 --> 00:33:59,749
Hyung, here. CEO, here.

409
00:34:00,509 --> 00:34:02,049
Ah...

410
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:05,298
I am not in a mood to joke around.

411
00:34:05,299 --> 00:34:09,898
Let's calm down. I have
some major announcement.

412
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:12,648
Now is not the time to converse.
Why would you talk about your...

413
00:34:12,649 --> 00:34:15,459
It's a story that will introduce
- develop - conclude Mango.

414
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:19,748
Everyone, prepare your hearts and listen.
You can cry.

415
00:34:19,749 --> 00:34:22,689
-That's the title of the song.-Shhh!

416
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:29,788
CEO, you said you want to send
us off to a better environment.

417
00:34:29,789 --> 00:34:35,368
I understood your intention. But,
that's same as throwing us out.

418
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:38,038
Hey, stop blabbering...

419
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:40,038
Firstly, listen to what I say.

420
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:43,439
Don't cut me off. I am serious.

421
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:50,359
Just because you think you
can't raise the child well...

422
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:57,609
Sending the child off to better parents to get
adopted... to grow up in a better environment...

423
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:02,448
From that child's perspective, he is
being thrown out, not being sent off.

424
00:35:02,449 --> 00:35:06,688
What? Why are you talking about adoption
all of a sudden? Snap into your sense!

425
00:35:06,689 --> 00:35:10,288
I can't tell whether they
are better parents or not!

426
00:35:10,289 --> 00:35:14,098
I don't even know my birth parents,
and I haven't even met them,

427
00:35:14,099 --> 00:35:18,829
so how will I know whether they are
better or worse than the new parents?

428
00:35:23,249 --> 00:35:30,539
I grew up happily with good mother
and father in a good environment.

429
00:35:31,449 --> 00:35:37,439
They supported me on things that I
liked, and I enrolled in Julliard.

430
00:35:39,919 --> 00:35:41,899
I am an adopted child.

431
00:35:48,549 --> 00:35:53,099
When I saw Yeon Soo, I
thought he was great.

432
00:35:54,299 --> 00:35:56,399
On the other hand,

433
00:35:58,269 --> 00:36:03,619
I kept wondering why my
real parents abandoned me.

434
00:36:06,869 --> 00:36:12,598
When I was adopted, I cried
so much that my father

435
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:17,749
wanted me to smile endlessly, and
gave me the name "Lee Bang Geul".

436
00:36:21,739 --> 00:36:29,629
I am not sure if this was a better
environment, but I am endlessly thinking

437
00:36:30,539 --> 00:36:33,998
and imagining how it would been
to live with my birth parents

438
00:36:33,999 --> 00:36:36,739
even if I were more poor and burdened.

439
00:36:39,929 --> 00:36:43,168
You are telling us to
go to a better company?

440
00:36:43,169 --> 00:36:47,569
What do you mean by better? How
would you measure that standard?

441
00:36:48,689 --> 00:36:50,969
And, who will be deciding on that?

442
00:37:01,269 --> 00:37:06,689
See? You guys need more tissue.
You can cry.

443
00:37:07,509 --> 00:37:09,478
The song title really

444
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:11,709
does sound familiar now.

445
00:37:16,029 --> 00:37:20,338
What is this. Nobody is crying?

446
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:23,648
I even announced my painful family history.

447
00:37:23,649 --> 00:37:25,718
Well, it is very tearful...

448
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:28,258
Why aren't the tears coming out?

449
00:37:28,259 --> 00:37:33,079
Don't say it. Do you guys think
that I am lying right now?

450
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:38,698
Hey, Noona! Don't you have to cry with me?
You were also adopted.

451
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:40,368
It's not really an adoption for me.

452
00:37:40,369 --> 00:37:43,768
I am still listed under my
mom and dad's family tree.

453
00:37:43,769 --> 00:37:46,018
They left to heaven, so Ha
Neul's parents raised me.

454
00:37:46,019 --> 00:37:47,458
What?

455
00:37:47,459 --> 00:37:48,918
What is this!

456
00:37:48,919 --> 00:37:53,958
I was super nice to you because I thought
you were adopted into Ha Neul's family.

457
00:37:53,959 --> 00:37:56,618
You were? To me?

458
00:37:56,619 --> 00:37:59,478
Anyway, Kyle is right.

459
00:37:59,479 --> 00:38:01,238
Are you really going to
abandon us like this?

460
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:05,068
Ha.. I am going crazy. I am not abandoning.

461
00:38:05,069 --> 00:38:09,498
If I leave my position for a long time,
Entertainment Band may tumble down from its place.

462
00:38:09,499 --> 00:38:12,988
How could you guys not understand
anything that I say as a group?

463
00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:15,558
CEO Sin, you are the one not
understanding anything.

464
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:18,358
We understood everything,
but why don't you notice?

465
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:21,368
We will work very hard, and
become bigger than Wild.

466
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:26,838
That's right. We... don't
want to take fast steps.

467
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:31,738
Even if it's slow and takes long
time, we want to go all together.

468
00:38:31,739 --> 00:38:34,309
With CEO Sin Seok Ho.

469
00:38:39,249 --> 00:38:45,358
We should go on a MT(Field
trip) to cheer up!

470
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,988
I haven't been to any since university.

471
00:38:47,989 --> 00:38:50,128
That sounds good!

472
00:38:50,129 --> 00:38:52,068
Daddy, we are going somewhere together?

473
00:38:52,069 --> 00:38:53,228
I hope we do.

474
00:38:53,229 --> 00:38:55,798
CEO Sin, you should let us have this.

475
00:38:55,799 --> 00:38:58,548
Everyone worked so hard to
climb over big mountains.

476
00:38:58,549 --> 00:38:59,888
Everyone's going, right?

477
00:38:59,889 --> 00:39:04,968
President Byeon, Man Sik
Hyung, and CEO Yeo.

478
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:07,999
What. You weren't going to let me come?

479
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:13,308
What are you guys doing? If you are not going to
Wild, you should go work hard and get some money!

480
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:15,008
Please, let's go!

481
00:39:15,009 --> 00:39:18,888
Where should we go? Sea? Valley? Or...

482
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:21,899
South East Asia?!

483
00:39:24,289 --> 00:39:25,618
Your back's feeling okey?

484
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:29,889
Go buy me some pain relieving patch.
It feels so heavy.

485
00:39:32,689 --> 00:39:35,698
The stock price is dropping down very fast.

486
00:39:35,699 --> 00:39:39,549
If this continues, there's a
possibility of delisting...

487
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:44,658
Get me meetings with
broadcasting station chiefs.

488
00:39:44,659 --> 00:39:49,258
Well, CEO. The broadcasting station
boycott is not the main issue here.

489
00:39:49,259 --> 00:39:53,858
The singers and talents that we represent are
preparing for a lawsuit to terminate their contracts.

490
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:55,268
What kind of crap talk is that?!

491
00:39:55,269 --> 00:39:59,869
They state that the company has done a
great damage to their public image...

492
00:40:12,339 --> 00:40:13,979
How is this place?

493
00:40:14,539 --> 00:40:17,618
It looks good. Oh, you can even have BBQ.

494
00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:20,658
I wonder where CEO would prefer.

495
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:22,419
I am fine with anywhere.

496
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:28,348
Ah! You were asking about CEO Sin.

497
00:40:28,349 --> 00:40:33,169
Not at all. Both of you guys.

498
00:40:37,649 --> 00:40:42,998
It reminds me. The pretty green umbrella that
doesn't really suit Seok Ho, is it from you, Green?

499
00:40:42,999 --> 00:40:48,419
Ah, that? He was walking home in rain
without umbrella, so I gave it to him.

500
00:40:52,549 --> 00:40:55,138
Isn't that too pretty for Seok Ho?

501
00:40:55,139 --> 00:40:58,368
He should just have some
dark, big umbrella.

502
00:40:58,369 --> 00:41:00,509
Yes. That would suit him.

503
00:41:08,219 --> 00:41:11,618
Oh, I almost forgot about the meeting.
I'll be back soon.

504
00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:13,509
Take care.

505
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:36,049
I don't even have car key, nor wallet.

506
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:39,659
I don't want to go back in again...

507
00:41:42,439 --> 00:41:44,429
Where are you heading to?

508
00:41:48,649 --> 00:41:50,228
Is there something wrong?

509
00:41:50,229 --> 00:41:53,259
No, something just went into my eyes...

510
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:57,899
Don't you need to go to the office? Go in.
I have to attend a business.

511
00:41:58,569 --> 00:42:03,179
You have no car keys, nor bag...
Where are you going?

512
00:42:06,139 --> 00:42:11,969
Are your shoes comfortable? It's really great
for walking; your shoes and the weather.

513
00:42:21,129 --> 00:42:23,019
Let's stop walking. My legs are hurting.

514
00:42:33,149 --> 00:42:34,989
Why were you crying?

515
00:42:39,579 --> 00:42:44,068
Last time, I cried like a baby in front
of you. It was embarrassing as a man.

516
00:42:44,069 --> 00:42:47,019
I told you everything
about why I was upset.

517
00:42:47,669 --> 00:42:49,909
Can't you also tell me?

518
00:42:51,089 --> 00:42:53,408
If you can keep a secret.

519
00:42:53,409 --> 00:42:55,709
I am not Kyle.

520
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:03,009
Where should I start?

521
00:43:04,129 --> 00:43:08,809
If I start from 10 years ago, there won't be
enough time even if we stay up all night.

522
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:11,839
Where should I start?

523
00:43:12,699 --> 00:43:14,889
This person named Sin Seok Ho...

524
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,039
You like CEO Sin.

525
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:20,858
It's funny, right?

526
00:43:20,859 --> 00:43:25,078
You guys haven known each other for
10 years. Why haven't you confessed?

527
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:27,069
Because he might run away.

528
00:43:27,799 --> 00:43:33,499
If I tell him "I like you", our
relationship will just become awkward.

529
00:43:34,189 --> 00:43:38,718
Even staying as friends, It'll
feel ambiguous. That's why.

530
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:40,968
So, why are you crying now all of a sudden?

531
00:43:40,969 --> 00:43:43,259
I learned that

532
00:43:46,469 --> 00:43:50,719
Seok Ho, that bastard
likes some other woman.

533
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:56,269
Tears came out, because
I was a little shocked.

534
00:43:58,939 --> 00:44:01,668
You'll keep the secret, right?

535
00:44:01,669 --> 00:44:08,259
Of course. But, that... I
don't think it's love.

536
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:15,129
Love is something that you
can't hide for that long.

537
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:21,059
If it's someone that you really love,
you can't withstand without confessing.

538
00:44:26,849 --> 00:44:29,029
I hate you.

539
00:44:30,019 --> 00:44:31,498
You are too cruel.

540
00:44:31,499 --> 00:44:33,979
It's direct (Baseball term
"fastball" is pronounced the same).

541
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:36,729
Love is direct (Baseball term
"fastball" is pronounced the same).

542
00:44:37,419 --> 00:44:41,558
My age is a bit too much to throw fastball.

543
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:45,258
35 is also a good age to start a new love.

544
00:44:45,259 --> 00:44:46,838
I am 34!

545
00:44:46,839 --> 00:44:49,938
Aren't you the same as CEO Sin?

546
00:44:49,939 --> 00:44:53,118
I lied, because I didn't
want to call him "Oppa".

547
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,438
If I knew that he's into young girls,
I should have just called him "Oppa".

548
00:44:57,439 --> 00:45:00,579
You are cuter than Green.

549
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:07,208
You seem to know more than me.

550
00:45:07,209 --> 00:45:12,168
Me? Not at all. I only know that

551
00:45:12,169 --> 00:45:14,858
CEO Yeo Min Joo is a very cool woman.

552
00:45:14,859 --> 00:45:17,568
Looks, career, and even her
background is so good that

553
00:45:17,569 --> 00:45:21,828
she really needs courage to throw a
fastball. I know about this much.

554
00:45:21,829 --> 00:45:23,949
Thanks for saying that.

555
00:45:27,409 --> 00:45:29,209
Let's head back in now.

556
00:45:31,289 --> 00:45:34,838
Your legs hurt, right? What can I do?

557
00:45:34,839 --> 00:45:37,988
I'll just walk. While walking again,

558
00:45:37,989 --> 00:45:40,948
I can rethink whether this
is friendship or love.

559
00:45:40,949 --> 00:45:45,658
♪ <i>Lend me your shoulder,
you must give me a hug</i> ♪

560
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:49,578
By the way, it'll be the end if someone takes
picture of us walking together.♪ <i>To Your Dream</i> ♪

561
00:45:49,579 --> 00:45:52,978
If that happens, I'll just tell them that it's a one-sided thing
from my end only. ♪ <i>Come here. Tell me. Only let me know.</i> ♪

562
00:45:52,979 --> 00:45:56,959
No way! Your fans will chew
me out.♪ <i>To Your Dream</i> ♪

563
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:04,939
♪ <i>I will forget the time upon me,
and I just want to be with you</i> ♪

564
00:46:05,819 --> 00:46:11,428
I am disappointed. You should have told me.
There's nothing wrong with being adopted.

565
00:46:11,429 --> 00:46:16,988
When I was in the US, it was fine, but
Korea has a difference stance on it.

566
00:46:16,989 --> 00:46:20,288
I didn't want people to look down on me.
That's why.

567
00:46:20,289 --> 00:46:23,708
- You must have been feeling
sad back then-When?

568
00:46:23,709 --> 00:46:28,468
Before I laid everything down and disappeared, I
said to you "Are you some director of an orphanage?"

569
00:46:28,469 --> 00:46:31,559
<i>Did I ask you to feed me?</i>

570
00:46:32,129 --> 00:46:34,429
<i>I just wanted to do music,</i>

571
00:46:35,899 --> 00:46:40,399
<i>but I got treated like an orphan.</i>I must
have had guilty conscience back then.

572
00:46:41,229 --> 00:46:45,748
I didn't even know what was going on, and I
said something about orphanage director...

573
00:46:45,749 --> 00:46:48,119
You must have been upset.

574
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:52,069
My life is like a boomerang.

575
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:57,878
Importantly, where are we going for the field trip? If we can't
go to South East Asia, we should go to Jeju Island at least.

576
00:46:57,879 --> 00:47:01,398
It is certain that both your birth
parents and adoption parents

577
00:47:01,399 --> 00:47:03,318
are very kind. That is for sure.

578
00:47:03,319 --> 00:47:06,828
How can you be this bright? Talking
about field trip all of a sudden?

579
00:47:06,829 --> 00:47:12,799
I need to succeed, CEO. My adopted parents are still
angry. Because I quit Juliard, and in a band now.

580
00:47:13,729 --> 00:47:18,569
- Let's become Hallyu. Starting with the
US.-I am so ready for the US market.

581
00:47:20,549 --> 00:47:24,048
Hello. This is Sin Seok Ho. Yes.

582
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:26,159
Yes?

583
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:31,669
Yup, of course.

584
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:35,028
- Don't do it-They are asking
us for a commercial. Why not?

585
00:47:35,029 --> 00:47:37,628
Going up on a stage is more important
to a band compared to a commercial.

586
00:47:37,629 --> 00:47:41,208
Hey! Then actors should only act.
Why would they shoot commercials?

587
00:47:41,209 --> 00:47:44,168
They sent in a proposal, and it suits our Yeon
Soo's image completely. How good is this?

588
00:47:44,169 --> 00:47:46,778
He can get money, and prepare
to send Chan Hee to school.

589
00:47:46,779 --> 00:47:49,109
But, why does it have to be...!

590
00:47:50,799 --> 00:47:55,838
Jae Oh Group's "WithMe" condominium commercial is
a jackpot. Why is our Min Joo acting like this?

591
00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:00,758
So, Why would you link Yeon Soo's goody
image with Jae Oh Group-like company?

592
00:48:00,759 --> 00:48:04,009
Aren't your opinions getting too
personal, Miss Yeo Min Joo?

593
00:48:05,479 --> 00:48:07,248
Ah, really!

594
00:48:07,249 --> 00:48:10,258
Oppa Seong Hyeon has four more
songs in Choi Joon Ha's album.

595
00:48:10,259 --> 00:48:12,958
CEO Yeo is asking to do
remake of those songs.

596
00:48:12,959 --> 00:48:15,298
Will Choi Joon Ha agree to that?

597
00:48:15,299 --> 00:48:17,168
He's the one who suggested it first.

598
00:48:17,169 --> 00:48:20,258
I need to discuss this
with Hyung Seok Ho first.

599
00:48:20,259 --> 00:48:25,448
I personally thought it'd be good if we
got my song and Hyung Man Sik's song

600
00:48:25,449 --> 00:48:27,588
and worked them together
to make a new song.

601
00:48:27,589 --> 00:48:28,858
Hi.

602
00:48:28,859 --> 00:48:30,418
Hello.

603
00:48:30,419 --> 00:48:34,738
Hey. Our Entertainer guys are
working hard late into the night!

604
00:48:34,739 --> 00:48:39,018
- Seeing the president in such a good mood makes me feel like
something good has happened.-Are we going to the South East?

605
00:48:39,019 --> 00:48:41,028
Man..! Shut it!

606
00:48:41,029 --> 00:48:45,189
Hey, we got another commercial deal.

607
00:48:47,089 --> 00:48:50,388
-Wow!-Wait, wait, wait! A beer ad?

608
00:48:50,389 --> 00:48:51,319
Condominium commercial!

609
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:55,608
A commercial for apartments! Wow! You have to have
a great impression to get an ad for apartments!

610
00:48:55,609 --> 00:48:59,658
As expected, our image really is appealing!

611
00:48:59,659 --> 00:49:03,568
This commercial didn't come
to the Entertainer Band,

612
00:49:03,569 --> 00:49:06,988
but to our Na Yeon Soo.

613
00:49:06,989 --> 00:49:07,979
What?

614
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,108
Wow. Awesome.

615
00:49:09,109 --> 00:49:14,048
Since people these days aren't able to take responsibility for young kids,
it's a world where unpleasant events are being talked about on the news.

616
00:49:14,049 --> 00:49:17,098
Na Yeon Soo, who has raised his son alone
and is making his dream come true,

617
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:20,578
has gotten a proposition saying his image
was suitable for the WithMe Apartments.

618
00:49:20,579 --> 00:49:24,628
Stop... With Me Apartments. JO group?

619
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:28,048
Ah, what is this! Hyung Yeon Soo, you're
not really dating President Yeo are you?

620
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:30,738
President Yeo supported you Hyung Yeon Soo!

621
00:49:30,739 --> 00:49:31,908
Again with that.. again.

622
00:49:31,909 --> 00:49:37,208
It's not like that. How could I with a
person like that... Don't be ridiculous.

623
00:49:37,209 --> 00:49:40,028
For your information, President
Yeo said not to do it.

624
00:49:40,029 --> 00:49:43,368
She said it would destroy his
image and was totally against it.

625
00:49:43,369 --> 00:49:45,108
What do you think Yeon Soo?

626
00:49:45,109 --> 00:49:50,978
I don't really... How could I go shoot a commercial
independently? Can't we just all film together?

627
00:49:50,979 --> 00:49:54,728
Hyung you're perfect for it! The company's
promotions team are good at what they do.

628
00:49:54,729 --> 00:49:57,758
Perhaps I really would do
well standing in the back.

629
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:00,089
Looks like no. Don't do it.

630
00:50:01,469 --> 00:50:04,749
If it works out there will be residual
advertising fees, all in one big shot, huh?

631
00:50:06,409 --> 00:50:09,308
Let's hurry go to MT first.

632
00:50:09,309 --> 00:50:10,998
Let's shoot the advertisement
cleanly and go.

633
00:50:10,999 --> 00:50:13,368
Gosh, really.

634
00:50:13,369 --> 00:50:16,748
Green tomorrow go and
meet up with the team.

635
00:50:16,749 --> 00:50:21,008
Never mind going to the office and clean up
at Mango then you can go meet with them.

636
00:50:21,009 --> 00:50:22,679
Okay, CEO.

637
00:50:24,499 --> 00:50:27,868
Did CEO Yeo make it for you?
Did she push you?

638
00:50:27,869 --> 00:50:29,998
Hey stop.

639
00:50:29,999 --> 00:50:31,988
Then give me one section of an apartment.

-Your major?-Veterinary Medicine.

708
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:46,428
I did some studying. From Busan
I was in a university in Seoul.

709
00:54:46,429 --> 00:54:48,469
Veterinary Medicine...

710
00:54:49,699 --> 00:54:53,798
It fits you well! You would
give a shot to a dog well.

711
00:54:53,799 --> 00:54:58,389
My Professor said that it would be
perfect for me since I look like a dog.

714
00:55:19,739 --> 00:55:23,778
Of course it's sunglasses in a vacation!

-Pick yours out.-Me?

716
00:55:25,729 --> 00:55:28,508

00:55:28,509 --> 00:55:29,449
I'm okay.

718
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:31,908
Hurry and pick before you change your mind.

719
00:55:31,909 --> 00:55:33,378
Can I buy an expensive one?

720
00:55:33,379 --> 00:55:35,098
Pick a suitable one. A suitable one.

721
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:38,398
Because I'm pretty, anything
I pick will suit me.

722
00:55:38,399 --> 00:55:40,139
That's true.

Wow! This is good.

729
00:56:21,499 --> 00:56:23,598
Did you put that in and say they were
going to eat a lot of whatever like that?

730
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:25,569
Well, I mean...

734
00:56:37,509 --> 00:56:38,608
Ginseng liquor?

735
00:56:38,609 --> 00:56:41,098
It's a cousin of ginseng.

736
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:46,398
If you bring it, what are you like a
grandfather bringing 21 year old whiskey?

737
00:56:46,399 --> 00:56:49,908
You're saying that without knowing
how good this is for men.

738
00:56:49,909 --> 00:56:51,518
Then let's say Man Shik
is not drinking this.

739
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:55,838
But, I didn't say I wasn't going to drink it...
Well... Did I say that? What good would that be?
