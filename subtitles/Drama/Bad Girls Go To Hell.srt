1
00:00:38,537 --> 00:00:39,637
Okay go go go!

2
00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:40,437
Police, police, police.

3
00:00:40,438 --> 00:00:41,707
Who's got two?
Who's got two o'clock?

4
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,608
Get down! Get Down!

5
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:46,645
Drop the axe! Drop it!
Get down on the ground!

6
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:49,547
What the fuck?! Get down!
Get down.

7
00:00:49,548 --> 00:00:52,618
Drop the axe!
Drop the axe!

8
00:00:56,155 --> 00:00:59,840
<i>T1...What's the situation? Do
you copy?</i>

9
00:01:30,322 --> 00:01:33,190
Carlos. Listen to me.

10
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:35,792
Officer Lewis is my
parole officer, okay?

11
00:01:35,793 --> 00:01:38,732
I need you to call him and tell
him I'm at work! Got it?

12
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:44,335
Listen I... Listen to me.
I've got detention today.

13
00:01:44,336 --> 00:01:45,403
That's right.

14
00:01:45,404 --> 00:01:50,607
No. No, I'm not lying to him,
you're lying to him.

15
00:01:50,608 --> 00:01:51,977
Got it?

16
00:01:52,977 --> 00:01:56,614
Hey! Who keeps your business
going? This guy right here.

17
00:01:56,615 --> 00:01:57,884
Shit!

18
00:02:27,378 --> 00:02:30,916
<i>Listen, the first few weeks
of school have been weird.</i>

19
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,817
No she won't cover for
me because...

20
00:02:33,818 --> 00:02:35,255
No, she dumped me.

21
00:02:36,255 --> 00:02:37,424
Yes. Thank you!

22
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:41,894
Just have my back this one time.
Cover for me and...

23
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:44,398
I'll get yours another day.

24
00:02:46,398 --> 00:02:48,268
Today...

25
00:02:49,268 --> 00:02:52,449
I got other shit to sort out.

26
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:06,286
All fucktards, present
and accounted for, sir.

27
00:03:09,955 --> 00:03:13,991
Jesus Max! You scared the
hell out of me, buddy.

28
00:03:13,992 --> 00:03:16,298
Sorry Matt.

29
00:03:19,298 --> 00:03:22,972
So, where's D-Day?
I think there's been a mix-up.

30
00:03:26,972 --> 00:03:28,974
Okay.

31
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:35,980
Mister Clark, one does
not get to choose

32
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:38,882
when one serves detention!

33
00:03:38,883 --> 00:03:41,984
Particularly, in regards to your
behavior, I sincerely doubt

34
00:03:41,985 --> 00:03:44,925
that a mere detention would
satisfy this school's protocol.

35
00:03:46,925 --> 00:03:48,729
There's a chair. Use it.

36
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:54,733
Your first few weeks here
were infamous, to say the least.

37
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,735
Yeah.

38
00:03:56,735 --> 00:03:58,904
Thanks to those
spoiled T-baggers.

39
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,410
Hey, you wrote this?

40
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,511
Thank you Max.

41
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:08,312
You're new to Crestview,

42
00:04:08,313 --> 00:04:11,016
but your incessant need to blame
more fortunate students for

43
00:04:12,016 --> 00:04:14,351
your own misbehavior is
starting to trouble me.

44
00:04:14,352 --> 00:04:17,855
I thought our sessions were
helping us curtail our anger

45
00:04:17,856 --> 00:04:20,891
to build better leadership
skills?

46
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:25,496
Yeah. My uncle keeps telling me
that Clarks are born leaders.

47
00:04:25,497 --> 00:04:28,000
He drinks... A lot.

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,837
You may not take my tests
seriously, but the student

49
00:04:32,838 --> 00:04:35,772
body's dim opinion of you
aside, your responses to my

50
00:04:35,773 --> 00:04:39,877
psychological evaluations reflect
an unbalanced personality.

51
00:04:39,878 --> 00:04:42,979
Unbalanced?

52
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,915
<i>Mr. Clark?!</i>

53
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,055
And this?

54
00:04:50,055 --> 00:04:51,388
Boobs.

55
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:53,391
This?

56
00:04:53,392 --> 00:04:54,427
Bigger boobs?

57
00:04:55,427 --> 00:04:57,828
Vagina.

58
00:04:57,829 --> 00:05:01,569
Small boobs, but like..
weird nipples.

59
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:04,805
There's no...

60
00:05:07,805 --> 00:05:08,841
How about this one?

61
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:10,076
Judas Priest.

62
00:05:12,076 --> 00:05:16,446
You record those. What other
students you got in there?

63
00:05:16,447 --> 00:05:20,119
We record everything, Mr. Clark.
And that's none of your business.

64
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,953
Dr. Day? Uhh...

65
00:05:22,954 --> 00:05:26,556
My uncle's out of town for the
holidays. And my...

66
00:05:26,557 --> 00:05:30,427
boss is hassling me, and
just it would make it

67
00:05:30,428 --> 00:05:31,495
impossible for me...

68
00:05:31,496 --> 00:05:33,999
Are you certain you didn't
receive any further

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,872
reprimand from Crestview
this week?

70
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:45,811
I'm here because I want to make
things right. Please let me.

71
00:05:47,112 --> 00:05:48,115
Alright.

72
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:53,049
Alright, Matt. Against my
better judgment

73
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,453
I will let you serve your
detention. Today.

74
00:05:56,454 --> 00:05:58,591
Let's just hope the rest
show up.

75
00:05:59,591 --> 00:06:01,461
These are like paintings?

76
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:05,862
Yes, Max. They're a
bit like paintings.

77
00:06:05,863 --> 00:06:07,863
What does this painting look
like to you?

78
00:06:07,864 --> 00:06:10,134
It's like the art my
grandfather made.

79
00:06:10,135 --> 00:06:14,672
But he would sculpt, not paint.

80
00:06:14,673 --> 00:06:17,543
You just saw boobs.

81
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,044
How many bad kids today?

82
00:06:21,045 --> 00:06:25,088
Max, I wouldn't classify any of
our students as 'bad kids'.

83
00:06:31,088 --> 00:06:33,992
After Marquez drops me at the
airport, I'll send him back to

84
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:37,031
get you and wait until
you're dismissed.

85
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,498
I'll take a taxi.

86
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:43,900
Oh, and try to remember,
you kiss the babies.

87
00:06:43,901 --> 00:06:45,236
You don't eat them.

88
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:48,175
Ugh. I've certainly had a
stomach full of you.

89
00:06:50,175 --> 00:06:54,111
You see, Max, graduating
students often feel pressure,

90
00:06:54,112 --> 00:06:56,981
which causes them to
behave irrationally.

91
00:06:56,982 --> 00:06:58,916
<i>They tend to sabotage
themselves.</i>

92
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:01,986
<i>Their minds, their bodies,
are fragile,</i>

93
00:07:01,987 --> 00:07:04,923
<i>susceptible to all kinds
of negative influences.</i>

94
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,258
<i>More so than even they might
realize.</i>

95
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:10,061
You okay son?

96
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,629
Yeah. I'm okay.

97
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,999
What's that you have stuck
inside your cast?

98
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,665
Just my video camera.

99
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:18,709
I thought I'd record my one and
only day in detention.

100
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:28,545
Some students here are more prone
to subversive behavior than others.

101
00:07:28,546 --> 00:07:30,115
<i>And certainly take
pleasure influencing</i>

102
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,221
<i>their peers, in an
unsavory fashion.</i>

103
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:40,258
But it's the weaker students
who need the most guidance.

104
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,959
<i>They're the first to fall
in line behind the less</i>

105
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,960
<i>constructive students.</i>

106
00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:47,965
<i>For the weaker students,
failure hits them hardest.</i>

107
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:49,632
<i>They fall into a self
destructive pattern.</i>

108
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:52,137
When you mix all of these
personality types together

109
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,273
ten months out of the year, it's
no wonder

110
00:07:55,274 --> 00:08:00,044
<i>students succumb to fits
of jealousy, rage,</i>

111
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:02,088
<i>even paranoid delusion.</i>

112
00:08:11,088 --> 00:08:12,290
The new building looks nice,
father.

113
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:18,195
Time will tell. Hopefully, it
will serve its purpose. Yes?

114
00:08:18,596 --> 00:08:20,267
Now, go.

115
00:08:23,267 --> 00:08:25,681
I'm sorry, fath...

116
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,017
<i>It happens every
year every school</i>

117
00:08:39,017 --> 00:08:40,019
<i>Students lash out.</i>

118
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:45,024
<i>At their parents. Environment,
even at each other.</i>

119
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:49,028
<i>More often you hear on the TV
about that one young adult</i>

120
00:08:50,028 --> 00:08:52,033
<i>who finally snapped.</i>

121
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:59,316
<i>Honestly Max, it's a miracle
they don't all kill each other.</i>

122
00:09:11,316 --> 00:09:13,183
Sweet Jesus.

123
00:09:13,184 --> 00:09:14,351
You're kidding.

124
00:09:14,352 --> 00:09:16,320
God-damn.

125
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:19,226
Oh yeah. This is gonna rock.

126
00:09:22,226 --> 00:09:23,262
What?

127
00:09:25,062 --> 00:09:28,066
Let's go. Keep moving. The
books won't bite you.

128
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:09,373
Whoa.

129
00:10:09,374 --> 00:10:11,107
I moved it in here last night.

130
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:12,142
Yes, you did, Max.

131
00:10:12,143 --> 00:10:15,246
In the dark, and all by
yourself, I might add.

132
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:18,114
Yeah, it was scary.
I heard noises.

133
00:10:18,115 --> 00:10:20,784
You heard the ghost,
didn't you, Max?

134
00:10:20,785 --> 00:10:22,419
Ghost?
Please, Miss Harmon.

135
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,689
Max, it was the wind, or some
other treacherous piece

136
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:29,191
of equipment those lunk-head construction
workers leave behind every night.

137
00:10:29,192 --> 00:10:31,395
Whatever you heard, believe me,
it wasn't a ghost.

138
00:10:31,396 --> 00:10:32,729
I dig it, Max.

139
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:36,300
You would. It's weird
and freaky.

140
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:38,469
Just like you Megan.

141
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,337
Careful lighting the fuse on
her tampon. Her pops is the

142
00:10:41,338 --> 00:10:44,176
world's douchiest lawyer. You
may want to call it a draw.

143
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,243
No way.

144
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:48,880
Her little routine in the champagne
room got me in deep shit.

145
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:51,754
I know. I've seen all your
greatest hits.

146
00:10:55,754 --> 00:10:57,423
Yeah, that's you.

147
00:10:58,423 --> 00:11:00,258
Are you sad?

148
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:03,196
You don't fuck around with
making an impression.

149
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:06,299
It's Matt, right?

150
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:09,466
Okay.

151
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:12,235
Are you sure this place is safe?

152
00:11:12,236 --> 00:11:16,439
I'm confident the six of you can
survive an entire eight hours.

153
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,210
God forbid you actually
read something.

154
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:28,756
How's it hangin' Max-a million?

155
00:11:31,756 --> 00:11:32,990
Okay.

156
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,925
<i>Rome is the capital of Italy and
the country's largest and</i>

157
00:11:35,926 --> 00:11:40,197
<i>most populated city and commune
with over 2.7 million residents.</i>

158
00:11:40,198 --> 00:11:42,272
See? State of the art.

159
00:11:47,272 --> 00:11:49,473
We only have Intranet?!

160
00:11:49,474 --> 00:11:52,376
I bet they use it for
downloading dirty movies.

161
00:11:52,377 --> 00:11:56,549
No Max. See, the Intranet is a
local based Ethernet system.

162
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:00,350
Never mind.

163
00:12:00,351 --> 00:12:02,253
No Internet. Pathetic.

164
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,889
Sure, cause you got to keep up
with all your online charities.

165
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,258
Under-crust.

166
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:08,458
And he's a pervert.

167
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:11,962
You got off easy. This fuckin'
psycho put me in traction.

168
00:12:11,963 --> 00:12:15,832
And he attacks retarded people.
He's not a good person.

169
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,003
<i>He's disabled. Not retarded!</i>

170
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,203
Which is more than I can say
for any of you.

171
00:12:19,204 --> 00:12:24,980
The restroom! Mr. Clark,
perhaps you could lead the way?

172
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,850
Release the Kraken!

173
00:12:39,456 --> 00:12:40,273
<i>Ahhhhhh</i>

174
00:12:56,073 --> 00:12:57,279
Excuse.

175
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,447
Tricia, heard your mom is
ahead in the polls.

176
00:13:04,448 --> 00:13:05,884
Where's her next stop?

177
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:10,022
"Attila the Hen?" She left today
for, wherever.

178
00:13:11,022 --> 00:13:14,091
Out to get more money and
souls for the coffer.

179
00:13:14,092 --> 00:13:17,994
The picture of her, in Forbes.
She's beautiful.

180
00:13:17,995 --> 00:13:19,896
Her mom should date your pops.

181
00:13:19,897 --> 00:13:22,498
That pic of him in the paper
next to his client?

182
00:13:22,499 --> 00:13:24,566
How many billions did it say
that guy embezzled?

183
00:13:24,567 --> 00:13:27,005
From a pension fund, I
think. But your pops

184
00:13:28,005 --> 00:13:29,206
got him off, right?

185
00:13:29,207 --> 00:13:34,311
I see you outside, smoking,
most of the time. Veronica?

186
00:13:34,312 --> 00:13:35,211
You're new.

187
00:13:35,212 --> 00:13:37,412
Actually, "Red" I've been
here a year.

188
00:13:37,413 --> 00:13:38,649
Uh, that qualify me as "new?"

189
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:44,588
Uh, yes! It does at Crestview.
You're not a "lifer." Like us.

190
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:46,892
So what do your parents do,
Veronica?

191
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:52,830
Oh, God. Not too much.
They're both uh

192
00:13:54,331 --> 00:13:55,132
I'm sorry.

193
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:56,267
Don't be.

194
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:59,070
I probably talk to them more
than you talk to yours.

195
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,504
Yeah.

196
00:14:00,505 --> 00:14:02,106
Right, um, yeah,
I don't think so.

197
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:05,341
Sure I do.
Ever been to a seance?

198
00:14:05,342 --> 00:14:08,480
Uh. Okay. It looks like it is
about time for you to

199
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:11,382
drop a big deuce, Veronica

200
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:13,618
cause you're at maximum
capacity.

201
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:17,054
No, really, I talk with 'em
every day.

202
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,557
That's why I'm not fucked-up
like everyone else at Crest-Pew.

203
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:31,534
Uh, that's weird.

204
00:14:31,535 --> 00:14:35,471
And you're not funny.
All my parents do is work.

205
00:14:35,472 --> 00:14:37,074
I can never see them.

206
00:14:37,075 --> 00:14:38,209
You're lucky.

207
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,677
My mother's parental guidance
is completely Draconian.

208
00:14:41,678 --> 00:14:44,714
Speaking of parental guidance,
it's a shame D-Day

209
00:14:44,715 --> 00:14:47,085
has to waste his first day
of winter vacation

210
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:49,557
here at school, watching us.

211
00:14:53,557 --> 00:14:55,393
I think I'll send him
home early.

212
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:05,535
While pondering your erroneous
ways, the six of you will write

213
00:15:05,536 --> 00:15:08,137
a summary on the history of
Crestview Academy.

214
00:15:08,138 --> 00:15:10,605
Which, after the holidays,
Headmaster Nash will have the

215
00:15:10,606 --> 00:15:14,410
glorious pleasure of reading at a
dedication for this very library.

216
00:15:14,411 --> 00:15:15,413
And now, I leave you.

217
00:15:16,614 --> 00:15:20,416
And these finely crafted double
doors will remain locked

218
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:24,154
until I return for lunch,
another jaunt to the restroom,

219
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:27,157
and perhaps, a quick chat.

220
00:15:27,158 --> 00:15:33,096
And when he returned, the
room was filled with blood.

221
00:15:33,097 --> 00:15:34,101
<i>Dun-dun-dun - dunnnn.</i>

222
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,068
Joking. You know, 'cause of
the ghost and stuff?

223
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:41,437
Right then. I'll be off,

224
00:15:41,438 --> 00:15:44,476
unless there's anything
else I'm forgetting?

225
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:45,510
What?

226
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,578
Nice shot "champ." Try doing
that in the game.

227
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:50,048
Don't look at me like that.

228
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,047
Stupid.

229
00:15:51,048 --> 00:15:54,251
There's room for more. I'm sure
you're familiar with that phrase.

230
00:15:54,252 --> 00:15:56,220
Uh..I don't have one.

231
00:15:56,221 --> 00:16:00,025
Dr. Day, don't you know he's
the token welfare kid?

232
00:16:01,025 --> 00:16:04,160
And do think of this entire
building as one very large

233
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:07,631
non-smoking section. It would be
a pity if we had to spend next

234
00:16:07,632 --> 00:16:11,202
Saturday here because one of
you had a nic-fit.

235
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,571
Goodbye, Mr. Chips.

236
00:16:15,572 --> 00:16:16,640
But, his name is Dr. Day.

237
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:20,076
And now it's Willie.
Willie Makeittotheshitter?

238
00:16:20,077 --> 00:16:21,545
I don't get it.

239
00:16:21,546 --> 00:16:23,180
She put eyedrops in -

240
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:24,782
D-Day's coffee.

241
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:27,483
Great, so who's gonna let us
out for lunch?

242
00:16:27,484 --> 00:16:29,620
Or when you need to release
the Krakken?

243
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:32,096
Ohhh...

244
00:16:39,096 --> 00:16:41,667
Well, now that D-Day is gone, I
think we should all get togeth-

245
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:47,303
Hold it! God damn it.
Alright. New kids?

246
00:16:47,304 --> 00:16:51,240
Let's get one thing perfectly
clear. We're in detention.

247
00:16:51,241 --> 00:16:53,812
Yeah, this is not a
"love-in." This is not a hippy

248
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:58,715
commune like that sad, filthy,
flaming turd known as

249
00:16:58,716 --> 00:16:59,849
Megan, what's it called?
What's it called?

250
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,153
Uh... the Burning Man.

251
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:06,123
Burning Man. And this is not the
fucking feel-good 80's movie of

252
00:17:06,124 --> 00:17:09,257
the year, where for 7 hours, we
put aside our diffs and

253
00:17:09,258 --> 00:17:11,663
through commiserating about
our mutually

254
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:15,531
dysfunctional family lives, or
how lonely or alienated

255
00:17:15,532 --> 00:17:18,536
we each feel, we find some sort
of common ground, and end up

256
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:22,338
as BFFs. Okay? So let us
understand, there is no "us"

257
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:26,147
There is no "we." Because I
don't do "we." I just do "me."

258
00:17:30,147 --> 00:17:32,784
Well then, I'm out like a boner
in sweatpants!

259
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,826
Carlos, you call my P-O, yet?

260
00:18:49,827 --> 00:18:52,361
God Damn it, Carlos! Between
you, and the cast of

261
00:18:52,362 --> 00:18:54,865
<i>" Less Than Zero," I'm going
to snap, man!</i>

262
00:18:57,202 --> 00:19:00,369
Shit! Carlos? Look. You
gotta call my... uh...

263
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,705
Officer Lewis okay?
And tell him

264
00:19:01,706 --> 00:19:03,839
<i>You dropped something.</i>

265
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,681
You may want to grab it or one of
these uber-sized roaches will eat it.

266
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:12,950
Looks official. Can I read it?

267
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:13,917
Uh...

268
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:17,821
I think I should start
on the assignment.

269
00:19:17,822 --> 00:19:20,656
This library really is
haunted you know?

270
00:19:20,657 --> 00:19:22,925
Right. I'll be careful.

271
00:19:22,926 --> 00:19:25,798
If you came in here to jerk off,
I won't tell.

272
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:29,970
But you gotta let me watch.

273
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,605
C'mon, can't I get a
repeat performance?!

274
00:19:34,005 --> 00:19:36,472
That's not how it happened!

275
00:19:36,473 --> 00:19:38,246
Jeez, I was just kidding.

276
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,280
<i>Prior to the eighteenth century,</i>

277
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:46,450
<i>the tribe inhabited much
of northern Texas.</i>

278
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:49,852
<i>During the Lipan's history,
they have engaged in extremely</i>

279
00:19:49,853 --> 00:19:52,921
<i>violent battles with a number
of opposing forces</i>

280
00:19:52,922 --> 00:19:54,325
<i>in attempt to maintain
their land.</i>

281
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,360
Can I borrow a pen?

282
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,694
No. No you cannot.

283
00:19:58,695 --> 00:20:00,864
<i>The legends of the Lipan Apache</i>

284
00:20:00,865 --> 00:20:04,402
<i>are pivotal to understanding
their spiritual connection</i>

285
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:05,402
Ms. Gleason?

286
00:20:05,403 --> 00:20:06,403
<i>Yes, Matthew.</i>

287
00:20:06,404 --> 00:20:07,372
Can I go to the bathroom?

288
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,772
<i>Make it quick please.</i>

289
00:20:09,773 --> 00:20:12,509
<i>The legends of the Lipan Apache

290
00:20:14,511 --> 00:20:18,281
Veronica. Office, now!

291
00:20:18,282 --> 00:20:19,819
Shit.

292
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:24,887
Thank you... Max.

293
00:20:24,888 --> 00:20:27,489
<i>The legends of the Lipan apache

294
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:30,459
<i>understanding their spiritual
connection to the land.</i>

295
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:34,332
<i>Due to the fact that the entire
tribe was nearly exterminated,</i>

296
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:38,335
<i>there is almost no ethnographic
or scientific information</i>

297

<i>about them.</i>

298
00:20:41,939 --> 00:20:44,807
You did that on purpose.

299
00:20:44,808 --> 00:20:49,345
She deserved it. Okay?
She deserves a lot worse.

300
00:20:49,346 --> 00:20:53,950
It used to be our parents' jobs
made them boring and mean.

301
00:20:53,951 --> 00:20:56,819
But now, we're boring and mean.

302
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:02,792
I'm not boring. I'm bored. And
my parents are dead.

303
00:21:03,493 --> 00:21:04,561
So are mine.

304
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,085
God. Stupid.

305
00:22:48,132 --> 00:22:50,866
See? I told you! She's crazy!

306
00:22:50,867 --> 00:22:53,005
<i>turn it off.</i>

307
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:55,940
Bring the dancing girl to my
office.

308
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,613
I'll deal with the pervert.

309
00:23:02,613 --> 00:23:04,114
No. Uh. It's not

310
00:23:04,115 --> 00:23:06,083
Don't touch me sticky boy!
My office!

311
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:08,183
It's just my zip My Office!

312
00:23:08,184 --> 00:23:10,154
<i>I will not have you skanking it
up in my classroom!</i>

313
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,988
<i>Get off that desk!</i>

314
00:23:11,989 --> 00:23:13,656
The remix is way better.

315
00:23:13,657 --> 00:23:16,125
Word. Gotta love the YouTube.

316
00:23:16,126 --> 00:23:19,629
Not as much as my father's
law firm. He's going

317
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:23,634
to make a mint suing them.
And whoever uploaded that video.

318
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:27,770
I know that everyone at
Crestview thinks I'm Arrogant

319
00:23:27,771 --> 00:23:32,174
Smarter, than everyone else.
And I am. But when you

320
00:23:32,175 --> 00:23:36,712
deal with as many haters as
I do, it taxes your nerves.

321
00:23:36,713 --> 00:23:39,914
Interesting. Stress leads to
"Girls Gone Wild."

322
00:23:39,915 --> 00:23:40,716
Look who's talking.

323
00:23:40,717 --> 00:23:41,919
Look who's stripping.

324
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,220
<i>Ooooh.</i>

325
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:46,490
Practicing witchcraft might make
someone a freak but not a slut.

326
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:47,223
<i>Right.</i>

327
00:23:47,224 --> 00:23:49,558
But I might be both.

328
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:50,693
<i>Cool.</i>

329
00:23:50,694 --> 00:23:52,694
But you telling me, that you
get one little catty

330
00:23:52,695 --> 00:23:54,196
note too many. It's a fucking
joke!

331
00:23:54,197 --> 00:23:57,632
Look. I'm telling all of you,
like I told Dr. Day,

332
00:23:57,633 --> 00:24:00,702
like I told the school board,
I've been stressed!

333
00:24:00,703 --> 00:24:03,207
And on the advice of a
really, really, really

334
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:08,210
expensive lawyer,
I've said all I can say.

335
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:10,613
I know, right? And she's the
fucking nerd of this party.

336
00:24:10,614 --> 00:24:13,250
And you're the fucking freak
who says she talks to corpse.

337
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:15,951
Obviously. She's talking to you.

338
00:24:15,952 --> 00:24:19,623
Aww... You two.
Metal and Goth come together

339
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,222
in the haunted library.
It's really sweet.

340
00:24:21,223 --> 00:24:25,962
Don't patronize me, bitch. My parents
are not on your mommy's pay roll.

341
00:24:27,064 --> 00:24:28,130
And this place is haunted, and
everybody knows it.

342
00:24:28,131 --> 00:24:31,065
It happened last year when
that old dude died.

343
00:24:31,066 --> 00:24:33,969
My first year at Crestview, and
the school fucks over

344
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:36,574
this geriatric Indian, to take
his house.

345
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:41,111
Then demolishes it to
build, this.

346
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:46,982
Really? An Indian? You know
and "Indian" Indian?

347
00:24:46,983 --> 00:24:49,119
Strange, but true, Scooby-Doo.

348
00:24:50,721 --> 00:24:53,657
And ever since then, this entire
school has been cursed.

349
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,693
All that haunted library shit
is shit.

350
00:25:00,196 --> 00:25:02,131
You afraid of ghosts, tough guy?

351
00:25:02,132 --> 00:25:05,633
You know this cast is going to come
off one day, right, tough guy?

352
00:25:05,634 --> 00:25:09,173
We could find out if this place is
cursed if you really wanted to.

353
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,039
<i>How?</i>

354
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,308
Yes.

355
00:25:12,309 --> 00:25:14,143
Howwww?

356
00:25:14,144 --> 00:25:17,582
Wow. Jesus fucking christ.

357
00:25:34,365 --> 00:25:36,701
The pictures are
familiar to the spirit.

358
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,672
Spread them on the table.

359
00:25:41,672 --> 00:25:43,272
They look really angry.

360
00:25:43,273 --> 00:25:47,310
I would be too. Since this guy,
General Andrew Winston Clark,

361
00:25:47,311 --> 00:25:51,314
stole some land from an Apache
tribe, back in the 1870s.

362
00:25:51,315 --> 00:25:53,084
Land that became Crestview.

363
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:56,321
Clark? Any kin to you?

364
00:25:58,321 --> 00:26:02,258
No way. This guy led a whole
calvary into battle.

365
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:05,128
But he did steal the land and
kill a bunch of natives.

366
00:26:05,129 --> 00:26:07,329
So, it's a tough call.

367
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,833
Do you really worship the devil?

368
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:12,802
I do not worship the devil.

369
00:26:12,803 --> 00:26:14,671
I just promote him.

370
00:26:14,672 --> 00:26:18,141
Okay. Everyone, open your minds
and your thoughts.

371
00:26:18,142 --> 00:26:21,077
Pretend you're in one of D-Day's
bullshit new age therapy sessions.

372
00:26:21,078 --> 00:26:24,079
Relax your mind, Mr. Cook.

373
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,018
And tell me what you feel and what
you see, and Oh my God. Those tests.

374
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:30,787
His psych evals are
ridiculously in-depth.

375
00:26:30,788 --> 00:26:32,689
I saw boobs. And rock.

376
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:34,355
Awesome. Who wants
to be the medium?

377
00:26:34,356 --> 00:26:35,457
Aren't you the medium?

378
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:37,191
I can't be the medium,
I'm the guide. Someone else

379
00:26:37,192 --> 00:26:39,329
has to be the medium, and so,
Tricia's the medium.

380
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,230
What? Me?

381
00:26:41,231 --> 00:26:45,710
Look, if you guys are really
scared, we don't have to Scared?

382
00:26:45,736 --> 00:26:48,238
No, I'm not scared.
Let's do this.

383
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:51,844
Don't worry, I'll guide you as
you're channeling the spirit.

384
00:26:53,844 --> 00:26:56,747
The ringing of the bell will
signify the spirit's presence.

385
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:59,215
Everyone, join hands.

386
00:27:01,117 --> 00:27:04,855
Whatever we do, our hands must stay
clasped, to keep the circle unbroken.

387
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:09,693
Now, together,
breathe in unison.

388
00:27:10,861 --> 00:27:12,864
You okay?

389
00:27:13,864 --> 00:27:17,768
Everyone, move into a welcoming
state. Imagine a time you were

390
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:22,404
eagerly awaiting someone coming
into town: A friend, a relative.

391
00:27:22,405 --> 00:27:25,375
Then focus on the presence we
want to join us.

392
00:27:25,376 --> 00:27:28,912
We welcome you, spirit.
Are you there?

393
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:31,949
Tricia, tell the spirit we
feel his presence here.

394
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,951
We feel your presence here.

395
00:27:34,952 --> 00:27:38,320
Tricia, tell the spirit to
show us his presence.

396
00:27:38,321 --> 00:27:40,390
Is the presence circumcised?

397
00:27:40,391 --> 00:27:42,727
Maybe he's not packing
a very big presence.

398
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:47,900
Tricia, tell the spirit to
show us his presence.

399
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,440
Spirit? Show us your presence.

400
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,508
Well, that was fun.

401
00:27:58,509 --> 00:28:00,310
Man, I told you, this is
some bull

402
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:10,327
Keep your hands together!
Don't break the circle!

403
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:17,827
You're doing this!
This is a trick!

404
00:28:17,828 --> 00:28:20,207
No, I'm not doing anything!

405
00:28:43,887 --> 00:28:45,287
What happened?

406
00:28:45,288 --> 00:28:48,490
Meg? Meg? Breathe Meg!

407
00:28:48,491 --> 00:28:49,959
Megan!

408
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,502
You don't see it?!

409
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:03,239
Oh shit.

410
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,553
Wait. Is she? Is she really?

411
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:17,252
What the fuck, man?!

412
00:29:17,253 --> 00:29:19,522
Jesus, what the hell? What the
fuck is your problem, man?!?

413
00:29:19,523 --> 00:29:25,295
I'm sorry, I thought, I
thought that you guys she's,

414
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:26,296
she's really

415
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:30,299
Yes! She's really fucking dead,
you assholes!

416
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,367
God.

417
00:29:32,368 --> 00:29:34,304
D-Day has our phones.

418
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:35,970
And the construction crew is
gone during winter break.

419
00:29:35,971 --> 00:29:37,407
Everyone's gone during
winter break.

420
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:42,879
Oh shit. Out of juice. Okay. I
got maybe enough for one call.

421
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,880
9-1-1?

422
00:29:43,881 --> 00:29:46,950
Wait! If they put you on hold,
we're fucked.

423
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:50,920
Carlos. Yeah Carlos never
leaves his work.

424
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:53,057
Carlos! Carlos, listen to me,
listen to me

425
00:29:56,894 --> 00:29:58,561
Who the fuck is Carlos?!

426
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,146
Just hit it open Craig!

427
00:30:18,147 --> 00:30:20,917
Jesus, dude, you're just gonna
split your crutch!

428
00:30:20,918 --> 00:30:21,991
Damn!

429
00:30:27,391 --> 00:30:33,273
Stop! The axe will break! Okay, these
doors are titanium steel alloy!

430
00:30:43,473 --> 00:30:44,557
Hold this.

431
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:27,650
<i>We're trapped.</i>

432
00:31:27,651 --> 00:31:30,385
Yeah. With it.

433
00:31:30,386 --> 00:31:33,989
Jesus, it's just the storm
messing with the lights.

434
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,090
Oh yeah? What about the bell?!

435
00:31:35,091 --> 00:31:36,460
It's wind drafts blowing.

436
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,594
That was not a wind draft!

437
00:31:38,595 --> 00:31:39,296
I don't know.

438
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:41,530
Like he said. It was the wind.

439
00:31:41,531 --> 00:31:45,400
But I saw it! Okay! All of you
saw it and heard it, too!

440
00:31:45,401 --> 00:31:48,402
Either a fuse or a transformer
got hit and overloaded

441
00:31:48,403 --> 00:31:50,608
the lights. Okay, it makes a
low pitched wailing sound

442
00:31:51,008 --> 00:31:52,240
like we heard in the room.

443
00:31:52,241 --> 00:31:55,679
Please stop debating light
distortions and sound waves,

444
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,647
and figure out what
we're going to do!

445
00:31:58,648 --> 00:32:01,531
I don't know.
Let's check our backpacks.

446
00:32:15,531 --> 00:32:16,466
What is this?

447
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:19,135
Uh, that?

448
00:32:25,709 --> 00:32:28,546
Study hall can be so boring.

449
00:32:29,546 --> 00:32:35,352
I got a cable wire.
I got nothin'

450
00:32:36,653 --> 00:32:38,653
What's this?

451
00:32:38,654 --> 00:32:40,056
What is that?

452
00:32:40,057 --> 00:32:43,459
Perhaps a letter of commendation?

453
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:47,094
Crest-peww mails them to all
their future world leaders.

454
00:32:47,095 --> 00:32:48,198
What's the matter?
You don't trust me?

455
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:49,231
Do I need to?

456
00:32:49,232 --> 00:32:51,066
It couldn't hurt.

457
00:32:51,067 --> 00:32:53,268
Yes it would.

458
00:32:53,269 --> 00:32:56,072
Tricia? Your backpack?

459
00:32:56,073 --> 00:32:57,472
A backpack?

460
00:32:57,473 --> 00:33:00,682
- Just take it out.
- What do you have?

461
00:33:05,682 --> 00:33:10,625
Ooh!
Ahh...

462
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,162
Hey! Hey!

463
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:21,766
<i>Oh my goodness!</i>

464
00:33:22,766 --> 00:33:25,702
You know we've got bigger stuff
to deal with than judging you.

465
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:28,654
Holy shit, I am so relieved.
Really!

466
00:33:44,654 --> 00:33:47,222
You sneaky little mother fu...

467
00:33:47,223 --> 00:33:49,757
I don't know how it got in
there! I swear I didn't take it!

468
00:33:49,758 --> 00:33:52,727
Last week, in the lunchroom,
like that, you didn't take it?

469
00:33:52,728 --> 00:33:54,261
I don't know what
he's talking about!

470
00:33:54,262 --> 00:33:55,162
Alright, don't listen to him!

471
00:33:55,163 --> 00:33:56,133
He's not a good person!

472
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:59,201
I'm talking about this!
In the lunchroom.

473
00:33:59,202 --> 00:34:01,642
I figured out what you pulled.

474
00:34:05,642 --> 00:34:08,210
Hey! Watch it!

475
00:34:08,211 --> 00:34:11,147
Sorry!

476
00:34:11,148 --> 00:34:12,782
- Hey, can I get a napkin?
- No.

477
00:34:12,783 --> 00:34:18,754
Hey, listen, asshole!
I just want a napkin.

478
00:34:18,755 --> 00:34:20,823
Oh. Sorry.

479
00:34:20,824 --> 00:34:23,860
A leader remains calm in the
face of adversity, Mister Clark.

480
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:27,129
And I am.
Just like you taught me.

481
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:28,698
Excellent.

482
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:31,200
Veronica! Office! Now!

483
00:34:31,201 --> 00:34:33,235
Look. It wasn't her fault. Okay?
It was an accident.

484
00:34:33,236 --> 00:34:36,139
- She didn't mean to do it.
- No. She did. She always means it.

485
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,207
And what about Megan? Hmm?

486
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,842
Was her strip show one of your
Leadership Mantras?

487
00:34:40,843 --> 00:34:43,612
A detention does seem rather
trite, but I'm afraid her father

488
00:34:43,613 --> 00:34:44,748
carries a certain amount
of influence.

489
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:48,884
However, if you are able to
earn early acceptance to

490
00:34:48,885 --> 00:34:52,287
Harvard as did Miss McDurst,
then perhaps I can discuss

491
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,326
reducing your chores with
Headmaster Nash.

492
00:34:56,326 --> 00:34:57,827
Thanks D-Day.
I'd appreciate that.

493
00:34:57,828 --> 00:35:01,196
Right, then, I'll be off.

494
00:35:01,197 --> 00:35:04,798
I believe I read something
about a General Clark once.

495
00:35:04,799 --> 00:35:06,867
Apparently, he was a
most capable leader.

496
00:35:06,868 --> 00:35:07,735
Who knows maybe

497
00:35:07,736 --> 00:35:09,273
Maybe it skips a generation?

498
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,473
Perhaps.

499
00:35:10,474 --> 00:35:14,676
Although, he wasn't very
popular with the locals either.

500
00:35:14,677 --> 00:35:15,878
<i>Excuse me. Find your seats.</i>

501
00:35:15,879 --> 00:35:17,031
Hey!

502
00:35:35,431 --> 00:35:36,606
Hey!

503
00:35:43,206 --> 00:35:45,914
That dude stole my soup.

504
00:36:12,768 --> 00:36:13,805
Ahhhhhhhhh!

505
00:36:15,405 --> 00:36:18,941
Where you rushing off to?

506
00:36:18,942 --> 00:36:21,810
Mister Clark! Here at Crestview

507
00:36:21,811 --> 00:36:25,814
we frown upon attacking
the retarded students.

508
00:36:25,815 --> 00:36:27,850
He's not retarded. I was

509
00:36:27,851 --> 00:36:28,984
I was just

510
00:36:28,985 --> 00:36:30,954
You were just on your way
to my office Mister Clark.

511
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:34,723
But Tarek stole my soup!

512
00:36:34,724 --> 00:36:38,861
You stole food from a wheelchair
bound retarded boy.

513
00:36:38,862 --> 00:36:40,696
I'm not retarded!

514
00:36:40,697 --> 00:36:42,000
Of course not. Good for you.

515
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,834
Mister Clark! Let's go!

516
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:45,968
You too!

517
00:36:45,969 --> 00:36:46,968
Are you okay?

518
00:36:46,969 --> 00:36:47,903
<i>That has to be the most</i>

519
00:36:47,904 --> 00:36:50,704
bullshit story I've ever heard
in my life.

520
00:36:50,705 --> 00:36:51,809
You believe me, right?

521
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:54,378
I only saw you tackle the
retarded kid.

522
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:57,446
I swear! I did not take
Megan's inhaler!

523
00:36:57,447 --> 00:36:58,914
He's the criminal. Not me!

524
00:36:58,915 --> 00:37:02,417
Then why wasn't the inhaler in
my backpack?

525
00:37:02,418 --> 00:37:04,818
Perhaps, there have been things
that have recently

526
00:37:04,819 --> 00:37:06,420
caused me some stress. Okay?

527
00:37:06,421 --> 00:37:09,791
And I may or may not have always
acted rationally.

528
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:11,860
Okay. You!- all of you-don't understand.

529
00:37:11,861 --> 00:37:13,528
You don't understand my father.
Okay?

530
00:37:13,529 --> 00:37:17,333
He does not tolerate failure.
I must get into a good school.

531
00:37:17,334 --> 00:37:18,868
So you're saying

532
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:21,735
What I'm saying is that today,
in this library,

533
00:37:21,736 --> 00:37:22,970
I did not steal Megan's inhaler.

534
00:37:22,971 --> 00:37:26,342
What I'm saying is, how did it
get in your fucking backpack?!

535
00:37:26,343 --> 00:37:27,410
I don't know!

536
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:32,747
Sha-zam! The Crest-pew
Intranet in full effect!

537
00:37:32,748 --> 00:37:36,387
Took some digging in the local
papers, but I found our dead Indian.

538
00:37:38,387 --> 00:37:42,325
Jacob Rainwater? Not much of an
obituary.

539
00:37:42,326 --> 00:37:45,328
Rainwater is survived by one
family member

540
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:47,929
prior to the city taking
possession of his home, he was

541
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:50,333
housed at the local psychiatric
ward for a month, before he

542
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:51,901
jumped out a window.

543
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:56,104
The city of Crestview has been declared
executor for the Rainwater estate.

544
00:37:56,105 --> 00:37:59,039
Wouldn't next of kin take
possession of his house?

545
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,845
It's Crestview. Property taxes reside
somewhere in Never-Never Land.

546
00:38:02,846 --> 00:38:05,514
I doubt any of his kin is a
real high roller.

547
00:38:05,515 --> 00:38:08,551
Poor old guy died broke
and alone.

548
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:11,386
I bet you can relate, huh?

549
00:38:11,387 --> 00:38:14,857
Look, all of this is
just a coincidence.

550
00:38:14,858 --> 00:38:16,791
I don't believe in coincidences.

551
00:38:16,792 --> 00:38:19,429
Neither do I. And there is no
such thing as ghosts.

552
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:22,364
Exactly. And thank you.

553
00:38:22,365 --> 00:38:26,935
And fuck you for the shit you
said before that.

554
00:38:26,936 --> 00:38:28,205
All of us were in that room!

555
00:38:29,005 --> 00:38:33,408
We were all holding hands!
I did not steal her inhaler.

556
00:38:33,409 --> 00:38:35,949
Maybe Tarek is
telling the truth!

557
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:44,888
The lights, the bell, the draft,
all of those fucking roaches.

558
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,958
Something is in here... with us.

559
00:38:52,161 --> 00:38:56,499
It's him. It's Rainwater.
He's here.

560
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,101
Or, it's just the storm
messing with

561
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:07,465
A wind draft!

562
00:39:31,201 --> 00:39:34,601
I've got to get out of here. I
gotta get out of here right now.

563
00:39:34,602 --> 00:39:36,005
You're not going anywhere!

564
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:38,640
Can't you just get rid of it?!

565
00:39:38,641 --> 00:39:42,050
It's not like your last
pregnancy, okay?

566
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:52,989
That was me, you assholes!
Up here! Look what I found!

567
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:58,627
Wow! It's a convincing, logical
end to this argument!

568
00:39:58,628 --> 00:40:02,964
This is the sound ghosts make
to scare douchebags!

569
00:40:02,965 --> 00:40:08,865
oooooooh, douchebaaags, oooaaa,
Judas Priest.

570
00:40:19,048 --> 00:40:22,184
Air flows from the outside
vent right into this room,

571
00:40:22,185 --> 00:40:25,053
which means there might
be a way out.

572
00:40:25,054 --> 00:40:27,655
It's a maze up there, but I
think this duct may empty

573
00:40:27,656 --> 00:40:30,258
out into the vent right above
the parking lot.

574
00:40:30,259 --> 00:40:33,561
So we go get my cable wire, tie
it around someone's waist,

575
00:40:33,562 --> 00:40:35,699
and follow our way back
to the vents.

576
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,066
Meaning your waist.

577
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:38,101
Who elected him leader?

578
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,734
You did.

579
00:40:39,735 --> 00:40:41,136
Injured.

580
00:40:41,137 --> 00:40:42,370
Hamas.

581
00:40:42,371 --> 00:40:45,206
Scared and worthless, and that's
before any of this happened.

582
00:40:45,207 --> 00:40:49,211
And, it's a toss up. Either
"can't fit" or "too fuckin' stupid."

583
00:40:49,212 --> 00:40:52,046
Your choice.

584
00:40:52,047 --> 00:40:55,084
- Bitch!
- Shut up, Craig. She's right!

585
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:57,188
I never said I was going
back in there.

586
00:40:59,188 --> 00:41:01,255
Look, you may or may
not be sane.

587
00:41:01,256 --> 00:41:03,691
And maybe you're not related to
any famous Generals,

588
00:41:03,692 --> 00:41:06,096
but if any of D-Day's poking and
prodding has helped

589
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:10,031
release a new and improved Matt
Clark, I need him.

590
00:41:10,032 --> 00:41:12,666
You've been up there once,
you can do it again.

591
00:41:12,667 --> 00:41:16,172
If you don't go, who knows how
long we'd be stuck here.

592
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:17,239
Trust me, Matt.

593
00:41:26,715 --> 00:41:30,322
Ugh. I've got to get myself
to the hospital.

594
00:41:32,322 --> 00:41:35,156
I would take you,
but I have deliveries.

595
00:41:35,157 --> 00:41:36,225
Deliveries?

596
00:41:36,226 --> 00:41:38,298
Yeah. Maintenance and
deliveries. That's my job.

597
00:41:42,298 --> 00:41:43,399
No, no, no, Max.

598
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,106
You need to stay here and keep
an eye on the kids.

599
00:41:50,106 --> 00:41:55,012
Max! Dr. Day! Max!
Max! Up here!

600
00:41:56,012 --> 00:41:57,012
I'll be quick.

601
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:03,051
I'll hold the fort.

602
00:42:03,052 --> 00:42:06,827
Up here! Maaaax!

603
00:42:37,654 --> 00:42:40,321
Ahhhhhhh.

604
00:42:40,322 --> 00:42:45,708
Ewww. Gawww. Ewwww. Ugghhh.

605
00:43:29,438 --> 00:43:31,717
Oh shit!

606
00:44:14,717 --> 00:44:16,751
Someone got a nasty
progress report.

607
00:44:16,752 --> 00:44:18,221
That's not what you think.

608
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:23,158
Really? Because I think it's your
transcripts from a local hoosegow.

609
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:25,959
f we could call the cops would
your parole officer tell

610
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,896
us why your record's
been sealed?

611
00:44:27,897 --> 00:44:30,466
It was sealed because
I was a minor.

612
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:33,767
And it was a juvenile detention
facility. Not jail.

613
00:44:33,768 --> 00:44:35,936
And I did my time. Okay? So if
you guys are

614
00:44:35,937 --> 00:44:38,311
waiting for some big
reveal, forget it!

615
00:44:42,311 --> 00:44:46,915
In juvee, were you raped?

616
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:48,216
Like a lot?

617
00:44:48,217 --> 00:44:51,820
I told you. He's a fucking liar
and anything but a good person!

618
00:44:51,821 --> 00:44:54,455
Shut up terrorist!

619
00:44:54,456 --> 00:44:56,992
Placed under the same scrutiny
of the law that I was

620
00:44:56,993 --> 00:44:58,893
You'd be stoned to death.

621
00:44:58,894 --> 00:45:02,196
You crackhead. You'd get the
needle.

622
00:45:02,197 --> 00:45:03,800
You'd die alone in your cell.

623
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:09,405
And you? You would be hanged.
Oh, and I'd enjoy it!

624
00:45:28,324 --> 00:45:31,327
Excuse me. Do you have any Katy
Perry or Britney Spears?

625
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:35,430
Oh, let me check.
Oh, no sorry I don't!

626
00:45:35,431 --> 00:45:38,938
Who doesn't have any Katy Perry
or Britney Spears?

627
00:45:41,938 --> 00:45:47,276
Jesus. Everybody wants something
from someone at this school.

628
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:49,477
I don't want anything from you.

629
00:45:49,478 --> 00:45:53,582
Really? Why not?

630
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:56,420
Because I don't think
anything will help.

631
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:01,957
Ay ay ay, I hate this mascot
shit.

632
00:46:01,958 --> 00:46:03,407
Move!

633
00:46:18,407 --> 00:46:19,409
Damn! Tricia?!

634
00:46:20,009 --> 00:46:21,910
What?

635
00:46:21,911 --> 00:46:23,980
When I said I wanted a
bitch with me on stage,

636
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:28,082
I meant my bitch.

637
00:46:28,083 --> 00:46:31,053
Not the bitch.

638
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:33,055
What can I say Craig?

639
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:36,858
CrestView demands a strong
Indian Princess. And that's me.

640
00:46:36,859 --> 00:46:39,025
It's not like your mother had
anything to do with the voting.

641
00:46:39,026 --> 00:46:42,530
Ugh. If voting actually worked,
Crestview would make it illegal.

642
00:46:42,531 --> 00:46:45,568
This entire school is about you.
Every year. Every day.

643
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:49,576
Let me have my day.
I'm just saying.

644
00:46:53,576 --> 00:46:57,345
You really don't get it do you?
See, I thought my mother

645
00:46:57,346 --> 00:47:00,119
and her associates made it
perfectly clear to you.

646
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:08,589
Everyone has scars. I know how
you got yours.

647
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:11,493
What if everyone else did?

648
00:47:11,494 --> 00:47:13,896
How does it feel knowing your
entire life has been bought?

649
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:17,633
I don't know, Craig. Why don't
you ask your daddy.

650
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:20,435
My mother bought him a
long time ago.

651
00:47:20,436 --> 00:47:26,414
So, I'd be very careful what
you say and who you say it to.

652
00:47:32,014 --> 00:47:34,348
Poor old Governor Wilkes.

653
00:47:34,349 --> 00:47:37,945
Always propping up that hole
in her billfold!

654
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:06,113
Apaches, let's show some school
spirit for Headmaster Nash!

655
00:48:06,114 --> 00:48:08,116
Boo!

656
00:48:08,117 --> 00:48:11,585
Thank you! Now it is time

657
00:48:11,586 --> 00:48:14,523
Now it is time to play a song
for the guy who

658
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:18,702
said he doesn't want anything
from me.

659
00:48:26,702 --> 00:48:31,138
Students! Take a good
look at Miss Harmon.

660
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:34,408
Don't end up like her!

661
00:48:34,409 --> 00:48:35,701
Max!

662
00:48:58,701 --> 00:49:01,215
Tricia! Tricia! Tricia! Tricia!

663
00:49:46,215 --> 00:49:49,619
One guess who put the bowl of
punch above the stage.

664
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,559
One guess.

665
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:57,658
Craig?

666
00:49:57,659 --> 00:50:00,495
What?

667
00:50:00,496 --> 00:50:04,232
Well, you don't actually.
You actually believe him?

668
00:50:04,233 --> 00:50:05,700
He's a jailrat!

669
00:50:05,701 --> 00:50:07,301
He's a piece of shit!

670
00:50:07,302 --> 00:50:11,272
He's a broke little bitch.
He's undercrust! He's

671
00:50:11,273 --> 00:50:13,707
A guy with proof.

672
00:50:13,708 --> 00:50:15,643
Is that your dick?

673
00:50:15,644 --> 00:50:17,245
That's my zipper.

674
00:50:17,246 --> 00:50:19,282
Okay. Good. 'Cause for a
second I thought.

675
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:24,798
And our next feature
presentation?

676
00:50:36,798 --> 00:50:41,268
Aww, you two. Deception meets
bitterness in the haunted library.

677
00:50:41,269 --> 00:50:44,537
Bastard! Why the fuck would you
do that to me Craig?

678
00:50:44,538 --> 00:50:46,809
Why the fuck did you do
that to me? Answer me!

679
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:49,315
Okay. Hey!

680
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:57,319
You think you hate me because
I'm rich, popular, and banging a

681
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,622
different bitch every weekend.
But that's not why you hate me.

682
00:51:01,623 --> 00:51:04,292
I think that's why I hate you.

683
00:51:04,293 --> 00:51:09,196
No. You hate me because
I have options.

684
00:51:09,197 --> 00:51:11,567
Any virtue you might have,
is because your options

685
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:15,837
are limited. Maybe you're not
such a gangster after all.

686
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:20,142
Maybe because you can't afford
it!

687
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:24,846
Well, that's actually kind of
insightful asshole!

688
00:51:24,847 --> 00:51:28,582
Exactly. Two pretentious
assholes Shut up!

689
00:51:28,583 --> 00:51:30,717
Both of you are just as
pretentious as we are.

690
00:51:30,718 --> 00:51:34,255
Your ordinary little friends would slit
your throats for hanging out with us.

691
00:51:34,256 --> 00:51:36,222
And you'd slit your own
throats before letting anyone

692
00:51:36,223 --> 00:51:38,360
know how ordinary
you really are.

693
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:39,395
Fuck you!

694
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:41,197
Why? Because he's wrong?
Or because he's right?

695
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:42,730
Not you.

696
00:51:42,731 --> 00:51:44,298
Not this broke mother fucker.

697
00:51:44,299 --> 00:51:46,333
Or some coke head queen who gets
a Kool-Aid cum stain

698
00:51:46,334 --> 00:51:48,871
on their dress is worth
me getting upset.

699
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:52,640
I'm getting out of here.
That's my focus.

700
00:51:52,641 --> 00:51:55,609
And none of you are worth
the distraction.

701
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:57,880
I don't think our ghost
cares about your personal

702
00:51:57,881 --> 00:51:59,915
goals and failures, hotshot.

703
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:03,651
Good. Because he's a
shitty lay.

704
00:52:03,652 --> 00:52:05,287
Whatever.

705
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:06,922
And one seriously dumb nigger.

706
00:52:08,356 --> 00:52:10,725
That was so not Twilight.

707
00:52:10,726 --> 00:52:12,627
Bitch! I will fuck you up!

708
00:52:12,628 --> 00:52:13,860
Whoa! Stop it! Stop it!
That's enough!

709
00:52:13,861 --> 00:52:14,998
Get your hands off.

710
00:52:14,999 --> 00:52:20,935
Stop it! Back off you two! God!
You are both just you

711
00:52:21,836 --> 00:52:24,838
And there's no turning back! Do
you really believe your

712
00:52:24,839 --> 00:52:27,842
parents' money can buy you out of who
you are and the shit that you do?

713
00:52:29,644 --> 00:52:34,381
Check it out: A second class
criminal lecturing me on morality.

714
00:52:34,382 --> 00:52:38,653
I've been smelling your bullshit
since we walked in here.

715
00:52:38,654 --> 00:52:44,594
I saw the detention list this
morning. Your name wasn't on it.

716
00:52:46,295 --> 00:52:52,201
Why are you in here? With us?
C'mon, you can tell me

717
00:52:53,802 --> 00:52:59,702
Juvee, Jailbird, Gangsta, What
did they lock you up for?

718
00:53:02,978 --> 00:53:05,947
You know, the next time a
guidance counselor

719
00:53:05,948 --> 00:53:08,950
tells you to "just be yourself"

720
00:53:08,951 --> 00:53:10,051
Don't.

721
00:53:12,954 --> 00:53:18,427
Wai, wai, wai, wai, wait!
Where is Tarek?

722
00:53:22,764 --> 00:53:24,732
Sneaky little mother fucker!

723
00:53:24,733 --> 00:53:30,633
Well, he is Arab. Or Armenian?
Or something with curly pubes.

724
00:53:33,876 --> 00:53:36,710
Yeah, fuck it!

725
00:53:36,711 --> 00:53:38,214
That little guy was
scared shitless.

726
00:53:39,014 --> 00:53:43,994
But he still went for it. It's
not like he saw a floor plan.

727
00:53:51,994 --> 00:53:54,501
Tarek's dad built this place!

728
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:01,807
Pull up that article about
Rainwater's house.

729
00:54:11,012 --> 00:54:14,783
On behalf of the city, McDurst
& DeLaney filed suit

730
00:54:14,784 --> 00:54:17,485
to acquire said residence
from the deceased.

731
00:54:17,486 --> 00:54:18,752
McDurst?

732
00:54:18,753 --> 00:54:20,355
Megan's father.

733
00:54:20,356 --> 00:54:22,391
And the city councilman
who drove the

734
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:26,696
ordinance against Rainwater?

735
00:54:27,496 --> 00:54:32,201
And since mommy owns everyone's daddy,
what part did she play in all this? Hmm?

736
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:36,837
Jesus, Matt! Didn't you see the
sign outside? Who do you think

737
00:54:36,838 --> 00:54:39,441
this library is named after?

738
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:41,441
The school gets a new library.

739
00:54:41,442 --> 00:54:43,978
Our parents get guarantees
we graduate.

740
00:54:43,979 --> 00:54:45,514
No matter what.

741
00:54:47,349 --> 00:54:51,819
With honors, I'm sure. Still
think this is a coincidence?

742
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:54,855
I don't know. But man,

743
00:54:54,856 --> 00:54:57,090
their parents are way bigger
douchebags than I thought!

744
00:54:57,091 --> 00:54:59,025
At least they can afford to
keep us out of the joint.

745
00:54:59,026 --> 00:55:01,996
Right. But your parents are still way
bigger douchebags than he thought.

746
00:55:01,997 --> 00:55:04,102
God. As soon as I get out
of this fucking hellhole,

747
00:55:04,103 --> 00:55:05,600
I'm going to call my parole officer.

748
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:20,982
Oh my God! It's him! Craig?

749
00:55:20,983 --> 00:55:22,984
Craig! No!

750
00:55:22,985 --> 00:55:24,889
I'm not fucking around!

751
00:55:26,889 --> 00:55:28,489
I know this is a trick!

752
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:29,958
Then why do you have a gun?

753
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:31,625
Because he's scared!

754
00:55:31,626 --> 00:55:35,461
Because he knows that this whole
fucking place is cursed!

755
00:55:35,462 --> 00:55:38,836
This place is not cursed! There
is no such thing as ghosts!

756
00:55:41,836 --> 00:55:43,445
Fuck!

757
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:27,019
Help! Matt! Matt!

758
00:56:31,019 --> 00:56:36,991
<i>they gave the last full measure
of devotion. That we here highly</i>

759
00:56:36,992 --> 00:56:38,627
It's the storm messing
with the lights.

760
00:56:39,027 --> 00:56:44,927
<i>Shall not have died in
vain that this nation under God.</i>

761
00:56:47,503 --> 00:56:51,039
I'm way more impressed with that
Hologram-o thingy now.

762
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:55,910
Holy shit! Can we get the
fuck out of here please?

763
00:56:55,911 --> 00:56:56,918
Mother fucker!

764
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:17,565
Whatever you are, whatever you
want, it wasn't me!

765
00:57:18,934 --> 00:57:21,502
Alright, You want revenge?!

766
00:57:21,503 --> 00:57:24,671
Go find my father! Go Kill him!

767
00:57:24,672 --> 00:57:28,152
He's the one that made the deal
with the school! Not me!

768
00:58:07,181 --> 00:58:11,121
Okay. You go find Tricia.
And I'll get Craig.

769
00:58:13,121 --> 00:58:14,260
Oh!

770
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:55,061
He fell, He fell down the steps!
He fell down the steps!

771
00:58:55,062 --> 00:58:56,298
You, you fucking killed him!

772
00:58:56,299 --> 00:59:01,301
No! He was shooting the gun. I
was trying to make him stop!

773
00:59:01,302 --> 00:59:05,707
No! Please! Stop!

774
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:09,176
Please! I'm fucking scared, man.

775
00:59:09,177 --> 00:59:15,150
Of what? Ghosts? Ghosts?
Are you kidding me?!

776
00:59:16,251 --> 00:59:20,255
The fucking scariest thing at
this school is you!

777
00:59:59,427 --> 01:00:00,427
Eeuuhh!

778
01:00:09,871 --> 01:00:15,771
Okay. Tricia took some pills
that she had she's less, Tricia.

779
01:00:17,913 --> 01:00:20,715
Good. 'Cause if I start
screaming, I don't need

780
01:00:20,716 --> 01:00:24,852
some crazy bitch screaming
over my screaming.

781
01:00:24,853 --> 01:00:29,122
You seem pretty chill now.

782
01:00:29,123 --> 01:00:31,125
Oh, no thanks!

783
01:00:31,126 --> 01:00:35,395
Sorry I blew your cover. I'm
just, freakin' out and

784
01:00:35,396 --> 01:00:36,897
Don't sweat it.

785
01:00:36,898 --> 01:00:40,201
Bad news travels fast
at Crestview.

786
01:00:40,202 --> 01:00:43,837
It took them a while to
kick you out.

787
01:00:43,838 --> 01:00:49,143
You know about those aptitude tests that
they give the students at Crestview?

788
01:00:49,144 --> 01:00:50,143
Twenty nine.

789
01:00:50,144 --> 01:00:51,279
Thirty five.

790
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,412
But, that's a perfect score.

791
01:00:52,413 --> 01:00:54,282
Yeah, I work on carburetors
and shit.

792
01:00:54,283 --> 01:00:55,317
Hmm.

793
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:58,291
And apparently, the school's average
needed a little help this year.

794
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:05,393
By the way, your name was not on
the detention list this morning.

795
01:01:05,394 --> 01:01:06,328
I thought

796
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,896
You thought you'd weasel your
way in here

797
01:01:08,897 --> 01:01:13,167
and give everyone the finger.
And then what?

798
01:01:13,168 --> 01:01:15,268
I don't know.

799
01:01:15,269 --> 01:01:19,741
I don't know. It was pretty
dumb, I guess.

800
01:01:19,742 --> 01:01:20,776
Yep.

801
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:25,312
Yeah not as dumb though
as ghosts and demons and

802
01:01:25,313 --> 01:01:27,814
Indian curses.

803
01:01:27,815 --> 01:01:33,787
But even if you don't believe in
ghosts and demons.

804
01:01:34,188 --> 01:01:35,823
Just be careful.

805
01:01:35,824 --> 01:01:40,928
Yeah, I'll make sure to keep any
accidents away from you.

806
01:01:40,929 --> 01:01:45,799
I didn't know Clarks possessed
such strong leadership skills.

807
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:49,470
Yeah. I must be rising to
the occasion.

808
01:01:49,471 --> 01:01:52,244
I know. I can feel it against
my thigh.

809
01:01:55,244 --> 01:02:00,214
Oh sorry. I hate those
fucking things.

810
01:02:00,215 --> 01:02:04,820
I'm just scared and well
you wanna fuck?

811
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:43,561
There's someone outside!
That's my mother's Town Car!

812
01:02:45,561 --> 01:02:47,562
It's the Janitor!

813
01:02:47,563 --> 01:02:48,895
Max?

814
01:02:48,896 --> 01:02:49,930
Yeah.

815
01:02:49,931 --> 01:02:51,000
Max! Max!

816
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,267
- Max!
- Max! Max!

817
01:02:54,268 --> 01:02:55,521
Max!

818
01:04:19,521 --> 01:04:20,492
Ahhhh.

819
01:04:41,543 --> 01:04:42,676
Dude.

820
01:04:42,677 --> 01:04:44,384
Wow, Jesus Fucking Christ!

821
01:05:25,186 --> 01:05:28,189
Thirty four.

822
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:29,689
Thirty four?

823
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:35,664
The entrance exam. I scored
thirty-four.

824
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:42,503
Well done. You like to work on
carburetors for fun, too?

825
01:05:43,204 --> 01:05:46,708
That's supposed to be funny,
right?! Because I don't even

826
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:52,614
know what a carburetor is! No
matter how hard I try,

827
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:58,451
my mother would never trust me
to do anything on my own.

828
01:05:58,452 --> 01:06:02,589
All those people who work for
her, she treats them like

829
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:07,060
property. She treats me the
same way.

830
01:06:07,061 --> 01:06:08,197
Where's Veronica?

831
01:06:08,198 --> 01:06:11,799
I begged my mother to let
Rainwater keep his house.

832
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,268
I told her I could graduate
without this fucking library.

833
01:06:14,269 --> 01:06:17,805
Tricia! Where's Veronica?!

834
01:06:17,806 --> 01:06:20,208
She just looked at me with
contempt.

835
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:21,808
You know what?

836
01:06:21,809 --> 01:06:25,079
You and your mom sound like the
exact same person to me.

837
01:06:44,065 --> 01:06:46,634
I have to leave, Matt.

838
01:06:46,635 --> 01:06:48,271
No problem, I got it.

839
01:06:50,271 --> 01:06:54,642
Hey! Could you um.

840
01:06:54,643 --> 01:06:55,576
No!

841
01:06:55,577 --> 01:06:58,712
No.
The paint bucket!

842
01:06:58,713 --> 01:07:02,722
Oh Uh, No!

843
01:07:08,722 --> 01:07:13,160
Tricia, these two are starting
to crack.

844
01:07:13,161 --> 01:07:15,229
No one knows dick.

845
01:07:15,230 --> 01:07:17,766
We're out of here in 6 months.
What's the problem?

846
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:21,701
Look! I got into Harvard by
myself. I don't need your

847
01:07:21,702 --> 01:07:25,539
parents' donation to Crestview.
Or my parents' donation.

848
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:28,308
Or my parents for that matter.

849
01:07:28,309 --> 01:07:32,745
Wow. And I thought
you were smart.

850
01:07:32,746 --> 01:07:36,152
But really you're
just opinionated.

851
01:07:37,152 --> 01:07:38,685
Thank you, Veronica.

852
01:07:38,686 --> 01:07:39,688
You know I was thinking

853
01:07:39,689 --> 01:07:42,790
Veronica. Office. Now!

854
01:07:42,791 --> 01:07:46,127
<i>Girls! Letters are here!</i>

855
01:07:46,128 --> 01:07:52,034
<i>Whooo! Whooo! Letter!!!!
Tricia! Come on!!</i>

856
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:54,701
Goodie! "Letters!"

857
01:07:54,702 --> 01:08:00,207
Because nothing is more fun
than spelling shit. Seriously.

858
01:08:00,208 --> 01:08:04,879
Guys! We say nothing.
We graduate. Go to college.

859
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:09,582
And move on with our kick ass
fucking lives. Got it?!

860
01:08:09,583 --> 01:08:12,919
<i>Letters! Everybody!
The Letters!!!</i>

861
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:18,896
You're "A" Darcy. "P" is for
you. There you go. And "E!"

862
01:08:22,796 --> 01:08:27,401
Claire is Captain, Tricia!
So she is always in the center.

863
01:08:27,402 --> 01:08:30,837
So she is always the big "C."

864
01:08:30,838 --> 01:08:34,742
Everyone knows you're an "H."

865
01:08:34,743 --> 01:08:36,942
I get my trust fund
after college.

866
01:08:36,943 --> 01:08:39,213
I don't need this coming back
to bite me on the ass.

867
01:08:39,214 --> 01:08:42,349
What do you want us to do?
Turn Tricia in?

868
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:45,418
I say we let Governor Wilkes do
what she does best:

869
01:08:45,419 --> 01:08:48,620
Take money. Throw it at a
problem. Make it go away.

870
01:08:48,621 --> 01:08:51,924
Or perhaps not. I heard her
mother kicked Tricia out.

871
01:08:51,925 --> 01:08:54,626
And doesn't want her coming back
home even after the election.

872
01:08:54,627 --> 01:08:56,965
Well, there you go. Even
"Attila the Hen" is sick

873
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:59,332
of Tricia's bullshit.

874
01:08:59,333 --> 01:09:03,938
We've got our "get out of jail
free card." Let's use it!

875
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:07,375
Fucking man up, Craig. It's not
like the cunt is going to

876
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:09,910
get the God damn electric chair.

877
01:09:09,911 --> 01:09:14,360
And with her gone, I can keep
you company this summer.

878
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:32,260
Look, I'm not going to take you
guys down with me.

879
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:38,340
Go get Headmaster Nash. I'll
tell him everything,

880
01:09:38,341 --> 01:09:41,774
and I'll clear your names.
It's my fucking mess.

881
01:09:41,775 --> 01:09:47,681
So I'll let my mother
deal with it.

882
01:09:48,382 --> 01:09:51,721
Go! Before I change my mind.

883
01:10:27,721 --> 01:10:33,673
Tricia! Drop those backpacks!

884
01:11:29,917 --> 01:11:33,786
It never stops with that kid.

885
01:11:33,787 --> 01:11:35,855
Hey!

886
01:11:35,856 --> 01:11:39,559
My office!

887
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:43,397
So, was it stress? Or maybe
you were possessed

888
01:11:43,398 --> 01:11:45,398
by a dead Indian? Or maybe

889
01:11:45,399 --> 01:11:49,870
maybe I'm lying? Is that it,
Tricia? Am I lying?!

890
01:11:49,871 --> 01:11:53,573
Why? You have a disc
of that too?

891
01:11:53,574 --> 01:11:57,377
Yes! I did. I fucking
dropped it.

892
01:11:57,378 --> 01:12:01,849
It doesn't even matter.
Who would believe you?

893
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:07,821
Who would believe one word you
say? This is my school.

894
01:12:08,422 --> 01:12:12,826
Everybody knows me.
And everybody loves me.

895
01:12:12,827 --> 01:12:14,962
They would be on my
side because they

896
01:12:14,963 --> 01:12:18,564
wouldn't know what
to do without me.

897
01:12:18,565 --> 01:12:24,538
It's called influence. It's
called power. You don't have

898
01:12:24,639 --> 01:12:27,408
enough of either for anyone
to believe you're right.

899
01:12:27,409 --> 01:12:32,014
I don't need to be right.
I just don't need to know you.

900
01:12:34,015 --> 01:12:35,985
Ahhh!

901
01:12:37,985 --> 01:12:41,153
You piece of shit!
Don't talk to me like that!

902
01:12:41,154 --> 01:12:44,192
You're undercrust!
Nobody talks to me like that!

903
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:45,893
Easy, Tricia!

904
01:12:45,894 --> 01:12:48,861
Don't tell me what to do!
Nobody tells me what to do!

905
01:12:48,862 --> 01:12:52,197
I'm not doing that. You can do
anything you want.

906
01:12:52,198 --> 01:12:54,034
You're God damn right, I can.

907
01:12:54,035 --> 01:12:59,038
ut Tricia if you kill him, it's
"Good bye, out-of-state college

908
01:12:59,039 --> 01:13:02,108
condo" and "Hello, mommy's
guest house."

909
01:13:02,109 --> 01:13:08,014
I mean, c'mon the scandal?
Your mom. Even if you

910
01:13:08,115 --> 01:13:11,020
were acquitted, she'd never
let you out of her sight again.

911
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:14,688
Which means no escape
from her and her

912
01:13:14,689 --> 01:13:16,993
Draconian parenting, right?

913
01:13:19,993 --> 01:13:25,938
That's it. Easy, Tricia.
You just won Apache Princess.

914
01:13:31,238 --> 01:13:36,643
One final "Fuck you!"
from Craig to Tricia.

915
01:13:36,644 --> 01:13:39,212
Looks like visiting hours
are over.

916
01:13:39,213 --> 01:13:43,149
For an Indian, he didn't put up
much of a fight.

917
01:13:43,150 --> 01:13:47,187
Owww! God-dammit!

918
01:13:47,188 --> 01:13:50,057
Careful, we don't want to leave
behind any physical evidence.

919
01:13:50,058 --> 01:13:52,192
God! Get that camera off of me!

920
01:13:52,193 --> 01:13:54,729
Craig, if that video ends up
on the Internet,

921
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:58,532
my mother's going to
be more than disappointed.

922
01:13:58,533 --> 01:14:03,069
Tricia! That scarf is cashmere!

923
01:14:03,070 --> 01:14:05,705
Guys. Guys. We've got to get
out of here right now.

924
01:14:05,706 --> 01:14:08,076
Okay? The cops will be
here any minute!

925
01:14:08,077 --> 01:14:10,943
We're screwed!

926
01:14:10,944 --> 01:14:14,251
C.C. Signing off from the
14th floor!

927
01:14:16,251 --> 01:14:19,051
Wow. And I thought

928
01:14:19,052 --> 01:14:21,588
Go ahead and do it. My mother's
going to cut your heart out.

929
01:14:21,589 --> 01:14:24,957
Considering this could sink her
whole battleship

930
01:14:24,958 --> 01:14:28,161
she might even put me on
the payroll!

931
01:14:28,162 --> 01:14:29,362
You know what?

932
01:14:29,363 --> 01:14:35,336
I should put one through that
tiny little heart of yours.

933
01:14:36,237 --> 01:14:39,076
Yes! Yes, you should.

934
01:14:42,076 --> 01:14:45,245
But she's not worth it.

935
01:14:45,246 --> 01:14:49,018
Your leadership mantras
really suck!

936
01:14:50,018 --> 01:14:52,317
Look. I think I know
how to get rid of this

937
01:14:52,318 --> 01:14:53,652
Native American wraith.

938
01:14:53,653 --> 01:14:55,122
Veronica. There are no ghosts.

939
01:14:55,123 --> 01:15:01,029
No. He's real. He didn't care
about the money.

940
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:03,664
He just wouldn't sell.

941
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:08,100
Look. I never held a
seance before.

942
01:15:08,101 --> 01:15:10,804
I mean not one that actually
worked.

943
01:15:10,805 --> 01:15:13,138
Okay, please. I know you think
this is all crap.

944
01:15:13,139 --> 01:15:16,610
But if this helps her from
freaking out, or acting like

945
01:15:16,611 --> 01:15:21,113
oh God, like I give a shit. But
I think this will help me.

946
01:15:21,114 --> 01:15:22,750
What do you say?

947
01:15:34,228 --> 01:15:36,831
This isn't going to work with
three people.

948
01:15:36,832 --> 01:15:41,201
It, uh should. I usually contact
my parents alone.

949
01:15:41,202 --> 01:15:43,201
Somebody else has to be the
medium this time.

950
01:15:43,202 --> 01:15:47,074
You brought the spirit in. You're
the one who must escort it out.

951
01:15:47,075 --> 01:15:49,776
I can't.
I'm the one who

952
01:15:49,777 --> 01:15:53,283
Tricia.
You have to do this.

953
01:15:56,283 --> 01:15:57,384
Fine.

954
01:15:57,385 --> 01:15:58,622
Join hands.

955
01:16:00,622 --> 01:16:01,555
And remember

956
01:16:01,556 --> 01:16:04,793
Don't break the fucking circle.
I got it!

957
01:16:06,793 --> 01:16:10,838
Jacob Rainwater,
are you here with us?

958
01:16:17,838 --> 01:16:20,706
Jacob.

959
01:16:20,707 --> 01:16:26,607
Please forgive me. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

960
01:16:32,119 --> 01:16:36,390
Jacob? It's time for you
to leave.

961
01:16:46,801 --> 01:16:48,255
Veronica?!

962
01:17:07,255 --> 01:17:09,902
Veronica?

963
01:17:20,902 --> 01:17:26,802
If you make it out of here alive
tell Tricia to go fuck herself.

964
01:17:43,190 --> 01:17:46,907
We need to get out of here.

965
01:17:59,907 --> 01:18:05,807
Tell me it's you. There is no
ghost. It's just you.

966
01:18:08,483 --> 01:18:14,383
Tricia. I didn't kill anybody.
I don't want to hurt you.

967
01:18:18,993 --> 01:18:22,899
I just want to get out of here.

968
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,444
Tricia.

969
01:19:11,444 --> 01:19:15,493
Tricia! hahahaha.

970
01:19:25,493 --> 01:19:27,055
Tricia.

971
01:20:29,055 --> 01:20:32,064
Ha ha ha ha ha!

972
01:20:37,064 --> 01:20:40,666
Come on! It's fucking
cold in here!

973
01:20:40,667 --> 01:20:43,340
Ugghhh. Gross!

974
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:48,917
Hello, Mr. Clark.

975
01:20:55,917 --> 01:20:58,518
Hmm. Wasn't he a Muslim?

976
01:20:58,519 --> 01:21:03,956
Well, Tarek may not have had
his father's drive to succeed,

977
01:21:03,957 --> 01:21:05,626
but he sure had his spunk.

978
01:21:05,627 --> 01:21:09,496
I wasn't expecting to see him
pop out of that vent.

979
01:21:09,497 --> 01:21:13,031
Last night Max almost found the
ghost setting up in here.

980
01:21:13,032 --> 01:21:15,934
Pshh, like I'm nervous the
'tard might catch me.

981
01:21:15,935 --> 01:21:17,704
Go make sure the 'tard isn't
lurking about,

982
01:21:17,705 --> 01:21:20,040
ready to come lumbering in.

983
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:21,543
Ugghhh.

984
01:21:23,543 --> 01:21:25,122
Hey, she's into older men.

985
01:21:36,122 --> 01:21:42,033
Man she really bought all these
ghosts and demons shit, huh?

986
01:21:45,733 --> 01:21:46,842
All Clear!

987
01:21:54,442 --> 01:21:57,477
May I have Craig's gun back?

988
01:21:57,478 --> 01:21:58,747
No.

989
01:21:59,747 --> 01:22:05,117
Giving students behavior and
personality tests, finding out

990
01:22:05,118 --> 01:22:10,156
what they will and won't respond
to is part of my job.

991
01:22:10,157 --> 01:22:15,228
Learning how to trigger
emotional outbursts is the perk.

992
01:22:15,229 --> 01:22:21,169
You, Mr. Clark, were of course,
a complete disappointment.

993
01:22:23,170 --> 01:22:27,107
Ah ah ah ah ah.

994
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:30,175
Boobs? Judas Priest?

995
01:22:30,176 --> 01:22:33,113
Although, I'm not sure Craig's
actually worked.

996
01:22:33,114 --> 01:22:36,515
I think he really hated
Tricia. Or loved her.

997
01:22:36,516 --> 01:22:38,584
There were supposed to be
five! I believe the

998
01:22:38,585 --> 01:22:42,187
office sent your uncle a letter,
Mr. Clark. School policy.

999
01:22:42,188 --> 01:22:45,559
I thought if Tricia saw this,
she'd finish you off.

1000
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:49,595
But she kind of choked.
So I had to get creative.

1001
01:22:49,596 --> 01:22:52,564
But, why?

1002
01:22:52,565 --> 01:22:57,269
Synopsis: A group of seemingly
normal, well adjusted,

1003
01:22:57,270 --> 01:23:01,474
well-to-do teenagers are killed
inside a cursed library

1004
01:23:01,475 --> 01:23:03,610
built on land that,
coincidently, all their parents

1005
01:23:03,611 --> 01:23:07,080
have insidious vocational ties
to.

1006
01:23:07,081 --> 01:23:10,083
Instant best seller. I mean,
the book, the movie,

1007
01:23:10,084 --> 01:23:14,586
the TV series... we'll make a
mint! I know.

1008
01:23:14,587 --> 01:23:18,625
The irony is crazy huge, right?
I mean, c'mon.

1009
01:23:18,626 --> 01:23:23,228
Are you really bummed that
they're all dead? Really?

1010
01:23:23,229 --> 01:23:25,234
Really?!?!?

1011
01:23:28,234 --> 01:23:33,676
This school, sucks.

1012
01:23:36,676 --> 01:23:40,247
I'm sorry Matt. But it just
makes sense. Somebody has

1013
01:23:40,248 --> 01:23:43,649
to be the psycho. And it's
perfect. You're new.

1014
01:23:43,650 --> 01:23:46,553
You're a felon. And
you know you're poor.

1015
01:23:46,554 --> 01:23:48,587
So, it's an easy sell.

1016
01:23:48,588 --> 01:23:52,291
I mean c'mon. You beat up
retarded kids.

1017
01:23:52,292 --> 01:23:53,460
He's not

1018
01:23:53,461 --> 01:23:57,563
Wait wait wait what did you do
to get thrown into Ju-Vee?

1019
01:23:57,564 --> 01:23:59,732
Go fuck yourself!

1020
01:23:59,733 --> 01:24:04,675
You're sexy. But money and fame
are a little sexier.

1021
01:24:12,246 --> 01:24:15,190
You think Paris or Lindsay
ever served detention?

1022
01:24:24,190 --> 01:24:30,130
What a bitch! She was supposed
to pretend to poison me.

1023
01:24:30,831 --> 01:24:34,300
I'm running around vomiting all
over the sidewalk,

1024
01:24:34,301 --> 01:24:37,904
switching lights and carnival sounds
off and on like a circus chimp.

1025
01:24:37,905 --> 01:24:41,177
Hiding from Max.
Chasing Tarek about.

1026
01:24:44,177 --> 01:24:49,618
It's really cold out there!

1027
01:24:51,618 --> 01:24:55,721
Some insurance against
spiteful parents who may not

1028
01:24:55,722 --> 01:24:58,791
approve of my new book.

1029
01:24:58,792 --> 01:25:01,862
Ahhh... There. Now we're good.

1030
01:25:05,365 --> 01:25:09,202
Oh, nice work, Max.

1031
01:25:09,203 --> 01:25:11,838
I guess the 'tard can do
something right.

1032
01:25:11,839 --> 01:25:14,208
Oh! I almost forgot!

1033
01:25:15,208 --> 01:25:16,777
<i>This is the Police department.</i>

1034
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:18,746
There! Now we're good.

1035
01:25:25,953 --> 01:25:29,923
Craig's gun still has one more
bullet left in it. Coincidence?

1036
01:25:29,924 --> 01:25:33,859
Or supernatural? You decide.

1037
01:25:33,860 --> 01:25:36,727
Please don't think ill of me.
I know the money, the fame,

1038
01:25:36,728 --> 01:25:39,934
will never cover the damage
these kids have done to others.

1039
01:25:39,935 --> 01:25:43,769
You see, I believe that a
certain amount of reparations

1040
01:25:43,770 --> 01:25:47,706
are overdue.
Long overdue.

1041
01:25:47,707 --> 01:25:51,381
These kids had to pay back what
they've been taking all these years!

1042
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:25,778
I expelled that miscreant days
ago. Why was he still here?

1043
01:26:25,779 --> 01:26:26,979
That's some bad kid.

1044
01:26:26,980 --> 01:26:30,883
In all my time as a teacher,
never have I seen a greater

1045
01:26:30,884 --> 01:26:34,687
blight on organized education
than Mr. Clark.

1046
01:26:34,688 --> 01:26:36,823
Like a massive gravity
sinkhole,

1047
01:26:36,824 --> 01:26:40,492
he deforms every positive
thought he encounters.

1048
01:26:40,493 --> 01:26:43,996
before sucking it into a
vortex from hell.

1049
01:26:43,997 --> 01:26:46,466
Well. Don't blame yourself,
Mister Nash.

1050
01:26:46,467 --> 01:26:49,436
Why would I?!?!?

1051
01:26:50,436 --> 01:26:53,407
Excuse me sir. I need you to
step away from the evidence.

1052
01:26:53,408 --> 01:26:55,441
Sorry, Officer.

1053
01:26:55,442 --> 01:26:56,441
What do yo got there?

1054
01:26:56,442 --> 01:26:59,279
What does that say?
Does that say Remington?

1055
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:01,346
Uhhh, Rainwater.

1056
01:27:01,347 --> 01:27:06,719
Jacob Rainwater. He was an
artist. A sculptor.

1057
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:10,723
Before this library was built,
this land was his home.

1058
01:27:10,724 --> 01:27:16,465
Until a man with an army
came and took it all away!

1059
01:27:18,465 --> 01:27:20,398
Mr. Rainwater, we're going to
need you to stay here

1060
01:27:20,399 --> 01:27:22,300
for a while right here. We're
probably going

1061
01:27:22,301 --> 01:27:23,770
to have some more
questions for you.

1062
01:27:23,771 --> 01:27:25,442
Yes, sir.

1063
01:27:28,442 --> 01:27:31,063
No! No!

1064
01:28:56,063 --> 01:28:59,399
And so there's nothing
more to discuss.
