00:01:54,117 --> 00:01:54,990
A bridge.

29
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,309
A bridge?

30
00:01:56,309 --> 00:01:56,838

00:01:56,838 --> 00:01:58,206

00:02:23,95 --> 00:02:27,37
La-la-la-la-la-la-la<br/>la-la-la-la-la-la-la

39
00:02:27,37 --> 00:02:28,309
B.I.

40
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:32,861
Love you, love you<br/>I love only you

41
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:37,837
I love you for my life<br/>La-la-la-la-la-la-la

42
00:02:37,837 --> 00:02:42,629

44
00:02:48,60 --> 00:02:49,727

00:02:49,727 --> 00:02:51,303
Mari and I

46
00:02:51,303 --> 00:02:57,135


47
00:02:57,135 --> 00:03:00,631
So Mari and I will be<br/>aired when?

48
00:03:00,631 --> 00:03:02,7
When will it be, Jinhwan?

49
00:03:02,7 --> 00:03:04,703
Is it tomorrow?<br/>Dec 16?

50
00:03:04,703 --> 00:03:05,887
Yes, it's tomorrow.

51
00:03:05,887 --> 00:03:08,919
Right.<br/>Tomorrow 10:50 pm.

52
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:12,655
Each of us will introduce<br/>ourselves on V app.

53
00:03:12,655 --> 00:03:13,519


54
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,327
On Wendesdays, at 10:50 pm,<br/>you'll see the love between

55
00:03:18,327 --> 00:03:23,175
humans and animals<br/>on Mari and I.

56
00:03:23,175 --> 00:03:26,599
I'm Kang-vely, Kang Ho-dong.

57
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,567


58
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:29,719
And who are you?

59
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:32,679
I'm Sim Hyung-tak.

60
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:36,980
I'm not sure<br/>what I'll do on the program.

61
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,356
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:38,356 --> 00:03:38,892


63
00:03:38,892 --> 00:03:40,652
But I'll do my best.

64
00:03:40,652 --> 00:03:42,92
It's okay.

65
00:03:42,92 --> 00:03:43,4
Hello.

66
00:03:43,4 --> 00:03:45,76
I'm Mari's mother Seo In Guk.

67
00:03:45,76 --> 00:03:46,196
Nice to meet you.

68
00:03:46,196 --> 00:03:46,916


69
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,68
And?

70
00:03:48,68 --> 00:03:52,380
I'm a toddler of entertainment,<br/>Jinwhan.

71
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,212
Wow, a toddler.

72
00:03:54,212 --> 00:03:54,420


73
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,756
Hey, Minjae.

74
00:03:55,756 --> 00:03:58,213
I'm Mari's father, Kim Min-jae.

75
00:03:58,213 --> 00:03:59,844


76
00:03:59,844 --> 00:04:02,708
I'm the expert of pets,<br/>Lee Jae-hoon.

77
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:02,964


78
00:04:02,964 --> 00:04:04,596
It was nice.

79
00:04:04,596 --> 00:04:07,316
I'm in charge of la-la-la.<br/>I'm B.I.

80
00:04:07,316 --> 00:04:08,52


81
00:04:08,52 --> 00:04:10,412
Why did we sing<br/>the song anyways?

82
00:04:10,412 --> 00:04:15,69
Last time, on V app,<br/>I sang this song

83
00:04:15,69 --> 00:04:18,653
for peace and union.

84
00:04:18,653 --> 00:04:21,380
And I sing it today again.

85
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,533
So many of you may not know

86
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:25,540
about our program.

87
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,716
So please explain.

88
00:04:26,716 --> 00:04:30,164
Mari is the unit<br/>to count animals in Korean.

89
00:04:30,164 --> 00:04:35,244
And we'll babysit pets.

90
00:04:35,244 --> 00:04:36,212
Right.

91
00:04:36,212 --> 00:04:37,540
So we're like animal sitters.

92
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,492
Pet sitters.

93
00:04:38,492 --> 00:04:41,332
Pet sitters.<br/>It's so warm and human.

94
00:04:41,332 --> 00:04:42,131


95
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:43,523
Where is Jiwon though?

96
00:04:43,523 --> 00:04:44,539
Here he is.

97
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:46,44
He's right here.

98
00:04:46,44 --> 00:04:46,476


99
00:04:46,476 --> 00:04:48,843
He's not here because of<br/>other schedule.

100
00:04:48,843 --> 00:04:50,715
It's okay, Jiwon.<br/>Come on here.

101
00:04:50,715 --> 00:04:54,3
- Come on.<br/>- So he's not here.

102
00:04:54,3 --> 00:04:55,132
Here he comes.

103
00:04:55,132 --> 00:04:56,251


104
00:04:56,251 --> 00:05:00,372
So it's being aired<br/>only domestically?

105
00:05:00,372 --> 00:05:00,771


106
00:05:00,771 --> 00:05:04,395
No. To those who're on<br/>V app right now.

107
00:05:04,395 --> 00:05:06,363
- All around the world.<br/>- Really?

108
00:05:06,363 --> 00:05:08,755
- What nationality are they?<br/>- What people?

109
00:05:08,755 --> 00:05:09,211


110
00:05:09,211 --> 00:05:13,196
You can read their real time<br/>reaction here.

111
00:05:13,196 --> 00:05:14,267


112
00:05:14,267 --> 00:05:21,60
There are English, Korean,

113
00:05:21,60 --> 00:05:21,371


114
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:22,436
and

115
00:05:22,436 --> 00:05:23,883
- English.<br/>- English.

116
00:05:23,883 --> 00:05:26,700
- Korean and<br/>- Chinese.

117
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,596
There are Chinese viewers, and

118
00:05:28,596 --> 00:05:28,955


119
00:05:28,955 --> 00:05:30,739
- Japanese too?<br/>- Korean language.

120
00:05:30,739 --> 00:05:31,891
Sure.

121
00:05:31,891 --> 00:05:34,443
So it's being aired globally.

122
00:05:34,443 --> 00:05:36,819
What's even better is<br/>there are subtitles

123
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:37,123


124
00:05:37,123 --> 00:05:41,916
to help the viewers abroad<br/>understand us real time.

125
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,203
Then can we say hello<br/>to our Chinese fans?

126
00:05:44,203 --> 00:05:47,308
You're studying the language<br/>recently. Go ahead.

127
00:05:47,308 --> 00:06:01,883


128
00:06:01,883 --> 00:06:04,691
Any of you can speak<br/>Japanese or English?

129
00:06:04,691 --> 00:06:05,692
I can speak Japanese.

130
00:06:05,692 --> 00:06:06,844
To Japanese viewers.

131
00:06:06,844 --> 00:06:17,952


132
00:06:17,952 --> 00:06:19,744
What did you say?

133
00:06:19,744 --> 00:06:21,168
Don't miss our show<br/>tomorrow.

134
00:06:21,168 --> 00:06:21,712


135
00:06:21,712 --> 00:06:26,928
I also said, our program is<br/>titled Mari and I,

136
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,192

137
00:06:29,192 --> 00:06:32,592
Then try English B.I.

138
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:33,368
In English?

139
00:06:33,368 --> 00:06:34,408
To those abroad.

140
00:06:34,408 --> 00:06:35,704
He was surprised.

141
00:06:35,704 --> 00:06:38,720


142
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,536
I'm not ready at all.

143
00:06:40,536 --> 00:06:46,936


144
00:06:46,936 --> 00:06:49,976
How about our lovely Minjae?

145
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,80
In Thai language?

146
00:06:52,80 --> 00:06:53,496


147
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,480
Hello everyone.

148
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,144


149
00:06:56,144 --> 00:06:58,32

00:07:01,40 --> 00:07:02,464
Please don't miss it.<br/>Thank you.

152
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,561
We promoted

153
00:07:04,561 --> 00:07:08,729
our show and ourselves on V app.

154
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:12,32
And we hope<br/>our viewers will share

00:07:12,32 --> 00:07:14,456
our happiness and emotions.

156
00:07:14,456 --> 00:07:15,248
Right.

157
00:07:15,248 --> 00:07:17,384
So let's contact our friends

158
00:07:17,384 --> 00:07:19,920

159
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,296

163
00:07:27,401 --> 00:07:30,241
But I'm not sure he'll take<br/>the call or not.

164
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,312


165
00:07:32,312 --> 00:07:33,929
Is it he or she?

166
00:07:33,929 --> 00:07:36,496


167
00:07:36,496 --> 00:07:37,472

Hello?

171
00:07:41,824 --> 00:07:43,480
Jongmin.

00:07:45,87 --> 00:07:45,768
Yes?

175
00:07:45,768 --> 00:07:47,733
What were you doing?

176
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,406
I just ate and I'm waiting.

177
00:07:50,406 --> 00:07:52,286
Ate with whom?

178
00:07:52,286 --> 00:07:53,437
With my family.

179
00:07:53,437 --> 00:07:54,597
Your family?

180
00:07:54,597 --> 00:07:58,46
You're being aired live<br/>on V app.

181
00:07:58,46 --> 00:08:00,149
Can you do a short interview<br/>for us?

182

00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:02,725

185
00:08:04,94 --> 00:08:06,109


186
00:08:06,109 --> 00:08:07,798
Is it Internet broadcasting?

187
00:08:07,798 --> 00:08:08,766


188
00:08:08,766 --> 00:08:12,406
Yes. It's being aired live.

189
00:08:12,406 --> 00:08:13,790
Being aired right now?

190
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:18,870
Yes. Have you raised any pet?

191
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,710
A pet?

192
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,286


193
00:08:21,286 --> 00:08:24,470
I don't.<br/>But my family does.

194
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,478
Then...

195
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:27,62
you're not living<br/>with your family?

196
00:08:27,62 --> 00:08:28,254


197
00:08:28,254 --> 00:08:31,351
If you have one,<br/>what do you want to raise?

198
00:08:31,351 --> 00:08:31,694


199
00:08:31,694 --> 00:08:32,942
If I have one?

200
00:08:32,942 --> 00:08:33,990
Yes.

201
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,750
But I don't.

202
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,951
I said 'If' you have one.

203
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,974


204
00:08:41,974 --> 00:08:43,558
It's live.

205
00:08:43,558 --> 00:08:47,582


206
00:08:47,582 --> 00:08:49,454
I've never thought about it.

207
00:08:49,454 --> 00:08:51,326
You're so resistent.

208
00:08:51,326 --> 00:08:55,550
Anyway, tomorrow<br/>on Dec 16.

209
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,678
Tomorrow?

210
00:08:56,678 --> 00:08:58,943
Yes.<br/>On Wednes day evening, 10:50.

211
00:08:58,943 --> 00:09:00,278
Yes.

212
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:04,566
It's on JTBC.<br/>And the title is Mari and I.

213
00:09:04,566 --> 00:09:05,982
I know it.<br/>I read the article.

214
00:09:05,982 --> 00:09:07,286
Did you?

215
00:09:07,286 --> 00:09:09,102
If you watch it,

216
00:09:09,102 --> 00:09:10,142
Yes.

217
00:09:10,142 --> 00:09:12,396
you'll want to raise

218
00:09:12,396 --> 00:09:14,389
a pet too.

219
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:14,844


220
00:09:14,844 --> 00:09:15,964
Really?

221
00:09:15,964 --> 00:09:17,636
When will it be aired?

222
00:09:17,636 --> 00:09:20,261
Wednesday evening<br/>10:15?

223
00:09:20,261 --> 00:09:20,636


224
00:09:20,636 --> 00:09:24,93
Alright. Turn on the TV<br/>from then and wait for us.

225
00:09:24,93 --> 00:09:25,884
Okay? It's JTBC.

226
00:09:25,884 --> 00:09:26,572


227
00:09:26,572 --> 00:09:29,109
The time is 10:50 pm, Jongmin.

228
00:09:29,109 --> 00:09:30,132
Is it?

229
00:09:30,132 --> 00:09:31,772
Yes.

230
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:35,636
Jongmin, it's Jaehoon and I know<br/>you're free tomorrow 10:50 pm.

231
00:09:35,636 --> 00:09:36,492
Tomorrow?

232
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:37,468
Yes.

233
00:09:37,468 --> 00:09:39,21
I've got a schedule.

234
00:09:39,21 --> 00:09:40,205
A schedule?

235
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:41,204
Yes.

236
00:09:41,204 --> 00:09:44,508
Then you should postpone it.

237
00:09:44,508 --> 00:09:46,444
I'll watch it later for sure.

238
00:09:46,444 --> 00:09:47,420
OK, OK.

239
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,860
So when will it be aired?

240
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,989
Wednesday evening 10:50.

241
00:09:54,989 --> 00:09:55,220


242
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,260
Do not miss it, everyone.

243
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,332
Please say it one more time.

244
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,156
Hello everyone.<br/>Mari and I will be aired

245
00:10:02,156 --> 00:10:04,356
on Wednesday evening<br/>10:50 pm.

246
00:10:04,356 --> 00:10:06,684
Please do not miss it.

247
00:10:06,684 --> 00:10:07,364


248
00:10:07,364 --> 00:10:11,404
And you should tell this<br/>to your friends

249
00:10:11,404 --> 00:10:13,589
at least to 3 people.

250
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:14,108


251
00:10:14,108 --> 00:10:15,958
Okay, I will.

252
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,590
To my family.

253
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,142
Not just them.

254
00:10:19,142 --> 00:10:19,646


255
00:10:19,646 --> 00:10:23,234
To 3 of your friends.

256
00:10:23,234 --> 00:10:25,628
- And please prove it.<br/>- Send us a picture.

257
00:10:25,628 --> 00:10:27,715


258
00:10:27,715 --> 00:10:29,291
How can I?

259
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:29,875


260
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,265
You've been better<br/>than I expected.

261
00:10:31,265 --> 00:10:32,890
Thank you Jongmin.

262
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,218


263
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,201
Jongmin.

264
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:37,218
Yes?

265
00:10:37,218 --> 00:10:38,834
I think this is it.

266
00:10:38,834 --> 00:10:40,250


267
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,482
Is it?

268
00:10:41,482 --> 00:10:44,626
Jongmin, thank you for<br/>being so kind

269
00:10:44,626 --> 00:10:46,642
to this unexpected call.

270
00:10:46,642 --> 00:10:48,58
No problem.<br/>Bye, bro.

271
00:10:48,58 --> 00:10:49,794
Good.<br/>You didn't say any bad words.

272
00:10:49,794 --> 00:10:50,809


273
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:52,458
Though it is live.

274
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:53,594
Thanks.

275
00:10:53,594 --> 00:10:55,58
Thanks. Bye.

276
00:10:55,58 --> 00:10:55,850
See you.

277
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,321
When it'll be aired?

278
00:10:57,321 --> 00:10:59,538
On Wednesday,<br/>at 10:50 pm.

279
00:10:59,538 --> 00:10:59,978


280
00:10:59,978 --> 00:11:01,394
On which channel?

281
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:02,201


282
00:11:02,201 --> 00:11:03,746
JTBC?

283
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,570


284
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,642
You don't sound confident.

285
00:11:05,642 --> 00:11:07,138
Thanks, Jongmin.

286
00:11:07,138 --> 00:11:08,394
No problem.

287
00:11:08,394 --> 00:11:09,106


288
00:11:09,106 --> 00:11:10,395
Thank you.

289
00:11:10,395 --> 00:11:10,666


290
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:11,786
It was good.

291
00:11:11,786 --> 00:11:13,490
Now, it's Hyung-tak's turn.

292
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,250
To his friend.

293
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,906


294
00:11:16,906 --> 00:11:18,98
Is he an actor?

295
00:11:18,98 --> 00:11:19,618
Yes, he is.

296
00:11:19,618 --> 00:11:20,18


297
00:11:20,18 --> 00:11:21,130
Hide the number.

298
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:21,970
Hello?

299
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,34
Hello.

300
00:11:23,34 --> 00:11:24,426
Yes, bro.

301
00:11:24,426 --> 00:11:25,985
I'm on air now.

302
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,98
Yes.

303
00:11:27,98 --> 00:11:29,434
And um...

304
00:11:29,434 --> 00:11:30,306


305
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:32,594
Tomorrow, at 10:15 pm...

306
00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:33,754
No, it's 50.

307
00:11:33,754 --> 00:11:35,602
Right. At 10:50 pm.

308
00:11:35,602 --> 00:11:36,530


309
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,642
To remind it one more.

310
00:11:38,642 --> 00:11:39,858
JTBC.

311
00:11:39,858 --> 00:11:40,946


312
00:11:40,946 --> 00:11:42,81
On JTBC, Wednesday<br/>at 10:50 pm.

313
00:11:42,81 --> 00:11:44,426
Right, Minjae.

314
00:11:44,426 --> 00:11:46,658
Are you calling next to him?

315
00:11:46,658 --> 00:11:47,442


316
00:11:47,442 --> 00:11:48,898
I was there for a short time.

317
00:11:48,898 --> 00:11:50,354
So will you watch it tomorrow?

318
00:11:50,354 --> 00:11:52,111
Sure. At home for sure.

319
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,151
Keep your promise, Minjae.

320
00:11:53,151 --> 00:11:53,679


321
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,552
Because you'll be there.

322
00:11:55,552 --> 00:11:57,424
Really?

323
00:11:57,424 --> 00:11:59,375


324
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:02,335
So I hope you'll watch it.

325
00:12:02,335 --> 00:12:03,431
Alright, bro.

326
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,175
And please<br/>tell your friends this.

327
00:12:06,175 --> 00:12:07,127
Okay.<br/>To more than 3.

328
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:08,455
Right. More than 3.

329
00:12:08,455 --> 00:12:10,143
Thank you for your time<br/>despite your busy schedules.

330
00:12:10,143 --> 00:12:10,975
Thank you too.

331
00:12:10,975 --> 00:12:12,87
Alright.

332
00:12:12,87 --> 00:12:13,807


333
00:12:13,807 --> 00:12:15,210
- Here you go.<br/>- What was it?

334
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,114


335
00:12:16,114 --> 00:12:17,594
And In Guk?

336
00:12:17,594 --> 00:12:17,906


337
00:12:17,906 --> 00:12:19,499
I'll call...

338
00:12:19,499 --> 00:12:20,938


339
00:12:20,938 --> 00:12:22,346
this one.

340
00:12:22,346 --> 00:12:28,546


341
00:12:28,546 --> 00:12:29,874
Who is it?

342
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,162


343
00:12:31,162 --> 00:12:32,778
It's a woman.

344
00:12:32,778 --> 00:12:36,397
Look out the window,<br/>See the snowflakes fall.

345
00:12:36,397 --> 00:12:38,628


346
00:12:38,628 --> 00:12:39,732
Hello?

347
00:12:39,732 --> 00:12:41,412
- It's a girl.<br/>- Hello.

348
00:12:41,412 --> 00:12:41,772


349
00:12:41,772 --> 00:12:42,611
Hello?

350
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:43,771
Hello.

351
00:12:43,771 --> 00:12:45,35
Yes.

352
00:12:45,35 --> 00:12:46,99
What are you doing?

353
00:12:46,99 --> 00:12:47,812
I'm just chilling.

354
00:12:47,812 --> 00:12:49,67
Now...

355
00:12:49,67 --> 00:12:50,43
Yes.

356
00:12:50,43 --> 00:12:51,683
I'm on air.

357
00:12:51,683 --> 00:12:52,67


358
00:12:52,67 --> 00:12:54,716
And nobody knows who you are.<br/>Will you introduce yourself?

359
00:12:54,716 --> 00:12:57,5
Hello.<br/>I'm Jang Nara.

360
00:12:57,5 --> 00:12:58,683


361
00:12:58,683 --> 00:12:59,746
Who?

362
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,115
Jang Nara. Jang Nara.

363
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:02,547
It's Jang Nara.

364
00:13:02,547 --> 00:13:03,891
Hello, I'm Lee Jae-hoon.

365
00:13:03,891 --> 00:13:06,403


366
00:13:06,403 --> 00:13:07,771
We're doing

367
00:13:07,771 --> 00:13:08,667
Yes.

368
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:13,572
a program on JTBC.<br/>It's called Mari and I.

369
00:13:13,572 --> 00:13:13,907


370
00:13:13,907 --> 00:13:15,851
We're calling our friends

371
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:17,372
to promote our program.

372
00:13:17,372 --> 00:13:18,859
Okay.

373
00:13:18,859 --> 00:13:20,411
It'll be aired...

374
00:13:20,411 --> 00:13:21,691
I know when.

375
00:13:21,691 --> 00:13:22,811
Do you?

376
00:13:22,811 --> 00:13:23,427
Yes.

377
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,667
When will it?

378
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:26,787
Tomorrow at 10:50 pm?

379
00:13:26,787 --> 00:13:27,963


380
00:13:27,963 --> 00:13:30,91
Wow.<br/>Unbelievable.

381
00:13:30,91 --> 00:13:31,51
I can't believe this.

382
00:13:31,51 --> 00:13:32,59
She loves pets so much.

383
00:13:32,59 --> 00:13:34,835
We're also fans of her.

384
00:13:34,835 --> 00:13:38,475


385
00:13:38,475 --> 00:13:40,328
Thank you. But I thought<br/>you just said Marijuana.

386
00:13:40,328 --> 00:13:40,536


387
00:13:40,536 --> 00:13:41,791
It's live.

388
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:44,23
Oh, I didn't told you.<br/>It's live.

389
00:13:44,23 --> 00:13:44,847
Oh, right.

390
00:13:44,847 --> 00:13:46,112
It's live.

391
00:13:46,112 --> 00:13:46,519


392
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:49,784
We can edit it<br/>when we upload it.

393
00:13:49,784 --> 00:13:50,287


394
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,351
But the pronunciation<br/>was confusing.

395
00:13:52,351 --> 00:13:54,839
Would you repeat it?<br/>Mari and I.

396
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:56,471
Mari and I.

397
00:13:56,471 --> 00:13:58,7
Good, good.

398
00:13:58,7 --> 00:14:00,128
Please don't miss it.

399
00:14:00,128 --> 00:14:00,616


400
00:14:00,616 --> 00:14:01,623
Sure.

401
00:14:01,623 --> 00:14:05,31
And please promote it<br/>to your friends too.

402
00:14:05,31 --> 00:14:06,815
Sure. I will.

403
00:14:06,815 --> 00:14:07,839
Congratulations.

404
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,839
And you love pets so much.

405
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,871
- I do.<br/>- Ask her if she can

406
00:14:11,871 --> 00:14:13,80
sing the song for us.

407
00:14:13,80 --> 00:14:14,367
She loves K-pop too.

408
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:16,935
Do you know iKon?

409
00:14:16,935 --> 00:14:17,863
Yes.

410
00:14:17,863 --> 00:14:20,151
Do you know their song<br/>My Type too?

411
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,191


412
00:14:21,191 --> 00:14:22,599
Sorry?

413
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:24,80
Do you know the song?

414
00:14:24,80 --> 00:14:24,311


415
00:14:24,311 --> 00:14:25,639
Do you know iKON?

416
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:26,879
Say hello.

417
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,775
Hello.

418
00:14:28,775 --> 00:14:30,72
Hello.

419
00:14:30,72 --> 00:14:31,271


420
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:35,952
My Type. My Type.

421
00:14:35,952 --> 00:14:37,279
Nice to meet you.

422
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:37,615


423
00:14:37,615 --> 00:14:39,368
We're iKON.

424
00:14:39,368 --> 00:14:39,719


425
00:14:39,719 --> 00:14:41,487
Hello.

426
00:14:41,487 --> 00:14:43,463
We want to see you.

427
00:14:43,463 --> 00:14:44,967
Okay. See you.

428
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,95
She's an angel.

429
00:14:47,95 --> 00:14:48,816
They're so energetic<br/>because they're newbies.

430
00:14:48,816 --> 00:14:49,815


431
00:14:49,815 --> 00:14:52,248
Thank you so much.

432
00:14:52,248 --> 00:14:53,663


433
00:14:53,663 --> 00:14:55,295
Good luck.

434
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:56,415
Thank you.

435
00:14:56,415 --> 00:14:57,783
- Alright. See you.<br/>- Thank you.

436
00:14:57,783 --> 00:14:59,32
Talk to you later.

437
00:14:59,32 --> 00:14:59,711


438
00:14:59,711 --> 00:15:01,239
Thank you.

439
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:01,631


440
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,967
She's the best.

441
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:04,896
She even knew our time.

442
00:15:04,896 --> 00:15:05,127


443
00:15:05,127 --> 00:15:07,471
That was so kind.

444
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:08,792
How does she know that?

445
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:09,199


446
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,119
And it's Minjae's turn.

447
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,527
I will...

448
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:14,48
Don't call Hyung-tak.

449
00:15:14,48 --> 00:15:15,815


450
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:17,823
I think he was planning to.

451
00:15:17,823 --> 00:15:18,231


452
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:21,620
You look you would.

453
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,794


454
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:27,522
He might not get it.

455
00:15:27,522 --> 00:15:28,306


456
00:15:28,306 --> 00:15:30,354
Hello?

457
00:15:30,354 --> 00:15:32,362


458
00:15:32,362 --> 00:15:34,355
What were you doing?

459
00:15:34,355 --> 00:15:36,467
I just came from toilet.

460
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:36,802


461
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:39,130
Toilet?

462
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,595
And now I'm in a waiting room.

463
00:15:40,595 --> 00:15:40,842


464
00:15:40,842 --> 00:15:42,210
Are you shooting something?

465
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,282
Who is this?

466
00:15:43,282 --> 00:15:45,450
I was at Open Concert.

467
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,675
Who is this?

468
00:15:46,675 --> 00:15:46,946


469
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,98
Hide the number.

470
00:15:48,98 --> 00:15:50,986
Open Concert for<br/>middle-aged people.

471
00:15:50,986 --> 00:15:51,858
Isn't he?

472
00:15:51,858 --> 00:15:53,858
- We're now on V app...<br/>- Is there someone else?

473
00:15:53,858 --> 00:15:55,290
I'm with some others.

474
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:58,11
I'm on a live show on V app.

475
00:15:58,11 --> 00:15:58,234


476
00:15:58,234 --> 00:15:59,370
Alright.

477
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:03,498
And they don't know who you are.<br/>Please introduce yourself.

478
00:16:03,498 --> 00:16:04,850
Hello everyone.

479
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:08,530
I'm Roy Kim.

480
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,235
Roy Kim.

481
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:10,490


482
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:11,602
I didn't know it.

483
00:16:11,602 --> 00:16:12,858
Hello?<br/>Whom are you with, Minjae?

484
00:16:12,858 --> 00:16:15,306
I'm with Hodong, Jaehoon,

485
00:16:15,306 --> 00:16:17,474
Hyung-tak, In Guk,

486
00:16:17,474 --> 00:16:20,202
B.I of iKON, and Jinhwan.

487
00:16:20,202 --> 00:16:21,554
Huh?

488
00:16:21,554 --> 00:16:23,674
Roy, it's me In Guk.

489
00:16:23,674 --> 00:16:24,906
Oh, hi.

490
00:16:24,906 --> 00:16:29,252
People all around the world<br/>heard you just went to toilet.

491
00:16:29,252 --> 00:16:30,821
I've got a stomachache.

492
00:16:30,821 --> 00:16:32,861


493
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:34,556
Now, that too...

494
00:16:34,556 --> 00:16:36,388
be heard by all the people.

495
00:16:36,388 --> 00:16:38,524
It's okay.<br/>How have you been?

496
00:16:38,524 --> 00:16:40,212
Roy Kim got a stomachache.

497
00:16:40,212 --> 00:16:43,453
We're doing a program<br/>called Mari and I on JTBC.

498
00:16:43,453 --> 00:16:44,652
Right.

499
00:16:44,652 --> 00:16:46,20
Do you know that?

500
00:16:46,20 --> 00:16:48,172
I know. Oh...

501
00:16:48,172 --> 00:16:50,892
That's why you're with them.

502
00:16:50,892 --> 00:16:52,108


503
00:16:52,108 --> 00:16:55,628
There'll be lots of animals and<br/>we'll communicate with them.

504
00:16:55,628 --> 00:16:57,372
That's a great program.

505
00:16:57,372 --> 00:16:59,468
Tomorrow, at 10:50 pm.

506
00:16:59,468 --> 00:17:02,116
Your fans all around the world

507
00:17:02,116 --> 00:17:04,68
now wants to hear your song,

508
00:17:04,68 --> 00:17:06,332
Roy Kim.

509
00:17:06,332 --> 00:17:07,884
My latest song is good.

510
00:17:07,884 --> 00:17:10,444
Could you sing for us?

511
00:17:10,444 --> 00:17:10,676


512
00:17:10,676 --> 00:17:12,60
Sure I can.

513
00:17:12,60 --> 00:17:14,85
Two, three, four.

514
00:17:14,85 --> 00:17:15,412


515
00:17:15,412 --> 00:17:18,579
Can you see the Cassiopeia?

516
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,652
I hope you'll be waiting for me<br/>for long

517
00:17:22,652 --> 00:17:25,116
with the twinkling stars<br/>in the sky

518
00:17:25,116 --> 00:17:26,540
That's it.

519
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:26,788


520
00:17:26,788 --> 00:17:30,596
You just heard the sick<br/>Roy Kim's song.

521
00:17:30,596 --> 00:17:32,692
And they reacted like,

522
00:17:32,692 --> 00:17:35,437
Good luck to your<br/>bowel movement.

523
00:17:35,437 --> 00:17:35,724


524
00:17:35,724 --> 00:17:38,212
So many good comments.

525
00:17:38,212 --> 00:17:40,436
They're worride about you<br/>so much.

526
00:17:40,436 --> 00:17:41,892
I feel so good.

527
00:17:41,892 --> 00:17:43,116
There's a mission though.

528
00:17:43,116 --> 00:17:44,388
What's that?

529
00:17:44,388 --> 00:17:45,908
You have to tell about<br/>our program

530
00:17:45,908 --> 00:17:48,92
to at least 3 of your friends.

531
00:17:48,92 --> 00:17:48,908
Is that it?

532
00:17:48,908 --> 00:17:50,20
Yes.

533
00:17:50,20 --> 00:17:51,388
What's the reward for me?

534
00:17:51,388 --> 00:17:54,156


535
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,52
Happiness.

536
00:17:55,52 --> 00:17:57,476
An exemption from<br/>Hodong's punch.

537
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,92


538
00:17:59,92 --> 00:18:02,77
He'll be where you're.<br/>Just give us your address.

539
00:18:02,77 --> 00:18:03,589


540
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:06,396
I'll tell it<br/>to 5 friends of mine.

541
00:18:06,396 --> 00:18:08,412


542
00:18:08,412 --> 00:18:10,388
Thank you.

543
00:18:10,388 --> 00:18:12,277
When is it aired?

544
00:18:12,277 --> 00:18:12,532


545
00:18:12,532 --> 00:18:15,476
Tomorrow<br/>at 10:50 pm?

546
00:18:15,476 --> 00:18:15,972


547
00:18:15,972 --> 00:18:17,901
On which channel?

548
00:18:17,901 --> 00:18:19,316


549
00:18:19,316 --> 00:18:20,989
JTBC?

550
00:18:20,989 --> 00:18:21,868


551
00:18:21,868 --> 00:18:23,949
Do not miss it.

552
00:18:23,949 --> 00:18:25,244
Alright.<br/>Thank you.

553
00:18:25,244 --> 00:18:26,860
Thank you.

554
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,100


555
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,380
- Thank you.<br/>- Talk to you later.

556
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,684
He's so sweet.

557
00:18:31,684 --> 00:18:34,548
No one was panicked<br/>at our calls.

558
00:18:34,548 --> 00:18:37,460
No one yet.

559
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:41,796
Like we discussed it before.

560
00:18:41,796 --> 00:18:42,500


561
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,956
Roy even told us<br/>he just went to toilet.

562
00:18:44,956 --> 00:18:46,668
It can't be planned.

563
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:49,413
Shall I call some special one?

564
00:18:49,413 --> 00:18:50,548


565
00:18:50,548 --> 00:18:52,60
Sure.

566
00:18:52,60 --> 00:18:53,420
Go, Jinhwan.

567
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,76
It's my first time to call him.

568
00:18:56,76 --> 00:18:56,964
Really?

569
00:18:56,964 --> 00:18:58,500
- First call?<br/>- Is he a singer?

570
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,108
- For our program.<br/>- To help promote

571
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:02,750
our program.

572
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:10,404


573
00:19:10,404 --> 00:19:11,684
Great.

574
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:13,245
I can't believe this.

575
00:19:13,245 --> 00:19:16,228


576
00:19:16,228 --> 00:19:17,932
- Really?<br/>- Will he take it?

577
00:19:17,932 --> 00:19:20,326
I really hope he'll take it.

578
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:20,676


579
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:22,868
Hello.

580
00:19:22,868 --> 00:19:23,908
Hello.

581
00:19:23,908 --> 00:19:24,980
Hello?

582
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,324
Hello?

583
00:19:26,324 --> 00:19:28,60
Yes, Jinhwan.

584
00:19:28,60 --> 00:19:29,508
It's my first call.

585
00:19:29,508 --> 00:19:30,628


586
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,228
Right.

587
00:19:32,228 --> 00:19:33,684
So awkward.

588
00:19:33,684 --> 00:19:37,260
I'm on V app.

589
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:37,580


590
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,820
Okay.

591
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,820
Our program called Mari and I<br/>will be aired tomorrow.

592
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,988
Okay.

593
00:19:43,988 --> 00:19:48,301
I'm really sorry, but can you<br/>introduce our program?

594
00:19:48,301 --> 00:19:48,892


595
00:19:48,892 --> 00:19:50,668
How?

596
00:19:50,668 --> 00:19:52,28
I will introduce you.

597
00:19:52,28 --> 00:19:55,364
Here's Seung Ri of Big Bang.

598
00:19:55,364 --> 00:19:57,404


599
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:01,52
And I'm here with Hodong

600
00:20:01,52 --> 00:20:02,196
Okay.

601
00:20:02,196 --> 00:20:05,116
Jaehoon, Hyung-tak,

602
00:20:05,116 --> 00:20:07,766
In Guk, Minjae,

603
00:20:07,766 --> 00:20:10,750
and B.I.

604
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,374
- But when...<br/>- Hey, Seung Ri.

605
00:20:14,374 --> 00:20:16,85
Hello, Hodong.

606
00:20:16,85 --> 00:20:17,629
What are you doing now?

607
00:20:17,629 --> 00:20:19,878
Do you have time for this call?

608
00:20:19,878 --> 00:20:21,285


609
00:20:21,285 --> 00:20:25,470
I'm in the US now.

610
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,78
We're on vacation now.

611
00:20:28,78 --> 00:20:29,686


612
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:33,477
So Big Bang's in the US?

613
00:20:33,477 --> 00:20:36,462
We're all in<br/>different countries.

614
00:20:36,462 --> 00:20:39,742
Then you won't be able to<br/>watch our program

615
00:20:39,742 --> 00:20:42,110
tomorrow?

616
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,486


617
00:20:43,486 --> 00:20:47,318
I will on my lap top.

618
00:20:47,318 --> 00:20:48,486
Good.

619
00:20:48,486 --> 00:20:49,389
Great. You can.

620
00:20:49,389 --> 00:20:51,247
- When can he...<br/>- How are you Hodong?

621
00:20:51,247 --> 00:20:51,918


622
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:52,982
He just asked that.

623
00:20:52,982 --> 00:20:55,182
I've been good, Seung Ri.

624
00:20:55,182 --> 00:20:56,485
So good.

625
00:20:56,485 --> 00:20:58,93
How about you?

626
00:20:58,93 --> 00:21:00,142
I'm missing you so much.<br/>Really.

627
00:21:00,142 --> 00:21:01,693
Me too.

628
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:04,558
You're so different now.

629
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:07,478
Don't be so sweet to me.<br/>It's so awkward.

630
00:21:07,478 --> 00:21:08,549


631
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:10,854
- See you next time.<br/>- I'll be there.

632
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:13,574
When you have time

633
00:21:13,574 --> 00:21:17,998
please be on our program.

634
00:21:17,998 --> 00:21:18,973


635
00:21:18,973 --> 00:21:20,597
Sure. I promise.<br/>Thank you.

636
00:21:20,597 --> 00:21:23,262
Thank you so much for your time.

637
00:21:23,262 --> 00:21:23,917


638
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:25,494
Jinhwan.

639
00:21:25,494 --> 00:21:27,677
Yes, bro.

640
00:21:27,677 --> 00:21:32,78
You and B.I. should be<br/>good with Hodong.

641
00:21:32,78 --> 00:21:32,902


642
00:21:32,902 --> 00:21:34,93
We'll do our best.

643
00:21:34,93 --> 00:21:36,86
He's so reasonable.

644
00:21:36,86 --> 00:21:37,397


645
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:38,686
Alright.

646
00:21:38,686 --> 00:21:41,518
He tell those good<br/>from who aren't.

647
00:21:41,518 --> 00:21:42,429


648
00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:43,789
We'll do our best.

649
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:45,78
Anyways.

650
00:21:45,78 --> 00:21:47,213
Ask him if he was good or not.

651
00:21:47,213 --> 00:21:48,967
If he was good or bad.

652
00:21:48,967 --> 00:21:51,846
How were you?

653
00:21:51,846 --> 00:21:52,925


654
00:21:52,925 --> 00:21:57,765
I was so good that<br/>I even could sit on his lap.

655
00:21:57,765 --> 00:21:59,414
Right...

656
00:21:59,414 --> 00:22:01,429


657
00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:05,391
I was sitting on his lap.

658
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:05,630


659
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:06,958
I remember that.

660
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,678
I'll do that too.

661
00:22:09,678 --> 00:22:10,765


662
00:22:10,765 --> 00:22:13,853
I hope iKON will be also able to<br/>sit on his lap

663
00:22:13,853 --> 00:22:16,622
and get his compliment.

664
00:22:16,622 --> 00:22:18,414
Alright.

665
00:22:18,414 --> 00:22:20,846
Thank you.<br/>And ask him to say

666
00:22:20,846 --> 00:22:22,693
please do not miss<br/>Mari and I.

667
00:22:22,693 --> 00:22:25,726
It'll be aired tomorrow<br/>at 10:50 pm.

668
00:22:25,726 --> 00:22:26,421


669
00:22:26,421 --> 00:22:27,589
Yes.

670
00:22:27,589 --> 00:22:29,942
So please promote it.

671
00:22:29,942 --> 00:22:31,302
Thank you.

672
00:22:31,302 --> 00:22:32,973
Is it on KBS?

673
00:22:32,973 --> 00:22:35,134
- No, it's on JTBC.<br/>- JTBC.

674
00:22:35,134 --> 00:22:37,997
Oh, is it?<br/>I'm sorry.

675
00:22:37,997 --> 00:22:40,190
It's on JTBC, at 10:50 pm.

676
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,189


677
00:22:41,189 --> 00:22:43,342
Thank you.

678
00:22:43,342 --> 00:22:44,478


679
00:22:44,478 --> 00:22:47,989
Besides our program,<br/>I hope you and Jinwhan

680
00:22:47,989 --> 00:22:50,374
will be closer.

681
00:22:50,374 --> 00:22:54,109
Jinhwan is sweating too much.

682
00:22:54,109 --> 00:22:56,446
Why are you, Jinhwan?

683
00:22:56,446 --> 00:22:59,326
Don't be so nervous.

684
00:22:59,326 --> 00:23:00,253


685
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:03,133
You sweat too much.

686
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:04,966
I'll call you more often.

687
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:05,837
Really?

688
00:23:05,837 --> 00:23:08,949
I want to tell you something.

689
00:23:08,949 --> 00:23:13,333
The most friendly person to iKON<br/>from Big Bang

690
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:16,181
is me.

691
00:23:16,181 --> 00:23:18,229
Right?

692
00:23:18,229 --> 00:23:18,885
Right.

693
00:23:18,885 --> 00:23:19,717
I see.

694
00:23:19,717 --> 00:23:25,406
And I know you're having<br/>a hard time now.

695
00:23:25,406 --> 00:23:29,702
So I'm encouraging them.

696
00:23:29,702 --> 00:23:31,790
It's okay to make mistakes.

697
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:35,454
And that's my job

698
00:23:35,454 --> 00:23:37,543
to encourage and support them.

699
00:23:37,543 --> 00:23:38,405


700
00:23:38,405 --> 00:23:40,590
So I think<br/>we need to meet up more often.

701
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,469
Alright.

702
00:23:41,469 --> 00:23:42,848
Why are you so calm, B.I?

703
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,525


704
00:23:43,525 --> 00:23:45,375
Hello.<br/>It's me B.I.

705
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:46,253


706
00:23:46,253 --> 00:23:49,278
Why do you say hello now?

707
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:50,342


708
00:23:50,342 --> 00:23:53,325
I'm sorry.

709
00:23:53,325 --> 00:23:56,62
I missed my moment

710
00:23:56,62 --> 00:23:57,862
to say hello.

711
00:23:57,862 --> 00:23:58,253


712
00:23:58,253 --> 00:23:59,582
Be humble.

713
00:23:59,582 --> 00:24:00,285


714
00:24:00,285 --> 00:24:01,525
I'm always.

715
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:02,525
Please be humble.

716
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:04,245
I know.

717
00:24:04,245 --> 00:24:05,69
And...

718
00:24:05,69 --> 00:24:07,214
Then I'll see you later.

719
00:24:07,214 --> 00:24:09,54
I'm doing something.

720
00:24:09,54 --> 00:24:09,565


721
00:24:09,565 --> 00:24:12,717
Yes.

722
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:15,367
Mari and I will be aired on JTBC

723
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:15,894


724
00:24:15,894 --> 00:24:18,390
at 10:30 pm.

725
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,54
Where are the other 20 mins?

726
00:24:20,54 --> 00:24:21,942
Please don't miss the program.

727
00:24:21,942 --> 00:24:22,709


728
00:24:22,709 --> 00:24:27,743
And YG's newbie,<br/>Big Bang's...

729
00:24:27,743 --> 00:24:29,605


730
00:24:29,605 --> 00:24:33,638
with you. Thank you.

731
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,550


732
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,910
We'll talk to you later.

733
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:38,277


734
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:40,966
Thank you Jinhwan.<br/>Be a good boy.

735
00:24:40,966 --> 00:24:42,422
Alright?<br/>Be humble.

736
00:24:42,422 --> 00:24:43,886
Okay.<br/>Don't miss our program.

737
00:24:43,886 --> 00:24:44,974
You're sweating like...

738
00:24:44,974 --> 00:24:45,766
Okay.<br/>Cheer up.

739
00:24:45,766 --> 00:24:47,173
- Thank you.<br/>- Good luck.

740
00:24:47,173 --> 00:24:48,541
Thank you, Hodong.

741
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:49,878
Thank you Seung Ri.

742
00:24:49,878 --> 00:24:50,525


743
00:24:50,525 --> 00:24:55,407
Jinhwan is sweating like rain.

744
00:24:55,407 --> 00:24:56,69


745
00:24:56,69 --> 00:25:00,878
I think iKON really repects you.

746
00:25:00,878 --> 00:25:02,830


747
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,75
Support them please.

748
00:25:05,75 --> 00:25:06,90
At your service.

749
00:25:06,90 --> 00:25:07,594
Thank you so much.

750
00:25:07,594 --> 00:25:08,233


751
00:25:08,233 --> 00:25:09,617
Thank you.

752
00:25:09,617 --> 00:25:10,737
Go, Seung Ri.

753
00:25:10,737 --> 00:25:11,817
Go.

754
00:25:11,817 --> 00:25:13,630
Thank you.

755
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,75


756
00:25:15,75 --> 00:25:16,235
I could really

757
00:25:16,235 --> 00:25:19,45
feel his love for you.

758
00:25:19,45 --> 00:25:19,555


759
00:25:19,555 --> 00:25:22,341
I think you should visit him<br/>in the US right away.

760
00:25:22,341 --> 00:25:23,947


761
00:25:23,947 --> 00:25:25,589
You're like right after<br/>a performance.

762
00:25:25,589 --> 00:25:25,890


763
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:28,117
- So exhausted.<br/>- Right.

764
00:25:28,117 --> 00:25:28,979


765
00:25:28,979 --> 00:25:30,909
You look like you just had<br/>a concert.

766
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:31,571


767
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,403
After using up all your energy.

768
00:25:33,403 --> 00:25:35,195
And finally, it's B.I's turn.

769
00:25:35,195 --> 00:25:36,397
I'll...

770
00:25:36,397 --> 00:25:37,291


771
00:25:37,291 --> 00:25:38,875
I'm so expecting.

772
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:40,491
You have to sweat a lot too.

773
00:25:40,491 --> 00:25:44,77
But I'm a bit closer to him.

774
00:25:44,77 --> 00:25:47,899


775
00:25:47,899 --> 00:25:49,99
Anyway, we talked with Seung Ri.

776
00:25:49,99 --> 00:25:50,235
Right.<br/>Even he's in the US.

777
00:25:50,235 --> 00:25:51,766
None of us failed yet.

778
00:25:51,766 --> 00:25:53,500


779
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,123
Like we planned in advance.

780
00:25:55,123 --> 00:25:56,343
Exactly.

781
00:25:56,343 --> 00:25:58,619


782
00:25:58,619 --> 00:25:59,867
What happened to your mobile?

783
00:25:59,867 --> 00:26:01,723
Is it iKON thing?

784
00:26:01,723 --> 00:26:03,187
It's the best one.

785
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:03,794


786
00:26:03,794 --> 00:26:04,967
He should take it.

787
00:26:04,967 --> 00:26:05,799
Who is it?

788
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:06,952
Hello.

789
00:26:06,952 --> 00:26:07,959
Hello.

790
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:08,870
Hello.

791
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,991
Hello, it's Hanbin.<br/>You know me.

792
00:26:10,991 --> 00:26:12,287
I already know who he is.

793
00:26:12,287 --> 00:26:14,319
Sure. I've got your number.

794
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:17,828
I'm on V app now.

795
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:19,445
Really?

796
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:20,60


797
00:26:20,60 --> 00:26:23,669
So no slangs, bro.

798
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:24,492
Sorry?

799
00:26:24,492 --> 00:26:26,540
No slangs, bro.

800
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,166
I shouldn't say any slsangs now?

801
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:32,709


802
00:26:32,709 --> 00:26:36,950
I'm okay with that,<br/>but right now,

803
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:37,245


804
00:26:37,245 --> 00:26:41,845
there's DJ Tukutz, a.k.a.<br/>Kim Jeong sik is next to me.

805
00:26:41,845 --> 00:26:43,572
Really?

806
00:26:43,572 --> 00:26:45,500
Why you're not calling me?

807
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,868
Hello.

808
00:26:46,868 --> 00:26:49,997
He's Tablo of Epik High.

809
00:26:49,997 --> 00:26:51,260


810
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:55,385
We'll do a program called<br/>Mari and I.

811
00:26:55,385 --> 00:26:56,399


812
00:26:56,399 --> 00:26:59,503
It's on JTBC.

813
00:26:59,503 --> 00:27:01,559
Alright.

814
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,895
And we're promoting it now.

815
00:27:03,895 --> 00:27:05,103
What?

816
00:27:05,103 --> 00:27:06,567
What's the name again?

817
00:27:06,567 --> 00:27:08,735
Mari and I.

818
00:27:08,735 --> 00:27:09,959


819
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:11,151
Who is Mari?

820
00:27:11,151 --> 00:27:13,455
We're with pets, and<br/>Mari is like

821
00:27:13,455 --> 00:27:14,599
when we're counting

822
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,623
animals.

823
00:27:16,623 --> 00:27:18,647
Like puppies?

824
00:27:18,647 --> 00:27:20,159
Right.

825
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,888
I knew it.

826
00:27:21,888 --> 00:27:22,327


827
00:27:22,327 --> 00:27:26,552
And it'll be first aired<br/>tomorrow at 10:50 pm.

828
00:27:26,552 --> 00:27:28,599


829
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:30,488
It's applaud.<br/>Thank you.

830
00:27:30,488 --> 00:27:31,191
Hanbin.

831
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,39
Yes.

832
00:27:32,39 --> 00:27:32,951
Are you a regular?

833
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:34,911
Yes, I and Jinhwan.

834
00:27:34,911 --> 00:27:36,55
Oh, really?

835
00:27:36,55 --> 00:27:38,287
Yes.<br/>Hodon's here too.

836
00:27:38,287 --> 00:27:40,984
Hello, Hodong.

837
00:27:40,984 --> 00:27:41,248


838
00:27:41,248 --> 00:27:42,767
It's been a while.

839
00:27:42,767 --> 00:27:44,647
How have you been?

840
00:27:44,647 --> 00:27:47,407
I'm so well, bro.

841
00:27:47,407 --> 00:27:48,815
Yes?

842
00:27:48,815 --> 00:27:50,783
How's Hanbin?

843
00:27:50,783 --> 00:27:52,511
He's so good,

844
00:27:52,511 --> 00:27:54,264
and now,

845
00:27:54,264 --> 00:27:55,15


846
00:27:55,15 --> 00:27:57,720
iKON and Hodong are united.

847
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,295


848
00:28:00,295 --> 00:28:01,413
Then what's it called?

849
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:03,259


850
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:04,924
iDong?

851
00:28:04,924 --> 00:28:05,900


852
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,276
Let's put it aside now.

853
00:28:08,276 --> 00:28:09,347


854
00:28:09,347 --> 00:28:12,252
So iKON is family of<br/>Mari and I.

855
00:28:12,252 --> 00:28:13,972
and you should promote<br/>the program

856
00:28:13,972 --> 00:28:16,325
to all the people<br/>around the world.

857
00:28:16,325 --> 00:28:17,964


858
00:28:17,964 --> 00:28:21,787
It's needless to say that<br/>iKON will be

859
00:28:21,787 --> 00:28:24,772
an icon of this generation.

860
00:28:24,772 --> 00:28:26,451


861
00:28:26,451 --> 00:28:32,188
And among them, especially,<br/>Hanbin and Jinhwan are the

862
00:28:32,188 --> 00:28:33,915


863
00:28:33,915 --> 00:28:38,190
funniest two.<br/>Trust them.

864
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:38,587


865
00:28:38,587 --> 00:28:40,755
And since when Jinwhan has<br/>respected Seung Ri

866
00:28:40,755 --> 00:28:43,36
so much?

867
00:28:43,36 --> 00:28:43,883


868
00:28:43,883 --> 00:28:44,771
Like how much?

869
00:28:44,771 --> 00:28:46,699
Seung Ri.

870
00:28:46,699 --> 00:28:48,515
Seung Ri of Big Bang?

871
00:28:48,515 --> 00:28:51,916
Yes. Jinwhan sweated like<br/>2L when he talked with him.

872
00:28:51,916 --> 00:28:52,683


873
00:28:52,683 --> 00:28:55,556
I've never heard of it.

874
00:28:55,556 --> 00:28:56,987


875
00:28:56,987 --> 00:28:59,860
Alright. It's okay.

876
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,452


877
00:29:00,452 --> 00:29:02,299
Anyways, Blo,

878
00:29:02,299 --> 00:29:06,988
have you ever raised a pet?

879
00:29:06,988 --> 00:29:08,275


880
00:29:08,275 --> 00:29:10,859
We have. But I'm not sure<br/>if iKON has.

881
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:14,83
They don't have, I think.

882
00:29:14,83 --> 00:29:19,27
What kind of pet do you like?

883
00:29:19,27 --> 00:29:20,851
What animal?

884
00:29:20,851 --> 00:29:28,627
I like puppies.

885
00:29:28,627 --> 00:29:32,851
And I love cats too.

886
00:29:32,851 --> 00:29:35,683
And I'm in to hedgehogs lately.

887
00:29:35,683 --> 00:29:37,699
They are so cute.

888
00:29:37,699 --> 00:29:40,332
Why do you like them?

889
00:29:40,332 --> 00:29:40,627


890
00:29:40,627 --> 00:29:42,851
They're sharp.

891
00:29:42,851 --> 00:29:44,107
Oh.

892
00:29:44,107 --> 00:29:45,883
That's why.

893
00:29:45,883 --> 00:29:51,267
Then please be on our program<br/>next time

894
00:29:51,267 --> 00:29:54,915
with your hedgehog.

895
00:29:54,915 --> 00:29:57,611
Show us how much you love him.

896
00:29:57,611 --> 00:30:00,915
We'll be there<br/>whenever you want us.

897
00:30:00,915 --> 00:30:02,675
Thank you for your time.

898
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,291
And I really mean it.

899
00:30:04,291 --> 00:30:05,851
When you have time,<br/>please be with us

900
00:30:05,851 --> 00:30:09,83
and have some good time<br/>with your pet and iKON.

901
00:30:09,83 --> 00:30:10,27
Alright.

902
00:30:10,27 --> 00:30:15,260
We'll shout out the name<br/>to support your program.

903
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:15,675


904
00:30:15,675 --> 00:30:19,316
Mari and I.

905
00:30:19,316 --> 00:30:20,259


906
00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:22,547
We really thank you.

907
00:30:22,547 --> 00:30:23,491
Thank you.

908
00:30:23,491 --> 00:30:24,659
Thank you.

909
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:25,579
Thank you, bro.

910
00:30:25,579 --> 00:30:26,451
Go.

911
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:27,724
Thank you. Let's go.

912
00:30:27,724 --> 00:30:28,979


913
00:30:28,979 --> 00:30:30,932
No failure.

914
00:30:30,932 --> 00:30:33,579


915
00:30:33,579 --> 00:30:36,356
I just texted him, and...

916
00:30:36,356 --> 00:30:38,539
But before that,

917
00:30:38,539 --> 00:30:41,479
our staffs told me that

918
00:30:41,479 --> 00:30:44,957
- Nara just posted something.<br/>- On her social network?

919
00:30:44,957 --> 00:30:48,901
Like this.

920
00:30:48,901 --> 00:30:50,117
That's what I've got.

921
00:30:50,117 --> 00:30:51,109
It means a lot.

922
00:30:51,109 --> 00:30:52,517
Thank you.

923
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,661
I think Jongmin's also willing<br/>to, but he doesn't know how.

924
00:30:55,661 --> 00:30:57,901
He's enthusiastic,<br/>but ignorant.

925
00:30:57,901 --> 00:31:00,205
He's so willing to help you

926
00:31:00,205 --> 00:31:01,965
but he doesn't know how to.

927
00:31:01,965 --> 00:31:02,757
So difficult.

928
00:31:02,757 --> 00:31:04,142
Nara is the best.

929
00:31:04,142 --> 00:31:04,821


930
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,893
Jongmin's the best too.

931
00:31:06,893 --> 00:31:08,333


932
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,784
I'll try this one.

933
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,777
He's also very bad at<br/>such things.

934
00:31:11,777 --> 00:31:16,752


935
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:21,17
Now, Jaehoon's calling<br/>his friend.

936
00:31:21,17 --> 00:31:23,360


937
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,57
I don't think he's taking it.

938
00:31:25,57 --> 00:31:25,776
Hello.

939
00:31:25,776 --> 00:31:26,921
Hey.

940
00:31:26,921 --> 00:31:27,343


941
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:29,640
What are you doing?

942
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,776
I'm home.

943
00:31:30,776 --> 00:31:34,456
Are you?<br/>Do you know V app?

944
00:31:34,456 --> 00:31:36,552
It's a Internet broadcasting<br/>channel.

945
00:31:36,552 --> 00:31:38,448
And we're live.

946
00:31:38,448 --> 00:31:39,208
On the Internet?

947
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:40,688
Yes.

948
00:31:40,688 --> 00:31:42,585
Should I watch it now then?

949
00:31:42,585 --> 00:31:43,592


950
00:31:43,592 --> 00:31:45,400
Before that,

951
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,680
please introduce yourself

952
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,849
to us.

953
00:31:49,849 --> 00:31:50,424


954
00:31:50,424 --> 00:31:51,776
Myself?

955
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:53,320
Yes please.

956
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,905
Do you think will it be okay?

957
00:31:56,905 --> 00:31:57,760


958
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,297
It's okay.

959
00:32:00,297 --> 00:32:01,208


960
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:07,817
Hello. I'm Bae Seong woo.

961
00:32:07,817 --> 00:32:09,584


962
00:32:09,584 --> 00:32:13,64
Not your real name.<br/>Your name for TV.

963
00:32:13,64 --> 00:32:14,56
Mr. Bae.

964
00:32:14,56 --> 00:32:15,512
Oh, my broadcasting name?

965
00:32:15,512 --> 00:32:18,32
It's Peter these days.

966
00:32:18,32 --> 00:32:19,200
Peter?

967
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,395
Just tell us your<br/>famous name.

968
00:32:23,395 --> 00:32:25,244
Oh, the famous one.

969
00:32:25,244 --> 00:32:25,579


970
00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:27,244
I'm Tak Jae hoon.

971
00:32:27,244 --> 00:32:29,507


972
00:32:29,507 --> 00:32:31,51
It's him.

973
00:32:31,51 --> 00:32:33,315
We're now

974
00:32:33,315 --> 00:32:34,763
Someone else's there?

975
00:32:34,763 --> 00:32:35,755
It's quite noisy.

976
00:32:35,755 --> 00:32:38,628
We're being aired now.

977
00:32:38,628 --> 00:32:39,211


978
00:32:39,211 --> 00:32:43,3
And at 10:50 pm tomorrow,

979
00:32:43,3 --> 00:32:45,91
Yes?

980
00:32:45,91 --> 00:32:46,692
Where should I be?

981
00:32:46,692 --> 00:32:47,195


982
00:32:47,195 --> 00:32:48,259
You should

983
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:49,955
sit in front of TV.

984
00:32:49,955 --> 00:32:53,915
And turn on JTBC.<br/>And from 10:50 pm

985
00:32:53,915 --> 00:32:58,491
Mari and I will be aired<br/>for the first time.

986
00:32:58,491 --> 00:33:00,947
Mari and I?

987
00:33:00,947 --> 00:33:01,499
JTBC?

988
00:33:01,499 --> 00:33:02,635
Congratulations.

989
00:33:02,635 --> 00:33:04,196
For the first time?

990
00:33:04,196 --> 00:33:05,51


991
00:33:05,51 --> 00:33:07,707
Please support us.

992
00:33:07,707 --> 00:33:11,108
How could you choose me<br/>to support you?

993
00:33:11,108 --> 00:33:11,571


994
00:33:11,571 --> 00:33:13,748
I'm not sure<br/>if it's good or not.

995
00:33:13,748 --> 00:33:14,939


996
00:33:14,939 --> 00:33:18,196
Congratulations on your start.

997
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:18,883


998
00:33:18,883 --> 00:33:21,243
And I think many things are<br/>changing

999
00:33:21,243 --> 00:33:22,595
in the broadcasting.

1000
00:33:22,595 --> 00:33:27,451
So I hope this kind of shows

1001
00:33:27,451 --> 00:33:28,860
will prosper.

1002
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,940
Hey, Jaehoon.

1003
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,499


1004
00:33:31,499 --> 00:33:32,507
Who's this?

1005
00:33:32,507 --> 00:33:33,883
It's me. Hodong.

1006
00:33:33,883 --> 00:33:35,715
Why are you there?

1007
00:33:35,715 --> 00:33:39,732
I'm also doing this program too.

1008
00:33:39,732 --> 00:33:40,83


1009
00:33:40,83 --> 00:33:41,155
Really?

1010
00:33:41,155 --> 00:33:42,899
I'm an animal in this program.

1011
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:45,171
I know you're a busy man.

1012
00:33:45,171 --> 00:33:48,883
But I'm feeling good because

1013
00:33:48,883 --> 00:33:52,387
while we're talking with you<br/>on the phone, our live show

1014
00:33:52,387 --> 00:33:55,940
got more than 1 million hearts.

1015
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,851


1016
00:33:56,851 --> 00:33:58,443
Really?

1017
00:33:58,443 --> 00:33:59,771
The hearts?

1018
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:01,635
Right. The hearts of love.

1019
00:34:01,635 --> 00:34:04,772
Is it heart?<br/>Not star balloons?

1020
00:34:04,772 --> 00:34:06,675


1021
00:34:06,675 --> 00:34:08,252
Hearts cost nothing.

1022
00:34:08,252 --> 00:34:08,811


1023
00:34:08,811 --> 00:34:11,900
And I know you love pets.

1024
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,451
And you're now raising one.

1025
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:14,643
Right.

1026
00:34:14,643 --> 00:34:18,3
If you have some occasions of

1027
00:34:18,3 --> 00:34:20,51
leaving your pets to others,

1028
00:34:20,51 --> 00:34:22,587
we'll take care of your pet

1029
00:34:22,587 --> 00:34:25,723
with much of love and care.

1030
00:34:25,723 --> 00:34:27,539
I see.

1031
00:34:27,539 --> 00:34:29,683
And how about saying something

1032
00:34:29,683 --> 00:34:31,699
to our viewers?

1033
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:36,475
When you can't stay<br/>with your pet

1034
00:34:36,475 --> 00:34:39,219
for some reasons,

1035
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:42,476
just let us know.<br/>Then we'll take care of it.

1036
00:34:42,476 --> 00:34:43,635


1037
00:34:43,635 --> 00:34:46,475
Like a hotel

1038
00:34:46,475 --> 00:34:48,355
of puppies?

1039
00:34:48,355 --> 00:34:49,418
Exactly.

1040
00:34:49,418 --> 00:34:51,210
We'll be pet sitters.

1041
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,812
Alright.

1042
00:34:52,812 --> 00:34:57,51
Isn't it assuring<br/>to let your pet

1043
00:34:57,51 --> 00:34:59,499
be with us?

1044
00:34:59,499 --> 00:35:02,955
Not really.<br/>Because I know you're all

1045
00:35:02,955 --> 00:35:04,804
too busy to care my pet.

1046
00:35:04,804 --> 00:35:07,699


1047
00:35:07,699 --> 00:35:10,77
You and Jaehoon,

1048
00:35:10,77 --> 00:35:11,307


1049
00:35:11,307 --> 00:35:12,907
all are so busy.

1050
00:35:12,907 --> 00:35:15,851
But it's my honor

1051
00:35:15,851 --> 00:35:17,870
if you'll take care of

1052
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:20,438
my pet.

1053
00:35:20,438 --> 00:35:21,806
Not at all.

1054
00:35:21,806 --> 00:35:24,470
I think you should watch us

1055
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:27,454
on tomorrow's episode<br/>at 10:50 pm.

1056
00:35:27,454 --> 00:35:33,102
Here's Mr. Shim Hyung-tak too.

1057
00:35:33,102 --> 00:35:35,678
Hello.<br/>We've met before.

1058
00:35:35,678 --> 00:35:37,358
Right. We've met before.

1059
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:39,182
And it was...

1060
00:35:39,182 --> 00:35:40,37


1061
00:35:40,37 --> 00:35:41,654
You do that too?

1062
00:35:41,654 --> 00:35:43,838
Yes. I'm trying my best.

1063
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:45,38
Congratulations.

1064
00:35:45,38 --> 00:35:46,718
I'm sorry.

1065
00:35:46,718 --> 00:35:48,591
Why are you sorry?

1066
00:35:48,591 --> 00:35:49,238


1067
00:35:49,238 --> 00:35:51,990
Here's In Guk too.

1068
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:54,46
Hello.<br/>I'm Seo In Guk.

1069
00:35:54,46 --> 00:35:55,709
Right. I know you.

1070
00:35:55,709 --> 00:35:58,61
It's been so long.

1071
00:35:58,61 --> 00:35:59,768
Yes. I'm seeing you on TV.

1072
00:35:59,768 --> 00:36:00,896
Thank you.

1073
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,216
And here's Minjae.

1074
00:36:02,216 --> 00:36:04,57
Why Hyung-tak is sorry though?

1075
00:36:04,57 --> 00:36:05,632


1076
00:36:05,632 --> 00:36:07,705
I haven't contacted you a lot.

1077
00:36:07,705 --> 00:36:10,426
You shouldn't be sorry.<br/>I'm worse.

1078
00:36:10,426 --> 00:36:13,63


1079
00:36:13,63 --> 00:36:16,102
If you're sorry for that,<br/>I should die.

1080
00:36:16,102 --> 00:36:17,714
I'm sorry.

1081
00:36:17,714 --> 00:36:18,23


1082
00:36:18,23 --> 00:36:19,711
And here's iKON

1083
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:20,894
and Minjae.

1084
00:36:20,894 --> 00:36:22,199
Hello. We're newbies.

1085
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:24,63
- We're iKON.<br/>- Nice to meet you.

1086
00:36:24,63 --> 00:36:27,577
Nice to meet you.<br/>We really want to see you.

1087
00:36:27,577 --> 00:36:27,799


1088
00:36:27,799 --> 00:36:30,966
I'm not sure<br/>if I can talk friendly

1089
00:36:30,966 --> 00:36:33,431
because they're so many people

1090
00:36:33,431 --> 00:36:35,15
who are close to me.

1091
00:36:35,15 --> 00:36:36,263
It's okay to talk friendly.

1092
00:36:36,263 --> 00:36:37,567
We're way too younger.

1093
00:36:37,567 --> 00:36:39,103
Really?

1094
00:36:39,103 --> 00:36:40,247
Nice to meet you anyway.

1095
00:36:40,247 --> 00:36:41,327
Nice to meet you.

1096
00:36:41,327 --> 00:36:43,760
So what time tomorrow?

1097
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,175


1098
00:36:44,175 --> 00:36:47,39
10:50 pm.

1099
00:36:47,39 --> 00:36:50,17
And the title is?

1100
00:36:50,17 --> 00:36:50,351


1101
00:36:50,351 --> 00:36:53,775
The title?<br/>Mari and I?

1102
00:36:53,775 --> 00:36:55,527
Yes. Mari and I.

1103
00:36:55,527 --> 00:36:58,527
Please don't miss it.

1104
00:36:58,527 --> 00:37:00,975
I was so happy.<br/>I thought you wanted to meet me.

1105
00:37:00,975 --> 00:37:03,447
But it wasn't.

1106
00:37:03,447 --> 00:37:03,999


1107
00:37:03,999 --> 00:37:06,143
Please watch us tomorrow.

1108
00:37:06,143 --> 00:37:07,639
Okay. I will.

1109
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:09,729
- Thank you.<br/>- Thank you.

1110
00:37:09,729 --> 00:37:12,494


1111
00:37:12,494 --> 00:37:16,239
It was Tak Jae hoon.<br/>It's so nice to hear him.

1112
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:20,327
So we called our friends

1113
00:37:20,327 --> 00:37:22,144
to promote our program.

1114
00:37:22,144 --> 00:37:24,263
And now

1115
00:37:24,263 --> 00:37:27,481
iKON's B.I and Jinhwan...

1116
00:37:27,481 --> 00:37:28,144


1117
00:37:28,144 --> 00:37:29,702
it's so upcoming.

1118
00:37:29,702 --> 00:37:31,239
It's tomorrow evening.

1119
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:33,663
So please wrap this up

1120
00:37:33,663 --> 00:37:35,281
by saying don't miss it.

1121
00:37:35,281 --> 00:37:36,223


1122
00:37:36,223 --> 00:37:40,191
Mari and I will be aired<br/>on JTBC at 10:50 pm.

1123
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:42,343
We hope many of you will

1124
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,695
enjoy it a lot.

1125
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:45,9
Thank you. Let's go.

1126
00:37:45,9 --> 00:37:46,409


1127
00:37:46,409 --> 00:37:47,111
La-la-la-la

1128
00:37:47,111 --> 00:37:48,559
1, 2, 3, 4.

1129
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:53,6
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la<br/>La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

1130
00:37:53,6 --> 00:37:58,65
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la<br/>La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

1131
00:37:58,65 --> 00:37:59,359


1132
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:00,845
Mari and I.

1133
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:05,845
