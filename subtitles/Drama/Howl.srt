1
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,109
"Howl" for Carl Solomon.

2
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:30,480
I saw the best minds of my generation

3
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:32,750
destroyed by madness,

4
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:36,754
starving hysterical naked,

5
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:40,355
dragging themselves through
the negro streets at dawn

6
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,627
Iooking for an angry fix,

7
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,770
angel-headed hipsters burning

8
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:49,136
for the ancient heavenly
connection to the starry dynamo

9
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,175
in the machinery of night,

10
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:53,910
who poverty and tatters and

11
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,912
hollow-eyed and high

12
00:01:56,049 --> 00:02:00,782
sat up smoking in the supernatural
darkness of cold-water flats

13
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,118
floating across the tops of
cities contemplating jazz!

14
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,406
Someti mes I feel i n
command when I'm writi ng.

15
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:15,378
When I'm in the heat of
some truthful tears, yes.

16
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:18,513
Other times... most of the time, not.

17
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:22,253
You know, just diddling around...

18
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,955
woodcarving, you know,
finding a pretty shape,

19
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,725
Iike most of my poetry.

20
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:32,797
There's only been a few times
when I've reached a state of...

21
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,998
complete control...

22
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,107
Probably a piece of "Howl," and...

23
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,906
one or two moments in other poems.

24
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:48,950
The beginning of the fear for me was

25
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:54,058
what would my father think of
something that I would write.

26
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,824
At the time, writing "Howl,"

27
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:58,486
I assumed when writing it that

28
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,962
it was not something
that would be published,

29
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:01,088
because...

30
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:05,000
I wouldn't want my daddy
to see what was in there.

31
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,470
So, I assumed it wouldn't be
published, therefore, I could

32
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,074
write anything that I wanted to.

33
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,931
I saw the best minds of my generation

34
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,967
destroyed by madness,

35
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,798
starving hysterical naked,

36
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:17,105
dragging themselves through
the negro streets at dawn

37
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,677
Iooking for an angry fix,

38
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,610
angel-headed hipsters

39
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:27,447
burning for the ancient
heavenly connection

40
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:30,681
to the starry dynamo in
the machinery of night,

41
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,992
who poverty and tatters

42
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,063
and hollow-eyed and high

43
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:40,631
sat up smoking in the
supernatural darkness

44
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,758
of cold-water flats

45
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:47,236
floating across the tops of
cities, contemplating jazz,

46
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:52,300
who passed through universities
with radiant cool eyes

47
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,208
hallucinating Arkansas and

48
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:58,113
BIake-Iight tragedy
among the scholars of war,

49
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:02,081
who were expelled from
the academies for crazy

50
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:06,157
& publishing obscene odes
on the windows of the skull,

51
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:09,822
who cowered in unshaven
rooms in underwear,

52
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,089
burning their money in wastebaskets

53
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:15,257
and Iistening to the
Terror through the wall,

54
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:18,193
who got busted in their pubic beards

55
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:22,330
returning through Laredo with a
belt of marijuana for New York,

56
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,467
who ate fire in paint hotels or drank

57
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,273
turpentine in Paradise AIIey,

58
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:29,711
death

59
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:33,979
or purgatoried their torsos
night after night with dreams,

60
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,918
with drugs, with waking nightmares,

61
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:41,652
alcohol and cock and endless balls,

62
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,134
What I wanted to read i nto
the record, Your Honor, is

63
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:56,503
not very much, but it
is pertinent to our case.

64
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,736
Why aren't you at the trial?

65
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,109
'Cause...

66
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,716
the trial's not about me.

67
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:08,415
As much as I have to thank them

68
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,545
completely for my fame...

69
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,056
It's the publisher, Lawrence
Ferlinghetti that was

70
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:15,956
busted for selling

71
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,063
obscene materials.

72
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:22,930
What I want to show is on the
first page inside of "Howl."

73
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:26,698
It says, "All these books
are published in Heaven."

74
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:28,065
And...

75
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:31,104
I don't quite understand
that, but anyway,

76
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,438
Iet the record show, Your Honor,

77
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:35,376
it's published by the City
Lights Pocketbook Shop.

78
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,644
Mr. Ferlinghetti could
go to jail if convicted?

79
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:41,218
I hope not. That would be terrible.

80
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,574
May I have your name, please?

81
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,038
Gail Potter.

82
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,647
And have you done any writing yourself?

83
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,443
Yes, I have done considerable.

84
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:15,680
I was on an NBC station for
10 years while I was teaching.

85
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,717
I was community service director,

86
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,586
educational coordinator...

87
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,787
I have rewritten "Faust."

88
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,362
It took me three years
to do that, but I did it.

89
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,055
I rewrote "Everyman."

90
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,201
That isn't as funny as you might think.

91
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,166
Pardon me, madam.

92
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,362
Ladies and gentlemen,

93
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,564
this is a trial that
involves serious issues.

94
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,265
Now kindly accord the witness

95
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,967
the courtesy you would
want to be accorded.

96
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:38,701
Alright.

97
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:41,972
And did you form an opinion as
to whether or not the book called

98
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:46,016
"Howl and OOther Poems"
has any literary merit?

99
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,619
I think it has no literary merit.

100
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:53,750
Go ahead.

101
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,088
In order to have literary
style, you must have

102
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:59,425
form, diction, fluidity, clarity.

103
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,897
Now, I am speaking only of style.

104
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,366
And in content, every
great piece of literature,

105
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:08,269
anything that can really be
classified as literature, is...

106
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:09,499
of some moral greatness,

107
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,837
and I think this fails
to the nth degree.

108
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,334
I see.

109
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,379
Can you think of any other reasons?

110
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:16,344
Yes...

111
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:17,642
Use of language.

112
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,445
In regards to the
figures of speech he uses,

113
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:21,610
he fails in rhetoric, of course,

114
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:24,018
for one thing, because
his figures of speech are

115
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,784
crude, and you feel like you
are going through the gutter

116
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,723
when you read that stuff.

117
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:31,825
I didn't linger on
it long, I assure you.

118
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,193
You may cross-examine.

119
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,400
Step down.

120
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:42,240
There's something more you want?

121
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:43,939
Step down.

122
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,069
Mr. Ehrlich doesn't
want to cross-examine.

123
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,113
You're through with me?

124
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:50,415
Step down.

125
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,651
What is "The Beat Generation"?

126
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:59,284
There is no Beat Generation.

127
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:03,352
It's just a bunch of guys,
trying to get published.

128
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:09,460
Why don't you tell me how
you started writing poetry?

129
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,964
I started writing poetry
because I was a dope,

130
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,638
and my father wrote poetry.

131
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:21,710
So I began writing rhymes like him.

132
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,915
And then I went to Columbia
University and I fell in love

133
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,015
with Jack Kerouac.

134
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,568
Until I was 18, I was a virgin.

135
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,430
I was unable to reach
out to anybody's body.

136
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,735
To reach out to desire.

137
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,172
I just felt...

138
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,277
Chained.

139
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,952
Jack gave me permission to open up.

140
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,282
He's a romantic poet.

141
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,618
And he taught me that
writing is personal,

142
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,161
that it comes from the
writer's own person.

143
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,121
His body,

144
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:14,064
his breathing rhythm,

145
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,491
his actual talk.

146
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:22,298
Eventually I developed a much
deeper sense of confession.

147
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:23,999
I needed to...

148
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:28,512
express my feelings to him,
but he didn't want to hear them.

149
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:31,707
So I had to find a new
way of expressing them...

150
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,113
a way that would entrance him.

151
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,689
This is good here.

152
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:40,986
"l was offered refreshments
which I accepted.

153
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,890
"l ate a sandwich of pure meat.

154
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,258
"Enormous sandwich of
human flesh, I noticed,

155
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:46,796
"while I was chewing on it.

156
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,059
"lt also included a dirty asshole! "

157
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,424
That's good!

158
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,997
That's good! The meat and the asshole.

159
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:54,834
Allen, alright.

160
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:58,068
And then I realized that if I actually

161
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:02,745
admitted and confessed
the secret tenderness

162
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,077
of my soul in my writing,

163
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:08,209
he would understand
nakedly who I was. And so...

164
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:11,414
that sincere talk replaced the earlier

165
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:14,822
imitative rhyming that I
was doing for my father.

166
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:21,090
Jack was the first person I
really opened up to and said,

167
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,762
"I'm a homosexual."

168
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:30,832
I very soon realized that nobody
was really shocked by anything.

169
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:34,005
Unless you're out
murdering people, you know,

170
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:38,974
People would never really be shocked by

171
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,143
an expression of feeling.

172
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,817
Really I wrote "Howl" for Jack.

173
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:55,123
who chained themselves to
subways for the endless ride

174
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:58,293
from Battery to holy Bronx on benzedrine

175
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:02,200
until the noise of wheels
and children brought them down

176
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,868
shuddering mouth-wracked
and battered bleak of brain

177
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:10,573
all drained of brilliance
in the drear Iight of Zoo,

178
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:13,046
Who talked continuously 70 hours

179
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:16,154
from park to pad to bar to Bellevue

180
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:18,848
to museum to the Brooklyn Bridge,

181
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,390
A Iost battalion of
platonic conversationalists

182
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,054
jumping down the stoops,

183
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,361
off fire escapes, off windowsills,

184
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,025
off Empire State,

185
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,899
out of the moon,

186
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:38,637
yacketayakking screaming vomiting

187
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:42,304
whispering facts and
memories and anecdotes and

188
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:47,385
eyeball kicks and shocks of
hospitals and jails and wars

189
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:54,590
who Iit cigarettes in
boxcars boxcars boxcars

190
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:59,562
racketing through snow toward
Ionesome farms in grand-father night

191
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:03,259
who studied PIotinus Poe
St, John of the Cross,

192
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,732
telepathy and bop kabbalah

193
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:10,467
because the cosmos instinctively
vibrated at their feet in IKansas,

194
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,501
who Ioned it through
the streets of Idaho

195
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:16,080
seeking visionary Indian angels

196
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:19,241
who were visionary Indian angels,

197
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:23,015
who jumped in Iimousines
with the Chinaman of Oklahoma

198
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:27,751
on the impulse of winter midnight
streetlight small-town rain,

199
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,054
who reappeared on the West Coast

200
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:34,859
investigating the FBI
in beards and shorts

201
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,230
with big pacifist eyes

202
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,303
sexy in their dark skin

203
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,896
passing out incomprehensible Ieaflets,

204
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:46,771
who burned cigarette holes in their arms

205
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:50,746
protesting the narcotic
tobacco haze of Capitalism,

206
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:57,316
who distributed Super-Communist
pamphlets in Union Square

207
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,425
weeping and undressing while
the sirens of Los AIamos

208
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,357
wailed them down and wailed down Wall,

209
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:06,555
and the Staten Island Ferry also wailed,

210
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:13,537
who Iet themselves be fucked in
the ass by saintly motorcyclists

211
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:16,163
and screamed with joy,

212
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:24,610
who blew and were blown by those
human seraphim, the sailors,

213
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,618
caresses of Atlantic and Caribbean Iove,

214
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,597
The problem, when it comes
to literature, is this:

215
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,563
There are many writers
who have preconceived ideas

216
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,295
about what literature is supposed to be,

217
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:50,499
but their ideas seem to preclude

218
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:53,008
everything that makes
them most interesting

219
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,136
in casual conversation.

220
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:56,479
Their faggishness,

221
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,114
their solitude,

222
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,308
their neuroses,

223
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,612
their goofiness,

224
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:02,982
their campiness,

225
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:06,785
or, even their masculinity at times.

226
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:09,587
Because they think that
they're gonna write something

227
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,992
that sounds like something
else that they've read before,

228
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,359
instead of

229
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,625
sounds like them.

230
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,167
OOr, comes from their own life.

231
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,428
We all talk amongst ourselves;

232
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,505
we have a common understanding,

233
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,269
we say anything we want to
say. We talk about our assholes,

234
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,776
we talk about our cocks,

235
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,710
we talk about who we fucked last night,

236
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:31,941
or who we're gonna fuck tomorrow,

237
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:34,814
or what kind of love affair we're in, or

238
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:38,548
when we got drunk and had a broom
stick shoved up our ass in the

239
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,453
Hotel Ambassador in Prague...

240
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:45,359
I mean, everyone tells one's
friends about that! Right?

241
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:46,395
So...

242
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:50,459
the question is, what happens
when you make a distinction

243
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:53,662
between what you tell your friends
and what you tell your Muse?

244
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,703
The trick is to break
down that distinction,

245
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:59,208
to approach your Muse as

246
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:02,939
frankly as you would talk to
yourself or to your friends.

247
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:10,916
It's the ability to commit
to writing - to write -

248
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:12,983
the same way that

249
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,285
you are.

250
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:19,254
Who balled in the
morning in the evenings

251
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:24,597
in rose gardens and the grass
ofpublic parks and cemeteries

252
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:29,935
scattering their semen freely
to whomever come who may,

253
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:33,507
Who hiccuped endlessly trying to giggle

254
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:38,105
but wound up with a sob behind
a partition in a Turkish bath

255
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:43,153
with a blonde and naked angel
came to pierce them with a sword,

256
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:46,883
The act of writi ng becomes,
li ke, a meditation exercise.

257
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:52,630
If you walk down the street
in New York for a few blocks,

258
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:56,598
you'll get this gargantuan
feeling of buildings.

259
00:18:56,735 --> 00:19:01,001
And, if you walk all day,
you'll be on the verge of tears.

260
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,001
But, you have to walk all day
before you get that sensation.

261
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:09,837
What I mean is, if you write
all day, you'll get into it.

262
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,440
Into your body, into your
feelings, into your consciousness...

263
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,082
I don't write enough in that way.

264
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:35,797
Who Iost their Ioveboys to
the three old shrews offate

265
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:40,135
the one eyed shrew
ofthe heterosexual dollar

266
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:43,506
the one eyed shrew that
winks out of the womb

267
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:47,176
and the one eyed shrew that
does nothing but sit on her ass

268
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:51,915
and snip the intellectual golden
threads of the craftsman's Ioom

269
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:56,759
who copulated ecstatic and
insatiate with a bottle of beer,

270
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:59,420
a sweetheart, a package of cigarettes,

271
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,829
a candle and fell off the bed

272
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:05,061
and continued along the
floor and down the hall

273
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,331
and ended fainting on the wall

274
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,497
with a vision of ultimate cunt and come

275
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:12,508
eluding the Iast gyzym of consciousness,

276
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,810
who faded out in vast sordid movies,

277
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,784
were shifted in dreams,

278
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:26,516
woke on a sudden Manhattan,
and picked themselves up

279
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:30,424
out of basements hungover
with heartless Tokay

280
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,690
and horrors of Third Avenue iron dreams

281
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,858
and stumbled to unemployment offices,

282
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:43,470
who created great suicidal dramas

283
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:46,009
on the apartment
cliff-banks of the Hudson

284
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:49,602
under the wartime blue
floodlight of the moon

285
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:53,684
and their heads shall be
crowned with Iaurel in oblivion,

286
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,479
who wept at the romance of the streets

287
00:20:56,622 --> 00:21:00,319
with their pushcarts full
of onions and bad music,

288
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:04,495
who sat in boxes breathing in
the darkness under the bridge,

289
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:08,926
and rose up to build
harpsichords in their Iofts,

290
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:18,943
who scribbled all night rocking
and rolling over Iofty incantations

291
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:22,774
which in the yellow morning
were stanzas of gibberish,

292
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:26,946
who were burned alive in
their innocent flannel suits

293
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:28,177
on Madison Avenue

294
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,481
amid blasts of Ieaden verse

295
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:34,558
and the tanked-up clatter of
the iron regiments of fashion

296
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:39,454
and the nitroglycerine shrieks
of the fairies of advertising

297
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:43,193
and the mustard gas of
sinister intelligent editors,

298
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:48,238
or were run down by the drunken
taxicabs of Absolute Reality,

299
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:56,373
Would you say that "Howl"
has any literary merit?

300
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:57,641
Yes.

301
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:01,913
And I presume you understand
the whole thing, is that right?

302
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,451
I hope so.

303
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:06,283
It's not always easy to know that one

304
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:09,519
understands exactly what a
contemporary poet is saying,

305
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:10,889
but I think I do.

306
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:14,232
Well, let's go into some of this.

307
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:19,903
"With dreams, with drugs,
with waking nightmares,

308
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:24,338
"alcohol and cock and endless balls."

309
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,708
What significance does that have to you?

310
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,569
Well...

311
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:34,718
there are uprooted people
wandering around the United States,

312
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:36,011
dreaming,

313
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:37,984
drugged...

314
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:39,981
That's clear isn't it?

315
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,719
Even their waking hours like nightmares,

316
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,489
Ioaded with liquor and...

317
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,360
enjoying, I take it,

318
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,334
a variety of indiscriminate
sexual experience.

319
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:55,937
You understand what
"angelheaded hipsters

320
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:58,838
"burning for the ancient
heavenly connection

321
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:02,606
"to the starry dynamo in the
machinery of night" means?

322
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:07,513
Sir, you can't translate
poetry into prose.

323
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,580
That's why it is poetry.

324
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,315
But what are "angelheaded hipsters"?

325
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:32,568
I was working as a copyboy
at Associated Press,

326
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:35,908
and I was able to manage things.

327
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:39,039
Except that I was living in a
$13-a-month, cold-water apartment

328
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:41,709
filled with junkies and thieves.

329
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:46,518
So the place was being filled
with stolen silverware and

330
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:48,489
beautiful oaken furniture

331
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:51,494
taken from the lobbies
of apartment buildings.

332
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,595
At a certain point,

333
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:58,802
I figured that things were
getting too hot, and that...

334
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,905
I'd better get out of there.
You know, get out from under.

335
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:01,767
So...

336
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:04,501
I piled myself and all my manuscripts

337
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,235
into the back of some guy's car

338
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:08,608
that turned out to be stolen.

339
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:10,472
You know, he had in the back,

340
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,778
all these stolen suits and
suitcases and silverware,

341
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,387
and he turned the wrong
way up a one-way street,

342
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,887
at the end of which
there was a police car.

343
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,584
So he swerves his car
to take a side road out,

344
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:24,987
and skidded and smashed
and papers flying...

345
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,860
my eyeglasses lost, all
the clothes upside down.

346
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,734
I jumped out, looked around, and

347
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:33,337
went back in the car to
find my notebooks, but

348
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,873
I couldn't find my eyeglasses,
so I couldn't find my papers.

349
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,238
The crowd was gathering around.

350
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:40,639
Chaos.

351
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,110
Chaos.

352
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:47,644
The easiest way to get
out of the whole thing,

353
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,185
as it turns out, was

354
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:53,485
to just go to the Psychiatric
lnstitute on 168th Street.

355
00:24:57,095 --> 00:25:01,532
I was in the looney
bin for eight months.

356
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,692
I met Carl Solomon there.

357
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,605
He was thinking about the void, also

358
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,207
and such problems, and...

359
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:14,410
We spent months sitting around
asking ourselves whether the

360
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:16,844
authority of the doctors

361
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:19,382
and their sense of
reality was right for us

362
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,715
or whether we were right, or
you know what was happening.

363
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,689
And Carl was having problems

364
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:29,760
because he was receiving
shock treatment.

365
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:34,287
I didn't have any of that,
no medication, no shock.

366
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:40,735
'Cause I'd promised the doctor
that I would be heterosexual.

367
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,139
And that's how I got out.

368
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:49,012
Your mother was
institutionalized, wasn't she?

369
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:57,651

372
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:06,563
who in humorless protest,

373
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:10,065
overturned only one
symbolic pingpong table,

374
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:13,398
resting briefly in catatonia,

375
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:18,141
returning years Iater truly
bald except for a wig of blood,

376
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:20,210
and tears and fingers,

377
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:22,870
to the visible madman doom of the wards

378
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:24,743
of the madtowns of the East,

379

and Greystone's foetid halls,,,

380
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,586
My mother Naomi was...

381
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,715
in and out of mental institutions

382
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:36,622
from the time I was 6.

383
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:42,193
When I was 21, I had to sign
the papers for her lobotomy.

384
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:45,334
She died at Pilgrim State Hospital.

385
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:49,906
,,, bickering with
the echoes ofthe soul,

386
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,032
rocking and rolling in the midnight

387
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:55,340
solitude-bench
dolmen-realms of Iove,

388
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,415

389
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:03,612
bodies turned to stone
as heavy as the moon,

390
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:05,645
with mother

391
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,724
finally fucked,

392
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:10,491
and the Iast fantastic book

393
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,655
flung out of the tenement window,

394
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:17,396
and the Iast door closed at 4 am

395
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:22,370
and the Iast telephone
slammed at the wall in reply

396
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:25,999
and the Iast furnished room
emptied down to the Iast piece

397
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,611
of mental furniture,

398
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:32,581
a yellow paper rose twisted
on a wire hanger in the closet,

399
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:35,413
and even that imaginary,

400
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:40,490
nothing but a hopeful
Iittle bit of hallucination

401
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:43,153
Ah, Carl,

402
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:45,722
while you are not safe

403
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:47,798
I am not safe,

404
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:54,194
and now you're really in the
total animal soup of time,,,

405
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,927
After I got out of the mental hospital,

406
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,590
I had a period of fear where...

407
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:59,036
I felt I had to get out of New York.

408
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:04,633
I was questioning my
sense of reality versus the

409
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:07,506
social sense that was
being imposed on me.

410
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:09,246
It was a position that...

411
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:12,445
Many people in the hospital
came out with, you know,

412
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,711
a total self-rejection,

413
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,953
a rejection of, you
know, their own universe.

414
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:21,155
Lip service, actually, to...

415
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:25,023
supposedly acceptable social patterns.

416
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:28,398
But I was falling in
love over and over again,

417
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,501
and I kept writing my poetry about

418
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:32,330
the people I was falling in love with.

419
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,801
All straight men.

420
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:37,704
And I hitch-hiked
cross-country

421
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:40,606
from Denver with my
friend, Neal Cassady.

422
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:43,714
And Neal was very frenetic,

423
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:45,281
very charming,

424
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,884
and he had six thousand

425
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:51,147
girls across the continent
that were keeping him very busy.

426
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:56,556
OOk... um... no. Um...

427
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:58,592
Kiss!

428
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,793
Wait, wait, you have something...

429
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:04,562
I'll get that.

430
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:06,200
- Better?
- Yeah.

431
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:15,772
- Get it?
- I got it.

432
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:23,181
OOne day, Neal and I were
thrown together in bed, at 4 am

433
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,549
By circumstance...

434
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:27,317
with no place else to go
and no place else to sleep.

435
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,087
And I remember being a little scared,

436
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:34,062
and not quite sure what to do, so...

437
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:37,760
I sort of like turned over and

438
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:40,871
stiffened my body and got
on the edge of the bed.

439
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:44,041
And he saw that I was shy.

440
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:46,839
At the time I was still...

441
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:50,573
scared of feeling with another person.

442
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,483
So he put his arm around me,

443
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:59,215
and pulled me, and

444
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,687
put my head on his breast, and

445
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:05,091
gave me love, actually.

446
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:40,120
And then one day, I got a letter

447
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:42,165
saying, finally,

448
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,598
"We shouldn't consider
ourselves lovers...

449
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,102
"I'm distracted with the wife,

450
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:50,233
"as much as I love you."

451
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,443
So my heart was broken.

452
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,476
"Dear Allen,

453
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:04,621
"What you say is honestly
what I've been doing

454
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,281
"or striving for all my life.

455
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:09,256
"Therein lies our,

456
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:12,158
"or my confused sense of closeness.

457
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:16,331
"Also I fear therein lies our
strength of tie to each other.

458
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:17,559
"l say, 'l fear,'

459
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:21,399
"for I really don't know how much
I can be satisfied to love you.

460
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:22,665
"l mean 'bodily.'

461
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:26,265
"You know, I sometimes dislike
pricks and men and before you

462
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:29,710
"had consciously forced
myself to be homosexual.

463
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:32,411
"You meant so much to me.

464
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,984
"l now feel I was forcing
a desire for you bodily

465
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,815
"as a compensation to you

466
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,784
"for all you were giving me.

467
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:41,785
"Allen, this is straight.

468
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,655
"What I truly want is to live
with you from September to June,

469
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:49,028
"have an apartment,
a girl, go to college,

470
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:50,828
"see all and do all,

471
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:54,336
"and become truly
straight, so please, Allen,

472
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,838
"give this a good deal of thought."

473
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:11,312
who drove cross-country 72 hours
to find out if I had a vision

474
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:12,718
or you had a vision

475
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:15,951
or he had a vision to find out Eternity,

476
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:19,020
who journeyed to Denver,

477
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,528
who died in Denver,

478
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:24,296
who came back to Denver
and waited in vain,

479
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:28,531
who watched over Denver and
brooded and Ioned in Denver

480
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:31,665
and finally went away
to find out the Time,

481
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:34,807
and now Denver is
Ionesome for her heroes,

482
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:42,275
who fell on their knees
in hopeless cathedrals

483
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:46,151
praying for each other's
salvation and Iight and breasts,

484
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:49,953
until the soul illuminated
its hair for a second,

485
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:53,020
who sweetened the
snatches of a million girls

486
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:55,029
trembling in the sunset,

487
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,301
and were red eyed in
the morning but prepared

488
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,869
to sweeten the snatch of the sunrise,

489
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:03,667
flashing buttocks under
barns and naked in the Iake,

490
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:09,410
who went out whoring through
Colorado in myriad stolen night-cars,

491
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:13,540
Neal Cassady, secret
hero of these poems,

492
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:16,251
cocksman and Adonis of Denver,

493
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:20,084
joy to the memory of his
innumerable Iays of girls

494
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:23,193
in empty Iots and diner backyards,

495
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:27,991
Moviehouses'rickety rows,
on mountaintops in caves

496
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:30,927
or with gaunt waitresses
in familiar roadside

497
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:34,501
Ionely petticoat upliftings,

498
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,598
I thi nk it's a howl of pai n.

499
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,202
Figuratively speaking, his
toes have been stepped on.

500
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:43,370
He's poetically putting
his cry of pain and

501
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:45,141
protest into this book, "Howl."

502
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:48,480
And do you think this book
has definite literary value?

503
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:49,617
I do.

504
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:52,048
As a matter of fact, I think in a way

505
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,216
he is employing the
jazz phraseology here

506
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,452
and, may I say, l...

507
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:02,726
I think he's also
employing the words he heard

508
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:06,303
in his life on the road and
in his various experiences.

509
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:08,497
Thank you.

510
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:12,234
Now, do you understand most
of the words in this book?

511
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,671
I think I understand their significance

512
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:16,677
and the general context of it.

513
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:18,072
I see.

514
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:23,884
Taking on page 13,

515
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:25,079
the 14th line:

516
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:29,059
"who howled on their knees in the subway

517
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:34,221
"and were dragged off the roof
waving genitals and manuscripts."

518
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:37,693
Now, do you understand what
that paragraph is trying to say,

519
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:40,395
as a part of the "Howl"?

520
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:42,104
Not explicitly.

521
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:46,272
I would say he was
attempting to show the...

522
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,641
Iack of inhibition in the
persons he's talking of,

523
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:53,206
post-World War ll generation...

524
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,180
those who returned,

525
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,222
went into college or went into
work immediately after WW ll

526
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:05,522
perhaps were somewhat displaced
by the chaos of the war and

527
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,858
didn't immediately settle down.

528
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:11,527
Now, the next paragraph:

529
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:19,270
"who blew and were blown

530
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:23,278
"by those human seraphim, the sailors,

531
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:27,145
"caresses of Atlantic
and Caribbean love."

532
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:31,187
Now, you understand what
"blew" and "blown" mean?

533
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:34,088
Well, I think they are words
that have several meanings.

534
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:37,890
What meanings do you attribute
to the words in this paragraph?

535
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:41,294
It can at one level mean...
that they were vagabonds,

536
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:45,835
that they were being blown
about by natural, literal winds.

537
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:49,098
OOn the other hand, perhaps it
does have a sexual connotation.

538
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:52,937
In reference to oral copulation, right?

539
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:54,506
Yes, possibly.

540
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:56,540
Now then, do you find that those words

541
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:58,444
are necessary to the context

542
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,312
to make it a work of literary value?

543
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:02,146
I thought we had
settled this, Your Honor.

544
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:04,811
Yes, Mr. Mclntosh, if you will recall,

545
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:08,119
I said that I would not allow
the use of the word "necessary."

546
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,959
But you may ask the
question, "Are they relevant?"

547
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:15,191
Are they relevant to make
this a work of literary value?

548
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,857
Yes, I would say so.

549
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:19,663
Now then if you took
those words out of there,

550
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:21,834
Would that spoil the portrayal?

551
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:24,942
That's doing indirectly what Your
Honor won't permit him to do directly.

552
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,135
This man is an expert.

553
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,878
He has to speculate.

554
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:33,382
No, Mr. Mclntosh, I'm afraid I
can't go along with you on that.

555
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:37,248
Whether the author might have
used other or different words,

556
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:40,016
you're getting into the
realm of speculation there.

557
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:41,647
OObjection sustained.

558
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:44,520
Going down a little further...

559
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:51,327
"who sweetened the
snatches of a million girls

560
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:55,428
"trembling in the sunset, and
were red eyed in the morning

561
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:59,532
"but prepared to sweeten
the snatch of the sunrise,

562
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:04,410
"flashing buttocks under
barns and naked in the lake."

563
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,180
What's your question?

564
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:13,216
Is that word "snatches" in there...

565
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:14,756
Is that...

566
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:18,157
relevant to Mr. Ginsberg's
literary endeavor?

567
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:22,699
Yes. I think to use euphemisms
in describing this would...

568
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:26,369
seem dishonest to Mr. Ginsberg.

569
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:30,598
You also said, I believe,
literary value sometimes

570
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:34,404
is a book which will
survive any test of time.

571
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:37,309
Do you think Mr. Ginsberg's work
will survive the test of time?

572
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:39,439
He has no way of knowing,

573
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:42,450
no more than some people thought
"Leaves of Grass" would survive.

574
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:45,419
I'm asking him for his opinion,
to give us an opinion on that book.

575
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:47,490
He says that literary value

576
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,559
depends on surviving the test of time.

577
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:50,922
I want to know if it will.

578
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,461
If Luther Nichols could answer that,

579
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:55,531
then the Good Lord could use a
helper and he ought to be up there.

580
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,598
How can he tell?

581
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:59,168
I'm asking for his opinion as an expert.

582
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:00,099
I'll ask him.

583
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:03,196
Can you answer the question?

584
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:07,608
It calls for a prediction.

585
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,876
I think that this trial
will draw attention to it.

586
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:15,713
"Howl" will have a wider readership
than it might otherwise have had,

587
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:19,755
and may go down in history as
a stepping-stone along the way

588
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,949
to greater or lesser liberality

589
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,822
in the permitting of poems of its type.

590
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:41,309
Poetry, generally, is a...

591
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:44,141
rythmic articulation of feeling

592
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,174
And the feeling is

593
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:50,048
an impulse that begins inside.

594
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:54,655
Like a sexual impulse, you know.
Almost as definite as that. It's

595
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,926
It's a feeling that begins, in
the pit of the stomach, right?

596
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:03,566
And rises up through the breast, and...

597
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:06,431
out the mouth and ears, right?

598
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:09,005
And...

599
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:12,871
it comes forth as a croon
or a groan or a sigh, right?

600
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,508
So if you try to put words to that

601
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:18,171
by looking around you and

602
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:21,307
trying to describe
what's making you sigh,

603
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:23,147
just sigh in words,

604
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:26,152
you simply articulate
what you're feeling.

605
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:29,887
who bit detectives in the
neck and shrieked with delight

606
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:32,962
in police cars for committing no crime,

607
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:37,227
but their own wild cooking
pederasty and intoxication,

608
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:41,694
who howled on their knees in the subway

609
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,137
and were dragged off the roof

610
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:48,075
waving genitals and manuscripts,

611
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:54,913
In the moment of composition,

612
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:57,450
I don't necessarily know what it means.

613
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:00,119
It comes to mean something later,

614
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:01,849
after a year or two, I come to realize

615
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:03,152
it meant something clear,

616
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,625
unconsciously.

617
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:08,058
Which takes on meaning
in time, you know like...

618
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:10,094
a photograph developing slowly.

619
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:13,966
If it's at all spontaneous,

620
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:18,204
I don't know whether it
even makes sense sometimes.

621
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:21,975
And other times, I do know
it makes complete sense,

622
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:25,110
I start crying.

623
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:28,179
'Cause I realize that I'm...

624
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,613
I'm hitting on an area that's...

625
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:33,455
absolutely true.

626
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:37,385
In that sense, able
to be read by someone

627
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:40,554
and wept to, maybe, centuries later.

628
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:43,263
In that sense, prophecy,

629
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:46,533
because it touches a common key.

630
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,035
I mean,

631
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:51,436
what prophecy actually is,

632
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:55,412
is not knowing whether...

633
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,981
the bomb will fall in 1942.

634
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:00,975
It's knowing and feeling something

635
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:03,143
which someone knows and feels

636
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:05,751
in a hundred years. Hmm?

637
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:10,549
And maybe articulating it in a hint that

638
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,356
they will pick up on in a 100 years.

639
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:35,377
who crashed through their minds in jail

640
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:37,282
waiting for impossible criminals

641
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:39,082
with golden heads

642
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:42,351
and the charm of reality in their hearts

643
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:47,822
who sang sweet blues to AIcatraz,

644
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:52,696
who demanded sanity trials
accusing the radio of hypnotism

645
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:54,701
and were Ieft with their insanity

646
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:57,033
and their hands and a hung jury

647
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:03,679
who threw potato salad at
CCNY Iecturers on Dadaism

648
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:05,645
and subsequently presented themselves

649
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:07,717
on the granite steps of the madhouse

650
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:11,082
with shaven heads and
harlequin speech of suicide,

651
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:14,247
demanding instantaneous Iobotomy,

652
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:18,154
and who were given instead

653
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:20,525
the concrete void of insulin Metrazol

654
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:23,599
electricity hydrotherapy psychotherapy

655

occupational therapy
pingpong and amnesia,

656
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:34,174
and who therefore ran
through the icy streets

657
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:36,006
obsessed with a sudden flash

658
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:38,080
of the alchemy of the use of the ellipse

659
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:42,015
the catalog the meter
and the vibrating plane,

660
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:50,456
who dreamt and made incarnate
gaps in Time and Space

661
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:52,755
through images juxtaposed,

662
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:55,126
and trapped the archangel of the soul

663
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:57,130
between 2 visual images

664
00:43:57,267 --> 00:44:01,260
to recreate the syntax and
measure ofpoor human prose

665
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:04,772
and stand before you
speechless and intelligent

666
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:07,069
and shaking with shame,

667
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:09,973
rejected yet confessing out the soul

668
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:12,048
to conform to the rhythm of thought

669
00:44:12,182 --> 00:44:14,446
in his naked and endless head,

670
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:20,614
the madman bum and angel beat in Time,

671
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:23,022
unknown, yet putting down here

672
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,755
what might be Ieft to say
in time come after death,

673
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:32,826
and rose reincarnate in
the ghostly clothes ofjazz

674
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:35,495
in the goldhorn shadow of the band

675
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:40,076
and blew the suffering of
America's naked mind for Iove

676
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,735
into an eli eli Iamma Iamma

677
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,747
sabacthani saxophone cry

678
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:49,478
That shivered the cities
down to the Iast radio

679
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,521
with the absolute heart
of the poem of Iife

680
00:44:52,656 --> 00:44:55,056
butchered out of their own bodies

681
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:58,559
good to eat a thousand years,

682
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:18,070
After I left New York,

683
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:20,776
I spent a year i n San Francisco.

684
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:24,248
I had an apartment on Nob Hill,

685
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:27,621
the tie and suit,

686
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:30,852
a job with several
secretaries which was...

687
00:45:30,994 --> 00:45:32,586
beginning to give me pleasure,

688
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:35,455
the pleasure of knowing I could do it

689
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,591
and was no longer intimidated
by the social forms,

690
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:42,172
to be able to make it in
the very dry, business world

691
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,102
And that's when I met Peter.

692
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:17,870
It was when I met Peter

693
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:20,067
that everything changed for me.

694
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:26,745
It was as if the heavens
showered with gold.

695
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:32,579
Finally somebody loved
me like I loved them,

696
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:37,084
and for the first time, I
felt accepted in my life.

697
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:38,626
Completely.

698
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:50,305
In San Francisco,

699
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,637
I had a year of
psychotherapy with Dr. Hicks.

700
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:57,206
I was blocked, I couldn't write...

701
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:00,246
I was still trying to act normal.

702
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:02,375
I was afraid I was crazy.

703
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:05,386
I was sure that I was
supposed to be heterosexual

704
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:07,854
and that something was wrong with me.

705
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,019
And Dr. Hicks kept saying,

706
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,426
"What do you want to do?

707
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:17,557
"What is your heart's desire?"

708
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:19,828
Finally I said...

709
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:22,131
what I'd really like to do is to

710
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:24,536
just quit all this

711
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:25,571
and...

712
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:27,574
get a small room with Peter

713
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:30,305
and devote myself to my writing and

714
00:47:30,747 --> 00:47:34,615
contemplation and fucking
and smoking pot and...

715
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:36,742
doing whatever I want.

716
00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:40,552
And he said, "Why
don't you do it, then?"

717
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:46,427
I mean, what will
happen if I grow old...

718
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:48,531
and I have pee-stains in my underwear

719
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:51,031
and I'm living in some furnished room

720
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:53,193
and nobody loves me and I'm...

721
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:54,634
white-haired and...

722
00:47:54,771 --> 00:47:57,205
I have no money, bread crumbs
are falling on the floor?"

723
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:58,740
And he said,

724
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:01,401
"Don't worry about that,

725
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:05,504
"you're very charming and lovable
and people will always love you."

726
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:07,879
What a relief to hear that!

727
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,543
I very soon realized that it was all...

728
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,317
a fear-trap...

729
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:15,922
Illusory!

730
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:21,788
What sphinx of cement and aluminum

731
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:24,298
bashed open their skulls

732
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:27,301
and ate up their brains and imagination?

733
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:32,432
Moloch! Solitude! Filth!

734
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:36,774
Ugliness! Ashcans and
unobtainable dollars!

735
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:40,077
Children screaming under stairways!

736
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:42,708
Boys sobbing in armies!

737
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:45,481
OId men weeping in the parks!

738
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:48,386
Moloch! Moloch!

739
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:53,087
Nightmare of Moloch!
Moloch the Ioveless!

740
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:55,394
Mental Moloch!

741
00:48:55,532 --> 00:48:59,127
Moloch the heavy judger of men!

742
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:05,839
Peter and I saw Moloch
one day when we took peyote

743
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:08,877
and were wandering
around downtown streets.

744
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:13,071
It's a god that you
make fire sacrifices to.

745
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:14,615
But...

746
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:18,716
in my mind, it was what
drove my mother to madness.

747
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:22,648
So, I had the line

748
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:27,259
Moloch whose eyes are a
thousand blind windows.

749
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,155
I had this word,

750
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,334
And... I also had the feeling

751
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,904
DA de de DA de de DA de de DA DA, Hmm?

752
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:40,976
So then all I had to do was
look up and see a lot of windows,

753
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:43,136
and say, "OOh, windows, of course,"

754
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:45,847
But what kind of windows? Right? And...

755
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,848
Not only that...

756
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,283
"Moloch whose eyes"... Right?

757
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:53,583
"Moloch whose eyes" which
is beautiful in itself but...

758
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:55,655
You know, what about it?

759
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:56,884
"Moloch whose eyes" what?

760
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:59,188
"Moloch whose eyes"...

761
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:02,457
Then the next thing I
thought was probably...

762
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:03,156
"Thousands."

763
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,961
OOK, but "thousands" what?

764
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:06,729
"Thousands blind"...

765
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:09,805
And then I had to
finish it somehow. So...

766
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,237
I had to say "windows."

767
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:21,782
Moloch whose eyes are a
thousand blind windows!

768
00:50:23,987 --> 00:50:26,080
Moloch whose skyscrapers

769
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:29,715
stand in the Iong streets
Iike endless Jehovahs!

770
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:35,456
Moloch whose factories
dream and croak in the fog!

771
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:42,364
Moloch whose Iove is
endless oil and stone!

772
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:47,574
Moloch whose soul is
electricity and banks!

773
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:53,044
Moloch whose fate is a
cloud of sexless hydrogen!

774
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,581
Moloch in whom I sit Ionely!

775
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:01,923
Moloch in whom I dream Angels!

776
00:51:04,294 --> 00:51:06,057
Crazy in Moloch!

777
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:08,490
Cocksucker in Moloch!

778
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:12,226
Lacklove and manless in Moloch!

779
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:16,330
Moloch who entered my soul early!

780
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:21,476
Moloch who frightened me
out of my natural ecstasy!

781
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:24,104
Moloch whom I abandon!

782
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,840
Wake up in Moloch!

783
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:29,947
Light streaming out of the sky!

784
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:34,056
Moloch! Moloch!

785
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:35,681
Robot apartments!

786
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:37,555
Invisible suburbs!

787
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:39,761
Skeleton treasuries!

788
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:41,488
BIind capitals!

789
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:43,098
Demonic industries!

790
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:44,996
Spectral nations!

791
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:47,695
Invincible mad houses!

792
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:49,430
Granite cocks!

793
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:51,604
Monstrous bombs!

794
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:56,508
They broke their backs
Iifting Moloch to Heaven!

795
00:51:57,881 --> 00:51:59,974
Pavements, trees!

796
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:02,108
Lifting the city to Heaven

797
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:05,244
which exists and is everywhere about us!

798
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:07,247
Dreams!

799
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:08,687
Adorations!

Religions!

802
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:14,860
The whole boatload
of sensitive bullshit!

803
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:16,957
Breakthroughs!

804
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:18,901
Over the river!

805
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:21,261
FIips and crucifixions!

806
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:23,304
Gone down the flood!

807
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:25,632
Highs! Epiphanies!

808
00:52:25,775 --> 00:52:26,833
Despairs!

809
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:31,346
Ten years'animal screams and suicides!

810
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:35,008
Minds! New Ioves! Mad generation!

811
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,620
Down on the rocks of Time!

812
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:40,746
Real holy Iaughter in the river!

813
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:42,552
They saw it all!

814
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:46,157
The wild eyes! The holy yells!

815
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:47,888
They bade farewell!

816
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:51,159
They jumped off the roof! To solitude!

817
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:52,325
Waving!

818
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:54,369
Carrying flowers!

819
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,369
Down to the river!

820
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:58,171
Into the street!

821
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:02,769
It is my opi nion that if
it has any literary value,

822
00:53:02,913 --> 00:53:04,676
it's negligible.

823
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:07,510
I endeavored to arrive at my opinion

824
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:08,811
on an objective basis.

825
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:09,884
For example,

826
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:14,184
a great literary work, or even
a fairly great literary work,

827
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:17,760
would obviously be
exceedingly successful in form,

828
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:20,788
but this poem is really
just a weak imitation

829
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:24,264
of a form that was used 80 to
90 years ago by Walt Whitman.

830
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:26,926
And do you recall the name of that poem?

831
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:30,130
"Leaves of Grass" was
the name of the poem.

832
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:32,833
Literary value could
also reside in theme,

833
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:36,405
and what little literary
value there is in "Howl,"

834
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,070
it seems to me does come in theme.

835
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:42,207
The statement of the idea of
the poem was relatively clear,

836
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:45,344
but it has little validity,
and, therefore, the theme

837
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:46,955
has a negative value.

838
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:48,216
No value at all.

839
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:49,382
Thank you.

840
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:52,762
Did I understand you to say that

841
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:55,797
Ginsberg used Walt Whitman's style?

842
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:56,864
The form.

843
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,298
The form of the book "Leaves of Grass."

844
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:01,768
And because of Ginsberg's
using this format,

845
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:04,339
it is your opinion that the poem "Howl"

846
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:06,305
has no literary value or...

847
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:08,070
merit, is that true?

848
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:10,404
OOn the basis of form, that's correct,

849
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:12,947
because great literature always creates

850
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,210
its own form for each
significant occasion.

851
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:17,582
By that, you do not mean that

852
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:20,622
Walt Whitman's "Leaves of
Grass" doesn't quite qualify?

853
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,782
That is great literature.

854
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,087
The form was created by Walt Whitman.

855
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:26,957
And at the same time, you say, because

856
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,065
Ginsberg copied that format,

857
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:32,396
"Howl" has no value
or merit, am I correct?

858
00:54:32,535 --> 00:54:33,559
That is correct.

859
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:37,002
An imitation never does have
the value of the original.

860
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,767
Who did Walt Whitman copy?

861
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:41,139
To my knowledge, no one.

862
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:42,433
But you don't know,

863
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:45,070
isn't that your answer,
you don't know, sir?

864
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:47,675
That's right.

865
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:49,713
As I understand, your next signpost

866
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:51,377
is that the idea

867
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:54,251
of "Howl" is clear,
but has little validity.

868
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:56,154
Am I quoting you correctly?

869
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,651
That's the general conclusion, yes...

870
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,854
the idea of "Howl" is clear in theme.

871
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:02,259
- The idea is clear?
- Yes.

872
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:06,058
What idea does Ginsberg have in "Howl"?

873
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:09,660
Well, he celebrates the
unfortunate life of...

874
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:13,670
I can't remember the
man's name, Solomon...

875
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:16,370
the unfortunate life
of the man, Solomon,

876
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:18,981
who is a drifter of Dadaist persuasion.

877
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:20,674
A drift what?

878
00:55:21,084 --> 00:55:23,109
Drifter of Dadaist persuasion.

879
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,380
He portrays that?

880
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:27,019
That's correct.

881
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:29,951
And does that portrayal
have any validity?

882
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:32,220
Not as literature, no.

883
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:34,121
Carl Solomon!

884
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:38,930
I'm with you in Rockland
where you're madder than I am,

885
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:44,599
I'm with you in Rockland where
you must feel very strange,

886
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:50,272
I'm with you in Rockland where
you imitate the shade of my mother,

887
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:56,818
I'm with you in Rockland where you
pun on the bodies of your nurses,

888
00:55:56,953 --> 00:55:59,353
the harpies of the Bronx,

889
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,923
I'm with you in Rockland

890
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:04,526
where you bang on the catatonic piano

891
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:06,822
the soul is innocent and immortal

892
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:10,592
it should never die ungodly
in an armed madhouse,

893
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:12,926
I'm with you in Rockland

894
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:14,866
where fifty more
shocks will never return

895
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:16,972
your soul to its body again

896
00:56:17,107 --> 00:56:20,508
from its pilgrimage
to a cross in the void,

897
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:22,873
I'm with you in Rockland

898
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:24,809
where you accuse your
doctors of insanity

899
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:27,576
and plot the Hebrew socialist revolution

900
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:30,777
against the fascist national Golgotha

901
00:56:31,855 --> 00:56:33,516
I'm with you in Rockland

902
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:35,851
where you will split the
heavens of Long Island

903
00:56:35,992 --> 00:56:38,426
and resurrect your Iiving human Jesus

904
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,586
from the superhuman tomb

905
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:44,231
I'm with you in Rockland
where there are 25,000

906
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:46,927
mad comrades all together singing

907
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,630
the final stanzas of the Internationale,

908
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,205
I'm with you in Rockland

909
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:54,742
where we wake up
electrified out of the coma

910
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:58,541
by our own souls'airplanes
roaring over the roof,

911
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:01,778
They've come to drop angelic bombs

912
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,512
the hospital illuminates itself

913
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:08,185
imaginary walls collapse

914
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:12,221
O skinny Iegions run outside

915
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:18,795
O starry-spangled shock of
mercy the eternal war is here

916
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:25,902
O victory forget your
underwear we're free

917
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:29,975
I'm with you in Rockland

918
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,637
in my dreams

919
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:34,511
you walk dripping from a sea-journey

920
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:37,017
on the highway across America

921
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:40,516
in tears to the door of my cottage

922
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:42,454
in the Western night,

923
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:50,164
What is your i mpression of
the thi rd portion of "Howl"?

924
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,326
My understanding there would
be that the poet expresses

925
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,563
the usual Dadaist line that

926
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:58,572
everything is created for man's despair,

927
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:01,575
that everything must be
forgotten and destroyed, and

928
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:04,271
that Solomon's life apparently
has had this kind of rhythm.

929
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:06,314
Therefore, there is some validity

930
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:08,849
of theme, in that area.

931
00:58:09,118 --> 00:58:11,177
So, there is validity of theme there?

932
00:58:12,222 --> 00:58:15,851
I am afraid I got my tongue
tripped up there... this...

933
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:18,483
I should have said "clarity"
instead of "validity."

934
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:20,892
But you've been using
the term "validity"

935
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:23,021
the entire time you've
been on the stand.

936
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,895
By the way, Mr. Kirk, have
you read the Holy Bible?

937
00:58:26,803 --> 00:58:27,963
I have.

938
00:58:28,538 --> 00:58:30,165
Tell me, did you read Job?

939
00:58:30,306 --> 00:58:31,330
I have.

940
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:35,036
Isn't Job crying the same
cry as Ginsberg's "Howl"?

941
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,406
Not at all.

942
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:40,312
Do you agree with me that
Job does condemn life?

943
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:43,778
Job condemns man's condition, yes,

944
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,481
but he does not go on then,
as the Dadaist goes on, to...

945
00:58:47,624 --> 00:58:49,489
desire to wipe out all human memory

946
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:51,389
of everything the
human race has ever done

947
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:54,361
so that there can be a fresh start made

948
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:55,930
as the Dadaist does.

949
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:57,396
And you don't believe
in that philosophy?

950
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:57,966
Not at all.

951
00:58:58,234 --> 00:59:01,465
No, it's been dead
since about 1922 or '23.

952
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:03,094
But that doesn't necessarily mean that

953
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:05,036
someone who does believe that is...

954
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:06,105
wrong, does it?

955
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:09,109
No, but that does not create literature.

956
00:59:09,245 --> 00:59:10,542
Well, what...

957
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:13,112
What creates literature, Mr. Kirk?

958
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:16,546
I'd have to return to my three
bases of objective criticism:

959
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:18,745
form, theme and opportunity.

960
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:19,946
Well...

961
00:59:20,089 --> 00:59:22,580
Do you feel that Ginsberg had the

962
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:24,625
opportunity in his travels

963
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:26,558
to observe life and to write about it?

964
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:28,391
A small segment, yes.

965
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:30,226
And this is the segment
that he's writing about,

966
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:31,060
isn't that right?

967
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,167
OOne thing...

968
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:34,896
Answer that question,
please, "Yes" or "No."

969
00:59:35,805 --> 00:59:39,297
Uh... I'm... I'm confused.

970
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:42,437
This is the segment
that he is writing about,

971
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:43,238
isn't that true?

972
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:45,313
I can't answer that
either "Yes" or "No."

973
00:59:45,448 --> 00:59:47,075
But you said in his travels,

974
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:49,309
he wrote about a small
segment of the community.

975
00:59:49,852 --> 00:59:51,581
Here's where the confusion comes in:

976
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:54,713
I believe the travels are
Solomon's, not Ginsberg's.

977
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:56,381
That's the basis of my confusion.

978
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:59,423
Yes, well, Ginsberg is
writing it about Solomon...

979
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:01,189
It's his own observations.

980
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:02,389
You have read that, haven't you?

981
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:04,723
I am unable to know whether he has

982
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:06,357
an acquaintance with Solomon.

983
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:08,936
That is the thing that
is beyond my experience,

984
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:10,369
beyond my knowledge.

985
01:00:10,506 --> 01:00:13,168
Do you evaluate a work
by whether the writer knew

986
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:14,469
the person he was talking about?

987
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:16,108
Absolutely.

988
01:00:16,245 --> 01:00:19,271
Are you certain that
Carl Solomon ever lived?

989
01:00:19,415 --> 01:00:20,040
No.

990
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:21,914
Then you don't know, do you?

991
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:22,908
Not at all.

992
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,888
Have you ever read... Voltaire?

993
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:28,789
I've read one work,

994
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:29,820
"Candide."

995
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:31,517
And what is your opinion of "Candide"?

996
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:34,061
As literature? It's great literature.

997
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:36,491
And whose style did Voltaire copy?

998
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:37,258
OOh!

999
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:37,991
Your Honor!

1000
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:38,623
Please!

1001
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:40,698
Counsel is allowed to make an objection.

1002
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:42,361
If he objects.

1003
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:44,998
Well, I would like to...

1004
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:49,010
I don't want to box with him.

1005
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:50,840
He's disturbing me.

1006
01:00:51,748 --> 01:00:54,615
I get my mouth open and out fly fists.

1007
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:04,526
How long have you reflected on "Howl"?

1008
01:01:05,695 --> 01:01:06,957
I believe two weeks.

1009
01:01:07,096 --> 01:01:08,154
Two weeks?

1010
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:10,390
Two weeks would be the
limit of my opportunity.

1011
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:12,831
However, I made my
mind up after 5 minutes.

1012
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:15,267
And you reflected a long, long time

1013
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:17,305
on Voltaire's "Candide," is that right?

1014
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,532
Exactly.

1015
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,734
Well, do you think
that if you had another

1016
01:01:20,877 --> 01:01:22,674
ten years to reflect on "Howl,"

1017
01:01:22,812 --> 01:01:24,507
you might change your opinion?

1018
01:01:24,647 --> 01:01:26,911
I am quite certain I would not.

1019
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:30,641
That is all.

1020
01:01:32,321 --> 01:01:34,653
,,, where you accuse
your doctors ofinsanity

1021
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:37,191
and plot the Hebrew socialist revolution

1022
01:01:37,326 --> 01:01:40,261
against the fascist national Golgotha,

1023
01:01:40,396 --> 01:01:42,057
I'm with you in Rockland

1024
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:44,758
where you will split the
heavens of Long Island

1025
01:01:44,901 --> 01:01:49,861
and resurrect your Iiving human
Jesus from the superhuman tomb

1026
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:52,537
I'm with you in Rockland

1027
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:56,543
where there are 25,000
mad comrades all together

1028
01:01:56,679 --> 01:02:00,171
singing the final stanzas
of the Internationale

1029
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:02,984
I'm with you in Rockland

1030
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,144
where we hug and kiss

1031
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:08,155
the United States under our bedsheets,

1032
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:09,982
The United States

1033
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:13,562
that coughs all night
and won't Iet us sleep,

1034
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:15,796
I'm with you in Rockland

1035
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:20,095
where we wake up
electrified out of the coma

1036
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:23,865
by our own souls' airplanes
roaring over the roof

1037
01:02:24,006 --> 01:02:27,772
they've come to drop angelic bombs

1038
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:30,877
the hospital illuminates itself

1039
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:34,380
imaginary walls collapse

1040
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:38,347
O skinny Iegions run outside

1041
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:41,818
O starry-spangled shock of mercy

1042
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:44,620
the eternal war is here!

1043
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,388
O victory!

1044
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:48,424
Forget your underwear!

1045
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:50,031
We're free!

1046
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:53,399
I'm with you in Rockland

1047
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:55,699
in my dreams

1048
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:58,398
you walk dripping from a sea-journey

1049
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:00,839
on the highway across America

1050
01:03:00,977 --> 01:03:04,970
in tears to the door of my cottage

1051
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:07,173
in the Western night,

1052
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:20,354
"Howl" contai ns words,

1053
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:22,987
taken just by themselves, Your Honor,

1054
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:25,396
that are definitely obscene.

1055
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:28,695
And we have had different
literary experts testify that

1056
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:32,672
the books have literary
merit, and that the words

1057
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:35,505
are necessary to that so-called merit.

1058
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:40,210
But it's funny in our law,

1059
01:03:40,349 --> 01:03:41,907
we are allowed to use

1060
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:44,747
expert witnesses to testify
as to literary merit,

1061
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:47,515
but we are not allowed to bring in,

1062
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,887
we will say, the average man

1063
01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:52,551
to testify that when he reads the book,

1064
01:03:52,695 --> 01:03:54,287
he doesn't understand it.

1065
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:57,024
He doesn't know what it's all about.

1066
01:03:57,633 --> 01:03:59,692
Perhaps it's over his head.

1067
01:04:00,236 --> 01:04:02,363
Take, for example...

1068
01:04:04,574 --> 01:04:08,408
Frankly, and I made the comment
in open court that I'd read it,

1069
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:11,304
I don't understand it very well.

1070
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:13,677
In fact, looking it all over,

1071
01:04:13,816 --> 01:04:16,546
I think it's a lot
of sensitive bullshit,

1072
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:19,052
using the language of Mr. Ginsberg.

1073
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:20,748
So then,

1074
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:24,982
If the sale of a book is
not being limited to just

1075
01:04:25,127 --> 01:04:26,458
modern book reviewers

1076
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:28,530
and experts on modern poetry,

1077
01:04:28,664 --> 01:04:30,996
but falls into the hands
of the general public,

1078
01:04:31,133 --> 01:04:33,829
that is to say, the average reader,

1079
01:04:34,837 --> 01:04:36,964
this court should take
that into consideration

1080
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:40,269
in determining whether
or not "Howl" is obscene.

1081
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:42,444
Thank you, Your Honor

1082
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:44,709
Alright...

1083
01:04:44,847 --> 01:04:46,337
I will hear from the defense.

1084
01:04:52,188 --> 01:04:55,851
The United States Supreme
Court has said that obscenity

1085
01:04:56,792 --> 01:04:58,350
is construed to mean

1086
01:04:58,995 --> 01:05:01,862
"having a substantial
tendency to corrupt

1087
01:05:01,998 --> 01:05:04,592
"by arousing lustful desires."

1088
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:11,538
Is the word relevant to what
the author is trying to say,

1089
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:15,305
or did he just use it
to be dirty and filthy?

1090
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:19,244
He sees what he terms as

1091
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:22,809
"an Adonis of Denver, joy to the memory

1092
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:25,386
"of his innumerable conquests.

1093
01:05:25,521 --> 01:05:28,183
who went out whoring through Colorado

1094
01:05:28,324 --> 01:05:31,350
in myriad stolen night-cars

1095
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:36,397
Neal Cassady, secret hero of this poem,

1096
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:39,160
cocksman and Adonis of Denver,

1097
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:43,902
joy to the memory of his
innumerable Iays of girls

1098
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:47,476
in empty Iots and diner backyards,

1099
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,204
moviehouses'rickety rows,

1100
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:55,215
on mountaintops in caves
or with gaunt waitresses

1101
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:59,754
in familiar roadside
Ionely petticoat upliftings

1102
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:05,020
and especially secret
gas-station solipsisms ofjohns,

1103
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:07,391
and hometown alleys too,

1104
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:10,857
Now, I suppose he could have said that,

1105
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,093
the secret hero of these poems,

1106
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:16,693
this "cocksman," this
"Adonis of Denver,"

1107
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:20,468
joy to memory of his
innumerable conquests

1108
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:21,906
at the Waldorf Astoria...

1109
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:25,339
or at dinner at Chasen's,
or after one or two drinks,

1110
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:27,813
in going to bed at the Stork Club.

1111
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:30,710
I presume he could have said that...

1112
01:06:30,853 --> 01:06:32,753
but that isn't the kind of person

1113
01:06:32,888 --> 01:06:34,719
he is writing about.

1114
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:37,751
It is not for us to choose the words.

1115
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:40,591
Mr. Ginsberg, in telling his story,

1116
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:42,493
is telling the story as he sees it.

1117
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:44,394
He is using his words.

1118
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:47,058
There are books that
have the power to change

1119
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:48,568
men's minds,

1120
01:06:48,904 --> 01:06:51,304
and call attention to situations that...

1121
01:06:51,774 --> 01:06:52,832
are visible but

1122
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:54,005
unseen.

1123
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:58,674
Now whether "Howl" is
or is not "obscene" is of

1124
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:02,514
Iittle importance to our world,
faced as it is with the threat

1125
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:04,380
of physical survival,

1126
01:07:05,254 --> 01:07:05,913
but...

1127
01:07:06,655 --> 01:07:08,953
the problem of what
is legally permissible

1128
01:07:09,091 --> 01:07:12,026
in the description of
sexual acts or feelings

1129
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:15,096
in arts and literature is
of the greatest importance

1130
01:07:15,231 --> 01:07:17,165
to a free society.

1131
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:19,764
What is "prurient"?

1132
01:07:20,236 --> 01:07:21,828
And to whom?

1133
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:25,307
And the material so
described is dangerous to some

1134
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:27,466
unspecified, susceptible reader.

1135
01:07:28,144 --> 01:07:29,372
It is interesting that

1136
01:07:29,512 --> 01:07:31,878
the person applying such
standards of censorship

1137
01:07:32,014 --> 01:07:34,380
rarely feels as if their own

1138
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:37,008
physical or moral health is in jeopardy.

1139
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:39,447
The desire to censor is...

1140
01:07:39,955 --> 01:07:42,583
not limited, however,
to crackpots and bigots.

1141
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:43,919
There is...

1142
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,453
in most of us, a desire to

1143
01:07:46,962 --> 01:07:49,624
make the world conform to our own views.

1144
01:07:49,765 --> 01:07:52,757
And it takes all of the force
of our own reason as well as

1145
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:56,429
our legal institutions
to defy so human an urge.

1146
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:59,207
The battle of censorship will not be

1147
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:01,775
finally settled by
Your Honor's decision,

1148
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:06,041
but you will either add to
liberal, educated thinking,

1149
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:08,840
or by your decision, you will add fuel

1150
01:08:08,984 --> 01:08:10,918
to the fire of ignorance.

1151
01:08:12,988 --> 01:08:14,649
Let there be light.

1152
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:18,184
Let there be honesty.

1153
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:20,823
Let there be no running from

1154
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:24,490
non-existent destroyers of morals.

1155
01:08:25,801 --> 01:08:28,793
Let there be honest understanding.

1156
01:08:33,142 --> 01:08:35,542
Gentleman, is the matter submitted?

1157
01:08:36,812 --> 01:08:38,473
It is submitted, Your Honor.

1158
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:41,411
It is so submitted.

1159
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:14,380
All rise.

1160
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:21,216
Be seated.

1161
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:32,960
There are a number of
words used in "Howl"

1162
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:36,128
that are presently
considered coarse and vulgar

1163
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:38,240
in some circles of the community,

1164
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:41,810
and in other circles, such
words are in everyday use.

1165
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:44,236
The author of "Howl"

1166
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:46,507
has used those words
because he believed that

1167
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:50,016
his portrayal required
them as being in character.

1168
01:09:50,152 --> 01:09:53,952
The People state that such
words are not necessary

1169
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:58,583
and that others would be
more palatable for good taste.

1170
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:03,859
The answer is that life is
not encased in one formula

1171
01:10:03,999 --> 01:10:05,933
whereby everyone acts the same

1172
01:10:06,068 --> 01:10:08,696
and conforms to a particular pattern.

1173
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,939
No two persons think alike.

1174
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:14,372
We were all made from the same form

1175
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:16,769
but in different patterns.

1176
01:10:17,112 --> 01:10:19,603
Would there be any
freedoms of press or speech

1177
01:10:19,748 --> 01:10:22,012
if one must reduce his vocabulary

1178
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:24,346
to vapid, innocuous euphemism?

1179
01:10:24,486 --> 01:10:28,217
An author should be real
in treating his subject

1180
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:30,587
and be allowed to express his thoughts

1181
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:32,956
and ideas in his own words.

1182
01:10:33,596 --> 01:10:36,292
In considering material
claimed to be obscene,

1183
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:38,491
it is well to remember the motto,

1184
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:40,625
"Honi soit qui mal y pense"

1185
01:10:40,869 --> 01:10:43,997
"Evil to him who evil thinks."

1186
01:10:44,139 --> 01:10:46,767
The freedoms of speech and press

1187
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:49,207
are inherent in a nation of free people.

1188
01:10:49,345 --> 01:10:53,441
These freedoms must be protected
if we are to remain free,

1189
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:56,312
both individually and as a nation.

1190
01:10:57,486 --> 01:11:00,683
Therefore, I conclude that the
book "Howl and OOther Poems"

1191
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:04,054
does have some redeeming
social importance,

1192
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:06,917
and I find the book is not obscene.

1193
01:11:07,296 --> 01:11:09,526
The defendant is found not guilty.

1194
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:37,717
The crucial moment of
breakthrough came when

1195
01:11:38,427 --> 01:11:40,622
I realized how funny it would be,

1196
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:42,594
in the middle of a long poem,

1197
01:11:42,731 --> 01:11:44,494
if I said:

1198
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,191
"Who let themselves be fucked in the ass

1199
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:49,031
"and screamed with joy!"

1200
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:51,298
Instead of "and screamed with pain."

1201
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,374
That's the contradiction in that line.

1202
01:11:53,509 --> 01:11:56,273
An American audience would
expect it to be pain and,

1203
01:11:56,412 --> 01:11:58,107
instead, it's "screamed with joy!"

1204
01:11:58,247 --> 01:12:00,442
Which is really true.

1205
01:12:00,582 --> 01:12:02,243
Absolutely, 100%.

1206
01:12:03,285 --> 01:12:06,049
And, again, I have a line, like

1207
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:10,757
"Who blew and were blown
by those human seraphim,

1208
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:12,554
the sailors, caresses of

1209
01:12:12,695 --> 01:12:14,560
"Atlantic and Caribbean love."

1210
01:12:16,932 --> 01:12:18,331
It was an acknowledgement of the

1211
01:12:18,467 --> 01:12:21,402
basic reality of homosexual joy.

1212
01:12:22,705 --> 01:12:25,299
That was a breakthrough in the sense of

1213
01:12:25,941 --> 01:12:27,568
public statements about

1214
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:30,543
feelings, emotions, attitudes, you know,

1215
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,104
that...

1216
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:37,474
I wouldn't have wanted my
father or my family to see,

1217
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:41,087
and that I even
hesitated to make public.

1218
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:49,321
The poem is misinterpreted as...

1219
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:51,895
a promotion of homosexuality.

1220
01:12:52,267 --> 01:12:55,361
Actually, it's... more
like a promotion of

1221
01:12:55,504 --> 01:12:58,268
frankness, about any subject.

1222
01:12:59,842 --> 01:13:03,278
If you're a foot fetishist,
you write about feet.

1223
01:13:03,412 --> 01:13:06,142
If you're a stock-market freak,

1224
01:13:06,281 --> 01:13:09,842
you can write about the
rising sales-curve erections

1225
01:13:09,985 --> 01:13:12,044
of the Standard OOil chart.

1226
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:16,854
When a few people are...

1227
01:13:16,992 --> 01:13:18,823
frank about homosexuality in public,

1228
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:20,292
it breaks the ice.

1229
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:24,759
Then people are free to be
frank about anything and...

1230
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:28,627
That's socially useful.

1231
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:39,538
Homosexuality is a condition,

1232
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:42,849
and because it alienated me

1233
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:44,714
or set me apart from the beginning,

1234
01:13:44,853 --> 01:13:48,983
it served as a catalyst
for self-examination,

1235
01:13:49,124 --> 01:13:50,386
or...

1236
01:13:51,226 --> 01:13:54,821
a detailed realization
of my environment and...

1237
01:13:55,597 --> 01:14:00,762
the reasons why everyone
else is different and

1238
01:14:02,871 --> 01:14:04,702
why I am different.

1239
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:26,586
Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy!

1240
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:30,186
Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy!

1241
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:34,166
Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy!

1242
01:14:34,837 --> 01:14:37,169
The world is holy!

1243
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:40,005
The soul is holy!

1244
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:41,939
The skin is holy!

1245
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:44,108
The nose is holy!

1246
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:48,539
The tongue and cock and
hand and asshole, holy!

1247
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:50,208
Everything is holy!

1248
01:14:50,452 --> 01:14:52,181
Everybody's holy!

1249
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:54,082
Everywhere is holy!

1250
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:56,757
Everyday is an eternity!

1251
01:14:56,892 --> 01:14:58,917
Everyman's an angel!

1252
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:01,754
The bum's as holy as the seraphim!

1253
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:07,631
The madman is holy as
you my soul are holy!

1254
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:09,360
The typewriter is holy!

1255
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:11,097
The poem is holy!

1256
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,707
The voice is holy!

1257
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:14,570
The hearers are holy!

1258
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:16,940
The ecstasy is holy!

1259
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:18,705
Holy Peter!

1260
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:19,871
Holy AIIen!

1261
01:15:20,215 --> 01:15:21,113

Holy Huncke holy Burroughs holy Cassady!

1265
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:31,584
Holy the unknown buggered

1266
01:15:31,994 --> 01:15:35,054
Holy the hideous human angels!

1267
01:15:36,431 --> 01:15:39,229
Holy my mother in the insane asylum!

1268
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:44,066
Holy the cocks of the
grandfathers of IKansas!

1269
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:47,470
Holy the groaning saxophone!

1270
01:15:47,843 --> 01:15:50,175
Holy the bop apocalypse!

1271
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:54,170
Holy the jazzbands marijuana hipsters

1272
01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:56,978
peace and junk and drums!

1273
01:15:57,719 --> 01:15:59,380
Holy time in eternity!

1274
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:01,685
Holy eternity in time!

1275
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:04,086
Holy the clocks in space!

1276
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:06,489
Holy the fourth dimension!

Holy the Angel in Moloch!

Holy the sea!

01:16:14,469 --> 01:16:15,766
Holy the desert!

1281
