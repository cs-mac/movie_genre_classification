00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I'll go put him to bed.</font>

00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:11,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">R. Kelly always does the trick.</font>

4
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:15,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think Evan may be
developing a rash.</font>

5
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, when you rub
the Aquaphor on his tush,</font>

6
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you can't just
put it on his cheeks,</font>

7
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you have to rub it
all over the anus, too.</font>

8
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All over the anus, got it.</font>

9
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:27,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I'm going
to take a bath, okay?</font>

10
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:29,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, babe. Go for it.</font>

11
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not this time.</font>

12
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:01,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on. Okay.</font>

13
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep.</font>

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Oh, yeah, you like
it nasty, don't you?</i></font>

15
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:14,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I do. I do, I'm sorry.
Guilty as charged.</font>

16
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:16,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>God, you're so big, it hurts.</i></font>

17
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, I can't help it.</font>

18
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:19,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Oh, yeah!</i></font>

How did...</font>

24
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I saw a monster. A what?</font>

25
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Stick your
finger in my asshole.</i></font>

00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, don't move. Stay here.</font>

37

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you...</font>

40
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mommy, Daddy, are you okay?</font>

41
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jim Levenstein.</font>

42
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They still haven't gotten
you an assistant yet, huh?</font>

43
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kev, I'm sorry, I've been
meaning to call you back.</font>

44
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've just been... Busy?</font>

45
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:55,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get it.</font>

46
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I'll make
this quick, okay?</font>

47
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The reunion, you in?</font>

48
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on, is that
really happening?</font>

49
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, man, check your Facebook.</font>

50
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Look, I know they missed
the ten-year by a couple,</i></font>

51
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>but, you know, seems like
people are actually going.</i></font>

52
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hon. Hey!</font>

53
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm. Dinner smells great.</font>

54
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:14,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Ellie.</font>

55
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Jim.</font>

56
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Ooh, Bachelorette finale later.</i></font>

57
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And don't forget, we still
have to watch Real Housewives.</font>

58
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, how could I forget?</font>

59
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Kev, you know who
my favorite housewife is?</font>

60
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You.</i></font>

61
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:28,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very funny.</font>

62
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:33,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I love my wife, but I
need a weekend with the guys.</font>

63
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Come on, we'll go a few days early.
No Stifler this time.</i></font>

64
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just you, me, Oz and Finch.</font>

65
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well,
good luck with that.</font>

66
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I heard Finch's mom doesn't
even know where he is.</font>

67
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:44,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what about Oz?</font>

68
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:48,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, do you really think he would
come with all he has going on?</font>

69
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we're back
here on Sports View,</font>

00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with my special guest,
Chad Ochocinco.</font>

71
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chad, which college
football powerhouse</font>

72
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:06,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is gonna have the most players
drafted in this year's draft?</font>

73
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna have to go with my
alma mater, the Oregon State.</font>

74
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:12,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, man!
What are you smoking, Ocho?</font>

75
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You think I don't know
what I'm talking about?</i></font>

76
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Do me a favor,
take a look at the tape.</i></font>

77
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, babe, I'm home!</font>

78
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:22,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And that wraps it up for my
special guest, Chad Ochocinco.</i></font>

79
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:27,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>This is Chris Ostreicher reminding
you to play on, plava!</i></font>

80
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Mia?</font>

81
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my gosh!
So funny.</font>

82
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, hey, baby!</font>

83
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:48,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi!</font>

84
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was just watching
your show a minute ago.</font>

85
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:51,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah?</font>

86
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is everything okay?</font>

87
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You tell me. You're in the
hot tub with another dude.</font>

88
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are worried about Deshaun?</font>

89
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw, that is so cute!</font>

90
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deshaun's the interior
decorator I told you about.</font>

91
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Christopher!</font>

92
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Strip down! Come join us.</font>

93
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:10,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe next time, Deshaun.</font>

94
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:15,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I still don't get why we
need an interior decorator.</font>

95
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:19,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because the place needs to look
perfect for the InStyle shoot.</font>

96
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Babe, trust me.</font>

97
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember how you didn't wanna go
on Celebrity Dance Off at first?</font>

98
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now think of all
the fans you have.</font>

99
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:30,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! I almost forgot, Mario Lopez
is having a Memorial Day party.</font>

100
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told him we're in.</font>

101
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:36,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually,
I was thinking about going</font>

102
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to my high school
reunion that weekend.</font>

103
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if you're going,
I'm going, too.</font>

104
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? Yeah.</font>

105
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:45,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

106
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mia, love, phone call.
It's Rumer.</font>

107
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit, let me talk to her.</font>

108
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's with you jacking
my style, bitch?</font>

109
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything I can
get for you, Christopher?</font>

110
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

111
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:21,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Morning, co-workers
and cock-jerkers!</font>

112
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Reggie, give me some love.</font>

113
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looking good, Stifler.</font>

114
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ladies, better be working hard,</font>

115
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you weren't hired
for your looks.</font>

116
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, you were.</font>

117
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not you.</font>

118
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously?</font>

119
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bob, what are you doing here?</font>

120
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you know
they fired your ass?</font>

121
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:42,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

122
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just fucking with you.</font>

123
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:45,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or am I?</font>

124
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

125
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,730

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure, thanks.</font>

127
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,816

some creamer with that.</font>

128
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, you. How are you?</font>

129
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Oh, I'm good, Stifmeister,
'cause you know what?</font>

130

"Yes, you are the..."</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">"You know, I love you so much that I'm
going to just have some fun down here."</font>

133
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Oh, yeah, yeah..."</font>

134
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell are you doing?
Jesus Christ!</font>

135

It's... I was just...</font>

136
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?
That's good, it's all clean.</font>

137
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you to print out the morning
numbers and put them on my desk,</font>

138
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you're making
yourself at home?</font>

139
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I just thought...
"I just thought..."</font>

140
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't pay you to think.
You are a temp.</font>

141
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:34,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, about that. I feel like I'm
being way underutilized here.</font>

142
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:36,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you do, do you?</font>

143
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you for telling
me how you feel.</font>

144
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you mind if I
tell you how I feel?</font>

145
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:44,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel the sooner you realize
that you're the bitch,</font>

146
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not the boss,</font>

147
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the better
off you will be.</font>

148
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fucker.
What was that?</font>

149
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing!</font>

150
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing, Mr. Duraiswamy.</font>

151
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fucker!</font>

152
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:09,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, we still haven't
discussed the whole</font>

153
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">bathtub incident.</font>

154
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh? Oh, that? That's...</font>

155
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That don't worry about that.</font>

156
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I mean,
you know, obviously,</font>

157
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would prefer it
if I was the one</font>

158
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that made you
feel that way, but...</font>

159
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know how you feel.</font>

160
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every time I want to shop online
and I start typing "Amazon,"</font>

161
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:35,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"amazingcollegesluts.com"

162
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Amazing what?</font>

163
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, look, obviously</font>

164
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:47,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we need to have
more fun together.</font>

165
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I promise you, this weekend,</font>

166
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:54,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there is going to be plenty of
Jim and Michelle time, okay?</font>

167
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:02,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

168
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, sweetheart.</font>

169
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How are you? Oh!</font>

170
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's so good to see you.
- Hey, Dad.</font>

171
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, son! Come here.</font>

172
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi! Hi!</font>

173
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no!
Look who that is!</font>

174
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:17,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at this big bruiser!
Oh, my goodness!</font>

175
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He has grown.
- Look at him! Huh?</font>

176
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone's got
a little poopy diaper.</font>

177
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jim?</font>

178
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe it's you.</font>

179
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't remember me, do you?</font>

180
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...
Remember Teletubby Tuesdays?</font>

181
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kara?</font>

182
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

183
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:19,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? You're not
a kid any more.</font>

184
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been a long time since
I needed a babysitter.</font>

185
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:26,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe how
much you've grown up.</font>

186
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks!</font>

187
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's actually my 18th
birthday tomorrow.</font>

188
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:30,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">18, wow.</font>

189
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should come to my party.</font>

190
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, uh...</font>

191
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, no. I...
Yeah, that might be difficult.</font>

192
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, I want you
to come so bad.</font>

193
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Kara! We gotta go.</font>

194
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, relax.</font>

195
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's AJ. Don't ask.</font>

196
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hopefully I will
see you tomorrow.</font>

197
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- Who the fuck was that?</font>

198
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, sweetie.</font>

199
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:55,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

200
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who were you talking to?</font>

201
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was just
the kid next door.</font>

202
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, my old friends.</font>

203
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought about
throwing them out,</font>

204
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but they just have
too much sentimental value.</font>

205
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

206
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Jim, Jim, Jim.</font>

207
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I can remember when
you were just a little guy.</font>

208
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now you've got
your own little guy.</font>

209
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

210
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:58,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And before you know it,
he's gonna be a teenager...</font>

211
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

212
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:03,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you'll be teaching him
about masturbation</font>

213
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and, you know, all the
do's and all the don'ts</font>

214
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that have to do with
the little guy's weenie.</font>

215
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right? Okay?</font>

216
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:11,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hopefully, it'll be more of a bratwurst
by the time he's a teenager...</font>

217
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Dad, I get it.
...but I'm just...</font>

218
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, these are things you're
gonna have to deal with.</font>

219
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand. It's just,
you know, he's two.</font>

220
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, yeah, maybe
you've got time, but..</font>

221
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you know, I just, I'd rather
not talk about his penis.</font>

222
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How you doing, Dad? I'm good.</font>

223
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:26,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah? What are you doing for fun?
You seen any movies lately?</font>

224
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:29,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you know, your mother and
I did go to a lot of movies.</font>

225
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>

226
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:38,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, it has been three
years since she passed, Dad.</font>

227
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's gotta be someone in
town you can see a movie with.</font>

228
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:45,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have you now.
We'll see a movie tonight, you and me.</font>

229
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tonight?</font>

230
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I made plans
with the guys,</font>

231
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to meet up with them
tonight at the bar... Oh.</font>

232
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:51,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But... Yeah, yeah...</font>

233
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I don't need to do that.
I can do that tomorrow.</font>

234
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:57,425
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, no, no, no.
This is why you're in town, isn't it?</font>

235
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no.
You go. I'll be fine.</font>

236
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was just planning
on staying in tonight</font>

237
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and, you know,
doing a little reading.</font>

238
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, not this. No. No.</font>

239
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:15,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Although, I do remember reading
a very interesting article</font>

240
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on something Brazilian.</font>

241
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:22,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boy, these pages are all
stuck together here.</font>

242
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:25,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got it.</font>

243
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:35,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kev.</font>

244
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

245
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's up, man? Jim.</font>

246
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, guys!</font>

247
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oz. There he is.</font>

248
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:44,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You made it.</font>

249
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I missed your wedding,
I wasn't gonna miss this.</font>

250
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, buddy. What's up, pal?</font>

251
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good to see you. Yeah, man.</font>

252
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Kev!</font>

253
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looking good, look at you!</font>

254
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, stop it. Come on.</font>

255
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gentlemen.</font>

256
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Finch? Finch!</font>

257
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:17,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God!
It great to see you, James.</font>

258
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Changed at all, Jim.</font>

259
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:19,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good to see you, pal.</font>

260
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:20,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't think you
were gonna make it.</font>

261
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Finch, how are you, man?</font>

262
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:26,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, after my troubles in Beijing,
I just moved to Dubai,</font>

263
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then I got all caught up in the
world of underground baccarat.</font>

264
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:33,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spent the rest of '09 living
with this African tribe.</font>

265
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,815
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, they made me
an honorary tribesman.</font>

266
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

267
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, that looks like it hurt.</font>

268
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It looks like that
because it did hurt, Kevin.</font>

269
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:45,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since then, I've just been
biking through South America.</font>

270
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, basically, you are the most
interesting man in the world.</font>

271
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:51,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Let me guess,</font>

272
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you guys are here
for the reunion, huh?</font>

273
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got it. Class of '99.</font>

274
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Haven I seen you before?</font>

275
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I'm on TV.</font>

276
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, not you. You.</font>

277
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause, your face,
you're just so familiar.</font>

278
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah! Yeah, this is you, right?</font>

279
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! Man, Nadia!</font>

280
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:15,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>More, more, you bad boy!</i></font>

281
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:17,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I swear I had these all taken down.
How did you...</font>

282
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah. How many times did
you pre-ejaculate again?</font>

283
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, leave him alone.</font>

284
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bet you were all desperate
virgins back then.</font>

285
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Selena Vega.</font>

286
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Selena Vega in front of us.
Wait, wait, wait, Selena...</font>

287
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on, Michelle's
friend from band?</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got it.</font>

289
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God. I'm sorry
I didn't recognize you.</font>

290
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look</font>

291
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">different.</font>

292
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, next round's
on me, okay, guys?</font>

293
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, that chick was in band?</font>

294
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:49,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the first long weekend
I have had in a while</font>

295
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,761

296
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:54,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want the place spotless, and
I want it filled with booze.</font>

297
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:56,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I wanna make sure you're
not around on Sunday night,</font>

298
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'cause I plan on bringing some
ass back from the reunion,</font>

299
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I wanna tap that without you there.
You got it?</font>

300
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, first of all,
Steven, it's my house.</font>

301
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're lucky I'm
letting you stay here.</font>

302
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, you wanted me to
get a job, so I got one.</font>

303
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least let me have the
house for the weekend.</font>

304
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My house, my rules.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And as for tonight, if you
don't wanna risk coming home</i></font>

mother than you'd like,</i></font>

307
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,710

309
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was really...</font>

310
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, bar wench,
can I get a Budweiser?</font>

311
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Beer down.</font>

312
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck are you
fuckers doing here?</font>

313
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,031

314
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you talking about?</font>

315
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean?
We sent you an e-mail</font>

316
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about getting together a couple
of days before the reunion.</font>

317
00:17:56,284 --> 00:18:00,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what? I must have put
two F's in "Stifmeister."</font>

318
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? I'm sorry.</font>

319
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two F's? You dumbass!</font>

320

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kev!</font>

321
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Kevin, is that
a pussy on your face?</font>

322
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:12,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, come on!</font>

323
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah, yeah!</font>

324
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice.</font>

325
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, Stifler,
you're looking sharp.</font>

326
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you up to these days?</font>

327
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I work at JBH Global.</font>

328
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow! That's a big-time firm.</font>

329
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you do over there?</font>

330
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you know,</font>

331

<font face="Comic Sans MS">investment stuff.</font>

332
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People wonder why our financial
system's falling apart.</font>

333
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice scarf. I see you finally
came out of the closet.</font>

334
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How is your mother, Stifler?</font>

335
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You stay away from
my mom, shitbreak.</font>

336
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, boys,
the past is the past.</font>

337
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can bury
the hatchet here, huh?</font>

338
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, fuck it.</font>

339
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, short-shorts!
A round of Jagerbombs for me and my boys!</font>

340
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go fuck yourself, Stifler.</font>

341
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How the hell does
she know my name?</font>

342

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lard Arms?</font>

343
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus, Stifler.</font>

344
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Talk about an ugly duckling
turning into a swan, right?</font>

345
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me see that.</font>

346
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:08,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! Fingered her,
hairy nips, huge boobs.</font>

347
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

348
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There she is!</font>

349
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The creme de my cock.</i></font>

351
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:21,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her given name
was Loni, Stifler.</font>

352
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She used to call me Big Stiffy.</font>

353
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was the mouth
that got away.</font>

354
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Last call!</font>

355
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Already? Wait here, guys.</font>

356
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! Man, the Senior Wish List.</font>

357
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wish List?
I don't remember that.</font>

358
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah, man.
It's that cheesy page in the yearbook</font>

359
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where we all had to write
wishes about our future.</font>

360
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, did you write something cheesy?
Let's see.</font>

361
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:50,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Chris Ostreicher.
Hopes to coach his son's lacrosse team."</font>

362
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! Isn't that the
sweetest thing?</font>

363
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well,</font>

364
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess I thought
I'd have a family by now.</font>

365
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, you wanna hear
what you wrote, Finch?</font>

366
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do.</font>

367
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:04,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Paul Finch hopes to
find le grand amour."</font>

368
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, true love.</font>

369
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:11,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alas, I have yet to find what you
would call a real relationship.</font>

370
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, because banging
Stifler's mom didn't count.</font>

371
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, let's see
what you got, Kev.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, man! Vicky! What?</font>

375
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am sure your wife would
be very happy to read that.</font>

376
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? I was dating
Vicky at the time.</font>

377
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me see what I put.</font>

378
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:35,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Jim Levenstein"</font>

sex life of Ricky Martin."</font>

380
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I'm assuming you didn't
know he was gay back then.</font>

381
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jim, it's a good thing
you found a woman</font>

382
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the sex drive
of a dozen groupies. Hmm?</font>

383
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, you're probably having
more sex than any of us.</font>

384
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Probably, you know.</font>

385
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hope you guys are thirsty.
Stifler Claus is here.</font>

386
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa! Stifler, that's a little
too much, don't you think?</font>

387
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, find your balls
and return them to your sack.</font>

388
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:10,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I say we keep this party going.</font>

389
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I say we make this
weekend our bitch.</font>

390
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We could party together, do all the
same shit that we used to do together.</font>

391
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:17,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll be just like old times.</font>

392
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hell yes! That's why I'm here.</font>

393
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>No Bachelorette,
no Real Housewives.</i></font>

394
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:27,041

chance at your 13th reunion.</font>

395
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was kind of hoping to spend
a little time with the wife.</font>

396
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck! Dude!</font>

397
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,171

398
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, I'm in. Of course I'm in.
Come on, what?</font>

399
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:40,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah! Yeah.</font>

400
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then, gentlemen, I hope you're
all wearing protection,</font>

401
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because this weekend,
we're gonna fuck shit up!</font>

402
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:47,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Cheers!
- Yeah! All right!</font>

403
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck?</font>

404
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit.</font>

405
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:19,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

406
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

407
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened?</font>

408
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:28,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't really remember.</font>

409
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:32,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I blame you. How much did you
let him drink last night?</font>

410
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honestly,
not that much.</font>

411
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:38,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, we gotta clean this up
before we go to the lake.</font>

412
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:42,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? The lake?</font>

413
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, the lake, dude.
It was your idea.</font>

414
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:48,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We discussed
all this last night.</font>

415
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, the lake!
Yes, of course, the...</font>

416
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Jim, can you hand me
those paper towels, please?</font>

417
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, those paper towels?
The paper ones.</font>

418
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

419
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The paper towels, Jim.</font>

420
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jim! Yeah...</font>

421
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The paper towels!</font>

422
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm really sorry.</font>

423
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:20,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jim, you do realize that
the lid is see-through, right?</font>

424
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, wow.</font>

425
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:29,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good eye.</font>

426
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the father of my child.</font>

427
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, come on!</font>

428
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, watch it! Okay, jeez.</font>

429
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am I wrong, or was this place a lot
more fun when we were younger?</font>

430
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:58,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no. I think it's the same.
We're just old now.</font>

431
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But were we just as obnoxious
as these kids back in the day?</font>

432
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:04,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

433
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Us, our generation,
we were more mature.</font>

434
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, guys, check it out.</font>

435
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vagina shark!</font>

436
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He touched my snatch!</font>

437
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:18,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I take that back.</font>

438
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

439
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fellas, do you gotta stare?</font>

440
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:32,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Yeah.</font>

441
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, we do need to stare.</font>

442
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:39,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Could Jim
be any more obvious?</font>

443
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, give him a break.</font>

444
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, it's not every day you get to see
a model walking around off the page.</font>

445
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:49,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There hasn't been
a whole lot of sexy time</font>

446
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:52,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the Levenstein
household lately.</font>

447
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why not?</font>

448
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:56,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know. I'm a mom now.</font>

449
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, please!</font>

450
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just because you're
a mom doesn't mean</font>

451
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:04,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there isn't a whole other side to you.</font>

452
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, remember that
one time at band camp,</font>

453
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when we licked whipped cream
off each other's...</font>

454
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:13,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes! Yes! I remember.</font>

455
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:16,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's keep that
in the past, though, okay?</font>

456
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, she's...</font>

457
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:22,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, you gotta do that, or
else you're gonna get tan lines.</font>

458
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sideboob. There... Sorry.
Sideboob. Ozzy, look!</font>

459
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay! Come on!</font>

460
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a lucky man, Oz.</font>

461
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, come on, guys.
I think we're all pretty</font>

462
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lucky.</font>

463
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:42,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, is that Heather?</font>

464
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it is.</font>

465
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:51,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heather.</font>

466
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:52,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chris!</font>

467
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:54,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

468
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing here?</font>

469
00:25:56,638 --> 00:26:00,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess we had
the same idea, huh?</font>

470
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chris, this is Ron,
my boyfriend.</font>

471
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chris Ostreicher, Ron Douglas.
It's a pleasure to meet you.</font>

472
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:06,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you do?</font>

473
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ron's a cardiologist
at my hospital.</font>

474
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A cardiologist. Wow.</font>

475
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:15,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. And, hey, listen, my friends call
me Doctor Ron, D-Ron or just Dron.</font>

476
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you feel free.</font>

477
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:17,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

478
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:18,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, fuckface!</font>

479
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Choir chick! Whoa!</font>

480
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice to see you, too, Stifler.</font>

481
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:24,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's this douche?</font>

482
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm her boyfriend.</font>

483
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:30,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you two are banging,</font>

484
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you two used to bang.</font>

485
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This must be awkward
for all of you.</font>

486
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:38,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is now.</font>

487
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:41,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That little shit took my top!</font>

488
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:43,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give it back!</font>

489
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, that's my girlfriend.</font>

490
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's this? What's this?</font>

491
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:54,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, kid!
What do you think you're doing?</font>

492
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:57,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!
Come on, come on, let's go!</font>

493
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, guys. Not cool!</font>

494
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What're you assholes gonna do about it?</font>

495
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that was interesting.</font>

496
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, should we do something?</font>

497
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are we gonna do? Come on.</font>

498
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:20,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Agreed. There's no need
to stoop to their level.</font>

499
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:21,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck that!</font>

500
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:24,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know exactly
where they're going.</font>

501
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:28,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stifler?</font>

502
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where the hell is he?</font>

503
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:49,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, this is stupid.</font>

504
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really can't keep Michelle waiting.
Can we just head back?</font>

505
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on.
Let Stifler do his thing.</font>

506
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that's what
I'm afraid of.</font>

507
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you guys see
the look on their faces?</font>

508
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:06,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fucking awesome.</font>

509
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He is crazy.</font>

510
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,858
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think one of those guys
was Kara's babysitter.</font>

511
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which one?</font>

512
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, the one that
looked like Adam Sandler.</font>

513
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:26,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stifler better not
do anything crazy.</font>

514
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:27,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All he's gonna do
is tell them off.</font>

515
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought he was gonna
cut their jet skis free.</font>

516
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened to pissing
in their suntan lotion?</font>

517
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:34,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on. He told me he was
going to steal their beer.</font>

518
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stifler.</font>

519
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:50,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, wait. There he is.</font>

520
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

521
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep, he's
taking their beer.</font>

522
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, hurry up,
Stifler. Come on.</font>

523
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is he doing?</font>

524
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:01,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Wait.</font>

525
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God! Oh, my God.</font>

526
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Steven! No!</font>

527
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God.</font>

528
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yo, so you really think Kara's
gonna give it up tonight?</font>

529
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was waiting until she turns 18.
You do the math.</font>

530
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:15,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only math I know is you've added
your penis to her vagina zero times.</font>

531
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jennifer's not a skank.</font>

532
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, yes, she is.</font>

533
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:24,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna throw up.</font>

534
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God. That's disgusting.</font>

535
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:28,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What're you doing?</font>

536
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:32,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hurry up. Come on!</font>

537
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:34,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Down it, man!
Just chug it! Chug it!</font>

538
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do it. Do it! Don't puss out.</font>

539
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't puss out!</font>

540
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's just go. Let's go.</font>

541
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:40,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go. Go, go, go, go. Go, go.</font>

542
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:43,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want another?</font>

543
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:44,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For sure.</font>

544
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:49,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, I'm telling you, tonight is gonna
be the night she promised me a year ago.</font>

545
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:57,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the...</font>

546
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Dipshit!</font>

547
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

548
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no!</font>

549
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stifler! Are you crazy?</font>

550
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus, Stifler, what happened
to just stealing their beer?</font>

551
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, this is so
much better, right?</font>

552
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

553
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You destroyed
their jet skis.</font>

554
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:31,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They splashed us.</font>

555
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:33,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So...</font>

556
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, guys.
That was pretty funny.</font>

557
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe in high school it was funny.
Now it's just a felony.</font>

558
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only if we get caught.</font>

559
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you gotta admit, it was nice
giving those kids a little payback.</font>

560
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:50,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe it was good that they will
learn to respect their elders.</font>

561
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly!</font>

562
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:54,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, give me a second, I gotta
find some toilet paper.</font>

563
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:55,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's gross.</font>

564
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's up,
Class of '99-ers?</font>

565
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:00,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God! Vicky!</font>

566
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:01,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi!</font>

567
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

568
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:03,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe you're here.</font>

569
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I flew in from
New York last night.</font>

570
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:06,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been hanging
outwith my parents.</font>

571
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:09,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were actually just
talking about you earlier.</font>

572
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? About what?</font>

573
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:13,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That time they caught us
making out at the Falls.</font>

574
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, right.</font>

575
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:18,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Falls. Wow, I haven't
been there in forever.</font>

576
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Michelle used to love
going to the Falls.</font>

577
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:21,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The place is romance incarnate.</font>

578
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:25,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hell, yeah.
I got my first rim job at the Falls.</font>

579
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

580
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, sweetie.</font>

581
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:30,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm, sweetie pie!</font>

582
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:31,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

583
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:36,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, the guys were all talking
about heading over to the Falls.</font>

584
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:39,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, what about
Jim and Michelle time?</font>

585
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was thinking it could
be kind of romantic.</font>

586
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:45,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'd love to, but your
dad has been with Ev all day.</font>

587
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:47,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, no, you're right.</font>

588
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Yeah, we'll
just, we'll go home.</font>

589
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:53,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, no.
You go and have fun.</font>

590
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? Yeah.</font>

591
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:57,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just, when you get home,
you just better be ready.</font>

592
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You better be ready.</font>

593
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:01,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm ready.</font>

594
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:10,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, Stifler, do you know
where you're going?</font>

595
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:13,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know this place
like the back of my cock.</font>

596
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It looks like
a high school party.</font>

597
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:29,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With high school chicks.</font>

598
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:32,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's on.</font>

599
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:35,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch it, Stifler. You know these
girls are, like, half your age.</font>

600
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:36,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

601
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:46,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, is it just me, or do girls
today seem a bit sluttier?</font>

602
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:47,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Definitely.</font>

603
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:50,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Teen sex, rainbow parties,
sexting nude photos...</font>

604
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I saw it all on
Kathie Lee & Hoda.</font>

605
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:55,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Happy birthday!</font>

606
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:03,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jim?</font>

607
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kara. You came!</font>

608
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

609
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:09,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

610
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:11,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Happy birthday.</font>

611
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God,
is this the babysitter?</font>

612
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm-hmm.</font>

613
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:19,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You make it sound like I'm a superhero.</font>

614
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Faster than a speeding stroller,
more powerful than a mini-van.</font>

615
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you he was funny.</font>

616
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:25,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's adorable.</font>

617
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Jim. Do you wanna
introduce me to your friends?</font>

618
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

619
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:35,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Girls, this is Stifler.</font>

620
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, how do you know
my best friend Jim?</font>

621
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,817
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jim used to be my babysitter.</font>

622
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:43,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I was just
gonna do a birthday shot.</font>

623
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you guys
wanna do one with me?</font>

624
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.</font>

625
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Oh, yes, yes, yes.</font>

626
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I shouldn't.
Yes, we should, yes, we should.</font>

627
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:53,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never have I ever
had sex in public.</font>

628
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? None of you?</font>

629
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, come on, Heather.
You haven't drank once.</font>

630
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are such a prude!</font>

631
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:09,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or maybe I've just
never had sex in public.</font>

632
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:15,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, never have I
ever been in an orgy.</font>

633
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:23,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were really nice guys.</font>

634
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:27,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Believe it or not, this is
my first high school party.</font>

635
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't miss much.</font>

636
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:33,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I always preferred staying at
home, throwing on a little NPR.</font>

637
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:35,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were so much
cooler than me.</font>

638
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:39,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I sat around writing
X-Files fan fiction.</font>

639
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:47,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I translated The Brothers
Karamazov into Latin for fun.</font>

640
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is so sexy.</font>

641
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know it is.</font>

642
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've only been
working as an architect</font>

643
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:58,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the last few years,
and from home.</font>

644
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've been with the same
company for over 10 years.</font>

645
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's awesome, it sounds like
everything is working out for you.</font>

646
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. I mean, everything's
good, especially work-wise.</font>

647
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But now that we're
back here in the town,</font>

648
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we see, like,
all of our old friends,</font>

649
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:11,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and everyone's married
and having kids,</font>

650
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:14,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it just makes me,
you know, think.</font>

651
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay there, Kev?</font>

652
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:22,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I just don't
normally drink like this.</font>

653
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're telling me you haven't
gotten a little bit tipsy</font>

654
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on Myers Family Wine Night?</font>

655
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:29,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see somebody's been
stalking my Facebook page.</font>

656
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least I don't take
pictures of my meals.</font>

657
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's stalking who now?</font>

658
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:36,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, so I've been by your
page maybe once or twice.</font>

659
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:40,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were dating someone
named Alessandro?</font>

660
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:44,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, he does know that he can take
a picture with his shirt on, right?</font>

661
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:47,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alessandro is long gone.</font>

662
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's over, huh?</font>

663
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, after this drink,
I have to go home.</font>

664
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jim.</font>

665
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:02,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a smoking hot 18-year-old girl
over there that you used to babysit.</font>

666
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:04,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you're not going to
do anything about that?</font>

667
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Need I remind you that
I am married to Michelle?</font>

668
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:07,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly.</font>

669
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:13,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, these young chicks, they know
some crazy shit in the bedroom.</font>

670
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could take what
you learn from Kara,</font>

671
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">bring it home,
and apply it to Michelle.</font>

672
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You do care about your
marriage, don't you, Jim?</font>

673
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you talking
about, Stifler?</font>

674
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not gonna cheat on my wife!</font>

675
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a father
for Christ's sakes.</font>

676
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that's perfect.</font>

677
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:34,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, chicks love a father figure.
Keep playing that card, dude.</font>

678
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not a card,
it's the truth.</font>

679
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Hi.</font>

680
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you guys
talking about?</font>

681
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you know... Just</font>

682
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jim was just saying how much
fun he had taking care of you.</font>

683
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:48,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, ladies, why don't we give
them some time to catch up?</font>

684
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:49,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm-hmm. Yeah, after you.</font>

685
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:51,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, that's not necessary.
We should all hang out together.</font>

686
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't we all...
Stifler, just...</font>

687
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be her daddy.</font>

688
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stifler? Stifler!</font>

689
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:05,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, sounds like you and Mia have
quite an adventurous lifestyle.</font>

690
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes a little
too adventurous.</font>

691
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:12,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow. Well, Heather's a bit
more on the conservative side.</font>

692
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, uh...</font>

693
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:14,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Hi.</font>

694
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:20,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, I gotta be honest, Chris, I
could use a little adventure myself.</font>

695
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you getting at, Ron?</font>

696
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:27,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just saying that usually
I'm not one for swapping,</font>

697
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:33,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but the fact that you've been with
Heather already, kind of makes it okay.</font>

698
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:36,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what do you think?</font>

699
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:38,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think they'd be into it?</font>

700
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm kidding.
Come on, I'm kidding!</font>

701
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously,
I would never do that!</font>

702
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:48,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unless you guys wanted to.</font>

703
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you've really been to every
country in South America?</font>

704
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:54,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, not all of them.</font>

705
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I don't consider
French Guiana a nation.</font>

706
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:03,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I remember, I couldn't
wait till graduation</font>

707
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:06,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so I could leave this town
and reinvent myself.</font>

708
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:09,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have certainly
reinvented yourself.</font>

709
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

710
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's just a part of me
that still wishes that</font>

711
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could just explore
the world, you know?</font>

712
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be everything I set out to be.</font>

713
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:21,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can be whoever you wanna be.
You just gotta be it.</font>

714
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna make out? Yeah.</font>

715
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you crazy?
I love the Twilight books.</font>

716
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">New Moon is my favorite.</font>

717
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:36,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mine, too!</font>

718
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God!
We have, like, so much in common!</font>

719
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:40,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know! I know!</font>

720
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wanna hit this?</font>

721
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In more ways than one.</font>

722
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know who this is, but
I'm pretty fucking busy right now.</font>

723
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:58,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So sorry to interrupt, Stafler.</font>

724
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't realize the Special
Olympics competed at night.</font>

725
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, fuck.</font>

726
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:05,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell's
going on over there?</font>

727
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:06,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, are you choking
on your own dick?</font>

728
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:10,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing, Mr. Duraiswamy,
nothing.</font>

729
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:12,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What can I do for you, sir?</font>

730
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bob from Acquisitions
had a heart attack.</font>

731
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some idiot told him
that he was fired.</font>

732
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:17,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He flipped out, I don't know.</i></font>

733
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, I need someone
to finish his presentation.</font>

734
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:23,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you to go in on Sunday
and get everything ready. Yes?</font>

735
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, wait, Sunday.</font>

736
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got my high school reunion.</font>

737
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, wow, how fun!</font>

738
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:30,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, no, I'll just
call the chairman,</font>

739
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:31,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'll get him to reschedule.</font>

740
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:34,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously?
Hey, that would be awesome!</font>

741
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:37,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was a fucking joke, you moron.
Jesus Christ, what am I doing?</font>

742
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what, I am gonna
handle this myself.</font>

743
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:43,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, no, no,
listen, Mr. Duraiswamy,</font>

744
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:46,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can do it, okay?
I promise, I'll get it done.</font>

745
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just don't fuck up, Stafler.</font>

746
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Stifler.</font>

747
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:53,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dick! Hey, ladies...</font>

748
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ladies? They bailed, dude.</font>

749
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw, fuck!</font>

750
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ugh! Um...</font>

751
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh!</font>

752
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:05,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Kara, how are you
getting home tonight?</font>

753
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">AJ was supposed to
drive my car back,</font>

754
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but he hasn't
even shown up yet.</font>

755
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some lame excuse
about his jet skis.</font>

756
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you believe that jerk?</font>

757
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about you?</font>

758
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you take me?</font>

759
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh... Um...</font>

760
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on! We're going
to the same place.</font>

761
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Besides, it wouldn't
be responsible</font>

762
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to let me drive
in this condition.</font>

763
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:31,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right?</font>

764
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:40,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Kara.</font>

765
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:44,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Whoa! Careful!
Careful. Yeah.</font>

766
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:46,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God, I love this song.</font>

767
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a good one.</font>

768
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't classic rock the best?</font>

769
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:52,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Classic rock?
This is classic rock now?</font>

770
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:56,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you know, Kara, you
should drink some more water.</font>

771
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:58,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's that bottle I gave you?</font>

772
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:00,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, it's right here. Okay.</font>

773
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the back.</font>

774
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:11,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit. Sorry. Sorry.
There was a...</font>

775
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:15,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was a little baby
squirrel in the road, so...</font>

776
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:20,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa! Hey! Whoa!
That's not water. Okay.</font>

777
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:23,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a little too much now.</font>

778
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:27,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love how, after all these years,
you're still taking care of me.</font>

779
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you know, a
babysitter's job never ends.</font>

780
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:34,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You knew I always
had a crush on you, right?</font>

781
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

782
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to be my first.</font>

783
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your first?</font>

784
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:46,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God. Okay. Um...</font>

785
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kara, listen. Um...</font>

786
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:54,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A person's virginity is
something sacred, you know?</font>

787
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should save yourself
for someone special.</font>

788
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:56,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're special.</font>

789
00:41:57,015 --> 00:42:00,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! Not special.</font>

790
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think? I really...</font>

791
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:04,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

792
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, what are you doing?</font>

793
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. No one
will ever find out.</font>

794
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know. I don't think...</font>

795
00:42:12,142 --> 00:42:15,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I don't.
I don't think that's um.</font>

796
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:17,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think I should do that.</font>

797
00:42:17,459 --> 00:42:20,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No I-I can't, I won't
so, you know that's</font>

798
00:42:20,723 --> 00:42:22,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa. Hello. Okay.</font>

00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:25,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kara! Kara! That's kissing.
Kara you need to stop</font>

800
00:42:25,664 --> 00:42:26,548
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop!</font>

801
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't think I'm pretty?</font>

802
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:34,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh? Oh, no! You're very pretty, Kara.
You're very, very...</font>

803
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:36,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? Yes, very pretty.</font>

804
00:42:36,455 --> 00:42:37,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I... Very pretty. Thanks.</font>

805
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God!</font>

806
00:42:39,624 --> 00:42:42,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit! What?</font>

807
00:42:44,212 --> 00:42:45,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my... Where did your...</font>

808
00:42:45,297 --> 00:42:46,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

809
00:42:46,465 --> 00:42:48,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't think of
a better birthday gift.</font>

810
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:50,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about the new iPhone?</font>

811
00:42:50,594 --> 00:42:52,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh? Maybe a little pendant?
The new Nicki Minaj album?</font>

812
00:42:52,637 --> 00:42:54,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No? Boobies.</font>

813
00:42:54,848 --> 00:42:56,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you! Whoa, whoa, whoa!</font>

814
00:42:56,224 --> 00:42:57,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't... Don't do that.</font>

815
00:42:57,559 --> 00:42:59,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not good, don't...</font>

816
00:42:59,144 --> 00:43:00,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, stop</font>

817
00:43:00,812 --> 00:43:02,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kara! Kara! Stop it.</font>

818
00:43:03,315 --> 00:43:04,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit!</font>

819
00:43:06,485 --> 00:43:07,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

820
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:09,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit. Kara?</font>

821
00:43:10,655 --> 00:43:12,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy Jesus! Kara?</font>

822
00:43:12,324 --> 00:43:14,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kara! Kara!
Please wake up, Kara!</font>

823
00:43:14,868 --> 00:43:16,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kara, wake up. Kara!</font>

824
00:43:16,703 --> 00:43:17,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay?</font>

825
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:18,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Jesus, God!</font>

826
00:43:18,997 --> 00:43:20,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God, are you all right?</font>

827
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:22,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hi.</font>

828
00:43:23,752 --> 00:43:25,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jim? Hey!</font>

829
00:43:26,004 --> 00:43:28,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? This is crazy!</font>

830
00:43:28,757 --> 00:43:30,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you all right?</font>

831
00:43:30,217 --> 00:43:33,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm okay. I was just... Um...</font>

832
00:43:33,845 --> 00:43:36,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was reaching for something.</font>

833
00:43:36,389 --> 00:43:38,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything's okay.
Everything's fine.</font>

834
00:43:39,101 --> 00:43:40,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know if you've heard.
Mmm?</font>

835
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:41,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you hear?</font>

836
00:43:42,187 --> 00:43:44,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am in charge of the reunion.</font>

837
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! Yeah, no, that's...
Yeah, that's right.</font>

838
00:43:47,901 --> 00:43:49,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got a whole '90s theme planned.</font>

839
00:43:49,528 --> 00:43:51,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. That's...</font>

840
00:43:51,446 --> 00:43:53,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I booked Chumbawamba.</font>

841
00:43:53,323 --> 00:43:55,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. But the pricks
cancelled yesterday.</font>

842
00:43:55,575 --> 00:43:58,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was a setback, but you know me,</font>

843
00:43:58,578 --> 00:44:01,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I get knocked down but I
get up again."</font>

844
00:44:04,918 --> 00:44:06,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God!
Okay, I see what's going on.</font>

845
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:14,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep.</font>

846
00:44:14,761 --> 00:44:15,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll see you later, buddy.</font>

847
00:44:16,054 --> 00:44:17,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right then, I'll see you.</font>

848
00:44:20,225 --> 00:44:22,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus, God. Kara.
Kara, wake up.</font>

849
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:24,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just need a nap. What?</font>

850
00:44:25,063 --> 00:44:27,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kara, this isn't time
for a nap. Kara, wake up.</font>

851
00:44:27,315 --> 00:44:28,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't napping time.</font>

852
00:44:29,067 --> 00:44:31,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kara? Shit.</font>

853
00:44:36,491 --> 00:44:40,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God, this is bad.
This is very, very bad.</font>

854
00:44:51,798 --> 00:44:53,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What took you guys so long?</font>

855
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were looking for Kevin.
Couldn't find him.</font>

856
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:58,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Plus, that hot piece of ass Oz is banging
got wasted, so we had to drop her off.</font>

857
00:44:59,139 --> 00:45:00,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You brought him?</font>

858
00:45:00,223 --> 00:45:01,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course they brought me.</font>

859
00:45:01,516 --> 00:45:03,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you guys were busy
jacking off in high school,</font>

860
00:45:03,143 --> 00:45:05,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was running this
drill every weekend.</font>

861
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:07,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, let's see what
we are dealing with.</font>

862
00:45:09,774 --> 00:45:10,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

863
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:13,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit!</font>

864
00:45:13,278 --> 00:45:14,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Way to go, Jim.</font>

865
00:45:14,321 --> 00:45:17,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shh. Okay, nothing happened, Stifler. Okay?
Nothing happened.</font>

866
00:45:17,657 --> 00:45:18,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop that!</font>

867
00:45:18,867 --> 00:45:19,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

868
00:45:19,993 --> 00:45:21,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, Jim, what do you wanna do?</font>

869
00:45:21,494 --> 00:45:22,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

870
00:45:22,829 --> 00:45:24,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't just leave her
here naked, you know?</font>

871
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:27,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, if the cops come by
and find out I'm involved,</font>

872
00:45:28,293 --> 00:45:29,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm screwed.</font>

873
00:45:29,628 --> 00:45:31,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That leaves us
with two options.</font>

874
00:45:32,464 --> 00:45:34,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We dump the body or
we sneak her inside.</font>

875
00:45:34,299 --> 00:45:36,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dump the body?
This isn't a mob hit.</font>

876
00:45:36,468 --> 00:45:37,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, wait a second.</font>

877
00:45:37,844 --> 00:45:41,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have been in her house
a million times to babysit.</font>

878
00:45:41,348 --> 00:45:44,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can totally sneak her in
through the back door.</font>

879
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:47,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you guys to
distract her parents.</font>

880
00:45:47,312 --> 00:45:49,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think you can do that?</font>

881
00:45:49,397 --> 00:45:53,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm an expert, Jim.
Trust me. I got this shit.</font>

882
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:02,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good evening, sir.</font>

883
00:46:02,702 --> 00:46:04,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My friend's car broke down,</font>

884
00:46:04,704 --> 00:46:08,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we were just wondering if we
could use your phone to call AAA.</font>

885
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mean to tell me that none
of you have cell phones?</font>

886
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:23,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Oh, my God, I know you.
You were on Celebrity Dance Off.</i></font>

887
00:46:23,556 --> 00:46:25,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah!</font>

888
00:46:25,558 --> 00:46:26,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ostreicher.</font>

889
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:28,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah.</font>

890
00:46:28,228 --> 00:46:29,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, come on in.</font>

891
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:32,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was very smooth, Stifler.</font>

892
00:46:32,941 --> 00:46:34,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up, shitbreak.</font>

893
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:36,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The last time I did this,
cell phones didn't exist.</font>

894
00:46:52,085 --> 00:46:53,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit!</font>

895
00:46:59,217 --> 00:47:00,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daddy.</font>

896
00:47:02,095 --> 00:47:03,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, Mom, Daddy!</font>

897
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:04,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit!</font>

898
00:47:18,987 --> 00:47:20,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, fuck!</font>

899
00:47:21,823 --> 00:47:23,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kara?</font>

900
00:47:24,576 --> 00:47:25,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kara?</font>

901
00:47:27,537 --> 00:47:28,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kara?</font>

902
00:47:28,747 --> 00:47:30,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gonna have to find me.</font>

903
00:47:31,041 --> 00:47:32,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kara?</font>

904
00:47:33,376 --> 00:47:35,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Sheranda.
You've been very helpful.</font>

905
00:47:35,462 --> 00:47:37,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You get a Triple
A-plus in my book.</font>

906
00:47:38,048 --> 00:47:41,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you take care, too.
Okay, yeah, bye-bye.</font>

907
00:47:42,093 --> 00:47:46,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, that was AAA on the phone and
they should be here in a jiffy.</font>

908
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:49,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does this song sound familiar?</font>

909
00:47:54,397 --> 00:47:57,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were such a good dancer.
I felt so bad when you got voted off.</font>

910
00:47:57,275 --> 00:47:58,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

911
00:47:58,485 --> 00:48:00,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I have to say you're
much sexier in person.</font>

912
00:48:00,695 --> 00:48:04,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Calm down there, Susan.</font>

913
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:08,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, she wants to fuck
you big time, dude.</font>

914
00:48:08,244 --> 00:48:10,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got to hit that.
No fucking way.</font>

915
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:11,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do it for Jim, dude,
don't be selfish.</font>

916
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:15,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you know what?
I think I have to go to the bathroom.</font>

917
00:48:16,002 --> 00:48:18,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kara, this is not funny.</font>

918
00:48:18,296 --> 00:48:20,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kara, come on! Kara, come out.</font>

919
00:48:21,132 --> 00:48:22,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boo!</font>

920
00:48:22,509 --> 00:48:23,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God!</font>

921
00:48:23,831 --> 00:48:25,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Right. Here</font>

922
00:48:25,288 --> 00:48:26,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

923
00:48:26,385 --> 00:48:27,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alright. Okay.</font>

924
00:48:27,501 --> 00:48:28,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good. Okay.</font>

925
00:48:28,299 --> 00:48:29,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alright. Come on.</font>

926
00:48:29,747 --> 00:48:30,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, good.</font>

927
00:48:31,207 --> 00:48:32,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Watch it
- You never could find me.</font>

928
00:48:33,042 --> 00:48:35,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jim, I don't mean to alarm you
but you don't have much time.</font>

929
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:36,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I know.</font>

930
00:48:37,088 --> 00:48:38,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like your scarf. Okay.</font>

931
00:48:38,589 --> 00:48:40,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like your breasts Door.</font>

932
00:48:40,425 --> 00:48:41,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would it be okay
if I get a picture?</font>

933
00:48:42,051 --> 00:48:43,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>

934
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:49,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know it's in here somewhere.</font>

935
00:48:53,271 --> 00:48:55,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, a bottle of hair spray...</font>

936
00:48:55,314 --> 00:48:56,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys all right?</font>

937
00:48:56,441 --> 00:48:57,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Yeah.</font>

938
00:48:58,568 --> 00:48:59,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know something?</font>

939
00:48:59,819 --> 00:49:04,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really was admiring how clean
your toilet was in your bathroom.</font>

940
00:49:05,158 --> 00:49:06,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>

941
00:49:06,951 --> 00:49:09,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what?
I have to use the restroom, too.</font>

942
00:49:09,287 --> 00:49:10,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you don't.</font>

943
00:49:18,004 --> 00:49:19,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get in bed.</font>

944
00:49:19,297 --> 00:49:20,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on and get in bed with me?</font>

945
00:49:20,423 --> 00:49:21,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm not getting in bed...</font>

946
00:49:21,632 --> 00:49:22,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Get in bed with me.</font>

947
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm not... Kara, please.
Oh, God. Please.</font>

948
00:49:25,136 --> 00:49:26,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit!</font>

949
00:49:27,305 --> 00:49:28,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stifler, what are
you doing here?</font>

950
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:30,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just wanted another glimpse.
No.</font>

951
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:32,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why'd you put her clothes
back on, dude? Boo.</font>

952
00:49:32,268 --> 00:49:33,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to go.</font>

953
00:49:35,146 --> 00:49:36,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was that?</font>

954
00:49:36,481 --> 00:49:38,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That sounded like
it came from outside.</font>

955
00:49:38,858 --> 00:49:40,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, that came from Kara's room.</font>

956
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:41,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Jesus.</font>

957
00:49:42,028 --> 00:49:43,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kara?</font>

958
00:49:45,073 --> 00:49:46,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

959
00:49:47,825 --> 00:49:49,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go, go!</font>

960
00:49:56,334 --> 00:49:57,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell's
going on in here?</font>

961
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:00,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, Daddy.</font>

962
00:50:01,714 --> 00:50:02,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd you get back in?</font>

963
00:50:03,841 --> 00:50:05,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't remember.</font>

964
00:50:05,176 --> 00:50:06,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't remember?</font>

965
00:50:07,512 --> 00:50:08,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was that sound?</font>

966
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:09,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

967
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:10,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean,
you don't know?</font>

968
00:50:10,848 --> 00:50:11,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

969
00:50:13,851 --> 00:50:15,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've been drinking,
haven't you?</font>

970
00:50:15,353 --> 00:50:16,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

971
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:19,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kara, I told you these boys
try to get you drunk</font>

972
00:50:19,524 --> 00:50:21,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so they can take
advantage of you.</font>

973
00:50:21,234 --> 00:50:22,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm old enough
to know that, Dad.</font>

974
00:50:22,985 --> 00:50:24,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, I don't
want to go to jail</font>

975
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:26,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for kicking some
horny kid's teeth in</font>

976
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:28,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I will, believe me.</font>

977
00:50:32,078 --> 00:50:33,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>

978
00:50:33,371 --> 00:50:36,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that's Mr. Moo!</font>

979
00:50:37,416 --> 00:50:40,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you get him for me,
Daddy? Please.</font>

980
00:50:57,436 --> 00:50:59,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't be mad at my angel.</font>

981
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:07,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Happy birthday, princess.</font>

982
00:51:07,947 --> 00:51:09,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, Dad.</font>

983
00:51:18,541 --> 00:51:19,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

984
00:51:20,418 --> 00:51:21,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing.</font>

985
00:51:25,339 --> 00:51:26,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, jeez.</font>

986
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:29,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stifler?</font>

987
00:51:31,095 --> 00:51:32,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stifler?</font>

988
00:51:32,263 --> 00:51:33,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Up here, dude.</font>

989
00:51:34,765 --> 00:51:36,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you I was an expert.</font>

990
00:51:37,268 --> 00:51:38,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit.</font>

991
00:51:39,145 --> 00:51:40,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell is going on now?</font>

992
00:51:43,691 --> 00:51:44,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

993
00:51:44,942 --> 00:51:46,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Want to go to
a Justin Bieber concert?</font>

994
00:51:46,903 --> 00:51:48,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh... Jim?</font>

995
00:51:48,613 --> 00:51:49,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stifler, come on. Come on!</font>

996
00:51:50,156 --> 00:51:51,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go.</font>

997
00:51:52,575 --> 00:51:55,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You and you, stay here.</font>

998
00:51:55,828 --> 00:51:57,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't push me.</font>

999
00:51:58,331 --> 00:51:59,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa! Oh, my God.</font>

1000
00:52:02,793 --> 00:52:03,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah!</font>

1001
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kara, where
the hell are you?</font>

1002
00:52:05,338 --> 00:52:07,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm on my way to
your place and...</font>

1003
00:52:10,468 --> 00:52:11,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the...</font>

1004
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:12,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck!</font>

1005
00:52:18,309 --> 00:52:20,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell is going on?</font>

1006
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:22,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God!</font>

1007
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:37,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, stud.</font>

1008
00:52:37,328 --> 00:52:39,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you'd never...</font>

1009
00:53:00,268 --> 00:53:04,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit, shit.
We were supposed to...</font>

1010
00:53:04,563 --> 00:53:05,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's fine.</font>

1011
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:07,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? No, God, it's not fine.</font>

1012
00:53:08,734 --> 00:53:11,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shoot! I'm so sorry, Michelle.
I really... I wanted to, I just...</font>

1013
00:53:11,904 --> 00:53:13,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to drop
Ev at my grandma's</font>

1014
00:53:14,031 --> 00:53:16,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'll be back
this afternoon.</font>

1015
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Michelle, hold on.</font>

1016
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:23,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jim, I'm worried.</font>

1017
00:53:24,583 --> 00:53:26,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you worried about?</font>

1018
00:53:26,335 --> 00:53:30,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just we're like so out of sync.</font>

1019
00:53:32,258 --> 00:53:33,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just...</font>

1020
00:53:34,051 --> 00:53:36,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know how much longer
we can go on like this.</font>

1021
00:53:39,056 --> 00:53:43,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I promise you I will do everything
I can to make it up to you.</font>

1022
00:53:43,602 --> 00:53:44,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay?</font>

1023
00:53:45,062 --> 00:53:46,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stifler's having
a party tonight.</font>

1024
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:52,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I know that doesn't
sound romantic or anything,</font>

1025
00:53:52,403 --> 00:53:57,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but remember our first time
was at a Stifler party.</font>

1026
00:53:58,075 --> 00:53:59,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You made me your bitch.</font>

1027
00:54:02,246 --> 00:54:04,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Yes, I did.</font>

1028
00:54:24,143 --> 00:54:25,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me when, okay?</font>

1029
00:54:25,978 --> 00:54:27,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck?</font>

1030
00:54:36,614 --> 00:54:37,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm.</font>

1031
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:57,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, Mia.</font>

1032
00:54:58,094 --> 00:55:01,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's a free spirit.</font>

1033
00:55:01,305 --> 00:55:02,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's something else.</font>

1034
00:55:02,973 --> 00:55:04,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, she is.</font>

1035
00:55:06,519 --> 00:55:09,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute, do I sense
a little jealousy there?</font>

1036
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Mmm-mmm. No?</font>

1037
00:55:11,148 --> 00:55:13,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, don't forget, you were
the one who broke up with me</font>

1038
00:55:13,484 --> 00:55:14,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before you went to med school.</font>

1039
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:19,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you were moving to LA
with no return in sight.</font>

1040
00:55:19,198 --> 00:55:21,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't blame me for
wanting to settle down.</font>

1041
00:55:21,992 --> 00:55:24,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I don't.</font>

1042
00:55:24,995 --> 00:55:27,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just don't
want you to settle.</font>

1043
00:55:28,374 --> 00:55:30,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look who's jealous now.</font>

1044
00:55:30,709 --> 00:55:33,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wouldn't call being
with Ron "settling."</font>

1045
00:55:33,671 --> 00:55:36,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, he's gorgeous on paper.</font>

1046
00:55:36,549 --> 00:55:37,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that supposed to mean?</font>

1047
00:55:38,342 --> 00:55:40,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing. Um...</font>

1048
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:44,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. You're right.</font>

1049
00:55:46,016 --> 00:55:47,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am a bit jealous.</font>

1050
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, it's funny.</font>

1051
00:55:51,814 --> 00:55:55,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In some ways, you've
completely changed,</font>

1052
00:55:55,526 --> 00:55:58,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and, in other ways,
you're exactly the same.</font>

1053
00:55:58,654 --> 00:56:00,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heather, you can believe this,</font>

1054
00:56:00,865 --> 00:56:02,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">nothing's changed.</font>

1055
00:56:04,827 --> 00:56:05,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

1056
00:56:06,036 --> 00:56:07,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chris Ostreicher?</font>

1057
00:56:08,205 --> 00:56:09,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, girls.</font>

1058
00:56:09,457 --> 00:56:10,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I get a pic?</font>

1059
00:56:10,749 --> 00:56:11,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>

1060
00:56:17,506 --> 00:56:18,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad?</font>

1061
00:56:20,259 --> 00:56:21,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, hey, Dad. Hey, Jim.</font>

1062
00:56:21,719 --> 00:56:23,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just going to
run out for a sec.</font>

1063
00:56:23,512 --> 00:56:26,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was just watching
your old Bar Mitzvah tape.</font>

1064
00:56:28,225 --> 00:56:29,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I got
your Jew scarf!</i></font>

1065
00:56:29,935 --> 00:56:31,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Give it back, Stifler.</i></font>

1066
00:56:34,356 --> 00:56:39,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I think I'm the happiest man
in the world thanks to you.</i></font>

1067
00:56:45,367 --> 00:56:47,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I miss her too, Dad.</font>

1068
00:56:49,288 --> 00:56:50,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

1069
00:56:58,797 --> 00:57:02,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, you've always been
there to give me advice.</font>

1070
00:57:03,093 --> 00:57:06,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if there's anything
that you want to talk about,</font>

1071
00:57:08,098 --> 00:57:09,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here for you.</font>

1072
00:57:11,143 --> 00:57:13,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I don't think
there's anything</font>

1073
00:57:13,687 --> 00:57:16,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really need
to talk about, Jim.</font>

1074
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:20,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think maybe
it's time for you to</font>

1075
00:57:20,569 --> 00:57:21,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">meet someone else?</font>

1076
00:57:23,113 --> 00:57:25,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, it's okay.</font>

1077
00:57:25,324 --> 00:57:29,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you're going through
is perfectly natural.</font>

1078
00:57:30,371 --> 00:57:33,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, there are
services out there...</font>

1079
00:57:33,332 --> 00:57:34,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Services? Yeah.</font>

1080
00:57:34,458 --> 00:57:35,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like what?</font>

1081
00:57:35,834 --> 00:57:37,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A happy ending? What's that?</font>

1082
00:57:37,795 --> 00:57:38,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I won't go there.</font>

1083
00:57:38,921 --> 00:57:39,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

1084
00:57:40,047 --> 00:57:42,049
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't need that...
I don't need that kind of massage, Jim.</font>

1085
00:57:42,132 --> 00:57:43,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not what I was...</font>

1086
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:44,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because, you know what,
it's dangerous.</font>

1087
00:57:44,969 --> 00:57:46,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you can pick things up.</font>

1088
00:57:46,512 --> 00:57:48,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't even wanna know
what you can pick up.</font>

1089
00:57:48,556 --> 00:57:50,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Talk to your uncle Mort.
I'd rather not.</font>

1090
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:51,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was in the hospital
for 2 weeks.</font>

1091
00:57:51,433 --> 00:57:52,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's disgusting.</font>

1092
00:57:56,146 --> 00:57:58,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was talking about</font>

1093
00:57:59,358 --> 00:58:00,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">online dating services.</font>

1094
00:58:02,653 --> 00:58:03,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Jim.</font>

1095
00:58:03,862 --> 00:58:06,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, right, at my age?
I don't think so.</font>

1096
00:58:07,074 --> 00:58:09,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been out of
the game for so long.</font>

1097
00:58:09,159 --> 00:58:10,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There wasn't even
a game back then.</font>

1098
00:58:10,744 --> 00:58:14,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, don't worry.
I'll hook you up.</font>

1099
00:58:20,004 --> 00:58:21,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have those photos?</font>

1100
00:58:21,672 --> 00:58:23,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here you go.</font>

1101
00:58:23,591 --> 00:58:24,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

1102
00:58:24,675 --> 00:58:25,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Oh.</font>

1103
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:27,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We might need something
a little more recent.</font>

1104
00:58:27,344 --> 00:58:28,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think?</font>

1105
00:58:30,014 --> 00:58:33,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have something
that's a bit sexier?</font>

1106
00:58:33,934 --> 00:58:35,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gotcha.</font>

1107
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:40,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you...</font>

1108
00:58:40,858 --> 00:58:42,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Favorite music.</font>

1109
00:58:42,359 --> 00:58:43,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um...</font>

1110
00:58:43,611 --> 00:58:44,988
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Herman's Hermits.</font>

1111
00:58:45,362 --> 00:58:46,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1112
00:58:47,197 --> 00:58:48,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh...</font>

1113
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:51,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Girls, one at a time, please.</font>

1114
00:58:51,535 --> 00:58:52,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Interests and hobbies.</font>

1115
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:53,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sudoku.</font>

1116
00:58:54,121 --> 00:58:55,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll come back to this one.</font>

1117
00:59:02,129 --> 00:59:04,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are we sure we're
not taking off too much?</font>

1118
00:59:04,298 --> 00:59:07,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These caterpillars are
kind of my trademark.</font>

1119
00:59:08,886 --> 00:59:11,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay... Perfect.</font>

1120
00:59:11,722 --> 00:59:14,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take a look. I'm nervous.</font>

1121
00:59:18,062 --> 00:59:21,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that's fantastic!</font>

1122
00:59:21,231 --> 00:59:24,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is a great look for me!</font>

1123
00:59:24,485 --> 00:59:25,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>

1124
00:59:25,569 --> 00:59:29,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leaner lines.
I still have mobility.</font>

1125
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:32,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't I do
this 30 years ago?</font>

1126
00:59:32,242 --> 00:59:33,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looking good.</font>

1127
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:35,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't we test this
new look out tonight?</font>

1128
00:59:35,704 --> 00:59:36,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, um...</font>

1129
00:59:37,081 --> 00:59:40,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The thing is, Stifler is
throwing a party tonight.</font>

1130
00:59:40,751 --> 00:59:42,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! Well, another time.</font>

1131
00:59:42,753 --> 00:59:44,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you could come with us.</font>

1132
00:59:45,589 --> 00:59:46,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It would be nice to
get out of the house.</font>

1133
00:59:47,049 --> 00:59:48,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do have to warn you, though,</font>

1134
00:59:48,759 --> 00:59:52,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stifler's parties
can get a little.</font>

1135
00:59:52,179 --> 00:59:53,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wild.</font>

1136
01:00:05,567 --> 01:00:08,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck is this?</font>

1137
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:11,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who the hell changed the music?</font>

1138
01:00:11,949 --> 01:00:14,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, we thought this
was more baby-friendly.</font>

1139
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:17,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't we? Yes, we did.</font>

1140
01:00:17,371 --> 01:00:19,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stifmeister!</font>

1141
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:22,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ch!</font>

1142
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:23,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bluck!</font>

1143
01:00:24,378 --> 01:00:25,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chester!</font>

1144
01:00:28,674 --> 01:00:30,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What have you
cock-smokers been up to?</font>

1145
01:00:30,551 --> 01:00:32,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, we just got engaged.
Yeah.</font>

1146
01:00:33,011 --> 01:00:35,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? That's so fucking gay.</font>

1147
01:00:37,391 --> 01:00:39,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, Stifler, we are gay.</font>

1148
01:00:40,144 --> 01:00:41,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Half the lacrosse team was gay.</font>

1149
01:00:41,645 --> 01:00:43,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must have
known that, right?</font>

1150
01:00:43,897 --> 01:00:46,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, you walked in on Doug
and Barry in the shower.</font>

1151
01:00:47,776 --> 01:00:49,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just thought
they were wrestling.</font>

1152
01:00:50,757 --> 01:00:53,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They were
- Yeah they definitely were</font>

1153
01:00:53,684 --> 01:00:56,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They just wasn't a
loser that night</font>

1154
01:00:56,025 --> 01:00:56,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

1155
01:01:02,105 --> 01:01:04,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are we sure this is Stifler's?</font>

1156
01:01:04,775 --> 01:01:05,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh!</font>

1157
01:01:05,859 --> 01:01:07,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hors d'oeuvres!</font>

1158
01:01:07,319 --> 01:01:08,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you give
this to our host, son?</font>

1159
01:01:10,948 --> 01:01:11,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

1160
01:01:12,616 --> 01:01:14,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God! Look who it is.</font>

1161
01:01:15,077 --> 01:01:16,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

1162
01:01:18,288 --> 01:01:19,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry for interrupting
you guys last night.</font>

1163
01:01:20,165 --> 01:01:22,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bravo, by the way.</font>

1164
01:01:22,209 --> 01:01:24,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Most wives stop doing that
after they get the ring.</font>

1165
01:01:25,128 --> 01:01:26,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you talking about?
Did you change your hair color?</font>

1166
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:32,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, is your buddy, the other
MILF guy, here tonight?</font>

1167
01:01:32,636 --> 01:01:34,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you always come
to these things together.</font>

1168
01:01:35,305 --> 01:01:39,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's just say that friendship
is a two-way street.</font>

1169
01:01:40,852 --> 01:01:42,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>

1170
01:01:44,523 --> 01:01:45,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm.</font>

1171
01:01:45,816 --> 01:01:47,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Could this party get any lamer?</font>

1172
01:01:48,735 --> 01:01:50,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not so bad.</font>

1173
01:01:51,822 --> 01:01:53,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want some E?</font>

1174
01:01:53,657 --> 01:01:55,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Why do you have that?</font>

1175
01:01:55,826 --> 01:01:58,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one else here
probably has any.</font>

1176
01:01:58,370 --> 01:01:59,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you sure you
don't want one?</font>

1177
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:00,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1178
01:02:00,706 --> 01:02:01,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No... Yes.</font>

1179
01:02:01,957 --> 01:02:02,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1180
01:02:03,041 --> 01:02:05,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Fine. More for me, then.</font>

1181
01:02:10,716 --> 01:02:12,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And there they are.</font>

1182
01:02:12,175 --> 01:02:13,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Finchy.</font>

1183
01:02:14,386 --> 01:02:17,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you guys are. Look around.
Can you believe this shit?</font>

1184
01:02:18,056 --> 01:02:19,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, man. Nice work.</font>

1185
01:02:20,017 --> 01:02:21,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For you.</font>

1186
01:02:21,518 --> 01:02:23,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell am I
supposed to do with this?</font>

1187
01:02:23,437 --> 01:02:24,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's called wine, Stifler.</font>

1188
01:02:25,063 --> 01:02:26,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, no,
not at my party.</font>

1189
01:02:26,773 --> 01:02:28,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to get us some shots.</font>

1190
01:02:29,484 --> 01:02:30,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Kev.</font>

1191
01:02:30,611 --> 01:02:32,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I talk to you
guys for a sec?</font>

1192
01:02:32,529 --> 01:02:34,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, sure. Wait here,
I'll be right back.</font>

1193
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you brought the goods?</font>

1194
01:02:38,452 --> 01:02:39,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right here.</font>

1195
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:41,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to see.</font>

1196
01:02:43,874 --> 01:02:46,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the...
Where did those fuckers go?</font>

1197
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:48,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, Steven.</font>

1198
01:02:48,754 --> 01:02:50,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Levenstein. Yes.</font>

1199
01:02:50,631 --> 01:02:51,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You made it.</font>

1200
01:02:51,882 --> 01:02:54,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is so great to see
all you kids back in town.</font>

1201
01:02:54,593 --> 01:02:55,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm.</font>

1202
01:02:55,719 --> 01:02:59,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what a terrific soiree
you're throwing here tonight.</font>

1203
01:02:59,264 --> 01:03:01,107
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just wonderful!</font>

1204
01:03:01,266 --> 01:03:04,941
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what?
I'm going to get you fucked up.</font>

1205
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:06,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm? Have a shot.</font>

1206
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! No, no, no.</font>

1207
01:03:08,231 --> 01:03:11,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think so, Steven.
I'm not much of a drinker.</font>

1208
01:03:11,777 --> 01:03:13,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drink it. Drink it!
Drink it! No, I can't.</font>

1209
01:03:13,904 --> 01:03:15,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drink it! Drink it!</font>

1210
01:03:17,407 --> 01:03:18,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Awesome! Let's do another one.</font>

1211
01:03:18,575 --> 01:03:19,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think so.</font>

1212
01:03:19,826 --> 01:03:22,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, Kev, you don't know for
sure if anything happened.</font>

1213
01:03:22,245 --> 01:03:25,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I woke up next to her in bed,
and all our clothes were off.</font>

1214
01:03:25,749 --> 01:03:28,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, whatever happened,
I feel guilty.</font>

1215
01:03:28,585 --> 01:03:30,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kevin, in France,</font>

1216

<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's only considered cheating if
your wife catches you in the act.</font>

1217

<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's here.</font>

1218
01:03:40,764 --> 01:03:42,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gotta go.</font>

1219
01:03:42,474 --> 01:03:44,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, get ready.</font>

1220
01:03:44,267 --> 01:03:46,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait for it. Wait for it!</font>

1221
01:03:46,812 --> 01:03:47,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait for it!</font>

1222
01:03:47,938 --> 01:03:49,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here she comes!</font>

1223
01:03:49,898 --> 01:03:50,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

1224
01:03:51,024 --> 01:03:52,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck yeah, Mr. Levenstein!</font>

1225
01:03:52,943 --> 01:03:55,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The name is Noah, motherfucker.</font>

1226
01:03:58,281 --> 01:03:59,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm.</font>

1227
01:03:59,449 --> 01:04:00,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Feel the sofa.</font>

1228
01:04:00,951 --> 01:04:03,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's so smooth.</font>

1229
01:04:04,121 --> 01:04:06,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It feels like a Smurf's ass.</font>

1230
01:04:07,124 --> 01:04:08,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you feel it?</font>

1231
01:04:08,625 --> 01:04:11,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Mia, can you...</font>

1232
01:04:13,171 --> 01:04:15,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, guys. Sorry we're late.</font>

1233
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:16,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>

1234
01:04:17,384 --> 01:04:20,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I got a treat for everybody.
I picked something up.</font>

1235
01:04:20,637 --> 01:04:23,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Celebrity Dance Off, Season Six.
My man, Chris Ostreicher.</i></font>

1236
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:24,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

1237
01:04:27,018 --> 01:04:29,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to watch this.</font>

1238
01:04:29,187 --> 01:04:31,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who wants to see my
baby shake his booty?</font>

1239
01:04:33,483 --> 01:04:34,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know I do.</font>

1240
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:37,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">JDate? You have
to be kidding me.</font>

1241

<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you want quality vag, you
have to go out into the wild.</font>

01:04:41,032 --> 01:04:42,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Vag"?</font>

1243
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:45,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that, a half a vagina?</font>

1244
01:04:46,455 --> 01:04:49,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, in my day
we called it a beaver.</font>

1245
01:04:49,499 --> 01:04:53,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And let me tell you something,
I snagged a pelt or two.</font>

1246
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,550

1247
01:04:54,671 --> 01:04:55,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad?</font>

1248
01:04:55,756 --> 01:04:58,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Jim, your dad is so
much cooler than you.</font>

1249
01:04:58,258 --> 01:04:59,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stifler, please stop
getting my dad drunk.</font>

1250
01:05:00,010 --> 01:05:02,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, he's just trying
to get me some vag.</font>

1251
01:05:02,429 --> 01:05:03,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, come on.</font>

1252
01:05:03,513 --> 01:05:05,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah! Hey, hey.</font>

1253
01:05:05,348 --> 01:05:07,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let the man make
his own decisions.</font>

1254
01:05:07,184 --> 01:05:08,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop. Come on.</font>

1255
01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:09,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't listen to him.</font>

1256
01:05:09,978 --> 01:05:12,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to dust off
that old dick of yours,</font>

1257
01:05:12,481 --> 01:05:14,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">go out there, and get some ass.</font>

1258
01:05:14,649 --> 01:05:15,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! Just go out there.</font>

1259
01:05:15,901 --> 01:05:17,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I Will.</font>

1260
01:05:17,194 --> 01:05:19,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, stop, okay?
It's exactly what I'm gonna...</font>

1261
01:05:20,071 --> 01:05:22,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, but you have had a
little too much to drink tonight,</font>

1262
01:05:22,866 --> 01:05:24,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'm not letting you...
No, no.</font>

1263
01:05:24,201 --> 01:05:27,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, son, I haven't
hardly had one drink.</font>

1264
01:05:27,746 --> 01:05:30,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you know I love you.</font>

1265
01:05:30,207 --> 01:05:34,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do love you, but you need to</font>

1266
01:05:35,837 --> 01:05:36,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">chillax.</font>

1267
01:05:37,422 --> 01:05:39,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Chillax"?
Dad, where are you going?</font>

1268
01:05:39,591 --> 01:05:41,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you see him? Jim! Jim!</font>

1269
01:05:41,218 --> 01:05:42,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let him go.
Let him have some fun.</font>

1270
01:05:44,054 --> 01:05:47,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now we can have some fun.</font>

1271
01:05:48,934 --> 01:05:49,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

1272
01:05:51,728 --> 01:05:53,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>

1273
01:05:53,355 --> 01:05:55,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, excuse me.</font>

1274
01:05:55,398 --> 01:05:56,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this a washroom?</font>

1275
01:05:57,943 --> 01:05:59,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't even occur to you
that you're self-centered</font>

1276
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:02,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because you are so
self-centered and...</font>

1277
01:06:03,073 --> 01:06:04,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what?
Hold on a second.</font>

1278
01:06:06,910 --> 01:06:08,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I help you?</font>

1279
01:06:09,579 --> 01:06:10,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who might you be?</font>

1280
01:06:11,122 --> 01:06:12,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Stifler's mom.</font>

1281
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:14,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

1282
01:06:14,793 --> 01:06:16,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Jim's dad.</font>

1283
01:06:17,921 --> 01:06:19,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Later, fucker.</font>

1284
01:06:38,275 --> 01:06:41,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God, this is the most
ridiculous thing I've ever seen.</font>

1285
01:06:48,869 --> 01:06:50,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, you have an amazing body!</font>

1286
01:06:50,829 --> 01:06:55,300
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Everybody, raise the roof

1287
01:06:55,375 --> 01:06:57,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You have really been
bringing it all season long.</i></font>

America thinks you done brought it.</i></font>

1289
01:07:02,632 --> 01:07:04,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You ready? Let's do it.</i></font>

1290
01:07:04,134 --> 01:07:05,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Let's see the results.</i></font>

1291
01:07:11,266 --> 01:07:13,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?
Gilbert Gottfried and not you?</font>

1292
01:07:14,144 --> 01:07:15,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fucking bullshit!</font>

1293
01:07:15,437 --> 01:07:17,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Chris, I'm so sorry, man.</i></font>

1294
01:07:17,731 --> 01:07:22,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Well, we saw you jam.
Now, it's time to scram.</i></font>

1296
01:07:24,738 --> 01:07:27,241

probably end it there.</font>

1297
01:07:27,407 --> 01:07:29,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? No, are you kidding?
I haven't seen this.</font>

1298
01:07:29,826 --> 01:07:32,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I think what I've
learned is to be true</i></font>

1300
01:07:33,496 --> 01:07:36,500

dancing is, it's truth.</i></font>

1301
01:07:36,666 --> 01:07:38,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And maybe,</i></font>

1302
01:07:39,002 --> 01:07:42,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>if we just danced
a little bit more,</i></font>

1303
01:07:42,339 --> 01:07:45,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>there would be no more wars.</i></font>

1304
01:07:47,594 --> 01:07:49,016

1309
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you want my opinion,
I think you got cheated.</font>

1310
01:08:11,451 --> 01:08:12,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay?</font>

1311
01:08:13,536 --> 01:08:15,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,</font>

1312
01:08:15,956 --> 01:08:18,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you lose something that's important
to you, it doesn't feel very good.</font>

01:08:19,584 --> 01:08:21,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oz, it's just a show.</font>

1314
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:24,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not talking about the show.</font>

1315
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:34,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Heather,
you down there?</font>

1316
01:08:34,683 --> 01:08:36,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um, coming!</font>

1317
01:08:37,185 --> 01:08:38,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

1318
01:08:38,728 --> 01:08:40,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait here, I'll be right back.</font>

1319
01:08:41,690 --> 01:08:43,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't tell you how many times
I walked into Steven's room</font>

1320
01:08:44,025 --> 01:08:46,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I caught him in the
middle of sex with some girl.</font>

1321
01:08:47,028 --> 01:08:49,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least he was with
a real, live human girl.</font>

1322
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:51,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you talking about?</font>

1323
01:08:51,282 --> 01:08:55,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I walked into the kitchen once,
and I saw Jim humping a pie.</font>

1324
01:08:57,497 --> 01:09:01,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He turned the damn thing into a
crumble in about 2 seconds.</font>

1325
01:09:05,839 --> 01:09:07,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can top that.</font>

1326
01:09:07,590 --> 01:09:08,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I once walked into my bedroom</font>

1327
01:09:08,883 --> 01:09:12,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I caught Steven sticking
my hairbrush up his ass.</font>

1328
01:09:16,016 --> 01:09:18,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, and it wasn't
the handle side, either.</font>

1329
01:09:21,730 --> 01:09:22,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

1330
01:09:24,107 --> 01:09:26,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no.</font>

1331
01:09:27,944 --> 01:09:32,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A pretty lady like you shouldn't
be drinking quite so much.</font>

1332
01:09:33,158 --> 01:09:34,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And neither should I.</font>

1333
01:09:41,124 --> 01:09:42,467
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about a joint, then?</font>

1334
01:09:45,503 --> 01:09:49,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't have to wait 13 years
to see each other again.</font>

1335
01:09:49,799 --> 01:09:51,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, true.</font>

1336
01:09:51,551 --> 01:09:55,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I guess I could come along
on one of your adventures.</font>

1337
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:58,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am I good sidekick material?</font>

1338
01:09:58,641 --> 01:09:59,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sidekick?</font>

1339
01:09:59,768 --> 01:10:04,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you are a lot more
than sidekick material.</font>

1340
01:10:10,487 --> 01:10:12,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is everything okay?</font>

1341
01:10:14,991 --> 01:10:16,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's better than ever.</font>

1342
01:10:19,829 --> 01:10:20,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm. Mmm.</font>

1343
01:10:20,955 --> 01:10:22,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, wait, wait.</font>

1344
01:10:22,457 --> 01:10:26,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think we're dressed
appropriately for the occasion.</font>

1345
01:10:26,461 --> 01:10:28,008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put that on.</font>

1346
01:10:28,171 --> 01:10:29,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, where are you going?</font>

1347
01:10:29,589 --> 01:10:32,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To change. Be back soon.</font>

1348
01:10:43,019 --> 01:10:44,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dudes!</font>

1349
01:10:46,022 --> 01:10:47,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's up, bro?</font>

1350
01:10:48,566 --> 01:10:50,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Big Stiffy?</font>

1351
01:10:50,693 --> 01:10:52,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blowjob Lipstein.</font>

1352
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:58,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you have to be
fucking kidding me!</font>

1353
01:10:58,743 --> 01:10:59,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me?</font>

1354
01:11:06,584 --> 01:11:07,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1355
01:11:08,253 --> 01:11:11,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell are you doing?
You just expect me to blow you?</font>

1356
01:11:11,506 --> 01:11:12,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

1357
01:11:12,715 --> 01:11:14,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm out of here.</font>

1358
01:11:14,259 --> 01:11:15,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. Wait, Wait!</font>

1359
01:11:15,927 --> 01:11:17,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I get it.</font>

1360
01:11:17,554 --> 01:11:19,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're self-conscious
about your body.</font>

1361
01:11:19,931 --> 01:11:22,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry. I was going to
shut the lights off anyway.</font>

1362
01:11:22,934 --> 01:11:25,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are the same douchebag
that you were in high school.</font>

1363
01:11:26,062 --> 01:11:29,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just expect me to do
everything while I get nothing?</font>

1364
01:11:29,941 --> 01:11:30,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Later.</font>

1365
01:11:31,025 --> 01:11:32,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no!</font>

1366
01:11:36,406 --> 01:11:38,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's make a deal.</font>

1367
01:11:39,576 --> 01:11:42,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll get you off,
you get me off.</font>

1368
01:11:43,121 --> 01:11:44,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you say?</font>

1369
01:11:45,331 --> 01:11:46,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fine.</font>

1370
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:49,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I am putting you to work.</font>

1371
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:50,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit.</font>

1372
01:11:52,005 --> 01:11:53,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chow time!</font>

1373
01:11:57,177 --> 01:11:59,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you are!</font>

1374
01:11:59,137 --> 01:12:01,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been looking
all over for you.</font>

1375
01:12:02,098 --> 01:12:04,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, we really need to...</font>

1376
01:12:06,436 --> 01:12:07,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

1377
01:12:08,104 --> 01:12:09,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Taking what's mine.</font>

1378
01:12:12,108 --> 01:12:14,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I just wanted to hear
the sound of your voice.</font>

1379
01:12:15,069 --> 01:12:17,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw, is everything okay?
You seem stressed.</font>

1380
01:12:18,031 --> 01:12:19,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stressed?</font>

1381
01:12:21,492 --> 01:12:23,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you are!</font>

1382
01:12:24,787 --> 01:12:26,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no.</font>

1383
01:12:26,998 --> 01:12:30,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to go right now, but I'll
call you back in a little bit.</font>

1384
01:12:30,877 --> 01:12:34,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Okay. And don't worry, I won't
watch Gossip Girl without you.</i></font>

1385
01:12:34,255 --> 01:12:35,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I miss you, babe.</i></font>

1386
01:12:35,298 --> 01:12:36,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I miss you, too.</font>

1387
01:12:40,136 --> 01:12:43,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, Vicky,
about last night,</font>

1388
01:12:44,515 --> 01:12:45,812
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that wasn't me.</font>

1389
01:12:45,975 --> 01:12:48,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With what happened...</font>

1390
01:12:48,728 --> 01:12:51,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.
It might be normal in your world.</font>

1391
01:12:51,481 --> 01:12:53,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think happened?</font>

1392
01:12:53,691 --> 01:12:56,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, all our clothes
were on the floor.</font>

1393
01:12:56,194 --> 01:12:57,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, because
they were soaking wet</font>

1394
01:12:57,570 --> 01:12:59,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from when you got drunk
and fell in the lake.</font>

1395
01:12:59,405 --> 01:13:00,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I took care of you.</font>

1396
01:13:01,074 --> 01:13:03,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, we didn't have sex?</font>

1397
01:13:04,077 --> 01:13:05,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course not.</font>

1398
01:13:05,870 --> 01:13:07,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, thank God!</font>

1399
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:13,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm glad you think
so highly of me.</font>

1400
01:13:14,128 --> 01:13:15,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1401
01:13:15,672 --> 01:13:17,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Vicky, wait.</font>

1402
01:13:18,258 --> 01:13:21,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah!
Oh, my God!</font>

1403
01:13:21,511 --> 01:13:23,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mia, stop.</font>

1404
01:13:24,681 --> 01:13:26,024
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh my God, yeah!</font>

1405
01:13:26,182 --> 01:13:27,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mia, get off!</font>

1406
01:13:27,475 --> 01:13:29,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm about to! I'm about to!</font>

1407
01:13:31,604 --> 01:13:32,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heather.</font>

1408
01:13:35,024 --> 01:13:36,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell?</font>

1409
01:13:37,193 --> 01:13:38,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have something going on
with this skank?</font>

1410
01:13:40,363 --> 01:13:43,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you calling a
skank, you fucking bitch?</font>

1411
01:13:43,574 --> 01:13:45,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa! Whoa!</font>

1412
01:13:45,743 --> 01:13:46,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop it! Stop!</font>

1413
01:13:47,078 --> 01:13:48,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop it!</font>

1414
01:13:49,706 --> 01:13:51,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">OW! What the fuck?</font>

1415
01:13:51,624 --> 01:13:53,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my extension, you bitch!</font>

1416
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:55,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You motherfucker!</font>

1417
01:13:55,753 --> 01:13:58,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Mia! Wait a minute!</font>

1418
01:13:59,257 --> 01:14:02,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By the way,
I fucked Mario Lopez!</font>

1419
01:14:06,723 --> 01:14:07,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh...</font>

1420
01:14:10,643 --> 01:14:13,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, it's my turn now.</font>

1421
01:14:13,396 --> 01:14:15,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-uh. Not this time.</font>

1422
01:14:16,065 --> 01:14:17,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, what about our deal?</font>

1423
01:14:18,026 --> 01:14:21,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now you know how it
feels, Big Stiffy.</font>

1424
01:14:28,786 --> 01:14:30,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gross!</font>

1425
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:37,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fucking yuck</font>

1426
01:14:54,631 --> 01:14:57,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't actually think I'd
fall asleep again, did you?</font>

1427
01:14:58,051 --> 01:14:59,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As long as you're mine,
I'm happy.</font>

1428
01:15:00,053 --> 01:15:01,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus, Kara.
What are you doing here?</font>

1429
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:04,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your creepy friend invited
me and all my girlfriends.</font>

1430
01:15:04,265 --> 01:15:06,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice outfit, by the way.
Very kinky.</font>

1431
01:15:07,519 --> 01:15:08,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit.</font>

1432
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:10,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry. I locked it.</font>

1433
01:15:13,566 --> 01:15:14,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Jesus.</font>

1434
01:15:18,488 --> 01:15:21,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell kind of freaky
shit is going on in here?</font>

1435
01:15:21,699 --> 01:15:22,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">AJ, what are you doing here?</font>

1436
01:15:23,117 --> 01:15:24,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I followed you.
I had to see it with my own eyes.</font>

1437
01:15:25,161 --> 01:15:28,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First you fuck with my jet ski,
then you fuck my girlfriend?</font>

1438
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:31,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! God, no! Nothing happened.</font>

1439
01:15:31,376 --> 01:15:32,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going down, Sandler.</font>

1440
01:15:32,585 --> 01:15:34,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sandler? What the...</font>

1441
01:15:34,212 --> 01:15:35,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus Christ!</font>

1442
01:15:37,757 --> 01:15:39,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to kill you!</font>

1443
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:43,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jim, what the fuck
are you wearing?</font>

1444
01:15:43,263 --> 01:15:45,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I can explain
everything! Jesus!</font>

1445
01:15:46,474 --> 01:15:47,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on! Shit!</font>

1446
01:15:47,642 --> 01:15:49,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get up, gimp!</font>

1447
01:15:49,352 --> 01:15:51,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, I'm not
fighting you, okay?</font>

1448
01:15:51,479 --> 01:15:53,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is silly. I'm an adult.</font>

1449
01:15:53,189 --> 01:15:54,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, really?</font>

1450
01:15:54,357 --> 01:15:56,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because to me you look
like a little bitch pussy.</font>

1451
01:15:57,485 --> 01:15:59,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't be a pussy, Jim.</font>

1452
01:15:59,404 --> 01:16:01,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, AJ, just calm down, okay?</font>

1453
01:16:02,156 --> 01:16:05,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What makes you little fuckers think you can
crash one of the Stifmeister's parties?</font>

1454
01:16:05,952 --> 01:16:08,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you just refer to yourself
as "the Stifmeister"?</font>

1455
01:16:08,955 --> 01:16:12,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because that's the
lamest name ever!</font>

1456
01:16:14,669 --> 01:16:16,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to fucking kill you.</font>

1457
01:16:16,963 --> 01:16:17,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring it on.</font>

1458
01:16:18,006 --> 01:16:19,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Steve, come on, this is...</font>

1459
01:16:24,846 --> 01:16:26,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where do you think
you're going?</font>

1460
01:16:31,519 --> 01:16:34,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't mess with
the Class of '99, bitch!</font>

1461
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:36,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Finch!</font>

1462
01:16:37,275 --> 01:16:38,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't hurt my friend!</font>

1463
01:16:53,374 --> 01:16:54,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

1464
01:16:54,667 --> 01:16:57,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get off my husband,
you little piece of shit!</font>

1465
01:17:09,641 --> 01:17:12,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, crap! It's the fuzz!</font>

1466
01:17:13,394 --> 01:17:15,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to get out.
How do you get out?</font>

1467
01:17:15,813 --> 01:17:17,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need an escape route!</font>

1468
01:17:17,190 --> 01:17:18,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit!</font>

1469
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:19,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want to be with him?</font>

1470
01:17:20,026 --> 01:17:22,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fine! He's all yours.</font>

1471
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:24,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, man!</font>

1472
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:28,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jim, what's going on?</font>

1473
01:17:28,785 --> 01:17:30,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am so sorry for all
of this. I can explain.</font>

1474
01:17:31,537 --> 01:17:33,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Last night I ran into
Kara, our neighbor.</font>

1475
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:37,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was too drunk to drive,
so I drove her home.</font>

1476
01:17:37,251 --> 01:17:42,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And she started taking off her
clothes, and touching my...</font>

1477
01:17:42,382 --> 01:17:45,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I know it doesn't sound
good, but nothing happened, okay?</font>

1478
01:17:45,968 --> 01:17:48,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care about her at all!</font>

1479
01:17:48,221 --> 01:17:50,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks a lot.</font>

1480
01:17:51,182 --> 01:17:53,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, Kara, wait.
I didn't mean...</font>

1481
01:17:53,851 --> 01:17:55,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, Michelle.
Hold on, hold on.</font>

1482
01:17:55,728 --> 01:17:57,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not what you think, okay?</font>

1483
01:17:57,313 --> 01:18:01,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I swear, I was just trying to
do the right thing, and I...</font>

1484
01:18:01,901 --> 01:18:04,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to believe
me, Michelle, please.</font>

1485
01:18:05,446 --> 01:18:08,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whether I believe you or not,</font>

1486
01:18:08,783 --> 01:18:10,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm disappointed.</font>

1487
01:18:10,576 --> 01:18:13,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to stay
with my grandmother.</font>

1488
01:18:13,204 --> 01:18:14,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold it, Michelle.</font>

1489
01:18:14,288 --> 01:18:15,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Jim.</font>

1490
01:18:15,915 --> 01:18:17,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, the fight's over, guys.</font>

1491
01:18:17,625 --> 01:18:19,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not here to stop a fight.</font>

1492
01:18:19,293 --> 01:18:21,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're here about
that stolen motorcycle.</font>

1493
01:18:21,796 --> 01:18:23,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like the VIN
numbers match up.</font>

1494
01:18:23,631 --> 01:18:24,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Paul Finch.</font>

1495
01:18:25,049 --> 01:18:26,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're under arrest.</font>

1496
01:18:28,136 --> 01:18:29,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Awesome!</font>

1497
01:18:29,721 --> 01:18:30,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me, officer.</font>

1498
01:18:30,972 --> 01:18:33,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He won that bike betting on
the World Cup in Argentina.</font>

1499
01:18:33,249 --> 01:18:35,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You made some sort of mistake.</font>

1500
01:18:35,601 --> 01:18:37,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Paul, what's going on?
What is this about?</font>

1501
01:18:37,854 --> 01:18:39,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Paul.</font>

1502
01:18:39,188 --> 01:18:40,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Finch, just tell them.</font>

1503
01:18:40,648 --> 01:18:41,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Paul!</font>

1504
01:18:43,067 --> 01:18:46,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, shitbreak, when you're
getting rammed by your cellmate tonight,</font>

1505
01:18:46,738 --> 01:18:47,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">think of Kevin.</font>

1506
01:18:51,909 --> 01:18:53,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Michelle, can I just... Please!</font>

1507
01:18:57,832 --> 01:18:58,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

1508
01:18:59,625 --> 01:19:00,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah!</font>

1509
01:19:01,544 --> 01:19:02,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad? Ah!</font>

1510
01:19:07,341 --> 01:19:08,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad?</font>

1511
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:10,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, what are you doing?</font>

1512
01:19:10,845 --> 01:19:13,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't see me!
I'm not here!</font>

1513
01:19:13,765 --> 01:19:14,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not here!</font>

1514
01:19:16,517 --> 01:19:17,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is he all right?</font>

1515
01:19:18,352 --> 01:19:20,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

1516
01:19:20,521 --> 01:19:22,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are we going
to do about Finch?</font>

1517
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:24,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck Finch. Let him
spend the night in jail.</font>

1518
01:19:24,609 --> 01:19:25,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Stifler!</font>

1519
01:19:25,902 --> 01:19:27,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some friend you are.</font>

1520
01:19:29,447 --> 01:19:30,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about you guys?</font>

1521
01:19:31,115 --> 01:19:34,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't call me,
you don't e-mail,</font>

1522
01:19:34,243 --> 01:19:36,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you don't comment
on my Facebook page.</font>

1523
01:19:36,454 --> 01:19:38,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys didn't even let me know you
were coming back for the reunion.</font>

1524
01:19:38,915 --> 01:19:42,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because we knew, somehow, you would
find a way to screw things up.</font>

1525
01:19:42,710 --> 01:19:44,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'm sorry, Jim.</font>

1526
01:19:44,545 --> 01:19:46,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanted us to have
a fucking fun time</font>

1527
01:19:46,214 --> 01:19:47,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this weekend,
like we did in high school.</font>

1528
01:19:47,882 --> 01:19:49,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we're not in
high school any more.</font>

1529
01:19:50,051 --> 01:19:51,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are so trapped
in the past, Stifler.</font>

1530
01:19:51,719 --> 01:19:54,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When are you going to realize that things
will never be the way they used to be?</font>

1531
01:20:01,896 --> 01:20:03,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fine.</font>

1532
01:20:04,315 --> 01:20:06,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guess the party's over.</font>

1533
01:20:08,402 --> 01:20:09,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dicks.</font>

1534
01:20:42,186 --> 01:20:44,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that was a great party.</font>

1535
01:20:44,939 --> 01:20:47,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I honestly think I had fun.</font>

1536
01:20:49,277 --> 01:20:51,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that makes one of us.</font>

1537
01:20:54,323 --> 01:20:55,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you heard from Michelle?</font>

1538
01:20:55,825 --> 01:20:59,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. She doesn't
want to talk to me.</font>

1539
01:20:59,370 --> 01:21:01,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about the reunion tonight?</font>

1540
01:21:01,247 --> 01:21:03,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She said she may
or may not come.</font>

1541
01:21:03,541 --> 01:21:05,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on with you two?</font>

1542
01:21:05,501 --> 01:21:07,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jim, is there anything
you want to talk about?</font>

1543
01:21:11,090 --> 01:21:12,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1544
01:21:13,009 --> 01:21:14,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um...</font>

1545
01:21:15,344 --> 01:21:17,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How often</font>

1546
01:21:18,097 --> 01:21:21,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">did you and Mom...</font>

1547
01:21:24,604 --> 01:21:25,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know?</font>

1548
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:28,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that what this is about?</font>

1549
01:21:28,149 --> 01:21:29,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You and Michelle
haven't been...</font>

1550
01:21:30,151 --> 01:21:31,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not lately, no.</font>

1551
01:21:32,069 --> 01:21:33,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh...</font>

1552
01:21:35,656 --> 01:21:37,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ls it</font>

1553
01:21:37,658 --> 01:21:39,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">an erectile problem?</font>

1554
01:21:39,994 --> 01:21:44,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because sometimes you
can buy a little time</font>

1555
01:21:44,498 --> 01:21:45,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with a well-placed thumb.</font>

1556
01:21:45,875 --> 01:21:47,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God. I'm just saying.</font>

1557
01:21:47,835 --> 01:21:49,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think that's it.
That's not it?</font>

1558
01:21:50,004 --> 01:21:54,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! That's something to keep in your
back pocket, because that's a no-fail.</font>

1559
01:21:54,967 --> 01:21:56,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, let's be done with that.</font>

1560
01:21:56,802 --> 01:22:00,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, things in that
department were fine.</font>

1561
01:22:01,432 --> 01:22:03,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then Evan was born</font>

1562
01:22:03,726 --> 01:22:06,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we kind of stopped.</font>

1563
01:22:06,854 --> 01:22:10,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they haven't really
picked up since, you know?</font>

1564
01:22:11,484 --> 01:22:14,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is not a problem,
so do not worry.</font>

1565
01:22:14,862 --> 01:22:16,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You understand?
Yeah, listen, Jim.</font>

1566
01:22:16,864 --> 01:22:18,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before you were born,</font>

1567
01:22:18,407 --> 01:22:21,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your mother and I,
we would do it every day.</font>

1568
01:22:21,452 --> 01:22:22,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't need this.</font>

1569
01:22:22,536 --> 01:22:24,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes two or
3 times a day.</font>

1570
01:22:24,956 --> 01:22:28,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is back in the '70s.
A lot of experimentation was going on.</font>

1571
01:22:28,751 --> 01:22:33,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your mother favored something she
called, "diving for dollars."</font>

1572
01:22:33,714 --> 01:22:36,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit. I'm sorry,
I don't need...</font>

1573
01:22:36,676 --> 01:22:39,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's fine, we can...</font>

1574
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:40,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't have to
go on with that.</font>

1575
01:22:40,554 --> 01:22:46,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But my point is, when you have a
kid, you become a dad and a mom.</font>

1576
01:22:46,394 --> 01:22:50,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it's very important not to
stop being a husband and a wife.</font>

1577
01:22:51,190 --> 01:22:54,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if you do that,
the sex will come.</font>

1578
01:22:56,821 --> 01:22:58,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That actually
makes a lot of sense.</font>

1579
01:22:58,447 --> 01:23:01,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you can't just wait for
the two of you to be alone.</font>

1580
01:23:01,993 --> 01:23:05,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to make
your own alone time.</font>

1581
01:23:05,663 --> 01:23:09,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you think you went to
Hebrew school 3 times a week?</font>

1582
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:13,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sundays, noon to 3?
Tuesdays, 4 to 7?</font>

1583
01:23:13,629 --> 01:23:14,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I get it, Dad.</font>

1584
01:23:15,006 --> 01:23:17,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you get it,
then why the questions?</font>

1585
01:23:17,383 --> 01:23:18,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

1586
01:23:18,551 --> 01:23:20,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going through this, I am sorry.
I should be listening.</font>

1587
01:23:20,803 --> 01:23:23,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm overreacting.
I'm sorry.</font>

1588
01:23:27,643 --> 01:23:29,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

1589
01:23:29,895 --> 01:23:31,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Again. Really.</font>

1590
01:23:35,234 --> 01:23:36,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anytime.</font>

1591
01:23:41,323 --> 01:23:42,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome, you guys.</font>

1592
01:23:42,992 --> 01:23:46,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, find your nametag, find
out what table you're sitting at.</font>

1593
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:48,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ashley, so good to see you!
Oh, my God.</font>

1594
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:52,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy! Oh, my God,
you're looking so svelte.</font>

1595
01:23:52,251 --> 01:23:55,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You used to be morbidly obese.
I was concerned.</font>

1596
01:23:55,463 --> 01:23:56,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

1597
01:23:56,630 --> 01:23:57,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, guys.</font>

1598
01:23:57,798 --> 01:23:59,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Jim. Oz.</font>

1599
01:23:59,759 --> 01:24:00,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is Mia?</font>

1600
01:24:01,010 --> 01:24:03,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She flew out this morning.</font>

1601
01:24:03,304 --> 01:24:05,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. I'm sorry, man.</font>

1602
01:24:06,474 --> 01:24:07,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about Michelle?</font>

1603
01:24:08,768 --> 01:24:10,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am not sure yet.</font>

1604
01:24:11,353 --> 01:24:12,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Finch!</font>

1605
01:24:12,855 --> 01:24:16,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened? I called the police
department a thousand times.</font>

1606
01:24:16,275 --> 01:24:21,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I appreciate that, Kevin.
But my mom, actually, bailed me out.</font>

1607
01:24:22,907 --> 01:24:24,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, I screwed up.</font>

1608
01:24:24,575 --> 01:24:26,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That bike belongs to my boss.</font>

1609
01:24:26,827 --> 01:24:31,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I was promised a raise,
and I didn't get it, so I</font>

1610
01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:32,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">simply borrowed it.</font>

1611
01:24:33,334 --> 01:24:35,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The truth is that my life
isn't interesting at all.</font>

1612
01:24:36,337 --> 01:24:40,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am an assistant manager at a
Staples in Bayonne, New Jersey.</font>

1613
01:24:40,591 --> 01:24:43,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I lied to my best friends,
and I'm sorry.</font>

1614
01:24:45,221 --> 01:24:48,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, Finch,
just because you sold out</font>

1615
01:24:48,390 --> 01:24:51,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and got a boring job
like most of us,</font>

1616
01:24:51,477 --> 01:24:53,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that doesn't mean you
should be embarrassed.</font>

1617
01:24:53,187 --> 01:24:55,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, come on, man.
None of that shit matters.</font>

1618
01:24:56,857 --> 01:24:58,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That means a lot, gentlemen.</font>

1619
01:24:58,275 --> 01:24:59,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about your arm?</font>

1620
01:24:59,735 --> 01:25:00,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

1621
01:25:02,363 --> 01:25:05,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I spilled coffee on myself
while I was driving.</font>

1622
01:25:05,282 --> 01:25:06,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1623
01:25:07,201 --> 01:25:08,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It hurt like a bitch, though.</font>

1624
01:25:08,994 --> 01:25:11,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll bet. Jesus, Finch.</font>

1625
01:25:12,206 --> 01:25:14,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, hey, check this
out, you guys.</font>

1626
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:18,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Crazy, huh? Look at us.</font>

1627
01:25:18,212 --> 01:25:19,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A lot of memories.</font>

1628
01:25:21,382 --> 01:25:23,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Steve Stifler."</font>

1629
01:25:23,968 --> 01:25:26,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Hopes to keep the party
going with his boys."</font>

1630
01:25:30,850 --> 01:25:32,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any sign of him yet?</font>

1631
01:25:32,768 --> 01:25:34,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think
he's going to show.</font>

1632
01:25:50,035 --> 01:25:51,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stifler?</font>

1633
01:25:55,332 --> 01:25:56,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd you find me?</font>

1634
01:25:56,584 --> 01:25:57,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We asked your mom.</font>

1635
01:25:58,752 --> 01:26:01,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no. I didn't do anything.</font>

1636
01:26:02,590 --> 01:26:07,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We wanted to apologize
for what we said last night.</font>

1637
01:26:07,928 --> 01:26:08,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We didn't mean it.</font>

1638
01:26:10,347 --> 01:26:14,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you did.
I get it, you guys think I'm a dick.</font>

1639
01:26:18,939 --> 01:26:21,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Well,</font>

1640
01:26:22,109 --> 01:26:24,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">maybe you are kind of a dick.</font>

1641
01:26:25,446 --> 01:26:26,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But,</font>

1642
01:26:27,531 --> 01:26:29,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're a fun dick.</font>

1643
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:32,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you're our dick.</font>

1644
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:37,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, man. You were one of the biggest
reasons that high school was awesome.</font>

1645
01:26:38,125 --> 01:26:40,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, high school was awesome.</font>

1646
01:26:40,961 --> 01:26:43,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then we graduated and everybody
started getting jobs</font>

1647
01:26:43,923 --> 01:26:46,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and getting married
and having kids</font>

1648
01:26:46,217 --> 01:26:48,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and all that other stupid shit.</font>

1649
01:26:48,761 --> 01:26:52,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, look at me.
I'm the bitch of this place.</font>

1650
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, Stifler, none of
our lives are perfect.</font>

1651
01:26:54,767 --> 01:26:55,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Especially mine.</font>

1652
01:26:56,936 --> 01:27:01,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what do you say we keep this party
going, and hit up this reunion together?</font>

1653
01:27:03,150 --> 01:27:05,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell is going on here?</font>

1654
01:27:05,861 --> 01:27:09,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.
This is the jackass.</font>

1655
01:27:09,782 --> 01:27:12,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not even close to being
finished and you're up here</font>

1656
01:27:12,326 --> 01:27:14,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"chilling with your posse"?</font>

1657
01:27:14,578 --> 01:27:15,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, we can explain.</font>

1658
01:27:15,955 --> 01:27:17,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Kevin.</font>

1659
01:27:18,666 --> 01:27:19,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Allow me.</font>

1660
01:27:19,833 --> 01:27:22,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, Kevin, allow him.</font>

1661
01:27:22,544 --> 01:27:23,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This better be good, Stafler.</font>

1662
01:27:24,338 --> 01:27:26,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Stifler, fucker.</font>

1663
01:27:26,674 --> 01:27:30,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, wow.
Who the hell do you think you are?</font>

1664
01:27:30,844 --> 01:27:34,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you acting tough in front
of your girlfriend? Huh?</font>

1665
01:27:34,431 --> 01:27:36,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because we both know she's
only with you for your money.</font>

1666
01:27:37,268 --> 01:27:38,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Definitely not for your dick.</font>

1667
01:27:38,769 --> 01:27:40,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because anybody that's
peed next to you</font>

1668
01:27:40,688 --> 01:27:42,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">knows it's the size of
a leprechaun's pinkie.</font>

1669
01:27:44,108 --> 01:27:46,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not true.</font>

1670
01:27:46,193 --> 01:27:49,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"That's not
true." Oh, yeah, it is.</font>

1671
01:27:50,625 --> 01:27:54,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, just because you got a fancy
office and I don't even have a desk</font>

1672
01:27:54,545 --> 01:27:56,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">doesn't change
who we really are.</font>

1673
01:27:57,006 --> 01:28:00,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The truth is,
you're still a dork,</font>

1674
01:28:00,718 --> 01:28:02,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I can still kick your ass.</font>

1675
01:28:03,554 --> 01:28:05,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm not going to.</font>

1676
01:28:05,389 --> 01:28:06,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know why?</font>

1677
01:28:07,058 --> 01:28:09,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I'm the
fucking Stifmeister.</font>

1678
01:28:09,227 --> 01:28:14,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if you even look at me again.
I will shit in your briefcase</font>

1679
01:28:14,502 --> 01:28:15,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dudes?</font>

1680
01:28:22,147 --> 01:28:25,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By the way, I had no clue what I
was doing with any of this shit,</font>

1681
01:28:25,984 --> 01:28:28,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so you got a lot of work to do.</font>

1682
01:29:03,021 --> 01:29:04,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Surprise! Hey! You made it.</font>

1683
01:29:04,856 --> 01:29:06,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>

1684
01:29:06,274 --> 01:29:07,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think about
the Lions this year?</font>

1685
01:29:07,402 --> 01:29:08,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They got a shot?</font>

1686
01:29:08,693 --> 01:29:11,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll see if their
offensive line can hold.</font>

1687
01:29:11,238 --> 01:29:13,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Are you planning on being on
- All Stars?</i></font>

1688
01:29:14,032 --> 01:29:15,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I actually haven't
thought much about that.</font>

1689
01:29:16,118 --> 01:29:18,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should think about it.</font>

1690
01:29:22,791 --> 01:29:26,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, guys,
you'll have to excuse me.</font>

1691
01:29:30,715 --> 01:29:32,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I cut in?</font>

1692
01:29:32,634 --> 01:29:35,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.
Can you promise to keep your shirt on?</font>

1693
01:29:36,096 --> 01:29:38,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, buddy, I'm busting balls.
Huh?</font>

1694
01:29:38,974 --> 01:29:41,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, of course.</font>

1695
01:29:41,393 --> 01:29:42,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll get us some drinks.</font>

1696
01:29:42,811 --> 01:29:43,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1697
01:29:45,730 --> 01:29:48,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

1698
01:29:49,317 --> 01:29:51,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shouldn't you be dancing
with your girlfriend?</font>

1699
01:29:51,778 --> 01:29:52,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>

1700
01:29:53,905 --> 01:29:57,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mia and I are over.</font>

1701
01:29:58,577 --> 01:30:03,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She wanted me
to be someone else.</font>

1702
01:30:03,790 --> 01:30:07,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something that I
don't want to be.</font>

1703
01:30:08,587 --> 01:30:10,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want, Chris?</font>

1704
01:30:11,256 --> 01:30:13,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heather, I want this.</font>

1705
01:30:14,009 --> 01:30:15,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want us.</font>

1706
01:30:16,761 --> 01:30:20,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about your career? LA?</font>

1707
01:30:20,432 --> 01:30:23,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I know that it's crazy.</font>

1708
01:30:23,894 --> 01:30:28,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I don't have all the answers
right now, but I see you,</font>

1709
01:30:30,025 --> 01:30:31,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I just know</font>

1710
01:30:32,736 --> 01:30:33,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you.</font>

1711
01:30:35,447 --> 01:30:36,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you.</font>

1712
01:30:37,782 --> 01:30:39,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you.</font>

1713
01:30:46,124 --> 01:30:47,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I'm skiing down a mountain.</font>

1714
01:30:47,292 --> 01:30:48,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guy has a heart
attack right there.</font>

1715
01:30:48,793 --> 01:30:51,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Saved his life.
It was a big story, you can Google it.</font>

1716
01:30:51,838 --> 01:30:52,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it was.</font>

1717
01:30:53,131 --> 01:30:54,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bet.</font>

1718
01:30:55,467 --> 01:30:57,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit! Excuse me.</font>

1719
01:30:57,802 --> 01:31:00,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, excuse me.
What the hell is going on?</font>

1720
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:01,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ron, I can explain.</font>

1721
01:31:01,848 --> 01:31:03,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously, this guy?</font>

1722
01:31:03,391 --> 01:31:05,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a fucking heart surgeon,
this guy's not even on ESPN.</font>

1723
01:31:05,810 --> 01:31:07,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, take it easy, Ron.</font>

1724
01:31:07,771 --> 01:31:10,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you going to do?
Hit me, Oz? Huh?</font>

1725
01:31:10,273 --> 01:31:13,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I got an idea.
What about a dance-off? Huh?</font>

1726
01:31:14,152 --> 01:31:16,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't a reality show, okay?
This is the real world.</font>

1727
01:31:17,155 --> 01:31:20,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You take one swing at me, I will
sue you for all you're worth.</font>

1728
01:31:24,955 --> 01:31:27,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not worth jack shit, Dron.</font>

1729
01:31:30,001 --> 01:31:31,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm your dick.</font>

1730
01:31:34,214 --> 01:31:35,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dropped him!</font>

1731
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:36,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was awesome!</font>

1732
01:31:36,508 --> 01:31:38,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, we had a blast
the other night.</font>

1733
01:31:39,844 --> 01:31:42,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you ever thought about
being a party planner?</font>

1734
01:31:42,847 --> 01:31:45,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because we want you
to plan our wedding.</font>

1735
01:31:45,350 --> 01:31:46,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say yes.</font>

1736
01:31:47,894 --> 01:31:49,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah! I'd love to.</font>

1737
01:31:49,938 --> 01:31:51,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice! Oh, my God.</font>

1738
01:31:51,898 --> 01:31:53,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks! This is great, man.</font>

1739
01:31:53,775 --> 01:31:56,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you so much.
Thank you, bro.</font>

1740
01:31:56,569 --> 01:31:58,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're welcome. Thank you.</font>

1741
01:32:03,827 --> 01:32:04,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to tell you something.</font>

1742
01:32:04,995 --> 01:32:06,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have to explain.</font>

1743
01:32:06,705 --> 01:32:11,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, Paul, I didn't like you
because you climbed the Alps,</font>

1744
01:32:11,209 --> 01:32:13,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or killed a camel
with your bare hands.</font>

1745
01:32:13,545 --> 01:32:16,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I liked you because you were
still the same good guy</font>

1746
01:32:16,131 --> 01:32:18,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that was actually nice
to me in high school.</font>

1747
01:32:19,009 --> 01:32:20,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm still that guy.</font>

1748
01:32:20,677 --> 01:32:22,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really am.</font>

1749
01:32:23,138 --> 01:32:25,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, the last time I
was here was for prom.</font>

1750
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:28,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't have a date.</font>

1751
01:32:28,476 --> 01:32:29,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Neither did I.</font>

1752
01:32:32,397 --> 01:32:33,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to get a drink.</font>

1753
01:32:33,648 --> 01:32:35,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1754
01:32:35,317 --> 01:32:36,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was my dancing that bad?</font>

1755
01:32:36,443 --> 01:32:37,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1756
01:32:37,902 --> 01:32:39,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kev! Hey!</font>

1757
01:32:39,654 --> 01:32:40,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Jess!</font>

1758
01:32:40,739 --> 01:32:42,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow. Look, you have a beard!
It looks great.</font>

1759
01:32:42,615 --> 01:32:44,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks. I'm kidding.</font>

1760
01:32:44,701 --> 01:32:47,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's just get this out of the way.</font>

1761
01:32:47,245 --> 01:32:48,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a lesbian now, and
this is my girlfriend.</font>

1762
01:32:48,873 --> 01:32:50,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Ingrid.</font>

1763
01:32:50,665 --> 01:32:52,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.</font>

1764
01:32:52,542 --> 01:32:55,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lesbians? I knew it!</font>

1765
01:32:55,295 --> 01:32:57,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you guys
make out and prove it.</font>

1766
01:32:57,255 --> 01:33:00,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must be Stifler.
I've heard a lot about you. Ow!</font>

1767
01:33:00,425 --> 01:33:01,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mostly negative.</font>

1768
01:33:02,093 --> 01:33:04,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cool, dude. What the fuck?</font>

1769
01:33:04,262 --> 01:33:06,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jessica, it's good to see you.</font>

1770
01:33:06,222 --> 01:33:07,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it wasn't.</font>

1771
01:33:07,432 --> 01:33:08,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the...</font>

1772
01:33:09,017 --> 01:33:11,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, Kev, I think you
should go talk to Vicky.</font>

1773
01:33:12,020 --> 01:33:14,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's really upset over there.</font>

1774
01:33:14,939 --> 01:33:17,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, thanks.</font>

1775
01:33:17,108 --> 01:33:18,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice to meet you.</font>

1776
01:33:18,568 --> 01:33:20,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be a real man,
you have a beard now.</font>

1777
01:33:24,741 --> 01:33:26,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kevin, don't. I'm fine.</font>

1778
01:33:26,868 --> 01:33:30,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.
I was a complete jerk last night.</font>

1779
01:33:30,622 --> 01:33:33,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was just upset that you would
think that I would do that</font>

1780
01:33:33,666 --> 01:33:35,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">knowing that you're married.</font>

1781
01:33:35,835 --> 01:33:37,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you wouldn't.</font>

1782
01:33:37,670 --> 01:33:41,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honestly, that was more
about me being nervous.</font>

1783
01:33:42,342 --> 01:33:46,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seeing you again, all these
old feelings came up, and...</font>

1784
01:33:46,596 --> 01:33:49,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know, I guess
I just felt guilty.</font>

1785
01:33:50,183 --> 01:33:54,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the fact that I still
have feelings for you</font>

1786
01:33:54,521 --> 01:33:57,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just means that what
we had was special.</font>

1787
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:59,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't get me wrong, all right.</font>

1788
01:33:59,484 --> 01:34:02,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love Ellie
more than anything.</font>

1789
01:34:02,946 --> 01:34:05,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But no matter
how much time passes</font>

1790
01:34:06,199 --> 01:34:08,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you'll always be my first love.</font>

1791
01:34:11,204 --> 01:34:12,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you'll always be mine.</font>

1792
01:34:12,997 --> 01:34:14,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kev. Hey.</font>

1793
01:34:14,207 --> 01:34:16,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to try these
cupcakes, they're awesome.</font>

1794
01:34:16,251 --> 01:34:18,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ellie, this is Vicky.</font>

1795
01:34:18,628 --> 01:34:22,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God! The Vicky?
Kevin has told me so much about you.</font>

1796
01:34:23,007 --> 01:34:26,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a really lucky girl.
He's a great guy.</font>

1797
01:34:27,262 --> 01:34:28,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come dance with us.
No, it's okay.</font>

1798
01:34:29,139 --> 01:34:31,892
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, come on, this is
happening. Come on.</font>

1799
01:35:11,556 --> 01:35:12,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

1800
01:35:13,641 --> 01:35:14,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

1801
01:35:18,062 --> 01:35:19,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My name's Jim.</font>

1802
01:35:20,148 --> 01:35:23,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were in Mr. Lee's
English class together.</font>

1803
01:35:23,568 --> 01:35:24,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

1804
01:35:25,403 --> 01:35:29,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I...
Sorry, I don't remember you.</font>

1805
01:35:29,782 --> 01:35:30,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1806
01:35:32,118 --> 01:35:35,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was the kid who everyone
saw on the Internet.</font>

1807
01:35:35,997 --> 01:35:36,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mmm.</font>

1808
01:35:37,081 --> 01:35:40,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, you're going to
have to be more specific.</font>

1809
01:35:40,460 --> 01:35:42,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I pre-ejaculated twice.</font>

1810
01:35:42,253 --> 01:35:43,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Jim Levenstein! Right!</font>

1811
01:35:43,838 --> 01:35:46,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Levenstein.
Yeah, Jim Levenstein.</font>

1812
01:35:46,466 --> 01:35:48,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I remember. Yeah.</font>

1813
01:35:49,844 --> 01:35:52,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, how have you been
since high school?</font>

1814
01:35:52,639 --> 01:35:55,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pretty good. Yeah, pretty good.
Let's see.</font>

1815
01:35:55,767 --> 01:35:56,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um...</font>

1816
01:35:57,268 --> 01:35:58,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

1817
01:36:00,939 --> 01:36:03,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I married the most wonderful
woman in the world.</font>

1818
01:36:05,735 --> 01:36:07,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we have
the cutest kid ever.</font>

1819
01:36:08,821 --> 01:36:11,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It sounds like
things are perfect.</font>

1820
01:36:12,784 --> 01:36:15,628
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm willing to do whatever
it takes to make it perfect.</font>

1821
01:36:16,871 --> 01:36:21,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that means being the
sexiest husband possible.</font>

1822
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:23,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

1823
01:36:23,836 --> 01:36:25,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Michelle, you look beautiful.</font>

1824
01:36:25,547 --> 01:36:28,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, thanks.</font>

1825
01:36:29,342 --> 01:36:30,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you like to dance?</font>

1826
01:36:31,386 --> 01:36:32,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd love to.</font>

1827
01:36:48,319 --> 01:36:49,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo!</font>

1828
01:36:54,075 --> 01:36:55,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stifler.</font>

1829
01:36:55,493 --> 01:36:58,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sherman? The Sherminator?</font>

1830
01:36:58,621 --> 01:37:00,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck
have you been up to?</font>

1831
01:37:00,498 --> 01:37:02,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Married. Had a kid.</font>

1832
01:37:03,042 --> 01:37:04,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And divorced.</font>

1833
01:37:05,169 --> 01:37:07,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! I'm sorry.</font>

1834
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:09,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I'm sure you are.</font>

1835
01:37:09,132 --> 01:37:12,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, you know what, at least I
got to keep little Furlong.</font>

1836
01:37:13,344 --> 01:37:15,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You named your kid
after Eddie Furlong?</font>

1837
01:37:15,847 --> 01:37:17,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I did. You know why?</font>

1838
01:37:17,348 --> 01:37:20,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because Terminator 2 is still
the greatest film ever made.</font>

1839
01:37:21,019 --> 01:37:24,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, you need
to get banged bad.</font>

1840
01:37:24,548 --> 01:37:28,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna help you out. Your cock can
thank me later. What do you say?</font>

1841
01:37:29,314 --> 01:37:32,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No no. See I'm not going
to fall for that again.</font>

1842
01:37:32,609 --> 01:37:33,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

1843
01:37:33,697 --> 01:37:35,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know I was a bit of
a jerk back in the</font>

1844
01:37:35,983 --> 01:37:38,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">day but I grown up
a lot since then.</font>

1845
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:40,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please. Let me help you out.</font>

1846
01:37:46,230 --> 01:37:52,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sigh. I'm just messing with you.
Get over here you littile rascal.</font>

1847
01:37:53,161 --> 01:37:56,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey lets find you some
puss-puss. Lets go</font>

1848
01:38:02,209 --> 01:38:03,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, we have
to get out of here.</font>

1849
01:38:03,357 --> 01:38:04,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's about time. Yeah.</font>

1850
01:38:10,183 --> 01:38:11,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a lost cause.</font>

1851
01:38:11,476 --> 01:38:14,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All these women are either
married or came with dates.</font>

1852
01:38:15,647 --> 01:38:16,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Loni.</font>

1853
01:38:17,541 --> 01:38:21,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, how would you like
to have your world blown?</font>

1854
01:38:31,457 --> 01:38:33,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Hasta la vista, Stifler.</i></font>

1855
01:38:38,070 --> 01:38:41,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great, everybody's
getting laid but me.</font>

1856
01:38:41,907 --> 01:38:43,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This sucks.</font>

1857
01:38:43,367 --> 01:38:45,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>

1858
01:38:46,437 --> 01:38:48,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi. Hi.</font>

1859
01:38:48,481 --> 01:38:51,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm looking for Paul Finch.
Have you seen him anywhere?</font>

1860
01:38:51,693 --> 01:38:53,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want with Finch?</font>

1861
01:38:53,569 --> 01:38:56,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here to pick him up.
I'm his mom.</font>

1862
01:39:00,201 --> 01:39:01,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Finch has a mom?</font>

1863
01:39:03,705 --> 01:39:06,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, you're Finch's mom?</font>

1864
01:39:07,542 --> 01:39:09,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Are you a friend of his?</font>

1865
01:39:10,044 --> 01:39:11,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah.</font>

1866
01:39:12,255 --> 01:39:13,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Paul is like my best friend.</font>

1867
01:39:13,965 --> 01:39:18,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love him so much.
More now than ever before.</font>

1868
01:39:18,386 --> 01:39:21,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In fact, I can't believe we
haven't met. I'm Steven Stifler.</font>

1869
01:39:24,684 --> 01:39:25,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Rachel.</font>

1870
01:39:27,645 --> 01:39:29,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? What is it?</font>

1871
01:39:29,856 --> 01:39:33,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just got this feeling like something
really bad is about to happen.</font>

1872
01:39:33,776 --> 01:39:38,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry.
I'll be as quiet as a church mouse.</font>

1873
01:39:43,244 --> 01:39:44,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Jim!</font>

1874
01:39:48,374 --> 01:39:49,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

1875
01:39:51,836 --> 01:39:52,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you so bad.</font>

1876
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:54,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you have no idea!</font>

1877
01:39:55,423 --> 01:39:57,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God! Oh, God!</font>

1878
01:39:57,633 --> 01:40:01,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God, there it is.
I don't think I can hold it any more.</font>

1879
01:40:01,262 --> 01:40:02,263
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold it in!</font>

1880
01:40:02,346 --> 01:40:04,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, I will.</font>

1881
01:40:04,515 --> 01:40:05,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just forgot
how awesome this is.</font>

1882
01:40:05,808 --> 01:40:07,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah, I need this.</font>

1883
01:40:10,772 --> 01:40:13,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God, Michelle!
Fuck, I love you!</font>

1884
01:40:13,524 --> 01:40:14,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jim?</font>

1885
01:40:16,861 --> 01:40:17,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nadia?</font>

1886
01:40:20,072 --> 01:40:21,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

1887
01:40:22,116 --> 01:40:25,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. You are busy, yes?</font>

1888
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:27,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Yes.</font>

1889
01:40:27,288 --> 01:40:28,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah, yeah.</font>

1890
01:40:29,123 --> 01:40:32,127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nadia, it's so nice to see you.</font>

1891
01:40:32,502 --> 01:40:35,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But do you think you
could give us a minute?</font>

1892
01:40:35,338 --> 01:40:36,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3.</font>

1893
01:40:36,380 --> 01:40:37,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 minutes.</font>

1894
01:40:37,548 --> 01:40:41,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay! So nice you
are still together.</font>

1895
01:40:41,260 --> 01:40:42,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw!</font>

1896
01:40:42,345 --> 01:40:44,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I see you've gotten
much better at this.</font>

1897
01:40:45,431 --> 01:40:47,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, thanks.</font>

1898
01:40:52,563 --> 01:40:55,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Jim?
He looks nothing like me.</font>

1899
01:40:56,943 --> 01:41:02,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, when I was in high
school, I dated a lacrosse player.</font>

1900
01:41:02,323 --> 01:41:04,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In fact, I dated a few of them.</font>

1901
01:41:04,367 --> 01:41:06,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't say.</font>

1902
01:41:06,536 --> 01:41:09,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I always wanted Paul
to be more into sports.</font>

1903
01:41:09,872 --> 01:41:12,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But he was never
that interested.</font>

1904
01:41:13,084 --> 01:41:14,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have to sugarcoat it.</font>

1905
01:41:14,919 --> 01:41:16,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Finch was a klutz.</font>

1906
01:41:18,756 --> 01:41:21,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I guess he was, but he
did not get that from me.</font>

1907
01:41:21,884 --> 01:41:24,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was head cheerleader.</font>

1908
01:41:25,096 --> 01:41:28,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if there's anything I
learned from lacrosse players,</font>

1909
01:41:28,266 --> 01:41:31,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's that I like
to handle a stick</font>

1910
01:41:33,479 --> 01:41:36,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and cradle those balls.</font>

1911
01:41:39,277 --> 01:41:40,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you.</font>

1912
01:41:41,445 --> 01:41:43,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you ready for me, Stifler?</font>

1913
01:41:48,202 --> 01:41:49,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah!</font>

1914
01:41:51,038 --> 01:41:52,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go.</font>

1915
01:41:52,790 --> 01:41:54,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Michelle.</font>

1916
01:41:54,876 --> 01:41:56,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God, Michelle.</font>

1917
01:41:57,378 --> 01:41:59,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are amazing!</font>

1918
01:42:00,172 --> 01:42:01,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Better than the bathtub?</font>

1919
01:42:01,716 --> 01:42:02,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Much.</font>

1920
01:42:04,552 --> 01:42:06,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Better than this?</font>

1921
01:42:06,637 --> 01:42:07,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh!</font>

1922
01:42:11,058 --> 01:42:12,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>

1923
01:42:14,061 --> 01:42:15,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, take those off!</font>

1924
01:42:16,147 --> 01:42:17,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We shouldn't
be doing this.</font>

1925
01:42:17,607 --> 01:42:18,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, we should.</font>

1926
01:42:18,774 --> 01:42:20,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Stifler.</font>

1927
01:42:20,776 --> 01:42:22,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Finch's mom!</font>

1928
01:42:23,821 --> 01:42:25,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call me the Stifmeister!</font>

1929
01:42:25,323 --> 01:42:27,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you are the Stifmeister.</font>

1930
01:42:29,243 --> 01:42:30,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">MILF?</font>

1931
01:42:37,168 --> 01:42:38,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Finch's mom!</font>

1932
01:42:39,003 --> 01:42:40,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">MILF.</font>

1933
01:42:41,631 --> 01:42:42,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">MILF.</font>

1934
01:42:46,427 --> 01:42:47,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me I'm the best.</font>

1935
01:42:47,845 --> 01:42:49,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are the best!</font>

1936
01:42:50,348 --> 01:42:51,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">MILF.</font>

1937
01:42:52,642 --> 01:42:54,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">MILF. MILF.</font>

1938
01:42:55,645 --> 01:42:56,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Finch's mom!</font>

1939
01:42:57,480 --> 01:43:02,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">MILF! MILF! MILF!</font>

1940
01:43:04,862 --> 01:43:06,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes! Yes!</font>

1941
01:43:06,405 --> 01:43:07,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, your
son's such a dork!</font>

1942
01:43:07,907 --> 01:43:09,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop talking about him!</font>

1943
01:43:12,244 --> 01:43:14,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, our first reunion
is officially in the books.</font>

1944
01:43:15,081 --> 01:43:18,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know about you guys, but
my night ended pretty well.</font>

1945
01:43:18,459 --> 01:43:19,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was great.</font>

1946
01:43:19,627 --> 01:43:20,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had a blast.
It was unforgettable.</font>

1947
01:43:21,045 --> 01:43:22,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck yeah!
I jizzed like a racehorse.</font>

1948
01:43:23,464 --> 01:43:25,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened to you at the
end of the night, Stifler?</font>

1949
01:43:25,216 --> 01:43:26,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who did you end up with?</font>

1950
01:43:26,592 --> 01:43:29,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A gentleman never
kisses and tells, Jim.</font>

1951
01:43:32,223 --> 01:43:33,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys?</font>

1952
01:43:35,351 --> 01:43:37,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be right back, okay?</font>

1953
01:43:41,148 --> 01:43:42,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kara!</font>

1954
01:43:48,781 --> 01:43:50,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey-Hey...</font>

1955
01:43:51,659 --> 01:43:54,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I'm sorry about
what I said the other night.</font>

1956
01:43:54,495 --> 01:43:57,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm the one who
should be apologizing.</font>

1957
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:00,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe the way I acted.
I'm so embarrassed.</font>

1958
01:44:00,251 --> 01:44:01,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't be.</font>

1959
01:44:02,211 --> 01:44:05,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I was your age I was
pretty obsessed with sex, too.</font>

1960
01:44:05,589 --> 01:44:06,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

1961
01:44:07,717 --> 01:44:08,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've seen the YouTube clip.</font>

1962
01:44:09,301 --> 01:44:11,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, of course you did.</font>

1963
01:44:11,929 --> 01:44:14,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, thanks for understanding.</font>

1964
01:44:14,306 --> 01:44:17,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was thinking about it,
and you're right.</font>

1965
01:44:17,268 --> 01:44:18,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should really wait
for someone special.</font>

1966
01:44:20,604 --> 01:44:23,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just, it's going to be tough
to find a guy as good as you.</font>

1967
01:44:27,028 --> 01:44:28,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure you will.</font>

1968
01:44:34,952 --> 01:44:37,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel like a whole new
man after this weekend.</font>

1969
01:44:37,121 --> 01:44:38,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kind of sucks
we have to leave, though.</font>

1970
01:44:38,664 --> 01:44:41,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not me. I'm going to take
some time off my job</font>

1971
01:44:41,876 --> 01:44:43,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and stick around here
with Heather for a while.</font>

1972
01:44:43,794 --> 01:44:44,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice!</font>

1973
01:44:44,962 --> 01:44:46,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about you, Finch?</font>

1974
01:44:46,172 --> 01:44:49,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Selena and I, we're planning
a little jaunt to Europe.</font>

1975
01:44:49,550 --> 01:44:52,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just make sure you call your mom.
She misses you.</font>

1976
01:44:53,012 --> 01:44:54,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How would you know?</font>

1977
01:44:56,182 --> 01:44:57,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh...</font>

1978
01:45:00,311 --> 01:45:02,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess this is it, huh?
Back to reality?</font>

1979
01:45:02,396 --> 01:45:04,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We shouldn't wait
until the next reunion.</font>

1980
01:45:04,315 --> 01:45:07,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should try to get
together every year.</font>

1981
01:45:07,526 --> 01:45:10,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you say,
until next time?</font>

1982
01:45:10,237 --> 01:45:12,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Until next time.
Until next time!</font>

1983
01:45:22,124 --> 01:45:23,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I fucked Finch's mom.</font>

1984
01:45:23,542 --> 01:45:24,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1985
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:26,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was that?</font>

1986
01:46:48,377 --> 01:46:49,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hmm?</font>

1987
01:46:50,045 --> 01:46:51,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's this?</font>

1988
01:46:52,756 --> 01:46:54,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, dean No, no, no.</font>

1989
01:46:54,675 --> 01:46:56,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, dear. No!</font>

1990
01:46:56,594 --> 01:46:57,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh!</font>

1991
01:47:03,475 --> 01:47:04,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh...</font>

1992
01:47:05,227 --> 01:47:08,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Oh. Oh.</font>

1993
01:47:08,522 --> 01:47:11,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah. Oh. Oh.</font>

1994
01:47:12,276 --> 01:47:15,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, boy. Oh, boy! Oh, boy!</font>

1995
01:47:15,362 --> 01:47:17,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!</font>

1996
01:47:18,115 --> 01:47:19,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! Oh!</font>

1997
01:47:19,783 --> 01:47:21,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God!</font>

1998
01:47:22,203 --> 01:47:23,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah!</font>

1999
01:47:28,687 --> 01:47:29,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great movie.</font>
