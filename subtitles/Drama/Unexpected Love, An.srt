<i>My Dear Frodo.</i>

3
00:01:11,355 --> 00:01:18,056
<i>You asked me once if I've told you everything
there was to know about my... adventures.</i>

4
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:20,602
<i>And while I can honestly said I have told you the truth.</i>

5
00:01:21,938 --> 00:01:25,098
<i>I may not have told you all of it.</i>

6
00:01:32,901 --> 00:01:34,964
<i>I'm old now, Frodo.</i>

7
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:40,640
<i>I'm not the same hobbit I once was.</i>

8
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:49,314
<i>I think it is time for you to know
what really happened.</i>

9
00:01:51,499 --> 00:01:55,413
<i>It began long ago.</i>

10
00:01:55,524 --> 00:01:58,727
<i>In the land far away to the east.</i>

11
00:01:58,844 --> 00:02:03,775
<i>The like of which
you will not find in the world today.</i>

12
00:02:13,891 --> 00:02:18,801
<i>There was the city of Dale.
Its markets known far and wide.</i>

13
00:02:18,903 --> 00:02:25,021
<i>Full of the bounties of fine and veil.
Peacefull and prosperous.</i>

14
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:32,771
<i>For this city lay before the doors of the greatest kingdom in middle earth.</i>

15
00:02:33,603 --> 00:02:38,283
<i>Erebor. Stonghold of Thrór.</i>

16
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:44,028
<i>King under the mountain.
Mightiest of the dwarf lords.</i>

17
00:02:44,108 --> 00:02:49,668
<i>Thrór ruled with utter surety.
Never doubting his house would endure.</i>

18
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:55,391
<i>For his line laid secure in the lives of his son and grandson.</i>

19
00:02:56,852 --> 00:03:00,308
<i>Ah, Frodo, Erebor.</i>

20
00:03:00,421 --> 00:03:06,615
<i>Built deep with the mountain itself,
The beauty of this fortress city was legend.</i>

21
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:09,009
<i>Its wealth lay in the earth.</i>

22
00:03:09,143 --> 00:03:14,447
<i>Imprecious gem, fumed from rock,
and in great seems of gold,</i>

23
00:03:14,537 --> 00:03:17,485
<i>Running like rivers through stone.</i>

24
00:03:19,663 --> 00:03:23,813
<i>The skill of the dwarves was unequaled.</i>

25
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,794
<i>Fashioning objects of great beauty .</i>

26
00:03:27,863 --> 00:03:31,527
<i>Out of diamond, emerald, ruby and sapphire.</i>

27
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:36,681
<i>Ever they dwelved deeper, down into the dark.</i>

28
00:03:36,871 --> 00:03:39,562
<i>And that is where they found it.</i>

29
00:03:45,045 --> 00:03:48,280
<i>The heart of the mountain.</i>

30
00:03:49,406 --> 00:03:52,128
<i>The Arkenstone.</i>

31
00:03:52,227 --> 00:03:54,680
<i>Thrór named it 'The King's Jewel'.</i>

32
00:03:54,753 --> 00:03:59,605
<i>He took it as a sign, a sign that his right to rule was divine.</i>

33
00:03:59,701 --> 00:04:06,317
<i> All would pay homage to him,
even the great elven king Thranduil. </ i></i>

34
00:04:07,504 --> 00:04:11,805
<i> But the years of peace and plenty
were not to last. </ i></i>

35
00:04:12,737 --> 00:04:19,235
<i> Slowly the days turned sour, and the watchful nights closed in. </ i></i>

36
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:30,189
<i> Thrór's love of gold had grown too fierce. </ i></i>

37
00:04:32,203 --> 00:04:36,292
<i> A sickness had begun to grow within him. </ i></i>

38
00:04:36,895 --> 00:04:40,167
<i> It was a sickness of the mind. </ i></i>

39
00:04:42,165 --> 00:04:48,573
<i> And where sickness thrives,
bad things will follow. </ i></i>

40
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:02,515
<i> The first they heard was the noise
like a hurricane coming down from the north. </ i></i>

41
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:07,776
<i> The pines on the mountain creaked and cracked
in the hot, dry wind. </ i></i>

42
00:05:11,298 --> 00:05:14,468
Balin, sound the alarm.

43
00:05:16,527 --> 00:05:20,186
Call out the Guard, do it now!
- What is it?

44
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:24,895
Dragon.
Dragon!

45
00:05:26,851 --> 00:05:29,758
<i> It was a fire drake from the north. </ i></i>

46
00:05:37,105 --> 00:05:41,034
<i> Smaug had come. </ i></i>

47
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:11,075
<i> Much wrath and death was dealt on that day. </ i></i>

48
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:15,071
For this city of men
meant nothing to Smaug. </ i>

49
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:19,313
<i> His eyes were set on another prize. </ i></i>

50
00:06:23,701 --> 00:06:29,408
<i> For dragons covet gold
with a dark and fierce desire. </ i></i>

51
00:07:11,255 --> 00:07:15,228
<i> Erebor was lost. </ i></i>

52
00:07:18,766 --> 00:07:23,736
<i> For a dragon will guard his plunder,
as long as he lives. </ i></i>

53
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:37,048
Run for your lives.
Help us.

54
00:07:49,523 --> 00:07:55,335
<i> Thranduil would not risk the lives of his kin against the wrath of the dragon. </ i></i>

55
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:57,977
<i> No help came from the elves that day. </ i></i>

56
00:07:59,007 --> 00:08:01,241
<i> Nor any day since. </ i></i>

57
00:08:02,701 --> 00:08:08,643
<i> Robbed of their homeland
The Dwarves of Erebor wandered the wilderness. </ i></i>

58
00:08:08,718 --> 00:08:11,921
<i> A once mighty people
robbed of all. </ i></i>

59
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:20,394
<i> The young dwarf prince took work
where he could find it. Laboring in the villages of men </ i></i>

60
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:25,734
<i> But always he remembered the mountain smoke beneath the moon. </ i></i>

61
00:08:25,822 --> 00:08:29,067
<i> the trees, like torches, blazing bright. </ i></i>

62
00:08:29,188 --> 00:08:35,296
<i> He had seen dragon fire in the sky
and the city turned to ash. </ i></i>

63
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:41,331
<i> And he never forgave, and he never forgot. </ i></i>

64
00:08:46,482 --> 00:08:50,779
<i> That, my dear Frodo, is where I come in. </ i></i>

65
00:08:50,883 --> 00:08:54,295
<i> For quite by chance and the will of
a wizard... </ i></i>

66
00:08:54,412 --> 00:08:58,668
<i> fate decided I would become part of this tale. </ i></i>

67
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,350
<i> It began... Well, it began as you might expect. </ i></i>

68
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:10,371
<i> In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. </ i></i>

69
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:17,202
<i> Not a nasty , dirty, wet hole,
filled with worms and oozy smells. </ i></i>

70
00:09:17,451 --> 00:09:19,765
<i> This was a hobbit hole. </ i></i>

71
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:24,744
<i> And that means good food,
a warm hearth ... </ i></i>

72
00:09:25,256 --> 00:09:28,501
<i> and all the comforts of home. </ i></i>

73
00:10:01,676 --> 00:10:04,208
Thank you.

74
00:10:04,626 --> 00:10:08,963
What's this?
- That is private. Keep your sticky paws off.

75
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,506
It's not ready yet.

76
00:10:12,596 --> 00:10:16,763
Not ready for what?
- Reading.

77
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:24,409
What on earth are these?
- Replies to the party invitations.

78
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,463
Good gracious.
Is it today?

79
00:10:28,576 --> 00:10:34,052
They all said they are coming, except for the Sack-full Bagginses
they demand that you ask them in person.

80
00:10:34,838 --> 00:10:38,168
Are they indeed? Over my dead body.

81
00:10:38,283 --> 00:10:41,751
They'd probably find that quite agreeable.
They seem to think you have tunnels overflowing with gold.

82
00:10:41,734 --> 00:10:45,821
It was one small chest.
Hardly overflowing.

83
00:10:45,928 --> 00:10:50,265
And it still smells of troll.
- What on earth are you doing?

84
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:55,221
Taking precautions.

85
00:10:55,643 --> 00:10:59,558
You know I caught her making off with our silverware once.
- Who?

86
00:10:59,669 --> 00:11:02,995
Lobelia Sack-full Baggins.

87
00:11:03,113 --> 00:11:05,451
She had all my spoons stuffed in her pocket.

88
00:11:05,452 --> 00:11:11,591
Dreadful woman.
Make sure you keep an eye on her after I...

89
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,058
When I'm...when I'm...

90
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:16,650
When you're...what?

91
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,318
It's nothing.
Nothing

92
00:11:28,368 --> 00:11:32,455
You know, some people are beggining to
wonder about you, uncle.

93
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:36,311
They think you're becoming...odd.
- Odd?

94
00:11:37,127 --> 00:11:41,550
Unsociable.
- Unsociable? Me? Nonsense.

95
00:11:41,648 --> 00:11:44,348
Be a good lad and put that on the gate.

96
00:11:53,817 --> 00:11:57,776
Do you think he'll come?
- Who?
Gandalf.

97
00:11:57,882 --> 00:12:01,554
He wouldn't miss a chance to lit off his Wizz Poppers.

98
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,350
He will give us quite a show.
You'll see.

99
00:12:04,342 --> 00:12:08,400
All right then, I'm off.
- Off to where?
East Farthing Woods. I'm going to surprise him.

100
00:12:08,508 --> 00:12:12,260
Well go on then.
You don't want to be late.

101
00:12:16,414 --> 00:12:19,582
He doesn't approve of being late.

102
00:12:20,248 --> 00:12:25,088
<i> Not that I ever was.
In those days I was always on time. </ I></i>

103
00:12:25,906 --> 00:12:29,575
<i> I was entirely respectable. </ i></i>

104
00:12:29,921 --> 00:12:35,712
<i> And nothing unexpected...ever happened. </ i></i>

105
00:12:59,355 --> 00:13:01,733
Good morning.
- What do you mean?

106
00:13:02,228 --> 00:13:07,189
Do you mean to wish me a good morning,
or is it a good morning whether I want it or not?

107
00:13:07,898 --> 00:13:12,938
Or perhaps you mean to say that you feel good
on this particular morning?

108
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:16,946
Or are you simply stating that this is a good morning to be good on?

109
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,280
All of them at once, I suppose.

110
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:30,566
Can I help you?
- That remains to be seen.

111
00:13:32,156 --> 00:13:36,241
I'm looking for someone
to share in an adventure.

112
00:13:39,425 --> 00:13:41,772
An adventure?

113
00:13:42,748 --> 00:13:48,291
No, I don't imagine anyone west of Bree,
would have much interest in adventures.

114
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:53,122
Nasty, disturbing...uncomfortable things.

115
00:13:53,219 --> 00:13:55,507
You'd be late for dinner.

116
00:14:02,727 --> 00:14:04,822
Good morning.

117
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:09,749
To think that I should have lived to be 'Good Morninged'
by Belladonna Took's son...

118
00:14:09,845 --> 00:14:15,093
As if I was selling buttons at the door?
- Beg your pardon?

119
00:14:15,135 --> 00:14:18,429
You've changed.
And not entirely for the better, Bilbo Baggins.

120
00:14:18,545 --> 00:14:23,127
I'm sorry. Do I know you?
- Well, you know my name.
Although you don't remember I belong to it.

121
00:14:23,223 --> 00:14:27,435
I'm Gandalf.
And Gandalf means...

122
00:14:28,888 --> 00:14:30,474
Me.

123
00:14:30,614 --> 00:14:35,070
Gandalf...not Gandalf, the wandering wizard
who makes such excellent fireworks?

124
00:14:35,128 --> 00:14:38,754
Old Took used to have them on midsummer's eve.

125
00:14:39,275 --> 00:14:44,447
No idea you were still in business.
- And where else should I be.

126
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:52,389
Well, I'm pleased to find you remember something about me.

127
00:14:52,494 --> 00:14:55,076
Even if it's only my fireworks.

128
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:00,845
Well, that's decided.
It will be very good for you.

129
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:05,155
And most amuzing for me.
I shall inform the others.

130
00:15:05,262 --> 00:15:08,593
Inform? The who?
No! No... no, wait.

131
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:14,253
We do not want any adventures, here!
Thank you, not today...

132
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:18,945
I suggest you try over the hill
or across the water.

133
00:15:21,107 --> 00:15:23,653
Good morning.

134
00:16:44,314 --> 00:16:48,494
Dwalin, at your service.

135
00:16:51,232 --> 00:16:56,050
Bilbo Baggins... at your service.

136
00:16:56,013 --> 00:16:59,205
Do we know each other?
- No.

137
00:16:59,307 --> 00:17:05,402
Which way you laddy? Is it down here?
- Is what down where?

138
00:17:05,348 --> 00:17:09,384
Supper!
He said there would be food.

139
00:17:09,358 --> 00:17:13,794
And lots of it.
- He... he said? Who said?

140
00:17:24,254 --> 00:17:28,744
Very good this! Any more?
- What? Oh..yes, yes.

141
00:17:36,373 --> 00:17:40,030
Help yourself.

142
00:17:40,955 --> 00:17:46,581
Hmm... it's just that,
I wasn't expecting company.

143
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:52,572
That would be the door.

144
00:17:55,699 --> 00:18:00,189
Balin, at your service.
- Good evening.

145
00:18:00,269 --> 00:18:04,723
Yes! Yes, it is.
Although, I think it might rain later.

146
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,933
Am I late?
- Late for what?

147
00:18:11,871 --> 00:18:14,530
Evening, brother.

148
00:18:15,624 --> 00:18:22,410
By my beard! You are shorter and wider than last we met.
- Wider, not shorter.

149
00:18:22,344 --> 00:18:25,103
Sharp enough for both of us.

150
00:18:35,456 --> 00:18:41,678
Excuse me? Sorry, I hate to interrupt, but the thing is,
I'm not entirely sure you're in the right house.

151
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:44,793
Have you eaten?
- It's not that I don't like visitors.

152
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,296
I like visitors as much as the next Hobbit.

153
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:51,049
But I do like to know them
before they come... visiting.

154
00:18:51,523 --> 00:18:54,551
What is this?
- I don't know,
I just thought it was cheese, it's gone blue.

155
00:18:54,653 --> 00:18:58,244
It's riddled with mold.
- The thing is, I don't know either of you.

156
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,128
Not in the slightest.
I do not mean to be blunt...

157
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:05,689
but I have to speak my mind.
I am sorry.

158
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:13,398
Apology accepted.
Go on now, fill it up brother. Don't stand.

159
00:19:18,193 --> 00:19:24,909
Fili and Kili, at your service.
- You must be Mr. Baggins.

160
00:19:24,845 --> 00:19:26,705
Nope, you can't come in,
you've come to the wrong house.

161
00:19:26,826 --> 00:19:29,592
Has it been canceled?
- No one told us.

162
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:35,012
Cancelled? No, nothing has been canceled.
- That's a relief.

163
00:19:37,002 --> 00:19:40,896
Careful with these, I just had them sharpened.

164
00:19:40,988 --> 00:19:46,407
It's nice, this place. Did you build it yourself?
- No, it's been in the family for years.

165
00:19:46,362 --> 00:19:49,342
That's my mother's dowry box.*
Can you please not do that?

166
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:53,622
Fili and Kili, come on. Give us a hand.
- Mr. Dwalin.

167
00:19:55,429 --> 00:19:58,749
We'll shove this in a hole,
otherwise we'll never get everyone in.

168
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:03,490
Everyone? How many more are there?
- Where do you want it?

169
00:20:03,568 --> 00:20:08,468
Oh no...no, no.
There's nobody home! Go away and bother somebody else.

170
00:20:09,434 --> 00:20:12,878
There are far too many dwarves in my dining room as it is.

171
00:20:12,976 --> 00:20:16,345
If this is some cluttered idea of a joke...

172
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,401
I can only say it is of very poor taste!

173
00:20:30,175 --> 00:20:31,748
Gandalf.

174
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:35,610
Excuse me? Not my wine!
Put that back.

175
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:40,679
Not the jam. Excuse me? Excuse me.
- A tad excessive isn't it? Have you got a cheese knife?

176
00:20:40,755 --> 00:20:46,085
Cheese knife? He eats it by the block.
- No, that's grandpa Mungo's chair.

177
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,330
And so is that, take it back. That is an antique.
Not for sitting on!

178
00:20:57,439 --> 00:21:01,968
Excuse me, Mr. Gandalf,
May I tempt you with a cup of chamomile?

179
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:06,457
Oh, no thank you, Dori.
A little red wine for me, I think.

180
00:21:11,681 --> 00:21:17,411
Where are the tomatoes?
- Fili, Kili.

181
00:21:17,473 --> 00:21:20,732
Oin, Gloin, Dwalin, Balin.

182
00:21:20,827 --> 00:21:23,708
Bifur, Bofur, Bombur.
Dori, Nori ...

183
00:21:23,814 --> 00:21:26,694
Not my prize tomatoes.
- Ori!

184
00:21:28,422 --> 00:21:32,014
Yes, you're quite right, Bifur.

185
00:21:32,718 --> 00:21:36,122
We appear to be one dwarf short.
- He's late is all.

186
00:21:36,221 --> 00:21:39,957
He traveled north to a meeting of our kin.
He'll come.

187
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,960
Mr. Gandalf? A little glass of red wine
as requested.

188
00:21:44,063 --> 00:21:48,887
It has got a fruity bouquet.
- Cheers.

189
00:22:00,674 --> 00:22:03,498
Catch.

190
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,656
Who wants an Ale? Here you go.

191
00:22:20,123 --> 00:22:23,145
Can I have another drink?
Here you go.

192
00:22:44,401 --> 00:22:47,389
Excuse me? That is a doily, not a dish rug.

193
00:22:47,378 --> 00:22:50,748
But it's full of holes.
- It's supposed to look like that. It's croche.

194
00:22:50,699 --> 00:22:53,502
Nice, if you like it.*

195
00:22:53,677 --> 00:22:59,998
Cursed these dwarves.*
- My dear Bilbo, what on earth is the matter?

196
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:03,379
What's the matter? I am surrounded by dwarves.
What are they doing here?

197
00:23:03,372 --> 00:23:07,963
Oh, they're quite a merry gathering,
once you get used to them.

198
00:23:08,091 --> 00:23:12,541
I don't want to get used to them! The state of my kitchen,
there's mud thrown in the carpet.*

199
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:16,787
They pillaged the pantry.
I'm not even gonna tell you what they've done in the bathroom.

200
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,087
They've all but destroyed the plumbing.
I don't understand what they're doing in my house!

201
00:23:20,293 --> 00:23:25,698
Excuse me? I'm sorry to interrupt,
but what should I do with my plate?

202
00:23:26,141 --> 00:23:29,265
Here ya go Ori, give it to me.

203
00:23:33,644 --> 00:23:39,797
That's my mother's china.*
It is over 100 years old.

204
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:46,217
Can you not do that?
You'll blunt them!

205
00:23:46,352 --> 00:23:49,645
Did you hear that, lads?
He says that we'll blunt the knives.

206
00:23:50,108 --> 00:23:54,943
Blunt the knives, bend the forks
trash* the bottles and burn the corks

207
00:23:54,906 --> 00:24:00,212
crash* the glasses, and crack the plates,
that's what Bilbo Baggins hates!

208
00:24:00,168 --> 00:24:03,935
cut the cloth, trim the fat
pour the milk over the kitchen floor*

209
00:24:03,914 --> 00:24:07,633
bones we throw on the toilet floor*

210
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:11,676
smash the wine on every door
throw the jars in a boiling bowl*

211
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,434
dip them down with a big stick*

212
00:24:13,409 --> 00:24:17,953
when you're finished there will be a hole

213
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,884
let them roll in the hall*

214
00:24:28,407 --> 00:24:31,187
that's what Bilbo Baggins hates!

215
00:24:44,144 --> 00:24:46,831
He's here.

216
00:24:49,063 --> 00:24:55,205
Gandalf, I thought you said this place would be easy to find.

217
00:24:55,742 --> 00:25:01,438
I lost my way, twice. Wouldn't have found it at all
had it not been for that mark on the door.

218
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:04,340
Mark? There's no mark on that door.
It was painted a week ago.

219
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:07,162
There is a mark.
I put it there myself.

220
00:25:08,232 --> 00:25:12,099
Bilbo Baggins, allow me to introduce the leader of our company...

221
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:15,839
Thorin Oakenshield.

222
00:25:15,817 --> 00:25:19,544
So, this is the Hobbit.

223
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:24,972
Tell me Mr. Baggins, have you done much fighting?
- Pardon me?
Axe or sword?

224
00:25:24,949 --> 00:25:27,192
What's your weapon of choice?

225
00:25:27,194 --> 00:25:30,909
Well, I have some skills and conquers*.
If you must know.

226
00:25:30,888 --> 00:25:34,545
But I fail to see why that's relevant.

227
00:25:34,525 --> 00:25:38,866
Thought as much. He looks more
like a grocer than a burglar.

228
00:25:44,135 --> 00:25:48,020
What news from the meeting at Ered Luin?
Do they all come?

229
00:25:47,997 --> 00:25:51,324
Aye, envoyers* from all seven kingdoms.

230
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:55,884
What do the dwarves from the Iron Hills say?
Is Dain with us?

231
00:25:57,687 --> 00:26:00,872
They will not come.

232
00:26:03,736 --> 00:26:07,653
They say this quest is ours, and ours alone.

233
00:26:09,783 --> 00:26:12,890
You're going on a quest?

234
00:26:12,878 --> 00:26:17,601
Bilbo, my dear friend,
let us have a little more light.

235
00:26:17,566 --> 00:26:23,252
Far to the east,
over ranges and rivers ...

236
00:26:23,202 --> 00:26:27,311
beyond woodlands and wastelands...

237
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:30,548
lies a single solitary peak.

238
00:26:32,612 --> 00:26:35,947
The Lonely Mountain.

239
00:26:35,932 --> 00:26:42,714
Oin has read the portense*,
and the portense* say it is time.

240
00:26:42,648 --> 00:26:47,072
Ravens have been seen flying back to the mountain,
as it was foretold.

241
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:51,440
When the birds of yor
return to Erebor...

242
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:55,108
the reign of the beast will end.

243
00:26:56,351 --> 00:27:02,153
What beast?
- That would be a reference to Smaug the Terrible.

244
00:27:02,102 --> 00:27:05,762
Chiefest* and greatest calamity of our age.

245
00:27:05,742 --> 00:27:10,963
Airborne fire breather. Teeth like razors
and claws like meat hooks.

246
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,085
Extremely fond of precious metal.
-Yes, I know what a dragon is.

247
00:27:14,073 --> 00:27:19,822
I'm not afraid. I'm up for it.
I'll give him a taste of dwarven iron right up it's jack's end.*

248
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:24,007
Sit down.
- The task would be difficult enough with an army behind us.

249
00:27:23,979 --> 00:27:28,181
But we number just thirteen.
And not thirteen of the best...

250
00:27:28,153 --> 00:27:34,332
...nor brightest.
- What did you say?

251
00:27:34,275 --> 00:27:39,960
We may be few in numbers,
but we're fighters.

252
00:27:40,586 --> 00:27:47,797
All of us, to the last one!
- And you forget we have a wizard in our company. Gandalf would've killed hundreds of dragons in his time!

253
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:50,255
No, I wouldn't say.
- How many then?

254
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:52,585
How many dragons have you killed?

255
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:57,830
Go on! Give us a number.

256
00:28:01,648 --> 00:28:04,391
Order!*

257
00:28:05,175 --> 00:28:09,865
If we have read these signs,
do you not think others will have read them too?

258
00:28:11,534 --> 00:28:17,738
Rumors have begun to spread.
The dragon Smaug has not been seen for 60 years.

259
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:25,220
Eyes look east to the mountain assessing.
Wondering, weighing the risk.

260
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:29,211
Perhaps the vast wealth of our people
now lies unprotected.

261
00:28:29,186 --> 00:28:33,197
Do we sit back while others
claim what is rightfully ours?

262
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:36,719
Or do we seize this chance to take back Erebor?

263
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:41,275
You forget the front gate is sealed.

264
00:28:41,271 --> 00:28:47,277
There is no way into the mountain.
- That, my dear Balin, is not entirely true.

265
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:56,310
How came you by this?
-It was given to me by your father.

266
00:28:56,275 --> 00:29:00,928
By Thráin, for safekeeping.

267
00:29:00,893 --> 00:29:03,771
It is yours now.

268
00:29:09,735 --> 00:29:14,114
If there is a key, there must be a door.

269
00:29:14,084 --> 00:29:19,098
These runes speak of a hidden passage
to the lower halls.

270
00:29:19,058 --> 00:29:24,595
There's another way in.
-Well, if we can find it, but dwarf doors are invisible once closed.

271
00:29:27,952 --> 00:29:33,289
The answer lies hidden somewhere in this map
and I do not have the skill to find it, but...

272
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:37,204
There are others in Middle-earth
who can.

273
00:29:37,825 --> 00:29:43,954
The task I have in mind, will require a great deal of stealth
and no small amount of courage.

274
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:49,436
But if we are careful and clever,
it believe that it can be done.

275
00:29:49,616 --> 00:29:53,072
That's why we needed a burglar.
- And a good one too!

276
00:29:53,187 --> 00:29:57,857
An expert, I'd imagine.
- And are you?

277
00:29:59,637 --> 00:30:04,181
Am I what?
- He said he's an expert.

278
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:09,447
Me? No, I'm not a burglar.
I've never stolen a thing in my life.

279
00:30:09,533 --> 00:30:14,496
I'm afraid I'll have to agree with Mr. Baggins.
He is hardly burglar material.

280
00:30:15,736 --> 00:30:19,908
Aye, the wild is no place for gentle folk
who can neither fight nor fend for themselves.

281
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:24,822
It's fine.
- I can fight.

282
00:30:27,276 --> 00:30:33,821
Enough! If I say Bilbo Baggins is
a burglar, then a burglar he is.

283
00:30:34,851 --> 00:30:40,521
Hobbits are remarkably light on their feet.
In fact, they can pass unseen by most, if they choose.

284
00:30:40,602 --> 00:30:44,396
And while the dragon is accustomed
to the smell of dwarves...

285
00:30:44,506 --> 00:30:50,799
...the scent of a hobbit is all but unknown to him,
which gives us a distinct advantage.

286
00:30:50,868 --> 00:30:53,576
You asked me to find the 14th member of this company.

287
00:30:53,703 --> 00:30:58,416
And I've chosen Mr. Baggins.
There's a lot more to him than appearances suggest.

288
00:30:58,508 --> 00:31:02,759
And he's got a great deal more to offer
than any of you know.

289
00:31:02,864 --> 00:31:06,198
Including himself.

290
00:31:09,803 --> 00:31:14,143
You must trust me on this.

291
00:31:15,183 --> 00:31:20,642
Very well, we'll do it your way.
Give him our contract.

292
00:31:21,263 --> 00:31:24,429
It's just the usual.
Summary of our pocketed expenses.

293
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:28,217
Time required. Remuneration.
Funeral Arrangements so forth.

294
00:31:29,149 --> 00:31:32,107
Funeral Arrangements?

295
00:31:36,913 --> 00:31:39,902
I cannot guarantee his safety.
-Understood.

296
00:31:40,795 --> 00:31:43,292
Nor will I be responsible for his fate.

297
00:31:45,235 --> 00:31:48,534
Agreed.

298
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:53,426
Payment at delivery.*
Payment no later than the fourteenth.*

299
00:31:55,482 --> 00:32:00,037
No liability for injuries...*

300
00:32:00,004 --> 00:32:04,525
inflicted, but not  limited to lacerations...*

301
00:32:04,493 --> 00:32:09,536
Evisceration?

302
00:32:09,496 --> 00:32:13,802
Incineration?
-Oh aye, he'll melt the flesh off your bones
in the blink of an eye.

303
00:32:19,273 --> 00:32:21,507
You alright laddy?

304
00:32:23,072 --> 00:32:27,483
I'm feeling a bit faint.
-Think furnace with wings.

305
00:32:27,452 --> 00:32:33,222
I need air.
- A flash of light. Searing pain and "Poof!"you're nothing more than a pile of ash.

306
00:32:38,429 --> 00:32:44,256
Nope!
- You were very helpful, Bofur.

307
00:32:44,204 --> 00:32:49,826
I'll be alright, just...let me sit quietly for a moment.
-You've been sitting quietly for far too long.

308
00:32:50,946 --> 00:32:56,179
Tell me, when did doilys and your mother's
dishes become so important to you?

309
00:32:56,136 --> 00:33:01,334
I remember a young hobbit,
who was always running off in search of elves in the woods.

310
00:33:01,292 --> 00:33:08,551
Who'd stay out late, came home after dark,
threading mud and twigs and fireflies.

311
00:33:08,478 --> 00:33:14,305
A young hobbit would love nothing more than
to find out what was beyond the borders of the Shire.

312
00:33:14,253 --> 00:33:20,814
The world is not in your books and maps.

313
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:23,396
It's out there.

314
00:33:23,392 --> 00:33:26,215
I can't just go running off into the blue.

315
00:33:26,207 --> 00:33:29,436
I am a Baggins of Bag End.

316
00:33:29,423 --> 00:33:32,147
You're also a Took.

317
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:38,356
Did you know that your great-great-great-great-uncle Bullora Took was so large...

318
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,621
he could ride a real horse?

319
00:33:42,002 --> 00:33:46,920
At the Battle of Greenfields he charged the goblin ranks, he swang his club so hard...

320
00:33:46,882 --> 00:33:51,317
it knocked the Goblin King's head clean off
and it sailed 100 yards through the air...

321
00:33:51,286 --> 00:33:53,604
and went down a rabbit hole.

322
00:33:53,604 --> 00:33:58,320
And thus the battle was won,
and the game of golf invented at the same time.

323
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:07,910
I do believe you made that up.
-Well all good stories deserve embellishment.

324
00:34:09,101 --> 00:34:13,486
You'll have a tale or two to tell of your own when you come back.

325
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,966
Can you promise me that I will come back?

326
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:27,007
No... and if you do,
you will not be the same.

327
00:34:29,225 --> 00:34:31,837
That's what i thought.

328
00:34:31,805 --> 00:34:35,882
Sorry, Gandalf.
I can't sign this.

329
00:34:35,872 --> 00:34:39,502
You've got the wrong hobbit.

330
00:34:45,495 --> 00:34:50,278
It appears we have lost our burglar.

331
00:34:50,356 --> 00:34:54,469
Probably for the best.
The odds were always against us.

332
00:34:54,557 --> 00:34:57,517
After all, what are we?

333
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:04,011
Merchants, miners,
tinkers and toy makers.

334
00:35:03,966 --> 00:35:10,637
Not really the stuff of legend.
-There are a few warriors amongst us.

335
00:35:10,573 --> 00:35:12,570
Old warriors.

336
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:17,156
I would take each and every one of these old dwarves over an army from the Iron Hills.

337
00:35:18,127 --> 00:35:21,230
For when I called upon them, they answered.

338
00:35:21,332 --> 00:35:25,976
Loyalty, honor
and a willing heart.

339
00:35:26,977 --> 00:35:29,445
I can ask no more than that.

340
00:35:29,558 --> 00:35:34,593
You don't have to do this.
You have a choice.

341
00:35:34,552 --> 00:35:37,401
You have done honorably by our people.

342
00:35:38,633 --> 00:35:42,078
You have built a new life for us
in the Blue Mountains.

343
00:35:42,172 --> 00:35:46,060
A life of peace and plenty.

344
00:35:47,284 --> 00:35:52,189
A life that is worth more
than all the gold in Erebor.

345
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:57,241
From my grandfather to my father,
this has come to me.

346
00:35:58,981 --> 00:36:02,964
They dreamt of the day the dwarves of Erebor would reclaim their homeland.

347
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,005
There is no choice, Balin.

348
00:36:08,105 --> 00:36:11,586
Not for me.

349
00:36:11,681 --> 00:36:14,339
Then we are with you, laddy.

350
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:20,560
We will see it done.

351
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:47,861
Far over the misty mountains cold

352
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:52,359
to dungeons deep

353
00:36:52,565 --> 00:36:56,642
and caverns old

354
00:36:58,699 --> 00:37:05,859
we must awake, at break of day

355
00:37:05,788 --> 00:37:15,722
to find our long forgotten gold

356
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:20,254
the pines were roaring

357
00:37:20,336 --> 00:37:24,494
on the height

358
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:28,137
the winds were mourning

359
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:32,493
in the night

360
00:37:34,092 --> 00:37:38,243
the fire was red

361
00:37:38,331 --> 00:37:42,112
in flamming spread

362
00:37:42,237 --> 00:37:46,819
the trees like torches

363
00:37:46,786 --> 00:37:51,333
ablazed with light

364
00:38:29,478 --> 00:38:31,640
Hello?

365
00:39:56,347 --> 00:39:59,893
Mr. Bilbo, where are you off to?
-Can't stop, I'm already late.

366
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:04,738
Late for what?
-I'm going on an adventure.

367
00:40:11,261 --> 00:40:18,327
I told you,
Do not waste time with the hobbit.

368
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:20,970
Whose idea was it anyway?
-Wait.

369
00:40:21,132 --> 00:40:25,504
Wait.
-Woah, woah! Stop.

370
00:40:33,036 --> 00:40:36,437
I've signed it.

371
00:40:46,835 --> 00:40:49,563
Everything appears to be in order.

372
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:57,139
Welcome, Master Baggins,
to the company of Thorin Oakenshield.

373
00:41:01,434 --> 00:41:04,993
Give him a pony.
-No... no, no, that won't be necessary.

374
00:41:04,974 --> 00:41:09,574
I'm sure I can keep up on foot,
I've done my fair share of walking holidays, you know?

375
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:12,771
Even gone as far as Formorgen once.

376
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:32,179
Come on, Nori. Pay up!
-Hey! Thanks, lad.

377
00:41:32,304 --> 00:41:34,066
What's that about?

378
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:38,505
Oh! They took wagers of wether or not you'd turn up.

379
00:41:38,479 --> 00:41:41,196
Most of them bet that you wouldn't.

380
00:41:42,434 --> 00:41:44,856
And what did you think?

381
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:53,467
My dear fella, I never doubted you for a second.

382
00:41:58,211 --> 00:42:01,889
Oh, horsehair... having a reaction.

383
00:42:03,895 --> 00:42:06,491
Wait, wait. Stop.

384
00:42:06,612 --> 00:42:10,255
We have to turn around.
- What on earth is the matter?

385
00:42:10,363 --> 00:42:15,216
I've forgotten my handkerchief.
- Here, use this!

386
00:42:19,509 --> 00:42:21,460
Move on.

387
00:42:28,161 --> 00:42:31,006
You'll have to manage without pocket handkerchiefs...

388
00:42:31,126 --> 00:42:36,395
and a good many other things, Bilbo Baggins,
before we reach our journey's end.

389
00:42:37,595 --> 00:42:42,988
You were born to the rolling hills
and little rivers of the Shire.

390
00:42:43,303 --> 00:42:46,929
But home is now behind you.

391
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:50,291
The world is ahead.

392
00:43:29,344 --> 00:43:33,476
Hello girl. Who's a good girl?

393
00:43:36,712 --> 00:43:41,184
It's our little secret, Myrtel.
You'll tell no one.

394
00:43:45,815 --> 00:43:49,075
What was that?
-Orcs.

395
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:55,373
Orcs?
-Throat-Cutters. There will be dozens of them out there.

396
00:43:55,399 --> 00:44:00,765
The lowlands are crawiling with them.
-They strike in the wee small hours when everyone is asleep.

397
00:44:00,853 --> 00:44:03,904
Quick and quiet. No screams,
just lots of blood.

398
00:44:08,349 --> 00:44:11,544
You think that's funny?

399
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:14,027
You think a night raid by orcs
is a joke?

400
00:44:14,871 --> 00:44:17,407
We didn't mean anything by it.

401
00:44:17,448 --> 00:44:22,213
No, you didn't.
You know nothing of the world.

402
00:44:23,254 --> 00:44:25,598
Don't mind him, laddy.

403
00:44:25,724 --> 00:44:30,411
Thorin has more cause than most
to hate Orcs.

404
00:44:34,955 --> 00:44:37,921
After the dragon took the Lonely Mountain...

405
00:44:38,458 --> 00:44:43,557
King Thrór tried to reclaim
the ancient dwarven kingdom of Moria.

406
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:48,888
But our enemy had gotten there first.

407
00:45:01,158 --> 00:45:05,858
Moriah had been taken by legions of Orcs...

408
00:45:05,823 --> 00:45:10,490
led by the most vile of all there is.

409
00:45:10,588 --> 00:45:13,725
Azog the Defiler.

410
00:45:15,782 --> 00:45:20,800
The giant Gundabad Orc
had sworn...

411
00:45:20,888 --> 00:45:24,428
to wipe out the line of Durin.

412
00:45:28,095 --> 00:45:32,866
He began by beheading the king.

413
00:45:47,823 --> 00:45:52,712
Thráin, Thorin's father was driven mad by grief.

414
00:45:52,807 --> 00:45:58,034
He went missing, taken prisoner or killed.
We did not know.

415
00:45:58,739 --> 00:46:00,327
We were leaderless.

416
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:06,199
Defeat and death were upon us.

417
00:46:09,162 --> 00:46:13,511
That is when I saw him.

418
00:46:15,507 --> 00:46:21,235
A young dwarf prince
facing down The Pale Orc.

419
00:46:25,891 --> 00:46:30,744
He stood alone
against this terrible foe.

420
00:46:39,029 --> 00:46:44,342
His armor ranked,
wielding nothing but an Oaken branch as a shield.

421
00:46:56,968 --> 00:47:02,346
Azog the Defiler learned that day...

422
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:06,734
that the line of Durin
would not be so easily broken.

423
00:47:34,353 --> 00:47:39,540
Our forces rallied
and drove the Orcs back.

424
00:47:41,173 --> 00:47:45,397
Our enemy had been defeated.

425
00:47:46,522 --> 00:47:52,209
But there was no feast.
No song that night.

426
00:47:52,586 --> 00:47:57,775
For our dead were beyond the count of grief.

427
00:47:58,644 --> 00:48:01,865
We few had survived.

428
00:48:08,531 --> 00:48:12,129
And I thought to myself then...

429
00:48:14,633 --> 00:48:18,770
there is one who I could follow.

430
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:25,744
There is one I could call King.

431
00:48:44,012 --> 00:48:46,789
And the pale Orc?

432
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:53,468
What happened to him?
-He crawled* back into the hole whence he came.

433
00:48:53,452 --> 00:48:56,854
That filth died of his wounds long ago.

434
00:49:41,627 --> 00:49:46,386
Mr. Gandalf, you can do something about
this deluge?

435
00:49:46,537 --> 00:49:52,813
It is raining, master dwarf.
And it will continue to rain until the rain is done.

436
00:49:53,585 --> 00:49:57,472
If you wish to change the weather of the world,
you should find yourself another wizard.

437
00:49:58,902 --> 00:50:03,126
Are there any? Other wizards.
-There are five of us.

438
00:50:03,226 --> 00:50:07,745
The greatest of our Order
is Saruman the White.

439
00:50:07,845 --> 00:50:10,601
Then there are the two blue wizards.

440
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:15,354
You know I've quite forgotten their names.

441
00:50:15,466 --> 00:50:20,446
And who is the fifth?
-Well that would be Radagast the Brown.

442
00:50:20,534 --> 00:50:24,255
Is he a great wizard
or is he... more like you?

443
00:50:26,261 --> 00:50:30,986
I think he's a very great wizard.
In his own way.

444
00:50:31,082 --> 00:50:35,726
He is a gentle soul, who prefers the company
of animals to others.

445
00:50:35,821 --> 00:50:40,216
He keeps a watchful eye over the
vast forest lands to the east.

446
00:50:40,273 --> 00:50:46,462
And they are a good thing too,
for always evil will look to find a foothold in this world.

447
00:50:52,575 --> 00:50:56,398
Not good.
Not good at all!

448
00:51:20,363 --> 00:51:22,832
No, Sebastian.

449
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:28,426
Good gracious.

450
00:51:48,624 --> 00:51:51,804
Move back!
Give him some air. For goodness sake!

451
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:07,214
I don't understand why it's not working!

452
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:09,627
It's not if it's witchcraft.

453
00:52:12,308 --> 00:52:15,220
Witchcraft...

454
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:19,915
Oh! But it is.

455
00:52:20,718 --> 00:52:26,615
A dark and powerful magic.

456
00:53:57,096 --> 00:54:02,022
Where on this good earth
did those vile creatures come from?

457
00:54:03,355 --> 00:54:08,156
The Old Fortress?
Show me.

458
00:54:40,312 --> 00:54:44,614
We camp here for the night.
Fili, Kili. Look after the ponies.

459
00:54:44,551 --> 00:54:47,081
Make sure you stay with them.

460
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:51,073
A farmer and his family used to live here.

461
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:54,495
Oin, Gloin. Get a fire going.

462
00:54:55,157 --> 00:54:58,013
I think it would be wiser to move on.

463
00:54:59,598 --> 00:55:02,939
We could make to the Hidden Valley.

464
00:55:03,051 --> 00:55:06,819
I have told you already,
I will not go near that place.

465
00:55:06,797 --> 00:55:11,298
Why not? The Elves could help us.
We could get food, rest... advice.

466
00:55:11,398 --> 00:55:13,399
I do not need their advice.

467
00:55:13,538 --> 00:55:17,464
We have a map that we can not read.
Lord Elrond could help us.

468
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,061
Help?

469
00:55:20,187 --> 00:55:24,733
Dragon attacks Erebor,
what help came from the Elves?

470
00:55:25,529 --> 00:55:30,113
Orcs plunder Moria
and desecrate our sacred halls.

471
00:55:30,212 --> 00:55:34,005
The Elves looked on and did nothing.

472
00:55:34,112 --> 00:55:39,365
You ask me to seek out the very people who betrayed my grandfather.
Who betrayed my father.

473
00:55:39,525 --> 00:55:41,606
You are neither of them.

474
00:55:41,576 --> 00:55:45,604
I did not give you that mountain key
for you to hold on to the past.

475
00:55:45,646 --> 00:55:49,066
I did not know that it was yours to keep.

476
00:55:53,106 --> 00:55:56,457
Everything all right?
Gandalf, where are you going?

477
00:55:56,573 --> 00:56:00,110
To seek the company of the only one
around here who has got any sense.

478
00:56:00,093 --> 00:56:02,858
And who is that?
- Myself, Mr. Baggins.

479
00:56:02,983 --> 00:56:07,483
I've had enough of dwarves for one day.

480
00:56:07,584 --> 00:56:13,125
Come on, Bombur. We are hungry.
-Is he coming back?

481
00:56:15,503 --> 00:56:16,803
He's been a long time.

482
00:56:17,018 --> 00:56:18,718
Who?
-Gandalf.

483
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,635
He's a wizard, he does what he chooses.

484
00:56:21,713 --> 00:56:27,091
Here, do us a favor, take this to the lads.
Stop it! You've had plenty.

485
00:56:45,454 --> 00:56:48,663
What's the matter?
-We're supposed to be looking after the ponies.

486
00:56:48,782 --> 00:56:53,034
Only we've encountered a... slight problem.
-We had 16.

487
00:56:53,139 --> 00:56:58,810
Now there's... 14.

488
00:56:59,627 --> 00:57:04,088
Daisy and Bungo are missing.
-Well, that's not good.

489
00:57:04,185 --> 00:57:07,604
And that is not good at all.
-Shouldn't we tell Thorin?

490
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:13,725
No, there's no worry.
-As our official burglar, we thought you might like looking into it.

491
00:57:13,671 --> 00:57:18,762
Something big uprooted these trees.

492
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:23,856
That was our thinking.
-And something very big and possibly quite dangerous.

493
00:57:24,847 --> 00:57:28,432
Hey, there is a light.

494
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:31,756
Over here.

495
00:57:32,244 --> 00:57:34,867
Stay down!

496
00:57:38,689 --> 00:57:43,527
What is it?
-Trolls.

497
00:58:08,264 --> 00:58:11,185
He's got Myrtel and Mindy!*

498
00:58:11,304 --> 00:58:16,018
I think they're gonna eat them, we have to do something.
- Yes, you should.

499
00:58:16,111 --> 00:58:20,238
Mountain trolls are slow and stupid,
and you are so small they will never see you.

500
00:58:20,339 --> 00:58:22,342
It's perfectly safe.
We'll be right behind you.

501
00:58:22,478 --> 00:58:26,304
If you run into trouble, hoot twice
like a barn owl. Twice like a barn owl!

502
00:58:26,281 --> 00:58:31,216
Twice like a barn owl, Twice like a...?
Are you sure this is a good idea?

503
00:58:31,722 --> 00:58:36,138
Mutton yesterday.
Mutton today.

504
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:41,283
And blimey, if it don't look like mutton again tomorrow.
-Quit your whining*.

505
00:58:41,375 --> 00:58:46,255
These ain't sheep.
These is fresh nice!

506
00:58:46,343 --> 00:58:51,262
I don't like horse. I never have.
Not enough fat on them.

507
00:58:51,357 --> 00:58:53,799
Well it's better than the old farmer.*

508
00:58:53,798 --> 00:58:59,155
All skin and bones he was. I'm still picking bits of him off me teeth.*

509
00:58:59,243 --> 00:59:04,535
That's lovely that is. A floater.
-Might improve the flavor!

510
00:59:04,622 --> 00:59:10,252
Oh! There's more where that came from.
-Oh, no you don't!

511
00:59:12,264 --> 00:59:15,810
Sit down.

512
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:28,718
I hope you're gonna dunk these in eggs.*
-But I like the stinky parts.*

513
00:59:30,428 --> 00:59:32,892
I said sit down!

514
00:59:33,021 --> 00:59:36,939
I'm starving.
Are we having horse tonight or not?

515
00:59:37,043 --> 00:59:41,075
Shut your cake hole.
You'll eat what I give you.

516
00:59:41,809 --> 00:59:45,393
How come he's the cook?
Everything tastes the same.

517
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:50,086
Everything tastes like chicken.
-Except the chicken. That tastes like fish!*

518
00:59:50,056 --> 00:59:55,610
I'm just sayin',
a little appreciation would be nice.

519
00:59:56,552 --> 01:00:01,623
"Thank you very much, Bert. What a lovely stew, Bert"
How hard is that?

520
01:00:03,783 --> 01:00:08,199
Just needs a sprinkle of squirrel dung.

521
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,382
That's my grog.

522
01:00:11,958 --> 01:00:14,876
Sorry.

523
01:00:17,790 --> 01:00:21,480
Oh, that is beautifuly balanced that is.

524
01:00:22,245 --> 01:00:27,649
... be along, eh?*
Put it there.*

525
01:00:29,929 --> 01:00:33,086
That's why I'm the cook.

526
01:00:40,213 --> 01:00:44,452
Oh me gafs* are rumbling.
I've got to snaffle something!

527
01:00:44,554 --> 01:00:47,339
Flesh. I need flesh!

528
01:00:50,779 --> 01:00:54,469
Bugger me!*
Look what's come out of me outter!*

529
01:00:54,557 --> 01:00:58,383
It's got arms and legs and everything.
- What is it?

530
01:00:58,487 --> 01:01:01,733
I don't know, but I don't like the way it feels real.*

531
01:01:04,877 --> 01:01:08,286
What are you then?
An oversized squirrel?

532
01:01:08,397 --> 01:01:12,304
I'm a burglar... A Hobbit!
- A burglar Hobbit?

533
01:01:12,411 --> 01:01:17,522
Can we cook him?
- We can try.

534
01:01:19,374 --> 01:01:24,360
Ain't be more than a mouthful,
not when it's skinned and boned!

535
01:01:24,452 --> 01:01:30,230
Perhaps, there's more burglar Hobbits around these parts.
Maybe enough for a pie!

536
01:01:31,043 --> 01:01:33,867
Get him!
-He's too quick!

537
01:01:34,768 --> 01:01:37,841
Gotcha!

538
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:43,449
Are there any more of you little fellas
hidding in this wilderness?
-No...

539
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:46,398
He's lying.
-No, I'm not!

540
01:01:46,517 --> 01:01:51,713
Hold his toes over the fire,
make him squeal!

541
01:01:55,444 --> 01:01:58,064
Drop him!
-You want it?

542
01:01:58,188 --> 01:02:02,594
I said, drop him.

543
01:02:24,843 --> 01:02:28,461
Hit them in the face!*

544
01:03:18,486 --> 01:03:21,270
Bilbo.
-No.

545
01:03:21,393 --> 01:03:26,359
Lay down your arms,
or we'll rip his off!

546
01:03:42,069 --> 01:03:44,105
Do we bother cookin' them?

547
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:48,395
Let's just sit on them
and squash them into jelly!

548
01:03:48,495 --> 01:03:53,153
They should be salted and grilled
with a sprig of sage.

549
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:56,322
That does sound quite nice.

550
01:03:59,470 --> 01:04:03,459
Nevermind the seasoning.
We ain't got all night.

551
01:04:03,567 --> 01:04:09,793
Dawn ain't far away, let's get a move on.
I don't fancy being turned to stone.

552
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,491
Wait, you are making a terrible mistake.

553
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:20,989
You cannot reason with them. They are halfwits!
-Halfwits? What does that make us?

554
01:04:21,089 --> 01:04:24,333
I meant with the uh... with the seasoning.

555
01:04:24,448 --> 01:04:28,901
What about the seasoning?
- Have you smelled them?

556
01:04:28,869 --> 01:04:32,868
You're gonna need something stronger than seasoning
before you plate this lot up.

557
01:04:32,810 --> 01:04:36,729
Traitor.
-What do you know about cooking dwarfs?

558
01:04:36,707 --> 01:04:41,621
Shut up.
Let the burglar Hobbit talk.*

559
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:46,493
The secret to cooking dwarf is uhm...

560
01:04:46,584 --> 01:04:50,996
Yes? Come on, tell us the secret.
-Yes. The secret is...

561
01:04:53,135 --> 01:04:57,250
To skin them first!
-What?

562
01:04:57,354 --> 01:05:01,549
Tom, give me my fillet knife.
- I'll get you!

563
01:05:01,652 --> 01:05:05,974
Not gonna forget that, I won't forget!.
-What a load of rubbish!

564
01:05:06,076 --> 01:05:11,475
I've eaten plenty with their skins on.
With skin, with boots and all!*

565
01:05:12,339 --> 01:05:17,118
He's right.
Nothin' wrong with a pair of raw dwarves.

566
01:05:19,546 --> 01:05:25,004
Nice and crunchy.
-Not that one. He's infected.

567
01:05:25,648 --> 01:05:30,842
Huh?
-He's got worms in his...tubes.

568
01:05:33,099 --> 01:05:37,465
In fact, they all have.
They are infested with parasites.

569
01:05:37,562 --> 01:05:42,301
It's a terrible business, I wouldn't risk it. I really wouldn't
-Did he say parasites?

570
01:05:42,393 --> 01:05:46,010
We do not have parasites! You have parasites!

571
01:05:50,215 --> 01:05:55,034
I've got parasites as big as my arm!
-I've got the biggest parasites!

572
01:05:56,971 --> 01:05:59,840
We are riddled.

573
01:05:59,958 --> 01:06:02,911
What would you have us do then?

574
01:06:03,029 --> 01:06:08,185
Let'em all go? -Well...
You think I don't know what you're up to?

575
01:06:08,269 --> 01:06:12,676
This little ferret is taking us for fools.

576
01:06:12,777 --> 01:06:14,677
Ferret?
-Fools?

577
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:18,188
The dawn will take you all!

578
01:06:19,037 --> 01:06:22,553
Who's that? -No idea.
-Can we eat him too?

579
01:06:47,928 --> 01:06:50,552
Oh, get your foot outta my back!

580
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:04,006
Where did you go to if I may ask?
-To look ahead.

581
01:07:04,106 --> 01:07:07,888
What brought you back?
-Looking behind.

582
01:07:07,998 --> 01:07:12,807
Nasty business. Still the're all in one piece.
-No thanks to your burglar.

583
01:07:13,644 --> 01:07:19,363
He had the nack to play for time.
None of the rest of you thought of that.

584
01:07:22,015 --> 01:07:24,785
They must have come down from the Ettenwoods*.

585
01:07:24,778 --> 01:07:27,265
Since when did mountain trolls
venture this far south?

586
01:07:27,229 --> 01:07:30,119
Oh, not for an age.

587
01:07:30,725 --> 01:07:34,591
Not since a darker power ruled these lands.

588
01:07:39,002 --> 01:07:43,486
They could not have moved in daylight.

589
01:07:43,454 --> 01:07:47,903
There must be a cave nearby.

590
01:07:56,899 --> 01:08:02,074
Oh,What's that stench?
-It's a Trollhole.

591
01:08:02,032 --> 01:08:07,172
Be careful what you touch.

592
01:08:17,418 --> 01:08:20,494
Seems a shame just to leave it lying around.

593
01:08:20,951 --> 01:08:26,301
Anyone can take it.
- Agreed. Nori!

594
01:08:26,257 --> 01:08:28,894
Get a shovel.

595
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:47,367
These swords are not made by any troll.

596
01:08:52,196 --> 01:08:56,642
Nor were they made by any smith among men.

597
01:09:01,078 --> 01:09:06,730
These were forged in Gondor*,
by the high elves of the first age.

598
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:11,673
You could not wish for a finner blade.

599
01:09:35,350 --> 01:09:41,388
We're making a long term deposit.
-Let's get out of this foul place.

600
01:09:41,399 --> 01:09:44,969
Come on, let's go.

601
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:11,136
Here. This is about your size.

602
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:21,257
I can't take this.
-The blade is of elvish make...

603
01:10:21,222 --> 01:10:26,399
which means it will glow blue when Orcs or Goblins are nearby.

604
01:10:27,255 --> 01:10:31,577
I've never used a sword in my life.
-And I hope you never have to.

605
01:10:31,548 --> 01:10:35,129
But if you do, remember this:

606
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:39,897
True courage is about knowing
not when to take a life...

607
01:10:40,559 --> 01:10:44,315
but when to spare one.

608
01:10:47,973 --> 01:10:52,536
Something 's coming!
-Stay together.

609
01:10:52,503 --> 01:10:57,015
Hurry now!
Arm yourselves.

610
01:11:13,419 --> 01:11:18,266
Thieves. Fire.
Murder.

611
01:11:18,355 --> 01:11:20,799
Radagast.

612
01:11:21,301 --> 01:11:24,786
Radagast the Brown.

613
01:11:27,377 --> 01:11:32,366
What on earth are you doing here?
-I was looking for you, Gandalf. Something is wrong.

614
01:11:32,459 --> 01:11:35,941
Something is terribly wrong.
-Yes?

615
01:11:40,454 --> 01:11:46,518
Just give me a minute.
I had a thought, now I lost it.

616
01:11:46,592 --> 01:11:51,164
It was right there, on the tip of my tongue.

617
01:11:51,264 --> 01:11:56,168
Oh! It's not a thought at all.
It's just a little...

618
01:11:56,675 --> 01:11:59,777
stick insect.

619
01:12:01,886 --> 01:12:07,798
The Greenwood is sick, Gandalf.
A darkness has fallen over it.

620
01:12:08,395 --> 01:12:12,927
Nothing grows anymore,
at least nothing good.

621
01:12:13,024 --> 01:12:17,752
The air has fowl decay,
but the worst are the webs.

622
01:12:18,007 --> 01:12:21,685
Webs? What do you mean?
-Spiders, Gandalf.

623
01:12:21,666 --> 01:12:26,652
Giant ones.
Some kind of spawn of Ungoliant...

624
01:12:26,579 --> 01:12:28,923
or I'm not a Wizard.

625
01:12:28,923 --> 01:12:34,028
I followed their trail.
They came from Dol Guldur.

626
01:12:36,027 --> 01:12:42,195
Dol Guldur?
But the old fortress is abandoned.

627
01:12:42,157 --> 01:12:45,805
No, Gandalf.

628
01:12:45,914 --> 01:12:48,126
It is not.

629
01:12:55,501 --> 01:13:02,318
A dark power dwelves in there.
Such as I have never felt before.

630
01:13:03,529 --> 01:13:08,579
It is the shadow of an ancient horror.

631
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:19,038
One that can summon
the spirits of the dead.

632
01:13:35,362 --> 01:13:37,206
I saw him, Gandalf.

633
01:13:38,594 --> 01:13:44,058
From out of the darkness
a necromancer has come.

634
01:13:52,683 --> 01:13:55,307
Quick, quick.

635
01:13:57,275 --> 01:13:59,272
Wait for me.

636
01:14:11,972 --> 01:14:15,872
Sorry.
-try a little tube weed.*

637
01:14:15,911 --> 01:14:18,327
It helps loosen your nerves.

638
01:14:21,011 --> 01:14:23,386
And then blow.*

639
01:14:29,652 --> 01:14:34,139
Now. A necromancer?
Are you sure?

640
01:14:47,123 --> 01:14:52,594
That is not from the world of the living.

641
01:14:58,579 --> 01:15:04,383
Was that a wolf? Are there wolves out there?
-Wolves? No, that's not a wolf.

642
01:15:19,683 --> 01:15:22,875
Warg scouts. Which means
an Orc pack is not far behind.

643
01:15:22,889 --> 01:15:24,401
Orc pack?

644
01:15:24,431 --> 01:15:28,081
Who did you tell about your quest beyond your guild?
-No one.

645
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:31,056
Who did you tell?
- No one, I swear.

646
01:15:31,592 --> 01:15:35,457
What in Durin's name is going on?
- You're being hunted.

647
01:15:35,717 --> 01:15:37,427
We have to get out of here.

648
01:15:37,402 --> 01:15:40,995
We can't, we have no ponies.
They bolted.

649
01:15:41,297 --> 01:15:43,069
I'll drawn them off.

650
01:15:43,143 --> 01:15:46,191
They are Gundabad-Wargs.
They'll outrun you.

651
01:15:46,251 --> 01:15:51,699
These are Rhoskobel rabbits.
I'd like to see them try.

652
01:16:03,294 --> 01:16:05,623
Come and get me.

653
01:16:14,766 --> 01:16:16,285
Come on.

654
01:16:43,688 --> 01:16:45,412
Stay together.
-Move!

655
01:16:57,046 --> 01:16:59,498
Ori, no! Go back!

656
01:17:02,377 --> 01:17:04,751
Come on quickly. Come on!

657
01:17:06,478 --> 01:17:08,619
Where are you leading us?

658
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:19,102
Move.
-Run!

659
01:18:35,411 --> 01:18:38,039
There they are.

660
01:18:38,517 --> 01:18:41,323
This way.
Quickly!

661
01:18:52,071 --> 01:18:57,371
There's more coming!
-Kili, shoot them!

662
01:19:01,263 --> 01:19:03,775
We are surrounded!

663
01:19:06,978 --> 01:19:10,504
Where is Gandalf?
- He's abandoned us!

664
01:19:16,727 --> 01:19:19,699
Hold your ground!

665
01:19:25,604 --> 01:19:27,371
Ready!

666
01:19:27,886 --> 01:19:31,941
This way you fools.
- Come on, move.

667
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:36,932
Quickly, all of you!

668
01:19:37,614 --> 01:19:40,354
Go, go, go!

669
01:19:50,210 --> 01:19:51,881
Nine, ten ...

670
01:19:53,449 --> 01:19:55,446
Kili.

671
01:20:34,093 --> 01:20:36,021
Elves.

672
01:20:38,817 --> 01:20:42,556
I can not see where the path will lead.
Do we follow it or not?

673
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:44,185
Follow it, of course.

674
01:20:47,725 --> 01:20:49,889
I think that would be wise.

675
01:21:46,575 --> 01:21:49,762
The valley of Imladris.

676
01:21:50,434 --> 01:21:56,645
In the common tongue it is known by another name.
- Rivendell.

677
01:21:59,219 --> 01:22:03,447
Here lies the last holy house
east of the Sea.

678
01:22:05,207 --> 01:22:10,158
Was this your plan all along?
To seek refuge with our enemy.

679
01:22:10,606 --> 01:22:13,598
You have no enemies here,
Thorin Oakenshield.

680
01:22:13,775 --> 01:22:18,590
The only ill will to be found in this valley,
is that which you bring yourself.

681
01:22:18,585 --> 01:22:22,957
Do you think the elves
will give our quest their blessing?

682
01:22:23,268 --> 01:22:25,047
They will try to stop us.

683
01:22:25,165 --> 01:22:29,262
Of course they will, but we have
questions that need to be answered.

684
01:22:32,416 --> 01:22:36,891
If are to be successful, this will
need to be handled with tact and respect.

685
01:22:37,227 --> 01:22:40,363
And no small degree of charm.

686
01:22:40,882 --> 01:22:44,268
Which is why you will leave the talking to me.

687
01:23:40,290 --> 01:23:44,702
Mithrandir.
-Ah! Lindir.

688
01:23:45,375 --> 01:23:46,977
Be on your guard.

689
01:23:47,909 --> 01:23:52,486
- I must speak with to Lord Elrond.

690
01:23:52,574 --> 01:23:56,195
My Lord Elrond is not here.
-Not here?

691
01:23:57,435 --> 01:23:59,923
Where is he?

692
01:24:10,962 --> 01:24:14,121
Here they come! Close ranks.

693
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:40,822
Gandalf.
-Lord Elrond.

694
01:24:57,615 --> 01:25:01,402
Strange for orcs to come
so close to our borders.

695
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:05,254
Something, or someone has drawn them near.

696
01:25:05,744 --> 01:25:08,365
Ah, that may have been us.

697
01:25:12,895 --> 01:25:16,308
Welcome, Thorin, son of Thrain.

698
01:25:16,678 --> 01:25:22,159
I do not believe we have met.
-You have your grandfather's bearing.

699
01:25:22,476 --> 01:25:28,952
I knew Thror, when he ruled under the mountain.
-Indeed? He did no mention of you.

700
01:25:39,214 --> 01:25:43,762
What is he saying?
Does he offer us insult?

701
01:25:43,729 --> 01:25:48,243
No, master Gloin.
He's offering you food.

702
01:25:54,081 --> 01:25:58,324
Ah, well. In that case, lead on.

703
01:26:01,075 --> 01:26:05,778
Try it. Just a mouthful.
- I don't like green food.

704
01:26:06,453 --> 01:26:11,089
Where's the meat?
-Have they got any chips?

705
01:26:11,795 --> 01:26:13,779
Kind of you to invite us.

706
01:26:13,842 --> 01:26:17,321
I'm not really dressed for dinner.
-Ah, you never are.

707
01:26:37,521 --> 01:26:41,593
This is Okrist, the Goblin Cleaver.

708
01:26:41,729 --> 01:26:46,224
A famous blade, forged by the
high elves of the West.

709
01:26:46,735 --> 01:26:48,731
My kin.

710
01:26:49,582 --> 01:26:54,110
May it serve you well.
And this, is Glamdring.

711
01:26:55,016 --> 01:26:58,840
the Foe-Hammer.
Sword of the King of Gondolin.

712
01:27:01,648 --> 01:27:03,219
I wouldn't bother, laddy.

713
01:27:03,356 --> 01:27:06,880
Swords are named for the great deeds they do in war.

714
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:09,156
What are you saying?
My sword hasn't seen battle?

715
01:27:09,704 --> 01:27:15,420
Not actually sure it's a sword.
More of a letter opener really.

716
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:18,039
How did you come by these?

717
01:27:18,068 --> 01:27:21,323
We found them in a Troll hole,
on the great east road.

718
01:27:21,793 --> 01:27:24,876
Shortly before we were ambushed by orcs.

719
01:27:25,215 --> 01:27:28,797
And what were you doing on
the great east road?

720
01:27:30,338 --> 01:27:32,601
Our business is no concern of elves.

721
01:27:32,654 --> 01:27:37,908
For Goodness' sake, Thorin, show him the map.
-It is the legacy of my people.

722
01:27:37,865 --> 01:27:41,582
It is mine to protect,
as are it's secrets.

723
01:27:41,562 --> 01:27:47,349
Save me from the stubbornness of dwarves.
Your pride will be your downfall.

724
01:27:47,691 --> 01:27:51,750
You stand here in the presence of one of the
few in Middle-Earth who can read that map.

725
01:27:52,218 --> 01:27:54,648
Show it to Lord Elrond.

726
01:28:01,441 --> 01:28:03,909
Thorin, no.

727
01:28:12,436 --> 01:28:14,021
Erebor.

728
01:28:15,145 --> 01:28:18,802
What is your interest in this map?

729
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:22,202
It's mainly academic.

730
01:28:22,229 --> 01:28:26,374
As you know, this sort of artifact
sometimes contain hidden texts.

731
01:28:32,147 --> 01:28:35,318
You still read ancient dwarvish, do you not?

732
01:28:40,673 --> 01:28:42,630
Kirth Ithil.

733
01:28:43,017 --> 01:28:47,134
Moon Runes.
-Of course.

734
01:28:47,821 --> 01:28:49,816
An easy thing to miss.

735
01:28:49,976 --> 01:28:53,094
Well in this case that is true.
Moon runes can only be read...

736
01:28:53,082 --> 01:28:56,610
by the light of a moon of the
same shape and season...

737
01:28:56,592 --> 01:28:58,877
as the day on which they were written.

738
01:28:59,072 --> 01:29:01,780
Can you read them?

739
01:29:05,555 --> 01:29:08,831
These runes were written
on a midsummer's eve...

740
01:29:08,887 --> 01:29:13,671
by the light of a crescent moon,
nearly 200 years ago.

741
01:29:13,916 --> 01:29:17,539
It would seem you were meant
to come to Rivendell.

742
01:29:17,691 --> 01:29:22,399
Fate is with you, Thorin Oakenshield.
The same moon shines upon us tonight.

743
01:29:41,687 --> 01:29:46,316
"Stand by the gray stone,
when the thrush knocks...

744
01:29:46,392 --> 01:29:51,240
and the setting sun with the last
of Durin's day...

745
01:29:51,356 --> 01:29:55,840
will shine upon the keyhole.
-Durin's Day?

746
01:29:55,808 --> 01:29:58,012
It is the start of the dwarves'
new year.

747
01:29:58,057 --> 01:30:00,864
When the last moon of
autumn, and the first sun of winter...

748
01:30:00,849 --> 01:30:03,493
appear in the sky together.
That is ill news.

749
01:30:04,187 --> 01:30:07,398
The summer is passing.
Durin's Day will soon be upon us.

750
01:30:07,430 --> 01:30:09,386
We still have time.
-Time? For what?

751
01:30:09,409 --> 01:30:10,930
To find the entrance.

752
01:30:10,953 --> 01:30:14,698
We have to be standing at exactly the right spot,
at exactly the right time.

753
01:30:14,775 --> 01:30:19,142
Then, and only then,
can the door be opened.

754
01:30:19,225 --> 01:30:24,449
So this is your purpose, to enter the mountain?
-What of it?

755
01:30:24,769 --> 01:30:28,432
There are some who would not deem it wise.

756
01:30:29,384 --> 01:30:31,187
What do you mean?

757
01:30:31,930 --> 01:30:36,108
You're not the only guardian to stand
watch over Middle-earth.

758
01:32:36,495 --> 01:32:38,766
Bombur.

759
01:32:44,481 --> 01:32:48,779
With or without our help,
these dwarves will march to the mountain.

760
01:32:48,988 --> 01:32:51,613
They are determined
to reclaim their homeland.

761
01:32:52,018 --> 01:32:54,450
I do not believe that Thorin
Oakenshield feels...

762
01:32:54,415 --> 01:32:56,848
that he is answearable to anyone.

763
01:32:56,894 --> 01:33:01,910
Nor for that matter, am I.
-It is not me you must answer to.

764
01:33:13,610 --> 01:33:17,844
Lady Galadriel.
- Mithrandir.

765
01:33:36,630 --> 01:33:40,303
I had no idea Lord Elrond
had sent for you.

766
01:33:40,567 --> 01:33:44,169
He didn't.
I did.

767
01:33:52,325 --> 01:33:57,854
Saruman.
-You've been busy of late, my friend.

768
01:33:58,957 --> 01:34:00,977
Tell me, Gandalf...

769
01:34:01,296 --> 01:34:07,020
did you think these plans and
schemes of yours would go unnoticed?

770
01:34:06,970 --> 01:34:09,100
Unnoticed?

771
01:34:09,628 --> 01:34:13,782
No.
I'm simply doing what I feel to be right.

772
01:34:13,783 --> 01:34:17,414
The dragon has long been on your mind.

773
01:34:17,501 --> 01:34:22,412
That is true, My Lady.
Smaug owes allegiance to no one.

774
01:34:22,502 --> 01:34:28,322
But if he should side with the enemy,
a dragon could be used to terrible effect.

775
01:34:28,271 --> 01:34:33,040
What enemy?
Gandalf, the enemy is defeated.

776
01:34:33,312 --> 01:34:37,828
Sauron is vanquished.
He can never regain his full strength.

777
01:34:38,443 --> 01:34:43,901
Gandalf.
For 400 years we have lived in peace.

778
01:34:43,855 --> 01:34:46,957
A hard won, watchful peace.

779
01:34:47,079 --> 01:34:49,704
Are we? Are we at peace?

780
01:34:50,981 --> 01:34:56,200
Trolls have come down from the mountains.
They are raiding villages, destroying farms.

781
01:34:56,293 --> 01:35:00,688
Orcs have attacked us on the road.
-Hardly a prelude to war.

782
01:35:00,705 --> 01:35:05,105
Always you have meddled*.
Looking for trouble where none exist.

783
01:35:05,296 --> 01:35:07,326
Let him speak.

784
01:35:07,792 --> 01:35:13,376
There is something at work
beyond the evil of Smaug.

785
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:15,567
Something much more powerful.

786
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:21,856
We can remain blind to it, but it
will not be ignoring us. That, I can promise you.

787
01:35:21,814 --> 01:35:28,692
A sickness lies over the Greenwood.
The woodsmen living there call it Mirkwood.

788
01:35:28,625 --> 01:35:30,660
And they say...

789
01:35:31,384 --> 01:35:36,922
Well, don't stop now.
Tell us what the woodsmen say.

790
01:35:37,014 --> 01:35:41,270
They speak of a necromancer in
Dol Guldur.

791
01:35:41,242 --> 01:35:45,463
A sorcerer who can summon the dead.
- That's absurd.

792
01:35:45,566 --> 01:35:47,915
No such power exists in this world.

793
01:35:47,914 --> 01:35:52,724
This "Necromancer"
is nothing more than a mortal man.

794
01:35:52,818 --> 01:35:57,005
A conjurer dabbling in black magic.
-And so I thought too.

795
01:35:56,977 --> 01:36:00,920
But Radagast has seen...
-Radagast.

796
01:36:01,013 --> 01:36:06,482
Do not speak to me of Radagast the Brown.
He is a foolish fellow.

797
01:36:06,535 --> 01:36:10,826
Well, he's odd, I grant you that
and lives a solitary life.

798
01:36:10,797 --> 01:36:15,053
It's not that, it's his excessive
consumption of mushrooms.

799
01:36:15,158 --> 01:36:19,725
It addled his brains
and yellowed his teeth.

800
01:36:19,692 --> 01:36:24,347
I warned him. It is unbefitting for
one of the Istari to be wandering the woods...

801
01:36:24,366 --> 01:36:26,660
You carry something.

802
01:36:28,036 --> 01:36:31,444
It came to you from Radagast.

803
01:36:31,603 --> 01:36:36,517
He found it in Dol Guldur.
-Yes.

804
01:36:37,817 --> 01:36:40,359
Show me.

805
01:36:49,972 --> 01:36:52,109
What is that?

806
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:55,521
A relic of Mordor.

807
01:37:05,682 --> 01:37:07,728
A Morgul blade.

808
01:37:07,798 --> 01:37:11,393
Made for the Witch-King of Angmar.

809
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:13,918
And buried with him.

810
01:37:16,208 --> 01:37:18,363
When Angmar fell...

811
01:37:18,365 --> 01:37:22,108
the men of the north took
his body and all that he posessed...

812
01:37:22,088 --> 01:37:25,491
and sealed it within the high
fells* of Rhudaur.

813
01:37:25,545 --> 01:37:28,138
Deep within the rock they buried him.

814
01:37:28,715 --> 01:37:34,155
In a tomb so dark
it would never come to light.

815
01:37:34,109 --> 01:37:36,086
This is not possible.

816
01:37:36,931 --> 01:37:41,940
A powerful spell lies upon those tombs,
they cannot be opened.

817
01:37:41,900 --> 01:37:47,160
What proof do we have that this weapon came
from Angmar's grave?

818
01:37:47,161 --> 01:37:50,868
I have none.
-Because there is none.

819
01:37:51,494 --> 01:37:54,110
Let us examine what we know.

820
01:37:54,185 --> 01:37:59,091
A single Orc pack has dared
to cross the Bruinen.

821
01:37:59,266 --> 01:38:02,618
A dagger from the bygone age has been found.

822
01:38:02,918 --> 01:38:08,465
And a human sorcerer,
who calls himself "The Necromancer"...

823
01:38:08,547 --> 01:38:12,331
has taken up residence
in a ruined fortress.

824
01:38:12,841 --> 01:38:16,890
It's not so very much after all.

825
01:38:17,249 --> 01:38:22,216
The question of this dwarvish company,
however, troubles me deeply.

826
01:38:22,304 --> 01:38:27,818
I am not convinced, Gandalf.
I do not feeel I can condone such a quest.

827
01:38:28,070 --> 01:38:32,054
If they'd come to me,
I might have spared them the disappointment.

828
01:38:32,224 --> 01:38:35,035
I will not attempt to understand your
reasons to have hopes...

829
01:38:35,411 --> 01:38:38,027
They are leaving.

830
01:38:39,638 --> 01:38:41,199
Yes.

831
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:46,065
You knew.

832
01:38:50,131 --> 01:38:53,246
I'm afraid there is nothing else for us...

833
01:38:54,541 --> 01:38:59,121
My Lord Elrond.
The dwarves, they are gone.

834
01:39:04,677 --> 01:39:09,415
Be on your guard.
We are about to step over the edge of the wild.

835
01:39:09,634 --> 01:39:13,048
Balin. You know these parts, lead on.
-Alright.

836
01:39:18,863 --> 01:39:23,314
Master Baggins.
I suggest that you keep up.

837
01:39:36,675 --> 01:39:39,553
You will follow them?
-Yes.

838
01:39:39,635 --> 01:39:42,555
You're right to help
Thorin Oakenshield.

839
01:39:42,784 --> 01:39:49,399
But I fear that this quest has set in
motion forces we do not yet understand.

840
01:39:49,878 --> 01:39:53,982
The riddle of the Morgul blade
must be answered.

841
01:39:54,185 --> 01:39:59,434
Something moves in the shadows, unseen,
hidden from our sight, it will not show itself.

842
01:39:59,952 --> 01:40:04,565
Not yet.
But everyday it grows in strength.

843
01:40:04,699 --> 01:40:06,687
You must be careful.

844
01:40:11,284 --> 01:40:13,103
Mithrandir.

845
01:40:14,439 --> 01:40:19,937
Why the halfling?
-I do not know.

846
01:40:22,809 --> 01:40:28,887
Saruman believes that it is only
a great power that can hold evil in check.

847
01:40:30,129 --> 01:40:32,657
But that is not what I have found.

848
01:40:33,542 --> 01:40:37,857
I've found that it's the small things.

849
01:40:37,810 --> 01:40:43,224
Everyday deeds of ordinary folk
that keeps the darkness at bay.

850
01:40:43,507 --> 01:40:47,354
Simple acts of kindness and love.

851
01:40:49,125 --> 01:40:51,621
Why Bilbo Baggins?

852
01:40:54,136 --> 01:40:56,535
Perhaps it is because I'm afraid.

853
01:40:58,453 --> 01:41:00,463
And he gives me courage.

854
01:41:05,583 --> 01:41:08,610
Do not be afraid, Mithrandir.

855
01:41:10,664 --> 01:41:13,071
You're not alone.

856
01:43:04,310 --> 01:43:09,594
We must find shelter.
-Look out!

857
01:43:22,117 --> 01:43:26,021
This is no thunderstorm.
It's a thunder battle.

858
01:43:27,748 --> 01:43:29,591
Look!

859
01:43:33,661 --> 01:43:38,952
Well, bless me. The legends are true.
Giants!

860
01:43:38,908 --> 01:43:40,901
Stone Giants!

861
01:43:47,725 --> 01:43:50,378
Take cover, you fool!

862
01:44:00,975 --> 01:44:03,663
Watch out Kili.
-Grab my hand.

863
01:44:42,633 --> 01:44:45,082
Look out!

864
01:45:20,485 --> 01:45:25,484
No!

865
01:45:32,536 --> 01:45:34,588
No. Kili!

866
01:45:41,172 --> 01:45:43,828
We're alright, we're alive!

867
01:45:44,104 --> 01:45:47,485
Where is Bilbo?
- Where's the Hobbit?

868
01:45:48,197 --> 01:45:49,964
There.

869
01:45:56,048 --> 01:45:58,052
Grab my hand!
-Bilbo!

870
01:45:59,921 --> 01:46:01,747
Take it!

871
01:46:17,631 --> 01:46:19,237
Come on, up ya go.

872
01:46:22,308 --> 01:46:24,724
I thought we lost our burglar.

873
01:46:25,181 --> 01:46:28,191
He's been lost ever since he left home.

874
01:46:28,245 --> 01:46:30,161
He should never have come.

875
01:46:30,647 --> 01:46:33,263
He has no place amongst us.

876
01:46:34,164 --> 01:46:35,999
Dwalin.

877
01:46:41,541 --> 01:46:47,289
It looks safe enough. Further to the back.
Caves in the mountains are seldom unnocupied.

878
01:46:50,786 --> 01:46:53,054
There is nothing here.

879
01:46:54,416 --> 01:46:59,012
Right then. Let's get a fire started.
-No, no fires, not in this place.

880
01:46:59,813 --> 01:47:03,773
Get some sleep.
We start at first light.

881
01:47:04,369 --> 01:47:08,052
We are to wait in the mountains
until Gandalf joins us.

882
01:47:08,187 --> 01:47:11,020
That was the plan.
-Plan has changed.

883
01:47:11,045 --> 01:47:15,062
Bofur, take the first watch.

884
01:48:27,835 --> 01:48:29,791
Where do you think you're going?

885
01:48:32,668 --> 01:48:36,617
Back to Rivendell.
-No, you can't turn back now.

886
01:48:36,593 --> 01:48:40,507
You are part of the company.
You're one of us.

887
01:48:40,571 --> 01:48:43,383
I'm not now, am I?

888
01:48:43,989 --> 01:48:47,334
Thorin said I should never have come,
and he was right.

889
01:48:47,655 --> 01:48:51,447
I'm not a Took, I'm a Baggins.
I don't know what I was thinking.

890
01:48:52,203 --> 01:48:56,898
I should had never run out my home.
-You're homesick, I understand.

891
01:48:56,981 --> 01:48:59,339
No, you don't, you don't understand.
None of you do.

892
01:48:59,405 --> 01:49:03,936
You are dwarves.
You are used to this life, to living on the road.

893
01:49:03,903 --> 01:49:07,321
Never settling in one place, not belonging anywhere.

894
01:49:10,472 --> 01:49:13,518
I'm sorry, I didn't...

895
01:49:17,564 --> 01:49:19,963
No, you're right.

896
01:49:22,072 --> 01:49:24,721
We don't belong anywhere.

897
01:49:32,206 --> 01:49:35,096
I wish you all the luck in the world.

898
01:49:37,679 --> 01:49:39,843
I really do.

899
01:49:43,198 --> 01:49:45,372
What's that?

900
01:50:07,999 --> 01:50:10,375
Wake up. Wake up!

901
01:50:32,190 --> 01:50:33,926
Look out!

902
01:50:44,677 --> 01:50:46,763
Get back!

903
01:51:13,112 --> 01:51:15,075
Get off me!

904
01:53:00,456 --> 01:53:05,464
Who would be so bold
as to come armed into my kingdom?

905
01:53:06,054 --> 01:53:09,604
Spies? Thieves? Assassins?

906
01:53:09,755 --> 01:53:12,991
Dwarves, Your Malevolence.
-Dwarves?

907
01:53:13,684 --> 01:53:19,599
We found them on the front porch.
-Don't just stand there. Search them!

908
01:53:19,980 --> 01:53:23,126
Every crack, every crevace.

909
01:53:27,810 --> 01:53:33,194
What are you doing in these parts?
Speak!

910
01:53:35,157 --> 01:53:40,663
Very well, if they will not talk
we will make them squawk.

911
01:53:40,741 --> 01:53:45,304
Bring up the Angler.
Bring up the Bone Breaker.

912
01:53:45,501 --> 01:53:48,592
Start with the youngest.
-Wait!

913
01:53:51,023 --> 01:53:56,048
Well, well, well... look who it is.

914
01:53:57,617 --> 01:54:01,168
Thorin, son of Thrain,
son of Thror.

915
01:54:01,922 --> 01:54:04,906
King under the mountain.

916
01:54:06,535 --> 01:54:11,707
Oh! But I'm forgetting
you don't have a mountain, and you're not a king.

917
01:54:11,665 --> 01:54:16,359
Which makes you, nobody really.

918
01:54:18,927 --> 01:54:23,909
I know someone who would pay a pretty price
for your head.

919
01:54:24,613 --> 01:54:28,814
Just the head.
Nothing attached.

920
01:54:29,472 --> 01:54:33,482
Perhaps you know of whom I speak.

921
01:54:33,629 --> 01:54:36,599
An old enemy of yours.

922
01:54:38,615 --> 01:54:43,756
A pale Orc that strides a white Warg.

923
01:54:44,454 --> 01:54:48,607
Azog the Defiler was destroyed.

924
01:54:50,018 --> 01:54:52,552
He was slain in battle long ago.

925
01:54:52,633 --> 01:54:57,461
So you think his defiling days are done?
Do you?

926
01:54:58,596 --> 01:55:04,678
Send word to the pale Orc.
Tell him I have found his prize.

927
01:55:53,532 --> 01:55:56,192
Gollum.

928
01:56:23,822 --> 01:56:26,551
Goblinses.

929
01:56:26,742 --> 01:56:31,815
Better than old bones,
precious. Better than nothing.

930
01:56:58,949 --> 01:57:04,202
Too many boneses, precious.
Not enough flesh.

931
01:57:04,159 --> 01:57:10,383
Shut up. Cut the skin off.
Start with the head.

932
01:57:15,484 --> 01:57:19,605
The cold, old knives.
It cuts our heads.

933
01:57:19,707 --> 01:57:23,213
It gnaws our feet.

934
01:57:23,330 --> 01:57:30,009
Rocks and stones are like old bones.
No brain or meat.

935
01:57:30,487 --> 01:57:36,101
Cold as death, without no breath,
but it is good to eat.

936
01:58:13,739 --> 01:58:20,266
Precious, precious is precious.
That's a meaty mouthful.

937
01:58:21,792 --> 01:58:24,336
Gollum, Gollum

938
01:58:25,515 --> 01:58:30,016
Back, stay back.
I'm warning you.

939
01:58:30,053 --> 01:58:32,178
Don't come any closer.

940
01:58:33,486 --> 01:58:37,816
It's got an elvish blade,
but it's not an elves.

941
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:43,331
Not an elves, no.
What is it, precious?

942
01:58:44,250 --> 01:58:45,796
What is it?

943
01:58:45,808 --> 01:58:51,373
My name is Bilbo Baggins.
- Baggingses?

944
01:58:52,735 --> 01:58:56,236
What is a Baggingses, precious?

945
01:58:56,606 --> 01:59:00,916
I'm a hobbit from the Shire.

946
01:59:00,887 --> 01:59:06,497
Oh! We like Bagginses, batses and fishes,
but we haven't tried Hobbitses before.

947
01:59:07,481 --> 01:59:11,893
Is it soft, is it juicy?
-Now! Now!.

948
01:59:12,172 --> 01:59:17,074
I'll use this.
If I have to.

949
01:59:17,463 --> 01:59:20,419
I do not want trouble.
Do you understand that?

950
01:59:20,702 --> 01:59:25,896
Just show me the way out of here and I'll be on my way.
- Why? Is it lost?

951
01:59:26,015 --> 01:59:29,817
Yes, and I want to get unlost as soon as possible.

952
01:59:30,183 --> 01:59:34,909
We know a safe pass for the Hobbitses.
Safe pass, in the dark.

953
01:59:35,056 --> 01:59:37,336
Shut up!
- I didn't say anything.

954
01:59:37,337 --> 01:59:42,959
I wasn't talking to you.
Oh yes, we was precious, we was.

955
01:59:43,045 --> 01:59:47,793
I don't know what your game is, but...
-Games!

956
01:59:47,830 --> 01:59:52,429
Oh, we love games, doesn't we, precious?
Does it like games?

957
01:59:52,528 --> 01:59:55,378
Does it like to play?

958
01:59:55,371 --> 01:59:57,405
Maybe?

959
01:59:58,693 --> 02:00:03,334
What has roots that nobody sees?

960
02:00:03,527 --> 02:00:08,509
Is taller than trees...
Up, up, up it goes.

961
02:00:08,629 --> 02:00:11,406
and yet never grows?

962
02:00:12,542 --> 02:00:15,230
The mountain.

963
02:00:16,388 --> 02:00:21,822
Let's have another one, eh?
Do it again! Do it again, ask us.

964
02:00:22,158 --> 02:00:25,539
No! No more riddles.

965
02:00:25,524 --> 02:00:28,870
Finish him off, finish him now!
-Gollum, Gollum.

966
02:00:30,180 --> 02:00:35,333
No, I want to play. I do.

967
02:00:35,422 --> 02:00:41,250
I want to play.
I can see you're very good at this.

968
02:00:42,078 --> 02:00:48,012
Why don't we, have a game of riddles?

969
02:00:48,239 --> 02:00:51,520
Just you and me.

970
02:00:52,319 --> 02:00:54,788
Yes, just us.

971
02:00:54,786 --> 02:00:58,573
Yes, and if I win...

972
02:00:59,079 --> 02:01:01,980
you show me the way out. Yes?

973
02:01:04,968 --> 02:01:08,014
And if it loses?
What then?

974
02:01:08,004 --> 02:01:12,593
well, if it loses, my precious,
then we eat it.

975
02:01:12,916 --> 02:01:16,801
If Baggings loses
we eat it all.

976
02:01:22,490 --> 02:01:24,946
Fair enough.

977
02:01:28,783 --> 02:01:31,431
But Baggings first.

978
02:01:36,415 --> 02:01:39,409
30 White horses on a red hill.

979
02:01:39,970 --> 02:01:44,362
First they chomp, then they stomp,
then they stand still.

980
02:01:55,375 --> 02:01:58,624
Teeth? Teeth!

981
02:01:59,459 --> 02:02:01,527
That's right, precious.

982
02:02:01,660 --> 02:02:08,118
But we, we only have nine.

983
02:02:10,855 --> 02:02:15,894
Our turn.
Voiceless it cries.

984
02:02:16,227 --> 02:02:22,241
Wingless flutters.
Toothless bites.

985
02:02:22,713 --> 02:02:26,048
Mouthless mutters.

986
02:02:28,716 --> 02:02:30,575
Just a moment.

987
02:02:32,426 --> 02:02:37,304
Oh! We knows! We knows!
Shut up!

988
02:02:43,416 --> 02:02:47,470
Wind. It's wind.
Course it is.

989
02:02:48,138 --> 02:02:53,518
Very clever Hobbitses.
Very clever.

990
02:02:53,473 --> 02:02:58,464
A box without hinges, key or lid.

991
02:02:58,425 --> 02:03:02,855
Yet, a golden treasure
inside is hid.

992
02:03:03,878 --> 02:03:05,920
Oh...

993
02:03:08,778 --> 02:03:12,539
Box. Key. Lid.
-Well?

994
02:03:12,649 --> 02:03:14,741
It's nasty.

995
02:03:18,025 --> 02:03:22,291
Give up?
-Give us a chance, precious. Give us a chance!

996
02:03:34,908 --> 02:03:38,011
Eggses.

997
02:03:38,659 --> 02:03:41,949
White crumpty* little eggses.

998
02:03:42,087 --> 02:03:46,844
Grandma taught us to suck them. Yes!

999
02:03:54,464 --> 02:03:57,507
We have one for you.

1000
02:03:58,212 --> 02:04:02,519
All things it devours.

1001
02:04:02,771 --> 02:04:07,488
Birds, beasts, trees, flowers.

1002
02:04:07,854 --> 02:04:11,943
Gnaws iron, bites steel...

1003
02:04:12,123 --> 02:04:15,843
grinds hard stone to mill.

1004
02:04:17,663 --> 02:04:23,325
Answer us.
-Give me a moment, please.
I gave you a good long while.

1005
02:04:25,626 --> 02:04:29,261
Beasts?
I don't know this one.

1006
02:04:29,303 --> 02:04:31,872
Is it tasty?

1007
02:04:32,724 --> 02:04:36,580
Is it scrumptious?

1008
02:04:37,252 --> 02:04:41,563
Is it crunchy?
- Let me think.

1009
02:04:46,665 --> 02:04:48,733
It's stuck.

1010
02:04:49,491 --> 02:04:53,950
Baggingses is stuck.

1011
02:04:57,591 --> 02:04:59,950
Time's up.

1012
02:05:02,882 --> 02:05:07,519
Time? Time...the answer is time.

1013
02:05:09,682 --> 02:05:15,245
Actually it wasn't that hard.
-Last question.

1014
02:05:16,707 --> 02:05:19,153
Last chance.

1015
02:05:22,663 --> 02:05:24,852
Ask us.

1016
02:05:25,819 --> 02:05:28,508
Ask us!
- Yes, yes, alright.

1017
02:05:33,112 --> 02:05:37,213
What have I got in my pocket?

1018
02:05:39,891 --> 02:05:42,423
That's no fair.

1019
02:05:42,642 --> 02:05:46,336
That's no fair.
It's against the rules.

1020
02:05:47,319 --> 02:05:52,776
Ask us another one.
-No, no you said, ask me a question.

1021
02:05:52,759 --> 02:05:57,358
Well, that is my question.
What have I got in my pocket?

1022
02:05:58,754 --> 02:06:02,002
We can guess three times, my darling.

1023
02:06:02,294 --> 02:06:04,524
Three guesses, precious. You must give us three guesses.
-Three guesses, very well, guess away.

1024
02:06:04,649 --> 02:06:07,690
Handses.
-Wrong. Guess again.

1025
02:06:09,229 --> 02:06:14,214
Fish bones. Goblin's Teeth?
Bat Wings.

1026
02:06:15,635 --> 02:06:19,995
Knife! Oh, shut up.
-Wrong, again. Last guess.

1027
02:06:19,965 --> 02:06:23,386
String. Or nothing.

1028
02:06:23,370 --> 02:06:27,219
Two guesses at once,
wrong both times.

1029
02:06:29,656 --> 02:06:31,411
So...

1030
02:06:32,784 --> 02:06:36,882
Come on then. I won the game
you promised to show me the way out.

1031
02:06:37,312 --> 02:06:42,592
Did we say so, precious?
Did we say so?

1032
02:06:46,133 --> 02:06:50,989
What has it got in its pocketses?

1033
02:06:52,039 --> 02:06:56,289
That's no concern of yours.
You lost.

1034
02:06:56,784 --> 02:06:58,490
Lost?

1035
02:07:00,446 --> 02:07:02,095
Lost?

1036
02:07:03,442 --> 02:07:05,575
Lost?

1037
02:07:11,259 --> 02:07:12,904
Where is it?

1038
02:07:14,218 --> 02:07:17,637
Where is it?
No.

1039
02:07:20,067 --> 02:07:22,904
Where is it?
No.

1040
02:07:25,642 --> 02:07:29,737
Lost.
Precious, it's lost.

1041
02:07:29,845 --> 02:07:33,431
My precious is lost.

1042
02:07:35,165 --> 02:07:40,376
What have you lost?
-Musn't ask us. No it's business. No.

1043
02:07:41,405 --> 02:07:43,716
Gollum.

1044
02:07:56,838 --> 02:08:00,392
What has it got...

1045
02:08:00,507 --> 02:08:06,378
in its nasty, little pocketses?

1046
02:08:16,021 --> 02:08:18,049
It stole it.

1047
02:08:18,808 --> 02:08:21,762
It stole it.

1048
02:08:24,999 --> 02:08:27,184
It stole it!

1049
02:08:32,440 --> 02:08:35,997
enemies are defeated*
the following we hang on*

1050
02:08:36,333 --> 02:08:39,822
We store and beech*
to a few branches are hung*

1051
02:08:39,805 --> 02:08:44,237
they are here and are never found*

1052
02:08:44,634 --> 02:08:47,854
down in the deeps of Goblin Town

1053
02:08:50,921 --> 02:08:55,610
I know that sword.
It is the Goblin Cleaver.

1054
02:08:55,600 --> 02:09:00,370
The Biter. The blade that sliced
a thousand necks.

1055
02:09:00,334 --> 02:09:04,206
Crush them. Kill them.

1056
02:09:04,405 --> 02:09:08,000
Kill them all.
Cut off his head.

1057
02:09:37,669 --> 02:09:41,694
Take up arms. Fight!

1058
02:09:43,099 --> 02:09:45,167
Fight!

1059
02:09:50,798 --> 02:09:53,500
He wields the Foe-Hammer.

1060
02:09:53,461 --> 02:09:56,614
Bright as daylight.

1061
02:10:20,161 --> 02:10:23,346
Follow me. Quick!

1062
02:10:25,739 --> 02:10:27,453
Run!

1063
02:10:35,226 --> 02:10:40,259
Give it to us.

1064
02:10:56,595 --> 02:10:58,792
It's ours.

1065
02:10:59,387 --> 02:11:02,518
It's ours!

1066
02:11:26,231 --> 02:11:28,566
Thief!

1067
02:11:30,131 --> 02:11:32,682
Baggins!

1068
02:11:52,845 --> 02:11:55,554
Charge!

1069
02:12:44,106 --> 02:12:46,671
Cut the ropes!

1070
02:13:08,694 --> 02:13:11,221
Be quick!

1071
02:13:23,971 --> 02:13:25,456
Jump!

1072
02:14:31,214 --> 02:14:34,440
You thought you could escape me?

1073
02:14:37,401 --> 02:14:39,951
What are you going to do now, Wizard?

1074
02:14:48,466 --> 02:14:50,559
That will do it.

1075
02:15:24,855 --> 02:15:26,915
Well, that could have been worse.

1076
02:15:29,681 --> 02:15:32,446
You've got to be joking.

1077
02:15:37,906 --> 02:15:39,496
Gandalf!

1078
02:15:43,805 --> 02:15:48,285
There's too many, we can't fight them.
-Only light can now save us, daylight.

1079
02:15:48,383 --> 02:15:51,567
Come on. Here, on your feet.

1080
02:15:58,206 --> 02:16:02,850
Wait, my precious.
Wait.

1081
02:16:03,697 --> 02:16:06,751
Gollum, Gollum.

1082
02:17:51,849 --> 02:17:56,002
Baggings! Thief!

1083
02:17:56,135 --> 02:18:01,419
Curse it and crush it.
We hates it forever!

1084
02:18:13,294 --> 02:18:17,129
Five, six, seven, eight...

1085
02:18:17,297 --> 02:18:21,628
Bifur and Bofur. That is ten.
And Fili and Kili. That is twelve.

1086
02:18:21,837 --> 02:18:24,638
And Bombur. That makes thirteen.

1087
02:18:25,325 --> 02:18:29,831
Where is Bilbo?
Where is our Hobbit?

1088
02:18:31,075 --> 02:18:32,812
Where is our Hobbit?

1089
02:18:34,142 --> 02:18:35,869
Curse the halfling.

1090
02:18:36,877 --> 02:18:40,255
Now he's lost? I thought he was with Dori.
-Dont' blame me!

1091
02:18:40,239 --> 02:18:44,935
Where did you last see him?
-I think I saw him slip away when they first cornered us.

1092
02:18:44,985 --> 02:18:48,553
What happened exactly? Tell me!
-I'll tell you what happened.

1093
02:18:48,765 --> 02:18:51,864
Master Baggins saw his chance
and he took it.

1094
02:18:52,272 --> 02:18:55,434
He has thought of nothing but
his soft bed and his warm hearth...

1095
02:18:55,486 --> 02:18:57,772
since he first stepped out of his door.

1096
02:18:57,988 --> 02:19:03,016
We will not be seeing our Hobbit again.
He's long gone.

1097
02:19:16,109 --> 02:19:17,957
No, he isn't.

1098
02:19:21,286 --> 02:19:26,143
Bilbo Baggins!
I've never been so glad to see anyone in my life.

1099
02:19:28,243 --> 02:19:32,369
Bilbo, we had given you up.
-How on earth did you get past the Goblins?

1100
02:19:32,445 --> 02:19:34,040
How indeed.

1101
02:19:42,418 --> 02:19:45,433
Oh, what does it matter?
He's back.

1102
02:19:46,826 --> 02:19:49,829
It matters.
I want to know.

1103
02:19:51,491 --> 02:19:53,743
Why did you come back?

1104
02:19:56,655 --> 02:20:00,515
Look, I know you doubt me.
I know you always have.

1105
02:20:01,104 --> 02:20:06,447
And you're right, I often think of Bag End.
I miss my books.

1106
02:20:07,410 --> 02:20:10,051
And my armchair and my garden.

1107
02:20:11,211 --> 02:20:14,559
See, that's where I belong.
That's home.

1108
02:20:16,570 --> 02:20:18,704
That's why I came back.

1109
02:20:21,026 --> 02:20:23,831
You don't have one. A home.

1110
02:20:24,490 --> 02:20:26,255
It was taken from you.

1111
02:20:29,030 --> 02:20:32,397
But I will help you
take it back if I can.

1112
02:21:04,921 --> 02:21:10,471
Out of the frying pan...
-And into the fire. Run. Run!

1113
02:21:53,715 --> 02:21:57,776
Up onto the trees. All of you.
Come on! Climb! Bilbo!

1114
02:22:09,047 --> 02:22:11,141
They're coming!

1115
02:23:10,862 --> 02:23:12,646
Azog.

1116
02:23:38,849 --> 02:23:41,085
It cannot be.

1117
02:25:23,030 --> 02:25:24,621
Fili.

1118
02:26:12,667 --> 02:26:16,499
Mr. Gandalf!

1119
02:27:50,534 --> 02:27:52,584
No!

1120
02:28:03,734 --> 02:28:05,998
Thorin!

1121
02:31:50,580 --> 02:31:52,896
Thorin?

1122
02:33:29,451 --> 02:33:35,149
The halfling?
-It's alright. Bilbo is here.

1123
02:33:35,666 --> 02:33:37,694
He's quite safe.

1124
02:33:46,766 --> 02:33:48,448
You.

1125
02:33:51,749 --> 02:33:55,645
What were you doing?
You nearly got yourself killed.

1126
02:33:58,230 --> 02:34:01,064
Did I not tell you that you would be a burden...

1127
02:34:01,299 --> 02:34:04,578
that you would not survive in the wild?

1128
02:34:05,152 --> 02:34:07,880
That you have no place amongst us.

1129
02:34:12,834 --> 02:34:16,457
I have never been so wrong, in all my life.

1130
02:34:28,652 --> 02:34:33,047
But I'm sorry I doubted you.
-No, I would have doubted me too.

1131
02:34:33,366 --> 02:34:36,577
I'm not a hero or a warrior.

1132
02:34:37,960 --> 02:34:40,874
Not even a burglar.

1133
02:34:58,690 --> 02:35:01,964
Is that what I think it is?

1134
02:35:16,263 --> 02:35:17,920
Erebor.

1135
02:35:18,948 --> 02:35:20,928
The Lonely Mountain.

1136
02:35:20,964 --> 02:35:25,907
The last of the great dwarf kingdoms of Middle-Earth.

1137
02:35:27,910 --> 02:35:30,357
Our home.

1138
02:35:34,057 --> 02:35:38,746
A raven!
The birds are returning to the mountain.

1139
02:35:42,213 --> 02:35:46,055
That, my dear Oin, is a thrush.

1140
02:35:46,793 --> 02:35:50,927
Well, we'll take it as a sign, a good omen.

1141
02:35:50,900 --> 02:35:55,888
You're right.
I do believe the worst is behind us.
