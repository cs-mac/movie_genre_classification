1
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,400
Even then I had a bad feeling.

2
00:00:48,276 --> 00:00:51,576
I felt like a grey mouse, heading
right for the mouth of a cat.

3
00:00:51,726 --> 00:00:54,526
And there was nothing...
nothing I could do about it

4
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,070
Since my mother had died of
stomach cancer three years before,

5
00:01:05,434 --> 00:01:06,534
I was beginning to forget

6
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,175
what she looked like.

7
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,960
When I looked in her compact
and saw my own face,

8
00:01:16,553 --> 00:01:17,953
I could remember hers.

9
00:01:19,428 --> 00:01:20,728
The powder smelled
like when I kissed

10
00:01:20,962 --> 00:01:21,962
her cheek.

11
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:27,429
My mother...

12
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:29,355
she would never have
sent me to boarding

13
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,289
school.

14
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,880
It... it does get easier.
Really.

15
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,910
Oh, no, I'm fine. Really.

16
00:03:00,744 --> 00:03:04,244
Listen, I'd like you
to meet someone fantastic.

17
00:03:04,578 --> 00:03:05,478
Victoria!

18
00:03:06,591 --> 00:03:08,691
-Victoria, come and meet Mary.
-Okay. Just a minute.

19
00:03:11,097 --> 00:03:13,197
The food is really gross though.
Totally hospital, right?

20
00:03:13,397 --> 00:03:17,097
So we mostly save our allowances
and like order pizza or Chinese.

21
00:03:17,423 --> 00:03:20,623
And well.. you know,
the anorexics just eat erasers.

22
00:03:22,023 --> 00:03:23,223
I'm serious.

23
00:03:28,063 --> 00:03:31,063
We can get away with anything
up here. I mean anything.

24
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:34,951
Wow! You're so out of shape!

25
00:03:35,155 --> 00:03:38,055
Come jogging with us or you'll
have a stroke before you're twenty.

26
00:03:39,277 --> 00:03:41,777
So... this is the bathroom
and the showers.

27
00:03:42,632 --> 00:03:46,232
-What's your name again?
-Most people just call me "Mouse."

28
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:50,150
-Mouse?
-My dad's always called me that.

29
00:03:50,684 --> 00:03:52,284
Really? How come?

30
00:03:54,326 --> 00:03:57,326
My dad used to call me "Princess."
Made me barf.

31
00:03:57,489 --> 00:03:58,389
Better than "Mouse."

32
00:04:01,995 --> 00:04:03,495
Mine's the messy one.

33
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,519
Of course. Major Slobberina.

34
00:04:07,074 --> 00:04:09,474
I can't help it. It's like rage
at my mother or something, right?

35
00:04:09,663 --> 00:04:12,463
And that's Paulie's.
This is mine. And...

36
00:04:14,168 --> 00:04:16,168
This one is yours.

37
00:04:20,206 --> 00:04:21,106
Sorry.

38
00:04:32,955 --> 00:04:33,555
Hey...

39
00:04:34,393 --> 00:04:35,393
Look, I know

40
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:36,743
it's weird at first.

41
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:39,744
But now, this is much more
home to me than home.

42
00:04:41,965 --> 00:04:43,965
Like the Lost Boys
in "Peter Pan," right?

43
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,870
Except we're the Lost Girls, right?

44
00:04:46,278 --> 00:04:47,678
"Lost and Delirious."

45
00:04:51,263 --> 00:04:53,763
So when you're finished up here,
come party with us, okay?

46
00:06:08,712 --> 00:06:09,712
Want a smoke?

47
00:06:11,491 --> 00:06:12,791
Did I scare you?

48
00:06:15,134 --> 00:06:16,234
You got "New Girl"
written all over you,

49
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:17,376
don't you?

50
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,110
Like a fresh new lamb.
What are you? 13? 1 4?

51
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,910
Some kind of brainiac?
Skipped a few grades?

52
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:30,187
I'm Paulie... Oster.

53
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:36,538
Mary Bedford.
Mouse really.

54
00:06:37,276 --> 00:06:38,276
They call me.

55
00:06:39,193 --> 00:06:41,193
I'd rather call you
"Shithead" than "Mouse."

56
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:44,999
So you're rooming
with me and Tory, huh?

57
00:06:46,095 --> 00:06:48,095
Yeah. That's what Miss Vaughn said.

58
00:06:48,299 --> 00:06:50,599
Well, I guess she didn't like us
up there all by our lonesome.

59
00:06:55,488 --> 00:06:57,888
I've neve been
to a boarding school before.

60
00:06:59,131 --> 00:07:02,631
Well, now you're one of the
Lost Girls. Welcome to the club.

61
00:07:04,115 --> 00:07:04,815
Come on.

62
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,240
Help me spike the punch.

63
00:07:08,524 --> 00:07:10,124
Let's get this party off its butt.

64
00:07:10,537 --> 00:07:11,837
Rage more.

65
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,580
Rage more.

66
00:07:26,065 --> 00:07:28,365
Hey, girls.
Mind if we crash your tea party?

67
00:07:28,557 --> 00:07:31,157
Go away!
God, my brother is so annoying.

68
00:07:31,433 --> 00:07:32,933
He's cute, though.

69
00:07:33,254 --> 00:07:35,954
Hey, boys, can't you read the sign?
No dickheads allowed.

70
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:37,618
Fuck, she's special, huh?

71
00:07:45,907 --> 00:07:47,207
And now I really want some tea.

72
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:49,428
Yeah... Can a dickhead have some

73
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,750
tea, please?

74
00:08:04,214 --> 00:08:05,714
You're my morning glory, Tory.

75
00:08:06,995 --> 00:08:08,495
Are you guys ready to party?

76
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,820
Yeah!

77
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:41,248
Paulie!

78
00:08:41,501 --> 00:08:42,901
Paulie, Paulie...

79
00:08:43,035 --> 00:08:43,735
What?

80
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,190
I think young Paulie
just spiked the punch.

81
00:08:46,869 --> 00:08:48,469
Shall we pretend we don't know?

82
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,890
I'd love to do that.
And I know you'd love that too.

83
00:08:52,429 --> 00:08:56,329
But that wouldn't be very good
"teachering," would it, Ms. Bannet?

84
00:09:03,356 --> 00:09:04,556
I can't do that.

85
00:09:09,491 --> 00:09:13,491
Before that day, I never knew what
people meant when they said "fun."

86
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,263
I was like some kind of Dr. Spock.

87
00:09:16,871 --> 00:09:19,571
"And what is this "fun"?"
I don't know.

88
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:24,089
It was like she kind of put a spell
on me and all my foreboding,

89
00:09:24,252 --> 00:09:26,352
that feeling I had, just...

90
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:28,431
kind of vanished.

91
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,820
Hey, New Girl.

92
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:35,129
What do you think of Vonny?

93
00:09:35,467 --> 00:09:37,367
Don't call her "New Girl."
It's so rude.

94
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,930
Miss Vaughn? She's nice.

95
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:45,139
Some of the girls say
rude things about her.

96
00:09:46,298 --> 00:09:47,698
She and Bannet...

97
00:09:47,832 --> 00:09:49,232
they got it going for sure.

98
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:52,124
Paulie, give it a rest.

99
00:09:52,337 --> 00:09:55,337
She's just a single lady and they're
very good friends. And that's it.

100
00:09:55,979 --> 00:09:56,879
Don't be so mean.

101
00:09:57,033 --> 00:09:58,433
And homophobic.

102
00:09:58,663 --> 00:09:59,963
She seemed nice to me.

103
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,160
I mean, um...

104
00:10:03,264 --> 00:10:05,264
normal. Well, not...

105
00:10:05,469 --> 00:10:08,669
I'm not saying she's not nice,
New Girl. I'm saying she's a lezbo,

106
00:10:08,824 --> 00:10:10,224
and she's got the hots

107
00:10:10,454 --> 00:10:12,554
for Tory here.

108
00:10:12,754 --> 00:10:14,054
Who can blame her, right?
Miss Beautiful.

109
00:10:20,614 --> 00:10:21,614
Sorry.

110
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,030
I wasn't really sure

111
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,780
what I had just seen.

112
00:11:21,671 --> 00:11:24,371
I know this sounds like naive,

113
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:26,843
but at first...

114
00:11:27,327 --> 00:11:30,027
I thought they were like,
practicing for boys.

115
00:11:31,737 --> 00:11:36,037
In Rainy River, you see, nothing had
really changed since the fifties.

116
00:11:44,868 --> 00:11:46,368
It's morning time, you lazy sluts.

117
00:11:47,265 --> 00:11:50,365
-Out of bed or we kick your butts!
-Ally, get out of my face.

118
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,320
I mean it.

119
00:11:53,207 --> 00:11:55,907
Mary, this is my sister Ally.
She's a moron, aren't you, Ally?

120
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,141
And she has warts like all over

121
00:11:58,288 --> 00:11:59,988
her toes! It's really gross.

122
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,175
-Get your gross toes out of my bed.
-Don't listen to her, Mary.

123
00:12:03,368 --> 00:12:04,668
My toes are perfect.

124
00:12:05,573 --> 00:12:07,673
Now get your fat
stinking butt out of here.

125
00:12:09,407 --> 00:12:10,707
Out, out, out!
Come back and I'm gonna

126
00:12:10,941 --> 00:12:12,841
whip your butt.
Fucking teenyboppers!

127
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,875
Fucking grow up!

128
00:12:22,634 --> 00:12:24,934
Hey, I think there's
blueberry pancakes today.

129
00:12:25,798 --> 00:12:26,598
God.

130
00:12:42,955 --> 00:12:44,155
Wake up.

131
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,281
-Mary. Laurie.
-Hi. How are you?

132
00:12:47,556 --> 00:12:48,356
Hi.

133
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,469
Oh, this looks so amazing.

134
00:12:51,773 --> 00:12:54,273
I could totally give
my life for blueberry pancakes.

135
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,500
Don't you love
blueberry pancakes, Mouse?

136
00:12:57,717 --> 00:12:58,317
Yeah.

137
00:12:58,483 --> 00:12:59,983
Hey, hey, hey.
No bottom feeders!

138
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:01,409
-Out!
-Get out!

139
00:13:01,551 --> 00:13:02,151
Come on.

140
00:13:03,564 --> 00:13:05,964
Out! Out! Out!

141
00:13:21,296 --> 00:13:24,896
We want to define
the minimum value of the quadratic

142
00:13:26,185 --> 00:13:27,185
function.

143
00:13:27,335 --> 00:13:28,435
Now in order to do this, we must

144
00:13:28,773 --> 00:13:31,373
complete the square.
Since we know

145
00:13:31,553 --> 00:13:32,453
the leading coefficient is...

146
00:13:34,811 --> 00:13:35,911
We know, this, ladies.

147
00:13:36,537 --> 00:13:37,437
-Cordelia?
-One.

148
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:38,783
One. Yes.

149
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:40,033
Thank you.

150
00:13:40,371 --> 00:13:41,571
We simply add

151
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,688
half

152
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:46,622
of a linear term

153
00:13:48,326 --> 00:13:51,926
to "X" and square the result.

154
00:13:52,353 --> 00:13:55,453
To get the constant term of 11...

155
00:13:58,104 --> 00:13:58,704
Victoria?

156
00:14:01,267 --> 00:14:02,067
Yes?

157
00:14:02,226 --> 00:14:04,026
Come. Help me.

158
00:14:05,101 --> 00:14:06,001
You...

159
00:14:06,635 --> 00:14:08,235
want me to do the problem?

160
00:14:08,456 --> 00:14:10,456
Yes, I want you
to do the problem.

161
00:14:12,194 --> 00:14:14,094
Okay. I'll try.

162
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:29,602
What seems to be the delay?

163
00:14:29,927 --> 00:14:30,827
Victoria?

164
00:14:31,749 --> 00:14:32,949
I don't get it.

165
00:14:35,103 --> 00:14:36,103
And what

166
00:14:36,349 --> 00:14:40,249
is it exactly
that you don't get?

167
00:14:43,155 --> 00:14:45,055
The... the "X". I mean like...

168
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,360
Like where do you get the "X"?
I mean...

169
00:14:48,522 --> 00:14:49,422
why?

170
00:14:50,343 --> 00:14:51,843
What is...

171
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,060
what is an "X"?
Like...

172
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,058
You don't get what the "X" is?

173
00:15:01,271 --> 00:15:02,671
Perhaps if you spent less

174
00:15:02,805 --> 00:15:05,405
time gabbing and a little
more time listening...

175
00:15:05,585 --> 00:15:06,185
"Gabbing?"

176
00:15:08,556 --> 00:15:10,756
I consider that word
a punch in the face, Ms. Bannet.

177
00:15:11,432 --> 00:15:13,232
I beg your pardon, Pauline?

178
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,845
It's a word males use
to shoot us down.

179
00:15:16,128 --> 00:15:17,628
To trivialize
our talking to each other.

180
00:15:17,853 --> 00:15:19,153
You want to be part
of that shit, huh?

181
00:15:21,017 --> 00:15:23,417
Pauline Oster, you will not

182
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,000
use that kind of language

183
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,430
in my class again.

184
00:15:26,768 --> 00:15:28,068
Do you hear me?

185
00:15:28,685 --> 00:15:29,985
Do you hear me?

186
00:15:30,602 --> 00:15:32,202
I have had it up to here...

187
00:15:32,615 --> 00:15:35,215
Up to my eyeballs
with your disrespect.

188
00:15:35,683 --> 00:15:39,083
-What do you think you're doing?
-Teaching. What you should've done.

189
00:15:39,325 --> 00:15:39,925
Paulie, please.

190
00:15:40,092 --> 00:15:41,992
-It's okay.
-Out of my classroom!

191
00:15:42,296 --> 00:15:44,296
You will go to Miss Vaughn's

192
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,000
and explain why you are not in my
class and suffer the consequences.

193
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:50,981
Do you hear me?

194
00:15:52,073 --> 00:15:54,373
Am I not clear?

195
00:15:57,441 --> 00:16:00,441
You have a nice day now, Eleanor.

196
00:16:11,915 --> 00:16:14,015
-So what's your next class?
-Reading.

197
00:16:14,215 --> 00:16:17,815
-Down the hall. On your right, okay?
-Yeah.

198
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:19,745
you'll be fine.
Bye.

199
00:16:21,692 --> 00:16:26,292
That's it. You know you don't own
her. Victoria can speak for herself.

200
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,585
Do you understand?

201
00:16:27,826 --> 00:16:29,226
-Do you understand?
-She wasn't thinking. She...

202
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,960
She wasn't saying anything.

203
00:16:31,277 --> 00:16:33,477
-She was saying what she wanted to.
-She wasn't. She was just saying...

204
00:16:33,673 --> 00:16:34,973
It is her class.

205
00:16:35,207 --> 00:16:38,407
I will not have you terrorizing
my school. Do you hear?

206
00:17:27,638 --> 00:17:29,238
Who wants to hear the letter
to my blood mother?

207
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,560
You wrote it?

208
00:17:32,431 --> 00:17:34,331
Did they actually
give you her address?

209
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,240
No. But they said
they'd send it on to her.

210
00:17:37,511 --> 00:17:40,811
And then if she's into it,
we can have like... a meeting.

211
00:17:42,879 --> 00:17:43,979
I know.
That would be so

212
00:17:44,317 --> 00:17:45,317
fucking...

213
00:17:50,643 --> 00:17:51,743
"Dear my real Mother,

214
00:17:53,902 --> 00:17:55,102
Don't be scared.

215
00:17:55,436 --> 00:17:57,236
It's totally okay
that you gave me up.

216
00:17:57,449 --> 00:17:59,449
You were only a kid,
I totally understand.

217
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:03,612
Don't be scared of me.
I'm not scary.

218
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,400
I know you had a hard life.

219
00:18:07,034 --> 00:18:08,434
And I have had a pretty good one.

220
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:12,547
Comfortable, you know,
if a little chilly.

221
00:18:13,648 --> 00:18:17,348
Well, I imagine you living in some
apartment in Gerard and Parliament

222
00:18:17,578 --> 00:18:20,078
selling your ass for a living.
And I just thought

223
00:18:20,262 --> 00:18:22,762
I'd get in touch and we could
go for a beer sometime.

224
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:25,879
Your loving daughter,

225
00:18:26,588 --> 00:18:27,488
Paulie.

226
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:29,509
P.S. Janet,

227
00:18:29,751 --> 00:18:33,351
my fake mother, she smiles without
her eyes and her hands are cold."

228
00:18:36,844 --> 00:18:38,544
I really hope she answers, P.

229
00:18:39,624 --> 00:18:43,024
When she's old, I'm gonna
carry her around on my back.

230
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:45,917
You've never even met her?

231
00:18:47,868 --> 00:18:50,268
Children's Aid took me
away from her in hospital.

232
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,630
She held me for one whole day.

233
00:18:53,331 --> 00:18:54,631
Every minute.

234
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,219
That's what they told me.

235
00:18:58,987 --> 00:19:01,787
I never write to my mom.
We always like talk on the phone.

236
00:19:01,957 --> 00:19:04,657
Maybe that's why you
never say what you mean?

237
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,433
I can't say what I mean, P.

238
00:19:07,421 --> 00:19:10,521
I mean, how could I ever
really say to her what I mean?

239
00:19:11,447 --> 00:19:12,647
Even in a letter.

240
00:19:14,131 --> 00:19:15,131
I mean like,

241
00:19:15,953 --> 00:19:17,253
"Dear Mommy, I hate you.

242
00:19:18,349 --> 00:19:22,349
The most recent reason being that
you went on about my teeth at Easter

243
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,362
in front of all your gross friends.

244
00:19:25,442 --> 00:19:26,742
You want me to be like...

245
00:19:26,976 --> 00:19:29,776
your perfect Junior League girl,
and grow up to do like

246
00:19:30,042 --> 00:19:34,042
charity balls and be like the
concubine of some banker. Like you.

247
00:19:37,423 --> 00:19:38,923
But the truth of it is

248
00:19:40,587 --> 00:19:42,487
I am addicted to you.

249
00:19:44,037 --> 00:19:45,737
Like chocolate.

250
00:19:46,242 --> 00:19:49,042
I'm like I just always
want to be around you.

251
00:19:50,363 --> 00:19:52,663
I'm just like some stupid little
puppy, and you just keep kicking

252
00:19:52,855 --> 00:19:54,555
my teeth in with your words.

253
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:56,261
No, your tone.

254
00:19:56,594 --> 00:19:57,894
And sometimes...

255
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,620
I don't know...

256
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:03,366
sometimes I wish you were dead."

257
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,500
Rage more, Victoria.

258
00:20:08,672 --> 00:20:10,072
I can't believe I just said that.

259
00:20:16,627 --> 00:20:17,727
My stepmother's always talking

260
00:20:17,874 --> 00:20:19,474
about me when I'm there.

261
00:20:21,036 --> 00:20:21,936
I hate it.

262
00:20:23,721 --> 00:20:25,021
I hate her.

263
00:20:25,638 --> 00:20:26,738
I think she's jealous

264
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,280
of my closeness to my dad.

265
00:20:28,897 --> 00:20:30,897
Tory's mom's
insanely jealous of her.

266
00:20:32,443 --> 00:20:33,943
Creeps me fuck out.

267
00:20:34,648 --> 00:20:36,648
Why would she be jealous of me?

268
00:20:38,194 --> 00:20:39,094
What?

269
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,050
Hey, Mary.
You didn't do your letter yet?

270
00:20:53,818 --> 00:20:55,518
Oh. She died three years ago.

271
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,310
I'm sorry.

272
00:20:58,036 --> 00:20:59,236
No, it's okay.

273
00:21:00,816 --> 00:21:02,816
I just don't see the point
of writing her a letter.

274
00:21:03,308 --> 00:21:04,608
Maybe she could hear you, you know?

275
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:08,067
If I did write her a letter...

276
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:09,092
Go for it.

277
00:21:12,797 --> 00:21:13,997
"Dear Mother,

278
00:21:16,152 --> 00:21:19,552
Remember you asked me
when you were sick...

279
00:21:21,328 --> 00:21:22,628
well, dying...?

280
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,591
It was fall.

281
00:21:26,504 --> 00:21:27,604
October.

282
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,655
Still hot that year,
and your room

283
00:21:33,406 --> 00:21:35,906
it smelled like
sweet rotten apples.

284
00:21:41,361 --> 00:21:43,661
And I was holding
your head in my arms

285
00:21:46,058 --> 00:21:48,258
and your breathing was so fast

286
00:21:50,371 --> 00:21:52,571
and like shallow...

287
00:21:56,889 --> 00:21:58,289
You said, 'Mary,

288
00:21:59,094 --> 00:22:00,294
please

289
00:22:01,395 --> 00:22:02,795
remember me.'

290
00:22:05,516 --> 00:22:06,916
And the thing is

291
00:22:08,008 --> 00:22:11,108
I do sometimes forget
what you Iook like..."

292
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:19,069
Brave.

293
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,340
Do you really not remember
what she looked like?

294
00:22:26,508 --> 00:22:27,808
Sometimes.

295
00:22:29,863 --> 00:22:32,163
Oh, God, that is so incredibly sad.

296
00:22:33,697 --> 00:22:34,497
"Brave."

297
00:22:35,518 --> 00:22:37,918
That's your new name.
Mary B.

298
00:22:38,682 --> 00:22:40,082
"B" for "Brave."

299
00:22:42,707 --> 00:22:43,607
"Mouse" is dead.

300
00:22:44,337 --> 00:22:46,037
We're glad you're
our new roommate, Mary.

301
00:22:46,254 --> 00:22:47,654
Aren't we, Paulie?

302
00:22:47,979 --> 00:22:51,079
Duh. Are you glad to be our new
roommate, Mary Brave?

303
00:22:51,334 --> 00:22:53,034
Come on. Truth. Be honest.

304
00:24:29,295 --> 00:24:30,395
Excuse me.

305
00:24:32,459 --> 00:24:33,759
I was wondering...

306
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:35,759
Would you?

307
00:24:36,005 --> 00:24:37,205
Could you?

308
00:24:37,731 --> 00:24:38,931
You like to garden?

309
00:24:39,073 --> 00:24:39,673
Yeah.

310
00:24:40,702 --> 00:24:42,602
Yes. I used to do it every day,

311
00:24:42,811 --> 00:24:44,411
like from April till it snowed

312
00:24:44,632 --> 00:24:45,832
with my mother.
Before

313
00:24:45,974 --> 00:24:46,974
she passed away.

314
00:24:49,137 --> 00:24:50,137
A couple of years ago.

315
00:24:51,821 --> 00:24:52,921
I'm sorry to hear that.

316
00:24:53,067 --> 00:24:56,467
So, I was wondering if maybe
you could use some help sometime?

317
00:24:56,709 --> 00:24:58,709
Or, if you'd rather not,
that's totally fine.

318
00:25:00,831 --> 00:25:03,631
No, no, no. That's okay.
It's uh... That'd be nice.

319
00:25:06,199 --> 00:25:08,599
It's uh... first time
in twenty years

320
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,382
that one of the girls offered.

321
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,900
It's sort of like a sign coming.
Dawning of a new age.

322
00:25:17,031 --> 00:25:18,231
Yeah, well...

323
00:25:18,469 --> 00:25:19,869
I was just kidding.

324
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,490
I'll run it past Fay.

325
00:25:22,014 --> 00:25:23,014
I mean Miss Vaughn.

326
00:25:23,165 --> 00:25:25,165
The head mistress.

327
00:25:25,561 --> 00:25:27,061
I'm sure she'll be okay with that.

328
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:31,075
Hey, what's your name?

329
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:33,558
Well, it's...

330
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:36,830
it's in transition.

331
00:25:37,926 --> 00:25:39,426
In transition?

332
00:25:40,131 --> 00:25:41,231
I like that.

333
00:25:43,103 --> 00:25:43,903
So uh...

334
00:25:44,828 --> 00:25:47,128
how do you spell that?
Is that with a "ph" or an "f"?

335
00:25:51,825 --> 00:25:54,425
You're a... you're a bit
of a thinker, aren't you?

336
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,380
I don't know.

337
00:25:58,918 --> 00:25:59,918
Well, you are.

338
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,590
So, I'll be expecting you...
"in transition."

339
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:06,748
And get yourself some gloves.

340
00:26:14,254 --> 00:26:15,354
So...

341
00:26:19,718 --> 00:26:22,318
She's been planning
this trip to Italy all year.

342
00:26:22,594 --> 00:26:24,594
I just can't call
her up and be like,

343
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:28,198
"Sorry, Mom, trip's off. I'm going
tree planting out west with Paulie."

344
00:26:31,796 --> 00:26:32,796
Tory...

345
00:26:37,356 --> 00:26:39,056
You know what I want to do.

346
00:26:39,847 --> 00:26:41,247
But I can't.

347
00:26:42,627 --> 00:26:45,127
She's been acting really
psycho lately, Paulie...

348
00:26:47,516 --> 00:26:49,216
And I don't know...

349
00:26:50,103 --> 00:26:52,003
I have to spend some time with her.

350
00:26:54,129 --> 00:26:56,929
Besides, you and me will be
together in the fall at McGill.

351
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,060
We will be so together.

352
00:27:04,577 --> 00:27:07,077
I'm going to plant 3000 trees a day.

353
00:27:07,837 --> 00:27:09,837
And win a golden shovel for you.

354
00:28:52,796 --> 00:28:55,396
She gets serious nightmares.

355
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,146
Shall we go easy
today for Mary Brave?

356
00:29:20,976 --> 00:29:22,876
You are gonna love it in here.
It's so cool.

357
00:29:24,811 --> 00:29:25,911
Are you okay?

358
00:29:26,248 --> 00:29:28,248
You should be able to speak easily.

359
00:29:29,507 --> 00:29:31,707
No pain, no gain, Mary Brave.

360
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:35,870
You're doing good for your first
time out. Don't you think, Paulie?

361
00:29:36,217 --> 00:29:37,117
Not bad.

362
00:29:37,654 --> 00:29:39,954
I think we're doing
seven-and-half-minute miles.

363
00:29:40,722 --> 00:29:44,622
No way. Nine at the fastest.
We're dragging our butts, man.

364
00:29:48,198 --> 00:29:50,098
-Oh shit.
-Oh, God.

365
00:29:53,566 --> 00:29:54,966
It's so beautiful.

366
00:29:55,387 --> 00:29:56,487
Don't touch it if you
don't want to get bit.

367
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,130
I wasn't gonna touch it.

368
00:29:58,647 --> 00:30:00,247
Just leave it to me. Okay.

369
00:30:01,522 --> 00:30:02,822
Okay, I'll take care of it.

370
00:30:07,081 --> 00:30:08,581
I said just leave it to me.

371
00:30:08,902 --> 00:30:10,502
I'll meet up with you later. Go.

372
00:30:11,874 --> 00:30:13,874
Come on. When she has
something in her head...

373
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,090
Hey, there.

374
00:30:31,428 --> 00:30:32,228
Hi!

375
00:30:33,441 --> 00:30:36,441
One of you sexy ladies would like
to smoke a split with us?

376
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:39,454
Uh... but thanks.
We're in training so...

377
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,371
Hey, aren't you
Tim Moller's sister?

378
00:30:41,588 --> 00:30:43,888
-Yeah, I'm Tory.
-Hi.

379
00:30:44,081 --> 00:30:45,181
And this is Mary.

380
00:30:45,998 --> 00:30:48,698
Nice to meet you.
I'm Jake Hollander.

381
00:30:49,545 --> 00:30:51,645
And uh, this is John.
And that idiot is Phil.

382
00:30:51,845 --> 00:30:53,345
-Hi.
-Hi.

383
00:31:14,945 --> 00:31:16,245
So anyway um...

384
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,558
-We gotta get going.
-Hey, Tory,

385
00:31:19,067 --> 00:31:21,567
isn't it Tim's 18th coming up?
down at the Bluenote?

386
00:31:21,751 --> 00:31:23,751
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

387
00:31:23,955 --> 00:31:25,955
Sounds like a good time.
You gonna be there?

388
00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:28,885
Um... maybe.

389
00:31:31,624 --> 00:31:32,824
Anyways, we gotta go.

390
00:31:33,062 --> 00:31:34,562
I hope to see you there, Tory.

391
00:31:35,553 --> 00:31:37,453
-"I hope to see you there, Tory."
-Shut up.

392
00:31:39,388 --> 00:31:42,388
-I think he likes you.
-Who?

393
00:31:42,551 --> 00:31:43,851
You know who.

394
00:31:44,755 --> 00:31:46,255
He liked my tits.

395
00:31:46,672 --> 00:31:48,072
They all like my tits.

396
00:31:49,453 --> 00:31:51,453
-So you're gonna go?
-Where?

397
00:31:51,945 --> 00:31:53,945
To your brother's birthday party?

398
00:31:54,341 --> 00:31:57,841
And have all those gross guys
groping me? I'd rather stay home.

399
00:31:58,942 --> 00:32:00,942
I wonder what Paulie's
done with that bird.

400
00:32:02,009 --> 00:32:03,509
Paulie!

401
00:32:05,364 --> 00:32:07,064
Paulie!

402
00:33:04,313 --> 00:33:06,513
Oh, my God!
Is that for the bird?

403
00:33:06,806 --> 00:33:09,806
If they can see too much they get
freaked out. And they go psycho.

404
00:33:13,898 --> 00:33:17,998
-Do you think he's gonna fly again?
-I'm gonna take care of it.

405
00:33:19,938 --> 00:33:22,638
This is gonna be way, way cool.

406
00:33:28,468 --> 00:33:29,468
Come here.

407
00:33:39,683 --> 00:33:42,283
I would so totally
lose it without you, P.

408
00:34:01,825 --> 00:34:03,425
Don't worry.
I'm gonna protect you.

409
00:34:36,716 --> 00:34:39,616
My mother, she really
liked to get her hands dirty.

410
00:34:40,262 --> 00:34:42,762
I'm always afraid
of like... worm eggs.

411
00:34:43,138 --> 00:34:44,338
Worm eggs?

412
00:34:45,247 --> 00:34:46,747
Do worms lay eggs?

413
00:34:47,738 --> 00:34:50,238
I think so.
Or no. I don't know.

414
00:34:52,436 --> 00:34:54,936
I don't think they lay eggs.
I think they just kind of...

415
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,199
ooze up out of the earth.

416
00:34:58,762 --> 00:35:00,762
Your mother,
she sounds pretty interesting.

417
00:35:01,925 --> 00:35:04,025
I like a woman who doesn't
mind getting her hands dirty.

418
00:35:04,225 --> 00:35:07,825
Yeah. She would say, "Hey,
don't worry. It's a clean dirt."

419
00:35:09,306 --> 00:35:11,006
-She was funny.
-Yeah.

420
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:16,040
Every year, in the spring,
she would wake me up in the morning

421
00:35:16,878 --> 00:35:20,278
and she would whisper in my ear
"The first crocus is here."

422
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:24,470
And we would go outside
in our nightgowns and bare feet.

423
00:35:25,504 --> 00:35:27,004
And get your feet dirty. Together.

424
00:38:21,203 --> 00:38:23,403
I don't know if they
didn't know I could hear.

425
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:26,091
Orjust pretended they didn't know.

426
00:38:27,242 --> 00:38:30,442
But after a while,
it was... kind of...

427
00:38:32,131 --> 00:38:33,731
I don't know, okay.

428
00:38:34,814 --> 00:38:37,014
Their sounds, their whispers...

429
00:38:37,978 --> 00:38:40,078
their shadows became kind of..

430
00:38:40,949 --> 00:38:43,849
well, just like part
of my dream or something.

431
00:38:44,975 --> 00:38:46,675
Just the way things were.

432
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,863
It's morning time you lazy...

433
00:38:56,573 --> 00:38:57,673
-Holy fuck!
-Oh, my God!

434
00:39:02,229 --> 00:39:03,629
Bedford, shut the door.

435
00:39:07,405 --> 00:39:10,705
Look your...
your sister gets nightmares.

436
00:39:10,855 --> 00:39:11,855
She's like...

437
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:13,901
She's like screaming in her sleep.

438
00:39:16,894 --> 00:39:17,794
Bedford...

439
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,182
It isn't. It really
isn't what you think.

440
00:39:26,192 --> 00:39:27,192
Get out.

441
00:39:27,629 --> 00:39:30,529
-Get out of my bed.
-Relax. She'll get over it.

442
00:39:31,176 --> 00:39:33,976
You don't know Allison.
Okay, she'll go hysterical.

443
00:39:34,148 --> 00:39:36,048
She's gonna go
straight to Mom and Dad.

444
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,348
So?

445
00:39:37,694 --> 00:39:40,194
Fuck it.
It's the 21st century, right?

446
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,820
No, no.

447
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,050
You don't understand.

448
00:39:46,225 --> 00:39:47,925
You just...
you don't understand.

449
00:39:56,097 --> 00:40:00,197
I swear to God. She crawled into
my bed. I didn't know she was there.

450
00:40:00,411 --> 00:40:01,911
She crawled into your bed?

451
00:40:04,341 --> 00:40:07,841
I think she has a crush on me.
I've told her I'm not like that.

452
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,680
Tory, that's disgusting.

453
00:40:10,955 --> 00:40:13,655
Why don't you tell somebody?
Tell Vaughn. Have her kicked out.

454
00:40:13,926 --> 00:40:15,626
I feel sorry for her.

455
00:40:16,035 --> 00:40:17,435
Being adopted and everything.

456
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,865
Tory, you are too nice.

457
00:40:20,828 --> 00:40:23,328
So, you'll tell
your friends, right?

458
00:40:23,607 --> 00:40:25,107
you'll tell them the truth.
That I'm not like that.

459
00:40:25,237 --> 00:40:26,237
Of course.

460
00:40:26,963 --> 00:40:28,463
I can't believe
I ever thought you were!

461
00:40:29,071 --> 00:40:31,971
And Mom and Dad, you're not
gonna tell them anything, right?

462
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:33,909
No, Tore.

463
00:40:34,631 --> 00:40:35,831
But are you sure you're not...?

464
00:40:36,165 --> 00:40:38,665
Ally! I love guys.

465
00:40:39,135 --> 00:40:41,035
I'm boy-crazy, if anything.

466
00:40:41,724 --> 00:40:45,524
Actually, there's this really cute
guy from RAB I met. Jake.

467
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:47,450
And he is so totally
in love with me.

468
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:49,567
Yeah? You gonna go out with him?

469
00:40:49,775 --> 00:40:53,275
Are you kidding? We're going to
Tim's party together. Friday.

470
00:40:54,088 --> 00:40:55,588
Allison? Come on.

471
00:40:56,677 --> 00:40:57,877
Don't worry, Tore.

472
00:40:58,114 --> 00:40:59,414
I'll straighten everything out.

473
00:42:09,525 --> 00:42:10,625
Hey, Tory.

474
00:42:24,095 --> 00:42:25,795
So, how are you?

475
00:42:27,737 --> 00:42:28,937
Look, first of all,

476
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,479
whatever they are
saying is trashtalk.

477
00:42:31,284 --> 00:42:32,184
Stupid.

478
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:36,239
I know you guys won't listen to it.

479
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,760
Of course not.

480
00:42:38,281 --> 00:42:40,881
But God, I mean, even if it was
true, I'd still be like, "So?

481
00:42:41,828 --> 00:42:42,828
Grow up."

482
00:42:42,978 --> 00:42:44,778
But it's not true.

483
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:46,790
"I mean like my aunt is gay.
Like get over it."

484
00:42:47,003 --> 00:42:49,003
Yeah, but I'm not.
Totally, so...

485
00:42:49,304 --> 00:42:50,604
No, I know.

486
00:42:57,739 --> 00:42:59,139
She's upset.

487
00:43:00,231 --> 00:43:01,531
Give her time.

488
00:43:03,778 --> 00:43:05,878
Bedford, this is a dark day.

489
00:43:11,446 --> 00:43:12,646
""Darkling

490
00:43:13,171 --> 00:43:15,571
stand the varying
shores of the world.

491
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,560
O, Anthony! Anthony! Anthony!"

492
00:43:22,565 --> 00:43:24,565
Ah... Her beloved is dying.

493
00:43:25,345 --> 00:43:26,545
You see?

494
00:43:26,686 --> 00:43:28,886
And so she calls upon the sun

495
00:43:29,562 --> 00:43:31,962
to burn the whole sphere,
the world, in fact. Hm?

496
00:43:33,971 --> 00:43:35,271
Her feeling is,

497
00:43:36,272 --> 00:43:37,672
how can nothing

498
00:43:37,901 --> 00:43:40,801
in nature change when such an
extraordinary shattering...?

499
00:43:41,065 --> 00:43:43,465
Listen to this.
A little later she goes,

500
00:43:43,845 --> 00:43:48,045
"Shall I abide in this dull world
which in thy absence

501
00:43:48,254 --> 00:43:50,154
is no better than a sty?"

502
00:43:51,225 --> 00:43:53,725
Sty. I like that.

503
00:43:54,675 --> 00:43:56,275
And a bit later, she says,

504
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:00,630
"The crown of the earth doth melt.

505
00:44:00,811 --> 00:44:02,111
And there is nothing left

506
00:44:02,248 --> 00:44:04,848
remarkable beneath
the visiting moon."

507
00:44:05,507 --> 00:44:07,007
"Nothing." I know that.

508
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,779
Mm. Yes. Oh, yes.

509
00:44:10,971 --> 00:44:12,771
Eventually we all do, hm?

510
00:44:13,463 --> 00:44:16,763
You see what this is all about is

511
00:44:17,297 --> 00:44:18,397
love.

512
00:44:20,269 --> 00:44:23,369
Mad, passionate love

513
00:44:23,624 --> 00:44:26,224
that crosses all boundaries.

514
00:44:27,074 --> 00:44:28,574
And that's why we

515
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,299
still relate to it today.

516
00:44:31,483 --> 00:44:34,783
Who among us has not felt passion?

517
00:44:34,934 --> 00:44:37,734
I know there are some
who would say that

518
00:44:38,097 --> 00:44:40,597
love is outmoded. Tired.

519
00:44:41,643 --> 00:44:43,243
Well, er... a social construct,

520
00:44:43,465 --> 00:44:44,665
if you like. Hm?

521
00:44:47,683 --> 00:44:50,183
What do you girls think?
Laurie?

522
00:44:51,709 --> 00:44:55,209
When my father left my mother for
his girlfriend, he said it was love.

523
00:44:55,926 --> 00:44:56,826
But it was obvious

524
00:44:57,076 --> 00:44:59,576
to everyone that it was well...

525
00:44:59,952 --> 00:45:00,852
sex.

526
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:03,360
I think love is sex.

527
00:45:04,649 --> 00:45:06,949
I think it's like... projection.

528
00:45:07,428 --> 00:45:09,628
Like a mirage in the desert?

529
00:45:09,824 --> 00:45:11,724
You see what you want
in the person, you know?

530
00:45:12,221 --> 00:45:13,021
No, no, no.

531
00:45:13,275 --> 00:45:15,975
It's a chemical high induced by your
body so you'll want to make babies.

532
00:45:17,013 --> 00:45:17,713
It's money.

533
00:45:18,164 --> 00:45:18,764
Liar!

534
00:45:19,602 --> 00:45:21,602
Liar! Liar!

535
00:45:22,956 --> 00:45:27,856
You've all got your heads up
your assholes, because Love is.

536
00:45:28,036 --> 00:45:29,736
It just is. And nothing
you can say can make it go away

537
00:45:30,049 --> 00:45:32,149
because it is the point
of why we are here.

538
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:33,350
It is the highest point

539
00:45:33,596 --> 00:45:34,896
and once you are up there,

540
00:45:35,034 --> 00:45:37,234
looking down on everyone else...

541
00:45:37,622 --> 00:45:39,122
you're there forever.

542
00:45:39,539 --> 00:45:41,239
Because if you'll move, right?

543
00:45:41,743 --> 00:45:43,043
you'll fall.

544
00:45:44,332 --> 00:45:45,532
you'll fall.

545
00:45:48,262 --> 00:45:49,362
Yes, Paulie.

546
00:45:51,808 --> 00:45:53,908
Hm... I think you may be right.

547
00:45:56,121 --> 00:45:57,321
Listen, Mary,

548
00:45:58,134 --> 00:45:59,934
I have to talk
to you about Paulie...

549
00:46:03,023 --> 00:46:05,623
I know the whole thing must be
really weird for you and I'm sorry.

550
00:46:06,857 --> 00:46:10,557
But, like, you are
the only one that I can really...

551
00:46:13,279 --> 00:46:15,379
Look, you don't know my parents.
Okay.

552
00:46:16,059 --> 00:46:17,559
They are super super straight

553
00:46:17,688 --> 00:46:21,088
and super religious and they would
literally never speak to me again.

554
00:46:22,673 --> 00:46:26,373
And... I need them
to be a part of my life.

555
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:30,141
I couldn't deal with losing them.

556
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:34,533
I mean, I love Paulie.

557
00:46:35,421 --> 00:46:37,021
You know that I do.

558
00:46:38,105 --> 00:46:40,105
She's my best friend in the world

559
00:46:40,309 --> 00:46:43,109
and probably the only person
that I will ever love, like,

560
00:46:43,473 --> 00:46:45,673
like in the way
that Cleopatra loved.

561
00:46:48,553 --> 00:46:50,053
And to hurt her...

562
00:46:52,483 --> 00:46:54,483
feels like I'm choking, you know?

563
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:58,613
Like I'm not in the breathing world.

564
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:03,818
But like there's this life
that I'm supposed to live, okay?

565
00:47:03,985 --> 00:47:07,185
Like this dream my mother
and my father have for me...

566
00:47:07,532 --> 00:47:09,332
and even though
it is killing me,...

567
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:13,170
even if it's killing me, Mary,

568
00:47:14,145 --> 00:47:16,945
I will never be the same
laughing-goofy Tory with her ever.

569
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:21,668
I cannot be with her ever.
Not ever. Ever again.

570
00:47:26,607 --> 00:47:29,107
And the thing is, Mary,
it all depends on you now.

571
00:47:30,824 --> 00:47:31,724
I mean...

572
00:47:33,028 --> 00:47:36,528
Paulie is gonna...
take this very hard.

573
00:47:38,396 --> 00:47:39,696
Okay, she's really sensitive.

574
00:47:40,697 --> 00:47:41,797
And...

575
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:43,830
she's really gonna
need a loyal friend.

576
00:47:44,723 --> 00:47:45,923
She's gonna need you

577
00:47:46,064 --> 00:47:48,064
more than anyone
has ever needed you, Mary.

578
00:47:49,419 --> 00:47:50,419
You think you can handle it?

579
00:47:56,034 --> 00:47:57,934
What are you putting
that shit on for?

580
00:47:58,621 --> 00:47:59,621
Because.

581
00:48:00,443 --> 00:48:01,743
Because why?

582
00:48:02,551 --> 00:48:04,051
Because I'm going out.

583
00:48:04,852 --> 00:48:08,452
-Oh, where you going?
-Just out. With a friend.

584
00:48:08,686 --> 00:48:09,786
What friend?

585
00:48:10,219 --> 00:48:11,919
Just a friend of mine. OK?

586
00:48:12,616 --> 00:48:14,416
I'm just interested
to know, that's all.

587
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:18,092
Well, yeah, friends should
respect each other's privacy.

588
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:21,664
Friends?

589
00:48:23,351 --> 00:48:24,951
Yeah, friends.

590
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,240
We're all friends here,
aren't we, Mary B.?

591
00:48:29,102 --> 00:48:30,702
We're not just friends.

592
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:36,062
I'm sorry, Paulie.

593
00:48:48,561 --> 00:48:49,861
Are you okay?

594
00:48:51,532 --> 00:48:53,632
In her eyes,
that brightness, heh?

595
00:48:54,408 --> 00:48:56,208
Just like my fake mother...

596
00:48:57,763 --> 00:48:59,663
that brightness when she lies...

597
00:49:39,938 --> 00:49:41,838
Make you big and strong.

598
00:49:43,389 --> 00:49:45,289
You can fly far away from here.

599
00:50:00,067 --> 00:50:01,767
You can fly far away from here.

600
00:50:45,693 --> 00:50:47,593
We will fly away from here.

601
00:50:48,952 --> 00:50:51,052
We will away from here forever.

602
00:50:53,553 --> 00:50:54,453
Yeah,

603
00:50:55,087 --> 00:50:57,087
you're gonna fly far away from here.

604
00:51:26,047 --> 00:51:28,247
Until that night, I had never,

605
00:51:29,402 --> 00:51:31,602
never had any feeling
down there at all.

606
00:51:32,565 --> 00:51:33,665
I was...

607
00:51:34,195 --> 00:51:36,795
a kind of wooden doll
without blood in my body.

608
00:51:38,029 --> 00:51:39,329
But that night,

609
00:51:40,617 --> 00:51:44,117
that night, I started
to feel the blood moving.

610
00:52:27,872 --> 00:52:29,172
Did you have a good time?

611
00:52:31,227 --> 00:52:33,027
It's none of
your business, Paulie.

612
00:52:35,253 --> 00:52:36,553
You lied to me.

613
00:52:37,457 --> 00:52:39,757
I said I was going out with
a friend and that's what I did.

614
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,700
Do you always fuck
your friends up against trees?

615
00:52:46,851 --> 00:52:50,751
My life is none of your business.
You have no right to spy on me.

616
00:52:51,069 --> 00:52:55,269
Everything you do is my business.
You are my business and I am yours.

617
00:52:56,053 --> 00:52:58,853
-If you spy on me again...
-What?

618
00:53:00,463 --> 00:53:01,763
Just don't.

619
00:53:06,022 --> 00:53:07,522
Are you gonna see him again?

620
00:53:19,921 --> 00:53:22,621
Listen, Paulie.

621
00:53:24,714 --> 00:53:25,914
It's time we...

622
00:53:26,151 --> 00:53:27,351
we grew out of it.

623
00:53:29,314 --> 00:53:31,114
This is not right anymore.

624
00:53:33,052 --> 00:53:35,052
I just want to be friends, okay?

625
00:53:36,407 --> 00:53:38,207
This is not happening.

626
00:53:41,487 --> 00:53:42,487
Tory...

627
00:53:47,239 --> 00:53:48,739
Baby, please...

628
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:56,682
Would you just please...

629
00:53:56,824 --> 00:53:59,324
-let me go?
-Is this about Allison?

630
00:53:59,699 --> 00:54:02,299
Your parents?
Please?

631
00:54:06,122 --> 00:54:07,322
Don't do this to me.

632
00:56:54,918 --> 00:56:56,218
What is that, Mary?

633
00:56:57,603 --> 00:56:58,703
Oh, just

634
00:56:59,807 --> 00:57:02,107
some seeds.
For, you know, the garden out there.

635
00:57:02,395 --> 00:57:03,295
Seeds?

636
00:57:03,833 --> 00:57:05,933
That's better than
what my mother gets me.

637
00:57:06,325 --> 00:57:08,825
It's like, oh, my God,
her taste is like so Ralph Lauren.

638
00:57:12,843 --> 00:57:14,843
I hope you don't think
I'm like... butting in but...

639
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:20,090
I thought you should know people
are saying like not very nice things

640
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,320
-about you.
-Things?

641
00:57:22,524 --> 00:57:24,024
Oh, because of the way
you're hanging with Paulie.

642
00:57:25,016 --> 00:57:27,716
I guess they think that you're...
you must be like her.

643
00:57:28,563 --> 00:57:30,263
I mean everybody knows that
she practically raped my sister.

644
00:57:31,726 --> 00:57:33,526
Tory said that she crawled
into bed naked with her.

645
00:57:36,135 --> 00:57:37,735
Well, Paulie's my friend.

646
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:40,740
So I guess it doesn't really
matter what other people think.

647
00:57:49,363 --> 00:57:50,663
-Hey!
-Hey.

648
00:57:55,786 --> 00:57:57,886
How much does it matter
what people think?

649
00:57:59,332 --> 00:58:01,432
I don't know. It depends
how you're paid, I guess.

650
00:58:02,975 --> 00:58:04,175
How much they're paying you?

651
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:10,650
My father sent me some seeds.

652
00:58:11,409 --> 00:58:13,809
I was wondering if I could
plant them somewhere.

653
00:58:14,669 --> 00:58:15,569
Well...

654
00:58:16,681 --> 00:58:18,281
in the birch I should
leave you a spot.

655
00:58:21,569 --> 00:58:22,869
Let's see what you got.

656
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:30,830
Whew! Worm eggs!

657
00:58:33,456 --> 00:58:36,756
Jake's hands are magic.
He knows exactly how to touch me.

658
00:58:37,002 --> 00:58:39,002
Teenage boys are so clumsy though.

659
00:58:39,111 --> 00:58:42,211
No. He's so perfect you wouldn't
believe it. He's like...

660
00:58:42,562 --> 00:58:43,662
like a sculptor.

661
00:58:45,054 --> 00:58:47,454
Roger... well Roger is no sculptor.

662
00:58:47,641 --> 00:58:50,441
More like a...
well, kind of like a plumber.

663
00:58:51,764 --> 00:58:52,864
Mine finishes as soon as

664
00:58:53,009 --> 00:58:57,209
-he's inside. The second.
-That's what you get with mating
with a 16 year old...

665
00:58:59,528 --> 00:59:00,528
Jake...

666
00:59:00,869 --> 00:59:01,969
Oh man...

667
00:59:02,116 --> 00:59:05,516
Jake could go all night.
He's a total man.

668
00:59:08,921 --> 00:59:10,421
Yeah, let's go. Come on.

669
00:59:55,314 --> 00:59:57,314
You wouldn't take it
lying down, would you?

670
00:59:57,615 --> 01:00:00,015
If some girl bird
broke up with you?

671
01:00:00,490 --> 01:00:03,690
You wouldn't just lie
there and squawk.

672
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:10,170
You'd fly up to the highest branch
and swoop your lady love back again.

673
01:00:11,322 --> 01:00:12,622
You'd fly her away through the sky.

674
01:00:17,168 --> 01:00:19,268
You wouldn't just lie
there and take it...

675
01:00:21,194 --> 01:00:22,394
like a girl.

676
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,271
Paulie?

677
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:16,455
Pick up a shard.

678
01:01:18,226 --> 01:01:19,826
I said pick up a shard!

679
01:01:41,711 --> 01:01:43,811
Our blood runs together, right?

680
01:01:44,683 --> 01:01:45,983
Blood of the raptor.

681
01:01:49,092 --> 01:01:50,892
Now, cut off my hair.

682
01:01:51,871 --> 01:01:52,571
What for?

683
01:01:56,377 --> 01:01:57,477
Because I'm going to war.

684
01:01:59,252 --> 01:02:01,152
I got nothing to lose now.

685
01:02:01,553 --> 01:02:02,353
Paulie, this is crazy.

686
01:02:03,181 --> 01:02:04,281
Come on.

687
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:12,292
Paulie... is this for Tory?

688
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,579
Just cut off my hair!

689
01:02:17,177 --> 01:02:20,077
She wants a guy.
Not a girl with hacked hair.

690
01:02:20,915 --> 01:02:22,215
What do you know about it?

691
01:02:26,379 --> 01:02:27,479
I'm sorry.

692
01:02:28,679 --> 01:02:30,179
I'm... I'm sorry, okay?

693
01:02:30,979 --> 01:02:33,579
I just...
I just got to get her back.

694
01:02:37,977 --> 01:02:41,177
Paulie, listen to me.
Tory is not a lesbian.

695
01:02:41,427 --> 01:02:43,327
So you should just
forget about her, okay?

696
01:02:44,207 --> 01:02:45,307
Lesbian?

697
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:49,320
Lesbian? Are you fucking kidding me?
You think I'm a lesbian?

698
01:02:50,629 --> 01:02:52,529
You're a girl in love
with a girl, aren't you?

699
01:02:53,409 --> 01:02:58,409
No! I'm Paulie in love with Tory.
Remember?

700
01:02:59,831 --> 01:03:04,531
And Tory is... she is
in love with me. Because

701
01:03:05,007 --> 01:03:08,207
she is mine and I am hers

702
01:03:08,458 --> 01:03:10,358
and neither of us are

703
01:03:10,566 --> 01:03:12,266
lesbians. God!

704
01:03:59,451 --> 01:04:00,951
"I will make me a willow

705
01:04:01,177 --> 01:04:05,177
cabin at your gate. And call
upon my soul within the house.

706
01:04:05,778 --> 01:04:06,978
I will write loyal

707
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:09,219
cantons of condemned love

708
01:04:09,421 --> 01:04:12,921
and sing them loud
even in the dead of night.

709
01:04:13,255 --> 01:04:15,855
I will hallo your name
to the reverberate hills

710
01:04:16,034 --> 01:04:20,634
and make babbling gossip
of the air cry out 'Victoria!"'

711
01:04:21,210 --> 01:04:22,110
Paulie?

712
01:04:25,811 --> 01:04:27,411
Why don't you come down?

713
01:04:37,026 --> 01:04:38,926
Don't ever touch a raptor.

714
01:04:40,285 --> 01:04:41,285
Please.

715
01:05:15,559 --> 01:05:18,759
-I should have seen it come.
-I saw it coming. I told you.

716
01:05:19,010 --> 01:05:20,310
It's still coming.

717
01:06:08,182 --> 01:06:10,782
I bet he doesn't know how
to do what I can do for you.

718
01:06:11,536 --> 01:06:12,736
Paulie, please.

719
01:06:36,842 --> 01:06:38,742
No, Paulie.

720
01:06:40,676 --> 01:06:42,476
There'll be no more of this, okay?

721
01:06:45,852 --> 01:06:47,052
I love Jake.

722
01:06:59,751 --> 01:07:00,751
Paulie,

723
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:05,151
listen to me. I'm going
to say this once and never...

724
01:07:05,789 --> 01:07:07,189
ever again.

725
01:07:12,883 --> 01:07:16,883
I will never love anybody
the way I love you, okay?

726
01:07:19,784 --> 01:07:20,684
Never.

727
01:07:22,085 --> 01:07:23,385
You know that

728
01:07:24,193 --> 01:07:25,493
and I know that.

729
01:07:27,261 --> 01:07:30,261
And I will die knowing that, okay?

730
01:07:33,970 --> 01:07:35,470
It just can never... it

731
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:38,959
just can never ever forever be.

732
01:07:41,159 --> 01:07:42,459
Do you understand?

733
01:07:45,856 --> 01:07:47,056
It just can never...

734
01:07:48,253 --> 01:07:51,153
ever forever be.

735
01:08:35,316 --> 01:08:36,416
Hey, Mary!

736
01:08:40,013 --> 01:08:41,913
So what did you get
on that geography...

737
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:03,980
Go ahead.
Laugh, it's okay.

738
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:06,439
If you want to laugh, laugh.

739
01:09:07,714 --> 01:09:09,014
What's so funny?

740
01:09:13,657 --> 01:09:14,657
I know it.

741
01:09:16,150 --> 01:09:17,650
I'm funny.

742
01:09:19,792 --> 01:09:21,092
Paulie, that's enough.

743
01:09:21,901 --> 01:09:23,501
That's enough, Paulie.

744
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:25,601
Paulie, please.

745
01:09:37,333 --> 01:09:39,833
Your parents are
very worried about you, Paulie.

746
01:09:40,112 --> 01:09:42,112
They say you don't
return their calls.

747
01:09:42,318 --> 01:09:43,918
I have no parents.

748
01:09:48,931 --> 01:09:49,931
I had...

749
01:09:51,136 --> 01:09:53,236
what used to be called
a nervous breakdown once.

750
01:09:55,354 --> 01:09:58,454
When I was a few years
older than you are. And uh...

751
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:02,880
Someone got me help.

752
01:10:04,843 --> 01:10:08,043
And looking back, Paulie,
I am very glad they did.

753
01:10:08,197 --> 01:10:10,097
Because if they hadn't...

754
01:10:10,306 --> 01:10:12,406
Well, I don't know... it was

755
01:10:13,565 --> 01:10:16,465
like I was a car with no driver.

756
01:10:17,495 --> 01:10:20,795
Shall I abide in this dull world

757
01:10:21,618 --> 01:10:25,018
which in her absence
is no better than a sty?

758
01:10:33,503 --> 01:10:34,503
Hey!

759
01:10:38,295 --> 01:10:39,195
How's it going?

760
01:10:40,884 --> 01:10:41,784
Okay.

761
01:10:44,526 --> 01:10:46,226
Kind of weird actually.

762
01:10:46,922 --> 01:10:47,922
What's going on?

763
01:10:50,277 --> 01:10:52,077
You've ever known
somebody who changed?

764
01:10:53,728 --> 01:10:54,828
What kind of change?

765
01:10:56,603 --> 01:10:57,803
Like total.

766
01:10:58,904 --> 01:11:01,304
Like the change from
this to the winter freeze.

767
01:11:02,642 --> 01:11:03,542
Yeah.

768
01:11:04,847 --> 01:11:05,547
Yeah?

769
01:11:06,764 --> 01:11:10,464
Grass comes back every spring green
as ever. I guess people can too.

770
01:11:12,899 --> 01:11:15,099
Some people never
come back, though. Right?

771
01:11:16,158 --> 01:11:17,258
Yeah, some people.

772
01:11:19,896 --> 01:11:20,396
Listen, why don't you...?

773
01:11:20,567 --> 01:11:21,967
I have to go.

774
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:29,160
You will not fall.

775
01:12:09,452 --> 01:12:11,352
""Come, you spirits

776
01:12:11,656 --> 01:12:13,956
that tend on mortal thoughts.

777
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:17,520
Unsex me here!
And

778
01:12:17,886 --> 01:12:21,886
fill me from the crown to the toe

779
01:12:22,009 --> 01:12:24,709
full of the direst cruelty.

780
01:12:25,076 --> 01:12:26,976
Make thick my blood.

781
01:12:27,568 --> 01:12:30,468
Stop up the access
and passage to remorse

782
01:12:31,306 --> 01:12:35,006
that no compunctious visiting
of nature shake my

783
01:12:35,237 --> 01:12:36,537
fell purpose.

784
01:12:37,345 --> 01:12:39,045
Come to my

785
01:12:39,550 --> 01:12:41,550
woman's breasts and

786
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:44,950
take my milk for gall, you

787
01:12:45,205 --> 01:12:46,805
murdering ministers, wherever

788
01:12:47,026 --> 01:12:48,926
in your sightless substances you

789
01:12:49,135 --> 01:12:52,335
wait on nature's mischief!
Come

790
01:12:52,586 --> 01:12:55,086
thick night, and

791
01:12:55,748 --> 01:12:58,048
pall thee in
the dunnest smoke of hell that

792
01:12:58,241 --> 01:13:00,641
my keen knife see

793
01:13:00,829 --> 01:13:03,129
not the wound it makes,

794
01:13:03,322 --> 01:13:04,522
nor Heaven

795
01:13:04,759 --> 01:13:06,759
peep through the blanket
of the dark to cry,

796
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:08,160
'Hold, hold!"'

797
01:13:11,373 --> 01:13:13,373
Now, does anyone know

798
01:13:13,577 --> 01:13:16,177
what our friend Lady M. is on about?

799
01:13:17,028 --> 01:13:18,028
Cordelia?

800
01:13:23,833 --> 01:13:24,833
Vampires?

801
01:13:27,092 --> 01:13:29,192
Oh well, I've never
heard that interpretation.

802
01:13:29,393 --> 01:13:30,393
Oh, but that doesn't mean

803
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:33,739
it's invalid, Cordelia.
Tell us more.

804
01:13:33,994 --> 01:13:36,494
Well, just... all the blood?

805
01:13:37,541 --> 01:13:38,541
Okay.

806
01:13:38,691 --> 01:13:41,691
Thinking about our lunch,
were we, Cordelia? Hm, again?

807
01:13:42,237 --> 01:13:42,837
Ah, Paulie?

808
01:13:44,058 --> 01:13:45,558
You looked like you
were involved with the piece.

809
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:50,530
I was just thinking whether the Jays
would take the World Series again.

810
01:13:52,781 --> 01:13:55,681
I don't believe you, Paulie.
I saw you listening.

811
01:13:58,532 --> 01:14:00,532
You can go fuck yourself sideways.

812
01:14:13,965 --> 01:14:15,265
Paulie is going through

813
01:14:15,498 --> 01:14:17,098
a difficult time. Mm?

814
01:14:18,278 --> 01:14:20,578
Now, shall I offer up

815
01:14:20,771 --> 01:14:22,471
my interpretation?

816
01:14:22,688 --> 01:14:24,188
I think that Lady Macbeth...

817
01:14:24,413 --> 01:14:26,113
She wants to get up the guts.

818
01:14:27,767 --> 01:14:28,967
Yes, Mary.

819
01:14:30,643 --> 01:14:32,343
To do what she has to do.

820
01:14:33,902 --> 01:14:34,902
Only the girl

821
01:14:35,148 --> 01:14:36,948
part of her doesn't have the guts.

822
01:14:37,161 --> 01:14:39,161
So she says,
"Turn my milk to gall"

823
01:14:39,654 --> 01:14:41,054
and I think gall is poison.

824
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:45,579
But then what
would happen to the baby?

825
01:14:45,979 --> 01:14:47,479
The baby would die.

826
01:14:49,143 --> 01:14:51,343
And she wants
not to care about that.

827
01:14:52,210 --> 01:14:54,910
She wants not to care,
to be like a guy,

828
01:14:55,373 --> 01:14:56,373
like a man.

829
01:14:57,962 --> 01:14:59,062
Men don't care, see?

830
01:15:01,028 --> 01:15:03,928
I liked what you said about the
Shakespeare. That scary speech.

831
01:15:04,192 --> 01:15:07,192
-You did?
-I wish I could be "unsexed"

832
01:15:07,355 --> 01:15:10,855
or whatever. I mean like it all just
causes so much trouble, you know?

833
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:18,520
Ah, so see you later.

834
01:15:30,264 --> 01:15:31,264
Read it.

835
01:15:33,811 --> 01:15:35,811
-Out loud?
-Yeah. Right now.

836
01:15:46,175 --> 01:15:47,875
"Dear Miss Oster,

837
01:15:48,188 --> 01:15:51,088
After much difficulty, we have
located your birth mother but we are

838
01:15:51,735 --> 01:15:56,035
sorry to inform you that she does
not wish to be contacted by you..."

839
01:16:01,224 --> 01:16:02,824
Do you want me to keep reading?

840
01:16:16,465 --> 01:16:18,965
-Sorry, Paulie.
-Know what? She has a life.

841
01:16:21,641 --> 01:16:24,141
She has a right
to a fucking life, Mouse.

842
01:16:50,396 --> 01:16:52,296
You should have got
out of my way, man.

843
01:16:53,368 --> 01:16:55,468
I have been looking
everywhere for you.

844
01:16:55,764 --> 01:16:59,064
I'm sorry I said
"go fuck yourself" in class there.

845
01:16:59,503 --> 01:17:01,703
I was way out of line.
You can give me a detention.

846
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:05,400
Give me two.

847
01:17:06,309 --> 01:17:08,909
I know someone, Paulie.
A friend

848
01:17:09,184 --> 01:17:10,684
of mine who could really help you.

849
01:17:10,813 --> 01:17:11,513
Help me what?

850
01:17:12,443 --> 01:17:13,443
Help you deal...

851
01:17:14,935 --> 01:17:19,535
I think people who lie to themselves
need help, Fay. Don't you?

852
01:17:19,728 --> 01:17:21,328
Oh, believe me, please.

853
01:17:21,932 --> 01:17:23,032
I know what you're going through.

854
01:17:23,370 --> 01:17:24,470
No, you don't.

855
01:17:25,575 --> 01:17:26,875
Love can be...

856
01:17:27,875 --> 01:17:30,075
a very painful experience.
I know.

857
01:17:30,272 --> 01:17:31,872
You don't know anything.

858
01:17:32,764 --> 01:17:35,864
Yes, Paulie. I think I know.

859
01:17:45,321 --> 01:17:47,821
She's the only person
who ever loved me, you know?

860
01:17:51,264 --> 01:17:52,964
I think I'll die without her.

861
01:18:05,833 --> 01:18:06,933
Hey, kid!

862
01:18:10,721 --> 01:18:14,221
-You know Jake Hollander?
-Yeah, I know him.

863
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:16,460
Alright, give this to him
or I'll kick your butt.

864
01:18:22,607 --> 01:18:24,907
""Jake, you butthole.

865
01:18:25,579 --> 01:18:28,679
Saturday noon.
Dark noon foryou.

866
01:18:29,317 --> 01:18:30,817
Eastside Ravine.

867
01:18:31,138 --> 01:18:34,438
Duel to the death for the heart
of my queen, Victoria.

868
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:38,160
Yours truly,
Paulie, the Raptor. ""

869
01:18:38,902 --> 01:18:41,502
No, the dinner's at six,
the tour is at five...

870
01:18:43,215 --> 01:18:44,315
Well, okay.

871
01:18:44,558 --> 01:18:48,158
Be here for the dinner. I don't want
to be the only one without a father.

872
01:18:50,692 --> 01:18:53,092
I don't know...
Chicken Kiev, lobster,

873
01:18:53,281 --> 01:18:54,881
everything, it's a buffet.

874
01:18:56,251 --> 01:18:59,251
Okay, so I'll see you on Friday.
Six o'clock sharp.

875
01:19:02,674 --> 01:19:04,274
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

876
01:19:05,262 --> 01:19:06,362
Just...

877
01:19:08,521 --> 01:19:10,021
Maybe. I'll tell you
when I see you.

878
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:12,880
Okay.

879
01:19:13,217 --> 01:19:14,117
Yeah.

880
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:16,743
Love you. Bye.

881
01:19:25,774 --> 01:19:26,574
She's fucking fried, man.

882
01:19:27,404 --> 01:19:30,304
I think she sounds really unstable.
I don't think it's such a good idea.

883
01:19:31,334 --> 01:19:33,034
She's making Tory's life hell.

884
01:19:33,155 --> 01:19:35,755
-Why doesn't Tory just cut off?
-She's too nice.

885
01:19:36,126 --> 01:19:38,026
-That's who she is.
-Come on, man.

886
01:19:38,427 --> 01:19:41,027
Do it for Tory.
Do it for your woman.

887
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:44,570
Why not?
A duel sounds like fun.

888
01:20:27,791 --> 01:20:30,191
He's never been on time
for anything in his life.

889
01:20:30,859 --> 01:20:33,759
He could be caught in traffic.
It gets really bad coming here.

890
01:20:34,309 --> 01:20:35,209
Yeah, for sure.

891
01:20:35,843 --> 01:20:38,043
Hello, Miss Bannet.
How are you?

892
01:20:38,335 --> 01:20:39,635
-Fine.
-Good.

893
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:41,568
-What a wonderful party...
-Hey, hold on.

894
01:20:43,128 --> 01:20:45,228
Are you well? Yes? Good.

895
01:20:45,619 --> 01:20:47,519
-Oh, it's you.
-Miss Vaughn...

896
01:21:00,668 --> 01:21:03,368
-I wanna dance.
-Well, let's go then.

897
01:22:10,738 --> 01:22:11,938
Good evening, Victoria.

898
01:22:13,229 --> 01:22:14,129
Hello, Bruce.

899
01:22:14,284 --> 01:22:15,284
Good evening.

900
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:17,230
Bruce, I wonder if I might cut in.

901
01:22:18,406 --> 01:22:20,206
This is a joke, right, Victoria?

902
01:22:20,610 --> 01:22:21,510
Joke?

903
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:24,340
I'm asking you. Nicely.

904
01:22:25,882 --> 01:22:27,882
Can I dance
with your daughter, please?

905
01:22:28,566 --> 01:22:31,566
I'm afraid I don't think that's
appropriate or Victoria either.

906
01:22:36,138 --> 01:22:37,438
Are you crazy?

907
01:22:38,055 --> 01:22:39,855
What, don't you like dancing?

908
01:22:40,068 --> 01:22:42,368
You used to love to dance
with me on the roof. Remember?

909
01:22:42,561 --> 01:22:44,761
-Paulie, please.
-What?

910
01:22:45,244 --> 01:22:47,144
Don't make this difficult.

911
01:22:48,504 --> 01:22:50,004
You love me, Tory.

912
01:22:50,708 --> 01:22:51,808
Like a friend.

913
01:22:54,829 --> 01:22:56,429
As a lover.

914
01:22:57,322 --> 01:22:58,222
Say it.

915
01:23:00,868 --> 01:23:03,268
"I'm in love with you, Paulie."
Say it or I'll stop

916
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:06,452
-this dance right now and...
-Paulie, please, please.

917
01:23:06,619 --> 01:23:07,919
Then say it!

918
01:23:09,974 --> 01:23:10,874
Say it.

919
01:23:18,218 --> 01:23:18,918
No.

920
01:23:19,751 --> 01:23:21,651
You tell anybody
whatever you want.

921
01:23:51,766 --> 01:23:52,766
Paulie.

922
01:23:53,012 --> 01:23:56,912
Paulie, come here.
Paulie, Paulie. Paulie...

923
01:24:01,639 --> 01:24:02,439
Fay.

924
01:24:40,843 --> 01:24:41,943
Mary Brave.

925
01:24:44,965 --> 01:24:45,865
Let's go.

926
01:24:56,563 --> 01:24:58,663
Have you ever been really thirsty?

927
01:24:58,863 --> 01:25:02,063
You open a carton ofmilk
and you pour it into your mouth.

928
01:25:03,369 --> 01:25:04,469
And it's...

929
01:25:05,190 --> 01:25:06,290
sour?

930
01:25:08,065 --> 01:25:10,465
That happened inside me...

931
01:25:10,653 --> 01:25:11,853
I'm so tired.

932
01:25:12,378 --> 01:25:13,278
...forever.

933
01:25:19,951 --> 01:25:21,851
I've never been so tired.

934
01:25:35,671 --> 01:25:37,171
He can fly.

935
01:25:37,876 --> 01:25:40,076
Hey, you taught him to fly?

936
01:25:41,135 --> 01:25:43,135
He's gonna show us
the way, Mary B.

937
01:25:44,393 --> 01:25:45,493
The way?

938
01:25:46,310 --> 01:25:48,310
Mouse, where is your father?

939
01:25:50,144 --> 01:25:51,844
Did I see you cry?

940
01:25:52,158 --> 01:25:56,058
Were you crying like a girl?
Like a girly, girly, girl?

941
01:26:07,303 --> 01:26:09,403
I've been crying too, Mary B.

942
01:26:11,233 --> 01:26:13,333
I've been crying
like a girly girl,

943
01:26:13,533 --> 01:26:16,333
sucky suck for weeks
now and it's time.

944
01:26:16,601 --> 01:26:18,801
It's time for the raptor.
Are you with me?

945
01:26:20,722 --> 01:26:22,722
I hate my father.

946
01:26:24,939 --> 01:26:29,439
Say it. It's easy. Come on.
"I hate my father."

947
01:26:35,579 --> 01:26:36,879
I hate...

948
01:26:38,838 --> 01:26:40,038
my father...

949
01:26:42,097 --> 01:26:42,997
Yeah.

950
01:26:43,535 --> 01:26:44,935
Give me more.

951
01:26:45,835 --> 01:26:48,635
I wish we were dead.
I hate him.

952
01:26:48,807 --> 01:26:52,107
I hate my stupid fucking
asshole-fucking father!

953
01:26:52,354 --> 01:26:53,654
I hate him!

954
01:26:53,887 --> 01:26:57,387
"Unsex me here
and take my milk for gall.

955
01:26:57,721 --> 01:27:01,221
Fill me from crown to toe
top full with direst cruelty..."

956
01:27:01,459 --> 01:27:04,259
Come on, say that.
Say it to the raptor. Come on.

957
01:27:05,293 --> 01:27:06,593
"Unsex me...

958
01:27:07,977 --> 01:27:11,277
unsex me here,
take my milk for gall..."

959
01:27:11,907 --> 01:27:14,707
"Make thick my blood."

960
01:27:15,358 --> 01:27:16,858
"Make thick my blood."

961
01:27:17,946 --> 01:27:19,346
Feed the raptor.

962
01:27:20,630 --> 01:27:23,030
-I can't.
-Oh yes, you can.

963
01:27:32,995 --> 01:27:35,995
"Fill me from crown
to toe top full

964
01:27:36,254 --> 01:27:38,054
with the direst cruelty."

965
01:27:38,458 --> 01:27:41,058
Come on. Say that
and feed the beast.

966
01:27:47,469 --> 01:27:50,669
"Fill me full from crown to toe top

967
01:27:51,303 --> 01:27:54,103
full with direst cruelty."

968
01:28:03,284 --> 01:28:04,884
Are you ready, Mary B.?

969
01:28:06,927 --> 01:28:08,827
You're ready for dark noon?

970
01:28:11,911 --> 01:28:13,211
I'm ready.

971
01:28:14,595 --> 01:28:16,195
Are you ready for anything?

972
01:28:18,621 --> 01:28:20,021
Rage more.

973
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:25,660
Come on.

974
01:29:50,831 --> 01:29:52,131
She's ready!

975
01:29:53,036 --> 01:29:54,536
What the fuck is that?

976
01:29:54,858 --> 01:29:56,158
It's her pet budgie.

977
01:29:56,679 --> 01:29:58,479
-It's not a pet.
-Oh, no?

978
01:29:59,075 --> 01:30:00,075
It's a killer.

979
01:30:03,867 --> 01:30:05,367
Well, I came, Paulie.

980
01:30:05,784 --> 01:30:06,784
So what do you want to do?

981
01:30:07,031 --> 01:30:08,531
You want to fight me?

982
01:30:09,043 --> 01:30:10,343
You and your bird?

983
01:30:12,207 --> 01:30:14,307
I gotta warn you,
I'm on the wrestling team.

984
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:23,750
Oh! Oh, I get it.

985
01:30:24,092 --> 01:30:25,592
Yeah, like a stage fight.

986
01:30:25,722 --> 01:30:28,222
We're gonna have a stage fight?
Oh, cool.

987
01:30:28,885 --> 01:30:32,385
Yeah, I played Laertes
in Hamlet last term.

988
01:30:34,157 --> 01:30:35,357
I'm gonna have fun doing this.

989
01:30:35,882 --> 01:30:36,882
Come on, Jake.

990
01:30:49,014 --> 01:30:50,014
Come on, Paulie.

991
01:30:52,465 --> 01:30:53,065
Come on, man.

992
01:30:56,490 --> 01:30:57,290
Be careful!

993
01:31:02,530 --> 01:31:04,130
Place your bets, my friends.

994
01:31:04,926 --> 01:31:05,826
For my love.

995
01:31:06,843 --> 01:31:08,543
Look, if you're talking
about Tory, get real.

996
01:31:08,856 --> 01:31:10,956
She hates you.
She's just too nice to tell you.

997
01:31:11,156 --> 01:31:13,256
-She loves me.
-Stop talking shit, Paulie.

998
01:31:13,649 --> 01:31:14,749
Victoria's my girlfriend.

999
01:31:19,112 --> 01:31:19,712
Watch out!

1000
01:31:20,837 --> 01:31:22,037
-Come on!
-Paulie, watch out!

1001
01:31:27,643 --> 01:31:28,143
Give her up!

1002
01:31:28,409 --> 01:31:29,109
Paulie!

1003
01:31:29,464 --> 01:31:30,264
Say it!

1004
01:31:30,615 --> 01:31:31,915
Say...

1005
01:31:32,148 --> 01:31:32,948
"I give her up."

1006
01:31:34,161 --> 01:31:35,461
Go fuck yourself.

1007
01:31:41,541 --> 01:31:42,141
Paulie, no!

1008
01:31:44,992 --> 01:31:46,692
-Fucking bitch!
-Paulie!

1009
01:31:47,388 --> 01:31:49,688
-She cut...!
-You fucking bitch!

1010
01:31:49,977 --> 01:31:52,577
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1011
01:31:53,043 --> 01:31:54,343
You are fucking crazy!

1012
01:32:42,408 --> 01:32:43,508
Paulie!

1013
01:32:46,913 --> 01:32:47,913
Paulie.

1014
01:32:50,651 --> 01:32:51,651
Please.

1015
01:32:56,977 --> 01:32:59,477
"I will make me
a willow cabin at your gate,

1016
01:33:01,196 --> 01:33:04,096
and call upon my soul
within the house."

1017
01:33:08,385 --> 01:33:10,685
I rush into the secret house...

1018
01:33:14,902 --> 01:33:15,902
Paulie!

1019
01:33:50,368 --> 01:33:51,768
Dear my Mother,

1020
01:33:53,339 --> 01:33:55,339
I almost got lost too, didn't l?

1021
01:33:56,790 --> 01:33:59,290
But the pure love
you gave me till you died

1022
01:33:59,953 --> 01:34:02,753
was like a flame
always there, burning.

1023
01:34:04,171 --> 01:34:05,971
Andjust like the raptor

1024
01:34:06,568 --> 01:34:09,868
that little flame was all I needed
in order to see in the dark.

1025
01:34:11,647 --> 01:34:13,147
It saved me, mama.

1026
01:34:13,756 --> 01:34:15,456
From the deep dark.

1027
01:34:17,398 --> 01:34:19,698
Paulie, she didn't have that.

1028
01:34:20,370 --> 01:34:23,670
The darkness took over her
so she had to fly away.

1029
01:34:25,546 --> 01:34:27,746
I still dream of her.
Every night.

1030
01:34:29,380 --> 01:34:31,080
And I think I always will.

1031
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:33,839
And you know?

1032
01:34:34,747 --> 01:34:36,847
I can always
remember your face now.

1033
01:34:38,198 --> 01:34:41,598
Anytime I think of you,
I look up and I can see your face,

1034
01:34:42,321 --> 01:34:43,721
my mother's face,

1035
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:47,200
like a flame, across the sky.
