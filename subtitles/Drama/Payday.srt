1
00:01:20,542 --> 00:01:21,583
Get photo?

2
00:01:21,584 --> 00:01:23,667
Yes, please

3
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,001
No problem

4
00:03:00,376 --> 00:03:02,001
Excuse me, takeaway?

5
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:04,042
Who ordered takeaway?

6
00:03:04,501 --> 00:03:06,208
Brother Cheong, you ordered

7
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:06,709
Me?

8
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,542
Oh, yes!

9
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:09,167
It has been too long that I almost forgot

10
00:03:09,334 --> 00:03:11,042
I am sorry, I couldn't get a bus

11
00:03:11,376 --> 00:03:13,084
Whatever, here

12
00:03:14,251 --> 00:03:16,334
$283, please

13
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:25,751
What the hell is that?
The noodle gets fatter?

14
00:03:26,251 --> 00:03:27,667
Got radiated?

15
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,041
Well... it got bigger...

16
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:32,667
then can be shared with more people?

17
00:03:34,834 --> 00:03:42,834
Right, then let's share your lollipop

18
00:03:44,042 --> 00:03:47,209
Hey, don't make trouble at my place!

19
00:03:48,376 --> 00:03:51,625
Yes... boss... Go to hell!

20
00:03:51,626 --> 00:03:52,333
Hey!

21
00:03:52,334 --> 00:03:53,375
What? It's not your business

22
00:03:53,376 --> 00:03:55,166
You son of a bitch!

23
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:57,667
Why your boss hasn't shown up yet?

24
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:01,042
Asshole, call him now!

25
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:05,334
Call him!

26
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:07,584
I told you to call your boss!

27
00:04:17,042 --> 00:04:20,334
What? Stay there! You wanna get beaten?

28
00:04:47,584 --> 00:04:49,959
That's enough, you are gonna kill him

29
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,209
You are nothing to me

30
00:05:03,626 --> 00:05:06,459
What's happened? Why so noisy?

31
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:15,251
Why so drunk

32
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:19,751
Brother Ghost! It's so
hard to get you in touch

33
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:22,084
Come on, let's have a chat

34
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:23,708
What you guys are staring?

35
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:25,041
Is it an entertainment show?

36
00:05:25,042 --> 00:05:27,042
Move this jerk aside

37
00:05:28,417 --> 00:05:30,292
Quick, clear things up

38
00:05:44,251 --> 00:05:45,334
You'd better leave first

39
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:49,459
I haven't got my money

40
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,751
I'll get it for you. I'll give you tomorrow

41
00:05:54,001 --> 00:05:55,167
$283

42
00:05:57,292 --> 00:05:58,376
Thank You

43
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:27,292
Ghost, I want to do some business with you

44
00:06:29,084 --> 00:06:30,364
What business I can do with you?

45
00:06:31,751 --> 00:06:33,584
This location is great

46
00:06:34,001 --> 00:06:35,667
I can get you more customers

47
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:38,416
Girls are not a problem

48
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:40,708
I've already got the coke and K

49
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:42,626
What you have to do is
to provide this place,

50
00:06:42,917 --> 00:06:45,083
you and I are going to make some money

51
00:06:45,084 --> 00:06:47,084
We share what we earn

52
00:06:51,584 --> 00:06:53,751
I know you don't like this stuff,

53
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:57,042
how about this, sell me the place

54
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,041
Give me a number,

55
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,501
I will absolutely fulfill
you, how about that?

56
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:07,208
Those real estate guys,

57
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:09,667
they've almost bought the entire Hong Kong

58
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:13,709
why don't they leave some space
for people to sing?

59
00:07:14,376 --> 00:07:17,791
Bill, you have made so much money
all these years

60
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:21,292
it's time for you to do some good

61
00:07:26,417 --> 00:07:27,751
one more thing,

62
00:07:28,042 --> 00:07:30,209
don't you ever to cause trouble
at my place again

63
00:07:49,876 --> 00:07:53,001
Uncle Two, Brother B, Boss!

64
00:07:53,501 --> 00:07:55,626
Leung, are you alright?

65
00:07:55,917 --> 00:07:58,042
I am fine, just a dozen stitches

66
00:07:58,542 --> 00:07:59,583
Damn it

67
00:07:59,584 --> 00:08:02,541
A dozen stitches? Cheong that asshole,

68
00:08:02,542 --> 00:08:03,958
If I didn't hurt my hand,

69
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,208
I am gonna make him to pay back

70
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:06,751
Yeah right

71
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:09,917
Don't make fun of me Boss

72
00:08:10,001 --> 00:08:11,166
Brother B,

73
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:12,875
Everyone Knows you can fight
against 8 people at a time

74
00:08:12,876 --> 00:08:14,458
You are the toughest among Hung Hing

75
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:15,791
Of course I am!

76
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:17,001
30 years ago?

77
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,709
Don't make fun of me ok?

78
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,751
Anyway, be careful when you take shower

79
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:26,792
Uggh, uggh... Ouch, ouch...

80
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,251
Boss, what Bill talked with you?

81
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:35,625
What thing can we talk?
He just wants my Karaoke

82
00:08:35,626 --> 00:08:37,946
He has talked with me for a lot of times,
I am done with it

83
00:08:38,542 --> 00:08:40,001
But anyway,

84
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:42,500
we really need to think about it seriously,

85
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:43,626
any other business,

86
00:08:44,084 --> 00:08:46,917
Karaoke is out, tough to do

87
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:50,584
Last time we talked
about running a coffin shop,

88
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:52,250
why no follow up?

89
00:08:52,251 --> 00:08:55,042
Not no follow up, we already checked,

90
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:59,125
The source of coffins
is controlled by 2 families,

91
00:08:59,126 --> 00:09:00,334
it's difficult to get supply

92
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:03,584
Hong Kong style teahouse?

93
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:07,583
Hong Kong style teahouse?
Ask B, he ran one before

94
00:09:07,584 --> 00:09:08,583
It's been ages,

95
00:09:08,584 --> 00:09:10,291
teahouses are much more
than grocery stores now

96
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:11,458
It won't work

97
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:13,246
But recently even a Hong
Kong style teahouse

98
00:09:13,272 --> 00:09:14,859
plans to get listed
on the Stock Market

99
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:18,542
Keep thinking, keep thinking,
let's do some research

100
00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:20,042
Think... think...

101
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:22,417
Think again?

102
00:09:22,751 --> 00:09:25,375
Any suggestion else? Any sure win plan?

103
00:09:25,376 --> 00:09:28,833
What if we lose money? How do we explain?

104
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:29,667
Brother Ghost!

105
00:09:31,001 --> 00:09:33,333
Damn it, why she knows I am here?

106
00:09:33,334 --> 00:09:34,251
Damn!

107
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:37,542
Who said that you are not here?

108
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:42,916
Who said that you are not here?

109
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:44,125
It's so difficult to find you

110
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:45,875
Oh, you got tired to find me?

111
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,083
Yes!

112
00:09:47,084 --> 00:09:48,958
How about having someone
to give you a massage?

113
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,375
Good idea, you!

114
00:09:50,376 --> 00:09:52,751
Where?

115
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:22,167
Is it ok?

116
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:24,666
Yes, that's right

117
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:25,458
Do you know?

118
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,499
Japanese ramen restaurant
is very popular these days

119
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:29,333
That one in Causeway Bay,

120
00:10:29,334 --> 00:10:31,375
people queue up day and night

121
00:10:31,376 --> 00:10:32,791
I have an idea,

122
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:36,042
let's also sell yoghurt
and pearl milk tea here

123
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:37,125
Little Girl

124
00:10:37,126 --> 00:10:39,250
We only have <i>2</i> chefs,

125
00:10:39,251 --> 00:10:40,917
they are already very busy

126
00:10:41,126 --> 00:10:42,875
and you want them to do more things?

127
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,416
Do you think they can handle it?

128
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:46,251
They have to...

129
00:10:46,376 --> 00:10:48,041
You sound like your father

130
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:48,959
We have to...

131
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,583
Uncle Kwan, here you go

132
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,001
OK, thank you

133
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:56,000
Come! Take it to your father
before it gets cold

134
00:10:56,001 --> 00:10:57,251
<i>OK</i>

135
00:10:58,542 --> 00:10:59,916
Hey, what are you doing?

136
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:02,958
I am making an "instant soup pack"

137
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,279
So my father can have hot soup anytime
even in the hospital

138
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:07,583
Hey, why don't you have a taste?

139
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,791
No, have your father taste it, go!

140
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:10,750
Fine

141
00:11:10,751 --> 00:11:12,541
Ok, ok, don't you touch my stuff!

142
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:13,822
Ok, ok, I won't touch your stuff

143
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:19,376
Hi!

144
00:11:20,292 --> 00:11:21,709
Your money

145
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:24,917
I didn't expect that you are accountable

146
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:26,626
How's your head?

147
00:11:27,084 --> 00:11:28,042
I am fine

148
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:31,250
Want to eat?

149
00:11:31,251 --> 00:11:32,166
Sure

150
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:33,542
Have a seat

151
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,167
What do you want to eat?

152
00:11:36,334 --> 00:11:37,750
How about macaroni soup
with a fried egg and ham?

153
00:11:37,751 --> 00:11:39,291
Add $1 to change to toast?

154
00:11:39,292 --> 00:11:40,791
- Ok
- What do you want to drink?

155
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:41,459
Iced milk tea

156
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:43,708
Uncle Kwan, Meal A with iced milk tea!

157
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:44,750
COPY

158
00:11:44,751 --> 00:11:46,916
Hey, your father is waiting, get going!

159
00:11:46,917 --> 00:11:48,042
Yes, yes

160
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:49,709
I got to go first

161
00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:00,667
Hey, your phone! Quick, quick, quick...

162
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:03,416
Password?

163
00:12:03,417 --> 00:12:04,667
3581

164
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:10,791
don't show your password
to others that easily next time

165
00:12:10,792 --> 00:12:11,834
Bye-bye

166
00:12:17,542 --> 00:12:20,459
Sorry that I forgot to thank you
for saving my life

167
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,666
I am going to the hospital
to visit my father,

168
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:24,209
he is very sick

169
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:27,542
Bless your dad

170
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:32,167
I am Mei

171
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:35,916
What? Our place got messed up?

172
00:12:35,917 --> 00:12:38,277
Yes! They mix grasshoppers with shit
and threw into our shop

173
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:39,209
ls Boss with you?

174
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:43,250
No, He said he has a place
to go this morning,

175
00:12:43,251 --> 00:12:44,542
Ok, I Will find him

176
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:46,583
Hey, clean up the place

177
00:12:46,584 --> 00:12:47,541
Yes, I will

178
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:48,876
OK, I go find him now

179
00:12:57,626 --> 00:13:01,292
Boss, why didn't you answer your phone?

180
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:05,334
Our Karaoke got messed up by someone

181
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:06,459
Who did it?

182
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:07,501
Still checking...

183
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:19,917
Boss, are you alright?

184
00:13:24,876 --> 00:13:26,751
My mother wouldn't see me

185
00:13:29,584 --> 00:13:31,625
she has been in nursing
home for many years,

186
00:13:31,626 --> 00:13:33,876
she refuses to see me
every time I go visit her

187
00:13:36,834 --> 00:13:40,042
Boss, it has been so long,

188
00:13:40,542 --> 00:13:42,708
it's not that you don't go visiting her,

189
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:44,334
it's she doesn't want to see you

190
00:13:50,501 --> 00:13:53,292
when I was a kid,

191
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:59,126
the environment was tough,
we had no food, no toys,

192
00:13:59,834 --> 00:14:05,417
the best way-out is either be a policeman
or to be a thug

193
00:14:06,626 --> 00:14:08,208
I was just in time,

194
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:10,126
couldn't say if I am lucky or not,

195
00:14:10,334 --> 00:14:13,084
that I didn't have a
chance to do bad things

196
00:14:15,501 --> 00:14:17,458
now we are old,

197
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:19,709
Hung Hing is collapsing,

198
00:14:20,417 --> 00:14:22,667
My mother still doesn't want to see me,

199
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:29,251
Boss, I'll go visit her tomorrow,

200
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:31,876
I'll buy her some good food

201
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,376
anything you want to say to her,

202
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:36,209
I'll tell her for you

203
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,917
she always talks about you

204
00:14:39,501 --> 00:14:41,292
No, she is gone

205
00:15:09,626 --> 00:15:13,251
don't worry, we have
worked here for so long,

206
00:15:13,584 --> 00:15:15,792
you have our full support

207
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:19,000
we are going to hang in here...

208
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:23,167
until you decide to quit,
to sell it No worries

209
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:26,876
Uncle Kwan, I know you love me,

210
00:15:28,334 --> 00:15:30,791
but what about you guys?

211
00:15:30,792 --> 00:15:32,875
If I couldn't hang in anymore
and sell the shop?

212
00:15:32,876 --> 00:15:34,791
Don't say things like this

213
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:37,458
Be confident, especially at this moment

214
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:39,291
We will be with you even we don't get paid

215
00:15:39,292 --> 00:15:40,126
Everyone agrees?

216
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:41,750
You have the final say?

217
00:15:41,751 --> 00:15:43,459
You don't stand for us,

218
00:15:43,626 --> 00:15:45,666
we are the main support in our families

219
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:48,959
Yes, we are old, who will hire us?

220
00:15:49,417 --> 00:15:50,291
If no one hires you?

221
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:52,208
Then go back to your home village
and grow something

222
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:53,708
I don't have any farm
land in my home village,

223
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:54,791
so where can I grow?

224
00:15:54,792 --> 00:15:55,792
Grow in your field?

225
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:58,291
Hey, you don't have to say that

226
00:15:58,292 --> 00:15:59,333
So what?

227
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:05,001
Stop it, I didn't say that I will quit

228
00:16:36,584 --> 00:16:40,292
Ghost, did you hear what the priest said?

229
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:43,333
He said believe in God
will get an eternal life

230
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:45,000
Your mother believed in God,

231
00:16:45,001 --> 00:16:46,459
which means she didn't die

232
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:48,708
So don't be sad, right?

233
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:49,708
Then Brother Two,

234
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:51,333
you'd better hurry up to believe in God too

235
00:16:51,334 --> 00:16:52,094
Are you cursing me?

236
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:54,041
No, as you are terrified by death,

237
00:16:54,042 --> 00:16:55,584
believe in God as quick as possible,

238
00:16:56,126 --> 00:16:57,334
then you will not die

239
00:16:57,501 --> 00:16:59,001
Jerk!

240
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:03,666
Don't curse me, God forgives people

241
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:04,541
That's true,

242
00:17:04,542 --> 00:17:07,250
but his mother is the one
who believed in God, not me

243
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:08,583
So I don't forgive

244
00:17:08,584 --> 00:17:09,625
Stop it

245
00:17:09,626 --> 00:17:11,751
I go buy you a cup of milk tea later

246
00:17:15,126 --> 00:17:16,209
Boss, where are you going?

247
00:17:55,209 --> 00:17:56,458
Everyone sits, let's order

248
00:17:56,459 --> 00:17:57,792
Have a seat

249
00:17:59,751 --> 00:18:00,541
What do you want?

250
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:01,334
Milk tea

251
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:03,666
Iced lemon tea, no sweet

252
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,209
OK, iced lemon...

253
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,250
Coffee with tea

254
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,751
OK, coffee with...

255
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,393
Did you lose a bet? Why pull a long face

256
00:18:21,459 --> 00:18:22,500
Hey, Brother Two,

257
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,167
this toast is just like your face

258
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:28,751
I didn't want to raise my voice
as I am a educated man,

259
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:30,292
but this is outrageous

260
00:18:30,584 --> 00:18:33,084
I am sorry and I will change it for you

261
00:18:33,709 --> 00:18:34,501
Make it quick!

262
00:18:38,709 --> 00:18:41,709
Damn it, is it $500 a lemon?

263
00:18:42,417 --> 00:18:43,417
Is it free?

264
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:44,959
Is it free?

265
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:46,875
I am sorry, I am sorry

266
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:47,750
That's absurd

267
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:50,417
Hey, if you don't like
the food, then don't pay

268
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:52,001
Why the scene?

269
00:18:52,251 --> 00:18:53,541
Because you are triad
and you can do anything you want?

270
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:54,834
What did you say, bitch?

271
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:57,500
Sorry, sorry

272
00:18:57,501 --> 00:18:59,292
She is in a bad mood
because her father just passed away

273
00:18:59,501 --> 00:19:02,042
That's why she is like
this, please forgive her

274
00:19:02,084 --> 00:19:03,564
My Boss's mother just passed away too

275
00:19:03,626 --> 00:19:05,167
He is in a bad mood too!

276
00:19:10,084 --> 00:19:11,417
I am sorry,

277
00:19:12,126 --> 00:19:14,126
We just finished with the
funeral arrangements,

278
00:19:14,334 --> 00:19:16,584
that's why everyone is in a bad mood

279
00:19:17,501 --> 00:19:18,459
I am sorry about that

280
00:19:22,417 --> 00:19:23,542
What?

281
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:31,751
My condolences

282
00:19:32,501 --> 00:19:33,501
You too

283
00:19:40,001 --> 00:19:41,001
Check

284
00:19:55,292 --> 00:19:56,834
Hey,

285
00:20:01,251 --> 00:20:02,459
it's for you

286
00:20:03,709 --> 00:20:04,834
It's salted mandarin drink,

287
00:20:05,334 --> 00:20:08,251
my father said you will feel better
after drinking it

288
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:10,292
Thank you

289
00:20:45,834 --> 00:20:49,125
I have been busy
with boss mother's funeral arragement,

290
00:20:49,126 --> 00:20:51,041
didn't have the time to call you

291
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:54,459
I am sorry for your loss, cheer up

292
00:20:54,751 --> 00:20:57,751
Take good care of yourself

293
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:06,209
Brother Ghost! Brother Ghost!

294
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:08,084
Who?

295
00:21:08,709 --> 00:21:09,791
It's Boobies

296
00:21:09,792 --> 00:21:11,001
Which one?

297
00:21:11,376 --> 00:21:12,501
The bigger one

298
00:21:16,126 --> 00:21:18,667
- Brother Ghost!
- You are good!

299
00:21:19,084 --> 00:21:20,791
I have been looking for you!

300
00:21:20,792 --> 00:21:22,291
Where have you been?

301
00:21:22,292 --> 00:21:23,458
Why are you looking for me?

302
00:21:23,459 --> 00:21:25,541
We are going to a concert tonight!

303
00:21:25,542 --> 00:21:27,083
Really? A concert?

304
00:21:27,084 --> 00:21:28,000
I promised you?

305
00:21:28,001 --> 00:21:30,291
Yes, it is difficult to get the tickets

306
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:32,666
- But I am really sleepy
- Brother Ghost! Brother Ghost!

307
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:34,417
Who is this again?

308
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:35,917
Boogie, the small one

309
00:21:36,876 --> 00:21:38,751
Brother Ghost, it's time to go

310
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:40,000
To where?

311
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:42,041
To the concert, don't you remember?

312
00:21:42,042 --> 00:21:43,208
Concert again?

313
00:21:43,209 --> 00:21:44,810
Why everyone wants to go to the concert?

314
00:21:45,251 --> 00:21:46,250
Hurry UP!

315
00:21:46,251 --> 00:21:47,875
Wait...

316
00:21:47,876 --> 00:21:50,208
Why don't you two go with them?

317
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:53,125
Oh no, not today Boss, I am exhausted

318
00:21:53,126 --> 00:21:54,251
Just want to go home and get some sleep

319
00:21:54,292 --> 00:21:55,333
You want to sleep too?

320
00:21:55,334 --> 00:21:56,209
Yes!

321
00:21:56,501 --> 00:21:58,792
Hey, hey

322
00:21:59,334 --> 00:22:00,958
I am really sleepy today, tired too,

323
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:02,417
just want to get home earlier,

324
00:22:03,042 --> 00:22:04,000
You are sleepy...

325
00:22:04,001 --> 00:22:06,334
why don't I go to your
place and sleep with you

326
00:22:06,584 --> 00:22:07,541
Um...

327
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:08,751
SQ?

328
00:22:10,501 --> 00:22:11,917
Then“.

329
00:22:12,084 --> 00:22:14,042
Why don't us three go
home and sleep together?

330
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,416
Together?

331
00:22:17,417 --> 00:22:18,876
You want to?

332
00:22:19,334 --> 00:22:20,584
Are you insane?

333
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:22,792
Jerk!

334
00:22:23,084 --> 00:22:25,333
Hey... just sleeping together,
what's wrong with that?

335
00:22:25,334 --> 00:22:28,876
Come on, let's sleep
together, don't leave me

336
00:22:31,251 --> 00:22:33,291
I am really tired, I
head back to home first

337
00:22:33,292 --> 00:22:34,709
Ok, see you Boss

338
00:22:37,084 --> 00:22:39,042
Hey, give me one pack of Mild Seven

339
00:22:39,917 --> 00:22:40,959
$50

340
00:23:02,126 --> 00:23:03,167
Thanks!

341
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:04,750
You want to eat?

342
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:05,416
No,

343
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:07,166
The kitchen is closed

344
00:23:07,167 --> 00:23:08,208
No, I didn't come here for food

345
00:23:08,209 --> 00:23:09,250
I had dinner

346
00:23:09,251 --> 00:23:10,666
Just passing by,

347
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:13,376
and see it's still open,

348
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,041
why are you getting them off?

349
00:23:15,042 --> 00:23:18,250
These are all the dishes that I create,

350
00:23:18,251 --> 00:23:19,916
but no customers want to try

351
00:23:19,917 --> 00:23:22,959
And we only have one chef left,

352
00:23:23,167 --> 00:23:24,334
cannot do it

353
00:23:24,501 --> 00:23:27,291
Hot Red Lips Curry? Really?

354
00:23:27,292 --> 00:23:28,751
What is it?

355
00:23:28,917 --> 00:23:30,417
I don't know either

356
00:23:31,084 --> 00:23:32,541
Let me help you

357
00:23:32,542 --> 00:23:33,625
Oh... thanks

358
00:23:33,626 --> 00:23:35,416
I am sorry for the other day,

359
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:36,458
let me take these off for you

360
00:23:36,459 --> 00:23:37,667
Sorry

361
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:39,959
Thank you

362
00:23:42,084 --> 00:23:44,959
Let me write for you! I can do it

363
00:23:45,917 --> 00:23:46,958
What do you want me to write?

364
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:48,833
How about double eggs luncheon meat noodle?

365
00:23:48,834 --> 00:23:51,417
Double eggs luncheon meat noodle, ok

366
00:23:52,459 --> 00:23:53,751
What are you doing?

367
00:23:53,876 --> 00:23:56,791
Double eggs luncheon meat...
this is an egg...

368
00:23:56,792 --> 00:24:00,000
Don't draw! Who knows what you are drawing?

369
00:24:00,001 --> 00:24:02,125
Write the words!

370
00:24:02,126 --> 00:24:03,583
It's better to read from a picture

371
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,958
Write! Write!

372
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:12,375
Fine, I write, double eggs
luncheon meat noodle, right? Luncheon...

373
00:24:12,376 --> 00:24:14,875
Your handwriting is pretty nice

374
00:24:14,876 --> 00:24:16,626
No...

375
00:24:17,292 --> 00:24:17,833
Yes, it is...

376
00:24:17,834 --> 00:24:20,667
L...u... n... c... h... e... o... n...
M... e... a... t...

377
00:24:21,292 --> 00:24:22,709
Hey... no...

378
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:24,416
- This is "Meet"
- Meet!

379
00:24:24,417 --> 00:24:28,000
- No, not this word, it's "meat"!
- Whatever,

380
00:24:28,001 --> 00:24:31,167
people go to Hong Kong style teahouse
don't read

381
00:24:53,876 --> 00:24:59,292
Hey, what's the name of your group?

382
00:24:59,542 --> 00:25:02,500
Technically, it starts with letter "H"

383
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,625
Besides killing each other,
hitting people's heads,

384
00:25:05,626 --> 00:25:06,500
What else do you guys do?

385
00:25:06,501 --> 00:25:08,125
Hitting people's head?
When did I hit someone's head?

386
00:25:08,126 --> 00:25:09,916
Last time in the Karaoke... l saw it

387
00:25:09,917 --> 00:25:11,042
Karaoke? You were there?

388
00:25:11,084 --> 00:25:14,792
Yes, I saw you hitting a man's head

389
00:25:15,709 --> 00:25:18,416
Oh... that was an special case

390
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:21,584
Normally, we don't hit people's heads

391
00:25:22,209 --> 00:25:24,376
We talk more than we act,

392
00:25:25,334 --> 00:25:27,791
There is no future for triad now

393
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:30,709
You need to compensate
for hitting someone's head

394
00:25:31,126 --> 00:25:33,334
We are businessmen actually

395
00:25:33,584 --> 00:25:34,959
Really?

396
00:25:37,209 --> 00:25:40,250
You have so many brothers with you
the other day,

397
00:25:40,251 --> 00:25:41,917
but there is a woman

398
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:43,709
The day at the teahouse?

399
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:46,708
That is a guy,

400
00:25:46,709 --> 00:25:48,667
I'll explain to you later

401
00:25:49,834 --> 00:25:50,875
This is me

402
00:25:50,876 --> 00:25:51,583
Here?

403
00:25:51,584 --> 00:25:52,334
Um

404
00:25:52,792 --> 00:25:57,501
Nice, which floor you live?

405
00:25:58,042 --> 00:26:03,209
I'll tell you later,
seems like you are much better

406
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:06,876
Thanks for that drink

407
00:26:07,042 --> 00:26:08,959
You are much better too

408
00:26:09,417 --> 00:26:14,709
Yes, because I drink a lot of it,
do you like it?

409
00:26:15,084 --> 00:26:17,750
Yes, but it was too sweet

410
00:26:17,751 --> 00:26:19,291
I cannot have too much sugar at my age

411
00:26:19,292 --> 00:26:22,291
No, you look young

412
00:26:22,292 --> 00:26:23,583
Oh, really?

413
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:25,334
How can you tell?

414
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,916
From the side? Or from the back?

415
00:26:28,917 --> 00:26:29,792
<i>L</i> am going

416
00:26:30,709 --> 00:26:32,291
Bye-bye

417
00:26:32,292 --> 00:26:33,750
I am Mei

418
00:26:33,751 --> 00:26:35,875
Mei! I am Ghost

419
00:26:35,876 --> 00:26:38,501
Little Ghost, Little Ghost

420
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:39,292
Bye-bye

421
00:26:39,334 --> 00:26:40,167
Bye-bye

422
00:26:45,251 --> 00:26:47,459
- Bye
- Bye-bye

423
00:26:58,001 --> 00:27:01,876
Come on, give me a hug! Don't be so rude

424
00:27:04,709 --> 00:27:08,166
See which floor the light
is on then I know where she lives

425
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:11,084
Wow... it's easy to climb up and get there

426
00:27:26,792 --> 00:27:31,042
"Thank you, how's going lately?
Come to have breakfast if you have time"

427
00:27:44,876 --> 00:27:45,791
Don't cry... don't cry...

428
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,458
I am scared...

429
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:50,083
Don't be afraid... bastards,

430
00:27:50,084 --> 00:27:51,167
lam gonna kill them,

431
00:27:51,917 --> 00:27:53,626
Did you see anyone suspicious?

432
00:27:54,876 --> 00:27:57,084
Where were you when it happened?

433
00:27:57,459 --> 00:27:58,791
Stop crying, it's fine now,

434
00:27:58,792 --> 00:28:00,209
Tell me everything you know!

435
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:02,458
Get some tea

436
00:28:02,459 --> 00:28:05,333
If I know then we wouldn't got messed up!
Right?

437
00:28:05,334 --> 00:28:06,375
- Uncle Two!
- Boss!

438
00:28:06,376 --> 00:28:11,167
Right! This is Ghost's place, you ask him

439
00:28:11,626 --> 00:28:13,001
Let's have tea!

440
00:28:13,209 --> 00:28:14,500
B, let's go have tea!

441
00:28:14,501 --> 00:28:15,542
Go!

442
00:28:16,251 --> 00:28:18,709
Ghost, what's happened?

443
00:28:19,084 --> 00:28:20,284
You are in bad luck this year?

444
00:28:20,292 --> 00:28:21,692
Every place of yours got messed up?

445
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:24,542
I want to ask you too,

446
00:28:24,834 --> 00:28:28,333
Wounding, criminal intimidation,
criminal damage...

447
00:28:28,334 --> 00:28:29,666
The triad is so arrogant these days,

448
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,307
you tell me how we can run business, sir?

449
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:33,839
Come here for a second

450
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:40,792
What?

451
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:42,917
I am on the street everyday,

452
00:28:43,126 --> 00:28:46,709
don't you think that I don't know things
between you and Bill

453
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:48,958
If you are on the street everyday,

454
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:51,459
then you would know what he is doing!

455
00:28:52,501 --> 00:28:55,459
You think he wants to
take care of my place?

456
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:58,417
He wants to takeover my place!

457
00:28:58,667 --> 00:29:01,750
He wants us evicted! Real estate guy!

458
00:29:01,751 --> 00:29:03,542
Anyway, I don't want any troubles,

459
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:05,042
I'll catch you people

460
00:29:05,209 --> 00:29:06,500
Things already happened,

461
00:29:06,501 --> 00:29:08,250
why don't you go catch some people?

462
00:29:08,251 --> 00:29:10,708
We are civilians, we depend on policemen

463
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:12,917
Go and catch some criminals!

464
00:29:17,334 --> 00:29:19,084
Mr Ng, do you any further information?

465
00:29:20,084 --> 00:29:22,001
We will notify you
for the identification parade

466
00:29:23,417 --> 00:29:27,459
Boss, Nine said he recognized
some of them are Bill's men

467
00:29:30,626 --> 00:29:34,876
Whatever happens in the
future, call the police

468
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:36,251
Call the police?

469
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:41,876
It costs money to call backup,
emergency call is free!

470
00:29:51,251 --> 00:29:52,250
Hey, closed?

471
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:54,376
Yes... you are passing by... again?

472
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:57,166
No, just had dinner around

473
00:29:57,167 --> 00:29:57,708
I see

474
00:29:57,709 --> 00:30:00,416
Why only you? Let me help

475
00:30:00,417 --> 00:30:01,958
No, thank you

476
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:04,459
You can't sweep like this,
take off your gloves

477
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:06,667
Really?

478
00:30:08,751 --> 00:30:09,708
Are you sure?

479
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:10,792
Of course!

480
00:30:11,167 --> 00:30:12,167
<i>OK...</i>

481
00:30:14,001 --> 00:30:16,292
when I was a kid, I swept everyday

482
00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:18,084
Why?

483
00:30:19,626 --> 00:30:21,459
Punished by my father...

484
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:24,416
When you sweep,
you need to start from the inside,

485
00:30:24,417 --> 00:30:26,417
Not like this,

486
00:30:28,084 --> 00:30:30,583
Yes right, you really know how to sweep

487
00:30:30,584 --> 00:30:31,708
Of course!

488
00:30:31,709 --> 00:30:33,083
Bruce Lee once said that...

489
00:30:33,084 --> 00:30:34,625
keep your waist
and horse stance straight in a line

490
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:37,958
Ha-ha... even for sweeping?

491
00:30:37,959 --> 00:30:40,167
Of course! Bruce Lee swept too,

492
00:30:42,834 --> 00:30:44,875
Once done, you don't have
to come out from the inside,

493
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:46,583
It won't get the floor dirty, right!

494
00:30:46,584 --> 00:30:47,167
Yes...

495
00:30:47,292 --> 00:30:48,791
Do you need to get anything?

496
00:30:48,792 --> 00:30:49,792
Oh...

497
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:57,626
Ok now!

498
00:31:01,417 --> 00:31:02,916
Let me buy you a drink

499
00:31:02,917 --> 00:31:03,791
NOW?

500
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:05,042
Or tomorrow?

501
00:31:05,292 --> 00:31:06,250
It's too late...

502
00:31:06,251 --> 00:31:07,375
How late?

503
00:31:07,376 --> 00:31:08,625
I swept the floor for you,

504
00:31:08,626 --> 00:31:09,958
I think it's fair that
you have a drink with me, ok?

505
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:11,416
Um... ok then

506
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:12,459
Turn off the light

507
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:17,417
OK

508
00:31:21,292 --> 00:31:22,376
Thank you

509
00:32:05,834 --> 00:32:07,334
One, one, one, two, two

510
00:32:09,001 --> 00:32:16,916
Two... one... one... two...

511
00:32:16,917 --> 00:32:17,959
Drink!

512
00:32:18,584 --> 00:32:24,209
That quick... it's me again...

513
00:32:28,167 --> 00:32:30,542
I can't drink anymore, I am full

514
00:32:31,209 --> 00:32:33,042
Full? I thought you are gonna throw up

515
00:32:34,459 --> 00:32:36,916
Why am I so dumb,

516
00:32:36,917 --> 00:32:41,750
I can't play this or that

517
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:45,292
not that you are dumb, I am just too good

518
00:32:46,042 --> 00:32:52,209
No, my father always said I am dumb

519
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:55,959
But, he said...

520
00:32:56,417 --> 00:33:01,084
no matter how dumb I am,
he would support me,

521
00:33:01,584 --> 00:33:03,834
like a tree

522
00:33:05,251 --> 00:33:12,167
Now he is gone, no one supports me anymore

523
00:33:12,917 --> 00:33:17,376
He spent his whole life for this teahouse

524
00:33:18,292 --> 00:33:20,959
Now the employees want to leave

525
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:25,042
Neither I have to do it nor not to do it,

526
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:29,501
Even if I keep doing it
but I really don't know how

527
00:33:30,042 --> 00:33:32,208
Ok! I know how to do it!
I know how to do it!

528
00:33:32,209 --> 00:33:34,250
You do?

529
00:33:34,251 --> 00:33:37,667
You keep doing it then you can do it!

530
00:33:38,209 --> 00:33:39,750
Bullshit! I know that!

531
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:41,875
No, no bullshit, just keep doing it

532
00:33:41,876 --> 00:33:43,250
If you don't want to do it, then don't

533
00:33:43,251 --> 00:33:45,501
If you want to do it, then do it,

534
00:33:45,751 --> 00:33:47,291
I will support you

535
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:51,417
You support me? Everyone says so!

536
00:33:51,459 --> 00:33:54,459
So what do you want me to do? Say it!

537
00:33:56,126 --> 00:33:58,375
I want you to be like my father

538
00:33:58,376 --> 00:33:59,208
Oh no!

539
00:33:59,209 --> 00:34:01,626
- You mean it? Really?
- Be my tree

540
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:03,416
Oh... be your tree...

541
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:05,750
I thought you want me
to like your father... dead,

542
00:34:05,751 --> 00:34:09,541
- How am I gonna support you?
- No, no more talking about death,

543
00:34:09,542 --> 00:34:12,708
Oh, ok, ok, no more death
talking, I won't die

544
00:34:12,709 --> 00:34:14,209
I will be your tree

545
00:34:14,376 --> 00:34:18,541
I will plant a tree, let me plant a tree

546
00:34:18,542 --> 00:34:25,375
Look! It's growing, ok?

547
00:34:25,376 --> 00:34:26,583
Be my tree...

548
00:34:26,584 --> 00:34:29,625
Sure... ok... l will be your tree

549
00:34:29,626 --> 00:34:31,459
No... but...

550
00:34:31,751 --> 00:34:33,916
Ok... Cheers!

551
00:34:33,917 --> 00:34:35,791
Be your tree, ok?

552
00:34:35,792 --> 00:34:38,541
Be your tree, why it sounds so weird?

553
00:34:38,542 --> 00:34:40,416
- Ha-ha!
- Be your tree,

554
00:34:40,417 --> 00:34:44,167
good, I will be your tree, cheers!

555
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:51,459
Hey... Hey... it's not good

556
00:35:40,459 --> 00:35:41,876
Excuse me Sir...

557
00:35:55,709 --> 00:35:56,708
What do you want to drink?

558
00:35:56,709 --> 00:35:57,416
Iced Lemon tea

559
00:35:57,417 --> 00:35:58,126
0k!

560
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:11,834
Why are you here?

561
00:36:13,626 --> 00:36:14,667
Good Morning

562
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:15,876
Good Morning

563
00:36:16,917 --> 00:36:18,084
It's for you

564
00:36:18,459 --> 00:36:21,042
Why giving me flowers?

565
00:36:22,042 --> 00:36:25,042
Nothing... you were drunk last night,

566
00:36:25,084 --> 00:36:30,542
and you said your father was like a tree
and support you,

567
00:36:30,751 --> 00:36:34,833
I have been thinking of it
for a whole night, I think...

568
00:36:34,834 --> 00:36:37,083
I think I can be your tree to support you

569
00:36:37,084 --> 00:36:42,376
Oh! Why did I tell you this,
it's so embarrassing

570
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:44,959
People do have consciousness
even if they are blackout drunk

571
00:36:45,042 --> 00:36:46,125
Come on, take it first

572
00:36:46,126 --> 00:36:48,166
What a cliché

573
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:50,125
- No, they are the best
- I cannot have them

574
00:36:50,126 --> 00:36:52,000
There is chocolate too,
I cannot have them...

575
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,125
I bought them, not stole it

576
00:36:54,126 --> 00:36:55,708
The saleslady said this is the best,

577
00:36:55,709 --> 00:36:58,208
No more arguments,
I'll have them put in a vase

578
00:36:58,209 --> 00:36:59,333
everyone buys it

579
00:36:59,334 --> 00:37:00,251
Thank... thank you

580
00:37:00,501 --> 00:37:01,459
Boss!

581
00:37:01,959 --> 00:37:03,167
Hey, come here!

582
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:05,708
Let me introduce to you,

583
00:37:05,709 --> 00:37:08,251
this is Leung, my brother This is Mei

584
00:37:11,459 --> 00:37:12,458
I go back to work

585
00:37:12,459 --> 00:37:13,292
OK!

586
00:37:29,834 --> 00:37:31,459
What do you think about her?

587
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:36,334
She can be a girlfriend,

588
00:37:39,792 --> 00:37:43,667
I can feel it, I feel it

589
00:37:44,542 --> 00:37:46,791
Boss! You had me here
and just ask me this question?

590
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:50,459
No, I had you here
to talk about some real business

591
00:37:50,792 --> 00:37:53,125
Didn't you suggest to run a teahouse?

592
00:37:53,126 --> 00:37:57,083
I asked you here
to take a look of this teahouse,

593
00:37:57,084 --> 00:37:59,376
also take a look of her

594
00:38:04,459 --> 00:38:07,126
I found a new direction in my life

595
00:38:09,542 --> 00:38:12,751
Your choice is so unexpected

596
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:15,792
No, I always like this type

597
00:38:17,126 --> 00:38:18,542
Oh really?

598
00:38:19,376 --> 00:38:24,334
Look at her, she is really interesting

599
00:38:27,209 --> 00:38:29,208
I want to go to the Disneyland with her

600
00:38:29,209 --> 00:38:30,000
Really?

601
00:38:30,001 --> 00:38:31,042
Really

602
00:38:44,792 --> 00:38:46,834
What is the price of Gei Wai Shrimp?

603
00:38:47,167 --> 00:38:48,917
$80 per kilo

604
00:38:49,209 --> 00:38:50,958
That's expensive, cheaper please!

605
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:52,375
My father used to buy from you very often

606
00:38:52,376 --> 00:38:53,750
It's already very cheap

607
00:38:53,751 --> 00:38:54,951
how about giving you for free?

608
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:56,751
Well, that's not necessary

609
00:38:57,042 --> 00:38:59,208
Hey, what are you doing?

610
00:38:59,209 --> 00:39:00,833
You tried to rob? What?

611
00:39:00,834 --> 00:39:01,833
Brother Ghost!

612
00:39:01,834 --> 00:39:03,042
Hey, how much?

613
00:39:03,084 --> 00:39:04,333
You and I don't talk about money!

614
00:39:04,334 --> 00:39:06,583
Shrimp, crab or fish,
take anything you want!

615
00:39:06,584 --> 00:39:09,167
Hey, take anything you want!

616
00:39:10,334 --> 00:39:12,500
Hey, what's wrong? Hey...

617
00:39:12,501 --> 00:39:13,876
She is throwing a temper

618
00:39:13,917 --> 00:39:17,458
Hey, no, it's not free,

619
00:39:17,459 --> 00:39:19,291
just because I helped them

620
00:39:19,292 --> 00:39:20,916
What exactly do you guys want?

621
00:39:20,917 --> 00:39:22,333
Either you give them back to me,

622
00:39:22,334 --> 00:39:24,250
Or you have them brought
back to the teahouse?

623
00:39:24,251 --> 00:39:25,376
The chefs are waiting

624
00:39:26,542 --> 00:39:29,041
Yes sister! I will have them brought
to them in 3 minutes

625
00:39:29,042 --> 00:39:30,458
- Don't worry! Let's go!
- Hey!

626
00:39:30,459 --> 00:39:31,041
OK!

627
00:39:31,042 --> 00:39:34,001
What sister, who is your sister!

628
00:39:35,917 --> 00:39:37,584
Stop following me

629
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,417
Hey! Hey! Hey!

630
00:39:45,001 --> 00:39:47,584
I feel like selling Cocaine now!

631
00:39:47,834 --> 00:39:49,333
Look at you, you must be used to...

632
00:39:49,334 --> 00:39:52,500
- No! I don't do this!
- Really? I don't buy it

633
00:39:52,501 --> 00:39:54,501
I do women, I don't do this stuff

634
00:40:05,001 --> 00:40:08,417
Boss! You have been running for an hour,

635
00:40:08,459 --> 00:40:11,459
That's enough, take a break!

636
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:15,625
You are very keen on it,
Gym in the morning,

637
00:40:15,626 --> 00:40:17,125
football in the afternoon

638
00:40:17,126 --> 00:40:18,625
And running at night,

639
00:40:18,626 --> 00:40:22,291
You may even try Wing Chun and Thai boxing!

640
00:40:22,292 --> 00:40:23,291
Anything else?

641
00:40:23,292 --> 00:40:24,208
Bungee jump

642
00:40:24,209 --> 00:40:25,166
Keep going, anything else?

643
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:26,041
Water rafting! That's exciting!

644
00:40:26,042 --> 00:40:27,251
Really there are more...

645
00:40:27,417 --> 00:40:32,917
You are quite talky among people your age

646
00:40:34,542 --> 00:40:35,625
Why didn't I see you these days?

647
00:40:35,626 --> 00:40:36,626
Where have you been?

648
00:40:37,751 --> 00:40:39,750
I am always around,

649
00:40:39,751 --> 00:40:41,792
just that you only care for girls

650
00:40:42,209 --> 00:40:44,459
Speaking of which, how's the progress?

651
00:40:45,792 --> 00:40:51,917
I am about to ask you,
what do you think about Mei?

652
00:40:53,542 --> 00:40:54,666
- She is nice
- Really?

653
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:56,250
Better than the rest of yours!

654
00:40:56,251 --> 00:41:00,167
That's good, I want to talk to you
about something

655
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:01,916
I have thought about it,

656
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:04,751
I want to invest in Mei's teahouse

657
00:41:05,042 --> 00:41:06,125
Either business or personal,

658
00:41:06,126 --> 00:41:08,792
I do think I should give her a hand. Right?

659
00:41:09,417 --> 00:41:10,626
Um...

660
00:41:12,751 --> 00:41:13,791
Why are you still thinking?

661
00:41:13,792 --> 00:41:15,459
It is your idea to run a teahouse

662
00:41:15,751 --> 00:41:18,459
Yes, but we haven't done it before

663
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:21,792
Brother, it is your idea

664
00:41:22,376 --> 00:41:24,375
Barack Obama hasn't been
a president before,

665
00:41:24,376 --> 00:41:25,584
but he is doing quite well now

666
00:41:28,584 --> 00:41:33,459
Alright! Either business or personal,
it's your call!

667
00:41:33,709 --> 00:41:36,875
Great! You say yes and so it is!

668
00:41:36,876 --> 00:41:37,750
I will run for 2 more laps

669
00:41:37,751 --> 00:41:38,834
Again?

670
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:47,584
Here... smoking...

671
00:41:47,626 --> 00:41:48,876
Smoking...

672
00:41:53,459 --> 00:41:54,541
Smoking...

673
00:41:54,542 --> 00:41:56,084
Yes, smoking...

674
00:41:56,584 --> 00:41:57,501
Jackass.

675
00:41:57,584 --> 00:41:59,166
- Bastard
- It kills!

676
00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:00,768
- It kills!
- You are going to die badly!

677
00:42:03,792 --> 00:42:06,917
You keep running and I... l am dying!

678
00:42:15,751 --> 00:42:17,791
Hey, the delivery guy that you hired
is not good,

679
00:42:17,792 --> 00:42:19,375
He left for more than an hour
and still haven't come back

680
00:42:19,376 --> 00:42:20,876
No sense of direction, just like you

681
00:42:21,126 --> 00:42:24,376
I really don't know what he is thinking

682
00:42:29,709 --> 00:42:34,250
Hey! What's the matter with you?

683
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:36,376
Why does it take so long
to deliver a breakfast?

684
00:42:36,542 --> 00:42:40,875
I got tired and these are just feet

685
00:42:40,876 --> 00:42:42,666
So is it a time management issue?

686
00:42:42,667 --> 00:42:44,083
Is it you are not happy?

687
00:42:44,084 --> 00:42:46,333
If you are not happy, then quit

688
00:42:46,334 --> 00:42:48,126
What do you mean? Are you threatening me?

689
00:42:48,417 --> 00:42:49,626
Are you threatening me?

690
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:54,709
Kiddo, do you know who you are talking to?

691
00:42:54,876 --> 00:42:58,916
Who? Wow... so many people,

692
00:42:58,917 --> 00:43:00,001
Then I'll leave!

693
00:43:00,709 --> 00:43:04,541
Leave? Apologize to my sister first

694
00:43:04,542 --> 00:43:05,250
Who is your sister?

695
00:43:05,251 --> 00:43:06,126
This is my sister

696
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:07,584
I am not your sister!

697
00:43:08,251 --> 00:43:13,542
She is not your sister,
who actually is your sister?

698
00:43:14,001 --> 00:43:14,834
Huh!

699
00:43:15,001 --> 00:43:16,042
All of them are!

700
00:43:17,334 --> 00:43:19,291
Sorry sisters,

701
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:22,376
It's my problem, I'll... I'll leave

702
00:43:22,542 --> 00:43:23,459
Hey!

703
00:43:23,626 --> 00:43:24,459
Hey!

704
00:43:25,376 --> 00:43:26,667
The money!

705
00:43:26,876 --> 00:43:28,667
I forgot...

706
00:43:29,917 --> 00:43:30,917
<i>I</i> am going

707
00:43:35,667 --> 00:43:38,875
Don't waste time on these schmucks

708
00:43:38,876 --> 00:43:40,875
Leung! Find someone else to replace him!

709
00:43:40,876 --> 00:43:42,208
- Hey! Let's go!
- Let's get to work

710
00:43:42,209 --> 00:43:45,126
Hey, I got something to say to you

711
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:50,250
What's wrong?
Want to share some secrets with me?

712
00:43:50,251 --> 00:43:52,709
Why your brothers keep calling me sister?

713
00:43:52,792 --> 00:43:55,083
I don't know, I didn't
ask them to say that,

714
00:43:55,084 --> 00:43:56,709
It's totally their ideas

715
00:43:57,084 --> 00:43:59,584
Anyway, I don't want to hear them
calling me sister again

716
00:44:01,251 --> 00:44:02,709
But, there is something that

717
00:44:03,417 --> 00:44:05,377
I have been wanting to talk to you
for a long time

718
00:44:05,917 --> 00:44:08,000
I have been observing for long

719
00:44:08,001 --> 00:44:11,750
I found that, your teahouse,

720
00:44:11,751 --> 00:44:13,708
is lack of one thing

721
00:44:13,709 --> 00:44:15,042
What?

722
00:44:15,126 --> 00:44:16,001
Manpower

723
00:44:17,709 --> 00:44:21,126
It is no need to observe,
it's very obvious!

724
00:44:21,542 --> 00:44:24,167
Right, that's mean you agree with me

725
00:44:24,376 --> 00:44:25,958
I don't have much,

726
00:44:25,959 --> 00:44:27,359
what I do have is a lot of brothers

727
00:44:27,584 --> 00:44:30,084
All my brothers have nothing to do

728
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:36,125
With or without experience in catering,

729
00:44:36,126 --> 00:44:38,126
I will have them helped here

730
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:41,959
I want to, but I cannot afford to hire
that many staff

731
00:44:42,042 --> 00:44:43,791
Just your approval is enough,
you don't need to hire them

732
00:44:43,792 --> 00:44:44,959
It's free

733
00:44:45,042 --> 00:44:47,250
We will discuss later
when we make some money

734
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:49,625
Consider that as my investment
in your teahouse,

735
00:44:49,626 --> 00:44:50,346
what do you think?

736
00:44:50,584 --> 00:44:53,251
Let's do it! Let's get some helps here

737
00:44:53,459 --> 00:44:54,458
Uncle Kwan!

738
00:44:54,459 --> 00:44:56,501
Look, Uncle Kwan agrees too!

739
00:44:57,959 --> 00:44:59,334
Sister Mei, it's done

740
00:44:59,417 --> 00:45:01,459
It's done, here the money

741
00:45:01,876 --> 00:45:04,083
It's absolutely their ideas, not mine

742
00:45:04,084 --> 00:45:05,583
But you can stop them!

743
00:45:05,584 --> 00:45:06,792
I cannot

744
00:45:08,542 --> 00:45:10,042
Stop calling me sister!

745
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:11,584
Yes, sister

746
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:12,584
Hey!

747
00:45:13,084 --> 00:45:14,876
See, couldn't stop them

748
00:45:20,292 --> 00:45:21,501
Hello everyone,

749
00:45:22,209 --> 00:45:23,876
I am the representative of the developer,

750
00:45:23,959 --> 00:45:26,541
we are very interested in buying your shop

751
00:45:26,542 --> 00:45:29,334
I come here today to
discuss a deal with you

752
00:45:29,792 --> 00:45:31,875
We are not moving,

753
00:45:31,876 --> 00:45:33,916
also the lease has not run out yet

754
00:45:33,917 --> 00:45:35,500
If you want to talk, find the landlord

755
00:45:35,501 --> 00:45:36,834
It's no use to come here

756
00:45:37,209 --> 00:45:39,751
Understood! That's why I want
to talk to Brother Ghost

757
00:45:44,209 --> 00:45:46,208
The lease has not run out yet

758
00:45:46,209 --> 00:45:48,792
and the tenant doesn't want to move,
what else can we talk?

759
00:45:49,167 --> 00:45:50,376
You are the landlord?

760
00:45:50,709 --> 00:45:53,041
It doesn't matter if I
am the landlord or not

761
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:55,000
I absolutely understand
what landlords think,

762
00:45:55,001 --> 00:45:56,126
it's all about money

763
00:45:56,626 --> 00:46:00,001
If you accept the price, then sell it

764
00:46:00,626 --> 00:46:05,584
Even though I am the landlord,
but rule is rule,

765
00:46:05,792 --> 00:46:07,416
we don't just care about the money

766
00:46:07,417 --> 00:46:10,291
We care about loyalty and morality too

767
00:46:10,292 --> 00:46:13,541
To compare with thugs who just care
about money but not morality,

768
00:46:13,542 --> 00:46:15,751
there is a huge difference

769
00:46:16,042 --> 00:46:18,959
I would sell it if I were you
who care very much about loyalty

770
00:46:19,751 --> 00:46:22,042
You can give the money to your brothers

771
00:46:22,167 --> 00:46:23,833
and everyone can start a new life

772
00:46:23,834 --> 00:46:25,958
It's better than making your own decision,

773
00:46:25,959 --> 00:46:27,209
and have others suffered

774
00:46:29,959 --> 00:46:33,000
Go to hell! Who you are saying
that got others suffered?

775
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:35,209
You or me?

776
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:37,917
We are all educated people
and don't say the F-word

777
00:46:38,084 --> 00:46:39,958
I don't think we can have anything
concluded today, think it through again,

778
00:46:39,959 --> 00:46:42,209
I will be waiting for your call,
sorry for the disturb

779
00:46:42,709 --> 00:46:44,250
You save it Bill,

780
00:46:44,251 --> 00:46:46,083
I would rather burn my shop down,

781
00:46:46,084 --> 00:46:47,166
than selling it to you

782
00:46:47,167 --> 00:46:48,292
Well said!

783
00:46:48,792 --> 00:46:50,292
Take it easy... take it easy

784
00:46:50,876 --> 00:46:52,209
- Give them a lesson
- Ok

785
00:46:53,584 --> 00:46:56,542
Hey, you are the landlord?

786
00:46:56,667 --> 00:46:57,583
Why don't I know it?

787
00:46:57,584 --> 00:46:59,001
Why don't you tell me?

788
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:00,750
Why do I have to tell you?

789
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:02,334
Why do you need to know?

790
00:47:02,584 --> 00:47:04,041
It doesn't matter if I
am the landlord or not

791
00:47:04,042 --> 00:47:05,751
I didn't raise the rent

792
00:47:06,584 --> 00:47:11,000
No, I am just worried if he comes again

793
00:47:11,001 --> 00:47:15,000
No, my brothers will be here every day

794
00:47:15,001 --> 00:47:17,166
They won't come, what they can do?

795
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,876
Just bluffing, don't worry

796
00:47:22,417 --> 00:47:29,291
One, two, three... Here is your uniform

797
00:47:29,292 --> 00:47:32,083
Outside you are a staff of this teahouse,

798
00:47:32,084 --> 00:47:33,166
but inside...

799
00:47:33,167 --> 00:47:36,916
inside, you are also just a staff
of this teahouse

800
00:47:36,917 --> 00:47:38,417
Ok, that's all I wanted to say

801
00:47:38,542 --> 00:47:40,625
We are family now,

802
00:47:40,626 --> 00:47:42,500
Uncle Kwan will help you guys,

803
00:47:42,501 --> 00:47:45,501
he will tell everyone
what his job is later,

804
00:47:45,709 --> 00:47:47,500
Ok! Uncle Kwan, we are fine!

805
00:47:47,501 --> 00:47:49,625
Sister, just feel free to order us,

806
00:47:49,626 --> 00:47:50,417
lam Shing

807
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:53,084
This is my one last time to tell you guys,

808
00:47:53,542 --> 00:47:56,251
Stop calling me sister!

809
00:48:00,251 --> 00:48:01,126
Sorry!

810
00:48:08,626 --> 00:48:12,501
But you are truly our sister,
what else we can call you?

811
00:48:14,251 --> 00:48:15,376
What are you saying?

812
00:48:22,084 --> 00:48:26,166
O...Ok... everyone just stops it

813
00:48:26,167 --> 00:48:26,958
Let's get working

814
00:48:26,959 --> 00:48:29,667
Here... come here... l
tell you how to place them

815
00:48:29,709 --> 00:48:30,416
Haven't I told you?

816
00:48:30,417 --> 00:48:32,667
I already told them, but
they just can't stop I

817
00:48:34,001 --> 00:48:36,250
Hey... hey... don't be mad,

818
00:48:36,251 --> 00:48:38,541
Just a name, don't be so serious

819
00:48:38,542 --> 00:48:40,834
It's right to call her sister, isn't it?

820
00:48:59,459 --> 00:49:01,667
Wow, Brother Two, so many firemen

821
00:49:01,876 --> 00:49:06,166
Yeah, only those little dirty thugs,

822
00:49:06,167 --> 00:49:07,876
do it this way

823
00:49:08,126 --> 00:49:09,375
Speaking of taking possession of property,

824
00:49:09,376 --> 00:49:10,876
Bill that prick,

825
00:49:11,042 --> 00:49:14,167
would exactly do it this
way, son of a bitch

826
00:49:15,667 --> 00:49:18,417
Thanks, sweetie, thanks

827
00:49:27,542 --> 00:49:30,500
Uncle Two, no smoking, please do not smoke!

828
00:49:30,501 --> 00:49:31,584
Yes, I see it

829
00:49:33,542 --> 00:49:35,667
Hey, who want to have a taste?

830
00:49:35,792 --> 00:49:37,042
I do

831
00:49:38,584 --> 00:49:39,959
I can't eat anymore

832
00:49:40,292 --> 00:49:42,833
Come on, have a bite

833
00:49:42,834 --> 00:49:43,792
Wow...

834
00:49:44,876 --> 00:49:47,501
Which dish is the most delicious one
in our teahouse?

835
00:49:48,126 --> 00:49:51,875
It's totally different from other teahouses

836
00:49:51,876 --> 00:49:55,000
Ramen, vegetable meat bun, dumpling,

837
00:49:55,001 --> 00:49:57,167
they are irrelevant to
Hong Kong style teahouse

838
00:49:57,417 --> 00:49:59,084
Yes you are right, that's weird

839
00:49:59,376 --> 00:50:01,958
Pineapple bun, egg tart, these are
the specialty of Hong Kong style teahouse

840
00:50:01,959 --> 00:50:04,000
That's what a teahouse is

841
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,875
Who are going to make pineapple bun
and egg tart?

842
00:50:06,876 --> 00:50:09,251
It's so troublesome and
has no profit to make

843
00:50:09,542 --> 00:50:11,208
How can you call it a teahouse,

844
00:50:11,209 --> 00:50:13,167
without these kinds of food?

845
00:50:14,251 --> 00:50:17,000
Hung, you got experience,

846
00:50:17,001 --> 00:50:18,375
think about it

847
00:50:18,376 --> 00:50:19,459
0k!

848
00:50:19,542 --> 00:50:22,666
It's fresh and hot! Fresh and hot!

849
00:50:22,667 --> 00:50:24,291
Wow...

850
00:50:24,292 --> 00:50:25,125
Boss, have a bit,

851
00:50:25,126 --> 00:50:25,958
what is it?

852
00:50:25,959 --> 00:50:26,876
Pineapple bun!

853
00:50:26,959 --> 00:50:28,751
It looks rather like a pastry

854
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:30,084
Brother Two made it

855
00:50:30,501 --> 00:50:32,751
You taught me how to do it

856
00:50:33,084 --> 00:50:38,709
A Japanese cuisine,
like a fried pineapple! Weird?

857
00:50:39,334 --> 00:50:40,376
SQ?

858
00:50:41,126 --> 00:50:42,667
- It's awful...
- Damn it!

859
00:50:43,834 --> 00:50:48,292
You said you have done it before? Bragger

860
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:51,083
I truly did, for 2 months,

861
00:50:51,084 --> 00:50:53,751
then it closed, that makes sense?

862
00:50:56,167 --> 00:50:59,084
Chef, You have to tell me honestly,

863
00:50:59,417 --> 00:51:02,042
what is your secrets of
making pineapple bun?

864
00:51:02,126 --> 00:51:04,375
Yes, why the buns you make are so big,

865
00:51:04,376 --> 00:51:06,501
but mine are so small?

866
00:51:06,917 --> 00:51:08,750
Because they are not fully puffed up

867
00:51:08,751 --> 00:51:12,041
And our pastries,
why they collapse in the middle?

868
00:51:12,042 --> 00:51:13,751
Because they are over puffed up

869
00:51:14,709 --> 00:51:17,292
Don't you lie to me,
what's the secret? Spill it!

870
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:25,209
You should brush <i>2</i> layers of custard,
after putting in the oven,

871
00:51:25,542 --> 00:51:27,958
you have to keep checking
it from time to time,

872
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:29,958
- once the pastry turns lightly brown,
- The color changes! The color changes!

873
00:51:29,959 --> 00:51:31,751
Lower the heat!

874
00:51:34,501 --> 00:51:36,376
This time should be ok

875
00:51:36,917 --> 00:51:40,875
Everyone, here are the fresh
and hot pineapple buns

876
00:51:40,876 --> 00:51:42,917
It looks right this time...

877
00:51:43,209 --> 00:51:45,291
- it's still very hot,
- It's very hot,

878
00:51:45,292 --> 00:51:47,959
- good stuff
- Be careful, very hot

879
00:51:52,417 --> 00:51:53,541
- How is it? How is it?
- Is that ok?

880
00:51:53,542 --> 00:51:54,875
Good! That's right!

881
00:51:54,876 --> 00:51:55,500
Really?

882
00:51:55,501 --> 00:51:56,666
That's the taste!

883
00:51:56,667 --> 00:51:57,416
Let's try the scramble egg then,

884
00:51:57,417 --> 00:51:59,459
Ming cooked it with Uncle
Two's secret recipe

885
00:51:59,709 --> 00:52:01,834
Come on, let's try...

886
00:52:04,209 --> 00:52:06,042
It works this time, doesn't it?

887
00:52:06,876 --> 00:52:09,126
Why don't you guys wait for me?

888
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:09,875
Taste it...

889
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:10,750
B, where have you been?

890
00:52:10,751 --> 00:52:12,042
I haven't seen you whole day

891
00:52:12,417 --> 00:52:14,791
Every teahouse has a
spirit, what a spirit is?

892
00:52:14,792 --> 00:52:16,084
A cup of milk tea!

893
00:52:16,459 --> 00:52:18,250
We specially went for Giant today,

894
00:52:18,251 --> 00:52:21,376
asked him to tell us the secret
of making a cup of milk tea

895
00:52:21,584 --> 00:52:23,958
He also promised us,
to share the tea leaf with us

896
00:52:23,959 --> 00:52:25,625
Wow, we are impeccable,

897
00:52:25,626 --> 00:52:27,146
We now can make a good cup of milk tea

898
00:52:27,251 --> 00:52:29,791
Milk tea, scramble egg, pineapple bun

899
00:52:29,792 --> 00:52:32,334
From now on, these will be our specialties

900
00:52:32,501 --> 00:52:33,458
We are coming back!

901
00:52:33,459 --> 00:52:35,042
Yes, better than Chow Kee next door

902
00:52:35,292 --> 00:52:38,750
Wait... wait... we are
in a pretty good shape,

903
00:52:38,751 --> 00:52:41,334
but seems like we are still
lack of something special

904
00:52:41,667 --> 00:52:43,291
I actually have a thought,

905
00:52:43,292 --> 00:52:46,250
I always have a question,
why a pineapple bun has no pineapple in it,

906
00:52:46,251 --> 00:52:47,751
but still calls a pineapple bun?

907
00:52:47,876 --> 00:52:49,666
I am thinking that our pineapple buns
should have pineapple in it

908
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:50,791
Again?

909
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:52,250
No, I agree!

910
00:52:52,251 --> 00:52:54,041
There is cocktail in a cocktail bun,

911
00:52:54,042 --> 00:52:57,208
mexican in a mexican bun, right?

912
00:52:57,209 --> 00:52:59,501
Boss, you really do agree to everything

913
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:00,834
Have a think about it

914
00:53:01,251 --> 00:53:02,876
It's worth a try

915
00:53:02,917 --> 00:53:06,041
We can put pineapple on
top of a pineapple bun

916
00:53:06,042 --> 00:53:07,083
Yes, we can

917
00:53:07,084 --> 00:53:08,334
pineapple toasties

918
00:53:18,751 --> 00:53:22,001
What are you up to lately?

919
00:53:43,876 --> 00:53:45,208
Hello, Park's teahouse

920
00:53:45,209 --> 00:53:46,583
Mei please, thank you

921
00:53:46,584 --> 00:53:47,791
I am Mei

922
00:53:47,792 --> 00:53:49,501
Hello Mei, this is Ghost's ex-wife,

923
00:53:49,834 --> 00:53:52,709
I would like to invite
you for a dinner, ok?

924
00:53:54,042 --> 00:53:58,126
O..ok, when?

925
00:53:58,792 --> 00:54:00,583
Hey, where are you? Are you here?

926
00:54:00,584 --> 00:54:01,667
Yes, I'll be there soon

927
00:54:01,917 --> 00:54:04,167
Where are you?

928
00:54:04,251 --> 00:54:05,292
Turn around!

929
00:54:05,501 --> 00:54:07,167
You scared me, what did you buy?

930
00:54:07,251 --> 00:54:08,584
Let's hang up first

931
00:54:09,459 --> 00:54:10,083
What did you buy?

932
00:54:10,084 --> 00:54:11,750
Cake, watch, same old same old

933
00:54:11,751 --> 00:54:14,458
Watch again? Who asked you to buy a watch?

934
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:15,625
You did

935
00:54:15,626 --> 00:54:17,458
Did I? Ten years ago?

936
00:54:17,459 --> 00:54:19,291
Wow, that's expensive!

937
00:54:19,292 --> 00:54:20,958
I bought her a car, I bought her a house,

938
00:54:20,959 --> 00:54:22,166
I shouldn't have bought her anything else!

939
00:54:22,167 --> 00:54:23,959
- Fine, let's go.
- Huh...

940
00:54:24,542 --> 00:54:27,541
Boss, here you go, I'll leave

941
00:54:27,542 --> 00:54:29,125
Let's go together!

942
00:54:29,126 --> 00:54:30,708
- No
- Let's go together!

943
00:54:30,709 --> 00:54:32,000
Quick, I need you there!

944
00:54:32,001 --> 00:54:33,251
Go!

945
00:54:40,334 --> 00:54:41,667
Boss, what's the matter with you?

946
00:54:42,084 --> 00:54:43,500
I am nervous!

947
00:54:43,501 --> 00:54:45,209
Why are you nervous? Press it!

948
00:54:47,834 --> 00:54:50,834
I asked that witch to have Mei invited

949
00:54:51,584 --> 00:54:53,417
Hey, you press it

950
00:55:02,001 --> 00:55:07,083
Hi, happy birthday! You
are beautiful tonight!

951
00:55:07,084 --> 00:55:08,876
Oh, what a coincidence

952
00:55:10,126 --> 00:55:11,876
I invited Mei

953
00:55:14,001 --> 00:55:15,042
Have a seat

954
00:55:15,251 --> 00:55:16,458
I go to the kitchen

955
00:55:16,459 --> 00:55:17,417
0k!

956
00:55:28,834 --> 00:55:29,708
<i>L</i> 90 help her!

957
00:55:29,709 --> 00:55:30,459
<i>OK</i>

958
00:55:33,417 --> 00:55:35,084
What are you doing? Sit!

959
00:55:42,376 --> 00:55:44,125
Do you need some help?

960
00:55:44,126 --> 00:55:45,583
No, thanks

961
00:55:45,584 --> 00:55:47,000
I can't cook

962
00:55:47,001 --> 00:55:48,750
how about I wash the vegetables

963
00:55:48,751 --> 00:55:50,000
that I can do

964
00:55:50,001 --> 00:55:51,459
I already washed them

965
00:55:51,834 --> 00:55:52,709
Oh...

966
00:55:55,167 --> 00:55:57,291
Hey, Boss, why are you standing here? Sit!

967
00:55:57,292 --> 00:55:58,751
Leave me alone

968
00:56:05,542 --> 00:56:07,291
Hey, do I have a double chin?

969
00:56:07,292 --> 00:56:09,876
You look great, have a seat!

970
00:56:10,417 --> 00:56:12,791
Mei, why don't you ask me,

971
00:56:12,792 --> 00:56:14,709
don't you want to know why I invited you?

972
00:56:15,792 --> 00:56:17,501
I guess I know...

973
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:21,541
Ghost asked me to, he wants me to test you

974
00:56:21,542 --> 00:56:25,126
I told him bluntly,

975
00:56:25,376 --> 00:56:26,667
he is way older than you,

976
00:56:27,042 --> 00:56:28,667
you are not going to be with him right?

977
00:56:28,959 --> 00:56:30,126
He is crazy!

978
00:56:30,584 --> 00:56:33,084
Well... age is not a problem actually

979
00:56:34,001 --> 00:56:39,751
I understand, they might be evil-looking

980
00:56:39,959 --> 00:56:42,334
but actually they are just like kids,

981
00:56:42,626 --> 00:56:44,375
I am like a mother to them,

982
00:56:44,376 --> 00:56:46,217
have to teach and take
care of them one by one

983
00:56:47,001 --> 00:56:49,125
They are not really that bad,

984
00:56:49,126 --> 00:56:51,001
sometimes they are quite funny

985
00:56:51,126 --> 00:56:57,375
Huh, they may be funny now,
but when I was young,

986
00:56:57,376 --> 00:56:59,126
we argued everyday!

987
00:56:59,667 --> 00:57:02,500
He would rather spent the whole night
with his gangs,

988
00:57:02,501 --> 00:57:04,459
but not coming back home

989
00:57:04,626 --> 00:57:07,251
I was young too, so we got divorced

990
00:57:08,126 --> 00:57:12,334
But we get along now, he
takes good care of me

991
00:57:12,584 --> 00:57:15,417
he bought this house for me

992
00:57:15,876 --> 00:57:21,500
Wow... this house... then
he must be very rich

993
00:57:21,501 --> 00:57:26,084
Well, it's been a long time ago,
but the situation now is...

994
00:57:26,334 --> 00:57:30,792
karaoke, night clubs and saunas,

995
00:57:31,126 --> 00:57:33,126
even those old men they
all go for young girls

996
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:39,291
but they do have principles,
those things that are monstrous,

997
00:57:39,292 --> 00:57:40,626
they don't do

998
00:57:41,042 --> 00:57:43,126
They are all afraid of retribution

999
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:45,209
They know where the bottom line is

1000
00:57:45,376 --> 00:57:46,856
And they are not far from the bottom!

1001
00:57:47,459 --> 00:57:50,083
Try? I have spent a lot of hours on it,

1002
00:57:50,084 --> 00:57:51,792
- Wow, it smells good!
- It's good

1003
00:57:52,209 --> 00:57:53,292
Try it

1004
00:57:55,876 --> 00:57:56,583
Um...

1005
00:57:56,584 --> 00:57:57,459
How is it?

1006
00:57:57,834 --> 00:57:58,541
Delicious!

1007
00:57:58,542 --> 00:57:59,917
- Really?
'Yes, very good!

1008
00:58:00,334 --> 00:58:02,625
Hey Mei, take the dishes out

1009
00:58:02,626 --> 00:58:03,584
<i>OK</i>

1010
00:58:10,917 --> 00:58:13,251
Hey, what did she say? What did she say?

1011
00:58:14,001 --> 00:58:15,750
What is it? Is it a yes or no?

1012
00:58:15,751 --> 00:58:16,709
No!

1013
00:58:16,917 --> 00:58:20,666
Why? You sure? Are you sure?

1014
00:58:20,667 --> 00:58:21,958
I am sure!

1015
00:58:21,959 --> 00:58:23,626
Why so sure?

1016
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,958
If you don't believe me, ask her yourself?

1017
00:58:25,959 --> 00:58:27,916
If I can ask her myself,
then I don't need your help!

1018
00:58:27,917 --> 00:58:29,541
You asked her one more time!

1019
00:58:29,542 --> 00:58:31,541
Why didn't you ask me in the past?

1020
00:58:31,542 --> 00:58:34,250
Why are you saying this now?

1021
00:58:34,251 --> 00:58:36,125
I don't say this, then what should I say?

1022
00:58:36,126 --> 00:58:38,042
Didn't I ask you?

1023
00:58:38,292 --> 00:58:39,875
Deep throat smoked pork... what it is...

1024
00:58:39,876 --> 00:58:42,166
Hey... what are you talking about...
let's eat!

1025
00:58:42,167 --> 00:58:42,916
Yes, yes, let's eat

1026
00:58:42,917 --> 00:58:44,459
Leung, come here!

1027
00:58:45,167 --> 00:58:46,791
Dinner time!

1028
00:58:46,792 --> 00:58:47,667
It smells good!

1029
00:58:48,917 --> 00:58:52,626
Why here? This seat is better?

1030
00:58:53,209 --> 00:58:57,001
Wait! Wait! Let me get my phone

1031
00:58:57,334 --> 00:58:58,916
Let's take a picture first!
Let's take a picture first!

1032
00:58:58,917 --> 00:59:00,041
Oh... ok

1033
00:59:00,042 --> 00:59:00,959
How to turn it on?

1034
00:59:02,209 --> 00:59:06,334
Let me take a picture first! Ready?

1035
00:59:06,792 --> 00:59:07,791
Let me take a picture first!

1036
00:59:07,792 --> 00:59:10,834
Is it this chicken's birthday?

1037
00:59:11,667 --> 00:59:13,708
Sorry! Sorry! Let's have a picture

1038
00:59:13,709 --> 00:59:15,000
- Picture with the phoenix!
- Let me have the phone,

1039
00:59:15,001 --> 00:59:17,209
- let me have the phone!
- Come on, smiles!

1040
00:59:19,084 --> 00:59:19,916
You don't take a picture?

1041
00:59:19,917 --> 00:59:24,500
Hey together! C..H..E..E..R..S

1042
00:59:24,501 --> 00:59:27,541
one... two... three... ok

1043
00:59:27,542 --> 00:59:28,791
It's your turn, your turn

1044
00:59:28,792 --> 00:59:33,292
You take a picture for us,
come, take a picture for us

1045
00:59:34,667 --> 00:59:42,667
You stand in the middle, ok,
here we go, one... two... three...

1046
00:59:44,876 --> 00:59:46,500
- Is it ok?
- OK, ok.

1047
00:59:46,501 --> 00:59:48,166
The food is getting cold, let's eat

1048
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:52,417
OK, we took the most
important one, let's eat

1049
00:59:52,751 --> 00:59:56,333
Hey Ghost, have a mushroom

1050
00:59:56,334 --> 00:59:57,500
this is your favorite, here you go!

1051
00:59:57,501 --> 01:00:01,459
My favorite food is
chicken, you don't know me

1052
01:00:02,084 --> 01:00:06,126
Leung, have some mushrooms, here

1053
01:00:06,751 --> 01:00:09,709
I'll have the mushrooms, I love mushrooms

1054
01:00:10,167 --> 01:00:11,584
I love mushrooms too...

1055
01:00:11,751 --> 01:00:13,208
Isn't your favorite food chicken?

1056
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:15,667
I've just changed it, I love mushrooms

1057
01:00:26,209 --> 01:00:26,875
Good?

1058
01:00:26,876 --> 01:00:28,166
Yes, very good!

1059
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:30,417
You have one too, here, here

1060
01:00:31,042 --> 01:00:33,416
Here, here, don't be so fussy

1061
01:00:33,417 --> 01:00:35,042
Fine, quick quick quick!

1062
01:00:35,709 --> 01:00:38,084
Right Mei, how long have you known Ghost?

1063
01:00:41,751 --> 01:00:42,751
Around a month

1064
01:00:43,376 --> 01:00:46,042
Oh... a month...

1065
01:00:51,376 --> 01:00:52,625
Here, have some more

1066
01:00:52,626 --> 01:00:53,500
Again?

1067
01:00:53,501 --> 01:00:56,625
Keep going... please please

1068
01:00:56,626 --> 01:00:57,834
<i>OK...0k...</i>

1069
01:00:58,042 --> 01:01:01,084
Right Mei, what do you think about Ghost?

1070
01:01:06,042 --> 01:01:07,083
Very funny

1071
01:01:07,084 --> 01:01:09,584
Um... right? Very funny?

1072
01:01:14,792 --> 01:01:16,583
Hey... get some more

1073
01:01:16,584 --> 01:01:18,001
More again? Huh...

1074
01:01:19,917 --> 01:01:22,750
This is your birthday! Eat more

1075
01:01:22,751 --> 01:01:24,126
Sigh...

1076
01:01:24,501 --> 01:01:26,251
You two are...

1077
01:01:26,626 --> 01:01:27,958
Excuse me,

1078
01:01:27,959 --> 01:01:30,751
Sister Pui, I don't mean to upset you
on your birthday

1079
01:01:32,667 --> 01:01:34,542
But let me be clear about this,

1080
01:01:36,001 --> 01:01:39,417
Brother Ghost, I think you are
a very good person, funny too,

1081
01:01:42,959 --> 01:01:46,376
but, I don't like you,

1082
01:01:48,417 --> 01:01:50,126
I like someone else

1083
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:57,334
Sigh... everything is clear now

1084
01:01:58,126 --> 01:02:00,834
I go get a bottle of wine, let's drink

1085
01:02:04,167 --> 01:02:05,542
<i>I</i> 90 help you

1086
01:02:09,209 --> 01:02:11,126
You drink as much as you want tonight,

1087
01:02:11,584 --> 01:02:13,501
let's get drunk!

1088
01:03:21,209 --> 01:03:22,001
I want to get off!

1089
01:04:04,001 --> 01:04:05,626
Boss, I go first

1090
01:04:41,001 --> 01:04:42,084
What?

1091
01:04:42,501 --> 01:04:46,626
Boss, I have something to say

1092
01:04:46,876 --> 01:04:49,209
Fine, I got it...

1093
01:04:52,751 --> 01:04:57,167
She already said it, go find her

1094
01:04:59,001 --> 01:05:00,751
You shouldn't keep a woman waiting

1095
01:05:23,292 --> 01:05:24,334
Hello...

1096
01:05:24,959 --> 01:05:27,167
Hey... where are you now?

1097
01:05:27,459 --> 01:05:28,626
Why?

1098
01:05:29,834 --> 01:05:31,042
I come to you

1099
01:05:32,501 --> 01:05:34,667
I'll wait at the bridge
that you just got off,

1100
01:05:35,501 --> 01:05:36,834
I'll be there very soon

1101
01:05:59,751 --> 01:06:05,001
"Hurry Up, are you here yet?"

1102
01:06:54,001 --> 01:06:58,667
"Hurry Up, are you here yet?"

1103
01:07:24,626 --> 01:07:27,500
What's wrong? What's wrong?
He is gonna be fine

1104
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:30,291
What are you doing? Out!
Get out! Get the hell out!

1105
01:07:30,292 --> 01:07:31,772
- You get out!
- Sir, please calm down

1106
01:07:32,292 --> 01:07:34,708
Screw you! You are just a kid,
are you up to this?

1107
01:07:34,709 --> 01:07:36,500
Do you know how to save a life?

1108
01:07:36,501 --> 01:07:38,334
If you don't know, then
go get someone else!

1109
01:07:38,501 --> 01:07:40,250
- Go away!
- Sir, please calm down

1110
01:07:40,251 --> 01:07:42,333
Calm down? I told you to find someone else!

1111
01:07:42,334 --> 01:07:43,542
How can I calm down?

1112
01:07:44,042 --> 01:07:45,916
Sir, please calm down, the victim is dead

1113
01:07:45,917 --> 01:07:47,958
What the hell are you saying?

1114
01:07:47,959 --> 01:07:49,541
I am speaking to you! Dead?

1115
01:07:49,542 --> 01:07:53,001
Find someone else! Find someone else!

1116
01:08:04,001 --> 01:08:06,083
He is inexperienced,
he doesn't know what he is doing,

1117
01:08:06,084 --> 01:08:07,959
Look at him, such a freaking nerd

1118
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:11,459
Bring someone else, bring someone else!

1119
01:08:11,751 --> 01:08:13,391
Take it easy, let's the doctor handles it

1120
01:08:39,209 --> 01:08:40,709
My condolences

1121
01:08:42,417 --> 01:08:43,875
Fine, I don't need your condolences

1122
01:08:43,876 --> 01:08:46,708
Go get someone, arrest someone

1123
01:08:46,709 --> 01:08:48,792
I know who did it, it's Bill! Go get him

1124
01:08:48,834 --> 01:08:50,333
You just calm down first,
we will investigate

1125
01:08:50,334 --> 01:08:51,500
What to investigate? Go get him!

1126
01:08:51,501 --> 01:08:53,084
I told you to calm down!

1127
01:08:55,709 --> 01:08:56,500
Boss!

1128
01:08:56,501 --> 01:08:58,042
- Ghost, how's things?
- Damn it!

1129
01:08:58,167 --> 01:08:59,375
Ghost, are you alright?

1130
01:08:59,376 --> 01:09:02,708
How's Leung? You calm down first

1131
01:09:02,709 --> 01:09:03,583
Once I heard that something happened,

1132
01:09:03,584 --> 01:09:04,959
I get here immediately
to check you guys out

1133
01:09:05,126 --> 01:09:06,291
We are cousins,

1134
01:09:06,292 --> 01:09:07,500
- why would I kill Leung?
- Damn it!

1135
01:09:07,501 --> 01:09:08,834
You bastard!

1136
01:09:08,959 --> 01:09:10,500
- Are you done?
- Relax!

1137
01:09:10,501 --> 01:09:11,167
Relax!

1138
01:09:11,209 --> 01:09:13,001
Leave if you are done! Now!

1139
01:09:14,667 --> 01:09:15,333
No, I have to say something,

1140
01:09:15,334 --> 01:09:17,167
I said, I need to say something

1141
01:09:17,542 --> 01:09:18,958
You are dead to me! You are dead to me!

1142
01:09:18,959 --> 01:09:20,041
I am telling you, you are dead to me

1143
01:09:20,042 --> 01:09:21,709
Fine... fine... fine...

1144
01:09:23,667 --> 01:09:24,459
Let's go!

1145
01:09:26,501 --> 01:09:27,125
Sorry sir

1146
01:09:27,126 --> 01:09:28,458
I told you to leave

1147
01:09:28,459 --> 01:09:29,501
Fine... fine... fine...

1148
01:09:29,917 --> 01:09:32,334
You are going to pay for this

1149
01:09:32,792 --> 01:09:34,501
Watch out

1150
01:09:37,792 --> 01:09:39,251
I am speechless...

1151
01:09:41,167 --> 01:09:43,916
You see that? It's criminal intimidation,
go get them!

1152
01:09:43,917 --> 01:09:45,917
Don't you mess with me, go!

1153
01:09:46,459 --> 01:09:48,376
Damn it

1154
01:10:05,501 --> 01:10:06,250
Go!

1155
01:10:06,251 --> 01:10:07,001
Yes

1156
01:10:07,292 --> 01:10:09,709
B, where are you going to?

1157
01:10:09,917 --> 01:10:11,250
Hey, what are you going to do?

1158
01:10:11,251 --> 01:10:13,375
It's Bill that son of a
bitch who killed Leung!

1159
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:15,016
I am gonna get him and cut him in pieces!

1160
01:10:15,126 --> 01:10:18,334
By what? Just the two of you?

1161
01:10:18,501 --> 01:10:20,666
You don't even know where he is right now,

1162
01:10:20,667 --> 01:10:21,666
cut him in pieces?

1163
01:10:21,667 --> 01:10:24,709
Cut what? Pineapple? Watermelon?

1164
01:10:25,834 --> 01:10:29,709
He is going to pay for it, but not now

1165
01:10:30,917 --> 01:10:33,209
If we have money, we will have more people

1166
01:10:33,501 --> 01:10:35,542
If we have more people,
then we will be stronger

1167
01:10:36,751 --> 01:10:40,500
Ghost, why don't we sell this teahouse?

1168
01:10:40,501 --> 01:10:42,167
Then we have the fund

1169
01:10:43,251 --> 01:10:46,001
Leung would not approve
if we sell the teahouse

1170
01:10:46,376 --> 01:10:50,167
That's true, so what do you think?

1171
01:10:50,667 --> 01:10:52,751
Let's not do anything at this moment,

1172
01:10:53,126 --> 01:10:55,251
just focus on the teahouse first

1173
01:10:55,959 --> 01:11:00,501
Why don't you sell it?
I don't want to do it anymore

1174
01:11:02,376 --> 01:11:03,667
Then what do you want to do?

1175
01:11:04,834 --> 01:11:10,001
I know nothing and I am not good
at running a teahouse

1176
01:11:10,459 --> 01:11:12,001
I can't do it!

1177
01:11:15,709 --> 01:11:17,708
But your father spent his whole life
to build this

1178
01:11:17,709 --> 01:11:19,250
It is yours now, if it is not you,

1179
01:11:19,251 --> 01:11:22,292
I wouldn't invest, you have to keep it

1180
01:11:24,334 --> 01:11:26,041
I can't do it

1181
01:11:26,042 --> 01:11:27,834
You must do it even if you can't do it!

1182
01:11:31,751 --> 01:11:34,167
Everyone is just like a kid

1183
01:12:33,917 --> 01:12:35,126
Do we have enough bread?

1184
01:12:35,584 --> 01:12:37,167
Should be ok

1185
01:12:37,501 --> 01:12:38,667
Mei is back

1186
01:12:46,126 --> 01:12:46,750
Uncle Kwan

1187
01:12:46,751 --> 01:12:47,584
Back?

1188
01:12:59,209 --> 01:13:01,959
Getting any better after taking 3 days off?

1189
01:13:09,959 --> 01:13:14,917
A drink of tangerine and honey,
I made it, cheer up!

1190
01:13:19,251 --> 01:13:20,000
SQ?

1191
01:13:20,001 --> 01:13:20,876
Thanks

1192
01:13:40,084 --> 01:13:44,709
I haven't been here for a long time
yet still full of crowd

1193
01:13:49,376 --> 01:13:52,541
Ghost, I flied almost
24 hours to come back,

1194
01:13:52,542 --> 01:13:54,542
don't give me this look, ok?

1195
01:13:55,001 --> 01:13:58,834
No worries, I am here for you, relax

1196
01:14:16,792 --> 01:14:17,916
<i>Brother T a“!</i>

1197
01:14:17,917 --> 01:14:19,500
Bill!

1198
01:14:19,501 --> 01:14:22,959
It's been ages, how are you?

1199
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:24,922
- I am good, thank you
- When did you come back?

1200
01:14:25,001 --> 01:14:26,458
I came back last night

1201
01:14:26,459 --> 01:14:28,167
Why don't you give me a call to get you!

1202
01:14:28,501 --> 01:14:29,291
Say hello to Brother Tai!

1203
01:14:29,292 --> 01:14:30,417
<i>Brother T a“!</i>

1204
01:14:31,167 --> 01:14:32,792
What brings you back?

1205
01:14:33,542 --> 01:14:35,262
I wouldn't come back if it is not for Ghost

1206
01:14:36,501 --> 01:14:38,625
It has been ages, let's have a drink

1207
01:14:38,626 --> 01:14:41,334
Ok, here, cheers!

1208
01:14:42,667 --> 01:14:45,834
You two cousins, don't hang out together?

1209
01:14:46,251 --> 01:14:47,876
It's Ghost who doesn't go out!

1210
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:50,834
Hey, I got to go first

1211
01:14:51,084 --> 01:14:52,042
Oh?

1212
01:14:55,001 --> 01:14:58,125
Why? There is something between you two?

1213
01:14:58,126 --> 01:15:01,166
No, that's who Ghost is

1214
01:15:01,167 --> 01:15:03,667
Personality determines
one's destiny, that's it

1215
01:15:03,917 --> 01:15:07,750
Hahaha... you are in Peru,
it takes a long flight to be back,

1216
01:15:07,751 --> 01:15:09,001
you miss Hong Kong so much?

1217
01:15:10,167 --> 01:15:13,209
There are some clients of Ghost's
that want to cooperate with me,

1218
01:15:13,459 --> 01:15:15,459
that's why I am back

1219
01:15:16,417 --> 01:15:18,292
Ghost touches this stuff

1220
01:15:18,542 --> 01:15:21,875
Oh come on Bill, he doesn't?

1221
01:15:21,876 --> 01:15:24,667
I have been making some
money because of him!

1222
01:15:25,834 --> 01:15:29,167
That's great, come on, cheers!

1223
01:15:32,042 --> 01:15:33,417
How are you recently?

1224
01:15:34,042 --> 01:15:35,333
Find me some girls
and I will show you how I am lately

1225
01:15:35,334 --> 01:15:37,833
Cool! Let's go to my new place later

1226
01:15:37,834 --> 01:15:39,625
Hey sweetie, come and
accompany Brother Tai!

1227
01:15:39,626 --> 01:15:43,167
Come, come, come... Five, five

1228
01:15:43,751 --> 01:15:44,501
Fifteen

1229
01:15:44,667 --> 01:15:45,626
Fifteen, fifteen

1230
01:15:53,834 --> 01:15:55,501
Hey Brother Cheong!

1231
01:15:56,167 --> 01:15:58,042
Please have a sit

1232
01:15:58,626 --> 01:16:01,375
Ghost, he is here...

1233
01:16:01,376 --> 01:16:02,791
then we don't talk

1234
01:16:02,792 --> 01:16:07,167
No, we need to talk,
please sit down first, come, come

1235
01:16:09,834 --> 01:16:11,958
I have you two came here today

1236
01:16:11,959 --> 01:16:14,501
to discuss something

1237
01:16:15,584 --> 01:16:17,791
We all know that in the last few decades,

1238
01:16:17,792 --> 01:16:20,250
The real estate business
is getting bigger and bigger,

1239
01:16:20,251 --> 01:16:23,541
and our business is getting
smaller and smaller

1240
01:16:23,542 --> 01:16:26,291
So what I want to do today is
to discuss with you two,

1241
01:16:26,292 --> 01:16:30,167
how we can have our business...

1242
01:16:32,209 --> 01:16:33,333
strike back

1243
01:16:33,334 --> 01:16:34,751
What's your opinion Brother Cheong?

1244
01:16:38,042 --> 01:16:39,126
No?

1245
01:16:39,667 --> 01:16:40,626
Then Brother Fu?

1246
01:16:43,167 --> 01:16:46,001
Yes or No?

1247
01:16:50,292 --> 01:16:53,625
Hey come on, brothers, please say something

1248
01:16:53,626 --> 01:16:54,792
Yes or No?

1249
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:12,375
Next month is my birthday,

1250
01:17:12,376 --> 01:17:15,417
how about go to travelling together?

1251
01:17:15,834 --> 01:17:17,208
I havn't been on a vacation for so long

1252
01:17:17,209 --> 01:17:18,042
Boss!

1253
01:17:21,251 --> 01:17:22,292
Go!

1254
01:17:25,459 --> 01:17:27,584
There were two groups of people that went
to Ghost's teahouse for a talk

1255
01:17:27,792 --> 01:17:30,312
That bastard is calling people,
seems like there is something up

1256
01:17:31,792 --> 01:17:33,042
Go to the teahouse
and find out what's going on?

1257
01:17:33,209 --> 01:17:34,084
I'll go tomorrow

1258
01:17:34,292 --> 01:17:39,542
You go? Why you? I am a taxpayer

1259
01:17:42,584 --> 01:17:44,459
PHleave

1260
01:17:46,459 --> 01:17:49,209
You can leave too, we want to talk

1261
01:17:56,376 --> 01:17:57,250
Brother Two

1262
01:17:57,251 --> 01:17:58,001
Yes

1263
01:17:58,251 --> 01:18:00,126
There is something wrong

1264
01:18:01,126 --> 01:18:01,917
What's wrong?

1265
01:18:02,084 --> 01:18:03,667
It's Ghost

1266
01:18:05,251 --> 01:18:05,958
Ghost?

1267
01:18:05,959 --> 01:18:08,666
Yes, there is something different

1268
01:18:08,667 --> 01:18:10,876
He doesn't tell us what he is doing

1269
01:18:11,459 --> 01:18:15,126
Leung just died and he
is probably just upset

1270
01:18:15,334 --> 01:18:18,209
He never tells us what he plans to do

1271
01:18:18,459 --> 01:18:21,251
All these years, has he ever harmed you?

1272
01:18:21,417 --> 01:18:22,833
No...

1273
01:18:22,834 --> 01:18:28,709
That's right, brothers
have to trust each other

1274
01:18:29,417 --> 01:18:31,750
Brother Two, a new night
club just opens in Shen Zhen,

1275
01:18:31,751 --> 01:18:33,209
let's go some day

1276
01:18:33,501 --> 01:18:34,833
Who is the boss?

1277
01:18:34,834 --> 01:18:36,042
Me, I am in charge, what's the matter?

1278
01:18:36,209 --> 01:18:37,792
Police, ID card, thank you

1279
01:18:38,626 --> 01:18:39,542
Here is the warrant,

1280
01:18:40,042 --> 01:18:42,167
we have information saying
that there are drugs in this teahouse,

1281
01:18:42,376 --> 01:18:45,000
So we need to search this place,
please cooperate

1282
01:18:45,001 --> 01:18:47,126
- Sir, ID card
- It doesn't make any sense

1283
01:18:53,751 --> 01:18:56,083
Hey, how we gonna do business
with you people interrupting here

1284
01:18:56,084 --> 01:18:57,584
Please cooperate with the Police

1285
01:19:25,292 --> 01:19:27,959
I can help you to get
Bill charged with murder

1286
01:19:33,834 --> 01:19:35,626
Dare to work with me?

1287
01:19:43,417 --> 01:19:46,001
Sir, we found nothing

1288
01:19:46,917 --> 01:19:49,251
Give them back the ID cards, dismiss!

1289
01:19:57,584 --> 01:19:58,917
Sorry for the interruption

1290
01:20:11,126 --> 01:20:12,086
Hey, next time my treat.

1291
01:20:14,126 --> 01:20:14,917
Sorry

1292
01:20:21,292 --> 01:20:23,417
What are you doing lately?

1293
01:20:24,792 --> 01:20:28,042
We never touch this stuff,

1294
01:20:28,667 --> 01:20:30,416
you have to tell us honestly,

1295
01:20:30,417 --> 01:20:31,626
We are good brothers

1296
01:20:31,667 --> 01:20:32,916
Regardless if you are right or wrong,

1297
01:20:32,917 --> 01:20:34,833
B and I will fully support you

1298
01:20:34,834 --> 01:20:36,209
What the hell is going on?

1299
01:20:36,709 --> 01:20:38,083
You have said that Triad is already out

1300
01:20:38,084 --> 01:20:39,126
and it's time to do some real business,

1301
01:20:39,376 --> 01:20:41,375
Now the teahouse is getting on track

1302
01:20:41,376 --> 01:20:43,626
and you want to go back?

1303
01:20:43,876 --> 01:20:45,875
You are not young anymore,
you should think of yourself,

1304
01:20:45,876 --> 01:20:48,126
also think of your brothers too

1305
01:20:48,334 --> 01:20:52,167
Now you are having us all
involved, so tell me,

1306
01:20:52,584 --> 01:20:53,751
what the heck are you doing?

1307
01:20:56,167 --> 01:20:57,166
Hey?

1308
01:20:57,167 --> 01:20:58,125
Ghost!

1309
01:20:58,126 --> 01:20:59,042
Hey!

1310
01:20:59,251 --> 01:21:00,834
- Ghost!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

1311
01:21:08,626 --> 01:21:10,791
"I give my property (2) to Lee Lai Mei"

1312
01:21:10,792 --> 01:21:12,958
"I give my property (3) to Chan Yi"

1313
01:21:12,959 --> 01:21:15,126
"I give my property (4) to Wong Chi Hung"

1314
01:21:24,667 --> 01:21:30,376
I have made you some tangerines
and it should be enoug

1315
01:21:31,709 --> 01:21:33,251
That huge?

1316
01:21:34,209 --> 01:21:37,001
It should be enough for years, enjoy

Mr. Wong, your will is good now

1320
01:22:06,917 --> 01:22:08,197

Hello

1324
01:23:24,667 --> 01:23:26,042
Get photo?

1325
01:23:33,459 --> 01:23:37,751
The number you have dialed
is not available...

1326
01:23:41,584 --> 01:23:43,625
Uncle Two, Ghost took a funeral picture!

1327
01:23:43,626 --> 01:23:46,250
I couldn't reach him,
I am afraid something will happen to him

1328
01:23:46,251 --> 01:23:48,501
A funeral picture? Oh no

1329
01:23:58,834 --> 01:24:01,709
Detective Cheung! Detective Cheung!

1330
01:24:03,709 --> 01:24:04,834
Ghost might be in danger

1331
01:24:05,001 --> 01:24:06,500
We couldn't find him,

1332
01:24:06,501 --> 01:24:08,750
You really have to help us this time

1333
01:24:08,751 --> 01:24:09,791
Call the police if you have any problems!

1334
01:24:09,792 --> 01:24:11,958
Detective Cheung! It can't wait!

1335
01:24:11,959 --> 01:24:14,208
We are in an operation, get out of my way

1336
01:24:14,209 --> 01:24:15,750
Call the police and they will help you

1337
01:24:15,751 --> 01:24:17,625
Hey, you are just shirking us

1338
01:24:17,626 --> 01:24:19,334
You have to deal with this first

1339
01:24:19,959 --> 01:24:23,541
Detective Cheung,
we never get you in any troubles,

1340
01:24:23,542 --> 01:24:26,916
but this time, I am begging you,
you really need to help us

1341
01:24:26,917 --> 01:24:29,626
Get in the car! Get in the car!
We don't have time!

1342
01:24:54,126 --> 01:24:55,917
Detective Cheung, Ghost arrives

1343
01:24:56,667 --> 01:24:57,292
Copy!

1344
01:24:57,751 --> 01:25:01,126
Detective Cheung! Detective Cheung!
What's going on?

1345
01:25:17,917 --> 01:25:19,292
Ghost is here

1346
01:25:24,209 --> 01:25:28,251
What is he doing? Will he be ok?

1347
01:25:30,584 --> 01:25:33,542
I can help you to get
Bill charged with murder

1348
01:25:34,626 --> 01:25:38,751
If we are lucky, it would be the evidence
of him killing Leung

1349
01:25:39,626 --> 01:25:43,542
If not, that would be the evidence
of him killing me

1350
01:25:45,251 --> 01:25:47,084
Dare to work with me?

1351
01:25:50,334 --> 01:25:53,126
Don't worry! We have so many
policemen here, it will be fine

1352
01:26:00,042 --> 01:26:02,084
Detective Cheung, Bill arrives

1353
01:26:02,792 --> 01:26:03,584
Everyone stands by!

1354
01:26:19,709 --> 01:26:22,917
Brother Ghost, am I surprising you?

1355
01:26:23,209 --> 01:26:25,126
Nope, just right on time

1356
01:26:25,376 --> 01:26:27,876
I am always punctual,

1357
01:26:29,709 --> 01:26:31,208
no wonder why I offer you that much money

1358
01:26:31,209 --> 01:26:32,959
and you still refuse to sell me the shop

1359
01:26:33,084 --> 01:26:35,792
There you are with so
much stuff, by the way,

1360
01:26:36,209 --> 01:26:38,376
does your buyer trade in cash with you?

1361
01:26:38,584 --> 01:26:40,250
I have no idea that you
are really that greedy

1362
01:26:40,251 --> 01:26:43,583
Brother Ghost, it is just human nature,

1363
01:26:43,584 --> 01:26:45,083
I won't lie to myself

1364
01:26:45,084 --> 01:26:46,792
and I don't need your company

1365
01:26:48,834 --> 01:26:50,125
Ah!

1366
01:26:50,126 --> 01:26:53,292
Hey! Detective Cheung,
why don't you go catch them?

1367
01:26:53,376 --> 01:26:54,833
Someone is gonna get killed

1368
01:26:54,834 --> 01:26:57,042
You son of a bitch! Am I something now?

1369
01:26:57,334 --> 01:26:58,792
Hitting my head?

1370
01:27:01,042 --> 01:27:04,917
Hey! We ask you here to help,
not to watch a live show

1371
01:27:05,209 --> 01:27:07,251
Detective Cheung,
are you going to let my Boss dies?

1372
01:27:07,292 --> 01:27:08,333
Everyone calm down,

1373
01:27:08,334 --> 01:27:10,164
- I don't need you to
tell me how to do my job

1374
01:27:10,190 --> 01:27:11,279
- Are you out of your mind?

1375
01:27:18,126 --> 01:27:20,000
He will die if you don't take action now

1376
01:27:20,001 --> 01:27:22,333
lam warning you!
If you don't go out and rescue him

1377
01:27:22,334 --> 01:27:23,333
I will complain you and sue your ass

1378
01:27:23,334 --> 01:27:24,041
Let's go out

1379
01:27:24,042 --> 01:27:25,958
We have our plan, if we get him now,

1380
01:27:25,959 --> 01:27:28,125
It's just a serious assault
and he will only in jail for 12 years top

1381
01:27:28,126 --> 01:27:28,886
Bill hasn't started

1382
01:27:31,501 --> 01:27:36,084
We are cousins, why do
we have to be like this?

1383
01:27:36,292 --> 01:27:38,584
Why you have to put me
in such a difficult position?

1384
01:27:38,667 --> 01:27:41,334
We could be good if you could
just simply sell me the shop

1385
01:27:41,501 --> 01:27:43,208
WW gang up on me

1386
01:27:43,209 --> 01:27:44,750
for such tiny misunderstanding

1387
01:27:44,751 --> 01:27:46,917
What you policemen are thinking?

1388
01:27:46,959 --> 01:27:49,291
Hold hold hold, someone is dying

1389
01:27:49,292 --> 01:27:50,251
B, go!

1390
01:27:50,376 --> 01:27:51,209
Wait!

1391
01:27:51,292 --> 01:27:52,166
Get me off!

1392
01:27:52,167 --> 01:27:53,167
Hey!

1393
01:27:53,876 --> 01:27:55,001
Get me off!

1394
01:27:55,167 --> 01:27:56,407
Sir, are we going to stop them?

1395
01:27:56,751 --> 01:27:57,834
Hold it, hold it. Don't be reckless!

1396
01:27:58,042 --> 01:27:59,459
Why?

1397
01:28:00,292 --> 01:28:01,209
Give me the knife

1398
01:28:06,584 --> 01:28:07,542
This one is good

1399
01:28:42,917 --> 01:28:43,876
Hey! Are you ok?

1400
01:28:47,251 --> 01:28:49,583
Of course not! They outnumber us

1401
01:28:49,584 --> 01:28:51,751
Pick the most hideous one to kill!

1402
01:28:51,834 --> 01:28:52,709
0k!

1403
01:28:56,334 --> 01:28:58,125
Come here! Come here! Come here!

1404
01:28:58,126 --> 01:28:59,375
Get here! Don't you dare to get here!

1405
01:28:59,376 --> 01:29:00,876
You move, I kill!

1406
01:29:10,417 --> 01:29:13,251
You never change! You got my stuff dirty

1407
01:29:48,959 --> 01:29:50,084
You son of a bitch! Killing your brother

1408
01:29:50,209 --> 01:29:51,876
Did you kill Leung?

1409
01:29:56,001 --> 01:29:58,958
You jerk, yes I killed Leung,

1410
01:29:58,959 --> 01:30:00,916
I can kill you too!

1411
01:30:00,917 --> 01:30:03,917
Yes, I killed Leung,
what are you going to do with me?

1412
01:30:04,001 --> 01:30:04,792
Action!

1413
01:30:06,292 --> 01:30:07,417
I am gonna kill you too

1414
01:30:28,417 --> 01:30:29,751
Don't Move!

1415
01:30:29,792 --> 01:30:31,292
Police! Drop your weapons!

1416
01:30:32,876 --> 01:30:36,376
How you holding up? You
lost a lot of blood!

1417
01:30:36,667 --> 01:30:38,042
Don't die!

1418
01:30:38,209 --> 01:30:39,375
Who taught you
to hit someone's head with a bottle?

1419
01:30:39,376 --> 01:30:40,167
You

1420
01:30:40,501 --> 01:30:41,875
Me? Did I?

1421
01:30:41,876 --> 01:30:43,209
Hang on!

1422
01:30:44,667 --> 01:30:47,667
Ghost, hang on, the medic is coming

1423
01:30:49,459 --> 01:30:50,792
I am arresting you

1424
01:30:51,167 --> 01:30:53,458
for a murder of Ng Ka Leung,

1425
01:30:53,459 --> 01:30:54,375
You are not obliged to say
anything unless you...

1426
01:30:54,376 --> 01:30:56,042
What?

1427
01:30:57,001 --> 01:30:59,209
Why don't you arresst him?
He is trafficking drug!

1428
01:31:01,001 --> 01:31:04,417
Jackass, it's just flour!

1429
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:06,584
I am just ask Brother Tai back for vacation

1430
01:31:08,417 --> 01:31:09,542
Get him out of here!

1431
01:31:12,751 --> 01:31:15,209
Ghost! Ghost! Are you ok?

1432
01:31:15,917 --> 01:31:18,626
Luckily I am fat, I am ok

1433
01:31:19,126 --> 01:31:21,459
You scared me to death

1434
01:31:21,876 --> 01:31:23,375
I really need to run more,

1435
01:31:23,376 --> 01:31:24,791
- Of course you have to!
- I am out of breath!

1436
01:31:24,792 --> 01:31:26,376
Boss, it's ok now

1437
01:31:26,501 --> 01:31:29,417
B, didn't expect that you can still fight!

1438
01:31:30,001 --> 01:31:31,167
Yea...

1439
01:31:31,667 --> 01:31:32,959
Don't risk it another time

1440
01:31:33,459 --> 01:31:34,583
Still another time?

1441
01:31:34,584 --> 01:31:36,042
Are you out of your mind!

1442
01:31:36,167 --> 01:31:37,751
Hey, let's get him up

1443
01:31:38,792 --> 01:31:40,000
Where is the ambulance? Still not here?

1444
01:31:40,001 --> 01:31:41,416
On the way, on the way

1445
01:31:41,417 --> 01:31:42,792
Go check where the ambulance is!

1446
01:31:48,417 --> 01:31:51,083
Fresh and hot, $8 each

1447
01:31:51,084 --> 01:31:52,416
- Pineapple bun with pineapple
- Thank you, one?

1448
01:31:52,417 --> 01:31:57,626
Fresh out of oven! Fresh out of oven!

1449
01:32:01,876 --> 01:32:04,126
Excuse me...

1450
01:32:04,667 --> 01:32:06,208
- Good?
- Good

1451
01:32:06,209 --> 01:32:07,751
Of course, yes?

1452
01:32:07,834 --> 01:32:10,459
- Yes!
- Yes but why are you shaking you head?

1453
01:32:10,709 --> 01:32:11,791
It definitely would work!

1454
01:32:11,792 --> 01:32:14,125
And I am counting on you

1455
01:32:14,126 --> 01:32:16,166
We care a lot about the
spirit of cooperation,

1456
01:32:16,167 --> 01:32:17,792
I'll reserve the best bunch of eggs for you

1457
01:32:17,876 --> 01:32:21,084
If you open another shop,
remember to get the stock from us

1458
01:32:22,292 --> 01:32:27,125
But I hear that the powder
is getting very limited in the US,

1459
01:32:27,126 --> 01:32:28,417
Remember to save me some!

1460
01:32:28,501 --> 01:32:31,791
I am gonna to save you the best
bunch of flour! Definitely!

1461
01:32:31,792 --> 01:32:34,125
We have a deal!

1462
01:32:34,126 --> 01:32:34,875
Of course

1463
01:32:34,876 --> 01:32:36,541
As we are brothers, then no need to pay!

1464
01:32:36,542 --> 01:32:37,459
That's another issue

1465
01:32:41,959 --> 01:32:46,167
Hey Brother Ty, not going back to Peru?

1466
01:32:46,376 --> 01:32:46,958
No

1467
01:32:46,959 --> 01:32:48,251
Have a seat!

1468
01:32:50,084 --> 01:32:52,333
Even I have been backed
for just a few weeks,

1469
01:32:52,334 --> 01:32:53,291
but I am already loving it

1470
01:32:53,292 --> 01:32:55,083
Really? That's great

1471
01:32:55,084 --> 01:32:56,583
I am thinking to ask my
wife to come back too

1472
01:32:56,584 --> 01:32:58,041
Hey, let's have some food, ok?

1473
01:32:58,042 --> 01:32:58,834
- Ok...
- What do you want to eat?

1474
01:32:58,917 --> 01:33:00,875
I miss my egg tarts
