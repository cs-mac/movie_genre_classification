(CHRIS CRYING)

850
01:07:29,583 --> 01:07:31,166
What happened?
It's her knee.
I popped it back.

851
01:07:31,166 --> 01:07:32,625
I'll get some ice
and an Ace bandage.

852
01:07:36,291 --> 01:07:39,792
Don't you people have
a workout to finish?
What about it, huh?

01:07:49,792 --> 01:07:51,166
TINGLOFF:
Okay, how did it happen?

854
01:07:59,834 --> 01:08:04,250
I was just doing
that three-step
approach and...

855
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:05,625
(SIGHING)

856
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,333
And I went to take off
and my knee...
I don't know, it just...

857
01:08:12,333 --> 01:08:13,834
It just went.

858
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,375
And that's it?

859
01:08:18,041 --> 01:08:19,125
Well, yeah.

860
01:08:21,959 --> 01:08:22,834
Is that your mark?

861
01:08:28,458 --> 01:08:33,125
You know, jumping is
a fairly difficult,
complicated mental process.

862
01:08:34,959 --> 01:08:39,458
By comparison,
counting to three
is not so difficult.

One, two...

864
01:08:49,166 --> 01:08:51,709
Now how in the fuck
could you have
made a mistake like that?

865
01:08:53,875 --> 01:08:57,083
She didn't. I did.
I moved the mark.

866
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:00,083
You what?

867
01:09:00,083 --> 01:09:01,875
I was showing her
how to lengthen
her approach.

868
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:03,750
Oh.

869
01:09:04,834 --> 01:09:06,417
Any particular reason?

870
01:09:06,417 --> 01:09:08,709
Well, yeah.
To lower her...

871
01:09:08,709 --> 01:09:11,417
To lower what?
Her center of gravity.

872
01:09:16,542 --> 01:09:18,208
To lower her
center of gravity?

873
01:09:20,166 --> 01:09:21,667
She's got a long stride.

874
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:25,375
But that's too far.

875
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:27,875
I didn't mean for her
to try it here
on this shitty surface.

876
01:09:27,875 --> 01:09:29,875
Oh, then why did you move
her mark here?

877
01:09:29,875 --> 01:09:32,458
It was only a
couple of inches. It was...

878
01:09:32,458 --> 01:09:34,417
I thought...
You thought what?

879
01:09:34,417 --> 01:09:35,458
I mean, I...
Huh?

880
01:09:38,959 --> 01:09:40,875
It couldn't be
that far. I...

881
01:09:40,875 --> 01:09:42,583
I hope you
understand all this.

882
01:09:54,792 --> 01:09:56,625
You know I would do
anything to avoid
hurting you.

883

look at me?

play the dumb Indian
with me now.

Don't let him
do this to us.

01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:20,625
Do what?

What's he doing?
What did I do?

Spit it out for once
in your life.

889
01:10:28,959 --> 01:10:31,166
Did I do this
to you on purpose?

890
01:10:31,166 --> 01:10:33,792
Did I? Did I?

891
01:10:33,792 --> 01:10:35,625
Did I?

892
01:10:35,625 --> 01:10:37,583
You're so
fucking gutless.

893

Do you have a fucking
thought in your
fucking head?

894

both better off
with a dumb Indian.

before doing that.

01:48:28,917 --> 01:48:30,458
What are you gonna
do with this?

1353
01:48:37,375 --> 01:48:38,959
I hit a hurdle.

1354
01:48:38,959 --> 01:48:40,208
Fouled in the shot put.

1355
01:48:41,583 --> 01:48:43,417
I guess I've blown it.

1356
01:48:43,417 --> 01:48:44,542
You don't know that.

1357
01:48:47,291 --> 01:48:48,583
I had a fight with my coach.

1358
01:48:50,250 --> 01:48:51,583
He is...

1359
01:48:53,583 --> 01:48:55,542
Maybe he's right.

Killer instinct or whatever.

1362
01:49:05,125 --> 01:49:07,917
I think right now
you just need to

1363
01:49:07,917 --> 01:49:09,959
remember to look back
over your right shoulder.

1364
01:49:11,291 --> 01:49:12,959

more inches of arch.

to that bastard.

"whip everybody's ass."

01:49:23,125 --> 01:49:25,125
Hey, could you beat
Zenk in the shot?

1368
01:49:25,959 --> 01:49:27,417
Oh, come on.
Could you?

1369
01:49:29,291 --> 01:49:32,333
Well, you're not
responsible for
how good he is

1370

little bit better today

1373
01:49:41,792 --> 01:49:43,959
than you were yesterday,
day before.

1374
01:49:47,792 --> 01:49:49,917
All you're trying to do is
whip your own ass.

01:49:53,208 --> 01:49:54,792
That's about it.

1376
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,667

1377
01:50:01,667 --> 01:50:03,667
Today I won that 1,500.

1378
01:50:03,667 --> 01:50:05,125

At 6 feet even,
if she clears it,
it would be a personal best.

She's been training
in Germany, from the
University of Indiana.

1385

And she's got it.

Nearly flawless.

1400
01:51:38,083 --> 01:51:40,792
Except she hit the bar
with her calf coming down,

1401
01:51:40,792 --> 01:51:44,917
but it didn't drop.
Legal jump.

in the pentathlon long jump
has been delayed.

the rain has arrived here
in Eugene, Oregon,

1406

so we've got a delay
in the long jump.

1407
01:52:03,959 --> 01:52:05,000
Pooch Anderson,
she did have a good jump,

1408
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,458
though, solidly
in first place.

MAN 2 ON RADIO:
But she was very lucky.

1410
01:52:08,709 --> 01:52:10,625
She got her jump in
before it started to rain.

1411
01:52:10,625 --> 01:52:14,583
She's a speed jumper.
She may have been in trouble
if she'd had a wet runway.

1412
01:52:14,583 --> 01:52:17,667
MAN 1 ON RADIO:
Chris Cahill, she had her
PR in the high jump,

1413
01:52:17,667 --> 01:52:19,834
and she picked up
more than 100 points
on the field.

1414
01:52:19,834 --> 01:52:23,959

with another PR in the

That's what's so interesting
about the pentathlon is that

you can have someone
who falls down
at the beginning, really,

1417
01:52:29,083 --> 01:52:30,792
as she did in the hurdles.

1418
01:52:30,792 --> 01:52:33,083
And then she comes back
with personal records,

1419
01:52:33,083 --> 01:52:34,959

1421
01:52:42,166 --> 01:52:44,458
MAN 1 ON RADIO:
Charlene Benveniste,
her long jump was 19.10,

1422
01:52:44,458 --> 01:52:46,291
a little below her standard.

1423
01:52:46,291 --> 01:52:48,125
MAN 2 ON RADIO:
But she wasn't expecting
to do that well,

1424
01:52:48,125 --> 01:52:50,792
because she's only jumped
a little over 20 feet.

1425
01:52:50,792 --> 01:52:55,667
I think, the real story is
whether or not Tory Skinner
can catch her.

MAN ON PA:
Ed Tennant
to the long jump pit.

All right,
here is Tory Skinner.

1429
01:53:03,917 --> 01:53:06,500
The rain now has stopped,
but the runway
is still very slick.

1430

MAN 2 ON RADIO:
And I can't help but think

1431
01:53:08,291 --> 01:53:10,542
she's gonna have it in the
back of her mind
that the runway is wet,

1432
01:53:10,542 --> 01:53:13,333
because she is a speed jumper
and it is dangerous.

1433
01:53:13,333 --> 01:53:15,959
She has a chance
of catching
Charlene Benveniste

1434
01:53:15,959 --> 01:53:19,166
because she can jump
about a foot
further than Charlene.

1435
01:53:19,166 --> 01:53:21,875
MAN 1 ON RADIO:
All right.
Here's Tory Skinner.

1436
01:53:21,875 --> 01:53:24,208
This is the fourth
of five events
in the pentathlon.

1437

feet seem to be slipping
as she's coming down.

1438
01:53:35,083 --> 01:53:36,709
MAN 1 ON RADIO: Good height.

1439
01:53:36,709 --> 01:53:38,208
Distance is not that good.

1440
01:53:38,208 --> 01:53:41,041
MAN 2 ON RADIO: No.
She had good extension
and good height,

1441
01:53:41,041 --> 01:53:43,709
but she didn't have
the speed. It didn't carry
her far enough.

1442
01:53:43,709 --> 01:53:45,917
MAN 1 ON RADIO:
Her distance, 20'1".

1443
01:53:45,917 --> 01:53:49,333
So that means,
with now only
the 800 meters remaining,

1444
01:53:49,333 --> 01:53:51,542
Pooch Anderson
is in first place,

01:53:51,542 --> 01:53:54,000

is in second place,
right behind her.

is for third place now.

01:53:56,583 --> 01:53:58,834
MAN 1 ON RADIO:
Charlene Benveniste
is in third place,

1448
01:53:58,834 --> 01:54:02,125
but Tory Skinner is now
only five points behind her.

1449
01:54:02,125 --> 01:54:04,709
MAN 2 ON RADIO:
Charlene Benveniste, though
she is a very large woman,

1450
01:54:04,709 --> 01:54:08,125
actually has a better time
in the 800 meters than Tory.

1451
01:54:08,125 --> 01:54:10,959
So Tory is going to
have to beat Charlene

1452
01:54:10,959 --> 01:54:13,125

if she's going to
make the team.

01:54:20,750 --> 01:54:22,125
Her knee hyper-extended.
There's a little swelling,

1456

but, uh, nothing major.

1457
01:54:23,959 --> 01:54:26,208
Well, can she run?

1458
01:54:26,208 --> 01:54:28,458
Well, she says
she doesn't want to.
Excuse me.

Anyway, you
want an orange?
No, thanks.

1462
01:54:43,625 --> 01:54:45,125
How about a piece

1463
01:54:47,291 --> 01:54:48,917
How about a lude?

1464
01:54:53,917 --> 01:54:55,959
I watched your
long jump today.
It was really great.

1465
01:54:57,166 --> 01:54:59,291
You finally got that
extension at the end.

1466
01:54:59,291 --> 01:55:03,125
Charlene's gonna
go out fast.
No shit.

1467
01:55:03,125 --> 01:55:05,792
She knows I have to
beat her by four meters.

1468
01:55:05,792 --> 01:55:08,333
So she is really
going to push my knee.

1469
01:55:08,333 --> 01:55:10,458
Yeah. Well, she's not
going to go
any faster than me.

1470
01:55:12,625 --> 01:55:14,250
She's got no kick.
She'll die.

01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:18,000
So will you.
Don't do it.

1472

Nah.

01:55:32,333 --> 01:55:33,375

Hey.
Does it? Does it?

Does it bother you
that much?

And there's never
enough time.

1487
01:56:07,333 --> 01:56:08,583
And suddenly you realize,

01:56:10,375 --> 01:56:11,500
you have all the
time in the world.

01:57:40,667 --> 01:57:42,792
And, Charlie,
there are two races
within this race.

1511
01:57:42,792 --> 01:57:45,291
The first race is obviously
to make the Olympic team.

1512
01:57:45,291 --> 01:57:48,750
And Charlene Benveniste
and Tory Skinner
are virtually tied.

1513
01:57:48,750 --> 01:57:51,000
They're really gonna
have to watch each other.

1514
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:54,125
Tory's gonna have to
beat Charlene if she
wants to make the team.

1515
01:57:54,125 --> 01:57:56,750
The second race is
between Pooch Anderson
and Chris Cahill.

1516
01:57:56,750 --> 01:57:59,000
Chris is a better
800 meter runner.

1517
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,458
She could actually
beat Pooch Anderson
and win this event.

In lane five, from Berkeley,
is Kim Stone.

In lane six, Pooch Anderson.

1529
01:58:33,667 --> 01:58:35,667
She's been leading
throughout the competition.

1530
01:58:35,667 --> 01:58:39,959
And in lane seven
is Tory Skinner.
She's in fourth place.

1531
01:58:39,959 --> 01:58:42,500
Eight hundred meters,
this is two laps around
the 400-meter track.

Chris Cahill,
going out very quickly.

1537
01:58:59,208 --> 01:59:02,375
And going right with her
is Charlene Benveniste.

1538
01:59:02,375 --> 01:59:05,834
So it is Cahill and Benveniste
taking the early lead.

MAN 2 ON RADIO:
And Charlie, you would think

1540
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:08,583
that Chris Cahill
would run conservatively

1541
01:59:08,583 --> 01:59:10,458
and just try to
make the Olympic team.

1542
01:59:10,458 --> 01:59:14,375
The only thing I can
think of is that, for these
runners, this is Moscow.

01:59:14,375 --> 01:59:18,166
There will be no
Olympic games, and she's
trying to win the event.
