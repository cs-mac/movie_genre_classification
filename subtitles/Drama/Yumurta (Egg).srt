1
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,800
Fire!

2
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,730
Hurry! Hurry!

3
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,120
All right! Heave!

4
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,290
Storm the fortress! Go!

5
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,270
A reward awaits whoever brings me the general's head!

6
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,210
See you!

7
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:34,940
Wait!

8
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,720
That's Bazuso!

9
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,850
Bazuso, who slayed thirty men by himself?

10
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,800
The one who wrestled down a bear?

11
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,990
What is it?

12
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:57,090
Step forth if you want your head split!

13
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,490
What is the meaning of this?

14
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,120
Take him down and make a name for yourself!

15
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,070
You go!

16
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,680
No, you!

17
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,240
He's out of my league.

18
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,020
These useless mercenaries!

19
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,200
Aye.

20
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,090
Their balls have shrunk to the size of nuts!

21
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,050
Everyone!

22
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,020
Have no mercy here!

23
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,440
Gouge out their eyes and drape them in their guts!

24
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,630
Then feed them to the pigs!

25
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,050
Who's that?

26
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,960
He's still a kid.

27
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,260
Who does he answer to?

28
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,520
Look at his sword.

29
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,790
He's just showing off.

30
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,850
In the end he'll just get his head split.

31
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,200
His enemy is Bazuso, you know?

32
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,490
Ten coins.

33
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,640
What?

34
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,470
The price for killing that iron freak.

35
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:03,520
We're mercenaries. We don't live off honor like knights do.

36
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,820
How dare you insult Bazuso...

37
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,600
Should you prove reliable.

38
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,280
Very well.

39
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,910
If you slay him true to your word, then seven silver coins are yours come morning.

40
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,250
You're a stingy one.

41
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,460
All right then.

42
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,300
You're going to regret this, boy.

43
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,940
Are you so eager to risk your life for seven silver coins?

44
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,820
He's so fast!

45
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,260
Look! He has Bazuso on the defensive!

46
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:50,910
What's going on?

47
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,940
I've never seen him like this.

48
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,910
Who is that?

49
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,070
Shit!

50
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,980
Don't be too full of yourself!

51
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,300
Withhold your blade!

52
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,690
Your skills have earned you my utmost admiration—

53
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,000
Bazuso...

54
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,140
Now!

55
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,380
The enemy's morale is broken!

56
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,830
Charge!

57
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,970
Seems like we've found ourselves a capable one here.

58
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,220
I wonder who he's with.

59
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,100
This isn't the time to be in awe.

60
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,310
He stole all our momentum.

61
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,340
Take it up with our dim-witted general then.

62
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,510
It's not our fault.

63
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,320
Hey, Griffith.

64
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,180
Who do you think is stronger between you two?

65
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,380
Don't be absurd.

66
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,890
Griffith of course.

67
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,730
Egg of the High King

68
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,640
Egg of the High King

69
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,650
Egg of the High King

70
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,120
Okay, next.

71
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,920
This is your wage for two months' work, plus the reward.

72
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,830
Hey, want to rethink it?

73
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,130
I'll triple your wage.

74
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:20,800
The clerk said I could hire you as a knight.

75
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:26,820
That's a dream come true for mercs like us.

76
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,020
Dreams?

77
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,900
Can you eat those?

78
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,590
Wait!

79
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:43,350
I'm offering you social standing and money!

80
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,990
What more could you want?

81
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,010
I don't want to be tied down.

82
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,960
Next!

83
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,360
Bandits, huh?

84
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,120
Okay! Attack!

85
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,740
Fuck!

86
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,720
Look!

87
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,710
This bastard's the real deal!

88
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,580
Look, he's wiping the floor with them.

89
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,590
What do we do?

90
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:21,570
He's got Corkus scared out of his wits.

91
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:24,040
To be fair, that guy's monstrously strong.

92
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,050
Yeah.

93
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,270
His victory over Bazuso wasn't a fluke.

94
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,600
What now?

95
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,900
I told them.

96
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,940
Go, Casca.

97
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,980
Why? This was Corkus' idea.

98
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:40,530
Fine.

99
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,460
You go!

100
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,070
Why me? This was your stupid idea!

101
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,350
Shit!

102
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,320
Come back you idiot!

103
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,200
No!

104
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,050
Fall back!

105
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,460
I'm sorry!

106
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,230
That sword is huge.

107
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:34,410
A woman?

108
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,410
Eat this!

109
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,630
Our Casca is being driven back!

110
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,380
You kidding me?

111
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,420
I'm finished.

112
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,590
Griffith!

113
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,480
Be careful!

114
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,750
He's skilled!

115
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,410
Griffith...

116
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,930
And this is your last day.

117
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,890
Do it, Griffith.

118
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,260
Will you sheathe your sword?

119
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,290
Guess not.

120
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,110
So fast.

121
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:51,880
Shit...

122
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,830
Sweet mother.

123
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,210
He only needed a single strike.

124
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,920
Gri... ffith...

125
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,080
Hey!

126
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:13,940
What's going on here?

127
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,720
Where am I?

128
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,110
Why are you here?

129
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,460
Griffith should have killed you when he had the chance!

130
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,720
You...

131
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,110
This one's for my horse!

132
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:49,190
Shit...

133
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,190
That bitch...

134
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,120
Okay!

135
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,680
You ought to thank Casca.

136
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,610
You'd lost a lot of blood and a deathly chill gripped you,

137
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,920
so she shared your bed to keep you warm for two days and two nights.

138
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,840
What?

139
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,190
Griffith told her to.

140
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,890
He said it's a woman's duty to warm the man.

141
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,690
Looking for trouble, Judeau?

142
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,040
Sorry, sorry.

143
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,850
Seems you're up and well.

144
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,800
Good morning, Griffith.

145
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,210
I'm Griffith.

146
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,300
What's your name?

147
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,470
Guts.

148
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,590
An impressive sword.

149
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,150
I wouldn't be able to swing it.

150
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,650
Will you walk with me?

151
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,200
Hey, Griffith.

152
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,740
Griffith.

153
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:37,880
Hey!

154
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,630
Well aren't you the popular one?

155
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,430
Hey...

156
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,890
Excellent.

157
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,310
That bastard...

158
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,000
Has he risen from the grave already?

159
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,420
Griffith.

160
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,730
What a peculiar atmosphere.

161
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,400
Where am I?

162
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,070
We're the Band of the Hawk.

163
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,910
Do you know us?

164
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,150
Yes.

165
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:11,410
You're one of the mercenary troupes no one wants to face on the battlefield.

166
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,990
You gave us a really hard time during that siege.

167
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,870
I see. Those were these people, huh?

168
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:19,820
Yes.

169
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,300
We're the Band of the Hawk.

170
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,750
I like the view.

171
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,000
Why?

172
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,650
Why did you avert your slash?

173
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,400
You could've easily killed me.

174
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:54,120
Because I want you, Guts.

175
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,670
Is that where your interests lie?

176
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,620
I saw your duel with Bazuso.

177
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,250
You were splendid.

178
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:10,680
It was a close call, though.

179
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:15,300
If his battle axe hadn't cracked,

180
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,940
your brains would've been the ones splattered in the dirt.

181
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,630
Sure would.

182
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:27,960
You're an honest soul.

183
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,410
The way you fight seems to me...

184
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,330
like you want to test whether you're truly alive.

185
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:39,390
It looks to me as if you purposely push yourself within an inch of your life

186
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:42,210
only to come back struggling tooth and nail.

187
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,990
That's the feeling I get.

188
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,550
You are an interesting one.

189
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,810
I want you, Guts.

190
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,790
And if I refuse?

191
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,400
Will you?

192
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,130
Absolutely!

193
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,060
You, pretending to know it all...

194
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,970
Big words for someone

195
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,280
who almost killed me!

196
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,540
Let's settle it!

197
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:24,470
If I win, I'll give you a gash in the chest to match my own.

198
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,130
And if I win?

199
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:31,380
You can make me your soldier or your whore. I don't care.

200
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,060
Very well.

201
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,840
Brute force appeals to me.

202
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,370
Griffith.

203
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:49,650
Don't interfere, Casca.

204
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,200
But...

205
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,910
I will get what I want.

206
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:58,910
I can't stomach that conceited attitude!

207
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,540
Fuck!

208
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,550
Hey, look!

209
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,640
That bastard's at it again!

210
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,180
Don't interfere!

211
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,270
Griffith's orders!

212
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,440
We can postpone this.

213
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:24,740
Your wounds haven't healed yet.

214
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,650
You're at a disadvantage.

215
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,520
Shut up!

216
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:29,690
Griffith!

217
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:30,650
Foul play!

218
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,960
You'll do anything to win.

219
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,250
This is getting increasingly interesting.

220
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,570
But you can't use your sword.

221
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,560
What now?

222
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,310
You can yield.

223
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:55,140
You talk too much.

224
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:59,890
Let me show you how to use your mouth in battle!

225
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,810
Griffith!

226
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,370
How do you like the taste of your own blood?

227
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:23,330
First time someone hit you?

228
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:31,140
Sorry your henchmen have to see this.

229
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,130
This is the end!

230
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,710
All right!

231
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,680
He's won!

232
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,440
You did well.

233
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,730
But this is it.

234
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,390
Will you yield?

235
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:52,650
Or would you prefer to have your shoulder dislocated?

236
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:54,440
Pick.

237
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,950
Asshole!

238
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,910
Okay!

239
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,860
Serves you right!

240
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,900
Now you belong to me.

241
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,100
<i>He's never said that.</i>

242
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:33,520
<i>Griffith has never said that to anyone before.</i>

243
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:47,680
So now I'm a member of the Band of the Hawk too, huh?

244
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,090
Guts, you will work for me.

245
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,460
You will work for what is important to me.

246
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,630
I will have my own country.

247
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,730
I will decide where you die, Guts.

248
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:32,540
Three Years Later

249
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,800
Maintain formation!

250
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:44,040
Show the dogs of Tudor the pride of Midland!

251
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,180
Don't let them escape!

252
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,860
Kill all that move!

253
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:21,560
The Black Sheep Iron Spears Heavy Knights are truly horrific.

254
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,260
Our forces are taking heavy casualties.

255
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,500
This command post will soon be endangered.

256
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,210
Where are they?

257
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:39,660
They who will defeat the black devils of Tudor...

258
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:41,940
Charge!

259
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,990
The Black Sheep Iron Spears Heavy Knights will take the Midland king's head!

260
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,730
How preposterous!

261
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:56,630
A single horseman against us?

262
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,550
Very well!

263
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,130
I shall trample you into the dust!

264
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:17,150
Ridiculous!

265
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,110
General Gien was slain in a single slash!

266
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,320
The enemy is alone!

267
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:28,830
Surround him!

268
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:30,830
But...

269
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,250
An attack from our rear?

270
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,430
That's...

271
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,380
The Band of the Hawk!

272
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,310
The reapers of the battlefield.

273
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,090
Why are they with Midland?

274
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:09,360
The Tudor army is on the retreat.

275
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,030
What a farce.

276
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:14,000
The tides of battle are not turned by a single mercenary.

277
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,720
The Band of the Hawk exceeds expectations.

278
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,680
Indeed. They have proven their money's worth.

279
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,900
They simply profited from the element of surprise.

280
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,600
You're giving them too much credit.

281
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,430
You cannot debate the fact that they defeated the invincible Black Sheep.

282
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,280
Their subsequent attack was extremely skillful.

283
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,370
They read the enemy's movements.

284
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:35,410
Both...

285
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,440
What is their leader called?

286
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,210
Griffith, Your Majesty.

287
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:45,760
Griffith...

288
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,990
Guts!

289
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:15,420
You were amazing, Guts!

290
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:19,230
You show-off, charging in by yourself.

291
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,710
Sorry. I rode off without permission.

292
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,260
Too afraid to stop and think.

293
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,450
It doesn't suit the commander.

294
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,600
Where are you going? We won.

295
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,930
Let's go drink to victory.

296
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:42,510
Yeah, let's.

297
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:44,110
Let's all drink!

298
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,250
Women!

299
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,240
Call some women!

300
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,580
Tonight, I'm getting wasted!

301
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,960
All right!

302
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,050
Follow me!

303
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,060
Why are you in charge, Corkus?

304
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,120
Guts is the one who saved the day.

305
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,560
Let's stick to custom.

306
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,160
Guts.

307
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,640
We need to talk.

308
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,700
Will you come with me,

309
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,290
<i>Commander?</i>

310
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:11,080
What were you trying to do out there?

311
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:12,810
What do you mean?

312
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,160
Don't play dumb.

313
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,000
Your job was to divert the enemy, nothing more.

314
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,750
Instead, you rushed ahead of your comrades and charged into the enemy ranks by yourself.

315
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,420
That might work sometimes,

316
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:29,550
but your ego could end up endangering the entire Band!

317
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,380
Mind your position!

318
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,340
Sorry.

319
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,570
I'll be more careful from now.

320
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,390
You haven't changed.

321
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,790
Those are just empty promises.

322
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:44,400
You haven't changed at all over the last three years.

323
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,720
All you want is to swing that sword of yours around the battlefield.

324
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,160
You don't spare a single thought for your comrades!

325
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,950
You're just a mad dog!

326
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,450
You're wrong!

327
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:00,240
I'm no longer my old self!

328
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:05,190
I'm do think about my comrades.

329
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:07,390
Drop it, you two.

330
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,470
Griffith!

331
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:12,760
I'll tell him myself.

332
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,280
You're too soft on him.

333
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,930
You two really don't get along.

334
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:32,880
It's not my fault!

335
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,350
She always attacks me.

336
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,810
Yes, perhaps, but it's been three years already.

337
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,560
Get along, you two.

338
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,280
Three years, huh?

339
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,400
Yeah.

340
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,260
Three years since our duel.

341
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,410
That fight was fun.

342
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,270
That's how fighting ought to be like.

343
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,720
Let's go, then.

344
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,150
You've got people drinking to your name this evening.

345
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,200
Griffith...

346
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,340
I'm sorry about today's battle.

347
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:18,220
Fight for me, Guts.

348
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,790
You belong to me.

349
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,860
Have you heard about the man Griffith?

350
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,970
Yes. A truly alarming state of affairs.

351
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:48,840
It's true that since we have recruited the Band of the Hawk, we have been undefeated.

352
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,980
They are mercenaries.

353
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,040
Money is their only master.

354
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,240
During peacetime, they are no more than common bandits.

355
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:00,780
To praise men like them to the sky would be a foolish idea.

356
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,080
Verily. They belong in the gutter.

357
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:06,660
Handle them incorrectly and they will be nothing but trouble.

358
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:12,060
But if we hadn't employed them, Tudor would surely have burned us to the ground.

359
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,170
True.

360
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:17,570
Besides, I understand His Majesty's willingness in this matter.

361
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:19,760
That may be so, but—

362
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,120
Aye.

363
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,640
That may be so, but elevating a commoner to nobility is just not acceptable.

364
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,950
His Majesty is too whimsical.

365
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:33,060
I'm given to understand the Band of the Hawk was granted the honor of the vanguard in the last battle.

366
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:33,710
What?

367
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,420
Then what about Count Julius and his White Dragon Knights?

368
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,200
Relieved of their post, presumably.

369
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,430
Were Tudor to hold His Majesty captive, surely would they demand an exorbitant ransom.

370
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,430
The enemy, Lord Vodais, has died on the field.

371
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:06,570
Guts' column is still fighting the remnants of his army.

372
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,850
He seems to have unusual difficulty with them.

373
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,580
I didn't expect the fortress to be this difficult to take.

374
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,920
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

375
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,720
Well...

376
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,250
Someone said there's a huge treasure inside.

377
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:28,090
We heard screams in quick succession.

378
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,370
All the ones who went to check...

379
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,800
Whatever! I'll go.

380
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,870
Let go, Gaston!

381
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,960
Let me ask Griffith's generals for support, then.

382
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:39,480
Do that and I'll kill you.

383
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,110
Commander!

384
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:42,450
Don't follow me.

385
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,970
What happened to these corpses?

386
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,230
What on Earth...

387
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,370
Zodd the Immortal?

388
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:02,320
Yeah.

389
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,220
It seems he's come to bolster the enemy lines for this battle.

390
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,610
You mean Zodd the legendary mercenary?

391
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:13,850
They say the number of people he's killed could populate an entire country.

392
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:17,190
Zodd isn't feared simply because he's powerful.

393
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:22,150
Songs have been sung of his deeds for two hundred years now.

394
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,280
Two hundred years?

395
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:30,270
That's the reason they're calling him the Immortal.

396
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,330
So strong... Too strong.

397
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,400
My praise to you, boy.

398
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,340
It is rare indeed that I should exchange blows with someone for so long.

399
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:43,000
I see.

400
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:49,030
Our swordsmanship is at least on par.

401
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,660
Splendid.

402
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,960
Never has one targeted my sword.

403
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:27,210
You are the first man to bury his blade this deep in my flesh.

404
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,030
I am delighted.

405
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:40,350
Perhaps I have lived all these three hundred years merely

406
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,980
so that I would meet a foe such as you.

407
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:54,990
Impossible.

408
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,780
These kinds of monsters shouldn't exist.

409
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,990
Fight me!

410
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:10,550
Do not disappoint me.

411
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:24,190
Is this the extent of your power?

412
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,630
No.

413
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:29,320
For a human it has been most astounding.

414
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,980
Is that Zodd?

415
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,510
Focus!

416
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:39,500
Second row!

417
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:41,710
Fire!

418
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,260
Feel my wrath!

419
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:57,500
Who dares abase my battle?

420
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,730
Run! Run!

421
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,230
Casca! Lead the retreat!

422
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,760
Griffith will... fight him?

423
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,640
Guts.

424
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,510
You idiot...

425
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,500
Why did you come?

426
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,880
Voice your complaints after we've escaped.

427
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:29,000
Fight me!

428
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,910
Fight me until your limbs decorate the walls!

429
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,310
Oh, shit!

430
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,090
Griffith!

431
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,720
Can you move?

432
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:42,170
We're dead if I can't.

433
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,420
You take the left.

434
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:44,370
Now!

435
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:00,410
Guts! We have to run for it right now!

436
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,210
Griffith!

437
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:13,620
How fortuitous that I should meet two men that could wound me on the same day,

438
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:17,970
and how deplorable that I should lose them both so soon thereafter.

439
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,290
Stop!

440
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,650
He's my...

441
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:27,940
My...

442
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:34,260
Farewell, human.

443
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:39,090
It cannot!

444
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:41,730
The Egg of the High King...

445
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:46,460
Why is the Crimson Behelit here?

446
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,370
I see.

447
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:56,470
I see what artifice this is.

448
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:07,490
A warning, boy.

449
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:09,630
Nay, a prophecy.

450
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:16,390
If you consider yourself a true friend of this man,

451
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:18,900
then prepare yourself.

452
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:22,570
When the designs of this man come to naught,

453
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:25,820
death will come for you.

454
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,380
A death you cannot possibly escape!

455
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:44,340
What is that?

456
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,930
A demon?

457
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:48,950
What was that?

458
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:55,140
But otherwise...

459
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:56,900
True friend?

460
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:58,590
My death?

461
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,710
It makes no sense.

462
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,350
What was he saying?

463
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:04,530
Come to it, Griffith!

464
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:09,540
Griffith, are okay?

465
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:10,440
Don't come closer!

466
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,750
It's your fault this happened to Griffith.

467
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,520
It's your fault!

468
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:43,680
You haven't changed at all over the last three years.

469
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:46,450
You're just a mad dog!

470
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:53,080
It's your fault this happened to Griffith.

471
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,920
It's your fault!

472
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:56,500
Shit.

473
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,810
What's her deal?

474
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:04,640
Don't be upset.

475
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,640
You got hit much worse than I did, yet look at you.

476
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:13,980
You're a stone of a man.

477
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,110
Nosferatu Zodd?

478
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,480
I find his existence less than humorous.

479
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,590
If you look at it another way,

480
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:31,810
it's proof there are creatures in this world that the human intellect cannot fathom.

481
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:35,790
Gods, perhaps.

482
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,070
Don't you mean devils?

483
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:41,400
Same thing.

484
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:43,880
Oh, right.

485
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,840
That thing you always have dangling around your neck.

486
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,130
That monster, you know...

487
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:54,210
It flew off when it saw that.

488
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,000
What is it?

489
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:58,600
A behelit.

490
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:01,830
I got it from a old fortune teller a long time ago.

491
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:12,280
Those who wear it are destined to hold the world in their grasp in return for their own flesh and blood.

492
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,000
The world, huh?

493
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:41,070
You have a terrible sense of humor.

494
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:42,480
Don't startle me like that.

495
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:48,990
I liked it.

496
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:55,620
That part of you will never change.

497
00:46:57,830 --> 00:46:59,000
Nothing about me

498
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:00,930
will ever change.

499
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:09,930
Why?

500
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:14,350
I'm no more to you than any of your other soldiers.

501
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:15,600
Why come save me?

502
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:23,600
No reason in particular.

503
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:29,230
Do I need a reason every time I risk my life for you?

504
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,410
No, I...

505
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:45,560
Have your wounds already healed?

506
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,300
Your Majesty.

507
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:00,480
Hey, Guts.

508
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,040
You are in the presence of the king!

509
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:03,480
Show due respect!

510
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:16,990
Very well.

511
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:18,510
Raise your heads.

512
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,270
Lord Griffith.

513
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:25,420
Your Band of the Hawk has performed as admirably as always.

514
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,320
You honor me.

515
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:31,170
Your Majesty, offering such praise to who may as well be a newcomer is unheard of.

516
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:33,940
What harm is there in doing so?

517
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:41,560
It is undeniable that among the high nobility there is considerable disdain for those of low birth.

518
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:46,060
However, social status and dignity do not win wars.

519
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:50,940
Instead, I have chosen to put my hopes in you, whose abilities excel in that domain.

520
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:53,970
I am undeserving of such praise.

521
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:56,280
Words fail me to express my gratitude.

522
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,040
Who is the girl I see?

523
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:07,860
She is my daughter, Charlotte.

524
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:12,770
She dislikes stern men of arms, and has seldom left the castle.

525
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:15,000
Charlotte.

526
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,660
She is my only daughter, and I fear I have spoiled her.

527
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,020
Forgive me, Lord Griffith.

528
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:28,230
Let us go, Charlotte.

529
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,220
Are you unhurt?

530
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,450
My apologies.

531
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,710
Please be careful.

532
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:05,690
Um...

533
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:12,940
How dare you tarnish the princess' chastity so!

534
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:17,740
Listen, you old asshole!

535
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:24,250
I apologize for my transgression, Your Excellency.

536
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:28,110
That should be enough.

537
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,010
Now, princess.

538
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:31,760
Your father awaits you.

539
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,400
Yes, dear uncle.

540
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:57,470
Hey, why do we have to take part in this highborn pastime?

541
00:50:58,380 --> 00:50:59,570
Ridiculous.

542
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,880
This is also part of the job.

543
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,290
Doesn't this beat leading a sortie on the battlefield?

544
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:12,350
Chances are that you won't end the day full of arrows or missing half of your face.

545
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:17,790
This one agrees with me.

546
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:20,620
You're no more than a killer.

547
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:22,310
Corkus, what are you...

548
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:23,490
Shut it!

549
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:27,790
Until now, only highborn knights were trusted to escort the king's hunt.

550
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:29,870
We should be honored.

551
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:35,540
All these years of toiling through the mud of the battlefield for this very purpose.

552
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:38,320
And you call it ridiculous?

553
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,900
Corkus!

554
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:44,850
If you want to swing your sword around that much, then do it alone, you brainless butcher.

555
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:55,730
Would you not call all this exceedingly exquisite?

556
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,730
We shall speak later.

557
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,980
Do you dislike the hunt?

558
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:28,050
The enjoyment men find in spilling blood leaves me perplexed.

559
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:29,800
During hunt and war both...

560
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:35,970
Oh, my!

561
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:46,720
Do this, my princess.

562
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:07,900
Your Excellency.

563
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:08,590
Wait.

564
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:10,080
Bide your time.

565
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,830
Hey! It went that way!

566
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:12,710
Corner it!

567
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,020
Please, stop!

568
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,580
Have no fear!

569
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:55,160
Calm down!

570
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:02,050
Are you hurt?

571
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:11,810
What is wrong?

572
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:15,390
I was so afraid!

573
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:17,980
My heart is still galloping.

574
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,220
I'm so...

575
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,860
We ought to have paid more attention.

576
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:30,520
Let us return.

577
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:32,710
The others are worried.

578
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:34,960
Griffith!

579
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:37,550
Griffith!

580
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:40,960
Guts!

581
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,080
Griffith!

582
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:58,100
Shit!

583
00:54:58,380 --> 00:54:59,060
Griffith!

584
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:01,360
Hey, Princess!

585
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:03,770
What the hell happened?!

586
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:05,860
Where did the bolt come from?

587
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:06,820
This hurts...

588
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,310
Griffith!

589
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:09,420
Griffith...

590
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,700
Don't cry, Casca.

591
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:15,910
Griffith.

592
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:20,730
What about the bolt?

593
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:23,380
Don't touch it.

594
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:25,920
It's probably coated in poison.

595
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:27,760
But then...

596
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,010
No.

597
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:31,970
This shielded me.

598
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:36,020
The Egg of the High King.

599
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:37,340
Are you kidding?

600
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:39,160
You had that?

601
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:40,900
You're so lucky.

602
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:42,840
Unbelievable.

603
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,510
This is no ordinary stroke of luck.

604
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:45,940
This is a miracle.

605
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:51,750
I'll follow them through the thicket over there.

606
00:55:54,410 --> 00:55:55,390
Griffith,

607
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,730
take off your armor.

608
00:55:58,150 --> 00:55:59,410
We need to check for wounds.

609
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:14,890
This poison...

610
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:17,860
was expensive.

611
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,260
Really?

612
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:38,830
What are you doing?

613
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:44,600
Do you think you are fit for the White Dragon Knights with that kind of swordsmanship?

614
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:45,870
We're done here!

615
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,690
Father! I can still...

616
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:54,090
Adonis, my Lord.

617
00:56:54,090 --> 00:56:55,960
We need to bandage your wounds.

618
00:56:56,710 --> 00:57:02,770
It is precisely because you are so important to him that he subjects you to such harsh discipline.

619
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:05,480
Please do not resent him.

620
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:11,680
Assassinate?

621
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:13,110
Whom?

622
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:16,560
The second in line to the throne.

623
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,800
Count Julius, the White Dragon General.

624
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:26,350
The bolt that hit me was coated in poison.

625
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:31,380
A deadly poison the royal family has used for generations to assassinate those who oppose them.

626
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:34,510
This will be ugly.

627
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,350
Failure is out of the question.

628
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,060
Don't let yourself be identified.

629
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:50,980
That is precisely why I want you to do it.

630
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:53,530
Will you do it?

631
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:54,720
This ain't like you.

632
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,250
Just give me an order and stop grumbling.

633
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:01,370
Like always.

634
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:06,890
It grieves me to say this, but I fear you might have been a little—

635
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:08,170
Quiet, Hassan.

636
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:11,250
Adonis will not be a child forever.

637
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:15,010
He mustn't expect to get away with fulfilling his future duties as half-heartedly as he did today.

638
00:58:15,010 --> 00:58:15,930
But...

639
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:17,220
That will be all. Leave me.

640
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,480
I will not be defeated here!

641
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:45,660
How did he end up being hailed as the hero who protected the princess now?

642
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:53,120
Wind?

643
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:54,960
Hey, Hassan!

644
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:02,110
Burglars!

645
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:30,090
I... I know you...

646
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:35,120
You are... Griffith's...

647
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,260
Hey...

648
01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:22,550
No, I'm sure I heard something...

649
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:23,200
Someone's there!

650
01:01:24,930 --> 01:01:25,990
An intruder!

651
01:01:25,990 --> 01:01:27,410
Hey, is that...

652
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:28,740
Lord Adonis!

653
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:30,270
You bastard!

654
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:33,040
An intruder!

655
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:35,880
Fuck.

656
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:37,380
Fuck!

657
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:39,170
He has to be close!

658
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:40,670
Be prepared!

659
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:52,340
Why Adonis as well?

660
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:54,450
This is... so cruel...

661
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:01,340
Spread out!

662
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:04,070
Find him and don't led him escape from the castle!

663
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:16,420
There he is!

664
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:17,910
On the western ramparts!

665
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:18,920
Flank him!

666
01:02:55,270 --> 01:03:00,650
Right about now, Griffith must dining on much finer food at the princess' banquet.

667
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:07,420
Perhaps, but when attended by people who aren't used to such events, it's probably just stiff and ceremonious.

668
01:03:08,470 --> 01:03:09,840
What are you saying?

669
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:16,510
If you can eat as much good food as you want and bang some highborn ladies with oil in their hair, that's a small price to pay, right?

670
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,670
Bang, huh?

671
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:21,910
The whole thing is hosted by Charlotte.

672
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:23,240
You and your pipe dreams...

673
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,360
By the way, where's Guts?

674
01:03:25,610 --> 01:03:27,700
Haven't seen him since morning.

675
01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:31,990
He's probably off somewhere practicing by himself, that brainless butcher.

676
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:33,990
Please, Pippin.

677
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:38,930
Our columns were supposed to practice together today.

678
01:03:39,470 --> 01:03:41,480
He never even offered an excuse.

679
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:49,380
That...

680
01:03:54,190 --> 01:03:55,060
Guts!

681
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:58,980
Where were you wandering off all day?

682
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:04,660
Where's Griffith?

683
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:10,120
Griffith was invited to Charlotte's banquet...

684
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:13,860
He's probably at the Prom Rose mansion...

685
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:18,230
I see.

686
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:22,030
Hey! I'm not done talking to you!

687
01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:23,030
Guts!

688
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:28,260
An arrow wound?

689
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:04,130
What a nice wind...

690
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:09,130
I simply can't seem to fit in with them.

691
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:13,820
I'm a little tired.

692
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:26,270
Here, Lady Charlotte.

693
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:28,680
Oh, my!

694
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:32,450
Thank you.

695
01:05:42,890 --> 01:05:43,600
Wait.

696
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:46,220
Are you going to show up before him looking like that?

697
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,550
Don't make him lose face.

698
01:05:48,990 --> 01:05:52,030
If you have some business with him, wait until those two are done talking.

699
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,010
I need this for a minute.

700
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,190
Hey...

701
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:14,670
Why do men like to shed blood,

702
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:17,870
you asked.

703
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:24,700
You are right in saying that it is one of the facets we, men, possess.

704
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:30,120
However, it is but a tool to obtain what our heart desires and keep it from harm's way.

705
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:32,880
I believe it to be a double-edged blade.

706
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:35,720
What your heart desires...

707
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:38,020
a lover?

708
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:40,260
No, a knight's honor?

709
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:43,630
Both are important, aren't they?

710
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:48,460
Fighting and dying for love and honor is what a knight desires above all else.

711
01:06:51,950 --> 01:06:56,330
But for men there exists something even more important than that.

712
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:58,780
You know of it, I believe.

713
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:00,880
More important?

714
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:09,120
It is a dream formulated and fostered for your own sake.

715
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:14,130
A dream?

716
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:18,220
Men are entranced by their dreams regardless of birth, rank or social standing.

717
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:21,050
The dream supports them.

718
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:26,060
It makes them suffer and it breathes new life into them.

719
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:28,850
And it kills them.

720
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:32,440
Even after they've given up on it,

721
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:35,290
it continues to smolder in their hearts.

722
01:07:36,770 --> 01:07:40,910
All men have a dream at least once in their lives.

723
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:45,640
They imagine themselves being martyrs to the god their dream has become.

724
01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:50,520
Others live on powerlessly, birthed into the world.

725
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:54,170
I could not endure such a life.

726
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:04,500
Excuse me.

727
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:06,640
That must have been dreadfully boring for a lady such as yourself.

728
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:08,750
No, no.

729
01:08:09,510 --> 01:08:10,140
You are...

730
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:15,450
an unusual person, Griffith.

731
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:18,730
You are nobler than any aristocrat,

732
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:23,490
and yet you've taught me to whistle with leaves.

733
01:08:23,490 --> 01:08:26,040
You were akin to a child who grew up playing in the fields.

734
01:08:26,430 --> 01:08:29,340
Now you play the role of a philosopher.

735
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:46,910
Your friends must be following you because of your charisma as well.

736
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:53,010
They are my precious comrades with whom I have escaped death many times before.

737
01:08:54,180 --> 01:08:56,820
I would not call them friends, though.

738
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:01,270
Friends do not cling to another's dream.

739
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:04,160
They live for their own sake.

740
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:06,460
If there are those that oppose their dream,

741
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:08,580
then they resist them with all their heart and soul.

742
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:12,400
Even should it be me.

743
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:16,080
I believe that friends must

744
01:09:16,930 --> 01:09:19,630
stand on an even ground.

745
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:40,400
Sir Griffith,

746
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:42,850
what is your dream?

747
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:44,780
Princess!

748
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:53,160
What is it?

749
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:55,570
This is huge!

750
01:09:55,570 --> 01:09:58,670
Your uncle, Count Julius, has passed away!

751
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:00,280
What?

752
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,540
He was assassinated!

753
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:06,240
Somebody snuck into his castle and even killed his son Adonis!

754
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:09,060
The castle is in chaos!

755
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:10,650
The banquet has been aborted.

756
01:10:10,650 --> 01:10:12,400
You are to return to the castle at once.

757
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,060
Those are His Majesty's orders.

758
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:16,350
Soldiers will be here soon.

759
01:10:16,350 --> 01:10:18,620
Please make preparations at once.

760
01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:21,060
We're going back, Guts.

761
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,480
If the Tudors were behind this, then the war...

762
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:24,850
Guts?

763
01:11:07,490 --> 01:11:08,740
Preview

764
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:10,290
There's no time for doubt.

765
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:12,450
How will I strike?

766
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:14,240
How will I kill?

767
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:16,030
That's all.

768
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:22,960
I just wanted to be his blade...

769
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:26,300
What?

770
01:11:26,710 --> 01:11:29,050
That castle is just somewhat large.

771
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:33,180
If we just follow Griffith's orders as always, we can't lose.

772
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:46,740
Lay down your lives!

773
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:49,400
There is no other way to survive!

774
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:52,950
We win if we survive!

775
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:55,700
Golden Age Chapter II The Capture of Doldrey

776
01:11:56,260 --> 01:11:58,040
I thought I would bear witness myself.

777
01:11:58,470 --> 01:12:00,580
To see what Griffith and the Band of the Hawk have done,

778
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:03,200
and just what he has attained.

779
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:03,750
And also,

780
01:12:04,130 --> 01:12:06,090
what he is set on attaining in the future.

781
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,050
Opens To The Public June 2012

782
01:12:09,050 --> 01:12:09,090
}
