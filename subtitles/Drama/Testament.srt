1
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,562
<i>Right, left. Right, left.</i>

2
00:01:58,772 --> 00:02:03,300
<i>Right, left. Eight more. Right, left.</i>

3
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:08,140
<i>Seven, left. Six, left.</i>

4
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:12,876
<i>Right, left. Four, left.</i>

5
00:02:13,086 --> 00:02:17,182
<i>Three, left. Keep going. Two, left.</i>

6
00:02:17,424 --> 00:02:17,788
<i>And last time, left.</i>
<i>Now sit up just a little more.</i>

7
00:02:17,824 --> 00:02:22,318
<i>And last time, left.</i>
<i>Now sit up just a little more.</i>

8
00:02:22,562 --> 00:02:24,359
<i>Hands behind your head.</i>

9
00:02:24,564 --> 00:02:29,729
<i>Exhale and bring the right elbow</i>
<i>to the left knee. Inhale. Straighten.</i>

10
00:02:29,936 --> 00:02:32,803
<i>Exhale. Left elbow to right knee.</i>

11
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:37,705
<i>Inhale. Straighten. Right, up.</i>

12
00:02:37,911 --> 00:02:41,972
<i>Left, up. Right, up.</i>

13
00:02:42,515 --> 00:02:46,178
Never in the history of the world has
there been a boy as slow as you are.

14
00:02:46,386 --> 00:02:48,854
Now, come on, Brad,
move your dead ass. Let's go.

15
00:02:49,089 --> 00:02:51,114
I don't feel like it.

16
00:02:52,225 --> 00:02:53,522
Go ahead without me.

17
00:02:53,727 --> 00:02:57,128
I'm not going without you.
Come on, let's go. Get your bike.

18
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:02,232
Brad, you're gonna be a terrific rider.
You just gotta wake up.

19
00:03:02,435 --> 00:03:04,562
Get your bike, and let's go.

20
00:03:04,771 --> 00:03:06,238
I just don't feel like it. Not today.

21
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,464
You always say
you just don't feel like it.

22
00:03:08,675 --> 00:03:12,236
Then when you get out there,
you have a terrific time. Come on.

23
00:03:15,348 --> 00:03:17,646
- Not always.
- Brad.

24
00:03:18,017 --> 00:03:22,545
<i>Left, up. Right, up. Left, up.</i>

25
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:25,690
<i>Right, up. Left</i>...

26
00:03:48,248 --> 00:03:50,011
Hi, Bob.

27
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,548
- All right now, huh?
- Yeah.

28
00:03:58,792 --> 00:03:59,759
Yeah.

29
00:03:59,993 --> 00:04:02,154
- I just gotta wake up.
- You just gotta wake up.

30
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,598
- Think you'll be able to keep up?
- I might.

31
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,665
Sure, you will.

32
00:04:09,369 --> 00:04:10,563
You wait and see,

33
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,762
you'll turn around a couple years, I
won't even be able to keep up with you.

34
00:04:13,973 --> 00:04:16,203
You'll be blowing right by me.

35
00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:19,207
But I'll still be able to beat
your brother.

36
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,003
We're gonna be going
up that hill.

37
00:04:47,574 --> 00:04:49,235
- Right?
- Right.

38
00:04:49,442 --> 00:04:52,104
Charging up that hill.

39
00:04:52,812 --> 00:04:54,279
Let's do it!

40
00:04:54,647 --> 00:04:57,081
Come on, you're doing great.

41
00:04:58,218 --> 00:04:59,913
Come on.

42
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:01,814
You can do it!

43
00:05:02,322 --> 00:05:04,313
You can do it!

44
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:07,986
Come on.

45
00:05:09,896 --> 00:05:11,864
You can do it.

46
00:05:12,398 --> 00:05:14,161
Come on.

47
00:05:15,502 --> 00:05:17,436
Come on, pump!

48
00:05:19,606 --> 00:05:21,540
You can do it.

49
00:05:25,378 --> 00:05:27,107
Come on.

50
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,348
Morning, Henry.

51
00:05:44,497 --> 00:05:47,830
I'm gonna get started.
I'll see you back there.

52
00:05:51,638 --> 00:05:53,731
Hi, Mr. Abhart.

53
00:05:58,811 --> 00:06:00,676
Mary Liz.

54
00:06:02,248 --> 00:06:04,512
Mary Elizabeth.

55
00:06:05,852 --> 00:06:07,046
Speak to me.

56
00:06:07,253 --> 00:06:11,212
Mom, I'm not hungry,
and I don't have the time to eat.

57
00:06:11,891 --> 00:06:14,359
Breakfast, now.

58
00:06:17,864 --> 00:06:20,196
- What goes on here?
- I'm coming, Mom.

59
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,630
Yes, I can see that.

60
00:06:22,869 --> 00:06:26,862
- Here. Here. Here.
- I hate them.

61
00:06:27,106 --> 00:06:29,768
Those are your favorite pants. That's
your sweater that your grandmother

62
00:06:29,976 --> 00:06:32,137
sent you from Chicago.
What...?

63
00:06:32,345 --> 00:06:34,973
- What is all this?
- Some stuff.

64
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:37,274
Some dirty stuff.

65
00:06:37,483 --> 00:06:41,044
- Oh, Scottie.
- Don't open that!

66
00:06:41,354 --> 00:06:44,755
- Why not?
- There's treasure in there.

67
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,390
Excuse me.

68
00:06:46,593 --> 00:06:50,085
Listen, young man. I'm gonna count
to five. You better get dressed.

69
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,026
- No.
- One. Two.

70
00:06:53,232 --> 00:06:56,759
Three. Four. Five.

71
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,767
There's rehearsal today.

72
00:07:00,373 --> 00:07:02,432
- Hi, Tom.
- What do you say, Lar?

73
00:07:02,642 --> 00:07:05,042
Love the robe, Cynthia.

74
00:07:15,688 --> 00:07:18,054
- Good ride?
- Not so good.

75
00:07:18,257 --> 00:07:20,782
- Make the hill?
- Dad did.

76
00:07:21,027 --> 00:07:22,790
Mary Liz, come on.

77
00:07:34,807 --> 00:07:37,275
Scottie, stop fooling around.

78
00:07:37,844 --> 00:07:39,607
What time is it?

79
00:07:41,114 --> 00:07:44,481
Oh, that can't be right. I'm late.
Why didn't anybody call me?

80
00:07:44,684 --> 00:07:47,244
- Where's Daddy?
- You must eat something. Come on.

81
00:07:47,453 --> 00:07:48,818
Give me a break, Mother.

82
00:07:50,623 --> 00:07:52,454
Scottie!

83
00:08:13,446 --> 00:08:16,074
- Eighteen minutes flat, Mike.
- Is that good?

84
00:08:16,382 --> 00:08:18,247
That's fantastic.

85
00:08:18,718 --> 00:08:20,811
It's 30 seconds better
than my best time.

86
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,786
- What do you say, Hiroshi?
- Hiroshi, Tom can't go fishing now.

87
00:08:25,024 --> 00:08:27,549
- He has to go to work.
- Some other time, huh, pal?

88
00:08:27,794 --> 00:08:29,159
- Okay.
- How about Sunday?

89
00:08:29,362 --> 00:08:31,830
- Yeah.
- Catch a fish as big as your old man.

90
00:08:32,065 --> 00:08:33,396
- This big?
- Bigger.

91
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:34,600
- Bigger.
- Bigger.

92
00:08:34,801 --> 00:08:36,462
- This big!
- That's a minnow.

93
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,193
Tom.

94
00:08:38,404 --> 00:08:40,065
It's all right, Mike. I don't mind.

95
00:08:40,273 --> 00:08:42,138
Hell, he gets along great
with my kids.

96
00:08:42,341 --> 00:08:44,172
- I'll see you Sunday, huh, Hiroshi?
- Yeah.

97
00:08:44,377 --> 00:08:47,778
All right. See you later.
Take care, Mike.

98
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,746
- See you tomorrow.
- See you this morning.

99
00:08:57,757 --> 00:08:59,588
Come on, kids, you're gonna be late.

100
00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:01,555
Okay.

101
00:09:01,928 --> 00:09:04,658
- Bye.
- Bye-bye. Have a good day.

102
00:09:05,665 --> 00:09:08,566
- Bye, Daddy.
- Hey, don't I get a kiss?

103
00:09:08,768 --> 00:09:10,497
Yes.

104
00:09:13,072 --> 00:09:14,835
- I made it in 18 minutes.
- Really?

105
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,099
- Yeah.
- Bye.

106
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:18,641
Hey, we'll do it again in the morning.
You'll do better.

107
00:09:18,845 --> 00:09:19,834
Yeah.

108
00:09:20,546 --> 00:09:22,104
Come on, let's get going.

109
00:09:22,348 --> 00:09:24,578
I made it in 18 minutes.

110
00:09:24,784 --> 00:09:27,981
- You smell.
- I smell? That stinks.

111
00:09:28,221 --> 00:09:30,189
- Thanks for telling me.
- Eighteen minutes.

112
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:33,586
Well, that's great. How about...?
Where did you go?

113
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,223
Shower, shave and clean up.
Remember, I smell.

114
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,523
- How about a little help?
- No.

115
00:09:39,732 --> 00:09:41,927
No time. I'll do it tonight, leave it.

116
00:09:42,135 --> 00:09:44,228
They come this morning.

117
00:09:45,171 --> 00:09:47,765
Come on, sweetie pie, let's go.

118
00:09:49,542 --> 00:09:51,476
Where's the toilet paper?
I couldn't find any.

119
00:09:51,711 --> 00:09:53,770
- Have you seen my keys?
- I can't see anything.

120
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,312
- Have you seen my wallet?
- Where's Scottie? Scott!

121
00:09:56,549 --> 00:09:58,710
- Where's my breakfast?
- Try your other pants.

122
00:09:58,918 --> 00:10:00,579
Right over here, on the table.

123
00:10:00,787 --> 00:10:04,018
- Boo! I'm a rat from Europe.
- A what from where?

124
00:10:04,257 --> 00:10:07,658
- You are not a rat, Scottie.
- I wanna be a rat.

125
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,885
- Looks like a rat to me.
- No, he's a child.

126
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:11,960
I don't know about that,
except for this banana.

127
00:10:12,165 --> 00:10:15,623
Well, in the school play.
A child, a very important part.

128
00:10:15,835 --> 00:10:18,235
- I'd rather be the rat.
- Does that mean I can be a rat?

129
00:10:18,437 --> 00:10:20,337
- Thanks a lot, pal.
- It's only a school play.

130
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,201
Yes, one I happen to be
the director of.

131
00:10:22,408 --> 00:10:24,501
- An act of suicide, if I ever saw.
- What's suicide?

132
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,734
Tom.

133
00:10:26,112 --> 00:10:28,137
- I didn't say anything.
- You certainly did.

134
00:10:28,347 --> 00:10:32,283
- Stop, you're making my ears hurt.
- I gotta go.

135
00:10:32,618 --> 00:10:34,882
- What about breakfast?
- Don't waste it.

136
00:10:35,121 --> 00:10:37,180
Give us a kiss, rat.

137
00:10:38,191 --> 00:10:39,624
Mommy.

138
00:10:39,992 --> 00:10:44,929
My God, look at the size
of that dandruff, huh? Here's a kiss.

139
00:10:45,565 --> 00:10:47,123
Bye, rat.

140
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,159
Bye, madam director.

141
00:10:57,877 --> 00:10:59,970
Ah, my wallet.

142
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,037
Tom?

143
00:11:28,307 --> 00:11:30,639
Did you hear that? Was that Scottie?

144
00:11:32,245 --> 00:11:34,236
Go to sleep.

145
00:11:39,285 --> 00:11:41,219
We have to talk.

146
00:11:41,587 --> 00:11:43,578
Some other time.

147
00:11:43,956 --> 00:11:45,651
There is no other time.

148
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:48,123
Go to sleep.

149
00:11:49,762 --> 00:11:51,627
I'm serious.

150
00:11:52,498 --> 00:11:54,898
So am I. Turn off the light.

151
00:11:55,101 --> 00:11:57,661
This is the only time we have time.

152
00:12:02,475 --> 00:12:05,410
What are we gonna get Brad
for his birthday?

153
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:08,444
He wants that computer game.

154
00:12:08,648 --> 00:12:11,617
Get him a good bike. Lygee.

155
00:12:11,851 --> 00:12:13,716
A solid Peugeot.

156
00:12:13,953 --> 00:12:17,218
Get him out of toys and into the real
world. That's what he needs.

157
00:12:17,456 --> 00:12:19,686
That's what you think he needs.

158
00:12:20,092 --> 00:12:22,583
Why are we talking about this?

159
00:12:25,564 --> 00:12:28,795
Brad's birthday is two months away.
Why are we talking?

160
00:12:29,001 --> 00:12:33,199
Go to sleep. Turn out the light.

161
00:12:36,676 --> 00:12:40,840
Ronnie Peebler didn't register
for the draft. He's been indicted.

162
00:12:43,015 --> 00:12:45,245
I don't know what's gonna happen.

163
00:12:45,451 --> 00:12:47,919
- Brad will be 18 in...
- Carol.

164
00:12:48,154 --> 00:12:49,587
What?

165
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:54,326
In five years and two months.

166
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,859
- Then wake me. Now?
- Go to sleep?

167
00:12:58,064 --> 00:12:59,691
Yes.

168
00:13:14,513 --> 00:13:18,381
- Now what are you doing?
- Looking for my journal.

169
00:13:18,918 --> 00:13:23,378
- Carol, it's the middle of the night.
- So what?

170
00:13:31,831 --> 00:13:36,131
- There isn't anything in that journal.
- Well, I'm gonna start right now.

171
00:13:50,383 --> 00:13:52,817
I've heard that before.

172
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:56,210
Sometimes you're such a...

173
00:13:58,657 --> 00:14:00,887
I've heard that before.

174
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:07,526
Okay.

175
00:14:09,301 --> 00:14:11,269
Talk to me.

176
00:14:12,471 --> 00:14:16,532
I've heard that before.
I've tried that before.

177
00:14:23,249 --> 00:14:25,479
What are you doing?
Get out of there.

178
00:14:26,085 --> 00:14:27,985
- Get out of there.
- Get out of where?

179
00:14:28,187 --> 00:14:29,484
Cut it out.

180
00:14:29,722 --> 00:14:32,122
Give you something to write
in your journal.

181
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:35,685
Okay, you asked for it.

182
00:14:38,831 --> 00:14:40,696
This is from...

183
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,866
And this is from...

184
00:14:47,173 --> 00:14:49,368
Who did you say that was from?

185
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:01,680
It's time, honey.

186
00:15:02,555 --> 00:15:06,150
- I don't wanna do that.
- Fellas, what's happening?

187
00:15:06,392 --> 00:15:08,690
You can have the straw too.

188
00:15:08,894 --> 00:15:11,124
Come on, gang, let's move it.

189
00:15:13,365 --> 00:15:14,627
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, darling.

190
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:16,699
Bye, Mom.

191
00:15:17,436 --> 00:15:19,165
Bye, Mom.

192
00:15:25,244 --> 00:15:27,007
Let me out of here.

193
00:15:39,158 --> 00:15:40,989
And they'll pop out from behind.

194
00:15:41,227 --> 00:15:45,493
- Like, they'll all pop out.
- Now, let's get down to work.

195
00:15:45,931 --> 00:15:48,229
Rats, over there.

196
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:51,302
Children, over here.

197
00:15:51,804 --> 00:15:55,262
- The mayor. Where's the mayor?
- Right here.

198
00:15:55,474 --> 00:15:57,442
Here's the mayor.

199
00:15:58,777 --> 00:16:00,836
And the Pied Piper also.

200
00:16:01,046 --> 00:16:06,746
Lisa, come beside me.
And the little crippled boy.

201
00:16:06,952 --> 00:16:09,477
Come on, Scottie, yes.

202
00:16:09,722 --> 00:16:13,214
- Now, you'll do fine.
- Here, darling, I'll take it.

203
00:16:14,727 --> 00:16:15,887
Now...

204
00:16:16,896 --> 00:16:18,727
...piano, please.

205
00:16:28,107 --> 00:16:33,443
Thank you. Now, I want you all
to listen to Mrs. Wetherly.

206
00:16:33,913 --> 00:16:35,904
All right. Let's begin.

207
00:16:36,115 --> 00:16:39,607
All the rats go over here.
Crouch down low.

208
00:16:40,286 --> 00:16:42,117
Crouch down low for the beginning.

209
00:16:42,354 --> 00:16:45,653
Townspeople, just push back.
Give Lisa some space.

210
00:16:45,925 --> 00:16:48,519
That's right. Remember how
we did it before? Good.

211
00:16:49,094 --> 00:16:52,860
Okay, Lisa? Lisa, come on, darling.

212
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,895
- Do you know your opening lines?
- Yeah.

213
00:16:56,101 --> 00:16:57,625
Now, remember that there's
gonna be people

214
00:16:57,836 --> 00:17:00,361
way in the back of that room,
and they need to hear you too.

215
00:17:00,573 --> 00:17:03,474
So you wanna speak up
a little more. All right?

216
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:10,271
Welcome. We wanted to do this play
because we live in Hamlin, California.

217
00:17:10,482 --> 00:17:15,510
So did this story happen a long
time ago, in a town called Hamelin.

218
00:17:15,754 --> 00:17:16,846
Thank you.

219
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:18,852
Wonderful. Okay, Lisa goes off.

220
00:17:19,091 --> 00:17:22,356
Now, all of you run to your town places.
The rats go into the mountain.

221
00:17:26,332 --> 00:17:31,269
<i>While fishing for dinner,</i>
<i>a boy caught a big letter A.</i>

222
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,165
<i>He then caught a B,</i>

223
00:17:33,372 --> 00:17:37,035
<i>a C, D, an E</i>
<i>and an F, G, H, I, J...</i>

224
00:17:37,243 --> 00:17:39,234
<i>Hi, dear, won't be home until late.</i>
<i>Don't wait dinner.</i>

225
00:17:39,445 --> 00:17:41,936
<i>In fact, forget dinner. Sorry.</i>

226
00:17:45,684 --> 00:17:47,982
- How's it now?
- Funny.

227
00:17:48,887 --> 00:17:51,879
That's a big help.
What's that supposed to mean?

228
00:17:52,124 --> 00:17:55,252
- Mary Liz, will you turn that down?
- Wrinkles.

229
00:17:55,761 --> 00:17:57,558
What? I can't hear you.

230
00:17:57,763 --> 00:18:00,596
Mary Lizard, would you shut
that thing off.

231
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,266
No.

232
00:18:02,468 --> 00:18:05,130
<i>Hi, dear. How's everybody?</i>

233
00:18:05,337 --> 00:18:09,239
<i>Dad and I thought we might drop in</i>
<i>on you guys around Easter.</i>

234
00:18:09,441 --> 00:18:11,500
- <i>It's snowing in Chicago.</i>
- Yes.

235
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,837
- <i>Call us collect.</i>
- Yes, what?

236
00:18:14,046 --> 00:18:16,640
No more wrinkles.

237
00:18:18,017 --> 00:18:20,008
Stupid antenna.

238
00:18:20,219 --> 00:18:23,211
When are we gonna get cable
like everybody else?

239
00:18:24,556 --> 00:18:26,251
<i>It's me again, honey.</i>
<i>Scratch that last stuff.</i>

240
00:18:26,492 --> 00:18:29,723
<i>Gonna get out of here by 3:30,</i>
<i>and with luck, I'll be home by 5.</i>

241
00:18:29,928 --> 00:18:32,089
Your dad will be home for dinner.

242
00:18:33,432 --> 00:18:37,664
<i>Carol, Cynthia. This costume</i>
<i>for the play is driving me crazy.</i>

243
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:38,962
<i>Call me.</i>

244
00:18:39,171 --> 00:18:40,638
<i>What's a alphabet?</i>

245
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:42,602
<i>You don't know</i>
<i>what the alphabet is?</i>

246
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:45,036
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>A, B, C, D, E, F, G.</i>

247
00:18:45,244 --> 00:18:48,077
- <i>Do you know what it's for?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

248
00:18:50,149 --> 00:18:51,707
Better try again.

249
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:54,283
That's not the antenna, Mom.

250
00:18:56,388 --> 00:18:58,686
Hands off, banana man.

251
00:19:08,434 --> 00:19:12,530
<i>This is San Francisco.</i>
<i>We have lost our New York signal.</i>

252
00:19:12,738 --> 00:19:16,902
<i>Radar sources confirm the explosion</i>
<i>of nuclear devices</i>

253
00:19:17,343 --> 00:19:20,642
<i>there, in New York,</i>
<i>and up and down the East Coast.</i>

254
00:19:22,214 --> 00:19:26,378
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, this is real.</i>
<i>This is</i>...

255
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,811
<i>We interrupt this program</i>
<i>at the request of the White House.</i>

256
00:19:31,156 --> 00:19:32,817
<i>This is a national emergency.</i>

257
00:19:33,092 --> 00:19:35,560
<i>This is an emergency action</i>
<i>notification.</i>

258
00:19:35,794 --> 00:19:39,230
<i>I repeat, we interrupt this program</i>
<i>at the request of the White House.</i>

259
00:19:39,465 --> 00:19:41,057
<i>Do not use your telephone.</i>

260
00:19:41,266 --> 00:19:44,167
<i>Telephone lines should be</i>
<i>kept open for official use.</i>

261
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,531
<i>Important instructions will follow.</i>

262
00:19:46,772 --> 00:19:48,831
- <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
- Hello?

263
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,066
- <i>the president of the United States.</i>
- Tom?

264
00:19:51,543 --> 00:19:54,376
- Hello?
- Mom!

265
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,979
- Mom!
- Get away from that window!

266
00:19:56,181 --> 00:19:59,776
- Mommy?
- Get down on the floor. Get down.

267
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:02,344
- Was that Dad?
- Is he in San Francisco?

268
00:20:02,588 --> 00:20:03,919
- I'm scared.
- I don't know.

269
00:20:04,156 --> 00:20:05,783
Put your heads down,
cover your eyes.

270
00:20:06,024 --> 00:20:08,549
Oh, my God. My God.

271
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:19,898
Mommy! Mama!

272
00:20:20,105 --> 00:20:22,437
- Kenny!
- Mommy.

273
00:20:24,443 --> 00:20:26,035
Kenny!

274
00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:32,242
- Carol.
- There's Phil and Cathy.

275
00:20:32,451 --> 00:20:34,214
- They're safe.
- What happened?

276
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,581
I don't know. No one does yet.

277
00:20:36,822 --> 00:20:40,417
- We just got home.
- We just got back. We're so lucky.

278
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:42,559
Thank God we're all here.

279
00:20:44,229 --> 00:20:45,753
Kenny!

280
00:20:45,998 --> 00:20:48,159
- Have you seen Kenny?
- No.

281
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:49,898
Where's Tom?

282
00:20:50,102 --> 00:20:52,229
He'll be here any minute.

283
00:20:53,472 --> 00:20:55,372
I'm sure he will be.

284
00:20:55,574 --> 00:20:57,804
Mommy!

285
00:20:58,911 --> 00:21:00,242
<i>Tom,</i>

286
00:21:00,379 --> 00:21:02,438
<i>we're at Henry Abhart's.</i>

287
00:21:02,648 --> 00:21:04,138
<i>We're all okay.</i>

288
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:07,283
<i>Come. We'll wait.</i>

289
00:21:09,054 --> 00:21:12,990
CQ, CQ, CQ.
This is W6DN,

290
00:21:13,192 --> 00:21:16,093
Whiskey Six Delta November
calling.

291
00:21:17,729 --> 00:21:19,196
Three generators.

292
00:21:19,431 --> 00:21:21,490
He built it specially.

293
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,793
It's still working.

294
00:21:24,136 --> 00:21:27,765
No, there's no damage here,
except all transistors are knocked out.

295
00:21:27,973 --> 00:21:31,841
- Who else have you talked to, Hal?
- Rosemary, dear. You both all right?

296
00:21:32,044 --> 00:21:34,205
Yeah, I been trying to raise them
myself, without success.

297
00:21:34,413 --> 00:21:37,109
He's raised Yuba City and Eureka,

298
00:21:37,316 --> 00:21:39,910
and we got a place somewhere
near Omaha, Nebraska.

299
00:21:40,118 --> 00:21:43,952
Maybe there's an electromagnetic
radiation effect there.

300
00:21:44,723 --> 00:21:46,623
You keep trying, Hal.

301
00:21:50,162 --> 00:21:52,096
Well, folks...

302
00:21:52,598 --> 00:21:59,231
...so far I can't raise Seattle, Portland,
Sacramento or Southern California.

303
00:21:59,771 --> 00:22:01,568
San Francisco is silent.

304
00:22:01,773 --> 00:22:04,503
The entire Bay Area.

305
00:22:05,043 --> 00:22:08,501
Visalia and a chunk of Montana.
West Texas.

306
00:22:08,714 --> 00:22:10,807
North of us, now, they're okay.

307
00:22:11,316 --> 00:22:12,806
What about Chicago?

308
00:22:15,521 --> 00:22:19,719
So far, I can't raise anything
east of Keokuk, lowa.

309
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:23,227
A fellow in Twain Harte
thinks they hit Yosemite.

310
00:22:23,462 --> 00:22:25,293
The sky is black with splinters,

311
00:22:25,497 --> 00:22:28,261
and trees and rocks
coming down like rain.

312
00:22:28,467 --> 00:22:32,335
Must have been a mistake.
There's nothing strategic there.

313
00:22:33,338 --> 00:22:35,568
We keep waiting for word
from Washington,

314
00:22:35,807 --> 00:22:37,866
or where they've evacuated to.

315
00:22:38,443 --> 00:22:40,138
And it'll come.

316
00:22:40,812 --> 00:22:45,010
We may be crippled, but we're not
cut off and we're not dead.

317
00:22:46,051 --> 00:22:47,541
If you want news,

318
00:22:47,786 --> 00:22:52,450
if you want food and water,
and whatever we got, we can spare.

319
00:22:52,691 --> 00:22:56,058
Rosemary and I, we'll be here.

320
00:22:56,795 --> 00:23:00,026
Day or night, we'll be here.

321
00:23:15,247 --> 00:23:16,771
Tom?

322
00:23:20,552 --> 00:23:22,144
Mama...

323
00:23:22,521 --> 00:23:23,886
...where's Daddy?

324
00:23:25,991 --> 00:23:27,891
He'll be here, honey,
as soon as he can.

325
00:23:28,994 --> 00:23:31,792
- But I want Daddy.
- Mary Liz, it's all right.

326
00:23:32,464 --> 00:23:34,329
Come on in.

327
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,473
Brad?

328
00:23:43,675 --> 00:23:45,643
I'm okay, Mom.

329
00:23:47,012 --> 00:23:48,877
What are you doing?

330
00:23:49,815 --> 00:23:51,646
Keeping watch?

331
00:23:53,085 --> 00:23:54,882
Dad would.

332
00:24:25,717 --> 00:24:28,345
<i>February 24th.</i>

333
00:24:29,021 --> 00:24:31,114
<i>I'm so afraid.</i>

334
00:24:31,757 --> 00:24:33,918
<i>Nothing seems real.</i>

335
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,753
<i>Everything looks the same.</i>

336
00:24:37,129 --> 00:24:39,757
<i>Maybe if I write it will help.</i>

337
00:24:49,141 --> 00:24:51,974
<i>I ache to talk to my mother.</i>

338
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,778
<i>If I could only hear her voice.</i>

339
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,414
I hate breakfast.

340
00:24:57,616 --> 00:25:00,779
- Since when?
- I can't know.

341
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,586
My dish has dirt on it.

342
00:25:05,123 --> 00:25:08,559
- So does mine.
- Let me see.

343
00:25:09,161 --> 00:25:10,958
Well, we'll wipe them off.

344
00:25:11,163 --> 00:25:14,132
- There are others.
- Thanks.

345
00:25:18,637 --> 00:25:20,002
Thank you, darling.

346
00:25:21,106 --> 00:25:23,336
The milk tastes funny.

347
00:25:24,676 --> 00:25:27,770
- It's warm.
- When's our refrigerator gonna work?

348
00:25:27,979 --> 00:25:30,106
Doesn't radiation get into cows?

349
00:25:31,616 --> 00:25:32,981
We'll use powdered milk.

350
00:25:33,185 --> 00:25:35,745
Your dad has all that stuff
from your camping trips.

351
00:25:35,954 --> 00:25:38,184
That stuff tastes funny too.

352
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:40,619
Doesn't radiation get into water?

353
00:25:41,093 --> 00:25:44,529
Well, it can.
Maybe it won't be so bad here.

354
00:25:44,763 --> 00:25:46,697
But we'd better be careful.

355
00:25:46,898 --> 00:25:48,866
What's "radation"?

356
00:25:51,837 --> 00:25:55,898
- Here, have a banana.
- You never gave me one before.

357
00:25:56,508 --> 00:25:57,566
I did now.

358
00:25:57,776 --> 00:26:00,904
There may not be any more
for a while.

359
00:26:02,547 --> 00:26:04,708
- May I have the butter, Mary Liz?
- Yeah.

360
00:26:04,916 --> 00:26:06,178
Would you see who that is, dear?

361
00:26:06,752 --> 00:26:09,118
When's the television gonna work?

362
00:26:09,321 --> 00:26:11,016
What are we gonna do today?

363
00:26:11,256 --> 00:26:13,816
- No more questions, okay?
- Hi, Larry.

364
00:26:14,726 --> 00:26:16,990
- Here, darling.
- Okay.

365
00:26:18,997 --> 00:26:20,225
Hello, Larry.

366
00:26:20,432 --> 00:26:24,926
Can I stay here until my mother and
father get back from San Francisco?

367
00:26:25,537 --> 00:26:27,767
Were you alone all night?

368
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,204
Are they with Dad, Mommy?

369
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,975
Maybe.

370
00:26:35,514 --> 00:26:37,243
Of course you can.

371
00:26:39,251 --> 00:26:41,014
- Like some bread?
- Yes.

372
00:26:41,219 --> 00:26:43,449
- Mary Liz?
- Yes, please.

373
00:26:48,026 --> 00:26:50,392
- Brad?
- Okay.

374
00:26:51,463 --> 00:26:53,727
If you... If you could just quiet down.

375
00:26:53,932 --> 00:26:57,060
Just, could...? Could you, please,
just be quiet?

376
00:26:57,269 --> 00:26:58,668
Just one moment,

377
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:01,304
and then we will tell you
exactly what we know.

378
00:27:01,506 --> 00:27:03,497
- All right, now, listen!
- Which isn't very much.

379
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:05,869
- Please listen!
- Quiet!

380
00:27:06,077 --> 00:27:08,409
All of you, listen.

381
00:27:08,613 --> 00:27:10,513
When are you gonna do something?

382
00:27:10,715 --> 00:27:14,412
We just don't have all the answers.
That's all there is to it.

383
00:27:14,619 --> 00:27:17,816
- But we are trying to find out.
- Tell us anything you know.

384
00:27:18,056 --> 00:27:21,822
Henry Abhart is talking with other
communities, some even in Canada.

385
00:27:22,027 --> 00:27:25,724
- There may be answers outside.
- You can't depend on that old man.

386
00:27:25,931 --> 00:27:28,195
Who else knows how
to run that radio?

387
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,992
I mean, he's gonna have
to have some relief.

388
00:27:30,202 --> 00:27:32,329
We're hoping to get
our communications network

389
00:27:32,537 --> 00:27:35,005
restored shortly.
That should give us a fair picture

390
00:27:35,207 --> 00:27:37,266
- of what's happening out there.
- I'm not worried about

391
00:27:37,475 --> 00:27:40,467
what's happening out there.
I'm worried about right here, Darryl.

392
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:44,308
I got a plate-glass window
broken, $500.

393
00:27:44,516 --> 00:27:48,282
My pharmacy's looted, 2,000,
3,000 dollars.

394
00:27:48,486 --> 00:27:50,852
- I want my goods back now.
- We all know that the supermarket

395
00:27:51,089 --> 00:27:55,048
- was broken into last night, Darryl.
- There has been some looting,

396
00:27:55,293 --> 00:27:58,922
but right now the markets are
under guard and it's quiet out there.

397
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,826
Look, if there's any further trouble,
we'll invoke martial law.

398
00:28:02,033 --> 00:28:03,967
- At least for a while.
- Someone comes by my place,

399
00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:07,730
they try to do something, I am gonna
protect myself. I don't care who it is!

400
00:28:07,939 --> 00:28:09,304
You don't take the law
in your own hands.

401
00:28:09,507 --> 00:28:11,668
Hey, calm down.
Don't create panic here.

402
00:28:11,877 --> 00:28:13,970
This isn't getting us anywhere.

403
00:28:14,179 --> 00:28:16,739
The reason why we've come here
today is to work together,

404
00:28:16,948 --> 00:28:19,246
to make this community work.

405
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:22,480
We...

406
00:28:23,355 --> 00:28:26,722
We called off school today.

407
00:28:26,925 --> 00:28:31,385
The teachers and the administration,
we thought,

408
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:35,657
"What's the point?"
Now, that was wrong.

409
00:28:36,668 --> 00:28:40,570
I remember after the president
was assassinated,

410
00:28:40,772 --> 00:28:43,832
we bowed our heads, we mourned...

411
00:28:45,343 --> 00:28:47,573
...we went on.

412
00:28:57,689 --> 00:29:01,250
Look, maybe... Maybe we should start
a community force.

413
00:29:01,493 --> 00:29:04,189
- What, like the Red Cross?
- Yes, like the Red Cross.

414
00:29:04,396 --> 00:29:07,229
To help those people who need it.

415
00:29:07,432 --> 00:29:10,492
I don't think it's reasonable to expect
we're gonna get help from the outside.

416
00:29:10,702 --> 00:29:12,863
- We have civil defense.
- What civil defense?

417
00:29:13,071 --> 00:29:16,097
Are you people crazy? You're talking
like this is an earthquake

418
00:29:16,308 --> 00:29:19,607
or a hurricane. Well, it's not!
Bernie, you're a doctor,

419
00:29:19,811 --> 00:29:21,836
why don't you tell these good people
what they've got

420
00:29:22,047 --> 00:29:23,241
to look forward to here.

421
00:29:28,219 --> 00:29:30,210
We don't know yet.

422
00:29:31,323 --> 00:29:35,419
Well, we really have no equipment
available for accurately measuring

423
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,888
radiation fallout.

424
00:29:38,229 --> 00:29:42,188
If the rads dosage reaches...

425
00:29:42,867 --> 00:29:47,099
...40 or 50 per hour,
and remains there long,

426
00:29:47,305 --> 00:29:49,170
there will be illness.

427
00:29:49,374 --> 00:29:54,141
And that can lead to dizziness...

428
00:29:55,146 --> 00:29:58,115
...gastroenteritis, fever,

429
00:29:58,984 --> 00:30:01,043
vomiting,

430
00:30:01,252 --> 00:30:05,746
skin sores, hair loss.

431
00:30:15,133 --> 00:30:16,760
Doctor?

432
00:30:17,969 --> 00:30:19,766
- Doctor?
- Bernie.

433
00:30:21,806 --> 00:30:24,138
My baby wouldn't take my milk
this morning.

434
00:30:24,342 --> 00:30:26,469
She threw it up.

435
00:30:28,113 --> 00:30:32,243
Maybe that's nothing,
maybe she'll be fine in the morning,

436
00:30:32,851 --> 00:30:34,842
but how do I know?

437
00:30:35,754 --> 00:30:39,417
Is there...?
Is there something I can do?

438
00:30:45,196 --> 00:30:49,929
The best sources we have
recommend using only bottled water

439
00:30:50,135 --> 00:30:52,899
and eating canned food.

440
00:30:53,338 --> 00:30:55,067
Oh, you make me laugh.

441
00:30:55,507 --> 00:31:00,171
Bombs, hundreds of bombs,
are leveling cities.

442
00:31:00,311 --> 00:31:04,270
It's throwing debris
miles into the sky.

443
00:31:04,482 --> 00:31:06,177
And you're telling me
it's gonna have trouble

444
00:31:06,384 --> 00:31:09,319
finding its way
into my canned apricots.

445
00:31:14,659 --> 00:31:17,253
Hey! You don't understand.

446
00:31:17,495 --> 00:31:20,225
Hey, you! You!
I want you out of that line.

447
00:31:20,432 --> 00:31:25,199
There are other people waiting for gas.
You got some nerve cutting in front.

448
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:34,572
No. No, no, no.

449
00:31:34,779 --> 00:31:36,713
No! Come on! Out! Out!

450
00:31:36,915 --> 00:31:39,383
Come on! Come on, move!

451
00:31:39,584 --> 00:31:42,075
Oh, no, no, no. No credit card.
No. No, no.

452
00:31:42,287 --> 00:31:44,812
I don't have time for you, come on.

453
00:31:52,097 --> 00:31:53,689
Good morning, missus.

454
00:31:53,898 --> 00:31:56,059
Your husband get home last night?

455
00:31:56,267 --> 00:31:58,201
He was on his way.

456
00:31:58,403 --> 00:32:01,566
We thought we'd come by,
in case we hear from him.

457
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:06,674
- What are you charging?
- It's free to my regular customers.

458
00:32:07,345 --> 00:32:09,006
Hiroshi!

459
00:32:10,115 --> 00:32:14,552
I thought last night, Hiroshi and I,
we don't need much.

460
00:32:14,752 --> 00:32:17,152
Food and roof.

461
00:32:17,388 --> 00:32:19,117
Store some canned goods.

462
00:32:19,357 --> 00:32:22,656
When the gas is gone,
we'll plant a garden.

463
00:32:22,861 --> 00:32:24,795
Go fishing.
Hey, Hiroshi.

464
00:32:24,996 --> 00:32:28,261
- You wanna go fishing?
- Go fishing? Yeah.

465
00:32:28,466 --> 00:32:29,899
Can I go fishing too?

466
00:32:31,402 --> 00:32:33,666
How come the gun, Mike?

467
00:32:33,872 --> 00:32:37,171
Just because I'm giving away gas,
I'm no fool.

468
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:38,535
You too.

469
00:32:38,743 --> 00:32:40,643
Ones that never been here,

470
00:32:40,845 --> 00:32:43,905
ones that never had time for us,
for Hiroshi.

471
00:32:44,115 --> 00:32:45,810
Hiroshi.

472
00:32:46,417 --> 00:32:48,647
Well, I'll accept the gas, Mike,

473
00:32:48,853 --> 00:32:50,684
but only if you and Hiroshi
come over for a meal.

474
00:32:50,922 --> 00:32:52,287
I wanna repay you somehow.

475
00:32:54,893 --> 00:32:58,329
The gas has been paid for, missus,
many times.

476
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:01,124
I just hope you get to have
a use for it.

477
00:33:02,734 --> 00:33:04,258
Hiroshi.

478
00:33:27,025 --> 00:33:29,289
<i>February 25th.</i>

479
00:33:29,761 --> 00:33:31,251
<i>I stopped sleeping.</i>

480
00:33:31,496 --> 00:33:34,090
<i>Afraid to close my eyes.</i>

481
00:33:35,266 --> 00:33:38,235
<i>I find myself staring at the children.</i>

482
00:33:39,737 --> 00:33:42,035
<i>How did this happen?</i>

483
00:34:13,338 --> 00:34:14,703
- Hi, darling.
- Hi.

484
00:34:14,906 --> 00:34:16,533
There's no saving places in line.

485
00:34:17,408 --> 00:34:18,670
He's my son.

486
00:34:18,876 --> 00:34:20,503
I don't care,
I've been waiting for hours.

487
00:34:20,712 --> 00:34:23,442
Well, so has he.
More than four hours.

488
00:34:23,648 --> 00:34:25,115
This is our place.

489
00:34:25,316 --> 00:34:27,216
You got a lot of nerve.

490
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:41,624
- Hi, Brad.
- Hi.

491
00:35:01,319 --> 00:35:06,757
<i>H- E-A-V-E-N.</i>

492
00:35:06,958 --> 00:35:08,823
<i>You win.</i>

493
00:35:09,027 --> 00:35:10,517
I saw that, Billdocker.

494
00:35:10,762 --> 00:35:12,024
So what, Wetherly?

495
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,697
- Put them back.
- So what?

496
00:35:13,898 --> 00:35:16,332
A couple of batteries.

497
00:36:02,714 --> 00:36:04,739
- Hello, Brad.
- Hi, Mrs. Abhart.

498
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:07,850
- How's your family?
- Okay.

499
00:36:10,688 --> 00:36:13,680
Well, I heard that too.
You know what happened?

500
00:36:13,925 --> 00:36:17,258
Nova Scotia heard the Russians
pulled a preemptive strike.

501
00:36:17,462 --> 00:36:19,657
West Texas heard it was
the Chinese,

502
00:36:19,864 --> 00:36:24,858
South America heard it was
some radical liberation organization.

503
00:36:25,737 --> 00:36:28,228
Glad to hear from you,
November Six Hotel Lima.

504
00:36:28,439 --> 00:36:30,464
Catch you soon again, Harvey.

505
00:36:32,877 --> 00:36:34,344
Hi, laddie.

506
00:36:34,545 --> 00:36:36,843
That was Santa Rosa,
they got it worse than we do.

507
00:36:37,048 --> 00:36:39,141
Some actual blast damage.

508
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:42,376
Lot of concern about contamination.
Good spirit, though.

509
00:36:42,587 --> 00:36:43,781
Can I stay, Mr. Abhart?

510
00:36:43,988 --> 00:36:46,320
I'll tell you what. You can...

511
00:36:46,557 --> 00:36:50,994
...run these down to Dr. Jenson
and that lady mayor.

512
00:36:51,229 --> 00:36:52,719
They want these rad numbers.

513
00:36:52,964 --> 00:36:55,660
Why, what they're gonna do with them,
I don't know.

514
00:36:55,867 --> 00:36:57,596
- Have you got your bike?
- Yeah.

515
00:36:57,969 --> 00:36:59,800
You rode up the hill?

516
00:37:00,938 --> 00:37:02,963
I knew you would.

517
00:37:07,145 --> 00:37:11,343
I keep hoping to reach Mischa Usoff
in the U.S.S.R.

518
00:37:11,549 --> 00:37:13,346
Can I come back, Mr. Abhart?

519
00:37:14,485 --> 00:37:17,477
I'll tell you what. You do that.

520
00:37:27,198 --> 00:37:29,496
<i>Eleven days.</i>

521
00:37:31,068 --> 00:37:33,468
<i>I wear your sweater.</i>

522
00:37:34,305 --> 00:37:37,103
<i>It smells like you, my love.</i>

523
00:37:50,655 --> 00:37:52,885
I thought we'd go on a picnic today.

524
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:54,853
Up by the trees.

525
00:37:55,092 --> 00:37:57,959
See the one we planted
when you were born.

526
00:37:58,729 --> 00:38:01,459
Mary Liz's, Scottie's.

527
00:38:03,234 --> 00:38:05,065
Some people are leaving.

528
00:38:05,269 --> 00:38:08,261
The Peeblers, the Hoffers,
Dr. Jenson.

529
00:38:08,873 --> 00:38:10,773
Think we should leave?

530
00:38:11,476 --> 00:38:13,637
Talking about Northern Canada.

531
00:38:13,845 --> 00:38:15,938
Survival camps.

532
00:38:16,147 --> 00:38:19,241
- How are they gonna get there?
- I don't know.

533
00:38:21,953 --> 00:38:24,148
What do you think we should do?

534
00:38:26,824 --> 00:38:29,987
Mr. Abhart, he lets me watch.

535
00:38:30,228 --> 00:38:33,720
I run errands. I ride my bike.

536
00:38:35,466 --> 00:38:39,994
Mary Liz has her piano lessons,
and Dad could still come.

537
00:38:40,438 --> 00:38:42,065
Yes.

538
00:38:44,542 --> 00:38:46,942
And this is our home.

539
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,545
Go on, you two run on ahead.

540
00:39:20,611 --> 00:39:22,806
<i>Scottie's tree.</i>

541
00:39:25,316 --> 00:39:27,511
<i>I can't write today.</i>

542
00:39:32,056 --> 00:39:34,286
Dance, pipe and skip.

543
00:39:34,525 --> 00:39:37,858
Dance fast into the mountains.
Dance.

544
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,862
They're gone.

545
00:39:44,068 --> 00:39:47,799
He's done it, by gadfry!
Come out, citizens.

546
00:39:48,005 --> 00:39:49,836
Come out.

547
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:54,235
I'll accept thou promised payment
of 1,000 guilders,

548
00:39:54,445 --> 00:39:57,676
for I have saved your town
from the plague of rats.

549
00:39:57,882 --> 00:40:00,146
You play wonderful music.

550
00:40:00,351 --> 00:40:03,445
But what rats? I see no rats.

551
00:40:03,654 --> 00:40:07,920
I will pay you 1 guilder
out of the kindness of my heart.

552
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:12,220
Thou made a promise.
Thou now is forgetting.

553
00:40:12,463 --> 00:40:16,399
You're not going to be difficult, now,
are you, Piper?

554
00:40:16,601 --> 00:40:20,469
Thou is gonna be sorry.
Next time I'll play a different tune.

555
00:40:21,038 --> 00:40:24,439
Play away, I love music.

556
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:35,248
Lisa, who was supposed to be
our narrator, is sick.

557
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,153
Nancy is going to take her place.

558
00:40:38,956 --> 00:40:44,917
From schoolrooms and playgrounds,
from kitchens and nurseries,

559
00:40:45,129 --> 00:40:46,460
the children came.

560
00:40:46,797 --> 00:40:49,766
And their parents
could not stop them.

561
00:40:49,967 --> 00:40:51,764
The music of the Piper led them.

562
00:40:51,969 --> 00:40:56,963
Wait! I want to see islands!
I want to be strong

563
00:40:57,174 --> 00:40:59,642
and tall and powerful.

564
00:40:59,844 --> 00:41:01,778
I want ice cream.

565
00:41:01,979 --> 00:41:04,777
Piper! Piper! Piper!

566
00:41:16,927 --> 00:41:22,490
Oh, my son. He's gone. He's dead.
Oh, what have we done?

567
00:41:27,338 --> 00:41:29,670
Your children are not dead.

568
00:41:29,874 --> 00:41:31,068
They will return.

569
00:41:31,275 --> 00:41:35,871
They are just waiting
until the world deserves them.

570
00:42:38,275 --> 00:42:40,038
Hi, Phil.

571
00:42:40,778 --> 00:42:42,405
Phil?

572
00:42:44,215 --> 00:42:45,842
Phil.

573
00:42:48,953 --> 00:42:52,753
Oh, they said we should
conserve wood.

574
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:56,924
We had a tiny box,
but it wasn't big enough.

575
00:42:57,828 --> 00:43:00,228
We didn't have a bureau
the right size,

576
00:43:00,364 --> 00:43:02,662
so Henry gave this to me.

577
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,558
See?

578
00:43:05,569 --> 00:43:08,094
It's got tongue and groove.

579
00:43:08,806 --> 00:43:10,569
It's a real antique.

580
00:43:12,676 --> 00:43:14,576
And she'll fit in.

581
00:43:14,779 --> 00:43:17,111
She'll fit in here.

582
00:43:23,454 --> 00:43:25,922
We thought we were so lucky.

583
00:43:26,991 --> 00:43:30,859
It didn't seem like there'd be
any more bombs.

584
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:35,626
Then Suzie had to get sick.

585
00:43:37,601 --> 00:43:40,900
Of course, I tried to tell Cathy
that we're young.

586
00:43:41,539 --> 00:43:44,007
We could have another baby.

587
00:43:45,075 --> 00:43:48,101
You were so helpful to Cathy,
nursing.

588
00:43:50,848 --> 00:43:54,375
Cathy was so proud
she had plenty of milk.

589
00:43:56,821 --> 00:43:59,790
We gave her water, but we boiled it.

590
00:44:02,493 --> 00:44:04,484
Tell Cathy...

591
00:44:05,796 --> 00:44:07,764
Tell Cathy we love her.

592
00:44:20,211 --> 00:44:21,974
<i>March 8th.</i>

593
00:44:22,813 --> 00:44:25,976
<i>I write this to try and keep</i>
<i>my sanity.</i>

594
00:44:26,183 --> 00:44:28,174
<i>What's left.</i>

595
00:44:29,086 --> 00:44:31,953
<i>What if the baby is the lucky one?</i>

596
00:44:33,224 --> 00:44:35,215
I want it back.

597
00:44:36,527 --> 00:44:38,461
- Give it to me.
- Mary Liz!

598
00:44:38,662 --> 00:44:40,289
He can't have it
and you can't have it!

599
00:44:40,531 --> 00:44:42,089
- You can't do it!
- I'll do what I want!

600
00:44:42,333 --> 00:44:44,358
- Not that!
- She's hungry.

601
00:44:44,568 --> 00:44:46,160
- I'm hungry, you're hungry,
- I don't care!

602
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:48,668
- Scott's hungry!
- We're feeding him, aren't we?

603
00:44:48,873 --> 00:44:50,238
I won't have fighting!

604
00:44:50,441 --> 00:44:53,001
She was feeding a cat.
A stray cat.

605
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:54,472
- Mary Liz.
- I don't care.

606
00:44:54,678 --> 00:44:57,408
- I've always wanted a cat.
- We have to ration food.

607
00:44:57,615 --> 00:45:00,015
I don't care.

608
00:45:00,885 --> 00:45:03,410
And Larry is a part of our family now.

609
00:45:03,621 --> 00:45:05,680
What's the matter anyway?
Why are we bothering?

610
00:45:06,056 --> 00:45:08,820
Mary Liz, I won't have you
talk like that.

611
00:45:09,059 --> 00:45:11,391
I knew it.
I knew you'd side with Brad.

612
00:45:11,829 --> 00:45:13,160
You always side with Brad.

613
00:45:13,731 --> 00:45:15,756
He's not so great.

614
00:45:32,816 --> 00:45:35,717
- Mary Liz.
- Don't come in.

615
00:45:38,455 --> 00:45:40,446
Don't come in.

616
00:45:42,726 --> 00:45:44,694
Don't come near me.

617
00:45:48,265 --> 00:45:49,755
Don't.

618
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,128
- Sweetie.
- I just wanna die.

619
00:45:56,907 --> 00:45:58,602
Don't.

620
00:46:06,083 --> 00:46:08,210
Don't you do it.

621
00:46:11,055 --> 00:46:13,250
I want my daddy.

622
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:18,794
Don't!

623
00:46:19,163 --> 00:46:21,154
I miss him too.

624
00:46:25,402 --> 00:46:27,165
Mommy.

625
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:19,351
- Have you seen Scottie?
- No.

626
00:47:27,097 --> 00:47:28,428
Carol...

627
00:47:28,632 --> 00:47:32,068
...I think you'd better come with me.
- What's the matter?

628
00:47:44,148 --> 00:47:45,581
He said he was running away.

629
00:47:45,783 --> 00:47:49,116
I tried to stop him,
but he wouldn't let me.

630
00:47:59,563 --> 00:48:01,724
Hey, there, little man.

631
00:48:02,633 --> 00:48:04,328
Where did you come from?

632
00:48:05,436 --> 00:48:07,370
Oh, I don't know.

633
00:48:09,673 --> 00:48:11,538
What are you doing?

634
00:48:12,576 --> 00:48:15,204
- My treasure.
- Your bottom drawer?

635
00:48:15,879 --> 00:48:18,109
There's not enough food
for them anymore.

636
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:22,118
I'm running away. I hate fighting.

637
00:48:23,087 --> 00:48:25,920
You've been known to get in a few
yourself, stubborn man.

638
00:48:26,156 --> 00:48:29,489
- No more.
- Where will you go?

639
00:48:33,597 --> 00:48:36,259
Maybe I'll find Dad.

640
00:48:39,036 --> 00:48:40,765
If you did...

641
00:48:41,371 --> 00:48:42,668
...what would you do?

642
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,972
I can't know.

643
00:48:46,343 --> 00:48:47,742
You tell me.

644
00:48:49,146 --> 00:48:52,673
Well, you could see the mountains
and rivers.

645
00:48:53,417 --> 00:48:55,385
You could see the cities.

646
00:48:56,453 --> 00:48:58,216
You could come back here.

647
00:48:58,755 --> 00:49:00,950
Would I be scared there too?

648
00:49:03,994 --> 00:49:07,191
We're all scared a little
now and then.

649
00:49:07,764 --> 00:49:09,197
I don't like it.

650
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:11,767
I don't either.

651
00:49:12,035 --> 00:49:14,833
- At all.
- I know.

652
00:49:15,305 --> 00:49:18,934
- Tell it to go away.
- I can't.

653
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,295
Where are you going?

654
00:49:46,803 --> 00:49:49,067
We can't stay here anymore.

655
00:49:50,374 --> 00:49:52,001
We'll write to you.

656
00:49:52,209 --> 00:49:53,676
There's nothing left for us here.

657
00:49:53,877 --> 00:49:55,811
- Ever since the baby...
- Our parents, we...

658
00:49:56,013 --> 00:49:57,742
We have to get away.

659
00:49:57,948 --> 00:50:00,007
We'll find a safe place.

660
00:50:00,217 --> 00:50:02,481
We won't stop until we do.

661
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:07,288
We'll come back,
just as soon as we can.

662
00:50:08,926 --> 00:50:10,450
Good luck.

663
00:50:10,694 --> 00:50:12,457
Bye, Carol.

664
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:14,761
Bye, Carol.

665
00:50:37,187 --> 00:50:39,815
CQ, CQ, CQ,

666
00:50:40,023 --> 00:50:42,856
this is Whiskey Six Delta November
calling.

667
00:50:43,093 --> 00:50:45,789
Henry Abhart here
in Hamlin, California.

668
00:50:46,029 --> 00:50:48,862
This is Hamlin calling
and carefully tuning.

669
00:50:49,066 --> 00:50:50,294
Can you hear me?

670
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,195
Looking for calls.

671
00:50:52,402 --> 00:50:55,633
CQ, CQ, CQ.

672
00:50:58,475 --> 00:51:00,136
Brad.

673
00:51:00,544 --> 00:51:02,307
Yes, sir?

674
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,348
I told the police chief
you were talking to Greenland.

675
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:09,542
He says his radio will be
working again soon.

676
00:51:11,355 --> 00:51:12,549
He always says that.

677
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:15,385
Do you want me to deliver
any other messages?

678
00:51:15,626 --> 00:51:17,184
Well...

679
00:51:17,427 --> 00:51:20,954
...Rosemary's been walking
the neighborhood, doing things.

680
00:51:21,198 --> 00:51:24,031
Going from house to house,
checking on people,

681
00:51:24,234 --> 00:51:25,963
seeing if there's anything to do.

682
00:51:26,603 --> 00:51:29,231
Right now she's not feeling
as good as she should.

683
00:51:29,806 --> 00:51:33,799
And maybe for the next couple
of days, what you could do

684
00:51:34,011 --> 00:51:38,539
would be to take your bike
and stand in for her.

685
00:51:39,383 --> 00:51:40,975
I'll do it.

686
00:51:41,885 --> 00:51:43,546
Brad.

687
00:51:44,187 --> 00:51:47,645
- Yes, sir.
- There's one other thing.

688
00:51:48,625 --> 00:51:51,093
I can't raise Santa Rosa.

689
00:52:05,275 --> 00:52:07,539
<i>March 23rd.</i>

690
00:52:08,178 --> 00:52:11,375
<i>Mary Liz is practicing a new piece.</i>

691
00:52:12,316 --> 00:52:15,114
<i>Larry has stopped talking,</i>
<i>and Brad...</i>

692
00:52:15,319 --> 00:52:17,549
<i>Brad never rests.</i>

693
00:52:19,256 --> 00:52:22,384
<i>At least 1,300 have died.</i>

694
00:52:27,698 --> 00:52:31,498
The hospital is still open
for emergency services.

695
00:52:31,702 --> 00:52:34,500
There's a minimal staff on duty
24 hours.

696
00:52:35,405 --> 00:52:37,999
I noticed we lost our garbage pickup
this week.

697
00:52:38,542 --> 00:52:40,772
Well, there won't be any more.
It can't be managed.

698
00:52:43,714 --> 00:52:45,477
One more thing.

699
00:52:45,682 --> 00:52:46,876
Please,

700
00:52:47,084 --> 00:52:49,109
any burials.

701
00:52:50,921 --> 00:52:53,185
I want you to do them carefully.

702
00:52:56,259 --> 00:52:58,056
Darryl, how about the police?

703
00:53:04,368 --> 00:53:08,327
My men are on duty
and they'll remain there.

704
00:53:08,839 --> 00:53:10,534
The...

705
00:53:11,108 --> 00:53:13,167
...manpower has been depleted.

706
00:53:13,377 --> 00:53:18,974
The communications system
will be repaired.

707
00:53:21,318 --> 00:53:23,047
Order...

708
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,117
...will be maintained.

709
00:53:27,758 --> 00:53:30,454
- Darryl.
- Please sit down.

710
00:53:31,928 --> 00:53:34,795
Sit down. It's all right.

711
00:53:35,399 --> 00:53:37,367
It's all right.

712
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:12,563
Remember that skunk in Yosemite?

713
00:54:12,869 --> 00:54:14,564
Yes.

714
00:54:17,941 --> 00:54:20,000
Grandma's house?

715
00:54:21,211 --> 00:54:23,543
- Yes.
- The smell.

716
00:54:26,049 --> 00:54:29,143
Remember the bathtub
with clawed feet?

717
00:54:34,324 --> 00:54:37,293
The morning I walked in
on you and Dad?

718
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:41,457
Yes.

719
00:54:44,234 --> 00:54:46,134
What's it like?

720
00:54:46,436 --> 00:54:48,563
What's what like?

721
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:50,939
Making love.

722
00:54:51,808 --> 00:54:54,174
Don't play mother with me.

723
00:54:55,245 --> 00:54:57,338
That's what I am.

724
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:02,318
What's it like?

725
00:55:04,554 --> 00:55:08,684
I was so ignorant as a girl.

726
00:55:08,925 --> 00:55:12,224
Worried about it. So full of fantasy.

727
00:55:13,563 --> 00:55:18,626
I thought some man would come along
and sweep me off my feet.

728
00:55:20,036 --> 00:55:22,095
And your father...

729
00:55:23,073 --> 00:55:25,598
...he wasn't at all
what I was looking for.

730
00:55:27,177 --> 00:55:29,475
Not the size or shape,

731
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:33,080
or what he did exactly,
I still don't know.

732
00:55:36,653 --> 00:55:39,019
When you love someone,

733
00:55:39,222 --> 00:55:42,817
you wanna be as close to them
as you can get.

734
00:55:44,861 --> 00:55:46,988
You make love...

735
00:55:47,497 --> 00:55:50,660
...and you feel almost like
the same body.

736
00:55:52,302 --> 00:55:54,668
Like it was intended.

737
00:55:55,572 --> 00:55:59,030
You have a space,
and that person fills it up.

738
00:56:02,178 --> 00:56:05,909
We would fight.
We wouldn't listen to each other.

739
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:09,218
We'd miss...

740
00:56:09,419 --> 00:56:11,148
...thoughts.

741
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:17,588
We'd miss goodbyes.

742
00:56:19,229 --> 00:56:21,220
But sometimes...

743
00:56:23,199 --> 00:56:25,167
...most times,

744
00:56:25,368 --> 00:56:27,598
there was this feeling,

745
00:56:27,804 --> 00:56:31,035
and I couldn't wait for him
to be here with me.

746
00:56:35,111 --> 00:56:37,602
Everyone's always alone.

747
00:56:37,814 --> 00:56:39,805
And yet...

748
00:56:40,517 --> 00:56:42,712
...there can be this gift.

749
00:56:44,254 --> 00:56:46,552
This making of miracles.

750
00:56:47,624 --> 00:56:48,989
You.

751
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:52,119
Not for me.

752
00:57:31,768 --> 00:57:33,565
You're going in the water.

753
00:57:35,338 --> 00:57:37,169
There we go.

754
00:57:37,374 --> 00:57:39,808
That's a boy.

755
00:57:40,243 --> 00:57:42,143
Okay.

756
00:57:44,514 --> 00:57:46,414
Shit.

757
00:57:52,889 --> 00:57:57,258
Just rest your head against here,
all right, darling? That's a boy.

758
00:58:09,172 --> 00:58:11,436
You all right, darling?

759
00:58:12,475 --> 00:58:14,306
Sweetie?

760
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:29,324
There.

761
00:58:41,871 --> 00:58:46,638
Larry, thank you.
There. There's your bear.

762
00:58:49,145 --> 00:58:51,045
Okay.

763
00:58:53,316 --> 00:58:55,216
All right, darling.

764
00:58:56,319 --> 00:59:00,153
Okay. That's my boy.

765
00:59:01,024 --> 00:59:03,458
That's my big boy.

766
00:59:19,142 --> 00:59:22,543
<i>I had a little nut tree</i>

767
00:59:22,746 --> 00:59:25,647
<i>Nothing would it bear</i>

768
00:59:25,849 --> 00:59:28,716
- <i>But a silver nutmeg</i>

774
01:01:42,085 --> 01:01:43,677
I still can't find it.

775
01:01:43,887 --> 01:01:46,549
- Mom!
- I can't find it! I want that bear!

776
01:01:46,756 --> 01:01:48,849
It's time, Mom.
Don't you think we should get it done?

777
01:01:49,092 --> 01:01:50,753
No.

778
01:01:50,994 --> 01:01:55,294
- I'm sorry I'm late. Let's begin.
- Not yet.

779
01:01:56,132 --> 01:01:58,999
- God said...
- Forget God.

780
01:01:59,202 --> 01:02:02,660
No one is touching him. No one
is burying him until I find his bear!

781
01:02:02,872 --> 01:02:05,636
Do you hear me? You understand?

782
01:02:21,291 --> 01:02:24,158
Whosoever believeth in me...

783
01:02:25,461 --> 01:02:27,759
...shall never die.

784
01:03:26,522 --> 01:03:30,583
<i>It's me again. Can you believe it?</i>
<i>Double scratch.</i>

785
01:03:30,827 --> 01:03:32,852
<i>I'm gonna have to stay</i>
<i>in San Francisco after all.</i>

786
01:03:33,096 --> 01:03:34,859
<i>All these false alarms.</i>

787
01:03:35,064 --> 01:03:40,366
<i>I'll make it up to you, I promise.</i>
<i>Give the kids a kiss, and love to you.</i>

788
01:04:44,133 --> 01:04:46,624
Well, what is it, young man?

789
01:04:46,836 --> 01:04:48,701
Are you all right?

790
01:04:48,905 --> 01:04:53,535
I'm perfectly well, thank you.

791
01:04:53,810 --> 01:04:56,108
Just resting.

792
01:04:56,813 --> 01:05:02,649
- Next time, knock. Thank you.
- I did.

793
01:05:02,852 --> 01:05:09,155
Where is Mary Elizabeth?
She's late for her lesson.

794
01:05:14,263 --> 01:05:18,199
My grandchildren
were the same way.

795
01:05:18,501 --> 01:05:24,406
They loved to watch me.

796
01:05:27,210 --> 01:05:32,648
- Here.
- No, thank you, I can do it myself.

797
01:05:43,759 --> 01:05:47,195
- Why were you late?
- I wasn't.

798
01:05:47,396 --> 01:05:51,025
Don't be again. Shall we begin?

799
01:05:51,234 --> 01:05:53,361
You have been practicing?

800
01:05:53,569 --> 01:05:55,093
- Yes.
- Good. Now,

801
01:05:55,304 --> 01:05:57,636
let me show you

802
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:01,799
the width of the fingers

803
01:06:02,645 --> 01:06:06,547
and the strength of the chord,

804
01:06:06,749 --> 01:06:10,150
I want in that left hand.

805
01:06:35,244 --> 01:06:37,644
<i>Sunday, I think.</i>

806
01:06:38,214 --> 01:06:40,580
<i>Watching Brad,</i>

807
01:06:40,917 --> 01:06:43,147
<i>the man he's become.</i>

808
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:46,911
<i>The man he'll not live to be.</i>

809
01:06:53,696 --> 01:06:56,256
<i>Larry left us today.</i>

810
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:00,397
<i>He just crawled into a ball and died.</i>

811
01:07:00,870 --> 01:07:03,202
<i>His mother was my friend.</i>

812
01:07:20,022 --> 01:07:21,148
Hey, what are you doing?

813
01:07:21,958 --> 01:07:24,518
That's our food, Billdocker!

814
01:07:27,296 --> 01:07:28,763
Let go!

815
01:07:31,334 --> 01:07:32,892
Oh, no! No, no!

816
01:07:38,474 --> 01:07:40,601
Not my bike!

817
01:07:40,876 --> 01:07:42,935
No!

818
01:07:43,879 --> 01:07:45,676
Damn.

819
01:08:32,194 --> 01:08:34,458
<i>... home every day</i>

820
01:08:34,664 --> 01:08:39,431
- <i>And I'll send all my loving to you</i>
- Come on.

821
01:09:34,690 --> 01:09:37,158
<i>Never in the history of the world</i>
<i>has there been a boy</i>

822
01:09:37,393 --> 01:09:38,553
<i>as slow as you are.</i>

823
01:09:38,794 --> 01:09:42,161
<i>Now, come on, Brad,</i>
<i>move your dead ass. Let's go.</i>

824
01:10:48,564 --> 01:10:51,397
- What are you doing in my chair?
- Henry!

825
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,363
Oh, it's "Henry" now, is it?

826
01:10:53,569 --> 01:10:55,434
Mr. Abhart.

827
01:10:59,742 --> 01:11:01,573
What you do is...

828
01:11:01,977 --> 01:11:04,241
Call me what you want.

829
01:11:04,713 --> 01:11:08,274
What you do is get me a new voice.

830
01:11:09,218 --> 01:11:11,709
How is it out there?

831
01:11:13,355 --> 01:11:17,849
That's what I thought.
Same as in here, you know.

832
01:11:18,093 --> 01:11:21,085
I keep losing things,
and I can't find them.

833
01:11:21,330 --> 01:11:25,061
They go away
and they don't come back.

834
01:11:26,235 --> 01:11:27,896
So...

835
01:11:29,472 --> 01:11:31,133
Come here.

836
01:11:33,342 --> 01:11:37,244
Well, I'm not giving up
on this old world yet.

837
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,708
So Rosemary's gone...

838
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:43,711
...but I'll be here.

839
01:11:50,493 --> 01:11:55,590
CQ. CQ. CQ.

840
01:11:56,232 --> 01:11:57,859
<i>CQ.</i>

841
01:12:08,210 --> 01:12:10,508
<i>I don't know what day it is.</i>

842
01:12:10,713 --> 01:12:12,647
<i>I've lost track.</i>

843
01:12:13,516 --> 01:12:17,316
<i>Henry thinks some miracle</i>
<i>may save us yet.</i>

844
01:12:18,954 --> 01:12:20,649
<i>He's foolish.</i>

845
01:12:24,093 --> 01:12:26,459
<i>The cemetery's full.</i>

846
01:12:27,897 --> 01:12:30,229
<i>They're burning the bodies.</i>

847
01:13:36,098 --> 01:13:38,362
<i>My first-born.</i>

848
01:13:38,767 --> 01:13:40,632
<i>My daughter.</i>

849
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:03,421
Is that Mike?

850
01:14:12,067 --> 01:14:13,864
Hiroshi?

851
01:14:15,904 --> 01:14:17,997
Hiroshi!

852
01:14:21,543 --> 01:14:23,033
Hiroshi?

853
01:14:23,646 --> 01:14:25,841
Hi, Brad.

854
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:31,180
- Hiroshi.
- How are you, Brad?

855
01:14:31,387 --> 01:14:33,981
- Pretty good.
- What are you doing, Brad?

856
01:14:34,223 --> 01:14:35,656
I came to take you to my house.

857
01:14:35,891 --> 01:14:37,153
- I go to your house?
- Yeah.

858
01:14:37,393 --> 01:14:39,327
- Okay.
- We're gonna go for a ride.

859
01:14:39,528 --> 01:14:42,463
- Let's go on a ride.
- Wanna get the stuff in the bike?

860
01:14:42,665 --> 01:14:45,600
- Nope...
- Yeah. Let's go.

861
01:14:45,801 --> 01:14:47,530
Okay.

862
01:14:55,144 --> 01:14:58,807
So done much fishing?

863
01:14:59,548 --> 01:15:02,483
All right. Put this right in here.

864
01:15:02,985 --> 01:15:05,545
- Hey, your fishing pole.
- Oh, my fishing pole?

865
01:15:05,754 --> 01:15:07,813
- Okay.
- Wanna go fishing?

866
01:15:08,023 --> 01:15:10,548
- Go fishing? Yeah.
- Okay.

867
01:15:10,793 --> 01:15:13,591
- Fishing?
- Fishing.

868
01:15:16,532 --> 01:15:17,931
I'm taking you home

869
01:15:18,133 --> 01:15:20,567
because I don't think your dad's
gonna be coming back.

870
01:15:20,769 --> 01:15:22,600
Oh, my God.

871
01:15:24,707 --> 01:15:26,641
This is pretty good, huh?

872
01:15:27,142 --> 01:15:29,235
You pedaling? All right!

873
01:15:29,445 --> 01:15:32,209
Here we go. This is good.

874
01:15:33,649 --> 01:15:35,549
We got your fishing pole,
we'll go fishing.

875
01:15:35,751 --> 01:15:38,652
We'll have a party
with all this food, huh?

876
01:15:39,021 --> 01:15:40,613
Here we go.

877
01:15:42,591 --> 01:15:44,525
You're doing the job. All right!

878
01:17:24,059 --> 01:17:26,789
CQ, CQ, CQ.

879
01:17:29,231 --> 01:17:31,199
Delta Six...

880
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:35,461
This is Whiskeys Delta November
calling.

881
01:17:35,671 --> 01:17:38,970
Henry Abhart for Hamlin, California.

882
01:17:39,174 --> 01:17:44,441
This is Brad... Brad Wetherly
for Henry Abhart, Hamlin.

883
01:17:46,481 --> 01:17:49,314
This is Hamlin looking for a call.

884
01:17:49,852 --> 01:17:51,911
Looking for a call.

885
01:17:52,621 --> 01:17:55,317
Hamlin, looking for a call.

886
01:19:14,036 --> 01:19:16,004
Henry's dead.

887
01:20:03,285 --> 01:20:08,723
Who did this?
Goddamn you.

888
01:22:51,686 --> 01:22:53,381
I'm ready.

889
01:22:56,758 --> 01:22:58,919
Battery still works.

890
01:23:21,683 --> 01:23:23,275
Brad.

891
01:23:24,052 --> 01:23:25,679
I know, Mom.

892
01:23:28,456 --> 01:23:30,014
Brad, l...

893
01:23:30,825 --> 01:23:32,759
I can't do it.

894
01:24:01,256 --> 01:24:03,349
We forgot presents.

895
01:24:12,667 --> 01:24:14,726
Where did you find it?

896
01:24:23,945 --> 01:24:25,742
What do we do now?

897
01:24:27,182 --> 01:24:28,740
Make a wish.

898
01:24:29,084 --> 01:24:30,676
What do we wish for, Mom?

899
01:24:33,722 --> 01:24:36,350
That we remember it all.

900
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:40,525
The good and the awful.

901
01:24:43,832 --> 01:24:46,824
The way we finally lived.

902
01:24:49,137 --> 01:24:50,968
That we never gave up.

903
01:24:54,876 --> 01:24:58,642
That we will last, to be here...

904
01:25:02,384 --> 01:25:04,909
...to deserve the children.
