Screenplay and director

18
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,114
We were supposed
to shoot this film last year.

19
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,833
Somewhere in Poland.

20
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,793
Where there's a river, a
bridge, a landing stage.

21
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,798
I remember coming to Andrzej
to tell him I couldn't do it.

22
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,752
That I had to be in Warsaw.

23
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,432
Actually, I thought back then

24
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,394
we could still do it somewhere close.

25
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,195
I didn't know what was ahead of us.

26
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,911
I remember the twitch in Andrzej's face
when I told him about Edward's chemo.

27
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,429
That I couldn't leave him just then,

28
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,353
that he was sick.

29
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,195
He said it's ok, that he understands,
that he'll play it by ear

30
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,399
they'll look for a location
somewhere close.

31
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,875
Come to think of it, it wouldn't
have been possible at all.

32
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,278
I didn't realize...

33
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,353
...how intense
the following days would be.

34
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,032
I didn't believe things would turn bad,
then get worse.

35
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,032
Doctors said:

36
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,595
"try to live your life as usual."

37
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,518
He didn't have the energy.

38
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,312
He couldn't walk.

39
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,517
I kept taking photos.

40
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,798
Just in case.

41
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,312
He let me,
he was even pleased.

42
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,192
I thought to myself how your
profession affects the way you think.

43
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,639
Cameraman.

44
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,035
He knew how much it matters

45
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,549
to seize the expression,
the image,

46
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,553
the moment.

47
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,673
I often took photographs
of him when he was asleep.

48
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,634
He would always wake up after a while
and smile at me ironically.

49
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,550
I don't know what I felt back then.

50
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,231
I wasn't filled with panic.

51
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,828
Calm.

52
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,432
I took him to his brain CT-scan.

53
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,473
And in his brain there were just those
three grains of sand, not more.

54
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,433
Nothing else.

55
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,879
And they aren't changing,
aren't getting any bigger.

56
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,472
Nothing is changing.

57
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,951
He shows no more mets.

58
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,435
Or maybe these aren't even mets.

59
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,918
We laughed a lot.
I came up with redecoration.

60
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,672
We painted the rooms.
I photographed him in empty rooms.

61
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,354
When I was driving him home,
from chemo,

62
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,518
he had to pee about
ten times on the way.

63
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,996
We laughed about it.
He would stop wherever and pee.

64
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,112
I took photos of him
through the car windows.

65
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,634
Now I look at these pictures
all the time.

66
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,233
They are like a treasure to me now.

67
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,475
I haven't cancelled his mobile
number. I pay the subscription fee and

68
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,478
I've kept it for myself.
Sometimes I call him.

69
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,240
There's this message
he recorded by himself.

70
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,673
Sometimes I leave a message.
I always called him.

71
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,958
About anything.

72
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,470
About any problem and he
always knew how to rescue me.

73
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,352
The phone's still there,
waiting,

74
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,917
anyone can call.

75
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,590
"SWEET RUSH"

76
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,832
- From the beginning?
- That's right.

77
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,349
- That's the most important part.
- The most beautiful one.

78
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,120
Sweet rush has two kinds of fragrance.

79
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,115
When rubbed between two fingers,
its green ribbon, wrinkled in places...

80
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,316
Wrinkled on this side. That's right.

81
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,114
...gives off a smell,

82
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,235
a faint scent of water shadowed
by birch trees, as Slowacki says.

83
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,158
Yet, when one crushes its blade,

84
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,077
when one buries the nose in its groove,
lined as if with cotton wool,

85
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,391
apart from the fragrance of incense,

86
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,074
one will detect the smell of muddy loam,

87
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,510
rotting fish scales,

88
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,874
mud,

89
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,072
the aroma of death.

90
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,119
That fragrance
at the beginning of my life

91
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,551
blended with an image
of a violent death.

92
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,115
Marta lost her two sons during the German

93
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,278
occupation and she is
now extremely lonely.

94
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,869
Her husband, terribly busy.

95
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,395
Aside from working at the hospital,
he is also running an enormous surgery

96
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,275
for the townsfolk. Marta is very
much affected by her solitude.

97
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,115
It must be added, however,
that Marta never complains.

98
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,958
She never gives voice to her feelings.
She looks after the house diligently.

99
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,199
Receives phone calls, makes appointments
for patients and does her best

100
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,876
so that the weary doctor could
return to a house in order, peace.

101
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,559
Tatarak, take one.

102
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,629
Take a seat.

103
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,678
- Do you have the results?
- Yes, here they are.

104
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,593
Excuse me.

105
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,869
Something's wrong?

106
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,434
No. Why?

107
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,079
You look pale.

108
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,354
No. Maybe I just didn't
sleep well last night.

109
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,072
I'll have to examine you.

110
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,758
And don't even try to resist.

111
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,559
Are you in pain?

112
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,156
No, I'm not in pain.

113
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,158
I just don't feel well.

114
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,754
- Have you lost weight?
- Yes, I have.

115
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,909
How much?

116
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,914
Six kilos.

117
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,873
- Since when?
- Since two months ago.

118
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,629
X-ray.

119
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,074
Thank you.

120
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,518
- Here.
- Thank you.

121
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,350
And that?

122
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,232
How long have you had that?

123
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,990
It's been two weeks since I noticed.

124
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,633
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Because.

125
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,071
You've lost six kilos?

126
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,393
Maybe seven.

127
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,393
Breath in.

128
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,199
Hold your breath.

129
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,919
Good afternoon.

130
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,391
It's just a common cold.
You are a little weak.

131
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,079
I'm tired.

132
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,356
She may not live through the summer.

133
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,552
Are you going to tell her?

134
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,468
No.

135
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,714
Off you go.

136
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,951
Thank you for coming to see us...

137
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,919
Doctor, Doctor...

138
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,113
Next, please.

139
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,152
Why did you come?

140
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,638
I've grown old, I've changed.
You've come to see how Marta is doing?

141
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,513
Not at all... Why would you... Marta...

142
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,713
We've all changed, grown old.

143
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,388
You have too.

144
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,719
But so much time has passed.
Hard time.

145
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,319
Do any of our old acquaintances
keep in touch with you?

146
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,469
No, none. Whatsoever.

147
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,753
There was a time when they would call,
write. But now none whatsoever.

148
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,431
And not even one
of our old female friends?

149
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,913
Listen, is it true that,
after her last visit,

150
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,351
Tesia started telling tales
around Warsaw that there's

151
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,711
this Ibsenesque atmosphere in our house.

152
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,640
No, no, I haven't
heard anything of that kind.

153
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,268
Look.

154
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,077
That's the only thing they've
rebuilt after the war. That stage.

155
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,759
As if they knew people need a place
of entertainment to enjoy themselves.

156
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,235
That's the most important
thing right now.

157
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,548
But people need to enjoy themselves.
They want to.

158
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,320
Or they'd go mad
after all that's happened.

159
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,909
Don't tell me you go to dances.

160
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,556
No. Not to dances.

161
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,199
All townsfolk come over here
to enjoy themselves.

162
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,475
One comes over here to parade
about and to observe others.

163
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,191
I come here too, sometimes.

164
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,318
Or the only world I'd know would be
that of my husband's and his patients'.

165
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,195
And this is where our youth
comes to play about.

166
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,114
Look how...

167
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,952
...how beautiful they are,

168
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,914
how robust.

169
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,393
What are they drinking?

170
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,590
Oh, this is liquid fruit,

171
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,678
the local pride, our speciality.

172
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,269
- Would you like to taste it?
- Yes, please.

173
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,149
Wait a moment.

174
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,072
I do apologise, Madam.

175
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,315
But for Alina,
I would be entirely alone.

176
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,953
Janusz is in America,

177
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,435
Robert and Zbyszek in London.

178
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,669
Robert doesn't even think to come back.
He's afraid.

179
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,955
He says he'll come when the system
changes. And it'll never change.

180
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,991
So he'll never come back.

181
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,749
That's good.

182
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,109
Juice.

183
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,153
- It's just juice.
- Well, yes. And what did you think?

184
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,148
They'd probably like something stronger,
but they don't have any money.

185
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,515
- Do you know these people?
- Yes.

186
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,877
It's a small town. We know one another,
well... by sight.

187
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,752
It's a really small town.

188
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,749
Zbyszek's going to come.
His wife's English.

189
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,954
He'll come with her so I hope
they'll let him go back.

190
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,636
He's got two girls.

191
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,995
He works at the airport in London.
It's an easy job. He's a ground officer.

192
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,998
You may remember Janusz the best.

193
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,349
Remember when Janusz, on his own,
brought a tree for Christmas?

194
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,154
Do you remember that
Christmas before the war?

195
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,791
That was so joyful!
So much enjoyment,

196
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,919
so many children.

197
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,475
Your two, the three of mine.

198
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,877
Alina, and, well,
Henryk was still alive.

199
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,838
And Alina's fine.
Her husband's a commie.

200
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,713
I wonder if he'll let her
see her brother.

201
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,709
The girls rather yes,
but surely not the sister-in-law?

202
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,152
Dear God, what a time!

203
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,951
And the river flows...

204
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,839
Let's go now. Let's go.

205
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,154
Yes, he will see you.
What is your name?

206
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,676
All right. Please, do not worry.

207
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,110
Yes, he will certainly see you.
Thank you.

208
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,678
Hello, doctor's house.

209
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,949
No, I'm afraid not.
But he's on duty at the hospital.

210
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,838
Yes, if it's serious,
please go to he hospital.

211
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,117
Yes, yes, he will certainly
see you there, he's on duty.

212
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,359
What are you doing?

213
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,958
Do not go in there, please!

214
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,278
I'm sorry. I wanted to tidy the room.
Like you told me to, Madam.

215
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,951
I told you to tidy everywhere except
in that room. Haven't I told you that?

216
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,153
If I haven't, I'm telling you now.
Please, do not enter that room.

217
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,749
- I'm sorry.
- We do not go in there.

218
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,758
Here. Excuse me.

219
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,228
- See, they're looking at us...
- Because you always...

220
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,000
Like yesterday... with the fellows...
the whole town...

221
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,759
I expect you'll come
to Warsaw, like every year,

222
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,555
on 1 st August to visit the boys' grave.

223
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,798
Yes, yes, I'm planning to,
like every year.

224
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,958
Forgive me, Marta.

225
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,315
You have nothing to reproach
yourself with.

226
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,637
None of that was your fault.
Nor mine, nor anybody else's.

227
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,035
Nobody could have predicted
the uprising would break out.

228
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,232
Nobody could have predicted that.

229
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,431
But I couldn't stop them.

230
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,989
Nobody would've been able to.
Not even I. This is how we raised them.

231
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,074
I still see them
like it was yesterday...

232
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,875
I'm sorry.

233
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,676
How was your day? Was it all right?

234
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,949
It was fine.

235
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,759
I postponed that patient's
appointment to Monday.

236
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,709
Thank you.

237
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:46,629
He called three times.
Asked if it was for certain.

238
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,115
- Here, have some.
- No, thank you.

239
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,834
- Maybe you'll have some jam?
- No, thank you.

240
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,634
You know what,

241
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,389
I think I'll go to bed, all right?
I'm so tired. Excuse me.

242
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,752
- Good night.
- Good night.

243
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,554
- What time are you leaving?
- Early.

244
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,751
All right them. Have a good night.

245
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,912
Why, are you alone today?

246
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,237
No, no, please, sit down.
I'll sit down too.

247
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,075
Thank you.

248
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,589
It's such a lovely place, isn't it?

249
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,157
Why are you alone today?

250
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,433
Halinka has left.

251
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,958
And who is Halinka?

252
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,793
It doesn't matter.

253
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:24,637
She's a student and she
always knows better.

254
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,113
And I'm just a simple boy, after all...

255
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,512
- Are your parents alive?
- No, they aren't.

256
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,877
They died during the war.
My grandmother raised me.

257
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,311
She raised a splendid boy.

258
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,638
I'm sorry, I don't know
why I get such silly ideas.

259
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,429
- Where did you go to school?
- In Elblag.

260
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,517
I trained as a raftsman.

261
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,555
But wouldn't you like
to do something else?

262
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,590
Now you start talking like Halina.

263
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,236
I'm not meant to be anything else,
don't you see?

264
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,598
I'm a born raftsman - water inspector
and that's that.

265
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,671
And what does she want from you?

266
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,633
She wants me to read books

267
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,798
and walk with her in the moonlight,
along the river.

268
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,792
- And you would rather play bridge?
- Sure I would.

269
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,510
I saw you two at the stage
the other day.

270
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,479
Exactly.

271
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,312
I'd also prefer you to learn
and read books.

272
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:56,316
I do read sometimes but there's
nowhere I could get books.

273
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:00,754
I can't buy them. And, what's worse,
I have to send cash to my grandmother.

274
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,676
Why don't you take books from me?

275
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,553
We have some books.

276
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,191
My husband buys and has them delivered,
but he doesn't have time to read.

277
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,917
They just lie there uncut.

278
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,549
Thank you.

279
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,956
So when are you going to come over?

280
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,755
She just thinks she's
so high and mighty.

281
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,999
She'll be a university lecturer and
tells me that she's ashamed to be

282
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,476
with a blockhead like me. I don't mind
being a blockhead.

283
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:44,116
I don't need any science to live.
I feel good the way I am.

284
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,992
If she wants to marry me, that's fine.
And if she doesn't, that's fine too.

285
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,309
But you are too young to get married.

286
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,598
Too young, too young.

287
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,955
That's exactly what she says.
But I can't change that!

288
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,756
Why don't you come over tomorrow.

289
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,639
- Do you know where we live?
- I do, I do.

290
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,949
- Right behind Krakowska Gate.
- Everybody knows where the doctor lives.

291
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,279
Do you swim?

292
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,869
I do.

293
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,036
I don't know anyone I could swim with.

294
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,274
Maybe we could meet
one day at the river.

295
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,039
I must go now.

296
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,632
But do come over.

297
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,759
This one's made with an oak leaf.

298
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,679
This one's with an oak leaf.
This one with currant.

299
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,035
And she said her pressure
was going up.

300
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,999
Here, this one is with cherry.

301
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,757
Horrible, so sour these ones.

302
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,792
They taste the same.

303
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,917
And every year when
I make pickles she comes over

304
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,111
to get something for blood pressure.

305
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,597
Lets' go. You shouldn't be sitting here.

306
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,199
Don't you feel any shame?

307
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,316
Aren't you ashamed to be alive?

308
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,432
Because I'm ashamed of myself thinking
of all the deceased, of our sons...

309
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,676
There are so many young people
around now, and they're gone...

310
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,831
They wouldn't be so young any more.

311
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,591
They would probably be married.

312
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,270
Apart from them, there would be
some young women around our house.

313
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,435
How awful!

314
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,117
I detest young women.

315
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,352
That's so pompous.

316
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,790
Let's go. You needn't get so upset.

317
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,595
I am always filled
with such terrible shame

318
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,314
when I see such a young life around me.

319
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,557
Youth is shameless.

320
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,272
You are forgetting one thing.

321
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,710
Life turns into death so easily.

322
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,189
Good night.

323
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,236
I didn't believe he would die,
but he did die.

324
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,438
It's been seven months
and I still don't believe it.

325
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,111
He told me that...
that there was something in his lungs,

326
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,351
it was on the stairs, in our home,
after breakfast, casually,

327
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,630
while he was walking by
on the stairs.

328
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,432
Whaaat! - I shouted.

329
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,833
How do you know?!

330
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,591
Calm down, quiet.

331
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,716
Don't shout.
The kids will hear.

332
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,791
I got the pictures. Chest X-ray.
I'm going to the lung CT-scan today.

333
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,948
What time?

334
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,519
- In the afternoon.
- When will you get the result?

335
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,516
- Right after that or in the evening.
- But I'm playing.

336
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,270
Take it easy. I'll call you.

337
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,553
We met later that day at the Theatre.

338
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,748
I don't know...

339
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,237
He brought some tiles,
went to get some pipes.

340
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,558
I called him in the afternoon.

341
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,797
- Have you got the result?
- No, it will be ready tomorrow.

342
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,433
The doctor wasn't there.

343
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,871
I won't be able to pick it up tomorrow,
the plumber is coming.

344
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,389
He'd been building the theatre
for two years.

345
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,916
He stayed up with the workers at night,
while I went home to be with kids.

346
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:05,391
The Theatre had been open for some time,
but he kept building it and coughing.

347
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,155
He told me it was an allergy to dust.

348
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,949
On 10th June he took his tests.

349
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,076
I got off the phone,
got into the car...

350
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,151
...and went to the lab.

351
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,634
There were only some doorman
and some lab assistant there. I said:

352
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:36,072
I'm begging you, please, help me.
Show me my husband's results.

353
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:39,159
No, I can't. I can't,
not even to a wife.

354
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,954
Personal data protection.
I can't.

355
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:49,158
Anyway, the results aren't ready yet.
The doctor was absent today.

356
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,876
But, please, show them to me.

357
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,550
After all, you do know all about that.

358
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,872
I can't. I can't,
not even to a wife.

359
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,320
It was a bearded man, in the afternoon?

360
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,317
Yes, Edward Klosinski.

361
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,838
He left. He came back.

362
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,791
It's very bad - he said.

363
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,114
Very bad.

364
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,077
We'll get it ready as first tomorrow.
You may collect it then.

365
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,032
What time can we do that?

366
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,159
From 8, but you may
come earlier than that.

367
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:37,394
I called. I said: Edward, I've seen it,
I've seen the printout.

368
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,029
We'll get the results tomorrow
morning, you can do that from 7.

369
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,839
I hate that.

370
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,830
I'll sue them!
Some old hag comes over,

371
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:51,635
they show her whatever she wants.
They wouldn't even tell me anything!

372
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:55,594
It's disgusting. I hate that!
They'll show you whatever you want!

373
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,956
Yes, because my name is Krystyna Janda.
I know. That's terrible.

374
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,115
Tomorrow we'll get
the results together.

375
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,151
You can get them yourself.

376
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,275
I can't, the plumber
is coming over.

377
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,913
They'll give it to you.

378
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,552
I went very early in the morning,
before opening.

379
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,071
The result was there, waiting.

380
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:31,351
They asked no questions, nothing,
not even my name, nothing.

381
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,834
They gave it to me.

382
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,755
I was holding that envelope in my hand

383
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,079
and walking towards
the car as if hypnotized.

384
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,553
I drove through the gate
and out into the street.

385
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,514
I found a shoulder to park
and opened the envelope.

386
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:58,510
A tumour 8 x 10 centimetres
in the left lung,

387
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,716
five shadows in the right one.

388
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,352
I was in shock. What shadows?

389
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,794
I called my doctor friend in Germany.

390
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,198
All she said was - Read it.
And then - I'm sorry.

391
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,592
But what are shadows?

392
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,794
Mets.

393
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,431
It's spread to both lungs.

394
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,356
Hang in there now.

395
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,278
I didn't call him.

396
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,759
I cried,

397
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,995
I screamed, I couldn't calm down.

398
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:54,638
And that was the only time when
I cried like that, I haven't ever since.

399
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,395
Quietly, when I was alone.
When I let myself off guard.

400
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,516
And I cry like that until today
when it slips out of control.

401
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,678
We met at the theatre.

402
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,310
He didn't ask me anything.
We got into the car and went to

403
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:22,035
the hospital on Plocka Street.
He had an appointment with a doctor,

404
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:26,518
who, as it happens, was a friend
of a friend we went skiing with.

405
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,958
Not a word on the way...

406
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,756
We drove in silence.

407
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,793
I didn't say anything.
He preferred not to ask.

408
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,991
He didn't ask about the result.

409
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,713
My mobile rang. Andrzej Wajda.
"Sweet Rush".

410
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,513
All the way to hospital
I talked on the phone.

411
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,589
That there's this assistant
who knows better than his master.

412
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,792
He's been giving me tips,
that there's always some youth

413
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,389
on the set who thinks they
know better than the director.

414
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,748
Andrzej was having doubts.
Edward kept quiet.

415
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,113
At the crossroads,

416
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,276
just before the turning into
Plocka Street, he suddenly said:

417
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,432
I'm a little scared.

418
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,199
I kept quiet.

419
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,198
He preferred not to ask.

420
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,230
We went into the doctors' office.

421
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,636
A pragmatic, calm doctor,

422
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,632
the kind we always trust,
took the envelope in his hand.

423
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,798
Edward sat with his back to the screen
where the doctor put up X-ray prints.

424
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,877
I sat facing all of this.

425
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,879
One glance was enough.
He looked at me.

426
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,275
He realised I knew everything.

427
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,760
Edward was sitting with his back
to the screen.

428
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,033
The doctor said:

429
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,990
Have you read the description, sir?

430
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,191
What else could he have said.

431
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,716
No, I didn't.
No, my wife has just collected it.

432
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,553
And then the doctor
started reading that analysis.

433
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,830
He preferred to read it.
What was he supposed to say.

434
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,554
When we fell silent,
Edward asked calmly:

435
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,273
What's your advice?

436
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,638
You still ought to continue
the treatment - he said.

437
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,877
He died on 5th January,

438
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,750
on Saturday at 3.10 pm.

439
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,469
Between one spoonful
of soup and another.

440
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,033
I was feeding him.

441
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,556
His veins were torn, so it was
impossible to set up the drip.

442
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,988
The doctor said to me:

443
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:32,513
if you put a teaspoonful of water
into your husband's mouth every minute,

444
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,718
you will hydrate him.

445
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,918
Every minute.

446
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,359
And he was patient.

447
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:49,154
I was sitting beside him
in the centre of the house,

448
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,351
his bed in the living room.

449
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,312
A special bed, oxygen.

450
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,116
The hum of oxygen being supplied...

451
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:06,315
In fact, from the moment I brought him
home that last time,

452
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,712
on Monday, New Year's Day,
I didn't leave that room.

453
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,956
I was there for him all the time.

454
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,277
I slept beside him on the sofa, which
was too short and uncomfortable.

455
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:22,631
I said to myself:
It's just for the time being.

456
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,837
He'll get better and we'll
move him upstairs to the bedroom.

457
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,511
I'll get through this somehow.

458
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,274
I'll never forget those five nights.

459
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,678
They were my nights.

460
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,673
What's the matter?

461
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,836
No, everything's all right.
Go back to sleep.

462
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,908
Yes?

463
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,198
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

464
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,628
Pretty flowers.

465
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,631
I've come to get something to read,

466
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,074
but I don't know what.

467
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:12,029
- Maybe something on Polish philology...
- Polish philology...

468
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,790
Halinka studies philology
so I thought

469
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,232
she might like it if I was
reading what she is.

470
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,039
She would be pleased.

471
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:29,831
The library's over there, but we may be
more comfortable here.

472
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,473
How about a novel?

473
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,234
A novel...

474
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,956
A novel sounds all right.
But one where they talk a lot.

475
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,957
I don't like reading descriptions.

476
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,190
I suppose anything can be
said in conversation.

477
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:49,314
When I see there are only descriptions
in a book, I put it away immediately.

478
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,155
Here. Please, sit down.

479
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,079
Wait a moment.

480
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,712
How do you like this one?

481
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,880
<i>Ashes and Diamonds
by Jerzy Andrzejewski</i>

482
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:18,515
Do you really think that a dialogue
is enough to describe everything?

483
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,516
What about landscape, and our river?

484
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,713
It looks good.

485
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,917
What can one say about a river?

486
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,998
A river is a river,

487
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,589
there's nothing to talk about.
Water,

488
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:44,713
sweet rush...

489
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:52,999
Have you seen our garden? How beautiful
it is, how everything is blooming.

490
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,791
You see, when it comes to me, I know
nothing about plants and their names.

491
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,473
It's all the same,
it blooms and it smells.

492
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,073
How old are you?

493
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,959
I've told you already: twenty.

494
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:14,673
Twenty.

495
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,598
Twenty years old.

496
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,476
It's so odd to be twenty...

497
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,069
What's odd about that?

498
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,839
Everybody's some years old.

499
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:37,679
Is it true they'll be repairing
embankments after the flood.

500
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,439
That's right, and I volunteered
for the job too.

501
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,998
But do you ever go there?
Is the water really rising?

502
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,590
- Are we in danger of flood?
- Water's moods are unpredictable.

503
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:53,757
And I... don't go there because
there's no one I could go with.

504
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,629
How come? How come there's no one?

505
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:00,472
Unless you would like to go
for a walk with me.

506
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,230
Me.

507
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,718
All right. Tomorrow.

508
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,360
All right then. All right.

509
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,151
- Are you free at midday? At 12?
- Yes, I do.

510
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,995
Let's meet under the bridge,
at the river. We'll try to swim.

511
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:31,915
All right.

512
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,713
Careful!

513
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,633
But be careful!

514
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,034
Madam.

515
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:25,432
Madam, some boy on a bicycle
is here to see you.

516
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:28,798
- Tell him to wait. I'll be right there.
- I will.

517
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,114
Good morning.

518
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,311
Good morning. From Waterworks.

519
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,279
Dear Madam,

520
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:50,634
I was so embarrassed yesterday that
I arranged to see you in the afternoon,

521
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:54,116
but I'm working at that time.
I'll be free only around 4 o'clock.

522
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:57,551
Can you be at that hour on the beach,
in the place we agreed on?

523
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,671
With true respect.
Boguslaw K.

524
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,911
Who wrote that for him?

525
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,035
All right, tell him I'll be there.
Thank you.

526
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:55,034
Madam.

527
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,189
Madam.

528
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,119
Madam.

529
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:26,068
I'm sorry I'm late.
But I had to see Halinka off.

530
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,633
So she hasn't left?

531
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,911
She didn't have money for the ticket.

532
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:35,758
I had to give her everything
I had and now I'm penniless.

533
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,392
I'll give you some money.

534
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,673
Really?

535
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:44,999
Let's go.

536
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,792
We have to pick some sweet rush.
It's Pentecost tomorrow,

537
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,676
- the house needs to be adorned.
- What for? Why are houses adorned?

538
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:00,038
It's the end of spring,

539
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:02,874
the festival of summer,
the beginning of life.

540
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,756
Everything awakens,
releases a scent.

541
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,113
Can't you smell it?

542
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:13,669
How it's all breathing heavily,
steaming?

543
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:20,912
It's the festival of life.

544
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:52,279
- What are you thinking about?
- Nothing.

545
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,559
About Halina?

546
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:57,673
About Halina.

547
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,233
Your back's all covered in sand.
I'll brush it off.

548
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,232
I'll wash it away in a moment.

549
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,198
What are you doing, Madam?

550
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,038
What are you doing?

551
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,198
You are so good.

552
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,553
Never say to any woman that she's good.

553
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,268
- What should I say, then?
- Nothing.

554
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,557
We need to get that weed.

555
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:33,670
- Here, take this. I'll get some more.
- No, that's enough.

556
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:39,988
No, it's not. If I don't get more
you'll complain I'm lazy...

557
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:46,550
Just a moment. Let me get
some more of that crap.

558
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:48,355
Come on.

559
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:50,759
What? What's wrong with him?

560
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,478
Why is he diving?

561
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:44,474
Marcin, what's the matter?
What's going on?

562
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,439
Swim over here, gentlemen.

563
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,913
Is something wrong?

564
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:56,709
Madam!

565
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,639
Is something wrong?

566
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:04,836
We're sending a car to the other side.
Wait there, please.

567
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:09,439
Madam!

568
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:14,838
- There's a coat right next to you.
- Thank you.

569
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:28,276
- Are you really You?
- Yes, it's me.

570
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,038
Will I get an autograph?

571
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,795
You're making a film somewhere
round here?

572
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:34,669
And what's it about?

573
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:47,151
<i>Since 12th June we knew he was ill. He'd
just had his second round of chemo.</i>

574
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,078
<i>He was doing quite well.</i>

575
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:52,191
<i>I woke up at night. He was awake.</i>

576
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:55,358
<i>Krysia, why don't we go
to Italy after all,</i>

577
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:58,238
<i>you haven't had a holiday.</i>

578
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:01,598
<i>And then I realized he didn't
want me to make that film.</i>

579
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:03,950
<i>That he wanted to be
with me all the time.</i>

580
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:07,958
<i>I started crying.</i>

581
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:13,194
<i>He just looked at me and said:
Andrzej will wait for you, don't worry.</i>

582
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:18,357
<i>I can't think about "Sweet rush"
without thinking of him.</i>

583
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:24,077
<i>Death is hovering over that text.
Also because he's gone.</i>

584
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:38,033
And? She's not there?

585
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,633
I love him.

586
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,953
He was my love for life and to the death

587
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:04,993
from the moment I understood
who he was

588
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:07,873
and what he was like.

589
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:13,230
It was always good between us.

590
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:21,358
We knew that we had each other,
he had me, and I had him.

591
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:23,755
Whatever happened, whatever came up.

592
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:40,398
I honestly don't know how
I was able to play that day.

593
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:47,193
He knew that after a long break
I get very insecure about acting.

594
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,356
That all the tickets were sold out.

595
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:55,558
He died in time for me
to make it for the performance.

596
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,908
Like he always did during
our whole life together.

597
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:12,278
I couldn't sleep at night
from Friday to Saturday.

598
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:14,590
I was sitting by his bed.
Crying.

599
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:18,190
He woke up about 2am. He said:
You're not sleeping? You're here.

600
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,994
Edward, tell me what I should do?

601
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:26,711
What to do?
Shall I take you to hospital again?

602
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,554
He said:
No, it's ok. I want to be at home.

603
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:37,598
And then, suddenly,

604
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:44,112
he said:
Can I say goodbye and go now?

605
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:53,872
I took it for a joke.

606
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:59,156
I always acted like this.

607
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:03,957
When I wanted something to disappear,
I'd pretend it wasn't there. Dismiss it.

608
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:11,835
On Saturday I was sitting beside him,

609
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,350
happy that everyone had left.

610
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:19,677
Between one spoonful and another.
He opened his eyes,

611
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,359
unseeing.

612
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:28,150
Then he sighed...

613
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,392
...as if relieved.

614
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,072
He closed his eyes.

615
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,436
Kasia, his sister, said to me:

616
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:50,910
Krysia, tell me, is he dead?

617
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:58,077
I answered - I don't know.

618
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:01,874
I don't know.

619
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,318
Totally confused.

620
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:14,030
I kissed him and on his lips

621
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:19,469
I felt that he was getting cold.

622
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:28,474
How could I even play that night?

623
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:35,951
I just can't understand that.

624
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:08,756
Help!

625
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:12,913
<i>Bogus, Bogus!</i>

626
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:15,834
He's drowning over there! There...

627
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:30,632
- He's not here.
- Come over here! Come!

628
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:35,668
<i>Bogus!</i>

629
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:47,274
- Have you found him?
- No. To the right...

630
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,357
<i>- Is he there?
- More to the right...</i>

631
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:10,477
More to the right...

632

<i>- Have you got him?
- No. To the right...</i>

633
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:17,199
In the middle...

634
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:24,033
He's here! Come over here!
Have you got him? <i>Bogus!</i>

635
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:27,877
Take him by the hand. <i>Bogus!</i>
Hurry up, hurry up, to the shore!

636
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,193
<i>Pull him!</i>

637
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,792
Take him by the hands.

638
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:12,995
<i>Bogus! Bogus!</i> Get up!

639
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:16,676
Up with him, up, up!
Get up!

640
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:19,232
Get up! Get up!

641
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:23,039
- <i>Bogus!</i> Bogus get up!
- Up with him! <i>Bogus!</i> Get up!

642
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:42,153
I'll go and get the fellows,
we need to swing him.

643
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:44,832
Wait, me too.
