{2707}{2754}Doctor von Braun confirmed...
{2755}{2823}that there has still been|no actual sighting|of the Soviet satellite,

{109437}{109538}See, Mr. Turner, that rocket|fell for about 14 seconds,|which means...
{109540}{109604}that it flew to an altitude|of 3,000 feet...

{109669}{109750}"S" equals one-half"A"|"T" squared...
{109752}{109838}where "S'is the altitude,|A'is the gravity constant...|or 32...

{130758}{130839}Tom Webster of Virginia State|College. I wanna talk to you|about a scholarship.
{130841}{130940}Jack Palmer, Virginia Tech.|We got the best science program|in the state, buddy, okay?
{130942}{131037}Congratulations, son.|Good luck to you.
{131101}{131164}What did he say to you?|What did who say?
{131166}{131303}Von Braun.|That was Wernher von Braun.|You just shook his hand.
{131489}{131562}[Cheering]
{131715}{131792}Oh, Homer,|I'm so proud of you.|Thanks, Mom.
{131794}{131874}He's not here, hon.
{131875}{131934}Where's Miss Riley?
{132331}{132378}Hello, Miss Riley.
{132450}{132496}Hi, Homer.
{132498}{132544}Hi.|Hi.
{132607}{132680}Oh!|You did it!
{132682}{132756}I knew you would.
{132758}{132852}The Rocket Boys|are goin' to college.
{132854}{132918}We all got scholarships.|[Chuckling]
{132920}{132978}And you know what?
{133014}{133103}From now on,|every school year,
{133105}{133163}I'm gonna brag|to all my new students...
{133165}{133252}about how I taught|Homer Hickam|and the Rocket Boys.
{133254}{133315}Maybe one day,
{133317}{133418}one of them'll feel|like they can do|what y'all did.
{133697}{133767}You know, just,|stuff like that|takes time.
{133902}{133948}Will you let me out?
{134112}{134226}[John]|What are they doin;|charging Olga for that.
{134228}{134291}Hell, I'm going to salvage|something up here?
{134293}{134341}Hey, Dad. Hi.|Hello, Homer.
{134343}{134430}I just wanted to tell you|how much I appreciate|what you did for me.
{134432}{134528}I know it wasn't easy for you,|so thank you.
{134530}{134594}A-And we're shootin' off|our last rocket today at 5:00,
{134596}{134681}so if you'd like to come|see it...|I got a lot of work to do.
{134683}{134762}All right. Well,|I just thought I'd ask.
{134828}{134886}Hear you met|your big hero.
{134942}{134994}Didn't even know it.
{135156}{135202}Look,
{135204}{135274}I know you and me|don't exactly see eye to eye|on certain things.
{135276}{135386}I mean,|we don't see eye to eye|on just about anything.
{135388}{135501}But Dad, I come to believe|that I got it in me to be|somebody in this world.
{135503}{135570}A-And it's not because|I'm so different|from you either.
{135572}{135630}It's 'cause|I'm the same.
{135631}{135744}You know, I can be|just as hardheaded|and just as tough.
{135746}{135847}I only hope I can be|as good a man as you are.
{135849}{135922}I mean, sure,
{135924}{136009}Dr. Von Braun's|a great scientist,
{136011}{136069}but he isn't my hero.
{136795}{136842}[Elevator Buzzes]
{137547}{137654}It's our last rocket.|Yeah, let's do it.
{137656}{137726}Wire it up for me, will ya?|I gotta do something.|Yeah.
{137774}{137825}Hi, Homer.|Hi.
{137827}{137895}Congratulations|on winning|the science fair.
{137897}{137975}It's gotta be the most|exciting thing that's ever|happened around here.
{137977}{138054}Um, I was thinking,|Homer, if, if you've|got some time...
{138056}{138146}Excuse me, Dorothy.|Hi.|Hi.
{138241}{138328}Good luck.|Thanks.|[Clears Throat]
{138330}{138389}Hey, everybody, can we have|your attention, please?
{138391}{138439}Come on, Homer,|let her fly!
{138441}{138528}We're gonna launch the rocket|in a minute, but we'd like|to say thank you first.
{138530}{138635}If it wasn't for y'all,|we'd never have gotten|into any science fair.
{138637}{138706}We'd probably never have|gotten past blowin' up|my mom's fence.
{138707}{138764}[Laughing]|But we did...
{138766}{138851}because of your help|and support.
{138853}{138911}And this is for Coalwood.
{139031}{139122}There are a few people|who believed in us|even before we did.
{139123}{139210}We'd like to dedicate|this rocket to them.
{139211}{139272}To Ike Bykovsky.
{139343}{139415}To Mr. Bolden,|who helped us so much.
{139478}{139549}To the person|who first inspired us,
{139551}{139610}our teacher, Miss Riley.
{139660}{139786}And, finally, I'd like|to dedicate this rocket|to my mom and to...
{139909}{139955}my dad.
{140310}{140407}You know, it, uh, won't fly|unless somebody pushes|the button.
{140485}{140536}It's yours,|if you want it.
{141091}{141167}Ten, nine...|[Together]|Eight,
{141169}{141231}seven, six, five,
{141233}{141322}four, three, two, one.
