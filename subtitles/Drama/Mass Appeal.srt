1
00:01:09,024 --> 00:01:13,529
Before we start, I want
you to know something.

2
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,283
I'm not a rat.

3
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:18,468
You understand?

4
00:01:18,613 --> 00:01:21,484
I want that on record before we start.

5
00:01:21,684 --> 00:01:22,734
Okay.

6
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:24,240
You are not a rat.

7
00:01:24,322 --> 00:01:26,496
And it's on record.

8
00:01:27,035 --> 00:01:29,712
Mr. weeks, the charges against you...

9
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:33,097
Racketeering, extortion, kidnapping,

10
00:01:33,132 --> 00:01:36,066
and accomplice to
murder... are very serious.

11
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,890
Am I correct in stating
that you are here today

12
00:01:38,925 --> 00:01:41,747
to make a deal with the federal government?

13
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:43,560
Correct.

14
00:01:43,592 --> 00:01:44,825
And am I correct in stating

15
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,940
that you are going from trusted confidant

16
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:52,147
to one of south Boston's most
notorious and violent gangsters

17
00:01:52,235 --> 00:01:54,571
to government witness?

18
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,206
Correct.

19
00:01:56,643 --> 00:01:59,936
Then I need to know everything you know

20
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:02,112
about the winter hill gang,

21
00:02:02,282 --> 00:02:04,559
the FBI and John connolly,

22
00:02:04,684 --> 00:02:08,952
and specifically, what you
know about your former boss

23
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:12,677
and now fugitive, James "whitey" bulger.

24
00:02:15,154 --> 00:02:16,612
Well, let's start.

25
00:02:16,749 --> 00:02:22,905
♪ I have not come, yeah ♪

26
00:02:26,482 --> 00:02:30,138
- _
- ♪ to testify ♪

27
00:02:30,173 --> 00:02:32,591
Yeah. It'll be a good time tonight.

28
00:02:32,626 --> 00:02:33,267
We got to do it.

29
00:02:33,302 --> 00:02:35,324
Sorry, buddy. I can't let you in.

30
00:02:35,359 --> 00:02:37,227
That's cool, man. I'm friends with Jimmy.

31
00:02:37,262 --> 00:02:38,247
- Really?
- Yeah.

32
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:39,549
- You're with Jimmy?
- Yeah.

33
00:02:39,581 --> 00:02:42,577
Well, I still can't let you in.

34
00:02:42,612 --> 00:02:43,910
Who the fuck are you?

35
00:02:43,945 --> 00:02:46,356
I'm the guy who works here.

36
00:02:46,388 --> 00:02:47,628
You probably don't remember this,

37
00:02:47,663 --> 00:02:50,048
but you were here last Saturday night

38
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:50,933
with a few of your friends

39
00:02:50,968 --> 00:02:52,032
around 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.

40
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:54,197
You took a piss up against the bar.

41
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:56,738
And that's frowned upon here.

42
00:02:56,773 --> 00:03:00,643
But if you go down to brannigan's

43
00:03:00,678 --> 00:03:01,370
just right down there,

44
00:03:01,405 --> 00:03:04,563
they'll let you take a shit
in the middle of the floor

45
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:06,087
if that's what you want to do.

46
00:03:06,122 --> 00:03:08,367
But you can't... you can't do it here.

47
00:03:08,402 --> 00:03:09,637
All right. Yeah.

48
00:03:09,672 --> 00:03:10,399
Okay?

49
00:03:10,434 --> 00:03:13,118
Oh, yeah, we'll go. Hey, look.

50
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,104
No hard feelings, okay?

51
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:18,768
Get the fuck out of my fucking
way, you fuckin' retard!

52
00:03:21,772 --> 00:03:23,614
Tough guy wants to dance?

53
00:03:23,694 --> 00:03:26,355
Come on! Step the fuck up!

54
00:03:26,429 --> 00:03:27,342
She's all fired up.

55
00:03:27,377 --> 00:03:29,566
She knows he's over at the bulldog,

56
00:03:29,601 --> 00:03:31,566
running his mouth again.

57
00:03:31,734 --> 00:03:34,465
She go over there and she got
a little fork in her pocket,

58
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,672
you know?

59
00:03:35,704 --> 00:03:37,139
She walk right in there,

60
00:03:37,173 --> 00:03:39,741
tap him on the shoulder,
take his fuckin' eye out

61
00:03:39,776 --> 00:03:41,581
right there in front of everybody.

62
00:03:41,616 --> 00:03:43,548
And Connors was fuckin' in there.

63
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,669
He couldn't even look. He had to look away.

64
00:03:45,704 --> 00:03:49,231
Connors ain't no tough guy.
Denucci whipped his ass in 59.

65
00:03:49,266 --> 00:03:51,697
Of course he did. He's
a professional fighter.

66
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:52,742
Yeah, so's Connors.

67
00:03:52,777 --> 00:03:53,859
Connors is a tough kid,

68
00:03:53,894 --> 00:03:57,320
but Joe denucci's the real
thing, it's all I'm saying.

69
00:03:57,355 --> 00:03:58,694
Well, I'm saying that Connors

70
00:03:58,727 --> 00:04:00,541
didn't want no part of this broad.

71
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,279
Hey, you know something?

72
00:04:02,314 --> 00:04:03,852
What?

73
00:04:05,337 --> 00:04:10,324
For 15 straight minutes,
i been watching you

74
00:04:10,372 --> 00:04:13,454
putting your big fat fuckin' fingers

75
00:04:13,526 --> 00:04:15,453
into your disgusting mouth

76
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:19,366
which is filled with god knows
what kind of fuckin' bacteria,

77
00:04:19,435 --> 00:04:24,325
and then you take the same
big fat fuckin' filthy fingers

78
00:04:24,436 --> 00:04:26,355
and you stuff 'em back into the bowl

79
00:04:26,388 --> 00:04:29,424
that is there for public consumption.

80
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:32,615
Now, what the fuck are you thinkin', John?

81
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,715
Well, I wasn't thinking, Jimmy.

82
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,309
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,388
Just don't do it again.

84
00:04:38,657 --> 00:04:40,165
Jimmy.

85
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,080
Sorry to bother you.

86
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:44,116
We got trouble outside.

87
00:04:48,991 --> 00:04:49,841
Fuck!

88
00:04:49,906 --> 00:04:51,352
Ronald, hold him up straight!

89
00:04:51,387 --> 00:04:52,722
Put him up against the car!

90
00:04:53,867 --> 00:04:55,619
- Get him up!
- Come on!

91
00:04:55,652 --> 00:04:57,377
Get him up! Get him up!

92
00:04:57,955 --> 00:05:00,461
- Get up here!
- Get him up!

93
00:05:02,087 --> 00:05:03,523
Put a stop to it.

94
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:05,183
Charlie!

95
00:05:05,218 --> 00:05:07,187
He's a fucking kid, Charlie. Come on.

96
00:05:07,423 --> 00:05:10,266
- Fuck! He's fucking dead!
- Charlie. Come here.

97
00:05:10,299 --> 00:05:11,557
- What the fuck, Jimmy?
- Shut up.

98
00:05:11,592 --> 00:05:13,290
You're fuckin' dead, you...

99
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:15,009
Did I fuckin' tell you to shut up?

100
00:05:15,044 --> 00:05:16,997
You listen to me. I won't say it twice.

101
00:05:17,059 --> 00:05:18,967
- Get in the fuckin' bar.
- Come on, pretty boy.

102
00:05:19,002 --> 00:05:20,395
Asshole!

103
00:05:20,456 --> 00:05:21,823
Phew.

104
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:27,438
Hey, you know Charlie, the
guy you were just beatin' on?

105
00:05:27,517 --> 00:05:28,312
Yeah.

106
00:05:28,347 --> 00:05:31,170
Yeah, he's Charlie mctiernan.

107
00:05:31,343 --> 00:05:33,455
He's married to one of Jimmy's cousins.

108
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,533
How the fuck am I supposed to know that?

109
00:05:40,615 --> 00:05:41,897
I don't know.

110
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:45,908
Good luck, kid.

111
00:06:15,857 --> 00:06:17,793
Get in the fuckin' car.

112
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:22,460
No, no, no, no. You drive.

113
00:06:55,187 --> 00:06:57,373
Are we meetin' Carmelo out here?

114
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:00,081
What the fuck, Jimmy?
What are we doin' here?

115
00:07:00,126 --> 00:07:02,037
- I mean...
- Kill the engine.

116
00:07:02,134 --> 00:07:03,838
Jimmy, look, I'm... I'm sorry.

117
00:07:03,873 --> 00:07:06,405
- I was doing my job.
- Shut the fuck up.

118
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:30,397
Right, that's enough.

119
00:07:32,549 --> 00:07:34,664
You got something I like, kid.

120
00:07:35,851 --> 00:07:37,747
It's Kevin, right?

121
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:40,262
Meet Joey anguilo.

122
00:07:46,522 --> 00:07:49,881
And just fucking like
that, I was winter hill.

123
00:07:50,192 --> 00:07:52,767
And it was a big deal to me.

124
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,342
What'd you do?

125
00:07:55,685 --> 00:07:57,205
The everyday, small-time stuff...

126
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,219
The rackets, driving around making pickups,

127
00:07:59,254 --> 00:08:02,239
checking on our vending machines, you know.

128
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:04,419
And listenin' to Mickey bullshit.

129
00:08:04,499 --> 00:08:07,572
So, this guy at the libra
lounge in revere over there

130
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,185
is tellin' me that the
porn stars in California,

131
00:08:11,281 --> 00:08:12,558
they eat a lot of celery

132
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:14,215
before they're gonna perform, you know?

133
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,879
Wait. Whoa. Stop for a second.

134
00:08:15,914 --> 00:08:18,152
That's old Mrs. Cody.

135
00:08:18,225 --> 00:08:20,398
Mickey, you remember old Mrs. Cody?

136
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,561
Of course I do.

137
00:08:21,596 --> 00:08:23,906
Going strong. Look at her.

138
00:08:26,936 --> 00:08:28,409
Pardon me, Mrs. Cody,

139
00:08:28,444 --> 00:08:30,617
but I think I smell a little Shepherd's pie

140
00:08:30,652 --> 00:08:32,172
sneaking out of that bag there.

141
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:32,891
Am I right?

142
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:34,903
As I live and breathe, it's Jimmy!

143
00:08:34,936 --> 00:08:38,402
- It is.
- When did you get out of Alcatraz?

144
00:08:38,437 --> 00:08:42,378
Oh. Uh... that's nearly 10
years ago now, Mrs. Cody.

145
00:08:42,412 --> 00:08:43,890
- Oh.
- More than a minute.

146
00:08:43,925 --> 00:08:45,146
Well, it's wonderful

147
00:08:45,181 --> 00:08:47,636
to have you back in the neighborhood, son.

148
00:08:47,702 --> 00:08:49,286
You remember Mickey, don't you?

149
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:50,126
- Hello, there.
- Hi, Mickey.

150
00:08:50,161 --> 00:08:52,427
How are you, sweetheart?
It's nice to see you.

151
00:08:52,462 --> 00:08:53,750
You know this kid, Kevin?

152
00:08:53,785 --> 00:08:54,957
Your paper boy, right?

153
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,769
I grew up a little bit, huh?

154
00:08:56,804 --> 00:08:58,985
Make sure everything gets put away nice.

155
00:08:59,062 --> 00:09:01,214
She got everything she needs, huh?

156
00:09:01,289 --> 00:09:02,732
The truth of the matter is,

157
00:09:02,764 --> 00:09:05,761
a lot of people in southie loved Jimmy.

158
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:08,163
And you'd include John
connolly in that group?

159
00:09:08,226 --> 00:09:10,340
Well, especially John connolly.

160
00:09:10,373 --> 00:09:12,285
I mean, he grew up in the projects

161
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,709
a few doors down from the bulger brothers.

162
00:09:14,744 --> 00:09:16,150
He was tight with Billy,

163
00:09:16,185 --> 00:09:17,774
but like every other
kid in the neighborhood,

164
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:20,441
he was in awe of Jimmy.

165
00:09:20,522 --> 00:09:22,301
The story goes, when he was growing up,

166
00:09:22,336 --> 00:09:24,726
connolly was taking a
beating from some guys,

167
00:09:24,761 --> 00:09:27,455
and Jimmy stepped in and
saved his ass, I guess.

168
00:09:27,523 --> 00:09:28,667
We've now come home

169
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,712
to focus on this office's top priority,

170
00:09:30,765 --> 00:09:32,707
which is really the north
end of the Italian mafia,

171
00:09:32,742 --> 00:09:34,206
led by gennaro angiulo.

172
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,202
He's a hell of a cop,
he's a straight shooter,

173
00:09:36,237 --> 00:09:38,540
and, well, we're damn lucky to have him.

174
00:09:38,575 --> 00:09:39,669
Welcome, John.

175
00:09:42,694 --> 00:09:45,398
You know, southie kids...

176
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:47,363
We went straight from
playing cops and robbers

177
00:09:47,398 --> 00:09:50,501
on the playground to doing
it for real in the streets.

178
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,235
And just like on the playground,

179
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,820
it wasn't always easy to tell who's who.

180
00:09:55,152 --> 00:09:57,050
There he is.

181
00:09:57,085 --> 00:09:58,941
Oh, John!

182
00:09:59,338 --> 00:10:00,370
How are you?

183
00:10:00,405 --> 00:10:01,547
Yeah, good.

184
00:10:01,627 --> 00:10:03,068
If I'm buying anyone,

185
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,713
- I'm buying Gary Carter.
- Gary Carter.

186
00:10:04,748 --> 00:10:07,178
That kid is a star in the making.

187
00:10:07,327 --> 00:10:08,455
Which is why it'll never happen.

188
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,647
Not in a million fuckin'
years. You know why?

189
00:10:10,682 --> 00:10:13,258
Because it's the sox.

190
00:10:14,722 --> 00:10:16,858
So, seriously, what do I call you now?

191
00:10:16,893 --> 00:10:18,827
I mean, is it Billy?

192
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:20,930
Or I got to call you senator?

193
00:10:20,993 --> 00:10:23,342
Oh, come on. I'm the one drooling here.

194
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,011
Mr. FBI hero.

195
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:27,422
How's the wife? How's marianne?

196
00:10:27,457 --> 00:10:29,269
Great. Can't complain.

197
00:10:29,335 --> 00:10:32,751
Well, look at you. Look at you.

198
00:10:33,846 --> 00:10:36,003
I haven't forgotten where we came from.

199
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:37,610
"Don't you ever do that again.

200
00:10:37,645 --> 00:10:39,513
I want to see you throw the first punch,

201
00:10:39,613 --> 00:10:41,001
and throw the first two punches."

202
00:10:42,983 --> 00:10:46,005
Oh, man. Yeah, I got to
get down to the old harbor.

203
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,443
You ought to, John.

204
00:10:47,478 --> 00:10:49,487
Your ma would love to see you.

205
00:10:49,634 --> 00:10:51,938
How's, uh... how's your brother?

206
00:10:51,973 --> 00:10:53,069
How is Jimmy?

207
00:10:53,104 --> 00:10:54,661
Jimmy's Jimmy.

208
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:55,720
You know?

209
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:56,679
Why do you ask?

210
00:10:56,714 --> 00:10:57,941
Well, it's no secret

211
00:10:57,976 --> 00:11:00,610
that southie's been a war zone lately.

212
00:11:00,655 --> 00:11:03,787
What, with 60, 70 slayings?

213
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:06,505
But your brother and his winter hill boys,

214
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,696
they're still out there.

215
00:11:07,731 --> 00:11:10,679
They must be doing something right. Right?

216
00:11:12,894 --> 00:11:15,261
All right, John. Let's
call this what it is.

217
00:11:15,296 --> 00:11:16,901
You're jerking me off under the table

218
00:11:16,975 --> 00:11:18,038
- to get to Jimmy.
- I'm not.

219
00:11:18,092 --> 00:11:19,688
Jimmy's business is Jimmy's business.

220
00:11:19,723 --> 00:11:21,992
It sure as hell ain't none of mine.

221
00:11:22,712 --> 00:11:26,269
I got an edict to eradicate the mafia.

222
00:11:26,423 --> 00:11:29,132
And I know that Jimmy and Stephen flemmi

223
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:31,131
are musclin' in on their numbers rackets

224
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:33,619
and their vending machines.

225
00:11:33,703 --> 00:11:36,608
And I know that this ain't
sitting very well with angiulo.

226
00:11:36,643 --> 00:11:37,437
I don't want to hear this.

227
00:11:37,472 --> 00:11:39,541
You need to hear this, Billy.

228
00:11:40,254 --> 00:11:42,035
Your brother...

229
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,202
Is wading in some very dark waters.

230
00:11:49,732 --> 00:11:53,601
You know... we all need friends.

231
00:11:54,452 --> 00:11:56,672
Even Jimmy.

232
00:11:56,831 --> 00:11:58,431
Even you.

233
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,099
Nobody gets there on their own.

234
00:12:01,134 --> 00:12:03,057
Ain't that right, senator?

235
00:12:04,413 --> 00:12:05,980
You know what, John?

236
00:12:06,236 --> 00:12:08,153
It's good to see you doing so well.

237
00:12:08,284 --> 00:12:09,582
Really, it is.

238
00:12:09,617 --> 00:12:11,914
Give my regards to the boys at the Plaza.

239
00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:13,771
Listen, you don't want to
give that to Jimmy, fine.

240
00:12:13,806 --> 00:12:20,496
But just tell him i
said... hello, and I'm back.

241
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,992
Oh, if Jimmy wants to get in touch,

242
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:24,535
he'll find you. Trust me.

243
00:12:24,607 --> 00:12:26,935
You ought to come over to dinner sometime.

244
00:12:27,063 --> 00:12:29,399
Mary and the kids would love to see you.

245
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,251
Robert, how are things?

246
00:12:32,286 --> 00:12:32,851
How are you, senator?

247
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:34,454
Good to see you.

248
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:45,732
Oh, there she is.

249
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:48,121
Agent marianne.

250
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,268
Hands where I can see 'em.

251
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,633
Looks good. You're making progress.

252
00:12:53,668 --> 00:12:55,662
Well, thank you, agent connolly.

253
00:12:55,697 --> 00:12:56,987
Did you save Boston yet?

254
00:12:58,405 --> 00:13:00,417
It's early, but I'm working on it.

255
00:13:00,452 --> 00:13:02,869
You better work hard, because
hoover's expecting big things

256
00:13:02,937 --> 00:13:05,039
from his favorite son.

257
00:13:06,146 --> 00:13:07,404
He won't be disappointed.

258
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:08,341
Oh, is that so?

259
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:24,826
Hey, little thief.

260
00:13:25,386 --> 00:13:27,622
What are you doing? I know what you want.

261
00:13:27,657 --> 00:13:31,061
- Jimmy? Is that you?
- What you looking for?

262
00:13:31,187 --> 00:13:32,666
Good morning, ma.

263
00:13:33,498 --> 00:13:35,157
How was work?

264
00:13:35,244 --> 00:13:38,019
It was long. I got to get
some sleep, sweetheart.

265
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:39,480
How we doin', huh?

266
00:13:39,515 --> 00:13:41,580
All right, hey.

267
00:13:41,707 --> 00:13:44,454
You still owe me $56.

268
00:13:44,489 --> 00:13:46,177
What do you say? Hmm?

269
00:13:46,212 --> 00:13:48,022
All right, one hand, huh?

270
00:13:48,057 --> 00:13:49,338
- One hand.
- Ah, yeah, yeah.

271
00:13:49,373 --> 00:13:52,267
And $56 is still a lot of money, Jimmy.

272
00:13:52,302 --> 00:13:53,816
Oh, don't I know it.

273
00:13:53,851 --> 00:13:55,706
You gonna cheat me again
or you gonna play straight?

274
00:13:55,741 --> 00:13:59,035
Ah, look who's talkin'. Cheat.

275
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:02,255
Ah, Jimmy... get the jacket off.

276
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:03,387
Here we go.

277
00:14:21,243 --> 00:14:22,532
Gin.

278
00:14:22,606 --> 00:14:24,898
Come on! Not again.

279
00:14:25,093 --> 00:14:27,753
You're not paying attention.

280
00:14:27,864 --> 00:14:29,857
Can't you see I'm after hearts?

281
00:14:29,892 --> 00:14:32,835
And you just keep feeding me hearts!

282
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,314
Billy, I'm getting creamed over here.

283
00:14:34,349 --> 00:14:35,079
Better you than me, pal.

284
00:14:35,114 --> 00:14:37,056
Did you learn nothing in prison?

285
00:14:37,124 --> 00:14:40,767
Oh, all those hours and no
one taught you how to play gin.

286
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,970
Well, they didn't teach me
how to cheat against my mom.

287
00:14:44,038 --> 00:14:46,495
Look, here's my cards. Count 'em out.

288
00:14:46,575 --> 00:14:50,405
Hey, ma, did you know old mother
Burke died over on Baker street?

289
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,347
No one found her for a couple of weeks.

290
00:14:52,382 --> 00:14:53,782
That's right.

291
00:14:53,816 --> 00:14:55,817
And when they broke down the door,

292
00:14:55,869 --> 00:14:59,010
her cats had devoured the best part of her.

293
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,877
That's... that's beautiful, ma.

294
00:15:02,912 --> 00:15:03,891
Who's hungry?

295
00:15:03,926 --> 00:15:06,665
I'm out. I got creamed,
I'm going to take a nap.

296
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,040
Thanks for cheating, ma.

297
00:15:08,094 --> 00:15:09,896
See you later.

298
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:13,469
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Yeah?

299
00:15:13,504 --> 00:15:16,106
Do you remember little John connolly?

300
00:15:16,141 --> 00:15:17,185
Yeah, why? What's up?

301
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,557
He's an FBI agent now. He's come back home.

302
00:15:23,749 --> 00:15:25,846
_

303
00:15:28,355 --> 00:15:30,057
_

304
00:15:30,234 --> 00:15:31,610
_

305
00:15:36,661 --> 00:15:37,605
_

306
00:15:44,098 --> 00:15:45,546
connolly.

307
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:50,434
I'm on my way.

308
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:32,483
Hey, Jimmy. It's good to see you.

309
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:36,293
The fuckin' FBI, John?

310
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,423
You got two minutes.

311
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,163
All right, I'm gonna cut right to it.

312
00:16:45,974 --> 00:16:48,362
I... I have it on very good authority

313
00:16:48,397 --> 00:16:52,919
that gennaro angiulo is
planning to have you murdered.

314
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:54,911
Is that so?

315
00:16:55,725 --> 00:16:58,238
And how does he plan to achieve that?

316
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:02,374
That's the kind of
information that my side gets.

317
00:17:02,512 --> 00:17:05,733
And that's the kind of
information that we can provide.

318
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,695
John, do you know what I do to rats?

319
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,133
It ain't rattin', Jimmy.

320
00:17:10,186 --> 00:17:11,553
It's an alliance.

321
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,617
An alliance between me and the fuckin' FBI?

322
00:17:14,652 --> 00:17:17,756
No, no, between you and me.

323
00:17:19,195 --> 00:17:22,881
I can help you, Jimmy, and you can help me.

324
00:17:23,164 --> 00:17:26,494
Listen, the whole fucking game has changed.

325
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,016
And I'm not trying to clean up southie.

326
00:17:29,097 --> 00:17:32,703
Fuck that! I fuckin' love this place.

327
00:17:32,829 --> 00:17:35,050
I'm interested in the north end

328
00:17:35,085 --> 00:17:37,823
and taking down the fuckin' wops.

329
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:41,302
I'm interested in the mafia,
and I bet you are, too.

330
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,634
That's two minutes.

331
00:17:48,689 --> 00:17:50,759
Just think about it, will you?

332
00:18:30,356 --> 00:18:31,412
Hi.

333
00:18:33,968 --> 00:18:37,918
Here she is, miss America.

334
00:18:41,135 --> 00:18:43,409
And don't we look beautiful today.

335
00:18:48,122 --> 00:18:50,039
Where's my boy, sleeping upstairs?

336
00:18:50,074 --> 00:18:50,659
Yeah.

337
00:18:50,694 --> 00:18:52,676
- Should I wake him up?
- No.

338
00:18:52,744 --> 00:18:54,239
- You don't want me to wake him up?
- No!

339
00:18:54,274 --> 00:18:55,905
You sore at me?

340
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,917
Jimmy, don't wake him up.

341
00:18:56,952 --> 00:18:59,585
I'll be sore if you wake him up.

342
00:18:59,653 --> 00:19:01,100
I'm gonna go wake him up now.

343
00:19:01,171 --> 00:19:03,357
- Don't wake him up.
- Wakin' him up.

344
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:27,263
Hey, buddy. Got a question for you.

345
00:19:28,775 --> 00:19:32,496
What are you gonna do
with the rest of that?

346
00:19:32,569 --> 00:19:33,929
Not drink it.

347
00:19:33,969 --> 00:19:36,658
No, buddy, you got to
drink every drop of that.

348
00:19:36,693 --> 00:19:38,210
You know why?

349
00:19:38,276 --> 00:19:41,024
That is pure vitamin c,

350
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:43,716
and it's freshly squeezed by your mommy,

351
00:19:43,757 --> 00:19:48,374
which is, obviously, makes it
more special, even magical-like.

352
00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:52,075
It's true. Go on. Put it away.

353
00:19:53,454 --> 00:19:55,011
Good boy.

354
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,622
So...

355
00:20:00,196 --> 00:20:02,318
Do you feel like, maybe,
you want to tell me

356
00:20:02,353 --> 00:20:04,640
what happened in school yesterday?

357
00:20:12,518 --> 00:20:15,467
Oh, I remember. Something did happen.

358
00:20:15,533 --> 00:20:17,440
Yeah? What happened?

359
00:20:17,536 --> 00:20:21,279
Timmy. He's the kid who's
always trying to trip me.

360
00:20:21,372 --> 00:20:23,535
And he stole my coloring
pencils off my desk

361
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,303
when my back was turned.

362
00:20:25,369 --> 00:20:27,391
So I punched him in the face.

363
00:20:27,498 --> 00:20:28,588
Good boy.

364
00:20:28,623 --> 00:20:29,825
Jimmy.

365
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:31,154
Hey.

366
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,852
Let me ask you a question...

367
00:20:32,887 --> 00:20:34,612
Is that why you think you got in trouble?

368
00:20:34,647 --> 00:20:37,204
'Cause you punched him in the face?

369
00:20:38,184 --> 00:20:39,054
All right.

370
00:20:39,096 --> 00:20:41,248
I need you to listen very
carefully to what I'm sayin'

371
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:43,263
because there are lessons again and again

372
00:20:43,311 --> 00:20:45,424
throughout your whole life.

373
00:20:45,459 --> 00:20:48,261
You got to learn from these things, right?

374
00:20:48,326 --> 00:20:50,034
Here's the deal...

375
00:20:50,069 --> 00:20:52,836
You did not get in trouble

376
00:20:52,904 --> 00:20:55,382
because you punched this
sneaky brat in the face.

377
00:20:55,417 --> 00:20:56,681
Not at all.

378
00:20:56,716 --> 00:20:58,654
You got in trouble

379
00:20:58,752 --> 00:21:01,900
because you punched this
sneaky little brat in the face

380
00:21:01,935 --> 00:21:03,884
in front of other people.

381
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,849
Jimmy?

382
00:21:07,188 --> 00:21:08,763
I really don't think that
that's the right thing

383
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,699
to be teaching your kid.

384
00:21:10,855 --> 00:21:16,223
No, that's absolutely what i
should be tellin' him, babe.

385
00:21:16,283 --> 00:21:19,254
So, the lesson you got to learn is this...

386
00:21:19,892 --> 00:21:21,514
It's not what you do,

387
00:21:21,576 --> 00:21:23,139
it's when and where you do it,

388
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,093
and who you do it to or with.

389
00:21:27,198 --> 00:21:28,927
Huh? You follow?

390
00:21:28,981 --> 00:21:30,879
Yes, I follow.

391
00:21:30,976 --> 00:21:33,097
Punch people when no one's looking.

392
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:35,627
That's exactly right.

393
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:39,353
If nobody sees it,

394
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:41,277
it didn't happen.

395
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,052
Well, look what crawled out of the gutter.

396
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:05,447
Good afternoon, officer Flynn.

397
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:08,336
What happened? I must
have been doing 30 in a 25.

398
00:22:08,371 --> 00:22:10,108
Gonna lock me up for life or somethin'?

399
00:22:10,143 --> 00:22:11,456
Why don't you do your fucking job

400
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,154
instead of trying to jerk off on
us, you pathetic fuckin' stiff?

401
00:22:13,189 --> 00:22:16,985
- All right, Tommy. Tommy!
- I'm doing my fuckin' job.

402
00:22:17,032 --> 00:22:20,095
I'm sure the officer
didn't stop us by accident.

403
00:22:20,182 --> 00:22:21,997
You wouldn't happen to
be carrying a message,

404
00:22:22,067 --> 00:22:23,596
now, would you?

405
00:22:23,657 --> 00:22:28,819
In fact, I am. Gerry
angiulo sends his regards.

406
00:22:28,918 --> 00:22:30,910
Says he doesn't like finding
his boys beat to a pulp

407
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:33,171
and left for dead in empty parking lots.

408
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:33,953
He also said he's confident

409
00:22:33,988 --> 00:22:35,890
you ain't gonna cause him any more troubles

410
00:22:35,931 --> 00:22:39,091
'cause if you do, it's only gonna
cause much worse troubles for you.

411
00:22:39,145 --> 00:22:40,464
Listen, motherfucker.

412
00:22:40,499 --> 00:22:42,106
You think 'cause you're
wearing a fucking uniform,

413
00:22:42,141 --> 00:22:42,962
you can do what you want?

414
00:22:43,023 --> 00:22:44,953
- Go fuck yourself!
- Tommy!

415
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,628
- Fuck you!
- Tommy, close the fucking door.

416
00:22:47,994 --> 00:22:50,303
I got to tell you something, officer Flynn.

417
00:22:50,338 --> 00:22:53,324
It's a sad day when a native son

418
00:22:53,385 --> 00:22:55,291
takes up with his oppressor.

419
00:22:55,339 --> 00:22:58,286
There's a word for that
back home, you know.

420
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:00,144
Penalty's death.

421
00:23:00,304 --> 00:23:01,710
You threatenin' me, bulger?

422
00:23:01,745 --> 00:23:04,402
The last thing I would do
if I was planning to harm you

423
00:23:04,437 --> 00:23:06,949
is to warn you in advance, you dumb fuck.

424
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,587
You better watch yourself, bulger.

425
00:23:08,622 --> 00:23:10,252
You better fuck yourself, Flynn.

426
00:23:10,287 --> 00:23:13,924
Fuck you, you project rat.
And fuck you, you rummy.

427
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,310
_

428
00:23:26,061 --> 00:23:28,902
I never trusted Flynn.
He's a fucking prick.

429
00:23:29,048 --> 00:23:30,122
Take it easy, will you?

430
00:23:30,157 --> 00:23:32,624
Even as kids, he was a fuckin' prick!

431
00:23:32,659 --> 00:23:33,967
A fuckin' prick.

432
00:23:34,002 --> 00:23:35,473
Please, calm down.

433
00:23:35,593 --> 00:23:37,751
Swear to god, I'm gonna fuckin' kill him.

434
00:23:37,786 --> 00:23:39,145
I'll fucking kill that Flynn.

435
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,341
Take it easy, will you?

436
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,718
Cock-sucking, turncoat motherfucker.

437
00:23:43,753 --> 00:23:44,878
He's fucking dead!

438
00:23:44,949 --> 00:23:46,811
You're not fuckin' killing anybody, Tommy,

439
00:23:46,872 --> 00:23:49,225
and you ain't killing a cop any time.

440
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,462
You hear me?

441
00:23:53,888 --> 00:23:55,201
Fuck you, whitey.

442
00:23:55,236 --> 00:23:57,423
Oh, Jesus. Tommy...

443
00:23:57,458 --> 00:24:00,552
- Go fuck yourself.
- Come on. Enough.

444
00:24:00,612 --> 00:24:02,517
Huh?

445
00:24:02,696 --> 00:24:03,260
Fuck you.

446
00:24:03,295 --> 00:24:05,108
Take it easy. Take it easy, come on.

447
00:24:05,168 --> 00:24:07,104
You want to take a shot, Tommy?

448
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,043
- Enough.
- Take your shot.

449
00:24:09,096 --> 00:24:10,172
But make it your fucking best,

450
00:24:10,207 --> 00:24:11,795
'cause I get up, I eat you.

451
00:24:11,881 --> 00:24:13,722
- Sit down. Sit down.
- Let's go. Come on.

452
00:24:13,757 --> 00:24:15,294
Relax. Jimmy, he's shit-faced.

453
00:24:15,334 --> 00:24:16,695
- I'll deal with him.
- Fuckin' better.

454
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,277
- Don't even worry about it.
- What, you think I look fucking worried?

455
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,033
Sit down. Please, sit down.

456
00:24:20,068 --> 00:24:23,639
Jesus Christ, he's fuckin' retarded.

457
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:26,987
Jack-o! Give me another one, huh?

458
00:24:27,388 --> 00:24:28,746
Hey, Tommy.

459
00:24:28,881 --> 00:24:29,955
Yeah?

460
00:24:29,989 --> 00:24:32,040
You watch yourself.

461
00:24:35,673 --> 00:24:36,540
Mr. martorano,

462
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:39,584
you are one of the most
feared men in Boston

463
00:24:39,684 --> 00:24:42,054
and well-known as the chief executioner

464
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:43,734
for the winter hill gang.

465
00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:45,313
Is that correct?

466
00:24:45,479 --> 00:24:46,534
Yes.

467
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:51,397
You are also reputed to
have murdered some 20 people.

468
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:53,548
Would you say that is accurate?

469
00:24:53,636 --> 00:24:55,999
That is accurate, yes.

470
00:24:56,179 --> 00:24:59,257
Mr. martorano, I want you
to be as specific as possible

471
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:02,535
in answering why the
war between the angiulos

472
00:25:02,682 --> 00:25:05,178
and winter hill escalated.

473
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:07,685
Simple. Territory.

474
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,999
Specifically south Boston?

475
00:25:10,112 --> 00:25:12,036
Yes, southie.

476
00:25:13,061 --> 00:25:15,160
Angiulo wanted to control everything...

477
00:25:15,221 --> 00:25:18,789
Loan-sharking, vending
machines, all the rackets.

478
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:21,507
And there were consequences.

479
00:25:21,684 --> 00:25:22,410
Yeah.

480
00:25:22,471 --> 00:25:23,925
There was consequences.

481
00:25:25,916 --> 00:25:26,992
What the fuck?!

482
00:25:42,746 --> 00:25:44,418
Don't worry about it!

483
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,096
Tommy!

484
00:25:46,684 --> 00:25:48,803
Yeah. Fellas.

485
00:25:49,102 --> 00:25:51,397
We need you. We're looking for suitcase.

486
00:25:51,444 --> 00:25:54,270
Suitcase? The fuck did he do?

487
00:25:55,199 --> 00:25:57,137
He set up Mickey.

488
00:25:57,901 --> 00:25:59,605
Fuck me.

489
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,750
Hang on a minute.

490
00:26:03,045 --> 00:26:04,653
Hey, what's going on, Jimmy?

491
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,079
You guys looking for suitcase?

492
00:26:07,114 --> 00:26:09,012
I seen him up on winter
hill a few hours ago.

493
00:26:09,047 --> 00:26:10,390
Need me to jump in?

494
00:26:10,448 --> 00:26:12,875
Nah, we got it, buddy.

495
00:26:13,393 --> 00:26:15,467
What the fuck are you doing, Tommy?

496
00:26:15,535 --> 00:26:17,900
It's a fuckin' vest. You
got a problem with it?

497
00:26:22,595 --> 00:26:24,434
Makes you look like a faggot.

498
00:26:24,469 --> 00:26:25,345
We'll see who the faggot is

499
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,720
when it stops a couple of fuckin' bullets.

500
00:26:46,303 --> 00:26:48,277
Hey, Jimmy, about that bullshit

501
00:26:48,312 --> 00:26:49,420
the other night at triple o's,

502
00:26:49,455 --> 00:26:52,335
I was... I was fucking way out of line.

503
00:26:52,392 --> 00:26:54,655
Forget about it, Tommy. You was drunk.

504
00:26:54,742 --> 00:26:58,021
I know I was drunk, but
that ain't an excuse.

505
00:26:58,056 --> 00:26:58,879
Should never have fuckin' happened.

506
00:26:58,927 --> 00:27:00,515
No, it should never have happened.

507
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,297
But that's the thing.

508
00:27:02,392 --> 00:27:04,634
I want you to listen to me.

509
00:27:04,702 --> 00:27:07,099
- You need to keep an eye on it
- yeah.

510
00:27:07,134 --> 00:27:09,262
Because, you know, the juice,

511
00:27:09,317 --> 00:27:11,062
it'll sneak up and bite you on the ass,

512
00:27:11,138 --> 00:27:13,068
and you never know when,
you know what I mean?

513
00:27:13,103 --> 00:27:16,915
- Absolutely, absolutely.
- And I worry about you, that's all.

514
00:27:17,042 --> 00:27:18,920
- I'll keep an eye on it, I promise.
- Huh?

515
00:27:18,955 --> 00:27:20,293
I promise.

516
00:27:20,328 --> 00:27:22,247
We good?

517
00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:23,992
Yeah, we're good.

518
00:27:27,699 --> 00:27:31,531
Lots of good your vest did
you today, you fucking prick.

519
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,632
Put him in the trunk.

520
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,149
Why'd they kill Tommy?

521
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,248
I think Jim was convinced

522
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:46,072
that Tommy ratted out Mickey to angiulo.

523
00:27:46,236 --> 00:27:48,811
Either that or Tommy
raising a fist to Jimmy,

524
00:27:48,846 --> 00:27:51,719
which is never a good idea.

525
00:27:51,787 --> 00:27:53,464
Where'd they bury him?

526
00:27:53,556 --> 00:27:56,053
In Jim's favorite spot.

527
00:27:56,123 --> 00:27:59,026
Right there under the
bridge in neponset river.

528
00:28:00,442 --> 00:28:02,595
He buried so many bodies in that shithole,

529
00:28:02,677 --> 00:28:07,310
it became known as the
bulger burial ground.

530
00:28:09,143 --> 00:28:11,612
I don't know how you fuckers didn't get it.

531
00:28:11,766 --> 00:28:14,397
I really don't. I mean, in the beginning,

532
00:28:14,516 --> 00:28:15,913
Jim was a small-town player

533
00:28:15,954 --> 00:28:18,740
who really only mattered in southie.

534
00:28:18,914 --> 00:28:21,156
Don't get me wrong... he
was a tough motherfucker,

535
00:28:21,191 --> 00:28:24,047
but small-time.

536
00:28:24,297 --> 00:28:27,229
And then the next thing you
know, he's a goddamn kingpin.

537
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:29,164
You know why?

538
00:28:29,957 --> 00:28:32,004
Because the FBI let it happen.

539
00:28:41,396 --> 00:28:42,783
This is John.

540
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:44,802
Connolly.

541
00:28:45,815 --> 00:28:46,949
Jimmy.

542
00:28:46,982 --> 00:28:49,609
This is potentially the biggest opportunity

543
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,146
the bureau will ever have had

544
00:28:51,218 --> 00:28:53,491
in the history of the city of Boston,

545
00:28:53,526 --> 00:28:55,031
and you need time to think about it?

546
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,932
Before you go flying any
further off the handle,

547
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:02,041
it might help to recall that
whitey bulger is an ex-convict

548
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:05,350
and that his parole category
is "supervised released status,"

549
00:29:05,385 --> 00:29:08,262
a designation that we would
be required to get withdrawn

550
00:29:08,297 --> 00:29:11,354
or else we would be in
violation of bureau regulations.

551
00:29:11,389 --> 00:29:13,737
So? We withdraw or we violate.

552
00:29:13,772 --> 00:29:16,441
What we don't do, unless
we're clinically insane,

553
00:29:16,476 --> 00:29:18,591
is blow this chance!

554
00:29:19,393 --> 00:29:22,364
By the way, it's "Jimmy," not "whitey."

555
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,263
The only thing you're gonna get

556
00:29:23,298 --> 00:29:25,652
by calling him whitey is a fucking smack.

557
00:29:25,687 --> 00:29:27,055
Oh, is that so?

558
00:29:27,155 --> 00:29:29,565
So I'm supposed to cater
to this fucker's whims?

559
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,978
If it brings you angiulo, yes!

560
00:29:32,033 --> 00:29:34,274
And what makes you so sure

561
00:29:34,323 --> 00:29:35,820
that he's gonna be a reliable source?

562
00:29:35,855 --> 00:29:37,205
Because in my experience,

563
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,524
everyone of those winter hill pricks

564
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,640
is a double-crossing cocksucker.

565
00:29:40,742 --> 00:29:42,848
I grew up with him in southie.

566
00:29:43,175 --> 00:29:46,439
Jimmy, his brother Billy, and me.

567
00:29:46,486 --> 00:29:50,133
And that is a bond that doesn't get broken.

568
00:29:50,401 --> 00:29:53,314
I mean, if he gives me
his word, he will keep it.

569
00:29:53,368 --> 00:29:55,817
So we're relying on the word of criminals.

570
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:57,770
Jimmy's no ordinary criminal.

571
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,652
Well, you're right about that.

572
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,155
"A vicious animal who won't
take no for an answer."

573
00:30:03,199 --> 00:30:06,643
"Violent decisiveness
at any hint of betrayal."

574
00:30:06,773 --> 00:30:07,643
Oh!

575
00:30:07,678 --> 00:30:11,048
"A ripened psychopath determined
to succeed above all else."

576
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:12,906
I got a lot of respect for you, Charles,

577
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:16,127
but I cannot fucking
believe what I'm hearing.

578
00:30:16,195 --> 00:30:19,027
Four mafia murders in the
north end this month alone,

579
00:30:19,062 --> 00:30:21,676
and we don't have a
legitimate case on any of them.

580
00:30:21,711 --> 00:30:23,278
The angiulos are out there laughing at us

581
00:30:23,352 --> 00:30:26,054
like we're fuckin' a bunch of clowns!

582
00:30:26,152 --> 00:30:28,535
A bunch of clowns!

583
00:30:28,602 --> 00:30:29,484
Come on, guys.

584
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:33,061
If we're serious about
bringing down the Italians,

585
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:34,823
Jimmy is the only way.

586
00:30:34,856 --> 00:30:36,990
What about these LSD experiments in prison?

587
00:30:37,025 --> 00:30:38,243
He can't be stable.

588
00:30:38,278 --> 00:30:40,020
He did it for time off and money.

589
00:30:40,055 --> 00:30:41,505
And it was a handful of times.

590
00:30:41,566 --> 00:30:44,040
It was 50 times, John.

591
00:30:45,474 --> 00:30:47,323
Just trust me when I tell you

592
00:30:47,358 --> 00:30:51,727
he is a smart, stable motherfucker.

593
00:30:54,073 --> 00:30:56,126
What do you think, Morris?

594
00:30:59,398 --> 00:31:03,320
I think that we have more
to gain than to lose on this.

595
00:31:03,381 --> 00:31:05,283
I think we go with John.

596
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:09,789
I think we bring whitey...
Uh, Jimmy, into the tent.

597
00:31:16,996 --> 00:31:20,788
No drugs. No fuckin' murder, connolly.

598
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:26,681
_

599
00:31:30,761 --> 00:31:32,516
_

600
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:36,985
_

601
00:31:43,991 --> 00:31:47,430
you listen good, 'cause I'm
only gonna say this once.

602
00:31:47,654 --> 00:31:51,252
I will never hurt or adversely affect

603
00:31:51,287 --> 00:31:54,416
any of my friends or financial partners.

604
00:31:54,515 --> 00:31:58,440
I do not consider this
rattin' or informin'.

605
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,861
This is business.

606
00:31:59,934 --> 00:32:01,921
I couldn't have said it any better.

607
00:32:02,122 --> 00:32:03,901
You're a liaison.

608
00:32:04,035 --> 00:32:06,366
- You pretty much do whatever you want.
- _

609
00:32:06,416 --> 00:32:07,800
and no one's gonna raise an eyebrow

610
00:32:07,835 --> 00:32:10,961
so long as you're leadin' us
into some pretty big busts.

611
00:32:10,996 --> 00:32:12,337
There's just one restriction

612
00:32:12,372 --> 00:32:13,850
- on our side...
- _

613
00:32:15,113 --> 00:32:17,778
you can't kill anybody, Jimmy.

614
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:24,312
Kevin, did you know that
whitey was an informant?

615
00:32:24,367 --> 00:32:26,313
No, I didn't know.

616
00:32:26,419 --> 00:32:28,054
I mean, he hated rats.

617
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,380
We fuckin' buried rats, especially our own.

618
00:32:31,528 --> 00:32:33,920
I mean, I knew he had his
connections in the FBI.

619
00:32:33,955 --> 00:32:35,122
I knew he had his sources.

620
00:32:35,182 --> 00:32:36,789
But I figured he was playing them

621
00:32:36,824 --> 00:32:38,692
like he did everybody else.

622
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:41,903
But obviously, he had a plan.

623
00:32:45,846 --> 00:32:48,848
Where do you get the
energy for that shit, Jimmy?

624
00:32:51,058 --> 00:32:53,499
Hey, Steve. Hang on a minute.

625
00:32:55,416 --> 00:32:57,999
We've known each other a long fuckin' time.

626
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,474
Can I trust you, Stevie?

627
00:33:04,739 --> 00:33:06,410
You know you can trust me.

628
00:33:06,477 --> 00:33:07,992
Good.

629
00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:11,014
'Cause there's something
i want you to know.

630
00:33:13,506 --> 00:33:15,741
I'm making a deal with the feds.

631
00:33:16,538 --> 00:33:18,307
An alliance.

632
00:33:18,447 --> 00:33:20,336
You're informing to the FBI?

633
00:33:20,371 --> 00:33:24,136
<i>No. There's informing, and
then there's informing.</i>

634
00:33:24,262 --> 00:33:26,966
Informing, you should be fucking chopped up

635
00:33:27,021 --> 00:33:29,268
and put into a garbage bag, that's it.

636
00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:31,199
Informing, you're the scum of the scum.

637
00:33:31,247 --> 00:33:33,975
But it's not informing

638
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:36,684
when you're bringing down the cocksuckers

639
00:33:36,785 --> 00:33:39,527
who deserve to be brought down...

640
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:42,172
Like the fucking brits in the six counties

641
00:33:42,237 --> 00:33:45,643
or the goddamn dagos up in the north end.

642
00:33:45,765 --> 00:33:47,976
It's a business opportunity.

643
00:33:48,011 --> 00:33:51,916
Get the FBI to fight our wars

644
00:33:52,327 --> 00:33:55,009
against our enemies...

645
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,496
While they protect us,

646
00:33:57,557 --> 00:34:00,394
and we do whatever the fuck we want to do.

647
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,960
All right, Jimmy.

648
00:34:19,111 --> 00:34:21,495
There's a guy named John connolly.

649
00:34:21,703 --> 00:34:23,752
He's a southie boy. We grew up together.

650
00:34:23,787 --> 00:34:24,911
He's all right.

651
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:31,115
So, we're doing this?

652
00:34:31,264 --> 00:34:33,634
Yeah, we're gonna do this.

653
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,496
Ho-ho-ho!

654
00:35:05,754 --> 00:35:09,111
Shh, he's asleep. He's a little sick.

655
00:35:09,976 --> 00:35:13,248
He's a little sick? Sick with what?

656
00:35:13,386 --> 00:35:15,246
He's just got a fever.

657
00:35:15,365 --> 00:35:18,307
He'll be fine in a few days.
It's probably just the flu.

658
00:35:18,435 --> 00:35:20,699
Did you take him to the doctor?

659
00:35:20,734 --> 00:35:22,871
No, he'll be okay.

660
00:35:24,045 --> 00:35:26,982
Take him to the doctor
in the morning, would you?

661
00:35:47,465 --> 00:35:48,963
It's only a little, but it might get bigger

662
00:35:48,998 --> 00:35:51,447
because the hose, at this time of the year,

663
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,616
it's always leaking
and bursting, that pipe.

664
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,480
You want me to get tom to fix it?

665
00:35:55,567 --> 00:35:58,112
Sure. It's nice of you, Billy, thank you.

666
00:35:58,145 --> 00:36:01,081
No worries. No worries.

667
00:36:01,136 --> 00:36:04,405
Marianne, how are you
settling into southie?

668
00:36:04,486 --> 00:36:05,618
How do you find it?

669
00:36:05,653 --> 00:36:06,653
I like it.

670
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,165
It's taking a little getting used to,

671
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,953
but... it's different.

672
00:36:11,326 --> 00:36:13,128
Different how?

673
00:36:13,759 --> 00:36:15,764
I find it a rather tight-knit community.

674
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:18,881
And I could have hoped to have
met a few more people by now.

675
00:36:19,008 --> 00:36:21,417
You know, those sort of
things just take a little time

676
00:36:21,452 --> 00:36:24,012
and you need introductions to people.

677
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:25,604
Mary and I can help with
that. Can't we, Mary?

678
00:36:25,652 --> 00:36:27,137
Yeah, indeed we can, bill.

679
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:28,905
- That would be great, thank you.
- Once you settle in,

680
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,344
you'll find that people around
here are as good as gold.

681
00:36:31,379 --> 00:36:32,568
I'm sure that's true.

682
00:36:32,603 --> 00:36:34,156
Well, of course.

683
00:36:38,318 --> 00:36:42,249
<i>♪ Dashing through the snow
in a one-horse open sleigh ♪</i>

684
00:36:42,317 --> 00:36:44,642
<i>♪ o'er the fields we go,
laughing all the way ♪</i>

685
00:36:44,724 --> 00:36:49,679
All right, everybody. On
the count of 3... 1, 2, 3.

686
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:52,512
Merry Christmas, everybody!

687
00:36:52,547 --> 00:36:55,035
Boys, come back down here
in five minutes, you hear?

688
00:36:55,101 --> 00:36:56,094
Can we open presents?

689
00:36:56,135 --> 00:36:58,139
Open presents, right.

690
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,156
Whose turn is it first?

691
00:37:01,981 --> 00:37:03,050
That was you?

692
00:37:03,143 --> 00:37:04,563
I don't know how

693
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:06,380
your brother does it.

694
00:37:06,415 --> 00:37:07,159
What's that?

695
00:37:07,194 --> 00:37:09,096
Nine children.

696
00:37:09,552 --> 00:37:10,344
Oh.

697
00:37:10,475 --> 00:37:14,075
That's a complete mystery to me, as well.

698
00:37:14,228 --> 00:37:15,274
Hello?

699
00:37:16,544 --> 00:37:19,217
Hey, Stevie. I just wanted to say...

700
00:37:19,252 --> 00:37:20,715
I can't understand... calm down.

701
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:24,412
It's really good that you're comin' along.

702
00:37:24,483 --> 00:37:27,569
It makes things in my world a lot easier.

703
00:37:27,601 --> 00:37:28,442
All right, all right.

704
00:37:28,477 --> 00:37:30,929
- Sure, John.
- Hold on, hold on.

705
00:37:32,332 --> 00:37:34,155
Jimmy, phone.

706
00:37:34,693 --> 00:37:35,916
What?

707
00:37:36,122 --> 00:37:38,225
You need to take the call.

708
00:37:47,093 --> 00:37:50,206
Excuse me. Douglas cyr's room, please.

709
00:37:50,452 --> 00:37:52,051
Room 508, around the corner.

710
00:37:52,086 --> 00:37:53,701
Thank you.

711
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,397
How is he?

712
00:37:56,461 --> 00:37:58,365
He's in there right now with the doctor,

713
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,322
and they're saying that
it's reye's syndrome.

714
00:38:00,357 --> 00:38:01,896
What the fuck is reye's syndrome?

715
00:38:01,931 --> 00:38:03,626
- I thought it was the flu.
- I know, so did I.

716
00:38:03,661 --> 00:38:05,538
But then when you left,
i called the doctor,

717
00:38:05,573 --> 00:38:07,529
and they said to just
keep giving him aspirin

718
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:10,035
every four hours, just like
I'd been doing for days.

719
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,408
But then his fever got higher,

720
00:38:11,443 --> 00:38:15,254
and then... and then his
behavior started changing,

721
00:38:15,289 --> 00:38:17,550
and he became really angry to me.

722
00:38:17,585 --> 00:38:18,884
Okay.

723
00:38:18,919 --> 00:38:22,477
Like, really angry, and
his body was all stiff,

724
00:38:22,512 --> 00:38:23,803
so I brought him here, and they said

725
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:28,430
that the aspirin that I had been
giving him just made him worse.

726
00:38:28,717 --> 00:38:30,693
- No. No.
- Yeah, that's what they said!

727
00:38:30,728 --> 00:38:33,677
That's what they said...
That I made him worse.

728
00:38:51,052 --> 00:38:53,363
Sorry, no change.

729
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:03,417
I'm taking him home, Lindsey.

730
00:39:03,899 --> 00:39:05,948
I don't fucking care what they say.

731
00:39:05,983 --> 00:39:08,171
I want to take my boy home.

732
00:39:08,237 --> 00:39:10,123
He's not coming home, Jimmy.

733
00:39:10,158 --> 00:39:14,493
Don't say that, please. Don't say that.

734
00:39:20,462 --> 00:39:23,419
He's on life support, Jimmy.
He's not going anywhere.

735
00:39:23,506 --> 00:39:25,280
You got to accept it.

736
00:39:25,428 --> 00:39:28,562
I don't got to do fucking nothing.

737
00:39:30,428 --> 00:39:31,796
Look at me.

738
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:36,447
Jimmy, please look at me.

739
00:39:39,775 --> 00:39:43,457
He's never gonna be our
little boy again, never.

740
00:39:43,536 --> 00:39:44,552
Don't.

741
00:39:44,587 --> 00:39:45,984
- He's brain-dead.
- Don't say that.

742
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:48,902
He's on life support, he can't move,

743
00:39:48,937 --> 00:39:51,162
and I don't want him like that!

744
00:39:51,585 --> 00:39:54,171
I can't have my little boy be like that!

745
00:40:02,489 --> 00:40:04,525
I'll pull the plug myself.

746
00:40:04,731 --> 00:40:06,350
I will.

747
00:40:11,385 --> 00:40:12,986
What did you say?

748
00:40:21,746 --> 00:40:24,549
What the fuck did you just say?

749
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:28,461
My boy?

750
00:40:29,976 --> 00:40:33,134
You pull the plug on my boy?

751
00:40:33,385 --> 00:40:36,222
I can't have him like this, Jimmy.

752
00:40:39,384 --> 00:40:41,581
- How could you be so cold?
- Don't say that to me.

753
00:40:41,616 --> 00:40:44,043
- How could you be so cold?
- Don't say that.

754
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,143
I could never, ever.

755
00:40:45,178 --> 00:40:47,457
- Don't you dare fucking say that.
- You're pathetic.

756
00:40:47,492 --> 00:40:49,421
You of all people in
the whole fucking world

757
00:40:49,469 --> 00:40:52,655
- cannot say that to me!
- Who the fuck are you?

758
00:40:53,209 --> 00:40:55,458
You motherfucker.

759
00:40:56,127 --> 00:40:58,431
Go fuck yourself.

760
00:41:59,581 --> 00:42:01,202
Because you have been convicted

761
00:42:01,264 --> 00:42:04,065
of federal racketeering and murder charges

762
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,333
and aim to make a deal to spare your life,

763
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:10,421
I'd like to start with the
period of Mr. bulger's life

764
00:42:10,488 --> 00:42:12,178
after the death of his son,

765
00:42:12,213 --> 00:42:13,513
when his enterprise expanded

766
00:42:13,581 --> 00:42:18,242
and he became a so-called
"crime lord" of Boston.

767
00:42:22,988 --> 00:42:24,608
Okay.

768
00:42:35,089 --> 00:42:38,571
From what were you and Mr.
bulger making your money?

769
00:42:39,127 --> 00:42:40,834
Ah, it was a lot of things...

770
00:42:40,869 --> 00:42:42,949
Running dope on the streets of southie.

771
00:42:42,982 --> 00:42:46,360
We had the rackets. We had the ponies.

772
00:42:46,554 --> 00:42:48,024
Tenants on every corner.

773
00:42:48,093 --> 00:42:49,593
This ain't your neighborhood, whitey.

774
00:42:49,628 --> 00:42:51,030
Is that right?

775
00:42:51,175 --> 00:42:54,019
But we were making weekly collections.

776
00:42:54,094 --> 00:42:55,354
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!

777
00:42:55,469 --> 00:42:58,387
You name it, and yeah, we was doin' it.

778
00:42:58,834 --> 00:43:00,182
The lottery, Jimmy?

779
00:43:00,217 --> 00:43:02,230
- _
- What can I tell you, Billy boy?

780
00:43:02,265 --> 00:43:04,242
I went in on a ticket as a lark,

781
00:43:04,277 --> 00:43:07,233
and I fucking won, fair and square. What?

782
00:43:07,268 --> 00:43:09,910
Would you say winter hill was thriving?

783
00:43:10,022 --> 00:43:11,806
We were making a lot of money.

784
00:43:11,869 --> 00:43:14,501
Which meant we had to
pay off a lot of people,

785
00:43:14,603 --> 00:43:16,819
keep things running smooth, you know?

786
00:43:16,854 --> 00:43:20,388
Local street cops, feds, whatever.

787
00:43:20,423 --> 00:43:23,072
We were throwing money around like crazy.

788
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:25,265
And then there was those trips to Miami.

789
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,903
We were getting into the jai alai racket

790
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:29,232
with John Callahan

791
00:43:29,267 --> 00:43:32,437
and an individual named Brian halloran.

792
00:43:32,712 --> 00:43:35,189
Jimmy never really trusted him.

793
00:43:35,224 --> 00:43:37,794
I swear to god, I'll shoot
youse both in the face.

794
00:43:39,406 --> 00:43:41,727
For obvious reasons.

795
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:45,852
But he didn't think he could
make the deal without him.

796
00:43:45,958 --> 00:43:46,774
So...

797
00:43:46,818 --> 00:43:48,590
Right now, connolly, bulger and his crew

798
00:43:48,644 --> 00:43:50,171
are swanning around southie

799
00:43:50,206 --> 00:43:52,360
like a bunch of fucking
vikings, raping and pillaging,

800
00:43:52,414 --> 00:43:55,246
and we can't touch them because
they're no longer criminals.

801
00:43:55,313 --> 00:43:58,133
They're professional criminal consultants.

802
00:43:58,201 --> 00:43:59,468
But my question to you is,

803
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:02,158
have they actually given us
one concrete fucking thing

804
00:44:02,193 --> 00:44:03,015
that we can move on?

805
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:04,141
Just give me a fucking break!

806
00:44:04,176 --> 00:44:06,471
After the desert you been walking through?

807
00:44:06,567 --> 00:44:08,469
This is your ticket to the big time.

808
00:44:08,535 --> 00:44:09,655
And all you can do is fucking bitch.

809
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:11,780
All right, you fucking listen to me, John.

810
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:13,963
We have given bulger
miles and miles of leeway,

811
00:44:13,998 --> 00:44:17,121
and so far, he's given us dick in return.

812
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:20,195
I need a wire inside
angiulo's headquarters.

813
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,672
That fucker's been moving around so much,

814
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:23,954
I need to know specifically
where his fucking headquarters

815
00:44:23,989 --> 00:44:25,739
even are, and the fact that we don't

816
00:44:25,774 --> 00:44:28,360
makes us look like a bunch
of fucking keystone cops.

817
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:30,083
I need evidence that I can present

818
00:44:30,118 --> 00:44:31,511
to the federal prosecutor.

819
00:44:31,546 --> 00:44:33,064
And you'll get it.

820
00:44:33,242 --> 00:44:35,093
You got two weeks.

821
00:44:35,294 --> 00:44:37,251
That's fucking it!

822
00:44:37,837 --> 00:44:39,657
Then I pull the plug.

823
00:44:50,144 --> 00:44:52,599
Are you telling me that your
fucking boys at the bureau

824
00:44:52,634 --> 00:44:54,534
can't find angiulo's place?

825
00:44:54,569 --> 00:44:57,626
For fuck's sake, everyone in
Boston knows where the guy is!

826
00:44:57,661 --> 00:45:00,328
The fucker keeps moving
all over the north end.

827
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:02,110
I need specifics, Jimmy.

828
00:45:02,145 --> 00:45:05,700
Not tomorrow, not next week... now. Today.

829
00:45:05,787 --> 00:45:09,475
I need to get a wire inside
angiulo's headquarters,

830
00:45:09,536 --> 00:45:11,747
or I can't keep protecting you.

831
00:45:12,011 --> 00:45:13,820
It's that simple.

832
00:45:17,213 --> 00:45:18,570
All right.

833
00:45:18,885 --> 00:45:21,919
But I need you to do something for me.

834
00:45:22,691 --> 00:45:24,345
You want a fucking wiretap or not?

835
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:27,002
Jesus, Jimmy. Jimmy.

836
00:45:29,097 --> 00:45:31,287
I want all of angiulo's vending machines

837
00:45:31,342 --> 00:45:32,590
out of the old colony.

838
00:45:32,625 --> 00:45:35,816
I don't care how you do
it. I just want 'em gone.

839
00:45:35,909 --> 00:45:37,811
Do you follow?

840
00:45:39,652 --> 00:45:41,814
Do you fucking follow?

841
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,450
All right, then.

842
00:45:49,596 --> 00:45:52,680
When you leave for work tomorrow morning,

843
00:45:52,847 --> 00:45:57,078
after you've gone for your
jog down silver street...

844
00:45:57,309 --> 00:46:01,636
After you stopped at mcnulty's
for a black coffee and a Danish,

845
00:46:02,033 --> 00:46:04,416
after you read the sports page,

846
00:46:04,451 --> 00:46:06,696
after you kissed marianne goodbye,

847
00:46:06,731 --> 00:46:09,961
you walk straight out
your door to your car,

848
00:46:10,041 --> 00:46:11,943
which is parked in the same fuckin' spot

849
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:13,985
it's always parked in...

850
00:46:15,041 --> 00:46:18,244
Right before you put your
keys into the ignition,

851
00:46:18,551 --> 00:46:21,487
maybe have a look in the glove box.

852
00:46:24,903 --> 00:46:26,970
There just might be an
early Christmas present

853
00:46:27,005 --> 00:46:28,818
in there for you.

854
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:45,652
What's this?

855
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:48,060
Gentlemen, this is intel,

856
00:46:48,095 --> 00:46:50,759
from our source in winter hill.

857
00:46:53,154 --> 00:46:54,289
Holy shit.

858
00:46:54,324 --> 00:46:56,269
98 prince street.

859
00:46:56,407 --> 00:46:58,805
Angiulo family headquarters.

860
00:46:58,897 --> 00:46:59,754
Fuck me.

861
00:46:59,789 --> 00:47:02,943
Yeah, "fuck me" and fuck you is right.

862
00:47:03,216 --> 00:47:06,741
An hour ago, I got a
wet shave in a barbershop

863
00:47:06,776 --> 00:47:10,441
right across from 98 prince
in the heart of the north end,

864
00:47:10,535 --> 00:47:14,362
and within 15 minutes, I saw Mikey angiulo,

865
00:47:14,426 --> 00:47:17,952
Bobby carozza, and one
Vincent "the animal" ferrara

866
00:47:17,987 --> 00:47:20,285
- all go inside.
- Jesus, John.

867
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:24,057
Do you want to talk about
who's a valuable asset, Charles?

868
00:47:24,282 --> 00:47:25,915
In five fucking years of nobodies

869
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:28,143
with scotch on their
breath giving us shit...

870
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,817
Not a goddamn thing.

871
00:47:29,852 --> 00:47:31,359
And giving them 40 bucks
to go around the corner

872
00:47:31,394 --> 00:47:32,787
and get drunk and dick us around?

873
00:47:32,848 --> 00:47:35,123
Fuck that. This, on the other hand,

874
00:47:35,189 --> 00:47:36,613
is the kind of intel we get

875
00:47:36,648 --> 00:47:40,684
from James "whitey" bulger, gentlemen.

876
00:47:40,819 --> 00:47:42,637
No one else.

877
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,611
Jimmy always had a plan.

878
00:48:05,698 --> 00:48:09,570
Like him giving up angiulo's
address at 98 prince street.

879
00:48:09,777 --> 00:48:12,072
Now, that was a smart play

880
00:48:12,107 --> 00:48:18,303
because it kept connolly,
you know, off our backs.

881
00:48:18,636 --> 00:48:20,998
We had stuff going on in Florida.

882
00:48:21,165 --> 00:48:23,381
Situation down there was changing,

883
00:48:23,456 --> 00:48:25,588
and not for the better.

884
00:48:25,957 --> 00:48:28,793
World jai alai would like
to introduce its new owner,

885
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:32,868
c.E.O. And chief operating
officer Roger Wheeler.

886
00:48:32,922 --> 00:48:35,221
- Roger?
- Thank you, Alan.

887
00:48:35,416 --> 00:48:37,370
It's an exciting time for jai alai,

888
00:48:37,435 --> 00:48:39,286
and I'm honored to be part of its growth

889
00:48:39,337 --> 00:48:41,691
and expansion here in south Florida.

890
00:48:41,812 --> 00:48:45,519
John Callahan has us
poised for great success.

891
00:48:46,598 --> 00:48:49,053
I can't believe people
pay to watch this shit.

892
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:51,060
Well, they fucking love it, Stevie.

893
00:48:51,125 --> 00:48:52,991
They fucking love to bet on it.

894
00:48:53,026 --> 00:48:55,015
That's making us very rich.

895
00:48:55,155 --> 00:48:57,716
But who knows for how much
longer with Wheeler moving in?

896
00:48:57,784 --> 00:49:00,434
Guy's a fucking double-barreled prick.

897
00:49:00,491 --> 00:49:02,432
But at least we still got this.

898
00:49:02,514 --> 00:49:04,721
Oh, no, no, no. You give
that to Kevin, not me.

899
00:49:04,756 --> 00:49:05,973
All right.

900
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,778
So, what's the problem
with this Wheeler guy?

901
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:12,856
What's his deal?

902
00:49:12,891 --> 00:49:16,163
He's got cpas crawling all up my ass,

903
00:49:16,215 --> 00:49:18,643
all over the books,
checking every fucking thing.

904
00:49:18,678 --> 00:49:21,702
The cash flow, the free meals,
the parking-lot receipts.

905
00:49:21,802 --> 00:49:23,688
Just a matter of time before he finds out

906
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:25,148
how much cash is missing.

907
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:27,580
Just make him an offer for the company.

908
00:49:27,615 --> 00:49:29,832
Tried. Won't sell.

909
00:49:30,062 --> 00:49:32,222
Would his widow sell?

910
00:49:36,505 --> 00:49:38,350
Maybe she could be persuaded.

911
00:49:38,385 --> 00:49:42,241
Maybe balloonhead over here...
You could do us a favor.

912
00:49:42,276 --> 00:49:44,342
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

913
00:49:44,502 --> 00:49:45,339
Sure.

914
00:49:45,374 --> 00:49:47,074
Whatever you say, Stevie.

915
00:49:47,107 --> 00:49:49,170
But, you know, there
must be some other way.

916
00:49:49,238 --> 00:49:50,813
Yeah, but you don't get rid of him,

917
00:49:50,881 --> 00:49:53,003
how's he supposed to go away?

918
00:49:53,149 --> 00:49:55,527
What's the downside of this thing, John?

919
00:49:55,562 --> 00:49:57,343
There is no downside, Stevie.

920
00:49:57,378 --> 00:50:00,776
And the upside is, we get our
cut and keep printing money.

921
00:50:00,913 --> 00:50:01,988
I mean, what's to connect you

922
00:50:02,022 --> 00:50:03,626
to anything that happens to Wheeler?

923
00:50:03,687 --> 00:50:06,428
He lives in Tulsa, for fuck's sake!

924
00:50:07,585 --> 00:50:11,205
Everybody knows we have world jai alai.

925
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,821
Who's "everybody"?

926
00:50:12,856 --> 00:50:15,020
We're fucking everybody.

927
00:50:15,487 --> 00:50:16,824
Brian.

928
00:50:18,063 --> 00:50:20,432
Take the bag. I want you to have it.

929
00:50:23,043 --> 00:50:25,463
Yeah. I want you to have it.

930
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:26,801
No.

931
00:50:26,836 --> 00:50:28,160
Lot of money in that bag, Jimmy.

932
00:50:28,221 --> 00:50:30,915
I know exactly how much
money's in that fucking bag.

933
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:34,187
Brian, take the bag and get out of here.

934
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,668
To do the hit on... on Wheeler?

935
00:50:37,714 --> 00:50:38,722
No.

936
00:50:38,757 --> 00:50:44,298
<i>That's $20,000 for you
to not do the hit.</i>

937
00:50:47,459 --> 00:50:48,941
I don't get it.

938
00:50:49,036 --> 00:50:50,938
Take the money, keep
your fucking mouth shut

939
00:50:50,971 --> 00:50:52,413
about what you just heard.

940
00:50:52,448 --> 00:50:55,830
It's best you're not involved.
Take the fucking money.

941
00:50:55,865 --> 00:50:59,801
Take the fucking money.
Take the fucking money.

942
00:51:01,127 --> 00:51:02,858
Okay.

943
00:51:04,883 --> 00:51:06,125
Um...

944
00:51:07,905 --> 00:51:10,130
So I should go now?

945
00:51:10,327 --> 00:51:12,638
Yeah, you should go now.

946
00:51:16,363 --> 00:51:17,927
Thank you.

947
00:51:18,063 --> 00:51:20,066
You're welcome.

948
00:51:26,508 --> 00:51:28,557
Listen, I know you guys have your ways

949
00:51:28,592 --> 00:51:30,422
and everything like that, don't you?

950
00:51:30,457 --> 00:51:34,371
But don't ever hand me a bag
of fucking money in public.

951
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:37,184
I'm sorry, Jimmy. I just, I thought that...

952
00:51:37,256 --> 00:51:39,351
No, I know. I get it. It's all right.

953
00:51:39,386 --> 00:51:41,432
Don't sweat it. But I mean...

954
00:51:43,227 --> 00:51:44,520
All right.

955
00:51:44,633 --> 00:51:45,926
Never again.

956
00:51:45,995 --> 00:51:49,368
But we're good with Wheeler, right?

957
00:52:05,263 --> 00:52:06,685
Afternoon, Mr. Wheeler!

958
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,042
Howdy.

959
00:52:32,029 --> 00:52:33,386
Roger Wheeler?

960
00:52:42,182 --> 00:52:43,791
<i>What the fuck is this jai alai thing</i>

961
00:52:43,826 --> 00:52:46,844
<i>that whitey's got his
fingers into all of a sudden?</i>

962
00:52:46,879 --> 00:52:48,247
<i>What is this bullshit?</i>

963
00:52:48,302 --> 00:52:50,005
<i>That's the word on the street.</i>

964
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,328
<i>Looks like a stupid
fucking game, you ask me.</i>

965
00:52:52,363 --> 00:52:53,892
<i>Yeah, well, I'll tell ya.</i>

966
00:52:53,927 --> 00:52:55,441
<i>I don't picture bulger
going all the way</i>

967
00:52:55,476 --> 00:52:57,894
<i>out to Tulsa, Oklahoma,
to kill somebody.</i>

968
00:52:57,954 --> 00:53:00,410
<i>But then again, he's
such a sick little fuck.</i>

969
00:53:00,445 --> 00:53:03,287
<i>And that stupid half-breed
buddy of his, flemmi.</i>

970
00:53:03,335 --> 00:53:05,433
<i>The two of them, they'll
go anywhere, anytime</i>

971
00:53:05,509 --> 00:53:08,837
<i>and whack anybody out if there's
a few bucks in it for them.</i>

972
00:53:08,872 --> 00:53:11,271
I got to shut this
fucking thing down, John.

973
00:53:11,306 --> 00:53:13,846
Now we got people on tape

974
00:53:13,894 --> 00:53:17,057
talking about how whitey
and flemmi committed murder.

975
00:53:17,096 --> 00:53:19,587
That is a big fucking problem.

976
00:53:19,622 --> 00:53:23,145
That tape is just gangsters talking shit

977
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:24,608
like little fucking housewives.

978
00:53:24,643 --> 00:53:26,703
Yeah, maybe. But I got
to tell you something.

979
00:53:26,738 --> 00:53:28,844
Mcguire is gonna start asking questions.

980
00:53:28,892 --> 00:53:31,724
That is why I'm gonna file it very deep.

981
00:53:31,759 --> 00:53:34,248
All right? Problem gone.

982
00:53:34,283 --> 00:53:35,067
Gone.

983
00:53:35,102 --> 00:53:36,188
That's against protocol.

984
00:53:36,223 --> 00:53:37,959
Fuck protocol.

985
00:53:38,275 --> 00:53:39,395
Fuck it.

986
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:40,323
It's a little lie,

987
00:53:40,364 --> 00:53:44,578
a little white lie to
protect the bigger truth.

988
00:53:44,733 --> 00:53:47,141
You know what Jimmy has given us.

989
00:53:47,216 --> 00:53:49,351
A gold mine.

990
00:53:50,426 --> 00:53:53,853
And do you want to be the
person that jeopardizes that?

991
00:53:54,015 --> 00:53:58,412
We are bringing down the house, man.

992
00:53:58,502 --> 00:54:00,648
La cosa nostra.

993
00:54:00,858 --> 00:54:03,127
So just relax.

994
00:54:03,797 --> 00:54:05,188
Relax.

995
00:54:05,786 --> 00:54:07,762
I'll handle it. It's on me.

996
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:09,695
I got this.

997
00:54:15,103 --> 00:54:18,416
<i>Authorities in Tulsa, Oklahoma,
are still sifting through clues</i>

998
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:21,888
<i>in the murder of Roger Wheeler,
head of the telex corporation.</i>

999
00:54:21,943 --> 00:54:24,408
<i>- Today, telex offered a large reward...
- Turn it up.</i>

1000
00:54:24,443 --> 00:54:26,159
<i>...for information leading
to the arrest of the killer.</i>

1001
00:54:26,194 --> 00:54:29,075
Hey! Turn it the fuck up!

1002
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:31,623
<i>...Wheeler's more controversial
business holdings.</i>

1003
00:54:31,698 --> 00:54:33,801
<i>Sandy gilmore has a report.</i>

1004
00:54:35,642 --> 00:54:38,056
<i>Roger Wheeler was gunned
down at close range</i>

1005
00:54:38,104 --> 00:54:40,039
<i>as he left his weekly golf game.</i>

1006
00:54:40,074 --> 00:54:42,910
<i>Wheeler was a self-made,
hard-driving entrepren...</i>

1007
00:54:50,522 --> 00:54:52,478
What do you want, huh?

1008
00:55:04,574 --> 00:55:07,172
This meeting between
Rizzo and sal manzinni.

1009
00:55:07,207 --> 00:55:08,670
The walk-in in interview 3

1010
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:11,541
says whitey bulger killed Roger Wheeler.

1011
00:55:15,259 --> 00:55:18,076
Gentlemen, this is Brian halloran.

1012
00:55:18,209 --> 00:55:20,333
You have something you want to tell us?

1013
00:55:22,273 --> 00:55:24,968
There's a lot I can tell
you. I need guarantees first.

1014
00:55:25,003 --> 00:55:27,313
Fuck you. You don't get no guarantees.

1015
00:55:27,346 --> 00:55:29,149
You talk or you walk.

1016
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,641
Okay.

1017
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:40,031
Whitey bulger planned
to murder Roger Wheeler,

1018
00:55:40,096 --> 00:55:41,478
that jai alai dude from Tulsa.

1019
00:55:41,513 --> 00:55:42,956
It's been on the news and everything.

1020
00:55:43,017 --> 00:55:44,843
- Tulsa?
- Mm-hmm.

1021
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:49,618
Oh. So, what does some
random jai alai guy in Tulsa

1022
00:55:49,681 --> 00:55:51,618
have to do with whitey bulger?

1023
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:53,835
Whitey was pulling down
some serious coin in jai alai

1024
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:55,387
until Wheeler bought the fucking thing,

1025
00:55:55,422 --> 00:55:57,558
and he didn't want to
cut whitey in for a piece.

1026
00:55:57,593 --> 00:55:58,628
So...

1027
00:55:58,814 --> 00:56:01,401
You two know anything about this?

1028
00:56:01,487 --> 00:56:02,481
Psh.

1029
00:56:03,047 --> 00:56:04,418
Go on.

1030
00:56:05,802 --> 00:56:08,464
Bulger paid me 20 grand to
keep quiet about the hit.

1031
00:56:08,537 --> 00:56:10,382
Listen, you got to protect me.

1032
00:56:10,417 --> 00:56:11,605
'Cause if you don't, I'm fuckin' dead!

1033
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,718
What weapon was used on Wheeler?

1034
00:56:13,785 --> 00:56:16,445
How should I know? I didn't do
the hit. Johnny martorano did.

1035
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,106
How do you know it was martorano?

1036
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:21,326
Look, I make my living
on the streets, okay?

1037
00:56:21,361 --> 00:56:23,221
All right? I know these things.

1038
00:56:23,289 --> 00:56:25,858
Hey, look! Look at me!
You got to protect me.

1039
00:56:25,919 --> 00:56:28,305
Well, so far, you haven't given us anything

1040
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:29,829
to merit protection.

1041
00:56:29,898 --> 00:56:31,340
Are you fuckin' deaf?

1042
00:56:31,375 --> 00:56:33,070
I just gave you two fucking names!

1043
00:56:33,105 --> 00:56:36,364
Where was this so-called
meeting taking place?

1044
00:56:38,036 --> 00:56:39,445
You...

1045
00:56:40,984 --> 00:56:43,162
All right, all right.

1046
00:56:43,335 --> 00:56:44,720
Okay.

1047
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:47,325
I'm in Miami, I hear Jimmy's in town,

1048
00:56:47,391 --> 00:56:49,518
and I tag along to a little spot

1049
00:56:49,581 --> 00:56:51,838
with Steve flemmi, Jimmy,

1050
00:56:51,906 --> 00:56:55,428
and this other guy... guy, Callahan.

1051
00:56:55,644 --> 00:56:57,257
And I'm just minding
my own fucking business,

1052
00:56:57,292 --> 00:57:00,281
and then Callahan says
that he thinks that Wheeler

1053
00:57:00,357 --> 00:57:01,521
is gonna be a problem.

1054
00:57:01,602 --> 00:57:04,225
And then Jimmy says,

1055
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,966
"do you think his widow would be willing

1056
00:57:06,021 --> 00:57:08,062
- to sell the franchise?"
- His widow?

1057
00:57:08,123 --> 00:57:10,454
Mm-hmm. We all know
what that means, right?

1058
00:57:10,535 --> 00:57:13,305
And then flemmi asked me
if I could take care of it.

1059
00:57:14,224 --> 00:57:16,640
Would you take a lie detector?

1060
00:57:16,755 --> 00:57:18,580
Okay.

1061
00:57:18,648 --> 00:57:20,770
- Yeah?
- No.

1062
00:57:20,857 --> 00:57:23,171
'Cause then you might start
asking me other questions.

1063
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:25,826
Right? And next thing I know, boom!

1064
00:57:25,861 --> 00:57:28,402
You got me on like 15 other
things I didn't even do!

1065
00:57:28,435 --> 00:57:31,489
"Boom"? What did you not do, Brian?

1066
00:57:31,524 --> 00:57:35,061
Did you not kill your drug
dealers in a Chinese restaurant?

1067
00:57:35,152 --> 00:57:36,903
'Cause that's why you're really here.

1068
00:57:36,938 --> 00:57:38,552
That's all over the fucking street,

1069
00:57:38,613 --> 00:57:40,388
so you thought you'd come in here

1070
00:57:40,469 --> 00:57:42,845
and try and cop some
immunity before the fact.

1071
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,301
That's what's really going on, isn't it,

1072
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:46,221
you coke-snorting piece of shit?

1073
00:57:46,302 --> 00:57:47,939
Connolly?

1074
00:57:50,848 --> 00:57:53,652
I'm a fuckin' dead man!

1075
00:58:02,036 --> 00:58:03,243
What do you think?

1076
00:58:03,278 --> 00:58:08,136
I don't believe a fucking
word that guy says.

1077
00:58:08,742 --> 00:58:10,795
I say we cut him loose.

1078
00:58:10,874 --> 00:58:12,906
He's a drug addict.

1079
00:58:13,493 --> 00:58:14,803
Morris?

1080
00:58:17,586 --> 00:58:18,758
Yeah.

1081
00:58:18,917 --> 00:58:22,955
He won't take a polygraph? Cut him loose.

1082
00:58:27,079 --> 00:58:28,362
Yeah.

1083
00:58:40,303 --> 00:58:41,561
Our dear Saint Patrick...

1084
00:58:41,596 --> 00:58:44,027
He fought off the British and the romans,

1085
00:58:44,078 --> 00:58:46,503
- brutal outsiders who wanted to enslave
- _

1086
00:58:46,538 --> 00:58:47,709
the good people of Ireland.

1087
00:58:47,744 --> 00:58:49,944
And, today... well, today,

1088
00:58:49,979 --> 00:58:52,853
we bostonians face a similar invasion.

1089
00:58:52,892 --> 00:58:56,626
Drugs, violent crimes
ravaging our communities.

1090
00:58:56,691 --> 00:58:59,226
You know, today we fight a new fight,

1091
00:58:59,261 --> 00:59:03,055
a fight so our children and their children,

1092
00:59:03,090 --> 00:59:05,042
and children for generations to come

1093
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:09,415
can share the Boston we
hold so dear in our hearts.

1094
00:59:09,496 --> 00:59:13,819
So today, to all snakes, we say,
"get the hell out of Boston!"

1095
00:59:13,891 --> 00:59:16,403
"You'll find no shelter here!"

1096
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:18,543
To Saint Patrick!

1097
00:59:26,245 --> 00:59:28,655
Let's hear it for these boys! Come on, now!

1098
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:31,654
Billy boy! Billy boy!

1099
00:59:31,689 --> 00:59:33,561
Give them a hand!

1100
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,383
Jimmy! Where the fuck have you been?

1101
00:59:41,443 --> 00:59:43,006
I been looking for you everywhere.

1102
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:45,210
Oh, hey. Come here with me.

1103
00:59:45,245 --> 00:59:47,003
Come here.

1104
00:59:47,284 --> 00:59:50,414
<i>Don't you fucking ever talk
to me in public like that again.</i>

1105
00:59:50,475 --> 00:59:52,710
Did you kill Roger Wheeler?

1106
00:59:53,779 --> 00:59:56,380
The businessman from Tulsa.
Did you have him killed?

1107
00:59:56,415 --> 00:59:58,569
Why the fuck would I go to Tulsa

1108
00:59:58,604 --> 01:00:02,756
to kill some fucking
prick I don't even know?

1109
01:00:02,826 --> 01:00:04,456
That's bad for fuckin' business.

1110
01:00:04,491 --> 01:00:07,992
I know that you have a
hand in the world jai alai.

1111
01:00:08,027 --> 01:00:11,640
Huh? And suddenly, the new owner gets shot.

1112
01:00:12,801 --> 01:00:15,499
I suggest you think these things through

1113
01:00:15,534 --> 01:00:19,026
before you make unfounded
accusations against me.

1114
01:00:19,061 --> 01:00:20,640
All right, all right.

1115
01:00:21,593 --> 01:00:23,008
Just...

1116
01:00:23,408 --> 01:00:26,278
By the way, let me ask you a question.

1117
01:00:28,572 --> 01:00:31,509
How did you know we was
involved in jai alai?

1118
01:00:44,576 --> 01:00:47,252
Happy Saint Patrick's day. How are you?

1119
01:00:58,898 --> 01:01:01,421
Everybody always commented
on my work, right.

1120
01:01:01,456 --> 01:01:03,289
- Sure, they did.
- They did! They did!

1121
01:01:03,363 --> 01:01:07,063
I was in the low post, I was driving
it in hard, like fuckin' mchale!

1122
01:01:07,098 --> 01:01:07,727
How could you fuckin' take that?

1123
01:01:07,762 --> 01:01:10,589
- I was!
- You got short arms!

1124
01:01:10,624 --> 01:01:12,442
I don't got short arms.

1125
01:01:12,477 --> 01:01:14,894
You know who had short arms?

1126
01:01:15,095 --> 01:01:18,113
Nate "tiny" Archibald had short arms.

1127
01:01:18,203 --> 01:01:19,398
So there's hope.

1128
01:01:19,544 --> 01:01:21,466
Ah, fuck!

1129
01:01:21,501 --> 01:01:22,663
Fuck!

1130
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:23,626
Oh, god!

1131
01:01:23,661 --> 01:01:25,209
Oh, god!

1132
01:01:25,244 --> 01:01:26,139
Jimmy!

1133
01:01:50,801 --> 01:01:52,386
Jimmy!

1134
01:01:52,451 --> 01:01:53,767
No!

1135
01:01:54,556 --> 01:01:55,699
No, no, no, no!

1136
01:01:55,734 --> 01:01:57,428
No, no, no, no, no!

1137
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:59,731
No!

1138
01:02:12,135 --> 01:02:13,679
What the hell happened?

1139
01:02:13,714 --> 01:02:15,054
Get back inside!

1140
01:02:17,223 --> 01:02:19,259
Yeah, yeah, call the police!

1141
01:02:21,659 --> 01:02:23,028
Morris!

1142
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:25,979
Connolly!

1143
01:02:26,329 --> 01:02:28,782
Brian halloran was just gunned
down in broad fucking daylight.

1144
01:02:28,817 --> 01:02:31,699
You want to tell me how the fuck
you just let him walk out the door?

1145
01:02:31,828 --> 01:02:34,698
We're not running a hotel, Charles.

1146
01:02:34,745 --> 01:02:37,569
The guy wouldn't even
take a polygraph test.

1147
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:41,837
How did word even leak that
halloran was in here? Huh?

1148
01:02:41,996 --> 01:02:45,045
Are you pointing the finger at me?

1149
01:02:45,272 --> 01:02:47,553
Should I be?

1150
01:02:47,706 --> 01:02:49,398
I don't know, Charles.

1151
01:02:49,433 --> 01:02:51,640
You know, people talk.

1152
01:02:51,836 --> 01:02:53,160
What are we supposed to do?

1153
01:02:53,228 --> 01:02:55,591
Put this piece of shit in
a witness protection program

1154
01:02:55,626 --> 01:02:58,971
when we can't even validate a
single fucking thing he says?

1155
01:02:59,029 --> 01:03:00,933
And you're pointing the finger at me?

1156
01:03:00,978 --> 01:03:02,892
I'm trying to bring down the Italian mafia

1157
01:03:02,927 --> 01:03:04,370
with the help of Jimmy bulger,

1158
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:07,222
and you're pointing the
finger at fucking me?

1159
01:03:07,257 --> 01:03:08,794
Fuck you!

1160
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:13,429
Hey. You motherfuckers from southie

1161
01:03:13,464 --> 01:03:15,435
have some kind of sick
faggot love for each other?

1162
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:17,102
Did you just call me a faggot, huh?

1163
01:03:17,137 --> 01:03:18,619
That's it. That's it.

1164
01:03:18,654 --> 01:03:19,295
Come here!

1165
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:20,979
- That's it.
- Fucking faggot!

1166
01:03:21,014 --> 01:03:23,563
- You're making my point exactly, connolly.
- Come on!

1167
01:03:23,598 --> 01:03:26,641
I'm putting an end to this
bulger and flemmi informer shit.

1168
01:03:26,676 --> 01:03:27,967
- You can't do that! No!
- You cannot tell me

1169
01:03:28,002 --> 01:03:30,313
that they're not connected to this killing!

1170
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:31,562
You cannot fucking tell me that!

1171
01:03:31,597 --> 01:03:33,876
It's too important! You can't do it!

1172
01:03:33,911 --> 01:03:35,262
- Guys, guys, guys!
- It's fucking over.

1173
01:03:35,297 --> 01:03:38,403
You got to fucking listen
to this. It's angiulo.

1174
01:03:38,544 --> 01:03:40,635
I think we finally fucking got him.

1175
01:03:45,759 --> 01:03:47,550
<i>Well, rico does not cover us.</i>

1176
01:03:47,598 --> 01:03:50,113
<i>- Isn't that right?
- Mr. angiulo,</i>

1177
01:03:50,202 --> 01:03:52,532
<i>we're not infiltrating
legitimate businesses.</i>

1178
01:03:52,576 --> 01:03:54,279
<i>I wouldn't be in a
legitimate business</i>

1179
01:03:54,347 --> 01:03:56,743
<i>for all the fucking
money in the world.</i>

1180
01:03:56,797 --> 01:03:59,772
<i>We're selling marijuana.
We're not infiltrating.</i>

1181
01:03:59,826 --> 01:04:01,406
<i>We're illegal here, legal there.</i>

1182
01:04:01,441 --> 01:04:03,454
<i>Arsonists. We're
every fuckin' thing.</i>

1183
01:04:03,528 --> 01:04:06,329
<i>Pimps? So what? Prostitutes?</i>

1184
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:09,575
<i>Yeah. Yeah, we're a
fucking bookmaker.</i>

1185
01:04:11,386 --> 01:04:15,184
And finally, they hit the mother lode.

1186
01:04:15,379 --> 01:04:18,468
They got angiulo talking
bookmaking, loan-sharking,

1187
01:04:18,543 --> 01:04:23,397
and use of arson, how he
handled his pimps and his pros.

1188
01:04:24,154 --> 01:04:25,121
You must have heard...

1189
01:04:25,181 --> 01:04:26,719
They called him "the mafia hunter,"

1190
01:04:26,781 --> 01:04:28,334
"the bureau's shining star,"

1191
01:04:28,369 --> 01:04:31,835
"the man who cleaned
out Boston's underworld".

1192
01:04:31,902 --> 01:04:33,579

Mr. martorano, were you in
Miami in the spring of 1982?

1208
01:05:21,549 --> 01:05:22,655
Yes.

1209
01:05:22,803 --> 01:05:27,525
Was John connolly in Miami in
the spring of 1982, as well?

1210
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,144
Yes, he was.

1211
01:05:29,179 --> 01:05:30,150
Describe the circumstance

1212
01:05:30,251 --> 01:05:33,469

1215
01:05:38,756 --> 01:05:42,575
the bond, between Jimmy
and connolly stronger.

1216
01:05:42,694 --> 01:05:44,194
How was that?

1217
01:05:44,251 --> 01:05:47,126
Jimmy had some loose ends to tie up.

1218
01:05:47,217 --> 01:05:48,865
I think he thought having connolly along

1219
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:50,669
wasn't such a bad idea.

Just for the record,

1236
01:07:09,506 --> 01:07:12,408
you killed John Callahan
that night in Miami...

1237
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:16,470
Shot him in the head and stuffed
him in the trunk of his own car.

1238
01:07:16,704 --> 01:07:18,197
Yes.

1239
01:07:18,303 --> 01:07:20,913
Was John connolly aware of that fact?

1240
01:07:21,010 --> 01:07:23,112
Yes, he was.

1241
01:07:23,615 --> 01:07:25,161
I see.

1242
01:07:34,385 --> 01:07:36,212
Is that a new suit?

1243
01:07:43,424 --> 01:07:45,710
It's flashier, no?

1244
01:07:46,157 --> 01:07:48,792
Those lapels, that tapering.

1245
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:52,370
I see you got a nice,
new gold watch there, too.

1246
01:07:53,764 --> 01:07:54,879
What are you getting at, marianne?

1247
01:07:54,914 --> 01:07:56,429
Nothing. Not anything.

1248
01:07:56,462 --> 01:07:58,283
- Marianne?
- Hmm?

1249
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:01,823
You're dressing differently.
You're walking differently.

1250
01:08:01,858 --> 01:08:03,275
You're getting manicures.

1251
01:08:03,363 --> 01:08:06,125
Uhh... I'm walking differently?

1252
01:08:06,199 --> 01:08:07,347
Yeah, I think you are.

1253
01:08:07,428 --> 01:08:10,332
Your head and your shoulders,
the way you carry yourself.

1254
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:11,476
You're changing, John.

1255
01:08:11,509 --> 01:08:14,107
I'm not changing. I'm not changing!

1256
01:08:14,142 --> 01:08:17,273
I'm... I might be getting
older, but I'm not changing.

1257
01:08:17,308 --> 01:08:18,782
It's Jimmy bulger that's changing you.

1258
01:08:18,849 --> 01:08:20,029
Ah, here we go.

1259
01:08:20,064 --> 01:08:22,333
Ever since you locked arms
with that guy, you've changed.

1260
01:08:22,427 --> 01:08:24,307
I can see it like the nose on my face.

1261
01:08:24,368 --> 01:08:25,540
He's bad news, John.

1262
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:26,790
He's not bad news.

1263
01:08:26,851 --> 01:08:28,232
He is an informant.

1264
01:08:28,346 --> 01:08:29,932
It's my job.

1265
01:08:29,967 --> 01:08:32,100
You know this. I told you this.

1266
01:08:32,135 --> 01:08:34,476
I've known him since forever.

1267
01:08:34,539 --> 01:08:37,059
And you certainly hold your
boyhood heroes in high regard.

1268
01:08:37,094 --> 01:08:38,695
"Jimmy" this, "Jimmy" that.

1269
01:08:38,771 --> 01:08:41,671
He was very good to me
when I was little, marianne.

1270
01:08:41,755 --> 01:08:42,813
That's all you need to know.

1271
01:08:42,881 --> 01:08:44,879
How was he good to you, John?

1272
01:08:44,999 --> 01:08:46,205
Did he take you
trick-or-treating?

1273
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:50,077
I know that it's kids' stuff to you, maybe.

1274
01:08:50,961 --> 01:08:53,131
I'm gonna go for a drive.

1275
01:08:53,478 --> 01:08:54,578
Fuck.

1276
01:08:56,678 --> 01:08:58,917
Like it or not, marianne,
you married a street kid.

1277
01:08:58,990 --> 01:09:00,173
And the streets taught me

1278
01:09:00,241 --> 01:09:03,360
that you give and you get
loyalty from your friends.

1279
01:09:05,515 --> 01:09:07,652
And loyalty means a lot to me.

1280
01:09:12,169 --> 01:09:13,869
You lock it.

1281
01:09:20,009 --> 01:09:21,783
"In the eyes of the unwise,

1282
01:09:21,849 --> 01:09:24,051
they did appear to die.

1283
01:09:24,956 --> 01:09:27,132
Their going looked like a disaster,

1284
01:09:27,924 --> 01:09:30,269
but they are in peace.

1285
01:09:31,465 --> 01:09:34,389
If they experienced
punishment as men see it,

1286
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:38,332
their hope was rich with immortality.

1287
01:09:38,445 --> 01:09:41,078
God has put them to the test

1288
01:09:41,126 --> 01:09:44,183
and proved them worthy to be with him.

1289
01:09:44,317 --> 01:09:47,766
He has tested them like gold in a furnace.

1290
01:09:47,897 --> 01:09:52,059
They who trust in him
will understand the truth."

1291
01:09:52,232 --> 01:09:56,110
In the name of the father and
the son and the holy spirit.

1292
01:09:56,145 --> 01:09:56,675
Amen.

1293
01:09:56,710 --> 01:09:58,293
Amen.

1294
01:10:03,113 --> 01:10:06,124
That's a pity that Jimmy
couldn't pallbearer with us.

1295
01:10:06,178 --> 01:10:11,420
I know, but he was just
protecting the family name.

1296
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:13,315
He's a...

1297
01:10:14,499 --> 01:10:16,368
He's a good man.

1298
01:10:20,317 --> 01:10:24,001
I remember sitting at
this very table with you

1299
01:10:24,062 --> 01:10:27,377
some 20 years ago, working
on my first campaign.

1300
01:10:29,201 --> 01:10:30,669
I was stuffing envelopes

1301
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:33,773
and licking stamps until my tongue was dry.

1302
01:10:35,134 --> 01:10:37,207
Oh, Jesus, we were just kids.

1303
01:10:37,282 --> 01:10:38,371
Mm-hmm.

1304
01:10:38,476 --> 01:10:40,414
Now look at us.

1305
01:10:47,495 --> 01:10:48,746
John.

1306
01:10:48,781 --> 01:10:51,520
I'm very sorry for your loss, Jimmy.

1307
01:10:51,632 --> 01:10:53,503
Your mother was a good woman.

1308
01:10:53,538 --> 01:10:55,026
Thanks.

1309
01:10:55,574 --> 01:11:00,082
Well, I'll let you guys have some time.

1310
01:11:00,418 --> 01:11:01,909
God bless.

1311
01:11:22,166 --> 01:11:23,980
It's so quiet.

1312
01:11:30,114 --> 01:11:32,757
Never heard this house so quiet.

1313
01:11:34,986 --> 01:11:39,317
First his son died, then his mother passed.

1314
01:11:40,003 --> 01:11:42,457
And Jimmy was devastated.

1315
01:11:42,609 --> 01:11:44,756
He was never the same.

1316
01:11:44,849 --> 01:11:46,549
The only time he ever seemed happy

1317
01:11:46,584 --> 01:11:48,692
was when he was talking about the I.R.A.

1318
01:11:52,645 --> 01:11:54,092
How you doing?

1319
01:11:54,299 --> 01:11:56,395
Jimmy bulger, Joe Cahill.

1320
01:11:56,474 --> 01:11:58,050
I know who Jimmy is.

1321
01:11:58,118 --> 01:12:00,170
And I know who Joe Cahill is.

1322
01:12:00,235 --> 01:12:01,447
It's a real pleasure, sir.

1323
01:12:01,482 --> 01:12:03,756
- Thank you, Jimmy.
- Come on in, Joe.

1324
01:12:03,791 --> 01:12:06,952
We're really deep in it, Jimmy,
and we gonna need your help.

1325
01:12:06,987 --> 01:12:07,803
Well, you're gonna get it.

1326
01:12:07,838 --> 01:12:09,474
<i>Police had laid virtual siege</i>

1327
01:12:09,509 --> 01:12:10,848
<i>to the I.R.A. Man's home,</i>

1328
01:12:10,903 --> 01:12:12,853
<i>obviously determined
not to let the provos</i>

1329
01:12:12,888 --> 01:12:15,051
<i>stage a repeat of the
paramilitary funeral</i>

1330
01:12:15,105 --> 01:12:17,203
<i>they gave his cousin shot
by the s.A.S. Two weeks ago.</i>

1331
01:12:17,277 --> 01:12:19,313
So, you can see what we're up against.

1332
01:12:19,405 --> 01:12:21,056
It's pure evil.

1333
01:12:21,569 --> 01:12:23,691
Joe, on my honor,

1334
01:12:23,818 --> 01:12:26,548
I can promise that you will
have the biggest weapons' cache

1335
01:12:26,597 --> 01:12:28,945
you ever laid your Irish eyes on.

1336
01:12:29,081 --> 01:12:30,405
I have to tell you, that would be

1337
01:12:30,466 --> 01:12:32,970
a rather large arsenal, indeed.

1338
01:12:33,313 --> 01:12:35,420
We're not choirboys.

1339
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:39,576
I want you to know I'm
here for you, always.

1340
01:12:39,893 --> 01:12:42,230
The old country thanks you, Jimmy.

1341
01:12:45,294 --> 01:12:46,310
Sláinte.

1342
01:12:46,345 --> 01:12:47,152
Sláinte.

1343
01:12:47,492 --> 01:12:49,170
Say cheese!

1344
01:12:49,299 --> 01:12:50,601
Thanks for all the support.

1345
01:12:50,668 --> 01:12:52,069
Jerry, Jerry.

1346
01:12:52,130 --> 01:12:53,492
Dawg.

1347
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:57,196
Congratulations. And a hell of a career.

1348
01:12:57,231 --> 01:12:58,143
Thank you, John.

1349
01:12:58,209 --> 01:12:59,602
And same for you, huh?

1350
01:12:59,657 --> 01:13:02,332
Raise, promotion, the whole shebang.

1351
01:13:02,425 --> 01:13:04,927
Enough about me. What's
next for you, champ?

1352
01:13:04,962 --> 01:13:07,405
Tell you the truth, I don't really care.

1353
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,219
Enough of this public sector shit.

1354
01:13:09,288 --> 01:13:11,118
I'm starting my own defense practice.

1355
01:13:11,185 --> 01:13:12,470
Start making real money.

1356
01:13:12,505 --> 01:13:16,071
I don't blame you. Best of luck with that.

1357
01:13:16,177 --> 01:13:18,540
And you're leaving us in the
hands of a new prosecutor.

1358
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:19,752
- Yeah.
- Who is he?

1359
01:13:19,787 --> 01:13:20,970
Fred wyshak.

1360
01:13:21,005 --> 01:13:23,224
Fucking bulldog who was
kicking ass down in Jersey,

1361
01:13:23,259 --> 01:13:25,855
but returned to save his hometown.

1362
01:13:25,894 --> 01:13:27,259
Sound familiar?

1363
01:13:28,888 --> 01:13:31,483
- Hey, keep doing what you're doing.
- I will.

1364
01:13:31,518 --> 01:13:33,204
A lot of people are very sad to see you go.

1365
01:13:33,239 --> 01:13:34,839
Thanks for coming, John. Take care.

1366
01:13:34,874 --> 01:13:36,340
You too.

1367
01:13:43,045 --> 01:13:46,177
This is so fucking sick.

1368
01:13:46,354 --> 01:13:48,789
<i>You're sick, Stevie.</i>

1369
01:13:48,929 --> 01:13:50,327
What the fuck was in your mind

1370
01:13:50,362 --> 01:13:53,026
when you decided that
your girlfriend's daughter,

1371
01:13:53,082 --> 01:13:55,494
who happens to call you "daddy,"

1372
01:13:55,529 --> 01:13:58,328
was a good choice to suck your cock?

1373
01:13:58,568 --> 01:13:59,949
Stepdaughter.

1374
01:13:59,997 --> 01:14:02,156
Don't correct me, Stevie.

1375
01:14:02,191 --> 01:14:03,722
Not now.

1376
01:14:04,005 --> 01:14:06,459
And she's a fucking
prostitute, is that correct?

1377
01:14:06,494 --> 01:14:08,206
Jimmy, you know she's a prostitute.

1378
01:14:08,241 --> 01:14:11,224
Do not assume what I do or do not know.

1379
01:14:11,271 --> 01:14:13,059
You answer my fucking question.

1380
01:14:13,094 --> 01:14:15,285
Is she or is she not a prostitute?

1381
01:14:15,341 --> 01:14:17,249
Correct.

1382
01:14:17,375 --> 01:14:20,862
And she's a fucking hopeless
drug addict, as well.

1383
01:14:21,148 --> 01:14:22,537
Huh?

1384
01:14:22,648 --> 01:14:24,215
Little whores on drugs that talk

1385
01:14:24,276 --> 01:14:25,677
don't make me feel any better.

1386
01:14:25,712 --> 01:14:27,038
Hi.

1387
01:14:27,659 --> 01:14:30,728
She may know a few things
she shouldn't have. I'm sorry.

1388
01:14:32,135 --> 01:14:34,764
You fucking better be sorry, pal.

1389
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,751
- Hi!
- How you doin'?

1390
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:45,956
Is this for me?

1391
01:14:46,117 --> 01:14:48,177
Every stitch.

1392
01:14:48,861 --> 01:14:50,847
This is wicked shit!

1393
01:14:51,745 --> 01:14:53,739
Yeah, it is wicked shit.

1394
01:14:53,813 --> 01:14:55,274
So, where are we going?

1395
01:14:55,506 --> 01:14:59,049
Well... not far.

1396
01:14:59,752 --> 01:15:01,698
We found a place where
you could stay a while.

1397
01:15:01,733 --> 01:15:04,188
It's very comfortable, you know.

1398
01:15:04,269 --> 01:15:05,771
Quiet.

1399
01:15:05,897 --> 01:15:07,799
Nobody's gonna bother you.

1400
01:15:07,899 --> 01:15:08,643
Sounds great.

1401
01:15:08,717 --> 01:15:10,866
But before we leave,

1402
01:15:10,901 --> 01:15:14,654
I, uh, I have a few questions.

1403
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:17,489
Sure. What do you want to know?

1404
01:15:17,524 --> 01:15:18,966
What did you just talk about?

1405
01:15:19,054 --> 01:15:20,659
Me?

1406
01:15:20,694 --> 01:15:22,217
Yeah, you.

1407
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:23,627
With who?

1408
01:15:24,666 --> 01:15:27,280
Deborah, sweetheart, you just spent

1409
01:15:27,312 --> 01:15:29,257
the fucking night in the can.

1410
01:15:29,442 --> 01:15:30,389
Yeah.

1411
01:15:30,424 --> 01:15:33,497
Okay, so, where the fuck
did you sleep last night?

1412
01:15:33,656 --> 01:15:36,138
- There.
- And what the fuck is that?

1413
01:15:38,075 --> 01:15:38,903
Police station.

1414
01:15:38,938 --> 01:15:39,977
And who would you be talking to

1415
01:15:40,012 --> 01:15:42,857
in a goddamn police station, Deborah?

1416
01:15:44,151 --> 01:15:46,025
The police?

1417
01:15:46,204 --> 01:15:48,245
Exactly.

1418
01:15:48,785 --> 01:15:51,560
So, what did the police say to you,

1419
01:15:51,756 --> 01:15:54,726
and what did you say back to them?

1420
01:15:55,723 --> 01:15:57,256
Nothing much.

1421
01:15:57,429 --> 01:15:59,006
The usual.

1422
01:15:59,246 --> 01:16:00,443
What is the fucking "usual"?

1423
01:16:00,478 --> 01:16:03,222
I don't know the usual.
What's the fucking usual?

1424
01:16:03,274 --> 01:16:05,931
You know... drugs are bad.
Prostitution's illegal.

1425
01:16:05,966 --> 01:16:07,546
Shit like that.

1426
01:16:08,333 --> 01:16:12,338
And did Stevie and I figure
into this conversation at all?

1427
01:16:13,772 --> 01:16:16,064
They asked if I was involved with you.

1428
01:16:16,139 --> 01:16:17,311
I said no.

1429
01:16:17,346 --> 01:16:20,391
They asked if I was involved
with Stevie, too. I said no.

1430
01:16:21,094 --> 01:16:23,049
That part was actually a lie,

1431
01:16:23,084 --> 01:16:24,158
obviously.

1432
01:16:24,193 --> 01:16:26,009
Obviously.

1433
01:16:26,097 --> 01:16:29,237
So, what did they want to
know about Stevie and I?

1434
01:16:30,019 --> 01:16:32,409
If I'd seen you commit any crimes.

1435
01:16:32,555 --> 01:16:33,649
And drugs.

1436
01:16:33,684 --> 01:16:35,823
They think you're selling a lot of drugs.

1437
01:16:36,010 --> 01:16:37,927
- Do they?
- Yeah.

1438
01:16:38,001 --> 01:16:39,927
And what did you tell them?

1439
01:16:40,027 --> 01:16:41,854
That you didn't.

1440
01:16:41,972 --> 01:16:44,206
That you hang out at triple o's.

1441
01:16:44,336 --> 01:16:46,709
That you was real clean.
Your clothes was real clean.

1442
01:16:46,744 --> 01:16:49,326
You hardly drink any
liquor. You don't do drugs.

1443
01:16:50,029 --> 01:16:50,702
And that you always say,

1444
01:16:50,737 --> 01:16:53,322
"don't believe what you
read in the fucking papers."

1445
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:55,215
That was good, right?

1446
01:16:56,466 --> 01:16:57,854
You said all that?

1447
01:16:58,056 --> 01:16:59,405
Yeah.

1448
01:16:59,437 --> 01:17:01,840
It was good, yeah?

1449
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:03,763
Yeah, you done good.

1450
01:17:03,798 --> 01:17:05,477
Yeah.

1451
01:17:06,023 --> 01:17:07,872
All right, let's head over.

1452
01:17:08,006 --> 01:17:11,193
You know how to get there, Stevie, right?

1453
01:17:25,755 --> 01:17:27,263
Wow!

1454
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:31,373
Oh.

1455
01:17:31,602 --> 01:17:33,232
Oh, my god.

1456
01:17:33,445 --> 01:17:34,850
<i>This is amazing!</i>

1457
01:17:34,912 --> 01:17:37,353
- Yeah, I thought you might like it.
- Yeah.

1458
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:39,319
A big kitchen there, right?

1459
01:17:39,419 --> 01:17:40,761
Fuck.

1460
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:44,289
Wow.

1461
01:17:48,453 --> 01:17:50,678
We'll have some furniture
brought in, you know?

1462
01:17:50,731 --> 01:17:52,233
Super comfy stuff.

1463
01:17:52,268 --> 01:17:55,729
Sure. Oh, my god. It's huge!

1464
01:17:55,764 --> 01:17:56,694
Yeah.

1465
01:17:59,282 --> 01:18:00,809
Wow.

1466
01:18:05,163 --> 01:18:06,304
You know, this was real sweet of you

1467
01:18:06,339 --> 01:18:08,182
to think of me, Jimmy.

1468
01:18:08,566 --> 01:18:09,994
Don't mention it.

1469
01:18:10,167 --> 01:18:12,143
No one's never done nothing
like this for me before.

1470
01:18:12,177 --> 01:18:14,214
Come on, kid. Don't say that.

1471
01:18:14,249 --> 01:18:16,931
You're breaking my fucking heart.

1472
01:18:20,041 --> 01:18:23,176
No, Jimmy! No, please!

1473
01:18:23,211 --> 01:18:24,213
Fuck!

1474
01:18:24,248 --> 01:18:25,671
Jimmy!

1475
01:18:25,756 --> 01:18:27,450
Don't!

1476
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:31,386
Jimmy!

1477
01:18:31,421 --> 01:18:32,672
Please! Please!

1478
01:18:34,612 --> 01:18:36,553
Please, Jimmy!

1479
01:19:08,283 --> 01:19:10,664
Clean up your fucking mess.

1480
01:19:11,643 --> 01:19:13,678
I'm taking a nap.

1481
01:19:13,743 --> 01:19:16,362
We got dinner at connolly's in an hour.

1482
01:19:33,891 --> 01:19:38,803
Mr. flemmi, did you ever see
whitey bulger murder anyone?

1483
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:52,677
I don't know. I thought boggs
had a good game last night.

1484
01:19:52,776 --> 01:19:54,312
He hit well.

1485
01:20:00,741 --> 01:20:02,927
They're not headed here.
Don't worry about it.

1486
01:20:04,479 --> 01:20:05,962
Look great.

1487
01:20:07,993 --> 01:20:10,026
Don't touch them skewers
with your fucking...

1488
01:20:10,182 --> 01:20:11,383
Honey.

1489
01:20:12,284 --> 01:20:13,388
Is the oven on?

1490
01:20:13,423 --> 01:20:14,926
Mm-hmm.

1491
01:20:18,541 --> 01:20:21,162
Could you at least pretend
to be, uh, nice to them,

1492
01:20:21,203 --> 01:20:22,636
play the part?

1493
01:20:22,694 --> 01:20:26,455
John, I'm very uncomfortable here, okay?

1494
01:20:26,490 --> 01:20:27,465
I mean, we've lived with this for years,

1495
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:28,585
but never in my own house.

1496
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:29,639
They can see you.

1497
01:20:29,674 --> 01:20:31,304
<i>I don't give a shit
if they can see me,</i>

1498
01:20:31,339 --> 01:20:33,109
- shh.
- It's my fucking kitchen.

1499
01:20:33,182 --> 01:20:35,265
I mean, you have to be
breaking a rule here, no?

1500
01:20:35,345 --> 01:20:36,996
You can't be socializing with these guys.

1501
01:20:37,031 --> 01:20:39,303
- It's got to be against regulations.
- I am not socializing. I'm...

1502
01:20:39,355 --> 01:20:41,309
What do you call drinking
fucking beers and eating steaks?

1503
01:20:41,383 --> 01:20:43,763
I'm maintaining my
relationship with my informant.

1504
01:20:43,811 --> 01:20:45,146
- Ha!
- That r... yeah.

1505
01:20:45,181 --> 01:20:46,796
<i>That relationship is
the prime reason</i>

1506
01:20:46,831 --> 01:20:48,234
I keep getting promoted, which is why

1507
01:20:48,315 --> 01:20:50,627
we live in this fancy house
and you drive that brand-new car

1508
01:20:50,662 --> 01:20:52,337
- that you so desperately wanted.
- That's how you want to play this, John?

1509
01:20:52,372 --> 01:20:54,127
That's how you want to play this, huh?

1510
01:20:54,162 --> 01:20:55,443
- You keep your voice down.
- You know... fuck you.

1511
01:20:55,478 --> 01:20:56,856
Fuck you, keep my voice down.

1512
01:20:56,891 --> 01:20:58,076
This is my kitchen.

1513
01:20:58,111 --> 01:20:59,628
<i>It's your kitchen.</i>

1514
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:03,601
Don't even fucking start with that, okay?

1515
01:21:04,055 --> 01:21:04,751
I'll be in our room.

1516
01:21:04,786 --> 01:21:06,634
I'll... I'll be in our
room with the door locked.

1517
01:21:06,669 --> 01:21:07,753
- It's... it's... it's a...
- Shut up.

1518
01:21:07,785 --> 01:21:09,635
Yeah, fuck.

1519
01:21:20,365 --> 01:21:21,485
Stevie, what's the matter with you?

1520
01:21:21,532 --> 01:21:24,369
You're quiet tonight, huh?

1521
01:21:24,708 --> 01:21:27,695
You got a problem with people
keeping their mouths shut?

1522
01:21:28,406 --> 01:21:30,943
I'm breaking your balls. Hmm?

1523
01:21:32,604 --> 01:21:35,245
Do yourself a favor... don't.

1524
01:21:36,118 --> 01:21:40,240
So, uh, guys.

1525
01:21:40,376 --> 01:21:44,994
Uh, I... I hate to bring this
up at a... at a social dinner,

1526
01:21:45,029 --> 01:21:48,290
but there's this detective in Florida

1527
01:21:48,325 --> 01:21:50,274
that keeps calling us about Callahan.

1528
01:21:50,345 --> 01:21:52,644
Asking questions, and, uh...

1529
01:21:52,679 --> 01:21:54,766
Well, h-h-he just
won't leave it alone,

1530
01:21:54,799 --> 01:21:56,549
and I have to handle it.

1531
01:21:56,681 --> 01:21:58,383
Then handle it.

1532
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,136
Well, handle it.

1533
01:22:02,171 --> 01:22:05,175
Well... yeah.

1534
01:22:07,898 --> 01:22:09,972
And Morris...

1535
01:22:11,021 --> 01:22:14,358
You and I got to have
a little sit-down here.

1536
01:22:17,164 --> 01:22:21,507
What the fuck did you
marinate this steak in?

1537
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:23,168
Because it's out of this world.

1538
01:22:23,203 --> 01:22:24,704
You're killing me with it.

1539
01:22:24,739 --> 01:22:26,775
Now, now, now.

1540
01:22:27,121 --> 01:22:29,641
It's a family secret. Hmm?

1541
01:22:29,939 --> 01:22:32,400
Come on.

1542
01:22:32,501 --> 01:22:33,805
Aw.

1543
01:22:33,936 --> 01:22:35,927
That is one of the best goddamn steaks

1544
01:22:35,962 --> 01:22:38,065
- I ever had in my life.
- Mm-hmm.

1545
01:22:38,142 --> 01:22:39,377
Ever.

1546
01:22:43,181 --> 01:22:45,750
I got a knife over here.

1547
01:22:45,834 --> 01:22:47,572
Oh, come on. Come on.

1548
01:22:47,635 --> 01:22:49,290
What's... what's the...
What's the family...

1549
01:22:49,350 --> 01:22:51,111
What's the family's secret recipe?

1550
01:22:51,146 --> 01:22:53,421
It's g... it's ground garlic

1551
01:22:53,473 --> 01:22:55,997
and a little bit of soy.

1552
01:22:56,045 --> 01:22:59,016
- That's it?
- Yeah, that's it. That's it.

1553
01:23:06,716 --> 01:23:09,520
I thought it was a family secret.

1554
01:23:12,451 --> 01:23:14,794
It's a recipe.

1555
01:23:14,848 --> 01:23:16,399
No.

1556
01:23:17,554 --> 01:23:19,002
No.

1557
01:23:19,857 --> 01:23:22,612
You said to me this is a family secret,

1558
01:23:22,647 --> 01:23:25,618
and you gave it up to me, boom.

1559
01:23:25,722 --> 01:23:29,159
Just fucking like that.

1560
01:23:29,773 --> 01:23:30,740
Don't look to John

1561
01:23:30,788 --> 01:23:33,172
'cause he's not gonna fucking help you.

1562
01:23:38,436 --> 01:23:41,940
You spill the secret family recipe today,

1563
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:44,450
maybe you fucking spill about me tomorrow.

1564
01:23:44,485 --> 01:23:47,309
Is that something, maybe,
that's a possibility?

1565
01:23:47,344 --> 01:23:48,318
I was just saying...

1566
01:23:48,353 --> 01:23:50,189
You were "just saying"?

1567
01:23:50,315 --> 01:23:54,152
"Just saying" gets
people sent to allenwood.

1568
01:23:54,218 --> 01:23:57,724
"Just saying" got me a nine-year stretch

1569
01:23:57,759 --> 01:23:59,712
in leavenworth and Alcatraz.

1570
01:23:59,747 --> 01:24:01,224
You understand?

1571
01:24:01,259 --> 01:24:04,979
So, "just saying"...

1572
01:24:06,163 --> 01:24:10,001
Could get you buried real fucking quick.

1573
01:24:27,864 --> 01:24:30,053
Look at his fucking face!

1574
01:24:30,088 --> 01:24:32,858
Hey! I'm fucking with you.

1575
01:24:32,891 --> 01:24:34,223
Hey, I'm fucking with you.

1576
01:24:34,258 --> 01:24:36,459
It's a recipe. Couldn't give a shit.

1577
01:24:36,510 --> 01:24:39,398
Tastes great. I'm fucking with you.

1578
01:24:40,139 --> 01:24:41,652
All right.

1579
01:24:41,687 --> 01:24:44,656
You got... well, you... you got me, too.

1580
01:24:45,570 --> 01:24:48,237
Listen, I... I want to...
I want to make a toast.

1581
01:24:49,587 --> 01:24:51,256
To success.

1582
01:24:52,735 --> 01:24:54,971
Just getting started.

1583
01:25:01,964 --> 01:25:05,330
Mm. Where's the wife?

1584
01:25:05,564 --> 01:25:07,318
She's, uh... she's resting.

1585
01:25:07,353 --> 01:25:09,689
She's... she's a little under the weather.

1586
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:14,223
Didn't... didn't I just see her?

1587
01:25:14,454 --> 01:25:15,700
Yeah, she was helping.

1588
01:25:15,765 --> 01:25:19,252
She, uh... well, sh... sh...
She's not feeling very good.

1589
01:25:19,406 --> 01:25:20,693
Oh, gee.

1590
01:25:20,767 --> 01:25:22,126
Like a...

1591
01:25:22,253 --> 01:25:24,504
You know what? I'll go have a look at her.

1592
01:25:24,611 --> 01:25:25,819
Jimmy. Jimmy.

1593
01:25:25,854 --> 01:25:27,337
She's sick. She's fi... she's fi...

1594
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:28,937
Listen... fine.

1595
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:50,711
Oh.

1596
01:25:50,746 --> 01:25:53,150
Hi. I thought you were John.

1597
01:25:53,812 --> 01:25:56,279
No, it ain't John.

1598
01:25:56,340 --> 01:25:59,489
Come on. Come down and join us.

1599
01:25:59,535 --> 01:26:01,981
No, I'm not feeling
well. Thank you, though.

1600
01:26:02,716 --> 01:26:04,251
Marianne, you know what you're doing?

1601
01:26:04,286 --> 01:26:06,986
You're embarrassing your
husband in front of his friends,

1602
01:26:07,034 --> 01:26:08,370
that's what you're doing.

1603
01:26:08,451 --> 01:26:11,121
And you know that's what you're doing.

1604
01:26:11,585 --> 01:26:14,737
I don't know what John told
you, but I'm feeling ill.

1605
01:26:16,557 --> 01:26:18,096
That's all.

1606
01:26:18,263 --> 01:26:20,223
Please, no offense.

1607
01:26:22,998 --> 01:26:25,443
Well, let's see what you got.

1608
01:26:25,895 --> 01:26:27,721
Um...

1609
01:26:28,995 --> 01:26:30,672
Yeah.

1610
01:26:33,576 --> 01:26:35,605
Well...

1611
01:26:36,364 --> 01:26:39,095
You don't feel warm.

1612
01:26:40,796 --> 01:26:42,862
Got any chills?

1613
01:26:43,786 --> 01:26:45,334
'Cause normally, you get the chills

1614
01:26:45,369 --> 01:26:47,967
before the flu comes on, you know?

1615
01:26:51,688 --> 01:26:53,791
Any soreness there?

1616
01:26:55,965 --> 01:26:59,895
What are you feeling
there? You feel something?

1617
01:27:01,718 --> 01:27:05,447
'Cause I don't feel any
swollen glands there.

1618
01:27:07,097 --> 01:27:13,292
But, you know, me, i
had to learn the hard way

1619
01:27:14,318 --> 01:27:17,247
not to take chances
with this kind of thing.

1620
01:27:17,308 --> 01:27:19,577
You know what I'm saying?

1621
01:27:21,263 --> 01:27:23,309
Poor little thing.

1622
01:27:24,388 --> 01:27:26,397
You get some rest.

1623
01:27:26,557 --> 01:27:28,882
Wouldn't want nothing to happen to you.

1624
01:27:38,969 --> 01:27:41,404
John's a lucky man.

1625
01:28:13,114 --> 01:28:14,395
Jimmy?

1626
01:28:15,842 --> 01:28:18,136
I'll get it there safe and sound.

1627
01:28:18,483 --> 01:28:20,314
You can sleep on it.

1628
01:28:20,424 --> 01:28:22,384
I know you will, mcintyre.

1629
01:28:22,456 --> 01:28:24,388
Have safe travels, huh?

1630
01:28:24,944 --> 01:28:26,653
All right.

1631
01:28:26,688 --> 01:28:27,363
Stevie.

1632
01:28:27,398 --> 01:28:29,355
Take care of it, John.

1633
01:28:29,901 --> 01:28:31,785
Weeksy, give me a call.

1634
01:28:31,905 --> 01:28:34,223
Thanks for everything,
Jimmy. We won't forget it.

1635
01:28:34,258 --> 01:28:35,736
For me, it's an honor.

1636
01:28:35,824 --> 01:28:37,425
The honor's ours.

1637
01:28:37,735 --> 01:28:39,173
Thanks, pal.

1638
01:28:51,029 --> 01:28:54,051
_

1639
01:28:55,881 --> 01:28:57,789
hope I'm not interrupting.

1640
01:28:57,821 --> 01:28:59,675
Special agent John connolly.

1641
01:28:59,710 --> 01:29:01,343
I know who you are. I've
heard a lot about you.

1642
01:29:01,378 --> 01:29:03,399
Oh, good things, I hope.

1643
01:29:03,494 --> 01:29:06,032
Listen, little welcome
wagon present for you.

1644
01:29:06,126 --> 01:29:08,062
- Big game.
- I'm good.

1645
01:29:08,097 --> 01:29:10,435
Are you sure about that?
Clemens is on the mound tonight.

1646
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:12,015
I'm sure about that.

1647
01:29:12,050 --> 01:29:13,553
All right.

1648
01:29:13,670 --> 01:29:15,234
Work, work, work.

1649
01:29:15,315 --> 01:29:17,251
Well, listen, after... after you finish,

1650
01:29:17,286 --> 01:29:19,273
come down to
the bell-in-hand.

1651
01:29:19,343 --> 01:29:21,207
I would like to buy you a pint,

1652
01:29:21,242 --> 01:29:23,749
and you can meet some of the other agents.

1653
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:28,614
Do you have a case for me, agent connolly?

1654
01:29:28,649 --> 01:29:31,388
No, I just came to I... introduce myself.

1655
01:29:31,423 --> 01:29:33,869
You know, couple of local
boys moving up the ranks.

1656
01:29:33,924 --> 01:29:37,002
Maybe we can help each other along. Yeah.

1657
01:29:37,064 --> 01:29:40,026
Bring me cases, that's all the help I need.

1658
01:29:40,797 --> 01:29:42,178
All right.

1659
01:29:43,826 --> 01:29:46,678
All right, well, I'll
leave you to it, then.

1660
01:29:46,815 --> 01:29:48,244
Hey, you know, since you're here.

1661
01:29:48,279 --> 01:29:49,551
Yeah?

1662
01:29:49,966 --> 01:29:52,018
How come no one has nailed whitey bulger?

1663
01:29:52,053 --> 01:29:53,982
Oh, no. No, no, no.

1664
01:29:54,017 --> 01:29:56,400
That won't work. I wouldn't
do that if I were you.

1665
01:29:56,435 --> 01:29:58,616
- Excuse me?
- Now, what's bulger done?

1666
01:29:58,685 --> 01:30:03,598
He's a smalltime hood, but he...
He... he's an invaluable asset.

1667
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:06,195
What's he done?

1668
01:30:06,263 --> 01:30:08,537
Everything, evidently.

1669
01:30:08,572 --> 01:30:11,585
Drugs, extortion, murder.

1670
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:12,443
I'd heard rumors,

1671
01:30:12,498 --> 01:30:14,771
but these other informant
reports make it clear.

1672
01:30:14,806 --> 01:30:15,592
And he... here's the thing...

1673
01:30:15,627 --> 01:30:18,590
Every time we start a
formal investigation, poof!

1674
01:30:18,730 --> 01:30:20,945
Goes away. He slips free.

1675
01:30:21,205 --> 01:30:23,246
How do you account for that?

1676
01:30:23,370 --> 01:30:24,662
I don't know.

1677
01:30:25,297 --> 01:30:27,962
Luck of the Irish?

1678
01:30:28,082 --> 01:30:29,957
"Luck of the Irish"? That's
what you're going with?

1679
01:30:29,992 --> 01:30:32,061
Well, it's...

1680
01:30:33,702 --> 01:30:36,124
...it's slandering lies

1681
01:30:36,159 --> 01:30:38,562
from his brother Billy's
political opponents.

1682
01:30:38,597 --> 01:30:40,608
These fucking assholes from Cambridge,

1683
01:30:40,643 --> 01:30:42,486
they will do anything to bring Billy down

1684
01:30:42,521 --> 01:30:44,123
because they can't stand

1685
01:30:44,158 --> 01:30:46,591
power in the hands of a Mick from southie.

1686
01:30:46,626 --> 01:30:47,649
You don't think Billy's protecting

1687
01:30:47,684 --> 01:30:49,103
his older brother, just maybe?

1688
01:30:49,138 --> 01:30:50,780
No! No way.

1689
01:30:50,863 --> 01:30:52,370
Really?

1690
01:30:52,701 --> 01:30:53,501
Well, it seems to me

1691
01:30:53,536 --> 01:30:55,049
you'd have to believe
in fucking leprechauns

1692
01:30:55,117 --> 01:30:58,195
to think we have the
biggest crime lord in Boston

1693
01:30:58,341 --> 01:31:00,778
and be brothers with the
most powerful politician

1694
01:31:00,813 --> 01:31:04,479
<i>in the state and them not
be helping each other out.</i>

1695
01:31:04,514 --> 01:31:07,622
I grew up with Billy, southie.

1696
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:10,661
<i>So, I know him, I know that he knows</i>

1697
01:31:10,696 --> 01:31:11,616
that it would be crazy

1698
01:31:11,651 --> 01:31:14,487
for him to get mixed up in
anything that Jimmy does.

1699
01:31:14,564 --> 01:31:17,515
It's, you know... too brazen.

1700
01:31:17,628 --> 01:31:19,397
I'll ask you again...

1701
01:31:19,437 --> 01:31:22,199
How come no one has done whitey bulger?

1702
01:31:22,295 --> 01:31:24,968
He seems to be involved
in every crime in the city

1703
01:31:25,003 --> 01:31:27,143
and yet the bureau keeps saying he's clean.

1704
01:31:27,191 --> 01:31:29,524
<i>It's only when another
agency has an informant</i>

1705
01:31:29,559 --> 01:31:32,377
<i>that I hear maybe
whitey isn't so squeaky clean.</i>

1706
01:31:34,611 --> 01:31:35,986
Well, I hear that he's very careful,

1707
01:31:36,021 --> 01:31:40,025
he doesn't use phones...
That kind of stuff, and, uh...

1708
01:31:40,504 --> 01:31:43,580
Who did you say these
other informants were?

1709
01:31:43,996 --> 01:31:45,628
I didn't.

1710
01:31:48,101 --> 01:31:50,281
Listen, from what I hear,

1711
01:31:50,394 --> 01:31:52,278
his criminal days are all but over.

1712
01:31:52,313 --> 01:31:54,689
His... his partner and
him, they gone legit...

1713
01:31:54,724 --> 01:31:56,864
Christ, connolly, you fucking with me?!

1714
01:31:56,899 --> 01:31:58,932
Is whitey never using phones and careful,

1715
01:31:58,967 --> 01:32:00,746
or is whitey retired?!

1716
01:32:00,793 --> 01:32:02,161
I don't...

1717
01:32:03,246 --> 01:32:05,344
I mean, I just... I'm not in my office...

1718
01:32:05,379 --> 01:32:06,648
These are things that I hear,

1719
01:32:06,683 --> 01:32:08,120
I don't know if all of them are true.

1720
01:32:08,155 --> 01:32:10,662
Do your job and find out!

1721
01:32:13,777 --> 01:32:16,346
I am. I am. I... I wa...

1722
01:32:17,303 --> 01:32:20,813
You know that I wouldn't come
here if it wasn't serious,

1723
01:32:20,964 --> 01:32:22,412
if there was anywhere else I could turn,

1724
01:32:22,447 --> 01:32:24,417
and I know that the last thing you need

1725
01:32:24,452 --> 01:32:27,616
is to have Jimmy's business
crossing paths with yours.

1726
01:32:27,651 --> 01:32:29,579
Well, your grasp of the
situation is so keen,

1727
01:32:29,614 --> 01:32:31,280
it makes me wonder what you're doing here.

1728
01:32:31,315 --> 01:32:35,929
This new guy, wyshak, has
a serious hard-on for Jimmy.

1729
01:32:35,964 --> 01:32:37,776
And that can't be good for any of us.

1730
01:32:37,839 --> 01:32:39,243
And you're telling me this why?

1731
01:32:39,309 --> 01:32:41,364
Maybe you can influence him.

1732
01:32:41,399 --> 01:32:42,567
Just make him listen to reason!

1733
01:32:42,602 --> 01:32:44,388
I'm not kissing your ass, Billy,

1734
01:32:44,429 --> 01:32:46,901
but you are the most
powerful man in the city.

1735
01:32:46,936 --> 01:32:48,673
Not that I would, but wyshak's federal,

1736
01:32:48,721 --> 01:32:50,321
and I'm state, and you know that.

1737
01:32:50,356 --> 01:32:54,826
But where we come from, I know and you know

1738
01:32:54,861 --> 01:32:58,459
that what is written on a piece of paper

1739
01:32:58,591 --> 01:33:04,674
is less important than
blood and honor and loyalty.

1740
01:33:08,376 --> 01:33:10,732
I'm not asking you to help me.

1741
01:33:11,487 --> 01:33:13,990
I'm asking you to help your brother.

1742
01:33:16,425 --> 01:33:19,000
That's the same thing now, isn't it?

1743
01:33:30,459 --> 01:33:37,890
Billy, wyshak is asking
questions about you, too.

1744
01:33:40,622 --> 01:33:42,184
Oh.

1745
01:33:48,826 --> 01:33:51,984
John, you know I have the
utmost respect for you.

1746
01:33:52,019 --> 01:33:55,983
Really, I do, which is why i
can tell you with all my heart

1747
01:33:56,154 --> 01:33:58,233
that if you ever come into my office again

1748
01:33:58,288 --> 01:34:00,201
with a fucked-up idea like that

1749
01:34:00,236 --> 01:34:03,943
you'll rue the day you ever
thought of joining the FBI.

1750
01:34:09,326 --> 01:34:11,196
Jeannie will show you out.

1751
01:34:20,131 --> 01:34:21,379
This report has information

1752
01:34:21,414 --> 01:34:25,526
attributed to our prized
informant whitey bulger.

1753
01:34:28,668 --> 01:34:30,953
And this is the same piece of information

1754
01:34:30,988 --> 01:34:33,124
from one of our other informants

1755
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:34,818
dated four weeks earlier.

1756
01:34:34,852 --> 01:34:38,738
_

1757
01:34:38,773 --> 01:34:40,320
this is information credited to

1758
01:34:40,355 --> 01:34:44,449
our supposedly prized
informant James "whitey" bulger.

1759
01:34:47,605 --> 01:34:50,121
- And the same piece of information
- _

1760
01:34:50,156 --> 01:34:54,450
dated six weeks earlier,
different informant.

1761
01:34:54,802 --> 01:34:56,211
_

1762
01:34:56,246 --> 01:34:58,232
in fact, if you take a
look at bulger's pile,

1763
01:34:58,297 --> 01:34:59,906
you'll find the same situation played out

1764
01:34:59,967 --> 01:35:01,924
time and again from other sources.

1765
01:35:01,999 --> 01:35:08,515
In fact, you'll find very little
from bulger that means shit.

1766
01:35:14,404 --> 01:35:17,366
<i>Customs officials in Boston
say they have seized a trawler</i>

1767
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:20,356
<i>used to smuggle weapons
to Irish terrorists.</i>

1768
01:35:20,391 --> 01:35:23,162
<i>Agents say the trawler ferried
a load of arms and ammunition</i>

1769
01:35:23,197 --> 01:35:25,396
<i>- to the Irish coast last week.
- Jesus fucking Christ.</i>

1770
01:35:25,431 --> 01:35:27,977
<i>The weapons were intercepted
by the Irish Navy</i>

1771
01:35:28,012 --> 01:35:30,568
<i>after they had been
transferred to a smaller ship.</i>

1772
01:35:30,619 --> 01:35:33,432
<i>- Officials say they have seized the ship's log and other doc...
- Motherfucker.</i>

1773
01:35:33,804 --> 01:35:35,572
Northern Ireland?

1774
01:35:35,652 --> 01:35:36,887
Yeah.

1775
01:35:39,234 --> 01:35:41,009
Well, how did they know about the ship?

1776
01:35:41,044 --> 01:35:43,802
The pilot. Turns out he's
also a snitch for d.E.A.

1777
01:35:43,869 --> 01:35:45,462
Customs, too.

1778
01:35:46,836 --> 01:35:48,558
What's his name?

1779
01:35:48,768 --> 01:35:50,419
- I don't know.
- How do you not know?

1780
01:35:50,454 --> 01:35:53,516
I... don't know, John.

1781
01:35:56,544 --> 01:36:00,081
All right, well, where is
this guy now, the pilot?

1782
01:36:00,177 --> 01:36:02,780
- I want to talk to him.
- Oh, no can do.

1783
01:36:02,843 --> 01:36:05,249
What do you mean, "no can do"? Yes, can do.

1784
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:07,064
Sorry, he belongs to d.E.A.

1785
01:36:07,099 --> 01:36:09,086
Well... okay.

1786
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:12,442
You ask permission for us to talk to him.

1787
01:36:12,490 --> 01:36:14,564
- I did.
- And?

1788
01:36:14,629 --> 01:36:17,199
It's not gonna happen, John.

1789
01:36:45,263 --> 01:36:46,890
I don't like that guy, though.

1790
01:36:46,925 --> 01:36:49,082
He's got a big fucking mouth.

1791
01:36:51,004 --> 01:36:52,207
Yeah, take a right here.

1792
01:36:52,282 --> 01:36:53,718
Yeah? All right.

1793
01:36:53,942 --> 01:36:55,431
All right, I got it.

1794
01:36:57,873 --> 01:37:00,476
Weeksy, what's up?

1795
01:37:02,814 --> 01:37:05,701
Where is everybody? I thought
it was a fucking party.

1796
01:37:06,825 --> 01:37:08,879
Bulger's playing us, Nick.

1797
01:37:08,965 --> 01:37:10,452
Making a fool of the bureau,

1798
01:37:10,487 --> 01:37:12,030
hiding behind his informant status

1799
01:37:12,085 --> 01:37:14,364
to run roughshod over my city.

1800
01:37:14,399 --> 01:37:16,253
Using us to cover for him.

1801
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:17,492
I won't stand for it.

1802
01:37:17,527 --> 01:37:18,893
And I am distressed about that,

1803
01:37:18,948 --> 01:37:19,939
but from where I sit,

1804
01:37:19,974 --> 01:37:22,516
we have bigger priorities to consider.

1805
01:37:22,570 --> 01:37:23,881
So, you're telling me to do nothing.

1806
01:37:23,929 --> 01:37:26,130
No, not at all.

1807
01:37:26,277 --> 01:37:28,040
I'm telling you we can't taint

1808
01:37:28,075 --> 01:37:30,422
one of the most successful
rico prosecutions

1809
01:37:30,457 --> 01:37:31,445
in the history of the bureau

1810
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:36,137
just to get whitey
bulger, psychopath or not.

1811
01:37:36,997 --> 01:37:37,883
But we have no objection

1812
01:37:37,918 --> 01:37:40,440
to your going after
the agents handling him.

1813
01:37:42,746 --> 01:37:45,313
Can't you see what's happening?

1814
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:47,648
The vise is closing on us.

1815
01:37:48,582 --> 01:37:50,328
Listen to me.

1816
01:37:50,569 --> 01:37:53,123
Did you know it was Hampton and Dawson

1817
01:37:53,158 --> 01:37:55,892
that hit that national bank on exeter?

1818
01:37:55,939 --> 01:38:00,223
No, and neither did I,
until whitey bulger told us.

1819
01:38:00,275 --> 01:38:01,556
Whitey didn't tell us that.

1820
01:38:01,591 --> 01:38:03,579
Yes, he did.

1821
01:38:03,734 --> 01:38:08,148
Nick McVeigh is running speed
to high schools in Newton.

1822
01:38:08,196 --> 01:38:11,188
High school kids, for fuck's sake.

1823
01:38:11,442 --> 01:38:12,907
Thank god for whitey bulger.

1824
01:38:12,942 --> 01:38:15,172
- Thank god for whitey bulger.
- You hear me?

1825
01:38:15,220 --> 01:38:18,932
Whitey introduced dope
to every kid in southie.

1826
01:38:18,980 --> 01:38:22,425
12- and 13-year-old
girls, John.

1827
01:38:22,868 --> 01:38:24,307
What about halloran?

1828
01:38:24,342 --> 01:38:25,750
And Callahan, huh?

1829
01:38:25,795 --> 01:38:27,857
Douchebags who got what was coming to them.

1830
01:38:27,892 --> 01:38:29,804
It's not our fault.

1831
01:38:29,839 --> 01:38:31,261
It's not our fault?

1832
01:38:31,326 --> 01:38:33,461
- Whose fault is it?
- Not ours.

1833
01:38:33,516 --> 01:38:36,006
That's gonna sound great in court.

1834
01:38:37,290 --> 01:38:38,792
Mcguire is gonna go to Washington.

1835
01:38:38,862 --> 01:38:40,577
You know that, right?

1836
01:38:41,491 --> 01:38:43,596
And he's gonna bring
all the informant files.

1837
01:38:43,691 --> 01:38:48,249
And wyshak is dead set on
hanging our asses on his wall.

1838
01:38:48,328 --> 01:38:50,291
We are fucked, John.

1839
01:38:50,349 --> 01:38:52,319
- We are fucked.
- Listen to me.

1840
01:38:52,386 --> 01:38:54,352
The bureau wants results.

1841
01:38:54,430 --> 01:38:55,753
We gave them results.

1842
01:38:55,788 --> 01:38:58,771
We drove a stake through
the black heart of the mafia.

1843
01:38:58,806 --> 01:39:01,445
Everything else is gonna be a sideshow.

1844
01:39:01,499 --> 01:39:02,690
Now we're stuck with whitey,

1845
01:39:02,725 --> 01:39:05,306
and without the Italians,
nobody can rein him in,

1846
01:39:05,341 --> 01:39:07,144
and we can't even pull on his chain

1847
01:39:07,179 --> 01:39:08,781
because we're in too deep!

1848
01:39:08,865 --> 01:39:10,232
And he knows it!

1849
01:39:10,267 --> 01:39:13,385
You understand what I'm
saying about a vise?!

1850
01:39:18,248 --> 01:39:20,476
I thought I was doing good.

1851
01:39:21,157 --> 01:39:23,177
I actually thought i
could make a difference.

1852
01:39:23,212 --> 01:39:24,476
We made a difference.

1853
01:39:24,511 --> 01:39:26,573
We put the mafia out of business.

1854
01:39:26,665 --> 01:39:29,754
If that ain't good, I don't know what is.

1855
01:39:30,470 --> 01:39:31,507
Yeah.

1856
01:39:33,437 --> 01:39:35,367
And you know what we're doing now, John?

1857
01:39:35,505 --> 01:39:37,842
Digging our own fucking graves.

1858
01:40:00,916 --> 01:40:02,591
God damn it.

1859
01:40:08,966 --> 01:40:10,753
Marianne!

1860
01:40:13,647 --> 01:40:16,860
Marianne, don't do this!

1861
01:40:19,795 --> 01:40:23,084
Marianne, are you fucking kidding me?!

1862
01:40:33,488 --> 01:40:34,978
This informant has been a minor player

1863
01:40:35,013 --> 01:40:38,109
in the Boston crime syndicate
since he was a teenager.

1864
01:40:38,189 --> 01:40:40,101
- So you checked his house?
- Yes.

1865
01:40:40,149 --> 01:40:41,751
- And work?
- Mm-hmm.

1866
01:40:41,825 --> 01:40:43,750
And he's never missed an
informant meeting before?

1867
01:40:43,817 --> 01:40:45,628
None I'm aware of. Yeah?

1868
01:40:45,663 --> 01:40:46,886
No, nothing.

1869
01:40:48,168 --> 01:40:50,066
- You want to see me?
- Yeah, I want to see you!

1870
01:40:50,147 --> 01:40:51,302
Mcintyre has vanished

1871
01:40:51,348 --> 01:40:53,198
off the face of the fucking earth.

1872
01:40:53,249 --> 01:40:54,382
Which seems to be a common phenomenon

1873
01:40:54,450 --> 01:40:56,152
for any informant that
says something incriminating

1874
01:40:56,187 --> 01:40:57,824
against whitey bulger.

1875
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:02,446
You got nothing to say, connolly?

1876
01:41:02,843 --> 01:41:04,413
You see these gentlemen here?

1877
01:41:04,697 --> 01:41:06,686
They're gonna help me get this cocksucker.

1878
01:41:06,761 --> 01:41:09,857
If we have to arrest every
lowlife in Boston to do that,

1879
01:41:09,892 --> 01:41:11,793
we'll arrest them... every loan shark,

1880
01:41:11,828 --> 01:41:13,739
every bookie, every drug dealer.

1881
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:16,446
One of those guys is gonna
make a case against him.

1882
01:41:17,446 --> 01:41:19,741
Of all fucking people...

1883
01:41:22,172 --> 01:41:23,471
...you.

1884
01:41:32,989 --> 01:41:34,416
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

1885
01:41:34,451 --> 01:41:37,672
You've always been fucking
weak, John, since we was kids.

1886
01:41:37,707 --> 01:41:38,991
What'd you tell them?

1887
01:41:39,026 --> 01:41:42,960
I don't want to fucking
die. Oh, god, Jimmy!

1888
01:41:43,051 --> 01:41:45,825
I need to know exactly
who you fucking talked to,

1889
01:41:45,860 --> 01:41:48,163
and exactly what you said.

1890
01:41:48,258 --> 01:41:51,428
A d.E.A. Agent by the name of brown.

1891
01:41:51,463 --> 01:41:52,824
I told him everything...

1892
01:41:52,859 --> 01:41:55,885
The I.R.A., Cahill, the whole bit!

1893
01:41:55,984 --> 01:41:59,599
I know I shouldn't have,
Jimmy, but I had no choice!

1894
01:42:02,444 --> 01:42:04,142
Fuck you.

1895
01:42:05,135 --> 01:42:07,413
You always have a choice.

1896
01:42:07,544 --> 01:42:10,209
You just happened to make
the wrong fucking one.

1897
01:42:13,434 --> 01:42:15,069
Look at me.

1898
01:42:17,330 --> 01:42:19,780
I said fucking look at me.

1899
01:42:21,217 --> 01:42:23,421
I known you a long time.

1900
01:42:24,367 --> 01:42:27,370
And for you to fuck me like this...

1901
01:42:29,744 --> 01:42:31,980
...fucking hurts.

1902
01:42:35,152 --> 01:42:38,642
So I'm gonna fucking bury you right here

1903
01:42:38,682 --> 01:42:41,244
where all the other weak
people have been buried.

1904
01:42:41,279 --> 01:42:42,570
Jimmy, I'm sorry!

1905
01:42:42,605 --> 01:42:45,139
But you'll be dead before
Stevie pulls your teeth,

1906
01:42:45,194 --> 01:42:47,077
which is more than you fucking deserve,

1907
01:42:47,150 --> 01:42:48,498
- I'll tell you that.
- Jimmy, I'm sorry! Jimmy, I'm sorry!

1908
01:42:48,533 --> 01:42:50,769
Jimmy, I'm sorry! Oh, god, Jimmy, I'm...

1909
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:18,181
Take out his fucking teeth.

1910
01:43:18,242 --> 01:43:20,634
Bury him next to the whore.

1911
01:43:46,388 --> 01:43:48,712
Special agent John Morris, FBI.

<i>Gerard O'Neill, Boston globe.</i>

1913
01:43:51,347 --> 01:43:53,151
Dick lehr, same.

1914
01:43:53,186 --> 01:43:55,645
Thank you for meeting with us.

1915
01:43:56,318 --> 01:43:58,390
I feel like, uh...

1916
01:44:01,459 --> 01:44:03,566
Like I should be in a confessional.

1917
01:44:04,053 --> 01:44:06,971
It's the right thing to do, John.

1918
01:44:09,716 --> 01:44:12,246
Anything I tell you has
to be off the record.

1919
01:44:12,281 --> 01:44:14,102
- You understand?
- Of course.

1920
01:44:14,137 --> 01:44:17,989
We'll develop our own sources,
corroborate everything.

1921
01:44:21,677 --> 01:44:23,370
Where do I start?

1922
01:44:29,371 --> 01:44:31,128
- What do you know?
- All of it.

1923
01:44:31,163 --> 01:44:32,423
We know.

1924
01:44:32,455 --> 01:44:33,630
And you're running it?

1925
01:44:33,665 --> 01:44:35,535
We wouldn't be here if we weren't.

1926
01:44:57,801 --> 01:45:00,930
_

1927
01:45:21,411 --> 01:45:22,479
what?

1928
01:45:25,354 --> 01:45:26,832
What is it, Jim?

1929
01:45:42,675 --> 01:45:44,770
What the fuck, Jim?

1930
01:45:48,023 --> 01:45:50,100
What the fuck? This is bullshit.

1931
01:45:52,967 --> 01:45:54,457
Right? This isn't true.

1932
01:45:54,605 --> 01:45:57,844
Right?

1933
01:45:58,793 --> 01:46:02,618
Kevin, you're gonna hear

1934
01:46:02,908 --> 01:46:04,265
and you're gonna fucking read

1935
01:46:04,300 --> 01:46:07,010
a lot of bullshit about me...

1936
01:46:07,078 --> 01:46:09,414
A lot of nasty things.

1937
01:46:09,651 --> 01:46:13,617
And most of it, if not all
of it, is fucking untrue.

1938
01:46:13,652 --> 01:46:15,824
It's pure fiction.

1939
01:46:16,359 --> 01:46:18,229
You know me.

1940
01:46:19,250 --> 01:46:20,897
And you know these people.

1941
01:46:20,952 --> 01:46:23,707
You know these fucking people.

1942
01:46:23,748 --> 01:46:25,683
They're liars.

1943
01:46:27,837 --> 01:46:30,602
They know no fucking code of honor.

1944
01:46:33,812 --> 01:46:37,085
How many envelopes of fucking cash

1945
01:46:37,120 --> 01:46:40,270
did you deliver to these feds?

1946
01:46:40,305 --> 01:46:44,165
How many cases of wine
for that prick Morris?

1947
01:46:44,207 --> 01:46:46,008
Or fucking vacations,

1948
01:46:46,048 --> 01:46:50,626
or, uh, fucking money,
money, money, fuck it.

1949
01:46:57,285 --> 01:47:00,385
Does that sound like
what an informant does?

1950
01:47:02,234 --> 01:47:04,293
Guy ran a sports and numbers racket

1951
01:47:04,348 --> 01:47:07,543
out of Heller's cafe,
parlayed it into loan sharking,

1952
01:47:07,578 --> 01:47:10,003
and that into money laundering.

1953
01:47:10,105 --> 01:47:12,318
Says he can give us some big fish.

1954
01:47:12,431 --> 01:47:13,562
Evidence?

1955
01:47:13,610 --> 01:47:15,357
Pictures and sound.

1956
01:47:15,967 --> 01:47:17,603
FBI know anything about this?

1957
01:47:17,638 --> 01:47:19,322
No, but I can call them if you want.

1958
01:47:19,357 --> 01:47:21,167
Absolutely not.

1959
01:47:21,326 --> 01:47:23,895
Can you get me into witness protection?

1960
01:47:23,930 --> 01:47:25,664
Depends what you have.

1961
01:47:25,699 --> 01:47:27,424
I have whitey bulger.

1962
01:47:27,479 --> 01:47:30,361
So, whitey bulger took a
piece of everything you made?

1963
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:32,271
What, are you fucking kidding me?

1964
01:47:32,358 --> 01:47:34,569
Everything. Wasn't small either.

1965
01:47:34,604 --> 01:47:37,069
Yeah, whitey introduced drugs to southie.

1966
01:47:37,124 --> 01:47:38,797
White stuff, brown stuff.

1967
01:47:38,832 --> 01:47:42,713
Cocaine, heroin, marijuana.

1968
01:47:43,156 --> 01:47:44,736
Like I said, I was a half a block away,

1969
01:47:44,771 --> 01:47:47,297
but it was no mistaking what was going on.

1970
01:47:47,335 --> 01:47:48,971
I don't know who it was.

1971
01:47:49,006 --> 01:47:50,872
Pulled him out of a car and
shot him on the fucking...

1972
01:47:50,907 --> 01:47:52,611
Right on the ground.

1973
01:47:56,572 --> 01:47:58,645
It's everything...

1974
01:47:58,721 --> 01:48:04,068
Extortion, racketeering, murder.

1975
01:48:04,782 --> 01:48:06,914
They got you on all of it.

1976
01:48:07,590 --> 01:48:09,901
And I guess they got me, too.

1977
01:48:12,361 --> 01:48:14,364
You used me, Jimmy.

1978
01:48:14,971 --> 01:48:18,461
It was an alliance, John, nothing more.

1979
01:48:21,615 --> 01:48:23,263
I'll call you in a week.

1980
01:48:23,389 --> 01:48:25,389
Just let me know what you know.

1981
01:48:25,457 --> 01:48:27,971
There's nothing more I'm gonna know.

1982
01:48:28,950 --> 01:48:30,369
Ever.

1983
01:48:37,031 --> 01:48:38,531
Okay.

1984
01:48:47,681 --> 01:48:50,332
_

1985
01:49:08,774 --> 01:49:09,751
gentlemen.

1986
01:49:09,806 --> 01:49:11,541
John connolly?

1987
01:49:11,677 --> 01:49:14,027
Yeah, I'm John connolly.

1988
01:49:14,062 --> 01:49:15,991
We have a warrant for your arrest.

1989
01:49:19,808 --> 01:49:22,146
Mr. connolly, step out
of the building, please.

1990
01:49:24,370 --> 01:49:25,730
Mm.

1991
01:49:29,067 --> 01:49:32,736
Do me a favor, boys, and let
me leave with some... dignity.

1992
01:49:32,808 --> 01:49:35,372
Mr. connolly, step out
of the building, please.

1993
01:49:35,971 --> 01:49:37,974
Mr. connolly, this way.

1994
01:49:40,722 --> 01:49:42,063
All right.

1995
01:49:44,367 --> 01:49:47,404
You know, this is, uh... uh...

1996
01:50:14,215 --> 01:50:17,132
Show me your hands,
Stevie! Show me your hands!

1997
01:50:17,306 --> 01:50:19,320
Up in the air! Turn around slow!

1998
01:50:19,355 --> 01:50:21,802
The other way. The other way!

1999
01:50:22,107 --> 01:50:24,183
Put your hands on your head.

2000
01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:26,825
Put your hands on your head!

2001
01:50:28,311 --> 01:50:31,479
Mr. flemmi, now that you look back

2002
01:50:31,539 --> 01:50:36,920
at your time with James bulger,
what is your opinion of him?

2003
01:50:44,078 --> 01:50:46,239
Strictly criminal.

2004
01:51:14,980 --> 01:51:16,435
Jimmy?

2005
01:51:17,582 --> 01:51:19,502
Hey, Billy boy.

2006
01:51:19,812 --> 01:51:22,292
Been reading the papers?

2007
01:51:22,395 --> 01:51:24,515
Not even a little.

2008
01:51:24,646 --> 01:51:26,350
Smart man.

2009
01:51:26,996 --> 01:51:29,354
I wouldn't if I was you.

2010
01:51:30,159 --> 01:51:32,476
Well, listen...

2011
01:51:35,685 --> 01:51:40,431
...you're not gonna see
me for a while, you know?

2012
01:51:40,466 --> 01:51:41,999
So, uh...

2013
01:51:43,402 --> 01:51:46,191
Just look after yourself, you know?

2014
01:51:46,226 --> 01:51:48,990
You sure you want to do it this way?

2015
01:51:49,751 --> 01:51:51,821
Is there any other way?

2016
01:51:57,052 --> 01:51:58,781
Take care, kid.

2017
01:52:29,174 --> 01:52:41,635
_

2018
01:52:46,057 --> 01:52:54,099

2019
01:52:55,159 --> 01:53:01,863

01:53:03,029 --> 01:53:07,122

01:53:07,961 --> 01:53:16,397

_

2028
01:54:37,421 --> 01:54:39,112
- let's begin this morning with the breaking news...
- FBI! You're under arrest!

2029
01:54:39,147 --> 01:54:40,633
The overnight arrest of mob
boss James "whitey" bulger.

2030
01:54:40,668 --> 01:54:42,008
Anybody who's ever been in Boston

2031
01:54:42,076 --> 01:54:44,129
knows who whitey bulger is.

2032
01:54:44,164 --> 01:54:47,053
Whether or not bulger
actually made the risky move...

2033
01:54:47,088 --> 01:54:49,127
Last night, in Santa Monica,
California, the FBI finally...

2034
01:54:49,162 --> 01:54:50,837
He's talking a bit to federal authorities,

2035
01:54:50,872 --> 01:54:53,163
and, Scott, bulger will
be returned to Boston

2036
01:54:53,198 --> 01:54:54,734
to face trial.
