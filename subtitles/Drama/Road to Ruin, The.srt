1
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,400
(Man) Welcome to the University
of Ithaca. This is it, right here.

2
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm gonna give you a good tour today.

3
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,900
Show you as much as you need to know.

4
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,900
This is the main area
of the university.

5
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,400
You'll be getting used to this area.

6
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,100
This is sort of where you congregate.

7
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,200
Come in around me. Keep close.

8
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,500
I've had problems
with stragglers before, OK?

9
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,800
They get lost in the back
and hit by trucks, OK?

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,800
It's not pretty. This is the...

11
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:32,000
By the way, this is the Joseph
H Nelson Memorial Library here, OK?

12
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,700
It was built, uh...
It was built, uh, in the 1600s.

13
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,500
1600s? It says 1951.

14
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,100
(Sniggering)

15
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,000
That's the address. OK? Wise-ass.

16
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,200
That's the psychology department.

17
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,200
You're expected to volunteer for
cutting-edge experimental testing.

18
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,100
Kind of cool.

19
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,600
When it's your turn, remember
to wear loose clothes, no metal,

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,500
and be prepared to receive several
heavy doses of electric current.

21
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,900
They're watching us right now.

22
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,900
Over there
is the department of English.

23
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,700
Most of you speak English already
so we can skip that.

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,600
- How long have you been here?
- Eight years.

25
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,600
(All laughing)

26
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,500
You don't seem to know anything.
This is the worst tour ever.

27
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,500
It's the worst school ever.
Doesn't anything cool happen?

28
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,500
Yeah, cool stuff happens.

29
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,100
This university
is the coolest place in the world.

30
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,400
That's because
he's never been anywhere else.

31
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,700
(All laughing)

32
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,600
Go ahead, laugh all you want.

33
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,100
But the fact is, this is the setting
for the greatest story ever told.

34
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,900
OK?

35
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,000
It's about this guy I knew,
Josh Parker,

36
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,300
and his girlfriend, Tiffany.

37
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,600
It's one of the most
fascinating journeys ever.

38
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,500
'Josh and Tiffany
were always together,

39
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,400
'starting from when they were little.

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,500
'They did everything as a team.

41
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,100
'When Tiffany was 10,
she had her tonsils taken out.

42
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,400
'Josh stayed in the hospital
for three days.

43
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,500
'They were best friends.

44
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,000
'What started out as friendship...

45
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:36,500
'blossomed into some serious French
kissing and lots of heavy petting.

46
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,500
'They spent so much time together
that even their dogs started dating.

47
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,700
'They seemed destined
to be together forever.

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,300
'But after high school, they faced
the most challenging challenge ever -

49
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,900
'a long-distance relationship.

50
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,300
'See, while Josh was enrolled here at
the wonderful University of Ithaca,

51
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,700
'Tiffany went off to
veterinary school in Austin, Texas.

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,500
'But they made a pact,
a promise to stay true to each other,

53
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,900
'to talk every day and maintain
an exclusive relationship.'

54
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,600
That turned out to be more difficult
than either of them ever imagined.

55
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,900
Tiffany! Hey, baby.

56
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,700
Oh, my God.
You were amazing last night.

57
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,000
- I never ever came like that before.
- Come on!

58
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,900
Seriously! I had to take
two birth control pills today.

59
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,700
You wanna help me study
again tonight??

60
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,900
Forget tonight. Come over now.

61
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,200
Let's blow this class off.

62
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,000
(Gasps)

63
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,900
(Ringing)

64
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,800
'Tiffany and Carla can't come to the
phone but please leave a message.'

65
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,800
- (Beep)
- Hey, Tif, it's me...again.

66
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,200
Just wonderin' where you are.
Still trying to get hold of you.

67
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,800
Everything's cool, though.
I'll catch you later.

68
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,100
Call me back, OK? OK. Bye.

69
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,900
I just wanted to add something
before I sent this video.

70
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,000
I haven't talked to you
in a few days and...

71
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,900
I'm thinking you don't like me...
I'm kidding.

72
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,900
Hey, guys.

73
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,300
But I am getting a little worried so
gimme a call when you get a chance.

74
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,100
Barry says hi.

75
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,300
So gimme a call
as soon as you can. I miss you.

76
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,900
- Call me, OK? Bye.
- (Laughing)

77
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,400
- What's up, guys?
- Not much. You?

78
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,600
I was just finishing my tape to Tif.

79
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,200
(Barry) Mitch, what are you doing?
Are you hungry? Huh?

80
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,200
- You gonna feed him?
- No, I'm checking the temperature.

81
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,600
Mitch needs an evenly distributed
85 degrees to survive.

82
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,800
Can I drop a mouse in?

83
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,400
Mitch only eats once a week,
on Saturdays.

84
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,700
Maybe we could cut a mouse in half,

85
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,700
and we could feed him half now
and the other half on Saturday.

86
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,200
I don't think so.
I thought you had class now?

87
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,500
What time is it?? Oh, shit!

88
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,100
Do me a favour -
when this is rewound, mail it for me?

89
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,200
- No problem. Leave it there.
- Thanks, man.

90
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,800
- See you guys later.
- Bye.

91
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,600
Can we please feed him now?

92
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
No. If you overfeed him he could die.

93
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,100
So? It'll be worth it.

94
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,700
- Josh, hey.
- Beth, hey.

95
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,900
- What's goin' on?
- Not much.

96
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,200
- Where have you been?
- Nowhere.

97
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,100
Studying. I'm starting
to question this college thing.

98
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,400
There's so much reading.

99
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,300
- Right. (Chuckles)
- Yeah.

100
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,800
- You going to EL's tonight??
- Yeah.

101
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
(Josh) I gotta run,
class has started.

102
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,900
- I'll see you tonight.
- Yeah. Sorry.

103
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,500
So, you have a thing
for that guy now, is that it??

104
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,000
- It's not your business, Jacob.
- I can tell.

105
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,000
- I'm not having this conversation.
- What conversation?

106
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,200
You need to stop this.
We're not a couple.

107
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,000
We've never been a couple,
and never will.

108
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,200
(Professor) This week
I'd like you to think about

109
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,100
Plato's Dialogues
of the middle years.

110
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,800
"The Republic", "Phaedo",
"Symposium".

111
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,500
Now, this will all be
on next week's mid-term,

112
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,800
so I suggest you read up on it.

113
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,500
Ah, Jacob,
do you have anything to add?

114
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,200
Just a reminder.

115
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,900
The mid-term will cover
all of the in-class lectures

116
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,400
as well as
all of the assigned readings.

117
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,300
It will be entirely essay form,
so bring legal pads.

118
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,000
I prefer yellow.
It's easier on the eyes.

119
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,700
OK. OK? Yeah. Thank you, Jacob.

120
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,700
And...see you all next week
for the mid-term.

121
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,400
- Josh.
- Yes?

122
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,300
I saw you hitting on Beth.
NOT a good idea.

123
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,200
- She's spoken for.
- What??

124
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,600
She'll come back to me.
They always do.

125
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,700
So... Mr Parker.

126
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,500
Do you intend
to be ready for this exam?

127
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,000
- Yes, sir.
- Well, you better be ready.

128
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,300
Because I was
looking over the books last night

129
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,000
and you need a B on this test
just to pass this class.

130
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,300
Actually,
I double-checked that, Professor.

131
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,000
He needs a B+.
We can't bend on this.

132
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,300
I got it.

133
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,800
- Just copy off someone.
- I can't. It's all essays.

134
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,700
If I fail this class,
my average is shot.

135
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,400
I might lose my financial aid
or not be allowed back.

136
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,300
Well, you're fucked, then.

137
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,600
So come to my party, hook up
with Beth, and enjoy your last week.

138
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:50,700
I'm not hooking up with anyone.
I'm invested in this relationship.

139
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Invested? Who are you, Charles
Schwab? Listen to yourself!

140
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,200
I would give my life...

141
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,700
for one evening
of consensual sex with that girl.

142
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,400
I've gone this long without cheating.

143
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,300
You're already cheating!

144
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,500
Any time you pass up sex
you cheat yourself.

145
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,700
The window of opportunity
to drink and do drugs

146
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,500
and take advantage
of young girls is shrinking daily.

147
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,300
I gotta make a call.

148
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,100
I'm telling you, you pass this up,
it'll haunt you forever.

149
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,300
Your dick will never forgive you.

150
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,000
What do you think, man? Don't you
want to experience something new?

151
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,700
(Squeaky voice)
It ain't easy being Josh's penis.

152
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,500
We've been here two months,
and I feel like I'm in a coma.

153
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,200
- Stop it.
- I wish I was your dick, EL.

154
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,800
If something doesn't happen soon,
I'm gonna leave.

155
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,100
- Enough.
- (Girl) 'Hello? '

156
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,000
Carla, it's Josh. Sorry to bother
you, is Tiffany around?

157
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,200
Tiffany is not here.

158
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,300
She didn't sleep here
last night...again.

159
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,900
And it would be great
if for one hour you didn't call.

160
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,700
- Right.
- If she wanted to talk to you

161
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,800
she'd call you.

162
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,800
Deal with it.

163
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,600
- You bitch!
- Does she sound hot??

164
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,000
We've never gone this long
without talking. Something's wrong.

165
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,100
She found someone else,
like you should.

166
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:27,300
The clock is ticking. Before you know
it you'll be 40 and paying for girls.

167
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,700
# She good-looking
got a mojo cooking

168
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,900
# Yeah, wouldn't give me
the time of day

169
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,200
# But if my occupation
was stars and constellations

170
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,000
# We could get together
in the Milky Way

171
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,200
# And everybody wanna know somebody

172
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,300
# Everyone wants to drop your name

173
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,300
# You need no reservation
no special invitation

174
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,200
# No college education
if you've got fortune and fame... #

175
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,200
Oh, yeah! Whoo-hoo!

176
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,300
I should really warn you,

177
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:11,600
it's been known to affect
your decision-making abilities

178
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,900
and lower your inhibitions.

179
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,200
Good. That's the plan.

180
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,900
No, that-that's...
Yes, that is the plan.

181
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,800
- You bring cash?
- Why?

182
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,300
- We've got chicks for sale.
- What??

183
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,700
# Hey, now I'm snappy
got my mojo... #

184
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,700
Trust me. I've been goin'
to this school seven years

185
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,600
and I know the key
to a well-rounded college education

186
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,000
is experimentation.

187
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,500
Let me show you.

188
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,500
This is an auction. Remember...

189
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,100
you are not buying the girl,

190
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,400
only her company, and sale does not
constitute sexual relations.

191
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,900
(Groaning)

192
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,300
(EL) I know. Believe me, I've tried.

193
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,600
Without further ado,
let's introduce our first...person.

194
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,700
- Laura!
- (Applause)

195
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,800
Laura's from Long Island.

196
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,900
She likes the outdoors
and loves seafood.

197
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,900
- OK, let's start the bidding at $5!
- $3.50!

198
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,300
Good God, moneybags,
she's not a Happy Meal.

199
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,800
(Laughter)

200
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,700
- $5.
- OK, we've got five. Do I hear 10?

201
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,100
- 10 bucks.
- (Auctioneer calling)

202
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,100
Who's got 15 bucks
for a lovely evening with Laura?!

203
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,200
OK, we got 15. Who can beat 15?
Going once, going twice...

204
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,100
Sold...to the captain.

205
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,600
(Applause)

206
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,500
There you are.

207
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,000
- Hey, what's going on?
- Not much.

208
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
- You look great.
- Thank you.

209
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,000
You're welcome.

210
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,500
Listen, Jacob's here,
and he's a total psycho...

211
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,200
Can you go outbid him?

212
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,400
You know what,
I didn't bring that much money.

213
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,000
You don't understand. He's obsessed.

214
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,300
See? That's fun, right??

215
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:10,800
OK, PK. Now, I want you two
to kiss each other.

216
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,300
All right, has anyone seen Beth?
There she is!

217
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,000
- (Cheering)
- Say hi to the crowd, Beth.

218
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,800
Hi.

219
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,900
Can I hear a $5 opening bid?

220
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,000
- $5 right here!
- Who can beat five?

221
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,800
- Seven.
- $10.

222
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,500
- $10! Going once. Going twice.
- $15!

223
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,200
- 20.
- 25!

224
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,700
25. Who can beat 25? Going once.

225
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,400
- Going twice.
- 26.

226
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,600
- 26, going once.
- 30!

227
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,900
- OK, can anyone beat $26?
- I just said 30!

228
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,800
There must be someone
who can beat $26?

229
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:57,000
- Me, right here! 30!
- Sold! To my man Josh for $26.

230
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,000
(Applause)

231
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,100
You heard me.
I bid $30 loud and clear.

232
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,800
Your bid didn't count.

233
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
- Why?
- Because you're a TA.

234
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,600
- So?
- This auction is for students.

235
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,400
Goodbye.

236
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,500
# On and on until the early morning

237
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:22,600
# They're rockin' on and on
until the early morning... #

238
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,500
(Beth giggles)

239
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,500
Thanks for doing that. I owe you one.

240
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,800
- You owe me more than one.
- Do I?

241
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,500
Technically.

242
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,500
Well...

243
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,000
are you ready to collect?

244
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,800
I think so. Yeah.

245
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,200
We're touching.

246
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,300
It's a lot of fun. (Chuckles)

247
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,300
- We're having a good time.
- (Chuckles)

248
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,100
(Romantic music)

249
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,600
Who's Tiffany Henderson?

250
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,200
Just some girl I used to date
since I was, like, five.

251
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,700
But that's over now. She blew me off.

252
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Oh, poor baby.

253
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
You must be very hurt.

254
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,800
Do you need some special attention?

255
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,700
Well, I am pretty upset.

256
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,700
Did that help?

257
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,900
That helped a lot.

258
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,000
I have an idea.

259
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,200
What do you say?

260
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
Uh, I don't think so.

261
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,700
Come on! It'll be fun.

262
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,300
- I've always wanted to try this.
- No...

263
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,100
Yes.

264
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,600
I'm gonna interview you.

265
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,500
Fine.

266
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,500
OK.

267
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,900
- OK, Josh.
- Yes.

268
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,900
What do you look for in a girl??

269
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,800
Um, well, let's see.

270
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,900
She should be smart and funny and...

271
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,000
That's good, too.

272
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,800
Do you feel better yet??

273
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,700
I feel a little bit better.
Yeah. A little...

274
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,300
What else do you look for??

275
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,200
She should be attractive and...

276
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,800
nice and...

277
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,100
Topless. And topless.

278
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,800
And she should kiss me.

279
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,600
What else?

280
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,100
She shouldn't stop kissing me.

281
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,600
Why don't you keep doing that??

282
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,700
# Tiny salmon swimming in a stream

283
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,700
# Tiny salmon
chasing that impossible dream

284
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,700
# The mynah bird says

285
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,200
(Caws)

286
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,200
(Caws)

287
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,600
# The chimpanzee says

288
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,900
(Screeches)

289
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,300
# The friendly owl says

290
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,100
(Hoots)

291
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,200
# But the salmon can only say

292
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,300
(Blubbers)

293
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,700
# And it's sad #

294
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,600
(Hums cheerfully)

295
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,500
# Good morning, everyone.

296
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,000
# Good morning, everyone.

297
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,600
# How are you and you and you #

298
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,800
What are you so happy about??

299
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,100
I don't know.
Do I seem happy this morning?

300
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,400
Well, you're bouncing around here.

301
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,300
You do seem
unusually light-hearted.

302
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,300
Maybe it's because I had
the best time of my life last night.

303
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,400
Twice! And once this morning.

304
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,600
You and Beth?

305
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,700
- Oh, yeah.
- Shut up. What happened?

306
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,300
No way! You're lying.

307
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,700
I'm not lying.

308
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,400
You can't make out with someone
then pretend you had sex.

309
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,100
- That's really uncool.
- I'm not pretending.

310
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,500
Forget it. I know you're lying.
I guarantee it.

311
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,000
You wanna bet??

312
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,700
Great. I'm gonna bet
on something you can't prove.

313
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,400
You videotaped it!

314
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,600
No, no, no, I didn't!
Gimme that! Gimme that!

315
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,500
- No way! This is amazing!
- I was kidding, I was kidding!

316
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,800
- Gimme the tape.
- Huh? Come on.

317
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,900
- We're gonna see it sooner or later.
- He's got a point.

318
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,500
Oh-ho! Oh, no! Oh, no!

319
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,300
Give it to me. No, give it to me.

320
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,300
- EL, no.
- Josh, please? We need this.

321
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:28,200
OK, listen, seriously.
You can't tell anyone you saw this.

322
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,900
Oh, yeah.

323
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,500
OK. PK!

324
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,600
Barry, hit the lights.

325
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,700
It's boner time!

326
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,300
'Hey, Tif. It's me
coming to you live from Ithaca.'

327
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,800
I thought I asked you
to mail this yesterday?

328
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,400
Yeah, you did. I mailed it today.

329
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,000
Fast-forward to the horny stuff.

330
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,900
Is this the shit
you've been sending Tiffany?

331
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,400
Oh, my God.

332
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,600
# It's you... #

333
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,900
Oh, fuck!

334
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,600
Oh, my God! No, no, no, no.

335
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
Oh, God!

336
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,300
W-wait a second.

337
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,400
Tell me you mailed
the Beth tape to Tiffany.

338
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,500
Yes!

339
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,700
Shit! Oh, no! Oh, no!

340
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,400
Hey, hey.

341
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,400
Did you make a copy?

342
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,300
If you made a copy,
we could watch the copy.

343
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,700
(Rings)

344
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
Don't answer it!

345
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,000
(Answer machine) 'Hey, it's
Josh and Rubin. Leave a message.'

346
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,300
'Hi, Josh. It's Tiffany.

347
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,500
'Sorry we haven't spoken.

348
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,300
'Listen, my grandfather passed away.

349
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,200
'I've tried calling you
a few times, but no one picked up.

350
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,000
'I didn't want to leave
this message on your machine

351
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,500
'but by now you're probably
a little worried so...

352
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,100
'Anyway, I'm at my parents'
house helping my mom.

353
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,900
'She's really a wreck.

354
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,000
'If I don't speak with you,
I'll call Monday.

355
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,900
'I'll be OK. I just need some time.

356
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,900
'Bye. I love you.'

357
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,300
(Dialling tone)

358
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,800
That's not fair.

359
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,300
How come she gets to see the tape
and we don't??

360
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,900
She gets back there Monday.
That leaves three days to get there.

361
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,400
Get where? Austin?

362
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,900
- That's like 10,000 miles from here.
- 1,800.

363
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,600
You wanna drive 1,800 miles
in three days? Just fly.

364
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,500
Do you have money for a ticket??
I don't.

365
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,900
- All right, so we're driving.
- You're coming?

366
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,300
What else am I gonna do,
stay here and learn?

367
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,100
Road trip.

368
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,300
(Behind door) Just a minute. Hold on.

369
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,200
He's probably jackin' off.

370
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,200
What do you guys want??

371
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,100
Kyle, this is an emergency.

372
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,400
Wait. Let me at least
go back and call my dad.

373
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,000
Call your dad?
Would you listen to yourself?

374
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,400
You're 19 years old,
and you're a fucking sissy.

375
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,900
All you ever do is sit
in a library and play Myst.

376
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,000
It's pathetic.

377
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,200
He's trying to say that
this is your chance to do something.

378
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,400
Be a risk-taker. Come with us.

379
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,200
You're just saying that
because you want my car.

380
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,700
No! No, we've always liked you.

381
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,300
Or just give us the car.
That would make him a risk-taker.

382
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,600
Shut up, all right??
He's coming with us.

383
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,500
Come on, Kyle. It'll be fun!

384
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,600
Aren't you even curious
where we're going?

385
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,600
No.

386
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:23,100
OK, we're going to the University
of Austin. Sure you won't come?

387
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,800
I don't like Massachusetts.

388
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,500
Austin's in Texas.
You're thinking of Boston.

389
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,500
You've never left this town,
have you?

390
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,600
No, not really.

391
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,700
That could turn
into a debilitating phobia.

392
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,400
OK.

393
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,500
- Can I feed Mitch?
- Yes, actually you can.

394
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,300
There's a brown box of mice
by his cage.

395
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,800
Give him one tomorrow. Just one.

396
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,700
- I'll feed him a mouse tomorrow.
- OK.

397
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,500
You can count on me.
OK? I'm reliable. OK?

398
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,100
You guys do good.
Have a good trip, safe trip.

399
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,800
Buckle up your seat belt.
I'm gonna feed the snake!

400
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,100
I'll feed the snake,
I'll watch the snake.

401
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,100
(Barry) 'So off they went.'

402
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,900
They had 1,800 miles to go,
and only three days to do it.

403
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,500
It was a killer journey and one
that changed them all forever.

404
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,700
The end.

405
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,600
- So we're gonna go look over here.
- Whoa. That's it?? This story sucks.

406
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,900
- What happened with the tape?
- Right. The tape.

407
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,900
Well, um...

408
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,200
Well... Like I said,
they were on a race against time.

409
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:53,100
# The smoke stack spitting black soot
into the sooty sky

410
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:01,600
# The load on the road brings a tear
to the Indian's eye... #

411
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,200
Since we didn't get to see the tape,

412
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,900
- can you at least describe it??
- No.

413
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,800
# The elephant won't forget
what it's like inside his cage

414
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:19,600
# The ringmaster's Telecaster
sings on an empty stage... #

415
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,100
Admit that Beth is amazing.

416
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,100
I admit it, she's amazing.
She's perfect.

417
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,900
I don't know why you feel so guilty.
Technically you haven't cheated.

418
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,100
What are you talking about??

419
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,000
There are these rules that guys have,

420
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,600
an understanding
as to what constitutes cheating.

421
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,600
Take your situation, for example.

422
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,700
It's not cheating.

423
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:49,300
Not when you're in a different
area code - not to mention state!

424
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,400
That makes no sense.

425
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,600
Don't look at me, Kyle.
I don't make the rules.

426
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,200
This is legit. I've read an article.

427
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,600
There's a whole bunch of them,
like loopholes.

428
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,400
Say you were sleeping with
two girls at the same time,

429
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,100
it's not cheating
because they cancel each other out.

430
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,000
- Ahh.
- Exactly!

431
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,800
Or if you're too wasted
to remember...

432
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,900
It is not cheating.

433
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,700
Because if you
can't really remember it,

434
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,800
it never really took place.

435
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,200
# Uh-huh

436
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,700
# Whoo-oo... #

437
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,200
OK, I've got one. Ready?

438
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,100
It's OK if you spread peanut butter
on your testicles

439
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,700
and let your dog lick it off.

440
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,100
- Because it's your dog!
- Jesus Christ!

441
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,400
- You know, because it's your dog!
- We got it.

442
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,500
# Whoo-oo, uh-huh

443
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,000
# Goddam right, it's a beautiful day

444
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,400
# Uh-huh, goddam right #

445
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,400
Somebody's gonna die tomorrow.

446
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,300
That's right.
One of you is marked for death.

447
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,200
And first thing tomorrow morning,

448
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,800
a chosen one
will experience nature's wrath

449
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,900
in all its fury.

450
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,100
(Hums gloomy religious chant)

451
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,200
Who are you?

452
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,000
I'm Beth.

453
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,000
Are you here for the feeding?

454
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,000
Excuse me?

455
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,100
You're early. It's not till tomorrow.

456
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,100
You should come back.

457
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,600
It's gonna be a bloodbath.

458
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,600
I think I'll pass.

459
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,700
Have you seen Josh?

460
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,800
He went to visit his girlfriend.

461
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,900
Tiffany?

462
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,400
I thought they broke up.

463
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:03,100
I mean this girl who's a friend
of his. You know what I mean.

464
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,100
Where did he go?

465
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,500
Austin?

466
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,700
Austin, Massachusetts?

467
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,100
You mean Boston, Massachusetts?

468
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,200
Yeah, that's what I said. Boston.

469
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,400
The University of Boston
in Massachusetts.

470
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,300
He is such an asshole.

471
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,700
I can't believe
he just lied to my face like that.

472
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,800
I actually thought he liked me.
How could he do that??

473
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,800
- She was topless?
- Girls don't stand around naked.

474
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:46,300
Yeah, they do. OK? This is my story.
You wanna hear it or not??

475
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:51,000
- It just doesn't make any...
- Shh. Please, no interruptions, OK?

476
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:57,700
So this other girl walks up,
totally hot. Naked! Really naked!

477
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,800
I know guys can be jerks.

478
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,700
I guess I just thought
Josh was different. I liked him.

479
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,600
Sweetie, listen to me.
They're all the same.

480
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,600
All men are perverted pigs.

481
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:17,600
All they care about...
really, all they THINK about is sex.

482
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:22,700
- You're so right. I feel so used.
- Face it, we're all used.

483
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,300
In most men's eyes, we're just flesh.

484
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,200
- It's so sick!
- It IS sick. Think about it.

485
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,500
If they had it their way...

486
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,700
God, I don't even want to know
what would happen

487
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,200
if they had it their way!

488
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,400
(Beth) What am I supposed to do
now that he's gone?

489
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,500
- Go to Boston and bust his ass.
- Right.

490
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,400
Confront him
and his little girlfriend.

491
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,500
Face to face. You totally should!

492
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,700
Show her what an asshole Josh is,
right??

493
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,500
Hmm...

494
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,900
# I'm freakin' you, baby

495
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,900
# Drivin' you crazy

496
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,900
# I'm freakin' you, baby

497
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,900
# Drivin' you crazy

498
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,200
# I'm freakin' you, baby... #

499
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,900
Ooh! These, too.

500
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,600
# I'm freakin' you, baby

501
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,300
# Drivin' you crazy... #

502
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,600
Kyle, come here for a second.

503
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,500
We're a little
short on cash right now,

504
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,500
so we need to put this
on your credit card.

505
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,500
We'll give you the cash
when we get back, I promise.

506
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,300
I can't. It's my dad's.
It's for emergencies only.

507
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,100
Hello! This IS an emergency.

508
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,400
We need this stuff.
You want us to sleep in the dirt??

509
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,000
# I'm freakin' you, baby
drivin' you crazy

510
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,800
# When I get to your place

511
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,900
# I wanna turn up the highs
and turn up the bass... #

512
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,400
(Josh) We're in no-man's-land.

513
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,200
We've been on this road
for over an hour.

514
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,200
This is gonna save us five hours,
minimum. Thank me later.

515
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,900
We should go back to the interstate.

516
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,200
- We're not goin' back.
- Yeah, have some faith.

517
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,500
It's a challenge.
That's why it's a short cut.

518
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,300
If it was easy,
it would just be the way.

519
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,400
(Josh) Damn it! Fuck!

520
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,800
I give us 20 minutes
before our first ass-raping.

521
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,700
If we turn around we'll lose
five hours backtracking.

522
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,100
Turn around? Why? Because of this?
We could make it.

523
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:33,000
Make it?? You mean jump it??

524
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,600
No. Absolutely not.
No way. We're going back.

525
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:41,900
It can be done. This incline
is 30 degrees roughly, right??

526
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,000
The factory weight
of the car is 1,600lbs.

527
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,900
Add us, plus cargo...

528
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,200
- No, no.
- If we hit this at 50mph,

529
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,600
our trajectory
will clear 10 feet, easy.

530
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,500
No way. Absolutely not.

531
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,900
We'll go 60 just to be certain.

532
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,800
(Kyle) We're goin' back.
It's impossible.

533
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,700
You sure?

534
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,400
With physics I'm always sure.

535
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,300
I'm driving.

536
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,500
I don't think you guys heard me.

537
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:14,000
This is my car
and we're not gonna jump any rivers.

538
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:18,300
Kyle, it's 10 feet. Bob Hope
could jump this in a golf cart.

539
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,900
Look, I can spit across this gap.

540
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,800
(Hawks)

541
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,500
Yeah.

542
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,200
Well...

543
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,300
better make it 75.

544
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,500
- OK. Let's do it.
- Trust me, Kyle, it's science.

545
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,400
No, you guys. No.
EL, get out of my car.

546
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,500
Kyle, in the car. Come on.

547
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,100
(Revving)

548
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,800
We're PK.

549
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,800
You know we need to hit 60?

550
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,500
- I'm trying. This car sucks.
- Stop!

551
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,400
(All yelling)

552
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,100
(EL) Thank you! Yes!

553
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,500
What did I tell you?

554
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,900
Oh, my God.

555
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,000
Oh, my God!

556
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,800
(Sniffs)

557
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
My father is gonna kill me
when he finds out about this.

558
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,500
I only said we'd make it across.

559
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,500
I never said
the wheels would stay on.

560
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,900
What the hell are we gonna do now?!

561
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,200
I'm totally screwed!

562
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,400
I don't have time...
to be walking...through the woods!

563
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:20,400
Josh, we'll call a tow truck,
have the axles fixed.

564
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:24,000
We'll lose half a day at most.
It's just the wheels.

565
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,500
(Beth) The minute I think
I feel something for someone,

566
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,500
they just turn around
and screw me over.

567
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,400
Just something about Josh,
he's just different.

568
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,700
I feel like we had a connection.

569
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,900
I don't think
I'll ever be able to trust a guy.

570
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:04,800
You shouldn't! Honey, the last time
I trusted a man was back in 1985

571
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,700
and he took off
with my sister and my van.

572
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,100
It was a regular-size van.
Before that mini-van crap.

573
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,700
So there's no hope, huh?

574
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:20,200
Oh, there's hope.
But it comes with batteries.

575
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,400
(Buzzing)

576
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,500
You can keep that.

577
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,200
(Kyle) God. Crap.

578
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,500
(EL) Listen, guys,
we're gonna have to be more careful.

579
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,500
We almost died in that explosion.

580
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:45,300
- I wish I had died.
- I'm serious. I can't die young.

581
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,400
Something tells me the people
of Earth are gonna need me.

582
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,700
I must live.

583
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,700
Yeah, right. We all must live.

584
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,100
Before we do that,
we must get back on the road.

585
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:04,500
(Josh) We shouldn't be going
to sleep right now!

586
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,500
(Phone)

587
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:13,000
'Let's just lay
an indication here and there.'

588
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,700
(Phone)

589
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,400
(TV) 'And a whole bunch of colour...'

590
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,800
- (Sighs)
- (Ringing)

591
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,700
Excuse me.

592
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,300
I'm sorry, do you need to get that??

593
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,700
Do you need something?

594
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,200
Yeah.
This is sort of an unusual question.

595
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,500
But do you have any marijuana
I might buy?

596
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,700
Our car exploded last night
and I'm practically all out.

597
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,900
Am I a drug dealer??

598
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:55,700
No, I am not.
Thank you for asking, though.

599
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,700
No? OK, that's OK. Thanks.

600
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,600
Is there anything else
I can help with?

601
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,100
Perhaps you'd like an 11-year-old
prostitute. We can do that.

602
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,000
Or maybe we can off someone
for you. Huh?

603
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,800
I've got it.
Why don't we start small??

604
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,400
Would you like a fresh towel??

605
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,900
You could roll that up and smoke it.

606
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,200
Dick.

607
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,400
By the way, Cheech,

608
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,700
that credit card
you guys gave me was maxed out,

609
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:32,900
so don't go spending all your cash
on needles and guns just yet.

610
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,500
Um, Mr Earl Edwards?

611
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,700
I'm sorry, sir.
This card's over its limit.

612
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:50,000
That's not true. Put it through
your little machine again.

613
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:54,900
I tried three times, sir. If you
have another card, I'd be happy to...

614
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,100
Don't give me any attitude.

615
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,100
You go fix
that little toy back there,

616
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,300
and charge this friggin' card.

617
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,800
We've been coming here for 20 years.

618
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,300
- We've only been open eight years.
- Do it now.

619
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,600
(EL) Relax, it's not a big deal.

620
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:18,100
(Rubin) You don't understand,
when Josh finds out he'll freak.

621
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,200
You can't rent a car without
a credit card. You just can't.

622
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,600
So, what are we gonna do?

623
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,800
Tell you what. Stay here.

624
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,800
Take him out
for breakfast or something.

625
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I'll go take care of this.

626
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:40,700
Earl, Cookie, we have a situation.
Now, brace yourselves.

627
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,200
The police have found Kyle's car
abandoned in Bedford, Pennsylvania.

628
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,800
It's been blown to bits.

629
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,700
We checked with the university -
he's missing.

630
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,300
Mother of God.

631
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,400
- (Woman) Good morning.
- Hello.

632
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,800
Hi. How can I help you?

633
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,700
Yeah, hi. I was sent over here
to check out bus 111,

634
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,700
and I'm afraid I have some bad news.

635
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,900
You seem to be having problems
with the...rotator splint.

636
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,200
Engines have rotator splints?

637
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,000
Yeah.

638
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,900
She runs good now, but not for long.

639
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,300
I can have it back to you
as good as new in a week.

640
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,300
Let's see.
Well, Jared's still in Aliquippa,

641
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,400
- I take it he called you from there?
- Yeah.

642
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,200
Five days.
Well, I think we can work that out.

643
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,900
Would you please not feed my dog?

644
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,500
I didn't.

645
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,600
You can't feed
Seeing Eye dogs treats.

646
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,400
I'd appreciate it
if you left him alone.

647
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,000
Don't roll your eyes at me.

648
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,100
French toast.

649
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,500
Bacon. Good for you.

650
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,800
- And scrambled eggs.
- Thank you.

651
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,300
Excuse me, but this has powdered
sugar on it, and I ordered no sugar.

652
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,500
I can't have
too much sugar in the morning.

653
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,900
Oh, I'm sorry,
you're absolutely right.

654
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:47,700
Tell you what, let me take this back
and bring you out a new piece.

655
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,300
Is everybody good? OK, great.

656
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:55,100
Do you know where my possessions are,
because I can't...

657
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,600
- Wait, no. They were in the car.
- That's...that's hilarious.

658
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,800
All right,
let me warm that up for you.

659
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
- There you go.
- Thanks.

660
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,800
(Farts)

661
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,100
Excuse me. And the French toast
will be out in just a minute.

662
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,000
- OK, thank you.
- OK, great.

663
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,300
French toast, no sugar.

664
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,700
- All right?? Sorry about that.
- No problem.

665
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,600
That's a nice guy.

666
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,500
It's good.

667
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,900
(Tyres squeal)

668
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,200
OK!

669
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,200
I don't wanna know
how you got this.

670
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,000
- I stole it from a blind chick.
- I don't wanna know.

671
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,900
What?? I'm gonna give it back.

672
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,900
Probably.

673
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,600
# Going to work, I hate it

674
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,100
# Shakin' that stick
that drives people crazy

675
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,500
# Doin' that stuff that you do

676
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,000
# Quit messin' me up with your voodoo

677
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,100
# You drive me crazy with that

678
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,700
# Boogie-oogie-oogie-oogie-oogie

679
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:01,400
# You drive me crazy with that boogie

680
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,100
# Boogie, boogie

681
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,900
# Your lips are hot and spicy

682
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,700
# Servin' up cooked beans and rice

683
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,700
# I feel like
she's a hoppin' and stompin'

684
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:18,900
# Makin' love to the gators
in the swamp... #

685
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:29,000
Can we please stop soon?
I need to use the bathroom.

686
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:34,000
Actually, I don't have to go yet,
so we'll stop in a couple of hours.

687
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,100
OK.

688
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,800
I'm kidding, Kyle. We'll stop.

689
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,800
Jeez, you have to stand up
for yourself. Be more assertive.

690
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,100
OK.

691
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,900
What's your deal??
Why are you so worried?

692
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:52,800
I don't know. I guess it's my dad.

693
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:56,100
He's, like...strict.

694
00:45:56,300 --> 00:46:00,800
He really is gonna kill me
when he finds out about that car.

695
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:04,300
So you screwed up. Big deal.
People make mistakes.

696
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:09,000
He'll get over it.
Besides, that car sucked anyways.

697
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,200
I really do need
to go to the bathroom.

698
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,700
- (EL) We're makin' a pit stop.
- (Rubin) Again?!

699
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,600
(Squeaks)

700
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,700
You're about to experience
first-hand...

701
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:27,400
exactly what it means to be in
the lower region of the food chain.

702
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:31,500
Mitch is going to bite into you.

703
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,200
He's going to squeeze.

704
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:39,000
He'll actually start digesting you
while you're still alive.

705
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,400
But don't be scared.

706
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,600
No. No, no.

707
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,300
(Squeaking)

708
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,700
It'll be a quick death.

709
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,200
Be brave.

710
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,000
You'll barely feel it.

711
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,000
Come on.

712
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,300
Come on. You gonna fuckin' eat him?

713
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,700
Josh, wait up a second.

714
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:20,000
This is supposed to be a road trip.

715
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:25,200
All we do is drive the whole time.
It's ridiculous.

716
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,900
- No one forced you to come.
- We're making great time.

717
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:32,400
And if Tiffany saw that tape,
it'd be a good thing.

718
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,700
What is that supposed to mean?

719
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,000
Beth is an angel. She's here
to help you change your life.

720
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:42,900
Besides, did Tiffany
ever let you videotape her??

721
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,200
I think not.

722
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,300
It's a sign, Josh.

723
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:51,100
- (Phone)
- Hello?

724
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:54,100
- 'Professor Anderson? '
- Who's calling?

725
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:57,200
Hi, Professor, it's Josh Parker.

726
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,400
Oh, uh...

727
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:03,200
(Deeper voice) Hello, Josh.
What can I do for you?

728
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:07,200
- Well, I was in a car accident.
- 'Oh. Oh, my God.'

729
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,400
I'm PK.
It's just I'm in kind of a bind.

730
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,200
All my notes and books
were destroyed.

731
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,000
Is it possible to get an extension?

732
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,200
'Maybe take the mid-term
a couple days later?? '

733
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,400
Oh, sure.
Yes, it sounds like an emergency.

734
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,500
How about an extra three days?

735
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:29,500
- 'Would that work? '
- Yeah, that would be fantastic!

736
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,800
- Are you sure?
- 'Just glad you're not hurt.'

737
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,100
I'm marking it down right now.

738
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:38,000
'That's great, Professor. Thank you.'

739
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,100
OK, goodbye.

740
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,400
Who was that??

741
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:46,500
Oh, that...that was Josh Parker.

742
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,100
Oh, yeah? What did he want??

743
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:53,800
He was just confirming
the date of the exam. Such a worrier.

744
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,500
(Siren wails)

745
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:11,700
It's gonna be OK. I'll find him.

746
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:15,900
And we'll find whoever did this,
I promise. It's gonna be OK.

747
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:21,200
If I had to guess, I'd say somebody
was raped and murdered here.

748
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,700
What the hell gives you that idea?

749
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,400
I don't know. It's just a feeling.

750
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,800
- Well??
- Nothing yet.

751
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,800
Good thing is,
there's no evidence of a struggle.

752
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,200
No blood or clothing or anything.

753
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,000
And we haven't found
a single drop of semen yet.

754
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,200
Hi. I'm visiting my friend from home.

755
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,700
But she doesn't know I'm coming.
It's a surprise.

756
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
How nice. How can I help you?

757
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:14,600
I've never been here before.
I don't know where she lives.

758
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,300
What's her name? I can look it up.

759
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,600
Oh, OK. Tiffany Henderson.

760
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,700
Do I know you?

761
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,300
No, you don't.
Actually, I know your boyfriend.

762
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,900
OK. Who are you?

763
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:40,300
I'm Beth.
Could we just sit down for a minute?

764
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,600
OK.

765
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,200
Um, this is really hard for me,

766
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,700
but it's definitely
something you should hear.

767
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:04,600
Your boyfriend is cheating on you...
with me.

768
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,300
We were together Thursday night.

769
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,500
Twice.

770
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:13,200
And once again Friday morning.

771
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,200
I thought you should know.

772
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,200
(Yelling)

773
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,500
Sorry.

774
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,100
Tiffany! What the hell are you doing?

775
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,000
(Crowd gasps)

776
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:39,400
- Who's that guy?
- That's her boyfriend.

777
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,600
THAT's her boyfriend?

778
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,300
Yeah. He's been cheating on her.

779
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,600
(Boyfriend) Baby, I love you!

780
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,400
(Thuds and groans)

781
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,500
I- I'm sorry,

782
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:28,500
but you have the most beautiful feet.

783
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,900
Ohh... Would you like
a foot massage?

784
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,100
No, I would not like a foot massage.

785
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,600
(Louder voice) I would hate
a foot massage!

786
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,000
OK. I'm sorry. Relax.

787
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:46,900
Are there any guys out there
who are just normal??! Huh?!

788
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,600
- (Plucks string)
- Unleash the fury, Mitch.

789
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,900
- (Plucks string)
- Unleash the fury.

790
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,200
(Plucks string)

791
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,100
- Come on, Mitch.
- (Plucks string)

792
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,700
Eat him.

793
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:06,800
Please, Mitch. Go get him, boy.

794
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,800
He's right there. Kill him.

795
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:14,100
Maim him. Bite him.

796
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,200
(Plucks string)

797
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,000
UNLEASH THE FURY!

798
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,600
Wow, this is cool.

799
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,900
I've never been in
a fraternity house before.

800
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,700
Is this gonna work?

801
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:39,100
Of course it's gonna work.
I know the handshake.

802
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,600
Hi.

803
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,600
- Hi. Can I help you?
- Yeah.

804
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,100
I'm Rubin Carver,
a Xi Chi brother from Ithaca.

805
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:53,900
We're just passing through
and looking for a place to party,

806
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,400
maybe even a place to crash.

807
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:09,200
(Alternately) Xi. Chi. Xi, Chi.
Xi, Xi, Xi.

808
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,900
Chi.

809
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:12,700
Hmph.

810
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:16,200
- (Chattering, dishes clattering)
- Wow!

811
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,100
(Silence)

812
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:39,000
Ahem. Uh, everyone, this is Rubin.

813
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:44,100
Apparently, Rubin is our fraternity
brother from our Ithaca chapter.

814
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,300
These are his friends.

815
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:52,600
Listen, uh, we've interrupted
your dinner so we'll just...

816
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:55,100
Hey, don't be crazy.

817
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:58,100
There's plenty of food to go around.

818
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,200
You guys are welcome to stay.

819
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:04,000
(Chattering)

820
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,500
You know, this food's pretty good.

821
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:27,000
Hey, you do realise
this is a national black fraternity?

822
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,300
They know you're not a member.

823
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:34,700
I'm sorry. I don't think
about that kind of stuff.

824
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:38,200
OK, relax. OK?
They're just messing with us.

825
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,500
They're pissed because he lied.

826
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:43,300
- I say we get out of here.
- Shh, relax.

827
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,800
Someone's got some explaining to do.

828
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,400
- Look what we found in his bag.
- What??! What is that??!

829
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,200
No, I've never seen that before!

830
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,500
What are you doin'?
Are you in the Ku Klux Klan?

831
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,900
- Whoa, whoa. That is not ours.
- That's not mine!

832
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:02,700
OK, hold on, th-there's
obviously some explanation.

833
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,700
Yeah, there is. See, your boy's
an evil bigot and now he's gonna die.

834
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,800
Justice!

835
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:18,200
(Josh) Kyle. Kyle.

836
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,500
Kyle!

837
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,600
There you are. I thought we lost you.

838
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,300
- Am I in the hospital??
- You passed out.

839
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:33,500
They were messin' with us, Kyle.
It was a joke.

840
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,700
(All laughing)

841
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:39,900
Racist??
But I watch Oprah Winfrey every day.

842
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,000
It was a joke, outtie. A joke!

843
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,600
- (Laughing continues)
- I get it.

844
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,100
Sure, put a Klan hood in my bag.

845
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:51,000
Yeah. Oh, that's funny.

846
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,900
Whoa.

847
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,800
I need a wine cooler.

848
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,300
- Hey, have mine.
- Thanks.

849
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:01,300
# It's tricky to rock around

850
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,800
# To rock around,
that's right on time

851
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,500
# It's tricky
tricky, tricky, tricky

852
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:10,700
# It's tricky to rock around
to rock around that's right on time

853
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:13,900
# It's tricky
trick-trick-trick-tricky

854
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:18,000
# I met this good girlie
her hair was kinda curly

855
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:21,700
# Went to her house and busted out
I had to leave her early

856
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,100
# These girls are really sleazy,
all they just say is "Please me"

857
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:27,100
# Spend some time and rock around

858
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:29,200
# I said it's not that easy

859
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,900
# It's tricky to rock around

860
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:33,200
# To rock around

# It's tricky to rock around... #

863
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,000
(Cheering)

864
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,600
# In New York the people talk
and try to make us cry

865
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:51,600
# They really hawk but we just walk
because we have no time

866
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,700
# And in the city it's a pity

867
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,500
# Cos we just can't hide

868
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:59,600
# Tinted windows don't mean nothing,
we know who's inside

869
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,200
# It's tricky to rock around

870
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,400
# To rock around
that's right on time

871
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:06,800
# It's tricky
tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky... #

872
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Isn't he just
the cutest little thing?

873
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:12,900
Oh, yeah, Kyle's the man!

874
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:15,600
# Tricky, tricky,
tricky, tricky, huh! #

875
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,300
You mean never?? Not even once?

876
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:30,800
Well... I mean, I've had sex before.

877
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,400
Just, um,

878
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,900
never with a person.

879
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,800
Right.

880
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,600
Well, I think that's kinda cool.

881
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,400
- You do?
- Yeah.

882
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:50,700
I mean, you should hold out.
It should be special.

883
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:56,100
Wait till you're in love.

884
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,100
I think I love you.

885
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,100
You are so cute.

886
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:11,100
# Inside each other

887
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,500
# You can see inside me

888
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,900
# Will you come inside me?

889
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:22,100
# Do you want to ride further up?

890
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,800
# If you can see inside me

891
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,300
# Will you come inside me?

892
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,400
# Do you want to ride... #

893
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:34,500
I take it you don't have a condom?

894
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:37,400
Uh... no.

895
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:40,200
Um, I guess I'm all out.

896
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,300
Well, Lawrence probably has some.

897
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,600
Why don't you try that drawer??

898
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,900
Next to the Old Spice,
behind the belts.

899
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:00,700
Good guess.

900
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,100
You know what??

901
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:17,300
Um, I don't exactly know
what I'm doing and, um...

902
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,800
I'm... Oof.

903
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,300
Shhh. Relax, baby.
Let Rhonda handle this.

904
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:29,000
# Time's a-changing

905
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,300
# More so each year

906
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:35,800
# But the early mornin'

907
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:38,900
# Snow the pimp is here

908
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,300
# So let it rain

909
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:45,100
# And let the guitar rock... #

910
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,900
- Thanks for a great time.
- Take care.

911
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:49,900
Stay cool.

912
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:51,800
Hey, Devon.

913
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,900
What's up?

914
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:03,300
# Well, well, well, well, well

915
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,400
# And I'll be catching them pike

916
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:09,000
# Like on the 10 pound test, success

917
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,700
# Never 'fess, take a guess

918
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:14,500
# I'll be the early morning
snow pimp... #

919
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:18,700
Let's go, Kyle.
We want details. What happened?

920
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,600
Well, we had a few drinks,

921
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:25,100
danced a little, and, you know...

922
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:28,200
No, we don't know.
Why don't you tell us?

923
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,900
- (Laughing)
- What the hell is that??

924
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,200
Did you kill a cheetah?

925
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:41,200
What?? No. These are her underwear.
She gave 'em to me.

926
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,800
- (Sniffs)
- (All groan)

927
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,600
I boinked her!

928
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:48,500
Boinked?

929
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:51,700
Yeah, did you just say
the word "boinked? "

930
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,300
- (All laughing)
- Well, Kyle,

931
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:57,500
I hope you got the boinking
out of your system,

932
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:00,400
cos we got a lot of driving
to do today.

933
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:04,500
Do not get your hopes up
about visiting Graceland,

934
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,700
cos we're about the mission at hand.

935
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:09,900
- Josh.
- What??

936
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:13,500
That sounds like a good plan,
except for one little thing.

937
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:16,900
- What little thing?
- We're out of money.

938
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:21,500
OK, before you fill out these,
I have to ask some questions.

939
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:25,500
If you qualify, you can
make a sperm deposit. Understood?

940
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,900
Mm-hmm. Fire away.

941
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:33,000
Tell the truth, because if you don't
the test will and you won't get paid.

942
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:37,700
So, first off, have any of you
done any drugs in the past 36 hours?

943
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,100
And that includes marijuana.

944
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,000
(Groans)

945
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,400
(Nurse) PK, next.

946
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:50,700
Have any of you had sex
or masturbated in the past 24 hours?

947
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:53,500
Well, I guess I'm out.

948
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:56,500
Because I had sex last night...

949
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:58,500
with a girl! (Grunting)

950
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,700
That's nice.

951
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:05,300
You'll find everything you need
in these binders.

952
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:08,200
Would you each take a cup.

953
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,700
- PK.
- And yours.

954
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:15,100
I'd appreciate it if you'd
return those after you're finished.

955
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,200
OK. Uh, thanks.

956
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,000
Cheers.

957
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:25,900
Excuse me. Do you have anything
with Asian women?

958
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:30,100
I have this thing for Asian chicks,
and there's none here.

959
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,900
This isn't Peep World.
Our selection is limited.

960
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:36,600
- You're gonna have to make do.
- OK.

961
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:39,300
You've been more than helpful.

962
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,500
Is something wrong?

963
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,600
Well, no.

964
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,900
But... I just couldn't help
but notice that...

965
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:55,500
Is there something between us?

966
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:58,800
I mean, I was thinking
that maybe you might want to...

967
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:02,200
I don't know...
help me out with a little...

968
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,100
professional assistance?

969
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:09,200
Do you need some help?

970
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:12,200
Yes, I do.

971
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,300
(Woman on PA)
'Dr Morris, dial 1-1-8, please.

972
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,700
'Dr Morris, please dial 1-1-8.'

973
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:24,800
The moment I saw you out there,
I thought you were incredible.

974
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:29,000
You're not like most of the girls
I know. You're a woman.

975
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:33,800
That's fine. Turn around, drop your
pants, hands flat on the table.

976
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:36,700
(Chuckling) Oh, my God.

977
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:40,000
- This is great. Wow. Like this?
- Exactly.

978
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:46,500
(Sighs) I have to admit,
I love you in that uniform.

979
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:50,800
Do those nylons go all the way up,
or are they, like thigh high?

980
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:54,600
I'm gonna perform a procedure
called milking the prostate.

981
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,900
It's an anally-induced ejaculation.

982
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:59,200
Anal??

983
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:03,800
You're gonna feel strong pressure
from inside your rectum.

984
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:09,400
Come on, you don't have
to get all scientific, baby.

985
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:11,400
I mean, we can just talk...

986
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,300
(Grunts)

987
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,700
(Squeals)

988
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:17,700
(Grunting)

989
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,500
Stop! OK, keep doin' it. Yaaah!

990
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:29,200
(EL) Right there! Ahhh!

991
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,200
(Moans)

992
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,400
Oh, my God! Ohhh!

993
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:39,400
(Sighs)

994
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,700
OK. All done.

995
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:49,300
(Exhales)

996
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:52,400
That was awesome!

997
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:57,300
Wait. Wait. Does that work?

998
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:01,200
I mean,
is it even medically possible?

999
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,900
Oh, yeah, it works.

1000
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:06,000
It works like a charm.

1001
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:10,500
But back to our story.

1002
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:13,200
'It was Sunday morning
back in Ithaca,

1003
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:16,700
'when things suddenly took
an unexpected turn.'

1004
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:21,200
(Barry) I'm a mouse.
I'm a mouse. Eat me. Eat me.

1005
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,900
Eat me. Eat me. Eat me.
Eat me. Eat me.

1006
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:27,500
(Sighs) Come on.

1007
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:31,000
You better eat him, Mitch,
before I do.

1008
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,800
(Panting) He's tasty.

1009
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,100
He's tasty, Mitch. Oh! Oh!

1010
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:40,100
- (Mouse squeaks)
- (Moaning)

1011
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,800
Mmm! Mmm!

1012
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,600
- Mmm! Mmm!
- Why'd you lie to me?

1013
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:01,900
(Gulps) I didn't lie.

1014
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:05,100
You-you told me
that Josh went to Boston.

1015
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:08,300
- I didn't. I said Austin.
- You said Boston.

1016
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:11,800
Because of you,
some guy's life is ruined.

1017
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:16,400
So what?? Besides, wherever he went,
he went because of you.

1018
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:22,000
- What do you mean, because of me?
- Look, it's obvious.

1019
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:25,500
Josh likes you. It's disgusting.

1020
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:28,000
I knew you'd come back.

1021
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:32,000
- What do you want??
- So, how was your getaway with Josh?

1022
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:35,800
- I wasn't with Josh.
- Sure. Doesn't matter, though.

1023
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,500
Cos Josh won't be back next semester.

1024
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:41,100
He's about to flunk philosophy.

1025
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:45,800
- What are you talking about??
- He thinks that he has an extension,

1026
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:51,100
but thanks to
a...certain someone - me -

1027
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,000
he doesn't.

1028
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:56,200
(Jacob) He's an idiot.
(Beth) You psycho.

1029
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:13,700
(Groans)

1030
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:15,100
Oh, my God!

1031
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,300
# I wanna rock

1032
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:23,300
# Turn it down, you say

1033
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:26,200
# All I gotta say to you
time and time again I say no!

1034
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,800
# No, no, no!

1035
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,200
# Tell me not to play

1036
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:34,600
# All I gotta say to you
when you tell me not to play

1037
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:38,600
# I say no, no, no, no

1038
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:44,000
# So if you ask me why
I like the way I play

1039
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:47,500
# There's only one thing
I can say to you

1040
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,700
# I wanna rock! Rock!

1041
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,700
# I wanna rock! Rock!

1042
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:58,700
# I want to rock! Rock... #

1043
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:06,600
(Barry) 'That night I set the guys up
at my grandparents' house.

1044
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:09,200
'I haven't been there in a long time.

1045
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:12,600
'When I was seven years old
I set their dog on fire

1046
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,500
'and wasn't invited back.

1047
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:16,900
'But I hear it's still real nice.'

1048
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:21,000
I'm serious. "Please",
"Thank you", "This is delicious"

1049
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:24,100
are the only words
you're allowed to say.

1050
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:27,800
What?? I'm great with old people.
Grandmas love me.

1051
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,500
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait. "Manilow"?

1052
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,100
- Barry's last name is Manilow?
- Yeah.

1053
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:36,700
- His name is Barry Manilow?
- Yeah.

1054
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:42,100
- (All) Hi!
- Oh, my goodness!

1055
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:45,500
Oh, look at you boys.

1056
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:47,900
Jack, they're here!

1057
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:52,300
# I see you, baby, shakin' that ass

1058
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:55,100
# Shakin' that ass,
shakin' that ass... #

1059
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:58,900
Jack, Barry's friends are here.
Come and say hi.

1060
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:01,500
- (Dog groans)
- The boys are here.

1061
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:05,300
- Oh, hey, fellas.
- Hi.

1062
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,500
- Hey, how's it going?
- Wait. Let me get up.

1063
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:12,300
- I'll give you guys the full tour.
- Oh, honey!

1064
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,500
Careful. Your boner!

1065
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:17,800
Well, what do you want me to do,
cut it off?

1066
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:20,600
(Groans) I'll tell you what, fellas,

1067
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:24,500
we'll start by showin'
you where you're gonna sleep.

1068
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:28,000
(Chuckles) I'll show you
what we call the guest room.

1069
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:32,000
Follow me, boys. The guest room...

1070
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:34,100
Ohhh.

1071
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:37,400
(TV) # Y'all know
what I'm talkin' about

1072
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,000
# Don't be lookin' at me
like that now

1073
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,600
# Come on... #

1074
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:53,200
Excuse me.

1075
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,600
You remember this kid?

1076
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,600
No, sure don't.

1077
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:02,200
(Mutters) Fuckin' airhead.

1078
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,300
Let me ask you once more.
Have you seen my son?

1079
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,600
Ow. Now that you mention it,
there were a few guys in.

1080
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:16,600
If you loosen my arm,
I could get their bill.

1081
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,000
Use your other arm.

1082
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,500
- How many were there?
- A few.

1083
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:29,400
- (Cracking)
- Aaah! Four!

1084
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,100
One of 'em was trying to score drugs.

1085
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:37,300
Honey, look. They made two calls to
Austin, Texas. Maybe they went there.

1086
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:48,900
(Door opens)

1087
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,200
(Grandpa) Havin' a smoke?

1088
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:58,300
Uh...yeah, yeah.

1089
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:02,700
(Groans) I can't sleep, either.

1090
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:06,600
Goddam Viagra
gets my heart racing like a lab rat.

1091
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,800
(Chuckles) Are you OK?

1092
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:13,100
- You look kinda goofy.
- No. No, it's nothing.

1093
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:17,900
- Come on, out with it.
- (Sniffs) OK.

1094
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:22,600
Well... I almost died two days ago.

1095
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:25,000
- What??
- Our car exploded.

1096
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,300
I could be dead right now.

1097
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:33,000
And since that happened,
I find myself asking why.

1098
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:36,400
You know? Like...

1099
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:38,700
What is my reason for living?

1100
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:43,600
Are you gonna
pass that doobie, or what??

1101
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:47,700
Doobie? Yeah. Yeah, sorry.

1102
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:49,800
Uh, thanks.

1103
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:00,400
You know what your problem is?

1104
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:06,000
You're all brains.
Not enough cock and balls.

1105
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:10,200
Actually, uh, people have been
telling me that my whole life.

1106
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:15,500
In the sixth grade I got so worried
about the situation in Iraq,

1107
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:18,400
that I was on
an adult dosage of Xanax.

1108
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:21,900
And by eighth grade,
I was in therapy three times a week.

1109
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:27,500
And the truth is, weed is the
only thing that could balance me out.

1110
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:30,500
You know what I mean? Like...

1111
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:35,000
You PK?

1112
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:37,100
Hey, old man.

1113
01:13:38,300 --> 01:13:41,600
I got the fuckin' munchies real bad.

1114
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,800
(Dog) How 'bout you?

1115
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:51,700
OK, Tiffany,
it's time to stop being so sad.

1116
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,800
Look at all this mail you got!

1117
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,900
Look how many nice people
care about you.

1118
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:02,400
You even got a package from Josh.

1119
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:04,100
Really?

1120
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:06,700
Shall we open it
and see what he says?

1121
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:09,600
Yeah, come on, Tif. Let's open it.

1122
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,100
- (Laughs) It's a tape.
- Oh.

1123
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,400
Well, pop it in.

1124
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:19,100
Maybe I should watch this on my own.

1125
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:21,200
Oh, come on.

1126
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:25,600
This'll definitely cheer you up.

1127
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:34,300
(Beth) 'What do you look for
in a girl?? '

1128
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:39,500
'Well, let's see.
She should be smart...'

1129
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:42,800
- (Giggling)
- 'and, um, funny.

1130
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,300
'And, uh...

1131
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:48,600
'That's good...that's good, too.'

1132
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,700
(Beth) 'What else do you look for?? '

1133
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:55,800
'Um... She should be, uh, attractive.

1134
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:58,900
'And, um, topless.

1135
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:01,900
- 'Uh-huh.'
- 'And she should kiss me.'

1136
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:20,700
(Josh) Bye-bye.
(Grandpa) You boys be good now.

1137
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,700
- Bye-bye.
- I'll tell Barry you said hello.

1138
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,300
Hey, Jack, have that bitch make me
some blueberry pancakes. Now.

back slash...

1152
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:42,200
(Sighs) OK, look.
Some people are here

1153
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,500
and they are being very rude.

1154
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,600
OK. Call you back.

1155
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:49,900
I'm sorry, but we need your help.

1156
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,300
- Do you know Tiffany Henderson?
- Room 109.

1157
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,600
Well, her grandfather died,

1158
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:58,100
and she asked me
to pick up her mail.

1159
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:01,200
Oh, how sad. Do you have the key?

1160
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:07,800
Well, she didn't bring it to the
funeral so I was hoping you could...

1161
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:11,000
Oh, I'm sorry,
but you need the key.

1162
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:14,500
Don't worry. Her mail will be here,
safe and sound.

1163
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,400
It's not like that, you see?
She needs something.

1164
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:24,300
- This is an emergency.
- Don't make a big deal out of it.

1165
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:29,300
Well, it's not a big deal, but
you need the key. Rules are rules.

1166
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:33,700
No one's asking you to do anything
wrong. Just, you know, look away.

1167
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:35,800
Go have an Eskimo pie.

1168
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,300
You guys are gonna have to leave.

1169
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:41,100
We're not leaving without that mail.

1170
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:44,500
Listen to the man before you get
some Jackie Chan on your face.

1171
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:48,000
- Come on, let's go.
- That means now, asshole.

1172
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,100
Jesus!

1173
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,100
I think he broke my nose. Oh, God!

1174
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,900
Come on, Susie.

1175
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:00,700
- You're a wrestler??
- You bet, Mary. You wanna go?

1176
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:02,900
- Let me see it.
- Oh, God!

1177
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:05,000
All right.

1178
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,800
- Who's my bitch?
- What??!

1179
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:16,000
(Groans)

1180
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:20,100
(Receptionist) That's it. No, no, no!

1181
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:28,300
OK, everyone, freeze!

1182
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:31,800
This here is pepper spray,
and we will use it.

1183
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,900
(Groaning)

1184
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:40,800
These guys jumped me.
I was just sitting behind my desk!

1185
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:43,000
Kyle?

1186
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:45,500
- Dad?
- That's your dad?

1187
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:47,800
Freeze now! Everybody freeze!

1188
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,200
Put your weapon down now!

1189
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,200
My son was kidnapped!

1190
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:55,200
Whoa, whoa... Who was kidnapped?

1191
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:58,700
I wasn't kidnapped.
These are my friends from school.

1192
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:01,600
What are you talkin' about??

1193
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,100
We all drove down here together.

1194
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:08,100
What??

1195
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:11,500
Then explain to me how
the frigging car got blown to hell!

1196
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:16,000
- Well, see...
- It was stolen.

1197
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:18,600
That's right. Tell him, Kyle.

1198
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,600
Uh-huh. Exactly.

1199
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,600
Stolen?

1200
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:25,500
What about the damned credit card?

1201
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,000
It was inside,
and that was stolen, too.

1202
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:34,700
Bullcrap! This is ridiculous! Why
didn't you tell us where you were?

1203
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,600
Because I knew you'd get mad! See?

1204
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:41,400
- I'm not mad! You're going with me.
- Josh?

1205
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:46,700
- Tiffany!
- What the... What's going on?

1206
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,800
- Nothing.
- Damn, dude, she is hot!

1207
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:52,200
(Beeping)

1208
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:54,900
My girlfriend's pagin' me.
Can we let them go?

1209
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:57,800
- Good idea.
- No one is going anywhere!

1210
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,500
- He's comin' with me.
- Get off of me!

1211
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:04,000
I'm going back with these guys.

1212
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:06,600
Shut your mouth and don't talk back.

1213
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,200
Why don't YOU shut up?

1214
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:11,000
What the hell did you just say to me?

1215
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:13,100
I said, you shut up.

1216
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:16,400
You've always told me
to stand up for myself.

1217
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:20,300
Well, now I am.
Leave me alone, you jerk!

1218
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:23,800
You ungrateful...

1219
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,800
(Screaming and shouting)

1220
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:30,100
- What...
- Go this way.

1221
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:32,300
Go away! Go away!

1222
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:35,400
- (Alarm ringing)
- (Coughing)

1223
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:39,700
What was that all about?? I mean,
Josh, what are you doing here?

1224
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,200
I just missed you. That's all.

1225
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:47,200
I missed you, too, but it's crazy
for you to drive all the way here.

1226
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:50,200
What??
I thought you'd be glad to see me.

1227
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:55,900
I am. But Josh, you have your
entire life to live up at school.

1228
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:58,800
This isn't healthy. Besides...

1229
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:03,400
I realised a few things
this past week.

1230
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:06,000
You did? Like what??

1231
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:08,400
Like, we're in college.

1232
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:15,000
The window of opportunity to go out
and have fun and meet new people

1233
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:17,900
is getting smaller by the day.

1234
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,200
- It is?
- Come on, Josh.

1235
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:23,400
We've been together forever.

1236
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:27,400
I mean...you're pretty much
the only guy I've ever been with.

1237
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:30,600
What do you mean,
"pretty much the only guy"?

1238
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:34,900
Well, I was 14, and you were away
at camp, but that was years ago.

1239
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:38,000
Besides,
we're in different area codes.

1240
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:44,600
I've been thinking a lot
about us, too.

1241
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,700
(Phone)

1242
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:49,000
The real reason I drove down...

1243
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:51,100
Hold that thought.

1244
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:56,300
Hello?

1245
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,600
Yeah, he's right here.

1246
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,600
Who is this?

1247
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:04,100
Hold on.

1248
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:06,700
It's for you. It's Beth.

1249
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:10,900
Who's Beth?

1250
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:14,000
Uh... (Sighs)

1251
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,500
Beth? What are you doing?

1252
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:23,700
I'm not sure what's going on between
us but I need to tell you something.

1253
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,500
I'm actually glad you called,
cos I wanted to tell you something.

1254
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,200
OK, you first.

1255
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:33,400
I can't really talk right now,

1256
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:36,700
but I'll explain everything
when I get back.

1257
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,300
'OK? Really. I promise.'

1258
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:42,200
Uh, I- I gotta get going, OK?

1259
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:45,700
- Wait! Do you want to hear mine?
- Right. Sorry.

1260
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:47,600
Is it good?

1261
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:50,400
Not really. Jacob lied to you.

1262
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:53,100
There's no extension
on your mid-term.

1263
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:54,700
What??

1264
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:58,600
'He tried to trick you. If you
don't get back you're gonna fail.'

1265
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:00,600
Shit!

1266
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:04,300
'She should be smart and funny.'

1267
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:07,600
- 'Aren't you glad I called? '
- Yes. Thank you.

1268
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:11,500
I'll call you as soon
as I get back, OK? Bye.

1269
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:13,600
- Is this for me?
- Hmm?

1270
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:16,200
Oh, God, no, no, no! You don't...

1271
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:25,600
What the hell is this?

1272
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:29,100
'I can see myself on TV,
I think it must be rewound.'

1273
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:30,900
It's Barry.

1274
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:33,000
'Hey, look...

1275
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:36,500
'Look at that. I can see my bum.
(Laughs)'

1276
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:41,900
Why would you send this to me?

1277
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:46,500
So wait - you guys broke up,
then you hugged and then you left??

1278
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:49,200
Yeah, pretty much.

1279
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:54,000
Loser! Always have sex with the girl
one last time before you break up.

1280
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:56,000
Everyone knows that!

1281
01:23:56,200 --> 01:24:00,700
It's not like that. I've known her
my whole life. She's my best friend.

1282
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,500
So, what do we do now?

1283
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:06,600
- Wanna smoke some drugs?
- I don't think so.

1284
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:11,100
My mid-term starts in exactly
46 hours so I got to get back.

1285
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:14,900
Although I'm gonna fail anyway,
so it doesn't matter but...

1286
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:18,600
- Which class was it??
- Ancient Philosophy.

1287
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:22,200
I can teach you ancient philosophy
in 46 hours.

1288
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:23,900
You can?

1289
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
I can teach a monkey in 46 hours.

1290
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:29,600
You just got to find a way
to relate to the material.

1291
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:33,300
Like, OK...
You like pro wrestling, don't you?

1292
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,200
- Who doesn't??
- OK.

1293
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:38,600
Socrates was like
the Vince McMahon of philosophy.

1294
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:40,600
He started it all.

1295
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:46,100
# Can you hear us
pumpin' on your stereo

1296
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:49,700
# Can you hear us
pumpin' on your stereo

1297
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:52,500
# Life is a cigarette

1298
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,900
# You smoke to the end

1299
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:59,800
# But if you rocket the middle bit

1300
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:02,900
# Then you burn all your friends

1301
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,800
# The wider your eyes,
the bigger the lies

1302
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,200
# Yes, it's true... #

1303
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:12,300
Oh, what was the 20-Man Battle Royal??

1304
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:16,200
Participation explains predication.
Aristotle.

1305
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:17,800
Right.

1306
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:20,500
You know this! You'll be fine.

1307
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:24,700
(Robot beeping)

1308
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:31,300
Freeze, right there! Don't move!

1309
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,400
Is this philosophy?

1310
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:36,300
(Police sirens and radios)

1311
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,800
If you hear anything, give me a call.

1312
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,800
A bomb threat is serious.
Take my card.

1313
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,800
- PK.
- (Sirens wailing)

1314
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,400
(Police radios)

1315
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:50,300
(Cop) OK, let's move it.

1316
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:53,500
What's goin' on
with this bomb threat??

1317
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:56,900
False alarm, people.
Everyone back inside.

1318
01:25:57,200 --> 01:26:00,400
We're gonna do this thing.
That's right.

1319
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:20,300
- Josh.
- Beth!

1320
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:24,400
Hey, um...thanks for calling.

1321
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:28,400
Uh, it's been a really weird week.

1322
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:32,600
So, how'd you do?

1323
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:35,700
On the exam? Pretty good, actually.

1324
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:37,800
- You did?
- Yeah.

1325
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,500
Were you surprised?

1326
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:45,300
You weren't back
in time for the exam,

1327
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:48,300
so I, uh, called in a bomb threat.

1328
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:50,800
You did that??

1329
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:54,300
(Laughs) That's insane.

1330
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:57,500
I wasn't gonna let Jacob
get you kicked out.

1331
01:26:57,700 --> 01:27:01,100
Besides, I might need you
around next semester.

1332
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:04,100
So I did good, right??

1333
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:05,800
Good?

1334
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,900
That's the coolest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

1335
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,200
Mom?

1336
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:31,600
(Panting) I'm so sorry.

1337
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:34,200
Mom?

1338
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:37,100
I got carried away
with the story there.

1339
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:39,600
(Panting)

1340
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:44,300
So, anyway,
Josh got a B+ on his mid-term.

1341
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:46,500
He got to stay in college.

1342
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:48,900
'And he and Beth are still together.

1343
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:52,900
'They're still really into
making their...home movies.

1344
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:57,200
'In fact, they have about 70 hours
of unedited amateur video.'

1345
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:59,300
It's pretty wild.

1346
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:02,300
I know, because I bought some of it.

1347
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:04,200
That guy Jacob?

1348
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:08,600
'He left school. He went on to become
the leader of some cult in Iowa.

1349
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:11,800
'He tried organising a mass suicide.

1350
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:15,000
'Only problem is,
he drank the Kool-Aid first

1351
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:19,200
'and, well, everyone else
just kind of changed their minds.'

1352
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:22,500
Too bad.

1353
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:25,000
As for Rubin... Remember Rubin?

1354
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:29,300
Remember how he claimed that
he was destined for great things?

1355
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,900
(Rubin) The people of Earth need me.

1356
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:33,700
Well, he was right.

1357
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:38,600
Rubin used cross-pollination
to develop a strain of marijuana

1358
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:41,400
that is not only remarkably potent...

1359
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:44,800
but completely undetectable
by any drug tests.

1360
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Oh, my God.

1361
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:50,800
'He was named
High Times' man of the year.'

1362
01:28:52,900 --> 01:28:57,800
As for EL, despite his
swinging philosophy on sexuality,

1363
01:28:58,100 --> 01:29:00,500
he got serious with some girl he met.

1364
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:03,700
And you want me to use two fingers?

1365
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:05,800
'I believe she was pre-med.'

1366
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,800
Did I say two? Better make it three.

1367
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:12,000
Then there's Kyle.

1368
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:15,400
'Kyle and his father
reconciled their differences.'

1369
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:18,200
Hi, Dad. Merry Christmas.

1370
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,400
'He brought his girlfriend home.'

1371
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:23,200
Rhonda, this is my father, Earl.

1372
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:25,400
Dad, this is Rhonda.

1373
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,500
Merry Christmas, Dad.

1374
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:30,000
Come here.

1375
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,700
That's the end of the tour.

1376
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:39,700
I hope you strongly consider becoming
part of the Ithaca tradition,

1377
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,100
as we lead future generations
of young people

1378
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:45,200
forward into the new century.

1379
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:47,800
Thanks a lot. You were great. Thanks.

1380
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,200
- Thank you so much.
- No, it was fun.

1381
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:54,900
I'll see you in the fall.
Thank you. Thank you.

1382
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:57,900
- OK. Thank you.
- I'd like to say thank you.

1383
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:00,300
I mean, uh, that was...

1384
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:02,800
really great.

1385
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,700
Thank you.

1386
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:06,800
Thank you.

1387
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:10,500
Thank you.

1388
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:12,900
Thank you.

1389
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
(Boy) Mom?

1390
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:19,200
Thank you.

1391
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,500
Thank you, Mommy.

1392
01:30:24,700 --> 01:30:26,700
I'm pumping your mommy.

1393
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:33,000
(Grunting and moaning)

1394
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,100
# Goddam right,
it's a beautiful day, uh-huh

1395
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:44,900
# Goddam right,
it's a beautiful day, uh-huh #

1396
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,700
# OK, what is it tonight??

1397
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,700
# Please, please tell me
what the hell is wrong

1398
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,500
# Do you wanna eat, do you
wanna sleep, do you wanna drown?

1399
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:17,700
# Just settle down
