1
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,042
<i>Look down, look down</i>

2
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,283
<i>Don't look them in the eye</i>

3
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,682
<i>Look down, look down</i>

4
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,923
<i>You're here until you die</i>

5
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,526
<i>No God above</i>

6
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,890
<i>And hell alone below</i>

7
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,489
<i>Look down, look down</i>

8
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,962
<i>There's 20 years to go</i>

9
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,964
<i>I've done no wrong</i>

10
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,765
<i>Sweet Jesus, hear my prayer!</i>

11
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,767
<i>Look down, look down</i>

12
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,411
<i>Sweet Jesus doesn't care</i>

13
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,850
<i>I know she'll wait</i>

14
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,924
<i>I know that she'll be true</i>

15
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,483
<i>Look down, look down</i>

16
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,087
<i>They've all forgotten you</i>

17
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,525
<i>When I get free</i>

18
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,604
<i>You won't see me here for dust!</i>

19
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,806
Huh!

20
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,528
<i>Look down, look down</i>

21
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,365
<i>You'll always be a slave</i>

22
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,604
<i>Look down, look down</i>

23
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,606
<i>You're standing in your grave</i>

24
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,044
Retrieve the flag.

25
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,169
<i>Now, Prisoner 24601</i>

26
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,769
<i>Your time is up
And your parole's begun</i>

27
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,683
<i>You know what that means?</i>

28
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,764
<i>Yes. It means I'm free</i>

29
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,690
<i>No. Follow to the letter
Your itinerary</i>

30
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,445
<i>This badge of shame
You'll show it till you die</i>

31
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,921
<i>It warns you're a dangerous man</i>

32
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,970
<i>I stole a loaf of bread</i>

33
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,570
<i>My sister's child
was close to death</i>

34
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,766
<i>And we were starving</i>

35
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,086
<i>You will starve again</i>

36
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,209
<i>Unless you learn
the meaning of the law</i>

37
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,922
<i>I know the meaning
of those 19 years</i>

38
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,369
<i>A slave of the law!</i>

39
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,850
<i>Five years for what you did</i>

40
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,207
<i>The rest because
you tried to run</i>

41
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,166
<i>Yes, 24601</i>

42
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,289
<i>My name is Jean Valjean!</i>

43
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,489
<i>And I'm Javert!</i>

44
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,688
<i>Do not forget my name</i>

45
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,841
<i>Do not forget me</i>

46
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,000
<i>24601</i>

47
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,809
<i>Look down, look down</i>

48
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,168
<i>You'll always be a slave</i>

49
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,323
<i>Look down, look down</i>

50
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,564
<i>You're standing in your grave</i>

51
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,205
<i>Freedom at last
How strange the taste</i>

52
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,441
<i>Never forget the years,
the waste</i>

53
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,771
<i>Nor forgive them
for what they've done</i>

54
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,525
<i>They are the guilty everyone</i>

55
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,004
<i>The day begins
And now let's see</i>

56
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,405
<i>What this new world
Will do for me</i>

57
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,685
Can I help?
A day's work?

58
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,761
Papers.

59
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,287
No work here.

60
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,288
Valjean, as a dangerous
man, you will be on parole forever.

61
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,930
Failure to report
means immediate arrest.

62
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,771
Be in Pontarlier in 30 days.

63
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,645
Follow him.

64
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,683
Let me see your papers.

65
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,371
<i>Monsieur?</i>
Papers.

66
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,323
I'll sleep in the stable.
Please, I'm hungry.

67
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,765
Get out.

68
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,441
Hey!

69
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,370
<i>Come in, sir, for you are weary</i>

70
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,409
<i>And the night is cold out here</i>

71
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,964
<i>Though our lives
are very humble</i>

72
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,564
<i>What we have we have to share</i>

73
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,568
<i>There is wine
here to revive you</i>

74
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,961
<i>There is bread
to make you strong</i>

75
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,562
<i>There's a bed to
rest till morning</i>

76
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:15,363
<i>Rest from pain
And rest from wrong</i>

77
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,165
Bless the food we eat today.

78
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,728
Bless our dear sister
and our honored guest.

79
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,887
Get in there!
Put him down!

80
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,241
Stay there!

81
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,451
Monsignor.

82
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,561
We have your silver.

83
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,288
We caught this man
red-handed.

84
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,169
He had the nerve to
say you gave him this.

85
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,530
<i>That is right</i>

86
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,081
<i>But, my friend,
you left so early</i>

87
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,322
<i>Surely something
slipped your mind</i>

88
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,887
<i>You forgot I gave these also</i>

89
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:44,371
<i>Would you leave
the best behind?</i>

90
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,286
<i>Messieurs, release him</i>

91
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,721
<i>This man has spoken true</i>

92
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,804
<i>I commend you for your duty</i>

93
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,885
<i>Now God's blessing go with you</i>

94
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,120
<i>But remember this, my brother</i>

95
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,681
<i>See in this some higher plan</i>

96
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,930
<i>You must use
this precious silver</i>

97
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:22,210
<i>To become an honest man</i>

98
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,010
<i>By the witness of the martyrs</i>

99
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,041
<i>By the passion and the blood</i>

100
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,561
<i>God has raised
you out of darkness</i>

101
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,044
<i>I have saved your soul for</i>

102
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,460
<i>God</i>

103
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,164
<i>What have I done?
Sweet Jesus, what have I done?</i>

104
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,608
<i>Become a thief in the night
Become a dog on the run</i>

105
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,002
<i>Have I fallen so far
And is the hour so late</i>

106
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,970
<i>That nothing remains
but the cry of my hate?</i>

107
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,884
<i>The cries in the dark
that nobody hears</i>

108
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:25,444
<i>Here where I stand at
the turning of the years</i>

109
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,251
<i>If there's another way to go</i>

110
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,687
<i>I missed it 20 long years ago</i>

111
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,240
<i>My life was a war
that could never be won</i>

112
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,721
<i>They gave me a number
and they murdered Valjean</i>

113
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,525
<i>When they chained me
and left me for dead</i>

114
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,206
<i>Just for stealing
a mouthful of bread</i>

115
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,487
<i>Yet why did I allow this man</i>

116
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,849
<i>To touch my soul
and teach me love?</i>

117
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,207
<i>He treated me like any other</i>

118
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,808
<i>He gave me his trust
He called me brother</i>

119
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,764
<i>My life he claims for God above</i>

120
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,009
<i>Can such things be?</i>

121
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,286
<i>For I had come
to hate the world</i>

122
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,964
<i>This world that
always hated me!</i>

123
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,691
<i>Take an eye for an eye!</i>

124
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,765
<i>Turn your heart into stone!</i>

125
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,640
<i>This is all I have lived for!</i>

126
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:48,683
<i>This is all I have known!</i>

127
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,884
<i>One word from him
and I'd be back</i>

128
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,566
<i>Beneath the lash, upon the rack</i>

129
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,642
<i>Instead he offers me
my freedom!</i>

130
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,049
<i>I feel my shame inside me
like a knife</i>

131
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,005
<i>He told me that I have a soul</i>

132
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,762
<i>How does he know?</i>

133
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,322
<i>What spirit comes
to move my life?</i>

134
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:30,004
<i>Is there another way to go?</i>

135
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,126
<i>I am reaching but I fall</i>

136
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,286
<i>And the night is closing in</i>

137
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,890
<i>As I stare into the void</i>

138
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,330
<i>To the whirlpool of my sin</i>

139
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,327
<i>I'll escape now from that world</i>

140
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,721
<i>From the world of Jean Valjean</i>

141
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,524
<i>Jean Valjean is nothing now!</i>

142
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:05,609
<i>Another story must begin!</i>

143
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,200
<i>At the end
of the day you're another day older</i>

144
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,931
<i>And that's all you can say
for the life of the poor</i>

145
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,682
<i>It's a struggle! It's a war!</i>

146
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,728
<i>And there's nothing
that anyone's giving</i>

147
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,371
<i>One more day standing about
What is it for?</i>

148
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,884
<i>One day less to be living</i>

149
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,931
<i>At the end of the day
you're another day colder</i>

150
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,886
<i>And the shirt on your back
doesn't keep out the chill</i>

151
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,845
<i>And the righteous hurry past They
don't hear the little ones crying</i>

152
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,163
<i>And the plague is coming
on fast Ready to kill</i>

153
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,690
<i>One day nearer to dying!</i>

154
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,011
<i>At the end of the day
there's another day dawning</i>

155
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,851
<i>And the sun in the morning
is waiting to rise</i>

156
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,729
<i>Like the waves
crash on the sand</i>

157
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,763
<i>Like a storm
that'll break any second</i>

158
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,765
<i>There's a hunger in the land There's
a reckoning still to be reckoned</i>

159
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,528
<i>And there's gonna be hell to
pay At the end of the day!</i>

160
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,806
<i>At the end of the day
you get nothing for nothing</i>

161
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,050
<i>Sitting flat on your bum
doesn't buy any bread</i>

162
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,563
<i>There are children back at home</i>

163
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,569
<i>And the children
have got to be fed</i>

164
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,245
<i>And you're lucky to be in a job</i>

165
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,010
<i>And in a bed</i>

166
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,043
<i>And we're counting
our blessings</i>

167
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,364
<i>Have you seen how the
foreman is fuming today</i>

168
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,244
<i>With his terrible breath
and his wandering hands?</i>

169
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,362
<i>It's because tittie Fantine
won't give him his way</i>

170
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,601
<i>Take a look at his trousers
You'll see where he stands!</i>

171
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,970
<i>And the boss, he never knows that
the foreman is always on heat</i>

172
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,964
<i>If Fantine doesn't look out,
watch how she goes</i>

173
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,203
<i>She'll be out on the street</i>

174
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,166
<i>At the end of
the day it's another day over</i>

175
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,210
<i>With enough in your pocket
to last for a week</i>

176
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,685
<i>Pay the landlord, pay the shop Keep
on working as long as you're able</i>

177
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,526
<i>Keep on working till you drop Or it's
back to the crumbs off the table</i>

178
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,606
<i>Well, you've got to pay your
way At the end of the day!</i>

179
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,928
<i>And what have we here,
little innocent sister?</i>

180
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,926
<i>Come on, Fantine,
let's have all the news</i>

181
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,369
<i>"Dear Fantine,
you must send us more money"</i>

182
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,410
<i>"Your child needs a doctor
There's no time to lose"</i>

183
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,522
<i>Give that letter to me
It is none of your business</i>

184
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,164
<i>With a husband at home
and a bit on the side</i>

185
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,720
<i>Is there anyone here
who can swear before God</i>

186
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,842
<i>She has nothing to fear?
She has nothing to hide?</i>

187
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,763
Stop making trouble.
I'm not making trouble.

188
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,126
Foreman!

189
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,611
What are you doing?

190
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,248
Come on, stop that!
<i>Monsieur</i> Madeleine is here!

191
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,691
<i>What is this fighting all about?
Someone tear these two apart!</i>

192
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,728
<i>This is a factory, not a circus</i>

193
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,164
<i>Now, come on, ladies,
settle down</i>

194
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,410
<i>I am the mayor of this town</i>

195
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,721
<i>I run a business of repute</i>

196
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,162
Deal with this, Foreman.
Be as patient as you can.

197
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,046
Yes, <i>Monsieur</i> Madeleine.

198
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,682
Now, someone say
how this began.

199
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,524
<i>At the end of the day
she's the one who began it!</i>

200
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,125
<i>There's a kid that she's
hiding in some little town</i>

201
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,089
<i>There's a man she has to pay</i>

202
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,162
<i>You can guess how
she picks up the extra</i>

203
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,851
<i>You can bet she's earning
her keep sleeping around!</i>

204
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,001
<i>And the boss wouldn't like it</i>

205
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,170
<i>Yes, it's true there's a child
And the child is my daughter</i>

206
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,524
<i>And her father abandoned
us, leaving us flat</i>

207
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,683
<i>Now she lives with an
innkeeper man and his wife</i>

208
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,041
<i>And I pay for the child
What's the matter with that?</i>

209
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,606
<i>At the end of the day
she'll be nothing but trouble</i>

210
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,650
<i>And there's trouble for all
when there's trouble for one</i>

211
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,169
<i>While we're earning
our daily bread</i>

212
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,169
<i>She's the one with
her hands in the butter</i>

213
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,926
<i>You must send the slut away or we're
all going to end in the gutter</i>

214
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,961
<i>And it's us who'll have to pay
At the end of the day!</i>

215
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,008
<i>I might have known
the bitch could bite</i>

216
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,162
<i>I might have known
the cat had claws</i>

217
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,767
<i>I might have guessed
your little secret</i>

218
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:12,643
<i>Ah, yes, the virtuous Fantine who
keeps herself so pure and clean</i>

219
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,567
<i>You'd be the cause, I had no
doubt of any trouble hereabout</i>

220
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,608
<i>You play a virgin in the light</i>

221
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,609
<i>But need no urging in the night</i>

222
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,484
<i>She's been laughing at
you while she's having her men!</i>

223
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,483
<i>She'll be nothing
but trouble again and again!</i>

224
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,286
<i>You must sack her today!
Sack the girl today!</i>

225
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,689
<i>Right, my girl On your way</i>

226
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,004
<i>Monsieur le Maven
Monsieur le Maven!</i>

227
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,127
<i>Monsieur le Mayor!</i>

<i>Monsieur le Maven

Please!
Please, <i>monsieur!</i>

230
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,163
I have a child!
<i>Monsieur!</i>

231
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,606
Please! Please.

232
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,128
Welcome, Inspector.

233
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,443
<i>Monsieur le Mayor.</i>

234
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,851
<i>Please know me as Javert</i>

235
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,048
<i>I'm here at your command</i>

236
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,046
<i>With honor due to each
And justice in our hand</i>

237
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,329
<i>No man's beyond our reach</i>

238
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,640
<i>Let all beware</i>

239
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,842
<i>Welcome, sir
Come guard our laws</i>

240
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,447
<i>I'm sure we're here
In common cause</i>

241
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,602
<i>You've done the city proud</i>

242
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,240
<i>You're praised by those on high</i>

243
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,562
<i>Your success has earned a force</i>

244
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,246
<i>The best that Paris can supply</i>

245
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,730
<i>Your people thrive</i>

246
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:51,043
<i>The dignity of toil
To stay alive</i>

247
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,648
<i>It seems to me we may have met</i>

248
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,686
<i>Your face is not a face
I would forget</i>

249
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,964
<i>Monsieur Madeleine!
Pardon.</i>

250
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,690
<i>Monsieur le Mayor!</i>

251
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,330
<i>Monsieur le Mayor!</i>

252
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,164
The weight, it's crushing him!

253
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,571
Stay still, stay still.

254
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,807
Hold, hold, hold!
Hold that steady.

255
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,204
Hold it steady!

256
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,050
That's it. That's it.

257
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:50,041
<i>Can this be true?
I don't believe what I see</i>

258
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,250
<i>A man your age
To be as strong as you are</i>

259
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,290
<i>A memory stirs</i>

260
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,966
<i>You make me think of a man</i>

261
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,608
<i>From years ago</i>

262
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,690
<i>A man who broke his parole</i>

263
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,129
<i>He disappeared</i>

264
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,011
<i>Say what you must
Don't leave it there</i>

265
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,641
<i>Forgive me, sir
I would not dare</i>

266
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,611
How much for this?
It's my daughter's.

267
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,325
I'll give you
four francs for that.

268
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,720
Four? It's worth 10!

269
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,281
No.

270
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,966
<i>I smell women
Smell 'em in the air</i>

271
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,123
<i>Think I'll drop my anchor
In that harbor over there</i>

272
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,201
Five?

273
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,124
<i>Lovely lady
I'll love you till I'm broke</i>

274
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,250
<i>Seven months at sea
and now I'm hungry for a poke!</i>

275
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,603
<i>Even stokers
need a little stoke!</i>

276
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,491
<i>Lovely ladies
Waiting for a bite!</i>

277
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,484
<i>Waiting for the customers
Who only come at night</i>

278
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,484
<i>Lovely ladies
Ready for the call</i>

279
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,803
<i>Standing up or lying down
Or any way at all</i>

280
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,049
<i>Bargain prices
up against the wall!</i>

281
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,369
<i>What pretty hair!</i>

282
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,524
<i>What pretty locks
you've got there!</i>

283
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,488
<i>What luck you've got It's
worth a centime, my dear!</i>

284
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,488
<i>I'll take the lot!</i>

285
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,206
<i>Don't touch me!
Leave me alone!</i>

286
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,683
<i>Let's make a price</i>

287
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,524
<i>I'll give you all of 10 francs</i>

288
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,849
<i>Just think of that</i>

289
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,404
<i>It pays a debt</i>

290
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,688
<i>Just think of that</i>

291
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,691
<i>What can I do?
It pays a debt</i>

292
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,401
<i>Ten francs may
save my poor Cosette</i>

293
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,851
<i>Lovely ladies
Waiting in the dark</i>

294
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,685
<i>Ready for a thick one
Or a quick one in the park</i>

295
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,929
<i>Long time, short time
Any time, my dear!</i>

296
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,970
<i>Costs a little extra
If you want to take all year</i>

297
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,120
<i>Quick and cheap
is underneath the pier</i>

298
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,725
Go and see them.

299
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,369
Come over here

300
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,166
<i>It's 20 francs for a tooth</i>

301
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,403
<i>Come here, my dear</i>

302
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,961
<i>I'll pay you well
for your youth</i>

303
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,768
<i>The pain won't last
You'll still be able to bite</i>

304
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,401
Just the back ones.

305
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,405
<i>I do it fast
I know my business all right</i>

306
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,288
<i>It's worth a go</i>

307
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,484
<i>You'll pay me first
what I am due</i>

308
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,086
<i>You'll get twice if I take two</i>

309
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,690
<i>Give me the dirt
Who's that bit over there?</i>

310
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,411
<i>A bit of skirt
She's the one sold her hair</i>

311
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,764
<i>She's got a kid
Sends her all that she can</i>

312
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,491
<i>I might have known
There is always some man</i>

313
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,849
<i>Lovely lady,
come along and join us!</i>

314
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,002
<i>Lovely lady!</i>

315
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,723
<i>Come on, dearie,
why all the fuss?</i>

316
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,602
<i>You're no grander
than the rest of us</i>

317
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,527
<i>Life has dropped you
at the bottom of the heap</i>

318
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,966
<i>Join your sisters</i>

319
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,646
<i>Make money in your sleep</i>

320
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:36,128
<i>That's right, dearie
Show him what you've got</i>

321
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:41,840
<i>That's right, dearie
Let him have the lot</i>

322
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,484
<i>Old men, young
men Take 'em as they come!</i>

323
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,564
<i>Harbor rats and alley cats
and every kind of scum</i>

324
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,690
<i>Poor men, rich men,
leaders of the land</i>

325
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,889
<i>See them with their trousers off
They're never quite as grand!</i>

326
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,283
<i>All it takes is
money in your hand</i>

327
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:08,404
<i>Lovely ladies Going for a song</i>

328
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:14,203
<i>Got a lot of callers
But they never stay for long</i>

329
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:25,166
<i>Come on, Captain
You can wear your shoes</i>

330
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,802
<i>Don't it make a change to
have a girl who can't refuse?</i>

331
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,728
<i>Easy money Lying on a bed</i>

332
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:41,687
<i>Just as well they never see
The hate that's in your head</i>

333
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:50,043
<i>Don't they know they're making
love to one already dead?</i>

334
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,724
<i>There was a time
when men were kind</i>

335
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,125
<i>When their voices were soft</i>

336
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,924
<i>And their words inviting</i>

337
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,645
<i>There was a time
when love was blind</i>

338
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,810
<i>And the world was a song</i>

339
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,768
<i>And the song was exciting</i>

340
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,766
<i>There was a time</i>

341
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,443
<i>Then it all went wrong</i>

342
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:21,002
<i>I dreamed a dream
in time gone by</i>

343
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,646
<i>When hope was high
And life worth living</i>

344
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:37,089
<i>I dreamed that
love would never die</i>

345
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:42,641
<i>I dreamed that God
would be forgiving</i>

346
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:52,490
<i>Then I was young and unafraid</i>

347
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:59,805
<i>And dreams were made
and used and wasted</i>

348
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:08,450
<i>There was no ransom to be paid</i>

349
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,010
<i>No song unsung,
no wine untasted</i>

350
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:23,521
<i>But the tigers come at night</i>

351
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:31,560
<i>With their voices
soft as thunder</i>

352
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:38,882
<i>As they tear your hope apart</i>

353
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:47,889
<i>As they turn
your dream to shame</i>

354
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,201
<i>He slept a summer by my side</i>

355
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:09,042
<i>He filled my days
with endless wonder</i>

356
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:17,920
<i>He took my childhood
in his stride</i>

357
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,371
<i>But he was gone
when autumn came</i>

358
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:34,246
<i>And still I dream
he'll come to me</i>

359
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:39,566
<i>That we will live
the years together</i>

360
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:47,368
<i>But there are dreams
that cannot be</i>

361
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,765
<i>And there are storms
we cannot weather</i>

362
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,408
<i>I had a dream my life would be</i>

363
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,969
<i>So different from
this hell I'm living</i>

364
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:15,083
<i>So different now
from what it seemed!</i>

365
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,565
<i>Now</i>

366
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:28,489
<i>Life has killed the dream</i>

367
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,532
<i>I dreamed</i>

368
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,890
Have you anywhere to go?
No? You need to get warm.

369
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,480
What do you have for me?

370
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,361
Here's our youngest, sir.

371
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,885
<i>I don't want you</i>

372
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,043
You've got some nerve, you little slut.
You've got some gall.

373
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,081
Ow!

374
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,320
<i>By Christ, you'll
pay for what you've done</i>

375
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,091
<i>I guarantee
I'll make you suffer</i>

376
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,605
<i>I beg you, don't report me, sir</i>

377
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,131
<i>I'll do whatever you may want</i>

378
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,531
<i>Make your excuse to the police</i>

379
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,482
<i>Tell me quickly
what's the story</i>

380
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,722
<i>Who saw what and why and where?</i>

381
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,885
<i>Let him give a full description
Let him answer to Javert</i>

382
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,810
<i>Javert, would you believe it?
I was lost here in the dark</i>

383
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,171
<i>When this prostitute attacked me
You can see she left her mark</i>

384
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,768
<i>She will answer for her actions
If you make a full report</i>

385
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,564
<i>You may rest assured, monsieur
She will answer to the court</i>

386
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,326
<i>There's a child
who sorely needs me</i>

387
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,324
<i>Please, monsieur,
she's but that high</i>

388
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,530
<i>Holy God, is there no mercy?</i>

389
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,044
<i>If I go to jail she'll die</i>

390
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:24,166
<i>I have heard such protestations
every day for 20 years</i>

391
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,527
<i>Let's have no more explanations</i>

392
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,046
<i>Save your breath,
save your tears</i>

393
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,966
<i>Honest work, just reward</i>

394
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,681
<i>That's the way
to please the Lord</i>

395
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,525
<i>A moment of your time, Javert
I do believe this woman's tale</i>

396
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,284
<i>Monsieur le Mayor!</i>

397
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,731
<i>You've done your duty,
let her be</i>

398
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,529
<i>She needs a doctor, not a jail</i>

399
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,170
<i>Monsieur le Mayor!</i>

400
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,163
<i>Can this be?</i>

401
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,490
<i>Where will she end</i>

402
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,562
<i>This child without a friend?</i>

403
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,800
<i>I've seen your face before</i>

404
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,484
<i>Show me some way to help you</i>

405
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:19,524
<i>How have you come to grief
In such a place as this?</i>

406
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,161
<i>Monsieur,
don't mock me now, I pray</i>

407
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,761
<i>It's hard enough
I've lost my pride</i>

408
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:40,645
<i>You let your foreman
send me away</i>

409
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,284
<i>Yes, you were there
And turned aside</i>

410
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,367
<i>I never did no wrong</i>

411
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,250
<i>Is it true what I've done...</i>

412
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,170
<i>My daughter's close to dying</i>

413
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,288
<i>...to an innocent soul?</i>

414
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,370
<i>If there's a God above...</i>

415
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,205
<i>Had I only known then</i>

416
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,843
<i>...he'd let me die instead</i>

417
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:21,367
<i>In His name
my task has just begun</i>

418
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,001
I will take her
to the hospital.

419
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,366
Monsieur le Mayor.

420
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,050
Where is your child?

421
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,162
With an innkeeper
in Montfermeil.

422
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,328
I will send for her
immediately.

423
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,884
<i>I will see it done!</i>

424
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,401
Rest.

425
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,883
<i>From Paris, monsieur.</i>

426
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,685
<i>Monsieur le Mayor,
I have a crime to declare!</i>

427
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:10,568
<i>I have disgraced
The uniform that I wear</i>

428
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,770
<i>I've done you wrong
Let no forgiveness be shown</i>

429
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,771
<i>I've been as hard
On every rogue I have known</i>

430
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:25,000
<i>I mistook you for a convict
I have made a false report</i>

431
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,524
<i>Now I learn they caught the culprit
He's about to face the court</i>

432
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,690
<i>And of course he now denies
it You'd expect that of a con</i>

433
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:38,801
<i>But he couldn't run forever
No, not even Jean Valjean</i>

434
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,689
<i>You say this man denies it all</i>

435
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,321
<i>And gives no sign of
understanding or repentance?</i>

436
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,050
<i>You say this man
is going to trial</i>

437
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,646
<i>And that he's sure to be
returned to serve his sentence?</i>

438
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:56,483
<i>He will pay, and so must I</i>

439
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,203
<i>Press charges against me, sir</i>

440
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,405
<i>You have only done your duty</i>

441
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,325
<i>It's a minor sin at most</i>

442
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,166
<i>All of us have
made misjudgments</i>

443
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,926
<i>You'll return, sir,
to your post</i>

444
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:31,848
<i>They think that man is me
Without a second glance</i>

445
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,483
<i>This stranger they have found
This man could be my chance</i>

446
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,601
<i>Why should I save his hide?
Why should I right this wrong?</i>

447
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,368
<i>When I have come so far
and struggled for so long?</i>

448
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,449
<i>If I speak, I am condemned</i>

449
00:37:54,360 --> 00:38:00,845
<i>If I stay silent, I am damned!</i>

450
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,321
<i>I am the master of
hundreds of workers</i>

451
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,528
<i>They all look to me</i>

452
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:11,526
<i>Can I abandon them? How would
they live if I am not free?</i>

453
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,887
<i>If I speak, they are condemned</i>

454
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,367
<i>If I stay silent</i>

455
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,887
<i>I am damned</i>

456
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,882
<i>Who am I?</i>

457
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,566
<i>Can I condemn
this man to slavery?</i>

458
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,731
<i>Pretend I do not
feel his agony?</i>

459
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,208
<i>This innocent who bears my face</i>

460
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,448
<i>Who goes to judgment
in my place</i>

461
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,641
<i>Who am I?</i>

462
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,085
<i>Can I conceal
myself forevermore?</i>

463
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,602
<i>Pretend I'm not
the man I was before?</i>

464
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,086
<i>And must my name until I die
be no more than an alibi?</i>

465
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,607
<i>Must I lie?</i>

466
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,082
<i>How can I ever
face my fellow men?</i>

467
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,647
<i>How can I ever
face myself again?</i>

468
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:19,642
<i>My soul belongs to God, I know
I made that bargain long ago</i>

469
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,770
<i>He gave me hope
when hope was gone</i>

470
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:28,884
<i>He gave me
strength to journey on!</i>

471
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,566
<i>Who am I?</i>

472
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,888
<i>Who am I?</i>

473
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,087
<i>I'm Jean Valjean</i>

474
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,730
<i>Monsieur le Mayor!</i>

475
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,925
<i>And so,
Your Honor, you see it's true</i>

476
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:52,211
<i>This man bears
no more guilt than you!</i>

477
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,761
<i>Who am I?</i>

478
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:56,820
<i>24601!</i>

479
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,967
<i>Monsieur</i> le Mayor,
you are not well.

480
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,121
You must come with me.

481
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,805
If you don't believe me,
ask Inspector Javert.

482
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,410
You'll find me at the hospital.

483
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:32,842
<i>Cosette, it's turned so cold</i>

484
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:41,809
<i>Cosette, it's past your bedtime</i>

485
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,564
<i>You've played the day away</i>

486
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:56,729
<i>And soon it will be night</i>

487
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:03,206
<i>Come to me</i>

488
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:08,690
<i>Cosette, the light is fading</i>

489
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,728
<i>Don't you see</i>

490
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,330
<i>The evening star appearing?</i>

491
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,361
<i>Come to me</i>

492
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:31,207
<i>And rest against my shoulder</i>

493
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:39,491
<i>How fast the minutes fly away
and every minute colder</i>

494
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:47,687
<i>Dear Fantine,
Cosette will be here soon</i>

495
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:54,850
<i>Dear Fantine,
she will be by your side</i>

496
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,567
<i>Come, Cosette</i>

497
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,046
<i>My child, where did you go?</i>

498
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,090
<i>Be at peace</i>

499
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,966
<i>Be at peace evermore</i>

500
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,400
<i>My Cosette</i>

501
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,121
<i>Shall live in my protection</i>

502
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,724
<i>Take her now</i>

503
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,568
<i>Your child will
want for nothing</i>

504
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:39,169
<i>Good monsieur,
you come from God in heaven</i>

505
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:48,484
<i>Tell Cosette I love her</i>

506
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:57,769
<i>And I'll see her when I wake</i>

507
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:26,207
<i>Valjean, at last
We see each other plain</i>

508
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:32,686
<i>"Monsieur le Mayor"
You'll wear a different chain</i>

509
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,690
<i>Before you say
another word, Javert</i>

510
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,008
<i>Before you chain me up
like a slave again</i>

511
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:43,050
<i>Listen to me!
There is something I must do</i>

512
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,571
<i>This woman leaves
behind a suffering child</i>

513
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,564
<i>There is none but me
who can intercede</i>

514
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,248
<i>In mercy's name,
three days are all I need</i>

515
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,611
<i>Then I'll return,
I pledge my word</i>

516
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,807
<i>Then I'll return</i>

517
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,405
<i>You must think me mad</i>

518
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,644
<i>I've hunted you
across the years</i>

519
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,447
<i>Men like you can never change</i>

520
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:13,885
<i>A man such as you!</i>

521
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,050
<i>Believe of me what you will</i>

522
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,571
<i>Men like you can never change</i>

523
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,960
<i>There is a duty I'm sworn to do</i>

524
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,320
<i>Men like me can never change</i>

525
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,084
<i>You know nothing of my life</i>

526
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,844
<i>No, 24601!</i>

527
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,047
<i>All I did was steal some bread</i>

528
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,207
<i>My duty is to the law</i>

529
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,520
<i>You know nothing of the world</i>

530
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,801
<i>You have no rights</i>

531
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,325
<i>You would sooner see me dead</i>

532
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,765
<i>Come with me, 24601!</i>

533
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,440
<i>But not before
I see this justice done!</i>

534
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,720
<i>Now the wheel has turned around</i>

535
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,491
<i>Jean Valjean means nothing now</i>

536
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,926
<i>Dare you talk to me of crime</i>

537
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,411
<i>I am warning you, Javert</i>

538
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,681
<i>And the price you had to pay</i>

539
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,881
<i>I'm the stronger man by far!</i>

540
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,240
<i>Every man is born in sin</i>

541
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,566
<i>There is power in me yet!</i>

542
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,131
<i>Every man must choose his way</i>

543
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,605
<i>My race is not yet run!</i>

544
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,206
<i>You know nothing of Javert!</i>

545
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,011
<i>I was born inside a jail!</i>

546
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,731
<i>I was born with scum like you!</i>

547
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:00,003
<i>I am from the gutter, too!</i>

548
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:29,448
<i>There is a castle on a cloud</i>

549
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:34,288
<i>I like to go there in my sleep</i>

550
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,923
<i>Aren't any floors
for me to sweep</i>

551
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:43,404
<i>Not in my castle on a cloud</i>

552
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,771
<i>There is a lady all in white</i>

553
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:51,481
<i>Holds me and sings a lullaby</i>

554
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,083
<i>She's nice to see
and she's soft to touch</i>

555
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:01,883
<i>She says, "Cosette,
I love you very much"</i>

556
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:06,887
<i>I know a place
where no one's lost</i>

557
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:11,568
<i>I know a place
where no one cries</i>

558
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:16,521
<i>Crying at all is not allowed</i>

559
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:22,005
<i>Not in my castle on a cloud</i>

560
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,611
<i>Now look who's here!</i>

561
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:27,441
<i>The little madam herself</i>

562
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:33,206
<i>Pretending once again
she's been so awfully good</i>

563
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:37,287
<i>Better not let me catch you slacking!
Better not catch my eye!</i>

564
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:41,361
<i>Ten rotten francs your mother sends
me What is that going to buy?</i>

565
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,731
<i>Now take that pail
My little mademoiselle</i>

566
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,201
<i>And go and draw
some water from the well</i>

567
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,202
<i>We should never have taken
you in in the first place</i>

568
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,770
<i>How stupid
the things that we do!</i>

569
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,880
<i>Like mother, like daughter,
the scum of the street</i>

570
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,521
Mama!

571
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,046
<i>Eponine, come, my
dear Eponine, let me see you</i>

572
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,567
<i>You look very well in
that little blue hat</i>

573
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,761
Oh.

574
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,168
<i>There's some little girls
who know how to behave</i>

575
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,767
<i>And they know what to wear And I'm
saying thank heaven for that!</i>

576
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:18,560
<i>Still there, Cosette? Your
tears will do you no good!</i>

577
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:23,084
<i>I told you, fetch some water
from the well in the wood</i>

578
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:27,643
<i>Please do not send me out alone</i>

579
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:31,163
<i>Not in the darkness on my own</i>

580
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:34,449
<i>Now shut your face or
I'll forget to be nice!</i>

581
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:39,489
<i>You heard me ask for something
And I never ask twice</i>

582
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,602
Wakey-wakey, we're opening.

583
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,560
I love you.
I love you so much.

584
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,281
<i>My band of soaks</i>

585
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,730
<i>My den of dissolutes</i>

<i>My dirty jokes</i>

587
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:06,641

<i>Spend their lives in my inn</i>

00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,571
<i>They fly through my doors</i>

595
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,731
<i>And they crawl out on all fours</i>

596
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,041
Daddy, here.

597
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,725
Thank you, darling.

598
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,450
Such a gentleman.

00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,922
<i>Welcome, monsieur,

<i>Jesus!
It's amazing how it grows</i>

Mademoiselle. Can I help
you with your bucket?

673
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:26,966
Whoa!

674
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,725
<i>I found her

00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,051
I love you.

681
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,360
<i>This is a duty I must heed</i>

682
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,922
<i>And there is
a promise I have made</i>

683
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:13,449
<i>For I was blind to one in need</i>

684

<i>And I stand here in her place</i>

Come on.

690
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:52,644
<i>And from this day, and evermore</i>

<i>Take a drink</i>

696
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,090

<i>Cosette shall have a father now</i>

698
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:19,570
<i>What to do?
What to say?</i>

699
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:23,645
<i>Shall you carry
our treasure away?</i>

700
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:27,526
<i>What a gem!
What a pearl!</i>

701
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:30,883
<i>Beyond rubles is
our little girl</i>

702
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:35,446
<i>How can we talk of debt?</i>

703
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:40,885
<i>Let's not haggle
for darling Colette</i>

704
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,087
Cosette.
<i>Cosette</i>

705
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:47,684
<i>Dear Fantine, gone to rest</i>

706
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:50,241
<i>Have we done for her
child what is best?</i>

707
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,481
I think so.

708
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:55,486
<i>Shared our bread,
shared each bone</i>

709
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:58,610
<i>Treated her like
she's one of our own</i>

710
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,000
Yes, our own.

711
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,406
<i>Like our own, monsieur!</i>

712
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,721
The cost adds up.

713
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:05,446
<i>Your feelings do
you credit, sir</i>

714
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:08,131
<i>And I will ease
the parting blow</i>

715
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:12,444
<i>Let us not talk of bargains
and bones and greed</i>

716
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:17,365
<i>Now may I say we are agreed?</i>

717
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:22,211
<i>That would quite fit the bill</i>

718
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:25,967
<i>If she hadn't so often been ill</i>

719
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:29,727
<i>Little dear, cost us dear</i>

720
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:33,168
<i>Medicines are expensive,
monsieur</i>

721
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,802
<i>Not that we begrudged a sou</i>

722
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,611
<i>It's no more than
we Christians must do</i>

723
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,485
<i>Than we Christians may do</i>

724
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:48,007
<i>No more words!
Here's your price</i>

725
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,084
<i>Fifteen hundred
for your sacrifice</i>

726
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:55,522
<i>Come, Cosette, say goodbye</i>

727
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:59,247
<i>Let us seek out
some friendlier sky</i>

728
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:03,282
<i>Thank you, both, for Cosette</i>

729
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:07,280
<i>It won't take you
too long to forget</i>

730
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,364
Farewell, Courgette!

731
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,204
It's "Cosette."
Cosette.

732
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,442
And, open.

733
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,401
It's for you.

734
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,011
<i>Where I go, you will be</i>

735
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,843
<i>Will you be like a papa to me?</i>

736
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,689
<i>Yes, Cosette This is true</i>

737
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:33,888
<i>I'll be father
and mother to you</i>

738
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,565
Not bad.
Not enough!

739
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:45,167
<i>There's a copper at the door
What the devil have you done?</i>

740
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:47,721
Where's the child Cosette?

741
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,121
<i>She's gone with a gent</i>

742
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,680
<i>Didn't tell us where they went</i>

743
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:57,161
<i>Didn't leave his home address</i>

744
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,401
<i>You're a bloody fool
Look at what we got</i>

745
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:07,370
<i>Should've struck the iron
Struck it while it's hot!</i>

746
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,524
<i>Next time round, I promise
I'm gonna get the lot</i>

747
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:11,681
<i>Okay?</i>

748
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,889
<i>Suddenly you're here</i>

749
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,486
<i>Suddenly it starts</i>

750
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:34,927
<i>Can two anxious hearts
beat as one?</i>

751
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,691
<i>Yesterday I was alone</i>

752
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:43,287
<i>Today you are beside me</i>

753
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:47,125
<i>Something still unclear</i>

754
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:52,650
<i>Something not yet here
has begun</i>

755
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:03,843
<i>Suddenly the world
seems a different place</i>

756
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:08,609
<i>Somehow full of grace
Full of light</i>

757
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,800
<i>How was I to know
that so much hope</i>

758
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,645
<i>Was held inside me?</i>

759
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,491
<i>What is passed is gone</i>

760
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:27,170
<i>Now we journey on
through the night</i>

761
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:33,844
<i>How was I to know at last That
happiness can come so fast?</i>

762
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,765
<i>Trusting me the way you do</i>

763
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:39,844
<i>I'm so afraid of failing you</i>

764
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,689
<i>Just a child who cannot know
That danger follows where I go</i>

765
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,650
<i>There are shadows everywhere</i>

766
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:53,169
<i>And memories I cannot share</i>

767
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:56,840
<i>Nevermore alone</i>

768
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,525
<i>Nevermore apart</i>

769
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:04,969
<i>You have warmed my heart
like the sun</i>

770
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:14,883
<i>You have brought the gift of
life And love so long denied me</i>

771
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:19,170
<i>Suddenly I see</i>

772
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:23,487
<i>What I could not see</i>

773
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:27,969
<i>Something suddenly</i>

774
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:29,652
<i>Has begun</i>

775
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:46,888
Halt!
Let's see your papers.

776
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,324
Where are you traveling?

777
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,124
Cosette. Cosette.

778
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:56,889
Give me the doll.

779
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,160
Come.

780
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,006
Valjean!

781
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:20,726
Come, Cosette.
Come quickly!

782
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,891
Come on.

783
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,565
24601!

784
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,766
Cosette. I've got you.
Come, come.

785
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:07,847
Valjean!

786
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,200
Who's there?

787
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,004
Please, monsieur.

788
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:47,367
I need your help.

789
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,488
Please, please.

790
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,521
<i>Monsieur le Mayor?</i>

791

792
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,370
Fauchelevent.

793
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:01,771
I fell under my cart.

794
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,371
You saved my life, monsieur.

795
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,090
Fauchelevent.

796
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:08,006
We need a place of sanctuary,
this child and I.

797
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,049
We need to disappear.

798
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:14,171
<i>We'll give thanks

<i>Here our lives can start again</i>

803
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:56,802
<i>There, out in the darkness</i>

804
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:00,646
<i>A fugitive running</i>

805
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:04,247
<i>Fallen from God</i>

<i>God be my witness</i>

808
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:15,363
<i>I never shall yield</i>

809
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,569

<i>Mine is the way of the Lord</i>

813
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,721
<i>Those who follow
the path of the righteous</i>

814
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:37,726
<i>Shall have their reward</i>

815
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:41,601
<i>And if they fall
as Lucifer fell</i>

816
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:46,687
<i>The flames! The sword!</i>

817
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:53,489
<i>Stars in your multitudes</i>

818
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:56,964
<i>Scarce to be counted</i>

819
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:01,008
<i>Filling the darkness</i>

820
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:04,721
<i>With order and light</i>

821
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:08,242
<i>You are the sentinels</i>

822
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,051
<i>Silent and sure</i>

823
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:13,931
<i>Keeping watch in the night</i>

824
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,322
<i>Keeping watch in the night</i>

825
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:22,008
<i>You know your place in the sky</i>

826
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:25,050
<i>You hold your course
and your aim</i>

827
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:29,205
<i>And each in your season
returns and returns</i>

828
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:33,086
<i>And is always the same</i>

829
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:37,126
<i>And if you fall as Lucifer fell</i>

830
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:41,604
<i>You fall in flames!</i>

831
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:46,129
<i>And so it must be,
for so it is written</i>

832
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:49,363
<i>On the doorway to paradise</i>

833
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,888
<i>That those who falter
and those who fall</i>

834
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:56,965
<i>Must pay the price</i>

835
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:05,963
<i>Lord, let me find him</i>

836
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:09,203
<i>That I may see him</i>

837
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:13,041
<i>Safe behind bars!</i>

838
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:19,651
<i>I will never rest till then!</i>

839
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,326
<i>This I swear</i>

840
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:28,487
<i>This I swear by the stars!</i>

841
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,524
Come on, boys!

842
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:08,166
Come on.

843
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:17,968
<i>Look down
and see the beggars at your feet!</i>

844
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:24,048
<i>Look down and show
some mercy if you can</i>

845
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:30,128
<i>Look down and see
the sweepings of the street!</i>

846
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:36,287
<i>Look down, look down
upon your fellow man!</i>

847
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:38,807
<i>How do you do?
My name's Gavroche</i>

848
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,931
<i>These are my people,
here's my patch</i>

849
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,691
<i>Not much to look at,
nothing posh</i>

850
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:47,571
<i>Nothing that
you'd call up to scratch</i>

851
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:50,326
<i>This is my school,
my high society</i>

852
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:53,211
<i>Here in
the slums of Saint Michel</i>

853
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,727
<i>We live on
crumbs of humble piety</i>

854
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:58,605
<i>Tough on the teeth,
but what the hell</i>

855
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:01,525
<i>Think you're poor?
Think you're free?</i>

856
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:04,326
<i>Follow me! Follow me!</i>

857
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:09,771
<i>Look down and show
some mercy if you can!</i>

01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:14,289
<i>Look down, look down
upon your fellow man</i>

859
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,686
<i>Wait, Gavroche!</i>

860
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:18,525
<i>There was a time
we killed the king</i>

861
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:21,604
<i>We tried to change
the world too fast</i>

862
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:24,240
<i>Now we have got another king</i>

863
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:27,085
<i>He is no better than the last</i>

864
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:29,846
<i>This is the land
that fought for liberty</i>

865
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:32,611
<i>Now when we fight,
we fight for bread!</i>

866
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:35,491
<i>Here is
the thing about equality</i>

867
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:38,371
<i>Everyone's equal
when they're dead</i>

868
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:41,126
<i>Take your place!
Take your chance!</i>

869
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:43,965
<i>Vive la France!
Vive la France!</i>

870
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:49,411
<i>Look down and show
some mercy if you can!</i>

871
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:55,448
<i>Look down, look down
upon your fellow man</i>

872
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:56,561
<i>When's this gonna end?</i>

873
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:57,886
<i>When we gonna live?</i>

874
01:08:58,040 --> 01:08:59,201
<i>Something's gotta happen now</i>

875
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,481
<i>Something's gotta give</i>

876
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:03,291
<i>it'll come, it'll come, it'll
come it'll come, it'll come</i>

877
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,920
<i>Where are
the leaders of the land?</i>

878
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:08,691
<i>Where is the king
who runs this show?</i>

879
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:11,366
<i>Only one man, General Lamarque</i>

880
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,410
<i>Speaks for
the people here below!</i>

881
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,722
<i>Lamarque is ill and fading fast</i>

882
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,651
<i>Won't last a week out,
so they say</i>

883
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:22,525
<i>With all the anger in the land</i>

884
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:25,041
<i>How long before
the Judgment Day?</i>

885
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:28,568
<i>Before we cut
the fat ones down to size?</i>

886
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:29,721
Death to the king!

887
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:30,881
Liberty for France!

888
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:35,921
<i>Before the barricades arise?</i>

889
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,161
Death to the king!

890
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:41,206
Tell your friends.
We come tomorrow.

<i>And you'd better dig deep</i>

931
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,724
<i>'Cause she doesn't come cheap</i>

932
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,286
Brujon.

933
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:30,601
<i>It's the police! Disappear!</i>

934
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:32,603
<i>Run for it! It's Javert!</i>

935
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:34,444
- Cosette!
- Papa.

936
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,765
<i>Another brawl in the square
Another stink in the air</i>

937
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:41,605
<i>Was there a witness to this?
Well, let him speak to Javert!</i>

938
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:45,128
<i>Monsieur, these streets are not
safe But let these vermin beware</i>

939
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,124
<i>We'll see that justice is done</i>

940
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:51,126
<i>Look upon this fine collection</i>

941
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:53,931
<i>Crawled from underneath a stone</i>

942
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,287
<i>This swarm of worms and maggots</i>

943
01:12:56,680 --> 01:13:00,480
<i>Could have picked you
to the bone</i>

944
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:03,120
<i>I know this man over here
I know his name and his trade</i>

945
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:07,001
<i>And on your witness, monsieur,
I'll see him suitably paid</i>

946
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,806
<i>But where's the gentleman gone?</i>

947
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:13,042
<i>And why on Earth would he run?</i>

948
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:16,363
<i>You will have a job to find him</i>

949
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:19,649
<i>He's not all he seems to be</i>

950
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:23,287
<i>And that girl
he trails behind him</i>

951
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:27,122
<i>Is the child he stole from me</i>

952
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:28,645
Yeah, and me.

953
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,001
Yeah, both of us.

954
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:35,166
<i>Could it be he's that old
jailbird That the tide now washes in?</i>

955
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:40,008
<i>Heard my name and started running
All the omens point to him</i>

956
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:45,686
<i>In the absence of a victim</i>

957
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:51,369
<i>Dear Inspector, may I go?</i>

958
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:56,409
<i>And remember</i>

959
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:00,003
<i>When you've nicked him</i>

960
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:07,200
<i>It was me what told you so</i>

961
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,930
<i>Let the old man keep on running</i>

962
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:15,369
<i>I will run him off his feet!</i>

963
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:21,921
<i>Everyone, about your business
Clear this garbage off the street</i>

964
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:29,043
<i>Cosette! Now I remember</i>

965
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:34,244
<i>Cosette! How can it be?</i>

966
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:39,445
<i>We were children together</i>

967
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:45,402
<i>Look what's become of me</i>

968
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,321
<i>Eponine! Who was that girl?</i>

969
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:53,404
<i>That bourgeois
two-a-penny thing</i>

970
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:55,483
<i>Eponine, find her for me!</i>

971
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,251
<i>What will you give me?</i>

972
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:58,925
<i>Anything!</i>

973
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:03,881
<i>Got you all excited now But
God knows what you see in her</i>

974
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:06,042
<i>Aren't you all delighted now?</i>

975
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:11,001
<i>No,
I don't want your money, sir</i>

976
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:17,571
<i>Eponine, do this for me</i>

977
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:20,087
<i>Discover where she lives</i>

978
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:25,925
<i>But careful how you go
Don't let your father know</i>

979
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:31,685
<i>Eponine! I'm lost
until she's found</i>

980
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:35,530
<i>You see? I told you so</i>

981
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,246
<i>There's lots of things I know</i>

982
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:43,444
<i>'Ponine</i>

983
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:50,563
<i>She knows her way around</i>

984
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:57,641
<i>The time is near</i>

985
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:02,651
<i>So near it's stirring
the blood in their veins</i>

986
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,724
<i>And yet beware!</i>

987
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:11,168
<i>Don't let the wine
go to your brains</i>

988
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:15,166
<i>We need a sign to
rally the people</i>

989
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:16,845
<i>To call them to arms</i>

990
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,083
<i>And to bring them in line!</i>

991
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:23,926
<i>Marius, wake up!
What's wrong today?</i>

992
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,491
<i>You look as if
you've seen a ghost</i>

993
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:28,850
<i>Some wine, and
say what's going on</i>

994
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:32,289
<i>A ghost, you say?
A ghost maybe</i>

995
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:35,370
<i>She was just like a ghost to me</i>

996
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:38,171
<i>One minute there,
then she was gone</i>

997
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:43,004
<i>I am agog!
I am aghast!</i>

998
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:45,771
<i>Is Marius in love at last?</i>

999
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:50,608
<i>I've never heard
him "Ooh" and "Aah"</i>

1000
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,851
<i>You talk of battles to be won</i>

1001
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:56,486
<i>And here he comes like Don Juan</i>

1002
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:02,204
<i>It is better than an opera!</i>

1003
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:10,649
<i>It is time for us all
to decide who we are</i>

1004
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:16,568
<i>Do we fight for the right
to a night at the opera now?</i>

1005
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:22,402
<i>Have you asked of yourself
What's the price you might pay?</i>

1006
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:27,246
<i>Is this simply a game
for a rich young boy to play?</i>

1007
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:33,726
<i>The colors of the world
are changing day by day</i>

1008
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:38,566
<i>Red, the blood of angry men!</i>

1009
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:42,850
<i>Black, the dark of ages past!</i>

1010
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,891
<i>Red, a world about to dawn!</i>

1011
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:53,247
<i>Black,
the night that ends at last!</i>

1012
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:58,686
<i>Had you seen her today
you might know how it feels</i>

1013
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:04,085
<i>To be struck to the bone in a
moment of breathless delight!</i>

1014
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:08,365
<i>Had you been there today
you might also have known</i>

1015
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:13,446
<i>How your world may be changed
in just one burst of light</i>

1016
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,331
<i>And what was right seems wrong</i>

1017
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:20,565
<i>And what was wrong seems right</i>

1018
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:21,687
<i>Red!</i>

1019
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,411
<i>I feel my soul on fire!</i>

1020
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:25,767
<i>Black!</i>

1021
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:28,446
<i>My world if she's not there!</i>

1022
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:29,806
<i>Red!</i>

1023
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:32,611
<i>The color of desire!</i>

1024
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:33,761
<i>Black!</i>

1025
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:37,327
<i>The color of despair!</i>

1026
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,769
<i>Marius,
you're no longer a child</i>

1027
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,763
<i>I do not doubt you mean it well</i>

1028
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:44,321
<i>But now there is a higher call</i>

1029
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:45,720
<i>I know.</i>

1030
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:48,201
<i>Who cares about
your lonely soul?</i>

1031
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:50,806
<i>We strive towards a larger goal</i>

1032
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:55,204
<i>Our little lives
don't count at all!</i>

1033
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,691
<i>Red!</i>

1034
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:59,605
<i>The blood of angry men!</i>

1035
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:00,721
<i>Black!</i>

1036
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:03,411
<i>The dark of ages past!</i>

1037
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:04,961
<i>Red!</i>

1038
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:07,726
<i>A world about to dawn!</i>

1039
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:09,241
<i>Black!</i>

1040
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:16,124
<i>The night that ends at last!</i>

1041
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:17,327
<i>Listen, everybody!</i>

1042
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,568
General Lamarque is dead.

1043
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:28,122
<i>Lamarque, his
death is the hour of fate</i>

1044
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:29,810
<i>The people's man</i>

1045
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:37,688
<i>His death is the sign we await!</i>

1046
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:40,491
<i>On his funeral day
they will honor his name</i>

1047
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,291
<i>With the light of
rebellion ablaze in their eyes</i>

1048
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:46,644
<i>From their candles of grief
we will kindle our flame</i>

1049
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:49,969
<i>On the tomb of Lamarque
shall our barricade rise!</i>

1050
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:52,009
<i>The time is here!</i>

1051
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:55,004
<i>Let us welcome it gladly
with courage and cheer!</i>

1052
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:57,845
<i>Let us take to the streets
with no doubt in our hearts</i>

1053
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,486
<i>But a jubilant shout!</i>

1054
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:02,644
<i>They will come one and all!</i>

1055
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:09,331
<i>They will come when we call!</i>

1056
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:15,284
Did you find her?

1057
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:24,889
<i>How strange</i>

1058
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:28,931
<i>This feeling that
my life's begun at last</i>

1059
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:31,367
<i>This change</i>

1060
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:34,967
<i>Can people really
fall in love so fast?</i>

1061
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:38,969
<i>What's the matter
with you, Cosette?</i>

1062
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:42,567
<i>Have you been
too much on your own?</i>

1063
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:45,246
<i>So many things unclear</i>

1064
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:49,764
<i>So many things unknown</i>

1065
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,926
<i>In my life</i>

1066
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,521
<i>There are so many
questions and answers</i>

1067
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,285
<i>That somehow seem wrong</i>

1068
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:02,610
<i>In my life</i>

1069
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:05,161
<i>There are times when
I catch in the silence</i>

1070
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:08,449
<i>The sigh of a faraway song</i>

1071
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:10,841
<i>And it sings</i>

1072
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:15,244
<i>Of a world that I long to see
Out of reach</i>

1073
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:19,644
<i>Just a whisper away
Waiting for me</i>

1074
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:24,488
<i>Does he know I'm alive?
Do I know if he's real?</i>

1075
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:28,964
<i>Does he see what I see?
Does he feel what I feel?</i>

1076
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,688
<i>In my life</i>

1077
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:34,010
<i>I'm no longer alone</i>

1078
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:37,482
<i>Now the love in
my life is so near</i>

1079
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:41,646
<i>Find me now</i>

1080
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:45,043
<i>Find me here</i>

1081
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:51,322
<i>Dear Cosette</i>

1082
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:54,051
<i>You're such a lonely child</i>

1083
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:58,728
<i>How pensive,
how sad you seem to me</i>

1084
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:03,523
<i>Believe me,
were it within my power</i>

1085
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:06,884
<i>I'd fill each passing hour</i>

1086
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:11,842
<i>How quiet it must be, I can see</i>

1087
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,050
<i>With only me for company</i>

1088
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,680
<i>There's so little I know
that I'm longing to know</i>

1089
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:22,684
<i>Of the man that you were
in a time long ago</i>

1090
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:23,801
Please, Cosette.

1091
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:26,646
<i>There's so little you say
of the life you have known</i>

1092
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:30,361
<i>Why you keep to yourself
Why you're always alone</i>

1093
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:33,569
<i>So dark So dark and deep</i>

1094
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:37,363
<i>The secrets that you keep</i>

1095
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,883
<i>In my life</i>

1096
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:46,727
<i>Please forgive what I say You
are loving and gentle and good</i>

1097
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:51,568
<i>But Papa, dear Papa</i>

1098
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:55,486
<i>In your eyes I am still like that
child who was lost in a wood</i>

1099
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:57,890
<i>No more words</i>

1100
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:00,808
<i>No more words
It's a time that is dead</i>

1101
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,448
<i>There are words</i>

1102
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:08,082
<i>That are better unheard
Better unsaid</i>

1103
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,562
<i>In my life</i>

1104
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:15,408
<i>I'm no longer a child and I yearn
for the truth that you know</i>

1105
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:21,086
<i>Of the years, years ago</i>

1106
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,242
<i>You will learn</i>

1107
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:28,246
<i>Truth is given by God
to us all in our time</i>

1108
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:29,805
<i>In our turn</i>

1109
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:41,604
<i>In my life</i>

1110
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:46,482
<i>She has burst like the music
of angels The light of the sun</i>

1111
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:51,127
<i>And my life seems to stop
as if something is over</i>

1112
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:53,681
<i>And something
has scarcely begun!</i>

1113
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:57,487
<i>Eponine, you're the friend
who has brought me here</i>

1114
01:23:57,640 --> 01:24:00,803
<i>Thanks to you
I'm at one with the gods</i>

1115
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:03,281
<i>And heaven is near!</i>

1116
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:07,286
<i>And I soar through a world
that is new That is free</i>

1117
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:11,481
<i>Every word that he says
is a dagger in me</i>

1118
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:15,161
<i>In my life</i>

1119
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:18,967
<i>There's been no one
like him anywhere</i>

1120
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:22,567
<i>Anywhere, where he is</i>

1121
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:28,846
<i>If he asked, I'd be his</i>

1122
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:32,808
<i>In my life</i>

1123
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:36,846
<i>There is someone
who touches my life</i>

1124
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:39,323
<i>Waiting near</i>

1125
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:43,085
<i>Waiting here</i>

1126
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:55,522
<i>A heart full of love</i>

1127
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:02,683
<i>A heart full of song</i>

1128
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:05,047
<i>I'm doing everything all wrong</i>

1129
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:10,603
<i>Oh God, for shame
I do not even know your name</i>

1130
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:14,042
<i>Dear mademoiselle</i>

1131
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:17,801
<i>Won't you Say?</i>

1132
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:20,281
<i>Will you tell?</i>

1133
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:25,082
<i>A heart full of love</i>

1134
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:30,809
<i>No fear, no regret</i>

1135
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:33,645
<i>My name is Marius Pontmercy</i>

1136
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:36,247
<i>And mine's Cosette</i>

1137
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:39,849
<i>Cosette,
I don't know what to say</i>

1138
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:43,206
<i>Then make no sound</i>

1139
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:46,328
<i>I am lost</i>

1140
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:48,610
<i>I am found</i>

1141
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:52,162
<i>A heart full of love</i>

1142
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,527
<i>He was never mine to lose</i>

1143
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:57,763
<i>A heart full of you</i>

1144
01:25:57,960 --> 01:25:59,644
<i>A single look and then I knew</i>

1145
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:01,529
<i>Why regret what could not be?</i>

1146
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:04,001
<i>I knew it, too</i>

1147
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:07,960
<i>These are words he'll never say</i>

1148
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:10,681
<i>Not to me</i>

1149
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:12,808
<i>From today</i>

1150
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:16,407
<i>Not to me Not for me</i>

1151
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:17,527
<i>Every day</i>

1152
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:21,602
<i>His heart full of love</i>

1153
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:25,088
<i>For it isn't a dream</i>

1154
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:29,608
<i>He will never feel this way</i>

1155
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:33,082
<i>Not a dream after all</i>

1156
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:39,291
<i>Cosette?</i>

1157
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:43,961
Cosette, what are you doing?

1158
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:46,887
I told you to stay inside.

1159
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:09,882
<i>Who is this hussy?</i>

1160
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:12,725
<i>It's your brat Eponine!
Don't you know your own kid?</i>

1161
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:15,645
<i>Why's she hanging about here?</i>

1162
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:18,531
<i>Eponine, get on home
You're not needed in this</i>

1163
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:22,002
<i>We're enough here without you</i>

1164
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:24,681
<i>I know this house, I tell you</i>

1165
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:28,050
<i>There's nothing here for you</i>

1166
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:31,761
<i>Just the old man and the girl</i>

1167
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:35,208
<i>They live ordinary lives</i>

1168
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:37,522
<i>Don't interfere
You've got some gall</i>

1169
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:39,808
<i>Take care, young miss
You've got a lot to say</i>

1170
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:42,201
<i>I'm gonna scream!
I'm gonna warn them here!</i>

1171
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:45,449
<i>One little scream and you'll
regret it for a year!</i>

1172
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:48,560
My God, Cosette!

1173
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:52,245
<i>You wait, my girl!
You'll rue this night!</i>

1174
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:54,209
<i>I'll make you scream!</i>

1175
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:55,691
<i>You'll scream all right!</i>

1176
01:27:57,760 --> 01:27:59,205
Police!

1177
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:02,683
<i>Must be Javert</i>

1178
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:05,247
<i>He's found my cover at last</i>

1179
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:06,765
<i>I've got to get Cosette away</i>

1180
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:09,127
We'll go to our apartment at Rue
de I'Homme Armé, it's safer there.

1181
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:11,203
Then I'll arrange our
passage to England. No.

1182
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:13,124
<i>Hurry, Cosette!
Prepare to leave Say no more</i>

1183
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:14,770
<i>Tonight we'll away</i>

1184
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:16,763
<i>Please, Papa, we can't!
Hurry, Cosette!</i>

1185
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:19,287
<i>It's time to close another
door and live another day!</i>

1186
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:20,720
Get dressed,
we're leaving. Now!

1187
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,166
Please, no!

1188
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:58,044
<i>On my own</i>

1189
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:02,649
<i>Pretending he's beside me</i>

1190
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:06,964
<i>All alone</i>

1191
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:11,284
<i>I walk with him till morning</i>

1192
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:15,561
<i>Without him</i>

1193
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:19,520
<i>I feel his arms around me</i>

1194
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:24,288
<i>And when I lose my way
I close my eyes</i>

1195
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:28,291
<i>And he has found me</i>

1196
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:33,442
<i>In the rain</i>

1197
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:38,481
<i>The pavement shines like silver</i>

1198
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:41,641
<i>All the lights</i>

1199
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:45,486
<i>Are misty in the river</i>

1200
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:53,686
<i>In the darkness the trees
are full of starlight</i>

1201
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:59,324
<i>And all I see is him and me
forever and forever</i>

1202
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:06,402
<i>And I know</i>

1203
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:11,202
<i>It's only in my mind</i>

1204
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:15,285
<i>That I'm talking to myself</i>

1205
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:18,241
<i>And not to him</i>

1206
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:25,329
<i>And although
I know that he is blind</i>

1207
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:27,927
<i>Still I say</i>

1208
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:32,125
<i>There's a way for us</i>

1209
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:35,243
<i>I love him</i>

1210
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:39,200
<i>But when the night is over</i>

1211
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:45,361
<i>He is gone,
the river's just a river</i>

1212
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:52,287
<i>Without him
the world around me changes</i>

1213
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:55,205
<i>The trees are bare
and everywhere</i>

1214
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:58,170
<i>the streets are
full of strangers</i>

1215
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:00,687
<i>I love him</i>

1216
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:05,368
<i>But every day I'm learning</i>

1217
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:12,483
<i>All my life
I've only been pretending</i>

1218
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:18,291
<i>Without me,
his world will go on turning</i>

1219
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:21,205
<i>A world that's
full of happiness</i>

1220
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:27,845
<i>That I have never known</i>

1221
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:34,408
<i>I love him</i>

1222
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:40,964
<i>I love him</i>

1223
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,769
<i>I love him</i>

1224
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:58,083
<i>But only on my own</i>

1225
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:14,604
<i>One day more</i>

1226
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:18,128
<i>Another day, another destiny</i>

1227
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:21,648
<i>This never-ending
road to Calvary</i>

1228
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:26,681
<i>These men who seem to know my crime
will surely come a second time</i>

1229
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:27,841
<i>One day more</i>

1230
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:31,481
<i>I did not live until today</i>

1231
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:38,489
<i>How can I live
when we are parted?</i>

1232
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:40,646
<i>One day more</i>

1233
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:45,488
<i>Tomorrow you'll be worlds away</i>

1234
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:52,122
<i>And yet with you
my world has started</i>

1235
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:57,609
<i>One more day all on my own</i>

1236
01:32:57,800 --> 01:33:00,644
<i>Will we ever meet again?</i>

1237
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:03,969
<i>One more day
with him not caring</i>

1238
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:07,203
<i>I was born to be with you</i>

1239
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:10,170
<i>What a life I might have known</i>

1240
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:13,688
<i>And I swear I will be true</i>

1241
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:21,129
<i>But he never saw me there</i>

1242
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:25,251
<i>One more day before the storm</i>

1243
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:28,244
<i>Do I follow where she goes?</i>

1244
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:31,006
<i>At the barricades of freedom!</i>

1245
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:33,845
<i>Shall I join my brothers there?</i>

1246
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:36,691
<i>When our ranks begin to form</i>

1247
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:39,201
<i>Do I stay and do I dare?</i>

1248
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:42,928
<i>Will you take
your place with me?</i>

1249
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:45,481
<i>The time is now!</i>

1250
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:49,685
<i>The day is here!</i>

1251
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:51,046
<i>One day more!</i>

1252
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:56,604
<i>One day more to revolution
We will nip it in the bud</i>

1253
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:58,967
<i>We'll be ready
for these schoolboys</i>

1254
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:01,008
<i>They will wet themselves
with blood!</i>

1255
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:02,241
<i>One day more!</i>

1256
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:03,561
<i>Watch 'em run amuck</i>

1257
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:04,881
<i>Catch 'em as they fall</i>

1258
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:07,771
<i>Never know your luck
when there's a free-for-all</i>

1259
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:09,206
<i>Here's a little dip</i>

1260
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:10,560
<i>There a little touch</i>

1261
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:13,326
<i>Most of them are goners
So they won't miss much!</i>

1262
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:16,165
<i>One day to a new beginning</i>

1263
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:19,164
<i>Raise the flag of freedom high!</i>

1264
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:24,611
<i>Every man will be a king!</i>

1265
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:27,571
<i>There's a new world
for the winning!</i>

1266
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:30,161
<i>There's a new world to be won</i>

1267
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:33,483
<i>Do you hear the people sing?</i>

1268
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:35,927
<i>My place is here!</i>

1269
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:39,607
<i>I fight with you!</i>

1270
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:42,370
<i>One day more!</i>

1271
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:44,926
<i>We will join
these people's heroes</i>

1272
01:34:45,120 --> 01:34:46,451
<i>We will follow where they go</i>

1273
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:47,800
<i>One more day all on my own</i>

1274
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:50,850
<i>We will learn
their little secrets</i>

1275
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,280
<i>We will know
the things they know</i>

1276
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:53,481
<i>One day more!</i>

1277
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:55,040
<i>Tomorrow you'll be worlds away</i>

1278
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:56,485
<i>One more day to revolution</i>

1279
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:57,846
<i>What a life I might have known</i>

1280
01:34:57,960 --> 01:34:59,007
<i>We will nip it in the bud</i>

1281
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:00,320
<i>And yet with you
my world has started</i>

1282
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:01,801
<i>We'll be ready
for these schoolboys</i>

1283
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:03,330
<i>Tomorrow will be far away</i>

1284
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:05,010
<i>Tomorrow is the judgment day</i>

1285
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:06,889
<i>Tomorrow we'll discover</i>

1286
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:11,682
<i>What our God in heaven
has in store</i>

1287
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:14,320
<i>One more dawn!</i>

1288
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:18,084
<i>One more day!</i>

1289
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:25,169
<i>One day more!</i>

1290
01:35:50,680 --> 01:35:53,490
<i>Do you hear the people sing</i>

1291
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:56,804
<i>Singing the song of angry men?</i>

1292
01:35:57,320 --> 01:36:03,487
<i>It is the music of a people
who will not be slaves again</i>

1293
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:06,769
<i>When the beating of your heart</i>

1294
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:10,049
<i>Echoes the beating of the drums</i>

1295
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:15,610
<i>There is a life about to start
when tomorrow comes!</i>

1296
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:19,530
<i>Will you join in our crusade?</i>

1297
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:23,366
<i>Who will be strong
and stand with me?</i>

1298
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:29,527
<i>Beyond the barricade is there
a world you long to see?</i>

1299
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:31,210
<i>Then join in the fight</i>

1300
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:35,081
<i>That will give you
the right to be free!</i>

1301
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:38,689
<i>Do you hear the people sing</i>

1302
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:41,491
<i>Singing the song of angry men?</i>

1303
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:47,488
<i>It is the music of a people
who will not be slaves again!</i>

1304
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:53,084
<i>When the beating of your heart
echoes the beating of the drums</i>

1305
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:59,762
<i>There is a life about to start
when tomorrow comes!</i>

1306
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:03,131
<i>Will you give all you can give</i>

1307
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:06,130
<i>So that our banner may advance?</i>

1308
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:09,046
<i>Some will fall
and some will live</i>

1309
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:12,921
<i>Will you stand up
and take your chance?</i>

1310
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:18,251
<i>The blood of the martyrs will
water the meadows of France!</i>

1311
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:21,251
<i>Do you hear the people sing</i>

1312
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:24,245
<i>Singing the song of angry men?</i>

1313
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:30,083
<i>It is the music of a people
who will not be slaves again!</i>

1314
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:36,128
<i>When the beating of your heart
echoes the beating of the drums</i>

1315
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:42,731
<i>There is a life about to start
when tomorrow comes!</i>

1316
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:48,923
Halt!

1317
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:52,125
Draw!

1318
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:00,931
She's an innocent woman!

1319
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:02,320
Murderer!

1320
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,001
Come here, you!

1321
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,445
Charge!

1322
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:09,961
Push them to the right.

1323
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:18,484
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, monsieur.

1324
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:20,001
To the barricades!

1325
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:22,290
<i>Vive la France!</i>

1326
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:27,531
Get to the barricade!

1327
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:28,926
Come on!

1328
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,011
Get down! Get down!

1329
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:41,090
Go, go, go!

1330
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:46,285
Get off your arse!
It's begun!

1331
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:48,130
The barricade!

1332
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:50,009
Sorry, madame. Thank you.
What are you doing?

1333
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:57,610
We need as much furniture
as you can throw down!

1334
01:38:57,760 --> 01:38:59,683
Throw everything you have!

1335
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:08,486
Below!

1336
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:11,360
Watch yourself, watch yourself.

1337
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:18,326
Go on, boys!

1338
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:20,967
No!

1339
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:24,806
Thank you, madame.

1340
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:25,881
I need a volunteer!

1341
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:29,011
Someone who can find out their
plan and when they will attack.

1342
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:30,650
<i>I can find out the truth</i>

1343
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:33,481
<i>I know their ways</i>

1344
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:37,486
<i>Fought their wars
Served my time</i>

1345
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:41,801
<i>In the days Of my youth</i>

1346
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:44,402
<i>See? The people unite!</i>

1347
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:46,289
<i>I pray you're right</i>

1348
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:48,643
<i>Dogs will bark</i>

1349
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:50,404
<i>Fleas will bite!</i>

1350
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:52,683
<i>They will do what is right</i>

1351
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:06,080
<i>Red, the blood of angry men!</i>

1352
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:10,086
<i>Black, the dark of ages past!</i>

1353
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:14,086
<i>Red, a world about to dawn!</i>

1354
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:21,010
<i>Black,
the night that ends at last!</i>

1355
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:25,765
He's back!

1356
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:29,607
<i>Listen, my friends
I have done as I said</i>

1357
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:32,445
<i>I have been to their lines
I have counted each man</i>

1358
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:35,444
<i>I will tell what I can</i>

1359
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:38,281
<i>Better beware
They have armies to spare</i>

1360
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:39,726
<i>And our danger is real</i>

1361
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:43,089
<i>We will need all our cunning
to bring them to heel</i>

1362
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:44,651
<i>Have faith!</i>

1363
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:48,647
<i>If you know what their movements
are we'll spoil their game</i>

1364
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:51,280
<i>There are ways that
a people can fight</i>

1365
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:55,644
<i>We shall overcome their power!</i>

1366
01:40:56,680 --> 01:40:59,490
<i>I have overheard their plans</i>

1367
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:01,961
<i>There will be no attack tonight</i>

1368
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:04,128
<i>They intend to starve you out</i>

1369
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:06,760
<i>Before they
start a proper fight</i>

1370
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:09,042
<i>Concentrate their force</i>

1371
01:41:09,200 --> 01:41:11,328
<i>Hit us when it's light</i>

1372
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:12,720
Liar!

1373
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:17,685
<i>Good evening, dear Inspector
Lovely evening, my dear!</i>

1374
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:21,407
<i>I know this man, my friends
His name's Inspector Javert!</i>

1375
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:25,485
<i>So don't believe a word he
says because none of it's true</i>

1376
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:29,162
<i>This only goes to show
what little people can do</i>

1377
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:32,251
<i>Bravo, little Gavroche
You're the top of the class</i>

1378
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:35,204
<i>So what are we going to do
with this snake in the grass?</i>

1379
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:38,091
<i>Take this man and throw him
in the tavern in there</i>

1380
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:41,164
<i>The people will decide your
fate, Inspector Javert</i>

1381
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:44,443
<i>Shoot me now or shoot me later</i>

1382
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:46,807
<i>Every schoolboy to his sport!</i>

1383
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:49,281
<i>Death to each
and every traitor!</i>

1384
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:51,721
<i>I renounce your people's court!</i>

1385
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:53,401
We keep looking forward!

1386
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:22,086
To your positions.

1387
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:23,287
Move!

1388
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:35,562
Now, hold your fire.
Hold your fire.

1389
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:37,051
Front rank, kneel!

1390
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:38,281
Save your gunpowder.

1391
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:39,646
Take aim!

1392
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:41,366
Get down.

1393
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:42,686
Who's there?

1394
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:47,970
French Revolution!

1395
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:49,681
Fire!

1396
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:55,126
They're coming!

1397
01:42:58,120 --> 01:42:59,610
They're coming
over the barricades!

1398
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:01,125
Get back!

1399
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:16,766
Marius! No!

1400
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:20,364
Marius!
What are you doing?

1401
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:21,441
Get down!

1402
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:22,931
Marius, watch out!

1403
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,126
Get down!

1404
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:25,806
No!

1405
01:43:29,080 --> 01:43:30,491
Fall back!

1406
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:32,802
Fall back,
or I blow the barricade!

1407
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:34,400
Blow it up and
take yourself with it!

1408
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:37,326
Christ!

1409
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:42,123
And myself with it.

1410
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:46,323
Back! Back!

1411
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:54,406
Man the barricade!

1412
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:55,561
What were you thinking, Marius?

1413
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:56,641
You could have
gotten us all killed!

1414
01:43:56,720 --> 01:43:58,051
Marius, you saved us all.

1415
01:43:58,160 --> 01:43:59,491
My life is not yours to risk!

1416
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:01,244
Eponine.
What are you doing?

1417
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:02,845
I kept it from you.

1418
01:44:03,240 --> 01:44:05,004
It's from Cosette.

1419
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:07,048
The rain's
going to ruin the powder.

1420
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:08,447
I'm sorry.

1421
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:12,964
What have you done?

1422
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:19,726
'Ponine.

1423
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:27,843
<i>Don't you fret, Monsieur Marius</i>

1424
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:34,242
<i>I don't feel any pain</i>

1425
01:44:35,120 --> 01:44:39,682
<i>A little fall of rain</i>

1426
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:44,366
<i>Can hardly hurt me now</i>

1427
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:49,725
<i>You're here</i>

1428
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:54,727
<i>That's all I need to know</i>

1429
01:44:55,880 --> 01:45:00,204
<i>And you will keep me safe</i>

1430
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:04,206
<i>And you will keep me close</i>

1431
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:11,651
<i>And rain will
make the flowers grow</i>

1432
01:45:12,480 --> 01:45:17,725
<i>But you will live, 'Ponine
Dear God above!</i>

1433
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:22,609
<i>If I could close your wounds
with words of love</i>

1434
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:28,324
<i>Just hold me now, and let it be</i>

1435
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:33,122
<i>Shelter me, comfort me</i>

1436
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:35,851
<i>Hush-a-bye, dear Eponine</i>

1437
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:38,566
<i>So don't you fret,
Monsieur Marius</i>

1438
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:42,481
<i>You won't feel any pain
I don't feel any pain</i>

1439
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:47,605
<i>A little fall of rain
A little fall of rain</i>

1440
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:51,606
<i>Can hardly hurt you now
Can hardly hurt me now</i>

1441
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:54,443
<i>I'm here</i>

1442
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:59,401
<i>That's all I need to know</i>

1443
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:04,731
<i>And I will stay with you
And you will keep me safe</i>

1444
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:09,687
<i>Till you are sleeping
And you will keep me close</i>

1445
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:15,441
<i>And rain</i>

1446
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:21,084
<i>Will make the flowers</i>

1447
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:25,851
<i>Grow</i>

1448
01:46:56,480 --> 01:46:58,847
Gavroche, will you
do something for me?

1449
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:02,685
Anything. Without you,
I'd have bitten the dust.

1450
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:08,691
Letter from the barricade.

1451
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:10,126
From the barricade?

1452
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:11,726
I'll take it.

1453
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:17,209
Something for me, something for you.
Who needs charity?

1454
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,047
Boy.

1455
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:22,410
You stay away from there,
you understand?

1456
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:31,684
<i>"Dearest Cosette,
you have entered my soul"</i>

1457
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:33,564
<i>"And soon you will be gone"</i>

1458
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:39,284
<i>"Can it be only a day since we
met and the world was reborn?"</i>

1459
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:44,725
<i>"If I should fall in the battle
to come let this be my goodbye"</i>

1460
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,962
<i>"Now that I know
that you love..."</i>

1461
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:54,971
<i>"You love me as well
It is harder to die"</i>

1462
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:59,045
<i>"I pray that God will bring
me home to be with you"</i>

1463
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:02,050
<i>"Pray for your Marius"</i>

1464
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:05,528
<i>"He prays for you"</i>

1465
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:09,446
Oh, God.

1466
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:12,089
<i>This is the day
that most I feared</i>

1467
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:16,165
<i>Now a young man has appeared
to change my life</i>

1468
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:21,167
<i>This Marius will take away the treasure
of my autumn days to be his wife</i>

1469
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:25,570
<i>But he could die tonight</i>

1470
01:48:30,040 --> 01:48:32,771
<i>I must find this boy</i>

1471
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:50,482
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

1472
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:52,530
I come here as a volunteer.

1473
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,650
You see...

1474
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:01,442
<i>You see that
prisoner over there?</i>

1475
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:03,050
<i>A volunteer like you!</i>

1476
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:04,804
<i>A spy who calls himself Javert!</i>

1477
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:06,769
<i>He's going to get it, too!</i>

1478
01:49:07,080 --> 01:49:08,366
Get in there.
Get inside.

1479
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:10,329
Don't kill him.
I know him.

1480
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,047
Enemy marksman!

1481
01:49:12,120 --> 01:49:13,645
On the roof!
On the roof!

1482
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:17,121
On the roof!

1483
01:49:18,280 --> 01:49:20,089
Where are they?
Where are they?

1484
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:21,361
We'll take the left.

1485
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:22,601
We'll take the right.

1486
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:23,926
Eyes forward!

1487
01:49:24,280 --> 01:49:26,487
Eyes to the roofs,
eyes to the roofs.

1488
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:27,801
<i>Thank you, monsieur.</i>

1489
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:31,802
<i>Give me no thanks, monsieur
There's something you can do</i>

1490
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,843
<i>If it is in my power</i>

1491
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:38,491
<i>Give me the spy Javert!
Let me take care of him</i>

1492
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:45,965
<i>Do what you have to do
The man belongs to you</i>

1493
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:49,242
No. Enjolras.

1494
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:18,166
<i>We meet again</i>

1495
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:21,927
<i>You've hungered for
this all your life</i>

1496
01:50:22,520 --> 01:50:24,522
<i>Take your revenge</i>

1497
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:29,324
<i>How right you
should kill with a knife</i>

1498
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:33,324
<i>Get out of here</i>

1499
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:34,721
<i>Don't understand</i>

1500
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:37,406
<i>Clear out of here</i>

1501
01:50:42,360 --> 01:50:46,331
<i>Once a thief, forever a thief</i>

1502
01:50:46,720 --> 01:50:50,247
<i>What you want, you always steal</i>

1503
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:53,131
<i>You would trade
your life for mine</i>

1504
01:50:53,560 --> 01:50:56,564
<i>Yes, Valjean, you want a deal</i>

1505
01:50:56,720 --> 01:50:59,246
<i>Shoot me now for all I care!</i>

1506
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:05,043
<i>If you let me go, beware!
You'll still answer to Javert!</i>

1507
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:12,801
<i>You are wrong and
always have been wrong</i>

1508
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:19,130
<i>I'm a man no worse than any man</i>

1509
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:25,288
<i>And you are free and
there are no conditions</i>

1510
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:28,603
<i>No bargains or petitions</i>

1511
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:32,645
<i>There's nothing
that I blame you for</i>

1512
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:37,526
<i>You've done your duty,
nothing more</i>

1513
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:42,801
If I come out of this alive...

1514
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:46,521
<i>You will find me at
Rue de I'Homme Armé, number 5</i>

1515
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:52,446
No doubt our paths
will cross again.

1516
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:24,564
<i>Courfeyrac, you take the watch</i>

1517
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:27,007
<i>They may attack
before it's light</i>

1518
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:30,161
<i>Everybody, keep the faith</i>

1519
01:52:31,160 --> 01:52:35,768
<i>For certain as our banner
flies We are not alone</i>

1520
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,447
<i>The people too must rise</i>

1521
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:42,726
Marius.

1522
01:52:43,680 --> 01:52:44,761
Rest.

1523
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:52,965
<i>Drink with me</i>

1524
01:52:53,960 --> 01:52:57,646
<i>To days gone by!</i>

1525
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:05,043
<i>To the life that used to be</i>

1526
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:10,281
<i>At the shrine of friendship
never say die</i>

1527
01:53:10,720 --> 01:53:16,011
<i>Let the wine of friendship
never run dry</i>

1528
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:23,123
<i>Here's to you and here's to me!</i>

1529
01:53:25,480 --> 01:53:31,044
<i>Do I care if I should die
now she goes across the sea?</i>

1530
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:36,565
<i>Life without Cosette
means nothing at all</i>

1531
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:41,328
<i>Would you weep, Cosette,
if I were to fall?</i>

1532
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:46,484
<i>Would you weep, Cosette</i>

1533
01:53:48,040 --> 01:53:48,540
<i>For me?</i>

1534
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:06,148
<i>God on high</i>

1535
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:17,606
<i>Hear my prayer</i>

1536
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:21,780
<i>In my need</i>

1537
01:54:24,840 --> 01:54:29,971
<i>You have always been there</i>

1538
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:38,324
<i>He is young</i>

1539
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:44,885
<i>He's afraid</i>

1540
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:50,401
<i>Let him rest</i>

1541
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:55,043
<i>Heaven blessed</i>

1542
01:54:56,480 --> 01:55:01,480
<i>Bring him home</i>

1543
01:55:02,405 --> 01:55:05,205
<i>Bring him home</i>

1544
01:55:09,480 --> 01:55:11,960
<i>Bring him home</i>

1545
01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:18,287
<i>He's like the son
I might have known</i>

1546
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:23,169
<i>If God had granted me a son</i>

1547
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:28,967
<i>The summers die One by one</i>

1548
01:55:29,120 --> 01:55:34,160
<i>How soon they fly On and on</i>

1549
01:55:35,160 --> 01:55:38,767
<i>And I am old</i>

1550
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,686
<i>And will be gone</i>

1551
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:53,283
<i>Bring him peace</i>

1552
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:58,721
<i>Bring him joy</i>

1553
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:04,690
<i>He is young</i>

1554
01:56:05,320 --> 01:56:09,530
<i>He is only a boy</i>

1555
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:18,570
<i>You can take</i>

1556
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:23,567
<i>You can give</i>

1557
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:28,726
<i>Let him be</i>

1558
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:34,046
<i>Let him live</i>

1559
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:34,744
<i>If I die</i>

1560
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:44,406
<i>Let me die</i>

1561
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:51,482
<i>Let him live</i>

1562
01:56:53,160 --> 01:56:58,485
<i>Bring him home</i>

1563
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:04,969
<i>Bring him home</i>

1564
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:12,281
<i>Bring him</i>

1565
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:12,860
<i>Home!</i>

1566
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:35,646
Enjolras, the rain has
damaged the gunpowder.

1567
01:57:35,720 --> 01:57:36,926
We're low on ammunition.

1568
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:38,411
We're the only barricade left.

1569
01:57:39,120 --> 01:57:40,326
What?

1570
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:42,410
We're the only ones left.

1571
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:49,491
<i>The people have not stirred</i>

1572
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:53,606
<i>We are abandoned by those
who still live in fear</i>

1573
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:55,649
<i>Let us not waste lives</i>

1574
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:58,162
<i>Let all who wish to</i>

1575
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,082
<i>Go from here</i>

1576
01:58:08,200 --> 01:58:10,771
<i>Do you hear the people sing</i>

1577
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:13,970
<i>Singing the song of angry men?</i>

1578
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:19,650
<i>It is the music of a people
who will not be slaves again</i>

1579
01:58:20,040 --> 01:58:25,843
<i>When the beating of your heart
echoes the beating of the drums</i>

1580
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:31,211
<i>There is a life about to start
when tomorrow comes!</i>

1581
01:58:33,160 --> 01:58:34,685
Enjolras,
we need more ammunition.

1582
01:58:34,840 --> 01:58:37,366
I'm going into the colonnade. There are
dead bodies there, dry ammunition.

1583
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:38,561
The gunpowder is wet through.

1584
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:40,920
Let's round it up.
Let's get everything out here.

1585
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:45,722
<i>Little people know
when little people fight</i>

1586
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:48,841
<i>We may look easy pickings</i>

1587
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:51,644
Gavroche.

1588
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:53,330
<i>But we've got some bite!</i>

1589
01:58:53,560 --> 01:58:54,891
Come here.

1590
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:59,801
<i>So never kick a dog
because he's just a pup</i>

1591
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:04,647
Gavroche!

1592
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:10,682
<i>We'll fight like 20 armies
and we won't give up</i>

1593
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:13,284
Gavroche! Gavroche,
what are you doing?

1594
01:59:13,440 --> 01:59:15,283
Someone pull him back!

1595
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:16,965
You dirty bastard!

1596
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:22,042
<i>So you'd better run for cover</i>

1597
01:59:23,040 --> 01:59:24,201
<i>When the pup...</i>

1598
01:59:25,240 --> 01:59:26,287
Grows...

1599
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:49,765
<i>You at
the barricades, listen to this!</i>

1600
01:59:51,240 --> 01:59:54,164
<i>The people of Paris
sleep in their beds!</i>

1601
01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:57,005
<i>You have no chance</i>

1602
01:59:57,680 --> 01:59:59,523
<i>No chance at all</i>

1603
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:04,606
<i>Why throw your lives away?</i>

1604
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:13,607
<i>Let us die facing our foes</i>

1605
02:00:14,240 --> 02:00:16,561
<i>Make them bleed while we can</i>

1606
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:18,650
<i>Make them pay through the nose</i>

1607
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:20,484
<i>Make them pay for every man</i>

1608
02:00:20,640 --> 02:00:25,646
<i>Let others rise
to take our place</i>

1609
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:31,921
<i>Until the Earth is free!</i>

1610
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:34,805
Cannons!

1611
02:00:35,960 --> 02:00:37,644
Quick as you can! Come on!

1612
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:39,245
Look lively!

1613
02:00:39,560 --> 02:00:40,721
Far right first.

1614
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:42,046
Wait for it!

1615
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:43,571
Fire!

1616
02:00:46,640 --> 02:00:47,846
Marius.

1617
02:00:48,960 --> 02:00:50,240
They're bringing
in replacements.

1618
02:00:50,280 --> 02:00:51,401
Second cannon!

1619
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:52,760
Fire!

1620
02:00:54,800 --> 02:00:55,926
Fire!

1621
02:00:57,240 --> 02:00:58,321
Take aim!

1622
02:00:58,520 --> 02:00:59,601
Fire!

1623
02:00:59,680 --> 02:01:00,681
Take cover, boy!

1624
02:01:03,120 --> 02:01:06,044
There's more men!
There's more men, Enjolras!

1625
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,286
Cannons ready!

1626
02:01:08,360 --> 02:01:09,441
Fire!

1627
02:01:17,680 --> 02:01:19,125
Cannons ready!

1628
02:01:19,800 --> 02:01:21,962
And fire!

1629
02:01:30,280 --> 02:01:31,805
Advance!

1630
02:01:32,360 --> 02:01:33,771
Watch out!

1631
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:47,921
Please!

1632
02:01:49,200 --> 02:01:50,406
Open the door!

1633
02:01:51,240 --> 02:01:52,571
Please!

1634
02:01:54,560 --> 02:01:56,722
We need the door! We need
to barricade the door!

1635
02:02:00,640 --> 02:02:02,244
Marius! Marius!

1636
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:06,566
Take positions!

1637
02:02:09,960 --> 02:02:11,246
Steady, lads!

1638
02:02:13,200 --> 02:02:14,801
- Go!
- They're coming!

1639
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:43,251
Thank you!

1640
02:04:44,600 --> 02:04:46,762
Long live the revolution!

1641
02:04:51,200 --> 02:04:52,565
Here's a pretty ring.

1642
02:04:53,080 --> 02:04:54,081
Oh.

1643
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:55,561
Hello.

1644
02:04:59,200 --> 02:05:00,770
You're alive! I saved you!

1645
02:05:00,880 --> 02:05:02,405
You!

1646
02:05:08,760 --> 02:05:10,762
How do I get out of here?
It's that way!

1647
02:05:10,840 --> 02:05:12,763
All the way down
and to the left!

1648
02:05:55,280 --> 02:05:58,124
<i>It's you, Javert I
knew you wouldn't wait too long</i>

1649
02:05:58,640 --> 02:06:00,961
<i>The faithful servant
at his post once more</i>

1650
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:04,683
<i>This man's done no wrong
He needs a doctor's care</i>

1651
02:06:05,960 --> 02:06:09,726
<i>I warned you I would not give in!
I won't be swayed!</i>

1652
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:13,162
<i>Another hour yet Then I'm yours</i>

1653
02:06:13,480 --> 02:06:16,324
<i>All our debts are paid</i>

1654
02:06:17,880 --> 02:06:22,090
<i>The man of mercy comes again
And talks of justice!</i>

1655
02:06:22,240 --> 02:06:24,846
<i>Come, time is running short!</i>

1656
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:28,288
<i>Look down, Javert</i>

1657
02:06:28,440 --> 02:06:31,922
<i>He's standing in his grave!</i>

1658
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:49,088
One more step and you die.

1659
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:21,247
<i>Who is this man?
What sort of devil is he?</i>

1660
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:24,091
<i>To have me caught in a trap
and choose to let me go free?</i>

1661
02:07:24,280 --> 02:07:27,090
<i>It was his hour at last
to put a seal on my fate</i>

1662
02:07:27,280 --> 02:07:29,806
<i>Wipe out the past and wash
me clean off the slate</i>

1663
02:07:29,960 --> 02:07:32,440
<i>All it would take was
a flick of his knife</i>

1664
02:07:32,600 --> 02:07:36,571
<i>Vengeance was his
and he gave me back my life!</i>

1665
02:07:38,480 --> 02:07:40,767
<i>Damned if I live in
the debt of a thief!</i>

1666
02:07:40,960 --> 02:07:43,281
<i>Damned if I yield at
the end of the chase!</i>

1667
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:45,886
<i>I am the law and
the law is not mocked!</i>

1668
02:07:46,040 --> 02:07:48,088
<i>I'll spit his pity
right back in his face!</i>

1669
02:07:48,240 --> 02:07:50,766
<i>There is nothing on Earth
that we share!</i>

1670
02:07:50,920 --> 02:07:54,083
<i>It is either Valjean or Javert!</i>

1671
02:08:00,480 --> 02:08:03,245
<i>And my thoughts fly apart</i>

1672
02:08:04,640 --> 02:08:07,530
<i>Can this man be believed?</i>

1673
02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:11,929
<i>Shall his sins be forgiven?</i>

1674
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:18,848
<i>Shall his crimes be reprieved?</i>

1675
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:26,523
<i>And must I now begin to doubt</i>

1676
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:32,527
<i>Who never doubted
all these years?</i>

1677
02:08:32,720 --> 02:08:36,566
<i>My heart is stone
and still it trembles</i>

1678
02:08:36,720 --> 02:08:42,443
<i>The world I have known
is lost in shadow</i>

1679
02:08:42,600 --> 02:08:47,447
<i>Is he from heaven or from hell?</i>

1680
02:08:47,600 --> 02:08:51,321
<i>And does he know</i>

1681
02:08:51,480 --> 02:08:55,485
<i>That granting me my life today</i>

1682
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:07,326
<i>This man has killed me even so?</i>

1683
02:09:12,760 --> 02:09:17,322
<i>I am reaching but I fall</i>

1684
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:22,642
<i>And the stars
are black and cold</i>

1685
02:09:23,320 --> 02:09:29,851
<i>As I stare into the void
of a world that cannot hold</i>

1686
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:33,004
<i>I'll escape now from that world</i>

1687
02:09:33,200 --> 02:09:35,931
<i>From the world of Jean Valjean</i>

1688
02:09:36,120 --> 02:09:39,283
<i>There is nowhere I can turn</i>

1689
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:45,561
<i>There is no way to go on</i>

1690
02:10:14,520 --> 02:10:19,048
<i>Did
you see them going off to fight?</i>

1691
02:10:19,560 --> 02:10:23,531
<i>Children of the
barricade who didn't last the night</i>

1692
02:10:24,240 --> 02:10:28,882
<i>Did you see them
lying where they died?</i>

1693
02:10:29,040 --> 02:10:33,807
<i>Someone used to cradle them
and kiss them when they cried</i>

1694
02:10:33,960 --> 02:10:38,887
<i>Did you see them
lying side by side?</i>

1695
02:10:48,120 --> 02:10:51,761
<i>There's</i> a <i>grief
that can't be spoken</i>

1696
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:58,163
<i>There's a pain goes on and on</i>

1697
02:11:00,920 --> 02:11:04,766
<i>Empty chairs at empty tables</i>

1698
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:11,842
<i>Now my friends
are dead and gone</i>

1699
02:11:14,880 --> 02:11:19,124
<i>Here they talked of revolution</i>

1700
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:25,647
<i>Here it was they lit the flame</i>

1701
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:30,567
<i>Here they sang about tomorrow</i>

1702
02:11:31,800 --> 02:11:38,490
<i>And tomorrow never came</i>

1703
02:11:41,240 --> 02:11:46,201
<i>From the table in the corner</i>

1704
02:11:46,960 --> 02:11:52,091
<i>They could see a world reborn</i>

1705
02:11:52,160 --> 02:11:56,722
<i>And they rose
with voices ringing</i>

1706
02:11:56,880 --> 02:12:01,886
<i>And I can hear them now</i>

1707
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:07,008
<i>The very words
that they have sung</i>

1708
02:12:07,960 --> 02:12:13,000
<i>Became their last communion</i>

1709
02:12:16,720 --> 02:12:20,008
<i>On this lonely barricade</i>

1710
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,731
<i>At dawn</i>

1711
02:12:26,760 --> 02:12:31,288
<i>Oh, my friends,
my friends, forgive me</i>

1712
02:12:32,280 --> 02:12:37,081
<i>That I live and you are gone</i>

1713
02:12:37,240 --> 02:12:40,801
<i>There's a grief
that can't be spoken</i>

1714
02:12:41,200 --> 02:12:47,287
<i>There's a pain goes on and on</i>

1715
02:12:47,480 --> 02:12:51,644
<i>Phantom faces at the windows</i>

1716
02:12:51,800 --> 02:12:56,522
<i>Phantom shadows on the floor</i>

1717
02:12:56,680 --> 02:13:00,127
<i>Empty chairs at empty tables</i>

1718
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:06,248
<i>Where my friends
will meet no more</i>

1719
02:13:06,400 --> 02:13:10,724
<i>Oh, my friends, my friends</i>

1720
02:13:11,320 --> 02:13:14,608
<i>Don't ask me</i>

1721
02:13:14,760 --> 02:13:19,527
<i>What your sacrifice was for</i>

1722
02:13:20,280 --> 02:13:24,490
<i>Empty chairs at empty tables</i>

1723
02:13:27,200 --> 02:13:32,081
<i>Where my friends will sing</i>

1724
02:13:33,760 --> 02:13:34,260
<i>No more</i>

1725
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,810
<i>Every day you walk
with stronger step</i>

1726
02:14:04,960 --> 02:14:08,760
<i>You walk with longer step
The worst is over</i>

1727
02:14:08,920 --> 02:14:11,048
<i>Don't think about it, Marius!</i>

1728
02:14:11,120 --> 02:14:13,282
<i>With all the years ahead of us!</i>

1729
02:14:13,480 --> 02:14:15,562
<i>I will never go away</i>

1730
02:14:15,720 --> 02:14:19,850
<i>And we will be
together every day</i>

1731
02:14:22,680 --> 02:14:25,411
<i>Every day</i>

1732
02:14:26,280 --> 02:14:28,282
<i>We'll remember that night</i>

1733
02:14:28,440 --> 02:14:31,330
<i>And the vow that we made</i>

1734
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:37,369
<i>A heart full of love</i>

1735
02:14:37,760 --> 02:14:40,206
<i>She was never mine to keep</i>

1736
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:43,290
<i>A night full of you</i>

1737
02:14:43,640 --> 02:14:45,449
<i>She is youthful, she is free</i>

1738
02:14:45,560 --> 02:14:47,403
<i>The words are old
but always true</i>

1739
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,002
<i>Cosette, Cosette!</i>

1740
02:14:50,160 --> 02:14:51,525
<i>Love is the garden of the young</i>

1741
02:14:51,680 --> 02:14:53,120
<i>I saw you waiting and I knew</i>

1742
02:14:53,200 --> 02:14:55,009
<i>Thank God you are here</i>

1743
02:14:55,120 --> 02:14:56,884
<i>Waiting for you</i>

1744
02:14:57,040 --> 02:14:58,041
<i>Let it be</i>

1745
02:14:58,160 --> 02:14:59,207
<i>At your feet</i>

1746
02:14:59,400 --> 02:15:01,164
<i>Thank God you are home</i>

1747
02:15:01,360 --> 02:15:03,124
<i>Let it be</i>

1748
02:15:04,320 --> 02:15:07,642
<i>A heart full of love</i>

1749
02:15:07,760 --> 02:15:11,162
<i>And it wasn't a dream</i>

1750
02:15:11,640 --> 02:15:15,087
<i>This I give you this day</i>

1751
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:18,647
<i>Not a dream after all</i>

1752
02:15:25,360 --> 02:15:28,569
<i>Monsieur, this is a day
I never can forget</i>

1753
02:15:29,640 --> 02:15:33,645
<i>Is gratitude enough
for giving me Cosette?</i>

1754
02:15:34,160 --> 02:15:38,484
<i>Your home shall be with us
And not a day shall pass</i>

1755
02:15:38,640 --> 02:15:41,928
<i>But we will prove our love
To you, whom we shall call</i>

1756
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:46,085
<i>A father to us both
A father to us all</i>

1757
02:15:46,280 --> 02:15:48,328
<i>Not another word, my son</i>

1758
02:15:50,640 --> 02:15:54,725
<i>There's something now
that must be done</i>

1759
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:05,607
<i>There lived a man
whose name was Jean Valjean</i>

1760
02:16:09,120 --> 02:16:11,851
<i>He stole some bread to
save his sister's son</i>

1761
02:16:16,720 --> 02:16:20,088
<i>For 19 winters
he served his time</i>

1762
02:16:23,440 --> 02:16:27,286
<i>In sweat
he washed away his crime</i>

1763
02:16:29,680 --> 02:16:31,444
<i>Years ago</i>

1764
02:16:32,400 --> 02:16:35,449
<i>He broke parole and
lived a life apart</i>

1765
02:16:36,160 --> 02:16:39,004
<i>How could he tell Cosette
and break her heart?</i>

1766
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:41,161
Marius...

1767
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:43,123
<i>It's for Cosette
this must be faced</i>

1768
02:16:43,280 --> 02:16:45,931
<i>If he is caught,
she is disgraced</i>

1769
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:49,163
<i>The time has come to journey on</i>

1770
02:16:50,320 --> 02:16:55,087
<i>And from this day
he must be gone</i>

1771
02:16:57,360 --> 02:16:59,328
<i>Who am I?</i>

1772
02:17:01,760 --> 02:17:03,569
<i>Who am I?</i>

1773
02:17:04,840 --> 02:17:09,402
<i>You're Jean Valjean</i>

1774
02:17:10,880 --> 02:17:13,008
<i>Monsieur, you cannot leave</i>

1775
02:17:13,480 --> 02:17:17,087
<i>Whatever I tell my beloved
Cosette She will never believe</i>

1776
02:17:18,640 --> 02:17:21,484
<i>Tell her I've gone on a
journey A long way away</i>

1777
02:17:22,720 --> 02:17:25,564
<i>Tell her my heart was
too full for farewells</i>

1778
02:17:25,720 --> 02:17:27,802
<i>It is better this way</i>

1779
02:17:27,960 --> 02:17:30,611
<i>Promise me, monsieur
Cosette will never know</i>

1780
02:17:30,800 --> 02:17:33,007
<i>What I have spoken
Why I must go</i>

1781
02:17:36,800 --> 02:17:39,087
<i>For the sake of Cosette</i>

1782
02:17:41,600 --> 02:17:45,491
<i>It must be so</i>

1783
02:17:45,960 --> 02:17:47,564
Thank you, Marius.

1784
02:18:01,360 --> 02:18:04,091
<i>Where's he gone without a word?</i>

1785
02:18:04,240 --> 02:18:06,891
<i>That wouldn't be his way to go</i>

1786
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:08,963
<i>Why so sudden, why so strange?</i>

1787
02:18:09,120 --> 02:18:12,203
<i>Oh, did he say
how long he'll be gone?</i>

1788
02:18:12,360 --> 02:18:18,367
<i>AH he asked for me to say
is he's on a journey far away</i>

1789
02:18:18,840 --> 02:18:20,569
<i>He can't leave us now</i>

1790
02:18:21,560 --> 02:18:24,086
<i>How he breaks my heart</i>

1791
02:18:24,240 --> 02:18:30,202
<i>And we will never be apart</i>

1792
02:18:33,280 --> 02:18:35,044
I promise you.

1793
02:19:14,560 --> 02:19:18,406
The Baron and
Baroness du Thénard.

1794
02:19:19,760 --> 02:19:22,650
<i>Go away, Thenardier!</i>

1795
02:19:23,320 --> 02:19:26,767
<i>Do you think
I don't know who you are?</i>

1796
02:19:26,960 --> 02:19:30,362
<i>He's not fooled Told you so</i>

1797
02:19:30,520 --> 02:19:33,490
<i>Show monsieur
what you've come here to show</i>

1798
02:19:33,640 --> 02:19:36,291
<i>Tell the boy what you know</i>

1799
02:19:37,960 --> 02:19:40,691
<i>Pity to disturb you
at a feast like this</i>

1800
02:19:41,320 --> 02:19:44,642
<i>But 500 francs
surely wouldn't come amiss</i>

1801
02:19:44,800 --> 02:19:47,246
<i>In God's name,
say what you have to say</i>

1802
02:19:47,480 --> 02:19:49,721
<i>He speaks You pay!</i>

1803
02:19:50,120 --> 02:19:54,523
<i>What I saw, clear as light</i>

1804
02:19:54,680 --> 02:19:58,321
<i>Jean Valjean in
the sewers one night</i>

1805
02:19:58,640 --> 02:20:01,371
<i>Had this corpse on his back</i>

1806
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:04,842
<i>Some boy he had killed
in a vicious attack</i>

1807
02:20:05,800 --> 02:20:09,407
<i>I was there, never fear</i>

1808
02:20:09,560 --> 02:20:13,804
<i>I even found me
this fine souvenir</i>

1809
02:20:14,400 --> 02:20:17,210
<i>I know this This is mine</i>

1810
02:20:17,840 --> 02:20:21,083
<i>This is surely
some heavenly sign</i>

1811
02:20:21,720 --> 02:20:24,849
<i>Then it's true Then I'm right</i>

1812
02:20:25,240 --> 02:20:29,689
<i>Jean Valjean was
my savior that night</i>

1813
02:20:30,960 --> 02:20:34,760
<i>Jean Valjean, the old con</i>

1814
02:20:34,920 --> 02:20:38,083
<i>You pay up
or I'll say where he's gone</i>

1815
02:20:38,280 --> 02:20:39,566
Where is he?

1816
02:20:44,680 --> 02:20:45,761
Where is he?

1817
02:20:45,840 --> 02:20:47,046
The convent!

1818
02:20:47,840 --> 02:20:50,764
Cosette, come with me.
Come with me.

1819
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:54,251
<i>Watch the buggers
dance Watch 'em till they drop!</i>

1820
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:56,971
<i>Keep your wits about you
and you'll stand on top!</i>

1821
02:20:57,240 --> 02:20:59,925
<i>Masters of the land
Always get our share</i>

1822
02:21:00,080 --> 02:21:02,481
<i>Clear away the barricades
and we're still there</i>

1823
02:21:02,720 --> 02:21:05,451
<i>We know where
the wind is blowing</i>

1824
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:07,523
<i>Money is the stuff we smell</i>

1825
02:21:08,240 --> 02:21:09,526
<i>And when we're rich as Croesus</i>

1826
02:21:09,600 --> 02:21:11,728
<i>Jesus! Won't
we see you all in hell!</i>

1827
02:21:16,520 --> 02:21:18,010
How dare you!

1828
02:21:28,800 --> 02:21:32,361
<i>Alone I wait in the shadows</i>

1829
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,924
<i>I count the hours until I sleep</i>

1830
02:21:39,080 --> 02:21:43,449
<i>I dreamed a dream
Cosette stood by</i>

1831
02:21:43,640 --> 02:21:48,248
<i>It made her weep to know I die</i>

1832
02:21:52,960 --> 02:21:56,567
<i>Alone at the end of the day</i>

1833
02:21:58,560 --> 02:22:02,201
<i>Upon this wedding night I pray</i>

1834
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:09,131
<i>Take these children, my Lord,
to Thy embrace</i>

1835
02:22:10,400 --> 02:22:17,329
<i>And show them grace</i>

1836
02:22:20,960 --> 02:22:26,763
<i>God on high</i>

1837
02:22:29,600 --> 02:22:33,730
<i>Hear my prayer</i>

1838
02:22:37,960 --> 02:22:40,042
<i>Take me now</i>

1839
02:22:43,600 --> 02:22:45,682
<i>To Thy care</i>

1840
02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:53,489
<i>Where You are</i>

1841
02:22:55,320 --> 02:22:58,642
<i>Let me be</i>

1842
02:23:02,960 --> 02:23:06,009
<i>Take me now</i>

1843
02:23:09,120 --> 02:23:12,169
<i>Take me there</i>

1844
02:23:14,840 --> 02:23:18,561
<i>Bring me home</i>

1845
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:25,491
<i>Bring me home</i>

1846
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:34,001
Monsieur, <i>I bless your name</i>

1847
02:23:34,160 --> 02:23:36,242
<i>I am ready, Fantine</i>

1848
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:41,289
Monsieur, <i>lay down your burde</i>n

1849
02:23:41,560 --> 02:23:43,927
<i>At the end of my days</i>

1850
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:47,928
<i>You raised my child in love</i>

1851
02:23:48,080 --> 02:23:49,445
<i>She's the best of my life</i>

1852
02:23:49,640 --> 02:23:55,522
<i>And you will be with God</i>

1853
02:23:55,600 --> 02:23:56,726
Oh!

1854
02:23:59,560 --> 02:24:01,164
Oh...

1855
02:24:03,720 --> 02:24:05,245
Fantine.

1856
02:24:05,400 --> 02:24:08,290
<i>Papa, Papa, I do not understand</i>

1857
02:24:08,440 --> 02:24:11,489
<i>Are you all right?
Why did you go away?</i>

1858
02:24:14,400 --> 02:24:17,483
<i>Cosette, my child!
Am I forgiven now?</i>

1859
02:24:17,640 --> 02:24:20,086
<i>Thank God, thank God
I've lived to see this day!</i>

1860
02:24:21,400 --> 02:24:24,131
<i>It's you who must forgive
a thoughtless fool</i>

1861
02:24:24,280 --> 02:24:28,968
<i>It's you who must
forgive a thankless man</i>

1862
02:24:29,560 --> 02:24:33,246
<i>It's thanks to you
that I am living</i>

1863
02:24:33,640 --> 02:24:37,281
<i>And again I lay down
my life at your feet</i>

1864
02:24:37,720 --> 02:24:41,042
<i>Cosette, your father is a saint</i>

1865
02:24:41,680 --> 02:24:47,369
<i>When they wounded me
He took me from the barricade</i>

1866
02:24:47,880 --> 02:24:50,167
<i>Carried like a babe</i>

1867
02:24:50,360 --> 02:24:56,402
<i>And brought me home to you</i>

1868
02:25:07,200 --> 02:25:10,249
<i>Now you are here</i>

1869
02:25:14,720 --> 02:25:17,564
<i>Again beside me</i>

1870
02:25:21,440 --> 02:25:25,331
<i>Now I can die in peace</i>

1871
02:25:26,520 --> 02:25:31,242
<i>For now my life is blessed</i>

1872
02:25:32,320 --> 02:25:37,884
<i>You will live, Papa
You're going to live</i>

1873
02:25:38,120 --> 02:25:42,603
<i>It's too soon
Too soon to say goodbye</i>

1874
02:25:43,960 --> 02:25:50,002
<i>Yes, Cosette,
forbid me now to die!</i>

1875
02:25:51,480 --> 02:25:53,482
<i>I'll obey</i>

1876
02:25:56,120 --> 02:25:58,521
<i>I will try</i>

1877
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,446
<i>On this page</i>

1878
02:26:03,600 --> 02:26:07,685
<i>I write my last confession</i>

1879
02:26:10,960 --> 02:26:16,888
<i>Read it well
when I at last am sleeping</i>

1880
02:26:20,200 --> 02:26:22,248
<i>It's the story</i>

1881
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:27,000
<i>Of one who turned from hating</i>

1882
02:26:27,880 --> 02:26:31,043
<i>A man who only learned to love</i>

1883
02:26:31,640 --> 02:26:33,881
<i>When you were in his keeping</i>

1884
02:26:34,200 --> 02:26:35,804
I know it, Papa.

1885
02:26:37,080 --> 02:26:40,209
<i>Come with me</i>

1886
02:26:40,360 --> 02:26:44,046
<i>Where chains
will never bind you</i>

1887
02:26:44,200 --> 02:26:46,646
I am ready, Fantine.

1888
02:26:46,800 --> 02:26:53,809
<i>All your grief
At last, at last behind you</i>

1889
02:26:55,560 --> 02:26:58,609
<i>Lord in heaven</i>

1890
02:26:58,680 --> 02:27:03,527
<i>Look down on him in mercy</i>

1891
02:27:03,600 --> 02:27:06,524
<i>Forgive me all my trespasses</i>

1892
02:27:06,600 --> 02:27:09,922
<i>And take me to Your glory</i>

1893
02:27:12,760 --> 02:27:16,003
<i>Take my hand</i>

1894
02:27:16,080 --> 02:27:21,928
<i>I'll lead you to salvation</i>

1895
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:25,083
<i>Take my love</i>

1896
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:29,842
<i>For love is everlasting</i>

1897
02:27:31,440 --> 02:27:34,444
<i>And remember</i>

1898
02:27:34,720 --> 02:27:39,169
<i>The truth that once was spoken</i>

1899
02:27:39,880 --> 02:27:42,804
<i>To love another person</i>

1900
02:27:42,880 --> 02:27:49,490
<i>Is to see the face of God</i>

1901
02:27:52,080 --> 02:27:57,166
<i>Do you hear the people sing
lost in the valley of the night?</i>

1902
02:27:57,280 --> 02:28:03,686
<i>It is the music of a people
who are climbing to the light</i>

1903
02:28:03,800 --> 02:28:06,724
<i>For the wretched of the Earth</i>

1904
02:28:06,880 --> 02:28:09,804
<i>There is a flame
that never dies</i>

1905
02:28:09,960 --> 02:28:15,842
<i>Even the darkest night will
end and the sun will rise</i>

1906
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:19,083
<i>We will live again in freedom</i>

1907
02:28:19,280 --> 02:28:22,602
<i>In the garden of the Lord</i>

1908
02:28:22,760 --> 02:28:28,483
<i>We will walk behind the plowshare
We will put away the sword</i>

1909
02:28:28,960 --> 02:28:34,251
<i>The chain will be broken and all
men will have their reward!</i>

1910
02:28:34,400 --> 02:28:37,370
<i>Will you join in our crusade?</i>

1911
02:28:37,520 --> 02:28:40,364
<i>Who will be strong
and stand with me?</i>

1912
02:28:40,520 --> 02:28:43,444
<i>Somewhere beyond the barricade</i>

1913
02:28:43,560 --> 02:28:46,291
<i>Is there a world
you long to see?</i>

1914
02:28:46,440 --> 02:28:49,364
<i>Do you hear the people sing?</i>

1915
02:28:49,560 --> 02:28:52,404
<i>Say, do you hear
the distant drums?</i>

1916
02:28:52,560 --> 02:28:58,522
<i>It is the future that we bring
when tomorrow comes!</i>

1917
02:28:58,680 --> 02:29:01,365
<i>Will you join in our crusade?</i>

1918
02:29:01,520 --> 02:29:03,841
<i>Who will be strong
and stand with me?</i>

1919
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:07,004
<i>Somewhere beyond the barricade</i>

1920
02:29:07,080 --> 02:29:10,129
<i>Is there a world
you long to see?</i>

1921
02:29:10,280 --> 02:29:13,124
<i>Do you hear the people sing?</i>

1922
02:29:13,320 --> 02:29:16,324
<i>Say, do you hear
the distant drums?</i>

1923
02:29:16,480 --> 02:29:22,647
<i>It is the future that we bring
when tomorrow comes!</i>

1924
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:38,049
<i>Tomorrow comes!</i>
