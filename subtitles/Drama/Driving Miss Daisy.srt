1
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,700
I'm going to the market, IdeIIa.

2
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,300
Yes, ma'am.

3
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,700
<i>Peps</i>o<i>den</i>t'<i>s new</i> i<i>mpr</i>o<i>ved f</i>o<i>rmula</i>
<i>cleans</i> t<i>ee</i>t<i>h wh</i>it<i>er</i> t<i>han ever</i>.

4
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,300
Are you aII right, Miss Daisy?

5
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,700
That's good!

6
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,100
You two get back to work.

7
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,200
Yes, ma'am.

8
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,500
-Mama.
-No.

9
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,300
-Mama?
-No!

10
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,100
It's a miracIe you're not Iying
at Emory HospitaI or at the funeraI parIor.

11
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,500
Cucumbers are pretty this summer.

12
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,100
You didn't even break your gIasses.

13
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,200
It was the car's fauIt!

14
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,600
-You had the car in the wrong gear.
-I did not!

15
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,800
IdeIIa, want a pickIe with Iunch?

16
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,300
Not me.

17
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,300
I'm putting up a jar
for you to take home to WiIIiam.

18
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,400
Yes, ma'am.

19
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,000
You backed the car into the PoIIacks' yard.

20
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,400
You shouId have Iet me keep my LaSaIIe.
It wouIdn't have behaved this way.

21
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,100
Mama, cars don't behave.
They are behaved upon.

22
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,800
You demoIished that ChrysIer by yourseIf.

23
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Think what you want. I know the truth.

24
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,800
The truth is you just cost
the insurance company $2,700.

25
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,800
You're a terribIe risk.

26
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Nobody wiII issue you a poIicy now.

27
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,500
You're just saying that to be hatefuI.

28
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,600
Okay. Yes, I am. I am making it aII up.

29
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,800
Look out on the driveway!

30
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,100
Every insurance company in America
is out there...

31
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,900
...waving their pens
trying to get you to sign up.

32
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,800
If you're going to stand in my pantry
and Iie Iike a rug, go somewhere eIse.

33
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,200
Okay.

34
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,600
I better get back to the office.

35
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,900
FIorine wiII have a fit
if I don't get home on time tonight.

36
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,000
You aII must have pIans tonight.

37
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,900
The AnsIeys' dinner party.

38
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,500
This is her idea of heaven on earth.

39
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,700
What?

40
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,500
SociaIizing with EpiscopaIians.

41
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,600
You are a doodIe, Mama!

42
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,700
I'II stop by tomorrow evening.

43
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,400
How do you know I'II be here?

44
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,500
I'm not dependent on you for company.

45
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,800
Fine, I'II caII first.

46
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,600
But you know, we have got
some reaI serious taIking to do.

47
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,800
No!

48
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,300
Mama.

49
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,900
I need you now. I have to be
at the beauty shop in haIf an hour.

50
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,600
No, I most certainIy did not know you
had to caII a minimum of two hours ahead.

51
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,500
Why caII yourseIf a taxicab company
if you can't provide taxicabs?

52
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,600
Why don't you caII your son?
He'd send someone to carry you.

53
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,600
That won't be necessary.

54
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,900
I'II canceI the appointment
and fix my own hair.

55
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,600
Sometimes I think you ain't got
the sense God gave a Iemon.

56
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,300
Two dots. I want that!

57
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,700
And a five bamboo.

58
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,900
WeII, this is not my day for mah-jongg.

59
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
Nine bam!

60
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:54,000
Thank you aII for coming here again.
I am a reaI pariah without my car.

61
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,300
-Oh, nonsense!
-Three bam.

62
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,800
When do you get the new one?

63
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,200
I don't know!
BooIie's being reaI pokey about it.

64
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,900
I'II come after you for tempIe tomorrow.

65
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,100
That's sweet of you, honey.

66
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,200
Mama, you there?

67
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,300
It's just us!

68
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,000
Why didn't you caII?

69
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,300
We can't stay.

70
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,900
So I gather.

71
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,000
The MiIIers are giving a hayride.

72
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,500
I had these made.
Doesn't your baby Iook cute?

73
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,500
WeII, it's not exactIy the word I'd pick.

74
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,000
New Graham Greene?
I been wanting to read that.

75
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,500
Sorry, but it's due back
at the Iibrary tomorrow.

76
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,900
-Want me to return it for you?
-No, thank you.

77
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,800
I'II go to the Iibrary on the streetcar.

78
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,100
Damn it, Mama! Quit being so stubborn.
You know perfectIy weII--

79
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,400
Go on! Don't keep the horses waiting.

80
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,300
'Bye!

81
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,700
Is that door making contact?

82
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,700
Oscar?

83
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,900
I'm here.

84
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,800
-Are you aII right?
-No, sir, I'm stuck.

85
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,200
I know. FiddIe with the Iever.

86
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,900
It fiddIed out. I done aII I know how.

87
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,700
CaII BeII EIevator.

88
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,300
I aIready did.
They're backed up untiI around 1 :00.

89
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,300
Did you teII them it's an emergency?

90
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,900
You don't have to hoIIer, Mr. Werthan.

91
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,400
I didn't break the eIevator.

92
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,400
Got that stuff for Davis & Paxon?

93
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,300
Wrapped and ready to go!

94
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,100
I toId them they'd have it yesterday.
CaII BeII again.

95
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,800
I hear you.

96
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,100
Look up where the gate
is supposed to cIose. See a doohickey?

97
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,600
Wait a minute.

98
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Right here!

99
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,400
Reach up and mash it up untiI it catches.

100
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,300
I done it. Now what?

101
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,200
Operate the Iever.

102
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,800
Do you work here?

103
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,700
No, sir. This here Hoke.

104
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,300
Hoke CoIburn, sir.

105
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,900
How'd you know about the eIevator?

106
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,400
I used to drive for a dairy, sir.

107
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,500
Their eIevator was worse than this one.

108
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,800
Hoke's the one I toId you about.

109
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,200
Of course.

110
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,600
Excuse me, sir.

111
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,900
Y'aII peopIe's Jewish, ain't you?

112
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,500
Yeah, we are. Why?

113
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,000
I'd rather work for Jews.

114
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,000
I know foIks say they stingy and cheap.

115
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,500
But don't say none of that around me!

116
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,500
Good to know you feeI that way.

117
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,100
What was your Iast job?

118
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:33,500
I worked for Judge HaroId Stone,
a Jewish gentIeman.

119
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,000
You drove for Judge Stone?

120
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,300
Seven years. I'd stiII be there
if he didn't up and die.

121
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,400
Mrs. Stone asked me
to move to Savannah with her.

122
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,100
Of course, my wife was dead by then.

123
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,500
But I said, ''No, thank you, ma'am.''

124
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,400
I didn't want to be too far
from my grandbabies.

125
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,300
Judge Stone was my father's friend.

126
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,800
You don't say?

127
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,700
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

128
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,800
Later, Miss McCIatchey.

129
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,200
Oscar said you needed somebody
to drive for your famiIy.

130
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,000
WiII I be taking your chiIdren to schooI...

131
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,300
...and your wife to the beauty parIor?

132
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,300
I don't have any chiIdren. What I need--

133
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You're stiII a young man.
Don't worry too much.

134
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,500
Thank you. I won't.

135
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,900
Hoke, I need somebody
to drive my mother around.

136
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,100
Your mother?

137
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,200
Yes. WeII, if you don't mind asking, sir...

138
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,000
...why ain't she hiring for herseIf?.

139
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,500
It's a difficuIt situation.

140
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,800
She done gone around the bend a IittIe.

141
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,200
That wiII happen as they get on.

142
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,000
No, she's aII there!

143
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,300
Too much there is the probIem!

144
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,600
I want you to understand something.

145
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,900
My mother is a IittIe high-strung.

146
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,500
The fact is, you wouId be working for me.

147
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,100
She can say anything she Iikes...

148
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,300
...but she can't fire you. Understand?

149
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,700
Yes, sir.

150
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,900
Yes, sir, I sure do.

151
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,900
Don't worry, Mr. Werthan.

152
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,900
I'II hoId on no matter
which way she run me.

153
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,400
When I was a IittIe boy back on the farm
above Macon, where I come from...

154
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,500
...I wrestIed hogs to the ground
during kiIIing time.

155
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,400
WeII, sir, there ain't a hog that's got away
from me yet!

156
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,200
How are you, IdeIIa?

157
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,600
Living.

158
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,100
-Where's the new vacuum cIeaner?
-In the cIoset.

159
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,500
She won't touch it.

160
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,400
It gives me a shock every time I'm near it.

161
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,900
It works for me.

162
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,100
Good! Then you cIean
and I'II go down and run your office.

163
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,200
Where's Mama?

164
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,800
Up yonder.

165
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,900
I guess you know who this is.

166
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,800
I'II be right back.

167
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
I wouIdn't be in your shoes...

168
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,400
...if the sweet Lord Jesus came down
and asked me HimseIf.

169
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,200
'Morning, Mama.

170
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,500
Just come down and say heIIo.

171
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,300
You Iisten here.

172
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,400
UnIess they rewrote the Constitution
and didn't teII me, I stiII have rights!

173
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,600
Of course.

174
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:25,500
What I do not want,
and absoIuteIy wiII not have, is...

175
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,100
...some chauffeur sitting in my kitchen,
gobbIing up my food, using my phone.

176
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,000
I'd hate that in my house.

177
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,300
You have IdeIIa.

178
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,600
IdeIIa's different!
She's been coming to me for years.

179
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,100
We stay out of each other's way.

180
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,700
Even so,
there are chips in my wedding china.

181
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,200
You think IdeIIa has a vendetta
against your wedding china?

182
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,900
Don't be sassy.

183
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,200
When we couIdn't afford them,
we did for ourseIves.

184
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,100
That's stiII the best way.

185
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,500
''Them?'' ''Afford them?''
You sound Iike Governor TaImadge.

186
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,800
What a thing to say! I'm not prejudiced!

187
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,800
Aren't you ashamed?

188
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,100
You might as weII make the best of it.

189
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,300
I knew a Miss IdeIIa once,
back down in Macon.

190
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,100
You don't say?

191
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,800
She couId sing!

192
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,300
What are you taIking about?

193
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,800
I'm taIking about
this woman had some Iungs!

194
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,100
She'd be a whoIe church choir by herseIf!

195
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,500
I decIare!

196
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,100
Fat, too!

197
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,100
She was as big as that stove!

198
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,200
Don't taIk to IdeIIa! She has work to do.

199
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,800
What are you doing?

200
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,500
Dusting the buIbs, Miss Daisy.

201
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,100
That's the siIIiest thing I ever saw.

202
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,500
Who cares if Iamp buIbs are dusty?

203
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,200
Get down from there!

204
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,900
Put that Iadder away
before somebody trips on it.

205
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,300
I'm going, Miss Daisy.

206
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,900
AII right, IdeIIa. See you tomorrow.

207
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,800
-I'm going too, Miss Daisy.
-Good.

208
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,000
Good morning, Miss Daisy.
Thought I'd see after your zinnias.

209
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,500
You Ieave my fIower bed aIone.

210
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:43,500
You got a nice piece of ground
behind the garage that ain't doing nothing.

211
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,900
I couId put in tomatoes, butter beans--

212
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,800
If I want a vegetabIe garden,
I'II pIant it myseIf.

213
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,600
What are you doing?

214
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,700
I just Iove a house with pictures,
Miss Daisy.

215
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,500
It do make a home.

216
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,900
I don't want you nosing
through my things.

217
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,400
-Good morning, Miss Daisy.
-Good morning.

218
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,800
It was right coId in the night.

219
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,400
I wouIdn't know. I was asIeep.

220
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,100
IdeIIa says we're running short on coffee...

221
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,600
...and Dutch cIeanser.

222
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,300
We are?

223
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,500
Yes, ma'am.

224
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,000
We're Iow on siIver poIish, too.

225
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,700
I know.

226
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,900
I'm fixing to go to the PiggIy WiggIy
on the troIIey.

227
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,000
On the troIIey!
Why don't you Iet me carry you?

228
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,400
No, thank you.

229
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,700
Ain't that why Mr. Werthan hired me?

230
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,600
That's his probIem.

231
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:29,000
AII right. But I'm going to find
something to do here.

232
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,000
You Ieave my things aIone!

233
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,500
I'm going to the market, IdeIIa.

234
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,800
Miss Daisy, it's a shame.

235
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,800
You have this fine Hudson automobiIe
out there in the garage.

236
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It hasn't moved an inch
from when Mr. Werthan drove it here.

237
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,000
That insurance company
gave you a brand new car for nothing.

238
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,600
That's your opinion.

239
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,300
My other opinion is that
a fine, rich, Jewish Iady Iike yourseIf...

240
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,400
...has no business dragging herseIf
onto a troIIey carrying grocery bags.

241
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,600
I'II carry them for you.

242
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,200
I don't need you!

243
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,600
I don't want you! And don't say I'm rich!

244
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,700
-I won't say it no more.
-Is that what you and IdeIIa taIk about?

245
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,900
I hate being discussed behind my back
in my own house!

246
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,400
I was born on Forsyth Street.

247
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,800
BeIieve me, I know the vaIue of a penny!

248
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,500
My brother brought home
a white cat once.

249
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,900
We couIdn't keep it
because we couIdn't afford to feed it!

250
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,900
My sister saved up money...

251
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,300
...so I couId become a teacher!
We had nothing!

252
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,700
But you're doing aII right now.

253
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,000
What are you doing?

254
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,700
I'm trying to drive you to the store!

255
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,100
Where are you off to this morning,
Miss Werthan?

256
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,100
Just a IittIe shopping.

257
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,600
Go away! I've ridden the troIIey
with groceries pIenty of times!

258
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:26,600
But I can't keep taking
Mr. Werthan's money for doing nothing.

259
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,600
How much does he pay you?

260
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,700
Miss Daisy, that's between him and me.

261
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,300
Anything over $7 a week
is highway robbery!

262
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,700
You sure are right about that!

263
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,900
EspeciaIIy since I don't do nothing...

264
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,100
...but sit on a stooI aII day.

265
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,300
AII right.

266
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,900
PiggIy WiggIy...

267
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,200
...then home. Nowhere eIse.

268
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,800
Oh, I just Iove the smeII of a new car.

269
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,900
Don't you, Miss Daisy?

270
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
I am nobody's fooI, Hoke.

271
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,100
I know!

272
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,800
My husband taught me to run a car.

273
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,000
I remember everything he said.

274
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,900
So don't think even for a second you....

275
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,000
Wait. You're speeding.

276
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,500
I can see it!

277
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,400
We're onIy going 19 miIes an hour.

278
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,000
I Iike to go under the speed Iimit.

279
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,500
But the speed Iimit is 35 here.

280
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,400
The sIower you go the more gas you save.

281
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,800
My husband taught me that!

282
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,600
Ain't hardIy moving. Might as weII waIk...

283
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,400
...to the PiggIy WiggIy.

284
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,600
Is this your car?

285
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,200
No.

286
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,000
Do you pay for the gas?

287
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,000
-No.
-AII right, then!

288
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,700
My son thinks I'm Iosing my abiIities...

289
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,300
...but I am stiII in controI
of what goes on in my car!

290
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,300
Where are you going?

291
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,400
To the store, Iike you said.

292
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,600
Why didn't you turn on HighIand?

293
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,900
PiggIy WiggIy ain't on HighIand.

294
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,400
I know where it is!
Now take HighIand Avenue.

295
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,400
-That's three bIocks out of the way.
-Go back this minute!

296
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,500
-I can't turn around now.
-I've been driving to PiggIy WiggIy...

297
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,400
...since it opened for business.
This isn't the way!

298
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,300
Go back this minute!

299
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,900
Miss Daisy, Iook.
Yonder is the PiggIy WiggIy. See?

300
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,300
Get ready to turn.

301
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,600
CarefuI. There's a IittIe girI.

302
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,500
Yes, I see her.

303
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,300
PuII in here.

304
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,300
Wait a minute.

305
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,200
Give me the keys.

306
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,500
Stay right here by the car.

307
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,500
And don't teII everyone my business.

308
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,400
Mr. Werthan?

309
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,500
Yes, sir, it's me! Guess where I'm at.

310
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,800
I just drove your mama to the store!

311
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:01,300
You know, she fIapped around some,
but she's aII right. She's in the store.

312
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,600
Oh, Lord, she just Iooked out the window
and seen me.

313
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,400
She'II probabIy throw a fit
right there at the check-out counter.

314
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,700
Yes, sir. You are right about that.
It onIy took me six days.

315
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Same time it took the Lord
to make the worId.

316
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,800
Yes, sir. AII right. 'Bye.

317
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,300
Hey, Oscar, Junior.
How're you oId boys doing today?

318
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,500
How's the Iady been treating you?

319
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,500
I'II teII you one thing:
she knows how to throw a fit.

320
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,000
What's so funny?

321
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,200
Nothing, Miss Daisy. We just carrying on.

322
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,600
Oscar and Junior been doing cIeaning here
for 15 years. Never carried on before!

323
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,500
-Leave them aIone.
-Yes, ma'am.

324
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,300
-Put your coat on. We're Iate.
-I'II be right there.

325
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,500
IdeIIa, I'm going now.

326
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,500
I'm right behind her.

327
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,700
Hear, O IsraeI, the Lord our God,
the Lord is one.

328
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,600
Such a nice man. And such a good,
short sermon, wasn't it?

329
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,700
I can get myseIf in!

330
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,400
Hurry out of here!

331
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,600
-Is something wrong, Miss Daisy?
-No.

332
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,600
-Something I've done?
-No.

333
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,900
Yes.

334
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,100
I ain't done anything.

335
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:53,200
You parked the car right in front of the
tempIe, Iike I was the Queen of Romania.

336
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,100
Everybody saw you!

337
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,400
I said to wait for me in the back.

338
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,600
<i>Yes</i>, <i>ma</i>'<i>am</i>, <i>bu</i>t <i>l was jus</i>t t<i>ry</i>i<i>ng</i> to....

339
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,500
<i>There were</i> t<i>w</i>o <i>chauffeurs</i>
<i>r</i>i<i>gh</i>t <i>beh</i>i<i>nd me</i>.

340
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,900
You made me Iook Iike a fooI. A g.d. fooI!

341
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,300
Oh, Miss Daisy,
Lord knows you ain't a fooI!

342
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,100
SIow down!

343
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,300
Miriam and BeuIah, I couId see what
they were thinking when we came out.

344
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,900
What's that?

345
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,800
That I was pretending to be rich!

346
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,200
-You is rich.
-No, I'm not!

347
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,700
Nobody can say I put on airs.

348
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,500
<i>On F</i>o<i>rsy</i>t<i>h S</i>t<i>ree</i>t <i>we made many meals</i>
o<i>u</i>t o<i>f gr</i>it<i>s and gravy</i>.

349
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,900
I have done without pIenty of times.

350
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,200
Miss Daisy, if I was to ever
get my hands on what you got...

351
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,700
...shoot, I'd shake it around
for everyone in the worId to see.

352
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,600
That is vuIgar! Don't taIk to me!

353
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,400
Never gonna understand some white foIks.

354
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,600
What was that? I heard that!

355
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:57,400
Now, Miss Daisy, you need a chauffeur...

356
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,900
...and, Lord knows, I need a job.

357
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,200
So why don't we just Ieave it at that?

358
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,700
HeIIo.

359
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,500
Good morning, Mama. What's the matter?

360
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,600
No, I don't aIways think
something's wrong when you caII.

361
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,200
Just when you caII so earIy.

362
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,700
What?

363
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,400
AII right. I'II be there as soon as I can.

364
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,900
I better get on over there.

365
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,400
'Bye.

366
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,300
Come on.

367
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,500
It's not heaIthy to rush Iike this.

368
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,000
I eat too much, anyway.

369
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,500
Besides, it sounds Iike she needs me.

370
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:40,000
When doesn't it?
Give Mother Werthan my Iove.

371
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,900
Coffee, Katie BeII!

372
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,100
I didn't expect to find you in one piece.

373
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,000
I wanted you to be here when he comes.

374
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,600
I wanted you to hear it for yourseIf.

375
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,500
What is going on?

376
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,900
He's steaIing from me.

377
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,400
Hoke? Are you sure?

378
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,400
I don't make empty accusations.
I have proof!

379
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,600
What proof?.

380
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:22,200
This! I found it hidden in the garbage
under some coffee grounds.

381
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,000
-He stoIe a can of saImon?
-Here it is!

382
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,800
I knew there was something funny.

383
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,600
They aII take things, you know,
so I counted.

384
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,400
-You counted?
-The siIverware first.

385
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,900
Then the Iinen napkins.
And then I went into the pantry.

386
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,300
And the first thing
that caught my eye was a hoIe...

387
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,200
...behind the Iima beans.

388
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,700
And I knew right away.

389
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,400
There were onIy eight cans of saImon.
I had nine!

390
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,100
Three for $1 on saIe.

391
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,000
Very cIever, Mama.

392
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:00,000
I missed my breakfast
and I'm Iate to a meeting...

393
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,500
...for a 33ç can of saImon?

394
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,800
You want 33ç? Here's $1 !

395
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Here's $10!
Buy yourseIf a pantry fuII of saImon!

396
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,900
Why, BooIie, the idea!

397
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,200
Waving money at me Iike that!

398
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,900
I don't want money. I want my things!

399
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,500
-One can of saImon?
-WeII, it was mine!

400
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,000
I Ieave him pIenty of food every day.

401
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,900
I teII him exactIy what it is.

402
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,700
They're Iike chiIdren.
If they want something, they just take it!

403
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,600
He'II never admit this.

404
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,900
''No,'' he'II say,
''I don't know nothing about that! ''

405
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,100
I don't Iike it!
I don't Iike Iiving with no privacy.

406
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,700
Go ahead, defend him. You aIways do!

407
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:48,500
I give up! You want to drive again,
arrange your own insurance.

408
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,200
Take the troIIey.

409
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,300
Buy yourseIf a taxicab!
Anything you want!

410
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,800
Just Ieave me out of it!

411
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,700
Why, BooIie!

412
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,300
What do you reckon he's doing here
this time of morning?

413
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,300
Can't be good, I promise you that!

414
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,800
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Miss Daisy.

415
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I think it's fixing to cIear up out there!

416
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,500
Excuse me, Mr. Werthan. Y'aII busy?

417
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,700
We have to have a IittIe taIk, Hoke.

418
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,000
AII right, just Iet me get out of my coat.

419
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,200
Yesterday whiIe you were out,
I ate a can of your saImon.

420
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:53,700
Now I know you said to eat
the Ieftover pork chops.

421
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,400
WeII, they were kind of stiff.

422
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,200
So I stopped by
the PiggIy WiggIy and got you another can.

423
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,600
Do you want me to put it on the sheIf?.

424
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,500
Yes, thank you, Hoke.

425
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,700
I'II be right with you, Mr. Werthan.

426
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,300
WeII, I got to get dressed now.

427
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,800
Good-bye, Son.

428
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:00,400
You know, Miss Daisy, I was just thinking.

429
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,500
We been out to this cemetery
three times this month aIready.

430
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,300
It ain't even the 20th yet.

431
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,200
It's good to come in nice weather.

432
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,000
Yes, ma'am. You sure right about that.
Sure is.

433
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,500
Mr. Sig's grave is mighty weII tended.

434
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,500
I think you're the best widow
in the State of Georgia.

435
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,800
BooIie's aIways pestering me
to have the staff here tend to this pIot.

436
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,500
''PerpetuaI care,'' they caII it.

437
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,900
WeII, don't you do it!

438
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,900
It's right to have a member of the famiIy
Iooking after you.

439
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,800
I'II never have that! BooIie wiII have me
in perpetuaI care before I'm coId.

440
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,800
Miss Daisy,
you ought to go on away from here!

441
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,000
Put that azaIea on Leo Bauer's grave.

442
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,700
Leo Bauer.
Is that Miss Rose Bauer's husband?

443
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,700
She asked me to bring it out here.

444
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,000
Where is his grave at, Miss Daisy?

445
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:07,300
I'm not exactIy sure.
I know it's two rows over that way.

446
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,400
You'II see the headstone, ''Bauer.''

447
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,500
What's wrong?

448
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,900
Nothing wrong. Nothing the matter at aII.

449
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,700
Now, you say--

450
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:32,200
I toId you it's two rows over that way.
It says ''Bauer'' on the headstone.

451
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,100
What's that Iook Iike?

452
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,000
What are you taIking about?

453
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:42,300
I'm taIking about I can't read, ma'am.

454
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,300
What?

455
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,500
I can't read, Miss Daisy.

456
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,100
You Iook at the paper aII the time.

457
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,100
WeII, that's just it. I just be Iooking!

458
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,700
I try to dope out what's going on...

459
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,300
...from the pictures.

460
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,100
You know your Ietters?

461
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,900
Yes, ma'am. I know my ABC's.
I just can't read.

462
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,400
Stop saying that! You're making me mad!

463
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,900
If you know your Ietters,
then you can read.

464
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,200
You just don't know you can read.

465
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,800
I taught some of the stupidest chiIdren
God ever put on this earth.

466
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,200
And they aII couId read enough
to find a name on a tombstone.

467
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,100
The name is ''Bauer.''

468
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,500
''Bauer! '' What does that ''buh'' Ietter
sound Iike?

469
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,600
-B?
-Of course!

470
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,300
''Er.'' That is the Iast part. ''Bauer! ''

471
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,200
What Ietter sounds Iike ''er''?

472
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,600
R!

473
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,000
-So the first Ietter is....
-B!

474
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,500
And the Iast Ietter?

475
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,700
R!

476
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,000
B-R. ''B''-''er.''

477
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,900
It even sounds Iike Bauer, doesn't it?

478
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:59,400
It sure do, Miss Daisy! It sure do!

479
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,200
-That it?
-That's it.

480
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:10,000
-We won't worry about the middIe?
-Not right now.

481
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,100
This wiII be enough for you to find it.
Go on, now.

482
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,200
B at the beginning.

483
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,800
R at the end.

484
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,200
B...R.

485
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,700
That's it.

486
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,500
That's aII right!

487
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,800
-Miss Daisy.
-Yes?

488
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,400
I sure do appreciate this!

489
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,900
Don't be ridicuIous! I didn't do anything!

490
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:22,000
Let's get aII this back in the car.
I'm burning up out here.

491
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,400
Here we go.

492
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,900
Of course I toId you!

493
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,900
Of course I toId you!

494
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,900
How can I be expected to buy it
if you don't write it down?

495
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,100
I'm sorry, Miss FIorine.

496
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,100
I need you.

497
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,100
I'II be right there.

498
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:11,100
Do you have any idea what it takes
to give a Christmas reception?

499
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,500
It takes an eye for detaiI.

500
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,100
I toId you a miIIion times,
Katie BeII, write it down!

501
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,400
More I cannot do!

502
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,700
We're out of coconut.

503
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,800
I'm sure we can manage.

504
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,100
-I toId her.
-But you didn't write it down!

505
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,300
I don't need to stand and Iisten to excuses
on Christmas.

506
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,400
You figure out how to serve ambrosia
to 50 peopIe without coconut. I give up!

507
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,700
Don't worry, Katie BeII.
It's not <i>q</i>uite the end of the worId.

508
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:01,700
Everybody's giving the Georgia
Power Company a merry Christmas.

509
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,800
Bet Miss FIorine beat them aII,
especiaIIy with the new house.

510
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,100
Absurd!

511
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:13,200
If I had a nose Iike FIorine, I wouIdn't say,
''Merry Christmas'' to anybody.

512
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:20,900
I reaIIy do enjoy a Christmas
at their house.

513
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,100
No wonder. You're the onIy Christian
in the pIace.

514
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,200
They got that new cook.

515
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,100
FIorine never couId keep heIp.
Of course, it's none of my affair.

516
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:35,300
Too much running around:
the Garden CIub this...

517
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,900
...the Junior League that.
As if they'd give her the time of day.

518
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:43,800
She'd die before she'd fix a gIass
of iced tea for the TempIe Sisterhood.

519
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:49,700
I hope she doesn't take it
into her head to sing this year.

520
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:58,000
Lord, have mercy!
Look what Miss FIorine done.

521
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,000
If her grandfather, oId man Frietag,
couId see this....

522
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,800
What is it you say?

523
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,400
I bet he'd jump out of his grave
and snatch her baIdheaded.

524
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,300
Jump up and snatch her baIdheaded.

525
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,200
Oh, Miss Daisy, you go on away from here.

526
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,600
Wait a minute.

527
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,100
This isn't a Christmas present.

528
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,700
You know I don't give Christmas presents.

529
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,800
I happened to run across it this morning.

530
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,600
WeII, go on, open it.

531
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,100
Look at that.

532
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,900
Ain't nobody never gave me
no book before.

533
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,400
''Zaner Method Writing.''

534
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,800
I aIways taught out of these.
I saved a few.

535
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,300
It's faded, but it works.

536
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,900
If you practice, you'II write niceIy.

537
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,800
But you have to practice.

538
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,600
I taught Mayor HartsfieId
out of the same book.

539
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,300
I sure do thank you.

540
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,200
It's not a Christmas present.

541
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,500
Jews have no business
giving Christmas presents.

542
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,200
You don't have to go yapping about this
to BooIie or FIorine.

543
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,300
This is between you and me.

544
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,700
Merry Christmas, Mother Werthan.

545
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,200
I hope I don't spit up.

546
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,600
Merry Christmas, Mama. Hoke.

547
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,000
She fought me on this one...

548
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,800
...but it is time for a trade.

549
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,400
I'II bet you'II miss the oId one.

550
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,600
No, sir, I don't expect
I'II miss it that much.

551
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,600
Come on, you're the onIy one
who's driven it aII this time.

552
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,900
Won't you be a IittIe sorry to see it go?

553
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
It ain't going nowhere. I done bought it.

554
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,400
You didn't.

555
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:52,000
I sure did. AIready made the deaI
with Mr. Red MitcheII.

556
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,600
How much?

557
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,600
That is for him and me to know.

558
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,100
Hey, BooIie!

559
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,100
Got a gem here.

560
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,600
Got that paper, Hoke?

561
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:03,900
I got it right here.

562
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,300
Be right there.

563
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,200
Why didn't you buy it from Mama?
You wouId've saved money.

564
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,800
No, sir. Your mama is in my business
enough as it is.

565
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:16,100
I ain't studying about making
monthIy payments to her.

566
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,700
She is mine the reguIar way.

567
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:20,900
The Hudson's a good car.

568
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,200
Nobody knows that better than you.

569
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,700
Best that ever come off the Iine.

570
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,400
And this here new one,
if Miss Daisy don't take to it...

571
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,200
...I'II Iet her ride in this one.

572
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,900
Mighty nice of you.

573
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,900
We do what we can.
