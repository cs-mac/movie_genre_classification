1
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,536
Are you the doctor?

2
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:42,174
Yes. Climb on.

3
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,134
Rouault's one of the richest
around here.

4
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:49,854
He broke his leg after a night's
drinking.

5
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,210
It's that way.

6
00:00:55,979 --> 00:00:57,811
His wife died 2 years ago.

7
00:00:58,019 --> 00:01:00,772
His daughter runs the house now.

8
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:11,734
Wait.

9
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,574
Follow me.

10
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:51,416
Oh, excuse me!

11
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,607
The doctor, father.

12
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,895
Doctor, I've broken my leg.

13
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:10,371
Let's have a look at it.

14
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,415
It's a neat fracture, nice and
clean.

15
00:02:19,059 --> 00:02:21,493
I'll make you a splint.

16
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,170
We'll need to have some little
pads made too.

17
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,533
Can you do that, Emma?

18
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,538
This should do it.

19
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,615
- Will it take long to set?
- Two months.

20
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,414
Perhaps less. I'll call back to see
you...

21
00:03:10,619 --> 00:03:11,529
in three days.

22
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,171
Emma, show the doctor out.

23
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,053
Good-bye, mademoiselle.

24
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,851
I'd like to know your name.

25
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,528
Charbovari.

26
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,097
Pardon me?

27
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,457
Charles Bovary.

28
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,571
See you in three days, doctor.

29
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,695
M. Rouault. What a surprise!

30
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,130
Look. A doctor in Yvetot couldn't
have done better.

31
00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:09,533
Even one in Rouen!

32
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:11,651
Here.

33
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,379
Here's what I owe you.

34
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,854
I don't owe you this but I'm happy
to give it to you.

35
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:24,489
You're a widower too, I hear.

36
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,851
Yes, for eight months now.

37
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:32,049
When I lost my poor wife...

38
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,847
I'd go to the fields to be alone.

39
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,573
I'd fall at the foot of a tree,
crying...

40
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,775
and raving at the good Lord.

41
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:44,890
When I thought of others holding
their dear wives...

42
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,457
I nearly went crazy.

43
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:53,575
I'd hit the ground with my stick. I
couldn't eat.

44
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,847
You won't believe me...

45
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,779
but the idea of going to the cafe
sickened me.

46
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,094
And then, slowly...

47
00:05:03,739 --> 00:05:05,650
one day followed another...

48
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,013
spring followed winter and
autumn came after summer...

49
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,539
it faded away...

50
00:05:13,219 --> 00:05:15,688
it drained away bit by bit...

51
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,416
it went away.

52
00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:21,298
Stir yourself, M. Bovary.

53
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,008
You'll see, you'll get over it.

54
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:26,972
Yes, I'm sure I will.

55
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:28,214
Come and see us.

56
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,888
My daughter...

57
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:32,532
talks of you sometimes...

58
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,178
she says you've forgotten her.

59
00:05:36,179 --> 00:05:39,489
We'll ferret out a rabbit for you,
to cheer you up.

60
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:02,217
Monsieur Charles! How kind to
come and see us.

61
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:06,217
Father's running around all over
the place, thanks to you.

62
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,299
Let me offer you a drink.

63
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,818
No, thank you.

64
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,412
Really.

65
00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:15,128
Come on, let's drink. I'm thirsty.

66
00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:20,767
I'm disturbing you...

67
00:06:48,859 --> 00:06:51,214
I've had dizzy spells for a month
now.

68
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:55,450
Would sea-bathing do me good?

69
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:56,979
Sea-bathing?

70
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,690
That's good... for dizzy spells.

71
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,294
At the convent, I'd pretend to
faint.

72
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,169
The nuns would all rush over.

73
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:14,972
Why did you do that?

74
00:07:17,179 --> 00:07:18,738
To be fussed over.

75
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,013
Come with me.

76
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,810
I like music, but the classes were
so dull.

77
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,371
This was a prize for arithmetic...

78
00:07:37,859 --> 00:07:39,657
and this one for reading.

79
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:42,212
This one too.

80
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,210
My poor mother was so proud of
me with my laurels.

81
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,856
On the first Friday of the month...

82
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,257
I pick flowers from the garden for
her grave.

83
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:12,856
I'd like to live in town.

84
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,573
At least in winter.

85
00:08:15,739 --> 00:08:19,015
There again, summer days are so
long, they're even duller.

86
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,654
Don't you think?

87
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,813
Maitre Rouault!

88
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,928
M. Bovary!

89
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:32,248
Maitre Rouault!

90
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,015
I've something to say to you.

91
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,735
Tell me then... Perhaps I already
know what it is.

92
00:08:40,939 --> 00:08:41,816
M. Rouault...

93
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,015
There's nothing I'd like better...

94
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:57,336
and I expect the lass agrees...

95
00:08:57,539 --> 00:08:59,496
but we must ask her opinion.

96
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,015
Now, this is what we'll do:

97
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,574
I'll go home but don't bother
coming.

98
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:07,054
All the workers are there for
supper.

99
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,611
It would be a shock for her.

100
00:09:09,819 --> 00:09:13,096
But so as you won't fret, if it's
yes...

101
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:16,451
I'll push the shutter back against
the wall.

102
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:19,332
You can see it from behind the
barn.

103
00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:09,295
Are you happy?

104
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,856
Yes. But I'd have liked a midnight
wedding, by torch-light.

105
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,328
It's a fine day.

106
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:16,688
That it is!

107
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,650
Charles, you have to cut it.

108
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:06,812
Go on, Charles, cut it.

109
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,496
Cut it, cut it!

110
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,577
I'm counting on you, dear...

111
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:17,054
to make my Charles happy at last.

112
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:18,973
He's so deserving.

113
00:11:38,939 --> 00:11:41,010
I'll put the trap away. Wait here.

114
00:11:57,179 --> 00:11:59,774
Nastasie, this is Madame.

115
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,775
Emma, this is Nastasie, the
housekeeper.

116
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,934
I haven't cooked.

117
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,607
That was wise. We aren't hungry.

118
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,015
You can go to bed, Nastasie.

119
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:20,014
Do you want to see my surgery?

120
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,491
I'll see it tomorrow.

121
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:27,453
I want to go to bed.

122
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,489
Nastasie!

123
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:53,454
Madame's hungry and so am I. What
can we have?

124
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:54,615
I've made soup.

125
00:12:54,819 --> 00:12:56,775
Good but we need a choice.

126
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,255
Some chocolate or tea.

127
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,093
We haven't any.

128
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:02,972
Emma!

129
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:07,894
What do you want to eat? What
would you really like?

130
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,250
I don't know, I don't mind.

131
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,656
Some soup?

132
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:18,934
Yes, soup. That's fine.

133
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:19,528
You're later every day.

134
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,299
Yes, I know. But it's a good sign.

135
00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:24,371
I've more and more patients.

136
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,299
You must be tired.

137
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,338
A little, yes.

138
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,935
Come and eat. I've made some
gruel.

139
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,208
Where's Nastasie?

140
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:34,890
It was late. I sent her to bed.

141
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,332
I don't want to keep her.

142
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,730
She's too old.

143
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,531
As their life together became
more intimate...

144
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:49,813
a growing detachment distanced
her from him.

145
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:53,809
Charles'conversation was as flat
as a pavement.

146
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,975
It's going to rain.

147
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:58,092
His borrowed ideas trudged past
in colourless procession...

148
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:01,097
without emotion, laughter or
dreams.

149
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:02,619
Well, I think so.

150
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,895
O God, why did I get married?

151
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:42,495
Home already?

152
00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:45,692
I still have two patients to see.
I've come...

153
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,333
I sent your bills to M. Pommier
and Mme Loubet.

154
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:49,654
That's good.

155
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,895
Remember the Marquis
d'Andervilliers?

156
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:55,178
The abscess in his mouth...

157
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,411
He asked us for some cherry-tree
cuttings.

158
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:00,650
I never saw him.

159
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,049
No, but you will see him.

160
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,334
Just think, he's invited us to his
ball.

161
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,457
Us?

162
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:12,457
Yes. To his grand ball!

163
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,970
It is true? Is it really true?

164
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:17,489
Yes, honestly. In two weeks time.

165
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,896
Charles! Tell me, will I have a
pretty dress?

166
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,327
Of course.

167
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,977
Monsieur and Madame Bovary.

168
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,932
Don't rumple my dress.

169
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:52,978
Are you happy?

170
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,971
My shoes will be awkward for
dancing.

171
00:16:56,179 --> 00:16:59,456
Dancing? They'd laugh at you! A
doctor doesn't dance!

172
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,578
Look! Champagne!

173
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,530
I'll get some.

174
00:17:06,739 --> 00:17:07,615
That's kind.

175
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,657
- Castellane.
- Bovary.

176
00:17:52,699 --> 00:17:54,292
Oh! Just right!

177
00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:57,776
You danced well. You were very
graceful.

178
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,133
There are even more mysterious
sights:

179
00:18:01,499 --> 00:18:05,048
Vesuvius at dawn, the rose
gardens of Genoa...

180
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:06,773
the Coliseum by moonlight.

181
00:18:07,499 --> 00:18:09,775
Moonlight's beautiful everywhere.

182
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:13,374
You're radiant, dear Berthe.

183
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,418
Romulus and Miss Arabelle were
two lengths ahead.

184
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:24,009
I jumped the ditch. That's how to
win 2,000 pounds in England.

185
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:27,735
You're luckier than I. My horses
are running to fat.

186
00:18:36,979 --> 00:18:40,688
Could you pick my fan up from
behind the sofa, sir?

187
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,254
Maxime, for pity's sake, it's too
hot.

188
00:18:50,459 --> 00:18:52,530
Your wish is my command, my
dear.

189
00:18:52,739 --> 00:18:53,171
Lucien!

190
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,372
Madame, may I?

191
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,253
Oh, but I'm hardly familiar with
the waltz.

192
00:19:09,459 --> 00:19:12,293
I'll lead. You'll manage very well.

193
00:21:25,459 --> 00:21:26,290
You, Vicomte!

194
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,416
She certainly knows how to waltz!

195
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,130
She probably has lots of practice.

196
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,291
We're among the last to leave.

197
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,092
Did you have fun?

198
00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:34,650
It's the most beautiful day of my
life.

199
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:49,096
What is it?

200
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,769
I'm taking my boots off. My feet
are killing me.

201
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,690
The most beautiful day of my life.

202
00:23:03,699 --> 00:23:07,487
The doctor from Yvetot didn't
agree...

203
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,248
With the treatment I gave old
Bouret.

204
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:13,295
The family looked pretty grim.

205
00:23:14,699 --> 00:23:16,292
What did you answer?

206
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,416
Nothing.

207
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,813
What could I answer?

208
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,615
What?

209
00:23:23,979 --> 00:23:26,015
You were humiliated by a man...

210
00:23:26,219 --> 00:23:27,733
Who isn't your equal?

211
00:23:28,499 --> 00:23:31,492
He didn't share my opinion nor I
his.

212
00:23:31,699 --> 00:23:35,136
How dare he judge you! It's
shameful!

213
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,371
It doesn't matter.

214
00:23:38,219 --> 00:23:39,538
Don't get so upset.

215
00:23:39,739 --> 00:23:41,536
No, I won't stand for it!

216
00:23:46,499 --> 00:23:48,695
What a pitiful man!

217
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:55,649
Secretly, she was waiting for
something.

218
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,533
Every day, on awakening, she
expected it.

219
00:23:58,739 --> 00:24:01,776
She listened to every sound,
surprised when nothing came.

220
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,494
Then, at sunset, ever sadder...

221
00:24:04,699 --> 00:24:06,576
she longed for the next day.

222
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,412
At that time, she hoped...

223
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,214
that the Marquis would give
another ball.

224
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:15,571
But September went by without a
letter or a visit.

225
00:24:20,939 --> 00:24:22,339
She gave up music...

226
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,736
left her drawings and needlework
in the cupboard.

227
00:24:25,939 --> 00:24:27,611
Sewing annoyed her.

228
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,775
"I've read everything," she'd say.

229
00:24:29,979 --> 00:24:32,255
She sat holding the tongues in
the fire...

230
00:24:32,459 --> 00:24:34,256
or watching the rain fall.

231
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,092
Charles had noticed his wife's
languor.

232
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,813
For a while, he didn't know what
to do...

233
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:45,374
then he made a secret decision...

234
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:49,175
hoping that what for him was a
great sacrifice...

235
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,213
would allow Emma's health to
improve.

236
00:24:53,179 --> 00:24:55,932
Would you be sad...

237
00:24:57,019 --> 00:24:58,691
to leave Tostes?

238
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,131
Why do you ask?

239
00:25:02,499 --> 00:25:04,535
Because if you agree...

240
00:25:04,739 --> 00:25:08,334
I've decided to open a practice in a
bigger town.

241
00:25:14,979 --> 00:25:15,810
In Rouen?

242
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:19,170
No, not Rouen. Rouen's out of the
question.

243
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:24,015
In Yonville. It's almost a town.

244
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,608
It's at least four times bigger
than this place.

245
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,613
Are you sure?

246
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:32,738
If you want to, yes.

247
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,096
We'll start a new life.

248
00:25:41,459 --> 00:25:44,293
I'll have to find new customers.

249
00:25:45,259 --> 00:25:47,012
It'll be easy, I'm sure.

250
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,254
You're a good doctor, everybody
knows that.

251
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,538
Let's not take
Nastasie.

252
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,413
Careful, Felicite.

253
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,291
Yes.

254
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,530
Yes, ma'am.

255
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:12,817
My wedding bouquet.

256
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:14,453
- It was pretty.
- Yes.

257
00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:24,737
Are you burning it, ma'am?

258
00:26:25,739 --> 00:26:26,296
We're off...

259
00:26:26,499 --> 00:26:27,409
to a new life.

260
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:31,454
When they left Tostes in March,
Madame Bovary was pregnant.

261
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,136
Be quiet, M. Homais, you pagan!

262
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,249
You've no religion!

263
00:26:35,459 --> 00:26:37,178
One can worship God in a field...

264
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,256
or by gazing at the stars.

265
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,418
The Hirondelle's late.

266
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:45,533
My God is the God of Socrates,
Franklin, Beranger...

267
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,735
and Voltaire!

268
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,573
I can't believe in some old God in
his garden...

269
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,930
a stick in his hand, putting up his
friends in whales...

270
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:56,256
Who dies with a croak and revives
three days later.

271
00:26:56,459 --> 00:26:57,415
It's quite absurd...

272
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,293
and opposed to all physical laws.

273
00:27:00,499 --> 00:27:01,614
It indicates...

274
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,458
that priests live in total
ignorance...

275
00:27:04,659 --> 00:27:07,298
and strive to drag people down
with them.

276
00:27:07,499 --> 00:27:08,330
Here it is!

277
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:11,419
The Hirondelle!

278
00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:26,809
Did you see Bourriches?

279
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:27,929
Is mother better?

280
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:28,855
You're late.

281
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,618
A passenger felt ill.

282
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,930
Forgive me for costing you
precious minutes.

283
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,578
Don't worry, madame. Let me
welcome you...

284
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,451
to our town. Good-bye for now.

285
00:27:47,659 --> 00:27:48,853
Good-day, M. Homais.

286
00:27:49,659 --> 00:27:52,857
M. Bovary, madame, I'm your
chemist, M. Homais.

287
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,937
I hope you had a good journey.

288
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,859
I'm pleased to welcome you to
Yonville.

289
00:27:58,499 --> 00:27:59,295
Hippolyte!

290
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,569
Take in M. and Mme Bovary's bags.

291
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:07,169
You must be tired.

292
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:11,008
Our Hirondelle tosses you around
terribly.

293
00:28:11,219 --> 00:28:14,417
That's true, but I like being shaken
up.

294
00:28:15,019 --> 00:28:16,453
I like to move about.

295
00:28:16,659 --> 00:28:19,572
It's so gloomy to be stuck in one
place.

296
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,655
M. and Mme Bovary, this is Leon
Dupuis...

297
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,498
clerk to our notary, Maitre
Guillaumin.

298
00:28:25,699 --> 00:28:29,009
This is M. Bovary, our new doctor,
and his wife.

299
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:32,650
If you were like me, always on
horseback...

300
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:36,694
Medical practice isn't too hard in
these parts.

301
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:38,372
They pay pretty well.

302
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,578
Medically speaking, apart from
cases...

303
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,418
of bronchitis, enteritis, etc...

304
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,894
We have fevers at harvest time...

305
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,817
and, of course, scrofula...

306
00:28:48,019 --> 00:28:51,137
due to the peasants' deplorable
conditions.

307
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,217
You'll have to fight superstition...

308
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:56,171
a lot of stubbornness...

309
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,939
They often resort...

310
00:28:59,179 --> 00:29:01,136
to prayer, religion and the priest...

311
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,218
rather than coming to see the
doctor or the chemist.

312
00:29:06,499 --> 00:29:08,535
The climate is temperate here.

313
00:29:08,739 --> 00:29:12,698
We're sheltered from the north
wind by the Argueil Forest...

314
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,255
and from the west by St. Jean's
Hill.

315
00:29:15,459 --> 00:29:17,256
However, this heat...

316
00:29:17,459 --> 00:29:20,213
given off by the river's vapour...

317
00:29:20,419 --> 00:29:24,048
and the herds of cattle...

318
00:29:24,259 --> 00:29:25,851
which exhale ammoniac...

319
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,255
nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen...

320
00:29:28,459 --> 00:29:30,131
Are there any walks here?

321
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:31,535
Very few.

322
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,932
There's the pasture...

323
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,890
up the hill at the edge of the
woods.

324
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,331
I sometimes take a book up there
at sunset.

325
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,255
Nothing's more wonderful than a
sunset.

326
00:29:44,459 --> 00:29:46,098
Especially at the sea-side.

327
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:48,690
I love the sea!

328
00:29:49,699 --> 00:29:52,578
Doesn't that expanse uplift your
soul?

329
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,699
Mountainscapes can be like that.

330
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,412
In Switzerland, for example...

331
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,335
And music?

332
00:29:58,739 --> 00:30:00,617
I don't play but I like it a lot.

333
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:03,573
Don't listen to him, he's too
modest.

334
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,453
I've heard him singing in his room.

335
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:08,968
Leon lives just above my shop.

336
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:12,889
You were singing The Guardian
Angel like a professional.

337
00:30:13,939 --> 00:30:15,293
What music do you like?

338
00:30:15,739 --> 00:30:16,331
German.

339
00:30:17,219 --> 00:30:18,538
It sets you dreaming.

340
00:30:19,219 --> 00:30:22,017
Your house is one of the best here.

341
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,929
The advantage for a doctor...

342
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:28,688
is a rear door, so people can come
and go without being seen.

343
00:30:29,259 --> 00:30:31,409
There's an arbour in the garden.

344
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,531
If madame likes gardening...

345
00:30:34,739 --> 00:30:36,890
my wife isn't interested.

346
00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:40,534
She much prefers reading in her
room.

347
00:30:40,979 --> 00:30:42,129
I'm the same.

348
00:30:42,499 --> 00:30:45,492
Reading by the fire, while a storm
rages...

349
00:30:45,699 --> 00:30:46,688
isn't it lovely?

350
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:49,095
You forget, the hours pass...

351
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,335
you live with the characters.

352
00:30:51,939 --> 00:30:52,975
You're right.

353
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:56,850
Have you ever found in a book...

354
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,369
the expression of your ideas...

355
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:03,458
and even the exact description of
your inner thoughts?

356
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,453
I have felt that.

357
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,656
It's my only distraction here.

358
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,015
Yonville has so few attractions.

359
00:31:11,459 --> 00:31:13,178
It can't be worse than Tostes.

360
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,210
I belonged to a library there.

361
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:19,254
If you'll do me the honour, my
library is at your disposal.

362
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:23,334
I have Voltaire, Rousseau and
Walter Scott...

363
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,211
and every day The Rouen Beacon...

364
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:28,139
of which I am the local
correspondent.

365
00:31:28,699 --> 00:31:32,136
If you'll excuse us, we shall
retire.

366
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,012
I talk and talk...

367
00:31:34,219 --> 00:31:36,495
Mme Bovary must be exhausted.

368
00:31:36,699 --> 00:31:38,531
Goodnight, madame, doctor.

369
00:31:38,739 --> 00:31:40,855
A night in a strange place... How
exciting.

370
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,048
Goodnight.

371
00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:13,614
Monsieur Homais!

372
00:32:16,459 --> 00:32:16,971
It's over!

373
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,975
It's a girl.

374
00:32:30,939 --> 00:32:34,534
During her convalescence, she
wondered about names.

375
00:32:34,739 --> 00:32:37,698
She hesitated between Clara,
Amanda or Yseult.

376
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,208
Charles wanted her named for his
mother.

377
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:41,819
Emma was against this.

378
00:32:42,019 --> 00:32:43,419
At last, she chose Berthe...

379
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,418
a name she had heard at the ball.

380
00:32:47,179 --> 00:32:50,296
The baby was nursed by the
carpenter's wife.

381
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,936
One day, Emma felt a sudden need
to see her.

382
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:59,611
She set off for the nurse's abode
at the far end of the village.

383
00:33:13,739 --> 00:33:15,571
- Good day, madame.
- M. Dupuis!

384
00:33:16,699 --> 00:33:20,454
I'm going to see my baby but I feel
a little tired.

385
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:25,009
Are you busy? If not, you could
accompany me.

386
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,775
By nightfall, all Yonville knew.

387
00:33:31,979 --> 00:33:33,857
Madame Tuvache, the mayor's
wife...

388
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:34,969
declared that...

389
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,977
Madame Bovary was
compromising herself.

390
00:33:50,739 --> 00:33:53,493
Come on in. Your little one's
sleeping.

391
00:34:23,459 --> 00:34:24,608
She's been sick.

392
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,092
I have to keep washing her.

393
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:31,209
Could you ask the grocer to let me
have soap when I need it?

394
00:34:31,419 --> 00:34:32,535
I'll do that.

395
00:34:34,459 --> 00:34:36,371
It's hard getting up at night.

396
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:38,650
I fall asleep in my chair.

397
00:34:40,459 --> 00:34:43,930
A pound of coffee would last me a
month.

398
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:45,255
Forgive my insisting...

399
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:48,213
but my poor husband needs some
brandy.

400
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,378
I'll rub the baby's tender little
feet with it.

401
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,693
Some Spanish dancers, I forget
their name...

402
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,934
are coming to Rouen.

403
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:57,015
Will you go?

404
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,175
If I can.

405
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:03,050
Thank you for your company.

406
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,648
It was a pleasure, a real pleasure.

407
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,256
I'm so bored!

408
00:35:18,139 --> 00:35:19,095
I'm so bored!

409
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,776
When Leon went to the Lion d'Or
to dine...

410
00:35:24,139 --> 00:35:26,972
Mme Bovary trembled on seeing him...

411
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:28,017
and ordered...

412
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,289
dinner to be served.

413
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,095
Evening all!

414
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,097
M. Homais arrived during dinner.

415
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,336
He'd sit down between them...

416
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:37,336
and ask about the patients...

417
00:35:37,539 --> 00:35:41,168
while the doctor inquired about
their resources.

418
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,097
Then they discussed the news...

419
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,097
which Homais knew by heart from the
paper.

420
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,735
At eight, Justin came for him to shut
up shop.

421
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,247
I think my lad's in love with your maid.

422
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,736
On Sundays, the chemist was host...

423
00:35:56,939 --> 00:36:00,693
with Mme Homais and the children,
Napoleon and Athalie.

424
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,535
Leon never missed a Sunday gathering.

425
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,889
M. Homais played ecarte with Emma.

426
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:08,488
Leon stood behind her, giving advice.

427
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:15,611
Then the apothecary and the doctor
played dominoes.

428
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,892
Mme Bovary changed places; Leon sat
beside her.

429
00:36:19,099 --> 00:36:20,818
She'd ask him to read poetry.

430
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:23,135
Leon recited in a slow voice...

431
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:26,650
which he carefully lowered in the love
passages.

432
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,168
"O, Time, suspend thy flight

433
00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:32,010
"And you, auspicious hours

434
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,092
"Suspend your movement

435
00:36:34,499 --> 00:36:36,092
"Let us savour

436
00:36:36,499 --> 00:36:40,287
"The fast-fading delights of these
oh so happy days. "

437
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,894
He's charming! Charming!

438
00:36:47,059 --> 00:36:48,936
He's surely in love!

439
00:36:49,539 --> 00:36:50,575
But with whom?

440
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,573
Who can it be?

441
00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:01,409
It's me!

442
00:37:05,019 --> 00:37:06,738
If only Heaven had desired it!

443
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:10,492
Why isn't it so?

444
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:13,372
Who's to blame?

445
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:18,055
What is it?

446
00:37:18,419 --> 00:37:20,251
M. Lheureux to see you.

447
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:23,653
M. Lheureux, the draper? What
does he want?

448
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,650
Madame, forgive me disturbing you
at home.

449
00:37:30,939 --> 00:37:34,057
But I'm most distraught at not
having obtained...

450
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,251
your patronage as yet.

451
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,974
My modest shop can't attract...

452
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,171
a true lady of fashion.

453
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:45,488
I'd like you to know that you only
have to order...

454
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,088
and I'll supply all your needs...

455
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:52,249
in haberdashery, hosiery,
millinery and fancy goods.

456
00:37:52,459 --> 00:37:54,894
I go to Rouen four times a month...

457
00:37:55,099 --> 00:37:57,852
and I work with only the best
firms.

458
00:37:58,059 --> 00:37:59,539
If you'll allow me...

459
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:02,173
I'd like to show you some
articles...

460
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,735
that are quite remarkable.

461
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:09,767
I don't need anything.

462
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:13,418
Just for the pleasure of looking.

463
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,528
How much is it?

464
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,289
A trifle, a mere trifle.

465
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:22,695
There's no hurry. Whenever you
like.

466
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,856
We're not Jews!

467
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:31,610
No, thank you, M. Lheureux.

468
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,771
I require nothing.

469
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,773
Well, we'll reach an understanding
later.

470
00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:39,898
I've always got on well with the
ladies.

471
00:38:40,139 --> 00:38:42,858
I mean, money doesn't worry me.

472
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:45,050
I'll even give you some if need be.

473
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,610
I wouldn't have to look far to find
it.

474
00:38:55,019 --> 00:38:57,329
M. Bovary must have many
patients...

475
00:38:57,539 --> 00:38:59,450
in this changeable weather.

476
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,934
I feel out of sorts myself.

477
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:03,697
I'll have to call on him...

478
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,289
about a pain I get in my back.

479
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,298
Well, good-bye, Madame Bovary.

480
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:13,050
As ever, your very humble servant.

481
00:39:18,139 --> 00:39:19,414
Good-bye, M. Lheureux.

482
00:39:29,019 --> 00:39:30,577
How good I've been.

483
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,852
Ma'am, it's Leon Dupuis.

484
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,336
Come in, M. Dupuis.

485
00:39:45,459 --> 00:39:47,496
I have to go to Rouen on business.

486
00:39:48,539 --> 00:39:50,336
Your subscription is up.

487
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,809
Should I renew it?

488
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,211
Why?

489
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,537
Because...

490
00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:00,930
you're giving it up?

491
00:40:01,539 --> 00:40:03,450
What? Music? Good Lord, yes!

492
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,490
I have a house, a husband...

493
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,974
I have much more important
duties.

494
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,215
Charles is so kind.

495
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,535
That he is.

496
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,977
M. Homais sings his praises.

497
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,135
He's a good man.

498
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,251
Indeed.

499
00:40:17,019 --> 00:40:18,247
I've decided...

500
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,814
to take back Berthe and look after
her.

501
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:24,608
During visits...

502
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:28,528
Madame Bovary undressed the child to
show her limbs.

503
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,537
She'd say she adored children.

504
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,207
They were her comfort, joy and
weakness...

505
00:40:33,419 --> 00:40:36,253
and she'd give herself over to poetic
outbursts.

506
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,412
Show your feet to M. Homais.

507
00:40:38,979 --> 00:40:39,968
On Charles'return...

508
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,171
he found his slippers warming by
the fire.

509
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:47,055
His waistcoats were lined and
his buttons sewed back on.

510
00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:51,249
She no longer resisted strolling
in the garden.

511
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:03,497
His suggestions were always
accepted...

512
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,655
and if she didn't guess his
wishes...

513
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:09,010
she submitted to them without a
murmur.

514
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,577
Why not tell the master?

515
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,936
It's just nerves. It would only
worry him.

516
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:29,490
It's like old Guerin's daughter
before I came to you.

517
00:41:30,019 --> 00:41:33,137
She was so gloomy that if ever
you saw her...

518
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:36,537
you thought of a funeral shift in a
doorway.

519
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,655
They said she had a fog in her
mind...

520
00:41:40,459 --> 00:41:42,974
that doctors and priests couldn't
help her.

521
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:46,135
Once she married, it went away.

522
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:51,213
With me, it came on after I
married.

523
00:41:55,059 --> 00:41:57,698
Rascals! Always the same! Get
inside!

524
00:41:58,019 --> 00:42:00,135
Hurry up! You too!

525
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,970
They've no respect!

526
00:42:05,139 --> 00:42:06,334
How are you?

527
00:42:06,539 --> 00:42:07,972
Not well. I'm suffering.

528
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,776
So am I! It's the weather.

529
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,655
Still, we're born to suffer, as St.
Paul says.

530
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,858
What does M. Bovary think?

531
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,769
I don't need earthly remedies.

532
00:42:20,459 --> 00:42:22,894
Just you wait, Ribaudet, you
rascal!

533
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,253
I'd like to know...

534
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:28,010
That's Ribaudet, the carpenter's
son.

535
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,892
He's the ring-leader.

536
00:42:30,099 --> 00:42:31,613
How's M. Bovary?

537
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,811
He and I must be...

538
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:36,852
the busiest people in the parish.

539
00:42:37,059 --> 00:42:39,334
He tends to the body...

540
00:42:39,539 --> 00:42:41,211
while I tend to the soul.

541
00:42:41,419 --> 00:42:42,898
You relieve suffering.

542
00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:45,374
You can say that! This morning...

543
00:42:45,579 --> 00:42:48,332
I had to go and see a swollen cow.

544
00:42:48,539 --> 00:42:50,131
They said it was cursed.

545
00:42:55,499 --> 00:42:59,412
Will you stop that! You should be
ashamed!

546
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:07,093
As I was saying, farmers have a
hard life.

547
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,209
Others do too!

548
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,456
Oh, indeed! workers in the towns,
for example.

549
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:13,376
But women...

550
00:43:13,579 --> 00:43:15,137
Ah, that's true!

551
00:43:15,579 --> 00:43:17,570
I've known of mothers...

552
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:21,010
honest women, I assure you...

553
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,892
real saints...

554
00:43:23,539 --> 00:43:25,336
who didn't even have bread.

555
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:29,369
But what of those, Father...

556
00:43:30,139 --> 00:43:32,095
who have bread but no...

557
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,858
No fire in winter?

558
00:43:35,019 --> 00:43:35,577
What does it matter?

559
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,053
What do you mean?

560
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:40,650
When one has warmth and food,
things...

561
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,530
Oh, my God!

562
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,334
What's wrong? Digestive trouble.

563
00:43:46,539 --> 00:43:49,532
Go home, Mme Bovary, and have a
nice cup of tea.

564
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,535
No, no, it's...

565
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:53,173
I thought you were having a dizzy
spell.

566
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,133
You asked me something. What
was it?

567
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,092
I can't remember now...

568
00:44:04,499 --> 00:44:05,090
Nothing.

569
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:09,490
Nothing.

570
00:44:10,419 --> 00:44:12,296
You'll excuse me, Mme Bovary.

571
00:44:12,499 --> 00:44:14,809
I have to deal with these urchins.

572
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:18,729
Poor things! It's hard showing
them the ways of the Lord...

573
00:44:18,939 --> 00:44:22,852
as His Holy Son told us to do.

574
00:44:25,419 --> 00:44:28,253
Take care, and my respects to
your husband.

575
00:44:32,459 --> 00:44:33,528
Are you Christian?

576
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:36,128
Yes, I'm Christian.

577
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,738
What is a Christian?

578
00:44:37,939 --> 00:44:40,454
He who is born baptised.

579
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:50,454
Mama...

580
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:02,499
Oh, leave me be!

581
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:06,012
Leave me alone!

582
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,535
It's strange how ugly she is.

583
00:45:12,059 --> 00:45:13,048
Will you stop it?

584
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:17,488
I'm going mad!

585
00:45:18,619 --> 00:45:21,088
I'm going mad! You poor dear!

586
00:45:22,139 --> 00:45:23,619
Evening all!

587
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,613
Princess, what happened?

588
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:27,889
It's nothing.

589
00:45:28,499 --> 00:45:30,251
She had a little fall.

590
00:45:30,459 --> 00:45:33,418
Poor Emma was frantic with
worry.

591
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,695
I've some important news for you.

592
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,651
First, we stand a fair chance...

593
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:41,293
of having the Agricultural Show
here.

594
00:45:41,499 --> 00:45:42,137
Really?

595
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:45,729
Yes, just think. The Prefect, all
the local authorities!

596
00:45:45,939 --> 00:45:48,613
That will put us on the map.

597
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:51,050
That is important news.

598
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:52,693
And second?

599
00:45:52,939 --> 00:45:55,738
It's a surprise. I'm losing my
tenant.

600
00:45:55,939 --> 00:45:58,329
Leon is leaving for Paris next
week.

601
00:45:58,539 --> 00:46:01,178
Heavens! Has he thought about it?

602
00:46:01,499 --> 00:46:03,854
How will he live in Paris?

603
00:46:04,579 --> 00:46:05,490
Will he get used to it?

604
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:09,454
Good Lord! Masked balls, dinner
parties, champagne!

605
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,570
He'll be in his element!

606
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:14,340
They have fun in the Latin Quarter!

607
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:16,575
If they've any social graces...

608
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,930
they move in the best circles.

609
00:46:19,139 --> 00:46:22,097
Some grand ladies even fall in
love with them.

610
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,336
Afterwards, that enables them...

611
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:26,735
to make an excellent match.

612
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,648
I'll change plates. We've a tart.

613
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,976
Will you have some, M. Homais?

614
00:46:44,419 --> 00:46:46,217
- It's me again.
- I knew it.

615
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:47,934
Is M. Bovary here?

616
00:46:49,059 --> 00:46:50,697
No, he's out.

617
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,048
He's out.

618
00:46:54,419 --> 00:46:56,057
I'd like to kiss Berthe.

619
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,048
Yes, of course.

620
00:47:01,139 --> 00:47:02,175
Felicite!

621
00:47:02,979 --> 00:47:04,378
Fetch Berthe for me!

622
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,213
Farewell, poor child!

623
00:47:18,939 --> 00:47:21,010
Farewell, dear little one!

624
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,168
Take her.

625
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,093
It's going to rain.

626
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:42,488
I have my coat.

627
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:46,735
Good-bye, then.

628
00:47:47,979 --> 00:47:49,298
Yes, good-bye... Go.

629
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:57,093
English style, then!

630
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:04,613
She now considered herself even
unhappier...

631
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:06,412
as she began to feel certain...

632
00:48:07,059 --> 00:48:09,733
that her sorrow would never
end.

633
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:49,452
Could I see the doctor? I'm M.
Rodolphe Boulanger.

634
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:51,329
I'll fetch him.

635
00:48:58,380 --> 00:48:59,938
Thank you for seeing us.

636
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:03,372
My valet needs bleeding, he has
pins and needles.

637
00:49:03,579 --> 00:49:04,695
It'll purge me.

638
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,856
Good, let's do it.

639
00:49:07,059 --> 00:49:09,938
Justin, get some bandages from
the drawer...

640
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:12,416
and bring the basin over.

641
00:49:21,499 --> 00:49:22,932
Don't be afraid, my friend.

642
00:49:23,139 --> 00:49:24,619
No, no, go ahead.

643
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:37,008
Look. It's like a little spring.

644
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:40,097
What red blood! Is that a good
sign?

645
00:49:41,059 --> 00:49:43,573
Sometimes, they feel nothing at
first...

646
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:46,499
and then they faint.

647
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:49,968
I knew it.

648
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,133
Good Lord! Both of them!

649
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:53,613
Emma! Vinegar!

650
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:54,490
Hurry!

651
00:50:02,019 --> 00:50:02,896
Hide the basin.

652
00:50:06,059 --> 00:50:06,936
Sugar water.

653
00:50:07,499 --> 00:50:10,457
You silly fool! A big lad like you!

654
00:50:11,499 --> 00:50:13,889
You'll make a fine chemist!

655
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,773
Who asked you here? You're in the
way!

656
00:50:16,979 --> 00:50:19,494
You know I need you on
wednesdays!

657
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,530
We've 20 customers in the shop!

658
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,816
I had to leave them to come and
get you.

659
00:50:24,019 --> 00:50:26,135
Hurry up. Go and watch the jars!

660
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:28,048
Move out of the way.

661
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:33,456
Remarkable, a woman among these
fainting men!

662
00:50:34,539 --> 00:50:37,133
Other people's blood doesn't affect
me.

663
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:40,650
But the idea of seeing my own
would make me faint...

664
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:42,976
if I thought about it.

665
00:50:43,539 --> 00:50:46,930
You can stop worrying now you've
got what you wanted.

666
00:50:48,459 --> 00:50:51,178
In any case, it gave me the joy...

667
00:50:52,019 --> 00:50:53,532
of making your acquaintance.

668
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:58,769
Very nice, that doctor's wife.

669
00:50:59,499 --> 00:51:02,093
Pretty teeth, a dainty foot, fine
clothes...

670
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:04,889
Where did that oaf find her?

671
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:07,090
She's probably bored with him.

672
00:51:07,419 --> 00:51:09,650
While he's out, she mends his
socks!

673
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:13,135
She'd like to dance the polka in
town. Poor thing!

674
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:17,809
She's gasping for love like a fish
out of water.

675
00:51:19,059 --> 00:51:22,177
A few gallant words and she'll
adore you!

676
00:51:22,499 --> 00:51:24,615
How to get rid of her after?

677
00:51:25,019 --> 00:51:28,615
Madame Bovary, you're quite
pretty and fresh!

678
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:30,695
I'll have her!

679
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:35,816
I'll have her! The Show's soon!

680
00:51:36,019 --> 00:51:37,577
She'll be there.

681
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:41,097
The famous Show did indeed
arrive.

682
00:52:08,019 --> 00:52:09,338
Everyone was merry...

683
00:52:09,539 --> 00:52:13,374
but widow Lefrancois, talking
with M. Homais, looked...

684
00:52:13,579 --> 00:52:14,773
very gloomy.

685
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:16,653
There's Lheureux.

686
00:52:18,499 --> 00:52:20,570
He's selling the Cafe Francais.

687
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:24,055
He murdered old Tellier with his
bills.

688
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:25,977
what a terrible tragedy!

689
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:28,648
The cafe's sordid and I hate
Tellier...

690
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:32,048
but I don't like that wheedler
Lheureux.

691
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:34,932
Look, he's greeting Mme Bovary.

692
00:52:35,139 --> 00:52:36,778
- Where?
- In the market.

693
00:52:37,099 --> 00:52:39,169
I have a seat for her.

694
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:41,530
She's wearing a green hat.

695
00:52:42,099 --> 00:52:44,055
She's on M. Boulanger's arm.

696
00:52:44,499 --> 00:52:46,218
Quick, here's the apothecary!

697
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:51,376
A lovely day! Everyone's here! It's
an east wind!

698
00:52:51,579 --> 00:52:53,218
Good-bye, M. Lheureux.

699
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:57,130
How you got rid of him!

700
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,092
Why be bothered by others...

701
00:52:59,619 --> 00:53:01,769
as I'm here with you today?

702
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:05,619
Look at the daisies.

703
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:09,092
All those oracles for girls in love.

704
00:53:09,579 --> 00:53:11,251
Should I pick one?

705
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:13,452
Are you in love?

706
00:53:14,979 --> 00:53:15,570
Who knows?

707
00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:18,852
Are you abandoning us?

708
00:53:19,059 --> 00:53:21,289
Surely not. We'll be right back.

709
00:53:22,139 --> 00:53:25,416
He can forget that! I much prefer
your company!

710
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:33,137
Here's the Prefect!

711
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:37,617
The Prefect couldn't come.

712
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:40,209
That's his main adviser.

713
00:53:41,939 --> 00:53:43,736
Let's take a grandstand seat.

714
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:50,409
All this seems a great event for
them.

715
00:53:50,619 --> 00:53:52,211
Oh, provincial mediocrity!

716
00:53:52,419 --> 00:53:54,887
It stifles life and kills dreams.

717
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:58,416
You can see, dear lady, why I'm so
very sad.

718
00:53:58,619 --> 00:54:00,655
I thought you were happy!

719
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:02,698
Outwardly, I am.

720
00:54:03,459 --> 00:54:06,532
I must show a laughing face to the
world.

721
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:07,775
And your friends?

722
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:10,889
My friends?

723
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:12,889
What friends?

724
00:54:13,939 --> 00:54:15,338
Who cares about me?

725
00:54:16,539 --> 00:54:18,655
I miss so much by being alone.

726
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:21,579
If I had a goal in life, or
affection...

727
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:24,852
if I'd found someone, I'd have
overcome every obstacle.

728
00:54:26,419 --> 00:54:28,057
You've no cause to complain.

729
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:29,374
You think not?

730
00:54:30,579 --> 00:54:32,059
After all, you're free...

731
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:33,650
Rich.

732
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,258
Don't make fun of me.

733
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:41,407
That's not the Prefect!

734
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:44,289
It's Lieuvain, his right-hand man.

735
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:49,570
The decorations are very poor,
don't you think?

736
00:54:49,939 --> 00:54:52,374
Obviously, the mayor was in
charge.

737
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:55,215
He's no artistic genius.

738
00:54:56,139 --> 00:54:57,095
Gentlemen...

739
00:54:58,459 --> 00:55:00,575
first of all let me say...

740
00:55:01,459 --> 00:55:03,291
before talking...

741
00:55:03,499 --> 00:55:06,093
of the object of today's
gathering...

742
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:09,332
and I'm sure these feelings...

743
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:11,816
will be shared by you...

744
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,849
allow me then...

745
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:19,414
to pay tribute to the Public
Services...

746
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:21,934
the Government...

747
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:23,735
the Monarch...

748
00:55:24,019 --> 00:55:26,329
gentlemen, our Sovereign...

749
00:55:26,539 --> 00:55:27,655
I should stand back.

750
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:28,655
Why?

751
00:55:28,979 --> 00:55:30,173
I could be seen.

752
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:32,735
I'd have some explaining to do,
With my reputation...

753
00:55:32,939 --> 00:55:35,407
- You exaggerate!
- No, it really is appalling.

754
00:55:37,499 --> 00:55:39,490
From a certain point of view...

755
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,258
it's quite justified.

756
00:55:41,459 --> 00:55:42,336
How?

757
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:44,814
Don't you know of tormented
souls?

758
00:55:45,019 --> 00:55:48,898
They need dreams and action and
the purest of passion.

759
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:52,492
And so we throw ourselves into
fancies...

760
00:55:54,099 --> 00:55:55,135
and madness.

761
00:56:00,499 --> 00:56:03,731
We poor women don't have such
distractions.

762
00:56:03,939 --> 00:56:06,693
They're sad indeed, if they bring
no joy.

763
00:56:08,059 --> 00:56:09,856
Can it ever be found?

764
00:56:10,059 --> 00:56:10,970
Yes.

765
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:13,293
You find it one day.

766
00:56:14,459 --> 00:56:16,530
You find it when you thought it
lost.

767
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,331
Then new horizons open.

768
00:56:18,979 --> 00:56:21,778
You confide everything in the
other...

769
00:56:21,979 --> 00:56:23,537
sacrifice everything.

770
00:56:24,019 --> 00:56:26,329
There's no talk, just intuition.

771
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:28,856
It's the person you've dreamt of.

772
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:32,014
However, you don't dare believe it.

773
00:56:32,939 --> 00:56:35,499
You're dazzled as if coming from
shadows...

774
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:37,532
into the light.

775
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:42,738
Let's say it plainly...

776
00:56:42,939 --> 00:56:46,454
no place is more patriotic than
the countryside...

777
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:48,854
more devoted to the civil cause...

778
00:56:49,059 --> 00:56:50,651
in a word, more intelligent.

779
00:56:51,099 --> 00:56:53,329
I don't mean, gentlemen...

780
00:56:53,539 --> 00:56:55,894
that superficial intelligence...

781
00:56:56,099 --> 00:56:58,488
that vainly adorns the idle mind...

782
00:56:59,579 --> 00:57:03,334
but that deep and moderate
intelligence...

783
00:57:04,499 --> 00:57:07,537
that comes from respecting the
law and observing one's duty.

784
00:57:08,139 --> 00:57:10,175
Ah, time and again, duty!

785
00:57:10,419 --> 00:57:12,251
Those words stultify me.

786
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:16,414
Duty is to know what is great, and
cherish what is beautiful...

787
00:57:16,619 --> 00:57:18,133
and not to accept society's rules...

788
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:20,729
with their inherent ignominy.

789
00:57:21,499 --> 00:57:22,454
But...

790
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:26,293
Passion is the one good thing on
earth.

791
00:57:26,499 --> 00:57:28,615
It gives us heroism, enthusiasm...

792
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,334
music, poetry, art, everything!

793
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:37,293
But one must follow opinion and
its morality.

794
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,258
There are two moralities.

795
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:43,130
The petty, conventional one...

796
00:57:43,939 --> 00:57:45,497
ever-changing and loud-mouthed.

797
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:49,454
The other, the eternal one is
around us and above us...

798
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,972
like the landscape and the clear
blue sky.

799
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:55,055
Continue!

800
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:57,175
Persevere!

801
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:00,253
Doesn't this conspiracy of Society
disgust you?

802
00:58:00,579 --> 00:58:02,456
Doesn't it condemn every
emotion?

803
00:58:03,419 --> 00:58:06,729
Noble and pure feelings are
persecuted and insulted...

804
00:58:06,939 --> 00:58:10,090
and should two poor souls meet, it
keeps them apart.

805
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:14,133
But why worry as they will unite
in love one day...

806
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:17,615
because such is the destiny they
were born to.

807
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:19,289
The winner...

808
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,651
will lift up the loser...

809
00:58:22,419 --> 00:58:24,456
and live in brotherhood with him.

810
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,811
So why was it that we met?

811
00:58:27,019 --> 00:58:28,372
What chance caused it?

812
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:31,731
Over the distance, like two rivers
joining...

813
00:58:31,939 --> 00:58:34,169
our paths led us to each other.

814
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:37,499
Overall prize!

815
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:39,019
Monsieur Bizet!

816
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:42,934
I've never known anyone more
perfect to be with.

817
00:58:44,019 --> 00:58:46,613
Manure! Monsieur Caron!

818
00:58:47,139 --> 00:58:49,256
Thus, I'll carry away your memory.

819
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,133
You'll forget me.

820
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:53,619
I'll pass like a shadow.

821
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:55,412
Best merino ram!

822
00:58:56,059 --> 00:58:58,494
Shall I count for something in
your life...

823
00:58:58,700 --> 00:58:59,894
in your thoughts?

824
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,452
Best pigs! A shared prize...

825
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:09,456
You're kind to listen. You know I'm
yours.

826
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,019
You may have noticed...

827
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:42,369
the priest's absence.

828
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:46,528
The church probably has different
views on progress.

829
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:51,334
I'll just tell the fire brigade to be
on their guard.

830
00:59:52,979 --> 00:59:53,809
M. Boulanger!

831
00:59:54,499 --> 00:59:55,773
A fine day, wasn't it?

832
00:59:55,979 --> 00:59:57,128
A fine day indeed!

833
00:59:58,099 --> 01:00:00,488
Let me past to see the fire
brigade!

834
01:00:06,419 --> 01:00:09,378
Several weeks went by with no
sign of Rodolphe.

835
01:00:09,579 --> 01:00:12,218
He thought, "If she loves me
straight away...

836
01:00:12,419 --> 01:00:15,456
"she'll love me more if I keep her
waiting. "

837
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:17,809
He knew he'd been right...

838
01:00:18,019 --> 01:00:20,852
when he arrived and saw Emma
turn pale.

839
01:00:21,939 --> 01:00:25,296
Forgive me for not coming sooner.
I was busy.

840
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:26,369
I've been ill.

841
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:27,809
Nothing serious?

842
01:00:29,419 --> 01:00:30,409
Well...

843
01:00:32,579 --> 01:00:33,171
No.

844
01:00:36,059 --> 01:00:37,778
I didn't want to come back.

845
01:00:39,019 --> 01:00:39,849
Why?

846
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:45,573
Can't you guess?

847
01:00:48,619 --> 01:00:49,416
Emma...

848
01:00:50,499 --> 01:00:51,376
Monsieur!

849
01:00:52,939 --> 01:00:54,577
I've decided to go away...

850
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:56,409
far from you.

851
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:58,090
Very far.

852
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:00,809
So far you'll never hear of me.

853
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:04,771
Some irresistible force has
brought me here today.

854
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:07,251
An angel's smile is too strong.

855
01:01:08,619 --> 01:01:11,771
One is attracted by what is
beautiful, charming...

856
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:14,655
adorable...

857
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:18,255
I'm so pitiful.

858
01:01:19,579 --> 01:01:20,648
You're a good man!

859
01:01:22,419 --> 01:01:25,617
No, I love you, that's all. Didn't you
know?

860
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:27,814
Say it to me.

861
01:01:28,499 --> 01:01:29,898
One word, just one word!

862
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:42,454
Good day, doctor.

863
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:44,896
Delighted to see you, M. Boulanger.

864
01:01:45,099 --> 01:01:46,374
I came to see how madame is.

865
01:01:46,579 --> 01:01:48,889
Ah, I'm always afraid...

866
01:01:49,099 --> 01:01:50,738
the fits might come back.

867
01:01:50,939 --> 01:01:54,215
I was wondering if horse riding
might help.

868
01:01:55,139 --> 01:01:57,528
Indeed! Most excellent!

869
01:01:58,700 --> 01:01:59,610
Good idea!

870
01:02:00,099 --> 01:02:00,849
Emma...

871
01:02:03,499 --> 01:02:05,012
I don't have a horse.

872
01:02:05,419 --> 01:02:08,093
I can put one at your disposal.

873
01:02:10,539 --> 01:02:12,849
You're very kind, but... no.

874
01:02:13,979 --> 01:02:14,968
Thank you.

875
01:02:15,499 --> 01:02:19,175
I came to tell you that my man
still has dizzy spells.

876
01:02:20,099 --> 01:02:22,977
That's quite common. I'll call by.

877
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:25,898
I'll bring him. We won't trouble
you.

878
01:02:26,099 --> 01:02:28,409
Good, I'll be waiting.

879
01:02:28,939 --> 01:02:29,610
Madame...

880
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:43,294
Be careful, accidents happen. Your
horses might be skittish.

881
01:02:43,539 --> 01:02:45,052
No, don't worry.

882
01:02:47,579 --> 01:02:48,648
Enjoy your ride.

883
01:02:50,419 --> 01:02:52,057
Safety first, remember!

884
01:03:08,619 --> 01:03:10,497
Is our path now not the same?

885
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:12,849
No, you know it's impossible.

886
01:03:14,419 --> 01:03:15,613
Let's forget it.

887
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:18,494
Where are the horses? Where are
they?

888
01:03:19,019 --> 01:03:20,135
Where are the horses?

889
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:23,811
You scare me, you hurt me.

890
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:24,890
Let's leave.

891
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,099
I need you to live.

892
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:29,410
Your eyes, your voice, your
thoughts.

893
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:32,898
Oh, I'm wrong! I'm wrong! I must
be mad...

894
01:03:33,099 --> 01:03:34,055
to listen to you.

895
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:35,496
Why?

896
01:04:05,499 --> 01:04:06,090
What?

897
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:09,572
I saw M. Alexandre this afternoon.

898
01:04:10,019 --> 01:04:13,296
He has an old filly, still in good
shape...

899
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:17,249
which we could have for a hundred
ecus.

900
01:04:18,499 --> 01:04:20,809
I said we'd take it.

901
01:04:22,419 --> 01:04:23,613
I bought it.

902
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:28,097
Have I done right?

903
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:40,294
I have a lover!

904
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:44,329
I have a lover!

905
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:07,695
You, here!

906
01:06:14,019 --> 01:06:15,055
Your dress is wet!

907
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:17,296
I love you, I love you!

908
01:06:24,499 --> 01:06:25,773
It's time to go.

909
01:06:25,979 --> 01:06:27,697
I never want to leave you!

910
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,617
What's wrong? You're suffering?

911
01:06:33,979 --> 01:06:34,968
Speak to me.

912
01:06:37,579 --> 01:06:41,050
You shouldn't come here, you could
compromise yourself.

913
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:42,490
I don't care.

914
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:43,814
Don't be silly.

915
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:47,251
I want to see you. I think only of
you.

916
01:06:47,459 --> 01:06:50,019
Angel, I dream only of you. Don't
worry.

917
01:06:50,294 --> 01:06:51,362
I'll come to you.

918
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:12,290
Emma!

919
01:07:13,654 --> 01:07:16,168
Come to bed. It's late.

920
01:07:17,454 --> 01:07:18,523
I'm coming.

921
01:07:32,134 --> 01:07:35,125
Within six months, they treated
each other...

922
01:07:35,333 --> 01:07:37,165
like a couple trying to keep the
love alive...

923
01:07:37,373 --> 01:07:38,567
in their marriage.

924
01:07:39,094 --> 01:07:41,562
I want you! I want to devour you.

925
01:07:43,174 --> 01:07:45,641
That's when Emma repented.

926
01:07:54,294 --> 01:07:55,487
Bring her to me!

927
01:07:59,933 --> 01:08:02,687
I love you, my poor dear, I love
you!

928
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:05,723
Your ears are so dirty!

929
01:08:06,373 --> 01:08:08,444
My ears aren't dirty.

930
01:08:08,813 --> 01:08:11,373
She even wondered why she hated
Charles...

931
01:08:11,574 --> 01:08:13,929
and if she shouldn't love him.

932
01:08:14,134 --> 01:08:17,330
But he gave her no reason to do
so...

933
01:08:17,534 --> 01:08:20,765
until M. Homais provided him
with the ideal chance.

934
01:08:21,414 --> 01:08:23,768
Evening all! Look, Charles.

935
01:08:24,254 --> 01:08:27,723
They talk about a new method for
curing club feet.

936
01:08:27,933 --> 01:08:31,609
Tell me what you think. What if
you operated on Hippolyte?

937
01:08:32,254 --> 01:08:34,130
What glory for Yonville.

938
01:08:35,294 --> 01:08:38,013
Success is guaranteed, according
to the writer.

939
01:08:38,534 --> 01:08:40,285
And what fame for you.

940
01:08:40,654 --> 01:08:41,484
In my role...

941
01:08:41,694 --> 01:08:44,969
as the paper's correspondent, I'll
write an article.

942
01:08:45,173 --> 01:08:48,007
And articles get talked about. Who
knows?

943
01:08:48,853 --> 01:08:52,642
You're a skilful surgeon. I
remember father's leg.

944
01:08:53,574 --> 01:08:54,973
It's not the same thing.

945
01:08:55,173 --> 01:08:57,244
Don't be so modest, Charles.

946
01:08:57,454 --> 01:08:59,330
The family's honour is at stake.

947
01:09:00,013 --> 01:09:03,848
Charles started studying
strephocatopodia...

948
01:09:04,053 --> 01:09:07,569
strephendopodia,
strephexopodia...

949
01:09:07,774 --> 01:09:09,890
along with strephypopodia...

950
01:09:10,093 --> 01:09:12,129
and strephanopodia.

951
01:09:12,654 --> 01:09:14,848
A campaign led by M. Homais...

952
01:09:15,053 --> 01:09:18,012
tried to convince Hippolyte to
accept.

953
01:09:18,214 --> 01:09:20,932
Perhaps you'll feel a slight pain.

954
01:09:21,133 --> 01:09:23,694
It's just like being bled.

955
01:09:24,294 --> 01:09:27,808
It's nothing to do with me! It's for
you, out of humanity.

956
01:09:28,694 --> 01:09:32,084
To see you rid of that hideous
limp.

957
01:09:32,973 --> 01:09:35,932
Wouldn't you like to run like
anyone else?

958
01:09:36,133 --> 01:09:38,932
Women would like you better,
believe me.

959
01:09:40,454 --> 01:09:43,890
You're a man! Suppose you'd had to
fight for France?

960
01:09:56,013 --> 01:09:56,890
Are you all right?

961
01:09:57,774 --> 01:10:01,004
You'll see, it's nothing. He'll just
cut the tendon.

962
01:10:30,774 --> 01:10:31,285
There.

963
01:10:33,093 --> 01:10:34,209
I didn't feel a thing.

964
01:10:34,534 --> 01:10:35,852
See, I told you so.

965
01:10:37,334 --> 01:10:39,484
The operation is a success.

966
01:10:39,694 --> 01:10:41,365
A great day for our town!

967
01:10:42,093 --> 01:10:43,891
Our town...

968
01:10:44,294 --> 01:10:47,888
will always remember the name
of Dr Bovary.

969
01:11:06,454 --> 01:11:10,083
"Our small town of Yonville has
seen a surgical experiment...

970
01:11:10,294 --> 01:11:12,682
that is also a philanthropic act. "

971
01:11:13,933 --> 01:11:16,892
"M. Bovary, a distinguished
practitioner... "

972
01:11:17,093 --> 01:11:18,163
It's too much!

973
01:11:18,374 --> 01:11:19,887
No, not at all!

974
01:11:20,534 --> 01:11:23,923
"M. Bovary, a distinguished
practitioner...

975
01:11:24,133 --> 01:11:25,647
has cured the club foot... "

976
01:11:25,853 --> 01:11:28,651
I didn't use the scientific term...

977
01:11:28,853 --> 01:11:32,244
"of Hippolyte Toutain, ostler at
the Lion d'Or. "

978
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:35,571
"The operation went like magic...

979
01:11:35,774 --> 01:11:38,686
with only a few drops of blood on
the skin...

980
01:11:38,893 --> 01:11:40,725
to show that the rebel tendon...

981
01:11:40,933 --> 01:11:44,130
had at last yielded to the
surgeon's art. "

982
01:11:55,654 --> 01:11:58,326
Help, M. Bovary!

983
01:11:58,973 --> 01:12:00,043
Help!

984
01:12:01,013 --> 01:12:02,208
He's dying!

985
01:12:05,893 --> 01:12:08,566
M. Bovary! Quickly!

986
01:12:10,933 --> 01:12:12,048
He's dying!

987
01:12:13,494 --> 01:12:14,404
What is it?

988
01:12:17,374 --> 01:12:18,489
What's wrong?

989
01:12:28,574 --> 01:12:30,643
It hurts! God, it hurts!

990
01:12:37,173 --> 01:12:37,731
What's wrong?

991
01:12:46,093 --> 01:12:47,526
It's so swollen.

992
01:12:48,093 --> 01:12:50,767
It's nothing. It just needs some
air.

993
01:12:51,214 --> 01:12:52,852
When will I be better? Save me.

994
01:12:53,053 --> 01:12:56,444
Here, drink this. It will do you
good.

995
01:12:57,534 --> 01:12:59,445
Look at my dress. See the...

996
01:12:59,654 --> 01:13:01,053
Charles! How is he?

997
01:13:01,654 --> 01:13:04,248
Getting worse. I don't understand.

998
01:13:05,334 --> 01:13:06,084
Could you go?

999
01:13:06,614 --> 01:13:09,923
Of course, gladly. But I can't cure
him.

1000
01:13:11,893 --> 01:13:15,011
Stop thinking. Just get up and
walk.

1001
01:13:16,414 --> 01:13:18,165
In any case, you smell bad.

1002
01:13:21,933 --> 01:13:23,969
I've brought fresh bandages.

1003
01:13:25,053 --> 01:13:26,646
My husband's on his way.

1004
01:13:28,133 --> 01:13:29,328
Does it hurt?

1005
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:30,330
I lose.

1006
01:13:31,813 --> 01:13:33,008
Come for a drink?

1007
01:13:35,133 --> 01:13:36,772
You must be brave.

1008
01:13:37,454 --> 01:13:39,012
He really stinks.

1009
01:13:39,214 --> 01:13:41,169
I'm sure you'll be better soon.

1010
01:13:43,013 --> 01:13:46,051
Well, Hippolyte, I hear you're
suffering.

1011
01:13:47,454 --> 01:13:49,808
Good lad. You have to be brave.

1012
01:13:50,013 --> 01:13:52,244
This is a trial sent by the Lord.

1013
01:13:52,454 --> 01:13:55,651
Rejoice in your pain, as it is His
will...

1014
01:13:55,853 --> 01:13:58,846
and use it to make your peace
with Heaven.

1015
01:13:59,053 --> 01:14:02,569
There's black liquid and it's
swollen to the knee.

1016
01:14:02,774 --> 01:14:06,369
It can't go on. It's bad for
business.

1017
01:14:07,694 --> 01:14:08,808
Madame Bovary...

1018
01:14:09,694 --> 01:14:12,208
your husband must get another
doctor.

1019
01:14:12,973 --> 01:14:15,727
I'll send for M. Canivet, from
Neufchaftel.

1020
01:14:16,654 --> 01:14:18,167
He's a celebrity.

1021
01:14:24,414 --> 01:14:25,289
Good-bye.

1022
01:14:26,133 --> 01:14:27,566
I'll call again.

1023
01:14:39,334 --> 01:14:41,484
I saw the priest. What a nerve!

1024
01:14:41,694 --> 01:14:44,891
If he thinks his manoeuvres can
save him...

1025
01:14:45,093 --> 01:14:47,607
our troubles are far from over!
What do you think?

1026
01:14:48,173 --> 01:14:49,526
What do you think?

1027
01:14:50,454 --> 01:14:51,409
I don't know.

1028
01:14:53,853 --> 01:14:54,843
I don't know.

1029
01:15:09,294 --> 01:15:10,522
Amputate!

1030
01:15:11,973 --> 01:15:13,293
Excellent result!

1031
01:15:14,173 --> 01:15:16,607
That's the capital's ideas for you.

1032
01:15:17,254 --> 01:15:19,722
That's Paris! Cure everything!

1033
01:15:20,334 --> 01:15:23,690
Be clever without worrying about
the consequences!

1034
01:15:23,893 --> 01:15:25,771
That's not ourjob.

1035
01:15:25,973 --> 01:15:29,124
We're not scientists and fops!

1036
01:15:29,334 --> 01:15:31,609
We're practitioners and we don't...

1037
01:15:31,813 --> 01:15:33,451
operate on a healthy person!

1038
01:15:34,494 --> 01:15:37,929
Straighten a clubfoot! How can it
be done?

1039
01:15:38,614 --> 01:15:40,205
Why not a hunchback!

1040
01:15:41,614 --> 01:15:43,047
Amputate the leg...

1041
01:15:43,933 --> 01:15:44,888
to mid-thigh.

1042
01:15:53,973 --> 01:15:56,329
I took every possible precaution.

1043
01:15:57,374 --> 01:15:58,966
It's fate.

1044
01:16:01,734 --> 01:16:03,770
If that poor lad should die...

1045
01:16:04,254 --> 01:16:07,245
I'll have murdered him. Everyone
will know.

1046
01:16:08,093 --> 01:16:09,891
I'll be dishonoured.

1047
01:16:11,654 --> 01:16:13,053
You're getting on my nerves!

1048
01:16:24,614 --> 01:16:27,411
She remembered the privations
of her soul...

1049
01:16:27,614 --> 01:16:30,491
her dreams in the mud, like
wounded swallows...

1050
01:16:30,694 --> 01:16:33,333
the things she'd wanted and
denied herself...

1051
01:16:33,534 --> 01:16:36,890
everything she could have had!
But why? Why?

1052
01:16:40,414 --> 01:16:43,450
She repented her past virtue as if
it were a crime.

1053
01:16:44,053 --> 01:16:47,569
The thought of her lover came
back to charm her.

1054
01:16:47,774 --> 01:16:49,002
She gave herself up...

1055
01:16:49,214 --> 01:16:52,763
and Charles seemed as alien and
distant as ever...

1056
01:16:52,973 --> 01:16:55,647
as impossible and down-cast as a
dying man...

1057
01:16:55,853 --> 01:16:58,084
who was in agony before her.

1058
01:17:07,093 --> 01:17:08,446
Stand aside!

1059
01:17:24,374 --> 01:17:25,567
Kiss me.

1060
01:17:35,093 --> 01:17:36,606
- Kiss me.
- Let me go!

1061
01:17:37,093 --> 01:17:37,843
What's wrong?

1062
01:17:38,053 --> 01:17:39,453
You know I love you.

1063
01:17:40,494 --> 01:17:41,244
Enough!

1064
01:17:45,694 --> 01:17:47,888
Their love began again.

1065
01:18:00,973 --> 01:18:02,646
You've no idea how bored I am.

1066
01:18:03,614 --> 01:18:04,932
My husband is hateful.

1067
01:18:05,614 --> 01:18:07,490
I only feel repulsion for him.

1068
01:18:08,614 --> 01:18:10,410
My life is horrible.

1069
01:18:11,334 --> 01:18:13,484
Yes, dear. But what can I do about
it?

1070
01:18:14,654 --> 01:18:15,609
If you wanted...

1071
01:18:15,813 --> 01:18:16,610
What?

1072
01:18:17,534 --> 01:18:20,651
We could go away... somewhere
else.

1073
01:18:21,654 --> 01:18:23,053
You're truly mad!

1074
01:18:31,893 --> 01:18:33,043
Is that a new dress?

1075
01:18:43,254 --> 01:18:44,972
Buy Hippolyte a wooden leg.

1076
01:18:48,534 --> 01:18:49,284
Should I?

1077
01:18:50,654 --> 01:18:52,087
It's the least you can do.

1078
01:19:16,774 --> 01:19:18,765
That dress looks delightful.

1079
01:19:20,973 --> 01:19:23,044
I have a surprise for you.

1080
01:19:31,494 --> 01:19:34,371
I think this is what you wanted.

1081
01:19:35,374 --> 01:19:37,205
It's superb, M. Lheureux.

1082
01:19:37,414 --> 01:19:39,484
I'm happy you like it.

1083
01:19:41,973 --> 01:19:44,692
Mme Bovary, I regret this but...

1084
01:19:45,334 --> 01:19:47,893
an unfortunate chain of events...

1085
01:19:48,093 --> 01:19:51,290
bad debtors and important
purchases...

1086
01:19:51,973 --> 01:19:55,682
force me to ask you for the money
you owe me.

1087
01:19:56,774 --> 01:19:58,968
The total comes to 270 francs.

1088
01:20:00,053 --> 01:20:02,044
Forgive me, but it's quite urgent.

1089
01:20:02,254 --> 01:20:05,883
I wouldn't like to have to take the
goods back.

1090
01:20:06,093 --> 01:20:08,004
I'll pay you, M. Lheureux.

1091
01:20:08,454 --> 01:20:10,445
We can come to an arrangement.

1092
01:20:10,654 --> 01:20:12,371
No, I'll pay you.

1093
01:20:15,374 --> 01:20:16,602
Why buy me presents?

1094
01:20:17,254 --> 01:20:18,243
Because I love you.

1095
01:20:19,574 --> 01:20:20,723
It's embarrassing for me.

1096
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:22,450
Don't be silly.

1097
01:20:24,053 --> 01:20:24,929
Do you love me?

1098
01:20:25,133 --> 01:20:25,804
Of course I do.

1099
01:20:26,294 --> 01:20:27,169
Very much?

1100
01:20:27,374 --> 01:20:28,284
Definitely.

1101
01:20:28,694 --> 01:20:29,763
Then let's go.

1102
01:20:30,494 --> 01:20:33,566
Take me away! Four years of
suffering. I'm dying!

1103
01:20:34,173 --> 01:20:36,051
They torture me. Save me!

1104
01:20:36,694 --> 01:20:37,524
What do you want?

1105
01:20:37,734 --> 01:20:39,167
Take me away! I beg you!

1106
01:20:39,933 --> 01:20:40,525
And Berthe?

1107
01:20:42,133 --> 01:20:43,249
We'll take her too.

1108
01:20:44,933 --> 01:20:45,763
What a woman!

1109
01:20:47,973 --> 01:20:49,646
Well, will you take me?

1110
01:20:50,574 --> 01:20:52,848
Let me think. I have things to sort
out.

1111
01:20:53,294 --> 01:20:54,169
Will you take me?

1112
01:21:15,893 --> 01:21:19,044
Mme Bovary was never more
beautiful than at this time.

1113
01:21:19,254 --> 01:21:21,484
She had that indefinable
beauty...

1114
01:21:21,694 --> 01:21:24,731
which springs from joy,
enthusiasm and success...

1115
01:21:24,933 --> 01:21:28,529
and which is the harmony of
temperament and circumstance.

1116
01:21:29,774 --> 01:21:31,127
I'm here to see you.

1117
01:21:32,173 --> 01:21:34,687
I understood you were having
problems.

1118
01:21:34,893 --> 01:21:37,044
So I'm here to pay my debts.

1119
01:21:38,973 --> 01:21:40,726
I'll be needing a coat.

1120
01:21:40,933 --> 01:21:44,005
A long coat with a thick collar and
lining.

1121
01:21:44,454 --> 01:21:45,807
Are you going on ajourney?

1122
01:21:46,013 --> 01:21:48,732
No. I'm counting on you. As fast as
possible.

1123
01:21:49,774 --> 01:21:53,527
I'll need a small trunk, a light,
practical one.

1124
01:21:54,053 --> 01:21:57,250
Three feet by one and a half, the
standard model.

1125
01:21:57,454 --> 01:21:58,967
With a night-bag.

1126
01:21:59,173 --> 01:22:00,163
Perfect.

1127
01:22:00,374 --> 01:22:02,330
Take this. Use it to pay.

1128
01:22:02,534 --> 01:22:04,650
There's no need for that!

1129
01:22:04,853 --> 01:22:06,844
We know each other. I trust you.

1130
01:22:07,053 --> 01:22:09,249
I insist. At least take the chain.

1131
01:22:10,574 --> 01:22:12,768
Leave everything here.

1132
01:22:12,973 --> 01:22:14,201
As for the coat...

1133
01:22:15,494 --> 01:22:16,687
don't bring it to the house.

1134
01:22:16,893 --> 01:22:19,966
Give me the address and have it
made ready.

1135
01:22:20,454 --> 01:22:23,651
Is everything ready? Are you
sure?

1136
01:22:24,614 --> 01:22:25,807
Are you sad?

1137
01:22:26,013 --> 01:22:27,208
No, why?

1138
01:22:27,774 --> 01:22:30,766
Are you sad to leave this place
and start anew?

1139
01:22:31,414 --> 01:22:34,406
I have nothing here. You're
everything I have!

1140
01:22:34,774 --> 01:22:36,605
I'll be everything to you...

1141
01:22:36,813 --> 01:22:38,804
your family and your home!

1142
01:22:40,254 --> 01:22:41,732
You're so charming.

1143
01:22:42,374 --> 01:22:44,842
Is it true? Do you love me? Swear
it.

1144
01:22:45,214 --> 01:22:46,203
Do I love you?

1145
01:22:47,813 --> 01:22:49,804
Do I love you? I adore you!

1146
01:22:51,694 --> 01:22:54,208
Oh, Rodolphe, I'm too happy!

1147
01:22:57,093 --> 01:22:58,846
My darling Rodolphe.

1148
01:23:17,334 --> 01:23:18,129
Midnight!

1149
01:23:19,254 --> 01:23:20,322
It's tomorrow.

1150
01:23:21,214 --> 01:23:22,487
One more day.

1151
01:23:23,973 --> 01:23:25,293
You have the passports?

1152
01:23:27,173 --> 01:23:28,401
Forgotten anything?

1153
01:23:30,494 --> 01:23:31,722
Are you sure?

1154
01:23:33,053 --> 01:23:34,089
I'm sure.

1155
01:23:34,774 --> 01:23:38,129
You'll wait at the Hotel de
Provence at midday?

1156
01:23:40,813 --> 01:23:42,293
See you tomorrow.

1157
01:23:48,853 --> 01:23:49,843
Till tomorrow.

1158
01:23:51,294 --> 01:23:52,932
"Be brave, Emma, be brave.

1159
01:23:53,973 --> 01:23:56,283
I don't wish to ruin your life.

1160
01:23:56,574 --> 01:23:59,042
I was leading you to an abyss.

1161
01:23:59,254 --> 01:24:00,527
Oh Emma, forget me.

1162
01:24:01,093 --> 01:24:04,723
Why did I have to meet you? Why
were you so beautiful?

1163
01:24:04,933 --> 01:24:06,161
Is it my fault?

1164
01:24:06,774 --> 01:24:09,766
Heavens, no, blame only fate.

1165
01:24:10,694 --> 01:24:12,207
The world is cruel, Emma.

1166
01:24:12,414 --> 01:24:15,803
Everywhere, there would have
been awkward questions...

1167
01:24:16,013 --> 01:24:18,049
gossip and perhaps even insults.

1168
01:24:18,933 --> 01:24:21,401
I'll be gone when you read these
sad lines.

1169
01:24:21,614 --> 01:24:24,969
I must flee to avoid the
temptation of seeing you again.

1170
01:24:25,654 --> 01:24:26,404
Farewell.

1171
01:24:27,534 --> 01:24:28,852
Your friend, Rodolphe. "

1172
01:24:32,053 --> 01:24:33,726
He read the letter through.

1173
01:24:35,214 --> 01:24:36,727
He found it good.

1174
01:24:41,694 --> 01:24:42,524
Is madame in?

1175
01:24:42,734 --> 01:24:43,848
This is for her.

1176
01:24:44,294 --> 01:24:45,089
Give it to me.

1177
01:24:45,294 --> 01:24:47,569
No, I have to give it personally.

1178
01:24:51,294 --> 01:24:53,012
My master sent this, ma'am.

1179
01:24:53,214 --> 01:24:54,089
Give him a coin.

1180
01:26:12,534 --> 01:26:15,606
The master's waiting. The meal's
ready.

1181
01:26:20,013 --> 01:26:22,687
Emma! where are you?

1182
01:26:23,734 --> 01:26:24,848
Come on!

1183
01:26:37,853 --> 01:26:38,525
I knew it.

1184
01:26:39,053 --> 01:26:41,009
That vinegar would wake a dead
man.

1185
01:26:42,774 --> 01:26:43,888
Speak to us!

1186
01:26:47,214 --> 01:26:48,124
It's me...

1187
01:26:48,614 --> 01:26:50,205
your loving Charles.

1188
01:26:56,694 --> 01:27:00,049
Here's your little girl. Kiss her.

1189
01:27:05,893 --> 01:27:06,803
No one...

1190
01:27:12,694 --> 01:27:13,682
The poor thing.

1191
01:27:14,813 --> 01:27:17,328
- She's gone again.
- No, she's sleeping.

1192
01:27:17,534 --> 01:27:21,321
The fit's over. What could have
made her faint?

1193
01:27:21,933 --> 01:27:23,571
Be careful not to wake her.

1194
01:27:23,853 --> 01:27:27,051
One of my friends, Brideux, in
Forges...

1195
01:27:27,254 --> 01:27:30,768
owns a dog that has a fit when it
sniffs a snuff-box.

1196
01:27:31,574 --> 01:27:32,723
Isn't that strange?

1197
01:27:34,574 --> 01:27:36,165
A fever set in...

1198
01:27:36,374 --> 01:27:39,525
and for 43 days, Charles didn't
leave her side...

1199
01:27:39,734 --> 01:27:43,009
neglected his patients and stopped
sleeping.

1200
01:27:43,214 --> 01:27:44,089
Her strength...

1201
01:27:44,294 --> 01:27:46,091
returned when the paths...

1202
01:27:46,294 --> 01:27:48,410
were covered with autumn leaves.

1203
01:27:49,614 --> 01:27:51,252
Don't tire yourself.

1204
01:27:56,494 --> 01:27:58,290
Sit on the bench there.

1205
01:27:59,173 --> 01:28:01,529
No, not there!

1206
01:28:01,853 --> 01:28:02,763
You'll be all right.

1207
01:28:08,933 --> 01:28:11,527
Am I disturbing you? I'm here to
ask...

1208
01:28:11,734 --> 01:28:12,405
about Emma.

1209
01:28:12,614 --> 01:28:14,763
You know you're always welcome.

1210
01:28:16,813 --> 01:28:18,850
I was doing my accounts.

1211
01:28:19,294 --> 01:28:20,647
I don't know how...

1212
01:28:21,254 --> 01:28:23,562
to pay for all the medicine I've
had.

1213
01:28:23,774 --> 01:28:25,446
You owe me nothing.

1214
01:28:25,853 --> 01:28:28,447
I'm much obliged but I'm
embarrassed.

1215
01:28:28,734 --> 01:28:31,248
The season hasn't been too good.

1216
01:28:32,494 --> 01:28:34,450
I was so busy with the poor dear.

1217
01:28:34,654 --> 01:28:35,768
How is she?

1218
01:28:37,534 --> 01:28:40,890
A lot better but she still has
short relapses.

1219
01:28:42,614 --> 01:28:45,526
I have to be so very careful.

1220
01:28:47,774 --> 01:28:50,288
She's resting now. The priest's
with her.

1221
01:28:51,173 --> 01:28:54,165
Bournissien? I hear he's often
here.

1222
01:28:54,374 --> 01:28:57,207
I hope she's not turning religious
on us.

1223
01:28:57,853 --> 01:29:01,402
She tells me faith is a great
comfort to her.

1224
01:29:02,334 --> 01:29:04,642
In my view, you should take her
out...

1225
01:29:04,853 --> 01:29:06,207
take her to the theatre.

1226
01:29:06,414 --> 01:29:09,212
I'd come too if I could get away.

1227
01:29:09,454 --> 01:29:12,048
Logardy is giving a concert in
Rouen...

1228
01:29:12,254 --> 01:29:14,164
before leaving for England.

1229
01:30:26,374 --> 01:30:28,092
I didn't understand everything...

1230
01:30:28,294 --> 01:30:30,444
but I quite like it.

1231
01:30:33,734 --> 01:30:35,531
Would you like some barley
water?

1232
01:30:35,734 --> 01:30:37,531
Yes please. It's so hot.

1233
01:30:55,093 --> 01:30:57,527
I never thought I'd get away. Such
a crush.

1234
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:02,013
Guess who I bumped into?

1235
01:31:02,454 --> 01:31:03,647
Monsieur Leon!

1236
01:31:04,254 --> 01:31:05,004
Leon?

1237
01:31:05,214 --> 01:31:08,410
None other. He's coming to pay his
respects.

1238
01:31:12,093 --> 01:31:13,243
You're back in Rouen?

1239
01:31:14,214 --> 01:31:15,124
Since when?

1240
01:31:15,334 --> 01:31:16,607
Be quiet or leave!

1241
01:31:16,813 --> 01:31:18,486
Come on, it's hot and I'm bored.

1242
01:31:18,694 --> 01:31:19,808
Stay a little.

1243
01:31:20,013 --> 01:31:21,766
Please, I'm stifling. Let's go.

1244
01:31:22,093 --> 01:31:23,572
True, it is hot.

1245
01:31:26,774 --> 01:31:27,923
Does opera bore you?

1246
01:31:28,133 --> 01:31:29,283
You can't imagine.

1247
01:31:32,734 --> 01:31:34,725
I returned from Paris last week.

1248
01:31:34,933 --> 01:31:38,164
I'm spending two years here to
learn the trade.

1249
01:31:39,093 --> 01:31:42,563
Business isn't the same here as in
Paris.

1250
01:31:42,774 --> 01:31:44,890
How's Berthe? And the Homais?

1251
01:31:45,734 --> 01:31:47,690
Berthe has grown a lot.

1252
01:31:49,053 --> 01:31:49,770
The Homais...

1253
01:31:49,973 --> 01:31:51,043
Are very well.

1254
01:31:55,654 --> 01:31:57,245
They seem satisfied...

1255
01:31:57,454 --> 01:31:59,524
but after Rubini or Gresi...

1256
01:31:59,734 --> 01:32:02,248
Lagardy isn't much despite all his
noise.

1257
01:32:02,774 --> 01:32:05,241
He's supposed to be good in the
last act.

1258
01:32:07,133 --> 01:32:10,092
It's a shame we left before the
end.

1259
01:32:10,294 --> 01:32:12,524
He's performing again in two days.

1260
01:32:12,734 --> 01:32:14,611
We're leaving tomorrow.

1261
01:32:15,813 --> 01:32:18,453
Unless you want to stay, my pet.

1262
01:32:18,654 --> 01:32:20,292
It could do you good.

1263
01:32:20,734 --> 01:32:24,044
Lagardy is quite sublime in the
last act.

1264
01:32:25,093 --> 01:32:26,572
I'm sorry I felt ill.

1265
01:32:26,774 --> 01:32:29,129
Stay! Come back on Sunday.

1266
01:32:30,013 --> 01:32:31,413
If you want to...

1267
01:32:31,614 --> 01:32:33,285
it means it's good for you.

1268
01:32:35,214 --> 01:32:36,362
Allow me...

1269
01:32:37,093 --> 01:32:37,890
Leon...

1270
01:32:38,973 --> 01:32:41,204
you shouldn't, really...

1271
01:32:42,654 --> 01:32:44,690
It's agreed, then? Tomorrow at
six.

1272
01:32:44,893 --> 01:32:48,409
Unfortunately, I have to go home.
But you, Emma...

1273
01:32:49,614 --> 01:32:50,649
It's just...

1274
01:32:52,334 --> 01:32:53,562
I'm not sure...

1275
01:32:54,813 --> 01:32:57,123
Think about it and we'll see.

1276
01:32:57,334 --> 01:32:59,802
Just sleep on it.

1277
01:33:01,173 --> 01:33:04,132
Now that you're back in these
parts...

1278
01:33:04,334 --> 01:33:07,007
I hope you'll come to dinner from
time to time.

1279
01:33:07,214 --> 01:33:08,806
You can count on it.

1280
01:33:09,013 --> 01:33:11,574
I have to go to Yonville on
business.

1281
01:33:15,774 --> 01:33:16,570
Good-night.

1282
01:33:45,294 --> 01:33:46,852
M. and Mme Bovary, please.

1283
01:33:47,093 --> 01:33:49,654
Number seven, but the gentleman
left.

1284
01:33:59,534 --> 01:34:00,444
Oh, Leon...

1285
01:34:01,334 --> 01:34:03,052
I'm pleased to see you.

1286
01:34:03,933 --> 01:34:05,924
I didn't say where we were
staying.

1287
01:34:06,214 --> 01:34:07,408
I found you.

1288
01:34:08,933 --> 01:34:10,208
You decided to stay?

1289
01:34:10,454 --> 01:34:12,285
Yes, and I was wrong.

1290
01:34:15,093 --> 01:34:18,768
One shouldn't acquire such tastes
when one's so busy.

1291
01:34:19,093 --> 01:34:20,288
I can imagine.

1292
01:34:20,534 --> 01:34:23,332
No you can't, you're not a woman.

1293
01:34:26,133 --> 01:34:28,329
If only you knew of my dreams!

1294
01:34:29,774 --> 01:34:31,002
And mine!

1295
01:34:32,534 --> 01:34:33,807
I've suffered too.

1296
01:34:35,494 --> 01:34:37,245
I'd wander along the Seine.

1297
01:34:37,774 --> 01:34:41,164
A print-seller had an engraving of
a Muse.

1298
01:34:43,173 --> 01:34:45,529
I'd stare at it for hours on end.

1299
01:34:47,013 --> 01:34:48,208
She looked like you.

1300
01:34:50,813 --> 01:34:52,804
I'd tear up my letters to you.

1301
01:34:53,813 --> 01:34:56,647
But why? Why?

1302
01:34:59,334 --> 01:35:00,892
Because I loved you.

1303
01:35:03,374 --> 01:35:05,250
I always thought so...

1304
01:35:13,494 --> 01:35:14,449
So...

1305
01:35:14,774 --> 01:35:15,728
So?

1306
01:35:19,494 --> 01:35:22,929
Why is it nobody has ever
expressed such feelings to me?

1307
01:35:24,374 --> 01:35:27,172
An idealistic soul is hard to understand.

1308
01:35:30,614 --> 01:35:32,605
If only we'd met sooner...

1309
01:35:32,893 --> 01:35:34,406
I've often thought that.

1310
01:35:35,053 --> 01:35:36,043
What a dream!

1311
01:35:37,734 --> 01:35:38,962
We could start now.

1312
01:35:39,173 --> 01:35:42,405
No, my friend! I'm too old... and
you're too young.

1313
01:35:42,853 --> 01:35:45,606
Forget me! You'll love others.

1314
01:35:46,133 --> 01:35:47,486
Not like you!

1315
01:35:48,173 --> 01:35:49,652
What a child you are.

1316
01:35:49,893 --> 01:35:52,487
Please, be good. I want you to.

1317
01:35:56,013 --> 01:35:56,890
Forgive me!

1318
01:35:57,933 --> 01:36:01,449
Heavens, it's late! I forgot all
about the concert.

1319
01:36:01,694 --> 01:36:04,083
Poor Bovary left me here for that.

1320
01:36:05,214 --> 01:36:06,932
I must go home tomorrow.

1321
01:36:07,614 --> 01:36:08,490
Really?

1322
01:36:10,614 --> 01:36:14,004
It's impossible. I've something I
must tell you.

1323
01:36:14,214 --> 01:36:15,727
Haven't you understood?

1324
01:36:16,414 --> 01:36:17,529
You speak well.

1325
01:36:17,813 --> 01:36:19,486
Please don't joke.

1326
01:36:20,694 --> 01:36:22,843
Let me see you just once more.

1327
01:36:25,893 --> 01:36:26,770
Not here anyway.

1328
01:36:27,013 --> 01:36:28,003
Wherever!

1329
01:36:29,534 --> 01:36:30,489
Oh, Lord.

1330
01:36:33,734 --> 01:36:36,373
Tomorrow at eleven in the
cathedral.

1331
01:36:38,574 --> 01:36:39,484
You're mad.

1332
01:36:39,774 --> 01:36:40,888
You're mad!

1333
01:36:44,973 --> 01:36:45,850
Till tomorrow.

1334
01:36:57,133 --> 01:37:00,524
Does the gentleman wish to visit
the church?

1335
01:37:14,414 --> 01:37:16,723
Does madame wish to visit the
church?

1336
01:37:16,933 --> 01:37:19,731
No, we don't wish to visit the
church.

1337
01:37:21,973 --> 01:37:22,963
Why not?

1338
01:37:23,734 --> 01:37:25,725
Because... I have other plans.

1339
01:37:26,494 --> 01:37:28,245
Thank you, you're so kind.

1340
01:37:49,574 --> 01:37:50,450
Come along.

1341
01:37:50,893 --> 01:37:51,928
Where are we going?

1342
01:37:55,214 --> 01:37:56,886
- Get me a cab.
- Yes, sir.

1343
01:37:59,133 --> 01:38:00,249
Oh, Leon, really...

1344
01:38:02,214 --> 01:38:03,692
I don't know if I should.

1345
01:38:09,853 --> 01:38:11,082
It's not done.

1346
01:38:11,294 --> 01:38:12,204
What?

1347
01:38:13,334 --> 01:38:15,893
It's done in Paris all the time.

1348
01:38:30,334 --> 01:38:32,164
- Where to, sir?
- Wherever!

1349
01:38:43,534 --> 01:38:54,047
Carry on! Carry on!

1350
01:38:55,334 --> 01:38:56,402
Move on!

1351
01:38:57,694 --> 01:39:00,571
Wait, Hivert! Wait! Wait for me!

1352
01:39:03,654 --> 01:39:04,803
Wait a minute.

1353
01:39:05,053 --> 01:39:07,887
My trunk's ready. I'll be right
down.

1354
01:39:09,414 --> 01:39:10,369
Madame Bovary...

1355
01:39:11,254 --> 01:39:13,484
you have to go to see M. Homais.

1356
01:39:13,734 --> 01:39:15,325
It's urgent.

1357
01:39:15,534 --> 01:39:16,649
I'll go home first.

1358
01:39:16,893 --> 01:39:20,124
No, it's very urgent, you have to go
right now.

1359
01:39:20,414 --> 01:39:22,325
Hippolyte will take your trunk.

1360
01:39:45,374 --> 01:39:47,569
Are you mad? Look what you've
done!

1361
01:39:49,173 --> 01:39:50,129
What's wrong?

1362
01:39:50,494 --> 01:39:52,610
I asked him to fetch a bowl...

1363
01:39:52,774 --> 01:39:54,651
for the extra red-currants.

1364
01:39:54,853 --> 01:39:57,288
So he went to the store to get it.

1365
01:39:57,574 --> 01:39:59,803
Do you know what we have in
there?

1366
01:40:00,053 --> 01:40:02,614
Did you see the bottle full of
white powder...

1367
01:40:03,093 --> 01:40:04,812
with the label saying "dangerous"?

1368
01:40:05,053 --> 01:40:07,409
Know what's in it, idiot? Arsenic!

1369
01:40:07,654 --> 01:40:09,610
And you took the bowl next to it!

1370
01:40:09,933 --> 01:40:12,572
Next to the arsenic? You'll kill us!

1371
01:40:12,813 --> 01:40:14,008
Us or a patient!

1372
01:40:14,214 --> 01:40:17,683
You want to see me in court, don't
you?

1373
01:40:17,973 --> 01:40:21,011
I wonder why I bother helping you.

1374
01:40:21,173 --> 01:40:24,563
I should have let you wallow in
your filth!

1375
01:40:26,774 --> 01:40:30,004
You're useless. You can't even
stick labels!

1376
01:40:30,214 --> 01:40:33,683
And you live the high life, without
a care!

1377
01:40:37,494 --> 01:40:39,245
You sent for me?

1378
01:40:39,454 --> 01:40:42,286
Clean that up. Hurry, you murderer!

1379
01:40:42,614 --> 01:40:44,365
You've something to tell me?

1380
01:40:46,534 --> 01:40:48,570
Ah, yes. Your father-in-law is
dead.

1381
01:40:55,414 --> 01:40:57,484
- My dear...
- Yes, I know...

1382
01:41:01,774 --> 01:41:03,571
If only I could have seen him.

1383
01:41:03,774 --> 01:41:05,571
How old was he?

1384
01:41:05,774 --> 01:41:07,093
Sixty-one.

1385
01:41:09,574 --> 01:41:11,565
My poor mother...

1386
01:41:12,654 --> 01:41:14,485
what will become of her?

1387
01:41:18,334 --> 01:41:19,482
Did you have fun?

1388
01:41:33,013 --> 01:41:33,968
Pretty bouquet.

1389
01:41:34,214 --> 01:41:36,852
Yes, I bought it from a beggar
earlier.

1390
01:41:37,614 --> 01:41:39,763
The next day his mother arrived.

1391
01:41:42,654 --> 01:41:44,848
Allow me, at this trying time...

1392
01:41:45,254 --> 01:41:47,687
to present my sincere
condolences...

1393
01:41:47,933 --> 01:41:50,289
and put myself at your disposal.

1394
01:41:51,574 --> 01:41:54,008
You're very kind but we need
nothing.

1395
01:41:54,893 --> 01:41:56,213
Excuse me but...

1396
01:41:56,534 --> 01:41:59,843
I'd like to have a word in private.

1397
01:42:00,813 --> 01:42:03,566
About that matter... you know?

1398
01:42:04,694 --> 01:42:06,730
Ah, yes! Of course...

1399
01:42:08,093 --> 01:42:09,209
Emma, my dear...

1400
01:42:10,133 --> 01:42:13,170
Could you... I don't want to leave
mother.

1401
01:42:17,614 --> 01:42:20,082
I'm sure your present sorrow...

1402
01:42:20,294 --> 01:42:23,730
will find some financial comfort
in the will.

1403
01:42:24,694 --> 01:42:27,844
I'm delighted for you and, I must
say, for your husband.

1404
01:42:28,654 --> 01:42:30,053
While you were ill...

1405
01:42:30,374 --> 01:42:33,013
he was in such a state!

1406
01:42:33,614 --> 01:42:37,289
I can tell you, now that you're
well again...

1407
01:42:37,534 --> 01:42:40,491
We had a few problems.

1408
01:42:41,454 --> 01:42:43,490
Problems? What sort of
problems?

1409
01:42:43,853 --> 01:42:46,493
You know. Those little fancies of
yours.

1410
01:42:46,734 --> 01:42:49,406
The travelling-cases, the coat...

1411
01:42:50,933 --> 01:42:54,687
We made it up. I can now suggest
another arrangement.

1412
01:42:55,093 --> 01:42:58,370
This misfortune will give him so
much to do.

1413
01:42:58,574 --> 01:43:01,929
I could renew the note he signed
for me.

1414
01:43:02,214 --> 01:43:05,843
He'd do best to transfer it to
somebody else.

1415
01:43:06,053 --> 01:43:09,410
You, for instance. A proxy would
make it easy...

1416
01:43:09,654 --> 01:43:13,441
and we could easily sort out our
matters.

1417
01:43:14,173 --> 01:43:17,768
Maitre Guillaumin has prepared
the papers...

1418
01:43:18,093 --> 01:43:20,767
to manage and administer his
business.

1419
01:43:21,893 --> 01:43:24,124
You could take out loans...

1420
01:43:24,414 --> 01:43:27,531
sign and endorse his notes...

1421
01:43:27,853 --> 01:43:30,731
Monsieur will do as he sees fit.

1422
01:43:30,973 --> 01:43:32,929
But I think...

1423
01:43:33,614 --> 01:43:35,683
Where's this from?

1424
01:43:35,853 --> 01:43:37,082
Maitre Guillaumin.

1425
01:43:38,534 --> 01:43:41,651
I don't trust him. Notaries are
renowned crooks.

1426
01:43:41,853 --> 01:43:44,004
We need a competent opinion.

1427
01:43:47,334 --> 01:43:49,005
But we don't know anyone.

1428
01:43:50,334 --> 01:43:53,053
We do... We could ask Leon.

1429
01:43:53,694 --> 01:43:56,083
Yes! That's a good idea.

1430
01:43:57,853 --> 01:43:59,207
We'll have to go to Rouen.

1431
01:44:02,153 --> 01:44:03,428
I'll write to him.

1432
01:44:03,594 --> 01:44:07,586
Charles, this can't be done by
correspondence.

1433
01:44:07,954 --> 01:44:09,945
No. Since I have to, I'll go.

1434
01:44:11,473 --> 01:44:12,509
You're so good.

1435
01:44:14,634 --> 01:44:17,193
The next day, she took the
Hirondelle...

1436
01:44:17,393 --> 01:44:19,349
to consult Leon in Rouen.

1437
01:44:19,554 --> 01:44:21,509
She stayed three days.

1438
01:44:21,674 --> 01:44:25,508
Three full, gorgeous, superb
days, a real honeymoon.

1439
01:44:26,634 --> 01:44:28,704
Don't move. Don't speak.

1440
01:44:29,273 --> 01:44:30,593
Look at me.

1441
01:44:31,754 --> 01:44:34,108
There's something so soft in your
eyes...

1442
01:44:34,353 --> 01:44:35,911
which does me good.

1443
01:44:37,874 --> 01:44:39,387
Child, do you love me?

1444
01:44:45,153 --> 01:44:48,669
You'll leave me, you'll marry. Like
the others.

1445
01:44:48,874 --> 01:44:50,102
What others?

1446
01:44:50,594 --> 01:44:52,424
Other men, of course!

1447
01:44:57,634 --> 01:44:59,464
You're all vile.

1448
01:45:01,634 --> 01:45:03,352
Do you ever think of Paris?

1449
01:45:03,514 --> 01:45:06,074
No. Well... a little, of course.

1450
01:45:07,714 --> 01:45:09,830
We could live so well there.

1451
01:45:10,473 --> 01:45:12,304
Aren't we happy?

1452
01:45:12,473 --> 01:45:15,465
Yes, it's true. I'm mad. Kiss me.

1453
01:45:21,233 --> 01:45:23,031
- Will you come?
- As soon as I can.

1454
01:45:23,233 --> 01:45:24,428
Will you promise?

1455
01:45:24,634 --> 01:45:26,112
Do you think I need to?

1456
01:45:28,594 --> 01:45:29,822
Be careful, anyway.

1457
01:45:33,074 --> 01:45:34,302
I swear I'll come.

1458
01:45:34,473 --> 01:45:35,872
I mustn't miss the coach.

1459
01:45:36,914 --> 01:45:40,701
It blew so strong that day...

1460
01:45:40,874 --> 01:45:41,784
Good day, Hivert.

1461
01:45:46,834 --> 01:45:49,473
Madame Bovary, what a surprise.

1462
01:45:49,714 --> 01:45:52,068
The trip will be a delight.

1463
01:45:56,433 --> 01:45:57,583
I've ordered...

1464
01:45:57,794 --> 01:45:59,910
a few fine pieces of cloth.

1465
01:46:00,153 --> 01:46:02,668
I'll be delighted to show you.

1466
01:46:03,473 --> 01:46:05,304
We'll see about that.

1467
01:46:16,794 --> 01:46:19,467
Get lost, you filthy vermin!

1468
01:46:28,986 --> 01:46:30,897
Leon showed the document to a
colleague.

1469
01:46:33,826 --> 01:46:36,464
Yesterday, I was too tired to
travel back.

1470
01:46:37,706 --> 01:46:39,058
You weren't ill?

1471
01:46:39,266 --> 01:46:41,460
No, I told you, I was tired.

1472
01:46:41,665 --> 01:46:44,339
He was worried. You could have
sent word.

1473
01:46:44,545 --> 01:46:46,501
I told him I'd need two days.

1474
01:46:46,665 --> 01:46:48,144
Two days, not three.

1475
01:46:49,066 --> 01:46:52,023
Mother, it doesn't matter.

1476
01:46:52,545 --> 01:46:55,982
Leon is positive that the document
is perfectly in order.

1477
01:46:56,545 --> 01:46:58,376
What document?

1478
01:46:59,706 --> 01:47:01,741
Nothing important, mother.

1479
01:47:02,585 --> 01:47:05,622
A sort of proxy...

1480
01:47:05,866 --> 01:47:07,697
to enable Emma...

1481
01:47:08,425 --> 01:47:11,816
to take care of household matters
more easily.

1482
01:47:11,946 --> 01:47:14,016
A proxy for your wife?

1483
01:47:14,345 --> 01:47:15,222
Are you mad?

1484
01:47:15,385 --> 01:47:16,340
Mother!

1485
01:47:18,706 --> 01:47:20,344
Not everyone's rich...

1486
01:47:20,866 --> 01:47:23,380
and no fortune lasts forever.

1487
01:47:24,266 --> 01:47:26,063
Was the carpet needed?

1488
01:47:26,226 --> 01:47:29,023
Why change the chair covering?

1489
01:47:29,266 --> 01:47:30,824
It's all vain fancy!

1490
01:47:30,986 --> 01:47:32,977
Silk for linings!

1491
01:47:33,146 --> 01:47:36,263
I'd be ashamed of such comfort...

1492
01:47:36,505 --> 01:47:38,303
and yet I'm old.

1493
01:47:38,545 --> 01:47:40,501
Enough, madame!

1494
01:47:40,746 --> 01:47:42,701
I'll tear the order up!

1495
01:47:46,786 --> 01:47:49,219
Mother, you're causing trouble

1496
01:47:50,385 --> 01:47:52,103
It's all show.

1497
01:47:55,106 --> 01:47:56,299
Shall I burn it?

1498
01:47:56,866 --> 01:47:57,901
Please do.

1499
01:47:58,106 --> 01:48:00,460
This arrangement suits me.

1500
01:48:00,625 --> 01:48:02,456
Sorry mother, but you're wrong.

1501
01:48:05,106 --> 01:48:06,585
You love her more.

1502
01:48:06,786 --> 01:48:09,664
You're right. That's how it should
be.

1503
01:48:10,385 --> 01:48:11,865
I'll leave tomorrow.

1504
01:48:24,746 --> 01:48:27,134
Have you sorted everything out?

1505
01:48:27,305 --> 01:48:29,296
In your best interests, I think.

1506
01:48:29,545 --> 01:48:31,934
I've a buyer for your house in
Barneville.

1507
01:48:32,186 --> 01:48:34,255
M. Langlois has offered 4,000
francs.

1508
01:48:35,266 --> 01:48:36,255
A good price.

1509
01:48:36,425 --> 01:48:38,416
I have half the amount here.

1510
01:48:46,026 --> 01:48:47,424
I can pay my debts.

1511
01:48:48,425 --> 01:48:50,893
I'd be sorry to take back...

1512
01:48:51,106 --> 01:48:53,983
such an important sum so
suddenly.

1513
01:48:56,425 --> 01:48:57,335
What?

1514
01:48:58,505 --> 01:49:01,019
One can put anything on bills.

1515
01:49:01,226 --> 01:49:02,102
Here...

1516
01:49:03,106 --> 01:49:05,825
sign this, keep it all...

1517
01:49:06,066 --> 01:49:07,897
and put your mind at rest.

1518
01:49:19,146 --> 01:49:22,138
With the date, please, the date.

1519
01:49:22,345 --> 01:49:24,177
What excuse did you give?

1520
01:49:24,345 --> 01:49:27,143
I said I had a piano class twice a
week.

1521
01:49:27,345 --> 01:49:28,540
That costs money.

1522
01:49:28,786 --> 01:49:30,424
But I'm rich!

1523
01:49:30,866 --> 01:49:34,222
He didn't question her and
accepted her whims.

1524
01:49:34,385 --> 01:49:37,219
He was more her mistress than
she his.

1525
01:49:37,425 --> 01:49:40,862
Her tender words and kisses
carried off his soul.

1526
01:49:41,066 --> 01:49:43,625
Where had she learned such
corruption...

1527
01:49:43,826 --> 01:49:47,818
so deep and concealed that it
was almost immaterial?

1528
01:49:49,186 --> 01:49:51,302
One day, they parted early...

1529
01:49:51,505 --> 01:49:53,461
and, walking along the
boulevard...

1530
01:49:53,706 --> 01:49:55,741
she saw the walls of her
convent.

1531
01:49:55,986 --> 01:49:58,375
Her early married life, walks in
the woods...

1532
01:49:58,585 --> 01:50:02,134
the Vicomte waltzing all passed
before her eyes.

1533
01:50:02,385 --> 01:50:05,856
Leon suddenly seemed as remote
as the rest.

1534
01:50:06,385 --> 01:50:08,900
Yet I love him.

1535
01:50:09,465 --> 01:50:13,014
No matter, she wasn't happy.

1536
01:50:13,226 --> 01:50:14,978
She never had been.

1537
01:50:15,186 --> 01:50:18,781
Nothing was worth this quest.
Everything lied.

1538
01:50:21,706 --> 01:50:22,536
What is it?

1539
01:50:22,826 --> 01:50:24,384
A man in black brought it.

1540
01:50:24,625 --> 01:50:26,581
He said it was most urgent.

1541
01:50:26,826 --> 01:50:28,817
Law and justice to Mme Bovary.

1542
01:50:29,026 --> 01:50:29,583
What sentence?

1543
01:50:30,946 --> 01:50:33,460
Within twenty-four hours...

1544
01:50:33,665 --> 01:50:36,624
- ... pay the sum of 8,000 francs.
- What?

1545
01:50:36,906 --> 01:50:39,500
Forced by legal means...

1546
01:50:39,786 --> 01:50:42,174
and notably by the confiscation...

1547
01:50:42,385 --> 01:50:43,978
of her personal goods.

1548
01:50:44,706 --> 01:50:47,014
By buying on credit, borrowing...

1549
01:50:47,266 --> 01:50:48,824
signing notes...

1550
01:50:49,026 --> 01:50:51,380
she had gathered for Lheureux...

1551
01:50:51,585 --> 01:50:54,259
a sum that he was eager to
obtain.

1552
01:51:00,305 --> 01:51:01,625
Have you heard the news?

1553
01:51:03,746 --> 01:51:05,338
I suppose it's ajoke.

1554
01:51:08,545 --> 01:51:09,773
What do you mean?

1555
01:51:10,305 --> 01:51:12,058
My little lady...

1556
01:51:12,345 --> 01:51:15,576
did you think I'd supply you with
goods...

1557
01:51:15,786 --> 01:51:17,583
and money, out of kindness...

1558
01:51:17,746 --> 01:51:19,701
till the end of time?

1559
01:51:19,946 --> 01:51:22,824
I must recover my outlay. It's only
fair.

1560
01:51:24,026 --> 01:51:26,415
But just think: 8,000 francs!

1561
01:51:26,665 --> 01:51:30,420
The court upheld it and passed
judgement.

1562
01:51:32,226 --> 01:51:34,740
Anyway, you know it's not me.

1563
01:51:34,946 --> 01:51:37,300
It's my accountant, Vincart.

1564
01:51:39,425 --> 01:51:40,938
But couldn't you...

1565
01:51:41,826 --> 01:51:42,701
manage to...

1566
01:51:42,946 --> 01:51:44,264
I can't do a thing.

1567
01:51:44,465 --> 01:51:47,662
You don't know Vincart. He's worse
than an Arab.

1568
01:51:48,746 --> 01:51:51,704
Look, I didn't know. It's such a
surprise.

1569
01:51:51,946 --> 01:51:53,742
Whose fault is that?

1570
01:51:54,026 --> 01:51:57,655
I slave like a nigger while you're
enjoying yourself.

1571
01:51:58,066 --> 01:51:59,942
Don't you lecture me!

1572
01:52:00,266 --> 01:52:01,857
It won't do any harm.

1573
01:52:05,746 --> 01:52:08,862
I beg you to do something.

1574
01:52:10,266 --> 01:52:12,222
You're trying to seduce me!

1575
01:52:12,906 --> 01:52:14,134
You monster!

1576
01:52:14,345 --> 01:52:15,983
Oh, come, come.

1577
01:52:16,625 --> 01:52:18,104
I'll tell everyone about you.

1578
01:52:18,345 --> 01:52:20,735
I'll tell my husband.

1579
01:52:20,986 --> 01:52:23,818
Leave your poor husband out of
this.

1580
01:52:24,026 --> 01:52:27,018
Don't you think I can tell him a
thing or two?

1581
01:52:29,066 --> 01:52:31,260
I know it's not funny.

1582
01:52:31,505 --> 01:52:34,464
But debts never killed anyone.

1583
01:52:34,665 --> 01:52:37,657
When one has friends, like you...

1584
01:52:38,946 --> 01:52:40,697
Where can I find the money?

1585
01:52:40,906 --> 01:52:44,295
You have friends, I tell you...

1586
01:52:49,266 --> 01:52:50,619
I promise I'll sign...

1587
01:52:50,786 --> 01:52:52,378
You've signed enough.

1588
01:52:52,625 --> 01:52:54,934
- I'll sell...
- You've nothing to sell.

1589
01:52:57,906 --> 01:52:59,702
I really don't care.

1590
01:53:07,585 --> 01:53:11,499
Good day, madame, Maitre Hareng,
the bailiff.

1591
01:53:12,186 --> 01:53:14,938
I'm to draw up the list of the
goods...

1592
01:53:15,186 --> 01:53:18,336
to be confiscated. My two
witnesses...

1593
01:53:18,585 --> 01:53:20,098
Latour and Passepoil.

1594
01:53:27,026 --> 01:53:29,300
I won't take this phrenological
head...

1595
01:53:29,786 --> 01:53:32,141
no doubt a professional tool.

1596
01:53:32,385 --> 01:53:35,344
Let's say nine pans, five dishes...

1597
01:53:35,545 --> 01:53:38,458
three pots, four chairs...

1598
01:53:39,146 --> 01:53:40,295
two torches.

1599
01:53:45,146 --> 01:53:47,102
Very pretty. Quite charming!

1600
01:53:50,585 --> 01:53:54,464
The law allows me to leave a
guard for the goods.

1601
01:53:55,026 --> 01:53:58,461
But I'll take the responsibility...

1602
01:53:58,706 --> 01:54:00,219
of trusting you.

1603
01:54:00,465 --> 01:54:03,424
Latour and Passepoil will
guarantee...

1604
01:54:03,625 --> 01:54:07,255
the lawfulness of the operation.

1605
01:54:12,946 --> 01:54:16,063
Not a word of this to my husband,
understand?

1606
01:54:16,266 --> 01:54:17,824
Not a word.

1607
01:54:18,026 --> 01:54:20,175
I never say anything, ma'am.

1608
01:54:24,625 --> 01:54:26,423
It's turned chilly.

1609
01:54:30,986 --> 01:54:33,500
- I must go to Rouen tomorrow.
- Really?

1610
01:54:47,585 --> 01:54:48,382
Why're you here?

1611
01:54:48,625 --> 01:54:49,342
Are you busy?

1612
01:54:49,545 --> 01:54:51,901
No, but I didn't expect you today.

1613
01:54:52,146 --> 01:54:53,817
I need to talk. It's urgent.

1614
01:54:54,106 --> 01:54:57,018
I need you. I need 8,000 francs.

1615
01:54:57,226 --> 01:54:59,295
What? You must be mad!

1616
01:54:59,505 --> 01:55:03,294
No, not yet, not quite. Listen...

1617
01:55:03,746 --> 01:55:05,098
But what...

1618
01:55:05,266 --> 01:55:07,257
You must find the money.

1619
01:55:07,465 --> 01:55:08,375
How can I?

1620
01:55:08,585 --> 01:55:09,938
What a coward you are!

1621
01:55:10,226 --> 01:55:11,817
I'm sure you're panicking.

1622
01:55:11,986 --> 01:55:14,260
Perhaps a thousand cus would do.

1623
01:55:14,545 --> 01:55:17,184
All the more reason. You can find

1624
01:55:18,345 --> 01:55:20,063
Try!

1625
01:55:20,946 --> 01:55:22,344
I'll love you so!

1626
01:55:22,585 --> 01:55:23,780
But where? How?

1627
01:55:25,266 --> 01:55:26,778
If I were you, I'd know.

1628
01:55:27,026 --> 01:55:27,902
Where then?

1629
01:55:28,866 --> 01:55:29,854
Your office!

1630
01:55:30,425 --> 01:55:33,576
Her eyes blazed with a hellish
recklessness...

1631
01:55:33,826 --> 01:55:37,420
and the lids narrowed with
sensual encouragement.

1632
01:55:37,625 --> 01:55:40,014
The young man felt himself
weakening...

1633
01:55:40,226 --> 01:55:42,978
before the silent will of this
woman...

1634
01:55:43,186 --> 01:55:45,746
pushing him to commit a crime.
He took fright.

1635
01:55:46,986 --> 01:55:48,304
How stupid I am!

1636
01:55:49,186 --> 01:55:52,815
Morel's back. His father's rich. I'll
bring it tomorrow.

1637
01:55:53,545 --> 01:55:57,255
Tomorrow at three. I'm sure he'll
lend it to me.

1638
01:55:57,545 --> 01:55:59,058
My friend Morel, I mean.

1639
01:56:00,986 --> 01:56:02,782
My dear, I really must be going.

1640
01:56:34,545 --> 01:56:37,219
Careful now. There's medicine in
there.

1641
01:56:40,266 --> 01:56:43,894
Delighted to see you. I didn't know
you were here.

1642
01:56:44,066 --> 01:56:45,259
You'll liven up the journey.

1643
01:56:45,545 --> 01:56:49,255
Often on a summer's day.

1644
01:56:49,585 --> 01:56:52,702
Girls dream of love so gay.

1645
01:56:53,146 --> 01:56:55,740
They should be locked up and made
to work.

1646
01:56:55,986 --> 01:56:58,340
Progress moves at a snail's pace!

1647
01:56:58,545 --> 01:57:00,138
We wallow in barbarity!

1648
01:57:01,066 --> 01:57:05,139
That's a bad scrofulous disorder.

1649
01:57:05,625 --> 01:57:09,095
Instead of getting drunk, you
should start a diet.

1650
01:57:10,026 --> 01:57:12,220
I know a good cream for you.

1651
01:57:12,706 --> 01:57:16,255
Well, I hope you'll do a show for
us now.

1652
01:57:31,146 --> 01:57:33,262
Ma'am! It's a scandal!

1653
01:57:33,465 --> 01:57:34,420
What's wrong?

1654
01:57:34,665 --> 01:57:36,781
There are bills posted on the
square.

1655
01:57:38,465 --> 01:57:39,500
Does my husband know?

1656
01:57:39,706 --> 01:57:42,266
No, he left early. I was just up.

1657
01:57:44,425 --> 01:57:47,384
If I were you, I'd go to see the
notary.

1658
01:57:47,545 --> 01:57:51,220
Do you think so? We hardly know
him.

1659
01:57:51,385 --> 01:57:52,613
I'd go anyway.

1660
01:57:55,906 --> 01:57:57,782
I should have the money later.

1661
01:57:57,986 --> 01:58:00,500
Seeing Maitre Guillaumin won't do
any harm.

1662
01:58:02,186 --> 01:58:03,335
You really think so?

1663
01:58:06,746 --> 01:58:07,735
My black dress.

1664
01:58:08,026 --> 01:58:09,902
I'll take the back door.

1665
01:58:17,826 --> 01:58:19,019
A thousand cus?

1666
01:58:22,106 --> 01:58:25,415
Why do you need such a sum, my
dear lady?

1667
01:58:26,946 --> 01:58:29,175
You should have consulted me.

1668
01:58:29,826 --> 01:58:33,102
There are a hundred practical
ways...

1669
01:58:33,385 --> 01:58:34,785
of investing.

1670
01:58:37,345 --> 01:58:38,778
Why did you wait?

1671
01:58:41,505 --> 01:58:42,938
I don't know.

1672
01:58:43,385 --> 01:58:44,785
Do I scare you?

1673
01:58:44,906 --> 01:58:46,259
You're usually brave.

1674
01:58:47,986 --> 01:58:51,615
I'm most devoted to you. You do
know that?

1675
01:58:53,665 --> 01:58:55,463
You're a pretty woman...

1676
01:58:55,585 --> 01:58:57,304
the glory of our town.

1677
01:58:57,465 --> 01:59:00,026
I'm most fond of grace and beauty.

1678
01:59:05,385 --> 01:59:06,978
What's your decision?

1679
01:59:07,826 --> 01:59:08,815
What?

1680
01:59:09,545 --> 01:59:11,138
The money?

1681
01:59:16,425 --> 01:59:18,303
You'll get the damn money.

1682
01:59:19,786 --> 01:59:21,777
You're
playing with my despair.

1683
01:59:22,026 --> 01:59:24,255
I'm to be pitied, not bought!

1684
01:59:25,706 --> 01:59:26,775
Stay!

1685
01:59:29,066 --> 01:59:31,375
- Well?
- Nothing. I'm desperate.

1686
01:59:32,106 --> 01:59:34,222
Perhaps there's someone...

1687
01:59:34,465 --> 01:59:36,821
No. There's nobody.

1688
01:59:37,585 --> 01:59:39,894
You said this afternoon perhaps.

1689
01:59:40,066 --> 01:59:41,784
Yes, perhaps...

1690
01:59:41,946 --> 01:59:43,379
The master will soon be in.

1691
01:59:43,625 --> 01:59:44,615
Yes, I know!

1692
01:59:46,106 --> 01:59:48,700
I won't see him. I couldn't stand it!

1693
01:59:48,866 --> 01:59:51,505
I can't forgive him for knowing
me! Never.

1694
01:59:55,545 --> 01:59:58,856
Mother Rolet! Mother Rolet, for
pity's sake!

1695
01:59:59,625 --> 02:00:00,775
I can't breathe!

1696
02:00:03,066 --> 02:00:04,294
I'll unlace you.

1697
02:00:06,665 --> 02:00:07,541
What time is it?

1698
02:00:07,706 --> 02:00:08,775
It'll soon be three.

1699
02:00:12,706 --> 02:00:15,857
The person I'm expecting may be
at my house.

1700
02:00:16,345 --> 02:00:17,495
I can't remember.

1701
02:00:18,545 --> 02:00:20,138
Run and fetch him.

1702
02:00:20,425 --> 02:00:21,335
But the babies...

1703
02:00:21,585 --> 02:00:23,736
I'll look after them. Please hurry.

1704
02:00:23,986 --> 02:00:25,179
I'm going, ma'am.

1705
02:00:25,345 --> 02:00:26,335
I'm going.

1706
02:00:40,505 --> 02:00:41,460
What?

1707
02:00:41,665 --> 02:00:44,304
Nobody. Doctor's crying. Everyone's
looking for you.

1708
02:00:45,305 --> 02:00:46,534
Are you ill?

1709
02:00:54,305 --> 02:00:58,094
Him! He'll save me.

1710
02:01:17,746 --> 02:01:20,817
He's kind, he's thoughtful...

1711
02:01:21,866 --> 02:01:23,059
he's generous.

1712
02:01:28,625 --> 02:01:29,775
Oh! It's you!

1713
02:01:31,266 --> 02:01:32,415
Yes, it's me.

1714
02:01:34,625 --> 02:01:37,424
Rodolphe, I need to ask some
advice.

1715
02:01:40,066 --> 02:01:41,021
Still the same.

1716
02:01:41,266 --> 02:01:42,415
Still as charming.

1717
02:01:42,625 --> 02:01:46,255
They're sad charms, my friend, as
you disdained them.

1718
02:01:46,826 --> 02:01:48,339
No, I'm sure I was right.

1719
02:01:48,545 --> 02:01:51,059
I couldn't lead you off like that.

1720
02:01:51,305 --> 02:01:53,375
No matter. I've suffered.

1721
02:01:54,505 --> 02:01:58,021
So have I, Emma. Such is life.

1722
02:01:58,906 --> 02:02:01,214
Has it been kind to you since we
parted?

1723
02:02:01,706 --> 02:02:03,219
Neither kind nor unkind.

1724
02:02:05,226 --> 02:02:06,863
We shouldn't have parted.

1725
02:02:07,066 --> 02:02:09,135
Yes, perhaps.

1726
02:02:09,505 --> 02:02:10,938
You think so?

1727
02:02:11,066 --> 02:02:13,182
If only you knew! I loved you so!

1728
02:02:13,465 --> 02:02:16,219
How could I part with the
happiness you gave me?

1729
02:02:16,465 --> 02:02:19,741
I almost died of desperation. I'll
tell you about it.

1730
02:02:20,305 --> 02:02:21,625
You fled from me.

1731
02:02:24,305 --> 02:02:26,456
You love other women, admit it!

1732
02:02:27,106 --> 02:02:30,985
I understand. You charmed them
just like me.

1733
02:02:31,625 --> 02:02:34,379
You're a man. You make women
love you.

1734
02:02:36,345 --> 02:02:39,861
We'll start again, won't we? We'll
love again.

1735
02:02:41,146 --> 02:02:42,214
I'm laughing!

1736
02:02:43,266 --> 02:02:44,335
I'm happy!

1737
02:02:48,106 --> 02:02:49,619
Say something!

1738
02:03:08,665 --> 02:03:09,985
You've been crying.

1739
02:03:10,866 --> 02:03:11,821
Why?

1740
02:03:13,465 --> 02:03:17,539
Forgive me. You're the only one I
really like.

1741
02:03:18,146 --> 02:03:20,978
I've been stupid and cruel. I love
you.

1742
02:03:21,425 --> 02:03:23,018
I'll always love you.

1743
02:03:23,266 --> 02:03:24,494
What's wrong? Tell me.

1744
02:03:25,786 --> 02:03:28,902
I'm ruined, Rodolphe. I need 3,000
francs.

1745
02:03:31,746 --> 02:03:34,737
My husband placed his money with
a crooked notary.

1746
02:03:34,946 --> 02:03:37,460
We borrowed because his patients
didn't pay.

1747
02:03:37,665 --> 02:03:40,702
Without 3,000 francs, the bailiffs
will come.

1748
02:03:40,986 --> 02:03:42,544
At this very moment.

1749
02:03:44,585 --> 02:03:47,737
Counting on your friendship, I
came to see you.

1750
02:03:49,625 --> 02:03:50,853
But...

1751
02:03:52,106 --> 02:03:53,585
I don't have it, my dear lady.

1752
02:03:56,425 --> 02:03:57,575
You don't have it?

1753
02:04:00,545 --> 02:04:01,820
You don't have it?

1754
02:04:04,906 --> 02:04:06,259
You don't have it?

1755
02:04:07,625 --> 02:04:09,741
This is my final humiliation.

1756
02:04:10,026 --> 02:04:12,017
You never loved me. You're as bad
as the others.

1757
02:04:13,385 --> 02:04:16,503
Poor people don't buy tortoise-
shell clocks!

1758
02:04:16,746 --> 02:04:19,339
Or watch trinkets! You lack
nothing!

1759
02:04:19,585 --> 02:04:23,214
You have a house and land. You
hunt, you go to Paris!

1760
02:04:23,465 --> 02:04:26,902
This can be turned into money. I
don't want it.

1761
02:04:27,026 --> 02:04:27,936
Keep it!

1762
02:04:29,986 --> 02:04:33,137
I'd have given up everything for
you.

1763
02:04:33,345 --> 02:04:36,781
I'd have begged, just for a smile
and a "thank you".

1764
02:04:37,026 --> 02:04:38,664
Without you, I'd have been happy!

1765
02:04:39,146 --> 02:04:40,977
Why did you do it?

1766
02:04:41,465 --> 02:04:44,856
You even told me right here you
loved me.

1767
02:04:44,986 --> 02:04:48,375
You should have sent me away. My
hands are hot from your kisses.

1768
02:04:48,505 --> 02:04:50,736
You swore love on your knees.

1769
02:04:51,106 --> 02:04:52,824
Two years of dreams!

1770
02:04:52,986 --> 02:04:54,862
Your letter tore my heart apart.

1771
02:04:56,465 --> 02:04:58,696
And I come to the rich, happy, free
man...

1772
02:04:58,946 --> 02:05:00,982
to ask help anybody would give.

1773
02:05:01,226 --> 02:05:03,615
I beg, bring back all my love...

1774
02:05:03,826 --> 02:05:06,259
and he turns me away for 3,000
francs!

1775
02:05:06,906 --> 02:05:08,054
I don't have it.

1776
02:05:29,906 --> 02:05:32,784
If God knows our needs, why
bother praying?

1777
02:05:32,946 --> 02:05:33,822
Be serious.

1778
02:05:34,585 --> 02:05:37,622
I admire Christianity. It freed
slaves...

1779
02:05:37,786 --> 02:05:41,540
created a much-needed moral
order. But the texts!

1780
02:05:41,746 --> 02:05:43,576
All cooked up by Jesuits!

1781
02:05:44,146 --> 02:05:46,057
The key! For the room where...

1782
02:05:46,305 --> 02:05:47,135
What?

1783
02:05:47,746 --> 02:05:50,134
Give it to me. We have rats at
home.

1784
02:05:50,305 --> 02:05:52,103
They're stopping me sleeping.

1785
02:05:52,345 --> 02:05:53,300
I have to ask.

1786
02:05:53,425 --> 02:05:55,223
Don't bother. I'll tell him later.

1787
02:05:55,505 --> 02:05:57,621
Bring some sodium chloride.

1788
02:05:58,866 --> 02:06:00,094
Come on, light the way.

1789
02:06:11,106 --> 02:06:11,982
Stop it!

1790
02:06:13,746 --> 02:06:14,781
Be quiet.

1791
02:06:14,946 --> 02:06:15,776
Why?

1792
02:06:16,066 --> 02:06:18,295
Don't say anything. To anyone.

1793
02:06:19,186 --> 02:06:20,539
They'd blame your master.

1794
02:06:41,625 --> 02:06:42,581
Thank God, you're here!

1795
02:06:42,826 --> 02:06:45,294
What's going on? What's happening
to us?

1796
02:06:46,226 --> 02:06:47,260
Why?

1797
02:06:54,786 --> 02:06:55,934
Tell me!

1798
02:07:03,146 --> 02:07:04,295
You'll read it tomorrow.

1799
02:07:06,226 --> 02:07:08,693
For now, I beg you, don't ask me a
single question.

1800
02:07:11,106 --> 02:07:12,255
I beg you, leave me.

1801
02:07:32,026 --> 02:07:33,539
My death isn't much.

1802
02:07:36,026 --> 02:07:37,141
I'll fall asleep...

1803
02:07:38,786 --> 02:07:40,014
and it will be over.

1804
02:07:47,345 --> 02:07:48,620
I'm thirsty!

1805
02:07:49,345 --> 02:07:50,778
I'm so thirsty!

1806
02:07:52,786 --> 02:07:54,583
- What's wrong?
- It's nothing.

1807
02:07:58,786 --> 02:07:59,696
More!

1808
02:08:00,585 --> 02:08:02,065
Open the window, I'm stifling.

1809
02:08:07,906 --> 02:08:10,784
It's extraordinary. It looks like
white gravel.

1810
02:08:10,946 --> 02:08:12,584
No! You're mistaken!

1811
02:08:31,026 --> 02:08:32,219
I'm cold.

1812
02:08:36,986 --> 02:08:38,214
I'm cold.

1813
02:08:49,146 --> 02:08:51,340
I feel better. I'll get up later.

1814
02:08:54,746 --> 02:08:56,019
It's unbearable!

1815
02:08:58,946 --> 02:09:01,414
Tell me! What did you eat?

1816
02:09:01,706 --> 02:09:02,695
Answer me...

1817
02:09:02,906 --> 02:09:03,894
for God's sake!

1818
02:09:04,106 --> 02:09:05,016
There...

1819
02:09:15,186 --> 02:09:17,620
"Let no one be accused... " Oh, God!

1820
02:09:21,786 --> 02:09:22,661
Poisoned!

1821
02:09:25,826 --> 02:09:26,815
Poisoned!

1822
02:09:28,186 --> 02:09:29,460
Help!

1823
02:09:32,146 --> 02:09:35,501
Calm down. We just need to give
her a strong antidote.

1824
02:09:35,706 --> 02:09:36,900
What's the poison?

1825
02:09:37,106 --> 02:09:38,585
Arsenic!

1826
02:09:38,746 --> 02:09:40,179
We need an analysis.

1827
02:09:40,425 --> 02:09:43,497
Do it, just do it. Save her.

1828
02:10:01,505 --> 02:10:02,700
Don't cry.

1829
02:10:04,585 --> 02:10:06,496
Soon I won't torment you any
more.

1830
02:10:07,266 --> 02:10:08,300
But why?

1831
02:10:09,946 --> 02:10:11,094
Who made you do it?

1832
02:10:12,266 --> 02:10:13,778
I had to do it, dear.

1833
02:10:17,066 --> 02:10:18,862
Weren't you happy with me?

1834
02:10:20,505 --> 02:10:21,825
Is it my fault?

1835
02:10:24,986 --> 02:10:26,499
I did everything I could.

1836
02:10:29,226 --> 02:10:30,978
That's true. You're a good man.

1837
02:10:34,146 --> 02:10:36,740
She hoped she was finished with
the treachery...

1838
02:10:36,986 --> 02:10:40,500
wickedness and consuming greed
that tortured her.

1839
02:10:40,665 --> 02:10:42,496
She hated no one, now.

1840
02:10:42,706 --> 02:10:45,742
Twilight descended over her
mind...

1841
02:10:45,986 --> 02:10:48,375
and, of all the earth's noises,
she heard only...

1842
02:10:48,545 --> 02:10:51,504
the intermittent sobbing of her
poor love...

1843
02:10:51,746 --> 02:10:55,340
as soft and faint as the last
echo of a symphony...

1844
02:10:55,505 --> 02:10:56,540
fading away.

1845
02:11:03,146 --> 02:11:04,898
Bring me Berthe.

1846
02:11:05,106 --> 02:11:06,619
You're not feeling worse?

1847
02:11:17,305 --> 02:11:20,183
How pale you are! You're sweating!

1848
02:11:21,226 --> 02:11:22,420
I'm scared.

1849
02:11:30,746 --> 02:11:31,576
That's enough!

1850
02:13:09,345 --> 02:13:12,861
It was blowing so strong that
day...

1851
02:13:13,026 --> 02:13:14,697
that it blew her petticoats...

1852
02:13:14,986 --> 02:13:16,214
far away.

1853
02:13:16,465 --> 02:13:17,375
The blind man!

1854
02:13:33,585 --> 02:13:35,736
Farewell! Farewell!

1855
02:13:42,345 --> 02:13:43,745
Pray, my son.

1856
02:13:45,986 --> 02:13:47,304
But I'm suffering!

1857
02:13:48,106 --> 02:13:50,222
God is great!

1858
02:13:50,345 --> 02:13:52,143
We must accept His will.

1859
02:13:54,026 --> 02:13:56,699
I hate your God!

1860
02:13:57,226 --> 02:13:59,342
The spirit of rebellion is still
within you.

1861
02:14:20,385 --> 02:14:22,342
Fate's the one to blame.

1862
02:14:29,465 --> 02:14:32,503
One evening, Berthe came to
fetch him for dinner.

1863
02:14:32,746 --> 02:14:36,260
He was sitting under the arbour.
She gently pushed him.

1864
02:14:36,425 --> 02:14:38,336
He fell to the ground. He was
dead.

1865
02:14:38,585 --> 02:14:41,896
12 francs and 75 centimes were
left after sale...

1866
02:14:42,066 --> 02:14:45,615
and that paid for Berthe's trip to
her grandmother's.

1867
02:14:45,826 --> 02:14:47,656
The old lady died that year.

1868
02:14:47,906 --> 02:14:51,215
Old Rouault being paralysed, an
aunt took her in.

1869
02:14:51,505 --> 02:14:54,019
She is poor and has sent her to
work...

1870
02:14:54,305 --> 02:14:55,340
in a cotton mill.

1871
02:14:55,585 --> 02:14:57,861
Homais'practice grows like
wildfire.

1872
02:14:58,106 --> 02:15:01,223
Authority respects him and
public opinion protects him.

1873
02:15:01,425 --> 02:15:03,496
He has just received the Legion
of Honour.
