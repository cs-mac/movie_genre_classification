HAMLET

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,879
Based on the tragedy by
SHAKESPEARE

4
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,478
Part Two

5
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,714
Mother!

6
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,393
My lady!

7
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,832
Tell him your Grace has stood between
Much heat and him.

8
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,629
I'll sconce me even here.
Pray you, be round with him.

9
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,638
Now, mother, what's the matter?

10
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,276
Hamlet, thou have thy father much
offended.

11
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,712
Mother, you have my father much
offended.

12
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,350
- You answer with an idle tongue.
- You question with a wicked tongue.

13
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,198
Why, how now, Hamlet?

14
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,953
- What's the matter now?
- Have you forgot me?

15
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,872
No, by the rood, not so.

16
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,751
You're the queen, your husband's
brother's wife, and, alas, my mother.

17
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,270
Nay, then, I'll set those to you that
can speak.

18
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,589
Come, come!

19
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,356
And sit you down.

20
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,434
You shall not budge.

21
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,552
You go not till I set you up a glass
Where you may see your inmost part.

22
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,514
What will thou do?

23
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,675
Thou will not murder me?

24
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,709
- Help, help, ho!
- What, ho! Help, help, help!

25
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,796
How now! A rat?

26
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,230
Dead for a ducat!

27
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,835
Dead!

28
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,673
- O me, what have thou done?
- Nay, I know not. Is it the king?

29
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,672
O, what a rash and bloody deed is
this!

30
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,833
Almost as bad, good mother,
As kill a king and marry his brother.

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,672
As kill a king?

32
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,715
Ay, lady, 'twas my word.

33
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,959
Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool,
farewell!

34
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,112
I took thee for thy better.

35
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,954
Thou find'st to be too busy is some
danger.

36
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,310
Leave wringing of your hands. Sit you
down.

37
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,953
And let me wring your heart,
If it be made of penetrable stuff,

38
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,078
If damned custom have not brazed it so
That it is proof against sense.

39
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,954
What have I done that thou are
So rude against me?

40
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,712
Such an act that...

41
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,475
Look here, upon this picture...

42
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,635
...and on this.

43
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,595
The counterfeit presentment
of two brothers.

44
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,310
See, what a grace was seated on this
brow,

45
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,309
A combination and a form indeed,
Where every god did set his seal,

46
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,557
To give the world assurance of a man.

47
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,673
This was your husband. Look you now,

48
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,993
What follows. Here is your husband,

49
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,388
Like a mildewed ear,

50
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,993
Blasting his wholesome brother.

51
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,194
Have you eyes?
You cannot call it love.

52
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,549
For at your age the heyday in the
blood waits upon the judgement.

53
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,834
And whatjudgement
Would step from this to this?

54
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,477
O shame! Where is thy blush?

55
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,991
If you canst mutine in a matron's bones,
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,

56
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,156
And melt in her own fire!

57
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,753
O Hamlet, speak no more!

58
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,710
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very
soul,

59
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,673
And there I see such black spots
As will not leave their tinct.

60
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,559
Nay, but to live
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,

61
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,870
Stewed in corruption, honeying
Over the nasty sty...

62
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,314
O, speak to me no more!

63
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,154
These words, like daggers,
Enter in mine ears.

64
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,998
...A murderer and a villain,

65
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,868
A slave that is not twentieth part
The tithe of your precedent lord.

66
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,634
A vice of kings,
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule.

67
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,114
Hamlet, no more!

68
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,838
How is it with you?
Whereon do you look?

69
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,596
This is the very coinage of your brain.

70
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,830
My pulse, as yours, does temperately
keep time.

71
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,958
It is not madness that I have
Uttered. Bring me to the test,

72
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,113
And I the matter will re-word, which
Madness would gambol from.

73
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,312
Lay not that flattering unction to
soul,

74
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,277
That not your trespass, but my madness
speaks.

75
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,233
It will but skin and film the ulcer,
Whilst rank corruption infects unseen.

76
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,273
O Hamlet, thou have cleft my heart
in twain!

77
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,196
O, throw away the worser part of it,
And live the purer with the other half.

78
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,674
Good night.

79
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,953
But go not to my uncle's bed.

80
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,472
For this same lord,

81
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,238
I do repent.

82
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,993
I'll bestow him, and will answer well
The death I gave him.

83
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,998
So, again, good night.

84
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,673
I must be cruel, only to be kind.

85
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,154
Thus bad begins, and worse remains
behind.

86
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,715
One word more, good lady.

87
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,553
What shall I do?

88
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,193
Not this, by no means, that I bid
you do.

89
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,989
Let the bloat king tempt you again
to bed,

90
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,830
And let him, for a pair of reechy
kisses,

91
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,756
Make you to ravel all this matter out,
That I essentially am not in madness,

92
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,957
But mad in craft.

93
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,469
Be thou assured, I have no life
to breathe

94
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,431
What thou have said to me.

95
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,509
- I must to England, you know that?
- Alack.

96
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,553
I had forgot. 'Tis so concluded on.

97
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,108
Good night, mother!

98
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,279
My lord!

99
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,589
My lord!

100
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,959
Lord Hamlet!

101
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,350
What noise?
Who calls on Hamlet?

102
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,394
What have you done, my lord,
with the dead body?

103
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,594
Compounded it with dust, whereto
'tis kin.

104
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,509
Tell us where 'tis, that we may bear
it to the chapel.

105
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,394
- Do not believe it.
- Believe what?

106
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,236
That I can keep your counsel,
and not my own.

107
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,515
Besides, to be demanded
of a sponge!

108
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,438
What replication should be made
by the son of a king?

109
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,159
Take you me for a sponge?

110
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,438
Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's
countenance, his rewards.

111
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,517
But such officers do the king
best services in the end.

112
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,156
He keeps them, like an ape,
in the corner of his jaw,

113
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,676
first mouthed,
to be last swallowed.

114
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,957
When he needs what you have
gleaned, it is but squeezing you,

115
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,470
and, sponge, you shall be dry again.

116
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,837
I understand you not, my lord.

117
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,310
I am glad of it. A knavish speech
sleeps in a foolish ear.

118
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,279
My lord, you must tell us where the
body is, and go with us to the king.

119
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,718
The body is with the king,
but the king is not with the body.

120
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,111
The king is a thing...

121
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,397
- A thing, my lord?
- Of nothing.

122
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,713
Hide fox,
and all after!

123
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,438
Bring me to him.

124
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,078
Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?

125
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,355
At supper.

126
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,914
At supper?

127
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,994
Where?

128
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,840
Not where he eats,
but where he is eaten.

129
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,793
A certain convocation of politic
worms are e'en at him.

130
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,750
Your worm is your only
emperor for diet.

131
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,352
We fat all creatures else
to fat us,

132
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,029
and we fat ourselves
for maggots.

133
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,077
Your fat king
and your lean beggar

134
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,829
is but variable service... two dishes,
but to one table.

135
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,991
That's the end.

136
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,078
Alas, alas!

137
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,237
A man may fish with the worm

138
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,837
that has eat of a king,

139
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,590
and eat of the fish
that has fed of that worm.

140
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,719
What dost thou mean by this?

141
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,639
Nothing but to show you

142
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,431
how a king may go a progress
through the guts of a beggar.

143
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,396
Where is Polonius?

144
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,314
In heaven.
Send thither to see.

145
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,473
If your messenger find him not,
seek him in the other place yourself.

146
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,637
But if you find him not within this
month,

147
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,791
you shall nose him as you go up
the stairs into the lobby.

148
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,552
Go seek him there.

149
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,798
He will stay till ye come.

150
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,192
Hamlet, this deed,
For thine especial safety,

151
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,191
Must send thee
With fiery quickness.

152
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,391
Therefore prepare thyself. The bark
is ready.

153
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,949
And the wind at help, and every thing
Is bent for England.

154
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,678
- For England?
- Ay, Hamlet.

155
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,716
Good.

156
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,357
But, come, for England!

157
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,278
Farewell, dear mother.

158
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,273
- Thy loving father, Hamlet.
- My mother.

159
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,792
Father and mother is man and wife,
man and wife is one flesh.

160
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,679
And so, my mother.

161
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,955
Come!

162
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,469
For England!

163
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,510
Go, captain, from me greet the Danish
king.

164
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,470
Tell him that Fortinbras claims the
conveyance of a march over his kingdom.

165
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,670
You know the rendezvous.

166
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,516
If that his majesty
Would aught with us,

167
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,875
We shall express our duty in his eye.

168
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,439
Go softly on.

169
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,109
- Whose powers are these?
- They are of Norway.

170
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,599
- How purposed?
- Against some part of Poland.

171
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,638
- Who commands them?
- Lord Fortinbras.

172
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,353
Goes it against the main of Poland,
Or for some frontier?

173
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:30,553
Truly to speak,
We go to gain a little patch of ground

174
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,797
That has in it no profit but the name.

175
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,879
To pay five ducats, five,
I would not farm it, nor

176
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,033
Will it yield to Norway or the Pole
A ranker rate, should it be sold.

177
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,792
Why, then, the Polack never will
defend it.

178
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,076
Yes, it is already garrisoned.

179
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,711
- I humbly thank you, sir.
- God be with you, sir.

180
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,752
Will't please you go, my lord?

181
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,796
I'll be with you straight. Go a little
before.

182
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,596
Two thousand souls
and twenty thousand ducats

183
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,314
Will not debate the question of this
straw!

184
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,748
This is the imposthume of much
wealth and peace,

185
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,314
That inward breaks, and shows no
cause without

186
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,709
Why the man dies.

187
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,869
Farewell...

188
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,795
Farewell...

189
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,151
And do remember me!

190
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,278
Upon arrival in England,

191
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,031
Lord Hamlet
is to be beheaded.

192
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,232
Let it work,

193
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,075
For 'tis the sport to have the engineer
Hoist with his own petar.

194
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,354
But I will delve

195
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,028
one yard below their mines,

196
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,039
And blow them at the moon!

197
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,988
O, 'tis most sweet when in one line
Two crafts directly meet.

198
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,154
On the view and knowing of these
contents,

199
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,720
The bearers should be put to sudden
death,

200
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,597
Not shriving-time allowed.

201
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,629
When sorrows come, they come not
single spies, but in battalions.

202
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,633
First, her father slain.

203
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,870
Next, your son gone,
And he most violent author

204
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,598
Of his own just remove.

205
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,588
The people muddied,

206
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,196
Thick and unwholesome in their
thoughts and whispers,

207
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,670
For good Polonius' death.

208
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,075
Where is the beauteous majesty of
Denmark?

209
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,518
How now, Ophelia?

210
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:36,272
How should I your true-Iove know

211
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,117
From another one?

212
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,837
By his cockle hat and staff,

213
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,073
And his sandal shoon.

214
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,432
- Sweet lady, what imports this song?
- Say you? Nay.

215
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,952
Pray you, mark.

216
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:03,480
Larded with sweet flowers,

217
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,191
Which bewept

218
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,509
to the grave did go

219
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,551
With true love showers.

220
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,475
How do you, pretty lady?

221
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,352
I hope all will be well.

222
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,392
We must be patient.

223
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,113
But I cannot choose but weep,

224
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,840
to think they should lay him
in the cold ground.

225
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,992
My brother shall know of it.

226
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,916
And so I thank you for your good
counsel.

227
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,558
Come, my coach!

228
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,552
Good night, ladies.

229
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,512
Good night, sweet ladies.

230
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,478
Tomorrow is Saint Valentine's day,

231
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,150
All in the morning betime,

232
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,393
And I a maid at your window,

233
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,235
To be your Valentine.

234
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,077
Then up he rose, and donned his
clothes,

235
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,709
And dupt the chamber-door,

236
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,958
Let in the maid, that out a maid

237
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,750
Never departed more.

238
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,595
Save yourself, my lord!
The rioters!

239
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,237
Sirs, stand you all without.
I pray you, give me leave.

240
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,236
I thank you. Keep the door.

241
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,915
O thou vile king,
Where is my father?

242
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,471
- Dead.
- But not by him.

243
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,153
Let him demand his fill.

244
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,913
There's such divinity does hedge
a king,

245
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,669
That treason can but peep to what
it would,

246
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,872
Acts little of his will.

247
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,115
How came he dead?

248
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,432
Good Laertes, if you desire to know
the certainty

249
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,314
Of your dear father's death,
is't writ in your revenge,

250
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,315
That, swoopstake, you will draw

251
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,916
Both friend and foe,
Winner and loser?

252
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,116
- None but his enemies.
- Will you know them, then?

253
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,192
Ay, and to his good friends thus wide
I'll ope my arms.

254
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,273
Why, now you speak
Like a good child and a true gentleman.

255
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,238
That I am guiltless of your father's
death,

256
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,914
And am most sensibly in grief for it,
It shall to you be clear as a day.

257
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,593
Let her come in!

258
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,436
They bore him barefaced on the bier,

259
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,392
Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny,

260
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,596
And in his grave rained many a tear,

261
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,552
Fare you well, my dove!

262
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,473
You must sing,

263
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,357
"Down a-down,

264
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,757
an you call him a-down-a."

265
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,354
It is the false steward,
that stole his master's daughter.

266
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,073
Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade
revenge, it could not move thus.

267
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,759
There's rosemary.

268
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:50,159
That's for remembrance,
pray you, love, remember.

269
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,549
And there is pansies,
that's for thoughts.

270
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,439
There's a daisy.

271
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,714
And here's some for me.

272
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:24,113
O, you must wear your rue
with a difference.

273
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,796
I would give you some violets,

274
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,953
but they withered all
when my father died.

275
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,270
They say he made a good end.

276
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,000
For bonny sweet Robin,

277
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,313
For bonny sweet Robin

278
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,318
is all my joy...

279
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,797
Do you see this, O God?

280
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,515
Laertes,

281
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,037
I must commune with your grief,
Or you deny me right.

282
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,399
Make choice of whom your wisest
friends you will,

283
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,915
And they shall hear and judge
'twixt you and me.

284
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:30,113
And we shall jointly labour with
Your soul to give it due content.

285
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,873
Let this be so.

286
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,668
Since you have heard,

287
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,558
That he which has your father slain
Pursued my life.

288
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,549
It well appears.

289
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,676
Why you proceeded not against these
feats,

290
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,432
So crimeful and so capital in nature?

291
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,154
The queen his mother
Lives almost by his looks.

292
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,314
The other motive,
Why to a public count I might not go,

293
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,388
Is the great love the general gender
bear him.

294
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,150
- How now! What news?
- Letters, my lord, from Hamlet.

295
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,914
From Hamlet?

296
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,319
- Who brought them?
- Sailors, my lord, they say.

297
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,992
Laertes,
you shall hear them.

298
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,995
Leave us.

299
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:40,197
High and mighty,
You shall know I am

300
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,637
set naked
on your kingdom.

301
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,839
Can you advise me?

302
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,314
I'm lost in it, my lord.

303
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,272
But let him come.

304
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,752
Will you be ruled by me?

305
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,194
My lord, I will be ruled.

306
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,075
Horatio!

307
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,870
Thou art e'en as just a man
As e'er my conversation coped withal.

308
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,314
O, my dear lord...

309
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,590
Nay, do not think I flatter.

310
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,877
No, let the candied tongue lick
absurd pomp.

311
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,308
In youth, when I did love, did love,

312
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,710
Methought it was very sweet,

313
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,475
To contract, O, the time, for, ah,
my behove,

314
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,830
O, methought there was nothing meet.

315
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,879
But age, with his stealing steps,

316
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,071
Has clawed me in his clutch,

317
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,675
And has shipt me intil the land,

318
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,354
As if I had never been such.

319
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,794
That skull had a tongue in it,

320
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,076
and could sing once.

321
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,118
How the knave jowls it to the ground,

322
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,113
as if it were Cain's jaw-bone,
that did the first murder!

323
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,718
It might be the pate of a politician,
which this ass now over-reaches,

324
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:57,153
one that would circumvent God,
might it not?

325
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,673
It might, my lord.

326
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,315
Why...

327
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,635
Even so.

328
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,951
And now my Lady Worm's,

329
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:11,478
chapless, and knockt about the mazard
with a sexton's spade.

330
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,835
Here's fine revolution!

331
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,398
And we had the trick to see it.

332
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,753
Did these bones cost no more,
but to play at loggats with 'em?

333
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,795
Mine ache to think on it.

334
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,032
I will speak to this fellow.

335
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,357
O, a pit of clay for to be made

336
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,317
For such a guest is meet.

337
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,711
- Whose grave's this, sirrah?
- Mine, sir.

338
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,156
I think it be thine, indeed,
for thou liest in it.

339
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:54,035
'Tis a quick lie, sir. 'Twill away
again, from me to you.

340
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,271
What man dost thou dig it for?

341
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,759
For no man, sir.

342
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,514
- What woman, then?
- For none, neither.

343
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,874
Who is to be buried in it?

344
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,190
One that was a woman, sir,

345
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,273
but, rest her soul,
she's dead.

346
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,070
How absolute the knave is!

347
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,671
We must speak by the card,

348
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,353
or equivocation will undo us.

349
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,519
How long have thou been a grave-
maker?

350
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:22,798
Of all the days in the year, it was
the day that young Hamlet was born.

351
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:26,516
He that is mad,
and sent into England.

352
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,155
Ay, marry,
why was he sent into England?

353
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,034
Why, because
a' was mad.

354
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,318
A' shall recover his wits there.

355
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,120
Or, if a' do not,
'tis no great matter there.

356
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,675
Why?

357
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:42,072
'Twill not be seen in him there.
There the men are as mad as he.

358
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,072
How came he mad?

359
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,678
Very strangely, they say.

360
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,109
How strangely?

361
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,874
Faith, even with losing his wits.

362
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,113
Upon what ground?

363
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,154
Why,
here in Denmark.

364
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,638
How long will a man lie
in the earth ere he rot?

365
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,633
I'faith...

366
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,395
If a' be not rotten before a' die, -

367
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,349
we have many pocky corpses now
that will scarce hold the laying in, -

368
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,358
a' will last some eight or nine year.

369
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,830
A tanner will last you nine year.

370
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,559
Why he more than another?

371
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,076
Why, sir, his hide is so tanned
with his trade

372
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,958
that a' will keep out water a great
while.

373
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,315
And your water
is a sore decayer

374
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,914
of your whoreson
dead body.

375
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,311
Here's a skull now has lain you

376
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,995
in the earth three-and-twenty years.

377
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,556
- Whose was it?
- A whoreson mad fellow's it was.

378
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,791
- Whose do you think it was?
- Nay, I know not.

379
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,835
A pestilence on him
for a mad rogue!

380
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,835
A' poured a flagon of Rhenish
on my head once.

381
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,797
This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
skull,

382
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,437
the king's jester.

383
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:10,875
This?

384
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,399
E'en that.

385
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,069
Let me see.

386
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,153
Alas, poor Yorick!

387
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,872
I knew him, Horatio.

388
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,636
A fellow of infinite jest,
of most excellent fancy.

389
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,190
He has borne me on his back
a thousand times.

390
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,832
And now, how abhorred in my
imagination it is! My gorge rises at it.

391
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,516
Here hung those lips

392
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,795
that I have kissed
I know not how oft.

393
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,632
Where be your gibes now? Your
gambols? Your flashes of merriment?

394
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:10,269
Not one now,
to mock your own grinning?

395
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,232
Quite chop-faln?

396
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,432
- Horatio, tell me one thing.
- What's that, my lord?

397
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,792
Dost thou think Alexander looked
o' this fashion in the earth?

398
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:26,949
E'en so.

399
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,233
To what base uses
we may return, Horatio!

400
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,156
Why may not
imagination trace

401
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,875
the noble dust of Alexander

402
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,475
till he find it
stopping a bung-hole?

403
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,593
'Twere to consider too curiously,
to consider so.

404
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,873
No, faith, not a jot.

405
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,958
But to follow him thither
with modesty enough,

406
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,390
and likelihood to lead it,
as thus:

407
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:57,357
Alexander died,
Alexander was buried,

408
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,356
Alexander returneth into dust,
the dust is earth,

409
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,958
of earth we make loam.

410
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,551
Why of that loam whereto he was turned
might they not stop a beer-barrel?

411
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,996
Imperious Caesar, turned to clay,
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.

412
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,349
O, that that earth which kept
the world in awe

413
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,997
Should patch a wall t'expel
the winter's flaw!

414
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,032
What ceremony else?

415
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:16,318
Her obsequies have been as far enlarged
As we have warranties.

416
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,269
Her death was doubtful. And, but the
great command oversways the order,

417
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,472
She should in ground unsanctified
have lodged

418
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,272
Till the last trumpet.

419
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:30,399
For charitable prayers, shards, flints
And pebbles should be thrown on her.

420
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,757
Must there no more be done?

421
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,912
No more be done.
We should profane the service

422
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,753
To sing a requiem, and such rest
To her, as to peace-parted souls.

423
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,194
Lay her in the earth!

424
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,676
A ministering angel shall my sister be,
When thou liest howling.

425
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:48,992
O, treble woe fall ten times treble
On that cursed head

426
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,799
Whose wicked deed thy ingenious
sense deprived thee of!

427
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:55,589
Hold off the earth awhile,
Till I have caught her in mine arms.

428
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,716
Now pile your dust upon the quick and
dead,

429
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,996
Till of this flat a mountain you have
made

430
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,754
To overtop old Pelion
And blue Olympus.

431
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,672
What is he whose grief
Bears such an emphasis?

432
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,592
This is I, Hamlet the Dane.

433
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,478
The devil take thy soul!

434
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,792
Thou pray not well. Off my throat.
Hold off thy hand!

435
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:13,836
Gentlemen!

436
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,752
- Pluck them asunder!
- Hamlet!

437
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,629
Good my lord, be quiet!

438
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,109
Why, I will fight with him
upon this theme

439
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,679
Until my eyelids will no longer wag.

440
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,308
- O my son, what theme?
- I loved Ophelia.

441
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:28,235
Forty thousand brothers could not,
With all their love, make up my sum.

442
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,676
What wilt thou do for her?

443
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,678
- O, he is mad, Laertes.
- For love of God, forbear him.

444
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,030
'Swounds, show me what thou'It do.

445
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,717
Woo't weep? Woo't fight? Woo't fast?

446
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:42,108
Woo't tear thyself? Woo't drink up
eisel? Eat a crocodile?

447
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,393
I'll do it.

448
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,152
Dost thou come here to whine? To
outface me with leaping in her grave?

449
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,230
Be buried quick with her? And so
will I.

450
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,954
And if thou prate of mountains, let
them throw millions of acres on us,

451
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,998
Till our ground, singeing his pate
against the burning zone!

452
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,918
Nay, an thou'It mouth,

453
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,958
I'll rant as well as thou.

454
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:20,833
Laertes, what is the reason that you
use me thus?

455
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,675
I loved you ever.

456
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,153
But it is no matter...

457
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,999
Let Hercules himself do what he may,

458
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,628
The cat will mew, and dog will have
his day.

459
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,590
You have been talked of much,
And that in Hamlet's hearing,

460
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,910
For a quality wherein you shine.

461
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,190
Your sum of parts did not together
pluck such envy from him,

462
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,357
As did a very riband one,
Your art and exercise in your defence.

463
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,034
Now, out of this...

464
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,716
What out of this, my lord?

465
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,559
Bring you together and wager on your
heads.

466
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,354
He, being remiss,

467
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,634
Most generous, and free from all
contriving,

468
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,394
Will not peruse the foils, so that,
with ease,

469
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,154
Or with a little shuffling, you may
choose

470
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,198
A sword unbated, and, in a pass of
practice,

471
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,392
Requite him for your father.

472
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:44,630
I will do it.

473
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:47,596
And for that purpose I'll anoint my
sword.

474
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,674
And that he calls for drink,

475
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,153
I'll have prepared him a chalice
for the nonce,

476
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,633
whereon but sipping,

477
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,868
Our purpose may hold there.

478
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,639
But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
That to Laertes I forgot myself,

479
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,230
For, by the image of my cause, I see
The portraiture of his.

480
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,515
I'll court his favours.

481
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,440
But, sure, the bravery of his grief
did put me

482
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,589
In a towering passion.

483
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,189
Your lordship is right welcome
back to Denmark.

484
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,752
I humbly thank you, sir.

485
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,190
- Dost know this water-fly?
- No, my good lord.

486
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:08,470
If your lordship were at leisure, I'd
impart a thing to you from his majesty.

487
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,358
I will receive it with all diligence
of spirit.

488
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,750
Put your bonnet to his right use.
'Tis for the head.

489
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,514
I thank your lordship.
It is very hot.

490
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,591
No, 'tis very cold, the wind is
northerly.

491
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,752
It is indifferent cold,
my lord, indeed.

492
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:24,711
His majesty bade me
signify to you,

493
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,518
that he has laid a wager on your head.

494
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,159
What did he wager?

495
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,476
Here is newly come to court Laertes,

496
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,750
an absolute gentleman,
full of most excellent differences...

497
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:34,751
What imports the nomination of this
gentleman?

498
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,115
- Of Laertes?
- Of him, sir.

499
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,558
I mean, for his weapon.

500
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,592
In his meed he's unfellowed.

501
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,478
- What's his weapon?
- Rapier and dagger.

502
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,868
That's two of his weapons.

503
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,840
The king has laid, that in a dozen
passes between yourself and him,

504
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,799
Laertes shall not exceed you
three hits.

505
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,509
It would come to immediate trial,
if you would vouchsafe the answer.

506
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,592
How if I answer no?

507
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:05,030
I mean, my lord, the opposition
of your person in trial.

508
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:13,154
I will walk here in the hall.
Let the foils be brought.

509
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:16,114
Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?

510
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,068
To this effect, sir, after what
flourish your nature will.

511
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:23,028
I commend my duty
to your lordship.

512
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,038
Yours, yours.

513
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,432
You will lose this wager, my lord.

514
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,716
I do not think so. I shall win.

515
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:37,398
But thou wouldst not think how ill
I feel my heart. But it is no matter.

516
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,596
- Nay, good my lord!
- It is but foolery.

517
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,354
But it is such a kind of gain-giving
as would perhaps trouble a woman.

518
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,317
I'll say you are not fit.

519
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,153
Not a whit.
We defy augury.

520
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,556
If it be now,

521
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,592
'tis not to come.

522
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:54,348
If it be not now,
yet it will come.

523
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:56,352
The readiness is all.

524
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,312
Since no man knows aught
of what he leaves,

525
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,118
what is't to leave betimes?

526
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,679
Let be.

527
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,111
Give me your pardon, sir.
I've done you wrong.

528
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,998
This presence knows,
And you must needs have heard,

529
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,709
How I am punished
With sore distraction.

530
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,350
What I have done, what might
Your nature, honour, and exception

531
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,515
Roughly awake, I here proclaim was
madness.

532
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,597
If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
And does he wrong Laertes,

533
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:31,516
Then Hamlet does it not,
Hamlet denies it.

534
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,189
Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
free me,

535
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:42,231
That I have shot mine arrow o'er
The house, and hurt my brother.

536
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,313
I am satisfied in nature,

537
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:50,709
Whose motive, in this case, should
stir me most to my revenge.

538
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,312
But in my terms of honour
I stand aloof,

539
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:57,275
And will no reconcilement
Till by some elder masters,

540
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:00,153
I have a voice and precedent of peace,
To keep my name ungored.

541
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:04,110
But till that time I do receive your
Offered love, and will not wrong it.

542
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:07,272
I embrace it freely,
And will this brother's wager play.

543
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,352
Give us the foils. Come on.

544
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:13,036
Give them the foils, young Osric.
Hamlet, you know the wager?

545
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,470
Very well, my lord. Your Grace
has laid the odds o'th'weaker side.

546
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,471
I do not fear it. I have seen you both.

547
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,632
I'll be your foil. In mine ignorance

548
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,798
Your skill shall, like a star in the
darkest night, stick fiery off indeed.

549
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:23,915
You mock me, sir.

550
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:26,350
No, by this hand.

551
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,035
Set me the stoops of wine upon that
table.

552
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,998
If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
Or quit i'answer of the third exchange,

553
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,310
Let all the battlements their ordnance
fire.

554
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,511
The king shall drink to Hamlet's
better breath,

555
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,874
And in the cup an union shall he
throw,

556
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:44,709
Richer than that which four successive
kings in Denmark's crown have worn.

557
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:46,235
Come, begin.

558
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,309
Come on, sir.

559
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,355
Come, my lord.

560
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,674
- One!
- No!

561
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:30,756
Judgement!

562
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,831
- A hit, a very palpable hit.
- Well, again.

563
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,110
One!

564
00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:00,717
Stay, give me drink.
Hamlet, here's to thy health!

565
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,273
This pearl is thine.

566
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,553
Here's your cup.

567
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:17,714
I'll play this bout first.

568
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:22,555
Set it by awhile.

569
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,355
Come.

570
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,316
- Another hit, what say you?
- A touch, a touch, I do confess.

571
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,113
Our son shall win.

572
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,190
He's fat, and scant of breath.

573
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:03,237
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin.
Rub thy brows.

574
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:14,159
The queen carouses to thy fortune.

575
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,350
Good madam!

576
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,112
Gertrude, do not drink.

577
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,396
I will, my lord. I pray you, pardon me.

578
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:34,031
Come, Laertes, you but dally.
I pray, pass with your best violence.

579
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:35,958
I am afeared you make a wanton of me.

580
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,475
Say you so? Come on.

581
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,034
Have at you now!

582
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,231
Part them! They are incensed.

583
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:04,874
Nay, come, again.

584
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,471
Look to the queen there, ho!

585
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:32,110
- How does the queen?
- She swounds to see them bleed.

586
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:37,396
No, no, Hamlet!
The drink, the drink! ...I am poisoned!

587
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,558
O villainy! Treachery!

588
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,874
- Seek it out!
- It is here, Hamlet.

589
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,715
Thou art slain. No medicine
in the world can do thee good.

590
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:52,078
In thee not half an hour of life.
The foil unbated and envenomed.

591
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:55,914
The king, the king's to blame!

592
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,154
The point envenomed too?

593
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:05,192
Then, venom,
to thy work!

594
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,834
The rest is silence.

595
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:03,350
- Where is this sight?
- What is it ye would see?

596
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:07,513
If aught of woe or wonder, cease
your search.

597
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:27,150
Let four captains bear
Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage.

598
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:31,429
For he was likely, had he been put on,
To have proved most royally.

599
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:33,314
And, for his passage,

600
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:37,758
The soldiers' music and the rites
Of war speak loudly for him.

601
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,153
Take up the bodies.

602
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:45,111
Such a sight as this becomes the field,
But here shows much amiss.

603
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,238
Go, bid the soldiers shoot!

604
01:10:57,160 --> 01:11:00,994
The End
