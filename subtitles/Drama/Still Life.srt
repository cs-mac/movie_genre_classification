1
00:00:45,432 --> 00:00:47,967
<i>That saved a wretch</i>

2
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,269
<i>Like me</i>

3
00:00:54,407 --> 00:00:57,410
<i>I once</i>

4
00:00:57,444 --> 00:01:00,613
<i>Was lost</i>

5
00:01:00,647 --> 00:01:03,783
<i>But now</i>

6
00:01:03,816 --> 00:01:06,085
<i>I'm found</i>

7
00:01:56,503 --> 00:01:57,704
Thank you, Father.

8
00:01:57,737 --> 00:01:59,572
See you soon, Mr. May.

9
00:02:04,443 --> 00:02:06,846
Loved the music, Mr. May.

10
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:07,880
Great choice.

11
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,333
- Who shall it be today, Mr. May?
- Mr. Sandberg, please.

12
00:02:20,226 --> 00:02:22,161
Here's Mr. Sandberg.

13
00:02:22,194 --> 00:02:24,296
Coming up to
two months now.

14
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:28,434
Just the one?

15
00:02:29,802 --> 00:02:32,338
Just Mr. Sandberg,
thank you.

16
00:02:32,371 --> 00:02:34,473
We'll give the others
a little more time.

17
00:02:36,743 --> 00:02:38,277
You never know.

18
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,762
- Good morning, Mr. May.
- Good morning, Mr. White.

19
00:03:29,796 --> 00:03:31,463
They're piling up
in there, Mr. May.

20
00:03:31,497 --> 00:03:32,565
I'm just expecting
some news

21
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,967
for Mr. Radulovitz
and Mrs. Casement.

22
00:03:35,001 --> 00:03:36,202
I'm very optimistic.

23
00:03:36,235 --> 00:03:38,805
Mr. Radulovitz has been on
the shelf two good months.

24
00:03:38,838 --> 00:03:40,172
What about the others?

25
00:03:40,206 --> 00:03:42,241
Come the summer,
they'll be sharing bunks.

26
00:03:42,274 --> 00:03:43,843
We do have leads.

27
00:03:43,876 --> 00:03:45,645
Not every door is shut.

28
00:03:45,678 --> 00:03:47,513
There may still
be someone!

29
00:06:26,338 --> 00:06:28,240
She was found
two days ago.

30
00:06:28,274 --> 00:06:31,110
Someone saw the cat
in the street, leaving.

31
00:06:49,095 --> 00:06:50,262
"To my little Susie. "

32
00:06:50,296 --> 00:06:52,664
"Happy birthday, Mum. "

33
00:06:52,698 --> 00:06:54,967
I was told
there was no family.

34
00:06:56,202 --> 00:06:58,905
In over 10 years I've
never seen anyone.

35
00:07:03,275 --> 00:07:05,311
The postmark is last year.

36
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,160
"Monday, went to the shops. "

37
00:07:21,193 --> 00:07:23,362
"Bought some fish.
She liked it. "

38
00:07:23,395 --> 00:07:26,065
"Tuesday, the shops. "
It's all the same.

39
00:07:36,575 --> 00:07:38,544
A - ha, here you are.

40
00:07:38,577 --> 00:07:42,048
"Dear Mum, thank you so much
for my wonderful present. "

41
00:07:43,749 --> 00:07:45,651
So she had a daughter?

42
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,457
"Please write again soon.
Love you with all my heart. "

43
00:07:52,825 --> 00:07:55,127
Ah. "Susie. "

44
00:07:55,161 --> 00:07:56,395
Susie's the cat.

45
00:07:59,531 --> 00:08:01,968
Look. It's from the cat.

46
00:08:03,235 --> 00:08:05,471
It's signed with a little paw.

47
00:08:07,773 --> 00:08:09,408
Some people, eh?

48
00:09:14,506 --> 00:09:15,908
Please call these people.

49
00:09:15,942 --> 00:09:18,877
Anything they won't take
can be thrown away.

50
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,062
London Borough
of Kennington,

51
00:09:36,095 --> 00:09:38,530
Client Services,
John May speaking.

52
00:09:39,698 --> 00:09:41,333
Mr. Radulovitz.

53
00:09:41,367 --> 00:09:43,035
Yes! And you are?

54
00:09:44,403 --> 00:09:46,072
Mr. Radley.

55
00:09:46,105 --> 00:09:48,707
And your connection with...

56
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,609
His son?

57
00:09:50,642 --> 00:09:52,644
But your sur...

58
00:09:52,678 --> 00:09:54,213
You've changed it?

59
00:09:54,246 --> 00:09:55,982
Right. Great.

60
00:09:56,015 --> 00:09:57,816
Thank you very much
for calling. Great.

61
00:09:57,849 --> 00:10:00,886
That's just...
Just wonderful.

62
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:06,258
Unfortunately, as you know,
your father has passed away. Yes.

63
00:10:06,825 --> 00:10:07,994
Died six weeks ago.

64
00:10:09,428 --> 00:10:12,164
Well, you were contact...
Well, actually, in this office,

65
00:10:12,198 --> 00:10:13,665
we're charged with
tracing the relatives

66
00:10:13,699 --> 00:10:15,301
of those who passed
away in the borough.

67
00:10:15,334 --> 00:10:17,203
And, failing that...

68
00:10:17,236 --> 00:10:19,705
Yes.
Yes, your fath...

69
00:10:19,738 --> 00:10:24,176
Uh, no, no, there's no obligation for
the next of kin to pay for the funeral.

70
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,777
No, you don't.

71
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:28,814
Indeed.

72
00:10:28,847 --> 00:10:31,583
There is no obligation
to attend, but...

73
00:10:33,585 --> 00:10:36,655
If I may say so...
I understand, Mr. Radu...

74
00:10:37,356 --> 00:10:39,291
I mean, Mr. Radley.

75
00:10:39,325 --> 00:10:42,961
Your father Mr. Radulovitz
might not have been

76
00:10:42,995 --> 00:10:45,331
the best of fathers,
but, if I...

77
00:10:45,998 --> 00:10:49,135
What do I...
My family?

78
00:10:49,168 --> 00:10:50,869
No, I don't have a...

79
00:10:50,902 --> 00:10:54,673
But surely, now that he's passed away,
his children should...

80
00:10:54,706 --> 00:10:57,743
But to have found a father
after all these years...

81
00:10:57,776 --> 00:10:59,078
I would...

82
00:10:59,111 --> 00:11:03,049
Wouldn't you want your children,
his grandchildren, to know?

83
00:11:03,815 --> 00:11:05,651
It's not too late.

84
00:11:05,684 --> 00:11:08,287
Uh, no. I... I know
he's dead, but...

85
00:11:09,888 --> 00:11:11,390
You're right.

86
00:11:12,258 --> 00:11:14,726
I wouldn't know.

87
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,962
And would you be
able to think of anyone

88
00:11:16,995 --> 00:11:18,930
who might have had contact?

89
00:11:18,964 --> 00:11:22,868
Someone who might at least want
to be present at the funeral?

90
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,671
No.

91
00:11:25,704 --> 00:11:27,773
And you...
You wouldn't...

92
00:11:28,507 --> 00:11:29,608
No.

93
00:11:30,376 --> 00:11:31,977
Very well, Mr. Radulovitz.

94
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,280
I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. Radley.

95
00:11:34,313 --> 00:11:36,548
I understand.
Thank you.

96
00:11:37,816 --> 00:11:39,085
Good-bye.

97
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,075
Who says it's my dog?
How do you know it's his piss?

98
00:12:37,109 --> 00:12:39,911
That dog is always
out here, always.

99
00:12:39,945 --> 00:12:42,181
I only have to open my door
and he rushes in my house.

100
00:12:42,214 --> 00:12:43,882
Are you some sort
of dog piss expert?

101
00:12:43,915 --> 00:12:45,517
Have a look up the wall.
Look how high it is.

102
00:12:45,551 --> 00:12:46,652
I only got a little dog.

103
00:15:24,242 --> 00:15:26,244
Yes, yes.
I would like to confirm

104
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:29,648
that a package addressed
to Miss Dawn Harvey...

105
00:15:29,681 --> 00:15:31,550
What was in it?

106
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,152
Well, why do you
need to know?

107
00:15:34,185 --> 00:15:36,922
Ashes. The ashes
of Mr. George Harvey.

108
00:15:38,524 --> 00:15:40,792
What kind of ashes?

109
00:15:40,826 --> 00:15:42,994
Excuse me, am I speaking
to Australia Post,

110
00:15:43,028 --> 00:15:47,366
Yeperenye Shopping Center,
13 Cactus Street, Alice Springs?

111
00:15:49,735 --> 00:15:51,737
Uh, what else?
Let me see.

112
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,805
He has a blue paw

113
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,341
and there's
a gray mark on...

114
00:15:55,374 --> 00:15:58,076
Ah! Now, this could help.
There's a...

115
00:15:58,109 --> 00:16:02,113
He has a tattoo
on his right ear of...

116
00:16:03,415 --> 00:16:06,217
Well, as I said, we found
the dog next to the body.

117
00:16:06,251 --> 00:16:08,554
I mean,
in the apartment of Mr. Didion.

118
00:16:08,587 --> 00:16:10,288
And we thought that someone
involved with dog racing

119
00:16:10,322 --> 00:16:12,358
might know the dog,
and therefore, the owner.

120
00:17:06,211 --> 00:17:08,814
We are here to celebrate
the life of Jane Ford,

121
00:17:08,847 --> 00:17:12,684
a woman who enjoyed life
for all it could bring.

122
00:17:12,718 --> 00:17:14,820
She was born in the
summer of 1945,

123
00:17:14,853 --> 00:17:18,356
as peace finally came to
the world, in Scarborough.

124
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:21,560
The only daughter of
Jack and Nora Ford.

125
00:17:21,593 --> 00:17:24,730
And what a joy it must have
been for them to hold her.

126
00:17:24,763 --> 00:17:30,035
The lovely, maybe unexpected fruit of
a rare reunion in those turbulent times.

127
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,706
She grew to enjoy what
life most readily offered,

128
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,908
the warmth of a sunny
day at the beach,

129
00:17:36,942 --> 00:17:39,411
a simple yet
tasteful necklace,

130
00:17:39,445 --> 00:17:41,547
a new stick of red lipstick.

131
00:17:44,282 --> 00:17:47,318
She was passionate about dance,
flamenco in particular,

132
00:17:47,352 --> 00:17:49,154
and always looked gorgeous
when stepping out

133
00:17:49,187 --> 00:17:52,190
on the dance floor
in her red dress.

134
00:17:52,223 --> 00:17:53,725
Later in life,
her love of animals

135
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:56,027
made her care for
her sweet cat, Susie,

136
00:17:56,061 --> 00:17:57,996
with whom she shared
many happy years,

137
00:17:58,029 --> 00:18:01,667
always celebrating Christmas
together in great style.

138
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,272
Just you again, Mr. May?

139
00:18:08,006 --> 00:18:09,941
Afraid so.

140
00:18:09,975 --> 00:18:12,210
Six in this one already.
This is the last one.

141
00:19:39,665 --> 00:19:42,901
Got yourself a cracking
spot there, Mr. May.

142
00:19:46,104 --> 00:19:47,338
By the time it's your turn,

143
00:19:47,372 --> 00:19:51,743
those branches will be shading
anyone who comes to visit you.

144
00:19:51,777 --> 00:19:54,713
Good to plan this
kind of thing.

145
00:19:54,746 --> 00:19:56,748
Uncle Fred ended
up in Surbiton.

146
00:19:58,016 --> 00:20:00,986
I'm sure he wouldn't
have liked that one bit.

147
00:20:12,664 --> 00:20:15,601
London Borough of Kennington,
Client Services.

148
00:20:16,534 --> 00:20:18,570
Good afternoon, Mr. Huxley.

149
00:20:19,404 --> 00:20:21,206
Very well, thank you.

150
00:20:22,908 --> 00:20:24,943
Found today.

151
00:20:29,615 --> 00:20:31,416
No point of contact.

152
00:20:32,684 --> 00:20:35,320
Yes.
I will go this afternoon.

153
00:20:35,353 --> 00:20:37,022
And the address?

154
00:21:42,453 --> 00:21:45,223
The neighbors complained
about the smell.

155
00:21:47,092 --> 00:21:49,695
The police said it
must've been weeks.

156
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:54,700
I didn't really know him.

157
00:21:54,733 --> 00:21:57,135
Bit of a loner.
You know the type.

158
00:21:58,737 --> 00:22:00,739
So you live opposite, eh?

159
00:22:02,273 --> 00:22:03,942
Did you know him?

160
00:22:06,477 --> 00:22:08,579
No, I didn't know him.

161
00:22:10,548 --> 00:22:13,118
I only get involved
if there's a problem.

162
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:17,088
Boiler.
Something like that.

163
00:22:21,592 --> 00:22:23,461
You better wear these.

164
00:22:56,327 --> 00:22:58,096
I can't see a record player.

165
00:22:58,129 --> 00:23:00,065
No. He probably sold it
for a couple of drinks.

166
00:23:00,098 --> 00:23:01,099
Oh.

167
00:23:40,138 --> 00:23:42,340
Ah!
What about that, eh?

168
00:23:43,174 --> 00:23:44,609
Time stops for no one.

169
00:24:04,562 --> 00:24:07,966
Here he is.
Billy Stoke.

170
00:24:09,367 --> 00:24:10,969
I can't say I recognize him.

171
00:24:11,769 --> 00:24:13,571
They all look the same,
don't they?

172
00:24:22,513 --> 00:24:24,950
Call the health department.

173
00:24:24,983 --> 00:24:28,519
They need to clean and clear
this place as soon as possible.

174
00:24:28,553 --> 00:24:30,588
Except for the carriage clock.

175
00:24:30,621 --> 00:24:33,624
That goes to the pawn
brokers on the High Street.

176
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:01,887
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

177
00:25:02,954 --> 00:25:04,422
Good-bye now.

178
00:25:12,898 --> 00:25:14,799
No family again, Mr. May?

179
00:25:14,832 --> 00:25:15,934
Maybe.

180
00:25:15,967 --> 00:25:17,002
Mr. May.

181
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,242
Mr. Pratchett.

182
00:25:25,576 --> 00:25:27,879
Could I see you
in my office, please?

183
00:25:31,182 --> 00:25:35,220
As I said, your department is being
amalgamated with that of the Dulwich office,

184
00:25:35,253 --> 00:25:37,222
here represented
by Miss Pilger.

185
00:25:37,255 --> 00:25:41,026
And from today the coroner is
referring all cases to the new office.

186
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:43,161
- Dulwich.
- Mmm-hmm.

187
00:25:45,997 --> 00:25:47,398
I guess I could
buy a bicycle.

188
00:25:47,432 --> 00:25:49,134
Oh, no,
you don't understand.

189
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:50,902
You won't need to travel,
that's the point.

190
00:25:50,936 --> 00:25:52,503
Uh, given the current
pressure on finances,

191
00:25:52,537 --> 00:25:55,073
the council is undertaking a
new round of efficiency savings.

192
00:25:55,106 --> 00:25:56,241
We're letting you go.

193
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,111
You're letting me go?

194
00:26:00,145 --> 00:26:01,879
Mr. May, in the two months
I've been here,

195
00:26:01,913 --> 00:26:03,248
I've been able to
observe you at work.

196
00:26:03,281 --> 00:26:04,549
And there's no doubt
you're very thorough,

197
00:26:04,582 --> 00:26:07,885
but, if I may say so,
you're also very slow,

198
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,187
not to say expensive,

199
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,755
given the number of
funerals you choose

200
00:26:10,788 --> 00:26:12,958
to organize as opposed
to cremations.

201
00:26:12,991 --> 00:26:14,659
But when there are
indications of religious...

202
00:26:14,692 --> 00:26:17,395
John, you've been with
the council for how long?

203
00:26:19,064 --> 00:26:21,598
- Twenty-two years.
- Twenty-two years.

204
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,435
Well, I think you should see
this as an opportunity

205
00:26:24,469 --> 00:26:26,637
for a new beginning,
don't you?

206
00:26:26,671 --> 00:26:28,606
A new life.

207
00:26:28,639 --> 00:26:30,175
I'm sure the
council's references

208
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:33,979
will enable you to find
new and challenging work.

209
00:26:34,012 --> 00:26:36,647
A job where people
are alive, for a change?

210
00:26:55,566 --> 00:26:57,568
What about this
morning's case?

211
00:26:57,602 --> 00:27:00,238
This morning? Ah, yes.
That'll be your last one.

212
00:27:00,938 --> 00:27:03,174
Please close it in three days.

213
00:31:47,725 --> 00:31:48,993
Should be the right size.

214
00:31:49,026 --> 00:31:50,261
Sorry about this.

215
00:31:50,295 --> 00:31:52,162
You know, health rules.

216
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,265
I understand.

217
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:56,734
I also have to wear this
stuff at work sometimes.

218
00:31:56,767 --> 00:31:58,403
You're in food processing,
too, then?

219
00:31:58,836 --> 00:32:00,004
Baking?

220
00:32:00,037 --> 00:32:03,274
Baking? No. No, not really baking.
I'm actually a...

221
00:32:04,542 --> 00:32:07,545
Well, I only have to wear
this when I see people.

222
00:32:07,945 --> 00:32:08,979
People?

223
00:32:09,914 --> 00:32:13,418
Yes. I mean people, uh,

224
00:32:13,451 --> 00:32:15,653
who, who don't
bake anymore.

225
00:32:31,969 --> 00:32:34,605
Billy.
Billy Stoke.

226
00:32:36,407 --> 00:32:39,944
Worst player in the team.
Nobody would dare kick him out.

227
00:32:41,045 --> 00:32:42,547
Bloody temper.

228
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:47,618
Hear that?

229
00:32:47,652 --> 00:32:51,889
Managed to fight both management and
union reps about the afternoon break.

230
00:32:51,922 --> 00:32:55,259
He won us five extra minutes,
then, uh, fucked off.

231
00:32:55,292 --> 00:32:57,528
Just, uh,
just packed it in.

232
00:32:57,562 --> 00:33:00,731
But before he does that,
what does he do?

233
00:33:00,765 --> 00:33:02,833
Pisses in a vat
of pork meat.

234
00:33:02,867 --> 00:33:04,369
Some of the batch
got through.

235
00:33:04,402 --> 00:33:06,471
Pies never tasted so good.

236
00:33:06,504 --> 00:33:08,038
Here, have one.

237
00:33:14,445 --> 00:33:16,481
Thank you.
I don't smoke.

238
00:33:24,922 --> 00:33:27,658
We found this in his home.

239
00:33:31,429 --> 00:33:33,631
Do you know who she might be?

240
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,634
No idea.

241
00:33:37,802 --> 00:33:39,737
Looks a bit like him.

242
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:41,138
Daughter, maybe?

243
00:33:41,171 --> 00:33:42,673
Yes.

244
00:33:42,707 --> 00:33:44,709
That's what I think.

245
00:33:44,742 --> 00:33:48,379
It would be nice to give it
to her if she was still alive.

246
00:33:48,413 --> 00:33:49,580
He must have loved her.

247
00:33:50,381 --> 00:33:52,517
Funny, though.

248
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:54,051
He never mentioned a family.

249
00:33:56,086 --> 00:33:58,423
We were best mates, really...

250
00:33:58,456 --> 00:34:00,558
...for a time.

251
00:34:00,591 --> 00:34:04,228
Like school kids,
you know, just older.

252
00:34:04,995 --> 00:34:07,197
He was like me older brother.

253
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:12,336
Then, uh, Billy met the
fish-and-chips lady in Whitby,

254
00:34:13,003 --> 00:34:14,405
and he left to be with her.

255
00:34:14,439 --> 00:34:15,640
Whitby?

256
00:34:17,274 --> 00:34:19,309
Would you know her name?

257
00:34:19,343 --> 00:34:20,478
Her address, maybe?

258
00:34:20,511 --> 00:34:23,748
No, sorry. Only saw her
a couple of times.

259
00:34:23,781 --> 00:34:25,382
Lovely girl, though.

260
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:27,885
Billy always had a
way with the ladies.

261
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,856
Something about him.
Always on the edge.

262
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:35,059
I don't know.

263
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,328
Do you understand women?

264
00:34:41,499 --> 00:34:45,069
There will be a funeral in a
few days' time in London.

265
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:48,005
Would you consider coming?

266
00:34:48,038 --> 00:34:49,373
A funeral?

267
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,610
Don't know.

268
00:34:52,643 --> 00:34:55,946
I mean, it would be good to
have a drink with him, but...

269
00:34:56,914 --> 00:34:58,783
A funeral?

270
00:34:58,816 --> 00:35:00,551
After so long...

271
00:35:07,157 --> 00:35:10,528
You miss that train next
time and I won't be waiting.

272
00:35:10,561 --> 00:35:12,196
Yeah, you will.
You love me too much.

273
00:35:12,229 --> 00:35:14,198
The 12:50 service
to London, St. Pancras...

274
00:35:14,231 --> 00:35:16,066
- I might have better offers.
- ... is delayed until 13:05.

275
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,502
Bollocks.
Hey!

276
00:35:17,535 --> 00:35:19,637
You'll never find anyone who
loves you as much as I do.

277
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,438
Yeah? How much do
you love me then?

278
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:24,542
Well, I love you more than
you love me, that's for sure.

279
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:32,817
A black tea, please.

280
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:34,418
You should try
the hot chocolate.

281
00:35:34,451 --> 00:35:37,221
Just got this new machine.
It's gorgeous.

282
00:35:41,091 --> 00:35:42,426
All right.

283
00:35:43,861 --> 00:35:45,830
A hot chocolate, please.

284
00:35:55,072 --> 00:35:57,207
The train departing
from platform three

285
00:35:57,241 --> 00:36:00,377
is the 12:50 service
to London, St. Pancras.

286
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,179
Hello, Mr. Pratchett?

287
00:36:35,212 --> 00:36:37,648
Yes, Mr. Pratchett,
it's John May.

288
00:36:38,883 --> 00:36:41,719
John May, Client Services?

289
00:36:42,687 --> 00:36:45,089
Yes, I know.
I'm sorry.

290
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:49,026
I haven't been
feeling myself today.

291
00:36:49,059 --> 00:36:51,095
No, still not quite right.

292
00:36:52,262 --> 00:36:54,965
I don't think I will
be in tomorrow.

293
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:56,066
Yes, yes, of course.

294
00:36:56,867 --> 00:36:58,636
Good-bye, Mr. Pratch...

295
00:39:30,087 --> 00:39:32,522
Just put them on
top of the others.

296
00:39:34,024 --> 00:39:36,360
When he was good,
he was wonderful.

297
00:39:36,393 --> 00:39:38,963
And kind and loving.

298
00:39:38,996 --> 00:39:42,332
When he was bad,
you got out the room.

299
00:39:43,633 --> 00:39:46,270
Just half the sack
in the peeler!

300
00:39:46,303 --> 00:39:50,908
And then pull the switch above
your head, the one on the left.

301
00:39:54,845 --> 00:39:57,281
When they're done,
in the chipper.

302
00:40:06,957 --> 00:40:10,327
And don't put your hands
in if you like your fingers.

303
00:40:14,698 --> 00:40:18,235
I can only tell you about
his life here with me.

304
00:40:18,268 --> 00:40:20,805
He never spoke
about his life before.

305
00:40:23,173 --> 00:40:24,775
He could give you
so much just in a day,

306
00:40:24,809 --> 00:40:26,877
you didn't want to be anywhere
else but with him.

307
00:40:26,911 --> 00:40:28,178
Do you know what I mean?

308
00:40:29,446 --> 00:40:31,348
It was me who asked
him to move in.

309
00:40:31,381 --> 00:40:33,818
Worked a while on the boats.

310
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:36,520
That went, thanks to
those fools in Brussels.

311
00:40:36,553 --> 00:40:38,755
So he started
helping out in here.

312
00:40:38,789 --> 00:40:40,490
He was good at it.

313
00:40:40,524 --> 00:40:43,193
Put extra beer in the batter.
Customers were happy.

314
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:47,031
And it was nice to have
him around all day.

315
00:40:49,133 --> 00:40:51,501
Strange job you've got.

316
00:40:51,535 --> 00:40:53,170
All those lives.

317
00:40:54,238 --> 00:40:55,739
I couldn't do it.

318
00:40:57,641 --> 00:40:58,809
I like my work.

319
00:40:58,843 --> 00:41:00,210
Here, love.

320
00:41:07,051 --> 00:41:08,152
You got that paper?

321
00:41:08,185 --> 00:41:09,353
Oh, hell, I forgot.

322
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:11,188
Give me a minute.
Mind the child, will you?

323
00:41:16,793 --> 00:41:18,362
Bit early for
another inspection.

324
00:41:18,395 --> 00:41:20,064
Had the last one mid-summer.

325
00:41:20,097 --> 00:41:22,299
No, no. I'm here
to find people,

326
00:41:22,332 --> 00:41:25,535
well, friends maybe, for a man
who was here 20 years ago.

327
00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:26,770
William Stoke?

328
00:41:26,803 --> 00:41:28,038
Him?

329
00:41:28,072 --> 00:41:30,607
You won't find any friends
of his around here.

330
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,143
What's he done now,
killed somebody?

331
00:41:33,177 --> 00:41:36,013
No. Actually, he died
a few weeks ago.

332
00:41:36,981 --> 00:41:38,748
Well, good riddance.

333
00:41:38,782 --> 00:41:41,385
Wasn't all there,
if you ask me.

334
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:43,954
Fried a man alive, he did.

335
00:41:43,988 --> 00:41:45,555
This guy were
faffin' with Mary.

336
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:47,557
Billy gets vexed,
lands him one.

337
00:41:47,591 --> 00:41:49,659
So the guy
picks up a knife.

338
00:41:49,693 --> 00:41:51,061
Billy grabs his arm,

339
00:41:51,095 --> 00:41:53,830
shoves it in the fryer,
up to here and holds it there.

340
00:41:53,864 --> 00:41:55,799
Knife and all.

341
00:41:55,832 --> 00:41:57,467
Mad, I tell you.

342
00:41:59,669 --> 00:42:01,605
- Says here it should be
paid in June. - Hello.

343
00:42:01,638 --> 00:42:02,940
Good morning.

344
00:42:02,973 --> 00:42:05,709
Uh, don't worry about that, love.
I'll sort that out.

345
00:42:05,742 --> 00:42:07,344
Did you miss Mummy?

346
00:42:07,377 --> 00:42:10,247
Was just tellin' him about
when Billy fried that guy.

347
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,515
Mad, eh?

348
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:17,321
Don't forget we promised Mum
we'd take her to the bingo.

349
00:42:17,354 --> 00:42:21,091
Want some more?
Huh? No?

350
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:23,227
Don't listen to him.

351
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:26,463
Billy were cleared,
completely.

352
00:42:26,496 --> 00:42:29,299
But he wasn't the
same after that.

353
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:31,635
Started drinking a lot.

354
00:42:31,668 --> 00:42:33,904
Became impossible,
even with me.

355
00:42:35,105 --> 00:42:38,008
And after a while,
he just upped and left.

356
00:42:40,945 --> 00:42:43,013
We found this in his room.

357
00:42:51,121 --> 00:42:53,457
Do you recognize her?

358
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:55,725
Did he ever speak
of a family?

359
00:42:56,693 --> 00:42:57,761
No.

360
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:02,432
He never spoke
of having a family.

361
00:43:04,434 --> 00:43:07,037
He did leave something behind,
but he never knew about it.

362
00:43:19,549 --> 00:43:21,918
Shift ends at 4:30,
so I'll see you then.

363
00:43:21,952 --> 00:43:23,320
Bye, love.

364
00:43:24,188 --> 00:43:25,389
Bye.

365
00:43:25,524 --> 00:43:26,456
Bye.

366
00:43:32,729 --> 00:43:35,599
Miss Jones, there will be
a funeral, Billy's funeral,

367
00:43:35,632 --> 00:43:37,467
in a few days, in London.
You must come.

368
00:43:37,501 --> 00:43:40,137
Bring his daughter and his granddaughter.
It's wonderful...

369
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:42,339
I'm sorry,
it's not possible.

370
00:43:44,908 --> 00:43:47,511
But you're his family.

371
00:43:47,544 --> 00:43:50,280
We're not his family.
He didn't want one.

372
00:43:51,115 --> 00:43:52,983
And I can't.

373
00:43:53,017 --> 00:43:55,419
It's too long ago.
It's too much to explain.

374
00:43:55,452 --> 00:43:56,953
The council could help
with the transport.

375
00:43:56,987 --> 00:43:58,955
I loved him.

376
00:43:58,989 --> 00:44:01,925
Never loved anyone else since,
but I can't.

377
00:44:02,792 --> 00:44:04,594
Please don't insist.

378
00:44:09,933 --> 00:44:12,769
Do you know where he might have
moved on to when he left?

379
00:44:13,237 --> 00:44:14,504
No idea.

380
00:44:15,605 --> 00:44:16,840
Prison, most likely.

381
00:47:46,816 --> 00:47:48,318
Good morning, Mr. White.

382
00:47:48,352 --> 00:47:51,421
Mr. May. What news
from the land of the livin'?

383
00:47:53,122 --> 00:47:55,425
"Friar in Robin Hood's
band," four letters?

384
00:47:56,926 --> 00:47:59,028
- Tuck.
- Yeah, Tuck.

385
00:47:59,062 --> 00:48:00,964
You're wasted here, Mr. May.

386
00:48:00,997 --> 00:48:04,968
Mastermind, big leather chair,
that's where you belong.

387
00:48:05,001 --> 00:48:06,370
I'd give it a go,
if I were you.

388
00:48:06,403 --> 00:48:08,905
Mr. White, our last case,

389
00:48:09,973 --> 00:48:11,708
William Stoke.

390
00:48:11,741 --> 00:48:15,011
Row two, tray eight.
Forty days rotting, I believe.

391
00:48:17,013 --> 00:48:18,214
Forty?

392
00:48:19,249 --> 00:48:21,518
Well, he won't have
to wait any longer.

393
00:48:21,551 --> 00:48:22,786
If you can get
him ready, please.

394
00:48:25,088 --> 00:48:28,925
Oh, they've just taken another
three for cremation this afternoon.

395
00:48:28,958 --> 00:48:31,428
I've got more checkin' out
than checkin' in these days.

396
00:48:31,461 --> 00:48:34,431
I'll be out of a job soon.

397
00:48:34,464 --> 00:48:36,099
Here, Mr. May,

398
00:48:36,132 --> 00:48:38,535
"Flightless bird,"
four letters?

399
00:48:39,369 --> 00:48:41,104
Dodo.

400
00:48:41,137 --> 00:48:43,673
D - O - D - O,
"Dodo. "

401
00:48:43,707 --> 00:48:45,442
I never heard of it.

402
00:48:45,475 --> 00:48:47,677
You're a rare thing, Mr. May!

403
00:49:03,026 --> 00:49:05,962
Another fruitful day, John,
almost there?

404
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:09,366
Mr. Pratchett.

405
00:49:09,399 --> 00:49:11,134
Miss Pilger tells me
of great progress, John.

406
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:13,169
The council's very pleased.

407
00:49:13,202 --> 00:49:15,905
I'm sure you'll be pleased in turn
with the references I'm preparing.

408
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,575
Thank you.

409
00:49:19,709 --> 00:49:21,745
See, it wasn't that
difficult, after all.

410
00:49:22,779 --> 00:49:23,880
Sorry?

411
00:49:23,913 --> 00:49:26,950
Yeah, I've been thinking
about this, your job.

412
00:49:30,354 --> 00:49:31,955
And let's face it.
The dead are dead.

413
00:49:31,988 --> 00:49:34,157
Funerals are for the living.

414
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:37,126
So, if there's no one there,
there's no one to care. Right?

415
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,228
I mean, for the living,

416
00:49:40,263 --> 00:49:41,431
could be better not to know.

417
00:49:41,465 --> 00:49:44,401
You know, no funeral,
no sadness, no tears.

418
00:49:46,403 --> 00:49:47,971
What do you think?

419
00:49:49,506 --> 00:49:52,376
I can't say I've ever thought
of it that way, Mr. Pratchett.

420
00:49:52,409 --> 00:49:54,544
Well, anyway,
the dead are dead.

421
00:49:54,578 --> 00:49:57,581
They're not there.
They don't care. All right?

422
00:50:30,647 --> 00:50:32,449
Mr. Pratchett!
Mr. Pratchett!

423
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,454
- Yes, John?
- Mr. Pratchett...

424
00:50:36,386 --> 00:50:39,122
I need a few more days.

425
00:50:39,155 --> 00:50:41,791
More days? I'm afraid that
won't be possible, John.

426
00:50:41,825 --> 00:50:45,429
- The council's already decided...
- My last case, William Stoke.

427
00:50:45,462 --> 00:50:48,432
John, John, there's really no need
for you to. Miss Pilger can sort it.

428
00:50:48,465 --> 00:50:50,600
It'll only take a few days.

429
00:50:55,739 --> 00:50:59,075
Right. All right. But it'll
have to be on your own time.

430
00:50:59,108 --> 00:51:00,810
Your termination notice
has already been signed

431
00:51:00,844 --> 00:51:03,079
and the council can't
reissue it. Okay?

432
00:51:03,112 --> 00:51:05,782
Of course.
I understand, Mr. Pratchett.

433
00:51:16,359 --> 00:51:19,929
No, no, no. We have no knowledge
of an actual conviction.

434
00:51:19,963 --> 00:51:24,100
But, you see, Mr. Stoke was on a,
a particular trajectory.

435
00:51:39,048 --> 00:51:43,419
I think mostly short spells,
vagrancy, assaults,

436
00:51:43,453 --> 00:51:46,556
that sort of thing, but,
uh, no trouble inside.

437
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:48,592
And you have no record
of any visitors?

438
00:51:48,625 --> 00:51:51,495
No. We sent the old logs off
to the Metropolitan Archives.

439
00:51:51,528 --> 00:51:53,262
And they can't
find them there?

440
00:51:53,296 --> 00:51:55,164
Well, you could try
the Home Office, but,

441
00:51:55,198 --> 00:51:56,966
you know, we're talking
about 20 years ago.

442
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,835
Seventeen, actually.

443
00:51:58,868 --> 00:52:01,671
Mr. May, if we have to remember
what happens to every man

444
00:52:01,705 --> 00:52:04,974
who's walked through here,
we wouldn't get much sleep at night.

445
00:52:05,008 --> 00:52:06,776
And I like my sleep.

446
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:14,984
I'll tell you one thing.

447
00:52:15,018 --> 00:52:16,753
Your Billy once hung
over the edge

448
00:52:16,786 --> 00:52:20,624
of the third floor landing
from a belt with his teeth.

449
00:52:20,657 --> 00:52:22,659
Three-and-a-half minutes.

450
00:52:22,692 --> 00:52:24,994
He was raising money
for some charity.

451
00:52:25,028 --> 00:52:27,731
And all the lads
put a few quid in.

452
00:52:27,764 --> 00:52:28,832
His teeth?

453
00:52:28,865 --> 00:52:31,434
Yeah, his teeth, yeah.

454
00:52:32,769 --> 00:52:34,571
How about that, then?

455
00:52:36,573 --> 00:52:38,241
Good-bye, Mr. May.

456
00:55:43,192 --> 00:55:44,293
Yes?

457
00:55:45,161 --> 00:55:46,595
Kelly Stoke?

458
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:48,464
Sorry?

459
00:55:49,198 --> 00:55:51,000
You are not Kelly Stoke?

460
00:55:53,602 --> 00:55:56,505
- Sorry?
- Daughter of William Stoke?

461
00:55:56,539 --> 00:55:58,574
Yeah. Sorry, who are you?

462
00:55:59,675 --> 00:56:01,711
I'm John May.

463
00:56:01,745 --> 00:56:03,146
Kennington Borough Council.

464
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,481
Kennington?

465
00:56:06,382 --> 00:56:08,617
I have some sad news,
I'm afraid.

466
00:56:12,922 --> 00:56:14,724
Your father has died.

467
00:56:24,367 --> 00:56:25,501
When?

468
00:56:26,402 --> 00:56:28,471
Well, it's hard
to say exactly.

469
00:56:31,474 --> 00:56:32,575
Why?

470
00:56:36,479 --> 00:56:38,047
- Because...
- Um...

471
00:56:39,382 --> 00:56:41,117
I don't wanna know.

472
00:56:45,889 --> 00:56:47,256
Thank you.

473
00:56:58,267 --> 00:56:59,635
Miss Stoke.

474
00:57:00,804 --> 00:57:02,305
There is this.

475
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,309
I found it in his flat.

476
00:57:40,844 --> 00:57:42,611
He never even wrote.

477
00:57:45,748 --> 00:57:47,350
I was so angry.

478
00:57:48,351 --> 00:57:50,053
Still am, I guess.

479
00:57:53,689 --> 00:57:56,492
Then one day,
it was my birthday, 18.

480
00:57:57,493 --> 00:57:59,395
He called.

481
00:57:59,428 --> 00:58:02,598
He didn't mention
my birthday,

482
00:58:02,631 --> 00:58:04,433
but he must've known.

483
00:58:05,368 --> 00:58:06,870
He must have.

484
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:10,473
- Don't you think?
- Of course.

485
00:58:10,506 --> 00:58:12,876
Of course he knew.
He remembered.

486
00:58:15,344 --> 00:58:16,880
Well, he was
in prison, drunk,

487
00:58:16,913 --> 00:58:19,182
or so it sounded,

488
00:58:19,215 --> 00:58:21,985
he'd hit rock bottom and...

489
00:58:22,018 --> 00:58:24,320
He wanted to square things
before he got out,

490
00:58:24,353 --> 00:58:26,856
so he could start again.

491
00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:28,925
Mum wasn't sure,
but we still went, though.

492
00:58:30,493 --> 00:58:32,728
I almost didn't recognize him.

493
00:58:33,762 --> 00:58:35,431
But he knew who I was.

494
00:58:35,464 --> 00:58:38,701
And I had changed,
you know, in eight years.

495
00:58:38,734 --> 00:58:41,237
But he knew as
soon as I walked in.

496
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:43,106
Yeah.
Yeah.

497
00:58:46,709 --> 00:58:49,078
Only as soon as
he turned around,

498
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,515
it all came out.

499
00:58:53,349 --> 00:58:55,351
I don't know where from.

500
00:58:56,852 --> 00:59:00,556
I just started about Mum,

501
00:59:00,589 --> 00:59:03,659
him leavin' us,
how selfish he was.

502
00:59:06,395 --> 00:59:09,899
And then he started shoutin'
'cause Billy Stoke never backed down

503
00:59:09,933 --> 00:59:12,135
in the face of a row, did he?

504
00:59:13,036 --> 00:59:14,803
And it was horrible.

505
00:59:17,073 --> 00:59:18,975
Guard had to come over.

506
00:59:22,811 --> 00:59:24,948
And then he punched
the guard in the face,

507
00:59:24,981 --> 00:59:27,583
turned around,
walked out the door,

508
00:59:27,616 --> 00:59:29,652
and I never saw him again.

509
01:00:08,391 --> 01:00:10,259
That's Dad with Jumbo.

510
01:00:11,427 --> 01:00:14,363
Both Paras.
It's in the Falklands.

511
01:00:16,332 --> 01:00:18,801
They were best mates.

512
01:00:18,834 --> 01:00:22,771
He, uh, got in touch with
me about ten years ago.

513
01:00:22,805 --> 01:00:27,210
Wanted to find Dad. I couldn't help him,
but, uh, he sent me that anyway.

514
01:00:28,677 --> 01:00:30,146
No, take it.

515
01:00:32,515 --> 01:00:34,550
I don't need it, I mean...

516
01:00:38,187 --> 01:00:40,623
I don't know why
I kept it, really.

517
01:00:48,764 --> 01:00:51,300
I'm... I'm fine.

518
01:00:51,334 --> 01:00:53,902
It's just...
Really, it's just, um...

519
01:00:57,106 --> 01:00:59,142
Well, it's just the shock.

520
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,481
I must ask.

521
01:01:06,715 --> 01:01:08,584
Your mother, is she...

522
01:01:09,385 --> 01:01:10,786
She's dead.

523
01:01:12,488 --> 01:01:13,522
Quite peacefully.

524
01:01:13,556 --> 01:01:15,791
And, um,
and someone with her.

525
01:01:18,627 --> 01:01:20,329
Too early, though.

526
01:01:22,298 --> 01:01:23,932
Three years ago.

527
01:01:31,174 --> 01:01:33,442
I'm an orphan as of today.

528
01:01:37,313 --> 01:01:38,381
Yes.

529
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:43,052
That's not nice.

530
01:01:46,855 --> 01:01:49,392
- Whenever it happens.
- No.

531
01:01:57,266 --> 01:01:58,734
I should go.

532
01:02:03,172 --> 01:02:05,474
I'm very grateful
for your time.

533
01:02:31,234 --> 01:02:32,601
Thank you.

534
01:02:36,305 --> 01:02:38,641
Thank you for
coming to tell me.

535
01:02:40,042 --> 01:02:41,377
Of course.

536
01:02:42,811 --> 01:02:45,681
And you have
my number, if...

537
01:02:45,714 --> 01:02:47,950
If you decide to involve
yourself any further.

538
01:02:49,518 --> 01:02:50,953
The funeral.

539
01:02:52,255 --> 01:02:53,322
And I've arranged...

540
01:02:53,356 --> 01:02:55,458
Please, Mr. May,
don't say any more.

541
01:02:57,059 --> 01:02:59,328
You've already
said such a lot.

542
01:03:52,548 --> 01:03:54,317
Excuse me!
Your door!

543
01:03:55,318 --> 01:03:56,685
Your door!

544
01:03:57,486 --> 01:03:58,821
Your door!

545
01:05:06,989 --> 01:05:08,957
John May.

546
01:05:08,991 --> 01:05:10,893
Thought I heard you
comin' down the corridor.

547
01:05:10,926 --> 01:05:12,928
Young footsteps.
Not many of them around here.

548
01:05:13,562 --> 01:05:15,431
Come in.
I'm Jumbo.

549
01:05:15,464 --> 01:05:17,433
Very pleased to
meet you, Jumbo.

550
01:05:17,466 --> 01:05:20,068
Made you some dinner.
Hope it suits.

551
01:05:20,102 --> 01:05:21,203
Some tea there,
just brewed.

552
01:05:21,236 --> 01:05:24,139
Pour yourself a cup
and sit down. Eat.

553
01:05:24,172 --> 01:05:26,609
Thank you very much.

554
01:05:35,684 --> 01:05:37,019
All right?

555
01:05:42,291 --> 01:05:43,892
Yes, thank you.

556
01:05:46,962 --> 01:05:48,731
Perfect.

557
01:05:48,764 --> 01:05:51,800
So, Billy's daughter
told you about me.

558
01:05:53,502 --> 01:05:55,338
I remember her voice.

559
01:05:56,805 --> 01:05:59,041
Must be a lovely girl.
Gentle.

560
01:06:00,409 --> 01:06:03,546
Yes.
Gentle.

561
01:06:03,579 --> 01:06:06,482
Didn't get that
from her father.

562
01:06:06,515 --> 01:06:10,052
Knocked the bloody head off
me my first day in the army.

563
01:06:10,085 --> 01:06:13,255
Wouldn't be here now,
though, if it wasn't for him.

564
01:06:13,288 --> 01:06:14,657
Didn't leave me on
that bloody mountain.

565
01:06:16,091 --> 01:06:17,426
The Falklands?

566
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:18,627
Right.

567
01:06:19,562 --> 01:06:21,029
Fucking place.

568
01:06:24,567 --> 01:06:26,369
You been in the army?

569
01:06:28,471 --> 01:06:29,838
Uh, me?
No.

570
01:06:30,773 --> 01:06:32,341
No, I haven't.

571
01:06:32,375 --> 01:06:35,243
Best and worst of all lives,
the Paras.

572
01:06:36,445 --> 01:06:39,014
Pick the meanest
bastards and then...

573
01:06:42,651 --> 01:06:46,121
When I found him again,
he was on the streets, a dosser.

574
01:06:47,122 --> 01:06:49,392
Mind you, he only slept
in the poshest places,

575
01:06:49,425 --> 01:06:51,727
Berkeley Square, Green Park.

576
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:53,696
No Kings Cross for him.

577
01:06:56,665 --> 01:06:59,402
The drink, helps you forget,

578
01:07:00,836 --> 01:07:03,305
helps you to sleep
without dreamin'.

579
01:07:04,339 --> 01:07:07,376
Then it gets inside you
and it won't come out.

580
01:07:10,245 --> 01:07:13,582
It's awful when you think
about it. Killing a man.

581
01:07:19,054 --> 01:07:21,990
And you...
You stayed on?

582
01:07:22,024 --> 01:07:23,426
No.

583
01:07:23,459 --> 01:07:25,961
As soon as I got out of hospital
I came down to London.

584
01:07:25,994 --> 01:07:28,631
Tried settling down.
Even got married.

585
01:07:29,532 --> 01:07:31,434
What a day that was.

586
01:07:31,467 --> 01:07:33,536
Fell asleep in the church.

587
01:07:34,503 --> 01:07:37,305
We met at a dance.

588
01:07:37,339 --> 01:07:40,909
She was hiding behind the pillars,
pretending not to look.

589
01:07:42,377 --> 01:07:44,747
Two left feet.
Lovely.

590
01:07:46,549 --> 01:07:48,316
Them were the days.

591
01:08:02,264 --> 01:08:03,732
It's all right, Officer.

592
01:08:03,766 --> 01:08:05,033
Just here having a think,
that's all.

593
01:08:05,067 --> 01:08:07,235
He's not from the law,
he's from St. Jude's.

594
01:08:07,269 --> 01:08:08,737
St. Jude's, yeah?

595
01:08:08,771 --> 01:08:11,940
Still tryin' to turn us
off drink for a soup?

596
01:08:11,974 --> 01:08:13,008
What happened?

597
01:08:13,041 --> 01:08:15,310
They used to send pretty
birds to convince us.

598
01:08:15,343 --> 01:08:16,545
Are we not worth it now?

599
01:08:16,579 --> 01:08:19,214
I'm from Kennington Borough.

600
01:08:19,247 --> 01:08:23,519
I'm looking for people who might have
known a man called William Stoke.

601
01:08:23,552 --> 01:08:24,587
Billy Stoke.

602
01:08:25,788 --> 01:08:27,556
I'm told he used to
come here often.

603
01:08:27,590 --> 01:08:30,926
Billy Stoke. You mean Big Billy?
What's with him?

604
01:08:30,959 --> 01:08:33,128
Actually, he passed
away a few weeks ago.

605
01:08:34,296 --> 01:08:36,198
Weeks?

606
01:08:36,231 --> 01:08:39,134
We ain't seen him
for months, years even.

607
01:08:39,802 --> 01:08:42,471
What is it you wanna know?

608
01:08:42,505 --> 01:08:46,475
I'd like to know what he was like,
what acquaintances he had.

609
01:08:46,509 --> 01:08:50,679
Yeah? Well, information like
that is worth the price of a drink.

610
01:08:51,514 --> 01:08:52,681
Don't ya think?

611
01:08:56,318 --> 01:08:57,853
A bottle of whiskey, please.

612
01:08:59,387 --> 01:09:01,724
- Which?
- The large one.

613
01:09:07,062 --> 01:09:09,598
That's what I call a drink.
Good man.

614
01:09:10,999 --> 01:09:13,135
Thanks.

615
01:09:13,168 --> 01:09:16,605
Well, sit down, sit down.
You'll give us a turned neck.

616
01:09:22,444 --> 01:09:23,746
Big Billy.

617
01:09:23,779 --> 01:09:25,347
He was the worst beggar.

618
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:26,448
Hold on a minute.

619
01:09:28,383 --> 01:09:30,853
Here. Have a red one.
They're good.

620
01:09:34,156 --> 01:09:36,424
No, thank you.
I haven't eaten.

621
01:09:59,414 --> 01:10:01,249
His heart wasn't in it,
you see.

622
01:10:01,283 --> 01:10:02,685
The punters felt it.
They never stopped.

623
01:10:02,718 --> 01:10:04,553
See, it was Lesley
who got him to drink.

624
01:10:04,587 --> 01:10:06,121
He'd have been sober
without her.

625
01:10:06,154 --> 01:10:07,289
Lesley?

626
01:10:07,322 --> 01:10:08,456
We were all mad for her.
I mean...

627
01:10:08,490 --> 01:10:09,524
I weren't.

628
01:10:09,558 --> 01:10:11,093
But out of the crew,
she picked Billy,

629
01:10:11,126 --> 01:10:12,595
the only one who
didn't pester her.

630
01:10:12,628 --> 01:10:14,362
- I didn't.
- You did!

631
01:10:14,396 --> 01:10:16,799
God, do you remember that time
he nicked that chocolate for her?

632
01:10:16,832 --> 01:10:19,301
It was all melted.

633
01:10:19,334 --> 01:10:22,504
He's all caked in it,
all covered in this,

634
01:10:22,537 --> 01:10:25,140
ugh, sticky chocolate.

635
01:10:26,909 --> 01:10:31,379
Oh, yeah, he got three months for that.
Just for chocolate.

636
01:10:31,413 --> 01:10:33,782
Do you know where
I can find Lesley?

637
01:10:33,816 --> 01:10:35,417
Bone yard.

638
01:10:36,284 --> 01:10:38,120
Good funeral, though.

639
01:10:38,687 --> 01:10:40,088
Lovely lady.

640
01:10:40,889 --> 01:10:42,424
Good drink after.

641
01:10:42,457 --> 01:10:44,827
You know, they never
seemed to talk.

642
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:47,730
They just sat there
on a bench together.

643
01:10:47,763 --> 01:10:50,833
Well, that's what
we all want, isn't it?

644
01:10:50,866 --> 01:10:53,001
A woman to be quiet with.

645
01:12:04,106 --> 01:12:06,174
Okay, G.

646
01:12:07,743 --> 01:12:11,446
This one here, G 93485.

647
01:12:11,479 --> 01:12:15,050
Ah, 93485.
Right.

648
01:12:15,818 --> 01:12:17,185
Good views.

649
01:12:18,887 --> 01:12:20,288
Aren't they?

650
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:23,625
Lovely.

651
01:12:24,793 --> 01:12:26,128
And you would like to...

652
01:12:26,161 --> 01:12:28,430
I'd like to make it available
for someone else.

653
01:12:28,463 --> 01:12:30,165
A family member?

654
01:12:30,198 --> 01:12:31,533
No family.

655
01:12:33,702 --> 01:12:35,237
Just a friend.

656
01:14:47,135 --> 01:14:51,039
London Borough of Kennington,
Client Services, John May speaking.

657
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:53,541
Yes.

658
01:14:53,575 --> 01:14:55,543
Miss Stoke.
Of course.

659
01:14:57,479 --> 01:14:58,713
11:00.

660
01:15:01,583 --> 01:15:04,419
Not Plymouth, but two
stops before Plymouth.

661
01:15:06,354 --> 01:15:08,957
Off platform two.
Yes.

662
01:15:09,791 --> 01:15:11,793
Sure I'll find it.

663
01:15:11,826 --> 01:15:13,728
Thank you very much,
Miss Stoke.

664
01:15:13,761 --> 01:15:15,263
I mean, Kelly.

665
01:15:16,164 --> 01:15:17,866
Thank you, Kelly.

666
01:15:19,367 --> 01:15:21,069
See you tomorrow.

667
01:16:44,286 --> 01:16:46,321
I thought this piece here.

668
01:16:47,422 --> 01:16:48,856
It really has something.

669
01:16:48,890 --> 01:16:50,825
I'm, I'm sure it's never
been used in a funeral before.

670
01:16:50,858 --> 01:16:53,695
But you'll see... I mean,
you'll hear when you hear it.

671
01:16:53,728 --> 01:16:54,963
Next Friday.

672
01:16:54,997 --> 01:16:56,231
And...
And...

673
01:16:56,264 --> 01:16:58,000
Uh, uh, yes, the memorial.

674
01:16:58,033 --> 01:16:59,601
They call it red granite,

675
01:16:59,634 --> 01:17:00,735
but it's not red,

676
01:17:00,768 --> 01:17:02,070
it's darker, more maroon.

677
01:17:02,104 --> 01:17:04,472
It's like the color of
his beret in the army.

678
01:17:04,506 --> 01:17:06,441
I thought your father
would have liked that.

679
01:17:06,474 --> 01:17:07,609
And the place.

680
01:17:07,642 --> 01:17:09,777
I really hope you like it.
It's...

681
01:17:09,811 --> 01:17:12,214
Well, on a good day,
you can see for miles.

682
01:17:12,247 --> 01:17:13,515
And even when the weather's
not that great,

683
01:17:13,548 --> 01:17:15,550
it's so open,
you really feel you're...

684
01:17:15,583 --> 01:17:17,485
You really feel you're...
I mean, he is...

685
01:17:17,519 --> 01:17:21,189
He's, he's outside.
He's not inside, not under.

686
01:17:37,472 --> 01:17:40,742
I was thinking next Friday
after the service,

687
01:17:40,775 --> 01:17:44,912
maybe we could go somewhere
for a cup of tea or chocolate.

688
01:17:46,014 --> 01:17:47,815
Just to, you know,
just to, just to chat.

689
01:17:47,849 --> 01:17:50,852
If you have time,
of course. If you...

690
01:17:50,885 --> 01:17:51,953
Yes.

691
01:17:53,355 --> 01:17:55,690
Yes, I would like
that very much.

692
01:17:58,526 --> 01:18:01,696
Just a cup of something.

693
01:18:02,530 --> 01:18:04,266
And I do have time.

694
01:18:05,167 --> 01:18:06,968
I have lots of time.

695
01:18:10,272 --> 01:18:12,740
See you there, then, John.

696
01:18:15,077 --> 01:18:17,179
And thank you.

697
01:18:17,212 --> 01:18:19,681
Thank you for everything
you've done.

698
01:18:21,083 --> 01:18:22,317
No need.

699
01:18:23,518 --> 01:18:24,786
It was...

700
01:18:28,022 --> 01:18:29,591
Just my job.

701
01:24:15,637 --> 01:24:16,704
Good-bye, mate.
