00:02:37,084 --> 00:02:39,701
The hills are alive

3
00:02:39,996 --> 00:02:44,184
With the sound of music

4
00:02:44,442 --> 00:02:46,775
With songs they have sung

5
00:02:47,065 --> 00:02:51,701
For a thousand years

6
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,992
The hills fill my heart

7
00:02:55,222 --> 00:02:59,564
With the sound of music

8
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:06,702
My heart wants to sing
Every song it hears

9
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:11,855
My heart wants to beat like the wings
Of the birds that rise

10
00:03:12,114 --> 00:03:15,048
From the lake to the trees

11
00:03:15,249 --> 00:03:19,373
My heart wants to sigh
Like a chime that flies

12
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:23,407
From a church on a breeze

13
00:03:23,664 --> 00:03:27,011
To laugh like a brook
When it trips and falls

14
00:03:27,246 --> 00:03:30,594
Over stones on its way

15
00:03:30,861 --> 00:03:34,571
To sing through the night

16
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:38,438
Like a lark who is learning to pray

17
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:44,162
I go to the hills

18
00:03:44,361 --> 00:03:50,273
When my heart is lonely

19
00:03:50,535 --> 00:03:54,244
I know I will hear

20
00:03:54,437 --> 00:03:58,747
What I've heard before

21
00:03:59,012 --> 00:04:03,552
My heart will be blessed

22
00:04:03,781 --> 00:04:11,230
With the sound of music

23
00:04:12,257 --> 00:04:17,209
And I'll sing...

24
00:04:17,408 --> 00:04:26,004
...once more

25
00:08:56,439 --> 00:09:01,192
Hallelujah, hallelujah

26
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,931
Hallelujah, hallelujah

27
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:10,024
- Reverend Mother.
- Sister Bernice.

28
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,778
- I simply cannot find her.
- Maria?

29
00:09:13,808 --> 00:09:15,052
She's missing again.

30
00:09:15,951 --> 00:09:18,221
We should've put a cowbell
around her neck.

31
00:09:18,447 --> 00:09:21,382
Have you tried the barn? You know
how much she adores the animals.

32
00:09:21,647 --> 00:09:24,264
I have looked everywhere.
In all of the usual places.

33
00:09:24,461 --> 00:09:26,600
Sister, considering it's Maria...

34
00:09:26,894 --> 00:09:29,379
...I suggest you look in someplace
unusual.

35
00:09:34,443 --> 00:09:35,688
Well, Reverend Mother...

36
00:09:35,947 --> 00:09:38,402
...I hope this new infraction ends
whatever doubts...

37
00:09:38,665 --> 00:09:41,764
...you may still have
about Maria's future here.

38
00:09:41,961 --> 00:09:45,856
I always try to keep faith
in my doubts, Sister Berthe.

39
00:09:46,088 --> 00:09:48,837
After all, the wool of a black sheep
is just as warm.

40
00:09:49,063 --> 00:09:53,219
We are not talking about sheep,
black or white, Sister Margaretta.

41
00:09:53,446 --> 00:09:56,741
Of all the candidates for
the novitiate, Maria is the least...

42
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:59,384
Children, children.

43
00:09:59,844 --> 00:10:03,640
We were speculating about
the qualifications of our postulants.

44
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,129
The Mistress of Novices
and the Mistress of Postulants...

45
00:10:07,362 --> 00:10:12,445
...were trying to help me
by expressing opposite points of view.

46
00:10:12,672 --> 00:10:15,607
Tell me, Sister Catherine,
what do you think of Maria?

47
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:18,742
She's a wonderful girl,
some of the time.

48
00:10:19,678 --> 00:10:22,647
- Sister Agatha?
- It's very easy to like Maria...

49
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,300
...except when it's difficult.

50
00:10:25,598 --> 00:10:29,011
- And you, Sister Sophia?
- Oh, I love her very dearly.

51
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:32,026
But she always seems to be
in trouble, doesn't she?

52
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,777
Exactly what I say.

53
00:10:34,236 --> 00:10:36,602
She climbs a tree and scrapes her knee

54
00:10:36,795 --> 00:10:38,420
Her dress has got a tear

55
00:10:39,066 --> 00:10:43,057
She waltzes on her way to Mass
And whistles on the stair

56
00:10:43,673 --> 00:10:47,981
And underneath her wimple
She has curlers in her hair

57
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:52,654
I've even heard her singing
In the abbey

58
00:10:52,887 --> 00:10:54,796
She's always late for chapel

59
00:10:55,031 --> 00:10:57,200
But her penitence is real

60
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,696
She's always late for everything

61
00:10:59,924 --> 00:11:01,866
Except for every meal

62
00:11:02,226 --> 00:11:06,732
I hate to have to say it
But I very firmly feel

63
00:11:06,963 --> 00:11:11,216
Maria's not an asset to the abbey

64
00:11:11,698 --> 00:11:14,085
I'd like to say a word in her behalf

65
00:11:14,352 --> 00:11:15,629
Say it, Sister Margaretta.

66
00:11:16,463 --> 00:11:20,260
Maria makes me laugh

67
00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:26,795
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

68
00:11:27,052 --> 00:11:30,697
How do you catch a cloud
And pin it down?

69
00:11:30,988 --> 00:11:34,185
How do you find a word
That means Maria?

70
00:11:34,698 --> 00:11:35,746
A flibbertigibbet

71
00:11:35,979 --> 00:11:37,255
- A will-o'-the-wisp
- A clown

72
00:11:38,826 --> 00:11:42,401
Many a thing you know
You'd like to tell her

73
00:11:42,663 --> 00:11:45,978
Many a thing she ought to understand

74
00:11:46,376 --> 00:11:49,921
But how do you make her stay
And listen to all you say?

75
00:11:50,471 --> 00:11:53,817
How do you keep a wave upon the sand?

76
00:11:54,053 --> 00:11:57,980
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

77
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:03,770
How do you hold a moonbeam...

78
00:12:03,972 --> 00:12:09,207
...in your hand?

79
00:12:10,242 --> 00:12:13,590
When I'm with her I'm confused
Out of focus and bemused

80
00:12:13,887 --> 00:12:17,183
And I never know exactly where I am

81
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:20,572
- Unpredictable as weather
- She's as flighty as a feather

82
00:12:20,927 --> 00:12:22,681
- She's a darling
- She's a demon

83
00:12:22,878 --> 00:12:24,153
She's a lamb

84
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:28,051
She'll out pester any pest
Drive a hornet from its nest

85
00:12:28,252 --> 00:12:31,415
She can throw a whirling dervish
Out of whirl

86
00:12:31,964 --> 00:12:35,345
- She is gentle, she is wild
- She's a riddle, she's a child

87
00:12:35,898 --> 00:12:38,352
- She's a headache
- She's an angel

88
00:12:38,552 --> 00:12:42,294
She's a girl

89
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,775
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

90
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,544
How do you catch a cloud
And pin it down?

91
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,185
How do you find a word
That means Maria?

92
00:12:54,453 --> 00:12:56,362
- A flibbertigibbet
- A will-o'-the-wisp

93
00:12:56,597 --> 00:12:58,156
A clown

94
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:02,190
Many a thing you know
You'd like to tell her

95
00:13:02,452 --> 00:13:05,799
Many a thing she ought to understand

96
00:13:06,003 --> 00:13:10,158
- But how do you make her stay
- And listen to all you say?

97
00:13:10,386 --> 00:13:14,313
How do you keep a wave upon the sand?

98
00:13:14,512 --> 00:13:20,108
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

99
00:13:35,402 --> 00:13:41,893
How do you hold a moonbeam...

100
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:48,902
...in your hand?

101
00:14:00,229 --> 00:14:02,136
You may go in now, Maria.

102
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:15,768
Come here, my child.

103
00:14:22,014 --> 00:14:23,321
Now sit down.

104
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,635
Reverend Mother, I'm sorry.
I couldn't help myself.

105
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,746
- The hills were beckoning and before...
- Dear.

106
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,018
I haven't summoned you for apologies.

107
00:14:33,243 --> 00:14:35,381
Please let me ask for forgiveness.

108
00:14:36,025 --> 00:14:37,203
If you'll feel better.

109
00:14:38,104 --> 00:14:40,374
Yes, you see,
the sky was so blue today...

110
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,244
...and everything was so green and
fragrant, I had to be a part of it.

111
00:14:44,505 --> 00:14:48,813
The Untersberg led me higher like
it wanted me to go through the clouds.

112
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,956
Suppose darkness had come
and you were lost?

113
00:14:51,221 --> 00:14:53,360
Mother, I could never be lost
up there.

114
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,338
That's my mountain.
I was brought up on it.

115
00:14:56,532 --> 00:14:58,736
It was the mountain that led me
to you.

116
00:14:59,476 --> 00:15:02,322
When I was a child,
I would come down and climb a tree...

117
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:04,268
...and look in your garden.

118
00:15:04,498 --> 00:15:07,313
I'd see the sisters at work
and hear them sing.

119
00:15:08,593 --> 00:15:12,073
Which brings me to another
transgression, Reverend Mother.

120
00:15:12,272 --> 00:15:14,345
I was singing out there today.

121
00:15:14,992 --> 00:15:18,853
Only in the abbey do we have rules
about postulants singing.

122
00:15:19,054 --> 00:15:20,995
I can't stop wherever I am.

123
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:23,432
Worse, I can't seem to stop
saying things.

124
00:15:23,693 --> 00:15:25,865
Everything I think and feel.

125
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,466
Some call that "honesty."

126
00:15:27,724 --> 00:15:29,993
Oh, but it's terrible,
Reverend Mother!

127
00:15:30,188 --> 00:15:33,928
You know how Sister Berthe makes me
kiss the floor after a disagreement?

128
00:15:34,282 --> 00:15:37,631
Lately, I kiss the floor
when I see her coming to save time.

129
00:15:40,202 --> 00:15:41,314
Maria...

130
00:15:42,281 --> 00:15:45,150
...when you saw us over the wall
and longed to be with us...

131
00:15:45,383 --> 00:15:49,920
...that didn't mean you were prepared
for the way we live here, did it?

132
00:15:51,205 --> 00:15:53,506
No, Mother, but I pray and I try.

133
00:15:53,701 --> 00:15:55,360
And I am learning. I really am.

134
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:58,141
What is the most important lesson
you have learned here?

135
00:15:58,788 --> 00:16:02,431
To find out what is the will of God
and do it wholeheartedly.

136
00:16:05,154 --> 00:16:06,233
Maria...

137
00:16:07,682 --> 00:16:10,332
...it seems to be God's will
that you leave us.

138
00:16:10,592 --> 00:16:12,021
- Leave?
- Only for a while.

139
00:16:12,512 --> 00:16:14,749
No, Mother!
Please don't send me away!

140
00:16:14,976 --> 00:16:19,066
This is where I belong. It's my home,
my family. It's my life.

141
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:22,612
- Are you truly ready for it?
- Yes, I am.

142
00:16:22,811 --> 00:16:27,514
If you go out into the world for a
time, knowing what we expect of you...

143
00:16:27,772 --> 00:16:30,389
...you will find out
if you can expect it of yourself.

144
00:16:30,586 --> 00:16:34,710
I know what you expect, Mother,
and I can do it! I promise I can!

145
00:16:38,106 --> 00:16:39,283
Yes, Mother.

146
00:16:41,305 --> 00:16:42,897
If it is God's will.

147
00:16:45,048 --> 00:16:49,965
There is a family near Salzburg that
needs a governess until September.

148
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:52,305
- September?
- For seven children.

149
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:53,898
Seven children?!

150
00:16:54,132 --> 00:16:55,342
Do you like children?

151
00:16:56,085 --> 00:16:57,839
Well, yes, but seven!

152
00:16:58,931 --> 00:17:01,963
I will tell Captain von Trapp
to expect you tomorrow.

153
00:17:02,482 --> 00:17:03,824
Captain?

154
00:17:04,498 --> 00:17:09,134
A retired officer of the Imperial
Navy. A fine man and a brave one.

155
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,979
His wife died,
and he is alone with the children.

156
00:17:12,176 --> 00:17:16,297
I understand he has had a difficult
time keeping a governess there.

157
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:19,242
Why difficult, Reverend Mother?

158
00:17:20,556 --> 00:17:23,371
The Lord will show you
in His own good time.

159
00:17:58,724 --> 00:18:01,090
When the Lord closes a door...

160
00:18:01,283 --> 00:18:03,705
...somewhere He opens a window.

161
00:18:05,954 --> 00:18:10,743
What will this day be like?

162
00:18:10,944 --> 00:18:13,082
I wonder

163
00:18:19,325 --> 00:18:23,253
What will my future be?

164
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,231
I wonder

165
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:30,706
It could be so exciting

166
00:18:30,907 --> 00:18:33,873
To be out in the world
To be free

167
00:18:34,073 --> 00:18:37,009
My heart should be wildly rejoicing

168
00:18:38,137 --> 00:18:43,252
Oh, what's the matter with me?

169
00:18:43,575 --> 00:18:46,509
I've always longed for adventure

170
00:18:46,773 --> 00:18:50,189
To do the things I've never dared

171
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:53,487
Now here I'm facing adventure

172
00:18:53,781 --> 00:18:59,628
Then why am I so scared?

173
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,713
A captain with seven children

174
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:08,653
What's so fearsome about that?

175
00:19:11,088 --> 00:19:13,607
I must stop these doubts and worries

176
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:16,586
If I don't I just know I'll turn back

177
00:19:16,845 --> 00:19:19,880
I must dream of the things
I am seeking

178
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:25,698
I am seeking the courage I lack

179
00:19:26,572 --> 00:19:30,248
The courage to serve them
With reliance

180
00:19:30,506 --> 00:19:33,290
Face my mistakes without defiance

181
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,171
Show them I'm worthy

182
00:19:35,403 --> 00:19:37,955
And while I show them

183
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:41,859
I'll show me

184
00:19:42,054 --> 00:19:47,237
So let them bring on
All their problems

185
00:19:47,462 --> 00:19:50,592
I'll do better than my best

186
00:19:50,853 --> 00:19:53,788
I have confidence
They'll put me to the test

187
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,315
But I'll make them see
I have confidence in me

188
00:19:57,538 --> 00:20:00,669
Somehow I will impress them

189
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:04,029
I will be firm but kind

190
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:07,453
And all those children
Heaven bless them

191
00:20:07,681 --> 00:20:10,844
They will look up to me
And mind me

192
00:20:11,071 --> 00:20:14,070
With each step I am more certain

193
00:20:14,334 --> 00:20:17,467
Everything will turn out fine

194
00:20:17,694 --> 00:20:20,660
I have confidence
The world can all be mine

195
00:20:20,894 --> 00:20:26,107
They'll have to agree
I have confidence in me

196
00:20:27,611 --> 00:20:30,229
I have confidence in sunshine

197
00:20:30,491 --> 00:20:33,457
I have confidence in rain

198
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,440
I have confidence
That spring will come again

199
00:20:36,731 --> 00:20:39,630
Besides which you see
I have confidence in me

200
00:20:39,927 --> 00:20:42,861
Strength doesn't lie in numbers

201
00:20:43,126 --> 00:20:46,029
Strength doesn't lie in wealth

202
00:20:46,263 --> 00:20:49,458
Strength lies in nights
Of peaceful slumbers

203
00:20:49,717 --> 00:20:52,466
When you wake up, wake up
It's healthy

204
00:20:52,756 --> 00:20:55,625
All I trust I leave my heart to

205
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,640
All I trust becomes my own

206
00:20:58,834 --> 00:21:03,438
I have confidence in confidence alone

207
00:21:17,454 --> 00:21:19,013
Oh, help.

208
00:21:30,699 --> 00:21:37,090
I have confidence in confidence alone

209
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:42,466
Besides which you see
I have confidence...

210
00:21:42,726 --> 00:21:49,249
...in me

211
00:21:55,524 --> 00:21:57,826
Hello. Here I am.

212
00:22:00,547 --> 00:22:02,303
I'm from the convent.
I'm the new governess, captain.

213
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:07,003
And I'm the old butler, fraulein.

214
00:22:08,895 --> 00:22:10,619
Well, how do you do?

215
00:22:20,701 --> 00:22:24,594
You'll wait here, please.

216
00:23:47,398 --> 00:23:51,325
In future, remember certain rooms
in this house are not to be disturbed.

217
00:23:52,452 --> 00:23:53,859
Yes, captain, sir.

218
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:06,490
- Why do you stare at me that way?
- You don't look like a sea captain.

219
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:10,582
I'm afraid you don't look
very much like a governess.

220
00:24:11,263 --> 00:24:12,277
- Turn around.
- What?

221
00:24:12,606 --> 00:24:13,817
Turn.

222
00:24:16,862 --> 00:24:17,974
Hat off.

223
00:24:21,054 --> 00:24:23,574
Put on another dress
before meeting the children.

224
00:24:23,868 --> 00:24:25,363
But I don't have another.

225
00:24:25,627 --> 00:24:28,376
When we enter the abbey,
our worldly clothes go to the poor.

226
00:24:28,603 --> 00:24:29,813
What about this one?

227
00:24:30,009 --> 00:24:31,285
The poor didn't want it.

228
00:24:33,048 --> 00:24:36,396
There wasn't time to make a new dress.
I can make clothes.

229
00:24:37,624 --> 00:24:39,796
I'll see that you get some material.

230
00:24:40,504 --> 00:24:41,965
Today, if possible.

231
00:24:42,903 --> 00:24:44,593
- Now, fraulein...
- Maria.

232
00:24:44,821 --> 00:24:47,440
I don't know how much
the abbess told you.

233
00:24:47,702 --> 00:24:50,155
You are the twelfth governess...

234
00:24:50,357 --> 00:24:52,724
...to look after my children
since their mother died.

235
00:24:52,917 --> 00:24:55,056
I trust you will be an improvement
on the last one.

236
00:24:55,284 --> 00:24:57,038
She stayed only two hours.

237
00:24:58,676 --> 00:25:01,161
What's wrong with the children, sir?

238
00:25:02,577 --> 00:25:06,798
Nothing is wrong with the children,
only the governesses.

239
00:25:07,056 --> 00:25:11,790
They could not maintain discipline,
without which the house cannot be run.

240
00:25:12,685 --> 00:25:14,409
Drill them in their studies.

241
00:25:14,637 --> 00:25:17,985
I will not permit them to dream
away their summer holidays.

242
00:25:18,252 --> 00:25:20,837
Each afternoon,
they march, breathing deeply.

243
00:25:21,036 --> 00:25:22,629
Bedtime is to be strictly observed.

244
00:25:22,828 --> 00:25:23,757
When do they play?

245
00:25:23,949 --> 00:25:27,842
You will see to it that they conduct
themselves with the utmost decorum.

246
00:25:28,075 --> 00:25:30,888
- I am placing you in command.
- Yes, sir.

247
00:26:48,212 --> 00:26:49,325
Now...

248
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:52,723
...this is your new governess,
Fraulein Maria.

249
00:26:54,323 --> 00:26:56,231
Give your name at your signal.

250
00:26:56,531 --> 00:27:00,555
Fraulein, listen carefully. Learn
their signals so you can call them.

251
00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:03,116
Liesl.

252
00:27:03,376 --> 00:27:05,035
Friedrich.

253
00:27:05,297 --> 00:27:06,757
Louisa.

254
00:27:07,024 --> 00:27:08,233
Kurt.

255
00:27:08,463 --> 00:27:09,478
Brigitta.

256
00:27:09,743 --> 00:27:10,919
Marta.

257
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:18,314
Gretl.

258
00:27:22,764 --> 00:27:26,057
Now, let's see how well you listened.

259
00:27:26,281 --> 00:27:28,551
I won't need to whistle for them,
Reverend Captain.

260
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:32,126
I mean, I'll use their names.
Such lovely names.

261
00:27:32,329 --> 00:27:35,362
Fraulein, this is a large house.
The grounds are extensive.

262
00:27:35,592 --> 00:27:38,242
And I will not have anyone shouting.

263
00:27:38,471 --> 00:27:40,130
You will take this, please.
Learn to use it.

264
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:41,920
The children will help you.

265
00:27:43,877 --> 00:27:47,706
Now, when I want you,
this is what you will hear.

266
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:50,272
Oh, no, sir. I'm sorry, sir!

267
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:52,601
I could never answer to a whistle.

268
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:55,322
Whistles are for animals,
not for children.

269
00:27:55,586 --> 00:27:57,561
And definitely not for me.

270
00:27:57,793 --> 00:28:00,313
It would be too humiliating.

271
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:06,074
Fraulein, were you this much trouble
at the abbey?

272
00:28:06,369 --> 00:28:07,414
Oh, much more, sir.

273
00:28:18,076 --> 00:28:19,571
I don't know your signal.

274
00:28:20,989 --> 00:28:23,507
You may call me "captain."

275
00:28:35,897 --> 00:28:37,302
At ease.

276
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,483
Now that there's just us...

277
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:45,744
...would you please tell me all your
names again and how old you are.

278
00:28:46,198 --> 00:28:50,027
I'm Liesl. I'm 16 years old,
and I don't need a governess.

279
00:28:50,773 --> 00:28:53,705
I'm glad you told me, Liesl.
We'll just be good friends.

280
00:28:55,793 --> 00:28:59,405
I'm Friedrich. I'm 14.
I'm impossible.

281
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:01,291
Really? Who told you that, Friedrich?

282
00:29:01,554 --> 00:29:04,902
Fraulein Josephine.
Four governesses ago.

283
00:29:05,328 --> 00:29:06,734
I'm Brigitta.

284
00:29:08,494 --> 00:29:12,323
You didn't tell me how old you are,
Louisa.

285
00:29:12,974 --> 00:29:15,146
I'm Brigitta. She's Louisa.

286
00:29:15,374 --> 00:29:18,024
She's 13 years old, and you're smart.

287
00:29:18,252 --> 00:29:21,862
I'm 10, and I think your dress
is the ugliest one I ever saw.

288
00:29:22,187 --> 00:29:24,706
- Brigitta, you shouldn't say that.
- Why not?

289
00:29:24,907 --> 00:29:27,076
- Don't you think it's ugly?
- Of course.

290
00:29:27,337 --> 00:29:29,922
But Fraulein Helga's was ugliest.

291
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:32,673
I'm Kurt. I'm 11.
I'm incorrigible.

292
00:29:32,936 --> 00:29:35,936
- Congratulations.
- What's "incorrigible"?

293
00:29:36,168 --> 00:29:39,875
I think it means you want
to be treated like a boy.

294
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:45,121
I'm Marta, and I'm going to be
seven on Tuesday.

295
00:29:45,381 --> 00:29:46,691
I'd like a pink parasol.

296
00:29:47,844 --> 00:29:49,306
Pink's my favorite color too.

297
00:29:51,618 --> 00:29:52,731
Yes, you're Gretl.

298
00:29:53,603 --> 00:29:55,227
And you're five years old?

299
00:29:55,649 --> 00:29:57,559
My, you're practically a lady.

300
00:29:59,969 --> 00:30:02,870
I have to tell you a secret.
I've never been a governess.

301
00:30:04,257 --> 00:30:06,906
You don't know anything
about being a governess?

302
00:30:07,167 --> 00:30:08,476
Nothing. I'll need lots of advice.

303
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:13,748
The best way to start is to tell
Father to mind his own business.

304
00:30:13,949 --> 00:30:15,672
Never come to dinner on time.

305
00:30:15,869 --> 00:30:18,072
Never eat your soup quietly.

306
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:20,723
During dessert, always blow your nose.

307
00:30:20,955 --> 00:30:23,638
Don't you believe a word they say,
Fraulein Maria.

308
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:27,062
- Oh, why not?
- Because I like you.

309
00:30:27,835 --> 00:30:29,742
Children, outside for your walk.

310
00:30:29,945 --> 00:30:31,767
Father's orders. Hurry up.

311
00:30:31,961 --> 00:30:33,204
Quick, quick, quick.

312
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:36,498
Fraulein Maria, I'm Frau Schmidt,
the housekeeper.

313
00:30:36,726 --> 00:30:37,740
How do you do.

314
00:30:37,942 --> 00:30:40,723
I'll show you to your room.
Follow me.

315
00:30:51,347 --> 00:30:53,037
Poor little dears.

316
00:31:05,232 --> 00:31:09,420
You're very lucky. With
Fraulein Helga it was a snake.

317
00:31:22,699 --> 00:31:23,974
Good evening.

318
00:31:25,354 --> 00:31:28,769
- Good evening, children.
- Good evening, Fraulein Maria.

319
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:37,247
Enchanting little ritual.

320
00:31:37,446 --> 00:31:40,064
Something you learned at the abbey?

321
00:31:41,224 --> 00:31:43,459
No.

322
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:46,239
Rheumatism.

323
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:58,682
Excuse me, captain. Haven't we
forgotten to thank the Lord?

324
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,406
For what we receive,
may the Lord make us truly thankful.

325
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,774
- Amen.
- Amen.

326
00:32:16,125 --> 00:32:17,978
I'd like to thank you all...

327
00:32:18,171 --> 00:32:21,040
...for the precious gift
you left in my pocket today.

328
00:32:24,411 --> 00:32:26,134
What gift?

329
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,186
It's a secret between
the children and me.

330
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:34,927
Then I suggest you keep it,
and let us eat.

331
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:37,173
Knowing how nervous
I must have been...

332
00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:39,734
...a stranger in a new household...

333
00:32:39,926 --> 00:32:42,860
...knowing how important it was
for me to feel accepted...

334
00:32:43,126 --> 00:32:47,149
...it was so kind and thoughtful of
you to make my first moments here...

335
00:32:47,411 --> 00:32:49,516
...so warm and happy...

336
00:32:49,715 --> 00:32:51,404
...and pleasant.

337
00:33:00,273 --> 00:33:02,214
- What is the matter, Marta?
- Nothing.

338
00:33:14,124 --> 00:33:15,105
Fraulein...

339
00:33:15,339 --> 00:33:19,016
...is it to be at every meal
or merely at dinnertime...

340
00:33:19,243 --> 00:33:23,618
...that you intend leading us through
this rare and wonderful new world...

341
00:33:23,819 --> 00:33:25,411
...of indigestion?

342
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:29,670
They're all right, captain.
They're just happy.

343
00:33:47,652 --> 00:33:50,204
- Rolfe, good evening.
- Good evening, Franz.

344
00:33:50,467 --> 00:33:53,085
- I trust everything is under control?
- Yes, yes.

345
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:56,991
- Are there any developments?
- Perhaps.

346
00:33:57,185 --> 00:33:59,256
- Is the captain home?
- He's at dinner.

347
00:33:59,488 --> 00:34:01,725
- With the family?
- Yes.

348
00:34:01,983 --> 00:34:03,706
Give him this telegram at once.

349
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,464
Certainly.

350
00:34:16,667 --> 00:34:18,293
A telegram for you, sir.

351
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:22,775
Franz? Who delivered it?

352
00:34:23,066 --> 00:34:25,008
That young lad Rolfe, of course.

353
00:34:27,257 --> 00:34:28,915
Father, may I be excused?

354
00:34:29,848 --> 00:34:34,125
Children, in the morning I shall
be going to Vienna.

355
00:34:34,424 --> 00:34:36,758
Not again, Father!

356
00:34:40,501 --> 00:34:42,475
How long will you be gone this time?

357
00:34:43,092 --> 00:34:44,499
I'm not sure, Gretl.

358
00:34:44,691 --> 00:34:48,105
- To visit Baroness Schraeder again?
- Mind your own business!

359
00:34:49,042 --> 00:34:50,897
As a matter of fact, yes, Louisa.

360
00:34:52,594 --> 00:34:56,270
- Why can't we ever see the baroness?
- Why would she want to see you?

361
00:34:56,562 --> 00:35:01,230
You are going to see the baroness.
I'm bringing her back with me to visit.

362
00:35:02,671 --> 00:35:04,396
And Uncle Max.

363
00:35:04,656 --> 00:35:06,956
Uncle Max!

364
00:35:22,346 --> 00:35:23,623
Rolfe!

365
00:35:26,569 --> 00:35:27,583
Oh, Rolfe!

366
00:35:30,024 --> 00:35:32,839
- No, Liesl. We mustn't!
- Why not, silly?

367
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:35,616
- I don't know...
- Isn't this why you're waiting?

368
00:35:35,847 --> 00:35:37,636
Yes, of course.

369
00:35:37,832 --> 00:35:40,512
- I've missed you, Liesl.
- You have? How much?

370
00:35:40,741 --> 00:35:44,416
I even thought of sending a telegram,
so I'd be able to deliver it here.

371
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:48,417
Oh, that's a lovely thought!
Why don't you, right now?

372
00:35:48,675 --> 00:35:52,669
- But I'm here!
- Please, Rolfe. Send me a telegram.

373
00:35:52,866 --> 00:35:56,182
I'll start it for you.
"Dear Liesl..."

374
00:35:56,833 --> 00:36:00,312
"Dear Liesl: I'd like to be able
to tell you...

375
00:36:00,545 --> 00:36:02,649
...how I feel about you. Stop.

376
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,222
Unfortunately, this wire
is already too expensive.

377
00:36:07,423 --> 00:36:08,798
Sincerely, Rolfe."

378
00:36:08,991 --> 00:36:11,640
- "Sincerely"?
- Cordially.

379
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:14,389
- "Cordially"?
- Affectionately?

380
00:36:16,669 --> 00:36:18,609
Will there be any reply?

381
00:36:19,835 --> 00:36:21,907
"Dear Rolfe: Stop.

382
00:36:22,874 --> 00:36:25,841
Don't stop! Your Liesl."

383
00:36:27,514 --> 00:36:31,189
If only we didn't have to wait
for someone to send Father a telegram.

384
00:36:31,448 --> 00:36:33,750
How do I know when I'll see you again?

385
00:36:34,616 --> 00:36:35,759
Well, let's see...

386
00:36:38,646 --> 00:36:40,533
I could come here by mistake.

387
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:45,933
With a telegram for Colonel Schneider!
He's here from Berlin staying with...

388
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:49,967
No one knows he's here.
Don't tell your father.

389
00:36:50,228 --> 00:36:53,259
- Why not?
- Your father's so Austrian.

390
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:54,701
We're all Austrian.

391
00:36:54,897 --> 00:36:59,118
Some think we ought to be German, and
they're very mad at those who don't.

392
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:01,036
They're getting ready to...

393
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:04,975
Let's hope your father
doesn't get into trouble.

394
00:37:05,263 --> 00:37:09,963
Don't worry. He's a big naval hero.
He was even decorated by the emperor.

395
00:37:10,157 --> 00:37:13,286
I don't worry about him.
I worry about his daughter.

396
00:37:13,805 --> 00:37:15,212
Me? Why?

397
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,994
- Well, you're so...
- What?

398
00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:18,848
You're such a baby!

399
00:37:19,275 --> 00:37:22,056
I'm 16.
What's such a baby about that?

400
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:27,584
You wait, little girl
On an empty stage

401
00:37:27,817 --> 00:37:31,046
For fate to turn the light on

402
00:37:31,655 --> 00:37:34,754
Your life, little girl
Is an empty page

403
00:37:35,016 --> 00:37:38,908
That men will want to write on

404
00:37:39,588 --> 00:37:44,858
To write on

405
00:37:45,765 --> 00:37:49,538
You are 16 going on 17

406
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:53,407
Baby, it's time to think

407
00:37:53,602 --> 00:37:57,081
Better beware
Be canny and careful

408
00:37:57,313 --> 00:38:00,793
Baby, you're on the brink

409
00:38:01,121 --> 00:38:04,796
You are 16 going on 17

410
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:08,502
Fellows will fall in line

411
00:38:08,797 --> 00:38:11,993
Eager young lads
And roues and cads

412
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:15,962
Will offer you food and wine

413
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:19,831
Totally unprepared are you

414
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:23,633
To face a world of men

415
00:38:24,184 --> 00:38:28,178
Timid and shy and scared are you

416
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:31,820
Of things beyond your ken

417
00:38:32,023 --> 00:38:35,731
You need someone older and wiser

418
00:38:35,958 --> 00:38:39,665
Telling you what to do

419
00:38:39,892 --> 00:38:43,187
I am 17 going on 18

420
00:38:43,413 --> 00:38:49,128
I'll take care of you

421
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:23,526
I am 16 going on 17

422
00:39:23,722 --> 00:39:26,983
I know that I'm naive

423
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:30,339
Fellows I meet
May tell me I'm sweet

424
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:34,112
And willingly I believe

425
00:39:34,566 --> 00:39:37,598
I am 16 going on 17

426
00:39:37,797 --> 00:39:41,409
Innocent as a rose

427
00:39:41,605 --> 00:39:44,921
Bachelor dandies
Drinkers of brandies

428
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:48,416
What do I know of those?

429
00:39:48,611 --> 00:39:51,992
Totally unprepared am I

430
00:39:52,258 --> 00:39:55,606
To face a world of men

431
00:39:56,002 --> 00:39:59,197
Timid and shy and scared am I

432
00:39:59,457 --> 00:40:02,967
Of things beyond my ken

433
00:40:03,389 --> 00:40:06,837
I need someone older and wiser

434
00:40:07,069 --> 00:40:10,233
Telling me what to do

435
00:40:10,556 --> 00:40:14,101
You are 17 going on 18

436
00:40:14,332 --> 00:40:19,765
I'll depend on you

437
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:09,530
Come in.

438
00:42:10,525 --> 00:42:12,084
Frau Schmidt.

439
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:15,990
For your new dresses.

440
00:42:16,282 --> 00:42:20,110
- The captain had these sent from town.
- Oh, how lovely!

441
00:42:20,379 --> 00:42:23,672
These will make the prettiest
clothes I've ever had.

442
00:42:23,929 --> 00:42:27,278
Do you think he would
get me more material if I asked?

443
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:30,991
- How many dresses do you need?
- Not for me, for the children.

444
00:42:31,254 --> 00:42:33,228
I want to make them some play clothes.

445
00:42:33,495 --> 00:42:36,877
The von Trapp children don't play.
They march.

446
00:42:37,365 --> 00:42:39,666
Surely you don't approve of that.

447
00:42:40,627 --> 00:42:42,929
Ever since the captain
lost his poor wife...

448
00:42:43,154 --> 00:42:45,740
...he runs this house as if on
one of his ships.

449
00:42:46,546 --> 00:42:47,888
Whistles, orders.

450
00:42:48,147 --> 00:42:49,903
No more music, no more laughing.

451
00:42:50,162 --> 00:42:53,544
Nothing that reminds him of her.
Even the children.

452
00:42:54,033 --> 00:42:55,081
But that's so wrong.

453
00:42:55,889 --> 00:42:57,348
Oh, well.

454
00:42:57,551 --> 00:43:01,062
How do you like your room?
There'll be new drapes at the windows.

455
00:43:01,326 --> 00:43:02,536
Bu these are fine.

456
00:43:02,766 --> 00:43:04,359
New ones have been ordered.

457
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:07,722
- But I really don't need them.
- Good night, now.

458
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:11,811
Frau Schmidt, if I asked
the captain about the material?

459
00:43:12,076 --> 00:43:16,351
- He's leaving in the morning.
- Of course. How long will he be gone?

460
00:43:16,906 --> 00:43:21,314
It depends. The last time he visited
the baroness, he stayed for a month.

461
00:43:22,442 --> 00:43:26,815
I shouldn't be saying this to you.
I don't know you that well.

462
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,861
But if you ask me,
the captain's thinking seriously...

463
00:43:30,055 --> 00:43:32,257
...of marrying her before
summer's over.

464
00:43:32,453 --> 00:43:35,551
Wonderful! The children will
have a mother again.

465
00:43:36,934 --> 00:43:38,177
Yes.

466
00:43:38,436 --> 00:43:40,094
Well, good night.

467
00:43:40,292 --> 00:43:41,666
Good night.

468
00:43:59,347 --> 00:44:02,065
Dear Father, now I know
why You sent me here.

469
00:44:02,293 --> 00:44:05,044
To help these children
prepare for a new mother.

470
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:08,436
And I pray this will become
a happy family in Thy sight.

471
00:44:08,633 --> 00:44:11,634
God bless the captain.
God bless Liesl and Friedrich.

472
00:44:11,835 --> 00:44:15,830
God bless Louisa, Brigitta,
Marta and little Gretl.

473
00:44:16,127 --> 00:44:18,845
And I forgot the other boy.
What's his name?

474
00:44:20,544 --> 00:44:22,301
Well, God bless what's-his-name.

475
00:44:22,498 --> 00:44:26,327
God bless the Reverend Mother
and Sister Margaretta...

476
00:44:26,531 --> 00:44:28,256
...and everybody at the abbey.

477
00:44:28,454 --> 00:44:30,876
And now, dear God, about Liesl.

478
00:44:31,366 --> 00:44:33,188
Help her know that I'm her friend...

479
00:44:33,383 --> 00:44:35,840
...and help her tell me
what she's been up to.

480
00:44:36,552 --> 00:44:37,666
Are you going to tell on me?

481
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:41,196
Help me to be understanding
so I may guide her footsteps.

482
00:44:41,453 --> 00:44:43,975
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

483
00:44:44,174 --> 00:44:47,046
I was out walking
and somebody locked the doors early.

484
00:44:47,345 --> 00:44:50,825
I didn't want to wake everybody,
so when I saw your window open...

485
00:44:52,402 --> 00:44:55,306
You're not going to tell Father,
are you?

486
00:45:01,144 --> 00:45:02,388
How did you climb up?

487
00:45:02,873 --> 00:45:05,874
It's how we always got in
to play tricks on the governess.

488
00:45:06,076 --> 00:45:08,946
Louisa can make it with
a whole jar of spiders in her hand.

489
00:45:09,917 --> 00:45:11,512
Spiders?

490
00:45:15,073 --> 00:45:17,595
Were you out walking all by yourself?

491
00:45:24,774 --> 00:45:28,321
If we wash that dress tonight,
nobody would notice it tomorrow.

492
00:45:28,969 --> 00:45:30,661
You could put this on.

493
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:34,917
Take your dress and put it
to soak in the bathtub.

494
00:45:35,148 --> 00:45:38,531
Come back here and sit on the bed,
and we'll have a talk.

495
00:45:39,792 --> 00:45:42,693
I told you today
I didn't need a governess.

496
00:45:42,897 --> 00:45:44,905
Well, maybe I do.

497
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:16,604
Gretl, are you scared?

498
00:46:19,974 --> 00:46:22,147
You're not frightened
of a storm, are you?

499
00:46:22,376 --> 00:46:24,549
You just stay right here with me.

500
00:46:25,673 --> 00:46:29,735
- Where are the others?
- They're asleep. They're not scared.

501
00:46:33,966 --> 00:46:35,724
Oh, no? Look.

502
00:46:37,201 --> 00:46:39,089
All right, up here on the bed.

503
00:46:39,377 --> 00:46:41,965
- Really?
- Well, just this once. Come on.

504
00:46:43,028 --> 00:46:47,186
- Now we'll wait for the boys.
- You won't see them. Boys are brave.

505
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:54,743
You weren't scared, were you?

506
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:58,327
Oh, no. We just wanted
to be sure that you weren't.

507
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:02,293
- That's very thoughtful of you.
- It wasn't my idea.

508
00:47:02,591 --> 00:47:04,348
It was Kurt's!

509
00:47:04,577 --> 00:47:07,065
Kurt! That's the one I left out!
God bless Kurt.

510
00:47:09,764 --> 00:47:11,456
Why does it do that?

511
00:47:11,686 --> 00:47:15,364
The lightning talks to the thunder,
and the thunder answers.

512
00:47:15,591 --> 00:47:17,983
- But lightning must be nasty.
- Not really.

513
00:47:18,248 --> 00:47:20,421
Why does the thunder get so angry?

514
00:47:20,682 --> 00:47:22,725
It makes me want to cry.

515
00:47:24,525 --> 00:47:28,553
Whenever I'm feeling unhappy,
I just try to think of nice things.

516
00:47:28,751 --> 00:47:30,507
What kind of things?

517
00:47:31,248 --> 00:47:33,137
Well, let me see. Nice things...

518
00:47:33,363 --> 00:47:34,409
Daffodils.

519
00:47:35,635 --> 00:47:36,976
Green meadows.

520
00:47:37,365 --> 00:47:39,537
Skies full of stars.

521
00:47:39,735 --> 00:47:42,802
Raindrops on roses
and whiskers on kittens

522
00:47:42,999 --> 00:47:46,003
Bright copper kettles
And warm woolen mittens

523
00:47:46,202 --> 00:47:49,238
Brown paper packages
Tied up with strings

524
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,330
These are a few of my favorite things

525
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:58,490
Cream-colored ponies
And crisp apple strudels

526
00:47:58,753 --> 00:48:01,820
Doorbells and sleigh bells
And schnitzel with noodles

527
00:48:02,051 --> 00:48:04,868
Wild geese that fly
With the moon on their wings

528
00:48:05,093 --> 00:48:08,772
These are a few of my favorite things

529
00:48:09,994 --> 00:48:12,611
Girls in white dresses
With blue satin sashes

530
00:48:12,873 --> 00:48:15,943
Snowflakes that stay
On my nose and eyelashes

531
00:48:16,203 --> 00:48:19,138
Silver white winters
That melt into springs

532
00:48:19,405 --> 00:48:22,635
These are a few of my favorite things

533
00:48:22,832 --> 00:48:24,459
When the dog bites

534
00:48:24,688 --> 00:48:26,282
When the bee stings

535
00:48:26,514 --> 00:48:28,686
When I'm feeling sad

536
00:48:28,915 --> 00:48:32,147
I simply remember my favorite things

537
00:48:32,404 --> 00:48:38,966
And then I don't feel so bad

538
00:48:39,674 --> 00:48:41,267
- Does it work?
- Of course.

539
00:48:41,562 --> 00:48:43,418
- What do you like?
- Pussy willow!

540
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:46,231
- Christmas!
- Bunny rabbits!

541
00:48:46,461 --> 00:48:48,054
Snakes!

542
00:48:48,318 --> 00:48:50,360
- Chocolate icing!
- No school!

543
00:48:50,655 --> 00:48:51,735
Pillow fights!

544
00:48:52,002 --> 00:48:53,911
- Telegrams!
- Birthday presents!

545
00:48:54,304 --> 00:48:56,576
- Any presents!
- Ladybugs!

546
00:48:58,022 --> 00:48:59,296
A good sneeze!

547
00:48:59,587 --> 00:49:01,248
Gesundheit!

548
00:49:01,542 --> 00:49:02,722
See what fun it is?

549
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:05,768
Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens

550
00:49:06,024 --> 00:49:08,775
Bright copper kettles
And warm woolen mittens

551
00:49:09,034 --> 00:49:11,906
Brown paper packages
Tied up with strings

552
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:14,859
These are a few of my favorite things

553
00:49:18,158 --> 00:49:20,879
Cream-colored ponies
And crisp apple strudels

554
00:49:21,106 --> 00:49:23,857
Doorbells and sleigh bells
And schnitzel with noodles

555
00:49:24,082 --> 00:49:26,899
Wild geese that fly
With the moon on their wings

556
00:49:27,158 --> 00:49:30,509
These are a few of my favorite things

557
00:49:31,449 --> 00:49:32,877
Together.

558
00:49:33,147 --> 00:49:35,797
Girls in white dresses
With blue satin sashes

559
00:49:36,026 --> 00:49:38,810
Snowflakes that stay
On my nose and eyelashes

560
00:49:39,035 --> 00:49:41,907
Silver white winters
That melt into springs

561
00:49:42,173 --> 00:49:45,307
These are a few of my favorite things

562
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,640
When the dog bi...

563
00:49:47,842 --> 00:49:49,730
Dog bites.

564
00:49:56,102 --> 00:49:57,282
Hello.

565
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,476
Fraulein, did I not tell you that
bedtime is to be strictly observed?

566
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:04,357
The children were upset
by the storm, so l...

567
00:50:05,708 --> 00:50:06,657
You did, sir.

568
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:10,888
Do you, or do you not, have difficulty
remembering such simple instructions?

569
00:50:12,143 --> 00:50:13,705
Only during thunderstorms.

570
00:50:16,115 --> 00:50:17,543
Liesl?

571
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:19,885
I don't recall seeing you
after dinner.

572
00:50:20,471 --> 00:50:22,129
Really? As a matter of fact...

573
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:23,569
Yes?

574
00:50:24,342 --> 00:50:25,456
Well, I was...

575
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,696
What she would like to say...

576
00:50:27,897 --> 00:50:30,681
...is that she and I have
been getting acquainted tonight.

577
00:50:30,876 --> 00:50:35,547
It's too late to go into that. You
heard your father. Go back to bed.

578
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,343
Fraulein...

579
00:50:41,633 --> 00:50:45,499
...you have managed to remember
I'm leaving in the morning?

580
00:50:46,563 --> 00:50:50,909
Is it also possible you remember the
first rule in this house is discipline?

581
00:50:52,519 --> 00:50:54,910
Then I trust that before I return...

582
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,093
...you'll have acquired some?

583
00:50:58,411 --> 00:50:59,720
Captain?

584
00:51:00,651 --> 00:51:04,396
Could I talk to you about clothes
for the children for when they play?

585
00:51:04,654 --> 00:51:07,242
- Lf I could have some material.
- You are many things.

586
00:51:07,505 --> 00:51:09,578
Not the least of which is repetitious.

587
00:51:09,776 --> 00:51:11,852
- But they're children!
- Yes.

588
00:51:12,084 --> 00:51:13,776
And I'm their father.

589
00:51:14,326 --> 00:51:15,505
Good night.

590
00:51:38,789 --> 00:51:44,387
Girls in white dresses
With blue satin sashes

591
00:51:55,435 --> 00:51:58,820
When the dog bites
When the bee stings

592
00:51:59,054 --> 00:52:01,445
When I'm feeling sad

593
00:52:01,682 --> 00:52:04,845
I simply remember my favorite things

594
00:52:05,043 --> 00:52:07,084
And then I don't feel...

595
00:52:07,316 --> 00:52:13,964
...so bad

596
00:52:36,997 --> 00:52:39,585
Children, over here. See!

597
00:52:43,082 --> 00:52:44,390
Come on.

598
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:05,268
Fraulein Maria?

599
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:07,354
Can we do this every day?

600
00:54:07,643 --> 00:54:10,712
- Don't you think you'd get tired of it?
- I suppose so.

601
00:54:11,037 --> 00:54:12,248
Every other day?

602
00:54:12,446 --> 00:54:16,888
I haven't had so much fun since we put
glue on Fraulein Josephine's toothbrush.

603
00:54:17,088 --> 00:54:20,832
I can't understand how children
as nice as you can play such tricks.

604
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,848
- It's easy.
- But why do it?

605
00:54:23,043 --> 00:54:25,379
How else can we get
Father's attention?

606
00:54:26,118 --> 00:54:27,646
Oh, I see.

607
00:54:28,935 --> 00:54:31,042
We'll have to think about that one.

608
00:54:33,129 --> 00:54:34,692
All right, over here.

609
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:36,266
What are we going to do?

610
00:54:36,493 --> 00:54:38,380
Think of a song for the baroness.

611
00:54:38,606 --> 00:54:40,493
Father doesn't like us to sing.

612
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:44,167
Perhaps we can change his mind.
Now, what songs do you know?

613
00:54:44,432 --> 00:54:46,506
We don't know any songs.

614
00:54:46,739 --> 00:54:49,293
- Not any?
- We don't even know how to sing.

615
00:54:50,899 --> 00:54:52,974
Let's not lose time. You must learn.

616
00:54:53,238 --> 00:54:54,897
But how?

617
00:54:59,034 --> 00:55:02,833
Let's start at the very beginning

618
00:55:03,036 --> 00:55:06,268
A very good place to start

619
00:55:06,463 --> 00:55:08,317
When you read you begin with

620
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,722
A, B, C

621
00:55:09,919 --> 00:55:14,077
When you sing, you begin with
Do-Re-Mi

622
00:55:14,306 --> 00:55:15,868
Do-re-mi

623
00:55:16,131 --> 00:55:17,409
Do-re-mi

624
00:55:17,637 --> 00:55:21,316
The first three notes
Just happen to be

625
00:55:21,575 --> 00:55:23,267
Do-re-mi

626
00:55:23,496 --> 00:55:24,706
Do-re-mi

627
00:55:24,937 --> 00:55:28,714
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti

628
00:55:29,356 --> 00:55:31,691
Let's see if I can make it easier.

629
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:38,472
"Doe," a deer
A female deer

630
00:55:38,706 --> 00:55:42,123
"Ray," a drop of golden sun

631
00:55:42,385 --> 00:55:46,001
"Me," a name I call myself

632
00:55:46,262 --> 00:55:49,809
"Far," a long long way to run

633
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:53,686
"Sew," a needle pulling thread

634
00:55:53,978 --> 00:55:57,658
"La," a note to follow sew

635
00:55:57,917 --> 00:56:00,732
"Tea," a drink with jam and bread

636
00:56:01,181 --> 00:56:05,112
That will bring us back to doe

637
00:56:05,601 --> 00:56:09,017
- Doe
- A deer, a female deer

638
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:12,350
- Ray
- A drop of golden sun

639
00:56:12,581 --> 00:56:15,747
- Me
- A name I call myself

640
00:56:16,008 --> 00:56:18,975
- Far
- A long long way to run

641
00:56:19,466 --> 00:56:22,784
Sew, a needle pulling thread

642
00:56:22,988 --> 00:56:26,184
- La
- A note to follow sew

643
00:56:26,605 --> 00:56:29,357
- Tea
- A drink with jam and bread

644
00:56:29,615 --> 00:56:31,785
That will bring us back to

645
00:56:32,017 --> 00:56:35,314
- Doe
- A deer, a female deer

646
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:38,506
Ray, a drop of golden sun

647
00:56:38,965 --> 00:56:42,032
Me, a name I call myself

648
00:56:42,294 --> 00:56:45,230
Far, a long long way to run

649
00:56:45,496 --> 00:56:48,596
Sew, a needle pulling thread

650
00:56:48,889 --> 00:56:52,121
La, a note to follow sew

651
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:54,902
Tea, a drink with jam and bread

652
00:56:55,102 --> 00:56:58,999
That will bring us back to doe

653
00:56:59,393 --> 00:57:02,361
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do, so-do

654
00:57:02,788 --> 00:57:07,164
Do-re-mi-fa-so and so on are only
the tools we use to build a song.

655
00:57:07,428 --> 00:57:10,531
Once you have them in your head
you can sing different tunes...

656
00:57:10,792 --> 00:57:12,834
...by mixing them up. Like this:

657
00:57:14,026 --> 00:57:19,299
So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re

658
00:57:19,499 --> 00:57:20,548
Can you do that?

659
00:57:20,749 --> 00:57:26,023
So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re

660
00:57:26,223 --> 00:57:31,661
So-do-la-ti-do-re-do

661
00:57:31,956 --> 00:57:37,045
So-do-la-ti-do-re-do

662
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,932
Now, put it all together.

663
00:57:39,128 --> 00:57:45,492
So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re

664
00:57:45,725 --> 00:57:51,444
So-do-la-ti-do-re-do

665
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,489
- Good.
- But it doesn't mean anything.

666
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:57,571
So we put in words.
One word for every note.

667
00:57:57,827 --> 00:57:59,037
Like this:

668
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:05,567
When you know the notes to sing

669
00:58:05,831 --> 00:58:11,201
You can sing most anything

670
00:58:11,466 --> 00:58:12,395
Together!

671
00:58:12,586 --> 00:58:19,017
When you know the notes to sing

672
00:58:19,216 --> 00:58:25,613
You can sing most anything

673
00:58:26,004 --> 00:58:29,235
- Doe
- A deer, a female deer

674
00:58:29,495 --> 00:58:32,562
- Ray
- A drop of golden sun

675
00:58:32,826 --> 00:58:35,923
- Me
- A name I call myself

676
00:58:36,121 --> 00:58:39,058
- Far
- A long long way to run

677
00:58:39,292 --> 00:58:42,522
- Sew
- A needle pulling thread

678
00:58:42,812 --> 00:58:45,947
- La
- A note to follow sew

679
00:58:46,144 --> 00:58:49,016
- Tea
- A drink with jam and bread

680
00:58:49,218 --> 00:58:52,928
That will bring us back to doe

681
00:59:09,808 --> 00:59:15,823
When you know the notes to sing

682
00:59:16,368 --> 00:59:22,604
You can sing most anything

683
00:59:23,157 --> 00:59:26,193
Doe
A deer, a female deer

684
00:59:26,454 --> 00:59:29,839
Ray
A drop of golden sun

685
00:59:30,041 --> 00:59:33,360
Me
A name I call myself

686
00:59:33,596 --> 00:59:36,630
Far
A long long way to run

687
00:59:36,893 --> 00:59:39,929
Sew
A needle pulling thread

688
00:59:40,127 --> 00:59:43,197
La
A note to follow sew

689
00:59:43,778 --> 00:59:46,299
Tea
A drink with jam and bread

690
00:59:46,532 --> 00:59:50,331
That will bring us back to

691
00:59:50,534 --> 00:59:57,095
So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re

692
00:59:57,353 --> 01:00:01,666
So-do-la-fa-ti

693
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:03,461
La-so

694
01:00:06,864 --> 01:00:12,432
Ti-do

695
01:00:12,628 --> 01:00:14,059
So-do

696
01:00:26,972 --> 01:00:29,940
The mountains are magnificent,
really magnificent.

697
01:00:30,173 --> 01:00:32,727
- I had them put up just for you.
- Oh?

698
01:00:32,992 --> 01:00:35,065
Even if it's to a height
of 10,000 feet...

699
01:00:35,328 --> 01:00:38,713
...Georg always believes in
"rising to the occasion."

700
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:41,151
Improve the jokes
or I'll disinvite you.

701
01:00:41,732 --> 01:00:44,189
You didn't invite me.
I invited myself.

702
01:00:44,453 --> 01:00:46,876
- Naturally.
- You needed a chaperone...

703
01:00:47,142 --> 01:00:49,763
...and I needed a place
where the cuisine is superb...

704
01:00:50,025 --> 01:00:52,513
...the wine cellar unexcelled...

705
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:55,300
...and the price perfect.

706
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:57,418
Max, you are outrageous.

707
01:00:57,643 --> 01:01:01,478
Not at all.
I'm a very charming sponge.

708
01:01:04,017 --> 01:01:05,099
Listen.

709
01:01:07,348 --> 01:01:09,487
That's the Klopmann Monastery Choir.

710
01:01:12,374 --> 01:01:13,936
They're good.

711
01:01:14,934 --> 01:01:16,495
Very good.

712
01:01:17,272 --> 01:01:19,826
I must explore this area
in the next few days.

713
01:01:20,027 --> 01:01:23,345
Somewhere, a hungry singing group
is waiting for Max Detweiler...

714
01:01:23,582 --> 01:01:27,707
...to pluck it out and make it famous
at the Salzburg Folk Festival.

715
01:01:27,903 --> 01:01:31,070
- They get fame, you get money.
- It's unfair, I admit it.

716
01:01:31,332 --> 01:01:35,521
But someday that'll be changed.
I shall get the fame too.

717
01:01:42,279 --> 01:01:44,354
Good heavens, what's this?

718
01:01:45,737 --> 01:01:47,975
It's nothing.
Just some local urchins.

719
01:02:02,579 --> 01:02:06,324
This really is exciting for me, Georg.
Being here with you.

720
01:02:07,126 --> 01:02:09,582
Trees, lakes,
you've seen them before.

721
01:02:09,847 --> 01:02:12,338
That is not what I mean,
and you know it.

722
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:16,369
- You mean me? I'm exciting?
- Is that so impossible?

723
01:02:16,635 --> 01:02:19,541
No, just highly improbable.

724
01:02:19,775 --> 01:02:23,772
- There you go, running yourself down.
- Well, I'm a dangerous driver.

725
01:02:27,394 --> 01:02:30,942
You're much less of a riddle
when I see you here, Georg.

726
01:02:31,139 --> 01:02:33,859
- In my natural habitat?
- Yes, exactly.

727
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:36,192
Are you saying that I'm more
at home...

728
01:02:36,423 --> 01:02:40,256
...among the birds and the flowers
and the wind that moves...

729
01:02:40,522 --> 01:02:42,598
...through the trees
like a restless sea?

730
01:02:42,828 --> 01:02:44,356
How poetic.

731
01:02:44,557 --> 01:02:46,347
Yes, it was rather, wasn't it?

732
01:02:47,439 --> 01:02:52,362
More at home here than in Vienna
in all your glittering salons...

733
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:56,753
...gossiping gaily with bores I
detest, soaking myself in champagne...

734
01:02:57,044 --> 01:03:00,592
...stumbling about to waltzes
by Strausses I can't even remember?

735
01:03:00,887 --> 01:03:02,928
- Is that what you're saying?
- Yes.

736
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:05,365
Now whatever gave you that idea?

737
01:03:08,604 --> 01:03:12,347
Oh, I do like it here, Georg.
It's so lovely and peaceful.

738
01:03:12,671 --> 01:03:14,527
How can you leave it so often?

739
01:03:14,782 --> 01:03:17,500
Oh, pretending to be madly active,
I suppose.

740
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:20,861
Activity suggests a life
filled with purpose.

741
01:03:21,571 --> 01:03:23,744
Could it be running away
from memories?

742
01:03:26,822 --> 01:03:30,599
Or perhaps just searching
for a reason to stay.

743
01:03:31,239 --> 01:03:34,590
I hope that's why you've been
coming to Vienna so often.

744
01:03:35,243 --> 01:03:39,403
- Were there other distractions?
- I'd hardly call you a distraction.

745
01:03:39,629 --> 01:03:42,184
Well, what would you call me, Georg?

746
01:03:44,367 --> 01:03:45,580
Lovely...

747
01:03:46,546 --> 01:03:49,067
...charming, witty, graceful,
the perfect hostess...

748
01:03:49,267 --> 01:03:51,986
...and, you're going to hate me
for this...

749
01:03:52,405 --> 01:03:54,380
...in a way, my savior.

750
01:03:54,646 --> 01:03:56,403
Oh, how unromantic.

751
01:03:56,599 --> 01:03:58,836
I'd be an ungrateful wretch
if I didn't say...

752
01:03:59,097 --> 01:04:02,195
...that you brought some meaning back
into my life.

753
01:04:03,964 --> 01:04:06,616
I am amusing, I suppose.

754
01:04:06,845 --> 01:04:11,420
I have the finest couturier in Vienna
and a glittering circle of friends.

755
01:04:11,616 --> 01:04:14,617
- I do give some rather gay parties.
- Oh, yes.

756
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:16,607
But take all that away...

757
01:04:16,803 --> 01:04:21,060
...and you have just wealthy,
unattached little me...

758
01:04:21,702 --> 01:04:24,006
...searching, just like you.

759
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:30,533
More strudel, Herr Detweiler?

760
01:04:30,794 --> 01:04:32,258
- How many have I had?
- Two.

761
01:04:32,492 --> 01:04:34,350
Make it an uneven three.

762
01:04:37,518 --> 01:04:40,423
Still eating, Max?
Must be unhappy.

763
01:04:40,625 --> 01:04:44,424
That mixed quartet I've been trying
to steal away from Sol Hurok...

764
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:47,215
- What happened?
...Sascha Petrie stole them first.

765
01:04:47,445 --> 01:04:48,656
I hate thieves.

766
01:04:48,918 --> 01:04:52,085
Max, you really must try
and learn to love yourself.

767
01:04:52,313 --> 01:04:54,550
I had to call Paris, Rome
and Stockholm.

768
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:58,227
- On Georg's telephone, of course.
- How else could I afford it?

769
01:04:58,685 --> 01:05:03,608
I like rich people, the way they live
and how I live when I'm with them.

770
01:05:03,935 --> 01:05:05,846
I wonder where the children are.

771
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,631
They must have heard
I was coming and hid.

772
01:05:08,899 --> 01:05:11,290
I was hoping they'd be here
to welcome you.

773
01:05:11,524 --> 01:05:15,835
Max, do step out of character for
a moment and try and be charming.

774
01:05:24,523 --> 01:05:25,866
Well?

775
01:05:26,733 --> 01:05:27,878
Well what?

776
01:05:28,109 --> 01:05:30,892
Have you made up his mind?
Do I hear wedding bells?

777
01:05:31,151 --> 01:05:33,063
- Pealing madly.
- Marvelous.

778
01:05:33,296 --> 01:05:35,948
- Not necessarily for me.
- What kind of talk's that?

779
01:05:36,146 --> 01:05:37,642
None-of-your-business talk.

780
01:05:37,938 --> 01:05:40,275
I'm terribly fond of him,
so don't toy with us.

781
01:05:40,534 --> 01:05:43,983
But I'm a child. I like toys.
So tell me everything.

782
01:05:44,279 --> 01:05:49,139
Come on. Tell me every teensy-weensy,
intimate, disgusting detail.

783
01:05:50,556 --> 01:05:54,517
Well, let's just say I have a feeling
I may be here on approval.

784
01:05:54,749 --> 01:05:57,653
- I approve of that. How can you miss?
- Far too easily.

785
01:05:57,919 --> 01:06:01,020
If I know you, darling,
and I do, you will find a way.

786
01:06:01,282 --> 01:06:03,673
- He's no ordinary man.
- No, he's rich.

787
01:06:03,906 --> 01:06:06,079
His wife's death gave him
a great heartache.

788
01:06:06,276 --> 01:06:09,279
And your husband's death
gave you a great fortune.

789
01:06:09,478 --> 01:06:11,367
Oh, Max, you really are a beast.

790
01:06:11,558 --> 01:06:15,423
You and Georg are like family.
That's why I want to see you married.

791
01:06:15,659 --> 01:06:19,074
We must keep all that lovely money
in the family.

792
01:06:34,709 --> 01:06:37,523
- What are you doing there?
- Oh, Captain von Trapp.

793
01:06:37,782 --> 01:06:39,727
I was just looking for...

794
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:43,286
I didn't see, I mean,
I didn't know you were...

795
01:06:43,865 --> 01:06:45,493
Heil Hitler!

796
01:06:46,173 --> 01:06:47,601
Who are you?

797
01:06:47,867 --> 01:06:50,009
I have a telegram for Herr Detweiler.

798
01:06:50,269 --> 01:06:52,890
- I am Herr Detweiler.
- Yes, sir.

799
01:06:57,763 --> 01:07:00,250
You've delivered your telegram.
Now get out.

800
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:10,023
- Georg, he's just a boy.
- Yes, and I'm just an Austrian.

801
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:12,901
Things will happen.
Make sure they don't happen to you.

802
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:15,750
Max! Don't you ever say that again.

803
01:07:16,013 --> 01:07:18,118
I have no political convictions.

804
01:07:18,351 --> 01:07:21,167
- Can I help it if other people do?
- You can help it.

805
01:07:22,258 --> 01:07:24,330
You must help it.

806
01:07:34,201 --> 01:07:35,728
Hello?

807
01:07:38,266 --> 01:07:40,918
You're far away. Where are you?

808
01:07:41,212 --> 01:07:44,924
In a world that's disappearing,
I'm afraid.

809
01:07:45,726 --> 01:07:49,177
Is there any way I could bring you
back to the world I'm in?

810
01:08:14,064 --> 01:08:16,454
- Father! Father!
- There's your father!

811
01:08:17,233 --> 01:08:19,756
Oh, captain, you're home!

812
01:08:27,798 --> 01:08:30,353
Come out of that water at once!

813
01:08:39,103 --> 01:08:41,209
Oh, you must be Baroness Schraeder.

814
01:08:46,307 --> 01:08:49,178
I'm soaked to the skin!

815
01:09:00,651 --> 01:09:01,994
Straight line!

816
01:09:16,084 --> 01:09:18,386
This is Baroness Schraeder.

817
01:09:20,886 --> 01:09:22,577
And these...

818
01:09:22,807 --> 01:09:24,335
...are my children.

819
01:09:25,401 --> 01:09:26,832
How do you do?

820
01:09:27,866 --> 01:09:32,409
Go inside, dry off, clean up, change
your clothes and report back here!

821
01:09:37,217 --> 01:09:39,225
Fraulein, you will stay here, please!

822
01:09:40,898 --> 01:09:44,316
I think I'd better go see
what Max is up to.

823
01:09:54,123 --> 01:09:55,815
Now, fraulein...

824
01:09:57,645 --> 01:09:59,621
...I want a truthful answer.

825
01:10:00,014 --> 01:10:01,422
Yes, captain.

826
01:10:01,712 --> 01:10:05,608
Is it possible,
or could I have just imagined it?

827
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:11,371
Have my children, by any chance,
been climbing trees today?

828
01:10:11,829 --> 01:10:12,943
Yes, captain.

829
01:10:13,974 --> 01:10:15,250
I see.

830
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:20,112
And where, may I ask,
did they get these...

831
01:10:20,377 --> 01:10:22,354
- Play clothes.
- Is that what they are?

832
01:10:22,556 --> 01:10:25,820
I made them from the drapes
that used to hang in my bedroom.

833
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:28,631
- Drapes?
- They have plenty of wear left.

834
01:10:28,831 --> 01:10:30,686
We've been everywhere in them.

835
01:10:30,913 --> 01:10:35,191
Are you telling me that my children
have been roaming about Salzburg...

836
01:10:35,395 --> 01:10:38,625
...dressed up in nothing
but some old drapes?

837
01:10:38,852 --> 01:10:40,447
And having a marvelous time!

838
01:10:40,647 --> 01:10:43,747
- They have uniforms.
- Forgive me, straitjackets.

839
01:10:43,977 --> 01:10:46,629
They can't be children
if they worry about clothes...

840
01:10:46,889 --> 01:10:47,971
They don't complain.

841
01:10:48,203 --> 01:10:50,790
They don't dare.
They love you too much and fear...

842
01:10:51,021 --> 01:10:52,517
Don't discuss my children.

843
01:10:52,718 --> 01:10:54,574
You've got to hear, you're
never home...

844
01:10:54,766 --> 01:10:56,227
I don't want to hear more!

845
01:10:56,464 --> 01:10:58,854
I know you don't, but you've got to!

846
01:10:59,602 --> 01:11:01,674
- Liesl's not a child.
- Not one word...

847
01:11:01,939 --> 01:11:04,690
Soon she'll be a woman
and you won't even know her.

848
01:11:04,948 --> 01:11:07,885
Friedrich wants to be a man
but you're not here to show...

849
01:11:08,151 --> 01:11:09,427
Don't you dare tell me...

850
01:11:09,655 --> 01:11:12,788
Brigitta could tell you about him.
She notices everything.

851
01:11:13,017 --> 01:11:16,018
Kurt acts tough to hide the pain
when you ignore him...

852
01:11:16,219 --> 01:11:17,682
...the way you do all of them.

853
01:11:17,949 --> 01:11:20,252
Louisa, I don't know about yet.

854
01:11:20,509 --> 01:11:23,578
The little ones just want love.
Please, love them all.

855
01:11:23,839 --> 01:11:25,302
I don't care to hear more.

856
01:11:25,538 --> 01:11:29,467
- I am not finished yet, captain!
- Oh, yes, you are, captain!

857
01:11:30,948 --> 01:11:32,062
Fraulein.

858
01:11:33,316 --> 01:11:37,281
Now, you will pack
your things this minute...

859
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:39,871
...and return to the abbey.

860
01:11:42,410 --> 01:11:43,687
What's that?

861
01:11:45,356 --> 01:11:46,339
It's singing.

862
01:11:46,958 --> 01:11:49,641
Yes, I realize it's singing.
But who is singing?

863
01:11:50,576 --> 01:11:52,070
The children.

864
01:11:54,833 --> 01:11:56,110
The children?

865
01:11:56,658 --> 01:11:59,279
I taught them something to sing
for the baroness.

866
01:12:04,696 --> 01:12:10,482
My heart wants to sing
Every song it hears

867
01:12:10,749 --> 01:12:13,204
Every song that it hears

868
01:12:13,469 --> 01:12:18,687
My heart wants to beat like the wings
Of the birds that rise

869
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:21,945
From the lake to the trees

870
01:12:22,177 --> 01:12:23,553
To the trees

871
01:12:23,780 --> 01:12:28,517
My heart wants to sigh
Like a chime that flies

872
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:33,153
From a church on a breeze

873
01:12:33,415 --> 01:12:37,161
To laugh like a brook
When it trips and falls

874
01:12:37,419 --> 01:12:40,235
Over stones on its way

875
01:12:40,526 --> 01:12:41,836
On its way

876
01:12:42,062 --> 01:12:46,318
To sing through the night

877
01:12:46,512 --> 01:12:51,949
Like a lark who is learning to pray

878
01:12:52,211 --> 01:12:56,523
I go to the hills

879
01:12:56,726 --> 01:13:02,709
When my heart is lonely

880
01:13:02,972 --> 01:13:06,520
I know I will hear

881
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:12,317
What I've heard before

882
01:13:13,118 --> 01:13:17,181
My heart will be blessed

883
01:13:17,410 --> 01:13:24,092
With the sound of music

884
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:29,925
And I'll sing...

885
01:13:30,154 --> 01:13:37,925
...once more

886
01:14:09,859 --> 01:14:11,551
Edelweiss!

887
01:14:15,365 --> 01:14:18,401
You never told me how enchanting
your children are.

888
01:14:26,667 --> 01:14:28,163
Don't go away.

889
01:14:33,072 --> 01:14:34,414
Fraulein.

890
01:14:37,618 --> 01:14:38,763
I...

891
01:14:40,181 --> 01:14:42,865
...behaved badly. I apologize.

892
01:14:44,535 --> 01:14:47,985
I'm far too outspoken.
It's one of my worst faults.

893
01:14:48,376 --> 01:14:49,785
You were right.

894
01:14:52,156 --> 01:14:53,977
I don't know my children.

895
01:14:55,227 --> 01:14:59,192
There's still time, captain.
They want so much to be close to you.

896
01:14:59,518 --> 01:15:03,232
And you brought music back
into the house.

897
01:15:04,514 --> 01:15:05,890
I'd forgotten.

898
01:15:08,517 --> 01:15:09,793
Fraulein.

899
01:15:12,199 --> 01:15:13,410
I want you to stay.

900
01:15:17,257 --> 01:15:19,876
I ask you to stay.

901
01:15:21,644 --> 01:15:24,995
- Lf I could be of any help.
- You have already.

902
01:15:25,583 --> 01:15:26,598
More than you know.

903
01:15:45,530 --> 01:15:46,807
Marta.

904
01:15:47,515 --> 01:15:48,694
Curtain!

905
01:15:51,263 --> 01:15:54,459
High on a hill was a lonely goatherd

906
01:15:55,904 --> 01:15:59,039
Loud was the voice
Of the lonely goatherd

907
01:16:00,483 --> 01:16:03,617
Folks in a town
That was quite remote heard

908
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:08,227
Lusty and clear
From the goatherd's throat heard

909
01:16:19,277 --> 01:16:22,030
Marta. Marta!

910
01:16:24,338 --> 01:16:26,249
Gretl, the prince!

911
01:16:27,924 --> 01:16:31,242
A prince on the bridge
Of a castle moat heard

912
01:16:32,664 --> 01:16:34,901
Men on a road
With a load to tote heard

913
01:16:37,304 --> 01:16:40,438
Men in the midst
Of a table d'hote heard

914
01:16:41,723 --> 01:16:44,857
Men drinking beer
With the foam afloat heard

915
01:16:55,492 --> 01:16:58,493
One little girl
In a pale pink coat heard

916
01:17:00,071 --> 01:17:03,269
She yodeled back
To the lonely goatherd

917
01:17:04,392 --> 01:17:07,657
Soon her mama
With a gleaming gloat heard

918
01:17:09,098 --> 01:17:12,265
What a duet for a girl and goatherd

919
01:17:56,968 --> 01:18:00,102
One little girl
In a pale pink coat heard

920
01:18:01,578 --> 01:18:04,711
She yodeled back
To the lonely goatherd

921
01:18:05,998 --> 01:18:09,294
Soon her mama
With a gleaming gloat heard

922
01:18:10,705 --> 01:18:13,708
What a duet for a girl and goatherd

923
01:18:15,347 --> 01:18:16,910
Happy are they

924
01:18:19,765 --> 01:18:22,897
Soon the duet will become a trio

925
01:18:46,405 --> 01:18:47,932
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

926
01:18:48,134 --> 01:18:49,564
Very good!

927
01:18:51,304 --> 01:18:53,129
Wonderful!

928
01:18:53,706 --> 01:18:56,741
- Can we keep the puppets, Uncle Max?
- Yes, can we?

929
01:18:56,939 --> 01:18:58,883
Of course you may, my darlings.

930
01:18:59,086 --> 01:19:03,146
Why else did I tell Professor Kohner
to send the bill to your father?

931
01:19:06,738 --> 01:19:08,331
Well done, fraulein.

932
01:19:10,739 --> 01:19:12,628
I really am very much impressed.

933
01:19:12,821 --> 01:19:14,730
They're your children, captain.

934
01:19:21,658 --> 01:19:23,863
My dear, is there anything
you can't do?

935
01:19:24,123 --> 01:19:26,361
Well, I'm not sure
I'll make a good nun.

936
01:19:26,588 --> 01:19:29,559
If you have any problems,
I'd be happy to help you.

937
01:19:32,545 --> 01:19:33,920
Attention, everyone!

938
01:19:34,114 --> 01:19:37,432
I have an announcement to make.
Surprise! Surprise!

939
01:19:37,668 --> 01:19:39,872
Today, after a long
and desperate search...

940
01:19:40,134 --> 01:19:44,926
...I have found a most exciting
entry for the Salzburg Folk Festival.

941
01:19:45,127 --> 01:19:46,885
Congratulations, Max.

942
01:19:47,114 --> 01:19:49,962
And who will you
be exploiting this time?

943
01:19:51,692 --> 01:19:54,761
- The Saint Ignatius Choir?
- Guess again.

944
01:19:55,439 --> 01:19:59,215
Well, let me see now.
The Klopmann Choir?

945
01:19:59,441 --> 01:20:01,744
- No, no, no, no.
- No, no?

946
01:20:01,936 --> 01:20:03,083
Tell us.

947
01:20:03,283 --> 01:20:06,601
A singing group all in one family.
You'll never guess, Georg.

948
01:20:06,869 --> 01:20:09,652
What a charming idea!

949
01:20:09,847 --> 01:20:11,571
Whose family?

950
01:20:12,409 --> 01:20:13,969
Yours.

951
01:20:14,169 --> 01:20:16,407
They'll be the talk of the festival.

952
01:20:19,133 --> 01:20:22,002
- Well, now, what's so funny?
- You are, Max.

953
01:20:22,270 --> 01:20:25,273
You're expensive, but very funny.

954
01:20:25,985 --> 01:20:28,222
- They'll be a sensation!
- No, Max.

955
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:30,587
It's a wonderful idea.
Fresh, original.

956
01:20:30,787 --> 01:20:35,394
Max! My children
do not sing in public.

957
01:20:36,038 --> 01:20:37,926
You can't blame me for trying.

958
01:20:38,119 --> 01:20:40,991
Children, who shall we hear
from next?

959
01:20:43,691 --> 01:20:44,804
Who?

960
01:20:50,735 --> 01:20:51,881
Yes.

961
01:20:54,642 --> 01:20:56,497
The vote is unanimous.

962
01:20:57,297 --> 01:20:58,794
You, captain.

963
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:00,206
Me?

964
01:21:01,013 --> 01:21:03,219
- I don't understand.
- Please.

965
01:21:09,179 --> 01:21:11,220
No, no, no, no.

966
01:21:11,483 --> 01:21:13,459
I'm told that you were quite good.

967
01:21:13,661 --> 01:21:16,828
- That was a very, very long time ago.
- I remember, Father.

968
01:21:17,055 --> 01:21:19,806
- Play us something we know.
- Oh, please, Father.

969
01:21:22,625 --> 01:21:23,641
Well...

970
01:21:33,481 --> 01:21:35,554
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What?

971
01:21:35,818 --> 01:21:38,021
To bring along my harmonica.

972
01:21:40,269 --> 01:21:42,309
Edelweiss

973
01:21:43,823 --> 01:21:46,027
Edelweiss

974
01:21:47,088 --> 01:21:53,039
Every morning you greet me

975
01:21:53,268 --> 01:21:56,203
Small and white

976
01:21:57,013 --> 01:22:00,245
Clean and bright

977
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:03,158
You look happy...

978
01:22:03,354 --> 01:22:07,034
...to meet me

979
01:22:07,292 --> 01:22:09,498
Blossom of snow

980
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:13,720
May you bloom and grow

981
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:20,000
Bloom and grow forever

982
01:22:20,932 --> 01:22:24,480
Edelweiss

983
01:22:24,709 --> 01:22:27,200
Edelweiss

984
01:22:27,848 --> 01:22:34,824
Bless my homeland forever

985
01:22:39,022 --> 01:22:42,090
- Edelweiss
- Edelweiss

986
01:22:42,384 --> 01:22:45,737
- Edelweiss
- Edelweiss

987
01:22:45,938 --> 01:22:52,085
Every morning you greet me

988
01:22:52,310 --> 01:22:55,695
- Small and white
- Small and white

989
01:22:55,961 --> 01:22:59,280
- Clean and bright
- Clean and bright

990
01:22:59,485 --> 01:23:01,874
You look happy...

991
01:23:02,108 --> 01:23:05,590
...to meet me

992
01:23:06,046 --> 01:23:08,088
Blossom of snow

993
01:23:08,288 --> 01:23:12,284
May you bloom and grow

994
01:23:12,514 --> 01:23:19,295
Bloom and grow forever

995
01:23:19,526 --> 01:23:23,010
Edelweiss

996
01:23:23,243 --> 01:23:25,796
Edelweiss

997
01:23:26,379 --> 01:23:35,876
Bless my homeland forever

998
01:23:44,789 --> 01:23:48,306
Anytime you say the word, Georg,
you can be part of my new act:

999
01:23:48,504 --> 01:23:50,895
The von Trapp Family Singers.

1000
01:23:51,964 --> 01:23:54,353
I have a wonderful idea, Georg.

1001
01:23:54,587 --> 01:23:56,957
Let's really fill this house
with music.

1002
01:23:57,179 --> 01:24:00,030
You must give a grand
and glorious party for me.

1003
01:24:00,287 --> 01:24:02,874
- A party?
- Yes, Father, please!

1004
01:24:03,073 --> 01:24:05,343
It's high time
I met all your friends...

1005
01:24:05,633 --> 01:24:08,025
...and they met me.
Don't you agree?

1006
01:24:08,292 --> 01:24:10,434
- I see what you mean.
- Oh, please!

1007
01:24:10,694 --> 01:24:13,729
Children, it's bedtime.
Come now, say good night.

1008
01:24:14,631 --> 01:24:15,877
Good night, Father.

1009
01:24:16,074 --> 01:24:18,790
- Good night.
- Good night, Baroness Schraeder.

1010
01:24:19,018 --> 01:24:20,512
Good night, Father.

1011
01:24:23,372 --> 01:24:25,129
Good night, Uncle Max.

1012
01:24:26,959 --> 01:24:29,992
It'll be my first party, Father!

1013
01:25:01,220 --> 01:25:03,741
- Captain.
- Herr Zeller. Baroness Schraeder.

1014
01:25:03,942 --> 01:25:06,942
- Good evening, Herr Zeller.
- Baroness.

1015
01:25:08,201 --> 01:25:10,568
How do you do? Good evening.

1016
01:25:30,357 --> 01:25:33,654
Did you notice the obvious
display of the Austrian flag?

1017
01:25:40,442 --> 01:25:42,167
The women look so beautiful.

1018
01:25:42,428 --> 01:25:43,704
I think they look ugly.

1019
01:25:43,965 --> 01:25:45,721
You're just scared of them.

1020
01:25:45,950 --> 01:25:48,089
Silly, only grown-up men fear women.

1021
01:25:48,671 --> 01:25:52,088
- I think the men look beautiful.
- How would you know?

1022
01:26:07,197 --> 01:26:09,139
Liesl, who are you dancing with?

1023
01:26:09,341 --> 01:26:10,903
Nobody.

1024
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:13,504
Oh, yes, you are.

1025
01:26:15,875 --> 01:26:17,306
May I have this dance?

1026
01:26:17,508 --> 01:26:19,900
I'd be delighted, young man.

1027
01:26:26,412 --> 01:26:28,968
Why didn't you tell me
you could dance?

1028
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:33,937
We feared you'd make us all dance.
The von Trapp Family Dancers.

1029
01:26:38,168 --> 01:26:39,794
What are they playing?

1030
01:26:40,025 --> 01:26:42,548
It's the Laendler.
An Austrian folk dance.

1031
01:26:42,748 --> 01:26:45,783
- Show me.
- I haven't danced since I was little.

1032
01:26:45,981 --> 01:26:47,869
You remember. Please?

1033
01:26:48,127 --> 01:26:49,984
- Well...
- Please.

1034
01:26:50,210 --> 01:26:52,348
All right. Come on over here.

1035
01:26:52,836 --> 01:26:55,553
Now you bow and I curtsy.

1036
01:26:56,454 --> 01:26:59,273
- Like this?
- Fine. Now we go for a little walk.

1037
01:26:59,499 --> 01:27:02,051
One, two, three. One, two, three.

1038
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:06,763
One, two, three, step together.
Now, step hop, step hop.

1039
01:27:06,993 --> 01:27:09,547
Now turn under. Not quite.

1040
01:27:09,746 --> 01:27:13,548
This way. Hop step, hop.
And under.

1041
01:27:14,199 --> 01:27:15,825
Kurt, we'll have to practice.

1042
01:27:16,055 --> 01:27:17,485
Do allow me, will you?

1043
01:28:42,238 --> 01:28:44,029
I don't remember anymore.

1044
01:28:46,116 --> 01:28:48,222
- Your face is all red.
- Is it?

1045
01:28:49,510 --> 01:28:51,520
I don't suppose I'm used to dancing.

1046
01:28:54,123 --> 01:28:56,033
Why, that was beautifully done.

1047
01:28:56,301 --> 01:28:58,124
What a lovely couple you make.

1048
01:28:58,317 --> 01:29:00,359
It's time the children
said good night.

1049
01:29:00,624 --> 01:29:01,901
We'll be in the hall.

1050
01:29:02,128 --> 01:29:04,881
- We have something special prepared.
- Right!

1051
01:29:05,171 --> 01:29:06,286
Yes, come on!

1052
01:29:12,860 --> 01:29:15,098
All that needless worrying, Georg.

1053
01:29:15,357 --> 01:29:18,261
You thought you wouldn't find
a friend at the party.

1054
01:29:21,057 --> 01:29:24,508
- A bit chilly out tonight, isn't it?
- Oh, I don't know.

1055
01:29:24,706 --> 01:29:26,652
It seemed rather warm to me.

1056
01:29:30,666 --> 01:29:31,845
Ladies and gentlemen.

1057
01:29:32,555 --> 01:29:36,488
The children of Captain von Trapp
wish to say good night to you.

1058
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:53,787
There's a sad sort of clanging
From the clock in the hall

1059
01:29:53,982 --> 01:29:57,562
And the bells in the steeple too

1060
01:29:57,824 --> 01:30:01,689
And up in the nursery
An absurd little bird

1061
01:30:01,891 --> 01:30:04,227
Is popping up to say "coo-coo"

1062
01:30:04,454 --> 01:30:06,048
Coo-coo

1063
01:30:06,313 --> 01:30:07,493
Coo-coo

1064
01:30:07,722 --> 01:30:09,796
Regretfully they tell us

1065
01:30:09,995 --> 01:30:11,305
But firmly they compel us

1066
01:30:11,565 --> 01:30:14,502
To say goodbye

1067
01:30:14,703 --> 01:30:19,791
To you

1068
01:30:22,871 --> 01:30:26,614
So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, good night

1069
01:30:26,808 --> 01:30:30,522
I hate to go
And leave this pretty sight

1070
01:30:37,508 --> 01:30:40,706
So long, farewell,
Auf Wiedersehen, adieu

1071
01:30:41,350 --> 01:30:44,736
Adieu, adieu
To you and you and you

1072
01:30:51,792 --> 01:30:55,437
So long, farewell
Au revoir, auf Wiedersehen

1073
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:59,478
I'd like to stay
And taste my first champagne

1074
01:30:59,703 --> 01:31:02,036
- Yes?
- No.

1075
01:31:06,203 --> 01:31:09,718
So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye

1076
01:31:10,045 --> 01:31:13,846
I leave and heave a sigh
And say goodbye

1077
01:31:14,049 --> 01:31:17,880
Goodbye

1078
01:31:20,809 --> 01:31:23,778
I'm glad to go

1079
01:31:24,010 --> 01:31:26,762
I cannot tell a lie

1080
01:31:27,084 --> 01:31:29,957
I flit, I float

1081
01:31:30,224 --> 01:31:33,542
I fleetly flee, I fly

1082
01:31:43,195 --> 01:31:48,699
The sun has gone to bed

1083
01:31:48,928 --> 01:31:52,510
And so must I

1084
01:31:52,706 --> 01:31:55,010
So long

1085
01:31:55,237 --> 01:31:57,694
Farewell

1086
01:31:57,894 --> 01:32:03,081
Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye

1087
01:32:03,341 --> 01:32:08,463
Goodbye

1088
01:32:09,137 --> 01:32:14,478
Goodbye

1089
01:32:14,710 --> 01:32:21,305
Goodbye

1090
01:32:21,499 --> 01:32:29,656
Goodbye

1091
01:32:34,470 --> 01:32:37,124
Extraordinary!
What they'd do at the festival.

1092
01:32:37,353 --> 01:32:39,745
Young lady,
I must have a word with you.

1093
01:32:40,715 --> 01:32:44,548
Georg, you won't let this girl
get away. She must join the party.

1094
01:32:44,815 --> 01:32:47,118
- No, really l...
- Stop. Stop it now.

1095
01:32:47,378 --> 01:32:50,195
- Georg, please.
- You can if you want to, fraulein.

1096
01:32:50,421 --> 01:32:52,811
I insist.
You will be my dinner partner.

1097
01:32:53,015 --> 01:32:54,839
This is business.
Franz...

1098
01:32:55,096 --> 01:32:58,132
...set another place next to mine
for Fraulein Maria.

1099
01:33:00,222 --> 01:33:02,842
- Whatever you say.
- It appears to be all arranged.

1100
01:33:03,614 --> 01:33:05,406
- It does.
- I'm not suitably dressed.

1101
01:33:06,434 --> 01:33:07,864
You can change. We'll wait.

1102
01:33:11,334 --> 01:33:14,151
Captain, you must be very proud
of your youngsters.

1103
01:33:14,344 --> 01:33:15,175
I am, thank you.

1104
01:33:15,434 --> 01:33:19,813
Is there a more beautiful expression
of what is good in our country...

1105
01:33:20,045 --> 01:33:23,345
...than the innocent voices
of our children?

1106
01:33:23,729 --> 01:33:25,039
Oh, come now, baron.

1107
01:33:25,265 --> 01:33:28,881
Would you have us believe that Austria
holds a monopoly on virtue?

1108
01:33:29,751 --> 01:33:33,713
Herr Zeller, some of us prefer
Austrian voices raised in song...

1109
01:33:33,913 --> 01:33:36,215
...to ugly German threats.

1110
01:33:37,244 --> 01:33:40,726
The ostrich buries his head
in the sand...

1111
01:33:40,926 --> 01:33:43,743
...and sometimes in the flag.

1112
01:33:44,257 --> 01:33:48,285
Perhaps those who would warn you that
the Anschluss is coming, and it is...

1113
01:33:48,548 --> 01:33:52,099
...would get further with you by setting
their words to music.

1114
01:33:52,298 --> 01:33:56,775
If the Nazis take over Austria, you
will be the entire trumpet section.

1115
01:33:57,070 --> 01:33:58,051
You flatter me.

1116
01:33:59,054 --> 01:34:02,799
Oh, how clumsy of me.
I meant to accuse you.

1117
01:34:10,231 --> 01:34:12,623
It's very kind of you
to offer to help me, baroness.

1118
01:34:12,890 --> 01:34:14,386
I'm delighted, Maria.

1119
01:34:14,844 --> 01:34:18,393
I really don't think I have anything
that would be appropriate.

1120
01:34:18,846 --> 01:34:22,811
Now where is that lovely little thing
you were wearing the other evening?

1121
01:34:23,043 --> 01:34:26,209
When the captain couldn't keep
his eyes off you.

1122
01:34:29,448 --> 01:34:31,206
Couldn't keep his eyes off me?

1123
01:34:32,491 --> 01:34:34,218
Come, my dear, we are women.

1124
01:34:34,445 --> 01:34:37,709
Let's not pretend we don't know
when a man notices us.

1125
01:34:37,937 --> 01:34:41,232
- Here we are.
- The captain notices everybody.

1126
01:34:41,781 --> 01:34:44,115
There's no need to feel
so defensive, Maria.

1127
01:34:44,342 --> 01:34:46,711
You are quite attractive, you know.

1128
01:34:46,937 --> 01:34:50,417
The captain would hardly be a man
if he didn't notice you.

1129
01:34:51,962 --> 01:34:54,234
Baroness, I hope you're joking.

1130
01:34:54,685 --> 01:34:55,896
Not at all.

1131
01:34:56,126 --> 01:34:57,655
I've never done a thing to...

1132
01:34:57,918 --> 01:34:59,414
You don't have to, my dear.

1133
01:35:00,033 --> 01:35:04,673
Nothing's more irresistible to a man
than a woman who's in love with him.

1134
01:35:05,896 --> 01:35:08,234
- In love with him?
- Of course.

1135
01:35:09,131 --> 01:35:12,397
What makes it so nice is
he thinks he's in love with you.

1136
01:35:15,024 --> 01:35:16,552
But that's not true.

1137
01:35:16,945 --> 01:35:20,296
Surely you've noticed the way
he looks into your eyes.

1138
01:35:20,562 --> 01:35:25,269
And you know, you blushed in his arms
when you were dancing just now.

1139
01:35:26,456 --> 01:35:28,083
Don't take it to heart.

1140
01:35:28,348 --> 01:35:30,554
He'll get over it soon enough,
I think.

1141
01:35:30,813 --> 01:35:32,702
Men do, you know.

1142
01:35:33,662 --> 01:35:34,711
Then I should go.

1143
01:35:36,001 --> 01:35:37,376
I mustn't stay here.

1144
01:35:47,436 --> 01:35:50,732
- Is there something I can do to help?
- No, nothing.

1145
01:35:52,431 --> 01:35:53,611
Yes.

1146
01:35:54,578 --> 01:35:56,521
Don't say a word to the captain.

1147
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:01,520
No, I wouldn't dream of it.

1148
01:36:08,027 --> 01:36:09,523
Goodbye, Maria.

1149
01:36:10,301 --> 01:36:12,987
I'm sure you'll make a very fine nun.

1150
01:36:41,817 --> 01:36:43,729
Champagne, darling.

1151
01:36:44,122 --> 01:36:47,954
I feel like celebrating. Cheers.

1152
01:36:53,219 --> 01:36:56,004
- You know something.
- Perhaps.

1153
01:36:56,229 --> 01:37:00,578
If you're so clever, tell me how to
get fraulein to influence Georg.

1154
01:37:00,809 --> 01:37:03,334
I want those children in the festival.

1155
01:37:03,788 --> 01:37:05,993
Elsa, this is important to Austria.

1156
01:37:06,190 --> 01:37:07,819
Wouldn't do you any harm either.

1157
01:37:08,018 --> 01:37:09,546
I thought of that.

1158
01:37:09,778 --> 01:37:12,145
Well, if it's a matter of influence...

1159
01:37:12,337 --> 01:37:15,123
...maybe the one you have
to be talking to is me.

1160
01:40:31,830 --> 01:40:33,969
- Two.
- Three.

1161
01:40:34,231 --> 01:40:35,662
- Four.
- Five.

1162
01:40:36,859 --> 01:40:38,802
- Six.
- Seven.

1163
01:40:39,068 --> 01:40:40,629
Eight.

1164
01:40:40,862 --> 01:40:42,618
- Four.
- Two.

1165
01:40:43,679 --> 01:40:45,437
- Seven.
- Five.

1166
01:40:45,666 --> 01:40:47,773
- Two.
- Six.

1167
01:40:52,232 --> 01:40:54,176
Isn't this fun?

1168
01:40:55,531 --> 01:40:57,769
- Four.
- I'm number five.

1169
01:40:58,028 --> 01:41:00,103
- Oh, yes.
- Eight.

1170
01:41:00,399 --> 01:41:02,672
- Two.
- Four.

1171
01:41:03,058 --> 01:41:04,236
Six.

1172
01:41:06,611 --> 01:41:07,789
Two.

1173
01:41:08,884 --> 01:41:11,736
Baroness Schraeder, do you mind
if we stop now? We're tired.

1174
01:41:11,959 --> 01:41:13,849
Whatever you want, dear.

1175
01:41:14,105 --> 01:41:16,017
We'll do it again tomorrow.

1176
01:41:25,798 --> 01:41:27,870
The country's so restful, isn't it?

1177
01:41:28,872 --> 01:41:30,432
Have some lemonade.

1178
01:41:31,625 --> 01:41:33,001
There must be an easier way.

1179
01:41:34,346 --> 01:41:37,480
I get a fiendish delight thinking
of you as the mother of seven.

1180
01:41:38,381 --> 01:41:40,141
How do you plan to do it?

1181
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:42,345
Darling, haven't you ever heard...

1182
01:41:42,610 --> 01:41:45,581
...of a delightful little thing
called boarding school?

1183
01:41:46,679 --> 01:41:48,851
Baroness Machiavelli.

1184
01:41:50,137 --> 01:41:52,048
Uncle Max, where's Father?

1185
01:41:52,314 --> 01:41:54,040
I think he's in the house.

1186
01:41:54,237 --> 01:41:56,693
What's the matter
with all you gloomy pussies?

1187
01:41:56,926 --> 01:41:59,612
- Nothing.
- I know. Let's have a rehearsal.

1188
01:41:59,807 --> 01:42:00,670
What for?

1189
01:42:00,864 --> 01:42:03,258
Let's make believe we're on-stage
at the festival.

1190
01:42:03,463 --> 01:42:07,173
- I don't feel like singing.
- Not without Fraulein Maria.

1191
01:42:07,432 --> 01:42:09,736
Liesl, get the guitar.
Come on, Marta.

1192
01:42:09,931 --> 01:42:12,779
Everybody into the group.
Get in your places.

1193
01:42:13,036 --> 01:42:15,689
Now be cheerful, right?
Give us the key, Liesl.

1194
01:42:17,521 --> 01:42:20,076
Now, impress me.

1195
01:42:23,924 --> 01:42:25,203
Gretl, why don't you sing?

1196
01:42:25,462 --> 01:42:27,830
I can't. I've got a sore finger.

1197
01:42:28,824 --> 01:42:31,761
But you sang so beautifully
the night of the party.

1198
01:42:31,964 --> 01:42:34,202
Come on, all of you.
Try something you know.

1199
01:42:34,430 --> 01:42:35,859
Enjoy it. Be cheerful.

1200
01:42:36,127 --> 01:42:37,689
All right, Liesl.

1201
01:42:39,555 --> 01:42:44,742
The hills are alive

1202
01:42:44,968 --> 01:42:52,328
With the sound of music

1203
01:42:53,485 --> 01:42:58,346
With songs they have sung

1204
01:42:58,579 --> 01:43:06,104
For a thousand years

1205
01:43:06,778 --> 01:43:11,964
The hills fill my heart

1206
01:43:12,189 --> 01:43:19,583
With the sound of music

1207
01:43:19,909 --> 01:43:22,432
They wanted to sing for me,
bless their hearts.

1208
01:43:22,728 --> 01:43:24,550
That's lovely, lovely.
Don't stop.

1209
01:43:28,395 --> 01:43:32,142
- Something long and cool, Georg?
- No, thank you, darling.

1210
01:43:32,530 --> 01:43:34,866
- Father?
- Yes, Brigitta?

1211
01:43:35,282 --> 01:43:37,454
Is it true Fraulein Maria
isn't coming back?

1212
01:43:37,747 --> 01:43:40,719
Yes, I suppose it's true.
What have we got here?

1213
01:43:41,014 --> 01:43:45,523
- Pink lemonade.
- Laced with lemonade.

1214
01:43:46,234 --> 01:43:47,698
I don't believe it, Father.

1215
01:43:49,022 --> 01:43:50,964
- What?
- About Fraulein Maria.

1216
01:43:51,359 --> 01:43:52,537
Oh, Fraulein Maria!

1217
01:43:52,833 --> 01:43:56,154
Didn't I tell you what her note said?
I'm sure I did.

1218
01:43:56,869 --> 01:43:59,260
She said she missed her life
at the abbey.

1219
01:43:59,527 --> 01:44:01,600
She had to leave us.

1220
01:44:01,833 --> 01:44:03,362
And that's all there is to it.

1221
01:44:05,003 --> 01:44:07,590
I think I'm brave enough to try
some of that.

1222
01:44:07,789 --> 01:44:10,411
- She didn't even say goodbye.
- She did in her note.

1223
01:44:10,672 --> 01:44:12,397
That isn't the same thing.

1224
01:44:12,689 --> 01:44:14,251
Not too sweet, not too sour.

1225
01:44:14,964 --> 01:44:16,875
Just too pink.

1226
01:44:18,264 --> 01:44:21,232
Father, who is our new governess
going to be?

1227
01:44:27,615 --> 01:44:28,662
Well...

1228
01:44:30,911 --> 01:44:35,937
...you're not going to have
a governess anymore.

1229
01:44:36,262 --> 01:44:38,819
- We're not?
- No.

1230
01:44:40,939 --> 01:44:42,980
You're going to have a new mother.

1231
01:44:44,045 --> 01:44:45,989
A new mother?

1232
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:49,803
We talked about it last night.
It's all settled.

1233
01:44:50,003 --> 01:44:52,589
And we're all going to be very happy.

1234
01:45:24,271 --> 01:45:26,641
Well, all right, all right.
Run off and play.

1235
01:45:57,325 --> 01:45:58,252
Yes, my children?

1236
01:45:58,445 --> 01:46:00,749
- My name is Liesl.
- Yes, Liesl?

1237
01:46:01,231 --> 01:46:05,010
We, my brothers and sisters,
want to see Fraulein Maria.

1238
01:46:06,129 --> 01:46:08,042
Fraulein Maria?

1239
01:46:08,787 --> 01:46:10,676
Oh, Maria.

1240
01:46:12,505 --> 01:46:14,261
Come in, please.

1241
01:46:17,979 --> 01:46:19,475
Wait here.

1242
01:46:29,991 --> 01:46:33,026
I'm Sister Margaretta. I understand
you inquired about Maria.

1243
01:46:33,289 --> 01:46:35,680
We have to see her.
Will you tell her we're here?

1244
01:46:35,916 --> 01:46:38,406
- I'm afraid I can't do that.
- But you've got to!

1245
01:46:38,701 --> 01:46:40,679
- She's our governess.
- We want her back.

1246
01:46:40,881 --> 01:46:42,705
She didn't even say goodbye.

1247
01:46:42,930 --> 01:46:44,621
All we want to do is talk to her.

1248
01:46:45,364 --> 01:46:48,150
I'm very sorry,
but Maria is in seclusion.

1249
01:46:48,374 --> 01:46:51,344
- She hasn't been seeing anyone.
- She'll see us.

1250
01:46:51,579 --> 01:46:53,968
I want to show her my finger.

1251
01:46:54,173 --> 01:46:55,995
Some other time, dear.

1252
01:46:56,254 --> 01:46:57,499
I'll tell her you were here.

1253
01:46:57,759 --> 01:47:00,696
- It was sweet of you to call.
- We have to speak to her!

1254
01:47:01,312 --> 01:47:04,317
Run along, children.
Run along home.

1255
01:47:04,519 --> 01:47:06,079
I'm sure she'd like to see us.

1256
01:47:06,343 --> 01:47:08,515
Sister Margaretta, please.

1257
01:47:08,744 --> 01:47:12,328
- Goodbye, children.
- Sister Margaretta, may we, please?

1258
01:47:14,990 --> 01:47:16,649
What was that about, Sister?

1259
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:18,989
The von Trapp children,
Reverend Mother.

1260
01:47:19,219 --> 01:47:21,553
They want to see Maria.

1261
01:47:21,810 --> 01:47:24,015
Has she spoken yet?
Has she told you anything?

1262
01:47:24,275 --> 01:47:28,108
She doesn't say a word,
Reverend Mother, except in prayer.

1263
01:47:28,375 --> 01:47:29,326
Poor child.

1264
01:47:29,530 --> 01:47:32,380
It's strange.
She seems happy to be back here...

1265
01:47:32,605 --> 01:47:35,771
...and yet she's unhappy too.

1266
01:47:36,992 --> 01:47:39,930
Perhaps I have been wrong
in leaving her alone so long.

1267
01:47:40,196 --> 01:47:42,783
Bring her to me,
even if she's not yet ready.

1268
01:47:42,984 --> 01:47:44,577
Yes, Reverend Mother.

1269
01:47:49,868 --> 01:47:53,219
Sister Augusta, take our new postulant
to the robing room.

1270
01:47:54,190 --> 01:47:56,363
God bless you, my daughter.

1271
01:48:02,325 --> 01:48:03,986
Yes, bring her in.

1272
01:48:12,639 --> 01:48:14,811
You've been unhappy. I'm sorry.

1273
01:48:16,769 --> 01:48:17,916
Reverend Mother.

1274
01:48:18,243 --> 01:48:20,767
Why did they send you back to us?

1275
01:48:21,574 --> 01:48:23,464
They didn't send me back.
I left.

1276
01:48:25,867 --> 01:48:27,363
Sit down, Maria.

1277
01:48:27,853 --> 01:48:29,577
Tell me what happened.

1278
01:48:34,578 --> 01:48:35,857
I was frightened.

1279
01:48:36,115 --> 01:48:40,396
- Frightened? Were they unkind to you.
- Oh, no!

1280
01:48:40,629 --> 01:48:44,178
No, I was confused. I felt...

1281
01:48:45,593 --> 01:48:47,602
I've never felt that way before.

1282
01:48:47,836 --> 01:48:51,451
I couldn't stay. I knew that here
I'd be away from it. I'd be safe.

1283
01:48:51,679 --> 01:48:56,190
Maria, our abbey is not to be used
as an escape.

1284
01:48:56,453 --> 01:48:58,594
What is it you can't face?

1285
01:49:00,486 --> 01:49:01,862
I can't face him again.

1286
01:49:02,664 --> 01:49:04,127
Him?

1287
01:49:05,644 --> 01:49:07,620
Thank you, Sister Margaretta.

1288
01:49:16,852 --> 01:49:18,415
Captain von Trapp?

1289
01:49:23,645 --> 01:49:26,231
- Are you in love with him?
- I don't know!

1290
01:49:26,463 --> 01:49:27,871
I don't know. L...

1291
01:49:28,381 --> 01:49:32,062
The baroness said I was.
She said that he was in love with me.

1292
01:49:32,321 --> 01:49:34,879
But I didn't want to believe it.

1293
01:49:35,910 --> 01:49:38,114
There were times we looked
at each other.

1294
01:49:38,312 --> 01:49:39,807
I could hardly breathe.

1295
01:49:40,169 --> 01:49:42,758
- Did you let him see your feelings?
- I don't know.

1296
01:49:43,341 --> 01:49:45,896
That's what's torturing me.
I was on God's errand.

1297
01:49:46,096 --> 01:49:50,890
To have asked for his love would have
been wrong. I just couldn't stay.

1298
01:49:52,979 --> 01:49:55,664
I'm ready at this moment
to take my vows.

1299
01:49:56,502 --> 01:49:59,439
- Please help me.
- Maria.

1300
01:50:00,954 --> 01:50:05,465
The love of a man and a woman is holy.
You have a great capacity to love.

1301
01:50:05,695 --> 01:50:08,511
You must find out how God
wants you to spend your love.

1302
01:50:08,802 --> 01:50:12,484
But I pledged my life to God.
I pledged my life to his service.

1303
01:50:12,678 --> 01:50:16,871
My daughter, if you love this man,
it doesn't mean you love God less.

1304
01:50:18,475 --> 01:50:20,264
No.

1305
01:50:20,491 --> 01:50:22,282
You must find out.

1306
01:50:23,950 --> 01:50:26,341
You must go back.

1307
01:50:26,608 --> 01:50:28,498
You can't ask me to do that.

1308
01:50:28,690 --> 01:50:31,081
- Please let me stay. I beg...
- Maria.

1309
01:50:31,284 --> 01:50:35,086
These walls were not built
to shut out problems.

1310
01:50:35,289 --> 01:50:36,815
You have to face them.

1311
01:50:37,371 --> 01:50:40,505
You have to live the life
you were born to live.

1312
01:50:46,145 --> 01:50:50,275
Climb every mountain

1313
01:50:50,500 --> 01:50:54,117
Search high and low

1314
01:50:54,343 --> 01:50:58,922
Follow every byway

1315
01:50:59,148 --> 01:51:03,243
Every path you know

1316
01:51:03,665 --> 01:51:07,943
Climb every mountain

1317
01:51:08,210 --> 01:51:12,371
Ford every stream

1318
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:16,793
Follow every rainbow

1319
01:51:17,051 --> 01:51:21,212
Till you find your dream

1320
01:51:21,407 --> 01:51:24,377
A dream that will need

1321
01:51:24,610 --> 01:51:29,252
All the love you can give

1322
01:51:29,992 --> 01:51:33,256
Every day of your life

1323
01:51:33,515 --> 01:51:39,662
For as long as you live

1324
01:51:39,950 --> 01:51:44,080
Climb every mountain

1325
01:51:44,307 --> 01:51:48,467
Ford every stream

1326
01:51:48,727 --> 01:51:53,106
Follow every rainbow

1327
01:51:53,306 --> 01:52:01,375
Till you find your dream

1328
01:52:02,435 --> 01:52:05,788
A dream that will need

1329
01:52:06,087 --> 01:52:11,394
All the love you can give

1330
01:52:11,659 --> 01:52:15,011
Every day of your life

1331
01:52:15,246 --> 01:52:21,417
For as long as you live

1332
01:52:21,653 --> 01:52:25,908
Climb every mountain

1333
01:52:26,135 --> 01:52:29,912
Ford every stream

1334
01:52:30,552 --> 01:52:34,999
Follow every rainbow

1335
01:52:35,389 --> 01:52:39,321
Till you find...

1336
01:52:39,554 --> 01:52:49,154
...your dream

1337
01:52:51,597 --> 01:52:55,014
Now, it's not like my children
to be secretive.

1338
01:52:55,248 --> 01:52:57,257
We're not being secretive, Father.

1339
01:52:58,867 --> 01:53:02,066
And it's not like my children
to be late for dinner.

1340
01:53:02,325 --> 01:53:05,626
- We lost track of the time.
- I see.

1341
01:53:06,394 --> 01:53:09,658
Who's going to be the first one
to tell me the truth? Friedrich.

1342
01:53:09,918 --> 01:53:11,893
Brigitta. Liesl.

1343
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:15,354
Where do you think we were, Father?

1344
01:53:21,671 --> 01:53:25,471
If you don't believe us, you must have
some idea of where you think we were.

1345
01:53:28,909 --> 01:53:30,634
- Marta.
- Yes, Father.

1346
01:53:30,831 --> 01:53:32,043
You tell me.

1347
01:53:33,328 --> 01:53:36,813
Friedrich told you, Father.
We were berry picking.

1348
01:53:37,621 --> 01:53:42,096
- I forgot! You were berry picking.
- Yes, we love berry picking.

1349
01:53:42,326 --> 01:53:43,377
All afternoon?

1350
01:53:43,608 --> 01:53:45,267
- We picked thousands.
- Thousands?

1351
01:53:45,466 --> 01:53:48,250
- They were all over the place.
- What kind of berries?

1352
01:53:48,507 --> 01:53:51,643
- Blueberries, sir.
- Blueberries.

1353
01:53:53,505 --> 01:53:56,739
It's too early for blueberries.

1354
01:53:58,181 --> 01:54:00,190
- They were strawberries.
- Strawberries?

1355
01:54:00,872 --> 01:54:03,458
It's been so cold lately,
they turned blue.

1356
01:54:09,071 --> 01:54:11,145
Very well. Show me the berries.

1357
01:54:12,370 --> 01:54:13,516
- We...
- Well...

1358
01:54:13,747 --> 01:54:16,400
- Show me the berries you picked.
- We don't have them.

1359
01:54:16,628 --> 01:54:18,802
You don't have them?
What happened to them?

1360
01:54:19,031 --> 01:54:21,717
- We...
- We ate them.

1361
01:54:21,914 --> 01:54:24,404
- You ate them?
- Yes!

1362
01:54:24,603 --> 01:54:26,131
- They were so good.
- Delicious.

1363
01:54:26,366 --> 01:54:27,512
Very well.

1364
01:54:27,773 --> 01:54:32,699
Since you've obviously stuffed
yourselves on thousands of berries...

1365
01:54:32,929 --> 01:54:36,708
...you can't be hungry anymore,
so I'll have to tell Frau Schmidt...

1366
01:54:36,937 --> 01:54:39,684
...to skip your dinner.

1367
01:54:48,496 --> 01:54:51,184
It's your fault.
We should have told him the truth.

1368
01:54:51,445 --> 01:54:53,330
And made him boiling mad at us?

1369
01:54:53,525 --> 01:54:55,379
It's better than starving to death.

1370
01:54:55,606 --> 01:54:58,357
We didn't do anything wrong.
We just wanted to see her.

1371
01:54:59,610 --> 01:55:02,579
My stomach's making noises.

1372
01:55:03,002 --> 01:55:05,724
The least they could have done
was to let us say hello.

1373
01:55:06,815 --> 01:55:10,561
- I wonder what grass tastes like.
- I feel awful.

1374
01:55:10,980 --> 01:55:15,076
When Fraulein Maria wanted to feel
better she used to sing that song.

1375
01:55:15,655 --> 01:55:17,064
Let's try it.

1376
01:55:17,287 --> 01:55:19,845
Raindrops on roses

1377
01:55:20,138 --> 01:55:24,003
And whiskers on kittens

1378
01:55:24,814 --> 01:55:27,304
Bright copper kettles

1379
01:55:27,505 --> 01:55:30,444
And warm woolen mittens

1380
01:55:31,732 --> 01:55:37,455
Brown paper packages
Tied up with strings

1381
01:55:37,723 --> 01:55:43,477
These are a few of my favorite things

1382
01:55:43,710 --> 01:55:45,654
Why don't I feel better?

1383
01:55:46,784 --> 01:55:48,989
Girls in white dresses

1384
01:55:49,253 --> 01:55:52,221
With blue satin sashes

1385
01:55:52,489 --> 01:55:57,894
Snowflakes that stay
On my nose and eyelashes

1386
01:55:58,251 --> 01:56:01,287
- Silver white winters...
- Fraulein Maria's back!

1387
01:56:01,488 --> 01:56:02,731
...that melt into springs

1388
01:56:03,121 --> 01:56:06,254
These are a few of my favorite things

1389
01:56:06,484 --> 01:56:09,451
When the dog bites
When the bee stings

1390
01:56:09,652 --> 01:56:11,692
When I'm feeling sad

1391
01:56:12,183 --> 01:56:15,034
I simply remember my favorite things

1392
01:56:15,289 --> 01:56:17,462
And then I don't feel

1393
01:56:17,658 --> 01:56:24,157
So bad

1394
01:56:24,385 --> 01:56:27,293
- Children, I'm so glad to see you.
- We missed you.

1395
01:56:27,526 --> 01:56:28,474
I missed you.

1396
01:56:28,742 --> 01:56:30,785
- Kurt, how are you?
- Hungry.

1397
01:56:32,264 --> 01:56:34,788
- What happened to your finger?
- It got caught.

1398
01:56:35,050 --> 01:56:37,125
- Caught in what?
- Friedrich's teeth.

1399
01:56:38,318 --> 01:56:40,390
- Liesl, you all right?
- Just fair.

1400
01:56:40,592 --> 01:56:43,462
- Any telegrams been delivered lately?
- None at all.

1401
01:56:43,699 --> 01:56:46,996
But I'm learning to accept it.
I'll be glad when school begins.

1402
01:56:47,283 --> 01:56:51,795
Liesl, you can't use school to escape
your problems. You have to face them.

1403
01:56:52,027 --> 01:56:53,401
I have so much to tell you.

1404
01:56:53,658 --> 01:56:55,570
We have things to tell you too.

1405
01:56:55,901 --> 01:56:59,449
The most important thing is
that Father is going to be married.

1406
01:56:59,649 --> 01:57:00,663
Married?

1407
01:57:00,993 --> 01:57:02,936
Yes, to Baroness Schraeder.

1408
01:57:10,536 --> 01:57:12,031
Oh, I see.

1409
01:57:13,806 --> 01:57:17,037
Father, look!
Fraulein Maria's back!

1410
01:57:17,262 --> 01:57:19,240
Fraulein Maria's back from the abbey.

1411
01:57:21,364 --> 01:57:22,378
Good evening, captain.

1412
01:57:23,796 --> 01:57:25,039
Good evening.

1413
01:57:27,478 --> 01:57:29,235
Everyone inside for dinner.

1414
01:57:29,528 --> 01:57:31,024
Dinner!

1415
01:57:40,001 --> 01:57:44,546
You left without saying goodbye.
Even to the children.

1416
01:57:45,512 --> 01:57:46,975
It was wrong of me. Forgive me.

1417
01:57:48,937 --> 01:57:50,051
Why did you?

1418
01:57:50,252 --> 01:57:52,970
Please don't ask me.
The reason no longer exists.

1419
01:57:54,094 --> 01:57:57,063
Fraulein Maria, you've returned.

1420
01:57:58,259 --> 01:57:59,985
Isn't it wonderful, Georg?

1421
01:58:03,159 --> 01:58:05,299
I wish you every happiness,
baroness.

1422
01:58:05,529 --> 01:58:08,116
You too, captain.
The children say you're to marry.

1423
01:58:08,348 --> 01:58:09,427
Thank you, my dear.

1424
01:58:11,869 --> 01:58:15,286
You are back to stay?

1425
01:58:17,281 --> 01:58:20,482
Only until arrangements can be made
for another governess.

1426
01:59:13,939 --> 01:59:15,501
There you are.

1427
01:59:29,310 --> 01:59:31,679
I must speak to cook
about the schnitzel.

1428
01:59:31,936 --> 01:59:35,104
It is entirely too delicious
for my figure.

1429
01:59:35,524 --> 01:59:38,342
And it makes you much too quiet
at the dinner table.

1430
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:40,510
Or was it the wine?

1431
01:59:40,744 --> 01:59:42,502
Undoubtedly the wine.

1432
01:59:44,973 --> 01:59:47,146
You have no idea
the trouble I'm having...

1433
01:59:47,406 --> 01:59:50,027
...trying to decide on
a wedding present for you.

1434
01:59:50,321 --> 01:59:52,399
Oh, I know. I'm enough.

1435
01:59:52,661 --> 01:59:56,107
But I do want you to have
some little trifle for the occasion.

1436
01:59:56,342 --> 01:59:58,580
At first I thought
of a fountain pen...

1437
01:59:58,807 --> 02:00:00,981
...but you've already got one.

1438
02:00:01,242 --> 02:00:04,059
Then I thought perhaps a villa
in the south of France...

1439
02:00:04,285 --> 02:00:06,839
...but they are so difficult
to gift-wrap.

1440
02:00:07,103 --> 02:00:09,407
Oh, Georg, how do you
feel about yachts?

1441
02:00:09,696 --> 02:00:11,871
A long, sleek one
for the Mediterranean...

1442
02:00:12,100 --> 02:00:14,754
...or a tiny one
for your bathtub, huh?

1443
02:00:16,841 --> 02:00:18,783
- Elsa.
- Where to go on our honeymoon?

1444
02:00:19,018 --> 02:00:20,544
Now, that's a real problem.

1445
02:00:20,749 --> 02:00:23,979
A trip around the world
would be lovely. And then I said:

1446
02:00:24,270 --> 02:00:26,990
"Oh, Elsa, there must be
someplace better to go."

1447
02:00:27,248 --> 02:00:29,583
- But don't worry, darling, I'Il...
- Elsa.

1448
02:00:30,228 --> 02:00:31,439
Yes, Georg.

1449
02:00:32,405 --> 02:00:33,681
It's no use...

1450
02:00:34,838 --> 02:00:36,149
...you and I.

1451
02:00:37,658 --> 02:00:40,759
I'm being dishonest to both of us...

1452
02:00:42,046 --> 02:00:43,641
...and utterly unfair to you.

1453
02:00:48,706 --> 02:00:51,329
- When two people talk of marriage...
- No, don't.

1454
02:00:52,166 --> 02:00:54,176
Don't say another word, please.

1455
02:00:57,355 --> 02:01:02,181
You see, there are other things
I've been thinking of.

1456
02:01:03,056 --> 02:01:07,599
Fond as I am of you, I really don't
think you're the right man for me.

1457
02:01:10,035 --> 02:01:12,427
You're much too independent.

1458
02:01:12,727 --> 02:01:17,237
And I need someone
who needs me desperately...

1459
02:01:17,530 --> 02:01:20,403
...or at least needs
my money desperately.

1460
02:01:22,496 --> 02:01:27,201
I've enjoyed every moment we've had
together and I do thank you for that.

1461
02:01:29,862 --> 02:01:31,687
Now, if you'll forgive me...

1462
02:01:31,881 --> 02:01:33,855
...I'll go inside,
pack my little bags...

1463
02:01:34,090 --> 02:01:36,481
...and return to Vienna
where I belong.

1464
02:01:41,648 --> 02:01:43,405
And somewhere out there...

1465
02:01:43,699 --> 02:01:47,892
...is a young lady who, I think...

1466
02:01:48,151 --> 02:01:49,329
...will never be a nun.

1467
02:02:00,992 --> 02:02:03,230
Auf Wiedersehen, darling.

1468
02:02:27,926 --> 02:02:29,042
Hello.

1469
02:02:34,620 --> 02:02:38,073
I thought I just might find you here.

1470
02:02:42,083 --> 02:02:44,257
Was there something you wanted?

1471
02:02:44,679 --> 02:02:47,681
No, no, no. Sit down, please.

1472
02:02:48,586 --> 02:02:49,864
Please.

1473
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:56,076
May I?

1474
02:03:07,961 --> 02:03:12,506
You know, I was thinking
and I was wondering two things:

1475
02:03:13,630 --> 02:03:17,692
Why did you run away to the abbey?

1476
02:03:18,498 --> 02:03:22,976
And what was it
that made you come back?

1477
02:03:24,586 --> 02:03:28,865
Well, I had an obligation
to fulfill...

1478
02:03:29,068 --> 02:03:31,112
...and I came back to fulfill it.

1479
02:03:31,727 --> 02:03:33,101
Is that all?

1480
02:03:34,384 --> 02:03:36,458
And I missed the children.

1481
02:03:36,788 --> 02:03:37,900
Yes.

1482
02:03:39,126 --> 02:03:41,906
- Only the children?
- No. Yes.

1483
02:03:42,134 --> 02:03:45,814
- Isn't it right that I missed them?
- Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

1484
02:03:46,010 --> 02:03:48,532
I was only hoping that perhaps you...

1485
02:03:49,595 --> 02:03:51,288
Perhaps you might...

1486
02:03:52,958 --> 02:03:54,138
Yes?

1487
02:03:55,842 --> 02:04:00,931
Well, nothing was the same
when you were away...

1488
02:04:01,672 --> 02:04:04,773
...and it'll be all wrong again
after you leave...

1489
02:04:04,971 --> 02:04:09,447
...and I just thought perhaps
you might change your mind.

1490
02:04:13,361 --> 02:04:17,423
Well, I'm sure the baroness will be
able to make things fine for you.

1491
02:04:17,687 --> 02:04:18,963
Maria...

1492
02:04:20,983 --> 02:04:24,336
- There isn't going to be any baroness.
- There isn't?

1493
02:04:26,653 --> 02:04:27,963
No.

1494
02:04:28,255 --> 02:04:29,947
I don't understand.

1495
02:04:32,256 --> 02:04:36,187
Well, we've called off our engagement,
you see, and...

1496
02:04:36,453 --> 02:04:39,772
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yes. You are?

1497
02:04:40,905 --> 02:04:42,914
- You did?
- Yes.

1498
02:04:44,013 --> 02:04:48,358
Well, you can't marry someone
when you're...

1499
02:04:50,834 --> 02:04:52,810
...in love with someone else...

1500
02:04:56,054 --> 02:04:57,427
...can you?

1501
02:05:30,900 --> 02:05:33,107
The Reverend Mother always says:

1502
02:05:33,334 --> 02:05:36,631
"When the Lord closes a door,
somewhere He opens a window."

1503
02:05:44,254 --> 02:05:47,155
What else does
the Reverend Mother say?

1504
02:05:48,060 --> 02:05:50,362
That you have to look for your life.

1505
02:05:51,965 --> 02:05:54,419
Is that why you came back?

1506
02:05:58,302 --> 02:05:59,707
And have you found it...

1507
02:06:00,669 --> 02:06:01,782
...Maria?

1508
02:06:03,486 --> 02:06:05,394
I think I have.

1509
02:06:08,028 --> 02:06:09,371
I know I have.

1510
02:06:11,775 --> 02:06:13,369
I love you.

1511
02:06:17,179 --> 02:06:18,970
Oh, can this be happening to me?

1512
02:06:22,207 --> 02:06:27,386
Perhaps I had a wicked childhood

1513
02:06:28,828 --> 02:06:33,847
Perhaps I had a miserable youth

1514
02:06:35,645 --> 02:06:41,345
But somewhere
In my wicked, miserable past

1515
02:06:41,823 --> 02:06:47,383
There must have been a moment of truth

1516
02:06:48,284 --> 02:06:54,776
For here you are
Standing there loving me

1517
02:06:55,485 --> 02:07:01,239
Whether or not you should

1518
02:07:01,854 --> 02:07:08,377
So somewhere in my youth or childhood

1519
02:07:09,211 --> 02:07:16,533
I must have done something good

1520
02:07:17,725 --> 02:07:20,573
Nothing comes from nothing

1521
02:07:21,663 --> 02:07:25,369
Nothing ever could

1522
02:07:26,171 --> 02:07:34,683
So somewhere in my youth or childhood

1523
02:07:36,186 --> 02:07:45,299
I must have done something good

1524
02:07:46,140 --> 02:07:50,778
Do you know when I first
started loving you?

1525
02:07:51,165 --> 02:07:54,902
That night at dinner, when you sat
on that ridiculous pine cone.

1526
02:07:55,129 --> 02:07:56,373
What?

1527
02:07:57,658 --> 02:08:00,975
I knew the first time you blew
that silly whistle.

1528
02:08:01,853 --> 02:08:03,763
Oh, my love.

1529
02:08:07,386 --> 02:08:14,970
For here you are
Standing there loving me

1530
02:08:16,859 --> 02:08:22,458
Whether or not you should

1531
02:08:23,773 --> 02:08:30,514
So somewhere in my youth or childhood

1532
02:08:31,294 --> 02:08:38,678
I must have done something good

1533
02:08:39,802 --> 02:08:43,154
Nothing comes from nothing

1534
02:08:43,869 --> 02:08:46,768
Nothing ever could

1535
02:08:47,003 --> 02:08:52,569
So somewhere in my youth...

1536
02:08:52,829 --> 02:08:54,968
...or childhood

1537
02:08:57,946 --> 02:09:04,209
I must have done something

1538
02:09:06,169 --> 02:09:18,292
Something good

1539
02:09:24,731 --> 02:09:26,192
Maria.

1540
02:09:27,962 --> 02:09:32,371
Is there anyone I should go to,
to ask permission to marry you?

1541
02:09:36,122 --> 02:09:38,575
- Why don't we ask...
- The children?

1542
02:11:22,651 --> 02:11:26,511
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

1543
02:11:27,287 --> 02:11:30,833
How do you catch a cloud
And pin it down?

1544
02:11:31,772 --> 02:11:35,762
How do you find a word
That means Maria?

1545
02:11:36,183 --> 02:11:37,131
A flibbertigibbet

1546
02:11:37,367 --> 02:11:40,499
A will-o'-the-wisp
A clown

1547
02:11:40,696 --> 02:11:45,072
Many a thing you know
You'd like to tell her

1548
02:11:45,495 --> 02:11:49,357
Many a thing she ought to understand

1549
02:11:50,041 --> 02:11:54,165
But how do you make her stay
And listen to all you say?

1550
02:11:54,522 --> 02:11:58,294
How do you keep a wave upon the sand?

1551
02:11:58,617 --> 02:12:03,407
Oh, how do you solve
A problem like Maria?

1552
02:12:03,771 --> 02:12:10,128
How do you hold a moonbeam
In your hand?

1553
02:14:11,063 --> 02:14:12,561
Herr Detweiler!

1554
02:14:15,064 --> 02:14:17,614
- Heil Hitler.
- Oh, good afternoon, Herr Zeller.

1555
02:14:17,848 --> 02:14:21,009
Perhaps you've not heard.
I am now the Gauleiter.

1556
02:14:21,305 --> 02:14:22,768
Heil Hitler.

1557
02:14:23,639 --> 02:14:24,753
Heil Hitler.

1558
02:14:25,049 --> 02:14:27,216
I've come from
Captain von Trapp's house.

1559
02:14:27,636 --> 02:14:31,086
The only one in the area
not flying the Third Reich flag...

1560
02:14:31,319 --> 02:14:32,532
...since the Anschluss.

1561
02:14:32,730 --> 02:14:34,802
- But we have dealt with that.
- I don't...

1562
02:14:35,065 --> 02:14:37,874
The housekeeper told me
that I would find you here.

1563
02:14:38,132 --> 02:14:39,758
The only thing she'd tell me.

1564
02:14:40,244 --> 02:14:42,672
What kind of information
are you looking for?

1565
02:14:42,936 --> 02:14:44,726
When will the captain return?

1566
02:14:45,241 --> 02:14:49,013
Well, he's on his honeymoon trip.
He's not been in touch with us.

1567
02:14:49,236 --> 02:14:53,876
Am I to believe he hasn't communicated
with his children in over a month?

1568
02:14:54,137 --> 02:14:55,957
How many men do you know...

1569
02:14:56,211 --> 02:14:59,376
...who communicate with their children
while honeymooning?

1570
02:15:00,246 --> 02:15:03,795
Upon his return, he'll fill
his proper position in the new order.

1571
02:15:04,088 --> 02:15:06,355
Naturally.
And may I congratulate you...

1572
02:15:06,581 --> 02:15:11,053
...and your people in allowing the
festival to go on tonight as planned.

1573
02:15:11,575 --> 02:15:14,892
Why should it not go on?
Nothing in Austria has changed.

1574
02:15:15,126 --> 02:15:18,389
Singing and music will
show this to the world.

1575
02:15:18,584 --> 02:15:20,207
Austria is the same.

1576
02:15:21,045 --> 02:15:22,357
Heil Hitler.

1577
02:15:24,439 --> 02:15:25,965
Heil Hitler.

1578
02:15:27,572 --> 02:15:28,753
Come, let's go home.

1579
02:15:28,981 --> 02:15:32,332
- Why was he so cross?
- Everybody's cross these days.

1580
02:15:32,536 --> 02:15:35,766
Maybe the flag with the black spider
makes people nervous.

1581
02:15:35,961 --> 02:15:38,774
- Will Father be in trouble?
- He doesn't have to be.

1582
02:15:38,998 --> 02:15:41,616
The thing to do
is to get along with everybody.

1583
02:15:41,849 --> 02:15:43,952
Remember that tonight at the concert.

1584
02:15:44,182 --> 02:15:46,966
Are we really going to sing
before a lot of people?

1585
02:15:47,158 --> 02:15:49,164
Look. The von Trapp Family Singers:

1586
02:15:49,364 --> 02:15:53,775
Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Brigitta,
Kurt, Marta and Gretl.

1587
02:15:53,973 --> 02:15:58,162
- Why am I always last?
- Because you are the most important.

1588
02:15:58,839 --> 02:16:00,397
There we go.

1589
02:16:06,039 --> 02:16:09,352
Are you sure Father will approve
of our singing in public?

1590
02:16:09,556 --> 02:16:11,764
He'll be pleased and proud.

1591
02:16:12,216 --> 02:16:14,582
- Liesl, do you think so?
- Don't you trust me?

1592
02:16:14,776 --> 02:16:15,757
No.

1593
02:16:15,959 --> 02:16:17,963
You're a very intelligent girl.

1594
02:16:18,483 --> 02:16:20,557
Liesl. Liesl!

1595
02:16:21,460 --> 02:16:22,608
Rolfe!

1596
02:16:23,576 --> 02:16:25,516
I'm so glad to see you.
It's been su...

1597
02:16:25,720 --> 02:16:26,765
Good afternoon.

1598
02:16:27,158 --> 02:16:29,972
Give this to your father
as soon as he's home.

1599
02:16:30,613 --> 02:16:32,403
- He's on his honeymoon.
- I know.

1600
02:16:32,600 --> 02:16:35,796
- You do?
- We make it our business to know all.

1601
02:16:36,501 --> 02:16:38,958
- Who's "we"?
- See that he gets it.

1602
02:16:39,157 --> 02:16:41,392
- What is it?
- It's a telegram from Berlin.

1603
02:16:42,200 --> 02:16:44,587
Don't you want to deliver it yourself?

1604
02:16:45,048 --> 02:16:47,563
I'm occupied
with more important matters.

1605
02:16:47,763 --> 02:16:50,153
And your father had better be too.

1606
02:16:50,420 --> 02:16:51,851
But, Rolfe!

1607
02:17:14,006 --> 02:17:15,599
Father!

1608
02:17:15,863 --> 02:17:18,414
- We didn't expect you so soon.
- Hello, hello!

1609
02:17:18,642 --> 02:17:21,326
We didn't expect you home
until next week!

1610
02:17:21,524 --> 02:17:26,737
- Did you bring souvenirs from Paris?
- Hello! How are you?

1611
02:17:27,795 --> 02:17:29,041
Why didn't you call us?

1612
02:17:29,238 --> 02:17:31,091
We couldn't get through.

1613
02:17:31,379 --> 02:17:33,239
I had nothing to do with that.

1614
02:17:33,496 --> 02:17:35,437
We came back as fast as we could.

1615
02:17:35,734 --> 02:17:37,804
Well, well, well! We missed you!

1616
02:17:38,035 --> 02:17:40,372
- We missed you!
- We missed kissing you.

1617
02:17:40,562 --> 02:17:43,285
We missed all the noise
in the morning.

1618
02:17:43,543 --> 02:17:47,568
- Mostly, we missed hearing you sing.
- Oh, you came back just in time.

1619
02:17:47,763 --> 02:17:49,454
Look, Fraulein Maria...

1620
02:17:49,652 --> 02:17:51,212
I mean Mother.

1621
02:17:51,604 --> 02:17:53,993
We're going to sing
in the festival tonight.

1622
02:17:54,199 --> 02:17:56,238
We've been having a lovely time!

1623
02:17:56,500 --> 02:17:58,474
We've been rehearsing all...

1624
02:17:59,922 --> 02:18:02,164
Surprise! Surprise!

1625
02:18:02,806 --> 02:18:05,196
Surprises for you on the terrace.

1626
02:18:08,114 --> 02:18:09,456
We'll talk about this.

1627
02:18:09,650 --> 02:18:13,777
I would've told you but you were away.
I had to make a last-minute decision.

1628
02:18:14,036 --> 02:18:16,428
I was fortunate to enter them at all.

1629
02:18:16,660 --> 02:18:21,199
They'll be the talk of the festival.
Imagine, seven children in one family!

1630
02:18:21,393 --> 02:18:22,956
Max!

1631
02:18:23,542 --> 02:18:26,259
Somehow I recall having made it
quite clear to you...

1632
02:18:26,517 --> 02:18:29,071
...how I feel about my family
singing in public!

1633
02:18:29,333 --> 02:18:30,956
The committee was enchanted.

1634
02:18:31,157 --> 02:18:34,192
- What did they say?
- I have never heard such enthusiasm.

1635
02:18:34,454 --> 02:18:38,574
- Don't you think just this once...?
- Absolutely out of the question.

1636
02:18:38,802 --> 02:18:42,765
- Georg, this is for Austria.
- For Austria?

1637
02:18:43,126 --> 02:18:46,259
- There is no Austria!
- But the Anschluss was peaceful.

1638
02:18:46,486 --> 02:18:49,796
- Let's at least be grateful for that.
- Grateful?

1639
02:18:51,603 --> 02:18:53,199
You know, Max...

1640
02:18:54,037 --> 02:18:57,166
...sometimes I don't believe
I know you.

1641
02:18:59,731 --> 02:19:01,039
Father, I forgot.

1642
02:19:01,843 --> 02:19:03,372
This is for you.

1643
02:19:12,757 --> 02:19:16,586
Maria, he has got to at least pretend
to work with these people.

1644
02:19:16,852 --> 02:19:18,313
You must convince him.

1645
02:19:18,515 --> 02:19:21,165
Max, I can't ask him
to be less than he is.

1646
02:19:21,395 --> 02:19:24,561
Then I'll talk to him.
If the children don't sing, well...

1647
02:19:24,820 --> 02:19:26,958
...it will be a reflection
on Austria.

1648
02:19:27,730 --> 02:19:30,958
Oh, I know.
It wouldn't do me any good either.

1649
02:19:35,924 --> 02:19:38,475
Mother? That sounds so nice.

1650
02:19:38,737 --> 02:19:41,356
- I like calling you "Mother."
- I like hearing it.

1651
02:19:41,553 --> 02:19:45,134
You love Father very much.
I can tell you do.

1652
02:19:45,334 --> 02:19:46,096
Very much.

1653
02:19:46,356 --> 02:19:49,519
Mother, what do you do when you
think you love someone?

1654
02:19:50,192 --> 02:19:55,283
I mean, when you stop loving someone
or he stops loving you?

1655
02:19:57,778 --> 02:19:59,753
Well, you cry a little.

1656
02:20:00,177 --> 02:20:02,187
Then you wait for the sun to come out.

1657
02:20:02,485 --> 02:20:03,763
It always does.

1658
02:20:04,021 --> 02:20:07,433
There are so many things I think
I should know but I don't.

1659
02:20:07,634 --> 02:20:09,523
- I really don't.
- How can you?

1660
02:20:09,778 --> 02:20:11,883
Sometimes I feel the world is ending.

1661
02:20:12,117 --> 02:20:15,215
- Then you feel it's just beginning?
- Yes!

1662
02:20:15,413 --> 02:20:19,470
It was that way with me. And for you
it will be just as wonderful.

1663
02:20:20,114 --> 02:20:21,936
Do you really think so?

1664
02:20:22,804 --> 02:20:26,578
When you're 16 going on 17

1665
02:20:26,836 --> 02:20:30,281
Waiting for life to start

1666
02:20:30,928 --> 02:20:34,609
Somebody kind
Who touches your mind

1667
02:20:34,834 --> 02:20:38,957
Will suddenly touch your heart

1668
02:20:39,379 --> 02:20:41,002
When that happens

1669
02:20:41,456 --> 02:20:43,315
After it happens

1670
02:20:43,541 --> 02:20:47,249
Nothing is quite the same

1671
02:20:47,473 --> 02:20:48,967
Somehow I know

1672
02:20:49,234 --> 02:20:51,273
I'll jump up and go

1673
02:20:51,475 --> 02:20:55,601
If ever he calls my name

1674
02:20:55,861 --> 02:20:59,600
Gone are your old ideas of life

1675
02:20:59,857 --> 02:21:03,885
The old ideas grow dim

1676
02:21:04,115 --> 02:21:08,336
Lo and behold
You're someone's wife

1677
02:21:09,233 --> 02:21:14,985
And you belong to him

1678
02:21:15,283 --> 02:21:19,405
You may think this kind of adventure

1679
02:21:19,599 --> 02:21:23,312
Never may come to you

1680
02:21:24,371 --> 02:21:29,519
Darling, 16 going on 17

1681
02:21:30,320 --> 02:21:34,286
Wait a year...

1682
02:21:35,060 --> 02:21:40,077
- I'll wait a year
...or two

1683
02:21:40,497 --> 02:21:47,536
Just wait a year...

1684
02:21:48,368 --> 02:21:56,652
...or two

1685
02:21:58,960 --> 02:22:00,487
Liesl.

1686
02:22:16,275 --> 02:22:17,551
What is it?

1687
02:22:18,447 --> 02:22:19,758
Berlin.

1688
02:22:20,209 --> 02:22:22,000
They've offered me a commission.

1689
02:22:22,259 --> 02:22:24,680
I've been requested
to accept immediately...

1690
02:22:24,915 --> 02:22:28,743
...and report to their naval base
at Bremerhaven tomorrow.

1691
02:22:29,327 --> 02:22:33,159
I knew this would happen.
I didn't think it would be so soon.

1692
02:22:33,395 --> 02:22:36,744
To refuse them would be fatal
for all of us.

1693
02:22:37,936 --> 02:22:41,548
And joining them would be unthinkable.

1694
02:22:47,475 --> 02:22:49,163
Get the children all together.

1695
02:22:49,488 --> 02:22:52,556
Don't say anything to worry them.
Just get them ready.

1696
02:22:53,490 --> 02:22:55,758
We've got to get out of Austria...

1697
02:22:57,362 --> 02:22:58,953
...and this house...

1698
02:23:01,197 --> 02:23:02,576
...tonight.

1699
02:23:44,690 --> 02:23:46,991
This strains my back
and breaks my heart...

1700
02:23:47,248 --> 02:23:49,963
...when I think of the children
missing the festival.

1701
02:23:50,255 --> 02:23:52,811
By your announcement
we'll be over the border.

1702
02:23:53,043 --> 02:23:55,375
Do you appreciate
the sacrifice I'm making?

1703
02:23:55,570 --> 02:23:56,813
You have no choice.

1704
02:23:57,039 --> 02:23:59,755
I know. That's why I'm making it.

1705
02:24:00,432 --> 02:24:02,471
Why doesn't Father turn the motor on?

1706
02:24:02,672 --> 02:24:05,968
Because he doesn't want anyone
to hear us.

1707
02:24:09,454 --> 02:24:11,788
What will Frau Schmidt and Franz say?

1708
02:24:12,047 --> 02:24:15,432
They'll be able to answer honestly
they didn't know anything.

1709
02:24:15,635 --> 02:24:19,690
- Will we be coming back here?
- Someday, Liesl. I do hope someday.

1710
02:24:19,919 --> 02:24:24,656
Are Father and Uncle Max going to push
the car all the way to Switzerland?

1711
02:24:50,349 --> 02:24:52,653
Something wrong
with your car, captain?

1712
02:24:52,975 --> 02:24:55,148
Yes, we couldn't get it started.

1713
02:24:58,767 --> 02:24:59,945
Karl.

1714
02:25:01,838 --> 02:25:05,190
Fix Captain von Trapp's car
so that it will start.

1715
02:25:27,438 --> 02:25:29,160
Excellent, Karl.

1716
02:25:32,400 --> 02:25:35,433
I've not asked you where you
and your family are going.

1717
02:25:35,922 --> 02:25:37,961
Nor have you asked me why I'm here.

1718
02:25:38,160 --> 02:25:41,769
Apparently we both suffer
from a deplorable lack of curiosity.

1719
02:25:42,609 --> 02:25:44,976
You never answered the telegram...

1720
02:25:45,201 --> 02:25:48,362
...from the Admiral of the Navy
of the Third Reich.

1721
02:25:48,587 --> 02:25:50,958
I was under the impression,
Herr Zeller...

1722
02:25:51,214 --> 02:25:54,563
...that the contents of telegrams
in Austria are private!

1723
02:25:55,249 --> 02:25:58,626
At least, the Austria I know.

1724
02:25:59,728 --> 02:26:01,285
I have my orders...

1725
02:26:01,515 --> 02:26:03,591
...to take you
to Bremerhaven tonight...

1726
02:26:03,857 --> 02:26:05,963
...where you will accept
your commission.

1727
02:26:07,056 --> 02:26:12,271
I'm afraid that's going to be
quite impossible.

1728
02:26:12,847 --> 02:26:14,505
You see, we...

1729
02:26:15,056 --> 02:26:17,772
...all of us, the entire family,
will be...

1730
02:26:18,797 --> 02:26:20,737
...singing in the festival tonight.

1731
02:26:21,037 --> 02:26:23,405
As a matter of fact, we're going now.

1732
02:26:24,018 --> 02:26:26,765
We couldn't possibly
let them down now.

1733
02:26:26,960 --> 02:26:29,804
- I just hope we're not too late.
- Yes.

1734
02:26:30,029 --> 02:26:32,813
You ask me to believe that you,
Captain von Trapp...

1735
02:26:33,040 --> 02:26:34,445
...are singing in a concert?

1736
02:26:34,830 --> 02:26:38,789
Believe me, it will be a performance
beyond anything even I've dreamt of.

1737
02:26:39,150 --> 02:26:43,591
Like you, Herr Zeller,
I, too, am a man of hidden talents.

1738
02:26:44,271 --> 02:26:45,549
Yes.

1739
02:26:45,808 --> 02:26:48,195
Here, program.

1740
02:26:53,008 --> 02:26:55,245
It says only the names
of the children.

1741
02:26:55,473 --> 02:26:58,600
It says
the von Trapp Family Singers...

1742
02:26:58,827 --> 02:27:01,761
...and I am the head of
the von Trapp family, am I not?

1743
02:27:03,950 --> 02:27:07,596
And these travel clothes
that you're all wearing?

1744
02:27:08,400 --> 02:27:09,858
Our costumes, naturally.

1745
02:27:10,126 --> 02:27:13,389
This night air is not good
for the children's voices.

1746
02:27:19,373 --> 02:27:22,757
Well, a slight delay in my orders
will not be serious.

1747
02:27:23,919 --> 02:27:25,381
Therefore...

1748
02:27:26,192 --> 02:27:27,750
...you will sing.

1749
02:27:28,653 --> 02:27:30,562
You will all sing.

1750
02:27:30,924 --> 02:27:33,348
But only because that's what I want.

1751
02:27:34,255 --> 02:27:37,550
It will demonstrate that nothing
in Austria has changed.

1752
02:27:38,254 --> 02:27:40,356
And when you have finished singing...

1753
02:27:40,652 --> 02:27:43,687
...you, Captain von Trapp, will be
taken to Bremerhaven.

1754
02:27:44,908 --> 02:27:47,530
Now, if you will all get
into your car...

1755
02:27:47,759 --> 02:27:51,434
...we will escort the von Trapp Family
Singers to the festival.

1756
02:27:52,269 --> 02:27:54,343
No escort will be necessary.

1757
02:27:54,574 --> 02:27:56,961
Necessary? A pleasure, captain.

1758
02:27:57,839 --> 02:28:01,545
After all, we would not want you
to get lost in the crowds.

1759
02:28:02,734 --> 02:28:04,163
Would we?

1760
02:28:04,814 --> 02:28:05,929
No.

1761
02:28:21,484 --> 02:28:24,519
Sew, a needle pulling thread

1762
02:28:24,717 --> 02:28:27,784
La, a note to follow sew

1763
02:28:28,045 --> 02:28:31,361
Tea, a drink with jam and bread

1764
02:28:31,565 --> 02:28:35,207
A drink with jam and bread

1765
02:28:44,398 --> 02:28:46,471
Tea with jam
Jam and bread

1766
02:28:52,105 --> 02:28:55,304
- With jam
- A, B, C

1767
02:28:55,535 --> 02:28:58,633
- With jam
- Do-re-mi

1768
02:28:58,829 --> 02:29:02,273
Tea with jam and bread

1769
02:29:02,508 --> 02:29:03,786
With jam and bread

1770
02:29:04,046 --> 02:29:05,508
With jam
With jam...

1771
02:29:05,711 --> 02:29:14,154
...and bread

1772
02:29:35,243 --> 02:29:38,246
My fellow Austrians...

1773
02:29:39,466 --> 02:29:43,843
...I shall not be seeing you again,
perhaps for a very long time.

1774
02:29:45,195 --> 02:29:46,790
I would like to sing for you now...

1775
02:29:48,331 --> 02:29:49,826
...a love song.

1776
02:29:51,722 --> 02:29:53,831
I know you share this love.

1777
02:29:55,085 --> 02:29:58,630
I pray that you will never let it die.

1778
02:30:10,890 --> 02:30:14,274
Edelweiss

1779
02:30:14,476 --> 02:30:17,542
Edelweiss

1780
02:30:17,804 --> 02:30:23,303
Every morning you greet me

1781
02:30:23,694 --> 02:30:26,628
Small and white

1782
02:30:26,892 --> 02:30:29,542
Clean and bright

1783
02:30:30,089 --> 02:30:34,979
You look happy to meet me

1784
02:30:35,725 --> 02:30:37,666
Blossom of snow

1785
02:30:37,932 --> 02:30:41,376
May you bloom and grow

1786
02:30:41,609 --> 02:30:47,044
Bloom and grow forever

1787
02:30:48,491 --> 02:30:50,879
Edelweiss

1788
02:30:51,113 --> 02:30:53,636
Edelweiss

1789
02:30:53,835 --> 02:30:59,585
Bless my homeland forever

1790
02:31:03,917 --> 02:31:06,884
Edelweiss

1791
02:31:07,115 --> 02:31:08,392
Edel...

1792
02:31:15,466 --> 02:31:18,433
Small and white

1793
02:31:18,635 --> 02:31:21,380
Clean and bright

1794
02:31:21,608 --> 02:31:26,732
You look happy to meet me

1795
02:31:27,530 --> 02:31:29,418
Blossom of snow

1796
02:31:29,611 --> 02:31:32,874
May you bloom and grow

1797
02:31:33,515 --> 02:31:39,265
Bloom and grow forever

1798
02:31:39,723 --> 02:31:42,505
Edelweiss

1799
02:31:42,795 --> 02:31:45,445
Edelweiss

1800
02:31:46,028 --> 02:31:53,924
Bless my homeland forever

1801
02:32:10,920 --> 02:32:12,414
I think it'll work.

1802
02:32:13,130 --> 02:32:14,823
I shall miss all of you.

1803
02:32:15,306 --> 02:32:17,640
I shall miss the money
I could have made with you.

1804
02:32:20,905 --> 02:32:22,399
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

1805
02:32:23,113 --> 02:32:25,666
The competition has come
to its conclusion...

1806
02:32:25,932 --> 02:32:28,899
...except, we don't know
yet what that conclusion will be.

1807
02:32:29,836 --> 02:32:32,254
And while the judges
arrive at their decision...

1808
02:32:32,522 --> 02:32:35,423
...I have been given permission
to offer you an encore.

1809
02:32:35,690 --> 02:32:38,756
This will be the last opportunity
the von Trapps will have...

1810
02:32:38,986 --> 02:32:41,285
...of singing together
for a long, long time.

1811
02:32:42,312 --> 02:32:46,143
Even now, officials are waiting
in this auditorium...

1812
02:32:46,410 --> 02:32:49,028
...to escort Captain von Trapp
to his new command...

1813
02:32:49,226 --> 02:32:52,642
...in the naval forces
of the Third Reich.

1814
02:32:57,131 --> 02:33:01,467
And so, ladies and gentlemen,
the family von Trapp again...

1815
02:33:02,088 --> 02:33:04,263
...to bid you farewell.

1816
02:33:11,208 --> 02:33:14,656
There's a sad sort of clanging
From the clock in the hall

1817
02:33:14,923 --> 02:33:18,119
And the bells in the steeple too

1818
02:33:18,602 --> 02:33:22,312
And up in the nursery
An absurd little bird

1819
02:33:22,505 --> 02:33:24,838
Is popping out to say "coo-coo"

1820
02:33:25,035 --> 02:33:26,628
Coo-coo

1821
02:33:26,891 --> 02:33:27,836
Coo-coo

1822
02:33:28,105 --> 02:33:29,631
Regretfully they tell us

1823
02:33:29,833 --> 02:33:31,553
But firmly they compel us

1824
02:33:31,781 --> 02:33:34,437
To say goodbye

1825
02:33:34,634 --> 02:33:39,587
To you

1826
02:33:42,440 --> 02:33:45,822
So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, good night

1827
02:33:46,091 --> 02:33:49,667
We hate to go
And miss this pretty sight

1828
02:33:55,592 --> 02:33:59,041
So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, adieu

1829
02:33:59,242 --> 02:34:02,755
Adieu, adieu
To you and you and you

1830
02:34:08,808 --> 02:34:12,254
So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye

1831
02:34:12,488 --> 02:34:14,016
We flit, we float

1832
02:34:14,281 --> 02:34:15,873
We fleetly flee, we fly

1833
02:34:21,989 --> 02:34:25,635
So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye

1834
02:34:25,830 --> 02:34:29,061
The sun has gone to bed
And so must I

1835
02:34:29,322 --> 02:34:32,965
Goodbye

1836
02:34:33,194 --> 02:34:38,660
Goodbye

1837
02:34:38,888 --> 02:34:43,874
Goodbye

1838
02:34:44,104 --> 02:34:50,975
Goodbye

1839
02:35:21,478 --> 02:35:25,441
Ladies and gentlemen, I have here the
decision of our distinguished judges.

1840
02:35:25,640 --> 02:35:28,095
We will start with the award
for third prize.

1841
02:35:28,713 --> 02:35:30,946
For this honor,
the judges have named...

1842
02:35:31,208 --> 02:35:35,616
...the first soloist of the choir
of St. Agatha's Church in Murback.

1843
02:35:35,878 --> 02:35:38,018
Fraulein Schweiger.

1844
02:36:13,449 --> 02:36:17,223
Second prize
to The Toby Reiser Quintet.

1845
02:36:44,037 --> 02:36:48,032
And the first prize,
the highest honor in all Austria...

1846
02:36:48,263 --> 02:36:51,228
...the von Trapp Family Singers.

1847
02:37:03,113 --> 02:37:04,704
The family von Trapp.

1848
02:37:18,728 --> 02:37:19,742
They're gone!

1849
02:37:37,671 --> 02:37:39,044
Come with me.

1850
02:37:42,726 --> 02:37:44,637
Quickly, quickly.

1851
02:37:45,510 --> 02:37:47,615
I have a place you can hide.

1852
02:37:48,327 --> 02:37:51,456
Slowly, slowly.

1853
02:38:01,987 --> 02:38:03,617
Open this gate.

1854
02:38:04,711 --> 02:38:06,236
Good evening.

1855
02:38:08,647 --> 02:38:10,019
Hurry up, woman.

1856
02:38:29,061 --> 02:38:30,272
Two men in there.

1857
02:38:30,472 --> 02:38:32,255
Six of you cover the yard.

1858
02:38:32,483 --> 02:38:34,626
You two, cover the corridor.

1859
02:38:48,517 --> 02:38:51,928
Reverend Mother, we didn't realize
we put the abbey in this danger.

1860
02:38:52,192 --> 02:38:54,619
No, Maria, it was right for you
to come here.

1861
02:38:54,822 --> 02:38:56,645
We thought we might borrow
your car.

1862
02:38:56,839 --> 02:38:58,661
I'm afraid our car will do you
no good now.

1863
02:38:59,236 --> 02:39:00,832
I've been listening to the wires.

1864
02:39:01,031 --> 02:39:03,451
The borders have just been closed.

1865
02:39:09,063 --> 02:39:11,264
All right,
if the borders are closed...

1866
02:39:12,513 --> 02:39:15,680
...then we'll drive up into the hills
and go over the mountains on foot.

1867
02:39:16,260 --> 02:39:18,170
- The children...
- We'll help them.

1868
02:39:18,435 --> 02:39:20,509
We can do it without help, Father.

1869
02:39:21,508 --> 02:39:22,817
Maria.

1870
02:39:23,524 --> 02:39:26,013
You will not be alone.
Remember:

1871
02:39:26,245 --> 02:39:29,211
"I will lift up mine eyes unto
the hills from whence cometh my help."

1872
02:39:30,148 --> 02:39:31,196
Yes, Mother.

1873
02:39:32,514 --> 02:39:34,588
- I'm scared.
- Me too.

1874
02:39:46,182 --> 02:39:47,294
God be with you.

1875
02:39:53,957 --> 02:39:55,450
- Mother.
- Yes?

1876
02:39:55,683 --> 02:39:58,750
Would it help if we sang
about our favorite things?

1877
02:39:58,981 --> 02:40:01,847
No, darling.
This is one time it would not help.

1878
02:40:02,114 --> 02:40:05,183
You must be very quiet.
Hold tight to me.

1879
02:42:14,341 --> 02:42:15,518
Let's try the roof.

1880
02:43:09,475 --> 02:43:11,613
Rolfe, please.

1881
02:43:16,513 --> 02:43:17,942
No, wait.

1882
02:43:27,363 --> 02:43:28,639
Maria.

1883
02:43:29,666 --> 02:43:31,041
Children.

1884
02:43:34,914 --> 02:43:37,816
It's you we want, not them.

1885
02:43:38,178 --> 02:43:39,838
Put that down.

1886
02:43:40,864 --> 02:43:44,029
Not another move,
or I'll shoot.

1887
02:43:45,665 --> 02:43:47,607
You're only a boy.

1888
02:43:50,499 --> 02:43:54,012
- You don't really belong to them.
- Stay where you are.

1889
02:43:55,712 --> 02:43:57,625
Come away with us.

1890
02:43:58,817 --> 02:43:59,931
Before it's too late.

1891
02:44:00,512 --> 02:44:02,746
Not another step.
I'll kill you.

1892
02:44:04,962 --> 02:44:08,157
- You give that to me, Rolfe.
- Did you hear me?

1893
02:44:09,123 --> 02:44:10,615
I'll kill you.

1894
02:44:12,417 --> 02:44:13,824
Rolfe.

1895
02:44:31,459 --> 02:44:32,731
You'll never be one of them.

1896
02:44:35,392 --> 02:44:37,018
Lieutenant!

1897
02:44:37,282 --> 02:44:38,360
They're here!

1898
02:44:38,562 --> 02:44:40,056
They're here, lieutenant!

1899
02:45:19,681 --> 02:45:21,273
Reverend Mother.

1900
02:45:22,495 --> 02:45:24,251
I have sinned.

1901
02:45:25,379 --> 02:45:27,451
I too, Reverend Mother.

1902
02:45:29,026 --> 02:45:31,263
What is this sin, my children?

1903
02:46:48,005 --> 02:46:58,951
