1
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,789
There’s one thing you should know if
you want to make money in business:

2
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,589
Nothing is about luck.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,629
Negotiations are a game.
You have to know your opponent.

4
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,110
Or you risk losing everything.

5
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,796
If you don't hate losing,
you'll never be successful or rich.

6
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,273
But the boundary of ethics can
sometimes be stretched to its limit.

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,590
Our partner, Morgan Nordenstråle,

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,072
had crossed the line once too many.
We couldn't take it anymore.

9
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,198
We have to look over
the third quarter.

10
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,593
I told you to empty out your office
and turn in your keys.

11
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,629
- My father built this company.
- And you almost tore it down.

12
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,634
- All this Caesar Batanga stuff, I...
- Wouldn't it be best...

13
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,554
Get out of here
before I call the guard.

14
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,189
Thomas...

15
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,919
I'm... I'm just going to get
a picture of my family that I forgot.

16
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,278
- I don't think we should pressure him.
- He's sick, I want him out of here.

17
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,479
I never want to see
that lunatic again.

18
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,671
7 YEARS LATER

19
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,477
Like Isaid,
we couldn’t take anymore.

20
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,428
Morgan got us involved
with the IT company Cataegis-

21
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:51,915
- and used unacceptable methods to
convince the owner, Batanga, to sell.

22
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,757
A few days later, Batanga was
found dead. He'd hanged himself.

23
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,109
It was a tragedy, but as it turned
out, the business deal was a success.

24
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,592
Cataegis was the best investment
we'd ever made.

25
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,389
Today, it's one of the largest
IT companies in Europe.

26
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,237
The shares have gone up several
hundred percent since going public.

27
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,588
Our company, Nova Investment,
is a venture capital company.

28
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,878
We invest our clients’ money
in companies that show potential

29
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,589
and then sell our share at a profit.

30
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:39,996
The deal was to sell our shares and
leave Cataegis after a certain time.

31
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,799
And that time is now.

32
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,709
Soon, we can put this shareholders'
meeting and fiscal year behind us,

33
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,713
and look back on a fun
and exciting year.

34
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,555
Exciting because we
introduced new services,

35
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,840
and fun because not only
did profits increase, costs decreased.

36
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,434
We can now turn
our attention to...

37
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,196
Why is Nova Investment selling
if everything is going so well?

38
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,673
Maybe because that's when you sell.
I don't feel it's my place to answer.

39
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,710
I'll turn the question over to their
representative: Thomas Skepphult.

40
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:27,796
Thanks. We've never made a secret
of our intent to exit Cataegis.

41
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:34,115
- I'm against the sale.
- All shares will go up 30%.

42
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,478
My opinion is that Extreme Capital
Group's agenda and reputation,

43
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,509
are incompatible
with Cataegis' goals.

44
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,639
They've built their company
by making unethical investments.

45
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,635
I can assure you that Extreme
Capital Group's goals and interests,

46
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,550
both ethical and financial,
are the same...

47
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,835
The agreement says Nova Investment
needs 60% ownership in order to sell.

48
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,199
You only have 40%.
I demand that we take a vote.

49
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,558
I guess we'll have to vote.

50
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:19,511
But in order to do that
we're going to need a few minutes.

51
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,913
Gabriel Mörk is talking about morals.
It's enough to make you want to puke.

52
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,277
Gabriel Mörk.

53
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,878
A master negotiator who always
finds his opponents’ weaknesses.

54
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,077
I didn't know
your morality was so strong.

55
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,676
Morality sells, didn't you know?

56
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,594
What are you smiling about?

57
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,469
Why didn't you consider my offer
for Cataegis?

58
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:00,873
- Because we got a better one.
- Don't try that with me.

59
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,635
Nova Investment
is going to invest in GM Oil.

60
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:11,114
If Swedish ownership increases I may
have to pay taxes. I don't want that.

61
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,633
That's why we're here.
You want my 25% for the vote

62
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,271
and I want you nowhere near
my oil company.

63
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,600
We're canceling the vote
because, as it turns out,

64
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:35,915
Nova Investment has the necessary
votes needed to sell their shares...

65
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,356
We're not going for GM Oil.

66
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:46,915
You're responsible for everything
being in place for Monday's signing.

67
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,878
Of course.

68
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,111
I'll see you on Monday.

69
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,154
Here are the candles.

70
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,633
Where will you put them?
There's no space anywhere.

71
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,435
- Can you take the present?
- No.

72
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,674
- It's better if you take it. I swear.
- I'm not doing it.

73
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,230
I'll take the cake.

74
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,598
- You'll have to teach her.
- Look at the cake!

75
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,956
Happy birthday, Ebba.

76
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,669
What could it be?

77
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,034
Can I see?

78
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,594
- A horse.
- Your horse.

79
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,359
We couldn't bring it,
but we're going to the stables later.

80
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,558
You know horses
require a lot of work, right?

81
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,238
- I'll help you, sweetheart.
- I think we should sing to Ebba.

82
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,076
Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you...

83
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,878
No, that one.

84
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,351
- That one?
- Yes, that one.

85
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,518
Should we see what it is?

86
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,195
It's so pretty.

87
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,150
It's not just any heart.
It's a magical heart from olden days.

88
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,993
Shall we put it on?

89
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,875
Do you know why it's a magical heart?
Do you want to know?

90
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,559
If there’s something
you really want to know, but don't...

91
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,348
...just put this on
and you'll know everything.

92
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,479
- What are you talking about?
- I got a magical heart.

93
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,872
How pretty. Did dad give you that?

94
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,029
I want to speak to Thomas in private.

95
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,395
Of course.

96
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:17,954
- How come they brought this up now?
- The question is, what do they know?

97
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,470
Damn.

98
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,597
- I'm leaving now.
- Okay.

99
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,950
Karin?

100
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,353
- Did Wilhelm tell you where he went?
- To Strandvägen.

101
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,156
Neither Karl nor Louise
know about this.

102
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,793
Much less the hidden compartment.

103
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,355
- You said you'd destroyed the tape.
- I know.

104
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,592
- Why did you keep it?
- I never meant to.

105
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,914
Do you want to have a look?
Are you sure?

106
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,194
Would you like a drink?

107
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,550
Everything will work out with Cataegis.

108
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,439
Don't you worry.

109
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,115
I've been meaning to talk to you
about something.

110
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,990
- It's time that you took over.
- What are you saying?

111
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,073
There's a time for everything, Thomas.

112
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,232
But why? I mean, why?

113
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:16,793
- Because it's time.
- "It's time"? What are you saying?

114
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,350
It's not that big of a deal.

115
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:25,674
What's happening with you?
You can't just up and quit.

116
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,549
And the tape
that you should have gotten rid of.

117
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,439
Calm down.

118
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,276
- I want to spent time with my family.
- That's bullshit!

119
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,876
- Your marriage is beyond salvation.
- What was that?

120
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,917
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean it that way.

121
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,796
Naturally, I won't leave
until everything is resolved.

122
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,076
Trust me.

123
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,353
You must be
Wilhelm Rahmberg's wife.

124
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,513
- Hi, by the way. I'm Diana Malm.
- Louise.

125
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,834
Have you eaten, Ebba?

126
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,519
I'm sorry, Louise.

127
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:42,834
Do you know if Rahmberg
had any enemies?

128
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,355
No.

129
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,433
- No, I don't think so.
- Think carefully.

130
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:01,395
In crimes such as these, the motive,
nine times out often, is emotional,

131
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:07,749
like hate, jealousy
or it's quite simply for financial gain.

132
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,590
- You met with Rahmberg last night.
- Yes.

133
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,392
- What did you do?
- We talked, about...

134
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,358
...well, business.

135
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,752
Rahmberg was planning to retire.

136
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,038
How did you feel about that?

137
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,869
Naturally, I thought it was a shame.

138
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,397
He's been my mentor, my partner...

139
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,750
...and my friend
for the past fifteen years.

140
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,675
We found a contract
in a safe at Rahmberg's place.

141
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,278
The contract states
that if one partner dies, the other,

142
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,991
can buy that partner's share
for two million.

143
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:18,030
It's not unusual to draw up contracts
like that when the company is new.

144
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:25,276
All your energy is focused on
making the business grow.

145
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,788
As I understand it, Nova Investment's
investments are worth ten billion.

146
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:38,513
And according to the contract,
you get sole control over all this.

147
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,470
If you suspect me of anything,
I'd like to be told.

148
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,952
I suggest that you
call your lawyer.

149
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,075
Are you suggesting
that I killed him?

150
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:07,674
- The Philip Ceder Law Firm.
- Thomas Skepphult for Philip Ceder.

151
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,990
One moment, please.

152
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,548
Thomas.

153
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:21,398
- Is Philip Ceder there?
- I'm back to settle old debts.

154
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:26,998
- Who am I speaking to?
- Don't you recognize my voice?

155
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,756
No.
Can I please speak to Philip Ceder?

156
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:38,393
- That may present a problem.
- Is this a bad joke? Who are you?

157
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,758
Thomas, Thomas, Thomas.
First Caesar Batanga

158
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,832
and then me and now Wilhelm.

159
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,879
That wasn't very bright, now was it?

160
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,229
Hello?

161
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,472
- Are you still there?
- Who is this?

162
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,953
I've followed you through the years.
You're getting better. Quite impressive.

163
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,478
It was a mistake to take her last name.
You found it sounded better, I'm sure.

164
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,679
But you must know
that you can't outrun yourself.

165
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,355
I know what kind of man you are.

166
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:23,310
Like I said,
it's time to settle old debts.

167
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,712
I'm standing outside
Nova Investment.

168
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,273
Sources tell us the police have arrested
Rahmberg's partner, Thomas Skepphult.

169
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:47,516
We have no confirmation if he is
a suspect in Rahmberg's murder...

170
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,148
This is absurd.

171
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,359
Don't you think you should
come stay with me for a while?

172
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,717
- Why?
- You can see for yourself.

173
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,512
You have contacts in the police
department. Tell them it's a mistake.

174
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,717
- I've spoken to them.
- And?

175
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:18,429
They said they'd never do all this if
they believed Thomas was innocent.

176
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:23,151
- And what did you say?
- If you had only listened to me.

177
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,518
They've found conclusive evidence.

178
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,719
- Anna?
- I want you to leave now.

179
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,830
I want you to know that I
will always be there for you and Ebba.

180
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,150
Always.

181
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,515
My client was redirected
when he tried to call me today.

182
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:00,310
He talked to a person
who my client believes killed Rahmberg.

183
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,350
- My client was also threatened.
- Threatened? How?

184
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:12,834
Essentially, this man said
that my client is next.

185
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,712
- Who were you redirected to?
- He claimed to be Morgan Nordenstråle.

186
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:26,433
- Why would someone want to claim that?
- I don't know.

187
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,672
Why can't it be Nordenstråle?

188
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,752
Because he's dead,
he killed himself.

189
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:37,550
I think you should check out this call.
Are we done?

190
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:43,795
We found a crowbar missing
from the tools in the garage.

191
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,829
It was just like the one
used in the murder.

192
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,071
Anything else?

193
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,916
The prosecutor wants him arrested
for the murder of Wilhelm Rahmberg.

194
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,232
Shouldn't you
check out the call first?

195
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,154
The fingerprints on the crowbar
belong to your client.

196
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,677
It could have been stolen
and planted on the scene.

197
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:16,392
My client is innocent. He will make
himself available to the police.

198
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,518
We're talking about his friend...

199
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:52,596
It's time for your arraignment.
And you have a call from your lawyer.

200
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,354
Right here.

201
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,190
- Hi, Philip.
- Your beautiful wife looks a bit tired.

202
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,396
Who was the man whose head
you blew away?

203
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:15,789
Do you approve of her smoking?
I remember you as a clean living sort.

204
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,909
- What do you want?
- Access codes for the offshore account.

205
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,675
- What offshore account?
- You know.

206
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,469
The one you have
at least 75 million in.

207
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,794
Charming girl, that Ebba. She's
advanced for her age, very talkative.

208
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:39,080
- She mentioned a magical heart.
- You're sick.

209
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,152
What's my guarantee
you won't hurt my family?

210
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,758
Guarantee? Since when did that word
hold any meaning for you?

211
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,992
The access codes, please.

212
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,789
- I don't have them on me.
- You have an hour.

213
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,396
- Then the guarantee runs out.
- What are you saying?

214
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:04,395
- One hour.
- What will happen then?

215
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,033
- There's no one there.
- I have to call...

216
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,158
- We're leaving.
- I have to call my wife.

217
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:17,199
- Take it easy.
- I have to call my wife!

218
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,069
What are you doing?
I have to call my wife.

219
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,673
Listen to me,
I really have to call my wife.

220
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,479
Can you just be quiet?

221
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,154
Wait here. Wait.

222
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:50,752
- How much to let me use the phone?
- Shut up. Okay?

223
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,999
What the hell are you doing?!

224
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,635
Damn!

225
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,349
ENTER PIN CODE

226
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,110
Hey!

227
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,558
Do you have a phone I can borrow?
I need a phone.

228
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,915
Stop! Grab him!

229
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,753
Stop that man!

230
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,153
- Did you hear?
- What?

231
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:38,314
- Thomas Skepphult escaped.
- What the hell are you saying?

232
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,115
Dammit!

233
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,789
It's not my fault.

234
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,157
- Where's the damn kid?
- It's happening.

235
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,189
- What does that mean? Where is she?
- They'll be there soon.

236
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:03,674
He can't find the place. What is he
supposed to do, call the cops?

237
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,159
I promised you I'd take care of this.
I've done it before, right?

238
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,760
I'm sorry, Ahmed.

239
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:21,753
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
I was hasty.

240
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:27,950
I don't want you to think me unfair.
Come on, hit me and we're even.

241
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,873
- This isn't business.
- Hit me.

242
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:35,113
Not until you've paid me.

243
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,635
Pay you?

244
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,156
Just get the damn kid.

245
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:10,109
I can't sing anymore,
I'm getting hoarse.

246
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,632
- Hello.
- Hi. Is your husband here?

247
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:34,629
He's escaped and we were wondering
if we could come in?

248
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:46,077
- Has your husband contacted you?
- No.

249
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,950
- Why would he escape?
- I have no idea.

250
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,398
- He says he didn't kill Rahmberg.
- Of course he didn't.

251
00:31:55,560 --> 00:32:00,111
Who do you think might help him?

252
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:04,990
- Is he going to flee the country?
- Flee?

253
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,871
How long did you say
he'd known Wilhelm?

254
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,508
I didn't. 15-16 years.

255
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:18,357
Do you know if they met before
or after Thomas's jail time?

256
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,273
I don't know.

257
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,796
Please call me
if he contacts you.

258
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,157
I checked out Nordenstråle.

259
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:50,314
Turns out his mother
identified the body.

260
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,429
- Why does Skepphult claim he's alive?
- He's lying. I know the type.

261
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:02,233
It's always about money.
We have to dig deeper into his affairs.

262
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,957
- Anna.
- Why aren't you answering?

263
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:36,830
- Meet me in the street with Ebba.
- What are you doing?

264
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,629
- Just do what I say!
- Why did you escape?

265
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:45,954
Just do what I tell you!
Meet me in the street!

266
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,030
I forgot my magic heart!

267
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,674
Anna!

268
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,317
- Yes?
- Take your car to the office. Now!

269
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,391
Okay.

270
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:29,438
Fabian von Klercking.
Where are you? What's going on?

271
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,388
I'm on the boat.
Listen, can you help me?

272
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,838
- Fabian?
- Yes, of course. With what?

273
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,393
Anna and Ebba are on their way,
can you take care of them?

274
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,711
A man called Preben Smed...

275
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,873
A Dane called Preben Smed...

276
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:57,273
He'll be there in three hours to take
care of my family until this is over.

277
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,309
Philip told me about that
wrong connection. Is it true?

278
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:09,079
Of course! Listen, the only important
thing is that you take care of them.

279
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,708
I promise. Hey...

280
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:19,036
- Do you want me to check it out for you?
- I'd appreciate it if you could.

281
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,909
- Take care.
- Fabian? Thanks.

282
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,389
No problem.

283
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,952
The family got away.
I just don't understand it, Thomas...

284
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,270
You look like hell.

285
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,159
You're gray.

286
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:27,277
- How are they?
- They're fine.

287
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,069
Thanks for helping out,
I really need it right now.

288
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:36,997
You know it's going to cost you.
One million per week.

289
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:43,599
- Do you have that kind of money?
- Yes. Anna will have to get it for you.

290
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,309
- Great.
- But she doesn't know where it is.

291
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:52,873
I wrote down the name
and address of the bank here.

292
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,874
What are you going to do?

293
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:02,353
I don't know. What can I do? I'll
go to the police, explain everything.

294
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,720
- Do you want me to take you?
- What do you mean?

295
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,389
- Want me to drive you?
- What does that mean?

296
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,597
- The police doesn't believe you?
- Not yet.

297
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:17,360
They're never going to believe you.
They won't look for Morgan, he's dead.

298
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:22,599
They think you've killed your partner.
Don't you understand?

299
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,679
You'll just sit there and wait
for the police to find something.

300
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:33,789
It'll cost you a million a week,
for how long? One week? Two, three?

301
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,556
- You hit a police officer.
- I get it. What can I do?

302
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,077
- Let me take care of it.
- What would you do?

303
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:48,030
- Do you have any leads?
- I don't even know what's happening.

304
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:53,194
- Has anyone acted suspiciously?
- Yes.

305
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,796
We have a deal
with some people from Belarus.

306
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,795
It went south. I don't know what
happened, but someone was behind it.

307
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:08,229
They're still in town, staying
at a place called Scandic Park Hotel.

308
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,790
Are you going to keep those?

309
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:24,037
- Do you have somewhere to sleep?
- Yes.

310
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,796
- I don't mean your summer house.
- I have another place.

311
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,036
Take it easy and relax.

312
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,955
- I'll call you. Tomorrow.
- Okay.

313
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,670
Danes.

314
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:22,868
I know a Swede who's worked
with those Danes before.

315
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,431
He's working with them now.
He's by the side of the house.

316
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,755
Okay.

317
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,713
He owes me. I saved his life in prison.

318
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:54,919
I need to ask you a favor
and you're not going to like it.

319
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,271
There's a clause in the contract
that says,

320
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,719
that if one of the partner dies,
the investors can withdraw their funds.

321
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:11,238
- Our law firm has backed out.
- They had good reason to.

322
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:16,758
- We need someone for legal advice.
- I don't think anyone would do it.

323
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,076
There is one person.

324
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,556
No.

325
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,991
If you had watched
your own father be that degraded...

326
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,357
...that humiliated...
Gabriel took everything.

327
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,432
I know, I know.

328
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,836
We don't want anything
to do with him.

329
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,597
Gabriel Mörk wanted to buy our share
in Cataegis. We're going to let him.

330
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,117
He'll help us, buy our share.
We'll have no further dealings.

331
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:00,318
Do you have the slightest idea
what you're asking of me?

332
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,119
I think I do.

333
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,149
I wouldn't ask if you weren't
the only person I could trust.

334
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:26,109
- When do you want me to talk to him?
- Now. Today, if possible.

335
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,919
- Okay.
- Thanks.

336
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,352
Thanks. I won't forget this.

337
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,909
I checked out that redirect.

338
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,436
The law firm had a temp
from a temp agency that day.

339
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:50,151
A man named Ahmed Aalam paid her
to redirect you to the wrong person.

340
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:53,710
Do you want me to check him out?

341
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:33,873
The technicians haven't found any tapes
for the camera. Have you seen any?

342
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,119
Do you know a man
named Morgan Nordenstråle?

343
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:50,753
His family owned Nova Investment
before Wilhelm and Thomas bought it.

344
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:54,799
And they bought all his shares?

345
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:00,671
It was at the same time
as that Caesar Batanga affair.

346
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:22,631
What the hell is going on here? What
are you doing? Why haven't you called?

347
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,510
Don't you realize how worried I am?
Why don't you turn yourself in?

348
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,434
And where did the money
in the safety deposit box come from?

349
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:36,958
Can't you just answer me?!. They said
you'd spent time in jail. Have you?

350
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:41,399
- Do you want me to answer all that?
- That's why I'm standing here.

351
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:46,076
Where should I start? I've never
been in prison. Who said that?

352
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:51,155
- I was in a juvenile facility a month.
- Was that where you met? Who is he?

353
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:56,348
- You bring these people into our home...
- He's my cousin Preben.

354
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:06,274
Why haven't you told me
you have a cousin?

355
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,949
I read that your father wasn't dead.

356
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:24,351
What is up with that? You told me he's
dead, that he died when you were young.

357
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:29,514
You've said a lot of things
and apparently none of it is true.

358
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:36,109
You have a great father.
I have a father I'd rather see dead.

359
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,636
That's the big difference.

360
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,110
Why haven't you told me this?

361
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,599
Because it's hard.

362
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,634
But it's me, Thomas.

363
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,155
It's me.

364
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,555
I'm sorry.

365
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:23,192
I'm talking to a man who knows where
Morgan is. Then I'm going to the police.

366
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:35,152
- Really?
- I promise.

367
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:08,711
Do you know of a man in Stockholm
named Ahmed Aalam?

368
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,395
No. How come?

369
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:17,475
- I think he knows where Morgan is.
- Okay.

370
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,036
And you're going to turn
Morgan over to the police?

371
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:26,955
- Yes, of course. Why?
- He's already dead.

372
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:33,039
You don't have to do it yourself.

373
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,470
Did you talk to the Russians?

374
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,671
They'd already checked out.

375
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:48,153
I'm trying to find out where they live.
I'll check out Ahmed later.

376
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:52,757
- I'll call you. Okay?
- Yeah.

377
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,630
What are you doing?

378
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,112
I thought I'd carry her
to her bedroom.

379
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:40,628
The police have launched an investigation
of Rahmberg and Skepphult.

380
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:47,751
It goes back to when they bought Nova
from the Nordenstråle family.

381
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:53,790
- You have one new message.
- I checked out Ahmed Aalam.

382
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:59,956
He owns a restaurant in Sollentuna
called "Aptitkungen". Call me.

383
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:32,830
- I need to speak to Ahmed.
- He's back there.

384
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,070
Thanks.

385
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,879
Hello?

386
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:53,636
- Who are you?
- Are you Ahmed Aalam?

387
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,678
What do you want?

388
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,513
I have a business proposition for you.

389
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:08,879
If we can come to an agreement,
this is yours. And a lot more.

390
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:17,394
- What's the proposition?
- How much did Morgan offer you?

391
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,678
He hasn't paid you yet, right?

392
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:25,196
He was never reliable
when it came to business.

393
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:29,239
- A bit too temperamental.
- What do you want with Morgan?

394
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:35,919
That's 50000. You'll get 450000
if you tell me where Morgan is.

395
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:40,277
Do you have the money?

396
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:43,637
- Do we have an agreement?
- When do I get it?

397
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:48,920
- When you show me where Morgan is.
- Okay.

398
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,919
Get in here.

399
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:03,512
- How much money did you say?
- That, plus 450000.

400
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:08,913
- But you want me to sell out Morgan?
- At least I'll pay you.

401
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,958
You're right about that.

402
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:19,798
He's a bit temperamental, and not
reliable when it comes to business.

403
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:23,748
- 450000.
- That's right.

404
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,799
You know,
Morgan will butcher me if he finds out.

405
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:33,191
450000...

406
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:38,628
450000 bucks.

407
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,668
450000 smackaroos.

408
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:51,830
- How much do you want?
- How much do you think my life's worth?

409
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,275
One million.

410
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:59,796
One million...
What would I do with one million?

411
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:05,353
- Open up a kebab stand in Baghdad?
- Two. Do you want two?

412
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:09,115
What good does money do me
if I'm dead?

413
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:14,552
Do you want to
do business or not?

414
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,553
"Do business..."

415
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:28,593
Weren't we supposed to leave
this morning?

416
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,232
I can't take staying here
much longer.

417
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,878
I'm worried about you.

418
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,273
And me too.

419
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,432
We can't leave
if we don't have money.

420
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,751
The police came to Strandvägen.

421
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,549
They asked about you.

422
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:02,393
I'm dead, Louise.

423
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:05,757
They're looking for
a video tape.

424
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,319
What tape?

425
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:14,838
They found your old video camera,
but it looked out of place.

426
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:23,637
I want you to find
that video tape.

427
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,914
How come?

428
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,158
Because it's mine.

429
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,117
What's on the video tape?

430
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,510
It's...

431
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,677
...my life...

432
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:49,799
...my soul, my name...

433
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,074
...my failure.

434
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,156
So... Is everything okay?

435
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:07,275
1500 kg of pressure.

436
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,269
Oops.

437
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,228
How much do you want?

438
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:27,349
You think people would do anything
for money. But you're wrong.

439
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:32,036
Money is nothing
when you're hurting really really badly.

440
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:47,632
You have to find the spot
that hurts the most.

441
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:54,194
You wouldn't have come to me
unless you had 450000 in cash.

442
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:57,238
I want that money.

443
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:06,992
It's on a boat in Nacka Strand.

444
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:13,712
It's called Glory Days and in
the bathroom there's a first aid kit.

445
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,680
Come with me.

446
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:50,596
- What are you doing here?
- I'm going to the bathroom.

447
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:06,357
- Yes?
- There's someone in the house.

448
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:09,910
One of your men is working for Morgan.
Check on Ebba.

449
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:15,712
Shut up! Do what I'm telling you, check
on Ebba. I saw pictures of her sleeping.

450
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,836
I'll call you back.

451
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,199
What is it?

452
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:32,238
- Nothing.
- Did something happen?

453
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:37,149
Stay here.

454
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:06,196
Okay, what's happening?
How is Ebba?

455
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:09,955
- She's fine. You saw pictures?
- Yes.

456
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:14,272
Someone had filmed her with
a cell phone while she was sleeping.

457
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:18,558
- I'll find out who it is.
- Shut up. What am I paying you for?

458
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,314
Take it easy.
I'm going to find out.

459
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:26,554
Morgan... He lives in Belarus
and has connections with the mob.

460
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,392
Okay.

461
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:33,190
I want to know everything about him.
Do you understand? Everything.

462
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:41,313
Gather up the Swedes
in the living room immediately.

463
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:59,959
- Yes?
- Who are you calling?

464
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,033
Who are you calling?

465
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:11,119
Lock yourselves in the bathroom
right away.

466
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,198
The girl is in the bedroom.
Get going.

467
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:36,989
- Where are they?
- In the bathroom.

468
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:40,554
The shareholders can't sell
their Nova Investment stock.

469
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:45,396
- I can't stop them.
- Your lawyers can.

470
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:52,396
That's the only condition we place
on your Cataegis acquisition.

471
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:58,316
I never thought I'd do business
with a von Klercking again.

472
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:06,798
The deal is only valid
until Thomas is proved innocent.

473
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,474
- If he is.
- He is.

474
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:16,115
So you trust him? And you expect me
to take a von Klercking's judgment,

475
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:21,274
as my only guarantee
that Skepphult is innocent?

476
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:26,275
I stand to lose a lot
if you’re wrong.

477
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:30,319
If I'm right you will make
a lot of money.

478
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,711
My reputation is
at stake here.

479
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:35,950
Reputation?

480
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:45,712
If you’ve got nothing else I'm afraid
I have to turn down your offer.

481
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:54,874
I helped your father when he was as
low as he could get, but he betrayed me.

482
01:03:55,040 --> 01:04:00,637
But you wouldn't betray someone.
I like that.

483
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:07,120
What I'm asking is, why are you making
such an effort for Thomas's sake?

484
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:10,750
- That's my business.
- You're wasting your talent.

485
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:15,311
No one will ever work
with Thomas again.

486
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:19,359
You're wrong.
I will work with him.

487
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:25,799
What would you say
if I offered you a very good job?

488
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:30,112
I think you can find the door
on your own.

489
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:35,516
I'll tell my lawyers
to get started tomorrow morning.

490
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:03,919
The lab technicians found this
on one of the bodies outside.

491
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:09,438
- Morgan Nordenstråle.
- It would seem like it.

492
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:21,875
Hi, Anna, it's me.
Call me at this number, it's new.

493
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:25,874
As soon as possible.
Bye, honey.

494
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,073
- Damn, you scared me.
- Where have you been?

495
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:07,239
- What are you doing here?
- Where have you been?

496
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:10,915
- I had to run an errand.
- What kind of errand?

497
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:14,793
Is everything alright?

498
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:21,877
They knew we had someone on the
inside. The wife and daughter got away.

499
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:26,477
How the hell
did that happen?!

500
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,795
No clue.

501
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:48,796
What's in the bag?

502
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:55,033
- Just some stuff.
- Show me.

503
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,949
Show me what's in the bag.

504
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:04,311
Show me what's in the bag!

505
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:15,319
I have Thomas in the basement.
Let me make a call.

506
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:20,474
I'll make him tell you
what you want to know. Okay?

507
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:31,150
- Use the speaker phone.
- Okay.

508
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,319
- Anna?
- Zero?

509
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:47,031
Looking for Zero, are you?
You big fat pig.

510
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:14,478
How are you, sweetheart?

511
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:19,191
- And what about Ebba?
- She's sleeping.

512
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:23,114
You have to get out of here,
understand?

513
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:26,272
I've spoken to my friends
in Marbella.

514
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:32,549
You can stay with them until this is over.
The plane leaves tomorrow.

515
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:37,475
- I just have to talk to Thomas first.
- I know what happened at your house.

516
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:41,838
The police found men dead there.
You have to think about Ebba.

517
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,834
- Forget Thomas.
- I have to talk to him, dad.

518
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,879
- You're blind. You don't know him.
- Oh, but you do?

519
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:53,589
My opinion of Thomas
doesn't matter any longer.

520
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:58,629
That Morgan character is apparently
still alive and he's a maniac.

521
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:02,076
You must realize
that Thomas did something.

522
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:07,838
It's time for you to decide
who really matters to you.

523
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:12,397
Oh god...

524
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:16,394
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry...

525
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:25,916
This is Fabian von Klercking, I can't...

526
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:30,358
This is a court order.
I'm here to search the premises.

527
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:36,755
- I'm the person in charge. Can I help?
- That all depends.

528
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:41,789
Can you tell us Caesar Batanga's
position in Cataegis-

529
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:46,033
- before Nova Investment bought
the company. Do you know of him?

530
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:52,799
Not really. I only know that he
killed himself...a very long time ago.

531
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:56,032
We've cleared out the staff.
- You have to leave.

532
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:06,318
It's just me.
Can you call me right away? Thanks.

533
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:11,554
- Okay, how did it go?
- Well, I just need some signatures.

534
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:15,629
Thank you.

535
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:32,078
- How are you?
- So-so.

536
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:39,195
- Preben has found Morgan.
- What?

537
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:44,388
Preben has found Morgan.
It looks like he was living in Belarus.

538
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:49,512
- So just go to the police.
- I'm going to.

539
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:53,195
I just have to find Anna first.

540
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:56,033
She's not answering.

541
01:10:56,200 --> 01:11:00,910
The police came by the office.
Officer Malm.

542
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:04,550
They were asking
about Caesar Batanga.

543
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:10,670
And then they searched our old files
and documents.

544
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:14,515
Do you know
what they were looking for?

545
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,157
Yes.

546
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:21,313
Something I'd forgot about.

547
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:29,678
Here. Can I borrow a jacket?

548
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:32,035
Sure.

549
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:21,558
What's on that tape, anyway?

550
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:28,159
- Damn, you scared me, Louise.
- Everyone is anxious to find it.

551
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:34,759
- Are you going somewhere?
- Can you play the tape?

552
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:38,276
- You don't want to see it.
- Please play the tape.

553
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:40,908
If I play it...

554
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:51,190
- You and Morgan.
- I want to see it.

555
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:05,352
Caesar Batanga.

556
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:15,913
That's Morgan.

557
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:22,599
- Turn it off.
- He's sick, Louise. Just look at him.

558
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:29,950
- Turn it off, I said.
- Look at him!

559
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:34,875
He filmed himself, he's a psychopath.
Look at him!

560
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:39,511
- I told you to turn it off!
- I'm sorry.

561
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:51,392
Louise, I need the tape, it's the only
thing that can clear me. Understand?

562
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,793
Louise...

563
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:58,872
I need the tape, Louise.

564
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:07,032
Did you know that Morgan
has threatened to kill my family?

565
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:13,312
Anna and Ebba.

566
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:21,148
He's married
and has children in Belarus.

567
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:24,630
I'm sorry, but it's true.

568
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:28,475
You're not a part of his future plans.

569
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:32,679
You're just a tool, just like I am.

570
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:38,318
And when he's done with me,
you're next.

571
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:43,395
I'm sorry, Louise.

572
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:48,792
Help me. Please, help me.
Give me the tape.

573
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:56,799
My husband had a bank account
with 100 million,

574
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,918
but I can't get to it.

575
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:04,596
I can't imagine you not having
an offshore account.

576
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:11,119
- Give me the money.
- If you give me the tape...

577
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:20,475
Don't you think the officers downstairs
heard the shots?

578
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:33,349
Give me the money.

579
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:45,433
- What's going on?
- He ran that way, towards the kitchen.

580
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:29,633
That took forever.

581
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:42,634
Anna.

582
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:46,076
- Anna?
- Where are you?

583
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:50,552
- I'm with Fabian. Where are you?
- The country house.

584
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:55,589
Dad arranged for us to stay in Spain,
I'm going there tomorrow with Ebba.

585
01:17:55,760 --> 01:18:00,834
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

586
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,515
What are you doing?

587
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,752
I'm just trying to solve this.

588
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:15,199
- Did you deceive Morgan?
- What did you say?

589
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:18,955
Did you deceive Morgan?

590
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:24,752
- What are you asking?
- I thought that Morgan was dead.

591
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:28,439
- Me too. What are you asking?
- Why did he show up now?

592
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:32,956
I don't know. What do you
want me to say? I don't know.

593
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:36,510
I'm not the psychopath here.

594
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:39,831
- Preben was shot.
- What?

595
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:48,591
I think that Preben is dead. I'm sorry.
So much has happened.

596
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:53,151
- We haven't had time to talk...
- Where are you?

597
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:55,914
- The country house.
- Is Ebba there?

598
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:59,914
No, she's with dad,
she's sleeping there.

599
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:03,959
You're not alone there, are you?

600
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:11,000
Anna? Anna!

601
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:16,476
Anna?

602
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:20,349
Bring the access codes
to Härtuna.

603
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:59,914
Did you bring the toiletry bag?

604
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:02,719
- Yes.
- Take it out.

605
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:06,668
- It's in the back.
- Open it.

606
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:09,832
- What?
- Open it.

607
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,230
Listen to me...

608
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,870
Louise has a video tape.
I need you to get it.

609
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,560
Louise?

610
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:26,793
She was involved
with Wilhelm's murder.

611
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:31,192
What am I supposed to do?

612
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:37,268
Just get the tape.

613
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:46,151
I can't do it, Thomas.
There has to be some other way.

614
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,880
I need this tape.

615
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:55,110
- I can't do anything illegal.
- Get the fucking tape!

616
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:57,589
Get it!

617
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:03,556
Come on, I'm in a hurry.
Come on!

618
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:43,513
Where is the tape?

619
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:49,790
Give me the tape!

620
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:07,912
Where is it, Louise?

621
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:37,316
I need a car at 25 Strandvägen.
A woman has cut open her arms.

622
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:40,517
She's bleeding all over the place.

623
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:43,510
Yes.

624
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:46,274
Hold on. Just let me...

625
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:52,833
No, it's both arms.

626
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:19,871
What the...?

627
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:22,069
Anna, stay calm.
I'm here now.

628
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:25,753
Take it easy.

629
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:30,749
Take it easy, I'm getting you down.

630
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:16,874
It's time, Thomas.
Time to settle old debts. Okay?

631
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:22,675
Your account number.

632
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:25,673
Let Anna go first.

633
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:30,277
- You have no say here!
- Wait.

634
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:33,079
Okay.

635
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:37,711
35-26-03-10...

636
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:40,633
...30-45.

637
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:44,429
Access code?

638
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:48,229
26-24-58-26...

639
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:52,790
...39-65.

640
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:59,519
- Last one?
- Let Anna go first.

641
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:04,470
Just choose -
your wife or the money?

642
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:09,839
- You'll kill us both when you have it.
- I'll let her go.

643
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:16,957
You're still the same. You love money
more than you love your wife. Bastard!

644
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:20,715
- I don't trust you. What's my guarantee?
- Here it is.

645
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:26,871
25-11-25-86...

646
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:29,270
...11-25-86...

647
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:32,238
...11-45.

648
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:42,475
Morgan.

649
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:46,718
Morgan?

650
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:49,633
Listen to me, Morgan.

651
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:55,790
Morgan.

652
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:57,791
No!

653
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:03,314
Anna!

654
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:09,675
Come on, Anna.

655
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:17,193
Come on, Anna!

656
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:27,798
Did you actually think
that you could beat me?

657
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:45,235
You damn...

658
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:56,879
I'm sorry.

659
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:47,913
I brought your clothes
and these.

660
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:54,189
Who's the reflection of?

661
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:59,358
Who is that?

662
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:26,236
Have you made any copies?

663
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:32,111
No.

664
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:35,636
- Are you sure?
- I wouldn't dare.

665
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:39,190
No one scares me
as much as you.

666
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:15,559
There was never a crisis. The finances
are solid, the owners are pleased.

667
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:20,714
Wilhelm's wife Louise has admitted
complicity in her husband's murder.

668
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:25,954
This clears my client
of all these terrible charges...

669
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:32,077
I've wondered if Wilhelm
saw the whole tape.

670
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:35,437
If it was his ace in the hole.

671
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:46,154
One thing is certain,
he knew my weak spot.

672
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:51,348
But that's the point of weak spots.
Everyone's got one.

673
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:55,035
All you have to do is find it.
