It's objective is essentially pedagogic.
The young students. More than looking for

3
00:00:29,773 --> 00:00:34,773
a job hope, they go thru the main
door to arrive to the magical and

4
00:00:34,774 --> 00:00:37,274
wonderful movie making world.

5
00:01:07,955 --> 00:01:09,582
The subway is without a doubt,

6
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:13,485
a symbol of these times.

7
00:01:13,676 --> 00:01:17,008
A labyrinth where in
silence we cross each other,

8
00:01:18,831 --> 00:01:20,667
without knowing who
nor where they're going.

9
00:01:20,668 --> 00:01:22,446
Hundreds of routes,

10
00:01:23,063 --> 00:01:26,898
on which we take advantage to establish
a balance, to re-look a situation,

11
00:01:27,542 --> 00:01:31,142
and try to ride more than a train,

12
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,958
a change of life...

13
00:01:35,538 --> 00:01:37,147
It's a strange game,

14
00:01:37,148 --> 00:01:38,148
on which we submerge
ourselves in infinite tunnels

15
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:42,149
without realizing that in each transfer

16
00:01:44,054 --> 00:01:47,105
we're definitively changing our destiny

17
00:01:49,396 --> 00:01:52,206
With the subway I found the
most powerful machine to look,

18
00:01:53,642 --> 00:01:58,259
but I've never imagined what will
happen to me in the near future.

Attention garage! This is Bolivar!

Copy me, garage!

25
00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:35,766
Can someone answer me?!

26
00:04:38,455 --> 00:04:39,603
This is garage, Bolivar, I copy you.

27
00:04:40,495 --> 00:04:44,818
I received a call from "Plaza Italia", we're
late and with overflow. Send another "comboy"!

28
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,205
You copied that?

29
00:04:47,206 --> 00:04:49,013
I've sent everything, Bolivar.

30
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:52,564
What do you mean everything?

31
00:04:54,393 --> 00:04:57,100
I sent the last car a while
ago, I have nothing here... huh.

32
00:04:57,246 --> 00:05:00,246
What?! That can't be. You
should have more trains!

33
00:05:00,247 --> 00:05:02,562
You should have at least one more.

34
00:05:02,563 --> 00:05:06,063
- I have nothing!
- Well, okay. I'll see where I can find another one.

35
00:05:06,664 --> 00:05:11,876
But you check your list. You may be having one
more in your sector, and you haven't noticed.

36
00:05:11,877 --> 00:05:13,676
Understood?

37
00:05:13,677 --> 00:05:16,643
Listen Bolivar, I repeat, I
have nothing to check in here.

38
00:05:17,563 --> 00:05:24,550
Why are you telling me that? Do you know you're
talking to your boss, dammit!? Understood!

00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:25,839
Yes, this is Juan Vega.

41
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:29,200
I don't understand.

42
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:32,172
What did you lost?

43
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,501
- Now what?
- And we keep on going straight?

44
00:07:38,502 --> 00:07:41,229
Straight to the right,
or straight to the left

45
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:45,999
If you don't pay attention,
we'll stay here all night.

46
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,901
- Which way should I take, boss?
- Well... can't you see we can't move?

47
00:07:49,996 --> 00:07:52,280
Well, if it's because of the
lights, we ain't going no where

48
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:54,447
Besides, there are a lot out of order

49
00:07:54,448 --> 00:07:56,948
What you talking about?

50
00:08:35,096 --> 00:08:37,720
Hello? Please put me through the CEO

51
00:09:31,852 --> 00:09:33,040
Sir?

52
00:09:34,626 --> 00:09:38,290
Vega, I hope you have a good
reason to made me come down here.

53
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,701
I was expecting you.

54
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,152
You can't imagine how
well I feel here, Pratt.

55
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,139
Taking some fresh air.

56
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:24,019
I can't stand the closed
feeling of the office

57
00:10:24,977 --> 00:10:29,718
I feel like taking one of these routes and never
coming back to this city, that why I make them

58
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,844
If I ask to any of the architects
this, they'll think I just gave up.

59
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:38,345
And I...

60
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:43,488
I don't want to go back top the subway
thing just because some nut got the idea.

61
00:10:43,489 --> 00:10:45,070
This work for me is done.

62
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,950
Yes but I, I don't know how can I help
you. I didn't participate in this project,

63
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:51,451
and I'm not even an architect.

64
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,728
I don't need an architect.

65
00:10:54,729 --> 00:10:57,061
Besides, no one wants to go
back down there, it's very hot.

66
00:10:59,027 --> 00:11:03,648
I called you 'cause I know you like problems. In
fact, you dedicated yourself to math, isn't it?

67
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:10,357
- Topology
- Ah! The fascination for the analysis of surfaces,

68
00:11:10,689 --> 00:11:14,248
one formula, one calculation
and you keep it in a book.

69
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:22,000
It seems to weird to me... Like those expositions
that CEO of the subway does... that Blazi.

70
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,520
Go and see what is happening to
him. That way I can be more calmed.

71
00:11:28,491 --> 00:11:30,880
Maybe you'll find that
crazy nut interesting.

72
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:36,935
Although I doubt it, Anyways, I don't want to
tire you more. When we finished the perimetral

73
00:11:36,936 --> 00:11:41,152
construction, everything was okay
and we were done. Now they have flaws.

74
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:49,537
One more thing, just in case... The original
planes are in the public works archive.

75
00:11:50,378 --> 00:11:52,932
Ours are an identical copy
from those approved a year ago.

76
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:56,471
But that's just a detail, actually
I don't know what they want.

77
00:11:58,109 --> 00:12:00,234
But if it's Blazi, it can
be just about anything.

78
00:12:01,008 --> 00:12:04,431
Anyways, please don't
look for me for nothing

79
00:12:06,991 --> 00:12:09,702
- What's that for?
- I don't know

80
00:12:11,153 --> 00:12:13,703
They told me it
potentials the perception.

81
00:12:17,018 --> 00:12:18,100
Resolve it.

82
00:12:19,028 --> 00:12:24,207
Oh! And tell Blazi I went
far, far away, by the highway.

83
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,502
I assure you we're doing what we can.

84
00:12:58,515 --> 00:13:03,855
But you can imagine that I cannot look
thru all the network for just a supposition.

85
00:13:07,058 --> 00:13:10,413
Well, you know how the kids
are, they just love the subway.

86
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:18,704
Ma'am, 5 million people
pass by here everyday.

87
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:27,290
I'm sorry, it's your responsibility. If you
don't know where he is, it's your problem.

88
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,875
- Mr. Blazi, someone of the construction arrived
- Let him in...

89
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:42,200
Yes ma'am, I understand,
huh... excuse me ma'am...

90
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:47,855
You know... I have things to do, ma'am.

91
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,977
Come in!

92
00:13:52,992 --> 00:13:54,390
- Sir...
- Daniel Brat.

93
00:13:55,885 --> 00:13:59,798
Excuse my amazement, but I was
expecting my old friend Beker.

94
00:13:59,928 --> 00:14:03,709
He might arrive later,
'cause I told him I needed him

95
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:07,439
No, you see, Mr. Beker had to leave town
in a hurry, and asked me to replace him.

96
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,340
He might be nuts, as if
this is just bullshit...

97
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:15,000
I asked him not lo
leave me alone in this

98
00:14:15,057 --> 00:14:18,500
He gave me all the instructions, so
I can resolve anything you might need.

99
00:14:18,505 --> 00:14:21,322
How would you help me if you don't have
the slightest idea of what's this all about?

100
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:24,363
He should have called

101
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,370
Beker, thinks these are beginners stuff

102
00:14:31,141 --> 00:14:34,013
I'm topologist, a mathematician.

103
00:14:34,314 --> 00:14:35,557
What is that good for?

104
00:14:36,077 --> 00:14:42,865
It's a branch of mathematics which studies
surfaces and converts them into formulas.

105
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:51,076
So useful for my nerves. This is it!
...look go to the office and tell...

106
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:53,300
Mr. Blazi

107
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:56,513
What's going on today that
nobody asks permission?!

108
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,000
It's happening again...

109
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Come.

110
00:15:26,188 --> 00:15:28,688
I need you to pay attention.

111
00:15:28,689 --> 00:15:32,369
I want you to look everything that's going
on, so you can tell Beker this isn't bullshit.

112
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:35,870
If I called him is not because I'm
hysteric, but I have a reason to call him.

113
00:15:35,871 --> 00:15:44,099
Of course, I'm going to ask you have caution
and discretion with everything you hear or see.

114
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,600
Don't go around telling
anyone, you know how this is...

115
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:53,312
Then, anything can be published at the
newspaper and find myself implicated in nothing.

116
00:15:53,313 --> 00:15:55,926
Imagine that, a man like me
cannot neglect those details.

117
00:15:55,927 --> 00:16:00,706
What? That one doesn't
work either? Fix it at once.

118
00:16:00,707 --> 00:16:05,164
Millions of people are being transported in
these tunnels daily, you cannot control everyone.

119
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:09,700
Look, if someone plants a bomb.
What face do you want us to put, huh?

120
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:12,666
Everything that happens here
inside is my responsibility.

121
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:20,369
Imagine that being the CEO of this place
isn't easy. This is a very difficult situation.

122
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:24,756
Sir, we have train 101 coming from
Ezeiza, stopped at the access tunnel.

123
00:16:25,793 --> 00:16:29,212
I already gave it the passing order. It's
blocking two levels and they refuse to go on.

124
00:16:36,748 --> 00:16:39,400
Communication open to 101.

125
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:43,912
Intern 101, this is the CEO.

126
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:45,230
What's going on that
you refuse to advance?

127
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:48,159
From red it went to green and from green
it went to red, I cannot take that risk,

128
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,260
How do I know there's no other
train coming from the other side?

129
00:16:50,261 --> 00:16:51,778
The pass is blocked.

130
00:16:52,749 --> 00:16:55,555
That's a negative,
101. The pass is free.

131
00:16:56,008 --> 00:16:58,799
Yes, no sir, but you know
it's forbidden. If we crash...

132
00:16:59,098 --> 00:17:02,874
Advance 101, I repeat, the pass is free

133
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:06,769
- But listen to me, I don't...
- Keep on going, I order you!

134
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,395
- I can't...
- Move!

135
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:17,179
If this keeps on like that, we will be forced
to stop that line and cross all the sector...

136
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:20,159
I don't think that would be convenient.

137
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,061
Since the perimetral system was
opened, it became too complex to close.

138
00:17:38,175 --> 00:17:45,526
<i>Driver Rodriguez, Driver Rodriguez,
you are required at the signals cabin</i>

139
00:17:51,589 --> 00:17:55,360
<i>Subway informs you: the
temperature outside in our city</i>

140
00:17:55,361 --> 00:18:00,264
<i>is 38.7º C, humidity at 90%</i>

141
00:18:01,174 --> 00:18:03,884
What's going on with you? I tell
you to move and you refuse to?

142
00:18:03,885 --> 00:18:06,585
But the light changed constantly,
what did you want me to do?

143
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,370
if the 86 is coming at
the cross, we might crash

144
00:18:09,371 --> 00:18:12,816
Lower your voice tone, I'm the CEO

145
00:18:12,817 --> 00:18:15,377
If I say you to move, you must move.

146
00:18:15,378 --> 00:18:17,936
But there's a regulation we must follow
Sir, if the light is red we cannot mo..

147
00:18:17,937 --> 00:18:20,497
Forget about the Regulation! The
only one that knows what has to

148
00:18:20,498 --> 00:18:23,279
be done here is me.
And you must obey me!

149
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,830
But that can't be sir, those
are directives of the company

150
00:18:25,831 --> 00:18:28,380
life of the people is in
danger, it's impossible.

151
00:18:28,381 --> 00:18:31,102
I repeat, the only one that knows
what has to be done here is me.

152
00:18:32,165 --> 00:18:34,636
Oh really?

153
00:18:34,637 --> 00:18:36,000
You drive then, Sir.

154
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:44,950
Come.

155
00:18:53,095 --> 00:18:56,520
You still think I'm lying,

156
00:18:56,521 --> 00:18:59,021
I guess you already noticed
how bad this problem is.

157
00:19:06,115 --> 00:19:11,608
Lights detect the pass of the trains, where
there are any, in other words, they're failing

158
00:19:12,256 --> 00:19:16,709
There are routes changes
when we don't make one.

159
00:19:18,847 --> 00:19:21,950
And there's a complete
train we can't find.

160
00:19:24,091 --> 00:19:29,280
There are so many tunnels, that we don't
have enough personnel to search for it.

161
00:19:30,611 --> 00:19:36,186
At midnight, some authorities
will come to the Park Station.

162
00:19:36,187 --> 00:19:40,243
To do the same movements in the
place that train was last seen.

163
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,453
And I'm supposed to give them
an explanation of what happened.

164
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:53,302
Funny thing is that I have no explanation
'cause I don't know what's going on.

165
00:19:55,751 --> 00:19:58,228
...and I'm the CEO.

166
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:04,434
Listen, I need all the planes
approved by the ministry.

167
00:20:05,464 --> 00:20:08,520
Just in case they ask
something, you see?

168
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:12,042
How do I explain the
disappearing of a complete train?

169
00:20:15,362 --> 00:20:17,726
I trust you'll come with the planes.

170
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,746
What was your name?

171
00:20:20,747 --> 00:20:25,142
- Daniel Prat.
- Okay, Mr. Prat, I'll be expecting you this evening.

172
00:20:27,087 --> 00:20:30,929
And if you come out with
an idea, please tell me.

173
00:20:37,588 --> 00:20:42,503
<i>Driver Figueroa, Driver Figueroa,
please go to the mantainment office.</i>

174
00:20:51,134 --> 00:20:53,280
<i>- Constructor
- Yes, I'd like to speak with Mr. Deker.</i>

175
00:20:53,281 --> 00:20:54,955
<i>I'm sorry, he's not available.</i>

176
00:20:54,956 --> 00:20:56,626
<i>- Who is it?
- Daniel Prad</i>

177
00:20:56,627 --> 00:20:58,439
<i>Would you like to leave a message?</i>

178
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,146
Tell him to call the ministry

179
00:21:01,147 --> 00:21:04,116
And authorize me to make
copies of the perimetral planes.

180
00:21:26,101 --> 00:21:27,656
<i>No one told me you'd be here.</i>

181
00:21:27,657 --> 00:21:33,669
<i>27, 28, 29, 30...</i>

182
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:37,689
<i>I've been ordering these
archives for 40 years.</i>

183
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,574
<i>Are you sure they are over here?</i>

184
00:21:39,575 --> 00:21:43,057
<i>Of course, the question is where!</i>

185
00:21:44,148 --> 00:21:47,470
Just about now, they think
of changing of building.

186
00:21:47,471 --> 00:21:49,569
They may have done it on purpose.

187
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:52,525
Excuse me, which
requirement did you told me?

188
00:21:52,526 --> 00:21:54,202
The last one, the one
about the perimetral

189
00:21:54,203 --> 00:21:57,614
Let's see, let me think.

190
00:21:57,615 --> 00:21:59,832
I think we're doing fine.

191
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:06,668
31, 32, 33, 34...

192
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:10,197
There have been other movements,

193
00:22:10,198 --> 00:22:12,725
but inside the building.

194
00:22:12,726 --> 00:22:18,271
Other floors, years
ago there was a flood

195
00:22:18,272 --> 00:22:21,129
that made all these archives

196
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:23,228
to float for days.

197
00:22:23,229 --> 00:22:28,834
It's in the upper shelf.

198
00:22:30,826 --> 00:22:31,600
Let me do it.

199
00:22:39,074 --> 00:22:40,043
There's nothing in here.

200
00:22:40,044 --> 00:22:42,469
- It can't be!
- There's nothing in here.

201
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:45,614
- It might be some other place
- Take a good look

202
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:48,127
- It's empty
- I'll be back

203
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:02,674
I think you're out of luck

204
00:23:02,675 --> 00:23:05,061
Those took'em

205
00:23:05,062 --> 00:23:07,310
But they can't

206
00:23:07,311 --> 00:23:10,686
- Original planes
- It depends who asks for them.

207
00:23:10,687 --> 00:23:14,853
As always, the person who took'em...

208
00:23:14,854 --> 00:23:17,628
was a project adviser

209
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:20,613
So, I couldn't say no to him

210
00:23:20,614 --> 00:23:24,650
You understood? I think
I remember the fella.

211
00:23:24,651 --> 00:23:29,217
He was a very quite
man, that sometime before

212
00:23:29,218 --> 00:23:33,556
He used to come and stayed
hours checking those planes

213
00:23:33,557 --> 00:23:37,064
Here he is, Hugo Mistein

214
00:23:38,403 --> 00:23:40,295
Do you have anything to do with him?

215
00:24:28,665 --> 00:24:30,503
<i>We must take on account
that they're analyzing</i>

216
00:24:30,504 --> 00:24:32,549
<i>The aspects of pure theory</i>

217
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,609
<i>Not applicable until the moment</i>

218
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,275
<i>Which means...</i>

219
00:24:36,276 --> 00:24:37,812
- Is this Topology 3 class?
- Yes

220
00:24:37,813 --> 00:24:41,702
The conclusion is that
2 topological spaces

221
00:24:41,703 --> 00:24:44,129
Or that they're not formally identical

222
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,740
Are the same that apply

223
00:24:45,741 --> 00:24:46,903
For all the ministries

224
00:24:48,335 --> 00:24:49,594
In other sciences branches.

225
00:24:49,595 --> 00:24:51,600
If for example an astronomer presents

226
00:24:51,601 --> 00:24:53,748
An acceptable theory about the universe

227
00:24:53,749 --> 00:24:55,153
For the normal street man

228
00:24:55,154 --> 00:24:57,087
Surely is wrong

229
00:24:58,473 --> 00:25:00,173
But if someone said, for example

230
00:25:00,174 --> 00:25:02,874
That in some regions, time paralyzes

231
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:07,076
He could have, at least, listened it

232
00:25:07,077 --> 00:25:09,395
You might be right

233
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,946
Sciences and philosophies still

234
00:25:12,947 --> 00:25:14,757
are a bit weir, gentleman.

235
00:25:14,758 --> 00:25:17,400
Thank you for your
attention Class dismissed.

236
00:25:30,916 --> 00:25:31,946
Can I ask you a question?

237
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,600
Are you a student?

238
00:25:33,601 --> 00:25:36,503
No, not anymore. I
graduated quite a while ago

239
00:25:36,504 --> 00:25:38,446
How may I help you?

240
00:25:38,447 --> 00:25:40,814
Well, I'm looking for a professor

241
00:25:40,815 --> 00:25:42,258
that was in charge of this class

242
00:25:42,259 --> 00:25:44,006
At least he was for many years

243
00:25:44,007 --> 00:25:45,400
Doctor Mistein

244
00:25:45,401 --> 00:25:48,695
You don't lose your time How
much time since you last saw hi?

245
00:25:48,696 --> 00:25:51,077
About 5 years...

246
00:25:51,078 --> 00:25:53,407
You must be from the latest generations

247
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,834
he had. Sometime later, he left

248
00:25:55,835 --> 00:25:57,573
- the university
- Why?

249
00:25:57,574 --> 00:25:59,735
He was distracted, lost interest

250
00:25:59,736 --> 00:26:02,634
During classes, he had
his mind in something else.

251
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:05,487
Do you know how to find him?

252
00:26:07,722 --> 00:26:09,453
Hum... Yes, possibly

253
00:26:09,454 --> 00:26:11,964
I have a phone number and an old address

254
00:26:11,965 --> 00:26:14,336
Where we used to call him

255
00:26:14,337 --> 00:26:17,871
He refused to talk to
us and we never knew why

256
00:26:19,047 --> 00:26:21,361
I don't know what happened to him

257
00:26:21,362 --> 00:26:23,851
The few ones we are
on this... here it is

258
00:26:23,852 --> 00:26:26,107
Appreciate him very much

259
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:36,341
Well, please excuse me,
it's getting late... Goodbye

260
00:26:41,788 --> 00:26:42,653
Thanks

261
00:26:56,038 --> 00:26:56,733
Downstairs

262
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,469
Do you know where can
I find a telephone?

263
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,152
- Downstairs
- Thanks

264
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:14,369
Underground

265
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,589
<i>Hello</i>

266
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:37,476
Hello, may I speak to professor Mistein?

267
00:27:37,477 --> 00:27:40,179
<i>- No
- But, is he there?</i>

268
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,696
<i>- No, he's not</i>

269
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,052
Can you tell me at
what time he'll be back?

270
00:27:46,053 --> 00:27:48,973
<i>- I don't know
- Do you know where he is?</i>

271
00:27:48,974 --> 00:27:51,109
<i>How should I know.</i>

272
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:54,174
<i>If you want to leave him a
message, I can do that for you.</i>

273
00:27:54,627 --> 00:27:58,164
Yes... Do you have
something to write to?

274
00:27:58,165 --> 00:27:59,616
<i>Yes, who are you?</i>

275
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:03,465
<i>- I'm Daniel Prad
- Prad?</i>

276
00:28:03,466 --> 00:28:05,220
From the studio of del Plata

277
00:28:05,221 --> 00:28:07,976
It's about a job he did for the subway

278
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,163
<i>Slowly</i>

279
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,168
We need some planes...

280
00:32:19,178 --> 00:32:20,045
You live here?

281
00:32:29,195 --> 00:32:31,203
I wanted to know if
professor Mistein is here.

282
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,075
He lives here, doesn't he?

283
00:32:39,847 --> 00:32:41,302
I called many times before coming, but

284
00:32:41,303 --> 00:32:44,562
It's not easy to reach
communication with this place.

285
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:47,387
I thought that maybe
the line was damaged

286
00:32:47,388 --> 00:32:49,872
And since I need to
talk with the professor

287
00:32:49,873 --> 00:32:52,981
- I decided to come.
- You called just once.

288
00:32:56,365 --> 00:32:57,541
And I said he wasn't here

289
00:32:59,671 --> 00:33:00,719
He came back

290
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,842
I came 'cause I need
some papers from the job

291
00:33:06,843 --> 00:33:08,561
He has them and I need them

292
00:33:12,752 --> 00:33:14,569
Look in the apartment if
he's there and if he's OK.

293
00:33:16,682 --> 00:33:18,053
And if your not lying.

294
00:33:22,604 --> 00:33:23,866
Since when you don't see him?

295
00:34:03,244 --> 00:34:05,628
If you steal anything... I scream

296
00:37:25,932 --> 00:37:26,475
Wait

297
00:37:49,673 --> 00:37:51,741
April, April? Are you there?

298
00:37:51,742 --> 00:37:55,527
Open the door... Who are you with?

299
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,887
<i>- Over here
- Stairs are dirty</i>

300
00:38:00,888 --> 00:38:02,100
<i>This is disgusting, you didn't</i>

301
00:38:02,101 --> 00:38:03,101
<i>do anything I asked you to, open</i>

302
00:38:04,899 --> 00:38:06,678
<i>open the door, you'll see</i>

303
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,217
<i>You should be alone</i>

304
00:38:16,218 --> 00:38:18,716
<i>Damn girl, I told you I don't want</i>

305
00:38:18,717 --> 00:38:20,944
<i>- Come on!
- April!</i>

306
00:38:20,945 --> 00:38:23,374
<i>April, open up</i>

307
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:25,808
<i>April</i>

308
00:38:54,262 --> 00:38:55,089
Come, come!

309
00:38:58,009 --> 00:38:58,626
Wait

310
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:12,139
You know how to go back
to your house from here?

311
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:15,318
'Cause I have a meeting right now

312
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:16,613
And people is waiting

313
00:39:16,614 --> 00:39:17,744
They won't like to see you.

314
00:39:18,725 --> 00:39:20,661
My mother wouldn't
like to see you either.

315
00:39:22,117 --> 00:39:23,274
But I let you in anyways.

316
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:26,735
Come

317
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,410
Excuse me, the CEO?

318
00:39:46,411 --> 00:39:49,527
- Down there, underground 2
- Thanks

319
00:40:26,414 --> 00:40:30,106
- Why are we here?
- We're looking for a ghost train

320
00:40:31,628 --> 00:40:32,389
Sit there

321
00:40:36,574 --> 00:40:38,083
You keep this, stay here and don't move.

322
00:40:38,271 --> 00:40:40,405
Yes? Is here?

323
00:40:53,431 --> 00:40:55,546
Excuse me, I'm looking for the CEO

324
00:40:55,547 --> 00:40:56,876
Is he over here?

325
00:40:56,877 --> 00:40:58,739
He's out of duty,

326
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,906
Who gave you authorization
to be down here?

327
00:41:29,093 --> 00:41:29,900
What are you doing here?

328
00:41:32,301 --> 00:41:34,743
- Mr. Blassi
- What took you so long, Prad?

329
00:41:34,744 --> 00:41:36,194
This girl is with you?

330
00:41:37,564 --> 00:41:38,973
I'm sorry I couldn't come before.

331
00:41:38,974 --> 00:41:40,742
It was impossible for me

332
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,246
But I think what's this all about

333
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,693
Are these the ministry's plan?

334
00:41:50,068 --> 00:41:50,792
What happened?

335
00:41:52,634 --> 00:41:53,904
I hope you know what you'll say

336
00:41:53,905 --> 00:41:55,930
The train is still gone

337
00:41:55,931 --> 00:41:58,261
And I don't want to have more
problems than I already do.

338
00:41:58,262 --> 00:42:00,480
Now come with me.

339
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:11,837
Here, I leave you this so you play
whilst I speak to these people.

340
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:12,742
Okay.

341
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,399
<i>Exactly, we checked everything and...
- Gentlemen</i>

342
00:42:27,428 --> 00:42:29,606
Mr. Daniel Prad.

343
00:42:29,607 --> 00:42:32,015
Representing studio Del Plata.

344
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:34,959
They built the perimetral connection

345
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:39,027
Mr. Kent, our Engineer Chief

346
00:42:40,172 --> 00:42:42,998
Mr. Aguirre, representing intendancy

347
00:42:42,999 --> 00:42:46,233
Dr. Canotti from the
central military hospital.

348
00:42:47,204 --> 00:42:50,824
Dr. Nazar from del Sur insurance co.

349
00:42:52,358 --> 00:42:55,858
And our driver... Edmundo

350
00:43:01,753 --> 00:43:03,278
Please try to specify.

351
00:43:03,279 --> 00:43:04,849
You saw it, or not?

352
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:08,606
Well yes, I mean...
we practically saw it

353
00:43:08,607 --> 00:43:10,869
When we found that red light

354
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:13,266
Just at the entrance
of the General Paz joint

355
00:43:13,267 --> 00:43:15,604
Couldn't that be another train?

356
00:43:15,605 --> 00:43:17,850
All trains have been
retired from the tracks.

357
00:43:17,851 --> 00:43:22,708
Except this one... We
are the only ones we've

358
00:43:22,709 --> 00:43:26,076
traveling thru the system
during the last four hours

359
00:43:27,848 --> 00:43:30,415
When Edmundo stopped in
front of the red light

360
00:43:30,416 --> 00:43:32,455
I thought it was out of order.

361
00:43:32,456 --> 00:43:35,091
That's why I told him to keep on going

362
00:43:37,442 --> 00:43:39,984
That's when we heard the noise

363
00:43:39,985 --> 00:43:41,821
the other train was doing
whilst crossing the joint.

364
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:47,471
- You saw it?
- No, no, we couldn't see it.

365
00:43:47,472 --> 00:43:49,671
The light is just before the curve

366
00:43:49,672 --> 00:43:52,104
But... we all heard it.

367
00:43:52,105 --> 00:43:53,911
Why didn't you followed it?

368
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:57,269
Well... we were not sure
about where it went to.

369
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:59,720
It was there, we cannot
be wrong about it.

370
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:01,938
That was at 1:38, wasn't it?

371
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:05,299
- Yes, the first time.
- The first.

372
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,477
Gentlemen, this chat is going nowhere.

373
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,998
So, later it happened again

374
00:44:10,999 --> 00:44:13,113
Yes, but not in the same place

375
00:44:13,114 --> 00:44:17,050
We found another red
signal near the joint

376
00:44:17,051 --> 00:44:18,369
Yesterday at 2:15

377
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:20,282
Then, again at 3:30

378
00:44:21,562 --> 00:44:22,983
You saw the train at 2:15?

379
00:44:22,984 --> 00:44:26,893
No, we didn't but we felt the vibration

380
00:44:26,894 --> 00:44:29,283
So, I tried to reach it, but...

381
00:44:29,284 --> 00:44:32,035
It must have turn somewhere
else at the General Paz joint

382
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:34,783
'Cause there's a
declivity beyond the light

383
00:45:23,486 --> 00:45:25,243
It's impossible that that train was

384
00:45:25,244 --> 00:45:27,485
circulating during all these days

385
00:45:27,486 --> 00:45:29,072
Without no one noticing

386
00:45:29,073 --> 00:45:30,959
What's impossible is that you

387
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,645
are surprised being the main responsible

388
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,521
- Now in the moment that...
- Wait a second, young man.

389
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:41,778
We aren't here to hear
questions, but to make'em

390
00:46:11,561 --> 00:46:13,058
This time we've got it.

391
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:25,694
It's passing by the inferior
level where Maloni is

392
00:46:39,318 --> 00:46:41,102
You saw it? It's passed near by.

393
00:46:41,103 --> 00:46:43,508
- It passed by the lower level
- Not, the higher one

394
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:46,672
- No! It passed by the lower level
- What is going on, Blassi?

395
00:46:48,224 --> 00:46:50,312
You saw it by yourself, it
passed down here, am I right?

396
00:46:50,313 --> 00:46:51,582
- Yes, yes, yes.

397
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:53,354
You really saw it?

398
00:46:53,355 --> 00:46:55,585
We heard it, it passed
by the upper level

399
00:46:55,586 --> 00:46:57,657
And I think in that direction.

400
00:46:57,658 --> 00:46:59,332
Maloni, go back downstairs.

401
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:02,530
Excuse me

402
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,352
Tell the authorities
I'll be right there.

403
00:47:09,716 --> 00:47:12,005
Engineer, Is there
any way to communicate

404
00:47:12,006 --> 00:47:17,158
- to the Main office?
- Yes, yes, come with me.

405
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,141
Mr. Blassi says he's coming in a moment.

406
00:47:30,137 --> 00:47:31,936
Main office, this is Kent, it's urgent.

407
00:47:31,937 --> 00:47:34,245
Please inform what is
sector fours reading.

408
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,237
<i>The consumption is equal
to standard lighting.</i>

409
00:47:37,238 --> 00:47:40,116
<i>In tunnels and stations,
plus an intern rolling</i>

410
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,018
Please specify consumption.

411
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,428
<i>Everything's normal boss, we only have</i>

412
00:47:47,429 --> 00:47:48,603
<i>you rolling.</i>

413
00:47:48,604 --> 00:47:52,196
Cut the main electricity provision.

414
00:47:52,197 --> 00:47:54,030
until I tell you.

415
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,007
<i>Done, boss. Now, what do we do?</i>

416
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:14,522
Watch the monitors and warn
me if you see any change.

417
00:48:16,993 --> 00:48:19,994
This is nuts, we've been
transiting only in one wagon

418
00:48:19,995 --> 00:48:22,882
- That's too much consumption.
- What's going on, Blassi?

419
00:48:22,883 --> 00:48:26,901
We have indications of a
train transiting by the system.

420
00:48:26,902 --> 00:48:29,576
When will we know the
circuit has been interrupted?

421
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,085
I don't know, maybe it's just a flight

422
00:48:33,086 --> 00:48:38,571
Yes of course, the flight
of a train inside the system.

423
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,559
Now we're going to check it

424
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,249
Restore the electricity

425
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,361
<i>Now there's consumption
at various sectors.</i>

426
00:48:57,362 --> 00:48:59,012
<i>Did you authorized this maneuver?</i>

427
00:48:59,013 --> 00:49:01,194
Different zones at the
network are registering that

428
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:04,032
Probably those are
unhooked wagons around.

429
00:49:04,033 --> 00:49:07,877
Can you please explain
us what's going on?

430
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,944
Gentlemen, I think the young
man has something to tell us.

431
00:49:42,362 --> 00:49:43,757
We have a disappeared train

432
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:46,416
with people.

433
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:49,714
But the system is closed

434
00:49:51,173 --> 00:49:52,530
Trains cannot go out.

435
00:49:55,265 --> 00:49:56,849
86 is at the system.

436
00:49:56,850 --> 00:49:58,485
What are you saying?

437
00:49:58,486 --> 00:50:01,737
All the system was checked and
It's not here, what do you think...

438
00:50:02,237 --> 00:50:03,823
that we're playing to 'hide the train'?

439
00:50:03,824 --> 00:50:07,850
Shut up Dr. Nazar. Let
him finish his explanation.

440
00:50:07,851 --> 00:50:10,437
We know the train was going
to the Plaza de Mayo station.

441
00:50:10,438 --> 00:50:15,173
The morning of the 4th... but
we also know it never arrived.

442
00:50:15,174 --> 00:50:16,797
Such a novelty, Prad.

443
00:50:16,798 --> 00:50:20,062
And when it entered the tunnel
that crosses Maldonado river...

444
00:50:20,063 --> 00:50:23,508
it transformed into a boat
and now's sailing to Africa.

445
00:50:23,509 --> 00:50:24,558
Excuse me, Dr.

446
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:29,129
How can you explain a train can..

447
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:31,815
be running wild around the
tracks since March 4th until today

448
00:50:31,816 --> 00:50:34,526
without being seen for almost 5 days?

449
00:50:35,127 --> 00:50:37,348
That's exactly like that engineer.

450
00:50:39,881 --> 00:50:41,492
Is that this train cannot be seen.

451
00:50:44,246 --> 00:50:47,656
This train... Intern 86

452
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,513
Without showing any kind
of mechanical failure

453
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,472
With the whole network working

454
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:56,719
With other 300 trains around

455
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,316
Somewhere during its route

456
00:51:01,648 --> 00:51:02,677
just vanished

457
00:51:05,245 --> 00:51:06,429
Somehow it found a node...

458
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:09,989
A node! What is 'a node'?

459
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:12,538
The system that keeps the track clean

460
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:15,092
In those, nothing else
but trains circulate

461
00:51:15,093 --> 00:51:16,485
I still don't understand.

462
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,017
A node is not an obstruction

463
00:51:22,962 --> 00:51:24,644
In topology...

464
00:51:24,645 --> 00:51:27,420
a node is a particularity

465
00:51:30,527 --> 00:51:32,168
A pole of superior order

466
00:51:32,169 --> 00:51:34,240
I don't understand anything.

467
00:51:34,241 --> 00:51:36,436
And I think nobody else does.

468
00:51:36,437 --> 00:51:39,377
Dr. Nazar, please don't
complicate things even more

469
00:51:39,378 --> 00:51:42,438
I think this was caused by a new branch

470
00:51:42,972 --> 00:51:45,496
And what does the perimetral
has to do with all this?

471
00:51:45,497 --> 00:51:47,866
The system is a network
with an amazing topological

472
00:51:47,867 --> 00:51:52,096
complexity, you'll see
from the latest extension.

473
00:51:53,624 --> 00:51:55,483
But the perimetral
must have done something

474
00:51:55,484 --> 00:51:59,330
absolutely singular.

475
00:51:59,331 --> 00:52:02,031
I still don't understand very well.

476
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:05,103
But I believe that the
new branch has taken

477
00:52:05,104 --> 00:52:06,730
the connectivity of the whole system

478
00:52:06,731 --> 00:52:07,899
to an order so high

479
00:52:09,804 --> 00:52:11,013
that I don't know how to calculate it.

480
00:52:11,014 --> 00:52:13,357
I think it has made it to infinity.

481
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:19,810
If it's like that
gentlemen, we can deduce

482
00:52:21,701 --> 00:52:24,302
that the system behaves
as a Moebius belt.

483
00:52:36,842 --> 00:52:37,770
May I?

484
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,491
If you look this paper,
you'll find out that

485
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:43,039
This is a simple two faced belt,

486
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,771
but if we join both extremes...

487
00:52:46,772 --> 00:52:53,107
like this, we obtain
a very particular belt.

488
00:52:54,567 --> 00:52:55,800
It's a one faced belt.

489
00:52:55,801 --> 00:52:58,765
on which we could circulate endlessly

490
00:53:00,259 --> 00:53:03,331
But this...

491
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,569
Translated to a subway network,

492
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,122
must have an infinite
number of particularities.

493
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:16,866
Could you imagine what can the properties
of a network like this could be?

494
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,320
I can't either.

495
00:53:22,472 --> 00:53:24,124
To tell you the truth...

496
00:53:25,417 --> 00:53:27,824
The structure of the whole
perimetral system, is way beyond

497
00:53:27,825 --> 00:53:28,970
my reach.

498
00:53:31,603 --> 00:53:33,651
I can't do anything but suppositions.

499
00:53:33,652 --> 00:53:35,350
This is outrageous.

500
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:39,510
We have 200 kilometers of tunnels

501
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:42,037
How can it be that a finite surface

502
00:53:42,038 --> 00:53:44,039
Can convert into an infinite one?

503
00:53:46,608 --> 00:53:47,849
That's a good question

504
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,239
But anyways it happened. It happened.

505
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:56,122
Do you have any idea
about the passengers?

506
00:53:57,586 --> 00:53:59,071
None.

507
00:53:59,072 --> 00:54:01,472
Hold on a minute, Prad.

508
00:54:01,473 --> 00:54:03,997
If what's making this whole confusion

509
00:54:03,998 --> 00:54:06,247
is the perimetral, first we close it.

510
00:54:06,248 --> 00:54:08,876
and then, if things are like you say

511
00:54:08,877 --> 00:54:11,387
We can keep on with
our normal operations.

512
00:54:11,388 --> 00:54:13,137
Without collision danger.

513
00:54:13,138 --> 00:54:15,819
If you close the perimetral,
the train will never reappear

514
00:54:17,805 --> 00:54:18,960
What is not certain

515
00:54:20,322 --> 00:54:21,103
is that when it appears...

516
00:54:21,104 --> 00:54:22,923
it will be translating
itself to the right direction.

517
00:54:26,374 --> 00:54:27,562
And in that case...

518
00:54:31,553 --> 00:54:32,637
An accident may be possible.

519
00:54:32,638 --> 00:54:37,466
Mr. Blassi, how many people
do you think are in that train?

520
00:54:37,467 --> 00:54:42,994
Well, I think between 30 or 40 people.

521
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,564
Hey Prad, you want us to believe that

522
00:54:48,565 --> 00:54:51,472
the train has jumped
to another dimension,

523
00:54:51,473 --> 00:54:54,351
that it's actually not inside the system

524
00:54:54,352 --> 00:54:57,737
that it's gone, isn't that true?

525
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:00,867
It's a way to say it.

526
00:55:00,868 --> 00:55:04,673
And this peculiar behavior

527
00:55:04,674 --> 00:55:08,371
has been produced by
certain mathematical

528
00:55:08,372 --> 00:55:13,256
properties associated to
the new perimetral joint?

529
00:55:14,608 --> 00:55:15,148
Exactly

530
00:55:15,149 --> 00:55:18,202
And is there anything we could
do to bring the train back

531
00:55:18,203 --> 00:55:21,756
to this dimension?

532
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:30,004
I don't know.

533
00:55:35,032 --> 00:55:36,536
Is this the possible explanation?

534
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:43,244
You're a lame.

535
00:55:43,245 --> 00:55:45,546
Is this the result of your study?

536
00:55:45,547 --> 00:55:47,328
Do you have any other idea?

537
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,421
It's a disgrace you've got no one

538
00:55:55,422 --> 00:55:57,719
that can give us a coherent explanation.

539
00:56:24,917 --> 00:56:29,731
Prad, one question. To avoid
the possibility of collision...

540
00:56:29,732 --> 00:56:32,360
Can't we leave the
perimetral joint open?

541
00:56:32,361 --> 00:56:34,333
But without the train to pass by it.

542
00:56:34,334 --> 00:56:36,962
So that if the train from above appears

543
00:56:36,963 --> 00:56:39,039
Couldn't crash with another train

544
00:56:41,263 --> 00:56:42,814
That wouldn't be an useful protection

545
00:56:42,815 --> 00:56:44,503
'Cause now with the new joint

546
00:56:44,504 --> 00:56:46,500
The whole network has
an infinite connectivity

547
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,186
Hey Mr. Mathematician!

548
00:56:49,187 --> 00:56:51,497
Do you think you made me
a favor in this subject?

549
00:56:51,498 --> 00:56:53,498
I don't want to see you
here, do you understand!?

550
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:57,333
Mr. Blassi, Mr. Blassi

551
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:02,210
I found this girl at the first
level walking by the tracks

552
00:57:25,449 --> 00:57:26,400
Where are we heading to now?

553
00:57:28,425 --> 00:57:31,732
Nowhere, besides you must go back home.

554
00:57:31,733 --> 00:57:32,971
Someone may be looking for you

555
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,800
What! Now to my home?

556
00:57:35,801 --> 00:57:37,551
Just now?

557
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:34,636
Come, we may ride it!

558
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:41,140
No, you go if you want. I
need to stay here for a while.

559
01:01:31,709 --> 01:01:32,715
<i>Your attention please</i>

560
01:01:32,716 --> 01:01:35,266
<i>We would like to let the people know</i>

561
01:01:35,267 --> 01:01:39,536
<i>That there are only 3 more
train boardings. Thank you.</i>

562
01:03:40,434 --> 01:03:41,640
<i>To all passengers.</i>

563
01:03:41,641 --> 01:03:44,642
<i>We'd like to inform you
that we have suspended</i>

564
01:03:44,643 --> 01:03:47,787
<i>The service due to line flaws.</i>

565
01:03:47,788 --> 01:03:52,215
<i>We're sorry for any inconvenience
this might have to you. Thank you.</i>

566
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,382
You had trouble arriving, didn't you?

567
01:11:28,190 --> 01:11:29,009
Dr. Mistein

568
01:11:32,828 --> 01:11:38,137
Calm down. I know you've got
a lot of questions to ask.

569
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,299
We're traveling at an impossible speed

570
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:48,406
A simple track change.

571
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:52,350
The train crossed a joint after a curve

572
01:11:53,942 --> 01:11:55,696
The just combination

573
01:11:55,697 --> 01:11:57,785
At the right moment

574
01:11:57,786 --> 01:12:01,761
To apply the properties
of a Moebius belt

575
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:09,319
Invented the perfect machine

576
01:12:11,641 --> 01:12:13,394
That's blasphemy, son.

577
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,886
Man has invented numerous machines

578
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,944
But he forgets he is himself a machine

579
01:12:19,945 --> 01:12:23,255
Much more complicated than any
machine no one has ever built.

580
01:12:23,256 --> 01:12:25,125
There will be no limits now.

581
01:12:25,126 --> 01:12:26,968
There never were.

582
01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:32,114
Man doesn't know neither his
limits nor his possibilities.

583
01:12:34,819 --> 01:12:38,115
He doesn't even know 'till
what point he knows himself.

584
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:47,235
But of course, we are
so busy trying to find

585
01:12:47,236 --> 01:12:48,860
external values

586
01:12:51,547 --> 01:12:54,837
that we don't care what really matters

587
01:12:54,838 --> 01:12:56,859
But this is important

588
01:12:58,870 --> 01:13:00,867
I should say it and
everything would just change

589
01:13:00,868 --> 01:13:02,662
But you said it!

590
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:05,990
You explained it perfectly

591
01:13:05,991 --> 01:13:08,826
Today I passed by the Park Station

592
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,483
And was able to look at you while

593
01:13:12,484 --> 01:13:15,716
you were trying to
explain Moebius theory

594
01:13:18,554 --> 01:13:20,095
But, has someone believed you?

595
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:21,974
No...

596
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:24,906
But they'll believe you

597
01:13:24,907 --> 01:13:31,387
No, I would have used
the same words you used.

598
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:34,231
I would have said the truth

599
01:13:36,218 --> 01:13:38,530
What happens is that we live in a word

600
01:13:38,531 --> 01:13:41,405
where no one listens, my dear Prad.

601
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:52,357
What do you plan to do with it?

602
01:13:52,358 --> 01:13:54,803
- Nothing.
- What do you mean "nothing"?

603
01:13:54,804 --> 01:13:56,581
Don't worry Prad.

604
01:13:59,212 --> 01:14:01,123
The moment will arrive.

605
01:14:07,191 --> 01:14:19,239
Don't they understand what's going on?

606
01:14:21,137 --> 01:14:25,761
They... they will never awake

607
01:14:25,762 --> 01:14:29,248
Before finding out that they are asleep

608
01:14:38,621 --> 01:14:40,081
What are you afraid of Prad?

609
01:14:41,687 --> 01:14:42,757
Vertigo.

610
01:14:42,758 --> 01:14:44,782
That's normal

611
01:14:46,501 --> 01:14:50,401
No one can face the infinite
without feeling vertigo

612
01:14:51,814 --> 01:14:56,637
No one can experiment it without
feeling a deep disagreement

613
01:15:21,302 --> 01:15:24,654
If we're moving at the speed of thought

614
01:16:07,349 --> 01:16:11,040
How can someone be charmed of this life

615
01:16:11,041 --> 01:16:16,205
without attractiveness,
ingenuity or spontaneity

616
01:16:16,206 --> 01:16:20,139
Why shouldn't I prefer to
stay here in the shadows

617
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:23,374
If out there is a sea of deafness

618
01:16:23,375 --> 01:16:28,208
That is taking us to be
irremediably ungrateful.

619
01:16:40,997 --> 01:16:42,865
It can't be possible
that all this gets lost

620
01:16:52,127 --> 01:16:56,714
Stay here in our souls

621
01:17:55,964 --> 01:17:57,182
Sir, sir, sir.

622
01:17:57,183 --> 01:17:59,337
The train was here
already when we arrived.

623
01:17:59,338 --> 01:18:01,194
How much time since it's here?

624
01:18:01,195 --> 01:18:04,130
I don't know, we asked to the guarding
personnel, and they know nothing about it either.

625
01:18:04,131 --> 01:18:06,850
Sir... what do we do?

626
01:18:06,851 --> 01:18:08,738
Wait, wait here.

627
01:19:07,368 --> 01:19:10,688
And Blassi, so much trouble
and the train was here?

628
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:15,978
Moebius

629
01:19:18,135 --> 01:19:20,478
Take it to the garage and
let's forget about this matter.

630
01:19:20,479 --> 01:19:21,896
Understood?

631
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:34,011
Nothing has happened here.

632
01:21:05,069 --> 01:21:07,795
I never imagined what will happen to me

633
01:21:08,803 --> 01:21:11,828
As soon as I reached the
86, I found my old professor

634
01:21:11,829 --> 01:21:13,743
Tired of repeating the same story

635
01:21:14,665 --> 01:21:17,736
Tired of fighting and speaking
'till death just to be ignored

636
01:21:18,777 --> 01:21:22,449
And in that precise moment, I felt
he was putting his time in my hands.

637
01:21:23,842 --> 01:21:26,285
It's not difficult to understand
why I decided to follow his steps

638
01:21:26,286 --> 01:21:28,528
In this no return trip

639
01:21:28,529 --> 01:21:32,671
Before trying to lose my time
trying to explain to a group of fools

640
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:34,644
Something they don't wish to understand

641
01:21:36,470 --> 01:21:39,475
Anyhow, the old man was right

642
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:43,844
We live in a word where
nobody listens anymore

643
01:22:24,834 --> 01:22:33,517
Hello? Yes? What? I don't understand,
are you sure about what you're telling me?

644
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,481
Lost... what was lost?

645
01:22:41,201 --> 01:22:47,718
Mr. CEO, Mr. CEO...

646
01:22:51,966 --> 01:22:53,466
