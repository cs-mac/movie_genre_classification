1
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:02,361
Good morning, Mr. Thalberg.
Good morning.

2
00:01:02,361 --> 00:01:04,829
Good morning, Irving.
Hello.

3
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:05,990
Hello. George.

4
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,590
Right this way, Irving.

5
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:18,504
The actor is
a very special human being.

6
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:23,406
There are only a few who
possess his peculiar magic,

7
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:27,446
that extraordinary ability
to make us feel,

8
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:30,176
to lift us out
of our own existence

9
00:02:30,176 --> 00:02:33,447
and make us believe
in the world of make believe.

10
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,982
I am speaking of
the great ones now,

11
00:02:36,982 --> 00:02:40,583
those that audiences
have selected and set apart.

12
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:45,097
Some no longer here to enchant you,
but, well, will always be remembered.

13
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:50,831
We cannot replace these personalities.
There can only be one of each,

14
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,832
born out of their own
personal joys and sorrows.

15
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:58,404
Life shapes them
in wondrous ways.

16
00:02:58,404 --> 00:03:02,107
Often beautiful, sometimes
with flaws, but all quite rare.

17
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,874
Such a one was Lon Chaney.

18
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:10,780
With his God-given talent, he did
more than just portray 1,000 faces.

19
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,851
He illuminated certain dark
corners of the human spirit.

20
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:18,530
He showed the world
the souls of those people

21
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,192
who are born different
from the rest.

22
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:25,596
To understand why he was destined for
this, we would only have to go back

23
00:03:25,596 --> 00:03:29,506
to any day in his boyhood, in
the town of Colorado Springs.

24
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,201
<i>Not a very easy boyhood,</i>

25
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,241
<i>for his parents
were different.</i>

26
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,477
Lon! You've been
fighting again.

27
00:03:37,477 --> 00:03:40,781
Ma and Pa don't care if kids
make fun of them, why should you?

28
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:43,014
Go play with your dolls!

29
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:04,734
What happened?

30
00:04:04,734 --> 00:04:06,779
It's always the same,
isn't it?

31
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,042
I better go help.

32
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:33,334
Don't be angry. Feel sorry for
those who do not understand like you.

33
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,565
They're no good!

34
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:37,836
Go wash.

35
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:05,262
Lon! Hey, Chaney!
Stone wants you!

36
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:09,531
Tell him I'll be there
in a second.

37
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,188
What's up?
Ask the boss!

38
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,068
Listen to them, they're
stamping holes in the floor.

39
00:05:37,068 --> 00:05:38,501
Where's Cleva?
Dressing.

40
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:41,540
One song. One song, while we
get set up for the acrobats,

41
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,973
and she's never ready. I paid
a lot of money for this curtain.

42
00:05:43,973 --> 00:05:45,476
I pay your wife
to stand in front of it.

43
00:05:45,476 --> 00:05:47,604
All right,
you made your point.

44
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,413
She holds us up again,
she's through!

45
00:05:54,413 --> 00:05:55,476
Cleva, sweetheart.

46
00:05:55,476 --> 00:05:57,216
I know, I know.

47
00:05:57,216 --> 00:05:58,279
I'm late again.

48
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,882
Take it easy, now. Easy.

49
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:04,658
All right, hurry up!

50
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:10,565
Now, it's all right,
sweet, we'll fix it.

51
00:06:10,565 --> 00:06:11,967
It's ruined.
We'll fix it. We'll fix it.

52
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,903
Never mind. Never mind.

53
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,198
That does it.
She's out!

54
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:28,747
What are you doing?

55
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:32,681
You want somebody
in front of that

56
00:06:32,681 --> 00:06:33,783
very expensive curtain,
don't you?

57
00:06:33,783 --> 00:06:35,760
You've already been on.

58
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,966
That's more like it.
That stays in.

59
00:09:01,966 --> 00:09:03,065
You like the bit?

60
00:09:03,065 --> 00:09:05,872
Well, here, it's yours,
you can have it.

61
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:07,876
Hey, Lon!

62
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,776
Lon, we can
talk this over.

63
00:09:10,776 --> 00:09:12,010
I'm sorry, sorry.

64
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:14,645
You fired her,
you fired me.

65
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,461
That piker!

66
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:30,458
Paying us off in potato peelings
and wanted us to take a $10 cut.

67
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:33,130
Well, I wish you
could have heard me.

68
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,733
I told him.

69
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:35,865
Lon, you didn't quit?

70
00:09:35,865 --> 00:09:37,204
We both quit.

71
00:09:37,204 --> 00:09:41,178
We're gonna get off this wreck
before it goes down with all hands.

72
00:09:41,178 --> 00:09:43,010
It's because of me,
isn't it?

73
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,310
Uh-uh-uh.

74
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:48,285
Don't let those get on the floor.
Be over our heads in no time.

75
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,280
Lon, what're we going to do?

76
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,416
There are other shows,

77
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:57,724
and maybe we can land in a dressing room
where we won't have to wear hip boots.

78
00:09:57,724 --> 00:09:59,560
Maybe San Francisco.

79
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,299
Why San Francisco?

80
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:04,495
The offer you got
from Kolb and Dill.

81
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,405
I found the telegram
in your suit.

82
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:12,503
They didn't want me, either, did
they? That's why you turned it down.

83
00:10:12,503 --> 00:10:14,603
We can have
Kolb and Dill anytime.

84
00:10:14,603 --> 00:10:15,704
We can do better.
Leave it to me.

85
00:10:15,704 --> 00:10:18,113
Take it, Lon.
Wire them tonight.

86
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,651
You want me to?
Hmm? You sure?

87
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:27,990
In a few months I won't have
much of a specialty anyway,

88
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:31,120
unless they'd like to
watch me folding diapers.

89
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,971
Sweetheart. Sweetheart.

90
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:43,630
This is wonderful! Wonderful!

91
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,339
Your feet dry?

92
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,708
Wait till the folks
hear about this.

93
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,576
What a Christmas present.

94
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:57,652
I'll wire them tonight.

95
00:10:57,652 --> 00:10:59,156
Why not tell them, instead?

96
00:10:59,156 --> 00:11:01,193
Tell them?

97
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:02,625
I want to meet
your family, Lon.

98
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:06,093
Well, but... Yeah,
but we haven't got time.

99
00:11:06,093 --> 00:11:07,154
We gotta get to the coast.

100
00:11:07,154 --> 00:11:08,791
We've got a whole week.

101
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:12,133
They didn't want you till
after the first of the year.

102
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:15,272
And I want to make this
Christmas special,

103
00:11:15,272 --> 00:11:17,866
in a home, instead of a hotel room.

104
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:20,268
Yeah, sure, I know,
but you see, sweetheart...

105
00:11:20,268 --> 00:11:22,576
Lon, is it me?

106
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,249
Are you ashamed
to take me home?

107
00:11:26,249 --> 00:11:28,650
Now, what kind of talk
is that?

108
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,949
Well, then, please.

109
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,157
You're supposed to humor
an expectant mother, you know?

110
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:39,025
Yeah, well,

111
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,756
if that's what you want,

112
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,303
home we go.

113
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:00,844
Lon, I'm scared.

114
00:12:00,844 --> 00:12:01,944
They're gonna
love you very much.

115
00:12:01,944 --> 00:12:04,546
Just remember that. Hey!

116
00:12:04,546 --> 00:12:06,591
Welcome to Colorado Springs!

117
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,383
Cleva, my brother, John.
Hello.

118
00:12:09,383 --> 00:12:13,159
Say, you're the prettiest Christmas
present anybody ever brought home.

119
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:14,699
I said that at the train.

120
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:15,893
How'd you get so lucky?

121
00:12:15,893 --> 00:12:18,300
She found me
on her door step.

122
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,167
Good to see you.
Let me help you.

123
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:21,729
No, I'll get them.

124
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,141
Lon. Oh, Lon.

125
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:31,643
Well, how's my
favorite sister?

126
00:12:31,643 --> 00:12:33,912
Your only sister's
just fine.

127
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,915
Well, here she is, Carrie.

128
00:12:36,915 --> 00:12:38,650
Lon didn't exaggerate
in his letters.

129
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,448
She's lovely.

130
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:42,824
Hi.
Hi.

131
00:12:42,824 --> 00:12:45,125
Hey, look here, now.
Look here. Hmm?

132
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,028
<i>I was in a show once called
Ring In The Dawn.</i>

133
00:12:47,028 --> 00:12:49,693
Folded in three nights. They
paid me off with the bell.

134
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,305
Folks around?
Out on a shopping spree.

135
00:12:57,305 --> 00:12:59,844
They wanted to get
something special for Cleva.

136
00:12:59,844 --> 00:13:01,038
They shouldn't
have done that.

137
00:13:01,038 --> 00:13:02,239
No way to stop them.

138
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:05,044
After all, they don't meet a
new daughter-in-law every day.

139
00:13:05,044 --> 00:13:08,553
Here, let me take your things.
Lon, you've got your old room back.

140
00:13:08,553 --> 00:13:10,851
George and I are doubling up.
Just like old times.

141
00:13:10,851 --> 00:13:14,916
Yeah, he snores worse than ever.
What a Christmas this is gonna be.

142
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,484
For you.
Hey!

143
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,226
Got it?
Yeah.

144
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:22,257
Here.

145
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,297
I'm not the only
hoofer in the family.

146
00:13:26,297 --> 00:13:28,932
The folks won this
in a waltz contest.

147
00:13:28,932 --> 00:13:30,032
It's beautiful.

148
00:13:30,032 --> 00:13:32,441
It was the proudest
night in our lives.

149
00:13:32,441 --> 00:13:35,776
How are they? No different,
Lon. Great! You know.

150
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,648
Is Christmas
always like this?

151
00:13:39,648 --> 00:13:41,913
Like what? To the right.

152
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,556
You know, so much fuss, so warm.

153
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,125
Always that way
with the Chaneys.

154
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:52,255
Not with the Creightons.
Ma hired out.

155
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,799
Holidays, she'd
work her hardest.

156
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:58,769
I used to wait up for her, and we'd
pretend there was a tree in the corner

157
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:01,830
with a lot of presents
wrapped in red ribbons.

158
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:06,708
Sweetheart, from here in,
it's all gonna be red ribbons.

159
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,675
Tell me, you ever done any lake
fishing through a hole in the ice?

160
00:14:11,675 --> 00:14:13,547
Never fished in my life.

161
00:14:13,547 --> 00:14:15,086
Never fished in your life?

162
00:14:15,086 --> 00:14:16,587
Well, it's about time
you got started.

163
00:14:16,587 --> 00:14:18,486
You can't be admitted
to the Chaney clan

164
00:14:18,486 --> 00:14:20,752
until you've caught
your first mountain trout.

165
00:14:20,752 --> 00:14:22,794
Well, anyway, I can try.

166
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,562
What is it?

167
00:14:25,562 --> 00:14:27,258
Folks are coming.

168
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:28,865
I didn't hear anything.

169
00:14:28,865 --> 00:14:30,026
I did.

170
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:33,931
Cleva...
Hmm?

171
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,870
Cleva, my mother and father.

172
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:52,373
How do you do?

173
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,410
Dinner's ready.

174
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,357
Cleva.

175
00:16:08,357 --> 00:16:10,834
Lon, they're deaf...
Cleva! Please.

176
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,666
Don't let them
see that look. Please.

177
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,196
Grace.

178
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,614
Dear God, bless this
food and this house.

179
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:03,412
And thank you for the gift
of your son and my sons.

180
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,424
And for my daughters.

181
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,448
Amen.

182
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:20,302
Pa says it's for the wandering
son to slice the bird.

183
00:17:20,302 --> 00:17:22,863
All right, well, let's
see, now. No prompting.

184
00:17:22,863 --> 00:17:25,409
Now, Mom, white meat. Dad,
dark, and heavy on the gravy.

185
00:17:25,409 --> 00:17:27,468
John and Carrie,
drumsticks or wings,

186
00:17:27,468 --> 00:17:28,877
and George, because you're
the baby of the family,

187
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,516
Last part over the fence.

188
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:41,949
What's wrong?

189
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:53,969
Cleva.

190
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,368
Why didn't you
tell me, Lon?

191
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,923
I wanted to, sweetheart.

192
00:18:14,923 --> 00:18:17,655
I tried, but I was scared.

193
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:21,564
I tried, but I couldn't.

194
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:34,775
All right, all right, I'll tell you.

195
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:39,378
I couldn't, because I thought
it would be the end of us.

196
00:18:39,378 --> 00:18:41,851
Because I was afraid
to lose you.

197
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:47,191
I thought if you saw them, just
another family, like any other...

198
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:54,356
Was it that hard
to look at them, Cleva?

199
00:18:54,356 --> 00:18:55,923
I couldn't stand it.

200
00:18:55,923 --> 00:18:57,366
Why? Because
they're different?

201
00:18:57,366 --> 00:18:59,529
Because they can't speak?
Does that make them freaks?

202
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:01,368
Don't shout, Lon!
They can't hear me!

203
00:19:01,368 --> 00:19:02,771
What did you expect of me?

204
00:19:02,771 --> 00:19:04,934
That I was going to accept
things all in a minute?

205
00:19:04,934 --> 00:19:06,034
You grew up with them.

206
00:19:06,034 --> 00:19:07,408
They've talked to me
all my life.

207
00:19:07,408 --> 00:19:09,208
With their hands!
Yes, I can hear them.

208
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,772
I've always heard them.
Then ask them about my baby.

209
00:19:11,772 --> 00:19:16,048
Ask them what my baby's going
to be like. Will it be like them?

210
00:19:16,048 --> 00:19:19,022
It's in your blood, Lon.
It can happen again!

211
00:19:19,022 --> 00:19:22,527
I don't want to have it!
I don't want to have it!

212
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:25,563
I don't want to be
mother to a dumb thing!

213
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:19,611
You don't understand. It's your
responsibility to tell your wife.

214
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:24,987
Are you afraid? Or ashamed? You
must ask your wife to forgive you.

215
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:28,723
Words are not important.

216
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,269
Now!

217
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,685
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
It was all my fault.

218
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,181
Mom is right,
I should have told you.

219
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:36,089
Cleva, please
try to understand.

220
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,827
This didn't start
just tonight.

221
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:44,030
All my life, I've had it. All
my life, it's been the same.

222
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:47,162
Kids tagging after my father
and mother, making signs,

223
00:21:47,162 --> 00:21:49,969
yelling, "Hey, dummy!
Hey, dummy!"

224
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:53,433
So proud they could speak,
they had to be cruel.

225
00:21:53,433 --> 00:21:56,481
Until I was eight, I
never talked in the street,

226
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,574
just to make them think I couldn't,
and when they yelled at me,

227
00:21:59,574 --> 00:22:01,983
I paid them back
for my father and mother,

228
00:22:01,983 --> 00:22:04,147
and I grew up
paying them back.

229
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:10,419
Cleva, can you
ever forgive me?

230
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:14,326
It doesn't matter.

231
00:22:14,326 --> 00:22:17,630
Sweetheart, our baby's gonna
be all right. You'll see.

232
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:21,332
Why, we've got a houseful of voices
here. John, Carrie and George.

233
00:22:21,332 --> 00:22:24,739
It didn't happen to any of us, and
it won't happen to our kid, either.

234
00:22:24,739 --> 00:22:26,209
Believe me.

235
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:32,276
Cleva, sweetheart,

236
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:36,380
I want that baby.

237
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:40,986
I don't.

238
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,724
But I'll have it.

239
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:04,375
Thanks.

240
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,690
Good.
Fair.

241
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,994
Magician?

242
00:23:21,994 --> 00:23:23,329
Press agent.

243
00:23:23,329 --> 00:23:24,460
I'm Lon Chaney.

244
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,266
Oh, yes, yes. We've been waiting for you.

245
00:23:27,266 --> 00:23:28,829
I'm Clarence Locan.

246
00:23:28,829 --> 00:23:31,876
I'll see that your name is
spelled right in the papers.

247
00:23:31,876 --> 00:23:33,877
Mr. Dill, Chaney's here.

248
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:36,877
Okay, girls, on your feet, on your feet!

249
00:23:36,877 --> 00:23:39,280
And look like swans,
not ducks!

250
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,283
Take it again
from the top.

251
00:23:41,283 --> 00:23:43,480
Okay, girls.
With long necks.

252
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:53,490
Glad you got here, Chaney,
but just for the records,

253
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,897
with Kolb and Dill, rehearsals
are just like a performance.

254
00:23:55,897 --> 00:23:57,025
They start on time.

255
00:23:57,025 --> 00:23:58,194
I'm sorry, Mr. Dill,

256
00:23:58,194 --> 00:23:59,430
but I was getting
settled in a new house.

257
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,495
Needed a special kind of
place out in the country,

258
00:24:01,495 --> 00:24:04,906
far away from everything.
You see, I'm having a baby.

259
00:24:04,906 --> 00:24:07,740
Okay, I love children
as much as the next man,

260
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,940
but don't let it
happen again.

261
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,482
Rehearsals, I mean.
I won't.

262
00:24:11,482 --> 00:24:13,609
Starting a baby album?
No, press book.

263
00:24:13,609 --> 00:24:15,448
Saves a lot of talk.

264
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:20,348
Hmm.

265
00:24:20,348 --> 00:24:22,325
Your sketches?
Yes.

266
00:24:22,325 --> 00:24:23,918
Do a little scenery too,
if it's needed.

267
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:26,723
Not bad.

268
00:24:26,723 --> 00:24:28,197
I hear you do
a pretty good dumb act.

269
00:24:28,197 --> 00:24:30,166
I've been doing that
since I was a kid.

270
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:32,294
Where'd you learn it?
Parents.

271
00:24:32,294 --> 00:24:34,634
Show business?
Mmm-hmm. Deaf.

272
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:38,139
Mutes?

273
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:44,138
Well, don't let it bother you,
Mr. Dill. It doesn't bother them.

274
00:24:44,138 --> 00:24:45,513
Well, shall we go to work?

275
00:24:45,513 --> 00:24:46,608
Come on, Lon,

276
00:24:46,608 --> 00:24:49,210
I'll show you
to the dressing room.

277
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:34,928
Do you want me
to turn it off?

278
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,693
No, no, it's all right.

279
00:25:37,693 --> 00:25:39,168
Just tell me, if you do.

280
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,133
Cleva, if you like to hear it, it's fine.

281
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:48,177
But I don't like to hear
it, Lon, that's the point.

282
00:25:48,177 --> 00:25:52,182
I don't really want to
hear it. I'd rather talk!

283
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:56,849
About what you're doing at the
theater, the weather, anything.

284
00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:02,526
Month after month, it's
"Hello" and "Good night,"

285
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:05,189
and nothing in between.

286
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:09,325
Cleva, we keep trying
to talk to each other.

287
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:12,335
If I tell you we had
a good matinee,

288
00:26:12,335 --> 00:26:16,067
you ask about the kids in the
audience, how they liked it,

289
00:26:16,067 --> 00:26:18,132
how much noise they made.

290
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,205
We always get back
to the same thing.

291
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:22,303
Now it's my fault!

292
00:26:22,303 --> 00:26:23,404
I didn't say that.

293
00:26:23,404 --> 00:26:25,244
It's what you meant.

294
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:30,385
It's this place.
It's like being buried.

295
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:33,522
No one around,
nobody to talk to.

296
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:37,422
Why couldn't we have stayed in the
city like everybody else in the show,

297
00:26:37,422 --> 00:26:40,328
where there's some life,
some excitement?

298
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:45,236
Or would that have been
too normal? Is that it, Lon?

299
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:48,672
Are you trying to get me
used to the silence?

300
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:53,567
Cleva, the doctor says
there's every reason to expect

301
00:26:53,567 --> 00:26:55,840
that everything
is going to be fine.

302
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,475
There's nothing...
Nothing to be afraid of.

303
00:26:59,475 --> 00:27:01,883
Maybe you can be
strong about it.

304
00:27:01,883 --> 00:27:04,717
I can't. I'm scared.

305
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:09,023
So scared I could scream.

306
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:36,543
Dummy! Dummy! Dummy!

307
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:56,040
Go back to sleep, Cleva.

308
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:33,275
Lon, I did hear him cry?

309
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:35,472
I wasn't asleep?

310
00:28:35,472 --> 00:28:36,809
No, you heard him.

311
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:40,009
Mrs. Chaney, when a baby
is picked up by the heels

312
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:43,248
and slapped on the rump,
he's bound to resent it.

313
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,321
Then he's all right.

314
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,961
What is it?

315
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,030
Cleva, the baby cried,
but there's...

316
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:58,433
It's a little too soon to know
for certain if he can hear.

317
00:28:58,433 --> 00:29:01,529
The fact that he cried
is no indication.

318
00:29:01,529 --> 00:29:04,632
When we know definitely
that he reacts to sound,

319
00:29:04,632 --> 00:29:07,439
we can be sure
that he'll learn to speak.

320
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,214
We won't know for
a couple of weeks.

321
00:29:10,214 --> 00:29:12,647
He's a fine boy,
Mrs. Chaney.

322
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:16,715
Would you like to see him? I'll
have the nurse bring him in.

323
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:38,700
Mr. Chaney?

324
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,244
That's right.

325
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:50,587
If there's an answer,
I can take it with me.

326
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:55,386
What is it, Lon?

327
00:29:55,386 --> 00:29:57,121
From the folks.
They're worried.

328
00:29:57,121 --> 00:30:01,131
They haven't heard from us since
the night the baby was born.

329
00:30:01,131 --> 00:30:03,531
What are you
going to tell them?

330
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,637
No answer.

331
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:19,945
He's still sleeping.

332
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:24,053
The doorbell woke me,
but he didn't hear it.

333
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,910
God, I have never
asked for anything before,

334
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:51,073
but this I want more
than anything in my life.

335
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:56,349
Do you have to
pray like that?

336
00:30:56,349 --> 00:30:58,855
Do you have to
keep me out of it?

337
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,793
I wouldn't know how to mean it any other way.

338
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:11,894
Please, let my baby
hear and talk.

339
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:17,207
Please, God, please. Amen.

340
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:48,505
Lon! Lon, he heard you!

341
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:56,039
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, my son.
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.

342
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:00,846
That's the last time
anybody will ever scare you.

343
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,917
No, no, no.

344
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:18,602
Wait, please.

345
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:29,076
Hello, Mrs. Chaney,
and the big fella.

346
00:32:29,076 --> 00:32:31,877
Well, it's about time
youse coming to see us again.

347
00:32:31,877 --> 00:32:33,315
Growing like a weed,
ain't he?

348
00:32:33,315 --> 00:32:34,943
Scotty, would you take
Creighton to his father

349
00:32:34,943 --> 00:32:36,612
and tell him I'll see
them both at home tonight?

350
00:32:36,612 --> 00:32:38,781
Well, now, there's a couple
of minutes before he goes on.

351
00:32:38,781 --> 00:32:40,256
Why don't you...
No, no, I'm late already.

352
00:32:40,256 --> 00:32:43,089
Just tell him,
please. Thanks.

353
00:32:43,089 --> 00:32:44,594
Well, come on, Creighton.

354
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,321
Hi!

355
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:49,394
What's the matter? Cat got your tongue? Nope.

356
00:32:49,394 --> 00:32:53,165
Just quiet like your daddy,
huh? Can't you even say hello?

357
00:32:53,165 --> 00:32:55,206
Hi.
That's much better.

358
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:57,002
Now no flirting with
the dancing girls, sonny.

359
00:32:57,002 --> 00:32:59,908
Come on, let's go
find your daddy, okay?

360
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:07,584
Well, look who's here! Hi,
wait a minute. Wait a minute.

361
00:33:07,953 --> 00:33:10,183
Girls, come on,
now. Come on.

362
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:15,254
Mr. Chaney,
you have company.

363
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:20,194
Daddy! Daddy!

364
00:33:20,194 --> 00:33:23,166
My boy, my boy. My boy!

365
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:25,499
My boy, my boy, my boy!

366
00:33:25,499 --> 00:33:28,130
Uncle Clarence, did you bring me a present?

367
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:31,972
Well, you came to see us, you remember?
This kid's gonna get along swell!

368
00:33:31,972 --> 00:33:34,034
Where's your mother? Mrs.
Chaney had an appointment.

369
00:33:34,034 --> 00:33:36,808
She said she'd see you
at home tonight.

370
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:43,614
I'll take care of him while
you're on. He's my new fellow.

371
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:46,112
Thanks, Miss Bennett.

372
00:33:46,112 --> 00:33:47,852
That's all right.

373
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,124
Creighton, come here.

374
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:15,684
Here we go.

375
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:30,224
Daddy, show me a story.

376
00:34:30,224 --> 00:34:33,499
Now, way too late
and you're much too sleepy.

377
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:36,132
Please, just one, Daddy.

378
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:41,908
<i>The one you said was Grandma's
favorite, Old Lady Murgatroyd.</i>

379
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,177
<i>Old Lady Murgatroyd?
Yeah.</i>

380
00:34:44,177 --> 00:34:47,241
I'll tell you what.
Now we'll have a race.

381
00:34:47,241 --> 00:34:51,346
You get into these, and get
tucked in by the time I'm ready.

382
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:53,486
Okay.
It's a race.

383
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:07,671
Come on, now.

384
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:13,971
Faster than that! You hear?

385
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:52,977
And now, young man,
young man, you go to sleep.

386
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:57,037
And go to sleep right now, do you
hear me? Go to sleep right now.

387
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,421
Well, say it.

388
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:18,519
All right, I'm working. I took a job.

389
00:38:20,165 --> 00:38:22,065
I'm singing at Lait's.

390
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:25,866
What about Creighton?

391
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:29,769
I found a woman,
a wonderful woman.

392
00:38:29,769 --> 00:38:31,536
She'll come in the morning
and be with him till I get up,

393
00:38:31,536 --> 00:38:33,304
and then she'll stay
until you come home at night.

394
00:38:33,304 --> 00:38:35,039
Except Thursdays.

395
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:37,712
What do we do on Thursdays?

396
00:38:37,712 --> 00:38:39,647
Give him a dime and let him go on the town?

397
00:38:39,647 --> 00:38:42,515
You can take him
to the theater with you.

398
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:45,317
Don't make it
sound so awful.

399
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:50,892
Mommy?

400
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:56,500
Yes, sweetheart, I'm here.

401
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,729
Did you bring me anything?

402
00:38:58,729 --> 00:39:01,465
No, I didn't, baby.
There wasn't...

403
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:04,099
Oh, yes, I did, too.

404
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,034
See here. Look.

405
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:09,175
What does it do?

406
00:39:09,175 --> 00:39:10,271
It's a nugget.

407
00:39:10,271 --> 00:39:12,748
A real gold nugget.

408
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,412
Gosh!

409
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:17,849
Where'd you get it?

410
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,820
A customer had a little
bit too much champagne.

411
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,918
He gave it to me for luck.

412
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:32,329
Good night, Son.
Go back to sleep.

413
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:39,470
I'll save it
for you, darling.

414
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:54,719
The gold rush is over. You're
quitting Lait's tomorrow.

415
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:56,817
You're not leaving my son
in the hands of a stranger.

416
00:39:56,817 --> 00:40:00,387
Lon, she's experienced. Takes
care of children all the time.

417
00:40:00,387 --> 00:40:03,025
And what's wrong with my
wanting to do something?

418
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,432
Lots of women
have careers.

419
00:40:04,432 --> 00:40:06,197
Creighton is more
important than a career.

420
00:40:06,197 --> 00:40:08,637
There's time for both.

421
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:15,602
They liked me tonight,
and I like their liking me.

422
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:19,716
It's what I want to do.

423
00:40:20,652 --> 00:40:22,882
Maybe when the boy's older.

424
00:40:22,882 --> 00:40:26,788
How much older, Lon? When?
How tall must he be?

425
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:30,393
I'm sick of being alone,
never seeing anyone.

426
00:40:30,862 --> 00:40:33,160
Sometimes I get the feeling
that Creighton and I

427
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,256
are the only two people
in the world.

428
00:40:35,256 --> 00:40:36,823
I am home
every minute I can be.

429
00:40:36,823 --> 00:40:39,392
Only to be with
your son, not me.

430
00:40:39,392 --> 00:40:42,530
I might as well be
1,000 miles away.

431
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:44,768
We've become strangers, Lon.

432
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:49,338
Maybe it's because I once
said I didn't want your child.

433
00:40:49,338 --> 00:40:51,314
You can't forgive me.

434
00:40:51,314 --> 00:40:55,614
Well, I love him too, but I've got
to make some kind of life of my own.

435
00:40:55,614 --> 00:40:59,851
I have the chance now, and you're
not going to take it away from me.

436
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,989
We haven't finished
talking about this.

437
00:41:02,989 --> 00:41:07,020
Surprise, Lon. For once, I
don't want to talk anymore.

438
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:17,733
If you liked me any better,
I couldn't stand it.

439
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,001
Then we are friends?

440
00:41:20,001 --> 00:41:21,204
Friends.

441
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:26,078
What a sour face.
He didn't like us tonight.

442
00:41:26,078 --> 00:41:27,481
Not a smile.

443
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:32,714
Watch this.

444
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:38,426
Flowers. Butterflies.
I can't. I can't.

445
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:48,897
You see? I made it! The
sneeze goes back into the act.

446
00:41:48,897 --> 00:41:53,137
Yeah, already he's a critic.
Creighton, what's with you?

447
00:41:53,137 --> 00:41:56,977
With me? It's fine.
Hiya, Pop, what's with you?

448
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:02,844
You know, pretty soon we put him in
the act, and then he's got to laugh!

449
00:42:02,844 --> 00:42:04,945
Past your bedtime, Son.
I'll take him, Lon.

450
00:42:04,945 --> 00:42:08,515
See, what did I tell you? We
put the sneeze back into the act.

451
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,970
Lon, you seen this? Look.

452
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:26,336
The whole show's built around her.
Not bad after three months, huh?

453
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:29,643
Well, you're going,
aren't you?

454
00:42:29,643 --> 00:42:30,874
No.

455
00:42:30,874 --> 00:42:33,473
Look, Lon, I can take
Creighton home with me.

456
00:42:33,473 --> 00:42:36,714
We get along great.
I tell him whoppers,

457
00:42:36,714 --> 00:42:39,552
and the bigger the whopper,
the better he likes it.

458
00:42:39,552 --> 00:42:42,650
This is a big night for her.
You should go.

459
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,988
I was not invited.

460
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:47,893
Where are you going?

461
00:42:47,893 --> 00:42:50,729
Just down to the
drugstore for a minute.

462
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:56,370
Now, Lon,
don't get panicky.

463
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:58,875
When I wasn't looking, Ruby
loaded him with ice cream.

464
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:02,344
His little stomach's just
a little upset, that's all.

465
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:04,603
See?

466
00:43:06,651 --> 00:43:10,212
Clarence, will you run down
to the drugstore?

467
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:12,085
Tell the druggist Creighton
has an upset stomach.

468
00:43:12,085 --> 00:43:13,145
Have him fix something.

469
00:43:13,145 --> 00:43:14,350
Sure.

470
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:20,087
Hazel, a favor?

471
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:23,463
I've got to go
someplace after the show.

472
00:43:23,463 --> 00:43:25,024
Will you take care
of the boy till I get back?

473
00:43:25,024 --> 00:43:27,867
Of course. And, Lon, don't worry.

474
00:43:27,867 --> 00:43:30,669
He'll be sound asleep by the
time you come back for him.

475
00:43:30,669 --> 00:43:34,370
From now on he's going to
sleep at home, where he belongs.

476
00:43:40,585 --> 00:43:43,315
The last thing I want to do is to
cause you any trouble, Mr. Lait.

477
00:43:43,315 --> 00:43:47,687
But I've got my problem, and it's
the only way I know how to handle it.

478
00:43:47,687 --> 00:43:51,751
I'll be sorry to lose her,
Mr. Chaney, but I understand.

479
00:43:52,697 --> 00:43:55,097
I got a couple of kids
of my own.

480
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:28,291
Wait outside, Louisa.

481
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:29,526
Yes, ma'am.

482
00:44:35,306 --> 00:44:37,331
Afraid she can't
see you now, Mr. Darrow.

483
00:44:37,331 --> 00:44:39,308
Louisa, have you
no romance in your soul?

484
00:44:39,308 --> 00:44:42,540
Must you spend your entire
life keeping us apart?

485
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:44,240
Excuse me.

486
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,374
I'll just be
a few minutes, Bill.

487
00:44:46,374 --> 00:44:50,147
I thought you might need these.
The others are an hour old.

488
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:53,848
I'll wait outside.

489
00:44:53,848 --> 00:44:55,517
Oh, no. No, please, Bill.

490
00:44:55,517 --> 00:44:57,686
I'll join you at the table.

491
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:08,335
Bill, huh?

492
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:11,432
He's an important customer.

493
00:45:11,432 --> 00:45:12,703
Evidently.

494
00:45:13,144 --> 00:45:15,772
Get your things. We're picking
up Creighton at the theater.

495
00:45:15,772 --> 00:45:18,212
I'm not through. I've
got another number to do.

496
00:45:18,212 --> 00:45:21,046
You're off the payroll.
You've been replaced.

497
00:45:21,046 --> 00:45:23,882
What are you talking about?
I went over big tonight.

498
00:45:23,882 --> 00:45:26,685
Maybe this won't interest you, but
while you were going over so big,

499
00:45:26,685 --> 00:45:29,521
your son was lying sick
in a theater dressing room.

500
00:45:29,521 --> 00:45:32,791
What is it? Did you get a doctor? No.

501
00:45:32,791 --> 00:45:35,127
He doesn't need a doctor.
He needs his mother.

502
00:45:35,127 --> 00:45:37,224
Someone to see to it he eats the
right food, at the right time,

503
00:45:37,224 --> 00:45:39,929
at the right place,
in his home.

504
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,235
I've got a cab waiting.

505
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:48,074
You had me fired.

506
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:53,976
Damn you! Damn you! Damn you!

507
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:02,985
What's the trouble, Cleva?

508
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:07,757
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

509
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:14,393
I'm from the collection agency.
I've come to collect my wife.

510
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:40,559
Please.
No.

511
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:41,893
Please, Carl!
No.

512
00:46:41,893 --> 00:46:43,957
I've told you why I was late.
You're lying to me!

513
00:46:43,957 --> 00:46:46,060
I couldn't leave the boy.

514
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,161
No, you're lying to me.

515
00:46:47,161 --> 00:46:48,500
You were waiting for him,
weren't you?

516
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,664
I wasn't. I swear it.

517
00:46:49,664 --> 00:46:51,970
Carl, let...
Please let me go!

518
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:53,271
Lon, no! Don't!

519
00:46:53,271 --> 00:46:55,278
Get up! Get up!

520
00:46:56,347 --> 00:46:58,440
He's brave.
Fights for you.

521
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:01,651
Can't be just because
you take care of his kid.

522
00:47:01,651 --> 00:47:03,880
Get up!
Lon, he... He can't.

523
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:08,486
Stand me up, brave man. Stand
me up and knock me down again.

524
00:47:16,267 --> 00:47:17,962
I'm sorry.

525
00:47:17,962 --> 00:47:19,866
Don't let it keep you
awake, brave man.

526
00:47:20,204 --> 00:47:23,332
I'm trying to apologize.
Don't make it harder for me.

527
00:47:23,332 --> 00:47:25,568
Why should I make it easier?

528
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,841
I'll go get Creighton.

529
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:09,383
I'm sorry.

530
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:13,646
You couldn't have known.

531
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:15,289
Who is he?

532
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:17,984
Carl Hastings.

533
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:21,164
I was once married to him.

534
00:48:22,433 --> 00:48:24,298
It was over years ago.

535
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:27,294
I heard about his accident.
I went to see him.

536
00:48:27,294 --> 00:48:29,498
I thought maybe
I could help,

537
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:33,903
but he's become
so bitter, so cruel.

538
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:39,311
Now he wants me to go back to
him, but I can't. I just can't.

539
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:48,614
Is this why you
wanted me home, Lon?

540
00:48:48,614 --> 00:48:50,353
Was the boy
getting in your way?

541
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:52,123
Keep quiet.

542
00:48:52,123 --> 00:48:53,959
Don't bother
to introduce me.

543
00:48:53,959 --> 00:48:56,192
I'm sure this
must be Hazel.

544
00:48:57,134 --> 00:49:00,592
My son knows your name almost
as well as he knows mine.

545
00:49:01,572 --> 00:49:03,130
Are you finished, Cleva?

546
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:06,335
You and I haven't been
very bright, Mrs. Chaney.

547
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:10,075
Yes, I've finished.
For good!

548
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,344
I'm not going back
to being a nursemaid

549
00:49:13,344 --> 00:49:16,250
so you can play around
with a chorus girl!

550
00:49:37,942 --> 00:49:40,410
It's all right, Lon.
I'll be all right.

551
00:49:49,553 --> 00:49:53,353
Goodbye, Hazel.
Yeah. Goodbye.

552
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,384
What's the use?

553
00:49:58,262 --> 00:50:00,526
You're in love with him,
aren't you?

554
00:50:02,066 --> 00:50:07,060
Maybe I can't walk,
but I'm not blind.

555
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:13,809
Hello, Mr. Locan.
Don.

556
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:20,309
Clarence. Heard anything?

557
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:21,544
No. Nothing.

558
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:26,881
Well?

559
00:50:27,658 --> 00:50:28,989
Three days! She's gotta be somewhere.

560
00:50:28,989 --> 00:50:30,856
She can't just disappear
off the face of the earth.

561
00:50:30,856 --> 00:50:32,953
Mr. Locan.
Telephone, please.

562
00:50:32,953 --> 00:50:34,964
That may be something.
Yeah.

563
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:28,239
Look, Harry,
do it any way you want.

564
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:34,706
You don't need to bother me with
it. Look, I give you the stuff,

565
00:52:34,706 --> 00:52:36,377
and you put it
in the paper.

566
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:50,589
Don't go away, sweet. I'll
be right with you, sweetheart.

567
00:53:51,028 --> 00:53:53,121
Cleva, Lon's been
going crazy.

568
00:53:53,121 --> 00:53:54,721
They love him, don't they?

569
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:57,924
Wait a minute!
What're you doing?

570
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:00,729
Cleva!

571
00:54:01,772 --> 00:54:03,103
Get that curtain down!

572
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:20,512
Well, she's out of danger,
Mr. Chaney. Thanks, Doc.

573
00:54:20,512 --> 00:54:23,890
However, the acid seriously
damaged her vocal chords.

574
00:54:25,162 --> 00:54:26,390
She won't be able to talk?

575
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:27,725
In time.

576
00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:30,666
I understand
your wife was a singer.

577
00:54:30,666 --> 00:54:31,826
Yes.

578
00:54:32,169 --> 00:54:34,296
Well, she won't be anymore.

579
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:38,203
Can I see her?

580
00:54:38,203 --> 00:54:39,674
It might be wiser
if you'd wait.

581
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:42,004
Give her a week.

582
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:54,185
It's my fault
she's in there.

583
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:56,986
I drove her to it.

584
00:54:58,195 --> 00:54:59,924
Is your name Bill?

585
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:16,843
She was trying to reach Darrow.
He didn't want to be reached.

586
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:35,061
Gimme a chance, fellows.

587
00:55:35,061 --> 00:55:37,794
<i>I'm from the Morning Post,
Mr. Chaney. Why did she do it?</i>

588
00:55:37,794 --> 00:55:39,392
Well, give us a break...
Look, not now.

589
00:55:39,392 --> 00:55:41,232
Daddy! Daddy!
Hold it, sonny!

590
00:55:41,232 --> 00:55:42,863
Is it true you've been fired?
Leave him out of this.

591
00:55:42,863 --> 00:55:44,373
Look out!
Lon!

592
00:55:44,373 --> 00:55:47,035
You can't...
Come on, come on, fellows.

593
00:55:47,035 --> 00:55:48,941
He's upset. Let it be.
He could be more helpful.

594
00:55:48,941 --> 00:55:50,673
You got your headlines.
Why can't he be...

595
00:55:50,673 --> 00:55:52,738
Daddy, where's Mommy?

596
00:55:57,921 --> 00:56:00,788
Your mommy has to be away
for a while, Son.

597
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:04,522
She'll be home
in a few days.

598
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:09,327
Better finish your breakfast,
young man.

599
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:14,134
Thanks for taking
care of him, Hazel.

600
00:56:14,134 --> 00:56:16,536
But you know you shouldn't have come here.

601
00:56:16,536 --> 00:56:18,700
Those reporters,

602
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:21,141
I don't want to see you get
mixed up in this, you know.

603
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:24,076
Do you think
I care what they say?

604
00:56:24,076 --> 00:56:25,239
I'd better go.

605
00:56:25,239 --> 00:56:27,613
I want to be at the theater
when Kolb gets there.

606
00:56:27,613 --> 00:56:29,481
You know,
straighten things out.

607
00:56:29,481 --> 00:56:30,747
After all this?

608
00:56:31,922 --> 00:56:33,480
Forget it.

609
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:34,751
He'll take you back, Lon,

610
00:56:34,751 --> 00:56:36,190
when things quiet down.

611
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:38,694
Not a chance. Not a chance.

612
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:42,731
There isn't a manager in the country
that'll have anything to do with me,

613
00:56:42,731 --> 00:56:46,565
and I don't blame them. I got
nobody to blame but myself.

614
00:56:46,565 --> 00:56:49,902
Even Darrow. You can charge
that one up to me, too.

615
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:53,065
I'll take Cleva and
Creighton and go somewhere.

616
00:56:53,065 --> 00:56:55,668
Someplace where
nobody ever heard of us.

617
00:56:55,668 --> 00:56:59,443
Maybe we can get a fresh start
and stop hurting each other.

618
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:03,148
Well, we've got to try.
Got to. For the boy's sake.

619
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:07,182
Did you ever play Los Angeles?

620
00:57:07,182 --> 00:57:08,315
No. Oh, yeah.

621
00:57:08,315 --> 00:57:10,019
<i>One-night stand
with a Tom show.</i>

622
00:57:10,019 --> 00:57:12,391
Well, nobody
knows you there.

623
00:57:12,391 --> 00:57:14,089
What's there for me
in Los Angeles?

624
00:57:14,089 --> 00:57:16,098
Moving pictures.

625
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:18,930
What's that got to do with acting?

626
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:21,630
Well, for you,
everything. It's pantomime.

627
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:23,639
I don't know how long
they're gonna be around,

628
00:57:23,639 --> 00:57:26,471
but it'll keep you
going for a while.

629
00:57:26,471 --> 00:57:28,875
Hazel, can I have
some more milk?

630
00:57:29,146 --> 00:57:30,545
I'll get it.

631
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:41,482
Would you mind a suggestion
from your old Uncle Clarence?

632
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:44,888
Find yourself
a nice banjo player.

633
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:58,066
Now, don't forget, Son.

634
00:57:58,066 --> 00:58:01,668
Mommy'll be talking to us in whispers
for a while, and we'll go along with it.

635
00:58:01,668 --> 00:58:05,511
Make it a kind of game. Quiet
as a couple of mice, okay?

636
00:58:05,511 --> 00:58:06,674
Okay.
Again.

637
00:58:06,674 --> 00:58:08,547
Okay.
Good. Perfect!

638
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:13,719
Hello, there, Creighton.

639
00:58:13,719 --> 00:58:16,418
Not so loud,
Uncle Clarence.

640
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:17,984
Lon.

641
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:22,788
You wait here, Son.

642
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:30,497
Cleva's not here.

643
00:58:30,497 --> 00:58:32,735
What? Where is she?

644
00:58:32,735 --> 00:58:34,106
They don't know.

645
00:58:34,106 --> 00:58:35,974
Nobody saw her leave.

646
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:40,914
Lon, I think she's just running
from everything that's happened.

647
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:43,679
Hmm.

648
00:58:43,679 --> 00:58:45,483
Including her son.

649
00:58:45,483 --> 00:58:47,284
Look, give her
a little time, Lon.

650
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:49,519
Let her try
and work it out.

651
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:50,753
No, no.

652
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:54,257
She's run out on him
for the last time.

653
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:57,466
So help me.
So help me!

654
00:58:57,466 --> 00:59:01,664
As I stand here, she'll
never get near him again!

655
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:12,440
In view of the testimony
and the default of defendant,

656
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:16,509
Cleva Creighton Chaney, the court
grants to the plaintiff, Chaney,

657
00:59:16,509 --> 00:59:18,110
a decree of divorce.

658
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:23,492
In the matter of the custody
of Creighton Chaney,

659
00:59:23,492 --> 00:59:26,085
it is the opinion of the court
that the plaintiff, Chaney,

660
00:59:26,085 --> 00:59:30,964
is unable at this time to give the boy
the environment of a normal home life.

661
00:59:30,964 --> 00:59:32,501
Your Honor!

662
00:59:32,501 --> 00:59:34,036
Mr. Chaney,

663
00:59:34,036 --> 00:59:38,370
the court suggests that you agree
to place your son in a foster home

664
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:40,467
until you've...
No! No!

665
00:59:40,467 --> 00:59:42,603
Then this court must declare Creighton Chaney

666
00:59:42,603 --> 00:59:46,877
a ward of the court until
such time as you can prove

667
00:59:46,877 --> 00:59:49,180
permanent,
gainful employment,

668
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:53,052
the establishment of a suitable
home, proper associations...

669
00:59:53,052 --> 00:59:55,785
Why didn't you tell me
this could happen? Why? Why?

670
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:06,964
He's a good eater, and I
always get his breakfast.

671
01:00:06,964 --> 01:00:08,629
He doesn't like oatmeal,
but any other cereal...

672
01:00:08,629 --> 01:00:11,003
We set a good table,
Mr. Chaney.

673
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:29,623
You'll have lots of fun here, Son.
All those children to play with,

674
01:00:30,227 --> 01:00:34,391
and the toys and the swings.
You be a good boy, huh?

675
01:00:34,391 --> 01:00:38,560
You know, I'll come to see
you every week, every week.

676
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,365
And it won't be
for long, Son.

677
01:00:41,365 --> 01:00:44,373
I promise you,
it won't be for long.

678
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,296
Hold it there, fella.

679
01:01:16,507 --> 01:01:19,806
I been telling you,
you've got to have a pass.

680
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:22,972
And I've been asking you,
how do I get one?

681
01:01:22,972 --> 01:01:25,481
Go to the front office
and get someone to okay it.

682
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:27,779
Look, I don't want to
steal any cameras.

683
01:01:28,118 --> 01:01:30,552
All I want is somebody
to look at this press book.

684
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:33,118
I looked at it,
and I'll tell you again.

685
01:01:33,691 --> 01:01:35,989
Go over to the bullpen.
Maybe you might get lucky.

686
01:01:35,989 --> 01:01:37,618
But I'm not an extra.
I'm an actor.

687
01:01:37,618 --> 01:01:39,925
Now, aren't we all?
Aren't we all?

688
01:01:40,264 --> 01:01:41,629
Hi, Gert.
Hi.

689
01:01:42,066 --> 01:01:43,533
How's life
among the 400?

690
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,829
Ha! We're down to 399.

691
01:01:45,829 --> 01:01:46,892
I just shot my husband.

692
01:01:48,906 --> 01:01:50,601
Hey, hold it a minute.
Oh, Gert.

693
01:01:50,601 --> 01:01:51,868
Yeah?

694
01:01:54,778 --> 01:01:57,770
Set this fella straight, will
you? He says he's an actor

695
01:01:57,770 --> 01:02:00,009
but doesn't want
any part of extra work.

696
01:02:00,009 --> 01:02:01,381
An actor?

697
01:02:01,381 --> 01:02:04,020
Well! That's
a novelty around here.

698
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:05,112
Hey, come here.

699
01:02:07,091 --> 01:02:08,820
Tell him the
facts of life, huh?

700
01:02:09,126 --> 01:02:12,653
Come along, friend. I'll even look
at your press book, if you insist.

701
01:02:12,653 --> 01:02:13,754
Come on.

702
01:02:17,367 --> 01:02:18,493
Stage?
That's right.

703
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:21,670
Well, that don't cut
much ice in pictures.

704
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:26,072
We're selling dreams, Prince Charming,
handsome knights in shining armor.

705
01:02:26,343 --> 01:02:27,867
You mean
I'm not the type?

706
01:02:27,867 --> 01:02:30,243
You want it straight,
honest?

707
01:02:30,481 --> 01:02:32,073
You're not any type.

708
01:02:32,073 --> 01:02:36,108
You see, you're in movies what
we call an unsaleable commodity.

709
01:02:36,887 --> 01:02:40,448
You're just a plain, ordinary
guy with a plain, ordinary face.

710
01:02:40,448 --> 01:02:42,116
Well, that's
straight and honest.

711
01:02:42,116 --> 01:02:45,593
I know a lot of plain, ordinary
guys like you working extra.

712
01:02:45,593 --> 01:02:46,651
Why don't you try it?

713
01:02:47,364 --> 01:02:48,661
It helps them eat.

714
01:02:49,533 --> 01:02:51,296
Duchess,
I just quit acting.

715
01:02:51,296 --> 01:02:52,596
Come on!

716
01:02:58,175 --> 01:03:00,200
Oh, a big day today.

717
01:03:00,544 --> 01:03:01,533
Four pictures shooting.

718
01:03:01,745 --> 01:03:03,645
Good morning, Gert.
Hi, Harry.

719
01:03:04,481 --> 01:03:06,278
Two Westerns, a sea epic...

720
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:08,211
Hi, Gert.
Hello, Pete.

721
01:03:08,752 --> 01:03:11,016
A society comedy,
that's me.

722
01:03:11,388 --> 01:03:13,413
A breath of Riverside Drive.

723
01:03:13,624 --> 01:03:15,683
All right, Indians over
here. All Indians over here.

724
01:03:15,683 --> 01:03:17,249
Stick around.
For what?

725
01:03:17,249 --> 01:03:18,487
For what?

726
01:03:18,487 --> 01:03:20,655
The assistant directors,
no less.

727
01:03:20,655 --> 01:03:22,426
Let's have all
the bald-headed fat men.

728
01:03:22,426 --> 01:03:24,160
All right,
all the Indians over here.

729
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,599
Indians, over here.

730
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:28,137
All right, society people over here.

731
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:31,402
Five men, five women
and three waiters.

732
01:03:31,675 --> 01:03:32,664
Action.

733
01:03:34,711 --> 01:03:37,009
Now you turn around,
laugh at Chaney.

734
01:03:37,009 --> 01:03:40,413
Now slowly start
to wipe your face.

735
01:03:40,413 --> 01:03:44,853
That's it. That's good. Now
reach behind you and get your pie

736
01:03:44,853 --> 01:03:47,049
and throw it at Hank.

737
01:03:47,049 --> 01:03:50,184
That's it, that's it.
Now start to wiping your face.

738
01:03:50,184 --> 01:03:51,420
Get your pie, now,

739
01:03:52,029 --> 01:03:54,930
and pick it up
and throw it at Snub!

740
01:03:55,265 --> 01:03:56,789
That's it. That's good.

741
01:03:56,789 --> 01:03:59,994
Now, Snub, start to wipe
your face. That's it. Cut!

742
01:03:59,994 --> 01:04:02,766
That's it. Listen, please, come
on, let's move on to the next set.

743
01:04:02,766 --> 01:04:05,138
Come on, strike that set.
Come on.

744
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,519
Okay, the rest of you,
come on!

745
01:04:21,792 --> 01:04:23,384
Oh, I'm sorry, Lon.

746
01:04:23,994 --> 01:04:27,896
Well! Always did like chocolate,
Gert. Always liked chocolate.

747
01:04:28,966 --> 01:04:30,900
Oh, and Gert, thanks.

748
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,025
Oh, forget it.
No, I mean it.

749
01:04:33,025 --> 01:04:36,402
Just before I was so deliciously
blinded by this chocolate pie,

750
01:04:36,402 --> 01:04:37,735
I saw something!

751
01:04:38,775 --> 01:04:41,175
If a guy can be enough things in
this business, he can make a living.

752
01:04:41,175 --> 01:04:45,213
Now, listen. Don't start spending
the money. You've still got that face.

753
01:04:45,449 --> 01:04:48,850
I've got a box full of faces,
Gert. A whole box full!

754
01:04:56,693 --> 01:04:58,388
Morning, Duchess.
Oh, morning, Lon.

755
01:04:58,595 --> 01:05:00,358
Did you finish your bit
at Mack Sennett's?

756
01:05:00,358 --> 01:05:01,419
6:00 this morning.

757
01:05:01,419 --> 01:05:03,966
Good heavens!
Don't you ever sleep?

758
01:05:04,635 --> 01:05:08,366
Nine cowboys, four Indians,
twelve Arab horsemen,

759
01:05:08,605 --> 01:05:12,097
four lascars, two with scars, two dowagers.

760
01:05:16,146 --> 01:05:17,704
No Chinese!

761
01:05:18,548 --> 01:05:20,277
Four lascars,
two with scars.

762
01:05:20,751 --> 01:05:22,412
Lascars? What's that?

763
01:05:22,412 --> 01:05:24,282
East Indian sailors. Me!

764
01:06:04,795 --> 01:06:06,262
Makeup?

765
01:06:06,262 --> 01:06:07,524
Makeup.

766
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:14,494
What's driving you, Lon?

767
01:06:15,239 --> 01:06:17,935
You're getting bits now,
even billing once in a while.

768
01:06:18,976 --> 01:06:21,342
Why do you knock
yourself out working extra?

769
01:06:22,746 --> 01:06:25,442
Need the money, Gert.
I need the money.

770
01:06:26,083 --> 01:06:27,812
Trying to get my kid
out of hock.

771
01:06:39,663 --> 01:06:46,227
All right, you,
you, you and you.

772
01:06:47,771 --> 01:06:49,864
Oh, and you.

773
01:06:50,174 --> 01:06:52,870
I want that scar.
Report to wardrobe.

774
01:06:56,947 --> 01:06:58,676
Hey, what's your
name, fella?

775
01:06:59,216 --> 01:07:01,150
Lon Chaney.
Chaney.

776
01:07:03,453 --> 01:07:05,921
What're you trying to do? Be
a one-man crew on this ship?

777
01:07:05,921 --> 01:07:09,356
You heard him, Joe. He'll
be looking for this scar.

778
01:07:25,175 --> 01:07:26,472
Hey, you.

779
01:07:27,411 --> 01:07:28,400
Yes, please?

780
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,946
I'm looking for
a fellow called Chaney.

781
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:33,178
Talk slow, please.

782
01:07:33,417 --> 01:07:38,320
Me lookum Chaney, Lon
Chaney. Him actor, actor.

783
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:41,118
Oh, him actor.
Oh, yeah. Sahib Chaney.

784
01:07:41,118 --> 01:07:43,226
Yeah. You know where he is?
Oh, yes, yes.

785
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:46,125
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Him, him hide.

786
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:49,627
Him hear crazy Uncle Clarence
come after him, borrow money.

787
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:52,232
Well, Lon! You!

788
01:07:52,903 --> 01:07:54,803
Hello, Clarence.
You look great.

789
01:07:54,803 --> 01:07:58,205
Yeah. Yeah. You, too.
What am I saying?

790
01:07:58,205 --> 01:07:59,799
Oh, did you get that job
you wrote me about?

791
01:07:59,799 --> 01:08:02,710
You're looking at George Loane
Tucker's new public relations man.

792
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:04,781
That's movie talk
for press agent.

793
01:08:04,781 --> 01:08:06,577
Hey, that's big stuff.
You know him?

794
01:08:06,577 --> 01:08:08,117
No, could never get
my foot in the door.

795
01:08:08,117 --> 01:08:09,412
Well, I've got the key.

796
01:08:09,412 --> 01:08:11,818
<i>Tucker's ready to start a
picture called The Miracle Man.</i>

797
01:08:11,818 --> 01:08:14,824
There's only one problem.
There's a part that he can't cast,

798
01:08:15,158 --> 01:08:17,092
a very special
kind of part.

799
01:08:17,461 --> 01:08:18,723
You wouldn't happen
to know an actor

800
01:08:18,723 --> 01:08:21,320
who can twist his body
to look completely deformed,

801
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:23,992
and then unwind
before your very eyes?

802
01:08:23,992 --> 01:08:25,898
I knew him once,
Sahib Chaney.

803
01:08:26,203 --> 01:08:27,602
You're getting the drift.

804
01:08:27,838 --> 01:08:29,328
<i>Did it once in The Mikado
when he was a kid.</i>

805
01:08:29,328 --> 01:08:31,397
Only half did it. This is
going to be much tougher.

806
01:08:31,397 --> 01:08:33,065
Tucker wants to see
you tomorrow.

807
01:08:33,644 --> 01:08:35,168
Oh, no. Make it
day after tomorrow.

808
01:08:35,168 --> 01:08:36,837
Oh, it's too late.
I promised him.

809
01:08:36,837 --> 01:08:39,178
No. Tomorrow's the
day I visit with my boy.

810
01:08:39,516 --> 01:08:42,417
Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay.
The next day. I'll fix it.

811
01:08:42,417 --> 01:08:44,545
All right, on the set,
folks. Let's go. On the set.

812
01:08:44,545 --> 01:08:45,781
Stick around while I pick up the room rent.

813
01:08:45,781 --> 01:08:47,915
Everybody on the set.
Come on. Let's go!

814
01:08:50,294 --> 01:08:53,593
The beggar and the miracle man are
part of the same gang of con men.

815
01:08:53,593 --> 01:08:55,325
Isn't that right, Mr. Tucker?
That's right.

816
01:08:55,325 --> 01:08:57,629
Now, this is the
snapper of the picture.

817
01:08:57,629 --> 01:09:01,034
The phony miracle man is healing
Chaney in front of the townspeople.

818
01:09:01,338 --> 01:09:03,932
Chaney. Is it the same one
who was with Kolb and Dill?

819
01:09:03,932 --> 01:09:07,272
Oh, a long time ago. He's made
hundreds of pictures since.

820
01:09:07,577 --> 01:09:09,568
Ready, Mr. Tucker.
Okay. Excuse me, please.

821
01:09:09,568 --> 01:09:11,443
Places, everybody.

822
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:15,644
Are you sure you feel
all right, Lon?

823
01:09:15,644 --> 01:09:16,947
Yes.

824
01:09:16,947 --> 01:09:18,282
Shall we try one, Lon?

825
01:09:18,282 --> 01:09:19,413
Please.

826
01:09:24,861 --> 01:09:25,850
Camera!

827
01:09:29,366 --> 01:09:30,458
Action!

828
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:51,464
Cut!

829
01:11:52,175 --> 01:11:54,143
That was wonderful!
Perfect, Lon.

830
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:56,736
Great, Lon.
I hurt all over. Great!

831
01:12:02,552 --> 01:12:06,215
All right. All right. Ease out of
it. Let's not be so frisky, huh?

832
01:12:06,215 --> 01:12:08,120
All right, folks.
Let's break it up!

833
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:10,159
Let's get ready
for the next set-up.

834
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:12,491
Say, Lon, there's a freelance
magazine writer over there.

835
01:12:12,491 --> 01:12:14,894
He's doing a story on the
picture. He wants to meet you.

836
01:12:14,894 --> 01:12:16,660
Dave Anderson,
this is Lon Chaney.

837
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:18,496
It was really something,
Mr. Chaney.

838
01:12:18,802 --> 01:12:20,929
Were you ever a professional contortionist?

839
01:12:20,929 --> 01:12:22,631
No, just slack ligaments.

840
01:12:23,006 --> 01:12:25,873
Oh, and Dr. Shiels is on the
set in case they tighten up?

841
01:12:26,209 --> 01:12:29,645
Oh, he's the studio's idea, but he's a
good friend. I enjoy having him around.

842
01:12:29,645 --> 01:12:32,773
Hey, tell me, you were married
to Cleva Creighton, weren't you?

843
01:12:36,686 --> 01:12:38,586
<i>What has that got to do with
The Miracle Man?</i>

844
01:12:38,586 --> 01:12:41,349
Just asking, Mr. Chaney. You
had a son, too, didn't you?

845
01:12:45,662 --> 01:12:46,822
Lon!

846
01:12:55,872 --> 01:12:57,100
Come on, come on,
simmer down.

847
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:59,404
I get it all figured,
all figured.

848
01:12:59,404 --> 01:13:01,568
I make the grade,
I get my son back.

849
01:13:01,811 --> 01:13:06,077
Now this guy comes along and digs up the
whole mess, and what chance have I got?

850
01:13:06,917 --> 01:13:08,646
What happened out there?

851
01:13:09,286 --> 01:13:11,413
No more interviews,
no more questions.

852
01:13:11,413 --> 01:13:14,548
Another newspaperman
comes on the set, I go off!

853
01:13:16,459 --> 01:13:19,121
Look, Lon, publicity
is part of our business.

854
01:13:19,763 --> 01:13:23,290
We're not just a goldfish
bowl, we're a whole aquarium.

855
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,662
There's no room in the
industry for a mystery man.

856
01:13:27,003 --> 01:13:29,369
Why, if we were to...
Just a minute, Mr. Tucker.

857
01:13:29,706 --> 01:13:31,071
"Mystery man!"

858
01:13:31,541 --> 01:13:34,203
I'm a deadhead from way back. I
haven't paid to see anything in years,

859
01:13:34,203 --> 01:13:35,710
but you know something?

860
01:13:35,710 --> 01:13:37,838
I'd buy a ticket
to see a mystery man.

861
01:13:38,515 --> 01:13:40,483
A change of face,
nothing more.

862
01:13:41,284 --> 01:13:43,081
I can hear the jingle
in the box office.

863
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,750
I can see
the whole campaign now.

864
01:13:46,256 --> 01:13:49,521
"Lon Chaney,
man of mystery!"

865
01:13:51,528 --> 01:13:53,189
"Man of mystery"?

866
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,488
What do you
think of it, Lon?

867
01:13:55,488 --> 01:13:58,361
And what happens with that guy out
there with his hot little scoop?

868
01:13:58,361 --> 01:14:00,868
Oh, him? He just quit
the magazine business.

869
01:14:00,868 --> 01:14:01,993
What?

870
01:14:02,372 --> 01:14:05,967
Oh! I meant to tell you
before, he's on your payroll.

871
01:14:06,409 --> 01:14:09,310
My new assistant.
He likes to eat steady.

872
01:14:16,419 --> 01:14:18,011
What does
that judge want?

873
01:14:18,011 --> 01:14:22,354
I thought showing him this would be the
clincher, but the answer's still "no. "

874
01:14:22,892 --> 01:14:26,453
"The only concern of the court, Mr.
Chaney, is the welfare of your son. "

875
01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:29,728
What does he call permanent
employment and a suitable home?

876
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:31,863
For months now
I've been working steady.

877
01:14:31,863 --> 01:14:34,096
And this house that I bought
is not exactly a pup-tent!

878
01:14:34,096 --> 01:14:35,762
You don't have to sell me.

879
01:14:36,206 --> 01:14:39,607
His own room, a back garden,
school two blocks away,

880
01:14:39,843 --> 01:14:43,836
and a summer place that starts
going up the day I get him back.

881
01:14:44,714 --> 01:14:48,616
Just for the two of us,
where we can fish and talk

882
01:14:48,616 --> 01:14:49,947
and get to know
each other again.

883
01:14:50,253 --> 01:14:51,311
Take it easy!

884
01:14:51,855 --> 01:14:55,291
Take it easy! Take it easy!
You sound like that judge!

885
01:14:55,692 --> 01:14:58,661
Look, Lon, you never can tell. Whenever
you least expect it, it might break.

886
01:14:58,661 --> 01:14:59,854
Yeah. Yeah.

887
01:15:02,532 --> 01:15:05,660
Oh, Lon, I forgot to tell you.
I asked a girl to stop by.

888
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:08,795
I should have mentioned it
before, hope you don't mind.

889
01:15:09,873 --> 01:15:13,639
Well, if you think it's a suitable
home to bring a girl to, why, go ahead.

890
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:15,873
It's all right.
I'll go catch a movie.

891
01:15:15,873 --> 01:15:18,914
Oh, no, no.
No, it's nothing like that.

892
01:15:25,188 --> 01:15:26,780
Hello, Lon.

893
01:15:33,963 --> 01:15:38,332
About that movie, it sounds
great. Think I'll catch it.

894
01:15:47,377 --> 01:15:48,366
Hello, Hazel.

895
01:15:49,312 --> 01:15:51,303
Come in. Sit down.

896
01:15:58,221 --> 01:16:00,018
Can I get you something?

897
01:16:00,018 --> 01:16:01,148
No.

898
01:16:05,895 --> 01:16:08,887
Oh, that Locan!

899
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:12,898
Same old Uncle Clarence.
He hasn't changed a bit.

900
01:16:14,104 --> 01:16:16,538
Neither have you.
I don't know how you do it.

901
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:18,473
It's been a long time.

902
01:16:18,473 --> 01:16:19,667
Three years.

903
01:16:19,943 --> 01:16:20,932
You still dancing?

904
01:16:20,932 --> 01:16:22,875
Well, that's what
they pay me for.

905
01:16:22,875 --> 01:16:26,109
I'm on tour now. A revue. We open
tomorrow night at the Criterion.

906
01:16:26,516 --> 01:16:29,246
Well, I'll have to
catch that.

907
01:16:31,287 --> 01:16:33,778
Sure I can't
get you something?

908
01:16:33,778 --> 01:16:35,256
Oh, no. Thank you.

909
01:16:39,996 --> 01:16:42,931
You're doing wonderfully well,
Lon. I've seen a lot of your movies.

910
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:46,259
Well, you know, I grew up
on stories without words.

911
01:16:47,704 --> 01:16:50,298
In Pittsburgh I sat down
and wrote you a fan letter.

912
01:16:51,441 --> 01:16:52,703
I didn't get it.

913
01:16:52,703 --> 01:16:54,107
I didn't send it.

914
01:16:54,107 --> 01:16:56,441
Oh, that's too bad.
Could have used it.

915
01:16:57,580 --> 01:17:01,812
You know, the kind of fellows I
play, pretty girls don't write to.

916
01:17:03,987 --> 01:17:04,976
How's Creighton?

917
01:17:06,723 --> 01:17:08,884
Well, fine.
Out in the Valley.

918
01:17:09,592 --> 01:17:11,560
Yes, I know.
Locan told me.

919
01:17:14,697 --> 01:17:18,758
Would you like to see him some
afternoon? He always had a crush on you.

920
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:20,159
I'd love to.

921
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:21,760
I'll take you.

922
01:17:23,006 --> 01:17:25,065
They're very kind to fathers.

923
01:17:25,875 --> 01:17:27,740
Regular visiting hours.

924
01:17:27,977 --> 01:17:29,035
You'll get him back, Lon.

925
01:17:29,035 --> 01:17:30,272
Oh, sure.

926
01:17:31,481 --> 01:17:33,506
I've got it all worked out.

927
01:17:34,451 --> 01:17:36,646
I'm gonna buy
Buckingham Palace,

928
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:41,022
lay out a polo field in front, move in
the Taj Mahal in back for a swimming pool,

929
01:17:41,022 --> 01:17:44,525
and then maybe the court'll
rule that's a suitable home.

930
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:47,595
Oh, I'm sorry, Hazel.

931
01:17:48,798 --> 01:17:50,823
I've been in a rut lately.

932
01:17:52,001 --> 01:17:53,764
Lon. Maybe...

933
01:17:54,804 --> 01:17:55,793
What?

934
01:17:56,473 --> 01:17:58,134
I was just thinking...

935
01:17:59,008 --> 01:17:59,997
Come on.

936
01:18:01,411 --> 01:18:06,314
Maybe a suitable home doesn't
mean just a house and furniture.

937
01:18:07,317 --> 01:18:10,980
I mean, maybe the judge
feels that a suitable home is,

938
01:18:11,921 --> 01:18:14,321
well, people.

939
01:18:15,592 --> 01:18:17,992
A father, a mother,

940
01:18:19,863 --> 01:18:22,127
you know, people.

941
01:18:25,101 --> 01:18:28,764
Tell you what. Tomorrow on the
extras call sheet, I'm going to put,

942
01:18:28,764 --> 01:18:32,069
"Wanted, one mother type,
preferably under 50,

943
01:18:32,069 --> 01:18:34,939
"to fall in love
with actor and son. "

944
01:18:36,246 --> 01:18:37,611
I'm under 50, Lon.

945
01:18:41,651 --> 01:18:45,485
You said yourself Creighton's stuck
on me. That's one of you, anyway.

946
01:18:47,824 --> 01:18:49,621
You'd do that for me, Hazel?

947
01:18:49,621 --> 01:18:51,091
For myself, Lon.

948
01:18:52,795 --> 01:18:55,025
I guess I've always
been in love with you.

949
01:18:55,932 --> 01:19:00,335
Oh, Hazel. Hazel, I
wouldn't wish me on anybody.

950
01:19:02,438 --> 01:19:05,532
Well, I'm willing to take
my chances, if you want me.

951
01:19:05,532 --> 01:19:08,406
But I'm tough to get along with. Ask anybody.

952
01:19:08,978 --> 01:19:10,946
I don't know why I am,
but I am.

953
01:19:10,946 --> 01:19:13,676
That's the way it is.
Ask Locan.

954
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:15,141
I did.

955
01:19:18,922 --> 01:19:21,186
Oh, well. Locan.

956
01:19:23,826 --> 01:19:26,727
Well, anyway, that's what I was thinking.

957
01:19:28,131 --> 01:19:30,224
I'll have to
add another room.

958
01:19:34,504 --> 01:19:36,438
Would it be so difficult?

959
01:19:37,006 --> 01:19:39,839
Two truckloads of rock and
a couple of crushed fingers.

960
01:19:47,684 --> 01:19:49,709
Oh, that Locan!

961
01:20:01,564 --> 01:20:03,657
Well, well, well,
well, well!

962
01:20:06,102 --> 01:20:07,262
What do you think
of this one, boy?

963
01:20:07,262 --> 01:20:08,827
That's a beaut!

964
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:12,599
Well, yeah.

965
01:20:14,277 --> 01:20:15,505
Like him, huh?

966
01:20:16,946 --> 01:20:18,004
Got one on there?

967
01:20:18,004 --> 01:20:19,309
Lon, there's still
no sign of them.

968
01:20:19,309 --> 01:20:20,872
You suppose
anything's happened?

969
01:20:20,872 --> 01:20:21,974
Huh?

970
01:20:21,974 --> 01:20:23,951
Oh, don't worry.
They'll be here.

971
01:20:24,721 --> 01:20:28,623
Gosh, Hazel. I had a whopper
nibbling. You scared it away.

972
01:20:28,891 --> 01:20:32,418
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Creighton.
I'll try to remember next time.

973
01:20:32,418 --> 01:20:37,464
It's okay, I guess. But, you
see, trouts is very nervous.

974
01:20:40,536 --> 01:20:47,339
She's your mother now.
Why not call her that?

975
01:20:47,339 --> 01:20:48,468
I forgot.

976
01:20:48,468 --> 01:20:50,307
All right, you two.
What's going on?

977
01:20:50,307 --> 01:20:53,110
Can't men talk about men's
business without women butting in?

978
01:20:53,483 --> 01:20:54,283
Call her "Mom. "

979
01:20:58,855 --> 01:21:01,983
That'll be fun.

980
01:21:01,983 --> 01:21:05,118
Cleaning the fish is my job,
Mom. I better get started.

981
01:21:12,735 --> 01:21:14,703
Hey, this dock's
not very clean.

982
01:21:15,838 --> 01:21:17,430
What were you two
talking about?

983
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:19,567
He's getting pretty
good at it, isn't he?

984
01:21:19,567 --> 01:21:21,906
Did you tell him
to call me "Mom"?

985
01:21:22,412 --> 01:21:24,073
Do you think
that was wise?

986
01:21:24,073 --> 01:21:26,240
Isn't it a better idea...
He thinks she's dead.

987
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:28,510
It's best that way.

988
01:21:31,654 --> 01:21:34,282
Here they are!
Here they are!

989
01:21:58,648 --> 01:22:01,879
Grandma,
I'm glad to meet you.

990
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:05,654
And I'm glad to meet you.

991
01:22:07,423 --> 01:22:08,412
You've grown.

992
01:22:08,412 --> 01:22:10,755
And I'm strong, too.

993
01:22:18,034 --> 01:22:20,195
I'm glad you came.

994
01:22:21,804 --> 01:22:24,102
Well! Clarence,
how are you?

995
01:22:24,102 --> 01:22:25,162
Lon, how are you?

996
01:22:25,162 --> 01:22:26,208
Papa!

997
01:22:27,744 --> 01:22:30,042
Yeah, sure lots of
kissing going on around here.

998
01:22:30,042 --> 01:22:32,638
Don't look at me.
Thanks for bringing them up.

999
01:22:32,638 --> 01:22:36,082
No trouble at all. I always wanted
to know what "nowhere" looks like.

1000
01:22:36,819 --> 01:22:38,286
What's that?
That is a script.

1001
01:22:39,655 --> 01:22:43,113
Oh, no. This is vacation. Not
allowed to read. My wife won't let me.

1002
01:22:56,672 --> 01:22:58,697
You beat me again.

1003
01:22:58,697 --> 01:23:01,539
I'm becoming expert.

1004
01:23:19,562 --> 01:23:20,688
You all right, Lon?

1005
01:23:20,688 --> 01:23:22,458
Oh, just couldn't
sleep, that's all.

1006
01:23:24,534 --> 01:23:25,967
What have you been doing?

1007
01:23:25,967 --> 01:23:27,693
Just sketching up
an idea I had.

1008
01:23:27,693 --> 01:23:29,328
Oh, may I see it?

1009
01:23:42,418 --> 01:23:43,817
Is it a good script?

1010
01:23:43,817 --> 01:23:45,615
Doesn't matter.
Not gonna do it.

1011
01:23:46,289 --> 01:23:48,484
Why? Because
it might remind us?

1012
01:23:48,958 --> 01:23:52,894
Oh, Lon, do it, if it's a good
script. The past can't hurt us.

1013
01:24:25,461 --> 01:24:27,725
And send a copy of the
novel to the New York office.

1014
01:24:27,725 --> 01:24:29,526
No, better not. It'll take
them a year to read it.

1015
01:24:29,765 --> 01:24:31,858
Send them a one-page synopsis, short words.

1016
01:24:31,858 --> 01:24:33,526
All right, I will.

1017
01:24:34,003 --> 01:24:36,164
I'm Lon Chaney. I've got an
appointment with Mr. Thalberg.

1018
01:24:36,164 --> 01:24:38,230
Oh, right in there,
Mr. Chaney.

1019
01:24:48,751 --> 01:24:50,480
Please sit down,
Mr. Chaney.

1020
01:24:57,193 --> 01:24:58,922
Mr. Thalberg?
Don't let it bother you.

1021
01:24:58,922 --> 01:25:00,963
It happens all the time.

1022
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,999
Did you read the book?

1023
01:25:05,999 --> 01:25:07,626
One sitting.
Couldn't put it down.

1024
01:25:07,626 --> 01:25:09,830
That's the way it hit me the first time, too.

1025
01:25:10,106 --> 01:25:13,872
You see, when I was a boy, I was sick
quite a bit. They made me stay in bed.

1026
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:18,537
I had nothing better to do, so I read
every book I could lay my hands on.

1027
01:25:18,537 --> 01:25:21,777
<i>I'll never forget the first day I
read The Hunchback of Notre Dame.</i>

1028
01:25:22,251 --> 01:25:24,879
Sent my temperature
sky high. Now...

1029
01:25:26,022 --> 01:25:27,887
Now I want to make it
into a picture.

1030
01:25:28,758 --> 01:25:32,125
And you know, between you and me, this
company can use a prestige picture.

1031
01:25:32,328 --> 01:25:35,161
And I don't think anyone around would
mind if it made a couple of dollars, too.

1032
01:25:35,161 --> 01:25:36,289
Oh, naturally.

1033
01:25:36,289 --> 01:25:38,595
The whole project scares
the New York office stiff.

1034
01:25:39,135 --> 01:25:43,128
They see it as 10 reels of sheer
horror, with a monster playing the lead.

1035
01:25:44,907 --> 01:25:47,501
Tell me, Mr. Chaney,
how do you see Quasimodo?

1036
01:25:58,321 --> 01:26:02,621
I see him as a man
deformed, cursed, tormented,

1037
01:26:04,594 --> 01:26:06,118
laughed at as a freak,

1038
01:26:06,863 --> 01:26:10,196
but his tormentors never see
the heartbreak or the tears.

1039
01:26:15,705 --> 01:26:19,038
That's just what I want the
audience to see, Mr. Chaney.

1040
01:26:20,276 --> 01:26:23,074
The soul of a man
that God made different.

1041
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:26,974
If you can get that on film,
we've got ourselves a picture!

1042
01:26:28,217 --> 01:26:30,048
Can you really make him
look like that?

1043
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:33,145
I started on the makeup
the day you sent me the book.

1044
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:41,259
<i>Do you know why I wanted you
for The Hunchback, Mr. Chaney?</i>

1045
01:26:41,898 --> 01:26:42,887
No.

1046
01:26:43,733 --> 01:26:48,170
This project is so important to me that
I couldn't take a chance on just anyone.

1047
01:26:49,005 --> 01:26:52,941
Every time an actor was suggested, I dug
into his past to see what made him tick.

1048
01:26:54,644 --> 01:26:57,807
In your case,
I dug rather deep,

1049
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:02,881
all the way back
to Colorado Springs.

1050
01:27:06,455 --> 01:27:07,547
My parents?

1051
01:27:07,547 --> 01:27:10,023
You know what it's like
to be different.

1052
01:27:10,793 --> 01:27:12,727
Make people understand.

1053
01:27:13,529 --> 01:27:15,622
Make them see it
the way you see it.

1054
01:27:30,346 --> 01:27:32,177
All right.
Now we'll try this.

1055
01:27:32,177 --> 01:27:33,772
All right.

1056
01:27:39,488 --> 01:27:41,388
Now we'll try
this one over here.

1057
01:27:46,062 --> 01:27:47,256
It's too tight, Lon.
It's too tight.

1058
01:27:47,256 --> 01:27:48,354
No, it's all right, Doc.

1059
01:27:48,354 --> 01:27:51,423
If you have it that tight, you won't
be able to wear it more than 15 minutes.

1060
01:27:51,423 --> 01:27:52,831
Let me worry about that.

1061
01:27:52,831 --> 01:27:56,565
If you're going to keep ignoring my
advice, why do you have me around?

1062
01:27:57,340 --> 01:27:58,329
You never can tell.

1063
01:27:59,675 --> 01:28:01,233
I might catch cold.

1064
01:28:08,617 --> 01:28:12,075
You talk to him, will you,
Hazel? He pays no attention to me.

1065
01:28:14,590 --> 01:28:16,455
Mom!
We're up here, dear.

1066
01:28:16,455 --> 01:28:18,322
We're going to an unveiling.

1067
01:28:19,295 --> 01:28:20,990
Hello, Doc Shiels.
Hello, Creighton.

1068
01:28:21,297 --> 01:28:22,286
Creighton!

1069
01:28:22,631 --> 01:28:25,725
All right. All right.
I'll get it later.

1070
01:28:26,068 --> 01:28:28,298
Horrifying but pitiful.

1071
01:28:28,571 --> 01:28:30,334
It's great, Lon,
just great!

1072
01:28:32,675 --> 01:28:34,040
Hi, Mom.
Hi, dear.

1073
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:35,907
Hi, Pop.
Uncle Clarence.

1074
01:28:35,907 --> 01:28:36,967
Creighton.

1075
01:28:36,967 --> 01:28:40,174
Say, Pop! There's a great
new joke going around school.

1076
01:28:40,174 --> 01:28:42,876
"Don't step on that spider,
it might be Lon Chaney. "

1077
01:28:44,220 --> 01:28:45,312
Very funny!

1078
01:28:45,588 --> 01:28:47,852
Darling, it's wonderful,
but isn't it very painful?

1079
01:28:47,852 --> 01:28:49,686
Only when I laugh.

1080
01:28:49,686 --> 01:28:51,386
What a poster
you'll make!

1081
01:29:01,237 --> 01:29:03,705
Where'd you get this? Well?

1082
01:29:04,407 --> 01:29:06,671
A lady gave it to me.

1083
01:29:07,343 --> 01:29:08,605
What lady? Where?

1084
01:29:08,811 --> 01:29:12,372
She comes around school every
week or so, watches us play ball.

1085
01:29:13,115 --> 01:29:14,912
It isn't worth
anything, is it?

1086
01:29:23,526 --> 01:29:28,395
Son, there are some drawings on the back
seat of my car. Get them for me, will you?

1087
01:29:38,474 --> 01:29:42,433
Be at that school every day until
she shows up, and bring her to me.

1088
01:29:42,711 --> 01:29:44,474
I want to see her.
See who?

1089
01:29:45,014 --> 01:29:46,003
Cleva!

1090
01:29:49,819 --> 01:29:51,377
All ready, sir.
All right.

1091
01:29:51,854 --> 01:29:52,814
Cameras!

1092
01:29:54,523 --> 01:29:56,081
Action! Bring in the cart.

1093
01:31:15,171 --> 01:31:16,195
Hold it!

1094
01:31:18,908 --> 01:31:19,897
Get me out of this!

1095
01:31:20,709 --> 01:31:22,438
Get me out of this!
There's something wrong, sir.

1096
01:31:22,438 --> 01:31:24,479
Cut! Get him out
of the shackles.

1097
01:31:29,151 --> 01:31:30,516
What's wrong, Lon?
Are you all right?

1098
01:31:30,516 --> 01:31:33,578
Oh, I'm all right.
I'm all right. I'm fine.

1099
01:31:49,171 --> 01:31:51,105
Still afraid of freaks,
Cleva?

1100
01:31:51,707 --> 01:31:54,232
That's a very
startling makeup.

1101
01:31:55,878 --> 01:31:56,936
You wanted to see me?

1102
01:31:56,936 --> 01:31:58,206
Yes. Yes.

1103
01:31:58,514 --> 01:32:00,846
How much? How much
to leave us alone?

1104
01:32:03,953 --> 01:32:04,942
Nothing, Lon.

1105
01:32:05,754 --> 01:32:07,415
I don't want
a thing from you.

1106
01:32:08,524 --> 01:32:11,891
You've done a good job of raising
him, you and Hazel. He's fine.

1107
01:32:12,428 --> 01:32:14,896
Don't give me that.
You came back for something!

1108
01:32:15,197 --> 01:32:16,926
I wanted to see him.

1109
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:21,695
Was that so terrible,
wanting to see my son again?

1110
01:32:22,171 --> 01:32:25,538
Your son? You have to care
for something to make it yours.

1111
01:32:25,538 --> 01:32:26,939
You never even wanted him!
Lon!

1112
01:32:26,939 --> 01:32:28,476
Come on! Come on!
Let's have it. How much?

1113
01:32:28,476 --> 01:32:29,602
Lon, please.

1114
01:32:29,602 --> 01:32:32,476
Don't bother.
It's no use.

1115
01:32:41,056 --> 01:32:42,182
Lon!

1116
01:32:46,428 --> 01:32:47,986
Can we go someplace
to talk?

1117
01:32:47,986 --> 01:32:49,325
You can say it here.

1118
01:32:50,699 --> 01:32:52,860
Lon, try not to be
angry with me. Please.

1119
01:32:53,669 --> 01:32:56,331
I think Creighton has a right
to know his mother's alive.

1120
01:32:56,331 --> 01:32:57,702
I don't!

1121
01:32:57,702 --> 01:32:59,536
He'll find out someday.

1122
01:33:00,175 --> 01:33:03,576
Unless he's heard it from you, he'll
hate you for it. Oh, tell him, Lon.

1123
01:33:03,576 --> 01:33:05,910
And make myself
a liar in his eyes?

1124
01:33:05,910 --> 01:33:09,314
We won't talk about it
anymore. He's not to know!

1125
01:33:44,119 --> 01:33:46,087
What's all this?
Just fooling around.

1126
01:33:46,087 --> 01:33:49,955
Oh, at four it could be fooling around.
At your age, it could be an itch.

1127
01:33:49,955 --> 01:33:51,014
Okay, Pop.

1128
01:33:51,527 --> 01:33:54,189
I've been thinking, with
two actors in the family,

1129
01:33:54,189 --> 01:33:56,663
we'd sure have this
business sewed up.

1130
01:33:57,032 --> 01:33:58,829
Two actors, huh?
Where'd you get that idea?

1131
01:33:58,829 --> 01:34:00,696
An agent talked to me
on your set.

1132
01:34:00,696 --> 01:34:04,170
He said he'd get me a good part if you'd
let him bill me as Lon Chaney, Junior.

1133
01:34:04,406 --> 01:34:06,897
Oh, Son, there's always somebody
around looking to make a fast dollar.

1134
01:34:06,897 --> 01:34:08,169
They figure they can
get one with you.

1135
01:34:08,169 --> 01:34:10,643
But he says he can
make me an actor.

1136
01:34:10,643 --> 01:34:11,702
Son,

1137
01:34:12,448 --> 01:34:14,143
to quote the great
Richard Mansfield,

1138
01:34:14,583 --> 01:34:19,077
"Actors are not made.
Actors and idiots are born. "

1139
01:34:19,588 --> 01:34:21,749
You mean you won't let me?

1140
01:34:23,025 --> 01:34:26,188
Son, I've always tried to do
what was best for you.

1141
01:34:26,188 --> 01:34:28,126
Let me go on trying
a little longer, huh?

1142
01:34:28,126 --> 01:34:31,462
Anyway, have you forgotten?
I finish my job tonight.

1143
01:34:31,767 --> 01:34:34,201
We've got a whole week at the cabin.

1144
01:34:36,305 --> 01:34:38,569
I don't want to go.

1145
01:34:44,513 --> 01:34:46,572
Creighton? Creighton.

1146
01:34:50,152 --> 01:34:51,141
What is it?

1147
01:34:52,988 --> 01:34:55,081
Oh, a crazy idea he's got.

1148
01:34:55,081 --> 01:34:56,818
Like wanting to be an actor?

1149
01:34:57,192 --> 01:34:58,386
I want more
than that for him.

1150
01:34:58,386 --> 01:35:01,691
Lon, don't hold him so
tightly. Don't smother him.

1151
01:35:01,691 --> 01:35:04,289
He loves you more
than anyone, anything.

1152
01:35:04,289 --> 01:35:06,732
You can't ask for more
than all his love.

1153
01:35:08,070 --> 01:35:09,901
Tell him I'm leaving
for the cabin tonight.

1154
01:35:09,901 --> 01:35:12,167
He can come along
or stay home, either way.

1155
01:35:20,048 --> 01:35:21,037
Action!

1156
01:37:02,017 --> 01:37:03,006
Cut!

1157
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:06,217
Very nice, dear.
Very nice.

1158
01:37:06,217 --> 01:37:07,414
Thank you, Mr. Chaney.

1159
01:37:07,414 --> 01:37:10,322
That was great, Lon. Really.
Really, just great.

1160
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:13,452
There's Hazel and Creighton.

1161
01:37:15,797 --> 01:37:18,197
Hello, Hazel, Creighton.
Thank you, Lon.

1162
01:37:19,968 --> 01:37:22,095
Oh, hello. Uncle Clarence.

1163
01:37:32,447 --> 01:37:34,881
The car's outside, Pop,
and the gear's all loaded.

1164
01:37:34,881 --> 01:37:36,850
We can go as soon as
you're ready.

1165
01:37:38,287 --> 01:37:42,280
Wonderful, Son. I've got one
more shot. I'll hurry them along!

1166
01:37:46,295 --> 01:37:49,856
It's always the same. I wind up
apologizing and doing what he wants.

1167
01:37:49,856 --> 01:37:50,921
Creighton!

1168
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:52,989
I'm sorry, Mom.

1169
01:37:52,989 --> 01:37:54,763
What started
the ruckus, anyway?

1170
01:37:55,103 --> 01:37:58,766
He caught me fooling around in his
makeup box, copying one of his faces.

1171
01:37:59,474 --> 01:38:01,942
He's got 1,000 of them,
but you should have heard him.

1172
01:38:02,311 --> 01:38:03,676
What'd you say?

1173
01:38:03,676 --> 01:38:04,734
Huh?

1174
01:38:04,734 --> 01:38:06,610
A thousand faces!

1175
01:38:07,015 --> 01:38:10,041
Thalberg's been after me to
start a new advertising campaign.

1176
01:38:10,485 --> 01:38:12,953
"The Man of a Thousand Faces!"
How's that?

1177
01:38:12,953 --> 01:38:15,148
Son, if I get a raise,
I'm gonna give you half.

1178
01:38:15,148 --> 01:38:17,418
Make it a new fishing rod.

1179
01:38:56,999 --> 01:38:59,593
What's he stalling for?
He's got six more changes yet.

1180
01:39:09,745 --> 01:39:11,610
Well, Irving.
What do you think?

1181
01:39:11,610 --> 01:39:12,738
I like it.

1182
01:39:13,115 --> 01:39:15,743
Lon, we're moving the
starting date back a week.

1183
01:39:16,284 --> 01:39:17,273
Oh?

1184
01:39:17,486 --> 01:39:19,078
And when did you
decide to do that?

1185
01:39:19,078 --> 01:39:20,621
Hazel phoned.

1186
01:39:21,957 --> 01:39:23,618
Won't upset things
too much, huh?

1187
01:39:23,859 --> 01:39:27,192
You see, it's the last chance my boy'll
have all summer to get up to the cabin.

1188
01:39:27,696 --> 01:39:29,596
I got him a job downtown
with a brokerage firm.

1189
01:39:29,596 --> 01:39:34,159
I'm afraid one of these days your
wife's gonna charm me out of my job!

1190
01:39:34,159 --> 01:39:36,295
But that's only one reason
I came down, Lon.

1191
01:39:37,005 --> 01:39:38,199
What's the other reason?

1192
01:39:38,199 --> 01:39:39,672
Your new contract.

1193
01:39:42,210 --> 01:39:45,270
Lon, we've got to sit down one
of these days and thrash it out.

1194
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:47,745
Irving! Draw it up.
I'll sign it.

1195
01:39:47,745 --> 01:39:50,751
It isn't that easy. There are
terms, clauses, conditions.

1196
01:39:50,751 --> 01:39:52,252
Listen, you know,
the fine print.

1197
01:39:53,622 --> 01:39:55,453
Can't we just shake hands
and call it a deal?

1198
01:39:55,453 --> 01:39:57,458
And how do I explain that
to the legal department?

1199
01:39:57,859 --> 01:39:59,349
Have your secretary
make out a memo.

1200
01:39:59,349 --> 01:40:01,726
"Mr. Thalberg and Mr. Chaney shook hands. "

1201
01:40:04,166 --> 01:40:05,428
Phone, Mr. Chaney.
Thanks.

1202
01:40:05,428 --> 01:40:08,867
Probably Hazel.
I better get on that memo.

1203
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:16,733
Hello, honey.

1204
01:40:17,846 --> 01:40:19,438
Almost finished here.

1205
01:40:19,438 --> 01:40:22,142
Yeah. I'll be home in
about an hour. Maybe sooner.

1206
01:40:22,142 --> 01:40:24,151
Everything packed?

1207
01:40:24,453 --> 01:40:25,852
Creighton get home yet?

1208
01:40:25,852 --> 01:40:27,013
Any minute now.

1209
01:40:30,625 --> 01:40:31,614
Yes.

1210
01:40:38,834 --> 01:40:42,964
What, Lon? Yes. Yes, dear.
All right, I will. Goodbye.

1211
01:40:46,308 --> 01:40:47,297
Cleva!

1212
01:40:49,745 --> 01:40:50,734
Cleva!

1213
01:40:56,084 --> 01:40:57,449
Please come inside.

1214
01:40:57,449 --> 01:40:58,747
Oh, no!

1215
01:40:58,747 --> 01:41:00,253
Yes. Please.

1216
01:41:00,455 --> 01:41:02,047
Do you really want me to?

1217
01:41:03,592 --> 01:41:05,992
Lon won't be home
for at least an hour.

1218
01:41:07,629 --> 01:41:09,028
He'd be very angry.

1219
01:41:09,564 --> 01:41:11,828
I know. Come in, please.

1220
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:20,800
For a long time now I've
known you were coming here.

1221
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:23,071
I've seen you there
at the end of the drive.

1222
01:41:23,071 --> 01:41:26,672
Until today I didn't have the
courage to do anything about it.

1223
01:41:37,592 --> 01:41:40,425
It's very beautiful.
Thank you.

1224
01:41:40,425 --> 01:41:42,486
Can I get you something?
Some tea? Oh, don't bother.

1225
01:41:42,486 --> 01:41:43,996
Oh, it's no bother
at all. Vera, please.

1226
01:41:43,996 --> 01:41:45,498
Yes, Mrs. Chaney.

1227
01:41:45,734 --> 01:41:47,463
Come on, sit down.

1228
01:41:58,346 --> 01:41:59,904
Do you live nearby?

1229
01:41:59,904 --> 01:42:01,642
I'm working on a farm
in the valley,

1230
01:42:02,150 --> 01:42:03,139
as a cook.

1231
01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:06,846
On my day off, I...

1232
01:42:06,846 --> 01:42:09,482
I always promise myself
I won't come here.

1233
01:42:10,759 --> 01:42:12,693
I know it can
only mean trouble.

1234
01:42:13,995 --> 01:42:16,828
I say I'll go shopping
or to the movies.

1235
01:42:19,401 --> 01:42:21,369
And here I am.

1236
01:42:24,406 --> 01:42:26,533
I haven't bothered Creighton.

1237
01:42:27,209 --> 01:42:28,198
It's just that...

1238
01:42:29,678 --> 01:42:32,112
I just have to see him
every so often.

1239
01:42:33,415 --> 01:42:35,645
I'm sure I'd do
exactly the same thing.

1240
01:42:37,419 --> 01:42:39,216
I feel so guilty about him.

1241
01:42:40,755 --> 01:42:44,122
I always have,
all these years.

1242
01:42:47,562 --> 01:42:50,190
I just didn't know
how to handle it, Hazel.

1243
01:42:50,699 --> 01:42:53,133
After what happened,
at the time, it...

1244
01:42:53,802 --> 01:42:55,292
It just seemed easier
to run away.

1245
01:42:57,272 --> 01:43:00,036
It's Creighton. Stay and
talk to him. Oh, I couldn't.

1246
01:43:00,036 --> 01:43:01,972
Oh, please.
I wouldn't know what to say.

1247
01:43:01,972 --> 01:43:03,374
I shouldn't have come in.

1248
01:43:03,645 --> 01:43:06,512
I've got to get to the
bus station, the last bus.

1249
01:43:29,804 --> 01:43:31,567
Who was that, Mom?
Anyone I know?

1250
01:43:32,507 --> 01:43:33,496
Someone you did know,

1251
01:43:34,943 --> 01:43:36,570
a long time ago.

1252
01:43:44,953 --> 01:43:45,942
Hello!

1253
01:43:47,989 --> 01:43:49,479
Where is everybody?

1254
01:43:50,959 --> 01:43:51,948
Up here, Lon.

1255
01:43:53,128 --> 01:43:54,117
Coming up!

1256
01:44:00,168 --> 01:44:02,500
I thought you'd be ready.

1257
01:44:04,172 --> 01:44:06,106
You, too? What is all this?

1258
01:44:06,641 --> 01:44:09,269
I'm not going. Something
more important came up.

1259
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:14,445
More important?
Like what?

1260
01:44:14,883 --> 01:44:17,351
It's just that I can't
go with you, that's all.

1261
01:44:17,886 --> 01:44:20,446
Well, I'd still like
a reason, Son.

1262
01:44:28,530 --> 01:44:31,499
Boy, you in some
kind of trouble?

1263
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:33,993
No, nothing like that.

1264
01:44:33,993 --> 01:44:36,831
Well, if it's that job I
got you, that's easily fixed.

1265
01:44:36,831 --> 01:44:39,237
There are other jobs.
Just say the word.

1266
01:44:39,874 --> 01:44:42,342
Look, let's forget it, huh?

1267
01:44:44,012 --> 01:44:46,981
Son, we've been
together a long time.

1268
01:44:48,616 --> 01:44:50,811
We've never had
any secrets before.

1269
01:44:51,753 --> 01:44:52,742
Haven't we?

1270
01:44:56,858 --> 01:44:58,382
What do you mean by that?

1271
01:44:59,928 --> 01:45:01,361
I'll tell you what I mean.

1272
01:45:02,230 --> 01:45:06,462
I saw her today. My mother. My real mother!

1273
01:45:07,969 --> 01:45:11,461
Why did you lie to me, Pop? Why
did you tell me she was dead?

1274
01:45:18,013 --> 01:45:20,413
Son, you've
got to understand.

1275
01:45:20,413 --> 01:45:22,277
I understand.

1276
01:45:22,484 --> 01:45:25,783
I understand you lied to me.
I understand that much!

1277
01:45:26,287 --> 01:45:28,380
She ran out on you
when you were a baby.

1278
01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:31,220
As far as we were concerned, she was
dead! I was just trying to protect you.

1279
01:45:31,559 --> 01:45:32,548
Were you, Pop?

1280
01:45:35,930 --> 01:45:36,954
Son!

1281
01:45:38,533 --> 01:45:39,522
Creighton!

1282
01:45:45,373 --> 01:45:48,501
Creighton! If you go to her,
don't bother to come back!

1283
01:46:07,695 --> 01:46:09,253
I knew it.

1284
01:46:10,265 --> 01:46:12,165
I knew she'd
take him from me.

1285
01:46:13,101 --> 01:46:15,001
I told him
who she was, Lon.

1286
01:46:18,106 --> 01:46:20,074
I couldn't lie to him
any longer.

1287
01:46:20,708 --> 01:46:23,734
He had every right to know.
Cleva had every right to see him.

1288
01:46:24,712 --> 01:46:26,839
The only harm
was in your mind.

1289
01:46:27,348 --> 01:46:28,645
He's her son, too.

1290
01:46:31,252 --> 01:46:35,313
Well, he's gone to her now.
Are you satisfied?

1291
01:46:37,392 --> 01:46:39,326
What were you
really afraid of, Lon?

1292
01:46:40,195 --> 01:46:44,154
That he'd open up his heart to
her and you'd lose part of him?

1293
01:46:44,466 --> 01:46:46,024
You wanted all of his love.

1294
01:46:46,634 --> 01:46:50,001
He had all of yours, with
nothing left over for anyone else.

1295
01:46:54,209 --> 01:46:55,574
Well!

1296
01:46:56,744 --> 01:46:57,972
I'm sorry.

1297
01:47:08,623 --> 01:47:09,817
Is Lon still around?

1298
01:47:09,817 --> 01:47:10,949
When isn't he, lately?

1299
01:47:11,259 --> 01:47:14,092
It's after midnight again.
He's in his dressing room.

1300
01:47:15,497 --> 01:47:16,486
Hey, Locan.

1301
01:47:18,133 --> 01:47:19,862
Maybe you can do
something with him.

1302
01:47:20,235 --> 01:47:22,294
He's had us working
day and night for a month.

1303
01:47:22,837 --> 01:47:25,670
Some of us have families who've
forgotten what we look like.

1304
01:47:25,907 --> 01:47:27,465
I'll do what I can.

1305
01:47:32,514 --> 01:47:33,503
Got a cold?

1306
01:47:35,216 --> 01:47:37,275
No, it's nothing.

1307
01:47:37,685 --> 01:47:39,414
Maybe you ought to
slow down.

1308
01:47:40,588 --> 01:47:43,785
You didn't come here this time
of night to ask about my health.

1309
01:47:45,426 --> 01:47:48,953
Well, Lon, I thought you'd
like to know. I found them,

1310
01:47:49,230 --> 01:47:50,754
Cleva and the boy.

1311
01:47:51,132 --> 01:47:53,657
Would you like to go see
them? I've got the address.

1312
01:47:54,335 --> 01:47:55,324
Tear it up.

1313
01:47:55,803 --> 01:47:58,829
Lon, he's just a kid. He's working like
a dog trying to support both of them...

1314
01:47:58,829 --> 01:48:00,568
He wanted it that way.

1315
01:48:01,309 --> 01:48:04,278
And who told you to go look for him,
anyway? Who asked you to interfere?

1316
01:48:04,779 --> 01:48:06,542
But, Lon, I've known
the kid since the day...

1317
01:48:06,542 --> 01:48:08,605
From now on,
stay away from him.

1318
01:48:09,050 --> 01:48:11,041
If he wants to see me,
he knows where I am.

1319
01:48:11,686 --> 01:48:15,247
He won't come to you. You'll
have to make the first move.

1320
01:48:17,425 --> 01:48:18,949
Me go to him?

1321
01:48:18,949 --> 01:48:20,722
Get down on my knees
to my own son?

1322
01:48:20,722 --> 01:48:22,854
Beg him? Is that what you're asking me to do?

1323
01:48:22,854 --> 01:48:25,092
That's exactly
what I think you should do.

1324
01:48:25,092 --> 01:48:27,157
Well, you can stop
thinking right now!

1325
01:48:27,157 --> 01:48:30,295
And you can stop
bothering me, too! Out!

1326
01:48:34,375 --> 01:48:36,900
Make it a thousand
and one faces, Lon.

1327
01:48:37,845 --> 01:48:40,507
This is one
I've never seen before.

1328
01:48:51,359 --> 01:48:53,224
Mind if I come in a minute?

1329
01:48:54,629 --> 01:48:56,221
I know I don't look dressed
for the barricades,

1330
01:48:56,221 --> 01:48:57,889
but I've just come
from a revolution.

1331
01:48:58,600 --> 01:49:00,295
<i>The premiere of
The Jazz Singer.</i>

1332
01:49:00,602 --> 01:49:02,263
Lon, you should have
seen that audience!

1333
01:49:02,670 --> 01:49:04,467
When Jolson's voice
came from the screen,

1334
01:49:04,467 --> 01:49:07,064
I could hear the bells
tolling for silent pictures.

1335
01:49:08,910 --> 01:49:10,901
You haven't heard
a word I said.

1336
01:49:12,213 --> 01:49:14,681
Oh, I'm sorry, Irving.
What were you saying?

1337
01:49:14,681 --> 01:49:15,771
Nothing much.

1338
01:49:16,651 --> 01:49:18,551
I was just trying to tell
you about a modern miracle.

1339
01:49:19,053 --> 01:49:21,487
Pictures that not only move,
Lon, but they speak.

1340
01:49:21,956 --> 01:49:23,947
Oh, yes, sure.
Talking pictures.

1341
01:49:23,947 --> 01:49:26,823
It's the horse and the automobile all
over again. No use trying to fight it.

1342
01:49:27,996 --> 01:49:32,433
I'm afraid some of the old favorites are
going to fall by the wayside, a lot of them.

1343
01:49:33,067 --> 01:49:37,060
Well, everything has to come to
an end, and I've had a long run.

1344
01:49:38,072 --> 01:49:39,539
Who said anything
about you, Lon?

1345
01:49:40,575 --> 01:49:42,338
You're going to be
bigger than ever!

1346
01:49:42,338 --> 01:49:44,378
<i>We're going to remake
The Unholy Three.</i>

1347
01:49:44,378 --> 01:49:46,003
You're still gonna play
all the different characters,

1348
01:49:46,003 --> 01:49:47,911
only this time
with voices to match.

1349
01:49:47,911 --> 01:49:49,779
A thousand voices!

1350
01:49:50,385 --> 01:49:53,912
Oh, yeah. Sure, Irving.
We'll talk about it sometime.

1351
01:49:56,824 --> 01:50:00,089
I'm sorry I had to break in on you,
Lon, but I just had to tell you.

1352
01:50:00,089 --> 01:50:02,356
That's all right.

1353
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:08,667
<i>Just remember, The Unholy Three
is yours anytime you want it, Lon.</i>

1354
01:50:09,137 --> 01:50:10,832
Thanks, Irving.
Good night, Lon.

1355
01:50:11,539 --> 01:50:12,528
Good night.

1356
01:50:16,944 --> 01:50:17,664
Quiet!

1357
01:50:20,748 --> 01:50:22,215
All set.

1358
01:50:22,215 --> 01:50:23,648
Ready, Lon?

1359
01:50:27,955 --> 01:50:28,944
Roll them.

1360
01:50:31,125 --> 01:50:32,114
Speed.

1361
01:50:35,196 --> 01:50:36,185
Action!

1362
01:50:38,499 --> 01:50:39,989
We've got nothing
to worry about.

1363
01:50:40,702 --> 01:50:43,500
This is the greatest set-up
since thievery was invented.

1364
01:50:45,306 --> 01:50:48,434
We're gonna lift every hunk of jewelry
in this town that's worth taking.

1365
01:50:48,943 --> 01:50:49,932
Cut!

1366
01:51:02,223 --> 01:51:04,214
Let's just try it once more.

1367
01:51:05,526 --> 01:51:07,687
That was the seventh take.
Now, what is it, now?

1368
01:51:08,563 --> 01:51:10,827
Sorry, Lon. Your voice
sounded a little gravelly.

1369
01:51:10,827 --> 01:51:12,092
The mike didn't
pick it all up.

1370
01:51:12,092 --> 01:51:14,394
Oh, that's great! Great!

1371
01:51:14,602 --> 01:51:16,297
We used to think
we could make pictures.

1372
01:51:16,297 --> 01:51:19,065
Lights, a camera
and some acting. Now,

1373
01:51:19,841 --> 01:51:22,867
everything is sound.
Are you noisy enough?

1374
01:51:23,111 --> 01:51:24,100
Sorry, Lon.

1375
01:51:24,100 --> 01:51:26,339
Oh, I'm sorry, Jack. Sorry.

1376
01:51:26,547 --> 01:51:28,515
Just letting off steam.

1377
01:51:32,820 --> 01:51:35,311
All right. All right. Open up.

1378
01:51:38,159 --> 01:51:39,183
What? Again?

1379
01:51:39,183 --> 01:51:40,989
Just pretend it's caviar.

1380
01:51:41,396 --> 01:51:43,364
Say "ah. "
Ah.

1381
01:51:44,065 --> 01:51:45,396
Ah.
Ah.

1382
01:51:45,396 --> 01:51:46,693
Ah.

1383
01:51:47,435 --> 01:51:48,959
Ah.
Ah.

1384
01:51:50,338 --> 01:51:51,999
Oh, Doc, you must
love tonsils,

1385
01:51:52,707 --> 01:51:54,834
the way you keep looking at
mine every chance you get.

1386
01:51:54,834 --> 01:51:57,377
Well, this picture ends tonight.
And tonight you go to the hospital.

1387
01:51:57,678 --> 01:51:59,509
This time there's
no point arguing.

1388
01:51:59,914 --> 01:52:02,610
Those tonsils are badly inflamed.
Probably have to come out.

1389
01:52:02,984 --> 01:52:05,145
But I've had them all my
life. They're old friends.

1390
01:52:06,053 --> 01:52:08,817
All right. All right.
Let's wrap this thing up.

1391
01:52:08,817 --> 01:52:11,085
I'm... I need a rest anyway.

1392
01:52:25,773 --> 01:52:26,797
Hi, Uncle Clarence.

1393
01:52:26,797 --> 01:52:29,342
Creighton. Cleva.

1394
01:52:29,844 --> 01:52:31,311
What brings you to
this neck of the woods?

1395
01:52:31,311 --> 01:52:33,904
Your dad's been in the
hospital. I wondered if you knew.

1396
01:52:34,482 --> 01:52:35,813
We read about it
in the papers.

1397
01:52:35,813 --> 01:52:38,451
Had his tonsils out. Sort
of a second childhood, huh?

1398
01:52:38,986 --> 01:52:41,648
It wasn't his tonsils.
It's malignant.

1399
01:52:43,024 --> 01:52:45,857
Your dad doesn't know it,
but it's hopeless.

1400
01:52:54,035 --> 01:52:55,195
Irving!

1401
01:52:56,471 --> 01:52:58,439
Lmagine! Tonsils at my age.

1402
01:52:58,439 --> 01:53:01,905
This just couldn't wait, Lon. I've
got one I think you'll really go for.

1403
01:53:01,905 --> 01:53:04,774
<i>A story of the French Foreign
Legion, The Bugle Sounds.</i>

1404
01:53:06,647 --> 01:53:07,671
Feels pretty good.

1405
01:53:07,671 --> 01:53:10,239
We do it in Africa, right
with the Foreign Legion.

1406
01:53:10,451 --> 01:53:13,079
Well, how about Hazel?
She go with me?

1407
01:53:13,079 --> 01:53:15,087
I'll put it
in the contract!

1408
01:53:16,757 --> 01:53:18,156
You know, Irving,

1409
01:53:18,459 --> 01:53:22,691
Hazel and I have never had a trip.
Never been anywhere, have we, honey?

1410
01:53:23,731 --> 01:53:25,096
Gonna be great, isn't it?

1411
01:53:25,096 --> 01:53:26,531
Wonderful.

1412
01:53:27,401 --> 01:53:28,459
When do we go?

1413
01:53:28,459 --> 01:53:30,060
Well, there's
a lot of preparations, Lon.

1414
01:53:30,060 --> 01:53:31,764
Like getting you well,
first. Drink this.

1415
01:53:32,940 --> 01:53:33,929
You heard me!

1416
01:53:34,342 --> 01:53:37,334
Look, if I do, will you
go away and let us talk?

1417
01:53:37,334 --> 01:53:40,208
Down the hatch!

1418
01:53:40,208 --> 01:53:41,873
Not too long,
Mr. Thalberg.

1419
01:53:45,386 --> 01:53:48,549
Lon, read it and let me know. I'll
come back and we can talk about it.

1420
01:53:48,549 --> 01:53:50,921
You'll have some ideas,
I'm sure. You always do.

1421
01:53:50,921 --> 01:53:53,392
Oh, before we get
too deep into this,

1422
01:53:53,392 --> 01:53:55,088
I'd like to take
a run up to the cabin.

1423
01:53:55,930 --> 01:53:57,693
I do my best
thinking up there.

1424
01:53:57,693 --> 01:54:00,233
Well, we'll have to ask
Dr. Shiels about that, Lon.

1425
01:54:00,233 --> 01:54:03,737
Irving, he's on your payroll.
Don't ask him, tell him.

1426
01:54:03,737 --> 01:54:05,601
Right. See you, Lon.

1427
01:54:05,601 --> 01:54:06,901
Right.

1428
01:54:15,249 --> 01:54:17,717
Thank you, Vera.
That's fine.

1429
01:54:24,191 --> 01:54:26,125
Irving, I don't know
how to thank you.

1430
01:54:26,125 --> 01:54:28,491
If he's busy thinking
and planning,

1431
01:54:28,491 --> 01:54:30,690
he won't have time to
ask too many questions.

1432
01:54:30,690 --> 01:54:32,392
We'll keep him that way.

1433
01:54:33,167 --> 01:54:35,761
He wants to go up
to the cabin, Doctor.

1434
01:54:37,772 --> 01:54:40,002
There's no reason
why he shouldn't.

1435
01:55:21,282 --> 01:55:24,979
Skillet's all set to go.
All we need is some trout.

1436
01:55:31,792 --> 01:55:33,157
Now's the time...

1437
01:55:34,462 --> 01:55:37,090
Now's the time to
catch the big ones.

1438
01:56:03,891 --> 01:56:06,086
Well! What are you
doing here?

1439
01:56:06,627 --> 01:56:09,357
Mmm. Figured two surprises
were better than one.

1440
01:56:18,606 --> 01:56:23,771
Mrs. Chaney, have I told
you lately that I love you?

1441
01:56:24,845 --> 01:56:26,676
Hmm. I don't remember.

1442
01:56:26,981 --> 01:56:28,710
Well, I do.

1443
01:56:30,284 --> 01:56:31,410
It's true.

1444
01:57:14,462 --> 01:57:15,986
How's your mother?

1445
01:57:16,731 --> 01:57:17,720
She's fine.

1446
01:57:19,267 --> 01:57:21,792
I think you should know. She
was against my leaving you.

1447
01:57:23,171 --> 01:57:25,571
Pop, she was working on a
farm, cooking for 30 men.

1448
01:57:25,571 --> 01:57:28,837
I couldn't leave her there.
I had to take care of her.

1449
01:57:30,011 --> 01:57:33,674
Yeah, I know. I should
have been proud of you,

1450
01:57:34,115 --> 01:57:36,879
but instead, I kept steaming
myself up to stay mad.

1451
01:57:38,186 --> 01:57:41,587
You know how I am,
I don't let go easy.

1452
01:57:43,691 --> 01:57:45,249
But I'm learning.

1453
01:57:49,330 --> 01:57:53,130
Hazel! You've got two starving men
on your hands. When we gonna eat?

1454
01:57:53,501 --> 01:57:56,698
I've been ready for hours.
Just waiting for the fish.

1455
01:57:59,807 --> 01:58:01,672
Well! Bring them in.

1456
01:58:37,178 --> 01:58:38,167
What?

1457
01:58:48,256 --> 01:58:49,985
He wants his makeup case.

1458
02:00:02,664 --> 02:00:04,655
He sends all of you his love.

1459
02:00:20,348 --> 02:00:24,682
He asked of us
all forgiveness.
