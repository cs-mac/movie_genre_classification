1
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:06,867
Good morning.

2
00:01:19,917 --> 00:01:21,342
Hey, Cutter.

3
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:22,917
Your lawyer is here.

4
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:37,000
There is literally nothing left for
me to do, your appeal was denied.

5
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:40,492
- Look, you got a little shy of eleven months...
- Ten months!

6
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:42,175
Ten months. Whatever...

7
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:45,175
That's better, right? Just ride it out.
You gotta do your the time right.

8
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,833
Call Keegan.

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,500
- No.
- Call him.

10
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:51,583
No.

11
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:55,542
OK, as your attorney, I advise you
just to ride out the eleven months.

12
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:58,488
Ten months! Martin, call him. Today!

13
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
SUV huh?

14
00:02:21,167 --> 00:02:22,533
You know Daphne.

15
00:02:22,917 --> 00:02:24,383
What are you gonna do?

16
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,292
So, what the fuck, Ray?

17
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:30,375
Nine months to go and-and what. You call Keegan?

18
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:31,667
Why would you do that?

19
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,500
That's such a wicked price to pay, you know.

20
00:02:41,042 --> 00:02:42,125
Fuck.

21
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,083
You're still gonna tell me what's going on, right?

22
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:57,125
Oh, yeah. I'll tell you.

23
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:25,208
Jesus Christ!

24
00:03:25,917 --> 00:03:27,333
What the hell are you doing here?

25
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:29,250
You're not on the lam, are you?

26
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,917
Yeah, pop, I tunnel out.

27
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:32,467
Oh, that's funny.

28
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:33,783
Where is he?

29
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:35,367
Upstairs.

30
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,583
How the fuck did you get out, Raymond?

31
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:10,975
Yeah?

32
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:13,725
Hey.

33
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,225
Dad?

34
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:22,808
Right.

35
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:24,167
How did you get out?

36
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:29,458
I know it's hard to believe
but, judge granted my appeal.

37
00:04:33,667 --> 00:04:35,675
I didn't know you're into all this.

38
00:04:38,417 --> 00:04:40,450
What are you working on? That's-that's good.

39
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,500
It's just plastic pieces.

40
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:50,167
Yeah, but you got to put them
together and paint all the details...

41
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,250
Dad.

42
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,942
Let's not do this, OK?

43
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:05,467
Yeah...

44
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,133
OK.

45
00:05:15,292 --> 00:05:16,833
<i>So? How did it go?</i>

46
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:25,592
Well...

47
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,500
he has some tests...

48
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:31,342
tomorrow.

49
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:40,250
I'd like to think you didn't
do something foolish...

50
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,250
just to be here.

51
00:05:46,792 --> 00:05:48,192
Oh, fuck it.

52
00:06:33,308 --> 00:06:34,608
Excuse me.

53
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,667
Excuse me. Thank you.

54
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:38,875
Guys, gotta get through. Excuse me.

55
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,208
Excuse me. Miss.

56
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:44,625
Tommy.

57
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,400
I was just now standing there, with my dick in my
hand, I'm shaking it off and thinking to myself.

58
00:06:49,513 --> 00:06:51,566
Wonder when the forger's
gonna walk through my door?

59
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:52,625
- Tommy.
- What?

60
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,333
Right there.

61
00:06:55,434 --> 00:06:56,434
Jesus.

62
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,408
Can't tell from the camera
angle of this guy right here.

63
00:06:58,492 --> 00:07:00,400
He's got huge fucking balls.

64
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:02,092
Dealing product from behind my bar.

65
00:07:02,976 --> 00:07:03,976
I got him.

66
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,333
Got to deal with this.

67
00:07:05,417 --> 00:07:06,833
Fucking Chuck town junkie.

68
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,500
So, Ray.

69
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:20,451
You calling me with ten months to go.
'Cause what, you're-you're-you're bored?

70
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,458
I really appreciate what you did for me but...

71
00:07:24,292 --> 00:07:26,792
- I need a little time.
- 50K, Ray.

72
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,333
It's the going rate for judges.

73
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:30,717
And time?

74
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,708
No. It's something you don't got.

75
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:37,875
Don't... Don't look like that, already.

76
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,583
Since you went away. I've been in
business with these guys. It's...

77
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,100
These chainsaws, Ray.

78
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:49,050
Compared to them, I'm a fucking humanitarian.

79
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:52,114
You know this painting?

80
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,307
Yeah.

81
00:07:53,542 --> 00:07:54,742
Do it.

82
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:56,375
Do it? What do you mean, do it?

83
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,250
You mean-you mean forge it?

84
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,167
It's a Monet. What the fuck for?

85
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,383
So you can steal the real one.

86
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:11,003
Steal? What are you talking about?
Steal the real one?

87
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:12,667
In three weeks...

88
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,625
It's gonna be on display, right here.

89
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:17,750
And the guy who wants it.
He's gonna be in Boston, too.

90
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,475
For one night only.

91
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:21,142
That's impossible.

92
00:08:21,183 --> 00:08:23,767
Three weeks. I can't do that.

93
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,308
Look, it's either yes...

94
00:08:26,292 --> 00:08:27,633
or I make a phone call.

95
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,325
And you go back to prison.

96
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,500
Yes or no. You have 48 hours to make a decision.

97
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:35,883
Welcome home, Ray.

98
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:43,500
- Jesus!
- I'm so sorry.

99
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:44,916
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

100
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:48,283
Where you going? Haven't seen you
around here before. I'm Catherine.

101
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:50,317
- I'm Ray.
- Ray. Nice to meet you, Ray.

102
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,042
Hey, you know Tommy?

103
00:08:52,417 --> 00:08:53,417
Tommy?

104
00:08:55,417 --> 00:08:56,417
Yeah.

105
00:08:56,792 --> 00:08:58,167
- Alright, I gotta go...
- Hey-hey-hey!

106
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,250
Wanna go somewhere?

107
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,500
Oh, thank you.

108
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,708
Wow, is this your car?

109
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,208
So cool.

110
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,750
Can I drop you off somewhere?

111
00:09:11,292 --> 00:09:12,403
- Drop me?
- Yeah.

112
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,375
Yeah, I got things to do and
you don't wanna be in there.

113
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,956
Stay out of there. And stay away from Tommy Keegan.

114
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,975
OK. There's better people
and there's better places.

115
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,125
Hey!

116
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:30,783
Are you serious?

117
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:49,833
Hey.

118
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:51,367
You hungry?

119
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,050
Not for those.

120
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,333
OK.

121
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,700
Well, eggs it is.

122
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:12,542
Where's gramps?

123
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,833
He's out. But I'm gonaa take you today.

124
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:28,450
Because of it's location in the
midsection of the brain stem.

125
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:31,042
It makes it very difficult to remove surgically.

126
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:34,583
I'm sorry, Mr. Cutter.

127
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,725
I know this is difficult.

128
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:41,242
- Do you have any questions?
- Yeah, I do. What do you do now?

129
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,433
I mean... you know. What-what-what is the plan?

130
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,576
- The plan?
- Yeah!

131
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,417
Is he gonna be in pain? I mean,
what-what-what's gonna happen?

132
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,708
What we should focus on is...

133
00:10:49,792 --> 00:10:53,083
keeping William as comfortable
as possible during the process.

134
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,383
Then what?

135
00:10:57,917 --> 00:11:00,833
Well, you know, it's... it's impossible to say.

136
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,208
Each patient is very different.

137
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,250
- So?
- So?

138
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,508
So what?

139
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,050
What'd they say?

140
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,708
Gramps took it out.

141
00:11:26,775 --> 00:11:27,875
He took it out?

142
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:29,708
Why'd he take it out?

143
00:11:29,867 --> 00:11:32,483
He hit it too many times. Sprained his wrist.

144
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,042
So, the chemo... will it cure me?

145
00:11:42,292 --> 00:11:44,292
- The fuck did he take the horn out for?
- Dad.

146
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,700
Fuck.

147
00:11:46,917 --> 00:11:48,167
Will-will the chemo cure me?

148
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:49,976
Oh, Will.

149
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,942
Dad, for once in your fucking life.
Could you just tell me the truth?

150
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,875
I don't know.

151
00:12:38,851 --> 00:12:39,851
<i>Can I help you?</i>

152
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:41,417
<i>I like to see the man in charge.</i>

153
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:43,425
<i>In here.</i>

154
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,000
Hey, gramps.

155
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,467
Can I have one of those?

156
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,208
<i>I want to report a murder.</i>

157
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,800
<i>Sit down.</i>

158
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,283
<i>The name's Bigelow,
Frank Bigelow.</i>?

159
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,833
<i>Where was this murder committed?</i>

160
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,008
<i>San Francisco. . Last night.</i>

161
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,417
<i>Who was murdered?</i>

162
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,800
<i>I was.</i>

163
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:17,042
Sean Mcgill. Lived in Cambridge.

164
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,042
- 28 years old today.
- I knew him.

165
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:21,017
Bartender at the Palace.

166
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:23,550
Talked to him the night before last.
Watched him get fired.

167
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:27,193
Finn Gerrity... told him to walk,
right when he came on shift.

168
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,875
Like they caught him in something.
He looked scared.

169
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,500
- Any way we can this to Keegan?
- Love to.

170
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:34,350
Alright, guys, Come on in here and do your jobs.

171
00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:37,283
Get that new trace heroin to the
lab, see if we can match it.

172
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:40,505
Do me a favor. Why don't you fingerprint
the fuck out of this place, huh?

173
00:13:40,633 --> 00:13:43,833
Know what's hard? Relying on local
law enforcement to connect the dots.

174
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,550
Well, it's tough all over. Do you
want me to get you a tissue? Huh?

175
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:49,283
What do you wanna know?

176
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,667
There's a guy. Ray.

177
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:53,542
Met with Keegan that night.

178
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:57,167
Buick Skylark, license plate 'J433K6'.

179
00:13:58,917 --> 00:14:00,667
OK. What's so special about this guy?

180
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,375
I don't know. Something.

181
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:05,000
- I think he made me.
- Made you?

182
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,208
Like... DEA made you?

183
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,633
- Just a cop.
- Oh, just a cop.

184
00:14:14,008 --> 00:14:15,908
Did you talk to Keegan?

185
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:19,367
What did he want?

186
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,333
One answer. Tomorrow.

187
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,867
About what? About a job?

188
00:14:25,042 --> 00:14:26,042
Yeah.

189
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,158
What do you want?

190
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,333
What I want...

191
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,667
What I've always wanted, Carl.

192
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,408
Go to Tahiti and live like Gauguin.

193
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:41,692
In Tahiti?

194
00:14:46,042 --> 00:14:47,742
What's Will want?

195
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:55,017
I don't know.

196
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,975
Hey, Will. Check it out.

197
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:11,950
Don't even think about it.

198
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What?

199
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,633
You're not gonna sign me up
for something like that.

200
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:19,050
- What? You don't want to meet nobody?
- No. I don't want to meet at all.

201
00:15:19,107 --> 00:15:21,232
Or go to Disneyland, or meet Tom Brady.

202
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:22,375
Why not?

203
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,625
Because dad, it's embarrassing. What's the point?

204
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:26,458
What? Y-you don't want to do anything?

205
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:28,042
Yeah, I'd like to stop talking about it.

206
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,000
Hi, handsome. You been waiting long?

207
00:15:30,542 --> 00:15:32,042
No, not long.

208
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:43,967
What if I did that?

209
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:46,792
Dad, just dropped it.

210
00:15:47,101 --> 00:15:48,101
No, I mean it.

211
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:53,625
What if you... you made a wish. You could
even make like three wishes. Like a genie.

212
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,208
Dad, a genie?

213
00:15:55,292 --> 00:15:56,875
You are not a genie. Jesus Christ.

214
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,125
No, I'm serious, Will.

215
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,333
You make what... make any... anything.

216
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:03,800
Anything you want.

217
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,408
Like you'd follow through with it.

218
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,542
How do you know? I-I might surprise you.

219
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,092
Give me a chance.

220
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,050
Alright then.

221
00:16:15,633 --> 00:16:18,283
You know what I wish for? I
wished I didn't have cancer.

222
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,550
Is that fair?

223
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:30,933
I don't know, dad, you tell me.
You're the genie, right?

224
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,775
Look at you. I think those
girls were checking you out.

225
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,175
Dad, stop.

226
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,092
They're like 20-something.

227
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:58,625
I was joking.

228
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:03,658
So, you had a girlfriend, right? Like...
Tracy, or Trixie, or something like that.

229
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:07,059
How'd you know about her?

230
00:17:07,284 --> 00:17:08,341
Gramps.

231
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,875
I asked about you all the time when I was away.

232
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,567
You talking about Tricia?

233
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,392
Yeah, Tricia... you, uh... How
long did you go out with her?

234
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:25,667
Dad...

235
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,350
Can we drop it, huh?

236
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:31,325
Yeah, I gotta go to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

237
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,698
I got my son sitting over there.

238
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:42,107
If you could, give him anything he wants.
And I'll have a cheese burger and a coffee.

239
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:51,633
- Guess what today is, Cutter?
- I know what day it is.

240
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,167
Now look, I'm having lunch with my son.

241
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,927
So, why don't you just tell Tommy
that I'll see him later, OK?

242
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,633
I haven't forgotten.

243
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,108
Fuck you, Cutter.

244
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,667
So who's the guy you followed into the bathroom?

245
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,750
What guy?

246
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,242
Dad, I saw you follow the guy in there.

247
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,900
Burger, no onions and a grilled cheese.

248
00:18:22,942 --> 00:18:23,992
Anything else you need?

249
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,417
No, that's it. Thanks.

250
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,083
Grilled cheese, that's all?

251
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:30,217
- Yeah.
- Why?

252
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,250
Dad, I don't know.

253
00:18:31,292 --> 00:18:32,533
My stomach hurts.

254
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:33,842
Why're you worried about it?

255
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:37,832
So you're really not gonna
tell me who the guy was?

256
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,301
I owe his boss money and he
came to remind me. That's it.

257
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,700
How much you owe him?

258
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,583
You know, I really don't want
to burden you with this stuff.

259
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:51,283
Dad, I don't care. You can tell me.

260
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:53,892
I don't see why you're so
scared to tell me things.

261
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,183
Fifty grand, OK?

262
00:18:57,217 --> 00:18:59,333
- Holy shit, fifty thousand dollars?
- Yeah.

263
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,642
How do you owe him 50 thousands dollars? For what?

264
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:11,399
Because we had to pay the judge to bribe him.

265
00:19:11,424 --> 00:19:13,224
In order to get out early, so...

266
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,175
So I could-I could spend some time with you.

267
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,792
I want to meet my mother.

268
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,075
What?

269
00:19:47,792 --> 00:19:49,533
I want to meet my mother.

270
00:19:49,801 --> 00:19:51,801
- Your mother?
- Yeah, dad.

271
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:54,166
Yeah, I want to meet her.

272
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:57,543
- Oh, gee, Will...
- Am I talking to a genie, or what?

273
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,208
But I don't know where she is.

274
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:03,750
I thought you said she moved
away, to that fancy condo.

275
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,325
Yeah, exactly. You know... the condo, right.

276
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,800
OK then.

277
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,292
That's my first wish.

278
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:21,942
Agent Paisley.

279
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,792
I got your guy, Raymond Cutter.

280
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,417
<i>Five years forgery.</i>

281
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,833
<i>Fresh out of Northport. Ten
months early for good behavior.</i>

282
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,325
<i>Forgery? You don't hear that every day.</i>

283
00:20:29,408 --> 00:20:32,375
<i>No, you do not. Busted back in '87
for art fraud and then nothing,</i>

284
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,971
until someone dropped a dime on him.

285
00:20:33,996 --> 00:20:34,999
Who?

286
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,400
Tommy Keegan.

287
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:38,850
That's right. Your bad guy.

288
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,208
They say that Cutter took the fall.

289
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:42,500
The Buick...

290
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:45,417
Is registered to his dad, Joseph Cutter.

291
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,333
Old school conman, pickpocket, petty thief.

292
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:50,583
It stretches up and down the east coast.

293
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,508
Buy me a drink and I'll read you his rap sheet.

294
00:20:52,592 --> 00:20:56,085
And Keegan is a felon, so Cutter violated
his parole when he went and visited him.

295
00:20:56,425 --> 00:20:57,542
You wanna do, bring him in?

296
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:59,667
Nope, wanna watch him.

297
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:08,042
Who's the buyer?

298
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,508
Buyer? There's no buyer.

299
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,167
He's just a guy...

300
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,758
and he wants it.

301
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,569
I gotta pay for a fucking... what is it?

302
00:21:17,594 --> 00:21:18,724
Appraiser?

303
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,425
Do you believe in that shit?

304
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,175
Making me pay.

305
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,250
I don't know...

306
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:26,583
You know any?

307
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,592
For stolen art?

308
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:29,967
Yeah.

309
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:31,758
Legit?

310
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,567
I don't know. Maybe...

311
00:21:36,042 --> 00:21:38,250
Maybe Owensby, from Minnesota.

312
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,533
Something like that.

313
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:40,825
Minnesota...

314
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:42,268
So, how much?

315
00:21:42,292 --> 00:21:43,633
Nothing, Ray.

316
00:21:45,042 --> 00:21:48,083
I'm getting you out of a jam,
and you getting me out of one.

317
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,125
Do you want to go back to prison?

318
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,533
Or do you want to just do this thing?

319
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,083
What do you want?

320
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:07,033
I'll need, um... a painting of the same year.

321
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:08,758
Same size.

322
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:12,108
And, uh... when I find it...

323
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:16,191
whatever it costs, you gotta
be ready to pay for it.

324
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:22,642
Yeah, yeah. This is Ronald Chambers.

325
00:22:23,292 --> 00:22:24,492
Chambers.

326
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,133
Yeah, I'm looking for something specific.

327
00:22:27,258 --> 00:22:29,200
I'm looking for something French.

328
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,050
Circa 1875.

329
00:22:32,042 --> 00:22:33,725
40 inches by 32 inches.

330
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:35,092
Let's go, boy.

331
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:40,167
No, that doesn't matter, it doesn't matter.
Just it-it's period and-and-and size.

332
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:43,467
Hey, gramp.

333
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,917
What was grandma like?

334
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:47,200
Your grandmother was a saint.

335
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:50,200
She never lied, she never... gossipped.

336
00:22:50,792 --> 00:22:54,467
And she'd give you the last... dime in her pocket.

337
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,600
I don't know... She didn't deserved to
suffer her life with me, I tell you.

338
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:01,100
Jesus Christ!

339
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:05,792
- How old was dad when she died?
- Four.

340
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:10,842
So, it's just you two, then.

341
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:12,200
You guys get along?

342
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,100
What kind of a question is that?

343
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:16,325
I was just... just wondering.

344
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:18,083
Wondering... wondering why?

345
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,417
Well, I don't know, I guess I
never see you guys hug or...

346
00:23:23,425 --> 00:23:25,367
or say you love each other.

347
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:27,300
Yeah, well, I don't do that.

348
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,667
But he knows.

349
00:23:31,101 --> 00:23:32,101
You sure?

350
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:35,000
I didn't tell your grandmother
either, but she knew.

351
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,000
Why? Because words don't mean
a shit in this world, Will.

352
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:41,200
It's what a person does feel that counts.

353
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:49,975
Well, what about my mother?

354
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,250
You ever meet her?

355
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:54,608
Oh, that's what this is all about, is it?

356
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,333
Yeah.

357
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:59,900
Dad asked me what I wanted and I, I told him...

358
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:02,363
I want to meet my mother.

359
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:03,708
Yeah? Well, fuck that.

360
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,500
Get in the car.

361
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:12,375
All I know is, one of Keegans' guys got busted.

362
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:14,417
Lost an entire load of H.

363
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:16,458
Now Tommy owes someone.

364
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,750
Who?

365
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:19,708
I don't know.

366
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,750
But it's a lot of dough.

367
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:25,458
Any fucking idea what you're doing?

368
00:24:26,425 --> 00:24:27,475
Nope.

369
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,549
Oh.

370
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,208
Good.

371
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,458
- Hey.
- Hey.

372
00:24:38,684 --> 00:24:39,684
Uncle Carl.

373
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:40,708
Hey, Will.

374
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,767
How you doing, buddy?

375
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:44,108
- Alright.
- Good to see you.

376
00:24:44,133 --> 00:24:45,242
Alright, alright.

377
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:46,875
You, upstairs.

378
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,025
You, get in the wind.

379
00:24:49,167 --> 00:24:50,467
You, out back.

380
00:24:50,517 --> 00:24:51,556
Call me tomorrow?

381
00:24:51,581 --> 00:24:53,574
- Why?
- Out back!

382
00:24:54,633 --> 00:24:55,833
So.

383
00:24:56,258 --> 00:24:57,558
What are you doing?

384
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:59,842
Promising that he can see his mother, huh?

385
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:02,458
Well, how do you think he's going
to feel if you don't deliver?

386
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:05,233
And God forbid if you do. Bullshit!

387
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:07,167
Whatever you're going to say is bullshit!

388
00:25:09,867 --> 00:25:11,875
Four years we've been here, Ray.

389
00:25:12,792 --> 00:25:14,291
Me and Will.

390
00:25:14,292 --> 00:25:15,892
And we are doing fine.

391
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:18,542
And you come catapulting out of prison.

392
00:25:18,792 --> 00:25:20,092
Jesus!

393
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,842
You tell me the truth.

394
00:25:23,417 --> 00:25:25,200
How did you get out?

395
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:29,283
Keegan.

396
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:31,092
Oh, fuck me.

397
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:32,875
Tell me you're lying.

398
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,167
Tell me you're not in it for Tommy fucking Keegan!

399
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,542
Jesus, Mary and me!

400
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:39,833
How much?

401
00:25:39,917 --> 00:25:42,167
How much are you in it for him?
Oh, no, don't...

402
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:46,125
don't tell me. I-d, I... I don't want to hear it.

403
00:25:46,726 --> 00:25:47,726
Go.

404
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,275
Take Will and...

405
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:51,350
get the fuck out of town.

406
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:56,333
I need your help, pop.

407
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:58,058
You know something?

408
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:04,592
You should have stayed inside.

409
00:26:43,175 --> 00:26:44,375
Closed, now.

410
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:45,875
Rodney, remember me?

411
00:26:46,351 --> 00:26:47,351
Ray.

412
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:48,375
No.

413
00:26:48,542 --> 00:26:49,542
Kim's ex.

414
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:52,250
What the fuck do you want?

415
00:26:52,417 --> 00:26:53,700
I need to know where she is.

416
00:26:53,724 --> 00:26:54,791
No.

417
00:26:54,792 --> 00:26:55,992
I haven't seen her.

418
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,667
Oh, come on, you know where she is.

419
00:26:57,917 --> 00:26:59,042
Told you, Ray.

420
00:26:59,292 --> 00:27:01,458
I haven't see that fucking bitch in years.

421
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:04,000
Look, Rodney, I'm not here to cause any trouble.

422
00:27:04,042 --> 00:27:06,000
- Are you here to cause any trouble?
- I just wanna know where she is.

423
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:07,908
- Come on, this ain't that kind of visit.
- Hey!

424
00:27:07,942 --> 00:27:09,817
- <i>Go check it out.</i>
- Get this guy out of my fucking shop!

425
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,617
- Oh, give me a fucking break, will you?
- Get the fuck out, Ray.

426
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:13,141
Let's go buddy.

427
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,708
Never liked you, Ray!

428
00:27:20,032 --> 00:27:22,032
Never liked you!

429
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,708
Come on! I'm gonna get you!

430
00:28:03,167 --> 00:28:04,167
Fuck!

431
00:28:09,591 --> 00:28:11,291
Fucking fucker.

432
00:28:12,092 --> 00:28:13,684
Where? Fuck you!

433
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:16,079
- Last time. Where?
- Fuck you!

434
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:18,658
That's it. I'm not asking again.

435
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:20,625
You want "Ray" in your fucking forehead?

436
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:21,708
Fuck off!

437
00:28:22,792 --> 00:28:24,291
- I'm going to ask you again.
- Fuck you!

438
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:25,642
- Fuck!
- Where?

439
00:28:27,042 --> 00:28:28,542
Prescott Road!

440
00:28:28,733 --> 00:28:30,233
It's in Braintree.

441
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,500
That's where she is, I swear.

442
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:33,667
I do...

443
00:29:47,042 --> 00:29:48,558
How'd you find me?

444
00:29:48,633 --> 00:29:49,658
Rodney.

445
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:50,667
Fuck.

446
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:54,117
That was easy.

447
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,775
Not really.

448
00:29:59,292 --> 00:30:00,692
What do you want?

449
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:03,654
Your son, Will. He wants to see you.

450
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:09,067
What is he now? 12?

451
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:10,425
Try 15.

452
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:15,617
- Does he remember me?
- Hmm-mmm.

453
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,886
I mean what? All of a sudden he wants to see me?

454
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,000
This isn't you...

455
00:30:23,042 --> 00:30:25,658
- Trying to hook me back into you and your dad...
- Your son is sick.

456
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,150
He's got cancer.

457
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,688
He's got a stage 4 tumor in his head.

458
00:30:29,713 --> 00:30:30,925
OK?

459
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:34,425
So I need you to clean yourself up...

460
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:36,600
put your best face on...

461
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:38,283
- and have lunch with us on Wednesday.
- No.

462
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,375
I can't do that.

463
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:40,875
- Oh, yes, you can.
- No, I can't.

464
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:43,768
W-wait a minute, I just told
you that your son was dying.

465
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:48,275
And you can't do this? Wh-wh-who are you?

466
00:30:48,875 --> 00:30:49,875
You're gonna do this.

467
00:30:50,042 --> 00:30:53,280
Or I'm going to make your fucking life
more miserable than it already is.

468
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,192
I'll be back at noon. You be ready.

469
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:03,775
Hold-hold... hold still now.

470
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:07,167
Oh, did it hurt, Ray?

471
00:31:07,258 --> 00:31:09,425
- Just get on with it, will you?
- Heh, heh.

472
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:12,150
Will you be needing a tissue?

473
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:15,167
Are you done?

474
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:16,925
Yeah, done.

475
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:18,583
So.

476
00:31:19,292 --> 00:31:20,592
It was Keegan.

477
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:23,408
Rodney.

478
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:26,678
Oh... Christ, Ray.

479
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,800
I'm sorry, dad.

480
00:31:36,417 --> 00:31:38,017
You were right.

481
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:40,467
Alright.

482
00:31:40,875 --> 00:31:42,467
What can I do?

483
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:44,983
Is Will good?

484
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,100
He's sleeping.

485
00:31:46,167 --> 00:31:48,667
It was a tough night for the Cutter boys.

486
00:31:50,042 --> 00:31:51,542
What do you need?

487
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:54,133
Ivan.

488
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:55,948
He still in business?

489
00:31:56,042 --> 00:31:57,242
Ivan?

490
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:59,375
Of course, he is.

491
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:01,292
That russky is like a cockroach.

492
00:32:01,316 --> 00:32:03,816
- Heh, heh...
- Heh...

493
00:32:06,325 --> 00:32:08,650
And here he comes...

494
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:11,026
Sha-wing... a hit!

495
00:32:12,874 --> 00:32:14,774
Oh, man.

496
00:32:15,292 --> 00:32:17,933
- Who's the victim?
- Rodney Hunter. Three time loser.

497
00:32:17,983 --> 00:32:21,192
Spousal abuse, identity fraud and
possession of methamphetamines.

498
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:23,083
And what's he got to say about this?

499
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Nothing.

500
00:32:25,167 --> 00:32:29,266
According to Mr. Hunter, your Raymond Cutter was
looking for somebody that they had in common.

501
00:32:29,351 --> 00:32:30,351
Who?

502
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:32,042
His ex-wife, Kim o'Halloran.

503
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,467
I'm running her down now. But so far...

504
00:32:35,075 --> 00:32:39,833
your boy has violated his parole
like one, two... five counts now.

505
00:32:42,542 --> 00:32:43,867
What do you want to do?

506
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,658
I want to know why.

507
00:32:48,042 --> 00:32:49,042
Here.

508
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,700
Yeah, that's her.

509
00:32:53,742 --> 00:32:55,975
So why has she got such a hardon for you, anyway?

510
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,075
No, it's Keegan she wants.

511
00:32:58,792 --> 00:33:01,717
She just saw me come out of his
office and probably thought I was...

512
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:04,617
you know. Hanging with another felon and shit.

513
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,150
If Rodney dropped a dime on me...

514
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:08,167
fuck!

515
00:33:08,258 --> 00:33:09,498
I don't got time for this.

516
00:33:09,592 --> 00:33:10,617
Yeah.

517
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:12,683
Come on. I want to show you something.

518
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:19,242
You know a lot of these old buildings have
hidden rooms left over from the prohibition.

519
00:33:19,417 --> 00:33:22,183
You can't even get to them from the inside.

520
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,800
Wicked cool, huh?

521
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:42,133
It's good.

522
00:33:43,792 --> 00:33:45,083
It's a stupid plan.

523
00:33:46,417 --> 00:33:47,717
Which part?

524
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:49,067
No, I'm serious.

525
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:51,250
What makes you think you can pull it off?

526
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:53,250
I mean, you haven't painted
anything for fucking years.

527
00:33:54,143 --> 00:33:56,843
You're right, I haven't. But it
doesn't mean I never wanted to.

528
00:33:57,833 --> 00:34:00,952
In fact, up till now, it's the
only thing I ever thought about.

529
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,175
Are you good?

530
00:34:05,542 --> 00:34:06,842
Let's go.

531
00:34:14,425 --> 00:34:15,989
Look, could you tell Ivan that, uh...

532
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:18,575
Joseph Cutter's here to see him, please?

533
00:34:18,675 --> 00:34:19,875
Ivan's not here.

534
00:34:20,917 --> 00:34:22,117
Oh, yeah, he is.

535
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:23,817
I watched him come back from the deli.

536
00:34:23,942 --> 00:34:25,042
He's back there right now.

537
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:27,750
Feeding his fat face, with a
fucking corn beef sandwich.

538
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:30,575
- Take a walk old man.
- Tell you what.

539
00:34:30,833 --> 00:34:31,833
If I win...

540
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:34,283
take me to Ivan.

541
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:36,250
If, uh... you win...

542
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,400
you got this.

543
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:42,125
- Alright.
- On the count of three.

544
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:44,833
One.

545
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:46,650
Two.

546
00:34:46,917 --> 00:34:47,917
Three.

547
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,800
Son of a bitch.

548
00:34:54,583 --> 00:34:56,650
I told you never to come in here again, Cutter.

549
00:34:56,733 --> 00:35:00,583
Well, I just happen to have, in my
possession, a little shopping list.

550
00:35:01,042 --> 00:35:03,292
You see, I'm not selling. I'm buying...

551
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:06,375
your services as a procurement specialist.

552
00:35:06,542 --> 00:35:09,667
You know, scrounger, as in king fucking rat.

553
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:14,133
Copper acetate.

554
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:15,559
Cadmium.

555
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:16,908
Arsenic sulfide.

556
00:35:16,958 --> 00:35:18,017
Cinnabar...

557
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:20,042
What the fuck? These are chemicals.

558
00:35:20,167 --> 00:35:21,167
And minerals.

559
00:35:21,542 --> 00:35:23,775
And a lot of them fucking poisonous.

560
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,900
Read it carefully.

561
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,692
We're gonna need it all, and we need it quick.

562
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:34,925
- Hey.
- Hey.

563
00:35:35,208 --> 00:35:36,208
Ronald Chambers.

564
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,892
- Oh, dude! Awesome.
- Yeah.

565
00:35:38,017 --> 00:35:39,107
Great to meet you.

566
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:40,167
Yeah, wow.

567
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:41,833
Yeah, I'm gutting the place.

568
00:35:41,917 --> 00:35:43,000
It was my grandparents'.

569
00:35:43,042 --> 00:35:44,250
Oh. And now it's yours?

570
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:45,633
Now, it's mine.

571
00:35:53,167 --> 00:35:54,467
It's epic.

572
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:59,575
This... this guy... was-was an inventor.

573
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,758
He was a philosopher.

574
00:36:02,792 --> 00:36:05,675
He was, um... he was a patron of the arts...

575
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:08,250
Not a good painter.

576
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,300
But he was friends with Degas.

577
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,317
- No shit!
- No shit.

578
00:36:15,292 --> 00:36:17,283
So, how much for the bad one?

579
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:19,667
This one?

580
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:21,375
That one.

581
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:26,583
Would you look at this?

582
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,800
What am I looking at? Paint by fucking numbers?

583
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:33,575
Evidence. From Cutter's 1987 conviction.

584
00:36:34,083 --> 00:36:38,417
Most of the stuff was auctioned off as lesser
known pieces by Paul Gauguin, except for this one.

585
00:36:39,583 --> 00:36:41,333
Which is in a museum in Paris.

586
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:43,000
So, so why would he forged it?

587
00:36:43,025 --> 00:36:45,174
I mean, like... why would someone
steal a famous painting?

588
00:36:45,242 --> 00:36:47,775
You can't... sell it. You can't
exactly show it to people.

589
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:49,225
Status.

590
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:50,375
Look at this.

591
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,583
Raul Carlos, head of the Arroyo cartel,

592
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:56,506
is reported to have the largest private
art collection in Latin America.

593
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:59,992
You think that Keegan and Cutter are
trying to run a scam on your boy?

594
00:37:00,042 --> 00:37:01,042
Scam?

595
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,283
Carlos is a bad guy.

596
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,800
I sure as hell wouldn't.

597
00:39:43,292 --> 00:39:44,492
Kim?

598
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:47,717
You up?

599
00:39:50,025 --> 00:39:51,733
Mother fucker!

600
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:02,708
So?

601
00:40:12,917 --> 00:40:14,217
You look nice.

602
00:40:28,875 --> 00:40:29,875
You coming in?

603
00:40:29,917 --> 00:40:30,917
No.

604
00:40:31,125 --> 00:40:32,767
I think you should.

605
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:46,300
Well, Kim.

606
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,542
Just look at you.

607
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:51,567
- Look at you.
- Pops.

608
00:40:56,292 --> 00:40:57,348
Hi.

609
00:40:57,849 --> 00:40:59,275
Hi.

610
00:41:02,167 --> 00:41:03,717
OK, we should go.

611
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,550
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

612
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:19,216
So, uh... where in New York do you live?

613
00:41:19,823 --> 00:41:21,223
Um...

614
00:41:21,242 --> 00:41:23,233
Right near Times Square.

615
00:41:29,125 --> 00:41:30,705
I hope you're not a Yankees fan.

616
00:41:30,792 --> 00:41:32,792
Ha! Not really.

617
00:41:33,442 --> 00:41:36,863
Good. 'Cause I don't know if I could
be your son any more if you were.

618
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:45,325
So...

619
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:49,933
Do you have a girlfriend?

620
00:41:52,875 --> 00:41:54,075
No.

621
00:42:05,125 --> 00:42:06,758
Excuse me a minute.

622
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:38,925
You OK?

623
00:42:39,417 --> 00:42:40,542
- What?
- You OK?

624
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:41,750
Yeah.

625
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,500
You like her?

626
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Yeah.

627
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:47,383
She's nice.

628
00:43:21,575 --> 00:43:22,875
I'm starving.

629
00:43:22,917 --> 00:43:23,917
What's good here?

630
00:43:24,417 --> 00:43:25,667
The grilled salmon's good.

631
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,792
Is that what you're getting?

632
00:43:28,917 --> 00:43:29,917
I think so.

633
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:33,192
Then that's what I'll have, too.

634
00:43:34,717 --> 00:43:36,017
OK.

635
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:54,375
So...

636
00:43:54,583 --> 00:43:55,750
What's New York like?

637
00:43:56,042 --> 00:43:57,917
Like Boston, only bigger.

638
00:43:59,542 --> 00:44:01,317
No one, drives.

639
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:04,075
Everyone takes a taxi or the subway.

640
00:44:04,542 --> 00:44:06,083
So do you live in a nice building?

641
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,550
I like it.

642
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:10,250
- We have a game room.
- Nice.

643
00:44:11,083 --> 00:44:13,767
- A hot tub on the roof.
- Oh, wow.

644
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:18,050
I'd love to see that.

645
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:20,283
When you get better, you should come visit.

646
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:21,750
Yeah. Yeah.

647
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:24,083
I will.

648
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:39,092
These are really hot.

649
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,400
Thank you, sir.

650
00:44:52,825 --> 00:44:54,125
Pretzel.

651
00:44:56,792 --> 00:44:58,492
Here you go.

652
00:45:12,075 --> 00:45:13,375
Dip in.

653
00:45:18,417 --> 00:45:20,300
Wish you weren't going so soon.

654
00:45:20,925 --> 00:45:22,517
Wish you could stay longer.

655
00:45:25,417 --> 00:45:26,800
So, why-why aren't you flying?

656
00:45:26,817 --> 00:45:27,835
Ha-ha.

657
00:45:27,836 --> 00:45:31,308
You don't have wings, you got to get in a plane.

658
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:36,583
Goodbye, William.

659
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,017
I had a really great day.

660
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:40,933
Yeah. Me, too.

661
00:46:00,542 --> 00:46:01,942
Wait here.

662
00:46:20,542 --> 00:46:21,842
Thanks.

663
00:46:27,125 --> 00:46:28,325
OK.

664
00:46:28,917 --> 00:46:30,833
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

665
00:46:39,917 --> 00:46:41,317
She is nice.

666
00:46:43,917 --> 00:46:45,608
- She was nice, dad...
- Yeah.

667
00:46:46,542 --> 00:46:47,942
Yeah, I told you.

668
00:46:54,833 --> 00:46:56,817
Thanks. Thanks for pretending.

669
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,800
What do you mean pretending? Pretending what?

670
00:47:00,292 --> 00:47:01,792
Yeah, you know.

671
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,600
About her... living in New York and...

672
00:47:05,642 --> 00:47:08,075
and not being a drug addict.

673
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:17,000
Glad I got to meet her.

674
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,500
You OK?

675
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:33,583
Yeah.

676
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:34,625
Feeling sick?

677
00:47:34,708 --> 00:47:37,208
No, I'm fine. Just... you know.

678
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:39,375
Gramp's breakfast.

679
00:47:41,542 --> 00:47:43,233
- We ready to go?
- Yeah.

680
00:47:44,492 --> 00:47:46,292
- What does it feel like?
- What?

681
00:47:46,792 --> 00:47:48,092
The chemo.

682
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,592
I don't know. It feels like shit.

683
00:47:58,792 --> 00:47:59,992
You OK?

684
00:48:02,042 --> 00:48:03,842
What's going on?

685
00:48:08,417 --> 00:48:09,617
Alright.

686
00:48:11,292 --> 00:48:13,825
Promise you're not gonna laugh.

687
00:48:14,208 --> 00:48:15,908
I'm not gonna laugh.

688
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,200
I want to have sex.

689
00:48:25,792 --> 00:48:27,792
That's my second wish.

690
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,250
So the bad news is they got a gallery mast on.

691
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,000
They got wireless sensors on
all the doors and windows...

692
00:48:47,167 --> 00:48:51,641
and each painting's equipped with a battery
operated magnetic sensor behind the frame.

693
00:48:52,083 --> 00:48:57,700
If it's moved, the detector sets off an alarm and
we're looking at like a six minute response time.

694
00:48:57,917 --> 00:49:00,867
And they send their alarm
signal directly to the cops.

695
00:49:01,375 --> 00:49:03,408
The whole thing's keypad controlled.

696
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:05,458
Oh, keypads, just call pops.

697
00:49:05,542 --> 00:49:06,542
Yeah, roger that.

698
00:49:07,208 --> 00:49:08,825
How good are security guards? How about that?

699
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:09,967
Five at night.

700
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:11,083
Top of the hour.

701
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:13,467
They do rounds on foot after they lock up.

702
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:16,317
OK, so what's the good news?

703
00:49:16,342 --> 00:49:17,442
Oh.

704
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:23,242
Here. Call in advance.

705
00:49:23,458 --> 00:49:26,000
Ask for Melanie. She will take good care of Will.

706
00:49:26,125 --> 00:49:27,783
- Where'd you get this?
- You know, it's online.

707
00:49:27,867 --> 00:49:30,133
It's a site like Yelp, but for hookers.

708
00:49:30,142 --> 00:49:31,542
No, no, no... forget it.

709
00:49:31,575 --> 00:49:33,533
There's got to be a better way than that.

710
00:49:34,342 --> 00:49:36,875
Well, if there is, you be sure to let me know, OK?

711
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:39,283
I mean though, what do you want him to do, Ray?

712
00:49:39,417 --> 00:49:42,000
Meet some girl, and take her out on a date.

713
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:44,417
Maybe fall in love, meet the family, and...

714
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:46,500
some day have sex.

715
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:49,958
In the back seat of the Buick,
on the banks of the Charles?

716
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,375
Yeah, Carl. I do.

717
00:49:55,583 --> 00:49:57,333
Alright. Thanks.

718
00:50:24,042 --> 00:50:28,908
Six parole violations and now he's
taking a minor to a whore house.

719
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:30,325
You know at this point, if...

720
00:50:30,792 --> 00:50:33,658
we don't fucking arrest him,
then we aren't doing our jobs.

721
00:50:34,625 --> 00:50:36,208
So, uh... this Melanie, she

722
00:50:36,292 --> 00:50:37,333
she's a friend of Carl's?

723
00:50:37,625 --> 00:50:38,625
Yeah.

724
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,200
You OK?

725
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:42,333
You got any questions?

726
00:50:42,792 --> 00:50:44,092
I don't think so.

727
00:50:44,292 --> 00:50:45,292
No?

728
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:47,367
Just remember what I said, you know.

729
00:50:47,417 --> 00:50:49,833
Wear your raincoat. No fancy stuff.

730
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,792
2C, 2D...

731
00:50:53,625 --> 00:50:54,750
2B. Here we go.

732
00:50:57,667 --> 00:50:58,667
Melissa?

733
00:50:58,917 --> 00:50:59,983
- Melanie.
- Melanie.

734
00:51:00,058 --> 00:51:01,475
Yeah. Come on in.

735
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,200
Carl explained everything.

736
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,117
So, you must be William. Hi.

737
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:09,317
Hi.

738
00:51:11,458 --> 00:51:13,492
We're fine. We'll see you in an hour.

739
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:15,750
OK.

740
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:17,567
- OK... good.
- OK.

741
00:51:17,585 --> 00:51:18,885
Alright.

742
00:51:45,708 --> 00:51:47,000
Will, open up!

743
00:51:48,125 --> 00:51:49,817
- Hey, what... everythings fine.
- Look, I'm sorry, we got to go.

744
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,492
The cops are here.

745
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,067
Look. Here's your money.

746
00:51:53,542 --> 00:51:55,792
They're gonna ask me questions, I cannot answer.

747
00:52:04,083 --> 00:52:06,117
I got this. Go, go, go.

748
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,000
Left. Left.

749
00:52:09,667 --> 00:52:11,458
Go up. Up, up, up.

750
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,883
Oh, fuck.

751
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:29,500
Dad-dad let's jump over.

752
00:52:29,583 --> 00:52:31,208
No, we can't jump. We're not jumping.

753
00:52:31,292 --> 00:52:32,750
Dad, what-what are you, scared?

754
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:34,375
You can't... you can't...

755
00:52:34,458 --> 00:52:37,691
- You don't think I can make it?
- Let me-let me find a fire-a fire escape.

756
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,175
Come on.

757
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:55,250
- Shit.
- Oh!

758
00:53:18,083 --> 00:53:19,692
A whore house.

759
00:53:22,333 --> 00:53:23,375
Why are you laughing?

760
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:26,058
Gramps. It's the coolest thing I've ever seen.

761
00:53:26,142 --> 00:53:28,717
Well, I bet it wasn't supposed to be.
Heh, heh, heh...

762
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:30,417
No, no, Gramps.

763
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:32,458
We jumped to a whole 'nother building.

764
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:35,583
On the top of the roof. And
then he picks the lock, and

765
00:53:35,767 --> 00:53:39,392
and I'm so nervous, my stomach's
just doing somersaults. But him...

766
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:41,580
He's just so calm.

767
00:53:41,581 --> 00:53:43,042
No, I wasn't calm on the inside.

768
00:53:43,167 --> 00:53:46,642
So, you never got... you never got to finish...

769
00:53:46,675 --> 00:53:47,875
Hey, pop, pop!

770
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:51,000
Why don't you go call Carl and
have him pick up the Buick.

771
00:53:51,083 --> 00:53:53,083
Alright. And then, then, then what?

772
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:56,583
Go walk the imaginary dog or
some other fucking thing.

773
00:53:56,875 --> 00:53:59,667
- If you want the time to be alone together.
- You're too much.

774
00:53:59,692 --> 00:54:01,416
Fucking take it.

775
00:54:01,417 --> 00:54:04,625
No need to patronize me, you... fucker.

776
00:54:04,833 --> 00:54:06,667
Oh, you're too much.

777
00:54:09,875 --> 00:54:11,000
Hey, Will.

778
00:54:11,292 --> 00:54:12,708
I'm sorry about Melanie.

779
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,317
You kidding me?

780
00:54:16,208 --> 00:54:17,208
Dad...

781
00:54:18,333 --> 00:54:19,792
today was awesome.

782
00:54:20,042 --> 00:54:21,967
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

783
00:54:31,208 --> 00:54:33,458
How come you broke up with that girl?

784
00:54:34,208 --> 00:54:35,708
- Tricia?
- Yeah.

785
00:54:39,917 --> 00:54:43,525
She would smile at every guy that walked past her.

786
00:54:43,617 --> 00:54:44,712
And it...

787
00:54:45,813 --> 00:54:47,867
it just, you know, it drove me nuts.

788
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:50,542
But that-that's it? She-she just smiled?

789
00:54:50,967 --> 00:54:53,042
She was trying to make me jealous or something.

790
00:54:53,043 --> 00:54:54,599
But... but...

791
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:57,383
what if she... is just friendly?

792
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:00,142
Why don't you just call her?

793
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:09,925
The kid. It's his son.

794
00:55:12,125 --> 00:55:13,425
William.

795
00:55:13,492 --> 00:55:17,166
Cutter took him out of school, the day
after he got out of prison. Ask me why.

796
00:55:18,375 --> 00:55:19,542
OK, why?

797
00:55:20,167 --> 00:55:21,167
Medical.

798
00:55:22,042 --> 00:55:23,908
William Cutter's got cancer.

799
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:25,800
Jesus.

800
00:55:28,167 --> 00:55:31,725
Lab test results on the trace heroin found
in the dead bartender's hotel room.

801
00:55:32,125 --> 00:55:34,992
Spoiler alert. Matches the shit you're after.

802
00:55:38,167 --> 00:55:39,333
OK. Um...

803
00:55:40,008 --> 00:55:42,382
Find out who granted Cutter's parole, and uh...

804
00:55:42,408 --> 00:55:43,917
give me Keegan's rap sheet.

805
00:55:44,642 --> 00:55:45,691
Please.

806
00:55:54,092 --> 00:55:55,292
Wow.

807
00:55:55,792 --> 00:55:57,292
What's the occasion?

808
00:55:57,333 --> 00:55:58,833
Here, sit down.

809
00:56:03,417 --> 00:56:04,767
Can't believe it.

810
00:56:07,833 --> 00:56:09,550
I figured out my third wish.

811
00:56:09,708 --> 00:56:13,217
- But you didn't get your second wish yet.
- It's alright. We can come back to it.

812
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,079
OK.

813
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,517
Lay it on me.

814
00:56:17,434 --> 00:56:18,434
Well.

815
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:20,000
I know you're planning something...

816
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:22,400
something to get the money to pay that guy back.

817
00:56:22,483 --> 00:56:24,442
- Gramps tell you that?
- No.

818
00:56:26,375 --> 00:56:28,125
Look, Will. You know...

819
00:56:28,208 --> 00:56:30,300
Dad. I want to help you.

820
00:56:32,458 --> 00:56:33,929
Getting you laid.

821
00:56:33,954 --> 00:56:37,116
And having you meet your mother... is one thing.

822
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:39,036
- But this is ain't your problem.
- Dad...

823
00:56:39,667 --> 00:56:41,208
you have this problem because of me.

824
00:56:41,292 --> 00:56:42,592
That is not true.

825
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:46,067
I was in the hole way before you came along.

826
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:47,950
But, dad, I...

827
00:56:49,292 --> 00:56:52,633
I-I've never done anything so
exciting as I did yesterday.

828
00:56:52,917 --> 00:56:54,042
And you and gramps...

829
00:56:54,383 --> 00:56:56,133
You guys have really lived, and...

830
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,400
I want to experience that, you know?

831
00:56:58,442 --> 00:57:00,900
Oh no. No, no, no...

832
00:57:02,042 --> 00:57:03,442
Trust me.

833
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:10,025
I don't... I...

834
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:14,083
I knew you weren't gonna follow
through with the fucking wishes.

835
00:57:14,092 --> 00:57:17,100
A-all you are... is a liar a-and a fake.

836
00:57:35,333 --> 00:57:36,633
Will?

837
00:57:39,667 --> 00:57:41,167
Will, open up!

838
00:57:47,792 --> 00:57:48,892
Hey.

839
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:24,383
Hi, pal.

840
00:58:32,292 --> 00:58:33,392
Hey.

841
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:36,800
What happened?

842
00:58:37,458 --> 00:58:40,208
The doctor said that y-you had a seizure.

843
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,608
I guess that's kind of normal for this thing.

844
00:58:45,417 --> 00:58:46,717
Hello, boyo.

845
00:58:58,458 --> 00:58:59,758
Dad, please.

846
00:58:59,917 --> 00:59:01,592
Please, please, please.

847
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,592
What is it you want, William?

848
00:59:07,792 --> 00:59:09,092
Please.

849
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
So this is Claude Monet, he's an Impressionist.

850
00:59:18,458 --> 00:59:23,792
The word came from the name of-of one of his
paintings, called the Impression Sunrise.

851
00:59:24,808 --> 00:59:28,625
He-he-he's not trying to be
exact like a photograph.

852
00:59:28,708 --> 00:59:30,808
A picture. He-he's trying to...

853
00:59:31,009 --> 00:59:32,564
Well, he's...

854
00:59:32,583 --> 00:59:34,342
he's trying to paint the feeling.

855
00:59:35,875 --> 00:59:37,400
Like Paul Gauguin?

856
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,700
Yeah.

857
00:59:40,292 --> 00:59:41,592
Like Gauguin.

858
00:59:41,851 --> 00:59:42,851
Yeah.

859
00:59:42,875 --> 00:59:44,125
It's a sunny day.

860
00:59:45,667 --> 00:59:47,625
It's, um... Spring time.

861
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:51,200
Camille is looking at Monet.

862
00:59:52,083 --> 00:59:53,292
And Jean...

863
00:59:53,417 --> 00:59:54,417
Wait.

864
00:59:55,583 --> 00:59:56,883
Who-who are they?

865
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,217
Camille is Monet's... Monet's wife.

866
00:59:59,417 --> 01:00:01,875
And Jean, is his eight year old son.

867
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,167
So, is it gonna be hard to fake?

868
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:12,500
Oh, no, you don't fake this.

869
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:14,500
I mean, you don't-you can't copy it.

870
01:00:14,501 --> 01:00:15,958
You-you have to...

871
01:00:15,983 --> 01:00:19,425
you have to get inside it... you know, it's...

872
01:00:19,833 --> 01:00:21,167
it's hard to explain.

873
01:00:23,792 --> 01:00:25,047
But if I could...

874
01:00:25,072 --> 01:00:26,357
if I could...

875
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:29,908
feel what he was feeling...

876
01:00:30,417 --> 01:00:32,667
you know, maybe... well, maybe I could do it.

877
01:00:37,167 --> 01:00:38,467
It's beautiful.

878
01:00:40,458 --> 01:00:41,758
It is.

879
01:00:41,917 --> 01:00:44,208
You ever gonna go to Tahiti, like Paul Gauguin?

880
01:00:44,458 --> 01:00:45,758
I don't know.

881
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:56,100
OK, you just keep grinding.

882
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,000
See all these minerals are pure.

883
01:00:58,042 --> 01:01:01,000
Like back in the day 1875, There
was no pollution, you know.

884
01:01:01,667 --> 01:01:04,908
Then, you know, factories came along and cars...

885
01:01:05,633 --> 01:01:09,633
They put little... like black
specks in the-the minerals, so...

886
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:13,783
well, you can't use that. That's
why I can't use my paints.

887
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:16,200
Let's see how you're doing there.

888
01:01:16,292 --> 01:01:17,292
Good.

889
01:01:17,333 --> 01:01:18,333
Now uh, OK.

890
01:01:18,458 --> 01:01:19,458
Some oil.

891
01:01:19,875 --> 01:01:20,875
Hold still.

892
01:01:22,268 --> 01:01:23,268
OK.

893
01:01:23,292 --> 01:01:24,708
Now, use this...

894
01:01:25,601 --> 01:01:26,601
Stir it up.

895
01:01:26,625 --> 01:01:29,408
- You want me to do it?
- Yeah. Go ahead, do it.

896
01:01:31,583 --> 01:01:32,583
- See that?
- Yeah.

897
01:01:32,601 --> 01:01:36,841
Yeah. And watch it become paint,
right in front of your eyes.

898
01:02:19,292 --> 01:02:20,292
Hey.

899
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,583
You take your meds?

900
01:02:23,417 --> 01:02:24,817
- Yup.
- Good.

901
01:02:30,792 --> 01:02:32,092
Hey, dad.

902
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:35,692
What you did today...

903
01:02:37,417 --> 01:02:39,142
it's pretty crazy.

904
01:02:41,292 --> 01:02:42,492
Thanks.

905
01:02:43,708 --> 01:02:46,292
Yeah, you know, I could've done it my whole life.

906
01:02:46,708 --> 01:02:48,008
Should've.

907
01:02:52,042 --> 01:02:53,442
Why don't you?

908
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,600
Let's get through all this.

909
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,517
Tomorrow we start fresh.

910
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,300
Alright.

911
01:03:09,375 --> 01:03:11,300
- Night.
- Night.

912
01:03:20,726 --> 01:03:21,726
Yeah.

913
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:24,825
Cutter's grant of parole was
signed by Judge Jacob Brooks.

914
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:28,283
<i>That's the same judge who acquitted Keegan
of his second felony charge back in 03.</i>

915
01:03:28,667 --> 01:03:30,583
So Keegan puts Cutter in prison...

916
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,825
and four years later, gets him out.

917
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,125
Why? 'Cause he feels bad?

918
01:03:34,208 --> 01:03:36,500
<i>Tommy Keegan doesn't know how to feel bad.</i>

919
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Yeah, Ray.

920
01:03:38,708 --> 01:03:40,275
She's coming right at you.

921
01:03:41,167 --> 01:03:42,467
Catherine.

922
01:03:43,583 --> 01:03:44,883
You want to talk?

923
01:03:46,167 --> 01:03:47,467
It's OK.

924
01:03:48,667 --> 01:03:50,167
We're alone.

925
01:03:50,458 --> 01:03:52,792
I mean it's OK for both of us.

926
01:03:52,917 --> 01:03:54,942
How'd you make me at Keegan's?

927
01:03:55,033 --> 01:03:56,333
I don't know.

928
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:58,125
You know, you were asking a lot of questions.

929
01:03:58,149 --> 01:03:59,249
So...

930
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:01,000
this is really about Tommy Keegan, right?

931
01:04:01,083 --> 01:04:02,083
Maybe.

932
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:04,392
Well, I can't tell you nothing about him.

933
01:04:04,792 --> 01:04:07,650
I mean, not that I care about him, because I don't.

934
01:04:07,725 --> 01:04:09,900
But, I'm not a snitch.

935
01:04:10,208 --> 01:04:12,833
- Never have been, never will be.
- Tommy Keegan was.

936
01:04:13,125 --> 01:04:14,950
Put you away for five years, huh.

937
01:04:15,025 --> 01:04:18,350
Keegan is in serious debt to the Arroyo cartel.
Do you know what that means?

938
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:21,683
- Have you seen this man before?
- No.

939
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
- You sure?
- Yeah.

940
01:04:23,208 --> 01:04:26,600
His name is Raul Carlos and
he's a real patron of the arts.

941
01:04:26,917 --> 01:04:28,500
Painting again, Ray?

942
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,500
I need time.

943
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:35,925
I need privacy.

944
01:04:36,292 --> 01:04:37,592
Because of your son?

945
01:04:37,618 --> 01:04:40,318
- Yeah.
- Look, whatever you think you owe Keegan...

946
01:04:41,717 --> 01:04:44,767
it's just gonna destroy the time
that you have left with Will.

947
01:04:46,167 --> 01:04:48,350
Help me to help you.

948
01:05:09,667 --> 01:05:10,967
You OK?

949
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,783
I just had a dream and...

950
01:05:25,533 --> 01:05:27,233
I'm here.

951
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:29,758
Come here.

952
01:05:44,917 --> 01:05:46,758
Dad, I'm scared.

953
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,300
I know.

954
01:06:14,292 --> 01:06:15,492
Hey, Ray.

955
01:06:17,333 --> 01:06:18,833
How we doing? Hmm?

956
01:06:20,333 --> 01:06:21,653
What the fuck are you doing here?

957
01:06:21,792 --> 01:06:23,683
I told you I'd get you the painting.

958
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:24,750
My goodness.

959
01:06:25,375 --> 01:06:27,042
Is that little William?

960
01:06:27,792 --> 01:06:30,300
Hey, you know what? You got
a phone call young man.

961
01:06:30,317 --> 01:06:31,908
Who's Tricia?

962
01:06:32,708 --> 01:06:34,417
- OK, go upstairs. Go, go, go.
- Come on bro,

963
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:36,708
are you getting some?

964
01:06:37,167 --> 01:06:38,825
He turned into a good looking young man.

965
01:06:38,875 --> 01:06:39,875
But he's uh...

966
01:06:40,226 --> 01:06:42,026
I don't know. Looking a little peaked.

967
01:06:42,125 --> 01:06:45,500
I told Finn I'll break his fucking
neck, if he came near my son.

968
01:06:45,583 --> 01:06:47,042
And that goes for the three of you.

969
01:06:47,125 --> 01:06:49,879
And stab him to death with a fucking
paintbrush, right? Why-why-why the hostility?

970
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Hostility?

971
01:06:51,333 --> 01:06:52,817
- Don't fucking move.
- Jesus Christ!

972
01:06:52,883 --> 01:06:54,875
OK, pop, it ain't that kind of night. OK?

973
01:06:55,292 --> 01:06:57,850
- Joe, come on, we're partners.
- Not with me, you're not.

974
01:06:57,875 --> 01:06:58,875
And this is my house...

975
01:06:59,208 --> 01:07:00,242
and I didn't invite you.

976
01:07:00,275 --> 01:07:02,717
Tommy, Tommy. Why don't you take Colin and Finn...

977
01:07:03,042 --> 01:07:06,217
tell them to wait in the
car, and-and we'll talk, OK?

978
01:07:07,242 --> 01:07:08,767
- Tomorrow's D day.
- Yeah, I know it.

979
01:07:08,850 --> 01:07:09,900
You ready?

980
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:11,195
- Yeah, no, it's not ready.
- Is it done?

981
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:12,290
But it will be done.

982
01:07:12,292 --> 01:07:15,383
The museum closes at 9:45. I'll
get it to you by midnight.

983
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:20,540
You can back that up, because I need
to have it at Copley by midnight.

984
01:07:20,625 --> 01:07:23,592
- You have it to me by eleven.
- F-for the-for the buyer?

985
01:07:23,956 --> 01:07:25,556
Mmm-hmm.

986
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:27,375
In person.

987
01:07:27,875 --> 01:07:30,033
And the appraiser. Fuck.

988
01:07:31,133 --> 01:07:33,996
The appraiser. You got the
contact number for that guy?

989
01:07:35,833 --> 01:07:37,167
How much is this gonna cost me?

990
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:38,575
How the fuck should I know.

991
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,983
I haven't done this in years.

992
01:07:42,333 --> 01:07:43,642
Fucking Minnesota.

993
01:07:44,192 --> 01:07:45,217
Jesus!

994
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:47,692
You're really in trouble
with this guy, aren't you?

995
01:07:50,381 --> 01:07:51,681
Shit.

996
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:54,700
Yeah.

997
01:07:58,083 --> 01:08:00,217
- Tomorrow night. 11 PM.
- Yeah.

998
01:08:20,917 --> 01:08:22,958
You should be so proud of Ray.

999
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:25,417
I-I, I know they're saying that...

1000
01:08:25,875 --> 01:08:28,042
he's a better dad than me.
I ain't saying anything.

1001
01:08:28,125 --> 01:08:29,625
But... but there it is.

1002
01:08:30,125 --> 01:08:31,250
And-and your grandson...

1003
01:08:32,083 --> 01:08:33,083
Well...

1004
01:08:33,542 --> 01:08:36,125
He's just as tough as you were.

1005
01:08:37,625 --> 01:08:38,625
So...

1006
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:41,583
When you meet him...

1007
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,375
take good care of him, will you?

1008
01:08:47,792 --> 01:08:49,850
I love you, that's a fact.

1009
01:08:59,208 --> 01:09:00,208
Yes.

1010
01:09:01,375 --> 01:09:02,675
Yeah, it's me.

1011
01:09:03,708 --> 01:09:05,008
Whose calling?

1012
01:10:28,833 --> 01:10:32,000
OK. Three 15 minutes bakes, five minutes apart...

1013
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:33,825
and 375.

1014
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:38,008
Think we're OK. The restaurant opens in an hour.

1015
01:10:41,333 --> 01:10:42,750
Well, you ready for this, boyo?

1016
01:10:45,167 --> 01:10:46,417
I'm just studying.

1017
01:10:46,667 --> 01:10:48,708
Yeah, good. Good, good.

1018
01:10:49,417 --> 01:10:50,857
Alright, you guys got any questions?

1019
01:10:50,917 --> 01:10:52,083
- Nope.
- No...

1020
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:54,950
Well...

1021
01:10:55,333 --> 01:10:57,367
I want to smoke these, uh... now...

1022
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
by a way of...

1023
01:11:00,083 --> 01:11:02,592
celebrating our coming success.

1024
01:11:03,708 --> 01:11:05,442
It's a sort of toast.

1025
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,525
Life is short...

1026
01:11:09,792 --> 01:11:11,300
and things go wrong.

1027
01:11:11,417 --> 01:11:13,175
May we always have enough.

1028
01:11:18,133 --> 01:11:19,433
He's here.

1029
01:11:19,467 --> 01:11:21,183
Just got pinged by ICE.

1030
01:11:21,417 --> 01:11:24,050
Raul Carlos and two of his
captains just flown into Logan.

1031
01:11:24,133 --> 01:11:27,167
Start with the top 3 hotels. Let me know
when you find out where he's headed.

1032
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:28,500
I'm on Cutter.

1033
01:11:28,583 --> 01:11:30,242
Get someone on Keegan.

1034
01:11:54,509 --> 01:11:55,509
Yeah.

1035
01:11:55,533 --> 01:11:58,333
<i>OK, so. Carlos and two captains
just checked into the Conway.</i>

1036
01:11:58,458 --> 01:11:59,458
Shit!

1037
01:12:02,042 --> 01:12:05,133
Whoa. Lady, watch out. This a
neighborhood, there's children here.

1038
01:12:05,158 --> 01:12:06,867
Sir, I need you to move your car. Right now.

1039
01:12:07,050 --> 01:12:08,942
Really, you're gonna pull a badge?
Like what, are you gonna arrest me

1040
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:11,217
- for pulling out of my driveway?
- Sir, move your car.

1041
01:12:50,458 --> 01:12:51,850
Sir. You can't have drinks in here.

1042
01:12:51,883 --> 01:12:52,883
Damn. What's that?

1043
01:12:52,967 --> 01:12:54,650
You can't... you-you can't have drinks in here.

1044
01:12:54,917 --> 01:12:55,917
Oh, I don't know.

1045
01:12:57,083 --> 01:13:00,000
- Sir, give me that sir. Give me the soda please.
- I'm thirsty, boyo.

1046
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:02,217
- Give me that. Give me that.
- The corridors are so long and such a long walk.

1047
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:04,050
- No, give me that. Give me that.
- Alright, let's go.

1048
01:13:04,108 --> 01:13:05,908
Let's go. Come on.

1049
01:13:05,932 --> 01:13:07,432
Let's go.

1050
01:13:18,867 --> 01:13:22,366
Thank you. Thank you. Yeah,
I was-I was leaving anyway.

1051
01:13:28,658 --> 01:13:29,748
Hey.

1052
01:13:29,773 --> 01:13:31,041
Sir, it's 9:30.

1053
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:32,883
We're closing in fifteen minutes.

1054
01:13:33,258 --> 01:13:34,458
Alright.

1055
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:36,992
You have to leave now.

1056
01:14:04,901 --> 01:14:05,901
Can I help you?

1057
01:14:05,925 --> 01:14:06,976
Federal police.

1058
01:14:07,001 --> 01:14:08,816
- We need to take a look around.
- Yeah.

1059
01:14:09,817 --> 01:14:11,125
Anything unusual?

1060
01:14:11,208 --> 01:14:12,208
No.

1061
01:14:12,583 --> 01:14:15,842
Just some old guy who spilled
a soda in the European wing.

1062
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:19,117
I gotta call Will.

1063
01:14:26,417 --> 01:14:27,908
- Hey.
- Will.

1064
01:14:28,167 --> 01:14:29,667
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

1065
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:31,575
We're moving. You got three minutes.

1066
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:32,967
Alright.

1067
01:14:38,083 --> 01:14:39,750
Hey. What's the score, guys?

1068
01:15:00,292 --> 01:15:01,875
Let me take that.

1069
01:15:20,792 --> 01:15:23,175
<i>- In the European wing.
- Show us.</i>

1070
01:15:23,458 --> 01:15:24,458
Sure.

1071
01:15:30,833 --> 01:15:31,833
Right here.

1072
01:15:32,667 --> 01:15:34,417
We already mopped it up.

1073
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:36,800
What did he look like?

1074
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,000
Just an old man.

1075
01:15:39,375 --> 01:15:40,875
A little demented.

1076
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,300
Sad.

1077
01:16:28,892 --> 01:16:30,292
Let's do a ride around.

1078
01:16:30,333 --> 01:16:32,167
Thanks, guys. Let's go.

1079
01:16:34,042 --> 01:16:35,242
Now.

1080
01:16:38,476 --> 01:16:39,476
Still on.

1081
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:40,500
Fuck.

1082
01:16:45,125 --> 01:16:46,700
What the fuck?

1083
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:20,542
Shit.

1084
01:17:22,766 --> 01:17:23,966
Shit.

1085
01:17:44,842 --> 01:17:46,392
The door is stuck.

1086
01:17:46,475 --> 01:17:47,908
Get the fucking flashlight.

1087
01:17:48,292 --> 01:17:49,458
Hit it. Hit it.

1088
01:17:53,375 --> 01:17:56,950
<i>Calling all units in the vicinity

1090
01:18:19,349 --> 01:18:21,549
Hey! Hey!

1091
01:18:21,792 --> 01:18:22,992
Stop!

1092
01:18:29,092 --> 01:18:30,392
Come on!

Go, go, go...!

1094
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,500
Holy shit!

So what now?

1102
01:19:08,208 --> 01:19:09,208
Now?

1103
01:19:10,333 --> 01:19:13,033
Now, Finn is gonna take this to the guy...

1104

along with this.

1105
01:19:15,583 --> 01:19:17,783
And I am off... the hook.

1106
01:19:17,842 --> 01:19:19,742
OK. What about me?

I don't see you anymore, right?

1109
01:19:23,167 --> 01:19:24,367
Not exactly.

1110
01:19:28,167 --> 01:19:29,467
Fuck you!

1111
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,600
I know you, Ray.

1112
01:19:35,583 --> 01:19:36,583
So.

1113
01:19:38,333 --> 01:19:40,158
After my man...

1114
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:43,300
gets out of town with that stupid fucking picture,

1115
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:45,150
I'm gonna make a call.

1116
01:19:45,225 --> 01:19:49,112
They're gonna take one look at whatever
the fuck it was, you put on that wall,

1117
01:19:49,153 --> 01:19:51,624
and they're gonna put you away.

1118

Again.

1119
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:58,492
So now, why don't you get up...

1120
01:19:59,792 --> 01:20:01,800
and get out the fuck out of here.

1121
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:11,583
- Yeah.
- Hey.

1122
01:20:11,642 --> 01:20:14,208
I got eyes on Finn Gerrity
walking into the Copley Plaza.

Jesus.

1124

- No. I got DEA in the lobby.

01:21:03,042 --> 01:21:05,075
Just let it play out.

1132
01:21:19,167 --> 01:21:22,217
Do you have the payment for Mr.Owensby?

1133
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:25,500
Yeah, I got the payment.

1134
01:21:34,592 --> 01:21:36,242
One hundred thousand dollars.

1135
01:21:37,417 --> 01:21:38,458
Yeah, it's all there.

1136

this guy comes all the way from, uh...
Minneapolis, Minnesota...

1138
01:21:45,542 --> 01:21:48,592
to tell me that Tommy Keegan is a fool.

1139
01:21:50,950 --> 01:21:52,242
What the fuck's that supposed to mean?

1140
01:21:52,325 --> 01:21:54,525
I always thought Mr. Keegan was stupid.

1141
01:21:55,042 --> 01:21:57,075
But I didn't know that he was this stupid.

1142
01:21:57,083 --> 01:21:58,925
Bullshit! Wait a minute.

1143
01:22:00,851 --> 01:22:01,851
Oh, what the fuck?

1144
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:03,583
Let's go visit Tommy Keegan.

1145
01:22:03,667 --> 01:22:04,667
Fuck that!

1146

1147
01:22:15,833 --> 01:22:18,042
- Uh, Mr... uh... Carlos.
- Carlos.

1148
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:20,967
I'm-I'm... sorry.

1149
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:25,950
Not only is this a... forgery.

1150
01:22:27,333 --> 01:22:29,150
It's a bad one, at that.

1151
01:22:30,842 --> 01:22:32,875
S-so it's worth nothing?

1152
01:22:38,683 --> 01:22:39,983
It's for you.

1153
01:22:53,883 --> 01:22:55,175
- Here they are.
- Oh shit!

1154
01:22:55,258 --> 01:22:56,342
No. Don't, don't, don't!

1155
01:22:56,625 --> 01:22:57,850
He's coming back.

1156
01:22:57,925 --> 01:23:00,716
OK, he's just gonna pay someone a visit.
He'll be back.

1157
01:23:01,083 --> 01:23:02,917
You don't have anything on him, anyway.

1158
01:23:05,208 --> 01:23:06,508
Can't wait.

1159
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Pop!

1160
01:23:26,158 --> 01:23:27,458
Geronimo.

1161
01:23:27,883 --> 01:23:30,583
- What did you do?
- OK. There's a painting upstairs.

1162
01:23:30,875 --> 01:23:32,767
It's a Monet. It's the real thing.

1163
01:23:32,917 --> 01:23:35,050
When they come back, you arrest them.
Read them their rights...

1164
01:23:35,166 --> 01:23:36,698
- Whatever you guys do.
- That's right.

1165
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:38,310
Wait a minute. Nothing was taken.

1166
01:23:38,333 --> 01:23:39,533
Trust me.

1167
01:23:39,542 --> 01:23:41,208
You just be very careful with the painting.

1168
01:23:41,292 --> 01:23:42,658
Bring it back to the museum.

1169
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:44,242
They'll know exactly what to do.

1170
01:23:44,333 --> 01:23:45,333
Yeah.

1171
01:23:46,667 --> 01:23:48,361
I thought you didn't snitch.

1172
01:23:48,386 --> 01:23:49,432
I don't.

1173
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,758
It's just this guy Carlos ain't from here.

1174
01:23:53,167 --> 01:23:54,708
We gotta go. OK.

1175
01:24:12,708 --> 01:24:14,000
Jesus!

1176
01:24:17,208 --> 01:24:19,308
Any sign of Finn Gerrity and Colin Corley?

1177
01:24:19,458 --> 01:24:20,800
No, not a trace.

1178
01:24:22,075 --> 01:24:24,825
It's been over an hour. Why is he taking so long?

1179
01:24:25,917 --> 01:24:28,217
When I was his age, two minutes, tops.

1180
01:24:28,542 --> 01:24:30,292
This is fucking ridiculous.

1181
01:24:36,792 --> 01:24:38,192
Goodbye, Tricia.

1182
01:24:51,583 --> 01:24:52,883
Hey, pop.

1183
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,125
Thanks for taking care of him when I was gone.

1184
01:24:55,208 --> 01:24:56,750
- Oh, stop it.
- Yeah, you know.

1185
01:24:59,292 --> 01:25:00,333
- Well?
- Hey!

1186
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,000
How did it go?

1187
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:06,040
Gramps, that's none of your business.

1188
01:25:06,417 --> 01:25:07,917
Alright, sergeant.

1189
01:25:33,750 --> 01:25:35,267
- Carl.
- Goodbye.

1190
01:25:39,333 --> 01:25:41,333
Bet he wishes he was going.

1191
01:25:41,917 --> 01:25:43,450
OK, here we are.

1192
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:46,500
Dad.

1193
01:25:47,008 --> 01:25:48,114
You sure, huh?

1194
01:25:48,139 --> 01:25:50,099
Yeah, this is the real thing.

1195
01:25:51,083 --> 01:25:52,383
Here we go!

1196
01:25:53,167 --> 01:25:54,467
Thank you.

1197
01:26:03,375 --> 01:26:05,800
- Have a nice flight.
- Yeah, thanks.

1198
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:07,550
Thanks.

1199
01:26:28,333 --> 01:26:30,367
I've never seen him this happy.

1200
01:26:42,042 --> 01:26:43,542
Hey, dad.

1201
01:26:45,167 --> 01:26:47,250
If you had one wish.

1202
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
What would you wish for?

1203
01:27:04,083 --> 01:27:06,708
<i>Come on in, you two pantsies.</i>

1204
01:27:09,208 --> 01:27:11,467
Join me. The water's fine, for Christ's sake.

1205
01:27:12,458 --> 01:27:13,858
Hey, Will.

1206
01:27:14,875 --> 01:27:17,792
What do you say we explore Polynesia, huh?

1207
01:27:18,083 --> 01:27:20,250
We go to... we go to Fiji,

1208
01:27:21,083 --> 01:27:22,458
We go to Tonga.

1209
01:27:23,250 --> 01:27:26,317
We go to Marquesas. That's where Gauguin lived.

1210
01:27:29,775 --> 01:27:30,975
We got time.

1211
01:27:31,467 --> 01:27:32,667
What do you think?

1212
01:27:33,775 --> 01:27:35,789
<i>Jump in and join me.</i>
