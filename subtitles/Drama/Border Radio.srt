<i>Timing and Subtitles brought by Love On The Air Team @ Viki </i>

2
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:58,120
I'm curious about you.

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,220
PD, why do you keep bothering me?

4
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,960
Just show me Lee Kang's que sheet.

5
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,970
Let's share some information. I'll look at it quickly and give it right back.

6
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,800
You said to hand over the plans earlier.

7
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,130
Ah, it doesn't matter. Whichever one works.

8
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,680
Hand over everything. Hurry.

9
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,890
-Why are we doing this Ji Soo Ho? Why don't we just say hi?
-Sh.

10
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,780
But look here, you look better since you've been working with Lee Kang.

11
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,710
Are you happy? I asked if you're happy?

12
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:35,700
Who's happy? I just want to kill him. I pulled an all-nighter yesterday too.

13
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,590
PD, you should've recruited me onto your team earlier.

14
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,130
I was so happy when I was on your team because I got to do nothing.

15
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,490
What are you saying you jerk?

16
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,510
I said to hurry and bring me the que sheet! Ah, really.

17
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,540
Hold on, it's in the booth. Wait here.

18
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,150
Okay, so is this the portion where we move onto the bridge?

19
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:04,830
Ah, yes. I underlined it with a highlighter.

20
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,170
What are you two doing here?

21
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,300
We're preparing for the broadcast.

22
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,080
From the crack of dawn?

23
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,170
Since I was helping Ji Soo Ho with this and that. And besides, they say that the writer and DJ are one.

24
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,430
Are one?

25
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,240
Also, could you write down the reactions I should be having on the script?

26
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,810
Huh?

27
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,700
What? They worked all night?

28
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,630
Our Ji Soo Ho was working so hard.

29
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:40,380
From the crack of dawn, he was looking over the script with Song Geu Rim.

30
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,420
-Does that mean that the two slept together?
-Hey!

31
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,960
What kind of nonsense are you speaking?

32
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,450
Song Geu Rim that girl. She's real provocative, that one.

33
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:56,500
But you guys know what they say right? Whenever you stay up all night in the booth, something always happens. Right?

34
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,260
Why are you trying to curse us with your superstition?

35
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:05,300
Hold on here, Song Geu Rim vs. Ra Ra Hui. Who do you think won when it came to viewership ratings?

36
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,020
It would be easier on us if Writer Ra Hui won.

37
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,420
Exactly.

38
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,820
I think Song Geu Rim won.

39
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,270
Of course we won, we have Mr. "Namaste" on our side.

40
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,200
Namaste.

41
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,030
Alright everyone, this was a special survey commissioned by KBC.

42
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,760
And the viewership ratings for the two programs are finally in.

43
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,190
But this graph line going upwards.

44
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:37,610
It this really our radio viewership ratings?

45
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:41,520
Alright then, is it 'Ji Soo Ho's Radio Romance',

46
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,020
or 'Let's Meet Jay at 6'? Who could it be?

47
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,510
-Ji. Soo. Ho!
-Yeah!

48
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,170
The team that lost in viewership ratings has to broadcast on Sundays too. Do you remember?

49
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:06,380
On this red day, you'll be stuck in a heated room and will have to work really hard.

50
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,960
Our team is going to go out to play.

51
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,000
Go ahead, go ahead.

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,460
Ah, and also we're going to start using Teacher Sung Woo's booth from our next live broadcast and onwards.

53
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,500
-What?
-Really?

54
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,750
Did you get permission?

55
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,130
-Namaste.
-Hey!

56
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:28,990
It's all good. Let's not do this again and just record one segment.

57
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,070
What recording?

58
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,810
Hey, hey, hey, hey you!

59
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,600
That jerk, I can't hate him.

60
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,100
But, where did Song Geu Rim go?

61
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,860
Who knows?

62
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,610
I hope it looks like this everyday.

63
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,430
Ji Soo Ho, what was it that you were saying?

64
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,790
You said you were curious? About what?

65
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:16,250
You said that to me earlier. "I'm curious about you."

66
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,630
Ah, that. That's--

67
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:30,440
Ah, really! Why do you always steal my food everyday?

68
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,580
Ah, really? Are you going to act that stingy maknae?

69
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,770
Here. You can eat all of this.

70
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,570
Thank you.

71
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:47,610
-But Ji Soo Ho, we placed first in viewership ratings.
-Oh really.

72
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:53,180
So today, we're not going to be broadcasting and have somewhere to go.

73
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,820
Everyone gather!

74
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,880
Are you really not going to come with us?

75
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,100
Ah, yes. Because I have a full schedule tomorrow and have to prepare for the broadcast--

76
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,990
But you have to be there Ji Soo Ho.

77
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:07,840
Why?

78
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,380
We're on our way to receive a PPL (produce placement), so we need your face.

79
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,590
I told you no.

80
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,600
Why can't we?

81
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,540
What kind of broadcast are you going to do in there?

82
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:31,200
Acting all sly. Did you think I'd let you borrow it if you brought Ji Soo Ho?

83
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,600
How great would it be if Ji Soo Ho broadcasted from your booth?

84
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,140
I'm telling you, our viewership ratings were through the roof.

85
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:42,990
That's right. And if Ji Soo Ho broadcasts in your booth, he can receive special training from you.

86
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:47,630
That's right. And if Ji Soo Ho broadcasts from your booth that'll mean he'll have to play all the records himself and I'll have less to do.

87
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,140
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:57,990
Ah, really. It was always my dream to broadcast from your booth, teacher.

89
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:03,070
If you lend us your booth, that means I've totally succeeded. Right?

90
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:07,820
You should give it to us as a "welcoming Ji Soo Ho to the radio" gift.

91
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,550
The booth of a living legend.

92
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:17,410
Why don't you say something Ji Soo Ho? Why do you want to DJ from my booth?

93
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,790
I don't really have any thoughts of wanting to do it there.

94
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,300
It doesn't matter to me, whether or not it's your booth.

95
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,240
All booths are the same.

96
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,090
I'll let you borrow it then.

97
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,300
What?

98
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,310
What?

99
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:51,030
I'll let you borrow it if you go mountain climbing with me every week.

100
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,330
What are you saying?

101
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:58,190
Since you said all booths are the same, I have to let you know how different each climb is.

102
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,770
Starting with your next live broadcast, use the booth.

103
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:07,910
Teacher, you promised us.

104
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,590
Yes!

105
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:26,350
Teacher, I'm rolling in betrayal right now.

106
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,570
What are you saying?

107
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:33,700
I mean, climbing a mountain together is something you do when you're on the third level of a best friendship.

108
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,020
Why are you already inviting Ji Soo Ho to the mountain?

109
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,820
He's cute.

110
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:43,900
He's a novice that doesn't even know how important the setting is to the radio. I've got to teach him a thing or two.

111
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,050
Ah, really!

112
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:51,530
Can't you teach me like that, huh?

113
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:10,920
The Ji Soo Ho effect is killer. Everything works 100% with you.

114
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,310
I'm good.

115
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:25,570
Well then, since we've received our setting placement, should we move on to receive our next PPL (product placement)?

116
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,300
Actually, I'll be heading out.

117
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,470
Then, let's do this.

118
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:47,400
We'll go by whoever throws it into the goal.

119
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,340
That's fine. What is this?

120
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:54,200
What do you mean "that's fine" in a world full of competition. Are you not confident in your athletic skills?

121
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,390
Yes!

122
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,820
This, this, this, this this, make sure you place it in the trash properly.

123
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,520
Where are you headed?

124
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:06,290
Shouldn't we give our listeners armfuls of gifts too?

125
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,010
I feel like I'm freezing to death. What gifts?

126
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:25,930
Excuse us.

127
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,950
-Hello.
-Hello.

128
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,070
You're the president of the Cheong Yoon Research Facility right? The one that sent his story to our radio?

129
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,920
I'm PD Lee Kang.

130
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:45,700
You were researching on how to restore youthfulness and glow into both men and women's skin, but you were rejected by both men and women.

131
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:53,140
You were the one that couldn't even eat ramen because of debt.

132
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:11,960
The hardships you go through during youth persist even when you're standing, are words I hate the most.

133
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,330
Even if I spend all night working, the only thing that adds up is debt.

134
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:19,690
The reality of my situation is that I can forget about looking for my own home  when I can't even figure out how to pay the next month's rent.

135
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,770
<i>Let's break up...</i>

136
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,760
The reality is that if you dream you become foolish.

137
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:43,050
There were a lot of foolish people like me sending in their stories to the radio.

138
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:51,340
But, I don't think I can live as a foolish dreamer anymore, since I'm all out of funding for my research.

139
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,970
I'm going to buy it. Your cosmetics.

140
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,050
Our program is going to.

141
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,640
Hey, you have the progression fee right?

142
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:07,230
Since we have Ji Soo Ho we could have so many sponsorships sticking to us at no cost, but why are we paying--

143
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,110
Ji Soo Ho and our program want to cheer on the youth.

144
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,300
We cheer you on!

145
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:17,150
We'll also be trying our best to promote your products to our listeners, through Ji Soo Ho.

146
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:26,220
And I heard this yesterday, but mistakes can become hits.

147
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,270
So don't give up. We support you.

148
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:32,180
-We support you.
-The individual that I'm currently in charge of,

149
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:37,180
is still refusing counseling and is struggling with chronic insomnia.

150
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,970
This individual since childhood, has never established real relationships with another.

151
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,630
And only created fake relationships in order to maintain a facade that is required in the viewable world.

152
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:49,440
He is both afraid of and rejects the idea of revealing his true self.

153
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,250
However, it has come to my attention that recently it was not a situation, but rather through a person,

154
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,180
that this individual has been making choices different to those he made in the past.

155
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:02,690
I will continue to monitor and observe these decisions and changes.

156
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,250
I guess you can't reach Ji Soo Ho at all now.

157
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,630
I'm aware of him being with the radio team.

158
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:14,330
Exactly. Soo Ho isn't one to fit in with others. But he's fitting in.

159
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,450
Isn't that strange?

160
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:18,970
However, I feel like this time around Soo Ho has opened up a little bit more--

161
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:25,090
Exactly! I'm saying that that's strange.

162
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:28,870
You understand what I'm saying right?

163
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,830
You may leave.

164
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,960
Yes director, I've sent Jin Tae Ri over.

165
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,220
Have you met with her?

166
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:43,770
Yes. Of course, I'm doing well.

167
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:51,910
But Jin Tae Ri, I never see you on TV ever.

168
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,350
Well president, it's not to the point that you'll "never see" me on the TV.

169
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:02,000
Do you think you're good enough to be in a commercial promoting our company's refrigerator?

170
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:09,170
If you ask me if I'm "good enough" to my face. Can I reply with of course,

171
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,710
I'm "good enough"?

172
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,020
Director, you should know better.

173
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:20,460
Am I "good enough" for your company's refrigerator commercial?

174
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,940
Of course, the rumors were true.

175
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:29,410
"Of course, the rumors were true," is being said by a bald-headed ahjussi (older man).

176
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,870
But what rumors are you referring to?

177
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:35,900
You really, aren't afraid of a single thing.

178
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:40,010
Since you're at the bottom of your career you're being called out to places like this.

179
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:45,420
At least I'm better than the scum that call out people like me to "places like this".

180
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,590
-What?
-It's true.

181
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:51,700
You dumbasses can't even seduce me, who's at the "bottom of her career".

182
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,090
This girl, really.

183
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,270
-Hey, do you think you're at our level?
-Hey, let go!

184
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:02,080
You're acting like you're a top star when you're the lowest of the lows!

185
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,100
Department head Kim? Why are you here?

186
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,330
Oh, this kid's under your management.

187
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,450
Am I your kid? Why are you throwing around that word?!

188
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,440
Can't you be quiet.

189
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,830
Come out.

<i>Timing and Subtitles brought by Love On The Air Team @ Viki </i>

191
00:16:55,630 --> 00:17:03,440

192
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,770
That cheap thing acting like she's all that!

193
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,060
Department head Kim, make sure you look after her well!

194
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,910
Kids like that always stab you in the back.

195
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:16,490
Yes, I'll offer you a drink.

196
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:33,600
But, director. Are you going to use our kid in your refrigerator commercial?

197
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,190
Are you crazy Department head Kim? Who would use something like that?

198
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:42,410
Exactly. If you're not even going to use her,

199
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:47,570
why did you hit her and pull at a girl's hair?!

200
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,790
I'll pay for your room. Then.

201
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:25,630
Ahjussi, so hurry up and give it to me.

202
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,730
I'm going to use Ji Soo Ho in whatever way I can.

203
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:38,950
I know about Ji Soo Ho's past and you have the evidence to back it up. Hm?

204
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:46,960
So, where are you going now Writer Song Geu Rim?

205
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,760
We have to head to the broadcasting station and probably stay up all night again.

206
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,580
And, this is the rewritten script.

207
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:03,030
I feel like this is the only thing I can do right now.

<i>Ji Soo Ho's Radio Romance</i>

209
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,900
Maknae, let's go.

210
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,600
Then Ji Soo Ho, we'll be leaving.

211
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:27,540
But, why do you keep calling Writer Song Geu Rim maknae again?

212
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,990
Isn't Writer Song Geu Rim the main writer?

213
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:33,520
There's another maknae writer now, so it gets confusing.

214
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:39,680
There's no reason to be confused, I only call Writer Song Geu Rim maknae.

215
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,690
And the maknae writer we have probably quit. I can't contact her.

216
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,400
But I would still prefer if you didn't call her maknae. She has a title as the main writer--

217
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:53,730
But you treat Song Geu Rim like the maknae too. Of course in a different way than I do.

218
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,430
What are you talking about?

219
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:59,070
You ignore all the scripts that she writes and send her on errands.

220
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:02,980
You treat our main writer like the maknae.

221
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:10,760
Then Ji Soo Ho, we'll head out and see you tomorrow. And until then, we'll be cohabitating.

222
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,150
Writer Song Geu Rim!

223
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,930
Could I talk to you for a moment?

224
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:28,160
I have a photoshoot located out of the city tomorrow.

225
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,360
Yes, I  heard that it ends at 2.

226
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,030
What if I'm late to the live broadcast?

227
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,540
What?

228
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,840
Since I can't be late. I'd like to use Article 4 of the Song Geu Rim contract.

229
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:47,730
<i>4. Song Geu Rim cannot say no to whatever Ji Soo Ho says</i>

230

<i>So I think you'll need to drive me tomorrow.</i>

231
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,060
Am I your personal driver?

<i>So you can drive safely tomorrow.</i>

234
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,870
I'll do what I need to do.

235
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:15,910
What if we lose in terms of viewership ratings again, even if we give out gifts like they're candy?

236
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,850
But isn't it weird?

237
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:22,840
How come JH is supporting us instead of her son?

238
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:30,340
Stop thinking of useless things and raise the viewership ratings. Viewership ratings!

239
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,010
You worked hard on today's broadcast too.

240
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,400
Are you making fun of me?

241
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,460
That's not it.

242
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:47,020
But what even if your role on that team?

243
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,030
Ji Soo Ho's planning team is writing all the scripts for you right?

244
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:55,200
Then are you a useless writer or a lackey writer?

245
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,370
Winning in terms of viewership ratings makes you think you did well right?

246
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:05,720
Making anyone the main writer is really humiliating me, really.

Ji Soo Ho, I really want to write a great script.

266
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:03,880
If I write well, you'll do the show with my script someday, right?

00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,290
Right.

But... aren't you offended?

272
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,340
Pardon?

273
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:28,450
Me not using your script for the show.

274
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,510
Well, I am a bit angry about it, but what can I do?

275
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:40,090
For you to use it, I have to write an amazing script for you.

276

But my circumstance is that I'm not able to write a script like that.

And now that I think about it...

Ah, I'm curious about something.

This is a personal question.

Why don't you carry a cell phone?

282
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:15,080
Why do I have to carry a cell phone around?

283
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,910
There's no reason for me to call anyone.

What?

285
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:21,900
Who would I call? I have no one to call.

Why don't you have anyone to call?

You have to call me, PD Lee Kang, and your manager.

290

And why aren't there anyone who'd answer your call?

When I want to ask you what you like and how you want to say it...

293
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:50,880
You can answer my call.

294
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,190
Ah, Ji Soo Ho. Can't you buy a cell phone?

295
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,790
And if I buy one?

296
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,370
If I buy one...

297
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,790
Will you call me every day?

298
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,870
What?

00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,810
<i>♬ Cause it's always a good time♬ </i>

309
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:51,670
<i>♫ Slept in all my clothes like I didn't care ♫</i>

310
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:55,500
<i>♫ Hopped into a cab, take me anywhere ♫</i>

311
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,560
<i>♫ I'm in if you're down to get down tonight ♫</i>

312
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,700
Okay!

313
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,580
We'll resume after we eat.

314
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:08,440
<i>♫  Good morning and good night. I wake up at twilight  ♫</i>

315
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,440
Yes, I'm in the area somehow.

316
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,800
Then can I come by and meet the idols quickly?

317
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:27,670
Ah, okay. I got it. Okay.

318
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:35,030
Ji Soo Ho, how many hours do you have left for you to finish shooting?

319
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:37,520
I have to go somewhere...

320
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,480
I'll take this car and will be right back.

321
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,490
You want me to get off the car?

322
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,300
Ready, start.

323
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:08,170
<i>♫ Hello, my cute friend ♫</i>

324
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:15,680
<i>♫  When the faraway ship horn blows,  ♫</i>

325
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:23,850
<i>♫ Cry without anyone else knowing. ♫</i>

326
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,890
Then is Sang Goo the only one graduating?

327
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,630
Those kids...

328
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:31,320
They'll be integrated to local schools.

329
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,940
There were two sixth graders, but Sang Goo alone got to graduate.

330
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,770
Where is Sang Goo?

331
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,050
Are you a reporter?

332
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:53,150
Stop coming around bugging me. Go away.

333
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,610
What did you say?

334
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,440
Are you here to write an article or something?

335
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,630
The reporters came by yesterday, too.

336
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:03,830
Hey, Sang Goo. I heard you're throwing a tantrum because you don't want to graduate.

337
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,750
Why are you doing that?

338
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:08,200
Why do you want to know?

339
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,430
Go. Go away!

340
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:15,150
<i>Why do you keep trying get cozy with me?</i>

341
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,270
<i>Why should I tell you that?</i>

342
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:19,520
<i>If you don't want to do it, don't do it and leave.</i>

343
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,660
<i>I said to go away. Please.</i>

344
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:28,020
Hey, you really resemble someone I know.

345
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,720
This is Gyo Min.

346
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,450
He's supposed to graduate with Sang Goo this time.

347
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:40,520
But Gyo Min will never be able to graduate now.

348
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:48,160
<i>I couldn't tell the kids. So, I told them he went to Seoul to receive treatment.</i>

349
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,250
I think they'd be extremely shocked.

350
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:55,850
But I had no idea he'd be waiting for him every day.

351
00:29:55,850 --> 00:30:02,860
<i>So, Sang Goo is insisting that he won't graduate until his friend comes back.</i>

352
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,720
Director, you received a call from the CEO, right?

353
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,690
What the heck?

354
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:19,160
Director, what's going on?

355
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,160
What do you think?

356
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,270
Get out.

357
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,590
Da Jin, I'm sorry.

358
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:28,860
The JH CEO asked us to change the content all of a sudden.

359
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,520
Are you kidding me?

360
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,970
Does this make sense? We're on a different level.

361
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,930
I guess you want to die, huh?

362
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:44,040
Hey, you! Why are you doing this with every little thing?

363
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,100
Why do you keep picking fights with me?

364
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,160
I don't like you.

365
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,280
You're not prettier than me and your acting sucks.

366
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,070
But I'm totally offended that you're so successful.

367
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,870
What do you want me to do?

368
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:01,330
If you're not doing well, there must be a reason.

369
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:07,560
Hoobaenim, I'm being extremely patient right now as you can see on my face.

370
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,730
I'm warning you. Shut up.

371
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,140
Are you kidding me?

372
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:25,550
Yes, CEO, the mood here is a bit...

373
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,140
Why are you doing whatever you want?

374
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,280
<i>You're the one who's doing whatever you want.</i>

375
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,990
You do the radio show the way want to... you cause the live broadcasting accident the way you want to...

376
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,580
So, I had no choice.

377
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:40,840
I'm in the middle of something urgent.

378
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,590
I'm hanging up.

379
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,620
Will it be okay?

380
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:53,150
You're already talked to Ji Soo Ho, right?

381
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,870
He's doing the radio show daily.

382
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,290
It's okay.

383
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,960
It's possible to do according to your schedule.

384
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:12,750
Over here, look.

385
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:15,220
Hold the beer up high, so we can see it well.

386
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,990
So sexy.

387
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:20,180
Soo Ho, look at the bottle.

388
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:22,310
Ah, nice...

389
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:25,090
Look over here. Look at the camera.

390
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:31,840
Okay. Good job.

391
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,630
Hey, Ji Soo Ho.

392
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,840
Why do you keep ignoring me?

393
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,020
Just think I must have a reason for ignoring you.

394
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,020
Couldn't you just ignore me, too?

395
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,660
Finally, Ji Soo Ho is speaking with me.

396
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,150
I guess my appearance today was quite shocking.

397
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:54,130
What are you going to do? Why are you like this?

398
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:57,250
Soo Ho, we have to be close from now on.

399
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,840
Don't be like that with me.

400
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,570
Acting all friendly towards you isn't even a hard job for me to do.

401
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:04,280
That's right. You received the grand prize for acting.

402
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,760
- Is that all you want?
- Huh?

403
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,720
This is the CEO's line.

404
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,820
"Is that really all you want?"

405
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:15,230
You two really seem like mother and son.

406
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,810
Right, Ahjussi?

407
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,880
Yes, of course.

408
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:35,460
I followed Ji Soo Ho to the shooting location. Don't worry.

409
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,620
Aigoo, aigoo, look at you talking.

410
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:43,900
You... stick by him and come together, okay?

411
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:49,240
I'm going to get Ji Soo Ho and get us back to Seoul. Don't worry, Director.

412
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,830
But, what about that rude, crazy PD?

413
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:57,060
- Is this your present for today's live broadcast?
- Yeah.

414
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:03,450
And, today, you're still only going to have Ji Soo Ho for two hours without a guest?

415
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:06,910
Mr. peer, don't try to win with idols or gifts.

416
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:09,830
Why don't you find the value of the radio instead?

417
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:13,420
Do you think you're the only one who's right about the value of the radio?

418
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:17,690
Then what about everyone else's thoughts? Are they all incorrect?

419
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:21,180
Why am I using idols? Why do I keep spending money? Huh?

420
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,310
Yeah.

421
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:28,940
How could it be that simple, the road to messing up the radio?

422
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,420
"Mess up?"

423
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:35,880
Hey. We have to bring in the teens and those in their twenties somehow. The world has changed.

424
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:41,280
Focusing on catering to those who like to listen to the radio now, what are you going to do about the future?

425
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:45,980
I'll borrow your words that you like to use frequently.

426
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:49,910
"In order for the radio to survive as long as the earth lives and breathes,

427
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:53,210
we need to bring in people in their teens and twenties, and make them admire the radio."

428
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:57,740
"This is all the content that you want." We have to do that.

429
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,380
- That's true.
- What?

430
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:05,310
I'm saying that you're right. I'm contemplate on that. Thank you, Mr. Peer.

431
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:09,310
Also, don't touch how that was set up, you punk.

432
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,650
We have to get going right now.

433
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:18,190
You can go first. I'm going to go with Writer Song.

434
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:20,490
Jin Tae Ri, you can go first.

435
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:22,800
Just ignore me instead.

436
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,240
Ji Soo Ho, get in.

437
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:54,860
<i>In Gangwon, Yeongseo, and surrounding regions there has been a notice issued for heavy snow fall, with many accidents due to this reason.</i>

438
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,050
Gosh, I'm going crazy.

439
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:02,560
<i>According to the weather station in Gangwon, snow clouds that developed in Seoul are moving towards other areas.</i>

440
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,070
<i>And in three hours, the snowfall will increasingly get heavier.</i>

441
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:09,960
<i> The snow will fall until the night.</i>

442
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,790
<i> Here is the next news.</i>

443
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:30,110
<i>Heavy Snowfall Alert
Seoul-Gangwon Route: Halted</i>

444
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:37,210
<i> Seoul, 125 KM</i>

445
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:39,230
<i> Be cautious of car accidents ahead</i>

446
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,180
Wow.

447
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:59,010
PD Lee Kang, what should I do?

448
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:04,420
I don't know if there's been an accident ahead or anything, but we can't cross the bridge or move an inch in this traffic.

449
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,260
So, you can't come?

450
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,400
What's it like, just let me know.

451
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,930
I can't guarantee it, but probably.

452
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:14,510
Hey, you guys have a recording set aside right?

453
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:18,740
You probably have at least one spare pre-recorded segment, right?

454
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:29,510
Hey Song Geu Rim, you told me not to worry about a single thing. You told me you'd bring him here no problem!

455
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:32,810
Yes sunbae, you can send us a truck from Choongcheon right?

456
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:37,840
Hey Song Geu Rim, do you really want to get fired?

457
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:47,970
Where did you say you were again? We're broadcasting today no matter what.

458
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:52,790
Do whatever you can to get to the nearest place that has transmission. We've done a lot of broadcasts on the move, right?

459
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,930
Come to your senses starting now. We're broadcasting with a truck today.

460
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,610
What about you?

461
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:06,690

<i>The opening and segment written about the Dongchon Branch school graduation.</i>

463
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,630
PD, I have a good idea.

464
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,790
Yes, PD-nim.

465
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:43,420
Alright maknae, like you said you'll be broadcasting from the school.

466
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:47,270
But you're fully responsible for everything there. Do you understand?

467
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:48,870
Yes, PD-nim.

468
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:54,430
Set everything up within an hour. The story you chose today was good, so trust in yourself.

469
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:58,080
And put Ji Soo Ho on the phone.

470
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:07,510
Ji Soo Ho, you told me not to call Song Geu Rim maknae, right?

471
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:11,240
You said you were a pro, right?

472
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,770
So, what are you trying to say?

473
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,980
Please treat Geu Rim as the main writer today.

474
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:30,900
We have to broadcast in the situation we're in right now, no matter what. There's no room for mistakes.

475
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:34,880
There'll be no mistakes on my end, so you should just look after yourself.

476
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,460
He's bothersome right?

477
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,370
Don't be nervous.

478
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,880
I'm not shaking because I'm cold.

479
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:42,130
Let me know what I can do right now. I'll do it.

480
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:48,590
Today, we have to do a live broadcast here, right?

481
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,440
Yes.

482
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,100
And us two, we'll have to do it on our own somehow.

483
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,170
Yes.

484
00:40:55,170 --> 00:41:02,240
Then let's wake up, calm our nerves, and do what we need to do.

485
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,630
Alright, what should be start doing?

486
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,330

487
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,570

<i>The 12th Dongchon Branch School Graduation Ceremony</i>

489
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:29,230
I have to write a script within the hour.

490
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:32,930
The segment is going to be about this school's graduation.

491
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:36,770
I ask you to please interview the last graduate, Sang Goo.

492
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:40,230
He's similar to you, so I think you guys will connect.

493
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,740
Aren't you going to stop me?

494
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,910
-Are you going to stop if I tell you to?
-No.

495
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,540
Then go ahead.

496
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,810
What are you? Why do you keep lingering around and following me.

497
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:57,180
You're on the same side as the woman with the poodle hair right?

498
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:00,560
You really are like someone I know.

499
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,660
What? I asked you to go.

500
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:06,680
You. Did you say stuff like that to your friend too?

501
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,690
What?

502
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:15,420
Did you tell him to go and push him farther away, because you wanted him to stay?

503
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,600

How do you know?

507
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:48,050
I know what that's like too.

508
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:52,040
But, he won't come.

509
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:58,190
Some people are just meant to never return.

You're here. Where's Sang Go?

515
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:14,430
He said he'd go first and wait. He must've gone to his teacher.

Sang Go came and found me, then asked for Gyo Min's address.

525
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:08,200
He was crying and asking where in Seoul it was. Then, he just left.

526
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,460
I thought he'd come quickly, but.

527
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:48,670
What should we do? We finished all of the script.

528
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:51,270
I don't think we'll be able to do the show. I'll let PD Lee Kang know.

Hold on. Let's look for him a little more.

530
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,060
Did you tell Sang Go about Gyo Min?

531
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:08,040
He left to Seoul to receive treatment, but he won't ever be able to return.

532
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:17,600
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that earlier.

533
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:23,290
But, "People who will not come won't come." That's right.

534
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:30,650
But, there are people who can't come even if they want to.

535
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:37,900
Someone told me this long ago.

536
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:42,470
"Not crying doesn't mean you're not sad."

537
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:47,350
"Like how laughing doesn't mean you're happy."

You are still small, weak, and young.

00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:59,460
If you keep holding back your tears and living like that, you'll turn into me.

540
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:13,180
He said he'd go to Seoul.

541
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:18,940
He said he'd come before my graduation.

542
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:23,950
He told me that he'd be back if I waited a little bit.

543
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:28,540
I told him to go. I said I wouldn't wait.

544
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:31,060
I told him that.

545
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:37,690
I thought he couldn't come because I told him to go.

546
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:45,460
That.. That really hurts my heart.

547
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:50,700
Do I have to keep waiting and not graduate?

548
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:57,640
Or, is it okay for me to graduate? I have to hear that from him.

549
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:03,510
Should I tell you how?

550
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:08,760
Ask him directly yourself.

551
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:12,120
How can I do that?

552
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:17,120

The murderer that I'm working with...

617
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:32,890
It looks like he'd fall into a relationship he's never experienced before... What kind of reaction would he have?

618
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:40,860
I'm so curious, myself.

619
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:43,000
You're curious, right?

620
00:57:56,230 --> 00:57:59,870
Where did that ahjussi go?

621
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:04,200
I wonder where he went. Maybe the bathroom?

622
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:08,690
But, when did you get so close to him? What's the secret?

623
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:13,580
He said he's the same as me. He wanted someone to not go.

624
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:19,970
He told them to go, too. Do you know who that'd be?

625
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:25,820
He said that people who will not come will never come.

626
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:31,580
He said all of that. It seems like he's waiting for someone.

627
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:36,460
Oh, and–!

628
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:39,810
You can go now.

629
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:53,260
I told you my number. When you get to Seoul, contact me.

630
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,900
Let's get going. You, too.

631
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:00,070
Are you telling me to go or not?

632
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,600
This time, I'm telling you to really go.

633
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,710
Congratulations on your graduation.

634
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:11,860
But, where should I hang this?

635
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:15,360
Where did you hang your graduation certificate?

636
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:19,200
I don't have one.

637
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:46,700
<i> Woo Ji Woo.</i>

638
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,240

639

640
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:17,860
I'm so happy.

641
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:25,640
I had a dream of leaving a trace, step by step, like this.

642
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,140
<i>♫ A hazy barely visible ♫</i>

643
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:33,390
Because you read my script today, I left all the traces of my dreams in it.

644
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:41,180
To those who listen to the radio, it was a stamp for the first time.

645
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:47,730
Thank you, Ji Soo Ho.

646
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:50,460
There's something I'm really curious about.

647
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:51,620
What is it?

648
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:54,850
The thing you said earlier.

649
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:59,360
"Not crying doesn't mean you're not sad."

650
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:02,870
"Like how laughing doesn't mean you're happy."

651
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:07,780
I really like that saying. Where did you hear it from, Ji Soo Ho?

652
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:11,430
