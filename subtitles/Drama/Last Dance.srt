1
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,400
-= Last Dance =- 

2
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,000
With no warmth inside
we surely will shiver

3
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,000
So we sleep
We sleep so satisfied

4
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,200
Lay down, lay down, lay down
Down and feed

5
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,680
Lay down, lay down, lay down
Down and feed

6
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,000
Lay down, lay down, lay down

7
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,880
And feed the fire

8
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,840
Lay down, lay down, lay down
Down and feed

9
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,680
Think I'm lost
with all your promises

10
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,720
Think I act strange
when you talk to me

11
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,280
Oh, that's gonna kill you.

12
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,920
...represent concepts.
Now, what you're...

13
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,960
I'm sorry. Could you tell me where
the chief of staff's office is, please?

14
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,240
- Sure. Up the stairs and to your left.
- Up the stairs. Thanks.

15
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,200
The one nearest the front door
at the crossing represents justice.

16
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,920
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I'm Rick Hayes.

17
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,360
- I'm here to see John Hayes.
- Oh, you're John's brother.

18
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,120
Yeah, among other things.

19
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,480
- Louise, John's brother is here.
- Okay.

20
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,400
- He's right here in the conference room.
- Great.

21
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,320
We should take each case
on its merits.

22
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,440
Now, we have restricted
out-of-state travel...

23
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,880
and we've delayed the purchase
of new state vehicles.

24
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,880
It doesn't sound like enough.
We have to trim ten million...

25
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,480
from department spending over
the next fiscal year. John?

26
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,960
I've requested the department trim
five percent across the board,
except for education.

27
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,520
Okay. But we're gonna have to
find some additional measures.

28
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,760
Cutbacks? With an election
next year, it might...

29
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,520
You want the tooth fairy to come,
you're gonna have to put some teeth
under the pillow.

30
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,400
Agreed. With what we've done,
we're now in a position to take stock...

31
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,400
make our judgments regarding
the staffing and expenditures...

32
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,200
and we will take a long, hard,
critical look at all...

33
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,080
I'm just trying to figure out what kind of
idiot shows up his first day of work...

34
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,320
late and stinking of wine.

35
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,560
I guess now you know.

36
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,120
You wanna try to explain
your resume?

37
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,400
- What do you mean?
- Well, you went to law school.
Did pretty well.

38
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,560
Worked for Hayes Development for
three years. Working for your old man?

39
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,480
- On and off.
- Mmm.

40
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,120
And then there's this gaping hole.

41
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,080
What have you been doing with
yourself for the last two years?

42
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,160
Well, my father passed away. Maybe you
know. I helped settle his affairs.

43
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,880
And after that?

44
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,320
Um, well, after that I, uh, I did
some travelling and I, I just
tried some different things.

45
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,360
Partied for two years.

46
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,880
Well, call it what you want.

47
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,840
Okay. What do you want to do?

48
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,640
- What do I wanna do?
- Hell, it's your call.

49
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,320
Your brother's
the governor's chief of staff.

50
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,560
Well, um...

51
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:06,880
Well, while you think about it, I'll get you
a desk and a subscription to Playboy.

52
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,520
Of course, if you're interested in actually
working, I'm up to my butt here.

53
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,400
Yeah, I'd like to give it a try.

54
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,640
You know anything about this office?
You know what clemency is?

55
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,960
Yeah, it's the power to pardon
people, commute sentences.

56
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,520
- Whose power?
- I believe, the governor's.

57
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,280
In this state, his sole power.
He makes the final decision.

58
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,880
The Clemency Office makes
recommendations, but we're not here
to retry the case.

59
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,600
This is about mercy.
Has the prisoner rehabilitated himself?

60
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,280
Will solid citizens
speak out on his behalf?

61
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,680
Does his own mother
have anything good to say?

62
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,120
- Will I get some kind of training for this?
- Yeah, by doing it.

63
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,800
Well, this is it...
124 pending cases.

64
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,280
Everything from tax fraud
to murder.

65
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,240
Wow. How do you keep on top
of all of it?

66
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,800
You don't. You prioritize.

67
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,440
I've got death warrants
coming down any day.

68
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,880
Obviously they come first.

69
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,680
Every time a death warrant is issued or
reissued, we have to make a new report.

70
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,440
- You know anything about John Reese?
- Uh, yeah, John Reese.

71
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,120
That's the cop killer who pleaded
self-defence, right? I saw him
on 60 Minutes

72
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,040
Right. Yeah. Big celebrity.
Even wrote a book.

73
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,400
Every time I see him, he gives me one.
Couldn't get through the damn thing.

74
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,400
- Well, great. I'll take Reese.
- No, I've already got that one started.

75
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,360
Take Cindy Liggett.
Look through her file.

76
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,040
- It's a death penalty case?
- Yep.

77
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,680
- Get your dick wet with Liggett.
- Okay.

78
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,520
Helen'll get you a desk and a Playboy
if you change your mind.

79
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,800
- Slow down, slow down.
- All right.

80
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,880
Are we there?

81
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,280
All right. Okay.

82
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,760
Well, what do you think?
It's not bad, huh?

83
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,120
Bedroom, bathroom,
office area up there...

84
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,080
and gourmet kitchen
and swimming pool.

85
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,160
Never know who you'll meet
down there.

86
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,320
- And I got you into the tennis club.
- What's this?

87
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,160
- Oh, you'll be needing that.
- I got a tux.

88
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,440
It's an Armani.

89
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,440
I thought the days of profligate
spending were over, John.

90
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,840
Oh, don't worry about it. You're in the
majors now, you gotta look the part.

91
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,560
Okay. Thanks.

92
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,720
Ah, don't look like somebody
slammed your nuts in the door.

93
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,640
- It's... It's gonna be good.
- I know.

94
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,240
- Wait and see.
- I know.

95
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,760
Listen, it doesn't mean
the party's over.

96
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,680
It's just a better class of guests.

97
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,720
Well, you know, her crimes, you don't
think of a woman committing
a crime like that.

98
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
I mean, I don't, anyway.
That... That brutal.

99
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,760
Most of the time a woman kills,
it's a crime of passion.

100
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,680
Usually her husband
or her boyfriend.

101
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,160
And last time she got a stay of execution
with about four days left.

102
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,360
- Well, when was that?
- About 18 months ago.

103
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,440
It's all a delaying game, really.

104
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,720
They come up with some new
constitutional theory...

105
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,320
and find a sympathetic judge to grant
a stay, then they start appealing
all over again.

106
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,680
Right, and they just
stretch it out indefinitely.

107
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,040
Well, no, not this time.
It looks like she's run out of arguments.

108
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,280
- And a lot more women
are gonna be executed now.
- Why's that?

109
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,080
Women's lobby. They all want equal
treatment in the eyes of the law.

110
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,760
- Hey, Frances, what's up?
- Where you goin', girl?

111
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,200
What's goin' on?

112
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,480
- Hey, Frances!
- I'll tell you something now.
Don't be like that, Frances.

113
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,200
- Frances!
- Hey, Cindy, you checkin' out
of death row?

114
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,880
- You don't like it here?
- Hey. Hey!

115
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,600
...somebody. He don't need
to know my personal life.

116
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,120
I have my own life, and just because I have
a kid don't mean my life needs to stop...

117
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,040
and I need to stop
what I need to do.

118
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,000
She ain't the only one raising him.
The father raises him too.

119
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,680
Oh, yeah. On the weekends he...

120
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,520
And that's my business.
That's my time now.

121
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,840
How 'bout self-respect?

122
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,520
Every dollar you have, these sweet
and innocent-looking girls...

123
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,760
shamelessly tell us
they are money hungry and...

124
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,440
I'm Rick Hayes. I'm with the Clemency
Board. Would you like to have a seat?

125
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,320
I'm gonna be working on your report,
the update, so we need to...

126
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,600
- No.
- No?

127
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,560
No, we don't need
to do anything.

128
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,720
- Well, what do you mean?
- I'm not playin' your game.

129
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,560
Um, l...
Well, I don't understand.

130
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,000
It's one big, sick fuckin' joke.

131
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,280
- How's that?
- This governor doesn't give clemency.

132
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,400
Well, uh... What is it
that you're saying here?

133
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,040
I'm saying you go ahead
and you make your damn report...

134
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,080
then you give it to the governor and you
let him give it serious consideration...

135
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,800
then you can all go ahead and
kill me with a clear conscience.

136
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,800
Miss Liggett, maybe you can explain
to me... what is it that you have to lose?

137
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,960
I mean, there is really no good
reason for you not to cooperate.

138
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,360
Just give us something we can work with
here. There's gotta be a...

139
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,640
I'm very, very proud of my 17-year-old
'cause she works and goes to school...

140
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,880
What'd you say your name was?
Rick?

141
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,280
- Right.
- What's that short for?

142
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,520
- Eric? Richard?
- Richard, yeah.

143
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,720
- Mm-hmm. So, what's wrong
with Richard?
- What's wrong with Rick?

144
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,040
Every Rick I ever knew was a slick,
two-faced motherfucker.

145
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,440
- I know quite a few.
- Well, you just met one who isn't.

146
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,120
That's the first thing every slick,
two-faced motherfucker tells you.

147
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,080
All right, Miss Liggett.

148
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,920
Frances.

149
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,920
Wanna know what the second
thing they say is?

150
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,120
What do you got to lose?

151
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,640
- You should really think about this.
- I have.

152
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,560
For about 12 years.

153
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,200
You take care of yourself, Rick.

154
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,480
Gotta bust out some cash, anything.
I don't care what it is.

155
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,200
- What kind of presents do you get?
- Gold.

156
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,120
I got a bedroom set,
a TV, stereo...

157
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,800
- You got a bedroom set?
- Mm-hmm.

158
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,120
- Did your mom ask you where
it came from?
- No.

159
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,280
Well, we don't need
her cooperation anyway.

160
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,640
- What do you mean?
- The report's required, with or without it.

161
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,680
Oh, man, she is a pisser.

162
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,880
- Sounds like she sure as hell
had your number.
- Yeah.

163
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,000
- Rick, come on.
- Hey, John.
- Hey, Emerson. How are you?

164
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,240
- Hi.
- Lobbyist.

165
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,160
- For what?
- Oil companies.

166
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,800
Oh.

167
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,320
- The Brothers Hayes.
- Governor.

168
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,360
- John.
- My brother Rick.
- How are you, sir?

169
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,280
- Rick. Of course.
- Yes.

170
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,200
- Mrs Governor.
- Tom.
- Nice to meet you.

171
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,120
In the governor's business
we call this a "meet and greet."

172
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,280
Well, it wouldn't be hard
to get used to.

173
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,560
Bart, stay right where you are.
Don't have too much fun now, fellas.

174
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,360
The guy's in perpetual motion.
He's incredible.

175
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,600
Hey, you know, I've been glancing at the
files. He's never granted clemency, huh?

176
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,800
- No, not true. No. We've granted
15 pardons since I've been here...
- Yeah?

177
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,720
- And scores of sentence reductions.
- Never in a capital case.

178
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,920
No, not in a state where 76 percent of
the voters favour the death penalty.

179
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,200
Well, then why the hell did you
put me in a goddam useless job?

180
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,720
Oh, I figured if you messed up,
you couldn't do much damage.

181
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,120
Well, you're just a condescending
son of a bitch. Why is that?

182
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,560
- Oh, relax. Listen.
- No, no, I'm...
- If things work out...

183
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,200
- Hi there, you guys.
- There's an opening in the press office,
the first of the year.

184
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,840
- Ladies, ladies!
- Rick, this is my friend Jill Venable.

185
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,360
- And Jill, you know John, of course.
- Everyone knows John, of course.

186
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,600
- Hi, Jill.
- Hey, yeah, I know you.

187
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,480
- You used to live down the street from us
on Oakmont, right?
- That's right.

188
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,160
- She's almost the girl next door.
- That's sounds terrible.

189
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,320
- I don't remember you being so cute.
- Oh, well, thanks.

190
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,560
- I've been working on it.
- Well, it sure makes my job a lot easier.

191
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,880
- Your job, huh?
- Yeah, I'm supposed to take you around...

192
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,680
and introduce you to people
of power and influence.

193
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,000
Oh, I see. Big brother's
looking out for me again?

194
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,880
Oh, we can start with a few corrupt
committee chairmen,
work our way down.

195
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,400
Ah, none of that. Let's get a couple
of drinks and have a chat.

196
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,480
- Do you think your parking space
could've been further away?
- That's what I said. The...

197
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,800
- Is this it?
- Yeah, it's right here.

198
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,440
- Ohh. John must have found
this place for you.
- How could you possibly guess?

199
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,920
'Cause he's been here seven years
and still rents his furniture.

200
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,120
- We used to go out.
- Oh?

201
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,240
We're just friends now.
My decision.

202
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,400
I haven't had a chance to stock the bar
or unpack glasses, but I got some beer.

203
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,440
Great.

204
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,400
Haven't even had a chance to unpack
the stereo, unfortunately.

205
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,000
No drinks, no music.

206
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,120
How do you expect to make
any progress?

207
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:21,600
Well, l-I don't know. I guess I'll, uh, just
have to rely on some personal charm.

208
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,560
You might be in trouble.

209
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,880
Well, I could hum something.

210
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,880
What would you like to hear?

211
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,840
How about Beethoven's Ninth?

212
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,240
- That's a lot to ask on a first date.
- Well, I expect a lot.

213
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,680
Sorry.

214
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,600
My God, what is that?

215
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,040
I'm sorry. This is a case
I'm working on.

216
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,760
What's the matter, you don't come across
stuff like that in Consumer Affairs?

217
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,680
Uh, no.

218
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,640
- You got that?
- Okay, go on.

219
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,440
Write him I'm looking forward to when
he's on leave from the Marines...

220
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,400
so he can take me to that club
he wrote me about...

221
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,800
that Waikiki bar
in Honolulu, Hawaii.

222
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,440
- Hey, slow down.
- Honolulu?

223
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,480
- Child, what you talkin' about?
- Your pen pal said he's gonna
take you to Hawaii?

224
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,000
He's stationed in Korea, girl.
It ain't that far to go.

225
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,720
He said he gonna marry me
and have a big party there,
cause he know the owner.

226
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,400
Oh, yeah?
You're so full of shit.

227
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,040
- Did you tell him about
your other husband?
- Bitch, shut up.

228
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,480
Meet... you... in...
Honolu...

229
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,360
Is that two O's and two U's?

230
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,840
- I'm right here for you, girl.
- Let's just finish the letter.

231
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,520
Go on!

232
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,040
- Sam, good morning.
- Good morning.

233
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,600
Um, look, l-I've been
looking at this Liggett file.

234
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,040
L-I'd like to go back and see if
I can get her to work with us.

235
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,720
Oh. So now it's
a matter of pride, huh?

236
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,120
No, no, no, I just... I think it's the only way
we're gonna get anything new.

237
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,800
You're wasting your time, Rick.
You've got two dozen people
to reinterview for the update.

238
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,720
But they're all gonna say
the same thing, no?

239
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,920
You're not gonna get anything
out of Liggett.

240
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,760
She's making her stand.
I've been through this before.

241
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,520
Well, Sam, I'd at least
like to try.

242
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,360
Of course you would.
Everyone does the first time.

243
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,280
It's called
the rescuer syndrome.

244
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,920
That's great. I'm on the job three days,
I got a syndrome.

245
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,720
She won't deal with you. They served
her death warrant last night.

246
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,840
Execution's in 30 days.

247
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,000
- I got five more minutes.
- Visitor.

248
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,200
- Today?
- Someone from Clemency.

249
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,360
- Tell him I don't wanna see him.
- Hey, I'm not your social secretary.
Come on.

250
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,400
You know you are.

251
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,120
This is your last clemency report.
Open it up, take a look.

252
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,360
No, huh? I'll do it for you.

253
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,480
You just look at the cover page, okay?
That's all. Just the cover page.

254
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,120
You see what it says under
"recommendation"? "Deny clemency."

255
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,120
- I can read.
- Yeah? Well, that might as
well read "Let's kill her."

256
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,320
Now, you know why it says that?
Because you ain't give 'em anything.

257
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,480
- They had nothing to work with.
- How long you had this job?

258
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,280
Four days.

259
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,560
So basically,
you don't know jack shit.

260
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,200
That's right. I don't know why you're not
a good candidate for clemency.

261
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,080
Now, maybe if I had more experience
I'd just give up and write you off as well.

262
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,880
You probably think you know
everything about me.

263
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,200
I know what's in that file.

264
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,360
Look, even if I get clemency...

265
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,240
it means life in here with no parole,
and that's no life.

266
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm not beggin' for mercy
I'm not gonna get.

267
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,600
You think I wanna die?
I do not wanna die. Okay?

268
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,920
- Well...
- But if I do, it's gonna be on my terms.

269
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,320
You got that? My terms.
That's all I got.

270
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,000
Frances!

271
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,280
They know how to harness Negroes
down south too, I hear.

272
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,680
With a strap across their back.
Come on.

273
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,480
Mmm. Hmm.

274
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,760
Get out of my house. Get out
of here, you thievin' whore!

275
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,160
Get out of my house, damn you!

276
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,200
Hey! What the fu...

277
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,160
Cindy!

278
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,600
Reg? Reggie?

279
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,240
Reg, you awake?

280
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,520
Reg? Reg?

281
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:42,120
Untamed youth with one thing on
their minds... Barq's Root Beer.

282
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,120
I know that you were
involved in her appeals.

283
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,200
That's right, and I assisted
Ed Duffy at the trial.

284
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,200
Listen, maybe we should
talk later. I got a hearing.

285
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,840
Just a minute. Is there anybody
else I should be talking to?

286
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,560
Her only family's a kid brother. It's been
a defence nightmare from day one.

287
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,720
- That's because of the brutality
of the crime.
- That, yeah.

288
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,280
And we only had nine days
to prepare for trial.

289
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,520
Well, now, the girl... she, in
fact, knew her in school, yes?

290
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,440
Yeah. And the boy was the son of none
other than of William J. McGuire.

291
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,400
McGuire? What, construction?

292
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,080
- Yeah. Hey.
- Hi, Linda.
- Listen.

293
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,600
McGuire wanted her to get the death
penalty, and he lobbied like hell for it.

294
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,560
- Huh.
- Listen, she got a tough break.
- Is there...

295
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,400
But it wasn't like she would've
ever gotten the sympathy vote.

296
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,280
Is there anybody out there with
anything good to say about her?

297
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,120
Nobody I'd let
baby-sit my child.

298
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,280
- You again.
- Me again.

299
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,160
- Well, it gets me away from the TVs.
- TVs?

300
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,120
Well, they got those TVs
down in the pod...

301
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,480
blastin' game shows
and soap operas all day long.

302
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,840
That's what I'd call cruel
and unusual punishment.

303
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,920
Yeah. No question.

304
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,880
Guess they figure by the time they get
around to killin' you, you'll be grateful.

305
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,600
Well, I'm just glad you consider me
a notch up from that kind of torture.

306
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,560
Just a notch.

307
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,200
What do you want?

308
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,520
Well, let's start with
some names, okay?

309
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,480
Anybody out there with anything
good to say about you?

310
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,480
When I was out in the free world,
there wasn't anything good about me.

311
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,560
- You could talk to Reggie.
- Oh? Who's Reggie?

312
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,520
She's my cell neighbour.
She killed both her husbands.

313
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:23,320
By the time they were about to arrest her,
she was just about to marry
number three.

314
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,840
Well, she... she might not make
the best character witness, uh...

315
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,080
- What about your brother?
- Billy?

316
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,120
I know he thinks I hate him,
but I don't.

317
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,960
I just wasn't a very good sister.
I was runnin' wild.

318
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,720
- Is he still in St. Charles?
- Last I heard.

319
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,280
He's almost 22.

320
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,640
His birthday's in April.

321
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,400
Were you close?

322
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,920
Well, we had different fathers.

323
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,760
Neither one of us knew 'em.

324
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,400
After my mama died,
it was just us.

325
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,120
Yeah, you were, uh, what, 16?

326
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,760
Yeah. She died two days
after my 16th birthday.

327
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,680
What was she like?

328
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,960
Pretty. Wild.

329
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,320
When she was feelin' good,
she could be a lot of fun.

330
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,640
She wasn't like
anybody's mama I knew.

331
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,080
We were more like sisters,
I guess.

332
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,840
She just couldn't stay clean. I guess
she passed that on to me.

333
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,320
Now, what is it
you're drawing there?

334
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,680
Oh. Well, sorry I asked.

335
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,480
It say in my file
I take drawing lessons?

336
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,000
- No, I don't think so.
- I do.

337
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,240
Through the mail.
Helps me pass the time.

338
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,920
You know, and every week they
give you something new to draw.

339
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,880
This week it's castles.

340
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,160
Takes me away.

341
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,720
Do you think you could get me
a picture of the Taj Mahal?

342
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,000
- Yeah. Why?
- I wanna draw it.

343
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,120
Taj Mahal? I expect that's
not too easy to draw.

344
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,080
Well, I got 23 and a half hours
a day to get it right.

345
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,560
No. No, hold our table.

346
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,560
We are on our way.

347
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,000
- Order a good bottle of red.
We'll be there in ten.
- No, Johnny, l...

348
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:39,120
- The ladies are not happy.
- You gotta apologize for me, cause I gotta work tonight.
- Aw, come on.

349
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,360
No, no, no, I been going through
the transcripts from the Liggett trial,
and listen to this...

350
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,160
- Sam gave you Liggett?
- Yeah. He's got that guy Henry Reese.

351
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,760
Well, Liggett shouldn't keep you that
busy. It's a pretty open-and-shut case.

352
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,160
- No, no, not necessarily.
- Huh? Well, it always
seemed that way to me.

353
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,760
- Yeah, but...
- And I'm familiar with the case.

354
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,480
No. L-I found this
police report, right?

355
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,240
Her brother said that she and her
codefendant had been up for two days...

356
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,840
smoking crack
and robbing houses.

357
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,480
At the sentencing hearing, her lawyer
doesn't say word one about drugs...

358
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,960
or intoxication or even a possible
lack of premeditation.

359
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,880
Well, that's a judgement call.

360
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,600
Yeah, but when juries vote to execute,
the key issue is intent.

361
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:12,360
I mean, was this murder intentional?
Was there a reasonable expectation
that death would result?

362
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,360
I was a prosecutor.
I know the law.

363
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,080
Well, then why didn't the lawyer use it?
'Cause this girl was blasted
out of her mind.

364
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,000
It would've at least raised
a doubt with the jury.

365
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,920
- Does it make it a clemency issue?
- No, not technically.

366
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,400
Then stay within the guidelines
of your office and wrap this one up.

367
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,000
Hold on. Does she have to die because
she had a lousy defence lawyer...

368
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,920
and the father of one of her victims
is a buddy of the governor?

369
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,800
No. She has to die because
she committed a double murder.

370
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,000
Well, I'm not saying that she doesn't
deserve to be behind bars.

371
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,960
I'm saying I don't think this woman
deserves to be put to death.

372
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,880
Let's go. Come on.

373
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,480
- Whoa.
- I want things to work out for you here.

374
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,560
- What does that mean?
- It means be sensible.

375
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,640
- Don't patronize me.
- Oh, not intended.

376
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,680
- Oh, I see. I'm just supposed
to shut up and be grateful...
- No, not grateful. Successful.

377
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,200
- And you're dead set on preventing it.
- Oh, boy, John, I really
appreciate your confidence.

378
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:58,760
- I want you to have a chance.
- Oh, by putting me in a job
where no one expects anything.

379
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,160
What have you done
to deserve anything more?

380
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,280
I think I've lost my appetite.

381
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,920
- Can you tell me where Morris lives?
- Next one.

382
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,800
Hi.

383
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,720
- Who are you?
- Uh, Miss Morris, well, I'm Rick Hayes.

384
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,640
I'm with the State Clemency Board.

385
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,720
- What's it about?
- Well, it's about your niece,
Cindy Liggett.

386
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,080
- No.
- No, she's not your niece?

387
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,000
- No. Not any more.
- Well, she did live here, yes?

388
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,080
- Mm-mmm. No. No.
- Well, uh, can I just ask you...

389
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,040
- There seems to be a...
- No.

390
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,680
Ooh, baby, you drive me

391
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,480
So don't send me home

392
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,880
I dressed up my windows
and I shined up my chrome

393
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,280
You're blowin'my gaskets

394
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,760
Lay down a five and I'll
show you my kitty cat.

395
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,240
Come here. I'd like to talk to you about
a girl named Cindy Liggett.

396
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:29,800
Don't turn up my heater
Don't shut off my light

397
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,200
How she got into it?

398
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,120
How far back you want me to go?

399
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,480
I mean, her mama's boyfriend
got her high on smack when she
was 14, and then he fucked her.

400
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,000
- So...
- Cindy got into fuckin' and shootin' up
because that's what her mama was into.

401
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,160
Tell me about
the girl she killed.

402
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,320
- Debbie Hunt.
- Yeah. What, you knew her?

403
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,000
Everybody knew Debbie.
Her daddy was foreman at McGuire.

404
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,120
You... Cindy's mom, she worked at
McGuire Lumber as well, yeah?

405
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,400
Hunt's bookkeeper. Hell, she couldn't
add water to orange juice.

406
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,640
What, like personal favours?

407
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,200
On-the-job services.

408
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,640
Sweet deal for old Hunt
till rumours started flyin'.

409
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,360
Then she spread it around she stole
from petty cash and fired her.

410
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,240
I'm sorry. You're saying that she knew this
when she went in that house that night.

411
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,120
It's like she was trying to
get even for her mom.

412
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,960
She was too screwed up
to know what she was doin'.

413
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,800
- I loved her and all, but...
- Did you see her that night?

414
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,200
You know if she
was on any drugs?

415
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,720
Look, I'm on next.

416
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:11,000
Doug? Hi. I'm, I'm Rick Hayes.
I'm with the Clemency Board.

417
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,000
The reason I'm here is, uh, it looks like
Cindy could be executed in three weeks.

418
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,040
- Uh-huh.
- Well, l-I'm just...

419
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,520
l-I'm wondering, uh,
now that it's ancient history...

420
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,760
if there was anything you might
like to add before it's too late.

421
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,960
- Like what?
- Well...

422
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,120
Well, l-I know you plea-bargained
down to second-degree murder...

423
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,080
- in exchange for testifying
against her at the trial...
- Yeah.

424
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,960
And at the trial you said
the whole thing was her idea.

425
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,760
- Actually, that's kind of unusual, isn't it?
- Why?

426
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,800
I don't know. I mean,
17-year-old guys...

427
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,160
don't usually let girls lead 'em
around, now, do they?

428
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,280
Maybe she was the one
that was unusual.

429
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,040
Th-The two of you had pulled off
quite a few burglaries that summer.

430
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:00,320
- So she masterminded all of'em.
- I was 17 fuckin' years old, boy.

431
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,880
Oh, uh, I see what you mean. She was...
She was older. She was, what, 19?

432
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,440
Yeah, 19, goin' on about 30.

433
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,600
And drugs. What kind of drugs
were you on?

434
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:12,120
Some weed, some beer.

435
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,560
- That's all?
- Yeah.

436
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,560
What about crack?

437
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,280
- Nah, no crack.
- You sure? Because the,
the police report...

438
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,360
- Am I sure?
- Yeah.

439
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,280
You think I'm ever gonna
forget that night?

440
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,720
Well, you would if it would save you from
being executed, now, wouldn't you?

441
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,800
- You're fuckin' with me.
- No, you help me, and maybe
I can help you.

442
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,920
- Did she send you?
- No.

443
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,080
She suckin' your cock?

444
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,720
Oh, shit, she can get a guy
to do anything she wants.

445
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,520
She's a cocksuckin' witch!

446
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,120
I'll kick your ass!

447
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,200
Fuckers!

448
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,960
Have you got mental problems?
Is that why they stuck you down here?

449
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,880
- Hey...
- 'Cause that's gotta be it.
- It got out of hand.

450
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,000
Listen to me. I don't care what your
name is. Your brother can fire my ass.

451
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,520
- Look...
- You're not here to retry this case or duke
it out with the prosecution's witness.

452
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,080
Sam, when I came here you asked me
if I wanted to work. That's all I'm
trying to do.

453
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,760
I thought you'd be a lazy bastard. I didn't
know you'd go into business for yourself.

454
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,680
Well, maybe the woman
doesn't deserve to die.

455
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,600
- That's not your decision, Rick.
- Okay.

456
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,640
- You understand? Huh?
- Yeah.

457
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,440
Good. Now, I'm reassigning you. Do some
fact checking on the John Reese report.

458
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,280
- What about all the interviews
I'm supposed to do?
- No, no, no, no. John Reese.

459
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,160
Or you're out of here.

460
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,880
Who do you think you are, man?
Get your butt over here.

461
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,200
Attention on the yard.
Attention on the yard.

462
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:10,440
The following inmate, Labarber, Michelle,
report to the visiting room.

463
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,440
Well, I'll be damned.

464
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,120
- Hey, Reg?
- What?

465
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,480
Reg, come here.
I wanna show you something.

466
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,480
- You remember that guy?
- What guy?

467
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,280
- That guy from Clemency.
- Yeah. What?

468
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,800
- He sent me a picture of the Taj Mahal.
- The what?

469
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,560
The, the, the, the Taj Mahal.
It's this place in India.

470
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,800
This king built it
for his queen.

471
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,640
Oh, yeah, that's nice.
I like that.

472
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,280
Here, come on.
Hey, hey, let me see.

473
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,400
Cindy. Cindy,
turn it down this way.

474
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,000
- Got that?
- Oh, that's nice. Nice!

475
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,160
- That looks real good.
- Yeah, I've seen that one before.

476
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,880
- Oh, yeah. I bet you been
there a hundred times too.
- Well, I think it's pretty.

477
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,800
What's it say?

478
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,560
It says, "I wish you were there.
Sincerely, Slick Rick."

479
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,560
- What the hell's that mean?
- Oh, nothin'. Just a kind of a joke.

480
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,680
Good luck with your appeal,
Mr Reese. Goodbye.

481
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,760
Mr Reese, how are you? Hi.

482
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,440
- Where's Sam?
- Well, he had to work
on another case today.

483
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,160
- Who are you?
- I'm Rick Hayes.

484
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,640
- I'm gonna be working on your report.
- I can't believe Sam didn't come.

485
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,440
Well, uh, I'd just like to verify a few things,
if that's okay.

486
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,360
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

487
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,120
- Tell me, have you read the report?
- Of course I read it.

488
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,920
- There's another letter comin'
you have to put in.
- Oh? From whom?

489
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,160
Dr Arnold Marks.

490
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,880
- What's the nature of the letter?
- You don't know who he is?

491
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,240
- No.
- He's the top cardiovascular
surgeon in New York City.

492
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,200
- Oh.
- And a personal friend.

493
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,080
He did my bypass.

494
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,000
Man read my book, came down here,
did my bypass, no charge.

495
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:19,000
Well, you have a lot of
impressive friends, Mr Reese.

496
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,520
Yeah, and right now I'm gonna need
every one of'em. You read my book?

497
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,920
- Yeah, I started it.
- Finish it.

498
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,560
- I plan to.
- You see the letter from the
dean of the Yale law school?

499
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,760
- Yeah.
- I've been corresponding with him.

500
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,400
I've strategized all my appeals,
you know. I taught myself.

501
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,200
I've taken control
of the killing machine.

502
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,920
Look at me.

503
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,000
Is he working
for the white girl now?

504
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,280
- What?
- Cindy Liggett.

505
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,160
Is she the one getting clemency?
Is that... That's why Sam's not here?

506
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,160
Mr Reese, the governor
determines who gets clemency.

507
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,040
Yeah, but what is
the smart money saying, huh?

508
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:10,240
I mean, who's gonna live, me or
the white girl? Who's he gonna forgive?

509
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,560
A man of colour
who earned a law degree...

510
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,720
who wrote a best-seller and won the
admiration of some of our best people...

511
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,480
or a white trash girl who
bludgeoned two people to pulp...

512
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,440
without blinking an eye?

513
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,080
They will be diminished...

514
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,160
by my death...

515
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:35,640
'cause I represent everything
they love and admire.

516
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,400
How they gonna go
and kill a man...

517
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,520
who has been on The New York
Times best-seller list?

518
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,920
- Hey there.
- Hey.

519
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,320
So, what's all that stuff?
Homework?

520
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,360
No, these are your trial transcripts. Um,
look, I'm not supposed to be here, okay?

521
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,400
- They took me off the case.
- How come?

522
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,320
Mmm, doesn't matter.
But there's stuff in here,
especially in your sentencing hearing.

523
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,160
- Forget it.
- Grounds for appeal that
haven't been raised. No...

524
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,400
- Just leave it alone.
- Think your lawyer really blew it.

525
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,640
- You might not have gotten
the death penalty.
- Well, it doesn't matter now, does it?

526
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,360
Yeah, it does to me.
What do I have to say to you?

527
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,800
Look, if you wanna be my buddy,
just come see me on Saturday, okay?
I got two left.

528
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,880
What... You tell me what it is I have to say
to you to get you to want to save your
own life.

529
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,400
- What is this with you, some
kind of ego thing or what?
- What?

530
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,080
You don't like to lose.
Is that it?

531
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,520
What are you
tryin' to prove here?

532
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,840
I'm just trying to do my job.

533
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,640
I mean, I guess this is
the first real job I've had.

534
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,760
I knew you was a rich boy.

535
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,400
Huh. Yeah? It shows, does it?

536
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:50,520
See, growing up I thought everyone lived
like me. I had a good time.

537
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,680
I mean, I graduated law school
and...

538
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,400
- I'm sorry. I don't want to bore you
with this, but I'd like to...
- I know.

539
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,720
I been listenin' to the same four
life stories for way too long now.

540
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,000
One more would be just great.

541
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:07,000
Well, uh, I graduated
law school and, uh...

542
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,960
I drew a salary from my dad's company,
and I travelled and I partied.

543
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,240
Tough. Breakin' my heart here.

544
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:17,920
Yeah, well, the recession hit
and my father's business fell apart.

545
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,440
I tried to help with
the company and...

546
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,360
I mean, we almost got things
turned around, but, uh,
a bunch of loans came due...

547
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:28,560
and, and one thing
led to another and, uh...

548
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,440
See, we ended up juggling the books
and borrowing on false collateral...

549
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:36,560
and we lost everything, and,
and I beat a fraud charge...

550
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,040
and, uh...

551
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,000
and l-I almost got disbarred.

552
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,560
I mean, I don't even
know how it all...

553
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,200
It's just...
One thing led to another.

554
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,160
Yeah, I know how that goes.

555
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,840
Yard recall and lockdown.
Yard recall and lockdown.

556
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,040
You gotta go.

557
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,240
- Well...
- See ya.

558
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,400
Saturday?

559
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,160
Saturday.

560
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,040
Sam! Hold on there.

561
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,880
- Goddam it, what are you trying to do?
- Just hold on one second.

562
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,440
Let me see that stick
you got in your hand.

563
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,640
- It's a sand wedge.
- Ah, well, you don't want
to use a sand wedge.

564
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,160
I'm up to my eyeballs in sand, and
you're telling me I don't want to use
a sand wedge?

565
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,720
- That's right. You wanna use
a pitching wedge.
- Just back off.

566
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,280
- Give me the sand wedge.
- Listen to me. Pitching wedge, okay?

567
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:36,520
Break your wrists off right away,
cut straight down into it.

568
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,280
Trust me.

569
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,600
All right, but if you're wrong you're
working the Department of Highways
tomorrow.

570
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,200
Okay.

571
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,720
Right down now.

572
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,120
- Okay!
- You're welcome.

573
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,160
Goddang. I forgot
who I was dealing with.

574
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,560
Probably grew up on the
ninth hole at White Sands.

575
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:05,600
Well, golf's about as close as we came
to any kind of organized religion.

576
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,120
Let's put it that way.

577
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,960
- The Reese reports ready to go?
- Well, yeah, except for
your recommendation.

578
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,320
- You want this in or out?
- You can take it out.

579
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,600
Why don't you finish up
on Liggett.

580
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,840
Go to St. Charles County and
do those last few interviews.

581
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,800
No problem.

582
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,400
Nice.

583
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,400
You gotta watch yourself, Rick.

584
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,560
You get sucked in,
it does nobody any good.

585
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,600
- You hear me?
- Yeah.

586
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,480
So you do all this work
on these capital cases...

587
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,800
for a governor who, who never
grants clemency, huh?

588
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,800
Always a first time.

589
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,800
- Well, how do you stay with it?
- I'm highly motivated.

590
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,720
If I don't pay my child support,
I'll end up in state prison.

591
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,680
You never get involved
emotionally?

592
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,920
You ever hear of a guy
named James Nichols?

593
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,320
Um, no, I don't think so.

594
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,560
I got to know him pretty well.

595
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,560
Big kid in a man's body.
Killed three people.

596
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,480
Yeah?

597
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,840
He wanted me to be there
at the end.

598
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,720
- Here you go.
- Made me promise.

599
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:27,320
They were still using the electric chair
then, and they messed up.

600
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,360
Took a long time
for Jimmy to die.

601
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,880
He started to burn, literally.

602
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,640
His knees fused together.

603
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,040
Smoke started coming off of him.
You could smell it.

604
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,960
Jesus.

605
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,360
I can still smell it.

606
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,400
This is her senior picture.

607
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,000
The high school dedicated
the full page.

608
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,680
They were all wild kids.

609
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,240
We let 'em run wild.

610
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,640
I mean, the things they were doin',
it could've happened to any of'em.

611
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:16,480
But I don't believe in killing.
"Thou shalt not kill."

612
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,440
Not even Cindy Liggett.

613
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,560
L-I can only i-imagine that must
be difficult for you to say.

614
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,320
Well, I'm not saying
that I forgive her...

615
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,360
although I'm trying.

616
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,840
God, I known her since
she was five years old...

617
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,000
and they were sweet kids.

618
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,320
It's just that
putting her to death...

619
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,880
is only gonna keep us
locked in this darkness.

620
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,800
Well, ma'am, would you consider signing
a statement on behalf of Miss Liggett?

621
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,360
No.

622
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,960
Bu... Can you tell me why not?

623
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,120
No.

624
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,440
- Good day, sir.
- Hi. I'm Rick Hayes.

625
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,680
Mr McGuire's in the drawing
room waiting for you, sir.

626
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,640
Thank you.

627
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,920
Mr McGuire, hello.

628
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,360
- This is Mr Faring, my attorney.
- Hi. Rick Hayes.

629
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,320
You wanted some kind
of a statement.

630
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,320
Well, it's an update.
It's required by law.

631
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:37,960
A copy of this has already
been sent to the governor.

632
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,080
- All right.
- I'm not in the best of health.

633
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,000
But I promise you...

634
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,880
that I'm gonna live to see this
woman pay for what's she's done.

635
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,160
This scum brutally
murdered my son...

636
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,120
and she's brutally murdered
an entire family's chance...

637
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,960
for another moment
of peace or happiness.

638
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:07,800
There's nothing left
for us now except justice.

639
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:15,400
My boy would've been
about your age today.

640
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,640
He didn't deserve to die
like that.

641
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,680
What she did to him...

642
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,400
It had to be a closed casket.

643
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,560
Mr Hayes, what if
it was your son?

644
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,680
First time I picked her up
was on a Drunk and Disorderly.

645
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,320
I was a beat cop. She was 14.

646
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,480
Had a set of balls on her
even as a kid.

647
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,040
This was no surprise.

648
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,920
She and Barnes had committed at least
20 burglaries that we knew of
that summer.

649
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,320
The brutality of the crime...
uh, did that seem in character?

650
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,880
- Character.
- Yeah.

651
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,280
A crackhead's got no character.

652
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,040
Doug Barnes was so hot to cut
a deal with the D. A...

653
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,840
he testified against Cindy and then
tossed in a couple of dope dealers
just for good measure.

654
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,880
- I'll sign it after this hearing.
- Yes, sir.

655
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,160
I have to be in court
in 30 minutes.

656
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,480
Okay, we're just about
finished here, Mr Rusk.

657
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,960
- I am trying to find her brother though.
- Her brother.

658
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,120
- You think he's gonna help you?
- He's in Walkerton.

659
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,920
Next time he screws up,
state prison.

660
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,480
Okay, well, I appreciate
your time. Thank you.

661
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,040
You can include these
in your report, Mr Hayes.

662
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:39,200
They were considered too inflammatory
to be introduced at the trial.

663
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,760
I hear she's changed quite a bit in there.
Is that right?

664
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,720
- She has.
- That's great.

665
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,400
You know, it's a shame that these people
don't get to change.

666
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,160
They'll stay like this forever.

667
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,360
Look, I prosecuted this case.

668
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,440
It was my first big case,
and I know it cold.

669
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,280
The attorney general's office is totally
behind us, and so is the public...

670
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,320
and we're gonna see
this sentence carried out.

671
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:08,000
Now, you can dick around all you want,
but this sentence will be carried out.

672
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,440
It's good to see you, Joe.

673
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:33,480
"...call our grandfather
Grandpa."

674
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,160
Frances?

675
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,240
Frances?

676
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,720
What time is it, Frances?

677
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:51,440
3.30. Saturday hours are over.

678
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:55,200
Shit.

679
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,240
Ain't no man worth
gettin' upset over.

680
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,160
Shut up.

681
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,920
You wanna get mad, I can give you
a lot better things to get mad about.

682
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,200
- Just stay out of it, bitch!
- Who you callin' bitch, bitch?

683
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,320
Calling' you bitch,
you stupid bitch!

684
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,000
You think anybody's gonna marry you
after you killed two husbands?

685
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,720
At least I ever got married.
That's more than you can say.

686
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,640
- Shut up!
- Girl, you losin' your mind.

687
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,880
...since the tender age
of 12 years old.

688
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:36,280
Carrie says that men are stupid,
and Carrie specializes in...

689
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,720
Hey.

690
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,520
Didn't think you were comin'.

691
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,800
Well, I was out of town.

692
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,000
So much for promises.

693
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,480
I was doing interviews
for your report.

694
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,560
Then I guess you know
everything now.

695
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,240
No, I know about the past.

696
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,200
You're not that person any more.

697
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:07,680
All right, look, I need you
to tell me about that night.

698
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,200
That night?

699
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,360
That night is...

700
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,160
inside me like this...

701
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,920
big, terrible shadow.

702
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,360
I hated Debbie Hunt.

703
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:34,080
I hated everything,
everything I didn't have.

704
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:39,440
And Debbie Hunt used to just
rub my nose in it.

705
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,840
And all that hate...

706
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,720
just blew everything apart.

707
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,880
I killed them.

708
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,960
I killed myself.

709
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,880
I know what I did.

710
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,480
I can't change that.

711
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:00,200
I can only change myself.

712
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:05,240
Uh, I guess there are just...

713
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,160
some things...

714
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,400
can't be forgiven.

715
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,120
Why not...

716
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,120
if a person's able to change?

717
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:19,000
'Cause the people doin' the
forgivin' have to change too.

718
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:34,680
Today for the first time
in my term as Governor...

719
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,200
in light of a number
of most-compelling reasons...

720
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,080
I am granting clemency
in a capital case.

721
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:48,560
I'm withdrawing my order of
execution for John Henry Reese...

722
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:52,440
and commuting his sentence
to life imprisonment.

723
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:55,280
- What about Liggett?
- There should be no mistake however...
- No.

724
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:58,800
- That I remain a strong proponent
of the death penalty...
- Why?

725
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:02,040
- And a firm believer of its place in our society.
- What the hell do you want, a religious conversion?

726
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:05,160
- Wouldn't have hurt.
- And I know the people of this state...

727
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,240
overwhelmingly agree with me.

728
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,520
- There are, however...
- Look...

729
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,520
- those rare occasions when
exceptions cry out.
- It's an issue of credibility.

730
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,560
- And the rule of law...
- Whose credibility?
- Mine.

731
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,960
Must acknowledge
extraordinary circumstances.

732
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,680
- I'll take a few questions now.
- Governor.
- Governor.

733
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:25,280
Governor, could you tell us
the compelling reasons
that prompted your decision...

734
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,120
to commute
Mr Reese's sentence?

735
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:32,960
- Mr Reese has gone as far as any prisoner I've ever seen...
- I stick my neck out, there better be a damn good reason.

736
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:38,480
- Transforming himself into a thinking, contributing...
- I don't see it with Liggett. Maybe you do. I'm sorry.

737
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,440
- This is about reelection, isn't it?
- Responsible and very unique voice.

738
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,000
It's about getting
the black vote, isn't it?

739
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,200
It's about clemency.

740
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:50,160
Governor, what about
the Liggett case?

741
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,360
Clemency was denied. Miss Liggett's
death warrant is set to be carried out...

742
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,600
at 12.01 a.m. On Saturday,
one week from today.

743
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:03,000
If it's carried out, Cindy Liggett will be
the first woman in 11 years...

744
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,960
to be executed in this state.

745
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:09,600
- Any comment?
- Miss Liggett committed a brutal
and senseless double murder.

746
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:13,560
Her sex made no difference to her victims.
It makes no difference to us
under our legal system.

747
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,480
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

748
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,200
I know.

749
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,960
Look, I've got an idea
for an appeal.

750
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:42,360
No, no. You've gotta keep
letting me fight this.

751
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,600
I am afraid to say no...

752
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,200
and I am afraid to say yes.

753
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,720
Look.

754
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,840
There is somethin'
you can do for me.

755
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,880
- One, two, three, hey!
- What's this about?

756
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,000
- One, two, three, hey!
- I'm a friend of your sister's.

757
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,760
- One, two, three, hey!
- Here's how it is.

758
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:20,680
Uh, she's got six more days, okay?
Maybe you already know that.

759
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,040
Now she wanted me
to get you this.

760
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,760
You're the only family she's got.

761
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,480
She loves you.

762
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:35,320
- She said that?
- Yes, she did.

763
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,280
You'll be doin' K.P., boy!
Let's move it!

764
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,440
Six days.

765
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,240
We're doin' all we can.

766
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,760
I'm the one who turned her in.
Did you know that?

767
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,160
Look, she doesn't hold anything
against you, okay?

768
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:54,080
She's... She's actually grateful that
you stopped her. Believe me.

769
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,280
- The cops, they, um... they said
I'd be savin' her life.
- Yep.

770
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,840
What I did,
I did it to help her.

771
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:04,880
She was all messed up. Couldn't
tell what she was gonna do next.

772
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,320
I didn't know this
was gonna happen.

773
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:10,760
Listen, she knows all that,
all of it.

774
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,080
She's okay.

775
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,760
Come on, boys! Move it!

776
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:27,480
So my next trick, kids,
is very impressive, very exciting.

777
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:31,680
What I'm going to do is show you
a beautiful bouquet of flowers.

778
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,720
- Would ya like to see that?
- Yeah.

779
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:37,160
Would ya? Okay. Good.
Hold on. Ah, here they are.

780
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:41,640
Aren't they beautiful?
As you can see, there's blue...

781
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,960
and red and pink.

782
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:48,080
What's so funny? Why are you giggling?
What do you mean there's no flowers?

783
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:51,240
- Hi, I'm Rick Hayes. Remember?
- This happens to be my home.

784
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,720
- Look, I, I need your help. I'm sorr...
- It's my daughter's birthday.

785
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:59,320
Okay. Well, I need you to file a stay of
execution in Federal District Court
for Cindy Liggett.

786
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:03,200
- Mama, Vanessa took my M&Ms.
- Okay, sweetheart, go back.
I'll take care of it.

787
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,840
- Okay.
- I'll be right there.

788
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,880
L-I'm sorry. But we... we have some
big-time grounds for appeal here.

789
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:12,160
- What grounds?
- Well, ineffective counsel.
Basically, your partner Ed Duffy blew it.

790
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:16,160
- Oh, you got a hell of a nerve.
- All right. Well, you take a look
at this, uh...

791
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,880
I've got a police report here, okay?

792
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:23,000
And this is a statement made by
her brother before the arrest.

793
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:28,480
She and Doug Barnes had been
up for two days smokin' crack.
Now, he never introduced it.

794
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,440
You tell me why.

795
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:34,200
Well, I don't know. Maybe he felt a jury
sees a drug addict as subhuman.

796
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:37,240
You and I both know they'd be a lot more
likely to execute an addict.

797
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:40,240
Hey, we're talkin' a level of intoxication
here that might save her life.

798
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,640
- Oh, man, it was a strategic move.
- Oh, come on.

799
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,640
- Maybe he should have
pressed the drugs.
- We're six days from her execution.

800
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:49,240
This is the only chance
she's got.

801
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:54,040
Will you do it? Look, I'll handle
the research. I'll do the legwork.

802
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:58,320
- Mom, I wanna open my presents.
- In a minute, baby. In a minute.

803
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,320
One, two, three.

804
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,080
Abracadabra.

805
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,120
- I'll do my own research.
- Good.

806
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,400
Good night.

807
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,320
Good evening, sir.

808
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:56,320
Thanks.

809
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,240
Nice to see you.

810
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,720
- Hey.
- Hey.

811
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,960
- You made it.
- Yeah, I'm sorry I'm late, sweetie.

812
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:15,600
Well, you missed the soggy crab cakes
and the California champagne.

813
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,960
- Well, you look beautiful, though.
- Thank you.

814
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:20,520
- Hey, here's John.
- There he is.

815
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,920
- Hi. - Hi, how ya doin'?
- I'm good. You? - You okay?

816
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:27,240
- Yeah, everything's good.
- You free on Sunday, maybe
for some tennis or whatever?

817
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,760
Uh, yeah. Maybe.

818
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:36,160
Rick?

819
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:39,440
- They spent hundreds of thousands
on the building alone.
- Governor? Governor?

820
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:42,440
- Excuse me, sir. Hi. Um, I'd like to...
- Mr Hayes.

821
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,640
- Yes, sir.
- Clemency.
- Yes.

822
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,360
You fellas did a mighty
fine job on the Reese case.

823
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:50,520
- Thank you, sir. I'd like to talk to you
about Cindy Liggett.
- Liggett?

824
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,280
- Yes. I urge you to reconsider. - Oh, not now.
- I believe that this woman deserves clemency as well.

825
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:56,480
- This is completely inappropriate.
- It's all right.
- No, it isn't all right.

826
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,560
- We'll talk tomorrow in my office.
John, set that up.
- She had ineffective counsel.

827
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,560
- She should've been given a life sentence.
- I'm sorry.
- Shut up.

828
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:04,200
- Prison is the only stable environment...
- This is difficult for all of us, Mr Hayes.

829
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:07,640
- That this woman has ever known. Her life outside...
- Rick, come on. 
- John, let go of me.

830
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,760
Her life outside was a nightmare.
She's changed. She's grown.

831
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:15,040
She's a different person now. Now,
we're... we're not settin' an example here.

832
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:18,680
We never gave her a chance to become
like us, sir! We've become like her.

833
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,720
You have an eloquent tongue, Mr Hayes.
Must run in the family.

834
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:25,320
- Well, Cindy Liggett didn't have a chance,
sir. And if you'd just...
- Now, you've had your turn!

835
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,640
Now, the rule of law demands that
this girl receive the maximum penalty
for what she did.

836
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:31,600
- Governor, you...
- May I finish?

837
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:35,520
- Yes.
- Now, if you don't like this particular law,
by all means, change it.

838
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:39,720
But in the meantime, it's my sworn duty
as governor to uphold the laws
as I find them.

839
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:43,280
You understand? You just pour
yourself a good, stiff drink.

840
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,920
- Enjoy the rest of the party
with your brother John.
- Sir.

841
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,520
- Let's go.
- Mark, I'm sorry about that.
Now, the building...

842
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:53,480
Young turks.

843
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:56,880
- I hope you know what you just did.
- John, the man pulls the switch.
Bottom line.

844
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,600
- Quiet. Quiet. Quiet. Quiet.
- Look, I don't care who hears this.

845
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,800
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- For what? Do you think this is about me?

846
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,520
- Do you know what you're doing?
- Yeah.

847
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:07,240
- You're ruining your life and mine too.
- What about her life?

848
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,360
- You can't change what's gonna happen.
- Then you try and stop me.

849
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,280
- I'm trying. Believe me, I'm trying.
- Uh-huh.

850
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,440
I kept you from being disbarred after
that mess with Dad, but I don't know.

851
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:17,520
- You've got me on this one, brother.
- What are you talkin' about?

852
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:22,120
- John, you think this is about us?
You and me?
- You tell me.

853
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:26,320
You are so way off. This is the first thing
ever that is not about you and me.

854
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:39,000
I figured I'd save you
the trouble.

855
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,920
I'm sorry.

856
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,040
Don't be.
And congratulations on Reese.

857
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:53,120
You were right.
There's a first time for everything.

858
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,480
She has unlimited visiting time.
You know that, don't you?

859
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:00,640
Then I'd better get goin'.
Sam, thanks.

860
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,760
- Thanks?
- Hey, I don't regret anything
that's happened here.

861
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,880
It's the next four days
I'm worried about.

862
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,160
I wish I could tell you
something that would help, but...

863
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:14,280
- Well, there is somethin' you could do.
- What's that?

864
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,440
Well, her brother's up
at Walkerton Work Camp.

865
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:20,560
Now, if you could get him a visit with her,
that would mean a lot.

866
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:24,000
- I'll see what I can do.
- Well, that'd be great.

867
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,200
- See y'all.
- Bye, Rick.

868
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:45,720
- Hey, how's it goin'?
- I tried to reach you at the office.

869
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,040
- We heard on the appeal?
- We got turned down.

870
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,440
- Shit!
- This came this morning.

871
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:53,040
- No hearing, nothing. Just a ruling.
- Man.

872
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:57,400
Our next move should be Judge Gorman
on the Federal Court of Appeals.
He's a good guy.

873
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,400
- Who's that, Gorman?
- Yeah, Gorman.

874
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,720
- They're in recess now.
Can you track him down?
- Yeah, l-I'll get to work on it.

875
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:06,920
Look, uh, you should know I left the job.
I have no authority any more.

876
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,280
Well, great. Now that you're no longer a
third-rate bureaucrat, you can really help.

877
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:13,560
Well, let's hope so.

878
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:18,120
Mrs Gorman, I promise you I would not be
calling you at your home at this hour...

879
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,120
if it weren't urgent.

880
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:23,840
No, l-I understand. It's-It's...
It's his vacation, but...

881
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:27,320
Well... No, I'm...
I'm sorry, but...

882
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,480
Well, all right.

883
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:32,960
Uh, look, I'm sorry
to have bothered you.

884
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,120
- Hi.
- Remember me?

885
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,600
I've got a fully-stocked bar now.

886
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:45,120
Uh, this is for you.

887
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,280
He's a family friend...

888
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:50,800
and, uh, I guess
you'll be lookin' for a job.

889
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:57,920
- Senator Paul Hagan?
- He's looking for a new legislative aide.

890
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,600
He's expecting your call.

891
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:03,960
- No strings.
- No strings?

892
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:08,000
Well, I figure if you can
chase a lost cause, so can I.

893
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:11,080
I mean, uh...

894
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:18,280
What are you doin'?
I don't understand.

895
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,360
You're just...
You're throwing it away. L...

896
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:25,000
Is it some kind of...
romantic slumming?

897
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:28,680
- No.
- You're too young for a midlife crisis.

898
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,200
I'm... I'm sorry.
I don't get it.

899
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:43,040
- Look, Jill...
- No, I gotta go.

900
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:52,920
- You listen to me, Rick.
You have done more for me...
- No.

901
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,680
- Than anyone ever has.
- Look, it is not over, okay?

902
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,800
- There is a judge on Federal
Court Appeals.
- No.

903
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,600
- Yes.
- No.

904
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:04,960
I have screwed up a lot of things in my life.
This one I wanna do right.

905
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:11,680
Now, I want you to
get me somethin'. Okay?

906
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,560
Okay.

907
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:19,280
It's not so bad.

908
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,240
What isn't?

909
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:25,440
Knowin' what comes next.

910
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:31,920
What do you think
about this one?

911
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,440
Uh, it's...
It's fancy too.

912
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,360
I don't think it's that fancy.

913
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:40,080
Well, l-I just... It's something
simple, you know? Like, uh...

914
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:43,280
What exactly does
she need it for?

915
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,600
It doesn't matter.

916
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,560
What about this one?
It's simple.

917
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,960
Yeah.

918
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:10,320
I mean, would you donate
two dollars if you had two?

919
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:14,760
- This is the third time she's
done this to me.
- It's about time someone told her.

920
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,600
Well, I'm sorry.

921
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:22,280
There was nothing you or I
could've done. It's the system.

922
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,320
Well, we're the system.

923
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:31,960
Aw, wait a minute.
Why not let it go?

924
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:35,960
- You wouldn't understand, John.
- Try me.

925
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:39,320
Everyone gave up on her.

926
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:53,440
Meanwhile, the clock continues to count
down for death row inmate Cindy Liggett.

927
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:56,000
Sometime tomorrow evening, Liggett
is expected to be transferred...

928
01:04:56,120 --> 01:05:00,160
to Men's State Prison, where she will
spend her last 48 hours on deathwatch.

929
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:02,920
Liggett was convicted of the murders
of Matt McGuire and Debbie Hunt...

930
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,200
in St. Charles 12 years ago, and her
execution has been scheduled
three times.

931
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,560
This time, however, her attorneys'efforts
to achieve a fourth stay...

932
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,680
appear not to have succeeded.

933
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,720
Thank you.

934
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:41,200
I hear there's some people up in Catesville
who are real eager to see you, Doug.

935
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:45,800
- I don't know anyone up there.
- It seems Cindy wasn't the only one
you put away when you copped your plea.

936
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:49,280
You also turned in your dealers.
Now, do you remember that?

937
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:53,480
- That's news to me.
- Oh, then you won't mind
being transferred, huh?

938
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:55,280
- What?
- Yeah. It's all arranged.

939
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:58,000
You see, someone I care about might die
'cause of one lyin' scumbag.

940
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:01,560
So I'm gonna send that scumbag
to Catesville.

941
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:07,120
- Do it.
- The two of you were out of
your mind on crack that night.

942
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:11,840
That fact could've saved her life.
Now, why'd you say it was only beer
and marijuana?

943
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:18,080
- I'll see you in Catesville.
- Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.

944
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:23,360
- What the hell you want?
- I want a statement.

945
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:26,240
I want to know why you
kept quiet about the drugs.

946
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:30,440
- Well, they said to.
- Who told you to?

947
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,840
The D.A. Rusk.

948
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,480
The D.A. Instructed you to lie?

949
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:45,040
- And you won't get me moved?
- You sign this affidavit.

950
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:49,720
- Clemency Office.
- Hi, Helen. It's Rick. Did you have
any luck finding thejudge?

951
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:53,840
Yeah. Um, he's at the Gulf Winds Fishing
Camp somewhere near Marquesa Lake.

952
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:56,560
- But there's no phone.
- How'd you track him down there?

953
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:00,400
Well, Sam...
Sam says good luck.

954
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:02,880
- Tell Sam thank you.
- You're welcome, Rick. Bye.

955
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,760
You won't be able
to take those.

956
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,400
- Why not?
- It's a part of the procedure.

957
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:24,360
- What harm is a few drawings gonna do?
- I'm sorry, Cindy.

958
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:42,760
- Hey, Reg.
- Hey, baby girl.

959
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:48,280
Why'd you shave your head?

960
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:53,440
It's for you, girl. Nothing left to lose.
You know what I mean?

961
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:59,040
You keep the faith now.

962
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:04,160
Bye.

963
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,280
All right, Cindy.

964
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:00,680
Miss Liggett?

965
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,960
I'm Warden Laverty.

966
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:06,360
This is Reverend Cummins.

967
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:09,440
Officer Mulkey
will be right here.

968
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:14,640
Anything you want from the canteen
in the way of sodas or candy,
just let her know.

969
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:18,480
- And she'll also have a TV hooked up
for you to watch.
- No TVs.

970
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:22,520
That's okay too.

971
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:26,400
We will need for you to change
into that blue uniform there.

972
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:30,880
Cindy, I'm on 24-hour call.

973
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:34,160
I'll come to you
whenever you want.

974
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:38,080
Okay. Well...

975
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:41,600
we're going to try to make you
as comfortable as possible.

976
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:44,000
Thanks.

977
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:37,720
Okay, c'mon. Let's go.

978
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,400
Get your ass outta the car.

979
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:45,440
They go to the beach
every weekend.

980
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:04,400
- They got a V.C.R.
- Yeah, I'll get it.

981
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:32,800
Shit!

982
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,800
Oh, it's you, you fuckin' whore.

983
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:39,160
Get outta my house.
Get outta my house!

984
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:42,880
Get outta here, you thievin' whore!
Get outta my house!

985
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:10,240
There it is.

986
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,520
Judge Gorman!

987
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:57,480
Goddam it, Will! What the hell
are you doin' here anyway?

988
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,240
- Judge Gorman?
- Yes.

989
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:01,760
Your Honour, I'm sorry.
My name is Rick Hayes...

990
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:05,560
and I have a motion from State Legal Aid
to stay the execution of Cindy Liggett...

991
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:09,080
which is scheduled for 12.01 a.m.
This Saturday, tomorrow night.

992
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:12,640
Now, attached here you'll find
a witness's statement...

993
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:17,320
- that the prosecution attempted
to suppress evidence.
- All right, all right. I know the case.

994
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:20,480
Well, once you've read it, when might
we expect to hear from you?

995
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:23,200
I'll radio my ruling back
from the ranger station.

996
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,720
Thank you, sir.
All right.

997
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,960
Thank you.

998
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:34,480
DDKnews time, 12. 14.
In other news,

999
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:37,040
prison officials continue
preparations for the execution...

1000
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:39,160
of double-murderer Cindy Liggett.

1001
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:43,160
Unless a stay is issued, Liggett is
scheduled to die in less than 24 hours.

1002
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:10,800
I found that judge.
I think he might help us.

1003
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:29,200
- You gonna stay?
- Yeah.

1004
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:33,520
To the end?

1005
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,600
When I go,
will you be there?

1006
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:45,200
It's too much to ask, huh?

1007
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:47,640
No.

1008
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:52,320
If it happens, I will be there.

1009
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:43,360
I'm not a real breakfast person.

1010
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:46,720
Yeah, I'm just a...
I'm a coffee man myself.

1011
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:48,960
Me too.

1012
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:14,400
You see arriving here today some
who are for capital punishment
while others are against it.

1013
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:18,280
Others are carrying placards
saying "Cindy must die."

1014
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:21,280
- Kill the bitch.
- Others saying, "Thou shalt not kill."

1015
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,280
She know I'm comin'?

1016
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:43,200
Well, she's gonna be
glad to see ya.

1017
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,800
Bill?

1018
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:00,520
Bill.

1019
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,120
Hey.

1020
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:07,840
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

1021
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:12,040
I know, but what
you did was right.

1022
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:15,560
I didn't know this would happen.
If I'd known...

1023
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:19,000
I'm so glad that you're here.

1024
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:25,640
Amazing Grace

1025
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:30,200
How sweet the sound

1026
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:34,840
- That saved a wretch like me
- You know damn well she should die!

1027
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:39,080
- You over there with that sign!
- The crowd is becoming
more and more vocal.

1028
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:41,040
As the hour of
the execution approaches...

1029
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:44,200
every man, woman and child
that is gathered here...

1030
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,480
- has some opinion, whether they think...
- Kill her!

1031
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:49,360
Do you know what you're gonna do
when you get outta there?

1032
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:51,400
N-No, I'm not sure yet.

1033
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,800
Well, you better start
thinkin' about it.

1034
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:57,600
You better make some plans. Listen to me.
You're gonna end up right back there.

1035
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:04,160
- Hello.
- Linda. What's going on? Anything?

1036
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:06,600
No, he hasn't called yet, Rick.

1037
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:09,520
All right. What are we gonna do
if he turns us down?

1038
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,800
Only place left is
the U.S. Supreme Court.

1039
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:14,320
- Well, is there time?
- Not really.

1040
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:17,760
You need fourJustices to issue a stay.
We'd need at least a day.

1041
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:22,160
Well, then... then he just better come
through and that damn radio
better work.

1042
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:26,000
- I hope so.
- Well, do it.

1043
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:30,320
- All right.
- All right or yes? Look at me.

1044
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:36,040
You better look me in the eye and say yes,
'cause I'll be watchin' you.

1045
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:40,680
And I'm tellin' you, if you screw up,
I'm gonna come all the way back here
just to kick your ass.

1046
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:55,680
- Oh, this is insane.
- I know. I'm sorry.

1047
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,200
I mean, we don't pick up
that goddam signal, she's dead.

1048
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,920
Listen, Rick, we've still got
some time. Don't give up.

1049
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,040
Aw, Linda, he's gotta
come through.

1050
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,760
- Man.
- I decided to stop watchin' my weight.

1051
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,640
Filet mignon.

1052
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:33,440
Yeah, I always wanted to try it.

1053
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:40,520
Cindy, did you get
everything you asked for?

1054
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:42,600
Looks like it.

1055
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:45,600
Well, it's quite a meal.

1056
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:48,160
Hope you enjoy it.

1057
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:54,520
They get so nice
right before they kill ya.

1058
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:29,280
Hello, Cindy.

1059
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:33,240
How's that steak?

1060
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:35,720
Fine... what I had of it.

1061
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:41,600
Cindy, if you want me,
remember I'm just down the hall.

1062
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:46,200
Well, right now I feel like I got
everything and everybody I need.

1063
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:52,080
Oh, they sent these over
from Bridgeland.

1064
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:54,720
They thought
you should have 'em.

1065
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,200
Thank you.

1066
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:30,360
Miss Liggett?

1067
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:34,080
Dr Forrester would like
to see your arms.

1068
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:46,520
This is hard for everyone.

1069
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:49,560
We're going to get through
this together.

1070
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:53,000
- Would you like a sedative?
- No.

1071
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:57,320
- It's quite common.
- I'm not spendin' my last hour like that.

1072
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:01,440
- Well, if you change your mind...
- I won't.

1073
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:06,400
We'll be back
in about five minutes.

1074
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:16,680
Bill, come here for a minute.

1075
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:23,280
Now, listen to me.

1076
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:26,280
We'll always be
brother and sister.

1077
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:31,200
Nothing can ever
change that. Okay?

1078
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:36,160
You're in my heart.

1079
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:39,640
You know that? Hmm?

1080
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,960
Now, you go on, okay?

1081
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:56,120
- Well... - Look.
- Our timing wasn't exactly the best,
- was it?

1082
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:42,680
Cindy?

1083
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:14,440
"I have been directed
at 12.01 a. M...

1084
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,680
"by the Superintendent of Prisons...

1085
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:20,760
"to cause the sentence of death
to be executed on Cindy Leanne Liggett...

1086
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:24,880
"by intravenous injection
of a substance or substances...

1087
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:30,320
"in a lethal quantity sufficient to cause
the death of said Cindy Leanne Liggett...

1088
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:34,840
and until the said
Cindy Leanne Liggett is dead."

1089
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:57,600
Warden?

1090
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:05,440
Yes?

1091
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:10,880
Yes. Stand down.
Stand down!

1092
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:42,240
- Calm down. Calm down. It's over! It's over.
- Stop it! Stop it!

1093
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:46,240
- You've been saved. It's over.
- Stop it! No!

1094
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:48,680
Cindy. Cindy.

1095
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:51,720
You're saved. You're saved.
It's over. It's over.

1096
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:54,680
It's over. It's okay.

1097
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:59,040
Shh. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

1098
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:01,480
In a surprise announcement,
Deputy Warden Marvin Heinrich...

1099
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:05,160
here at Men's State Corrections informed
us just moments ago that the execution...

1100
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:08,360
of Cindy Liggett scheduled for
12.00 midnight six minutes ago...

1101
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:12,080
was abruptly cancelled three minutes
before it was to have been carried out.

1102
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:14,760
We are told Federal District
Court Judge Byron Gorman...

1103
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:19,200
issued the stay of execution based on
a petition from Miss Liggett's attorneys.

1104
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:22,160
We have no idea on whether or when
the State will appeal this ruling.

1105
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:24,840
You can see here we have
protestors on both sides.

1106
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:27,600
We will follow this big story throughout
the night. This is Peter Bellows...

1107
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,440
We stopped 'em.

1108
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:41,560
- I can't take any more.
- No, no, come on. You hold on.

1109
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:44,640
You hold onto me. I'm right
here for you. Come on.

1110
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:49,240
I saw you.

1111
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:52,960
I could feel
your eyes on me.

1112
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:55,280
I know.

1113
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:57,600
I wasn't scared.

1114
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:06,960
- Good evening.
- Ah, gentlemen, I think you know
District Attorney Rusk.

1115
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:09,760
- Pete, sorry to bring you out so late.
- Good to see you, Judge.

1116
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:12,680
Your Honours, any questions
you might have...

1117
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:16,520
any information you need,
I brought the files for each of you.

1118
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:18,440
Thank you.

1119
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:02,080
So that is their decision?

1120
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,920
Mm-hmm. Hmm.

1121
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:12,760
Good night.

1122
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:28,480
Cindy, a special panel
of Federal Court of Appeals...

1123
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:30,520
- was convened a short while ago.
- Oh, no.

1124
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:34,800
The stay of execution has been lifted.
We've been ordered to proceed.

1125
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:37,880
Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?
What, they couldn't wait?

1126
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,120
- This is...
- Let it go! Please.

1127
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:46,000
You have got
to let me go now.

1128
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:48,000
Yes.

1129
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:56,000
Don't take your eyes off me.

1130
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:52,720
...built by Shah Jahan
in 1631 to 1653...

1131
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:56,360
in the memory of his
beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal.

1132
01:34:56,480 --> 01:35:00,680
And Mumtaz Mahal means "the beautiful
ornament of the palace."

1133
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:04,040
And she was so beautiful
that Shah Jahan...

1134
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:06,600
and Shah Jahan
so loved his queen...

1135
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:09,800
that he commissioned this
building to be as beautiful...

1136
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:14,120
and inspiring
and graceful as she was...

1137
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:18,000
that he made in soul
of his love and her beauty.

1138
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:20,680
Darling
Don't you understand

1139
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:23,120
I feel so ill at ease

1140
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:26,000
The room is full of silence

1141
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:28,800
And it's getting hard to breathe

1142
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:32,120
Take this gilded cage of pain

1143
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:34,320
And set me free

1144
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:38,200
Take this overcoat of shame

1145
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:43,200
It never did belong to me

1146
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:59,520
It never did belong to me

1147
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:04,600
I need to go outside

1148
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:07,280
I need to leave the smoke

1149
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:09,920
'Cause I can't go on living

1150
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,720
In the same sick joke

1151
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:15,600
It seems our lives have taken on

1152
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:18,400
A different kind of twist.

1153
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:21,720
Now that you have given me.

1154
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:24,480
The perfect gift.

1155
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:44,160
You have given me the gift.

1156
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:50,160
For we have fallen.

1157
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:54,320
From our shelves.

1158
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:00,640
To face the truth.

1159
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:05,520
About ourselves.

1160
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:12,560
And we have tumbled.

1161
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:17,160
From our tree.

1162
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:29,000
Tumbled from our tree.

1163
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,120
And I can almost.

1164
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:41,080
I can almost hear
the rain fallin.

1165
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:47,120
Don't you know it feels so good.

1166
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:49,400
It feels so good.

1167
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:58,400
So let's go out
into the rain again.

1168
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:10,240
Just like we said
we always would.

1169
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:35,520
