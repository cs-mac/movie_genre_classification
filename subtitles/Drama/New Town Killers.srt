There is an inflation shock

00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,080

I called them about the noise.

She is.

No. I told you.
It's all right, Sean.

97

When did you get back? Late.

98
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,080
You rip her off?

Thanks.

Who is she?
Just let her in, Sean.

I've already given you
everything I had this week.

107
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,880
I can't get any more.

108
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,360
Get them on your side.

109
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,320
What do you mean?
How do you do that?

110
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,040
Do something for them, a small job.
Something easy.

111
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,120
Do it well, Alice,
and you never know.

Have you ever been to Amsterdam?

It's really lovely.

114
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,920
They need something picking up.

115
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,400
Something small.

116
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,120
Nothing to worry about.

117
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,760
You could go tomorrow morning.

118
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,920
I think if you did that

119
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,040
they would look upon your situation
very differently.

120
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,680
What was she asking you to do?
Don't.

121
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,160
How much do you owe?
Stop it.

122
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,960
How much does she owe you?
A lot.

123
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,000
Please stop it, Sean.
Think about what I said, Alice.

124
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,880
It won't be me next time.

125
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,960

Told me what?

128
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,560
Told you to stop spending money
you don't have.

129
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,200
How much do you owe? Tell me.

130
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,320
Stop it.
No. No, Alice!

131
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,840
How much?
I'm not a child, Sean!

132
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,280
Maybe you should stop
acting like one. How fucking much?

133
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,040
Why do you want to know?

134
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,880
Do you understand
what she was talking about?

135
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,520
Or what she actually wants you
to do? It's not a game, Alice.

136
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,400
You know, she's not kidding.
She fucking meant it!

137
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,120
How much? Fucking tell me, Alice!
How much?!

138
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,560
£8,000.

139
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,000
And the credit card bill?

SIGHS

141
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,240

Oh, shit.

144
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,880
I tried to pay it back. They
just kept giving me more money.

145
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,920
Said it was no problem, no hassle,

146
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,360
that I could take my time
paying it back.

147
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,400
And now this.

148
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,040
Oh, Sean.

CRIES

150
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,120
Think about what Mum
would have done...

151
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,480
then do the opposite.

152
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,760
You're not going
to Amsterdam, Alice.

153
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,760
No way.

154
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,960
You. You're late.

155
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,560
Come with me.

156
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,560
Keep this place sparkling clean
and keep your mouth shut.

157
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,680
I'll be back to check.

158
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,480
Remember, I've got a hundred Poles
who want this job,

159
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,680
and they're cheaper.

160
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,040
I thought I was here to be a waiter.

00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,160
Hello, Sean.

167
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,720
What?

168
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,960
We only need a few minutes
of your time.

169
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,920
We're here to make a proposal,
an offer.

170
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,480
He looks worried.
Don't be. It's very simple.

171
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,240
We want to play a game.

172
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,440
We offer you this.
£1,000.

173
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,200
And then this.

174
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,200
It opens a safety deposit box

175
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,840
in a train station which opens
at 9:00 tomorrow morning.

176
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,440
In there is another £11,000.

177
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,360
Which could be yours.
That's right, Sean. Yours.

178
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,240
All you have to do
is hide from 9pm tonight.

179
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,080
What do you mean, hide?

180
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,920
You hide... We seek.

181
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,320
And if we don't find you...
Then you get to keep it.

182
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,520
All of it. No strings attached.
It's yours.

183
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,000
You'll never see us again.

184
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,200
But if we do find you
in those 12 hours,
then all you have to do...

185
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,840
Is give the money and the key back.

186
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,800
What is this?
Who are you? I don't understand.

187
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,640
Take this number.

188
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,080
But you must call
before 9:00 tonight.

189
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,280
£12,000, Sean.

190
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,160
That's a lot of money.
Could clear a lot of debt.

191
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,760
Get someone out of trouble.
CLEARS THROAT

192
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,320
MAN: I'm sure I had it
When I came in.

193
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,680
I took it off, hung it up there
and I went in there.

194
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,480
Have you seen it?
Seen what?

195
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,560
A cigarette case.

196
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,280
No use asking him.
He was asleep when I came in.

197
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,480
Now, the case itself is worthless,
but my wife gave it to me years ago.

198
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,520
I'm really sorry about this.
I, er, maybe left it in the taxi.

199
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,360
Why don't you
sit back at your table

200
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,840
and I'll have one last look here?

201
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,360
Thank you.

202
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,760
What?

203
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,600
Empty your pockets.
HE HUFFS

204
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,160
I... I didn't...
Shut up.

205
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,240
Get out of my restaurant
before I call the police.

206
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,920
SEAN: Alice?

207
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,600
CLANKING

208
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,600

209
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,360
You seen Alice?
I think she's gone to see your mum.

210
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,280

214
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,320
No, you're not.

215
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,800
You're Alice.

216
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,280
Who's that?

217
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,200
Nothing.

218
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,400
Why don't you take your shirt off?

219
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,640
Hmm.

220
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,560
That's pretty.

221
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,400
Where did you get that?

222
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,440
Hmm?

Oh.

Don't be scared.

226
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,920
Come on.

Don't do that.

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,560
Do what? Sit on the car.

332
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,520

333

Go on.
What you going to do, man?

337
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,720
Um, I want to get to the car.

338
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,080

Get out of my way.

345
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,520
BOTH LAUGH LOUDLY

346
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,720
Do you ever write lists?

347
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,040
You know, like things to do, things
to see, targets, ambitions, dreams?

348
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,520
Yeah, sometimes, I guess.

349
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,600
Let's play a game of lists -
you say something, I add to it.

350
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,000
For example,
let's list the things that we hate.

351
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,280
Why hate?

352
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,720
Because we always tell the truth
about what we hate. You go first.

353
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,880
Jazz. Religion.

354
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,000

355
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,280

368

You gotta take the game

Do you want to win? At any cost?
Yes. Yes.

Really? Really.

371
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,640
So there's nothing that
you wouldn't do to not win?

372
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,800
Within reason.
No! That's bullshit!

373
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,880
Everything has a context.
No, it doesn't.

374
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,240
It only has a context
because you need it to.

375

00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,760
Listen, Sam.

493
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,120
If I give you the money and the key,
will you give it to Alice tomorrow?

494
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,400
Why can't you do it?

495
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:40,600
In case...something happens.

496
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,840
What's that supposed to mean?
Will you do this for me?

497
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,880
What makes you think
I won't fuck off and spend it?

498
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,360
Huh?

Anyway, going back to this 'game',
who are these two men?

505
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,640
Two men?

506
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:22,120
You said you were hiding
from two men. Who are they?

507
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,640
I don't know.

508
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,440
What, they just gave you this money

509
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,280
and told you,
"Pick up the rest tomorrow"?

Yeah, something like that.

00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,520
All right. There you go, mate.

513
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,520
I'm sure I didn't tell you
it was two men.

514
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,080
What, are you suggesting
that I made it up or something?

515
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,480
How else would you have known?

516
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,480

00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,520
You...you're losing the plot, mate.
You said it.

519
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,480
No, I didn't. Yes, you did.

520
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,080
I didn't, Sam.

521
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,000

Fuck! It's not a fucking game, Sam!

531
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,320
They're going to kill me.
Do you hear?

532
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,000
Fucking kill me!

01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:20,200
How about that?

656
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,800
How about you do us all
a fucking favour,

657
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:26,840
you piece of miserable,
useless fucking shit?!

658
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:30,560
Alice.
You can't talk to me like that!

659
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,360
You can't!

660
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:34,800
I told her I don't have the money.
Put the gun down.

661
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,920
I'll pay, but I can't pay all of it.

662
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:38,640
Come on, Alice. Do something.

663
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,360
Become a somebody. Because
that's what you want, isn't it?

664
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,600
To be a star!
Stop. She's scared.

665
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:48,480
I said I'll go tomorrow and pick up
the package. I told her.

666
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,080
I said I'd do it.
Do it, Alice!

667
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,720
I said I'd go.
Come on!

668
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,600
Give it to me.

669
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,680
I said I'd...
SCREAMS

670
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:59,760
Fucking hell! Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!

671
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,640
I mean it. I fucking mean it.
Now stop!

672
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:05,520
SHE WHIMPERS
What is this?

673
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:08,080
What the fuck do you think
you're doing? Look at her.

674
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,160
Why did you do that?

675
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:14,800
Are you serious?
Oh, I am serious.

676
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,040
I am so very fucking serious.

677
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:19,200
Please do not for one moment think

678
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,480
that I'm not fucking serious,
you cunt!

679
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,520
It's over.

680
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:30,360
This...game is over.

681
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:32,960
I'm sorry.

682
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,000
You're right.

683
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,480
You're right, Jamie.

684
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,240
It's...it's got out of hand.

685
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:41,320
SHE SOBS

686
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,680
I'm sorry.

687
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:06,680
SHE CRIES: Help me, please.

688
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:09,680
SHE SOBS

689
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,560
BREATHES HEAVILY: Fuck.

690
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:14,840
CONTINUES SOBBING

691
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,360
WOMAN ON RADIO:
..And mild deflation,

692
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:30,040
and the business of creating
and destroying exchange units

693
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:31,680
is not good or evil...

694
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:42,360
I'm sorry, man. I had to stop you
in there. You were out of control.

695
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,440
I mean, you could have killed her.

696
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:48,600
Is this what normally happens -
people get hurt like that?

697
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,440
No.

698
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:53,840
And this -

699
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,880
this is real.

700
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,520
This isn't a toy.

701
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,720
Fuck's sake.
Anything could have happened.

702
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:04,600
She could have pulled the trigger.
I could have pulled the trigger.

703
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,600
Then what?
It's over now.

704
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,480
No, it's not fucking over.

705
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,080
We need to get her an ambulance.
We need to tell them what happened.

706
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,960
We need to try
to sort this mess out.

707
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:16,360
Uh, we can't do that, though.

708
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:18,240
But we don't have a choice.

709
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,560
Yes, we do. What?

710
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:23,640
We drive away from here,
we forget about what happened

711
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,240
and get on with our lives.

712
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:26,720
Oh, the job.

713
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:30,000
The job is yours, if you want it.

714
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,000
The job?

715
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:38,000
No. Fuck the job.

716
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,720
We can't just walk away from this.

717
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:46,760
Anyway, she saw us.
The kid, Sean. His friend, Sam.

718
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,240
They all saw us.

719
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:52,160
Nobody cares about what they saw.
'They' don't exist.

720
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,480
You're serious?

721
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:59,080
Do you really give a shit about her?

722
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:03,000
The truth. Tell the truth.

723
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:07,160
Do you?

724
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,800
Yes, I do.

725
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,880
LAUGHS

726
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,840
You're so fucking...

727
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:21,720
..middle-class, Jamie, so fake.

728
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:24,480
Why the fuck
would you care about her?

729
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,480
She's already dead, you...fool.

730
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,080
Oh.

731
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:34,120
Don't tell me it's about morals
and souls and fucking angels.

732
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,600
I mean, shit to that.

733
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:37,680
Shit to all of that!

734
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:40,080
LAUGHS: If you don't like
What you're see,

735
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,160
then you should do
what the good book tells you,

736
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:44,160
and pluck your
fucking eyes out, and...

737
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,680
GUNSHOT

738
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,840
..Die, you bastard.

739
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:10,040
ALICE WHIMPERS

740
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,760
Alice?

741
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:19,320
Alice?

742
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:21,400
CRIES SOFTLY

743
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,960
What did they do to you, Alice?

744
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:41,640
Alice.

745
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,960
SHE CRIES

746
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:51,120
Alice, what have they done to you?

747
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,240
SHE CRIES:
He...

748
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,520
CRIES LOUDLY

749
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,200
Shh.

750
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:04,880
Sorry.

751

SIREN WAILS

752
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:42,320
They're still here.

753
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:44,440
By the garages.

MAN: Can I help you?

756
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:51,320
SEAN: I hope so.

757
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:52,800
I'm here to meet Jamie Stewart.

758
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,760
I've got some documents
he wants dealt with today.

759
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:57,400
He asked me to meet him here
so he could sign them off.

760
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:00,000
There's no-one in this morning.

761
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,680
Uh, he is. He called me from here.

762
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:04,480
I assure you there's no-one in,
apart from me and the cleaners.

763
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,960
I'm sorry. He called me from here.

764
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:10,440
He called me out of bed,
he shouted at me.

765
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:13,400
He said Alistair would go crazy
if it wasn't done.

766
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,080
You know how he is.

767
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:17,360
I'm here. I've got the documents.

768
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:19,840
Can I go and have a look?
I'm sorry.

769
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:22,400
Like I said before, there's nobody
here. They would have passed me.

770
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,200
What, even if they
were working all night?

771
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,640
I don't think there was anyone
working late last night.

772
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:31,240
Cos, er, you'd have seen them
on your rounds, right?

773
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:33,040
Right.

774
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:38,360
Look, between you and me,

775
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:39,840
I don't give a shit.

776
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:42,640
I get paid anyway.

777
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:47,120
But if he's up there, and he
doesn't get these documents,

778
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,560
and I tell him why,

779
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,760
whoa, you can imagine
what might happen, eh?

780
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:12,040
Just wait here.
I'll go check upstairs.

781
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,520
Sure.

782
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,920
Wake me up if I fall asleep, yeah?

783
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:05,480
THUD!

784
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,360
Everything OK there, sir?

785
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,640
Sure.

786
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:48,600
There's something
hanging out of there.

787
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,160
Looks like a shirt or something.

788
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,360
The boot.

789
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:24,080

Give that over here to me.

798
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:56,360
Come on. Pass it over here to me.
Mmm, no.

799
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:59,120
No, no, no, no, no.
No. No, don't do that.

800
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,400
Look.

801
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,800
I'll swap ya.

802
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:11,160
You give me that gun,

No. Don't do that.

807
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:22,200
GIRLS CONTINUE TO GIGGLE

808
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:26,680
I'm going to have to
eat them all, then.

809
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,200
None for you.

810
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:35,240
Come on. Give me the gun.

811
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:37,080
Yeah, pass it through to me.

812

01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:43,320
SHOWER RUNS

818
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:46,760
'Out-of-control inflation
is when the Fed lends
trillions of exchange units

819
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:48,840
'at a rate faster than the bankers

820
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:50,720
'can hide them
off their balance sheet.'

821
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,240
SNAP! HE SCREAMS

822
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:46,280
ALISTAIR LAUGHS

823
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,520
BREATHES DEEPLY

824
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:32,680
LOUD CLANGING

825
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,880
CRIES OUT

826
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,040
HE SCREAMS LOUDLY

827
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:27,480
CRACK!

828
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:36,880
Look at me.

829
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:39,920
Look at me!

830
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,640
I want you to look at me.

831
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:47,800
It was fun, wasn't it?

832
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:49,440
Why me?

833
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:56,400
Why Alice?
Shh. Don't be scared.

834
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,600
HE LAUGHS

835
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,160
It's only natural.

836
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:05,560
It's just the way it is.

837
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,560
I win.

838
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:18,640
You lose.

839
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:20,680
HE LAUGHS

840
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:48,480
BANGS LOUDLY: Help!

841
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:50,480
Help!

842
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:02,480
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

843
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:20,400
GRUNTS: Fuck you!

844
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:21,880
GRUNTS

845
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:30,520
I've got it all here.

846
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:32,800
Everything's here ready to go,

847
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:35,800
to be sent to everyone
who knows you.

848
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:37,440
They'll see what you've been doing.

849
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:39,680
The others.

850
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:41,240
All the others.

851
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:45,640
You hunted them
and you killed them.

852
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:48,880
Come away from there.

853
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:55,480
Let's, er...let's talk about it.

854
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:57,480
Do a deal. What do you think?

855
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:10,760
Put the gun down

856
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:13,160
and step away from me.

857
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:36,680
How much do you need?

858
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:43,880
Why did you do that to my sister?

859
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:48,840
Oh, I can give you
more money than you ever dreamed of.

860
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:52,440
I can do that quickly.

861
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,000
I need to know.

862
01:25:57,760 --> 01:25:59,680
It doesn't matter now.

863
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:02,320
Oh, no, it does.

864
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,640
It really does.

865
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:08,120
Do we have a deal?

866
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:11,040
If you tell me.

867
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:18,560
I did it because...

868
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:21,800
Yeah?

869
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,760
..because I could.

870
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:34,080
And that was it? No other reason?

871
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:40,160
All this tonight...
because you could.

872
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,640
Let's make you rich.

873
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:59,080
Do...the...deal.

874
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:07,720
No.

875
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:43,160
LAUGHS

876
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:47,880
CONTINUES LAUGHING

877
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:20,080
SONG: # Half the kids
That you grew up with

878
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:23,240
# Were pushing prams by the time
that they were just 16

879
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:28,720
# If love is a drug
then where is the cure

880
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:32,280
# For the girl who used
to talk to you about her dream?

881
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:37,280
# And all the boys
with all their toys

882
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:40,920
# Couldn't see the signs as we
scorched out eyes with nicotine

883
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:46,240
# And the grown-up said
Listen to your heads

884
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:49,960
# But our hearts were crying out
for heroes on TV screens

885
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:56,800
# Now this song is about you

886
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:06,000
# Now this song is about

887
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,800
# Changes in your mind

888
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:15,000
# Changes in your life

889
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,800
# Changes in the times

890
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:22,120
# And the reason
you can't sleep at night

891
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:26,560
# Changes in your mind

892
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:32,600
# Changes in your life

893
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:35,480
# Changes in the times

894
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:39,600
# And the reason
you gave up the fight... #

895
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:08,720
SAM: It's all there.

896
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:10,280
I didn't touch a penny.

897
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:34,520
Alice is at the hospital.

898
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:37,160
She's going to be OK.

899
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:40,000
I spoke to her.

900
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,480
I didn't know, Sean.

901
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:46,360
They gave me some money.
told me it was a game.

902
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:49,240
I didn't know
they were going to do that.

903
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:50,800
I'm so sorry.

904
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:01,480
I'm so sorry.

905
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:15,160
