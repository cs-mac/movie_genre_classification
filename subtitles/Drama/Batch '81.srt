1
00:00:14,497 --> 00:00:16,590
Stop the music!

2
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:21,431
- What's up, duck?
- What's up?! I'll tell you what's up.

3
00:00:21,638 --> 00:00:25,369
I'm taking charge here,
that's what's up.

4
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:30,880
Fifty years of you hogging
the spotlight is enough.

5
00:00:31,514 --> 00:00:34,278
I am riding the shield from now on...

6
00:00:34,484 --> 00:00:39,114
...because I, personally,
have all the talent around here.

7
00:00:39,322 --> 00:00:42,485
Okay, mac, let's take it from the top.

8
00:00:42,892 --> 00:00:44,416
Okay, far enough.

9
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:48,154
Now then. Camera! Music! Sound!

10
00:00:53,737 --> 00:00:56,297
Very funny.

11
00:00:56,606 --> 00:01:00,440
You may expect to hear
from my attorneys.

12
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:17,556
If I'm not gonna star in this cartoon,
let's just start the movie.

13
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:19,285
Roll 'em!

14
00:03:10,874 --> 00:03:12,501
Mr. Wing?

15
00:03:18,581 --> 00:03:22,278
Daniel Clamp would like
to speak to you.

16
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:36,895
<i>Good morning, Mr. Wing.</i>
<i>Let's cut right to key issues, okay?</i>

17
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,230
<i>I'll increase my offer substantially.</i>

18
00:03:40,436 --> 00:03:44,270
<i>You're attached to your business.</i>
<i>I appreciate that.</i>

19
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:49,207
<i>I'm attached to mine. I develop</i>
<i>the biggest buildings in New York.</i>

20
00:03:49,412 --> 00:03:51,243
<i>And you sell...</i>

21
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:55,977
<i>... little things.</i>
<i>That's fine. Take a look.</i>

22
00:03:56,185 --> 00:04:01,020
<i>"The Clamp Chinatown Centre,</i>
<i>where business gets Oriented. "</i>

23
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:05,227
<i>You're the only holdout.</i>
<i>Here's what I'll do for you:</i>

24
00:04:05,428 --> 00:04:08,864
<i>A newsstand and souvenir concession</i>
<i>in the atrium.</i>

25
00:04:09,065 --> 00:04:11,033
<i>This building will be modern...</i>

26
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:15,170
<i>... from voice-activated elevators</i>
<i>to self-cleaning ashtrays.</i>

27
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:19,808
<i>I'm really excited about it,</i>
<i>and I'd hate to see you miss out.</i>

28
00:04:21,044 --> 00:04:24,502
<i>Please, let us know</i>
<i>when you've made a decision.</i>

29
00:04:24,714 --> 00:04:28,775
<i>You know, I believe there's</i>
<i>always an area of agreement...</i>

30
00:04:28,985 --> 00:04:31,351
<i>... that two people can reach.</i>

31
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:39,157
Yes. A man can always
agree with others.

32
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:43,992
It is more difficult
to agree with oneself.

33
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,295
That's very charming.

34
00:04:46,502 --> 00:04:48,060
Confucius...

35
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:50,136
...or Bruce Lee?

36
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,812
I'm sorry. Please tell Mr. Clamp...

37
00:04:58,014 --> 00:05:01,211
...that the answer is still no.

38
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,712
Please...

39
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,380
...keep the TV.

40
00:05:11,427 --> 00:05:13,088
TV!

41
00:05:21,504 --> 00:05:23,267
Rambo.

42
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:33,348
<i>To survive a war,</i>
<i>you gotta become war.</i>

43
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,581
Television again.

44
00:05:39,989 --> 00:05:43,049
An invention for fools!

45
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:54,693
I'm sorry that didn't work out.
Mr. Clamp's offer was generous.

46
00:05:54,904 --> 00:05:58,271
Did you hear that cough?
He's an antique.

47
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,107
We can wait.

48
00:06:00,476 --> 00:06:03,468
<i>I'm Daniel Clamp.</i>
<i>No New York visit is complete...</i>

49
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:08,609
<i>... without touring the world's</i>
<i>most automated building:</i>

50
00:06:08,818 --> 00:06:12,777
<i>Clamp Premiere Regency</i>
<i>Trade Centre and Retail Concourse.</i>

51
00:06:12,989 --> 00:06:15,822
<i>Headquarters of Clamp Enterprises...</i>

52
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:18,391
<i>... and CCN, Clamp Cable Network.</i>

53
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,533
<i>Mr. Wing's death removes</i>
<i>the last obstacle...</i>

54
00:06:25,735 --> 00:06:29,136
<i>... to developer Daniel Clamp's</i>
<i>long-delayed project.</i>

55
00:06:29,338 --> 00:06:33,274
<i>This quaint shop, which once</i>
<i>housed rare Oriental objects...</i>

56
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:36,808
<i>... now makes way for the future,</i>
<i>Daniel Clamp style.</i>

57
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,136
Lewis, it's like I've always said:

58
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:47,044
"If you want to find something weird,
you have to go downtown."

59
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:56,180
The Futtermans come to town tomorrow.

60
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:59,884
Mr. Futterman must be better
if he can travel.

61
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:03,395
His wife says he is better.
He was just rattled.

62
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,468
Having monsters drive a snowplow
through your house will do that.

63
00:08:08,671 --> 00:08:10,764
Well, he was almost killed.

64
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:16,033
- These people are so rude!
- Honey, what time is it?

65
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,577
God, we're late. There's a cab.

66
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:32,258
- You going airport?
- No. Actually, I'm just...

67
00:08:35,998 --> 00:08:39,229
After all this time,
I'm still in the same job.

68
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,868
It takes time, Billy.

69
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:44,562
In Kingston Falls,
I'd have been promoted by now.

70
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,207
And you'd hate it.

71
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:51,039
At least we could afford a decent
place to live. Get married.

72
00:08:53,382 --> 00:08:55,976
<i>Welcome to the Clamp Entry-matic...</i>

73
00:08:56,185 --> 00:09:00,417
<i>... a revolution in revolving door</i>
<i>precision and efficiency.</i>

74
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:14,865
<i>Please be careful in stepping in</i>
<i>and out, and have a powerful day.</i>

75
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:22,109
That's the story of the
Clamp Premiere Regency Centre...

76
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:25,246
...where one man's dream
became a reality.

77
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:28,576
I hope you enjoyed today's tour.
Don't forget:

78
00:09:28,784 --> 00:09:32,777
Pick up Mr. Clamp's best-selling
book, <i>I Took Manhattan...</i>

79
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,686
...on sale right here
at our newsstand for only 19.95.

80
00:09:36,892 --> 00:09:38,416
And in our gift store...

81
00:09:38,628 --> 00:09:40,562
Don't let them get to you.

82
00:09:40,763 --> 00:09:45,462
Billy, you're so good at your job.
Sooner or later, they'll notice.

83
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:49,160
- Maybe then we can get married.
- Okay, hon.

84
00:09:49,872 --> 00:09:51,863
- Bye.
- Bye.

85
00:09:52,074 --> 00:09:55,510
- Marla, the first plan...
- The deadline's not my fault.

86
00:09:55,711 --> 00:10:00,171
They make me miserable, so I make
you miserable. It's a disaster.

87
00:10:00,383 --> 00:10:03,113
They changed the specs
and the deadline...

88
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:08,382
See, this is your problem right here.
You only see your little part of it.

89
00:10:08,591 --> 00:10:12,891
I need a complete situational,
long-term, overview perspective.

90
00:10:13,095 --> 00:10:16,861
It's almost finished.
I just have a few adjustments...

91
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:20,695
The courtyard looks cold.
It'd be better with trees.

92
00:10:20,903 --> 00:10:23,736
- Will they plant trees?
- No. But draw them.

93
00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:25,270
- But the...
- Elms.

94
00:10:25,474 --> 00:10:29,877
- But the shrubbery looks...
- This attitude doesn't work for me.

95
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,910
Good morning, Mr. Forster.

96
00:10:32,114 --> 00:10:37,643
It looks like somebody hasn't read
his employee manual. Doesn't it, Mr...

97
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:39,343
<i>- Peltzer.</i>
...Peltzer?

98
00:10:39,622 --> 00:10:43,649
- Unauthorized potted plant.
- I told him about it weeks ago.

99
00:10:43,859 --> 00:10:46,851
- I talked to you!
- I know. I was gonna...

100
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,361
Possible aphid infestation.

101
00:10:49,865 --> 00:10:54,063
- What's this?
- That's Kingston Falls. My hometown.

102
00:10:55,805 --> 00:10:59,832
Do you know how much
the Clamp organization has spent...

103
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:04,376
...to provide its employees
with art by recognized artists...

104
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:10,075
...at this facility? Eye-pleasing,
color-coordinated, authorized.

105
00:11:10,486 --> 00:11:14,149
- But it was just a little...
- A little touch. I know.

106
00:11:14,357 --> 00:11:17,815
Maybe everybody here
wants to do a little touch.

107
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:21,326
Coffee mugs that say,
"World's Greatest Lover."

108
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:26,433
The ashtray that reads, "Rest Your
Butt Here." You'd like that, right?

109
00:11:26,635 --> 00:11:31,129
Coming to work every day
in a $200,000,000...

110
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,274
...flea market.

111
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:39,378
Billy, this is just
what I don't need right now.

112
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:46,581
The department review's in three weeks.
It's a nuclear meltdown disaster.

113
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:52,250
- Marla, I am doing the best I can.
- Billy, do me a favor.

114
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:54,358
Do better!

115
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:58,092
We've got a low corrosivity reading.

116
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,326
Give me a wave form on 10th power.

117
00:12:02,571 --> 00:12:05,904
Mr. Forster, I have
a potential violator, sir.

118
00:12:18,721 --> 00:12:23,954
That's an unauthorized break period,
friend. You don't work here anymore.

119
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:30,198
Do we have a problem communicating?
You're gone. Terminated.

120
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,166
End of medical benefits, that's right.
Clean out the desk, one hour.

121
00:12:35,571 --> 00:12:36,970
And thanks so much.

122
00:12:39,575 --> 00:12:41,702
Very nice, Frances.

123
00:12:42,812 --> 00:12:47,146
Alert personnel. We have a
career opportunity in level seven.

124
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:51,479
Clamp Centre is the most advanced
smart building in America...

125
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:56,147
...with the latest in security,
communications and climate control.

126
00:12:56,358 --> 00:13:00,590
It's just one part of Mr. Clamp's
worldwide business network...

127
00:13:00,796 --> 00:13:03,856
...which includes construction,
sports, finance...

128
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:06,899
...and a popular line
of jams and jellies.

129
00:13:07,102 --> 00:13:09,536
For those with cable TV at home...

130
00:13:09,738 --> 00:13:13,174
...CCN is located right here
in the building.

131
00:13:20,182 --> 00:13:23,640
<i>The Attack of the Octopus People.</i>

132
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:28,185
That's tonight's movie.
And, boy, is it scary.

133
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,325
It's so scary,
it'll uncross your eyes.

134
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:36,692
It's a good thing that your
Grandpa Fred is here to protect you.

135
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,459
- Where's the moan?
- The what?

136
00:13:39,668 --> 00:13:43,729
There's supposed to be a moan here
from the coffin.

137
00:13:43,939 --> 00:13:47,272
Then I say, "Renfield,
you want more flies?"

138
00:13:47,476 --> 00:13:50,707
And then I go over
to the coffin and I...

139
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,574
Sorry, Fred.

140
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:55,181
- Hey, Fred.
- Oh, hi, Billy.

141
00:13:55,384 --> 00:13:59,980
I heard about your new time slot.
They're making a big mistake.

142
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:02,453
Mistake? Kid, it's a disaster.

143
00:14:02,658 --> 00:14:06,594
People who watch TV at 3:30 a.m.
Don't fear the Wolfman.

144
00:14:06,795 --> 00:14:10,424
What scares them is getting sober
and finding work.

145
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:13,033
- Look.
- Watch it with that thing.

146
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:15,032
- Isn't that great?
- Sure.

147
00:14:15,304 --> 00:14:20,469
- You could use it on your show.
- Sure. Put it in the back, will you?

148
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,540
Frankly, kid...

149
00:14:25,414 --> 00:14:27,848
...this isn't what I had in mind.

150
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:34,017
I went into broadcasting,
I thought I was gonna do news...

151
00:14:34,223 --> 00:14:36,157
...public affairs...

152
00:14:36,358 --> 00:14:38,519
...something meaningful.

153
00:14:39,595 --> 00:14:41,586
I don't even have a gimmick.

154
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,958
No special effects.

155
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:50,105
All I have is a cross-eyed
puppet named lgor.

156
00:14:52,074 --> 00:14:53,974
<i>The elevator doors have opened.</i>

157
00:14:54,176 --> 00:14:58,636
You should run classic horror movies
like <i>Frankenstein</i> or <i>Dracula.</i>

158
00:14:58,847 --> 00:15:03,875
Great horror movies are in black
and white. Mr. Clamp only likes color.

159
00:15:04,086 --> 00:15:05,519
That guy's strange.

160
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:08,087
- Have you seen him?
- Not in person.

161
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:11,657
Only on that cockamamie video
they got all over.

162
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:16,593
Look at this building. You know
what kind of tenants they have now?

163
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,098
There's a genetic research
laboratory upstairs.

164
00:15:20,302 --> 00:15:22,361
Fooling around with animals.

165
00:15:22,571 --> 00:15:27,736
Last week, they took out a patent
on a new kind of gerbil.

166
00:15:27,943 --> 00:15:29,706
People think I'm creepy.

167
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:53,467
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

168
00:15:53,669 --> 00:15:58,538
- I got a delivery for Dr. Catheter.
- I can sign for it.

169
00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:03,141
What kind of stuff
do they do in there anyway?

170
00:16:03,345 --> 00:16:05,905
We're not supposed to talk about it.

171
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,850
Oh, I'm sorry.

172
00:16:10,452 --> 00:16:15,913
- Dr. Catheter, this just came for you.
- Splendid. This must be my malaria.

173
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:23,155
Just rabies. I've got rabies.
I'm supposed to get the flu this week.

174
00:16:23,365 --> 00:16:26,334
I think we have the flu on back order.

175
00:16:27,136 --> 00:16:30,333
- Could I have that, Peggy?
- Oh, yes. Sure.

176
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:31,870
Thank you.

177
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:38,206
Back order. Back order.
All a man wants is some fresh germs.

178
00:16:41,316 --> 00:16:44,513
Casper, have this tissue analyzed.

179
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:54,422
<i>I am calm and centered.</i>
<i>I enjoy giving milk.</i>

180
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,224
- Martin.
- Hello, doctor.

181
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,561
- How's the cloning coming along?
- Really well.

182
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:04,136
- Lewis.
- We got something for you to look at.

183
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:08,708
It's interesting. I found it
downtown on my specimen scout.

184
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:14,406
It's some sort of rodent, apparently.
And it seems allergic to bright light.

185
00:17:26,428 --> 00:17:30,296
- Cute, isn't it?
- That may be genetic.

186
00:17:30,499 --> 00:17:33,093
- We're not sure yet.
- We're not sure.

187
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,770
Watch this, doctor.

188
00:18:03,132 --> 00:18:05,032
He likes this music?

189
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:07,429
- Yes.
- It's his favorite.

190
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,533
Not so fast, my boy.

191
00:18:15,778 --> 00:18:20,044
- You nearly let him get away.
- Sorry, sir.

192
00:18:22,584 --> 00:18:26,247
- How do you plan to proceed?
- Cell samples tomorrow.

193
00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:30,516
- Tissue cultures Thursday.
- And then there's body structure.

194
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,860
And for that, my little friend...

195
00:18:35,998 --> 00:18:39,399
...we'll just have to cut you.

196
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:46,000
I can't believe she told me to put
trees on that drawing. It just...

197
00:18:46,775 --> 00:18:48,174
My light went out.

198
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:52,211
<i>You sat still, so the building</i>
<i>thinks you left. Move.</i>

199
00:18:52,414 --> 00:18:54,348
Okay, hold on.

200
00:18:57,486 --> 00:19:00,819
You're right, I need...
Hello? Hello?

201
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:06,753
Honey? Hello?
Kate, are you there? Kate?

202
00:19:08,497 --> 00:19:10,965
Nothing works around here.

203
00:19:18,607 --> 00:19:21,667
Excuse me? Where'd you hear that?

204
00:19:22,144 --> 00:19:24,840
- What?
- That music. Where'd you hear it?

205
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:33,380
- Isn't that by Sting?
- No. It's not by Sting. Think.

206
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:38,288
Oh, wait, I know. I was up
in that laboratory. You know, on 51.

207
00:19:38,493 --> 00:19:40,893
And somebody was humming it.

208
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:53,171
Hi, I hear your copier's down.

209
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,865
- Oh, it is?
- Yeah.

210
00:19:55,077 --> 00:19:57,978
- It's back there.
- Thank you.

211
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,779
We're ready, doctor.

212
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,921
This is the most interesting
bioelectrical work I've done.

213
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:20,727
Just think. Millions of rats in
New York, and everyone hates them.

214
00:20:20,936 --> 00:20:25,339
But if one of them could power
a portable radio for a month...

215
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,303
Gizmo, I'm here.

216
00:20:33,048 --> 00:20:35,141
Watch this, doctor.

217
00:20:37,252 --> 00:20:39,743
Definite progress, gentlemen.

218
00:20:48,297 --> 00:20:49,787
Be quiet.

219
00:20:53,635 --> 00:20:57,093
If only we could make it safe
to touch them.

220
00:20:57,773 --> 00:21:01,402
Still, they'd be good
in flashlights, wouldn't they?

221
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,477
Where there's flashlights,
there's dark.

222
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,614
And they like the dark.

223
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:12,914
- Theodore! How'd you get out?
- Alvin, put down that DNA!

224
00:21:21,229 --> 00:21:25,325
<i>Mister, welcome to the men's room.</i>

225
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:32,233
<i>Hey, pal, I sure hope</i>
<i>you washed those hands.</i>

226
00:21:55,998 --> 00:21:59,331
Hey, guy, how you doing?

227
00:21:59,534 --> 00:22:01,365
Did you miss me?

228
00:22:03,171 --> 00:22:05,105
Yeah. Me too.

229
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:16,707
So, what are you doing here?
What were those guys doing to you?

230
00:22:17,953 --> 00:22:19,420
Wow. That bad, huh?

231
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:24,825
You wanna come out?
Come here. It's okay.

232
00:22:25,027 --> 00:22:28,394
Come with me. I got you.
I'll take care of you.

233
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,724
Everything's gonna be fine.

234
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:34,026
- What is this? A black armband?
- Armband.

235
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:38,237
Is that what happened to the man
who took care of you?

236
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:53,383
You've got to be quiet. You don't want
to go back to the laboratory, do you?

237
00:22:53,588 --> 00:22:57,615
So do me a favor.
Get down there and don't say anything.

238
00:22:57,826 --> 00:23:01,523
I'll come back and take you home
as soon as possible.

239
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,893
Okay, that's a good boy. Bye-bye.

240
00:23:06,435 --> 00:23:08,096
It's him! He's here!

241
00:23:09,438 --> 00:23:13,670
Oh, Giz, I'm so sorry.
Are you okay? How's your hand?

242
00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:17,139
Look, he's here. You have to get down.

243
00:23:19,948 --> 00:23:25,181
I'm Marla Bloodstone, the department
head here. If there's anything I can...

244
00:23:25,387 --> 00:23:28,982
That's okay. Everybody just relax.

245
00:23:29,191 --> 00:23:32,126
Go on about what you'd
be doing normally.

246
00:23:33,128 --> 00:23:37,895
I know I haven't been here before,
but that'll change. I'll be more...

247
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,160
...hands-on with these
operations from now on.

248
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:46,634
- This is excellent!
- Isn't that terrific?

249
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:50,369
You've captured the whole
essence of the project.

250
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:54,913
Look at the kids with the kites.
That's warmth. I like warmth.

251
00:23:55,117 --> 00:23:58,382
- What's your name?
- Billy. William Peltzer, sir.

252
00:23:58,587 --> 00:24:02,489
Bill, huh? That's what we need here:
People who produce.

253
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:07,594
Lose those trees, though. With elm,
people think "Dutch," "disease."

254
00:24:07,796 --> 00:24:09,764
- Absolutely.
- Absolutely.

255
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:12,658
What's with that drawer?

256
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:17,664
It's automatic. It opens now and then
in case you need something.

257
00:24:22,444 --> 00:24:24,878
I didn't know about that.

258
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:30,340
- Hey! What's that?
- Did you hear that?

259
00:24:30,585 --> 00:24:33,110
"People who produce."

260
00:24:33,321 --> 00:24:36,347
He called you Bill. This is very big.

261
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:41,222
This is a career opportunity
advancement window. For both of us.

262
00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:46,025
- Do you really think so?
- Clearly. We can talk at dinner.

263
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,202
- Great. Sometime next...
- Tonight.

264
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,928
- I can't.
- I have something too.

265
00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:53,630
A brochure for the Archery Channel.

266
00:24:53,842 --> 00:24:57,369
It's a total suicide,
red-alert, deadline emergency.

267
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:01,538
You know what? I'm letting it go
to have dinner with you.

268
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,685
I just can't leave
on such short notice.

269
00:25:04,886 --> 00:25:07,354
What is with that drawer, Billy?

270
00:25:07,556 --> 00:25:11,048
- You keeping a pet in there?
- I'm allergic to pets.

271
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:14,695
It's good Mr. Clamp likes you
because... Let me see.

272
00:25:14,896 --> 00:25:17,524
Maybe tonight would be the best.

273
00:25:17,732 --> 00:25:22,863
There's a chic new Canadian restaurant.
They clean the fish at your table.

274
00:25:23,071 --> 00:25:27,371
- Really? That sounds terrific.
- Just let me grab my bag.

275
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,603
Now, listen. I have to go.

276
00:25:30,812 --> 00:25:34,714
I'll send someone to pick you up.
So just stay put.

277
00:25:39,421 --> 00:25:40,786
- Billy.
- Yeah...

278
00:25:42,857 --> 00:25:44,324
Ready?

279
00:25:47,229 --> 00:25:49,322
Yeah. Sure, I'm ready.

280
00:25:50,699 --> 00:25:54,430
We may see Woody.
They say he eats there incessantly.

281
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:12,719
- Katie?
- Hi, honey. I'm almost ready.

282
00:26:12,921 --> 00:26:15,355
- I just gotta punch out.
- Hi.

283
00:26:15,557 --> 00:26:19,186
I'm not able to go out
with you tonight. I'm sorry.

284
00:26:19,394 --> 00:26:23,330
- I've got a meeting with some people.
- A meeting? Great.

285
00:26:23,531 --> 00:26:26,466
Listen, I got a big favor
to ask of you.

286
00:26:27,402 --> 00:26:31,702
- Gizmo's here and he...
- That furry thing?

287
00:26:31,906 --> 00:26:34,397
Yeah. He's up in my desk drawer.

288
00:26:34,609 --> 00:26:37,510
Don't do that.
I hate it when you do that.

289
00:26:37,712 --> 00:26:40,704
There's good news.
You get to take him home.

290
00:26:40,915 --> 00:26:44,214
- Take him home? Our home?
- Yes.

291
00:26:47,455 --> 00:26:48,979
- No!
- Why not?

292
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,954
What if they start
running around New York?

293
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,357
They won't, I promise.
Just obey the rules.

294
00:26:55,563 --> 00:26:57,895
- The rules!
- Remember the first one?

295
00:26:58,099 --> 00:27:02,035
Don't expose them to bright light
because it kills them.

296
00:27:02,237 --> 00:27:05,138
- The second rule...
- Don't let them get wet?

297
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,329
Right!

298
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:09,999
The third one is, don't
let them eat after midnight.

299
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,475
- That's very good, honey.
- Wait!

300

<i>full color with a happier ending.</i>

302
00:27:30,965 --> 00:27:35,766
With Clamp's annual salary, if he goes
to the bathroom for 30 seconds...

303
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:39,599
...the man's earning $375
while he stands there.

304
00:27:39,808 --> 00:27:42,572
What can he do?
Can he fix an elevator?

305
00:27:42,777 --> 00:27:45,610
What does it cost
the company for me...

306
00:27:45,814 --> 00:27:48,578
...to get a drink of water,
.0003 cents?

307
00:27:50,985 --> 00:27:55,922
I tell you... A taste
of the wrench for you, my friend.

308
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:02,055
I said not to put new units in.
They don't listen.

309
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:06,859
They listen to that guy they pay
$375 to go to the bathroom.

310
00:28:07,068 --> 00:28:09,559
I remember the Sip-master Mark IV.

311
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:15,767
That was a fabulous drinking fountain.
You could squirt it six months...

312
00:28:15,977 --> 00:28:18,810
...and it'd still
be shooting straight.

313
00:28:19,981 --> 00:28:23,075
But those dancing days are done.

314
00:28:41,202 --> 00:28:42,999
The hell with it.

315
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:07,777
I'm not being paranoid.
The guy's after my job.

316
00:30:07,989 --> 00:30:10,924
That's how it is these days.
All politics.

317
00:30:11,626 --> 00:30:14,322
It's the law of the jungle
around here.

318
00:30:14,529 --> 00:30:18,556
Young guys only care
about one thing, okay? Power.

319
00:30:18,766 --> 00:30:21,098
I'm talking about ruthless.

320
00:30:27,942 --> 00:30:30,410
Gizmo, ca-ca!

321
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:20,020
<i>Will the owner of the car</i>
<i>with license number 1 AG401...</i>

322
00:31:20,228 --> 00:31:25,393
<i>... please remove it from the parking</i>
<i>garage? Your car is old and dirty.</i>

323
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,366
<i>- State your desired floor number.</i>
- Forty-six, please.

324
00:31:33,374 --> 00:31:37,242
<i>The elevator doors have opened.</i>
<i>Please leave.</i>

325
00:31:54,095 --> 00:31:55,153
Gizmo.

326
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:01,769
How'd you get up there?

327
00:32:04,305 --> 00:32:07,468
Billy said to take you home,
so I'm just...

328
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:11,441
I'll put you in my purse
until we're out of the building.

329
00:32:13,081 --> 00:32:15,049
Hello.

330
00:32:15,249 --> 00:32:16,910
Here we go.

331
00:32:17,118 --> 00:32:20,178
Gizmo, you're so hyper.

332
00:32:20,388 --> 00:32:23,186
I guess New York does that to people.

333
00:32:23,391 --> 00:32:26,519
Okay, here we go.

334
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,406
Legs.

335
00:33:00,995 --> 00:33:04,863
So did you always know
you wanted to be an artist?

336
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:07,057
I always knew I liked to draw.

337
00:33:07,268 --> 00:33:11,364
When I was a kid, I drew comics.
I had this box of crayons...

338
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:12,937
I had crayons!

339
00:33:13,141 --> 00:33:17,475
I used them to write memos
to the other kids. Even then, I knew.

340
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,647
That's really something.

341
00:33:19,847 --> 00:33:25,251
We're finally getting to know each
other. You can't do that in an office.

342
00:33:25,453 --> 00:33:27,944
- It's all business.
- Exactly!

343
00:33:28,156 --> 00:33:32,149
Let's talk about your relationship
to Mr. Clamp. Your access.

344
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,592
I see a future. I see corner offices,
embossed letterhead.

345
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:39,596
I see us swallowing
the publicity department.

346
00:33:39,901 --> 00:33:42,734
Really? Wow...

347
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:46,395
Gosh. I'm feeling so vulnerable
with you, Billy.

348
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:49,770
I've never talked
about these feelings before.

349
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:54,605
When art and business join forces,
anything can happen.

350
00:33:54,816 --> 00:33:58,013
I definitely feel we should join...

351
00:33:59,587 --> 00:34:01,487
...forces.

352
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,289
Sir?

353
00:34:03,491 --> 00:34:06,426
This is a Canadian dessert,
chocolate mousse.

354
00:34:06,694 --> 00:34:08,821
Can I cut you an antler?

355
00:34:09,363 --> 00:34:10,694
No, thank you.

356
00:34:10,898 --> 00:34:13,890
You okay? You want another Molson?

357
00:34:14,102 --> 00:34:16,400
No, thanks. Really, I'm fine.

358
00:34:16,604 --> 00:34:19,937
I gotta go. I got this appointment.
I'm in a hurry.

359
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:23,542
- I'm sorry about your stocking.
- That's okay, Billy.

360
00:34:24,011 --> 00:34:26,809
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah, great.

361
00:34:28,783 --> 00:34:30,341
How about some horn?

362
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,710
Okay, Gizmo.

363
00:34:33,554 --> 00:34:39,151
Billy said to feed you before
midnight. He didn't say what you like.

364
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:43,660
I hope this is okay.
It's chicken and mashed potatoes...

365
00:34:44,265 --> 00:34:45,892
Oh, God!

366
00:34:52,607 --> 00:34:56,668
Try to be a little more careful
around here, okay?

367
00:34:56,878 --> 00:34:59,847
We don't have money to replace things.

368
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,240
There you go.

369
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:20,100
- What are you...?
- Bingo!

370
00:35:20,301 --> 00:35:21,393
Yikes!

371
00:35:37,018 --> 00:35:40,078
- Who is it?
- Open up, honey. It's me.

372
00:35:43,491 --> 00:35:46,085
- Hey. Sorry I'm late.
- Hi.

373
00:35:46,294 --> 00:35:47,955
It's okay.

374
00:35:48,162 --> 00:35:49,754
What happened to you?

375
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,763
How was your meeting?

376
00:35:52,967 --> 00:35:55,435
It was fine. Where's Gizmo?

377
00:35:55,703 --> 00:35:59,264
- He's in the kitchen.
- Great. Did you feed him?

378
00:35:59,473 --> 00:36:01,634
- Sort of.
- Giz, guess who's...

379
00:36:01,843 --> 00:36:04,334
- Bulls-eye!
...home.

380
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,880
Gizmo?

381
00:36:12,153 --> 00:36:15,520
- Where'd you find him?
- Your office, where you said.

382
00:36:15,723 --> 00:36:17,588
This is not Gizmo.

383
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:25,965
- We have to go back.
- You said no more...

384
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:29,568
There won't be,
if they don't eat after midnight.

385
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,328
But look at him.

386
00:36:31,539 --> 00:36:33,598
He's wired.

387
00:36:37,011 --> 00:36:39,206
We have to take him with us.

388
00:36:39,413 --> 00:36:40,903
No...

389
00:36:42,383 --> 00:36:45,648
- Honey, get my bag!
- Okay.

390
00:36:52,193 --> 00:36:54,787
- Great.
- Who could that be? It's late.

391
00:36:54,996 --> 00:36:57,624
- Should I get it?
- You better get it.

392
00:36:59,066 --> 00:37:02,001
- Lf you wanna get out, be quiet.
- Who is it?

393
00:37:02,203 --> 00:37:03,261
That's better.

394
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,632
Surprise!

395
00:37:06,107 --> 00:37:10,407
Mr. And Mrs. Futterman!
Weren't you coming tomorrow?

396
00:37:10,611 --> 00:37:14,877
The guys in my old outfit
changed the reunion date.

397
00:37:15,082 --> 00:37:18,381
- We had to get on a Greyhound.
- Thirty-two hours.

398
00:37:18,586 --> 00:37:21,555
- Sorry for coming so late.
- That's okay.

399
00:37:21,756 --> 00:37:24,054
Can I get you coffee or tea?

400
00:37:24,258 --> 00:37:28,217
- Little piggers!
- Oh, yeah, the cake blew up.

401
00:37:28,429 --> 00:37:32,388
Billy, this is some crazy city.
We tried to get a cab.

402
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,398
You know they got Russians
driving cabs?

403
00:37:35,603 --> 00:37:40,199
What if someone got in with
a briefcase full of atomic secrets?

404
00:37:40,408 --> 00:37:46,369
Murray, remember what Dr. Kaplan said.
We're going to be nice and calm.

405
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:50,778
He was a little distressed after
what happened with those...

406
00:37:50,985 --> 00:37:53,146
I'm fine. I'm fine.

407
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:57,290
I was jumpy for a while, that's all.
What was that?

408
00:37:58,626 --> 00:38:01,618
It's all right, dear. I heard it too.

409
00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:03,421
Of course you did!

410
00:38:03,631 --> 00:38:08,091
The thing is, you can't stay tonight.
I'd love it if you could.

411
00:38:08,302 --> 00:38:11,465
It's just, the building is being...

412
00:38:11,672 --> 00:38:13,731
...fumigated.
- Being renovated.

413
00:38:13,941 --> 00:38:16,068
- Mice and stuff.
- Rats.

414
00:38:16,277 --> 00:38:19,474
No sweat. We'll book into a hotel.

415
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,309
- You know, mice and bugs...
- Hey, that's okay.

416
00:38:23,517 --> 00:38:27,419
You can't be too careful.
There's all kinds of foreign bugs.

417
00:38:27,621 --> 00:38:29,851
Your mom baked you an apple pie.

418
00:38:31,459 --> 00:38:32,585
Thanks.

419
00:38:32,793 --> 00:38:36,058
Someone sat on it.
I'm sure it'll taste okay.

420
00:38:36,263 --> 00:38:40,791
Your dad's got some new inventions.
Reversible toilet paper.

421
00:38:41,002 --> 00:38:43,903
We'll call you tomorrow
and have dinner.

422
00:38:44,105 --> 00:38:46,437
- Okay, great.
- Good! Marvelous.

423
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,938
- Tomorrow.
- Bye. I'm sorry.

424
00:38:49,143 --> 00:38:51,907
- That's okay.
- Welcome to New York!

425
00:38:59,286 --> 00:39:03,552
Okay, that's a Kona praline
with kiwis and peanut butter cups?

426
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:06,693
Wait. Are the
peanut butter cups all-natural?

427
00:39:06,894 --> 00:39:10,421
I'm not sure. Are the
peanut butter cups all-natural?

428
00:39:10,631 --> 00:39:12,758
I know they're pesticide-free.

429
00:39:12,967 --> 00:39:15,800
It's not the same.
They put other things in.

430
00:39:16,003 --> 00:39:18,267
It comes off when they roast them.

431
00:39:18,472 --> 00:39:20,906
Roasting is the worst.

432
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:24,566
Where they don't roast,
they have 70<i>%</i> less death.

433
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,747
Sure that isn't pickling?

434
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:30,405
How can you work with this
and not read studies?

435
00:39:31,052 --> 00:39:33,247
It's a rat!

436
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:36,014
- Oh, my God!
- What's going on?

437
00:39:36,223 --> 00:39:38,384
- Did she say there are rats?
- No rats.

438
00:39:38,592 --> 00:39:40,321
That's not what she said.

439
00:39:43,564 --> 00:39:48,763
<i>The Clamp Entry-matic doors are being</i>
<i>upgraded to serve you better.</i>

440
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:53,770
<i>Please use the manual doors</i>
<i>for your entering and exiting needs.</i>

441
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:59,412
A head came up, with big ears.
There was a thing in the topping.

442
00:39:59,613 --> 00:40:02,548
- What kind of thing?
- A furry thing.

443
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:05,514
It's supposed to be health food.

444
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:06,981
I want damages!

445
00:40:07,188 --> 00:40:10,783
- They've eaten after midnight.
- Come on.

446
00:40:12,593 --> 00:40:14,993
Sorry I brought the wrong one home.

447
00:40:15,196 --> 00:40:19,326
It's my fault. I shouldn't have left
Gizmo. We gotta find him.

448
00:40:19,533 --> 00:40:21,398
It's along here.

449
00:40:21,602 --> 00:40:25,333
There. That's where the water
comes into the building.

450
00:40:40,955 --> 00:40:42,445
Give me video.

451
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,517
Security.

452
00:40:52,133 --> 00:40:55,034
At least we can keep them
from getting wet.

453
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:59,898
Hold it! Get the hell out of there.

454
00:41:00,107 --> 00:41:02,200
Move it! Come on, move!

455
00:41:04,445 --> 00:41:08,176
Looks like I caught a terrorist.
What's in the bag?

456
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:12,409
- Nothing.
- Yeah? Let's look at that nothing.

457
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:17,489
- I wouldn't do this if I were you.
- But you aren't me, are you?

458
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:34,739
- We gotta find him before he eats.
- He already ate.

459
00:41:34,942 --> 00:41:38,776
There are more of them.
We gotta shut the building down.

460
00:41:39,113 --> 00:41:40,512
We?

461
00:41:40,714 --> 00:41:42,739
We? We!

462
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:46,977
No, "we" gotta get the cops
and put you in a rubber room.

463
00:41:47,188 --> 00:41:49,782
I'm not crazy. They're dangerous.

464
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:52,618
I've dealt with them.
They wreck things.

465
00:41:52,826 --> 00:41:54,691
Ooh! They wreck things!

466
00:41:54,895 --> 00:42:00,492
- Remember this town, Kingston Falls?
- I remember the Kingston Trio.

467
00:42:03,971 --> 00:42:08,635
Let's go, kids. We're home, let's go.
This way. Over here.

468
00:42:12,179 --> 00:42:15,546
- How did you get me out?
- With next month's rent.

469
00:42:15,749 --> 00:42:18,081
- What time is it?
- Around 6:30.

470
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:21,152
They probably made
their cocoons by now.

471
00:42:21,355 --> 00:42:25,416
- How long do they take to hatch?
- Not long enough. Come on.

472
00:43:00,127 --> 00:43:02,288
Echo!

473
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:44,269
Gizmo, ca-ca!

474
00:43:46,807 --> 00:43:52,973
<i>Clamp Centre is experiencing</i>
<i>illumination system difficulties.</i>

475
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,375
<i>Please try not to notice.</i>

476
00:43:55,582 --> 00:43:58,642
The building is completely
screwed up today.

477
00:43:58,852 --> 00:44:00,410
I know, Fred.

478
00:44:00,621 --> 00:44:03,818
Sure. You're young.

479
00:44:04,024 --> 00:44:06,083
You know everything.

480
00:44:10,364 --> 00:44:13,492
Bright light.
We'll need some of these.

481
00:44:15,803 --> 00:44:17,828
Con Ed.

482
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,403
Gizmo, zap, zap!

483
00:44:28,315 --> 00:44:30,476
I have to go to systems control.

484
00:44:30,684 --> 00:44:33,244
- Kate, you're up.
- Good morning, Billy.

485
00:44:33,454 --> 00:44:34,546
Oh, hi.

486
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:38,589
Last night was wonderful.
We have to do it again.

487
00:44:38,892 --> 00:44:40,951
Marla, this is Kate.

488
00:44:41,161 --> 00:44:44,358
My goodness, I have to go right away.
Hello.

489
00:44:44,565 --> 00:44:47,295
- Hi.
- Cute hat.

490
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:52,095
Honey, that's my boss.
That's the woman I work with.

491
00:44:52,306 --> 00:44:56,299
If we get through today alive,
you're in big trouble.

492
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:59,001
But you don't think that...

493
00:45:00,147 --> 00:45:01,079
Great.

494
00:45:07,388 --> 00:45:09,822
- Peltzer...!
- I need to speak with you.

495
00:45:10,023 --> 00:45:13,083
You got arrested but you've come back.
Miss us?

496
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:16,057
- You gotta evacuate the building.
- Why?

497
00:45:16,263 --> 00:45:20,597
There are creatures in it.
They start out small and furry.

498
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:24,293
If they eat after midnight,
they form cocoons...

499
00:45:24,505 --> 00:45:28,407
- You're having a psychotic episode.
- You gotta listen.

500
00:45:28,609 --> 00:45:32,101
This is good.
They're furry, then they have cocoons.

501
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:34,007
They eat, then cocoon.

502
00:45:34,214 --> 00:45:38,014
Sure. You're going into a cocoon,
you wanna eat first.

503
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:42,953
Now we're in the nerve center
of Clamp Cable Network.

504
00:45:44,124 --> 00:45:47,924
- Mr. Katsuji, please get back in line.
- Please.

505
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:55,965
If we're very quiet, we can watch a
program being videotaped.

506
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,967
Right this way.

507
00:46:04,611 --> 00:46:08,809
This week we have our special
<i>Salute to Luncheon Meats.</i>

508
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:14,648
Many of you have written, asking
how to zing up party appetizers.

509
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:20,225
I'm very excited about this recipe.
It's so piquant with sherry.

510
00:46:20,427 --> 00:46:23,487
Some people use a dash.

511
00:46:25,899 --> 00:46:27,560
I use a lot.

512
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:32,301
So let's just plunge into our
hors d'oeuvres, shall we?

513
00:46:32,506 --> 00:46:36,670
You know, these bologna
and bean dip roll-ups...

514
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:42,008
...are so easy
when friends drop over.

515
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:46,949
Okay, wait. What if one of them eats
something at 11:00...

516
00:46:47,154 --> 00:46:51,853
...but something sticks in his teeth?
- A caraway or a sesame seed.

517
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:56,155
And after 12, it comes out.
He didn't eat it after midnight.

518
00:46:56,363 --> 00:46:58,957
- I didn't make the rules.
- Rules?

519
00:46:59,132 --> 00:47:03,068
What if they're in an airplane
and they cross a time zone?

520
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,704
It's always midnight somewhere.

521
00:47:31,365 --> 00:47:34,994
- Peltzer, is this...?
- Yes, sir.

522
00:47:47,581 --> 00:47:51,073
- Take this, in case it comes back.
- Right.

523
00:47:56,023 --> 00:47:59,789
Before microwaves,
this used to take forever.

524
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,687
But now, we can make the same...

525
00:48:03,897 --> 00:48:08,163
...tuna-noodle-cheese-product
chowder surprise...

526
00:48:08,435 --> 00:48:10,801
...in just a few minutes.

527
00:48:11,004 --> 00:48:14,098
Now, let's just move down...

528
00:48:15,342 --> 00:48:16,400
What's that?

529
00:48:17,177 --> 00:48:18,371
What is that?

530
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,375
Must be a brownout.

531
00:48:21,582 --> 00:48:23,880
We'll do an edit. Pick it up there.

532
00:48:24,084 --> 00:48:27,110
Oh, well. The show must go on.

533
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:31,451
So let's ladle up
some of our chowder-noodle...

534
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:03,786
Run for your lives! Monster!

535
00:49:11,498 --> 00:49:14,331
Microwave!

536
00:49:19,573 --> 00:49:22,303
You see what these monsters are doing?

537
00:49:22,643 --> 00:49:26,511
They're throwing metal utensils into
the microwave!

538
00:49:46,466 --> 00:49:48,093
Stay here and die!

539
00:50:24,037 --> 00:50:27,939
Wait. Wait! What is it? Wait!

540
00:50:29,309 --> 00:50:31,539
- Mr. Katsuji!
- I need a Polaroid.

541
00:50:31,745 --> 00:50:33,804
It's not part of the program!

542
00:50:41,421 --> 00:50:44,254
Something weird
is going on in Studio D.

543
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,426
Punch it up on the stack.

544
00:51:04,511 --> 00:51:07,275
I show brownouts
in five more locations.

545
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:11,008
Climate control malfunction,
floors 15 and 16.

546
00:51:11,218 --> 00:51:12,344
What the hell?

547
00:51:12,552 --> 00:51:16,579
The pest infestation monitor
is reading critical.

548
00:51:21,194 --> 00:51:23,958
What is that?
That could be rats, right?

549
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:26,359
No, sir. I'm afraid it's not.

550
00:51:26,566 --> 00:51:31,003
Whatever they are, they've gotta
respect the chain of command.

551
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:44,044
Gizmo, Gizmo, Gizmo, Gizmo!

552
00:51:44,618 --> 00:51:47,644
Light bright! Light bright!

553
00:51:59,466 --> 00:52:02,867
<i>- Please state your desired floor.</i>
- Thirty-eight.

554
00:52:03,069 --> 00:52:05,162
Thirty-eight.

555
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:08,136
Thirty-eight! Thirty-eight...

556
00:52:08,408 --> 00:52:10,876
Going up!

557
00:52:18,785 --> 00:52:20,946
Elevator, stop.

558
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:25,615
Sound alarm.

559
00:52:55,622 --> 00:52:58,716
Betty, did you finish
shredding my mail?

560
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:02,224
<i>- I'm just finishing, Mr. Clamp.</i>
- Good.

561
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,023
Let's...

562
00:53:06,867 --> 00:53:08,528
Let's do some memos.

563
00:53:11,872 --> 00:53:16,969
<i>First, one to Frager,</i>
<i>in public relations.</i>

564
00:53:17,177 --> 00:53:20,806
<i>Have the people in Chinatown</i>
<i>give a street festival.</i>

565
00:53:21,014 --> 00:53:26,850
A spontaneous flood of appreciation
for all I've done for the community.

566
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:32,487
<i>We could have those dragons. Those</i>
<i>big dragons with the guys inside.</i>

567
00:53:32,692 --> 00:53:36,651
<i>- And maybe we could have a parade.</i>
- Yum-yum!

568
00:53:36,863 --> 00:53:40,799
<i>Call that big department store.</i>
<i>They got lots of floats.</i>

569
00:53:41,001 --> 00:53:43,902
<i>They keep them in a warehouse</i>
<i>in New Jersey.</i>

570
00:53:44,838 --> 00:53:46,999
I think I own that.

571
00:53:53,713 --> 00:53:58,616
A, B, C, D, J, K...

572
00:54:04,124 --> 00:54:05,887
Coffee?

573
00:55:02,315 --> 00:55:05,910
Let go of my tie!

574
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:17,663
- Bill!
- Mr. Clamp, sir, are you okay?

575
00:55:17,864 --> 00:55:21,732
Yeah, I think so. I hate
using these machines myself.

576
00:55:21,935 --> 00:55:26,065
- Sir, we have a problem...
- We have a situation... Oh, my God.

577
00:55:26,272 --> 00:55:29,708
We have to evacuate the building
and close it down.

578
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:32,571
- That's ridiculous.
- Before sundown.

579
00:55:32,779 --> 00:55:37,079
- What happens at sundown?
- They hate sunlight. It kills them.

580
00:55:37,283 --> 00:55:41,014
When it gets dark,
they'll try to leave the building...

581
00:55:41,221 --> 00:55:44,554
Calm down. He should be in custody.
He's dangerous.

582
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:49,752
This thing, that's dangerous.
This guy's from the art department.

583
00:55:49,963 --> 00:55:52,864
Ask him how he knows
about these things.

584
00:55:53,066 --> 00:55:55,193
How do you know about them?

585
00:55:55,402 --> 00:56:00,704
- This animal was in the genetics lab...
- I said it could be a problem tenant.

586
00:56:00,907 --> 00:56:05,207
We could have had three shrinks
and a plastic surgeon. Here.

587
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:22,851
Make a wish!

588
00:56:30,203 --> 00:56:32,262
Ah, hair!

589
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:45,774
Going down!

590
00:56:56,429 --> 00:56:58,863
Second floor, lingerie.

591
00:57:07,107 --> 00:57:13,239
<i>The elevator doors have opened.</i>
<i>Please leave, and watch your step.</i>

592
00:57:13,913 --> 00:57:17,314
We'll...
We'll get the next one.

593
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:20,251
- You don't think it had rabies?
- No.

594
00:57:20,453 --> 00:57:25,220
- We must stop them from getting wet.
- No, we have to put a lid on it.

595
00:57:25,425 --> 00:57:28,861
No cops, no media.
We'll handle this ourselves.

596
00:57:29,062 --> 00:57:34,227
- You go down to systems control.
- But there might be physical danger.

597
00:57:34,434 --> 00:57:36,766
You're supposed to handle bugs.

598
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:41,532
Well, I'd call these some goddamn
major bugs, wouldn't you? Huh?

599
00:57:41,741 --> 00:57:46,178
Okay. But I don't think
I should try it without an expert.

600
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:48,244
Let's go, Peltzer.

601
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:54,516
Three, two, one. Cue Leonard.

602
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:58,657
<i>Hi. I'm Leonard Maltin,</i>
<i>and this is</i> The Movie Police.

603
00:57:59,259 --> 00:58:00,954
First, our video watch.

604
00:58:01,161 --> 00:58:05,757
Just rereleased on video is <i>Gremlins,</i>
though I can't imagine why.

605
00:58:05,965 --> 00:58:11,232
I know some people found it fun, but
I'd rather have root canal work done.

606
00:58:11,437 --> 00:58:16,136
What's fun about a movie full of ugly,
mean-spirited monsters...

607
00:58:16,342 --> 00:58:18,936
...who attack innocent people?

608
00:58:19,145 --> 00:58:23,912
Are we so desperate for entertainment
that this trash passes for fun?

609
00:58:24,117 --> 00:58:25,550
Wait a minute!

610
00:58:38,998 --> 00:58:44,994
Look at this. I've been working on
making tomatoes tougher for shipping.

611
00:58:45,205 --> 00:58:48,766
- That's terrific!
- Topnotch! How do they taste?

612
00:58:48,975 --> 00:58:54,413
That's the best part. We've already
had calls from two airline chefs.

613
00:58:58,685 --> 00:59:01,984
Oh, my gosh!

614
00:59:02,155 --> 00:59:05,886
- Did somebody leave something out?
- Not I.

615
00:59:06,092 --> 00:59:09,027
It's eating my vegetable medley.

616
00:59:15,401 --> 00:59:18,370
- What's that noise?
- I think they're laughing.

617
00:59:18,705 --> 00:59:21,367
- Reptiles don't laugh!
- They're not reptiles.

618
00:59:21,574 --> 00:59:24,065
- Then what are they?
- A virus?

619
00:59:29,716 --> 00:59:32,276
What on earth is going on?

620
00:59:34,187 --> 00:59:38,021
I leave you alone, what do I find
when I get back? Chaos!

621
00:59:41,227 --> 00:59:44,958
Is that the brain hormone
that creature's drinking?

622
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:48,531
Good boy. Nice boy.

623
00:59:48,735 --> 00:59:53,570
There's a good creature.
Now, let's talk this over.

624
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:59,138
I can get you diseases.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

625
01:00:06,252 --> 01:00:08,379
Perhaps not.

626
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:37,881
I wanna talk...

627
01:00:38,084 --> 01:00:40,575
...about what's going on in here.

628
01:00:40,787 --> 01:00:45,087
There are some fascinating
ramifications for the future.

629
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:49,660
When you introduce genetic
material to our life form...

630
01:00:49,862 --> 01:00:52,660
...which is possessed of a sort of...

631
01:00:52,865 --> 01:00:55,231
...I hesitate to say "atavism"...

632
01:00:55,435 --> 01:00:58,302
...but let us say
an aggressive nature.

633
01:00:58,504 --> 01:01:03,840
That fellow over there is a common bat
of the order of Chiroptera.

634
01:01:04,043 --> 01:01:08,070
The only mammals, I might add,
capable of true flight.

635
01:01:27,133 --> 01:01:29,499
Ah, genetic sunblock!

636
01:01:30,703 --> 01:01:31,965
Yes.

637
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:41,311
Might I have a word with you?
My friend, you have potential.

638
01:01:41,514 --> 01:01:44,950
I wanna help you be all
that you can be. May I?

639
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:50,551
As you're aware, sunlight poses
a problem for our ethnic group.

640
01:01:50,757 --> 01:01:52,748
We don't tan or burn.

641
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:57,396
We become a rather unappetizing
photochemical leftover.

642
01:01:57,597 --> 01:02:02,899
Thus this formula, designed for those
of the nocturnal persuasion...

643
01:02:03,102 --> 01:02:05,593
...to make light no problem at all.

644
01:02:05,838 --> 01:02:09,365
That'll be useful
where you'll be going.

645
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:13,406
Where he'll be going?

646
01:02:13,613 --> 01:02:18,243
All they have to do is eat children,
there'd be appalling publicity.

647
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:24,449
There it is. The Apple.
The city so nice they named it twice.

648
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:27,956
Check it out one time, won't you?

649
01:02:37,069 --> 01:02:38,866
Catch it! Don't let it go!

650
01:02:39,071 --> 01:02:40,936
- Down!
- Down!

651
01:03:00,893 --> 01:03:02,758
<i>Here in Manhattan...</i>

652
01:03:02,962 --> 01:03:07,592

I'd say it's a full-scale panic.

656
01:03:30,423 --> 01:03:34,883
Are you having a run on the banks yet?
It's brutal here.

- Beautiful?

670
01:04:52,939 --> 01:04:55,635
It's like something
out of the Dark Ages.

671
01:04:55,841 --> 01:04:58,366
Hey, Quasimodo, you home?

Hey...

673
01:05:09,522 --> 01:05:12,355

674
01:05:14,126 --> 01:05:15,684
Get off!

675
01:05:38,117 --> 01:05:42,053
It's just a flesh wound, Murray!

- Hurry up, Lewis!
- I'm coming, Martin!

677
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,993
The horror. The horror. The breakage!

678
01:06:57,196 --> 01:06:59,027
Sir, what happened?

679
01:06:59,231 --> 01:07:02,496
They fought back,
that's what happened.

680
01:07:02,702 --> 01:07:04,465
Things.

681
01:07:04,670 --> 01:07:06,501
Stuff.

682
01:07:06,706 --> 01:07:09,834
I swear, I'll never hurt
anything again.

683

Some things man isn't meant to splice.

684
01:07:12,912 --> 01:07:15,142
- A problem tenant.
- Calm down.

685
01:07:15,347 --> 01:07:18,316
- We won't renew your lease.
- Where are they?

686
01:07:18,517 --> 01:07:21,418
Don't patronize me! I saw them.

687
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:25,647
- But where?
- In my laboratory, the Splice of Life.

688
01:07:25,858 --> 01:07:29,157
Stupid name. But it wasn't my idea.

689

Sir, I can't believe this.
This is worse than the first one.

694
01:08:18,744 --> 01:08:22,271
We just show these movies,
we don't make them.

695
01:08:22,481 --> 01:08:23,607
But...

696
01:08:23,816 --> 01:08:27,081
I quit. Call the union,
the National Guard.

697
01:08:27,286 --> 01:08:30,153
Those things took over the projector.

698

All they wanna see
is <i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.</i>

699
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:36,358
Enough!

700

I'll take care of this.

701
01:08:46,105 --> 01:08:49,905
Mr. Hulk, we have Gremlins
in the projection booth.

702
01:08:50,109 --> 01:08:54,512
- Could you help us?
- Gremlins? In this theater? Now?

703
01:08:55,648 --> 01:09:00,085
Okay, guys, listen up.
People paid money to see this movie.

704
01:09:00,286 --> 01:09:04,120
When they go out,
they want cold sodas, popcorn...

705
01:09:04,323 --> 01:09:07,019
...and no monsters
in the projection booth.

706
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:09,194
Do I have to come up there?

707
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:12,796
Can the Gremsters stand up
to the Hulkster?

708
01:09:12,998 --> 01:09:17,901
If I were you, I'd run the rest
of <i>Gremlins 2</i> right now!

I was never crazy. I'm fine.

760
01:15:25,003 --> 01:15:26,265
Let me in there!

761
01:15:53,699 --> 01:15:57,533
Bill, any progress?
Just tell me there's progress.

762
01:15:57,736 --> 01:16:00,500
Things are really bad out there.

763
01:16:00,839 --> 01:16:04,536
Bad?! Only one of my channels
is still on the air.

764
01:16:04,743 --> 01:16:07,735
There are human beings
in the building.

765
01:16:07,946 --> 01:16:11,575
Do you know what kind of lawsuits
we're looking at?

766
01:16:11,783 --> 01:16:13,410
Yes, I know, but...

767
01:16:22,294 --> 01:16:24,455
<i>All of our operators are busy.</i>

768
01:16:24,663 --> 01:16:28,531
<i>Your call will be handled</i>
<i>in the order received.</i>

769
01:16:28,734 --> 01:16:31,100
- What is that?
- One of those things.

770
01:16:31,303 --> 01:16:34,932
- They come in electric too?
- They do now.

771
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:37,836
He's in the phone system on hold.

772
01:16:45,984 --> 01:16:51,547
I thought this would never run.
Maybe it will, now.

773
01:16:56,795 --> 01:17:02,233
<i>Because of the end of civilization,</i>
<i>CCN now leaves the air.</i>

774
01:17:02,434 --> 01:17:06,131
<i>We hope you have enjoyed</i>
<i>our programming.</i>

775
01:17:06,338 --> 01:17:11,275
<i>But more importantly,</i>
<i>we hope you have enjoyed life.</i>

776
01:17:11,476 --> 01:17:16,277
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes, sir. It's very uplifting.

777
01:17:16,481 --> 01:17:22,283
Is there any way to turn the clocks
ahead in the building three hours?

778
01:17:22,487 --> 01:17:25,388
There's nothing we can't do. Why?

779
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:27,715
Sunlight kills them.

780
01:17:27,926 --> 01:17:32,522
If we can fool them into thinking
the sun has gone down...

781
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:34,798
...they may go to the lobby.

782
01:17:34,966 --> 01:17:39,494
Right! The front doors are the only
way out of the building.

783
01:17:39,705 --> 01:17:43,971
- The sun sets at 7:32.
- Then we should move at 4:20.

784
01:17:44,176 --> 01:17:47,703
I like that!
We have information they don't have.

785
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:51,314
That's how you take somebody out.
Wait a minute.

786
01:17:51,516 --> 01:17:54,349
Won't they see the sun's still out?

787
01:17:54,553 --> 01:17:57,215
- You'll have to take care of that.
- Me?

788
01:17:57,422 --> 01:18:00,414
- Set it up from the outside.
- Good!

789
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:03,387
I finally get to use my secret exit.

790
01:18:03,595 --> 01:18:05,495
- You know, sir?
- Yes?

791
01:18:05,697 --> 01:18:08,860
If you pull this off,
you could save the city.

792
01:18:09,067 --> 01:18:13,333
Save the city? "Developer Saves City."
I like that!

793
01:18:28,653 --> 01:18:32,589
Is anyone still employed
in this charming facility?

794
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:35,191
I need light in my office. Now!

795
01:18:35,394 --> 01:18:40,730
<i>At Clamp Enterprises we want you</i>
<i>to achieve all you can.</i>

796
01:18:40,932 --> 01:18:43,924
Turn on the lights in my office.

797
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:47,572
You want me to work in the dark?

798
01:18:49,207 --> 01:18:51,107
This is new.

799
01:19:17,702 --> 01:19:20,227
Hey, that's Clamp! Let's go!

800
01:19:24,876 --> 01:19:28,312
- Has the building been evacuated?
- Is it on fire?

801
01:19:28,513 --> 01:19:31,914
That's a false alarm.
We've just got some problems.

802
01:19:32,117 --> 01:19:35,416
You got a guy in there
in a Dracula suit.

803
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:38,180
Are you trying to panic the city?

804
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:40,858
- So they are real?
- I didn't say that.

805
01:19:41,059 --> 01:19:44,153
- What are you saying?
- What I always say.

806
01:19:59,077 --> 01:20:00,066
Murray?

807
01:20:29,808 --> 01:20:31,002
Gizmo?

808
01:21:26,498 --> 01:21:28,796
<i>As you probably know...</i>

809
01:21:30,135 --> 01:21:34,299
<i>As you probably know,</i>
<i>an entire race of strange beings...</i>

810
01:21:34,506 --> 01:21:36,736
<i>... has invaded the building.</i>

811
01:21:36,942 --> 01:21:42,278
<i>And in an even more bizarre twist,</i>
<i>one of the creatures...</i>

812
01:21:43,181 --> 01:21:46,275
<i>"Creatures." Is that accurate?</i>

813
01:21:49,454 --> 01:21:53,288
- That one of these creatures
is able to talk...

814
01:21:53,491 --> 01:21:56,824
...and he's going to talk
with us right now.

815
01:21:57,028 --> 01:21:59,496
The main question people have is:

816
01:21:59,831 --> 01:22:02,459
Creature, what is it that you want?

817
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:04,862
Fred, what we want...

818
01:22:05,070 --> 01:22:09,404
...is what you and your viewers have:
Civilization.

819
01:22:09,741 --> 01:22:14,007
Yes, but what sort of civilization
are you speaking of?

820
01:22:14,212 --> 01:22:16,476
<i>The niceties. The fine points.</i>

821
01:22:16,681 --> 01:22:20,412
<i>Diplomacy, compassion, standards,</i>
<i>manners, tradition.</i>

822
01:22:20,585 --> 01:22:22,576
<i>That's what we reach toward.</i>

823
01:22:22,921 --> 01:22:26,220
We may stumble on the way,
but civilization, yes.

824
01:22:26,424 --> 01:22:29,188
The Geneva Convention, Susan Sontag.

825
01:22:29,394 --> 01:22:33,694
Everything you've worked hard
to accomplish, we aspire to.

826
01:22:33,898 --> 01:22:38,665
We wanna be civilized.
Take a look at this fellow here.

827
01:22:41,973 --> 01:22:44,840
Now, was that civilized? Clearly not.

828
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:47,739
Fun, but in no sense civilized.

829
01:22:47,946 --> 01:22:50,847
<i>None of us has been</i>
<i>in New York before.</i>

830
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:54,485
<i>We have to learn how to get</i>
<i>tickets for shows.</i>

831
01:22:54,686 --> 01:22:58,713
<i>There's street crime,</i>
<i>but we can watch that for free.</i>

832
01:22:58,923 --> 01:23:02,859
<i>We want the essentials.</i>
<i>Dinettes, bedroom groups...</i>

833
01:23:03,094 --> 01:23:06,222
<i>... credit even if we've</i>
<i>been turned down before.</i>

834
01:23:06,798 --> 01:23:10,666
Take it easy with that thing.
Be careful up there!

835
01:23:11,002 --> 01:23:12,936
What's that thing for?

836
01:23:13,138 --> 01:23:16,471
These things can only come out
when it's dark.

837
01:23:16,675 --> 01:23:20,634
We set the clocks ahead.
When they think it's sunset...

838
01:23:20,845 --> 01:23:25,714
...and see what a nice night it is,
they'll muster in the lobby.

839
01:23:25,917 --> 01:23:29,944
The sunlight'll pour through here
and fry them!

840
01:23:30,155 --> 01:23:31,144
Sure.

841
01:24:06,357 --> 01:24:09,383
- Is it safe?
- Help!

842
01:24:10,228 --> 01:24:12,025
Billy!

843
01:24:16,434 --> 01:24:18,527
I hate these little things!

844
01:24:25,143 --> 01:24:27,976
- You okay, Billy?
- Yeah. Get me out of here.

845
01:24:31,683 --> 01:24:35,585
- Billy?
- Could I get some help here, please?

846
01:24:35,787 --> 01:24:38,722
I'm trapped in adhesive
polymer material...

847
01:24:38,923 --> 01:24:41,153
...and I'm on deadline!

848
01:24:41,359 --> 01:24:44,385
Darling, it's you!
Thank God you're here.

849
01:24:44,596 --> 01:24:48,896
Well, I could help you,
or I could just leave you here.

850
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:53,332
Listen, about Billy. Nothing happened.

851
01:24:53,538 --> 01:24:57,736
I asked him out to dinner.
It was strictly business.

852
01:24:57,942 --> 01:25:01,969
Okay, it wasn't completely business,
I'll be honest.

853
01:25:02,213 --> 01:25:04,238
It'll be an openness thing.

854
01:25:04,449 --> 01:25:08,681
I had designs on him.
I didn't get to first base. Okay?

855
01:25:08,887 --> 01:25:15,122
- It'll do.
- What a wonderfully prepared woman.

856
01:26:56,961 --> 01:26:58,929
What happened to him?

857
01:27:00,531 --> 01:27:03,728
I don't know.
I guess they pushed him too far.

858
01:27:10,608 --> 01:27:13,509
- Lf they get out...
- We'll stop them, Billy.

859
01:27:13,678 --> 01:27:15,043
Don't give up now.

860
01:27:15,213 --> 01:27:17,147
Washington didn't.
Lincoln...

861
01:27:17,315 --> 01:27:18,680
- Please!
- What?

862
01:27:18,850 --> 01:27:20,408
Don't mention Lincoln.

863
01:27:20,585 --> 01:27:25,352
A terrible thing happened
to me once on Lincoln's birthday.

864
01:27:25,523 --> 01:27:28,117
I was 6 or 7.

865
01:27:28,326 --> 01:27:32,092
I had the day off from school.
Mama sent me to the park.

866
01:27:32,263 --> 01:27:38,259
She made me a peanut butter and jelly
sandwich. That's all I ever ate.

867
01:27:38,436 --> 01:27:41,496
A man with a beard and hat...
Just like Lincoln.

868
01:27:41,673 --> 01:27:44,904
Honey, we don't have
time for this now.

869
01:27:45,076 --> 01:27:48,637
I remember... Oh, God.
He said, "Hello, little girl."

870
01:27:58,556 --> 01:28:00,114
Is everybody here?

871
01:28:00,625 --> 01:28:02,058
All right, then!

872
01:28:36,461 --> 01:28:37,689
These guys aren't bad.

873
01:28:38,029 --> 01:28:40,930
Incredible as it seems,
ladies and gentlemen...

874
01:28:41,099 --> 01:28:46,196
...after their bizarre, bloodcurdling
rampage of destruction...

875
01:28:46,404 --> 01:28:51,865
...these strange creatures now appear
to be mounting what seems to be...

876
01:28:52,043 --> 01:28:54,204
...a musical number.

877
01:29:44,962 --> 01:29:46,759
They're near the doors.

878
01:29:46,931 --> 01:29:50,423
Don't worry. Soon Mr. Clamp
will drop the cloth...

879
01:29:50,601 --> 01:29:52,262
...and let in the sun.

880
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:56,240
Okay, are we ready to drop this thing?

881
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:08,150
Sunlight?

882
01:30:40,284 --> 01:30:42,809
Say cheese!

883
01:31:13,017 --> 01:31:18,717
They get in the rain, the city
will go under. Armageddon! WWIII!

884
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:22,223
- Billy, we've gotta do something.
- I know.

885
01:31:24,195 --> 01:31:28,131
There's a fire hose.
Aim it into the lobby.

886
01:31:28,332 --> 01:31:29,663
Are you crazy?

887
01:31:29,834 --> 01:31:31,461
Just do it, and fast!

888
01:31:31,636 --> 01:31:34,969
Put Gizmo in a box
so he doesn't get wet.

889
01:31:35,139 --> 01:31:36,299
Marla...

890
01:31:36,474 --> 01:31:38,339
- Smoke.
- Thanks.

891
01:31:52,657 --> 01:31:53,715
Loogie!

892
01:31:59,997 --> 01:32:01,555
Lobby!

893
01:32:02,567 --> 01:32:04,535
Don't mess with Futterman!

894
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:14,742
There's a call on hold in Mr. Clamp's
office. Can you transfer it here?

895
01:32:14,912 --> 01:32:16,402
Yeah, I think so.

896
01:32:19,250 --> 01:32:20,717
Ready!

897
01:32:20,885 --> 01:32:21,977
Turn it on!

898
01:32:49,714 --> 01:32:53,081
Billy, I hope you know
what the hell you're doing.

899
01:32:53,284 --> 01:32:55,844
I'm singing in the bathtub!

900
01:32:56,721 --> 01:32:59,918
Bypass the file server.

901
01:33:03,894 --> 01:33:06,158
- That's it!
- My God!

902
01:33:06,964 --> 01:33:08,659
Turn off the hose!

903
01:33:12,570 --> 01:33:13,559
Hit it!

904
01:34:04,922 --> 01:34:06,355
I'm melting!

905
01:34:08,426 --> 01:34:11,418
Oh, what a world, what a world!

906
01:34:16,667 --> 01:34:22,765
The creatures seem to be melting into
horrible little green and brown...

907
01:34:23,374 --> 01:34:26,104
...puddles. It's, it's like...

908
01:34:26,277 --> 01:34:31,579
Well, I can't say what it looks like,
on television, but it looks terrible.

909
01:34:53,304 --> 01:34:55,670
Let's go! Come on!

910
01:34:57,808 --> 01:35:04,077
It's stuck. Come on. Back up here.
Down there. Come on! Let's go!

911
01:35:04,382 --> 01:35:07,146
We'll take them by this door.
Come on!

912
01:35:07,318 --> 01:35:09,479
Charge!

913
01:35:22,433 --> 01:35:26,597
I didn't hurt myself. Maybe we can
use this stuff for landfill.

914
01:35:26,804 --> 01:35:31,298
- We're here with Daniel R. Clamp.
- Hey! Hey! Wait a minute, pal!

915
01:35:31,475 --> 01:35:34,308
Who told you to go on my network?

916
01:35:34,478 --> 01:35:38,812
Nobody, sir.
It just seemed like news, so...

917
01:35:38,983 --> 01:35:45,388
Right, right. I'm making you
an anchor. Six o'clock, weeknights.

918
01:35:45,556 --> 01:35:49,856
Go to Barneys and get new clothes.
Give this man a credit card.

919
01:35:50,027 --> 01:35:53,485
This is Old World.
Think sweaters. Think avuncular.

920
01:35:53,664 --> 01:35:55,495
Right. Avuncular!

921
01:35:55,666 --> 01:35:58,726
- And my cameraman?
- Off caffeine, he's okay.

922
01:35:58,903 --> 01:36:01,463
- I'm a hit!
- We're a hit.

923
01:36:01,639 --> 01:36:06,576
What does a menswear makeover cost
today? Join us as we investigate...

924
01:36:06,744 --> 01:36:08,871
And get some sun this weekend!

925
01:36:09,046 --> 01:36:11,537
Hey, Bill! Oh, boy!

926
01:36:14,051 --> 01:36:17,145
- What's happening?
- It moved, sir.

927
01:36:17,321 --> 01:36:22,384
All right. Carry on.
Careful, that stuff's slippery.

928
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:23,993
So you bailed us out.

929
01:36:24,161 --> 01:36:28,461
It wasn't just me. We all chipped in.
Mr. Futterman and Marla.

930
01:36:28,632 --> 01:36:29,860
Marla?

931
01:36:30,868 --> 01:36:31,960
Yes, sir?

932
01:36:32,136 --> 01:36:34,570
You work for me, don't you?

933
01:36:37,775 --> 01:36:39,242
Yes, sir.

934
01:36:39,910 --> 01:36:41,571
Very, very hard.

935
01:36:50,821 --> 01:36:52,379
What happened?

936
01:36:52,756 --> 01:36:55,316
They tried it again,
but we were ready.

937
01:36:55,493 --> 01:36:59,361
- Let's go. Smells like burnt meatloaf.
- It's Daniel Clamp!

938
01:36:59,530 --> 01:37:03,227
He's here!
Mr. Clamp, can we have a statement?

939
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:04,697
Please, please!

940
01:37:05,102 --> 01:37:10,563
My new head of public relations here
will handle all questions.

941
01:37:11,141 --> 01:37:12,130
Why, Daniel!

942
01:37:12,309 --> 01:37:16,245
- What happened?
- Where's the camera? It was horrible.

943
01:37:16,413 --> 01:37:19,143
We had to stop work altogether.

944
01:37:19,316 --> 01:37:21,784
- Sorry about the building.
- I'm not.

945
01:37:21,952 --> 01:37:25,183
- You're not?
- No, we're insured for the damages.

946
01:37:25,356 --> 01:37:29,656
Maybe it wasn't a place
for people anyway.

947
01:37:29,827 --> 01:37:35,163
It was a place for things. You make
a place for things. Things come.

948
01:37:35,366 --> 01:37:38,028
You kept the city safe, sir.

949
01:37:38,202 --> 01:37:42,229
That's right. That's a good point.
The sacrifice.

950
01:37:42,406 --> 01:37:45,398
Could be in my next book!
I should take notes.

951
01:37:45,576 --> 01:37:49,979
- Who's got a pencil and paper?
- Here you go.

952
01:37:53,450 --> 01:37:55,441
- What's this?
- Kingston Falls.

953
01:37:55,653 --> 01:37:58,247
- I've looked for this!
- To buy?

954
01:37:58,422 --> 01:38:03,257
No, to build for my next project
in Jersey! This is terrific!

955
01:38:03,427 --> 01:38:06,954
People want the traditional
community thing now.

956
01:38:07,131 --> 01:38:10,157
Quiet little towns, back to the earth.

957
01:38:10,334 --> 01:38:11,926
Is this your concept?

958
01:38:12,102 --> 01:38:17,096
- It's our hometown.
- That's better. I love that! It's...

959
01:38:17,274 --> 01:38:20,004
Wait. It's...

960
01:38:20,177 --> 01:38:25,479
"Clamp Corners. Where life
slows down to a crawl."

961
01:38:25,649 --> 01:38:28,311
- What do you think?
- It's terrific.

962
01:38:28,686 --> 01:38:32,349
This is what people want,
not talking elevators.

963
01:38:32,523 --> 01:38:36,186
You sell me this design,
and we'll build the biggest...

964
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:39,295
...most sensational
quiet little town ever.

965
01:38:39,463 --> 01:38:43,763
- But for him to do an entire town...
- We can come to a deal.

966
01:38:43,934 --> 01:38:49,998
- Are you Mrs. Peltzer?
- Yes! Well, I'm gonna be.

967
01:38:50,174 --> 01:38:53,405
- What's that?
- This is Gizmo.

968
01:38:53,711 --> 01:38:55,906
- He's a Mogwai.
- Mogwai.

969
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:59,538
- I look at him, you know what I see?
- What, sir?

970
01:38:59,717 --> 01:39:02,948
Dolls with suction cups
staring out car windows.

971
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:07,318
A Macy's parade float. Have you
thought about merchandising?

972
01:39:07,491 --> 01:39:09,083
- Me? No.
- Yeah!

973
01:39:09,259 --> 01:39:13,025
There's something there.
Lose the headband, though.

974
01:39:13,230 --> 01:39:15,198
He likes the headband.

975
01:39:15,366 --> 01:39:17,994
It's flexible. Excuse me.

976
01:39:18,202 --> 01:39:21,296
Most buildings wouldn't stand up
to this...

977
01:39:23,907 --> 01:39:25,135
Go home now.

978
01:39:31,582 --> 01:39:34,380
<i>No visit to New York</i>
<i>is complete without...</i>

979
01:39:34,551 --> 01:39:40,353
<i>...touring the world's most...</i>
- Put a glaze of cheese on top.

980
01:39:40,557 --> 01:39:43,082
- Your favorite.
- Yeah, sure.

981
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:45,057
Showtime! MTV.

982
01:39:45,229 --> 01:39:47,493
- Are you coming?
- In a minute.

983
01:39:47,998 --> 01:39:49,989
- HBO.
- What did he say?

984
01:39:50,167 --> 01:39:51,498
He wants cable.

985
01:39:51,669 --> 01:39:53,830
- Nick at Nite?
- No.

986
01:39:56,840 --> 01:39:58,398
- Have a cigarette?
- No.

987
01:39:58,575 --> 01:39:59,564
I'll quit.

988
01:39:59,743 --> 01:40:02,268
- From the building.
- In the building?

989
01:40:02,446 --> 01:40:08,248
Hello? Forster, what are you...?
Okay, we'll get you out. What floor?

990
01:40:08,419 --> 01:40:12,355
Way up there! Lt'll take a while.
The elevators are out.

991
01:40:12,523 --> 01:40:14,354
So are the automatic doors.

992
01:40:14,525 --> 01:40:19,189
I don't know, not long. We'll do what
we can. Keep your pants on.

993
01:40:19,630 --> 01:40:24,397
<i>- You've been working too hard.</i>
- Maybe I have, Mr. Clamp.

994
01:40:24,568 --> 01:40:28,129
<i>- Take a day off. Half a day.</i>
- That's generous, sir.

995
01:40:28,305 --> 01:40:32,765
A half-day off once the building
is operational. Thank you, sir.

996
01:43:21,011 --> 01:43:23,343
Long, isn't it?

997
01:44:19,202 --> 01:44:21,602
Patently ridiculous!

998
01:44:54,671 --> 01:44:59,438
Still lurking about?
Don't you people have homes?

999
01:45:48,759 --> 01:45:49,919
That's...

1000
01:45:50,093 --> 01:45:51,219
Oh, no, you don't!

1001
01:45:51,428 --> 01:45:55,694
Sorry, 60 years of hogging
the end title is enough!

1002
01:45:55,866 --> 01:45:58,460
So that's all, folks!

1003
01:46:02,339 --> 01:46:04,239
Fade out...!
