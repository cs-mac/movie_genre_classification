1
00:01:15,372 --> 00:01:17,387
- Mom?
- I am here.

2
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:31,964
Mom.

3
00:01:37,668 --> 00:01:40,816
- You forgot that.
- How could I forget this.

4
00:01:41,529 --> 00:01:43,785
Are you sure
this is the right thing?

5
00:01:43,786 --> 00:01:46,587
It feels like it'd be better
if we thought about it.

6
00:01:48,113 --> 00:01:52,176
Yeah, I do.
We don't have any other option, Clara.

7
00:01:53,476 --> 00:01:55,429
We are going to be fine.

8
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:57,930
Okay.

9
00:02:06,112 --> 00:02:10,461
If I get off early I can pick you up. Oh,
it really don't matter, I will take a bus.

10
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:15,513
I will be off early, I got a couple
of things to do for Jenny's party.

11
00:02:17,693 --> 00:02:19,229
Don't worry.

12
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,667
- Have a good day.
- You too, Mom.

13
00:02:42,286 --> 00:02:45,612
- How you doing?
- I don't know.

14
00:02:47,557 --> 00:02:49,410
How we're paying for all of this?

15
00:02:52,736 --> 00:02:55,939
- We put up the house.
- I knew it.

16
00:02:58,153 --> 00:03:00,087
It's because of you I am still alive..

17
00:03:03,646 --> 00:03:08,676
- We decided it together.
- What did you all decide together?

18
00:03:09,725 --> 00:03:14,283
To live on the street.. for 18 years.

19
00:03:15,966 --> 00:03:19,453
Your mother and I have been
paying on that house..

20
00:03:20,254 --> 00:03:22,411
just to fuck it all up.

21
00:03:22,412 --> 00:03:24,636
Next year I will be a
licensed electrician.

22
00:03:26,071 --> 00:03:27,987
So, no more illegal odd jobs.

23
00:03:29,388 --> 00:03:30,889
Going to be fine.

24
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,271
I never wanted to be a burden.

25
00:03:36,946 --> 00:03:39,131
Don't say that, Dad.

26
00:04:37,252 --> 00:04:40,655
I am leaving, babe.
So you got what you have been waiting for?

27
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:44,461
- Yeah, I got it.
- Would it be right?

28
00:04:45,296 --> 00:04:48,981
- That's not your concern.
- You can go to hell.

29
00:04:49,212 --> 00:04:51,406
That's exactly where I am going.

30
00:04:51,607 --> 00:04:53,021
But if I make it back,

31
00:04:53,022 --> 00:04:56,723
I going to make so much money,
you going to love me again.

32
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:15,939
Your brother would feel better
if family members visited more often.

33
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,849
A year is a long time
for someone in his condition.

34
00:06:19,998 --> 00:06:25,510
I am the only family Ronald has.
I try to get down here as often as I can.

35
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:29,510
Overall, his condition is still..
borderline, Mr. Hodges.

36
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:33,164
To skip his medications even for a day
could be serious.

37
00:06:33,907 --> 00:06:35,507
Yes, ma'am.

38
00:06:39,211 --> 00:06:42,649
Sign here and here,
and Ronald is released.

39
00:06:51,928 --> 00:06:55,156
Your brother is here, came to get you.
You have to go.

40
00:07:09,607 --> 00:07:12,045
- They take care of you in there?
- Yeah.

41
00:07:13,874 --> 00:07:16,109
- Good.
- It's a new car?

42
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:18,304
Yeah, do you like it?

43
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,573
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

44
00:07:38,807 --> 00:07:42,467
When I turned five years old,
I got a little kitten.

45
00:07:42,468 --> 00:07:45,545
And it was so cute that I took
them to bed with me every night.

46
00:07:46,308 --> 00:07:50,252
I want a little lamb, and I will take
it to bed with me every night too.

47
00:07:50,253 --> 00:07:53,431
- People don't keep sheep inside, silly.
- I will.

48
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:55,734
Didn't you hear?
We don't keep sheep inside..

49
00:07:55,735 --> 00:07:57,522
and we don't take them to bed with us.

50
00:07:57,523 --> 00:08:01,086
My little lamb has to be all white
with black ears.

51
00:08:01,087 --> 00:08:02,141
Why black ears?

52
00:08:02,542 --> 00:08:05,241
That way I won't get them mixed up
with the other sheep.

53
00:08:05,242 --> 00:08:08,837
- I will be able to recognize him.
- Very clever.

54
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,530
Thanks, Mom.

55
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,919
What is going on, man?

56
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:29,747
Kico Tevero..

57
00:09:42,851 --> 00:09:45,005
Hey, wait a minute. What the hell
you doing? Goddamn it.

58
00:09:45,006 --> 00:09:46,554
What the fuck you doing?

59
00:09:49,716 --> 00:09:51,093
Goddamn it.

60
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,304
Let me the fuck out of here.

61
00:09:53,946 --> 00:09:57,874
Oh, shit.
Goddamn.

62
00:10:00,047 --> 00:10:02,634
Get me the fuck out of here.

63
00:10:06,035 --> 00:10:07,534
A lot of people would want that.

64
00:10:07,535 --> 00:10:08,518
I am sorry.

65
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:09,514
Thank you.

66
00:10:09,515 --> 00:10:12,415
That was his job, I mean
there's nothing I can do for you.

67
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,942
Maybe in a few days.

68
00:10:16,963 --> 00:10:22,160
Hi, can I get you anything, coffee maybe?
I am good. No.

69
00:10:22,361 --> 00:10:23,548
No, babe.

70
00:10:30,248 --> 00:10:32,422
So what's this job about, man?
Dope?

71
00:10:33,323 --> 00:10:34,512
No. Nothing like that.

72
00:10:35,713 --> 00:10:38,917
- You need somebody taking care of?
- No.

73
00:10:39,823 --> 00:10:41,649
I am just asking for a good word.

74
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,937
- What? You want to go in my place?
- Listen, I am broke.

75
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:48,008
I am on the street.

76
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:50,914
Hey, I haven't forgotten what you did
for me when I was away.

77
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:54,067
If this thing works out.
I will set you up. I promise.

78
00:10:54,932 --> 00:10:58,266
- How long exactly will it take?
- One day.

79
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:03,384
Jesus. You make all that cash in one day?
If I make it.

80
00:11:04,382 --> 00:11:08,569
- But you made it the last time, right?
- That was last time.

81
00:11:10,991 --> 00:11:15,006
As long as my luck doesn't run out,
you can count on me.

82
00:12:22,748 --> 00:12:24,063
Hey..

83
00:12:37,772 --> 00:12:41,625
Vincent, do you still live at
135, Kissam Avenue, Talbot Ohio?

84
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,125
Yeah.

85
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,881
You have a phone number I can reach you
at if I have any further questions?

86
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:53,180
Sure, uh.. 216-555-0145.

87
00:12:54,471 --> 00:12:57,419
Okay Vincent, I think that about does it.
Thank you.

88
00:14:55,608 --> 00:14:58,626
Can you recall anything else he could
have told you about this affair?

89
00:14:58,627 --> 00:15:02,481
No. I already told you.
He never spoke about it.

90
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:06,141
- Even when he was high?
- No.

91
00:15:06,142 --> 00:15:10,141
Did anyone else come into the house,
aside from the paramedics and the police?

92
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:14,757
There was an electrician.
He was the one that called 911.

93
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:18,123
Thank you, Mrs. Harrison.

94
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,528
Thank you.

95
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,217
Thank you.

96
00:16:05,704 --> 00:16:09,502
- You sleep okay?
- Yeah, I feel much better now.

97
00:16:10,328 --> 00:16:13,195
- Did you take your medication?
- No.

98
00:16:14,504 --> 00:16:15,885
Look here..

99
00:16:16,551 --> 00:16:18,972
you know the doctor says
that you're not supposed to skip a dose.

100
00:16:18,973 --> 00:16:20,092
Fuck her.

101
00:16:20,093 --> 00:16:22,764
I feel much better without it anyway.

102
00:16:28,348 --> 00:16:32,283
Tails 40 fucking times, you know,
our luck's fucked.

103
00:16:33,718 --> 00:16:37,781
I know, we're going to make it.
Don't pay attention to that shit.

104
00:16:46,281 --> 00:16:48,686
You will be going for job
and nothing else.

105
00:16:50,911 --> 00:16:54,572
- What do you think?
- You're very handsome.

106
00:16:55,133 --> 00:16:56,236
They're going to love you.

107
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,899
Unshackle his legs.

108
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:20,530
Hey mister, you in charge here, you are
going to tell me what the hell's going on.

109
00:18:20,531 --> 00:18:23,520
- How do you feel?
- How do I feel?

110
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:29,723
Hey man. I have been in this goddamn box
for two and a half days, man.

111
00:18:29,724 --> 00:18:31,872
Tell me what's going on.
What do you all want from me?

112
00:18:32,073 --> 00:18:35,189
Give him shower.
Change your clothes, something fresh.

113
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,988
Where you all taking me, man?
Fuck you.

114
00:18:37,989 --> 00:18:40,514
- What about his stuff?
- What're you talking about?

115
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:43,287
Give it to him.

116
00:18:44,688 --> 00:18:46,043
Fuck you, guys.

117
00:19:04,134 --> 00:19:07,965
- Hello, Mr. Harrison?
- Yeah.

118
00:19:09,246 --> 00:19:12,884
Tomorrow at noon, go to the post
next door to Grand Central.

119
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:16,129
- Hang on.
- 200 West 39 Street.

120
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:18,393
Okay.

121
00:19:19,115 --> 00:19:23,079
With the key that you found with the
cellphone, you will open box 2-5-3.

122
00:19:24,449 --> 00:19:27,693
Inside you will find another train ticket,
more instructions.

123
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:33,580
Your ticket will be to Macomb, but you
will get off one stop before Macomb.

124
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:38,199
- One stop "before". Is that clear?
- Yeah.

125
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:47,045
Ticket, please.

126
00:21:03,538 --> 00:21:08,028
- He's getting off at Macomb.
- What time do we arrive?

127
00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:10,129
Train gets in at 3:10.

128
00:21:11,343 --> 00:21:15,133
Can I help you guys with anything else?
No, thank you.

129
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:29,187
Can I get a bottle of water
and a ham sandwich?

130
00:22:36,611 --> 00:22:40,999
You Flink? Yeah, get in. Thanks.

131
00:22:53,128 --> 00:22:54,783
I want to go here.

132
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:59,253
- You know it?
- Yeah.

133
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:02,768
- Is it far?
- No, it's right around the corner.

134
00:23:14,905 --> 00:23:17,273
That will be $17.70.

135
00:23:17,812 --> 00:23:20,296
- Keep the change.
- Wow, thank you.

136
00:24:24,331 --> 00:24:26,063
Give me your phone.

137
00:24:30,138 --> 00:24:31,236
Get in the car.

138
00:25:01,005 --> 00:25:03,370
- Which number is it?
- 13.

139
00:25:07,395 --> 00:25:08,975
Come on.

140
00:25:18,022 --> 00:25:19,452
Stand in the middle of the carpet.

141
00:25:25,498 --> 00:25:27,230
Take your clothes off.

142
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:38,675
Faster.

143
00:25:42,217 --> 00:25:43,984
Take off the rest.

144
00:25:57,666 --> 00:25:58,830
Get dressed.

145
00:26:01,504 --> 00:26:05,172
You didn't find it strange dropping off
somebody in the middle of nowhere?

146
00:26:05,173 --> 00:26:06,733
When the guy is paying me.
He's the customer.

147
00:26:06,734 --> 00:26:08,635
So, he can get out wherever he wants.

148
00:26:13,885 --> 00:26:16,610
- You didn't see anything else unusual?
- No.

149
00:26:17,221 --> 00:26:19,313
I just left him there and I left.

150
00:27:00,735 --> 00:27:01,967
Follow me.

151
00:27:09,612 --> 00:27:10,579
Have a seat.

152
00:27:42,381 --> 00:27:43,746
Who's that?

153
00:27:45,175 --> 00:27:46,148
I can explain.

154
00:27:47,257 --> 00:27:48,997
- I know..
- Shut up.

155
00:27:50,523 --> 00:27:51,808
Go get Jack.

156
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:07,201
You're probably wondering..

157
00:28:08,341 --> 00:28:09,655
- what I am doing here.
- Quiet.

158
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,283
Ah, Mr. Gomer.

159
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:22,887
Is this young man who's playing tonight?

160
00:28:24,127 --> 00:28:25,426
Yes, that's him.

161
00:28:30,234 --> 00:28:32,292
Very couragious.

162
00:28:57,531 --> 00:28:58,965
Two million.

163
00:28:59,466 --> 00:29:02,434
Put 700 thousand, on number six.

164
00:29:03,888 --> 00:29:05,234
What's going on?

165
00:29:06,406 --> 00:29:07,408
Who's he?

166
00:29:08,309 --> 00:29:10,376
What do you mean? He's the guy
I picked up at the intersection.

167
00:29:10,377 --> 00:29:11,612
He's not who I was expecting.

168
00:29:12,713 --> 00:29:15,436
- Well, he had the number.
- Harrison is dead.

169
00:29:16,918 --> 00:29:19,787
- What are you talking about?
- He OD'th.

170
00:29:20,222 --> 00:29:22,311
And who the fuck are you?

171
00:29:24,326 --> 00:29:27,624
I am an electrician.
I was working at his house.

172
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,764
Give me your ID.

173
00:29:38,274 --> 00:29:41,368
- Did he tell you about this?
- No, I overheard him talking.

174
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:44,895
I knew he was waiting for a letter
and it could be a lot of money.

175
00:29:44,896 --> 00:29:46,997
So I took it
and followed the instructions.

176
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:50,651
- Do you know what this is about?
- No.

177
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,823
No, I have no idea.

178
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:58,763
Follow me.

179
00:30:03,236 --> 00:30:05,025
Do you think the cops send him?

180
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:10,433
Maybe we should.. get out now.

181
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:13,334
If we leave and the cops show up..

182
00:30:13,335 --> 00:30:17,646
then the others will think we ratted.
We would be dead men.

183
00:30:21,256 --> 00:30:24,056
- Where you going?
- I should go and talk to them.

184
00:30:27,663 --> 00:30:29,522
Excuse me, gentlemen.

185
00:30:29,923 --> 00:30:30,823
Um..

186
00:30:31,267 --> 00:30:37,993
If it's a problem.. maybe, then..
then I think I should leave. I will leave.

187
00:30:38,274 --> 00:30:40,240
It's too late.

188
00:30:40,241 --> 00:30:41,935
What if I don't want to be here?

189
00:30:42,412 --> 00:30:44,641
You have to play now.

190
00:30:58,229 --> 00:31:01,322
600 thousand.. on number 13.

191
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:08,637
Good luck.

192
00:31:22,023 --> 00:31:25,085
Attention.
The first round is about to begin.

193
00:31:32,504 --> 00:31:34,104
Go fuck your mother.

194
00:31:34,605 --> 00:31:35,905
What's he saying?

195
00:31:36,505 --> 00:31:38,504
Cocksucker go fuck your mother.

196
00:31:38,505 --> 00:31:39,904
Attention.

197
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:42,569
You got to listen to him.

198
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:45,771
I am asking the guards
to please distribute the bullets.

199
00:31:46,349 --> 00:31:48,874
One bullet to each player.

200
00:31:54,493 --> 00:32:01,252
Hans, we are born only once
and we die only once.

201
00:32:02,199 --> 00:32:05,192
You must be philosophical, huh?

202
00:32:05,193 --> 00:32:09,600
You are the descended
of the great Schopenhauer.

203
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:38,729
I am asking all gamblers
to please step back.

204
00:32:40,508 --> 00:32:42,366
Please, gentlemen. Back up.

205
00:32:42,976 --> 00:32:44,040
Back up.

206
00:32:47,015 --> 00:32:48,482
Thank you, gentlemen.

207
00:32:55,225 --> 00:32:57,651
- Please boss.
- Have a seat.

208
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,327
Players.

209
00:33:02,498 --> 00:33:06,688
Load your bullets.. into their cylinders.

210
00:33:17,315 --> 00:33:19,182
What's going on 13?

211
00:33:19,183 --> 00:33:21,684
Do you have a problem number 13?

212
00:33:25,258 --> 00:33:26,258
One second.

213
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,351
No. No. No one gets up into the ring.
I am asking you to step down immediately.

214
00:33:30,352 --> 00:33:32,322
He doesn't know how to load his gun.

215
00:33:32,531 --> 00:33:33,532
Do you?

216
00:33:35,233 --> 00:33:37,371
- Pay attention.
- Open it like this.

217
00:33:38,234 --> 00:33:39,241
Round.

218
00:33:44,385 --> 00:33:46,656
Alright. Enough.

219
00:33:51,486 --> 00:33:52,850
Take your places.

220
00:33:56,825 --> 00:33:58,650
Raise your weapons.

221
00:34:04,223 --> 00:34:05,663
Higher.

222
00:34:06,001 --> 00:34:07,369
I want to see them.

223
00:34:09,906 --> 00:34:11,484
Spin your cylinders.

224
00:34:14,322 --> 00:34:16,181
More. More.
Keep it up.

225
00:34:26,144 --> 00:34:27,112
Stop.

226
00:34:29,694 --> 00:34:30,692
Aim.

227
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,167
Cock your hammers.

228
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:44,700
Number 13.
No turning around.

229
00:34:48,681 --> 00:34:53,942
Players, all eyes on the bulb.

230
00:34:56,056 --> 00:34:59,717
When the bulb lights up, you shoot.

231
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:52,410
Attention. Nobody move.

232
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:55,380
Number 13 did not shoot.

233
00:35:56,422 --> 00:35:59,557
Mr. Joe Garver, if your man
does not shoot, we will.

234
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:01,131
And you will be fined.

235
00:36:06,033 --> 00:36:08,801
What the fuck are you doing.
Pull the trigger.

236
00:36:10,151 --> 00:36:11,130
Shoot.

237
00:36:11,404 --> 00:36:12,879
Shoot, you son of a bitch.

238
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,108
- I am going to count, to three.
- Shoot.

239
00:36:16,109 --> 00:36:18,240
- One.
- Shoot.

240
00:36:18,241 --> 00:36:19,442
Two.

241
00:36:26,422 --> 00:36:29,415
Everyone, out of the ring.

242
00:36:36,066 --> 00:36:38,993
- Are you done with your little drama.
- Fuck you.

243
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:42,939
This is the last time you're trying
the bullshit, you get it?

244
00:37:04,065 --> 00:37:07,556
Hey.. how much money
they're paying you to watch my ass?

245
00:37:08,997 --> 00:37:10,246
What the fuck is it to you.

246
00:37:10,581 --> 00:37:13,763
I will give you 50 times more
what they're giving you.

247
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:15,909
You let me get my ass out of here.

248
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:18,437
If you got that kind of money,
why the fuck did you come here?

249
00:37:20,314 --> 00:37:22,544
What do you think,
I just waltzed in here, huh?

250
00:37:22,545 --> 00:37:24,277
These people kidnapped my ass.

251
00:37:28,557 --> 00:37:32,284
You like money, huh?
How's two millions sound?

252
00:37:33,262 --> 00:37:35,687
You know what you can do
with two million, huh?

253
00:37:35,688 --> 00:37:37,224
You get all the high class pussy,

254
00:37:37,225 --> 00:37:40,426
all the fancy cars, all the bubbly shit
you can drink, brother.

255
00:37:41,772 --> 00:37:44,802
Well, I can't do nothing for you so,
don't even think about it.

256
00:37:44,803 --> 00:37:46,286
What's the matter?

257
00:37:46,776 --> 00:37:49,278
- You don't like money?
- It's impossible.

258
00:37:49,279 --> 00:37:50,805
Come here, man.
Wait a minute.

259
00:37:50,806 --> 00:37:52,906
Come on.
Come here, man.

260
00:38:11,737 --> 00:38:15,133
- My man's out, I want to bet on yours.
- Sure.

261
00:38:15,134 --> 00:38:18,301
I take 50 points of the top,
just for this round.

262
00:38:19,349 --> 00:38:20,501
Okay.

263
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:30,415
- Want some morphin?
- No.

264
00:38:32,027 --> 00:38:33,987
- They all do it..
- I said, no.

265
00:38:41,404 --> 00:38:45,138
Hey, you lost your player, didn't you?
Son of a bitch.

266
00:38:45,942 --> 00:38:47,400
So, you're betting on the wrong man?

267
00:38:47,401 --> 00:38:50,408
Don't worry about him,
he has what he needs.

268
00:38:51,682 --> 00:38:53,550
Look, I don't know
what your deal with this guy is.

269
00:38:53,551 --> 00:38:55,250
I think I can do you one better.

270
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:59,021
60-40,
60 for you, 40 for me.

271
00:38:59,022 --> 00:39:01,353
You have to bet at least 400 thousand.

272
00:39:01,726 --> 00:39:04,186
Player number six,
he has the most experience.

273
00:39:04,662 --> 00:39:07,459
- You know who I am talking about.
- I know your player.

274
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,924
Made your offer, I just made mine.

275
00:39:12,304 --> 00:39:13,879
60-40 it is.

276
00:39:17,076 --> 00:39:18,441
Place your bets, gentlemen.

277
00:39:44,873 --> 00:39:46,597
Alright, on your feet now.

278
00:39:47,175 --> 00:39:49,710
Move it, let's go.

279
00:39:50,411 --> 00:39:51,411
Now.

280
00:39:54,416 --> 00:39:56,783
- I said, move it.
- Let's go.

281
00:39:57,084 --> 00:39:58,985
Get him on to his feet, now.

282
00:39:58,986 --> 00:40:01,820
You, get him on his feet.

283
00:40:02,821 --> 00:40:06,521
On your feet, gentlemen.
On your feet.

284
00:40:13,371 --> 00:40:17,496
Two bullets in each weapon.
Two bullets.

285
00:40:17,842 --> 00:40:23,104
Players, load your bullets
into their cylinders.

286
00:40:34,861 --> 00:40:36,359
Raise your weapons.

287
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,960
Higher.

288
00:40:46,007 --> 00:40:47,596
Spin your cylinders.

289
00:40:53,648 --> 00:40:58,316
- Keep it up. Keep it up.
- Faster. Faster. Faster.

290
00:41:05,761 --> 00:41:07,057
Stop.

291
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:13,634
Aim.

292
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,271
Cock your hammers.

293
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,039
Don't look me in the eye.

294
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:37,459
Eyes on the bulb.

295
00:42:18,008 --> 00:42:22,336
- Out of the ring.
- Collect the weapons, now.

296
00:42:48,842 --> 00:42:50,201
You're pretty lucky.

297
00:42:50,202 --> 00:42:53,603
The bullet is in the chamber,
he didn't have time to shoot.

298
00:42:56,317 --> 00:42:59,710
Lewis, one more round
and then we're through.

299
00:43:12,439 --> 00:43:13,506
Hans.

300
00:43:14,737 --> 00:43:16,307
Hans.

301
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,307
Bring him to me.

302
00:43:48,488 --> 00:43:49,988
Doctor, to the ring.

303
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:05,722
He can not continue.

304
00:44:08,163 --> 00:44:11,924
Wait, hold on. Hold on. Is this a
fucking game or a slaughterhouse?

305
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:15,859
My player didn't die in the game.
He is still alive.

306
00:44:18,507 --> 00:44:21,402
- What the hell is that.
- You know the rules Mr. Taylor.

307
00:44:26,203 --> 00:44:27,501
Hans.

308
00:44:28,753 --> 00:44:29,953
Hans.

309
00:44:31,054 --> 00:44:35,155
When you start something, you must
stay with it until the end.

310
00:44:36,292 --> 00:44:38,661
Nobody forced you to do this.

311
00:44:41,965 --> 00:44:43,323
You are two for two.

312
00:44:44,134 --> 00:44:46,193
You are great.

313
00:44:46,494 --> 00:44:48,894
You are great..

314
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,596
How much I win
for the first two rounds?

315
00:45:16,436 --> 00:45:18,148
2.9 million.

316
00:45:21,029 --> 00:45:22,245
Excuse me, sir.

317
00:45:22,675 --> 00:45:23,645
Excuse me.

318
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,562
You need to pick your number.

319
00:45:29,926 --> 00:45:30,826
What you got?

320
00:45:33,127 --> 00:45:35,415
I will be standing behind Player 13.

321
00:45:40,601 --> 00:45:43,792
I want to bet the 2.9 plus an
addition of 1.2.

322
00:45:47,936 --> 00:45:50,171
If you make it to the end,
you will make a lot of money.

323
00:45:51,765 --> 00:45:53,335
What the fuck do you care?

324
00:45:57,282 --> 00:45:58,724
Just making conversation.

325
00:46:13,557 --> 00:46:17,615
Three million.
Okay, three million.

326
00:46:18,674 --> 00:46:20,788
I will give you three million dollars.

327
00:46:20,789 --> 00:46:22,460
Okay, that will change your life forever.

328
00:46:22,461 --> 00:46:24,962
Where you planning
on getting all this money?

329
00:46:25,345 --> 00:46:26,261
Listen.

330
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,947
Me and a couple of my boys,
we hit this armored car in Mexico.

331
00:46:32,328 --> 00:46:34,826
My two partners they got blown away.

332
00:46:34,827 --> 00:46:36,749
I got away for about a day and a half.

333
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:40,569
I had enough time where I got rid
of the truck and I hid the money.

334
00:46:42,018 --> 00:46:45,163
If you got that kind of money, how is
it they let you out of the prison?

335
00:46:45,475 --> 00:46:47,401
You should have been a gold mine for them.

336
00:46:49,367 --> 00:46:55,102
Shit man.. They beat my ass in that
jail, but I didn't talk, okay?

337
00:46:55,425 --> 00:46:58,163
I didn't say a goddamn word.
Listen, if I would have said something..

338
00:46:58,164 --> 00:47:00,565
they would have smoked my ass,
and taking the money.

339
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:04,309
I got the money.
I got a lot of fucking money.

340
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:10,541
Finish the game & you will leave
peacefully. In your case there's no
way you escape.

341
00:47:10,928 --> 00:47:13,624
They will blow both our brains out,
before we got in to front door.

342
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:17,132
You have a better chance
to survive in the ring.

343
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:21,805
Please, give me something
to write with it.

344
00:47:54,242 --> 00:47:58,281
- I want my money.
- Don't worry about the money.

345
00:47:58,282 --> 00:48:00,516
What's important,
to see you go all the way.

346
00:48:05,956 --> 00:48:07,688
It's pretty fucked up, huh?

347
00:48:09,159 --> 00:48:10,328
We two are brothers.

348
00:48:18,903 --> 00:48:20,778
I hate that fucking number.

349
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,310
Bang.

350
00:48:38,734 --> 00:48:40,259
Calm down.

351
00:48:40,861 --> 00:48:43,364
- Just let it go.
- Calm down a little bit.

352
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:46,842
Forget about it.

353
00:48:58,981 --> 00:49:02,981
Shot two already.
He shoots three, you get a bonus.

354
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:05,576
Uh-huh.
That would be wonderful.

355
00:49:06,121 --> 00:49:08,899
- How much do I have?
- 1.1 million.

356
00:49:18,154 --> 00:49:19,324
Listen, man..

357
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:26,863
I got all the details, of where I buried
all the money, there's a map here.

358
00:49:26,864 --> 00:49:30,447
- Listen to me, man.
- I got a son.

359
00:49:31,182 --> 00:49:33,645
He's doing some time.
He got another..

360
00:49:33,646 --> 00:49:36,047
I don't know 18 months to go, so..

361
00:49:37,281 --> 00:49:42,244
If anything happens to me,
and I don't make it out of here..

362
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:44,831
I want you to take this note
out of my pocket,

363
00:49:44,832 --> 00:49:47,933
go get that money, and I want
you to split with him.

364
00:49:48,483 --> 00:49:53,889
- We got a deal?
- Okay, you got it.

365
00:49:59,179 --> 00:50:00,688
Thirteen.

366
00:50:13,054 --> 00:50:14,228
Number six.

367
00:50:29,072 --> 00:50:30,497
Number three.

368
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:48,567
Eleven.

369
00:50:51,474 --> 00:50:52,785
Eleven.

370
00:51:07,154 --> 00:51:08,639
You can take him now.

371
00:51:19,724 --> 00:51:21,197
You're going down.

372
00:51:22,432 --> 00:51:24,296
What the fuck do you want?

373
00:51:26,991 --> 00:51:28,696
Alright, enough.

374
00:51:42,994 --> 00:51:44,417
Mr. Schlöndorf.

375
00:51:44,718 --> 00:51:48,516
Why isn't your player in the ring?
He must step up immediately.

376
00:51:48,517 --> 00:51:52,926
- He will be there. He will be there.
- The third round is about to begin.

377
00:51:52,927 --> 00:51:57,176
- What's wrong with him?
- Just a little case of the runs.

378
00:51:57,811 --> 00:51:59,674
Get him up there.

379
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:01,975
Come on.

380
00:52:10,781 --> 00:52:12,155
Give him his gun.

381
00:52:21,368 --> 00:52:26,528
For the third round,
I will ask the guards to distribute..

382
00:52:27,107 --> 00:52:31,137
three bullets to each player.

383
00:52:31,138 --> 00:52:32,313
Three bullets.

384
00:52:50,533 --> 00:52:51,966
Sir, please.

385
00:52:53,001 --> 00:52:56,371
Can I please have a chair for my player?
He's not feeling too well.

386
00:53:01,846 --> 00:53:05,880
That guy wants a chair for Number 3.
He's got a hard time standing.

387
00:53:05,881 --> 00:53:07,147
Get him a chair.

388
00:53:24,304 --> 00:53:25,634
Thank you.

389
00:53:27,241 --> 00:53:32,419
Players.. load the bullets
in their cylinders.

390
00:53:46,091 --> 00:53:47,346
Raise your weapons.

391
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,332
Spin your cylinders.

392
00:53:58,033 --> 00:53:59,101
More.

393
00:54:01,178 --> 00:54:02,542
Stop.

394
00:54:05,049 --> 00:54:06,578
Aim.

395
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:13,550
Cock your hammers.

396
00:54:23,002 --> 00:54:27,547
All players.. eyes on the bulb.

397
00:54:57,306 --> 00:55:00,770
- Out of the ring.
- Collect the weapons.

398
00:55:14,459 --> 00:55:19,220
Gentlemen, we are at the last stage
of our game.

399
00:55:19,521 --> 00:55:20,883
The duel.

400
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:25,370
On the table, there are five balls.

401
00:55:25,705 --> 00:55:28,462
Three white, two black.

402
00:55:28,697 --> 00:55:32,477
The black, will designate the duelists.

403
00:55:33,846 --> 00:55:42,273
I will now call the gamblers
representing number 6, 9, 13, 17 and 3.

404
00:55:49,396 --> 00:55:53,784
I will ask that you unwrap the balls,
high above your heads..

405
00:55:53,785 --> 00:55:59,439
so that everyone can see.
Gentlemen, good luck.

406
00:56:25,436 --> 00:56:28,439
Gentlemen, place your bets.

407
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:29,716
Okay. Wait. Wait.

408
00:56:31,017 --> 00:56:33,390
I am not accepting any offers
under 85 percent.

409
00:56:33,391 --> 00:56:35,992
Nothing less than 300 thousand.

410
00:57:12,988 --> 00:57:14,903
Hey. Let him go.

411
00:57:22,098 --> 00:57:27,155
What the fuck are you doing?
Nobody touches the survivors. Nobody.

412
00:57:29,403 --> 00:57:30,555
Fuck.

413
00:57:31,439 --> 00:57:34,693
You know that story I told you about,
and all that money?

414
00:57:35,345 --> 00:57:38,375
All that money I told you about. Huh?

415
00:57:38,783 --> 00:57:41,315
All that money you think
you were going to be holding on to..

416
00:57:41,716 --> 00:57:43,316
huh? All that money?

417
00:57:44,055 --> 00:57:46,628
You think you would have been
a holding on to, Jimmy,

418
00:57:46,902 --> 00:57:49,626
would have been your dick.
Okay, son?

419
00:57:51,263 --> 00:57:53,298
Happy trails, partner.

420
00:58:01,742 --> 00:58:05,636
What's going up between you two?
I just want to get the fuck out of here.

421
00:58:06,212 --> 00:58:09,518
Well get dressed and come get your money.
You free to go.

422
00:58:48,928 --> 00:58:55,449
# Happy trails to you.
Until we meet again. #

423
00:58:56,198 --> 00:59:02,939
# Happy trails to you, motherfuckers,
until we meet again. #

424
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,140
# Happy trails to you. #

425
00:59:12,489 --> 00:59:13,971
Mr. Gomer.

426
00:59:15,688 --> 00:59:18,668
I would like to bet on your boy.

427
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:22,935
Our player has no experience, and at
this stage of the game, it's important.

428
00:59:25,333 --> 00:59:28,985
- How much do you want?
- I want 80 percent.

429
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:32,176
No, no, no, no, no.
That's too much.

430
00:59:32,511 --> 00:59:35,164
The two brothers they're not offering
you much better.

431
00:59:35,165 --> 00:59:37,747
Besides we launch out at 5 to 1,
You'd make more money,

432
00:59:37,948 --> 00:59:39,848
everyone is betting on them.

433
00:59:41,482 --> 00:59:42,798
Yeah.

434
00:59:44,287 --> 00:59:47,605
Alright, we will do business.

435
00:59:56,233 --> 00:59:58,800
- It's almost time number one.
- Oh.

436
01:00:03,007 --> 01:00:08,315
If this works out well, Jasper.
I want my fucking share.

437
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:14,504
Of course. But there's not a
lot of people betting on us.

438
01:00:15,822 --> 01:00:17,495
We're not going to be able
to make that much money.

439
01:00:17,996 --> 01:00:20,195
Shut your fucking mouth, you cunt.

440
01:00:20,196 --> 01:00:21,769
Shut your fucking mouth.

441
01:00:29,169 --> 01:00:30,966
I fucking know you.

442
01:00:34,475 --> 01:00:36,342
I know you.

443
01:00:42,118 --> 01:00:47,023
Oh, I have been, uh..
thinking a lot, lately.

444
01:00:49,425 --> 01:00:51,089
What're you talking about?

445
01:01:01,371 --> 01:01:04,548
Mummy and daddy had left you
enough money to look after me.

446
01:01:10,852 --> 01:01:14,511
You stucked me in that fucking hospital.

447
01:01:17,222 --> 01:01:19,919
- That hospital cost me a lot of money.
- Hm..

448
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:28,521
You have earned more money on me playing
this fucking game in these past years.

449
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:34,471
- And you're a fucking monster.
- That's horseshit.

450
01:01:34,472 --> 01:01:38,496
When I am in that certain hell,
I want my fucking money.

451
01:01:50,148 --> 01:01:51,423
Against the wall.

452
01:01:57,433 --> 01:01:58,563
Against the wall.

453
01:02:02,204 --> 01:02:03,832
- Shit.
- What?

454
01:02:03,833 --> 01:02:06,330
The trigger's too fucking tight.
It's too big.

455
01:02:06,744 --> 01:02:08,011
They're all the same.

456
01:02:18,891 --> 01:02:20,106
Thirteen.

457
01:02:25,524 --> 01:02:26,608
Six.

458
01:02:34,339 --> 01:02:35,307
One.

459
01:02:37,543 --> 01:02:38,510
Two.

460
01:02:41,147 --> 01:02:42,214
Three.

461
01:02:52,393 --> 01:02:54,188
- Good for you?
- Okay.

462
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:14,311
Players to the center of the ring.

463
01:03:29,467 --> 01:03:30,697
Raise your weapons.

464
01:03:37,609 --> 01:03:39,342
Spin your cylinders.

465
01:03:48,035 --> 01:03:49,156
More.

466
01:03:53,232 --> 01:03:54,399
Stop.

467
01:04:02,912 --> 01:04:04,144
Aim.

468
01:04:08,476 --> 01:04:10,007
Cock your hammers.

469
01:04:12,514 --> 01:04:18,322
Eyes on the bulb.
When it lights up, you shoot.

470
01:05:11,847 --> 01:05:15,603
Attention, gentlemen.
The duel will continue.

471
01:05:16,685 --> 01:05:21,364
I will ask for an additional bullet,
in each cylinder.

472
01:05:22,525 --> 01:05:27,584
One, two, three.. four.

473
01:05:33,568 --> 01:05:39,512
One, two, three.. four bullets.

474
01:05:53,218 --> 01:05:55,792
Players, please step forward.

475
01:06:04,838 --> 01:06:06,265
Raise your weapons.

476
01:06:11,709 --> 01:06:13,465
Spin your cylinders.

477
01:06:18,076 --> 01:06:19,159
More.

478
01:06:32,529 --> 01:06:33,597
Stop.

479
01:06:37,173 --> 01:06:38,762
Aim.

480
01:06:41,096 --> 01:06:42,537
Cock your hammers.

481
01:06:47,243 --> 01:06:49,659
When the bulb lights up, you shoot.

482
01:07:17,346 --> 01:07:20,191
I win my bets,
when the odds are against me.

483
01:07:30,184 --> 01:07:33,592
- Gentlemen.
- The game is over.

484
01:07:34,936 --> 01:07:36,120
It's finished.

485
01:07:42,467 --> 01:07:46,123
And the winner.. is Number 13.

486
01:07:48,818 --> 01:07:52,666
Congratulations, 13.
Congratulations.

487
01:08:01,692 --> 01:08:05,540
Fuck. Fuck.
Fuck it.

488
01:08:20,727 --> 01:08:25,135
Well done, young man.
Well done.

489
01:08:33,683 --> 01:08:35,407
Have a seat.

490
01:08:49,895 --> 01:08:58,295
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

491
01:09:00,396 --> 01:09:05,378
Congratulations.
1 million 850 thousand dollars.

492
01:09:07,437 --> 01:09:09,225
You realize how lucky you are?

493
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:12,499
Your opponent won his last three duels.

494
01:09:26,391 --> 01:09:29,309
- Are you satisfied?
- Yeah.

495
01:09:30,051 --> 01:09:31,915
If you want we can give you a ride.

496
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:36,664
- Where?
- It doesn't matter.

497
01:09:36,665 --> 01:09:40,362
We can drop you off to the nearest
train station if.. you like.

498
01:09:41,475 --> 01:09:46,496
Yeah, I will get my things
I meet you downstairs.

499
01:09:47,281 --> 01:09:51,483
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you.

500
01:09:55,456 --> 01:09:59,216
- Where you going?
- I am going with him.

501
01:10:03,232 --> 01:10:07,003
Why don't you go to the room,
get our coats.

502
01:11:31,993 --> 01:11:33,169
I couldn't find him.

503
01:11:34,943 --> 01:11:36,266
Get in the car.

504
01:12:03,396 --> 01:12:05,017
Sir, your total is going to be 38.

505
01:12:08,536 --> 01:12:09,732
Thank you.

506
01:12:34,472 --> 01:12:35,557
Hi.

507
01:12:35,901 --> 01:12:39,882
Hi, Officer Stellar. This is Claudio,
the cab driver from yesterday.

508
01:12:39,883 --> 01:12:41,255
Yeah.

509
01:12:42,513 --> 01:12:45,757
Yeah, I just saw your guy.
Yeah, at the station.

510
01:12:46,102 --> 01:12:48,436
Huh? Yeah, he's here now.

511
01:14:11,898 --> 01:14:13,200
That's him, right there.

512
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:16,438
- He's on your side.
- That's your guy. That's him.

513
01:14:16,439 --> 01:14:17,479
Blue jacket, seated.

514
01:14:21,848 --> 01:14:25,904
Excuse me, sir,
come with us, please.

515
01:14:37,002 --> 01:14:40,497
- You want him uncuffed?
- Uncuff him.

516
01:14:48,344 --> 01:14:50,657
Leave us alone.
Thank you.

517
01:15:05,659 --> 01:15:07,375
Where did you hide the money?

518
01:15:07,810 --> 01:15:09,433
I don't know what you're talking about?

519
01:15:12,689 --> 01:15:13,798
Sit down.

520
01:15:17,005 --> 01:15:18,603
I said, sit down.

521
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:29,317
You're not under arrest, Vincent.

522
01:15:29,952 --> 01:15:33,341
And you won't be as long as you tell me
everything that went on out there.

523
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:39,081
- I never met them.
- Don't bullshit me.

524
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:41,485
I am telling the truth.

525
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:44,504
Why did they pick you up
at the intersection..

526
01:15:44,505 --> 01:15:45,906
if they're looking for Harrison.

527
01:15:48,343 --> 01:15:50,444
The driver didn't know Harrison.

528
01:15:50,897 --> 01:15:53,660
When he pulled up,
I flashed him the signal.

529
01:15:54,061 --> 01:15:55,092
A signal?

530
01:15:56,319 --> 01:15:58,316
A piece of cardboard with a number.

531
01:16:12,076 --> 01:16:15,114
- Where did he drop you?
- Somewhere in the forest.

532
01:16:16,207 --> 01:16:17,608
What happened?

533
01:16:18,509 --> 01:16:21,518
When I got there, there were
2 other guys waiting in another car.

534
01:16:23,514 --> 01:16:26,341
When they saw me, I knew I was screwed.

535
01:16:27,319 --> 01:16:31,200
I told them Harrison was dead,
and I was willing to take his place.

536
01:16:31,201 --> 01:16:35,843
But they didn't go for it. Either
they didn't believe me, or whatever.

537
01:16:36,044 --> 01:16:37,611
But they didn't want me to be there.

538
01:16:39,107 --> 01:16:43,700
I saw one of the men had a gun.
When he reached for it, I reacted.

539
01:16:43,701 --> 01:16:46,803
I ran and I just kept running.

540
01:16:46,804 --> 01:16:50,246
- Did they chase you?
- They chased me, they shot at me.

541
01:16:52,899 --> 01:16:54,674
But I just kept running.

542
01:16:55,584 --> 01:16:58,316
I ran so hard that I lost the heels
of my shoes.

543
01:17:11,401 --> 01:17:14,192
If you saw them again,
would you be able to identify them?

544
01:17:14,954 --> 01:17:16,481
Of course.

545
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:20,111
Could you take me to that place
in the forest?

546
01:17:21,212 --> 01:17:24,683
I was in a panic.
I have been running for hours.

547
01:17:24,684 --> 01:17:28,404
It was dark. How the fuck do you
expect me to remember where I was?

548
01:17:29,105 --> 01:17:32,746
But if we took you to that intersection,
you'd get your bearings, right?

549
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:37,509
The driver blindfolded me.

550
01:17:40,166 --> 01:17:41,600
You're lying.

551
01:17:42,101 --> 01:17:43,428
I am telling the truth.

552
01:17:48,408 --> 01:17:50,128
Put your boots back on.

553
01:18:10,365 --> 01:18:11,806
Can I go now?

554
01:20:22,338 --> 01:20:24,129
Twenty two dollars please.

555
01:20:42,036 --> 01:20:43,236
Hello?

556
01:20:44,037 --> 01:20:46,477
- Mom?
- Vince.

557
01:20:46,478 --> 01:20:49,647
How's dad?
How is everything?

558
01:20:49,648 --> 01:20:52,333
Everything is the same.
He was wondering about you.

559
01:20:52,334 --> 01:20:56,556
- Where are you?
- I am still in Chicago.

560
01:20:56,557 --> 01:21:01,450
- How much longer?
- Not long, I will be home soon.

561
01:21:01,451 --> 01:21:06,317
What.. what happened? Everything go okay?
Listen mom, I send some money in the mail.

562
01:21:06,679 --> 01:21:08,422
Certified mail.

563
01:21:08,423 --> 01:21:11,370
- Money?
- A lot of money.

564
01:21:11,371 --> 01:21:15,407
If you are not home,
have Clara wait for it, okay.

565
01:21:15,408 --> 01:21:18,048
What do you mean money?
From where?

566
01:21:18,049 --> 01:21:21,631
I will explain everything later.
Just make sure somebody is home.

567
01:21:22,342 --> 01:21:26,151
You're scaring me, Vincent.
Are you in trouble?

568
01:21:26,152 --> 01:21:30,745
No, everything's fine. Just make sure
somebody is home tomorrow, okay.

569
01:21:30,746 --> 01:21:34,897
Vincent, please tell me what's going on.
I love you.

570
01:22:43,968 --> 01:22:45,331
Eighteen twenty-five.

571
01:22:48,998 --> 01:22:50,600
How much for the lamb?

572
01:22:51,926 --> 01:22:55,648
- It's not for sale.
- I will give you 100 bucks.

573
01:22:55,649 --> 01:22:57,732
- For the lamb?
- Yeah.

574
01:25:02,917 --> 01:25:04,049
It's snowing.

575
01:25:08,329 --> 01:25:09,733
Yeah.

576
01:25:15,664 --> 01:25:17,353
Going far?

577
01:25:19,363 --> 01:25:21,087
I am going home.

578
01:25:22,818 --> 01:25:24,269
Where?

579
01:25:27,281 --> 01:25:28,943
Ohio.

580
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:31,590
