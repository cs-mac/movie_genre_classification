00:00:25.148 --> 00:00:27.063
I'm building a new city here.

10
00:00:28.422 --> 00:00:29.766
Every wealth will be spread out.

11
00:00:29.828 --> 00:00:31.063
There will be no class.

12
00:00:32.422 --> 00:00:34.787
Everyone will be equal.

13
00:00:36.664 --> 00:00:37.731
It's my dream...

14
00:00:38.891 --> 00:00:39.891
My passion...

15
00:00:41.953 --> 00:00:43.086
Will you...

16
00:00:43.852 --> 00:00:44.852
Help me?

17
00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:52.624
(2017, on Let's Have Dinner's 1st year.)

(City of Suwon, Gyeonggido.)

19
00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.301
2017 is so hot.

20
00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:00.868
(So hot.)

21
00:01:01.234 --> 00:01:04.059
(Burning.)

22
00:01:04.188 --> 00:01:05.799
It's been hot for a while.

23
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.800
It still is!

24
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.501
(A Sunday under the last heat wave.)

25
00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:12.406
Do you know where we are?

26
00:01:12.633 --> 00:01:13.671
Hwasung in Suwon.

27
00:01:13.672 --> 00:01:14.672
Suwon!

28
00:01:15.422 --> 00:01:16.578
It looks very old.

29
00:01:16.625 --> 00:01:17.766
We should do a new version

30
00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:19.813
of Let's Have Dinner Together.

31
00:01:20.164 --> 00:01:21.726
Why don't we do a version

32
00:01:22.211 --> 00:01:24.094
that focuses on humanities studies?

33
00:01:24.156 --> 00:01:25.156
Sure.

34
00:01:25.172 --> 00:01:26.172
Let me start.

35
00:01:26.492 --> 00:01:28.078
The city of Suwon...

36
00:01:28.453 --> 00:01:29.453
Has a UNESCO's...

37
00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.258
World Heritage site.

38
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.867
Did you know that?

39
00:01:34.086 --> 00:01:35.086
Of course.

40
00:01:35.688 --> 00:01:37.629
King Jungjo...

41
00:01:37.828 --> 00:01:40.242
(Google search battle...)

42
00:01:40.688 --> 00:01:42.299
King Jungjo was Chosun's 22nd king.

43
00:01:42.484 --> 00:01:44.385
He gave orders...

44
00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:48.102
To Jung Yak-Yong to build a castle

45
00:01:48.195 --> 00:01:49.305
in Suwon.

46
00:01:50.352 --> 00:01:52.882
He got a lot of people to move here.

47
00:01:53.625 --> 00:01:56.375
This is the first new town in Korea.

48
00:01:56.453 --> 00:01:58.786
It's a planned city by King Jungjo.

49
00:01:59.078 --> 00:02:00.218
It's Chosun's Bundang.

50
00:02:01.672 --> 00:02:03.422
Thing of it as Bundang.

51
00:02:04.305 --> 00:02:05.305
He's right.

52
00:02:05.563 --> 00:02:07.648
Chosun's first planned city,

53
00:02:07.953 --> 00:02:09.153
Suwon, Gyeonggido.

54
00:02:11.148 --> 00:02:13.155
The 22nd king of Chosun, King Jungjo

55
00:02:13.156 --> 00:02:15.188
opened the Renaissance era in Korea.

56
00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:17.729
As he moved his father's grave

57
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.887
to Yunggeollung,

58
00:02:18.914 --> 00:02:21.156
the best site in Korea,

59
00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:24.022
he planned to build a new city

60
00:02:24.023 --> 00:02:25.875
of his dreams here.

61
00:02:27.102 --> 00:02:29.297
We know that city as Suwon today.

62
00:02:30.703 --> 00:02:32.421
He hired noted scholars such as

63
00:02:32.422 --> 00:02:33.422
Jung Yak-Yong

64
00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:35.063
he built Suwon and Hwasung castle

65
00:02:35.242 --> 00:02:36.938
with meticulous planning.

66
00:02:37.586 --> 00:02:39.909
With unrivaled building technology,

67
00:02:40.375 --> 00:02:41.913
it was chosen as UNESCO's

68
00:02:41.914 --> 00:02:44.313
World Heritage in 1997.

69
00:02:45.203 --> 00:02:47.031
In a city of King Jungjo's dreams,

70
00:02:47.492 --> 00:02:48.812
can the 4 spoons dream

71
00:02:48.813 --> 00:02:50.422
to have a meal become true?

72
00:02:51.547 --> 00:02:52.664
Let's Have Dinner Together,

73
00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:53.719
episode 46.

74
00:02:53.844 --> 00:02:55.044
A Dream of a Meal.

75
00:02:55.891 --> 00:02:59.280
What can you tell us about Suwon?

76
00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:00.359
Suwon is...

77
00:03:00.688 --> 00:03:01.821
An amazing place.

78
00:03:02.428 --> 00:03:04.584
(Kyu-dong tours Hwasung.)

79
00:03:04.616 --> 00:03:05.816
They're all walls.

80
00:03:05.827 --> 00:03:06.827
Wait...

81
00:03:06.975 --> 00:03:07.975
Is that a bow?

82
00:03:09.163 --> 00:03:10.343
This is an archery.

83
00:03:10.381 --> 00:03:12.194
That's awesome.

84
00:03:13.038 --> 00:03:14.880
(200 years old training ground)

85
00:03:14.881 --> 00:03:16.147
(where soldiers used to train.)

86
00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:18.772
They're amazing.

87
00:03:18.834 --> 00:03:19.834
Should we try?

88
00:03:22.207 --> 00:03:24.207
(And...)

89
00:03:26.303 --> 00:03:28.319
(These two stand out)

90
00:03:28.358 --> 00:03:30.158
(amongst the rest.)

91
00:03:31.866 --> 00:03:34.363
I'm sure our guests are here too!

92
00:03:34.725 --> 00:03:37.835
(Are archers today's guests?)

93
00:03:37.913 --> 00:03:39.178
Hi!

94
00:03:39.397 --> 00:03:40.397
Hi.

95
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.971
Did you see any famous people here?

96
00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.280
You guys aren't Koreans?

97
00:03:45.084 --> 00:03:46.334
Taiwan?

98
00:03:49.444 --> 00:03:52.042
(While they failed to get a hint...)

99
00:03:52.108 --> 00:03:55.134
(Who are they...?)

100
00:03:55.194 --> 00:03:56.194
It's them.

101
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:57.844
Hi guests!

102
00:03:58.522 --> 00:04:00.782
(Ignores them for now...)

103
00:04:00.827 --> 00:04:01.827
Guests!

104
00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:05.459
Hi!

105
00:04:05.475 --> 00:04:08.044
(Who are today's guests?)

106
00:04:08.725 --> 00:04:10.834
They shot some arrows as a girl group.

107
00:04:10.983 --> 00:04:12.976
The definition of Korean girl groups,

108
00:04:13.584 --> 00:04:14.918
Girls' Generations's

109
00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.618
Sunny and Yu-ri are today's guests.

110
00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:17.819
Sunny!

111
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.170
Yu-ri!

112
00:04:19.241 --> 00:04:21.053
(Welcome.)

113
00:04:21.123 --> 00:04:22.694
You came all the way to Suwon!

114
00:04:22.788 --> 00:04:24.803
The only generation that I know...

115
00:04:25.108 --> 00:04:26.508
Is Girls' Generation.

116
00:04:26.944 --> 00:04:27.944
They have 10 people!

117
00:04:28.014 --> 00:04:29.014
What?

118
00:04:29.491 --> 00:04:31.131
(They don't?)

119
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.230
I read the news article...

120
00:04:32.616 --> 00:04:34.246
I heard for the 1st time in 10 years...

121
00:04:34.717 --> 00:04:36.394
No, not 1st time in 10 years...

122
00:04:36.655 --> 00:04:38.329
Oops.

123
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.506
I heard this is their 10th year.

124
00:04:41.538 --> 00:04:43.130
They came to Ask Us Anything and Sunny

125
00:04:43.131 --> 00:04:44.443
chose you as her role model.

126
00:04:44.444 --> 00:04:45.444
Really?

127
00:04:45.655 --> 00:04:47.449
Because you don't listen to others.

128
00:04:49.975 --> 00:04:51.658
She said you're her hero.

129
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.443
I want to be the little Lee Kyung-kyu!

130
00:04:54.397 --> 00:04:56.005
Sunny and I went to

131
00:04:56.006 --> 00:04:57.940
a lot of traditional bazaars.

132
00:04:58.694 --> 00:05:00.116
Sunny told me that

133
00:05:00.272 --> 00:05:02.133
you take so long to record a show!

134
00:05:02.405 --> 00:05:03.893
I even ran away from him.

135
00:05:04.006 --> 00:05:05.961
She said you take at least 6 hours.

136
00:05:06.022 --> 00:05:07.232
(I completely understand.)

137
00:05:07.233 --> 00:05:08.627
I hope that doesn't happen today.

138
00:05:09.444 --> 00:05:11.148
There are a lot of bazaars here.

139
00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:12.647
How much do you know about Suwon?

140
00:05:12.756 --> 00:05:16.505
I shot a drama called Neighborhood Hero

141
00:05:16.506 --> 00:05:17.694
in Suwon.

142
00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:18.741
You did?

143
00:05:18.803 --> 00:05:21.835
I spent about 3 months here.

144
00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:23.481
Then tell us a little bit about Suwon.

145
00:05:24.147 --> 00:05:25.584
Suwon is...

146
00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:27.752
Known for galbi!

147
00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:30.819
It's here!

148
00:05:31.825 --> 00:05:33.962
(Where are we going today?)

149
00:05:34.038 --> 00:05:35.954
Go to Hwaseodong in Suwon

150
00:05:35.955 --> 00:05:37.945
to have a meal.

151
00:05:38.506 --> 00:05:39.694
Where's Hwaseodong?

152
00:05:39.741 --> 00:05:41.340
Close by?

153
00:05:41.475 --> 00:05:43.005
Look what's inside.

154
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.209
There's a transportation card...

155
00:05:46.194 --> 00:05:48.436
There's a ticket for Hwasung Royal Train!

156
00:05:49.163 --> 00:05:50.818
I saw it right in front.

157
00:05:50.983 --> 00:05:51.983
Let's go!

158
00:05:52.912 --> 00:05:55.123
(Before going to Hwaseodong...)

159
00:05:55.124 --> 00:05:56.654
They decide to get on

160
00:05:56.655 --> 00:05:58.084
the Hwasung Royal Train

161
00:05:58.186 --> 00:06:00.613
to look around Hwasung.

162
00:06:02.498 --> 00:06:04.951
(What does it look like?)

163
00:06:04.952 --> 00:06:05.952
There it is!

164
00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.030
This way.

165
00:06:09.256 --> 00:06:10.966
(Made with inspirations from)

166
00:06:10.967 --> 00:06:12.725
(Emperor Sunjong's car and carriers.)

167
00:06:14.116 --> 00:06:15.420
It even has seat belts.

168
00:06:15.772 --> 00:06:16.772
Let's go!

169
00:06:17.498 --> 00:06:20.623
Here are some facts about Suwon's Hwasung.

170
00:06:20.756 --> 00:06:22.319
They're teaching us about Hwasung!

171
00:06:23.295 --> 00:06:25.772
You can see Dongjangdae to the front.

172
00:06:26.241 --> 00:06:27.802
This is where King Jungjo

173
00:06:27.803 --> 00:06:30.708
inspected his soldiers too.

174
00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:32.772
It's telling us what each area was

175
00:06:33.467 --> 00:06:35.358
as we drive by!

176
00:06:36.538 --> 00:06:40.635
(Time travel back to 200 years ago...)

177
00:06:42.647 --> 00:06:45.068
(Very detailed explanation.)

178
00:06:45.631 --> 00:06:47.074
Willow trees!

179
00:06:47.147 --> 00:06:50.924
(Google search not necessary.)

180
00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:53.269
You'll be the one shooting arrows,

181
00:06:53.295 --> 00:06:55.200
and I'll be order you to shoot!

182
00:06:56.272 --> 00:06:57.918
Because you're my general?

183
00:06:59.233 --> 00:07:01.332
(Acts like a general.)

184
00:07:01.358 --> 00:07:03.584
(They reply history with comedy.)

185
00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:04.631
It's nice here.

186
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.260
It feels so nice!

187
00:07:06.756 --> 00:07:08.200
This wind feels nice.

188
00:07:08.272 --> 00:07:10.333
(There's no need to walk.)

189
00:07:10.694 --> 00:07:12.014
Hi!

190
00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:15.056
(Tries to have a conversation right away.)

191
00:07:15.303 --> 00:07:16.303
Hi!

192
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.837
When did you guys get on?

193
00:07:19.608 --> 00:07:21.452
Make some noise!

194
00:07:23.538 --> 00:07:24.873
There were that many people?

195
00:07:24.983 --> 00:07:26.779
I didn't see either.

196
00:07:27.647 --> 00:07:30.194
(This train is very popular.)

197
00:07:30.366 --> 00:07:32.014
King Jungjo!

198
00:07:32.061 --> 00:07:34.573
(King Jungjo?)

199
00:07:34.959 --> 00:07:38.236
(A giant statue.)

200
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:41.752
(Welcome.)

201
00:07:41.905 --> 00:07:47.068
He was also famous for being good looking!

202
00:07:47.553 --> 00:07:49.129
What else do you know about him?

203
00:07:50.022 --> 00:07:51.821
Hyun Bin from The Fatal Encounter!

204
00:07:51.866 --> 00:07:53.780
That's why I asked.

205
00:07:54.139 --> 00:07:55.507
His back muscles.

206
00:07:57.491 --> 00:07:59.288
(Angry back muscles.)

207
00:07:59.366 --> 00:08:00.861
To protect himself,

208
00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:04.406
King Jungjo worked out day and night.

209
00:08:04.756 --> 00:08:06.294
Hyun Bin's back muscles shed light

210
00:08:06.295 --> 00:08:07.629
to this story again.

211
00:08:07.741 --> 00:08:09.007
I think it was when

212
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.021
he was shooting that movie

213
00:08:11.022 --> 00:08:12.749
and had to work out a lot.

214
00:08:13.084 --> 00:08:14.473
I met him at a sauna.

215
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.193
For the first time, I thought

216
00:08:17.194 --> 00:08:18.394
my body was disgusting.

217
00:08:21.733 --> 00:08:23.881
(Found the truth after 45 years.)

218
00:08:23.928 --> 00:08:25.271
I walked in that sauna

219
00:08:25.272 --> 00:08:27.249
and it was Jang Dong-gun, Hyun Bin and me.

220
00:08:28.725 --> 00:08:31.072
(Embarrassed in a sauna.)

221
00:08:31.092 --> 00:08:34.170
I wasn't there but I can totally see it.

222
00:08:34.678 --> 00:08:35.678
The thing is...

223
00:08:35.788 --> 00:08:37.193
Hyun Bin played King Jungjo

224
00:08:37.194 --> 00:08:38.500
in The Fatal Encounter...

225
00:08:38.501 --> 00:08:41.043
Lee Seo-Jin played him in Lee San.

226
00:08:41.647 --> 00:08:44.560
All handsome actors play King Jungjo.

227
00:08:45.709 --> 00:08:48.452
King Jungjo in The Throne...

228
00:08:48.694 --> 00:08:51.259
Was played by So Ji-sub.

229
00:08:54.053 --> 00:08:55.584
Hwasung is big!

230
00:08:55.975 --> 00:08:59.319
(Total length of 5.7km.)

231
00:08:59.381 --> 00:09:01.202
Is this wall...

232
00:09:01.459 --> 00:09:03.170
The original wall?

233
00:09:03.202 --> 00:09:03.834
Yup.

234
00:09:03.897 --> 00:09:05.852
I'm sure it only had minor fixes.

235
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:08.061
That's why preservation is much more

236
00:09:08.561 --> 00:09:09.913
important than development.

237
00:09:10.053 --> 00:09:11.350
Preservation is...

238
00:09:11.475 --> 00:09:14.130
Preservation is much harder.

239
00:09:15.381 --> 00:09:17.569
The Royal Train carrying 4 spoons

240
00:09:18.147 --> 00:09:19.725
goes straight through the city

241
00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.443
following the foot steps and dreams

242
00:09:21.444 --> 00:09:22.444
of King Jungjo.

243
00:09:24.327 --> 00:09:25.872
(He wanted this castle to protect)

244
00:09:25.873 --> 00:09:27.207
(his father's grave)

245
00:09:27.248 --> 00:09:28.897
(and have people live inside happily.)

246
00:09:28.898 --> 00:09:31.155
(The King's march.)

247
00:09:31.319 --> 00:09:32.585
King Jungjo's dream

248
00:09:32.733 --> 00:09:34.850
has been protecting this city

249
00:09:34.897 --> 00:09:36.130
for more than 200 years.

250
00:09:36.405 --> 00:09:39.125
This whole town is historic and cultural.

251
00:09:39.428 --> 00:09:41.459
I've never looked at Suwon this carefully.

252
00:09:42.014 --> 00:09:43.014
Same here.

253
00:09:43.178 --> 00:09:45.094
My grandma lives in Suwon.

254
00:09:45.655 --> 00:09:47.560
I used to come here as a kid.

255
00:09:47.819 --> 00:09:49.399
But I didn't know it was this big.

256
00:09:49.475 --> 00:09:51.092
This street is named, King Jungjo Road.

257
00:09:51.913 --> 00:09:56.593
King Jungjo is every where in Suwon.

258
00:09:58.108 --> 00:10:00.481
He's the one who made the city.

259
00:10:01.725 --> 00:10:05.526
(The train is in the city center now.)

260
00:10:05.569 --> 00:10:07.700
Like in dramas,

261
00:10:07.701 --> 00:10:09.144
this road existed 200 years ago!

262
00:10:09.194 --> 00:10:10.720
I feel like a king!

263
00:10:11.866 --> 00:10:12.990
Are we here?

264
00:10:13.006 --> 00:10:14.006
Yup.

265
00:10:14.358 --> 00:10:15.487
But it was so nice.

266
00:10:16.319 --> 00:10:17.615
I want to get on it again.

267
00:10:17.616 --> 00:10:20.450
(Arrived at Paldalmun Bazaar.)

268
00:10:20.694 --> 00:10:21.694
200 years ago,

269
00:10:22.131 --> 00:10:23.990
King Jungjo wanted Suwon to become

270
00:10:23.991 --> 00:10:25.623
a hub of commerce.

271
00:10:27.038 --> 00:10:28.794
He opened this bazaar and called

272
00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:31.329
every famous merchants in the country.

273
00:10:34.553 --> 00:10:37.561
This bazaar made by a king

274
00:10:37.756 --> 00:10:40.694
is next to other 8 bazaars.

275
00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:44.732
As one of the biggest bazaars,

276
00:10:44.936 --> 00:10:46.708
it boasts a huge size and choices.

277
00:10:50.061 --> 00:10:51.061
Ho-dong.

278
00:10:51.366 --> 00:10:53.694
Sit over here and drink with King Jungjo.

279
00:10:53.803 --> 00:10:54.803
I can join him?

280
00:10:54.858 --> 00:10:56.192
Then take a picture.

281
00:10:56.756 --> 00:10:59.335
(Shows how it's done.)

282
00:10:59.631 --> 00:11:02.066
(Good day to drink.)

283
00:11:02.092 --> 00:11:04.759
King Jungjo and a king of variety shows!

284
00:11:06.256 --> 00:11:07.491
Do your job!

285
00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:11.156
(How dare you!)

286
00:11:11.694 --> 00:11:13.413
The records say that

287
00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:14.639
drinking with King Jungjo

288
00:11:14.678 --> 00:11:16.600
didn't end until one person passed out.

289
00:11:17.272 --> 00:11:18.615
Some people say drinking

290
00:11:18.616 --> 00:11:20.553
was his way of dealing with his stress.

291
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:23.622
(He died at 49 without seeing)

292
00:11:23.623 --> 00:11:25.279
(reforms he dreamed of.)

293
00:11:25.319 --> 00:11:26.785
Let me take a picture.

294
00:11:27.381 --> 00:11:29.194
That's a nice photo.

295
00:11:29.709 --> 00:11:31.691
One, two, three!

296
00:11:33.334 --> 00:11:35.602
The king of variety shows meets King Jungjo

297
00:11:35.655 --> 00:11:37.778
to share a drink.

298
00:11:38.991 --> 00:11:39.991
Kyung-kyu!

299
00:11:40.514 --> 00:11:42.264
Let's check out the bazaar!

300
00:11:42.881 --> 00:11:44.146
There are tons to do here!

301
00:11:44.147 --> 00:11:45.147
No!

302
00:11:45.178 --> 00:11:47.359
(Will they take 6 hours here too?)

303
00:11:48.295 --> 00:11:49.928
It's pretty big.

304
00:11:50.522 --> 00:11:52.631
This bazaar is open to all directions!

305
00:11:53.256 --> 00:11:54.505
I heard it's made of

306
00:11:54.506 --> 00:11:55.840
9 different bazaars.

307
00:11:56.123 --> 00:11:58.305
9 different bazaars?

308
00:12:01.616 --> 00:12:03.288
That's why it's so big!

309
00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:04.350
It's huge.

310
00:12:05.413 --> 00:12:07.741
(Someone comes up to Ho-dong.)

311
00:12:08.795 --> 00:12:10.195
You're really skinny!

312
00:12:11.866 --> 00:12:14.577
(Here he goes again...)

313
00:12:14.616 --> 00:12:15.905
Do you know who this is?

314
00:12:16.725 --> 00:12:17.725
Hi!

315
00:12:17.756 --> 00:12:18.756
She's a singer.

316
00:12:18.881 --> 00:12:20.607
What generation?

317
00:12:25.788 --> 00:12:28.024
Let's keep up with Kyung-kyu!

318
00:12:29.857 --> 00:12:30.947
Yu-ri!

319
00:12:31.913 --> 00:12:33.046
What do you want?

320
00:12:33.272 --> 00:12:35.184
(Annoyed.)

321
00:12:35.225 --> 00:12:36.552
If you could choose only one...

322
00:12:36.553 --> 00:12:37.698
Are you buying?

323
00:12:38.819 --> 00:12:41.209
Why are they wasting their time?

324
00:12:41.881 --> 00:12:43.365
They can't even eat and

325
00:12:43.366 --> 00:12:45.166
they're wasting their time.

326
00:12:46.475 --> 00:12:47.975
You think we'll be successful today?

327
00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:49.069
Today?

328
00:12:49.553 --> 00:12:50.553
To be honest...

329
00:12:50.897 --> 00:12:52.867
I'm really shy...

330
00:12:53.397 --> 00:12:57.031
Eating at a stranger's house...

331
00:12:57.709 --> 00:12:58.709
Worries me.

332
00:12:58.748 --> 00:13:00.366
I'll be worried whether we're

333
00:13:00.577 --> 00:13:02.803
both successful or not.

334
00:13:02.944 --> 00:13:03.944
It's okay.

335
00:13:04.006 --> 00:13:05.334
It might be awkward at first.

336
00:13:05.756 --> 00:13:07.163
But the other people will be too.

337
00:13:07.475 --> 00:13:08.874
It will be for both of you.

338
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:09.987
Not just for me?

339
00:13:10.795 --> 00:13:13.209
They'll be awkward when they open the door.

340
00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.747
But once you get to talking,

341
00:13:14.748 --> 00:13:15.833
you'll get close to them.

342
00:13:15.834 --> 00:13:16.834
Really?

343
00:13:17.038 --> 00:13:19.162
You wouldn't want to leave at the end.

344
00:13:19.202 --> 00:13:20.202
Really?

345
00:13:20.256 --> 00:13:21.256
Every time.

346
00:13:21.303 --> 00:13:24.112
Just see it for yourself.

347
00:13:24.147 --> 00:13:27.940
(He became a philosopher.)

348
00:13:29.077 --> 00:13:30.833
(Arrived at the bus stop.)

349
00:13:30.834 --> 00:13:32.788
We have to take the bus to Hwaseodong.

350
00:13:33.273 --> 00:13:35.794
(Still a transportation hub for Suwon)

351
00:13:35.795 --> 00:13:38.163
(even after 200 years.)

352
00:13:38.194 --> 00:13:39.366
Here's Paldalmun!

353
00:13:40.217 --> 00:13:43.209
(Needs to take Bus #3 to Hwaseodong.)

354
00:13:43.584 --> 00:13:46.187
(Finally arrived...)

355
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:48.040
It's here!

356
00:13:48.092 --> 00:13:49.529
The bus is here!

357
00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:50.530
Let's go.

358
00:13:50.881 --> 00:13:54.971
(On their way to Hwaseodong for a meal.)

359
00:13:57.655 --> 00:13:58.912
Hwaseodong gets its name

360
00:13:58.913 --> 00:14:00.217
from Hwasung's west gate.

361
00:14:00.545 --> 00:14:02.961
Will they be able to find a meal there?

362
00:14:08.491 --> 00:14:11.717
(They arrived at Hwaseodong.)

363
00:14:12.506 --> 00:14:15.788
(How does Hwaseodong look like?)

364
00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.483
Let's go to where houses are.

365
00:14:17.522 --> 00:14:18.522
Okay!

366
00:14:18.553 --> 00:14:19.553
Kyung-kyu!

367
00:14:19.741 --> 00:14:20.741
Smell...

368
00:14:22.897 --> 00:14:24.913
Even their sign looks delicious...

369
00:14:25.366 --> 00:14:27.498
I can smell the charcoals!

370
00:14:27.499 --> 00:14:28.499
(Galbi on charcoals.)

371
00:14:29.397 --> 00:14:30.397
Wait.

372
00:14:31.444 --> 00:14:34.896
Why is Suwon famous for galbi?

373
00:14:35.694 --> 00:14:38.748
There are a lot of theories...

374
00:14:40.327 --> 00:14:42.466
One theory says that killing cows

375
00:14:42.467 --> 00:14:43.601
were only allowed in Suwon

376
00:14:43.655 --> 00:14:46.052
to meet the nutritious needs

377
00:14:46.108 --> 00:14:48.498
for workers who built the city.

378
00:14:49.692 --> 00:14:52.262
Another suggests that it's famous because

379
00:14:52.263 --> 00:14:54.529
one of Korea's biggest beef market

380
00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:56.013
is in Suwon.

381
00:14:56.763 --> 00:14:58.380
How can there be a Korean BBQ restaurant

382
00:14:58.411 --> 00:15:00.011
right on the entrance?

383
00:15:00.036 --> 00:15:02.631
(I know.)

384
00:15:02.786 --> 00:15:04.708
I wish we can eat some galbi today.

385
00:15:05.973 --> 00:15:07.285
Apartments, condos and houses

386
00:15:07.286 --> 00:15:08.553
are all mixed here.

387
00:15:08.919 --> 00:15:11.716
But most of them are houses.

388
00:15:12.419 --> 00:15:13.822
Houses, condos...

389
00:15:14.442 --> 00:15:19.043
(Which one would they go into today?)

390
00:15:19.044 --> 00:15:20.606
Look at those persimmons.

391
00:15:21.442 --> 00:15:22.535
I see!

392
00:15:22.645 --> 00:15:26.293
(They'll ripe very soon...)

393
00:15:26.395 --> 00:15:28.286
Sunny, did you ever live in a house?

394
00:15:28.317 --> 00:15:30.066
I used to live in a house.

395
00:15:30.067 --> 00:15:32.136
We had a persimmon tree like that too.

396
00:15:32.137 --> 00:15:33.372
It brings me back memories!

397
00:15:33.622 --> 00:15:36.380
I think my family was closer

398
00:15:36.677 --> 00:15:38.463
when we lived in a house

399
00:15:38.872 --> 00:15:40.348
to our neighbors.

400
00:15:40.419 --> 00:15:42.330
Dates tree.

401
00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:45.838
(From a tree full of dates...)

402
00:15:46.091 --> 00:15:48.016
They're all peppers.

403
00:15:48.263 --> 00:15:50.443
Everyone grows something here.

404
00:15:50.444 --> 00:15:52.801
(A lot of fruits and vegetables)

405
00:15:52.802 --> 00:15:54.462
(growing in this city...)

406
00:15:57.184 --> 00:15:58.442
Will Girls' Generation...

407
00:16:00.427 --> 00:16:01.427
Last forever?

408
00:16:02.184 --> 00:16:03.184
What?

409
00:16:03.192 --> 00:16:04.604
What are you talking about?

410
00:16:04.638 --> 00:16:06.356
This is their 10th year.

411
00:16:06.411 --> 00:16:07.411
No one knows.

412
00:16:08.208 --> 00:16:09.928
Will it be Mothers' Generation later?

413
00:16:10.419 --> 00:16:11.933
We'll still be Girls' Generation

414
00:16:11.934 --> 00:16:13.548
even when we're mothers.

415
00:16:13.942 --> 00:16:15.287
Girls' Generation is forever.

416
00:16:15.505 --> 00:16:17.036
You think you can do it for 20 years?

417
00:16:17.458 --> 00:16:19.035
We didn't think we can do 10

418
00:16:19.036 --> 00:16:21.177
at first either.

419
00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:22.705
Because you hated each other?

420
00:16:23.622 --> 00:16:24.811
You almost got me to say yes!

421
00:16:25.973 --> 00:16:27.683
Not a lot of idols lasted 5 years

422
00:16:27.684 --> 00:16:29.446
back in our days.

423
00:16:29.911 --> 00:16:33.025
They say 7th year is crucial these days.

424
00:16:33.026 --> 00:16:34.297
It was 5 back then.

425
00:16:34.427 --> 00:16:36.245
History is always written again.

426
00:16:36.567 --> 00:16:38.738
Every step you take now is a history.

427
00:16:38.739 --> 00:16:39.739
I guess so.

428
00:16:40.036 --> 00:16:41.934
11th year, 15th year...

429
00:16:42.372 --> 00:16:44.039
I think that's why I feel

430
00:16:44.239 --> 00:16:46.233
more pressured these days...

431
00:16:47.177 --> 00:16:48.669
I can't just blurt things out.

432
00:16:48.739 --> 00:16:49.739
Really?

433
00:16:49.794 --> 00:16:50.794
Solar panels!

434
00:16:52.145 --> 00:16:53.412
That's a good idea.

435
00:16:54.411 --> 00:16:55.878
Something is connected

436
00:16:55.989 --> 00:16:57.322
to that solar panel.

437
00:16:57.723 --> 00:16:58.723
That's cool.

438
00:17:00.005 --> 00:17:01.426
Everyone has solar panels!

439
00:17:01.427 --> 00:17:02.637
That house has one too!

440
00:17:02.669 --> 00:17:04.395
(Another solar panels!)

441
00:17:04.442 --> 00:17:06.867
Are they for doorbells'...

442
00:17:07.442 --> 00:17:09.067
Power?

443
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.740
Just doorbells?

444
00:17:10.895 --> 00:17:12.574
I'm sure there's more...

445
00:17:12.691 --> 00:17:13.848
Excuse me miss!

446
00:17:14.269 --> 00:17:16.085
Those solar panels...

447
00:17:16.323 --> 00:17:18.399
What are they for?

448
00:17:19.854 --> 00:17:21.342
For the lights!

449
00:17:23.698 --> 00:17:25.576
The address plaque lights up?

450
00:17:26.855 --> 00:17:28.230
That's cool!

451
00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.783
For the lights!

452
00:17:29.784 --> 00:17:31.408
(Used to light up the address plaques)

453
00:17:31.409 --> 00:17:32.736
(at night.)

454
00:17:32.784 --> 00:17:33.784
Thank you!

455
00:17:34.019 --> 00:17:35.019
Thank you!

456
00:17:35.058 --> 00:17:37.031
(Good luck!)

457
00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:42.345
There aren't a lot of people here...

458
00:17:42.933 --> 00:17:44.285
It's vacation season.

459
00:17:45.073 --> 00:17:46.628
That could be our disadvantage.

460
00:17:46.964 --> 00:17:48.933
I think I can do a good job

461
00:17:49.136 --> 00:17:51.423
if I can talk to someone

462
00:17:51.691 --> 00:17:53.198
face to face.

463
00:17:53.511 --> 00:17:55.391
But talking into a speaker

464
00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.075
seems really awkward.

465
00:17:59.128 --> 00:18:00.128
Hello.

466
00:18:00.777 --> 00:18:02.573
I'm Yu-ri from Girls' Generation.

467
00:18:03.128 --> 00:18:05.956
(What is she doing?)

468
00:18:06.261 --> 00:18:07.823
Did you eat yet?

469
00:18:08.855 --> 00:18:10.793
(Do it again...)

470
00:18:10.839 --> 00:18:11.906
Did you eat yet?

471
00:18:12.831 --> 00:18:15.182
(Already?)

472
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:16.527
Are you doing it already?

473
00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:18.820
Did you start already?

474
00:18:20.745 --> 00:18:22.079
She started already?

475
00:18:22.722 --> 00:18:24.486
(She's a good actor.)

476
00:18:24.511 --> 00:18:25.578
I'll be waiting!

477
00:18:25.823 --> 00:18:26.823
Practice.

478
00:18:28.167 --> 00:18:29.374
I thought I heard someone!

479
00:18:29.456 --> 00:18:30.456
Practice!

480
00:18:30.589 --> 00:18:32.147
No one answered?

481
00:18:32.691 --> 00:18:34.014
I heard something!

482
00:18:34.214 --> 00:18:36.183
Inside voices.

483
00:18:36.355 --> 00:18:39.167
I must be hearing things!

484
00:18:39.863 --> 00:18:42.433
(Time to talk strategies.)

485
00:18:42.605 --> 00:18:43.658
Double Kyu!

486
00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:44.730
What's that?

487
00:18:45.558 --> 00:18:46.963
Sun-kyu and Kyung-kyu!

488
00:18:46.964 --> 00:18:47.964
Double Kyu!

489
00:18:48.081 --> 00:18:50.446
But that sounds so weird!

490
00:18:50.644 --> 00:18:52.276
You're both too violent.

491
00:18:52.323 --> 00:18:53.323
What?

492
00:18:53.777 --> 00:18:54.910
Sunny, come here.

493
00:18:55.534 --> 00:18:58.573
(Ho-dong and Yu-ri are in a team.)

494
00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.772
In Hwaseodong with Girls' Generation.

495
00:19:01.402 --> 00:19:03.134
Let's not have them regret their 10 years.

496
00:19:05.042 --> 00:19:06.042
Kyung-kyu!

497
00:19:06.066 --> 00:19:07.279
Let's make it worthwhile!

498
00:19:07.714 --> 00:19:10.591
Let's Have Dinner Together!

499
00:19:11.519 --> 00:19:15.534
Time to dream about a meal in Hwaseodong.

500
00:19:15.605 --> 00:19:16.805
Let's get started.

501
00:19:18.948 --> 00:19:20.003
Are we starting?

502
00:19:20.995 --> 00:19:22.642
They really do pick any houses.

503
00:19:22.714 --> 00:19:23.753
Are we starting?

504
00:19:23.792 --> 00:19:24.792
Yup.

505
00:19:24.816 --> 00:19:25.949
Sunny, go for it.

506
00:19:26.417 --> 00:19:27.605
This is our first attempt!

507
00:19:28.386 --> 00:19:30.311
It's only our first house...

508
00:19:30.792 --> 00:19:33.718
It's a practice.

509
00:19:34.097 --> 00:19:36.231
But, we're rewriting history today!

510
00:19:37.245 --> 00:19:40.135
(Sunny's first attempt!)

511
00:19:40.136 --> 00:19:42.774
(But...)

512
00:19:42.948 --> 00:19:44.412
It's broken.

513
00:19:49.058 --> 00:19:50.167
That was anticlimactic.

514
00:19:51.643 --> 00:19:53.182
(Sunny's first attempt fails.)

515
00:19:53.183 --> 00:19:54.183
Did we fail?

516
00:19:54.441 --> 00:19:55.760
Is it my turn now?

517
00:19:56.706 --> 00:19:57.773
The door's open!

518
00:19:57.855 --> 00:20:00.382
(Can Yu-ri rewrite history in Suwon?)

519
00:20:00.519 --> 00:20:02.878
(Yu-ri's first attempt!)

520
00:20:05.277 --> 00:20:07.617
(Will she fail too?)

521
00:20:08.339 --> 00:20:09.339
Who is it?

522
00:20:10.277 --> 00:20:11.496
Hi!

523
00:20:12.433 --> 00:20:15.638
I'm Yu-ri from Girls' Generation!

524
00:20:17.269 --> 00:20:18.425
Someone's coming out!

525
00:20:18.449 --> 00:20:20.097
The noise is coming from up there!

526
00:20:20.144 --> 00:20:21.345
Give me a minute!

527
00:20:21.558 --> 00:20:23.439
Should we hide over there?

528
00:20:24.253 --> 00:20:26.453
(Camouflaged?)

529
00:20:26.527 --> 00:20:28.397
His voice sounded really nice!

530
00:20:28.894 --> 00:20:30.003
I hope you're successful.

531
00:20:30.058 --> 00:20:31.058
I will.

532
00:20:32.058 --> 00:20:33.058
He's here!

533
00:20:34.261 --> 00:20:35.699
Hi!

534
00:20:35.933 --> 00:20:38.351
I'm Yu-ri from Girls' Generation.

535
00:20:38.371 --> 00:20:39.371
Do you know me?

536
00:20:39.402 --> 00:20:40.402
Yup.

537
00:20:40.433 --> 00:20:42.935
(Great start!)

538
00:20:43.043 --> 00:20:44.791
Did you eat dinner yet?

539
00:20:45.058 --> 00:20:46.058
Not yet.

540
00:20:46.097 --> 00:20:47.269
I see...

541
00:20:47.472 --> 00:20:50.057
I even have my own spoon with me!

542
00:20:51.136 --> 00:20:52.441
If it's okay...

543
00:20:52.488 --> 00:20:55.982
(Sounds very convincing so far.)

544
00:20:56.253 --> 00:20:57.587
Is your family home?

545
00:20:57.707 --> 00:20:59.319
My wife is home!

546
00:21:00.019 --> 00:21:03.281
What do you think about...

547
00:21:03.582 --> 00:21:05.511
All of us talking...

548
00:21:06.043 --> 00:21:09.648
And having a meal together?

549
00:21:09.746 --> 00:21:11.154
Let me go ask my wife.

550
00:21:11.808 --> 00:21:13.019
I think she's got it!

551
00:21:13.339 --> 00:21:16.032
(Success on first attempt is close!)

552
00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:17.306
I think we got it!

553
00:21:17.746 --> 00:21:20.147
He looks really nice.

554
00:21:20.597 --> 00:21:21.997
Should we go upstairs

555
00:21:22.035 --> 00:21:24.019
after you're successful on the 1st floor?

556
00:21:24.191 --> 00:21:25.899
Should we eat in the same house?

557
00:21:26.105 --> 00:21:27.324
Hi!

558
00:21:27.418 --> 00:21:29.332
We're from a TV program.

559
00:21:29.457 --> 00:21:31.487
It's called Let's Have Dinner Together

560
00:21:31.488 --> 00:21:32.593
from JTBC.

561
00:21:32.636 --> 00:21:33.636
I know.

562
00:21:33.793 --> 00:21:35.621
It'll be just me and Yu-ri.

563
00:21:36.027 --> 00:21:37.027
If it's okay...

564
00:21:37.464 --> 00:21:39.274
Would you like to eat with us?

565
00:21:40.543 --> 00:21:43.777
(Will Yu-ri be successful?)

566
00:21:43.855 --> 00:21:45.969
My wife said no...

567
00:21:47.605 --> 00:21:49.983
(Oh my god.)

568
00:21:50.074 --> 00:21:52.691
(Yu-ri's first attempt failed!)

569
00:21:53.011 --> 00:21:54.670
Thank you for talking to us on Sunday

570
00:21:54.714 --> 00:21:56.335
while getting a rest.

571
00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.305
(Huge smiles.)

572
00:21:58.306 --> 00:22:00.418
Thank you for recognizing me.

573
00:22:00.621 --> 00:22:02.256
Good luck in this hot weather.

574
00:22:02.293 --> 00:22:04.915
We thought we'd be successful.

575
00:22:06.793 --> 00:22:09.854
It would've been nice to eat with you.

576
00:22:09.855 --> 00:22:11.089
(He's happy they didn't.)

577
00:22:11.105 --> 00:22:12.495
Why are you so happy?

578
00:22:12.496 --> 00:22:14.463
Then good luck in everything...

579
00:22:14.793 --> 00:22:16.096
Be careful in this heat...

580
00:22:16.808 --> 00:22:18.506
Enjoy your dinner.

581
00:22:18.507 --> 00:22:19.507
Thank you.

582
00:22:22.503 --> 00:22:24.417
It's pretty easy!

583
00:22:24.472 --> 00:22:25.542
I thought it'd work...

584
00:22:25.543 --> 00:22:27.341
I thought so too!

585
00:22:27.949 --> 00:22:30.151
A spousal agreement is a must

586
00:22:30.152 --> 00:22:31.152
to have a meal.

587
00:22:33.027 --> 00:22:34.027
It's summer.

588
00:22:34.777 --> 00:22:37.305
Inviting guests in isn't easy.

589
00:22:37.855 --> 00:22:38.855
Sunny!

590
00:22:40.043 --> 00:22:41.768
We can tell if someone's home

591
00:22:41.769 --> 00:22:44.535
by looking at the air conditioner.

592
00:22:46.214 --> 00:22:48.386
(No sound again...)

593
00:22:50.519 --> 00:22:52.841
(Rings one more time.)

594
00:22:52.871 --> 00:22:53.871
Who is it?

595
00:22:54.339 --> 00:22:55.339
Hi!

596
00:22:55.402 --> 00:22:57.440
I'm Sunny from Girls' Generation!

597
00:22:57.511 --> 00:22:58.511
Okay.

598
00:22:59.636 --> 00:23:01.790
Do you know who I am?

599
00:23:03.035 --> 00:23:05.034
Not really...

600
00:23:05.097 --> 00:23:06.121
I see...

601
00:23:06.168 --> 00:23:09.134
Are you from JTBC?

602
00:23:09.933 --> 00:23:10.933
That's right!

603
00:23:11.043 --> 00:23:13.940
I saw you guys earlier.

604
00:23:13.941 --> 00:23:14.941
Really?

605
00:23:15.871 --> 00:23:17.402
Would you like to...

606
00:23:17.894 --> 00:23:22.679
Join a program you normally enjoy...

607
00:23:23.214 --> 00:23:25.261
(Very smooth.)

608
00:23:25.777 --> 00:23:27.824
And have a chance

609
00:23:28.472 --> 00:23:31.148
to talk about all kinds of things?

610
00:23:31.293 --> 00:23:32.293
Sure!

611
00:23:35.793 --> 00:23:37.432
Thank you!

612
00:23:38.175 --> 00:23:40.209
You have to ask her if she ate!

613
00:23:40.355 --> 00:23:42.916
(We don't know if she ate yet...)

614
00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.495
Some people still want to offer meals

615
00:23:45.496 --> 00:23:46.496
when they ate.

616
00:23:46.824 --> 00:23:48.297
That's our most important rule.

617
00:23:48.418 --> 00:23:49.418
Yes?

618
00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:53.150
I forgot to ask you a question.

619
00:23:53.683 --> 00:23:55.739
Did you eat yet?

620
00:23:57.285 --> 00:23:58.285
Dinner?

621
00:23:58.449 --> 00:24:01.512
We barely ate.

622
00:24:02.214 --> 00:24:04.745
(No way...)

623
00:24:06.918 --> 00:24:08.893
(The car got angry!)

624
00:24:08.918 --> 00:24:11.043
(Chaos.)

625
00:24:12.714 --> 00:24:13.714
I'm sorry!

626
00:24:13.761 --> 00:24:14.988
That wasn't me!

627
00:24:15.042 --> 00:24:17.006
Don't get the wrong idea!

628
00:24:17.113 --> 00:24:18.113
Hello?

629
00:24:19.074 --> 00:24:20.261
I'm Lee Kyung-kyu!

630
00:24:20.339 --> 00:24:21.339
Hi!

631
00:24:22.667 --> 00:24:24.538
What did you mean by barely ate?

632
00:24:25.652 --> 00:24:27.158
We just had bean stew...

633
00:24:27.159 --> 00:24:28.706
So you already ate...

634
00:24:31.081 --> 00:24:32.994
(The car started.)

635
00:24:33.019 --> 00:24:34.019
If you ate already,

636
00:24:34.324 --> 00:24:36.103
we can't go in!

637
00:24:37.847 --> 00:24:39.550
Thank you!

638
00:24:41.074 --> 00:24:42.417
There's no one in there!

639
00:24:42.995 --> 00:24:43.995
What's going on?

640
00:24:44.093 --> 00:24:47.430
Some cars can be started by their keys.

641
00:24:47.777 --> 00:24:48.857
There she is!

642
00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:50.925
Sorry to bother you!

643
00:24:52.605 --> 00:24:55.941
(Yu-ri's attempt.)

644
00:24:55.964 --> 00:24:57.097
Whose turn is it?

645
00:24:57.136 --> 00:24:58.136
Yu-ri.

646
00:24:58.855 --> 00:25:00.517
That's a nice noise!

647
00:25:06.472 --> 00:25:08.895
(Someone picked up!)

648
00:25:08.941 --> 00:25:10.783
Hi, I'm Yu-ri from Girls' Generation.

649
00:25:10.886 --> 00:25:12.086
Girls' Generation?

650
00:25:12.152 --> 00:25:13.152
Hi!

651
00:25:13.191 --> 00:25:14.191
Wow!

652
00:25:15.839 --> 00:25:17.743
Who's your favorite?

653
00:25:18.519 --> 00:25:19.519
Yu-ri!

654
00:25:20.315 --> 00:25:22.331
(Hopeful.)

655
00:25:23.691 --> 00:25:25.480
You're my boss' niece.

656
00:25:25.527 --> 00:25:26.527
What?

657
00:25:26.558 --> 00:25:27.964
You're my boss' niece.

658
00:25:28.034 --> 00:25:29.347
Your boss?

659
00:25:29.409 --> 00:25:30.409
Mr. Cha...

660
00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:31.480
That's right!

661
00:25:31.738 --> 00:25:33.586
I'm sorry but my house is too dirty...

662
00:25:33.644 --> 00:25:34.644
That's fine!

663
00:25:34.699 --> 00:25:36.120
How do you know her?

664
00:25:36.206 --> 00:25:38.858
How do you know my uncle again?

665
00:25:38.902 --> 00:25:39.902
I work for him!

666
00:25:41.074 --> 00:25:42.729
She works for my uncle!

667
00:25:42.824 --> 00:25:43.824
Wow!

668
00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:47.193
That's so awesome!

669
00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:51.119
Out of everyone in this world,

670
00:25:51.167 --> 00:25:52.397
you and I met today!

671
00:25:52.433 --> 00:25:53.949
That's so cool.

672
00:25:54.214 --> 00:25:55.511
Ask her to come down.

673
00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:57.228
Let's talk face to face.

674
00:25:57.636 --> 00:26:01.141
Why don't you come down?

675
00:26:01.214 --> 00:26:02.481
Let me get dressed.

676
00:26:02.542 --> 00:26:03.542
Okay!

677
00:26:03.824 --> 00:26:05.774
That's so cool!

678
00:26:06.261 --> 00:26:07.471
I know!

679
00:26:07.472 --> 00:26:08.994
The world is so tiny!

680
00:26:08.995 --> 00:26:09.995
Sunny.

681
00:26:10.089 --> 00:26:12.799
What does your uncle do?

682
00:26:13.386 --> 00:26:14.386
Nothing much...

683
00:26:15.761 --> 00:26:17.284
How awesome.

684
00:26:17.761 --> 00:26:19.612
My uncle owns a company...

685
00:26:20.284 --> 00:26:21.351
It's pretty big.

686
00:26:21.378 --> 00:26:23.682
I'm her uncle's employee.

687
00:26:23.722 --> 00:26:24.722
Me too!

688
00:26:24.886 --> 00:26:26.338
(Who's her uncle?)

689
00:26:26.339 --> 00:26:27.339
Lee Soo-man.

690
00:26:27.355 --> 00:26:28.355
Soo-man?

691
00:26:28.831 --> 00:26:30.324
He's your uncle?

692
00:26:31.691 --> 00:26:34.727
(Everyone here is his employee.)

693
00:26:34.956 --> 00:26:36.278
Sorry Soo-man.

694
00:26:36.683 --> 00:26:39.269
(She has some connections.)

695
00:26:39.284 --> 00:26:42.130
(Kyung-kyu's question backfired.)

696
00:26:43.042 --> 00:26:44.449
I don't think she's coming.

697
00:26:44.886 --> 00:26:46.531
Should I call my uncle?

698
00:26:46.878 --> 00:26:48.012
And ask him to...

699
00:26:48.214 --> 00:26:49.214
Don't.

700
00:26:49.347 --> 00:26:51.292
Don't put him in that position!

701
00:26:52.464 --> 00:26:54.698
I was just gonna say it was nice

702
00:26:54.699 --> 00:26:55.699
to meet her!

703
00:26:56.417 --> 00:26:58.315
But today's Sunday...

704
00:26:58.316 --> 00:26:59.931
She could get wrong ideas.

705
00:27:00.011 --> 00:27:01.154
You're right.

706
00:27:01.941 --> 00:27:03.557
She's here!

707
00:27:04.402 --> 00:27:05.402
Hi!

708
00:27:05.511 --> 00:27:07.109
I knew she'd wear a mask!

709
00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:09.185
Isn't that what celebrities do in airports?

710
00:27:09.308 --> 00:27:10.870
Hi!

711
00:27:11.167 --> 00:27:13.459
You look like a celebrity at the airport.

712
00:27:14.745 --> 00:27:16.347
Why don't you eat together?

713
00:27:17.027 --> 00:27:18.360
Is your house dirty?

714
00:27:20.128 --> 00:27:21.595
Let me take a photo of you two.

715
00:27:22.261 --> 00:27:24.047
I'll get the address in there too.

716
00:27:24.183 --> 00:27:25.534
You can't even see her!

717
00:27:26.683 --> 00:27:29.364
(Huh...?)

718
00:27:29.667 --> 00:27:31.292
She doesn't look at a camera either.

719
00:27:31.527 --> 00:27:32.527
Look.

720
00:27:32.995 --> 00:27:34.425
She's not looking at the camera!

721
00:27:35.324 --> 00:27:36.909
What was the point of this?

722
00:27:37.386 --> 00:27:39.572
(No one will recognize who that is.)

723
00:27:39.667 --> 00:27:41.245
It was nice seeing you!

724
00:27:41.652 --> 00:27:43.472
How about that house?

725
00:27:45.292 --> 00:27:48.242
(Confidently walks up to the next house.)

726
00:27:52.144 --> 00:27:53.144
Who is it?

727
00:27:53.722 --> 00:27:55.219
Hi!

728
00:27:55.995 --> 00:27:58.489
I'm Sunny from Girls' Generation.

729
00:27:59.175 --> 00:28:00.878
Do you know who I am?

730
00:28:01.019 --> 00:28:02.019
Yes!

731
00:28:02.057 --> 00:28:03.058
Really?

732
00:28:04.355 --> 00:28:07.501
(She opened her front gate.)

733
00:28:08.534 --> 00:28:11.480
I went to watch you guys shoot.

734
00:28:11.784 --> 00:28:12.893
I've been waiting...

735
00:28:13.417 --> 00:28:15.519
But we just ate.

736
00:28:17.644 --> 00:28:19.390
You should've waited a bit longer!

737
00:28:19.449 --> 00:28:20.800
That sucks...

738
00:28:21.074 --> 00:28:22.074
She just ate.

739
00:28:22.191 --> 00:28:23.771
(As soon as Sunny failed,)

740
00:28:23.772 --> 00:28:27.133
(Yu-ri goes to the next house.)

741
00:28:27.261 --> 00:28:29.533
(Nervous.)

742
00:28:30.386 --> 00:28:31.386
No one's picking up...

743
00:28:31.433 --> 00:28:33.179
Are you normally a lucky person?

744
00:28:33.589 --> 00:28:34.589
Yes?

745
00:28:34.831 --> 00:28:36.516
Hi!

746
00:28:36.581 --> 00:28:38.317
I'm Yu-ri from Girls' Generation.

747
00:28:38.433 --> 00:28:39.479
What?

748
00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.569
I'm Yu-ri from Girls' Generation.

749
00:28:42.128 --> 00:28:43.644
Hi.

750
00:28:43.855 --> 00:28:45.098
I'm a singer.

751
00:28:45.534 --> 00:28:48.769
Do you know who I am?

752
00:28:49.558 --> 00:28:50.629
Not really?

753
00:28:50.706 --> 00:28:52.003
Sing her a song!

754
00:28:53.683 --> 00:28:55.182
Girls' Generation!

755
00:28:55.503 --> 00:28:57.214
She's Yu-ri!

756
00:28:57.683 --> 00:28:59.300
I'm Kang Ho-dong!

757
00:28:59.925 --> 00:29:03.198
We're doing a TV show for JTBC.

758
00:29:03.402 --> 00:29:04.917
Is this Let's Have Dinner Together?

759
00:29:05.027 --> 00:29:06.586
You're absolutely right!

760
00:29:07.324 --> 00:29:09.707
Don't feel pressure to talk on TV.

761
00:29:09.753 --> 00:29:11.153
You can take it easy.

762
00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:13.726
You can talk about whatever you want.

763
00:29:14.574 --> 00:29:17.396
Did you eat dinner yet?

764
00:29:18.042 --> 00:29:19.042
Well...

765
00:29:19.761 --> 00:29:21.511
My husband isn't home...

766
00:29:21.691 --> 00:29:23.378
I'm alone right now.

767
00:29:24.042 --> 00:29:25.933
I didn't eat dinner yet...

768
00:29:26.042 --> 00:29:27.655
You didn't eat yet?

769
00:29:28.855 --> 00:29:31.721
But I'm dying my hair right now!

770
00:29:32.792 --> 00:29:35.373
We can help you!

771
00:29:35.558 --> 00:29:37.965
I'm doing it right now!

772
00:29:38.238 --> 00:29:41.605
Yu-ri said she can help you!

773
00:29:41.761 --> 00:29:42.854
Yu-ri's really good!

774
00:29:42.855 --> 00:29:44.818
I'll even wash your hair!

775
00:29:45.519 --> 00:29:47.261
I'll wash your hair!

776
00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.331
That's not the problem...

777
00:29:49.355 --> 00:29:51.480
If you came just 30 minutes earlier,

778
00:29:51.574 --> 00:29:54.587
I would've given you everything I had...

779
00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.369
I can't eat with you because

780
00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:57.939
I'm dying my hair!

781
00:29:58.058 --> 00:29:59.791
I hope we can see you next time

782
00:29:59.792 --> 00:30:01.152
we have a chance then!

783
00:30:01.292 --> 00:30:02.651
Thank you. I'm sorry!

784
00:30:02.902 --> 00:30:04.899
Thanks!

785
00:30:05.839 --> 00:30:07.886
Have a nice weekend!

786
00:30:10.214 --> 00:30:11.944
(Dying her hair.)

787
00:30:12.096 --> 00:30:14.167
It's really okay!

788
00:30:14.394 --> 00:30:16.605
(Disappointed...)

789
00:30:16.675 --> 00:30:19.195
Just do it!

790
00:30:19.589 --> 00:30:21.150
Eat with them!

791
00:30:21.238 --> 00:30:23.193
I was waiting but I just ate!

792
00:30:23.816 --> 00:30:26.163
(But, I'm dying my hair!)

793
00:30:27.691 --> 00:30:28.691
Bye!

794
00:30:28.792 --> 00:30:30.921
That was amazing.

795
00:30:31.105 --> 00:30:33.620
The whole street was united just now.

796
00:30:34.238 --> 00:30:35.627
(Goes to their next target.)

797
00:30:35.628 --> 00:30:37.339
I have a good feeling about this house.

798
00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:39.979
This doorbell is so high up!

799
00:30:42.167 --> 00:30:43.316
Who is it?

800
00:30:43.378 --> 00:30:44.995
Hi!

801
00:30:45.284 --> 00:30:46.902
(Someone picked up again!)

802
00:30:47.097 --> 00:30:49.450
Hi, I'm Sunny from Girls' Generation.

803
00:30:49.792 --> 00:30:50.792
Really?

804
00:30:50.855 --> 00:30:51.855
Yes!

805
00:30:53.003 --> 00:30:54.191
Oh my god!

806
00:30:54.917 --> 00:30:56.978
Ask her if what song she knows.

807
00:30:57.417 --> 00:30:59.798
(We'll take care of it.)

808
00:31:01.777 --> 00:31:03.253
If it's okay...

809
00:31:04.269 --> 00:31:05.613
Would you like to...

810
00:31:06.261 --> 00:31:08.902
Have dinner with me?

811
00:31:09.441 --> 00:31:11.400
I was actually looking forward to it...

812
00:31:11.964 --> 00:31:13.473
But I just ate...

813
00:31:15.831 --> 00:31:17.163
You ate already?

814
00:31:17.222 --> 00:31:18.860
I just ate!

815
00:31:20.339 --> 00:31:23.173
(Terrible timing!)

816
00:31:24.511 --> 00:31:28.254
Well, it was nice seeing you anyways!

817
00:31:29.074 --> 00:31:31.114
Thank you!

818
00:31:34.566 --> 00:31:36.555
Dying hair and early meals...

819
00:31:37.089 --> 00:31:38.737
Their dreams of having a meal

820
00:31:38.738 --> 00:31:40.800
on a holiday is not looking good.

821
00:31:42.089 --> 00:31:44.533
(Yu-ri's turn.)

822
00:31:48.034 --> 00:31:50.138
(In position.)

823
00:31:50.206 --> 00:31:51.206
Who is it?

824
00:31:51.292 --> 00:31:52.905
Hello!

825
00:31:53.855 --> 00:31:54.855
Wait!

826
00:31:55.113 --> 00:31:56.113
What?

827
00:31:56.175 --> 00:31:57.175
I'm...

828
00:31:58.378 --> 00:31:59.378
Wait!

829
00:32:02.355 --> 00:32:04.863
(What's going on?)

830
00:32:05.292 --> 00:32:06.292
Who is it?

831
00:32:06.464 --> 00:32:07.972
Hello!

832
00:32:08.886 --> 00:32:09.886
Wait!

833
00:32:09.956 --> 00:32:10.956
What?

834
00:32:11.027 --> 00:32:12.027
I'm...

835
00:32:13.199 --> 00:32:14.199
Wait!

836
00:32:22.058 --> 00:32:24.560
I thought she saw Yu-ri as a ghost!

837
00:32:24.816 --> 00:32:27.538
(Loudest reaction yet.)

838
00:32:27.769 --> 00:32:28.769
Hello?

839
00:32:28.816 --> 00:32:29.816
Yes!

840
00:32:30.167 --> 00:32:31.549
(Sounds nervous.)

841
00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:33.727
I'm Yu-ri from Girls' Generation!

842
00:32:34.441 --> 00:32:35.441
I know!

843
00:32:36.128 --> 00:32:37.938
Nice to meet you.

844
00:32:38.831 --> 00:32:40.511
Please calm down.

845
00:32:41.394 --> 00:32:43.643
Did you calm down?

846
00:32:43.949 --> 00:32:44.949
Yes...

847
00:32:45.199 --> 00:32:49.088
Did you eat dinner yet?

848
00:32:49.277 --> 00:32:50.277
No...

849
00:32:50.472 --> 00:32:51.995
(Nice timing!)

850
00:32:52.034 --> 00:32:53.409
Your voice suggests...

851
00:32:54.581 --> 00:32:55.715
You're a student?

852
00:32:55.769 --> 00:32:56.769
Yes...

853
00:32:56.816 --> 00:32:57.840
College or high school?

854
00:32:57.886 --> 00:32:58.886
College.

855
00:32:59.417 --> 00:33:01.354
Who do you live with?

856
00:33:01.769 --> 00:33:03.784
I live with my family.

857
00:33:04.081 --> 00:33:06.343
Are you with your parents now?

858
00:33:06.667 --> 00:33:09.995
They're grocery shopping right now.

859
00:33:10.113 --> 00:33:12.846
They went to a grocery store for dinner?

860
00:33:12.988 --> 00:33:15.121
(Automatically kneels down.)

861
00:33:15.245 --> 00:33:16.245
Then...

862
00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.837
Hey!

863
00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:20.253
We'll wait out here.

864
00:33:20.378 --> 00:33:22.229
This isn't something you can decide

865
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:23.628
on your own.

866
00:33:23.644 --> 00:33:25.502
Call your parents and ask

867
00:33:25.503 --> 00:33:28.503
if Let's Have Dinner Together can join you!

868
00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:29.550
Okay!

869
00:33:31.378 --> 00:33:34.162
(All they need is her parents' permission.)

870
00:33:35.206 --> 00:33:36.206
I think...

871
00:33:36.238 --> 00:33:37.238
It's 50-50.

872
00:33:37.363 --> 00:33:38.816
No!

873
00:33:39.097 --> 00:33:40.097
I'm sorry!

874
00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:41.120
I can't!

875
00:33:43.066 --> 00:33:44.876
My mom said no!

876
00:33:45.042 --> 00:33:46.837
(Great acting performance.)

877
00:33:47.222 --> 00:33:48.222
I want to.

878
00:33:48.238 --> 00:33:49.538
But mom says no!

879
00:33:49.675 --> 00:33:51.575
(The most intense rejection ever.)

880
00:33:51.576 --> 00:33:53.225
My mom said no!

881
00:33:53.339 --> 00:33:55.777
But things are looking up!

882
00:33:55.831 --> 00:33:57.545
I think she's a big fan!

883
00:33:57.683 --> 00:33:59.170
Her parents are grocery shopping

884
00:33:59.425 --> 00:34:02.252
and she really wants this to happen.

885
00:34:03.105 --> 00:34:05.175
She's on the phone right now!

886
00:34:06.527 --> 00:34:07.527
Hi!

887
00:34:09.003 --> 00:34:10.377
Freshman?

888
00:34:10.378 --> 00:34:11.378
Senior.

889
00:34:11.863 --> 00:34:13.319
You looked really young.

890
00:34:13.644 --> 00:34:15.619
We can just talk while having dinner.

891
00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:16.620
Can we go inside?

892
00:34:17.729 --> 00:34:19.117
Are you her father?

893
00:34:20.433 --> 00:34:21.433
Dad!

894
00:34:21.472 --> 00:34:22.472
What's wrong?

895
00:34:26.269 --> 00:34:28.498
(She has special reactions...)

896
00:34:28.613 --> 00:34:30.476
We're from JTBC.

897
00:34:31.128 --> 00:34:32.221
It's a show called,

898
00:34:32.222 --> 00:34:33.347
Let's Have Dinner Together!

899
00:34:33.886 --> 00:34:36.324
We just talked to your daughter.

900
00:34:36.652 --> 00:34:38.206
There's her mom!

901
00:34:38.527 --> 00:34:41.169
(Her mom finally arrived too.)

902
00:34:42.331 --> 00:34:43.331
Hi!

903
00:34:43.402 --> 00:34:45.582
Let me explain it to you in 1 minute.

904
00:34:47.097 --> 00:34:48.610
It's about sharing a meal together,

905
00:34:48.644 --> 00:34:50.300
whatever you have in your house is fine.

906
00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:51.370
At my house?

907
00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:52.494
That's what our program is.

908
00:34:52.495 --> 00:34:53.495
Sure!

909
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:56.441
(Amazing.)

910
00:34:56.527 --> 00:34:58.878
(Ho-dong and Yu-ri succeed!)

911
00:34:59.253 --> 00:35:00.253
Hi!

912
00:35:01.159 --> 00:35:02.491
How did you know about our house?

913
00:35:02.855 --> 00:35:04.869
We choose random houses.

914
00:35:05.089 --> 00:35:06.603
We had no idea you lived here.

915
00:35:07.378 --> 00:35:09.304
I thought something was wrong...

916
00:35:10.753 --> 00:35:12.136
Your daughter caused the scene.

917
00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:13.985
My heart's about to explode...

918
00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:15.701
We came back from the movies.

919
00:35:15.831 --> 00:35:18.495
Why didn't you go with your parents?

920
00:35:18.995 --> 00:35:20.608
She had to study...

921
00:35:21.722 --> 00:35:22.963
You can eat with them

922
00:35:22.964 --> 00:35:24.152
because she didn't go!

923
00:35:24.324 --> 00:35:25.488
Then let's go inside...

924
00:35:25.628 --> 00:35:26.628
We have to go.

925
00:35:26.738 --> 00:35:28.733
Kyung-kyu and Sunny has to go.

926
00:35:29.097 --> 00:35:30.773
It'll be just me and Yu-ri.

927
00:35:30.774 --> 00:35:32.100
I have to take a picture...

928
00:35:32.664 --> 00:35:35.254
(Holding Sunny's hands.)

929
00:35:35.688 --> 00:35:37.604
Mom, take a picture of us!

930
00:35:37.945 --> 00:35:39.788
(Despite being excited, can't forget)

931
00:35:39.789 --> 00:35:41.056
(to take pictures.)

932
00:35:41.438 --> 00:35:42.873
Sunny has to go.

933
00:35:43.102 --> 00:35:44.102
Then me too...

934
00:35:44.391 --> 00:35:46.890
(Taking pictures is a must.)

935
00:35:46.891 --> 00:35:47.891
Kyung-kyu too!

936
00:35:49.797 --> 00:35:52.181
(Kyung-kyu finally joins in as well.)

937
00:35:52.422 --> 00:35:53.922
We don't have a lot of time.

938
00:35:54.211 --> 00:35:56.814
(Smile.)

939
00:35:57.289 --> 00:35:58.434
(Satisfied.)

940
00:35:58.508 --> 00:35:59.688
You should get going.

941
00:35:59.719 --> 00:36:01.734
(Time to say goodbye.)

942
00:36:02.649 --> 00:36:03.649
Good luck!

943
00:36:04.578 --> 00:36:05.836
Good luck!

944
00:36:06.016 --> 00:36:07.016
Thanks Sunny!

945
00:36:07.055 --> 00:36:08.055
See you later!

946
00:36:08.117 --> 00:36:09.352
See you next week!

947
00:36:09.391 --> 00:36:10.391
Good luck!

948
00:36:11.008 --> 00:36:12.008
Sunny, don't give up!

949
00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:13.070
Of course!

950
00:36:13.258 --> 00:36:14.398
It's our 10th year!

951
00:36:14.399 --> 00:36:15.399
I know!

952
00:36:15.445 --> 00:36:16.445
Good luck!

953
00:36:16.461 --> 00:36:17.461
Let's go.

954
00:36:18.789 --> 00:36:20.445
With passionate welcome,

955
00:36:20.742 --> 00:36:23.359
they enter a house in Hwaseodong.

956
00:36:24.055 --> 00:36:25.055
Miss!

957
00:36:25.149 --> 00:36:26.781
Could you give us a tour of your yard?

958
00:36:27.257 --> 00:36:28.258
Our yard?

959
00:36:28.774 --> 00:36:29.774
Me?

960
00:36:30.852 --> 00:36:32.072
Dad, help!

961
00:36:33.219 --> 00:36:34.699
She sounds calm now.

962
00:36:34.883 --> 00:36:36.383
Through the intercom, she was...

963
00:36:38.969 --> 00:36:40.664
I've never seen that before.

964
00:36:40.665 --> 00:36:42.466
I thought I was a ghost.

965
00:36:44.227 --> 00:36:45.227
Dad!

966
00:36:45.258 --> 00:36:46.258
Dad, help.

967
00:36:46.328 --> 00:36:49.444
(Doesn't let go of her dad's hand.)

968
00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:51.150
Where are you going?

969
00:36:51.422 --> 00:36:52.720
To get the grill...

970
00:36:53.383 --> 00:36:55.339
(Today's menu is pork belly.)

971
00:36:55.508 --> 00:36:57.533
We eat with my parents every Sunday.

972
00:36:57.914 --> 00:37:00.479
But they're at the movies.

973
00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:04.155
So we were just going to eat ourselves.

974
00:37:04.172 --> 00:37:05.282
That's when you came!

975
00:37:05.414 --> 00:37:07.180
It's not a special menu for us,

976
00:37:07.195 --> 00:37:08.641
but you were gonna eat that anyways?

977
00:37:08.664 --> 00:37:11.034
It's been defrosting for a while now.

978
00:37:12.883 --> 00:37:15.406
(Let's go inside!)

979
00:37:15.774 --> 00:37:17.374
A living room has photos

980
00:37:17.422 --> 00:37:19.335
of the family's happy memories

981
00:37:19.336 --> 00:37:20.336
from the past.

982
00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:23.929
What movie did you watch today?

983
00:37:24.367 --> 00:37:25.367
A Taxi Driver.

984
00:37:27.242 --> 00:37:29.186
It's setting all kinds of records!

985
00:37:31.055 --> 00:37:32.557
What should I do?

986
00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.398
Do you go on a lot of dates

987
00:37:34.399 --> 00:37:35.980
with your husband on weekends?

988
00:37:36.039 --> 00:37:37.039
Yup.

989
00:37:37.055 --> 00:37:38.611
That's so romantic!

990
00:37:39.578 --> 00:37:41.430
You, your husband...

991
00:37:41.531 --> 00:37:42.871
Is Ji-hye your oldest daughter?

992
00:37:42.945 --> 00:37:44.012
No, my youngest.

993
00:37:44.781 --> 00:37:46.884
Her sister's on her way home.

994
00:37:47.711 --> 00:37:50.763
Is she a college student too?

995
00:37:50.914 --> 00:37:52.163
She's a senior.

996
00:37:52.445 --> 00:37:53.977
But she's a senior too.

997
00:37:54.086 --> 00:37:55.570
Her older sister took some time off.

998
00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:02.117
(Still incredulous.)

999
00:38:02.227 --> 00:38:04.110
This show doesn't even have a script!

1000
00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.293
(Shy.)

1001
00:38:08.492 --> 00:38:10.138
Mom, there's a camera on me.

1002
00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:11.711
That's not important right now!

1003
00:38:12.727 --> 00:38:14.211
I don't know what to do...

1004
00:38:14.266 --> 00:38:15.332
Wash vegetables.

1005
00:38:16.914 --> 00:38:20.626
(They get ready for dinner.)

1006
00:38:20.977 --> 00:38:22.735
(Perfect combination)

1007
00:38:22.774 --> 00:38:24.031
(of Kimchi and pork belly.)

1008
00:38:24.641 --> 00:38:26.102
Did you ever watch our show before?

1009
00:38:26.211 --> 00:38:27.211
Nope.

1010
00:38:27.313 --> 00:38:29.354
He hardly watches TV.

1011
00:38:29.563 --> 00:38:32.461
If you didn't know about this show,

1012
00:38:32.664 --> 00:38:34.922
why did you invite us in?

1013
00:38:34.961 --> 00:38:35.961
He's famous!

1014
00:38:36.242 --> 00:38:37.836
The whole country knows who he is.

1015
00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:39.414
Do you know who this is?

1016
00:38:39.453 --> 00:38:40.453
Yup.

1017
00:38:41.766 --> 00:38:43.579
That's a song!

1018
00:38:43.648 --> 00:38:44.775
Girls' Generation.

1019
00:38:44.776 --> 00:38:45.776
That's right!

1020
00:38:46.289 --> 00:38:47.555
She's Girls' Generation?

1021
00:38:47.586 --> 00:38:49.398
(Hears everything despite being busy.)

1022
00:38:49.524 --> 00:38:50.835
Do you need my help?

1023
00:38:50.852 --> 00:38:52.436
It's okay, I can do it!

1024
00:38:52.664 --> 00:38:53.664
I...

1025
00:38:54.008 --> 00:38:55.322
Should've showered.

1026
00:38:55.383 --> 00:38:57.591
I can't take my hat off either!

1027
00:38:58.977 --> 00:39:00.176
Should I put on some make up?

1028
00:39:01.539 --> 00:39:02.969
Go put something on!

1029
00:39:03.203 --> 00:39:04.654
I'll wash these.

1030
00:39:05.899 --> 00:39:08.443
(While Yu-ri helps out,)

1031
00:39:08.594 --> 00:39:11.038
(Ji-hye gets ready too.)

1032
00:39:11.133 --> 00:39:12.430
(Embarrassed.)

1033
00:39:12.492 --> 00:39:13.867
Was the movie good?

1034
00:39:14.227 --> 00:39:15.227
Yes...

1035
00:39:15.242 --> 00:39:16.602
I'm a bit angry right now...

1036
00:39:16.961 --> 00:39:18.313
It reminds me of the old days...

1037
00:39:19.414 --> 00:39:20.781
Where are you from?

1038
00:39:20.852 --> 00:39:21.852
Seoul.

1039
00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:25.592
How about your wife?

1040
00:39:25.593 --> 00:39:26.593
Jeonju.

1041
00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:30.175
When did you move to Suwon?

1042
00:39:30.414 --> 00:39:31.414
In 1999...

1043
00:39:32.039 --> 00:39:33.445
In 1999,

1044
00:39:33.836 --> 00:39:35.630
I came here to build apartments

1045
00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:38.670
then settled down.

1046
00:39:39.047 --> 00:39:41.531
Are you in constructions?

1047
00:39:41.789 --> 00:39:42.971
Part of LG.

1048
00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:47.399
Then you lived in this house for 18 years?

1049
00:39:48.274 --> 00:39:51.371
We moved here in 2007.

1050
00:39:51.438 --> 00:39:52.963
It's been 10 years.

1051
00:39:53.625 --> 00:39:55.133
Suwon's a great place to live!

1052
00:39:55.328 --> 00:39:56.879
Why is that?

1053
00:39:56.977 --> 00:39:58.211
Everyone likes it here.

1054
00:39:58.336 --> 00:40:00.395
To go watch baseball...

1055
00:40:01.102 --> 00:40:02.368
Or movies in Seoul,

1056
00:40:02.992 --> 00:40:06.465
it takes forever with traffic.

1057
00:40:07.133 --> 00:40:08.633
But not here.

1058
00:40:08.914 --> 00:40:12.282
There aren't as many people here.

1059
00:40:12.633 --> 00:40:14.620
When we go somewhere...

1060
00:40:14.758 --> 00:40:16.077
We can exit the highway

1061
00:40:16.078 --> 00:40:17.860
right when traffic starts in Osan.

1062
00:40:17.938 --> 00:40:19.140
It's got good transportation.

1063
00:40:19.141 --> 00:40:20.976
Suwon and Osan are where

1064
00:40:20.977 --> 00:40:23.352
traffic starts!

1065
00:40:23.524 --> 00:40:25.062
But that's when I exit.

1066
00:40:27.367 --> 00:40:29.195
Isn't that your daughter?

1067
00:40:29.899 --> 00:40:30.899
Come in!

1068
00:40:30.969 --> 00:40:33.012
I thought she was our writer!

1069
00:40:33.048 --> 00:40:34.790
She kept taking pictures!

1070
00:40:35.517 --> 00:40:37.211
(She couldn't come in)

1071
00:40:37.212 --> 00:40:39.134
(so she just took photos.)

1072
00:40:39.306 --> 00:40:40.306
Welcome back!

1073
00:40:40.946 --> 00:40:42.954
(Choi Seol. Age 24.)

1074
00:40:43.602 --> 00:40:44.602
Is this okay?

1075
00:40:46.102 --> 00:40:47.102
Hi!

1076
00:40:47.899 --> 00:40:49.484
(Today's oldest daughter, Yu-ri.)

1077
00:40:49.556 --> 00:40:50.727
Shake her hand!

1078
00:40:51.438 --> 00:40:53.264
We have to eat together!

1079
00:40:53.774 --> 00:40:55.565
Did you set the spoons?

1080
00:40:56.095 --> 00:40:57.627
Yup.

1081
00:40:58.126 --> 00:40:59.830
With the help of her 3 daughters,

1082
00:40:59.831 --> 00:41:02.056
the dinner is quickly being made.

1083
00:41:03.884 --> 00:41:07.598
(Korean pancakes made from scratch.)

1084
00:41:08.923 --> 00:41:10.375
With a perfect teamwork of

1085
00:41:10.376 --> 00:41:11.946
3 daughters setting the table

1086
00:41:12.102 --> 00:41:13.902
and their mother cooking...

1087
00:41:17.727 --> 00:41:21.025
The meal was ready in no time.

1088
00:41:25.618 --> 00:41:26.992
(Ji-hye put on a makeup.)

1089
00:41:26.993 --> 00:41:27.993
Are you crazy?

1090
00:41:28.024 --> 00:41:29.024
Am I too white?

1091
00:41:29.384 --> 00:41:30.791
Ji-hye, go put this over there.

1092
00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:31.970
No!

1093
00:41:32.024 --> 00:41:33.356
Aren't I too white?

1094
00:41:33.649 --> 00:41:34.927
(It's okay.)

1095
00:41:34.985 --> 00:41:36.451
I didn't put a makeup on in 4 weeks.

1096
00:41:36.509 --> 00:41:37.784
4 weeks?

1097
00:41:38.571 --> 00:41:39.941
Your eyebrows are too thick.

1098
00:41:40.431 --> 00:41:42.118
Do you want my help?

1099
00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:45.977
It feels like you have a lot of daughters.

1100
00:41:47.415 --> 00:41:49.859
You don't look out of place in there!

1101
00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:51.919
(3 sisters cooking with their mom.)

1102
00:41:52.009 --> 00:41:53.342
Welcome to my house.

1103
00:41:53.454 --> 00:41:55.415
Can we drink on TV?

1104
00:41:55.477 --> 00:41:56.477
Of course!

1105
00:41:56.524 --> 00:41:58.387
Is that what you normally do?

1106
00:41:58.388 --> 00:41:59.388
Yes.

1107
00:41:59.649 --> 00:42:01.494
That's what's most important here!

1108
00:42:01.892 --> 00:42:03.876
Sir, you don't have to act differently...

1109
00:42:03.923 --> 00:42:04.923
Don't call me sir!

1110
00:42:04.993 --> 00:42:06.606
I'm not that much older than you!

1111
00:42:06.727 --> 00:42:08.030
You are!

1112
00:42:08.056 --> 00:42:09.969
(He still feels young inside.)

1113
00:42:10.048 --> 00:42:12.685
I tend to do that to fathers...

1114
00:42:12.743 --> 00:42:13.943
Is that right sir?

1115
00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:16.536
(Si-hoo's father.)

1116
00:42:16.571 --> 00:42:18.157
What year were you born?

1117
00:42:18.188 --> 00:42:19.188
1966.

1118
00:42:19.649 --> 00:42:22.468
You're much older than I am!

1119
00:42:22.688 --> 00:42:25.009
I was born in the 70s!

1120
00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:27.462
Weren't you born around 70 or 71?

1121
00:42:27.704 --> 00:42:28.704
1970...

1122
00:42:28.751 --> 00:42:30.446
(Only 4 years older.)

1123
00:42:30.532 --> 00:42:32.492
You just married earlier than I did.

1124
00:42:32.493 --> 00:42:33.493
Of course!

1125
00:42:33.532 --> 00:42:35.259
I got married when I was 27.

1126
00:42:35.415 --> 00:42:36.415
Mid 20s...

1127
00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.837
My wife was 24.

1128
00:42:38.899 --> 00:42:40.104
In prime of her life.

1129
00:42:40.884 --> 00:42:42.274
If you look at our old photos...

1130
00:42:42.446 --> 00:42:43.513
She's beautiful.

1131
00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:48.125
(When she was more beautiful than flowers.)

1132
00:42:48.173 --> 00:42:49.243
How did you two meet?

1133
00:42:49.837 --> 00:42:53.259
My little sister was in her major.

1134
00:42:53.345 --> 00:42:54.540
In a same university?

1135
00:42:54.845 --> 00:42:56.485
You knew her through your sister?

1136
00:42:56.665 --> 00:42:58.118
My sister...

1137
00:42:59.188 --> 00:43:00.188
Did it...

1138
00:43:02.548 --> 00:43:03.759
Do what?

1139
00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.029
She set us up.

1140
00:43:05.337 --> 00:43:07.688
Where did you two first meet?

1141
00:43:08.634 --> 00:43:09.953
At Jongno.

1142
00:43:09.954 --> 00:43:11.087
With your sister?

1143
00:43:11.415 --> 00:43:13.860
Was she there?

1144
00:43:13.899 --> 00:43:14.899
She came too.

1145
00:43:14.954 --> 00:43:18.287
Did having her there help?

1146
00:43:18.774 --> 00:43:20.165
She didn't...

1147
00:43:20.384 --> 00:43:22.250
Introduce me as her brother.

1148
00:43:22.946 --> 00:43:24.648
I heard she told my wife

1149
00:43:24.649 --> 00:43:27.446
that I was just someone she knew...

1150
00:43:27.681 --> 00:43:29.945
In case my wife didn't want

1151
00:43:29.946 --> 00:43:31.389
to meet her friend's brother.

1152
00:43:31.407 --> 00:43:32.884
Because it could be awkward...

1153
00:43:33.196 --> 00:43:36.679
(That's how they first met.)

1154
00:43:36.774 --> 00:43:38.841
We'll ask about your love story

1155
00:43:38.915 --> 00:43:40.103
in more details soon.

1156
00:43:40.104 --> 00:43:41.796
(Already embarrassed.)

1157
00:43:41.915 --> 00:43:44.010
Which cup should we use for rice wines?

1158
00:43:44.102 --> 00:43:46.039
We normally use this cup.

1159
00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:48.556
Okay, I'll just take these then.

1160
00:43:49.532 --> 00:43:51.392
I'll do it, I'm the expert!

1161
00:43:51.548 --> 00:43:53.751
(Here comes the technique.)

1162
00:43:53.845 --> 00:43:56.753
(Exquisite wrist snaps.)

1163
00:43:58.759 --> 00:44:00.658
(A true expert.)

1164
00:44:00.659 --> 00:44:03.400
(Even uses a spoon as a tool.)

1165
00:44:03.401 --> 00:44:04.914
What was that?

1166
00:44:04.915 --> 00:44:06.248
You have to knock...

1167
00:44:06.267 --> 00:44:07.398
Before you open it.

1168
00:44:08.274 --> 00:44:11.535
(How an expert handles rice wines.)

1169
00:44:11.681 --> 00:44:13.987
(Closes the bottle.)

1170
00:44:14.071 --> 00:44:15.431
(Knocks again.)

1171
00:44:15.446 --> 00:44:16.718
I'm going in!

1172
00:44:18.032 --> 00:44:19.367
(More careful than going into)

1173
00:44:19.368 --> 00:44:20.712
(his kid's room during puberty.)

1174
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:21.961
It didn't overflow.

1175
00:44:23.126 --> 00:44:24.352
There's no gas!

1176
00:44:24.501 --> 00:44:26.407
Do you drink rice wine often when you eat?

1177
00:44:26.813 --> 00:44:27.813
All the time.

1178
00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:28.860
All the time?

1179
00:44:29.563 --> 00:44:31.181
I drink it instead of eating rice.

1180
00:44:31.649 --> 00:44:32.649
He doesn't eat rice.

1181
00:44:33.306 --> 00:44:34.852
You don't eat carbs?

1182
00:44:34.899 --> 00:44:35.899
Not that much.

1183
00:44:35.954 --> 00:44:37.021
Just for dinner.

1184
00:44:37.446 --> 00:44:39.204
So you do eat it for breakfast and lunch.

1185
00:44:40.774 --> 00:44:42.485
But carbs for dinner is rice wine?

1186
00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:45.259
Wow, this table might break

1187
00:44:45.306 --> 00:44:46.506
with so much food.

1188
00:44:46.634 --> 00:44:48.570
I have to take a picture of this first.

1189
00:44:48.571 --> 00:44:49.571
We do?

1190
00:44:50.587 --> 00:44:54.203
(Pork belly goes on the grill.)

1191
00:44:55.079 --> 00:44:56.362
I can't fit everything!

1192
00:44:57.899 --> 00:44:59.998
(Uses a huge camera from the kitchen.)

1193
00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:02.040
A meal from Hwaseodong in Suwon.

1194
00:45:02.813 --> 00:45:03.813
This meal...

1195
00:45:04.142 --> 00:45:06.337
Is a dinner on a weekend by a family

1196
00:45:06.446 --> 00:45:08.868
of their normal menu, pork belly

1197
00:45:09.259 --> 00:45:11.476
with assortments of vegetables

1198
00:45:11.477 --> 00:45:13.282
and side dishes.

1199
00:45:13.868 --> 00:45:14.868
Ma'am!

1200
00:45:15.696 --> 00:45:18.326
It's called  The Dinner Theater.

1201
00:45:18.657 --> 00:45:20.702
Imagine as if we don't exist.

1202
00:45:21.845 --> 00:45:22.845
Come here.

1203
00:45:25.001 --> 00:45:28.110
(A Sunday dinner in Hwaseodong.)

1204
00:45:28.501 --> 00:45:30.370
(He pours rice wine for his daughters.)

1205
00:45:30.454 --> 00:45:31.687
Who's going to pour it for me?

1206
00:45:31.688 --> 00:45:32.688
I will!

1207
00:45:33.938 --> 00:45:34.969
Fill it up!

1208
00:45:35.313 --> 00:45:36.407
Come here!

1209
00:45:37.962 --> 00:45:38.962
Cheers!

1210
00:45:40.517 --> 00:45:42.023
Cheers.

1211
00:45:42.462 --> 00:45:47.127
(A dinner scene with rice wine.)

1212
00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:49.360
Let's eat.

1213
00:45:49.384 --> 00:45:50.548
Bon appetit!

1214
00:45:51.267 --> 00:45:52.485
Enjoy.

1215
00:45:53.017 --> 00:45:54.350
Where are you going?

1216
00:45:54.767 --> 00:45:56.812
(She tried to run away.)

1217
00:45:56.899 --> 00:45:58.008
Why are you home so early?

1218
00:45:58.829 --> 00:46:01.067
I got out 30 minutes early today.

1219
00:46:01.126 --> 00:46:02.996
(Her mom ran away to the kitchen.)

1220
00:46:03.431 --> 00:46:04.813
This is so awkward...

1221
00:46:04.938 --> 00:46:05.938
I know.

1222
00:46:06.485 --> 00:46:08.187
I'm still wearing a hat...

1223
00:46:08.345 --> 00:46:10.430
(How cute.)

1224
00:46:11.118 --> 00:46:12.926
This isn't the debut I had in mind.

1225
00:46:14.251 --> 00:46:15.795
Can you come already?

1226
00:46:18.688 --> 00:46:20.079
This isn't easy, is it?

1227
00:46:21.259 --> 00:46:22.455
Please take a seat.

1228
00:46:23.313 --> 00:46:26.282
Ho-dong, do you want some rice wine?

1229
00:46:26.337 --> 00:46:27.404
How about Yu-ri?

1230
00:46:27.485 --> 00:46:29.420
Of course I have to drink!

1231
00:46:30.673 --> 00:46:31.829
What are you talking about!

1232
00:46:31.876 --> 00:46:33.719
Girls' Generation drinks rice wines too?

1233
00:46:33.907 --> 00:46:35.250
(Rice wine is the best.)

1234
00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:36.751
But isn't this cup too big?

1235
00:46:36.806 --> 00:46:37.871
It's okay!

1236
00:46:38.532 --> 00:46:41.220
(Drinks rice win out of a beer cup.)

1237
00:46:41.774 --> 00:46:42.774
Thank you.

1238
00:46:42.821 --> 00:46:44.164
I didn't know Girls' Generation

1239
00:46:44.165 --> 00:46:45.303
drinks rice wines too.

1240
00:46:45.345 --> 00:46:47.219
(Only half full because the cup is huge.)

1241
00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:48.945
(Disappointed.)

1242
00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:51.294
(Ho-dong gets a glass too.)

1243
00:46:51.376 --> 00:46:53.050
Thank you for the food!

1244
00:46:54.298 --> 00:46:55.298
(Cheers!)

1245
00:46:55.352 --> 00:46:56.352
Sorry.

1246
00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:57.467
(To the staff members.)

1247
00:46:58.696 --> 00:47:01.809
(Starts with rice wine first.)

1248
00:47:08.079 --> 00:47:10.310
(Pork belly is almost cooked.)

1249
00:47:10.501 --> 00:47:12.215
(While the meat is being cooked,)

1250
00:47:12.216 --> 00:47:13.859
(she tries the Korean pancakes first.)

1251
00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:15.579
I can't finish the whole thing.

1252
00:47:18.438 --> 00:47:19.438
How is it?

1253
00:47:19.923 --> 00:47:21.590
Very delicious!

1254
00:47:22.095 --> 00:47:23.680
We always have food like this

1255
00:47:23.681 --> 00:47:25.614
so he can eat with rice wine.

1256
00:47:26.392 --> 00:47:28.197
He doesn't eat...

1257
00:47:28.337 --> 00:47:30.808
Put it on top of the rice.

1258
00:47:31.423 --> 00:47:33.329
Then eat it with Kimchi.

1259
00:47:33.907 --> 00:47:35.603
Can't get full just yet...

1260
00:47:36.181 --> 00:47:38.297
The real deal is still waiting.

1261
00:47:40.017 --> 00:47:42.211
(Yu-ri gets a piece of meat.)

1262
00:47:42.212 --> 00:47:43.896
Try this with it.

1263
00:47:44.267 --> 00:47:47.404
(Puts the vegetable on the wrap.)

1264
00:47:47.431 --> 00:47:49.063
Yu-ri, the daughter for the day,

1265
00:47:49.267 --> 00:47:51.200
eats the wrap made by her mom

1266
00:47:52.017 --> 00:47:54.377
and drinks the rice wine poured by her dad.

1267
00:47:56.056 --> 00:47:57.556
Then drinks some more

1268
00:47:57.782 --> 00:47:59.516
after a bite of a pancake.

1269
00:48:00.626 --> 00:48:02.889
We always thought she was a girl...

1270
00:48:03.173 --> 00:48:04.797
But now she's a lady who knows

1271
00:48:04.798 --> 00:48:06.398
how to drink rice wines.

1272
00:48:08.899 --> 00:48:10.885
(Huge.)

1273
00:48:11.157 --> 00:48:12.726
Ho-dong is trying to beat his record

1274
00:48:12.727 --> 00:48:14.527
for the biggest wrap again.

1275
00:48:16.446 --> 00:48:18.220
With an incredible size

1276
00:48:18.985 --> 00:48:20.719
and the size of his mouth,

1277
00:48:20.813 --> 00:48:22.813
there's no room for rice wine.

1278
00:48:27.532 --> 00:48:30.406
This is what Sunny was talking about!

1279
00:48:30.946 --> 00:48:33.868
Sunny was doing a show with Ho-dong...

1280
00:48:33.985 --> 00:48:35.548
When he was eating wraps,

1281
00:48:36.204 --> 00:48:37.234
she thought they reached

1282
00:48:37.235 --> 00:48:39.946
the back of his head.

1283
00:48:40.313 --> 00:48:42.039
(An extraordinary size.)

1284
00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:43.278
This is what she meant!

1285
00:48:43.345 --> 00:48:44.519
It's that big!

1286
00:48:45.251 --> 00:48:47.606
The back of my head moves when I eat.

1287
00:48:50.595 --> 00:48:51.595
Eww...

1288
00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:52.860
She said eww!

1289
00:48:53.227 --> 00:48:55.594
(Shocking.)

1290
00:48:56.563 --> 00:48:58.384
While they're enjoying the unexpected

1291
00:48:58.446 --> 00:49:01.298
rice wine and pork belly party...

1292
00:49:04.235 --> 00:49:05.820
These two can't even dream

1293
00:49:05.821 --> 00:49:07.421
about eating pork belly.

1294
00:49:08.048 --> 00:49:09.048
Sunny.

1295
00:49:13.001 --> 00:49:14.001
Good sound.

1296
00:49:15.985 --> 00:49:16.985
Who is it?

1297
00:49:17.204 --> 00:49:19.901
Hi, I'm sunny from Girls' Generation...

1298
00:49:20.985 --> 00:49:22.553
Are you joking?

1299
00:49:22.579 --> 00:49:24.674
No, I'm really her.

1300
00:49:26.610 --> 00:49:28.555
We're shooting for a show from JTBC,

1301
00:49:28.556 --> 00:49:30.356
Let's Have Dinner Together.

1302
00:49:30.431 --> 00:49:31.431
Okay.

1303
00:49:31.923 --> 00:49:34.032
If it's okay...

1304
00:49:34.329 --> 00:49:36.345
Can we eat dinner together?

1305
00:49:38.313 --> 00:49:39.892
We were just about to head out.

1306
00:49:40.235 --> 00:49:42.955
We're eating ice cream right now...

1307
00:49:43.509 --> 00:49:45.056
Did you eat already?

1308
00:49:45.095 --> 00:49:46.095
Yes!

1309
00:49:46.571 --> 00:49:47.571
Okay.

1310
00:49:47.618 --> 00:49:48.927
We ate sundae soup!

1311
00:49:49.017 --> 00:49:50.017
I see...

1312
00:49:50.056 --> 00:49:52.588
(Even tells them what he ate...)

1313
00:49:52.892 --> 00:49:56.106
(Even more hungry now...)

1314
00:49:56.954 --> 00:49:58.969
(Which house will let Kyung-kyu and Sunny)

1315
00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:00.236
(in for dinner...?)

1316
00:50:00.892 --> 00:50:02.101
It's 7:30...

1317
00:50:02.142 --> 00:50:03.600
Everyone must've eaten by now.

1318
00:50:03.719 --> 00:50:04.720
Here?

1319
00:50:04.751 --> 00:50:06.392
(They press on...)

1320
00:50:06.954 --> 00:50:07.954
No noise.

1321
00:50:08.735 --> 00:50:09.735
Nothing.

1322
00:50:10.274 --> 00:50:12.653
(They're both broken this time...)

1323
00:50:13.899 --> 00:50:15.548
Why are they all broken?

1324
00:50:17.032 --> 00:50:19.534
(Tries the house right across.)

1325
00:50:22.267 --> 00:50:24.653
(It's broken here too...)

1326
00:50:24.735 --> 00:50:26.168
We should get out of here.

1327
00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:30.988
(The time keeps passing...)

1328
00:50:31.657 --> 00:50:32.924
We still have time!

1329
00:50:34.259 --> 00:50:36.158
(But...)

1330
00:50:36.196 --> 00:50:37.355
There's no sound.

1331
00:50:39.923 --> 00:50:42.619
(Don't have time anymore...)

1332
00:50:42.946 --> 00:50:44.422
They're all broken.

1333
00:50:48.532 --> 00:50:51.915
(No matter how much they ring,)

1334
00:50:51.916 --> 00:50:54.689
(not a single one works...)

1335
00:50:55.368 --> 00:50:56.712
They're all broken...

1336
00:50:58.454 --> 00:51:00.310
They're all broken!

1337
00:51:00.477 --> 00:51:02.616
(And to make things worse...)

1338
00:51:02.759 --> 00:51:04.517
Oh, here's the bell.

1339
00:51:05.337 --> 00:51:06.996
Who's gonna use this?

1340
00:51:08.642 --> 00:51:10.955
(Tries to get his hand in there...)

1341
00:51:11.868 --> 00:51:12.999
Hello?

1342
00:51:13.634 --> 00:51:16.544
(This bell is broken too...)

1343
00:51:16.915 --> 00:51:18.492
(Are they gonna end up)

1344
00:51:18.493 --> 00:51:19.753
(at the convenience store?)

1345
00:51:19.993 --> 00:51:22.921
(Soaked by sweat...)

1346
00:51:24.759 --> 00:51:26.009
Why are they all broken?

1347
00:51:26.563 --> 00:51:29.352
Everyone should fix their bell.

1348
00:51:32.985 --> 00:51:35.701
(Finally the one that works!)

1349
00:51:35.931 --> 00:51:36.931
Hello?

1350
00:51:38.204 --> 00:51:39.204
Who is it?

1351
00:51:39.681 --> 00:51:40.681
Sunny?

1352
00:51:40.899 --> 00:51:42.330
Come inside and eat!

1353
00:51:42.767 --> 00:51:44.485
(What are you doing?)

1354
00:51:44.743 --> 00:51:46.134
I've been waiting.

1355
00:51:47.259 --> 00:51:48.384
Why don't you come in?

1356
00:51:49.962 --> 00:51:51.410
I know who you are...

1357
00:51:53.306 --> 00:51:54.439
Someone's coming!

1358
00:51:55.962 --> 00:51:56.962
Umm...

1359
00:51:58.056 --> 00:51:59.517
Hi!

1360
00:52:00.571 --> 00:52:02.931
This is Sunny from Girls' Generation!

1361
00:52:03.907 --> 00:52:05.595
Do you know Let's Have Dinner Together?

1362
00:52:05.923 --> 00:52:06.923
Yes!

1363
00:52:07.204 --> 00:52:08.438
I'm Lee Kyung-kyu!

1364
00:52:08.696 --> 00:52:10.149
Hi!

1365
00:52:10.321 --> 00:52:11.751
What were you up to?

1366
00:52:11.954 --> 00:52:13.149
I was eating dinner.

1367
00:52:13.251 --> 00:52:14.998
Are you done eating?

1368
00:52:15.321 --> 00:52:16.462
Can I come outside?

1369
00:52:16.493 --> 00:52:17.864
Of course!

1370
00:52:18.368 --> 00:52:19.647
Why are you all wet?

1371
00:52:19.727 --> 00:52:21.007
It's too hot.

1372
00:52:21.095 --> 00:52:22.730
Here's Sunny.

1373
00:52:23.165 --> 00:52:24.290
How can I help you?

1374
00:52:24.337 --> 00:52:26.287
We're from Let's Have Dinner Together...

1375
00:52:26.384 --> 00:52:28.664
(Looks like it's a secret conversation...)

1376
00:52:28.681 --> 00:52:29.681
Are you eating here?

1377
00:52:29.712 --> 00:52:31.228
I don't know the show too well...

1378
00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:33.441
We go in if you let us...

1379
00:52:33.509 --> 00:52:35.102
(Needs the whole family's permission.)

1380
00:52:35.149 --> 00:52:37.595
We even brought our spoons.

1381
00:52:38.384 --> 00:52:40.320
Are your parents home?

1382
00:52:40.321 --> 00:52:41.321
Yes.

1383
00:52:41.352 --> 00:52:42.500
Could you go ask?

1384
00:52:42.751 --> 00:52:45.650
(Goes in to ask his parents.)

1385
00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:47.023
(A success finally...?)

1386
00:52:47.118 --> 00:52:48.307
The moon's out!

1387
00:52:48.837 --> 00:52:50.289
Look at the moon!

1388
00:52:50.290 --> 00:52:51.445
(That's not important...)

1389
00:52:51.446 --> 00:52:52.970
The moon's out and we were

1390
00:52:53.181 --> 00:52:54.920
just talking about lunch...

1391
00:52:54.921 --> 00:52:57.024
Look how bright the moon is!

1392
00:52:58.142 --> 00:52:59.142
Hi!

1393
00:52:59.532 --> 00:53:00.774
I'm Lee Kyung-kyu.

1394
00:53:00.837 --> 00:53:02.087
Hello.

1395
00:53:02.399 --> 00:53:04.094
I know this show.

1396
00:53:04.165 --> 00:53:05.165
Did you eat...?

1397
00:53:05.212 --> 00:53:06.919
My wife doesn't want to...

1398
00:53:07.876 --> 00:53:08.876
Thanks.

1399
00:53:09.368 --> 00:53:10.993
(Thanks for coming out.)

1400
00:53:11.056 --> 00:53:13.628
I love this show.

1401
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:15.470
Thank you.

1402
00:53:15.704 --> 00:53:17.878
We have to get going!

1403
00:53:19.509 --> 00:53:20.509
Sorry...

1404
00:53:20.548 --> 00:53:21.548
It's okay!

1405
00:53:22.767 --> 00:53:25.492
(Things were looking good...)

1406
00:53:25.493 --> 00:53:27.731
(But failed again.)

1407
00:53:27.782 --> 00:53:31.719
(Kyung-kyu's hair is getting more wet...)

1408
00:53:31.774 --> 00:53:33.336
I haven't been to a convenience store

1409
00:53:33.337 --> 00:53:34.337
in a while.

1410
00:53:34.509 --> 00:53:37.279
(Tries an apartment this time.)

1411
00:53:41.696 --> 00:53:42.696
Oh my god!

1412
00:53:43.048 --> 00:53:44.368
Hi!

1413
00:53:44.806 --> 00:53:46.436
I'm Lee Kyung-kyu!

1414
00:53:46.634 --> 00:53:48.710
Hi, I'm Sunny from Girls' Generation!

1415
00:53:48.931 --> 00:53:50.712
(Intense welcome.)

1416
00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:51.899
Give me a minute!

1417
00:53:51.962 --> 00:53:52.962
Okay!

1418
00:53:52.993 --> 00:53:55.728
(Then the gate opens.)

1419
00:53:56.017 --> 00:53:57.523
(Sunny's back is soaked too.)

1420
00:53:57.524 --> 00:53:58.524
Hi!

1421
00:53:58.563 --> 00:53:59.563
Hi!

1422
00:54:00.446 --> 00:54:01.446
Hello.

1423
00:54:01.493 --> 00:54:03.059
(Things are looking up?)

1424
00:54:03.368 --> 00:54:04.552
Did you eat yet?9

1425
00:54:04.553 --> 00:54:06.290
We already did...

1426
00:54:08.165 --> 00:54:09.540
You ate already?

1427
00:54:09.595 --> 00:54:11.436
(Didn't know about the show...)

1428
00:54:11.586 --> 00:54:12.938
We can't go in if you ate.

1429
00:54:14.336 --> 00:54:15.337
That sucks...

1430
00:54:16.431 --> 00:54:19.126
(Sunny rings the next door.)

1431
00:54:21.493 --> 00:54:22.665
Hi.

1432
00:54:22.767 --> 00:54:24.967
I'm Sunny from Girls' Generation.

1433
00:54:25.376 --> 00:54:26.376
Give me a minute.

1434
00:54:27.321 --> 00:54:28.367
Give me a minute?

1435
00:54:30.071 --> 00:54:31.668
(Kyung-kyu is ready to go upstairs.)

1436
00:54:31.727 --> 00:54:32.727
I'll wait here!

1437
00:54:34.048 --> 00:54:36.963
(It's 7:53!)

1438
00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:39.517
(The door finally opened...)

1439
00:54:40.509 --> 00:54:42.040
(Failed after 1 second.)

1440
00:54:42.087 --> 00:54:43.087
Who is it?

1441
00:54:43.673 --> 00:54:45.024
(Met another residence...)

1442
00:54:45.079 --> 00:54:46.613
I'm Lee Kyung-kyu.

1443
00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:49.100
Did you eat dinner already?

1444
00:54:49.212 --> 00:54:50.212
Yes...

1445
00:54:50.251 --> 00:54:52.221
(Already ate...)

1446
00:54:52.595 --> 00:54:55.690
(There's not a lot of time left!)

1447
00:54:58.884 --> 00:54:59.884
Hello?

1448
00:54:59.946 --> 00:55:00.946
Hi!

1449
00:55:01.126 --> 00:55:03.459
I'm not in a state for a TV camera...

1450
00:55:04.118 --> 00:55:06.366
(Failed again...)

1451
00:55:06.712 --> 00:55:09.247
(They ring together this time.)

1452
00:55:10.571 --> 00:55:13.771
(Please...)

1453
00:55:14.368 --> 00:55:15.733
We only have 5 minutes!

1454
00:55:16.899 --> 00:55:19.540
(Can't waste anymore time.)

1455
00:55:19.899 --> 00:55:20.899
Hurry!

1456
00:55:21.837 --> 00:55:23.104
We don't have time!

1457
00:55:23.735 --> 00:55:25.523
(Failure means going)

1458
00:55:25.524 --> 00:55:27.166
(to the convenience store...)

1459
00:55:28.602 --> 00:55:32.083
(Anyone home?)

1460
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:35.431
(Can't wait.)

1461
00:55:35.595 --> 00:55:39.746
(1 minute left!)

1462
00:55:40.852 --> 00:55:41.852
Hello?

1463
00:55:43.579 --> 00:55:44.579
Hi!

1464
00:55:46.212 --> 00:55:47.454
I'm Lee Kyung-kyu!

1465
00:55:48.407 --> 00:55:50.369
I know, but what are you doing here?

1466
00:55:50.501 --> 00:55:53.498
If you didn't eat yet...

1467
00:55:53.829 --> 00:55:57.056
And if you invite us in...

1468
00:55:57.306 --> 00:55:59.073
It's a show where we eat together.

1469
00:55:59.212 --> 00:56:00.586
Give me a minute!

1470
00:56:00.587 --> 00:56:01.587
Okay!

1471
00:56:02.883 --> 00:56:04.064
Not yet!

1472
00:56:05.712 --> 00:56:07.360
(The door opens.)

1473
00:56:07.454 --> 00:56:08.454
Hi!

1474
00:56:09.157 --> 00:56:10.157
Hi.

1475
00:56:10.415 --> 00:56:11.415
Hello.

1476
00:56:12.196 --> 00:56:13.743
Here's Sunny from Girls' Generation.

1477
00:56:14.876 --> 00:56:16.307
(Sunny?)

1478
00:56:16.321 --> 00:56:17.321
Hi!

1479
00:56:17.634 --> 00:56:18.634
Her name is Sun-hee.

1480
00:56:18.727 --> 00:56:19.727
Really?

1481
00:56:19.931 --> 00:56:20.931
Hi Sun-hee!

1482
00:56:21.563 --> 00:56:24.142
If you invite us in...

1483
00:56:24.282 --> 00:56:25.282
Is it okay if we eat...

1484
00:56:25.306 --> 00:56:26.587
But we're out of food!

1485
00:56:26.673 --> 00:56:27.946
Ramen is fine.

1486
00:56:30.290 --> 00:56:31.852
We only need rice and water.

1487
00:56:31.977 --> 00:56:33.134
Did you eat yet?

1488
00:56:33.149 --> 00:56:34.352
We were about to.

1489
00:56:34.399 --> 00:56:35.599
Ramen is fine too.

1490
00:56:35.633 --> 00:56:36.634
Anything is okay!

1491
00:56:36.696 --> 00:56:38.341
Our time's up at 4.

1492
00:56:38.806 --> 00:56:39.806
4?

1493
00:56:39.931 --> 00:56:40.931
I mean 8!

1494
00:56:41.727 --> 00:56:43.158
But our house is such a mess!

1495
00:56:43.227 --> 00:56:45.033
We'll give you time to clean.

1496
00:56:45.034 --> 00:56:46.710
What time is it right now?

1497
00:56:46.899 --> 00:56:48.438
It's 8!

1498
00:56:48.587 --> 00:56:51.274
If you don't invite us in...

1499
00:56:51.618 --> 00:56:53.188
We have to go to the convenience store.

1500
00:56:53.243 --> 00:56:54.595
No, don't go!

1501
00:56:55.751 --> 00:56:56.751
She said, don't go!

1502
00:56:57.696 --> 00:56:59.648
Which ramen do you want?

1503
00:57:00.743 --> 00:57:02.409
(Anything is fine.)

1504
00:57:02.485 --> 00:57:04.532
(He just goes in now...)

1505
00:57:04.727 --> 00:57:07.859
Would you like to eat with me and Sunny?

1506
00:57:09.649 --> 00:57:10.649
Thank you!

1507
00:57:12.243 --> 00:57:14.648
(Finally succeeds!)

1508
00:57:14.704 --> 00:57:16.000
Thank you so much!

1509
00:57:16.548 --> 00:57:17.548
Success!

1510
00:57:17.626 --> 00:57:19.875
(Right at the buzzer...!)

1511
00:57:19.876 --> 00:57:21.809
We can give you time to clean.

1512
00:57:25.438 --> 00:57:26.821
Hi!

1513
00:57:27.352 --> 00:57:29.102
Sun-hee's house in Suwon

1514
00:57:29.243 --> 00:57:31.110
opened their door for Sunny.

1515
00:57:31.415 --> 00:57:33.009
Can we go in?

1516
00:57:33.142 --> 00:57:36.009
Don't feel pressure about the cameras.

1517
00:57:36.423 --> 00:57:37.899
Did you watch our show before?

1518
00:57:38.165 --> 00:57:39.821
It's called Let's Have Dinner Together.

1519
00:57:39.852 --> 00:57:41.175
It's on JTBC...

1520
00:57:41.259 --> 00:57:42.680
I like that station!

1521
00:57:43.376 --> 00:57:44.562
Do you know who I am?

1522
00:57:44.806 --> 00:57:45.806
Lee Kyung-kyu!

1523
00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:52.975
(Caught off guard by a foreigner.)

1524
00:57:53.063 --> 00:57:54.806
(He's a Filipino American!)

1525
00:57:54.821 --> 00:57:55.821
He's a Filipino American.

1526
00:57:57.274 --> 00:58:00.030
(First multi-cultural family!)

1527
00:58:01.634 --> 00:58:02.634
Only a little.

1528
00:58:02.798 --> 00:58:03.798
(Relieved.)

1529
00:58:03.837 --> 00:58:05.698
He loves Girls' Generation.

1530
00:58:06.337 --> 00:58:08.516
(Her husband was a huge fan.)

1531
00:58:08.517 --> 00:58:09.642
How old is your baby?

1532
00:58:09.696 --> 00:58:11.056
13 months.

1533
00:58:12.290 --> 00:58:13.290
Hi!

1534
00:58:14.587 --> 00:58:15.587
Sunny?

1535
00:58:15.852 --> 00:58:17.005
She's Sun-hee.

1536
00:58:18.126 --> 00:58:19.126
Ma'am.

1537
00:58:19.196 --> 00:58:20.321
Can I go wash my face?

1538
00:58:20.485 --> 00:58:21.649
Of course!

1539
00:58:21.931 --> 00:58:24.517
(He had a tough day today...)

1540
00:58:24.899 --> 00:58:26.901
You should probably take a shower...

1541
00:58:27.188 --> 00:58:30.004
((Goes to freshen up...)

1542
00:58:30.306 --> 00:58:32.305
Sun-hee lives with a happy family

1543
00:58:32.306 --> 00:58:33.642
of two cultures.

1544
00:58:38.923 --> 00:58:41.127
(Kyung-kyu bravely asks a question.)

1545
00:58:43.431 --> 00:58:44.431
4 years.

1546
00:58:58.767 --> 00:59:01.252
(That's the end of his English.)

1547
00:59:15.884 --> 00:59:17.031
My last name is Cho.

1548
00:59:17.063 --> 00:59:19.027
She must've gotten her mom's last name!

1549
00:59:28.063 --> 00:59:29.634
(He's funny.)

1550
00:59:37.446 --> 00:59:39.649
He did it way before Park Myung-soo.

1551
00:59:41.837 --> 00:59:44.350
How long have you been married for?

1552
00:59:44.431 --> 00:59:46.425
About 2 years.

1553
00:59:48.056 --> 00:59:49.579
How did you guys meet?

1554
00:59:50.134 --> 00:59:53.739
I used to hire English teachers.

1555
00:59:54.235 --> 00:59:57.525
I hired my husband.

1556
00:59:58.610 --> 01:00:00.147
Then hired him at your home too.

1557
01:00:00.329 --> 01:00:03.088
I got him his current life.

1558
01:00:03.227 --> 01:00:05.968
(His new life thanks to his wife...)

1559
01:00:06.095 --> 01:00:08.623
I think he came to Korea for girl groups.

1560
01:00:10.032 --> 01:00:11.909
Who's your favorite?

1561
01:00:15.321 --> 01:00:17.366
(Disappointed.)

1562
01:00:17.399 --> 01:00:18.846
But I like Girls' Generation too.

1563
01:00:20.017 --> 01:00:23.577
The order doesn't matter...

1564
01:00:24.009 --> 01:00:26.243
(Keep it up Sunny.)

1565
01:00:26.462 --> 01:00:27.641
Did you study in America?

1566
01:00:27.993 --> 01:00:30.152
No, I always lived in Korea.

1567
01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:32.672
Do you guys work in a same company?

1568
01:00:32.673 --> 01:00:34.757
No, he works at a school now...

1569
01:00:34.806 --> 01:00:37.306
Is his school close by?

1570
01:00:37.368 --> 01:00:39.556
It's an elementary school in Yeongtong.

1571
01:00:39.587 --> 01:00:40.987
An elementary school!

1572
01:00:42.024 --> 01:00:43.483
That's cool.

1573
01:00:51.556 --> 01:00:52.943
He's an immigrant.

1574
01:00:53.626 --> 01:00:56.200
(Jason was born in the Philippines.)

1575
01:00:57.899 --> 01:00:59.345
Say hi.

1576
01:00:59.899 --> 01:01:01.587
(The water starts to boil.)

1577
01:01:01.642 --> 01:01:03.759
(Stands up.)

1578
01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:07.461
(He helps out in the kitchen.)

1579
01:01:08.235 --> 01:01:10.875
We don't always eat like this...

1580
01:01:11.681 --> 01:01:12.969
We went away for the weekend...

1581
01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:14.277
It's okay.

1582
01:01:14.845 --> 01:01:16.234
Whatever you were gonna have

1583
01:01:16.235 --> 01:01:17.302
is fine with us.

1584
01:01:20.017 --> 01:01:21.938
When the meal they dreamt about

1585
01:01:21.993 --> 01:01:24.260
is cooking inside a boiling pot...

1586
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:30.040
Where did you live before moving here?

1587
01:01:30.587 --> 01:01:31.587
Songpa.

1588
01:01:32.571 --> 01:01:34.614
Then we moved here.

1589
01:01:34.852 --> 01:01:36.568
I see...

1590
01:01:36.931 --> 01:01:38.571
How's Hwaseodong like?

1591
01:01:38.610 --> 01:01:39.610
It's great.

1592
01:01:39.665 --> 01:01:41.267
It's a great place to raise a baby.

1593
01:01:41.462 --> 01:01:43.057
There are a lot of babies here too.

1594
01:01:43.274 --> 01:01:45.359
I think it's much better than Seoul.

1595
01:01:45.712 --> 01:01:48.423
Why did you choose to come to Korea?

1596
01:02:02.118 --> 01:02:03.762
Korean food is delicious.

1597
01:02:10.931 --> 01:02:13.160
I'm grateful that he's using easy English.

1598
01:02:13.196 --> 01:02:15.383
That's how he teaches his kids

1599
01:02:15.384 --> 01:02:16.887
in the elementary school.

1600
01:02:17.087 --> 01:02:18.970
His using his experience

1601
01:02:19.024 --> 01:02:21.086
to stoop down to your level.

1602
01:02:21.087 --> 01:02:22.329
That's why you understand.

1603
01:02:22.392 --> 01:02:23.713
I don't speak English...

1604
01:02:23.899 --> 01:02:25.166
I can speak Korean.

1605
01:02:29.673 --> 01:02:30.946
Do you need help?

1606
01:02:32.321 --> 01:02:33.650
I'll take the plates out.

1607
01:02:33.651 --> 01:02:35.025
Could you pour the sauce then?

1608
01:02:35.892 --> 01:02:39.897
(Got it.)

1609
01:02:40.798 --> 01:02:42.415
Kyung-kyu, the ramen expert

1610
01:02:42.634 --> 01:02:44.164
stands in front of the oven

1611
01:02:44.165 --> 01:02:45.165
to help out.

1612
01:02:47.009 --> 01:02:48.727
Come here!

1613
01:02:50.079 --> 01:02:51.586
You're so cute!

1614
01:02:51.712 --> 01:02:53.616
(Sunny finds Sun-hee adorable.)

1615
01:02:54.931 --> 01:02:56.259
I'm with Girls' Generation...

1616
01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:58.895
And we're about to eat together!

1617
01:02:58.985 --> 01:03:00.791
We're eating ramen together!

1618
01:03:02.977 --> 01:03:04.820
I always thought I'd meet Kyung-kyu

1619
01:03:04.821 --> 01:03:06.488
at least once in my life.

1620
01:03:09.673 --> 01:03:11.024
(It was predicted?)

1621
01:03:11.134 --> 01:03:12.954
Shows like Compassion Fridge...

1622
01:03:13.056 --> 01:03:14.454
You're right.

1623
01:03:14.993 --> 01:03:17.067
Because of you, I always thought

1624
01:03:17.407 --> 01:03:18.820
I'd get to meet you once

1625
01:03:18.821 --> 01:03:20.575
if I kept doing the right things...

1626
01:03:21.282 --> 01:03:22.431
Amazing.

1627
01:03:22.454 --> 01:03:23.899
(Talks and works at the same time.)

1628
01:03:24.001 --> 01:03:25.617
But I was able to be a better person

1629
01:03:25.618 --> 01:03:27.227
because of you.

1630
01:03:27.485 --> 01:03:29.766
(And that person is making ramen)

1631
01:03:29.767 --> 01:03:31.368
(in her kitchen.)

1632
01:03:31.369 --> 01:03:34.850
(Became a chef without realizing it.)

1633
01:03:35.454 --> 01:03:37.187
Kyung-kyu, who she thought

1634
01:03:37.368 --> 01:03:38.805
she'd get to meet

1635
01:03:38.806 --> 01:03:40.399
if she stayed as a good person...

1636
01:03:42.884 --> 01:03:44.930
Became a passionate chef

1637
01:03:44.931 --> 01:03:47.517
on Sunday night!

1638
01:03:47.875 --> 01:03:48.923
It's done!

1639
01:03:49.001 --> 01:03:50.001
Okay!

1640
01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:52.491
(Ramen is complete!)

1641
01:03:53.368 --> 01:03:54.868
Jason puts down the table...

1642
01:03:55.329 --> 01:03:57.571
His wife puts ramen in plates.

1643
01:03:57.782 --> 01:04:00.289
Then today's dinner is ready.

1644
01:04:01.298 --> 01:04:03.399
(Can't forget to take a picture!)

1645
01:04:03.509 --> 01:04:04.509
This meal

1646
01:04:04.767 --> 01:04:07.009
was quickly made

1647
01:04:07.165 --> 01:04:09.898
by a multi-cultural family in Hwaseodong

1648
01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:11.884
on Sunday night.

1649
01:04:13.399 --> 01:04:16.028
Thank you for the food.

1650
01:04:19.712 --> 01:04:20.712
Thank you.

1651
01:04:24.556 --> 01:04:26.320
This is Kyung-kyu's first ramen

1652
01:04:26.321 --> 01:04:28.321
in Let's Have Dinner Together.

1653
01:04:30.962 --> 01:04:32.263
Can I have some more?

1654
01:04:32.337 --> 01:04:33.337
Of course!

1655
01:04:33.727 --> 01:04:35.684
He cleared his plate in a hurry

1656
01:04:36.087 --> 01:04:38.267
as it was very delicious.

1657
01:04:40.157 --> 01:04:41.806
Sun-hee's new family, Sunny

1658
01:04:42.274 --> 01:04:44.118
hurries to eat ramen

1659
01:04:44.165 --> 01:04:45.670
to alleviate her hunger.

1660
01:04:49.290 --> 01:04:50.290
Delicious.

1661
01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:53.306
A father, a fan of Girls' Generation...

1662
01:04:53.813 --> 01:04:55.242
A mother who knew she'd meet

1663
01:04:55.243 --> 01:04:56.470
Kyung-kyu one day...

1664
01:04:56.563 --> 01:04:59.498
They all enjoy a delicious Sunday dinner.

1665
01:05:01.829 --> 01:05:03.300
Why did you let us in?

1666
01:05:04.837 --> 01:05:06.546
Why wouldn't we?

1667
01:05:06.602 --> 01:05:08.924
We know who you are!

1668
01:05:23.337 --> 01:05:26.502
Did you know what program this was?

1669
01:05:26.657 --> 01:05:27.657
I thought...

1670
01:05:27.767 --> 01:05:29.212
This can't be Healing Camp...

1671
01:05:29.243 --> 01:05:30.376
What could it be?

1672
01:05:30.977 --> 01:05:33.931
(Healing Camp was so long ago...)

1673
01:05:35.751 --> 01:05:40.134
I always had 30% of doubts on all TV shows.

1674
01:05:40.384 --> 01:05:42.219
But I guess programs like these

1675
01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:43.399
are really unscripted.

1676
01:05:43.446 --> 01:05:45.179
That's why we're eating here!

1677
01:05:45.212 --> 01:05:47.485
(This is a 100% genuine show.)

1678
01:05:47.665 --> 01:05:49.329
Did you major in English too?

1679
01:05:50.087 --> 01:05:52.102
I majored in law first.

1680
01:05:52.134 --> 01:05:54.000
English was my second major.

1681
01:05:55.587 --> 01:05:57.426
But law wasn't for me...

1682
01:05:58.149 --> 01:06:00.805
So I continued with English.

1683
01:06:03.345 --> 01:06:05.986
(Cute trick by Sun-hee.)

1684
01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:09.107
Do you know any of their songs?

1685
01:06:10.118 --> 01:06:11.318
Girls' Generation?

1686
01:06:25.298 --> 01:06:26.555
(Goosebumps.)

1687
01:06:26.556 --> 01:06:27.954
I just heard it live!

1688
01:06:30.907 --> 01:06:32.999
He knows a lot.

1689
01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.313
He's a girl group expert!

1690
01:06:35.134 --> 01:06:36.671
Is that why he's in Korea?

1691
01:06:36.829 --> 01:06:40.100
When he was a teenager...

1692
01:06:40.813 --> 01:06:42.408
He liked H.O.T.

1693
01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:44.764
(He used to wave the white balloons.)

1694
01:06:47.392 --> 01:06:48.626
He knows!

1695
01:06:48.985 --> 01:06:51.579
He even visited SM a couple of times.

1696
01:06:51.970 --> 01:06:52.970
Her uncle...

1697
01:06:53.392 --> 01:06:54.392
Is Lee Soo-man!

1698
01:06:55.267 --> 01:06:57.835
Is he still alive...?

1699
01:06:58.704 --> 01:06:59.704
Yes...

1700
01:06:59.727 --> 01:07:01.847
(He's like a living legend...)

1701
01:07:02.118 --> 01:07:04.321
He's her real uncle!

1702
01:07:04.602 --> 01:07:05.602
He's my uncle.

1703
01:07:06.774 --> 01:07:07.897
She's a golden parachute?

1704
01:07:10.431 --> 01:07:13.600
I heard that a lot...

1705
01:07:13.657 --> 01:07:14.883
It's been 10 years so...

1706
01:07:14.884 --> 01:07:16.617
(Now, she's a part of the best girl group.)

1707
01:07:16.704 --> 01:07:18.258
Who do you like now?

1708
01:07:18.259 --> 01:07:19.746
Out of the recent ones.

1709
01:07:22.321 --> 01:07:23.321
BTS!

1710
01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:25.012
BTS!

1711
01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:28.704
You don't know who they are, do you?

1712
01:07:28.774 --> 01:07:30.219
Of course I do!

1713
01:07:30.806 --> 01:07:31.962
How many people are in it?

1714
01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:33.869
7?

1715
01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:35.884
EXO was on here.

1716
01:07:35.946 --> 01:07:37.880
And Wanna One came last week!

1717
01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:39.485
Wanna One was here!

1718
01:07:39.556 --> 01:07:40.556
Do you know Wanna One?

1719
01:07:40.743 --> 01:07:41.766
(Of course.)

1720
01:07:41.767 --> 01:07:43.040
101 people!

1721
01:07:43.337 --> 01:07:44.905
There aren't 101 people!

1722
01:07:44.946 --> 01:07:46.316
They were chosen from 101 people.

1723
01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:47.360
It was...

1724
01:07:48.415 --> 01:07:49.415
Kang Daniel.

1725
01:07:50.423 --> 01:07:51.423
And Ji-hoon.

1726
01:07:51.493 --> 01:07:52.493
Park Ji-hoon.

1727
01:07:52.868 --> 01:07:55.110
We went to Jeonju together.

1728
01:07:55.665 --> 01:07:57.937
He remembers because it was last week!

1729
01:07:58.321 --> 01:07:59.321
No!

1730
01:07:59.352 --> 01:08:01.282
(He'll forget in a few days...)

1731
01:08:03.017 --> 01:08:04.328
Who came from EXO?

1732
01:08:04.329 --> 01:08:05.329
We had two guys.

1733
01:08:05.602 --> 01:08:06.657
Chan-yeol.

1734
01:08:06.946 --> 01:08:07.946
Soo-hwa?

1735
01:08:08.048 --> 01:08:09.342
Who's Soo-hwa!

1736
01:08:09.899 --> 01:08:10.899
Soo-ho...

1737
01:08:11.446 --> 01:08:12.446
Soo-ho!

1738
01:08:12.649 --> 01:08:13.716
I know everyone.

1739
01:08:14.376 --> 01:08:15.376
Not everyone...

1740
01:08:15.415 --> 01:08:16.415
I even studied...

1741
01:08:16.899 --> 01:08:18.165
I started studying after I got

1742
01:08:18.196 --> 01:08:19.281
a lot of bad press.

1743
01:08:19.532 --> 01:08:20.732
Through this show,

1744
01:08:21.274 --> 01:08:23.078
a celebrity in his 37th year is

1745
01:08:23.079 --> 01:08:25.321
finally learning about other celebrities.

1746
01:08:26.306 --> 01:08:29.915
(They're deep in a conversation.)

1747
01:08:31.142 --> 01:08:34.946
(Downs it.)

1748
01:08:37.227 --> 01:08:39.785
(Puts her cup where everyone can see.)

1749
01:08:39.852 --> 01:08:41.407
It's like an oasis in a desert.

1750
01:08:42.032 --> 01:08:44.246
(Over here.)

1751
01:08:44.876 --> 01:08:46.729
(She finished!)

1752
01:08:47.337 --> 01:08:49.825
(Is this cup leaking?)

1753
01:08:51.118 --> 01:08:53.109
(Just for Yu-ri...)

1754
01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:56.754
(Rice wine refill.)

1755
01:08:57.024 --> 01:08:59.384
(Ji-hye isn't saying anything.)

1756
01:09:00.610 --> 01:09:02.173
She's so quiet.

1757
01:09:02.821 --> 01:09:04.868
She doesn't normally talk much...

1758
01:09:05.657 --> 01:09:07.125
But my heart still drops a beat

1759
01:09:07.126 --> 01:09:08.493
when I think about what happened.

1760
01:09:08.563 --> 01:09:10.347
We really caught you off guard, didn't we?

1761
01:09:10.735 --> 01:09:12.773
(Never imagined Yu-ri)

1762
01:09:12.774 --> 01:09:14.487
(would come to her house.)

1763
01:09:15.962 --> 01:09:20.696
I thought Ji-hye was really pretty.

1764
01:09:21.415 --> 01:09:22.776
But she wasn't!

1765
01:09:26.024 --> 01:09:27.774
(Her father's betrayal...)

1766
01:09:27.852 --> 01:09:29.383
How could you throw me under the bus?

1767
01:09:30.329 --> 01:09:31.993
I'm sure he loves her the most!

1768
01:09:33.610 --> 01:09:35.782
I should've put on some makeup.

1769
01:09:36.313 --> 01:09:37.642
You didn't put any on?

1770
01:09:37.712 --> 01:09:38.712
Nope.

1771
01:09:39.063 --> 01:09:40.485
Your skin is so fair.

1772
01:09:40.774 --> 01:09:41.974
I hear that a lot.

1773
01:09:43.298 --> 01:09:45.205
(Honest.)

1774
01:09:45.329 --> 01:09:47.508
(My wife is so pretty.)

1775
01:09:50.454 --> 01:09:54.334
I'm an old fan of JTBC's Son Suk-hee.

1776
01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:58.626
I was even in his fan club before.

1777
01:09:58.751 --> 01:10:01.751
(Comes out as a fan.)

1778
01:10:02.110 --> 01:10:04.295
He played a huge role in TV

1779
01:10:04.517 --> 01:10:06.183
during the mass protests.

1780
01:10:06.923 --> 01:10:08.423
I would like to tell him

1781
01:10:08.931 --> 01:10:11.462
that he did a great job.

1782
01:10:11.946 --> 01:10:13.013
Why don't you...

1783
01:10:14.461 --> 01:10:15.954
Should I leave him a message?

1784
01:10:19.642 --> 01:10:20.798
Hello.

1785
01:10:21.329 --> 01:10:23.501
I used to go watch

1786
01:10:23.845 --> 01:10:25.470
100 Minutes Debates all the time.

1787
01:10:27.517 --> 01:10:28.860
Please keep up

1788
01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:31.928
your hard work for our country.

1789
01:10:32.032 --> 01:10:33.032
Thank you.

1790
01:10:33.845 --> 01:10:36.829
(Just couldn't hide that she's a fan.)

1791
01:10:36.884 --> 01:10:37.884
Sir...

1792
01:10:38.446 --> 01:10:40.923
If you hear about how she was

1793
01:10:41.423 --> 01:10:42.489
in his fan club,

1794
01:10:42.587 --> 01:10:43.854
don't you get jealous?

1795
01:10:43.907 --> 01:10:44.907
Nope.

1796
01:10:45.329 --> 01:10:46.329
Not at all.

1797
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:47.470
Not even a little?

1798
01:10:47.501 --> 01:10:48.501
Nope.

1799
01:10:51.329 --> 01:10:52.587
I'm sorry I asked...

1800
01:10:53.610 --> 01:10:55.360
After 20 years of marriage...

1801
01:10:57.595 --> 01:10:59.121
His sister is your sister in law now.

1802
01:10:59.212 --> 01:11:00.922
But at first, she didn't tell you

1803
01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:02.110
that he was her sister

1804
01:11:02.142 --> 01:11:03.304
and you went to meet him.

1805
01:11:03.345 --> 01:11:05.354
Who was there first?

1806
01:11:05.431 --> 01:11:06.649
I came later.

1807
01:11:07.071 --> 01:11:08.414
I went because my friend said

1808
01:11:08.415 --> 01:11:09.977
she wanted to set me up on a date.

1809
01:11:10.095 --> 01:11:11.563
When he came in...

1810
01:11:12.392 --> 01:11:14.858
That's when she said he's my brother.

1811
01:11:14.907 --> 01:11:16.174
I couldn't leave...

1812
01:11:16.493 --> 01:11:18.287
There wasn't much that I could do.

1813
01:11:18.727 --> 01:11:20.461
It's not like you can say,

1814
01:11:20.501 --> 01:11:22.034
I'm out of here, right?

1815
01:11:23.251 --> 01:11:24.251
Be honest.

1816
01:11:24.892 --> 01:11:26.126
As soon as I walked in,

1817
01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:27.753
she knew I was the one.

1818
01:11:28.845 --> 01:11:30.563
(Admits it.)

1819
01:11:30.626 --> 01:11:31.626
Really?

1820
01:11:32.501 --> 01:11:33.501
Why?

1821
01:11:34.298 --> 01:11:35.575
I regret it too...

1822
01:11:37.767 --> 01:11:40.433
He perfectly fit my ideal type of a guy.

1823
01:11:40.493 --> 01:11:41.663
So I thought he was the one.

1824
01:11:41.798 --> 01:11:43.602
What is your ideal type?

1825
01:11:45.102 --> 01:11:46.360
Weirdly...

1826
01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:48.253
Ever since high school,

1827
01:11:48.313 --> 01:11:50.008
I liked Joo Hyun, the actor.

1828
01:11:50.173 --> 01:11:52.295
(They do kind of look alike.)

1829
01:11:52.681 --> 01:11:54.650
(Impersonation.)

1830
01:11:54.735 --> 01:11:56.164
He does look like a nice person.

1831
01:11:56.165 --> 01:11:57.165
And warm.

1832
01:11:57.837 --> 01:11:58.837
How about you?

1833
01:11:59.501 --> 01:12:00.751
When you walked in...

1834
01:12:00.915 --> 01:12:01.915
But...

1835
01:12:02.282 --> 01:12:03.626
It's a bit complicated.

1836
01:12:03.665 --> 01:12:07.267
That was when he couldn't get married.

1837
01:12:07.985 --> 01:12:09.087
Can I tell them?

1838
01:12:10.774 --> 01:12:12.656
He was a wanted man

1839
01:12:12.657 --> 01:12:14.610
for protesting...

1840
01:12:17.829 --> 01:12:19.572
But that was the norm back then.

1841
01:12:21.446 --> 01:12:23.913
That's why we couldn't get married...

1842
01:12:24.048 --> 01:12:25.673
I see.

1843
01:12:25.829 --> 01:12:27.719
Meeting someone to plan

1844
01:12:27.813 --> 01:12:31.156
a future together wasn't possible.

1845
01:12:31.376 --> 01:12:32.797
He could've thought it was

1846
01:12:32.798 --> 01:12:33.864
an extravagance.

1847
01:12:34.446 --> 01:12:36.654
He wasn't ready.

1848
01:12:37.267 --> 01:12:38.470
That was then.

1849
01:12:38.610 --> 01:12:40.875
Your sister didn't tell you anything?

1850
01:12:40.876 --> 01:12:42.326
No, she told me

1851
01:12:42.493 --> 01:12:43.767
it was a blind date.

1852
01:12:44.485 --> 01:12:46.230
(Hesitant.)

1853
01:12:46.392 --> 01:12:48.791
She told me a lot about my wife.

1854
01:12:49.001 --> 01:12:50.001
I heard...

1855
01:12:50.267 --> 01:12:52.884
That she just broke up

1856
01:12:53.048 --> 01:12:54.048
with her boyfriend

1857
01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:56.110
and she was hurt...

1858
01:12:57.220 --> 01:12:59.445
(Way too honest.)

1859
01:12:59.509 --> 01:13:00.997
It was so beautiful until now...

1860
01:13:04.142 --> 01:13:05.142
So I was just going to...

1861
01:13:06.204 --> 01:13:08.804
Go meet her once since my sister asked...

1862
01:13:09.610 --> 01:13:11.002
Then let her be.

1863
01:13:12.368 --> 01:13:14.165
Then were you the one who hung on to him

1864
01:13:14.329 --> 01:13:15.438
and stayed in contact?

1865
01:13:15.876 --> 01:13:17.943
Well his sister kept telling me

1866
01:13:17.985 --> 01:13:19.052
to see him again

1867
01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:21.720
and as I did, things just happened

1868
01:13:21.876 --> 01:13:22.985
naturally.

1869
01:13:23.759 --> 01:13:25.735
How long did you date then?

1870
01:13:25.899 --> 01:13:27.922
We dated for about 1 year and a half

1871
01:13:27.923 --> 01:13:29.618
then got married.

1872
01:13:29.821 --> 01:13:31.516
But cell phones didn't exist back then.

1873
01:13:31.517 --> 01:13:32.883
(How did you talk to each other?)

1874
01:13:32.884 --> 01:13:34.555
His sister played a big part.

1875
01:13:35.634 --> 01:13:37.485
If we wanted to meet...

1876
01:13:38.142 --> 01:13:40.970
Plus, minus was important.

1877
01:13:41.134 --> 01:13:42.134
What's that?

1878
01:13:42.235 --> 01:13:44.142
If we wanted to meet on January 3rd,

1879
01:13:44.438 --> 01:13:45.837
our phones could've been tapped.

1880
01:13:46.477 --> 01:13:48.267
We say we'll meet on January 5th

1881
01:13:48.462 --> 01:13:49.657
but agreed to subtract 2

1882
01:13:49.735 --> 01:13:51.173
on every number that ends in 5.

1883
01:13:52.204 --> 01:13:53.876
If we wanted to meet on 12 O'clock,

1884
01:13:54.407 --> 01:13:56.832
we would've added 3 hours to it.

1885
01:13:57.376 --> 01:13:59.148
That's how we met.

1886
01:13:59.696 --> 01:14:01.220
It was that bad?

1887
01:14:01.493 --> 01:14:02.876
That's how it was back then.

1888
01:14:03.688 --> 01:14:05.931
That sounds like a movie.

1889
01:14:06.423 --> 01:14:08.797
It's like a plot of a drama!

1890
01:14:08.845 --> 01:14:10.111
Weren't you scared?

1891
01:14:11.345 --> 01:14:12.782
I was young.

1892
01:14:12.829 --> 01:14:14.151
I didn't mind.

1893
01:14:14.423 --> 01:14:15.727
Did he propose to you?

1894
01:14:16.001 --> 01:14:17.001
From who?

1895
01:14:17.032 --> 01:14:18.032
Your husband.

1896
01:14:18.368 --> 01:14:20.001
He didn't propose to you?

1897
01:14:20.806 --> 01:14:21.806
Well...

1898
01:14:22.462 --> 01:14:24.301
I proposed to him...

1899
01:14:25.602 --> 01:14:27.302
You proposed to him?

1900
01:14:27.392 --> 01:14:29.306
He couldn't get married.

1901
01:14:29.384 --> 01:14:31.412
But I proposed anyways.

1902
01:14:33.298 --> 01:14:34.688
It just happened.

1903
01:14:35.462 --> 01:14:38.322
(A very rare thing back in the days.)

1904
01:14:38.501 --> 01:14:40.701
Everyone has to get married at some point.

1905
01:14:41.313 --> 01:14:42.313
So...

1906
01:14:43.384 --> 01:14:45.219
(Dad, be careful.)

1907
01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:47.117
She said she'll take care of me

1908
01:14:47.118 --> 01:14:48.118
financially.

1909
01:14:49.501 --> 01:14:50.501
Dad...

1910
01:14:50.821 --> 01:14:52.938
(He married her for money?)

1911
01:14:53.024 --> 01:14:54.644
Where did the romance go?

1912
01:14:55.102 --> 01:14:56.889
(Joking.)

1913
01:14:56.890 --> 01:14:58.764
Say what you really mean!

1914
01:14:59.009 --> 01:15:00.009
I loved her.

1915
01:15:02.063 --> 01:15:03.860
You guys are very brave.

1916
01:15:04.704 --> 01:15:07.056
She's perfect for me.

1917
01:15:08.032 --> 01:15:09.665
What a beautiful ending.

1918
01:15:11.446 --> 01:15:12.775
We're happy now.

1919
01:15:12.829 --> 01:15:14.829
(We're happy after overcoming)

1920
01:15:14.852 --> 01:15:15.945
(every obstacles.)

1921
01:15:16.235 --> 01:15:19.118
Even during the toughest time...

1922
01:15:20.415 --> 01:15:22.055
With their love and trust for each other,

1923
01:15:22.056 --> 01:15:23.384
they ended up together.

1924
01:15:24.946 --> 01:15:27.062
The past has become a story to tell

1925
01:15:27.345 --> 01:15:30.078
their daughters while drinking rice wine.

1926
01:15:32.571 --> 01:15:34.616
(Proud.)

1927
01:15:34.751 --> 01:15:37.606
Our kids are all grown up now

1928
01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:39.040
without any troubles.

1929
01:15:39.157 --> 01:15:41.281
Since they're both seniors,

1930
01:15:41.282 --> 01:15:43.821
all I want now is for them to be able to

1931
01:15:43.907 --> 01:15:45.041
get a job easily.

1932
01:15:45.595 --> 01:15:47.579
What do you want to do?

1933
01:15:48.649 --> 01:15:49.649
Just...

1934
01:15:50.384 --> 01:15:52.384
Something related to my major.

1935
01:15:53.313 --> 01:15:54.513
What's your major?

1936
01:15:55.329 --> 01:15:57.548
Electric engineering.

1937
01:15:58.282 --> 01:15:59.751
Ji-hye, what do you want to be?

1938
01:16:00.501 --> 01:16:01.501
I...

1939
01:16:02.259 --> 01:16:03.846
Don't have a definite plan.

1940
01:16:04.587 --> 01:16:05.828
I just wanted to be rich since

1941
01:16:05.829 --> 01:16:06.829
I was a kid.

1942
01:16:08.454 --> 01:16:09.985
Let's assume that you did.

1943
01:16:10.392 --> 01:16:12.157
What 3 things do you want to do ?

1944
01:16:13.352 --> 01:16:14.352
Travel.

1945
01:16:14.829 --> 01:16:15.829
Yes, travel.

1946
01:16:16.431 --> 01:16:17.875
I want to buy land.

1947
01:16:20.063 --> 01:16:21.859
(Ji-hye wants real estates.)

1948
01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:23.040
I like that idea.

1949
01:16:23.065 --> 01:16:24.096
Then what?

1950
01:16:24.159 --> 01:16:25.425
Then...

1951
01:16:25.550 --> 01:16:27.526
Plant some trees.

1952
01:16:28.846 --> 01:16:30.276
I want to grow trees.

1953
01:16:30.925 --> 01:16:32.974
Not raise buildings?

1954
01:16:33.050 --> 01:16:35.271
I just want to grow trees.

1955
01:16:35.378 --> 01:16:37.454
(Embarrassed.)

1956
01:16:37.682 --> 01:16:38.682
Which ones?

1957
01:16:38.729 --> 01:16:40.320
Apple trees and date trees.

1958
01:16:40.753 --> 01:16:42.471
Fruit trees...

1959
01:16:43.503 --> 01:16:45.612
Then sell the apples...

1960
01:16:45.878 --> 01:16:47.241
And earn millions of dollars...

1961
01:16:48.487 --> 01:16:49.673
Then buy more land!

1962
01:16:50.917 --> 01:16:53.190
Make half of Korea yours.

1963
01:16:53.479 --> 01:16:55.355
(He's too realistic too understand.)

1964
01:16:55.503 --> 01:16:57.206
Travel or buy land first?

1965
01:16:57.393 --> 01:16:58.393
Buy land first!

1966
01:16:59.581 --> 01:17:01.210
The price always goes up...

1967
01:17:01.479 --> 01:17:04.695
(So she can plant more trees.)

1968
01:17:05.081 --> 01:17:08.835
(And the third plan?)

1969
01:17:10.315 --> 01:17:11.449
My mom and dad...

1970
01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:15.097
I had everything I wanted.

1971
01:17:15.268 --> 01:17:17.689
I have so much to pay back for.

1972
01:17:17.932 --> 01:17:20.511
I tried to add everything up recently...

1973
01:17:22.596 --> 01:17:23.596
And?

1974
01:17:23.729 --> 01:17:24.956
It was too much...

1975
01:17:25.050 --> 01:17:26.749
Just thinking that is amazing.

1976
01:17:26.862 --> 01:17:28.490
That's so nice.

1977
01:17:29.956 --> 01:17:31.548
She's graduating soon.

1978
01:17:31.971 --> 01:17:33.971
Maybe that's why she did that.

1979
01:17:35.636 --> 01:17:36.893
We don't need anything.

1980
01:17:40.034 --> 01:17:41.470
(This couple reminisce)

1981
01:17:41.471 --> 01:17:43.676
(the old times...)

1982
01:17:44.784 --> 01:17:46.799
How long did you guys date?

1983
01:17:46.964 --> 01:17:49.159
We dated...

1984
01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:50.800
For 1 year.

1985
01:17:51.393 --> 01:17:53.017
I'm a bit confused...

1986
01:17:53.018 --> 01:17:55.243
We were just friends at first...

1987
01:17:55.745 --> 01:17:57.401
And things happened so fast.

1988
01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:59.362
I want to know what happened!

1989
01:17:59.589 --> 01:18:02.074
What made you decide to marry him?

1990
01:18:02.471 --> 01:18:04.573
We went to the same church...

1991
01:18:05.214 --> 01:18:06.471
I go to church too!

1992
01:18:07.175 --> 01:18:08.308
Is he older than you?

1993
01:18:09.604 --> 01:18:10.604
He's younger than me.

1994
01:18:12.643 --> 01:18:14.931
And you met him at church?

1995
01:18:14.932 --> 01:18:16.744
I'm only a little bit older.

1996
01:18:16.761 --> 01:18:17.761
7 months...

1997
01:18:17.807 --> 01:18:18.807
7 months?

1998
01:18:18.886 --> 01:18:21.397
That's pretty much the same age in Korea!

1999
01:18:21.471 --> 01:18:23.138
Did you hear that?

2000
01:18:23.167 --> 01:18:24.167
Friends!

2001
01:18:24.276 --> 01:18:25.459
No, noona!

2002
01:18:26.573 --> 01:18:29.846
(Oh, Jason...)

2003
01:18:42.339 --> 01:18:44.468
(Funny...)

2004
01:18:44.469 --> 01:18:45.469
That was quick...

2005
01:19:11.682 --> 01:19:16.511
I was just over 30 back then.

2006
01:19:17.104 --> 01:19:20.190
I was already thinking about marriage.

2007
01:19:20.956 --> 01:19:22.588
But I didn't know if I could trust him

2008
01:19:22.589 --> 01:19:23.789
when we first met.

2009
01:19:24.886 --> 01:19:26.542
But I was able to see that eventually.

2010
01:19:26.682 --> 01:19:28.749
As you became friends with him.

2011
01:19:28.807 --> 01:19:30.905
We were able to have deep conversations.

2012
01:19:32.589 --> 01:19:33.722
As friends first,

2013
01:19:33.823 --> 01:19:35.245
they eventually became a couple

2014
01:19:35.362 --> 01:19:37.370
after being able to relate to each other.

2015
01:19:38.604 --> 01:19:40.348
What did you like about him the most?

2016
01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:43.159
I already knew that...

2017
01:19:43.690 --> 01:19:45.567
He's a hard worker.

2018
01:19:45.729 --> 01:19:48.050
I thought he was a good person at first.

2019
01:19:48.315 --> 01:19:49.549
He looks like a nice person.

2020
01:19:50.292 --> 01:19:51.292
He's honest.

2021
01:19:52.698 --> 01:19:53.698
And...

2022
01:19:53.839 --> 01:19:57.822
I wasn't attracted to him at all at first.

2023
01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:00.792
Then I started feeling attracted to him.

2024
01:20:00.823 --> 01:20:01.823
After a while?

2025
01:20:01.854 --> 01:20:02.854
Yes.

2026
01:20:02.901 --> 01:20:03.901
That's falling in love.

2027
01:20:03.956 --> 01:20:05.780
I totally understand now.

2028
01:20:06.565 --> 01:20:08.783
Personalities does matter in a marriage,

2029
01:20:08.784 --> 01:20:10.237
but there are other factors such as

2030
01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:11.791
finances and how we lived our lives

2031
01:20:11.792 --> 01:20:13.047
until now.

2032
01:20:13.518 --> 01:20:15.448
I gave up on finances back then!

2033
01:20:18.448 --> 01:20:20.811
I thought I could just earn the money.

2034
01:20:21.565 --> 01:20:23.775
If you really love each other,

2035
01:20:23.776 --> 01:20:26.425
other things don't really matter...

2036
01:20:26.675 --> 01:20:28.875
If I were to advice women who are

2037
01:20:28.886 --> 01:20:31.394
dating foreigners...

2038
01:20:31.948 --> 01:20:33.417
Koreans...

2039
01:20:33.909 --> 01:20:37.017
Save money to get ready for marriage.

2040
01:20:37.018 --> 01:20:40.529
But unlike Koreans, they don't.

2041
01:20:42.502 --> 01:20:43.503
Exactly!

2042
01:20:43.995 --> 01:20:47.502
And their parents don't think about

2043
01:20:47.503 --> 01:20:50.478
helping us out to buy our house.

2044
01:20:51.378 --> 01:20:52.963
You have to do everything

2045
01:20:52.964 --> 01:20:55.425
with your own money.

2046
01:20:55.831 --> 01:20:56.831
And...

2047
01:20:56.932 --> 01:20:58.767
Some people, even if they don't have

2048
01:20:58.768 --> 01:21:00.035
any money saved up,

2049
01:21:00.331 --> 01:21:02.603
they're capable of doing so.

2050
01:21:02.737 --> 01:21:04.549
If they want to save up

2051
01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:07.350
instead of enjoying their lives every day,

2052
01:21:07.542 --> 01:21:08.542
it will help.

2053
01:21:09.159 --> 01:21:10.622
That's a good advice.

2054
01:21:11.159 --> 01:21:12.401
Why did you choose marry her?

2055
01:21:13.917 --> 01:21:15.408
What do you like about her?

2056
01:21:16.276 --> 01:21:17.276
She's smart.

2057
01:21:18.206 --> 01:21:19.206
And...

2058
01:21:20.557 --> 01:21:21.557
She's pretty.

2059
01:21:21.581 --> 01:21:22.581
Be honest!

2060
01:21:22.737 --> 01:21:25.745
(How all husbands are...)

2061
01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:27.940
He thinks everything about her

2062
01:21:28.003 --> 01:21:29.457
is pretty

2063
01:21:29.458 --> 01:21:31.954
including how she acts or talks.

2064
01:21:32.956 --> 01:21:33.956
Apple of my eyes...

2065
01:21:34.018 --> 01:21:36.685
You both are to each other!

2066
01:21:36.721 --> 01:21:38.477
I can see how much they love each other.

2067
01:21:38.674 --> 01:21:40.275
Were your parents okay

2068
01:21:40.307 --> 01:21:42.407
with your marriage?

2069
01:21:42.675 --> 01:21:44.221
They weren't happy at first...

2070
01:21:45.011 --> 01:21:46.011
I'm the only daughter

2071
01:21:46.065 --> 01:21:47.065
and they were scared that

2072
01:21:47.136 --> 01:21:48.456
I'll move overseas.

2073
01:21:48.761 --> 01:21:51.768
But he's really good with kids.

2074
01:21:52.221 --> 01:21:53.564
And with his job,

2075
01:21:53.565 --> 01:21:55.299
he has a lot of free time.

2076
01:21:55.565 --> 01:21:57.425
He's really good with our kid.

2077
01:21:57.518 --> 01:21:59.852
So my parents are really happy now.

2078
01:22:00.409 --> 01:22:03.300
He's still watching his kid!

2079
01:22:03.386 --> 01:22:04.386
I know!

2080
01:22:04.425 --> 01:22:06.486
I completely forgot about my kid...

2081
01:22:06.870 --> 01:22:08.494
Sun-hee's mom isn't concerned

2082
01:22:08.495 --> 01:22:09.495
with her child.

2083
01:22:09.518 --> 01:22:11.764
She talking about her philosophy...

2084
01:22:13.253 --> 01:22:15.472
While he's watching their kid.

2085
01:22:16.511 --> 01:22:18.080
He's such a nice person.

2086
01:22:19.175 --> 01:22:21.308
Everything she imagines, happen!

2087
01:22:21.831 --> 01:22:22.831
Right?

2088
01:22:22.909 --> 01:22:26.222
She thought she'd eventually meet you,

2089
01:22:26.223 --> 01:22:27.223
and she did.

2090
01:22:27.425 --> 01:22:29.439
She always thought she'd marry

2091
01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:30.440
a foreigner,

2092
01:22:30.518 --> 01:22:31.518
and she did.

2093
01:22:33.003 --> 01:22:34.628
They look happy, don't they?

2094
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:37.715
(Very happy with love.)

2095
01:22:37.878 --> 01:22:40.144
An American man and a Korean woman

2096
01:22:40.151 --> 01:22:41.547
fell in love.

2097
01:22:42.026 --> 01:22:43.767
They recognized their differences

2098
01:22:43.768 --> 01:22:45.239
and became  lovers.

2099
01:22:45.604 --> 01:22:47.675
And with their beautiful daughter, Sun-hee

2100
01:22:47.737 --> 01:22:49.424
they became a family.

2101
01:22:51.451 --> 01:22:52.466
We have a segment

2102
01:22:52.467 --> 01:22:53.888
where you guys need to compliment

2103
01:22:53.889 --> 01:22:55.193
and say your disappointments.

2104
01:22:55.545 --> 01:22:57.212
What are you thankful and disappointed

2105
01:22:57.295 --> 01:22:58.362
by your spouse?

2106
01:22:58.951 --> 01:22:59.951
Compliments?

2107
01:23:03.951 --> 01:23:06.029
Jin-hee...

2108
01:23:10.029 --> 01:23:11.824
For taking care of Sun-hee.

2109
01:23:15.389 --> 01:23:16.744
He said, she's the best mother.

2110
01:23:18.045 --> 01:23:19.154
And the second?

2111
01:23:19.748 --> 01:23:20.748
She's a hard...

2112
01:23:21.178 --> 01:23:22.178
Worker?

2113
01:23:23.061 --> 01:23:24.428
A hard worker.

2114
01:23:28.717 --> 01:23:31.502
(You know what I'm saying?)

2115
01:23:33.998 --> 01:23:36.423
(The best compliment.)

2116
01:23:41.076 --> 01:23:42.358
This body language is universal.

2117
01:23:44.592 --> 01:23:45.592
He understood.

2118
01:23:45.983 --> 01:23:46.983
Then...

2119
01:23:50.326 --> 01:23:51.570
Is this a restaurant?

2120
01:23:51.756 --> 01:23:53.006
We have a complaint!

2121
01:23:53.233 --> 01:23:54.498
I want to speak to a manager!

2122
01:23:55.529 --> 01:23:57.226
(His Complaints!)

2123
01:24:01.412 --> 01:24:02.479
Just like you...

2124
01:24:08.139 --> 01:24:09.139
I'm...

2125
01:24:09.826 --> 01:24:11.844
Very frugal.

2126
01:24:12.818 --> 01:24:14.309
But that's good!

2127
01:24:14.733 --> 01:24:15.733
Of course.

2128
01:24:15.811 --> 01:24:16.944
And the last one.

2129
01:24:22.342 --> 01:24:25.027
(Jason's unafraid.)

2130
01:24:25.389 --> 01:24:27.029
A language...

2131
01:24:27.436 --> 01:24:29.302
Just can't be taught easily!

2132
01:24:29.334 --> 01:24:32.182
(Their love even beat a language barrier.)

2133
01:24:32.295 --> 01:24:34.276
That was much quicker...

2134
01:24:34.670 --> 01:24:36.070
Than his compliments.

2135
01:24:37.772 --> 01:24:39.474
What would you like to compliment him on?

2136
01:24:39.811 --> 01:24:40.811
Compliments!

2137
01:24:41.373 --> 01:24:43.325
After school, he comes straight home

2138
01:24:43.326 --> 01:24:45.379
to see the baby.

2139
01:24:47.022 --> 01:24:48.440
That's the best.

2140
01:24:48.498 --> 01:24:49.498
Of course.

2141
01:24:49.748 --> 01:24:52.914
I make a lot of mistakes...

2142
01:24:53.459 --> 01:24:56.050
But he's always there for me.

2143
01:24:56.397 --> 01:24:57.506
Is he understanding?

2144
01:24:57.545 --> 01:24:58.545
Yes.

2145
01:24:58.576 --> 01:24:59.725
All the time...

2146
01:25:00.514 --> 01:25:01.904
And your complaints.

2147
01:25:02.389 --> 01:25:03.389
Complaints...

2148
01:25:03.912 --> 01:25:06.312
I think he's slow sometimes...

2149
01:25:09.037 --> 01:25:10.756
Koreans are very impatient.

2150
01:25:10.873 --> 01:25:12.675
I should take longer to get ready

2151
01:25:12.676 --> 01:25:14.262
as a woman...

2152
01:25:14.334 --> 01:25:15.334
And...

2153
01:25:15.637 --> 01:25:17.237
Complaints, complaints, complaints...

2154
01:25:17.825 --> 01:25:19.253
You don't have to say anything,

2155
01:25:19.254 --> 01:25:20.340
if there isn't any.

2156
01:25:20.473 --> 01:25:21.473
I have too many.

2157
01:25:22.747 --> 01:25:24.463
She can't choose.

2158
01:25:28.879 --> 01:25:29.879
And...

2159
01:25:30.184 --> 01:25:31.464
If he were going to help me,

2160
01:25:31.465 --> 01:25:33.772
I wish he'd help me until the end.

2161
01:25:34.293 --> 01:25:36.300
Could you write the subtitles in English

2162
01:25:36.301 --> 01:25:37.301
for him?

2163
01:25:37.465 --> 01:25:39.207
I don't know how to say it in English.

2164
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:40.379
Did you understand that?

2165
01:25:42.161 --> 01:25:43.161
(Confused.)

2166
01:25:43.168 --> 01:25:44.575
We got you covered.

2167
01:25:44.645 --> 01:25:46.184
He'll be able to understand.

2168
01:25:52.230 --> 01:25:55.556
(Subtitles just for Jason.)

2169
01:25:56.083 --> 01:25:57.958
What's difficult about living in Korea?

2170
01:26:21.895 --> 01:26:22.895
I see...

2171
01:26:23.145 --> 01:26:24.566
That's the difference between

2172
01:26:24.567 --> 01:26:26.986
a first and a second language.

2173
01:26:27.723 --> 01:26:29.910
Did any of the racial bias

2174
01:26:29.911 --> 01:26:32.239
give you any hard time?

2175
01:26:41.449 --> 01:26:42.880
And this man...

2176
01:27:02.606 --> 01:27:04.806
Few people just get angry at him

2177
01:27:04.848 --> 01:27:07.111
for being a foreigner.

2178
01:27:07.583 --> 01:27:08.583
I see...

2179
01:27:08.661 --> 01:27:09.661
Was he...

2180
01:27:10.145 --> 01:27:11.145
Drunk?

2181
01:27:40.981 --> 01:27:42.957
(Totally inappropriate.)

2182
01:27:43.059 --> 01:27:45.323
Other Koreans won't understand that either.

2183
01:27:46.442 --> 01:27:48.770
She's the weird one.

2184
01:27:48.809 --> 01:27:51.131
(Upset.)

2185
01:27:51.286 --> 01:27:53.387
What are your dreams?

2186
01:28:10.090 --> 01:28:11.090
Like her mom...

2187
01:28:11.208 --> 01:28:12.208
To you guys...

2188
01:28:12.926 --> 01:28:13.926
Sun-hee must be

2189
01:28:14.395 --> 01:28:16.786
a good middle ground in your marriage.

2190
01:28:16.911 --> 01:28:17.911
Yes...

2191
01:28:17.989 --> 01:28:19.239
When things get tough...

2192
01:28:19.458 --> 01:28:20.458
Or lonely...

2193
01:28:21.458 --> 01:28:23.145
You two will always be connected

2194
01:28:23.583 --> 01:28:25.873
through Sun-hee.

2195
01:28:27.372 --> 01:28:29.950
We'll do the dishes.

2196
01:28:31.254 --> 01:28:33.661
We'll do the dishes.

2197
01:28:34.215 --> 01:28:36.083
Yu-ri, the oldest daughter for the day.

2198
01:28:40.395 --> 01:28:43.214
You look like you know what you're doing!

2199
01:28:43.262 --> 01:28:44.648
I do it a lot at home.

2200
01:28:44.668 --> 01:28:45.668
The dishes?

2201
01:28:46.918 --> 01:28:49.542
I do the dishes and cook.

2202
01:28:49.918 --> 01:28:51.606
Sun-hee's new family, Sunny

2203
01:28:52.004 --> 01:28:54.259
finishes her night with doing the dishes.

2204
01:28:57.270 --> 01:29:00.194
(Kyung-kyu cleans up too.)

2205
01:29:01.559 --> 01:29:04.860
(Photo time.)

2206
01:29:06.426 --> 01:29:08.489
A meal that offered us a meal

2207
01:29:08.645 --> 01:29:10.614
#72 and #73

2208
01:29:10.926 --> 01:29:13.719
were born in Hwaseodong.

2209
01:29:16.028 --> 01:29:17.379
Let's Have Dinner Together.

2210
01:29:17.567 --> 01:29:18.793
Good luck!

2211
01:29:20.442 --> 01:29:21.527

01:29:36.958 --> 01:29:37.958
(Confused.)

2218
01:29:38.333 --> 01:29:40.215

Kim Yu-Na!

2220

Yu-Na!

2221
01:29:43.731 --> 01:29:45.114
I thought that was a sheep!

2222
01:29:45.176 --> 01:29:47.325
(Nope.)

2223
01:29:47.410 --> 01:29:48.979
(King of Music, K-Will.)

2224
01:29:48.980 --> 01:29:50.177
(Queen of music, So-you.)

The Winter Olympics will be in Pyeongchang.

2226
01:29:53.223 --> 01:29:54.605
What are you guys doing here?

2227
01:29:54.691 --> 01:29:57.064

Jinbumyeon, Pyeongchang.

2229
01:29:59.848 --> 01:30:01.238
We've never been to a myeon!

2230
01:30:01.262 --> 01:30:03.220
(Myeon: Smallest classification of cities.)

2231
01:30:03.221 --> 01:30:04.763
This is the strongest rain we've had!

2232
01:30:04.957 --> 01:30:08.473
(A fantastic duet)

2233
01:30:08.613 --> 01:30:10.808
(with Pyeongchang's fresh air.)

2234
01:30:11.019 --> 01:30:12.605
I won as the best singer

2235
01:30:12.793 --> 01:30:14.193
for the rainy season.

2236
01:30:14.777 --> 01:30:15.777
You're KCM!

2237
01:30:15.926 --> 01:30:17.102
I'm not KCM!

2238
01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:18.566
I'm K-Will!

2239
01:30:18.863 --> 01:30:20.366
I've been K-Will for 10 years!

2240
01:30:20.457 --> 01:30:23.076
Is that Dae-sung?

2241
01:30:23.144 --> 01:30:24.695
I'm K-Will...

2242
01:30:24.816 --> 01:30:26.628
(A singer for 10 years...)

2243
01:30:26.629 --> 01:30:27.888
I'm K-Will!

2244
01:30:28.441 --> 01:30:29.699
Heongseong is famous for beef.

2245
01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:31.488
I want beef...

2246
01:30:31.574 --> 01:30:33.691
(So-you's obsessed with food.)

2247
01:30:33.754 --> 01:30:35.106
(Even knows local delicacies.)

2248
01:30:35.269 --> 01:30:36.480
I don't know what that is.

2249
01:30:36.848 --> 01:30:39.144
(A big eater in a different class!)

2250
01:30:40.941 --> 01:30:43.153
(Awestruck.)

2251
01:30:43.238 --> 01:30:44.734
I've always wanted to do that.

2252
01:30:45.723 --> 01:30:47.308
(Rings a doorbell with high hopes.)

2253
01:30:47.363 --> 01:30:48.967
Did you eat yet?

2254
01:30:49.551 --> 01:30:51.328
There's nothing to eat...

2255
01:30:51.329 --> 01:30:53.125
(They're nice, but have no food!)

2256
01:30:54.762 --> 01:30:56.534
I'm K-Will, a singer...

2257
01:30:56.629 --> 01:30:59.339
I dare ask if I can have a meal

2258
01:30:59.340 --> 01:31:01.340
in this friendly neighborhood.

2259
01:31:01.379 --> 01:31:03.223
I'm K-Will, a singer.

2260
01:31:03.582 --> 01:31:05.104
We were soaked by the rain.

2261
01:31:05.105 --> 01:31:08.166
We're desperate for a meal.

2262
01:31:08.551 --> 01:31:10.019
Do you have to ask your parents?

2263
01:31:10.098 --> 01:31:12.266
There's a thing called telephone!

2264
01:31:12.613 --> 01:31:14.526
It's not up to me...

2265
01:31:14.691 --> 01:31:16.129
It's not a success or a fail.

2266
01:31:16.183 --> 01:31:18.882
(Will they successfully get a meal?)

2267
01:31:21.832 --> 01:31:23.262
It was so nice to see.

2268
01:31:24.191 --> 01:31:27.012
I had a great meal.

2269
01:31:27.402 --> 01:31:29.906
I sympathized with them...

2270
01:31:31.098 --> 01:31:34.712
Sunny went to Sun-hee's house.

2271
01:31:36.723 --> 01:31:38.989
New dreams of two famils in Suwon,

2272
01:31:39.098 --> 01:31:41.164
a city of King Jungjo's dreams.

2273
01:31:43.504 --> 01:31:45.971
Would you like to joins us for dinner

2274
01:31:46.122 --> 01:31:49.744
and talk about your dreams?
