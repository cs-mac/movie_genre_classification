2
00:00:29,582 --> 00:00:31,277
Very well.

3
00:00:32,744 --> 00:00:35,830
I will release the Goguryeoans.

4
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:40,398
But remember.

5
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:48,470
If Yingzhou falls into the hands of Tang,
your people won`t be safe whever they turn.

6
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:55,919
I know that you`re gathering them back together
to establish an autonomous state like we did.

7
00:00:55,919 --> 00:01:02,177
Yingzhou must be protected
if only to make that happen.

8
00:01:02,177 --> 00:01:07,019
You and I must join hands and work together.

9
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:14,342
If you`re concerned about us betraying you,
I assure you that will never happen.

10
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:18,855
It`s Geumland.

11
00:01:20,978 --> 00:01:21,978
Come on in.

12
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:30,604
Khitan soldiers are coming.

13
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,932
Khitan soldiers?

14
00:01:34,902 --> 00:01:36,556
It`s General Li Kaigu.

15
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:39,164
Li Kaigu?

16
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:49,221
I`ve come for the King.

17
00:01:49,221 --> 00:01:50,549
Clear the way.

18
00:01:51,493 --> 00:01:55,594
He has been informed,
so wait here.

19
00:01:56,761 --> 00:02:02,410
This is our country and we will do as we please!
Don`t tell us what to do!

20
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,992
Be quiet, you blasted fool.

21
00:02:04,993 --> 00:02:08,241
Stop yelling in the middle of the night.

22
00:02:08,564 --> 00:02:10,990
What? "Blasted fool"?

23
00:02:11,603 --> 00:02:16,585
Who do you think you`re talking to?
I`m a general now....

24
00:02:16,586 --> 00:02:18,935
a general of the Khitan mobile forces!

25
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:21,928
What? A general?

26
00:02:22,381 --> 00:02:26,806
That`s right, a general!

27
00:02:27,378 --> 00:02:30,450
Do you know who I am?

28
00:02:32,005 --> 00:02:34,823
I`m the Wolf, the Wolf of Mt. Madu!

29
00:02:35,384 --> 00:02:37,839
What, a wolf?

30
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:41,611
You look more like a dog.

31
00:02:42,064 --> 00:02:43,064
What?

32
00:02:43,844 --> 00:02:49,921
It`s funny you should say that
because you look like a dog.

33
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:55,217
You must be that thief from Mt.Madu that I heard about.

34
00:02:55,913 --> 00:02:59,242
What? A Thief?

35
00:02:59,242 --> 00:03:00,903
You punk!

36
00:03:04,402 --> 00:03:07,543
Darn!Tungso.

37
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:14,000
We are the brave Turkic warriers!

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,787
Silence!

39
00:03:16,207 --> 00:03:19,059
Be quiet you countryless bastards!

40
00:03:19,558 --> 00:03:21,027
That`s it.

41
00:03:21,028 --> 00:03:23,968
You pushed us too far!

42
00:03:23,968 --> 00:03:30,118
I`ll show you what these "countryless" soldiers can do!

43
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:34,069
what`s this commotion?

44
00:03:40,684 --> 00:03:42,448
What are you doing here?

45
00:03:43,463 --> 00:03:49,121
If I may ask  you that question,
Your Majesty, why are you here?

46
00:03:51,943 --> 00:03:53,923
We`ll part for now.

47
00:03:53,923 --> 00:03:56,661
i will see you at the palace.

48
00:04:14,303 --> 00:04:19,056
General, we can send the displaced citizens
to Mt.Dongmo at last.

49
00:04:19,056 --> 00:04:23,896
Was the negotiation with Li Jinzhong successful?

50
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,838
-Congratulations, Joyoung!
-Congratulations!

51
00:04:28,838 --> 00:04:33,088
-Where is my father right now?
-He is in his quarters.

52
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:41,619
He and my uncle will handle te relocation of the refugees.
We will be joining the Khitans in their war against Tang.

53
00:04:41,619 --> 00:04:42,619
Aye!

54
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:59,029
-Father!
-I heard the news.

55
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:00,650
Good work!

56
00:05:01,274 --> 00:05:04,402
When can we take the refugees back?

57
00:05:04,668 --> 00:05:06,265
The soner the better.

58
00:05:07,405 --> 00:05:11,935
start preparing the refugees for departure immediately.
~Dae Jungsang~

59
00:05:11,935 --> 00:05:15,362
-We will leave with in the next ten days.
-Yes, general.

60
00:05:16,007 --> 00:05:21,555
But the fall harvest is coming up,
and they will want to leave thereafther.
~Bang Gae~

61
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:24,974
we can`t take all of them at once.

62
00:05:24,974 --> 00:05:28,690
-Start with those who able to leave now.
-Yes, sir.

63
00:05:58,954 --> 00:06:06,162
Xue Rengui at your service, Your Majesty.

64
00:06:06,162 --> 00:06:08,602
Welcome, General Xue.

65
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:14,291
did you select the warriors that will serve under you?

66
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:18,926
I`d like to speak to you about that if I may.

67
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:21,076
Go on.

68
00:06:21,585 --> 00:06:27,637
It`s about General Zhang Xuanyu and Ma Renjie
who fled from Li Kaigu.
~Xue Rengui~

69
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,133
Permit me to put them to important service.

70
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:37,267
They have been removed from service
for failing to carry out my order.
~Emperor Wu Zetian~

71
00:06:37,268 --> 00:06:43,452
Your Majesty, they are veteran warriors
who fought countless battles in the frontier.

72
00:06:43,452 --> 00:06:49,328
And they know Li Kaigu better than anyone other warrior
having served under him for many years,

73
00:06:52,637 --> 00:06:55,247
Very well.

74
00:06:55,247 --> 00:07:01,230
-You may put them back to service if you wish.
-Tank you, Your majesty.

75
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,160
And Your Majesty,

76
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,999
-General Li Wen is heing held behind bars...
-And?

77
00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:13,208
You wish to utilize Li Wen as well?

78
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:17,242
-I would be thrilled if you would allow it.
-the answer is no.

79
00:07:17,572 --> 00:07:18,572
Your Majesty....

80
00:07:18,862 --> 00:07:24,320
He is the man responsible for this crisis
having failed to suppress the rebellion in Yingzhou.

81
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,853
I can`t forgive him and absolve him from punishment
even befor he is brought to trial.

82
00:07:30,037 --> 00:07:32,497
Your Majesty.

83
00:07:32,497 --> 00:07:40,822
Li Wen  may have failed to accomplish his mission,
but he is an exceptional warrior.

84
00:07:40,823 --> 00:07:48,750
-There are plenty of other exceptional warriors in Tang.
-But Li Wen is the only warrior

85
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,297
that ever defeated Dae Joyoung.

86
00:07:53,945 --> 00:08:02,820
This may be a war against Tang,
but it`s a fight against Dae Joyoung and Li Kaigu.

87
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:09,974
Zhang Xuanyu and Ma Renjie knows Li Kaigu,
and Li Wen knows Dae Joyoung.

88
00:08:09,974 --> 00:08:15,113
So their service will be vital in this war.

89
00:08:17,514 --> 00:08:19,129
Li wen as well?

90
00:08:21,953 --> 00:08:25,939
Very well.
Do as you wish.

91
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:31,330
Thank you, Your Majesty!

92
00:08:41,613 --> 00:08:42,613
General!

93
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:48,018
Have you forgotten everything Li Wen has done to us?

94
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:53,836
You should let him rot in jail.
Why are you saving him?

95
00:08:53,836 --> 00:09:00,738
My trysted friend have become enemies overnight.

96
00:09:00,738 --> 00:09:07,566
at least I know that Li Wen won`t betray me.

97
00:09:08,424 --> 00:09:12,007
Bring him to me at once.

98
00:09:12,007 --> 00:09:15,860
Yes, general.
Let`s go!

99
00:09:23,812 --> 00:09:27,827
General!!

100
00:09:32,326 --> 00:09:34,590
Go take a bath first.

101
00:09:36,989 --> 00:09:39,753
What`s your real agenda?

102
00:09:40,843 --> 00:09:42,755
What are you talking about?

103
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:48,145
What are you trying to do to me
calling me to serve under you?
~Li Wen~

104
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:54,745
You made a mess of Yingzhou
so you have to clean it up!

105
00:09:56,017 --> 00:10:02,582
I`d rahter rot in jail than join this conquest.

106
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:08,411
You`d rahter die than serve me.
Is that it?

107
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:14,174
-I`m done here.
-Li wen!

108
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:23,564
I told you once that
I would let out my last roar someday.

109
00:10:23,564 --> 00:10:25,712
Do you recall?

110
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:38,684
Everyone who is anyone has jumped into this war.
Li Jinzhong, sun Wanrong and Li Kaigiu of Khitan,

111
00:10:38,684 --> 00:10:41,968
and Dae Joyoung and dae Jungsang as well.

112
00:10:43,003 --> 00:10:51,111
That`s the reason why I gave up my cushy life
and jumped into this.

113
00:10:51,111 --> 00:10:57,691
To crush all of the major players come out on top
as the final victor!

114
00:10:57,691 --> 00:11:05,632
Xue Rengui is stretching his arms
to let out his last roar to the world!

115
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:09,055
Do you understand?

116
00:11:18,035 --> 00:11:21,337
~Mt.Dongmo, Goguryeoan Settlement~

117
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:40,772
-Father, welcome back.
-Grandfather....

118
00:11:40,773 --> 00:11:44,656
Dan and Jeak, you`re back!

119
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,954
Look how much you`ve grown!

120
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:56,675
You`ve accomplished a monumental task
bringing back the refugees.

121
00:11:58,526 --> 00:12:00,126
Please come inside.

122
00:12:00,126 --> 00:12:02,385
There is so much we want to know about.

123
00:12:03,262 --> 00:12:09,144
Send a message to Joyoung about our arrival.
Our delay probably has him worried.

124
00:12:09,991 --> 00:12:10,991
Yes, sir.

125
00:12:11,651 --> 00:12:13,304
Please come inside.

126
00:12:14,071 --> 00:12:16,135
Yes, shall we?

127
00:12:18,499 --> 00:12:22,713
Tang army is to attack Yingzhou?

128
00:12:22,714 --> 00:12:29,548
Our intent was to get all of the displaced Goguryeoans out
before the war but that may not be possible.

129
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:38,628
I`d like to go to Yingzhou
and help father.

130
00:12:39,431 --> 00:12:41,226
I can`t let you do that.

131
00:12:41,226 --> 00:12:45,789
-Mother!
-Dan, I can`t allow that either.

132
00:12:45,789 --> 00:12:49,745
You`re too young for the battlefield.

133
00:12:49,745 --> 00:12:54,301
But fahter was only about my age
when he fought his first battle.
~Dan:Dae Joyoung`s son~

134
00:12:54,301 --> 00:12:56,526
Please give me your permission.

135
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:04,955
If you really wish to help your father,
help the newly arrived refugees to get settled here.
~Sukyoung:King Bojan`s nice~

136
00:13:05,308 --> 00:13:06,308
But Mother!

137
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:11,159
That`s the best way to help your father.

138
00:13:38,181 --> 00:13:41,636
Dan has disappeared.

139
00:13:41,636 --> 00:13:45,855
What do you mean?
Where could he be?

140
00:13:46,286 --> 00:13:47,286
Father?

141
00:13:48,438 --> 00:13:50,849
He must`ve gone to his father.

142
00:13:52,401 --> 00:13:56,182
But the road is so long and so rough!

143
00:13:57,632 --> 00:13:59,984
He`s just like his father!

144
00:13:59,984 --> 00:14:05,965
Joyoung traveled from Pyongyang Fort
to Goryeo Fort to find me at his age.

145
00:14:30,276 --> 00:14:34,040
What? Xue Rengui?
~Li Jinzhong:King of Khitan~

146
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,044
Xue Rengui is the commanding the Tang punitive expedition?

147
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,740
Yes, Your Majesty.

148
00:14:39,741 --> 00:14:44,246
That`s the report from our informants in Chang`an.

149
00:14:44,247 --> 00:14:45,795
Unbelievable!

150
00:14:45,795 --> 00:14:49,883
I never dreamed we would have to fight Xue Rengui!

151
00:14:49,883 --> 00:14:51,477
That`s not all.

152
00:14:51,478 --> 00:14:58,505
There are 28 subordinate generals
including Zhang Xuanyu, Ma Renjie and Li Wen.

153
00:15:01,238 --> 00:15:06,105
-Zhang Xuanyu, and Ma Renjie?
-And Li Wen?

154
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,829
Li Wen is coming back?
~Sun Wanrong~

155
00:15:09,267 --> 00:15:15,507
There are indications that
Tang court wants us completely destroyes
~Shin Hong~

156
00:15:16,106 --> 00:15:21,724
We may be up against a stronger army than we
anticpated but the Khitan army is strong as well.
~Chulin~

157
00:15:22,863 --> 00:15:24,553
That`s right, father.
~Li Geom~

158
00:15:24,553 --> 00:15:28,884
Neighboring tribes have sent
considerable reinforcements as well.

159
00:15:28,884 --> 00:15:33,269
How about Dae Joyoung?
Why isn`t he here?

160
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,850
Your Majesty,

161
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:46,469
Dae Joyoung`s army is small compared to the
reinforcements troops we have from neighboring tribes.

162
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:51,651
Dae Joyoung`s army may not be large,
but they are powerfull!

163
00:15:51,652 --> 00:15:56,206
-You saw them driving out the Tang army
from Yingzhou with your own eye!
-But Your Majesty.

164
00:15:56,726 --> 00:16:01,316
we have General Li Kaigu`s fifty thousand soldiers.

165
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:05,010
Please don`t rely so heavily on Dae Joyoung.

166
00:16:05,011 --> 00:16:12,826
Xue Rengui recruited his most despised enemy
Li Wen to win this war!

167
00:16:12,826 --> 00:16:20,169
It is divine fortune that Dae Joyoung is with us at this time
when the fate of our newfound country hangs in the balance!

168
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,940
Send for him at once!

169
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:55,449
We joined this fight for two reasons.

170
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,790
One,

171
00:16:56,999 --> 00:17:01,082
to protect tje lives of the remaining
Goguryeoans in Yingzhou,

172
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,083
and two,

173
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:07,024
because peace in Yingzhou is directly linked
to peace in the entire northern region.

174
00:17:08,434 --> 00:17:14,640
Let me make it very clear that
we are entering this war as your ally.

175
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:21,175
And I ask that you keep your agreement
to release the remaining Goguryeoans
once this war is over.

176
00:17:21,993 --> 00:17:28,266
You have my word your request will be granted.

177
00:17:31,357 --> 00:17:33,948
We have a request as well.

178
00:17:33,948 --> 00:17:38,874
We may be an allied force
but an army requires order and discipline.

179
00:17:38,874 --> 00:17:48,060
Therefore, General Li Kaigu will be the commander
in chief of the allied force, and all of the tactics
and directions will come directly from us.

180
00:17:48,747 --> 00:17:58,920
We have no objections about General Li commanding this war.
But if we must receive tactics and directions from you,
it wouldn`t be a relationship of allies but of master and servent.

181
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,563
A two headed horse gets nowhere.

182
00:18:02,563 --> 00:18:06,570
We can`t prevail with two different strategies
and two sifferent directions.

183
00:18:06,571 --> 00:18:10,626
-So you`re telling us to take orders from you?
-That`s absurd.

184
00:18:10,626 --> 00:18:12,008
This is not an allience!

185
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,559
Forget this!

186
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:21,790
-Call this whole thing off and let`s get out of here.
-Do you think we`re just going to let you walk out of here?

187
00:18:23,571 --> 00:18:26,341
Are you bastard threatening us?

188
00:18:27,004 --> 00:18:28,738
What? Bastards?

189
00:18:28,739 --> 00:18:31,598
-What?
-That`s enough!

190
00:18:32,352 --> 00:18:35,828
You`re before the King!

191
00:18:39,471 --> 00:18:40,471
Your Majesty.

192
00:18:41,292 --> 00:18:46,459
we can`t defeat the enemy with this kind of alliance.

193
00:18:48,341 --> 00:18:52,633
I`ve granted all of your requests, General Dae.

194
00:18:52,633 --> 00:19:02,726
Likewise, you must cooperate and
give the right of command to the Khitans.

195
00:19:02,982 --> 00:19:04,616
Is that agreed?

196
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:16,781
Otherwise I can`t release the refugees either.

197
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:24,208
Your Majesty!

198
00:19:28,412 --> 00:19:33,354
Your Majesty,
Tang army has reached Shanhai PAss!

199
00:19:34,104 --> 00:19:35,426
Shanhai Pass?

200
00:19:35,911 --> 00:19:38,024
Any report on their size?

201
00:19:38,025 --> 00:19:41,068
It`s a massive army of two hundred thousand soldiers!

202
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,714
two hundred thousand?

203
00:19:43,714 --> 00:19:49,987
Two hundred thousand soldiers are assembled at Shanhai Pass....

204
00:19:57,922 --> 00:20:00,677
Princess Im Yugwan

205
00:20:04,055 --> 00:20:09,845
~Tang Army Headquarters, Shanhai Pass~

206
00:20:15,326 --> 00:20:23,750
There are two forces disturbing order
and creating confusion in the northern region!

207
00:20:24,076 --> 00:20:32,680
One is the Turks of the northwest region,
and the other is the Khitans of Yingzhou.
~Xue Rengui~

208
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,777
that took up arms against Tang!

209
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:45,300
We will establish our headquarters here at Shanhai
and advance to Yingzhou.

210
00:20:46,867 --> 00:20:57,392
These are your assignments,
so listen closely.

211
00:21:00,109 --> 00:21:02,921
-Hongpei,
-Yes, sir.

212
00:21:04,953 --> 00:21:10,322
I will announce the commanders of the 28 armies.

213
00:21:14,303 --> 00:21:19,311
In command of the First army, Li Wen!

214
00:21:23,481 --> 00:21:28,782
In command of the second army Zhang Xuanyu!

215
00:21:29,891 --> 00:21:30,891
Loyalty!

216
00:21:31,181 --> 00:21:36,153
In command of the Third army is Li Duoja!

217
00:21:36,687 --> 00:21:37,687
Loyalty!

218
00:21:38,128 --> 00:21:42,590
In command of the Fourth Army, Ma Renjie!

219
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:49,569
In command of the Fifth Army, Zhao Renshi!

220
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:57,269
In command of the sixth....

221
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:09,480
This is where Tang headquarters is locarted.
~Khitan Army Headquarters, Yingzhou~

222
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,039
They will divide up their troops
and attack Yingzhou from all sides.

223
00:22:15,504 --> 00:22:20,287
As all of you know Yingzhou is not
an ideal location for siege warfare.

224
00:22:20,287 --> 00:22:27,813
Thus our best option is to go out there
and cut off their advance before they reach Yingzhou.

225
00:22:28,453 --> 00:22:34,021
They`re advancing from different directions
so they could split us up.
~Mimosa~

226
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:37,147
You`d give them what they want?

227
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:39,099
You`re right.
~Shin Hong~

228
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:43,156
Division would weaken us
more than it would weaken them.

229
00:22:43,156 --> 00:22:48,657
But we can`t leave the paths wide open for them
to advance just to stay uni8ted.

230
00:22:49,345 --> 00:22:53,702
The Tang soldiers are exhausted from long travel.

231
00:22:53,702 --> 00:22:59,903
And we have greater knowledge
about the lay of the land than they do.

232
00:22:59,903 --> 00:23:05,883
If we take full use of these advantages,
we can still defeat them even if we have to split up.

233
00:23:07,451 --> 00:23:09,543
Take a closer look.

234
00:23:09,543 --> 00:23:14,039
The neighboring tribes will defend
the east bound path north of Yingzhou for us.

235
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:19,386
This southwest path,
wich is most likely to be their main route of attack,
will be guarded by General Li Kaigu.

236
00:23:21,548 --> 00:23:25,220
General Sun Wanrong will take the southeast route,

237
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:31,390
and general Xue Jitou,
Mogae and Doyeop will take the east and west side.

238
00:23:33,226 --> 00:23:41,175
If each of us do our jobs,
Yingzhou will be completely protected.
~Li Kaigu~

239
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:45,729
You haven`t told us what to do.

240
00:23:46,721 --> 00:23:50,492
You and your men will guard the city gates of Yingzhou.

241
00:23:52,485 --> 00:23:54,120
What did you say?

242
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,884
You called us to be gatekeepers?

243
00:23:56,884 --> 00:24:01,011
This is unbelievable!

244
00:24:01,011 --> 00:24:06,204
You`re unfamiliar with the lay of the land in Yingzhou.
We can`t assign you to important tasks.

245
00:24:06,205 --> 00:24:11,103
If that`s the way you feel,
this war will be over before we fight a single battle.

246
00:24:11,728 --> 00:24:13,664
Don`t worry.

247
00:24:13,664 --> 00:24:17,568
You will have your chance to fight in due time.

248
00:24:17,568 --> 00:24:22,562
I have a suggestion
if you`re that hungrry for honors.

249
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:30,545
Disband your army and come under me.

250
00:24:31,731 --> 00:24:33,200
How about it?

251
00:24:33,201 --> 00:24:35,538
Will you fight with us?

252
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:48,726
Guarding the gate is a very important task as well.
We will comply.

253
00:25:07,368 --> 00:25:12,863
Li Kaigu will not give us a chance to render any worthy service.

254
00:25:12,863 --> 00:25:18,607
If we fail to do significant work,
we will face difficulty taking the remaining refugees back.

255
00:25:18,607 --> 00:25:23,654
Any news from Mt.Dongmo about my father`s arrival?

256
00:25:23,654 --> 00:25:25,728
No, not yet.

257
00:25:25,728 --> 00:25:29,966
I`m sure we will hear from him very soon.

258
00:25:29,966 --> 00:25:37,541
We must render considerable service in this war
in order to save the rest of the refugees.

259
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:41,920
But we will accomplish nothing being gatekeepers.

260
00:25:47,673 --> 00:25:51,738
Let`s think harder about this.

261
00:25:51,738 --> 00:25:55,047
There has got to be a way.

262
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:06,487
We need every last able bodied man we can get, Father.
Why won`t you let General Dae Joyoung fight with us?

263
00:26:07,249 --> 00:26:14,040
-It`s already been discussed and decided by the tactician and myself.
-But the fate of the nation is at stake.

264
00:26:14,628 --> 00:26:19,605
We don`t need Dae Joyoung to win this war.

265
00:26:19,605 --> 00:26:22,165
Let us believe in ourselves, Geom.

266
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,257
Is it the refugees?

267
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:31,560
Are you holding Dae Joyoung back
because you don`t want to lose the refugees?

268
00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:36,817
Goguryeoan refugees are ou people, too.
Why are we fighting this war?

269
00:26:36,818 --> 00:26:40,485
Isn`t it to protect our land and our people?

270
00:26:40,486 --> 00:26:47,058
Losing our people is
just as detrimental as losing a war.

271
00:26:47,058 --> 00:26:51,580
We can`t lose anymore of our people
to Dae Joyoung than we already have.

272
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:58,296
It`s in the best interest of the state,
so we will not discuss this any further.

273
00:26:58,699 --> 00:27:00,112
Don`t worry.

274
00:27:00,358 --> 00:27:06,549
We don`t need Dae Joyoung`s help
to protect Yingzhou.

275
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:19,704
~Tang Army Headquarters, Shanhai Pass~

276
00:27:39,592 --> 00:27:40,592
Darn!

277
00:27:41,947 --> 00:27:46,479
-I just can`t figure it out!
-Figure out what, sir?

278
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:55,260
I know what we have to do to win this war
but I just don`t know how.

279
00:27:56,281 --> 00:27:59,536
What do you mean by that?

280
00:27:59,537 --> 00:28:02,282
Think about it.

281
00:28:02,282 --> 00:28:06,308
Winning this war is very simple.

282
00:28:06,308 --> 00:28:10,202
All I have to do is to turn Li Kaigu and Dae Joyoung
against each other.

283
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:16,839
I see, but how will you manage to do that?
~Hongpie~

284
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:20,853
that`s what I said I can`t figure out!

285
00:28:23,751 --> 00:28:24,751
General!

286
00:28:32,276 --> 00:28:35,597
General, we`re prepare to move out.

287
00:28:36,355 --> 00:28:41,234
How large is Li Kaigu`s army?

288
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:42,860
He has fifty thousand troops, sir.

289
00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:45,856
Fifty thousand....

290
00:28:45,856 --> 00:28:52,427
They couldn`t have recruited more than twenty thousand troops
from the neighboring tribes.

291
00:28:53,141 --> 00:28:56,927
And there`s only about another tweenty thousand troops
in the Khitan Army.

292
00:28:58,385 --> 00:29:00,377
How about Dae Joyoun?

293
00:29:00,377 --> 00:29:03,574
How many men does Dae Joyoun have?

294
00:29:04,073 --> 00:29:09,174
There were a little over five thousand men
when he attacked Yingzhou.
~Li Wen~

295
00:29:11,199 --> 00:29:17,860
That`s less than half our size
even if you put them all together.

296
00:29:18,401 --> 00:29:21,913
So why are you worried?

297
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:29,531
Deom weapons to soldiers,
we are by far superior to the enemy.

298
00:29:29,531 --> 00:29:35,682
I guess you`re becoming anxious with your old age.

299
00:29:39,139 --> 00:29:42,901
Watch your language, General Li Wen!

300
00:29:46,392 --> 00:29:49,809
Yes, I am old.

301
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:55,154
My days are numbered,
so I want no regrets.

302
00:29:56,303 --> 00:30:00,230
I`ve tasted countless victories on the battlefied.

303
00:30:00,635 --> 00:30:08,613
But if I lose what is likely to be my last fight.
I would have faild at life.

304
00:30:08,613 --> 00:30:12,620
That`s why I can`t fail.

305
00:30:14,304 --> 00:30:21,570
I will stay here and observe the developments for now.

306
00:30:21,571 --> 00:30:29,509
The rest of you will advance to Yingzhou
at first light tomorrow!

307
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:31,632
Yes, general!

308
00:31:02,205 --> 00:31:04,774
How can you fall asleep at a time like this?

309
00:31:04,774 --> 00:31:08,514
Go splash some cold water on you face!

310
00:31:08,514 --> 00:31:09,514
Yes....

311
00:31:10,818 --> 00:31:12,913
There is one thin we can do.

312
00:31:13,936 --> 00:31:17,866
Disband the troops like Li Kaigu said.

313
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:24,719
We will split up and join the Khitan army.

314
00:31:26,758 --> 00:31:30,356
Disband the troops?
Are you out of your mind?

315
00:31:32,196 --> 00:31:34,493
Mimosa.

316
00:31:34,494 --> 00:31:39,255
perhaps you need some cold water on your face, too.

317
00:31:39,255 --> 00:31:45,346
What we need right now is to distinguish ourselves in this war.
It doesn`t matter where it is done as long as it`s done.

318
00:31:46,713 --> 00:31:52,719
Our enemy in this war is Tang,
but we are competing against the Khitans
for distinguished services.

319
00:31:52,719 --> 00:31:55,835
In other words,
our enemy is both Tang and the Khitan.

320
00:31:55,836 --> 00:31:58,313
How can we defeat them both?

321
00:32:01,381 --> 00:32:02,824
Defeat them both?

322
00:32:02,824 --> 00:32:07,055
How are we going to do that?
Gaepils, you have any ideas?

323
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:08,730
Huh?

324
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:14,819
Oh, the general will tell us.

325
00:32:15,696 --> 00:32:19,934
Gulsabiwu, get out there and start making the raven flags.

326
00:32:20,991 --> 00:32:23,628
-The raven flags? For what?
-There is no time.

327
00:32:23,628 --> 00:32:29,870
Make as many as you can
and hand them out to the soldiers.

328
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:32,390
Yes, general.

329
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:35,939
Not you too, Joyoung.
Don`t do this to us.

330
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:41,669
Mimosa, go to Li Kaigu at once.
tell him we will disband the troops to serve in his army.

331
00:32:42,173 --> 00:32:43,448
Yes, sir.

332
00:32:44,167 --> 00:32:46,408
That`s it!

333
00:32:46,408 --> 00:32:56,582
This is the only way to defeat the Tang
Chinese and outshine the Khitans.

334
00:33:10,597 --> 00:33:14,725
General, General Dae Joyoung sent a messenger.

335
00:33:15,224 --> 00:33:16,883
It`s Mimosa.

336
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:19,125
Mimosa?

337
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:25,579
-What does he want with me at this time of the night?
-I`ll go see what he wants.

338
00:33:34,781 --> 00:33:38,103
-You will disband the troops?
Yes,

339
00:33:38,103 --> 00:33:43,115
we will spit our men up and incorporate
them into the Khitan army.

340
00:33:43,964 --> 00:33:47,277
I`m glad to hear that.

341
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:55,100
But I`m very suprised that
General Dae would make such a decision.

342
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:01,772
He cares deeply about his men.
You are amazing man

343
00:34:01,772 --> 00:34:05,395
for making him come to this decision.

344
00:34:05,981 --> 00:34:11,599
If this is a ploy of some sort,
I suggest you stop immediately.

345
00:34:12,424 --> 00:34:17,743
General Dae is going to disband his army,
and give his position and power to serve this war.

346
00:34:17,743 --> 00:34:20,011
What kind of ploy could there be?

347
00:34:22,673 --> 00:34:26,580
Then you can you can serve under me.

348
00:34:31,091 --> 00:34:35,716
We could come up with some awesome ideas
if we put our heads together.

349
00:34:35,716 --> 00:34:41,710
How about it?
Will you help me?

350
00:34:43,338 --> 00:34:49,074
How could I refuse such a
valuable opportunity for learning?

351
00:35:01,948 --> 00:35:03,565
We are prepared.

352
00:35:07,669 --> 00:35:13,117
I regreat having to split you up like this.
Remember.

353
00:35:13,117 --> 00:35:18,519
We came together under one flag and fought our enemys.

354
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:25,240
But now each of you is an army of one
fighting your own enemies. 

355
00:35:26,857 --> 00:35:32,390
Wherever you are assigned,
whomever you serve,
always spearhead the fight.

356
00:35:32,391 --> 00:35:41,417
And if you kill enemy officer or capture ground,
take out the raven flag and mark your feat.

357
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:46,776
Each of your achievements will be all of our achievements.

358
00:35:46,776 --> 00:35:49,578
-Is that understood?
-Yes, sir!

359
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:54,421
Geumlan and I were assigned under Sun Wanrong.

360
00:35:54,834 --> 00:35:58,249
Then you will be in the mountains.

361
00:35:58,249 --> 00:36:02,972
It will be a fight to capture grounds,
so prepare large flags.

362
00:36:03,622 --> 00:36:05,809
We already have, sir.

363
00:36:08,512 --> 00:36:09,512
Sudol!

364
00:36:10,655 --> 00:36:15,262
I`m going under Xue Jitou with Gaepil and Tungso.

365
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,571
You`ll be on flat land.

366
00:36:17,571 --> 00:36:19,936
Focus on takin out the enemy leader.

367
00:36:20,468 --> 00:36:26,712
I`m not good at a whole lot of things,
but no one can kill like me on horseback!

368
00:36:26,712 --> 00:36:30,006
Don`t worry about us, general!

369
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:38,457
I will be going under Li Kaigu with Mapa.

370
00:36:38,858 --> 00:36:42,726
Why does it have to be that rotten bastard?

371
00:36:42,726 --> 00:36:44,309
Don`t worry about me.

372
00:36:45,212 --> 00:36:51,679
Once our achievements are recognized
after the first battle,
chances are we will be back together.

373
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:58,426
And when we do,
we will be fighting together again.

374
00:36:58,427 --> 00:37:02,198
It is our duty to stay alive until then.

375
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:05,692
-Is that clear?
-Yes, general!

376
00:37:27,056 --> 00:37:28,056
Your Majesty,

377
00:37:28,981 --> 00:37:34,464
all preparations are complete!
Command us to march to battle!

378
00:37:34,465 --> 00:37:40,376
Command us to march to battle, Your Majesty!

379
00:37:37,807 --> 00:37:38,807
Command us to march to battle, Your Majesty!

380
00:37:40,539 --> 00:37:43,328
Command us to march to battle, Your Majesty!

381
00:37:44,636 --> 00:37:48,299
Is it true you disbanded Dae Joyoung`s army?

382
00:37:48,443 --> 00:37:50,336
Yes, YourMajesty.

383
00:37:51,029 --> 00:37:56,735
Did you consider whether this action
would help us or hurt us?

384
00:37:57,627 --> 00:37:59,801
I have considered long and hard, Your Majesty.

385
00:38:00,857 --> 00:38:05,484
If it helps us we will win this war,

386
00:38:05,484 --> 00:38:08,810
but if it hurts us we will be defeated.

387
00:38:09,441 --> 00:38:14,241
And you, Li Kaigu,
will be held responsible for the outcome!

388
00:38:15,789 --> 00:38:16,789
Your Majesty,

389
00:38:17,383 --> 00:38:21,606
I, Li Kaigu, will never be defeated!

390
00:38:21,606 --> 00:38:26,081
I will bring you only victory!

391
00:38:26,755 --> 00:38:27,755
Very well.

392
00:38:29,251 --> 00:38:34,960
I am counting on you and the brave Khitan warriors!

393
00:38:36,432 --> 00:38:39,474
March out to battle!

394
00:38:39,474 --> 00:38:45,090
Crush those who dare to threaten our new state!

395
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:47,434
Go!

396
00:38:48,651 --> 00:38:53,904
Brave soldiers of Khitan,
go out there and fight!

397
00:38:54,118 --> 00:38:55,782
Yes, Your Majesty!

398
00:38:56,475 --> 00:39:01,064
Loyalty!Loyalty! Loyalty!

399
00:39:06,127 --> 00:39:16,708
In AD 696 the same year Khitan declared autonomty,
Tang court dispatched 28 generals

400
00:39:17,704 --> 00:39:24,272
including Zhang Xuanyu, Ma Renjie, Li Duoja,
and Zhao Renshi to Shanhai Pass

401
00:39:24,272 --> 00:39:28,134
and begand a massive punitive campaign against the Khitans.

402
00:39:28,775 --> 00:39:32,609
In response,
Khitans rallied their neighboring forces 

403
00:39:32,609 --> 00:39:37,529
including the former Goguryeoan forces,
to fight the Tang army.

404
00:39:38,338 --> 00:39:45,645
This was the start of an importand war
that would decide the subsequent fate
and mastery of nothern China.

405
00:39:55,111 --> 00:39:56,111
General,

406
00:39:57,103 --> 00:40:01,195
this is where Li Kaigu`s main force is located.

407
00:40:02,555 --> 00:40:09,095
Sun Wanrong`s army is here,
and Xue Jitou is right over here.

408
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:16,203
Honpei, don`t you find something very odd?

409
00:40:17,224 --> 00:40:20,024
Odd? What`s odd?

410
00:40:21,413 --> 00:40:23,487
Where is Dae Joyoung?

411
00:40:24,851 --> 00:40:26,610
Dae Joyoung is....

412
00:40:29,328 --> 00:40:34,576
Dae Joyoung is one of the men that caused this war.

413
00:40:34,577 --> 00:40:38,682
He would never turn around and leave
when the battle is about to begin.

414
00:40:38,993 --> 00:40:43,841
I found nothing about Dae Joyoung
in the report from our informants.

415
00:40:44,226 --> 00:40:46,450
That`s why I`m puzzled.

416
00:40:46,973 --> 00:40:53,872
Perhaps he and Li Kaigu separated.

417
00:40:56,147 --> 00:40:59,008
"Separated"?

418
00:40:59,008 --> 00:41:01,472
What are they, lovers?

419
00:41:05,823 --> 00:41:08,702
-Hongpei,
-Yes, general.

420
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:13,821
Can you do me a favor and take that curtain off?

421
00:41:15,453 --> 00:41:19,485
This is a cape,
and I happen to think it make me look dashing.

422
00:41:19,486 --> 00:41:20,856
Just take it off!

423
00:41:22,602 --> 00:41:30,193
This is not a matter to be over looked.
Where did Dae Joyoung disappeared to?

424
00:41:31,033 --> 00:41:36,675
Now there is no telling
when he will show up and blindside us!

425
00:41:37,593 --> 00:42:02,960
I`ll send an alert to each army
to watch for Dae Joyoung.

426
00:41:43,371 --> 00:41:47,929
Yes, that might make me feel a little better.

427
00:41:49,316 --> 00:41:54,500
I just don`t feel at ease....

428
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,718
~Khitan Camp, Yingzhou~

429
00:42:07,553 --> 00:42:09,916
General!!

430
00:42:12,476 --> 00:42:16,588
The Tang army has reached the ten mile mark
from the front line.

431
00:42:18,005 --> 00:42:19,560
How many of them are there?

432
00:42:19,561 --> 00:42:21,918
There are at least thirty thousand of them.

433
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:27,500
If my guess is right,
LiWen is their leader. 

434
00:42:28,011 --> 00:42:36,615
Send the advance guards to advance base at once.
I want a detail report of their every move.

435
00:42:37,739 --> 00:42:39,972
I will go to the advance base.

436
00:42:42,517 --> 00:42:46,353
You could be the first to die once the battle begins.

437
00:42:46,353 --> 00:42:50,598
I could also be the first to kill the enemy commander
once the battle begins.

438
00:42:53,263 --> 00:42:58,825
General Dae Joyoung will lead the advance guards.

439
00:42:58,825 --> 00:43:03,064
The war has now begun!
Take your positions,

440
00:43:03,064 --> 00:43:07,215
and keep a tight reign on the soldiers!

441
00:43:07,462 --> 00:43:09,514
Yes, general!

442
00:43:35,166 --> 00:43:36,998
Did you wish to see me?

443
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:41,734
I`d like you to go with the advance guards.

444
00:43:41,735 --> 00:43:44,799
Advance base is very important place. 

445
00:43:44,799 --> 00:43:47,865
We can`t trust it to Dae Joyoung alone.

446
00:43:47,865 --> 00:43:50,360
Observe the enemy,

447
00:43:51,294 --> 00:43:54,904
but watch Dae Joyoung very closely as well.

448
00:43:54,904 --> 00:43:57,828
I just don`t understand.

449
00:43:57,828 --> 00:44:02,972
Why are you and my father 
so distrustful of General Dae Joyoung?

450
00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:09,780
There is not a whole lot you can trust in this world....
especially not during war. 

451
00:44:10,996 --> 00:44:16,450
There is only one man you can trust in this world
and that`s your father.

452
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:19,465
You have to remember that. 

453
00:44:26,545 --> 00:44:30,185
Li Kaigu?
Are you sure it`s Li Kaigu?

454
00:44:30,573 --> 00:44:31,573
Yes, general.

455
00:44:31,922 --> 00:44:35,192
-How about our other fronts?
-The`re studying the enemy

456
00:44:35,192 --> 00:44:39,178
like we are checked on their advance.

457
00:44:39,961 --> 00:44:41,186
And Dae Joyoung?

458
00:44:41,455 --> 00:44:44,374
We have yet to receive any report about him.

459
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:49,386
I want a report on Zhang Xuanyu, Ma Remjie
and Li Duoja`s current position as well.

460
00:44:49,387 --> 00:44:50,719
We`ll get on it, sir.

461
00:44:55,339 --> 00:44:58,431
I`m sure he is in this war...

462
00:44:58,431 --> 00:45:04,727
But Dae Joyoung and his entire army have disappeared!

463
00:45:28,223 --> 00:45:32,754
You should be tending to your weapon and not your face
if you want to survive out there.

464
00:45:33,442 --> 00:45:36,579
Why are you painting your face anyway?

465
00:45:36,579 --> 00:45:40,298
To forget that I`m a woman.

466
00:45:46,458 --> 00:45:51,736
You should be tending to your weapon,
not staring at me if you want to survive out there.

467
00:46:07,627 --> 00:46:12,665
If you want to paint your face, do it right.
You don`t want the enemy to laugh at you.

468
00:46:35,522 --> 00:46:38,845
I`m starving.
Tungso!

469
00:46:48,825 --> 00:46:54,496
We have to eat well
if we`re going to collect the enemy`s heads.

470
00:46:56,259 --> 00:47:00,075
Tungso, couldn`t you get us any meat?

471
00:47:00,075 --> 00:47:05,040
-I took everything I could find.
-Be thankful we have this.

472
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,502
Eat up.

473
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:10,451
You!

474
00:47:14,811 --> 00:47:16,688
You bastard!!

475
00:47:19,724 --> 00:47:21,829
What are you doing here?

476
00:47:25,902 --> 00:47:32,324
So you`re the three fat rats in this camp that I heard about.

477
00:47:32,638 --> 00:47:34,109
Food is life!

478
00:47:34,648 --> 00:47:37,779
How dare you lay your hands on military property
during war time!

479
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:42,166
Don`t you know the punishment for this kind of crime?

480
00:47:42,633 --> 00:47:45,816
Sometimes you can judge a book by its cover.

481
00:47:46,473 --> 00:47:50,906
You look like thieves and you are thieves!

482
00:47:52,743 --> 00:47:54,275
Blasted bastard!

483
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:02,730
You spat on General Xue Jitou`s face!

484
00:48:02,731 --> 00:48:04,991
I`m sorry.

485
00:48:05,773 --> 00:48:09,835
I always earn my keep.
Cut us some slack this time.

486
00:48:11,899 --> 00:48:14,443
Tungso, clean that off for him.

487
00:48:14,443 --> 00:48:16,463
Get your filthy hands off of me!

488
00:48:16,463 --> 00:48:20,395
I`m a general!
A General of the Khitan mobile forces!

489
00:48:25,164 --> 00:48:27,536
What is that, general?

490
00:48:30,459 --> 00:48:35,545
Isn`t that the old Goguryeoan military flag?

491
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:37,762
Have you seen this flag before?

492
00:48:37,763 --> 00:48:42,607
I`ve seen a few Goguryeoan refugees
who had this flag.

493
00:48:44,529 --> 00:48:50,282
This flag used to make the Tang Chinese run away in fear.

494
00:48:51,158 --> 00:48:54,942
What are you going to do with it?

495
00:48:55,645 --> 00:48:59,810
I`m going to display it at the frontline
when the battle begins.

496
00:49:00,948 --> 00:49:04,821
But Goguryeo has long been destroyed and gone.

497
00:49:05,357 --> 00:49:10,205
Yes, but the sons of Goguryeo are still alive and fighting.

498
00:49:11,724 --> 00:49:13,768
Goguryeo is in our blood.

499
00:49:14,711 --> 00:49:21,141
We can`t change who we are
or where we come from.

500
00:49:30,776 --> 00:49:34,044
We can`t locate Geom.
Do you know where he is?

501
00:49:34,044 --> 00:49:38,821
He wouldn`t go anywhere without telling us.
We are worried sick.

502
00:49:39,225 --> 00:49:42,536
Geom is at the advance base.

503
00:49:43,829 --> 00:49:45,632
The advance base?

504
00:49:45,632 --> 00:49:48,863
You mean he`s with Dae Joyoung?

505
00:49:50,506 --> 00:49:55,230
I asked him to go
so he can keep an eye on Dae Joyoung for us.

506
00:49:55,582 --> 00:49:56,582
No!

507
00:49:56,838 --> 00:50:00,096
He has to stay away from Dae Joyoung!

508
00:50:01,251 --> 00:50:04,090
General, what`s wrong?

509
00:50:11,238 --> 00:50:19,145
Could you give me this flag?

510
00:50:21,866 --> 00:50:26,566
I would like to display this flag
when the battle begins.

511
00:50:28,063 --> 00:50:30,204
I could,

512
00:50:30,204 --> 00:50:35,804
but you`re a prince of Khitan now.
It won`t be appropriate.

513
00:50:38,012 --> 00:50:42,158
Why do you want to display the flag anyway?

514
00:50:43,972 --> 00:50:46,188
I just like it.

515
00:50:48,183 --> 00:50:57,520
The way it looks, how it feels....
I just like it for no particulare reason.

516
00:51:09,423 --> 00:51:13,588
