What have you done?
Was quiet at f? Glarna, I said!

You have not taken, right?
You will be utilized.

341
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,040
Viktor has got their own room,

342
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,530
I told you he took

352
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,320
Okay, Warren.

Mr. Perry.
It? S b? St that you are observing? the h? r.

"Fr? Ga Arab how he f? R the stuff."

358
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:53,790
False accusations.
N? S not like Viktor.

359
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:57,800

- No, it has nothing with them to g? Ra.

360
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,800
If it? S n? T p? g? ng I want
that you take care of it right away.

361
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:06,210
Then n? R we become hysterical? Ver
an organized tjallarkampanj?

362
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:12,250
Klagom? L p? the food? s one thing that we would
ignore the hard drugs? r another.

363
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:16,140
Especially now, n? R we have
m? natliga inspections.

364
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,100
You can g ?.

Everything? S clean.

Do you t? Nkt p? what to g? ra
If he ker like?

No, Viktor? R f? R experienced

370
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,810
Yes, especially if n? N tipped him off.

371
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:33,740
Can I g? Ra? T f? R you, Fold?

372
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:38,420
I will g? Ra you a TJ? NST.

You can not come on? n? t

If you pc with regard to some thing, I see it on?
l? ngt h? ll. You would not see n? T.

376
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:54,920
Fold, buddy.
You do not, right?

377
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,480
The h? R? S not k? Ken.
You? Ker shortly.

378
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,200
And I'll need no g? Ra? T.

- N? N has given you hard drugs, Trav.

382
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:34,920
The? R the twins.
You know, s? N d? R telepathy.

383
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Yes. I would not be so? schyst

384
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:56,740
Why? R? R not you d? R gone?
? s not your family right here?

385
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:05,670
If they do not want to tr? LHW you,
Why? r they call Mr. Perry all the time?

386
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:09,110
- Did he say that?
- He's? Give it to you all the time.

387
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:13,560
Do not you think that I h? R there?
Why? Are not you talk to them?

388
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,320
It's none of your g? Ra.

389
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,520
You k? Nd not them.

390
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,850
You do not seem like tr? LHW them.

391
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:24,210
Sl pp there, okay?

392
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:28,660
I had worried me f? R

He adore you. He sees nothing.

395
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:07,740
Hello, Vik. Just checking it? R l? St.

409
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:29,220

410
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,140
- Against what?
- Another rovf? Gel.

411
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:34,590
A h? K, or n? T st? Rre.

412
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:39,150
The set him up to n? Tet and

413
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:43,950
- No no. I know he did it ...
- You do not know. H? L k? Ften.

414
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:47,200
- Listen to? n? n who knows.
- Look right here.

415
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,800
The h? R? R s? R fr? N claws. And h? R
will not fr? n the h? r f? rule.

416
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,690
See sj? Lv.

417
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:59,010
I've seen it f? Rut. It? S not
a m? nniska who have done it right here.

418
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:01,290
It can be a duvh? K.

419
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:03,940
What have you f? R intentions?

420
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:07,020
T? Nker you come in with a klagom? L?

421
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,700
There I could.

422
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,060
I mean, I've r? RIGHTS.

423
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:16,190
- It? S up to you, Shane.
- But ...

424
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:20,670
... it would f? rst? ra
full rovf? gelsprogrammet, right?

425
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:28,320
If I had my own room s? would
be n? n sort of compensation.

426
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,120
- Pull? T Hell, Shane.

430
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:45,780
Sir.

What for? Nker he to do?

432
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:51,060
None. He ins? G
that it is not l? g in his interest.

433
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:54,830
It? S not an option. Viktor m? Ste out.

434
00:49:54,910 --> 00:50:00,230
Come on, Terry. He went? Ver gr? NSE
but he has become provocerad-

435
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:04,720
- And he runs a program
you did not think would work.

01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,130
She gets a little carried away.

It? S time f? R her.

515

You have a good family.

748
01:31:37,410 --> 01:31:41,020
You have v? L no problems at volj? Tors?

749
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:45,460
No, I have realized a few things, just.

750
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:53,270

753
01:32:11,530 --> 01:32:16,090
A close? Ga p? Paul

754
01:32:16,170 --> 01:32:18,740
Shane? S not good f? R him.
