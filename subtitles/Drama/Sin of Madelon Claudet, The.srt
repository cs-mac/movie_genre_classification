1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:15,000
SIN CITY (2005)

2
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:18,789
(man) Just one hour to go.
My last day on the job.

3
00:00:18,862 --> 00:00:21,831
Early retirement.
Not my idea.

4
00:00:21,898 --> 00:00:24,833
Doctor's orders.
Heart condition.

5
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:27,597
"Angina" he calls it.

6
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:31,966
I'm polishing my badge and getting myself
used to the idea of saying goodbye to it.

7
00:00:32,042 --> 00:00:35,705
It, and the 30-odd years
of protecting and serving and tears

8
00:00:35,779 --> 00:00:40,375
and the blood and terror
and triumph it represents.

9
00:00:40,851 --> 00:00:43,581
I'm thinking about Eileen's slow smile.

10
00:00:43,653 --> 00:00:48,454
About the thick. fat steaks
she picked up at the butcher's today.

11
00:00:48,525 --> 00:00:51,926
And I'm thinking about
the one loose end I haven't tied up.

12
00:00:51,995 --> 00:00:56,955
A young girl who's out there somewhere,
helpless in the hands of a drooling lunatic.

13
00:01:01,938 --> 00:01:06,068
Damn it, Hartigan, I won't let you do this.
You're gonna get yourself killed.

14
00:01:06,143 --> 00:01:09,442
You're gonna get us both killed.
I won't let you. I'm warnin' you.

15
00:01:09,513 --> 00:01:11,447
Let go of my coat, Bob.

16
00:01:11,515 --> 00:01:13,506
You're draggin' me down with you.

17
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:17,019
I'm your partner.
They can kill me, too.

18
00:01:17,087 --> 00:01:20,454
I ain't puttin' up with that. I'm gettin'
on the horn and calling for backup.

19
00:01:20,524 --> 00:01:23,015
Sure, Bob.
We'll just wait.

20
00:01:23,093 --> 00:01:27,029
Sit on our hands while that Roark brat gets
his sick thrills with victim number four.

21
00:01:27,097 --> 00:01:29,224
Victim number four!

22
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:31,824
Nancy Callahan, age 1 1.

23
00:01:31,902 --> 00:01:34,166
And she'll be raped
and slashed to ribbons.

24
00:01:34,571 --> 00:01:38,166
And that backup that we're waitin' on
will just so happen to show up

25
00:01:38,241 --> 00:01:42,678
just late enough for Roark
to get back to his US Senator daddy.

26
00:01:42,746 --> 00:01:45,408
Take a deep breath, Hartigan.

27
00:01:45,482 --> 00:01:47,473
Settle down and think straight.

28
00:01:48,385 --> 00:01:52,412
You're pushin' 60
and you got a bum ticker.

29
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:54,480
You ain't savin' anyone.

30
00:01:56,093 --> 00:01:58,357
You got a great attitude, Bob.

31
00:01:59,096 --> 00:02:01,894
Real credit to the force, you are.

32
00:02:01,965 --> 00:02:05,594
Eileen's at home waitin' for you.
Think about Eileen.

33
00:02:08,505 --> 00:02:10,496
Heck, Bob,

34
00:02:12,943 --> 00:02:14,535
maybe you are right.

35
00:02:14,611 --> 00:02:17,910
I'm glad to hear you're finally talkin' sense.

36
00:02:18,982 --> 00:02:21,644
Hell of a way to end a partnership.

37
00:02:21,718 --> 00:02:24,380
Hell of a way to start my retirement.

38
00:02:24,454 --> 00:02:27,252
Nancy Callahan, age 1 1.

39
00:02:27,324 --> 00:02:29,815
For all I know she's dead already.

40
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:34,789
You've been a very good girl, Nancy.

41
00:02:34,865 --> 00:02:37,265
- You've been very quiet.
- (Nancy whimpers)

42
00:02:37,334 --> 00:02:39,564
Don't be scared.

43
00:02:39,636 --> 00:02:41,797
We're gonna be
taking you home really soon.

44
00:02:42,372 --> 00:02:46,900
But first,
we're going to introduce you to somebody.

45
00:02:46,977 --> 00:02:50,242
He's a very nice man.

46
00:02:51,581 --> 00:02:55,449
Halfway to the warehouse where
Weevil said they took her, and it hits.

47
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,079
Wicked spot of indigestion.

48
00:02:58,155 --> 00:03:00,555
At least that's what I pray it is.

49
00:03:00,624 --> 00:03:02,956
(man)...Iighthearted
and momentary digression.

50
00:03:03,026 --> 00:03:05,927
The briefest indulge-ment
in automotive pleasure.

51
00:03:05,996 --> 00:03:10,126
(man #2) For cheap thrills.
Such short-lived durability, Mr. Shlubb.

52
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,603
You would risk engender-ating ill will
on the part of our employers.

53
00:03:14,671 --> 00:03:16,832
Burt Shlubb and Douglas Klump -

54
00:03:16,907 --> 00:03:21,139
two any-dirty-job-there-is thugs
with delusions of eloquence.

55
00:03:21,578 --> 00:03:24,103
This Jaguar you so pinheadedly covet -

56
00:03:24,181 --> 00:03:26,843
temporarily remanded
to our custody though it may be -

57
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:30,148
remains the property
of the son of Senator Roark.

58
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,485
Gotta keep this quiet.
Take 'em down fast.

59
00:03:33,557 --> 00:03:35,582
A single dent,
the merest scratch thereupon,

60
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:38,651
and the before-mentioned consequences
of which I so recently made mention

61
00:03:38,728 --> 00:03:41,288
shall surely be athwart us.

62
00:03:46,503 --> 00:03:49,131
(heavy heartbeats)

63
00:03:49,206 --> 00:03:50,264
(groans)

64
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,834
Catch your breath.
Give your heart time to slow down.

65
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:56,902
But it won't slow down.

66
00:03:59,015 --> 00:04:01,006
Get over it.

67
00:04:01,484 --> 00:04:03,281
She needs you.

68
00:04:03,353 --> 00:04:05,082
We're all done here, Benny.

69
00:04:05,155 --> 00:04:08,682
Let's give them some time together.
Give them some privacy.

70
00:04:08,758 --> 00:04:10,623
Be with you in a minute, Lenny.

71
00:04:10,694 --> 00:04:13,026
I'm just making sure
they get along really well.

72
00:04:13,096 --> 00:04:18,864
And what kind of beast couldn't get along
with a precious little girl like this?

73
00:04:18,935 --> 00:04:22,098
You must be awfully scared now.

74
00:04:22,172 --> 00:04:25,539
But you've got nothing to be scared of.

75
00:04:25,609 --> 00:04:27,042
(Nancy whimpers)

76
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,442
All we're gonna do is  have a nice little talk.

77
00:04:31,014 --> 00:04:35,348
That's all. Just a nice talk.
Just you and me.

78
00:04:35,418 --> 00:04:38,910
- (sobbing)
- Don't you cry now.

79
00:04:38,989 --> 00:04:41,048
Doctor said it'd be like this.

80
00:04:41,124 --> 00:04:43,456
Just take the pill he gave you.

81
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:49,154
(grunts)

82
00:04:52,369 --> 00:04:54,496
No need to play it quiet.

83
00:04:54,571 --> 00:04:56,596
Not anymore.

84
00:04:57,974 --> 00:05:01,671
Breathe steady old man.
Prove you're not completely useless.

85
00:05:01,745 --> 00:05:04,475
What the hell?
Go out with a bang.

86
00:05:04,948 --> 00:05:06,711
He likes to hear 'em scream.

87
00:05:06,783 --> 00:05:09,377
I've seen his victims
and their twisted little faces,

88
00:05:09,452 --> 00:05:14,321
all wide-mouthed and bug-eyed, frozen
in their last horrible moment of living.

89
00:05:14,391 --> 00:05:19,055
No screams.
Either I'm just in time or I'm way too late.

90
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:20,994
(grunts)

91
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:25,295
Ooh!

92
00:05:29,506 --> 00:05:33,738
It's nothing. Barely a flesh wound.
On your feet old man.

93
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:42,611
(Hartigan) Roark.
Give it up.

94
00:05:43,119 --> 00:05:44,984
Let the girl go.

95
00:05:45,055 --> 00:05:47,250
You can't do
a goddamn thing to me, Hartigan.

96
00:05:47,324 --> 00:05:49,349
You know who I am.

97
00:05:49,426 --> 00:05:51,656
You know who my father is!

98
00:05:51,728 --> 00:05:54,253
You can't touch me, you piece-of-shit cop.

99
00:05:55,598 --> 00:05:59,159
Look at you. You can't even lift
that cannon you're carrying.

100
00:06:00,837 --> 00:06:02,304
Sure, I can.

101
00:06:03,206 --> 00:06:05,766
(screams)

102
00:06:09,913 --> 00:06:12,882
Cover your eyes, Nancy.
I don't want you watching this.

103
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,944
I mean it, baby.
Cover your eyes right now.

104
00:06:18,521 --> 00:06:20,148
I take his weapons away.

105
00:06:20,557 --> 00:06:22,184
(screams)

106
00:06:22,992 --> 00:06:24,584
Both of them.

107
00:06:24,661 --> 00:06:27,789
(shrieks)

108
00:06:27,864 --> 00:06:30,458
(groans)

109
00:06:35,138 --> 00:06:37,163
Hell of a way to end a partnership.

110
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,175
(Bob) For God's sakes,
don't make it any worse.

111
00:06:41,244 --> 00:06:44,839
- Don't make me kill you.
- Doin' fine, Bob.

112
00:06:45,215 --> 00:06:47,183
Never better.

113
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,911
(Roark grunting)

114
00:06:48,985 --> 00:06:51,419
I'm ready to kick your ass.

115
00:06:52,188 --> 00:06:54,349
Keep him talking.
Buy time.

116
00:06:54,424 --> 00:06:57,086
Just a few more minutes.
Just till the backup gets here.

117
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,096
Sit down and stay down.
I'll kill you if I have to.

118
00:07:01,164 --> 00:07:05,066
Keep his mind off the girl -
skinny little Nancy.

119
00:07:05,135 --> 00:07:06,898
He can't kill her
once the backup gets here.

120
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,530
Run home, Nancy.
Run for your life.

121
00:07:09,606 --> 00:07:12,473
Hey. Don't listen to him.
He's a crazy man.

122
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:15,841
- What a tough man you are, huh?
- You stay right where you're at.

123
00:07:15,912 --> 00:07:18,847
You shoot your partner in the back...

124
00:07:18,915 --> 00:07:21,076
then you try to scare a little girl.

125
00:07:21,151 --> 00:07:25,520
Maybe I'll pull my spare rod, plug you
a couple of times, show you how it's done.

126
00:07:25,588 --> 00:07:27,749
We could've worked something out,
but you've blown that.

127
00:07:27,824 --> 00:07:30,850
Sit down or I'll blast you in half.

128
00:07:31,361 --> 00:07:34,353
- You're so slow, you'll never stop me.
- Sit down!

129
00:07:35,198 --> 00:07:37,189
You'll never be able to stop me.

130
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:38,962
(screams)

131
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:45,605
(sirens blaring)

132
00:07:45,675 --> 00:07:49,202
I finally sit down.
just like you told me to.

133
00:07:51,047 --> 00:07:53,038
The sirens are close now.

134
00:07:54,117 --> 00:07:56,415
She'll be safe.

135
00:08:04,627 --> 00:08:08,961
Things go dark.
I don't mind much.

136
00:08:09,766 --> 00:08:13,463
Getting sleepy.
It's OK.

137
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:15,834
She'll be safe.

138
00:08:15,905 --> 00:08:18,305
An old man dies,

139
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:20,968
a little girl lives.

140
00:08:21,044 --> 00:08:23,137
Fair trade.

141
00:08:43,766 --> 00:08:46,997
Just tell me it isn't true, John.

142
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:51,131
What they're saying
about you and that child.

143
00:08:51,207 --> 00:08:53,300
It can't be true.

144
00:08:53,977 --> 00:08:57,469
If you ever want to see me again...

145
00:08:59,215 --> 00:09:02,378
say something now.

146
00:09:06,022 --> 00:09:08,547
We're looking at your
basic mountain of DNA evidence,

147
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,219
the testimony of your own partner,

148
00:09:11,294 --> 00:09:14,491
corroboration by six eye-witnesses -
and that's just so far -

149
00:09:14,564 --> 00:09:17,032
and there's your own silence.

150
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,127
I'll do what I can, but needless to say,
you are good and screwed.

151
00:09:21,204 --> 00:09:24,571
Come on, Hartigan.
What's holding you back?

152
00:09:24,641 --> 00:09:28,702
What's shutting you up?
This whole thing stinks to high heaven.

153
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:31,144
I'm not the only one
on the force who smells it.

154
00:09:31,214 --> 00:09:35,708
Sure, I'll rinse your bedpan
and wipe your butt. That's my job.

155
00:09:35,785 --> 00:09:39,152
But don't expect any friendly chitchat
outta me, mister.

156
00:09:39,222 --> 00:09:44,660
I heard what you've done to that girl.
I hope they throw away the key.

157
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:56,798
Evenin', officer.

158
00:09:57,807 --> 00:10:02,835
I don't have to introduce myself, do l?
You read the papers.

159
00:10:02,912 --> 00:10:06,370
This being an election year,
you've seen plenty of my picture.

160
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:10,044
You know who I am and what I can do.

161
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:12,849
And I'm doin' you, Hartigan.

162
00:10:12,922 --> 00:10:15,618
Cold and hard, I'm doing you.

163
00:10:15,692 --> 00:10:17,990
You blew my son's ear off.

164
00:10:19,596 --> 00:10:24,693
You blew his arm off.
You even blew his nuts and his pecker off.

165
00:10:26,836 --> 00:10:30,636
He's in a coma right now.
They say he may never come out of it.

166
00:10:30,707 --> 00:10:32,572
My boy.

167
00:10:32,642 --> 00:10:35,372
He could've been the first Roark to become
the President of the United States,

168
00:10:35,445 --> 00:10:39,677
but you went and turned him into
a brain-damaged, dickless freak.

169
00:10:40,249 --> 00:10:43,616
Pullin' that trigger make you feel powerful?

170
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:48,584
Power don't come from a badge or a gun.

171
00:10:49,425 --> 00:10:52,155
Power comes from lying.

172
00:10:52,228 --> 00:10:57,029
Lying big, and gettin' the whole
damn world to play along with you.

173
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,126
Once you got everybody agreeing with
what they know in their hearts ain't true,

174
00:11:00,203 --> 00:11:02,797
you've got 'em by the balls.

175
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:08,367
There's what,
maybe 500 people in this hospital?

176
00:11:10,513 --> 00:11:14,540
I could pump you full of bullets right now,
and I wouldn't even be arrested.

177
00:11:14,617 --> 00:11:17,984
Everyone would lie for me -
everyone who counts.

178
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:20,887
Otherwise, all their own lies -
everything that runs Sin City -

179
00:11:20,957 --> 00:11:24,984
it all comes tumbling down
like a pack of cards.

180
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:28,390
(laughs)

181
00:11:28,464 --> 00:11:31,900
But I want you firm and fit and healthy.

182
00:11:31,968 --> 00:11:35,028
I'm even putting up cash of my own
to get you more surgery.

183
00:11:35,104 --> 00:11:38,335
Fix that heart condition of yours.

184
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:43,838
You're gonna keep on living a long time.
I'm gonna make sure of that.

185
00:11:45,415 --> 00:11:50,478
You're gonna be convicted of raping
that little brat, and shooting my boy.

186
00:11:50,553 --> 00:11:52,953
And you're gonna spend
the rest of your life in prison,

187
00:11:53,022 --> 00:11:56,822
disgraced, destroyed...

188
00:11:56,893 --> 00:11:58,918
alone.

189
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:01,797
Your wife?

190
00:12:01,864 --> 00:12:04,128
You tell her the truth and she's dead.

191
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,294
You tell anybody the truth
and they're dead.

192
00:12:09,138 --> 00:12:10,969
They won't let me testify.

193
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,374
I told the cops that you saved my life
and they just acted like I was crazy.

194
00:12:15,445 --> 00:12:18,278
They talked my parents
into keeping me away.

195
00:12:18,347 --> 00:12:20,907
They said that you'd done things
that you didn't do.

196
00:12:20,983 --> 00:12:23,508
I told them that you saved me
from that Roark creep,

197
00:12:23,586 --> 00:12:27,750
but they won't even check me out
to see that I'm still a virgin.

198
00:12:27,824 --> 00:12:32,420
I'm still a virgin, still alive -
thanks to you.

199
00:12:32,962 --> 00:12:34,793
They got it all backwards.

200
00:12:34,864 --> 00:12:38,527
Sometimes, the truth
doesn't matter like it ought.

201
00:12:38,601 --> 00:12:42,196
But you'll always remember things right.

202
00:12:42,271 --> 00:12:44,398
That's gonna mean a lot to me.

203
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:51,036
But stay away, Nancy.
They'll kill you if you don't stay away.

204
00:12:51,114 --> 00:12:53,105
Don't visit me.

205
00:12:53,182 --> 00:12:54,979
Don't write me.

206
00:12:55,051 --> 00:12:57,246
Don't even say my name.

207
00:12:57,687 --> 00:13:01,783
Maybe you won't let me visit,
but I'll still write to you, Hartigan.

208
00:13:01,858 --> 00:13:03,849
I'll sign my letters "Cordelia"

209
00:13:04,427 --> 00:13:08,454
That's the name of a really cool
detective in books I read.

210
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:12,934
I'll write you every week... for forever.

211
00:13:13,002 --> 00:13:15,800
Sure, kid.

212
00:13:15,872 --> 00:13:17,999
Now, run on home.

213
00:13:18,074 --> 00:13:20,406
It's not safe for you here.

214
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,178
Bye, Nancy.

215
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,851
I love you.

216
00:13:40,096 --> 00:13:42,223
John Hartigan.

217
00:13:43,065 --> 00:13:45,090
Mr. Law and Order.

218
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:49,603
Mr. By the Book.

219
00:13:49,672 --> 00:13:51,867
Mr. High and Mighty.

220
00:13:54,277 --> 00:13:57,610
I gotta give you credit, being such
a straight arrow for so damn many years

221
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,841
without it catching up with you.

222
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:03,181
It's catching up with you now,
friend of mine.

223
00:14:03,252 --> 00:14:05,516
It's catching up with you but good.

224
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:12,391
(woman) Maybe I oughta look at him.
He doesn't look too good.

225
00:14:12,461 --> 00:14:18,866
Ohh, he's hale and hearty, Tammy. See?

226
00:14:18,935 --> 00:14:22,302
He's the picture of health.

227
00:14:22,371 --> 00:14:25,829
That Tammy, there - she's fine, isn't she?

228
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:28,172
I rented her out of Old Town.

229
00:14:28,244 --> 00:14:32,908
I wanted to show you what you won't
be getting any of, not in prison.

230
00:14:32,982 --> 00:14:34,347
You hear me, Hartigan?

231
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:38,114
If you stop being stupid,
start playing along with us,

232
00:14:38,187 --> 00:14:41,054
you might just get some of Tammy.

233
00:14:41,123 --> 00:14:44,820
You see that?
She flinched.

234
00:14:44,894 --> 00:14:47,226
You make her sick.

235
00:14:47,296 --> 00:14:50,094
She heard about you and that little girl.

236
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:54,535
This is nothing but a price I promised
myself I'd pay. and I'm paying it.

237
00:14:54,604 --> 00:14:58,973
You don't save a little girl's life, then
turn around and throw her to the dogs.

238
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,066
Not in my book you don't.

239
00:15:01,143 --> 00:15:04,601
They want a confession.
They won't get it.

240
00:15:07,617 --> 00:15:11,576
There was a letter from Nancy waiting
when they put me in solitary.

241
00:15:11,654 --> 00:15:14,748
She calls herself "Cordelia"
just like she promised.

242
00:15:14,824 --> 00:15:18,590
She makes no mention of anything
that would give her away.

243
00:15:19,528 --> 00:15:21,655
At first, I figure
she'll send another note or two

244
00:15:21,731 --> 00:15:25,030
before her young mind
moves on to better things.

245
00:15:25,101 --> 00:15:28,366
But every Thursday, another one arrives.

246
00:15:28,437 --> 00:15:30,268
What a sweet kid.

247
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,708
I do my best to keep my hand
from shaking when I reach for it.

248
00:15:34,777 --> 00:15:39,237
She's the only friend I've got -
the daughter I never had.

249
00:15:39,315 --> 00:15:41,306
My sweet Cordelia.

250
00:15:41,384 --> 00:15:43,978
Skinny little Nancy Callahan.

251
00:15:45,788 --> 00:15:48,279
Eight years pass.

252
00:15:52,662 --> 00:15:55,654
Then comes a Thursday
when I bound from my cot.

253
00:15:55,731 --> 00:15:57,756
excited as a kid at Christmas.

254
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:01,428
only to find myself
staring at the damn floor of my damn cell.

255
00:16:01,504 --> 00:16:04,701
Iooking for a letter from Nancy
that isn't there.

256
00:16:05,274 --> 00:16:07,708
Then another Thursday with no letter.

257
00:16:07,777 --> 00:16:09,642
Is she all right?

258
00:16:09,712 --> 00:16:12,112
Did something happen to her?

259
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:14,706
Nothing.

260
00:16:14,784 --> 00:16:18,481
Two months now -
not a word from Nancy.

261
00:16:18,554 --> 00:16:21,990
Did they find her?
Did they get to her?

262
00:16:22,058 --> 00:16:25,585
Of course!
Stupid old man.

263
00:16:25,661 --> 00:16:29,290
Do your math.
Nancy's 19 years old.

264
00:16:29,365 --> 00:16:31,856
How long did you expect her
to keep writing?

265
00:16:31,934 --> 00:16:35,631
She was a saint to keep it up
as long as she did.

266
00:16:35,705 --> 00:16:38,799
She's forgotten you. old man.

267
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:40,842
You're alone.

268
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,310
You're all alone.

269
00:16:50,786 --> 00:16:54,688
This guy smells awful -
like bad food.

270
00:16:54,757 --> 00:16:58,158
Like a corpse left in a garbage dumpster
in the middle of summer.

271
00:16:58,227 --> 00:17:00,422
He stinks so bad. I want to throw up.

272
00:17:11,307 --> 00:17:14,401
Practically knocked my head off.
the bastard.

273
00:17:14,944 --> 00:17:17,276
When I come to. I see it.

274
00:17:17,346 --> 00:17:20,611
The same kind of envelope
Nancy always uses.

275
00:17:20,683 --> 00:17:23,208
but there's no letter inside of it.

276
00:17:23,285 --> 00:17:25,310
There's something soft.

277
00:17:25,388 --> 00:17:29,324
something that ought to be alive -
a hunk of meat and bone

278
00:17:29,392 --> 00:17:33,488
that ought to be the index finger
of the right hand of a 19-year-old girl.

279
00:17:33,562 --> 00:17:35,689
How the hell did they find her?

280
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:37,562
She was so careful.

281
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:40,500
She never gave away
where she lives or where she works.

282
00:17:40,569 --> 00:17:42,560
(screams)

283
00:17:45,574 --> 00:17:49,032
I've got to get out.
I've got to help her.

284
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:54,208
Nothing else matters -
not my life and not my pride. either.

285
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:56,877
It's only one final surrender they want.

286
00:17:56,952 --> 00:18:00,649
You got me. Roark.
You beat me.

287
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:11,659
I'll get it, Claire.
That'll be Marv.

288
00:18:11,734 --> 00:18:14,897
He never sleeps.
He's always getting himself in deep.

289
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,768
Yeah?

290
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,671
What?

291
00:18:19,742 --> 00:18:22,540
Hartigan.
My God, it is you.

292
00:18:22,611 --> 00:18:24,238
Yes, yes...

293
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:26,781
I'll get right on it.
Right this second.

294
00:18:27,383 --> 00:18:30,375
I'll be there by ten, I promise.

295
00:18:32,588 --> 00:18:36,922
(Hartigan) Lucille. She wouldn't give up
on me back before the trial.

296
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:40,291
She almost slugged me when I stopped
her from hiring a new attorney.

297
00:18:40,362 --> 00:18:43,729
When I refused to plead innocent.
she did slug me.

298
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:46,495
If she hears what I'm gonna do,
she'll probably slug me again.

299
00:18:46,569 --> 00:18:50,596
Hartigan...
Hot damn.

300
00:18:56,212 --> 00:18:58,544
It's like they were waiting for my call.

301
00:18:58,614 --> 00:19:01,481
They're ready to deal.
They're practically begging for a deal.

302
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,949
They're scared of something.

303
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:06,419
One of them as much as promised me
parole if you confess and express regret

304
00:19:06,489 --> 00:19:09,481
and all that other dumb crap
that, of course, we won't go for.

305
00:19:09,558 --> 00:19:12,584
We're getting you out for time served,
with no strings attached.

306
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:17,155
Then we're gonna sue those sorry
sons of bitches for false prosecution.

307
00:19:17,233 --> 00:19:20,862
You're gonna be exonerated,
and a very rich man.

308
00:19:20,936 --> 00:19:23,496
- This isn't like you think it is.
- The hell it isn't.

309
00:19:23,572 --> 00:19:26,837
Anyone can figure out who framed you,
but even Senator Roark isn't God.

310
00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:30,106
- You hung up the phone too soon.
- We use the law, the press...

311
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:33,945
- He will never know what hit him.
- I'm gonna confess.

312
00:19:34,817 --> 00:19:37,115
Excuse me?

313
00:19:37,186 --> 00:19:40,713
John Hartigan, crawling on his belly
in front of a parole board?

314
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:44,054
Confessing to raping a little girl
and blubbering for mercy?

315
00:19:44,126 --> 00:19:46,287
No, doesn't work.

316
00:19:46,362 --> 00:19:51,561
I'm going in there telling them
I'm a twisted, wretched child molester,

317
00:19:51,634 --> 00:19:55,195
agreeing to anything they want from me.

318
00:20:00,376 --> 00:20:02,867
All right, you son of a

319
00:20:04,713 --> 00:20:07,307
Let's get this over with.

320
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:16,916
I say everything they want to hear.
just the way they want to hear it.

321
00:20:16,992 --> 00:20:21,429
I tell them I'm a twisted.
wretched child molester.

322
00:20:21,497 --> 00:20:24,955
I agree to everything they want from me.

323
00:20:26,035 --> 00:20:28,162
I love you Nancy.

324
00:20:39,949 --> 00:20:42,679
It's a lot of miles into town, Hartigan.

325
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:49,883
- You care for a ride?
- Long as you stay in front of me.

326
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:53,861
Prison's made you paranoid.
Talk about water under the bridge.

327
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:56,454
Christ.

328
00:20:56,532 --> 00:20:59,365
Eight years.

329
00:20:59,435 --> 00:21:02,734
Yeah.
Eight years.

330
00:21:04,073 --> 00:21:07,042
Well, if it's any consolation to you...

331
00:21:08,877 --> 00:21:11,072
you made me hate myself.

332
00:21:13,582 --> 00:21:16,813
- Any word from Eileen?
- Yeah.

333
00:21:17,186 --> 00:21:21,054
She got remarried four years ago.

334
00:21:23,392 --> 00:21:27,556
She had two kids.
I'm sorry, John.

335
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,655
Don't be.

336
00:21:29,732 --> 00:21:32,223
I'm glad.

337
00:21:32,301 --> 00:21:35,498
Eileen always wanted kids.

338
00:21:35,571 --> 00:21:37,562
She'll make a good mother.

339
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:43,842
Like you said, Bob -
water under the bridge.

340
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:58,057
Bob and I get on
with our fond farewells to each other.

341
00:21:58,127 --> 00:22:02,325
then I go looking for the only human being
on the planet who means a damn to me -

342
00:22:02,398 --> 00:22:03,797
Nancy.

343
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:07,324
How could they have found out it was you
writing all those letters to me?

344
00:22:07,736 --> 00:22:10,170
How did they find out who you are?

345
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:13,402
And what have they done to you. baby?

346
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:19,240
Not a sound.

347
00:22:19,315 --> 00:22:22,045
No sign of life.

348
00:22:22,117 --> 00:22:25,848
Has Roark gone to all this trouble
just to torture a broken old man.

349
00:22:25,921 --> 00:22:29,687
Iike a kid poking at a fly
when he's already torn his wings off?

350
00:22:29,758 --> 00:22:32,556
What has he done to Nancy?

351
00:22:32,628 --> 00:22:35,358
It's like all she ever does
is read and study and write.

352
00:22:35,764 --> 00:22:40,861
No diary, no phone numbers
or addresses written down anywhere.

353
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:45,840
Closest thing to a clue
is a pack of matches from a lousy saloon.

354
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:51,205
It's a long shot.
but maybe she's got some friends there.

355
00:22:57,786 --> 00:22:59,981
A dead end.

356
00:23:00,055 --> 00:23:03,752
Nancy wouldn't have anything to do
with a pack of drunks and losers like this.

357
00:23:03,826 --> 00:23:07,762
But if there's anything to be found here,
the faintest lead to wherever Nancy is

358
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,890
or whoever kidnapped her
and mutilated her, this is the place.

359
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:15,999
Excuse me, miss. Wondering if you
could help me. I'm looking for somebody.

360
00:23:16,071 --> 00:23:19,404
Cold night like this, everybody's
looking for somebody, stranger.

361
00:23:19,475 --> 00:23:22,342
It's not like that.
Her name is Nancy.

362
00:23:22,411 --> 00:23:24,902
Eyes to the stage, pilgrim.

363
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:28,211
She's just warming up.

364
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:39,283
Skinny little Nancy Callahan.

365
00:23:39,361 --> 00:23:41,261
She grew up.

366
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:44,265
She filled out.

367
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:47,962
Nancy Callahan. 19 years old.

368
00:23:49,872 --> 00:23:52,966
And here I was.
expecting a skinny little bookworm.

369
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:56,807
maybe a bit too shy for her own good.

370
00:23:56,879 --> 00:24:02,784
How little she told me about herself
in all her letters for all those years.

371
00:24:06,955 --> 00:24:09,321
How the hell did they find her?

372
00:24:09,391 --> 00:24:11,916
Then it hits me.

373
00:24:11,994 --> 00:24:14,258
They were bluffing.

374
00:24:15,097 --> 00:24:17,998
I've led them straight to her.

375
00:24:26,275 --> 00:24:29,301
She hasn't spotted you yet.

376
00:24:29,378 --> 00:24:31,938
Turn around and walk out the door.

377
00:24:33,048 --> 00:24:34,743
Lead the creep outside.

378
00:24:34,817 --> 00:24:40,084
Get that Beretta away from him somehow.
and kill him.

379
00:24:40,155 --> 00:24:44,114
I'm just a horny ex-con
watching an exotic dancer.

380
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:47,162
Just a few seconds and she'll be safe.

381
00:24:47,896 --> 00:24:50,694
No Nancy.
Don't notice me.

382
00:24:50,766 --> 00:24:54,133
Don't recognize me.

383
00:25:03,846 --> 00:25:05,871
There's no time to explain.

384
00:25:05,948 --> 00:25:08,940
I've made a terrible mistake,
put you in terrible danger.

385
00:25:09,017 --> 00:25:11,383
We need to get out of here
right this second.

386
00:25:11,453 --> 00:25:15,321
Whatever you say, Hartigan.
Let me throw some clothes on.

387
00:25:17,426 --> 00:25:22,261
And here I'd figured you'd forgotten
all about me. Me and my dumb letters.

388
00:25:22,331 --> 00:25:24,731
Kept me going.

389
00:25:25,968 --> 00:25:28,300
Kept me from killing myself.

390
00:25:29,938 --> 00:25:32,031
Hurry up, will you?

391
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,512
- (Hartigan) Maybe I should drive.
- (Nancy) Not a chance.

392
00:25:41,316 --> 00:25:44,080
Nobody but me
can keep this heap running.

393
00:25:49,892 --> 00:25:53,555
Besides, from the sound of things,
you might have to shoot somebody.

394
00:25:53,629 --> 00:25:56,621
- I don't have a gun.
- Under the seat.

395
00:25:58,267 --> 00:26:00,098
It's loaded and it works.

396
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:04,732
Yeah, this'll do.

397
00:26:04,806 --> 00:26:08,298
Taken it to the range a couple of times.
Kicks like a mule.

398
00:26:12,414 --> 00:26:17,681
Hartigan, there's so much
I've wanted to say to you.

399
00:26:17,753 --> 00:26:20,313
You've never been far from my thoughts.

400
00:26:20,389 --> 00:26:24,018
I've lain awake nights, thinking of you.

401
00:26:24,092 --> 00:26:26,890
- What are you talking about?
- (gunshot)

402
00:26:26,962 --> 00:26:31,729
Keep driving, Nancy.
Keep driving and keep the car on the road!

403
00:26:34,536 --> 00:26:36,470
She's counting on you, old man.

404
00:26:36,538 --> 00:26:38,369
What are you doing?

405
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,840
Prove you're still worth a damn.

406
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:49,511
Try and keep it on the road, Nancy!

407
00:26:52,287 --> 00:26:53,948
He's a decent shot.

408
00:26:54,022 --> 00:26:56,923
He's got skill.
but he's in too much of a hurry.

409
00:26:56,992 --> 00:26:59,984
Throwing away bullets
like they were candy.

410
00:27:04,032 --> 00:27:06,091
He doesn't know how to take his time.

411
00:27:06,168 --> 00:27:09,467
Aim careful and look the devil in the eye.

412
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,346
Stop the car, Nancy.
Gotta confirm the kill.

413
00:27:20,415 --> 00:27:22,508
- What?
- Stop the car, now!

414
00:27:22,584 --> 00:27:25,678
Right.
Stop the car, confirm the kill.

415
00:27:32,327 --> 00:27:35,194
Sorry, I got a little rattled.

416
00:27:35,263 --> 00:27:39,597
It's OK. You did great.
Sit tight. I'll be right back.

417
00:27:39,668 --> 00:27:41,863
No!
Let me stay close.

418
00:27:41,937 --> 00:27:44,462
Nothing can happen to me
when I'm with you.

419
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:47,736
Please?
Let me stay close.

420
00:27:57,352 --> 00:28:01,118
The stink - I almost gag.

421
00:28:01,189 --> 00:28:03,123
His blood smells
even worse than he does.

422
00:28:03,191 --> 00:28:06,183
- Jesus.
- And it's all over the place.

423
00:28:06,261 --> 00:28:10,755
- But the creep himself. he's gone.
- (siren blaring)

424
00:28:10,832 --> 00:28:12,891
We're out of time.

425
00:28:12,968 --> 00:28:17,428
The sirens - I used to welcome the sound.

426
00:28:17,939 --> 00:28:20,806
There's nothing to do now
but find a place to hole up for the night,

427
00:28:20,876 --> 00:28:24,642
get Nancy calmed down, and figure out
what on Earth I'm going to do next.

428
00:28:24,713 --> 00:28:28,274
The stink - somehow it stays with us
all the way to the motel.

429
00:28:29,051 --> 00:28:31,076
Nancy, I went to your apartment.

430
00:28:31,153 --> 00:28:35,089
Your window was thrown wide open.
The rooms looked almost empty.

431
00:28:35,157 --> 00:28:37,489
That's why I was sure
you'd been kidnapped.

432
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:41,325
My window? Robbed again?
That's the third time this year!

433
00:28:41,396 --> 00:28:45,025
I swore if I ever saw you again,
I'd show you I grew up strong.

434
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,729
But there I was, just like before,
scared and helpless.

435
00:28:48,804 --> 00:28:51,364
- I'm such an asshole.
- You should sit down.

436
00:28:52,574 --> 00:28:55,543
You'll feel a little bit better if you sit down.

437
00:28:56,211 --> 00:28:58,509
I've never been all that good with people.

438
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:01,947
When it comes to reassuring
a traumatized 19-year-old.

439
00:29:02,017 --> 00:29:05,919
I'm as expert as a palsy victim
doing brain surgery with a pipe wrench.

440
00:29:05,987 --> 00:29:08,888
It's always been you, Hartigan.

441
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:10,925
All these years.

442
00:29:12,027 --> 00:29:14,689
It's just nerves
making you say that, Nancy.

443
00:29:14,763 --> 00:29:17,994
You're just exhausted.
You need to sleep.

444
00:29:18,066 --> 00:29:21,263
- Sleep with me.
- Stop it, Nancy!

445
00:29:21,703 --> 00:29:23,796
Eight years.

446
00:29:23,872 --> 00:29:27,501
Why do you think
I kept writing you those letters?

447
00:29:27,576 --> 00:29:29,771
It wasn't just gratitude.

448
00:29:29,845 --> 00:29:32,939
I tried to fall in love with boys.

449
00:29:33,014 --> 00:29:35,380
Even thought I did once or twice.

450
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:39,546
But I was already in love... with you.

451
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:42,820
No.

452
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:21,053
There's wrong and there's wrong
and then there's this.

453
00:30:21,129 --> 00:30:23,654
For God's sakes, you're just a kid!

454
00:30:24,566 --> 00:30:26,659
I love you.

455
00:30:31,339 --> 00:30:33,807
I love you, too.

456
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,775
With all my heart.

457
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:40,242
Cold shower - it helps.

458
00:30:40,315 --> 00:30:41,612
No, Nancy.

459
00:30:45,153 --> 00:30:47,417
Recognize my voice, Hartigan?

460
00:30:47,489 --> 00:30:51,323
Recognize my voice,
you piece of shit cop?

461
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:55,227
I look different,
but I bet you can recognize my voice.

462
00:30:55,297 --> 00:30:59,290
Sure.
I recognize your voice, Junior.

463
00:31:02,337 --> 00:31:04,828
Everything's gone straight to hell.

464
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:07,340
I've been suckered
into betraying the only friend I've got.

465
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:11,106
and put her in the hands of a murdering
rapist I thought I'd put down for good.

466
00:31:11,713 --> 00:31:15,376
Suckered by a spoiled brat
son of a senator.

467
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,441
It's all gone to hell.

468
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,487
Klump, it's me.

469
00:31:19,554 --> 00:31:22,421
I got a dead man needs to be fetched.

470
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,515
I want you to set me up for a party.

471
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:27,027
I've already got the girl, you dumb shit!

472
00:31:27,095 --> 00:31:30,030
Hey, it better be perfect
or I'm calling my dad!

473
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:32,623
My tools better be clean and sharp.

474
00:31:32,701 --> 00:31:35,431
It better be ready!
It better be perfect!

475
00:31:37,339 --> 00:31:42,868
I get to do whatever I want,
however I want, whenever I want it!

476
00:31:43,411 --> 00:31:46,676
My dad - I'd love him if I didn't hate him.

477
00:31:46,748 --> 00:31:49,512
He spent a fortune
hiring every expert on the planet

478
00:31:49,584 --> 00:31:52,781
to grow back that equipment
you blew off from between my legs,

479
00:31:52,854 --> 00:31:57,223
just so the old fart can hold out
some kind of hope of having a grandkid.

480
00:31:57,292 --> 00:32:01,285
Although, as you can see,
there were some side effects.

481
00:32:01,363 --> 00:32:03,558
I'm not complaining, though.
Since you've been gone,

482
00:32:03,632 --> 00:32:05,395
I've been having the time of my life.

483
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:08,994
And now you've led me back
to your darling Cordelia.

484
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:11,197
We all wondered
who wrote all those letters.

485
00:32:11,273 --> 00:32:13,264
She left not a clue.

486
00:32:14,609 --> 00:32:17,874
Clever girl.
And so pretty, so pretty.

487
00:32:20,548 --> 00:32:24,541
A little old for my taste,
but I can forgive that just this once.

488
00:32:24,619 --> 00:32:27,816
Nancy, don't scream.

489
00:32:27,889 --> 00:32:30,357
Whatever he does to you, don't scream.

490
00:32:30,425 --> 00:32:34,759
She'll scream. I'm gonna take
all night doing dear old Nancy.

491
00:32:34,829 --> 00:32:38,162
And you're gonna die knowing
that it's all your fault.

492
00:32:38,233 --> 00:32:40,929
They've all screamed, Hartigan.

493
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:43,800
Dozens of them - maybe a hundred.

494
00:32:43,872 --> 00:32:47,035
Eight years' worth.
Every one of them has screamed.

495
00:32:47,108 --> 00:32:49,372
And if there weren't
so many people hereabout,

496
00:32:49,444 --> 00:32:53,437
I would show you how
I'm gonna make dear old Nancy scream.

497
00:32:53,515 --> 00:32:56,211
It's gonna be one hell of a show!

498
00:32:59,754 --> 00:33:02,086
(he chokes)

499
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:08,889
This is it.
No way to fight it now.

500
00:33:08,964 --> 00:33:11,023
No hope left.

501
00:33:11,099 --> 00:33:12,862
No chance.

502
00:33:12,934 --> 00:33:16,734
This is it.
This is the end.

503
00:33:19,474 --> 00:33:20,566
No.

504
00:33:21,209 --> 00:33:25,475
Give it a shot. old man.
Keep your neck tight. Move.

505
00:33:25,547 --> 00:33:29,483
The window - maybe there's an alarm.
The window.

506
00:33:29,551 --> 00:33:32,213
Keep your neck tight, goddamn it!
Stay conscious!

507
00:33:32,287 --> 00:33:35,085
Stay conscious.

508
00:33:35,156 --> 00:33:36,350
No alarm.

509
00:33:36,424 --> 00:33:39,188
The glass! Cut the rope.

510
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:42,093
You can do it.
You can do it.

511
00:33:42,163 --> 00:33:43,858
(Klump) It is inclement upon me

512
00:33:43,932 --> 00:33:48,266
to comment with marked displeasure
on your rash impulsiveness

513
00:33:48,336 --> 00:33:55,105
in selecting such an eye-catching
and impractical car to heist, Mr. Shlubb.

514
00:33:55,176 --> 00:33:57,508
Protest though you might, Mr. Klump,

515
00:33:57,579 --> 00:34:02,812
you must nonetheless admit the phallic
magistry of said Ferrari's performance.

516
00:34:02,884 --> 00:34:07,548
An engine of Cyclopean power
throbs beneath this steel stallion's hood.

517
00:34:07,622 --> 00:34:13,288
Irrelevant to said mission is the following
query, which I now put forth to you.

518
00:34:13,828 --> 00:34:19,528
Wherein this most streamlined
and trunkless of transports -

519
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:22,161
boner-inspiring though it may be -

520
00:34:22,237 --> 00:34:27,140
wherein are we to reposit
our recently deceased cargo?

521
00:34:29,177 --> 00:34:31,008
A worthy concern.

522
00:34:32,547 --> 00:34:35,072
Neatly elucidated.

523
00:34:38,486 --> 00:34:41,887
I can only express puzzlement
that borders on alarm.

524
00:34:46,428 --> 00:34:50,159
Tell me where Roark takes the girls
or I'll cut your damn head off!

525
00:34:50,231 --> 00:34:51,926
In plain English, creep!

526
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,766
The answer you seek is rural,
even agrarian.

527
00:34:57,105 --> 00:34:59,198
The farm!

528
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:03,010
That's all I need to hear.
Every cop on the force

529
00:35:03,078 --> 00:35:07,174
knows about the Roark family's farm
and to stay away from it.

530
00:35:07,248 --> 00:35:09,546
Shlubb and Klump
were packing an arsenal.

531
00:35:09,617 --> 00:35:12,745
Once things get loud.
I'll probably have use for the cannons.

532
00:35:12,821 --> 00:35:15,790
But at first. I'll have to play it quiet.

533
00:35:15,857 --> 00:35:18,087
Quiet and nasty.

534
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,027
Nancy's car - six miles from the farm.

535
00:35:22,097 --> 00:35:25,362
"Nobody but me can keep
this heap running. " she told me.

536
00:35:25,433 --> 00:35:28,925
Good girl.
The car stalled out on that yellow bastard

537
00:35:29,003 --> 00:35:31,369
and you didn't tell him
how to start it up again.

538
00:35:31,439 --> 00:35:35,375
You kept your mouth shut.
I'll bet Junior was furious.

539
00:35:35,443 --> 00:35:38,037
I'll bet he slapped you around
something fierce.

540
00:35:38,113 --> 00:35:42,072
But you stayed strong.
You bought a few extra minutes.

541
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:44,380
There's still a chance, Nancy.

542
00:35:44,452 --> 00:35:46,420
Don't scream.

543
00:35:47,489 --> 00:35:51,084
I ditch the car a mile or so from the farm
and make my way through the woods.

544
00:35:51,593 --> 00:35:55,085
I'm not halfway there when it hits.

545
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:59,625
My heart.
Can't be my heart.

546
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:02,534
I was cured.

547
00:36:02,604 --> 00:36:05,630
Bad cough - blood in it.

548
00:36:06,141 --> 00:36:07,768
Doesn't matter now.

549
00:36:07,842 --> 00:36:11,005
I don't have to stay alive
that much longer anyway.

550
00:36:15,683 --> 00:36:18,151
Rotten way to kill a man, but it's quiet.

551
00:36:24,092 --> 00:36:27,186
Hate yourself later.

552
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:37,365
(slapping)

553
00:36:38,806 --> 00:36:41,832
You're only making this worse for yourself,
you stupid cow!

554
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:53,353
Do you think I'm tired?

555
00:36:53,421 --> 00:36:55,582
Is that it?
Do you think I'm getting tired?

556
00:36:55,657 --> 00:36:58,057
You're the one who's gonna crack!

557
00:36:58,126 --> 00:37:00,117
You'll crack!

558
00:37:00,195 --> 00:37:03,221
You'll cry and beg!

559
00:37:03,298 --> 00:37:05,027
You'll scream!

560
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:09,832
Oh, yeah, you'll scream,
you big, fat, ugly cow!

561
00:37:09,904 --> 00:37:11,394
You'll scream!

562
00:37:17,011 --> 00:37:19,571
You're thinking the whip
was the worst I could do?

563
00:37:20,181 --> 00:37:22,672
Thatwas foreplay.

564
00:37:23,718 --> 00:37:26,653
Hartigan was right about you.

565
00:37:26,721 --> 00:37:29,189
You can't get it up unless I scream.

566
00:37:30,858 --> 00:37:32,621
You're pathetic!

567
00:37:33,928 --> 00:37:36,021
You're pathetic.

568
00:37:38,399 --> 00:37:41,493
It's not wise at all
to make fun of me like that.

569
00:37:42,971 --> 00:37:45,439
It brings out the worst in me.

570
00:37:52,046 --> 00:37:53,809
Stupid old man!

571
00:37:53,881 --> 00:37:56,042
In too much of a hurry.

572
00:37:57,652 --> 00:38:00,553
Damn!
It can't be!

573
00:38:01,055 --> 00:38:04,582
Charging in like Galahad.
just like I told myself I wouldn't!

574
00:38:04,659 --> 00:38:05,956
Stupid old man!

575
00:38:06,027 --> 00:38:10,225
- You tagged him good!
- Don't take no chances. Perforate the fool.

576
00:38:14,969 --> 00:38:16,800
Good advice.

577
00:38:27,048 --> 00:38:29,278
Give it up, Junior.

578
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,341
It's over.
Let her go.

579
00:38:31,419 --> 00:38:33,148
You're dreaming, Hartigan!

580
00:38:33,221 --> 00:38:38,158
I get to see your eyes while I fillet the
woman of your dreams right in front of you!

581
00:38:38,226 --> 00:38:41,423
Look at you!
You're about to keel over!

582
00:38:41,496 --> 00:38:44,260
You can't even lift that cannon!

583
00:38:44,332 --> 00:38:46,698
Sure, I can.

584
00:38:49,837 --> 00:38:51,464
(laughs)

585
00:38:53,641 --> 00:38:56,303
You gave me a scare there
for a second there, old man.

586
00:38:56,377 --> 00:38:59,312
Nancy, I'm sorry.

587
00:39:00,014 --> 00:39:02,812
I'm taking no chances with you.

588
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,847
First I soften you up,
and then it's showtime.

589
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,494
Here it comes.

590
00:39:16,097 --> 00:39:17,928
It's gonna hurt.

591
00:39:17,999 --> 00:39:20,024
You're right about that.

592
00:39:23,871 --> 00:39:25,805
Sucker.

593
00:39:29,077 --> 00:39:30,874
I take away his weapon.

594
00:39:32,814 --> 00:39:34,179
Both of them.

595
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:36,648
(screaming)

596
00:39:45,993 --> 00:39:49,724
Eight long years, son of a bitch!

597
00:39:50,765 --> 00:39:54,724
After a while, all I'm doing is pounding
wet chunks of bone into the floorboards.

598
00:39:54,802 --> 00:39:55,996
so I stop.

599
00:39:57,538 --> 00:40:00,029
So long, Junior.

600
00:40:00,108 --> 00:40:02,633
Been a pleasure.

601
00:40:08,015 --> 00:40:11,507
I didn't scream, Hartigan, not once.

602
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,512
I didn't scream.

603
00:40:14,589 --> 00:40:16,750
I know it, baby.

604
00:40:16,824 --> 00:40:19,156
You grew up strong.

605
00:40:30,605 --> 00:40:33,972
By the time I get her to the car.
Nancy stops shaking.

606
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:37,977
Her skin is warm again.
She's herself again.

607
00:40:38,045 --> 00:40:40,513
Thanks for remembering my coat.

608
00:40:41,849 --> 00:40:43,942
And  for all the  little  things.

609
00:40:44,619 --> 00:40:48,111
Like saving my life, twice.

610
00:40:49,123 --> 00:40:52,217
- You better get rolling.
- You're not coming along?

611
00:40:52,293 --> 00:40:57,253
No. I have friends on their way,
to collect evidence.

612
00:40:57,331 --> 00:41:00,061
I'm gonna blow
this whole sick mess wide open.

613
00:41:00,134 --> 00:41:02,466
I'm gonna clear my name.

614
00:41:02,537 --> 00:41:06,598
I'm gonna put Senator Roark
behind bars where he belongs.

615
00:41:06,674 --> 00:41:10,303
I can't lose you, not again.

616
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,672
You'll never lose me, Nancy.

617
00:41:28,362 --> 00:41:32,162
Nancy Callahan, the love of my life.

618
00:41:33,568 --> 00:41:38,062
Shame to lie to her.
I hope she forgives me for it.

619
00:41:38,139 --> 00:41:41,734
Get Senator Roark behind bars?
Sure.

620
00:41:41,809 --> 00:41:45,370
And maybe after I've pulled off
that miracle, I'll go and punch out God.

621
00:41:45,446 --> 00:41:49,246
There isn't a prosecutor in the state
who'll go after Senator Roark.

622
00:41:49,317 --> 00:41:51,478
I killed his only son.

623
00:41:51,552 --> 00:41:53,679
The bloodline is cut.

624
00:41:53,754 --> 00:41:56,552
Roark's lost his goddamn legacy.

625
00:41:56,757 --> 00:41:59,453
He'll use all his power
to get revenge on me.

626
00:41:59,527 --> 00:42:03,122
He'll go after me through Nancy.
He'll find her again.

627
00:42:03,598 --> 00:42:05,691
There'll be no end to it.

628
00:42:05,766 --> 00:42:07,961
She'll never be safe.

629
00:42:08,035 --> 00:42:10,629
Not as long as I'm alive.

630
00:42:10,705 --> 00:42:13,299
There's only one way to beat him.

631
00:42:13,941 --> 00:42:16,603
An old man dies.

632
00:42:16,677 --> 00:42:18,907
a young woman lives.

633
00:42:20,014 --> 00:42:22,278
Fair trade.

634
00:42:25,219 --> 00:42:28,154
I love you, Nancy.

635
00:47:47,416 --> 00:47:51,045
(man) She shivers in the wind
like the last leaf on a dying tree.

636
00:47:55,157 --> 00:47:57,751
I let her hear my footsteps.

637
00:48:00,229 --> 00:48:03,027
She only goes stiff for a moment.

638
00:48:03,098 --> 00:48:05,896
Care for a smoke?

639
00:48:08,136 --> 00:48:11,765
Sure.
I'll take one.

640
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,468
Are you as bored by that crowd as I am?

641
00:48:15,577 --> 00:48:19,911
I didn't come here for the party.
I came here for you.

642
00:48:21,717 --> 00:48:24,481
I've watched you for days.

643
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:29,286
You're everything a man could ever want.

644
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:31,826
It's not just your face,

645
00:48:31,894 --> 00:48:36,490
your figure, or your voice.

646
00:48:39,735 --> 00:48:41,532
It's your eyes.

647
00:48:42,971 --> 00:48:46,270
All the  things I see in  your  eyes.

648
00:48:48,543 --> 00:48:50,943
What is it you see in my eyes?

649
00:48:55,484 --> 00:48:58,180
I see a crazy calm.

650
00:48:59,922 --> 00:49:01,913
You're sick of running.

651
00:49:04,226 --> 00:49:07,218
You're ready to face what you have to face.

652
00:49:07,663 --> 00:49:11,155
But you don't want to face it alone.

653
00:49:11,233 --> 00:49:13,258
No.

654
00:49:13,335 --> 00:49:15,530
I don't want to face it alone.

655
00:49:23,278 --> 00:49:26,213
The wind rises electric.

656
00:49:26,281 --> 00:49:29,944
She's soft and warm
and almost weightless.

657
00:49:30,018 --> 00:49:34,011
Her perfume a sweet promise
that brings tears to my eyes.

658
00:49:35,524 --> 00:49:38,084
I tell her that everything will be all right.

659
00:49:39,928 --> 00:49:44,831
That I'll save her from whatever
she's scared of and take her far, far away.

660
00:49:47,736 --> 00:49:51,172
I tell her I love her.

661
00:49:51,273 --> 00:49:53,264
(gunshot through silencer)

662
00:49:54,876 --> 00:49:58,073
The silencer
makes a whisper of the gunshot.

663
00:50:00,215 --> 00:50:02,979
I hold her close until she's gone.

664
00:50:05,721 --> 00:50:08,519
I'll never know
what she was running from.

665
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:13,821
I'll cash her check in the morning.

666
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:46,550
(girl) Yes.

667
00:50:46,628 --> 00:50:49,062
Oh, Mom, don't go on like that.

668
00:50:49,131 --> 00:50:54,296
It's not the city. I could've gotten
in a traffic accident anywhere.

669
00:50:54,369 --> 00:50:57,964
Yeah, just a fracture.
The doctor said it's a clean break.

670
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,474
It should be right as rain in no time.

671
00:51:04,179 --> 00:51:06,204
Uh-huh.

672
00:51:14,823 --> 00:51:16,814
Mm-hm.

673
00:51:19,694 --> 00:51:23,027
(man) Turn the right corner in Sin City

674
00:51:23,098 --> 00:51:27,592
and you can find anything.

675
00:51:27,669 --> 00:51:29,364
Becky.

676
00:51:31,406 --> 00:51:34,068
Care for a smoke?

677
00:51:36,111 --> 00:51:38,341
Love you, too, Mom.

678
00:51:40,661 --> 00:51:41,310
Anything.

679
00:56:08,118 --> 00:56:10,484
(man) The night is hot as hell.

680
00:56:10,554 --> 00:56:13,853
It's a lousy room
in a lousy part of a lousy town.

681
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:17,525
I'm staring at a goddess.

682
00:56:17,594 --> 00:56:20,028
She's telling me she wants me.

683
00:56:20,097 --> 00:56:23,931
I'm not gonna waste one more second
wondering how I've gotten so lucky.

684
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,592
I want you.

685
00:56:28,338 --> 00:56:31,171
She smells like angels ought to smell.

686
00:56:35,145 --> 00:56:36,806
The perfect woman.

687
00:56:41,418 --> 00:56:42,680
The goddess.

688
00:56:47,591 --> 00:56:49,286
I need you.

689
00:56:51,628 --> 00:56:53,687
Goldie.

690
00:56:53,764 --> 00:56:56,198
She says her name is Goldie.

691
00:57:04,141 --> 00:57:07,668
Three hours later and my head
is feeling several sizes too big.

692
00:57:07,744 --> 00:57:10,838
And that cold thing
happens to my stomach.

693
00:57:10,914 --> 00:57:15,010
And I realize Goldie's dead.
Not a mark on her.

694
00:57:15,085 --> 00:57:18,418
You'd have to check her pulse
or notice those perfect breasts of hers

695
00:57:18,488 --> 00:57:21,252
aren't moving like they would
if she was breathing.

696
00:57:21,324 --> 00:57:24,191
She was murdered
and I was right here when it happened.

697
00:57:24,261 --> 00:57:28,698
Lying next to her.
stone drunk. just like she was.

698
00:57:29,166 --> 00:57:33,193
Damn it. Goldie. Who were you
and who wanted you dead?

699
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:35,670
Who were you
besides an angel of mercy.

700
00:57:35,739 --> 00:57:39,072
giving a two-time loser like me
the night of his life?

701
00:57:39,142 --> 00:57:41,940
It sure as hell wasn't my looks.

702
00:57:42,012 --> 00:57:44,947
So why the sleazy saloon?

703
00:57:45,015 --> 00:57:47,381
Why the kindness. Goldie?

704
00:57:47,451 --> 00:57:49,442
(sirens blaring)

705
00:57:49,519 --> 00:57:53,080
The cops - they're telling me too much.

706
00:57:53,156 --> 00:57:55,056
showing up before anybody
but me and the killer

707
00:57:55,125 --> 00:57:57,355
could know there's been a murder.

708
00:57:57,427 --> 00:58:00,954
Somebody paid good money
for this frame.

709
00:58:01,431 --> 00:58:03,797
No reason at all to play it quiet.

710
00:58:03,867 --> 00:58:06,995
No reason to play it any way but my way.

711
00:58:11,475 --> 00:58:14,569
Whoever killed you is gonna pay. Goldie.

712
00:58:19,416 --> 00:58:21,611
(man banging on door)
Open up, police!

713
00:58:21,685 --> 00:58:23,448
I'll be right out.

714
00:58:31,995 --> 00:58:34,088
(gunfire)

715
00:58:42,539 --> 00:58:44,973
(sirens blaring)

716
00:58:52,949 --> 00:58:55,315
I don't know why you died. Goldie.

717
00:58:58,121 --> 00:59:02,490
I don't know why and I don't know how
I never even met you before tonight.

718
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:06,325
but you were a friend and more
when I needed one.

719
00:59:06,396 --> 00:59:09,092
And when I find out who did it.

720
00:59:09,165 --> 00:59:12,259
it won't be quick and quiet
like it was with you.

721
00:59:12,335 --> 00:59:16,032
It'll be loud and nasty - my kind of kill.

722
00:59:16,106 --> 00:59:19,075
And when his eyes go dead.
the hell I send him to

723
00:59:19,142 --> 00:59:22,737
will seem like heaven
after what I've done to him.

724
00:59:22,812 --> 00:59:24,211
I love you. Goldie.

725
00:59:31,087 --> 00:59:32,452
(sirens blaring)

726
00:59:32,522 --> 00:59:35,889
(helicopter overhead)

727
00:59:35,959 --> 00:59:38,689
(sirens continue blaring)

728
00:59:44,701 --> 00:59:46,032
(latch squeaks)

729
00:59:46,102 --> 00:59:48,536
Claire?

730
00:59:57,914 --> 01:00:01,907
Now, don't worry, Lucille.
I was just grazed.

731
01:00:01,985 --> 01:00:06,922
- You got any beers around this place?
- No way am I giving you any alcohol.

732
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:11,120
Besides, it's not what
you came here for anyway, is it?

733
01:00:11,194 --> 01:00:12,889
No.

734
01:00:12,963 --> 01:00:15,523
Go ahead.
You're worse without 'em.

735
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:17,897
Thanks.
You're the best.

736
01:00:18,401 --> 01:00:20,528
Lucille's my parole officer.

737
01:00:20,604 --> 01:00:22,799
She's a dyke, but God knows why.

738
01:00:22,872 --> 01:00:26,399
With that body of hers
she could have any man she wants.

739
01:00:26,476 --> 01:00:29,570
The pills come from a girlfriend
who's a shrink.

740
01:00:29,646 --> 01:00:33,446
She tried to analyze me once
but she got too scared.

741
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:37,583
Haven't seen you like this in a while.

742
01:00:37,654 --> 01:00:41,112
- Got in a fight with some cops.
- Didn't happen to kill any of them, did ya?

743
01:00:41,191 --> 01:00:45,753
Not that I know of. But they know they've
been in a fight, that's for damn sure.

744
01:00:45,829 --> 01:00:48,593
How the hell do you suppose
I'm gonna square this with the board?

745
01:00:48,665 --> 01:00:51,691
There ain't no squaring it.
Not this time.

746
01:00:51,768 --> 01:00:54,430
This isn't some barroom brawl.

747
01:00:54,504 --> 01:00:57,701
Or some creep with a gas can
trying to torch someone.

748
01:00:57,774 --> 01:00:59,366
Hey, hey.
This is big.

749
01:00:59,442 --> 01:01:03,208
- Settle down, Marv. Take another pill.
- Hey, there ain't no settlin' down!

750
01:01:03,279 --> 01:01:06,271
This is blood for blood, and by the gallons.

751
01:01:06,349 --> 01:01:10,843
This is the old days and the bad days,
the all-or-nothing days.

752
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:14,048
They're back.
There's no choices left.

753
01:01:14,124 --> 01:01:15,921
And I'm ready for war.

754
01:01:15,992 --> 01:01:18,483
Prison was hell for you, Marv.
It's gonna be life this time.

755
01:01:18,561 --> 01:01:19,994
Ah.

756
01:01:20,063 --> 01:01:24,124
Hell's waking up every goddamn day
and not even knowing why you're here.

757
01:01:25,602 --> 01:01:27,263
But I'm out now.

758
01:01:27,337 --> 01:01:30,864
It took somebody who was kind to me
getting killed to do it.

759
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:35,001
But I'm out.
I know exactly what I gotta do.

760
01:01:37,781 --> 01:01:40,682
Now for Gladys.
Sweet Gladys.

761
01:01:41,351 --> 01:01:43,717
But I'll have to sneak past Mom.

762
01:01:43,787 --> 01:01:47,951
And her ears have gotten
a whole lot better since she went blind.

763
01:01:51,628 --> 01:01:54,688
Mom still hasn't changed
a thing in this room.

764
01:01:54,764 --> 01:02:00,293
Every week she dusts it all off so it looks
like it was only yesterday that I moved out.

765
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:03,168
Every time I come visit.
she has me sleepin' here.

766
01:02:03,239 --> 01:02:06,572
and the old smells make me
cry like they do right now.

767
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:09,735
I knew Gladys would be safe here.

768
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:13,708
I call her Gladys
after one of the sisters from school.

769
01:02:13,783 --> 01:02:16,115
She's almost lived up to the name.

770
01:02:16,653 --> 01:02:21,317
For a while we just get the feel
of each other back. Good as ever.

771
01:02:21,391 --> 01:02:23,882
I tell her about Goldie.
and what we have to do.

772
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:25,291
(creak)

773
01:02:25,361 --> 01:02:27,124
Marvin?

774
01:02:27,697 --> 01:02:29,824
Is that you, baby?

775
01:02:29,899 --> 01:02:32,163
Yes, Mom.
I'm sorry I woke you up.

776
01:02:32,235 --> 01:02:36,695
I couldn't sleep for the worry.
There were men here lookin' for you.

777
01:02:36,773 --> 01:02:39,003
They weren't police.

778
01:02:39,075 --> 01:02:41,202
It was about my job.

779
01:02:41,277 --> 01:02:45,907
I got a new job.
It's night work.

780
01:02:45,982 --> 01:02:48,542
What did you do to your face?

781
01:02:48,618 --> 01:02:51,143
I cut myself shaving.

782
01:02:51,221 --> 01:02:55,351
You're getting confused
again, aren't you?

783
01:02:55,425 --> 01:03:00,124
Mom, I feel better
than I have in years.

784
01:03:02,098 --> 01:03:03,998
(helicopter)

785
01:03:04,067 --> 01:03:06,467
So you were scared.
weren't you. Goldie?

786
01:03:06,536 --> 01:03:09,198
Somebody wanted you dead
and you knew it.

787
01:03:09,272 --> 01:03:12,036
So you hit the saloons,
the bad places,

788
01:03:12,108 --> 01:03:16,408
looking for the biggest,
meanest lug around and finding me.

789
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:19,141
Well, I'm gonna find
that son of a bitch that killed you,

790
01:03:19,215 --> 01:03:22,184
and I'm gonna give him the hard goodbye.

791
01:03:23,453 --> 01:03:26,513
Walk down
the right back alley in Sin City...

792
01:03:26,589 --> 01:03:29,820
- Leave your hands off Nancy.
-...and you could find anything.

793
01:03:29,893 --> 01:03:32,589
That coat looks like Baghdad.

794
01:03:32,662 --> 01:03:36,223
So does your face.
Take off!

795
01:03:36,299 --> 01:03:38,096
(yelling)

796
01:03:41,004 --> 01:03:44,098
He's new here, Marv.
He didn't know.

797
01:03:44,174 --> 01:03:46,608
Kadie's is my kind of joint.

798
01:03:48,411 --> 01:03:52,347
Nancy's just getting started with her gig.
but already the crowd's breathing hard.

799
01:03:52,415 --> 01:03:54,440
Plenty of nights I've drooled over Nancy,

800
01:03:54,517 --> 01:03:57,975
shoulder to shoulder
with all the other losers like me.

801
01:03:58,054 --> 01:04:00,921
But that's not what I'm lookin' for tonight.

802
01:04:00,990 --> 01:04:04,221
I'm looking for something small and hairy.

803
01:04:08,331 --> 01:04:12,267
Take it easy, Weevil.
I'm here to do you a favor.

804
01:04:12,335 --> 01:04:14,803
It's money in your pocket.

805
01:04:16,506 --> 01:04:20,499
Spread the word. Tell 'em I've been
hitting the joints, drunk off my butt,

806
01:04:20,577 --> 01:04:25,071
shooting my mouth off, cryin' over
some hot babe named Goldie.

807
01:04:38,661 --> 01:04:40,151
What'll it be, Marv?

808
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:43,131
A shot and a brew Shellie,
and keep 'em comin'.

809
01:04:43,199 --> 01:04:46,862
Sure, honey.
You take it slow, now.

810
01:05:01,551 --> 01:05:04,645
(man) Most people think Marv is crazy.

811
01:05:04,721 --> 01:05:08,452
He just had the rotten luck
of being born in the wrong century.

812
01:05:08,524 --> 01:05:10,958
He'd be right at home
on some ancient battlefield.

813
01:05:11,027 --> 01:05:13,427
swinging an ax into somebody's face.

814
01:05:13,930 --> 01:05:18,424
Or in a Roman arena
taking a sword to other gladiators like him.

815
01:05:18,501 --> 01:05:22,403
They'd have tossed him girls
like Nancy back then.

816
01:05:25,174 --> 01:05:27,972
Show's over, dickwad.
Drink up.

817
01:05:28,044 --> 01:05:30,945
Now, that's one fine-looking coat
you're wearing there.

818
01:05:33,950 --> 01:05:38,649
Your killin' days are over,
you over-the-hill, do-gooder son of a bitch.

819
01:05:38,721 --> 01:05:43,715
I love hit men. No matter what
you do to them. you don't feel bad.

820
01:05:51,734 --> 01:05:54,134
- Take it off.
- What?

821
01:05:54,203 --> 01:05:56,637
A fine coat like that,
and you're bleeding all over it.

822
01:05:56,706 --> 01:05:59,197
All right, it's all yours.
Oh, God!

823
01:05:59,275 --> 01:06:02,870
It wasn't you losers who killed Goldie.

824
01:06:02,946 --> 01:06:07,406
The guy who did that,
he knew what he was doing.

825
01:06:08,518 --> 01:06:10,748
So tell me, man.
Who sent you?

826
01:06:13,890 --> 01:06:16,120
I don't hear you giving me any names.

827
01:06:16,192 --> 01:06:19,787
So I guess when I shot you in the belly
I aimed a little too high.

828
01:06:19,862 --> 01:06:21,227
(screams)

829
01:06:22,765 --> 01:06:27,532
You keep holding out on me like this,
and I'm gonna have to get really nasty.

830
01:06:31,341 --> 01:06:36,210
It was Telly...
Telly Stern passed me the order.

831
01:06:37,146 --> 01:06:40,206
He runs the tables over
to the Triple Ace Club.

832
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:43,641
Thanks again.

833
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:45,278
(gunshot)

834
01:06:48,925 --> 01:06:50,825
Then the damnedest thing happens.

835
01:06:50,893 --> 01:06:55,023
For a second. I smell the angel smell
that belonged to my Goldie.

836
01:06:55,098 --> 01:06:57,589
Just need my medicine. is all.

837
01:06:58,101 --> 01:06:59,796
Bastard.

838
01:06:59,869 --> 01:07:03,032
You're gonna pay for what you did to me.

839
01:07:05,908 --> 01:07:07,603
Feel like talking, Louie?

840
01:07:07,677 --> 01:07:10,168
How many got paid off
for the frame, Louie? Huh?

841
01:07:10,246 --> 01:07:12,009
How many for the kill?

842
01:07:12,081 --> 01:07:14,675
It was Connelly.
He set me up.

843
01:07:17,253 --> 01:07:19,278
He'll never talk.

844
01:07:22,258 --> 01:07:25,455
I don't know about you,
but I'm havin' a ball.

845
01:07:26,729 --> 01:07:30,665
Connelly talks.
They all talk.

846
01:07:31,567 --> 01:07:33,865
(man) And what have been
your sins, my son?

847
01:07:33,936 --> 01:07:36,496
(Marv) Well, Padre,
I don't want to keep you up all night,

848
01:07:36,572 --> 01:07:39,632
so I'll just fill you in on the latest batch.

849
01:07:39,709 --> 01:07:42,701
These here hands of mine,
they got blood all over 'em.

850
01:07:42,779 --> 01:07:44,906
You're speaking figuratively.

851
01:07:44,981 --> 01:07:49,577
When I need to find something out,
I just go out and Iook for somebody

852
01:07:49,652 --> 01:07:52,143
that knows more than me,
and I go and I ask them.

853
01:07:52,221 --> 01:07:55,418
Sometimes, I ask pretty hard.

854
01:07:55,491 --> 01:08:01,430
By way of a "for instance",
I killed three men tonight.

855
01:08:01,497 --> 01:08:02,862
Tortured 'em first.

856
01:08:02,932 --> 01:08:07,266
You might say I been
working my way up the food chain.

857
01:08:07,336 --> 01:08:10,134
First two were minnows -
small-time messengers.

858
01:08:10,206 --> 01:08:15,075
But it was Connelly, the money man,
who fingered you, Padre.

859
01:08:15,144 --> 01:08:17,874
(whispering) Dear Lord, man,
this is a house of God.

860
01:08:17,947 --> 01:08:21,713
Just give me a damn name.

861
01:08:21,784 --> 01:08:25,117
- Roark.
- You really are pushing your luck, Padre,

862
01:08:25,188 --> 01:08:28,123
feeding me garbage like that.

863
01:08:28,191 --> 01:08:29,419
It can't be that big.

864
01:08:29,492 --> 01:08:31,790
There's a farm
at North Cross and Lennox.

865
01:08:31,861 --> 01:08:34,796
It's all there.
Find out for yourself.

866
01:08:34,864 --> 01:08:36,832
And while you're at it,

867
01:08:36,899 --> 01:08:42,269
ask yourself if that corpse of a slut
is worth dying for.

868
01:08:42,705 --> 01:08:44,764
Worth dying for.

869
01:08:44,841 --> 01:08:46,866
Worth killing for.

870
01:08:46,943 --> 01:08:49,309
Worth going to hell for.

871
01:08:49,378 --> 01:08:51,312
Amen.

872
01:08:54,817 --> 01:08:57,752
His keys say the padre drove a Mercedes.

873
01:08:57,820 --> 01:09:01,381
or at least that's what they're
passing off as a Mercedes these days.

874
01:09:01,457 --> 01:09:05,553
Modern cars -
they all look like electric shavers.

875
01:09:05,628 --> 01:09:08,256
(tires screeching)

876
01:09:12,168 --> 01:09:13,795
Goldie.

877
01:09:16,506 --> 01:09:17,768
Goldie!

878
01:09:28,518 --> 01:09:30,713
It couldn't be Goldie.

879
01:09:30,786 --> 01:09:35,086
It's my own fault. and nobody else's.
that I got confused.

880
01:09:35,158 --> 01:09:38,924
I've been having so much fun
I forgot to take my medicine.

881
01:09:38,995 --> 01:09:40,929
That wasn't Goldie back there.

882
01:09:40,997 --> 01:09:42,430
Goldie's dead.

883
01:09:42,498 --> 01:09:46,457
and that's the whole reason
that I've been doing what I've been doing.

884
01:09:46,536 --> 01:09:50,336
When you got a condition.
it's bad to forget your medicine.

885
01:09:53,142 --> 01:09:58,637
The cold thing. it creeps into my gut
and tells me one more time it won't let go.

886
01:09:59,415 --> 01:10:02,077
This is a bad place. this farm.

887
01:10:02,151 --> 01:10:03,880
People have died here...

888
01:10:03,953 --> 01:10:05,614
(growling)

889
01:10:05,688 --> 01:10:07,349
... the wrong way.

890
01:10:10,059 --> 01:10:12,050
I don't want to fight, pooch.

891
01:10:15,598 --> 01:10:17,862
I got no gripe with you.

892
01:10:20,269 --> 01:10:22,066
Easy, boy.

893
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:24,267
(dog whimpers)

894
01:10:25,107 --> 01:10:28,008
No way I was gonna use
my gun on you. buddy.

895
01:10:28,077 --> 01:10:30,807
It's whoever owns you I'm curious about.

896
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:34,941
because there's blood on your breath.
and I think I know what kind.

897
01:10:35,451 --> 01:10:37,749
So I sniff around to see what's buried.

898
01:10:41,657 --> 01:10:43,124
Here we go.

899
01:10:48,431 --> 01:10:51,525
It's impossible.
Nobody can sneak up on me.

900
01:10:57,173 --> 01:11:02,042
I go blind.
Not a sound. Nobody's that quiet.

901
01:11:02,111 --> 01:11:05,740
Nobody except the one who snuck
into that hotel room two nights ago.

902
01:11:06,148 --> 01:11:09,777
It was you, you bastard.
You killed her.

903
01:11:10,253 --> 01:11:12,380
You killed Goldie.

904
01:11:12,455 --> 01:11:14,116
It was...

905
01:11:15,691 --> 01:11:17,249
I blew it Goldie.

906
01:11:17,893 --> 01:11:20,418
I found your killer.
but he was better than me.

907
01:11:20,997 --> 01:11:23,056
Too quiet. too quick.

908
01:11:23,132 --> 01:11:25,623
A killer born.

909
01:11:25,701 --> 01:11:28,192
Why didn't he finish the job?

910
01:11:41,217 --> 01:11:44,948
He keeps the heads.
He eats the rest.

911
01:11:45,021 --> 01:11:48,388
- Lucille?
- It's not just that wolf of his.

912
01:11:50,126 --> 01:11:53,289
The wolf just gets scraps.

913
01:11:53,362 --> 01:11:55,353
Bones.

914
01:11:55,431 --> 01:11:57,763
It's him.

915
01:11:57,833 --> 01:12:02,327
He eats people.

916
01:12:03,239 --> 01:12:06,766
- He cooks them like they were steaks.
- Let's get you warm.

917
01:12:06,842 --> 01:12:09,106
Just like they were steaks.

918
01:12:09,178 --> 01:12:11,510
Now he's got both of us.

919
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:14,811
It's all right.
Take a nice, slow breath.

920
01:12:15,584 --> 01:12:18,451
Just look at the heads on the wall.

921
01:12:18,521 --> 01:12:20,648
The heads on the wall.

922
01:12:21,290 --> 01:12:23,281
The heads on the wall.

923
01:12:23,359 --> 01:12:27,318
Son of a bitch!
He kept smiling that damned smile.

924
01:12:27,396 --> 01:12:31,526
He made me watch him
suck the meat off my fingers.

925
01:12:32,001 --> 01:12:34,333
- He made me watch!
- Oh, Jesus.

926
01:12:34,403 --> 01:12:39,340
He made me watch!

927
01:12:46,849 --> 01:12:49,215
Christ, I could use a cigarette.

928
01:12:49,952 --> 01:12:53,820
Dames.
Sometimes all they gotta do is let it out.

929
01:12:53,889 --> 01:12:57,188
And a few buckets later.
there's no way you'd know.

930
01:12:57,793 --> 01:12:59,920
You've brought us
some big trouble this time, Marv.

931
01:12:59,995 --> 01:13:04,625
Whoever's behind this whole thing has
his connections right in the department.

932
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:06,930
Any leads?

933
01:13:07,002 --> 01:13:10,733
One guy I talked to told me
it was Roark running the show.

934
01:13:10,806 --> 01:13:15,641
Whoever it is, he knew I was checking out
that hooker almost before I did.

935
01:13:15,711 --> 01:13:19,340
- What hooker?
- The one you've been obsessing over.

936
01:13:19,415 --> 01:13:21,542
The dead one.

937
01:13:21,617 --> 01:13:23,812
Goldie.

938
01:13:23,886 --> 01:13:26,354
I didn't know she was a hooker.

939
01:13:26,422 --> 01:13:29,585
Doesn't make any difference
about anything.

940
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:36,293
- But I didn't know that.
- She was high-class stuff.

941
01:13:36,365 --> 01:13:38,026
She must have shown you quite a time.

942
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:40,261
Quiet.
There's a car coming.

943
01:13:44,173 --> 01:13:46,641
(man) Kevin!

944
01:13:47,643 --> 01:13:51,443
All I've got is a face... and a name.

945
01:13:51,514 --> 01:13:53,505
I'll see you later, Kevin.

946
01:14:03,492 --> 01:14:04,618
Let's go.

947
01:14:21,477 --> 01:14:23,308
They're done checking the house.

948
01:14:23,379 --> 01:14:25,404
They're coming this way.

949
01:14:25,481 --> 01:14:28,575
Bastards.
I'll show them.

950
01:14:33,656 --> 01:14:37,752
You're not gonna get
either of us killed, Marv.

951
01:14:37,827 --> 01:14:40,557
No, don't shoot!
Please.

952
01:14:40,629 --> 01:14:42,893
Listen to me.
I'm his parole officer.

953
01:14:42,965 --> 01:14:45,433
He's unconscious and unarmed,

954
01:14:45,501 --> 01:14:48,493
so there's no need to kill him.

955
01:14:54,743 --> 01:14:57,007
Captain, the target - there's no sign of him.

956
01:14:57,079 --> 01:14:58,307
Here's a sign!

957
01:15:13,062 --> 01:15:16,793
That there is one
damn fine coat you're wearing.

958
01:15:24,406 --> 01:15:28,035
I keep coming back to that cop I just killed
and what he told me.

959
01:15:28,110 --> 01:15:30,908
I was pretty steamed about
what he'd done to Lucille.

960
01:15:30,980 --> 01:15:33,540
so I took my time
with that son of a bitch.

961
01:15:34,116 --> 01:15:37,882
It wasn't till I showed him
all those pieces of himself that he said it.

962
01:15:38,454 --> 01:15:43,619
Just a name -
Patrick Henry Roark, man of the cloth.

963
01:15:43,692 --> 01:15:46,786
Could've become president.
but he chose to serve God.

964
01:15:46,862 --> 01:15:51,390
Along the way he happened to become
the most powerful man in the state.

965
01:15:51,467 --> 01:15:55,403
He's brought down mayors and governors
like they were nothing.

966
01:15:55,471 --> 01:15:59,066
He even made his rotten brother
a US senator without breaking a sweat.

967
01:15:59,642 --> 01:16:04,204
And here he's gonna get killed
in the name of a dead hooker.

968
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:09,183
I'm getting used to the idea.
More and more. I'm liking the sound of it.

969
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:14,382
Then it hits me like a kick in the nuts.

970
01:16:14,456 --> 01:16:16,321
What if I'm wrong?

971
01:16:16,392 --> 01:16:18,257
I've got a condition.

972
01:16:18,327 --> 01:16:20,488
I get confused sometimes.

973
01:16:20,563 --> 01:16:24,499
And with Lucille dead.
I can't get my medicine.

974
01:16:24,567 --> 01:16:26,762
What if I've imagined all of this?

975
01:16:26,835 --> 01:16:32,137
What if I've finally turned into what
they've always said I was gonna turn into?

976
01:16:32,207 --> 01:16:34,607
A maniac.

977
01:16:34,677 --> 01:16:37,077
A psycho killer.

978
01:16:37,146 --> 01:16:40,274
Can't kill a man
without knowing for sure you ought to.

979
01:16:40,349 --> 01:16:42,374
I've gotta know for sure.

980
01:16:45,454 --> 01:16:49,948
The merchandise is on display
by the time I make my way to Old Town.

981
01:16:50,025 --> 01:16:52,755
For an hour or so.
I asked around about Goldie.

982
01:16:52,828 --> 01:16:55,626
I don't get any answers.
but I know I'm bound to.

983
01:16:55,698 --> 01:16:57,825
Lucille said Goldie was a hooker,

984
01:16:57,900 --> 01:17:00,733
and if she was she has roots here -

985
01:17:00,803 --> 01:17:03,636
friends, maybe even family.

986
01:17:08,344 --> 01:17:11,438
You can't be Goldie.
Goldie's dead.

987
01:17:21,323 --> 01:17:22,483
Ha.

988
01:17:22,558 --> 01:17:25,857
Goldie.
Yeah, sure, right.

989
01:17:25,928 --> 01:17:29,989
I haven't eaten anything
or taken my medicine for days now.

990
01:17:30,065 --> 01:17:32,625
No wonder I'm seeing things.

991
01:17:32,701 --> 01:17:34,168
Bastard!

992
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:39,835
(Marv laughing)

993
01:17:39,908 --> 01:17:41,808
He's crazy.

994
01:17:41,877 --> 01:17:44,937
Hit him again, Wendy.
Harder.

995
01:17:46,582 --> 01:17:48,982
Wait a minute.
Why did she call you Wendy?

996
01:17:49,051 --> 01:17:51,383
Because that's my name, you ape.

997
01:17:51,987 --> 01:17:56,390
Goldie was my sister.
My twin sister.

998
01:17:56,458 --> 01:17:58,824
I guess she was the nice one.

999
01:18:05,067 --> 01:18:08,696
Goldie and the other six - where are they?

1000
01:18:08,771 --> 01:18:10,762
What did you do to them?

1001
01:18:10,839 --> 01:18:13,307
You crazy goddamn broad.

1002
01:18:13,375 --> 01:18:15,366
Just take a look at this mug.

1003
01:18:15,444 --> 01:18:19,642
Would any of you dames let me get
close enough to you to kill you?

1004
01:18:19,715 --> 01:18:23,344
None of you would, but Goldie.

1005
01:18:23,419 --> 01:18:26,582
And she only did because
she thought I could protect her.

1006
01:18:26,655 --> 01:18:31,888
And I'll bet those cops didn't do a damn
thing about those other girls, did they?

1007
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:37,057
But as soon as they had me for a fall guy,
they showed up, guns blazing.

1008
01:18:37,666 --> 01:18:42,569
But they didn't get me, and I've been killing
my way to the truth ever since.

1009
01:18:42,638 --> 01:18:46,301
So, go ahead, doll.

1010
01:18:46,375 --> 01:18:51,108
Shoot me now,
or get the hell out of my way.

1011
01:18:57,886 --> 01:19:00,081
Aw,  nuts

1012
01:19:00,622 --> 01:19:03,489
OK, I'm glad we got all that sorted out.

1013
01:19:04,893 --> 01:19:09,660
- What the hell?
- I tied those knots! That's my specialty!

1014
01:19:09,732 --> 01:19:11,597
You sat there and took it,

1015
01:19:11,667 --> 01:19:14,636
when you could've taken my gun away
from me any time you wanted to.

1016
01:19:14,703 --> 01:19:19,197
Well, sure. I thought I might be able
to talk some sense into you.

1017
01:19:19,274 --> 01:19:22,539
And I probably would have had
to paste you one,

1018
01:19:22,611 --> 01:19:24,704
and I don't hurt girls.

1019
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:27,109
I need a pair of handcuffs.

1020
01:19:27,182 --> 01:19:30,242
What style do you want?
I got a collection.

1021
01:19:30,319 --> 01:19:34,255
Just give him the ones
you got with you, Gail.

1022
01:19:34,656 --> 01:19:37,250
It was a farm boy named Kevin
who killed Goldie,

1023
01:19:37,326 --> 01:19:40,693
but it was Cardinal Roark
who was behind it, and I don't know why.

1024
01:19:40,763 --> 01:19:43,231
I know that sounds crazy.

1025
01:19:43,298 --> 01:19:46,631
No, it doesn't.
Goldie worked the clergy.

1026
01:19:46,702 --> 01:19:51,230
Just like that, a whopper of a puzzle piece
falls smack in my lap.

1027
01:19:51,306 --> 01:19:53,706
I'm too dumb to put
the whole picture together yet.

1028
01:19:53,776 --> 01:19:58,736
but she fires up two cigarettes and hands
me one and I taste her lipstick on it.

1029
01:19:58,814 --> 01:20:03,410
And suddenly, my heart's pounding
so loud I can't hear anything else.

1030
01:20:03,485 --> 01:20:08,047
I want to reach over and touch her
and taste Goldie's sweat one more time.

1031
01:20:08,123 --> 01:20:10,284
But she isn't Goldie.

1032
01:20:10,359 --> 01:20:12,418
Yeah, yeah.
This'll do.

1033
01:20:12,494 --> 01:20:17,932
I'm also gonna be needing a dozen
two-foot lengths of this rubber tubing...

1034
01:20:19,034 --> 01:20:21,400
and a spool of razor wire...

1035
01:20:22,538 --> 01:20:26,668
and a pair of those special gloves
that'll let me handle the wire.

1036
01:20:27,075 --> 01:20:29,737
(man) Beefing up
the old home security, huh?

1037
01:20:29,812 --> 01:20:31,336
(Marv) You can bet your ass.

1038
01:20:31,814 --> 01:20:35,716
(Wendy) She was my sister,
so I'm in this one to the end.

1039
01:20:35,784 --> 01:20:39,345
But why are you willing to go up against
Roark for someone you barely knew?

1040
01:20:39,421 --> 01:20:44,586
She was nice to me, gave me
something I didn't even know existed.

1041
01:20:44,660 --> 01:20:49,154
I wasn't never even able to buy a woman.

1042
01:20:49,231 --> 01:20:52,029
You know, the way I look.

1043
01:20:52,768 --> 01:20:56,636
I take my mind off her
and I crawl back inside myself.

1044
01:20:56,705 --> 01:20:59,674
It's almost killing time.
and I'd better get sharp.

1045
01:20:59,741 --> 01:21:04,041
I check the list -
rubber tubing, gas, saw,

1046
01:21:04,112 --> 01:21:08,139
gloves, cuffs, razor wire, hatchet.

1047
01:21:08,217 --> 01:21:10,481
Gladys and my mitts.

1048
01:21:10,552 --> 01:21:14,488
- We're close enough. Pull over.
- Yes, Marv.

1049
01:21:15,591 --> 01:21:17,149
Keep the engine runnin'.

1050
01:21:17,226 --> 01:21:21,993
If I'm not back in 20 minutes, you get
the hell outta here and don't Iook back.

1051
01:21:22,064 --> 01:21:23,998
Kill him for me, Marv.

1052
01:21:25,968 --> 01:21:28,163
Kill him good.

1053
01:21:28,237 --> 01:21:30,000
I won't let you down, Goldie.

1054
01:21:46,088 --> 01:21:48,113
Heading downstairs to the kitchen.

1055
01:21:48,190 --> 01:21:52,786
Getting himself a midnight snack.
and I can guess what kind.

1056
01:22:06,742 --> 01:22:09,370
Come on, you son of a bitch.

1057
01:22:09,945 --> 01:22:12,209
Damn, he's slick.

1058
01:22:13,649 --> 01:22:15,241
(yells)

1059
01:22:24,293 --> 01:22:26,727
Is that the best you can do, creep?

1060
01:22:28,697 --> 01:22:32,497
That's right.
Get personal, get close, I can take it.

1061
01:22:33,669 --> 01:22:38,072
I got you, you little bastard.
Let's see you hop around now.

1062
01:22:42,077 --> 01:22:46,707
I try to slow my heart down
and breathe the fire out of my lungs.

1063
01:22:46,782 --> 01:22:50,445
My muscles make me
a thousand promises of pain to come.

1064
01:22:50,519 --> 01:22:54,319
Let me do it, Marv.
She was my sister. Let me finish him.

1065
01:22:54,389 --> 01:22:56,949
You wasn't supposed
to come down here, Wendy.

1066
01:22:57,025 --> 01:22:59,789
Oh, but I want to...

1067
01:22:59,861 --> 01:23:03,991
I'm sorry. kid.
but I haven't even started with this creep.

1068
01:23:04,066 --> 01:23:08,298
and I don't want you watching the rest.
It'll give you nightmares.

1069
01:23:08,370 --> 01:23:11,396
God, I gotta tell you, I'm good and bushed.

1070
01:23:11,473 --> 01:23:14,670
And it's not that fight of ours
that did me in, either.

1071
01:23:14,743 --> 01:23:17,644
It's all that sawing and tying.

1072
01:23:17,713 --> 01:23:20,978
It's not as easy as it looks.

1073
01:23:21,049 --> 01:23:26,351
Could have been a real mess around here
if I didn't have that tubing for tourniquets.

1074
01:23:28,123 --> 01:23:32,958
I gotta admit,
there was a spurt or two,

1075
01:23:33,028 --> 01:23:38,330
to get the scent in the air,
to get that friend of yours to come running.

1076
01:23:41,870 --> 01:23:43,701
Well, what do you know?

1077
01:23:44,539 --> 01:23:47,133
Lookwho's here.

1078
01:23:47,209 --> 01:23:48,699
Here he comes.

1079
01:23:50,846 --> 01:23:54,407
(dog growling)

1080
01:23:55,484 --> 01:23:58,146
That's a good dog.

1081
01:23:58,220 --> 01:24:02,316
He doesn't scream,
not even when the mutt's had its fill

1082
01:24:02,391 --> 01:24:04,985
and Kevin's guts
are lying all over the place.

1083
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:08,928
Somehow the bastard is still alive,
still staring at me.

1084
01:24:08,997 --> 01:24:13,161
Not even when I grab the saw
and finish the job.

1085
01:24:13,602 --> 01:24:16,070
He never screams.

1086
01:24:18,974 --> 01:24:22,171
I put in a call to Kadie's
and ask Nancy to get her clothes on

1087
01:24:22,244 --> 01:24:25,680
and meet me at her place.
She says "Yes" like always.

1088
01:24:25,747 --> 01:24:28,511
Hey, Nancy, you got any beers?

1089
01:24:28,583 --> 01:24:31,552
Sure, Marv.
Who's the babe?

1090
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:34,521
There isn't much of anything
Nancy wouldn't do for me.

1091
01:24:34,589 --> 01:24:37,319
Not since a year back
when a frat boy roughed her up

1092
01:24:37,392 --> 01:24:39,724
and I straightened him out but good.

1093
01:24:39,795 --> 01:24:43,492
It really gets my goat
when guys rough up dames.

1094
01:24:43,565 --> 01:24:45,328
So, what do you want me to do with her?

1095
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:50,030
Well, your best bet is
drive her all the way up to Sacred Oaks.

1096
01:24:50,105 --> 01:24:53,199
What about you?
Are you leaving town?

1097
01:24:53,275 --> 01:24:56,039
Hell, no.
I like it here.

1098
01:24:57,612 --> 01:24:58,943
(belches)

1099
01:24:59,014 --> 01:25:01,847
I hot-wire a parked cab
and stay under the speed limit

1100
01:25:01,917 --> 01:25:04,215
so as not to get any attention.

1101
01:25:04,653 --> 01:25:08,521
My head starts to clear.
Things start to make sense.

1102
01:25:08,590 --> 01:25:10,490
I owe you. Goldie.

1103
01:25:10,559 --> 01:25:12,959
I owe you one and I'm gonna pay up.

1104
01:25:13,028 --> 01:25:16,020
So, if going after Roark
means dying, win or lose -

1105
01:25:16,098 --> 01:25:20,592
hell, I'll die laughing
if I know I've done this one thing right.

1106
01:25:25,273 --> 01:25:27,833
Quiet as a grave out here.
No sign of target.

1107
01:25:27,909 --> 01:25:30,639
(man on radio)
All right, keep a lookout.

1108
01:25:46,528 --> 01:25:49,827
- Kevin?
- What's left of him, anyways.

1109
01:25:51,533 --> 01:25:53,125
The dog ate the rest.

1110
01:26:00,842 --> 01:26:05,074
Oh, my God.
You monster.

1111
01:26:05,147 --> 01:26:07,945
You demon.

1112
01:26:08,350 --> 01:26:10,477
Don't scream or I'll plug you.

1113
01:26:11,219 --> 01:26:16,714
He had the voice of an angel,
yet he spoke only to me.

1114
01:26:17,125 --> 01:26:20,686
And he's dead now
because of one stupid whore.

1115
01:26:21,296 --> 01:26:26,393
It's not a real good idea for you to talk
about Goldie that way while I'm around.

1116
01:26:26,468 --> 01:26:28,732
When he came to me...

1117
01:26:30,205 --> 01:26:32,537
he was a tormented boy.

1118
01:26:34,376 --> 01:26:37,106
Tormented by guilt.

1119
01:26:38,013 --> 01:26:40,413
I tried to counsel him.

1120
01:26:41,950 --> 01:26:46,410
But the eating - it filled him with white light.

1121
01:26:46,755 --> 01:26:51,556
Tearful, he swore to me
that he felt the touch of God Almighty.

1122
01:26:52,394 --> 01:26:54,555
What the hell do you know?

1123
01:26:54,629 --> 01:26:57,097
I know it's pretty damn weird to eat people.

1124
01:26:57,165 --> 01:27:00,100
He didn't just eat their bodies,

1125
01:27:00,502 --> 01:27:02,732
he ate their souls.

1126
01:27:04,339 --> 01:27:06,739
And  I joined  in.

1127
01:27:09,978 --> 01:27:12,173
They were all whores.

1128
01:27:13,348 --> 01:27:17,114
Nobody cared for them.
Nobody missed them.

1129
01:27:17,586 --> 01:27:22,614
And then your Goldie
almost ruined everything.

1130
01:27:22,691 --> 01:27:24,989
She stayed in public places.

1131
01:27:25,060 --> 01:27:27,392
And then with you.

1132
01:27:27,462 --> 01:27:28,895
You were so convenient.

1133
01:27:29,331 --> 01:27:32,232
You'd broke a man's jaw that very night.

1134
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:34,860
Who would believe a thug like you?

1135
01:27:34,936 --> 01:27:36,528
Kevin killed her.

1136
01:27:36,605 --> 01:27:40,336
I ordered the police in for you,
but you wouldn't be caught.

1137
01:27:40,408 --> 01:27:41,875
You wouldn't stop.

1138
01:27:41,943 --> 01:27:44,878
And now he's dead and you're here to...

1139
01:27:46,481 --> 01:27:48,381
eliminate me.

1140
01:27:49,117 --> 01:27:52,644
Will that give you satisfaction, my son?

1141
01:27:54,389 --> 01:27:59,383
Killing a helpless old fart?

1142
01:28:00,362 --> 01:28:02,296
The killing, no.

1143
01:28:02,364 --> 01:28:05,162
No satisfaction.

1144
01:28:06,034 --> 01:28:09,834
Everything up until the killing will be a gas.

1145
01:28:13,208 --> 01:28:14,971
Kevin...

1146
01:28:17,445 --> 01:28:19,606
we're going home.

1147
01:28:22,817 --> 01:28:25,809
You can scream now if you want to.

1148
01:28:33,328 --> 01:28:38,129
It's beautiful Goldie.
It's just like I promised, only better.

1149
01:28:38,199 --> 01:28:39,723
And when his eyes go dead,

1150
01:28:39,801 --> 01:28:44,033
the hell I sent him to must seem like
heaven after what I've done to him.

1151
01:28:45,073 --> 01:28:47,098
- (man) Freeze!
- (man #2) Oh, my God!

1152
01:28:53,114 --> 01:28:54,547
(beeping)

1153
01:28:54,616 --> 01:28:56,481
(sighs) Jerks.

1154
01:28:56,551 --> 01:29:00,351
They should've shot me in the head.
and enough times to make sure.

1155
01:29:00,422 --> 01:29:02,287
It's so stupid.

1156
01:29:02,357 --> 01:29:06,316
Everybody knows what's coming,
but they go through the motions anyway.

1157
01:29:06,394 --> 01:29:08,555
What a waste of time.

1158
01:29:09,197 --> 01:29:13,099
Months fall off the calendar
while I breathe and eat through tubes.

1159
01:29:13,168 --> 01:29:17,070
Night after night, I wait for somebody
to come and finish me off.

1160
01:29:17,138 --> 01:29:20,972
After a while
I realize it's not gonna be so easy as that.

1161
01:29:21,943 --> 01:29:23,604
I'm on my feet for about ten minutes

1162
01:29:23,678 --> 01:29:26,613
before the cops kick them out
from under me.

1163
01:29:26,681 --> 01:29:28,706
They don't ask me any questions.

1164
01:29:28,783 --> 01:29:33,243
They just keep knocking the crap out of
me and waving a confession in my face.

1165
01:29:33,321 --> 01:29:35,346
And I keep spitting blood all over it

1166
01:29:35,423 --> 01:29:38,984
and laughing at how many fresh copies
they come up with.

1167
01:29:39,060 --> 01:29:43,554
Then along comes this worm assistant
district attorney who turns the recorder off

1168
01:29:43,631 --> 01:29:48,068
and says if I don't sign their confession
they'll kill my mom.

1169
01:29:48,136 --> 01:29:51,594
I break his arm in three places
and I sign it.

1170
01:29:51,673 --> 01:29:54,767
From then on,
it's the circus everybody wants it to be.

1171
01:29:55,443 --> 01:29:59,243
They nail me for the works -
not just the people I did kill.

1172
01:29:59,314 --> 01:30:03,614
but even Lucille and the girls
that Roark and Kevin ate.

1173
01:30:03,685 --> 01:30:06,085
and even Goldie.

1174
01:30:06,755 --> 01:30:11,351
The judge is all fire and brimstone
when she hands down the sentence.

1175
01:30:12,394 --> 01:30:15,386
Midnight and my death
are only a few hours away.

1176
01:30:15,463 --> 01:30:18,626
when I get my first surprise in 18 months.

1177
01:30:20,235 --> 01:30:22,635
My only visitor.

1178
01:30:22,704 --> 01:30:25,696
I'm ready for anything but that scent.

1179
01:30:25,774 --> 01:30:28,902
I got 'em for you good,
didn't I, Goldie?

1180
01:30:34,048 --> 01:30:36,676
Oh, I'm sorry, Wendy.

1181
01:30:36,751 --> 01:30:39,982
I... I got confused again.

1182
01:30:40,054 --> 01:30:42,682
Just seeing you like this.

1183
01:30:44,993 --> 01:30:47,587
You can call me Goldie.

1184
01:30:56,671 --> 01:30:59,697
She smells like angels ought to smell.

1185
01:30:59,774 --> 01:31:02,470
The perfect woman.

1186
01:31:02,544 --> 01:31:04,341
The goddess.

1187
01:31:05,647 --> 01:31:07,842
Goldie.

1188
01:31:07,916 --> 01:31:10,510
She says her name is Goldie.

1189
01:31:13,188 --> 01:31:16,680
They fix me a pretty decent steak
for my last meal.

1190
01:31:16,758 --> 01:31:21,286
They even throw in a brew.
It's the first I've had since back at Nancy's.

1191
01:31:21,362 --> 01:31:26,026
Then they shave my head and fix me
with a rubber diaper and get to it.

1192
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:28,967
And it's about damned time.
if you ask me.

1193
01:31:29,037 --> 01:31:31,597
"Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death..."

1194
01:31:31,673 --> 01:31:34,403
Would you get a move on?
I haven't got all night.

1195
01:31:34,476 --> 01:31:37,172
You heard the man.
Hit it.

1196
01:31:37,846 --> 01:31:40,041
(buzzing)

1197
01:31:46,488 --> 01:31:49,480
Is that the best you can do, you pansies?

1198
01:32:02,704 --> 01:32:03,830
He's gone.

1199
01:37:05,732 --> 01:37:07,063
Forget it, man.

1200
01:37:07,134 --> 01:37:09,568
You can bang on that door
all night if you want to.

1201
01:37:09,636 --> 01:37:12,196
There is no way in hell
I'm letting you in.

1202
01:37:12,272 --> 01:37:15,708
I can't believe
you're doing this to me, Shellie.

1203
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:19,872
Everything we've shared -
it has to mean something to you.

1204
01:37:19,947 --> 01:37:21,847
Ha. It meant plenty.

1205
01:37:21,915 --> 01:37:25,282
Plenty of lost pay on account of how
nobody wants to fllrt wlth a waltress

1206
01:37:25,352 --> 01:37:27,980
whose face is all purple
and swollen up with bruises.

1207
01:37:28,055 --> 01:37:29,647
I know you're angry, baby.

1208
01:37:29,723 --> 01:37:32,886
And I forgive you for that
without you even asking me to.

1209
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:34,689
There's a difference
between getting honked off

1210
01:37:34,761 --> 01:37:36,490
at a guy who's generally not so bad,

1211
01:37:36,563 --> 01:37:40,727
and flndlng out that you've been
sweet-talked by a total jerk loser

1212
01:37:40,801 --> 01:37:43,361
who skips out on a wife
that he doesn't even tell you about

1213
01:37:43,437 --> 01:37:46,201
every time he gets drunk,
which is way too often!

1214
01:37:46,273 --> 01:37:49,174
Especially the kind of total jerk loser

1215
01:37:49,243 --> 01:37:52,212
who has to beat up on a girl
to make himself feel like a man.

1216
01:37:52,279 --> 01:37:54,679
That hurt, Shellie.

1217
01:37:54,748 --> 01:38:00,380
It's one thing for you to play hard to get,
but don't go trying to cut my nuts off.

1218
01:38:00,454 --> 01:38:02,979
I am impossible to get.

1219
01:38:03,056 --> 01:38:09,552
Do yourself a favor, Jackie Boy,
and get help, like a shrink.

1220
01:38:09,630 --> 01:38:12,463
Get help and get lost.

1221
01:38:12,532 --> 01:38:14,227
Just open the door.

1222
01:38:14,301 --> 01:38:19,170
Go ahead and open the door, Shellie.
I'll take care of this.

1223
01:38:19,239 --> 01:38:23,335
Just open the door and you'll see
how wrong you've been about me.

1224
01:38:24,978 --> 01:38:28,345
Oblige him, Shellie.
I'm ready for him.

1225
01:38:28,415 --> 01:38:32,078
No! If he knew that you were here with me,
you don't know how bad this could get!

1226
01:38:32,152 --> 01:38:35,644
This clown's got a big, mean drunk on.

1227
01:38:35,722 --> 01:38:37,849
And he's got four friends
out there in the hall,

1228
01:38:37,925 --> 01:38:40,553
breathing hard
and just as drunk as he is.

1229
01:38:40,627 --> 01:38:45,621
Hey, I could swear I heard somebody
in there with you just now.

1230
01:38:45,699 --> 01:38:51,262
Somebody! Jackie Boy,
it's a regular African love fest in here!

1231
01:38:52,472 --> 01:38:54,906
- I'm no racist.
- I mean, I got me all five starters,

1232
01:38:54,975 --> 01:38:58,103
and half the bench of
the Basin City Blues keeping me company.

1233
01:38:58,178 --> 01:39:00,305
You feel like taking them on?

1234
01:39:00,380 --> 01:39:03,440
You are teasing me, baby.

1235
01:39:03,517 --> 01:39:07,078
Some of my best friends...

1236
01:39:07,187 --> 01:39:09,815
But you're really pushing my buttons.

1237
01:39:09,890 --> 01:39:12,120
And the whole time
you've been doing me like this,

1238
01:39:12,192 --> 01:39:15,025
I've been too polite to point out
that at any time I want to,

1239
01:39:15,095 --> 01:39:18,292
I could kick this damn door to splinters.

1240
01:39:18,365 --> 01:39:21,266
OK, baby, you know what I can do.

1241
01:39:21,335 --> 01:39:23,633
- You know what I can do. One, two...
- All right, then!

1242
01:39:23,704 --> 01:39:26,730
All  right
All   right, all  Right!

1243
01:39:29,443 --> 01:39:32,879
Troops, make yourself at home.

1244
01:39:41,588 --> 01:39:44,614
You brought your whole pack with you?

1245
01:39:44,691 --> 01:39:47,524
None of these bozos got lives,
they gotta hang out with you?

1246
01:39:47,594 --> 01:39:49,255
You're gonna love this, baby.

1247
01:39:49,329 --> 01:39:52,162
You're gonna call up some of your friends
who work the saloon.

1248
01:39:52,232 --> 01:39:55,724
With you and the bunch of us,
we're gonna hit every joint in town,

1249
01:39:55,802 --> 01:39:57,599
and it's gonna be great.

1250
01:39:57,671 --> 01:39:59,798
I ain't calling up nobody.

1251
01:40:04,311 --> 01:40:09,146
That's a man's shirt,
and I'm sure as hell it ain't one of mine.

1252
01:40:09,216 --> 01:40:13,585
You got somebody's love stink all over you.

1253
01:40:13,653 --> 01:40:17,020
You've been with another man
and you've been with him tonight.

1254
01:40:17,090 --> 01:40:20,526
- Who is he?
- He's Superman.

1255
01:40:20,594 --> 01:40:24,655
He flew out the window
just as soon as he heard you were coming,

1256
01:40:24,731 --> 01:40:27,165
'cause you scared him so bad.

1257
01:40:27,234 --> 01:40:29,293
(laughs)

1258
01:40:29,369 --> 01:40:33,396
(Jackie Boy) You think
I have no feelings at all.

1259
01:40:33,473 --> 01:40:35,600
(Shellie) If you're gonna slug me,

1260
01:40:35,675 --> 01:40:38,701
just go ahead and get it over with,
you sick bastard.

1261
01:40:38,779 --> 01:40:42,909
(Jackie Boy) There you go,
lying about me again,

1262
01:40:42,983 --> 01:40:45,645
right in front of my friends.

1263
01:40:45,719 --> 01:40:49,018
I have never hit a woman in my life.

1264
01:40:52,225 --> 01:40:54,022
(laughter)

1265
01:40:54,661 --> 01:40:56,856
That's showing her, man.

1266
01:40:56,930 --> 01:41:01,458
You goddamn bastard.
You goddamn coward.

1267
01:41:01,535 --> 01:41:04,470
- Baby, we're all here to have a good time.
- Yeah.

1268
01:41:04,538 --> 01:41:08,338
- I gotta take a leak.
- Oh!

1269
01:41:08,408 --> 01:41:10,876
Wish you'd dropped by earlier, Jackie Boy.

1270
01:41:11,278 --> 01:41:14,577
Then you could've met my boyfriend.

1271
01:41:14,648 --> 01:41:17,139
Could've seen what a real man looks like.

1272
01:41:17,217 --> 01:41:21,051
There you go, after my nuts again.

1273
01:41:21,121 --> 01:41:23,419
But I forgive you.

1274
01:41:23,490 --> 01:41:25,481
I'm a generous guy.

1275
01:41:25,559 --> 01:41:30,019
He is generous.
But that temper of his...

1276
01:41:30,097 --> 01:41:33,225
You never should have
picked on him like you did.

1277
01:41:33,867 --> 01:41:36,768
My temper you don't have to worry about.

1278
01:41:37,237 --> 01:41:40,900
Shut up and keep your hands to yourself
or I'll cut your little pecker off.

1279
01:41:40,974 --> 01:41:43,704
Ooh.
I've been told.

1280
01:41:45,045 --> 01:41:48,139
You don't wanna be hittin' the streets
dressed like that, honey.

1281
01:41:48,215 --> 01:41:49,876
It's a jungle out there.

1282
01:41:49,950 --> 01:41:52,942
Besides, you got a couple
of phone calls you ought to be makin'.

1283
01:41:57,190 --> 01:42:01,957
Hey, baby,
I don't hear you making those calls.

1284
01:42:02,028 --> 01:42:04,792
Answer me!

1285
01:42:04,865 --> 01:42:06,958
Oh, I don't need this grief.

1286
01:42:07,033 --> 01:42:12,903
Hi. I'm Shellie's new boyfriend
and I'm out of my mind.

1287
01:42:12,973 --> 01:42:17,842
You ever so much as talk to Shellie again,
you even think her name,

1288
01:42:17,911 --> 01:42:21,574
and I'll cut you in ways
that'll make you useless to a woman.

1289
01:42:21,648 --> 01:42:26,108
You're making a big mistake, man.
A big mistake.

1290
01:42:26,186 --> 01:42:31,522
Yeah?
You already made a big mistake yourself.

1291
01:42:31,591 --> 01:42:34,025
You didn't flush.

1292
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:29,071
Troops, get outta here.

1293
01:43:29,149 --> 01:43:31,276
No questions, damn it.
No questions.

1294
01:43:31,351 --> 01:43:33,182
Now!

1295
01:43:47,867 --> 01:43:50,267
(helicopter overhead)

1296
01:43:50,337 --> 01:43:51,861
(sirens blaring)

1297
01:43:51,938 --> 01:43:54,133
Dwight, what in the devil
did you do to him?

1298
01:43:54,207 --> 01:43:57,176
I just gave him a taste of his own medicine.

1299
01:43:57,244 --> 01:43:59,439
l don't think he'll be bothering you again.

1300
01:43:59,846 --> 01:44:03,407
- How's your jaw?
- I've been slapped around worse.

1301
01:44:03,483 --> 01:44:07,476
Dwight, he was from a while back,

1302
01:44:07,554 --> 01:44:10,853
before you showed up again
with that new face of yours.

1303
01:44:10,924 --> 01:44:14,690
And it was only 'cause I felt sorry for him.

1304
01:44:14,761 --> 01:44:17,195
And it was only once.

1305
01:44:17,264 --> 01:44:19,255
I've done some dumb things.

1306
01:44:19,332 --> 01:44:21,323
Seeing as how
I'm one of those dumb things,

1307
01:44:21,401 --> 01:44:24,097
I can't give you
too hard a time about that, Shellie.

1308
01:44:24,170 --> 01:44:28,436
But this guy, he's a menace.

1309
01:44:28,508 --> 01:44:31,341
He might kill somebody if I don't stop him.

1310
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:34,975
I'll call you later.

1311
01:44:35,048 --> 01:44:36,538
No, don't go!

1312
01:44:36,616 --> 01:44:38,914
Shellie shouts something
I can't quite make out

1313
01:44:38,985 --> 01:44:41,681
over the racket of a passing police 'copter.

1314
01:44:41,755 --> 01:44:45,418
- Stop!
- It sounds like "stop" but I can't be sure.

1315
01:44:46,092 --> 01:44:49,687
It's a chance I shouldn't be taking.
but I can't just go home and forget about it.

1316
01:44:49,763 --> 01:44:53,130
and let Jackie Boy and his pals
find their fun.

1317
01:44:53,199 --> 01:44:58,865
They're a pack of predators and they're
out for blood tonight - a woman's blood.

1318
01:44:58,938 --> 01:45:02,237
Damn it, Dwight.
Damn it.

1319
01:45:02,309 --> 01:45:05,244
You fool.

1320
01:45:05,312 --> 01:45:07,576
You damned fool.

1321
01:45:07,647 --> 01:45:09,410
I cut my Caddy across the park

1322
01:45:09,482 --> 01:45:13,043
to pick up Jackie Boy heading
like a bat outta hell up the hill.

1323
01:45:13,119 --> 01:45:15,110
I'm speeding.

1324
01:45:15,188 --> 01:45:19,989
That's a good way to get yourself noticed.
And if you're a murderer with a new face

1325
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:24,429
who's one fingerprint check away from
the fast track to the gas chamber like I am.

1326
01:45:24,497 --> 01:45:27,625
the last thing you want
is to get noticed.

1327
01:45:27,701 --> 01:45:28,895
(siren blaring)

1328
01:45:28,968 --> 01:45:33,428
I don't have nearly enough cash on me
to bribe this cop, and even if I did.

1329
01:45:33,506 --> 01:45:36,669
there's always the outside chance
he's one of the honest ones.

1330
01:45:36,743 --> 01:45:42,375
Do I try to talk my way out of this
or do I take this cop down and risk it all?

1331
01:45:42,982 --> 01:45:46,748
Then Jackie Boy saves me
a great, big steaming pile of trouble.

1332
01:45:46,820 --> 01:45:49,414
Watch it, Jack!

1333
01:45:49,489 --> 01:45:51,514
(horns blaring)

1334
01:45:55,462 --> 01:45:57,225
Cops!
They're right on our ass!

1335
01:45:57,297 --> 01:46:00,789
Not for long.
Not where we're headed.

1336
01:46:00,867 --> 01:46:03,927
My gut tightens up.

1337
01:46:04,003 --> 01:46:08,372
Jackie Boy's leading us
straight to Old Town.

1338
01:46:10,910 --> 01:46:12,775
The cop shuts off his siren.

1339
01:46:12,846 --> 01:46:16,111
He knows he's not the law,
not in Old Town.

1340
01:46:16,182 --> 01:46:20,448
The ladies are the law here,
beautiful and merciless.

1341
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:22,488
If you've got the cash
and you play by the rules.

1342
01:46:22,555 --> 01:46:24,955
they'll make all your dreams come true.

1343
01:46:25,024 --> 01:46:28,755
But if you cross 'em. you're a corpse.

1344
01:46:28,828 --> 01:46:33,595
- The squad car's long gone, man.
- Yeah, I called it. Was I right?

1345
01:46:33,666 --> 01:46:38,228
You're always right, Jack.
None of us ever doubted you for a second.

1346
01:46:39,239 --> 01:46:44,677
But I heard things about these girls. Things
they've done to guys who got out of line.

1347
01:46:44,744 --> 01:46:47,235
Who's outta line?

1348
01:46:53,586 --> 01:46:56,054
Hey, baby. Hey, baby.

1349
01:46:58,958 --> 01:47:01,119
Hop in, sugar.
We'll get you there.

1350
01:47:01,528 --> 01:47:06,022
Aw, sweetheart, I work the day shift
and it's been a long day.

1351
01:47:06,099 --> 01:47:09,125
Besides, I don't do group jobs.

1352
01:47:09,803 --> 01:47:13,239
Get in the car, baby.
We'll just talk. It'll be nice.

1353
01:47:13,306 --> 01:47:15,399
I don't do talk jobs, either.

1354
01:47:15,475 --> 01:47:20,538
Babydoll,
I've had me one hell of a bad day.

1355
01:47:20,613 --> 01:47:24,310
I've been beat up every time I turn around.

1356
01:47:24,384 --> 01:47:26,511
But the day I get turned down by a hooker

1357
01:47:26,586 --> 01:47:30,181
when I got good,
hard-earned cash to pay her with...

1358
01:47:30,256 --> 01:47:32,656
well...

1359
01:47:32,725 --> 01:47:35,216
there's only so much a man can take.

1360
01:47:35,295 --> 01:47:37,456
Go try the Alamo over on Dillon Street.

1361
01:47:37,530 --> 01:47:39,896
That's the Alamo, not the Amigo.

1362
01:47:39,966 --> 01:47:42,594
The Amigo's a fag joint.

1363
01:47:43,136 --> 01:47:49,075
Are you having a good time humiliating me
like this for no damn reason at all?

1364
01:47:51,344 --> 01:47:54,643
That's far enough, Dwight.
We've been on top of these peckerwoods

1365
01:47:54,714 --> 01:47:57,274
since they first showed up
with that cop behind them.

1366
01:47:57,350 --> 01:47:59,375
Everything's under control.

1367
01:48:00,487 --> 01:48:02,614
Enjoy the show.

1368
01:48:02,689 --> 01:48:05,624
There's no use arguing with her.

1369
01:48:05,692 --> 01:48:08,559
The ladies are their own enforcers.

1370
01:48:08,628 --> 01:48:11,654
So, how's the barmaid?
You know, the one that never shuts up?

1371
01:48:11,731 --> 01:48:14,894
- Not right now, Gail.
- Ooh.

1372
01:48:14,968 --> 01:48:17,027
Wound up a little tight, aren't we?

1373
01:48:17,103 --> 01:48:20,903
That's your whole problem, Dwight.
You worry too much.

1374
01:48:20,974 --> 01:48:24,000
That, and your lousy taste in women.
These days, anyway.

1375
01:48:24,077 --> 01:48:27,103
Damn it, Gail.
Not right now.

1376
01:48:27,180 --> 01:48:31,082
Those clowns down the way -
they some of the barmaid's boyfriends?

1377
01:48:31,150 --> 01:48:33,243
One of them thinks he is.

1378
01:48:33,319 --> 01:48:35,344
He's outta control.

1379
01:48:35,421 --> 01:48:38,857
I followed them here to make sure
he didn't hurt any of the girls.

1380
01:48:38,925 --> 01:48:42,554
Us helpless little girls.

1381
01:48:43,162 --> 01:48:47,223
All kinds of death is about to hit
less than 20 yards ahead of us.

1382
01:48:47,300 --> 01:48:50,861
and still it's hard to take my eyes off her.

1383
01:48:50,937 --> 01:48:53,667
Us girls are safe as we can be, Lancelot.

1384
01:48:53,740 --> 01:48:56,208
Those boys in that Chrysler
are one mistake away

1385
01:48:56,276 --> 01:48:58,744
from seeing what Miho can do.

1386
01:48:58,811 --> 01:49:02,804
And   she's  been  aching for some  practice.

1387
01:49:03,816 --> 01:49:08,549
She guides my glance upwards
to the pixie perched on the roof's edge.

1388
01:49:08,621 --> 01:49:12,853
- Deadly little Miho.
- (girl) You're running out of alley, cowboy.

1389
01:49:13,426 --> 01:49:17,192
Turn around. Save yourself
and your buddies a ton of grief.

1390
01:49:17,263 --> 01:49:19,959
(Jackie Boy) You're a sassy little thing.

1391
01:49:20,033 --> 01:49:24,834
You ain't hardly in any kind
of position to be making threats.

1392
01:49:24,904 --> 01:49:28,965
The trap is set.
locked and ready to spring.

1393
01:49:29,042 --> 01:49:32,944
So what? They're scum.
They deserve what's coming.

1394
01:49:33,012 --> 01:49:36,379
So why this rotten feeling in my gut
that something is awfully wrong?

1395
01:49:36,449 --> 01:49:39,680
They haven't killed anybody I know about.

1396
01:49:39,752 --> 01:49:44,451
It got pretty bad at Shellie's place,
but they didn't kill anybody.

1397
01:49:44,524 --> 01:49:45,957
And they won't.

1398
01:49:46,025 --> 01:49:48,152
Why this rotten feeling?

1399
01:49:48,227 --> 01:49:51,719
Something Shellie said.
I can't place it.

1400
01:49:51,798 --> 01:49:56,030
OK, OK, OK. I sounded off
a little more than I should have.

1401
01:49:56,102 --> 01:49:59,094
- I'm a little on edge.
- Over the edge.

1402
01:49:59,172 --> 01:50:02,403
It's not a woman you need.
It's a good night's sleep.

1403
01:50:02,475 --> 01:50:06,309
You couldn't handle a woman,
the state you're in.

1404
01:50:06,379 --> 01:50:08,813
She's saying you ain't got
what it takes, Jack.

1405
01:50:11,551 --> 01:50:13,212
You wanna see it?

1406
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:17,778
You wanna see what I got? Huh?

1407
01:50:17,857 --> 01:50:21,918
I've seen all shapes, all sizes.

1408
01:50:22,996 --> 01:50:25,464
You seen this one?

1409
01:50:27,433 --> 01:50:29,094
Get in the car.

1410
01:50:29,168 --> 01:50:33,798
Oh, sugar, you just gone and done
the dumbest thing in your whole life.

1411
01:50:51,024 --> 01:50:52,286
Oh, God, no!

1412
01:50:54,394 --> 01:50:56,021
This is crazy!

1413
01:50:56,796 --> 01:50:59,458
Out of nowhere, for no reason at all!

1414
01:51:07,206 --> 01:51:08,264
Go ahead.

1415
01:51:08,341 --> 01:51:11,606
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

1416
01:51:11,678 --> 01:51:14,112
- He's got the drop on her.
- He's got squat.

1417
01:51:14,180 --> 01:51:18,014
He's dead.
He's just too damn dumb to know it.

1418
01:51:20,820 --> 01:51:24,654
I got you right where I want you.

1419
01:51:24,724 --> 01:51:27,921
This is a career-ending wound, whore.

1420
01:51:27,994 --> 01:51:31,486
- And there's gonna be hell to pay.
- Watch your step, Jackie Boy.

1421
01:51:34,667 --> 01:51:35,964
Yeesh.

1422
01:51:43,676 --> 01:51:45,667
This isn't funny.

1423
01:51:46,412 --> 01:51:50,007
Don't anyone laugh.
I got friends you can't imagine.

1424
01:51:50,083 --> 01:51:52,313
Every one of you is gonna burn.

1425
01:51:54,087 --> 01:51:56,317
(Dwight) Hang it up.
She's just playing with you.

1426
01:51:56,389 --> 01:51:59,688
- You're only making it worse.
- You shut the hell up.

1427
01:52:00,526 --> 01:52:04,121
Don't pull the trigger.
She blocked the barrel. It'll backfire.

1428
01:52:04,197 --> 01:52:07,997
I told you to shut up.

1429
01:52:13,005 --> 01:52:15,235
I can't see.

1430
01:52:15,308 --> 01:52:17,333
What's happening?

1431
01:52:18,911 --> 01:52:21,311
I can't see.

1432
01:52:21,380 --> 01:52:24,110
I can't hear anything.

1433
01:52:24,183 --> 01:52:27,641
For God's sake, Miho, finish him.

1434
01:52:27,720 --> 01:52:31,281
Yeah.
Make it quick, will you?

1435
01:52:33,259 --> 01:52:36,228
She doesn't quite chop his head off.

1436
01:52:38,931 --> 01:52:42,230
She makes a Pez dispenser out of him.

1437
01:52:44,137 --> 01:52:47,732
Then it's straight to business - stretching
the corpses out on the alley floor

1438
01:52:47,807 --> 01:52:52,073
and going through their pockets.
divvying up cash when they find it.

1439
01:52:52,145 --> 01:52:54,204
I'm fishing around in Jackie Boy's pants.

1440
01:52:54,280 --> 01:52:56,111
His wallet is packed.

1441
01:52:56,182 --> 01:53:00,141
Mastercard. Discover.
Platinum American Express.

1442
01:53:00,219 --> 01:53:02,483
and nearly 300 bucks worth of twenties

1443
01:53:02,555 --> 01:53:06,491
that I'm not too proud
to stuff into my own pockets.

1444
01:53:06,559 --> 01:53:08,424
Then I find an atom bomb.

1445
01:53:10,863 --> 01:53:13,161
Jackie Boy.

1446
01:53:13,232 --> 01:53:15,666
you son of a bitch.

1447
01:53:20,673 --> 01:53:22,766
There was a helicopter
that kicked up such a racket.

1448
01:53:22,842 --> 01:53:26,005
- I couldn't quite make out what she said.
- (mouthing)

1449
01:53:26,078 --> 01:53:28,512
I thought Shellie said "stop"

1450
01:53:28,581 --> 01:53:31,209
She said "cop"

1451
01:53:31,284 --> 01:53:34,481
Detective Lieutenant Jack Rafferty.

1452
01:53:34,554 --> 01:53:37,887
Iron Jack. the papers call him.

1453
01:53:37,957 --> 01:53:40,721
A goddamn hero cop.

1454
01:53:43,162 --> 01:53:46,029
It's held for years, the shaky truce.

1455
01:53:46,098 --> 01:53:50,125
The cops get a slice of the profits and free
entertainment when they throw a party.

1456
01:53:50,203 --> 01:53:53,001
The girls get to administer
their own brand of justice.

1457
01:53:53,539 --> 01:53:58,067
They get to defend their own turf.
If a cop blunders into the neighborhood

1458
01:53:58,144 --> 01:54:02,547
and he's not shopping for what the girls
are selling, they send him packing,

1459
01:54:02,615 --> 01:54:05,277
but they send him back alive.

1460
01:54:05,351 --> 01:54:07,478
That's the rules.

1461
01:54:07,553 --> 01:54:09,453
That's the truce.

1462
01:54:09,522 --> 01:54:12,116
The cops stay out.

1463
01:54:12,191 --> 01:54:15,319
That keeps the girls free
to keep the pimps and the mob out.

1464
01:54:15,394 --> 01:54:18,386
Old Town will be left wide open.

1465
01:54:18,464 --> 01:54:20,364
It'll be war.

1466
01:54:20,433 --> 01:54:23,960
The streets will run red with blood -

1467
01:54:24,036 --> 01:54:26,334
women's blood.

1468
01:54:26,405 --> 01:54:28,839
The cops!
The mob!

1469
01:54:28,908 --> 01:54:31,604
Things are gonna go back
to the way they used to be!

1470
01:54:31,677 --> 01:54:35,545
The hell they will!
We got guns.

1471
01:54:35,615 --> 01:54:37,708
We'll fight the cops and the mob

1472
01:54:37,783 --> 01:54:41,219
and anybody else
who tries to move in on us.

1473
01:54:41,287 --> 01:54:42,914
- We'll go to war.
- Don't be stupid.

1474
01:54:42,989 --> 01:54:46,288
You wouldn't stand a chance.
Get me a car.

1475
01:54:46,359 --> 01:54:49,522
Make sure it's a hardtop
with a decent engine.

1476
01:54:49,595 --> 01:54:50,994
I'll hide the bodies.

1477
01:54:51,063 --> 01:54:54,555
Did you forget that cop car
that trailed them here?

1478
01:54:54,634 --> 01:54:57,159
The cops know Rafferty came here.

1479
01:54:57,236 --> 01:55:00,262
They'll check the river,
they'll check the sewer.

1480
01:55:00,339 --> 01:55:02,239
They'll find him
and come gunning for us.

1481
01:55:02,308 --> 01:55:05,209
I'll haul the bodies to the pits.
The cops won't check the pits.

1482
01:55:05,278 --> 01:55:07,178
Get that gun out of my face or I'll smack ya.

1483
01:55:07,246 --> 01:55:11,444
Who do you think you are, giving orders?

1484
01:55:11,517 --> 01:55:14,179
- You got what you wanted out of us.
- Shut up, Gail.

1485
01:55:14,253 --> 01:55:16,983
You got what you wanted out of me!

1486
01:55:17,056 --> 01:55:20,685
And you were gone,
off playing with that barmaid.

1487
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:24,992
Gone until you brought
this unholy mess on us.

1488
01:55:25,064 --> 01:55:27,794
Miho moves to my back.

1489
01:55:29,402 --> 01:55:31,962
One word from Gail
and she'll cut me in half.

1490
01:55:32,038 --> 01:55:35,701
They'll be watching the roads.
They'll catch you.

1491
01:55:35,775 --> 01:55:39,006
It'll be the bad old days all over again.

1492
01:55:39,078 --> 01:55:41,808
The pimps, the beatings,
the drugs, the rapes!

1493
01:55:41,881 --> 01:55:45,840
They won't be watching the roads. Not yet,
they won't! Get me a damn hardtop!

1494
01:55:45,918 --> 01:55:48,182
If I don't make it, you can have your war.

1495
01:55:48,254 --> 01:55:50,848
Get that gun out of my face now!

1496
01:55:50,923 --> 01:55:52,117
(yells)

1497
01:55:53,492 --> 01:55:55,289
Bastard!

1498
01:55:59,999 --> 01:56:02,229
I forgot how quick you are.

1499
01:56:04,236 --> 01:56:05,897
My warrior woman.

1500
01:56:05,972 --> 01:56:08,600
She almost yanks my head clean off.

1501
01:56:08,674 --> 01:56:11,973
shoving my mouth into hers
so hard it hurts.

1502
01:56:12,044 --> 01:56:15,480
An explosion that blasts away
the dull, gray years

1503
01:56:15,548 --> 01:56:19,848
between the now and that one fiery night
when she was mine.

1504
01:56:20,720 --> 01:56:23,518
A hardtop with a decent engine.

1505
01:56:23,589 --> 01:56:25,955
And   make sure  it's got a  big trunk.

1506
01:56:28,027 --> 01:56:31,190
I'll always love you, baby.

1507
01:56:31,263 --> 01:56:35,131
Always... and never.

1508
01:56:43,142 --> 01:56:45,235
(Dwight) Where'd you find that heap?

1509
01:56:45,311 --> 01:56:48,838
Just look at that trunk.
We'll never fit 'em all in.

1510
01:56:48,914 --> 01:56:52,441
Gail? Unless there's something else
you want me to do,

1511
01:56:52,518 --> 01:56:54,509
you think maybe I could go home?

1512
01:56:54,587 --> 01:56:58,751
All this blood and stuff's got me kind of
feeling like maybe I'm gonna hurl.

1513
01:56:58,824 --> 01:57:01,019
Sure, Becky, go home.

1514
01:57:01,093 --> 01:57:03,891
But don't you talk to anybody,
not even your mom.

1515
01:57:03,963 --> 01:57:06,864
They'll never fit in that trunk.

1516
01:57:06,932 --> 01:57:10,698
Not like this, they won't.
Miho.

1517
01:57:11,137 --> 01:57:13,162
Dry your hair as soon as you get home!

1518
01:57:13,239 --> 01:57:15,366
You'll catch cold if you don't.

1519
01:57:15,441 --> 01:57:17,466
(squishing sounds)

1520
01:57:23,616 --> 01:57:25,208
Yeesh.

1521
01:57:27,119 --> 01:57:29,713
Hey, Becky.
Gail said no calls.

1522
01:57:29,789 --> 01:57:33,555
I just want to hear my mom's voice.
I won't tell her nothing.

1523
01:57:33,626 --> 01:57:36,254
Please, don't say nothing to Gail.

1524
01:57:38,764 --> 01:57:40,322
Hey, Mom?

1525
01:57:44,170 --> 01:57:45,899
Dizzy dames.

1526
01:57:45,971 --> 01:57:49,998
What were they thinking, sticking me
with a beat-up bucket of bolts like this?

1527
01:57:50,076 --> 01:57:52,772
We were barely able to get the trunk
to stay closed as it was,

1528
01:57:52,845 --> 01:57:54,506
we packed it so tight.

1529
01:57:54,580 --> 01:57:59,483
There wasn't anything we could do
but pile Jackie Boy in right next to me.

1530
01:57:59,552 --> 01:58:03,454
out where anybody who cares to look
will see him.

1531
01:58:04,657 --> 01:58:08,593
Go ahead. take one of his cigarettes.

1532
01:58:09,562 --> 01:58:11,427
It'll help.

1533
01:58:35,955 --> 01:58:40,324
It's got you smoking there, bud.

1534
01:58:44,864 --> 01:58:47,924
You shut the hell up, Jackie Boy.

1535
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,161
You're dead.

1536
01:58:50,236 --> 01:58:54,468
I'm just imagining this, so shut the hell up.

1537
01:58:54,540 --> 01:58:59,477
Well, it tells you something
about your state of mind, don't it?

1538
01:58:59,545 --> 01:59:01,979
It's got you hearing things.

1539
01:59:02,047 --> 01:59:05,210
It's got your nerves shot.

1540
01:59:05,284 --> 01:59:07,878
It's got you smoking.

1541
01:59:07,953 --> 01:59:11,946
You know it's true.

1542
01:59:12,024 --> 01:59:15,687
Nobody ever really quits.

1543
01:59:17,263 --> 01:59:22,030
A smoker's a smoker
when the chips are down.

1544
01:59:22,101 --> 01:59:27,004
- And your chips are down.
- I'm fine. You shut the hell up.

1545
01:59:28,374 --> 01:59:31,036
Will you look at that?

1546
01:59:32,558 --> 01:59:36,016
Ooh, those hookers let you down.

1547
01:59:37,363 --> 01:59:42,494
What are you gonna do
when you run outta gas, call AAA?

1548
01:59:42,568 --> 01:59:46,800
You sucker for the babes, you.

1549
01:59:46,872 --> 01:59:49,841
You ain't even gonna make it to the pits.

1550
01:59:49,909 --> 01:59:53,072
You shut the hell up.
I'll make it.

1551
01:59:53,145 --> 01:59:56,603
Not unless you keep
your eyes on the road, sugar pie.

1552
01:59:57,116 --> 02:00:00,711
- Watch it!
- (horn blaring)

1553
02:00:01,153 --> 02:00:03,178
Ah, this is great.

1554
02:00:03,255 --> 02:00:06,622
Just like being in a buddy movie.

1555
02:00:06,692 --> 02:00:09,058
Shut up!

1556
02:00:09,128 --> 02:00:10,720
(chuckles)

1557
02:00:11,764 --> 02:00:13,493
(siren blaring)

1558
02:00:15,935 --> 02:00:21,305
Boy, you're screwed.
You're out. You're finished.

1559
02:00:21,373 --> 02:00:27,278
Stick a fork in it. You're swirling
around the bottom of the bowl,

1560
02:00:27,346 --> 02:00:30,645
nose-diving down the pipe.

1561
02:00:30,716 --> 02:00:32,775
It's over.

1562
02:00:32,851 --> 02:00:35,376
You're flushed.

1563
02:00:35,454 --> 02:00:39,049
This time, I can't bring myself
to tell him to shut up.

1564
02:00:39,124 --> 02:00:42,457
Sure, he's an asshole.

1565
02:00:42,528 --> 02:00:45,156
Sure, he's dead.

1566
02:00:45,231 --> 02:00:48,860
Sure, I'm just imagining that he's talking.

1567
02:00:48,934 --> 02:00:52,995
None of that stops the bastard
from being absolutely right.

1568
02:00:53,072 --> 02:00:56,530
I don't have a chance in hell
of outrunning this cop.

1569
02:00:56,609 --> 02:00:58,839
Not in this heap.

1570
02:00:58,911 --> 02:01:01,436
Pull over!

1571
02:01:02,948 --> 02:01:06,475
The only question left
is whether I'm gonna kill him or not.

1572
02:01:06,552 --> 02:01:09,020
Tough call.

1573
02:01:09,088 --> 02:01:12,285
For all I know,
he's an honest cop, regular guy,

1574
02:01:12,358 --> 02:01:16,556
a working stiffwith a mortgage,
a wife and a pile of kids.

1575
02:01:16,629 --> 02:01:18,927
My hand moves all on its own,

1576
02:01:18,998 --> 02:01:23,025
sliding one of my guns to my lap
and thumbing back the hammer.

1577
02:01:25,204 --> 02:01:30,141
- I don't know what to do.
- You better stop. You're making him mad.

1578
02:01:31,510 --> 02:01:34,411
Whatever you say.

1579
02:01:34,480 --> 02:01:36,607
(tires screeching)

1580
02:01:41,387 --> 02:01:45,050
Your friend here...
party a little too hard tonight?

1581
02:01:46,625 --> 02:01:49,355
I'm the designated driver.

1582
02:01:55,100 --> 02:01:58,297
Well, you're driving with a busted tail light.

1583
02:02:03,575 --> 02:02:05,702
I'll let you off with a warning.

1584
02:02:13,485 --> 02:02:14,975
What next?

1585
02:02:19,191 --> 02:02:23,924
The tank goes dry
a quarter mile from the pits.

1586
02:02:23,996 --> 02:02:27,022
I shove the T-Bird the rest of the way.

1587
02:02:27,099 --> 02:02:30,364
A few minutes' more work
and it'll all be over.

1588
02:02:30,436 --> 02:02:33,803
Jackie Boy
will go into the damn tar pits.

1589
02:02:33,872 --> 02:02:38,104
I'll catch a train out of Sacred Oaks.
go home and call it a...

1590
02:02:38,177 --> 02:02:40,611
(gunshot)

1591
02:02:49,521 --> 02:02:51,648
No more questions, Dallas.
Do what I say.

1592
02:02:51,724 --> 02:02:55,455
Clear the streets.
We're in lockdown.

1593
02:02:55,527 --> 02:02:58,189
We're not selling any tail in Old Town.

1594
02:02:58,263 --> 02:03:00,629
Not tonight.

1595
02:03:04,036 --> 02:03:07,631
Don't struggle.
You'll only hurt yourself.

1596
02:03:07,706 --> 02:03:09,970
Your cause is lost.

1597
02:03:10,042 --> 02:03:11,805
We know everything.

1598
02:03:11,877 --> 02:03:15,938
Soon the corpse of Detective Rafferty
will be in our possession,

1599
02:03:16,014 --> 02:03:21,008
and the truce between your prostitutes
and the police will be shattered.

1600
02:03:21,086 --> 02:03:24,249
There'll be arrests.
There'll be deaths.

1601
02:03:24,323 --> 02:03:28,282
My employer will seize
what remains of this neighborhood.

1602
02:03:28,360 --> 02:03:32,922
You will all be slaves.
Nothing can stop this.

1603
02:03:32,998 --> 02:03:37,992
But it is within your power
to save many lives

1604
02:03:38,070 --> 02:03:42,473
by facilitating the process of transition,

1605
02:03:42,541 --> 02:03:47,877
by negotiating the terms
of the surrender of Old Town.

1606
02:03:48,514 --> 02:03:51,005
Son of a bitch!
I know you.

1607
02:03:51,083 --> 02:03:56,214
I have suffered your kind before -
the dregs of Sin City.

1608
02:03:56,288 --> 02:03:58,313
I serve a new master now,

1609
02:03:58,390 --> 02:04:03,225
and soon you and all your wretched kind
will serve him as well.

1610
02:04:03,295 --> 02:04:08,733
Now, get dressed and shed a tear
for Dwight McCarthy if you must,

1611
02:04:08,801 --> 02:04:12,362
because, by now, he is surely dead.

1612
02:04:12,438 --> 02:04:15,202
You don't know him.

1613
02:04:15,274 --> 02:04:18,539
My man will find a way.

1614
02:04:18,610 --> 02:04:21,670
He always finds a way.

1615
02:04:23,148 --> 02:04:25,173
I can't fathom
these Americans always whining

1616
02:04:25,250 --> 02:04:28,686
and going on about how they got it so bad.

1617
02:04:28,754 --> 02:04:31,052
This is a fine, grand country.

1618
02:04:31,123 --> 02:04:33,489
Guiding light of the modern world, it is.

1619
02:04:33,559 --> 02:04:36,790
Low taxes, land of opportunity.

1620
02:04:36,862 --> 02:04:40,491
Where else would one bullet buy us
the fortune that we're getting for this?

1621
02:04:40,566 --> 02:04:43,194
Sure beats the living hell
out of blowing up airports and churches

1622
02:04:43,268 --> 02:04:45,634
without shite to show for it.

1623
02:04:47,539 --> 02:04:49,564
Yeesh.

1624
02:04:50,642 --> 02:04:52,234
You find something, Murphy?

1625
02:04:52,311 --> 02:04:55,610
Looks to be our poor, dead cop's badge.

1626
02:04:55,681 --> 02:04:57,672
It's all bent up.

1627
02:04:57,749 --> 02:05:00,616
What's this stuck in it?

1628
02:05:00,686 --> 02:05:02,745
Bloody hell.
It's the bullet.

1629
02:05:11,930 --> 02:05:15,593
You son of a bitch!
Bastard!

1630
02:05:17,002 --> 02:05:19,232
They weren't cops. these four.

1631
02:05:19,304 --> 02:05:21,295
They were mercenaries.

1632
02:05:21,373 --> 02:05:23,637
And if they were hired
by who I think they were.

1633
02:05:23,942 --> 02:05:26,706
the bad times haven't even started yet.

1634
02:05:26,778 --> 02:05:30,270
And everything seemed
to be going so well.

1635
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:47,393
(man) Remember, we don't have to
deliver every last inch of the man, Brian.

1636
02:05:47,466 --> 02:05:49,764
(Brian) You got a good point there, Ronnie.

1637
02:05:49,835 --> 02:05:53,066
Lend me your knife.

1638
02:05:53,138 --> 02:05:56,232
Should I take a nap
while I'm doing all this waiting?

1639
02:05:56,308 --> 02:05:59,334
I'm at the bone, all right?

1640
02:06:01,547 --> 02:06:03,674
There we go.

1641
02:06:06,518 --> 02:06:10,784
Have you ever seen anything so pretty
in your whole life?

1642
02:06:11,723 --> 02:06:15,352
We'll be back for the three of you,
and if anyone happens by,

1643
02:06:15,427 --> 02:06:18,294
use your imagination, OK?

1644
02:06:28,173 --> 02:06:30,505
Silence. now.

1645
02:06:30,576 --> 02:06:32,976
No air to breathe.

1646
02:06:33,045 --> 02:06:37,106
Only the horrid. oily tar taste
creeping up my nostrils.

1647
02:06:38,383 --> 02:06:42,717
Let it in.
Let it fill your lungs.

1648
02:06:42,788 --> 02:06:46,451
They were counting on you
and you blew it.

1649
02:06:47,392 --> 02:06:51,726
Skinny, steely fingers at my wrist.

1650
02:06:51,797 --> 02:06:55,494
Miho, you're an angel.

1651
02:06:55,567 --> 02:06:57,467
You're a saint.

1652
02:06:57,536 --> 02:06:59,766
You're Mother Teresa.

1653
02:06:59,838 --> 02:07:01,897
You're Elvis.

1654
02:07:01,974 --> 02:07:04,204
You're God.

1655
02:07:04,910 --> 02:07:10,507
And if you'd shown up ten minutes
earlier, we'd still have Jackie Boy's head.

1656
02:07:10,949 --> 02:07:13,941
Dwight, they got Gail!

1657
02:07:14,987 --> 02:07:18,218
It's a cinch.
You got yourselves a spy in Old Town.

1658
02:07:18,290 --> 02:07:21,157
A stoolie who sold you out to the mob.

1659
02:07:21,226 --> 02:07:23,660
We gotta find out who it is and rescue Gail.

1660
02:07:23,729 --> 02:07:25,754
But first, we gotta get
our hands on Jackie Boy's head

1661
02:07:25,831 --> 02:07:30,063
before it gets to wherever it's going
and this whole situation blows wide open.

1662
02:07:30,135 --> 02:07:35,368
Miho, I hope to hell
you left one of 'em alive enough to talk.

1663
02:07:43,448 --> 02:07:46,542
I let him know I'm not fooling around.

1664
02:07:46,618 --> 02:07:49,712
(groans)

1665
02:07:51,289 --> 02:07:53,382
We talk.

1666
02:08:02,401 --> 02:08:06,201
Stay smart.
Stay cool.

1667
02:08:06,271 --> 02:08:09,729
It's time to prove to your friends
that you're worth a damn.

1668
02:08:09,808 --> 02:08:12,971
Sometimes, that means dying.

1669
02:08:13,045 --> 02:08:16,537
Sometimes, it means killing
a whole lot of people.

1670
02:08:16,615 --> 02:08:19,106
There they are.
What do we do?

1671
02:08:19,785 --> 02:08:21,343
We stop 'em, Dallas.

1672
02:08:29,628 --> 02:08:31,789
Jackie Boy's head is so close to me

1673
02:08:31,863 --> 02:08:35,697
I could almost reach out
and grab it right then and there.

1674
02:08:36,868 --> 02:08:38,267
(gunfire)

1675
02:08:40,972 --> 02:08:43,167
Get the head!
Get the head!

1676
02:08:44,810 --> 02:08:46,869
I got it!
I got it!

1677
02:08:53,618 --> 02:08:56,553
Suck on this, you stupid slag!

1678
02:09:00,392 --> 02:09:03,259
I can't tell if Miho is alive or dead.

1679
02:09:03,328 --> 02:09:08,061
but I'm on my feet and every ounce of me
wants to get some killing done.

1680
02:09:10,836 --> 02:09:15,330
You want the head now, sweetheart?
So come down and get it!

1681
02:09:20,078 --> 02:09:22,273
Brave lad.

1682
02:09:22,347 --> 02:09:26,283
I could've put a bullet
straight down your ear just now,

1683
02:09:26,351 --> 02:09:30,117
if I hadn't got me revolver
all wet and useless.

1684
02:09:30,188 --> 02:09:32,486
You got the drop on me, love.

1685
02:09:32,557 --> 02:09:35,025
I'm as helpless as a baby.

1686
02:09:42,033 --> 02:09:44,866
I got to come clean with you, sweetheart.

1687
02:09:44,936 --> 02:09:49,964
It was an outright lie I was giving ya
about me revolver being wet.

1688
02:09:50,041 --> 02:09:52,669
You see, I'm not too fond of shootin'.

1689
02:09:52,744 --> 02:09:55,838
It's my preference to blow things up.

1690
02:09:55,914 --> 02:09:58,314
Once you blast the roof off a pub

1691
02:09:58,383 --> 02:10:02,149
and seen all the parts flying off people,

1692
02:10:02,220 --> 02:10:06,156
a little bang bang's
never gonna match the sight of that.

1693
02:10:06,224 --> 02:10:11,992
And here's me, with all these fine grenades
and such a sweet beauty of a remote.

1694
02:10:12,063 --> 02:10:15,555
But it's me knife I'll be doing you with.

1695
02:10:15,634 --> 02:10:18,262
You killed me mates.

1696
02:10:18,336 --> 02:10:22,796
Someone shoulda told ya - never give
an lrishman good cause for revenge.

1697
02:10:24,776 --> 02:10:26,937
Deadly little Miho.

1698
02:10:27,746 --> 02:10:30,544
You won't feel a thing
unless she wants you to.

1699
02:10:30,615 --> 02:10:33,413
She twists the blade.

1700
02:10:33,852 --> 02:10:35,251
He feels it.

1701
02:10:38,089 --> 02:10:41,855
I tell Miho what we're gonna do
and how we're gonna do it.

1702
02:10:41,927 --> 02:10:46,421
I grab poor Dallas's car phone and make
the most important call of my life.

1703
02:10:46,498 --> 02:10:51,458
First, we gotta rescue Gail.
then comes the kill.

1704
02:10:51,536 --> 02:10:55,495
The big, fat kill.

1705
02:11:04,649 --> 02:11:05,741
(groans)

1706
02:11:05,817 --> 02:11:08,684
Do we just gotta stand here
and watch this?

1707
02:11:08,753 --> 02:11:10,880
What, are you kidding me, man?

1708
02:11:10,956 --> 02:11:14,392
I could watch old Manute do his thing
all night long and not get tired of it.

1709
02:11:14,459 --> 02:11:15,949
I mean, the man's an artist.

1710
02:11:16,027 --> 02:11:21,124
Only an artist should be allowed
to touch such a beautiful subject.

1711
02:11:21,199 --> 02:11:23,133
Your skin is perfect.

1712
02:11:23,201 --> 02:11:26,364
Your nerves, responsive.

1713
02:11:26,438 --> 02:11:27,735
Beautiful.

1714
02:11:27,806 --> 02:11:30,900
Just give them what they want, Gail.

1715
02:11:34,946 --> 02:11:38,006
- Becky?
- It's over, Gail.

1716
02:11:38,683 --> 02:11:42,483
There's no fighting them.
Dwight's dead.

1717
02:11:42,554 --> 02:11:44,749
They got what's left of that cop we killed.

1718
02:11:44,823 --> 02:11:47,815
The mob's gonna turn it over to the police
chief, the cops are gonna mow us down.

1719
02:11:47,893 --> 02:11:49,827
We gotta cut a deal.

1720
02:11:49,895 --> 02:11:53,490
You little bitch!
You sold us out!

1721
02:11:53,565 --> 02:11:56,591
I didn't have no choice!
They was gonna hurt my mom.

1722
02:11:56,668 --> 02:11:58,863
You gotta cut a deal with these people.

1723
02:11:58,937 --> 02:12:01,064
It's selfish, you holding out like this.

1724
02:12:01,139 --> 02:12:03,767
You're gonna get a lot of girls killed
for no good reason.

1725
02:12:03,842 --> 02:12:06,333
It wasn't your mom!

1726
02:12:06,411 --> 02:12:09,574
We could have protected her
and you know it.

1727
02:12:09,648 --> 02:12:12,344
It was the money, you stupid little bitch!

1728
02:12:12,417 --> 02:12:16,319
Sure, there's money. Sure, you could've
moved my mom into Old Town

1729
02:12:16,388 --> 02:12:19,152
and let her know
that her daughter's a goddamn whore.

1730
02:12:19,224 --> 02:12:21,351
Breaks your heart, doesn't it?

1731
02:12:21,426 --> 02:12:26,193
They offered me what you couldn't
never offer me - a way out.

1732
02:12:26,264 --> 02:12:28,198
I had to watch out for my own neck.

1733
02:12:28,266 --> 02:12:29,961
Your neck.

1734
02:12:30,035 --> 02:12:34,165
Your precious, scrawny little neck!

1735
02:12:34,239 --> 02:12:35,831
(screams)

1736
02:12:38,276 --> 02:12:42,337
You're crazy! You could have
ripped my throat out, you crazy whore!

1737
02:12:43,915 --> 02:12:47,407
Schutz, fetch my blades.

1738
02:12:47,485 --> 02:12:51,512
- Stuka, kill this one.
- No, I was promised!

1739
02:12:51,589 --> 02:12:54,353
Stupid little bitch!
You deserve worse!

1740
02:12:54,426 --> 02:12:57,953
I knew there was a reason
I got out of bed this morning.

1741
02:12:59,898 --> 02:13:01,957
Hey.

1742
02:13:02,434 --> 02:13:04,265
Hey.

1743
02:13:05,103 --> 02:13:06,730
Nobody.
I don't see nobody.

1744
02:13:06,805 --> 02:13:10,468
Will you look at that?
It's right through me. Guys, look.

1745
02:13:10,542 --> 02:13:13,443
There's something wrapped around it.

1746
02:13:13,511 --> 02:13:15,240
Some kind of note.

1747
02:13:15,313 --> 02:13:17,577
Give it to me.

1748
02:13:17,649 --> 02:13:20,550
It's poked right through me.
Guys, look.

1749
02:13:22,020 --> 02:13:24,682
- It's starting to really hurt.
- Out back. Everyone.

1750
02:13:24,756 --> 02:13:26,621
And  bring the women.

1751
02:13:26,691 --> 02:13:29,922
Do you think somebody
should call me a doctor or something?

1752
02:13:30,495 --> 02:13:32,656
McCarthy, you fool.

1753
02:13:34,332 --> 02:13:35,390
Hey.

1754
02:13:36,568 --> 02:13:37,933
Guys?

1755
02:13:40,171 --> 02:13:41,638
Aw.

1756
02:13:44,509 --> 02:13:48,741
Dozens ofthem, armed to the teeth.

1757
02:13:48,813 --> 02:13:52,806
I'm outnumbered, outgunned.

1758
02:13:52,884 --> 02:13:58,481
But the alley is crooked,
dark and very narrow.

1759
02:13:58,556 --> 02:14:01,218
They can't surround me.

1760
02:14:01,292 --> 02:14:06,423
Sometimes you can beat the odds
with the careful choice of where to fight.

1761
02:14:10,702 --> 02:14:13,193
You can have Old Town, I don't care.

1762
02:14:13,972 --> 02:14:17,931
- Just give me the woman.
- (muffled speaking)

1763
02:14:18,009 --> 02:14:20,000
Shut up.

1764
02:14:20,078 --> 02:14:23,070
Dwight, don't do this.

1765
02:14:23,148 --> 02:14:27,517
- Hey, wait a minute. Something's not right.
- Shut up, or I'll plug you!

1766
02:14:27,585 --> 02:14:31,112
Of course, Mr. McCarthy.
A fair trade.

1767
02:14:31,189 --> 02:14:32,986
She's all yours.

1768
02:14:41,866 --> 02:14:46,701
Now, if you'll explain to me why
we shouldn't blow both of you to pieces...

1769
02:14:46,771 --> 02:14:50,571
Dwight, what have you done?

1770
02:14:50,642 --> 02:14:52,667
Exactly what I had to.

1771
02:14:54,012 --> 02:14:56,606
Every step of the way.

1772
02:14:59,117 --> 02:15:02,177
No! It isn't right!
There wasn't no tape over his mouth!

1773
02:15:02,253 --> 02:15:04,653
How come there's tape over his mouth?

1774
02:15:17,001 --> 02:15:19,265
Where to fight counts for a lot.

1775
02:15:19,337 --> 02:15:24,070
Cute trick, McCarthy,
but it will do you do good.

1776
02:15:24,142 --> 02:15:28,238
But there's nothing like having
your friends show up with lots of guns.

1777
02:15:28,313 --> 02:15:31,214
No!
McCarthy, you shit!

1778
02:15:33,751 --> 02:15:36,549
The girls all know the score.

1779
02:15:37,689 --> 02:15:43,218
No escape. no surrender. no mercy.

1780
02:15:43,294 --> 02:15:47,196
We gotta kill every last
rat bastard one of 'em.

1781
02:15:47,265 --> 02:15:49,460
Every last one.

1782
02:15:49,534 --> 02:15:53,766
Not for revenge.
not because they deserve it.

1783
02:15:53,838 --> 02:15:57,035
not because it'll make
the world a better place.

1784
02:15:58,176 --> 02:16:00,007
We need a heap of bloody bodies

1785
02:16:00,078 --> 02:16:04,105
so when mob boss Wallenquist
looks over his charts of profits and losses.

1786
02:16:04,182 --> 02:16:08,516
he'll see what it cost him
to mess with the girls of Old Town.

1787
02:16:18,229 --> 02:16:21,027
They run out back.

1788
02:16:21,099 --> 02:16:24,000
Right on schedule.

1789
02:16:35,880 --> 02:16:38,212
Deadly little Miho.

1790
02:16:39,784 --> 02:16:42,776
She gets her practice in.

1791
02:16:42,854 --> 02:16:46,051
The Valkyrie at my side
is shouting and laughing

1792
02:16:46,124 --> 02:16:51,494
with the pure, hateful,
bloodthirsty joy of the slaughter,

1793
02:16:51,563 --> 02:16:53,895
and so am I.

1794
02:16:58,870 --> 02:17:00,895
The fire baby.

1795
02:17:00,972 --> 02:17:03,770
It'll burn us both.

1796
02:17:03,841 --> 02:17:07,800
There's no place in this world
for our kind of fire.

1797
02:17:07,879 --> 02:17:12,248
my warrior woman, my Valkyrie.

1798
02:17:12,317 --> 02:17:15,218
You'll always be mine.

1799
02:17:15,286 --> 02:17:17,447
Always...

1800
02:17:17,522 --> 02:17:19,217
and never.
