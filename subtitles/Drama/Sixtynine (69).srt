1
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,299
Thank god!
That was in the nick of time.

2
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,239
Here it is.

3
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:20,069
Come, let's go.

4
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,280
- 200 grams of unpolished rice.
- 200 grams of small Chinese, coming up.

5
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,189
Unpolished.

6
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,950
The "Rice Crispies" has always been
unpolished if you ask me.

7
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,150
And some south German fruit fiber.

8
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:04,920
East- or West- German?

9
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,489
Never mind, they're from
Lammefjorden anyway.

10
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,669
And half a kilo black soybeans.
Aaahh, black beans...

11
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,250
Sexy food, right.

12
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,300
You don't need to comment on
everything. Just serve me.

13
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,560
Everything else just bothers
my stomach and me.

14
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,789
- Does it want anything more? The stomach...
- Crushed ring flower.

15
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,250
Crushed? No, don't be so cruel.

16
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,860
And some sweet rosehip marmalade.

17
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,870
- Anything else?
- Yes, a few Sunflower seeds.

18
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,080
- How many?
- 927.

19
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,780
927, yes.

20
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,409
What????

21
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,860
Jensen, do you have a minute?

22
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,830
- What is so funny?
- It's my Danish colleague.

23
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,050
Never mind. Here.

24
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,969
- How much sunflower seed?
- 700 grams.
- 700 grams!?

25
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,909
"700 grams of sunflower seeds"
Piece by piece!

26
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,580
How long is Ms. "Swedish sun block" going
to be here? She makes me nervous!

27
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,960
She doesn't leave until the Swedish
intelligence agency decides

28
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,800
that she can't find any more
terrorists in Denmark.

29
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:21,050
Could you at least send her out to the market?

30
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:24,780
And let her sell mish-mash food in a kiosk.

31
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,689
Jensen, I get the feeling you don't
take our undercover operation seriously.

32
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,659
If the intelligence agency told me to work
in a health food store -

33
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,280
just to please the intelligence agency, then...

34
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,409
Why can't I go out in the field?

35
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,050
Isn't it time to forget that incident over
at the Russian embassy?

36
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,050
When an agent gets shit-faced on Russian
vodka and takes a young Russian female...

37
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,969
Aren't you allowed to invite a young
lady out for a sleigh ride?

38
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,430
- In the middle of the summer?
- Nobody's perfect.

39
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,620
At least I found out she
was a Russian agent.

40
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:01,340
And then questioned her at
the Bolsjoj-ballet.

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,560
She didn't know anything about any
long-distance-missiles.

42
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,590
Jensen!

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,469
Watch out for the ladies.

44
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:11,289
Do you know about a
professor Neubau?

45
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,150
Yes, he's a German scientist
who lives in Denmark.

46
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,699
Who is trying to come up
with a substance to replace oil?

47
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:21,439
- He died three days ago.
- Rest his soul.

48
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,360
And his substance now exists.

49
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,529
Just before his death, he took
some pictures of his invention.

50
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,649
- We have that microfilm.
- Good for you boss.

51
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:36,730
On the other hand, only the CIA can
process that type of film.

52
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,870
Neubau contacted Carter-

53
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,879
and one of his agents picked up the film.

54
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:47,250
Your job is to guard the courier so that
he can deliver the film safely.

55
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:55,158
A lot of people would like to get their hands
on that substance, Jensen.

56
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,160
What?

57
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,410
What is it boss?

58
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,949
The Danish intelligence agency is going to
deliver Neubaus substance to the CIA.

59
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,360
I could sell that microfilm to the
Sheik of Obec for ten million crowns.

60
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:12,060
Have you tried to buy it from the Danes, boss?

61
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,889
Matty Hari, you know very well that the
Scorpio doesn't buy, he takes!

62
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,350
- But, I have a good plan.
- Fucking great, boss!

63
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,560
The bag.

64
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,660
Thanks.

65
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,910
In order to fool the enemy, we have
made this bag with samples.

66
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:42,329
This little rye bread flavored with
brewer's yeast is extraordinary.

67
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,250
We've baked it with the microfilm inside.

68
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,569
No, the courier gets the bag.

69
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,370
Just to be sure, we'll
do the double bag trick.

70
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,290
Here's your bag Jensen.
Without the microfilm.

71
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:09,040
Jensen, beware of the ladies!

72
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:11,689
Yes, sure, chief!

73
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:15,079
The code is: "Do you need a healthy young man"

74
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,160
"who knows health-food, yoga,
ropy milk and thick yogurt?"

75
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,029
Dismissed!

76
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,910
Yes boss.

77
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,139
Yes, my son.
That's how you were conceived.

78
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:17,850
Your father and I worked together
in the intelligence agency.

79
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,089
It was a dangerous place to work.

80
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:26,930
We were so in love we
forgot all about that.

81
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:32,120
Everything about the Scorpio and all the
top-secret papers we took from him.

82
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:52,500
It was wonderful.

83
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:05,149
The Scorpio! Let's go!

84
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,299
That assignment cost your father his life.

85
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,889
And if I ever catch him

86
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,009
I'll strangle him to death.

87
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,830
You should never turn the other cheek.

88
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,470
Sure it was terrible that he
killed my father

89
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,100
but he knew the risks
when he took the job.

90
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,840
You should at least be able
to speak to him about it.

91
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,289
You don't speak with scorpions.

92
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:38,639
You stomp on them!
And if not, they run away.

93
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,799
That's what I'm going to do.
Eh, run away...

94
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,940
- I'm going to apply for a job, ciao!
- Bye my son.

95
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,269
What do you want?

96
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,370
- Ropy milk?
- Yes, that and high yogurt.

97
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,230
Well, it's that way.

98
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,860
So, was it ropy milk and high yogurt?

99
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,220
Hello, you're right on time.

100
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:29,659
- Am I?
- Sure you are. Right on the dot!

101
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,009
Nobody told me that before.

102
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,279
- I'm not ashamed...
- Why would you be ashamed?

103
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,129
- That's what my mother always tells me.
- She does. Who is she, your mother?

104
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,320
- Mrs. Irma Andersen.
- Irma Andersen?

105
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,350
Young man, may I shake your hand?

106
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,120
It's an honor to shake the hand of
the son of the woman

107
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:03,850
who made this country what it is today.

108
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,460
There isn't a better woman
in the whole of Denmark!

109
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,039
Well...

110
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,649
May I call you by your Christian name?

111
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:13,409
Yes, it's Arnold.

112
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:17,360
Arnold, it's so Danish.
Yes, typical Danish.

113
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:20,809
Like your mother.

114
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:23,149
Well Arnold, let's cut to the chase.

115
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:30,019
Here's the bag with the samples,
and a train ticket to Bromby.

116
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,120
You'll be picked up by a
big white Buick Skylark

117
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:38,269
that will take you to the Northern
European Meditation Centre.

118
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,659
Allow me to wish you a... pleasant trip...

119
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,669
Tally-ho!

120
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,240
Jensen!

121
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:49,059
Yes boss?

122
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,029
Do you have any idea who that was?
It was Irma Andersen's son.

123
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,360
Irma Andersen?

124
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:58,960
She who took care of the
men in a shower cabin?

125
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,789
- Irma la Douche.
- Exactly. That was her son.

126
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,740
Check him out, Jensen.

127
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,120
- And remember: beware of the ladies.
- Sure boss.

128
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,529
Yes, mother.

129
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:16,389
I didn't know they needed this many
people in the health-food business.

130
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,419
Yes, I got the job.

131
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,279
Good my son.

132
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:26,190
Now, you work hard with the healthy
food and don't go to bed too late.

133
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:28,629
Okay.

134
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,919
Bye for now.

135
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:42,299
The intelligence agency's courier
is on a train to Bromby.

136
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,139
And he has a bag full of...
... health-food products?!

137
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:50,019
Find out who he is, and what
kind of bag he uses.

138
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:54,399
Alfa Bravo Charlie Delta, come in.

139
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,220
- What can I do for you?
- Do you need someone

140
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,840
who knows health food, yoga, ropy milk and thick yogurt?

141
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:14,610
- It's ropy milk and thick yogurt.
- Oooh... Give me a minute.

142
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,169
- Stick 'em up!
- What?

143
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:35,909
"Ropy milk and thick yogurt"
Do you think we're idiots?

144
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,929
Where you from?

145
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,269
Russia? China? Albania?
Or even worse, are you from Norway?

146
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:47,879
My boss is Jimmy Carter, president
of the United States of America.

147
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,580
- Can you prove it?
- I've got a tape.

148
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,570
Let's hear it.

149
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,809
To whom it may concern.

150
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,179
I hereby confirm that this man,
Hubert W. Horsepower-

151
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:09,129
- really does represent the United
States government.

152
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:12,009
Spoken, and signed, by Jimmy Carter.
Please believe...

153
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:15,360
If you're the courier, who is...

154
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,509
Taxi!

155
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,210
There he is, the CIA guy
Hubert W. Horsepower.

156
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,960
It's Jensen who is the courier.
I repeat. Jensen is the courier.

157
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:55,580
He has a white Thai Air bag.

158
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,409
Got it. Lizzie is on her way.
I repeat. Lizzie is on her way.

159
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,879
- Over and out.
- Yes, boss.

160
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:49,259
Come on! We have to catch
that fucking train!

161
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,610
Shit!!

162
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,029
Penny, I'm going to Bromby
to assassinate Andersen.

163
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:00,169
And find out how much his
mother knows. Hurry!!

164
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,769
- Hi, could I speak to Mr. Arnold Andersson?
- He's not at home.

165
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,759
- But he lives here, right?
- Yes.

166
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:56,490
- Are you his mother?
- No.

167
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,069
- Is his mother at home?
- Yes.

168
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,880
Ah fuck, I don't have all day. Can I speak to her!?

169
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:12,180
Berta, who was it who...

170
00:18:12,362 --> 00:18:16,018
- Lizzie, is everything under control?
- Yes, yes.

171
00:18:16,072 --> 00:18:19,036
Get onboard.

172
00:18:19,344 --> 00:18:23,920
I'm just here to ask a few simple questions.
And as soon as you answer them I'm...

173
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:02,539
- What are you doing?
- I'm locking the door. No compromises.

174
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:04,519
Yes, but...

175
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,210
No buts. Fuck me.

176
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,670
Yes, but...

177
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,920
"Beware of the ladies"

178
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,799
I'm going to.

179
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,759
Who is he?

180
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,319
Who's are these?

181
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,470
- But...
- Where is he?

182
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,500
Are you cheating on me with a Tyrolean?

183
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,400
- A Tyrolean! You must be out of your mind!
- I'm going to find out who this guy is.

184
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:49,299
My flower.
My dove... my darling... .

185
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,589
Big, bad, stupid, wonderful boy...

186
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,230
Close your eyes and be ready.

187
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,910
- Close your eyes.
- Yes, but not too long right?

188
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:02,680
Not too long.

189
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:08,779
Come here.

190
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,289
Aaah, fuck!

191
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:19,140
- Would Mr. and Mrs. like anything to eat?
- Thanks, we have something.

192
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,670
Is this the fist time you've met Mr. Jensen?

193
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:24,539
He can be quite a guy if you don't know him.

194
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:26,869
I know where I've got him.

195
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:29,180
"He who has no trousers"

196
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,250
"has to show his bare ass. "

197
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,380
Move it.
What do you think this is? A field trip?

198
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,190
I thought so.
Special corset number four.

199
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:44,769
That is the same old crap
we used in my time.

200
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:48,470
- Do you remember this one?
- Sure, it's a great piece.

201
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:52,269
That's when I knocked everybody out.

202
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,190
The panties!

203
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:02,900
Now, that's clever. A nylon rope.

204
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:06,230
That we didn't have!

205
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:11,930
We'd like an explanation.

206
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,400
- A bowl to mix the salad in?
- Thanks, we have everything we need.

207
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:24,940
Please give us a...

208
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,049
... bottle of cognac.

209
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,119
- Was this really Jensen's bag?
- We were to only ones in the bathroom.

210
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:40,150
It wasn't meant as a critique.

211
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,980
No, I get it! Jensen wasn't
the only one in the compartment.

212
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,079
I think they just pulled the double bag trick.

213
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,609
The double bag trick?

214
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,670
Beautiful day isn't it?

215
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,609
How could a fake courier fool you?

216
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:40,279
No problem.
We'll get there when the train arrives.

217
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,200
The other one has to be the real courier.

218
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:46,440
Wait here.

219
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:07,910
Pardon me, what is it you're reading?

220
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,680
It's a brochure from the North
European Meditation Centre.

221
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,410
- You're going to attend a course?
- Do you practice yoga?

222
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,809
No, just the thought of uncomfortable
positions makes be dizzy.

223
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:25,190
That's because you're not doing it right.

224
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:29,480
The most important part is
to relax. I'll show you.

225
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,470
The Lotus position, the easiest one.

226
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,420
It's the basis for all other positions.

227
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,369
You should be able to do that one.
Even without any practice.

228
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,640
There you go.

229
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:50,349
I'll be damned; the Scorpio is really
into healthy food these days.

230
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:56,339
And then the more tricky position.
"The Ox Frog".

231
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,140
You have to be careful not to lock yourself up.

232
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:19,819
If you twist my shoulder...

233
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,789
- Like that.
- Now I'm locked.

234
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:25,210
Keep up the good work.

235
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,859
What are you doing?

236
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,269
You can't...

237
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,750
Ciao.

238
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:37,150
I'm stuck.
You have to help me!

239
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,890
That's dreadful. Come back here!

240
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:46,038
My Arnold is neither a half nor double, nor
complete agent! He doesn't know about this?

241
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:53,720
How awful. My boss is on his way to kill him.
He thinks he's one of the Scorpio's henchmen.

242
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:54,500
The Scorpio?

243
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,059
There's no time to lose.

244
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,089
The panties?

245
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,819
Aha!

246
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:06,390
Do you have anything else stuck down there?

247
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,259
- Stop it.
- What was it we did last time?

248
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,700
What the hell is it?

249
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,160
What the hell?

250
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:24,339
Where is she!? Who is she?!

251
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,269
I demand an explanation!

252
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,369
- I'm sorry they just...
- I can't leave you alone for one second!

253
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:34,589
Will you admit to it now? Or do
I have to punish you even more?

254
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:39,599
"Beware of the ladies, Jensen!"

255
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,559
Yes... whatever...

256
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,920
What is the world coming to?

257
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,359
When I was young

258
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:54,769
people like that were
punished in medieval ways!

259
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:59,099
When you were young,
the train hadn't been invented yet.

260
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,599
Mon dieu

261
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,230
Faster! Anything could happen with
the Scorpio in the picture.

262
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:18,740
It's impossible.
It can't be true.

263
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,289
Do Mr. and Mrs. wish anything to
drink with the hors d'oeuvres?

264
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,119
Perhaps a Chateau Rothschild '55?

265
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,339
Give us a bottle of whisky!

266
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,809
No film.

267
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,039
Perhaps they did the triple bag trick?

268
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,920
- Nah, it's too clever.
- The triple bag trick?

269
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,380
We have to find the Scorpio.

270
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,009
- Any sparkling water?
- No.

271
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:01,599
It's Citron-Brge and Matty.
We don't have, I repeat...

272
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:04,569
We don't have the merchandise.

273
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:07,470
- Idiots! Come.
- Okay boss.

274
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,970
Go directly to Bromberg. I repeat,
go directly to Bromberg!

275
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,539
You got it boss. Over and out!

276
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:23,720
Do you get any discount if you
count the miles...

277
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:28,940
... or the crossroads we've passed?

278
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,440
Frankly.

279
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,660
I can tell something has happened.

280
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,420
The question is whether or
not I should get involved.

281
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,369
Push my shoulder.

282
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:45,809
It's about fucking time.

283
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:50,200
Young man, watch your language.
Or I'll twist you up again.

284
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,990
A double knot!

285
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:57,509
Who the hell has the real bag?!

286
00:27:58,039 --> 00:27:59,930
And where is Lizzie?

287
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,279
No idea.
And, we're in Bromby now.

288
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,240
Now, don't forget the bill.

289
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,660
Two coffees, a bottle of
cognac and a... bottle of whisky

290
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:17,440
That's 789 and 50 sir, including cleaning.

291
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,809
I'm in the health food business.

292
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,609
I'd like to go to the North
European Meditation Centre.

293
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:41,029
- Should we take him now?
- No, let's follow him.

294
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,630
You have no idea what I've been through.

295
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,319
I bet any minute now a
naked woman will come running...

296
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,680
... along the tracks...

297
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,259
My lord!

298
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,200
Let's take him here.

299
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:37,539
- What about the fake courier?
- Aaahhh. As long as the microfilm is there.

300
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,289
My lord.

301
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,839
Then, it's just to Bromberg and
deliver the merchandise.

302
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,490
Step on it, Berta.

303
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,630
What has happened?

304
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:50,000
What are you doing?

305
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,619
- It's my brother.
- Your brother?

306
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,230
You Copenhageners have a way with family.

307
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,869
The bag, dammit!

308
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,569
Where is the bag?

309
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:29,380
Did you see who's lying here?

310
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:32,779
Government employees
They sleep all day.

311
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,140
- Where is bag?
- The hell with the bag!

312
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,339
He didn't carry the microfilm in the bag.
He has it on him!

313
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,750
Let's take him!

314
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,430
Just a second.

315
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:00,509
Are you bringing your guide dog with you... ?

316
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,519
- Keep an eye on him?
- Okay.

317
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,559
The gents are expected.

318
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,369
The prophet is expecting you in the
meditation hall in about 20 minutes.

319
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,000
Shit!

320
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,070
- Okay, we're safe.
- Shouldn't we deliver the bag now?

321
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,880
No.

322
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:47,139
I'm tired of picking roasted
chestnuts from an open fire.

323
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,789
If only Jensen hadn't messed
up the code word.

324
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,679
I'm going to give it to him...

325
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,989
He's going to have the shock
of his lifetime.

326
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,829
I'm going to enjoy the look on Jensen's
face when he thinks the microfilm is gone.

327
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,380
Come on.
Let's visit the prophet.

328
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:49,800
Damn, this is way better then doing dirty
secret agent work in South America.

329
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,340
Bravo!

330
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,340
Bravo!

331
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,429
Dear colleagues, there's been
a little misunderstanding.

332
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
So, the film arrived with the wrong courier.

333
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,250
But I managed

334
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,679
to avoid further catastrophies.
So, my dear gentleman... I now give you. . , .

335
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,880
the treasured micro fiii...

336
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,260
... iine weather we have today, sir.

337
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:26,670
The Scorpio. We're ruined!

338
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:35,349
- That's terrible.
- What happened?

339
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,989
What do ya mean?

340
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:42,960
This was in the car.
And it's Arnolds!

341
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,719
Is something wrong?

342
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:49,349
No, we just arrived.

343
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,219
I'll call for help; I'm just going to
give these chefs a ride to Blomberg.

344
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,429
Bromberg?

345
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,230
That's more like it!

346
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:10,000
Which of you gentlemen has the microfilm?

347
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,960
- Hmmm... I'll find out.
- What film?

348
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:16,670
Why do you think you're here?

349
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:20,210
I'm here to deliver a bag,
with a few samples in it

350
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,630
and then go home, I guess.

351
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:24,480
Mister Virgin himself!

352
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,510
Let's play a game of pool.

353
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:30,360
Why not a game of Carambole.

354
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,909
Let's play the winner
goes first into treatment.

355
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,789
This is Kokonono...

356
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:43,289
Kokonono guards my upper half...

357
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,480
. . and little Billy here,
guards my lower parts.

358
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:49,530
I don't want to do this.
I can't play.

359
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,889
- I'm saying who's in or not.
- But, I can't play pool.

360
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,869
You'd better learn then, fast as hell...

361
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,420
I've always dreamt of
learning how to play pool.

362
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:09,960
We made it in.

363
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:15,800
Understood.

364
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:19,139
- Berta... Let's do this.
- Yes.

365
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:24,119
I'm first. What a bad position.

366
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:34,670
The first one to go down
13 points will be first.

367
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,030
If you don't give me the film...

368
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,110
- I know nothing.
- That's what everybody says.

369
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:43,489
Think positively my young man.
Do you want to start?

370
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,659
I don't know.

371
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,630
My talents can't be bought
for a game of pool.

372
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,389
I don't want to.

373
00:39:57,639 --> 00:40:01,610
It's incredible how fast you can
learn to appreciate pool.

374
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,030
That's minus six points.
Mark it ladies.

375
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,440
- You're next, my dear colleague.
- Thanks.

376
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:20,179
It's my turn.

377
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,590
Pardon me.

378
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,480
It's nothing.

379
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:33,090
- You don't understand that.
- Thanks.

380
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:35,429
Welcome.

381
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,969
That's minus four points.
Mark it ladies.

382
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:41,480
- Now it's our foreign friend.
- I'm ready.

383
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,050
That's plus four points.
Mark it ladies.

384
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:08,289
Now the big shot.

385
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,309
Is this the intelligence agency?

386
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,820
You're speaking to Agent 69 Jensen.
Could I speak to...

387
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,860
What? Are you in a meeting?

388
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,119
It's very important...

389
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:23,380
What? Closed up?

390
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,650
I need a helicopter, right away!

391
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:30,329
Could I send in an order for one?
No, no I don't have the time!

392
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,769
Are all my rights to
book helicopters revoked?

393
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,840
I have to deal with a very
awkward situation here.

394
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:44,690
No, I do not have my boss'
rights to override the budget.

395
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:47,420
Work permits?

396
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,019
Well, I hereby order four copies...

397
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,739
. . in reasonable office hours.

398
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:55,679
Go to hell!

399
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,780
That was minus six points.

400
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:06,119
The pleasure is all yours.

401
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:08,769
Or tell me where the microfilm is.

402
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,809
- I don't know anything.
- Do I have to force you?

403
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,960
Once I'm out of here

404
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:18,289
I'm going to file a complaint
with the sportmen's association!

405
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,510
I'm getting you kicked out of
the Danish Pool Federation!

406
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,449
I'm going to...

407
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:26,500
It's a pretty fun game...

408
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,260
Ten minus, mark it ladies.

409
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:44,019
What about a little drink.

410
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,590
Yes please.

411
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,719
I've seen that face before.

412
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,489
I have to look at this a little closer,
when we've found the microfilm.

413
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,750
It's not in my room.

414
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,800
If it is, we're going to find it.

415
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,179
Shall we continue? Whose turn is it?

416
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,019
You!

417
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,349
Who are you?

418
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,849
Next time, wear something smaller,
and comfortable.

419
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Its ladies like that you should hire

420
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,409
instead of those ugly women the
intelligence agency sends you.

421
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:30,190
Shall we continue?

422
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,309
It's almost impossible to focus on this
game when he runs around like that!

423
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,329
- Play!
- Play!

424
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,590
You gave me a tough nut to crack.

425
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,599
That's fucking beautiful.
Six points plus!

426
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,409
Look through all rooms.
I want that microfilm!

427
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:28,519
Go to work!

428
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:39,349
Let's check the next room.

429
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,250
And I'll do the boss' room.

430
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,929
And I'm going to search this good.

431
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,849
I want guards on all doors.
Understood?

432
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,809
Whose little girl are you?

433
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:04,750
Are you shy?

434
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:07,590
You're new here right?

435
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:11,739
Then it was good you bumped into me.

436
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:16,809
Because I'm the one in charge,
next to the Scorpio of course.

437
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:19,530
He let's me deal with everything.

438
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:25,519
So if you want things to done.
Just ask Citron-Brge here.

439
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:29,909
And I'll to take care if it...
If you know what I mean.

440
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,679
Why are you so afraid of
showing your face?

441
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:38,889
You're ass looks so beautiful.

442
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,059
The Scorpio and I
like beautiful girls.

443
00:46:43,639 --> 00:46:47,329
We definitely like young
girls who are willing.

444
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:52,610
When we meet girls like that...

445
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:56,170
... we want to stuff them really good.
If you know what I mean.

446
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:01,180
This is the first lesson in sanitary engineering.

447
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,680
In Citron-Brge's course for new cleaning ladies.

448
00:47:04,681 --> 00:47:08,438
Just give in, and learn how to
please a feather duster.

449
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,860
Oooh... Nooo

450
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,679
No, I mean yes...

451
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:23,070
You see this is not that bad?
It's wonderful.

452
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:26,250
Oh no.

453
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,789
Aaah...

454
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,630
You have what it takes. Tomorrow
I'll teach you how to do vacuuming.

455
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,639
But until then, I'll give
you great references

456
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:42,460
that you can use when you're
done cleaning here.

457
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:49,019
When it comes to imitating the prime
minister's signature, I'm a wizard.

458
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,159
I can do several other signatures too...

459
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,500
What the hell.

460
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,559
Berta.

461
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,829
- We've got to find Arnold.
- Yes, but what about the guard?

462
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,489
I've got an idea, come on.

463
00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:44,429
Boss! Boss! The film is gone.
She took it.

464
00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:46,460
- Who is she?
- The cleaning lady.

465
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,489
I knew there was something rotten in the
state of Denmark. Close the gates.

466
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:54,429
Come on guys, we've got to
get that cleaning lady.

467
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,989
Move it!
She can't get away.

468
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,460
Psst!

469
00:49:52,679 --> 00:49:54,639
Shit! It's the cleaning lady.

470
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,489
Okay, okay. We'll start preparing dinner.

471
00:50:20,039 --> 00:50:22,849
Imagine that, you're not even
allowed to go to the bathroom.

472
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,769
I've got her.

473
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,260
She doesn't have it!

474
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:02,719
Have you examined her?

475
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,170
There?

476
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:07,860
And there?

477
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,090
And there?

478
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,260
I've been there...

479
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:20,690
Where is the microfilm?

480
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,829
Kokonono.

481
00:51:24,679 --> 00:51:27,070
Boss, the Sheik of Obec has arrived.

482
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:30,159
Shit...

483
00:51:38,199 --> 00:51:40,969
I thought we'd have the film
by the time the Sheik arrived.

484
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:43,519
Not a word to the Sheik!

485
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,650
- How?
- How? I don't know. Come up with something.

486
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:49,909
Tell him you don't do
business before sunset.

487
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:08,670
Welcome to Bromberg, your highness.
I hope your trip was a pleasant one.

488
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:12,929
Microfilm?

489
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,949
In this country we don't
do business before supper.

490
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,630
Yes, It'll take a while.

491
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:28,059
Getting fresh camel balls
wasn't easy you know.

492
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,090
Should camel balls be cooked, boiled, fried
or coated with egg and breadcrumbs?

493
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:39,050
Camel balls should be roasted
on an open fire...

494
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:42,250
There should at least be
something nipping at your nose.

495
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,789
We have to find that film at all costs.

496
00:53:06,039 --> 00:53:07,369
Where the fuck have you been?

497
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,789
It's not easy hitchhiking these days.

498
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:14,489
Yes, dressed like that
I'm amazed you even got here.

499
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:19,039
Brge, show her to the Sheik,
to distract him for a while.

500
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,110
While you're looking for that damned film.

501
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:24,989
And now, let's use all means necessary.

502
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:43,860
Alone at last, lovely colleague.
We are colleagues right?

503
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:48,869
Do you mind if I search you?

504
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,030
Absolutely not.

505
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,760
Okay, my strong, well equipped man...
Do you have the film?

506
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:02,679
Perhaps I do.

507
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:06,730
- Did you hide it here?
- Perhaps I did...

508
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,389
If this is film, it's not a micro...
It's a mammothfilm.

509
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,599
"Que diriez-vous de
patisserie, mon seigneur"

510
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:39,960
You see. Good, right?

511
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:52,780
Oui' Oui.

512
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,250
Excuse me.

513
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,760
Now I know why you Arabs
have more than one wife.

514
00:55:19,239 --> 00:55:22,190
You need four just to hold up the tent.

515
00:55:26,679 --> 00:55:29,030
- He doesn't have the microfilm.
- Shit!

516
00:55:40,119 --> 00:55:41,420
Hands up!

517
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,809
You're not even
allowed to go shopping.

518
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:48,449
Invitation?
No, but I can prove to you who I am.

519
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,230
- Am I interrupting?
- No No.

520
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,690
Give me a helping hand here.

521
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:35,730
I like you.
As long as you trust me.

522
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,400
We could do things
together, you and I.

523
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:05,550
- So, what do you say?
- Aren't there too many people here?

524
00:57:06,199 --> 00:57:07,500
Get lost!

525
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:10,900
Now I'm going to show you
my secret agent skills.

526
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:16,059
- Someone is coming.
- The veil.

527
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,719
It's Jensen!

528
00:57:23,559 --> 00:57:25,489
What are you doing here?

529
00:57:26,119 --> 00:57:29,449
Don't you recognize me from
the firm, little Jensen?

530
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:33,280
Irma la Douche.

531
00:57:36,639 --> 00:57:39,449
- What the fuck are you doing here!
- They've taken Penny.

532
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:42,039
Okay, trust me.

533
00:57:42,519 --> 00:57:44,059
Someone is coming.

534
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:57,440
Oh shit!!

535
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,949
More are coming.

536
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,619
What the fuck is going on?

537
00:58:15,079 --> 00:58:19,219
- Do you want to taste some?
- No, I don't like Arab food.

538
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,739
Get me out of here.

539
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:43,050
There isn't anyone in the kitchen.

540
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:46,570
Help me with the goddamned film!

541
01:00:49,639 --> 01:00:52,130
I think you could use all of it.

542
01:00:52,679 --> 01:00:54,780
Great.

543
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,769
We need some pepper too.

544
01:02:38,239 --> 01:02:41,289
I want the fucking film!
Where the hell is it!

545
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,780
Search the house,
turn it upside down!

546
01:03:40,199 --> 01:03:42,449
- You like me don't you.
- Yes.

547
01:03:47,239 --> 01:03:48,750
Yes, I can feel that you do...

548
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:47,510
Find the fucking film!

549
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,579
FIND IT!

550
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:46,489
Well, I have to go. It doesn't seem
that you had the film anyway.

551
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,210
- Yes?
- No.

552
01:06:51,079 --> 01:06:53,219
- But I got clean.
- So take the next guy then!

553
01:06:53,719 --> 01:06:56,599
No, please. I had to screw
Horsepower more than twice

554
01:06:57,199 --> 01:06:59,760
before he told me he
didn't have the film.

555
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:02,530
Go to work!

556
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:06,159
What are you looking at?
Go help her out!

557
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,170
Damn microfilm!

558
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:16,210
Add some curry.

559
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,889
Easy.

560
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,710
Matty, we have them down here.

561
01:08:01,159 --> 01:08:02,809
All right, we're coming.

562
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,239
The film?

563
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:13,300
Who has the microfilm?

564
01:08:57,119 --> 01:08:58,310
Excuse me.

565
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:18,859
Mother!

566
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,449
Come on!

567
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:42,779
As long as I don't get a fever,
and become sick.

568
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:45,510
What would mother and grandmother say?

569
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,770
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- He doesn't have the film.

570
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:51,460
So, help me out!

571
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,069
Where can that film be?

572
01:10:40,359 --> 01:10:42,640
- Are you sure nobody has it?
- Yes.

573
01:10:43,159 --> 01:10:45,859
We have to find it, even if we have
to tear the entire building down.

574
01:10:46,439 --> 01:10:49,420
- What about the Sheik?
- Operation Kadang?

575
01:10:50,039 --> 01:10:51,789
Matty, you're a hero.

576
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:16,060
Your welcome.

577
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:28,039
I got that.

578
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:30,859
Goat milk?

579
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:34,250
Perhaps one should become a Muslim?

580
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:44,729
Matty?

581
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:05,680
You've got a nice car.
Do you drive yourself?

582
01:12:06,319 --> 01:12:10,670
Driving older cars, you really have
to have a knack for acceleration.

583
01:12:11,479 --> 01:12:15,800
Most cars have a pretty rough
gear stick, with five gears.

584
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:20,850
You really have to know how to
work the gear stick right.

585
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:25,329
Working the stick gives the best
results in the end, don't you think?

586
01:12:26,039 --> 01:12:27,829
It all depends on whether the car is

587
01:12:28,279 --> 01:12:30,739
new or driven before.

588
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:32,579
Driven before?

589
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:38,109
Yes, if you've driven it before, you know how
it feels, and you'll know how to work it.

590
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:42,310
Yes sure, you know how to work it.

591
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:48,439
That's the point isn't it? If you've been
there before, you know how good it feels.

592
01:12:49,319 --> 01:12:53,569
It feels good in the end. It's a smooth, and
silent ride that really pays off in the end.

593
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:58,449
- Brge!
- Sorry boss.

594
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:01,869
- It's in progress.
- It was something else.

595
01:13:03,439 --> 01:13:06,699
I'm very fascinated by the
technology behind the car engine.

596
01:13:07,359 --> 01:13:09,710
Oh, the combustion engine.

597
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:13,680
With enough friction there is enough
heat in one or more cylinders.

598
01:13:14,359 --> 01:13:16,289
The more cylinders, the more action.

599
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:20,729
Finally, the engine is so
ready it just explodes.

600
01:13:21,479 --> 01:13:22,949
Cheers.

601
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:24,909
Yes, cheers.

602
01:13:33,319 --> 01:13:35,319
The tip is the most sensitive
part of the stick.

603
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:38,750
Therefore, the engine has to
have a very prominent cooler.

604
01:13:39,359 --> 01:13:42,060
The most useful is the air conditioning.

605
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,689
... and water cooler.

606
01:13:57,319 --> 01:13:58,899
Couscous.

607
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:02,130
Yes, yes yes yes

608
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:05,819
Come on.

609
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:08,829
Mother!

610
01:14:09,159 --> 01:14:12,739
... Arabic food.
Taste it, young man.

611
01:14:13,439 --> 01:14:15,649
- What is happening?
- Nothing.

612
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:17,880
It's an Arabic tradition-

613
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:22,010
that the youngest man at the table takes the first bite.

614
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:24,260
Weird tradition.

615
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:28,010
Young people have strong stomachs

616
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:30,539
and if they can't eat the food-

617
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,279
nobody else can either.

618
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:54,569
Oui, oui.

619
01:15:01,319 --> 01:15:04,020
I thought I just got one.

620
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:09,300
Jesus.

621
01:15:15,319 --> 01:15:17,140
It's not just any dish.

622
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:18,680
What's it made of?

623
01:15:19,039 --> 01:15:20,970
It's an old Arabic recipe

624
01:15:21,439 --> 01:15:24,670
my mother got from an Irish tobacconist.

625
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:29,010
- What's in it?
- You'd rather not know.

626
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:30,979
Thanks.

627
01:15:35,319 --> 01:15:36,859
Something wrong?

628
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:50,390
Here. Help yourself.

629
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,789
Cheers.

630
01:16:43,079 --> 01:16:46,100
You're served well here.

631
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:50,699
And the servants are charming.

632
01:16:52,199 --> 01:16:54,760
Oh, sorry.

633
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:58,649
- It's just that... JENSEN!
- Just grab me.

634
01:16:59,319 --> 01:17:01,810
There are a few things you can't ask of me.

635
01:17:02,359 --> 01:17:04,569
This place has been seized by the Scorpio!

636
01:17:05,079 --> 01:17:07,010
You catch on quick.

637
01:17:07,479 --> 01:17:10,319
- He's going to steal the microfilm.
- Yes, I know, but where the hell is it?

638
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:14,149
You like my Harem?

639
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,689
It's a nice costume Jensen.

640
01:17:17,159 --> 01:17:19,899
It becomes you.

641
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:25,119
Do you want to sit down?
There's a plate here for you.

642
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,140
Weird stuffing they have in the bread.

643
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:47,680
The microfilm!

644
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:09,680
Catch her!

645
01:18:12,439 --> 01:18:13,449
Stop it!

646
01:18:22,279 --> 01:18:23,329
Where are you all going?

647
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,350
Stop it!

648
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,439
Make love, not war.

649
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:51,760
What's all the noise?

650
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:10,409
Can't we just sit down and talk about it?

651
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:14,140
We are all grown-ups.

652
01:19:19,279 --> 01:19:20,720
Did you just hit me?

653
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:25,819
Here you go.

654
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:30,979
- Are there any more?
- Arnold knows his ways.

655
01:19:36,279 --> 01:19:37,119
Sorry.

656
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:55,460
After them!

657
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:04,159
It came so suddenly.

658
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:08,239
Get in. Get ready for the payback.

659
01:20:59,079 --> 01:20:59,989
Assholes!

660
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,869
The gas pedal is stuck to the floor.

661
01:22:04,279 --> 01:22:05,470
Where the fuck is the gate?

662
01:22:27,479 --> 01:22:28,880
Shit!

663
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:32,029
Try City Hall.

664
01:22:34,039 --> 01:22:36,810
As the town's mayor, you have asked me

665
01:22:37,399 --> 01:22:41,229
to perform this marriage...

666
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,560
Can't you see there's a
wedding going on here?

667
01:22:47,039 --> 01:22:50,619
Don't you know it's a crime
"against passion" to interrupt a wedding?

668
01:22:52,319 --> 01:22:53,510
Yes...

669
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:56,270
As the town's mayor,
you have asked me

670
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,869
to perform this marriage...

671
01:23:01,319 --> 01:23:02,689
Hello.

672
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:11,760
Do you, Didrik Hansen
and Katrine Jorginsen-

673
01:23:12,399 --> 01:23:15,949
wish to enter into holy matrimony?

674
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:18,640
If so, I ask you, Didrik Hansen,

675
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:21,539
do you take Katrine Jorginsen
to be your beloved wife?

676
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:24,289
- Yes.
- She twists his arm!

677
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:28,699
If you can't keep your voice
down I'm calling the police.

678
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:37,449
Do you Katrine Jorginsen, take Didrik
Hansen to be your beloved husband?

679
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:47,960
Get away!

680
01:23:49,079 --> 01:23:52,590
And look back upon this day

681
01:23:53,279 --> 01:23:56,539
as the most important day of your lives...

682
01:23:58,840 --> 01:23:59,609
Blood revenge!

683
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:01,319
What is going on?

684
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:03,260
Hands up!

685
01:24:06,119 --> 01:24:07,590
Give me the microfilm!

686
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:10,960
Hands down!

687
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:15,470
Great mother!

688
01:24:19,039 --> 01:24:21,949
- You're getting married, Mr. Jensen?
- I can explain everything.

689
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,699
- Almost everything.
- I sure hope so.

690
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:29,050
Now, give me the film.

691
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:31,750
Thanks... Jensen.

692
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,939
Keep going mayor.

693
01:24:36,439 --> 01:24:38,760
- Is it always like this?
- No.

694
01:24:39,279 --> 01:24:40,750
You can have the damned thing.

695
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:42,880
Make love, not war.

696
01:24:45,039 --> 01:24:48,449
Bio-dynamic potatoes and
unbleached flour.

697
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:52,899
Are you in need of a young healthy
man who knows health food and yoga?

698
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,520
"Ropy milk and thick yoghurt... "
Who the hell are you?

699
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,050
I asked them to come here
to pick up the reward

700
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:00,909
as a token of our gratitude.

701
01:25:01,279 --> 01:25:05,670
Thanks to you, professor Neubau's
formula came into the right hands.

702
01:25:06,479 --> 01:25:07,560
- You're welcome.
- Thanks.

703
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:09,989
- What about me?
- You, you just did your job.

704
01:25:10,479 --> 01:25:13,390
- Should we celebrate with carrot juice?
- I prefer goat milk.

705
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,899
That's right my boy, it's good for the... talent!

706
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:20,569
You're right.

707
01:25:21,560 --> 01:25:24,329
Do we have something new coming up,
where we'd use the double trousers trick?

708
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:28,079
- That's my trousers.
- I know everything about you and my wife.

709
01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:32,449
The ladies, Jensen. The ladies.
