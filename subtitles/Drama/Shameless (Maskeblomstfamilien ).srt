Back at the house now,

you need something from me,

maybe I need something
from you.

I would like to be shown

the respect which I deserve.

of the basic...

954
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,796
- Would you give me a Valium?
- No, I only have one.

955
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:16,833
And it's my safety net in case
my hypnotherapy doesn't work.

956
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:19,735
Hypnotherapy is just paying
to nap in someone's office.

957
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:21,270
Give me a pill.

958
00:47:21,304 --> 00:47:23,238
It's gonna show up
in your urine test.

959
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:25,341
- Give me the goddamn pill.
- What's the matter with you?

960
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:26,842
What this does is it
puts the responsibility

961
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:29,111
- right on the child.
- Okay. Come on.

962
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:30,946
Your job as parents
is to define the rules...

963
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,581
- Here. Christ.
- And then lay out

964
00:47:32,615 --> 00:47:34,349
the consequences
that will follow

965
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:36,585
when those rules are broken.

966
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:38,587
Now the child breaking the rules
is then responsible

967
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:40,823
for his or her
own consequences.

968
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:43,759
And this method actually
leads to empowerment

969
00:47:43,793 --> 00:47:47,129
and helps him or her feel more
in control of their own lives.

970
00:47:47,163 --> 00:47:49,999
How is she still ovulating?
What is she, part bovine?

971
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:52,702
- Shh. Focus on me.
- Mm.

972
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:55,704
Yeah, now you're gonna pretend
like you're in high school

973
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:57,940
and you're gonna come quickly
like a rabbit, okay?

974
00:47:57,975 --> 00:47:59,842
- Ooh, yeah.
- No, not that quick.

975

You gotta shoehorn
or something?

Just don't say a word.

Are you crying?
Oh, God, she's crying.

00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:28,471
Please don't cry.
I'm sorry, okay?

984
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:30,806
I'm sorry, mama.
Hey, hey, hey.

985
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:32,641
Okay! That's it!

986

We're gonna do this shit
and we're gonna be done with it.

Mama, wipe your
tears and focus!

We need to give those little

I'm Monica.
What's your name?

1004
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:27,030
Frank, wasn't the last time
I had to pee in a cup

1005
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:29,866
when I was pregnant with Liam?

1006

Remember that?
It was just like yesterday, huh?

Oh.

1008

Uh, sorry, the shower
ran out of hot water.

Mama, you want Kevin
to take you home?

Well, he can't drive
with that leg.

1011
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:35,104
No, but he can get
you home in a taxi.

1012
00:50:35,138 --> 00:50:37,440
It's the least we can do.

Well, let me get my bag.

- Any work at the salon?
- Uh, not right now, baby.

What was she doing here
so early?

She slept over
after she and Kevin had sex.

What?

1022

Mama's the best surrogate
we got.

1023

Turkey baster didn't work

1024

so we had to do it
the old-fashioned way.
