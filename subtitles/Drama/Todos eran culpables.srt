1
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:15,084
When the hive doesn't work,
they say you have to change the queen.

2
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,541
But what about us?

3
00:01:18,926 --> 00:01:21,464
What are we supposed to change?

4
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,422
There she is. There she is.

5
00:01:52,923 --> 00:01:55,545
There's the queen. Grab her.

6
00:02:01,934 --> 00:02:05,386
-Should I kill her?
-Yeah, kill her.

7
00:02:05,605 --> 00:02:07,681
Poor thing.

8
00:02:09,317 --> 00:02:12,769
If the hive doesn't get stronger,
others will come take the honey again.

9
00:02:12,988 --> 00:02:15,028
Will the new queen
breed more worker bees?

10
00:02:15,242 --> 00:02:16,440
She should.

11
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,330
Let's hope she's a good one.
Give her to me.

12
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:23,876
Here.

13
00:02:24,794 --> 00:02:26,170
There.

14
00:02:38,394 --> 00:02:41,845
Here, let me do it.

15
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:14,291
Amadeo.

16
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,831
-What do you need?
-Rope.

17
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:20,928
Mooring line?

18
00:04:21,137 --> 00:04:22,300
That one will do.

19
00:04:22,514 --> 00:04:24,222
Give me five meters.

20
00:04:29,064 --> 00:04:31,022
Your kids left for the day?

21
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:33,227
Yes.

22
00:04:36,156 --> 00:04:37,734
Business doing well, right?

23
00:04:39,952 --> 00:04:41,576
I can't complain.

24
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,160
A new boat....

25
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,178
What else do you need?

26
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,344
Packing tape.

27
00:05:29,551 --> 00:05:32,422
These are for the East Canal, right?

28
00:05:32,638 --> 00:05:33,800
Yeah.

29
00:05:34,014 --> 00:05:35,722
I'll take them.

30
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:38,555
Not going to the El Dorado today?

31
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,475
No, it's Monday. My day off. Why?

32
00:05:42,524 --> 00:05:44,232
No reason.

33
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:54,328
Here.

34
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,122
I'll give you the rest later.

35
00:06:00,712 --> 00:06:03,381
Rosa, I didn't clean the other crate.
Could you do it?

36
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,835
Okay.

37
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:07,593
Lock up after.

38
00:06:12,517 --> 00:06:14,925
And in the middle
of all that darkness, faith.

39
00:06:16,021 --> 00:06:18,097
He who wants to save his life...

40
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:19,726
...will lose it...

41
00:06:19,942 --> 00:06:22,434
...but he who is willing
to lose it for me...

42
00:06:22,654 --> 00:06:25,406
...will be saved.

43
00:06:26,617 --> 00:06:29,986
When? When will it happen?

44
00:06:31,748 --> 00:06:34,785
That's for the Lord to decide.
We can't perceive that.

45
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:39,912
The only thing I perceive
is you shorted me 30 pesos.

46
00:06:41,343 --> 00:06:44,297
Can't you wait for payday
like everyone else?

47
00:06:47,183 --> 00:06:49,675
I already did my part of the job.

48
00:06:51,271 --> 00:06:53,597
On payday I'll be somewhere else.

49
00:06:57,362 --> 00:07:00,897
-What, are you going shopping?
-Something like that.

50
00:07:03,952 --> 00:07:06,989
Taking Baby for a walk?

51
00:07:07,206 --> 00:07:08,487
Don't call her that.

52
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,997
Now that you're her boss....

53
00:07:21,806 --> 00:07:23,135
Did she talk about me?

54
00:07:25,561 --> 00:07:27,470
What did she say?

55
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,565
What did she say?

56
00:07:31,901 --> 00:07:33,147
Well?

57
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:39,494
Nothing, she didn't say a word.

58
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:43,867
As if she were a saint....

59
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:04,978
That moron probably got lost.

60
00:08:06,233 --> 00:08:09,020
Bet you a grand
he's here in 10 minutes.

61
00:08:09,737 --> 00:08:11,362
Okay.

62
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:23,074
Why'd you let your godson
bring the guy by himself?

63
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:29,299
I can't be seen dragging the old man
from the El Dorado.

64
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:33,090
I know the kid's just starting, but...

65
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:36,141
...if he wants to learn
he's gotta work.

66
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,019
Of course, you're the boss....

67
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:45,644
I'm his godfather, that's all.

68
00:08:50,827 --> 00:08:52,867
-There he is.
-Told you so.

69
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:14,056
Rubén, you stupid motherfucker!

70
00:09:14,271 --> 00:09:15,813
You owe me a grand.

71
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:17,932
How can you be such an idiot?

72
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,182
What happened?

73
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,145
What happened is I'm gonna beat
the shit out of you!

74
00:09:24,449 --> 00:09:26,691
You can't even put
a blindfold on right!

75
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:32,532
You're pathetic! You don't even
deserve a beating. Asshole!

76
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:36,787
Should I pull him out?

77
00:09:37,631 --> 00:09:39,707
Adrián, nobody saw me, I swear.

78
00:10:40,996 --> 00:10:45,160
EVERYBODY HAS A PLAN

79
00:11:26,049 --> 00:11:27,841
Strong heartbeat!

80
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,644
You can sit up now.

81
00:11:44,112 --> 00:11:46,151
You're a good girl.

82
00:12:01,632 --> 00:12:03,708
If the temperature goes back up,
call me.

83
00:12:03,926 --> 00:12:06,002
I didn't think you'd make it.

84
00:12:08,264 --> 00:12:09,807
Bye.

85
00:12:10,017 --> 00:12:12,934
-Sorry I'm late.
-Here, use this.

86
00:12:16,232 --> 00:12:18,521
-Have you seen him?
-No, not yet.

87
00:12:20,612 --> 00:12:25,073
-What are you doing after?
-I have to go back to the clinic.

88
00:12:26,536 --> 00:12:27,781
There he is.

89
00:12:30,707 --> 00:12:32,367
-Hello.
-Hi.

90
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,037
Look.

91
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,169
Here, hold this for me.

92
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,336
Careful.

93
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,548
There you go.

94
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,591
Hi there!

95
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,770
-Is all the paperwork done?
-Yes.

96
00:12:48,978 --> 00:12:51,351
No, we're missing the lab results.

97
00:12:51,565 --> 00:12:54,934
-That's what we're missing.
-Yeah.

98
00:12:55,152 --> 00:12:57,394
I'm going to Mendoza this week...

99
00:12:57,613 --> 00:12:59,405
...for a book signing.

100
00:13:00,241 --> 00:13:02,364
-I'll bring them when I get back.
-Okay.

101
00:13:02,577 --> 00:13:07,158
I know we still have to wait,
but we're almost there.

102
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:09,659
We're almost there!

103
00:13:10,337 --> 00:13:12,247
I have to take him back now.

104
00:13:12,465 --> 00:13:16,166
Listen, don't tell anyone
I let you see him, they'll kill me.

105
00:13:16,386 --> 00:13:18,011
Sure, don't worry.

106
00:13:18,221 --> 00:13:20,214
Okay, let's go.

107
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,556
Careful with his head. There.

108
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:24,429
-I'll call you.
-Thanks a lot.

109
00:13:24,645 --> 00:13:26,437
-Thank you.
-Bye, bye.

110
00:14:53,748 --> 00:14:55,492
Hi.

111
00:14:55,876 --> 00:14:57,750
What are you doing up?

112
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:00,668
-I couldn't sleep.
-No?

113
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,628
No.

114
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:14,766
The party was nice.
Too bad you didn't come.

115
00:15:25,536 --> 00:15:27,576
Did you see
how tiny his fingers were?

116
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,005
Yeah.

117
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:43,763
Coming?

118
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:47,303
I'll be right there.

119
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,478
So then they blindfolded us...

120
00:15:57,406 --> 00:15:59,779
...like it was a game...

121
00:16:01,286 --> 00:16:03,956
...and asked us to rank the wines...

122
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:08,827
...from the most expensive
to the cheapest.

123
00:16:09,837 --> 00:16:14,050
Then they took off the blindfolds
and told us the prices. It was silly.

124
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:18,175
We got back to the hotel
at 3 in the morning...

125
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:21,307
...and I couldn't sleep on the plane,
don't know why.

126
00:16:21,518 --> 00:16:24,091
I'm exhausted.

127
00:16:25,731 --> 00:16:26,762
I was thinking...

128
00:16:26,982 --> 00:16:30,482
...when the baby comes
we'll need to hire someone to help.

129
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,654
Don't forget to leave me
the lab results.

130
00:16:34,866 --> 00:16:37,488
I'm going to the hospital
early tomorrow.

131
00:16:38,704 --> 00:16:40,863
No, no...

132
00:16:41,082 --> 00:16:43,205
...I didn't pick them up.

133
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,749
Why, you didn't have time?

134
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,383
Why didn't you go?

135
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:58,175
Because I don't want us
to adopt the baby.

136
00:17:00,813 --> 00:17:04,313
I thought about it and I don't want
to adopt that baby.

137
00:17:04,526 --> 00:17:06,483
Or any baby, for that matter.

138
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:10,778
I have nothing to offer him.
I'm not cut out to be a father.

139
00:17:12,577 --> 00:17:15,115
Besides, I quit my teaching job so....

140
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,702
What does that have
to do with anything?

141
00:17:21,712 --> 00:17:25,332
Is there something wrong with you?
Something you haven't told me about?

142
00:17:31,308 --> 00:17:34,344
Look, if you don't want to adopt
the baby, I'll do it alone.

143
00:17:34,561 --> 00:17:36,139
You know?

144
00:17:42,654 --> 00:17:44,943
Yes, I think that would be
for the best.

145
00:17:54,084 --> 00:17:55,911
How can you do this to me?

146
00:17:56,128 --> 00:17:57,409
How can you?

147
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,421
You know what that baby
means to me!

148
00:17:59,632 --> 00:18:03,713
If you didn't want to adopt him,
why'd you make me take all those tests?

149
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:05,589
Why?

150
00:18:09,477 --> 00:18:12,561
Speak! Say something!

151
00:18:14,274 --> 00:18:16,183
I didn't make you do anything, Claudia.

152
00:18:21,657 --> 00:18:24,410
No, no, where are you going?
Where are you going?

153
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:29,163
You're a selfish son of a bitch!
You sick fuck!

154
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,619
You're gonna lock yourself
in there again?

155
00:18:36,174 --> 00:18:38,001
Open up!

156
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:42,003
Open up, don't be a coward!

157
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:07,039
Your office called.

158
00:19:07,252 --> 00:19:09,790
I told them you still had the flu.

159
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:13,211
They want to know
what to do with your shift.

160
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:18,798
Agustín!

161
00:19:19,015 --> 00:19:22,551
Come out. We have to talk.
Please, this is absurd.

162
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:28,268
Are you going to stay in there
the rest of your life?

163
00:19:52,138 --> 00:19:54,808
Hi, I'm looking for Agustín Souto.

164
00:19:55,016 --> 00:19:57,389
This is his brother Pedro.

165
00:19:58,353 --> 00:20:01,889
They gave me this number
at the clinic.

166
00:20:02,108 --> 00:20:05,394
Anyway, I don't know....

167
00:20:06,988 --> 00:20:08,862
I'll call again later.

168
00:20:31,976 --> 00:20:34,301
I'm going to Rosario.

169
00:20:35,438 --> 00:20:37,846
When I get back,
I'll stay at my sister's.

170
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:44,228
I've been thinking, and I'm going
to put the apartment up for sale.

171
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:53,282
Agustín, you know you're not well.
You need to get help.

172
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:04,415
Another Kidnapping in Tigre

173
00:22:32,866 --> 00:22:33,898
Hi.

174
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,858
What's up, asshole?

175
00:22:47,008 --> 00:22:48,799
What's with the beard?

176
00:22:53,766 --> 00:22:55,640
Guess I'll have to shave mine, then.

177
00:23:04,027 --> 00:23:07,693
What the hell happened?
Maid didn't show up?

178
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:11,948
Nice place. Yours?

179
00:23:12,162 --> 00:23:13,537
My wife's.

180
00:23:17,543 --> 00:23:19,203
Been together long?

181
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,579
Eight years.

182
00:23:22,257 --> 00:23:23,917
She's away.

183
00:23:30,975 --> 00:23:33,301
I brought you a present.

184
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:42,195
It's from my hive.

185
00:23:42,405 --> 00:23:44,896
I make it. You'll like it.

186
00:23:45,409 --> 00:23:49,656
-You're living on the island?
-Yeah, for a while now.

187
00:23:50,623 --> 00:23:52,249
I had no idea.

188
00:24:01,553 --> 00:24:03,842
I stayed with Adrián for a while...

189
00:24:04,056 --> 00:24:07,093
...until I bought back
Grandpa's house.

190
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,059
-Still hanging out with Adrián?
-Yeah.

191
00:24:11,356 --> 00:24:12,851
You should see him.

192
00:24:13,525 --> 00:24:15,103
He's changed a lot.

193
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:18,193
He went religious on us.

194
00:24:19,741 --> 00:24:21,116
Cheers.

195
00:24:34,091 --> 00:24:35,669
What are you looking for?

196
00:24:40,181 --> 00:24:43,136
-What are you looking for?
-Wanna make spaghetti?

197
00:24:50,318 --> 00:24:51,481
Leave it, I'll do it.

198
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:16,632
So that son of a bitch
is still on the island.

199
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,303
Adrián? Where else would he go?

200
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,474
And he keeps gambling
and losing like an asshole.

201
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,480
He owes me a grand.

202
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,820
When Mom got sick
I looked for you everywhere.

203
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:36,946
-I left you several messages at....
-Yeah, I got them.

204
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,578
So why didn't you come?

205
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,077
I guess I couldn't make it.

206
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:46,534
I don't get it.

207
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:50,333
You came to Dad's funeral.
What about Mom?

208
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,926
We had her here, bedridden,
for a year and a half.

209
00:25:55,971 --> 00:26:00,384
She couldn't recognize anyone
at the end. She'd get violent.

210
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:03,262
And you know what?

211
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,564
All she did was ask about you.

212
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:21,865
What does your wife do?

213
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:24,489
Why are you here?

214
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:37,759
I have cancer.

215
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:40,306
I've had it for a while.

216
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:45,972
Have you seen a doctor?

217
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:58,985
I'm having a rough time, you know?

218
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:09,745
I need your help.

219
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:27,093
Or you could get me a prescription.
I don't know.

220
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,686
I can't do it alone.

221
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,396
Been a long time
since I asked you for anything.

222
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:41,607
Maybe it would be better
to do it on the island.

223
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:45,446
Nobody asks questions there,
they're very discreet.

224
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:53,380
Aside from the moral compensation,
there's money. 70,000 pesos.

225
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,381
They'll leave it in the beehive...

226
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:57,134
...behind my house.

227
00:27:58,136 --> 00:28:01,303
You'll find a package
stuck under one of the hive lids.

228
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:04,385
That's if they pay me, of course.

229
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:10,976
Well?

230
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,734
What do you say?

231
00:28:21,202 --> 00:28:24,617
I didn't know beekeeping
was so profitable.

232
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:19,084
This book is mine, isn't it?

233
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:22,877
No.

234
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:26,008
-No?
-No.

235
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:35,229
It's a shitty novel anyway.

236
00:29:37,111 --> 00:29:39,566
Guess whose boat I bought.

237
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:44,108
Old man Rapaport's?

238
00:29:46,036 --> 00:29:47,317
The very same.

239
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:49,200
No kidding!

240
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:53,123
That was a nice boat.

241
00:29:53,794 --> 00:29:56,463
Remember when we stole it
to go to Carmelo?

242
00:29:58,841 --> 00:30:02,625
-When we got back, he wanted to kill us.
-Yeah.

243
00:30:05,139 --> 00:30:06,716
Rapaport....

244
00:30:07,725 --> 00:30:09,682
He was a legend.

245
00:30:11,687 --> 00:30:13,062
Amazing he's still alive.

246
00:30:13,272 --> 00:30:17,352
No, he died a year and a half ago.

247
00:30:17,568 --> 00:30:19,192
Cancer too.

248
00:30:32,626 --> 00:30:34,203
I put a Mercury on it.

249
00:30:35,253 --> 00:30:37,744
A 25-horse. Basic.

250
00:30:45,805 --> 00:30:46,837
Anyway....

251
00:30:47,682 --> 00:30:50,173
Pass me a towel, would you?

252
00:31:02,364 --> 00:31:03,941
What are you doing, asshole?

253
00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:24,883
I'll call for help.

254
00:31:25,095 --> 00:31:27,301
No. No!

255
00:34:21,939 --> 00:34:23,267
Look, Dad.

256
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,564
Pedro!

257
00:35:58,036 --> 00:35:59,115
Excuse me.

258
00:38:11,921 --> 00:38:13,960
The Refuge

259
00:42:55,456 --> 00:42:56,701
Hello.

260
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,077
Hello.

261
00:43:09,929 --> 00:43:11,471
How's it going?

262
00:43:12,806 --> 00:43:14,087
Fine.

263
00:43:20,649 --> 00:43:22,143
Tea and....

264
00:43:23,109 --> 00:43:26,313
-And yerba mate?
-Yerba? Sure.

265
00:43:29,115 --> 00:43:30,693
This one, right?

266
00:43:31,868 --> 00:43:33,113
Yeah.

267
00:43:33,328 --> 00:43:34,407
Yeah.

268
00:43:34,621 --> 00:43:38,072
And a box of matches, please.

269
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,122
If you hear anything let us know.

270
00:43:55,725 --> 00:43:57,718
That'll do it. What do I owe you?

271
00:43:57,936 --> 00:43:59,560
What's up, Pedro?

272
00:44:02,315 --> 00:44:03,347
How are you?

273
00:44:03,567 --> 00:44:05,440
Fine, I guess.

274
00:44:07,529 --> 00:44:08,774
19.50.

275
00:44:17,706 --> 00:44:20,541
-Can you change this?
-Yes.

276
00:44:25,797 --> 00:44:29,795
Tell me, have you by any chance seen...

277
00:44:30,051 --> 00:44:32,625
...your friend Adrián Ortiz?

278
00:44:33,722 --> 00:44:35,465
No.

279
00:44:36,558 --> 00:44:38,135
The thing is...

280
00:44:38,977 --> 00:44:41,550
...you can't trust anybody anymore.

281
00:44:42,939 --> 00:44:44,896
Everyone knows each other
around here.

282
00:44:45,108 --> 00:44:48,477
If you hang out with that guy
you must be a piece of shit too.

283
00:44:48,695 --> 00:44:50,688
So you haven't heard
from that bastard?

284
00:44:52,115 --> 00:44:53,574
No.

285
00:44:53,867 --> 00:44:55,326
No.

286
00:44:56,536 --> 00:44:58,244
Well....

287
00:44:59,873 --> 00:45:02,993
If you do hear from him,
we'd like to know.

288
00:45:03,209 --> 00:45:07,587
And if you don't want to cooperate,
out of respect...

289
00:45:07,797 --> 00:45:10,467
...until my father's case is solved...

290
00:45:10,717 --> 00:45:13,718
...don't show your face around here.
You got it?

291
00:45:13,928 --> 00:45:15,921
Okay, fine.

292
00:45:20,977 --> 00:45:23,931
Don't bring your honey anymore.
We don't want it.

293
00:45:36,243 --> 00:45:38,865
-You're letting him go?
-What do you want me to do?

294
00:45:42,917 --> 00:45:45,622
You've got nothing to say?
You're full of shit!

295
00:45:45,836 --> 00:45:47,580
-Stop it!
-Why'd you kill my father?

296
00:45:47,797 --> 00:45:49,421
Let me go!

297
00:45:49,632 --> 00:45:51,375
Leave him alone!

298
00:45:51,676 --> 00:45:53,752
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

299
00:45:53,969 --> 00:45:55,761
Get out! Get out of here!

300
00:45:55,971 --> 00:45:57,549
Get out, you hear me?

301
00:45:59,975 --> 00:46:02,513
Get back. Wait a minute!

302
00:46:07,358 --> 00:46:09,765
Tell your friend we know it was him...

303
00:46:09,944 --> 00:46:12,731
...and even if we can't prove it
we'll be waiting for him.

304
00:46:16,367 --> 00:46:18,525
Get out, you piece of shit.

305
00:46:18,744 --> 00:46:20,155
That's enough!

306
00:47:15,843 --> 00:47:17,752
Anybody home?

307
00:47:20,848 --> 00:47:23,256
I came to see how you're doing.

308
00:47:24,894 --> 00:47:27,645
I brought your things.

309
00:47:31,108 --> 00:47:32,852
Thanks.

310
00:47:33,569 --> 00:47:35,028
Did you put ice on it?

311
00:47:35,237 --> 00:47:36,897
Yeah.

312
00:47:37,573 --> 00:47:39,531
No, it's fine.

313
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:00,961
Why did you go to the El Dorado?

314
00:48:03,767 --> 00:48:05,261
I don't know.

315
00:48:14,152 --> 00:48:17,735
-Did they sting you?
-A little.

316
00:48:18,824 --> 00:48:20,816
Don't. I can do it.

317
00:48:31,253 --> 00:48:34,787
We need to buy more beeswax.
We're running low.

318
00:48:35,006 --> 00:48:36,666
I can go get it if you want.

319
00:48:36,883 --> 00:48:38,543
Okay.

320
00:48:41,012 --> 00:48:42,804
Sure you'll be okay?

321
00:48:43,223 --> 00:48:45,381
Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

322
00:48:47,352 --> 00:48:48,977
Bye.

323
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:21,109
FOR SALE

324
00:50:40,174 --> 00:50:41,965
Is that the window facing the street?

325
00:50:42,176 --> 00:50:43,670
Yes.

326
00:50:51,852 --> 00:50:53,133
Hello?

327
00:52:32,996 --> 00:52:35,119
Agustín!

328
00:52:35,332 --> 00:52:37,620
Agustín!

329
00:52:37,834 --> 00:52:39,032
Here, this tree will do.

330
00:52:39,252 --> 00:52:40,711
Stop. What are you doing?

331
00:52:40,921 --> 00:52:45,084
You sit here, we'll take this rope
and tie you up.

332
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:48,467
-Let's go, Pedro. Leave him here.
-We'll be back later, Agustín.

333
00:52:48,678 --> 00:52:50,885
-You're gonna leave me here?
-Don't be a baby.

334
00:52:51,097 --> 00:52:53,090
Come back, Adrián!

335
00:52:53,308 --> 00:52:55,431
-Don't leave me here alone!
-Bye, Agustín.

336
00:52:55,644 --> 00:52:57,304
Chickenshit!

337
00:52:57,521 --> 00:52:59,063
See you, chicken.

338
00:53:03,151 --> 00:53:04,729
Hi.

339
00:53:19,167 --> 00:53:20,661
Come.

340
00:53:43,066 --> 00:53:44,975
Did you find what I left for you?

341
00:53:51,241 --> 00:53:52,652
Yeah.

342
00:53:54,202 --> 00:53:55,994
That's all they gave us.

343
00:53:57,872 --> 00:53:59,912
My godfather didn't want
to ask for more...

344
00:54:00,125 --> 00:54:01,952
...and he went into hiding.

345
00:54:03,712 --> 00:54:05,751
I don't know when he'll be back.

346
00:54:33,492 --> 00:54:35,152
Wanna do it?

347
00:54:35,536 --> 00:54:37,280
Yes.

348
00:54:45,463 --> 00:54:48,214
Look how dark it is.

349
00:54:50,134 --> 00:54:53,752
Must be the knotweed
that's still blooming.

350
00:54:56,682 --> 00:54:58,093
Beautiful.

351
00:55:06,776 --> 00:55:11,853
Ever since you went by the store
the Mendizabal brothers are acting strange.

352
00:55:12,239 --> 00:55:14,565
The police came by the other day.

353
00:55:14,784 --> 00:55:16,776
They called them.

354
00:55:17,244 --> 00:55:21,491
They wanted to know where you were
the day the ransom was paid.

355
00:55:23,042 --> 00:55:28,831
I told them you went fishing
since it wasn't windy that day...

356
00:55:29,048 --> 00:55:31,800
...but then I remembered
you had told me...

357
00:55:32,009 --> 00:55:35,010
...you were going to visit your brother.
Did you?

358
00:55:36,597 --> 00:55:38,471
Did you go see him?

359
00:55:39,475 --> 00:55:42,180
No. I didn't go.

360
00:55:51,362 --> 00:55:53,354
But what did you say?

361
00:55:54,323 --> 00:55:55,604
To the police.

362
00:55:55,825 --> 00:55:57,864
Nothing, only that.

363
00:55:58,077 --> 00:56:00,484
-What?
-That you went fishing.

364
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:15,884
How weird.

365
00:56:16,555 --> 00:56:18,512
What?

366
00:56:20,934 --> 00:56:23,306
Nothing, really....

367
00:56:23,979 --> 00:56:25,354
You're acting weird...

368
00:56:25,564 --> 00:56:28,565
...and I thought it was because
you'd gone to see your brother.

369
00:56:57,971 --> 00:56:59,216
What an asshole.

370
00:57:10,549 --> 00:57:12,506
Why are you so late?

371
00:57:15,304 --> 00:57:16,882
I don't know.

372
00:57:18,265 --> 00:57:20,174
Let's go, this way.

373
00:57:24,647 --> 00:57:26,105
Hi, Dad.

374
00:57:27,733 --> 00:57:29,393
Sit down.

375
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:32,186
Give Daddy a kiss good night.

376
00:57:35,366 --> 00:57:37,572
May I?

377
00:57:37,826 --> 00:57:40,199
Get inside, it's cold.

378
00:57:43,832 --> 00:57:46,240
I don't think Adrián's coming back.

379
00:57:47,086 --> 00:57:49,209
We need to talk about that.

380
00:57:53,676 --> 00:57:55,004
Did you hear anything?

381
00:57:55,219 --> 00:57:57,971
Baby didn't tell you anything?

382
00:57:59,265 --> 00:58:00,759
No.

383
00:58:02,851 --> 00:58:06,220
Looks like we're on our own
this time, huh?

384
00:58:10,609 --> 00:58:13,943
You still have his gun, right?

385
00:58:17,783 --> 00:58:19,277
Yeah.

386
00:58:19,785 --> 00:58:22,952
Look, I respect my godfather...

387
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:25,665
...but I need the money.

388
00:58:31,423 --> 00:58:32,917
Well?

389
00:58:33,884 --> 00:58:35,461
What do you say?

390
00:59:09,586 --> 00:59:10,866
What did she say?

391
00:59:15,008 --> 00:59:17,713
She said they're looking for you.

392
00:59:17,969 --> 00:59:19,962
And that you're a liar.

393
00:59:51,211 --> 00:59:53,084
Leave that, come here.

394
00:59:54,464 --> 00:59:56,006
Come here, sit down.

395
00:59:56,216 --> 00:59:58,623
It's nice and warm over here.

396
01:00:06,893 --> 01:00:09,431
It doesn't look like it's gonna rain.

397
01:00:11,064 --> 01:00:12,143
No.

398
01:00:22,075 --> 01:00:23,569
What happened to your hand?

399
01:00:24,285 --> 01:00:25,317
Nothing.

400
01:00:26,371 --> 01:00:28,494
I cut myself pulling out nails.

401
01:00:31,626 --> 01:00:32,741
Let me see.

402
01:00:33,086 --> 01:00:34,201
Show me.

403
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:39,759
May I?

404
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:56,605
Does it hurt when I touch it?

405
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:58,693
Does it hurt?

406
01:00:58,904 --> 01:01:00,529
No.

407
01:01:02,199 --> 01:01:05,983
When you get home,
wash it well with white soap, okay?

408
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:14,580
Then put a clean bandage on it
so it won't get dirty.

409
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:19,918
If it gets any redder or feels hot,
let me know.

410
01:01:21,343 --> 01:01:22,802
Yeah?

411
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,788
This seems wrong to me.

412
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:54,375
You're right.

413
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:59,287
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have.

414
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:02,128
You're a baby and I'm...

415
01:02:02,718 --> 01:02:04,592
...an old man.

416
01:02:05,971 --> 01:02:07,216
"Baby" my ass.

417
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:11,801
Why do you call me that
when you know I hate it?

418
01:02:15,731 --> 01:02:18,815
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you.

419
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:33,948
Can you pay me what you owe me?

420
01:02:36,877 --> 01:02:38,288
Sure.

421
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:45,051
That's all I have.

422
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:52,424
Bye.

423
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:16,910
Good morning, Souto. How are you?

424
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:21,212
We're looking for your friend,
Adrián Ortiz.

425
01:03:23,089 --> 01:03:25,046
Do you know where we might find him?

426
01:03:27,884 --> 01:03:29,793
I think he's on a trip.

427
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:32,335
When is he coming back?

428
01:03:34,305 --> 01:03:35,763
I don't know.

429
01:03:43,686 --> 01:03:45,724
You can't come into my
house like this.

430
01:03:47,355 --> 01:03:48,517
Don't get excited.

431
01:03:48,731 --> 01:03:52,015
Search warrant and arrest warrant.
Everything is in order.

432
01:03:52,233 --> 01:03:54,390
I assume you know your rights.

433
01:04:15,748 --> 01:04:18,451
Can you tell me
what you're looking for?

434
01:04:18,791 --> 01:04:20,913
What should we be looking for?

435
01:04:23,461 --> 01:04:24,871
Souto.

436
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:27,494
Haven't seen you in a while.

437
01:04:27,714 --> 01:04:29,705
Give me your other hand.

438
01:04:38,262 --> 01:04:40,384
He's all set. Pass me the keys.

439
01:04:41,472 --> 01:04:43,548
Here, take him.

440
01:04:44,891 --> 01:04:46,005
Wipe your hands.

441
01:04:59,693 --> 01:05:01,436
Sit down.

442
01:05:08,782 --> 01:05:10,905
I got it, leave me the keys.

443
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:16,952
This is from Ortiz.

444
01:05:18,747 --> 01:05:19,945
He says to hang in there.

445
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:25,657
If you don't talk,
they'll let you out sooner.

446
01:05:47,807 --> 01:05:49,265
Well?

447
01:05:49,475 --> 01:05:50,968
Fishing.

448
01:05:52,268 --> 01:05:55,850
-I don't know which river.
-Tough guy, huh?

449
01:05:56,438 --> 01:05:58,476
Think about it, Souto.

450
01:05:58,689 --> 01:06:01,393
Tell me who you were with
the night the ransom was paid.

451
01:06:02,483 --> 01:06:04,724
Give us a name
and we'll leave you alone.

452
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:09,983
I already told you. I was alone.

453
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:14,482
Ask him again.

454
01:06:15,325 --> 01:06:16,984
Ask him again!

455
01:07:31,791 --> 01:07:33,450
Wait here.

456
01:07:37,503 --> 01:07:40,171
Souto. You have a visitor.

457
01:07:47,259 --> 01:07:48,836
You've got half an hour.

458
01:07:53,012 --> 01:07:54,127
Hi.

459
01:07:56,181 --> 01:07:57,509
Hi.

460
01:07:59,934 --> 01:08:01,842
I'm Agustín's wife.

461
01:08:20,405 --> 01:08:21,982
I came because...

462
01:08:25,533 --> 01:08:27,324
...your brother passed away.

463
01:08:27,534 --> 01:08:29,028
A month ago.

464
01:08:30,036 --> 01:08:33,320
Yeah, I know.
I saw the obituary in the paper.

465
01:08:37,624 --> 01:08:39,118
Did you know he was sick?

466
01:08:42,210 --> 01:08:43,538
Yeah.

467
01:08:45,296 --> 01:08:47,252
He did mention something.

468
01:08:55,719 --> 01:08:57,711
Did you hold a wake for him?

469
01:09:00,138 --> 01:09:02,047
Yes, of course.

470
01:09:02,973 --> 01:09:06,388
And we-- We cremated him.

471
01:09:08,143 --> 01:09:12,720
We'd never discussed it,
but I thought it was best.

472
01:09:23,237 --> 01:09:25,774
I still can't believe he's gone.

473
01:09:29,908 --> 01:09:32,066
I feel so guilty....

474
01:09:38,455 --> 01:09:39,830
Guilty of what?

475
01:09:40,665 --> 01:09:43,416
I left him when he was suffering.

476
01:09:43,625 --> 01:09:46,625
I can't forgive myself for that.

477
01:09:57,009 --> 01:09:58,882
-Here.
-Thanks.

478
01:10:16,229 --> 01:10:19,395
None of this is your fault, Claudia.

479
01:10:52,711 --> 01:10:55,379
I found this at home.

480
01:10:55,588 --> 01:10:57,295
Is it yours?

481
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:05,002
Maybe you went to visit
your brother and don't remember.

482
01:11:12,473 --> 01:11:13,671
I'd rather keep it.

483
01:11:22,771 --> 01:11:24,147
I don't....

484
01:11:25,441 --> 01:11:26,472
Claudia....

485
01:11:26,692 --> 01:11:29,526
Don't say anything, Agustín.
What are you going to explain?

486
01:11:29,735 --> 01:11:31,941
This is all so...

487
01:11:32,570 --> 01:11:34,396
...so horrible.

488
01:11:39,950 --> 01:11:43,152
I'm not Agustín. I'm Pedro.

489
01:11:43,327 --> 01:11:44,358
Shut up!

490
01:11:44,578 --> 01:11:47,827
Shut up, for God's sake.
What are you doing?

491
01:11:48,539 --> 01:11:50,330
What are you doing?

492
01:12:00,171 --> 01:12:02,044
What are you going to do?

493
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,334
-Sir!
-What are you going to do?

494
01:12:05,550 --> 01:12:09,166
What do you care?
What do you care?

495
01:12:09,385 --> 01:12:12,421
Why should I tell you
what I'm going to do?

496
01:12:12,637 --> 01:12:14,428
Why?

497
01:12:23,102 --> 01:12:26,102
They're giving me the baby soon.

498
01:12:29,690 --> 01:12:31,682
-Is there a problem?
-Open the door.

499
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:34,390
-Open the door, please!
-Something wrong, ma'am?

500
01:12:36,194 --> 01:12:37,688
What's the problem?

501
01:12:38,779 --> 01:12:40,107
Nothing.

502
01:13:19,763 --> 01:13:21,091
Let's go.

503
01:13:27,101 --> 01:13:28,299
-You all set?
-Yeah.

504
01:13:28,519 --> 01:13:30,262
Come on, let's go.

505
01:13:33,898 --> 01:13:36,186
This one's for my father.

506
01:13:38,693 --> 01:13:40,934
Burn in hell, Ortiz!

507
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,779
What are you drinking?

508
01:15:53,988 --> 01:15:56,525
-Beer.
-Two.

509
01:15:59,575 --> 01:16:02,065
Hi, Rosa. Everything okay?

510
01:16:14,459 --> 01:16:16,368
To you getting out.

511
01:16:17,044 --> 01:16:18,075
Happy birthday.

512
01:16:25,216 --> 01:16:26,758
How old are you now?

513
01:16:26,967 --> 01:16:28,544
Twenty-one.

514
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:31,585
I look older, don't I?

515
01:16:38,433 --> 01:16:40,923
When do you start work
at the supermarket?

516
01:16:41,143 --> 01:16:43,633
I started Monday as a stock girl.

517
01:16:45,688 --> 01:16:48,356
You don't work
at the El Dorado anymore?

518
01:16:48,564 --> 01:16:50,355
-They fired me.
-What?

519
01:16:50,566 --> 01:16:51,976
They fired me!

520
01:17:14,081 --> 01:17:16,618
They say it brings good luck.

521
01:17:19,792 --> 01:17:22,033
-Can you help me?
-Sure.

522
01:17:35,886 --> 01:17:37,344
There.

523
01:17:41,931 --> 01:17:43,674
Thanks.

524
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:53,847
Do you think it's possible to live
without hurting others?

525
01:17:54,691 --> 01:17:59,434
I know it's hard,
but I think we should try.

526
01:17:59,652 --> 01:18:03,399
There's evil in all of us,
that's just how it is.

527
01:18:03,613 --> 01:18:06,317
But if we hurt others,
make them suffer...

528
01:18:06,531 --> 01:18:09,567
...the evil grows, it gets stronger.

529
01:18:10,909 --> 01:18:13,779
On the other hand,
if we're good to others...

530
01:18:13,995 --> 01:18:16,864
...the evil inside us shrinks...

531
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:19,451
...and the evil in others too.

532
01:18:24,543 --> 01:18:26,665
That's my plan.

533
01:18:35,842 --> 01:18:38,248
To be good to others,
no matter who they are.

534
01:18:40,011 --> 01:18:41,421
Yeah.

535
01:18:42,304 --> 01:18:44,011
That's good.

536
01:18:48,558 --> 01:18:50,680
So, what's your plan?

537
01:18:53,853 --> 01:18:56,141
I don't have a plan.

538
01:21:05,479 --> 01:21:08,313
Pedro, Agustín and their friend
Adrián - Summer 1973

539
01:21:53,802 --> 01:21:55,176
Leaving already?

540
01:21:55,386 --> 01:21:57,710
You talked in your sleep.

541
01:22:01,348 --> 01:22:02,972
What did I say?

542
01:22:04,350 --> 01:22:06,591
It sounded like you were crying.

543
01:22:08,269 --> 01:22:10,225
I don't want you to leave.

544
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:16,644
Why don't you stay here with me?

545
01:22:25,906 --> 01:22:27,697
What if he comes back?

546
01:22:29,909 --> 01:22:31,106
Who?

547
01:22:32,244 --> 01:22:34,235
The boogeyman.

548
01:23:17,939 --> 01:23:20,346
-How's it going?
-What's up?

549
01:23:41,704 --> 01:23:43,246
You look good.

550
01:23:48,834 --> 01:23:51,703
Rubén told me you're reformed.

551
01:23:56,339 --> 01:24:00,121
They're looking for you.
Did he tell you that?

552
01:24:01,675 --> 01:24:03,963
Yeah, he did.

553
01:24:10,306 --> 01:24:11,799
Well?

554
01:24:13,266 --> 01:24:15,424
Aren't you gonna offer me a drink?

555
01:24:20,939 --> 01:24:22,598
I'll be right back.

556
01:25:28,857 --> 01:25:31,607
Well, look who's here.

557
01:25:50,370 --> 01:25:52,161
I sure missed you!

558
01:25:55,165 --> 01:25:57,702
Who wouldn't miss Baby?

559
01:25:58,959 --> 01:26:00,453
Have you been a good girl?

560
01:26:00,668 --> 01:26:03,787
Rosa, take those things
to the beehive, please.

561
01:26:10,508 --> 01:26:11,752
Let me go.

562
01:26:12,634 --> 01:26:13,713
Leave her alone!

563
01:26:18,263 --> 01:26:19,507
Go on.

564
01:26:24,642 --> 01:26:27,310
You have something that belongs to me.

565
01:26:27,519 --> 01:26:30,769
Or did you throw it in the river
like a chickenshit?

566
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:39,520
Come on.

567
01:26:57,455 --> 01:26:59,198
Here.

568
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,450
I have some unfinished business
with the fairies from the El Dorado.

569
01:27:05,669 --> 01:27:07,328
Coming with me?

570
01:27:08,587 --> 01:27:10,626
What about the grand you owe me?

571
01:27:43,401 --> 01:27:47,232
"Not one stone shall be left standing.

572
01:27:47,654 --> 01:27:51,520
And when you see
the desolate abomination...

573
01:27:51,740 --> 01:27:56,234
...those who can
may flee to the mountains.

574
01:28:02,497 --> 01:28:06,789
And what I say unto you
I say unto all:

575
01:28:06,999 --> 01:28:11,992
Look, watch and pray."

576
01:28:15,088 --> 01:28:16,879
Word of the Lord.

577
01:28:30,973 --> 01:28:33,725
The family leaves
with the boat at 1630.

578
01:28:33,934 --> 01:28:37,386
They drop off the girl
at tennis class and go to play golf.

579
01:28:37,605 --> 01:28:41,354
The security guards pass at 1650.
More or less.

580
01:28:41,568 --> 01:28:43,561
1650.

581
01:28:43,779 --> 01:28:45,688
That's when...

582
01:28:45,906 --> 01:28:47,365
...Pedro...

583
01:28:47,574 --> 01:28:49,816
...goes in with the jars of honey.

584
01:28:53,497 --> 01:28:56,831
Wait for the maid to shut off
the security cameras...

585
01:28:57,042 --> 01:28:59,664
...go in the kitchen
and close the curtains.

586
01:29:00,129 --> 01:29:02,335
That's the sign Rubén
will be waiting for...

587
01:29:02,548 --> 01:29:04,042
...hiding in the boat.

588
01:29:05,051 --> 01:29:08,384
Then he'll signal me
on the other side of the pier.

589
01:29:08,596 --> 01:29:11,217
I'll go inside and cut the power.

590
01:29:11,516 --> 01:29:15,134
The maid won't notice anything
because the lights will be off.

591
01:29:16,312 --> 01:29:17,687
Any questions?

592
01:29:22,402 --> 01:29:23,896
What?

593
01:29:25,864 --> 01:29:27,655
How can I signal you...

594
01:29:27,866 --> 01:29:32,195
...if I'm crouching
so the guards won't see me?

595
01:29:33,246 --> 01:29:34,277
That's right.

596
01:29:34,497 --> 01:29:36,371
It's too complicated.

597
01:29:38,126 --> 01:29:42,622
You stand up and then crouch again!
That's how!

598
01:29:46,677 --> 01:29:48,716
I think we should grab
the daughter.

599
01:29:48,929 --> 01:29:51,598
She goes home alone
from her tennis class.

600
01:29:52,558 --> 01:29:55,393
There's less risk and more money.

601
01:29:56,395 --> 01:29:57,972
I don't know.

602
01:29:59,231 --> 01:30:00,891
I'm just saying.

603
01:30:02,151 --> 01:30:04,938
This kid is an airhead...

604
01:30:06,030 --> 01:30:09,695
...but I can't abandon him
because he's my godson.

605
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:15,194
Remember...

606
01:30:15,414 --> 01:30:17,703
...how much fun we had here?

607
01:30:17,917 --> 01:30:20,490
I always remember those years.

608
01:30:21,254 --> 01:30:23,827
I missed you two a lot
when you left.

609
01:30:24,674 --> 01:30:28,624
We weren't bad kids,
just a little wild.

610
01:30:29,595 --> 01:30:34,507
But Agustín was very spoiled...

611
01:30:34,726 --> 01:30:37,727
...with that holier-than-thou attitude.

612
01:30:37,937 --> 01:30:42,434
He made you want to spit on him,
beat him up....

613
01:30:42,651 --> 01:30:44,608
He always was a chickenshit.

614
01:30:47,572 --> 01:30:49,066
You're drunk.

615
01:30:49,282 --> 01:30:51,691
-You're getting sentimental.
-No, not us!

616
01:30:52,495 --> 01:30:54,535
We weren't squeamish.

617
01:30:54,747 --> 01:30:59,208
Nothing scared us.
Not pain, getting beat up.

618
01:30:59,419 --> 01:31:01,874
Maybe it was jealousy.

619
01:31:08,470 --> 01:31:11,043
Because deep down
he was always a loser.

620
01:31:15,352 --> 01:31:16,894
What are you after?

621
01:31:18,730 --> 01:31:20,059
And you?

622
01:31:22,109 --> 01:31:24,185
What are you after?

623
01:32:14,996 --> 01:32:17,203
Why don't we get out of here?

624
01:32:18,333 --> 01:32:19,875
And go where?

625
01:32:20,919 --> 01:32:22,579
Upriver.

626
01:32:30,679 --> 01:32:32,422
I don't know....

627
01:32:52,243 --> 01:32:54,615
What do we do once inside?

628
01:32:56,622 --> 01:32:59,708
Stay close to me
and don't do anything stupid.

629
01:33:03,672 --> 01:33:05,665
Tell me, Pedro.

630
01:33:08,010 --> 01:33:11,011
How much money
did you say there might be?

631
01:33:27,697 --> 01:33:29,274
The girl's tasty.

632
01:33:30,408 --> 01:33:33,159
She must be around
the same age as Baby.

633
01:33:34,579 --> 01:33:36,737
Baby gets me hotter, though.

634
01:33:44,672 --> 01:33:47,626
You don't like me
calling her that either?

635
01:33:49,719 --> 01:33:53,337
I don't care what you call her,
just stop bothering her.

636
01:33:53,556 --> 01:33:55,763
Leave her alone.

637
01:33:56,351 --> 01:34:00,978
Why are you defending her?
You have no idea.

638
01:34:01,189 --> 01:34:03,680
Tell me, what do you know
about Baby?

639
01:34:06,361 --> 01:34:09,196
What's that rat been telling you
about me?

640
01:35:19,562 --> 01:35:23,180
I put on the boots Adrián gave me
and started dancing.

641
01:35:29,864 --> 01:35:32,190
Adrián, you're a drone.

642
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:37,695
Drones don't have stingers
or odor.

643
01:35:38,165 --> 01:35:42,293
That's why they can enter any hive,
bringing diseases.

644
01:35:46,298 --> 01:35:49,252
Do I always end up alone?

645
01:36:16,579 --> 01:36:18,406
Do you love me?

646
01:36:19,790 --> 01:36:21,071
Yes.

647
01:36:23,878 --> 01:36:25,871
Will you always love me?

648
01:36:29,968 --> 01:36:31,166
Always.

649
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:36,681
Even if I get old and wrinkled?

650
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:00,749
Were you with him for the money?

651
01:37:01,875 --> 01:37:03,784
Or did you like it?

652
01:37:16,265 --> 01:37:18,056
A little bit of both.

653
01:37:42,501 --> 01:37:43,877
What do you mean no?

654
01:37:44,503 --> 01:37:46,247
No means no.

655
01:37:46,756 --> 01:37:48,665
Count me out.

656
01:37:49,842 --> 01:37:51,585
I'm not going to do it.

657
01:37:51,802 --> 01:37:55,503
Why? Is it Adrián?

658
01:37:56,516 --> 01:38:01,427
It's a long story, Rubén.
I just don't think it's a good idea.

659
01:38:02,188 --> 01:38:03,931
But it was your idea to begin with.

660
01:38:05,525 --> 01:38:08,976
It seemed good at the time,
but not anymore.

661
01:38:10,196 --> 01:38:13,281
-Finish up here, I'll be right back.
-Okay.

662
01:38:31,551 --> 01:38:33,758
How much is the spaghetti, miss?

663
01:38:33,971 --> 01:38:36,544
What brand would you recommend?

664
01:38:36,974 --> 01:38:39,547
What do you want, Adrián? I'm working.

665
01:38:39,768 --> 01:38:41,476
It's just a joke.

666
01:38:41,687 --> 01:38:44,308
Wanna go for a drink tonight?

667
01:38:45,691 --> 01:38:48,182
No, I don't think I can.

668
01:38:51,113 --> 01:38:52,987
Put on something nice.

669
01:38:54,450 --> 01:38:56,941
I'll meet you at the pier
and we'll go for a ride.

670
01:39:47,255 --> 01:39:51,834
SOUTO, Agustín
Pediatrician, died 5-5-2011

671
01:40:09,111 --> 01:40:10,486
What's going on?

672
01:40:13,782 --> 01:40:15,526
Get out!

673
01:40:34,053 --> 01:40:36,461
I won't hurt you.

674
01:40:38,349 --> 01:40:40,638
It's okay, it's okay.

675
01:40:49,444 --> 01:40:51,567
Son of a bitch.

676
01:42:37,013 --> 01:42:38,472
Hi.

677
01:42:40,475 --> 01:42:42,515
It took you long enough.

678
01:42:42,727 --> 01:42:45,100
We thought you were dead.

679
01:42:45,313 --> 01:42:47,555
Well, actually, you are dead, right?

680
01:42:52,112 --> 01:42:53,143
Come in.

681
01:42:54,364 --> 01:42:55,989
Come in!

682
01:43:08,921 --> 01:43:10,997
You missed the party.

683
01:43:18,305 --> 01:43:20,678
You didn't have to involve her in all this.

684
01:43:21,517 --> 01:43:23,260
It was her idea.

685
01:43:23,936 --> 01:43:25,134
Tell him.

686
01:43:28,357 --> 01:43:31,477
They're asking for the ransom all at once.

687
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:35,155
When it's paid, I'll pick it up.

688
01:43:35,698 --> 01:43:38,154
If everything goes well, he'll let me go.

689
01:43:43,665 --> 01:43:45,622
And you'll stay with me.

690
01:43:48,879 --> 01:43:50,539
Did you bring her?

691
01:43:51,674 --> 01:43:54,758
Yeah, she's in my boat.

692
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:57,463
Make yourself comfortable.

693
01:43:58,222 --> 01:44:00,049
Sit down.

694
01:44:02,935 --> 01:44:04,134
Fix him a drink.

695
01:44:05,396 --> 01:44:07,603
Do it!

696
01:44:15,657 --> 01:44:19,156
The little whore told me
she didn't love me.

697
01:44:20,704 --> 01:44:22,198
You were right.

698
01:44:24,207 --> 01:44:25,749
Did she tell you she loves you?

699
01:44:25,959 --> 01:44:30,253
You already have me.
Why not let her go?

700
01:44:41,934 --> 01:44:43,973
You'll never be like Pedro.

701
01:44:44,770 --> 01:44:47,178
Even though you both grew up here.

702
01:44:48,857 --> 01:44:51,775
You were never from here
and you never will be.

703
01:44:58,534 --> 01:44:59,909
You know why?

704
01:45:02,622 --> 01:45:05,326
Because you were always a chickenshit.

705
01:45:06,167 --> 01:45:07,994
And that doesn't....

706
01:45:08,920 --> 01:45:11,245
Doesn't change with time.

707
01:45:11,923 --> 01:45:14,081
Baby will always be trash...

708
01:45:14,801 --> 01:45:16,840
...my godson an idiot.

709
01:45:18,263 --> 01:45:22,177
I'll always be a pain in the ass,
whatever....

710
01:45:22,392 --> 01:45:25,428
There's no room for big changes.

711
01:45:27,314 --> 01:45:32,189
Pedro always said
that we should learn from the bees...

712
01:45:32,402 --> 01:45:35,403
...because they each have their role
in the hive...

713
01:45:35,614 --> 01:45:38,817
...from birth to death.

714
01:45:39,576 --> 01:45:41,320
He always did whatever he wanted.

715
01:45:42,913 --> 01:45:44,241
Yeah.

716
01:45:44,748 --> 01:45:46,491
He was a special guy.

717
01:45:48,752 --> 01:45:49,783
I'll miss him.

718
01:45:52,548 --> 01:45:54,375
Me too.

719
01:45:55,592 --> 01:45:56,921
You?

720
01:46:01,516 --> 01:46:03,842
He always came to me.

721
01:46:04,061 --> 01:46:05,341
Yeah.

722
01:46:05,562 --> 01:46:08,053
He respected me.

723
01:46:08,607 --> 01:46:10,018
Pedro could see...

724
01:46:10,234 --> 01:46:14,397
...and he saw something important in me
that no one else did.

725
01:46:15,447 --> 01:46:17,523
Nobody's that important, Adrián.

726
01:46:19,535 --> 01:46:20,566
No?

727
01:46:22,955 --> 01:46:24,366
No.

728
01:46:26,876 --> 01:46:28,536
Neither are you.

729
01:46:33,382 --> 01:46:35,589
Say goodbye quickly.

730
01:46:56,406 --> 01:46:57,865
Come on.

731
01:47:03,788 --> 01:47:04,951
Come on, come on!

732
01:47:15,634 --> 01:47:17,377
Let's go, let's go!

733
01:47:18,845 --> 01:47:20,256
Move it.

734
01:47:22,850 --> 01:47:26,053
What are you doing?
Keep an eye on him.

735
01:47:29,940 --> 01:47:32,727
It was his idea to bring Rosa.

736
01:47:33,110 --> 01:47:35,862
-I told him not to, but you know him.
-Rubén!

737
01:47:36,071 --> 01:47:38,111
Put down the firewood
and watch him!

738
01:48:00,847 --> 01:48:03,219
Stop! Stop!

739
01:48:03,433 --> 01:48:04,464
Stop!

740
01:49:36,112 --> 01:49:37,772
Rosa.

741
01:49:38,990 --> 01:49:40,568
I'm here.

742
01:50:22,244 --> 01:50:24,320
Do you love me?

743
01:50:26,832 --> 01:50:28,326
Yes.

744
01:50:33,714 --> 01:50:36,121
I love you very much.

745
01:50:36,758 --> 01:50:38,383
You know?

746
01:50:43,599 --> 01:50:45,556
I love you too.

747
01:50:58,656 --> 01:51:02,606
Will you always love me?

748
01:51:21,262 --> 01:51:23,338
Always.
