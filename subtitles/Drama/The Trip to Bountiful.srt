1
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:29,544
Don't try to be quiet, sonny. I'm awake.

2
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:33,278
Yes, ma'am.

3
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:36,283
- Couldn't you sleep?
- No, ma'am.

4
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,690
- Why couldn't you sleep?
- I just couldn't.

5
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,819
- Couldn't you sleep?
- No, I haven't been to bed at all.

6
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:49,500
You're not worrying about your job,
are you, sonny?

7
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,298
No, ma'am.

8
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,466
Everybody seems to like me there.

9
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:01,370
- I'm thinking about asking for a raise.
- You should, hard as you work.

10
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:12,146
- Why couldn't you sleep, Mama?
- Because it's a full moon.

11
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,886
I never could sleep
when there's a full moon.

12
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:20,065
Even back in Bountiful,
when I worked out in the fields all day...

13
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:23,591
and I got so tired I thought
my legs would just give out on me...

14
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,265
you let there be a full moon,
and I'd just toss the night away.

15
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:38,408
I remember once when you were little
and there was a full moon.

16
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,815
I woke you up and dressed you
and took you for a walk with me.

17
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,448
- Do you remember that?
- No, ma'am.

18
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:45,923
- You don't?
- No, ma'am.

19
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:49,120
I remember that,
it's just like it was yesterday.

20
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,521
I dressed you and took you outside...

21
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,397
and there was an old dog
howling away someplace...

22
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:57,931
and that scared you.

23
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,666
And I held you.
You were just trembling with fear...

24
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,868
and you said someone told you
that when a dog howled...

25
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:06,036
a person was dying somewhere.

26
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,443
And I held you close to me...

27
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:11,711
and then you asked me
to explain to you about dying.

28
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:16,648
And I said, "You're too young to worry
about things like that for a long time."

29
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,924
It's funny the things you think of
when you can't sleep.

30
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,159
I was trying to think of that song
I used to like to hear you sing.

31
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,092
What was that, sonny?

32
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,160
I don't remember the name. I just remember
I'd always laugh when you'd sing it.

33
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,534
That old song. That was...

34
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,475
I hate it when I can't think of things.

35
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:54,555
<i>Hush, little baby, don't say a word</i>

36
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:58,555
<i>'Cause Mama's gonna buy you</i>
<i>a mockingbird</i>

37
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,429
<i>And if that mockingbird don't sing</i>

38
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,901
<i>Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring</i>

39
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,574
I used to think I was gonna buy you
the world back in those days.

40
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:16,414
I remember remarking that to my papa.

41
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,278
He said the world can't be bought.

42
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,050
I didn't rightly understand
what he meant by that then.

43
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,962
Oh, Ludie... Well, no.

44
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:35,790
Would you like me
to get you some hot milk?

45
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:39,565
Yes, ma'am, if you don't mind.

46
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,799
How do you expect to work tomorrow
if you don't get your sleep, Ludie?

47
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:41,163
Mother Watts...

48
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:45,727
what did you do with that recipe
that Rosella gave me on the phone today?

49
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:48,933
Jessie Mae, I don't remember you
having given me any recipe.

50
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,899
Well, I did.

51
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,571
This morning, right here in this very room...

52
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:56,444
and I asked you
to please put it on my dresser...

53
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:59,713
and you said, "I will,"
and went out holding it in your hand.

54
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,353
- Did you look on your dresser?
- Yes, ma'am.

55
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:04,951
And it wasn't there?

56
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,925
No, ma'am.
I looked just before I went to bed.

57
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,328
We are just gonna have to get out
a little more, Ludie.

58
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,235
It's no wonder you can't sleep.

59
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:24,735
Every couple I know goes out
three or four times a week.

60
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:28,609
I know we couldn't afford it before,
so I kept quiet about it.

61
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:30,615
But now that you're working again...

62
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:34,175
I don't think a picture show
once or twice a week would break us.

63
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,148
Okay. Why don't we go out
one night this week?

64
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,758
I mean, I think we have to.

65
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:43,528
I was talking to Rosella about it
this morning on the phone.

66
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,962
When did you and Rosella
get friendly again?

67
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,363
This morning.

68
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:50,163
She just all of a sudden called me up
on the telephone.

69
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:52,431
She said she would quit being mad
if I would.

70
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:55,338
I said, shucks, I wasn't mad,
she was the one that was mad.

71
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:59,069
I told her I was plain-spoken
and said exactly what I felt...

72
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,546
and people have to take me as I am
or just leave me alone.

73
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,684
Rosella found out definitely
she can't have any children.

74
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,559
Walk, don't run.

75
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:21,723
Your mother's pension check
didn't come today.

76
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:26,869
It's the 18th. I swear it's due.

77
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:31,165
I just don't understand the government.
Always late.

78
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:46,189
Rosella was glad to hear
you're working again.

79
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,826
She said she was cleaning some drawers
night before last...

80
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,297
and had come across
some pictures she'd taken...

81
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,596
of you and me
when we started going together.

82
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,694
I said, I don't care to see them.
No, thank you.

83
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,598
Passing of time makes me sad.

84
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,837
Jessie Mae, here's your recipe.

85
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,935
Thank you. Where did you find it?

86
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,480
- In your room.
- In my room?

87
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,810
Yes, ma'am.

88
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,344
Where in my room?

89
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,612
In your dresser drawer. Right-hand side.

90
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,483
- In my dresser drawer?
- Yes, ma'am.

91
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:19,013
I looked on the top of your dresser,
wasn't there, something told me...

92
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,685
Ludie,
how many times have I asked her never...

93
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,493
to look into my dresser drawers?

94
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,158
You wanted me to find the recipe.

95
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,429
I don't want you to go
into my dresser drawers.

96
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,801
I'd like a little privacy, if you don't mind.

97
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:33,896
Yes, ma'am.

98
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:37,773
And don't you ever let me catch you
looking in them again for anything.

99
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,747
I can't stand people snooping
in my dresser drawers.

100
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:44,544
All right. Next time you just find it yourself!

101
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:49,781
You pick that recipe up, if you please?

102
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:54,157
Pick it up yourself.
I have no intention of picking that up!

103
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:56,592
- You pick that up!
- I won't!

104
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,220
- Mama.
- You will!

105
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,891
For God's sake,
you're both acting like children.

106
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,332
It's 1:30 in the morning.

107
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:05,393
- You make her pick that up.
- I won't!

108
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:10,065
You will! This is my house
and you'll do exactly as you're told!

109
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:14,937
Oh, now. I hope you're satisfied.

110
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,709
You have got Ludie good and upset.

111
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,615
- He won't sleep for the rest of the night.
- Shut up, up there!

112
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:22,586
What are you trying to do?
Get him sick again?

113
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:26,887
- Shut that goddamn radio off!
- You shut up!

114
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:30,386
You're going too far with me
one of these days, old lady!

115
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,590
- Jessie Mae.
- I can't stand it, Ludie.

116
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,189
I'm at the end of my rope.

117
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:38,396
I will not take being insulted by your mama
or anyone else! You hear that?

118
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:05,123
Mama, will you give this recipe
to Jessie Mae?

119
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:08,697
All right, son.

120
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:11,896
Mama, will you please tell
Jessie Mae that you're sorry?

121
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,171
- Ludie.
- Please, Mama.

122
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,742
<i>... late-night sound, and we'll be right</i>
<i>here with you till dawn.</i>

123
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,678
<i>This next trio,</i>
<i>the best in big-band sounds...</i>

124
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:26,445
<i>is brought to you by the</i>
<i>Grand Prize Brewing Company of Galveston.</i>

125
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,577
All right.

126
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,587
<i>Grand Prize is the reason why.</i>

127
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,792
What do you want, Ludie?

128
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:42,893
Mama has something to say to you.

129
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,411
- What is it?
- Jessie Mae, I am sorry...

130
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:57,811
for throwing the recipe on the floor.

131
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,281
I accept your apology.

132
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:20,269
Jessie Mae, I know it's hard and all,
but for your own sake...

133
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,069
I sometimes think if you could
ignore certain things...

134
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,806
Ignore?

135
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,974
Why, how can you ignore something...

136
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,812
when it is done right under your very nose?

137
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,284
- Jessie Mae, nobody...
- I know her, Ludie.

138
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,887
She does things just to aggravate me.

139
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,024
Now, you take her hymn singing.

140
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,756
She never starts until I come into a room.

141
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,595
And her pouting?

142
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:47,627
Why, sometimes she goes...

143
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,999
a whole day just sitting there,
staring out the window.

144
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,730
How would you like to spend
24 hours a day...

145
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,003
shut up with a woman
who either sang hymns...

146
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,908
or looked out the window and pouted?

147
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,742
I'm not saying it's easy, I'm only...

148
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:05,011
It just keeps me so nervous,
never knowing when I leave...

149
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,518
whether she's gonna run off
to that old town or not.

150
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:10,749
She's not gonna run off.
She promised us she wouldn't.

151
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:14,383
Sometimes I think she hides that check...

152
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:18,588
and I tell you right now,
if it is not here tomorrow...

153
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:21,394
I am gonna search this house
from top to bottom.

154
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,770
Rosella asked me
if I realized it would be 15 years...

155
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,779
this August since we were married.

156
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,108
Right.

157
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:43,512
I never will forget the night I came home
and told Rosella you had proposed.

158
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:48,189
I thought you were
the handsomest man alive.

159
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:51,256
And I thought you were the prettiest girl.

160
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:53,929
Did you, Ludie?

161
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,472
Jessie Mae, I've got to start making
some more money.

162
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,673
I'm thinking about asking for a raise.
I'm entitled to it.

163
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:06,336
I've been there six months
and not been late or sick once.

164
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:09,040
I'm walking into Mr. Douglas' office
the first thing...

165
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:12,641
and saying, "I have got to have a raise
starting as of right now.

166
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:14,811
"We can't live on what you pay us."

167
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,117
Well! I would.

168
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,451
I don't understand it, Jessie Mae.

169
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,961
I try not to be bitter and I try not to...

170
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:26,658
I don't know.

171
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:32,229
All I know is a man works for a company
for eight years.

172
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,235
He saves a little money.

173
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:37,670
He gets sick...

174
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:41,371
and he has to spend two years in bed
watching his savings all go.

175
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:44,175
And then start all over with a new company.

176
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,842
The doctor says not to worry about it.

177
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,581
He says you have
to take things like they come.

178
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,713
And that's what I do. Every day.

179
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,435
- What's this book?
- It's mine.

180
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:08,473
I bought it at the drugstore,
coming from the office.

181
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,938
<i>How to Become an Executive?</i>

182
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:17,580
My boss likes me.

183
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:21,617
Billy Davis told me he did,
he was positive he did. Today, he told me.

184
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:24,554
Billy Davis has been there 10 years now,
you know?

185
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,020
You getting sleepy now?

186
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,562
Yes. Are you?

187
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:34,830
Yes, I am.

188
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:38,434
Good night.

189
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,766
Good night.

190
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,671

193
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,847

- I'm all right, sonny.

194
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,648
I'm just still not sleepy.

195
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:57,848
Good night.

196
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:01,558
Ludie, please, son, I want to go home.

197
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:08,428
Mama, you know I can't make a living there.
We have to live in Houston.

198
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:15,198
Son, Ludie, I cannot stay here any longer.

199
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,366
I want to go home.

200
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,311
I beg you not to ask me this again.

201
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,547
There is nothing I can do about it.

202
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,295
- Ludie, it's 8:15! Uppity, uppity, uppity!
- Yes, ma'am.

203
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,634
<i>We shall gather at the river</i>

204
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,004
It's too early for hymn singing.

205
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,237
Walk, don't run.

206
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:39,021
- Morning, Mama.
- Morning, son.

207
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,787
I'll have your toast ready for you
in a minute.

208
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,757
Why don't we have an early supper tonight?

209
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,027
6:30, if that's all right with you and Mama?

210
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:52,229
And after supper I'll take you both
to the picture show.

211
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:55,865
Do you want to go downtown
or to one of the neighborhood movies?

212
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,841
Whatever you want to do, Jessie Mae.

213
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,777
Maybe it would do us good to go downtown.

214
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,710
Billy's picking me up.

215
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,812
I want to get in early.
Mr. Douglas is usually in before 9:00.

216
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:13,858
I think I'm doing the right thing
asking for a raise, don't you?

217
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:14,984
Sure.

218
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:21,528
Rita, this is Jessie Mae Watts.
Can I have an appointment for my hair?

219
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:28,734
2:00? Nothing earlier?

220
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,870
I'll see you then. Bye.

221
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:35,045
- Bye, Mama.
- Bye, son.

222
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:40,614
- Holler if there's any mail down there.
- All right, I will.

223
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,888
- No mail for us.
- All right.

224
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:59,531
I can't understand about that pension check.
Can you?

225
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:01,237
No, ma'am.

226
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:07,078
You know, you are so absent-minded.

227
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:11,279
You don't think that you put it around
the room someplace...

228
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:12,809
by mistake?

229
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,352
I don't believe so.

230
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,850
<i>You're listening to KTRH in Houston</i>
<i>on a beautiful Wednesday morning.</i>

231
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:58,055
<i>Clear skies, it's currently 68 degrees.</i>

232
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:01,760
Bus wasn't fast enough for you
this morning, Ludie?

233
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,495
No. I'm hoping to get a chance
to speak to the boss...

234
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,868
before we start our work this morning.

235
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:10,070
- How's everything with your family?
- Fine.

236
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,406
The kids were full of life
this morning as, usual.

237
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:14,707
I said to Myrtle Sue, "My Lord, have mercy...

238
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,476
"we have a lot of live wires around here,
don't we?"

239
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,744
- How's your wife?
- She's fine.

240
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,379
Your mother lives with you, too,
doesn't she?

241
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:24,819
She sure does.

242
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:30,994
I'm gonna call Rosella and tell her
to meet me at the drugstore for a Coke.

243
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,497
<i>Calling, O sinner</i>

244
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:37,092
Would you stop that hymn singing?
Want me to jump right out of my skin?

245
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:40,066
You know what hymns do to my nerves.

246
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,711
And don't pout.
You know I can't stand pouting.

247
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:50,145
I didn't mean to pout, Jessie Mae.
I just meant to be silent.

248
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,409
She's not home.

249
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,919
I bet she's at the drugstore right now.

250
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:01,717
Can't make up my mind
what movie I wanna see tonight.

251
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,519
Well, I'll ask Rosella.

252
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:08,495
Would you stop that noise for a minute?

253
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:13,532
I'm nervous.

254
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,004
You know, when I first came to Houston...

255
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:21,136
I went to three picture shows in one day.

256
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,114
I went to the Kirby in the morning...

257
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:26,844
the Metropolitan in the afternoon...

258
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:29,011
and the Majestic that night.

259
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:45,100
- Mother Watts!
- I'm all right, Jessie Mae.

260
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,001
- Is it your heart?
- No.

261
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:50,041
It's just a little sinking spell.

262
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:54,442
I think just... If I can just lie down
on the sofa for a minute, I'll be all right.

263
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:59,915
- Can I get you some water?
- Thank you.

264
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,147
- Do you want me to call a doctor?
- No, ma'am.

265
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,658
- Do you want me to call Ludie?
- No, ma'am.

266
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:22,298
Are you feeling better now?

267
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:24,438
Yes, I am, Jessie Mae.

268
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:27,839
Do you think you ought to get up so soon?

269
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:30,279
Yes, ma'am. I'm feeling better already.

270
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,517
I think I'll just sit here in this chair.

271
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:46,252
All right. I'll just sit here for a while
and keep you company.

272
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:53,567
It always scares the daylights out of me
when you get one of those sinking spells.

273
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,605
What do you think of the Buffs' chances
in the Dixie Series?

274
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,442
I think they gotta take
the Texas League first.

275
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:02,502
That's right.

276
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:05,015
We're going out
to Buff Stadium Friday night...

277
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,880
- if you'd like to go.
- That's nice.

278
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,852
You can bring your wife and mom
if you want.

279
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,285
Sounds like fun.

280
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,391
Hello?

281
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,939
Hello, Rosella. I tried to call you earlier.

282
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:31,976
You were at the drugstore.
That's what I just figured.

283
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:37,412
I would like to, but Mother Watts has had
another sinking spell and l...

284
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:39,177
No. You go on, Jessie Mae.

285
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:43,119
I'm going to be all right. I'll just rest here.
There's nothing you can do for me.

286
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:46,055
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure, Jessie Mae.

287
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,990
Well, all right, then.

288
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:52,361
Rosella, Mother Watts says
that she won't be needing me here.

289
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,332
So I think I will come over
for just a little while.

290
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:59,668
All right. I'll see you then. Bye.

291
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:05,772
Now, are you sure you're gonna be all right?

292
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:07,505
Yes, Jessie Mae.

293
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,273
I'll go on over then.

294
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:15,283
Now you call me over at the drugstore
if you need me, you hear?

295
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:16,547
Yes, ma'am.

296
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,124
I forgot to take any money.

297
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:14,571
Who are you writing to?

298
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:19,079
I just thought I'd drop a line to Callie Davis
to let her know I'm still alive.

299
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:22,579
Why did you decide to do that
all of a sudden?

300
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:25,987
No reason. Notion just struck me.

301
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:28,818
All right.

302
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:36,361
But if you are trying to put something
over on me with that pension check...

303
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:39,001
I have told Mr. Reynolds
at the grocery store...

304
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,061
never to cash anything for you.

305
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,522
- Morning, Mrs. Watts!
- Good morning, hon.

306
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,656
- How are you doing?
- Just fine.

307
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:39,787
- That's true.
- Child, look at that clock.

308
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,257
It's 10:15.

309
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:45,285
Maybe I better get back up to Mother Watts.
She wasn't feeling so well this morning.

310
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:55,436
I'll just try on this dress.

311
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:12,145
<i>1117 is now ready for boarding on track 28.</i>

312
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:16,893
<i>1117 bound for McAllen...</i>

313
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:20,158
<i>is now ready for boarding on track 28.</i>

314
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,099
A ticket to Bountiful, please.

315
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:24,829
- Where?
- Bountiful.

316
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:26,996
It's between Harrison and Cotton.

317
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,031
No trains go there anymore.

318
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,970
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

319
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:38,007
There used to be excursions between
Bountiful and Houston, you know.

320
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,711
I remember, because I was...

321
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:42,412
No trains go there now.

322
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:57,195
<i>Bus now boarding for Chenango, Aratola...</i>

323
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:59,566
<i>Rosharon, Angleton...</i>

324
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:01,901
<i>Clute, and Velasco.</i>

325
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:11,672
Mother Watts, I'm home.

326
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,551
Lady? Lady, it's your turn.

327
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:25,027
Yes, excuse me.
I would like a ticket to Bountiful, please.

328
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,864
- Where?
- To Bountiful.

329
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:31,566
- What's it near?
- It's between Harrison and Cotton.

330
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:40,541
- Lady?
- Yes, sir.

331
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:43,146
I can sell you a ticket
to Harrison or to Cotton.

332
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:44,875
But there's no Bountiful.

333
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,509
Yes, there is.
It's between Harrison and Cotton.

334
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:48,711
I'm sorry, lady.

335
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:52,188
You say there is, but the book
says there isn't. And the book don't lie.

336
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:54,555
Well. But I'm...

337
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,355
Make up your mind, lady.
Cotton or Harrison?

338
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:59,419
There are other people waiting.

339
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:02,429
Well, let me see.

340
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,936
- How much is the ticket to Harrison?
- $3.50.

341
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,905
- Cotton?
- $4.20.

342
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:13,741
Yes. Well, give me
a ticket to Harrison, please.

343
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,143
All right.

344
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:20,383
- That'll be $3.50, please.
- Yes, sir.

345
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:23,513
Could you cash a pension check?

346
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:26,716
I came at the last minute
and couldn't go by the grocery store.

347
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:27,951
I can't cash any checks.

348
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:30,927
It's perfectly good. It is a government check.

349
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,223
I'm sorry.

350
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,424
It's against the rules to cash checks.

351
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,933
Is that so?

352
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,871
Well, I can understand that. A rule is a rule.

353
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:48,842
- Now, how much was that again?
- $3.50.

354
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,747
$3.50.

355
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:02,888
Just a minute. It is all in here.

356
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:06,029
Nickels and dimes and quarters.

357
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:22,404
There. Now, I believe that is $3.50.

358
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,971
- Thank you.
- That's quite all right.

359
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,574
Sorry to have taken up
so much of your time.

360
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:33,248
Here, lady. Don't forget your ticket.

361
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:35,292
Oh, good heavens!

362
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,361
I'd forget my head if it wasn't on my neck.

363
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,967
Taylor. Two, please.

364
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:57,341
<i>The Beaumont express bus will be</i>
<i>delayed by 30 minutes.</i>

365
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,491
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

366
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,980
Would you watch this suitcase for me?
I'll be right back.

367
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,176
Yes, ma'am.

368
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,299
- This seat taken?
- No, ma'am.

369
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,971
Kind of warm, isn't it,
when you're running around?

370
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,873
Yes, ma'am.

371
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:02,246
I had to get myself ready
in the biggest kind of a hurry...

372
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:05,476
and I'm trying to get to a town
nobody here has heard of.

373
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,615
- What town is that?
- Bountiful.

374
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:11,885
- Did you ever hear of it?
- No.

375
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:14,754
Yeah, that's what I mean.
Nobody's heard of it.

376
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:19,125
Not much of a town left, I guess.

377
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:22,189
I haven't seen it myself in almost 20 years.

378
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:26,226
It used to be quite prosperous.

379
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:30,368
But all they had left was a post office...

380
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:35,677
and a filling station and a general store,
at least when I left it.

381
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,008
- Do your people live there?
- No. My people are all dead.

382
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:43,647
Except for my son and his wife, Jessie Mae.

383
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:45,518
They live here in the city.

384
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:52,089
No, I'm hurrying to go
see Bountiful before I die.

385
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:54,097
I had a sinking spell this morning...

386
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:57,293
I had to get down on the bed and rest.
It was my heart.

387
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:01,031
- Do you have a bad heart?
- Well, it's not what you call a good one.

388
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:03,503
Doctor says it'll last me...

389
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:07,273
as long as I need it
if I could just cut out worrying.

390
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:11,076
But I can't seem to do that lately.

391
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,883
Could you keep your eye
on that suitcase again?

392
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:17,011
Of course.

393
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:27,124
Lady, is there something wrong?

394
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:30,463
No, honey, I'm just a little nervous.
That's all.

395
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,036
Say a prayer for me, honey.

396
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:39,372
- Good luck.
- Good luck to you.

397
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:45,607
Ludie, she always tries to go by train.

398
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:49,512
But, no, we wait at one railroad station
for five minutes...

399
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:53,387
and because she isn't there right then,
you drag me on over here.

400
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,851
We've always found her there.

401
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,020
Why, she won't believe them at the depot...

402
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,360
when they tell her
there isn't a train to Bountiful.

403
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,728
She says there is...

404
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:06,327
and you watch, as far as she's concerned,
that is how it'll have to be.

405
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:11,831
I think we ought to just turn
this whole thing over to the police.

406
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:15,743
- That would scare her once and for all.
- We are not gonna call any police.

407
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:18,213
It's $1.63 and there's no tax...

408
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:21,308
Did a lady come here to buy a ticket
to a town named Bountiful?

409
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:22,852
Not since I've been on duty.

410
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,718
- How long have you been on duty?
- About 15 minutes.

411
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,121
Sorry.

412
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:35,062
Excuse me. Do you have a match?
My lighter is out of fluid.

413
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,334
Oh, thank you.

414
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:44,238
I hope you're lucky enough
not to have to fool around with any in-laws.

415
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:47,607
I've got a mother-in-law
about to drive me crazy.

416
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:51,346
She's always trying to run off
to this place called Bountiful.

417
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:55,849
Of course, there has not been a train
to that old town in l-don't-know when.

418
00:35:56,287 --> 00:36:00,656
But you try and tell her that, and she just
looks at you like you're making it up.

419
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:03,517
But I was too trusting today.

420
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:06,492
I gave her every chance
in the world to get away.

421
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:09,961
People ask me
why I don't have any children.

422
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:14,601
I say I've got Ludie and Mother Watts.
That's all the children I need.

423
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:18,874
What did you bring me? I've seen that one.

424
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,419
I think we are wasting our time sitting here.

425
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:33,980
You want to go to the other train station?

426
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:39,162
I don't care what you do. It is your mother.

427
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,239
Would you like this? I never read them...

428
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,334
and my wife has already seen it.

429
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,137
Thank you.

430
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,176
Is this...

431
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:06,086
Hi. Just by any chance did you see
a woman about...

432
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:07,715
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

433
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:10,492
Excuse me, miss.

434
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:14,759
Miss, I just found this handkerchief there
and it belongs, I think, to my mother.

435
00:37:14,832 --> 00:37:18,893
She has a serious heart condition and it
might be real serious for her to be alone.

436
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,438
I don't think she has money,
and I'd like to find her.

437
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:25,669
Do you remember having seen her? She'd be
on her way to a town called Bountiful.

438
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:29,837
Yes, I did see her. She was here
talking to me. She left all of a sudden.

439
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:36,914
Well, thank you so much.

440
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:42,853
I was right. She was here.
That lady there saw her.

441
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,953
- We're not gonna wait.
- That lady there was talking with her.

442
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:49,261
We are not going to wait.
I talked it all over with the police.

443
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,392
- You didn't really call them?
- I did...

444
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:55,405
and they said in their opinion she's just
trying to get our attention this way...

445
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:59,170
and that we should just go home
and pay her no mind at all.

446
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:03,070
They say such things are very common
among young people and old people...

447
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:04,512
and they're positive...

448
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:07,176
if we just go home and show her
that we don't care...

449
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,811
if she goes or stays,
she'll return of her own free will.

450
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:12,720
We are going to do
what the police tell us to.

451
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:17,018
Now, Ludie,
I wish you'd think of me for a change.

452
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:21,762
I am not gonna spend the rest of my life
running after your mother.

453
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:24,464
All right, Jessie Mae.

454
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:29,799
Come on. Let's go.

455
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,844
- Come on.
- All right.

456
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,540
But if Mama isn't home in an hour,
I'm going after her.

457
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,742
All right.

458
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,950
<i>The bus for Brazoria is now ready</i>
<i>for departure.</i>

459
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:51,055
<i>Passengers for Harrison, Cotton, Old Gulf...</i>

460
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:54,154
<i>and Corpus Christi will change at Gerard.</i>

461
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:05,017
- Is this one yours?
- Yes.

462
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:07,256
- I'll get it.
- Thank you, sir.

463
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:13,901
- How long a wait do we have?
- I'd say about an hour.

464
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:16,433
- Mercy.
- Well, it can't be helped.

465
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:19,270
Oh, no, sir, I know.
I know it can't be helped.

466
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:21,402
Well, we have to take what comes.

467
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:54,538
- Do you have far to go?
- Right far. Corpus.

468
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,907
You know what Corpus Christi
means in Spanish?

469
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:01,508
- Why, no, I don't.
- The body of Christ.

470
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,884
Oh? That so?

471
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,821
I never heard that, did you?

472
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:09,920
No, I sure hadn't.

473
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,656
The body of Christ. Is that right?

474
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:15,930
Isn't that right?

475
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,134
<i>You know that I don't understand English.</i>

476
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:25,372
I see it coming!

477
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,347
Oh, my. Yes.

478
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:34,575
I sure am glad to see it.

479
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:20,354
- The bus is nice to ride, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

480
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:27,800
Excuse me for getting personal...

481
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:31,799
but what is a pretty girl like you
doing traveling alone?

482
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:36,975
My husband's just been sent overseas.
I'm going to stay with my family.

483
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:39,072
Oh, I'm sorry to hear.

484
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:42,084
You just say the 91st Psalm
over and over to yourself.

485
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:44,814
It will be a bower of strength
and protection to him.

486
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:47,914
"He that dwelleth in the secret place
of the most High...

487
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:50,961
"shall abide under the shadow
of the Almighty.

488
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:55,055
"I will say of my Lord,
He is my refuge and my fortress."

489
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:01,937
I'm sorry, honey.

490
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:05,508
That's all right.
I'm just Ionesome for him, is all.

491
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:09,239
You keep him under the Lord's wing
and he'll be safe.

492
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:13,349
Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.

493
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,781
I don't know what gets into me.

494
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:20,290
Nobody needs to be ashamed of crying
'cause we've all dampened a pillow...

495
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:24,253
sometime or other. I know I have.

496
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:29,290
- lf only I could learn not to worry.
- I know, guess we all ask that.

497
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,734
Jessie Mae, my daughter-in-law, don't worry.

498
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:35,772
"What for?" she says. Well, like I tell her...

499
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:40,975
that's a fine attitude, if you can cultivate it.
Trouble is, I can't any longer.

500
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:44,478
It is hard.

501
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:49,648
I didn't used to worry. When I was a girl, I
was so carefree. I had lots to worry me, too.

502
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:53,315
Everybody was so poor back in Bountiful,
but we got along.

503
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:57,352
I said to my papa once
after our third crop failure in a row...

504
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:59,760
whoever named this place Bountiful?

505
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:03,764
He said his papa did, because in those days
it was the land of plenty.

506
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:06,962
You just dropped seeds in the ground
and crops would spring up.

507
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:11,770
We had cotton and corn and sugar cane.
I think it's the prettiest place I ever heard of.

508
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:15,800
Jessie Mae says it's the ugliest,
but she only says that to bother me.

509
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,973
And she only saw it once,
and that was on a rainy day, at that.

510
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:22,416
She says it's nothing but an old swamp.
"That may be," I said...

511
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:24,920
"but it's a mighty pretty swamp to me."

512
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:46,834
- Mrs. Watts?
- Yes?

513
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:49,774
I think I ought to tell you this.

514
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:53,374
I don't want you to think I'm interfering
in your business but, you see...

515
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:56,283
your son and daughter-in-law
came in just after you left.

516
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:59,322
I know. I saw them coming.
That's why I left so fast.

517
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:04,583
- Your son seemed very concerned.
- Oh, bless his heart.

518
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:07,959
He found a handkerchief that you dropped.

519
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:12,562
Mercy. That's right, I did.

520
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:16,865
He asked me if I'd seen you.

521
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:20,835
I felt I had to say yes. I wouldn't have said
a thing if he hadn't asked.

522
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:24,677
Oh, that's all right. I would have done
the same thing in your place.

523
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:29,211
- Did you talk to Jessie Mae?
- Well, yes, I did.

524
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:32,881
Isn't she a sight?
I bet she told you I was crazy.

525
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:37,387
- Well...
- No, don't worry about hurting my feelings.

526
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,691
Poor Jessie Mae thinks everybody is crazy...

527
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:43,563
if they don't wanna sit in a beauty parlor
all day and drink Coca-Cola.

528
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:56,602
I think Ludie knows how I feel about getting
back to Bountiful because...

529
00:46:57,181 --> 00:47:01,743
once when we were talking about something
that happened back there in the old days...

530
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:04,653
he burst out crying...

531
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:09,625
and so overcome, he had to leave the room.

532
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,324
That's a pretty hymn.
What's the name of that?

533
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:53,102
<i>Softly and Tenderly Jesus is Calling.</i>

534
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:56,733
- Do you like hymns?
- Yes, I do.

535
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:58,469
So do I.

536
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:03,504
Jessie Mae says they're going out of style,
but I don't agree.

537
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,241
What's your favorite hymn?

538
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:10,115
- I don't know.
- The one I was just singing is mine.

539
00:48:10,187 --> 00:48:14,214
I bet I'd sing that a hundred times a day
when Jessie Mae isn't home.

540
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:17,817
Hymns make Jessie Mae nervous.

541
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:24,325
Jessie Mae hates me.
I don't know why. She just hates me.

542
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:26,834
Hate me or not...

543
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:30,633
I gotta get back and smell that salt air
and work that dirt.

544
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:35,838
Callie said I could always come back
and visit her, and she meant it, too.

545
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:39,144
That's who I'm going to see now.
Callie Davis.

546
00:48:39,216 --> 00:48:42,708
The whole first month of my visit
I am going to work in Callie's garden.

547
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:46,552
I haven't had my hands in dirt for 20 years.

548
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:49,986
My hands just feel the need of dirt.

549
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:54,192
- Do you like to work the ground?
- I never have.

550
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:56,730
Try it sometime! It'll do wonders for you.

551
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:03,000
I bet I'd live to be 100
if I can just get outdoors again.

552
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:11,604
It was being cooped up in those two rooms
that was killing me.

553
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:14,173
I used to work that land like a man.

554
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:18,019
I had to, when Papa died.

555
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:22,448
And I got two little babies buried there.

556
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:25,161
Reenie Sue and Douglas.

557
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:31,000
Diphtheria got Reenie Sue.
I never knew what carried Douglas away.

558
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:35,961
He was just weak from the start.
I know that Callie has kept up their graves.

559
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:42,173
If only my heart will hold out till I get there.

560
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:47,675
Now, where do you go, after Harrison?

561
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:50,111
Old Gulf.

562
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:54,052
My family just moved there from Louisiana.

563
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:57,426
I'll go stay there with them
till my husband comes home again.

564
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:58,984
Oh, isn't that nice?

565
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:01,824
It'll be funny living at home again.

566
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:04,557
- How long have you been married?
- A year.

567
00:50:08,605 --> 00:50:11,005
My husband was anxious for me to go.

568
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:13,975
He said he worried about me being alone.

569
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:19,341
I'm the only child
and my parents and I are very close.

570
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:20,974
Isn't that nice?

571
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:25,582
I so hoped my mother and daddy
would like my husband. And he'd like them.

572
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:29,789
I needn't have worried.
They hit it off from the very first.

573
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:35,361
Mother and Daddy say they feel like they've
got two children now, a son and a daughter.

574
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:38,762
Isn't that nice?

575
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:41,827
I've heard people say...

576
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:45,667
that if your son marries, you lose a son.

577
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:49,176
But if your daughter marries, you get a son.

578
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:54,876
What's your husband's name?

579
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:58,011
- Robert.
- That's a nice name.

580
00:50:58,755 --> 00:51:03,556
I think so, but I guess any name he had
I'd think was nice.

581
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:06,627
I love my husband very much.

582
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:12,201
Lots of girls I know think I'm silly
about him, but I can't help it.

583
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:19,708
I wasn't in love with my husband.

584
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:32,550
Do you believe we are punished
for the things we do wrong?

585
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:37,715
I sometimes think
that's why I've had all my trouble.

586
00:51:39,196 --> 00:51:43,428
I talked to many a preacher about it,
and all but one said he didn't think so.

587
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:46,127
But I can't see any other reason.

588
00:51:48,238 --> 00:51:50,536
Of course, I didn't lie to my husband.

589
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:53,000
I told him I didn't love him.

590
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:56,205
That I admired him, which I did...

591
00:51:58,381 --> 00:51:59,973
but I didn't love him.

592
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:06,446
I'd never love anybody...

593
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:11,683
but Ray John Murray as long as I lived...

594
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:16,027
and I didn't, and I couldn't help it.

595
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:21,400
Even when my husband died...

596
00:52:21,938 --> 00:52:25,271
and I moved back with Mama and Papa...

597
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:29,670
I used to sit on our front gallery
every morning...

598
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:33,944
and every evening just to nod hello
to Ray John Murray...

599
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:36,880
when he went by the house
to work at the store.

600
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:41,353
He went a mile out of his way
to pass the house.

601
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,059
Never loved nobody but me.

602
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:53,034
- Why didn't you marry him?
- Cause his papa and my papa didn't speak.

603
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:57,130
And my papa forced me to write a letter
saying I never wanted to see him again.

604
00:52:57,207 --> 00:53:00,142
Then he got drunk
and he married out of spite!

605
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:19,451
You know, I felt sorry for his wife.
She knew he never loved her.

606
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,995
I don't think about those things now.

607
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:34,100
But they're all a part of Bountiful.

608
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:38,581
I think that's why I started thinking
about it again.

609
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:47,646
You are lucky to be married
to the man you love.

610
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:52,023
- I know I am.
- Awful lucky.

611
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:29,154
- You want any help with those bags?
- No, thank you.

612
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:32,330
- Oh, excuse me.
- Yes?

613
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:34,802
Is the bus to Old Gulf gonna be on time?

614
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,129
Always is.

615
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:50,077
- Honey, what time is it?
- It's 10:00.

616
00:54:50,153 --> 00:54:51,552
10:00!

617
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:54,749
I bet Callie will be surprised
to see me walk in at 10:00.

618
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:56,587
Did you tell her you were coming today?

619
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:58,628
No, I couldn't, because I didn't know.

620
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:01,596
I had to wait for Jessie Mae
to go to the drugstore.

621
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:06,959
My bus leaves in half an hour.

622
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:10,939
I see. I better be finding out how
I'm gonna get on out to Bountiful.

623
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:13,635
No, you sit down. Sit down. I'll find the man.

624
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:17,703
- Excuse me again.
- Yes?

625
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:20,614
My friend here would like to know
how to get to Bountiful.

626
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,743
- Bountiful?
- Yes.

627
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:24,716
What's she going there for?

628
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:29,487
- I'm gonna go visit my girlhood friend.
- I don't know who that's gonna be.

629
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:32,127
The last person in Bountiful
was Miss Callie Davis.

630
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:33,924
She died day before yesterday.

631
00:55:34,197 --> 00:55:36,688
That is,
they found her day before yesterday.

632
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:40,167
She lived all alone,
so they don't know exactly when she died.

633
00:55:41,604 --> 00:55:42,696
Excuse me.

634
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:47,940
- Callie Davis?
- Yes, ma'am.

635
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,876
They had the funeral this morning.

636
00:55:49,946 --> 00:55:52,210
Was she the one you were gonna visit?

637
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:54,916
Yes, sir, that's the one.

638
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:59,511
She was my friend. My girlhood friend.

639
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:22,307
- Is there a hotel here?
- Yes, ma'am. The Riverview.

640
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:25,438
- How far is it?
- About three blocks.

641
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,688
What'll you do now, Mrs. Watts?

642
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,191
I'm thinking, honey.

643
00:56:57,614 --> 00:56:59,479
It's come to me what to do.

644
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:01,942
I'll go on.

645
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:05,686
That much has come to me. I'll go on.

646
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:11,451
I feel my strength and my purpose
strong within me.

647
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:14,121
I will go to Bountiful.

648
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:17,592
I will walk the 12 miles if I have to.

649
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:21,837
Now, Mrs. Watts, what are you gonna do
if there's no one there this time of night?

650
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:24,703
Oh, yes. I guess you're right.

651
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:27,942
I think you ought to wait until morning.

652
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:31,479
Yes, I guess I should.

653
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:37,811
And then I can hire somebody
to drive me out.

654
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:41,653
You know what I'll do?

655
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:45,160
I will stay at my own house,
or what's left of it.

656
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:48,764
You put me in a garden,
and I get along just fine...

657
00:57:48,832 --> 00:57:50,493
with the help of my government checks.

658
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:51,693
- Mrs. Watts.
- What?

659
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:55,932
The man says there's a hotel not too far
from here. I think I'd better take you there.

660
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:58,872
Oh, no, thank you.
I'm not gonna waste my money on hotels.

661
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:01,035
They're high as cats' backs, you know.

662
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:03,578
I'll just sleep right here on this bench.

663
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:09,113
I'll put my coat under my head
and my purse under my arm...

664
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,182
My purse!

665
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:19,017
- Honey, did you see my purse?
- Why, no! Excuse me!

666
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:21,290
This lady left her purse on the bus!

667
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:24,794
All right, I'll call ahead about it.

668
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:27,962
- How can you identify it?
- It's a plain brown purse.

669
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:31,231
- How much money?
- 35 and a pension check.

670
00:58:31,374 --> 00:58:33,842
- And who was the check made out to?
- To me.

671
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:36,174
- Mrs...
- Mrs. Carrie Watts.

672
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:38,839
All right.

673
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:44,151
- I'll call up about it.
- Thank you. You've been most kind.

674
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:46,211
How long will it take to get it back?

675
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:48,850
Well, depends.

676
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,788
If I can get ahead of the bus at Don Tarle...

677
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:59,593
they can send it back on the Victoria bus
and it should be here in a couple of hours.

678
00:59:00,637 --> 00:59:03,071
Thanks. It's awfully kind of you.

679
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:07,372
- Try not to worry about the purse.
- Oh, I won't. I'm too tired to worry.

680
00:59:07,443 --> 00:59:10,071
Be time enough to worry
when I get up in the morning.

681
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,573
Why don't you see
if you can go on to sleep now?

682
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:15,880
No, I thought I'd stay up and see you off.

683
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:17,647
No, you go on to sleep.

684
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,688
Oh, I can't go right off to sleep now.

685
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:22,486
I'm too wound up.
I don't go on a trip every day of my life.

686
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,824
You're lucky.
The bus hasn't gotten to Don Tarle yet.

687
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:29,397
Now, if they can find the purse,
it'll be here...

688
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:35,092
around 12:00.

689
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:39,207
Make you feel better?

690
00:59:39,275 --> 00:59:43,803
Yes, it does. Of course,
everything has seemed to work out today.

691
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:48,146
Why is it that some days everything works
out and then other days nothing works out?

692
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:54,387
What I mean is, I have been trying
to get to Bountiful for over five years.

693
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:57,949
Now, usually Jessie Mae and Ludie'd come
and they'd find me...

694
00:59:58,027 --> 01:00:01,087
even before I got inside
the railroad station good.

695
01:00:01,164 --> 01:00:05,863
Today, I got inside both the railroad station
and the bus station.

696
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,930
I bought a ticket.

697
01:00:08,504 --> 01:00:12,338
I seen Ludie and Jessie Mae
before they saw me.

698
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:16,409
I hid out, and I met a pretty friend like you.

699
01:00:16,479 --> 01:00:20,609
I lost my purse, and now
I have somebody finding it for me.

700
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:23,985
Guess the Lord's just with me today.

701
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:31,586
Wonder why the Lord's not with us
everyday? Sure would be nice if He was.

702
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:38,700
Well, maybe then we wouldn't appreciate it
so much on those days when He is with us.

703
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:44,266
Or maybe He's with us always,
and we just don't know it.

704
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:49,210
And maybe I had to wait 20 years
cooped up in the city...

705
01:00:49,278 --> 01:00:52,042
before I could appreciate getting back here.

706
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:59,620
<i>Blessed assurance</i>

707
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:02,119
<i>Jesus is mine!</i>

708
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:05,017
<i>O what a foretaste</i>

709
01:01:05,094 --> 01:01:07,494
<i>of glory divine!</i>

710
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:10,898
<i>Heir of salvation</i>

711
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:12,867
<i>purchase of God</i>

712
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:16,432
<i>Born of His Spirit</i>

713
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:18,599
<i>washed in His blood</i>

714
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:22,510
Isn't it nice to be able to sing a hymn
when you want to?

715
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,911
<i>This is my story</i>

716
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:30,009
<i>this is my song</i>

717
01:01:30,086 --> 01:01:32,714
<i>Praising my Savior</i>

718
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:35,155
<i>all the day long</i>

719
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:37,891
<i>This is my story</i>

720
01:01:37,994 --> 01:01:40,554
<i>this is my song</i>

721
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:43,561
<i>Praising my Savior</i>

722
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:45,793
<i>all the day long</i>

723
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:52,168
I am a happy woman, young lady.
I am a very happy woman.

724
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:57,874
I still have a sandwich left.
Will you have one?

725
01:01:58,948 --> 01:02:01,940
- Well, you sure you don't want it?
- No, I'm full.

726
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:05,281
I'll just take a half.

727
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:10,989
- Take the whole thing.
- No, just a half. Thank you.

728
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:15,862
You know, I don't eat much.
Particularly if I'm excited.

729
01:02:42,692 --> 01:02:46,423
- I came to my first dance in this town.
- Did you?

730
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:49,357
Yes, ma'am. It was the summertime.

731
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:55,063
And my father couldn't decide whether
he thought dancing was right or not.

732
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:59,006
But my mother said that she danced
when she was a girl...

733
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:02,976
and so I was gonna dance, and so I went.

734
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:07,947
The girls from all over
the county came for this dance.

735
01:03:08,017 --> 01:03:10,713
And it was at the Opera House.

736
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:14,188
I can't remember what the occasion was,
but it was something special.

737
01:03:16,392 --> 01:03:18,053
You know something, young lady?

738
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,093
If my daughter had lived...

739
01:03:21,898 --> 01:03:24,196
I would have wanted her to be just like you.

740
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:26,665
Why, thank you.

741
01:03:26,736 --> 01:03:30,900
Yes. Sweet, and considerate,
and thoughtful, and pretty.

742
01:03:32,241 --> 01:03:33,572
Thank you.

743
01:03:35,511 --> 01:03:38,742
You better get your suitcase, miss.
The bus will be up the road.

744
01:03:39,515 --> 01:03:41,278
He won't wait this time of night.

745
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:56,660
I was just telling my little friend here...

746
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,600
I came to my first dance in this town.

747
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:01,661
- Is that right?
- Yes.

748
01:04:02,238 --> 01:04:06,038
And I've been to Harrison
quite a few times in my life. Shopping.

749
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:25,790
- Goodbye.
- I'm so sorry, darling. Good luck to you.

750
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:28,229
Good luck to you. Many good things.

751
01:04:47,617 --> 01:04:49,414
You gonna stay here all night?

752
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:53,215
Well, I have to.
Everything I have is on the bus.

753
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,623
We can't go anywhere without money.

754
01:04:56,325 --> 01:04:57,690
I guess that's right.

755
01:05:03,165 --> 01:05:06,134
Do they still have dances
over at Borden's Opera House?

756
01:05:06,202 --> 01:05:10,366
No, ma'am. It's torn down.
They condemned it, you know.

757
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:15,537
Did you ever know anybody in Harrison?

758
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:18,774
I knew a few people when I was a girl.

759
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:23,875
Priscilla Nytelle. Did you know her?

760
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:26,986
No, ma'am.

761
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:29,883
Nancy Lee Goodhue?

762
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:33,995
- No, ma'am.
- The Faye girls?

763
01:05:36,399 --> 01:05:37,730
No, ma'am.

764
01:05:38,634 --> 01:05:40,864
I used to trade in Mr. Ewing's store.

765
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:45,173
I knew him to speak to.

766
01:05:45,574 --> 01:05:48,407
- Which Ewing was that?
- George White Ewing.

767
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:52,580
- He's dead.
- That so?

768
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:57,183
- Been dead 12 years.
- Is that so?

769
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,681
He left quite a bit of money.

770
01:06:01,057 --> 01:06:04,083
But his son took over his store
and lost it all.

771
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:07,384
Drank.

772
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:09,454
Oh, is that so?

773
01:06:11,834 --> 01:06:15,668
One thing I can say about my boy,
he never gave me any trouble that way.

774
01:06:15,938 --> 01:06:17,064
Well, that's good.

775
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:22,935
I got one boy that drinks,
and one boy that doesn't.

776
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:27,942
I can't understand it.
Raised them the same way.

777
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:29,742
I know.

778
01:06:31,754 --> 01:06:33,779
I've known of other cases like that.

779
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:38,291
One drinks, other one doesn't.

780
01:06:46,936 --> 01:06:49,166
A friend of mine has a girl that drinks.

781
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:53,539
I think that's the saddest thing in the world.

782
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:54,733
Isn't it?

783
01:06:58,447 --> 01:07:00,972
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

784
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:02,704
- Come on, Roy, wake up.
- Jesus!

785
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:07,376
Hello, Sheriff.

786
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:12,011
You're working too hard, Roy.

787
01:08:15,658 --> 01:08:17,683
How long has this old woman been here?

788
01:08:21,564 --> 01:08:23,031
About six hours.

789
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:27,531
She get off the bus from Houston?

790
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:32,329
Yes, sir. I know her name. It's Watts.

791
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:37,270
She left her purse on the bus.
I had to call up to Don Tarle about it.

792
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,547
You have her purse?

793
01:08:40,249 --> 01:08:41,978
Yes, sir. Just came.

794
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,018
She's the one, all right.

795
01:08:53,863 --> 01:08:57,697
I got a call from the Houston police
to hold her till her son can come for her.

796
01:09:00,336 --> 01:09:02,634
She said she used to live in Bountiful.

797
01:09:16,418 --> 01:09:20,718
The poor thing's sleeping so sound,
I don't have the heart to wake her up.

798
01:09:22,424 --> 01:09:26,360
Tell you what. I'm gonna go over to my
office. Call Houston, tell them she's here.

799
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:30,226
Her son's coming in his car,
should be here around 7:30.

800
01:09:31,233 --> 01:09:33,292
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

801
01:09:36,906 --> 01:09:40,137
If she gives you any trouble,
you just call me.

802
01:09:41,243 --> 01:09:43,541
Now, you keep your eye on her.

803
01:09:46,148 --> 01:09:47,342
All right.

804
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:56,950
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

805
01:10:02,765 --> 01:10:04,289
Did my purse arrive?

806
01:10:05,935 --> 01:10:07,061
Yes, ma'am.

807
01:10:08,237 --> 01:10:09,966
Thank you so much.

808
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:14,308
I wonder if you could cash a check for me?

809
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:16,406
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am. I can't.

810
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:19,276
It's a government check.
And I have identification.

811
01:10:19,348 --> 01:10:20,815
I'm sorry, ma'am.

812
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:22,808
I can't.

813
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:25,479
Well, do you know where
I could get a check cashed?

814
01:10:26,989 --> 01:10:28,047
Why?

815
01:10:28,123 --> 01:10:31,286
Why, I need money to get me started
in Bountiful.

816
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:36,190
I want to hire somebody to drive me out,
look at my house, and get a few groceries.

817
01:10:36,498 --> 01:10:39,160
Try to find a cot to sleep on.

818
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:43,701
I'm sorry, lady.
You're not going to Bountiful.

819
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:46,866
- Oh, yes, I am. You see...
- I have to hold you here...

820
01:10:47,176 --> 01:10:48,404
for the sheriff.

821
01:10:48,477 --> 01:10:53,107
You are joking with me. Now, don't you joke
with me, I have come too far!

822
01:10:53,182 --> 01:10:58,085
I need to keep you here until your son
arrives in his car this morning.

823
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:03,417
My son hasn't got a car...

824
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,518
so I don't believe you.

825
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:09,428
He'll be here in a minute
and you can ask him yourself.

826
01:11:10,866 --> 01:11:11,890
All right.

827
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:18,735
But I'm going. Do you understand that?

828
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:20,101
You'll see.

829
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:24,710
This is a free country,
and I'm gonna tell him that.

830
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:28,580
And no sheriff or king or president...

831
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:31,245
is gonna keep me
from going back to Bountiful!

832
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,288
All right, well, you tell him that.

833
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:45,763
- What time is my son expected?
- Around 7:30.

834
01:11:50,072 --> 01:11:52,267
Where can I find me a driver?

835
01:11:52,841 --> 01:11:56,299
I can make it to Bountiful and back
way before 7:30.

836
01:11:56,378 --> 01:11:58,710
- Look, lady...
- That's all I want!

837
01:11:58,781 --> 01:12:03,411
Just to see it! Just to stand on the porch
of my own house again.

838
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:07,785
- Lady, I don't have anything to...
- I thought last night that I had to stay.

839
01:12:07,856 --> 01:12:10,791
I thought I'd just die if I couldn't stay.

840
01:12:12,761 --> 01:12:14,558
But now, I'll settle for less.

841
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:19,297
An hour! Half an hour. Fifteen minutes!

842
01:12:19,368 --> 01:12:22,360
Lady, it ain't up to me.
I told you, the sheriff!

843
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:24,167
- Then, get me the sheriff!
- Lady!

844
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:26,901
You get me the sheriff! Time is going.

845
01:12:27,142 --> 01:12:31,101
They're going to have me locked up
in those two rooms again soon...

846
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:34,308
and the time is going. Time is...

847
01:12:37,486 --> 01:12:39,977
- Mrs. Watts?
- Yes, sir.

848
01:12:42,257 --> 01:12:44,657
- Are you the sheriff?
- Yes, ma'am.

849
01:12:45,461 --> 01:12:49,454
I understand that my son
is going to be here at 7:30...

850
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:51,055
to take me back to Houston.

851
01:12:51,133 --> 01:12:53,693
- Yes, ma'am.
- Then listen to me, sir.

852
01:12:54,103 --> 01:12:56,367
I have made myself one promise:

853
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:00,440
to see my home again before I die.

854
01:13:01,076 --> 01:13:04,204
- Lady...
- Now, I am not asking that I not go back.

855
01:13:04,446 --> 01:13:08,974
I'm willing to go back.
Just let me go these 12 miles now.

856
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:11,409
I have money, I can pay.

857
01:13:12,755 --> 01:13:15,451
- That's between you and your son, ma'am.
- Ludie?

858
01:13:16,191 --> 01:13:20,218
Why, he's got to do
whatever Jessie Mae tells him to do.

859
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:24,662
And I know why she wants me back,
for my government check.

860
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,930
I don't know anything about that, ma'am.

861
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:32,570
- Won't you let me go?
- Not unless your son takes you.

862
01:13:35,644 --> 01:13:37,009
All right, then.

863
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:40,212
I've lost.

864
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:45,948
I've come all this way only to lose.

865
01:13:48,357 --> 01:13:51,884
I'm gonna die, and Jessie Mae knows that.

866
01:13:52,828 --> 01:13:54,591
And she's willful...

867
01:13:55,063 --> 01:13:58,726
and it is her will
that I die in those two rooms.

868
01:13:59,568 --> 01:14:01,900
She's not gonna have her way.

869
01:14:02,137 --> 01:14:05,300
- It is my will to die in Bountiful!
- Mrs. Watts.

870
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:09,834
Please let me go those 12 miles
before it's too late!

871
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:13,472
Understand me. Suffering, I don't mind.

872
01:14:13,549 --> 01:14:17,952
Suffering, I understand.
I didn't protest once!

873
01:14:18,086 --> 01:14:21,487
Even when my heart was broken
when those babies died.

874
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:25,321
But these 15 years of bickering...

875
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:28,494
of endless, petty bickering...

876
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:32,696
It's made me like Jessie Mae sees me...

877
01:14:32,768 --> 01:14:37,569
and it's ugly, and I will not be that way!
I want to go home!

878
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:52,753
- Hey, Roy?
- Yes, sir?

879
01:14:52,821 --> 01:14:54,448
- Get a doctor.
- I'm all right!

880
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:56,115
- Hurry.
- No doctor.

881
01:14:56,692 --> 01:14:58,023
Bountiful.

882
01:14:58,894 --> 01:15:02,990
Mrs. Watts, just lie down. It's all right.

883
01:15:12,274 --> 01:15:13,741
She'll be all right.

884
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:17,269
Take care of her.

885
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:39,266
- How you feeling?
- Stronger by the minute, thank you.

886
01:15:40,435 --> 01:15:45,065
The doctor said we're to keep you calm
and see that you rest till your son gets here.

887
01:15:46,141 --> 01:15:48,769
Thank you. I appreciate your interest.

888
01:15:49,678 --> 01:15:54,479
But he said he didn't think it would do harm
if I wanted to drive you out to your place...

889
01:15:55,317 --> 01:15:57,444
as long as you felt well enough to go.

890
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:00,351
Yes, sir!

891
01:16:01,356 --> 01:16:05,258
Thank you. I feel well enough to go.

892
01:16:06,762 --> 01:16:09,322
All right. I'll take you.

893
01:16:28,684 --> 01:16:30,151
Does this look familiar?

894
01:16:30,218 --> 01:16:32,812
Oh, yes. It certainly does.

895
01:17:06,855 --> 01:17:08,254
My Lord.

896
01:17:09,091 --> 01:17:12,492
Tell you, look at Bountiful.
There's nothing left.

897
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:26,095
Home.

898
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:29,728
I'm home.

899
01:18:49,624 --> 01:18:50,989
Thank you.

900
01:18:54,296 --> 01:18:57,026
Better come over here and sit down
and rest for a while.

901
01:18:58,266 --> 01:18:59,494
Let me get this.

902
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:06,305
- There you go.
- Thank you.

903
01:19:11,646 --> 01:19:13,773
You don't wanna overdo it.

904
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:15,678
Yes, sir.

905
01:19:18,086 --> 01:19:21,715
- Are you feeling all right now?
- Oh, yes, I am.

906
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:24,588
I'm feeling ever so much better.

907
01:19:25,293 --> 01:19:26,726
Well, you look better.

908
01:19:30,298 --> 01:19:33,790
I just hope I'm doing the right thing
in bringing you here.

909
01:19:34,669 --> 01:19:37,263
Thank you, you've been very kind.

910
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:45,508
What kind of bird is that?

911
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:48,173
That's an old redbird.

912
01:19:49,151 --> 01:19:52,746
I thought it was a redbird,
but it's been so long since I heard one...

913
01:19:52,821 --> 01:19:55,619
I just... I couldn't be sure.

914
01:19:58,126 --> 01:20:00,560
Do they still have scissortails around here?

915
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:01,891
Yes, ma'am.

916
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:05,797
I still see one every once in a while
when I'm driving around the country.

917
01:20:05,867 --> 01:20:10,531
I don't know of anything prettier
than a scissortail flying through the sky.

918
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:19,170
You know, my father was...

919
01:20:20,081 --> 01:20:22,311
a good man in many ways.

920
01:20:23,518 --> 01:20:26,385
He was a peculiar man, but a good one.

921
01:20:27,789 --> 01:20:31,987
And one thing he never could stand
was to see a bird shot on his land.

922
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:36,895
If he saw a man come in here hunting,
he'd just take his gun and chase him away.

923
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:42,063
And I think the birds knew
that they couldn't be touched here.

924
01:20:42,237 --> 01:20:44,933
Our land was always home to them.

925
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:51,008
We had ducks, and geese, finches...

926
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:54,981
blue jays, bluebirds, and redbirds.

927
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:58,716
The old ricebirds,
they're in thicker every year.

928
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,281
They seem to thrive out here on the coast.

929
01:21:03,091 --> 01:21:05,992
I think a mockingbird's my favorite of all.

930
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:08,958
I think it's mine, too.

931
01:21:10,832 --> 01:21:12,629
I don't know, though.

932
01:21:12,901 --> 01:21:15,631
I am mighty partial to the scissortail.

933
01:21:17,973 --> 01:21:19,736
Hope I see one soon.

934
01:21:23,511 --> 01:21:25,035
I hope you can.

935
01:21:29,651 --> 01:21:33,382
You know, my father was born on this land
and in this house.

936
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:38,959
- Did you know my father?
- No, ma'am. Not that I can remember.

937
01:21:41,763 --> 01:21:46,063
I guess there aren't many around here
who remember my father.

938
01:21:47,435 --> 01:21:48,527
I do.

939
01:21:49,704 --> 01:21:52,639
Of course. And my son.

940
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:03,441
You know, it's funny,
but ever since we got here I just...

941
01:22:03,518 --> 01:22:05,145
I've had half a feeling...

942
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:08,712
that my father and my mother...

943
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:11,889
would come out of this house...

944
01:22:12,961 --> 01:22:14,326
greet me...

945
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:17,193
and welcome me home.

946
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:33,881
Well, I guess when you've lived longer
than your house and your family...

947
01:22:35,183 --> 01:22:36,878
you've lived long enough.

948
01:22:42,357 --> 01:22:44,086
What happened to the farms?

949
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:47,026
For the last five miles,
I've seen nothing but empty fields.

950
01:22:47,529 --> 01:22:51,329
I know.
The land around Bountiful just played out.

951
01:22:52,334 --> 01:22:54,564
People like you got discouraged,
moved away.

952
01:22:56,037 --> 01:22:58,403
Callie Davis kept her farm going.

953
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:00,507
Yes, she did.

954
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:06,205
She learned how to treat her land right.
It began paying off for her towards the end.

955
01:23:06,948 --> 01:23:09,940
Heard she was out riding her tractor
the day before she died.

956
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:16,350
Yeah, it was a Ionely death she had.
All by herself in that big old house.

957
01:23:19,928 --> 01:23:21,327
There are worse things.

958
01:23:29,537 --> 01:23:31,971
Looks to me like you're gonna have
a pretty day.

959
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:33,530
I hope so.

960
01:23:36,778 --> 01:23:40,373
- You feeling more rested now?
- Yes, I am.

961
01:23:42,484 --> 01:23:46,944
I'm going to go on back down to my car.
Now, you call me if you need anything.

962
01:23:47,922 --> 01:23:48,911
Anything.

963
01:23:49,924 --> 01:23:51,255
Thank you.

964
01:26:01,089 --> 01:26:02,078
Mama!

965
01:26:29,817 --> 01:26:32,615
- Hello, Mama.
- Hello, son.

966
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:39,156
- How you feel?
- I feel much better, Ludie.

967
01:26:39,827 --> 01:26:41,158
Yes, ma'am.

968
01:26:43,498 --> 01:26:44,988
I got my wish.

969
01:26:45,667 --> 01:26:47,032
Yes, ma'am.

970
01:26:50,104 --> 01:26:52,868
I hope I didn't worry you too much, Ludie.

971
01:26:52,941 --> 01:26:55,466
- But I just felt that I had to...
- I know, Mama.

972
01:26:56,945 --> 01:26:58,469
You see, son...

973
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:01,440
I know it's hard for you to understand...

974
01:27:01,516 --> 01:27:03,541
and for Jessie Mae to understand.

975
01:27:03,618 --> 01:27:05,882
Yes, ma'am, I understand, Mama.

976
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:09,385
It's done now, so let's just forget about it.

977
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:11,749
All right, son.

978
01:27:14,796 --> 01:27:18,095
- You did bring Jessie Mae, didn't you?
- Yes, ma'am.

979
01:27:19,767 --> 01:27:23,931
Now she's here, isn't she going to get out
of the car and look around a little?

980
01:27:24,005 --> 01:27:26,064
She didn't seem to want to, Mama.

981
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:28,233
- You asked her?
- Yes, ma'am.

982
01:27:30,311 --> 01:27:33,303
- Did you ask about your raise, son?
- Yes, ma'am.

983
01:27:34,582 --> 01:27:39,451
Mr. Douglas said he liked my work and that
he'd be glad to recommend a raise for me.

984
01:27:47,362 --> 01:27:50,889
The sky is so blue, Ludie.
Did you ever see a sky so blue?

985
01:27:50,965 --> 01:27:52,023
No, ma'am.

986
01:27:55,737 --> 01:27:58,297
You know, Callie Davis died.

987
01:28:02,043 --> 01:28:03,374
Is that so?

988
01:28:05,179 --> 01:28:08,239
- When did that happen?
- They don't rightly know.

989
01:28:09,384 --> 01:28:11,147
They found her dead.

990
01:28:12,053 --> 01:28:15,250
She'd been riding a tractor
the day before they found her.

991
01:28:17,091 --> 01:28:18,524
They buried her yesterday.

992
01:28:25,767 --> 01:28:28,361
I should've made myself
bring you out here sooner.

993
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:31,135
I'm sorry.

994
01:28:32,507 --> 01:28:36,409
I just thought it'd be easier
if we didn't see the house again.

995
01:28:36,678 --> 01:28:38,168
I know, Ludie.

996
01:28:42,617 --> 01:28:45,142
But now you're here...

997
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:49,919
wouldn't you like to come inside, son?

998
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:52,752
- Look around?
- No.

999
01:28:53,361 --> 01:28:55,659
I don't think I'd better, Mama.

1000
01:28:56,164 --> 01:28:57,927
I don't see any use in it.

1001
01:28:59,467 --> 01:29:01,298
I'd rather remember it like it was.

1002
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:10,941
Yeah, the old house has gotten
kind of run-down, hasn't it?

1003
01:29:11,779 --> 01:29:16,341
I don't think it's going to last out
the next Gulf storm.

1004
01:29:16,584 --> 01:29:18,176
Doesn't look like it would.

1005
01:29:21,422 --> 01:29:24,220
You know who you look like standing there?

1006
01:29:25,526 --> 01:29:28,154
- Who?
- My papa.

1007
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:30,456
I do?

1008
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:32,797
Just like.

1009
01:29:34,836 --> 01:29:37,669
Of course, I've been noticing
as you've been getting older...

1010
01:29:37,872 --> 01:29:40,238
that you look more and more like him.

1011
01:29:40,308 --> 01:29:42,606
My papa was a good-Iooking man.

1012
01:29:43,544 --> 01:29:44,670
He was?

1013
01:29:44,746 --> 01:29:47,271
You've seen his pictures.
Didn't you think so?

1014
01:29:48,416 --> 01:29:51,874
I don't remember. It's been so long
since I looked at his pictures.

1015
01:29:54,789 --> 01:29:57,952
He was always considered
a very nice-Iooking man.

1016
01:30:00,528 --> 01:30:03,053
Do you remember my papa at all, son?

1017
01:30:04,599 --> 01:30:06,260
No, ma'am, not too well.

1018
01:30:08,803 --> 01:30:11,169
I was only 10 when he died, Mama.

1019
01:30:13,107 --> 01:30:15,439
I remember the day that he died.

1020
01:30:18,045 --> 01:30:20,605
I heard about it as I was coming home
from school.

1021
01:30:20,948 --> 01:30:24,679
Lee Weems told me. I thought he was joking
and I called him a liar.

1022
01:30:26,454 --> 01:30:28,786
I remember you took me
into the parlor there...

1023
01:30:28,856 --> 01:30:31,188
the day of the funeral
to say goodbye to him.

1024
01:30:31,859 --> 01:30:34,657
I remember the coffin
and the people sitting in the room.

1025
01:30:35,596 --> 01:30:39,532
Old man Lew...
Joe Weems took me up on his knee...

1026
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:42,433
and told me that Grandpapa
was his best friend...

1027
01:30:42,503 --> 01:30:45,165
and that his life
was a real example for me to follow.

1028
01:30:45,239 --> 01:30:48,231
I remember Grandmama sitting
by the coffin and crying...

1029
01:30:48,309 --> 01:30:49,367
and she made me promise...

1030
01:30:49,444 --> 01:30:52,504
that when I had a son of my own
I would name him after Grandpapa.

1031
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:53,638
I would, too!

1032
01:30:55,416 --> 01:30:57,543
I have never forgotten that promise!

1033
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:04,588
I didn't have a son.

1034
01:31:06,894 --> 01:31:08,088
Or a daughter.

1035
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:14,690
Billy Davis told me today
that his wife is expecting her fourth child.

1036
01:31:15,770 --> 01:31:17,863
They already have two girls and a son.

1037
01:31:17,939 --> 01:31:20,840
Billy Davis doesn't make much more
than I do.

1038
01:31:21,809 --> 01:31:25,768
And they certainly seem to get along.
Have their own house and a car.

1039
01:31:25,847 --> 01:31:28,680
It does your heart good to hear
about how they all get along.

1040
01:31:28,749 --> 01:31:32,082
Everybody has their own job,
even the youngest child, she's only three.

1041
01:31:32,153 --> 01:31:35,987
She puts the napkins on the table
at mealtimes. That's her job!

1042
01:31:37,892 --> 01:31:42,226
And Billy says to me, "Ludie, I don't
know if I could get along without my kids."

1043
01:31:42,296 --> 01:31:45,629
He says, "I don t know how you get
along, Ludie. What you work for?"

1044
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:47,531
I said, "Well, Billy..."

1045
01:31:54,942 --> 01:31:57,376
I haven't made any kind of life
for you, Mama.

1046
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:00,272
Either of you.

1047
01:32:01,616 --> 01:32:03,049
And I try so hard...

1048
01:32:05,887 --> 01:32:07,286
Mama, I lied to you.

1049
01:32:09,457 --> 01:32:10,651
I do remember.

1050
01:32:12,593 --> 01:32:13,855
I remember so much.

1051
01:32:16,130 --> 01:32:17,825
This house, this life here.

1052
01:32:20,067 --> 01:32:23,969
The night you woke me up, dressed me,
took me for a walk when the moon was full...

1053
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:26,700
and I cried 'cause I was scared,
and you comforted me.

1054
01:32:31,746 --> 01:32:33,407
I want to stop remembering.

1055
01:32:34,782 --> 01:32:36,682
It doesn't do any good remembering.

1056
01:32:44,258 --> 01:32:45,885
That's Jessie Mae.

1057
01:32:47,328 --> 01:32:49,193
We have to start back now, Mama.

1058
01:32:51,532 --> 01:32:52,521
No!

1059
01:33:10,284 --> 01:33:14,584
Ludie, what has happened to us?
How did we come to this?

1060
01:33:16,824 --> 01:33:18,052
I don't know, Mama.

1061
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:22,818
To have stayed and fought the land
would be better than this.

1062
01:33:22,897 --> 01:33:24,296
Yes, ma'am.

1063
01:33:31,138 --> 01:33:33,299
You know, pretty soon all this'll be gone.

1064
01:33:34,742 --> 01:33:37,006
In 20 years, 10.

1065
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:40,570
This house...

1066
01:33:41,549 --> 01:33:42,675
me...

1067
01:33:45,019 --> 01:33:46,077
you.

1068
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:48,755
I know, Mama.

1069
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,093
But the river's still here...

1070
01:34:03,137 --> 01:34:04,502
the fields...

1071
01:34:05,806 --> 01:34:07,137
the trees...

1072
01:34:10,311 --> 01:34:12,302
and the smell of the Gulf.

1073
01:34:15,683 --> 01:34:17,651
I always got my strength from that.

1074
01:34:18,986 --> 01:34:20,578
Not from houses.

1075
01:34:22,556 --> 01:34:24,319
And not from people.

1076
01:34:26,827 --> 01:34:28,317
It's so quiet.

1077
01:34:30,931 --> 01:34:33,161
It's so eternally quiet.

1078
01:34:36,170 --> 01:34:38,195
I'd forgotten the peace...

1079
01:34:40,708 --> 01:34:42,005
the quiet.

1080
01:34:44,311 --> 01:34:48,247
Do you remember how my papa always had
that field over there planted in cotton?

1081
01:34:49,050 --> 01:34:50,381
Yes, Mama.

1082
01:34:50,818 --> 01:34:53,719
You see, it's all woods now.

1083
01:34:54,922 --> 01:34:57,948
But I expect someday people will come...

1084
01:34:58,125 --> 01:35:01,390
and cut down the trees
and plant the cotton...

1085
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:05,126
and maybe even wear out the land again.

1086
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:10,031
And then their children will sell it
and move to the cities.

1087
01:35:12,973 --> 01:35:16,909
And then, trees will come up again.

1088
01:35:19,046 --> 01:35:20,707
I expect so, Mama.

1089
01:35:22,450 --> 01:35:24,111
And we're part of all that.

1090
01:35:25,986 --> 01:35:30,286
We left it, but we can never lose
what it's given us.

1091
01:35:37,832 --> 01:35:39,493
I expect so, Mama.

1092
01:35:43,137 --> 01:35:45,367
Ludie, are you coming or not?

1093
01:35:45,906 --> 01:35:47,498
We were just starting, Jessie Mae.

1094
01:35:47,575 --> 01:35:49,600
Hello! Jessie Mae!

1095
01:35:49,677 --> 01:35:51,668
I am not speaking to you.

1096
01:35:52,046 --> 01:35:56,574
I guess you're proud of the time you gave us
dragging us here at this time of morning.

1097
01:35:56,650 --> 01:35:59,915
If Ludie loses his job over this,
I hope you are satisfied.

1098
01:35:59,987 --> 01:36:01,716
I'm not gonna lose my job, Jessie Mae.

1099
01:36:01,789 --> 01:36:04,189
- Well, you could!
- All right, Jessie Mae.

1100
01:36:04,258 --> 01:36:08,422
And she should realize that.
She's selfish. That's her trouble.

1101
01:36:08,496 --> 01:36:11,465
Always has been, just pure-dee selfish.

1102
01:36:16,137 --> 01:36:19,106
Did you tell your mama
what we were discussing in the car?

1103
01:36:19,173 --> 01:36:21,505
No, we can talk it all over
driving back to Houston.

1104
01:36:21,575 --> 01:36:24,567
I think we should have it all out right here!

1105
01:36:25,613 --> 01:36:30,050
I would like everything understood
right now. I have it all written down.

1106
01:36:30,818 --> 01:36:33,981
You want to read it or you want me
to read it to you, Mother Watts?

1107
01:36:34,054 --> 01:36:35,817
What is it, Jessie Mae?

1108
01:36:35,890 --> 01:36:39,951
It's a few rules and regulations
that are necessary to my peace of mind.

1109
01:36:41,462 --> 01:36:43,020
And, I think, to Ludie's.

1110
01:36:47,468 --> 01:36:50,995
- First of all, I'd like to ask you a question.
- Yes, ma'am?

1111
01:36:51,071 --> 01:36:53,733
Didn't you know you'd be caught
and have to come back?

1112
01:36:54,441 --> 01:36:58,639
I had to come, Jessie Mae.
Twenty years is a long time.

1113
01:36:58,712 --> 01:37:01,306
- Didn't you know you could've died?
- I knew.

1114
01:37:02,183 --> 01:37:03,548
And you didn't care?

1115
01:37:05,719 --> 01:37:07,846
I had to come, Jessie Mae.

1116
01:37:10,024 --> 01:37:12,959
- I hope it's out of your system now.
- It is.

1117
01:37:13,828 --> 01:37:15,557
I've had my trip...

1118
01:37:15,963 --> 01:37:19,990
and that's more than enough
to keep me happy for the rest of my life.

1119
01:37:21,969 --> 01:37:25,427
I'm glad to hear it.
That's the first thing on my list.

1120
01:37:26,874 --> 01:37:30,366
- There'll be no more running away.
- There'll be no more running away.

1121
01:37:31,745 --> 01:37:32,837
Good.

1122
01:37:33,147 --> 01:37:36,173
Number two. No more hymn singing...

1123
01:37:38,152 --> 01:37:40,177
when I'm in the apartment.

1124
01:37:40,287 --> 01:37:42,585
When I'm gone,
you can sing your lungs out.

1125
01:37:43,757 --> 01:37:45,554
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

1126
01:37:46,093 --> 01:37:49,324
- Number three.
- Jessie Mae, can't this wait till we get home?

1127
01:37:49,396 --> 01:37:52,854
Honey,
we agreed that I was going to handle this.

1128
01:37:57,538 --> 01:37:59,130
No more pouting.

1129
01:37:59,373 --> 01:38:02,137
When I ask a question,
I would like an answer.

1130
01:38:02,209 --> 01:38:04,268
Otherwise, I'll consider it pouting.

1131
01:38:04,345 --> 01:38:05,676
All right.

1132
01:38:07,381 --> 01:38:08,780
Number four.

1133
01:38:10,784 --> 01:38:14,083
With your heart in the condition that it's in...

1134
01:38:14,555 --> 01:38:17,956
I feel you should not run
around the apartment when you can walk.

1135
01:38:18,225 --> 01:38:20,056
All right, Jessie Mae.

1136
01:38:20,127 --> 01:38:22,220
Is there anything you want to say to me?

1137
01:38:26,967 --> 01:38:28,491
No, Jessie Mae.

1138
01:38:35,276 --> 01:38:37,437
I might as well tell you right now...

1139
01:38:38,279 --> 01:38:42,613
I'm not staying in the house
and watching over you anymore.

1140
01:38:46,220 --> 01:38:48,188
I'm joining a bridge club...

1141
01:38:48,255 --> 01:38:51,053
and I am going to town
at least twice a week.

1142
01:38:51,125 --> 01:38:53,093
We also agreed...

1143
01:38:54,161 --> 01:38:55,458
to try to get along.

1144
01:38:55,529 --> 01:38:59,590
Jessie Mae also realizes that sometimes
she gets upset when she shouldn't.

1145
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:02,065
Don't you, Jessie Mae?

1146
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:10,138
So let's start
by trying to have a pleasant ride home.

1147
01:39:11,879 --> 01:39:13,210
All right.

1148
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:16,677
Is there any water around here? I'm thirsty.

1149
01:39:17,952 --> 01:39:21,080
I don't think so, Jessie Mae.
There any water around here, Mama?

1150
01:39:21,155 --> 01:39:22,713
The old cistern's gone.

1151
01:39:22,790 --> 01:39:25,315
Look at my shoes!

1152
01:39:26,093 --> 01:39:30,029
They have scratches on them.
They're my good pair.

1153
01:39:30,831 --> 01:39:32,526
I ought to have my head examined...

1154
01:39:32,599 --> 01:39:36,228
for wearing my only good pair of shoes
out here in this old swamp!

1155
01:39:36,537 --> 01:39:39,938
When I was a boy, Jessie Mae,
I used to drink in the creek over there.

1156
01:39:41,475 --> 01:39:43,875
You wouldn't catch me
drinking out of any creek.

1157
01:39:45,245 --> 01:39:48,078
I knew a man once
who went on a hunting trip...

1158
01:39:48,148 --> 01:39:51,083
and drank out of a creek
and caught something and died.

1159
01:39:51,285 --> 01:39:55,187
Cistern water, there's nothing like it
for washing your hair with.

1160
01:39:55,255 --> 01:39:57,883
Come on. Let's get going.

1161
01:39:58,425 --> 01:40:00,484
Do we go back by way of Harrison?

1162
01:40:01,261 --> 01:40:02,250
Good.

1163
01:40:03,030 --> 01:40:05,260
We can stop at the drugstore.

1164
01:40:05,733 --> 01:40:09,362
I'm so thirsty I could drink 10 Coca-Colas.
Are you ready?

1165
01:40:10,170 --> 01:40:12,195
- Yes, ma'am.
- Where's your purse?

1166
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:14,774
Are you talking to me, Jessie Mae?

1167
01:40:15,909 --> 01:40:17,900
Who else would I be talking to?

1168
01:40:17,978 --> 01:40:21,573
Since when did Ludie start going around
with a pocketbook under his arm?

1169
01:40:22,983 --> 01:40:24,848
I guess I left it inside.

1170
01:40:24,918 --> 01:40:26,408
- Where?
- I'll go get it.

1171
01:40:26,487 --> 01:40:29,650
No. I want to go. You'll take all day.

1172
01:40:30,524 --> 01:40:32,014
You wait here.

1173
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:41,593
It's all right, Ludie. Son.

1174
01:40:43,003 --> 01:40:45,233
Here! Here's your purse.

1175
01:40:48,375 --> 01:40:51,367
Where is that money for that
government check?

1176
01:40:51,645 --> 01:40:54,808
I didn't cash it. It's right there in the purse.

1177
01:40:58,118 --> 01:41:00,712
- No, it isn't.
- Oh, here, let me look.

1178
01:41:13,100 --> 01:41:16,695
- What is the matter with you?
- That's a good joke on me.

1179
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:21,067
What is so funny?

1180
01:41:21,141 --> 01:41:25,510
You know, I just remembered
I left this purse on the bus last night.

1181
01:41:25,746 --> 01:41:29,204
It caused a man a lot of trouble
because I thought the check was in it.

1182
01:41:29,283 --> 01:41:32,946
And do you know,
that check wasn't in that purse all that time.

1183
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:34,078
Where was it?

1184
01:41:34,154 --> 01:41:37,453
It was in here. It's been in here
since yesterday afternoon.

1185
01:41:39,793 --> 01:41:42,762
Well, give it to me
before you go and lose it again.

1186
01:41:42,830 --> 01:41:44,263
I'm not gonna lose it.

1187
01:41:44,331 --> 01:41:47,095
Now don't start that business again.
Just give it to me.

1188
01:41:48,469 --> 01:41:50,198
Look, I'm not going to do anything...

1189
01:41:50,270 --> 01:41:53,068
We are going to stop this wrangling
once and for all!

1190
01:41:54,608 --> 01:41:57,805
You have given me your word
and I expect you to keep your word.

1191
01:41:58,879 --> 01:42:00,870
We have to live together.

1192
01:42:01,715 --> 01:42:04,343
We're going to live together in peace.

1193
01:42:11,692 --> 01:42:13,887
Go ahead, you keep the check.

1194
01:42:16,296 --> 01:42:19,094
But don't lose it before you get home.

1195
01:42:23,203 --> 01:42:24,864
Come on, let's go.

1196
01:42:31,211 --> 01:42:33,304
Mama, if I get that raise, you won't have to...

1197
01:42:33,380 --> 01:42:36,406
It's all right, son. I've had my trip.

1198
01:42:38,218 --> 01:42:40,345
You go on. I'll be there in a minute.

1199
01:42:43,790 --> 01:42:45,815
The house used to look so big.

1200
01:43:40,814 --> 01:43:42,543
Goodbye, Bountiful.

1201
01:43:45,185 --> 01:43:46,413
Goodbye.
