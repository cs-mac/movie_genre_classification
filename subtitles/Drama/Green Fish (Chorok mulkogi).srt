1
00:00:03,305 --> 00:00:07,105
I'd like to have broiled rice cake.

2
00:00:13,181 --> 00:00:14,273
Makdong.

3
00:00:16,284 --> 00:00:18,411
Do you want to hear my story?

4
00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:26,590
There was a black looking
bastard long time ago.

5
00:00:28,497 --> 00:00:33,867
He received no education and
he was abandoned by his own parents.

6
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,231
But he tried to survive in
Seoul where he knows none.

7
00:00:39,307 --> 00:00:46,770
He moved sluggishly like
a maggot in excrement.

8
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,881
One day...he was so hungry,

9
00:00:52,587 --> 00:00:56,182
so he
sneaked in to a restaurant

10
00:00:57,225 --> 00:01:00,319
And ate little bit of
sushi and some drinks.

11
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:02,896
But he was found by
the owner of restaurant

12
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,329
and locked up in jail
for the first time of his life.

13
00:01:09,304 --> 00:01:14,833
Do you know where that restaurant
located? It's right this spot.

14
00:01:16,011 --> 00:01:20,448
Can you imagine what happened
to that black looking bastard?

15
00:01:21,783 --> 00:01:29,212
He is trying to build new
building in this very spot now.

16
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:35,819
He ground out an oath while
he was locked in the jail.

17
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:42,202
Wait and see what will gonna
happen to you fucking bastards.

18
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,871
Makdong, what's your dream?

19
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:02,788
Yes...

20
00:02:03,892 --> 00:02:04,859
Boss.

21
00:02:04,926 --> 00:02:06,120
Who's looking for me?

22
00:02:06,995 --> 00:02:09,259
Hey! Viet Cong!

23
00:02:10,432 --> 00:02:11,763
Who the hell is it?

24
00:02:12,968 --> 00:02:16,199
I'm not sure, but they were
waiting for you for long time

25
00:02:16,271 --> 00:02:19,399
You sure looks
better then before!

26
00:02:20,575 --> 00:02:24,602
That asshole was as
black as real Viet Cong!

27
00:02:26,648 --> 00:02:29,913
His temper was as
dirty as Viet Cong.

28
00:02:30,619 --> 00:02:34,316
That bastard grew up
only with his guts!

29
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:36,880
- Boss, do you want me to beat them up?
- Hold on.

30
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:40,285
Long time no see, brother.

31
00:02:43,732 --> 00:02:47,634
I'm deeply moved for
you calling me brother.

32
00:02:47,702 --> 00:02:53,163
I thought you forgot all about me
since you haven't come to see me
while serving a prison term.

33
00:02:53,742 --> 00:02:57,610
I haven't got enough time to go
there since I was busy.

34
00:02:58,279 --> 00:03:01,407
I heard how you've been.

35
00:03:01,483 --> 00:03:03,917
Did you quit from
prostitute business?

36
00:03:08,223 --> 00:03:11,784
Just let me know if
you have nothing to do.
I will help you.

37
00:03:12,093 --> 00:03:15,153
There is something you
have to help me already.

38
00:03:15,263 --> 00:03:21,668
I'm gonna open a new nightclub
just across the road.

39
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:27,406
And I want your help.

40
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:29,841
I heard you are a
big man in this town.

41
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:39,446
Long time ago I had this puppy

42
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:41,853
which I used to kick
whenever I want to.

43
00:03:41,923 --> 00:03:46,826
And one day this puppy grow
up and became big dog.

44
00:03:46,928 --> 00:03:49,590
But still this dog can't even bark at me.

45
00:03:50,365 --> 00:03:51,992
Do you know why?

46
00:03:52,534 --> 00:03:59,872
Because he is
so afraid of me.

47
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,713
Bye. See you again.

48
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:23,826
Sir, you know well how I grew up
in this town, don't you?

49
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:27,463
It took me ten years to
get rid of all the gangs.

50
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:31,301
I finally got this place
after the ten year war.

51
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:32,896
But this Yanggil Kim,
this asshole is trying to

52
00:04:32,974 --> 00:04:36,307
Start to ruin me right after
he released from the jail.

53
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:44,909
I'm sorry talking about boring stuff
while partying for your promotion.

54
00:04:44,986 --> 00:04:48,387
Congratulations sir.
You did a great job.

55
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:56,625
Great job? Cut it out. I worked in
police station for thirty years
but I'm only a section chief.

56
00:04:56,731 --> 00:05:00,428
Do you feel the frailty
of human life for that?

57
00:05:00,502 --> 00:05:03,232
Hey, what are you doing?
Why don't you sing a song?

58
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:04,703
Call band in.

59
00:05:04,773 --> 00:05:10,837
Cut the creep out. I want to
talk between you and me alone.

60
00:05:11,546 --> 00:05:14,014
Yes, sir. Everyone get out.

61
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:33,824
I want to die right now.

62
00:05:36,304 --> 00:05:38,670
My wife is having an affair.

63
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:47,177
My son is in college and

64
00:05:49,284 --> 00:05:52,617
We lived twenty years
together but...

65
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:55,485
What kinda life this is.

66
00:05:58,226 --> 00:06:02,162
Hey, you deacon!
Can't you do it right, asshole!

67
00:06:09,671 --> 00:06:16,543
Hurry up! Dig it fast!
Come on.

68
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:21,510
That will do.
Stop now and

69
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:24,051
Take all the clothes off!

70
00:06:24,786 --> 00:06:25,912
What?

71
00:06:25,987 --> 00:06:28,148
Take your clothes off,
you idiot!

72
00:06:28,223 --> 00:06:32,125
Please help me.
Jesus Christ.

73
00:06:33,328 --> 00:06:35,489
Aren't you gonna take it off?

74
00:06:35,597 --> 00:06:36,495
Hurry up!

75
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:45,001
You have great body there,
take it off!

76
00:06:47,342 --> 00:06:48,832
Help me.

77
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:00,478
You are a deacon in the
church, aren't you?

78
00:07:00,555 --> 00:07:02,113
That's right.

79
00:07:03,324 --> 00:07:05,121
How long have
you been a deacon?

80
00:07:05,193 --> 00:07:07,388
About ten year or so, sir.

81
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:09,463
And you are having an affair?

82
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,998
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

83
00:07:13,835 --> 00:07:16,201
You should go to hell,
'cause you are such a sinner!

84
00:07:17,105 --> 00:07:20,006
Please, help me. Please!

85
00:07:20,074 --> 00:07:24,238
Oh, God. Help me!

86
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:31,376
I know you did nothing wrong.
It's all your thing's fault.

87
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,578
This thing is a cause,
this little creep!

88
00:07:37,859 --> 00:07:39,759
This thing is a cause,
this little creep!

89
00:07:42,931 --> 00:07:45,923
Stay still, asshole.
This is all for you.

90
00:07:46,034 --> 00:07:47,695
Are you suffering for this?

91
00:07:47,769 --> 00:07:50,169
Because of this,
you are committing sin to God

92
00:07:50,238 --> 00:07:51,170
And bother other happy family

93
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:53,104
And also bothers you.

94
00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:58,039
Stay still, you asshole.

95
00:08:06,321 --> 00:08:08,084
Damn, you dirty bastard.

96
00:08:56,904 --> 00:09:01,603
Which is not an
element of this drink?

97
00:09:01,676 --> 00:09:04,178
Take a guess. Okay?

98
00:09:04,178 --> 00:09:18,889
Number one liquid-fructose, two dextrin,
three Vitamin E, four sodium.

99
00:09:19,827 --> 00:09:22,523
- Can you repeat again?
- Again?

100
00:09:23,364 --> 00:09:33,968
Number one liquid-fructose, two dextrin,
three Vitamin E, four sodium.

101
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:35,304
Number three.

102
00:09:35,376 --> 00:09:36,673
- Number three?
- Number four.

103
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:38,413
Number four? Sodium?

104
00:09:38,413 --> 00:09:39,471
No, number three.

105
00:09:39,547 --> 00:09:44,917
Vitamin E. That's correct.

106
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:53,618
Now then what is this
drink's license number?

107
00:09:54,228 --> 00:09:56,594
This question is quite hard.
License number...

108
00:09:56,664 --> 00:10:03,661
One 01-01-026

109
00:10:03,738 --> 00:10:10,871
Two 01-01-027, three...

110
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:17,145
Makdong, you look
you are a pure person.

111
00:10:29,197 --> 00:10:30,630
Who is this?

112
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,497
My father.

113
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:37,163
You two are look alike.

114
00:10:39,407 --> 00:10:40,874
where is this?

115
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:43,841
That's my house.

116
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:45,538
You have this big
tree in your house?

117
00:10:46,447 --> 00:10:48,608
It changed a lot now.

118
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,149
Can I keep this?

119
00:10:54,222 --> 00:10:55,780
I want it.

120
00:10:57,792 --> 00:10:59,521
Sure, you can.

121
00:11:10,571 --> 00:11:14,564
Makdong, have you
ever been in love?

122
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:19,268
Haven't?

123
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:24,941
Not even once?

124
00:11:32,627 --> 00:11:34,060
Haven't actually.

125
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:38,198
You've never been in love
by now?

126
00:11:43,104 --> 00:11:45,572
Have you ever kissed a girl
with love before?

127
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:52,007
Tell me.

128
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,156
Not really.

129
00:12:06,027 --> 00:12:07,460
Really?

130
00:12:10,965 --> 00:12:12,865
Can I teach you how?

131
00:13:50,431 --> 00:13:52,695
Mr. Taekwon Bae ask me
to come home right now.

132
00:13:56,404 --> 00:13:57,928
What you gonna do?

133
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,944
I will do as you like.

134
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,344
Are you coming or not?

135
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:14,113
Tell me.

136
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:20,994
Well, we have to.
Boss said so.

137
00:14:23,297 --> 00:14:24,628
Sure.

138
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:32,869
Boss said so.

139
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,036
Let's go.

140
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,570
Did you go for train?

141
00:15:10,678 --> 00:15:13,875
Why do you always leave
as you end up going back again?

142
00:15:23,824 --> 00:15:29,626
You can never escape from me,
you know the fact.

143
00:15:39,874 --> 00:15:41,774
I got you a present.

144
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,043
What is it?

145
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:45,874
Some clothes.

146
00:15:48,516 --> 00:15:49,983
Try it on.

147
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,711
Later.

148
00:15:51,786 --> 00:15:54,880
Try it on.
It's really expensive one.

149
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:56,354
I don't want to.

150
00:16:00,428 --> 00:16:02,020
Why don't you try it on?

151
00:16:40,668 --> 00:16:45,970
I'm sorry for this.

152
00:16:50,845 --> 00:16:53,040
You know I love you,
don't you?

153
00:17:13,601 --> 00:17:16,001
I think I have to visit my house.

154
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:19,465
Why? Do you have
some problem there?

155
00:17:19,573 --> 00:17:21,837
No. It's my mother's
birthday tomorrow.

156
00:17:23,511 --> 00:17:24,978
Then you should go.

157
00:17:28,949 --> 00:17:30,439
With this,
buy her some presents.

158
00:17:30,518 --> 00:17:31,212
It's okay.

159
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:32,582
Take it.

160
00:17:34,455 --> 00:17:35,581
Thank you.

161
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:16,155
Let's drink.

162
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:18,316
Come on.

163
00:19:23,063 --> 00:19:26,829
- Okay!
- Come on drink.

164
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:32,828
Here, I will treat you.

165
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:35,704
What's the matter with you?

166
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:36,834
Stop drinking.

167
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,212
Cut it out.

168
00:19:38,212 --> 00:19:40,646
If I don't drink today
when can I ever?

169
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:45,285
You had enough.
Please stop it.

170
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:47,650
What a behavior!

171
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:51,852
Do you have to embarrass
me in front of my family?

172
00:19:53,594 --> 00:19:57,894
What did you say last night?

173
00:19:57,998 --> 00:20:00,558
You promised in
front of your son.

174
00:20:00,668 --> 00:20:04,069
Didn't you say you're gonna
quit your job if you drink one more time?

175
00:20:05,806 --> 00:20:07,034
Do you want to
beat you up?

176
00:20:07,107 --> 00:20:09,473
Hit me, hit me!

177
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:12,706
Hit me in front of
the whole family!

178
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:15,308
Why can't you!

179
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,474
why don't you hesitate?

180
00:20:20,154 --> 00:20:25,353
Mother. I live like this.
Just like what you've seen.

181
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:30,185
I'm sorry, honey.

182
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:32,125
Get off.

183
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:35,065
Forgive me, huh?

184
00:20:35,135 --> 00:20:36,534
Let me go!

185
00:20:50,384 --> 00:20:51,442
Now, let's sing.

186
00:20:51,518 --> 00:20:52,985
What have you done!

187
00:20:53,687 --> 00:20:57,714
I don't know why I'm like this.

188
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,226
I spilled it all over!

189
00:20:59,226 --> 00:21:03,390
- I don't know why I'm like this.
- Get up brother.

190
00:21:03,497 --> 00:21:07,661
I can't pick it out exactly but...

191
00:21:10,971 --> 00:21:12,063
What is this?

192
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,040
What a mess!

193
00:21:19,113 --> 00:21:23,948
What do you live for?

194
00:21:24,017 --> 00:21:26,679
What are you doing, huh?

195
00:21:26,754 --> 00:21:29,518
What? Did I say
something wrong?

196
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,988
Look at him?
Do you want to live like that?

197
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,028
So? So do you live well then?
Damn

198
00:21:35,095 --> 00:21:36,392
Fuck you.

199
00:21:36,497 --> 00:21:38,522
Me? Damn?
Want to die today?

200
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:40,099
Yeah, asshole.

201
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:01,579
You guys are so bad.

202
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:04,886
How could you do this.
Especially today!

203
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,278
Excuse me?

204
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:37,950
I'm sorry.

205
00:22:57,945 --> 00:22:59,310
What the hell? You bastard!

206
00:23:57,471 --> 00:24:02,272
Dongjoo! Are we ganster?

207
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:05,308
Answer me! Are we?

208
00:24:06,146 --> 00:24:07,408
No, sir.

209
00:24:07,481 --> 00:24:08,778
Why did you do it, then?

210
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:13,180
- Forgive me boss...
- Shut your mouth up!

211
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:33,505
You damn stupid bastards!

212
00:24:34,608 --> 00:24:36,439
Don't you know who I am?

213
00:24:37,411 --> 00:24:41,438
I'm Taekon Bae.
Don't you know me asshole?

214
00:24:42,182 --> 00:24:46,278
Boss, why can't we fight
back to Yanggil Kim?

215
00:24:47,421 --> 00:24:50,618
Don't we have to cut them
out before they get bigger?

216
00:24:52,526 --> 00:24:55,518
That's the only
way to survive, boss.

217
00:24:59,132 --> 00:25:00,861
Do you know what the life is?

218
00:25:03,036 --> 00:25:04,731
Answer me, asshole!

219
00:25:04,805 --> 00:25:07,399
What do you know
about people?

220
00:25:07,474 --> 00:25:10,102
How do I know
such a thing, boss?

221
00:25:11,945 --> 00:25:14,379
They are the real
fucking bastards!

222
00:25:15,449 --> 00:25:17,815
I know him well.

223
00:25:17,884 --> 00:25:20,114
I go with my own way.
Got it?

224
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:26,452
Now, Go ahead and
have some fun.

225
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:19,735
- It's room number 503, sir.
- Room 503?

226
00:26:22,616 --> 00:26:25,278
Can you memorize that?
You have a bad memory.

227
00:27:27,581 --> 00:27:28,673
Hands off!

228
00:27:32,686 --> 00:27:36,986
Mr. Taekon Bae, I did everything
he ordered me to do.

229
00:27:37,057 --> 00:27:40,720
Don't I look like
a well-trained cat, huh?

230
00:27:41,428 --> 00:27:43,328
Get in, are you drunk?

231
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:48,934
Yeah, I'm drunk.
That bastard made me to drink.

232
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:51,334
Do you know what he said?

233
00:27:52,205 --> 00:27:55,663
He said Yanggil Kim and
Taekon Bae is all trash.

234
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:58,940
That asshole prosecutor
is really smart!

235
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,740
- Get in.
- Let me go!

236
00:28:01,815 --> 00:28:04,045
- Let me go!
- Get in.

237
00:28:04,117 --> 00:28:10,989
I hate you. Let me go,
I don't want to ride with you.

238
00:28:14,227 --> 00:28:15,057
Get in.

239
00:28:15,162 --> 00:28:20,190
Don't touch me.
I hate to ride with you!

240
00:28:48,028 --> 00:28:49,393
I'm sorry.

241
00:28:50,997 --> 00:28:52,726
It's all my fault.

242
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:01,605
You go alone.
I won't ride with you.

243
00:29:52,392 --> 00:29:54,326
I don't want it,
fucking asshole.

244
00:30:13,446 --> 00:30:14,640
I've gotta go.

245
00:30:14,714 --> 00:30:16,113
Where do you think you are going

246
00:30:17,951 --> 00:30:19,509
Come here.

247
00:30:46,713 --> 00:30:48,874
Don't you wanna fuck with me?

248
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:55,681
Just tell me. I will.

249
00:30:58,692 --> 00:31:03,652
I do such a thing for everybody,
and why not for you!

250
00:31:12,405 --> 00:31:18,674
Boss bbazie, Sieddo Samunoi bojae.

251
00:31:21,848 --> 00:31:27,184
Boss bbazie, Sieddo Samunoi bojae.

252
00:31:38,765 --> 00:31:40,232
Lie down.

253
00:32:03,123 --> 00:32:08,527
My body is not really clean.
Is it all right with you?

254
00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:14,467
Okay, right?

255
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:47,063
Makdong.

256
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:48,725
Yes? Yes, sir

257
00:32:48,835 --> 00:32:53,135
There's a gloomy feeling
going around here.
Something's wrong?

258
00:32:55,074 --> 00:32:56,336
Oh, nothing.

259
00:33:11,057 --> 00:33:15,084
Hold on.
Drive a car backwards!
Backwards!

260
00:33:26,906 --> 00:33:28,771
Stay still.

261
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:47,749
Hey, Viet Cong Viet Cong,
Yanggil Kim boss says hello to you.

262
00:33:47,827 --> 00:33:50,557
Where are you hiding assholes!

263
00:33:51,898 --> 00:33:53,957
Asshole, you bastards.

264
00:34:42,715 --> 00:34:47,880
I'm sorry about distreat boss.

265
00:34:48,988 --> 00:34:50,478
I'm very sorry.

266
00:34:52,292 --> 00:34:57,559
I think there was some misunderstanding
but I will make it clear.

267
00:34:58,698 --> 00:35:03,465
Sure, I understand.

268
00:35:06,072 --> 00:35:08,063
Now among puppies,

269
00:35:08,641 --> 00:35:13,544
Some doesn't know whether they
are from a mongrel or a good dog.

270
00:35:14,514 --> 00:35:18,507
A mongrel doesn't know what
it is and act like a good dog.

271
00:35:19,385 --> 00:35:21,444
Then we have nothing
to do but one thing.

272
00:35:22,155 --> 00:35:25,716
Then you should tell that
it's from some mongrel.

273
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,645
Cheers!

274
00:36:21,047 --> 00:36:23,072
What did you say
what your dream is?

275
00:36:27,687 --> 00:36:29,518
Living with my own family,

276
00:36:30,923 --> 00:36:33,687
running a small restarurant.

277
00:36:36,996 --> 00:36:38,395
That's good.

278
00:36:41,467 --> 00:36:50,375
To make dream come true, I've climbed
from the bottom to the top here.

279
00:36:53,379 --> 00:36:55,745
It wasn't easy at all.

280
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,789
- Sir?
- Yes?

281
00:39:18,858 --> 00:39:20,257
You didn't zip up.

282
00:39:21,427 --> 00:39:23,622
- Are you kidding me?
- Look, you really didn't!

283
00:41:22,715 --> 00:41:25,445
Boss, Boss!

284
00:41:25,518 --> 00:41:26,780
What's the matter?

285
00:41:26,852 --> 00:41:28,217
A call for you.

286
00:41:34,427 --> 00:41:37,919
Turn the music off!
Turn it off!

287
00:41:45,304 --> 00:41:46,703
Hello?

288
00:41:47,974 --> 00:41:49,236
Hello?

289
00:41:50,543 --> 00:41:52,306
Is that you, big brother?

290
00:41:53,379 --> 00:41:55,847
It's me, Makdong.

291
00:41:57,216 --> 00:42:01,949
Is mom there? Where is she?

292
00:42:05,658 --> 00:42:11,358
Yes. I'm fine. I'm okay.

293
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,564
Don't hang up.
Don't hang up. Don't.

294
00:42:19,905 --> 00:42:21,304
Don't.

295
00:42:21,974 --> 00:42:29,608
Do you remember?
Red bridge, Red railway bridge.

296
00:42:31,417 --> 00:42:37,447
We used to go fishing
when we were young.

297
00:42:37,523 --> 00:42:42,586
You know I once went there
to catch a green fish and

298
00:42:42,695 --> 00:42:47,564
Iost my shoe
so, you and brothers

299
00:42:47,633 --> 00:42:51,967
searched for the all day long.

300
00:42:52,772 --> 00:42:57,471
And Soonok, she got stung
her buttocks by a bee

301
00:42:57,543 --> 00:43:03,209
so, second brother was
making fun of her.

302
00:43:09,021 --> 00:43:11,421
Big brother, do you
remember back then?

303
00:43:13,959 --> 00:43:15,984
Can do you
remember back then?

304
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:52,522
Boss!

305
00:44:00,906 --> 00:44:02,396
Have you had a meal?

306
00:44:03,776 --> 00:44:07,212
No, I haven't
but I'm all right.

307
00:44:09,381 --> 00:44:11,246
How old are you again?

308
00:44:12,551 --> 00:44:14,212
Twenty-six, boss.

309
00:45:49,481 --> 00:45:50,709
What happened?

310
00:45:50,783 --> 00:45:51,977
Stay calm.

311
00:46:29,355 --> 00:46:37,956
Sieddo Samunoie Bojaeddio,
Sieddo Samunoie

312
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,092
We've got our customer.

313
00:49:40,345 --> 00:49:41,903
Come on in.

314
00:49:47,252 --> 00:49:48,549
Get off!

315
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:53,021
- Meal is available?
- Yes, come on in.

316
00:49:53,091 --> 00:49:54,615
Come on in.

317
00:49:56,228 --> 00:49:57,092
Soonok!

318
00:49:57,196 --> 00:49:58,663
Come in.

319
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:04,730
The place like here can be
better than any others.

320
00:50:14,746 --> 00:50:16,008
Whould you please order?

321
00:50:16,081 --> 00:50:17,446
What's so special here?

322
00:50:18,016 --> 00:50:19,278
Everything's good.

323
00:50:26,758 --> 00:50:28,191
What's youngyangtang?

324
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:29,784
Something good for body.

325
00:50:29,895 --> 00:50:32,830
That will be good for you.

326
00:50:32,898 --> 00:50:34,365
What is that?

327
00:50:34,466 --> 00:50:36,195
Dog soup.

328
00:50:37,669 --> 00:50:39,603
If you don't like it
then have some chicken soup.

329
00:50:39,671 --> 00:50:40,603
It's our domestic.

330
00:50:40,672 --> 00:50:41,798
Is it really domestic?

331
00:50:41,874 --> 00:50:44,809
Sure. We caught it right here.

332
00:50:44,877 --> 00:50:46,936
You can see if you want.
We can show it to you.

333
00:50:47,012 --> 00:50:48,138
It's okay. It's not necessary.

334
00:50:48,213 --> 00:50:52,047
Why don't you have a look at it later.
We can hardly trust anybody these days.

335
00:50:52,117 --> 00:50:53,675
So, you want chicken?

336
00:50:54,953 --> 00:50:56,113
Yes, I do.

337
00:50:56,188 --> 00:50:57,815
Chicken soup for two?

338
00:51:07,099 --> 00:51:09,465
- What a chubby!
- Good choice, huh?

339
00:51:40,666 --> 00:51:41,860
Give me the chicken.

340
00:52:24,376 --> 00:52:26,401
What took you so long to
get here from market.

341
00:52:26,478 --> 00:52:27,911
Why?

342
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,572
Where have you been?

343
00:52:30,315 --> 00:52:31,646
Nowhere.

344
00:52:41,393 --> 00:52:42,519
Was it good?

345
00:52:42,628 --> 00:52:43,925
Yes. It was pretty good.

346
00:52:47,532 --> 00:52:49,523
Do you live in those
apartments over there?

347
00:52:49,635 --> 00:52:51,262
Yes. We just moved in.

348
00:52:51,336 --> 00:52:53,668
Then often stop by
we'll treat you with best service.

349
00:52:58,944 --> 00:53:01,504
It looks nice to have old
pictures under one frame.

350
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:02,706
You think so?

351
00:53:03,915 --> 00:53:05,314
I like the idea.

352
00:54:57,696 --> 00:54:59,288
- Good bye.
- Good bye.

353
00:54:59,397 --> 00:55:00,830
- Good bye.
- Good bye.

354
00:55:05,103 --> 00:55:07,230
Haven't we met before?

355
00:55:10,575 --> 00:55:14,067
Well, I have no idea.

356
00:55:16,114 --> 00:55:17,843
What did you do before?

357
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:20,312
I worked for the government.

358
00:55:23,722 --> 00:55:25,417
You look pretty
familiar to me.

359
00:55:50,882 --> 00:55:53,817
Good bye!

360
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:56,880
Thank you!
Have a nice day!
