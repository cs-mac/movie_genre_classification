1
00:03:03,364 --> 00:03:06,822
It is already 2 years

2
00:03:06,901 --> 00:03:09,335
since our son,
Itsuki, passed away.

3
00:03:11,005 --> 00:03:13,838
To see you all who had extended

4
00:03:14,008 --> 00:03:17,910
warmth and kindness to him
at this memorial service

5
00:03:18,179 --> 00:03:21,444
should surely make Itsuki happy.

6
00:03:35,897 --> 00:03:39,128
Everybody, Please help yourself.

7
00:03:40,768 --> 00:03:41,530
Sweet wine.

8
00:03:41,602 --> 00:03:43,399
Wow, this is great.

9
00:03:43,471 --> 00:03:46,235
Frankly, I prefer something dry,

10
00:03:46,307 --> 00:03:48,036
Hey, Yasuyo,

11
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,904
Didn't we bring
any sake with us?

12
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,414
You can drink your fill later,

13
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:56,414
Come on, It's his memorial.

14
00:04:07,762 --> 00:04:08,956
Hiroko.

15
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:13,390
Akiba and the gang said

16
00:04:13,534 --> 00:04:15,468
sorry they couldn't attend.

17
00:04:15,837 --> 00:04:17,134
I see.

18
00:04:17,338 --> 00:04:19,898
They're repenting at home.

19
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:21,599
Repenting at home?

20
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:24,500
They still feel guilty about it.

21
00:04:25,346 --> 00:04:29,407
Akiba quit mountain climbing
since that incident.

22
00:04:29,684 --> 00:04:31,311
For them

23
00:04:31,452 --> 00:04:34,910
Itsuki's death is not
an event of the far past.

24
00:04:35,123 --> 00:04:37,057
Would all of you gather?

25
00:04:37,225 --> 00:04:39,716
The famed photographer is here.

26
00:04:43,898 --> 00:04:45,092
Well...tonight...

27
00:04:45,366 --> 00:04:49,598
Akiba and the gang plan
to secretly visit the grave.

28
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,578
Hiroko, would you mind

29
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:04,516
dropping her
in front of our house?

30
00:05:05,353 --> 00:05:07,981
She seems to have a headache,

31
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:13,150
Don't push me around like this.

32
00:05:13,494 --> 00:05:15,928
You're Hiroko, aren't you?

33
00:05:15,997 --> 00:05:17,225
Already drunk?

34
00:05:17,298 --> 00:05:18,322
He's hopeless.

35
00:05:18,499 --> 00:05:20,865
He drank the whole bottle
of sake by himself.

36
00:05:22,637 --> 00:05:23,865
Hiroko.

37
00:05:23,938 --> 00:05:25,496
Please forgive him, Hiroko.

38
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,181
Must be straining for him.

39
00:05:47,495 --> 00:05:49,986
He's just acting busy.

40
00:05:50,698 --> 00:05:54,896
The drinking party
will go on all night long.

41
00:05:55,436 --> 00:06:00,874
Looking forward to the party,
but thinks he shouldn't show it.

42
00:06:01,843 --> 00:06:04,209
After all, the death anniversary

43
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:07,514
is an excuse to drink one's fill.

44
00:06:08,282 --> 00:06:10,910
Mrs. Fujii, how's your headache?

45
00:06:13,287 --> 00:06:17,383
Oh, that? I was just faking it.

46
00:06:19,694 --> 00:06:20,490
What?

47
00:06:20,895 --> 00:06:25,025
You're all so full of schemes.

48
00:06:26,534 --> 00:06:29,059
Well, I'm not hurting anybody.

49
00:06:30,071 --> 00:06:33,802
Akiba and the gang
are scheming something, too.

50
00:06:47,121 --> 00:06:49,646
You don't come see us anymore.

51
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:52,852
Visiting us won't hurt.

52
00:06:53,261 --> 00:06:54,558
I'm sorry.

53
00:06:57,265 --> 00:06:59,460
I started
displaying them, but...

54
00:07:00,101 --> 00:07:02,695
I had to prepare for today.

55
00:07:03,337 --> 00:07:05,305
I only got half way through.

56
00:07:18,553 --> 00:07:21,317
We keep the room closed recently.

57
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,123
Sorry for the dust.

58
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,597
Hiroko.

59
00:07:40,374 --> 00:07:42,501
Would you like to see this?

60
00:07:46,414 --> 00:07:48,075
The junior high yearbook.

61
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:53,014
You lived in Otaru?

62
00:07:53,254 --> 00:07:54,778
Yes.

63
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,521
Where about in Otaru?

64
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,524
The house...

65
00:08:00,394 --> 00:08:01,827
It's no longer there.

66
00:08:01,896 --> 00:08:04,296
They built a highway over it.

67
00:08:04,865 --> 00:08:06,457
That's too bad,

68
00:08:09,303 --> 00:08:10,361
Look here.

69
00:08:11,472 --> 00:08:12,302
It's him.

70
00:08:13,474 --> 00:08:15,874
He transferred
before graduation.

71
00:08:16,911 --> 00:08:18,970
He had the resemblance.

72
00:08:21,482 --> 00:08:23,382
Seeing this picture now

73
00:08:24,018 --> 00:08:25,986
his existence seems obscure.

74
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,855
Would you like some cake?

75
00:08:34,095 --> 00:08:35,722
Ah,..no, thanks.

76
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,725
It's from Comme Chinois.

77
00:08:39,066 --> 00:08:40,055
In that case.,.

78
00:09:01,956 --> 00:09:03,821
Fujii Itsuki...

79
00:09:04,392 --> 00:09:05,723
Fujii Itsuki...

80
00:09:05,793 --> 00:09:07,488
Fujii Itsuki...

81
00:09:11,632 --> 00:09:12,599
Found it.

82
00:09:16,404 --> 00:09:19,737
2- 24, ZENIBAKO, OTARU CITY

83
00:10:04,418 --> 00:10:05,908
What's the big secret?

84
00:10:06,454 --> 00:10:07,944
Akiba and the gang...

85
00:10:08,055 --> 00:10:12,219
They're planning
an ambush tonight,

86
00:10:13,094 --> 00:10:14,061
An ambush?

87
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:17,127
They'll secretly visit the grave,

88
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,694
Then Itsuki'll be busy tonight.

89
00:10:33,503 --> 00:10:37,931
OTARU, a northern town,
far way from Kobe.

90
00:11:36,944 --> 00:11:39,174
What's the matter, Itsuki?

91
00:11:39,446 --> 00:11:41,880
Aren't you going to work?

92
00:11:51,325 --> 00:11:52,292
I have a cold.

93
00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:54,759
The cold this year is persistent.

94
00:11:55,296 --> 00:11:56,558
Like someone I know.

95
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:00,396
By the way,
I have tickets for a movie.

96
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:02,601
Let's go see it.
How about Saturday?

97
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,364
No.

98
00:12:04,038 --> 00:12:05,232
How about Sunday?

99
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,132
It's freezing.

100
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,002
You can't
always be busy, Itsuki?

101
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:10,873
I am.

102
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:16,238
Itsuki...Itsuki.

103
00:12:16,817 --> 00:12:17,715
The letter.

104
00:12:29,063 --> 00:12:30,223
Itsuki.

105
00:12:31,532 --> 00:12:33,090
Itsuki, the letter.

106
00:12:34,068 --> 00:12:35,433
Itsuki.

107
00:12:35,903 --> 00:12:37,268
What?

108
00:12:37,571 --> 00:12:39,869
This,..you dropped this.

109
00:12:42,243 --> 00:12:43,301
A love letter?

110
00:12:48,582 --> 00:12:49,776
Itsuki.

111
00:12:50,751 --> 00:12:52,013
Itsuki, how about next week?

112
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,000
Wa-ta -na -be Hi-ro-ko?

113
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,206
Who could it be?

114
00:13:32,726 --> 00:13:36,025
"Dear Fujii Itsuki,
How are you?"

115
00:13:36,263 --> 00:13:39,824
"I'm very well.
- -Watanabe Hiroko"

116
00:13:47,341 --> 00:13:49,138
What the hell is this?

117
00:13:57,151 --> 00:13:58,243
Who is it from?

118
00:13:59,053 --> 00:14:00,020
Letter of Misery?

119
00:14:01,288 --> 00:14:03,222
It doesn't seem to be that.

120
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,621
Grandpa, dinner's ready.

121
00:14:07,094 --> 00:14:09,296
Ms. Watanabe in Kobe..,

122
00:14:09,296 --> 00:14:10,763
Isn't she your acquaintance?

123
00:14:11,332 --> 00:14:12,390
Ms. Watanabe?

124
00:14:12,566 --> 00:14:13,362
Look at it.

125
00:14:13,567 --> 00:14:15,626
Must be someone you know.

126
00:14:15,703 --> 00:14:18,433
No, I don't know her. I'm definite.

127
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,971
Watanabe Hiroko..,
This is really weird.

128
00:14:24,244 --> 00:14:26,337
Isn't it weird, grandpa?

129
00:14:26,947 --> 00:14:27,777
Let me,

130
00:14:30,784 --> 00:14:33,150
I don't know anyone in Kobe.

131
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,613
How would I know.

132
00:14:37,057 --> 00:14:38,524
Didn't you see a doctor?

133
00:14:38,926 --> 00:14:40,757
It's not that serious.

134
00:14:41,128 --> 00:14:43,961
Those pills're
only for slight colds,

135
00:14:45,366 --> 00:14:47,300
Then you'll go to work tomorrow?

136
00:14:48,702 --> 00:14:50,260
If not, go to the hospital.

137
00:14:50,371 --> 00:14:52,464
Itsuki, let me see the letter.

138
00:14:52,539 --> 00:14:53,904
Rather work like a slave

139
00:14:53,974 --> 00:14:55,965
than go to the hospital.

140
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,444
The girl
who got married recently.

141
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:01,074
Different last name now.

142
00:15:03,617 --> 00:15:04,549
I knew it.

143
00:15:04,818 --> 00:15:09,278
She got married
and became...Mrs. Endo.

144
00:15:12,693 --> 00:15:13,853
Gleeeenek.

145
00:15:14,428 --> 00:15:15,087
What?

146
00:15:15,162 --> 00:15:15,924
Kleenex,

147
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:27,036
Watanabe Hiroko,..

148
00:15:32,413 --> 00:15:37,077
My God...this is aggravating.

149
00:15:38,118 --> 00:15:44,580
DEAR WATANABE HIROKO

150
00:15:49,963 --> 00:15:51,954
"Dear Watanabe Hiroko,"

151
00:15:52,032 --> 00:15:55,661
"I'm basically fine
but I now have a cold."

152
00:16:11,885 --> 00:16:14,285
"Dear Fujii Itsuki,"

153
00:16:14,455 --> 00:16:16,548
"How is your cold?"

154
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:19,250
"Try these pills
and get well soon."

155
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:20,826
"- -Watanabe Hiroko"

156
00:16:41,548 --> 00:16:43,379
It's pretty bad,

157
00:16:44,551 --> 00:16:50,387
My love runs on the south wind,

158
00:16:50,891 --> 00:16:52,358
Goodbye, Mr. Akiba.

159
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:54,120
Take care.

160
00:16:54,661 --> 00:16:56,322
Goodbye, Ms. Watanabe.

161
00:17:01,902 --> 00:17:03,199
How was it?

162
00:17:04,905 --> 00:17:06,202
The memorial service.

163
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:10,908
Well, it turned out
pretty well...

164
00:17:11,178 --> 00:17:12,076
Pretty well?

165
00:17:12,713 --> 00:17:14,681
Pretty well is

166
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:16,438
pretty well.

167
00:17:16,917 --> 00:17:18,976
Something good happened?

168
00:17:20,521 --> 00:17:22,489
I can see it in your face.

169
00:17:23,891 --> 00:17:24,721
Really?

170
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:30,853
What?

171
00:17:30,931 --> 00:17:33,559
What is it? You tell me.

172
00:17:39,806 --> 00:17:41,797
When I went to his house

173
00:17:42,342 --> 00:17:44,970
his mother showed me
his yearbook.

174
00:17:45,212 --> 00:17:46,304
His yearbook?

175
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,371
His junior high's

176
00:17:48,582 --> 00:17:50,516
when he lived in Otaru.

177
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:56,787
There was a list of addresses

178
00:17:57,257 --> 00:17:58,952
at the end of the book.

179
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,160
I found his address there.

180
00:18:02,563 --> 00:18:03,825
I'm sure there was.

181
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:06,495
His house is no longer there.

182
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:08,364
A highway runs over it now.

183
00:18:09,636 --> 00:18:14,266
Which means that address
doesn't exist anymore.

184
00:18:14,474 --> 00:18:15,498
Right?

185
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,544
I guess so.

186
00:18:19,846 --> 00:18:23,612
Guess what? I wrote a letter
and mailed it to that address.

187
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,984
I addressed it to him.

188
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,187
What for?

189
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,119
The letter won't get there.

190
00:18:34,628 --> 00:18:36,289
That's why I mailed it.

191
00:18:40,234 --> 00:18:42,464
It's a letter to Heaven.

192
00:18:47,641 --> 00:18:50,007
You're really full of surprises.

193
00:18:51,612 --> 00:18:54,479
But...guess what happened?

194
00:18:56,817 --> 00:18:58,341
I got a reply.

195
00:18:59,753 --> 00:19:00,879
From Heaven?

196
00:19:08,462 --> 00:19:10,157
You must be kidding.

197
00:19:12,332 --> 00:19:16,166
"Dear Watanabe Hiroko,
I'm basically fine.,."

198
00:19:16,703 --> 00:19:18,136
Isn't this strange?

199
00:19:18,572 --> 00:19:22,565
"but I now have a cold.
-Fujii Itsuki"

200
00:19:24,211 --> 00:19:26,145
This must be a bad joke.

201
00:19:26,246 --> 00:19:27,941
It could be...

202
00:19:28,015 --> 00:19:29,812
But It makes me a bit happy.

203
00:19:34,788 --> 00:19:36,187
It must be that.

204
00:19:38,692 --> 00:19:41,661
You still can't forget Fujii.

205
00:19:41,928 --> 00:19:43,828
That's why you wrote that.

206
00:19:44,331 --> 00:19:47,198
And you, Akiba?
Have you forgotten him?

207
00:19:48,335 --> 00:19:51,099
That's a different issue.

208
00:19:51,438 --> 00:19:53,599
How do you define
our relationship?

209
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,673
Hey, Hiroko...hey..,

210
00:19:59,179 --> 00:19:59,975
Hey.

211
00:20:01,315 --> 00:20:03,306
I'm serious about this.

212
00:20:04,284 --> 00:20:07,845
But I don't know.
How am I supposed to say?

213
00:20:08,322 --> 00:20:11,587
Always this Kansai accent
when you're stuck.

214
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:11,584
Oh, hi. Is anything the matter?

215
00:21:11,718 --> 00:21:14,744
I..,I forgot something.

216
00:21:15,355 --> 00:21:16,481
Forgot what?

217
00:21:16,623 --> 00:21:19,922
Well...It’s all right, Goodbye.

218
00:21:24,931 --> 00:21:26,558
She saw us kissing.

219
00:21:28,001 --> 00:21:29,093
What shall we do?

220
00:21:30,904 --> 00:21:32,462
It couldn't be helped.

221
00:21:32,773 --> 00:21:35,970
We might as well
make it public now.

222
00:21:49,089 --> 00:21:51,990
When I visited Fujii's grave

223
00:21:52,058 --> 00:21:53,753
I asked for

224
00:21:57,464 --> 00:22:00,126
his permission to marry you.

225
00:22:05,205 --> 00:22:09,904
I think it's about time
you freed him.

226
00:22:12,212 --> 00:22:14,009
Let yourself be free, too.

227
00:22:34,434 --> 00:22:36,868
"Dear Fujii Itsuki"

228
00:22:37,337 --> 00:22:39,635
"On the way home today"

229
00:22:39,706 --> 00:22:43,073
"I saw the cherry blossoms
were ready to bloom."

230
00:22:43,777 --> 00:22:48,544
"Spring seems not far away.
- -Watanabe Hiroko"

231
00:22:50,717 --> 00:22:51,945
She's deranged.

232
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,490
It's in Motojiro Kajii's story.

233
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:00,992
A body buried
under a cherry tree.

234
00:23:01,394 --> 00:23:03,157
It's in Ango Sakaguchi's...

235
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,629
Under the Full Bloom
Cherry Forest.

236
00:23:04,698 --> 00:23:07,599
That's it, That must be it.

237
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:10,602
There's a thing about
cherry blossoms.

238
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,331
Yes, you're absolutely right.

239
00:23:12,606 --> 00:23:15,268
That weird letter.

240
00:23:15,342 --> 00:23:17,003
Those cold pills.

241
00:23:17,077 --> 00:23:20,069
The cherry blossoms
and spring not far away.

242
00:23:20,146 --> 00:23:22,444
She should be locked up.

243
00:23:23,116 --> 00:23:25,209
It's scary. What shall I do?

244
00:23:26,286 --> 00:23:30,347
If nothing's done about it
she'll keep on writing,

245
00:23:30,457 --> 00:23:31,924
For how long?

246
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:34,326
Forever.

247
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,869
"Dear Watanabe Hiroko"

248
00:23:56,316 --> 00:23:58,375
"Who in the world are you?"

249
00:23:58,852 --> 00:24:02,015
"Please tell me the truth."

250
00:24:03,223 --> 00:24:04,190
What the hell!

251
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:06,982
He's the one
who impersonated Fujii.

252
00:24:07,127 --> 00:24:09,220
Suppose he's serious.

253
00:24:09,963 --> 00:24:11,487
Serious in what way?

254
00:24:12,332 --> 00:24:13,731
I don't know.

255
00:24:15,268 --> 00:24:17,532
Come to think of it, it's weird.

256
00:24:17,837 --> 00:24:20,305
Why was your letter delivered?

257
00:24:21,575 --> 00:24:24,339
You said that
nobody lives at that address.

258
00:24:24,878 --> 00:24:26,675
That it's a highway now.

259
00:24:27,147 --> 00:24:29,172
But the letters are delivered.

260
00:24:31,418 --> 00:24:34,080
Maybe he lives on the highway.

261
00:24:34,187 --> 00:24:35,518
You're kidding.

262
00:24:36,389 --> 00:24:38,050
What's going on anyway?

263
00:24:41,528 --> 00:24:43,325
What's going on anyway?

264
00:24:48,134 --> 00:24:51,797
Suppose he really does live
on the highway.

265
00:24:55,775 --> 00:24:57,106
Assuming he does.,.

266
00:24:57,644 --> 00:25:03,412
He lives in a hut
built on the median.

267
00:25:04,317 --> 00:25:05,648
Suppose...

268
00:25:06,753 --> 00:25:08,015
Just listen.

269
00:25:09,956 --> 00:25:14,416
A postman comes to the address

270
00:25:14,961 --> 00:25:18,055
but I'm sure he won't deliver
your letters to him.

271
00:25:19,132 --> 00:25:20,121
Why won't he?

272
00:25:21,534 --> 00:25:23,798
You can't live on a highway?

273
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:24,928
Wrong.

274
00:25:25,005 --> 00:25:27,303
I said this is an assumption.

275
00:25:27,641 --> 00:25:28,938
Let's put it this way.

276
00:25:29,109 --> 00:25:31,669
Suppose the highway isn't there.

277
00:25:31,845 --> 00:25:34,609
And Fujii's house is still there.

278
00:25:34,681 --> 00:25:36,808
Suppose there's a new tenant.

279
00:25:36,883 --> 00:25:39,818
And the postman comes
with the letter.

280
00:25:39,986 --> 00:25:41,920
Will it be delivered?

281
00:25:43,123 --> 00:25:45,353
It'll be delivered.

282
00:25:48,061 --> 00:25:49,358
No, it won't,

283
00:25:49,429 --> 00:25:50,487
Why not?

284
00:25:50,563 --> 00:25:51,757
Why should it be?

285
00:25:51,831 --> 00:25:53,594
The name's different,

286
00:25:54,134 --> 00:25:56,659
Even if the address is right

287
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:59,068
if the nameplate is different.

288
00:25:59,272 --> 00:26:00,034
I see.

289
00:26:00,106 --> 00:26:01,664
Same with the highway.

290
00:26:03,176 --> 00:26:05,041
Even if a house is
on the highway

291
00:26:05,111 --> 00:26:06,840
if Mr, Yamada lives there

292
00:26:06,913 --> 00:26:08,175
it won't be delivered.

293
00:26:08,248 --> 00:26:10,307
If the name is different

294
00:26:10,383 --> 00:26:12,374
the letter will never reach him.

295
00:26:12,485 --> 00:26:14,385
That's how it works.

296
00:26:17,257 --> 00:26:22,422
Which means...
He really is Fujii Itsuki.

297
00:26:24,097 --> 00:26:25,792
That's hard to swallow.

298
00:26:25,932 --> 00:26:27,422
His last name at least

299
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,832
has to be Fujii.

300
00:26:33,173 --> 00:26:34,140
Say..,

301
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:35,606
Suppose...

302
00:26:35,675 --> 00:26:36,664
Wait a second.

303
00:26:36,843 --> 00:26:38,435
Something may pop up.

304
00:26:42,015 --> 00:26:43,209
No, that's not it.

305
00:26:48,321 --> 00:26:49,151
What?

306
00:26:51,124 --> 00:26:54,719
You see...
it's him writing the letters.

307
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,958
How else can you explain it?

308
00:27:01,034 --> 00:27:04,026
That doesn't explain anything.

309
00:27:04,104 --> 00:27:06,095
But it's romantic.

310
00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:08,434
Sure it's romantic, but...

311
00:27:10,477 --> 00:27:12,172
Let it rest at that.

312
00:27:12,245 --> 00:27:13,303
No, we can't.

313
00:27:13,847 --> 00:27:15,405
No, we can't, Hiroko.

314
00:27:17,117 --> 00:27:18,209
All right.

315
00:27:18,918 --> 00:27:21,216
All right.
You believe what you like.

316
00:27:21,755 --> 00:27:26,089
I'll concentrate on
finding out the truth.

317
00:27:28,661 --> 00:27:29,958
Lend it to me.

318
00:27:30,463 --> 00:27:32,055
It's precious evidence.

319
00:27:34,534 --> 00:27:37,435
"If you are
the real Fujii Itsuki"

320
00:27:37,737 --> 00:27:40,001
"kindly show me some proof."

321
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,231
Is she picking a fight?

322
00:27:42,308 --> 00:27:45,243
She's the one
who wrote to me first.

323
00:27:46,212 --> 00:27:49,113
Send her some kind of proof.

324
00:27:49,182 --> 00:27:49,910
What?

325
00:27:49,983 --> 00:27:51,007
The proof.

326
00:27:51,084 --> 00:27:52,574
What kind of proof?

327
00:27:54,354 --> 00:27:56,083
A copy of your resident card?

328
00:27:57,524 --> 00:28:00,618
Why do I have to
take such trouble?

329
00:28:01,861 --> 00:28:02,885
Health insurance card?

330
00:28:03,196 --> 00:28:07,530
I've decided not to be involved
in this nonsense anymore.

331
00:28:08,434 --> 00:28:11,028
She can just keep on writing.

332
00:28:14,574 --> 00:28:15,472
Hey.

333
00:28:16,943 --> 00:28:19,707
She's calling you a fake.

334
00:28:25,952 --> 00:28:29,854
My God. It looks llke a mug shot.

335
00:28:30,223 --> 00:28:31,747
Incredible. It's a girl.

336
00:28:32,892 --> 00:28:36,419
So there really is
another Fujii Itsuki.

337
00:28:37,497 --> 00:28:40,159
My strategy
really worked out well.

338
00:28:41,434 --> 00:28:44,892
To tell you the truth,
I secretly wrote to her.

339
00:28:45,171 --> 00:28:48,629
"If you claim to be Fujii Itsuki,
send me some proof."

340
00:28:50,076 --> 00:28:51,668
She really did.

341
00:28:51,744 --> 00:28:53,336
Copied her driver's license.

342
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,813
Hiroko, why don't you

343
00:28:56,816 --> 00:28:58,249
accompany me to Otaru?

344
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:02,220
A friend of mine in Otaru
also works with glass.

345
00:29:02,288 --> 00:29:05,086
He's holding
an exhibition there.

346
00:29:05,225 --> 00:29:07,716
I wasn't thinking of going

347
00:29:07,827 --> 00:29:09,886
but it's a good chance.

348
00:29:09,963 --> 00:29:11,760
Let's go to Otaru

349
00:29:11,831 --> 00:29:14,197
and unmask this girl.

350
00:29:16,502 --> 00:29:17,935
She's not our enemy.

351
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,005
It's not what I wanted.

352
00:29:25,812 --> 00:29:27,370
Why did you do it?

353
00:29:31,084 --> 00:29:32,915
Well, this is it,

354
00:29:34,621 --> 00:29:35,781
It's all over.

355
00:29:41,961 --> 00:29:44,589
THIS IS THE PROOF.
DON'T EVER WRITE TO ME AGAIN.

356
00:29:44,664 --> 00:29:46,029
GOODBYE - - FUJII ITSUKI

357
00:29:49,402 --> 00:29:51,393
Hope she got well.

358
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,131
Hope she took those pills.

359
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:58,868
Hiroko.

360
00:29:58,945 --> 00:30:00,845
The letter was from him.

361
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,611
I wanted to believe that.

362
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,321
But it's all over now.

363
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:21,426
It's all because of the letters.

364
00:30:27,807 --> 00:30:29,138
It can't be him!

365
00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:31,243
How can he write a letter?

366
00:30:35,248 --> 00:30:37,182
That's cruel, Hiroko.

367
00:30:40,353 --> 00:30:42,446
You always sit there.

368
00:30:44,023 --> 00:30:47,550
You sat there
when Fujii and you first met.

369
00:30:50,663 --> 00:30:53,097
He asked you to go out with him.

370
00:30:53,166 --> 00:30:54,463
Remember that?

371
00:30:55,468 --> 00:30:56,992
I wanted to ask you out.

372
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:02,831
He had never spoken
to a girl until then,

373
00:31:03,676 --> 00:31:06,736
I should've made my move first.

374
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,877
If I had done so

375
00:31:14,253 --> 00:31:16,244
how would it have turned out?

376
00:31:26,699 --> 00:31:28,326
Let's go to Otaru.

377
00:31:33,606 --> 00:31:35,039
Let's find the other...

378
00:31:35,808 --> 00:31:37,935
the other Fujii Itsuki.

379
00:32:09,509 --> 00:32:11,409
Found it.

380
00:32:11,477 --> 00:32:12,501
It's this way.

381
00:32:21,821 --> 00:32:22,913
It's close by.

382
00:32:25,858 --> 00:32:27,587
He'll be right over.

383
00:32:30,229 --> 00:32:32,026
Is it really you, Akiba?

384
00:32:32,598 --> 00:32:34,327
It's been a long time.

385
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,231
You haven't changed at all.

386
00:32:36,502 --> 00:32:38,732
Fujii's...fiancee?

387
00:32:40,606 --> 00:32:42,039
I see.

388
00:32:43,209 --> 00:32:44,938
Did you know him?

389
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:46,711
Of course, I did.

390
00:32:46,946 --> 00:32:48,709
I knew enough about Fujii.

391
00:32:48,948 --> 00:32:50,575
It was a small college.

392
00:32:50,883 --> 00:32:53,408
Didn't know he was from Otaru.

393
00:32:53,586 --> 00:32:55,019
Neither did l,

394
00:32:55,221 --> 00:32:56,210
Yoshida,

395
00:32:56,823 --> 00:32:58,256
This Fujii...

396
00:32:58,324 --> 00:33:00,155
Do you mean Fujii Itsuki?

397
00:33:02,261 --> 00:33:03,455
Did you know him?

398
00:33:03,696 --> 00:33:05,129
Of course I did.

399
00:33:05,965 --> 00:33:08,297
I knew him since childhood.

400
00:33:09,969 --> 00:33:11,960
It's a small town.

401
00:33:34,694 --> 00:33:36,525
Are you having a relapse?

402
00:33:36,596 --> 00:33:37,995
I'm not going to work.

403
00:33:38,331 --> 00:33:41,027
Then you must go to the hospital.

404
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:44,668
Good morning.

405
00:33:44,737 --> 00:33:45,635
Yes.

406
00:33:46,339 --> 00:33:47,203
Mr. Abekasu?

407
00:33:47,573 --> 00:33:49,632
He found a new flat for us.

408
00:33:49,842 --> 00:33:51,332
Can't I go, too?

409
00:33:52,178 --> 00:33:54,169
Seeing the flat won't hurt.

410
00:34:00,219 --> 00:34:00,981
Too early?

411
00:34:01,087 --> 00:34:02,179
No, it's all right.

412
00:34:02,388 --> 00:34:03,946
Ah...yes.

413
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:07,948
Itsuki.

414
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,254
Can you leave soon?

415
00:34:12,098 --> 00:34:14,066
Is grandpa still against it?

416
00:34:14,133 --> 00:34:15,794
He's digging up the garden.

417
00:34:15,868 --> 00:34:18,132
He was even planting something.

418
00:34:18,204 --> 00:34:20,195
He probably wants to stay there.

419
00:34:20,706 --> 00:34:23,800
We can't give way to
an old man's nostalgia.

420
00:34:24,377 --> 00:34:26,868
You said the ceiling
will cave in soon,

421
00:34:26,946 --> 00:34:28,641
Yes, that's for sure.

422
00:34:28,714 --> 00:34:30,807
It's amazing you're living there.

423
00:34:30,883 --> 00:34:32,817
Can't be that bad.

424
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:35,752
Well, I didn't mean it to be...

425
00:34:38,457 --> 00:34:41,620
Hey, this is too warm.

426
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:43,987
Keep it on.

427
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:46,826
You shouldn't
underestimate a cold.

428
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:48,690
Do you know Marimo Store?

429
00:34:48,968 --> 00:34:49,832
Opposite Marusho?

430
00:34:49,902 --> 00:34:52,530
Yes. The owner there
is a client of ours.

431
00:34:52,605 --> 00:34:54,232
He neglected a cold.

432
00:34:54,307 --> 00:34:56,298
He almost never had a cold.

433
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:58,502
So we all teased him about it.

434
00:34:58,578 --> 00:35:00,273
It developed into pneumonia.

435
00:35:00,413 --> 00:35:01,107
He died?

436
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:04,081
Come on.
You don't die of pneumonia.

437
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,079
My dad died of that.

438
00:35:07,019 --> 00:35:09,487
Of pneumonia?
Did he really die of that?

439
00:35:09,555 --> 00:35:11,147
Yes, he neglected a cold.

440
00:35:11,257 --> 00:35:12,224
Remember?

441
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:14,418
Well...yes...l do...
That's how it happened...

442
00:35:16,662 --> 00:35:18,892
How long ago was it?

443
00:35:18,998 --> 00:35:20,932
Did you forget that, too.

444
00:35:21,767 --> 00:35:23,928
He was your wife's brother.

445
00:35:26,606 --> 00:35:28,198
People are easily forgotten

446
00:35:28,274 --> 00:35:29,536
when they die.

447
00:35:29,609 --> 00:35:31,076
What can I say...

448
00:35:33,346 --> 00:35:35,746
Her father died of pneumonia.

449
00:35:44,323 --> 00:35:46,257
She should know better.

450
00:35:54,233 --> 00:35:55,632
What's this place?

451
00:35:56,469 --> 00:35:57,299
The hospital.

452
00:36:07,146 --> 00:36:10,741
I should have known better.
This is Route 5.

453
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:20,657
When did it open?

454
00:36:22,528 --> 00:36:24,928
We went to different junior highs.

455
00:36:24,997 --> 00:36:26,931
I didn't know he moved.

456
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:29,224
Must have been the entrance.

457
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,325
Rattle, rattle.

458
00:36:31,937 --> 00:36:33,234
Excuse me...

459
00:36:34,507 --> 00:36:39,706
Mr. Ohtomo, do you know
someone else named Fujii?

460
00:36:40,713 --> 00:36:43,113
The same name as Fujii.

461
00:36:45,284 --> 00:36:47,149
I don't seem to recall.

462
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:55,185
Hiroko, what are you doing?

463
00:36:57,263 --> 00:36:59,163
I mailed it here,

464
00:37:02,101 --> 00:37:03,830
My first letter.

465
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,965
Mrs. Hosoi. Mrs. Hosoi Taki.

466
00:37:37,069 --> 00:37:38,661
Miss Fujii.

467
00:37:39,739 --> 00:37:41,502
Miss Fujii Itsuki.

468
00:38:19,111 --> 00:38:19,873
Dad...

469
00:38:37,196 --> 00:38:38,254
Itsuki.

470
00:38:38,864 --> 00:38:40,263
Hurry up.

471
00:38:57,249 --> 00:38:58,614
Miss Fujii Itsuki.

472
00:39:03,022 --> 00:39:04,546
Miss Fujii.

473
00:39:06,258 --> 00:39:08,920
Isn't Fujii Itsuki here?

474
00:39:08,994 --> 00:39:10,086
Here.

475
00:39:17,603 --> 00:39:18,968
Must be around here.

476
00:39:24,276 --> 00:39:26,244
Let's ask someone.

477
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,221
FUJII

478
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,654
Excuse me...

479
00:39:49,101 --> 00:39:50,295
Don't worry.

480
00:39:50,369 --> 00:39:52,496
Nobody'll think we're strange.

481
00:39:54,406 --> 00:39:55,703
Excuse me...

482
00:40:00,145 --> 00:40:01,669
Excuse me...

483
00:40:05,684 --> 00:40:07,845
Does Fujii Itsuki live here?

484
00:40:08,621 --> 00:40:09,645
She does.

485
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:14,354
Is this Fujii Itsuki's residence?

486
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:23,426
She's out now.

487
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:25,464
I see.

488
00:40:26,071 --> 00:40:28,665
She should be back soon.

489
00:40:30,142 --> 00:40:33,270
Can we wait for her outside?

490
00:40:33,345 --> 00:40:35,006
Wait inside.

491
00:40:35,548 --> 00:40:38,574
No, we'll wait for her outside.

492
00:40:51,263 --> 00:40:54,255
We're pretty crazy, aren't we?

493
00:41:03,475 --> 00:41:06,103
"Dear Fujii Itsuki"

494
00:41:06,946 --> 00:41:09,642
"I came to Otaru to meet you."

495
00:41:10,316 --> 00:41:14,480
"I am writing this letter
in front of your house."

496
00:41:16,355 --> 00:41:18,721
"The Fujii Itsuki I knew"

497
00:41:18,791 --> 00:41:20,656
"wasn't you."

498
00:41:21,894 --> 00:41:24,954
"I realized that coming here."

499
00:41:26,031 --> 00:41:28,625
"My Fujii Itsuki was a man."

500
00:41:28,701 --> 00:41:32,398
"He was my fiance."

501
00:41:33,439 --> 00:41:36,408
"Two years ago, he..."

502
00:42:03,702 --> 00:42:04,760
Let's go.

503
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:08,067
Not wait?

504
00:42:08,907 --> 00:42:09,931
No.

505
00:42:17,549 --> 00:42:20,382
"I don't know where he is now,"

506
00:42:21,954 --> 00:42:24,354
"I sometimes think about him."

507
00:42:24,823 --> 00:42:28,315
"I just hope
he's doing well somewhere."

508
00:42:29,528 --> 00:42:32,122
Oh, this is useless.

509
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,528
It's a small town.

510
00:42:36,602 --> 00:42:38,365
The station won't be far.

511
00:42:38,871 --> 00:42:41,237
"That's why I wrote that letter."

512
00:42:44,677 --> 00:42:48,238
"It wasn't supposed to be
delivered at all."

513
00:42:54,086 --> 00:42:54,882
Say...

514
00:42:57,589 --> 00:43:01,582
You lied in that letter.

515
00:43:02,828 --> 00:43:04,090
I lied?

516
00:43:05,431 --> 00:43:07,922
You didn't tell her he died.

517
00:43:11,403 --> 00:43:13,098
I wonder why I didn't.

518
00:43:13,472 --> 00:43:14,769
Didn't feel up to it.

519
00:43:17,176 --> 00:43:18,837
Death isn't so pretty.

520
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:22,342
Not so pretty, huh?

521
00:43:23,882 --> 00:43:25,349
Maybe you're right.

522
00:43:29,555 --> 00:43:31,113
We're in luck.

523
00:43:31,657 --> 00:43:34,217
"Dear Fujii Itsuki"

524
00:43:35,961 --> 00:43:40,728
"I'm writing this letter
in front of your house."

525
00:43:42,601 --> 00:43:45,468
I saw you waiting
for a cab back there.

526
00:43:46,038 --> 00:43:47,403
I dropped a passenger

527
00:43:47,473 --> 00:43:49,373
and made a U-turn
to pick you up.

528
00:43:49,441 --> 00:43:50,874
That's considerate,

529
00:43:52,778 --> 00:43:59,013
You look like that passenger
who was just on my cab.

530
00:43:59,151 --> 00:44:00,709
What? Me?

531
00:44:00,819 --> 00:44:03,253
No, the lady next to you.

532
00:44:04,957 --> 00:44:06,481
Could pass as twins,

533
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,923
"I must have caused
a lot of trouble."

534
00:44:11,463 --> 00:44:13,522
"I am truly sorry."

535
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:19,137
"I wanted to meet the person
with the same name as my fiance."

536
00:44:19,605 --> 00:44:21,800
"But I didn't have the courage."

537
00:44:22,274 --> 00:44:25,675
"Our sole link was
the correspondence."

538
00:44:26,211 --> 00:44:29,408
"And it may be best
to leave it as that."

539
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:33,345
The same name.,.

540
00:44:53,005 --> 00:44:55,030
"Dear Watanabe Hiroko"

541
00:44:56,508 --> 00:44:58,100
"I sent that rude letter"

542
00:44:58,177 --> 00:45:00,543
"because I had no idea
who you were,"

543
00:45:00,846 --> 00:45:02,336
"Please forgive me."

544
00:45:05,017 --> 00:45:06,450
"To make up for it"

545
00:45:06,552 --> 00:45:09,020
"I have a piece of information."

546
00:45:25,437 --> 00:45:27,803
Be free to
come over again any time.

547
00:45:27,873 --> 00:45:30,205
Come back to Kobe for a change.

548
00:45:30,275 --> 00:45:31,333
You speak funny now.

549
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:32,274
Do l?

550
00:45:32,344 --> 00:45:33,606
How's Nakamura doing?

551
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:35,476
Nakamura? No news from him?

552
00:45:35,547 --> 00:45:37,674
He doesn't even call me anymore.

553
00:45:37,749 --> 00:45:38,875
I'll tell him

554
00:45:38,951 --> 00:45:40,350
to call you sometimes.

555
00:45:40,452 --> 00:45:41,544
Any cigarettes?

556
00:45:41,653 --> 00:45:43,018
Sorry. No cigarettes.

557
00:45:53,265 --> 00:45:54,755
Miss Fujii.

558
00:46:27,766 --> 00:46:29,165
"To make up for it"

559
00:46:29,234 --> 00:46:31,702
"I have a piece of information."

560
00:46:32,671 --> 00:46:34,969
"when I was
a junior high school student"

561
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,737
"there was a boy in my class
with the same name."

562
00:46:39,411 --> 00:46:42,812
"Fujii Itsuki you referred to"

563
00:46:42,881 --> 00:46:44,940
"could be that boy."

564
00:47:07,406 --> 00:47:08,873
This is it, Up there.

565
00:47:09,274 --> 00:47:11,868
On the third floor.

566
00:47:14,813 --> 00:47:16,838
It has quite a good view.

567
00:47:17,482 --> 00:47:18,506
So small.

568
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:22,519
Itsuki, compared to that
huge house anywhere is too small,

569
00:47:22,788 --> 00:47:26,224
True. We don't use
three of the rooms.

570
00:47:26,291 --> 00:47:27,053
I told you.

571
00:47:27,693 --> 00:47:29,558
Maybe we should get a boarder.

572
00:47:29,628 --> 00:47:33,155
Please. You won't
be able to move out.

573
00:47:33,231 --> 00:47:35,597
You don't want us canceling

574
00:47:35,667 --> 00:47:37,498
at the last moment again.

575
00:47:39,338 --> 00:47:41,863
I'm not concerned about that.

576
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:42,907
Must decide quickly.

577
00:47:42,975 --> 00:47:45,205
I have clients waiting to see it.

578
00:47:45,344 --> 00:47:46,902
The decision is made.

579
00:47:48,814 --> 00:47:52,375
All we have to do
is persuade grandpa.

580
00:47:54,052 --> 00:47:58,989
You know it has to be
torn down in a few years.

581
00:48:02,494 --> 00:48:04,018
I'll decide on that,

582
00:48:04,596 --> 00:48:06,461
I'm against it.

583
00:48:08,033 --> 00:48:09,591
Would you please sit down?

584
00:48:09,801 --> 00:48:11,428
Sit down and listen.

585
00:48:11,503 --> 00:48:12,731
I got your point.

586
00:48:12,804 --> 00:48:14,635
No, you don't.

587
00:48:20,679 --> 00:48:22,772
Will my opposing it

588
00:48:24,182 --> 00:48:25,479
change anything?

589
00:48:27,486 --> 00:48:28,714
No, it won't,

590
00:48:29,588 --> 00:48:32,557
Then we're moving
to a new place.

591
00:48:37,696 --> 00:48:39,095
Senile goat.

592
00:48:40,932 --> 00:48:41,830
What?

593
00:48:42,834 --> 00:48:44,825
Did he said we're moving ?

594
00:48:50,542 --> 00:48:53,534
What're you looking for?
You look so serious.

595
00:48:53,612 --> 00:48:55,102
Oh, nothing really.

596
00:49:01,386 --> 00:49:05,015
Did he have a classmate
with the same name?

597
00:49:05,223 --> 00:49:10,126
I don't really know.
Was there such person?

598
00:49:14,933 --> 00:49:15,900
This girl.

599
00:49:20,205 --> 00:49:21,297
Let me see.

600
00:49:26,078 --> 00:49:27,602
I don't remember her.

601
00:49:29,247 --> 00:49:31,078
Does this girl look like me?

602
00:49:33,318 --> 00:49:34,945
Do we look alike?

603
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:36,853
Like you, Hiroko?

604
00:49:40,258 --> 00:49:42,123
I wonder.

605
00:49:47,132 --> 00:49:48,895
Does it matter?

606
00:49:50,268 --> 00:49:52,532
If you look alike,
does it matter?

607
00:49:52,704 --> 00:49:53,932
Well, not really,

608
00:49:54,106 --> 00:49:55,095
You're lying.

609
00:49:55,807 --> 00:49:56,796
No, I'm not.

610
00:49:56,875 --> 00:49:58,308
Hiroko.

611
00:50:00,245 --> 00:50:02,236
Your face says you're lying.

612
00:50:03,815 --> 00:50:05,476
Suppose you do look alike.

613
00:50:12,023 --> 00:50:13,547
If so...

614
00:50:14,693 --> 00:50:16,251
I can't forgive him.

615
00:50:19,397 --> 00:50:23,197
If that was the reason
why he chose me...

616
00:50:23,768 --> 00:50:27,670
Mrs. Fujii,
how am I supposed to take it?

617
00:50:31,209 --> 00:50:34,940
He said it was
love at first sight.

618
00:50:36,748 --> 00:50:38,773
And I believed him.

619
00:50:40,752 --> 00:50:43,220
But there was a reason behind

620
00:50:43,288 --> 00:50:46,689
his love at first sight for me.

621
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:50,385
he fooled me all along.

622
00:50:51,563 --> 00:50:55,397
Hiroko, are you trying to compete
with this junior high girl?

623
00:50:59,704 --> 00:51:02,298
Yes, I am. Is that funny?

624
00:51:02,707 --> 00:51:04,174
Yes, it really is.

625
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:06,936
I guess you're right.

626
00:51:10,482 --> 00:51:13,451
What a lucky boy he was.

627
00:51:14,419 --> 00:51:17,411
Making you jealous
after he's gone.

628
00:51:17,856 --> 00:51:22,225
You still love him, don't you?

629
00:51:24,829 --> 00:51:28,356
Don't say that.
You're making me cry.

630
00:51:38,843 --> 00:51:40,276
"How are you?"

631
00:51:40,845 --> 00:51:44,838
"The Fujii Itsuki you mentioned
and my Fujii Itsuki "

632
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:47,616
"were the same person."

633
00:51:48,954 --> 00:51:51,149
"I found your address"

634
00:51:51,256 --> 00:51:54,453
"In his junior high yearbook."

635
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:59,023
"It's all because
I'm such a flake."

636
00:51:59,531 --> 00:52:01,123
"I'm really sorry."

637
00:52:02,434 --> 00:52:03,696
"I know..."

638
00:52:04,269 --> 00:52:07,102
"I know
I've caused you enough trouble"

639
00:52:07,172 --> 00:52:10,609
"but could I ask a favor of you?"

640
00:52:10,609 --> 00:52:13,942
"If there is anything
you remember about him"

641
00:52:14,012 --> 00:52:16,173
"would you let me know?"

642
00:52:16,348 --> 00:52:19,943
I remember him very well.

643
00:52:20,018 --> 00:52:22,111
"Dear Watanabe Hiroko"

644
00:52:23,088 --> 00:52:26,114
"I do remember
a lot of things about him."

645
00:52:27,826 --> 00:52:30,454
"But most of my memories"

646
00:52:30,528 --> 00:52:32,826
"are about our names"

647
00:52:33,064 --> 00:52:35,965
"I'm sure you have
an idea what they are."

648
00:52:36,234 --> 00:52:40,568
"Sorry to say they are not
very pleasant memories."

649
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:44,234
"It began on the 1st day
of the school year."

650
00:52:54,286 --> 00:52:55,548
Shoji Katsutoshi.

651
00:52:55,654 --> 00:52:56,484
Here.

652
00:52:56,721 --> 00:52:57,915
Tanaka Kyosuke.

653
00:52:58,023 --> 00:52:58,921
Here.

654
00:53:00,358 --> 00:53:01,723
Hattori Kazutomo.

655
00:53:01,793 --> 00:53:02,691
Here.

656
00:53:03,161 --> 00:53:04,458
Fujii Itsuki.

657
00:53:04,529 --> 00:53:05,496
- -Here.
- -Here.

658
00:53:11,603 --> 00:53:12,627
Same name?

659
00:53:13,605 --> 00:53:15,072
It's incredible.

660
00:53:16,274 --> 00:53:18,003
Muraoka Shinobu.

661
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:19,534
Muraoka.

662
00:53:19,611 --> 00:53:22,273
"My junior high school period"

663
00:53:22,347 --> 00:53:24,281
"had such a bad start."

664
00:53:24,349 --> 00:53:27,682
"Because of him, I had to
endure 3 depressive years"

665
00:53:27,786 --> 00:53:30,380
"filled with unfair prejudice."

666
00:53:30,855 --> 00:53:33,016
"When I was on day duty..."

667
00:53:46,037 --> 00:53:50,235
Fujii, who's on
day duty tomorrow?

668
00:53:50,642 --> 00:53:52,576
Muraoka and Funabashi.

669
00:53:55,046 --> 00:53:57,276
What did we do in Math today?

670
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:00,042
Equations.

671
00:54:00,352 --> 00:54:01,649
Which equations?

672
00:54:01,786 --> 00:54:03,083
Fujii Itsuki.

673
00:54:03,188 --> 00:54:06,351
You love birds having fun?

674
00:54:06,691 --> 00:54:08,158
Sorry for the intrusion.

675
00:54:08,226 --> 00:54:10,091
Love is wonderful, isn't it?

676
00:54:12,731 --> 00:54:14,392
Simultaneous equations.

677
00:54:15,867 --> 00:54:16,856
Thanks.

678
00:54:17,936 --> 00:54:20,837
"I thought all this hassle
was only for a year."

679
00:54:20,905 --> 00:54:25,365
"But we ended up
in the same class for 3 years."

680
00:54:26,244 --> 00:54:28,838
"It may sound fun
for an outsider"

681
00:54:28,947 --> 00:54:31,916
"But not
when you're a part of it."

682
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:34,380
"We somehow avoided each other"

683
00:54:34,652 --> 00:54:37,177
"and didn't talk much, either."

684
00:54:42,627 --> 00:54:43,855
What's new since then?

685
00:54:44,529 --> 00:54:45,621
The letter.

686
00:54:46,097 --> 00:54:48,657
Well, on and off.

687
00:54:49,067 --> 00:54:50,728
What do you mean on and off ?

688
00:54:52,771 --> 00:54:55,205
"Dear Fujii Itsuki"

689
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,799
"How did he take it?"

690
00:54:58,276 --> 00:55:00,301
"Having the same name"

691
00:55:00,378 --> 00:55:03,472
"didn't he feel
you two were bound by destiny?"

692
00:55:06,918 --> 00:55:08,749
"That was out of question."

693
00:55:09,254 --> 00:55:12,655
"You may think
there was a romantic flavoring"

694
00:55:12,824 --> 00:55:16,157
"but reality had
no such tenderness."

695
00:55:16,694 --> 00:55:18,787
"Because of our names"

696
00:55:18,863 --> 00:55:21,855
"we were constantly
exposed to mockery and torture."

697
00:55:22,233 --> 00:55:26,602
"For 3 years, we never had
even a single moment of peace."

698
00:55:26,805 --> 00:55:30,070
"The class officers' election"

699
00:55:30,341 --> 00:55:32,866
"was almost a nightmare."

700
00:55:32,944 --> 00:55:34,070
Endo,

701
00:55:35,747 --> 00:55:37,806
"Among the ballots
was this ridiculous graffiti."

702
00:55:38,483 --> 00:55:40,144
FUJII ITSUKI * FUJII ITSUKI

703
00:55:40,919 --> 00:55:45,219
"When they counted the ballots,
Inaba kindly read it out."

704
00:55:45,657 --> 00:55:48,057
Fujii Itsuki...
heart...Fujii Itsuki.

705
00:55:55,834 --> 00:55:58,098
"And it didn't end there."

706
00:55:58,369 --> 00:56:00,200
"After the officers' election"

707
00:56:00,271 --> 00:56:02,171
"came the special committees."

708
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,969
"Like the radio committee."

709
00:56:04,042 --> 00:56:06,374
"First was the library committee."

710
00:56:07,045 --> 00:56:09,036
"I sensed something bad."

711
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:23,420
The Fujii Itsuki couple
will be in the library committee.

712
00:56:31,202 --> 00:56:34,694
Hey, look at her. She's crying.

713
00:56:39,711 --> 00:56:40,871
She's crying.

714
00:56:41,279 --> 00:56:41,870
Really?

715
00:56:41,946 --> 00:56:42,503
She is.

716
00:56:54,092 --> 00:56:55,719
What's wrong with him?

717
00:56:57,262 --> 00:57:01,198
Love is indestructible.

718
00:57:05,603 --> 00:57:06,592
You heard that?

719
00:57:06,804 --> 00:57:07,771
Sorry.

720
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,800
It's a joke.

721
00:57:10,942 --> 00:57:15,003
Hey, hey, hey. Hold it. Hold it.
No big deal. It's no big deal.

722
00:57:17,248 --> 00:57:18,215
Stop it,

723
00:57:18,283 --> 00:57:19,511
You bastard.

724
00:57:19,584 --> 00:57:22,178
Stop it, Fujii.

725
00:57:22,887 --> 00:57:24,980
Fujii, let him go.

726
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:26,957
Stop it,

727
00:57:27,292 --> 00:57:28,987
Everybody, stop them.

728
00:57:29,994 --> 00:57:31,825
Stop it, Fujii.

729
00:57:37,869 --> 00:57:39,803
"Despite his resistance"

730
00:57:39,871 --> 00:57:42,999
"we were both sent to the library."

731
00:57:43,675 --> 00:57:46,075
"But he just goofed around"

732
00:57:46,144 --> 00:57:48,476
"and didn't do any work."

733
00:57:49,814 --> 00:57:51,111
Fujii...

734
00:57:53,284 --> 00:57:55,445
make yourself useful.

735
00:58:42,333 --> 00:58:44,858
"He kept on borrowing books."

736
00:58:44,936 --> 00:58:47,803
"Like biography of Konyo Aoki"

737
00:58:47,872 --> 00:58:50,534
"or Mallarme's poetry."

738
00:58:51,175 --> 00:58:54,440
"He borrowed books
no one else would"

739
00:58:54,512 --> 00:58:55,843
You're reading these?

740
00:58:56,014 --> 00:58:57,345
Of course not.

741
00:59:00,018 --> 00:59:04,182
FUJII ITSUKI

742
00:59:06,658 --> 00:59:09,218
Fujii Itsuki Straight Flash.

743
00:59:10,528 --> 00:59:13,520
"He only enjoyed writing his name"

744
00:59:13,598 --> 00:59:16,829
"on blank cards
with no other names."

745
00:59:19,003 --> 00:59:21,198
"I was appalled and said..."

746
00:59:21,272 --> 00:59:22,739
What a jerk.

747
00:59:26,244 --> 00:59:30,704
"But he really seemed to
enjoy this mischief."

748
00:59:30,782 --> 00:59:33,046
"And he kept at it."

749
00:59:37,588 --> 00:59:39,249
"Anyway, he was pretty weird."

750
00:59:41,192 --> 00:59:43,524
"Dear Fujii Itsuki"

751
00:59:44,095 --> 00:59:46,495
"I truly appreciate your letter."

752
00:59:47,331 --> 00:59:50,061
"Itsuki who lives in your memory"

753
00:59:50,234 --> 00:59:53,465
"naturally is not the man I know."

754
00:59:54,272 --> 00:59:56,331
"But it's him all the same."

755
00:59:56,607 --> 00:59:59,235
"There must be many places"

756
00:59:59,310 --> 01:00:01,073
"and times he was in."

757
01:00:01,746 --> 01:00:05,182
"I probably know
only a portion of him."

758
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:07,613
"Reading your letter"

759
01:00:07,719 --> 01:00:09,778
"I felt that way."

760
01:00:11,055 --> 01:00:14,491
"Please tell me more about him."

761
01:00:15,526 --> 01:00:17,994
"Share your memories with me."

762
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:21,091
The quickest way may be

763
01:00:21,165 --> 01:00:24,726
to take out my brain
and send it to her.

764
01:00:30,308 --> 01:00:33,539
"I think it was during
our 2nd-year term exams."

765
01:00:33,611 --> 01:00:35,101
"Getting my answer sheet"

766
01:00:35,179 --> 01:00:38,114
"I got the biggest shock
of my life."

767
01:00:38,182 --> 01:00:39,274
Hatsuse.

768
01:00:41,552 --> 01:00:43,042
"27 points."

769
01:00:43,554 --> 01:00:47,115
"Those figures haunt me
even to this day."

770
01:00:47,492 --> 01:00:48,959
"I looked carefully."

771
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:51,654
"The answer sheet wasn't mine,"

772
01:00:52,463 --> 01:00:57,093
"The one he was
doodling on in the back"

773
01:00:57,168 --> 01:00:59,136
"was, in fact, my paper."

774
01:00:59,203 --> 01:01:02,070
"That was the beginning
of a long day."

775
01:01:07,044 --> 01:01:09,012
"Give me back my answer sheet. "

776
01:01:11,816 --> 01:01:14,284
"Because I couldn't say that"

777
01:01:14,385 --> 01:01:17,286
"the misery was
extended to after school,"

778
01:01:17,688 --> 01:01:20,248
Kazumi wants to...

779
01:01:20,358 --> 01:01:23,122
Kazumi wants to go out with you.

780
01:01:23,194 --> 01:01:26,686
We can start out as friends.

781
01:01:36,607 --> 01:01:39,098
You good-for-nothing jock.

782
01:01:44,448 --> 01:01:46,143
Forget about that jerk.

783
01:01:53,758 --> 01:01:56,818
"The blcycle park those days was"

784
01:01:56,894 --> 01:01:58,828
"the meeting spot for lovers."

785
01:02:03,267 --> 01:02:04,700
That's Fujii.

786
01:02:06,204 --> 01:02:07,296
Gee whiz.

787
01:02:07,371 --> 01:02:09,066
What a surprise.

788
01:02:26,524 --> 01:02:30,392
"It was Oikawa Sanae
from the next class."

789
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:34,423
Waiting for someone, too?

790
01:02:45,176 --> 01:02:47,076
Life's tough, huh?

791
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:54,218
Boys are so selfish.

792
01:02:56,687 --> 01:02:58,279
Don't you agree?

793
01:03:16,807 --> 01:03:19,332
Go ahead...use this.

794
01:03:20,678 --> 01:03:21,975
Thank you.

795
01:03:30,821 --> 01:03:31,788
But...

796
01:03:32,089 --> 01:03:37,117
But girls may be more selfish.

797
01:03:45,503 --> 01:03:46,697
Good luck,

798
01:03:47,371 --> 01:03:48,463
Bye.

799
01:03:57,148 --> 01:03:59,708
"Brief as it was
I lost a companion."

800
01:03:59,984 --> 01:04:03,943
"Alone again, I waited for him."

801
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:21,062
Hey, Fujii,

802
01:04:21,505 --> 01:04:24,269
You've got my answer sheet.

803
01:04:26,510 --> 01:04:28,910
Isn't this yours?

804
01:04:35,052 --> 01:04:36,883
It's dark. I can't see.

805
01:04:44,428 --> 01:04:46,419
Would you hurry up.

806
01:04:46,497 --> 01:04:48,362
My hands are getting tired.

807
01:04:49,367 --> 01:04:55,101
The past tense of break is broke.

808
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:57,371
Hey.

809
01:04:57,441 --> 01:05:00,069
This is no time
to correct your paper.

810
01:05:01,012 --> 01:05:02,445
I can't see.

811
01:05:23,067 --> 01:05:24,364
Found it.

812
01:05:31,842 --> 01:05:33,207
What is this?

813
01:05:35,713 --> 01:05:37,476
It's disgusting.

814
01:05:38,082 --> 01:05:41,483
"I found that answer sheet,
so I'll send it to you."

815
01:05:41,619 --> 01:05:44,554
"He drew that thing in the back."

816
01:05:46,490 --> 01:05:48,754
"Dear Fujii Itsuki"

817
01:05:48,926 --> 01:05:52,418
"I'll treasure
the answer sheet you sent me."

818
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:54,122
"Thank you."

819
01:05:54,832 --> 01:05:58,666
"By the way,
what kind of girl did he like?"

820
01:05:59,003 --> 01:06:03,064
"Do you happen to know
who was his first love?"

821
01:06:04,208 --> 01:06:06,369
"Dear Watanabe Hiroko"

822
01:06:06,777 --> 01:06:09,541
"I do not know the details"

823
01:06:09,613 --> 01:06:11,080
"of his personal life."

824
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:16,881
But I remember
he was quite popular.

825
01:06:17,188 --> 01:06:19,486
"Do you remember Oikawa Sanae?"

826
01:06:19,557 --> 01:06:22,048
"She got me into trouble."

827
01:06:22,126 --> 01:06:23,616
Itsuki.

828
01:06:24,929 --> 01:06:28,262
Do you know who
Fujii is going out with?

829
01:06:28,332 --> 01:06:30,596
How should I know?

830
01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:33,994
Really?

831
01:06:34,572 --> 01:06:36,039
What does that mean?

832
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:39,605
Well, you seem to be
chummy with him.

833
01:06:39,677 --> 01:06:41,508
You must be kidding.

834
01:06:41,579 --> 01:06:43,513
Why should I be?

835
01:06:44,081 --> 01:06:47,050
Don't you feel
anything for him?

836
01:06:47,451 --> 01:06:51,319
I could be
a matchmaker for you two.

837
01:06:51,422 --> 01:06:53,049
No, thank you.

838
01:07:00,231 --> 01:07:01,425
Get into pairs.

839
01:07:01,499 --> 01:07:03,729
Start the back-to-back
calisthenics.

840
01:07:10,007 --> 01:07:13,204
So you really weren't
going out with him.

841
01:07:13,277 --> 01:07:15,302
Didn't I say so,

842
01:07:17,047 --> 01:07:18,981
I asked him directly.

843
01:07:21,619 --> 01:07:26,613
I was ready to be
your matchmaker.

844
01:07:27,791 --> 01:07:30,259
It's such a pity.

845
01:07:30,928 --> 01:07:32,259
In that case

846
01:07:33,197 --> 01:07:38,225
it's your turn to be
the matchmaker for me.

847
01:07:39,403 --> 01:07:40,893
What do you mean?

848
01:07:42,973 --> 01:07:44,406
I want you to be

849
01:07:44,475 --> 01:07:46,443
a go-between for him and me.

850
01:07:47,912 --> 01:07:49,777
What're you saying?

851
01:07:53,083 --> 01:07:54,414
Don't you think

852
01:07:56,153 --> 01:07:58,678
I'm pretty unpredictable?

853
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:29,077
Oikawa Sanae wants
to be friends with you.

854
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:31,847
Is that so.

855
01:08:32,489 --> 01:08:33,478
Isn't it great?

856
01:08:33,557 --> 01:08:34,717
Really.

857
01:08:34,792 --> 01:08:36,760
What're you going to do?

858
01:08:37,561 --> 01:08:39,654
Nothing...really.

859
01:08:40,598 --> 01:08:41,587
Don't you like her?

860
01:08:49,006 --> 01:08:51,133
Is there someone else?

861
01:08:59,149 --> 01:09:00,138
Isn't there?

862
01:09:01,752 --> 01:09:02,741
There isn't.

863
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:04,685
Then say yes.

864
01:09:12,196 --> 01:09:13,686
Hey, wait a minute.

865
01:09:13,764 --> 01:09:16,358
Let me catch my breath first.

866
01:09:16,467 --> 01:09:17,957
Wait a minute.

867
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:23,272
Wait, wait.

868
01:09:30,281 --> 01:09:32,841
You don't need to
come any further.

869
01:10:11,322 --> 01:10:14,917
A boy and girl story
is a repetition of this.

870
01:10:20,164 --> 01:10:21,096
"So I can say"

871
01:10:21,165 --> 01:10:24,760
"that Sanae was not
his girlfriend."

872
01:10:25,502 --> 01:10:26,093
"Anyway"

873
01:10:26,203 --> 01:10:30,401
"he was so unfriendly
he didn't deserve a girlfriend."

874
01:10:30,474 --> 01:10:34,570
"Sorry. This was what I
thought of him in those days."

875
01:10:57,401 --> 01:11:00,165
"Dear Watanabe Hiroko.
I have a question."

876
01:11:00,604 --> 01:11:03,505
"What did you see in him?"

877
01:11:04,241 --> 01:11:06,368
Sorry to keep you waiting.

878
01:11:06,844 --> 01:11:09,074
Mr. Akiba will soon be here.

879
01:11:15,519 --> 01:11:16,781
Miss Watanabe.

880
01:11:17,221 --> 01:11:21,021
I was in love with Mr, Akiba.

881
01:11:22,893 --> 01:11:25,418
I gave him up because of you.

882
01:11:25,496 --> 01:11:27,760
I like you, too.

883
01:11:31,635 --> 01:11:34,536
Please make Mr. Akiba happy.

884
01:11:35,472 --> 01:11:36,302
No...

885
01:11:36,707 --> 01:11:40,108
He should make you happy.

886
01:11:41,211 --> 01:11:43,372
I'll tell him that.

887
01:11:49,453 --> 01:11:52,422
Mr. Akiba, Miss Watanabe
has been waiting for you.

888
01:11:52,656 --> 01:11:58,458
The blue wind

889
01:11:59,530 --> 01:12:02,897
come and run

890
01:12:03,634 --> 01:12:07,161
to that island.

891
01:12:08,639 --> 01:12:14,009
Say...why don't we go
to that mountain once.

892
01:12:19,850 --> 01:12:23,581
Let's go talk to him,

893
01:12:25,055 --> 01:12:26,113
Let's do it.

894
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:45,070
Help me out here.

895
01:12:45,142 --> 01:12:47,576
Don't feel good. Count me out.

896
01:12:47,811 --> 01:12:50,211
That cold sure is persistent.

897
01:12:52,349 --> 01:12:55,216
"Memories keep popping up."

898
01:12:55,285 --> 01:12:57,054
"I also remember this."

899
01:12:57,054 --> 01:13:00,182
"He was hit by a truck
on the way to school,"

900
01:13:00,257 --> 01:13:02,225
"An ambulance took him."

901
01:13:02,826 --> 01:13:05,226
"It was hilarious at school."

902
01:13:05,596 --> 01:13:09,760
Fujii Itsuki had
an accident this morning.

903
01:13:10,834 --> 01:13:12,859
We don't know the details.

904
01:13:12,970 --> 01:13:15,461
Miss Hamaguchi
went to the hospital.

905
01:13:15,572 --> 01:13:17,403
So, I'll be
in charge of today's homeroom,

906
01:13:21,512 --> 01:13:25,414
Fujii, why are you here?

907
01:13:29,386 --> 01:13:30,444
Study hour.

908
01:13:33,524 --> 01:13:35,287
What was that about?

909
01:13:39,329 --> 01:13:42,196
"His left leg had
a compound fracture."

910
01:13:42,933 --> 01:13:46,460
"It was a month before
the school track meet."

911
01:13:47,237 --> 01:13:49,728
"He was to run
in the 100 meter race."

912
01:14:04,354 --> 01:14:09,382
Course 1, Ikeda.

913
01:14:10,661 --> 01:14:15,598
Course 2, Taguchi.

914
01:14:17,434 --> 01:14:18,765
Come on.

915
01:14:22,573 --> 01:14:24,370
Look at this camera.

916
01:14:24,441 --> 01:14:25,635
Can you see?

917
01:14:40,791 --> 01:14:42,418
On your mark.

918
01:14:52,436 --> 01:14:53,334
Ready.

919
01:15:31,208 --> 01:15:32,197
Who are you?

920
01:15:32,309 --> 01:15:33,401
Where are you from?

921
01:15:33,610 --> 01:15:34,508
Which school?

922
01:15:42,519 --> 01:15:43,952
Who the hell is he?

923
01:15:44,021 --> 01:15:45,511
I demand a re-start.

924
01:15:45,656 --> 01:15:47,521
He's ruining the race.

925
01:15:50,527 --> 01:15:52,085
What's he up to anyway?

926
01:15:52,162 --> 01:15:53,754
How do you focus it?

927
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:55,764
Didn't you see that?

928
01:15:55,832 --> 01:15:57,231
What happened?

929
01:16:01,638 --> 01:16:03,003
"That became"

930
01:16:03,073 --> 01:16:06,509
"his last sprint
in his junior high years."

931
01:16:07,911 --> 01:16:09,572
You're home today?

932
01:16:09,646 --> 01:16:12,206
Hey, don't barge in like this.

933
01:16:14,017 --> 01:16:15,917
It's an exception today.

934
01:16:16,086 --> 01:16:17,986
No exceptions allowed.

935
01:16:19,222 --> 01:16:20,211
This is for you.

936
01:16:21,324 --> 01:16:22,848
Sign it, please.

937
01:16:31,168 --> 01:16:33,796
"Dear Fujii Itsuki"

938
01:16:34,404 --> 01:16:35,871
"Please take pictures"

939
01:16:35,972 --> 01:16:37,803
"of the ground he ran on."

940
01:18:22,112 --> 01:18:23,807
Can I help you?

941
01:18:25,215 --> 01:18:26,580
What are you looking for?

942
01:18:33,223 --> 01:18:34,656
Miss Hamaguchi...

943
01:18:36,126 --> 01:18:39,186
I was in your 3rd Year Class 2.

944
01:18:40,096 --> 01:18:41,120
Fujii?

945
01:18:41,231 --> 01:18:42,265
Yes.

946
01:18:42,265 --> 01:18:43,289
Do you remember me?

947
01:18:44,301 --> 01:18:46,769
Fujii Itsuki. 3rd Year Class 2.

948
01:18:46,870 --> 01:18:48,428
Your attendance number was...

949
01:18:49,139 --> 01:18:55,635
Aizawa, Okazaki, Kato, Koyama,
Sato, Sato, Shoji, Hattori...

950
01:18:55,712 --> 01:18:59,648
Ito, Endo, Kanzaki,
Suzuki, Tsuchiya, Nakajima...

951
01:19:01,751 --> 01:19:02,809
Number 24.

952
01:19:03,053 --> 01:19:05,078
Wow. How could you?

953
01:19:05,255 --> 01:19:09,385
So you work
at the Municipal Library?

954
01:19:09,659 --> 01:19:12,253
Funny I ended up working there.

955
01:19:12,662 --> 01:19:14,892
Your library duty wasn't wasted.

956
01:19:14,965 --> 01:19:17,263
I really enjoyed that.

957
01:19:18,768 --> 01:19:21,236
We're putting the books in order.

958
01:19:23,173 --> 01:19:26,540
Wow. I sure miss all this.

959
01:19:26,610 --> 01:19:28,009
Come here, everyone.

960
01:19:37,621 --> 01:19:40,089
This is our graduate, Miss Fujii.

961
01:19:41,057 --> 01:19:42,183
Hello.

962
01:19:43,693 --> 01:19:45,217
Hear that? She's Fujii.

963
01:19:48,798 --> 01:19:50,060
Miss Fujii Itsuki.

964
01:19:51,301 --> 01:19:52,700
You know her?

965
01:19:55,538 --> 01:19:56,835
Far out!

966
01:20:02,379 --> 01:20:03,778
There's a game we play.

967
01:20:03,847 --> 01:20:07,010
We call it
Looking for Fujii Itsuki.

968
01:20:08,952 --> 01:20:10,749
Who found it first?

969
01:20:10,921 --> 01:20:12,912
Kubota did.

970
01:20:13,223 --> 01:20:15,384
Then we found many more books.

971
01:20:15,859 --> 01:20:17,759
We compete to see

972
01:20:17,827 --> 01:20:19,954
who can find the most books.

973
01:20:21,264 --> 01:20:23,630
We even made a score chart.

974
01:20:24,067 --> 01:20:25,591
Where did we put that?

975
01:20:25,802 --> 01:20:28,600
The craze cooled off now.

976
01:20:28,905 --> 01:20:30,395
How many did we find?

977
01:20:30,507 --> 01:20:31,804
Let me see..,

978
01:20:32,409 --> 01:20:35,207
So far..,we've found 87.

979
01:20:35,578 --> 01:20:36,875
Did you find so many?

980
01:20:37,747 --> 01:20:41,547
But we never thought we'd be
able to meet her in person.

981
01:20:41,751 --> 01:20:45,050
I didn't write
these library cards.

982
01:20:45,188 --> 01:20:47,816
A friend of mine
did it for kicks.

983
01:20:49,292 --> 01:20:51,260
Was that a boy?

984
01:20:52,829 --> 01:20:53,625
Yes.

985
01:20:53,897 --> 01:20:58,266
That boy...He must have
liked you a lot.

986
01:20:59,336 --> 01:21:02,965
Because he wrote
your name so many times.

987
01:21:06,042 --> 01:21:08,340
Were you going out with him?

988
01:21:10,347 --> 01:21:12,838
You've got it all wrong.

989
01:21:12,916 --> 01:21:15,680
These are not my names.

990
01:21:15,952 --> 01:21:17,180
They're not.

991
01:21:18,989 --> 01:21:22,117
It's so romantic. I envy you.

992
01:21:26,463 --> 01:21:28,431
They sure put me in a spot.

993
01:21:28,498 --> 01:21:30,125
Aren't they something?

994
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,293
I put up with them everyday.

995
01:21:32,402 --> 01:21:33,869
That's true.

996
01:21:34,304 --> 01:21:35,498
Who was it?

997
01:21:36,306 --> 01:21:38,206
The boy who liked you?

998
01:21:38,975 --> 01:21:40,943
Who wrote all the cards?

999
01:21:41,544 --> 01:21:43,444
Please, Miss Hamaguchi.

1000
01:21:43,513 --> 01:21:45,242
Oh, come on.

1001
01:21:45,582 --> 01:21:48,142
That wasn't my name.

1002
01:21:49,152 --> 01:21:52,053
Remember?
There was another Fujii Itsuki.

1003
01:21:52,489 --> 01:21:54,524
What? You mean that boy?

1004
01:21:54,524 --> 01:21:56,515
It was his doing.

1005
01:21:58,795 --> 01:22:00,422
Remember his attendance number?

1006
01:22:00,497 --> 01:22:01,589
Nine.

1007
01:22:02,032 --> 01:22:03,659
Terrific,

1008
01:22:03,733 --> 01:22:05,496
It was no more than a second.

1009
01:22:06,836 --> 01:22:09,100
He became a very special boy.

1010
01:22:09,839 --> 01:22:11,898
Didn't he die 2 years ago?

1011
01:22:12,342 --> 01:22:14,105
During mountain climbing.

1012
01:22:52,449 --> 01:22:53,438
It's hot.

1013
01:23:05,628 --> 01:23:08,153
One more station to go.

1014
01:24:40,056 --> 01:24:41,216
What is it?

1015
01:24:41,658 --> 01:24:42,784
A dragon-fly.

1016
01:24:59,609 --> 01:25:01,736
Dad died, didn't he?

1017
01:25:19,862 --> 01:25:22,592
A friend of mine lives near here.

1018
01:25:23,733 --> 01:25:25,394
His name is Kaji

1019
01:25:25,501 --> 01:25:28,095
so everybody calls him Kaji Bear.

1020
01:25:28,738 --> 01:25:31,707
He's fierce as a bear.

1021
01:25:31,874 --> 01:25:33,603
That's why he calls him that.

1022
01:25:35,478 --> 01:25:38,572
We'll stay
at his place tonight and

1023
01:25:38,648 --> 01:25:40,946
go to mountain in the morning.

1024
01:25:42,785 --> 01:25:44,616
Look, It's over there.

1025
01:25:44,887 --> 01:25:46,445
You can see the mountain top.

1026
01:25:50,927 --> 01:25:51,916
What's the matter?

1027
01:25:52,562 --> 01:25:53,654
I can't.

1028
01:25:55,698 --> 01:25:57,131
I just can't.

1029
01:25:58,868 --> 01:25:59,926
Hiroko.

1030
01:26:01,471 --> 01:26:03,803
What are we doing?

1031
01:26:04,307 --> 01:26:06,434
This can't be right.

1032
01:26:09,245 --> 01:26:10,769
It can't be right.

1033
01:26:11,347 --> 01:26:12,780
Hiroko.

1034
01:26:14,584 --> 01:26:16,347
He'll be angry.

1035
01:26:16,552 --> 01:26:18,019
He won't be,

1036
01:26:18,588 --> 01:26:19,577
Let's go home.

1037
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:24,957
We came all the way

1038
01:26:25,028 --> 01:26:26,689
to put aside the past.

1039
01:26:26,929 --> 01:26:27,896
Please.

1040
01:26:27,964 --> 01:26:29,829
You must put it aside, Hiroko.

1041
01:26:32,702 --> 01:26:34,260
Please..,

1042
01:26:34,904 --> 01:26:36,428
Let me go home.

1043
01:26:48,851 --> 01:26:50,842
DEAR WATANABE HIROKO

1044
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:54,014
MY DAD NEGLECTED
A COLD, AND DIED.

1045
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:58,852
What's wrong?

1046
01:27:01,097 --> 01:27:03,622
Did you check your temperature?

1047
01:27:03,733 --> 01:27:05,223
It's broken.

1048
01:27:05,968 --> 01:27:06,935
Let me see.

1049
01:27:10,506 --> 01:27:11,598
Itsuki.

1050
01:27:12,775 --> 01:27:14,242
Itsuki.

1051
01:27:19,382 --> 01:27:21,179
41.8 degrees?

1052
01:27:24,721 --> 01:27:25,983
Grandpa.

1053
01:27:26,422 --> 01:27:27,650
Grandpa.

1054
01:27:32,395 --> 01:27:33,760
Grandpa.

1055
01:27:36,165 --> 01:27:37,962
Call the ambulance.

1056
01:27:39,802 --> 01:27:41,599
And please bring a blanket.

1057
01:27:49,579 --> 01:27:50,807
Grandpa, the blanket.

1058
01:27:52,682 --> 01:27:53,740
Itsuki.

1059
01:27:54,450 --> 01:27:55,747
Grandpa, the blanket.

1060
01:27:55,918 --> 01:27:57,545
Did you call 119?

1061
01:27:57,687 --> 01:27:58,711
The blanket?

1062
01:27:59,021 --> 01:28:00,454
The ambulance first.

1063
01:28:01,023 --> 01:28:02,081
And Itsuki?

1064
01:28:02,392 --> 01:28:03,859
I'll carry her,

1065
01:28:04,093 --> 01:28:05,082
But...

1066
01:28:05,161 --> 01:28:06,992
Just call 119.

1067
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,561
I'm cold...I'm cold.

1068
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:19,638
One hour? What nonsense
are you talking about?

1069
01:28:19,776 --> 01:28:21,903
Why would it take that long?

1070
01:28:22,845 --> 01:28:25,609
What? The snow?

1071
01:28:34,424 --> 01:28:35,652
The ambulance?

1072
01:28:35,892 --> 01:28:37,325
Can't wait.

1073
01:28:37,994 --> 01:28:39,256
Grandpa.

1074
01:28:39,395 --> 01:28:40,953
Bring the blanket.

1075
01:28:41,464 --> 01:28:42,590
What're you doing?

1076
01:28:42,665 --> 01:28:44,599
If we catch a cab

1077
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:46,930
it's 15 minutes to the hospital.

1078
01:28:54,777 --> 01:28:56,267
The taxi's not good.

1079
01:28:57,046 --> 01:28:58,274
Can't catch any.

1080
01:28:58,347 --> 01:29:00,008
In that case, I'll walk.

1081
01:29:01,117 --> 01:29:02,744
Are you out for your mind?

1082
01:29:02,819 --> 01:29:04,150
You can't do that.

1083
01:29:04,821 --> 01:29:05,810
Call the ambulance.

1084
01:29:05,888 --> 01:29:08,118
They say it takes one hour.

1085
01:29:08,191 --> 01:29:09,089
What?

1086
01:29:10,426 --> 01:29:10,983
Why?

1087
01:29:11,060 --> 01:29:12,789
Look outside.

1088
01:29:28,411 --> 01:29:29,400
Where's the blanket?

1089
01:29:29,779 --> 01:29:31,007
Hello...hello...

1090
01:29:31,514 --> 01:29:34,415
This is Fujii. We called before.

1091
01:29:34,650 --> 01:29:35,617
Yes...

1092
01:29:36,385 --> 01:29:40,446
Yes, we are. We're using ice
to lower the temperature.

1093
01:29:41,090 --> 01:29:43,422
Who are you talking to?

1094
01:29:43,493 --> 01:29:46,121
Grandpa, lay Itsuki on the sofa.

1095
01:29:46,195 --> 01:29:48,254
We must keep her warm.

1096
01:29:48,331 --> 01:29:50,231
And would you...

1097
01:29:50,533 --> 01:29:51,295
Hey.

1098
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:54,369
Grandpa, I asked you
to lay Itsuki on the sofa.

1099
01:29:54,470 --> 01:29:55,801
Must warm her,

1100
01:29:55,872 --> 01:29:57,396
They told me that.

1101
01:29:57,507 --> 01:29:58,872
Then do as they say.

1102
01:29:58,941 --> 01:30:01,933
That won't make
the ambulance come.

1103
01:30:03,079 --> 01:30:04,546
They say it's coming.

1104
01:30:04,614 --> 01:30:05,945
In about an hour.

1105
01:30:06,983 --> 01:30:10,475
Look. It's getting worse.

1106
01:30:11,187 --> 01:30:13,382
It'll be even worse.

1107
01:30:15,157 --> 01:30:16,784
One hour, right?

1108
01:30:19,295 --> 01:30:20,489
One hour.

1109
01:30:24,934 --> 01:30:26,231
Please wait a second.

1110
01:30:27,503 --> 01:30:29,562
Grandpa. Put her down.

1111
01:30:29,672 --> 01:30:30,832
Bring the blanket.

1112
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:32,237
Not the taxi,

1113
01:30:32,308 --> 01:30:33,775
Hurry up and bring it.

1114
01:30:33,843 --> 01:30:35,640
Want to kill her, too?

1115
01:30:43,519 --> 01:30:45,350
Get hold of yourself.

1116
01:30:47,723 --> 01:30:49,486
Remember the last time?

1117
01:30:51,527 --> 01:30:53,893
You ignored 119

1118
01:30:53,963 --> 01:30:55,863
and went to find a taxi.

1119
01:30:55,932 --> 01:30:58,127
You couldn't get a taxi.

1120
01:31:01,203 --> 01:31:02,830
Carried him on your back

1121
01:31:02,939 --> 01:31:05,237
and walked to the hospital.

1122
01:31:05,308 --> 01:31:06,468
Don't you remember?

1123
01:31:08,144 --> 01:31:10,169
The treatment was delayed

1124
01:31:11,247 --> 01:31:13,272
and that's how he died,

1125
01:31:14,817 --> 01:31:17,377
Why do you want to repeat that?

1126
01:31:18,154 --> 01:31:19,416
At a time like this

1127
01:31:19,922 --> 01:31:22,618
we must listen
to the specialists,

1128
01:31:23,092 --> 01:31:25,492
You understand, don't you?

1129
01:31:32,101 --> 01:31:35,730
How long did it take
to the hospital that time?

1130
01:31:38,307 --> 01:31:39,535
How many minutes?

1131
01:31:43,412 --> 01:31:44,674
One hour.

1132
01:31:45,181 --> 01:31:46,546
At least one hour.

1133
01:31:46,882 --> 01:31:47,906
Not that long.

1134
01:31:48,584 --> 01:31:49,573
It took that long.

1135
01:31:51,053 --> 01:31:52,418
It was 40 minutes.

1136
01:31:55,358 --> 01:31:57,417
It took 40 minutes that time.

1137
01:31:58,494 --> 01:31:59,688
It was no longer than that.

1138
01:32:00,162 --> 01:32:01,686
No, it was 40 minutes.

1139
01:32:03,065 --> 01:32:07,126
To be precise,
to the hospital entrance

1140
01:32:07,236 --> 01:32:09,170
it was exactly 38 minutes.

1141
01:32:12,008 --> 01:32:14,272
But it was too late.

1142
01:32:15,478 --> 01:32:18,709
Either way
he wouldn't have made it.

1143
01:32:22,752 --> 01:32:24,811
If we leave here now

1144
01:32:25,187 --> 01:32:29,283
We'll reach the hospital
before the ambulance comes.

1145
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,418
Your decision.

1146
01:32:33,496 --> 01:32:35,828
Itsuki is your daughter.

1147
01:32:37,533 --> 01:32:39,057
You must decide.

1148
01:32:46,409 --> 01:32:50,573
But it's impossible
to walk in this snow.

1149
01:32:51,013 --> 01:32:55,473
I will not walk, I will run.

1150
01:33:04,727 --> 01:33:08,128
We'll stay one night here.

1151
01:33:08,497 --> 01:33:09,395
Okay?

1152
01:33:17,173 --> 01:33:18,470
Hi, there, Akiba.

1153
01:33:19,341 --> 01:33:21,605
What happened to your face?

1154
01:33:22,445 --> 01:33:25,312
I told you he looks like a bear.

1155
01:33:33,255 --> 01:33:35,485
His death is a loss to us all.

1156
01:33:36,225 --> 01:33:38,853
I wonder why
good guys always die young.

1157
01:33:39,662 --> 01:33:42,563
Kaji Bear was in the party, too

1158
01:33:42,631 --> 01:33:44,064
when that accident took place.

1159
01:33:44,133 --> 01:33:47,762
I had more hair
at the time, though.

1160
01:33:47,870 --> 01:33:50,270
You definitely had more hair.

1161
01:33:52,274 --> 01:33:54,105
He's a great guy.

1162
01:33:54,443 --> 01:33:55,808
Since the accident

1163
01:33:55,878 --> 01:33:57,869
he looks after the climbers here.

1164
01:33:59,615 --> 01:34:01,674
Because of the accident

1165
01:34:01,751 --> 01:34:04,811
I've become an expert
on that mountain,

1166
01:34:04,887 --> 01:34:10,348
But since I tell the climbers
where to be careful or

1167
01:34:10,426 --> 01:34:12,519
not to ignore the weather

1168
01:34:12,595 --> 01:34:14,426
they find me annoying.

1169
01:34:14,997 --> 01:34:16,589
You're a great guy.

1170
01:34:17,133 --> 01:34:19,624
I ran away from the mountain.

1171
01:34:19,702 --> 01:34:22,000
Don't you want to climb again?

1172
01:34:25,441 --> 01:34:26,931
No, it's impossible.

1173
01:34:27,643 --> 01:34:28,610
How come?

1174
01:34:29,745 --> 01:34:30,939
I'm just...

1175
01:34:33,749 --> 01:34:34,875
...scared.

1176
01:34:48,164 --> 01:34:49,131
Hey.

1177
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:54,829
My love runs

1178
01:34:56,138 --> 01:35:03,476
on the south wind

1179
01:35:04,613 --> 01:35:06,171
What is this song?

1180
01:35:06,248 --> 01:35:08,944
Is it your club song
or something?

1181
01:35:10,119 --> 01:35:12,417
He sang this before he died.

1182
01:35:15,157 --> 01:35:17,022
He fell into a ravine,

1183
01:35:17,226 --> 01:35:19,251
We couldn't see him

1184
01:35:20,396 --> 01:35:22,921
but we heard him singing.

1185
01:35:23,766 --> 01:35:27,702
Of all the songs in the world,
why did it have to be this?

1186
01:35:29,538 --> 01:35:32,405
He didn't even
like Seiko Matsuda.

1187
01:35:33,209 --> 01:35:34,904
He was a strange one.

1188
01:35:34,977 --> 01:35:36,103
He sure was,

1189
01:35:41,517 --> 01:35:49,925
You know, he never
asked me to marry him,

1190
01:35:54,964 --> 01:35:57,797
He called me to Mt.Maya.

1191
01:35:57,933 --> 01:36:01,733
He had the engagement ring
in his hand.

1192
01:36:02,037 --> 01:36:04,767
But he didn't say anything.

1193
01:36:06,108 --> 01:36:09,771
We stayed there without a word

1194
01:36:09,845 --> 01:36:12,279
for about two hours.

1195
01:36:14,850 --> 01:36:18,445
I began to feel sorry for him.

1196
01:36:19,021 --> 01:36:20,716
So I ended up

1197
01:36:20,890 --> 01:36:26,294
asking him to marry me.

1198
01:36:28,297 --> 01:36:30,231
Then he said one word.

1199
01:36:30,499 --> 01:36:31,864
Okay.

1200
01:36:36,705 --> 01:36:38,798
That's the way he was.

1201
01:36:40,309 --> 01:36:44,370
He was hopeless
in front of girls.

1202
01:36:46,649 --> 01:36:48,640
They're all good memories.

1203
01:36:49,251 --> 01:36:50,445
That's true.

1204
01:36:51,787 --> 01:36:54,415
He gave me lots of good memories.

1205
01:36:56,425 --> 01:36:57,585
You're right.

1206
01:37:01,063 --> 01:37:03,998
But I want more from him.

1207
01:37:08,737 --> 01:37:11,001
I pester him after his death

1208
01:37:11,607 --> 01:37:14,440
and beg for more,

1209
01:37:17,613 --> 01:37:19,774
I'm such a selfish girl.

1210
01:37:26,422 --> 01:37:28,219
But grandpa.

1211
01:37:28,691 --> 01:37:31,387
It's 10 years since then.

1212
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:33,485
So? What's the problem?

1213
01:37:33,595 --> 01:37:35,563
You're 75 this year.

1214
01:37:35,631 --> 01:37:37,462
No, 76.

1215
01:37:37,733 --> 01:37:39,064
You can't do it.

1216
01:37:39,168 --> 01:37:41,227
Age has nothing to do with it.

1217
01:37:41,337 --> 01:37:42,736
Yes, it does,

1218
01:37:45,307 --> 01:37:46,740
Grandpa.

1219
01:37:48,177 --> 01:37:49,940
It's impossible.

1220
01:37:58,387 --> 01:37:59,411
Wait.

1221
01:38:00,589 --> 01:38:01,988
Please wait.

1222
01:38:09,832 --> 01:38:11,629
Don't worry.

1223
01:38:12,801 --> 01:38:15,133
Even if it costs me my life

1224
01:38:15,304 --> 01:38:19,263
I'll get there within 40 minutes.

1225
01:38:29,251 --> 01:38:30,684
This patient...

1226
01:38:30,753 --> 01:38:32,050
The oxygen.

1227
01:38:54,109 --> 01:38:55,406
Akiko.

1228
01:38:56,712 --> 01:38:59,840
We're not
moving out of the house.

1229
01:39:01,850 --> 01:39:03,283
I'm absolutely sure.

1230
01:39:05,187 --> 01:39:07,348
Whether it's our grandpa

1231
01:39:08,123 --> 01:39:11,957
or the house, I'll stay and
witness which falls first.

1232
01:39:13,228 --> 01:39:15,423
As a real estate agent I guarantee

1233
01:39:15,497 --> 01:39:17,328
the house'll fall first.

1234
01:39:17,399 --> 01:39:18,457
Don't worry, Akiko.

1235
01:39:18,567 --> 01:39:20,000
They'll both be okay.

1236
01:39:22,137 --> 01:39:23,104
Hiroko.

1237
01:39:30,446 --> 01:39:31,743
Hiroko.

1238
01:39:35,651 --> 01:39:36,982
What is it?

1239
01:39:37,052 --> 01:39:38,349
Come and take a look.

1240
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:40,654
It's such a beautiful dawn.

1241
01:40:00,242 --> 01:40:01,209
What?

1242
01:40:02,911 --> 01:40:04,037
See it?

1243
01:40:04,813 --> 01:40:05,802
See what?

1244
01:40:08,450 --> 01:40:10,213
That's the mountain.

1245
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:21,125
Take a good look,

1246
01:40:21,563 --> 01:40:23,326
Fujii is there.

1247
01:40:44,620 --> 01:40:46,281
Fujii.

1248
01:40:46,622 --> 01:40:50,080
Are you still singing
that Seiko Matsuda song?

1249
01:40:54,730 --> 01:40:57,756
Aren't you cold up there?

1250
01:41:01,203 --> 01:41:04,536
I'm taking Hiroko from you.

1251
01:41:05,641 --> 01:41:07,404
Go ahead.

1252
01:41:08,010 --> 01:41:09,534
Go ahead.

1253
01:41:13,582 --> 01:41:16,551
He says go ahead.

1254
01:41:16,818 --> 01:41:18,809
That's cheating, Akiba.

1255
01:41:21,490 --> 01:41:23,481
Hiroko, say something to him.

1256
01:41:25,294 --> 01:41:27,353
Must have a lot of complaints.

1257
01:41:27,429 --> 01:41:28,396
Go on.

1258
01:42:24,419 --> 01:42:27,855
How are you?

1259
01:42:31,126 --> 01:42:35,062
I'm very well.

1260
01:42:39,201 --> 01:42:46,539
"Dear Fujii Itsuki"

1261
01:42:49,077 --> 01:42:52,046
"How are you?"

1262
01:42:52,414 --> 01:42:55,440
How are you?

1263
01:42:56,385 --> 01:43:00,754
"I'm very well."

1264
01:43:02,624 --> 01:43:06,219
I'm very well.

1265
01:43:07,596 --> 01:43:09,996
"How are you?"

1266
01:43:10,065 --> 01:43:11,862
How are you?

1267
01:43:12,601 --> 01:43:13,727
"I'm..."

1268
01:43:13,935 --> 01:43:15,368
I'm very well.

1269
01:43:15,637 --> 01:43:17,969
"How are you?"

1270
01:43:21,643 --> 01:43:23,668
How are you?

1271
01:43:25,013 --> 01:43:28,312
I'm very well.

1272
01:43:31,019 --> 01:43:33,613
How are you?

1273
01:43:45,801 --> 01:43:47,826
What's this racket?

1274
01:43:48,337 --> 01:43:50,532
At this early hour.

1275
01:43:52,407 --> 01:43:54,136
Don't interrupt her.

1276
01:43:56,645 --> 01:43:58,670
This is the best part.

1277
01:44:26,508 --> 01:44:28,703
"Dear Watanabe Hiroko"

1278
01:44:29,177 --> 01:44:30,644
"Of all things"

1279
01:44:30,712 --> 01:44:33,374
"my dad died
of a neglected cold,"

1280
01:44:44,659 --> 01:44:47,685
"It was the New Year Day
when I was in the 3rd year."

1281
01:44:48,430 --> 01:44:49,829
"Because of the funeral"

1282
01:44:49,898 --> 01:44:53,732
"right after New Year,
it was hectic."

1283
01:44:55,303 --> 01:44:56,270
Ouch.

1284
01:44:56,338 --> 01:44:57,635
Akane, it hurts.

1285
01:45:00,842 --> 01:45:03,003
"Mom collapsed from fatigue."

1286
01:45:04,079 --> 01:45:06,547
"The new term had started"

1287
01:45:06,615 --> 01:45:10,210
"but I couldn't go to school."

1288
01:45:11,887 --> 01:45:13,252
"One day..."

1289
01:45:21,129 --> 01:45:21,993
Yes?

1290
01:45:27,035 --> 01:45:27,831
What?

1291
01:45:28,170 --> 01:45:29,364
What's up?

1292
01:45:30,238 --> 01:45:32,001
Why are you here?

1293
01:45:32,407 --> 01:45:33,772
- -What happened to school?
- -What happened to school?

1294
01:45:37,546 --> 01:45:38,570
What is it?

1295
01:45:38,814 --> 01:45:41,078
Just this.

1296
01:45:43,251 --> 01:45:44,741
Borrowed it before the break.

1297
01:45:44,820 --> 01:45:46,378
Forgot to return it.

1298
01:45:46,588 --> 01:45:47,714
Return it.

1299
01:45:48,156 --> 01:45:50,386
Why don't you
return yourself?

1300
01:45:50,826 --> 01:45:51,884
I'm asking you

1301
01:45:51,960 --> 01:45:53,154
because I can't.

1302
01:45:53,428 --> 01:45:54,292
Why not?

1303
01:45:55,363 --> 01:45:56,853
Please return it.

1304
01:46:00,902 --> 01:46:01,869
IN MOURNING

1305
01:46:03,472 --> 01:46:05,372
Did anyone die?

1306
01:46:06,475 --> 01:46:07,464
My dad did.

1307
01:46:12,914 --> 01:46:16,042
Please accept
my sympathy for your loss.

1308
01:46:20,722 --> 01:46:21,780
What's wrong?

1309
01:46:22,023 --> 01:46:23,217
Nothing,

1310
01:46:44,513 --> 01:46:46,981
"That was
the last time I saw him."

1311
01:46:48,183 --> 01:46:52,244
"When I went to school
a week later..."

1312
01:47:03,498 --> 01:47:06,331
It's lnaba's doing again.

1313
01:47:07,202 --> 01:47:10,035
No, I didn't do it. He did it.

1314
01:47:11,006 --> 01:47:14,169
Did you know Fujii
transferred to another school?

1315
01:47:15,410 --> 01:47:18,675
Seems it was so sudden
he couldn't say goodbye.

1316
01:47:22,284 --> 01:47:23,182
What is it?

1317
01:47:37,933 --> 01:47:39,025
Itsuki.

1318
01:48:12,934 --> 01:48:14,697
FUJII ITSUKI

1319
01:48:19,441 --> 01:48:20,533
REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS LOST

1320
01:48:51,373 --> 01:48:54,274
"This is the last memory
I have of him."

1321
01:48:54,943 --> 01:48:57,707
"And this is probably
the last story"

1322
01:48:57,779 --> 01:48:59,804
"I can write to you about."

1323
01:49:02,117 --> 01:49:03,607
Itsuki.

1324
01:49:03,885 --> 01:49:05,250
Wait a second.

1325
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:06,719
Almost done.

1326
01:49:10,659 --> 01:49:13,059
"Dear Fujii Itsuki"

1327
01:49:13,995 --> 01:49:17,692
"The memories written
in these letters belong to you."

1328
01:49:17,766 --> 01:49:20,701
"So you should hang on to them."

1329
01:49:22,003 --> 01:49:24,938
"Thank you for all your kindness."

1330
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:28,038
"I truly appreciate it,"

1331
01:49:29,544 --> 01:49:30,636
"P.S..."

1332
01:49:31,813 --> 01:49:34,748
"P.S...The name
on the library cards"

1333
01:49:34,816 --> 01:49:37,910
"was it really his name?"

1334
01:49:38,086 --> 01:49:40,418
What does she mean?

1335
01:49:41,289 --> 01:49:42,984
"I have a feeling"

1336
01:49:43,058 --> 01:49:46,755
"the name he wrote
was intended to be your name."

1337
01:49:47,929 --> 01:49:51,797
What? What does she
mean by this?

1338
01:49:52,734 --> 01:49:53,598
What is it?

1339
01:49:53,968 --> 01:49:55,196
Nothing,

1340
01:49:58,306 --> 01:50:01,673
I had a classmate in
junior high with the same name.

1341
01:50:01,743 --> 01:50:03,267
And it was a boy.

1342
01:50:03,945 --> 01:50:04,877
And?

1343
01:50:05,346 --> 01:50:06,438
That's all.

1344
01:50:07,682 --> 01:50:09,445
Was he your first love?

1345
01:50:09,684 --> 01:50:11,276
Wasn't anything like that.

1346
01:50:11,352 --> 01:50:13,582
There was such a boy. That's all.

1347
01:50:16,591 --> 01:50:18,718
When I planted that tree

1348
01:50:19,694 --> 01:50:21,924
I gave it a name.

1349
01:50:22,697 --> 01:50:25,598
Can you guess what name it is?

1350
01:50:26,468 --> 01:50:27,298
No.

1351
01:50:27,769 --> 01:50:29,236
I named it Itsuki.

1352
01:50:29,704 --> 01:50:31,934
The same as your name.

1353
01:50:33,842 --> 01:50:34,809
You're kidding.

1354
01:50:37,545 --> 01:50:39,536
When you were born

1355
01:50:39,614 --> 01:50:41,445
I planted that tree.

1356
01:50:42,550 --> 01:50:46,646
That's why I gave
both of you the same name.

1357
01:50:46,821 --> 01:50:47,981
Which one?

1358
01:50:48,056 --> 01:50:49,648
You didn't know, huh?

1359
01:50:50,058 --> 01:50:51,650
Which tree is it?

1360
01:50:53,995 --> 01:50:55,053
That one?

1361
01:50:57,298 --> 01:50:58,287
That?

1362
01:50:59,067 --> 01:51:00,557
What are you two up to?

1363
01:51:02,103 --> 01:51:03,570
Is it really true?

1364
01:51:03,671 --> 01:51:05,536
Didn't you make it up?

1365
01:51:15,116 --> 01:51:16,378
This is it.

1366
01:51:20,555 --> 01:51:24,013
"Dear Watanabe Hiroko,
my strange pen-pal"

1367
01:51:24,125 --> 01:51:25,490
"How are you doing?"

1368
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:27,951
"I'm doing well as usual."

1369
01:51:28,029 --> 01:51:30,224
"As for how usual, I am..."

1370
01:51:30,331 --> 01:51:32,390
"Never mind that."

1371
01:51:33,201 --> 01:51:36,602
"Something great happened today."

1372
01:51:36,871 --> 01:51:39,135
"I want to tell you about it."

1373
01:51:39,207 --> 01:51:41,175
"That's why I'm writing this."

1374
01:51:41,276 --> 01:51:43,904
Or rather, banging my keyboard.

1375
01:51:44,946 --> 01:51:49,406
"It was brought on
by unexpected visitors."

1376
01:51:50,618 --> 01:51:52,142
Hurry up. Hurry.

1377
01:52:01,529 --> 01:52:03,765
Oh, hi.

1378
01:52:03,765 --> 01:52:05,130
Hello.

1379
01:52:06,401 --> 01:52:07,629
What's going on?

1380
01:52:07,869 --> 01:52:10,963
We found something very nice.

1381
01:52:13,608 --> 01:52:14,370
It's this.

1382
01:52:23,484 --> 01:52:24,416
The back cover.

1383
01:52:24,485 --> 01:52:25,509
It's inside.

1384
01:52:25,587 --> 01:52:26,281
Other side.

1385
01:52:26,354 --> 01:52:27,946
The card in the back.

1386
01:52:41,936 --> 01:52:42,698
The back.

1387
01:52:42,804 --> 01:52:43,429
The back.

1388
01:53:17,171 --> 01:53:19,196
"Dear Watanabe Hiroko"

1389
01:53:21,976 --> 01:53:24,069
"I'm too embarrassed"

1390
01:53:24,579 --> 01:53:26,843
"to mail this letter to you."
