1
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,440
the party

2
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,200
It's Christian. I'm here.

3
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,840
I arrived this morning.

4
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,360
sorry ?

5
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:03,720
If I washed ?
No, did shave though, at the airport.

6
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,000
I shaved at the airport.

7
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,720
Good. I'm watching the landscape.

8
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,920
From my father. It's beautifull here.

9
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,200
I wish I could live here again.
But that's impossible.

10
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,080
I'll manage.

11
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,600
Yes, it will be a shock.

12
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,760
What ? I'm loosing you.

13
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,960
Oké. Bye.

14
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,120
Damn. That's my brother.

15
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,360
Why are you so quite ?

16
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,080
I didn't recognise him.

17
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,040
Have to do everything myself.

18
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,480
Christian, what are you doing here?

19
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,640
You see that, Kasper ?
He came all the way from Paris by foot.

20
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,200
No, I didn't. Only from the station.

21
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,680
Hi.
- Cool, man.

22
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:26,040
I'll get you.
Giddyup. I'll get you.

23
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,440
Damn.
- You're in a good mood.

24
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,040
It's been a long time. Unbelievable.

25
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,440
How are you ?

26
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll give you a lift.
Get out, kids.

27
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,440
I'm giving Christian a lift.
- There's room enough.

28
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,080
Come, Mette.

29
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,880
Get in the frontseat.
- I'll walk.

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,600
I have to talk to you.
- Do we have to walk all the way ?

31
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,320
What are you whining about ?
- It's an end.

32
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,360
He's my brother, damnit.
Stop whining.

33
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,040
Shut up.

34
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,520
Come on be quite.

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,280
You think dad is already there ?
- No, not yet.

36
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,360
Hi, what's your name ?
- Lars.

37
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,800
Lars. Listen up.

38
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:53,640
I always have problems with new staff. 
Just to let you know.

39
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,480
Who do you think we are ?

40
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,480
This is Christian, my brother.

41
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:07,600
He owns two restaurants in Paris.
I run a cafetaria at the harbour.

42
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,960
We've grown up here,
so we know how to treat customers.

43
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,600
A good receptionist
knows everybody's name.

44
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,120
We would like room 9 and room 19.

45
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,480
You're not on the list.

46
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,560
What's that ?
- Look again. Michael Klinkenfeldt.

47
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,640
Your father said you're not welcome.

48
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,760
Listen, Mads...
- My name is Lars.

49
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,160
Lars, last year I've gone a bit too far
, because I was drunk.

50
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,920
When I drink too much "schnaps",
I completely lose it.

51
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,720
I brought my wife and children.

52
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,240
Michelle is here too.

53
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:07,640
I didn't know about that.
Do you have a room for us ?

54
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,080
Where's my father ?
- He went hunting.

55
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,400
Then you'll take care of it yourself.
That's your job isn't it ?

56
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,640
Give him a room.
I'll talk to my father.

57
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,480
One of the small rooms.

58
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,200
They're never used.
3 and 1.

59
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,080
This one is okay.

60
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,480
Don't you want a key ?
- O, yeah.

61
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,720
I'm on his list.
Is little sis' already there ?

62
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,280
Hurry up.
My father turns 60 today.

63
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,960
Those people are family.
I'll have to welcome them.

64
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,800
Your name is Nadim ?
- That's wright.

65
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,960
Nadim, if you speed up,
I'll give you my phonenumber.

66
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,600
Hello, are you ready ?
They should be here any minute.

67
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,480
Have you been drinking ?
- Not today.

68
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,360
What a fantastic funeral, ey ?

69
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,160
I'm ready.
- What are you doing here ?

70
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,360
You where not at your sisters funeral.

71
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,960
What business is that of yours ?

72
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,520
I want to know why you were not there.

73
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,840
You where not at the funeral.

74
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,400
You don't call on birthdays,
You don't show any interest.

75
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,840
Now you got her started too.
I'm going home.

76
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,200
Have a nice trip.
- Wanne lend my bycicle ?

77
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:14,280
I'm not in the mood for this.
- O stop it. Let bygones be bygones.

78
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:19,040
Yes, stop it.
- You sound like Christian.

79
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,800
Don't.

80
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,160
Come.

81
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,760
Stop it.
- Listen to Christian.

82
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,200
Stop. Don't do it.

83
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,880
Honk again. Maybe they'll hear us.

84
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,720
That's his wife, with a son.

85
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,400
That's Mette.

86
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,720
And the three chickens.
Everything okay ?

87
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:04,040
Quite guys, we're here.
Behave yourself.

88
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,840
That's impossible. I'm your sister.

89
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,440
Luckily we only do this 
once every decade.

90
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,120
Welcome, grandfather.
- Thank you.

91
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,680
Thanks for the nice funeral.

92
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,080
Good to see you again.

93
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,840
Hello. Warm here.

94
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,560
I'm going to unpack my wife.

95
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,000
Hi, daddy.

96
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,800
I'm the master of ceremonies tonight,
okay ?

97
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,960
Do you know Lissy  ?

98
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,760
How do you do ?
- It's sad...

99
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,200
and then the beautifull weather...

100
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,440
You haven't changed one bit.
- Thank you.

101
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:26,040
Welcome. Helge is waiting for you inside.

102
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,720
Hello, uncle.

103
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,320
Christian, sweetheart.
Glad to see you here.

104
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,920
You're looking good.
- The guests are here.

105
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,160
Go to your father.
Don't forget to congratulate him.

106
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,760
Daddy, happy birthday.

107
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:57,960
Everyone's waiting.
- I have to tell you something important.

108
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,080
Sit down.

109
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,840
Please.

110
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,960
You want some cognac too ?
- No, thanks.

111
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:18,640
This is very important.
I've been thinking about it for days.

112
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,720
Listen.

113
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,720
Two hookers are in a train.

114
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,280
Don't make fun of your old father.
On his birthday.

115
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,120
How dare you ?
I should tell your mother.

116
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,360
We're waiting for you.
- He's making fun of me.

117
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,040
You shouldn't, Christian.
- Tell a joke.

118
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,440
I would like to have a word with my 
oldest son. How are you ?

119
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,720
Good.
I have a company in Lyon...

120
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,160
I read the papers too, you know.
Business is good.

121
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,840
How's that girlfriend of yours ?
Can't you come back ?

122
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
She already has children with another man.
- Then find another girlfriend.

123
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,680
I'm getting older.
I want to have you near me.

124
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,240
And then your mother...
- What's wrong with her ?

125
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,320
She's fed up with my jokes.
- I can understand that.

126
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:25,200
What do you mean ?
What's wrong with my jokes ?

127
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,480
Where's your respect ?

128
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,520
So how are you ? You have a girlfriend ?
O, I asked that already.

129
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,640
Come now.
- We're comming.

130
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,880
Come, son. One more thing...

131
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,480
Would you like to say something 
about your sister tonight?

132
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,720
I can't.

133
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,040
Alright. I've written something down.
- You did ? great.

134
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,040
Michael is here too.
- I'll have to talk to him then.

135
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,800
Our visitors are here.

136
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,480
Michelle, are you maried ?
- No.

137
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,320
Ask someone else.

138
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,240
O yeah, that was my other son.
I'll discuss this with him.

139
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,640
It's Helge's birthday.
hurrah, hurrah, hurrah.

140
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:25,480
he's getting lots of presents
and cookies and chocolat.

141
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:41,880
Hi. Where do you sleep ?
- Room 17. Why ?

142
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:47,280
I have to use your bath.
I mean, can I use your bath ?

143
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,720
And the sound of the sea.

144
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,120
I'll put them down here.

145
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,480
The main course is secret.

146
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,440
You've been hunting ?
- As usual.

147
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,640
You're listening ? Good.

148
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:31,080
We were moving to Copenhaven  
for the third time.

149
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,120
But then Bettina H. moved in with him.

150
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,640
Bettina H. ?

151
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,800
So I'm still here.
I walked throught the park yesterday.

152
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,960
I'm in the room where my sister died.

153
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,560
Better you then Christian. She was his twinsister.

154
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,280
That no one wants to talk it is one...

155
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,560
but it's stupid to act like nothing 
happeded.

156
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:04,760
Look at that, like a fairytale.
- You can say that.

157
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:10,160
Spooky. She wouldn't have like this herself.

158
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,760
Shall we take of the sheets ?

159
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,240
I'll stay with her then.
I don't mind.

160
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,640
Yes, ofcourse.
- Good.

161
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,920
Here's where it took place. 
In the bathroom.

162
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,000
Or shall I take another room?
- If you want to.

163
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,120
It's so...

164
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,200
It doesn't feel good.

165
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,320
Did you hear that ?

166
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,200
She's in the bathroom.

167
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,000
It can't be. She's dead.

168
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,280
I'll have a look.

169
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,440
Come on, let's go.
- No, let's have a look.

170
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,160
Mette, I can't find them.
- Did you look in the suitcases?

171
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,440
I can't find my shoes.
- They'll have to be in there.

172
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:14,480
I already looked there.
- Just relax.

173
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:20,800
I can't wear brown shoes.
- They should be there.

174
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,960
I looked everywhere.

175
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,600
Then I just forgot them.
- You must be kiddin'.

176
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:36,640
Go get them then. You have two hours.
By car.

177
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:42,120
Don't be crazy.
- My father's going to be furious.

178
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:47,280
Shall I get them ?
What will your parents think ?

179
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,760
I can't wear these shoes to diner, idiot.

180
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,360
Pack your own stuff then.

181
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,480
I packed for all of us.

182
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,960
Everything's got to be perfect.

183
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,640
If you have complaints,
you can pack your own stuff next time.

184
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,080
I'll tell you something.

185
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,800
You're the one who's packing.

186
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,320
And every time you forget my shoes.

187
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:31,040
You wanted to visit your stupid 
parents.

188
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,040
I worked for a confectioner once.

189
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,200
I'm making dessert tonight.

190
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,680
What does that mean, an arrow up?

191
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,680
If you lie down in the bath,
you'll maybe see something.

192
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,280
Do I have to lie down in the bath ?

193
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,720
Do I have to ?
- Try if you see something.

194
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,160
A sign or an arrow.

195
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,800
A fish or a bird.
Remember tracking?

196
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,560
Doesn't work.
- Sorry.

197
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,720
I ironed it on purpose.
- Yes, I'm sorry.

198
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:33,200
Shall we lie down
199
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,720
Are you not going to the party ?

200
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:41,920
Come on, lie down for a minute.

201
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,720
There, a fish. That means "thin"
and that means "down".

202
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,680
I don't get this game.

203
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,560
Strange.

204
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,920
We were always tracking back then.

205
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,880
Come here. Sit down.

206
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,720
Have a look at the other leg.

207
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:48,440
How nice of her.
I almost can't take it.

208
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:58,680
I'm the only one left. You are all going 
to Paris and God knows where...

209
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:03,200
Don't start crying now.
- Sorry.

210
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,600
Please.
- If you want me to leave, just say so.

211
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,200
I thought you wanted to take a bath.

212
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,760
Another arrow. And another.

213
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,000
Could you...

214
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,520
How can I help ?
- loose this.

215
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,720
I have beautiful buttocks.
Don't they get more then a bath ?

216
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,040
Look, there.

217
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:25,080
The other side.
Wher the light is attached.

218
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,880
Dear finder of this letter.
You must be...

219
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,960
Jezus.

220
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,720
There's nothing in it.

221
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,960
Damn.

222
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,080
Did you put all that soap here ?

223
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,360
Damn.

224
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,200
Why is all that soap here ?

225
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,600
You used it yourself.

226
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,040
Shit.
- Did you hurt yourself?

227
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,120
Ofcourse I hurt myself.

228
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:45,080
There have always been ghosts here.
It makes no sense.

229
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,600
I'll sleep here.
Thank you for your help.

230
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,040
Where you really scared ?
- O, no.

231
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,800
a little ? Sorry.
Thanks for your help.

232
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:04,800
Why was that soap there ?
- You did that yourself.

233
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,480
No I didn't.
- You used it.

234
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,680
Where are my trousers ?
- How should I know. There?

235
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:17,600
For once take care of your stuff.
I'm not a babysit.

236
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:23,480
Shut up.
- Please, come on.

237
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,760
The damn thing has come down.

238
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,360
Then don't hang it up again.
- Hell not.

239
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,680
Fun, You used to be the one to argue

240
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,960
Now it's your brother.

241
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,480
You don't even look at beautiful girls.

242
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,600
You think I'm too skinny.

243
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,960
I'll hide it here.
No one should find it.

244
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,800
There.

245
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,960
Where have you gone,
dear Christian ?

246
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,080
6 o'clock. Time to get up.

247
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:10,800
Tickets, please.
Or other papers...

248
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,840
My pants.

249
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,440
Hello, grandpa.
- Hi, dad.

250
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,040
In five minutes in the livingroom.

251
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,920
Damn shoes.

252
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,080
Everything okay.

253
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,520
Hello Poul, you're okay ?

254
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,800
Hello, dad.

255
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,360
It'll be fine.
We have to go in now.

256
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:07,840
I've been told to ask you if 
you're interested in the lodge.


257
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:12,480
It just doesn't look like it's 
something you're interested in. 

258
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,480
but Christian recommended you to
Preben. He isn't interested himself.

259
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,760
So I guess they'll ask you for the 
freemasons.

260
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:29,120
Bend the iron while it's still hot.

261
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,400
We will help you to get on.

262
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:37,200
But behave like a normal person tonight.

263
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,160
And keep your hands of
whats-her-name , Michelle.

264
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,240
Will you take care of things tonight?

265
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,680
Can you ?

266
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,840
Give him something to drink.

267
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,600
Watch out.
Do you have a drink already ?

268
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,480
Do you have a drink already ?
- We have to talk.

269
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,960
I don't have time.

270
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,920
You do remember something ?

271
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:03,520
Sure.
- Fine.

272
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:10,240
I think I'll make a speech tonight.

273
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,520
I thought so.

274
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,800
Not suited for little girls.

275
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,880
I bet.

276
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,280
You were fallen asleep.

277
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,880
Don't you sleep well ?

278
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,880
Only when you're here.

279
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,040
I'm honoured to be master of 
ceremonies...

280
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:51,880
on this party of 
Klingenfeldt-Hansen family.

281
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,000
My name is Helmuth von Sachs.

282
00:28:55,160 --> 00:29:00,360
I'm from Germany.
Cologne, "Ruhr-area", steel industry.

283
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,480
Helge is also a man of steel.
Unbreakable.

284
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:14,000
Helge, friend, Danish stepfather,
the audience is yours.

285
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:33,080
As I see you all in front of me,
I have to think about recent years...

286
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,280
and everything that happened.

287
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:44,360
It's not special turning 60.

288
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,720
It all seems like yesterday...

289
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:55,120
the moment we closed the negotiations 
and bought the landed estates.

290
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:00,720
Still, it was 1971...

291
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:07,880
the year our family walked up the stairs.

292
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,080
My beloved wife, Helene...

293
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,160
Michael, the twins...

294
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,200
Yes, the twins.

295
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,560
All of us we settled in this 
beautiful house.

296
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,440
We had...

297
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,760
high expectations.

298
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,040
I'll stop here.

299
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:47,080
Let's make it a wonderful party.
Let's eat.

300
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,800
First course.
Ready... go.

301
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,280
There.

302
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,640
Wasn't it a beautiful ride ?
- It was extremely hot.

303
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:26,040
You do have airconditioning ?
- It gets me a dry mouth.

304
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,720
It doesn't feel comfortable.

305
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,600
The kids are here too.

306
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,600
Give me a little water.

307
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:14,360
I'm all wet.
She spilled.

308
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,800
What's your name, girl ?
- I'm Mette.

309
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,480
M-E-T-T-E.
- That's true.

310
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:33,040
Lobstersoup. Delicious.
- No, it's salmonsoup.

311
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,520
Salmon ?
It tastes like lobster though.

312
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:44,080
It's delicious soup.
- Yes, tomatosoup.

313
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,320
It's no tomatosoup..
It is lobstersoup.

314
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,520
Exactly.
- Cheers.

315
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,760
Oldest son holds speech.
Morten...

316
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,320
It is almost seven and I would like 
to propose the first toast.

317
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:10,560
That's my duty after all
as the oldest son. Isn't it Helmuth ?

318
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,920
But first a speech.

319
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,360
I've written two, dad.

320
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:22,200
A green and a yellow.
You may choose.

321
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,800
Green or Yellow ?
- Green.

322
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,520
That's a good choice.

323
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:37,000
It's a confession speech
It's called: when dad goes in bath.

324
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:43,720
When we moved here,
I was still small.

325
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:48,360
Our lives changed entirely.

326
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:53,960
We had lots of space to do 
naughty things.

327
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:58,160
In those days this room was
a restaurant...

328
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,520
and I don't know how often my sister Linda,
who is dead now...

329
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,080
and I played here.

330
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:11,480
She put things in the food,
but no one noticed...

331
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:16,360
And then we had and she laughed.

332
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,560
She had a great laugh...

333
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,240
and pretty soon we were both 
laughing out loud.

334
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,440
That's how we got caught.
But we never got punishment.

335
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:34,840
It was much more dangerous 
when dad took a bath.

336
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,760
He took a bath quite often.

337
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:46,400
First he called for Linda and me to come
because something happened before bathing.

338
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,000
He closed the door and the curtains.

339
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:56,040
Then he undressed 
and we had to undress too.

340
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:00,640
He put us on the green couch...

341
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,920
and raped us.
He used us sexually.

342
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,480
When my sister passed away
 a couple of months ago...

343
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,320
I thought: Isn't Helge a proper girl, 
with all the bathing..

344
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,040
That's what I wanted to share with you.

345
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,720
He bathed in the summer, winter,
in the morning, in the evening...

346
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,760
He's very clean.
That's what I wanted to tell you.

347
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,760
It's his 60'th birthday, 
after all.

348
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,480
He watched his children and 
grandchildren grow up.

349
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,920
But you're not here for my speech...

350
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:47,520
But for Helge's 60'th birthday.

351
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,200
Thanks for all the wonderful years.

352
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,440
Happy birthday.

353
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,720
I have nothing to drink.
Fill the glasses.

354
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:29,400
Christian, you were always the first 
ofcourse. But now it's my turn.

355
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,120
Elsie, It's your birthday today.

356
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,480
Helge.
- What's he saying ?

357
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,760
That it's Helge birthday today.

358
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,320
Helge, it's your birthday. That's nice.

359
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:53,240
You're a big boy now. You can handle 
the story of the seven seas now.

360
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,400
Way to go, grandpa.
- I have to leave.

361
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,520
When Helge was a little boy...

362
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,040
He told me once he couldn't find 
a girlfriend.

363
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,840
Kim...

364
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:23,360
Hello, Christian.
- Hello. I've got to catch my plane.

365
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,640
Attention.
This is my childhood friend Christian.

366
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,840
You already know most of them.

367
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,600
How do you do ?

368
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,120
Good.
- Everything fine ?

369
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:43,880
Good. You held your speech and 
now you're going home

370
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:49,040
The battle is lost.
Nothing has changed.

371
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,240
Are you drunk ?
- Otherwise I can't cook.

372
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,240
How long do we know eachother ?
Since the year nil ?

373
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,320
We used to steal apples together.

374
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:06,400
I've waited for years for this 
and now you're walking away.

375
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:11,760
For your father, who decided on yours 
and your sisters fate..

376
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,200
Brilliant, to let him decide 
on his fate in your speech..

377
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,200
What's your point, Kim ?

378
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,360
I would like to say something too.

379
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,400
I hope you won't take Christian
too seriously.

380
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:33,600
He's my brother
and I love him very much...

381
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,200
but his story is not completely true.
and I should know.

382
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,160
Sorry that I speak up so late,
but I'm still shocked.

383
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,800
At a quarter past seven,
your father will give me instructions.

384
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,080
He'll say:
I think they like it.

385
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,000
And then he drinks a drop.

386
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,680
Give me two minutes.

387
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,760
I thought you had left already.

388
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:32,320
A drink for me and my son.

389
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,360
The food is delicious.

390
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,120
They liked the first course.

391
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,640
Here.
- No, thank you.

392
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,320
You don't want it ?

393
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,560
It tastes good. Damn good.

394
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,120
I take your word.

395
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:57,360
Have one too and put the bottle away.
Come. Alone.

396
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,480
Come.

397
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,360
How are you doing ?
- Good.

398
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,440
Really ?

399
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,720
Really ?

400
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:22,040
I don't understand it.

401
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:27,720
I can't remember.
- What do you mean ?

402
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,520
What you told...
I can't remember.

403
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:36,800
Help me here.
What has happened ?

404
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:46,000
I'm sorry. I guess I'm wrong.

405
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:49,240
Don't apologize.

406
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:55,400
I'm kind of busy at work.
And then there's Linda...

407
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,240
Don't think about it.

408
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:03,080
Where you're aiming at, is a crime.
We have to go to the police.

409
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,640
No, we don't.
Don't think about it anymore.

410
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:13,440
I don't sleep well, lately.
I feel a bit strange.

411
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:18,280
Everything alright upstairs?
- Yes, fine.

412
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:22,200
They're not shocked that easily.
Everything's okay.

413
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,080
Have a good journey and thanks 
for being here.

414
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,840
I have to go back.

415
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:58,560
Helge, it's your birthday today.
- not again, grandpa.

416
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:07,160
You're a big boy now. You can handle 
the story about the seven seas.

417
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,280
When Helge was a little boy...

418
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:20,160
He told me he couldn't get 
a girlfriend.

419
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,240
I told him, listen boy...

420
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:28,320
buy a big potatoe
and stick it in your swimmingtrunk.

421
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:33,560
Then you'll go to the lake.
They will push eachother aside for you.

422
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,560
When the summer came...

423
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,960
What do you think ?
- Me ?

424
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:44,280
I don't know what he's up to.

425
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:53,520
He was desperate.
It was even worse then before.

426
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,600
No one wanted to talk to him.
Obviously, I said.

427
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:03,880
You have to stick that potatoe
in the front.

428
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:22,520
Michelle, Pia, I want to say something.

429
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,000
Come here. Listen.

430
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,000
We steal their carkeys.

431
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,920
We ?
- Okay.

432
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:38,440
This night is for Christian.
They can't go home yet.

433
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,480
But he apologized.

434
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:47,600
We'll wait.
Don't tell the old servants.

435
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,560
And now get out.

436
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,520
We can't leave any traces.
- No, we're careful.

437
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,280
I got them.

438
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,880
Next.

439
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,680
Everything okay ?

440
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,840
Are there any problems ?

441
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,360
No, everything's fine.

442
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:24,080
Is my brother staying over ?
- I don't know.

443
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,840
There's a cab.
I'll take a look.

444
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:46,720
Hello, Charlie Brown.
You're wrong here.

445
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,640
Do you speak English?

446
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:53,520
It's a private party.
Not for passengers.

447
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,720
I'm invited.
- Can I leave ?

448
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,440
One moment.

449
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:04,160
We don't need any music.
No trumpet.

450
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:09,640
Ga home. Here,  500 kronen.
That's for the cab too.

451
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,720
Go home.
- I'm not playing. I'm invited.

452
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,920
You're not Helene's brother ?

453
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:25,040
I don't know how you know my sister
and I don't even want to know...

454
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,640
Hello. I've missed you so.

455
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,320
Good to see you here.

456
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:39,200
What are you doing here ?
- He tried to send me away.

457
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:45,000
What's happening ?
- Behave yourself.

458
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:50,320
How dare you invite that monkey 
on my fathers birthday?

459
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:55,880
How dare you call Gbatokai a monkey.
- Relax.

460
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:00,160
Filthy nazi.

461
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,040
Go.

462
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:30,360
Mum, this is my friend, Gbatokai.
This is my mother.

463
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,840
Welcome. Nice to see you again.

464
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,200
You never met him.
That was someone else.

465
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,600
Nice to meet you.
- Same here.

466
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,600
Good. This way.

467
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,880
I almost forgot the most important.

468
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,280
We're gathered here for my fathers 
birthday.

469
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,480
I fooled you all.

470
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:14,000
I would like to propose a toast
to my father.

471
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,920
Could everyone rise please ?
- Well done, Christian.

472
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:25,160
Lift your glasses.

473
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,200
To the man who killed my sister.

474
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,560
To a murderer.

475
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,760
I suggest we take a break .

476
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,840
Cigarettes, hurry up.

477
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,080
Hurry up.

478
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,840
Play something. Something light.

479
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,000
Play.

480
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:08,920
We'll stay for a minute.
We can't leave anyway.

481
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,440
Have you lost your mind ?

482
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,160
Do you hear me ?

483
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,880
Have you completely lost your mind ?

484
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:38,560
Make sure no one leaves.
He's sick, for christ'sake.

485
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:46,280
Again, I've called...

486
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,560
I want a taxi.
- one minute.

487
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,280
I can't stand this.

488
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,680
I'm already depressed.

489
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:57,960
There won't be a cab. I'll walk.

490
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:01,480
I'm fed up with their parties.

491
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,840
Do you know where the car keys are?

492
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,400
I can't find the keys.
- Problems ?

493
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:15,240
I can't take it.
I'm already depressed.

494
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,160
The line's still busy.

495
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:22,960
The waiting-time is 11 months.
- Could I have Kim please ?

496
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:27,560
Take it easy, Lars.

497
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,320
Hide those keys.
- In the oven.

498
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,200
No, in the refrigerator.

499
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,440
They're gone.

500
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,600
Where is Michelle, damn it ?

501
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,920
Come in, damn it.

502
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,720
I want to have a word with you. 
And you.

503
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,320
Go away.
- I want to talk to you.

504
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:59,160
Do you know what happened, Mette ?
- Come.

505
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,960
This way.

506
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,440
Let go.
- Take it easy.

507
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:11,680
What do you want fro me ?
- Last year you promissed me something.

508
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,160
Then you came at night.

509
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,280
And now you won't even talk to me.

510
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,440
I'm sorry. But my wife is here too.

511
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,560
She used to be unimportant.

512
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,200
I got pregnant that time.

513
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:32,920
I had it removed.
But you should know.

514
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:38,320
My father turns sixty today 
and everything is out of control.

515
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,840
Hey there.

516
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,640
Hello, Bent. Is this your room ?

517
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:50,680
I was just leaving.
Have you seen my car keys ?

518
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,080
I'll just look around if I see them.

519
00:50:55,320 --> 00:51:00,920
You really haven't seen them ?
If I don't find them, I'll get depressed.

520
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:06,280
I know. Just go downstairs.

521
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,720
Pack your things and go home.

522
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:16,120
Here's your wage. Now fuck off.

523
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:21,400
You're as crazy as your father.

524
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,000
I won't let you piss of my family.

525
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,200
Imagine I hold a speech.

526
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,240
About you.

527
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:13,040
About how unstable you where.

528
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,800
That you always spoiled everything 
for other children.

529
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,840
Burned their toys.

530
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,280
That you've always been a complete
lunatic.

531
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:27,800
That we had to come to France...

532
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:31,160
where they kept you in a mental 
institution...

533
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:36,280
because you were completely crazy 
and drugged.

534
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,840
at despair of your mother.

535
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,960
That you were extremely uncomfortable
with women.

536
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:45,320
Year after year you passed on 
beautiful women...

537
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:49,680
because your a man of nothing.

538
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:54,480
I could tell about your sister,
you and your sister.

539
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,920
What about that ?

540
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:03,080
Did she say goodbye to you?

541
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,640
Was there a card or a letter? No.

542
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:13,960
For the others though.
She must have had her reasons.

543
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:18,680
You just abandoned here.
Like always.

544
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,400
You abandoned your sick sister.

545
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:28,480
She kept asking about you and 
runned for the phone...

546
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,560
but you never called.

547
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,840
You were only interested in yourself.

548
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:41,200
And now you're dissing your family.
While we just want to see you happy.

549
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:44,600
Your mother wants you to leave.

550
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,720
I think you should stay.

551
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:52,560
Then you know how it feels to 
blacken your family.

552
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:03,600
After this little pianical intermezzo...

553
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,440
table's ready again.

554
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,800
I'm hungry.

555
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:13,000
May I ask you ?

556
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:27,240
They're ready.
Christian doesn't look happy.

557
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:31,640
haunch of venison and cranberry's. Go ahead.

558
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,800
cheers, grandpa.

559
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,960
You speeched wonderfully.

560
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:56,040
Don't shout in my ear.

561
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,600
You still got us.

562
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,280
Salt and pepper. Cheers.

563
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:32,840
Champagne. I want champagne and caviar.

564
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Hello, Christian.

565
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:58,480
Looks like you're very popular with 
the servants.

566
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:04,760
Sometimes it gives good results 
if you stir things up.

567
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:09,800
The way you dare to say with all 
the servants around:

568
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:15,560
Mum, dad, you're no good.

569
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,480
I'm sorry.

570
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:37,240
Keep up with it just a little longer.
If you only survive this evening.

571
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:03,360
If the birthdayboy is my Danish father...

572
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:07,560
then Elsie is my Danish mother.

573
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,120
She is everybodies "Mutti".

574
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:14,440
Elsie, the word is yours.
Applause, please.

575
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:23,040
Thanks Helmuth and the others.

576
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:30,760
I would like to thank you all
for coming today.

577
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:39,040
And I would like to say some 
thankful words to my husband, Helge.

578
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:44,360
It's not easy. Words can not 
describe...

579
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,880
how much you still mean to me.

580
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:53,320
Besides your lust for life
and good care for your family...

581
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:58,880
you've gave me everything a woman
can ask for.

582
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:04,200
It has been 30 wonderful years.
Thank you very much.

583
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:13,120
I would also like to say a few 
words to the children.

584
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:20,000
It is wonderful to see you're
all doing well...

585
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:25,720
Especially when I think how small
you all have been.

586
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:31,920
Michael, you're our youngest.
the benjamin.

587
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,880
We've never seen much of you.

588
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:41,440
You went to boarding-school when
you were still a little boy.

589
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:47,320
And after that to the hotel
school in Switzerland.

590
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:53,720
You never became a cook,
but that can still be.

591
00:58:53,840 --> 00:59:00,520
You're given us 3 wonderful
grandchildren.

592
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:04,440
And we're thankful for that.

593
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:09,080
And ofcourse little Mette.

594
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:14,160
And Helene,
the "weirdo" of the family .

595
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,120
That's what you are ?

596
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:21,560
Ever since you told us you wanted
to become a singer...

597
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:26,960
and you joined the Trotsk...
the socialistic youth...

598
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,760
we knew you would go your own way.

599
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:33,080
and you have.

600
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,560
in life and in studdy.

601
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:39,960
You've become an antropologist.

602
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:46,000
though we hoped you'd gone to
lawschool.

603
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,640
But there are hardly any cultures and 
countries...

604
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:57,880
which you didn't visit.

605
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,560
With this I want to welcome your
boyfriend to the family. Gonzales.

606
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:07,600
His name is Gbatokai.

607
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:13,080
Welcome, Kai.

608
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:17,160
And then we have Christian.

609
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:23,520
You were always very special.
a creative child.

610
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:27,000
He made up some wonderful stories.

611
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:34,200
I always saw him a great writer.

612
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:38,600
When Christian was little,
and only few know...

613
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:43,480
he had a loyal friend, mug...

614
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:47,040
who didn't exist.

615
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:51,000
Mug and Christian
could not be seperated.

616
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:55,120
If Mug didn't want something,
then Christian would neither.

617
01:00:55,240 --> 01:01:01,160
And no one could change that.

618
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,360
But, dear Christian...

619
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:09,000
You have to seperate reality 
from fiction.

620
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:13,120
You were never good at that.

621
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:20,120
Ofcourse you're sometimes angry of
your father. I am sometimes too.

622
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:23,880
But you'll have to solve that between 
the both of you.

623
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,160
You've told us exiting stories tonight...

624
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:35,080
maybe a bit too exiting.

625
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:40,920
I think Mug was with you tonight.

626
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:44,520
You've scared daddy very much.

627
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:48,680
It seems apropriate to me if you 
stand up now...

628
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,680
without Mug...

629
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:53,600
and apologize yourself.

630
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:58,120
It's not a shame to apologize 
yourself.

631
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,480
It's even good.

632
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,800
So just rise please.

633
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:14,080
Come on, Christian. Do something.

634
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:18,200
He is confused.
- Christian.

635
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:50,160
Sorry to bother you again.

636
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:54,240
In 1974 my mother entered the 
study once.

637
01:02:54,360 --> 01:03:00,040
Her son was on his knees.
Her husband had his pants down.

638
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:04,200
Her husband said, go away.
And she did.

639
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:09,480
You are so hypocrite.
Please just die.

640
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:13,880
That you assholes even listen to this 
woman.

641
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,160
I'm sorry that you all for thirty
years...

642
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:22,080
Let me finish.
- Let's go.

643
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:27,880
Relax, man. Let's go outside.

644
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,600
Give me my coat.
- You'll get your coat.

645
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:41,040
You were ate school. You knew nothing.

646
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:44,480
But now you know.

647
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:48,200
You're crossing the line.
- Now you know. Don't you ?

648
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:53,000
You're going to far. Fuck of.
- Go away.

649
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:58,800
Lock the door.

650
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:04,120
Is it locked ?
- I think so.

651
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:47,920
Where was I?

652
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,200
Mother, my loyal witness.

653
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:55,920
In 1974 you saw how father
rubbed his hard cock through my hair...

654
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:58,600
Filthy bastard.

655
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:03,360
You're an asshole.
- Fuck of.

656
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:05,840
Assholes.

657
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:09,360
He's not okay.

658
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:13,240
Sad, go on mother.

659
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:17,720
ther's a quite idyll 

660
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:21,360
in the lonelyness of the forest

661
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:25,080
where troubles are taken away

662
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:29,320
where silence and piece reigned

663
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,120
Throw him of the stairs.

664
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:41,360
Get lost, man.
Get the hell out of here.

665
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:47,240
Don't, Leif. He's still my brother.

666
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:50,600
Go away.

667
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:02,440
Get him.

668
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,840
Christian, come here.

669
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:09,920
The game is over. Is that clear?

670
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:26,280
Have you had enough ?
Not with that, he's my brother.

671
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,360
Come.
- Where are we going?

672
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:34,280
To the forest.
This has got to stop.

673
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:40,280
How far ?
- As long as we'll get rid of him.

674
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:43,640
What do you mean?
- Shut up. Here.

675
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,520
We'll leave him there by the tree.

676
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:55,240
Damn. That's alright.

677
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:03,920
Do we really have to tie you to this
tree, Christian ?

678
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:09,640
How did you come up with all that 
nonsense?

679
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:18,160
Come on.

680
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,160
Let's go.

681
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:26,440
Come on.
- Shut your mouth.

682
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:30,760
Did you tie him?
I've had enough of this.

683
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,200
Slow down.
- That's good enough.

684
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:37,760
Keep quite, Christian.

685
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:01,040
Do you have a smoke for me?
I dropped mine.

686
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:06,360
I'll just check if the doors are locked.

687
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:11,880
Where's your brother ?
- I won't talk to him.

688
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,520
What have you done with him ?
- Relax.

689
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,120
I had a word with him. He's gone home.

690
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:22,960
He was sorry. 
You'll hear the rest later.

691
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:27,760
So you put him to bed and said 
goodnight.

692
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:30,920
Are you looking for trouble?
- Piece of shit.

693
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:36,800
Stop it, Michael.

694
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:40,640
What did you say ?
- Stop it, Michael.

695
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:44,240
Stop it, damnit.

696
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:47,120
Get out..

697
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,320
Hello, Kim.
- Hey, Leif.

698
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:59,400
We should lock the backdoor.
Where is it?

699
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:02,880
That way.

700
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:06,880
It's not good.

701
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,840
You didn't hit him?
- He's not coming back.

702
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:13,600
Here it is.

703
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:17,040
This is the wineceller.
- Exactly. There.

704
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:23,840
What's this ?
Kim, what are you doing ?

705
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,640
Did you lock him up ?

706
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:29,600
All these troublemakers running around...

707
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:37,040
Don't touch.
- Where is Christian ?

708
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:39,080
No idea.

709
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:01,960
Don't get drunk now.

710
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,760
To your brother.

711
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:13,080
To your brother.
- What's that ?

712
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:18,360
To your brother.
- Why no speech ?

713
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:22,120
A speech ?
I know what that's like here.

714
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:23,760
Watch out, or I'll do it.

715
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:27,760
Time for a happy song.

716
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:34,320
I saw a little nigger just lately...

717
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:35,840
a racist song.

718
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:43,160
he talked really weird and
had a ring through his nose.

719
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:47,200
I asked him what kind are you ?

720
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:51,600
why are your legs covered with tar ?

721
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:55,080
he smiled and said:

722
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:58,520
It looks like a christmas song.

723
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:05,680
fidliha kola tomrassi gassi bum
the black mass comes from Umblagidarum

724
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:09,240
I saw a little Indian just lately...

725
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:12,600
his face was fire-red

726
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:15,880
he talked very weird.

727
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:21,680
I can't stand it.
They'll kill eachother.

728
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:23,840
I'm going crazy.

729
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:35,160
I've got a terrible headache.
Could you get me my pills ?

730
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:43,280
Hve you seen Christian ?
- He's gone home.

731
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:49,400
That's good.
- I'm going to get your pills.

732
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,600
You are all crazy, aah ,my head.

733
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:57,560
Aren't you drunk yet?
- It takes a lot.

734
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:00,960
It's almost ten o'clock.

735
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:05,120
Something special is going to happen
in a minute.

736
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:23,480
Alfred Hitchcock wanted on his
grave:

737
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:27,200
That's the way it ends with 
naughty boys.

738
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:32,360
Helge, you too will not escape the 
strange traditions of this family.

739
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:34,920
Time for the big finale.

740
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:42,040
It's daddy's birthday today

741
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:45,800
daddy's birthday today

742
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,480
listen...

743
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:52,080
how we play the trumpet

744
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:06,080
it's daddy's birthday today,
listen...

745
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:09,720
how we play the flute

746
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,560
You've dropped something.
Be carefull for once.

747
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:40,440
I want to go home.
- I can imagine that.

748
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:45,720
Are you leaving already ?

749
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:52,160
I want to go home.
- Don't be foolish. There's still dessert.

750
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:59,440
Listen. It's going to be okay.

751
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:02,080
Trust me.

752
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:04,200
I can feel it.

753
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,640
Really ?
- Come.

754
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:31,640
Doesn't this family have some
neat traditions.

755
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:37,600
After the polonaise the master of
ceremonies finds a note on his glass.
756
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:41,360
And that's also the way it is today.

757
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:44,720
A man asks his sister...

758
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:49,640
to read a letter to her father.

759
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:57,840
Helene is a bit too shy to do it
herself, isn't that so Helene?

760
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:01,240
Whatever...

761
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:06,520
it's sweet of your brother
that he helps you to get started.

762
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:12,840
I think piece has returned to the 
family.

763
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:18,560
Applause for Helene, please.

764
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:31,240
Go ahead, Helene.

765
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:39,520
Don't be shy.

766
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:50,480
Michael, just ignore him.

767
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,480
He is...

768
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:02,200
He is from my sister.

769
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:08,840
Dear finder of this letter.

770
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:13,120
You are probably my sister or my 
brother.

771
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:17,240
Because you're good in tracking.

772
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,920
Hi-hi, laughter-laughter.

773
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:28,200
I know it's scary to find me in a bath
full of water.

774
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,800
But it's not scary for me.

775
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:45,720
My brothers and my sister...

776
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:49,400
are happy, gay people.

777
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:54,360
I love you.

778
01:18:56,600 --> 01:19:00,520
Don't think too much of me.

779
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:05,760
Christian, sweet brother...

780
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:11,120
You were alway here with me.
Thanks for everything.

781
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:16,040
I don't want you to get involved.
I love you too much for that.

782
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:21,560
And you, Helene
and you too Michael, idiot.

783
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,800
Daddy is raping me again.

784
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:37,600
In my dreams, again.
I can't take it anymore.

785
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:42,920
I'll leave.

786
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:47,480
I should've done it much earlier.

787
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:52,400
I know I will fill your life with
darkness, Christian.

788
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:57,200
I tried to call you...

789
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:59,760
but I know you're busy.

790
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:05,520
I don't want you to feel sad.

791
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:13,240
I think it's light and beautiful on
the other side.

792
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:16,160
I'm looking forward to it.

793
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:19,560
Although I'm a bit scared too.

794
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:25,080
I'm scared to go without you.

795
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:30,240
I 'll love you eternaly.

796
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:33,440
Linda.

797
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:48,600
What a beautifull letter.
Give her port...

798
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:52,240
so we can raise our glasses.

799
01:20:55,520 --> 01:21:00,440
Pour my daughter some port,
so we can raise glasses too.

800
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:09,000
Pour my daughter some port,
so we can raise glasses too.


801
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:14,600
Give her port, damnit.

802
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:19,080
Give her port.
Show some respect.

803
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:23,120
Have you ever seen something like this.

804
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:26,480
What are you looking at. Well ?

805
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:31,400
Is it my fault my children have no talent?

806
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:37,480
I never understood why you did it.

807
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:40,840
You were no good for anything else.

808
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:23,960
It's not easy being master of
ceremonies tonight.

809
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:28,160
And it's my first time too.

810
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:31,640
I'm pretty drunk.

811
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:34,760
Like all of us.

812
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:38,200
And still I consider it...
- I'm leaving.

813
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:41,840
my duty to finish diner in a positive
way.

814
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:48,360
So let's go on and have some coffee and
cake.

815
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:45,320
Goodnight.

816
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:49,880
I've put the carkeys back.

817
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,360
Can I have a glass of water?

818
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:55,440
Shall I call a doctor ?

819
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:01,840
Are you okay ?

820
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:03,800
Come.

821
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:56,480
I was sleeping.

822
01:24:57,680 --> 01:25:01,960
Pia, my sister is here.
I love you.

823
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,720
I miss you.

824
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:38,200
I miss you too.

825
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:40,160
Shall I come with you ?

826
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:44,840
I'm off again.

827
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:17,280
It's Helene.
- What time is it ?

828
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:20,680
Three o'clock. I slept too.

829
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:26,400
If you can call it sleeping.
You know... I have...

830
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:31,120
Maybe you too.

831
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:36,280
What do you mean?
- Forget it.

832
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:40,200
Come here. Michael is gone.

833
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:52,320
What's going on ?

834
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:58,720
He's gone and his wife is furious.
She's in my room.

835
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:04,160
Is the party still going on ?
- I don't think so.

836
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:11,560
Don't worry.

837
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:20,400
They've all gone to bed.

838
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:25,120
Where are the glasses?
Where is Michelle ?

839
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:29,760
With Kim.
Everybody sleeps in a wrong bed.

840
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:35,040
Not us, ey darling ?
We don't do that.

841
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:37,760
We don't sleep in the wrong bed.

842
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:41,680
I have a glass for Christian.
- I want one too.

843
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:45,240
As long as it's not someone else's.

844
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,400
Play the weddingmars.

845
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:05,600
Gbatokai and Helene must dance.

846
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:17,160
Because I think you should get married.

847
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:31,960
Dad ?

848
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:40,200
It's me, Michael. I'm on my way.

849
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:55,120
Open up.
I'm the postman, damnit.

850
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:02,720
Open up, damn it.

851
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:08,560
Open up.

852
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:18,840
Go inside and close the door.

853
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:23,840
Michael, stop it.

854
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:28,200
Stop it.
- Go back inside.

855
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:33,720
Shut up, I said.

856
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:43,520
I told you to shut up.

857
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:05,480
Come.

858
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:14,200
Lie down.

859
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:22,560
And stay down.

860
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:29,920
I heard enough filth.
Lie down, I said.

861
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:37,280
I won't see your grandchildren again.

862
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:41,040
Never again, is that clear?

863
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:47,600
You destroyed the family.

864
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:50,680
Lie.

865
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:53,280
lie down, I said.

866
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:02,320
It's me. Michael.
I'm ringing the frontdoorbell.

867
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:42,360
It can't happen.

868
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:44,840
Be quite.

869
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:49,360
What's wrong ?
- It can't happen.

870
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:52,400
What's wrong ?

871
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:56,600
They need to stop.

872
01:31:56,720 --> 01:32:02,640
Go there, Gbatokai.
- Your father...

873
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:07,360
Stop it, Michael.

874
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:22,600
You're killing me.

875
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:27,360
You're killing me.

876
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:52,280
Ober, could I have something to drink ?

877
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:58,040
I like to start the day with a drink.

878
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:22,520
Morten, what are you thinking of ?

879
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:30,120
O... it's happened.

880
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:40,040
At least she's feeling okay.

881
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:50,120
Goodmorning.

882
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:54,360
Goodmorning.
- Have a sandwich.

883
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,880
Where is Leif, damnit ?
O, there you are.

884
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:03,440
How's your wig ?
- Wher do you have your clothes 
wrinkled?

885
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:06,600
In Naestved.

886
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:21,200
Would you like to come live with me
in Paris ?

887
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:27,800
I'd love to.

888
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:31,840
That was all.

889
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:43,680
Hey, are you in love with the new waitress?

890
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:48,560
Shut up and eat.
- I will eat a loaf of bread.

891
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:57,080
Goodmorning.

892
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:02,640
Goodmorning everyone. Enjoy your breakfast.

893
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:20,560
Dorthe, come to grandpa.

894
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:24,240
Your father will read it to you.

895
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:46,800
I know that this is not the right moment.
You're all having breakfast.

896
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:51,280
I'll keep it short.

897
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:56,960
I only want to say that I know...

898
01:35:57,080 --> 01:36:00,560
That I,
When all of you have gone home...

899
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:05,920
never will see you again.

900
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:11,160
And I understand now...

901
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:16,600
that it's unforgivable
what I've done to my children.

902
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:20,760
And I know that all of you...

903
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:24,280
and especially my children...

904
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:28,000
will hate me for the rest of my 
live.

905
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:34,280
Still, you'll always be my children.

906
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:38,640
I always loved you and will keep
doing so for the rest of my life...

907
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:45,600
where ever in this world you may be.

908
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:52,160
Christian, to you I would like to say...

909
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,800
you put up a good fight.

910
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:03,360
Thank you.

911
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:30,600
That was a beautiful speech.

912
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:35,560
But now you'll have to leave.
So we can have breakfast in peace.

913
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:38,280
Ofcourse.

914
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:45,120
Are you coming ?
- I stay here.

915
01:37:50,000 --> 01:38:00,000
