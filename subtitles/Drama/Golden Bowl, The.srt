1
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Nick Nack! Tabasco!

2
00:01:45,249 --> 00:01:49,040
Right away, Monsieur Scaramanga!

3
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:16,492
Hey.

4
00:02:17,908 --> 00:02:22,365
Half. You get the rest later.

5
00:02:28,156 --> 00:02:32,321
Wait for him in there. Through that door.

6
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:37,528
He will join you in a minute.

7
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,146
Your steam bath is ready,
Monsieur Scaramanga.

8
00:04:12,505 --> 00:04:16,254
<i>Oh, that would have been too easy.</i>

9
00:04:16,504 --> 00:04:19,837
<i>It's locked.</i>

10
00:04:20,087 --> 00:04:24,336
You'll have to look elsewhere, monsieur.

11
00:05:49,232 --> 00:05:50,690
Hey, Al.

12
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,897
Al, wherever you are,
don't hold it against me.

13
00:06:02,645 --> 00:06:07,269
I wonder where you can find your gun,
Monsieur Scaramanga.

14
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:11,726
<i>Your little golden gun.</i>

15
00:06:14,642 --> 00:06:18,267
<i>Where can it be?</i>

16
00:06:19,766 --> 00:06:24,015
<i>There is something
we haven't had before.</i>

17
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:29,014
<i>I wonder what it can be.</i>

18
00:06:32,763 --> 00:06:36,387
<i>I fooled you!</i>

19
00:06:39,761 --> 00:06:43,385
<i>You're getting warmer.</i>

20
00:06:44,885 --> 00:06:48,509
<i>Much warmer.</i>

21
00:07:11,795 --> 00:07:16,336
Now, how are you going
to get down the stairs?

22
00:07:16,586 --> 00:07:21,210
<i>So near and yet so far.</i>

23
00:07:43,704 --> 00:07:46,287
<i>Bravo, Monsieur Scaramanga.</i>

24
00:07:46,537 --> 00:07:50,161
You've done it again.

25
00:07:52,494 --> 00:07:56,284
- This one was the best, "n'est-ce pas"?
- Not bad. Not bad at all.

26
00:07:56,534 --> 00:07:59,284
But you'll have to do better
to come into my money.

27
00:07:59,534 --> 00:08:03,574
I'll get you yet,
and I'll enjoy every sou you leave me.

28
00:08:03,824 --> 00:08:07,657
You'll be the death of me yet, Nick Nack.

29
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,983
<i># He has a powerful weapon</i>

30
00:08:36,233 --> 00:08:39,982
<i># He charges a million a shot</i>

31
00:08:40,232 --> 00:08:44,481

<i># With his golden gun</i>

60
00:10:45,743 --> 00:10:49,367
Good morning, sir.

61
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:52,367
Colthorpe.

62
00:10:52,617 --> 00:10:54,241
Chief of Staff.

63
00:10:54,491 --> 00:10:57,115
What do you know
about a man called Scaramanga, 007?

64
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,990
Scaramanga?

65
00:11:01,281 --> 00:11:04,114
Oh, yes! The Man with the Golden Gun.

66
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:08,946
Born in a circus. Father, the ringmaster.
Mother, English. A snake charmer.

67
00:11:09,196 --> 00:11:14,736
A spectacular trick-shot artist by the time
he was ten and a local Rio gunman at 15.

68
00:11:14,986 --> 00:11:18,569
The KGB trained him in Europe,
where he became

69
00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:20,943
an overworked, underpaid assassin.

70
00:11:21,193 --> 00:11:23,692
He went independent in the '50s.

71
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:26,233
Current price: One million dollars a hit.

72
00:11:26,483 --> 00:11:28,608
No... er... photograph on file.

73
00:11:28,858 --> 00:11:33,732
But he does have one distinguishing
feature, however. A superfluous papilla.

74
00:11:33,982 --> 00:11:39,105
- A what?
- A mammary gland. A third nipple, sir.

75
00:11:39,355 --> 00:11:42,604
He always uses a golden bullet,
hence "Man with the Golden Gun".

76
00:11:42,854 --> 00:11:44,854
Present domicile unknown.

77
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,770
I think that's all.

78
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:51,769
Why, sir?

79
00:11:52,644 --> 00:11:55,935
Hm! Charming trinket.

80
00:11:56,184 --> 00:11:58,642
- Even has my number on it.
- Precisely.

81
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:01,683
Obviously it's useless as a bullet.

82
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:04,516
Who would pay a million dollars
to have me killed?

83
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:09,515
Jealous husbands, outraged chefs,
humiliated tailors. The list is endless.

84
00:12:09,765 --> 00:12:12,805
Moreover, this trinket, as you call it,

85
00:12:13,055 --> 00:12:17,471
was sent with a note
requesting "special delivery" to you.

86
00:12:17,721 --> 00:12:21,762
- It's initialled with an S.
- Scaramanga's fingerprints were on it.

87
00:12:22,012 --> 00:12:24,553
They've been verified by the CIA.

88
00:12:24,803 --> 00:12:27,968
- Why would he alert me?
- Psychological.

89
00:12:28,218 --> 00:12:31,259
He counts on his reputation
to terrify his intended victim.

90
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:35,133
Thank you, gentlemen.

91
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:47,714
I'm relieving you
of your present assignment, 007.

92
00:12:49,463 --> 00:12:52,046
- Er, sir?
- Yes?

93
00:12:52,296 --> 00:12:55,545
The energy crisis is still with us.

94
00:12:55,795 --> 00:13:01,169
I submit that finding Gibson and his solar
cell data is more important than ever.

95
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:03,418
It is indeed.

96
00:13:03,668 --> 00:13:10,625
And I can't jeopardise it or any mission
by having Scaramanga put a bullet in you.

97
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:14,249
I'll endorse your request to resign.

98
00:13:14,499 --> 00:13:17,998
Or you can take a sabbatical
and go to ground until this is settled.

99
00:13:18,248 --> 00:13:19,539
Or until he kills me.

100
00:13:19,789 --> 00:13:22,747
Nobody knows where he is
or what he looks like.

101
00:13:22,997 --> 00:13:27,454
So I think it's fair to assume
that he has the edge on you.

102
00:13:27,704 --> 00:13:32,036
Wouldn't you agree? That's all, 007.

103
00:13:39,993 --> 00:13:42,409
If I found him first, sir,

104
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:45,491
that might change the situation.

105
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:50,698
Dramatically, wouldn't you say?

106
00:13:51,073 --> 00:13:54,114
Good day, Bond.

107
00:14:00,863 --> 00:14:02,779
Moneypenny, Fairbanks.

108
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:06,111
- Alaska.
- No. Bill Fairbanks, 002.

109
00:14:06,361 --> 00:14:08,069
Oh, poor Bill.

110
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:10,860
- I miss him.
- The Man with the Golden Gun didn't.

111
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,401
Officially that was never confirmed.

112
00:14:13,651 --> 00:14:15,817
Where was 002 when it happened?

113
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:18,275
Beirut, '69.

114
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:21,024
In a cabaret with a lady called Saida.

115
00:14:21,274 --> 00:14:23,107
Beirut, hm?

116
00:14:23,357 --> 00:14:25,856
Moneypenny,
you are better than a computer.

117
00:14:26,106 --> 00:14:29,189
In all sorts of ways.

118
00:14:29,439 --> 00:14:31,772
But you never take advantage of them.

119
00:14:32,022 --> 00:14:35,854
<i>- Miss Moneypenny.
- Yes, sir.</i>

120
00:14:36,604 --> 00:14:39,187
Oh, just one moment, darling.

121
00:14:39,437 --> 00:14:40,728
Yes, James?

122
00:14:40,978 --> 00:14:43,852
Why wasn't Scaramanga
confirmed as the killer?

123
00:14:44,102 --> 00:14:48,351
Because they couldn't find the bullet!

124
00:14:48,851 --> 00:14:52,267
Darling!

125
00:15:20,885 --> 00:15:22,384
Ahmed.

126
00:15:22,634 --> 00:15:26,050
Ahmed!

127
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:07,415
<i>Entrez.</i>

128
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:13,372
Good evening.
My name is Bond. James Bond.

129
00:16:13,955 --> 00:16:16,496
Your dancing is superb.

130
00:16:16,746 --> 00:16:20,370
<i>- And so are you.
- Merci.</i>

131
00:16:22,745 --> 00:16:25,744
And you are very handsome.

132
00:16:25,994 --> 00:16:32,451
Well, I don't usually intrude like this,
but I... I believe we had a mutual friend.

133
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:35,908
- Bill Fairbanks.
- Fairbanks?

134
00:16:36,158 --> 00:16:37,658
Yes.

135
00:16:37,908 --> 00:16:40,782
I am told you were with him

136
00:16:41,032 --> 00:16:43,823
when he was rather, er...
rudely interrupted.

137
00:16:44,073 --> 00:16:45,989
Ah, "mais oui" - Bill!

138
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:49,155
What a terrible night. I will never forget it.

139
00:16:49,405 --> 00:16:52,404
- Did you see who shot him?
- No, I was in his arms.

140
00:16:52,654 --> 00:16:56,445
- My eyes were closed.
- At least he died happy.

141
00:16:56,695 --> 00:16:59,694
The bullet went through him.

142
00:16:59,944 --> 00:17:04,526
- Through his back and ended up there?
- No, no, through his neck.

143
00:17:04,776 --> 00:17:07,775
I take it out of the wall
before the police arrive.

144
00:17:08,025 --> 00:17:10,775
And now it is my lucky charm.

145
00:17:11,025 --> 00:17:13,732
I never dance without it.

146
00:17:13,982 --> 00:17:17,856
I'm sure Bill would have loved that.

147
00:17:19,398 --> 00:17:22,022
But let us forget the past.

148
00:17:22,272 --> 00:17:25,480
Mm! I was hoping you'd say that.

149
00:17:25,729 --> 00:17:27,646
Are you staying long in Beirut?

150
00:17:27,896 --> 00:17:31,520
Oh, it depends.

151
00:17:48,766 --> 00:17:52,390
Clumsy of me.

152
00:18:00,554 --> 00:18:05,511
You really do have
a magnificent abdomen.

153
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:18,467
Oh, my perfumes! No!

154
00:19:30,616 --> 00:19:33,948
I've lost my charm!

155
00:19:34,198 --> 00:19:37,822
Not from where "I'm" standing.

156
00:19:43,696 --> 00:19:44,987
Taxi? Hotel, mister?

157
00:19:45,237 --> 00:19:49,486
No. To the nearest pharmacy.

158
00:19:51,277 --> 00:19:53,152
Dumdum bullets like this

159
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:56,485
flatten on impact
for maximum wounding effect.

160
00:19:56,734 --> 00:19:59,609
- Very nasty.
- Yes, I'm sure it is.

161
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:02,275
But just tell me
where it was made and by whom.

162
00:20:02,525 --> 00:20:05,357
Well, fortunately it's all in one piece.

163
00:20:05,607 --> 00:20:07,898
20.003 grams.

164
00:20:08,148 --> 00:20:11,523
Which leads us to deduce
it was fired from a 4.2 millimetre gun.

165
00:20:11,772 --> 00:20:14,647
Colthorpe, there's no such thing
as a 4.2 millimetre gun.

166
00:20:14,897 --> 00:20:19,729
The fact that no recognised munitions
manufacturer, military or civil,

167
00:20:19,979 --> 00:20:23,853
produces such a bullet
doesn't mean it doesn't exist, 007.

168
00:20:24,103 --> 00:20:28,185
Q Branch have been making irregular
calibres for most unusual purposes.

169
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:34,017
- And we don't put markings on them.
- Making identification almost impossible.

170
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:38,558
You mean we can't trace it? You've
no idea what it went through to get here.

171
00:20:38,808 --> 00:20:40,932
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.

172
00:20:41,182 --> 00:20:44,515
The workmanship is undemanding
according to our standards.

173
00:20:44,764 --> 00:20:48,888
Soft 23-carat gold with traces of... nickel.

174
00:20:49,138 --> 00:20:51,846
Hardly ever used in Europe.
Comes from India.

175
00:20:52,096 --> 00:20:54,762
Far East?

176
00:20:55,012 --> 00:20:59,511
- Why not India?
- Nickel content obviously too low, 007.

177
00:20:59,761 --> 00:21:03,468
- Lazar?
- Lazar!

178
00:21:03,718 --> 00:21:06,343
Hm. Imaginative.

179
00:21:06,593 --> 00:21:08,509
Highly specialised.

180
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:12,674
Yes, I concur.

181
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,589
- Well, what the hell is Lazar?
- Not what. Who. Portuguese.

182
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:26,004
- Lives in Macau.
- Chap who made the bullet, 007.

183
00:21:50,124 --> 00:21:55,956
I hate to interrupt your dinner,
but does Senhor Lazar live here?

184
00:21:57,247 --> 00:22:00,663
Lazar.

185
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:06,786
I was given this address. Does he...

186
00:22:07,036 --> 00:22:10,660
Senhor Lazar?

187
00:22:10,827 --> 00:22:13,451
My name's Bond. James Bond.

188
00:22:13,701 --> 00:22:16,409
An unexpected honour, Mr Bond.

189
00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:21,116
Your reputation precedes you.
This way, please.

190
00:22:24,948 --> 00:22:29,322
It would be my proudest moment if
I could make something for you, Mr Bond.

191
00:22:29,572 --> 00:22:31,280
A rifle, perhaps.

192
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:35,113
Now, here we have
an interesting problem.

193
00:22:35,363 --> 00:22:38,529
A custom-built model for a client

194
00:22:38,778 --> 00:22:41,694
who recently lost two fingers. Please.

195
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:45,319
- Also lost his trigger.
- It is housed in the butt.

196
00:22:45,568 --> 00:22:49,193
Squeeze it.

197
00:22:58,774 --> 00:23:01,023
The sights are a bit off.

198
00:23:01,273 --> 00:23:05,522
You have five fingers. The butt
is balanced for the pressure of three.

199
00:23:05,772 --> 00:23:09,021
That is why you were one inch too low.

200
00:23:09,271 --> 00:23:13,312
Here you will find only
craftsmanship and quality.

201
00:23:13,562 --> 00:23:15,686
Mass production,

202
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:19,019
your Walther PPK, for instance,
I leave to others.

203
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:20,768
What about ammunition?

204
00:23:21,018 --> 00:23:24,476
Designed to individual requirements,
whatever they may be.

205
00:23:24,726 --> 00:23:27,225
In gold... if I wanted?

206
00:23:27,475 --> 00:23:31,141
- I have already done that for a client.
- I know you have.

207
00:23:31,391 --> 00:23:35,015
Francisco Scaramanga.

208
00:23:35,473 --> 00:23:40,180
My relationship with a client, Mr Bond,
is strictly confidential.

209
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,555
Like a doctor. A priest with a penitent.

210
00:23:42,805 --> 00:23:45,137
Oh, of course!

211
00:23:45,387 --> 00:23:47,887
Yet you make guns
for fingerless hoodlums,

212
00:23:48,137 --> 00:23:49,845
bullets for assassins.

213
00:23:50,094 --> 00:23:54,843
Mr Bond, bullets do not kill.
It is the finger that pulls the trigger.

214
00:23:55,093 --> 00:23:58,509
Exactly!

215
00:23:58,551 --> 00:24:02,883
I'm now aiming precisely at your groin.

216
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:05,632
So speak or for ever hold your peace.

217
00:24:05,882 --> 00:24:07,382
I have never seen him.

218
00:24:07,632 --> 00:24:11,839
On a cost-per-bullet basis,
he must be your best customer.

219
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:15,713
True, but unfortunately
he only fires them occasionally.

220
00:24:15,963 --> 00:24:19,629
When was the, er... last shipment?

221
00:24:19,879 --> 00:24:23,503
This is impossible. I can't...

222
00:24:24,586 --> 00:24:27,002
You're quite right.

223
00:24:27,252 --> 00:24:30,876
An inch too low.

224
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:37,916
I have just completed an order
for immediate delivery.

225
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:40,457
- Who collects them?
- I swear, I do not know.

226
00:24:40,707 --> 00:24:46,289
My instructions are to go to the casino.
I am paid and they vanish.

227
00:25:38,526 --> 00:25:42,401
<i>In a few moments we will be
in Hong Kong harbour,</i>

228
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,650
<i>one of the busiest ports in the world.</i>

229
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,066
<i>May I remind you to have
passports and landing cards ready,</i>

230
00:25:48,316 --> 00:25:52,356
<i>in order to avoid unnecessary delay.</i>

231
00:26:00,355 --> 00:26:03,979
<i>On your left is the wreckage
of the famous liner Queen Elizabeth,</i>

232
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:09,227
<i>which sank here under
mysterious circumstances in 1971.</i>

233
00:26:09,477 --> 00:26:16,142
<i>Ahead, you can now see Kowloon,
and on your right, Hong Kong Island.</i>

234
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:39,803
Taxi!

235
00:26:41,553 --> 00:26:45,177
Follow that Rolls.

236
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,759
Madam, would you be good enough
to move this inverted bedpan?

237
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:56,549
Sorry I'm late, James, but your signal
from Macau just reached the office.

238
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,799
You're a great help, Goodnight.

239
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:04,381
Now, get on to Licence Bureau
and trace that car. AU 603, a green Rolls.

240
00:27:04,631 --> 00:27:06,380
A green Rolls?

241
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,963
A green Rolls-Royce.

242
00:27:09,213 --> 00:27:13,337
There can't be that many in Hong Kong.

243
00:27:15,586 --> 00:27:19,794
Courtesy cars. All green Rolls-Royces
belong to the Peninsula Hotel.

244
00:27:20,044 --> 00:27:24,417
You see what a two-year posting
to Staff Intelligence does for a girl?

245
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:28,000
James, it's wonderful to see you.

246
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:33,124
- Where are you going?
- I need some information.

247
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:42,663
The subject under surveillance
is in room 602.

248
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:46,620
I'll buy you dinner, but first
I have official business to attend to.

249
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:49,495
Yes, I saw the "official business".

250
00:27:49,745 --> 00:27:52,952
Goodnight, would I do that to you
after two years?

251
00:27:53,202 --> 00:27:56,785
Yes, you bloody well would!

252
00:28:00,575 --> 00:28:02,492
- Please.
- I can manage.

253
00:28:02,741 --> 00:28:06,782
You could open a door for me, though.

254
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:13,989
- I open champagne?
- No, it's a surprise.

255
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:17,863
Oh! A surprise!

256
00:29:16,724 --> 00:29:20,348
Good afternoon.

257
00:29:27,638 --> 00:29:31,928
- A water pistol?
- Pass me that robe.

258
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,384
Turn around.

259
00:29:43,884 --> 00:29:48,049
Do you always take a shower
with a pistol?

260
00:29:51,215 --> 00:29:55,089
Put your hands up and get out of here!

261
00:29:59,546 --> 00:30:04,629
- Keep on walking.
- But you haven't answered my question.

262
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:16,584
<i>Reception. Can I help you?</i>

263
00:30:16,834 --> 00:30:19,958
This is Miss Anders. Room 602.

264
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:22,374
Put those down!

265
00:30:22,624 --> 00:30:25,498
I see why these packets carry
a government warning.

266
00:30:25,748 --> 00:30:28,873
Give me that!

267
00:30:29,123 --> 00:30:33,205
They certainly can damage your health.

268
00:30:35,913 --> 00:30:39,412
- Ow! You're hurting my arm.
- Then tell me where those bullets go.

269
00:30:39,662 --> 00:30:42,828
- No, I can't.
- Try!

270
00:30:43,078 --> 00:30:46,743
- He'll kill me!
- Who?

271
00:30:47,785 --> 00:30:50,617
I can't tell you!

272
00:30:50,867 --> 00:30:54,283
Scaramanga.

273
00:30:56,199 --> 00:30:59,990
You see what you can do when you try?

274
00:31:01,365 --> 00:31:04,072
You work for him?

275
00:31:04,322 --> 00:31:07,947
I don't work for him.

276
00:31:08,821 --> 00:31:10,529
He's, um... I'm his...

277
00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:13,570
Oh. So he's a lover too.

278
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,945
Only before he kills.

279
00:31:16,195 --> 00:31:20,069
Bullfighters do the same thing.
Claims it improves the eye.

280
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:23,276
His eye is on me. Where can I find him?

281
00:31:23,526 --> 00:31:25,609
I don't know.

282
00:31:25,859 --> 00:31:27,400
I don't know.

283
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:28,733
I said where?!

284
00:31:28,983 --> 00:31:31,191
I don't know!
He doesn't tell me everything.

285
00:31:31,441 --> 00:31:35,148
I know he has a date
at the Bottoms Up Club tonight.

286
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:37,481
How will I recognise him?

287
00:31:37,731 --> 00:31:40,689
- Tall, slim and dark.
- So is my aunt.

288
00:31:40,939 --> 00:31:44,979
- Anything distinctive about him?
- Yes, but how can I...

289
00:31:45,229 --> 00:31:47,645
He is not like other people. He has three...

290
00:31:47,895 --> 00:31:49,395
Oh.

291
00:31:49,645 --> 00:31:55,018
Fascinating anatomical titbit, but the most
useless piece of information I ever heard.

292
00:31:55,268 --> 00:32:01,559
Unless the Bottoms Up is a strip club
and Scaramanga is performing there.

293
00:32:02,058 --> 00:32:05,266
You'll have to do better.

294
00:32:06,016 --> 00:32:09,682
He usually wears
a white linen suit, black tie,

295
00:32:09,931 --> 00:32:13,056
and jewellery, all gold.

296
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,055
You're improving.

297
00:32:15,305 --> 00:32:19,346
I don't want you to twist my arm again.

298
00:32:19,388 --> 00:32:21,429
I don't want to either.

299
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,303
So I'll tell you what you're going to do.

300
00:32:24,553 --> 00:32:28,052
You're going to take the bullets
to Mr Scaramanga,

301
00:32:28,302 --> 00:32:33,717
because, if he doesn't get them,
he may not show up at the Bottoms Up.

302
00:32:34,009 --> 00:32:36,883
And I want him there.

303
00:32:37,133 --> 00:32:40,299
- Why should you trust me?
- I don't.

304
00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:45,798
But neither will Mr Scaramanga, if he
hears about this interesting conversation.

305
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:51,796
Who knows? He may even use
one of those little golden bullets on you.

306
00:32:52,213 --> 00:32:54,129
And that would be a pity,

307
00:32:54,379 --> 00:32:58,253
because they're "very" expensive.

308
00:32:58,378 --> 00:33:01,169
I'll take them to him.

309
00:33:01,419 --> 00:33:05,043
Let's drink to that.

310
00:33:07,043 --> 00:33:10,667
Bottoms up!

311
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:22,622
- Soda or ginger ale?
- Ginger ale, please.

312
00:35:45,796 --> 00:35:48,170
Police! Drop it!

313
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,545
Drop it!

314
00:35:50,795 --> 00:35:54,419
You're under arrest.

315
00:35:58,959 --> 00:36:02,583
Move away from there!

316
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:09,915
If you take the trouble to examine
that gun, you'll notice it hasn't been fired.

317
00:36:10,165 --> 00:36:15,080
Anything you have to say,
you can say at the station.

318
00:36:20,496 --> 00:36:24,370
I'm charging him under Section 473.

319
00:36:36,367 --> 00:36:40,907
- I didn't see your identity card.
- You will.

320
00:36:56,654 --> 00:36:57,737
Here.

321
00:36:57,987 --> 00:37:03,069
- I thought we were going to the station.
- Kowloon side.

322
00:38:42,836 --> 00:38:45,710
Kowloon's over there!

323
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:50,501
We're going to the New Territories!

324
00:39:32,532 --> 00:39:37,864
<i>Welcome aboard, Commander Bond.</i>

325
00:39:39,697 --> 00:39:43,321
<i>This way, sir.</i>

326
00:39:46,196 --> 00:39:49,820
<i>Down the hatchway, please.</i>

327
00:39:53,861 --> 00:39:56,485
Good evening, sir.

328
00:39:56,735 --> 00:40:00,359
Would you follow me, please?

329
00:40:05,899 --> 00:40:07,857
It certainly gives you a new slant.

330
00:40:08,107 --> 00:40:11,481
What with the Chinese on one side
and the US fleet on the other,

331
00:40:11,731 --> 00:40:15,564
down here's the only place
in Hong Kong you can't be bugged.

332
00:40:15,814 --> 00:40:20,979
And with current real-estate prices
in Hong Kong, quite practical. Any luck?

333
00:40:21,229 --> 00:40:24,853
A Chinese fighter we salvaged.

334
00:40:31,768 --> 00:40:33,809
Good evening, 007.

335
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:37,808
Glad to see you're still with us.

336
00:40:43,598 --> 00:40:47,847
In future, Commander Bond, if you must
tour the world of Suzie Wong by night,

337
00:40:48,097 --> 00:40:51,305
- inform our man here. Lieutenant Hip.
- Sorry, Commander.

338
00:40:51,555 --> 00:40:56,595
I had to get you away from the police,
but didn't know how much you knew.

339
00:40:56,845 --> 00:40:58,137
Nothing.

340
00:40:58,387 --> 00:41:02,969
But I should report, sir, that Scaramanga
does not have a contract on me.

341
00:41:03,219 --> 00:41:07,343
He couldn't have missed me tonight.
Instead he hit a chap at a club.

342
00:41:07,593 --> 00:41:12,800
- I got a shock when I saw who it was.
- I should think you did.

343
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:16,132
Our missing solar-energy expert: Gibson.

344
00:41:16,382 --> 00:41:21,006
Yes. Gibson. He was prepared
to come back under certain conditions.

345
00:41:21,256 --> 00:41:23,630
That's why I'm here
with Professor Frazier.

346
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,463
Lieutenant Hip
was making a preliminary contact.

347
00:41:27,713 --> 00:41:33,170
I almost wish that Scaramanga
had a contract on you.

348
00:41:33,253 --> 00:41:34,919
Was Gibson cooperative?

349
00:41:35,169 --> 00:41:39,668
He wanted to bargain for immunity.
Suggested another meeting in Bangkok.

350
00:41:39,918 --> 00:41:43,417
- Why Bangkok?
- I think he worked there for Hai Fat.

351
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,167
That name's come up before.

352
00:41:45,417 --> 00:41:48,333
A multimillionaire.
Head of Hai Fat Enterprises.

353
00:41:48,583 --> 00:41:50,541
All legitimate, as far as we know.

354
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:53,456
What did Gibson
propose bargaining with?

355
00:41:53,706 --> 00:41:56,706
A solex. Claimed it was 95% efficient.

356
00:41:56,956 --> 00:42:00,955
If he developed a solar cell that efficient,
he solved the energy crisis.

357
00:42:01,205 --> 00:42:02,913
So you've told me.

358
00:42:03,162 --> 00:42:06,578
Coal and oil will soon be depleted.
Uranium's too dangerous.

359
00:42:06,828 --> 00:42:10,452
Geothermal and tidal control
too expensive. I know all that.

360
00:42:10,702 --> 00:42:13,993
- Where's the solex now?
- Solex "agitator", sir.

361
00:42:14,243 --> 00:42:18,159
"The" essential unit to convert
radiation from the sun into electricity

362
00:42:18,409 --> 00:42:21,116
on an industrial basis. It's only that size.

363
00:42:21,366 --> 00:42:25,532
It won't take long to check out Gibson's
efficiency claim. This is exciting!

364
00:42:25,782 --> 00:42:28,615
May I see it, Lieutenant?

365
00:42:28,865 --> 00:42:32,947
He showed it to me at the bar
and replaced it in his pocket.

366
00:42:33,197 --> 00:42:35,946
And after he was shot,

367
00:42:36,196 --> 00:42:38,695
it wasn't there.

368
00:42:38,945 --> 00:42:41,736
I looked.

369
00:42:41,986 --> 00:42:44,152
Gentlemen, I congratulate you.

370
00:42:44,402 --> 00:42:47,027
Instead of getting a perfected solex,

371
00:42:47,277 --> 00:42:50,484
we're left with a useless corpse
and no leads.

372
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:53,234
One lead, sir.

373
00:42:53,484 --> 00:42:56,649
Assuming Gibson
was killed by Scaramanga,

374
00:42:56,899 --> 00:42:59,899
whoever hired him
could afford a million dollars.

375
00:43:00,149 --> 00:43:03,439
- Are you suggesting Hai Fat?
- He could afford it.

376
00:43:03,689 --> 00:43:05,772
Out of petty cash.

377
00:43:06,022 --> 00:43:08,147
A thought has occurred to me.

378
00:43:08,397 --> 00:43:11,229
If Hai Fat hired Scaramanga,

379
00:43:11,479 --> 00:43:14,728
- it's unlikely that he met him personally.
- Why?

380
00:43:14,978 --> 00:43:18,602
If anything had gone wrong,
there's nothing to connect the two.

381
00:43:18,852 --> 00:43:21,727
That gives me an idea
as to how to approach him.

382
00:43:21,977 --> 00:43:26,684
Q, I'll... need this.

383
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:32,224
- Really, 007!
- Oh, I admit it's a little kinky.

384
00:43:32,474 --> 00:43:36,098
You'll take Miss Goodnight with you.

385
00:43:36,348 --> 00:43:39,097
- Goodnight, sir?
- After tonight's debacle,

386
00:43:39,347 --> 00:43:44,555
an efficient liaison officer
wouldn't come amiss.

387
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:46,596
Thank you, sir.

388
00:43:46,846 --> 00:43:48,554
You won't get near Hai Fat.

389
00:43:48,803 --> 00:43:51,844
I have relatives in Bangkok.
I have often passed his place.

390
00:43:52,094 --> 00:43:56,718
He lives in a house on a mountain
surrounded by guards.

391
00:44:39,541 --> 00:44:42,582
No way!
The place is crawling with guards.

392
00:44:42,832 --> 00:44:46,456
Have a look.

393
00:44:50,872 --> 00:44:53,371
Hai Fat takes his privacy very seriously.

394
00:44:53,621 --> 00:44:57,037
I'm sure he'll see me.

395
00:45:19,823 --> 00:45:22,614
Good morning. How's the water?

396
00:45:22,864 --> 00:45:24,780
Why don't you come in and find out?

397
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:28,738
- Sounds very tempting, Miss, er...
- Chew Mee.

398
00:45:28,987 --> 00:45:30,945
Really?

399
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:34,444
There's only one problem.
I have no swimming trunks.

400
00:45:34,694 --> 00:45:37,569
Neither have I.

401
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:41,235
What are you doing here?

402
00:45:42,734 --> 00:45:46,275
Get out!

403
00:45:46,525 --> 00:45:47,816
Immediately.

404
00:45:48,066 --> 00:45:51,357
I will have you...

405
00:45:59,105 --> 00:46:03,354
Please forgive me, Mr Scaramanga.

406
00:46:04,979 --> 00:46:07,436
Excuse me, Chew Mee.

407
00:46:07,686 --> 00:46:11,102
Bye-ee.

408
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:14,476
You understand my surprise.

409
00:46:14,726 --> 00:46:18,350
I thought it was understood.

410
00:46:18,767 --> 00:46:21,766
We were never to meet, Mr Scaramanga.

411
00:46:22,016 --> 00:46:24,349
I always thought
your abnormality was a myth.

412
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:29,098
Some cults consider it a sign of
invulnerability and great sexual prowess.

413
00:46:29,348 --> 00:46:31,972
I've learned to live with it.

414
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:34,138
Why are you here?

415
00:46:34,388 --> 00:46:36,096
Bond. James Bond.

416
00:46:36,346 --> 00:46:39,554
- Do I know the gentleman?
- Well, he knows you.

417
00:46:39,804 --> 00:46:44,011
Without being immodest, there are few
people in this part of the world who don't.

418
00:46:44,261 --> 00:46:47,343
And there are very few people
who haven't heard of Bond.

419
00:46:47,593 --> 00:46:51,051
British Secret Service,
007, licensed to kill.

420
00:46:51,301 --> 00:46:54,133
He's good, even by my standards.

421
00:46:54,383 --> 00:46:57,674
- He was near the Bottoms Up Club.
- A coincidence.

422
00:46:57,924 --> 00:46:59,965
I don't believe in them.

423
00:47:00,215 --> 00:47:02,590
The man's a menace.
He knows something.

424
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:06,589
Are you suggesting I invest
another million to remove him?

425
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:08,630
That's up to you.

426
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,963
I will give it some thought.

427
00:47:11,213 --> 00:47:15,962
Since you have chosen to meet me,
perhaps you will dine here tonight.

428
00:47:16,211 --> 00:47:19,086
- I'll be delighted.
- Nine o'clock, then.

429
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:24,751
Ling Po, see this gentleman out.

430
00:47:36,457 --> 00:47:38,414
Don't tell me you saw him?!

431
00:47:38,664 --> 00:47:40,830
He even invited me to dinner.

432
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:45,246
He must have found me quite titillating.

433
00:48:01,784 --> 00:48:06,991
In due time, I shall be laid to rest
here in my mausoleum

434
00:48:07,241 --> 00:48:10,032
after a useful, happy, long life.

435
00:48:10,282 --> 00:48:15,947
And I do not intend
to allow Mr Bond to shorten it.

436
00:48:22,112 --> 00:48:24,028
I'll get the car.

437
00:48:24,278 --> 00:48:28,985
- You know I'd rather be dining with you.
- I understand, James. Please hurry back.

438
00:48:29,235 --> 00:48:32,610
I'll ring as soon as I do.
A midnight snack might be just the thing.

439
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:35,484
I'll keep the wine properly chilled.

440
00:48:35,734 --> 00:48:39,525
And everything else warm, I trust.

441
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:47,564
Bye-bye!

442
00:48:47,814 --> 00:48:51,438
And everything else warm?!

443
00:48:52,313 --> 00:48:55,437
I hope you don't mind
giving my nieces a lift.

444
00:48:55,687 --> 00:48:58,853
Good evening.

445
00:49:04,685 --> 00:49:08,309
Hai Fat's is on the way.

446
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:17,474
I'll drop the girls, come back and wait.

447
00:49:17,849 --> 00:49:21,473
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

448
00:49:30,429 --> 00:49:35,011
The name's Scaramanga.
Mr Fat is expecting me.

449
00:49:55,881 --> 00:49:59,505
Grislyland.

450
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:25,957
A pleasant evening.

451
00:51:12,821 --> 00:51:16,445
Get him! Come on!

452
00:51:25,443 --> 00:51:29,067
Stop it!

453
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:32,358
Not here.

454
00:51:32,899 --> 00:51:35,648
This is my home.

455
00:51:35,898 --> 00:51:39,647
Take Mr Bond to school.

456
00:51:53,103 --> 00:51:56,518
Heaven.

457
00:51:57,685 --> 00:52:02,017
Definitely heaven.

458
00:53:56,906 --> 00:54:00,655
Tashman.

459
00:55:22,677 --> 00:55:26,093
Chula.

460
00:55:27,134 --> 00:55:32,133
Chula! Chula! Chula!

461
00:55:52,586 --> 00:55:57,043
Chula! Chula! Chula!

462
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,531
Are you all right?

463
00:56:46,781 --> 00:56:51,280
- How did you find me?
- Hai Fat owns this place.

464
00:56:58,029 --> 00:57:01,444
Stand back, girls.

465
00:57:14,275 --> 00:57:16,191
Forgot to tell you!

466
00:57:16,441 --> 00:57:21,106
Their father runs a karate school.

467
00:58:19,259 --> 00:58:22,258
Hang on!

468
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:51,918
What you might call
a Mexican screw-up, gentlemen!

469
00:59:27,742 --> 00:59:29,867
Pretty lady, 100 bahts.

470
00:59:30,117 --> 00:59:31,908
- No, no.
- 80 bahts.

471
00:59:32,158 --> 00:59:33,241
50 bahts.

472
00:59:33,491 --> 00:59:37,531
Pretty lady, real elephant. 60 bahts.

473
00:59:37,781 --> 00:59:41,406
Missy, yesa!

474
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:55,402
Elephant. Bargain, mister. 100 bahts.

475
01:00:00,609 --> 01:00:03,192
Elephant! Real elephant.

476
01:00:03,442 --> 01:00:06,358
50 bahts.

477
01:00:09,107 --> 01:00:12,356
You are very handsome man. 40 bahts.

478
01:00:12,606 --> 01:00:14,689
For you, mister, 20 bahts.

479
01:00:14,939 --> 01:00:20,771
Sonny, I'll give you 20,000 bahts
if you can make this heap go any faster.

480
01:00:21,021 --> 01:00:24,312
20,000 bahts!

481
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:32,310
- I'm afraid I'll have to owe you.
- Bloody tourist! 20,000 bahts!

482
01:00:47,973 --> 01:00:51,222
Goddamn little brown water hog!

483
01:00:51,472 --> 01:00:53,721
Oh, what's the matter, JW, huh?

484
01:00:53,971 --> 01:01:00,511
You just try that in "my" bayou, boy!
I'd haul your ass!

485
01:01:18,507 --> 01:01:23,672
Oh, look, JW. I just gotta have me
one of those cute little elephants.

486
01:01:23,922 --> 01:01:25,755
Elephants!

487
01:01:26,005 --> 01:01:29,629
We're Democrats, Maybelle.

488
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:36,461
If you got your little pointy heads
out of them pajamas,

489
01:01:36,711 --> 01:01:40,335
you wouldn't be late for work.

490
01:02:08,037 --> 01:02:10,036
I knew it!

491
01:02:10,286 --> 01:02:18,117
You pointy-heads has no more idea
of traffic control than a gooney bird!

492
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:30,489
Get your cotton-picking schnoz
out of my pants. Hear now?

493
01:02:49,485 --> 01:02:54,317
Boy, you is ugly.

494
01:02:56,566 --> 01:02:59,149
JW?

495
01:02:59,399 --> 01:03:02,815
Where are you?

496
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:35,640
What do they teach in that school?
Ballet dancing?

497
01:03:36,848 --> 01:03:41,181
I find nothing remotely amusing
about Mr Bond's escape.

498
01:03:41,431 --> 01:03:42,930
You underestimated him.

499
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:47,179
Even my influence doesn't extend
into the British Secret Service.

500
01:03:47,429 --> 01:03:49,179
I shall lie low too.

501
01:03:49,429 --> 01:03:53,136
I won't jeopardise a project
in which I've invested half my fortune,

502
01:03:53,386 --> 01:03:55,302
when it's ready to yield billions.

503
01:03:55,552 --> 01:03:59,551
- Where will you hide out?
- That does not concern you.

504
01:03:59,801 --> 01:04:02,259
Take this.

505
01:04:02,509 --> 01:04:07,424
Return it to the plant and
don't leave there without my permission.

506
01:04:07,674 --> 01:04:09,799
May I remind you that you work for me.

507
01:04:10,049 --> 01:04:14,631
I took you on as a junior partner to be an
occasional convenience. Nothing more.

508
01:04:14,881 --> 01:04:18,422
I did not hire you to interfere in my affairs.

509
01:04:18,672 --> 01:04:23,795
- Is that clearly understood?
- Oh, yes, very clearly.

510
01:04:24,503 --> 01:04:28,544
I now regret having even considered
employing your services,

511
01:04:28,794 --> 01:04:30,794
but that is beside the point.

512
01:04:31,044 --> 01:04:35,584
Bond doesn't know you're in Bangkok.
He's never seen you, but he knows me.

513
01:04:35,834 --> 01:04:37,917
That's the problem.

514
01:04:38,167 --> 01:04:41,791
That's no problem.

515
01:04:59,912 --> 01:05:02,994
What happened?

516
01:05:03,244 --> 01:05:05,535
Mr Fat has just resigned.

517
01:05:05,785 --> 01:05:09,576
I'm the new chairman of the board.

518
01:05:09,826 --> 01:05:12,242
He always did like that mausoleum.

519
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:16,074
Put him in it.

520
01:05:32,737 --> 01:05:35,153
Sorry about that, darling. It was Hip.

521
01:05:35,403 --> 01:05:39,985
Still no sign of Hai Fat. Every inquiry
gets a polite Oriental brushoff.

522
01:05:40,235 --> 01:05:42,776
With the compliments.

523
01:05:43,026 --> 01:05:45,484
"Phuyuck"?

524
01:05:45,734 --> 01:05:49,358
'74, sir.

525
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:56,356
- I approve.
- You do?

526
01:05:56,606 --> 01:06:00,105
Oh, not the wine. Your frock.

527
01:06:00,355 --> 01:06:03,854
Tight in all the right places.
Not too many buttons.

528
01:06:04,104 --> 01:06:06,812
Standard uniform for Southeast Asia.

529
01:06:07,062 --> 01:06:09,770
The buttons are down the back.

530
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:14,019
Designed by Q, no doubt.
One of them's a suicide pill, I suppose.

531
01:06:14,268 --> 01:06:18,434
No. But the bottom one has a homer in it.

532
01:06:18,684 --> 01:06:20,642
How original.

533
01:06:20,892 --> 01:06:27,265
<i>A toast.
Per ora e per il momento che verrá.</i>

534
01:06:27,515 --> 01:06:29,806
"To this moment,

535
01:06:30,056 --> 01:06:33,680
and the moment yet to come. "

536
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:42,262
In our profession, I'm afraid, you never
can count on that moment to come.

537
01:06:42,512 --> 01:06:46,469
Who knows where you and I will be
this time next year?

538
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:49,885
Opposite sides of the world, most likely.

539
01:06:50,135 --> 01:06:52,634
That's too far apart.

540
01:06:52,884 --> 01:06:56,092
Now, if Hip doesn't come up with a lead,

541
01:06:56,342 --> 01:07:01,007
there's really nothing very much
for us to do tonight.

542
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:06,672
Or is there?

543
01:07:06,922 --> 01:07:10,172
Oh, darling, I'm tempted.

544
01:07:10,422 --> 01:07:13,754
But killing a few hours
as one of your passing fancies

545
01:07:14,004 --> 01:07:17,628
isn't quite my scene.

546
01:07:55,036 --> 01:07:58,660
Phuyuck!

547
01:08:09,907 --> 01:08:12,865
Ah! Goodnight. What a pleasant surprise.

548
01:08:13,115 --> 01:08:16,947
My hard-to-get act
didn't last very long, did it?

549
01:08:17,197 --> 01:08:21,154
I was trained
to expect the unexpected, but...

550
01:08:21,404 --> 01:08:26,820
they never prepared me
for anything like you in a nightie.

551
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:45,940
James, I thought
this would never happen.

552
01:08:51,730 --> 01:08:56,437
- What made you change your mind?
- I'm weak.

553
01:08:57,562 --> 01:09:01,186
Don't move!

554
01:09:16,308 --> 01:09:21,015
Miss Anders! I didn't recognise you
with your clothes on.

555
01:09:21,265 --> 01:09:23,514
I bribed a bellboy to let me in.

556
01:09:23,764 --> 01:09:25,680
I've come to warn you,

557
01:09:25,930 --> 01:09:27,846
you're in great danger.

558
01:09:28,096 --> 01:09:33,345
I usually am. That's why I use
the old three-pillow trick.

559
01:09:33,595 --> 01:09:36,969
Please believe me.
I'm risking my life to come here.

560
01:09:37,219 --> 01:09:40,552
Well, your concern for my wellbeing
is touching,

561
01:09:40,802 --> 01:09:42,885
but puzzles me.

562
01:09:43,134 --> 01:09:46,842
- Scaramanga is in Bangkok.
- He was in Hong Kong, but not after me.

563
01:09:47,092 --> 01:09:50,799
We've been through that routine.

564
01:09:52,007 --> 01:09:54,298
He's a monster. I hate him.

565
01:09:54,548 --> 01:09:56,881
Then leave him.

566
01:09:57,131 --> 01:10:00,214
You don't walk out on Scaramanga.

567
01:10:00,464 --> 01:10:05,796
- There's no place he wouldn't find me.
- You need a good lawyer.

568
01:10:05,796 --> 01:10:07,920
I need 007.

569
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:12,711
Who do you think sent that bullet
to London with your number on it?

570
01:10:12,961 --> 01:10:16,585
I did.

571
01:10:17,501 --> 01:10:22,875
And it wasn't easy
getting his fingerprint on the note.

572
01:10:23,916 --> 01:10:26,957
Forgive me
if I've been slow on the uptake.

573
01:10:27,207 --> 01:10:31,331
Don't you see you're the only man
in the world who can kill him?

574
01:10:31,581 --> 01:10:34,289
Now, what gives you that idea?

575
01:10:34,539 --> 01:10:37,455
The way Scaramanga speaks about you.

576
01:10:37,705 --> 01:10:42,453
- Even has a likeness of you.
- I'm flattered.

577
01:10:43,745 --> 01:10:47,577
I want him dead.

578
01:10:48,452 --> 01:10:52,534
Name your price. Anything, I'll pay it.

579
01:10:54,825 --> 01:10:58,450
You can have me too, if you like.

580
01:10:58,450 --> 01:11:00,699
I'm not unattractive.

581
01:11:00,949 --> 01:11:05,739
At last you're starting to tell the truth.

582
01:11:08,489 --> 01:11:12,571
I've dreamed about you setting me free.

583
01:11:16,695 --> 01:11:22,985
I've been dreaming about a solex agitator.

584
01:11:27,068 --> 01:11:30,692
Ever heard of one?

585
01:11:32,983 --> 01:11:36,607
Perhaps you can have that too.

586
01:11:50,604 --> 01:11:54,769
- No, my clothes are in there.
- Get in.

587
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:58,643
- I'll kill that woman.
- Later!

588
01:12:16,097 --> 01:12:19,721
Charming.

589
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:40,716
It was an inspiration, sending that bullet.

590
01:13:21,331 --> 01:13:23,498
You're late.

591
01:13:23,748 --> 01:13:27,372
It was a double feature.

592
01:13:28,871 --> 01:13:31,287
What are you doing?

593
01:13:31,537 --> 01:13:35,328
Putting my jewellery away.

594
01:13:49,866 --> 01:13:51,782
You can come out now.

595
01:13:52,032 --> 01:13:54,698
- What time is it?
- Two-ish.

596
01:13:54,948 --> 01:13:58,364
Two? You mean
I've been in here for two hours?

597
01:13:58,614 --> 01:14:00,864
All in the line of duty.

598
01:14:01,113 --> 01:14:03,904
Duty! I'm resigning in the morning!

599
01:14:04,154 --> 01:14:07,529
Goodnight, don't let us down.
The Service needs women like you.

600
01:14:07,779 --> 01:14:11,611
Well, obviously you don't!

601
01:14:12,319 --> 01:14:14,277
Forgive me, darling.

602
01:14:14,527 --> 01:14:16,651
Your turn will come, I promise.

603
01:14:16,901 --> 01:14:18,942
As soon as she brings me that solex.

604
01:14:19,192 --> 01:14:24,233
- For killing Scaramanga?
- If she gets me the solex agitator first.

605
01:14:24,483 --> 01:14:26,357
First?

606
01:14:26,607 --> 01:14:30,856
James, you must be good.

607
01:14:31,981 --> 01:14:37,980
Oh. We'll find out about that
the next time I meet her.

608
01:14:38,604 --> 01:14:42,229
She's making the arrangements.

609
01:15:21,344 --> 01:15:24,843
Sorry I'm late.
Bangkok traffic's worse than Piccadilly.

610
01:15:25,093 --> 01:15:27,343
He's made contact.

611
01:15:27,592 --> 01:15:31,175
- How's the charm boy doing?
- Need you ask?

612
01:15:31,425 --> 01:15:34,674
Meet you outside.

613
01:15:36,799 --> 01:15:40,423
Did you bring it?

614
01:16:07,749 --> 01:16:09,832
Darling, I left it in your handbag.

615
01:16:10,082 --> 01:16:13,915
It must be in here somewhere, dear.
I saw the man in the shop give it to you.

616
01:16:14,165 --> 01:16:16,789
Without the ticket, we can't get a receipt.

617
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:20,246
You won't find it in there, Mr Bond.
I looked before you came.

618
01:16:20,496 --> 01:16:24,829
I wouldn't do that either. Look behind you.

619
01:16:25,037 --> 01:16:28,244
Lower.

620
01:16:29,286 --> 01:16:34,701
A gun in a bag of peanuts. How original.
What will they think of next?

621
01:16:36,201 --> 01:16:39,575
My name is Scaramanga.
Francisco Scaramanga.

622
01:16:39,825 --> 01:16:43,782
I feel I know you, although
I never thought we should ever meet.

623
01:16:44,032 --> 01:16:48,156
It's a very great pleasure for me, Mr Bond,
thanks to Miss Anders.

624
01:16:48,406 --> 01:16:50,906
You've a strange way
of showing gratitude.

625
01:16:51,156 --> 01:16:54,530
A mistress cannot serve two masters.

626
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:57,821
A difficult shot, but most gratifying.

627
01:16:58,071 --> 01:17:01,570
Well, we, er... all get our jollies
one way or another.

628
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:04,527
Mine have always been guns, Mr Bond.

629
01:17:04,777 --> 01:17:07,818
When I was a boy
I was brought up in a circus.

630
01:17:08,068 --> 01:17:12,984
My only real friend
was a magnificent African bull elephant.

631
01:17:13,234 --> 01:17:18,274
One day his handler mistreated him
and he went berserk.

632
01:17:18,607 --> 01:17:21,815
Bleeding, dying,

633
01:17:22,065 --> 01:17:25,689
he came and found me.

634
01:17:25,772 --> 01:17:32,854
Stood on one leg - his best trick -
picked me up and put me on his back.

635
01:17:34,728 --> 01:17:38,602
The man emptied the gun into his eye.

636
01:17:39,144 --> 01:17:45,809
- I emptied my stage pistol into his.
- An eye for an eye. Nut?

637
01:17:49,683 --> 01:17:52,891
You see, Mr Bond,
I always thought I liked animals.

638
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:58,098
Then I discovered that
I liked killing people even more.

639
01:18:04,304 --> 01:18:08,553
Keep this. Whatever you do, don't lose it.

640
01:18:08,553 --> 01:18:11,094
- I have to help James.
- Something's wrong?

641
01:18:11,344 --> 01:18:14,219
- There's a midget with a gun on him.
- A midget?

642
01:18:14,469 --> 01:18:19,551
Same one I saw at the Bottoms Up.
The girl is dead. Call the police!

643
01:18:25,716 --> 01:18:27,965
Forget the girl. She's replaceable.

644
01:18:28,215 --> 01:18:30,465
And I shall find what she stole from me.

645
01:18:30,715 --> 01:18:35,255
Personally, I have nothing against you,
so let's hope our paths never cross again.

646
01:18:35,505 --> 01:18:37,421
Please don't try to follow me.

647
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:40,629
Your peanut-toting friend back there
wouldn't like it.

648
01:18:40,879 --> 01:18:44,503
No, he wouldn't.

649
01:18:54,334 --> 01:18:57,958
You want to try one of mine?

650
01:19:06,873 --> 01:19:08,997
- Where's the solex?
- With Goodnight.

651
01:19:09,247 --> 01:19:12,580
- Where's Goodnight?
- Outside.

652
01:19:46,363 --> 01:19:49,987
She must be by the car.

653
01:20:16,981 --> 01:20:20,605
Women! Walkie-talkie.

654
01:20:23,229 --> 01:20:26,687
- Goodnight, where are you?
- Somebody locked me in a boot.

655
01:20:26,936 --> 01:20:32,102
<i>- In a what?!
- The midget's car. I'm locked in.</i>

656
01:20:32,352 --> 01:20:38,600
<i>It's a bronze car with a black roof.
Number 7543.</i>

657
01:20:42,599 --> 01:20:44,724
- The keys!
- I haven't got them.

658
01:20:44,974 --> 01:20:47,098
Oh, no.

659
01:20:47,348 --> 01:20:50,972
<i>- Goodnight, where are the car keys?
- Oh, I've got the keys.</i>

660
01:20:51,222 --> 01:20:55,346
And I've got the solex too.

661
01:20:56,179 --> 01:20:57,471
Taxi!

662
01:20:57,721 --> 01:21:02,428
Stay in there, Goodnight.
We've got you spotted.

663
01:21:09,093 --> 01:21:12,717
Taxi! Taxi!

664
01:21:13,259 --> 01:21:16,674
Taxi!

665
01:21:25,589 --> 01:21:30,463
- How 'bout a demonstration, boy?
- Certainly, sir.

666
01:21:37,211 --> 01:21:41,710
What the hell is goin' on?!

667
01:21:45,792 --> 01:21:49,208
Now... I know you!

668
01:21:49,458 --> 01:21:50,749
Oh, no.

669
01:21:50,999 --> 01:21:57,040
You're that secret agent.
That English secret agent from England.

670
01:22:06,537 --> 01:22:08,870
You're chasin' somebody.

671
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,744
Who are you after this time, boy?
Commies?

672
01:22:11,994 --> 01:22:16,452
Let's go get 'em! I'm with you all the way.

673
01:22:22,825 --> 01:22:26,949
Uh-oh. I think we've got trouble.

674
01:22:44,112 --> 01:22:48,152
Pull your cars over,
you little brown pointy-heads!

675
01:22:48,402 --> 01:22:51,318
I'm a peace officer!

676
01:22:51,568 --> 01:22:54,067
<i>James? Are you still there?</i>

677
01:22:54,317 --> 01:22:56,067
<i>James!</i>

678
01:22:56,317 --> 01:22:58,483
Can you hear me? James!

679
01:22:58,733 --> 01:23:00,649
All right, Goodnight. Don't panic.

680
01:23:00,899 --> 01:23:03,940
- Who's that?
- It's, er...

681
01:23:04,190 --> 01:23:06,606
- It's Headquarters.
- Let me talk to 'em.

682
01:23:06,856 --> 01:23:08,980
Hello. This is Sheriff JW Pepper,

683
01:23:09,230 --> 01:23:10,730
<i>Louisiana State Police.</i>

684
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:16,395
<i>You call my wife at the Narai Hotel
and tell her I'm on a mission.</i>

685
01:23:16,645 --> 01:23:19,103
I've been deputised. Right?

686
01:23:19,353 --> 01:23:20,853
Right.

687
01:23:21,103 --> 01:23:24,727
Which car are we all chasin', boy?

688
01:24:34,501 --> 01:24:37,251
Move it! Move it!

689
01:24:37,501 --> 01:24:41,250
Get that piece of junk off of the road.

690
01:25:08,410 --> 01:25:11,742
They went left, boy.

691
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:23,073
Press that pedal, boy.

692
01:25:36,486 --> 01:25:40,110
Where the hell have they got to?

693
01:25:52,774 --> 01:25:56,107
You goofed, boy.

694
01:26:06,729 --> 01:26:11,186
Nearest bridge is two miles back.

695
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:21,267
Goddamn! What the...

696
01:26:21,517 --> 01:26:26,682
What's goin' on?
What the hell are you doin' now, boy?

697
01:26:27,224 --> 01:26:30,848
The bridge is "that" way!

698
01:26:33,473 --> 01:26:35,180
You're not thinking of...?

699
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:38,596
I sure am, boy!

700
01:26:38,846 --> 01:26:42,679
Ever heard of Evel Knievel?

701
01:26:50,843 --> 01:26:55,259
Wowee!

702
01:26:56,050 --> 01:26:58,216
I ain't never done that before!

703
01:26:58,466 --> 01:27:02,299
Neither have I, actually.

704
01:27:56,994 --> 01:28:01,285
Let's go get 'em, boy!

705
01:28:35,818 --> 01:28:37,734
You stay put, boy.

706
01:28:37,984 --> 01:28:41,400
This is "my" department.

707
01:28:42,275 --> 01:28:44,732
Glad to see you boys on the ball!

708
01:28:44,982 --> 01:28:48,106
Sheriff JW Pepper, Louisiana State Police.

709
01:28:48,356 --> 01:28:50,148
Here's my identification.

710
01:28:50,398 --> 01:28:53,189
Law Enforcement Association,
American Legion.

711
01:28:53,439 --> 01:28:56,604
Me and my partner here,
we're on a secret mission.

712
01:28:56,854 --> 01:29:01,270
What the hell you doing?
Give me my wallet back.

713
01:29:20,182 --> 01:29:23,598
Doors.

714
01:29:52,383 --> 01:29:55,340
You can't do this to me.
I want my wallet back.

715
01:29:55,590 --> 01:29:57,631
Take these goddamn bracelets off!

716
01:29:57,881 --> 01:30:02,005
I'm gonna sue ya for false arrest!
Police brutality. I got connections.

717
01:30:02,255 --> 01:30:05,504
I'm gonna get the FBI on your ass!
The CIA!

718
01:30:05,754 --> 01:30:09,253
Goddamn it,
I'm gonna get Henry Kissinger!

719
01:30:09,503 --> 01:30:14,377
Now look at me
when I'm talkin' to ya, boy.

720
01:30:18,876 --> 01:30:24,083
What's the matter?
Ain't none of you seen a plane before?

721
01:30:25,791 --> 01:30:29,290
<i>James? James, are you still there?</i>

722
01:30:29,540 --> 01:30:31,456
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

723
01:30:31,706 --> 01:30:35,330
<i>I think we've stopped.</i>

724
01:30:54,201 --> 01:30:58,200
That is really
all there is to report, sir.

725
01:30:58,450 --> 01:31:01,324
So, if I heard correctly,
Scaramanga got away.

726
01:31:01,574 --> 01:31:02,865
Yes, sir.

727
01:31:03,115 --> 01:31:06,739
- In a car that sprouted wings.
- That's perfectly feasible, sir.

728
01:31:06,989 --> 01:31:10,655
- In fact, we're working on one now.
- Oh, Q! Shut up.

729
01:31:10,905 --> 01:31:13,238
- Miss Goodnight was in the boot?
- Yes, sir.

730
01:31:13,488 --> 01:31:17,404
We found the car-plane abandoned
about 200 miles west of Bangkok.

731
01:31:17,654 --> 01:31:20,903
- And the solex?
- In Goodnight's handbag, sir.

732
01:31:21,153 --> 01:31:23,610
- Where's Goodnight now?
- We don't know, sir.

733
01:31:23,860 --> 01:31:27,984
Communications aren't getting the signal
from the homer she has supplied by Q.

734
01:31:28,234 --> 01:31:32,233
Rubbish! They're simply
not stepping up the reception to enable...

735
01:31:32,483 --> 01:31:34,399
Oh, shut up, Q!

736
01:31:34,649 --> 01:31:38,523
Of all the fouled-up,
half-witted operations!

737
01:31:38,773 --> 01:31:42,106
- What do you want?
- We've picked up Goodnight's signal, sir.

738
01:31:42,356 --> 01:31:47,813
- Well, that's something.
- But there's something rather curious, sir.

739
01:31:48,063 --> 01:31:49,771
Our sector's here,

740
01:31:50,021 --> 01:31:54,811
and we're receiving her signal
from somewhere off this coastline here.

741
01:31:55,061 --> 01:31:58,227
Now here it is on a much larger scale.

742
01:31:58,477 --> 01:32:01,809
That's where she is.
In this group of small islands.

743
01:32:02,059 --> 01:32:04,684
That's all we need! Red Chinese waters.

744
01:32:04,934 --> 01:32:07,933
We could stray
inadvertently into them, sir.

745
01:32:08,183 --> 01:32:12,640
- I could fly low under their radar screen.
- Absolutely out of the question.

746
01:32:12,890 --> 01:32:16,972
If the PM gets to hear of this,
he'll hang me from the yardarm.

747
01:32:17,222 --> 01:32:22,638
Officially you won't know
a thing about it, sir.

748
01:33:38,203 --> 01:33:41,119
There's a small seaplane
approaching your island.

749
01:33:41,369 --> 01:33:43,285
Do you want us to take action?

750
01:33:43,535 --> 01:33:48,200
No. No, please don't do anything.

751
01:33:48,783 --> 01:33:50,283
Yes, it's a...

752
01:33:50,533 --> 01:33:54,157
guest I'm expecting.

753
01:33:54,865 --> 01:33:58,073
No, he won't be leaving.

754
01:35:15,971 --> 01:35:18,387
<i>Bonjour, Monsieur Bond.</i>

755
01:35:18,637 --> 01:35:21,636
I am Nick Nack.

756
01:35:23,885 --> 01:35:25,968
<i>Dom Pérignon soixante-quatre.</i>

757
01:35:26,218 --> 01:35:28,426
I prefer the '62 myself.

758
01:35:28,676 --> 01:35:30,592
Still, beats a bag of peanuts.

759
01:35:30,842 --> 01:35:36,007
Monsieur Scaramanga
will welcome you personally.

760
01:35:39,340 --> 01:35:44,214
Forgive me, Mr Bond.
A vulgar display, but I couldn't resist it

761
01:35:44,464 --> 01:35:47,838
because I am so delighted
to see you again.

762
01:35:48,088 --> 01:35:51,004
A harmless toy.

763
01:35:51,254 --> 01:35:55,003
I am, as you can see now,
completely unarmed.

764
01:35:55,253 --> 01:35:56,961
Cigarette?

765
01:35:57,211 --> 01:36:00,002
We have so much in common
and so much to discuss.

766
01:36:00,252 --> 01:36:02,376
We will never have this chance again.

767
01:36:02,626 --> 01:36:07,500
Ours is the loneliest profession, so let us
spend a few pleasant hours together.

768
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:10,374
How can I refuse
such a gracious invitation?

769
01:36:10,624 --> 01:36:12,790
Splendid. Splendid!

770
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:17,539
Nick Nack, I expect you to surpass
yourself. He's a cordon bleu, you know?

771
01:36:17,789 --> 01:36:21,663
By the way, where's Miss Goodnight?

772
01:36:21,955 --> 01:36:24,079
Oh, she's around here somewhere.

773
01:36:24,329 --> 01:36:27,078
She can't leave,
so she does as she pleases.

774
01:36:27,328 --> 01:36:29,328
How do you like my island?

775
01:36:29,578 --> 01:36:31,286
A bit off the beaten track.

776
01:36:31,536 --> 01:36:34,827
It's rent-free.
I do my landlords an occasional favour.

777
01:36:35,076 --> 01:36:37,159
A cosy arrangement.

778
01:36:37,409 --> 01:36:40,242
- Servant problem, I suppose?
- Not at all.

779
01:36:40,492 --> 01:36:44,199
Nick Nack does for me very nicely.

780
01:36:45,157 --> 01:36:48,490
Usually there's just us two,
but guests are no inconvenience.

781
01:36:48,740 --> 01:36:53,697
We're entirely self-supporting. We have
every electrical device you can think of.

782
01:36:53,947 --> 01:36:58,821
This is an airlock,
as you are doubtless aware.

783
01:36:59,321 --> 01:37:02,945
Automatic, of course.

784
01:37:03,278 --> 01:37:08,152
Naturally, we have an ample supply
of electricity here.

785
01:37:08,402 --> 01:37:12,026
Let me show you.

786
01:37:26,064 --> 01:37:28,563
This should run
a few electric toothbrushes.

787
01:37:28,813 --> 01:37:32,438
Up here.

788
01:37:35,062 --> 01:37:39,394
A solar-energy station.
So this is what it's all about. Ah!

789
01:37:39,644 --> 01:37:44,476
Thermoelectric generators
to convert solar energy into electricity.

790
01:37:44,726 --> 01:37:47,601
All built by Hai Fat's
construction company, no doubt.

791
01:37:47,850 --> 01:37:52,433
Somehow I seem to have inherited it
from him. It's all fully automated.

792
01:37:52,683 --> 01:37:57,681
Kra looks after maintenance and security
in here. Nick Nack does everything else.

793
01:37:57,931 --> 01:38:01,764
They tell me the electricity
is stored in here... somewhere.

794
01:38:02,014 --> 01:38:05,388
Science was never my strong point.

795
01:38:05,638 --> 01:38:10,387
Superconductivity coils
cooled by liquid helium.

796
01:38:10,637 --> 01:38:15,927
If I were you, I wouldn't stick my finger -
or anything else, for that matter - in there.

797
01:38:16,177 --> 01:38:20,967
At 453% below zero, that liquid helium
would break it off like an icicle.

798
01:38:21,217 --> 01:38:23,842
You really know
far more about it than I do.

799
01:38:24,092 --> 01:38:28,757
I'm arranging for countries that can afford
the price to send experts here to see this.

800
01:38:29,007 --> 01:38:32,215
But no solex
until the money is in the bank, right?

801
01:38:32,465 --> 01:38:33,798
Right.

802
01:38:34,048 --> 01:38:38,338
- I have run across similar situations.
- Not what I've got here.

803
01:38:38,588 --> 01:38:42,004
This way the highest bidder
can build hundreds of stations

804
01:38:42,254 --> 01:38:45,586
and sell franchises for hundreds more.

805
01:38:45,836 --> 01:38:49,002
He will literally have the sun in his pocket.

806
01:38:49,252 --> 01:38:52,168
A monopoly on solar power.

807
01:38:52,418 --> 01:38:56,126
The oil sheikhs will pay you
just to keep solar energy "off" the market.

808
01:38:56,375 --> 01:39:00,416
The thought had occurred to me.

809
01:39:03,374 --> 01:39:07,206
This is the collection point.

810
01:39:19,245 --> 01:39:22,286
Ah! So that's where it belongs.

811
01:39:22,536 --> 01:39:29,451
Our famous solex in the still down there
transmits heat to the thermal generators.

812
01:39:30,201 --> 01:39:33,825
It's collected through this?

813
01:39:36,199 --> 01:39:40,865
But where is it collected from?
You need the sun.

814
01:39:49,113 --> 01:39:52,820
Watch that mushroom-shaped rock.

815
01:40:13,732 --> 01:40:15,065
Ingenious, isn't it?

816
01:40:15,315 --> 01:40:18,522
The panels lock on to the sun,
then track it automatically.

817
01:40:18,772 --> 01:40:22,063
Something like that, yes.

818
01:40:28,145 --> 01:40:33,893
Ah. Reflected through this, those panels
must produce a heat of at least 3,500%F.

819
01:40:34,143 --> 01:40:38,184
If you say so, Mr Bond.

820
01:40:39,809 --> 01:40:46,016
But I do know we can focus the power
wherever we want. Here, I'll show you.

821
01:40:46,890 --> 01:40:50,681
This is a bonus.

822
01:40:51,181 --> 01:40:55,138
Goes with the solex. No extra charge.

823
01:41:15,175 --> 01:41:18,883
This is the part I really like.

824
01:41:27,214 --> 01:41:31,213
Now that's what I call solar power.

825
01:41:31,504 --> 01:41:35,129
That's what I call trouble.

826
01:41:35,420 --> 01:41:41,335
You must admit I am now undeniably
the Man with the Golden Gun.

827
01:41:45,918 --> 01:41:49,542
Lunch.

828
01:42:04,413 --> 01:42:07,579
This way, Mr Bond.

829
01:42:07,829 --> 01:42:10,037
Ah, Miss Goodnight!

830
01:42:10,287 --> 01:42:13,328
- James!
- Aren't we a little overdressed?

831
01:42:13,578 --> 01:42:16,702
I like a girl in a bikini.
No concealed weapons.

832
01:42:16,952 --> 01:42:21,201
Miss Goodnight, please. Mr Bond.

833
01:42:21,367 --> 01:42:24,033
Let's see what Nick Nack has for us.

834
01:42:24,283 --> 01:42:27,907
Ah, mushrooms.

835
01:42:29,865 --> 01:42:32,781
The fried mushroom
looks terribly interesting.

836
01:42:33,031 --> 01:42:38,113
Yes, I'd noticed that.
I'll get around to it later.

837
01:42:39,696 --> 01:42:43,487
- Having fun in the sun, Goodnight?
- Yes!

838
01:42:43,737 --> 01:42:47,361
I could stay here for ever.

839
01:42:48,236 --> 01:42:50,485
Mm, excellent.

840
01:42:50,735 --> 01:42:57,109
- Slightly reminiscent of a '34 Mouton.
- Then I must add it to my cellar.

841
01:42:57,775 --> 01:43:00,608
You live well, Scaramanga.

842
01:43:00,858 --> 01:43:04,774
At a million dollars a contract,
I can afford to, Mr Bond.

843
01:43:05,023 --> 01:43:10,355
You work for peanuts. A "well done" from
the Queen and a pittance of a pension.

844
01:43:10,605 --> 01:43:13,855
Apart from that, we are the same.

845
01:43:14,105 --> 01:43:19,270
To us, Mr Bond. We are the best.

846
01:43:19,603 --> 01:43:25,019
There's a useful four-letter word,
and you're full of it.

847
01:43:26,143 --> 01:43:29,434
When I kill it's under specific orders
of my government.

848
01:43:29,684 --> 01:43:32,392
And those I kill are themselves killers.

849
01:43:32,642 --> 01:43:35,141
Come, come, Mr Bond.
You disappoint me.

850
01:43:35,391 --> 01:43:38,557
You get as much fulfilment
out of killing as I do. Admit it.

851
01:43:38,807 --> 01:43:43,223
- I admit killing you would be a pleasure.
- You should have done that before.

852
01:43:43,472 --> 01:43:47,555
But then the English don't think
it's sporting to kill in cold blood.

853
01:43:47,805 --> 01:43:51,221
Don't count on that.

854
01:44:01,052 --> 01:44:06,633
I could have shot you when you landed,
but that would have been too easy.

855
01:44:09,508 --> 01:44:11,424
You see, Mr Bond,

856
01:44:11,674 --> 01:44:16,131
like every great artist, I want to create
an indisputable masterpiece

857
01:44:16,381 --> 01:44:18,881
once in my lifetime.

858
01:44:19,130 --> 01:44:22,921
The death of 007, "mano a mano",

859
01:44:23,171 --> 01:44:24,879
face to face,

860
01:44:25,129 --> 01:44:27,253
will be mine.

861
01:44:27,503 --> 01:44:31,586
You mean stuffed and displayed
over your rocky mantelpiece.

862
01:44:31,836 --> 01:44:35,710
That's an amusing idea,
but I was thinking in terms of history.

863
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:38,626
A duel between titans.

864
01:44:38,876 --> 01:44:42,042
My golden gun against your Walther PPK.

865
01:44:42,291 --> 01:44:44,749
Each of us with a 50-50 chance.

866
01:44:44,999 --> 01:44:47,374
Six bullets to your one?

867
01:44:47,624 --> 01:44:51,039
I only need one.

868
01:44:52,247 --> 01:44:54,372
Sounds a bit old-fashioned, doesn't it?

869
01:44:54,622 --> 01:44:57,330
I mean, pistols at dawn, that sort of thing.

870
01:44:57,579 --> 01:44:59,829
Indeed it is, Mr Bond.

871
01:45:00,079 --> 01:45:04,078
But it still remains
the only "true" test for gentlemen.

872
01:45:04,328 --> 01:45:08,077
I doubt if you qualify on that score.

873
01:45:09,410 --> 01:45:12,451
However, I accept.

874
01:45:12,701 --> 01:45:18,116
As soon as I have finished this delicious
lunch that Nick Nack has prepared for us.

875
01:45:18,366 --> 01:45:23,698
"Messieurs", I will remind you,
this is "un duel á la mort".

876
01:45:23,948 --> 01:45:27,572
Only one of you
can leave the field of honour.

877
01:45:27,822 --> 01:45:31,071
If a "coup de grâce" is necessary,

878
01:45:31,321 --> 01:45:36,028
as your referee, I will administer it myself.

879
01:45:36,278 --> 01:45:41,277
<i>I do not expect wounds, only a clean kill.</i>

880
01:45:41,527 --> 01:45:47,359
<i>On my command
each contestant will take 20 paces.</i>

881
01:45:47,609 --> 01:45:51,316
Are you ready, Monsieur Scaramanga?

882
01:45:53,024 --> 01:45:56,107
- Ready.
- Are you ready, Monsieur Bond?

883
01:45:56,357 --> 01:46:00,897
- Ready.
- I will now begin the count.

884
01:46:01,147 --> 01:46:03,105
One, two,

885
01:46:03,355 --> 01:46:06,521
three, four, five,

886
01:46:06,771 --> 01:46:11,187
six, seven, eight, nine,

887
01:46:11,437 --> 01:46:14,686
ten, eleven, twelve,

888
01:46:14,936 --> 01:46:16,977
<i>thirteen, fourteen,</i>

889
01:46:17,227 --> 01:46:19,268
fifteen, sixteen,

890
01:46:19,518 --> 01:46:21,143
<i>seventeen, eighteen,</i>

891
01:46:21,392 --> 01:46:25,225
nineteen, twenty!

892
01:47:06,881 --> 01:47:09,006
If you kill him,

893
01:47:09,256 --> 01:47:12,630
all this be mine.

894
01:47:13,921 --> 01:47:17,545
This way, Monsieur Bond.

895
01:47:53,953 --> 01:47:58,952
- Monsieur, good shooting.
- I've never killed a midget before.

896
01:47:59,202 --> 01:48:01,410
But there can always be a first time.

897
01:48:01,660 --> 01:48:05,284
Oh, monsieur!

898
01:49:18,933 --> 01:49:23,432
<i>You only have three bullets left.</i>

899
01:49:36,637 --> 01:49:40,261
<i>I have fooled you.</i>

900
01:52:59,796 --> 01:53:01,920
- Goodnight!
- James!

901
01:53:02,170 --> 01:53:04,170
Oh, James!

902
01:53:04,420 --> 01:53:06,336
Steady, Goodnight.

903
01:53:06,586 --> 01:53:08,502
Where is he?

904
01:53:08,752 --> 01:53:10,918
Flat on his "coup de grâce".

905
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:16,583
Come on, let's get out of this fun palace
and find that solex.

906
01:53:24,373 --> 01:53:26,997
Wait here.
I'll take care of the maintenance man.

907
01:53:27,247 --> 01:53:29,164
I already did.

908
01:53:29,414 --> 01:53:31,121
I laid him out cold.

909
01:53:31,371 --> 01:53:33,288
- You did?
- Yes.

910
01:53:33,538 --> 01:53:37,703
There's more to you than meets the eye.

911
01:53:46,076 --> 01:53:50,075
I hate to ask stupid questions, but
where exactly did you knock him cold?

912
01:53:50,325 --> 01:53:52,991
He landed in that one.

913
01:53:53,241 --> 01:53:55,449
Don't you believe in signs?

914
01:53:55,699 --> 01:54:00,489
We've got five minutes before his body
temperature raises the helium above zero.

915
01:54:00,739 --> 01:54:03,239
Then this whole damn place
will go sky-high.

916
01:54:03,489 --> 01:54:07,113
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

917
01:55:27,135 --> 01:55:30,384
Kill the beam!

918
01:55:30,634 --> 01:55:33,842
- Hit the master override switch!
- The what?

919
01:55:34,092 --> 01:55:36,383
- Goodnight?
- Yes, James?

920
01:55:36,633 --> 01:55:40,548
Now listen carefully.
There's a console up there.

921
01:55:40,798 --> 01:55:46,672
Now, there must be a scanner
interlock button on it. Push it!

922
01:55:46,922 --> 01:55:48,963
Are you still there?

923
01:55:49,213 --> 01:55:54,087
It'll be on the auxiliary feedback circuit.

924
01:55:54,128 --> 01:55:57,378
"Computer interlock... " Is that it?

925
01:55:57,628 --> 01:56:01,543
Just push every damn button, will you?

926
01:56:18,914 --> 01:56:21,163
Good girl, Goodnight. You've done it.

927
01:56:21,413 --> 01:56:25,287
Oh, I have.

928
01:57:06,694 --> 01:57:11,443
Goodnight, get the hell out of there!
I've done it.

929
01:57:43,768 --> 01:57:47,684
- I hope you can swim, Goodnight.
- This way.

930
01:57:47,934 --> 01:57:52,141
His junk is moored around the corner.

931
01:58:54,001 --> 01:58:56,792
- But, darling, who is at the wheel?
- George.

932
01:58:57,042 --> 01:58:58,959
George?

933
01:58:59,208 --> 01:59:01,750
Automatic pilot.

934
01:59:01,999 --> 01:59:08,165
We should make Hong Kong
in about... eight hours.

935
01:59:08,373 --> 01:59:11,997
Give or... take a little.

936
01:59:29,659 --> 01:59:34,158
I always wanted to take
a slow boat "from" China.

937
02:00:19,189 --> 02:00:21,355
I'll kill you.

938
02:00:21,605 --> 02:00:23,938
I'll kill you!

939
02:00:24,188 --> 02:00:27,812
Why, you...!

940
02:01:15,342 --> 02:01:17,800
Hey! Let me out!

941
02:01:18,050 --> 02:01:20,716
Hey, what are you doing?

942
02:01:20,966 --> 02:01:22,757
Ouch!

943
02:01:23,007 --> 02:01:26,464
No, no, no! I can't breathe!

944
02:01:26,714 --> 02:01:29,130
Ow! You'll be sorry.

945
02:01:29,380 --> 02:01:33,088
I may be small, but I never forget.

946
02:01:35,879 --> 02:01:38,253
I kill you if you don't let me out of here!

947
02:01:38,503 --> 02:01:41,502
Ow! Let me out, you big bully!

948
02:01:41,752 --> 02:01:45,376
Shut up.

949
02:01:49,042 --> 02:01:52,666
- What did you do with him?
- What do you think?

950
02:01:52,916 --> 02:01:56,957
- Oh, James, you didn't!
- Yes, I damn well did.

951
02:01:57,207 --> 02:01:59,581
Got all the glass out of the bed, I trust?

952
02:01:59,831 --> 02:02:03,247
We don't want anything else
to disturb our peace,

953
02:02:03,497 --> 02:02:07,121
do we?

954
02:02:11,453 --> 02:02:14,786
Now, where were we?

955
02:02:15,036 --> 02:02:18,660
Oh, James!

956
02:02:19,576 --> 02:02:23,201
Mmm...

957
02:02:27,283 --> 02:02:30,907
What's the matter?

958
02:02:31,157 --> 02:02:34,781
Something came up.

959
02:02:36,572 --> 02:02:37,864
Hello?

960
02:02:38,114 --> 02:02:40,530
Ah, there you are, Bond.

961
02:02:40,780 --> 02:02:43,279
<i>Well done. Congratulations.</i>

962
02:02:43,529 --> 02:02:44,820
Thank you, sir.

963
02:02:45,070 --> 02:02:48,195
<i>Is Miss Goodnight with you?
I'd like a word with her.</i>

964
02:02:48,444 --> 02:02:52,069
Hold on, sir.

965
02:03:00,483 --> 02:03:04,316
<i>Bond? Bond, are you there?</i>

966
02:03:05,024 --> 02:03:07,690
<i>Goodnight?</i>

967
02:03:07,940 --> 02:03:11,564
She's just coming, sir.

968
02:03:16,771 --> 02:03:19,562
Goodnight?

969
02:03:20,062 --> 02:03:23,144
<i>Goodnight?</i>

970
02:03:23,394 --> 02:03:27,018
<i>- Goodnight!
- Good night, sir.</i>

971
02:03:32,809 --> 02:03:36,391
<i># Good night, good night</i>

972
02:03:36,641 --> 02:03:40,640
<i># Sleep well, my dear</i>

973
02:03:40,890 --> 02:03:44,514
<i># No need to fear</i>

974
02:03:44,764 --> 02:03:52,846
<i># James Bond is here</i>

975
02:03:56,136 --> 02:04:00,344
<i># Oh, love is required
# whenever he's hired</i>

976
02:04:00,594 --> 02:04:04,426
<i># It comes just before the kill</i>

977
02:04:04,676 --> 02:04:06,301
<i># No one can catch him</i>

978
02:04:06,551 --> 02:04:08,383
<i># No hit man can match him</i>

979
02:04:08,633 --> 02:04:12,008
<i># For his million-dollar skill</i>

980
02:04:12,257 --> 02:04:16,548
<i># One golden shot
# means another poor victim</i>

981
02:04:16,798 --> 02:04:21,005
<i># Has come to a glittering end</i>

982
02:04:21,255 --> 02:04:24,504
<i># If you want to get rid of someone</i>

983
02:04:24,754 --> 02:04:28,045
<i># The Man with the Golden Gun</i>

984
02:04:28,295 --> 02:04:31,586
<i># Will get it done</i>

985
02:04:31,836 --> 02:04:35,835
<i># He'll shoot anyone</i>

986
02:04:36,085 --> 02:04:42,750
<i># With his golden gun</i>
