You are still a lamb to God.

4
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,953
You are still a lamb to God.

5
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:31,360
You want to see heaven?

6
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:34,759
Don't do this please, please.

7
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:35,969
Shut up.

8
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,138
Please don't hurt me.

9
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:39,272
Get up! Get up.

10
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:41,365
Please, please don't hurt me.

11
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:43,408
- Get the hell up.
- Please don't kill me.

12
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:47,838
Hey, grab him!

13
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:00,887
- Okay, put him down.
- One, two...

14
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:29,316
Action.

15
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:34,553
I'm betting 6.

16
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:36,153
Call.

17
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,253
- Draw.
- 6 fold.

2.8

19
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:43,195
Damn, good one.

20
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,171
So Mister KANG.

21
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:49,843
You're saying you're fine
with your identity

22
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:51,777
laid completely bare online?

23
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:56,008
You'd better know people are
fucking sensitive about eating issues.

24
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,516
Once they find out you let out
carcinogenic substances

25
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:02,082
into the holy Han River
your business is fucked.

26
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,358
Until I build the sewage disposal

27
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:07,560
I told you I'd keep quiet.

28
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,892
So much trouble over
a few pennies.

29
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:18,363
Shit must be getting rough for you
but it's worse for me.

30
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:22,407
Deposit within 3 minutes
or else you'll be in trouble.

31
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,704
Fucking engineer trying to
cheat me.

32
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,755
Don't be a fussy.

33
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,929
Yo what's up
phony reporter?

34
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:48,030
why you hanging out here?
where's my money?

35
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,297
Please give me three more days.

36
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:54,101
That's too long for god's sake.

37
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,038
will three days get me
the principal?

38
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:57,973
Yes!

39
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:59,806
- You better bring it.
- Thank you.

40
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:03,508
If you fucking
hide out on me again

41
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,450
I'm going to dig out your insides.
You got it?

42
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:10,554
- Keep your words!
- I will.

43
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,883
what the fuck is this mess.

44
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:17,086
- Keep your words.
- I will.

45
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:23,231
- Let's head out.
- Yes sir.

46
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,471
- who's next?
- In Mapo.

47
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,255
- Let me borrow your car.
- what?

48
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:46,123
Are you going undercover?
Your <i>outfit</i> is...

49
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,792
Can you call off the
contract case from before?

50
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,204
Dealing with bastards
who swindle women

51
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,906
Means Korea is still on its toes.

52
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:03,209
Reporting things like that
is a bit iffy, no?

53
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:07,009
Reporter?
Take it easy on me, yeah?

54
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,241

No, I'm just traveling around.

81
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:50,725
It's dangerous around here...
The dogs all ran away from lumber camp.

82
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,673
It seems quite quiet around here.

83
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,775
It's because the hill's hidden out.

84
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:59,643
we didn't even know about Korean war
until a while after it broke out.

85
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,814
You can get off.

86
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,862
I have to get permission
from the mayor.

87
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:21,294
He doesn't like strangers
coming into this town.

88
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,998
There he is.

89
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,794
Mayor, where are you headed?

90
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:31,538
- who's that?
- He's just a passerby.

91
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,977
why are you...

92
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,610
His car broke down on
the hills of Osu.

93
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:44,947
I thought he might <i>freeze</i> to death.

94
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:53,391
This is mister Baek's place.
He's gone to Seoul.

95
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,801
It'll be warm enough to sleep
with the fire lit.

96
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:01,264
Get some rest,
I'm heading back to the store.

97
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:04,905
Osuri doesn't go
around without me.

98
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,035
It's all in my hands...

99
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:13,178
Don't wander around at night.

100
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,030
Hey, you!

101
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,066
who are you?

102
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:19,910
- My car broke down...
- what?

103
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:24,547
Mayor let me stay
here for a night.

104
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:28,211
what? Oh... sure.

105
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:36,017
I thought you were a commie
wandering around here.

106
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:38,531
A commie?

107
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:42,228
Yes, those damn communists.

108
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,434
Stop hanging about here
and get back in there.

109
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:59,239
Oh it's you from overseas.

110
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:05,913
Captain CHOI, shouldn't we
run an identity check on him?

111
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:11,155
I'm sure the mayor
took care of it.

112
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:13,294
I doubt there'd be a problem.

113
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:18,204
I don't know if you've noticed

114
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:20,399
But this village is crime-free.

115
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:26,170
I'm quite good at
keeping public order

116
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:30,807
but strangers rarely
come to this village anyway.

117
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:33,449
So you, young man.

118
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:37,112
Don't make any trouble, OK?

119
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:10,711
Stop!

120
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,783
Stop, stop it!

121
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,953
I'm going to start over
with Hyeon-tae!

122
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,726
I'm not getting a divorce.

123
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,661
we'll get back together
when he comes back to Seoul.

124
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:27,805
Then what about me?
If you live with Hyeon-tae?

125
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,605
I'm sorry Yoo-joon.

126
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,574
Stop it!

127
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:40,407

He's a visitor in the town.

I should've at least gotten you
some late night snacks.

Nah, you're no burden.

I'm SO Yoo-jin from Seoul.

- Oh you're last name is SO.
- You're good looking.

154
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:17,371
Maybe because he's from Seoul.

155
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,843
As you know, I'm the
mayor of Osuri.

156

As well as the head of
Osuri elders' association.

157
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:26,885
He's an Order of

158
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,583
Did you fight in the Vietnam war?

159
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:34,725
I went to place some order...
Probably killed around 300?

160
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:39,092
You add 50 people each time
you tell this story.

00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:48,567
OK...
I'm PARK Nam-shik.

163
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,703
You've seen him before.
Say hi.

164
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:54,613
I'm Tack.

165
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:59,710
He works at our mayor's
lumber camp.

166
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,752
He's quite the worker.

167
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:05,324
Nah, that's all bullshit.
This fellow here

168
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:09,061
beat the hell out of all the dogs
at the camp. They all ran away!

169
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,030
Tack loves eating dogs but

170
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,294
he beats up all
the live ones to death.

171
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,868
Alright let's have a drink!

172
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,530
Shall we?
Cheers everyone.

173
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:23,831
So I put a knife to
a Vietnamese bitch's neck.

174
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:27,913
And she was shaking her ass
on top of my stomach

175
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:31,717
in front of her snuffed husband.

176
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:35,278
Woah! A Vietnamese bitch
must've been delirious.

177
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:39,058
what did I tell you I did
after I banged her?

178
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,726
A gunshot to her head, and bang!

179
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,819
Ding, dong, dang!

180
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:46,261
I can listen to this story forever.

181
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:51,036
Madam, your face gets red
in front of the chief

182
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:54,306
and your butt gets tight.
You're still beaming.

183
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,739
She knows men.

184
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,403
- Ouch!
- Don't hit me.

185
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,637
Stop jibbering and just drink.

186
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,445
Mayor.

187
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:06,852
- Hey, PARK.
- where are you going?

188
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,183
Hey, PARK!

189
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:14,618
He's busy.
Let's drink some more.

190
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:21,330
Hey, what do you do for living?

191
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:23,691
I'm a reporter.

192
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,934
I'm actually here to
talk to a friend...

193
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,599
about my girlfriend.

194
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:34,573
He said he's in this town.
Have you... seen him?

195
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:36,579
Nope.

196
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,211
Has anyone seen him?

197
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:40,785
- Nah...
- Nope.

198
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:42,478
I guess not?

199
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:49,891
Let's get up now,
we drank a lot.

200
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,531
Stay still!

201
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,681
You <i>pretty</i> bitch!

202
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,996
You're gorgeous.

203
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:57,186
I'm planning on telling everything
to Hyeon-tae when I meet him.

204
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:03,529
I'm going to tell him
how many times I had you.

205
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:06,435
what! Are you scared?

206
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,373
Hello? Hello?

207
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:25,543
Do you like this?

208
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,979
Tell me you like it.

209
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,787
Oh fuck this is good.

210
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:23,330
Young chicks are the best.

211
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,633
Fucking bitch.

212
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:31,531
who's the girl that was
cleaning up the snow?

213
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:40,372
Her name is Eun-hee.
She's a damn whore.

214
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:44,273
She says she can't
see well at night.

215
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:47,019
- what was it called...
- Night blindness?

216
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:48,748
Yeah, night blindness.

217
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:52,955
Her mom has the same eye disorder
and even some kind of cancer.

218
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:57,554
But our townspeople are generous
to give them food,

219
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:00,756
fire wood, and medicine too.

220
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:05,001
If they were in Seoul, everyone
would just try to fuck them.

221
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:07,663
This town is still warm.

222
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,044
Shit.

223
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:26,756
Let's go in.

224
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:57,587
This is my son,
he went to Seoul.

225
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:00,921
He's quite the brain.

226
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:07,358
He had a rough time after his mom
left him when he was 5 years old.

227
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,768
He's good with machines.
He takes after me.

228
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:15,307
He even made his own gun.

229
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:17,434
So I had to scold him
and take it away.

230
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:18,936
A gun?

231
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:25,013
Right. we make guns here
to go hunting for wild animals.

232
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:33,356
Hey, mister KIM.

233
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,756
what?
There aren't anymore parts?

234
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,059
Get them for me tomorrow.

235
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:51,065
what do I tell the mayor?

236
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:57,872
Can you just
leave the car and go?

237
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,146
Hey, Dong-gu.

238
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:07,526
I expected better of you.
what the hell are you doing?

239
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:09,153
why are you lagging so much?

240
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,262
You're tying him down.

241
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,492
I'm sorry.

242
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:17,793
I shouldn't have been
so generous in the first place.

243
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,127
- I should've said no from the...
- Nevermind!

244
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,829
Be sure to get it fixed
by tomorrow and let him leave.

245
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,499
Yes.

246
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:35,880
<i>The person you called is</i>
<i>not available right now</i>

247
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,677
<i>please leave a message</i>
<i>after the beep.</i>

248
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:42,181
Ah, bastard.

249
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:47,055
where's he hiding?
Fucker.

250
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:47,875
Eun-hee, how are you?

251
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:52,951
were you waiting for me?

252
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:59,862
Good girl.
Come with me...

253
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:06,326
Good girl!
Come here.

254
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:11,371
Listen to me before I hurt you.

255
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:19,847
Good girl.
Hey, don't do that.

256
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:25,449
Come here, come here.

257
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:30,492
Don't make this harder.

258
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:33,698
I won't hurt you like last time.

259
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:37,896
- No!
- I won't hurt you like last time.

260
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:45,537
I said come here!

261
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,310
You bitch!

262
00:30:56,121 --> 00:30:58,783
You fucking bitch!

263
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:02,884
You fucking bit me!

264
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:12,835
You damn whore!
Come here!

265
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:17,039
Don't you dare!

266
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:25,906
You bitch come here!

267
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,890
Bitch! <i>Pretty</i> bitch!

268
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:05,987
This is for the good of both of us.

269
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:18,769
Good job.

270
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,433
Go wash up.

271
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:30,642
You're a bad bitch.

272
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:37,560
It's almost done
just wait up a little.

273
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:49,040
I think the mayor is
a very good person.

274
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:52,847
Of course.
He's got lots of land, too.

275
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:58,354
From this lumber camp
to the farm over there is all his.

276
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,057
He lives alone?

277
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:06,186
Everyone in this town
is a widower.

278
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:13,431
Oh, why is that?

279
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:16,535
what's wrong?

280
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,139
Hey!
what's wrong with you?

281
00:36:24,082 --> 00:36:27,745
It's indigestion.
The sweet potatoes stuck.

282
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,584
what about the car?
Are you done fixing it?

283
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:41,422
No, not yet.
I've been busy dealing with him.

284
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,628
Take him inside.

285
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:07,356
Are you very ill?
You'll be better soon, you're young.

286
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,426
Try eating this.

287
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:14,721
I got some porridge from the
madam at the pub.

288
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:16,060
Thank you.

289
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:22,667
Do you have something to say...?

290
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:25,843
Oh yeah.

291
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:29,580
we're having
a neighborhood patrol rally

292
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,514
in the city next week.

293
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:34,511
I was hoping you could
write the foreword.

294
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:50,128
Captain.

295
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:55,198
what is that box on the
telephone pole?

296
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:56,670
what's in there?

297
00:37:57,041 --> 00:38:00,101
I thought you'd know
as a chief patrol.

298
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:05,409
It's an electric circuit breaker
for Eun-hee's house.

299
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:10,613
Maybe you've heard already
but her eyes are kind of bad.

300
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:13,284
Night blindness?

301
00:38:14,192 --> 00:38:16,023
I see you've heard.

302
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:22,193
Her house is Vietnam war hero
LEE Jong-guk's house.

303
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:25,530
He lent her that house
out of generosity.

304
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:30,231
She can't do anything
without electricity

305
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:33,209
So the electricity bill
was just too much.

306
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:39,715
He decided to turn off the lights
when she went to sleep.

307
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:44,015
And turn on the lights
when morning came.

308
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:46,991
It's strange for us to keep going
in and out of her house.

309
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,891
So we installed it in the streets.

310
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,885
Is your question answered?

311
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:56,926
Mr. LEE seems great.
Just giving out his house like that.

312
00:38:57,134 --> 00:39:01,798
For sure he is!
He's a patriot for sure.

313
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:09,111
Yes, chief.

314
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:11,708
Yeah?

315
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:16,177
You left your keys?

316
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:18,549
Hold on.

317
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:24,684
I left it in my office too.

318
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:32,201
I'll take it to you right now.

319
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:00,794
what took you so long?

320
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:06,131
How can you forget the keys?

321
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:33,592
Go on ahead!

322
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,713
Here, I'm here.

323
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:43,559
Come here.

324
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:09,886
Hey.

325
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:16,590
Woah.
what's wrong with you?

326
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:19,168
Hurry up
if you want to leave today.

327
00:42:19,804 --> 00:42:21,101
Shit.

328
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:44,259
- You gonna get your car fixed?
- Yes, chief.

329
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,160
Dong-gu has nimble hands.

330
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:53,099
You! when you go to Seoul

331
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:56,170
have fun getting laid.

332
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:28,497
why won't this open?

333
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:32,702
Is Osuri really a crime-free town?

334
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:40,146
It's kind of cool. I'm even
a little envious of living here.

335
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,454
There are only a few residents.

336
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:46,082
we know who committed what crime.

337
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:49,815
Everyone just lets everything go.

338
00:43:54,165 --> 00:43:55,723
Does that mean...

339
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,533
There may be crime
but no crime's been revealed.

340
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:01,168
That's what it sounds like.

341
00:44:01,272 --> 00:44:04,833
what are you trying to say?

342
00:44:05,176 --> 00:44:09,374
You know where the
photographer is, right?

343
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:16,452
I don't know!
I just...

344
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:26,887
Hey, you.

345
00:44:27,932 --> 00:44:29,559
Ah, shit.

346
00:44:29,934 --> 00:44:31,993
Did you kill another dog?

347
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:35,401
Yo, you want to
take some to Seoul?

348
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,440
I don't eat dogs.

349
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:43,336
- Then you eat it.
- No! I don't eat dogs.

350
00:44:43,581 --> 00:44:47,449
Just eat the fuck up
and shut up, mother fucker.

351
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:51,155
what, you son of a bitch!
Mother fucker?

352
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:52,923
Yeah! what!
Bring it!

353
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:56,723
I'll sew up that mouth of yours
blabbering to this fucking tagrag.

354
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:58,852
You son of a bitch!

355
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:00,323
why don't you stop now.

356
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:05,502
And you. Stop trying to
figure out this town.

357
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:07,866
Before you get
shredded to pieces.

358
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:16,776
Shithead...

359
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:23,949
That damned son of a bitch.

360
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:20,171
Hey, you.

361
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,191
Ah, shit. Ugh.

362
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:50,785
Eun-hee.

363
00:49:51,889 --> 00:49:55,381
Hey you bitch!
Are you in for this too?

364
00:49:55,926 --> 00:49:58,451
Then don't die you damned bitch.

365
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:51,146
I won't go by myself.

366
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:57,853
I'm going to take you too.

367
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,896
why are you here?
You want to fuck me too?

368
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,940
- Calm down!
- Is that so?

369
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:22,102
Calm down, please!

370
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:01,714
Hello.

371
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:08,891
Hey, honey.
Okay.

372
00:52:24,174 --> 00:52:28,042
Shit.

373
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:41,416
I came here to talk to you.

374
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:43,055
About what.

375
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:49,823
Can you put this down first...

376
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:56,503
what you're going through...

377
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,703
I wanted to run away from it.

378
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:02,168
Then why did you come back?

379
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:04,674
I came back to take you.

380
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:11,020
Lies.

381
00:53:12,723 --> 00:53:16,454
Even the priest and
the photographer.

382
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:20,020
They all said they'd help.

383
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:24,066
They didn't lie.
They probably tried to help you.

384
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:25,759
That's why I came back too.

385
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,270
You're lying.

386
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,066
- It's all a lie.
- Eun-hee...

387
00:53:34,478 --> 00:53:37,038
Mom, I'll get you pain reliever.

388
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:43,217
Go, Eun-hee.
Go...

389
00:53:47,324 --> 00:53:49,884
- Go...
- Mom...

390
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:53,992
I can't go anywhere without you.

391
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:56,265
I'm not leaving.

392
00:53:57,167 --> 00:53:58,600
Go.

393
00:54:00,837 --> 00:54:02,566
No.

394
00:54:14,785 --> 00:54:16,252
Mister.

395
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:20,079
You don't have to help me.

396
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:22,418
Just leave.

397
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,491
I can't go without my mom.

398
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:31,293
I need money for medication too.

399
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:38,171
I know it'll be hard but
can you tell me what's going on?

400
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:39,967
So I can help you.

401
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:48,674
Can you really?

402
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:50,848
Yes.

403
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:57,651
I need evidence,
so I'm going to record this.

404
00:55:10,841 --> 00:55:15,835
It first happened...
when I was fifteen years old.

405
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:24,011
The boys around the village...

406
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:32,752
Old ladies around here said
I seduced the boys.

407
00:55:35,799 --> 00:55:37,266
And then

408
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,971
Dong-gu said

409
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:46,736
he was sorry because of

410
00:55:47,878 --> 00:55:49,903
what his son had done.

411
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:56,348
He said he was real sorry.
He would give me money.

412
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:06,855
But then he also had me.

413
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:11,795
And then he bragged about it
to the other men in town.

414
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:18,864
After that...

415
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:25,470
All the men started
coming every night.

416
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:31,148
Sometimes the patrol and
the mayor would come together.

417
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:34,050
They watched
each other having me!

418
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:39,223
More men came to get me.

419
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:42,259
They did whatever they wanted.

420
00:56:50,941 --> 00:56:52,533
All of them...

421
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:55,477
I want to kill them all.

422
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:02,246
All of them...

423
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:04,611
I want to kill them.

424
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:42,915
Have you seen the camera
the photographer brought?

425
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:48,793
The man at the garage
gave it to the mayor.

426
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:16,050
Are you leaving?
Can you stay with me?

427
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:20,889
I'll be back with the camera.
Let's run away with your mom after.

428
00:58:22,399 --> 00:58:26,961
You're really coming back, right?

429
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:33,297
I'll be back by noon.
wait for me.

430
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:55,413
I knew it.
Mother fucker.

431
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:43,035
Let's go in.

432
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:47,602
PARK has something to say?

433
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:51,242
I think he has something to say
about Eun-hee's mom.

434
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:54,416
why?
Is she almost dead?

435
01:00:54,784 --> 01:00:58,185
I think so. we'll talk about
the details inside.

436
01:00:58,321 --> 01:00:59,583
Alright.

437
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:04,491
Oh geez... Happy!
Did you do this?

438
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,186
Mayor, I'm here.

439
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:08,998
How are you all?

440
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:10,667
He's all chilling out.

441
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,225
It's cold, come on in.

442
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:13,629
Phew, it's cold.

443
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:15,726
Come sit over here.

444
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,764
Sit here.

445
01:01:24,747 --> 01:01:26,180
Let's have a drink too.

446
01:01:26,316 --> 01:01:28,151
Dong-gu, bring in some alcohol.

447
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:29,209
Alright.

448
01:01:50,506 --> 01:01:52,804
Hurry up and bring it out.

449
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:54,239
Okay!

450
01:02:04,787 --> 01:02:07,323
So, Eun-hee's mom is
almost dead?

451
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:11,453
It seems that way.

452
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:16,227
I thought she'd live a bit more.

453
01:02:16,532 --> 01:02:19,057
It's not looking very good.

454
01:02:19,836 --> 01:02:25,468
If her mom dies,
Eun-hee will run away.

455
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:29,234
I had a hard time last time too.
That bitch is quick.

456
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:36,686
If she runs away
everything will be ruined.

457
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:38,449
what do we do now?

458
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:43,783
Let's stop it now.

459
01:02:45,328 --> 01:02:50,356
- Stop what?
- we'll get caught if it goes on.

460
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:54,971
would she go anywhere?
She likes the taste of men.

461
01:02:54,971 --> 01:02:56,005
Honestly, if we...

462
01:02:56,005 --> 01:03:00,710
As long as we finish off well
then we can keep on...

463
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:03,873
- He's right!
- Hold on.

464
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:10,411
I think so.
This is getting dangerous.

465
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:12,989
From what I saw last time.

466
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:16,652
She's <i>pretty</i> damn resentful.

467
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:19,762
If her mom dies
Eun-hee won't stay still.

468
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:24,831
Dong-gu, let's end this.
Go get rid of Eun-hee this time.

469
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:26,392
Let's end this all.

470
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:29,366
- I don't want to.
- why not?

471
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:33,066
After I got rid of
the priest and the photographer

472
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:36,373
I can't even sleep at night.
I have nightmares all the time.

473
01:03:36,713 --> 01:03:39,449
If you never started
then we would've never!

474
01:03:39,449 --> 01:03:41,084
This trouble wouldn't have started.

475
01:03:41,084 --> 01:03:43,279
Don't say such things.

476
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,979
who took advantage
of her the most?

477
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:47,557
Last time you said you
would try something new

478
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:50,827
and put a condom over a gun
to push it inside her.

479
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:52,920
Are you even a human being?

480
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,991
what the fuck!
None of us can say that.

481
01:03:56,933 --> 01:04:00,198
we're all beasts to Eun-hee.
You and me.

482
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:03,039
That's too much.
Don't say such things.

483
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:04,374
It's okay, it's okay.

484
01:04:04,374 --> 01:04:08,504
You can treats whores that way.

485
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:11,547
Dong-gu has a point too though.

486
01:04:11,547 --> 01:04:13,249
Dong-gu got rid of
two men last time

487
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:15,945
we can't tell him to
do that again.

488
01:04:16,085 --> 01:04:17,382
I'll do it.

489
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:21,189
- You will?
- Yeah.

490
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:28,119
I don't have many days to live.
I think it's right I do this.

491
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:29,490
How?

492
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:37,031
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

493
01:04:37,407 --> 01:04:41,241
This way, I'll feel better
about my grandson in Seoul.

494
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:44,608
He makes sense.

495
01:04:45,748 --> 01:04:48,239
- with a gun?
- Yeah.

496
01:04:48,818 --> 01:04:53,689
No way! Villagers will be shocked
at the gunshot sound.

497
01:04:53,689 --> 01:04:57,917
That's not a problem.
who cares?

498
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:01,325
we've used guns much more
to kill wild dogs.

499
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:04,859
what about the corpse?

500
01:05:05,168 --> 01:05:08,934
wouldn't people be suspicious?
If both of them die from gunshot.

501
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:10,402
That's an issue.

502
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:16,073
I'll do it.
I have a grinder.

503
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:20,344
Good.
This is the story.

504
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:23,575
Eun-hee's mom died
from her illness.

505
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:27,816
Eun-hee was in despair, and

506
01:05:28,357 --> 01:05:31,520
jumped into a grinder.
who can rebuke?

507
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:35,397
- That's nice.
- No blood involved.

508
01:05:36,732 --> 01:05:39,997
Cheers!
Let's get this over with.

509
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:42,430
- Go on.
- Do it right.

510
01:05:44,874 --> 01:05:45,675
Manager PARK!

511
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:48,007
- Let me go!
- Come here.

512
01:05:48,144 --> 01:05:50,044
- Just forget it.
- Yeah.

513
01:05:51,747 --> 01:05:52,907
Hey, Dong-gu.

514
01:05:55,017 --> 01:05:58,454
Remember the photographer?
Put him in the grinder too.

515
01:05:58,454 --> 01:05:59,789
Yes, I will.

516
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:02,553
where'd you put his camera
by the way?

517
01:06:02,692 --> 01:06:04,159
It's in the dog house.

518
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,918
Let's get rid of that too.

519
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:09,256
- Alright.
- Do it.

520
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:42,187
<i>You are still a lamb to God.</i>

521
01:07:45,194 --> 01:07:47,628
<i>Please, please don't hurt me.</i>

522
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:50,630
<i>Don't do this please.</i>

523
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:54,003
<i>Please don't hurt me.</i>

524
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:56,267
- <i>Get up! Get up.</i>
<i>- Please, don't do this.</i>

525
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:05,193
Oh my...

526
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:07,997
Hyeon-tae...

527
01:10:10,406 --> 01:10:12,806
Hyeon-tae, Hyeon-tae...

528
01:10:15,444 --> 01:10:21,405
Hyeon-tae...

529
01:11:07,897 --> 01:11:12,266
Hey you! Reporter!
You going for a cover?

530
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:16,503
Don't you dare do anything.

531
01:11:35,424 --> 01:11:36,789
Stop!

532
01:11:39,094 --> 01:11:40,686
Come out.

533
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:55,143
That bastard!

534
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:33,504
what the fuck...
why the hell is he here?

535
01:13:38,347 --> 01:13:43,080
Fucking grandpa.
He's got temper.

536
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:02,236
Die you fucker.
Die!

537
01:14:06,342 --> 01:14:11,575
Hey Chief Choi.
Hurry up and check it out.

538
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:20,183
Yeah call me if
there's anything wrong.

539
01:14:35,537 --> 01:14:36,561
Let's go.

540
01:14:38,607 --> 01:14:41,735
- You'll die if you don't go now.
- I can't!

541
01:14:46,081 --> 01:14:49,050
- Hurry, leave.
- No, mom.

542
01:14:49,184 --> 01:14:56,181
I'm okay honey.
Go with him.

543
01:14:57,393 --> 01:15:06,859
- No, I won't.
- Do my last wish and go.

544
01:15:08,771 --> 01:15:13,208
- No!
- You promised.

545
01:15:15,144 --> 01:15:21,413
You can't live like a human being
unless you leave this place.

546
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:25,044
- No, no!
- Go on now.

547
01:15:26,388 --> 01:15:30,188
Listen to mom.
Go on...

548
01:15:41,303 --> 01:15:42,702
Hey.

549
01:15:44,973 --> 01:15:46,497
Please give me some space.

550
01:15:50,412 --> 01:15:52,243
I'll be right out.

551
01:16:30,519 --> 01:16:31,986
Mom...

552
01:16:34,623 --> 01:16:35,954
I'm sorry.

553
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:40,658
I'm so sorry...

554
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:14,283
- <i>Hey are you there?</i>
- Yeah.

555
01:19:14,283 --> 01:19:15,750
<i>What's going on?</i>

556
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:18,911
That reporter bastard
didn't go to Seoul yesterday.

557
01:19:19,054 --> 01:19:22,353
<i>- Did you meet Chief LEE?</i>
- I don't even see him.

558
01:19:22,457 --> 01:19:23,558
<i>What the fuck!</i>

559
01:19:23,558 --> 01:19:25,492
I'm right after you so,

560
01:19:25,661 --> 01:19:27,185
<i>Hurry on here.</i>

561
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:43,772
Dong-gu you dumb shit!
Hurry up and get your ass here.

562
01:19:44,246 --> 01:19:47,647
Do you know what you've done?

563
01:19:47,849 --> 01:19:51,808
The reporter from Seoul
ran away with Eun-hee!

564
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:55,447
If he gets out of here alive
you know we're all fucked right?

565
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:59,488
If anything goes wrong
I'll kill you first.

566
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:01,926
Get your ass here!
Now!

567
01:20:26,154 --> 01:20:30,716
Fucking reporter.
You're dead.

568
01:21:06,228 --> 01:21:07,354
Jang.

569
01:21:08,130 --> 01:21:10,792
what.
what the hell happened.

570
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:14,970
Save me.
Take me to the hospital.

571
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:18,167
You old shit.
You're useless!

572
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:23,805
Go die!
Fucking die!

573
01:21:24,146 --> 01:21:27,582
You retarded old shithead!

574
01:21:28,016 --> 01:21:32,654
If Eun-hee gets out of Osuri
we're all doomed. Go after them!

575
01:21:32,654 --> 01:21:37,216
They'll be heading to the stream.
That's the only way out. Let's go.

576
01:22:15,964 --> 01:22:17,727
This bitch!

577
01:22:18,834 --> 01:22:22,167
Fucking bitch. what the fuck
do you think you're doing!

578
01:22:22,571 --> 01:22:23,902
where did he go!

579
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:25,971
where did he go!

580
01:22:30,979 --> 01:22:33,470
Eun-hee, hurry.

581
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:42,582
Eun-hee!

582
01:22:44,059 --> 01:22:45,651
Eun-hee, let's just go!

583
01:22:46,495 --> 01:22:47,519
Eun-hee.

584
01:22:48,563 --> 01:22:51,623
- Don't do this Eun-hee...
- Hey!

585
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:53,725
Don't do this.

586
01:22:56,071 --> 01:22:57,197
what the hell?

587
01:22:57,873 --> 01:23:01,001
Isn't that CHOI's gunshot?

588
01:23:01,376 --> 01:23:03,776
who knows.
Let's go.

589
01:23:29,037 --> 01:23:31,562
Mayor, he only knows
the way he came in.

590
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,775
where his car broke down.

591
01:23:34,876 --> 01:23:37,379
I'll head on over there
and wait for him.

592
01:23:37,379 --> 01:23:40,280
Nam-shik and mayor,
you two go this way.

593
01:23:40,382 --> 01:23:44,751
Alright, sounds like a plan.
Nam-shik, let's go!

594
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:14,481
Go get him.

595
01:24:23,825 --> 01:24:26,123
That little fucker.

596
01:24:36,338 --> 01:24:37,965
Hey Nam-shik, come here.

597
01:24:39,307 --> 01:24:43,107
Take this and chase after them.

598
01:24:43,278 --> 01:24:45,212
I'll go that way.
Run.

599
01:24:45,513 --> 01:24:46,980
They're getting away!

600
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:15,034
Be careful!

601
01:25:50,845 --> 01:25:51,971
Shit.

602
01:26:07,629 --> 01:26:10,860
we can go to your car
once we get past this hill.

603
01:26:58,813 --> 01:27:00,610
Oh... fuck.

604
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:19,389
Eun-hee, I'm sorry.

605
01:27:22,337 --> 01:27:23,929
It's all my fault.

606
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:29,569
I'm your mom's
high school friend.

607
01:27:31,179 --> 01:27:34,615
Eun-hee, if I didn't give you
medicine for mom.

608
01:27:35,483 --> 01:27:37,576
She would've died long ago.

609
01:27:38,386 --> 01:27:39,512
Eun-hee.

610
01:27:40,622 --> 01:27:44,319
You fucking whore!

611
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:48,293
I wouldn't have done it
if you resisted!

612
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:51,533
I thought you liked it.

613
01:27:51,533 --> 01:27:53,728
You bitch!

614
01:27:53,868 --> 01:27:56,837
Fuck!

615
01:28:47,188 --> 01:28:51,124
This is hell...

616
01:29:45,947 --> 01:29:47,574
I'll go turn on the engine.

617
01:29:47,682 --> 01:29:50,742
when I honk
come to the car, okay?

618
01:29:55,857 --> 01:29:57,984
It won't take long
don't worry.

619
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:11,035
If they try to attack, put this on
their body and press the button.

620
01:30:47,942 --> 01:30:49,068
Fucking...

621
01:30:53,681 --> 01:30:55,046
Come out you little bastard.

622
01:30:56,217 --> 01:30:57,616
Come out.

623
01:31:15,403 --> 01:31:17,472
- where did you take Eun-hee!
- <i>Crazy</i> bastard.

624
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:20,407
where's Eun-hee!
where's she, you fucking bastard!

625
01:31:21,576 --> 01:31:25,808
Osuri is ruined because of you
little mother fucker.

626
01:31:25,947 --> 01:31:29,678
- where did Eun-hee go!
- Fuck you, mother fucker.

627
01:31:40,528 --> 01:31:43,156
where is she!

628
01:31:43,464 --> 01:31:46,661
This town is ruined
because of you.

629
01:31:46,768 --> 01:31:48,497
Say your last good-bye...

630
01:32:00,014 --> 01:32:01,276
Are you okay?

631
01:32:01,783 --> 01:32:04,581
Let's go to the car.

632
01:32:29,110 --> 01:32:31,772
Dong-gu!
These little bitches...

633
01:33:42,817 --> 01:33:45,081
<i>CRIMELESS VILLAGE</i>
<i>GOOD-BYE</i>

634
01:34:19,153 --> 01:34:21,053
Don't blink.

635
01:34:24,358 --> 01:34:25,916
Okay, done.

636
01:34:38,072 --> 01:34:40,973
Do you want to get
another check-up in Seoul?

637
01:34:41,542 --> 01:34:45,535
No it's okay.
It's not that serious.

638
01:34:49,383 --> 01:34:50,714
Mister.

639
01:34:52,987 --> 01:34:54,420
Thank you...

640
01:34:56,290 --> 01:34:59,691
No, thank you.

641
01:35:00,428 --> 01:35:04,194
I can finally

642
01:35:04,765 --> 01:35:06,824
get my head straight.

643
01:35:09,337 --> 01:35:14,331
I've learned so much...

644
01:35:21,482 --> 01:35:24,918
Okay, I've beat him up
as much as you wanted.

645
01:35:27,922 --> 01:35:29,617
Good job.

646
01:35:35,863 --> 01:35:37,296
Hey, say "Ah".

647
01:35:44,939 --> 01:35:46,804
This will get you some soju.

648
01:35:48,476 --> 01:35:50,569
I think my boys hit you
a little more than I told them to.

649
01:35:52,179 --> 01:35:53,476
Good work.

650
01:35:55,249 --> 01:35:57,080
- Let's go.
- Yes sir.

651
01:35:58,319 --> 01:36:00,253
what are you looking at.

652
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:08,021
Hey, phony!

653
01:36:08,929 --> 01:36:13,957
You know what's similar among
a reporter, sperm, and a loan shark?

654
01:36:15,202 --> 01:36:18,660
It's damn hard to
become a human being.

655
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:21,505
we're no human beings

656
01:36:22,009 --> 01:36:25,911
So let's never run into each other.
Understand?

657
01:36:27,481 --> 01:36:29,039
- Let's go.
- Yes sir.

658
01:36:49,070 --> 01:36:51,038
Fucking wild dogs...
