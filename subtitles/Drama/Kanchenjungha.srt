00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,844
KANCHENJUNG

2
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,727
Cast: Chhabi Biswas,
Karuna Banerjee,

3
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,354
Pahari Sanyal, Anil Chatterjee,

4
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,315
Anubha Gupta, N. Visanathan
Haridan Mukherjee,

5
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:27,777
Alaknanda Roy, Arun Mukherjee.

6
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:37,704
Operator: Subrato Mitra.

7
00:01:12,914 --> 00:01:16,868
Song of Tagore performed
by Ami Tagore.

8
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:47,524
Plot, script and mueyka:
Satyajit Rey.

9
00:02:43,568 --> 00:02:45,738
Good afternoon! Good afternoon!

10
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:47,769
I was on the same top.

11
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:49,751
On the top of the mountain?

12
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,819
But not very... Partly cloudy...

13
00:02:55,272 --> 00:02:58,272
It's a pity! It was wonderful
in this brick house up there.

14
00:02:59,132 --> 00:03:04,512
Yes, this is the most beautiful
chain of snow peaks in the world.

15
00:03:04,523 --> 00:03:06,523
You did not see her either?

16
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:07,953
Not in this place?

17
00:03:08,377 --> 00:03:10,567
Have you been here two weeks?

18
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:13,567
17 days...

19
00:03:14,045 --> 00:03:15,045
Are you leaving tomorrow?

20
00:03:16,179 --> 00:03:19,179
Yes... at five in the morning.

21
00:03:22,865 --> 00:03:25,865
What a nuisance?
I hope you will be lucky next time.

22
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,884
Why are you carrying this?

23
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,429
I'll make a last attempt today.

24
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,640
I heard her call.

25
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,559
That is, my bird still exists.

26
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:49,437
Kanchenjunga also exists.

27
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,397
Did you see her at
this time anywhere?

28
00:03:51,702 --> 00:03:53,018
This bird.

29
00:03:54,824 --> 00:03:56,295
Can I fry it?

30
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,030
Can you fry this bird?

31
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:01,831
Yes, this bird is migratory.

32
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,785
So it does not interest me?

33
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:05,598
It's an amazing bird.

34
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,289
Close your book.

35
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,986
Understand if they are ready.

36
00:04:29,976 --> 00:04:31,976
- Labonia!
- Expensive.

37
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:32,981
Ready?

38
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,217
Wait a minute.

39
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:38,342
And the young lady?

40
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,277
His Grace is impatient.

41
00:04:46,002 --> 00:04:47,203
Mama!

42
00:04:47,592 --> 00:04:48,633
Yes?

43
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:52,096
I do not want to change.

44
00:04:54,097 --> 00:04:56,897
Dress what you usually wear.

45
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,426
Excuse me, Uncle!

46
00:05:29,421 --> 00:05:31,564
What's the rush?

47
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,168
Photo!
Atelier will soon be closed.

48
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,271
Will close soon!

49
00:05:38,468 --> 00:05:40,548
Fasten your shoes.

50
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,262
Today I skated and skated.

51
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,765
Well, no one stopped you.

52
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,351
Did you say goodbye to your dad?

53
00:06:02,284 --> 00:06:03,284
Mistress!

54
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,330
Today is the most critical day.

55
00:06:55,134 --> 00:06:56,582
Do you understand this?

56
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:02,380
If he is our son-in-law...

57
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:05,128
It must be an acquisition.

58
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,261
Have you talked to him?

59
00:07:10,442 --> 00:07:11,442
So what?

60
00:07:12,463 --> 00:07:13,463
Good!

61
00:07:13,515 --> 00:07:14,851
A beautiful bird.

62
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,428
My beautiful bird.

63
00:07:23,263 --> 00:07:24,527
Why so late?

64
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,737
I packed your things.

65
00:07:27,307 --> 00:07:29,866
"I forgot your scarf..."
Well, okay!

66
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:33,931
Today it's sunny.
Monisha is ready?

67
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,120
Yeah almost.

68
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,542
Well, let's go.
You can not go fast.

69
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,601
Wait wait.

70
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,770
Would you rise?

71
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,040
What's the matter?

72
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,695
Why do not we spend
the day with others?

73
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:12,783
From tomorrow you
can do anything.

74
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,744
For Monishi, please...

75
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,207
He made her an offer?

76
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,418
- No.
- What's next?

77
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:24,795
Maybe today...

78
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:29,425
Is this something like
a weather forecast?

79
00:08:30,728 --> 00:08:33,502
What people think...
how it will be adjusted,

80
00:08:34,685 --> 00:08:38,354
how can you even predict this?

81
00:08:39,974 --> 00:08:41,974
I'll be surprised
if he does not.

82
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:46,150
It's easy to guess, at
least not for a woman.

83
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,694
Poor Monisha!

84
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:50,987
Why poor?

85
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,033
She is treated like a puppy.

86
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,287
She has her own will!

87
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,255
Someone she was in this family?

88
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,342
I think only the will
of the host matters.

89
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:17,056
If you knew a boy, you
would not say that.

90
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,392
We have met.

91
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,643
Is not he beautiful?

92
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,057
It's not that it's beautiful
or not beautiful.

93
00:09:26,058 --> 00:09:27,547
But he does not fit Mani.

94
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,903
I know your sister
better than you.

95
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,447
She will not be happy.

96
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,578
You, too, are engaged
in weather forecasts.

97
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,373
Of course, Monisha can refuse.

98
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,919
But this may not happen.

99
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:52,633
She was taught that personal
happiness does not count.

100
00:09:54,038 --> 00:09:55,960
For her, it does not matter.

101
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,347
Monisha.

102
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,104
Give me a hairpin, please!

103
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,807
- Are you not ready yet?
- Nearly.

104
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,317
Without earrings?

105
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,320
And that they are not?

106
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,956
What a girl! When will you put
on these wonderful earrings?

107
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,894
Monisha, come here.

108
00:10:29,816 --> 00:10:30,880
Do you like him?

109
00:10:32,342 --> 00:10:33,342
Like who?

110
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,182
Who!

111
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,553
- I don't know.
- No?

112
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:43,934
Will you listen to me?

113
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,330
Do not marry until
you fall in love.

114
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:52,046
Suitable - does not mean anything.

115
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:57,051
Even this person can come up.
You know it?

116
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:58,908
How are you, Shankard.

117
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,081
Do you ever stop?

118
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,876
You can not keep silent all the time!

119
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,088
Last time I visited
here in 1927.

120
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:13,989
25 years!

121
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,100
It's true that you should not
go uphill at a certain age.

122
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,645
Only young can.

123
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,855
If you speak, you will
lose your breath.

124
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,433
There is no need to
boast of your wisdom.

125
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,697
Yes, to conquer the heights
follows the young.

126
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,250
Can you understand what she thinks?

127
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,919
I can not?

128
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,670
Why can not you?

129
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,927
I do not have a clue
to her thoughts.

130
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,052
Did she say anything to you?

131
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,928
- No.
- Why not?

132
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,765
She does not share her thoughts.

133
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,310
What do you think?

134
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,448
I don't know.

135
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,399
Okay. What does
instinct tell you?

136
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:17,361
In the end, you are a woman
and, not the most stupid.

137
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,577
- She is good.
- On, of course!

138
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,703
It's not just good!
She's one in a million!

139
00:12:27,304 --> 00:12:30,568
Her initial salary
was 1200 per month!

140
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:36,616
Good afternoon.

141
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,426
Thank God some gentlemen
have remained, otherwise...

142
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:51,020
people would forget how
to stay awake in old age.

143
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,442
Darjeeling!

144
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,480
Darjeeling!

145
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,528
Darjeeling!

146
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,283
You wanted to come here.

147
00:13:04,947 --> 00:13:05,966
And I was right!

148
00:13:05,967 --> 00:13:10,833
Best... the best
place for your mom.

149
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,595
C tomorrow no climb.

150
00:13:25,234 --> 00:13:26,234
No ascents?

151
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:33,976
Do I have to stay at the
hotel like a frog in a well?

152
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,532
Let's sit down.

153
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,567
It's 12:15.

154
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,420
Hi, how are you?

155
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:11,934
Well, that's the Mall! Once there
was a stage for the orchestra.

156
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,667
Sit down for a minute.

157
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:18,399
"Not for a minute" but...
forever!

158
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,362
Give me the recipe.

159
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,198
Only a recipe? Take the money.

160
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,910
Look at the shops down there?

161
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,956
Go down that way there
will be a pharmacy.

162
00:14:34,921 --> 00:14:35,942
Go and...

163
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:51,724
Oh, look, where we have brought.
The boiling cauldron!

164
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,433
Who is it?

165
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,103
Indranath Chaudhary,
'Reibahadour'.

166
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,230
President of five companies!

167
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,859
Where are you going?

168
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,195
I must introduce you to him.

169
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:09,098
I was his son's tutor.

170
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,868
Listen to this.

171
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:15,456
"Do not talk to him about work for me."
"Do not you need it?"

172
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,793
Did you get that family inheritance?
Why should not I ask?

173
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,921
This is not the right place.

174
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,342
"Then where?" "In Calcutta!"

175
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,279
It seems that it is not good...

176
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,681
Does it seem right to
stagger like a tramp?

177
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,894
Do not you know that you can not
move forward without support?

178
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,230
How many times have
you been interviewed?

179
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,030
Do not you recognize me?
How are you?

180
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,200
- Good. How are you?
- How is your son?

181
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:54,301
You!

182
00:15:55,412 --> 00:16:00,125
I was your son's tutor in 1951.

183
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,087
Shiv Shankar Roy.

184
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,548
With great respect to you.
This is my nephew, Ashok.

185
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:18,102
"Do you know her?"
This is my youngest daughter.

186
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:23,607
- She was a little girl then.
- Now she is already big, she is in college.

187
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,068
How many more will you be here?

188
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,090
"We're leaving tomorrow."
it is wonderful!

189
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,657
We were lucky that
we met you today.

190
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:36,537
What I actually wanted to say...
please do not forget about my nephew.

191
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:40,541
Why should I remember him?
What is special about it?

192
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,585
He graduated from college 2 years ago.

193
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:50,468
Unfortunately, he lost his father,
that is, my elder brother.

194
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:56,515
You see... if you do not...
then he can not...

195
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,569
Where did you study?
"Ah, it's you!"

196
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,782
- Bangbashi!
- I studied at the President.

197
00:17:15,014 --> 00:17:16,323
English?

198
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,496
How did you find out about this?
"I thought a lot."

199
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:25,878
I also read a lot on Bengali.
Have you graduated in Bengali?

200
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,046
No, it's history.

201
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:34,845
Exams are coming soon.
"I have books with me."

202
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,765
- Do you study?
- No.

203
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,184
Why? It's too beautiful here.

204
00:17:40,353 --> 00:17:43,772
I mostly look out the window.

205
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:45,846
Well it does not count.

206
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,989
Tagore never put his desk at the window.

207
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,159
Have you waited a long time?

208
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,087
"I lost the bet."
"But it's not evening yet."

209
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:13,926
I think that snow peaks will
not show through the clouds.

210
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,846
Take it now. Later may not work.

211
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,600
Why should I?
Let's wait until the evening.

212
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,342
Well, please.

213
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,439
- Did you drink tea?
- Oh sure.

214
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,777
We were just thinking
of going for a walk.

215
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,781
We will not have such an
opportunity in Calcutta.

216
00:18:36,863 --> 00:18:39,743
Well, maybe we'll meet
somewhere in an hour?

217
00:18:40,347 --> 00:18:41,689
Why not? Where?

218
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,415
There is something like a shelter
near Oakden. Beautiful view.

219
00:18:45,569 --> 00:18:48,499
Maybe there we will see
what we are not going to see.

220
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:11,483
I can not refrain from admiring
the sight of your earrings.

221
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,695
You gave them to me.

222
00:19:14,706 --> 00:19:16,366
Actually?

223
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,199
You gave me so much.

224
00:19:19,813 --> 00:19:21,006
Do not say that!

225
00:19:31,264 --> 00:19:32,796
Where now?

226
00:19:35,554 --> 00:19:36,971
According to your choice.

227
00:19:39,055 --> 00:19:41,597
I found the flower you
were talking about.

228
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,099
Where is he?

229
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,644
Do you want to see it?
Come, I'll show it to you.

230
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,152
I made the initial push.

231
00:19:56,236 --> 00:20:00,073
The rest depends on you.
What are you waiting for? Go!

232
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:36,443
- Can I leave myself?
- Let's take a look.

233
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:41,198
These are your photos.

234
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,215
I can not live without them.

235
00:20:43,786 --> 00:20:45,577
Take this one.

236
00:20:52,988 --> 00:20:54,322
This one I like.

237
00:20:55,904 --> 00:20:58,136
I used a timer to make them.

238
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,968
Do not I look like a movie star?

239
00:21:02,588 --> 00:21:04,511
A movie star, my grandmother!

240
00:21:12,028 --> 00:21:13,028
Actually?

241
00:21:13,322 --> 00:21:15,327
I am the most proud
person on Earth.

242
00:21:18,648 --> 00:21:20,900
Pride does not lead to good.

243
00:21:22,183 --> 00:21:23,613
Never mind.

244
00:21:27,147 --> 00:21:28,906
I should not drink this.

245
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:31,055
I gained an extra 3 pounds.

246
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:40,632
Lily, tell me!
Did you have someone before me?

247
00:21:42,305 --> 00:21:43,971
And what about your past?

248
00:21:45,395 --> 00:21:46,513
My past!

249
00:21:48,024 --> 00:21:50,671
What do you say about the
girl with whom you skated?

250
00:21:52,138 --> 00:21:54,308
Well, it's over with.

251
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:56,188
- Who is it?
- No one.

252
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,316
No one!

253
00:21:59,028 --> 00:22:00,146
It's just Bunty.

254
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,499
Banty Chatterjee-She
lives in our hotel.

255
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,664
It's yours...

256
00:22:13,576 --> 00:22:15,763
Do not be too inquisitive.

257
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,185
Look what you did!
I asked you to hurry.

258
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,022
Do not carp!
What are we going to do now?

259
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:39,775
I have to go shopping.

260
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,487
- Have not you finished yet?
- Some things left.

261
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:47,199
Well, go your way,
I'll go my own way.

262
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,669
- What?
- Come here.

263
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:01,922
- Do you have money?
- What are you wasting all about?

264
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,127
Why would I ask?

265
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:07,386
- How many?
- 20 rupees.

266
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,938
Well, did you drop
everything on the races?

267
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:05,180
Give me please. Give me please.
I am poor and blind.

268
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:11,515
Give me please. Give me please.
I am poor and blind.

269
00:24:18,185 --> 00:24:20,625
We walked twice in a circle.
And again here we go.

270
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:43,981
Good?

271
00:24:48,408 --> 00:24:51,348
- Is that the one?
- Yes.

272
00:25:04,449 --> 00:25:06,563
I made a long trip to find it.

273
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:07,755
Really?

274
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,051
You do not believe?

275
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,178
I do not know.

276
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:19,166
Believe it or not.
But this is not true.

277
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,644
There is a gentleman...

278
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:25,398
in a hotel that knows everything
about flowers. I asked him.

279
00:25:30,984 --> 00:25:36,502
But, if he did not prompt, I
would have found it myself.

280
00:25:38,316 --> 00:25:39,316
Thank you.

281
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:22,143
It would be nice if the
wedding was in December.

282
00:26:23,685 --> 00:26:25,205
There is no better time than December.

283
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,584
What did you say?

284
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:27,918
And her studies?

285
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,090
And exams?

286
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:37,337
From schoolgirls will jump
Straight to the crown.

287
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,015
I've learned enough.

288
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:47,272
An educated woman can easily
tear a man up to the thread.

289
00:26:55,794 --> 00:26:56,794
Wonderful view!

290
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,913
If we could see the ridge.

291
00:27:06,331 --> 00:27:07,531
Only one moment.

292
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:11,004
Everything would be perfect!

293
00:27:14,897 --> 00:27:16,344
Let me rest.

294
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:20,740
Are you not feeling well?

295
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,772
What's bothering you?

296
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,794
I feel that something
is bothering you.

297
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:44,245
You see, Monisha knows
very well that...

298
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:48,875
I fully approve
of this marriage.

299
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:53,254
I gave her this quite
unambiguously.

300
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:58,706
Why worry if it does not
go against our desire?

301
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,054
Do not worry.

302
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,924
You in fact think of it?

303
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,425
Well, then?

304
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,246
She has her own head on her shoulders...

305
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,234
Precisely because we want...

306
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:21,116
Do not be mistaken.
How old is she, twenty?

307
00:28:21,822 --> 00:28:23,316
- Nineteen.
- It is the same.

308
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:27,235
The mind of a nineteen-year-old, and
the experience of my sixty years.

309
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,707
Is it still a difference?

310
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:34,712
Will we be so stupid as
to cause her any harm?

311
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,890
She knows what our
support means.

312
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:41,344
Anima quickly agreed
to a marriage.

313
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,921
So is she badly married?

314
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,265
Anima and Monisha are different.

315
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:50,395
I know this, but they
have one thing in common.

316
00:28:50,489 --> 00:28:53,021
They belong to one
traditional family.

317
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:57,360
When my father organized
my wedding...

318
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,112
I did not ask him anything...

319
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:04,233
neither regretted later.
And you?

320
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,660
Everything is normal.

321
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,144
Everything is normal.
I say that everything is fine.

322
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:11,777
And nothing to worry about.

323
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,864
What are you all frowning at?

324
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:23,284
You know, I'm an optimist,
I do not like dull faces.

325
00:29:28,627 --> 00:29:31,208
Well, it's better, much better.

326
00:29:34,136 --> 00:29:36,088
You will wait, will not you?

327
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:40,035
Maybe you can dispel the clouds.

328
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,867
We planned to meet here.
This is the same shelter.

329
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:48,541
Good very good.

330
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,628
The place where I
work perfectly.

331
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:02,550
Around the hills... the lake...
stairs leading to my apartment...

332
00:30:03,889 --> 00:30:05,303
That sounds good.

333
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:08,492
Yes, I know, but
I'm very lonely.

334
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,226
Did you live there?

335
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:14,629
No, but I know that I would lose
true friendly communication.

336
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:18,264
Although I did not live there yet.

337
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,135
Do not you like to be alone?

338
00:30:24,837 --> 00:30:26,152
Why do I need this, Monisha?

339
00:30:27,862 --> 00:30:29,177
I'm not a recluse.

340
00:30:29,999 --> 00:30:32,383
I am a normal human being.

341
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:42,485
Of course, if there was a choice

342
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:46,928
between continuous
company and loneliness, ..

343
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,514
, I would prefer solitude.

344
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:56,187
If I had Somebody, like you...

345
00:30:57,277 --> 00:30:58,277
Thank you.

346
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,701
You like being
formal, are not you?

347
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,494
I like?

348
00:31:14,966 --> 00:31:15,966
No!

349
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,043
You behave yourself...

350
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,089
You can write a book
about etiquette.

351
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:27,552
I can do it.
You can be formal too.

352
00:31:27,884 --> 00:31:28,884
I!

353
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:33,016
It does not take long to start
addressing you in a less dry tone.

354
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:37,186
It's because you
lived in England.

355
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,611
"You" has only one form there.

356
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:50,241
If we are talking about
England, let me add...

357
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:53,535
You know...

358
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:57,792
that there men and women meet freely.
They have the opportunity...

359
00:31:58,701 --> 00:32:02,420
and social permission.

360
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,340
- Yes I know.
- You know!

361
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:10,178
It's good that you know.

362
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:16,558
I was quite close with
a few English girls.

363
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,439
I say this...

364
00:32:22,318 --> 00:32:24,080
not because I want to show,

365
00:32:24,579 --> 00:32:26,828
but because I do not want
to hide anything from you.

366
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:31,616
Now that I met you,
I understood...

367
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,834
those relationships
were so insignificant...

368
00:32:36,914 --> 00:32:39,973
so trivial...

369
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,585
Hey, kind man.

370
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:49,092
Where have you been?

371
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,640
Mr. Books... Mrs. Chowdhury.

372
00:32:56,312 --> 00:32:57,312
Thank you.

373
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,663
Do not see you in the club.

374
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,654
We've lost you.
Boring without you...

375
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,698
while playing bridge.

376
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,865
There was a new player.

377
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,743
He's from Calverstone,

378
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,745
but when he started to play...

379
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:27,271
How are you? Why are you alone?

380
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:31,426
I do not know anyone here.

381
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,596
Do you like Darjeeling?

382
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,115
I can not say anything yet.

383
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,019
You do not like mountains?

384
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:43,979
Love very much!

385
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,817
But I did not come here to rest.

386
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,007
Is someone sick in the family?

387
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:54,614
My mother.

388
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:58,035
I bear this burden.

389
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,580
What with her?

390
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:05,042
Chronic malaria.
She has been suffering for many years.

391
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,295
And the other symptoms.

392
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,016
How are you?

393
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,163
"His mother's uncle..."
No, on the father.

394
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:22,691
His uncle was my
brother's tutor.

395
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:24,399
Well yes.

396
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:29,400
He guessed that English
was my profiling subject.

397
00:34:30,801 --> 00:34:32,651
Oh, Sherlock Holmes!

398
00:34:34,984 --> 00:34:35,984
Light a cigarette?

399
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,325
Oh please!

400
00:34:42,891 --> 00:34:44,222
Well, what about Calcutta?

401
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,130
Well, enough!

402
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,028
The last picture, please.

403
00:34:56,485 --> 00:34:58,096
No, I refuse.

404
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,937
- Are you leaving?
- I'm late.

405
00:35:12,759 --> 00:35:14,560
- And your phone number.
- Oh yeah.

406
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,489
Can I call?

407
00:35:17,009 --> 00:35:18,439
Yes goodbye.

408
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,620
Lily

409
00:35:21,145 --> 00:35:22,145
Lily

410
00:35:23,541 --> 00:35:25,862
Lily, I'll do anything
for you, anything.

411
00:35:25,863 --> 00:35:28,986
Thank you bye.

412
00:35:37,884 --> 00:35:38,884
Hey, score!

413
00:36:07,072 --> 00:36:13,072
Here is a witch.

414
00:36:35,549 --> 00:36:37,226
A lovely little dog!

415
00:36:39,215 --> 00:36:40,793
Can I take a picture?

416
00:36:41,483 --> 00:36:44,146
"To the dog?"
- Naturally.

417
00:36:44,343 --> 00:36:46,645
- You are welcome.
- Thank you.

418
00:36:56,441 --> 00:36:59,365
I would..., I..., perhaps you would
take it in your arms or on the table.

419
00:36:59,991 --> 00:37:04,380
Because I want to take a photo against
the background of the mountains.

420
00:37:04,758 --> 00:37:06,106
Oh yes of course!

421
00:37:21,705 --> 00:37:24,566
"Are you here for a long time?"
Oh yeah.

422
00:37:28,034 --> 00:37:29,908
Do you really like dogs?

423
00:37:30,335 --> 00:37:32,390
Yes.

424
00:37:36,697 --> 00:37:38,078
Good!

425
00:38:37,195 --> 00:38:38,664
Two - the company...

426
00:38:38,665 --> 00:38:40,665
No, three...

427
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,377
It is not noticeable that they are close.

428
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,409
Where did you come from?

429
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:54,910
Hey Hey.

430
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,261
What did you see today?

431
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:09,715
Today? All sorts of things... birds...

432
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,224
Have I met you before?

433
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,268
My name is Ashok Ray.

434
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,855
I'm Jagadish Chatterjee,
Her uncle.

435
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:20,708
With him I still have
no relationship...

436
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,611
Do not pay any attention
to my impudence.

437
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:25,403
Do me a favor...

438
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:30,159
Do not pay attention to me. You already
have someone to make a company for.

439
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,329
I feel more alone now.

440
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,208
- Are you interested in birds?
- Birds!

441
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,464
What kind of birds?

442
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,102
Birds in general.

443
00:40:00,542 --> 00:40:02,036
- He is pretty.
- Yes.

444
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,910
I was frightened of his uncle.

445
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,822
Once I left the doll on my brother's desk.
He got angry...

446
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:10,766
on my brother and
threw out the doll.

447
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,210
I meant your uncle.

448
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,212
Oh yes?

449
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,424
He is charming.

450
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:22,233
- Is he a widower?
- Yes.

451
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:26,027
"He's different from us."
- Why?

452
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:29,093
We have become largely
materialists.

453
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:34,014
Whatever we do, we should get
immediate benefit and benefit...

454
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,643
a noticeable result.

455
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:42,314
Enterprises, budgets,
calculations, revenues...

456
00:40:43,425 --> 00:40:46,666
We became pragmatic.

457
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,823
The flood somewhere
destroyed the harvest...

458
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:55,161
Now, let's build a dam,
regulate the flow of the river,

459
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:59,665
it requires materials,
equipment, labor...

460
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,170
I tired you?

461
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:09,258
No. Such as my
uncle, people need.

462
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,762
Certainly! Absolutely!
Maybe I need it, too.

463
00:41:14,374 --> 00:41:16,306
I think that we could
be very good friends.

464
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,267
We would complement each other.

465
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,312
Friendship could grow.

466
00:41:21,972 --> 00:41:22,972
How...

467
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,232
Sandeep and Nikilesh!

468
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,769
Have you read Home and Peace?

469
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:34,825
I mean the relationship
between husband and wife...

470
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:36,868
Rarely...

471
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:42,833
spouses are equally talented
and have common interests.

472
00:41:43,118 --> 00:41:44,118
Family of Browning?

473
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,591
What about Browning?

474
00:41:47,162 --> 00:41:50,072
Oh, the Browning is an exception.

475
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,667
Generally it happens that way...

476
00:41:57,917 --> 00:42:00,668
men have a certain profession.

477
00:42:00,837 --> 00:42:05,930
Doctors... politicians...
engineers... lawyers...

478
00:42:06,675 --> 00:42:09,528
But as for wives, how
many among them...

479
00:42:10,137 --> 00:42:12,956
know or understand the
work of their husband.

480
00:42:13,933 --> 00:42:18,229
Is it really that important?

481
00:42:19,647 --> 00:42:23,984
Take a talented woman who
paints or writes poems...

482
00:42:24,777 --> 00:42:29,114
If she marries a doctor, she
thinks that her life...

483
00:42:30,574 --> 00:42:32,142
will be destroyed.

484
00:42:37,604 --> 00:42:39,364
Monisha!

485
00:42:40,588 --> 00:42:43,584
How to predict that
this will not be so?

486
00:42:44,046 --> 00:42:46,799
Have you ever asked such
a woman how she feels?

487
00:42:48,903 --> 00:42:52,471
Monisha, you mean...

488
00:42:54,265 --> 00:42:56,767
if a woman wants to get married...

489
00:42:58,811 --> 00:43:03,232
she must evaluate
her own dignity and...

490
00:43:03,983 --> 00:43:07,486
compare them with the merits of
her husband to understand...

491
00:43:08,237 --> 00:43:10,489
- are they a couple?
- No.

492
00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:12,825
Clearly, no.
That would be stupid.

493
00:43:20,871 --> 00:43:23,252
Monisha! What would you say?

494
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:47,601
I do not know.

495
00:43:50,382 --> 00:43:52,140
You must know...

496
00:43:54,408 --> 00:43:56,101
that it depends
on your attitude.

497
00:44:22,728 --> 00:44:24,896
- I think...
- What do you think?

498
00:44:25,648 --> 00:44:27,207
A foggy day.

499
00:44:29,735 --> 00:44:32,670
"I love the fog."
- I also.

500
00:44:33,725 --> 00:44:35,174
It is very good for health.

501
00:44:35,949 --> 00:44:38,101
- Mr. Banerjee...
- Yes?

502
00:44:38,285 --> 00:44:41,705
Why do not we go for a
walk and not talk at all?

503
00:44:43,256 --> 00:44:44,704
Please, as you wish.

504
00:44:51,432 --> 00:44:54,501
In 1954, after the death of my wife,

505
00:44:56,387 --> 00:44:58,931
I traveled to the West.

506
00:45:00,391 --> 00:45:03,394
After a month of
aimless wandering...

507
00:45:04,687 --> 00:45:09,108
I reached Rishikesh,
where I met a man.

508
00:45:09,942 --> 00:45:14,279
The birds were his passion.
And I inherited it.

509
00:45:15,906 --> 00:45:18,000
He had a strange theory.

510
00:45:18,617 --> 00:45:21,244
He believed that
Ragi had happened...

511
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:23,630
from the singing of birds.

512
00:45:24,123 --> 00:45:27,673
He illustrated his
theory with examples.

513
00:45:30,379 --> 00:45:32,948
I also love music.

514
00:45:33,132 --> 00:45:36,718
His theory impressed me greatly.
I found it intriguing.

515
00:45:37,636 --> 00:45:42,279
These birds... are
migratory birds.

516
00:45:42,349 --> 00:45:44,125
Are not they adorable?

517
00:45:44,476 --> 00:45:48,970
Only worthy of admiration?
This is one of the deep secrets of nature.

518
00:45:49,648 --> 00:45:52,067
Every year, at the city
zoo, I heard that...

519
00:45:52,434 --> 00:45:54,486
certain kinds of birds...

520
00:45:54,712 --> 00:45:56,530
- Sharal!
- Sharal. It's in Hindi.

521
00:45:57,865 --> 00:46:00,117
In English "Lesser wistling
teal" (Small Teal)

522
00:46:00,868 --> 00:46:06,081
It migrates locally.
But there is another kind...

523
00:46:06,082 --> 00:46:10,015
It's called... golden plover.

524
00:46:10,294 --> 00:46:11,419
It's amazing!

525
00:46:11,587 --> 00:46:16,383
They fly from the Arctic
directly to the tropics.

526
00:46:17,069 --> 00:46:19,897
They fly 3200 km.

527
00:46:21,013 --> 00:46:24,141
They build their nests
in special places.

528
00:46:25,392 --> 00:46:28,937
Every year, without exception,
as a phenomenon of nature.

529
00:46:29,855 --> 00:46:33,609
They have such a fragile body,
and such a small brain.

530
00:46:34,443 --> 00:46:37,604
How can they perform
such a feat?

531
00:46:37,946 --> 00:46:41,074
No one has found the
answer to this mystery.

532
00:46:41,533 --> 00:46:42,951
In fact, it's amazing.

533
00:46:46,914 --> 00:46:48,332
I'm afraid of one thing.

534
00:46:49,416 --> 00:46:51,543
You can laugh at me.

535
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:57,378
I lie at night on the
bed and think...

536
00:46:59,635 --> 00:47:04,056
All these nuclear tests...

537
00:47:05,557 --> 00:47:09,978
fill the atmosphere with
poisonous radioactive gases.

538
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:15,067
One day it will turn out that
the birds have not arrived.

539
00:47:17,152 --> 00:47:21,031
They lost their reason
and forgot their way.

540
00:47:21,949 --> 00:47:25,202
They lost their minds and lost
their special feelings...

541
00:47:25,203 --> 00:47:26,503
navigation.

542
00:47:30,824 --> 00:47:33,510
Or maybe they all died on the road.

543
00:47:33,836 --> 00:47:37,722
And like drops of rain
fell one after another.

544
00:47:45,264 --> 00:47:46,389
That's her?

545
00:49:22,434 --> 00:49:24,001
Should I leave?

546
00:49:26,856 --> 00:49:30,969
No, I want to talk to you.

547
00:49:39,517 --> 00:49:42,710
Marriage is a noble institution.

548
00:49:42,881 --> 00:49:44,432
What do you want to say?

549
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:47,739
I think.

550
00:49:50,468 --> 00:49:52,177
I think out loud.

551
00:49:57,562 --> 00:50:02,651
The daughter of a rich man
married a suitable person.

552
00:50:03,318 --> 00:50:05,862
And God blessed them.

553
00:50:07,554 --> 00:50:09,534
There were ads in the newspapers.

554
00:50:11,243 --> 00:50:15,497
And within 10 years, the marriage
rotted to the very root.

555
00:50:18,375 --> 00:50:20,168
Should this have happened?

556
00:50:22,754 --> 00:50:25,916
Who is guilty?
Who should answer?

557
00:50:26,007 --> 00:50:28,660
Should not we consider
these issues?

558
00:50:30,178 --> 00:50:31,871
It's time to do it.

559
00:50:32,294 --> 00:50:36,009
This is the right moment.
This is the right place.

560
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:39,771
The walls have ears, but
there is no mountain.

561
00:50:44,359 --> 00:50:46,019
You must answer.

562
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:50,028
Stupidity.

563
00:50:50,201 --> 00:50:52,955
Trust... credulity...

564
00:50:53,243 --> 00:50:57,180
If this is the fault,
then I am to blame.

565
00:50:59,666 --> 00:51:00,875
What?

566
00:51:02,878 --> 00:51:04,796
The fact that you had a hobby...

567
00:51:06,298 --> 00:51:11,136
even before marriage.
And what do you continue...

568
00:51:11,803 --> 00:51:17,721
I should have known? I'm a fool.
And you're a great actress.

569
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:41,249
If I even lose my money
in speculation...

570
00:51:42,201 --> 00:51:44,394
we will not starve...

571
00:51:45,087 --> 00:51:49,132
because you will play in
films and support me.

572
00:51:54,971 --> 00:51:57,224
Have you read his letters?

573
00:51:59,878 --> 00:52:01,741
How bad it all is.

574
00:52:04,856 --> 00:52:06,599
You should...

575
00:52:06,942 --> 00:52:09,977
I know you read them.

576
00:52:10,739 --> 00:52:14,449
Well well well...
How will you punish me?

577
00:52:16,451 --> 00:52:17,994
I guessed many things.

578
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:29,256
Why are you crying?
I do not blame you.

579
00:52:33,051 --> 00:52:36,638
How can I?
What did I get from you?

580
00:52:37,848 --> 00:52:39,474
I endured so much.

581
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:44,604
It was a mistake. You could
not talk about this?

582
00:52:45,522 --> 00:52:48,441
And would you change?

583
00:52:49,734 --> 00:52:54,865
Would he stop playing, would
he leave all his habits?

584
00:52:57,576 --> 00:53:01,802
Well, if not completely,
then some of them.

585
00:53:04,082 --> 00:53:05,483
Family inheritance.

586
00:53:07,043 --> 00:53:09,129
It is wrong to reject everything.

587
00:53:28,148 --> 00:53:29,949
What did you find in it?

588
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:32,635
At least I have an education.

589
00:53:32,819 --> 00:53:34,304
He's a clown!

590
00:53:38,533 --> 00:53:40,660
Is this all so serious?

591
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:45,415
He really loves me.

592
00:53:47,731 --> 00:53:49,023
And you?

593
00:53:51,171 --> 00:53:52,588
I love him too.

594
00:54:02,015 --> 00:54:04,059
Have you lost your sanity?

595
00:54:04,893 --> 00:54:07,229
These things are beyond
the control of reason.

596
00:54:12,317 --> 00:54:16,135
Why did you marry me?

597
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:22,009
You know why. No one can contradict
the wishes of the father.

598
00:54:22,044 --> 00:54:27,587
Why did you play a farce, supposedly
you were in love with me?

599
00:54:28,792 --> 00:54:32,754
I already told him
after my marriage...

600
00:54:34,089 --> 00:54:35,265
Good?

601
00:54:36,007 --> 00:54:40,470
I did not know the
person for whom I left.

602
00:54:42,013 --> 00:54:45,700
How could I love him?
It was made of stone.

603
00:54:47,644 --> 00:54:50,689
I turned into stone when
I learned the truth.

604
00:54:54,445 --> 00:54:55,445
Mama!

605
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:02,860
Mama!

606
00:55:03,493 --> 00:55:04,702
Yes darling.

607
00:55:11,156 --> 00:55:12,465
Dad!

608
00:56:50,683 --> 00:56:52,018
Grandmother!

609
00:56:55,146 --> 00:56:57,231
4 circles, I'll go!

610
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,681
4 circles, and one more circle!

611
00:57:23,419 --> 00:57:25,020
Young man!

612
00:57:25,021 --> 00:57:27,354
Come here, come here!

613
00:57:29,095 --> 00:57:31,331
I tell you, you!

614
00:57:42,026 --> 00:57:43,761
Were you frightened?

615
00:57:51,661 --> 00:57:55,081
Why did you get scared of me?
Am I biting you?

616
00:58:05,091 --> 00:58:07,417
- Your height?
- My height?

617
00:58:07,802 --> 00:58:10,221
Well, yes, otherwise I would ask
the height of Mount Everest?

618
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,399
I did not measure.

619
00:58:13,474 --> 00:58:17,512
When was the last time you measured it?
It is unlikely that you have grown up yet.

620
00:58:17,745 --> 00:58:18,967
175 centimeters.

621
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:22,442
How old are you?
- 24.

622
00:58:24,986 --> 00:58:27,371
"Do you play cricket?"
It happens.

623
00:58:29,041 --> 00:58:30,758
How are your walks in the mountains?

624
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:34,537
When you climb a mountain,
does not intercept breathing?

625
00:58:35,163 --> 00:58:36,706
Yes, I do not seem to.

626
00:58:39,964 --> 00:58:42,503
Take it.
The key of room number 7.

627
00:58:42,921 --> 00:58:46,049
Climb to my room and
bring my red scarf.

628
00:58:46,674 --> 00:58:50,511
Wait! Do you know which
hotel I was staying at?

629
00:58:52,101 --> 00:58:55,225
I'm not sure.
"Go straight on this road."

630
00:58:58,436 --> 00:59:01,439
You will find only one
red knitted scarf.

631
00:59:03,399 --> 00:59:05,944
I should not catch a
cold on the last day.

632
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:22,208
Monisha...

633
00:59:23,182 --> 00:59:26,228
Do you like me?

634
00:59:27,138 --> 00:59:28,799
Yes.

635
00:59:29,855 --> 00:59:32,889
Why not? I like you so much.

636
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,500
Monisha.

637
00:59:35,501 --> 00:59:40,186
Perhaps you do not know
much about my career.

638
00:59:42,355 --> 00:59:45,525
I feel uncomfortable
talking about myself.

639
00:59:46,383 --> 00:59:50,561
They say that I have
a brilliant future.

640
00:59:50,902 --> 00:59:52,915
- To Glasgow.
- I know.

641
00:59:53,866 --> 00:59:58,663
And besides...
I think you are a very good person.

642
01:00:00,290 --> 01:00:02,366
And very honest.

643
01:00:06,087 --> 01:00:07,964
You have a good heart and...

644
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:12,602
Yes, Monisha.

645
01:00:15,597 --> 01:00:20,101
What other qualities
should a man have to...

646
01:00:22,937 --> 01:00:27,483
Nothing more. I think
that there is enough.

647
01:00:39,287 --> 01:00:41,013
What are you doing here?

648
01:00:43,166 --> 01:00:44,742
Everything is fine?

649
01:00:46,043 --> 01:00:48,099
Come on, Tutsi.

650
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:57,505
Our father is waiting for us.

651
01:02:02,937 --> 01:02:05,041
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

652
01:02:11,137 --> 01:02:12,727
Thank you.

653
01:02:13,785 --> 01:02:15,472
Help me a young man.

654
01:02:17,376 --> 01:02:18,874
Hold it...

655
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:27,478
A somewhat underestimated gift
of the British for our country.

656
01:02:28,354 --> 01:02:30,264
Are you with them?

657
01:02:30,521 --> 01:02:32,954
I believe that no, I believe that no.

658
01:02:36,446 --> 01:02:40,450
Do you know who built
this big city?

659
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:43,536
So, many such as you come
here to breathe the air.

660
01:02:45,413 --> 01:02:48,157
Once it was a village
of the Lepcha tribe.

661
01:02:51,836 --> 01:02:53,421
Do you know who built this?

662
01:02:54,817 --> 01:02:56,691
One man good luck.

663
01:02:57,661 --> 01:02:59,387
British.

664
01:02:59,962 --> 01:03:01,507
Doctor Campbell.

665
01:03:40,092 --> 01:03:41,418
Want to ride?

666
01:04:27,265 --> 01:04:31,185
I've never played football.
It breaks my sense of beauty.

667
01:04:31,186 --> 01:04:33,027
Too noisy.

668
01:04:33,104 --> 01:04:36,816
And especially in the rain.
But look at cricket.

669
01:04:38,067 --> 01:04:40,611
He has a character, elegance, brilliance.

670
01:04:41,279 --> 01:04:43,155
I loved, I played cricket.

671
01:04:44,365 --> 01:04:46,450
I played well.

672
01:04:47,702 --> 01:04:50,496
Once I took almost a hundred points...

673
01:04:51,497 --> 01:04:53,065
in a friendly match.

674
01:04:54,333 --> 01:04:56,302
Griggs was a bowler.

675
01:04:57,295 --> 01:04:59,839
The filing with the trick
was still a rarity.

676
01:05:00,214 --> 01:05:03,574
We knew only twisted with a rebound to the
left and with a rebound to the right, etc.

677
01:05:04,302 --> 01:05:06,512
Griggs served twisted
with a right rebound.

678
01:05:08,848 --> 01:05:12,018
I got fours and sixs
with other bowlers.

679
01:05:13,311 --> 01:05:15,054
But I could not cope with Griggs.

680
01:05:15,396 --> 01:05:19,066
Within 20 minutes my
account reached 96.

681
01:05:19,692 --> 01:05:24,155
Griggs was supposed to
serve the third ball...

682
01:05:25,489 --> 01:05:28,701
he approached me and whispered:

683
01:05:29,014 --> 01:05:32,499
"I'm hurting you now."

684
01:05:32,663 --> 01:05:35,885
Keep this in mind when you beat.

685
01:05:36,584 --> 01:05:38,586
He kept his word.

686
01:05:39,045 --> 01:05:42,423
It was an easy ball, but
where were the boundaries?

687
01:05:42,757 --> 01:05:47,345
My nerves passed, and
my legs also passed.

688
01:05:50,473 --> 01:05:53,851
We could never perceive anything
in a sporting spirit, even a game.

689
01:05:54,226 --> 01:05:58,105
For us, Bengali people are
all things of life or death.

690
01:05:59,357 --> 01:06:00,942
But the attitude...

691
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:04,779
which, the people show to the
game, shows its caliber.

692
01:06:11,535 --> 01:06:13,537
We do not have a sporting spirit.

693
01:06:14,413 --> 01:06:17,583
They had them, so
they were not petty.

694
01:06:17,917 --> 01:06:20,461
They recognized good moments
in the game, if they saw any.

695
01:06:21,796 --> 01:06:24,590
Now such people are not enough.

696
01:06:26,217 --> 01:06:29,470
Do not you think that you
need to find a job yourself?

697
01:06:31,389 --> 01:06:35,851
You seek help, because you
can not help yourself.

698
01:06:38,562 --> 01:06:41,440
It's natural that an
influential person...

699
01:06:41,857 --> 01:06:43,526
can provide work for you.

700
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:48,072
If you recommend an
unworthy person...

701
01:06:48,656 --> 01:06:50,199
his family will prosper.

702
01:06:52,451 --> 01:06:55,913
But the whole department can fall apart.

703
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:58,007
What is your opinion?

704
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:01,966
You are on the threshold of your career.

705
01:07:02,128 --> 01:07:04,672
You must understand these things.

706
01:07:05,589 --> 01:07:08,509
It is easy to organize
alliances, to strike.

707
01:07:08,759 --> 01:07:12,013
Pronounce ferocious
speeches at the monuments.

708
01:07:12,346 --> 01:07:16,809
But in the process, people
lose the desire to work...

709
01:07:19,437 --> 01:07:23,232
In our times there was a "hobby"
terrorize the British.

710
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:26,426
Destructive whim.

711
01:07:30,281 --> 01:07:34,118
For example, take
my school friends.

712
01:07:36,037 --> 01:07:37,913
One was killed.

713
01:07:38,831 --> 01:07:42,001
Two others rotted in prison
on the Andaman Islands.

714
01:07:43,669 --> 01:07:45,629
If I joined this gang...

715
01:07:46,297 --> 01:07:50,092
I would not be here, and
I would not talk to you.

716
01:07:51,427 --> 01:07:53,078
In my opinion...

717
01:07:53,122 --> 01:07:54,919
I lived...

718
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:59,829
and because I lived, I
was useful to my country.

719
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,790
If it is necessary,
I can also add...

720
01:08:04,856 --> 01:08:06,631
I lived...

721
01:08:06,763 --> 01:08:10,077
to enjoy the fruits
of independence.

722
01:08:11,197 --> 01:08:14,700
To understand the fruit
is mature or green...

723
01:08:15,701 --> 01:08:18,944
I have never had the
inclination or the time...

724
01:08:20,058 --> 01:08:23,325
I'm sixty. I'm too
old to understand...

725
01:08:23,626 --> 01:08:25,961
how did she benefit us?

726
01:08:26,295 --> 01:08:29,757
This young generation
needs to be understood.

727
01:08:31,050 --> 01:08:32,309
I exist!

728
01:08:33,103 --> 01:08:36,431
I live..., I exist ..

729
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:38,009
Here.

730
01:08:40,726 --> 01:08:42,019
And I have a title...

731
01:08:43,896 --> 01:08:47,316
which was assigned to
me by our former rulers.

732
01:08:48,885 --> 01:08:50,200
I'm rich...

733
01:08:51,173 --> 01:08:52,435
and I'm proud of it.

734
01:09:06,877 --> 01:09:09,044
Can you find a job here?

735
01:09:10,756 --> 01:09:13,551
Come to me in Calcutta.

736
01:09:15,511 --> 01:09:17,392
But if you want to
enter my house...

737
01:09:18,013 --> 01:09:20,599
Your uncle must
notify in advance...

738
01:09:21,016 --> 01:09:22,852
To arrive on time.

739
01:09:26,063 --> 01:09:27,356
How many do you need?

740
01:09:28,941 --> 01:09:29,941
200?

741
01:09:31,314 --> 01:09:32,314
300?

742
01:09:36,949 --> 01:09:40,121
How many? "How much do I need?"

743
01:09:45,382 --> 01:09:46,549
Damn it!

744
01:09:51,714 --> 01:09:54,508
- Are you unemployed?
- No.

745
01:09:55,169 --> 01:09:57,174
No?

746
01:09:59,430 --> 01:10:00,431
What do you do?

747
01:10:02,016 --> 01:10:05,144
- I give private lessons.
- Private lessons.

748
01:10:07,688 --> 01:10:10,983
- Well, how much can you earn?
- 50 rupees.

749
01:10:11,462 --> 01:10:13,389
Rs 50 per month!

750
01:10:16,697 --> 01:10:21,118
- Do you need a job?
- Yes.

751
01:10:22,992 --> 01:10:24,922
Well, how do you hope to get it?

752
01:10:27,864 --> 01:10:30,735
Well, how do you
hope to get it?!

753
01:10:34,141 --> 01:10:35,141
How?!

754
01:10:36,091 --> 01:10:37,258
Own efforts.

755
01:11:45,619 --> 01:11:46,662
I want to tell you...

756
01:11:47,871 --> 01:11:51,041
If you have any other
sources of funds...

757
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:52,500
you can leave.

758
01:12:00,384 --> 01:12:04,221
If this person is responsible,
If he takes you in marriage.

759
01:12:06,765 --> 01:12:08,350
It's up to you.

760
01:12:08,976 --> 01:12:11,187
I do not hold you.

761
01:12:11,188 --> 01:12:12,188
What will happen to me?

762
01:12:13,814 --> 01:12:14,814
I'm right.

763
01:12:15,733 --> 01:12:18,318
I see nothing but
misfortune in this.

764
01:12:25,325 --> 01:12:29,830
If I forget it and finish it all...

765
01:12:35,210 --> 01:12:38,213
This is too big a sacrifice.

766
01:12:42,176 --> 01:12:44,569
"It's not a sacrifice."
"Then what?"

767
01:12:47,723 --> 01:12:51,143
Believe me, this fascination
will not bring me happiness.

768
01:12:52,853 --> 01:12:56,982
Now it's just a habit.
I asked him not to write.

769
01:12:57,483 --> 01:13:00,110
But he does not listen.

770
01:13:00,527 --> 01:13:02,738
It really does not matter.

771
01:13:03,113 --> 01:13:05,807
This is something that has
no end, and has no apogee.

772
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:10,788
There must be an apogee.

773
01:13:12,706 --> 01:13:16,168
If I give you a divorce,
you can do as you want.

774
01:13:17,169 --> 01:13:18,796
You can start a new home.

775
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:23,592
Such things happen now.

776
01:13:26,804 --> 01:13:29,348
There is no need
for mutual claims.

777
01:13:31,266 --> 01:13:35,354
- Only a business arrangement.
- I do not want it.

778
01:13:35,979 --> 01:13:38,273
Are you scared of the scandal?

779
01:13:41,735 --> 01:13:45,447
No.
"Are you afraid of your father?"

780
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:49,451
In the end, when ever, the
father will find out about it..

781
01:13:50,410 --> 01:13:52,996
Monisha knows.
Mother, too, maybe.

782
01:13:54,289 --> 01:13:58,641
"What are you afraid of?"
"It's not fear."

783
01:13:59,002 --> 01:14:01,964
- This is regret.
- About what?

784
01:14:03,257 --> 01:14:07,803
There is someone for
whom I am very worried.

785
01:14:08,345 --> 01:14:10,264
What will happen to her?

786
01:14:10,931 --> 01:14:12,516
She did not do anything wrong.

787
01:14:14,045 --> 01:14:19,273
Whether it is exact? She believed
her parents so recklessly.

788
01:14:21,191 --> 01:14:25,320
She loved us so much.
Also what, it is "bad"?

789
01:14:28,277 --> 01:14:36,277
<i>Children's song.</i>

790
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:03,275
<i>I do not belong to
this world of exile.</i>

791
01:15:12,284 --> 01:15:16,663
<i>No one can bear
such a burden of doubt.</i>

792
01:15:18,790 --> 01:15:22,069
<i>This unceasing
torment, this sadness.</i>

793
01:15:51,406 --> 01:15:55,202
<i>In this foreign land,
who will support me?</i>

794
01:15:56,119 --> 01:15:59,081
<i>Who will protect me from pain,
from fear, from anguish.</i>

795
01:16:34,825 --> 01:16:38,745
<i>There is no one who
can reach my heart.</i>

796
01:16:41,957 --> 01:16:45,961
<i>In this vast wild desert, I am alone.</i>

797
01:17:12,696 --> 01:17:13,696
Brother!

798
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:26,001
You have not sung for a long time.

799
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:33,300
Where is everyone?

800
01:17:35,802 --> 01:17:37,638
Somewhere here, nearby.

801
01:17:44,853 --> 01:17:46,060
Where is Monisha?

802
01:17:46,647 --> 01:17:48,649
Where would you like her to be?

803
01:17:49,608 --> 01:17:50,817
I don't know.

804
01:17:51,777 --> 01:17:52,819
You do not know?

805
01:17:56,570 --> 01:17:57,570
No.

806
01:17:59,284 --> 01:18:00,284
I'm afraid.

807
01:18:00,885 --> 01:18:02,802
What are you afraid of?

808
01:18:06,333 --> 01:18:09,344
What's the matter? Your daughter is lovely.
She's also good.

809
01:18:11,588 --> 01:18:14,800
- I know it all.
- So what?

810
01:18:19,221 --> 01:18:23,141
She has many internal virtues.
What if they are depressed?

811
01:18:26,019 --> 01:18:29,189
- When I did not hear your voice...
- Listen!

812
01:18:30,857 --> 01:18:31,858
What?

813
01:18:32,734 --> 01:18:34,820
Monish should say something.

814
01:18:35,445 --> 01:18:36,831
Right now?

815
01:18:37,948 --> 01:18:38,990
Yes, right now.

816
01:18:39,991 --> 01:18:41,362
Where are you going?

817
01:18:41,952 --> 01:18:44,871
Otherwise, there may be too late.
"Where did you see her?"

818
01:18:46,957 --> 01:18:49,418
"May I pass on your message?"
Yes.

819
01:18:50,961 --> 01:18:54,965
"What should I say to her?"
"Tell me what I want..."

820
01:18:57,008 --> 01:18:58,885
That she did as she
was better for her.

821
01:19:00,137 --> 01:19:02,764
She has no obligations.

822
01:19:04,164 --> 01:19:05,184
His Grace?

823
01:19:06,101 --> 01:19:09,187
I will meet with him.
If you need it, I'll beat it.

824
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:13,066
Why reconcile with life
full of submission?

825
01:19:39,454 --> 01:19:43,722
Why are you alone?

826
01:19:45,891 --> 01:19:47,100
He left?

827
01:19:48,268 --> 01:19:50,228
I did not think he would
let you go so easily.

828
01:19:51,563 --> 01:19:54,941
"He's a real man!"
"Did you speak with your father?"

829
01:20:00,363 --> 01:20:03,575
Are you very worried
that I will find a job?

830
01:20:04,539 --> 01:20:05,539
Miss Monica.

831
01:20:05,788 --> 01:20:07,370
- No.
- Good?

832
01:20:09,498 --> 01:20:11,958
"Maybe I'm curious." Yes it is.

833
01:20:13,251 --> 01:20:16,421
It's not entirely convenient that
you are worried about such things.

834
01:20:17,672 --> 01:20:20,217
"You have other problems."
Well, for example?

835
01:20:20,926 --> 01:20:25,305
Problems of clothing, etiquette:

836
01:20:26,056 --> 01:20:29,768
Which sari to wear... what
shoes are better suited...,

837
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:33,146
When to say "I'm sorry",
When to say "Thank you".

838
01:20:33,772 --> 01:20:35,524
What kind of forks and knives are used...

839
01:20:36,858 --> 01:20:38,652
Why are you talking like this?

840
01:20:39,402 --> 01:20:42,030
I just asked if you were
talking with your father.

841
01:20:42,823 --> 01:20:45,200
It's only because
it's about my father.

842
01:20:46,535 --> 01:20:47,828
I have no other interest.

843
01:20:54,268 --> 01:20:56,442
Sorry, sorry, please.

844
01:20:58,713 --> 01:21:01,132
I knew that you could not
have any other interest.

845
01:21:01,883 --> 01:21:03,301
Naturally.

846
01:21:05,637 --> 01:21:09,391
When you asked about my
mother, I realized that...

847
01:21:10,225 --> 01:21:13,270
you did not have a real interest.

848
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:15,814
You did it out of courtesy.

849
01:21:16,523 --> 01:21:19,150
- It is not good to be polite?
- No.

850
01:21:21,695 --> 01:21:26,074
In fact, I was very excited
since the morning.

851
01:21:27,742 --> 01:21:30,236
Besides, I never had the
opportunity to meet...

852
01:21:32,038 --> 01:21:33,290
A girl like you.

853
01:21:34,541 --> 01:21:38,420
I always cherished the hope, if
I ever meet a girl like you...

854
01:21:39,004 --> 01:21:40,004
I'll tell her that.

855
01:21:40,630 --> 01:21:44,050
"What do you mean, like me?"
Your class.

856
01:21:44,843 --> 01:21:49,347
"What class am I in?"
To the class with money.

857
01:21:50,056 --> 01:21:54,227
To those who have houses, cars.
Who does not need to make a living.

858
01:21:54,519 --> 01:21:58,189
To those who have signs on their
gates, "Be careful, angry dogs."

859
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:05,780
And that, everyone belonging
to my class, bad people?

860
01:22:06,573 --> 01:22:08,319
Not necessary. "Then what?"

861
01:22:08,439 --> 01:22:09,790
I said "I'm sorry."

862
01:22:10,744 --> 01:22:14,831
For example, your uncle.
I really liked him.

863
01:22:18,710 --> 01:22:23,048
We did not have the opportunity
to get to know each other better.

864
01:22:23,882 --> 01:22:27,660
And there will not be, probably. But if it
was, perhaps we would come to a conclusion...

865
01:22:28,345 --> 01:22:31,264
that we are both good people.

866
01:22:32,588 --> 01:22:33,588
Thank you.

867
01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:52,160
Do you want to know
about my work?

868
01:22:54,371 --> 01:22:55,747
I did not mean to say that.

869
01:22:57,082 --> 01:22:59,584
You must already think
I'm an eccentric.

870
01:23:01,586 --> 01:23:03,421
You think I'm weird.

871
01:23:04,172 --> 01:23:05,172
Why?

872
01:23:09,970 --> 01:23:12,639
Has anyone manifested
disobedience to your father?

873
01:23:13,682 --> 01:23:14,982
And you?

874
01:23:17,644 --> 01:23:18,895
Not certainly in that way.

875
01:23:20,146 --> 01:23:23,358
He already almost
offered me a job.

876
01:23:24,067 --> 01:23:25,276
I refused.

877
01:23:27,946 --> 01:23:29,906
You can act according
to your desires.

878
01:23:31,032 --> 01:23:32,409
Exactly!

879
01:23:33,034 --> 01:23:36,162
It was my desire, and I
did not accept the offer.

880
01:23:37,372 --> 01:23:39,666
But now I'm a little sorry.

881
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:43,795
Again write these statements,
pass interviews...,

882
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:46,548
in borrowed trousers.

883
01:23:51,553 --> 01:23:53,263
Perhaps I should have
accepted the offer.

884
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:58,435
The salary is 300 rupees!
I do not know what came over me.

885
01:24:00,437 --> 01:24:01,677
Maybe this place is to blame...

886
01:24:02,230 --> 01:24:04,357
In Calcutta, I would agree.

887
01:24:05,567 --> 01:24:08,046
Even if it meant charity.
But here...

888
01:24:09,821 --> 01:24:11,406
I've never seen such a landscape.

889
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:17,537
The Magic Himalayas.
These silent cedars...

890
01:24:19,330 --> 01:24:22,125
This sudden sun, sudden
clouds, sudden fog.

891
01:24:22,959 --> 01:24:25,503
It is so unreal, as in
a fairy-tale world.

892
01:24:26,171 --> 01:24:29,924
My head was like a whirlpool,
everything changed inside.

893
01:24:31,217 --> 01:24:33,428
As if I was some kind of...

894
01:24:34,012 --> 01:24:37,390
The hero! Giant!
I was full of courage.

895
01:24:37,932 --> 01:24:39,267
I was undaunted, unbending.

896
01:24:42,145 --> 01:24:46,608
Tell me, what other place fills
with such force, is not it?

897
01:24:51,071 --> 01:24:52,678
Finding a job is so easy!

898
01:24:53,531 --> 01:24:55,492
To hell! Let me go the same way.

899
01:24:56,826 --> 01:24:58,703
Come what may! Let me fight.

900
01:24:59,513 --> 01:25:01,009
No charity!

901
01:25:01,247 --> 01:25:03,401
Well, let him be the
president of five companies.

902
01:25:09,047 --> 01:25:10,924
Oh my God, what a shame!

903
01:25:13,551 --> 01:25:14,977
Please forgive me.

904
01:25:17,263 --> 01:25:18,807
In fact, I'm very sorry.

905
01:25:21,267 --> 01:25:24,437
You're not at all like him.
Of course, he is a big bump,

906
01:25:24,938 --> 01:25:28,066
But we are a new generation.
People like him...

907
01:25:28,942 --> 01:25:29,984
Bye.

908
01:25:30,944 --> 01:25:31,945
No, listen to me.

909
01:26:03,309 --> 01:26:06,822
"I was looking for you."
I know it.

910
01:26:13,486 --> 01:26:17,365
You must have wanted
to tell me something.

911
01:26:21,119 --> 01:26:23,997
But there is one problem...

912
01:26:27,709 --> 01:26:29,502
Come on, I'll tell you first.

913
01:26:34,632 --> 01:26:38,511
I never rushed to marry.

914
01:26:39,846 --> 01:26:42,390
I thought about it
only when I saw you.

915
01:26:45,685 --> 01:26:49,814
Now I see that this is impossible
in the foreseeable future.

916
01:26:50,690 --> 01:26:53,193
So I will try to
forget about it now.

917
01:26:54,407 --> 01:26:57,177
In fact, I already did it ..

918
01:26:58,281 --> 01:26:59,657
What I want to say...

919
01:27:02,285 --> 01:27:06,748
Maybe this romantic environment
makes you think ..

920
01:27:07,220 --> 01:27:10,019
That love is the most
important thing in the world.

921
01:27:10,569 --> 01:27:13,963
But if you return to Calcutta
if ever you felt that...

922
01:27:14,756 --> 01:27:16,854
security is better than love,

923
01:27:17,550 --> 01:27:21,971
o love can come from the
desire for security, then...,

924
01:27:23,056 --> 01:27:24,685
then let me know.

925
01:27:25,019 --> 01:27:26,124
Good?

926
01:27:28,358 --> 01:27:29,358
And now?

927
01:27:30,313 --> 01:27:31,940
Now you are free.

928
01:27:35,074 --> 01:27:38,395
"Oh, Mr. Banerjee..."
- Bye.

929
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:03,340
Listen!

930
01:28:17,977 --> 01:28:19,374
What should we do now?

931
01:28:24,867 --> 01:28:27,161
Do you have these letters with you?

932
01:28:31,801 --> 01:28:32,801
Here?

933
01:28:35,712 --> 01:28:37,046
You saw them.

934
01:28:41,718 --> 01:28:42,718
Do you have them?

935
01:28:47,810 --> 01:28:48,810
Yes...

936
01:28:50,643 --> 01:28:52,895
Show them to me.

937
01:29:10,728 --> 01:29:11,728
"Here."

938
01:29:13,082 --> 01:29:15,251
Can you destroy them...

939
01:29:18,213 --> 01:29:19,273
with me?

940
01:29:48,076 --> 01:29:49,076
And you?

941
01:29:54,332 --> 01:29:58,439
I, too, must give
up many things.

942
01:29:58,836 --> 01:30:03,753
I will feel the same
pain you felt now.

943
01:30:05,259 --> 01:30:06,636
I understood...

944
01:30:16,687 --> 01:30:18,731
I can live without you. But...

945
01:30:32,995 --> 01:30:35,873
Ask your mom to go home with us.

946
01:31:38,396 --> 01:31:40,171
Give me the money, sir.

947
01:31:47,904 --> 01:31:49,906
Take it. You won.

948
01:31:56,958 --> 01:31:57,958
Lord!

949
01:32:03,211 --> 01:32:04,211
You are coming back?

950
01:32:05,782 --> 01:32:06,782
Yes.

951
01:32:09,146 --> 01:32:10,765
I'm cold.

952
01:32:19,858 --> 01:32:21,187
And you?

953
01:32:21,979 --> 01:32:25,274
I hope soon your
mother will be better.

954
01:32:26,297 --> 01:32:27,579
I hope so too.

955
01:32:31,738 --> 01:32:33,366
It's not just politeness.

956
01:32:35,928 --> 01:32:38,377
I see.

957
01:32:41,791 --> 01:32:43,876
Will you visit us in Calcutta?

958
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:48,543
No.

959
01:32:49,144 --> 01:32:50,144
Why not?

960
01:32:51,217 --> 01:32:52,843
They will not let me.

961
01:32:53,636 --> 01:32:54,720
Who told you?

962
01:32:56,013 --> 01:32:59,725
Your father said that I must
arrange a visit in advance.

963
01:33:02,895 --> 01:33:05,482
It is not necessary for my friends.

964
01:33:30,464 --> 01:33:31,464
They are looking for you.

965
01:33:33,426 --> 01:33:36,812
"Are not you coming?"
"Will you visit us?"

966
01:33:41,934 --> 01:33:42,934
Maybe.

967
01:33:46,022 --> 01:33:49,525
"We do not keep dogs."
"Then I will come."

968
01:33:54,030 --> 01:33:57,158
I was once bitten by
dogs of one Englishman.

969
01:33:58,153 --> 01:33:59,436
Since...

970
01:34:02,330 --> 01:34:03,664
My name is not Monica.

971
01:34:04,790 --> 01:34:05,790
Actually?

972
01:34:07,567 --> 01:34:08,702
Monisha.

973
01:34:10,713 --> 01:34:13,799
I'll memorise.

974
01:34:17,178 --> 01:34:18,679
We'll meet in Calcutta.

975
01:34:21,414 --> 01:34:22,414
Bye.

976
01:34:41,153 --> 01:34:42,427
Good day to you, sir.
