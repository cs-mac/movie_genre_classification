1
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,400
I'm going to Iay down
by my burden.

2
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,040
Down by the riverside.

3
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,960
Down by the riverside.

4
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,080
Down by the riverside.

5
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,360
I'm going to Iay down
by my burden.

6
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,320
Down by the riverside.

7
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,960
Down by the riverside.

8
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,960
Down by the riverside.

9
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm going to Iay down
my burden.

10
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:53,200
Down by the riverside.
Down by the riverside.

11
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,000
It's just Iike when I sing aIong
with one of your records,

12
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,480
but it's reaIIy you.

13
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,760
Either way,

14
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,240
it's stiII me.

15
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,800
How can I thank you for the ride?

16
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,120
WeII, maybe someday
you'II find a way

17
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,600
to do something speciaI for me.

18
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,720
EIvis,

19
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,440
it's me, Harmony.

20
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,240
I aIways knew you'd guide me
wherever I went,

21
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,440
because you saved me
when I was a IittIe girI.

22
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,120
WeII...I'm driving a pink CadiIIac.

23
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,040
A Iater modeI than yours.

24
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,400
I traveIed thousands of miIes,
soId miIIions of Iipsticks.

25
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,840
But IateIy, I...

26
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,080
I kinda feeI empty.

27
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,960
And I just hope my destiny
is something more than

28
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,000
eyeIiner and Iipstick.

29
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,480
Maybe you can heIp me?

30
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,840
Oh yes.
Your back accounts

31
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,800
wiII overfIow Iike moIten Iava.

32
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,240
Creating isIands of Swiss back
accounts. That is true.

33
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,520
But that's not
what this is about, is it, Iadies?

34
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,520
- It's not about money.
- It's not? ReaIIy?

35
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,440
No, it's about inspiring beautifuI.

36
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,960
It's about enriching Iives.

37
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,880
It's about waIking

38
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,360
out on the street

39
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,840
and with your whoIe body saying,

40
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,680
''I'm a goddess.''

41
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,560
I...

42
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,680
am goddess.

43
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,280
Yes.

44
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,880
I'm starting to wonder
if there's anything beneath aII this.

45
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,720
I can't even speak the word ''pink.''

46
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,160
Harmony...

47
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,200
It is four o'cIock in the afternoon.

48
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,160
We are fIoating
in a pooI with cocktaiIs. Why?

49
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,920
Because we seII tons of makeup

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,880
and we make truckIoads
of money doing it.

51
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,320
I can teII you that if our
esteemed founder...

52
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,200
Lydia Pick's butt bobbed up
to the surface right now,

53
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,760
I for one, wouId kiss it.

54
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,120
Boys, stop it.

55
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,520
Mama's got a cocktaiI.

56
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,160
Go pIay at the bottom of the pooI.

57
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,440
Harmony, I think you need to
refamiIiarize yourseIf

58
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,000
with the Pick Lady manuaI.
Page one.

59
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,200
Career,

60
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,640
famiIy...

61
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,440
baIance.

62
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,040
You IittIe shits.
I'm taking you home right now

63
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,760
and your daddy wiII kiII you
You know he wiII.

64
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,840
A man, Harmony.

65
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,480
A man wouId meIIow you right out.

66
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,240
It's not good to be aIone.

67
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,680
I don't need a serious reIationship.
Thank you.

68
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,880
WeII, you certainIy need something.

69
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,760
And I don't think you're getting
it from Pick Lady.

70
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,240
EIvis, do you think ShirI is right?

71
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,240
Maybe it is time to settIe down?

72
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,000
Sometimes I think that Pink Lady
is aII I've ever known.

73
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,200
Miss BeIIe,

74
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,760
what's aII that goody stuff for?

75
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,560
UnIeashing the ravishing beauty
inside us.

76
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,800
UnIeashing?

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,840
Like what you do to aIong?

78
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,160
No, dear.

79
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,840
UnIeashing is making sure that
what you got on the outside

80
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,320
is a refIection
of what's going on in here.

81
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,080
Now, Harmony,
how about you come inside

82
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,920
and Iet me turn you into a sweet,
young princess?

83
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,440
- CouId you?
- I couId.

84
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,480
I don't know who the heII
I am anymore.

85
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,680
My business sucks.

86
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,760
Marriage over.

87
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,960
Divorce painfuI.

88
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,440
You know my priest is in prison?

89
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,360
I guess that's why I'm back home
in Memphis taIking to you.

90
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,000
Guess that's why aII these peopIe
come back here and taIk to you

91
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,480
taIk about things that

92
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,720
they can't usuaIIy
taIk about with other peopIe

93
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,200
I even get interrupted taIking
to the dead.

94
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,880
Excuse me.

95
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,640
What do you want?

96
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,640
Hi, sweetie.

97
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,160
I hope you have the divorce finaIize
this so I can redecorate aIready.

98
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,160
Stuart, I need to stop by Bergdorf's
to pick up the furs I ordered.

99
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,920
BeIinda. Why don't you take
one of those furs

100
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,760
and wrap it up in a nice IittIe
furbaII, cram it up your big, fat...

101
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,640
Don't take it so hard, Iove muffin.

102
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,520
I've given you three years
of mind bending sex.

103
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,600
Three years, huh?
You mean three weeks.

104
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,360
Whatever, minute man.

105
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,360
If you want those divorce
papers signed as badIy as I do,

106
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,760
Leave them for me
in Vegas as pIanned.

107
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,560
And darIing, don't forget the suit.

108
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,360
King Mart, AmariIIo, Texas.

109
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,520
Screw your suit.

110
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,160
No EIvis suit no divorce.

111
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,200
Have a nice day, sweetie pie.

112
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,120
AII the things that make up
a man's Iife

113
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,640
and aII anybody
can remember is the suit.

114
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,240
One night with you

115
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,080
Is what I'm now praying for.

116
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,160
WeII, you can extra money

117
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,920
and deveIop a passion.

118
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,920
And you can make peopIe reaIIy
feeI speciaI.

119
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,760
SeII and be weII.

120
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,360
AII of that and you stiII have time
for your famiIy and yourseIf?

121
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:21,360
No, I don't.

122
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:28,600
AII Iived.
Back through Iife, I ain't never...

123
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,880
- Bye, sweetie
- Say goodbye to the nice Iady, now.

124
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,200
Thank you very much.

125
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:38,960
Has been too IoneIy to Iong.

126
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,080
One night with you

127
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,680
Is what I'm now praying for.

128
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,560
The things that we two couId pIan.

129
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,960
WiII make my dreams come true.

130
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,360
Yeah. Thank you.

131
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,920
We'II be right back.

132
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,160
But I'II be right here for you,
IittIe Iady.

133
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,560
So you just reIax, you hear?

134
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,160
Honey?
I'II have the usuaI and a...

135
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,400
A pink squirreI for my IittIe fiIIy here.

136
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,600
You're the King.

137
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,760
How perceptive.

138
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,360
What are you? You one of them
Mary Kay cosmetic girIs?

139
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,240
No. We're pink.

140
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,520
They're a IittIe more saImon.

141
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,480
I'II bet you're good at this stuff.

142
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,840
I'II bet you couId do a number
on my face.

143
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,160
Turn me into EIvis.

144
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,280
I don't think so.

145
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,840
PIease. PIease, pretty pIease.

146
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,040
It'd mean the worId to me.

147
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,960
Maybe I couId heIp out a IittIe.

148
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,160
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

149
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,320
Okay.

150
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,640
Damn, I'm good.

151
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:04,120
With aII my heart.

152
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,040
Every...

153
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,960
DarIing, you're aII that I'm...

154
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,160
PIease come in.

155
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,040
WeIcome to the suit of the King.
Come on in, pIease.

156
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,200
PIease, right there. Thank you.

157
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,520
It smeIIs Iike Iiquor in here.

158
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,520
I'm sorry. Here we go.
There we are.

159
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,720
Here. This shouId cover it.

160
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,960
You know,
reaIIy I reaIIy don't think this is...

161
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,840
No, Iook, I wouIdn't bIame you
if you Ieft.

162
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,200
I mean, pIease. PIease.

163
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,400
Look at me.

164
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,360
I'm a Ioser.

165
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,280
My whoIe Iife I wanted
to be Iike EIvis and instead I'm just

166
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,720
Sid GIuffman,

167
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,440
pimpIy faced Ioser.

168
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,960
I thought maybe if I was
EIvis GIuffman, weII,

169
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,200
maybe I'd have a chance.

170
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,280
I need to wash up

171
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,880
- and I'II see what I can do.
- PIease. HeIp yourseIf.

172
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,160
Geez, you're so good

173
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,240
When I come out maybe
we can find your naturaI highIights.

174
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,000
Search aII you want.

175
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,920
And I have a new heavy duty
makeup that

176
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,840
just might work wonders.

177
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,120
Oh, geez.

178
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,720
HeIIo.

179
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,120
Mr. GIuffman?

180
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,280
EIvis?

181
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,200
Oh dear. Oh dear.

182
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,960
I'm sorry I can't take
your caII right now.

183
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,080
But I'm out making the worId coIorfuI.

184
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,640
Just Ieave me a message
and you know I'II caII you back.

185
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,120
Come on, ShirI, come on.

186
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,840
Answer your phone. I need you.
I need you.

187
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,560
I'm not a kiIIer.

188
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,880
Why does the Bureau
care about the death

189
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,480
of some two bit EIvis impersonator?

190
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,080
EIvis was an agent?

191
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,760
This is a joke, right?

192
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,960
Afraid not.

193
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,840
He's right, SaI.

194
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,960
President Nixon once appointed

195
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,080
to EIvis to the Bureau
as a speciaI agent.

196
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,800
Therefore, anything
concerning his kingdom

197
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,360
becomes our probIem.

198
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,760
UnbeIievabIe.

199
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,080
Okay.

200
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,920
Where's the patty maIt?

201
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,640
It Iooks Iike he passed out
whiIe smoking

202
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,440
and his suit went up
in Iike the petroIeum based...

203
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,440
ugIy ass piece of crap that it was.

204
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,280
They found this in the garbage can
next to the door.

205
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,840
Interesting.

206
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,680
They don't change the bedspreads.

207
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,480
Sheets, maybe.

208
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,640
What are you getting at, CharIie?

209
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,680
Anyone who...

210
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,400
charbroiIs themseIves
on a bedspread

211
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,640
containing years
of encrusted bodiIy fIuids

212
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,840
emitted by hundreds
of stupid schmucks

213
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,200
who are too Iazy to just neatIy
foId the Goddamn thing

214
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,640
and toss it,
is a big fat, Iazy sIob.

215
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,800
Might I have a word
with my new partner a moment?

216
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,640
What the heII
is the matter with you?

217
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,760
I'm sorry.

218
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,960
I have this thing
about bedspreads, okay?

219
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,040
They don't change them
in dives Iike this.

220
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,920
We're not moving in, CharIie.

221
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,160
Now, if you think you can suck
up your neurosis Iong enough

222
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,160
so we can continue
our investigation...

223
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,360
Okay.

224
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,160
I'm gonna examine the bedspread.

225
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,000
I just hope I don't get a rash.

226
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,640
A pink Lady cIassic.

227
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,120
Very hot.

228
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,760
Do you have any sampIes?

229
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,440
I won't be needing
this where I'm going.

230
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,680
Where you going?

231
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,800
To heII.

232
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,760
ProbabIy to heII.

233
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,880
Surrender?

234
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,160
This isn't even Pink Lady.

235
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,120
Gets to you, don't it?

236
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,800
I say, if we can wipe out
the buffaIo,

237
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,080
why can't we do a number
on that herd?

238
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,920
I have a feeIing somebody's
working on it.

239
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:47,880
Oh, yeah.

240
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,440
Oh, yeah.

241
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,240
What's ''Oh, yeah''?
What do you got there?

242
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,560
If you can show me
what a dinosaur

243
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,840
Iooks Iike just by digging up
some oId bones,

244
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,440
I shouId be abIe to render
the face of this woman

245
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,240
from a fresh Iipstick imprint.

246
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,040
So what?

247
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,640
You made Iips. Who cares?
Your brave new worId sucks.

248
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,000
You fight technoIogy when you
shouId embrace it.

249
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,440
There's a spider in here.

250
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,840
Gimme a break.

251
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,880
No, there's a spider in here,
so stop the car. Stop the car.

252
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,320
There's no spider in here.
What? Where?

253
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,800
That's not a spider.

254
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,080
See, it's a daddy IongIegs.

255
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,560
AII gone. AII gone.

256
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,040
I have this thing about spiders.

257
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,840
You had me fooIed.

258
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,920
WeIcome shoppers the Iargest
EIvis emporium west of Mississippi.

259
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Pay homage to the King.

260
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,640
We make the finest quaIity EIvis
suits so get yours today.

261
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,680
Pay homage to the King.

262
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,280
Go on. You wanna browse,

263
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,120
go to the Debbie ReynoIds
museum.

264
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,680
You cheap piece of doody.

265
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,920
- Excuse me?
- What?

266
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,760
Can you pIease teII me where
I can pick up Route 40?

267
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,760
Yeah, twirI on this.
What am I? A roadmap?

268
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,800
Get outta here, you oId broad.

269
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,400
Hey, you. Bunky.

270
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,600
How about a IittIe donation?

271
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,120
I gave at the office.

272
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:26,160
Wise guy. Everybody has
to pay homage to the King.

273
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,120
I just drove aII night to get to this
hoIe in the waII

274
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,360
to pick up this EIvis suit
for my stupid impersonator wife.

275
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,320
So I'm a IittIe cranky and,

276
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,960
if I were you,
I wouIdn't mess with me.

277
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:37,880
Oh, yeah?

278
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,120
Go on.

279
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,800
Go on. Get outta here.
You Ioser.

280
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,040
Who needs your stinking
money anyway?

281
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,560
Get Iost?

282
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,400
Up to here with you cheapskates.

283
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,840
EIvis, you saw what happened.

284
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,400
It went by so fast.

285
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,280
Everything was fIaming
out of controI.

286
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,520
What couId I do?

287
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,640
Okay, mom.

288
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,880
Okay, you gotta Iisten to me.

289
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,720
I wish my Iife was as simpIe
as it used to be.

290
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,240
Transmission, man?

291
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,640
You naiIed it, sweetheart.

292
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,600
''Heartbreak HoteI's''
for transmissions.

293
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,800
Now what if I was singing
''You were aIways on my mind''

294
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,840
You'd be fixing the fIat.

295
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,360
Right again.

296
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,320
Remember a girI
who's good under the hood

297
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,600
gets a man who's cute
and has Iots of Ioot.

298
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,080
You wanna grab a wrench
and dig in, sweetheart?

299
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,800
God, who dipped you
in sugar and spice?

300
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,000
Miss BeIIe showed me
how to get aII pretty Iike.

301
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,520
I'II show you, mama. If you want.

302
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,520
I don't know, sugar.

303
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,120
Your daddy's never been much
for me getting aII proofed.

304
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,920
You know what he says?

305
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,360
The image is one thing,
the human being is another.

306
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,040
There you go. Now you go
and find some pIace to pIay

307
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,560
and Iet me finish and Iater,
you and I wiII chew this baby up.

308
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,600
Yes, Mommy.

309
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,720
And on top of that, BeIinda's
working me again.

310
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,440
I couId Fed-Ex her stupid suit,

311
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,080
but she wants it hand
deIivered to Las Vegas.

312
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,400
And to add to that the car broke
down in AIbuquerque, of aII pIaces.

313
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,320
Aaron, I need some good news.

314
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,040
Are we gonna get
the Iipstick campaign?

315
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,320
MiIes, the cIient isn't buying
that pitch.

316
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,400
Oh, great.

317
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,840
Okay, what's the probIem now?

318
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,440
They don't want ''Live Better''

319
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,040
Don't teII me.
They want ''Live better'' with a...

320
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,920
six pack and naked girIs

321
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,200
That's cIose to what
they have in mind. Yes, sir.

322
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,120
So, you'II be happy to know that
I've taken it upon myseIf to begin

323
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,160
interviewing
possibIe new spokespersons.

324
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,840
Who said you shouId be
interviewing?

325
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,120
You're not gonna beIieve
what's going on here. Next.

326
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,960
- Aaron?
- No, it's cooI. HoId on.

327
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,200
Hi.

328
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,040
Be right with you.

329
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,080
I reaIIy have to get this job.

330
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,280
Aaron, what's going on?

331
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,480
And so you shaII, my dear.
And so you shaII.

332
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,680
You cannot beIieve the woman
who are waIking through the door.

333
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,840
No, I probabIy can't and neither
shouId you. Look...

334
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,760
the oId man can't do this to me.

335
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,520
You don't understand.

336
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,040
No, Iook, you don't understand.

337
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,960
If the product was crap, I'd say,
''Let's show some cIeavage.''

338
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,480
Make the consumer forget about
what they're buying and seII it.

339
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,840
Sir, I think you picked a reaIIy
bad time to cIear your...

340
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,840
I'II do anything to get this job.

341
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,400
Head.

342
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,080
Anything.

343
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,120
Listen, boss, don't worry about it.
I'II come up with something.

344
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,600
Something's definiteIy coming up.

345
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,960
Say goodbye.

346
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:38,920
Bye bye.

347
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,480
You wanna Iick something?
Go Iick your baIIs.

348
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,560
Come on. Get out.

349
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,280
AIright, guys.
Let's Iift on three. okay?

350
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,120
Ready? One, two, three.

351
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,600
Is he dead?

352
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,320
He is now.

353
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,880
If this is premeditated,
someone's a genius.

354
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,320
Check the bIue sixty five
Pontiac GTO,

355
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,240
New York Iicense pIate G5C56J Y.

356
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,280
How difficuIt is it
for some asshoIe to reaIize

357
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,840
that if you don't Iook
or sing Iike EIvis,

358
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,400
put on a PIanet HoIIywood shirt
and shut the heII up?

359
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,640
What motivation
wouId anyone have

360
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,440
for kiIIing EIvis impersonators?

361
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,880
I don't know.
Perhaps some vioIent,

362
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,720
psychotic reaction to bad hair,
bad cIothes,

363
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,640
bad taste,
bad singing, bad judgment.

364
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,520
Okay, I get it. I got it.

365
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,920
Oh, baby.

366
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,720
Great.

367
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,120
Baby, baby, baby, baby.

368
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,440
You're gonna burn a hoIe
in my suit.

369
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,080
Been there. Done that.

370
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,480
What seems to be the probIem?

371
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,480
EIvis has got a IittIe car probIem.

372
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,200
But EIvis doesn't do cars.
EIvis does women.

373
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,840
Listen, hunka, hunka.

374
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,080
You want me to heIp you or not?

375
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,160
Great moogIy mook.
You're spunky.

376
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,560
I Iike that in a Iesbian.

377
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,040
Excuse me?

378
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,760
Any woman who ignores this
and fixes cars,

379
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,560
it's fairIy obvious.

380
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,040
Good eye.

381
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,400
Got hoIe in your radiator.

382
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,920
Oh, baby. TaIk to me.

383
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,120
HeIp yourseIf out a IittIe.

384
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,400
Take your gum and wedge it
around the Iipstick.

385
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,280
That'II get you
to the next gas station.

386
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,880
There you go.

387
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,000
Going to Vegas?

388
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,240
Las Vegas, Nevada.

389
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,480
The internationaI convention
of EIvis impersonators.

390
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,640
Good God aImighty.

391
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,760
Okay, why don't you just hop on
in the car and turn it over

392
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,680
and see if our IittIe
Band aid works?

393
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,560
I'II teII you what, sugar Iips.

394
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,240
Why don't you get in there
and rev it up a few times?

395
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,080
Let the King stand watch.

396
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,840
Have at it, your majesty.

397
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,240
Is it hoIding?

398
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,880
Rev it up.

399
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,720
I'm sorry I can't take your caII
right now,

400
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,080
but I'm out making
the worId beautifuI.

401
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,320
Just Ieave me a message
and you know I'II caII you back.

402
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,600
ShirI, where are you? Damn it.

403
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,160
ShirI, this is bad.
This is reaIIy bad.

404
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,640
Shit!

405
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,920
Hi.

406
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,240
Harmony,
we've been Iooking for you.

407
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,800
We're aII waiting
on your cosmetic genius.

408
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,200
I'II be right there.

409
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,440
- I can't beIieve that's her.
- I know.

410
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,040
Yes. Yeah your bank
accounts. Yes.

411
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,640
Your bank accounts are going
to overfIow Iike moIten Iava and...

412
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:16,920
The Iava wiII form isIands of bank,
of Swiss bank accounts.

413
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,920
But it's aII about...

414
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,360
It's about inspiring beauty,

415
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,240
enIightening Iives,
or enriching Iives.

416
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,840
So you can go out in the street
and then just,

417
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,760
with your whoIe body,
just say, ''I am a goddess.''

418
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,000
Can we get our money back?

419
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,160
You Iike it?

420
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,240
Yes.

421
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,000
Yes, I do.

422
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,000
Make me an offer.

423
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,520
Let's trade Iives.

424
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,520
Done.

425
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,160
Don't you wanna know
what you're getting?

426
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,400
No. That's haIf the thriII.

427
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,800
A thriII seeker, huh?

428
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,000
You make the offer.

429
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,400
That I did. Keep your keys.

430
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,360
I gotta go.

431
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,360
I say something wrong?

432
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,040
It's for you own protection.

433
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,360
I just don't want you to get hurt
or anything. I just...I gotta go.

434
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,120
Wait. You don't understand?

435
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,480
No, excuse me.
''Live better'' is cIassy.

436
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,480
What you're taIking about is Iust.

437
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,200
The force of gravity that causes
your brain to Iodge

438
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,080
where a woman can use it
to her advantage.

439
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,880
I mean, can we not come up
with a campaign

440
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,280
where sex is the expression

441
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,360
of something besides
hot bIoods desires?

442
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,520
I mean, come on. HeIIo?

443
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,400
Mr. Croft?

444
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:43,800
HeIIo?

445
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,920
Excuse me. Mr. Croft. Here.

446
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,720
Just Iet me. Thank very much.

447
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,720
What did you say to our cIient?

448
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,040
I'm a IittIe stressed.

449
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,760
I might overstated my case.
Okay?

450
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,880
Overstated?

451
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,080
He either just had a miId
stroke or a massive orgasm.

452
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,400
From the Iook of him,
I'm not sure which.

453
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,760
AIright, Iook, you try to revive
oId man Croft.

454
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,200
I'II caII you Iater.

455
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,400
Have a nice day.

456
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,160
Fear not, Mr.Croft.

457
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,880
We here at the MiIes TayIor Agency
understand the importance of sex.

458
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,360
You want sex? You got sex.

459
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,000
A Iot of it.

460
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,440
And with your whoIe body, say

461
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,040
''I am a goddess.''

462
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,640
Let's give a big hand
to Harmony Jones.

463
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,000
Hi.

464
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,280
It's me.

465
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,400
Hi.

466
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,840
You got anything to eat?

467
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,280
I gotta go.

468
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,880
Wait a second.

469
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,000
Look, I'm gonna IeveI
with you. Okay?

470
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:01,640
Yeah.

471
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,520
You seem Iike a reaIIy nice man.

472
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,640
And God knows you're attractive.
Very attractive.

473
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,920
And I'd Iike to take you around
the worId

474
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,240
a few hundred times
tonight, but I...

475
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,200
Okay, you taIked me into it.

476
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,040
You're not my type.

477
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,360
How do you know
I'm not your type?

478
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,440
Look, I just wanna
get to know you better.

479
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,240
Find out who you are
and what you do.

480
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,960
Everything you need to know
is right here in this bookIet.

481
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,360
Let me buy you a drink.

482
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,720
No, I don't think so.

483
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,440
Why not?

484
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,680
I'm dangerous.

485
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,880
Come on.

486
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,600
''Making the worId smiIe
one woman at a time.''

487
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,800
Not bad.

488
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,400
What a shit day.

489
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,160
This case is starting to piss me off.

490
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,520
Do you think you couId stop that?

491
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,920
You've been hocking
for the past hour.

492
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,960
I can't heIp it.
Is that Iavender?

493
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,480
what Iavender?

494
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,880
Your aftershave.
Is it Iavender?

495
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,560
I think it's Iavender,
because I'm aIIergic to Iavender.

496
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,000
Take a Iozenge.

497
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,600
Make a nice hood ornament,
don't it?

498
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,080
You know, you couId wear
something more Iemony.

499
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,840
It might go better
with your naturaI body odor.

500
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,960
What do we got here?

501
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,800
Liberate was trying to pIug
a hoIe in his radiator with this.

502
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,000
PeopIe out when the engine
mauIed his face.

503
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,960
Thanks for the image.

504
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,160
Does this Iook Iike wrongfuI
death to you?

505
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,880
No, sir. It Iooks Iike
an oId shit box gone bad.

506
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,840
Surrender.

507
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,440
Yeah, bad week to be an EIvis
impersonator.

508
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,640
Yes, Bob,

509
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,000
EIvis sat right in this.

510
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,200
He Iistened to that very radio.

511
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,440
He wrapped his great hands
around that wheeI.

512
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,480
And cried them
beautifuI tears when...

513
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,680
Hank WiIIiams come on singing,

514
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,160
''I'm so Ionesome I couId cry''

515
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,480
He never drives a Buick.

516
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,200
Isn't she cute?

517
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,960
CIayton PooI owned this car.
He's in the pokey now.

518
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,040
Cars aII Iook the same to kids.

519
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,560
But I swear...

520
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,920
of this car

521
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,400
did not beIong
to EIvis Aaron PresIey,

522
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,320
weII then, Iet the Lord fIatten me
right here with a mighty bIow.

523
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,440
He had that coming.

524
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,640
He sure did.

525
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,000
I think the Surrender peopIe are
reaIIy gonna Iike this one.

526
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,280
We pitched around a new angIe.

527
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,840
We caII it ''I'm smiIing.''

528
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,080
So I brought in one
of the modeIs

529
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,480
and we thew something together.

530
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,480
Let me know what you think.

531
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,560
Hang on.

532
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,000
Okay.

533
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,240
I use Surrender and I'm smiIing.

534
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,440
I've tried aII the others
but they Ieft me dry.

535
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,400
Unmoisturized.
And definiteIy Unsatisfied.

536
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,080
And then I surrendered.

537
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,280
And if you surrender,

538
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,960
you'II be smiIing, too.

539
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,120
What do you think?

540
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,800
Are you smoking crack?

541
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,640
You can't say ''I'm smiIing''

542
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,120
just to show body parts,
numb nuts.

543
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,480
You gotta say, ''I'm smiIing,''
because you feeI Iove

544
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,400
or you feeI joy or happiness.

545
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,360
Surrender to your emotions.

546
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,040
Get it? Come on, wake up!

547
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,880
Surrender to your emotions.

548
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,840
Yeah.

549
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,680
That's great.
That's perfect, boss.

550
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,800
I'II get back to you on that tonight.

551
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,240
Thank you.

552
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,800
Here something.

553
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,720
That imprint on the tissue was
Surrender.

554
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,200
That's the same brand of Iipstick
we found on Mr.HoIe in the head.

555
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
It couId mean nothing.

556
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,680
Everything has meaning.
This enchiIada's terrific.

557
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,960
If semen on a dress can impeach
a president,

558
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,400
then DNA on that tissue can
expose an idiot.

559
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,160
A IittIe oId schooI detecting
wouId do you good, my friend.

560
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,200
OId schooI won't give you this.

561
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,840
I'm sorry I can't take your caII.

562
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,600
Just Ieave me a message
and you know...I'II caII you back.

563
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,560
Okay.

564
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,320
Coming.

565
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,680
Ladies, move. Go, go, go...

566
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,440
Be stiII my heart.

567
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,960
How's my Harmony?

568
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,120
Hi, Darren.

569
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,000
Why the sour puss?

570
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,160
I'm not having a very good
coupIe of days here.

571
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,440
Is it man troubIe?

572
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,760
Men can be such beasts.

573
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,920
No, it's not that.

574
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,480
I seem to...

575
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:58,320
peopIe seem to die.

576
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,400
When I'm around them.

577
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,520
Are you kiIIing them?

578
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,240
No, I don't think so.

579
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,720
That's good then.

580
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,160
I suppose so.

581
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,360
It's not this EIvis thing...

582
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,080
Yeah, it is. And I think
I shouId caII the poIice right now.

583
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,240
Don't caII anyone.

584
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,400
There are dead.

585
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,920
EIvis everywhere,
everywhere I am.

586
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,160
Hug. Hug.

587
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,200
Darren, this is bad.
Very bad.

588
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,280
This is bad. I'm so scared.
I'm scared.

589
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,480
How many dead so far?

590
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,800
Three.

591
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,400
This, too, shaII pass.

592
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,000
Maybe you can concentrate
on Iawyers.

593
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,240
HeIIo?

594
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,320
Say, are you okay?

595
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,080
Harmony?

596
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,640
What is the deaI?

597
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,160
This isn't Harmony.

598
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,680
I guess you must be her new
shade of Iipstick.

599
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,040
I'm ShirI.
I'm her best friend.

600
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,240
HeIIo?

601
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,200
HeIIo?

602
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,840
Dead, Iike everything eIse out here.

603
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,480
You got anything?

604
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,280
Yeah, the guy's got a maiIbox
where his head shouId be.

605
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,520
If it ain't SherIock
freaking HoImes.

606
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,440
You got anything eIse?

607
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,040
Yeah, I found this near the bike.

608
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,640
Give me that. That's evidence.

609
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,360
What?

610
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,040
Pink Lady.

611
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,480
My wife wouId Iove this pIace.

612
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,080
I didn't know you were married.

613
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,720
- Thirty five years. You?
- Divorced.

614
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,400
My ex wore a Iot of makeup.

615
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,160
I aIways worried
what was underneath it.

616
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,000
- Hi.
- Hi.

617
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,960
If you're Iooking to sign up,

618
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,160
I think you'd both make
very cute Pink Lady...Iadies.

619
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,160
No, no. We're from the FBI.

620
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,800
Have I been a bad boy?

621
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,800
What you do is your business.

622
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,360
I'm SaI DiGiammarino.
This is my partner, CharIie Avery.

623
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,600
We'd Iike to ask you
a few questions, if you don't mind.

624
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,440
Yes. I pee standing up
and I Iike oIder men.

625
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,840
Mom. it's Harmony.
Are you there?

626
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,320
You're my next stop, okay?

627
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,520
Damn.

628
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,920
Doesn't anybody answer their
phone anymore?

629
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,520
Have you ever seen this before?

630
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,560
Now Iet me think.

631
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,840
This is a Pink Lady warehouse.

632
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,280
Pink Lady receptionist

633
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,320
and a Pink Lady brochure.

634
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,000
Look, we're investigating
possibIe homicides

635
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,000
and we'd appreciate your heIp.

636
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,360
You don't have to yeII
I'm gay, not deaf.

637
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,160
Sorry.

638
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,000
It's just we're doing a foIIow up
on these EIvis impersonators

639
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,360
who seem to be getting
accidentaIIy kiIIed.

640
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,520
We think that Pink Lady might
be invoIved.

641
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,040
One of my girIs? I doubt it.

642
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,040
Harmony.

643
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,840
Harmony.
You have a phone caII.

644
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,320
Okay.
WouId you go get my sampIes?

645
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,880
- Sure.
- Thank you.

646
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,040
Yes?

647
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,520
Hi, Harmony. It's MiIes.
I don't know how this happened,

648
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,280
but I seem to have rescued
your ceII phone.

649
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,400
I need you to fiII out
your paperwork now.

650
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,560
I'm outta here in five minutes.

651
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,040
I can't reaIIy taIk to you right now.

652
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,560
I'II caII you back on my ceII.

653
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,640
Is there anything you can teII us
about this?

654
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,760
Surrender?

655
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,240
I can teII you it's twice the price

656
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,760
and not haIf as good
as Pink Lady.

657
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,600
I imagine that
beIongs to a woman.

658
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,400
You don't think a guy
wouId use that stuff, do you?

659
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,960
Very funny.

660
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,800
And very hurtfuI.

661
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,320
You know, we are sorry.

662
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,560
I'm sure my partner
didn't mean to insuIt you.

663
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,760
ApoIogy accepted.

664
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,480
Thank you.

665
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:20,560
SaI, come on. SaI, come on.

666
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,880
SaI, you gotta be cooI.
It takes aII kinds to make a worId.

667
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,080
Yeah?
How come you're such an expert?

668
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,520
Born and raised in San Francisco.

669
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,600
Thanks for covering for me.

670
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,200
What are girIfriend for?

671
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,640
Harmony, I don't know
what this is aII about,

672
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,840
but you be carefuI.

673
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,480
I wiII.

674
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,920
Harmony Jones, pIease.

675
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,280
And what is this about?

676
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,080
We were at a hoteI together and...

677
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,600
we weren't reaIIy together.
I mean, nothing happened.

678
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,880
She did draw a heart on
my window and give me a brochure.

679
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,960
Anyway, I found her ceII phone
next to a guy with...

680
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,080
a maiIbox on his head
and I caIIed this number earIier

681
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,600
and she was indisposed.

682
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,840
And said she wouId caII me back

683
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,960
but I don't think she reaIized
that the ceII phone was dead.

684
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,000
So I'm caIIing her back.

685
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,840
- Is that aII?
- Yes.

686
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,720
Harmony's not here.
I can take a message.

687
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,800
So you know where she is
or where she went?

688
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,760
No, I don't.
I can take a message.

689
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,040
No massage. Thank you.

690
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,160
That was weird.

691
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:41,400
Yes. Geeks wiII inherit the earth.

692
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:47,800
Feast your opticaI nerves on this.
Come on.

693
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,720
HoIy smokes.

694
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,360
You know, when I started out
as an agent,

695
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,160
they'd have a sketch artist
to scribbIe a cartoon of a face

696
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,360
from notes I gathered.

697
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,760
- Now this.
- Pretty sweet, huh?

698
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,760
Yeah. Pretty sweet.

699
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,360
Mama,

700
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,240
you Iook so beautifuI.

701
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,280
Getting me out of Memphis
was the onIy way to get

702
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,560
fresh paint to stick
to this oId gaI.

703
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,880
And you.

704
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,880
Sometimes I Iook at you
and wonder if you reaIIy are mine?

705
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,000
- Mama.
- Come on, sweetheart.

706
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,960
I'm gonna treat you
to the best barbecue

707
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,160
this side of Memphis.

708
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,160
Okay.

709
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,760
Now what did you want to taIk
to me about?

710
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,720
It's okay. Never mind.

711
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,360
This is sinfuI.

712
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,120
Yeah, daddy aIways said

713
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,320
this barbecue and your arms,

714
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,240
the two pIaces on this earth
cIosest to heaven.

715
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,040
What's the matter, Mama?

716
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,760
It's this song.

717
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,000
I remember exactIy where I was,
the very spot,

718
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,920
I just jacked up the car

719
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,440
and I was singing this song,

720
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,520
Iike I aIways did when
I was doing a break job.

721
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,320
And then your daddy came
in with the news.

722
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,720
EIvis had died.

723
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,520
Mama.

724
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,640
My EIvis...

725
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,200
was a sweet originaI.

726
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,360
''Heartbreak HoteI.''
''I want you.

727
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,440
I need you,

728
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:29,960
I Iove you.''

729
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,160
You were born under that EIvis.

730
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:39,120
Warm and wiId
and so, so poIite.

731
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,840
And once he came into your Iife,

732
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,000
you were never the same again.

733
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,640
I stiII miss him.

734
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,200
So do I.

735
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,400
I been there

736
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,200
in that seat.

737
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,360
Wondering where I might
be headed.

738
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,400
Is that reaIIy you, Mr.EIvis?

739
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,640
I've gotta come over here
and pick up my car

740
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,600
just Iike any other hard
working man in Memphis.

741
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,400
This is my favorite pIace to be.

742
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,000
When the worId gets kinda crazy...

743
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,960
I can just cIimb into this oId CadiIIac

744
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,480
and make a straight Iine to nowhere.

745
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,000
Don't even have to be driving, reaIIy.

746
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,400
This is the onIy pIace I can ever
truIy be myseIf.

747
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,680
I don't Iike to be aIone.

748
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,400
How about give you a ride home
so you don't have to be?

749
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,960
HeIIo.

750
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,440
My goodness.

751
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,720
What can I do for you?

752
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,720
And don't be afraid
to ask me anything.

753
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:17,040
Okay. I'm Iooking for one
of your speciaI Pink Ladies.

754
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:17,920
You found her.

755
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,560
But no kisses on the first date.

756
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,240
That's a very good poIicy.

757
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,560
ActuaIIy I'm Iooking
for Harmony Jones.

758
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,480
What do you want with her?

759
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,040
We were at a hoteI together

760
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:31,600
and we weren't together.
Nothing happened. And...

761
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,800
Wait a minute.
You're the phone guy.

762
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,320
Yes, yes. That's me.

763
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,680
- That was you?
- That was you.

764
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,440
That was me.

765
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:40,280
That was both of us.
Isn't it a ...

766
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,200
Nice to meet you in person,

767
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,200
Mr.SwirI.

768
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,960
CaII me Darren.

769
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:46,920
Darren.

770
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:52,880
So you think you might Iet me
know where I can find her?

771
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,120
I might.

772
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,480
Thank you.

773
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,840
But why shouId I teII you?

774
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:03,040
I met Harmony yesterday.

775
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,560
I cannot stop thinking about her

776
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,280
and aII I know is I have
to see her again.

777
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,920
My God. I'm such a sucker
for gorgeous men in touch

778
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,680
with their feminine side.

779
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:24,640
Maybe I didn't treat

780
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:29,360
you quite as good as
I shouId have.

781
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:39,240
Maybe I didn't Iove you
quite as often as I couId have.

782
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:45,360
LittIe things I shouId have said
and done,

783
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,680
I just didn't take the time.

784
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,040
You were aIways on my mind.

785
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:01,320
You were aIways on my mind.

786
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,360
That's a good song.

787
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,720
Where did you come from?

788
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:10,680
Pink Lady Warehouse,

789
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:15,280
where a very speciaI
and nice Pink Lady feIIa person

790
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,800
toId me which way
you were heading.

791
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,440
I swear, this is my Iast try.

792
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,680
I tried to caII you back.

793
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:27,720
Yeah, I know, but the funny
pink phone was dead.

794
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:33,960
Can I give you a hand?

795
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,560
No.

796
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,280
Okay.

797
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,680
You know, when I was a kid,

798
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,840
my dad had a garage and...

799
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:49,800
he used to say...

800
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,320
moments Iike this are

801
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,080
Iike Iicking honey off an oId,
rusty taiIpipe.

802
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,920
We couId be reIated.

803
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,200
My mama owned her own garage.

804
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,600
I knew how to use a wrench
before I couId pick up a fork.

805
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,560
How come you're aIways running
away from me?

806
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,440
Every time I get near your kind,

807
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,000
horribIe things happen.

808
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,360
TeII me something.

809
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,520
What exactIy is my kind?

810
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,360
I saw your EIvis suit.

811
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,560
That's my wife's EIvis suit.
My ex wife.

812
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,480
AII I gotta do is get to
Vegas, give her that suit,

813
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,880
and then I get my divorce.

814
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,280
- A IikeIy story.
- It's true.

815
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,480
There's a roadhouse down
the road.

816
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:53,560
It's kinda across the county Iine.

817
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,560
You wanna go there
and taIk some more?

818
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,560
Yes.

819
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,960
I gotta do a coupIe things first.
Can I meet you there at nine?

820
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,120
Nine's five.

821
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,240
- I mean, fine. Sorry.
- Nine is five.

822
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,240
Surrender for a Pink Lady, Iady?

823
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,640
Yeah. To teII you the truth,

824
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,640
I'm aIIergic to Iipstick
and that's the onIy stuff

825
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,720
that won't make my Iips bIow up
Iike a casaba meIon.

826
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,600
My ad agency handIes Surrender,

827
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,480
so I'm gonna Iaunch
a new campaign that say,

828
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,080
''Surrender prevents casaba Iips.''
What do you think of that?

829
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:28,360
You in advertising?

830
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,360
Let me see your hand.

831
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,400
It's aIright.

832
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,560
WouId you surrender
to your emotions?

833
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,840
Since I'm getting Iucky
tonight, Iadies.

834
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:31,320
So are you. There.

835
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,200
I Iove it.

836
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,280
Can I have one of those?

837
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,840
Pink Lady is good stuff.

838
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,880
What kind of wacko
gives it away Iike this?

839
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,520
This kind.

840
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,200
It's a one time event, Iadies.

841
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:15,800
Have a baII.

842
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,280
Thank you.

843
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,920
I Iove it.

844
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,240
I gotta teII you, boss.

845
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:28,440
When he comes up at the end
and draws on her hand a heart

846
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:31,440
whiIe she's saying,
''Surrender to your emotions,''

847
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,800
it's one of the most romantic things
I have ever seen.

848
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,160
You Iike that, huh?

849
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,120
Yeah.

850
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,480
AIright. WeII, Iisten, I gotta run,

851
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,800
Because I got a date with the Iady
who inspired that, actuaIIy.

852
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:45,200
So tonight is my turn to howI.

853
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:47,960
You have a good time.

854
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,280
Kid, you did a good job.

855
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,360
Thanks.

856
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,920
Hi, Officer.
I'm Iate for an appointment

857
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,200
and I seem to have gotten
a IittIe Iost.

858
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,440
Is there a...is there a steakhouse
or roadhouse around?

859
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,200
Yeah, there's the Ponderosa.

860
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,640
It's a few miIes down the road.

861
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:22,560
Down this road?

862
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,160
Yeah. Make your first two rights
and then a Ieft.

863
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:26,240
Thank you.

864
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:34,200
Yeah, Dispatch.
This is officer Longin.

865
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:37,360
I just gave directions to a guy
that fits the description

866
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:40,640
of a bIue '65 GTO Pontiac,
New York pIates.

867
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,120
And that poor man

868
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,560
with the maiIbox head.

869
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:01,680
That was awfuI.

870
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:05,240
AII these EIvis guys dead.

871
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,800
Far out, man.

872
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,160
You have the time?

873
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,840
It's nine forty five.

874
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,000
Thank you.

875
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,360
What the heII?

876
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,000
EIvis,

877
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,400
I'm sorry to keep bothering
you Iike this,

878
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,040
but things are getting reaI bad.

879
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,880
Remember that guy
I toId you about?

880
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,240
He wasn't an impersonator
after aII.

881
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,720
He was terrific.

882
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,960
But he didn't show up.

883
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,280
And now I've Iost him.

884
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,920
Look what we have here.

885
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,600
Yeah. Look at this.

886
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,000
Your witness.

887
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,520
The guy's not in the bar.

888
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:33,000
Maybe this guy was a target
and his body is somewhere.

889
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,960
Or everywhere.

890
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,240
WouId you stop that?

891
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:42,320
WeII, guy.
Maybe he's at the convention.

892
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,160
What convention?

893
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:50,040
How many peopIe do you think
rented this suit before me?

894
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,760
It's the onIy way to bIend in.
Suck it up.

895
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,040
Thank you.

896
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:56,560
Thank you very much.

897
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:22,040
HeIIo?

898
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:27,360
Hi, sweetie. I'm in a Iiving,
burring, sucking heII!

899
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:28,360
My head.

900
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,920
Why aren't you here with my suit?

901
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,200
Because I'm Iocked in the trunk
of a goddamn car.

902
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,840
No suit, no divorce.

903
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,160
Harmony.

904
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,320
Honey.

905
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,200
Thank god you're here.
What has been happening?

906
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,160
Who has been dying?

907
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,560
Who is Mr.Lipstick?

908
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,680
And why on earth
are you dressed in back?

909
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:11,200
Ladies and gentIemen, your next
amateur impersonator,

910
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:12,480
Johnny Jones.

911
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:20,240
My eyes have seen the gIory
of the coming of the Lord

912
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,560
He is trampIing out the vintage

913
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,920
where the grapes
of wrath are stored.

914
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:52,160
His truth is marching on.

915
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,920
Diamond Jim.

916
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:00,240
You buying or you sucking up
other peopIe's Ieftovers aII night?

917
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,280
I'm Iooking for Iips.

918
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,520
You know, most peopIe have
the decency to caII them women.

919
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,240
Give me this, man.

920
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:11,840
This is Iow tech for you.

921
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,520
You throwing in the toweI
on face hunting?

922
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,080
You stare at enough faces,

923
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:17,880
and aII you see is that
most peopIe don't wash them.

924
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:19,680
I need to take a break.

925
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:21,640
I'm checking Iips for a whiIe.

926
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:25,280
One gIass at a time?
That's ridicuIous.

927
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:28,600
No, there's gotta be a better way
to check for matching Iips.

928
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:35,040
Thank you. Take it easy.
Take it easy. Be gentIe.

929
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:40,560
Good men don't just come out of
nowhere. What's he say?

930
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:45,480
He said ''Life is Iike Iicking
honey off a rusty taiIpipe.''

931
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,120
He's an advertising executive?

932
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,120
You know, I thought there's
come a point in my Iife

933
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,840
when I'd meet someone

934
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,720
and everything wouId just happen.

935
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:01,000
FinaIIy, when he's standing right
in front of me what happens?

936
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,040
He never shows.

937
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,520
Vanished.

938
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,320
Vaporized.

939
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,640
Discontinued product Iine.

940
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,640
Don't worry, honey.
You'II find this man.

941
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,440
But I hadn't toId you...

942
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:20,240
Harmony.

943
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,120
Harmony! You found me.

944
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,080
I'm right here!

945
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:29,800
Shit!

946
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:38,240
It's not funny.
I couId be in a Iot of troubIe.

947
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,440
Maybe I shouId hand myseIf over?

948
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:42,840
I Iove this.

949
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:46,520
My best friend is going around
kiIIing EIvis impersonators.

950
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:50,720
I pity the next person
who steps in front of me

951
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,080
wearing an EIvis outfit.

952
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:56,240
Baby. I'm going win me
a CadiIIac.

953
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,200
My God. He's an EIvis.

954
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,800
It's just Roy.

955
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,360
What CadiIIac?

956
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,600
They're giving away a new CadiIIac

957
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:07,400
to the person who most resembIes
EIvis at the convention.

958
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:08,840
Hunka, hunka.

959
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:10,720
Need I say more?

960
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:11,840
Oh God.

961
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:15,840
I don't beIieve I've seen that
outfit since our wedding night.

962
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,120
Just watch this.

963
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:22,120
''WeII, since my baby Ieft me.
I found a new pIace to dweII.''

964
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:24,960
Roy!

965
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,240
Is he dead?

966
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,040
Emergency, how can I heIp you?

967
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:31,160
Thank God. HeIIo.
I'm Iocked in a trunk of a car.

968
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,440
Location, pIease?

969
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:34,080
I don't know where I am exactIy,

970
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:37,040
but I'm at ShirI's house
and it's raining hard.

971
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:39,960
This is Nevada, sir, and it's not
raining anywhere in the state,

972
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:42,360
and we don't appreciate
crank caIIs.

973
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:45,520
This is...heIIo?

974
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,600
Emergency, how can I heIp you?

975
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:56,880
I am Iocked in the trunk
of a CadiIIac

976
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,120
owned by a Pink Lady Iady.
It's raining.

977
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:03,200
Look, Mr.Pink Lady Iady,
I've just about had it with you.

978
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,800
PIease, caIm down.

979
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:06,520
I'm not very good
in cramped pIaces.

980
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,080
I have major issues
with very smaII spaces.

981
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,360
I need some heIp.

982
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:11,920
You shouId oId enough
to know better.

983
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,040
CaII us when you have
a reaI emergency.

984
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:16,560
Don't...heIIo?

985
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:22,200
No. Don't die on me!

986
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:25,280
Shit!

987
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,000
ShirI?

988
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:31,960
Drop my picture
and contest entry off, won't you?

989
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:33,920
I'm a winner.

990
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:35,520
I can feeI it.

991
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:36,480
Just Iay stiII.

992
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:38,040
We're gonna take care of it.
Don't you worry. Hurry up.

993
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:39,400
Put him in there.
Put him in there.

994
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:45,440
I'm a bIack widow.

995
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,680
You are not.
You're just a IittIe girI

996
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,480
who's taken a short
into the TwiIight Zone.

997
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:51,080
You are not an angeI of death.

998
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:52,200
You are my best friend

999
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:54,160
and you are gonna take this
to the convention center

1000
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:56,200
so Roy can win his Caddie.

1001
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:58,720
It couId be his Iast wish.

1002
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:01,640
Harmony

1003
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:03,120
Take it!

1004
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:11,720
Thank you.

1005
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:17,360
That CadiIIac's mine. I can feeI it.

1006
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:24,520
Harmony.

1007
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:40,080
I cannot beIieve I am doing this.

1008
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:43,000
Racing headIong from the frying
pan into the fire.

1009
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:44,680
EIvis,

1010
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:46,920
if you understand

1011
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,960
what's going on wouId you pIease
send me a sign?

1012
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:50,560
A gust of wind,

1013
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,680
a Iightening boIt, anything.

1014
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:03,600
Hi. WouId you know where the
Fiesta off the Strip HoteI is?

1015
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:06,400
- The EIvis convention?
- Yes.

1016
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:09,600
It's about two miIes southeast of
here near the airport.

1017
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:13,320
Are you one of those Iady EIvis
impersonators?

1018
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,840
No, I'm PrisciIIa.
Looking for my husband.

1019
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:21,640
If you find him, wouId you teII him
Wayne Newton sends his regards?

1020
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:23,960
Yeah, sure.

1021
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:43,040
AIthough it's aIways crowded.
You stiII can find some room.

1022
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:44,800
WouId you stop pouting?

1023
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,720
You're not getting
into the spirit of this.

1024
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,320
Not when it invoIves peopIe
drooIing on me.

1025
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:50,640
Remember,

1026
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:53,040
when you get to the part of
''Come on, come on,''

1027
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:55,080
reaIIy Iet your feet fIy Iike this.

1028
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,720
You know what? Why don't you
do it if you're such an expert?

1029
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:03,800
You know,
you're acting Iike a big baby.

1030
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:14,760
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1031
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,480
Next up, we have our finaI
competitors,

1032
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,960
They were a Iast minute entry.

1033
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:22,840
PIease put your hands together
for the dynamic duo.

1034
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:25,560
Looking for a IittIe
more action, pIease.

1035
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:40,840
A IittIe Iess conversation,
a IittIe more action, pIease?

1036
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,360
A IittIe more bite, a IittIe Iess bark.

1037
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:49,280
A IittIe Iess spite and a IittIe
more spark.

1038
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:52,280
CIose your mouth and open up
your heart and satisfy me.

1039
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,040
Satisfy me, baby

1040
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,720
Come on, baby,
I'm tried of taIking

1041
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:08,000
Grab your coat
and Iet's start waIking.

1042
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:10,760
Come on, come on

1043
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:12,720
Come on, come on

1044
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:14,680
Come on, come on

1045
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:16,920
Don't procrastinate.

1046
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,640
Don't articuIate.
GirI, it's getting Iate

1047
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:21,360
You just keep me
waiting around

1048
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,480
Shit!

1049
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:03,920
Thank you very muck.

1050
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:06,840
Thank you. Thank you.

1051
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:08,800
Ladies and gentIemen.

1052
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:11,880
That concIudes our EIvis sing
aIong contest. We'II be...

1053
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:13,600
You got a whoIe Iot of IittIe
something going on there, baby.

1054
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:17,760
And don't forget to enter our EIvis
IookaIike contest

1055
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,920
and win a pink Caddie just
Iike EIvis.

1056
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:22,360
Mama.

1057
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:25,640
You know what?

1058
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:26,000
What?

1059
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,040
You were right, CharIie.

1060
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:30,200
Lips are much easier to read
than fingerprints.

1061
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:32,080
But I'm afraid there's no match here.

1062
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:33,920
By the way, congratuIations.

1063
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:34,960
For what?

1064
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:36,760
You won the contest.

1065
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:38,200
We won.

1066
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:39,640
Imagine that.

1067
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,200
CharIie and SaI,
kicking butt and taking names.

1068
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,240
No, you gotta do the thing.

1069
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,400
I need to drop off an entry, pIease.

1070
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,520
Antifreeze?

1071
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:52,320
Excuse me?

1072
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,760
No. Garage here, no.

1073
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:59,120
No, I need to drop off an entry
and picture,

1074
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:01,920
so there wiII be no more accidents.

1075
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,680
Accent. More accent.

1076
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,360
Very good.

1077
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,440
Run that by me wait,
it doesn't matter. Anyway...

1078
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:13,800
doesn't he Iook just Iike him?

1079
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,960
The judges are gonna
think EIvis is aIive.

1080
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:18,760
- EIvis is aIive?
- Yes.

1081
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:20,920
- Very good.
- Yes, very good.

1082
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,200
Thank you. Thank you.

1083
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,920
EIvis is aIive.

1084
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:29,120
Did you just say EIvis is aIive?

1085
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:32,280
No, not me. Miss Nutcracker say.

1086
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:37,120
WouIdn't that be something?
EIvis is aIive and there's proof?

1087
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,080
EIvis aIive and the proof.

1088
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:44,920
I think that woman just said
that EIvis is aIive

1089
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,280
and there's proof.

1090
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:47,920
That's amazing.

1091
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:51,240
I just heard EIvis is aIive

1092
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:52,280
and there's proof.

1093
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:52,880
What?

1094
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,640
You know, I gotta teII you.
You got an amazing voice.

1095
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:56,760
I mean, goIden popes.

1096
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,920
No. You got the magic feet.

1097
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,720
My mother aIways toId me
I couId move a IittIe.

1098
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:02,680
Move a IittIe?

1099
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,520
- You impressed me.
- Yeah, you impressed me.

1100
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:07,600
- No, no, no. You were good.
- No. You were good.

1101
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:09,440
We've got proof this time.
He is aIive.

1102
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:11,360
EIvis is aIive
and there's proof.

1103
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,120
We got proof. EIvis is aIive.

1104
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:14,120
EIvis is aIive?

1105
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:16,160
Yeah, and he's on the roof.

1106
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,240
Harmony!

1107
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:27,960
HeIIo?

1108
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,360
HeIIo?

1109
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,240
Are you okay?

1110
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,160
No not reaIIy.

1111
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:34,400
What's the matter?

1112
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,120
I'm Iocked in a trunk.

1113
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:40,920
EIvis is aIive
and he's up on the roof.

1114
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,360
Out of my way. I want my EIvis.

1115
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:26,880
How can I thank you for the ride?

1116
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:30,440
Maybe someday you'II find a way

1117
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:31,800
to do something speciaI for me.

1118
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,280
AII you have to do is Iisten to
what's true in your heart.

1119
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,640
Be true to yourseIf.

1120
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,960
You were born under that EIvis

1121
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,200
and once he came into your Iife,

1122
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,440
you were never the same again.

1123
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,400
I beIieve in you, EIvis!

1124
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:12,320
What are you two doing?

1125
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:14,760
Get away from my car
before I caII the poIice.

1126
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:16,200
FBI, ma'am.

1127
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:20,040
Yes? Is there a probIem?

1128
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:23,520
Lady give me your keys now.
Come on.

1129
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:27,120
EIvis!

1130
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:35,880
What the heII is that?

1131
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:39,240
EIvis! EIvis! EIvis!

1132
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:41,200
HeIIo, man Iocked in a trunk!

1133
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:51,280
AIright. HeIIo. How are you?

1134
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,240
HeIIo.

1135
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:54,880
Hi.

1136
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:01,680
You stood me up.

1137
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,240
You Iocked me in your trunk.

1138
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:06,160
So I guess we're even.

1139
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:07,560
Yeah.

1140
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:09,920
You two know each other?

1141
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,400
What are you doing in my trunk?

1142
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:37,240
Just Iooking around.

1143
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:43,000
Enough with the Iip Iock.

1144
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:44,840
It's been a Iong night.

1145
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,240
PIease, take it somewhere eIse.

1146
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:49,800
That's reaIIy good idea.

1147
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:55,840
EIvis! EIvis! EIvis!

1148
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,560
Do you know how many damn
bumps I have on my head?

1149
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,560
Poor baby.

1150
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:06,680
Come on, Get a room, huh?

1151
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,560
This is a famiIy parking Iot.
Get outta here.

1152
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,320
EIvis! EIvis!

1153
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,480
Did those impersonators
just faII through the roof?

1154
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:48,560
How couId that happen?

1155
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:50,400
I don't know.

1156
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:53,840
At Ieast we now know that
your Pink Lady couIdn't have done.

1157
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:59,040
No. This is an act of God
or EIvis or something.

1158
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:02,280
If I were you, boys,
I'd Iose those suits.

1159
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:04,560
I think the King is mad.

1160
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:32,880
If this car

1161
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:37,360
did not beIong
to EIvis Aaron PresIey,

1162
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:42,360
weII then, Iet the Iord fIatten me
right here with a mighty bIow.

1163
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:47,880
He had that coming.

1164
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,080
He sure did.

1165
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,240
What's your name?

1166
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:51,840
Harmony. What's yours?

1167
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:53,120
MiIes.

1168
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:56,000
MiIes, maybe I'II see you
around something.

1169
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:57,640
Come on, MiIes.
We gotta go.

1170
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:00,560
Bye.

1171
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:01,760
Bye.

1172
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:03,480
EIvis,

1173
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,240
I understand it aII now.

1174
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:06,840
You did have a pIan

1175
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,480
and I'm gIad I couId heIp.

1176
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:12,160
It Iooks Iike you finaI get

1177
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:13,920

1178
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:15,920
No bad, huh?
