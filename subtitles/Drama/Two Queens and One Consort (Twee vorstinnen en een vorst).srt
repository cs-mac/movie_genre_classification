1
00:02:53,616 --> 00:02:56,368
OK, kid, out loud now,
so as I can hear you.

2
00:02:56,494 --> 00:02:59,744
I'm checkin' the passengers,
front and back.

3
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:04,747
Shuttin' the doors. Rear section first.
Then the front section.

4
00:03:04,877 --> 00:03:09,668
And the doors are closed. I'm checkin'
indicators to make sure doors are locked.

5
00:03:09,798 --> 00:03:14,839
I remove my key, go back out the window
to make sure no one's bein' dragged.

6
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:26,976
51st Street next stop.
Next stop, 51st Street.

7
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,480
How'd I do?

8
00:04:12,232 --> 00:04:14,224
Now you take my advice, kid.

9
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:18,736
You serve your six months, and
then you put in for the motorman.

10
00:04:18,864 --> 00:04:21,318
Watch it now, we're comin' in.

11
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:23,941
- 59th Street.
- No, it ain't.

12
00:04:24,077 --> 00:04:27,326
51st Street.
Sorry, this station is 51st Street.

13
00:04:27,454 --> 00:04:29,163
Never say you're sorry.

14
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,990
Someone may come back here
and hit you in your damn nose!

15
00:04:42,844 --> 00:04:45,880
Grand Central Station next stop.
Next stop, Grand Central.

16
00:04:46,014 --> 00:04:49,881
If I was you I'd start studyin' for
that motorman exam right now.

17
00:04:50,101 --> 00:04:53,304
Tell you the truth, Mr Mattson,
I have been.

18
00:04:53,438 --> 00:04:56,604
Every car in the IRT is 72 feet long.

19
00:04:56,732 --> 00:05:00,066
Costs $ 150,000, weighs 75,000Ibs.

20
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:21,332
This is where I get off. You're doin' fine.

21
00:05:21,464 --> 00:05:22,839
Yeah, I'll see ya.

22
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:34,392
Hey, what's the rush, chief?
We ain't gonna leave without ya!

23
00:05:39,064 --> 00:05:42,100
33rd Street next stop. Next stop is 33rd.

24
00:06:34,492 --> 00:06:38,619
What's wrong, dude?
Ain't you never seen a sunset before?

25
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,714
Hey! How am I supposed
to see with you...?

26
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:46,597
- Holy God! What do you want?
- I'm taking your train.

27
00:07:48,728 --> 00:07:50,602
You're takin' my train?

28
00:07:57,028 --> 00:07:57,976
Hey!

29
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:00,519
Turn around.
I got s-s-somethin' to show ya.

30
00:08:00,656 --> 00:08:02,565
- What's goin' on?
- Shut up!

31
00:08:02,908 --> 00:08:07,155
I won't tell you again. Open the door
or I'll blow your head off.

32
00:08:25,721 --> 00:08:27,927
May I get by, please?

33
00:08:28,056 --> 00:08:30,726
No, you don't wanna go in there.

34
00:08:30,851 --> 00:08:33,092
Suppose I do anyway?

35
00:08:34,354 --> 00:08:36,892
Then I'll shoot your pee-pee off.

36
00:08:39,317 --> 00:08:43,695
Now just go back out the window
and tell me what you see.

37
00:08:44,531 --> 00:08:46,653
Someone leanin' against the head car.

38
00:08:46,783 --> 00:08:50,827
The second he comes aboard,
you sh-sh-shut the doors.

39
00:09:01,422 --> 00:09:04,422
Keep your hand off
the microphone, buddy.

40
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:07,919
- All right, Mr Green?
- 100 per cent, Mr Blue.

41
00:09:08,053 --> 00:09:10,092
Get moving, will you?

42
00:09:44,503 --> 00:09:45,702
Oh!

43
00:09:45,838 --> 00:09:49,421
Shelley, give that to the meathead
upstairs, will ya?

44
00:09:49,551 --> 00:09:51,958
Right this way. Just follow me.

45
00:09:52,094 --> 00:09:55,298
Shelley, have you seen
Lieutenant Garber?

46
00:09:55,431 --> 00:09:59,511
Oh! Lieutenant, it's so nice of you
to leave your duties long enough

47
00:09:59,643 --> 00:10:02,976
to escort our distinguished
guests around the facilities.

48
00:10:03,105 --> 00:10:05,643
May I present to you Mr Yashimura.

49
00:10:06,442 --> 00:10:08,683
Mr Matsumoto.

50
00:10:09,694 --> 00:10:11,734
Mr Tomashita.

51
00:10:12,823 --> 00:10:16,986
And Mr Naka... Nakabashi?

52
00:10:17,827 --> 00:10:22,156
These gentlemen are all directors of
the Tokyo Metropolitan Subway System.

53
00:10:22,832 --> 00:10:26,081
Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet
Lieutenant Zachary Garber

54
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,997
of our own New York
Transit Authority Police.

55
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,168
A pleasure, gentlemen.

56
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,332
When you're finished, send them up to 13.

57
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:37,468
The chairman would like to say
goodbye to them personally.

58
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,635
Sayonara!

59
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:46,520
Follow me, gentlemen. New York City
Subway is the largest in the world,

60
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:50,145
with 237 miles of track, 7,000...

61
00:10:55,612 --> 00:11:00,109
Gentlemen, please. New York City
Subway is the largest in the world.

62
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:03,575
7,000 cars, 237 miles of track...

63
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:14,662
- Say "when", Mr Blue.
- You just keep going, will you?

64
00:11:31,146 --> 00:11:35,393
You're still in switchin'. Why don't you
peg it up? You're green all the way.

65
00:11:35,526 --> 00:11:37,981
We're in no hurry. Atchoo!

66
00:11:39,154 --> 00:11:41,610
Your cold sounds pretty bad.

67
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,409
I woke up in the middle
of the night with it.

68
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,530
- What happened?
- Must've bucked.

69
00:11:48,662 --> 00:11:51,035
You told me you could drive this thing.

70
00:11:51,165 --> 00:11:54,534
It's the train. She bucks
all the time. She's a dog.

71
00:11:54,918 --> 00:11:57,836
This is the headquarters
of the Transit Police,

72
00:11:57,963 --> 00:12:01,663
which occupies the entire
second floor of this building.

73
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,007
We call it the nerve centre.

74
00:12:04,136 --> 00:12:07,089
The status board pinpoints the disposition

75
00:12:07,222 --> 00:12:11,350
of every Transit Authority patrolman
presently in the field.

76
00:12:11,976 --> 00:12:14,646
That's it. Get a good shot of that.

77
00:12:16,314 --> 00:12:19,729
Things are usually jumpin'
pretty good in here.

78
00:12:21,903 --> 00:12:27,063
I suppose you gentlemen have your share
of crime in the Tokyo subways, right?

79
00:12:28,534 --> 00:12:32,199
Right? Well, that's the way it goes.

80
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:37,370
These are the assignment desks. One
for each of the lines: the BMT, the IRT,

81
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,327
the IND.

82
00:12:39,461 --> 00:12:41,500
There's our artist in residence.

83
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:45,793
And right through here is our operations
lieutenant, Mr Rico Patrone,

84
00:12:45,925 --> 00:12:48,131
who, on weekends, works for the Mafia.

85
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,879
Rico, I'd like you to meet some
good friends of the chairman.

86
00:12:52,015 --> 00:12:54,884
- Hiya.
- Very good friends, Rico.

87
00:12:55,017 --> 00:12:56,215
Hiya.

88
00:12:56,352 --> 00:13:00,563
Rico, these are the directors
of the Tokyo subway.

89
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:07,065
Tell us about some of the excitin' things

90
00:13:07,195 --> 00:13:11,109
that have happened in the New York City
Subway System lately, Rico.

91
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,692
Well, we had a bomb scare
in the Bronx yesterday.

92
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:17,496
But it turned out to be a cantaloupe.

93
00:13:21,751 --> 00:13:24,122
I'm busy, Zach, OK?

94
00:13:25,045 --> 00:13:26,754
In the course of a normal week,

95
00:13:26,881 --> 00:13:32,467
the average TA policeman deals with
such crimes as robbery, assault,

96
00:13:32,594 --> 00:13:35,678
murder, drunkenness,

97
00:13:35,805 --> 00:13:38,593
illness, vandalism,

98
00:13:38,725 --> 00:13:40,219
mishegaas,

99
00:13:40,351 --> 00:13:44,301
abusiveness, sexual molestation,

100
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:45,684
exhibitionism...

101
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,778
- What's your name, motorman?
- Denny Doyle, sir.

102
00:13:51,904 --> 00:13:53,943
- Ever been written up?
- Once.

103
00:13:54,073 --> 00:13:56,944
- What for?
- Runnin' a red signal. How about you?

104
00:13:57,076 --> 00:14:00,029
Twice. Once on the Canarsie...

105
00:14:00,162 --> 00:14:04,491
That's right, Mr Green. Tell Mr Doyle
all about yourself, will you?

106
00:14:06,877 --> 00:14:08,786
OK. Stop it about here.

107
00:14:14,175 --> 00:14:18,801
I'm takin' your brake handle
and the reverse key, Denny.

108
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,044
Atchoo!

109
00:14:20,181 --> 00:14:22,636
I want your cuttin' key also.

110
00:14:24,393 --> 00:14:26,433
That's it.

111
00:14:28,146 --> 00:14:30,898
You'll hear from Command Centre
in a minute or two.

112
00:14:31,024 --> 00:14:33,941
You will ignore the call.
Is that clear, Mr Doyle?

113
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:36,607
Yes, sir. They can call
all they want. I'm deaf.

114
00:14:39,407 --> 00:14:42,776
- Thanks, Mr Grey.
- Don't mention it, uh... Mr Green, right?

115
00:14:42,911 --> 00:14:46,528
Right. Let's have your cab key, conductor.

116
00:14:46,664 --> 00:14:49,036
I can't do that. I ain't supposed to do that.

117
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:53,460
You got three seconds
to live, conductor. One, two...

118
00:14:53,587 --> 00:14:55,627
OK, OK, OK.

119
00:14:56,257 --> 00:14:59,957
It'll mean my job.
What's he gonna do?

120
00:15:00,094 --> 00:15:04,173
You wouldn't want me to spoil
the s-s-surprise, would you?

121
00:15:04,556 --> 00:15:07,890
Until then, stay where you are.
Go back to normal speed when...

122
00:15:11,563 --> 00:15:15,690
Command Centre callin' Pelham
One Two Three. Come in, please.

123
00:15:16,859 --> 00:15:19,101
Sorry, I couldn't help it. It was automatic.

124
00:15:19,237 --> 00:15:21,525
Pelham One Two Three, do you read me?

125
00:15:22,781 --> 00:15:24,821
Come in, Pelham One Two Three.

126
00:15:26,535 --> 00:15:28,574
Where the fuck are you?

127
00:15:28,704 --> 00:15:31,491
Hey! What's the goddamn hurry?

128
00:15:31,624 --> 00:15:35,455
I told you, one of my men dropped
his weddin' ring down the john!

129
00:15:35,585 --> 00:15:38,502
- What are you runnin' for?
- Who's runnin'?

130
00:15:40,215 --> 00:15:43,750
- How come that gate ain't locked?
- Who's gonna steal a subway train?

131
00:15:43,884 --> 00:15:46,210
Grand Central Tower
callin' Command Centre.

132
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:49,133
Have you picked up on
Pelham One Two Three yet?

133
00:15:49,265 --> 00:15:51,008
We're tryin' to find out.

134
00:15:51,141 --> 00:15:54,392
- What'd he say?
- They're backed up all along the line.

135
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,686
Jesus Christ, Caz, you picked
a hell of a day to be late!

136
00:15:57,814 --> 00:16:00,103
You wanted a plumber
down here, didn't ya?

137
00:16:00,234 --> 00:16:03,851
- Whose goddamn weddin' ring was it?
- Mrs Jenkins'. But, Caz...

138
00:16:03,987 --> 00:16:06,313
Sorry, Mr Dolowicz. It just slipped off.

139
00:16:06,448 --> 00:16:09,947
- Why was your hand in the john anyway?
- My hand wasn't...

140
00:16:10,076 --> 00:16:13,161
Go fish it out, would ya?
The toilet's behind the board.

141
00:16:13,288 --> 00:16:15,695
Caz, listen to me! There's a train down!

142
00:16:15,832 --> 00:16:18,786
Classification's been open
to a woman for only a month

143
00:16:18,918 --> 00:16:21,669
and already we're in a goddamn toilet!

144
00:16:23,506 --> 00:16:27,419
- What the hell's that?
- Marino's been tryin' to tell ya.

145
00:16:27,551 --> 00:16:29,923
He's layin' down between 28th and 23rd.

146
00:16:30,054 --> 00:16:33,802
- What the hell for? How long?
- Three minutes.

147
00:16:33,932 --> 00:16:37,680
Command Centre's been tryin' to raise
him, but he don't answer his phone.

148
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:40,977
Jeez, Caz, why don't he answer his radio?

149
00:16:41,106 --> 00:16:42,932
Maybe his radio's busted

150
00:16:43,065 --> 00:16:46,600
and the son of a bitch is too lazy
to climb down and use the phone.

151
00:16:46,736 --> 00:16:50,021
I'm gonna write him up for this!
I'm gonna have his ass!

152
00:17:03,335 --> 00:17:05,043
Hey, it's movin'.

153
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:09,298
For Jesus Christ's sake,
the dumb bastard is movin' backwards.

154
00:17:09,424 --> 00:17:11,583
Look. He left the front car behind.

155
00:17:11,718 --> 00:17:14,837
The goddamn board must be busted.

156
00:17:20,142 --> 00:17:21,553
He stopped again.

157
00:17:22,061 --> 00:17:24,978
Well, stopped is better
than backwards at least.

158
00:17:26,273 --> 00:17:29,393
What was that? I didn't know
these things went backwards.

159
00:17:29,527 --> 00:17:31,234
Now you know.

160
00:17:34,781 --> 00:17:38,114
Would you mind tellin' me
what you gentlemen are doing?

161
00:17:38,243 --> 00:17:40,282
Yeah, I would.

162
00:18:03,058 --> 00:18:05,513
Come in, Pelham One Two Three.
Come in.

163
00:18:05,643 --> 00:18:08,134
- All right, Mr Green?
- Smooth as silk, Mr Blue.

164
00:18:08,271 --> 00:18:09,931
- How do you feel?
- Great.

165
00:18:10,065 --> 00:18:11,393
Get out, Doyle.

166
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:15,189
Here's your gun. Get going.
We're already two minutes late.

167
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,902
Pelham One Two Three.
Do you hear me, Pelham One Two Three?

168
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:26,076
Look. The front car's movin'.
And forward this time.

169
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,905
- I've got eyes, haven't I?
- What's goin' on down there?

170
00:18:30,584 --> 00:18:32,623
Are you children with anybody?

171
00:18:32,753 --> 00:18:35,124
You children... you with anybody?

172
00:18:35,254 --> 00:18:37,294
Yeah. My mother.

173
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,091
Go back and join her.

174
00:18:40,218 --> 00:18:43,053
- Why?
- Go back and join your mother.

175
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:45,219
Mom, we wanna play.

176
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,618
Your attention, please.

177
00:19:11,622 --> 00:19:16,580
You'll all remain seated. Anybody
who tries to rise is going to get shot.

178
00:19:21,174 --> 00:19:23,165
There's another one!

179
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,008
Shut up!

180
00:19:25,135 --> 00:19:27,175
Move up a bit, Mr Doyle.

181
00:19:28,722 --> 00:19:31,047
Ladies and gentlemen, you see this gun?

182
00:19:31,183 --> 00:19:34,681
It fires 750 rounds of 9-millimetre
ammunition per minute.

183
00:19:34,811 --> 00:19:39,023
In other words, if all of you
simultaneously were to rush me,

184
00:19:40,107 --> 00:19:44,319
not a single one of you would get
any closer than you are right now.

185
00:19:44,445 --> 00:19:46,318
Mom, are those real guns?

186
00:19:47,156 --> 00:19:50,027
I do hope I have made myself understood.

187
00:20:10,344 --> 00:20:14,722
He stopped again. The crazy dumb-ass
son of a bitch stopped again.

188
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:16,971
He's halfway between stations!

189
00:20:17,101 --> 00:20:20,636
I'm gonna nail his pecker
to the goddamn wall for this.

190
00:20:20,772 --> 00:20:23,440
- Caz, take it easy, will ya?
- Come on!

191
00:20:23,565 --> 00:20:27,563
If I gotta watch my language because
they let a few broads in, I'm gonna quit!

192
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:30,695
How can you run a goddamn railroad
without swearin'?!

193
00:20:30,822 --> 00:20:34,155
Grand Central Terminal,
who's in charge down there?

194
00:20:34,284 --> 00:20:36,526
It's for you, Mr Dolowicz.

195
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:42,697
It's me, Frank. Caz Dolowicz.
We're watchin' it on the board.

196
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:45,502
Watchin' it?!
I got trains pilin' up behind it!

197
00:20:45,628 --> 00:20:49,673
- Get some supervision down there!
- It's on its way, Frank.

198
00:20:50,757 --> 00:20:51,753
I'll be back.

199
00:20:55,805 --> 00:20:58,259
I've turned off the power.

200
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,258
Everybody in this part of the car,
move to the back.

201
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:06,854
Come on. Everybody in the front part
of the car move to the back.

202
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:12,523
- What the hell is goin' on?
- Move back, please, and sit down.

203
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,317
May I say something, please?

204
00:21:18,117 --> 00:21:22,114
- Please, listen to me...
- Be quiet and sit down!

205
00:21:22,746 --> 00:21:24,786
Let's go, honey.

206
00:21:26,374 --> 00:21:28,414
All right, Mr Doyle.

207
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,000
What are you gonna do?

208
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:34,246
- What about this one?
- Let her sleep.

209
00:21:34,382 --> 00:21:37,170
What you're going to do, Mr Doyle,
is to go back,

210
00:21:37,302 --> 00:21:40,635
collect all the passengers
from the cars we've cut loose,

211
00:21:40,763 --> 00:21:43,929
and walk them to 28th Street station.

212
00:21:44,058 --> 00:21:47,593
- People hate to get off in a tunnel...
- Just do as you're told.

213
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:56,400
Excuse me.

214
00:21:56,528 --> 00:22:00,989
Excuse me. Can I go with him? I got
this very important appointment to see.

215
00:22:01,116 --> 00:22:03,155
Nobody else leaves.

216
00:22:03,868 --> 00:22:05,197
Aw, shit.

217
00:22:07,414 --> 00:22:10,747
I'm sure you wouldn't mind
if the children were to go.

218
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:14,919
Sit down, madam. Didn't you hear
what I said? I said nobody else leaves.

219
00:22:15,045 --> 00:22:19,257
Excuse me, mister. Don't you think
we should be let in on what's happening?

220
00:22:19,383 --> 00:22:24,378
You're being held by four very dangerous
men armed with machine guns.

221
00:22:24,513 --> 00:22:26,220
Ask a foolish question...

222
00:22:27,891 --> 00:22:29,433
Be quiet.

223
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,343
Be quiet! Nothing will happen
as long as you obey my orders.

224
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,856
That's what they said in Vietnam,
and I still got my ass shot full of lead.

225
00:22:37,984 --> 00:22:39,811
Shut your mouth, nigger!

226
00:22:42,572 --> 00:22:45,145
- And keep it shut.
- Mr Grey!

227
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:03,671
It's terrible.

228
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:06,382
Who asked you to look?

229
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,632
All right, Mr Green?

230
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:13,600
The power's off at 14th Street and 33rd.

231
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:17,938
All four tracks. Local and express.

232
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:20,186
The north and the southbound.

233
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,142
Why am I still seeing lights?

234
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:25,146
That's emergency.
They run on AC like the signals.

235
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,192
Atchoo!

236
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,029
- Stop that, will you?
- Sorry.

237
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:30,031
Command Centre calling Pelham.

238
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:35,615
Did you cut off the power down there?
Without callin' to explain? Listen to me.

239
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:39,415
You've screwed up the
whole subway system.

240
00:23:43,504 --> 00:23:46,209
Gentlemen, this is
the TA Command Centre.

241
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,665
A lot of laughs in here. Terrific place.

242
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:53,629
Each train is identified by the name of
its terminus and the time of its departure.

243
00:23:53,763 --> 00:23:59,470
Thus an express train leavin' Woodlawn
at 6.30pm would be Woodlawn 6-3-0.

244
00:23:59,603 --> 00:24:05,226
While on its return trip its destination
might be... let's say Flatbush 8-2-5.

245
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:09,854
- I hope you're memorisin' all this junk.
- Garber, what's the matter with you?

246
00:24:09,988 --> 00:24:12,276
Don't worry.
They don't understand English.

247
00:24:12,406 --> 00:24:14,862
This way, dummies.
Step this way, dummies.

248
00:24:14,992 --> 00:24:21,161
Over here is Frank Correll, the Lord Byron
of the New York City Subway System.

249
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:24,076
Observe the way fire and smoke
shoot out of his ears.

250
00:24:24,209 --> 00:24:26,700
Don't bug me, Garber. I got troubles here.

251
00:24:26,837 --> 00:24:30,916
A train is down, its radio's dead,
the power's off, and it's dumped its load.

252
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:32,923
Aside from that, it's ginger-peachy.

253
00:24:36,095 --> 00:24:38,088
What time is it, Mr Green?

254
00:24:38,223 --> 00:24:40,097
Uh...

255
00:24:40,225 --> 00:24:42,300
2.10.

256
00:24:46,773 --> 00:24:50,022
Right. Time to talk to them.

257
00:24:51,694 --> 00:24:54,778
- Is something troubling you?
- I think I'm gonna die today.

258
00:24:54,905 --> 00:24:56,814
That's entirely possible.

259
00:25:02,037 --> 00:25:04,528
This is Pelham One Two Three
to Command Centre.

260
00:25:04,664 --> 00:25:08,531
This is Pelham One Two Three to
Command Centre. Do you read me?

261
00:25:08,668 --> 00:25:11,205
OK, we'll leave him alone to his problems.

262
00:25:11,337 --> 00:25:15,121
What are you tryin' to do?
Screw up this entire railroad?

263
00:25:15,258 --> 00:25:19,125
- I want an explanation! It better be good!
- Your train has been taken.

264
00:25:19,762 --> 00:25:22,632
- What?
- Repeat, your train has been taken.

265
00:25:22,764 --> 00:25:25,635
Hey, shut up in here! Shut up!

266
00:25:25,767 --> 00:25:27,891
I said shut it, everybody!

267
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,641
Shut it up, everybody, goddamnit!

268
00:25:31,356 --> 00:25:33,313
The train has been taken?

269
00:25:33,442 --> 00:25:35,398
- Are you the motorman?
- Negative.

270
00:25:35,526 --> 00:25:40,188
Nobody's authorised to be in that cab
except the motorman. Identify yourself.

271
00:25:40,948 --> 00:25:46,025
Your locomotive has been hijacked
by a group of heavily armed men.

272
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:51,999
It what?

273
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:56,704
We are holding 17 passengers and
the conductor hostage in the first car.

274
00:25:57,548 --> 00:26:00,501
I am quite prepared to kill any
or all of them

275
00:26:00,634 --> 00:26:03,172
if you do not obey my commands
to the letter.

276
00:26:03,303 --> 00:26:07,431
- Have I made myself quite clear?
- You're outta your skull!

277
00:26:07,557 --> 00:26:11,506
Be that as it may, get out a pen,
take down our list of demands.

278
00:26:11,852 --> 00:26:14,640
Hey, now wait a minute.
Hold on. Stand by.

279
00:26:14,772 --> 00:26:17,523
Why would anybody hijack
a goddamn subway train?

280
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:21,233
Hit your six button, Frank.
I want the TA police in on this.

281
00:26:21,361 --> 00:26:23,935
What are all these Chinamen
doin' in here?

282
00:26:24,072 --> 00:26:25,567
Holy Christ, I forgot.

283
00:26:25,699 --> 00:26:28,189
Charlie, take these monkeys up to 13.

284
00:26:28,326 --> 00:26:33,616
It is all right, Lieutenant Garber.
I am sure we can find it by ourselves.

285
00:26:37,043 --> 00:26:39,913
Thank you for a most
instructive visit, Lieutenant.

286
00:26:40,045 --> 00:26:43,000
A most exciting tour, Lieutenant.
Most exciting.

287
00:26:43,132 --> 00:26:45,171
Most exciting.

288
00:26:53,225 --> 00:26:55,265
Garber to Patrone. Garber to Patrone.

289
00:26:56,228 --> 00:26:58,267
Come in, Patrone.

290
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,105
This is Patrone.

291
00:27:00,232 --> 00:27:04,858
Rico, I want you to plug everythin' you got
into the IRTtrain master's circuit.

292
00:27:04,986 --> 00:27:07,228
And all units stand by on the double.

293
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:11,361
Call in the City cops. Put it on a 911
so their computer gets it.

294
00:27:11,492 --> 00:27:12,987
What's up, Z?

295
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:15,905
- You won't believe it.
- I'll believe anythin'.

296
00:27:16,038 --> 00:27:18,576
A train's been hijacked.

297
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:20,538
I don't believe it.

298
00:27:34,639 --> 00:27:36,347
When did the power go?

299
00:27:36,474 --> 00:27:39,475
- Conductor, when did the power go?
- Who wants to know?

300
00:27:39,602 --> 00:27:43,018
Me! The supervisor of the Grand
Central Tower wants to know!

301
00:27:43,147 --> 00:27:47,014
Oh, yes, sir! A couple of minutes ago!
Hey, what happened down there?

302
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:49,648
Who wants to know!

303
00:27:49,903 --> 00:27:51,278
No, nobody's hurt!

304
00:27:51,405 --> 00:27:54,276
- What's goin' on?
- I don't know what's goin' on!

305
00:27:54,408 --> 00:27:56,614
- What happened?
- Nothin' happened, lady.

306
00:27:56,743 --> 00:27:58,534
- Anybody killed?
- Nobody's killed.

307
00:28:04,167 --> 00:28:07,582
On the left now, watch out for
the third rail. On the left now.

308
00:28:09,463 --> 00:28:12,251
What the hell is this, for Christ's sake?

309
00:28:15,177 --> 00:28:18,048
Your attention, please,
ladies and gentlemen.

310
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:22,391
I'm sure the more intelligent of you
have worked out you're all hostages.

311
00:28:22,518 --> 00:28:24,557
Oh, my God!

312
00:28:25,979 --> 00:28:28,019
Isn't that wonderful

313
00:28:28,356 --> 00:28:31,191
- Hostages.
- What did you think? Guests?

314
00:28:31,317 --> 00:28:34,022
When we get what we want,
you'll be released unharmed.

315
00:28:34,154 --> 00:28:37,688
Until then, you'll continue to do
precisely as you're told.

316
00:28:43,162 --> 00:28:47,658
Excuse me, sir. What's going to happen
to us if you don't get what you want?

317
00:28:48,042 --> 00:28:52,253
Excuse me, sir. We are going
to get what we want.

318
00:28:55,131 --> 00:28:57,457
I don't give a damn
what they were armed with.

319
00:28:57,592 --> 00:28:59,669
They were gonna kill me!

320
00:28:59,803 --> 00:29:04,714
You're like the captain of the ship!
You're supposed to go down with it!

321
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:07,470
- Horseshit!
- Oh, lady, butt out!

322
00:29:07,935 --> 00:29:11,387
Tell Command Centre
I'll be on my way to investigate!

323
00:29:11,523 --> 00:29:14,558
I wouldn't go
down there if I was you!

324
00:29:14,692 --> 00:29:16,731
I know you wouldn't!

325
00:29:17,987 --> 00:29:23,229
You work for the subway, mister? Tell 'em
I'm gonna sue! I'm gonna sue their ass off!

326
00:29:30,373 --> 00:29:32,247
Pelham One Two Three
to Command Centre.

327
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:35,871
Are you ready to take down
our list of demands?

328
00:29:36,004 --> 00:29:38,043
What do you want?

329
00:29:38,172 --> 00:29:40,628
- Do you have your pen?
- Go on, for Pete's sake!

330
00:29:42,176 --> 00:29:44,548
It's important you understand
three things.

331
00:29:44,678 --> 00:29:47,928
1) Pelham One Two Three is
completely within our control.

332
00:29:48,056 --> 00:29:50,594
2) We are all armed with
automatic weapons.

333
00:29:50,726 --> 00:29:53,347
3) We have no scruples about killing.

334
00:29:53,479 --> 00:29:57,690
- Do you understand me so far?
- I understand you fine, you lunatic.

335
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:01,352
Inform the mayor that we demand
one million dollars cash

336
00:30:01,486 --> 00:30:04,273
for the release of the car
and all the hostages.

337
00:30:04,406 --> 00:30:07,821
- That'll be the day.
- The time is now 2.13.

338
00:30:08,034 --> 00:30:10,869
The money must be in our hands
not later than 3.13.

339
00:30:10,995 --> 00:30:12,572
One hour from now.

340
00:30:12,705 --> 00:30:17,532
If the money is not in our hands, we'll kill
one hostage for every minute you're late.

341
00:30:18,961 --> 00:30:20,538
Keep dreamin', maniac.

342
00:30:20,671 --> 00:30:24,288
If anybody attempts to interfere
- anyone, in any way -

343
00:30:24,424 --> 00:30:27,259
we will begin killing the hostages
immediately.

344
00:30:28,178 --> 00:30:29,340
Confirm, please.

345
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,130
Zach! Zach!

346
00:30:31,264 --> 00:30:34,847
- Pelham One Two Three, come in, please.
- This is Pelham.

347
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:37,307
Identify yourself, please.

348
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:42,857
This is Lieutenant Zachary Garber of the
Transit Police. Identify yourself, please.

349
00:30:42,983 --> 00:30:44,941
I'm the man who stole your train.

350
00:30:45,069 --> 00:30:49,398
Sir, there is no way you can get away with
this. You are underground in a tunnel.

351
00:30:49,531 --> 00:30:51,524
Why concern yourself with that?

352
00:30:52,243 --> 00:30:55,658
At precisely 3.13 we are going
to begin executing the hostages.

353
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:58,492
You'd better contact the mayor
and get back to me

354
00:30:58,624 --> 00:31:01,494
for my further instructions.
Over and out.

355
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:04,626
Son of a bitch has got me backed up
all the way to the Bronx!

356
00:31:04,754 --> 00:31:07,161
What is this, a circus?
Let's get back to work!

357
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:08,840
Rico, did you get that?

358
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:12,335
I only got your end of it,
but I could piece it together. It's crazy.

359
00:31:12,469 --> 00:31:16,846
The guy's got a heavy English accent.
He could be a fruitcake.

360
00:31:16,973 --> 00:31:19,013
We got anybody at 28th Street?

361
00:31:20,352 --> 00:31:23,306
Just checkin' it out.
Yeah, he's around there somewhere.

362
00:31:23,438 --> 00:31:27,139
Tell him to hold the fort. Could be
all day before the City cops show up.

363
00:31:27,276 --> 00:31:29,564
They're never around when you need 'em.

364
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:34,696
Lex 28. Lex 28. Come in, please.

365
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,862
Patrolman James.

366
00:31:36,993 --> 00:31:39,993
This is Lieutenant Patrone.
Where are you?

367
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,780
28th Street, southbound.

368
00:31:41,914 --> 00:31:46,741
Look, Lieutenant, everything's cooled out.
Nothing's happenin'. What's goin' on?

369
00:31:46,877 --> 00:31:50,211
Look, don't react to this,
but a train's been hijacked.

370
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:53,876
- Holy shit.
- For God's sake, don't say anythin'.

371
00:31:54,009 --> 00:31:57,259
There's a supervisor from
Grand Central Tower.

372
00:31:57,388 --> 00:32:01,301
Yeah, I saw him a few minutes ago.
He went down the track on foot.

373
00:32:01,433 --> 00:32:03,923
Go after him.
See if you can turn him back.

374
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,684
Yes, sir.

375
00:32:15,946 --> 00:32:20,655
All I know is I am the goddamn mayor
of the goddamn city of New York,

376
00:32:20,785 --> 00:32:24,568
the second most important
elective office in the entire country,

377
00:32:24,705 --> 00:32:29,165
and you tell me I gotta lay here and suffer
like every other schlub in the country?

378
00:32:29,292 --> 00:32:33,953
I'm sorry you have the flu, Mr Mayor.
There's nothing more I can do.

379
00:32:34,088 --> 00:32:37,457
There's one more thing. Get out!

380
00:32:39,677 --> 00:32:41,716
You can't fight City Hall.

381
00:32:50,312 --> 00:32:51,592
Yeah?

382
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:55,431
Al, it's Warren. I'm comin' upstairs.
I got a real bitch on our hands.

383
00:32:55,567 --> 00:32:58,236
Don't tell me. I don't wanna know.

384
00:32:58,361 --> 00:33:01,861
- I'm comin' up.
- Can't you handle it, Warren?

385
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:04,990
You are the goddamn
deputy mayor of the city of...

386
00:33:05,118 --> 00:33:09,162
Sure I can handle it. Like I handle
every other filthy, stinkin' job

387
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:12,289
in this whole miserable city,
but I'm not gonna do it.

388
00:33:12,416 --> 00:33:14,492
What is it? Another strike?

389
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:17,711
All right, all right.
I can take another strike.

390
00:33:17,838 --> 00:33:20,838
A gang of men has hijacked
a subway train.

391
00:33:21,716 --> 00:33:23,543
A gang of men...?

392
00:33:23,677 --> 00:33:27,970
Has hijacked a subway train.
They want a million dollars for it.

393
00:33:29,724 --> 00:33:31,764
Come on up.

394
00:33:35,605 --> 00:33:40,681
Couple number one are the winners
of today's newlywed gamel

395
00:33:41,193 --> 00:33:42,652
Missed it!

396
00:34:00,712 --> 00:34:02,621
What do you want, Mr Green?

397
00:34:02,755 --> 00:34:04,712
Is everythin' OK?

398
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:09,170
Go and sit down. I do not want Mr Grey
and Mr Brown alone with the passengers.

399
00:34:09,303 --> 00:34:12,055
- Don't you trust them?
- I trust Mr Brown.

400
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:14,678
I do not trust Mr Grey.

401
00:34:14,808 --> 00:34:18,806
I think that Mr Grey is an enormous
arrogant pain in the arse

402
00:34:18,938 --> 00:34:20,894
who could turn out to be trouble.

403
00:34:21,356 --> 00:34:23,396
I also think that he is mad.

404
00:34:24,401 --> 00:34:27,567
Why do you think
they threw him out of the Mafia?

405
00:34:27,696 --> 00:34:29,735
Ohh, terrific.

406
00:34:42,502 --> 00:34:45,288
- Hold it right there, cowboy!
- Who are you?!

407
00:34:45,421 --> 00:34:48,375
You'll find out
if you take another step!

408
00:34:48,507 --> 00:34:53,299
I'm warnin' ya, mister! That's City
property you're foolin' around with!

409
00:34:53,804 --> 00:34:55,297
That's just too fuckin' bad!

410
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:59,048
Why don't you go grab a goddamn
aeroplane like everybody else?

411
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:02,718
Cos we're afraid of flyin'!
Clear out or I'll shoot your ass off!

412
00:35:02,854 --> 00:35:05,475
The hell with you! I'm comin' on board!

413
00:35:06,066 --> 00:35:08,104
I warned you, stupid!

414
00:35:14,114 --> 00:35:16,154
Holy shit!

415
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:23,366
I warned the bastard,
but he kept on comin' anyway.

416
00:35:23,499 --> 00:35:26,582
- Was he alone?
- I didn't see nobody else.

417
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,659
Mr Brown.

418
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:30,794
I guess I got us on the scoreboard, right?

419
00:35:35,009 --> 00:35:36,882
Take over from Mr Grey.

420
00:35:37,011 --> 00:35:40,629
- A little quick with that gun.
- The jerk was comin' on board!

421
00:35:40,765 --> 00:35:42,472
Loved every minute of it.

422
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:45,933
- Keep those children quiet.
- I'm trying! I can't!

423
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:49,181
- Do you want me to try?
- Oh, my God! No!

424
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,642
You said nobody was gonna get hurt.

425
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,936
Patrolman James callin' Operations.

426
00:35:56,947 --> 00:35:59,947
This is Patrone.
Did you find that supervisor?

427
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:04,735
- He's dead, Lieutenant.
- Speak up, will ya? I can't hear ya.

428
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:09,200
I can't. I'm only 20 yards away
from the hijacked train.

429
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,666
They just shot him with a machine gun.

430
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,834
Is he dead?

431
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:19,834
- Wouldn't you be, Lieutenant?
- Stay put and keep an eye on things.

432
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:22,502
Z! They just drew first blood.

433
00:36:22,888 --> 00:36:26,470
That supervisor from Grand Central
Tower. They just killed him.

434
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,050
Oh, my God. Thanks, Rico.

435
00:36:30,186 --> 00:36:32,938
Frank, do you know who went
to 28th from Grand Central?

436
00:36:33,064 --> 00:36:36,682
- Caz Dolowicz. Why?
- Jeez. I knew him.

437
00:36:38,569 --> 00:36:40,692
Hey, whaddaya mean, you knew him?

438
00:36:40,822 --> 00:36:43,110
They just shot him.

439
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,651
Dead?

440
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:47,785
- Caz? Fat Caz?
- Yeah.

441
00:36:48,203 --> 00:36:50,908
- Garber?
- Aw, shit!

442
00:36:51,582 --> 00:36:54,037
Garber? Are you there, Zach?

443
00:36:55,961 --> 00:36:58,000
- Yeah, who is this?
- Costello.

444
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,042
Yes, Captain.

445
00:36:59,171 --> 00:37:02,588
I'm puttin' you in charge at this end.
I'm goin' to headquarters.

446
00:37:02,717 --> 00:37:05,836
If I don't show up,
the City cops'll hog all the action.

447
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,722
There's one on board the train.
One of the hostages.

448
00:37:08,848 --> 00:37:11,765
You're kiddin'. A cop on the train?
How do you know?

449
00:37:12,017 --> 00:37:16,347
There were two, but one got off at 33rd
and called in later when the news got out.

450
00:37:16,479 --> 00:37:19,053
That means the other one's
still on the train.

451
00:37:19,191 --> 00:37:21,943
- Plainclothes?
- Yeah, Tactical Force.

452
00:37:22,069 --> 00:37:26,066
- Man or woman?
- I never even thought to ask.

453
00:37:26,198 --> 00:37:30,325
Well, doesn't make any difference.
They can't do much single-handed.

454
00:37:31,327 --> 00:37:34,945
Warren, I thought it over.
I know what we're gonna do.

455
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:35,994
Tell me.

456
00:37:36,123 --> 00:37:38,994
We're gonna let 'em keep
the goddamn subway train.

457
00:37:39,127 --> 00:37:41,913
We got plenty of them.
We'll never even miss it.

458
00:37:42,046 --> 00:37:44,751
How about the 18 hostages?
We gonna miss them?

459
00:37:44,882 --> 00:37:48,879
Warren, goddamnit!
This city hasn't got a million dollars!

460
00:37:49,011 --> 00:37:52,960
Empty one of your Swiss bank accounts.
There's no other way out.

461
00:37:53,098 --> 00:37:55,767
- Don't we get to think about it?
- There's no time.

462
00:37:55,892 --> 00:37:59,308
I still want the full picture.
Get me the police commissioner,

463
00:37:59,437 --> 00:38:03,482
the chairman of the Transit Authority,
and that putz we got for a comptroller.

464
00:38:03,608 --> 00:38:06,608
They're on their way,
but it's no good runnin' to them, Al.

465
00:38:06,736 --> 00:38:09,523
You're the mayor.
The buck stops with you.

466
00:38:09,655 --> 00:38:12,775
- Oh, shit.
- God help us.

467
00:38:13,242 --> 00:38:15,282
Shit! Piss! Fuck!

468
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:18,699
Call Charlie. Tell him
I'll get to him as soon as I can.

469
00:38:18,831 --> 00:38:20,539
Where's that list on 144?

470
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:23,073
Command Centre callin'
Pelham One Two Three.

471
00:38:23,209 --> 00:38:25,083
Frank, you're hoggin' my circuits.

472
00:38:25,212 --> 00:38:27,666
I've got motormen callin' me from all over!

473
00:38:27,797 --> 00:38:31,000
Tell 'em to get off the air.
I need some more lines open.

474
00:38:31,134 --> 00:38:35,048
So talkin' to murderers takes priority
over runnin' a railroad?

475
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:38,299
My only priority is savin'
the lives of these passengers.

476
00:38:38,433 --> 00:38:42,560
Screw the passengers! What do they
expect for 35 cents? To live for ever?

477
00:38:42,686 --> 00:38:44,679
Oh, you're beautiful.

478
00:38:44,814 --> 00:38:48,811
- Do you read me, Pelham?
- I'd go in with guns and blast 'em out!

479
00:38:48,942 --> 00:38:52,892
Why don't you start doin' your work
and let the police do theirs, huh?

480
00:38:53,029 --> 00:38:56,066
Like that cop on the train.
When's he gonna start shootin'?

481
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:58,025
We don't know if it is a "he".

482
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:01,030
- Do you read me, Pelham?
- Women cops! What good are they?

483
00:39:01,162 --> 00:39:03,913
Probably can't find her gun
in her goddamn purse!

484
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,495
Pelham One Two Three.
Any news to report?

485
00:39:06,626 --> 00:39:09,294
What's that about news?
Say again about news.

486
00:39:09,419 --> 00:39:12,337
I said have you any news to report?

487
00:39:12,965 --> 00:39:15,372
- No, nothin' yet.
- Atchoo!

488
00:39:16,051 --> 00:39:17,795
Gesundheit!

489
00:39:17,928 --> 00:39:21,213
- What are you calling about?
- Pelham, we need more time.

490
00:39:21,347 --> 00:39:23,387
Shut the door, please.

491
00:39:25,435 --> 00:39:28,768
It is 2.24, Lieutenant.
You've got 49 minutes left.

492
00:39:28,897 --> 00:39:31,435
Be reasonable.
We're tryin' to cooperate,

493
00:39:31,566 --> 00:39:34,851
but we can't do anything
if you don't give us enough time.

494
00:39:34,986 --> 00:39:36,184
49 minutes.

495
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,855
We're dealin' with City Hall. You know
what a mess of red tape that is?

496
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:41,235
49 minutes.

497
00:39:41,867 --> 00:39:44,405
Look, fella, we know how to tell the time,

498
00:39:44,536 --> 00:39:48,237
but we aren't gonna get any place
if all you do is repeat 49 minutes!

499
00:39:48,374 --> 00:39:50,330
48 minutes.

500
00:39:50,458 --> 00:39:55,037
Yeah, all right, all right.
We'll get back to you as soon as we can.

501
00:39:57,256 --> 00:40:01,302
To hear you plead with that chickenshit
makes me ashamed to be an American!

502
00:40:01,428 --> 00:40:03,218
Go play with your trains.

503
00:40:09,059 --> 00:40:12,429
Stay tuned for an update
on the subway hijacking case.

504
00:40:14,189 --> 00:40:16,396
Get me the borough commander.

505
00:40:16,525 --> 00:40:19,099
- Turn off that goddamn music.
- Yes, sir.

506
00:40:19,236 --> 00:40:22,770
Harry? I'm headin' up to see the mayor.
What's it look like down there?

507
00:40:22,906 --> 00:40:26,440
It's murder, Phil, as usual.
They really smell blood on this one.

508
00:40:26,576 --> 00:40:30,075
- Who's your number two?
- Deputy Chief Inspector Daniels.

509
00:40:30,205 --> 00:40:33,371
He's a good man, Phil.
He handled that protest last month.

510
00:40:33,499 --> 00:40:36,833
- Get those photographers outta here!
- How are you deployed?

511
00:40:36,961 --> 00:40:39,878
50 men inside the tunnel,
north and south of the train,

512
00:40:40,005 --> 00:40:43,705
well concealed, all wearin' vests
and armed with machine guns,

513
00:40:43,842 --> 00:40:47,757
shotguns, handguns, riot guns,
and a half-dozen snipers.

514
00:40:47,888 --> 00:40:50,094
We could fight
the Third World War down there!

515
00:40:50,223 --> 00:40:54,801
Make sure they stay outta sight. If the
hijackers see 'em, we'll have a massacre.

516
00:40:54,936 --> 00:40:58,554
We have a sniper's report that
they're movin' around pretty freely.

517
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:01,441
The one in the motorman's cab
is an easy shot.

518
00:41:01,567 --> 00:41:06,562
Absolutely no! Understand? We're takin'
the threat seriously! What's upstairs?

519
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:10,612
Trucks, cars, emergency and
medical units. The works, Phil.

520
00:41:10,743 --> 00:41:13,114
Harry... tell me somethin', will ya?

521
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:18,739
They're in a tunnel, surrounded on all
sides. How do they expect to get away?

522
00:41:19,292 --> 00:41:21,783
Beats the shit out of me, Phil.

523
00:41:23,755 --> 00:41:28,216
Oh, Al, it's disgustin'.
Would you stop it with the tissue?

524
00:41:28,343 --> 00:41:32,921
Warren, tell him that other mayors have
to live in this house after we're gone.

525
00:41:33,055 --> 00:41:36,424
Go on in there, Al, and I'll send
everybody in. Just sit down.

526
00:41:36,558 --> 00:41:39,928
Thanks for comin' up
on such short notice, fellas.

527
00:41:40,062 --> 00:41:42,101
You all know Jessie, don't you?

528
00:41:43,065 --> 00:41:45,390
Good, Phil, just in time.

529
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,019
A little coffee? Some cake?

530
00:41:48,153 --> 00:41:50,726
Better skip it, Jessie. We're short on time.

531
00:41:50,864 --> 00:41:53,071
We know what's goin' on underground.

532
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,034
The issue is whether or not
we pay the ransom.

533
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,284
Phil? Whaddaya think?

534
00:41:58,413 --> 00:42:03,703
Well, we're fully mobilised. There's
enough firepower to wipe out an army.

535
00:42:03,835 --> 00:42:06,835
But... I can't guarantee
the safety of the hostages.

536
00:42:06,962 --> 00:42:10,663
In other words, you're for
payin' the ransom.

537
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,088
Well, we don't want
another Attica, do we?

538
00:42:13,218 --> 00:42:15,425
- So your vote is?
- I abstain.

539
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,718
Shit! Barney?

540
00:42:18,807 --> 00:42:22,757
The safety of the passengers is
the only concern of the Transit Authority.

541
00:42:22,895 --> 00:42:25,183
- Your vote?
- Pay the two dollars.

542
00:42:25,313 --> 00:42:28,480
If it was two dollars,
I'd pay the two dollars, Barney!

543
00:42:28,608 --> 00:42:32,440
It's a million! A one with six zeros!
Is it comin' outta your pocket?

544
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:36,437
Come on, will ya save the poor mouth
for later? How do you vote?

545
00:42:36,573 --> 00:42:40,406
- I'm not through discussin' it yet.
- Yes, you are. Now vote.

546
00:42:40,536 --> 00:42:43,157
My concern is with the taxpayers.

547
00:42:43,288 --> 00:42:46,539
I always say millions for defence
but not one cent for tribute.

548
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:50,415
- Isn't that what I always say?
- Uh-huh. So that's a "no".

549
00:42:50,545 --> 00:42:54,673
All right, Al. You've heard from
the Three Wise Men.

550
00:42:55,550 --> 00:43:00,093
- Now what do you say?
- What are they goin' to say, Warren?

551
00:43:00,513 --> 00:43:02,636
- Who?
- Everybody!

552
00:43:02,765 --> 00:43:06,597
- The press! The man on the street!
- He means the voters.

553
00:43:07,144 --> 00:43:10,726
The Times will support you,
the News will knock you.

554
00:43:10,856 --> 00:43:14,936
The Post will take both sides. The rich'll
support you. Likewise the blacks.

555
00:43:15,069 --> 00:43:18,567
The Puerto Ricans won't give a shit.
So quit stallin'.

556
00:43:18,697 --> 00:43:23,607
Stop bullyin' everybody, Warren!
This is supposed to be a democracy!

557
00:43:23,743 --> 00:43:28,321
Wise up, for Christ sake! We're tryin' to
run a city, not a goddamn democracy!

558
00:43:29,332 --> 00:43:32,001
Al, quit fartin' around! We've gotta pay!

559
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,369
Jessie?

560
00:43:34,503 --> 00:43:36,543
Jessie, what do you say?

561
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:39,413
A million dollars sounds like
a lot of money.

562
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:42,919
But just think what
you're gonna get in return.

563
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:45,924
- What?
- 18 sure votes.

564
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:50,300
All right. All right. Warren?

565
00:43:51,812 --> 00:43:54,646
- Warren, arrange for the payoff.
- Hallelujah.

566
00:43:54,773 --> 00:43:59,101
Fellas, you heard him. Phil, pass the word
to the bad guys that we're coughin' up.

567
00:43:59,235 --> 00:44:02,984
- What bank do we do business with?
- City National Trust. I'll call.

568
00:44:03,114 --> 00:44:07,740
I'll call. You'll take an hour tryin'
to knock down the interest rate.

569
00:44:09,911 --> 00:44:11,951
Jessie?

570
00:44:12,748 --> 00:44:14,788
I think I handled it all right.

571
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:18,248
A regular Fiorello La Guardia.

572
00:44:22,632 --> 00:44:26,582
- Patrolman James callin' Operations.
- This is Patrone. What's goin' on?

573
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,886
There's a lot of feet movin' around
out here in the dark.

574
00:44:30,014 --> 00:44:32,968
I figure it's a couple of dozen
sharpshooters and snipers.

575
00:44:33,101 --> 00:44:35,093
- Am I right?
- I wouldn't be surprised.

576
00:44:35,227 --> 00:44:40,814
Make sure they know I'm standin' here
between them and the hijackers.

577
00:44:40,941 --> 00:44:43,183
I'm not all that easy to see in the dark.

578
00:44:49,116 --> 00:44:51,154
Nothin' yet?

579
00:44:51,617 --> 00:44:55,236
Boy! They're sure takin'
their time, aren't they?

580
00:44:55,372 --> 00:45:00,329
- Don't worry. They're gonna have to pay.
- Suppose they don't?

581
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:03,246
Well, then a lot of people are gonna die.

582
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,920
Includin' us.

583
00:45:07,175 --> 00:45:09,926
Better than selling life insurance, isn't it?

584
00:45:10,052 --> 00:45:12,923
Life insurance? You told me
you were in the army.

585
00:45:13,055 --> 00:45:16,969
I was. That's where I developed
my expensive tastes.

586
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:20,055
British army. $ 150 a month.
You gotta be kiddin'.

587
00:45:20,187 --> 00:45:22,642
The Africans paid me 5,000.

588
00:45:23,148 --> 00:45:26,682
- A month?
- For leading a battalion.

589
00:45:26,817 --> 00:45:29,902
Jesus! What the hell'd
you get outta that for?

590
00:45:31,573 --> 00:45:33,778
Because the market dried up.

591
00:45:33,908 --> 00:45:35,947
Wow!

592
00:45:36,244 --> 00:45:38,282
5,000!

593
00:45:39,997 --> 00:45:43,081
At least you weren't fired.
But I don't give a shit.

594
00:45:43,209 --> 00:45:46,791
What guy wants to drive a subway train
for the rest of his life?

595
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,376
What did they catch you doing?

596
00:45:50,506 --> 00:45:52,546
Nothin'.

597
00:45:52,967 --> 00:45:56,134
I mean, they framed me.
They needed a fall guy.

598
00:45:56,262 --> 00:46:00,177
Transit cops. Undercover guys.
They got wind of a gang passin' dope.

599
00:46:00,308 --> 00:46:04,969
Transportin' from downtown to uptown,
and givin' it to a motorman.

600
00:46:05,354 --> 00:46:08,805
They tried to pin the evidence on me,
but they didn't find a thing.

601
00:46:08,941 --> 00:46:11,017
You were innocent?

602
00:46:11,151 --> 00:46:15,777
Of course I was innocent.
You think I'd do a thing like that?

603
00:46:19,867 --> 00:46:22,703
I'm on my way to headquarters.
We got the green light.

604
00:46:22,829 --> 00:46:25,699
That's great news.
The men are rarin' to go.

605
00:46:25,831 --> 00:46:30,328
No! We're paying 'em the ransom money.
Pass the word along to the hijackers.

606
00:46:30,462 --> 00:46:32,619
Roger.

607
00:46:32,755 --> 00:46:36,587
Borough Command to the 28th Street
platform. Come in, Daniels.

608
00:46:36,718 --> 00:46:37,748
Daniels.

609
00:46:37,884 --> 00:46:42,298
The mayor's agreed to pay.
Let the hijackers know right away.

610
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:44,470
Roger.

611
00:46:45,642 --> 00:46:48,015
Command Centre, this is 28th Street.

612
00:46:48,771 --> 00:46:51,225
Do you read me, Command Centre?

613
00:46:51,356 --> 00:46:54,808
- This is Command Centre. Who is this?
- Chief Inspector Daniels.

614
00:46:54,984 --> 00:46:58,649
The mayor's agreed to pay.
Pass it on to the hijackers right away.

615
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:00,819
Will do, sir.

616
00:47:01,574 --> 00:47:02,605
Pelham One Two Three.

617
00:47:03,033 --> 00:47:05,073
Come in, Pelham One Two Three.

618
00:47:05,661 --> 00:47:07,867
This is Pelham One Two Three.
I read you.

619
00:47:08,705 --> 00:47:12,241
We agree to pay the ransom.
Repeat, we agree to pay...

620
00:47:12,376 --> 00:47:14,783
What? They're gonna do what?

621
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,628
Do you read me, Pelham One Two Three?

622
00:47:16,755 --> 00:47:20,622
- Zach, you're outta your skull.
- I read you, Garber.

623
00:47:20,759 --> 00:47:24,376
Take down my next instructions,
to be followed to the letter.

624
00:47:25,638 --> 00:47:28,639
The money's to be paid
in the following denominations.

625
00:47:28,766 --> 00:47:30,758
500,000 dollars in fifties.

626
00:47:30,893 --> 00:47:33,515
500,000 dollars in hundreds. Right?

627
00:47:34,188 --> 00:47:37,272
500,000 in fifties. 500,000 in hundreds.

628
00:47:37,483 --> 00:47:40,056
Which will be put
in stacks of 200 bills each,

629
00:47:40,194 --> 00:47:42,269
bound with two thick elastic bands.

630
00:47:44,072 --> 00:47:46,445
Two stacks of bills, bound in what?

631
00:47:47,451 --> 00:47:50,155
Bound with thick elastic bands.

632
00:47:50,286 --> 00:47:54,449
All of the bills will be old bills,
their serial numbers to be random.

633
00:47:54,582 --> 00:47:59,956
Now that's all. When the delivery arrives
we'll contact you with further instructions.

634
00:48:00,087 --> 00:48:03,172
- About what? Your getaway?
- Signing off now.

635
00:48:03,299 --> 00:48:05,339
Son of a bitch!

636
00:48:06,301 --> 00:48:11,462
Hey, Pelham. It might interest you to
know I figured out how you're gonna do it.

637
00:48:13,975 --> 00:48:16,846
Yes, it would interest me very much.

638
00:48:16,979 --> 00:48:19,552
You're gonna make everyone
in New York City

639
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:22,477
close their eyes and count
to a hundred, right?

640
00:48:22,609 --> 00:48:26,653
It is now 2.47. That means
you have got 26 minutes...

641
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:30,859
Hey, wait a minute, pal. We agreed
to pay the money. Turn your clock off!

642
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:34,242
- 26 minutes.
- Your instructions were complicated.

643
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:37,205
The money has to be counted,
stacked, transported.

644
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,620
It just isn't physically possible.

645
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:43,074
You'd be surprised
what's physically possible.

646
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:45,251
The clock's running.

647
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:49,625
26 minutes. After that,
we scratch 'em off one per minute.

648
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:04,686
Your attention, please!

649
00:49:04,815 --> 00:49:08,398
Ladies and gentlemen,
it might interest you to know

650
00:49:08,527 --> 00:49:11,563
the city of New York has agreed
to pay for your release.

651
00:49:15,409 --> 00:49:18,658
As soon as the money gets here,
will you let us go?

652
00:49:18,787 --> 00:49:20,329
Soon after.

653
00:49:20,455 --> 00:49:25,615
Excuse me, sir. Would you mind
telling us how much you're getting?

654
00:49:25,752 --> 00:49:30,828
- Why is that of interest to you, sir?
- Well, a person likes to know his worth.

655
00:49:30,965 --> 00:49:34,665
- One million dollars.
- That's not so terrific.

656
00:49:35,886 --> 00:49:40,015
FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK
LOWER MANHATTAN

657
00:50:23,348 --> 00:50:25,590
Pull your pants up, Al.
We're goin' downtown.

658
00:50:25,725 --> 00:50:29,805
- Totally out of the question, Mr LaSalle.
- Nobody asked you.

659
00:50:29,937 --> 00:50:34,978
Warren, for Pete's sake,
I'm sick as a goat. What's the point?

660
00:50:35,109 --> 00:50:38,976
The point, for Pete's sake, is that
the mayor of the city of New York,

661
00:50:39,112 --> 00:50:41,900
trailin' by 22 points in all the polls,

662
00:50:42,032 --> 00:50:44,654
cares enough about
18 citizens in jeopardy

663
00:50:44,785 --> 00:50:47,358
to make a personal appearance
in their behalf.

664
00:50:47,495 --> 00:50:52,157
You know what'll happen?
What always happens. I'll get booed.

665
00:50:52,709 --> 00:50:55,793
- He's a very sick man.
- Will you let go of that!

666
00:50:57,963 --> 00:51:02,127
All you have to do is say a few words
to the hijackers over a bullhorn.

667
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,631
You make a dignified plea for mercy.

668
00:51:04,762 --> 00:51:08,427
Warren, suppose the hijackers
start shootin' at me?

669
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,392
Will you stop!
They have no reason to shoot at you.

670
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:14,934
Why? Do you think
they're from outta town?

671
00:51:16,231 --> 00:51:18,852
Get dressed, Al. I'll do the jokes.

672
00:51:52,682 --> 00:51:56,631
Garber. Come in, Garber.
Come in, Garber.

673
00:51:56,977 --> 00:51:59,647
- Who are we waitin' for, Z?
- Beats me.

674
00:51:59,856 --> 00:52:02,524
How long's it take to get
all that money together?

675
00:52:02,649 --> 00:52:05,401
We'll never make it.
The passengers are dead ducks.

676
00:52:05,528 --> 00:52:07,934
- I wonder what that cop's thinkin'.
- What cop?

677
00:52:08,071 --> 00:52:10,989
The one who's a hostage.
Shit, I'm glad it's not me.

678
00:52:11,116 --> 00:52:13,689
- Where's that money?
- Make yourself useful.

679
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:19,865
Get Personnel to get a list of all motormen
discharged durin' the past ten years.

680
00:52:19,999 --> 00:52:24,460
- What are you lookin' for?
- Somebody down there can drive a train.

681
00:52:24,588 --> 00:52:26,295
Tell 'em you want it today.

682
00:52:40,727 --> 00:52:43,728
Mr Grey, can I have a word
with you, please?

683
00:52:43,855 --> 00:52:46,892
Will you stop messing around
with that girl, Mr Grey?

684
00:52:47,025 --> 00:52:49,183
She's a 20-buck-a-trick hooker.

685
00:52:49,318 --> 00:52:52,320
- Who's a 20-buck-a-trick hooker?
- Leave her alone.

686
00:52:52,447 --> 00:52:54,937
Who are you to go around
callin' people "hooker"?!

687
00:52:55,074 --> 00:52:57,826
I can do this job and hump
that broad at the same time.

688
00:52:57,952 --> 00:53:02,281
Listen, you little prick! 20 bucks
wouldn't buy you a good-night kiss!

689
00:53:02,414 --> 00:53:05,285
I'm giving you an order, Mr Grey.

690
00:53:05,418 --> 00:53:07,493
Blow it outta your ass,

691
00:53:07,627 --> 00:53:09,038
Colonel.

692
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:13,876
You're talkin' to the wrong man.
I'm not your Mr B-B-B-Brown.

693
00:53:14,009 --> 00:53:17,010
I once had a man shot
for talking to me like that.

694
00:53:18,055 --> 00:53:23,641
Well, that's the difference between us.
I've always done my own killin'.

695
00:53:30,691 --> 00:53:32,482
Takin' a hell of a long time.

696
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:37,271
Think how many times you gotta wet
your thumb to count a million bucks.

697
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:54,212
Command Centre callin' 28th Street.
Come in, Inspector.

698
00:53:54,338 --> 00:53:55,536
This is Daniels.

699
00:53:55,673 --> 00:53:59,671
- Has the money left yet, Inspector?
- Not yet.

700
00:53:59,801 --> 00:54:03,087
What are they waitin' for?
Give 'em a goose, will ya?

701
00:54:03,222 --> 00:54:05,712
We're runnin' outta time!
We're runnin' outta time!

702
00:54:22,866 --> 00:54:27,326
Pelham One Two Three, this is Command
Centre. Come in, Pelham One Two Three.

703
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:31,783
- This is Pelham One Two Three.
- This is Garber.

704
00:54:31,916 --> 00:54:36,127
We're movin' a little slowly at this end,
Pelham. We need some more time.

705
00:54:36,878 --> 00:54:38,503
Sorry, no more time.

706
00:54:39,131 --> 00:54:40,791
If you can just see your way...

707
00:54:40,925 --> 00:54:45,800
- Will you hold it down, Frank?
- I want a local sent around the loop...

708
00:54:45,929 --> 00:54:49,048
I said knock it off!
I'm tryin' to buy some time here!

709
00:54:49,182 --> 00:54:51,340
And I'm tryin' to run a railroad!

710
00:54:51,476 --> 00:54:54,844
While you're playin' grab-ass
with a bunch of pirates!

711
00:54:54,979 --> 00:54:58,146
How about 15 more minutes, Pelham?
A lousy 15 minutes?

712
00:54:58,733 --> 00:54:59,763
Negative.

713
00:55:01,318 --> 00:55:05,185
Ten minutes, then. What difference
can ten minutes make to you?

714
00:55:05,322 --> 00:55:07,149
Negative.

715
00:55:11,536 --> 00:55:14,454
- Anythin' wrong?
- Wanted more time.

716
00:55:14,581 --> 00:55:18,709
- How much more?
- Just ten minutes.

717
00:55:18,835 --> 00:55:21,789
- That can't hurt anybody.
- I didn't give it to them.

718
00:55:21,922 --> 00:55:26,133
- Suppose they can't make it?
- Then we do what we said we'd do.

719
00:55:27,677 --> 00:55:31,840
- Maybe an hour isn't enough time.
- You give 'em an hour, they take an hour.

720
00:55:31,972 --> 00:55:36,764
Give 'em two hours, they take two hours.
An hour is plenty of time, Mr Green.

721
00:55:36,894 --> 00:55:39,349
Yeah, but supposin' it isn't?

722
00:55:45,152 --> 00:55:49,694
This is the borough commander.
Come in, Headquarters Charlie!

723
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:54,071
Aren't you guys movin' yet?
Do you know what the damn time is?

724
00:55:54,202 --> 00:55:56,693
We're still waitin' for the money, sir.

725
00:55:56,829 --> 00:56:00,992
If I don't see your faces before the
deadline, I don't wanna see them at all!

726
00:56:01,125 --> 00:56:03,533
- Everl
- Yes, sir.

727
00:56:03,669 --> 00:56:06,124
I told you. It's gonna be our ass.

728
00:56:11,676 --> 00:56:15,342
- This is a million dollars?
- It's what it buys. Not what it weighs.

729
00:57:01,974 --> 00:57:04,643
Eight minutes. We're not gonna make it.

730
00:57:11,358 --> 00:57:16,482
- Inspector, where are they now, please?
- Centre Street, just north of Chambers.

731
00:57:16,613 --> 00:57:19,614
That gives us seven minutes.
Not enough time, sir.

732
00:57:19,741 --> 00:57:24,153
Even if they get to 28th Street on time,
we still gotta carry it down track on foot.

733
00:57:24,287 --> 00:57:26,327
No way, sir.

734
00:57:31,085 --> 00:57:34,204
Look, we're scarin' the shit
outta everybody.

735
00:57:34,338 --> 00:57:36,377
Yeah, includin' me.

736
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:46,630
Pelham One Two Three, this is Garber.
Come in, Pelham One Two Three.

737
00:57:46,766 --> 00:57:49,222
Garber, this is Pelham One Two Three.

738
00:57:49,352 --> 00:57:54,559
The money's en route, makin' pretty good
time too, but it won't get to you by 3.13.

739
00:57:54,691 --> 00:57:56,813
I'm very sorry to hear that.

740
00:57:56,942 --> 00:57:59,149
Suppose we get it to the entrance by then.

741
00:57:59,278 --> 00:58:03,322
Will you change your deadline from
delivery to you to arrival at 28th Street?

742
00:58:03,448 --> 00:58:09,202
Would you do that at least? Do you
read me, Pelham, for cryin' out loud?

743
00:58:12,457 --> 00:58:15,826
All right, Garber.
But no more concessions.

744
00:58:16,002 --> 00:58:19,786
- Is that quite clear?
- Quite clear. Quite clear.

745
00:58:20,715 --> 00:58:25,045
They bought it. If we get the money
to the station by 3.13 we'll be OK.

746
00:58:25,178 --> 00:58:26,340
Good work, Garber.

747
00:58:26,637 --> 00:58:30,469
Headquarters Charlie,
headin' north on Centre Street...

748
00:58:30,683 --> 00:58:32,556
You've got four minutes!

749
00:58:32,684 --> 00:58:35,354
Yes, sir, we'll make it...
We'll never make it.

750
00:58:35,479 --> 00:58:37,518
Sir, the mayor is on his way down.

751
00:58:37,647 --> 00:58:39,770
We'll hold the crowd till he gets here.

752
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:10,967
Mr Green.

753
00:59:11,346 --> 00:59:12,342
Yes.

754
00:59:13,348 --> 00:59:15,803
Coming up in one minute.

755
00:59:24,317 --> 00:59:26,938
Have you decided which one
it's gonna be?

756
00:59:27,069 --> 00:59:29,311
Does that make any difference?

757
00:59:31,573 --> 00:59:33,613
I guess not.

758
00:59:40,749 --> 00:59:45,292
OK. 50 seconds and then
I'm gonna eliminate one.

759
00:59:48,673 --> 00:59:52,967
Headquarters Charlie,
approachin' Astor Place.

760
00:59:53,094 --> 00:59:57,138
You've still got 28 blocks!
Floor the son of a bitch!

761
01:00:08,692 --> 01:00:11,728
Whaddaya mean, it's been wrecked?
We're outta time!

762
01:00:11,861 --> 01:00:15,562
I know we're outta time.
Couldn't make it, that's all.

763
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:18,901
That's all? They're about
to shoot an innocent person!

764
01:00:19,035 --> 01:00:22,950
If they know the truck is wrecked,
how can they expect us to be on time?

765
01:00:23,081 --> 01:00:26,745
They don't know anythin' down there.
How can they know anythin'...

766
01:00:26,876 --> 01:00:28,916
Holy mackerel, that's it.

767
01:00:29,295 --> 01:00:33,957
Pelham One Two Three, the money has
arrived. Repeat, the money has arrived.

768
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:38,678
Do you read me, Pelham One Two Three?
The money has arrived.

769
01:00:39,888 --> 01:00:44,384
This is Pelham One Two Three.
You made it just in time, didn't you?

770
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:58,526
Get it up there! Move!

771
01:01:03,035 --> 01:01:04,908
I hope it works.

772
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:13,666
Are you still there, Garber?

773
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:18,332
Still here. Tell me somethin', Pelham.

774
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:22,049
If we were a second late, you would've
knocked off an innocent party?

775
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:26,045
Affirmative. Now the instructions
for the delivery of the money.

776
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:29,218
As usual, you'll follow them
to the letter, OK?

777
01:01:29,351 --> 01:01:31,391
I got it. Go ahead.

778
01:01:32,104 --> 01:01:33,848
Two unarmed policemen...

779
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:34,929
Atchoo!

780
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,516
Gesundheit.

781
01:01:37,651 --> 01:01:40,604
Two unarmed policemen
will walk down the track.

782
01:01:40,737 --> 01:01:42,943
One with the money,
the other with a torch,

783
01:01:43,073 --> 01:01:46,108
which he will flash continuously
from side to side.

784
01:01:46,701 --> 01:01:49,737
When they reach the car,
the rear door will be opened

785
01:01:49,871 --> 01:01:52,824
and the one with the money
will throw it onto the train.

786
01:01:52,957 --> 01:01:57,703
Then they will both turn and walk back
to 28th Street station. Acknowledge.

787
01:01:57,836 --> 01:02:00,244
- I got it. Is that all?
- That's all for now.

788
01:02:00,381 --> 01:02:03,831
But keep in mind, won't you,
that the same ground rules apply.

789
01:02:03,967 --> 01:02:07,751
Any wrong move by anyone
and I kill a hostage.

790
01:02:07,888 --> 01:02:09,632
Coulda guessed that part.

791
01:02:09,764 --> 01:02:12,718
You have got five minutes
to deliver this money.

792
01:02:13,101 --> 01:02:15,474
You don't think
you're gonna get out, do ya?

793
01:02:15,645 --> 01:02:17,768
It's now 3.14.

794
01:02:18,273 --> 01:02:19,981
You've got till 3.19.

795
01:02:20,108 --> 01:02:21,518
Over.

796
01:02:22,443 --> 01:02:24,352
Over. Bastard.

797
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:34,743
About fuckin' time!

798
01:02:34,871 --> 01:02:37,327
You two! Get the money outta there!

799
01:02:37,458 --> 01:02:40,742
Which one has the flashlight?
Then you carry the money.

800
01:02:40,877 --> 01:02:43,249
Gimme that paper.
You've got four minutes!

801
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:46,415
Never mind the goddamn salutes!
Just get goin'!

802
01:02:55,641 --> 01:02:58,013
Jesus, it's the goddamn mayor.

803
01:03:01,313 --> 01:03:04,682
- You get the feelin' we ain't alone?
- Whaddaya mean?

804
01:03:08,945 --> 01:03:13,940
We got four sub-machine-guns in front
of us, and all these jokers behind us.

805
01:03:14,076 --> 01:03:17,444
I feel like I'm walkin' into
the fuckin' OK Corral.

806
01:03:22,208 --> 01:03:24,247
Pow!

807
01:03:24,544 --> 01:03:26,582
Shit!

808
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:10,916
Hold your fire, goddamnit!

809
01:04:11,046 --> 01:04:13,003
Quiet!

810
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:25,048
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. It's not too b-b-bad.

811
01:04:25,184 --> 01:04:28,635
- I think it went right through.
- Move back, come on. Move back.

812
01:04:28,771 --> 01:04:31,724
Give me that scarf. Give me that scarf!

813
01:04:31,857 --> 01:04:33,684
Keep quiet!

814
01:04:33,817 --> 01:04:37,648
- OK?
- Yeah. I don't feel p-pain too much.

815
01:04:38,363 --> 01:04:40,652
- How many shots?
- Just one.

816
01:04:40,782 --> 01:04:45,111
The rest was me and then they answered.
I didn't see anybody, I just got mad.

817
01:04:45,244 --> 01:04:46,620
Goddamnit!

818
01:04:46,746 --> 01:04:48,205
Mr Grey?

819
01:04:51,834 --> 01:04:55,037
You don't think they're finished
out there, do ya?

820
01:04:55,170 --> 01:04:58,871
Go back there and help Mr Green,
will you, please?

821
01:05:00,468 --> 01:05:03,551
Some girl-scout
chickenshit outfit I'm in here.

822
01:05:06,723 --> 01:05:10,472
I suppose somebody out there
got nervous or bored.

823
01:05:10,602 --> 01:05:12,641
Been there a long time.

824
01:05:13,646 --> 01:05:15,520
Can't afford to let it pass.

825
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:22,147
Who started it?
Who fired first? Them or us?

826
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:26,656
I don't know, Lieutenant. It came from
somewhere behind me in the dark.

827
01:05:26,784 --> 01:05:28,990
It had to be one of the snipers.

828
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:33,117
Somebody just took it in his head
to fire on his own? How could he?

829
01:05:33,248 --> 01:05:35,490
Easy, Lieutenant.

830
01:05:35,626 --> 01:05:37,333
Real easy.

831
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:40,664
Can you see what's goin' on
inside the train?

832
01:05:41,256 --> 01:05:44,422
No, not too good.
I'd sure hate to be in there findin' out.

833
01:05:56,228 --> 01:05:58,268
Conductor.

834
01:06:02,234 --> 01:06:05,733
- You mean me?
- Yes. Stand up and come down here.

835
01:06:06,196 --> 01:06:08,983
- Why, what are you gonna do?
- You can help me.

836
01:06:09,116 --> 01:06:13,742
- Come on. Come down here.
- Look, if he doesn't wanna go...

837
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:18,412
All right, everybody. Just get back
on your seats. Very quietly.

838
01:06:19,333 --> 01:06:21,540
Come on. Back on your seats.

839
01:06:21,669 --> 01:06:25,583
All right, conductor. I want you to
walk up track about a hundred feet.

840
01:06:25,714 --> 01:06:29,414
Just wait for the men delivering
the money, all right?

841
01:06:29,551 --> 01:06:31,591
I'll open the door for you.

842
01:06:33,597 --> 01:06:35,969
Why do I have to go?

843
01:06:40,354 --> 01:06:43,473
Come on. Please go.
There's nothing to worry about.

844
01:06:46,610 --> 01:06:49,147
Look! Somebody's climbin' down!

845
01:06:55,826 --> 01:06:58,068
Christ, he's comin' this way!

846
01:07:02,666 --> 01:07:04,209
Oh, no!

847
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:15,125
What?

848
01:07:15,262 --> 01:07:19,175
Why would they shoot a hostage?
We're still under the deadline.

849
01:07:19,307 --> 01:07:22,308
- Somebody threw a shot at them.
- Who the hell was it?

850
01:07:22,435 --> 01:07:24,842
Nobody knows. My bet is we never will.

851
01:07:24,979 --> 01:07:28,015
Z, when are we gonna hear
from that cop who's on board?

852
01:07:28,149 --> 01:07:32,098
What do you want, Rico? A suicide?
There's heavily armed men down there.

853
01:07:32,236 --> 01:07:36,399
What chance has one lousy cop got,
especially if it's a dame?

854
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:39,238
Boy, what a mess!

855
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:45,787
Pelham One Two Three, come in.
This is Garber.

856
01:07:45,916 --> 01:07:48,370
Here is Pelham One Two Three.
Come in, Garber.

857
01:07:48,501 --> 01:07:51,372
For Christ's sake, fella,
did ya have to do it?

858
01:07:51,504 --> 01:07:54,754
One of my men was fired at.
I warned you what the penalty would be.

859
01:07:54,882 --> 01:07:57,717
- Yeah, you warned me.
- Where's the money?

860
01:07:59,219 --> 01:08:02,007
I'm going to give you 30 seconds more.

861
01:08:11,439 --> 01:08:12,981
Hey, you guys!

862
01:08:13,108 --> 01:08:17,568
- Christ, who's that?
- Transit cop. I got orders for you.

863
01:08:17,695 --> 01:08:20,317
Resume delivery on the double.

864
01:08:20,448 --> 01:08:23,698
I don't suppose we could
have that in writin'?

865
01:08:31,792 --> 01:08:34,247
Mr Blue, we got a light!

866
01:08:49,475 --> 01:08:52,559
All right. Open the door,
would you, Mr Brown?

867
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:56,970
All right, gentlemen.
Hands in evidence, please.

868
01:08:57,190 --> 01:08:59,230
Put up your hands!

869
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:05,566
All right. Throw the money up here.

870
01:09:06,575 --> 01:09:08,615
Into the cab.

871
01:09:08,743 --> 01:09:10,783
Push it up.

872
01:09:11,454 --> 01:09:14,455
Thank you. Now turn around.

873
01:09:16,334 --> 01:09:20,710
Go home to your wives and children.
Keep the hands up. Take it very easily.

874
01:09:21,171 --> 01:09:23,710
Shut the door, Mr Brown, will you?

875
01:09:41,316 --> 01:09:43,356
Mr Grey.

876
01:09:44,235 --> 01:09:46,274
Jesus H Christ!

877
01:09:49,699 --> 01:09:52,071
I've never seen a million dollars before.

878
01:09:52,201 --> 01:09:54,871
You can load up first, Mr Grey.

879
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:00,116
I'll talk to Garber.

880
01:10:00,251 --> 01:10:02,788
All that money! I can't believe it!

881
01:10:03,336 --> 01:10:05,413
I'm gonna die today.

882
01:10:05,547 --> 01:10:08,417
Well... either you live or you die.

883
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:13,261
- That's 18 packs each, right?
- Right.

884
01:10:28,068 --> 01:10:31,188
This is Pelham One Two Three.
Do you read me, Garber?

885
01:10:31,321 --> 01:10:35,366
- This is Garber. Go ahead.
- I'm gonna give you three instructions.

886
01:10:35,492 --> 01:10:38,243
Each one is to be followed precisely.
Is that clear?

887
01:10:38,369 --> 01:10:39,828
So far.

888
01:10:40,163 --> 01:10:45,916
1) At the end of this conversation, you
will restore power to the entire sector.

889
01:10:46,878 --> 01:10:48,456
Right. Restore power.

890
01:10:49,463 --> 01:10:53,710
2) You will clear the local track all the
way from 28th Street to South Ferry.

891
01:10:53,843 --> 01:10:57,507
By clear I mean switches properly set,
all signals green.

892
01:10:57,638 --> 01:10:59,429
I emphasise green, Garber.

893
01:10:59,557 --> 01:11:02,889
If I so much as see a red light,
let alone get tripped by one,

894
01:11:03,018 --> 01:11:05,094
I'll shoot another hostage.

895
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:17,192
You will also remove all police
from the tunnel.

896
01:11:17,323 --> 01:11:19,992
If I see a policeman
between here and South Ferry,

897
01:11:20,409 --> 01:11:24,572
I'll shoot another hostage.
Any deviation, I'll shoot another hostage.

898
01:11:24,705 --> 01:11:29,700
Listen, fella, after this is over
you should seek out psychiatric help.

899
01:11:30,294 --> 01:11:35,039
Let me know when all my points have
been complied with. Over and out.

900
01:11:37,008 --> 01:11:39,879
- Rico, are you there?
- I'm here, Z. What's up?

901
01:11:40,011 --> 01:11:42,466
Hold on while I cut in the City cops.

902
01:11:43,222 --> 01:11:45,760
Frank, hook me up and get outta there.

903
01:11:47,185 --> 01:11:49,224
What a way to run a railroad!

904
01:11:51,230 --> 01:11:53,935
- Inspector Daniels. This is Garber.
- This is Daniels.

905
01:11:54,274 --> 01:11:58,224
Inspector, I have Lieutenant Patrone
of the Transit Police on the line.

906
01:11:58,362 --> 01:12:03,024
The hijackers want power restored,
all tracks cleared,

907
01:12:03,367 --> 01:12:07,067
signals green to South Ferry,
and no cops anywhere in sight.

908
01:12:07,203 --> 01:12:11,201
OK, sir, so we go along with that.
We have to. But then what?

909
01:12:11,333 --> 01:12:13,823
- What do you think they got in mind?
- Beats me, Z.

910
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:16,451
I wouldn't have picked a tunnel
for a getaway.

911
01:12:16,671 --> 01:12:18,295
But they did pick it.

912
01:12:18,422 --> 01:12:23,001
And since everythin' they've done has
been worked out to the smallest detail,

913
01:12:23,136 --> 01:12:25,756
it stands to reason
they got the rest worked out.

914
01:12:25,888 --> 01:12:29,055
Power restored and track cleared.
But why South Ferry?

915
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:34,521
Well, do you think it's the water, Rico?
Maybe they got a boat in the harbour.

916
01:12:34,772 --> 01:12:39,647
We'd better play it one step at a time.
Garber, you see about restorin' the power.

917
01:12:39,776 --> 01:12:42,729
I'll start pullin' our units out of the tunnel.

918
01:12:42,862 --> 01:12:47,239
We can follow them on the street.
Except how do we know where they'll be?

919
01:12:47,366 --> 01:12:50,118
Grand Central Tower
has 'em on their board.

920
01:12:50,244 --> 01:12:54,028
They stop any place before South Ferry,
we know about it.

921
01:12:54,289 --> 01:12:55,997
I'll check in when I get to my car.

922
01:12:56,625 --> 01:12:59,460
I just figured out how
they're gonna get away.

923
01:12:59,586 --> 01:13:02,872
- I'm listenin'.
- They're gonna fly the train to Cuba.

924
01:13:05,216 --> 01:13:06,924
You're a sick man, Rico.

925
01:13:07,052 --> 01:13:11,262
Whaddaya want me to do?
The power's still off! Move 'em by bus!

926
01:13:11,389 --> 01:13:14,343
You haven't got any buses?
Go out and hijack some!

927
01:13:14,475 --> 01:13:18,722
Hey, Garber, what's goin' on?
Do I get my trains back now or don't I?

928
01:13:18,854 --> 01:13:20,562
You don't. Not yet.

929
01:13:20,690 --> 01:13:23,643
Do you realise the goddamn
rush hour starts in an hour?

930
01:13:23,775 --> 01:13:27,192
Will you shut up and listen?
I got a new set of instructions.

931
01:13:27,321 --> 01:13:33,441
Your fuckin' instructions! I'm not liftin' a
finger to help the killers of Caz Dolowicz.

932
01:13:37,706 --> 01:13:38,951
Hey!

933
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:42,082
Now you listen to me,
you dumb son of a bitch.

934
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:46,503
If you don't do what I say, you'll be havin'
dinner tonight with Caz Dolowicz!

935
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:48,670
Jesus Christ, what are you...!

936
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:57,593
OK.

937
01:13:58,391 --> 01:14:00,431
Better take the case out.

938
01:14:07,067 --> 01:14:10,482
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
Pay attention, please.

939
01:14:10,611 --> 01:14:12,688
In a while we hope to be moving again.

940
01:14:12,822 --> 01:14:15,988
Then, with a bit of luck,
you'll be released unharmed.

941
01:14:16,116 --> 01:14:20,067
Until then, of course,
you'll continue to obey my orders.

942
01:14:20,204 --> 01:14:22,243
Thank you for your cooperation.

943
01:14:22,372 --> 01:14:24,412
Hey, dude.

944
01:14:25,501 --> 01:14:29,747
As you're goin' downtown anyway, you
mind droppin' me off at Fulton Street?

945
01:14:30,172 --> 01:14:33,173
You're a wise mother, you know that?
Like some more?

946
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:38,469
This'll give 'em a jolt,
even before they expected it.

947
01:14:38,805 --> 01:14:41,343
- Look at this.
- Holy Christ, she's movin'.

948
01:14:41,474 --> 01:14:44,926
They promised to wait until
we cleared track all the way down.

949
01:14:45,061 --> 01:14:47,100
Jenkins, get Command Centre.

950
01:14:47,688 --> 01:14:49,977
Grand Central Tower,
callin' Command Centre.

951
01:14:50,108 --> 01:14:52,859
- Command Centre.
- She's movin'.

952
01:14:52,985 --> 01:14:55,357
- Who's movin'?
- Pelham One Two Three.

953
01:14:55,488 --> 01:14:57,526
What? Since when?

954
01:14:57,656 --> 01:14:59,031
Just started.

955
01:14:59,157 --> 01:15:01,530
Hold on. I'll put ya on a tie-in.

956
01:15:02,578 --> 01:15:04,617
Rico, she's movin'.

957
01:15:06,122 --> 01:15:08,696
- Who's movin'?
- Who do ya think? Pelham.

958
01:15:09,083 --> 01:15:12,998
- It's too soon. We're not set up yet.
- You heard from Daniels yet?

959
01:15:13,129 --> 01:15:15,370
He's in a squad car
on Park Avenue South.

960
01:15:16,632 --> 01:15:19,717
- Inspector? She's movin', sir.
- Who's movin'?

961
01:15:21,053 --> 01:15:24,387
What's the matter with everybody?
How many hijacked trains we got?

962
01:15:24,807 --> 01:15:28,555
They're not supposed to do that yet.
How far have they gone?

963
01:15:28,685 --> 01:15:33,062
- Grand Central? How far have they gone?
- Comin' up on 23rd Street.

964
01:15:33,398 --> 01:15:38,025
- Better move those cops off the platform.
- Better follow along down Park Avenue.

965
01:15:38,153 --> 01:15:39,481
Get me 23rd Street.

966
01:15:39,612 --> 01:15:41,521
Comin' in to 23rd Street.

967
01:15:41,656 --> 01:15:44,442
All right. Steady as she goes now.

968
01:16:04,219 --> 01:16:10,387
Garber? Just had a terrible thought. What
if they set the throttle and jumped off?

969
01:16:10,516 --> 01:16:14,430
While we're chasin' the train, they're
sneakin' out somewhere behind us.

970
01:16:14,562 --> 01:16:17,267
Ingenious, sir, except it's impossible.

971
01:16:17,398 --> 01:16:21,561
- Why?
- A gizmo known as a deadman's feature.

972
01:16:21,694 --> 01:16:25,560
It's built into the control handle
in case the motorman drops dead.

973
01:16:25,697 --> 01:16:30,276
The handle has to have a man's hand
pressin' down on it, hard, at all times.

974
01:16:30,411 --> 01:16:33,115
Otherwise it don't work.
The train stops cold.

975
01:16:33,246 --> 01:16:34,622
I see.

976
01:16:34,748 --> 01:16:39,575
Nice try, though. I'll give 'em a call
in case you're still worried about it.

977
01:16:40,044 --> 01:16:43,626
Pelham One Two Three,
what's goin' on down there?

978
01:16:43,756 --> 01:16:46,627
The tracks aren't cleared yet.
How come you're movin'?

979
01:16:46,759 --> 01:16:49,214
We're trying to put some
distance between us

980
01:16:49,344 --> 01:16:52,880
and all those policemen
you've got hidden back there.

981
01:16:53,015 --> 01:16:55,422
You're gonna run into a lot of red signals.

982
01:16:55,559 --> 01:16:59,094
- I don't want you to blame us for it.
- I won't blame you for anything.

983
01:16:59,229 --> 01:17:03,061
Just let us know when you've
cleared the track. OK, signing off.

984
01:17:03,233 --> 01:17:08,856
Do you think he's able to figure anythin'
out? I mean, all those questions.

985
01:17:08,988 --> 01:17:12,073
Not surprising under
the circumstances, is it?

986
01:17:12,908 --> 01:17:15,364
They're thinking what
we want them to think.

987
01:17:15,494 --> 01:17:17,701
Ah, there it is.

988
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:21,281
OK. Stop a few yards past it, will you?

989
01:17:21,417 --> 01:17:23,457
All right.

990
01:17:27,256 --> 01:17:28,880
Thank you, Mr Green.

991
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:34,930
He shut down again. Pass it along.

992
01:17:35,055 --> 01:17:39,763
Grand Central Tower callin' Command
Centre. Come in, Command Centre.

993
01:17:39,893 --> 01:17:40,924
Command Centre.

994
01:17:41,061 --> 01:17:44,559
She stopped again, Lieutenant.
Below 18th Street station.

995
01:17:44,689 --> 01:17:46,728
Got ya. Thanks.

996
01:17:47,358 --> 01:17:49,813
Inspector, they stopped again.
Where are you?

997
01:17:49,943 --> 01:17:53,313
- Approachin' 17th Street.
- Pull over. You're right above them.

998
01:17:53,447 --> 01:17:55,273
And then what?

999
01:17:55,407 --> 01:17:57,981
It's up to them. I'll get back to you, sir.

1000
01:18:08,545 --> 01:18:12,921
Pelham One Two Three. Callin' Pelham
One Two Three. Come in, please.

1001
01:18:14,759 --> 01:18:19,467
Pelham One Two Three, Pelham One Two
Three, this is Command Centre. Come in.

1002
01:18:19,596 --> 01:18:21,636
Quick as you can.

1003
01:18:22,308 --> 01:18:25,557
Pelham One Two Three.
This is Garber. Come in, please.

1004
01:18:25,686 --> 01:18:27,725
Come in, please.

1005
01:18:29,689 --> 01:18:32,311
What the hell's goin' on out there?

1006
01:18:32,442 --> 01:18:34,234
Who s-s-said you could talk?

1007
01:18:37,196 --> 01:18:42,356
Pelham One Two Three, come in. Pelham
One Two Three, why don't you answer?

1008
01:18:43,828 --> 01:18:46,319
Frank, how long before
the track's cleared?

1009
01:18:46,456 --> 01:18:50,323
You mean before this railroad is so fucked
it'll take a computer to put it back?

1010
01:18:50,459 --> 01:18:53,246
Yes, Frank, that's what I meant.

1011
01:18:53,378 --> 01:18:57,079
About five or six minutes.
I got a snag at Brooklyn Bridge.

1012
01:18:58,133 --> 01:19:01,881
- There's somethin' goin' on down there.
- Whaddaya think?

1013
01:19:02,012 --> 01:19:04,254
I don't have the slightest idea.

1014
01:19:05,097 --> 01:19:08,763
Rico, I don't care what those clowns said,
I want men on every...

1015
01:19:08,893 --> 01:19:11,099
Wait a minute. Hold on a second.

1016
01:19:11,228 --> 01:19:12,260
Inspector Daniels?

1017
01:19:12,396 --> 01:19:16,525
I think we need officers on every platform
from 14th Street to South Ferry.

1018
01:19:16,650 --> 01:19:18,690
Good idea, Lieutenant. Will do.

1019
01:19:18,819 --> 01:19:21,489
I'll come up to 17th Street and join ya.

1020
01:19:22,906 --> 01:19:25,397
Rico, how about that list of motormen?

1021
01:19:25,534 --> 01:19:28,072
They're workin' on it. I told 'em to rush it.

1022
01:19:28,204 --> 01:19:32,580
Come up here and take over the radio for
me. But don't tell 'em the track's clear.

1023
01:19:32,708 --> 01:19:35,412
I don't want them startin' again
until I get there.

1024
01:19:35,543 --> 01:19:36,919
Will do, Z.

1025
01:20:26,675 --> 01:20:29,878
- Inspector Daniels?
- Daniels.

1026
01:20:30,011 --> 01:20:33,711
Oh, l, uh... I thought you were a, uh...
like a shorter guy.

1027
01:20:33,848 --> 01:20:36,137
I don't know what I thought.

1028
01:20:36,810 --> 01:20:39,596
- Anythin' happenin'?
- They're still down there.

1029
01:20:39,729 --> 01:20:42,683
If this street collapsed,
we'd land right on top of 'em.

1030
01:20:42,815 --> 01:20:45,306
Command Centre to DCl, Manhattan.

1031
01:20:46,568 --> 01:20:48,360
Yeah, Rico, this is Garber.

1032
01:20:48,487 --> 01:20:52,105
Track's been cleared for two minutes.
Should I call the hijackers?

1033
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:56,784
Yeah, let 'em know. And let us know
when they start movin', will ya?

1034
01:20:56,912 --> 01:21:01,159
What do we do? If they pick up speed
on us we'll have trouble keepin' up.

1035
01:21:01,291 --> 01:21:04,457
I think we oughta take off.
Get a jump on them for a change.

1036
01:21:04,586 --> 01:21:09,496
Move it. Tell the sergeant to hold
the men here until further word.

1037
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:11,672
Yes, sir.

1038
01:21:15,763 --> 01:21:17,008
Fits like a glove.

1039
01:21:17,139 --> 01:21:20,923
- Is it gonna come away clean?
- It's gonna work all right.

1040
01:21:21,059 --> 01:21:23,551
Command Centre to
Pelham One Two Three.

1041
01:21:23,687 --> 01:21:26,357
- Who's that?
- Give me the mike.

1042
01:21:29,401 --> 01:21:32,520
- Here.
- This is Pelham.

1043
01:21:32,653 --> 01:21:36,189
- What happened to Garber?
- Even great men have to pee.

1044
01:21:36,783 --> 01:21:39,700
The track's cleared
all the way to South Ferry.

1045
01:21:39,827 --> 01:21:42,663
Thank you.
Give the lieutenant my regards.

1046
01:21:43,122 --> 01:21:46,407
- Do it yourself, at the arraignment.
- Over and out.

1047
01:21:46,542 --> 01:21:48,250
Best get going.

1048
01:21:48,377 --> 01:21:50,416
All right, Mr Brown.

1049
01:21:59,262 --> 01:22:03,425
You will all remain seated.
That means nobody is to get up.

1050
01:22:05,894 --> 01:22:07,353
OK.

1051
01:22:14,318 --> 01:22:17,070
- Now what?
- Me you're askin'?

1052
01:22:39,926 --> 01:22:41,965
OK. Come on.

1053
01:22:45,973 --> 01:22:48,180
Hey, where are you goin'?!

1054
01:22:48,309 --> 01:22:50,597
I'm a police officer!

1055
01:22:54,565 --> 01:22:57,518
- Mr Blue?
- Yeah, what do you want?

1056
01:22:57,651 --> 01:23:01,600
- I thought I saw somethin' f-f-fall off.
- What do you mean, something?

1057
01:23:01,738 --> 01:23:06,400
- Might've been a person. I ain't sure.
- All right, let's make sure.

1058
01:23:07,243 --> 01:23:10,363
We haven't got time.
Get back up here. Come on.

1059
01:23:18,879 --> 01:23:22,497
Command Centre,
Pelham One Two Three's in motion!

1060
01:23:39,607 --> 01:23:41,980
Where do you think
they're takin' us now?!

1061
01:23:42,110 --> 01:23:46,107
- Don't worry, they're gonna let us all go!
- How do you know that?!

1062
01:23:46,239 --> 01:23:48,729
They got the money!
They got what they want!

1063
01:23:53,078 --> 01:23:56,494
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Can't anybody count?

1064
01:23:57,165 --> 01:23:59,704
They all four got off!

1065
01:24:00,251 --> 01:24:04,119
There's nobody drivin' the fuckin' train!

1066
01:24:10,804 --> 01:24:13,258
Anybody in there?!

1067
01:24:22,106 --> 01:24:23,896
All right, all clear.

1068
01:24:24,024 --> 01:24:26,978
All right, then. You know the drill.

1069
01:24:27,110 --> 01:24:30,313
We do it by the numbers. Hats.

1070
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:36,107
- Glasses.
- Drills and numbers...

1071
01:24:36,244 --> 01:24:39,198
This is all chickenshit.
Why don't we just do it?

1072
01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:41,369
Moustaches.

1073
01:24:54,094 --> 01:24:56,763
All right, reverse coats.

1074
01:25:07,774 --> 01:25:12,400
Pelham One Two Three's between Astor
Place and Bleecker. Speed's increasin'.

1075
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:16,604
Pelham One Two Three now between
Astor Place and Bleecker.

1076
01:25:17,032 --> 01:25:22,371
Doesn't make any sense. They know
we're monitorin' their position.

1077
01:25:22,496 --> 01:25:24,156
- So?
- So it's dumb.

1078
01:25:24,289 --> 01:25:25,997
Who said crooks were smart?

1079
01:25:26,124 --> 01:25:30,453
But these have been smart.
We're overlookin' somethin', Inspector.

1080
01:25:31,004 --> 01:25:33,044
OK. New hats.

1081
01:25:43,099 --> 01:25:45,804
OK. Magazines in pockets.

1082
01:25:50,356 --> 01:25:54,223
- I never knew these things went so fast!
- We're gonna be killed!

1083
01:25:54,526 --> 01:25:59,234
- Stop it! Nobody's gonna get killed!
- A hell of a lot you know, old man!

1084
01:25:59,364 --> 01:26:03,528
But I do know! I've been ridin' the
subways since before you were born!

1085
01:26:03,660 --> 01:26:09,081
I'm an expert. You see, they have
something called stoppers,

1086
01:26:09,207 --> 01:26:11,532
or stickers, or something like that.

1087
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:16,375
And whenever a train goes by a red light,
these things stop them.

1088
01:26:16,672 --> 01:26:19,424
- There's just one thing, baby!
- What's that?

1089
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:22,005
They're all green!

1090
01:26:29,642 --> 01:26:34,434
Inspector, that short move they made
between 28th Street and 17th Street.

1091
01:26:34,564 --> 01:26:37,731
- Why'd they do that?
- I don't know.

1092
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:40,100
Suppose they wanted to do somethin'

1093
01:26:40,236 --> 01:26:42,941
they didn't want anybody else
to know about?

1094
01:26:43,072 --> 01:26:46,571
- Like what?
- Like jumpin' off the train.

1095
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:49,156
Turn around.
We're goin' back to 17th Street.

1096
01:26:49,286 --> 01:26:52,370
- Like hell we are!
- They are not on the train. I'm sure of it.

1097
01:26:52,497 --> 01:26:55,582
I suggested that in the first place.
You shot me down.

1098
01:26:55,709 --> 01:26:59,243
- A deadman's feature?
- They figured out how to beat that!

1099
01:26:59,379 --> 01:27:02,913
That's their plan!
That's what they started with!

1100
01:27:03,591 --> 01:27:06,213
Turn this thing around and burn rubber.

1101
01:27:11,724 --> 01:27:13,764
Guns to Mr Brown.

1102
01:27:20,149 --> 01:27:24,561
Mr Grey, would you be good enough
to give that gun to Mr Brown, please?

1103
01:27:24,695 --> 01:27:29,190
No. This ain't gonna go nowhere.
This is gonna stay with me.

1104
01:27:31,451 --> 01:27:34,024
Mr Grey, bring that gun back here, please.

1105
01:27:34,162 --> 01:27:39,286
What if they're waitin' for us up there?
I want some heavy artillery with me.

1106
01:27:39,416 --> 01:27:44,044
- Mr Grey, I won't ask you again.
- Blow it outta your ass, Mr Blue.

1107
01:27:52,846 --> 01:27:54,590
Oh, my God.

1108
01:27:57,392 --> 01:27:59,432
Let's get his money!

1109
01:28:01,355 --> 01:28:03,393
Mr Green, come on!

1110
01:28:57,324 --> 01:28:58,901
Mr Blue!

1111
01:28:59,576 --> 01:29:01,615
Did you get him?

1112
01:29:02,453 --> 01:29:07,162
You go on ahead. We'll meet
where we planned. Right?

1113
01:29:17,218 --> 01:29:22,175
- You better be right about this, Garber.
- Even if I am, it's probably too late.

1114
01:29:48,122 --> 01:29:51,122
Where are those goddamn red lights?!

1115
01:30:00,842 --> 01:30:02,336
We're not stopping!

1116
01:30:02,468 --> 01:30:05,220
There is going to be a red light!
There has to be!

1117
01:30:05,347 --> 01:30:08,964
- What if there isn't?!
- There has to be!

1118
01:30:32,497 --> 01:30:34,122
Check the emergency exits!

1119
01:30:34,249 --> 01:30:38,116
Inspector, you take 15th Street.
Officer, you take 17th Street.

1120
01:30:38,252 --> 01:30:39,663
Right, sir.

1121
01:31:05,903 --> 01:31:07,695
Are you a policeman?

1122
01:31:09,824 --> 01:31:13,904
Well done. The mayor
will go to your funeral.

1123
01:31:14,995 --> 01:31:18,364
Excuse me, fella,
would you mind droppin' that gun?

1124
01:31:19,208 --> 01:31:20,453
Drop it!

1125
01:31:35,055 --> 01:31:41,390
Officer, I suppose you couldn't use
a quarter of a million dollars, could you?

1126
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,928
Quarter of a million? No, thanks.

1127
01:31:44,065 --> 01:31:48,856
My accountant says I've accepted
enough for this fiscal quarter.

1128
01:31:50,946 --> 01:31:53,353
You're the English guy on the radio.

1129
01:31:53,490 --> 01:31:55,114
Yes.

1130
01:31:56,076 --> 01:31:59,527
- Lieutenant Garber?
- Right. Do you wanna move along?

1131
01:32:00,580 --> 01:32:05,325
Excuse me... Do you people
still execute in this state?

1132
01:32:06,127 --> 01:32:09,662
What? Oh, execute.
No. Not at the moment.

1133
01:32:10,088 --> 01:32:11,713
Pity.

1134
01:32:39,117 --> 01:32:40,444
Christ!

1135
01:32:56,508 --> 01:33:01,335
We'll have an ambulance here in no time,
miss. Everything's gonna be OK.

1136
01:33:07,644 --> 01:33:10,264
Where are those goddamn red lights?!

1137
01:33:10,604 --> 01:33:12,312
Oh, God!

1138
01:33:14,816 --> 01:33:15,646
Stop!

1139
01:33:22,616 --> 01:33:23,861
There has to be.

1140
01:33:26,245 --> 01:33:30,194
It's headin' to the South Ferry loop!
It must be goin' about 70mph!

1141
01:33:36,087 --> 01:33:38,127
My God! Look!

1142
01:33:40,132 --> 01:33:41,792
We'll never make it!

1143
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:20,367
I told you it would stop. Didn't I?

1144
01:34:23,423 --> 01:34:25,581
42nd Street already?

1145
01:34:26,509 --> 01:34:29,925
Get that list out on the wire.
Tell 'em it's top priority.

1146
01:34:30,055 --> 01:34:32,011
Whaddaya got, Rico?

1147
01:34:32,139 --> 01:34:36,268
We got positive identification
on the three dead men. Here.

1148
01:34:39,271 --> 01:34:42,059
George Steever. Professional guy, huh?

1149
01:34:42,275 --> 01:34:45,358
- St Louis.
- Yeah, I know how to read, Rico.

1150
01:34:46,236 --> 01:34:50,103
Giuseppe Benvenuto,
alias - heh-heh - Joe Welcome.

1151
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:52,861
- Where's the guy who fried himself?
- No card on him.

1152
01:34:53,076 --> 01:34:55,863
We got a confirm on his prints
from Immigration.

1153
01:34:55,995 --> 01:35:01,499
Name's Bernard Ryder. Mercenary
soldier. Between wars, I guess.

1154
01:35:01,625 --> 01:35:06,288
None of these guys know how to drive
a train. It's the motorman who's missin'.

1155
01:35:06,423 --> 01:35:09,625
Did you get that list of motormen
who were discharged?

1156
01:35:09,759 --> 01:35:11,798
Yeah. 78 names.

1157
01:35:11,928 --> 01:35:13,089
78?

1158
01:35:13,220 --> 01:35:15,462
Yeah, but it's not that bad.

1159
01:35:15,597 --> 01:35:18,433
Eight are dead. 22 were rehired.

1160
01:35:18,559 --> 01:35:20,598
11 are in jail.

1161
01:35:21,770 --> 01:35:23,810
26 moved away.

1162
01:35:24,689 --> 01:35:28,687
One's in a mental institution. Another
is a member of the Police Department.

1163
01:35:28,818 --> 01:35:31,439
That's our man right there.

1164
01:35:31,570 --> 01:35:35,271
Sorry to disappoint you, Zachary,
but he was accounted for.

1165
01:35:35,408 --> 01:35:38,077
- So how many does that leave?
- Only nine.

1166
01:35:38,577 --> 01:35:41,828
Only nine. All right, let's get goin'.

1167
01:35:44,625 --> 01:35:46,867
What's the name of this guy?

1168
01:35:47,002 --> 01:35:49,041
Nathaniel Muscat.

1169
01:35:50,005 --> 01:35:53,006
- What'd he get busted for?
- Narcotics.

1170
01:36:00,139 --> 01:36:02,179
This way.

1171
01:36:11,983 --> 01:36:15,104
- Who's there?
- Transit Police.

1172
01:36:15,237 --> 01:36:17,277
Just a minute.

1173
01:36:20,701 --> 01:36:22,740
What do you want?

1174
01:36:26,539 --> 01:36:29,375
Uh, nothin', fella. Our mistake.

1175
01:36:30,793 --> 01:36:32,952
A spokesman for the Transit Authority

1176
01:36:33,087 --> 01:36:35,578
noted that the subway car
carrying the hostages

1177
01:36:35,714 --> 01:36:40,211
was stopped at the South Ferry loop
by the automatic safety features

1178
01:36:40,344 --> 01:36:44,044
which are activated by any car
travelling at excessive speed.

1179
01:36:44,431 --> 01:36:47,882
- Transit Authority.
- Still gotta pay.

1180
01:36:48,143 --> 01:36:50,349
- Your name is Latimer?
- What about it?

1181
01:36:50,479 --> 01:36:52,887
Just answer the question, would ya?

1182
01:36:53,023 --> 01:36:57,483
I don't work for you guys any more.
You don't get shit from me.

1183
01:36:58,945 --> 01:37:02,990
Can you account for your
whereabouts today, Mr Latimer?

1184
01:37:03,116 --> 01:37:06,650
Are you tryin' to connect me
to that hijackin'? Forget it!

1185
01:37:07,036 --> 01:37:09,574
I've been here since 2.30 this afternoon.

1186
01:37:09,705 --> 01:37:12,575
- Are you sure?
- Sure? Ask anybody!

1187
01:37:13,125 --> 01:37:16,292
- Don't worry, we will.
- Hold it!

1188
01:37:16,504 --> 01:37:18,792
It's still gonna be 50 cents.

1189
01:37:41,902 --> 01:37:44,144
- Who's that?
- Police Department.

1190
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:48,146
- Who?
- Harold Longman, it's the Transit Police.

1191
01:37:48,450 --> 01:37:49,861
Oh, Jesus!

1192
01:37:50,536 --> 01:37:51,947
Wait a minute!

1193
01:37:56,708 --> 01:37:59,163
Just a minute!

1194
01:38:02,672 --> 01:38:06,883
- How many more we gotta see today?
- Six, seven. I don't know.

1195
01:38:11,054 --> 01:38:14,839
Come on, Mr Longman,
we ain't got all night!

1196
01:38:18,729 --> 01:38:20,887
I'll be right out!

1197
01:38:22,690 --> 01:38:26,274
I hope he washes his hands
before he opens the door.

1198
01:38:34,285 --> 01:38:36,527
- Yes, what is it?
- Harold Longman?

1199
01:38:36,662 --> 01:38:39,746
- We'd like to ask a couple of questions.
- What about?

1200
01:38:39,873 --> 01:38:44,121
- Will you let us in?
- We'll just take one minute of your time.

1201
01:38:46,671 --> 01:38:49,293
I'm Lieutenant Patrone.
This is Lieutenant Garber.

1202
01:38:49,424 --> 01:38:51,879
I'm sorry to bother you like this.

1203
01:38:53,011 --> 01:38:56,546
- Nice place you got here, Mr Longman.
- Thanks.

1204
01:38:57,264 --> 01:39:01,097
Can you give us an account of
your whereabouts this afternoon?

1205
01:39:01,227 --> 01:39:02,093
Why?

1206
01:39:02,228 --> 01:39:04,101
- Were you at work?
- No.

1207
01:39:04,647 --> 01:39:07,565
- Why not?
- I work nights.

1208
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:10,521
- Where do you work?
- Kennedy Airport.

1209
01:39:10,652 --> 01:39:14,780
- What do you do over there?
- I'm a... fork-lift operator.

1210
01:39:14,906 --> 01:39:17,860
I got a brother-in-law does that
over in Jersey.

1211
01:39:17,993 --> 01:39:20,069
That's interestin' work.

1212
01:39:20,204 --> 01:39:23,406
Where were you this afternoon,
Mr Longman?

1213
01:39:23,665 --> 01:39:26,370
- Why?
- You tell me where, I'll tell you why.

1214
01:39:26,959 --> 01:39:29,629
I was, uh... right here.

1215
01:39:29,837 --> 01:39:32,707
Can anyone verify that fact?

1216
01:39:34,592 --> 01:39:36,632
You said you'd tell me why.

1217
01:39:37,345 --> 01:39:41,212
- You were here all afternoon?
- I sleep in the afternoon.

1218
01:39:41,348 --> 01:39:45,760
- All afternoon?
- Well... till about an hour ago.

1219
01:39:48,438 --> 01:39:51,392
- But you heard about the hijackin'?
- What hijackin'?

1220
01:39:52,067 --> 01:39:54,854
- The subway train.
- Subway...!

1221
01:39:56,029 --> 01:39:59,943
- You gotta be kiddin'!
- Do I look like I'm kiddin'?

1222
01:40:00,074 --> 01:40:04,154
I mean, would I be here
if I was kiddin', mister?

1223
01:40:04,286 --> 01:40:07,122
Subway...! Who'd wanna
do a thing like that?

1224
01:40:07,248 --> 01:40:10,035
- Hey, Z. You got a match?
- No.

1225
01:40:10,167 --> 01:40:12,243
- You got a warrant?
- No.

1226
01:40:12,378 --> 01:40:16,209
Supreme Court says you have to have
a warrant, unless I'm under arrest.

1227
01:40:16,340 --> 01:40:21,131
The way things are goin', they're gonna
be changin' that in about 10 minutes.

1228
01:40:21,261 --> 01:40:23,966
- Mr Longman, you got a match?
- No.

1229
01:40:24,097 --> 01:40:27,300
That's all right. I'll get it at the stove.

1230
01:40:27,433 --> 01:40:29,889
I'll get it.

1231
01:40:30,019 --> 01:40:32,261
It's a little tricky.

1232
01:40:33,981 --> 01:40:36,437
Has a tendency to explode.

1233
01:40:39,653 --> 01:40:41,527
Rico, let's go.

1234
01:40:41,655 --> 01:40:43,980
Thanks, Mr Longman.

1235
01:40:44,825 --> 01:40:46,817
Mr Longman, we'll be back later.

1236
01:40:46,952 --> 01:40:50,996
Yeah? Listen, I know I got a gripe
with the TA. I know I got a bum rap.

1237
01:40:51,122 --> 01:40:54,574
But I wouldn't do anythin' as stupid
as what you just told me.

1238
01:40:54,710 --> 01:40:59,003
What do think I am? A jerk? Do me a
favour, will ya? Get the hell outta here.

1239
01:40:59,130 --> 01:41:02,415
Come on, Mr Longman. We have
to follow our leads. It's our job!

1240
01:41:02,550 --> 01:41:04,092
Yeah, yeah. Big deal.

1241
01:41:04,218 --> 01:41:08,761
Look, I got my rights. This is my home.
I want a little peace!

1242
01:41:08,889 --> 01:41:11,463
Just do me a favour.
Get the hell outta here.

1243
01:41:11,809 --> 01:41:13,967
Sorry if we bothered ya, Mr Longman.

1244
01:41:14,436 --> 01:41:15,599
Come on, Rico.

1245
01:41:15,729 --> 01:41:17,556
- Atchoo!
- Gesundheit!
