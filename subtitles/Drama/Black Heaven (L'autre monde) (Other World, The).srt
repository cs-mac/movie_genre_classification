1
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,210
Sam!

2
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:13,247
Sam!

3
00:01:13,341 --> 00:01:15,116
Wait for me!

4
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:19,254
Come on.

5
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:48,212
"BLACK HEAVEN"

6
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,822
C'mon, Marion!

7
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:18,478
What's the time?

8
00:02:18,573 --> 00:02:20,075
Shit, he'll be furious!

9
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:21,278
What's up?

10
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:24,288
My dad's due back,
and the place is a mess.

11
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:25,948
Can I come with you?

12
00:02:26,047 --> 00:02:27,890
All right.

13
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,658
What are you doing?

14
00:02:33,755 --> 00:02:35,359
What's up?

15
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:02,324
Marion?

16
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,919
Gaspard?

17
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:34,789
You'll be late.

18
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:37,055
That's your fault.

19
00:04:04,212 --> 00:04:05,122
Sam?

20
00:04:05,213 --> 00:04:06,453
Yes.

21
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:09,494
Sam, it's Dragon.

22
00:04:09,584 --> 00:04:11,928
I wanted to hear your voice.

23
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:18,031
I was wrong to call.

24
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:26,172
- What are you doing?
- Looking.

25
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:32,040
We have to return it.

26
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,949
Or you keep it.

27
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,162
Shit, they're back.

28
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:30,232
I'll call you.

29
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:46,215
What did you do?
You ate her out.

30
00:05:46,314 --> 00:05:47,486
Ignore him.

31
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,322
I Won't Waste my breath.

32
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:51,124
Did she blow you or not?

33
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:54,131
Lucio, you've got a dirty mouth!

34
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:55,564
Blowing isn't dirty.

35
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:57,363
It is.
Your language too.

36
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,368
Cut it out!

37
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:00,803
- I just want to...
- Enough!

38
00:06:00,895 --> 00:06:02,340
I'm not answering.

39
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:06,606
What did you do, then?
You just kissed?

40
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:07,771
You're in love?

41
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,108
- Lucio...
-Yeah.

42
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:10,443
Shut the hell up.

43
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:13,678
See that, I got him!
You're in love!

44
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:14,912
That true?

45
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:16,317
It's why they didn't fuck.

46
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,083
Conversation over, thanks.

47
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:20,125
You're a sly one.

48
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:21,887
Coming to Memo's with us?

49
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:22,927
I can't.

50
00:06:23,017 --> 00:06:25,293
I promised to repaint
the hallway.

51
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:26,490
Repaint it?

52
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:27,497
Need a hand?

53
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:29,431
Over my dead body!

54
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:32,060
You can ask Marion instead.

55
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,297
Gaspard...

56
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:35,340
Okay, We're going.

57
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:37,136
See you.

58
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:39,802
I Want the smutty details!

59
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,846
See you!

60
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:17,843
"Sorry I called.
I'll meet you as arranged.

61
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,440
From: Dragon"

62
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:21,719
Did you reply?

63
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:22,947
No.

64
00:07:23,044 --> 00:07:24,250
Any old messages?

65
00:07:24,345 --> 00:07:26,291
You want me to check?

66
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,883
Yes.

67
00:07:28,983 --> 00:07:31,190
Hold on.

68
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,293
I'll read them.

69
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:42,340
"Insomnia I feel Weird.
I'd like to talk to you."

70
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,240
"No, I'm not scared."

71
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:47,676
"With you, yes.
I think I love you."

72
00:07:47,768 --> 00:07:49,247
That's all?

73
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:52,806
I'll check what she sent.

74
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:55,285
"Meet me on Black Hole."

75
00:07:55,376 --> 00:07:57,856
- What's Black Hole?
- No idea.

76
00:07:57,945 --> 00:07:59,481
Another one...

77
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,924
"Saturday, 6:00 pm.,
at the chapel.

78
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:03,393
"We'll get what we need.

79
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:07,899
"We'll be together."
Signed Sam.

80
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,558
When was it sent?

81
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:11,568
This afternoon at 1:00.

82
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:13,639
Saturdays tomorrow.
I'm free.

83
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:15,206
You want to go?

84
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:43,731
What's the time?

85
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:44,825
6230.

86
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:46,996
Maybe it's too late.

87
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:48,869
Want to go back?

88
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:51,204
No.

89
00:08:57,071 --> 00:08:58,607
I know what Black Hole is.

90
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:00,686
You do?

91
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:01,946
What is it?

92
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,385
Guess.

93
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:05,115
Tell me, what is it?

94
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:08,250
It's just an online game.

95
00:09:08,349 --> 00:09:11,262
-You played?
- No, you have to buy the DVD.

96
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:32,746
That's Sam.

97
00:09:47,488 --> 00:09:48,899
That's Dragon.

98
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,634
They've never met.

99
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:02,543
How can you be sure?

100
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:04,479
I don't know, but I'm sure.

101
00:11:49,243 --> 00:11:50,221
I'll follow him.

102
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:51,619
You're sure?

103
00:12:40,661 --> 00:12:42,140
You hear me?

104
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:43,674
I'm following him.

105
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,936
He's got rolls of tape.

106
00:12:47,735 --> 00:12:48,907
What for?

107
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:50,709
No idea.

108
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:58,414
He's in the plumbing aisle now.

109
00:12:58,512 --> 00:13:00,822
He's looking at pipes.

110
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,033
He's picked one.

111
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:14,697
It's a sort of plastic tube.

112
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:27,251
Hold on.
I can't see him.

113
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:51,740
- Okay?
- Come on.

114
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:27,603
We lost them.

115
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:31,574
Disappointed?

116
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:33,372
No, it was nice.

117
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:34,810
That's true.

118
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,414
It's so wonderful, Marion.

119
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:21,656
I love you.

120
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:24,422
Don't say it
if it's not true or it's...

121
00:16:24,518 --> 00:16:26,828
it's what?

122
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,558
It's bad luck.

123
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,131
It's true, I swear.

124
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:35,229
I Wouldn't lie to you.

125
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,400
It's the truth.

126
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:49,220
What's that?

127
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:01,724
It's not locked!

128
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:36,850
He's dead!

129
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,428
She's breathing!

130
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,483
- What?
- Someone's there!

131
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:10,319
Anybody there?

132
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,731
Is anybody there?

133
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:43,717
That's my dad.

134
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,987
Good evening.

135
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:12,249
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

136
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:13,551
Need a ride?

137
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:16,423
I have to get the scooter back.

138
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:19,053
Marion says your parents
are away.

139
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:23,100
They're in Spain with my sister.

140
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:27,104
Don't worry.
it's a shock, but we'll be okay.

141
00:20:27,194 --> 00:20:29,299
All right.

142
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:06,337
We'll fall asleep
and float in the clouds.

143
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:11,269
Give me plenty.

144
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:25,185
Here.

145
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,558
Tell me you love me.

146
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:31,287
I love you, Sam.

147
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:43,164
We're going far away.

148
00:22:43,263 --> 00:22:44,333
To the Black Beach.

149
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:46,206
Yeah.

150
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:48,176
To the Black Beach.

151
00:22:57,744 --> 00:22:59,781
We're going away together.

152
00:23:17,297 --> 00:23:19,800
Isn't working a drag
while we hang out?

153
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:23,711
No, I love being in a booth
as cars pass by!

154
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:25,612
It must be hell.

155
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:26,740
You learn a lot.

156
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,342
Yeah?
Such as?

157
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:30,978
Some people are nice;
others aren't.

158
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,556
Great discovery!

159
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:35,819
They're two different species.
Nice ones are always pleasant.

160
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,054
The others,
always nasty and dumb.

161
00:23:38,151 --> 00:23:39,528
I'm a nice guy.

162
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:40,791
No way!

163
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:44,835
You're the kind
Who'd try to grab my hand.

164
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,267
Some do that?

165
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:50,739
Some even flash you their dick
at the tollgate

166
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,242
Are you nuts?
I'm not like that.

167
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:56,177
You are.
You think with your cock!

168
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:04,288
Here you go.
Bang on time.

169
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:17,433
Marion's great.

170
00:24:17,524 --> 00:24:19,697
I mean it.
She's cute, friendly...

171
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:20,703
Smart too.

172
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:23,502
Yeah, dead smart.

173
00:24:23,596 --> 00:24:25,075
She's a great girl.

174
00:24:25,165 --> 00:24:27,042
I think so too.

175
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:30,012
I hope the four of us
stay friends.

176
00:24:30,103 --> 00:24:31,707
How do you mean?

177
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:35,685
Well, now Marion and you
are together.

178
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:37,311
That changes nothing.

179
00:24:58,364 --> 00:25:00,173
How do you run?

180
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:11,416
I'm looking for a girl.

181
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:13,218
This is the place.

182
00:25:13,313 --> 00:25:16,624
But Watch out.
2,-'13 of the girls are guys.

183
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:19,925
Some are cute, though.

184
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,056
I know her already.

185
00:25:22,155 --> 00:25:23,498
What's her username?

186
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,399
Sam, I think

187
00:25:25,492 --> 00:25:27,335
There are loads of Sams.

188
00:25:27,427 --> 00:25:29,031
Where does she hang out?

189
00:25:29,129 --> 00:25:30,437
No idea.

190
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,601
You don't have a clue, huh?

191
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:36,478
Answer.

192
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:38,606
Don't be afraid.

193
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:56,131
Go on, answer.

194
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:07,506
Want to fuck her?

195
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,943
I understood.

196
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:10,013
What do I say?

197
00:26:10,103 --> 00:26:12,743
Say yes. You'll see.

198
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,446
Too expensive.
She's nuts!

199
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,456
Shit...

200
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:33,763
Shit!

201
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,804
She killed you?

202
00:26:34,894 --> 00:26:36,567
She sent me to Purgatory.

203
00:26:36,663 --> 00:26:39,769
A real drag,
hours to get back.

204
00:26:39,866 --> 00:26:40,776
Sorry.

205
00:26:40,867 --> 00:26:42,642
Hey, that's life.

206
00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:44,806
Do you like it?

207
00:26:56,516 --> 00:26:58,120
What shall we do?

208
00:26:58,218 --> 00:26:59,288
You choose.

209
00:26:59,385 --> 00:27:01,228
Come see something at my place?

210
00:27:01,321 --> 00:27:02,664
Yeah, okay.

211
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:04,564
You can even sleep over.

212
00:27:05,992 --> 00:27:07,903
No.

213
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,774
My clad Won't let me.

214
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:14,810
I know him.
He freaks out.

215
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:36,433
What a drag!
He won't let me.

216
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:37,432
What did he say?

217
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:39,696
That I have to go home.

218
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:42,033
He's a pain.
He's totally anal!

219
00:28:03,616 --> 00:28:06,028
Gaspard!

220
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:08,224
- Can I have a word?
- What for?

221
00:28:08,321 --> 00:28:11,200
I just want a word.
Leave us, please.

222
00:28:24,604 --> 00:28:26,242
She thinks I'm an old fart.

223
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:28,216
She never says that.

224
00:28:28,308 --> 00:28:29,412
Whatever.

225
00:28:29,509 --> 00:28:32,547
She asked to sleep
at your place.

226
00:28:32,645 --> 00:28:36,024
I said no.
I don't think it's a good idea.

227
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:37,423
What do you think?

228
00:28:37,517 --> 00:28:39,087
About...

229
00:28:39,185 --> 00:28:43,600
Is it a good idea
for her to stay the night?

230
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:46,330
I don't know.
Yes.

231
00:28:46,426 --> 00:28:48,736
I'm her father.

232
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:51,399
A father protects his daughter.

233
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:55,468
You must be reasonable.

234
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:58,447
- We are reasonable.
- Good.

235
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:03,080
You mustn't worry.
We're not kids.

236
00:29:03,176 --> 00:29:05,417
We're careful.

237
00:29:05,511 --> 00:29:07,286
Careful?

238
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,721
Careful of what?

239
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:17,268
Everything.

240
00:29:17,357 --> 00:29:19,997
You think she's in danger?

241
00:29:22,729 --> 00:29:25,505
You're talking
about contraception?

242
00:29:28,935 --> 00:29:32,906
It's not just about
contraception.

243
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:37,181
Marion is a lot more fragile
than she seems.

244
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:40,120
She's very fond of you.

245
00:29:40,213 --> 00:29:41,283
What about you?

246
00:29:41,381 --> 00:29:43,122
Are you fond of her?

247
00:29:43,216 --> 00:29:44,923
Yes, of course.

248
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:47,224
I have nothing against you.

249
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,358
I'm sure
you're a fine young man.

250
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:52,766
But I remember being young once.

251
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:55,339
I don't want Marion to suffer.

252
00:29:55,428 --> 00:29:59,240
- You understand?
- I think so.

253
00:29:59,332 --> 00:30:01,539
So think about it.

254
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:26,993
We're going far away.

255
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:28,504
To the Black Beach.

256
00:30:28,594 --> 00:30:30,130
Yeah.

257
00:30:30,229 --> 00:30:32,436
To the Black Beach.

258
00:30:41,541 --> 00:30:43,817
We're going away together.

259
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:42,144
Lucio, shit!

260
00:31:42,235 --> 00:31:43,714
Okay if I take a break?

261
00:31:43,803 --> 00:31:45,214
What for?

262
00:31:45,304 --> 00:31:47,341
I need to pick something up.

263
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,646
Something?

264
00:31:59,452 --> 00:32:00,988
Coming up with me?

265
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:02,464
- No.
- Thanks, Yann.

266
00:32:02,555 --> 00:32:04,091
That's no surprise.

267
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,567
Gaspard?

268
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:11,238
You guys suck.

269
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:14,209
You're not letting me go
on my own?

270
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:21,575
- Okay, let's go.
- All right!

271
00:32:21,674 --> 00:32:24,484
I know who my true friends are!

272
00:33:07,687 --> 00:33:08,961
Hi.
Okay?

273
00:33:09,055 --> 00:33:10,762
Good.
And you?

274
00:33:10,856 --> 00:33:12,836
You said to stop by.

275
00:33:12,925 --> 00:33:13,926
Want a beer?

276
00:33:14,026 --> 00:33:17,667
Why not?

277
00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:20,175
Not for you?

278
00:33:29,141 --> 00:33:30,586
I don't see you much.

279
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:32,553
I'm kind of hard up right now.

280
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:40,488
Can I sit down?

281
00:33:46,726 --> 00:33:49,104
Try this.

282
00:34:07,013 --> 00:34:08,583
It's good.

283
00:34:08,681 --> 00:34:12,185
Gimme a break.
it's the best shit ever!

284
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,797
Where's the toilet?

285
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,960
Second on the right.

286
00:35:20,252 --> 00:35:21,253
Sorry!

287
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:23,355
I should have closed the door.

288
00:35:25,925 --> 00:35:27,996
Stay, I don't mind.

289
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,506
What's your name?

290
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:37,103
Gaspard.

291
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,879
Are you a pal of Vincent's?

292
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:45,285
No, I came with a friend
to see Samoa

293
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:46,685
Samos is a jerk.

294
00:35:46,779 --> 00:35:49,191
All Vincent's pals are jerks.

295
00:35:49,281 --> 00:35:51,124
I know you.

296
00:35:51,217 --> 00:35:54,858
What?
Where from?

297
00:35:54,954 --> 00:35:56,695
I'm the one
who found you at the quarry.

298
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:05,369
Come with me.

299
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,639
Want to hear
the most beautiful song ever?

300
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:40,233
They'll wonder where I am.

301
00:36:40,332 --> 00:36:42,505
Forget them.

302
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:50,612
Close your eyes.

303
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,518
It's better
with your eyes closed.

304
00:38:09,321 --> 00:38:11,062
You saw it?

305
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:13,227
- What?
- My tattoo.

306
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:15,669
You were looking at it before,
right?

307
00:38:15,761 --> 00:38:16,762
Yes.

308
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:18,637
Want to see it?

309
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,314
Know what it means?

310
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:32,013
Heaven.

311
00:38:32,111 --> 00:38:34,091
Touch it if you want.

312
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:42,429
See, it makes a kind of bump.

313
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,562
Can you keep a secret?

314
00:38:56,435 --> 00:38:58,676
You know Black Hole?

315
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:05,212
I thought you went for a piss!

316
00:39:05,311 --> 00:39:07,052
Knock, asshole!

317
00:39:24,129 --> 00:39:25,403
What's up, Audrey?

318
00:39:25,497 --> 00:39:27,602
We can't listen to music now?

319
00:39:29,268 --> 00:39:31,214
Watch your tone with me.

320
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:34,509
Who's he?

321
00:39:35,941 --> 00:39:37,943
No one.

322
00:39:38,544 --> 00:39:40,785
No one?

323
00:39:42,815 --> 00:39:44,590
Come here, you.

324
00:39:53,926 --> 00:39:55,997
She's my sister.

325
00:39:56,095 --> 00:39:57,938
She's not well.

326
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:00,135
She just got
out of the hospital.

327
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:01,802
You understand?

328
00:40:03,669 --> 00:40:05,706
What were you doing?

329
00:40:05,804 --> 00:40:08,341
Nothing.
We were talking.

330
00:40:12,211 --> 00:40:13,884
Just go.

331
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:18,191
Got that?
Get lost.

332
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:20,388
It's okay.
He's leaving.

333
00:40:26,892 --> 00:40:28,599
- What happened?
- Nothing.

334
00:40:28,694 --> 00:40:30,230
What were you doing?

335
00:40:30,329 --> 00:40:32,240
Nothing, listening to music.

336
00:40:32,331 --> 00:40:34,277
That's cool!

337
00:40:36,402 --> 00:40:40,282
She's the girl from the quarry.

338
00:40:40,372 --> 00:40:43,410
She is?

339
00:40:43,509 --> 00:40:46,854
You never said
she was beautiful.

340
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:48,925
Did you get her number?

341
00:40:50,516 --> 00:40:53,156
Did she give you
her number or not?

342
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:57,497
Fine, I'll ask Samos for it.

343
00:41:45,104 --> 00:41:46,640
My name's Gordon.

344
00:42:58,944 --> 00:43:01,550
Need help?

345
00:43:01,647 --> 00:43:03,991
No, thanks. I'm okay.

346
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:05,755
Want to work for me?

347
00:43:08,287 --> 00:43:11,632
I'll give you threads.
it's chilly here.

348
00:43:11,723 --> 00:43:13,202
You can get rich with me.

349
00:43:13,292 --> 00:43:14,862
Filthy rich.

350
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,439
Thanks, I don't need money.

351
00:43:16,528 --> 00:43:18,371
Of course you do!

352
00:43:18,463 --> 00:43:19,635
Everyone needs money!

353
00:43:19,731 --> 00:43:22,405
You can't stay naked like that.

354
00:43:22,501 --> 00:43:24,845
Do you know a girl called Sam?

355
00:43:24,937 --> 00:43:26,280
Sam?

356
00:43:26,371 --> 00:43:28,146
Noi don't know/ a Sam.

357
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,151
Work for me to meet people.

358
00:43:32,144 --> 00:43:35,216
Sell these creatures.

359
00:43:50,062 --> 00:43:52,064
How much?

360
00:43:52,164 --> 00:43:55,873
Ordinary ones: 50 units.
Singing ones: 150.

361
00:43:59,338 --> 00:44:00,942
We'll take one.

362
00:44:15,053 --> 00:44:17,659
Thank you.

363
00:44:24,796 --> 00:44:26,002
Excuse me!

364
00:44:26,098 --> 00:44:27,634
Are you Sam?

365
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:31,145
No, I'm not Sam.

366
00:44:31,236 --> 00:44:33,113
It's because of your tattoo:
Heaven.

367
00:44:33,205 --> 00:44:36,015
It's a slave tattoo, honey.

368
00:44:36,108 --> 00:44:40,147
Maybe your friend Sam
is a slave of Heaven too?

369
00:44:40,245 --> 00:44:43,124
A slave of Heaven?

370
00:44:43,215 --> 00:44:45,923
What's that?

371
00:44:46,018 --> 00:44:50,125
Really?
You don't know Heaven, honey?

372
00:45:33,131 --> 00:45:34,735
Good evening, sir.

373
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:36,506
May I come in?

374
00:45:36,601 --> 00:45:38,171
Your card, please.

375
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:40,147
I'm looking for someone.

376
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:41,546
Are you a member?

377
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,745
No, I'm a friend of Sam's.

378
00:45:43,842 --> 00:45:45,617
Piss off!

379
00:45:50,148 --> 00:45:51,855
Piss off!

380
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:06,602
Yeah, Lucio.

381
00:46:06,698 --> 00:46:09,474
Were you asleep?

382
00:46:09,568 --> 00:46:11,377
Get over here, it's wild!

383
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:12,380
Wild!

384
00:46:12,471 --> 00:46:14,883
Where?
What's that shouting?

385
00:46:14,973 --> 00:46:17,681
Get your ass over here.
You'll freak!

386
00:46:17,776 --> 00:46:19,517
You sound weird.
Are you blasted?

387
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:21,522
Yes!

388
00:46:21,613 --> 00:46:23,286
Is Yann with you?

389
00:46:23,382 --> 00:46:26,090
Yeah.
Audrey's here too.

390
00:46:26,184 --> 00:46:27,185
Audrey's there?

391
00:46:42,734 --> 00:46:45,044
- These guys are sick.
- What's going on?

392
00:46:45,137 --> 00:46:47,515
Some crazy face-off.

393
00:47:24,576 --> 00:47:26,817
About time.

394
00:47:26,912 --> 00:47:28,255
Want to try?

395
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:31,122
Not particularly.

396
00:47:31,216 --> 00:47:34,595
Samos has won, then!

397
00:47:34,686 --> 00:47:36,029
What?

398
00:47:36,121 --> 00:47:39,159
- Someone's cheating!
- Who's cheating?

399
00:47:39,257 --> 00:47:41,737
I only had two goes.
I get a third.

400
00:47:43,128 --> 00:47:46,871
What does the ref say?

401
00:47:46,965 --> 00:47:48,308
He gets another go.

402
00:47:51,303 --> 00:47:53,579
I'm warning you, I'm not moving!

403
00:47:53,672 --> 00:47:56,812
You'll have to swerve!

404
00:47:56,908 --> 00:47:59,184
- Want to get run down?
- Sure!

405
00:47:59,277 --> 00:48:01,223
- Enough, you're blasted.
- Yeah, let's stop.

406
00:48:01,313 --> 00:48:02,792
No one's stopping.

407
00:48:02,881 --> 00:48:04,451
What's up?

408
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:07,428
Got no balls?
You're safe in the car.

409
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:08,896
Cut it out, Lucio.

410
00:48:08,987 --> 00:48:11,092
Mind your own damn business,
Yann!

411
00:48:11,189 --> 00:48:12,429
Go on, get going.

412
00:48:12,524 --> 00:48:14,697
You'll swerve to miss me.

413
00:48:14,793 --> 00:48:15,897
Maybe I won't.

414
00:48:15,994 --> 00:48:18,338
You don't scare me.

415
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:20,341
I'll crush you like a hamster.

416
00:48:20,432 --> 00:48:23,072
- Stop, this is totally dumb.
- Get in.

417
00:48:23,168 --> 00:48:25,910
- What?
- Get in. I want a word.

418
00:49:16,254 --> 00:49:18,598
Did Audrey thank you
for finding her?

419
00:49:21,226 --> 00:49:23,502
You should thank him.

420
00:49:23,595 --> 00:49:25,768
You're still here
because of him.

421
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:30,002
-Thank him.
- it's okay; there's no need.

422
00:49:30,101 --> 00:49:32,274
There is.

423
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:34,213
Without you, she'd be dead.

424
00:49:34,306 --> 00:49:36,684
Come on, Audrey.

425
00:49:36,775 --> 00:49:37,913
Say thank you.

426
00:49:38,009 --> 00:49:40,216
Thank you.

427
00:49:40,312 --> 00:49:42,349
Fucking better than that!

428
00:49:42,447 --> 00:49:44,688
He saved your life!

429
00:49:50,589 --> 00:49:52,159
Thanks for saving my life.

430
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:56,435
There.

431
00:49:56,528 --> 00:49:59,566
That's better.

432
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:02,508
Now kiss him.

433
00:50:23,488 --> 00:50:26,560
Audrey had a camera in the car
that night.

434
00:50:26,658 --> 00:50:29,298
A small DV camera.

435
00:50:29,394 --> 00:50:31,374
Did you find it?

436
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,204
Are you sure?

437
00:50:36,301 --> 00:50:38,611
Yeah, positive.

438
00:50:41,172 --> 00:50:43,083
Maybe your friend took it?

439
00:50:43,174 --> 00:50:47,054
Marion?
No, she'd have told me.

440
00:50:47,145 --> 00:50:49,523
Yeah.
You're probably right.

441
00:51:23,982 --> 00:51:25,518
- Are you okay?
- Fine, fine...

442
00:51:25,617 --> 00:51:28,393
You're sure?

443
00:51:28,486 --> 00:51:30,659
See?
You jumped.

444
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:32,291
You nearly killed him!

445
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:34,927
I knew he'd jump.

446
00:51:35,026 --> 00:51:36,403
He said he wouldn't!

447
00:51:36,494 --> 00:51:38,132
But he did.

448
00:51:38,229 --> 00:51:39,765
Asshole!

449
00:51:39,864 --> 00:51:41,400
What?

450
00:51:41,499 --> 00:51:42,842
You're an asshole!

451
00:51:48,406 --> 00:51:50,249
Okay, let's split!

452
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:51,877
The party's over!

453
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:45,134
Please, sir.

454
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:46,231
Yes?

455
00:52:46,331 --> 00:52:47,901
Can I see your member card?

456
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:50,206
What?

457
00:52:50,301 --> 00:52:53,805
I need to see your card, please.

458
00:52:53,905 --> 00:52:54,883
What's wrong?

459
00:52:54,973 --> 00:52:56,179
You from the club?

460
00:52:56,274 --> 00:52:58,015
Yes.

461
00:52:58,109 --> 00:52:59,952
No, you're not.

462
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:34,823
Good evening, sir.

463
00:53:34,913 --> 00:53:37,257
Thank you.

464
00:53:37,348 --> 00:53:39,954
Enjoy yourself, sir.

465
00:55:45,476 --> 00:55:47,046
Wait!
Don't shoot!

466
00:55:47,145 --> 00:55:49,352
You're Sam, right?

467
00:55:50,915 --> 00:55:53,361
Yes.
What do you want?

468
00:55:53,451 --> 00:55:55,226
To congratulate you.

469
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,300
A new member?
I never saw you.

470
00:55:57,388 --> 00:55:59,231
I'm not a member.

471
00:56:01,125 --> 00:56:02,832
How did you get in?

472
00:56:04,228 --> 00:56:06,606
Sit down.

473
00:56:12,637 --> 00:56:14,275
How do you know me?

474
00:56:14,372 --> 00:56:16,511
Dragon told me about you.

475
00:56:16,607 --> 00:56:17,779
You know Dragon?

476
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:20,651
I sold him a pet.
We hit it off.

477
00:56:22,013 --> 00:56:24,994
That's what you do?
You sell pets?

478
00:56:25,083 --> 00:56:27,359
Yes.

479
00:56:27,452 --> 00:56:29,762
What did Dragon say about me?

480
00:56:29,854 --> 00:56:32,357
Not a lot.
That you sang Well.

481
00:56:32,457 --> 00:56:33,595
That's all?

482
00:56:35,793 --> 00:56:38,706
He said he wanted
to die with you.

483
00:56:38,796 --> 00:56:41,367
He told you that?

484
00:56:41,466 --> 00:56:43,241
I never saw him again.

485
00:56:43,334 --> 00:56:45,974
He's dead.

486
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:47,708
What's your name?

487
00:56:47,805 --> 00:56:49,478
Gordon.

488
00:56:49,574 --> 00:56:53,044
Nice to meet you, Gordon.

489
00:56:53,144 --> 00:56:55,090
I have to get changed.

490
00:57:08,393 --> 00:57:09,371
Gaspard?

491
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,440
You don't want
to see me anymore?

492
00:57:11,529 --> 00:57:14,942
- What time is it?
- 5:30.

493
00:57:15,033 --> 00:57:16,876
Sorry.
Need me to pick you up?

494
00:57:16,968 --> 00:57:20,381
No, I took the bus.
Can I come over?

495
00:57:20,471 --> 00:57:21,950
Yeah, sure.

496
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,576
Will I see you tonight?

497
00:57:23,674 --> 00:57:24,584
Yes.

498
00:57:24,675 --> 00:57:26,086
Gaspard?

499
00:57:26,177 --> 00:57:27,281
Are you listening?

500
00:57:27,378 --> 00:57:28,482
I'm listening.

501
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:29,853
Come at midnight.

502
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:32,052
The guy you killed
will block his card.

503
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:35,688
Use the emergency door.
The password is "butterfly"

504
00:57:35,787 --> 00:57:37,528
- I'll come over, then.
- Butterfly.

505
00:57:37,622 --> 00:57:38,862
What?

506
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:40,902
Yes, come over.

507
00:57:40,992 --> 00:57:42,027
Okay, see you.

508
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:44,128
Take care.

509
00:57:44,228 --> 00:57:45,798
Gordon?

510
00:57:45,897 --> 00:57:48,878
Emergency door. Midnight.
Butterfly.

511
00:57:56,474 --> 00:58:00,422
Get some fancier clothes.
I have a reputation to keep up.

512
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,626
- Yann and Ludo aren't helping?
- Not today.

513
00:58:42,854 --> 00:58:44,731
What's up?

514
00:58:50,761 --> 00:58:53,708
Hold on.

515
00:58:59,904 --> 00:59:02,578
It's me.

516
00:59:02,673 --> 00:59:05,244
No, I'm at lngrid's.

517
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:08,119
She asked me to sleep over.

518
00:59:10,681 --> 00:59:12,524
You don't trust me?

519
00:59:12,617 --> 00:59:14,961
Want to talk to her mum?

520
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:20,699
Okay, tomorrow at midday.

521
00:59:21,993 --> 00:59:24,496
Sure you don't want
to talk to her mum?

522
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:29,643
Okay, see you tomorrow.

523
00:59:38,509 --> 00:59:39,954
You'll get messed up.

524
00:59:40,044 --> 00:59:41,580
Don't care.

525
00:59:46,551 --> 00:59:49,828
- Gaspard...
-Yes?

526
00:59:49,921 --> 00:59:52,731
I Want to make love with you.

527
01:03:52,496 --> 01:03:53,839
That was beautiful.

528
01:03:55,266 --> 01:03:57,507
I'd like to take you somewhere.

529
01:03:57,601 --> 01:03:59,603
Know the Black Beach?

530
01:03:59,703 --> 01:04:00,841
No.

531
01:04:00,938 --> 01:04:03,714
It's where you go
when you die here.

532
01:04:03,808 --> 01:04:06,516
- Purgatory?
- Yes. Already been there?

533
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:09,352
I thought people
stayed away from it.

534
01:04:09,447 --> 01:04:12,257
It's my favorite place.

535
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:14,727
Want to go with me?

536
01:04:14,819 --> 01:04:16,457
We'd need to die, then?

537
01:04:16,554 --> 01:04:19,034
Yes.
Follow me.

538
01:05:28,259 --> 01:05:30,466
I like it better here.

539
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:35,841
I'd like to disappear
and stay here for good.

540
01:05:38,102 --> 01:05:40,207
Dragon liked this place too.

541
01:05:40,304 --> 01:05:42,750
He wanted to disappear as well.

542
01:05:44,275 --> 01:05:46,881
We'd decided to do it together.

543
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:51,951
I should have died with him,

544
01:05:52,049 --> 01:05:55,428
but two kids found us,
and I'm still here.

545
01:05:55,519 --> 01:05:58,125
Are you mad at them?

546
01:05:58,222 --> 01:05:59,462
Who?

547
01:05:59,557 --> 01:06:02,060
The kids who found you.

548
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:03,968
Yes.

549
01:06:04,061 --> 01:06:07,770
We never asked them to.

550
01:06:07,865 --> 01:06:12,211
I saw the boy again recently.
I intrigue him.

551
01:06:12,303 --> 01:06:13,782
I think he's in love.

552
01:06:13,871 --> 01:06:15,475
Why do you say that?

553
01:06:15,573 --> 01:06:17,712
I can see it in his eyes.

554
01:06:17,808 --> 01:06:19,913
Do you like him?

555
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:21,887
No.

556
01:06:21,979 --> 01:06:24,550
He's too naive.

557
01:06:41,632 --> 01:06:44,442
Next time, I'll die.

558
01:06:44,535 --> 01:06:45,980
You'll try again?

559
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:47,811
Yes.

560
01:06:49,473 --> 01:06:52,044
Gordon?

561
01:06:52,142 --> 01:06:55,351
Ask me to do something for you.

562
01:06:55,446 --> 01:06:57,619
What do you mean?

563
01:06:57,715 --> 01:06:59,752
Put me to the test.

564
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:03,127
Tell me what to do in real life,
and I will.

565
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:05,097
In real life?

566
01:07:05,189 --> 01:07:07,692
Yes, the first thing
you think of.

567
01:07:07,791 --> 01:07:09,498
I'll do it.

568
01:07:09,593 --> 01:07:10,731
For you.

569
01:07:10,828 --> 01:07:12,501
Kiss that naive boy.

570
01:07:12,596 --> 01:07:13,540
What?

571
01:07:13,631 --> 01:07:15,736
Kiss him and sleep with him.

572
01:07:15,833 --> 01:07:17,278
Sleep with him?

573
01:07:17,368 --> 01:07:19,575
Yes.

574
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:22,207
That turns you on?

575
01:07:22,306 --> 01:07:23,785
Yes.

576
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:29,388
Okay, I'll do it.
I'll tell you about it.

577
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:32,120
Now what will you do for me?

578
01:07:32,216 --> 01:07:35,220
Want me to do something?

579
01:07:35,319 --> 01:07:39,062
Got a girlfriend?
Someone you're dating?

580
01:07:41,492 --> 01:07:43,802
No.

581
01:07:43,894 --> 01:07:46,033
I'm married.

582
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:48,076
Do you love her?

583
01:07:48,165 --> 01:07:50,008
Why do you want to know?

584
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:53,377
- Can't you guess?
- No.

585
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:55,882
I'd like you to hurt her.

586
01:07:58,542 --> 01:08:00,886
Does that shock you?

587
01:08:04,181 --> 01:08:05,285
But you'll do it.

588
01:08:05,382 --> 01:08:06,793
For me.

589
01:08:11,522 --> 01:08:13,729
Coming for a swim?

590
01:08:40,851 --> 01:08:42,956
Want to take your brother
to the pool?

591
01:08:43,053 --> 01:08:45,055
Yes, he'd like that.

592
01:08:45,155 --> 01:08:46,862
He keeps asking about you.

593
01:08:46,957 --> 01:08:48,265
- He does?
-Yeah.

594
01:08:55,099 --> 01:08:56,203
That's cold!

595
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:58,177
It's cold?

596
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:14,620
Hi.

597
01:09:14,718 --> 01:09:16,197
Hello.

598
01:09:18,122 --> 01:09:20,966
Want to come swimming with me?

599
01:09:21,058 --> 01:09:23,732
Actually, I'm not alone.

600
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:26,433
Too bad.

601
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:28,840
Know Fallen Stone Bay?

602
01:09:30,467 --> 01:09:33,846
I'll be there,
if you change your mind.

603
01:09:33,937 --> 01:09:35,473
All right.

604
01:09:43,313 --> 01:09:45,054
Who was it?

605
01:09:48,118 --> 01:09:49,620
The woman next door.

606
01:10:09,072 --> 01:10:11,143
What would you do
to hurt someone?

607
01:10:11,241 --> 01:10:13,016
What do you mean?

608
01:10:13,110 --> 01:10:15,647
If you had to,
what would you do?

609
01:10:15,746 --> 01:10:17,521
I don't understand.

610
01:10:19,950 --> 01:10:22,794
If you had to
hurt your brother,

611
01:10:22,886 --> 01:10:24,661
what would you do?

612
01:10:24,755 --> 01:10:27,292
I'd never hurt him.
What is this?

613
01:10:28,759 --> 01:10:31,638
You never Wanted
to hurt someone you love?

614
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:32,638
No.

615
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:34,265
Never crossed your mind?

616
01:10:34,364 --> 01:10:36,435
No, I don't think so.

617
01:10:37,968 --> 01:10:40,209
That's your problem.

618
01:10:40,304 --> 01:10:41,806
My problem?

619
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:44,408
You're naive.

620
01:10:44,508 --> 01:10:47,079
It's naive
not to want to hurt others?

621
01:10:50,013 --> 01:10:53,119
Funny how you
want to be perfect.

622
01:10:53,217 --> 01:10:54,696
You think you're pure

623
01:10:54,785 --> 01:10:56,458
and beyond reproach,

624
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:00,860
but you're just naive

625
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:20,388
Where's Gaspard going?

626
01:11:20,477 --> 01:11:22,320
You're hurting me!

627
01:11:22,412 --> 01:11:23,447
I'm sorry.

628
01:12:28,178 --> 01:12:30,454
You came in the end.

629
01:12:32,683 --> 01:12:34,720
You're not going in?

630
01:12:41,591 --> 01:12:42,865
Where's Marion?

631
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,940
Looking after her brother.

632
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:12,633
Come on, no one's here.

633
01:17:28,345 --> 01:17:30,791
What a bastard!

634
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:33,156
He's something else.

635
01:19:31,334 --> 01:19:33,007
What the hell?

636
01:20:36,266 --> 01:20:38,906
She looks so peaceful,
doesn't she?

637
01:20:39,002 --> 01:20:40,675
Get out of here.

638
01:20:42,806 --> 01:20:44,183
Did you hear me?

639
01:20:44,274 --> 01:20:45,844
Get out.

640
01:20:45,942 --> 01:20:47,387
So?

641
01:20:47,477 --> 01:20:49,753
Did you sleep with her?

642
01:20:49,846 --> 01:20:51,450
What?

643
01:20:51,548 --> 01:20:54,927
You can tell me.
Audrey said she wanted to.

644
01:20:57,353 --> 01:20:58,764
Was it good?

645
01:20:58,855 --> 01:21:00,300
None of your business.

646
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:02,267
It is my business.

647
01:21:04,327 --> 01:21:06,705
I don't want you to hurt her.

648
01:21:06,796 --> 01:21:09,640
I won't

649
01:21:09,732 --> 01:21:12,269
That's true.
You're a good kid.

650
01:21:12,368 --> 01:21:14,712
The savior.

651
01:21:14,804 --> 01:21:16,977
She needs help.

652
01:21:17,073 --> 01:21:19,178
You want to help her?

653
01:21:19,275 --> 01:21:20,686
To do what?

654
01:21:25,715 --> 01:21:30,960
Two years ago, I realized
she was online more and more.

655
01:21:31,054 --> 01:21:34,968
She'd chat to nutters
who wanted to waste themselves.

656
01:21:36,493 --> 01:21:40,202
When I found out,
I chatted to them too.

657
01:21:40,296 --> 01:21:43,402
One day,
I was online with a guy

658
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,639
and I told him he was right.

659
01:21:45,735 --> 01:21:48,045
It didnt make sense
for him to go on.

660
01:21:48,137 --> 01:21:52,586
He didn't deserve to live.
He should die.

661
01:21:52,675 --> 01:21:55,815
I thought he'd tell me
to fuck off,

662
01:21:55,912 --> 01:21:58,415
but instead, he started crying.

663
01:21:58,515 --> 01:22:00,927
And he thanked me.

664
01:22:01,017 --> 01:22:04,726
We chatted, and I told him
to jump under a train,

665
01:22:04,821 --> 01:22:06,596
at a tunnel near his place.

666
01:22:08,391 --> 01:22:10,837
I gave him the date and time.

667
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:13,736
You killed him.

668
01:22:15,665 --> 01:22:18,509
He killed himself.

669
01:22:18,601 --> 01:22:22,208
You've no idea
how many guys want to die.

670
01:22:22,305 --> 01:22:26,151
Most can't manage it
but they're obsessed by it.

671
01:22:26,242 --> 01:22:28,916
Know what they want?

672
01:22:29,012 --> 01:22:32,050
Someone to help them.

673
01:22:32,148 --> 01:22:36,119
Someone to give them
the little push they heed.

674
01:22:36,219 --> 01:22:38,096
That's what they want.

675
01:22:38,187 --> 01:22:40,599
A little push.

676
01:22:40,690 --> 01:22:43,899
Not just losers or depressives.

677
01:22:45,995 --> 01:22:48,202
Some of them seem to be fine.

678
01:22:56,172 --> 01:22:58,778
- What?
- Someone's there.

679
01:23:48,524 --> 01:23:52,062
Sam, we need to talk!

680
01:23:58,701 --> 01:24:00,180
What's wrong?

681
01:24:00,269 --> 01:24:02,749
- Your brother was at my place.
- My brother?

682
01:24:02,839 --> 01:24:04,614
Yes, your brother.
Vincent.

683
01:24:04,707 --> 01:24:05,777
How do you know him?

684
01:24:05,875 --> 01:24:08,685
I'm Gaspard.

685
01:24:08,778 --> 01:24:11,418
Silly me.
I should have known.

686
01:24:11,514 --> 01:24:14,154
He was at the quarry
when you were with Dragon.

687
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:17,288
He was in the bushes watching.

688
01:24:17,387 --> 01:24:18,491
Did you know?

689
01:24:18,588 --> 01:24:20,397
Yes.

690
01:24:20,490 --> 01:24:22,299
Tell me What's going on.

691
01:24:22,392 --> 01:24:23,427
I can't.

692
01:24:23,526 --> 01:24:25,437
Is he making you do it?

693
01:24:28,765 --> 01:24:30,335
He made you use the camera?

694
01:24:30,433 --> 01:24:33,346
No, it was my idea.
As a souvenir for him.

695
01:24:33,436 --> 01:24:36,417
No, he said he makes people
commit suicide.

696
01:24:36,506 --> 01:24:38,679
It turns him on seeing them die.

697
01:24:38,775 --> 01:24:40,686
Go to the police, Audrey.

698
01:24:40,777 --> 01:24:41,881
No, I can't.

699
01:24:41,978 --> 01:24:43,423
You have to.

700
01:24:43,513 --> 01:24:44,617
I can't!

701
01:24:44,714 --> 01:24:46,625
Why not?

702
01:24:46,716 --> 01:24:49,253
Because...
I'm his slave.

703
01:24:49,352 --> 01:24:51,798
What are you saying?

704
01:24:51,888 --> 01:24:55,062
Without him, I'm lost.
He loves me so much.

705
01:24:55,158 --> 01:24:56,262
That's not true.

706
01:24:56,359 --> 01:24:58,965
You don't need him.

707
01:24:59,062 --> 01:25:01,668
He manipulates you. He's toxic.
He hurts you.

708
01:25:01,764 --> 01:25:04,142
Go to the police, or I will.

709
01:25:04,233 --> 01:25:06,509
It's true, he is mad.

710
01:25:06,602 --> 01:25:08,047
He's driving me mad.

711
01:25:08,137 --> 01:25:09,912
I'm ending all this.

712
01:25:10,006 --> 01:25:11,883
I'll waste myself.
For good.

713
01:25:11,974 --> 01:25:14,511
No, we can talk,
see each other.

714
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:16,749
- it's no use.
- It is.

715
01:25:16,846 --> 01:25:20,487
I Want to see you,
see you face to face for real.

716
01:25:20,583 --> 01:25:22,324
Okay?

717
01:25:23,986 --> 01:25:26,023
Audrey, say you agree.

718
01:25:29,926 --> 01:25:30,870
Okay.

719
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,837
Can you come into town?

720
01:25:32,929 --> 01:25:34,840
Why not come here?

721
01:25:34,931 --> 01:25:36,672
To your place?

722
01:25:36,766 --> 01:25:38,473
I want to avoid him.

723
01:25:38,568 --> 01:25:41,048
Vincent?
He isn't here.

724
01:25:41,137 --> 01:25:42,081
Where is he?

725
01:25:42,171 --> 01:25:44,481
In Nice with Samos and his gang.

726
01:25:44,574 --> 01:25:45,644
What if he comes back?

727
01:25:45,742 --> 01:25:47,688
He's spending the night there.

728
01:25:51,247 --> 01:25:54,558
Are you afraid?

729
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:56,857
I understand.
Forget it.

730
01:25:56,953 --> 01:26:00,366
No, wait. I'll come.

731
01:26:00,456 --> 01:26:01,696
You will?

732
01:26:02,925 --> 01:26:05,269
I'll be waiting.

733
01:26:08,731 --> 01:26:10,438
Kiss me, Gordon.

734
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:36,192
Come on.

735
01:26:36,292 --> 01:26:38,533
Make yourself beautiful.

736
01:26:38,628 --> 01:26:39,971
Found someone?

737
01:26:40,062 --> 01:26:42,064
Yeah.

738
01:26:43,065 --> 01:26:44,772
What's his name?

739
01:26:44,867 --> 01:26:46,346
Gordon.

740
01:26:48,037 --> 01:26:49,107
Gordon?

741
01:26:49,205 --> 01:26:51,412
You like him?

742
01:26:51,507 --> 01:26:53,578
Yes.

743
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,879
Hi.

744
01:28:26,969 --> 01:28:28,915
I saw Marion.

745
01:28:29,005 --> 01:28:31,076
She's in a bad way.

746
01:28:31,173 --> 01:28:34,052
She's worried for you.

747
01:28:34,143 --> 01:28:36,919
She says you've changed.

748
01:28:38,381 --> 01:28:39,689
You're not with Lucio?

749
01:28:39,782 --> 01:28:43,355
No, Ludo's on a loop
about his sexual exploits.

750
01:28:43,452 --> 01:28:46,899
Talk about young,
dumb, and full of cum.

751
01:28:46,989 --> 01:28:49,230
He's a pain in the ass.

752
01:28:56,899 --> 01:28:59,470
What's happening to us?

753
01:29:00,937 --> 01:29:03,417
The four of us got on so well.

754
01:29:04,941 --> 01:29:06,318
What went wrong?

755
01:29:06,409 --> 01:29:07,854
I don't know.

756
01:29:12,048 --> 01:29:14,221
You should see Marion.

757
01:29:14,317 --> 01:29:15,352
Too late.

758
01:29:15,451 --> 01:29:17,522
- Why?
- Audrey needs me.

759
01:29:17,620 --> 01:29:19,463
Audrey?
That's bullshit.

760
01:29:19,555 --> 01:29:20,761
You can't understand.

761
01:29:20,856 --> 01:29:23,097
Marion's a thousand times
better!

762
01:29:25,094 --> 01:29:26,869
I have to go.

763
01:29:26,963 --> 01:29:28,306
Give me my scooter keys.

764
01:29:28,397 --> 01:29:29,671
Now?

765
01:29:29,765 --> 01:29:30,869
Yes. Now.

766
01:31:41,530 --> 01:31:42,531
No!

767
01:31:42,631 --> 01:31:45,168
Leave it on.

768
01:31:47,670 --> 01:31:49,377
Hold me in your arms.

769
01:31:54,343 --> 01:31:56,914
Hold me tight.

770
01:31:57,012 --> 01:31:58,753
Tighten

771
01:31:59,815 --> 01:32:01,522
Tighten

772
01:32:11,994 --> 01:32:13,337
Audrey...

773
01:32:20,903 --> 01:32:22,905
You?

774
01:32:26,142 --> 01:32:27,450
What's wrong?

775
01:32:27,543 --> 01:32:29,682
Nothing.

776
01:33:00,976 --> 01:33:03,286
I don't want you to die...

777
01:33:04,847 --> 01:33:06,520
I don't want you to die.

778
01:33:39,515 --> 01:33:42,155
The savior wanted to screw her?

779
01:33:47,223 --> 01:33:49,032
Why did you come?

780
01:33:50,526 --> 01:33:53,200
It wasn't to save her.
That's bullshit.

781
01:33:56,565 --> 01:33:58,772
Know why you're here?

782
01:33:58,867 --> 01:34:00,938
I'll tell you.

783
01:34:01,036 --> 01:34:04,108
You're like the others.

784
01:34:04,206 --> 01:34:06,743
You want to die with her.

785
01:34:41,777 --> 01:34:42,881
Get up.

786
01:34:48,517 --> 01:34:49,928
Open the door.

787
01:34:54,490 --> 01:34:56,299
Open the door!

788
01:35:01,530 --> 01:35:03,305
Audrey!

789
01:35:17,980 --> 01:35:19,084
Stop!

790
01:35:22,384 --> 01:35:23,988
Stop!

791
01:35:26,955 --> 01:35:28,992
Vincent!

792
01:35:37,733 --> 01:35:39,770
I'm going away, Vincent.

793
01:35:39,868 --> 01:35:41,006
Get down.

794
01:35:48,544 --> 01:35:50,421
Stay right there.

795
01:35:52,348 --> 01:35:54,328
Don't be a fool.
Get down.

796
01:35:54,416 --> 01:35:56,327
No.

797
01:35:56,418 --> 01:35:57,795
I'm sick of it.

798
01:35:59,321 --> 01:36:01,028
Come on.

799
01:36:02,624 --> 01:36:03,796
No.

800
01:36:04,993 --> 01:36:07,496
I'm going to the Black Beach.
For good.

801
01:36:07,596 --> 01:36:10,475
Don't talk crap.
The Black Beach doesn't exist.

802
01:36:10,566 --> 01:36:12,568
Yes, it does.

803
01:37:06,422 --> 01:37:09,232
Marion...

804
01:37:10,959 --> 01:37:13,132
You have to get up.

805
01:37:13,228 --> 01:37:16,038
Your friend Gaspard
is in trouble.

806
01:37:19,835 --> 01:37:22,042
I'll wait downstairs.

807
01:38:14,723 --> 01:38:15,861
Where are you going?

808
01:38:15,958 --> 01:38:17,733
Stay here.

809
01:39:29,164 --> 01:39:31,144
Marion...

810
01:39:49,451 --> 01:39:52,591
I wasn't lying at the quarry
when I said I loved you.

811
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:08,147
Maybe I ruined everything,
but I wasn't lying.

812
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:11,883
This is the place.

813
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:37,685
About...

814
00:39:24,129 --> 00:39:26,234
We can't listen to music now?

815
01:29:19,555 --> 01:29:21,796
Marion's a thousand times
better!
