The past several months... [Beeping]

J.R. has been working

And that meant taking
down Cliff Barnes for good.

Unfortunately... [Latches open]

Cliff got to Mexico before
J.R. could finish his plan.

207

That's my father's gun.

That's the gun that killed my brother.

J.R. caught wind that
Cliff had followed him

down to Nuevo Laredo.

His sixth sense made him
worried, so he called me.

By the time I got to the hotel Colón,

213
00:13:16,847 --> 00:13:18,756
J.R. was already dying.

214
00:13:19,762 --> 00:13:22,754
He told me that Cliff was
using the Mendez-Ochoa cartel

215

to cover his tracks

216

and to call Carlos Del Sol.

217
00:13:26,645 --> 00:13:28,266
Carlos bought the gun

218
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:31,400
that Cliff used to kill
J.R. from the cartel.

Why didn't you tell us all this before?

it on some random mugger

if you knew it was Cliff and
you had the gun to prove it?

222
00:13:37,368 --> 00:13:39,026
Because J.R. wanted Cliff to think

223
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:40,578
he had gotten away with it...
