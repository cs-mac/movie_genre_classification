1
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:06,818
What am I working on?

2
00:02:07,435 --> 00:02:10,025
Something that will
change the world...

3
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:11,981
...and human life as we know it.

4
00:02:12,348 --> 00:02:15,898
Change it a lot or just a bit?
Be more specific.

5
00:02:16,472 --> 00:02:19,062
You want me to be more
specific here with...

6
00:02:19,268 --> 00:02:22,688
...half the scientific
community eavesdropping?

7
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:24,433
Where else?

8
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:29,099
You could come back to my lab.

9
00:02:30,053 --> 00:02:31,633
I'll make cappuccino.

10
00:02:31,841 --> 00:02:33,971
I have a Faema of my own.

11
00:02:34,177 --> 00:02:36,927
It's not the dilettante's
plastic model.

12
00:02:37,213 --> 00:02:41,473
It's a restaurant espresso machine
with an eagle on top.

13
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:45,046
Somehow I get the feeling
you don't get out much.

14
00:02:45,382 --> 00:02:48,592
-You can tell that?
-Yes.

15
00:02:58,584 --> 00:03:01,794
You're making a mistake.
I think you really want to talk to me.

16
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:04,999
Sorry. I have three other interviews
before this party is over.

17
00:03:05,244 --> 00:03:07,874
But they don't have something
that will change the world.

18
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,450
They say they do.

19
00:03:10,827 --> 00:03:12,417
Yeah but they're lying.

20
00:03:12,914 --> 00:03:14,034
I'm not.

21
00:03:20,244 --> 00:03:21,454
Are you sick?

22
00:03:22,111 --> 00:03:24,831
No-- Sure.

23
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:27,616
You're not a very good drunk.

24
00:03:28,692 --> 00:03:30,952
No, I'm always like this.
It's the...

25
00:03:31,698 --> 00:03:36,618
...motion sickness. When I was a kid,
I puked on my tricycle.

26
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:39,779
I hate vehicles.

27
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,566
Should I drive slowly?

28
00:03:41,814 --> 00:03:44,364
No. Turn left.
We're almost there.

29
00:04:01,936 --> 00:04:02,976
This is it?

30
00:04:03,304 --> 00:04:06,774
It's cleaner on the inside.

31
00:04:16,426 --> 00:04:17,716
Please.

32
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:51,291
Listen.
Maybe this is a bad idea.

33
00:04:52,495 --> 00:04:54,125
Too late.

34
00:04:54,702 --> 00:04:58,332
You've already seen them.
You can't leave here alive.

35
00:05:01,373 --> 00:05:02,623
I haven't seen anything.

36
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:05,369
Those.

37
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,370
Designer phone booths.

38
00:05:13,576 --> 00:05:15,576
Very cute.

39
00:05:16,612 --> 00:05:19,822
I bet you have a really neat
jukebox in here too.

40
00:05:20,107 --> 00:05:21,407
Over there?

41
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:23,364
No.

42
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:27,949
No.
This is the...

43
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:33,025
...prototype of those.
The first one I had made.

44
00:05:33,648 --> 00:05:37,648
It works, but it's clunky.

45
00:05:50,185 --> 00:05:51,975
I call them telepods.

46
00:05:53,011 --> 00:05:54,721
They're controlled by this.

47
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,348
Thank God for that.

48
00:05:58,843 --> 00:06:01,933
What do these
phones booths do?

49
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:03,179
Telepods.

50
00:06:07,841 --> 00:06:11,181
Okay, I need an object.

51
00:06:13,463 --> 00:06:15,923
Do you have something that is...

52
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:19,719
...personal I can use?
Something uniquely you?

53
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,093
An item of clothing or jewelry?

54
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,250
You kidding?

55
00:06:24,548 --> 00:06:25,878
No, I'm serious.

56
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,291
Okay. Here it goes.

57
00:06:51,241 --> 00:06:53,081
I don't wear jewelry.

58
00:07:00,278 --> 00:07:02,028
It's nice.

59
00:07:15,237 --> 00:07:17,487
Brundle, Seth.

60
00:07:36,847 --> 00:07:38,267
Watch the stocking.

61
00:08:07,964 --> 00:08:08,964
Well?

62
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:11,591
Great.

63
00:08:12,088 --> 00:08:16,048
A giant microwave oven. I'm glad
I didn't give you my Rolex.

64
00:08:16,253 --> 00:08:17,503
If I had a Rolex.

65
00:08:17,711 --> 00:08:19,881
You're missing the point.
Look.

66
00:08:27,827 --> 00:08:29,247
Teleportation?

67
00:08:31,082 --> 00:08:32,582
Please.

68
00:08:48,408 --> 00:08:50,028
Wait a minute.

69
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:52,864
Is that a hologram?

70
00:08:53,401 --> 00:08:56,741
-Where's my stocking?
-That's it.

71
00:08:57,945 --> 00:08:58,905
Pick it up.

72
00:09:11,776 --> 00:09:13,776
I don't get it.

73
00:09:14,642 --> 00:09:15,772
What happened?

74
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,520
You get it but you can't handle it.

75
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:23,684
Your stocking has just
been teleported...

76
00:09:24,058 --> 00:09:27,398
...from one pod to another.

77
00:09:27,604 --> 00:09:30,474
Disintegrated there
and reintegrated there.

78
00:09:31,219 --> 00:09:32,309
Sort of.

79
00:09:33,475 --> 00:09:36,055
It will change the world
as we know it, right?

80
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:46,929
This is incredible.

81
00:09:47,136 --> 00:09:48,926
It's not possible, is it?

82
00:09:49,383 --> 00:09:51,173
How have you kept this quiet?

83
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,380
Please sit down.

84
00:09:53,797 --> 00:09:55,887
How could you do this alone?

85
00:09:56,543 --> 00:09:58,293
I don't work alone.

86
00:09:58,501 --> 00:10:01,011
There's stuff in there I don't
understand. I'm really a...

87
00:10:01,207 --> 00:10:02,917
...systems manager.
I farm out...

88
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:06,254
...pieces to men more
brilliant than I. I say:

89
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:11,340
"Design me a molecular analyzer, "
and they do. I just assemble it.

90
00:10:11,582 --> 00:10:14,292
None of them knows
what the project really is.

91
00:10:17,744 --> 00:10:21,254
And the money? Bartok
Science Industries financed this?

92
00:10:21,868 --> 00:10:24,748
But they leave me alone
because I'm not expensive.

93
00:10:25,164 --> 00:10:28,084
They know they'll own
whatever it is.

94
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,829
You haven't told them?

95
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:31,117
When I'm ready.

96
00:10:32,653 --> 00:10:34,163
Wait a second.

97
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:37,238
What's that?

98
00:10:38,575 --> 00:10:40,035
To get the quotes right.

99
00:10:40,402 --> 00:10:42,742
Quotes? No.

100
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:45,199
This was personal.
Don't write about it.

101
00:10:46,524 --> 00:10:48,984
What do you mean?
I'm a journalist.

102
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,070
-Oh, no.
-You knew that.

103
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:57,275
I made a mistake. I shouldn't
have shown you this. I'm very sorry.

104
00:10:57,479 --> 00:11:02,359
Particle Magazine sent me
to get a story.

105
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:04,942
This is the most
exciting story ever.

106
00:11:05,148 --> 00:11:07,688
No. Absolutely not.
I must have that tape.

107
00:11:07,894 --> 00:11:09,394
-Please.
-You can't do that.

108
00:11:09,642 --> 00:11:10,932
Don't write a story.

109
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,060
I'd never have told
this stuff to a journalist.

110
00:11:13,267 --> 00:11:16,857
-But you told it to me.
-I suppose I did but--

111
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:18,971
-Sure did.
-Now wait a minute.

112
00:11:20,057 --> 00:11:22,347
Come here.
What about your stocking?

113
00:11:22,764 --> 00:11:24,724
Keep it for good luck.

114
00:11:35,756 --> 00:11:39,346
I say: "Design me a
molecular analyzer, " and they do.

115
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,630
I just assemble it.

116
00:11:41,008 --> 00:11:43,088
None of them knows
what the project really is.

117
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:48,751
And the money? Bartok
Science Industries financed this?

118
00:11:49,007 --> 00:11:52,007
But they leave me alone
because I'm not expensive.

119
00:11:52,922 --> 00:11:55,422
They know they'll own
whatever it is.

120
00:11:56,786 --> 00:11:59,046
Well, that's it.

121
00:12:00,621 --> 00:12:01,711
What do you think?

122
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:03,619
It's a joke.

123
00:12:03,827 --> 00:12:04,667
What?

124
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,455
He's conning you.

125
00:12:06,703 --> 00:12:09,163
It's an old nightclub routine.
The two cabinets.

126
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:12,669
-You fell for it.
-Wait a minute.

127
00:12:12,864 --> 00:12:14,704
-That was no--
-Are we having lunch?

128
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:18,541
That was no nightclub routine.
I was there. I saw it.

129
00:12:24,528 --> 00:12:25,778
Sure.

130
00:12:26,365 --> 00:12:27,865
Send him in.

131
00:12:29,152 --> 00:12:31,492
You must have made an impression.

132
00:12:31,858 --> 00:12:32,908
What do you mean?

133
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:36,116
Your magician followed you here.

134
00:12:38,938 --> 00:12:41,948
I'm Stathis Borans,
editor of Particle Magazine.

135
00:12:42,153 --> 00:12:45,193
-Seth Brundle.
-I know who you are.

136
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:49,937
Why don't you two use my office?
I've gotta run.

137
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,522
If you plan to make anything
disappear, let me know.

138
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:57,277
I have an assistant editor
who's outlived his usefulness.

139
00:13:02,226 --> 00:13:03,516
You didn't waste time.

140
00:13:04,393 --> 00:13:06,433
I'm not getting any younger.

141
00:13:08,886 --> 00:13:11,136
He wasn't impressed by your tape?

142
00:13:12,761 --> 00:13:14,301
He thinks you're a con man.

143
00:13:17,514 --> 00:13:18,464
Excellent.

144
00:13:19,552 --> 00:13:21,722
Let's see what the people
at Omni think about it.

145
00:13:21,928 --> 00:13:24,218
No, no.
Listen, Veronica....

146
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:28,722
I've come here to say one magic word.

147
00:13:30,047 --> 00:13:30,927
Yeah?

148
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:32,924
Cheeseburger.

149
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,585
I've been working alone too long.

150
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,630
I have a strong urge
to talk about what I'm doing.

151
00:13:46,624 --> 00:13:49,414
But if this gets out now...

152
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,620
...Veronica, it'll kill me.

153
00:13:52,286 --> 00:13:54,996
The Bartok people
and my colleagues will kill me.

154
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:57,291
It's not ready yet.

155
00:13:57,539 --> 00:13:58,959
It works okay.

156
00:13:59,286 --> 00:14:01,536
No, something important's missing.

157
00:14:01,953 --> 00:14:02,953
Yeah?

158
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,330
Yeah.

159
00:14:07,365 --> 00:14:08,325
What?

160
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,740
I can only teleport inanimate objects.

161
00:14:16,612 --> 00:14:18,862
What happens when you
teleport living things?

162
00:14:20,607 --> 00:14:21,697
Not while we're eating.

163
00:14:22,484 --> 00:14:24,524
Can't be worse than this.

164
00:14:27,987 --> 00:14:30,657
You're not doing
a good job of convincing me.

165
00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:34,523
I think I should tell
the world about this now.

166
00:14:35,147 --> 00:14:36,817
You should tell it...

167
00:14:38,851 --> 00:14:41,351
...but not yet.
What do you have so far?

168
00:14:42,187 --> 00:14:43,687
Enough to make you nervous.

169
00:14:43,894 --> 00:14:47,394
Why not get more? Make me
your major project, a book.

170
00:14:47,599 --> 00:14:49,559
Not a magazine article.

171
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:53,056
Follow me and my work,
day by day in detail.

172
00:14:53,721 --> 00:14:57,771
I have no life, so there's nothing
for you to interfere with.

173
00:14:57,975 --> 00:15:01,685
Research the background.
Cover the process.

174
00:15:02,888 --> 00:15:06,178
"The complete record of the most
earth-shattering invention ever.

175
00:15:06,423 --> 00:15:09,883
The one that ended
all concepts of transport...

176
00:15:10,088 --> 00:15:13,048
...of borders and frontiers,
of time and space."

177
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,420
The book will end with me...

178
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:22,096
...transporting myself
from one telepod to another.

179
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:23,591
That's what's missing.

180
00:15:26,795 --> 00:15:28,215
Wait for me that long?

181
00:16:15,857 --> 00:16:17,857
What are you doing here?

182
00:16:18,273 --> 00:16:21,153
I was in the neighborhood.
Felt a bit scummy.

183
00:16:23,227 --> 00:16:24,687
Rough day.

184
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,890
How'd you get in?

185
00:16:38,386 --> 00:16:40,356
I have a key, remember?

186
00:16:40,762 --> 00:16:41,932
You gave it to me.

187
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,930
I should've changed the lock.

188
00:16:45,346 --> 00:16:46,306
You didn't.

189
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:53,929
That's because unconsciously...

190
00:16:55,672 --> 00:16:58,972
...you still want me to come back,
move in again.

191
00:16:59,257 --> 00:17:00,387
No.

192
00:17:01,094 --> 00:17:05,594
That's because, consciously,
I'm lazy and disorganized.

193
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,750
Your new playmate's interesting.

194
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,338
What playmate?

195
00:17:14,705 --> 00:17:16,415
The nightclub act.

196
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,540
Brundle.

197
00:17:20,837 --> 00:17:22,997
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

198
00:17:24,661 --> 00:17:28,211
I was wrong.
He's really quite brilliant.

199
00:17:29,874 --> 00:17:33,624
He led the F32 team.
Remember that?

200
00:17:34,867 --> 00:17:37,957
An inch away from the
Nobel Prize for physics.

201
00:17:38,452 --> 00:17:40,742
He was only 20 at the time.

202
00:17:41,368 --> 00:17:45,288
I'm not going to do Brundle.
Maybe the Psychology Today gig.

203
00:17:45,902 --> 00:17:47,072
That's not like you.

204
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:51,118
Are you getting out or am I?

205
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:56,452
I'll go. Shall I return later
and tuck you in?

206
00:17:57,066 --> 00:17:58,986
No. Key.

207
00:18:01,021 --> 00:18:02,611
I'll keep it...

208
00:18:03,607 --> 00:18:04,987
...for old time's sake.

209
00:18:07,232 --> 00:18:09,442
You're a petty schmuck.

210
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,930
Initiate in 5 seconds.

211
00:19:53,105 --> 00:19:55,445
I've got to do this, Seth.

212
00:19:55,692 --> 00:19:57,612
Talk to the tape.
Get in the habit.

213
00:19:57,938 --> 00:19:59,728
The world will want to know
what you're thinking.

214
00:19:59,936 --> 00:20:01,896
"Fuck" is what I'm thinking!

215
00:20:02,392 --> 00:20:03,602
Good.

216
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,310
The world will want to know that.

217
00:20:07,765 --> 00:20:09,935
What else?
Why didn't it work?

218
00:20:10,681 --> 00:20:13,941
I think it turned the baboon
inside out.

219
00:20:17,222 --> 00:20:18,312
Why?

220
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:23,978
It can't deal with the flesh,
only inanimate objects.

221
00:20:26,848 --> 00:20:28,428
It must be my fault.

222
00:20:29,345 --> 00:20:30,305
Why?

223
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,760
Computers only know
what you tell them.

224
00:20:37,344 --> 00:20:40,844
I don't know enough about the flesh.
I have to learn.

225
00:20:45,463 --> 00:20:47,713
I don't want to talk now.

226
00:21:07,082 --> 00:21:09,162
Do you ever change your clothes?

227
00:21:10,578 --> 00:21:12,038
What?

228
00:21:12,825 --> 00:21:15,825
You're always wearing
the same clothes.

229
00:21:19,156 --> 00:21:23,536
No, these are clean.
I change my clothes every day.

230
00:21:32,817 --> 00:21:35,237
Five sets of exactly the same clothes?

231
00:21:35,863 --> 00:21:36,943
Learned it from Einstein.

232
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:39,939
This way I don't have to...

233
00:21:40,147 --> 00:21:44,527
...expend any thought on what to wear.
I grab the next set on the rack.

234
00:21:51,181 --> 00:21:55,021
I bought some steaks.
Can I make you one?

235
00:21:56,104 --> 00:21:57,264
We could go out.

236
00:21:58,521 --> 00:21:59,681
Cheeseburger?

237
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:06,435
No, we don't have to go there.

238
00:22:15,008 --> 00:22:18,178
You're very cute. You know that?

239
00:22:19,093 --> 00:22:20,173
Am I?

240
00:23:00,205 --> 00:23:01,865
-What happened?
-On my back.

241
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,450
Something's stuck to your back.

242
00:23:06,657 --> 00:23:08,577
Pull it off.

243
00:23:16,822 --> 00:23:18,322
Sorry.

244
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:22,108
I wondered where this was.

245
00:23:22,315 --> 00:23:25,985
-Do you have any disinfectant?
-No, that's okay.

246
00:23:26,189 --> 00:23:27,899
I'll kiss it for you.

247
00:23:36,645 --> 00:23:40,395
Sorry.
I just want to eat you up.

248
00:23:42,017 --> 00:23:45,317
That's why old ladies
pinch babies' cheeks.

249
00:23:45,513 --> 00:23:49,023
It's the flesh. It makes you crazy.

250
00:23:50,935 --> 00:23:52,305
Ronnie. Ronnie.

251
00:23:57,426 --> 00:23:59,686
You want to try an experiment?

252
00:24:00,971 --> 00:24:01,971
Sure.

253
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,868
Eat this.
I need an objective opinion.

254
00:25:05,981 --> 00:25:10,281
It could use some finesse,
but it tastes like a steak.

255
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:19,107
Now try this teleported half.

256
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:23,732
-A monkey just came apart in there.
-Baboon. Eat.

257
00:25:28,689 --> 00:25:29,979
It tastes funny.

258
00:25:30,307 --> 00:25:32,897
-Funny how?
-It tastes...

259
00:25:34,062 --> 00:25:35,022
...synthetic.

260
00:25:39,135 --> 00:25:40,515
What have we proved?

261
00:25:41,302 --> 00:25:46,432
The computer is giving us
its interpretation...

262
00:25:46,924 --> 00:25:50,764
...of a steak. It's translating it,
rethinking it...

263
00:25:50,968 --> 00:25:53,348
...rather than reproducing it.

264
00:25:53,555 --> 00:25:56,555
Something gets lost
in the translation.

265
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,589
Me. I'm lost.

266
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:01,796
The flesh.

267
00:26:02,003 --> 00:26:06,923
It should make the computer crazy.
Like old ladies pinching babies.

268
00:26:07,835 --> 00:26:09,175
But it doesn't yet.

269
00:26:09,383 --> 00:26:13,883
I haven't taught the computer
to be made crazy by the flesh.

270
00:26:14,086 --> 00:26:15,836
The poetry of the steak.

271
00:26:16,543 --> 00:26:18,713
So I'll teach it now.

272
00:27:27,684 --> 00:27:28,764
I knew it.

273
00:27:28,972 --> 00:27:30,472
What are you doing here?

274
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:33,059
I followed you.

275
00:27:33,306 --> 00:27:37,846
Psychology Today, my ass. You
stayed with Brundle all night.

276
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:40,469
Why didn't I believe you?

277
00:27:43,382 --> 00:27:46,182
I think he'd look great in this.
Don't you?

278
00:27:50,213 --> 00:27:53,923
For your Time magazine cover,
you have to look good, right?

279
00:27:54,417 --> 00:27:57,297
Don't you get it?
I am finally onto something big.

280
00:27:57,503 --> 00:28:00,503
-Huge.
-Yeah? What? His cock?

281
00:28:01,547 --> 00:28:03,837
Crude, Stathis. Very crude.

282
00:28:04,044 --> 00:28:05,544
You're too perfect.

283
00:28:07,579 --> 00:28:09,209
You're a goddess.

284
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:11,836
Thanks for making my
paranoid fantasies come true.

285
00:28:12,043 --> 00:28:14,253
I don't have to report to you,
you creep.

286
00:28:14,869 --> 00:28:17,499
Ronnie?
You have to talk to me.

287
00:28:17,705 --> 00:28:19,455
No, I don't! We're finished.

288
00:28:19,662 --> 00:28:22,452
I'll spend the night
anywhere I damn well please.

289
00:28:22,658 --> 00:28:24,868
Sorry. I'll take this too.

290
00:28:59,567 --> 00:29:01,687
I think it's time for champagne.

291
00:29:09,143 --> 00:29:10,563
Oh, God, Seth.

292
00:29:10,771 --> 00:29:12,851
It really happened. You did it!

293
00:29:13,058 --> 00:29:17,148
-You'll never be carsick again.
-Or airsick or seasick.

294
00:29:17,342 --> 00:29:19,722
I know. Or tricycle-sick.

295
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,384
What's next?

296
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,800
Send the baboon out for tests,
see if he's okay.

297
00:29:29,056 --> 00:29:30,096
How long will that take?

298
00:29:31,173 --> 00:29:32,173
Could be weeks.

299
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,260
Really?

300
00:29:34,758 --> 00:29:36,088
Yeah, why?

301
00:29:38,043 --> 00:29:41,633
I was thinking that
we could take a holiday.

302
00:29:42,627 --> 00:29:43,587
We could?

303
00:29:43,965 --> 00:29:46,085
Yeah.
Like an old married couple.

304
00:29:46,292 --> 00:29:49,212
Old man's got
a couple weeks off, so...

305
00:29:49,417 --> 00:29:51,797
...they go to Florida, someplace warm.

306
00:29:52,663 --> 00:29:53,713
Just you and me?

307
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,250
Is there someone else
you want to bring along?

308
00:29:57,456 --> 00:29:59,796
No, no, I just....

309
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:03,211
Is this a romance we're having?

310
00:30:04,996 --> 00:30:07,336
Yeah. Could be a romance.

311
00:30:08,531 --> 00:30:09,701
Come here.

312
00:30:15,361 --> 00:30:17,281
I have a great idea.

313
00:30:22,701 --> 00:30:24,031
You like Chinese food?

314
00:30:24,988 --> 00:30:26,238
Yes.

315
00:30:28,114 --> 00:30:30,234
We'll have a romantic dinner here.

316
00:30:36,772 --> 00:30:37,732
What's this?

317
00:30:38,729 --> 00:30:41,239
From your editor.
It was under the door.

318
00:30:42,024 --> 00:30:44,154
Victor, it's Seth Brundle.

319
00:30:46,268 --> 00:30:47,318
Yeah, I'll wait.

320
00:30:51,271 --> 00:30:52,561
What's that?

321
00:30:56,474 --> 00:31:00,354
Nothing.
It's just personal bullshit.

322
00:31:01,348 --> 00:31:05,608
Old married couples share everything
to stay old and married.

323
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,310
Listen, Seth, don't rush it.

324
00:31:11,384 --> 00:31:13,894
I have to go out for a few hours.

325
00:31:14,719 --> 00:31:17,849
No, Ronnie,
spicy eggplant, champagne.

326
00:31:18,054 --> 00:31:19,464
Just a few hours.

327
00:31:19,672 --> 00:31:21,592
I have the residue of another life.

328
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:25,799
I have to scrape it off my shoe
and get rid of it, once and for all.

329
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:52,459
What's this supposed to mean?

330
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:55,916
I'm your editor and I'm shaping
your material into a story.

331
00:31:56,161 --> 00:31:59,791
You told me there was no story.
You said Brundle was a con man.

332
00:32:00,535 --> 00:32:03,495
I've decided to trust
your journalistic instincts.

333
00:32:03,701 --> 00:32:06,621
Thanks very much.
But this is not your story.

334
00:32:06,827 --> 00:32:08,327
It's mine.

335
00:32:08,574 --> 00:32:09,824
Says who?

336
00:32:10,072 --> 00:32:13,362
I sent you to the Bartok party
to see what you could find.

337
00:32:13,607 --> 00:32:15,617
Your discovery is my discovery.

338
00:32:16,403 --> 00:32:19,653
I have a lot of background on Brundle.

339
00:32:19,898 --> 00:32:21,858
He's worked on this for six years.

340
00:32:22,105 --> 00:32:24,865
There's material to find
if you dig deep.

341
00:32:25,271 --> 00:32:27,401
-I dug.
-Stathis....

342
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:31,028
All transportation is going
to become obsolete.

343
00:32:31,273 --> 00:32:33,443
And I'm in the middle of it.

344
00:32:33,689 --> 00:32:37,149
-The only inside recorder of the event.
-Okay.

345
00:32:44,055 --> 00:32:48,185
Look, just keep me informed.
All right?

346
00:32:48,768 --> 00:32:50,058
As a friend?

347
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:53,185
As a professional confidante?

348
00:32:55,219 --> 00:32:56,509
That's all?

349
00:32:59,633 --> 00:33:02,343
I don't want you
to disappear from my life.

350
00:33:08,801 --> 00:33:10,051
Okay.

351
00:33:13,464 --> 00:33:14,504
What about sex?

352
00:33:15,801 --> 00:33:19,261
I'm not saying love or affection.
Just stress-relieving sex.

353
00:33:19,506 --> 00:33:20,796
You and me.

354
00:33:22,382 --> 00:33:24,132
You're disgusting.

355
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:25,799
As always.

356
00:33:29,751 --> 00:33:31,291
Couldn't disappoint you.

357
00:33:32,917 --> 00:33:35,457
Residue means your old boyfriend,
doesn't it?

358
00:33:37,621 --> 00:33:40,041
Stathis Borans is her old boyfriend.

359
00:33:41,246 --> 00:33:43,786
"From the desk of Stathis Borans."

360
00:33:44,621 --> 00:33:47,081
How about, "Under the desk
of Stathis Borans"?

361
00:33:47,996 --> 00:33:51,826
She works for her old boyfriend
and runs out late at night to see him.

362
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,621
Is this the Ronnie game?

363
00:33:58,032 --> 00:34:00,452
I'm catching on. I'm catching on.

364
00:34:02,945 --> 00:34:06,735
I didn't mean to kill your brother,
but he didn't die in vain...

365
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,780
...if that's any comfort.

366
00:34:10,195 --> 00:34:13,735
I wouldn't ask you to do anything
that I wouldn't do myself.

367
00:34:17,395 --> 00:34:18,525
You're all right.

368
00:34:19,482 --> 00:34:21,402
I can tell you're okay.

369
00:34:25,524 --> 00:34:27,934
What are we waiting for? Let's do it.

370
00:36:06,064 --> 00:36:07,694
How you doing?

371
00:36:08,391 --> 00:36:10,191
Now, you tell me.

372
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:12,688
Am I different somehow?

373
00:36:13,394 --> 00:36:15,604
"Is it live or is it Memorex?"

374
00:36:17,978 --> 00:36:20,188
It's too bad Ronnie missed it.

375
00:37:20,951 --> 00:37:22,871
I missed you last night.

376
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:26,207
It's still night. I came back.

377
00:37:27,242 --> 00:37:30,582
You had to celebrate without me.
I'm sorry.

378
00:37:31,366 --> 00:37:33,286
I went through last night.

379
00:37:34,821 --> 00:37:36,611
You went through?

380
00:37:37,068 --> 00:37:39,318
Without testing the baboon?

381
00:37:40,983 --> 00:37:44,743
I was drunk. I was a bit upset.

382
00:37:45,646 --> 00:37:47,486
You could've killed yourself.

383
00:37:56,731 --> 00:37:58,481
Are you sleeping with Stathis?

384
00:37:59,437 --> 00:38:00,897
What are you talking about?

385
00:38:01,434 --> 00:38:04,734
I don't know.
I just get that feeling.

386
00:38:08,854 --> 00:38:10,394
That's why you were upset?

387
00:38:13,268 --> 00:38:14,928
I got jealous.

388
00:38:15,515 --> 00:38:20,355
Oh, God. Seth, you don't
have to be jealous.

389
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,267
He's an old boyfriend.

390
00:38:23,474 --> 00:38:25,764
He taught college.
I was a science major.

391
00:38:27,089 --> 00:38:29,299
He got me started in journalism.

392
00:38:30,304 --> 00:38:31,384
Does he love you?

393
00:38:32,921 --> 00:38:34,721
How could he not?

394
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:43,050
You went through and I wasn't there.

395
00:38:44,505 --> 00:38:45,925
I taped it for you.

396
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,670
You did?

397
00:43:54,045 --> 00:43:57,555
I asked the computer if it improved
me, but it didn't understand.

398
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:02,050
That made me think about what
I'm feeling and why. I'm thinking...

399
00:44:02,293 --> 00:44:06,883
...that process of being taken apart
atom by atom and reassembled--

400
00:44:07,087 --> 00:44:11,677
It's like filtering coffee. It's a
purifying process. It's cleansed me.

401
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,210
I think it's going to allow me
to realize...

402
00:44:16,044 --> 00:44:19,964
...the personal potential I've been
neglecting all these years...

403
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:23,538
...that I've been obsessively pursuing
goal after goal.

404
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:26,873
Do you take coffee with your sugar?

405
00:44:28,906 --> 00:44:32,206
I've never given me
a chance to be me.

406
00:44:32,781 --> 00:44:35,241
Interestingly, when I achieved...

407
00:44:35,487 --> 00:44:38,037
...what will prove to be my
life's work...

408
00:44:38,283 --> 00:44:40,613
...I've become the real me, finally.

409
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:42,620
So, listen...

410
00:44:42,867 --> 00:44:44,617
...not to wax Messianic...

411
00:44:44,864 --> 00:44:49,704
...but the synchronicity of the two
events may blur the individual effect.

412
00:44:49,947 --> 00:44:53,407
But it is, nevertheless, also
certainly true.

413
00:44:53,652 --> 00:44:57,492
I will say now, however
subjectively, human teleportation...

414
00:44:57,686 --> 00:45:01,236
...molecular breakdown and reformation
is inherently purging.

415
00:45:01,481 --> 00:45:03,441
It makes a man a king.

416
00:45:03,688 --> 00:45:05,398
Since I left the pod, I feel great.

417
00:45:05,645 --> 00:45:08,735
I think I will have a cannoli
after all. Waiter!

418
00:45:08,941 --> 00:45:12,061
What an accomplishment.
But what have I really done?

419
00:45:12,306 --> 00:45:14,186
I've said to the world:

420
00:45:14,433 --> 00:45:17,683
"Let's go. Move.
Catch me if you can." Waiter.

421
00:45:17,938 --> 00:45:19,688
Jesus Christ!

422
00:45:35,963 --> 00:45:37,473
Oh, God.

423
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:41,218
What?

424
00:45:41,925 --> 00:45:44,135
How can you keep going?

425
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,970
You can't have any fluid left
in your body.

426
00:45:49,215 --> 00:45:51,045
We've been doing this for hours.

427
00:45:51,292 --> 00:45:53,302
I'm not ready to quit yet.

428
00:45:55,876 --> 00:45:57,046
Come on.

429
00:46:02,496 --> 00:46:04,416
Hey. What's this?

430
00:46:04,953 --> 00:46:06,663
It's an attempt to distract me.

431
00:46:07,539 --> 00:46:09,669
Really, what is it? It's like...

432
00:46:10,995 --> 00:46:14,335
-...hairs or something.
-I don't know, it's....

433
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:17,160
It happens when you get older,
weird hair.

434
00:46:17,406 --> 00:46:19,326
They're really coarse.

435
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:25,201
I've never been hairy enough.
Know what I mean? Always too boyish.

436
00:46:25,445 --> 00:46:27,455
I look forward to a hairy body.

437
00:46:28,031 --> 00:46:31,411
It's one of the compensations
of old age. Where are you going?

438
00:47:03,771 --> 00:47:06,141
Not my new hairs. What are you doing?

439
00:47:06,348 --> 00:47:07,388
Relax.

440
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:11,355
You don't want a body
covered with these.

441
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,930
God! They're really tough!

442
00:47:17,682 --> 00:47:18,892
Listen.

443
00:47:19,969 --> 00:47:23,309
I want you to go through.
I want to teleport you right now.

444
00:47:23,554 --> 00:47:26,844
I hardly need to sleep
and I feel wonderful.

445
00:47:27,089 --> 00:47:29,089
It's like a pure, benign drug.

446
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,596
The power I feel surging inside me--!

447
00:47:31,803 --> 00:47:34,763
We'll be the perfect couple.
The dynamic duo. Come on.

448
00:47:35,008 --> 00:47:36,428
-Right now.
-Hey, wait.

449
00:47:36,676 --> 00:47:40,046
Don't give me that born-again
teleportation. I'm scared.

450
00:47:40,251 --> 00:47:42,881
What do I have to say?
I'm not gonna do it!

451
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:46,255
You're a fucking drag, you know?

452
00:47:49,538 --> 00:47:53,628
Something went wrong. When you
went through, something went wrong.

453
00:48:00,123 --> 00:48:01,993
No? Not you?

454
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,830
If you're too chickenshit to be
in the dynamic duo club...

455
00:48:06,075 --> 00:48:08,915
...I'll find somebody else
who can keep up with me.

456
00:48:09,161 --> 00:48:10,661
Listen to me--

457
00:48:10,908 --> 00:48:13,368
You're afraid to dive
in the plasma pool.

458
00:48:13,614 --> 00:48:16,204
You're afraid to be destroyed
and re-created.

459
00:48:16,451 --> 00:48:18,491
Think you woke me up about the flesh?

460
00:48:18,737 --> 00:48:21,987
You only know society's
straight line about the flesh.

461
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:26,993
You can't penetrate society's
sick gray fear of the flesh.

462
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:31,985
Drink deep, or taste not the plasma
spring. See what I'm saying?

463
00:48:32,189 --> 00:48:35,319
This is not just sex and penetration,
but penetration...

464
00:48:35,524 --> 00:48:37,614
...beyond the veil of the flesh.

465
00:48:37,811 --> 00:48:41,441
A deep, penetrating dive
into the plasma pool.

466
00:49:24,256 --> 00:49:25,926
I'll have a scotch.

467
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:30,090
Who's winning?

468
00:49:32,125 --> 00:49:33,415
I don't know.

469
00:49:34,622 --> 00:49:36,132
I hope it's Marky.

470
00:49:38,497 --> 00:49:40,627
-How come?
-Because.

471
00:49:41,293 --> 00:49:42,663
I like Marky tonight.

472
00:49:43,909 --> 00:49:44,959
I like you tonight.

473
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:48,416
Maybe I'd better get involved.

474
00:49:51,828 --> 00:49:54,498
Hey, pal, you're disturbing us.

475
00:49:54,744 --> 00:49:56,824
$100 says I can beat either of you.

476
00:50:00,576 --> 00:50:02,156
Take a hike, asshole.

477
00:50:05,988 --> 00:50:07,578
Here's my hundred.

478
00:50:08,735 --> 00:50:10,865
I get to take her home if I win.

479
00:50:11,191 --> 00:50:12,781
Says who?

480
00:50:13,278 --> 00:50:14,488
Do I look like a hooker?

481
00:50:15,316 --> 00:50:18,616
Tawny, it's an easy hundred.
Let's get it over with.

482
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:26,315
-Watch out. He eats chocolate bars.
-So I noticed.

483
00:51:15,252 --> 00:51:17,042
Are you a bodybuilder?

484
00:51:17,299 --> 00:51:21,549
I build bodies. I take them apart
and put them back together.

485
00:51:21,793 --> 00:51:23,923
Well, you sure took Marky apart.

486
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:27,170
-Let's go to my place.
-Your place?

487
00:51:27,415 --> 00:51:30,665
Well, okay.
I live with my mother anyway.

488
00:51:30,871 --> 00:51:34,461
But could we go
to a few more bars first?

489
00:51:34,705 --> 00:51:37,625
-It's too early to quit.
-Sure, a few more bars.

490
00:52:03,196 --> 00:52:05,236
Great place.

491
00:52:13,811 --> 00:52:15,441
There's no elevator.

492
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:18,778
-I can't make it.
-There's an elevator.

493
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:23,980
There, don't you feel elevated?

494
00:53:15,246 --> 00:53:16,746
Are you a magician?

495
00:53:21,747 --> 00:53:23,127
Yes.

496
00:53:50,697 --> 00:53:53,737
So, are we going to breakfast or not?

497
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:57,899
It's your turn.

498
00:53:58,606 --> 00:54:00,606
-To do what?
-To go through.

499
00:54:00,812 --> 00:54:02,982
No. I don't want to try that.

500
00:54:03,229 --> 00:54:04,979
It'll make you feel sexy.

501
00:54:05,226 --> 00:54:07,486
I already feel sexy.

502
00:54:08,851 --> 00:54:10,601
How about...

503
00:54:11,308 --> 00:54:13,108
...a nice...

504
00:54:13,555 --> 00:54:16,855
-...alcohol rub?
-Don't do that! It hurts.

505
00:54:18,768 --> 00:54:20,808
Sorry, hon.

506
00:54:21,344 --> 00:54:24,144
I didn't know you had
the skin of a princess.

507
00:54:25,009 --> 00:54:26,559
-You're sensitive.
-Okay!

508
00:54:26,806 --> 00:54:28,976
That's it. You're going to like it.

509
00:54:29,223 --> 00:54:31,843
-I don't want to. I'm afraid.
-Don't be afraid.

510
00:54:32,099 --> 00:54:33,139
No.

511
00:54:33,887 --> 00:54:36,847
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

512
00:54:37,671 --> 00:54:39,131
Who's this?

513
00:54:40,008 --> 00:54:42,098
Oh, I live with my mother too.

514
00:54:42,754 --> 00:54:44,054
Mom, meet Tawny.

515
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:47,470
I gotta go.

516
00:54:53,499 --> 00:54:55,379
Thanks for a wonderful time.

517
00:55:04,204 --> 00:55:07,334
Why'd you scare her off? Jealous?

518
00:55:09,707 --> 00:55:10,917
You're changing.

519
00:55:11,784 --> 00:55:14,124
Everything about you is changing.

520
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:16,200
You look bad.

521
00:55:16,827 --> 00:55:17,867
You smell bad.

522
00:55:18,914 --> 00:55:20,454
I've never bathed much.

523
00:55:22,948 --> 00:55:27,868
Those weird hairs that grew out
of your back, I took them to a lab.

524
00:55:28,071 --> 00:55:29,951
I had them analyzed.

525
00:55:33,234 --> 00:55:34,944
The hairs?

526
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:38,070
The hairs?

527
00:55:38,487 --> 00:55:41,617
Oh, yeah.
That's a strange thing to do.

528
00:55:41,812 --> 00:55:44,112
Not as strange as the results.

529
00:55:44,568 --> 00:55:47,238
The guy had trouble identifying them.

530
00:55:47,894 --> 00:55:51,694
He finally concluded that they
were definitely not human.

531
00:55:54,185 --> 00:55:56,815
-Very good.
-Not human, Seth.

532
00:55:57,101 --> 00:56:01,151
In fact, very likely insect hairs.

533
00:56:01,805 --> 00:56:03,315
That's ridiculous.

534
00:56:03,562 --> 00:56:04,772
Look.

535
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:07,560
There's more. Look at your face.

536
00:56:08,645 --> 00:56:10,395
Something happened.

537
00:56:10,642 --> 00:56:13,262
You need help. You must be sick.

538
00:56:13,468 --> 00:56:15,138
You're jealous!

539
00:56:18,092 --> 00:56:20,852
I've become free
and you can't stand it.

540
00:56:21,098 --> 00:56:23,258
You'll do anything to bring me down.

541
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:27,802
Does this look like a sick man to you?

542
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,386
No, stop it!

543
00:56:31,633 --> 00:56:33,253
Can a sick man do that?

544
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:36,800
The deal is off.
I don't need you anymore.

545
00:56:38,424 --> 00:56:40,504
Seth, please, wait. Seth!

546
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:41,880
Don't come back.

547
00:56:43,047 --> 00:56:44,707
Oh, God....

548
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,030
Oh, no.

549
00:59:00,986 --> 00:59:03,406
What's happening to me? Am I dying?

550
00:59:05,779 --> 00:59:07,989
Is this how it starts? Am I dying?

551
00:59:11,531 --> 00:59:13,191
Brundle, Seth.

552
00:59:14,397 --> 00:59:16,107
Give me a disc.

553
00:59:17,023 --> 00:59:19,653
I need the first
teleportation: S. Brundle.

554
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,100
Run sequence.

555
01:01:50,341 --> 01:01:51,591
Hello.

556
01:01:55,254 --> 01:01:56,594
Seth.

557
01:01:58,919 --> 01:02:02,839
Seth, I've been trying to reach you.
Where are you?

558
01:02:03,043 --> 01:02:04,963
I've been afraid to see you.

559
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:09,800
Now I'm afraid not to.

560
01:02:10,003 --> 01:02:11,423
Are you at home?

561
01:02:11,581 --> 01:02:13,671
You don't know how right you were.

562
01:02:13,878 --> 01:02:15,538
I've gotten...

563
01:02:15,995 --> 01:02:18,585
...much, much worse.

564
01:02:18,831 --> 01:02:21,161
Please come see me.

565
01:02:21,418 --> 01:02:23,248
Please come now.

566
01:02:47,901 --> 01:02:49,321
Seth?

567
01:02:49,948 --> 01:02:50,988
I'm here.

568
01:02:51,236 --> 01:02:52,406
Stop!

569
01:02:59,145 --> 01:03:00,985
You were right.

570
01:03:01,192 --> 01:03:03,272
I'm diseased...

571
01:03:04,148 --> 01:03:06,568
...and it might be contagious somehow.

572
01:03:07,983 --> 01:03:10,143
I wouldn't want to infect you.

573
01:03:12,437 --> 01:03:14,687
And it's been accelerating.

574
01:03:15,263 --> 01:03:18,893
It's unrelenting.
Every day there are changes.

575
01:03:19,057 --> 01:03:22,597
Every time I look in the mirror,
I'm someone different, repulsive.

576
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:23,802
What happened?

577
01:03:24,051 --> 01:03:28,021
I know an old lady who swallowed a fly
Perhaps she'll de

578
01:03:28,844 --> 01:03:31,554
Seth, please.

579
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:36,809
I was not pure. The teleporter
insists on purity. I was not pure.

580
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,470
I don't know what you mean.

581
01:03:43,294 --> 01:03:45,134
A fly...

582
01:03:45,671 --> 01:03:50,761
...got into the transmitter pod with
me that first time when I was alone.

583
01:03:54,339 --> 01:03:56,959
The computer got confused.

584
01:03:57,165 --> 01:04:00,465
There weren't supposed
to be two genetic patterns.

585
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:04,090
And it decided to splice us together.

586
01:04:04,744 --> 01:04:06,584
It mated us, me and the fly.

587
01:04:06,791 --> 01:04:08,871
We hadn't been properly introduced.

588
01:04:12,783 --> 01:04:16,753
My teleporter turned
into a gene splicer.

589
01:04:17,536 --> 01:04:20,916
A very good one.
I'm not Seth Brundle anymore.

590
01:04:22,370 --> 01:04:25,660
I'm the offspring
of Brundle and a housefly.

591
01:04:27,532 --> 01:04:30,742
Oh, God. Oh, God, Seth!

592
01:04:30,988 --> 01:04:32,828
You look so pretty.

593
01:04:33,364 --> 01:04:35,114
What will happen?

594
01:04:35,571 --> 01:04:38,861
I think it's showing itself
as a bizarre form of cancer.

595
01:04:39,446 --> 01:04:44,276
General cellular chaos and revolution.
I'm just gonna disintegrate.

596
01:04:44,479 --> 01:04:46,569
In a novel way, no doubt.

597
01:04:47,435 --> 01:04:48,525
Then I'll die.

598
01:04:49,232 --> 01:04:53,022
-And then it will be over.
-No, I don't accept that.

599
01:04:53,267 --> 01:04:56,987
There must be something we can do,
someone to go to, tests to be done.

600
01:04:57,181 --> 01:05:01,771
No! I won't be
just another tumorous bore...

601
01:05:01,975 --> 01:05:06,145
...talking about his hair falling out
and his lost lymph nodes.

602
01:05:07,097 --> 01:05:09,477
What do you want me to do?
Why did you call me?

603
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,130
That's disgusting.

604
01:05:38,424 --> 01:05:39,634
My...

605
01:05:40,421 --> 01:05:42,251
...ear. No!

606
01:05:43,457 --> 01:05:45,297
I'm scared.

607
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:49,880
Help me.

608
01:05:51,246 --> 01:05:54,456
Please, please, help me.

609
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:06,250
-Don't go back to him.
-That's it?

610
01:06:06,455 --> 01:06:07,535
That's your advice?

611
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:10,873
It could be contagious.
It could become an epidemic.

612
01:06:11,079 --> 01:06:12,829
I have to go back to him.

613
01:06:13,366 --> 01:06:16,906
-I don't believe this.
-If you saw him, Stathis....

614
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:20,700
If you saw how scared and angry
and desperate he is--

615
01:06:20,945 --> 01:06:23,825
I'm sure Typhoid Mary was nice
when you saw her socially.

616
01:06:24,071 --> 01:06:26,151
-I do not want--
-I don't care!

617
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:28,357
All right, fine, okay.

618
01:06:42,146 --> 01:06:44,606
Do I have permission to claim
your body when this is over?

619
01:06:45,641 --> 01:06:47,481
Oh, God....

620
01:06:50,304 --> 01:06:52,144
Look, how about this?

621
01:06:54,888 --> 01:06:57,938
You say, if only I saw him.

622
01:06:58,433 --> 01:06:59,853
Show me.

623
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:02,100
Tape him. Show me.

624
01:07:02,887 --> 01:07:04,637
Let me think about it.

625
01:07:06,552 --> 01:07:08,392
I'll come up with something.

626
01:07:35,621 --> 01:07:36,871
Seth?

627
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:44,620
Seth?

628
01:07:44,868 --> 01:07:46,868
No, no, no. Up here.

629
01:07:50,371 --> 01:07:52,371
I've gotten pretty good at it.

630
01:07:53,077 --> 01:07:55,247
Yeah, it's almost second nature.

631
01:07:56,363 --> 01:07:58,533
I stopped biting my nails.

632
01:08:03,612 --> 01:08:05,702
Look at this. What's this?

633
01:08:06,818 --> 01:08:08,028
I don't know.

634
01:08:11,941 --> 01:08:15,401
I seem to be stricken by a disease
with a purpose, wouldn't you say?

635
01:08:20,070 --> 01:08:23,530
Maybe not such a bad disease
after all.

636
01:08:24,144 --> 01:08:25,234
I can't stay.

637
01:08:25,772 --> 01:08:26,852
No, no, no.

638
01:08:28,608 --> 01:08:30,188
Why not? Why can't you?

639
01:08:30,685 --> 01:08:32,355
I can't take it. It's too much.

640
01:08:32,562 --> 01:08:35,142
Why? The disease
has revealed its purpose.

641
01:08:35,348 --> 01:08:39,768
We don't have to worry about
contagion. I know what it wants.

642
01:08:40,262 --> 01:08:41,602
What does it want?

643
01:08:42,219 --> 01:08:46,229
It wants to turn me
into something else.

644
01:08:46,802 --> 01:08:49,762
Most people would give anything
to be something else.

645
01:08:50,008 --> 01:08:51,428
Turned into what?

646
01:08:51,636 --> 01:08:55,806
What do you think, a fly?
Am I becoming a 185-pound fly?

647
01:08:56,679 --> 01:08:59,259
No, I'm becoming something
that never existed.

648
01:08:59,505 --> 01:09:01,965
I'm becoming "Brundlefly."

649
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:05,220
That's worth a Nobel Prize.

650
01:09:06,925 --> 01:09:08,255
Here.

651
01:09:08,792 --> 01:09:12,092
I want to give a demonstration...

652
01:09:12,257 --> 01:09:17,387
...that I think you'll want
to record for posterity.

653
01:09:18,089 --> 01:09:20,249
I think you must chronicle...

654
01:09:20,456 --> 01:09:23,506
...the life and times of Brundlefly,
don't you?

655
01:09:24,121 --> 01:09:28,291
At the very least, it should make
a fabulous children's book.

656
01:09:28,874 --> 01:09:29,994
You seem tired.

657
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,210
You got me there?

658
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,160
How does Brundlefly eat?

659
01:09:41,367 --> 01:09:44,327
He found out the hard way
that he eats like a fly eats.

660
01:09:44,532 --> 01:09:46,282
His teeth are now useless.

661
01:09:46,490 --> 01:09:49,950
Although he can chew up
solid food, he can't digest it.

662
01:09:50,194 --> 01:09:53,574
Solid food hurts. So, like a fly...

663
01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:58,280
...Brundlefly breaks down solids
with a corrosive enzyme...

664
01:09:58,523 --> 01:10:00,783
...playfully called "vomit drop. "

665
01:10:00,990 --> 01:10:03,950
He regurgitates on his food.
It liquifies.

666
01:10:04,275 --> 01:10:06,615
And then he sucks back up.

667
01:10:07,271 --> 01:10:09,361
Ready for a demonstration, kids?

668
01:10:10,027 --> 01:10:11,607
Here it goes.

669
01:10:12,943 --> 01:10:15,193
Oh, my God.

670
01:10:16,688 --> 01:10:18,268
My God!

671
01:10:25,765 --> 01:10:27,265
Hey, Ronnie.

672
01:10:30,638 --> 01:10:32,058
Ronnie!

673
01:10:40,595 --> 01:10:42,015
What is it?

674
01:10:48,923 --> 01:10:50,343
I'm pregnant.

675
01:10:51,469 --> 01:10:53,299
Oh, no.

676
01:10:56,423 --> 01:10:57,843
Oh, no.

677
01:11:00,297 --> 01:11:02,627
I'm pregnant with Seth's baby.

678
01:11:11,332 --> 01:11:12,832
What do you want to do?

679
01:11:15,915 --> 01:11:17,205
I don't know.

680
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:21,830
I just....

681
01:11:21,997 --> 01:11:23,497
I don't know.

682
01:11:51,147 --> 01:11:54,907
-Stathis, I'm scared.
-It's going to be all right, Ronnie.

683
01:11:55,521 --> 01:11:57,191
It's going to be fine.

684
01:11:57,398 --> 01:11:59,568
I don't think I want to lose it.

685
01:11:59,775 --> 01:12:04,115
-Why am I losing it?
-It's better this way. You'll see.

686
01:12:05,147 --> 01:12:07,397
It's the best thing that could happen.

687
01:12:08,143 --> 01:12:12,903
She's expelling it. It's coming out.
I don't think we'll have to go in.

688
01:12:13,096 --> 01:12:16,146
It's gonna be easy.
Don't worry, honey.

689
01:12:16,851 --> 01:12:20,141
No. Please, no.

690
01:12:20,636 --> 01:12:22,396
It'll be over soon. Here we go.

691
01:12:27,057 --> 01:12:29,927
A little suction here.
A little suction.

692
01:12:32,469 --> 01:12:35,009
Hold on a minute.
There's more in there.

693
01:12:35,505 --> 01:12:39,135
-There's more?
-Yeah, I mean a lot more. Okay.

694
01:12:40,009 --> 01:12:42,089
You're gonna have to help us.
Push.

695
01:12:42,336 --> 01:12:44,886
Push it out. Come on, push.

696
01:12:45,132 --> 01:12:48,262
-That's it. Come on, push.
-No, wait.

697
01:12:48,667 --> 01:12:51,377
Give us a push. You can push it out.
Come on.

698
01:12:51,543 --> 01:12:53,793
No, wait, wait. No.

699
01:12:53,999 --> 01:12:55,289
You can do it.

700
01:12:55,747 --> 01:12:57,047
Wait.

701
01:12:58,793 --> 01:13:00,293
No!

702
01:14:11,761 --> 01:14:14,561
I want a disc.
Give me preliminary integration.

703
01:14:14,717 --> 01:14:16,977
I want a disc.
Give me preliminary integration.

704
01:15:01,742 --> 01:15:05,702
You're relics. Yes, you are.
You can't deny it.

705
01:15:05,946 --> 01:15:10,876
Vestigial, archaeological, redundant.

706
01:15:14,035 --> 01:15:16,495
Artifacts of a bygone era.

707
01:15:16,781 --> 01:15:19,201
Of historical interest only.

708
01:15:41,057 --> 01:15:43,357
You've missed some good moments.

709
01:15:44,473 --> 01:15:46,893
Is that why you're here? To catch up?

710
01:15:52,062 --> 01:15:53,352
I wanted....

711
01:15:59,592 --> 01:16:01,762
My teeth have begun to fall out.

712
01:16:03,766 --> 01:16:07,556
The medicine cabinet's now
the Brundle Museum of Natural History.

713
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:08,930
Want to see it?

714
01:16:09,887 --> 01:16:11,297
No.

715
01:16:13,712 --> 01:16:14,802
Then...

716
01:16:16,758 --> 01:16:18,178
...what do you want?

717
01:16:21,252 --> 01:16:23,962
I came to tell you....

718
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:31,460
I just....

719
01:16:32,995 --> 01:16:35,965
I wanted to see you...

720
01:16:36,121 --> 01:16:37,711
...before....

721
01:16:46,537 --> 01:16:48,367
You have to leave now...

722
01:16:50,072 --> 01:16:51,742
...and never come back here.

723
01:16:56,533 --> 01:17:00,413
Have you heard of insect politics?

724
01:17:02,484 --> 01:17:03,994
Neither have I.

725
01:17:07,697 --> 01:17:11,657
Insects don't have politics.

726
01:17:13,070 --> 01:17:15,610
They're very brutal.

727
01:17:16,814 --> 01:17:18,564
No compassion.

728
01:17:18,732 --> 01:17:20,822
No compromise.

729
01:17:21,937 --> 01:17:24,357
We can't trust the insect.

730
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:28,940
I'd like to become...

731
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:33,107
...the first insect politician.

732
01:17:34,430 --> 01:17:36,270
I'd like to...

733
01:17:38,934 --> 01:17:40,434
...but I'm afraid....

734
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:44,060
I don't know
what you're trying to say.

735
01:17:45,435 --> 01:17:46,845
I'm saying....

736
01:17:55,051 --> 01:17:57,471
I'm saying I'm an insect...

737
01:17:58,796 --> 01:18:02,556
...who dreamt he was a man
and loved it.

738
01:18:02,801 --> 01:18:04,971
But now the dream is over...

739
01:18:05,377 --> 01:18:07,047
...and the insect is awake.

740
01:18:08,593 --> 01:18:10,173
No, Seth.

741
01:18:11,878 --> 01:18:13,718
I'm saying...

742
01:18:16,372 --> 01:18:18,712
...I'll hurt you if you stay.

743
01:18:58,064 --> 01:19:00,074
Let's go. Let's do it now.

744
01:19:00,231 --> 01:19:03,281
Now? Wait.
Wait a minute. What did he say?

745
01:19:03,896 --> 01:19:06,616
I couldn't tell him.
Let's go, damn it.

746
01:19:06,812 --> 01:19:09,442
No! I think we should
wait a few days.

747
01:19:09,688 --> 01:19:11,278
You're not
in the right state of mind.

748
01:19:11,855 --> 01:19:14,815
I want it out of my body now.
You should have seen him.

749
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:17,480
There could be anything in here,
in me, in my body.

750
01:19:17,727 --> 01:19:20,777
I don't know if I can
arrange it now, tonight.

751
01:19:20,972 --> 01:19:22,232
Why do we have to--?

752
01:19:22,430 --> 01:19:27,560
I don't want it. Understand?
I don't want it in my body!

753
01:20:01,456 --> 01:20:04,336
Well, okay, what's the story?

754
01:20:07,088 --> 01:20:09,338
She's pregnant
and she wants an abortion.

755
01:20:09,874 --> 01:20:11,294
In the middle of the night?

756
01:20:13,459 --> 01:20:15,749
We have good reason to think that...

757
01:20:15,956 --> 01:20:19,496
...this child will be deformed.

758
01:20:19,910 --> 01:20:22,870
-Yeah, but in the middle of the night?
-Look, Brent.

759
01:20:24,913 --> 01:20:26,033
Please.

760
01:20:28,329 --> 01:20:29,409
Is it your child?

761
01:20:30,406 --> 01:20:31,366
No.

762
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:39,080
It's the child of a man
who is deformed.

763
01:20:40,781 --> 01:20:42,281
I don't mean to interfere...

764
01:20:42,449 --> 01:20:46,369
...but I detect a certain
uncertainty here.

765
01:20:46,613 --> 01:20:49,483
There are tests we can do
to determine whether--

766
01:20:49,729 --> 01:20:53,909
I don't want tests.
Tests can't guarantee anything.

767
01:20:54,233 --> 01:20:57,443
The baby could start off normal,
then become....

768
01:21:00,524 --> 01:21:02,024
I want an abortion.

769
01:21:04,978 --> 01:21:07,228
I'll do it myself if I have to.

770
01:21:08,313 --> 01:21:12,193
If you'll slip into that,
we'll be on our way in no time.

771
01:21:39,050 --> 01:21:40,090
No.

772
01:21:43,714 --> 01:21:45,714
Wait, Seth, no.

773
01:22:11,286 --> 01:22:13,626
Why did you want to kill Brundle?

774
01:22:14,831 --> 01:22:19,871
The baby might be all that's left
of the real me.

775
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:24,070
Please don't kill me.

776
01:22:25,736 --> 01:22:29,036
I can't have it. I'm afraid.

777
01:22:29,321 --> 01:22:33,031
Please, have the baby.

778
01:22:33,774 --> 01:22:34,824
I can't.

779
01:22:35,362 --> 01:22:37,192
I can't.

780
01:22:39,107 --> 01:22:40,697
Too bad.

781
01:22:45,568 --> 01:22:47,148
Too bad.

782
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:10,219
Jesus!

783
01:26:18,942 --> 01:26:22,322
No, don't. Don't, please.

784
01:26:22,647 --> 01:26:23,937
Please.

785
01:26:46,843 --> 01:26:48,093
Help me.

786
01:26:48,930 --> 01:26:49,970
Help me be human.

787
01:26:51,806 --> 01:26:53,096
How?

788
01:27:00,884 --> 01:27:02,304
Well....

789
01:27:05,627 --> 01:27:07,297
I go there...

790
01:27:09,791 --> 01:27:11,301
...and you go there.

791
01:27:15,793 --> 01:27:18,503
We come apart...

792
01:27:18,879 --> 01:27:23,459
...and then we come together there.

793
01:27:26,079 --> 01:27:28,879
You, me and the baby.

794
01:27:30,163 --> 01:27:31,203
Together.

795
01:27:48,567 --> 01:27:49,617
No....

796
01:27:50,655 --> 01:27:52,905
We'll be the ultimate family.

797
01:27:53,361 --> 01:27:57,781
A family of three,
joined together in one body.

798
01:27:59,113 --> 01:28:01,193
More human than I am alone.

799
01:28:02,648 --> 01:28:04,948
No, no!

800
01:28:26,974 --> 01:28:29,224
Oh, God. Please!

801
01:28:41,764 --> 01:28:44,554
Oh, God, please!

802
01:32:20,839 --> 01:32:23,009
No, I can't.

803
01:32:24,924 --> 01:32:26,504
I can't.
