1
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:59,254
There's an accident on the course.

2
00:06:53,768 --> 00:06:56,730
- How'd you do?
- Half a second slower than Hinsch.

3
00:06:56,855 --> 00:06:59,274
I was half a second slower
than the last Cuban.

4
00:06:59,983 --> 00:07:02,193
- Where'd you finish?
- Fourth.

5
00:07:02,318 --> 00:07:04,028
That's not so bad.

6
00:07:11,202 --> 00:07:12,829
He's still under morphine.

7
00:07:35,894 --> 00:07:38,480
Trans World Airlines announces

8
00:07:38,605 --> 00:07:44,778
the arrival of the flight
Starstream ASV0 from New York.

9
00:07:50,742 --> 00:07:51,784
What?

10
00:07:52,577 --> 00:07:53,745
Box three.

11
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:09,344
Hello?

12
00:08:12,514 --> 00:08:14,057
Hey, how do you get... Hello?

13
00:08:15,475 --> 00:08:17,310
This is Dave Chappellet.

14
00:08:18,394 --> 00:08:19,938
I'm here at the airport.

15
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:22,607
Yeah.

16
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:25,485
Yeah.

17
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:29,405
All right. How do I get there?

18
00:08:31,741 --> 00:08:33,076
Yeah. Who?

19
00:08:36,454 --> 00:08:37,872
No, I never have.

20
00:08:39,707 --> 00:08:43,169
Yeah, okay. I said okay.
No one told me about anybody else.

21
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,144
Excuse me.

22
00:10:02,331 --> 00:10:04,959
No, I don't want a reservation.
I have a reservation.

23
00:10:06,294 --> 00:10:07,795
Yes, it was made a month ago.

24
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:13,426
Glad you two got together.

25
00:10:13,551 --> 00:10:15,970
- Hey, Mayo. How are you, buddy?
- D.K., how are you?

26
00:10:16,095 --> 00:10:17,305
- Long time no see.
- How are you doing?

27
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,557
- Did you have a good trip?
- Will you talk to him, please?

28
00:10:19,682 --> 00:10:21,309
Tell him we have a letter confirming it.

29
00:10:21,434 --> 00:10:22,560
Nice to see you.

30
00:10:22,685 --> 00:10:26,314
I think you're in room 44
or something like that.

31
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:28,274
We're paying with...

32
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:32,236
It got through American Express.
Don't tell me not to shout!

33
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,907
You know what that is?

34
00:11:19,617 --> 00:11:20,785
Yeah.

35
00:11:29,877 --> 00:11:31,629
Hey, where do you know Mayo from?

36
00:11:31,754 --> 00:11:35,049
From Dartmouth.
I was one of the Olympic hopefuls.

37
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:37,134
I was hopeful, not them.

38
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:38,719
Mayo's okay.

39
00:11:40,972 --> 00:11:42,306
Dartmouth.

40
00:12:01,575 --> 00:12:04,036
- Chappellet? Johnny Creech.
- Yeah, I know.

41
00:12:04,161 --> 00:12:05,371
You know Kipsmith?

42
00:12:05,496 --> 00:12:08,457
- Hey, how's it going?
- Yeah, what do you say?

43
00:12:10,334 --> 00:12:12,712
Hey, Stiles, you're sure
you want to ski today?

44
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,260
- Who's this?
- He's a German. I don't know who he is.

45
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:23,556
- Is this Bryan?
- Yeah.

46
00:12:31,814 --> 00:12:34,483
- Not bad.
- Too much style.

47
00:12:36,277 --> 00:12:37,528
Who's next? Chappellet?

48
00:12:37,653 --> 00:12:38,988
- Okay.
- Okay.

49
00:13:13,981 --> 00:13:15,816
- What do you have?
- 28.8.

50
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,193
That's what I have.

51
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,987
All right, here are the bibs.

52
00:13:29,288 --> 00:13:30,498
Can I have the salt?

53
00:13:35,461 --> 00:13:36,921
Eighty-eight?

54
00:13:38,297 --> 00:13:40,049
Yeah, you'll be starting
in the sixth group.

55
00:13:40,174 --> 00:13:41,926
It's the best we can get for you.

56
00:13:42,051 --> 00:13:45,262
You should be higher, but that's
all we could do for you right now.

57
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,432
What's the point of even racing?

58
00:13:50,851 --> 00:13:52,603
Same as always. You try to win.

59
00:13:52,728 --> 00:13:54,897
Starting 88th,
I'll be in ruts up to my knees.

60
00:13:55,022 --> 00:13:56,398
Probably.

61
00:13:57,566 --> 00:14:01,403
The officials have made a decision
about the break you're going to take.

62
00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:02,655
There'll be a five-minute pause after...

63
00:14:02,905 --> 00:14:05,866
- How come you didn't race?
- I don't know.

64
00:14:06,575 --> 00:14:08,202
But you had a start number.

65
00:14:13,374 --> 00:14:14,959
Well, I'll tell you, D.K.

66
00:14:18,546 --> 00:14:20,965
What is D.K. For?
What does that stand for?

67
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,424
My name.

68
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,430
- Is that really your name? D. K?
- Yeah, well, it's my initials.

69
00:14:28,556 --> 00:14:29,557
Your initials.

70
00:14:29,682 --> 00:14:30,808
Yeah, everybody's always called me that.

71
00:14:30,933 --> 00:14:33,477
- What's the "D" for?
- Nothing.

72
00:14:35,229 --> 00:14:38,774
- What is it, a name you don't like?
- I just don't use it, that's all.

73
00:14:41,402 --> 00:14:44,780
- What is it? Douglas?
- Nope.

74
00:14:49,285 --> 00:14:52,162
- How'd you do?
- Oh, I had a bad line.

75
00:14:52,288 --> 00:14:54,623
Picked the wrong line
and I was too slow going into flat.

76
00:14:54,748 --> 00:14:57,501
- Whereabouts did you come in?
- Way back.

77
00:15:01,964 --> 00:15:03,716
So how come you didn't race?

78
00:15:04,341 --> 00:15:07,261
- What did your friend Mayo tell you?
- Nothing.

79
00:15:07,845 --> 00:15:08,887
What happened?

80
00:15:09,013 --> 00:15:14,310
Well, they had me seeded about 150,
so I told them I didn't want to.

81
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:17,438
- You didn't want to?
- No.

82
00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:23,986
You should have raced.

83
00:15:46,675 --> 00:15:49,470
If I skied half as good
as I play cards, I'd be great.

84
00:15:51,013 --> 00:15:53,599
Big ten showing, dealer set.

85
00:15:55,225 --> 00:15:56,268
Good luck, Gabe.

86
00:15:56,393 --> 00:15:58,312
All right, here are the bibs.

87
00:16:00,856 --> 00:16:02,149
Creech, you're number 14.

88
00:16:02,274 --> 00:16:03,567
- Want to try it again?
- That's pretty good.

89
00:16:03,692 --> 00:16:04,860
Come on, okay?

90
00:16:05,027 --> 00:16:07,071
Stick with me, boy. You'll wear silk.

91
00:16:08,072 --> 00:16:09,156
Queen showing. Not bad.

92
00:16:09,281 --> 00:16:12,284
Hey, Alec, you ever race here?

93
00:16:14,203 --> 00:16:16,872
- Yeah.
- Make the top 10?

94
00:16:17,748 --> 00:16:19,416
Yeah, I finished second.

95
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,376
I'm serious.

96
00:16:26,006 --> 00:16:29,093
Bryan, you're number 98.
Gabriel, you're 44.

97
00:16:29,593 --> 00:16:31,345
Kipsmith, 66.

98
00:16:32,805 --> 00:16:34,807
Chappellet, you're number 79.

99
00:16:37,434 --> 00:16:40,145
You did so well last week,
they decided to move you up.

100
00:17:39,413 --> 00:17:40,414
Yeah.

101
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:41,748
What?

102
00:18:39,473 --> 00:18:43,226
- Time for number one.
- L. Brown, 2:31.39.

103
00:18:45,562 --> 00:18:47,189
On the course, number two.

104
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,563
Time run for team USA, 2:31.51 seconds.

105
00:20:15,694 --> 00:20:16,736
Alec?

106
00:20:16,862 --> 00:20:17,946
Right here.

107
00:20:18,071 --> 00:20:19,489
Moving down. See you.

108
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:45,987
I just thought you might like to know.
Your boy finished fourth.

109
00:23:46,487 --> 00:23:47,780
Is that right?

110
00:23:47,906 --> 00:23:50,450
This new boy, this 79, he can win, too?

111
00:23:50,575 --> 00:23:51,826
What's his name? David Chappellet.

112
00:23:51,951 --> 00:23:54,078
You will consider him
for the FIS team, yes?

113
00:23:54,203 --> 00:23:57,498
Well, we haven't...
We haven't selected a team yet.

114
00:23:57,624 --> 00:24:00,585
We still have a couple days.
Creech, of course, that's obvious.

115
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:03,755
This Chappellet, is he...
Is it his first season?

116
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,258
No, he's raced in the United States.
It's his first season in Europe.

117
00:24:07,717 --> 00:24:09,969
Dave. Dave, come over here, will you?

118
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,351
We wanted to congratulate you.
That was quite a showing you made.

119
00:24:16,476 --> 00:24:19,604
Yeah, maybe next time
I'll get to start in the top 50.

120
00:24:25,485 --> 00:24:28,446
Oh, we have to be going.
We'll see you in Kitzbühel.

121
00:24:35,787 --> 00:24:36,955
Dave.

122
00:24:38,623 --> 00:24:39,999
Come here.

123
00:24:44,462 --> 00:24:47,548
Look, you're going
to be doing quite a bit of this.

124
00:24:47,674 --> 00:24:49,926
I know you like to joke around,
but they don't.

125
00:24:50,051 --> 00:24:51,886
But one thing they do know,
and that everyone knows,

126
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:53,971
you have to earn your starting spot.

127
00:24:54,097 --> 00:24:56,933
- Now I'm going to fight for you. I will.
- I wasn't joking.

128
00:25:00,186 --> 00:25:04,857
Look, you finished fourth in one race.
Don't expect to be given the world.

129
00:25:06,192 --> 00:25:08,194
I don't expect to be given anything.

130
00:25:09,904 --> 00:25:12,240
Good. Get in the bus.

131
00:25:15,326 --> 00:25:17,578
Good afternoon, ladies and...

132
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:20,957
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

133
00:25:21,082 --> 00:25:23,126
- This is Ron Engel.
- And Bruce Devore.

134
00:25:23,251 --> 00:25:25,128
Here at the Hahnenkamm
in Kitzbühel, Austria,

135
00:25:25,253 --> 00:25:29,173
to bring you the FIS World Skiing
Championships being run here this week.

136
00:25:29,298 --> 00:25:32,260
Now, these championships are held
every other year with the Olympics

137
00:25:32,385 --> 00:25:34,011
taking their place every fourth year.

138
00:25:34,137 --> 00:25:37,473
Now, Bruce, you've been here before in
Kitzbühel, and it's truly a beautiful town.

139
00:25:37,598 --> 00:25:39,767
The kind of town, really,
for which Europe is famous.

140
00:25:39,892 --> 00:25:43,229
Many great, great old hotels,
and, of course, Kitzbühel is known

141
00:25:43,354 --> 00:25:44,897
for its many ski champions.

142
00:25:45,022 --> 00:25:49,193
Now on the downhill course today, you're
going to see the greatest skiers in the world.

143
00:25:49,318 --> 00:25:53,406
Skiers from 17 countries.
Champions past, champions yet to be.

144
00:25:54,782 --> 00:25:56,367
There's number one, Peter Haas.

145
00:25:56,701 --> 00:25:59,704
He's the only member
of the German team in the top seeding.

146
00:26:00,413 --> 00:26:04,292
And over here, number 13,
hidden a little bit there on the right,

147
00:26:04,417 --> 00:26:05,626
there's Istel of France.

148
00:26:05,751 --> 00:26:08,212
You know, Ron, the great
Austrian-French rivalry

149
00:26:08,337 --> 00:26:10,590
which has served to define the sport
for the last 10 years

150
00:26:10,715 --> 00:26:13,176
is essentially being carried on
by Jacques Boyriven.

151
00:26:13,301 --> 00:26:15,970
He's had the best year by far
of anyone on the French team.

152
00:26:16,095 --> 00:26:20,099
He's strong in all the events, but
downhill is his speciality. And here's...

153
00:26:20,224 --> 00:26:23,561
Here's the great Austrian, Max Meier.
Meier's 31 years old,

154
00:26:23,686 --> 00:26:26,147
and has been in international racing
for the past 17 years.

155
00:26:26,272 --> 00:26:27,815
And over there on the right
is Johnny Creech,

156
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,859
upon whom the American hopes
are riding today.

157
00:26:29,984 --> 00:26:32,320
He was fourth...
Fourth or fifth in the Lauberhorn,

158
00:26:32,445 --> 00:26:35,031
which is the oldest
and perhaps the most important

159
00:26:35,156 --> 00:26:37,158
of all the European races.
Or is Kitzbühel the oldest?

160
00:26:37,283 --> 00:26:38,367
There's Chappellet of the United States.

161
00:26:38,492 --> 00:26:40,995
Oh, I should mention a young man
seeded in the second group

162
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,165
on the basis of a stunning performance
when starting way back.

163
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:46,292
I think he was 79. Was it 79, Bruce?

164
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:48,711
Well, I think it was
in the Kandahar at Saint Anton.

165
00:26:48,836 --> 00:26:52,924
He finished fourth just behind Boyriven.
There he is, number 23.

166
00:26:53,466 --> 00:26:55,218
Oh, wait a minute.
I'm sorry, we've got the wrong...

167
00:26:55,343 --> 00:26:56,969
There he is now.
We're on him now. Number 23,

168
00:26:57,094 --> 00:27:00,348
Dave Chappellet from Idaho Springs...
Idaho Springs, Colorado.

169
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:09,690
Johnny Creech, 2:17, 2:18, 2:19, 2:20.

170
00:27:10,316 --> 00:27:12,526
His time, 2:21.06.

171
00:27:13,653 --> 00:27:14,820
That's a good time for Creech.

172
00:27:14,946 --> 00:27:17,573
He's only sixth, but as you can see,
he's very popular over here.

173
00:27:18,449 --> 00:27:20,743
Looks like Boyriven
is already celebrating a victory.

174
00:27:20,868 --> 00:27:23,537
Well, that time of 2. 17.92
is going to be hard to beat.

175
00:27:25,164 --> 00:27:26,248
Alec?

176
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:28,417
Yeah.

177
00:27:28,626 --> 00:27:30,419
- Where's Chappellet?
- Right here.

178
00:27:31,504 --> 00:27:33,923
- Tell him to uncork one.
- Okay.

179
00:27:34,966 --> 00:27:37,259
Now here's David Chappellet
of the United States.

180
00:27:59,532 --> 00:28:03,911
He's off. The American team's last real
chance in these FIS World Championships.

181
00:28:04,036 --> 00:28:05,079
How does he look to you, Bruce?

182
00:28:05,204 --> 00:28:08,541
He's new on the team, as you know,
but he's already made a sensational showing.

183
00:28:08,666 --> 00:28:10,167
He's doing the upper part very well.

184
00:28:18,467 --> 00:28:19,969
Chappellet. American.

185
00:28:33,065 --> 00:28:35,192
His interval time is 1:08.

186
00:28:35,317 --> 00:28:37,903
1:08. Now that's the fastest so far.

187
00:28:38,028 --> 00:28:39,405
He's coming to the bumps now.

188
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:42,324
- Oh, he's having difficulties... He's...
- Here's the second...

189
00:28:57,506 --> 00:28:59,967
The snow was cut to hell
by the time I started.

190
00:29:01,218 --> 00:29:03,679
It was bad. It was really bad.
There were holes.

191
00:29:04,054 --> 00:29:05,848
They were, I mean...

192
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,350
It would be hard on top
and soft underneath.

193
00:29:08,476 --> 00:29:11,270
If I could have started
five places ahead, just five,

194
00:29:11,395 --> 00:29:13,272
then I would've at least had good snow.

195
00:29:13,397 --> 00:29:14,648
I wouldn't have lost
my balance in the ruts.

196
00:29:14,773 --> 00:29:16,942
- I wouldn't have had to pull so hard...
- No.

197
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:19,820
What do you mean, "No"?

198
00:29:20,863 --> 00:29:23,616
If I'd have started in the first 15,
I could've won it.

199
00:29:23,741 --> 00:29:24,909
No.

200
00:29:25,868 --> 00:29:28,245
You just weren't good enough, that's all.

201
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,247
You lost your strength,
and then the bumps took you out.

202
00:29:30,372 --> 00:29:32,500
That's it. That's all there was to it.

203
00:29:33,792 --> 00:29:36,462
You got to have your strength
right up to the end.

204
00:29:39,715 --> 00:29:42,593
These guys aren't amateurs,
they're national heroes.

205
00:29:42,718 --> 00:29:45,638
You're trying to beat them
out of their way of life.

206
00:29:46,639 --> 00:29:48,515
You're just not strong enough.

207
00:29:52,895 --> 00:29:56,523
Well, I'll take a Charles Atlas course this
summer and build myself up, all right?

208
00:29:58,692 --> 00:29:59,818
Okay.

209
00:30:32,893 --> 00:30:34,311
All right, that's it.

210
00:30:36,647 --> 00:30:38,774
Chappellet, how do you feel? Tired?

211
00:30:40,943 --> 00:30:42,486
Give me two more laps.

212
00:30:45,364 --> 00:30:48,909
- What?
- Two more laps.

213
00:30:50,077 --> 00:30:52,579
- Are you kidding?
- No, we got time.

214
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:55,624
- How do you feel, John?
- Cool.

215
00:31:15,602 --> 00:31:18,480
Talk and move. Talk and move.

216
00:31:18,856 --> 00:31:22,276
Europeans simply can't understand why

217
00:31:22,401 --> 00:31:24,903
this country doesn't turn out
the world's greatest ski teams.

218
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:27,281
And I'm ashamed to tell them the truth.

219
00:31:27,406 --> 00:31:31,201
We have the mountains,
we have the men, we have the muscle.

220
00:31:31,827 --> 00:31:34,413
We don't have the money
in this richest nation in the world.

221
00:31:34,538 --> 00:31:38,333
Every racer on
a well-equipped winning team

222
00:31:38,917 --> 00:31:42,045
is a foreign sales representative
for U.S. Ski products.

223
00:31:42,171 --> 00:31:44,923
These fine young competitors
that we are training

224
00:31:45,048 --> 00:31:48,051
are roving ambassadors
for the American way of life.

225
00:32:14,703 --> 00:32:16,079
Thanks a lot.

226
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:33,263
Hey, Dad.

227
00:32:34,181 --> 00:32:35,349
David.

228
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:37,976
How you doing?

229
00:32:51,073 --> 00:32:54,785
- So, how've you been?
- I got your postcard from France.

230
00:32:55,494 --> 00:32:56,787
Oh, yeah?

231
00:32:57,996 --> 00:33:00,457
Your cousin said to thank you
for the stamps.

232
00:33:02,417 --> 00:33:05,921
Yeah, I was all over Europe.
Dad, I was in... I was in Austria,

233
00:33:06,046 --> 00:33:09,716
I was in France, Switzerland, Germany.

234
00:33:17,808 --> 00:33:19,768
I've just been training out in Oregon.

235
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,814
That's really great country.

236
00:33:36,743 --> 00:33:40,455
- I'm on the U.S. Ski team, you know?
- Yeah.

237
00:33:41,331 --> 00:33:44,293
They had your picture
on some paper in town.

238
00:35:08,126 --> 00:35:12,422
- I see you still got the old Chev, huh?
- Well, it runs pretty good.

239
00:35:15,926 --> 00:35:21,306
Hey, why don't you knock off for a while
and ride into town? I'll buy you a beer.

240
00:35:22,265 --> 00:35:24,684
Keys are in it, if that's what you want.

241
00:35:50,377 --> 00:35:52,504
So Long Ago, Bobby Greensboro
trying to grab you and a-groove you.

242
00:35:52,629 --> 00:35:54,214
It's nine before four is what it is.

243
00:35:54,339 --> 00:35:56,883
Do you know we have 88 degrees
right here in downtown Denver,

244
00:35:57,008 --> 00:35:59,594
and a good chance of rain? So take care.

245
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:03,557
KZOK in Denver

246
00:36:03,682 --> 00:36:07,477
Country music, country music

247
00:36:07,602 --> 00:36:09,563
Mind some business, preferably your own.

248
00:36:09,688 --> 00:36:12,274
Our business is playing top tunes,
and here's Hank Hopkins,

249
00:36:12,399 --> 00:36:14,276
It was a Long Happy Day.

250
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,292
I better go.

251
00:36:38,174 --> 00:36:40,135
I'm not talking to you.

252
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:44,264
Who's talking about talking?
Come on, get in.

253
00:36:45,974 --> 00:36:48,059
You didn't tell me you were leaving.

254
00:36:53,148 --> 00:36:54,691
Well, I'm back.

255
00:36:55,984 --> 00:36:57,736
Come on, get in.

256
00:37:01,448 --> 00:37:02,699
Come on.

257
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:10,373
I'll see you later, kids.
I'm going for a ride with Dave.

258
00:38:32,497 --> 00:38:37,502
I... I've got a chance to go to Denver
this fall and study dental hygiene.

259
00:38:38,169 --> 00:38:41,297
Of course, if I do that, it means
finding an apartment and everything.

260
00:38:41,422 --> 00:38:44,342
And then Pam, she went...
You remember Pam Houser?

261
00:38:44,467 --> 00:38:46,845
She's going to Yellowstone
to work as a waitress.

262
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:51,015
She wanted me to come with her.
And afterwards, we could travel.

263
00:38:51,474 --> 00:38:56,813
I'd sort of like to see everything.
It's a... It's such a big decision to make.

264
00:38:58,314 --> 00:39:01,734
- Well, what do you think I should do?
- I don't know.

265
00:39:01,985 --> 00:39:03,820
You got any more of that gum?

266
00:39:15,999 --> 00:39:18,001
Well, you're back early.

267
00:39:37,228 --> 00:39:40,898
- What's happened to the water?
- Gone bad, isn't it?

268
00:39:42,191 --> 00:39:45,445
- Want some coffee?
- Yeah.

269
00:40:30,948 --> 00:40:33,826
Well, I guess you've been doing all right.

270
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:38,831
- Won some races.
- Yeah. I had a pretty good year.

271
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:43,127
- Win any money?
- Money?

272
00:40:43,878 --> 00:40:47,215
No, see, we're thinking ahead
two years. For the Olympics.

273
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:50,760
The Olympics.
The Olympics ain't for money.

274
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:54,305
No, but for after. Afterwards.

275
00:40:57,225 --> 00:40:59,727
- So that's how it works, huh?
- Yeah, it can,

276
00:40:59,852 --> 00:41:03,189
because, you know, you put together
two good years and you win a couple...

277
00:41:03,314 --> 00:41:06,234
Well, I just hope you don't end up
asking yourself the question

278
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:10,196
some folks ask me, "What's he do it for?"

279
00:41:12,365 --> 00:41:15,618
Well, I'll be famous. I'll be a champion.

280
00:41:20,832 --> 00:41:22,667
World's full of them.

281
00:42:44,665 --> 00:42:47,793
I would never dream of
jeopardizing your amateur standing

282
00:42:47,918 --> 00:42:49,253
with the Olympics, Mr Creech.

283
00:42:49,378 --> 00:42:52,548
I want you to win
the Olympics using my skis.

284
00:43:06,187 --> 00:43:08,105
- Hey, who's that?
- Huh?

285
00:43:09,065 --> 00:43:11,442
- With Claire.
- Oh, that's... What's his name?

286
00:43:11,567 --> 00:43:13,736
The guy that makes... Machet.

287
00:43:13,861 --> 00:43:17,281
- No, no. I mean, who's she?
- Who knows?

288
00:43:17,406 --> 00:43:19,742
It's either his secretary or his niece.

289
00:43:25,414 --> 00:43:26,832
I'm going to wash up.

290
00:43:28,501 --> 00:43:29,794
You speak French?

291
00:44:49,373 --> 00:44:50,499
Dave.

292
00:44:50,624 --> 00:44:53,335
- Did you meet Mr Machet?
- How do you do, Mr Chappellet?

293
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:57,256
- And Carole... No, I'm sorry, Miss...
- Miss Stahl.

294
00:44:57,381 --> 00:44:59,174
- Miss Stahl.
- Delighted to meet you.

295
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,886
Please join us.
I've been hoping to meet you.

296
00:45:02,011 --> 00:45:03,762
And you know Bobby, of course.

297
00:45:06,181 --> 00:45:08,517
- Will you have tea?
- Good. Thanks.

298
00:45:08,642 --> 00:45:10,185
One cup of tea, please.

299
00:45:11,937 --> 00:45:14,398
That was a brilliant victory at Morzine.

300
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:17,818
- What skis did you use?
- Head skis.

301
00:45:18,152 --> 00:45:19,278
You like Heads?

302
00:45:20,571 --> 00:45:22,323
Yeah, they're okay.

303
00:45:22,781 --> 00:45:25,326
Mr Machet has long been
a friend of American racers.

304
00:45:25,451 --> 00:45:29,330
- He manufactures skis.
- The best in the world.

305
00:45:29,496 --> 00:45:32,917
I would never dream of jeopardizing
your amateur standing,

306
00:45:33,042 --> 00:45:36,211
but I want you to win
the Olympics using my skis

307
00:45:36,337 --> 00:45:40,007
so that I can advertise my
gold medal at the Olympics.

308
00:45:50,809 --> 00:45:54,188
Very few racers are good enough
to get the most out of my skis.

309
00:45:54,313 --> 00:45:57,232
Mr Creech here
has consented to try a pair.

310
00:45:58,525 --> 00:46:02,404
I would like you to try a pair, too,
with my compliments, of course.

311
00:46:27,221 --> 00:46:29,932
- Hello.
- Did you come to buy something?

312
00:46:32,768 --> 00:46:33,852
No.

313
00:46:35,437 --> 00:46:37,439
Well, I'm happy you stopped.

314
00:46:41,402 --> 00:46:42,653
Me, too.

315
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:48,158
- Would you like some?
- No, no. Yes.

316
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:51,036
Thank you.

317
00:47:00,963 --> 00:47:04,508
Do you always buy
one of these at a time or...

318
00:47:05,926 --> 00:47:08,262
- You like it?
- Oh, yeah. I don't know.

319
00:47:09,012 --> 00:47:10,514
- You don't like it?
- Yeah, I do.

320
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:20,107
- I've been reading about you.
- You have?

321
00:47:20,232 --> 00:47:21,733
- Yes.
- Really? Where?

322
00:47:21,859 --> 00:47:23,193
Follow me.

323
00:47:28,365 --> 00:47:29,908
Oh, here it is.

324
00:47:54,683 --> 00:47:58,270
"The American, David Chappellet,
must have felt

325
00:47:59,021 --> 00:48:00,606
"still more disappointed.

326
00:48:00,731 --> 00:48:05,903
"In the final schuss, only Chappellet
was near Meier's top speed.

327
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:13,577
"He was at 132 kilometres an hour,
when deeper into the..."

328
00:48:16,955 --> 00:48:18,665
- I don't know the word.
- Well, go on.

329
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:23,128
Okay. "...and fell. A sad sight
as he tried, having only one ski,

330
00:48:23,253 --> 00:48:24,713
"to finish the race.

331
00:48:25,172 --> 00:48:29,426
"It wasn't sad, but to win
is everything, to place nothing."

332
00:48:30,886 --> 00:48:32,429
Do you live here?

333
00:48:33,013 --> 00:48:35,307
No, I'm only here for the week.
I'm working.

334
00:48:35,641 --> 00:48:38,602
Well, do you work for Machette...
Or Machet? Or...

335
00:48:39,561 --> 00:48:42,439
Yes. What did you think?

336
00:48:43,231 --> 00:48:46,860
Oh, no, I... Your uncle or... I don't know.

337
00:48:48,236 --> 00:48:50,364
Hey, read it again, okay?

338
00:49:04,378 --> 00:49:07,798
- I'll see you in a sec, all right?
- Well, take care of that, will you?

339
00:49:11,134 --> 00:49:12,552
- Hello.
- Hey.

340
00:49:14,971 --> 00:49:18,016
- Is this yours?
- Yes. You like it?

341
00:49:24,439 --> 00:49:25,982
Here, hold this.

342
00:49:30,278 --> 00:49:32,656
- You practising today?
- Yeah.

343
00:49:32,781 --> 00:49:34,950
- How's it going?
- Good.

344
00:49:35,075 --> 00:49:37,953
- Yeah?
- The snow's great.

345
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,287
- Is it?
- You bet.

346
00:51:30,732 --> 00:51:32,442
I thought you'd never stop.

347
00:51:33,151 --> 00:51:34,986
- Tired?
- A little.

348
00:51:37,072 --> 00:51:38,448
My legs.

349
00:51:39,282 --> 00:51:42,994
You see, it's right in here. When
you're forward, this takes all the action.

350
00:51:56,508 --> 00:51:58,009
Put the brakes on.

351
00:52:54,065 --> 00:52:56,651
I think it must be the most thrilling thing
in the whole world, don't you?

352
00:52:56,776 --> 00:52:59,195
And you have to be terribly strong,
even for a man.

353
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,281
Well, there is a girls' team, too.

354
00:53:01,406 --> 00:53:02,574
Oh, yes, of course. Where are they?

355
00:53:02,699 --> 00:53:04,200
Well, they're not here.
They're in Grindelwald.

356
00:53:04,325 --> 00:53:05,994
They don't really
do the same things, do they?

357
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:07,829
- Some of them do.
- Yes?

358
00:53:07,954 --> 00:53:10,290
- Well, some of the things.
- Oh, what do you mean?

359
00:53:10,415 --> 00:53:13,501
- Well, it's like you say, they...
- Actually, our girls have done...

360
00:53:13,626 --> 00:53:15,295
Done better in the Olympics than the men.

361
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:18,131
I mean, really?
Well, isn't that interesting.

362
00:53:18,465 --> 00:53:21,634
Tell me, why would a girl want to do it?

363
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,847
I mean, I wouldn't. First of all,
I just wouldn't have all that strength

364
00:53:25,972 --> 00:53:28,808
in the mornings and...
And the morning is important, isn't it?

365
00:53:28,933 --> 00:53:30,018
Well, a man in the morning...

366
00:53:30,143 --> 00:53:32,645
I think a man must feel stronger
in the morning.

367
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:35,607
- I think you're right.
- He certainly looks stronger.

368
00:53:35,732 --> 00:53:37,025
Well, you'd know more about that.

369
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:38,943
- You got a point, you know.
- I wonder.

370
00:53:39,068 --> 00:53:44,032
Well, you know, I think... I think
girls look stronger and feel stronger.

371
00:53:44,157 --> 00:53:45,200
Yes?

372
00:53:45,325 --> 00:53:47,243
I've known some girls who look
stronger, but when you...

373
00:53:47,368 --> 00:53:50,371
Yeah, we have some
very strong girls on the team.

374
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,708
And they have to get up very early.

375
00:53:53,833 --> 00:53:57,086
I'd say a girl that feels strong looks
strong, wouldn't you say that, Tony?

376
00:53:57,212 --> 00:54:00,256
- Or vice versa.
- Some do and some don't.

377
00:54:00,798 --> 00:54:02,926
Yes, you're probably right.

378
00:54:03,092 --> 00:54:07,430
Some of them must. Yes, of course. Yes.

379
00:54:14,771 --> 00:54:15,897
Well...

380
00:54:17,482 --> 00:54:19,067
Thank you.

381
00:54:20,443 --> 00:54:21,444
Oh.

382
00:54:23,029 --> 00:54:24,322
Excuse me.

383
00:54:28,785 --> 00:54:30,078
You what?

384
00:54:40,964 --> 00:54:44,092
Pardon me. Pardon me.
Are you David Chappellet?

385
00:54:44,801 --> 00:54:45,802
Yeah.

386
00:54:45,927 --> 00:54:48,388
Well, I'm doing a story on the team
and also on skiing.

387
00:54:48,513 --> 00:54:51,266
And I'd like to find out
everything I can about it.

388
00:54:51,557 --> 00:54:54,185
- I could never learn, could I?
- What?

389
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:56,688
I don't know, everything.

390
00:54:56,813 --> 00:55:00,149
Like for example, do you go
as fast as you can all the time?

391
00:55:00,275 --> 00:55:02,777
Yeah, I go as fast as I can.

392
00:55:02,902 --> 00:55:06,114
I know that sounds a little foolish,
almost stupid.

393
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:08,199
But I don't know really what to ask.

394
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,203
- Do you have to give up a lot? I mean...
- What?

395
00:55:12,328 --> 00:55:13,788
Do you mind my asking these questions?

396
00:55:13,913 --> 00:55:16,541
- No, I don't mind.
- All right, what I mean is...

397
00:55:16,666 --> 00:55:20,837
Well, do you practise...
Do you practise self-denial?

398
00:55:25,341 --> 00:55:27,844
- Part of the time.
- Fascinating.

399
00:55:28,386 --> 00:55:32,364
- Yeah? Really?
- Does it affect your strength?

400
00:55:41,524 --> 00:55:43,359
- Do you like that?
- Yeah.

401
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:53,261
- What are you doing?
- The boss pays.

402
00:55:53,386 --> 00:55:54,762
Thank you very much.

403
00:57:20,247 --> 00:57:23,709
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thanks.

404
00:57:33,886 --> 00:57:36,972
Look, if you have to get to bed,
I understand.

405
00:57:37,931 --> 00:57:40,100
I know everything about self-denial.

406
00:57:40,225 --> 00:57:42,686
No drinks, no late nights...

407
00:58:15,836 --> 00:58:17,129
3:15.

408
00:58:29,808 --> 00:58:32,477
Did you know how quick
your time was at the gate?

409
00:58:38,608 --> 00:58:41,778
No, I was by
before I even thought about it.

410
00:58:45,073 --> 00:58:46,408
- What?
- What are your plans for next year?

411
00:58:46,533 --> 00:58:49,286
- What about the light conditions?
- It's fine. It didn't bother me.

412
00:58:49,411 --> 00:58:51,538
- What are your plans for next season?
- I think I'd like to...

413
00:58:51,663 --> 00:58:53,915
Could you have run any better?

414
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:57,002
I guess you can always run better.

415
00:58:57,127 --> 00:59:01,548
- Tell me, how does it feel to have won?
- Feels great. What's your name?

416
00:59:01,673 --> 00:59:04,593
So Chappellet's just made the fastest time.
What do you think of his time?

417
00:59:04,718 --> 00:59:07,220
He still didn't beat the record, you know.

418
00:59:18,865 --> 00:59:20,325
...your success?

419
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:23,036
Well, has it made any difference to you?

420
00:59:26,123 --> 00:59:28,208
He's getting better all the time.

421
00:59:28,333 --> 00:59:29,751
...my friends over here.

422
00:59:30,752 --> 00:59:33,088
- No, no, I don't think so. We hoped.
- Jake!

423
00:59:33,213 --> 00:59:36,591
You know, what are you gonna do?

424
00:59:55,444 --> 00:59:59,573
All right, just tell the girls
we'll meet them 8:00 at the Tenne.

425
00:59:59,865 --> 01:00:02,409
Okay. So long.

426
01:00:02,534 --> 01:00:04,328
- Hey.
- How's it going?

427
01:00:04,661 --> 01:00:08,081
It was a damn good race today.
Thought I was going to beat you.

428
01:00:08,206 --> 01:00:11,668
Yeah, I had a good run.
Only missed one turn. Took it too wide.

429
01:00:11,793 --> 01:00:13,545
Only one turn, huh?

430
01:00:16,798 --> 01:00:17,966
Did you hear him?

431
01:00:18,091 --> 01:00:21,344
"I only missed one turn, you know,
just one because I'm really good.

432
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:23,680
"And if I hadn't gone wide
on that other one...

433
01:00:23,805 --> 01:00:25,599
"You know what?
I would have broken the record."

434
01:00:25,724 --> 01:00:27,517
Probably would have.

435
01:00:28,310 --> 01:00:30,645
He thinks he's the only guy
that ever won a downhill.

436
01:00:30,771 --> 01:00:33,523
He's as jazzed with himself as Max Meier.

437
01:00:35,692 --> 01:00:38,612
- That's not your style, is it, John?
- What?

438
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:40,906
Come on.

439
01:00:41,031 --> 01:00:44,284
All right, he's good and he's fast
and he wins a couple of races.

440
01:00:44,409 --> 01:00:48,205
And I'm the first one to admit
that a good racer turns everybody on.

441
01:00:48,330 --> 01:00:51,041
But he is not for the team
and he never will be.

442
01:00:51,166 --> 01:00:54,127
Well, it's not exactly a team sport, is it?

443
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:57,464
Maybe you're right.

444
01:02:08,885 --> 01:02:10,095
- Alec?
- Right here.

445
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:11,930
It's getting icier by the minute.

446
01:02:12,055 --> 01:02:13,556
- I'll tell him.
- He did 2:20.

447
01:02:13,682 --> 01:02:15,850
- What?
- Meier's time.

448
01:02:16,059 --> 01:02:17,394
Meier got 2:20.

449
01:02:58,601 --> 01:03:00,812
Why should I feel bad? I had a good year.

450
01:03:00,937 --> 01:03:02,480
I got myself seeded.

451
01:03:03,231 --> 01:03:04,441
Creech?

452
01:03:04,566 --> 01:03:07,068
Well, he wins sometimes, I win sometimes.

453
01:03:07,193 --> 01:03:08,945
We're both Americans.

454
01:03:09,237 --> 01:03:11,698
Good. I feel good. I do.

455
01:05:20,192 --> 01:05:23,362
I said the garage was having
trouble getting parts for the car.

456
01:05:23,487 --> 01:05:25,990
It would take them a day or two.

457
01:05:26,908 --> 01:05:31,120
Machet wants to send a car for me,
but I said I was quite content.

458
01:05:33,164 --> 01:05:34,332
Content?

459
01:05:36,459 --> 01:05:38,836
Machet always take such good care of you?

460
01:05:38,961 --> 01:05:41,422
Always. He's a very good boss.

461
01:05:43,633 --> 01:05:46,510
- He give you this?
- No, somebody else did.

462
01:05:49,138 --> 01:05:50,932
Before my time.

463
01:06:08,324 --> 01:06:11,035
You got a thing with Machet?
Something going?

464
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:13,704
Not exactly. We never made love.

465
01:06:18,042 --> 01:06:21,796
- What's wrong with him?
- Nothing. I just never wanted to.

466
01:06:30,805 --> 01:06:32,932
How do you feel about the season, Eugene?

467
01:06:33,057 --> 01:06:34,850
I think we had a damn good season.

468
01:06:34,975 --> 01:06:37,228
For the first time, we've won
the respect of the Europeans.

469
01:06:37,478 --> 01:06:39,188
You're damn right.
We've got two top racers.

470
01:06:39,313 --> 01:06:40,731
Either one of them could win the Olympics.

471
01:06:40,981 --> 01:06:44,276
When I stop saying it and start thinking it,
then we're all in a lot of trouble.

472
01:06:44,402 --> 01:06:46,612
Look, we can't take a team to Europe
and expect them to compete

473
01:06:46,737 --> 01:06:49,532
against the Meiers and the Boyrivens
by selling lapel buttons.

474
01:06:49,657 --> 01:06:52,702
Okay, okay. You give us the money,

475
01:06:52,827 --> 01:06:57,081
and I guarantee you I'll get you a gold
medal at the Olympics. Maybe two.

476
01:06:57,248 --> 01:07:01,001
If we're going out on a limb
for this kind of a budget, gentlemen,

477
01:07:01,127 --> 01:07:03,712
I propose we set up a watchdog committee.

478
01:07:16,934 --> 01:07:18,102
Well, we've...

479
01:07:18,227 --> 01:07:21,105
We've never been stronger,
I think I can say that.

480
01:07:21,313 --> 01:07:23,983
Oh, we... We've never had as good a team.

481
01:07:24,108 --> 01:07:26,527
I think we might very well
surprise some people.

482
01:07:26,652 --> 01:07:28,863
Do you expect to win
any medals in the Olympics?

483
01:07:28,988 --> 01:07:30,448
Which events?

484
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:33,451
Well, we'd like to win medals, of course.

485
01:07:33,993 --> 01:07:36,871
I don't expect anything.
It's too fragile a sport.

486
01:07:36,996 --> 01:07:39,874
- This is your third season in Europe?
- What do you feel your chances are?

487
01:07:39,999 --> 01:07:43,544
- Do you notice any difference?
- Difference? In the FIS?

488
01:07:43,669 --> 01:07:47,590
Well, hopefully, we will get
in better shape in the first three races,

489
01:07:47,715 --> 01:07:51,302
then go on to take the Olympics.
That's my plan, at least.

490
01:07:51,427 --> 01:07:54,180
- Well, how do you feel about...
- I think our chances are very good.

491
01:07:54,305 --> 01:07:58,184
Well, I used to come to New York,
and I'd have my skis in a case

492
01:07:58,309 --> 01:08:00,811
and my boots, and they'd say,
"What are they?" I'd say, "Skis."

493
01:08:00,936 --> 01:08:02,771
"Skis?" they would say.
"Where are you jumping?"

494
01:08:02,897 --> 01:08:05,524
Now they say, "I saw your picture
in Sports Illustrated."

495
01:08:13,073 --> 01:08:14,491
Hello?

496
01:08:17,912 --> 01:08:20,122
- Hello?
- Hello, David?

497
01:08:20,372 --> 01:08:21,540
Hello.

498
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:25,753
Oh, I'm in Megève.

499
01:08:26,003 --> 01:08:30,549
- I saw you arriving today on television.
- You did? Hey, I've missed you.

500
01:08:31,425 --> 01:08:33,761
- I missed you, too.
- You have?

501
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:39,600
- Are you going to come down here?
- How long are you going to be there?

502
01:08:39,725 --> 01:08:41,977
Till Thursday.
And after that we've got a week off.

503
01:08:42,102 --> 01:08:43,979
- What?
- Till Thursday.

504
01:08:44,104 --> 01:08:46,023
And after that we have a week off.

505
01:08:49,735 --> 01:08:51,070
A whole week?

506
01:08:52,404 --> 01:08:54,573
There's a lot of snow here.

507
01:08:56,283 --> 01:09:00,287
- If you're coming down, I could stay on.
- I will try to, David.

508
01:09:33,821 --> 01:09:35,823
- Thirty-three.
- Yes, sir.

509
01:09:37,991 --> 01:09:39,993
Miss Stahl called twice.

510
01:09:42,538 --> 01:09:43,831
Where's...

511
01:10:13,444 --> 01:10:16,780
Hello, Mr Chappellet.
Nice to see you again. How are you?

512
01:10:16,905 --> 01:10:20,951
- Welcome to Zurich.
- Carole isn't here, then?

513
01:10:21,201 --> 01:10:24,496
No, she went home for Christmas.
She will be heartbroken.

514
01:10:24,746 --> 01:10:26,039
Come on, sit down.

515
01:10:27,875 --> 01:10:29,960
Tell me, did you ever try my skis?

516
01:10:30,085 --> 01:10:32,212
Yeah, I was practising on them last week.

517
01:10:32,337 --> 01:10:36,258
They're fine. They are a little stiff
for me, but they are okay, though.

518
01:10:37,342 --> 01:10:39,261
Let me get my designer to come in here.

519
01:10:39,386 --> 01:10:41,263
I'd like him to hear
exactly what you think.

520
01:10:41,388 --> 01:10:43,056
Perhaps it could be remedied.

521
01:10:43,182 --> 01:10:44,641
- Do you know when she will be back?
- Pardon?

522
01:10:44,766 --> 01:10:46,977
Do you know when she'll be back?

523
01:10:47,102 --> 01:10:49,480
Why, after Christmas.

524
01:10:54,985 --> 01:10:57,321
- Are you alone in Zurich?
- Yeah.

525
01:10:59,072 --> 01:11:00,824
You'll have lunch with me, huh?

526
01:11:00,949 --> 01:11:03,410
No, no, I just stopped by to say hello.
Would you tell her that...

527
01:11:03,535 --> 01:11:05,662
Yes, of course I will. But now lunch.

528
01:11:06,079 --> 01:11:10,417
About the skis, you know, you say they...
They were too stiff.

529
01:11:10,751 --> 01:11:15,631
Actually, we have tried that stiffness, and
we find it gives you much more stability,

530
01:11:15,756 --> 01:11:16,924
especially for the downhill.

531
01:12:08,725 --> 01:12:11,353
Oh, one night I was supposed
to go out to a dance.

532
01:12:11,478 --> 01:12:12,771
This was the youngest chick I could find.

533
01:12:25,951 --> 01:12:27,244
David!

534
01:12:42,676 --> 01:12:45,512
Hello! What a surprise.

535
01:12:46,179 --> 01:12:47,973
Yeah, I guess it is.

536
01:12:49,725 --> 01:12:51,268
I waited for you in Megève.

537
01:12:51,393 --> 01:12:54,938
But why, David? You knew
I had plans for Christmas, didn't you?

538
01:12:55,063 --> 01:12:57,691
No, you didn't tell me that.
If I had known, I wouldn't have waited.

539
01:12:57,816 --> 01:13:00,068
But I had to go home.
Every year it's the same thing.

540
01:13:00,193 --> 01:13:01,695
Everybody was there.

541
01:13:02,362 --> 01:13:04,406
- I didn't know.
- Oh, yeah?

542
01:13:11,997 --> 01:13:15,167
I got a present for you. It's in the car.

543
01:13:51,369 --> 01:13:52,746
Here.

544
01:13:53,038 --> 01:13:56,750
- How long have you been in Wengen?
- One week. I'm here for holidays.

545
01:14:00,295 --> 01:14:02,923
Did Machet tell you I came by the office?

546
01:14:03,048 --> 01:14:04,591
Oh, yes.

547
01:14:05,258 --> 01:14:08,470
You know, he's really counting
on you for the Olympics, David.

548
01:14:10,639 --> 01:14:12,432
Yeah, me and a few others.

549
01:14:12,557 --> 01:14:16,269
Oh, no, he really feels
you have a good chance.

550
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:20,232
Aren't you going to open it?

551
01:14:31,701 --> 01:14:34,287
- You like them?
- Yeah, they're great.

552
01:14:34,871 --> 01:14:37,415
You know, I had such
a terrific Christmas this year.

553
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:39,125
My brother was Santa Claus.

554
01:14:39,251 --> 01:14:41,628
We had so many presents
because everybody bought

555
01:14:41,753 --> 01:14:43,797
funny presents to one another.

556
01:14:43,922 --> 01:14:45,131
It was great.
We didn't have too much snow,

557
01:14:45,257 --> 01:14:48,718
but, really, it doesn't matter because
we put cotton in between the windows

558
01:14:48,843 --> 01:14:52,180
to make it look like it had been snowing
a lot outside and it was really great.

559
01:14:52,305 --> 01:14:54,099
We had a fabulous Christmas party...

560
01:15:35,724 --> 01:15:38,768
Okay, that's it for today. Let's wrap it up.

561
01:15:44,232 --> 01:15:45,650
Okay.

562
01:15:46,735 --> 01:15:49,863
Whatever you can handle, all right?
Don't...

563
01:15:50,321 --> 01:15:52,073
Beat you to the bottom.

564
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,879
Hey, what the hell is that?

565
01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:08,381
Hey!

566
01:17:43,393 --> 01:17:44,602
I'll see you.

567
01:18:05,039 --> 01:18:06,833
D.K., make yourself scarce, would you?

568
01:18:06,958 --> 01:18:09,711
Yeah. See you later.

569
01:18:19,554 --> 01:18:21,347
That was quite a stunt you pulled.

570
01:18:23,141 --> 01:18:24,934
It was a real gem.

571
01:18:27,895 --> 01:18:32,775
Seven years. You know, in seven years
I have never had a hot dog like you.

572
01:18:35,153 --> 01:18:38,865
You take my best racer and pile him
into a stone wall just for the fun of it.

573
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:41,034
I didn't pile him into anything.

574
01:18:41,534 --> 01:18:44,954
- Creech can look out for himself.
- You'd take a chance like that?

575
01:18:45,079 --> 01:18:49,500
The day before the Lauberhorn?
Two weeks before the Olympics?

576
01:18:51,169 --> 01:18:52,837
No thought, Chappellet.

577
01:18:52,962 --> 01:18:55,840
- He didn't have to race, did he?
- No, he didn't.

578
01:18:56,132 --> 01:18:58,092
- I thought he knew better.
- Did you speak to him already?

579
01:18:58,217 --> 01:18:59,552
- Him?
- Creech.

580
01:18:59,677 --> 01:19:00,928
- No. No, I haven't.
- Are you going to?

581
01:19:01,054 --> 01:19:02,930
Don't you worry about
what I'm going to say to Creech.

582
01:19:03,056 --> 01:19:05,058
I'm going to tell him
just exactly what I'm saying to you.

583
01:19:05,183 --> 01:19:06,517
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

584
01:19:06,642 --> 01:19:08,144
Besides, he knows.

585
01:19:08,269 --> 01:19:10,229
He knows what he did. He knows how I feel.

586
01:19:10,354 --> 01:19:12,065
Well, what did he do?

587
01:19:12,190 --> 01:19:14,650
He bailed out on a course he'd been
running every year for five years.

588
01:19:14,776 --> 01:19:16,986
So he fell over.
He can do that any time he races.

589
01:19:17,111 --> 01:19:19,447
Nobody races unless I say so.

590
01:19:21,157 --> 01:19:25,036
That's why I'm here.
That's why they made me the coach.

591
01:19:28,581 --> 01:19:31,542
They did not send me over here
for the fun of it, Chappellet.

592
01:19:31,667 --> 01:19:34,879
You know, it costs lots of money.
A lot of money.

593
01:19:36,714 --> 01:19:40,635
That's why we have to train as a team.
That's why we have to race as a team.

594
01:19:42,261 --> 01:19:44,847
We have to have a team, Chappellet.
A winning team.

595
01:19:44,972 --> 01:19:46,349
And whether you like it or not,

596
01:19:46,474 --> 01:19:49,685
I'm just as much a part
of that team as you are.

597
01:19:50,394 --> 01:19:53,481
That's why they sent us here.
Some very important people.

598
01:19:53,606 --> 01:19:56,609
The same people that bought you that
ticket to get you out of Idaho Springs.

599
01:19:56,734 --> 01:19:57,819
What do they know about skiing?

600
01:19:57,944 --> 01:20:00,404
The same people that's been
supporting you for the last three years.

601
01:20:00,530 --> 01:20:01,614
People like me.

602
01:20:01,739 --> 01:20:04,200
There's a whole world out there
that you know nothing about...

603
01:20:04,325 --> 01:20:07,411
Well, you can't understand that, can you?

604
01:20:07,537 --> 01:20:08,621
What's there to understand?

605
01:20:08,746 --> 01:20:11,874
I'm here because I ski and I ski fast.
That's all there is to it.

606
01:20:11,999 --> 01:20:14,836
That is it, huh? Yeah, you ski fast.

607
01:20:16,337 --> 01:20:20,132
You race, but you're reckless.

608
01:20:20,842 --> 01:20:22,510
You rack up a lot.

609
01:20:23,010 --> 01:20:24,929
No consistency. That's what Creech has.

610
01:20:25,054 --> 01:20:27,848
- It doesn't win a medal.
- It counts for a lot.

611
01:20:28,683 --> 01:20:31,435
It comes from a certain
consideration for the sport.

612
01:20:31,561 --> 01:20:35,064
A desire to learn.
That's something you never had.

613
01:20:37,316 --> 01:20:40,194
You never had any real education, did you?

614
01:20:46,867 --> 01:20:49,203
All you ever had was your skis.

615
01:20:50,246 --> 01:20:52,331
And that's not enough.

616
01:21:07,805 --> 01:21:10,641
Wengen is so remote
that it doesn't get as big crowds

617
01:21:10,766 --> 01:21:12,435
as the Hahnenkamm or the Kandahar.

618
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:15,855
But there's more than ordinary interest
centred in the Lauberhorn this year

619
01:21:15,980 --> 01:21:19,150
because it falls two weeks
before the Winter Olympics.

620
01:21:19,275 --> 01:21:21,652
So it becomes
a very tough dress rehearsal.

621
01:21:21,777 --> 01:21:24,447
The results here are bound
to have a significant effect

622
01:21:24,572 --> 01:21:25,698
on the Games themselves.

623
01:21:25,823 --> 01:21:28,284
There's Johnny Creech.
He is in the gate now.

624
01:21:28,409 --> 01:21:31,787
You know, doing well today will certainly
give him confidence at the Olympics.

625
01:22:24,548 --> 01:22:26,133
My leg. My leg.

626
01:22:32,139 --> 01:22:33,557
Creech has fallen.

627
01:23:02,294 --> 01:23:05,965
I hear it's not too bad.
About 50 pieces is all.

628
01:23:09,426 --> 01:23:11,011
Yeah, not too bad.

629
01:23:13,973 --> 01:23:17,726
- You'll get them next year.
- You mean four years from now?

630
01:23:43,961 --> 01:23:45,004
I sure...

631
01:23:50,175 --> 01:23:51,552
I sure wish...

632
01:24:10,571 --> 01:24:11,947
How is it?

633
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:23,626
Isn't it

634
01:24:25,002 --> 01:24:26,462
stupid?

635
01:24:29,965 --> 01:24:32,009
I was telling Dave about

636
01:24:35,596 --> 01:24:38,515
how we used to talk
about justice of sport.

637
01:24:40,768 --> 01:24:43,520
The justice of sport, yes.

638
01:24:45,773 --> 01:24:47,858
The sacrifice without end.

639
01:25:27,022 --> 01:25:28,774
Well, what do you think your chances are?

640
01:25:28,899 --> 01:25:32,444
I don't know. I don't know.
At the moment, I...

641
01:25:33,904 --> 01:25:36,365
- Do you feel physically fit for the race?
- Yeah, I feel good.

642
01:25:46,208 --> 01:25:48,168
Well, this is it. How do you feel?

643
01:25:50,462 --> 01:25:51,713
This is it.

644
01:25:51,839 --> 01:25:54,550
What are your plans after the Olympics?

645
01:25:56,593 --> 01:25:57,970
This is it.

646
01:28:48,557 --> 01:28:50,976
The long section on top is grippy snow.

647
01:28:53,186 --> 01:28:55,480
It's not blowing on top any more.

648
01:28:57,232 --> 01:28:59,025
It's all blown away.

649
01:29:06,825 --> 01:29:08,869
It's very well,
the conditions are really good today.

650
01:29:08,994 --> 01:29:10,120
Yes, the course is fine.

651
01:29:14,124 --> 01:29:15,709
Will your wife be watching the race today?

652
01:29:15,834 --> 01:29:17,377
Sure, she will be there. All right.

653
01:29:21,548 --> 01:29:24,634
Were you holding anything back
in the non-stop yesterday?

654
01:29:24,759 --> 01:29:27,304
- Have you seen Johnny Creech?
- Yeah.

655
01:30:00,629 --> 01:30:04,257
We are just a few moments now, ladies and
gentlemen, from the start of the downhill.

656
01:30:04,382 --> 01:30:06,968
And this is the event in alpine skiing.

657
01:30:07,093 --> 01:30:09,971
You can see the size of the crowd
already gathered.

658
01:30:10,096 --> 01:30:13,642
At the gate, you see the great Austrian
racer, Max Meier, number five.

659
01:30:13,767 --> 01:30:17,228
There is Istel, number 13.
Others are still arriving.

660
01:30:52,931 --> 01:30:55,975
And now into the gate,
Boyriven of France, number three.

661
01:31:06,111 --> 01:31:07,237
Okay.

662
01:31:39,811 --> 01:31:42,272
- Alec!
- Right.

663
01:31:42,814 --> 01:31:44,482
Boyriven is down.

664
01:31:45,775 --> 01:31:46,901
Right.

665
01:31:48,862 --> 01:31:51,364
Max Meier, the Austrian
who's probably won more races

666
01:31:51,489 --> 01:31:54,242
than any man in history,
but never yet an Olympic gold medal.

667
01:31:54,367 --> 01:31:55,493
He's off!

668
01:32:17,765 --> 01:32:19,225
Here he comes around the hairpin.

669
01:32:19,350 --> 01:32:22,562
Looks a little icy here. Look at this.
He is skiing a fantastic race!

670
01:32:45,376 --> 01:32:47,795
Now here's Meier.
He has to break 2:21. He did it!

671
01:32:47,921 --> 01:32:50,298
Max Meier of Austria with 2:20.91.

672
01:32:50,423 --> 01:32:52,300
And a really great chance
for the gold medal.

673
01:33:09,609 --> 01:33:12,028
Sure, I had some trouble.
In the bumps, you know.

674
01:33:12,153 --> 01:33:13,196
So I don't... You know.

675
01:33:13,321 --> 01:33:15,531
You don't do well,
especially when you can't see a thing.

676
01:33:15,907 --> 01:33:17,450
This is Hinsch.

677
01:33:48,731 --> 01:33:50,566
- Very icy here by the farmhouse.
- Right.

678
01:33:50,692 --> 01:33:52,235
Meier almost went down.

679
01:33:55,530 --> 01:33:58,032
Alec says the course
is holding up pretty good.

680
01:33:58,157 --> 01:34:00,535
Except by the farmhouse,
the last three turns.

681
01:34:00,702 --> 01:34:03,162
It's a little slippery, but it's not too bad.

682
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:06,958
- Who's ahead?
- Meier.

683
01:34:13,423 --> 01:34:16,175
Chappellet, you can win.

684
01:34:20,972 --> 01:34:24,726
And now here comes the French
second great hope, François Istel.

685
01:34:24,851 --> 01:34:25,935
Can he beat Meier?

686
01:34:48,875 --> 01:34:50,626
Here comes Istel. He'll have a good time.

687
01:34:50,751 --> 01:34:53,379
Not good enough to beat Meier,
but could give France the silver medal.

688
01:34:53,504 --> 01:34:56,215
Here it is, 2:21.56.

689
01:35:34,712 --> 01:35:37,340
We are almost ready up here.
He is in the gate now.

690
01:35:55,983 --> 01:35:58,569
Here is the great American racer
from Idaho Springs, Colorado.

691
01:35:58,694 --> 01:35:59,737
Can he beat Meier's...

692
01:36:38,067 --> 01:36:39,402
Can you hear me? 1:09.

693
01:36:39,527 --> 01:36:43,239
His interval time is the fastest time yet.
I have it at 1.08.5.

694
01:36:48,494 --> 01:36:51,539
Exceptionally fast race. He's taking
the high line and he's holding it.

695
01:36:51,664 --> 01:36:52,790
He's really going fast.

696
01:36:52,915 --> 01:36:55,209
He's coming to the shambles now.
He has 2:20.91 to beat.

697
01:36:55,334 --> 01:36:56,460
That's 2:20.91.

698
01:36:56,585 --> 01:36:58,921
There is no doubt about it,
Chappellet's really going all out.

699
01:36:59,046 --> 01:37:01,173
Can he beat him? Can he beat Meier?

700
01:37:06,053 --> 01:37:08,931
Here he comes.
It is going to be very close.

701
01:37:14,854 --> 01:37:18,441
2. 17, 2. 18, 2. 19, 2.20.

702
01:37:18,566 --> 01:37:21,277
He beat him!

703
01:37:43,591 --> 01:37:45,593
What do you think of that, huh?
What do you think of that, huh?

704
01:37:45,718 --> 01:37:47,428
...to be the first American man
who ever won a gold medal?

705
01:37:47,553 --> 01:37:48,679
- Good.
- Yes.

706
01:37:48,804 --> 01:37:50,973
He did great. Just great!

707
01:37:53,058 --> 01:37:54,810
That's it! That's great!

708
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:21,754
How was the course?
Did you have any trouble?

709
01:38:21,879 --> 01:38:23,464
It's a good course. The main course...

710
01:38:23,589 --> 01:38:26,175
Yes, we have. We're definitely in there.

711
01:38:31,055 --> 01:38:32,681
We are at the top!

712
01:38:34,558 --> 01:38:36,977
- I had great confidence in him all along.
- What are your plans now?

713
01:38:37,102 --> 01:38:39,438
What? Pardon, what?

714
01:38:39,563 --> 01:38:43,234
I'll go back to the States
and I don't know, just take a rest.

715
01:38:48,989 --> 01:38:50,741
By the time I crossed the finish...

716
01:38:52,993 --> 01:38:56,288
No, I didn't know Meier's time.
I just knew he was ahead.

717
01:38:57,081 --> 01:38:59,166
- The time 1:08, is that what they said?
- Yes, they did.

718
01:38:59,291 --> 01:39:01,710
...wouldn't do much
thinking about it before.

719
01:39:01,835 --> 01:39:03,796
I was just thinking about getting down.

720
01:39:05,839 --> 01:39:07,383
I knew we'd win.

721
01:39:07,508 --> 01:39:09,760
- You didn't expect come up here.
- We waited so long for it to happen.

722
01:39:11,178 --> 01:39:13,764
I was just thinking about getting down
as fast as I could.

723
01:39:13,889 --> 01:39:17,309
You know, he just let me go.
Said it's up to me.

724
01:39:17,434 --> 01:39:19,478
Do you feel it's one
of your strongest races?

725
01:39:25,859 --> 01:39:28,028
I don't know.
I mean, I slowed down a little.

726
01:39:28,153 --> 01:39:30,155
Hey, the German's got a good time.

727
01:39:31,198 --> 01:39:33,075
We have a good time coming up.

728
01:39:33,701 --> 01:39:36,203
The German's got the best time
at the halfway sign.

729
01:39:36,328 --> 01:39:39,039
He had the best time at the half,
the German, didn't he?

730
01:40:17,202 --> 01:40:19,830
- You've got a gold medal!
- You got a gold medal, huh?

731
01:40:22,207 --> 01:40:25,210
Hey! That was... Great! Great!

732
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:31,675
Very fast race, very fast.

733
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:33,677
Did you think Chappellet would beat Meier?

734
01:40:33,802 --> 01:40:35,095
Yes.

735
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:36,472
What are your plans now?

736
01:40:36,597 --> 01:40:40,976
Oh, we're just going to go back
to States and take a good rest.

737
01:40:42,519 --> 01:40:44,646
No, no... We were ready for it. No.

738
01:40:46,648 --> 01:40:48,817
Meier. Yeah, Meier.

739
01:40:49,693 --> 01:40:50,861
What?

740
01:40:52,738 --> 01:40:54,114
We trained hard.

741
01:40:55,199 --> 01:40:57,367
Yes, it was very fast, awfully fast.

742
01:41:14,218 --> 01:41:15,836
What are your plans now?

743
01:41:15,861 --> 01:41:18,347
- Just to slow down, I guess.
- I don't know, I don't know.
