1
00:00:36,544 --> 00:00:41,379
This man has been brought to me
as one who misleads the people.

2
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,653
He is accused of sedition and blasphemy,
for which he should suffer death.

3
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:04,267
My Lord Governor!

4
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,506
My Lord Governor...

5
00:01:14,682 --> 00:01:18,743
...there is a custom in Jerusalem,
that at this season of the feast...

6
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,482
...one condemned man should be released.

7
00:01:21,589 --> 00:01:23,454
l remember the custom.

8
00:01:23,524 --> 00:01:27,324
Who shall it be?
This man who many of you call their king?

9
00:01:28,196 --> 00:01:30,130
Or shall it be Barabbas?

10
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,994
Release Barabbas!

11
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:39,266
-Release Jesus of Nazareth!
-No, not Barabbas!

12
00:01:44,779 --> 00:01:48,374
-Barabbas!
-Release Barabbas! Crucify the Nazarene!

13
00:01:49,617 --> 00:01:52,711
They"re mad, Lord Governor.
Barabbas is a rebel.

14
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,818
A robber, an assassin.

15
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:58,053
Release Barabbas!

16
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:33,914
Take the Nazarene,
scourge him and bring him here again...

17
00:03:34,288 --> 00:03:35,949
...and he shall be crucified.

18
00:04:26,107 --> 00:04:27,836
All right, that"s enough.

19
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,131
Take him out.

20
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:47,954
Open up.

21
00:05:03,244 --> 00:05:04,404
Come on.

22
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:20,550
One man to be set free.

23
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,661
Set free?

24
00:05:24,832 --> 00:05:27,699
You ought to know the custom
of the season.

25
00:05:27,768 --> 00:05:30,396
The Governor offered them
either the prophet or you.

26
00:05:31,005 --> 00:05:33,269
He listened to the voices
and they chose you.

27
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:38,368
l make no comment.
Come on. Get on the move.

28
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,911
All right.

29
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,092
Give us a hair of your beard.

30
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:02,962
lt ought to be lucky,
considering how things have gone for you.

31
00:06:10,878 --> 00:06:14,279
l"m not used to the light. lt plays tricks.

32
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,880
lf l was you, l shouldn"t loiter.

33
00:06:17,952 --> 00:06:21,444
l"d want to see the back of this place
before they change their minds.

34
00:06:22,623 --> 00:06:24,090
Get on your way, will you?

35
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,992
-Who do you think you"re shoving?
-Get going.

36
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,960
All right. l"m going.

37
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,571
Move on.

38
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:10,328
-There he is. Release the Nazarene!
-Get out of the way.

39
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:15,033
What are you standing for, like an idiot?
What are you all hanging around for?

40
00:07:58,552 --> 00:08:01,646
Here"s a fine sight.
Six weeks and nobody"s moved.

41
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,688
What"s happened then?
How did you get out?

42
00:08:06,093 --> 00:08:08,027
This is a surprise, let me tell you.

43
00:08:08,095 --> 00:08:09,995
ls that my duck? lt"s him!

44
00:08:10,064 --> 00:08:12,555
-Sara!
-There"s the black knave himself...

45
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,031
...come back to his own.

46
00:08:14,101 --> 00:08:18,504
Cheating his death again, like a good boy.
The clever one. How did you do it?

47
00:08:18,572 --> 00:08:22,838
l was released to celebrate the holiday
as a surprise for you.

48
00:08:23,344 --> 00:08:27,280
Here"s a day to celebrate in all my god.
Come on and tell us the whole story.

49
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,542
You"ve not heard?
l"m the choice of the people.

50
00:08:29,617 --> 00:08:32,552
""Give us Barabbas,"" they said.
Give me some food.

51
00:08:32,686 --> 00:08:35,246
Food for Barabbas. Food for a hungry man.

52
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:38,187
How does it feel?
How did you feel when they told you?

53
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:39,920
The choice of the people, eh?

54
00:08:40,861 --> 00:08:44,922
Old Sara here dropping tears so fast
all the slopping wine got watered.

55
00:08:45,032 --> 00:08:47,762
-Where did you get your luck?
-What witch gave you that?

56
00:08:47,868 --> 00:08:48,960
Pass him across to me!

57
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,801
-Touch him for luck. That"s it.
-l"m not taking chances.

58
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,432
Get away.

59
00:08:57,445 --> 00:08:58,434
Where"s Rachel?

60
00:08:58,546 --> 00:09:00,912
Shut away mourning for me?
Fetch her down here.

61
00:09:00,981 --> 00:09:02,744
She"s no good for you or anyone else.

62
00:09:02,817 --> 00:09:06,947
-She"s completely changed, l"m telling you.
-What"s wrong with her? Bring her down.

63
00:09:07,054 --> 00:09:10,888
She"s no good to my old rascal now.
She thinks of nothing, day or night...

64
00:09:10,991 --> 00:09:14,449
...except this prophet from Nazareth,
who"s on trial for blasphemy.

65
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,788
Ever since she heard him preach,
she has gone off her life...

66
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,957
...like a sick child goes off its food.

67
00:09:20,968 --> 00:09:24,802
Come on, you old empty belly.
There"s no food inside you worth vomiting.

68
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:26,672
Sit down and eat.

69
00:09:27,842 --> 00:09:29,833
Barabbas, that girl"s no good for you.

70
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,606
Take my word for it.
As morbid as a crow in a chimney.

71
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,478
Bewitched by a prophet.
A waste of a handsome girl.

72
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:38,746
And she"s gone to his trial
looking like a widow already.

73
00:09:38,819 --> 00:09:41,913
She knows what happened to her prophet.
That"s the end of him.

74
00:09:42,022 --> 00:09:43,990
-Condemned, was he?
-That"s just it.

75
00:09:44,091 --> 00:09:48,084
They had the choice between him and me,
and they chose me. How do you like that?

76
00:09:48,295 --> 00:09:50,786
The idol of the city.

77
00:09:51,332 --> 00:09:54,267
Tell you what.
You"re as good as a king, Barabbas.

78
00:09:54,335 --> 00:09:57,668
They call the prophet King of the Jews,
but they chose you.

79
00:09:57,771 --> 00:09:59,602
Show your respects to King Barabbas.

80
00:09:59,673 --> 00:10:02,198
-Let"s have a crowning of him.
-Yes!

81
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:10,439
-The wicked old King of Judea.
-What are you doing?

82
00:10:19,527 --> 00:10:24,464
-Come on, give him his robes.
-You be nice to your King Barabbas.

83
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:31,335
More wives than Solomon
and his subjects as ripe as old pumpkins.

84
00:10:31,472 --> 00:10:33,565
Here"s your scepter. Take it.

85
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:35,539
Set him on his throne.

86
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,743
-What"s that?
-That"s the scepter.

87
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:40,637
Sit down on your throne.

88
00:10:40,714 --> 00:10:44,844
Kneel down, all you miserable scum
of the earth, and acknowledge.

89
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:47,019
Kneel down, you scum of the earth.

90
00:10:47,087 --> 00:10:48,816
Hail! Hail!

91
00:10:49,056 --> 00:10:52,548
l"ll make laws for you
that will tax your constitutions.

92
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,654
l crown you, King Barabbas.

93
00:11:07,107 --> 00:11:09,371
What are you treating me like a clown for?

94
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,839
Here she is, Barabbas, if you want her.

95
00:11:17,117 --> 00:11:20,245
Look here, Rachel,
look who"s been asking for you.

96
00:11:20,354 --> 00:11:22,288
The old rascal back from the dead.

97
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,786
So, here she is.

98
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:32,187
What"s the matter with me?
Why don"t you look at me?

99
00:11:32,933 --> 00:11:34,264
Barabbas, let me go.

100
00:11:34,368 --> 00:11:36,700
Not until you"ve told me
you"re glad l"m alive.

101
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:40,570
-l wouldn"t wish any man his death.
-What do you mean by that?

102
00:11:40,641 --> 00:11:42,768
Don"t make me speak to you.

103
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,906
-What do you mean by that?
-Don"t make me speak to you.

104
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,743
That"s a warm welcome.

105
00:11:48,616 --> 00:11:50,277
l couldn"t follow any further.

106
00:11:50,384 --> 00:11:53,945
l daren"t say what is still to come,
but God forgive us all if he can.

107
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,986
What did l tell you?
She"s no good to you now, Barabbas.

108
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,582
Come on.

109
00:12:14,808 --> 00:12:17,299
l"m not here to be made a fool of.

110
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:20,242
What"s the matter?

111
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,086
Remember how it used to be.

112
00:12:26,153 --> 00:12:30,453
Barabbas, don"t you see what"s happening?
Don"t you understand what set you free?

113
00:12:31,191 --> 00:12:33,125
l just got out of prison.

114
00:12:34,762 --> 00:12:38,027
l need to get the cramp out of my bones.
That"s what"s happened.

115
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:46,800
-l"m not the same. Nothing is the same.
-You"d better try and make it the same.

116
00:12:47,841 --> 00:12:50,935
Barabbas, listen to me.
For pity"s sake believe me.

117
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,714
He came from God,
the man who"s taking your place.

118
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:58,177
You think l should have been killed
instead of him?

119
00:12:58,352 --> 00:13:00,013
You think l ought to be dead?

120
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,112
Barabbas, hear what l say.
He came from God.

121
00:13:04,525 --> 00:13:07,961
That"s none of my worry.
God can look after his own.

122
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:09,723
-And you can look after me.
-No!

123
00:13:10,497 --> 00:13:13,694
That girl up there was always coming back
with strange ideas.

124
00:13:13,801 --> 00:13:15,666
She"s got her head full of them.

125
00:13:15,736 --> 00:13:19,729
Well, it seems she"s got something
to think about now, anyway.

126
00:13:20,641 --> 00:13:24,133
-l don"t like the look of it.
-Look of what? What"s the matter?

127
00:13:24,211 --> 00:13:26,202
The sky. The light"s gone out of it.

128
00:13:42,062 --> 00:13:45,361
l"ve never known it dark like this
in the middle of the day.

129
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,396
Get a light, for mercy"s sake.

130
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,974
Something"s wrong with my eyes.

131
00:15:09,817 --> 00:15:11,250
l can"t see.

132
00:15:15,756 --> 00:15:17,018
Something"s wrong.

133
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,793
Everything"s black.

134
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,622
Black as death.

135
00:15:25,432 --> 00:15:28,128
l knew there was something wrong
when l saw that light.

136
00:15:28,936 --> 00:15:31,029
Tell me. Am l going blind?

137
00:15:31,338 --> 00:15:33,135
Am l going blind?

138
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,449
What"s happening?

139
00:15:51,024 --> 00:15:52,548
You know what has happened.

140
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:56,220
Even the light has left us,
now that we"ve killed him.

141
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,258
Well, are you satisfied now?

142
00:19:49,096 --> 00:19:52,031
He"s dead.
Just the same as any other man.

143
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,067
-We"ve seen it. That"s the end of it.
-He promised to come back.

144
00:19:57,137 --> 00:19:58,627
We shall see that, too.

145
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,299
Only two days
and he"ll be in the world again.

146
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,808
Look at his friends.
You think they believe it?

147
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,435
l tell you, you"re mad. That"s the end of it.

148
00:20:06,546 --> 00:20:09,140
Not tomorrow, but the morning after.

149
00:20:47,988 --> 00:20:49,819
How many days have l been here?

150
00:21:10,777 --> 00:21:12,472
How many days have l been here?

151
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,049
Can"t you hear me?

152
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,710
What"s the matter with you?

153
00:21:21,054 --> 00:21:23,488
What"s the matter? Two days.

154
00:21:25,058 --> 00:21:26,389
Two days.

155
00:21:35,068 --> 00:21:37,366
Then today"s the third day?

156
00:21:37,971 --> 00:21:41,031
Two and one make three. What"s so odd?

157
00:21:42,008 --> 00:21:43,305
We"ll see, then.

158
00:21:44,744 --> 00:21:47,474
This is the morning of the third day.

159
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,382
Barabbas, where are you going?

160
00:22:55,282 --> 00:22:56,749
Now you know it"s true.

161
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,384
All l know is the tomb is empty.

162
00:23:03,056 --> 00:23:05,217
-Who moved the stone?
-God moved it.

163
00:23:10,063 --> 00:23:12,497
God himself? You saw him do it?

164
00:23:13,566 --> 00:23:15,295
A power came from the sky.

165
00:23:15,402 --> 00:23:18,428
lt was when the sun was rising,
at the beginning of the day.

166
00:23:18,505 --> 00:23:20,666
-First there was the music of a horn.
-Horn?

167
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,605
Then in the air there was an angel.

168
00:23:23,243 --> 00:23:25,177
The whole sky seemed to dismantle.

169
00:23:25,812 --> 00:23:29,248
lt was white, it was fire.

170
00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:31,310
lt was white fire.

171
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:35,118
He stretched out his arm.
lt seemed as long as a spear.

172
00:23:35,188 --> 00:23:38,680
The point of the spear
went between the stone and the rock...

173
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,487
...and the stone rolled away.

174
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:45,787
lf only you had been here sooner
and seen what l saw.

175
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:49,192
My eyes are good.
They see nothing but real things.

176
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:51,327
You have to believe this, Barabbas.

177
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:55,434
The Master was a man of truth,
and he said this would be so.

178
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:58,275
Did you see a prophet come
out of the tomb?

179
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,503
My eyes were so dazzled.

180
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,305
l think l must have covered them.

181
00:24:04,517 --> 00:24:06,212
But when l could see again...

182
00:24:06,386 --> 00:24:10,117
...a man and a woman were together
in the garden. Then the woman was alone.

183
00:24:10,223 --> 00:24:12,623
And then she went quickly away.

184
00:24:12,892 --> 00:24:15,383
And the man was the same man
they buried in there?

185
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,555
He was like a shadow.

186
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:22,465
The morning light was behind him.
But l"m sure it was he.

187
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,968
Shadows, light, that"s about the truth of it.

188
00:24:26,306 --> 00:24:27,705
Here"s the truth of it:

189
00:24:28,408 --> 00:24:30,808
Why do you think he should lie
about himself...

190
00:24:30,877 --> 00:24:32,742
...when it meant he would be killed?

191
00:24:33,747 --> 00:24:35,374
How do you know what he said?

192
00:24:35,482 --> 00:24:38,974
The priests ought to know more
than you do. And they call it blasphemy.

193
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,514
He said:

194
00:24:42,756 --> 00:24:44,018
""Love one another.""

195
00:24:45,992 --> 00:24:47,584
""Love one another""?

196
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,929
And they crucified him for that?

197
00:24:52,432 --> 00:24:54,263
Where are you going?

198
00:24:56,569 --> 00:24:58,594
There are those who can tell you more.

199
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:01,674
There"s a house in the street of the potters
where they meet.

200
00:25:01,741 --> 00:25:04,175
You may find them there.
Go and ask them.

201
00:25:04,244 --> 00:25:05,836
lt"s a trick they"re playing.

202
00:25:05,912 --> 00:25:08,710
They took the body and hid it
to go on with their story.

203
00:25:08,782 --> 00:25:10,249
Or are you afraid?

204
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,580
Are you afraid of knowing
what has happened?

205
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:44,913
Are you looking for someone?

206
00:25:47,053 --> 00:25:48,486
You like to see it?

207
00:25:49,823 --> 00:25:51,450
The clay making itself?

208
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,257
Some other day.

209
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,121
What"s happened? l heard there was news.

210
00:25:59,232 --> 00:26:01,598
The tomb"s empty,
the women said they saw him.

211
00:26:01,668 --> 00:26:05,468
Creed can have strange visions.
Only it"s true. Where"s Peter?

212
00:26:37,837 --> 00:26:39,498
Who could it be?

213
00:26:40,006 --> 00:26:41,473
Don"t open it.

214
00:26:41,541 --> 00:26:45,170
We should get out of this city.
Wiser to go down to Galilee.

215
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:49,510
Can we hide from the future forever?
Let"s see what is here.

216
00:26:49,616 --> 00:26:51,345
What if they mean to destroy us all?

217
00:26:51,451 --> 00:26:53,783
Leaving no one to tell the knowledge
of the man.

218
00:26:53,853 --> 00:26:57,220
Can the word turn to silence?
l"m not afraid of that.

219
00:27:02,562 --> 00:27:03,961
Where is he?

220
00:27:05,632 --> 00:27:08,658
-What have you done with him?
-What do you want with us?

221
00:27:08,735 --> 00:27:12,569
-The truth. What happened?
-What right have you to be here?

222
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,196
You know what l mean.

223
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,167
What are you all afraid of?

224
00:27:20,813 --> 00:27:22,713
What are we afraid of?

225
00:27:25,051 --> 00:27:27,417
You want to know what we want to know.

226
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,011
-What is the truth of this morning?
-l know the truth.

227
00:27:31,357 --> 00:27:32,756
You stole the body.

228
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:36,026
You think we might have hidden it
here among us.

229
00:27:36,095 --> 00:27:38,529
But something else has happened.

230
00:27:38,665 --> 00:27:42,328
lf you find him here,
it will only be if he comes himself.

231
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:45,667
Through that gate, as you did just now.

232
00:27:47,006 --> 00:27:50,942
Don"t you believe it. l saw the body.
He was a dead man.

233
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,569
lf you were sure of that,
you wouldn"t be here.

234
00:27:54,113 --> 00:27:55,102
He"s risen.

235
00:27:56,282 --> 00:27:58,773
l trust in him and wait.

236
00:28:05,024 --> 00:28:06,582
You"re all mad.

237
00:28:09,963 --> 00:28:12,625
What do you think you"re doing,
making that net?

238
00:28:12,966 --> 00:28:15,526
There"s no sea to fish in
closer than Galilee.

239
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:18,431
lt"s what l"m used to doing,
my hands go to it.

240
00:28:18,605 --> 00:28:21,938
But the streets in the cities
have to be the sea for me now.

241
00:28:22,408 --> 00:28:25,400
He made a joke about it
when he took us away from the boats.

242
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:29,806
He said that in the future
our fish would be men.

243
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:33,984
lt was a serious joke.

244
00:28:34,621 --> 00:28:38,421
lt meant he"d given us the word
to draw men out of the dark sea...

245
00:28:39,058 --> 00:28:40,218
...into the light.

246
00:28:40,293 --> 00:28:42,784
And you call yourself a fisherman?

247
00:28:42,895 --> 00:28:45,227
Do l have to tell you
what happens to the fish?

248
00:28:45,298 --> 00:28:47,994
They struggle about, gasp and die.

249
00:28:48,968 --> 00:28:52,665
We struggle and gasp.
You said something good.

250
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:58,307
Poor fish.

251
00:28:59,979 --> 00:29:01,071
l, too...

252
00:29:02,415 --> 00:29:03,939
...must struggle and gasp.

253
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,515
And die.

254
00:29:08,254 --> 00:29:10,313
And die in order to live.

255
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:14,790
That"s where men have the advantage
over fish.

256
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:18,996
They can die to the world,
die to the dark sea...

257
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,767
...and begin to live again in the light.

258
00:29:21,834 --> 00:29:25,600
That"s what he promised,
and what he promised has happened.

259
00:29:26,372 --> 00:29:28,033
But what has happened...

260
00:29:29,542 --> 00:29:31,339
...we still don"t know.

261
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,605
He"s come back to life.

262
00:29:34,347 --> 00:29:37,874
-He"ll lead us to the new kingdom.
-l"ll believe it when he"s before us.

263
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:40,179
When l can touch him and hear him.

264
00:29:40,286 --> 00:29:42,618
You"re always full of doubts
without any cause.

265
00:29:42,689 --> 00:29:45,556
No cause to doubt
that a dead man can come back to life?

266
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:46,682
No cause.

267
00:29:47,727 --> 00:29:50,321
l can take you now to talk with a man
who was dead.

268
00:29:50,563 --> 00:29:53,498
The Master brought him back to life.
Thomas knows him well.

269
00:29:54,867 --> 00:29:56,300
Come, talk to him.

270
00:29:56,703 --> 00:29:57,863
Let him tell you.

271
00:29:59,972 --> 00:30:01,371
You needn"t be afraid.

272
00:30:24,831 --> 00:30:27,425
Lazarus? Will you come to us?

273
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:30,169
Here"s someone wants to question you.

274
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,229
Come in.

275
00:30:38,444 --> 00:30:39,843
l"ll leave you with him.

276
00:30:41,447 --> 00:30:43,415
You can ask him whatever you like.

277
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:19,483
They told me death is not....

278
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,050
ls not death.

279
00:31:23,556 --> 00:31:25,547
They brought me here to see...

280
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:28,820
...because you could make me believe it.

281
00:31:31,664 --> 00:31:35,600
Because you were dead,
and were raised from the dead by the man.

282
00:31:36,502 --> 00:31:37,628
l mean...

283
00:31:38,471 --> 00:31:39,563
...the Master.

284
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,435
That is true.

285
00:31:45,077 --> 00:31:46,408
l was dead.

286
00:31:49,916 --> 00:31:51,941
And l know that he is Christ...

287
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:54,082
...the Son of God...

288
00:31:54,987 --> 00:31:57,353
...who has power over life and death.

289
00:31:58,491 --> 00:31:59,822
What"s it like there?

290
00:32:00,626 --> 00:32:02,423
You were there.

291
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,087
-Tell me what it"s like.
-Like?

292
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:09,161
-Like?
-Yes, what is it...

293
00:32:10,269 --> 00:32:12,499
...this thing you experienced?

294
00:32:14,273 --> 00:32:15,365
What is it?

295
00:32:16,609 --> 00:32:18,201
l have experienced nothing.

296
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,170
Only death.

297
00:32:22,548 --> 00:32:24,015
And death is nothing.

298
00:32:25,384 --> 00:32:26,442
Nothing?

299
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,108
No.

300
00:32:29,622 --> 00:32:30,884
What should it be?

301
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:41,029
You want me to tell you
about the realm of the dead?

302
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:42,964
l cannot.

303
00:32:44,971 --> 00:32:47,838
How would you tell an unborn child
what life is?

304
00:32:50,376 --> 00:32:51,673
lt exists.

305
00:32:52,745 --> 00:32:54,212
But it isn"t anything.

306
00:32:56,649 --> 00:32:58,241
To those who"ve been there...

307
00:32:59,719 --> 00:33:02,051
...nothing else is anything either.

308
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,585
No one has asked me this before.

309
00:33:10,696 --> 00:33:14,427
They have listened how life came back
to me and gone away praising.

310
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,667
Only you have asked about death.

311
00:33:18,938 --> 00:33:20,337
And none the wiser.

312
00:33:31,417 --> 00:33:33,248
We"re two men who might be dead.

313
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,615
Sharing his body.

314
00:33:41,627 --> 00:33:42,685
Life.

315
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:08,609
Love one another.

316
00:34:08,955 --> 00:34:12,254
Listen, everybody! That"s the word.
Love one another!

317
00:34:16,629 --> 00:34:19,325
We can tell them about loving one another.

318
00:34:19,465 --> 00:34:24,232
-Leave me alone. l want to sit.
-What do you want to do, sit and think?

319
00:34:24,303 --> 00:34:26,237
lt"s no good thinking.

320
00:34:26,505 --> 00:34:29,906
Come on, let"s go and find a new life.

321
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:43,453
-Where are you going, Barabbas?
-To see what ""brought back to life"" means.

322
00:34:44,924 --> 00:34:46,482
Love one another!

323
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,467
-Come on.
-My shoe.

324
00:35:07,613 --> 00:35:08,637
Look.

325
00:35:32,038 --> 00:35:35,633
-Hey! Get up! Come on!
-Leave it alone.

326
00:36:25,191 --> 00:36:26,419
Stay alive.

327
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,854
lt"s all you have to do.

328
00:36:37,036 --> 00:36:39,436
lt"s not my fault they let him get killed.

329
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,306
You can"t hang it around my neck.

330
00:36:44,143 --> 00:36:46,976
l"ve as much right to be alive
as any of you.

331
00:36:47,213 --> 00:36:49,238
You stinking fish.

332
00:36:49,315 --> 00:36:52,876
You"re afraid to look at me
because l"m alive.

333
00:36:56,222 --> 00:36:58,952
You, look at me. Look at me!

334
00:37:12,004 --> 00:37:14,404
lt may be today that the new world comes.

335
00:37:14,473 --> 00:37:18,603
Today or tomorrow.
But it will come, you will see.

336
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:22,342
Every day you have promised us,
it has never come.

337
00:37:23,082 --> 00:37:26,176
-lt will never come.
-lt will come. l know it.

338
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:29,743
Please, Rachel,
tell us again what it will be like.

339
00:37:29,922 --> 00:37:31,822
You"d better mind what you say.

340
00:37:31,924 --> 00:37:34,688
Don"t you know what can happen to you
if they hear you?

341
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,319
Anybody now caught
spreading such stories...

342
00:37:37,429 --> 00:37:42,162
...the Son of God, the Messiah and such,
is to be judged an enemy of the State...

343
00:37:42,501 --> 00:37:44,662
...and stoned until he"s dead.

344
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:55,038
lt will be as though the Earth has become
like a star burned clean.

345
00:37:55,614 --> 00:37:57,775
Everything evil swept away.

346
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:02,616
We shall look up and there will be angels
coming down from the sky...

347
00:38:03,189 --> 00:38:07,649
...and they will put food in front of us
and perhaps new clothes to wear.

348
00:38:08,194 --> 00:38:13,188
White, like their own.
Or some blue, like the color of the sky.

349
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:22,667
Pain and sorrow will sink into the ground,
and everything will be made new...

350
00:38:23,709 --> 00:38:27,201
...because the Son of God has risen
from the dead.

351
00:38:28,547 --> 00:38:30,412
The world has become his kingdom.

352
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:33,076
There"s no truth in any of it.

353
00:38:34,386 --> 00:38:36,149
l know this woman.

354
00:38:36,422 --> 00:38:39,550
She doesn"t know the difference
between what is real...

355
00:38:41,227 --> 00:38:44,094
...and what she dreamed in her sleep.

356
00:38:44,396 --> 00:38:45,829
Don"t you listen to her.

357
00:38:45,931 --> 00:38:49,059
She"s raking up trouble.
Nothing but trouble.

358
00:38:49,168 --> 00:38:50,328
Trouble for you...

359
00:38:50,402 --> 00:38:53,428
...if you won"t turn and listen to the sounds
that have come.

360
00:38:53,606 --> 00:38:56,268
He knows but is afraid to believe it.

361
00:38:56,609 --> 00:39:00,568
Look at you, Barabbas.
How can you see or hear what"s to come?

362
00:39:00,779 --> 00:39:03,543
lt will happen,
whether you take part in it or not.

363
00:39:03,616 --> 00:39:07,518
He"s right. lt"s dangerous talk.
They"ll pull down our homes, drive us out.

364
00:39:07,586 --> 00:39:09,178
Better listen to this man.

365
00:39:09,255 --> 00:39:12,713
-Let"s hear what the prophet said.
-Don"t leave. Where are you going?

366
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:16,852
To where the lepers are, to tell them
to be ready for the freedom that"s coming.

367
00:39:16,929 --> 00:39:19,625
-She"s going among the lepers!
-Stop her!

368
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,597
She"s going to set the lepers free.

369
00:39:21,767 --> 00:39:25,362
-Don"t let her go among the lepers!
-Don"t let her set the lepers free!

370
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,736
You have no right to go among the lepers!

371
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:36,305
Look out, it"s a temple guard!

372
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,450
We don"t want the lepers to be free!

373
00:39:41,553 --> 00:39:43,885
A charge has been lodged
against this woman.

374
00:39:43,956 --> 00:39:47,949
-She must be questioned.
-We heard she preaches blasphemy.

375
00:39:48,227 --> 00:39:50,491
Bring her to the temple
and we will judge her.

376
00:39:51,563 --> 00:39:55,329
-Take your dirty hands off her.
-Don"t take her! She"s done no wrong.

377
00:39:56,101 --> 00:39:57,568
Don"t take her away.

378
00:40:03,342 --> 00:40:04,934
Rachel!

379
00:40:59,064 --> 00:41:04,127
For blasphemy, and spreading blasphemy,
this woman is condemned.

380
00:41:04,536 --> 00:41:07,004
For stirring up evil matters
among the people...

381
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:11,005
...for misleading their minds
and denying the wisdom of authority.

382
00:41:12,211 --> 00:41:15,874
For her sins, she has been condemned
to death by stoning.

383
00:41:17,182 --> 00:41:21,346
Let the man who accused her
and was found just in his accusation...

384
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,552
...cast the first stone.

385
00:41:29,895 --> 00:41:31,487
What must l do?

386
00:41:32,398 --> 00:41:35,026
Take this stone.
Come on. Throw it at her.

387
00:41:35,267 --> 00:41:36,734
Why should l throw?

388
00:41:37,102 --> 00:41:39,696
-l"ve nothing against her.
-You accused her.

389
00:41:39,772 --> 00:41:42,206
-The law gives you the first stone.
-lt was you.

390
00:41:42,274 --> 00:41:44,435
Or you"ll find yourself there beside her.

391
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:47,205
Throw quickly. lf you wait, l may be afraid.

392
00:43:42,961 --> 00:43:46,556
You don"t have to think of Barabbas
any more. He"s not coming back.

393
00:43:46,798 --> 00:43:49,062
And if he did,
we"d know what to do with him.

394
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:53,528
You"re still afraid of him because
he used to roar at you like a brass bull.

395
00:43:53,639 --> 00:43:56,403
You can"t stand up to him
even when he"s gone.

396
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:58,908
He"s gone to the devil once and for all,
l can tell you.

397
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:00,975
He"s lost his nerve.

398
00:44:01,046 --> 00:44:03,742
He"s creeping about the city
like a shivering priest.

399
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:07,683
Why do you think he"s not come back?
Because he"s afraid to stir hand or foot.

400
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:12,021
-We don"t know yet, he won"t come back.
-Who cares if he does?

401
00:44:12,257 --> 00:44:14,851
We got a man here who can hang him
in his own guts.

402
00:44:14,927 --> 00:44:17,657
He came out of that prison mad.
Acquitted but mad.

403
00:44:17,729 --> 00:44:19,560
We"ll soon see it then.

404
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,795
So, you remembered the way to get here.

405
00:44:57,469 --> 00:44:59,733
Given you up this past week.

406
00:45:02,874 --> 00:45:05,035
You"ll find things altered.

407
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:22,757
What"s over is over.

408
00:45:27,666 --> 00:45:29,293
l remembered the way.

409
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,012
Bring them across.

410
00:46:15,614 --> 00:46:19,015
God"s curse on you! The money is sacred!
lt belongs to the temple!

411
00:46:19,117 --> 00:46:22,177
-The god of battle will destroy you!
-Blasphemy!

412
00:46:22,354 --> 00:46:24,345
You hypocrites. l"ll kill you both.

413
00:46:25,123 --> 00:46:26,385
What are you doing?

414
00:46:26,491 --> 00:46:29,119
Here"s all the treasure we wanted.
Come away!

415
00:46:40,906 --> 00:46:44,364
l"ll kill you the way you had her killed.

416
00:47:00,659 --> 00:47:05,358
lt seemed to me at the time, Barabbas,
when you were given your liberty before...

417
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:07,830
...it wasn"t a fortunate exchange.

418
00:47:08,066 --> 00:47:12,400
They were calling for death and disorder
when they called your name.

419
00:47:12,838 --> 00:47:16,330
This is what l thought
and this is what has occurred.

420
00:47:17,008 --> 00:47:19,374
They put the scourge back into the fist.

421
00:47:20,078 --> 00:47:22,046
By that l mean you and your life.

422
00:47:22,114 --> 00:47:24,708
And many men have suffered
and died in consequence.

423
00:47:24,783 --> 00:47:28,048
The other man, too.
They"re dying because of that.

424
00:47:28,754 --> 00:47:32,019
This is a local matter,
which l hope will soon be adjusted.

425
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:37,351
The shock and fear
of an unreasoning fanaticism will pass.

426
00:47:38,263 --> 00:47:40,231
But the appetite to destroy...

427
00:47:40,465 --> 00:47:44,458
...which, alas, the human being shares
with the wild beast, is always with us.

428
00:47:44,569 --> 00:47:48,471
And it has rigorously to be disciplined
in the name of civilization...

429
00:47:48,573 --> 00:47:51,565
-...and according to the law.
-That"s what you say.

430
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:55,576
But l tell you, whichever side of the law
we"re on, we"re the same men.

431
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:58,081
You and your kind, and me and my kind.

432
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:02,587
How else have you lived except my way?
What we haven"t got, we go out and take.

433
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:06,281
Let him speak.

434
00:48:12,464 --> 00:48:14,955
How else have you lived except my way?

435
00:48:15,834 --> 00:48:19,463
Whoever"s against us or gets in our way,
we get rid of.

436
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,342
My knife may have bitten a few throats,
but what about your weapons?

437
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:28,242
They"ve split thousands upon thousands.

438
00:48:29,848 --> 00:48:32,942
lf l"ve taken a passing woman to myself...

439
00:48:33,418 --> 00:48:36,649
...your armies have looted and raped
across continents.

440
00:48:37,255 --> 00:48:40,122
And have been called
the glory of the earth for doing it.

441
00:48:40,192 --> 00:48:44,492
You were born according to the law
and raised according to the law.

442
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:47,492
l was born by a girl
thrown out of a brothel...

443
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:50,628
...who gave birth and cursed me
before she died.

444
00:48:51,036 --> 00:48:54,005
But l tell you, we belong to the same herd.

445
00:48:54,172 --> 00:48:57,767
Unfortunately for you, Barabbas,
the law is indispensable.

446
00:48:57,843 --> 00:49:00,778
The law is the pass and permit
to life in this world.

447
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:02,974
You were without it.

448
00:49:03,281 --> 00:49:06,512
However, the law here tells me...

449
00:49:07,018 --> 00:49:10,852
...that a man released
by the will of the people at a holy festival...

450
00:49:10,956 --> 00:49:13,516
...cannot thereafter
be given a capital punishment.

451
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:29,735
You can"t kill me?

452
00:49:31,042 --> 00:49:32,873
Easier on you if we could.

453
00:49:38,216 --> 00:49:41,811
l sentence you to transportation for life,
whatever that"s worth...

454
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:44,981
...to the sulfur mines
on the island of Sicily.

455
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:51,860
l can"t...

456
00:49:52,764 --> 00:49:54,095
...be killed.

457
00:49:57,269 --> 00:49:58,668
He meant me to live.

458
00:50:02,274 --> 00:50:04,105
Deliberately he did it.

459
00:50:04,409 --> 00:50:08,175
No killing Barabbas.
No death for Barabbas.

460
00:50:10,515 --> 00:50:12,346
He died in my place.

461
00:50:12,751 --> 00:50:14,776
The death has been paid.

462
00:50:18,757 --> 00:50:20,588
He"s taken my death.

463
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:24,692
That"s it. He"s taken my death.

464
00:50:25,363 --> 00:50:29,197
That light, that wasn"t light.

465
00:50:29,868 --> 00:50:33,360
The dark, that wasn"t dark.

466
00:50:33,605 --> 00:50:35,402
That wasn"t dark, that was life.

467
00:50:35,473 --> 00:50:38,135
-That was life.
-Take the man away.

468
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:41,212
You"ll die and rot, but l"ll live forever!

469
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:45,215
l"ve got my life and you can"t take it!

470
00:50:45,717 --> 00:50:48,117
You stinking fish!

471
00:50:48,219 --> 00:50:51,586
l"ve got my life and you can"t have it!

472
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:54,450
l"ve got my life!

473
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:13,073
-Well, which are you?
-l"m Scorpus.

474
00:51:13,144 --> 00:51:15,510
That means nothing, idiot.
What"s your number?

475
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:18,412
-563.
-That"s better.

476
00:51:23,655 --> 00:51:25,179
564.

477
00:51:27,993 --> 00:51:30,427
-Who"s the god?
-The divine Emperor Tiberius.

478
00:51:30,495 --> 00:51:33,259
You have the privilege
of being his property.

479
00:51:36,034 --> 00:51:37,194
Move.

480
00:51:39,804 --> 00:51:41,328
565.

481
00:51:50,382 --> 00:51:51,849
Go on, move.

482
00:52:15,407 --> 00:52:19,207
That"s all. Move on. Next two.

483
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:45,859
Put your back to it.

484
00:53:00,452 --> 00:53:03,012
Move. Get your feet on the ground.

485
00:53:04,889 --> 00:53:06,516
What are they doing?

486
00:53:06,591 --> 00:53:09,890
They"re sending us down to the next level
to make room for you.

487
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:12,291
That"s how you know
how long you"ve been here...

488
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:14,126
...by how deep you"re down.

489
00:53:14,299 --> 00:53:17,757
They break you in gradually
to get used to the dark.

490
00:55:44,749 --> 00:55:46,046
Wait.

491
00:55:54,692 --> 00:55:56,421
You"ve gotten used to the dark.

492
00:55:57,228 --> 00:55:58,718
Did it take long?

493
00:55:59,931 --> 00:56:01,296
Long enough.

494
00:56:02,267 --> 00:56:03,928
lt"s got into me.

495
00:56:07,605 --> 00:56:08,799
Come here.

496
00:56:16,481 --> 00:56:18,142
What do you see?

497
00:56:27,091 --> 00:56:28,456
You"re blind.

498
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,084
Sulfur burns.

499
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:00,614
Dig.

500
00:57:06,597 --> 00:57:07,859
Here.

501
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:21,468
You"ve got a partner there
that seems to know how to live forever.

502
00:57:22,013 --> 00:57:23,947
Better learn from him.

503
00:57:30,955 --> 00:57:32,650
How long has it been?

504
00:57:34,225 --> 00:57:35,954
Who was emperor then?

505
00:57:38,296 --> 00:57:40,821
Tiberius? That was long ago.

506
00:57:40,898 --> 00:57:42,957
Almost in another world.

507
00:57:44,702 --> 00:57:47,569
Here, l"m called Sahak.

508
00:57:51,542 --> 00:57:53,203
That"s mine.

509
00:57:54,479 --> 00:57:55,673
Here.

510
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:58,546
Move!

511
00:58:05,156 --> 00:58:07,386
You make this even a worse hell than it is.

512
00:58:10,228 --> 00:58:12,389
You don"t care how l got here...

513
00:58:13,164 --> 00:58:14,756
...but l"ll tell you.

514
00:58:15,933 --> 00:58:19,198
The ship l was serving on
took on a cargo of slaves.

515
00:58:19,604 --> 00:58:21,196
Some of them got free.

516
00:58:21,439 --> 00:58:24,374
Slipped over the side, during my watch.

517
00:58:26,778 --> 00:58:29,110
So, the captain put the chains on me.

518
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:34,679
What about your world?

519
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:40,682
What"s your name?

520
00:58:43,194 --> 00:58:46,254
-l asked you what your name is.
-All right.

521
00:58:47,632 --> 00:58:49,566
lf it"s going to keep you quiet.

522
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:52,233
Barabbas.

523
00:58:54,272 --> 00:58:56,103
What are you saying?

524
00:58:57,108 --> 00:58:59,235
Barabbas.

525
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:02,069
What"s the town you came from?

526
00:59:03,381 --> 00:59:04,746
Jerusalem.

527
00:59:05,883 --> 00:59:08,249
Are you the man they acquitted?

528
00:59:14,325 --> 00:59:15,883
What is that to you?

529
00:59:26,471 --> 00:59:29,770
Chained to you, of all men on Earth.

530
00:59:55,933 --> 00:59:59,835
That"s what l like to see, devils and beasts
going for each other"s throats.

531
01:00:00,204 --> 01:00:03,605
Here"s a head of you to hate each other.
Now work, you crazy dogs.

532
01:00:04,175 --> 01:00:05,767
Let"s see you working.

533
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:13,676
Work!

534
01:01:30,761 --> 01:01:32,786
Get out! Move!

535
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:48,773
You hate my name.

536
01:01:50,147 --> 01:01:52,240
You hate the sound of it.

537
01:01:53,451 --> 01:01:56,113
You weren"t even in Jerusalem,
but you hate my name.

538
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:58,154
That"s right. We hate it.

539
01:01:58,322 --> 01:02:01,291
What does it matter?
What does it matter to you?

540
01:02:01,392 --> 01:02:03,986
-You know who was killed in your place?
-Still that?

541
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:06,655
So, why shouldn"t we hate your name?

542
01:02:07,732 --> 01:02:10,895
l thought what he said
was to love one another.

543
01:02:19,844 --> 01:02:21,744
l can"t imagine...

544
01:02:24,415 --> 01:02:26,975
...he expects a man to have a spirit...

545
01:02:27,451 --> 01:02:29,783
...as strong and patient as a dray horse.

546
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:35,581
lt was only something l was told.

547
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:40,856
lf you think l got the best of it,
you stay here for a generation or two.

548
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:43,195
We"ve got a special duty for you two.

549
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:46,327
This"ll show you what happens
to fighting mongrels. Come on.

550
01:03:23,541 --> 01:03:25,702
Why isn"t it all forgotten?

551
01:03:27,578 --> 01:03:29,978
That"s what l don"t understand.

552
01:03:31,716 --> 01:03:37,154
Who"s been spreading things about?
Keeping that tale alive all these years?

553
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:40,153
What could kill it?

554
01:03:42,393 --> 01:03:46,659
When you think it was God"s will
come to Earth to show what he is.

555
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:49,424
l can see the reality of that.

556
01:03:50,868 --> 01:03:54,235
Which is why the name of the Master
goes on growing in the world.

557
01:03:56,173 --> 01:04:00,269
l began to meet it wherever l sailed:
Phoenicia, Cyprus, Greece.

558
01:04:00,911 --> 01:04:02,435
Even at the Port of Rome.

559
01:04:03,681 --> 01:04:06,548
l began to understand what it meant.

560
01:04:07,585 --> 01:04:08,779
But...

561
01:04:11,255 --> 01:04:14,122
...it"s a tough demand, the will of God.

562
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:21,058
l"m a poor hand at it.
And look where l"ve got us now.

563
01:04:21,699 --> 01:04:26,227
Even though l"ve got his sign scratched
on the back of the Emperor"s head.

564
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:29,896
lt means l belong to him,
not to the Emperor.

565
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:34,742
lt"s the sign he has put on us all,
if we give way enough to see it.

566
01:04:34,945 --> 01:04:36,970
Look at this.

567
01:04:38,649 --> 01:04:40,446
There"s the shape of the cross.

568
01:04:41,585 --> 01:04:43,712
Keep your God to yourself.

569
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:46,947
Why did you come here
and rake up old lies about killing God?

570
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:50,891
What"s going on down there?
Move yourselves or l"ll leave you to rot.

571
01:04:54,832 --> 01:04:56,163
Pull!

572
01:05:08,112 --> 01:05:10,012
You think what it"s like to me.

573
01:05:12,616 --> 01:05:15,244
You"re the only man l"ve met who saw him.

574
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:18,653
You were there at the beginning,
and you won"t talk.

575
01:05:18,756 --> 01:05:20,485
You won"t tell me.

576
01:05:21,592 --> 01:05:25,289
-What are you afraid of?
-Nothing l"m afraid of.

577
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:27,691
Then you can tell me.

578
01:05:28,165 --> 01:05:31,498
You see the darkness that went
over heaven and Earth when he died?

579
01:05:31,602 --> 01:05:33,126
Suppose l did.

580
01:05:33,370 --> 01:05:37,466
The man died in a dust storm,
the same as anybody"s death.

581
01:05:38,676 --> 01:05:40,837
Suppose his tomb was empty.

582
01:05:41,178 --> 01:05:44,944
Can"t a dead man be taken away?
You want the truth? l"ll give it to you.

583
01:05:45,182 --> 01:05:47,548
That"s all of your God you"ll get out of me.

584
01:05:55,626 --> 01:05:56,991
Here, what"s the matter?

585
01:05:57,628 --> 01:05:58,686
Come on, get up.

586
01:05:59,396 --> 01:06:02,559
lf they see you can"t work
they take you and you won"t come back.

587
01:06:08,138 --> 01:06:09,867
Hey! Away!

588
01:06:18,315 --> 01:06:19,680
All right, wake up.

589
01:06:19,984 --> 01:06:24,512
-Come on. Move out, all of you.
-Get on your feet. You"ve had your sleep.

590
01:06:24,588 --> 01:06:28,581
-You two, get your feet on the ground.
-Get out of there. Come on. Move!

591
01:06:28,893 --> 01:06:31,555
Root yourselves out! Move, l say!

592
01:06:34,198 --> 01:06:35,495
Wake up.

593
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:40,170
All right, there"s work to be done.

594
01:06:40,938 --> 01:06:42,929
-You"ve had enough sleep now.
-Wake up.

595
01:06:44,108 --> 01:06:47,373
Come on, you! You, over there.
Wake up, you hear me?

596
01:06:47,845 --> 01:06:50,405
-Get on your feet, l say.
-One dead man here.

597
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:55,542
l said get on your feet, all of you.
Now come on. Up on your feet.

598
01:06:56,921 --> 01:07:01,221
-You"ve got to look as if you can work.
-What"s the matter with you?

599
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:05,123
You can"t stand up? Can"t work?

600
01:07:08,732 --> 01:07:10,131
l can work.

601
01:07:15,639 --> 01:07:17,698
Here, this one"s no use.

602
01:11:24,555 --> 01:11:27,547
-How many survivors?
-None, sir. There can"t be any.

603
01:11:27,624 --> 01:11:31,617
-lt was like the end of the world to them.
-The end of the underworld.

604
01:11:31,728 --> 01:11:33,992
-What did you say, sir?
-Nothing.

605
01:11:34,064 --> 01:11:35,088
Survivors!

606
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:36,860
Over here. Survivors.

607
01:11:37,201 --> 01:11:39,169
Get ready to receive survivors!

608
01:11:51,748 --> 01:11:52,908
Away.

609
01:11:53,050 --> 01:11:54,210
Pull!

610
01:13:50,367 --> 01:13:52,995
When they"ve recovered,
put them to work in the fields.

611
01:15:06,777 --> 01:15:09,177
l can taste the salt in the air.

612
01:15:09,579 --> 01:15:12,446
Every breath of wind is full of the sea.

613
01:15:14,818 --> 01:15:18,777
l thought l could never love it
better than l did. But, oh, glory!

614
01:15:18,955 --> 01:15:21,185
After the darkness of the mines...

615
01:15:22,592 --> 01:15:25,527
...l could go and drown in it
like a man besotted.

616
01:15:26,863 --> 01:15:28,990
Now, are you glad to live?

617
01:15:30,133 --> 01:15:32,124
What? Like a damned ox?

618
01:15:32,636 --> 01:15:35,799
Salt me down
and l"d praise God even for this.

619
01:15:35,972 --> 01:15:39,339
How many times were you swindled
in those foreign ports?

620
01:15:40,210 --> 01:15:43,304
You must"ve been the easiest game
they ever got their hands on.

621
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:46,645
-Why is that?
-You"d fall for any trick.

622
01:15:48,552 --> 01:15:49,712
One smile...

623
01:15:50,854 --> 01:15:53,823
...and you trust the world
that half kills you.

624
01:15:53,890 --> 01:15:55,118
Yes, l trust it.

625
01:15:56,126 --> 01:15:57,650
lt has to be hard going...

626
01:15:57,727 --> 01:16:00,719
...or else how will the strength come
that God has wanted?

627
01:16:00,997 --> 01:16:03,397
God should make himself plain
or leave me alone.

628
01:16:04,201 --> 01:16:07,568
Am l the one who lets himself be swindled,
or you?

629
01:16:07,804 --> 01:16:11,137
Every time he came near,
you refused to believe it.

630
01:16:11,408 --> 01:16:13,376
But it"s never been out of your mind.

631
01:16:14,177 --> 01:16:16,975
What other man"s death
could have troubled you so long?

632
01:16:32,229 --> 01:16:34,891
Stop there. Pull over to the side.

633
01:16:40,203 --> 01:16:42,000
Rock to be carried.

634
01:17:19,276 --> 01:17:20,208
Here.

635
01:17:47,404 --> 01:17:50,305
lt"s a poor scratching, but the true sign.

636
01:17:51,942 --> 01:17:54,308
Now will you leave me in peace?

637
01:18:02,285 --> 01:18:04,116
All right, we go on.

638
01:18:20,604 --> 01:18:21,798
Wait.

639
01:18:22,472 --> 01:18:26,306
Julia, there are the two men
l was telling you about.

640
01:18:26,476 --> 01:18:28,774
Send for them, Rufio. l want to see them.

641
01:18:28,845 --> 01:18:31,643
-Bring those men over here to us.
-Very good, sir.

642
01:18:34,818 --> 01:18:38,345
Stop! These two.
Take them off the plough.

643
01:18:39,389 --> 01:18:42,153
Two men so strangely come up
from the underworld.

644
01:18:42,225 --> 01:18:45,558
Twenty years in the mines, the old one.
lndestructible.

645
01:18:45,662 --> 01:18:47,061
l heard so.

646
01:18:55,572 --> 01:18:58,871
You"ve earned the air you breathe,
you two, by sheer good fortune.

647
01:18:59,309 --> 01:19:02,176
-What are your names?
-Sahak, sir.

648
01:19:02,512 --> 01:19:04,878
-And yours?
-Barabbas.

649
01:19:05,915 --> 01:19:07,576
What"s your age?

650
01:19:08,885 --> 01:19:10,147
What does it matter?

651
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:13,678
lndeed, what should it matter?
We understand you mean to live forever.

652
01:19:13,757 --> 01:19:16,351
l must touch them
for the luck that"s in them.

653
01:19:16,426 --> 01:19:18,553
My wife thinks your merit is contagious.

654
01:19:19,062 --> 01:19:21,656
All right,
we don"t want to hold up the work.

655
01:19:21,731 --> 01:19:23,062
Back now.

656
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:46,120
lt"s from the Emperor.

657
01:19:48,858 --> 01:19:51,088
lt seems the gods approve
your superstition.

658
01:19:51,194 --> 01:19:52,525
We"re to call to Rome.

659
01:19:53,029 --> 01:19:56,396
-To Rome? What does it mean?
-l"m to enter the Senate.

660
01:19:56,466 --> 01:20:00,232
-We"re to rise in the world.
-Rufio. Rome!

661
01:20:01,304 --> 01:20:03,397
lt"s true. They are charmed.

662
01:20:03,473 --> 01:20:06,704
We must always take them with us.
A good thing l touched them.

663
01:20:06,776 --> 01:20:08,573
l see, their success, not mine.

664
01:20:08,645 --> 01:20:13,378
Nothing but amiable days from now on,
and knowing everybody instead of nobody.

665
01:20:13,583 --> 01:20:16,575
-When shall we go?
-Ride with us. l"ll give you the answer.

666
01:20:16,653 --> 01:20:20,054
How wretched to arrive
when all have gone to the mountains....

667
01:21:00,096 --> 01:21:01,256
Look over there.

668
01:24:10,787 --> 01:24:13,847
Well, here we have to leave your luck
to learn its business.

669
01:24:13,957 --> 01:24:16,482
What do you mean?
Why do we come here?

670
01:24:16,559 --> 01:24:19,892
They cannot fight yet.
They must first learn the skill.

671
01:24:19,996 --> 01:24:21,293
And so they will.

672
01:24:21,364 --> 01:24:25,232
But here we have to deliver them over.
Let"s hope they won"t disgrace us.

673
01:24:25,335 --> 01:24:29,635
When a charmed life turns professional,
we can expect great things.

674
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:33,803
Flacus, the Commander.
You honor Rome and us.

675
01:24:34,477 --> 01:24:37,173
Our happiness is all here, Commander.

676
01:26:17,013 --> 01:26:20,608
Unsurpassable. The Emperor
has given him his freedom three times.

677
01:26:20,850 --> 01:26:24,809
There"s the third staff of liberty in his hand.
Always he prefers to come back.

678
01:26:24,921 --> 01:26:27,355
He knows his empire
and has the sense to keep it.

679
01:26:27,457 --> 01:26:31,621
Keep it he does.
He"s taken a fair toll of them.

680
01:26:32,528 --> 01:26:35,292
Torvald, the Senator Rufio and his lady.

681
01:26:36,499 --> 01:26:38,330
l"ll take this life.

682
01:26:39,769 --> 01:26:42,863
Can"t a man be made mad
by the smell of blood?

683
01:26:44,674 --> 01:26:46,801
A man can understand this.

684
01:27:04,026 --> 01:27:06,893
To throw the net, hold it to your right,
like this.

685
01:27:08,131 --> 01:27:10,725
Then throw from the tips of your fingers,
like this.

686
01:27:14,737 --> 01:27:16,398
Your places now.

687
01:27:16,873 --> 01:27:19,000
One here, you here and you over there.

688
01:27:19,675 --> 01:27:22,371
Now, start your practice. Throw your nets.

689
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:25,211
What"s this?

690
01:27:25,314 --> 01:27:28,977
Have they mistaken this place
for an old men"s hospital?

691
01:27:29,519 --> 01:27:31,350
The gray-haired one?

692
01:27:31,721 --> 01:27:35,384
They say there"s something remarkable
about him. Nothing can kill him.

693
01:28:13,696 --> 01:28:16,290
Show me what you can do, grandfather.

694
01:29:21,163 --> 01:29:23,597
What do we do with aging fish,
grandfather?

695
01:29:24,533 --> 01:29:26,524
lt"s time he was thrown to the gulls.

696
01:29:29,772 --> 01:29:31,137
Let me be.

697
01:29:33,976 --> 01:29:35,307
Hit! One!

698
01:29:36,012 --> 01:29:37,843
Hit! Two!

699
01:29:52,628 --> 01:29:54,061
You move on.

700
01:32:31,954 --> 01:32:34,445
Bring out the first group of gladiators.

701
01:32:55,845 --> 01:32:56,903
You remember me?

702
01:32:57,480 --> 01:33:00,176
You drew the sign of the Master
beside my plate.

703
01:33:00,249 --> 01:33:02,183
How did you know l carried the sign?

704
01:33:02,251 --> 01:33:05,152
Several days l"ve watched you
breaking the bread.

705
01:33:06,021 --> 01:33:07,318
Can we speak freely?

706
01:33:07,389 --> 01:33:10,085
He was there in Jerusalem.
He knew the Master.

707
01:33:12,595 --> 01:33:14,756
God be praised and keep you safe.

708
01:33:17,733 --> 01:33:21,669
The days have been getting darker for us.
Persecution increasing.

709
01:33:21,737 --> 01:33:24,103
The Emperor wants to destroy
every trace of us.

710
01:33:30,212 --> 01:33:33,272
But tomorrow, when the games are over
and the sun is down...

711
01:33:33,382 --> 01:33:35,043
...discipline will be lax...

712
01:33:35,384 --> 01:33:39,252
...and there may be a chance for me
to lead you to where we meet.

713
01:33:39,355 --> 01:33:42,017
The Master"s disciple, Peter,
is here in Rome.

714
01:33:42,791 --> 01:33:46,420
Seldom enough l find my way there,
some way off to the catacombs.

715
01:33:46,729 --> 01:33:50,028
The catacombs?
Surely it"s the dead who meet there.

716
01:33:50,099 --> 01:33:52,363
lt may seem to you that the faith is buried.

717
01:33:52,434 --> 01:33:54,925
But so is the seed
before there can be a harvest.

718
01:33:55,037 --> 01:33:56,766
First group, assemble.

719
01:33:56,972 --> 01:33:59,440
You shall see tomorrow
the life we keep there.

720
01:33:59,542 --> 01:34:01,305
First group, assemble.

721
01:34:01,577 --> 01:34:03,909
-Did you hear him, Barabbas?
-l heard.

722
01:34:12,421 --> 01:34:16,824
One, two, one, two....

723
01:34:38,781 --> 01:34:40,612
To your fighting places.

724
01:34:42,918 --> 01:34:43,748
Go.

725
01:34:56,699 --> 01:34:59,167
When you"ve taken up these positions
tomorrow...

726
01:34:59,268 --> 01:35:01,031
...the trumpets will sound.

727
01:35:01,136 --> 01:35:02,694
And from above you, there...

728
01:35:03,105 --> 01:35:05,539
...the white cloth will be thrown
into the arena.

729
01:35:05,975 --> 01:35:09,376
When it touches the ground,
the contest will begin.

730
01:35:10,512 --> 01:35:13,970
To make sure you understand,
this is the way it will happen.

731
01:35:53,222 --> 01:35:55,713
Kill him! Kill him!

732
01:38:12,528 --> 01:38:14,621
-That"s an angry crowd.
-They want blood.

733
01:38:14,696 --> 01:38:17,824
They were driven to a frenzy by Sahak,
who wouldn"t kill his man.

734
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:20,733
lf the Emperor were here,
he wouldn"t have had a choice.

735
01:38:20,836 --> 01:38:21,996
Wait till tomorrow.

736
01:38:22,070 --> 01:38:25,039
He"ll get his quota of killing,
if you"re lucky to win.

737
01:38:25,140 --> 01:38:27,404
-Not one life will he get from me.
-Won"t he?

738
01:38:27,509 --> 01:38:30,410
Say that to the Emperor.
He will teach you the ways.

739
01:38:30,512 --> 01:38:33,413
-When he says death, death it is.
-The true God says life.

740
01:38:33,515 --> 01:38:35,983
-l only answer to him.
-Hark at this man.

741
01:38:37,319 --> 01:38:39,583
By God, if he contradicts the Emperor....

742
01:38:39,688 --> 01:38:42,987
-Who do you call your God?
-The only one.

743
01:38:43,592 --> 01:38:47,358
The rest are inventions of fear,
tales taken from the past...

744
01:38:47,596 --> 01:38:50,759
...they can no more help you
than this breast can bleed.

745
01:38:50,866 --> 01:38:51,855
Put "em down.

746
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:55,492
-lnsulting the gods before we go fight.
-What revenge will Mars take?

747
01:38:55,571 --> 01:38:57,766
None at all. He doesn"t exist.

748
01:38:57,873 --> 01:39:01,070
Mars doesn"t exist?
What do you mean, he doesn"t exist?

749
01:39:01,844 --> 01:39:03,505
Will you keep your mouth shut?

750
01:39:03,679 --> 01:39:07,171
The real God is greater
than any man"s thoughts can imagine.

751
01:39:08,617 --> 01:39:11,586
He made life as deep and strong
as the sea.

752
01:39:12,221 --> 01:39:15,122
Your gods are as shallow
as a reeking pond.

753
01:39:15,224 --> 01:39:20,059
He"s above us and around us, in us.
Like the breath in our bodies.

754
01:39:20,562 --> 01:39:23,463
And he has one law
that will break our pattern.

755
01:39:23,699 --> 01:39:25,360
The law is love.

756
01:39:26,268 --> 01:39:29,101
Whatever we do
that breaks that law condemns us.

757
01:39:30,606 --> 01:39:33,268
And so that we should see
what his love is...

758
01:39:33,375 --> 01:39:36,970
...he sent his son to live the life of a man.

759
01:39:37,913 --> 01:39:40,814
To show that God understands
the life he has made.

760
01:39:41,483 --> 01:39:43,815
-Who spun you this?
-What do you want us to do?

761
01:39:43,919 --> 01:39:45,648
What good will he do us in the arena?

762
01:39:45,754 --> 01:39:48,154
We"ll lose the goodwill
of the gods we know.

763
01:39:48,257 --> 01:39:52,159
Tomorrow in the arena, show the Emperor
that we know what life"s worth.

764
01:39:53,061 --> 01:39:54,756
Throw away your weapons.

765
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:58,722
Do you think all the things
of the Earth and the heavens...

766
01:39:59,001 --> 01:40:03,165
...have been made for no other reason
except we should eat and make money...

767
01:40:03,272 --> 01:40:05,672
...and spawn children and kill and die?

768
01:40:09,311 --> 01:40:11,245
What a purpose for creation!

769
01:40:15,183 --> 01:40:17,515
lf anything"s beyond belief, that is.

770
01:40:19,955 --> 01:40:22,685
God said, ""Burn away the old world...

771
01:40:23,825 --> 01:40:26,487
""...and let a new one rise from the ashes.""

772
01:40:26,662 --> 01:40:30,154
As the Son of God rose from the dead,
he died for us.

773
01:40:31,466 --> 01:40:34,026
Ask Barabbas here the truth
of what l tell you.

774
01:40:34,136 --> 01:40:37,503
He saw with his own eyes the Son of God
when he lived among us.

775
01:40:37,606 --> 01:40:38,800
Saw him die.

776
01:40:38,874 --> 01:40:41,274
Was there, in the garden,
on the third morning.

777
01:40:41,343 --> 01:40:42,640
You saw him, Barabbas?

778
01:40:42,711 --> 01:40:45,145
-Tell us what you saw.
-What happened?

779
01:40:45,213 --> 01:40:48,444
A long time ago l saw a man.

780
01:40:48,884 --> 01:40:50,442
Some people say he was...

781
01:40:50,519 --> 01:40:52,214
-...the Son of God.
-Enough!

782
01:40:52,321 --> 01:40:54,118
You"ve condemned yourselves.

783
01:40:54,189 --> 01:40:56,783
l charge you with sedition
and stirring up mutiny.

784
01:40:56,858 --> 01:40:58,553
You"re both under arrest.

785
01:40:58,660 --> 01:41:01,823
Take them out and put them in chains.
Move now!

786
01:41:06,969 --> 01:41:10,996
Let me be sure you understand
the seriousness of the charge against you.

787
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:15,334
Not only with holding views proscribed
by the State...

788
01:41:16,178 --> 01:41:20,239
...for which the punishment is death,
but of recommending those views...

789
01:41:20,382 --> 01:41:22,816
...to men sworn to the State"s service.

790
01:41:24,186 --> 01:41:27,747
What is more,
you"ve betrayed your faith to me...

791
01:41:29,257 --> 01:41:31,248
...who brought you to this city...

792
01:41:31,827 --> 01:41:35,820
...and laid me under possible suspicion
of connivance in the eyes of the Emperor.

793
01:41:36,198 --> 01:41:38,359
The prospect is black for you.

794
01:41:39,368 --> 01:41:40,995
You know what this is?

795
01:41:41,903 --> 01:41:46,237
-The stamp of the Roman State.
-Which means that you"re Rome"s property.

796
01:41:50,112 --> 01:41:51,704
What"s this cut here?

797
01:41:53,715 --> 01:41:55,342
The sign of my master.

798
01:41:56,852 --> 01:42:00,618
-Who do you call your master?
-The one who is my lord.

799
01:42:01,289 --> 01:42:04,747
-The Son of the Father.
-ln other words, the Christian sign?

800
01:42:05,694 --> 01:42:09,255
A religion which sets itself up
to menace government and order.

801
01:42:09,931 --> 01:42:12,798
Which denies the divine authority
of the Emperor.

802
01:42:13,735 --> 01:42:17,068
Which preaches that the slave is equal
to the free man...

803
01:42:18,106 --> 01:42:22,702
...and would reduce society to anarchy.
A rebellious, insufferable doctrine.

804
01:42:24,913 --> 01:42:28,644
Give me a direct answer.
Do you belong to the State?

805
01:42:29,951 --> 01:42:31,919
l belong to the Lord, my god.

806
01:42:40,395 --> 01:42:42,454
So, you also believe in this god?

807
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:46,265
Tell me, do you?

808
01:42:48,103 --> 01:42:49,229
You don"t?

809
01:42:50,138 --> 01:42:52,732
Then why do you bear his name
on your disc?

810
01:42:54,342 --> 01:42:55,809
lsn"t he your god?

811
01:42:56,678 --> 01:42:59,078
lsn"t that what the inscription means?

812
01:43:01,316 --> 01:43:02,578
l have no god.

813
01:43:04,786 --> 01:43:06,276
l don"t understand.

814
01:43:07,656 --> 01:43:11,649
Why then do you bear this sign
of Jesus Christ, scratched on your disc?

815
01:43:14,529 --> 01:43:15,757
Because l...

816
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:19,929
...tried to believe.

817
01:43:25,207 --> 01:43:28,301
l"ll give you the opportunity
to recover your senses.

818
01:43:29,711 --> 01:43:32,703
lf you"ll admit publicly
to the men you spoke to...

819
01:43:32,981 --> 01:43:36,678
...that all these things were lies,
you may save your life.

820
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:40,153
Will you do this?

821
01:43:42,390 --> 01:43:45,018
That would be to lose my life, not save it.

822
01:43:46,328 --> 01:43:48,023
What l am is his.

823
01:43:49,531 --> 01:43:51,362
But isn"t life dear to you?

824
01:43:52,067 --> 01:43:53,227
Yes, it is.

825
01:43:54,336 --> 01:43:58,204
And you understand the cruel death
that punishes mutiny and sedition?

826
01:44:00,809 --> 01:44:02,299
What do you choose?

827
01:44:04,579 --> 01:44:05,978
l choose my god.

828
01:44:10,018 --> 01:44:12,043
Then there is no more l can do for you.

829
01:44:12,988 --> 01:44:14,546
Guilty of the charge.

830
01:44:15,056 --> 01:44:16,921
Execution at sunrise.

831
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:20,425
You"re as mad as your god.

832
01:44:22,998 --> 01:44:25,330
You, come here.

833
01:44:48,723 --> 01:44:52,921
Unwise to carry around with you
what you don"t believe in.

834
01:45:00,735 --> 01:45:04,227
lt may be the Master means you to live.

835
01:45:06,274 --> 01:45:08,606
He may have some greater need of you.

836
01:45:10,078 --> 01:45:12,069
Some other purpose, Barabbas.

837
01:45:13,248 --> 01:45:15,648
-Something else.
-Take him away.

838
01:45:15,750 --> 01:45:16,978
Guards.

839
01:45:18,453 --> 01:45:21,581
Now you"ll have to be worth two men
to take his place.

840
01:45:21,656 --> 01:45:23,089
You may go.

841
01:46:28,990 --> 01:46:32,323
You are to witness the punishment
of this man...

842
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:35,222
...so that there can be no doubt
in your mind...

843
01:46:35,330 --> 01:46:39,733
...that the words he spoke to you
were a gross breach of the law.

844
01:46:39,834 --> 01:46:42,302
An iniquitous crime against the State.

845
01:46:42,570 --> 01:46:45,130
Not only lies, but treasonable lies...

846
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:48,871
...which were not only aimed
at spreading rebellion among you...

847
01:46:48,977 --> 01:46:51,002
...but also to pervert your minds...

848
01:46:51,646 --> 01:46:55,377
...from those acceptable religions
on which the State is built.

849
01:46:55,817 --> 01:46:58,809
Any man who thinks
that those words are harmless...

850
01:46:59,587 --> 01:47:04,183
...or thinks that he can repeat or conform
to such words as this man spoke...

851
01:47:04,859 --> 01:47:09,091
...let him take warning from
the punishment you are about to witness.

852
01:47:09,564 --> 01:47:11,361
Long live the Emperor!

853
01:47:13,435 --> 01:47:14,834
Proceed, Torvald.

854
01:47:18,206 --> 01:47:19,571
Positions.

855
01:47:24,346 --> 01:47:25,404
Ready.

856
01:47:28,783 --> 01:47:29,841
Throw.

857
01:47:32,954 --> 01:47:34,353
Traitors and fools!

858
01:48:00,148 --> 01:48:02,309
You"ll wish this was better done.

859
01:58:29,443 --> 01:58:31,240
Kill him! Kill him!

860
01:59:37,011 --> 01:59:41,448
Gladiator Barabbas, you"re becoming
quite a legend among us, l hear.

861
01:59:42,349 --> 01:59:44,579
For your remarkable persistence in life...

862
01:59:44,919 --> 01:59:47,615
...we have a traditional answer
to this public acclaim.

863
01:59:50,958 --> 01:59:53,791
We make you a free man.
We give you your liberty.

864
01:59:54,595 --> 01:59:56,586
Here is the symbol of your freedom.

865
02:03:19,800 --> 02:03:21,358
l brought him to you.

866
02:03:22,069 --> 02:03:24,503
This is where he would have wanted
to be buried.

867
02:03:25,339 --> 02:03:26,897
Our brother Sahak.

868
02:03:58,706 --> 02:04:01,106
So you had to carry
your dead conscience here.

869
02:04:01,208 --> 02:04:03,438
Did he have to die
before you cared about him?

870
02:04:03,544 --> 02:04:06,104
Are you more concerned with his body
than his life?

871
02:04:06,213 --> 02:04:08,545
You were willing to let him
go to his death alone.

872
02:04:08,615 --> 02:04:10,879
Why should you help him
now he doesn"t need you?

873
02:04:10,951 --> 02:04:13,442
How could l have helped him
by being killed?

874
02:04:13,554 --> 02:04:16,216
He made his own death.
What good has it done?

875
02:04:17,224 --> 02:04:19,249
l had to go on living, he said.

876
02:04:20,094 --> 02:04:25,555
-There was something l still had to do.
-Barabbas, why should you believe it?

877
02:04:26,367 --> 02:04:29,029
When the light shone,
you wouldn"t accept it.

878
02:04:29,636 --> 02:04:31,866
When the dark came, you denied it.

879
02:04:32,706 --> 02:04:35,937
When the spirit of God beckoned,
you refused it.

880
02:04:36,877 --> 02:04:39,937
When Sahak says
your life is kept for some purpose...

881
02:04:40,581 --> 02:04:42,139
...why should you believe it?

882
02:04:42,249 --> 02:04:44,945
To make a gag for your conscience,
is that it?

883
02:04:46,286 --> 02:04:48,754
You believe it because it suits you.

884
02:04:49,456 --> 02:04:53,051
Or maybe if Sahak stood before you now
then you would say you believed.

885
02:04:53,127 --> 02:04:54,788
You would repent and love God.

886
02:04:56,096 --> 02:04:57,495
lt would be easy.

887
02:04:58,465 --> 02:05:01,161
But what strength
would your belief have then?

888
02:05:03,404 --> 02:05:04,962
What would it matter?

889
02:05:06,473 --> 02:05:09,101
Jesus of Nazareth was killed instead of me.

890
02:05:12,079 --> 02:05:14,980
There must have been a reason. Why me?

891
02:05:15,349 --> 02:05:16,907
Why did he choose me?

892
02:05:23,957 --> 02:05:25,754
Where have you gone?

893
02:05:26,994 --> 02:05:28,120
You!

894
02:05:29,196 --> 02:05:30,458
Where are you?

895
02:05:32,866 --> 02:05:34,094
Wait for me.

896
02:05:34,468 --> 02:05:35,696
Wait!

897
02:05:36,336 --> 02:05:37,530
You wait!

898
02:05:59,660 --> 02:06:01,651
For God"s sake, where are you?

899
02:06:03,030 --> 02:06:05,521
Show me the way! l"m lost!

900
02:06:12,506 --> 02:06:14,303
Which way shall l go?

901
02:07:24,811 --> 02:07:26,642
-What"s happening?
-Rome is burning.

902
02:07:26,747 --> 02:07:28,908
Can"t you see? Rome is burning.

903
02:08:12,292 --> 02:08:15,921
-What happened to make the fire?
-The Christians tried to burn down Rome.

904
02:08:15,996 --> 02:08:18,521
-Move! Move that case. Come on.
-Christians?

905
02:08:29,176 --> 02:08:32,202
-The Christians are burning Rome!
-lt"s the Christians!

906
02:08:32,346 --> 02:08:33,370
Fire!

907
02:08:48,829 --> 02:08:51,024
They"re burning away the old world.

908
02:08:54,635 --> 02:08:56,398
The new kingdom is coming.

909
02:09:00,007 --> 02:09:00,871
God.

910
02:09:02,542 --> 02:09:04,806
You won"t find me failing this time.

911
02:10:32,399 --> 02:10:34,890
What are you doing, madman?

912
02:10:34,968 --> 02:10:38,995
Fire of God destroying the old world.
The hour has come when all is to perish.

913
02:10:39,106 --> 02:10:41,438
-Are you a Christian?
-Yes, l am.

914
02:10:41,842 --> 02:10:44,072
And l"m ready for Him!

915
02:10:44,945 --> 02:10:48,938
The whole world will soon be ablaze.
Do you hear that?

916
02:10:49,816 --> 02:10:51,477
We"re burning the way.

917
02:10:52,252 --> 02:10:54,413
We"re ready for his coming.

918
02:10:57,457 --> 02:10:59,823
-Take him away.
-The Master!

919
02:11:00,761 --> 02:11:03,662
-The Master"s coming to build a new world.
-Away!

920
02:11:03,764 --> 02:11:06,756
Let me go!
l must make ready for his coming!

921
02:11:08,001 --> 02:11:10,765
Let me go!

922
02:11:17,010 --> 02:11:19,706
Here! Get yourself out of this one.

923
02:11:19,880 --> 02:11:24,374
Here"s one of your kind who was caught
in the act, setting light to a storehouse.

924
02:11:28,021 --> 02:11:31,855
He admits he"s a Christian,
burning the city to start a new kingdom.

925
02:11:32,993 --> 02:11:34,984
The only honest man among you.

926
02:11:39,966 --> 02:11:42,662
Who are you?
We"ve never seen you before.

927
02:11:42,736 --> 02:11:45,227
ls it true?
Were you setting fire to a storehouse?

928
02:11:45,338 --> 02:11:46,202
Yes.

929
02:11:46,306 --> 02:11:48,900
-We"ve never seen you before.
-Who are you?

930
02:11:50,477 --> 02:11:52,308
My name is Barabbas.

931
02:11:53,914 --> 02:11:57,350
-Barabbas, the robber.
-Barabbas, the acquitted.

932
02:11:57,651 --> 02:12:00,176
This burning city is no work of ours.

933
02:12:01,021 --> 02:12:04,013
This isn"t how the new kingdom
is going to be made.

934
02:12:04,191 --> 02:12:05,249
You were wrong.

935
02:12:06,827 --> 02:12:08,988
Who are you to tell me l"m wrong?

936
02:12:10,363 --> 02:12:12,991
Many years ago we spoke together.

937
02:12:13,567 --> 02:12:15,057
You remember?

938
02:12:15,535 --> 02:12:16,399
No.

939
02:12:17,170 --> 02:12:20,105
You asked me why l was making a net
so far from the sea.

940
02:12:24,578 --> 02:12:25,704
Jerusalem.

941
02:12:28,348 --> 02:12:30,111
The street of the potters.

942
02:12:30,350 --> 02:12:33,376
You were mistaken of us then
as you are again now.

943
02:12:37,624 --> 02:12:39,285
We didn"t set fire to the city.

944
02:12:39,392 --> 02:12:41,860
You"ve done the work of the wild beast,
the Emperor.

945
02:12:41,928 --> 02:12:45,056
-Are you a lunatic?
-lt was his fire, you fool, not God"s.

946
02:12:45,131 --> 02:12:47,292
Why can"t God make himself plain?

947
02:12:50,070 --> 02:12:52,300
What"s become of all the fine hopes?

948
02:12:52,606 --> 02:12:54,699
The trumpets, the angels?

949
02:12:56,109 --> 02:12:57,804
All the promises?

950
02:12:59,880 --> 02:13:04,146
Every time l"ve seen it end up the same
way, with torments and dead bodies...

951
02:13:04,251 --> 02:13:06,082
...with no good come of it.

952
02:13:16,062 --> 02:13:17,393
All for nothing.

953
02:13:17,964 --> 02:13:21,297
Do you think they persecute us
to destroy nothing?

954
02:13:22,435 --> 02:13:25,495
Or do you think that
what has battered on your soul...

955
02:13:25,605 --> 02:13:27,937
...for twenty years has been nothing?

956
02:13:28,308 --> 02:13:32,745
lt wasn"t for nothing that Christ died.
Mankind isn"t nothing.

957
02:13:33,914 --> 02:13:36,940
ln his eyes,
each individual man is the whole world.

958
02:13:37,584 --> 02:13:40,417
He loves each man
as though there were no other.

959
02:13:40,687 --> 02:13:43,781
l was the opposite of everything he taught,
wasn"t l?

960
02:13:45,492 --> 02:13:47,824
Why did he let himself be killed
instead of me?

961
02:13:47,928 --> 02:13:51,159
Because being farthest from him,
you were the nearest.

962
02:13:52,499 --> 02:13:56,299
-l"m no nearer than l was before.
-Nor any farther away.

963
02:13:57,270 --> 02:14:00,762
The truth of the matter is,
he"s never moved from your side.

964
02:14:04,978 --> 02:14:06,502
l can tell you this.

965
02:14:07,347 --> 02:14:11,215
There has been a wrestling in your spirit,
back and forth in your life...

966
02:14:11,451 --> 02:14:16,718
...which in itself is knowledge of God.
By the conflict you have known him.

967
02:14:17,557 --> 02:14:21,721
l can tell you as well, that so it will be
with the coming of the kingdom.

968
02:14:21,995 --> 02:14:26,125
That wrestling back and forth
and the laboring of the world spirit...

969
02:14:26,800 --> 02:14:28,734
...like a woman in childbirth.

970
02:14:31,171 --> 02:14:32,968
We are only the beginning.

971
02:14:33,840 --> 02:14:37,173
We won"t see the time
when the Earth is full of the kingdom.

972
02:14:37,243 --> 02:14:40,144
And yet, even now, even here...

973
02:14:41,014 --> 02:14:43,073
...we are at the end ourselves.

974
02:14:44,584 --> 02:14:46,347
The kingdom is within us.

975
02:14:47,687 --> 02:14:49,678
There is nothing more to fear.

976
02:14:50,523 --> 02:14:55,358
Upon us, the years will be built.
Many years, many martyrdoms.

977
02:14:56,563 --> 02:14:59,555
The ground of men is very stubborn
to mature.

978
02:15:00,567 --> 02:15:06,699
But men will look back to us in our day
and will wonder and remember our hope.

979
02:15:09,509 --> 02:15:11,568
It is the end of the day.

980
02:15:13,346 --> 02:15:15,940
We shall trust ourselves to a little pain...

981
02:15:17,250 --> 02:15:18,512
...and sleep.

982
02:15:19,719 --> 02:15:21,346
Saying to the world:

983
02:15:22,288 --> 02:15:23,846
""God"s speed.""

984
02:15:42,275 --> 02:15:43,936
What hour is it?

985
02:15:46,413 --> 02:15:47,903
Night or day?

986
02:15:58,324 --> 02:16:00,053
The sixth hour goes...

987
02:16:02,395 --> 02:16:04,226
...when darkness....

988
02:16:24,617 --> 02:16:26,107
Darkness....

989
02:16:31,157 --> 02:16:32,954
l give myself up...

990
02:16:34,627 --> 02:16:36,356
...into your keeping.

991
02:16:53,146 --> 02:16:54,636
lt is...

992
02:16:55,648 --> 02:16:56,842
...Barabbas.
