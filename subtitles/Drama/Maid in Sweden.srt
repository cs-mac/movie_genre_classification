set you up with a man

164
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:22,627
Set up?

165
00:10:23,242 --> 00:10:25,705
I don't want to be set up.

166
00:10:26,496 --> 00:10:30,656
You are like an orchid
in a greenhouse, baby.

167
00:10:30,656 --> 00:10:32,679
A bee has to come and find you.

168
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:35,450
A flower can't go around
looking for a bee.

169
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:38,095
I'm only looking at high class
men who graduated

170
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,739
from good schools and come
from good families.

171
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:42,158
You just wait.

172
00:10:42,971 --> 00:10:43,930
I don't know.

173
00:10:44,704 --> 00:10:48,641
I want to focus on my
business management classes for now.

174
00:10:48,641 --> 00:10:50,379
Please keep that in mind.

175
00:10:52,094 --> 00:10:53,694
Baby...

176
00:10:57,348 --> 00:10:59,340
What do I do?

177
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,413
I can't even tell my honey about this.

178
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:13,682
That convenience store where
she works was around here somewhere.

179
00:11:13,682 --> 00:11:15,083
Give me back my money.

180
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,094
Let go.

181
00:11:16,094 --> 00:11:18,133
Give me my money.

182
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:19,658
Let go of this.

183
00:11:19,658 --> 00:11:22,595
I told you I can't return the money
spent on appeasing the spirits.

184
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,782
You said I would get a job
if I did as you said.

185
00:11:26,782 --> 00:11:29,796
You didn't get a job
because you weren't devout enough.

186
00:11:29,796 --> 00:11:31,348
Seriously...

187
00:11:31,348 --> 00:11:33,629
You should try to
appease the spirits again.

188
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:36,517
- I'll do it for 5 million won.
- You think I'll get fooled again?

189
00:11:36,517 --> 00:11:39,220
Just give me back my money!

190
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,197
If you feel wronged,
sue me.

191
00:11:43,094 --> 00:11:45,187
My money...

192
00:11:57,523 --> 00:11:59,199
Are you okay?

193
00:12:12,777 --> 00:12:13,992
Thank you.

194
00:12:14,384 --> 00:12:16,253
You should drink it
while it's still warm.

195
00:12:16,253 --> 00:12:18,574
My grandmother once said...

196
00:12:18,574 --> 00:12:21,467
When you are cold both
inside and out...

197
00:12:21,467 --> 00:12:24,325
You should warm up your
inside first.

198
00:12:24,325 --> 00:12:25,562
I see.

199
00:12:28,971 --> 00:12:31,589
I seem pathetic to you, don't I?

200
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:33,078
Not at all.

201
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:35,762
In life, misfortunes happen.

202
00:12:36,695 --> 00:12:41,060
I failed and failed again
at getting a job.

203
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:44,549
I was at the end of a cliff.

204
00:12:45,552 --> 00:12:47,874
That's when somebody held out his hand.

205
00:12:49,504 --> 00:12:54,100
I thought that he was trying to help.

206
00:13:04,081 --> 00:13:07,618
<i>My father died when I was young.</i>

207
00:13:08,348 --> 00:13:12,282
<i>My mom raised me and my
sister all by herself.</i>

208
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:20,262
<i>I wanted to get a job soon,
and take care of my mother.</i>

209
00:13:21,623 --> 00:13:24,785
<i>I'm sorry, but you didn't get the job.</i>

210
00:13:26,826 --> 00:13:31,259
<i>I tried so hard for several years,
but I still couldn't get a job.</i>

211
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:34,230
The spirits are against you.
Of course, you can't find a job.

212
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,123
What?

213
00:13:35,123 --> 00:13:36,818
You should come visit.

214
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:41,655
<i>That's when they approached me.</i>

215
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,732
Let's see...
God of rice cakes...

216
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,665
You see how it fell right off?

217
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:56,673
If you pay to appease the spirits,
it'll stick right on.

218
00:13:56,673 --> 00:14:00,081
I'll really be able to get a job then?

219
00:14:00,081 --> 00:14:04,285
For the past year, I've helped
numerous people find jobs...

220
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:08,371
- How many exactly?
- 1387 people.

221
00:14:08,371 --> 00:14:09,575
You heard?

222
00:14:09,575 --> 00:14:11,882
Including you, that
would be 1388.

223
00:14:21,677 --> 00:14:24,008
<i>I gave him 10 million won.</i>

224
00:14:24,008 --> 00:14:26,968
<i>I even borrowed money
from a loan shark to pay him.</i>

225
00:14:26,968 --> 00:14:28,171
Please.

226
00:14:28,574 --> 00:14:30,080
Please.

227
00:14:30,383 --> 00:14:31,706
Please.

228
00:14:31,706 --> 00:14:36,086
In the end, I failed.

229
00:14:37,766 --> 00:14:41,014
He pretended to hold my hand
at the end of a cliff...

230
00:14:42,105 --> 00:14:44,093
but he just pushed me off.

231
00:14:51,235 --> 00:14:53,906
Did you try reporting it to the police?

232
00:14:53,906 --> 00:14:55,809
This is complete fraud.

233
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:57,857
I tried.

234
00:14:58,695 --> 00:15:01,643
But they said they can't be prosecuted.

235
00:15:02,581 --> 00:15:04,371
Who can I blame?

236
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:09,147
I'm the dumb one for
believing in their lies.

237
00:15:13,118 --> 00:15:17,544
I wish I could die right now.

238
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,671
Don't say that.

239
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:23,179
I'll get that money back for you.

240
00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:26,879
Then you will be able to work
on finding yourself a job.

241
00:15:27,824 --> 00:15:30,658
Why would you do that?

242
00:15:31,136 --> 00:15:32,244
Huh?

243
00:15:38,283 --> 00:15:39,538
Look.

244
00:15:39,742 --> 00:15:42,978
I was cheated by that guy, too.

245
00:15:42,978 --> 00:15:46,554
I'll get that money
back for you no matter what.

246
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:50,008
Thank you for your kind gesture.

247
00:15:50,008 --> 00:15:52,437
It's time for me to work.

248
00:15:52,437 --> 00:15:54,424
I need to get going.

249
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:12,591
- [Day before the bar exam, 8:40 PM]
- I'm home!

250
00:16:12,591 --> 00:16:16,771
I want to get Eun Chul married off
as soon as he becomes a judge.

251
00:16:16,771 --> 00:16:18,571
Please look for a good match for him.

252
00:16:20,935 --> 00:16:22,384
Of course.

253
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,849
At least that much.

254
00:16:25,849 --> 00:16:29,017
For those who commit crimes listed in

255
00:16:29,017 --> 00:16:32,516
sections 329 to 332, up to half

256
00:16:32,516 --> 00:16:38,574
of those crimes can be punished by...

257
00:16:41,302 --> 00:16:42,697
Where did I put it?

258
00:16:43,844 --> 00:16:45,691
Is Young Mi making you do that?

259
00:16:45,691 --> 00:16:48,326
Yeah, Young Mi told me to
put it in when you weren't looking.

260
00:16:53,454 --> 00:16:56,326
You do whatever
she tells you to do?

261
00:16:57,978 --> 00:17:01,184
Eun Chul, are you okay?

262
00:17:01,184 --> 00:17:04,394
Go and throw out that
talisman right now.

263
00:17:05,336 --> 00:17:08,626
Still, Young Mi thought of you,
and spent a fortune on this.

264
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:13,566
Get out.

265
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:16,920
Fine.

266
00:17:23,565 --> 00:17:25,990
<i>He didn't get cut
from the training institute.</i>

267
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,009
<i>My son quit and left.</i>

268
00:17:28,009 --> 00:17:29,854
<i>It didn't fit him well.</i>

269
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,107
- [National Diplomatic Academy, 2 years ago]
- Mr. Kim Eun Chul.

270
00:17:40,141 --> 00:17:42,997
Don't you know the
meaning of a group project?

271
00:17:42,997 --> 00:17:45,552
I gave you a warning
last time, too.

272
00:17:45,552 --> 00:17:48,134
But again, you've handed in a report
that you worked on by yourself.

273
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:51,360
I had no choice because I
couldn't agree with the group.

274
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,807
Did you even try to
come to an agreement?

275
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:55,600
From what I heard...

276
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,436
You made a rash decision
saying that you

277
00:17:58,436 --> 00:18:01,273
can't work with people
below your level.

278
00:18:01,961 --> 00:18:05,157
I was speaking the truth when I said
they are low level people.

279
00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:09,206
Mr. Kim Eun Chul.

280
00:18:10,025 --> 00:18:14,076
I hope you know that your
evaluations are one of the worst.

281
00:18:14,076 --> 00:18:20,225
Your rash and uncooperative attitude
is unfit for diplomatic work.

282
00:18:23,575 --> 00:18:26,750
That idiotic dictator...

283
00:18:27,384 --> 00:18:29,840
I heard he didn't participate
in the group project again.

284
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:33,467
He thinks he's better
than everyone else.

285
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,383
Even if he goes through the training,
he won't get any job offers.

286
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:38,543
Of course not.

287
00:18:38,543 --> 00:18:40,295
What's the use of being smart?

288
00:18:40,295 --> 00:18:41,889
He's got no social skills.

289
00:18:41,889 --> 00:18:44,812
He'll just continue to act
like a loser, and get cut.

290
00:18:56,797 --> 00:18:58,742
You quit and left?

291
00:18:58,742 --> 00:19:00,599
They may have passed the
foreign service

292
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:02,456
officer exam, but they are
at such a low level.

293
00:19:02,456 --> 00:19:05,017
I could never work
in that environment.

294
00:19:06,765 --> 00:19:10,456
You said even the Minister of Foreign
Affairs called and asked you to stay.

295
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:12,569
He did.

296
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:16,834
My colleagues wanted me to stay, too.

297
00:19:16,834 --> 00:19:20,827
Then maybe you should
have just stuck around.

298
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,278
Even when you took the public
officer qualification

299
00:19:23,278 --> 00:19:25,728
exam, you left during the
training period.

300
00:19:26,362 --> 00:19:27,497
Mother.

301
00:19:27,497 --> 00:19:31,008
I want to take the bar exam.

302
00:19:31,456 --> 00:19:36,867
I think that's a worthwhile place
where I can prove my skills.

303
00:19:39,584 --> 00:19:42,973
I need to respect your decision.

304
00:19:44,505 --> 00:19:47,769
But what am I going to
do about the academy fees?

305
00:19:53,475 --> 00:19:54,980
Whatever...

306
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:59,000
I can take out a loan, or tell Bom
to take money out of her account.

307
00:19:59,923 --> 00:20:02,692
But...

308
00:20:03,984 --> 00:20:07,318
You are going to finish
your training there, right?

309
00:20:07,318 --> 00:20:09,001
Yes, Mother.

310
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:10,873
This will be the last time.

311
00:20:10,873 --> 00:20:12,398
Don't worry.

312
00:20:12,988 --> 00:20:13,841
Okay.

313
00:20:13,841 --> 00:20:16,565
I have faith in you.

314
00:20:17,164 --> 00:20:20,625
You must become a judge
or a prosecutor, okay?

315
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,980
Okay, no matter what.

316
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,199
- I must...
- You must...

317
00:20:37,648 --> 00:20:40,572
He'll definitely finish
the training period this time.

318
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,473
Please find a good match for him.

319
00:20:42,473 --> 00:20:47,488
Of course, we care about her education.
Her husband will be a judge after all.

320
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,004
Of course.

321
00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:01,009
I heard it's on the 10th
floor of this studio building.

322
00:21:06,668 --> 00:21:09,109
It must be there.

323
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:22,698
He's done for today.
Goodbye.

324
00:21:25,095 --> 00:21:27,200
I'm not here to get
my fortunes told.

325
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,496
I have something to say
to that quack, so move!

326
00:21:31,036 --> 00:21:32,937
What's with this girl?
What the heck?

327
00:21:34,552 --> 00:21:36,782
Let's see...

328
00:21:38,816 --> 00:21:41,411
I won't get the job
this time, either?

329
00:21:41,411 --> 00:21:42,873
Don't be disappointed.

330
00:21:42,873 --> 00:21:46,379
If you call upon the spirits,
you'll have no problem getting a job.

331
00:21:46,379 --> 00:21:48,201
What's wrong with you?

332
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,565
Can I get a job too,
if I call upon the spirits?

333
00:21:52,565 --> 00:21:54,973
- This girl just keeps...
- Let go!

334
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,823
Your problem is not
getting a job.

335
00:21:59,823 --> 00:22:01,646
What's the use of making money?

336
00:22:01,646 --> 00:22:03,471
Because of all the men
crowding around you...

337
00:22:03,471 --> 00:22:05,938
You won't be able
to save any money.

338
00:22:05,938 --> 00:22:07,428
You need to appease the spirits.

339
00:22:07,428 --> 00:22:09,549
Men are crowding around me?

340
00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:13,415
I've never had a single boyfriend
in all my life.

341
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,057
I mean after you find a job.

342
00:22:20,057 --> 00:22:21,333
Not now.

343
00:22:23,798 --> 00:22:27,057
I'm the CEO of a laundromat
right now!

344
00:22:27,057 --> 00:22:28,929
- CEO?
- What's this?

345
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:30,979
- He got everything wrong.
- I thought he was good.

346
00:22:30,979 --> 00:22:33,750
This person is a total fraud.

347
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,461
He lies and says that you'll get a job
if you just pay to call upon the spirits.

348
00:22:36,461 --> 00:22:38,790
He's a total crook.

349
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,404
So go before he takes all your money.
Hurry, and get up!

350
00:22:41,404 --> 00:22:44,230
- Hurry, and leave.
- Listen, girls...

351
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,813
Go...
Get out!

352
00:22:46,813 --> 00:22:48,646
Go, go...

353
00:22:49,164 --> 00:22:50,690
What's wrong with you?

354
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:53,726
How dare you walk into my work
place and ruin everything?

355
00:22:55,081 --> 00:22:55,828
Me?

356
00:22:55,828 --> 00:22:57,703
I'm Park Ji Young's friend.

357
00:22:57,703 --> 00:22:59,674
You cheated my friend.

358
00:22:59,674 --> 00:23:02,248
Give me the 10 million won
you took from her right now!

359
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:05,498
Why are you taking it out on me?

360
00:23:05,498 --> 00:23:07,707
It didn't work because
she wasn't being devout enough.

361
00:23:07,707 --> 00:23:08,842
Jerk!

362
00:23:11,774 --> 00:23:15,547
You are nothing but a crook that takes
money from those trying to find jobs.

363
00:23:15,547 --> 00:23:17,413
What did you say?

364
00:23:17,413 --> 00:23:19,903
You should experience how it feels
to get strangled, too.

365
00:23:19,903 --> 00:23:20,965
Min Soo!

366
00:23:21,337 --> 00:23:24,218
This psychopath is going to kill me!

367
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,092
- Die!
- Min Soo!

368
00:23:26,092 --> 00:23:28,002
Let go of this, and talk.

369
00:23:28,002 --> 00:23:30,179
- What's wrong with this woman?
- Mind your business!

370
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:31,639
Jerk!

371
00:23:39,971 --> 00:23:41,567
What are you looking at?

372
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:43,260
Just give me the money!

373
00:23:45,404 --> 00:23:48,519
I wanted to live a quiet life.

374
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:51,980
That jerk!

375
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,443
I should have beaten him up
until he gave me the money.

376
00:23:55,443 --> 00:23:58,014
Still, violence is wrong.

377
00:23:58,572 --> 00:24:02,477
If it's hard to resolve this alone,
why don't you ask for help?

378
00:24:02,477 --> 00:24:03,934
Help?
From who?

379
00:24:03,934 --> 00:24:05,042
Young Mi?

380
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:07,627
No, that artist guy.

381
00:24:07,627 --> 00:24:10,200
Grandma, he's a total baby.

382
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,198
Baby.

383
00:24:11,198 --> 00:24:12,745
He can't help with anything.

384
00:24:12,745 --> 00:24:17,623
They say everything has a use.
He's better than nothing.

385
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,455
I'll think about it.

386
00:24:19,593 --> 00:24:24,939
Anyway, can you give me the power
to look into the future?

387
00:24:24,939 --> 00:24:26,202
Why?

388
00:24:26,202 --> 00:24:28,624
You want to open up a fortune
telling business on the side?

389
00:24:28,624 --> 00:24:30,067
It's not that.

390
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:33,304
I want to let Ji Young know
when she'll find a job.

391
00:24:33,304 --> 00:24:36,360
And I'm a little worried
about Eun Chul, too.

392
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,730
Right...

393
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,658
Tomorrow is the bar exam.

394
00:24:39,658 --> 00:24:40,636
Yeah.

395
00:24:40,636 --> 00:24:46,053
Mom is already calling him 'Judge Kim'
and totally jumping the gun.

396
00:24:46,053 --> 00:24:48,668
I think he's feeling pressured.

397
00:24:48,668 --> 00:24:53,847
I usually can't tell you
but I'll tell you just this once.

398
00:24:58,626 --> 00:24:59,783
Got it?

399
00:24:59,783 --> 00:25:00,528
What?

400
00:25:00,528 --> 00:25:01,880
What did you say?

401
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,203
I didn't hear anything.

402
00:25:03,203 --> 00:25:05,271
I said I would tell you just once.

403
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:08,046
I'll see you again, granddaughter.

404
00:25:08,046 --> 00:25:11,619
How can you do this?
Tell me again before you go...

405
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:12,937
Grandma...

406
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:15,259
She left again.

407
00:25:17,361 --> 00:25:24,255
[Day of the exam, 7:30 AM]

408
00:25:25,834 --> 00:25:27,836
He studied so hard
for the past year.

409
00:25:31,231 --> 00:25:33,834
Eun Chul, get yourself
something good to eat.

410
00:25:39,078 --> 00:25:40,068
What's this?

411
00:25:40,068 --> 00:25:43,221
He's still holding onto the
talisman that Young Mi bought?

412
00:25:44,239 --> 00:25:46,707
He acts all cocky...

413
00:25:46,707 --> 00:25:49,430
But I guess he's got no other
choice when it comes to getting a job.

414
00:25:53,851 --> 00:25:55,026
What were you doing?

415
00:25:55,026 --> 00:25:56,521
Nothing.

416
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,393
You're not going to eat?

417
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:00,735
I don't feel like eating.

418
00:26:00,735 --> 00:26:03,586
Still, you can't go on an empty
stomach to take a test.

419
00:26:03,586 --> 00:26:05,524
I'll make some warm citron tea.

420
00:26:05,524 --> 00:26:06,929
You should drink it before you go.

421
00:26:18,168 --> 00:26:21,481
My hopes and dreams, you've always
done well on even the hardest exams.

422
00:26:21,481 --> 00:26:23,131
I'm not worried at all.

423
00:26:23,131 --> 00:26:26,192
Don't make any mistakes,
and get home when you are done.

424
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:29,913
Eun Chul, I had a really
good dream last night.

425
00:26:29,913 --> 00:26:32,345
I think you'll pass with
flying colors.

426
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:34,047
Okay.

427
00:26:34,645 --> 00:26:35,578
Eun Chul!

428
00:26:36,004 --> 00:26:36,833
Eun Chul...

429
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:38,327
Drink this before you go.

430
00:26:38,327 --> 00:26:40,212
I made it with honey.

431
00:26:40,212 --> 00:26:43,221
Yeah, you should drink something
to warm yourself up.

432
00:26:47,855 --> 00:26:49,376
Wretched girl...

433
00:26:49,376 --> 00:26:52,748
Why the heck did you break the
cup on his exam day?

434
00:26:52,748 --> 00:26:53,971
Why did you do that?

435
00:26:57,167 --> 00:26:58,489
Nice job...

436
00:26:58,489 --> 00:26:59,402
Ki Joon.

437
00:27:04,073 --> 00:27:06,721
Ki Joon, what brings you
here so early in the morning?

438
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:10,517
I came to wish Eun Chul
good luck on the test.

439
00:27:11,393 --> 00:27:12,944
I guess you are busy.

440
00:27:12,944 --> 00:27:14,188
I'm not busy.

441
00:27:14,188 --> 00:27:15,077
Come on in.

442
00:27:15,077 --> 00:27:16,106
Okay.

443
00:27:20,268 --> 00:27:24,389
He saw me getting beat up by
Mom so early in the morning.

444
00:27:25,008 --> 00:27:26,975
How embarrassing.

445
00:27:27,718 --> 00:27:29,804
Bom, wait up!

446
00:27:34,594 --> 00:27:36,146
You're going to work early.

447
00:27:36,146 --> 00:27:37,789
How is the laundry business?

448
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:38,953
Not bad.

449
00:27:39,883 --> 00:27:42,710
That hospital gown you
washed for me...

450
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,504
it became like new.

451
00:27:44,504 --> 00:27:46,513
You've got an expert's touch.

452
00:27:46,513 --> 00:27:49,307
Since I was young,
laundry was a hobby for me.

453
00:27:49,307 --> 00:27:51,962
I'm really good at
taking the stains out.

454
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:53,850
Laundry was your hobby?

455
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,441
That's very unique.

456
00:27:56,064 --> 00:27:58,106
What's your hobby?

457
00:27:58,106 --> 00:28:01,665
I like playing instruments...
and watching movies.

458
00:28:01,665 --> 00:28:04,784
- I like watching movies, too.
- Yeah?

459
00:28:04,784 --> 00:28:06,490
We should go watch a movie
together sometime then.

460
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:08,376
Have a good day!

461
00:28:08,376 --> 00:28:09,469
Wait.

462
00:28:09,866 --> 00:28:11,027
When?

463
00:28:11,027 --> 00:28:14,742
Let's decide the exact date and time
to the second right now.

464
00:28:14,742 --> 00:28:15,693
Now.

465
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:16,865
Right now.

466
00:28:32,433 --> 00:28:33,869
Mrs. Kim.

467
00:28:33,869 --> 00:28:35,937
From a family of
doctors or professors...

468
00:28:35,937 --> 00:28:38,854
Is it so hard to find a doctor,
prosecutor, judge, lawyer...

469
00:28:38,854 --> 00:28:43,295
or high ranking civil servant
who graduated from a top school?

470
00:28:43,295 --> 00:28:46,630
Madame, if the man has all
those qualifications

471
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:49,963
he would be very picky about the girl's
family and education.

472
00:28:49,963 --> 00:28:52,851
What's wrong with our family?

473
00:28:52,851 --> 00:28:56,182
And Young Mi may not
have gone to college, but...

474
00:28:57,671 --> 00:28:59,394
Mrs. Kim.

475
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:03,287
Mrs. Kim, why is it so hard
to get in contact with you?

476
00:29:05,586 --> 00:29:09,588
Did you have a chance to find
a good match for Eun Chul?

477
00:29:12,492 --> 00:29:16,706
Excuse me, Mrs. Kim is
talking to me right now.

478
00:29:16,706 --> 00:29:18,588
Why are you being so mannerless?

479
00:29:18,588 --> 00:29:20,023
Is that so?

480
00:29:20,023 --> 00:29:21,583
I'm sorry.

481
00:29:21,583 --> 00:29:25,382
I'll mind my manners, and
just talk to her for one minute.

482
00:29:25,382 --> 00:29:27,693
Did you find a good match?

483
00:29:27,693 --> 00:29:29,763
I'll make sure to reward you.

484
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:33,286
Yes!
This works out.

485
00:29:33,286 --> 00:29:35,615
This is exactly what you've
been wanting.

486
00:29:35,615 --> 00:29:40,361
Her son graduated from Seoul University
and he will soon pass the bar exam.

487
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,936
That's great.

488
00:29:41,936 --> 00:29:43,555
This must be fate.

489
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,534
Not all law school students become
prosecutors and judges.

490
00:29:49,534 --> 00:29:51,795
How can you try to match
my daughter to that bum?

491
00:29:51,795 --> 00:29:53,148
He's so low class.

492
00:29:53,912 --> 00:29:57,352
How dare you call my
precious son a bum?

493
00:29:57,352 --> 00:29:58,478
Oh my...

494
00:29:59,343 --> 00:30:03,043
Your temper hasn't changed
at all since then.

495
00:30:03,043 --> 00:30:05,035
Not changed since then?

496
00:30:05,711 --> 00:30:07,879
I know I've seen this woman before.

497
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:11,196
We saw each other nine years
ago inside

498
00:30:11,196 --> 00:30:13,544
the conference room at
Culture Girl's High School.

499
00:30:13,544 --> 00:30:17,090
Your daughter was such a bad
influence on my daughter.

500
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,828
She got suspended because of her.

501
00:30:19,538 --> 00:30:20,759
So upsetting...

502
00:30:21,693 --> 00:30:24,449
Yeah. Now that I look at you,
you are that nasty woman.

503
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:26,173
Let's only speak the truth.

504
00:30:26,173 --> 00:30:28,381
Everyone knows that Young Mi
was the school thug.

505
00:30:28,381 --> 00:30:31,318
- Who was the bad influence on whom?
- What did you say?

506
00:30:31,318 --> 00:30:33,980
- That's such nonsense...
- And...

507
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:36,532
I would never marry my son off
to a low class

508
00:30:36,532 --> 00:30:39,085
loan shark family even if it means
he'll never get married.

509
00:30:39,085 --> 00:30:40,187
Stop dreaming.

510
00:30:40,187 --> 00:30:41,925
Why are you doing this?

511
00:30:42,554 --> 00:30:44,428
Loan shark family?

512
00:30:44,428 --> 00:30:47,218
Low class?

513
00:30:47,728 --> 00:30:52,278
Our family financially backed the Korean
army during the Japanese occupation.

514
00:30:52,278 --> 00:30:53,815
We are a respected family.

515
00:30:53,815 --> 00:30:54,855
...

516
00:30:54,855 --> 00:30:58,281
Is that why your daughter walks
around, collecting

517
00:30:58,281 --> 00:31:01,709
money wearing a skirt the size
of my hand?

518
00:31:02,413 --> 00:31:03,844
What the heck...

519
00:31:03,844 --> 00:31:05,359
How disrespectful...

520
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:08,318
Are you insulting
my baby's style?

521
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:16,576
Honey...

522
00:31:16,576 --> 00:31:20,538
Something really bad happened to me.

523
00:31:21,153 --> 00:31:23,818
Yeah, come pick me up.

524
00:31:23,818 --> 00:31:25,250
Okay.

525
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,111
Okay.

526
00:31:28,112 --> 00:31:29,709
What the heck.

527
00:31:30,405 --> 00:31:31,770
Mrs. Kim...

528
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:36,877
I will never become an in-law with
that family, please find another girl.

529
00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:39,937
I can't believe her...

530
00:31:43,795 --> 00:31:46,057
Honey, where are you?

531
00:32:12,946 --> 00:32:16,697
<i>Why is my stomach
hurting all of a sudden?</i>

532
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,365
<i>No.</i>

533
00:32:19,413 --> 00:32:20,999
<i>Get a hold of yourself, Kim Eun Chul.</i>

534
00:32:20,999 --> 00:32:22,376
<i>Get a hold of yourself.</i>

535
00:32:24,669 --> 00:32:28,625
<i>I'll have to take out a loan, or tell
Bom to take money out of her account.</i>

536
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,946
<i>This is the last time.</i>

537
00:32:39,946 --> 00:32:41,500
<i>Don't worry.</i>

538
00:33:01,317 --> 00:33:03,985
<i>I have faith in you.</i>

539
00:33:05,457 --> 00:33:09,421
<i>You must become a judge
or a prosecutor, okay?</i>

540
00:33:13,016 --> 00:33:14,219
Hey!

541
00:33:14,219 --> 00:33:15,297
Are you okay?

542
00:33:15,297 --> 00:33:17,168
Get a hold of yourself!
Look here!

543
00:33:17,798 --> 00:33:18,771
Hello?

544
00:33:18,771 --> 00:33:19,985
Hey!

545
00:33:20,451 --> 00:33:21,377
Hey!

546
00:33:24,715 --> 00:33:27,328
Her phone is turned off.

547
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:30,390
Did Park Ji Young come
out to work today?

548
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:31,561
Yes.

549
00:33:31,853 --> 00:33:33,268
Do you know where she is?

550
00:33:33,268 --> 00:33:36,715
She was sitting alone on top
of the building steps awhile ago.

551
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:38,427
I don't know about now.

552
00:33:39,186 --> 00:33:41,672
It's almost time for her shift.
I wonder where she went...

553
00:33:42,251 --> 00:33:43,873
Okay, thank you.

554
00:33:54,268 --> 00:33:55,603
[Will]

555
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:00,410
Ji Young!

556
00:34:07,658 --> 00:34:08,729
No!

557
00:34:09,891 --> 00:34:11,734
Don't come near me.

558
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:16,484
Ji Young, why are you doing this?
Don't do this.

559
00:34:16,484 --> 00:34:18,783
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?

560
00:34:22,422 --> 00:34:25,059
It's not like I don't
understand how you feel.

561
00:34:25,059 --> 00:34:27,073
But this isn't right.

562
00:34:27,073 --> 00:34:29,019
Think about your
mom and sister.

563
00:34:29,646 --> 00:34:30,586
No.

564
00:34:30,979 --> 00:34:36,327
If I want to help my mom and sister,
I need to disappear.

565
00:34:36,853 --> 00:34:38,404
Ji Young.

566
00:34:40,514 --> 00:34:45,668
The loan sharks went to look
for my mom at her work this morning.

567
00:34:47,027 --> 00:34:49,358
She was so shocked, she fainted.

568
00:34:50,801 --> 00:34:54,302
If I die, at least she won't
have to pay back the loan.

569
00:34:54,742 --> 00:34:57,448
I have a way to get that money back.

570
00:34:57,448 --> 00:35:01,010
So, don't do this scary thing.

571
00:35:02,384 --> 00:35:04,077
Please just trust me.

572
00:35:04,077 --> 00:35:08,132
I'll make sure you get
all your money back.

573
00:35:09,447 --> 00:35:12,215
So, please come down.

574
00:35:12,215 --> 00:35:13,826
It's too dangerous.

575
00:35:24,701 --> 00:35:26,314
Are you okay?

576
00:35:28,349 --> 00:35:29,818
Let's go.

577
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,189
Let go of me!
I need to go.

578
00:35:44,003 --> 00:35:45,914
Calm down.
You can't go.

579
00:35:45,914 --> 00:35:47,001
Let go!

580
00:35:47,001 --> 00:35:50,047
- I need to go in to take the exam.
- Calm down.

581
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:51,783
You can't go in during the exam.

582
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:53,300
That's the rule.

583
00:35:57,007 --> 00:36:00,081
This exam means
everything to me...

584
00:36:00,798 --> 00:36:03,251
I can't give up like this.

585
00:36:06,256 --> 00:36:08,396
I can't give up!

586
00:36:10,256 --> 00:36:12,509
I need to take that exam.

587
00:36:16,818 --> 00:36:18,818
I bet he won't even give
me back a penny.

588
00:36:18,818 --> 00:36:21,243
How am I going to get him
to give me 10 million won?

589
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,305
This mouth is the problem.

590
00:36:23,305 --> 00:36:26,189
So why did you make
such a bold claim?

591
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,648
What else could I do?
I had to save her life first.

592
00:36:33,682 --> 00:36:37,880
She even wrote out her will, and she
was about to jump from the rooftop.

593
00:36:40,838 --> 00:36:42,162
What do I do?

594
00:36:42,162 --> 00:36:44,671
It's no use suing that quack.

595
00:36:44,671 --> 00:36:46,945
Of course, you don't have
10 million won, right?

596
00:36:46,945 --> 00:36:49,692
Should I borrow it from Young Mi?

597
00:36:49,692 --> 00:36:53,502
But why are you so fervently
trying to help this customer?

598
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,207
You know her?

599
00:36:55,657 --> 00:36:56,586
Huh?

600
00:36:58,073 --> 00:37:00,579
Yeah, I know her.

601
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,416
You see...

602
00:37:02,416 --> 00:37:05,912
She's my friend's in-law's
cousin's sister.

603
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,841
If it's that close...

604
00:37:09,235 --> 00:37:10,858
you should definitely
help her out.

605
00:37:11,384 --> 00:37:15,530
The best thing would be to make
that quack cough up the money himself.

606
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:19,070
I know.

607
00:37:27,461 --> 00:37:30,224
I have a good idea.

608
00:37:42,615 --> 00:37:43,983
Hey!

609
00:37:43,983 --> 00:37:45,382
Let's do that right now.

610
00:37:45,382 --> 00:37:46,764
Let's go.

611
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:47,876
Let's go...

612
00:37:59,023 --> 00:38:02,296
I'm almost finished with
taking care of my son.

613
00:38:02,296 --> 00:38:04,155
I made him into a judge.

614
00:38:04,155 --> 00:38:07,376
It would be perfect if I can
get a doctor daughter-in-law.

615
00:38:12,032 --> 00:38:14,604
I'm getting so annoyed
thinking about it.

616
00:38:14,604 --> 00:38:17,713
How dare she try to match him
up with a daughter of a loan shark.

617
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:20,198
Wait until Eun Chul becomes a judge...

618
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:24,342
I'll get him to investigate that family,
and punish them!

619
00:38:27,832 --> 00:38:29,831
The rice is ready.

620
00:38:29,831 --> 00:38:31,838
Let's see...
What time is it?

621
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:33,394
Oh my God.

622
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:36,694
It's almost time for my
hopes and dreams to come home.

623
00:38:36,694 --> 00:38:38,309
Rib eye roll...
Rib eye roll...

624
00:38:38,309 --> 00:38:39,940
Rib eye roll!

625
00:38:42,185 --> 00:38:45,684
Yeah, I'm on my way to deposit
the money we got today.

626
00:38:45,684 --> 00:38:47,452
Okay, I'll see you there.

627
00:38:48,457 --> 00:38:49,677
Nice.

628
00:38:58,692 --> 00:39:00,831
<i>You can't go in during the exam.</i>

629
00:39:00,831 --> 00:39:02,390
<i>That's the rule.</i>

630
00:39:19,673 --> 00:39:20,591
Son!

631
00:39:24,148 --> 00:39:26,826
You shouldn't have come out,
it's so cold.

632
00:39:26,826 --> 00:39:29,993
Son, of course I should come out
when you just took that exam.

633
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,662
You went through so
much in this cold.

634
00:39:31,662 --> 00:39:32,386
Right...

635
00:39:33,082 --> 00:39:35,291
Did you do well on the exam?

636
00:39:37,305 --> 00:39:38,439
Of course.

637
00:39:38,439 --> 00:39:40,865
I don't even need to wait
for the results from the first round.

638
00:39:40,865 --> 00:39:42,983
I'm going to start preparing
for the second round right away.

639
00:39:42,983 --> 00:39:45,461
Of course, Judge Kim.

640
00:39:45,461 --> 00:39:46,440
Right...

641
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,182
I wanted to nourish your body...

642
00:39:49,182 --> 00:39:52,208
So I went and bought
some rib eye rolls.

643
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:53,604
Let's go.

644
00:40:04,529 --> 00:40:07,863
I didn't know it would be this
easy to fool people when we started.

645
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:10,630
It's best to target those
who are in despair.

646
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:14,961
Yeah! But don't you think we've
stayed too long in one location?

647
00:40:14,961 --> 00:40:17,813
I think we might get caught for fraud,
we should move to a different region.

648
00:40:17,813 --> 00:40:19,497
- We should.
- Yeah.

649
00:40:19,497 --> 00:40:22,987
I don't feel good about that girl,
Park Ji Young, catching onto us.

650
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:24,822
- I don't have a good feeling about it.
- Let's go.

651
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:28,778
It's you again?

652
00:40:29,416 --> 00:40:32,121
I can't return her money.

653
00:40:32,121 --> 00:40:36,706
And tell that girl,
Park Ji Young, or whatever...

654
00:40:36,706 --> 00:40:39,038
She should sue us
if she feels wronged.

655
00:40:39,038 --> 00:40:39,860
Sue?

656
00:40:40,362 --> 00:40:42,314
She can't do that even if
she wants to.

657
00:40:43,104 --> 00:40:44,445
My friend...

658
00:40:46,331 --> 00:40:47,689
She died.

659
00:40:49,033 --> 00:40:52,211
Because of the loans she took out
to pay you...

660
00:40:52,211 --> 00:40:56,800
she threw herself into the
river in her hometown.

661
00:40:57,693 --> 00:40:59,494
When was that?

662
00:40:59,494 --> 00:41:00,724
Last night!

663
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:04,121
How could this happen?

664
00:41:05,036 --> 00:41:06,608
- That was her will.
- Will?

665
00:41:09,613 --> 00:41:11,224
Mother, I'm sorry.

666
00:41:11,224 --> 00:41:13,326
I'm sorry, my sister, Ji Hee.

667
00:41:13,326 --> 00:41:17,971
I won't let that fortune teller
get off easy for doing this to me.

668
00:41:17,971 --> 00:41:21,587
I'm going to get my revenge
on him in my death.

669
00:41:23,137 --> 00:41:24,597
What do we do?

670
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:29,215
Hey, are you trying to
threaten us with this?

671
00:41:29,818 --> 00:41:31,903
You killed an innocent person.

672
00:41:31,903 --> 00:41:33,992
I can't let you sleep
in comfort.

673
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:36,168
I didn't kill anyone!

674
00:41:36,667 --> 00:41:40,121
Return that money to Ji Young's
mom right now.

675
00:41:40,121 --> 00:41:41,591
Otherwise...

676
00:41:42,195 --> 00:41:46,463
my friend's restless spirit
will put a curse on you.

677
00:41:52,518 --> 00:41:55,457
Hey, something's weird here.

678
00:41:56,198 --> 00:41:57,586
What?

679
00:41:57,586 --> 00:41:58,684
I mean...

680
00:41:58,684 --> 00:42:03,063
She said the girl died last night,
but she called early this morning.

681
00:42:03,063 --> 00:42:05,390
She was crying and asking back
for the money.

682
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,046
I'm sure you are mistaken.

683
00:42:07,046 --> 00:42:08,911
Did you fall asleep drunk last night?

684
00:42:08,911 --> 00:42:10,554
No, this is weird.

685
00:42:10,554 --> 00:42:13,313
Let's give back all that money,
and go back to our hometown.

686
00:42:13,313 --> 00:42:14,497
Shut up.

687
00:42:14,497 --> 00:42:16,448
There are no such things as ghosts.

688
00:42:16,448 --> 00:42:18,065
Stop talking nonsense.

689
00:42:18,065 --> 00:42:20,481
Look for a new house
for us to move into tomorrow.

690
00:42:27,005 --> 00:42:28,626
Feels so crummy...

691
00:42:28,626 --> 00:42:31,345
I should be careful who I
cheat in the future.

692
00:42:36,751 --> 00:42:38,606
Is the lightbulb out?

693
00:42:38,606 --> 00:42:41,467
I told him to change the bulb.

694
00:42:45,619 --> 00:42:46,394
Cold!

695
00:42:46,725 --> 00:42:50,279
Seriously, why is there water here?

696
00:42:50,279 --> 00:42:52,640
I told Min Soo to clean
up before leaving.

697
00:42:53,284 --> 00:42:54,923
Let's see...

698
00:42:55,305 --> 00:42:57,655
Where's that towel?

699
00:43:02,122 --> 00:43:04,024
What's this?

700
00:43:04,451 --> 00:43:06,332
They're footsteps.

701
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:12,786
<i>She left a will last night,
and threw herself into the river.</i>

702
00:43:14,443 --> 00:43:15,484
No way...

703
00:43:15,484 --> 00:43:17,009
No way.

704
00:43:17,474 --> 00:43:20,492
Min Soo probably just left
in the middle of cleaning up.

705
00:43:21,827 --> 00:43:23,201
I should change.

706
00:43:56,328 --> 00:43:57,521
Let's go.

707
00:44:03,555 --> 00:44:05,171
[I'll get my revenge.]

708
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,123
Cellphone!

709
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:15,256
Cellphone...

710
00:44:15,532 --> 00:44:17,065
Why isn't this turning on?

711
00:44:17,065 --> 00:44:19,315
Why isn't the power
turning on?

712
00:44:23,569 --> 00:44:25,032
What's this?

713
00:44:27,087 --> 00:44:30,480
Please turn off...

714
00:44:31,309 --> 00:44:32,595
Turn off.

715
00:44:32,595 --> 00:44:34,708
Please turn off.

716
00:44:41,974 --> 00:44:43,934
What's this?

717
00:44:44,604 --> 00:44:46,251
Why isn't the door opening?

718
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,251
Min Soo?

719
00:44:49,546 --> 00:44:50,735
Min Soo?

720
00:44:50,735 --> 00:44:52,202
Is it Min Soo?

721
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:58,634
<i>Even if it's in my death,
I'm going to get</i>

722
00:44:58,634 --> 00:45:01,126
<i>revenge on the one who did this to me.</i>

723
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:05,916
<i>My friend's restless spirit
will put a curse on you.</i>

724
00:45:12,822 --> 00:45:15,810
He won't be able to do anything
bad ever again.

725
00:45:16,355 --> 00:45:18,385
What a tragic end
to a crook...

726
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:20,596
He's getting what he deserves.

727
00:45:30,024 --> 00:45:33,710
Thanks to you, I was able to
get all my money back.

728
00:45:34,396 --> 00:45:37,505
It's not easy to help out
someone you hardly know.

729
00:45:37,505 --> 00:45:40,671
I don't know how to thank you.

730
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:41,657
No...

731
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:43,389
That bastard...

732
00:45:44,823 --> 00:45:49,025
Those crooks need to
be taught a lesson.

733
00:45:49,462 --> 00:45:53,305
That way, there won't be
any more victims like you, Ji Young.

734
00:45:53,305 --> 00:45:54,265
Yeah.

735
00:45:54,265 --> 00:45:58,921
You were probably freaked out
to pretend that you were dead...

736
00:45:58,921 --> 00:46:02,756
And I'm sure it felt strange
giving me your will...

737
00:46:02,756 --> 00:46:05,336
I'm sorry for asking you
to do those things.

738
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:08,498
Don't worry about that.

739
00:46:08,498 --> 00:46:13,811
If it weren't for you, I would never
have been able to get back on my feet.

740
00:46:14,298 --> 00:46:15,229
Right...

741
00:46:22,465 --> 00:46:24,951
I finished dry cleaning your clothes.

742
00:46:24,951 --> 00:46:27,260
You said you have
an interview today.

743
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:29,435
You should wear this.

744
00:46:29,435 --> 00:46:31,347
Thank you.

745
00:46:31,347 --> 00:46:33,127
I'll get going.

746
00:46:33,127 --> 00:46:34,545
Good luck on your interview.

747
00:46:34,545 --> 00:46:36,243
Ji Young, fighting!

748
00:46:38,756 --> 00:46:39,654
Bye.

749
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:43,282
Bye.

750
00:47:16,494 --> 00:47:17,934
Pretty...

751
00:47:25,412 --> 00:47:29,952
I'm sure if I wear black stockings,
it'll cover up the burn scars.

752
00:47:36,121 --> 00:47:40,229
This is a perfect outfit to wear on a
movie date with the man of your dreams.

753
00:47:58,481 --> 00:48:00,975
This would be perfect for Bom.

754
00:48:00,975 --> 00:48:02,488
Should I get it for her?

755
00:48:03,488 --> 00:48:04,393
No...

756
00:48:04,932 --> 00:48:07,052
You are not her boyfriend,
Yong Soo Chul.

757
00:48:07,532 --> 00:48:09,131
Stop overdoing it.

758
00:48:22,623 --> 00:48:23,693
Ki Joon.

759
00:48:32,885 --> 00:48:34,956
Who's she?

760
00:48:41,243 --> 00:48:42,215
Bom!

761
00:48:46,724 --> 00:48:48,515
You came early.

762
00:48:48,515 --> 00:48:49,573
Yeah.

763
00:48:54,596 --> 00:48:56,898
I'm sorry for not
letting you know earlier.

764
00:48:56,898 --> 00:48:59,394
My girlfriend really
wanted to see this movie.

765
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:01,914
I brought her out
so I can introduce her to you, too.

766
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:08,623
I heard a lot about you
from Ki Joon.

767
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:11,307
I'm Yoo Min Young.

768
00:49:15,457 --> 00:49:16,465
Bom?

769
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,676
Bom.

770
00:49:21,235 --> 00:49:22,516
Huh?

771
00:49:23,215 --> 00:49:25,488
It's nice to meet you.

772
00:49:28,516 --> 00:49:30,003
Yes.

773
00:49:32,733 --> 00:49:35,087
Let's go in.
It's time.

774
00:49:35,087 --> 00:49:36,444
Wait.

775
00:49:38,148 --> 00:49:40,528
I just remembered.

776
00:49:40,528 --> 00:49:45,984
I... left the stove on at home.

777
00:49:45,984 --> 00:49:47,969
I should hurry back.

778
00:49:47,969 --> 00:49:49,849
Nobody's home?

779
00:49:49,849 --> 00:49:52,180
No, nobody's home.

780
00:49:52,703 --> 00:49:54,356
I should hurry back.

781
00:49:55,006 --> 00:49:56,739
I'm sorry.

782
00:50:02,193 --> 00:50:03,414
Bom...

783
00:50:05,025 --> 00:50:07,452
Bom, we should watch
a movie next time.

784
00:50:20,382 --> 00:50:22,619
Watch where you are going.

785
00:50:24,804 --> 00:50:26,202
Bom!

786
00:50:27,306 --> 00:50:29,042
Bom, are you okay?

787
00:50:34,007 --> 00:50:36,192
Watch where you are going.

788
00:50:38,634 --> 00:50:39,699
Bom!

789
00:50:40,577 --> 00:50:42,545
Bom, are you okay?

790
00:50:48,264 --> 00:50:49,881
Bom!

791
00:51:07,948 --> 00:51:09,483
How can you do this?

792
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,243
<i>You want me to look
for their couple ring?</i>

793
00:51:11,243 --> 00:51:12,969
<i>You are so cruel, Grandma.</i>

794
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:14,793
I feel so bad for him.

795
00:51:14,793 --> 00:51:16,621
He's wandering around,
not able to tell

796
00:51:16,621 --> 00:51:18,448
<i>his family that he messed up
on the exam...</i>

797
00:51:18,448 --> 00:51:19,737
What are you doing?

798
00:51:19,737 --> 00:51:22,412
<i>Why do you want to know so much?
It has nothing to do with you.</i>

799
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,354
Butt out.

800
00:51:23,354 --> 00:51:25,768
How can I butt out
when I like you?

801
00:51:25,768 --> 00:51:27,207
- Baby...
- Hey!

802
00:51:27,207 --> 00:51:29,028
Where's my son?

803
00:51:29,028 --> 00:51:30,337
Stop right there.

804
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:33,185
<i>You can't make someone
like you.</i>

805
00:51:33,185 --> 00:51:34,911
<i>I don't know who will be
in your fate...</i>

806
00:51:34,911 --> 00:51:37,251
<i>But don't hope for another's
love to suffer</i>

807
00:51:37,251 --> 00:51:39,590
<i>just because your own love hurts.</i>
