- I don't know.

34
00:03:24,016 --> 00:03:25,642
Somebody said he broke his back.

35
00:03:25,852 --> 00:03:27,644
- My, how'd he do that?

36
00:03:33,943 --> 00:03:36,319
- Cycles is a mean toy, lady.

37
00:03:40,408 --> 00:03:41,825
- [Voiceover] Wait a minute, who's that?

38
00:03:42,034 --> 00:03:43,660
Get that man off the course out there.

39
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,746
Hey Ray, get that guy off the course.

40
00:03:45,955 --> 00:03:47,289
There's no walkin' on the course.

- You let Little look at it!

51

If it's broke, he'll fix it good.

Comes to anything mechanical,
Little's all but hear me.

53
00:04:49,352 --> 00:04:50,268
- Get these things on that bike.

54
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:51,770
Get off the track now, move it.

That was good, son.

61
00:05:10,873 --> 00:05:12,791
- Oh, the buzzer's gone and got ya.

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,293
- Did you see me waving?

63
00:05:15,503 --> 00:05:17,754
- I was going as fast as I
ever went in my whole life

64
00:05:17,964 --> 00:05:18,797
and then I fell off.

65
00:05:19,006 --> 00:05:19,965
- Well, you go too fast.

66
00:05:20,174 --> 00:05:21,383
You stay on, you win.

67
00:05:21,592 --> 00:05:22,425
That's how you win.

68
00:05:22,635 --> 00:05:24,010
You gotta stay on.

69
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:26,346
- What's that? Movies?

70
00:05:26,556 --> 00:05:27,848
- Come on, now. Hurry!

71
00:05:28,057 --> 00:05:30,350
- Aw, ma, don't bother that fella.

72
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,728
- I told him we'd pay him
if it turns out any good.

73
00:05:33,938 --> 00:05:35,105
- Just me and my bike?

74
00:05:35,314 --> 00:05:37,607
- (chuckles) Sure, Little.

75
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:39,860
Hey, what do you think of my boy anyways

76
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:42,320
that sleeps in his room
with his own motorcycle.

77
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,905
- Just one for the mantel.

78
00:05:44,115 --> 00:05:45,282
That's all I want.

79
00:05:45,491 --> 00:05:47,033
We haven't got a single picture

80
00:05:47,243 --> 00:05:49,119
on the whole mantlepiece, Seal.

81
00:05:49,328 --> 00:05:52,080
- Hey, is that one of
them instant machines?

82
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,165
- I'll get your address.

83
00:05:55,334 --> 00:05:56,835
All right now, now hold it.

84
00:05:57,044 --> 00:05:57,961
Stay loose as a goose.

85
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,338
That's it, that's it. Relax, relax.

86
00:06:00,548 --> 00:06:01,923
That's it, hold it.

87
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:03,967
- Life's too short, Donnie.

88
00:06:04,176 --> 00:06:07,846
- (chuckles) Someone's had herself a brew.

89
00:06:08,055 --> 00:06:09,514
- Goes by too damn fast.

90
00:06:09,724 --> 00:06:10,891
- Yeah.

91
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,142
- Keep it there, keep it there.

92
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:14,060
Now let's see that great big smile.

93
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,438
Hold it, hold it, that's it.

94
00:06:16,647 --> 00:06:17,397
You got it.

95
00:06:17,607 --> 00:06:18,523
Oh, that's perfect. That's beautiful.

96
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:19,482
That's lovely.

97
00:06:19,692 --> 00:06:20,692
I like it.

98
00:06:20,902 --> 00:06:23,612
- Give the man our address, dopey.

99
00:06:24,739 --> 00:06:25,989
- I can get it off your facility.

100
00:06:26,198 --> 00:06:27,532
- Oh, no, no, I insist.

101
00:06:27,742 --> 00:06:30,368
Here, you take one of my business cards.

102
00:06:30,578 --> 00:06:33,121
- I told him the day he
starts bringing his work home

103
00:06:33,331 --> 00:06:34,623
is the day I move out.

104
00:06:34,832 --> 00:06:36,499
- Now you can laugh at
me if ya'll want to,

105
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:38,126
but it's a fact I ain't had a stool

106
00:06:38,336 --> 00:06:39,920
since I've been in portable potties.

107
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:41,004
That's a fact.

108
00:06:41,213 --> 00:06:44,215
I want, no, I want you to read that, see.

109
00:06:44,425 --> 00:06:45,634
Portable potties.

110
00:06:45,843 --> 00:06:46,760
P.P.

111
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:49,429
P.P. (laughs) You get that?

112
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:50,764
Mom thought of that one.

113
00:06:50,973 --> 00:06:53,600
- I did not, Seally Fauss (laughs).

114
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:55,393
- I was going as fast as I ever went

115
00:06:55,603 --> 00:06:57,062
in my whole entire life.

116
00:06:57,271 --> 00:06:58,647
- Yeah, but you fell off.

117
00:06:58,856 --> 00:07:00,106
- Yeah, I fell off.

118
00:07:00,316 --> 00:07:02,359
- Try and stay on, son.

119
00:07:02,568 --> 00:07:03,276
Try.

120
00:07:04,236 --> 00:07:06,947
(spluttering car engine)

121
00:07:07,156 --> 00:07:08,198
- Oh, come on.

122
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:11,618
Damn!

123
00:07:11,827 --> 00:07:12,953
- Careful now, Little.

124
00:07:13,162 --> 00:07:15,080
You don't wanna put no scratches on 'em.

125
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:17,958
- Hey, how about you guys
give us a little push, okay?

126
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:20,168
- We happen to be a little busy.

127
00:07:20,378 --> 00:07:22,045
- Oh, hell, sure, take your time.

128
00:07:22,254 --> 00:07:23,380
- [Seally] Come on now, son.

129
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:26,216
Push just, just a little further.

130
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:27,717
Are you pushing any?

131
00:07:27,927 --> 00:07:29,219
- [Little Fauss] Doing the best I can.

132
00:07:29,428 --> 00:07:30,553
- [Seally] These potties,
they seem like they's

133
00:07:30,763 --> 00:07:31,554
more trouble than they's worth.

134
00:07:31,764 --> 00:07:32,639
- [Big Halsy] Me and the
wife come down from Mendoza.

135
00:07:32,848 --> 00:07:34,224
Dang thing cutting out
on me every five minutes.

136
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:35,558
Now the dang thing won't even start.

137
00:07:35,768 --> 00:07:38,186
My wife's getting hotter than hell.

138
00:07:38,396 --> 00:07:39,562
She's expecting a steak dinner tonight.

139
00:07:39,772 --> 00:07:41,398
I said, ''Honey, you just cool
on down 'cause those folks

140
00:07:41,607 --> 00:07:45,610
''over there's gonna
give us a little push.''

141
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,946
Hey, you got all your beer locked up?

142
00:07:48,155 --> 00:07:49,948
- I don't sell no beer.

143
00:07:51,367 --> 00:07:54,160
- You can go load your bike now.

144
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,830
- Sure like to buy ya'll a beer, damnit.

145
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,081
- Sideburned son of a--

146
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,332
- Now don't get riled, Seally.

147
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:01,126
- Well, he can just go straight to hell

148
00:08:01,335 --> 00:08:03,044
with his flair for all I care.

149
00:08:03,254 --> 00:08:04,504
- Well, they'll be stranded.

150
00:08:04,714 --> 00:08:08,758
- Well, I ain't giving no
hand to no undesirables.

151
00:08:10,511 --> 00:08:11,970
- Got a cigarette?

152
00:08:14,181 --> 00:08:15,473
- I don't smoke.

153
00:08:17,268 --> 00:08:18,518
- Ah, damn.

154
00:08:18,728 --> 00:08:22,355
Just gave my last cigarette away, damnit.

155
00:08:22,565 --> 00:08:25,442
Just spent my last two bucks
getting here today, damnit.

156
00:08:25,651 --> 00:08:27,819
(spits) Blew my pickup coming on over

157
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:30,113
and then burned out my bike in the trial

158
00:08:30,322 --> 00:08:32,449
so I didn't win nothing,
then I lost my sponsor

159
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:34,117
if I'd had any luck, which I didn't have,

160
00:08:34,326 --> 00:08:37,203
so now I don't even have a smoke.

161
00:08:37,413 --> 00:08:39,122
- [Seally] You ready, son?

162
00:08:39,331 --> 00:08:41,082
- This guy wants a push, Dad.

163
00:08:41,292 --> 00:08:45,336
- Hey, just a little shove's
all I need to get her going.

164
00:08:56,932 --> 00:08:58,308
Hey, how about a push?

165
00:08:58,517 --> 00:08:59,559
What the hell?

166
00:09:02,063 --> 00:09:05,023
Come on, hey, I need a push, damnit!

167
00:09:10,946 --> 00:09:13,656
(whistling wind)

168
00:09:19,163 --> 00:09:21,247
- Let's have a nice, big smile.

169
00:09:21,457 --> 00:09:22,082
Come on.

170
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:22,999
Ice cream!

171
00:09:25,252 --> 00:09:26,127
Oh, that's great.

172
00:09:26,337 --> 00:09:27,587
Hold it.

173
00:09:27,797 --> 00:09:29,339
Hey, that was a number one.

174
00:09:29,548 --> 00:09:30,965
That's really good, you
want to take another one?

175
00:09:31,175 --> 00:09:32,258
- Hey, how about a beer? You want a beer?

176
00:09:32,468 --> 00:09:33,718
- Oh, sure, sure.

177
00:09:33,928 --> 00:09:35,678
- Hey, god damn, I forgot my wallet.

178
00:09:35,888 --> 00:09:36,971
It's in the pickup.

179
00:09:37,181 --> 00:09:39,099
- Oh, well here.

180
00:09:39,308 --> 00:09:40,266
- I'll catch ya.

181
00:09:40,476 --> 00:09:41,267
I'll catch you later.

182
00:09:41,477 --> 00:09:42,936
You remember. Okay.

183
00:09:46,023 --> 00:09:47,607
Give me three beers.

184
00:09:49,318 --> 00:09:50,693
Man, you was really
working out there today.

185
00:09:50,903 --> 00:09:53,738
Cranked around them
corners with the big boys.

186
00:09:53,948 --> 00:09:55,532
- [Voiceover] You race today?

187
00:09:55,741 --> 00:09:57,117
- (laughs) On that dumbass course?

188
00:09:57,326 --> 00:09:58,326
Not me, buddy.

189
00:09:58,536 --> 00:09:59,828
- [Voiceover] Didn't think
I'd seen you out there.

190
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:01,162
- Hey man, what class you race?

191
00:10:01,372 --> 00:10:03,623
- You'd have seen me, babe,
I'd have had you to the fence.

192
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,125
- What class you race, man?

193
00:10:05,334 --> 00:10:07,001
- Hey, give me three steaks too, huh?

194
00:10:07,211 --> 00:10:09,379
And put it on my tab. My manager's got it.

195
00:10:09,588 --> 00:10:10,630
- [Voiceover] Who in the hell is that?

196
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,299
- That's the cat who got
suspended out of Ascot.

197
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:15,969
Boozin' it up in the pits, man.

198
00:10:19,515 --> 00:10:21,808
- The ol' bubble for the system.

199
00:10:22,017 --> 00:10:23,017
You.

200
00:10:23,227 --> 00:10:24,310
Oh, damnit!

201
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,311
I forgot your change.

202
00:10:25,521 --> 00:10:28,898
- Oh oh oh, that's all
right, that's all right.

203
00:10:29,108 --> 00:10:30,108
- Hey, where was I at?

204
00:10:30,317 --> 00:10:32,443
- You were gonna tell me
how you broke your spine.

205
00:10:32,653 --> 00:10:34,070
Which is what first caught my eye.

206
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,989
- And to this day I can't sleep in a bed.

207
00:10:36,198 --> 00:10:39,742
- Hell, man, where do
you sleep, on the floor?

208
00:10:39,952 --> 00:10:42,162
- That's right, that's
where. On the floor.

209
00:10:42,371 --> 00:10:44,372
- Must make it pretty on little lady here.

210
00:10:44,582 --> 00:10:45,206
- What?

211
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,417
- I mean, if your husband's
sleeping on the floor all night.

212
00:10:47,626 --> 00:10:51,171
What I mean is that (chuckles)
must be pretty hard on you.

213
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,005
- Him?

214
00:10:52,214 --> 00:10:53,339
- Well, it would on me.

215
00:10:53,549 --> 00:10:57,594
- I haven't seen the floor since
I met him, much less a bed.

216
00:10:58,846 --> 00:11:01,222
The whole two weeks we've been in love.

217
00:11:01,432 --> 00:11:02,765
- We've been sleeping in the car.

218
00:11:02,975 --> 00:11:05,810
- Oh, then you two aren't married then.

219
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,146
- No, this is my buddy,
this is my bosom-buddy.

220
00:11:08,355 --> 00:11:10,190
Aren't ya, honey? Some him your bosoms.

221
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,192
- Hey, well. (chuckles)

222
00:11:12,401 --> 00:11:14,986
Why don't I just get a
room out here then and uh,

223
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:18,031
we all just settle down for the night.

224
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,948
- Hey.

225
00:11:20,242 --> 00:11:21,701
My name is Halsy Knox.

226
00:11:21,911 --> 00:11:23,119

- Sylvene McFall.

229
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:29,167
- How do you do, Sylvene?

230
00:11:29,376 --> 00:11:31,336
- I just guess we're all
free, white and 21 eh?

231
00:11:31,545 --> 00:11:34,172
- And uh, anything goes?

232
00:11:34,381 --> 00:11:37,008
(roosters crows)

233
00:11:38,636 --> 00:11:42,764

261
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,935
You got any lube nipples for a Yamaha 250?

262
00:13:53,145 --> 00:13:53,770
No.

263
00:13:53,979 --> 00:13:54,687
- No got.

264
00:13:55,981 --> 00:13:56,773
- Shit.

265
00:14:03,447 --> 00:14:05,323

(whistles jauntily)

267
00:14:35,229 --> 00:14:36,521
You got head gaskets?

268
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,773
- Oh, head gaskets we got.

269
00:14:39,691 --> 00:14:42,068
(Halsy hums)

270
00:14:44,446 --> 00:14:47,907
(Halsy whistles jauntily)

271
00:14:49,284 --> 00:14:53,413
- [Halsy] Owner around?
- [Little] He's out to lunch.

272
00:15:07,052 --> 00:15:08,761
Thought I'd promote
myself a couple of tires

273
00:15:08,971 --> 00:15:11,431
if the boss was around.

274
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,683
Them I got seen too many races
if I head out for the desert

275
00:15:13,892 --> 00:15:15,643
on Sunday, you goin'?

276
00:15:15,853 --> 00:15:18,104
- It's a buck-59 for the gasket.

277
00:15:18,313 --> 00:15:22,358
- Hey, let me use your torque
wrench for about five minutes.

278
00:15:24,611 --> 00:15:25,862
I thought you said he wasn't around?

279
00:15:26,071 --> 00:15:27,238
- He'll be back.

280
00:15:27,448 --> 00:15:29,115
- [Halsy] After lunch, you said!

281
00:15:29,324 --> 00:15:30,658
- Hey!

282
00:15:30,868 --> 00:15:31,993
It's a buck-59.

283
00:15:33,328 --> 00:15:34,954
Hey, it's a buck-59.

284
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:38,458
Hey incidentally, um.

285
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:42,545
It's a buck-50 for those
gaskets plus nine cents tax.

286
00:15:42,754 --> 00:15:46,340
- You sure got some small
ideas about friendship, man.

287
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,675
Hey what's the matter, you
think I ain't gonna pay you

288
00:15:47,885 --> 00:15:49,135
or somethin'?

289
00:15:49,344 --> 00:15:50,094
- Hey, forget it.

290
00:15:50,304 --> 00:15:51,637
- No, I always pay my own bills.

291
00:15:51,847 --> 00:15:53,055
Where is that?

292
00:15:53,265 --> 00:15:54,557
- Oh, well if you're
gonna use that gasket,

293
00:15:54,766 --> 00:15:56,350
you better seat it first.

294
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,185
- Seat it?

295
00:15:57,394 --> 00:15:59,353
- Yeah, so you don't get any blow blank.

296
00:15:59,563 --> 00:16:02,482
- Well I'm no scientist,
I just ride bikes.

297
00:16:02,691 --> 00:16:04,233
Is this coffee for the general use here?

298
00:16:04,443 --> 00:16:05,151
- Customers.

299
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,653
- These sponsor guys are a
pain in the ass anyway. I hate ‘em.

300
00:16:07,863 --> 00:16:09,739
They don't know sugar.

301
00:16:09,948 --> 00:16:11,866
- [Little] What?
- [Halsy] Sugar.

302
00:16:12,075 --> 00:16:12,825
- What about it?

303
00:16:13,035 --> 00:16:14,076
- Don't have to stay up all night

304
00:16:14,286 --> 00:16:17,079
workin' on a bike the night before.

305
00:16:18,373 --> 00:16:19,999
They just stay up all night
lovin' the women and drinkin'

306
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:23,419
it up and doin' whatever they damn want.

307
00:16:25,422 --> 00:16:27,298
How about a little cream?

308
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:29,634
- Hey uh, where's your wife today?

309
00:16:29,843 --> 00:16:30,801
- My who?

310
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:32,595
- Oh, you know, your wife.

311
00:16:32,804 --> 00:16:33,513
- Oh, uh.

312
00:16:34,515 --> 00:16:37,183
Yeah, she's uh, she's a stewardess.

313
00:16:37,392 --> 00:16:39,185
Had an early flight out this morning.

Didn't have no time to
fix me any breakfast.

315
00:16:41,522 --> 00:16:42,563
Whose doughnut is this?

316
00:16:42,773 --> 00:16:44,815
Is this somebody's?

317
00:16:45,025 --> 00:16:47,193
Come on, I'll let you buy me a beer.

318

319
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,364

- You ran right under me,
you bird-brained creep.

485
00:27:02,142 --> 00:27:03,350
- [Little] I think I broke my leg, man.

486
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,728
- What the hell did you
run right under me for?

487
00:27:06,938 --> 00:27:09,148
- [Little] You hurt any?

488
00:27:09,357 --> 00:27:10,774
- Broke my chain, I think.

489
00:27:10,984 --> 00:27:12,192
(motorcycle engines)

490
00:27:12,402 --> 00:27:13,193
God damnit!

491
00:27:13,403 --> 00:27:14,611
Get out the way!

492
00:27:16,865 --> 00:27:18,240
God damn bike!

493
00:27:18,449 --> 00:27:20,868
- What are you gonna do, Hals?

494
00:27:21,077 --> 00:27:22,744
Halsy, I can't get out of my pants!

495
00:27:22,954 --> 00:27:24,121
My leg's broken.

496
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:25,998
- Yeah, go on, okay.

497
00:27:26,207 --> 00:27:26,915
Get out!

498
00:27:28,668 --> 00:27:32,379
(motorcycle engines)

499
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:35,883
(drowned out by engines)

500
00:27:41,264 --> 00:27:42,514
You got matches?

501
00:27:42,724 --> 00:27:43,348
- Matches?

502
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:44,349
- How the hell am I gonna find you

503
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,894
if when I come back it's dark?

504
00:27:47,103 --> 00:27:49,479
- You'll be back before dark.

505
00:27:49,689 --> 00:27:51,773
They'll send somebody back before dark.

506
00:27:51,983 --> 00:27:54,109
- Oh ho, not these Micky
Mouse Country Road shows, man.

507
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:56,069
They don't take no responsibility.

508
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:58,530
You're on your own.
- [Little] Hey, Halsy.

509
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,200
You'll be back before dark,
it's only four o'clock!

510
00:28:01,409 --> 00:28:02,576
- Oh, oh yeah!

511
00:28:02,785 --> 00:28:04,411
Only just light a match
when you hear me comin'.

512
00:28:04,621 --> 00:28:05,579
Just in case.

513
00:28:06,623 --> 00:28:08,081
That's right, you!

514
00:28:11,544 --> 00:28:13,212
- Thanks a lot, you comin' back or not?

515
00:28:13,421 --> 00:28:14,922
I got a broke leg!

516
00:28:15,131 --> 00:28:15,881
- Hey don't panic, man.

517
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:19,384
You panic in this weather, it'll kill ya.

518
00:28:21,596 --> 00:28:22,554
Here you go.

519
00:28:23,514 --> 00:28:24,514
- What's this?

520
00:28:24,724 --> 00:28:28,936
- That's what to do in case
of snake bite, read it.

521
00:28:29,145 --> 00:28:32,022
(motorcycle engine)

522
00:28:42,533 --> 00:28:44,785
- [Voiceover] Let's everybody
now remember this race

523
00:28:44,994 --> 00:28:46,578
is all for trophies here today, gang.

524
00:28:46,788 --> 00:28:47,955
So let's give everybody a nice hand

525
00:28:48,164 --> 00:28:49,289
when they cross that finish line.

526
00:28:49,499 --> 00:28:50,666
We've still got a lot of riders coming in.

527
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:52,251
A lot of winners to sort out.

528
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,503
And all of you guys know
that they get one trophy.

529
00:28:54,712 --> 00:28:58,131
Get your machines and get over
there by that trophy case.

530
00:28:58,341 --> 00:29:00,092
All right, now let's get over
there by that trophy case,

531
00:29:00,301 --> 00:29:01,510
what do you say?

532
00:29:04,472 --> 00:29:05,430
- Say, you ought to be a model.

533
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,598
- Would you please quit it?

534
00:29:06,808 --> 00:29:07,599
- Oh, babe.

535
00:29:08,476 --> 00:29:10,143
Listen, I'm an expert, do you
know how many races I won?

536
00:29:10,353 --> 00:29:12,813
- Do you have to do that?

537
00:29:13,022 --> 00:29:14,523
- Every time I've come some trophy chick

538
00:29:14,732 --> 00:29:16,316
who thinks she's Ann-Margret.

539
00:29:16,526 --> 00:29:17,985
- I never said I was any Ann-Margret.

540
00:29:18,194 --> 00:29:19,778
- Listen, these hands have held
the boobs of more top-flight

541
00:29:19,988 --> 00:29:21,113
actresses than trophy girls.

542
00:29:21,322 --> 00:29:24,825
- Well I'm not any
trophy girl, now come on.

543
00:29:25,034 --> 00:29:25,659
Please?

544
00:29:25,868 --> 00:29:26,910
- You got 'em all beat, my dear.

545
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,370
(both laughing)
By a mile.

546
00:29:28,579 --> 00:29:30,080
- [Woman] You.
- [Halsy] Two miles.

547
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,581
- Yeah, but you know they
don't have trophy girls

548
00:29:31,791 --> 00:29:33,458
at desert endures.
- [Halsy] Yeah...

549
00:29:33,668 --> 00:29:37,421
The cheap-asses, all this racing, no ass.

550
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:41,800
- Would you please take
your hands off my things?

551
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,553
- Some people really don't
know how to take a compliment.

552
00:29:44,762 --> 00:29:46,179
- Well I thank you, but my gosh.

553
00:29:46,389 --> 00:29:48,015
I mean, there's a lot of people here.

554
00:29:48,224 --> 00:29:50,392
It's kind of embarrassing
in public and everything.

555
00:29:50,601 --> 00:29:51,310
- Why?

556
00:29:52,312 --> 00:29:54,313
- Well, I don't know but,

557
00:29:54,522 --> 00:29:57,065
one thing is you haven't
even gotten your trophy yet.

558
00:29:57,275 --> 00:29:58,734
- (laughs) Damned if I don't.

559
00:29:58,943 --> 00:29:59,651
- Yeah.

560
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:06,658
Hey, what are you doing?
(motorcycle engine)

561
00:30:12,665 --> 00:30:16,877
(crickets chirping)
(coyote howling)

562
00:30:17,086 --> 00:30:20,213
- When are the other guys
gettin' back, Joe and Bill?

563
00:30:20,423 --> 00:30:23,842
Oh, they'll be back here
any minute now, Don.

564
00:30:24,052 --> 00:30:27,012
Hey, would you care for
a cup of coffee, Spike?

565
00:30:27,221 --> 00:30:28,930
How about you, George?

566
00:30:29,932 --> 00:30:31,892
Thank you, Joe.

567
00:30:32,101 --> 00:30:34,686
Well, you're welcome, Fred.

568
00:30:34,896 --> 00:30:35,854
I mean, Bill.

569
00:30:37,732 --> 00:30:39,941
Where you workin' now, Joe?

570
00:30:41,027 --> 00:30:43,612
Oh you know, down by the railroad tracks.

571
00:30:43,821 --> 00:30:46,114
Oh you are? You like it?

572
00:30:46,324 --> 00:30:48,867
Well you know, it's uh, oh yeah.

573
00:30:49,827 --> 00:30:52,329
Oh well, would you care for an orange?

574
00:30:52,538 --> 00:30:54,873
No, I don't wanna ruin my breakfast.

575
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:56,333
- Hey, dude.

576
00:30:56,542 --> 00:30:58,418
I hate to tear you away
from your friends but,

577
00:30:58,628 --> 00:31:01,046
(woman giggles)
I gotta split.

578
00:31:01,255 --> 00:31:03,715
They got pro races every
weekend out there in California

579
00:31:03,925 --> 00:31:06,134
someplace and if we split out there,

580
00:31:06,344 --> 00:31:08,637
who's gonna know who's you and who's me?

581
00:31:08,846 --> 00:31:11,056
- Somebody's gonna find out.

582
00:31:12,767 --> 00:31:14,893
- You think you're famous?

583
00:31:15,103 --> 00:31:18,146
It's a funny thing but
nobody knows me out there.

584
00:31:18,356 --> 00:31:19,648
So how are they gonna know who's who,

585
00:31:19,857 --> 00:31:22,025
if I'm there with your bike,
your license, your number

586
00:31:22,235 --> 00:31:25,237
and you're standin'
right there to deny it?

587
00:31:25,446 --> 00:31:26,446
- How will we split it up?

588
00:31:26,656 --> 00:31:27,364
- Halfs!

589
00:31:27,573 --> 00:31:29,032
Hold on, excuse me.

590
00:31:29,242 --> 00:31:31,243
All points go automatic
under your name, not mine.

591
00:31:31,452 --> 00:31:33,453
Toward your expert card, your
standing in the nationals

592
00:31:33,663 --> 00:31:34,830
which the way you ride is the
only way you're ever gonna

593
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,250
qualify if somebody race for you.

594
00:31:38,459 --> 00:31:40,877
You're actin' like you're
doin' me a favor, shit.

595
00:31:41,087 --> 00:31:43,672
(car horn)

596
00:31:43,881 --> 00:31:47,134
- Seems like a good deal
to me, the way I see it.

597
00:31:47,343 --> 00:31:49,052
- Yeah, for sideburns.

598
00:31:50,012 --> 00:31:52,305
- If I want to race pro...

599
00:31:52,515 --> 00:31:53,890
Where could I race pro around here?―

600
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,684
- What are you talkin' about racing for?

601
00:31:55,893 --> 00:31:57,477
You're his tuner, Little.

602
00:31:57,687 --> 00:32:00,480
He's racing, dummy, on your
bike, with your license

603
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,732
'cause he got throwed out.

604
00:32:04,527 --> 00:32:06,653
- Meantime, I could
hit all the main events

605
00:32:06,863 --> 00:32:10,115
across the country, Dad, I
can't do that around here.

606
00:32:10,324 --> 00:32:11,908
- Meantime who pays?

607
00:32:12,118 --> 00:32:15,829
- You know I think he done it on purpose.

608
00:32:16,038 --> 00:32:17,164
- Broke my leg?

609
00:32:17,373 --> 00:32:20,000
- What's a broke leg to his kind?

610
00:32:21,752 --> 00:32:24,713
- You'll have to prove that to me.

611
00:32:24,922 --> 00:32:26,715
- I might just do that.

612
00:32:27,925 --> 00:32:29,551
(car horn)

613
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,303
- Well I gotta go.

614
00:32:31,512 --> 00:32:32,929
- [Halsy] Hey, come on, dude!

615
00:32:33,139 --> 00:32:35,265
(car horn)

616
00:32:44,108 --> 00:32:45,442
- Little?

617
00:32:45,651 --> 00:32:46,318
Little.

618
00:32:47,862 --> 00:32:49,696
(stutters)

619
00:32:49,906 --> 00:32:52,449
The best fortune to you, Little.

620
00:32:55,161 --> 00:32:57,162
But I still don't see no good out of

621
00:32:57,371 --> 00:33:00,957
hookin' up with an
undesirable like that though.

622
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:03,126
- That goes ditto for me.

623
00:33:04,212 --> 00:33:05,795
- I know what you all mean, you know?

624
00:33:06,005 --> 00:33:10,258
But if I wanna race, there's
a lot I can learn from him.

625
00:33:10,468 --> 00:33:11,176
And uh...

626
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,640
There's a few things
I could teach him too.

627
00:33:16,849 --> 00:33:18,308
Anyway.

628
00:33:18,518 --> 00:33:20,477
What else is there to do?

629
00:33:23,898 --> 00:33:26,066
We're gonna split 50/50.

630
00:33:26,275 --> 00:33:26,942
So, um.

631
00:33:28,444 --> 00:33:31,696
I got nothin' to lose.
(car horn)

632
00:33:31,906 --> 00:33:32,697
- Dear god!

633
00:33:50,341 --> 00:33:53,510
(truck engine revving)

634
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:05,313
(cacophonous motorcycle engines)

635
00:34:15,491 --> 00:34:16,283
- [Voiceover] Wait a minute.

636
00:34:16,492 --> 00:34:18,493
As Fauss went by out there,
he just took the front wheel

637
00:34:18,703 --> 00:34:20,287
right off of number 80.

638
00:34:20,496 --> 00:34:24,457
(cacophonous motorcycle engines)

639
00:34:34,844 --> 00:34:36,136
- Halsy, come on!

640
00:34:36,345 --> 00:34:37,887
- Come on, Halsy!

641
00:34:38,097 --> 00:34:39,389
Come on, baby!

642
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,182
Come on, Halsy!

643
00:34:41,392 --> 00:34:42,726
- Hey, man.

644
00:34:42,935 --> 00:34:45,061
Great, Halsy. Great, man.

645
00:34:45,271 --> 00:34:46,938
Hey, out of sight, man.

646
00:34:47,148 --> 00:34:48,023
- Man this bike, woo!

647
00:34:48,232 --> 00:34:50,191
Use them other scooters for traction!

648
00:34:50,401 --> 00:34:51,735
- One more lap, wasn't even half a mile,

649
00:34:51,944 --> 00:34:53,069
you would have been first.

650
00:34:53,279 --> 00:34:54,571
- You know what even second pays?

651
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:55,405
$30.

652
00:34:55,615 --> 00:34:56,531
Screw first!

653
00:34:56,741 --> 00:34:58,158
- Hey.

654
00:34:58,367 --> 00:34:59,576
Beer's on you for a week.

655
00:34:59,785 --> 00:35:02,287
- Beer nothin', I'm gettin' me a pint!

656
00:35:02,496 --> 00:35:06,374
(crowd shouting over each other)

657
00:35:06,584 --> 00:35:08,043
He fell right into my groove,
man, hell it took two laps

658
00:35:08,252 --> 00:35:09,127
before they could even
get 'em out of there.

659
00:35:09,337 --> 00:35:09,961
Did you see that?

660
00:35:10,171 --> 00:35:11,129
Is he dead or anything?

661
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:13,006
Just to darn my fun?

662
00:35:13,215 --> 00:35:14,591
Even though I'm workin' so
hard just sittin' in there

663
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,302
in that position it's just so exciting.

664
00:35:17,511 --> 00:35:19,220
- There's just one thing I
wanna ask you, Halsy Knox,

665
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,472
and that's who the hell is she?

666
00:35:20,681 --> 00:35:22,891
- Who in the hell am I? Who in
the hell are you, you bitch!

667
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,101
- You know, if I could just
get in there all night long,

668
00:35:25,311 --> 00:35:26,311
even though I'm working.

669
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,228
Hey, hey!

670
00:35:28,272 --> 00:35:31,149
(door creaks open)

671
00:35:43,287 --> 00:35:45,872
Hey, what are you sleepin' in the car for?

672
00:35:46,082 --> 00:35:47,415
- Somebody's gotta guard the bikes.

673
00:35:47,625 --> 00:35:50,293
- I'll guard the bikes. Go on in.

674
00:35:50,503 --> 00:35:52,087
- Where'd you get that flashlight?

675
00:35:52,296 --> 00:35:53,922
- Hey man, look at this.

676
00:35:54,131 --> 00:35:57,258
It cleans up lint, it
air-conditions your face.

677
00:35:57,468 --> 00:35:58,426
It's even got a table on the side

678
00:35:58,636 --> 00:36:01,137
that gives weights and measures.

679
00:36:01,347 --> 00:36:03,098
- You just gonna top it off?

680
00:36:03,307 --> 00:36:04,766
- Well listen, you get
stopped by the highway patrol,

681
00:36:04,975 --> 00:36:06,476
they're gonna give you a ticket
if you don't have the proper

682
00:36:06,686 --> 00:36:08,603
safety equipment.

683
00:36:08,813 --> 00:36:09,562
Are you goin' in or not?

684
00:36:09,772 --> 00:36:11,147
- I guess I better not.

685
00:36:11,357 --> 00:36:13,024
- Come on, tell them I
said it was all right.

686
00:36:13,234 --> 00:36:15,485
It's okay by me, come on!

687
00:36:15,695 --> 00:36:17,987
- I think I've come down with a cold.

688
00:36:18,197 --> 00:36:18,905
- Oh.

689
00:36:21,075 --> 00:36:22,534
Okay, let's split.

690
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:25,161
- You just cut out on Moneth?

691
00:36:25,371 --> 00:36:26,079
- Yeah.

692
00:36:28,749 --> 00:36:30,125
Hold on a second.

693
00:36:40,136 --> 00:36:42,804
Hey, I thought you said you had a cold?

694
00:36:43,013 --> 00:36:44,472
- Well, it's not that bad.

695
00:36:44,682 --> 00:36:46,307
- Man, we're leavin'!

696
00:36:47,268 --> 00:36:49,769
- Well I just thought I'd
go say goodbye to Moneth.

697
00:36:49,979 --> 00:36:51,020
- Oh, to hell with her.

698
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,272
What's she to you?

699
00:36:52,481 --> 00:36:53,189
- Nothing.

700
00:36:55,735 --> 00:36:59,821
You know, but, it's such an
easy set-up like you said.

701
00:37:00,781 --> 00:37:01,740
- Forget it.

702
00:37:02,783 --> 00:37:05,076
- Well now is a good time to
take care of the shyness I got

703
00:37:05,286 --> 00:37:08,538
and strike while the iron's
hot 'cause nobody cares.

704
00:37:08,748 --> 00:37:11,541
- Well Little, you had your chance.

705
00:37:11,751 --> 00:37:14,794
- Couldn't I just, take a peak?

706
00:37:15,004 --> 00:37:17,380
(Halsy sighs)

707
00:37:19,675 --> 00:37:21,426
- [Voiceover] So this year's
crop and to the surplus

708
00:37:21,635 --> 00:37:24,554
carryover is at the end
of this year, the surplus

709
00:37:24,764 --> 00:37:27,766
is expected to be down to
about 12-million bales.

710
00:37:27,975 --> 00:37:30,143
And on the basis of current
guesses, the surplus

711
00:37:30,352 --> 00:37:33,188
could be cut to about 9-million bales.

712
00:37:33,397 --> 00:37:37,066
There has been a new proposal
for a compromise plan.

713
00:37:37,276 --> 00:37:39,319
(buzzing)

714
00:37:40,821 --> 00:37:42,697
It comes from a Kansas
congressman who wants

715
00:37:42,907 --> 00:37:44,908
a scaled-down version of the program.

716
00:37:45,117 --> 00:37:47,660
- They're gonna feel awfully
bad, Halsy, when they wake up

717
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:50,163
and find out you're not here.

718
00:38:00,466 --> 00:38:01,591
- No sir, man.

719
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,888
Once a chick swings AC/DC on ya, split.

720
00:38:08,682 --> 00:38:09,891
Once it's cool.

721
00:38:10,893 --> 00:38:12,268
Twice it's queer.

722
00:38:12,478 --> 00:38:15,271
(country music)

723
00:38:15,481 --> 00:38:17,774
♫ Little Fauss and Big Halsy

724
00:38:17,983 --> 00:38:20,360
♫ Man they make a winning team

725
00:38:20,569 --> 00:38:22,612
♫ Fauss supes up the engine

726
00:38:22,822 --> 00:38:25,573
♫ And Halsy is a woman's dream

727
00:38:25,783 --> 00:38:29,285
♫ But they keep on movin', movin', movin'

728
00:38:29,495 --> 00:38:33,081
♫ Honey they movin' right along

729
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:35,834
♫ Ain't never found a place, sweetheart

730
00:38:36,043 --> 00:38:40,088
♫ I could really settle and call my home ♫

731
00:38:44,677 --> 00:38:45,593
- Hals?

732
00:38:45,803 --> 00:38:47,178
- Yeah.

733
00:38:47,388 --> 00:38:49,180
- Are you awake?

734
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:51,516
- I better be. I'm drivin'.

735
00:38:55,354 --> 00:38:56,229
- Hey, man.

736
00:38:57,481 --> 00:38:59,774
What the hell? What
did you do to this car?

737
00:38:59,984 --> 00:39:01,568
- [Little] I was sleeping--
- [Halsy] Look at it!

738
00:39:01,777 --> 00:39:03,027
Look at the gauge.

739
00:39:03,237 --> 00:39:04,612
That dude's all the way over.

740
00:39:04,822 --> 00:39:06,030
- Well, it's not my fault!

741
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,448
- Well you were sleeping
in the car all night.

742
00:39:07,658 --> 00:39:09,284
- That's exactly what
I was doin', sleepin'!

743
00:39:09,493 --> 00:39:13,121
- Well what were you
thinkin' about in there?

744
00:39:22,256 --> 00:39:25,049
Well you better get on this, dude.

745
00:39:41,442 --> 00:39:42,650
Son of a bitch.

746
00:40:04,173 --> 00:40:07,133
(rumbling overhead)

747
00:40:11,388 --> 00:40:13,765
What's it gonna do now, rain?

748
00:40:15,935 --> 00:40:17,894
(sighs)

749
00:40:29,698 --> 00:40:34,285
Hey if I tell you somethin',
you gotta believe me, okay?

750
00:40:34,495 --> 00:40:38,790
- Well, I usually believe
what people tell me.

751
00:40:38,999 --> 00:40:41,626
- No. (chuckles)

752
00:40:41,835 --> 00:40:43,461
Not this you won't.

753
00:40:43,671 --> 00:40:45,296
- Well, I don't know.

754
00:40:46,674 --> 00:40:47,674
You know, the truth is

755
00:40:47,883 --> 00:40:51,636
unless it's what people say, you know?

756
00:40:51,845 --> 00:40:55,890
- I bet you think that I
make out really good, huh?

757
00:40:57,351 --> 00:40:59,519
Well I don't, I don't.

758
00:40:59,728 --> 00:41:00,895
I don't make out good.

759
00:41:01,105 --> 00:41:02,772
You know those girls?

760
00:41:02,982 --> 00:41:06,359
Do you think I don't know they're dogs?

761
00:41:06,568 --> 00:41:09,278
- I didn't know if you knew or not.

762
00:41:11,031 --> 00:41:14,993
- I don't know why, with
all I got goin' for me,

763
00:41:16,203 --> 00:41:18,579
all I get are the dumb-dumbs.

764
00:41:20,416 --> 00:41:22,709
- They mean well, I guess.

765
00:41:22,918 --> 00:41:24,669
- You think I don't know who they are?

766
00:41:24,878 --> 00:41:26,379
What they are?

767
00:41:26,588 --> 00:41:29,465
- I don't know, if they were or not.

768
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:37,473
- You know, sometimes when drunk I...

769
00:41:38,767 --> 00:41:42,228
I really think that they're princesses.

770
00:41:42,438 --> 00:41:44,480
Then I wake up and,

771
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:46,065
they're just pigs.

772
00:41:48,569 --> 00:41:51,237
- I just figured you liked pigs.

773
00:41:51,447 --> 00:41:54,365
(both laugh)

774
00:41:54,575 --> 00:41:58,036
- Hey, you thought old
Moneth was bad, huh?

775
00:41:59,038 --> 00:42:00,580
- I just see, you know.

776
00:42:00,789 --> 00:42:04,459
If she wasn't a pretty
girl or so indecent,

777
00:42:04,668 --> 00:42:06,711
they had just, it figures.

778
00:42:07,963 --> 00:42:11,132
- No man, I mean that's
what I'm tellin' ya.

779
00:42:11,341 --> 00:42:13,551
It's just these gland
cases and hurtin' whores

780
00:42:13,761 --> 00:42:14,969
that'll have me.

781
00:42:20,142 --> 00:42:21,934
Where the hell are we?

782
00:42:26,356 --> 00:42:27,565
- I don't know.

783
00:42:32,279 --> 00:42:33,738
- Stay clean, man.

784
00:42:35,991 --> 00:42:38,326
- Hey, I'm not so clean.

785
00:42:38,535 --> 00:42:39,952
- I don't mean pure.

786
00:42:40,162 --> 00:42:42,622
- Oh, I used to see my
foot sometime. (chuckles)

787
00:42:42,831 --> 00:42:43,956
- I mean decent.

788
00:42:44,166 --> 00:42:46,084
- Hey Halsy, you know, just because...

789
00:42:46,293 --> 00:42:50,463
Just because you yank it up
all the time... (chuckles)

790
00:42:50,672 --> 00:42:53,883
I'm not your pure St. Peter, you know?

791
00:42:56,261 --> 00:42:59,555
- [Halsy] You know what?
- [Little] What?

792
00:43:01,975 --> 00:43:04,519
- All I say is, it's just talk.

793
00:43:08,023 --> 00:43:11,067
- No, you're a sure good talker, man.

794
00:43:11,276 --> 00:43:14,112
You had two chicks in the sack.

795
00:43:14,321 --> 00:43:15,947
Stupid me, man.

796
00:43:16,156 --> 00:43:20,034
Sleepin' in the car. (chuckles)

797
00:43:22,287 --> 00:43:24,497
(rainfall)

798
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:29,085
(overhead rumbling)

799
00:43:50,107 --> 00:43:53,151
(motorcycle engines)

800
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:09,500
It's pre-igniting again, we
gotta go to a colder plug.

801
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:10,960
- [Voiceover] You guys wanna step it up?

802
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:13,713
We're running a little bit late.

803
00:44:18,177 --> 00:44:20,970
This will be a 250 through 650 class.

804
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:24,682
We're gonna run a quarter of
a mile for at least two miles.

805
00:44:24,892 --> 00:44:26,559
- Are you gonna pay attention
to what this guy's sayin'?

806
00:44:26,768 --> 00:44:28,436
- (chuckles) Look over there.

807
00:44:28,645 --> 00:44:29,687
- Huh?

808
00:44:29,897 --> 00:44:31,397
Jesus Christ.

809
00:44:31,607 --> 00:44:35,401
(men shouting over each other)

810
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,573
(whistling)

811
00:44:45,746 --> 00:44:46,704
Oh, my hell.

812
00:44:51,877 --> 00:44:53,419
Okay, get rid of her.

813
00:44:53,629 --> 00:44:54,462
- Me?

814
00:44:54,671 --> 00:44:55,588
It's your truck.

815
00:44:55,797 --> 00:44:57,757
- Well, you're a good Samaritan.

816
00:44:57,966 --> 00:44:59,759
- And you're the Don Juan.

817
00:44:59,968 --> 00:45:01,177
- Hey man, just dump
her out, get rid of her.

818
00:45:01,386 --> 00:45:03,179
I don't care how.

819
00:45:03,388 --> 00:45:04,847
- And just leave her there?

820
00:45:05,057 --> 00:45:06,349
- Well they did, didn't they?

821
00:45:06,558 --> 00:45:07,808
- [Little] Yeah but they're undesirable―

822
00:45:08,018 --> 00:45:09,685
- Hey, I don't want her
there when I come back, okay?

823
00:45:09,895 --> 00:45:12,146
Now I got a bike to ride.

824
00:45:12,356 --> 00:45:15,942
(men cheering and whistling)

825
00:45:23,033 --> 00:45:25,660
(woman panting)

826
00:45:26,662 --> 00:45:28,704
- Hey, this is our truck.

827
00:45:31,959 --> 00:45:35,586
(woman panting and moaning)

828
00:45:42,177 --> 00:45:44,178
Hey, this is our truck.

829
00:45:44,388 --> 00:45:47,932
(woman panting and moaning)

830
00:45:49,393 --> 00:45:53,437
Uh, you need a dime or
anything to make a call?

831
00:45:53,647 --> 00:45:54,355
Lady?

832
00:45:59,695 --> 00:46:02,321
- Do you know where a gym is?

833
00:46:02,531 --> 00:46:03,990
- A gym?

834
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:06,158
- You know, if we go into
town with a gym in it.

835
00:46:06,368 --> 00:46:07,451
Just let me out at the gym.

836
00:46:07,661 --> 00:46:08,286
- What are you doin'?

837
00:46:08,495 --> 00:46:11,414
- 'Cause I gotta start workin' out.

838
00:46:11,623 --> 00:46:12,832
- Man, I wasn't payin'
no attention to her.

839
00:46:13,041 --> 00:46:14,000
I don't think she knows what she's doin'

840
00:46:14,209 --> 00:46:16,002
or talkin' about or nothin'.
- [Woman] Who's your friend?

841
00:46:16,211 --> 00:46:16,961
- What are you doin', lady?

842
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:19,338
- I don't think you can find
a gym around here, lady.

843
00:46:19,548 --> 00:46:20,798
- 'Cause that's the first
thing you do when you start

844
00:46:21,008 --> 00:46:24,302
gettin' straight, is you
start eatin', puttin' on fat.

845
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,636
Uh-uh.

846
00:46:25,846 --> 00:46:27,263
You guys don't turn on, or what?

847
00:46:27,472 --> 00:46:30,016
- Now listen, damnit, I
told you about that light.

848
00:46:30,225 --> 00:46:31,851
- I'm just trying to exercise a little.

849
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:34,770
(arguing over each other)

850
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:36,355
Just don't push!

851
00:46:36,565 --> 00:46:37,189
Shit.

852
00:46:37,399 --> 00:46:38,399
- Hey, get out of the car.

853
00:46:38,608 --> 00:46:41,527
- Hey, wait a minute!
(truck horn)

854
00:46:41,737 --> 00:46:44,322
- [Halsy] Get out the car.
- [Woman] Hey, hey, hey!

855
00:46:44,531 --> 00:46:45,823
- [Halsy] Get out of the car. (laughs)

856
00:46:46,033 --> 00:46:49,035
- Hey come on, I'm just
trying to exercise, okay.

857
00:46:49,244 --> 00:46:51,329
Wanna taste somethin' good?

858
00:46:52,247 --> 00:46:53,456
- Wow, wow man.

859
00:46:54,875 --> 00:46:56,959
Hey Halsy?
- [Halsy] Yeah I heard, man.

860
00:46:57,169 --> 00:46:57,877
- Oh, boy.

861
00:46:59,212 --> 00:47:00,588
- Do you wanna taste somethin' good?

862
00:47:00,797 --> 00:47:04,175
- Hey, no that's not funny, it's just bad.

863
00:47:13,185 --> 00:47:16,354
- Hey, you don't have a guitar, do you?

864
00:47:17,731 --> 00:47:18,689
- Guitar?

865
00:47:18,899 --> 00:47:20,316
- Do you have a guitar?

866
00:47:20,525 --> 00:47:24,487
- (laughs) No we got no guitars.

867
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,619
- You play guitar?

868
00:47:32,621 --> 00:47:33,496
- Yeah.

869
00:47:33,705 --> 00:47:36,165
In New York City I play guitar.

870
00:47:37,417 --> 00:47:39,752
- [Halsy] Let's go, buddy.
- [Little] Yeah.

871
00:47:39,961 --> 00:47:42,171
- Somebody stole my guitar.

872
00:47:42,381 --> 00:47:43,089
- No shit.

873
00:47:45,967 --> 00:47:48,260
- Hey listen, it'll be okay.

874
00:47:49,262 --> 00:47:50,721
You'll find a guitar.

875
00:47:50,931 --> 00:47:52,765
- It's okay, don't stay, just split.

876
00:47:52,974 --> 00:47:54,475
I don't want you in my karma anyway.

877
00:47:54,684 --> 00:47:59,063
I gotta be very careful
who I let in my karma.

878
00:47:59,272 --> 00:48:00,147
- Your what?

879
00:48:01,441 --> 00:48:02,858
- I'm not lettin' anybody in my life

880
00:48:03,068 --> 00:48:05,444
when I get straight this time.

881
00:48:20,168 --> 00:48:22,336
- Hey, did you ever notice
that you can drive all day

882
00:48:22,546 --> 00:48:23,587
and all night,

883
00:48:24,673 --> 00:48:28,676
and wherever you stop it's
the same greasy hamburgers?

884
00:48:28,885 --> 00:48:30,553
The same fried egg.

885
00:48:30,762 --> 00:48:33,305
Served by the same fat waitress.

886
00:48:34,349 --> 00:48:38,686
It's just like you never
went nowhere at all.

887
00:48:38,895 --> 00:48:42,106
- It's like you never went nowhere.

888
00:48:43,817 --> 00:48:45,860
- That's just what I said.

889
00:48:46,069 --> 00:48:49,363
That's what I said, dude.
(Little chuckles)

890
00:48:49,573 --> 00:48:51,198
It's always the same.

891
00:48:57,539 --> 00:49:00,249
- What are we gonna do about her?

892
00:49:03,545 --> 00:49:05,087
- It's her lookout.

893
00:49:06,923 --> 00:49:09,967
- Well sure, where are we even going?

894
00:49:12,053 --> 00:49:16,015
- Just some other greasy
spoon down the road.

895
00:49:16,224 --> 00:49:17,266
- Yeah.

896
00:49:17,476 --> 00:49:21,103
It's just another greasy
spoon down the road.

897
00:49:25,984 --> 00:49:27,443
- I gave her five bucks.

898
00:49:27,652 --> 00:49:29,778
- You gave her three bucks.

899
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:33,282
- Oh, was it three?

900
00:49:34,576 --> 00:49:37,745
- What's she gonna do with three bucks?

901
00:49:40,499 --> 00:49:41,957
- You big lover.

902
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,127
(chuckles)

903
00:49:45,337 --> 00:49:46,837
- I don't have to be her lover.

904
00:49:47,047 --> 00:49:51,842
- (chuckles) I knew you'd
get yourself in trouble.

905
00:49:52,052 --> 00:49:53,594
- Well you get yourself in trouble,

906
00:49:53,803 --> 00:49:55,304
why can't I get myself in trouble?

907
00:49:55,514 --> 00:49:57,223
- Hey, because I can get myself out.

908
00:49:57,432 --> 00:49:59,558
I can get myself out again.

909
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:03,312
- I want her.

910
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:07,066
- You want her?

911
00:50:07,275 --> 00:50:09,026
- I can want somebody too, you know.

912
00:50:09,236 --> 00:50:12,029
- Oh no, man, I can get you somebody.

913
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:13,948
You could have Moneth.

914
00:50:15,325 --> 00:50:17,409
- I want somebody who's my own.

915
00:50:17,619 --> 00:50:19,370
What is that dope-head
community screw, man.

916
00:50:19,579 --> 00:50:22,665
She's nothin' but some
mama for all them freaks.

917
00:50:22,874 --> 00:50:24,917
- No man, she's all alone.

918
00:50:26,086 --> 00:50:28,379
(boat horn)

919
00:50:46,731 --> 00:50:48,607
- You know what I wish?

920
00:50:49,776 --> 00:50:50,568
- What?

921
00:50:51,778 --> 00:50:54,697
- I had me a Geiger counter.

922
00:50:54,906 --> 00:50:56,282
- A Geiger counter?

923
00:50:56,491 --> 00:50:58,242
- I'll marry me the first man
who comes up with a Geiger

924
00:50:58,451 --> 00:51:00,160
counter and we'll live at the beach.

925
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:03,163
You know how treasure there
is buried in the sand alone?

926
00:51:03,373 --> 00:51:04,081
Plenty.

927
00:51:13,758 --> 00:51:14,842
- You know what I wish?

928
00:51:15,051 --> 00:51:16,176
- What?

929
00:51:16,386 --> 00:51:18,846
- That somebody asked me what I wished.

930
00:51:19,055 --> 00:51:21,432
- Okay, what do you wish?

931
00:51:21,641 --> 00:51:24,727
- I wish that we'll all be friends

932
00:51:24,936 --> 00:51:27,938
and have good luck and be happy.

933
00:51:28,148 --> 00:51:30,274
(chuckles)

934
00:51:31,943 --> 00:51:33,611
- [Woman] How'd that happen?

935
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:37,031
- Well, I was going as fast as
I ever went in my whole life

936
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,198
and fell off.

937
00:51:41,161 --> 00:51:42,453
Him and me.

938
00:51:42,662 --> 00:51:45,456
- Yeah, I heard you break your leg.

939
00:51:47,334 --> 00:51:50,210
- Hey, remember what happened in digger,

940
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:52,004
he was workin' on the oil rigs.

941
00:51:52,213 --> 00:51:53,631
- Digger?

942
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,215
- Isn't that in Oklahoma?

943
00:51:55,425 --> 00:51:57,885
Where the whole town blew up or something?

944
00:51:58,094 --> 00:51:59,637
- Never heard of it.

945
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:03,015
- He wasn't expected to live at first.

946
00:52:03,224 --> 00:52:04,683
And then he was never supposed to walk.

947
00:52:04,893 --> 00:52:06,018
- Sure.

948
00:52:06,227 --> 00:52:08,395
- Shit, the way he said it,
I thought it was famous.

949
00:52:08,605 --> 00:52:09,396
- Mm, well.

950
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,191
A spine's integrity.

951
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,442
His is broken.

952
00:52:14,694 --> 00:52:15,903
- What's the leg?

953
00:52:17,405 --> 00:52:18,197
- The leg?

954
00:52:20,742 --> 00:52:21,867
- The leg's sport.

955
00:52:29,042 --> 00:52:31,168
- [Voiceover] Slow down, slow down!

956
00:52:31,378 --> 00:52:32,378
Over here, over here!

957
00:52:32,587 --> 00:52:34,296
(screams) Son of a bitch!

958
00:52:34,506 --> 00:52:39,093
- [Voiceover] Watch where
you're goin', you jerk!

959
00:52:39,302 --> 00:52:40,636
- [Voiceover] We've got a
real celebrity here with us

960
00:52:40,845 --> 00:52:41,720
this afternoon, folks.

961
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:44,431
Rick Nifty's in from the
east so this is the guy

962
00:52:44,641 --> 00:52:46,975
that's the guy to watch
here this afternoon.

963
00:52:47,185 --> 00:52:50,270
Let's get all the runners over
here for a rider's meeting.

964
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,190
- Now all you tuners and
sponsors have got to conform too.

965
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,566
No more of these weird outfits.

966
00:52:54,776 --> 00:52:58,278
We got too many of these
weird outfits in the pits.

967
00:52:58,488 --> 00:53:01,240
Now you all wanna keep racing
something you can be proud of

968
00:53:01,449 --> 00:53:03,659
so we gotta get rid of these high heels

969
00:53:03,868 --> 00:53:04,952
and these tight pants.

970
00:53:05,161 --> 00:53:07,371
- I see there's some pretty
illustrious people here today.

971
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:09,873
- [Organizer] Now let's get
back 'cause we got a lot of

972
00:53:10,083 --> 00:53:11,667
things to do and we don't have much time.

973
00:53:11,876 --> 00:53:13,335
Come on, men, let's get going.

974
00:53:13,545 --> 00:53:14,169
- Hey.

975
00:53:14,379 --> 00:53:15,254
- How you doin', Rick?

976
00:53:15,463 --> 00:53:18,132
- Hey, you probably don't
remember but a couple years back

977
00:53:18,341 --> 00:53:20,050
when the army had me for a
couple of years and I got this

978
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:21,885
back messed up in Vietnam, you
and me went a round together

979
00:53:22,095 --> 00:53:23,595
at Sears Points.
- [Rick] Oh, is that right?

980
00:53:23,805 --> 00:53:25,931
- [Voiceover] How's it goin', Rick?

981
00:53:26,141 --> 00:53:27,683
- When Uncle Sam calls
you, you gotta do your duty

982
00:53:27,892 --> 00:53:29,435
and you do your duty even if it costs you

983
00:53:29,644 --> 00:53:31,311
and you gotta begin all over again.

984
00:53:31,521 --> 00:53:32,980
- Look I gotta go to work if
I'm gonna do any racing today.

985
00:53:33,189 --> 00:53:35,065
- Oh hey, no sure, I just wanted
to extend my apologies for

986
00:53:35,275 --> 00:53:36,900
this rotten track, excuse me honey.

987
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:39,153
This rotten track and tell
you to be sure and watch out

988
00:53:39,362 --> 00:53:41,905
for that transmission fluid
on the track and them grease

989
00:53:42,115 --> 00:53:43,949
stains that they left from
the drag races last night.

990
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:44,867
Hey.

991
00:53:45,744 --> 00:53:47,911
I wanted to tell you it's a
real pleasure, a real pleasure

992
00:53:48,121 --> 00:53:50,497
to go around with a top
professional go-faster here today.

993
00:53:50,707 --> 00:53:52,541
Maybe again next year at Sears Point.

994
00:53:52,751 --> 00:53:55,878
Oh hey, when is Sears Point, this year?

995
00:53:57,881 --> 00:54:00,924
(background chatter)

996
00:54:04,095 --> 00:54:05,471
Did you see that?

997
00:54:06,806 --> 00:54:08,015
It's ol' Rick Nifty.

998
00:54:08,224 --> 00:54:09,016
Rick Nifty.

999
00:54:10,852 --> 00:54:12,311
Old buddy of mine.

1000
00:54:14,314 --> 00:54:17,399
(chuckles) It ain't even
legal I got him so panicked.

1001
00:54:17,609 --> 00:54:18,901
Only way that dude's gonna see the finish

1002
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:20,944
is to get in my draft.

1003
00:54:21,154 --> 00:54:23,822
I'm gonna blow that son of a
bitch right off the course.

1004
00:54:24,032 --> 00:54:25,574
- Hey hold it, Halsy.

1005
00:54:25,784 --> 00:54:26,784
- He just better watch his ass.

1006
00:54:26,993 --> 00:54:28,202
- You just better watch yours, man.

1007
00:54:28,411 --> 00:54:29,369
- What they ought to do is to pay me extra

1008
00:54:29,579 --> 00:54:30,662
just for making it interesting.

1009
00:54:30,872 --> 00:54:32,289
That's what these square-jaws
want, is to see the real

1010
00:54:32,499 --> 00:54:34,082
muscle fighting it out!

1011
00:54:34,292 --> 00:54:37,211
Two top fast go-getters,
fightin' it out to the finish.

1012
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:39,129
- The world starring Halsy Knox.

1013
00:54:39,339 --> 00:54:40,881
- How's that, Lady Godiva?

1014
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:42,382
(cacophonous engine revving)

1015
00:54:42,592 --> 00:54:45,886
(drowned by out engines)

1016
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:58,398
- [Voiceover] Go!

1017
00:55:02,195 --> 00:55:05,948
(muffled announcement system)

1018
00:55:33,518 --> 00:55:35,269
- [Voiceover] This could
be an upset because Nifty

1019
00:55:35,478 --> 00:55:37,187
is not used to being behind!

1020
00:55:37,397 --> 00:55:41,441
(distorted and muffled
announcement system)

1021
00:55:45,113 --> 00:55:45,988
- [Voiceover] Look at him go!

1022
00:55:46,197 --> 00:55:48,240
Oh, and there goes Fauss!

1023
00:55:48,449 --> 00:55:50,742
Fauss gets a California bath!

1024
00:55:58,877 --> 00:56:01,920
- No scot-roddy Rick Nifty Van
Dooz and Jim Dandy Sinclair's

1025
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:05,799
gonna lift his leg on
me and get away with it.

1026
00:56:06,009 --> 00:56:07,467
That bastard think he's the
only one who ever been up to

1027
00:56:07,677 --> 00:56:08,552
Sears Point?

1028
00:56:10,513 --> 00:56:12,639
- When were you at Sears, Hals?

1029
00:56:12,849 --> 00:56:14,850
- He don't know I wasn't
ever at Sears Point.

1030
00:56:15,059 --> 00:56:17,436
It rained the year I was at Sears Point.

1031
00:56:17,645 --> 00:56:21,398
Drove all the way up to 'Frisco,
got up there and it rained.

1032
00:56:21,608 --> 00:56:25,861
- I heard they raced
race or shine up there.

1033
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:28,488
- Not if there are earthquakes.

1034
00:56:31,075 --> 00:56:31,950
Who couldn't win a race?

1035
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,119
You fly in the morning,
you fly out at night.

1036
00:56:34,329 --> 00:56:38,040
You got the top tuners
workin' the top bikes for ya.

1037
00:56:38,249 --> 00:56:40,959
- You carried your mad
into that race, Halsy.

1038
00:56:41,169 --> 00:56:43,629
Which is the dumbest thing,
man, that anybody could do.

1039
00:56:43,838 --> 00:56:45,505
- I gotta get me a sponsor.

1040
00:56:45,715 --> 00:56:46,673
I gotta get me a sponsor.

1041
00:56:46,883 --> 00:56:48,425
- And that's where you goofed, you know?

1042
00:56:48,635 --> 00:56:49,593
- Somebody who knows bikes

1043
00:56:49,802 --> 00:56:51,303
much less throttle return springs.

1044
00:56:51,512 --> 00:56:53,847
- That throttle return spring was perfect.

1045
00:56:54,057 --> 00:56:55,182
- Man, I couldn't have
stopped nowhere in that

1046
00:56:55,391 --> 00:56:57,476
Micky Mouse scooter of yours, Little.

1047
00:56:57,685 --> 00:56:59,561
- Yeah, you missed the trail, man.

1048
00:56:59,771 --> 00:57:02,314
Hey, you can't ride, that's it.

1049
00:57:02,523 --> 00:57:03,649
You can't ride.

1050
00:57:09,364 --> 00:57:12,991
(melancholic country music)

1051
00:57:18,706 --> 00:57:22,834
♫ True love is greater than friendship

1052
00:57:26,047 --> 00:57:28,006
♫ That's right

1053
00:57:28,216 --> 00:57:32,010
♫ Even though it's seems wrong

1054
00:57:34,263 --> 00:57:37,724
♫ And before I'll see you

1055
00:57:39,102 --> 00:57:42,312
♫ Hurt her anymore

1056
00:57:42,522 --> 00:57:46,149
♫ I'll just hold to her love

1057
00:57:46,359 --> 00:57:49,152
♫ But I'll be gone

1058
00:57:51,572 --> 00:57:55,200
♫ You don't really want her

1059
00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:58,745
♫ You're playin' a game

1060
00:57:58,955 --> 00:58:01,415
♫ Oh you use her

1061
00:58:01,624 --> 00:58:04,584
♫ And drag her along

1062
00:58:07,171 --> 00:58:10,632
♫ And before I'll see you

1063
00:58:11,884 --> 00:58:15,178
♫ Hurt her anymore

1064
00:58:15,388 --> 00:58:19,099
♫ I'll just hold to her love

1065
00:58:19,308 --> 00:58:22,102
♫ But I'll be gone

1066
00:58:24,022 --> 00:58:27,816
♫ You'll use her, abuse her

1067
00:58:28,026 --> 00:58:32,070
♫ Mistreat her then leave her ♫

1068
00:58:34,198 --> 00:58:38,535
- Hey what, are you drinking
all the beer, old buddy?

1069
00:58:38,745 --> 00:58:41,621
(repeated clunking)

1070
00:59:12,987 --> 00:59:15,363
Well it's on your side, dude.

1071
00:59:16,616 --> 00:59:18,325
- [Little] Naturally.

1072
00:59:30,296 --> 00:59:33,924
(woman humming melodically)

1073
00:59:39,889 --> 00:59:40,680
- Halsy?

1074
00:59:43,726 --> 00:59:44,518
- Whaty?

1075
00:59:45,603 --> 00:59:46,394
- Whaty?

1076
00:59:49,899 --> 00:59:51,149
- Never mind, what?

1077
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:53,193
- [Little] What's whaty?
- [Halsy] Never mind, damnit.

1078
00:59:53,402 --> 00:59:54,027
What do you want?

1079
00:59:54,237 --> 00:59:57,572
Didn't you ever say whaty
when someone said your name?

1080
00:59:57,782 --> 01:00:01,034
(woman hums melodically)

1081
01:00:02,036 --> 01:00:03,703
- I just want to tell you somethin'.

1082
01:00:03,913 --> 01:00:05,539
- [Halsy] Okay, what?

1083
01:00:07,166 --> 01:00:09,876
- Hey, what I was wonderin'
is when your suspension's up.

1084
01:00:10,086 --> 01:00:10,710
- What are you homesick?

1085
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:14,131
If you're homesick, go home if you want.

1086
01:00:15,341 --> 01:00:17,259
- No, I want my...

1087
01:00:17,468 --> 01:00:20,220
I want my bike back, I
want my license back.

1088
01:00:20,429 --> 01:00:21,138
And uh.

1089
01:00:22,223 --> 01:00:23,932
I wanna be Little again, you know?

1090
01:00:24,142 --> 01:00:25,600
- Sure, man, screw it, right away.

1091
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:27,352
I don't give a damn.

1092
01:00:28,855 --> 01:00:30,522
- You don't have to be dragged about it.

1093
01:00:30,731 --> 01:00:32,732
- They'll cancel my suspension
and I'll pay my dues anyway.

1094
01:00:32,942 --> 01:00:34,568
Don't worry about me.

1095
01:00:39,073 --> 01:00:40,532
- It's just my leg's better, that's all.

1096
01:00:40,741 --> 01:00:43,785
- I'm not bugged, who says I'm bugged?

1097
01:00:57,008 --> 01:00:58,592
Well you tell it true,
it ain't your gimpy leg

1098
01:00:58,801 --> 01:01:00,760
you want to exercise.

1099
01:01:00,970 --> 01:01:03,847
- I just wanna race is all.

1100
01:01:04,056 --> 01:01:05,098
- (spits) Sure, man.

1101
01:01:05,308 --> 01:01:06,141
It's your bike, you race it.

1102
01:01:06,350 --> 01:01:07,809
Only don't tell me it's
your bike you wanna race.

1103
01:01:08,019 --> 01:01:08,977
- Yeah, well what is it then?

1104
01:01:09,187 --> 01:01:10,187
- It's a chick.

1105
01:01:10,396 --> 01:01:12,439
- Yeah well, she ain't
your chick, you know that?

1106
01:01:12,648 --> 01:01:13,732
- She sure as hell ain't your chick.

1107
01:01:13,941 --> 01:01:16,026
- Uh yeah but it was my
idea to bring her along.

1108
01:01:16,235 --> 01:01:17,110
- Whose truck is it? Whose truck is it?

1109
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:18,987
- It's your truck but it's my
bike that's winnin' all the

1110
01:01:19,197 --> 01:01:21,114
races to pay for the food and the gas.

1111
01:01:21,324 --> 01:01:23,200
- Damnit, I'm tryin' to bust
my ass to score points for you

1112
01:01:23,409 --> 01:01:24,784
and you're trying to
take my chick from me.

1113
01:01:24,994 --> 01:01:27,162
- You're trying to take
my chick from me, man!

1114
01:01:27,371 --> 01:01:28,246
Anyway, you don't want her now,

1115
01:01:28,456 --> 01:01:31,333
except maybe that she aint' a whore.

1116
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:41,676
- Well if that's friendship, I'm aghast.

1117
01:01:41,886 --> 01:01:44,095
- I never said I was your friend, Halsy.

1118
01:01:44,305 --> 01:01:46,348
I don't even fuckin' like you.

1119
01:01:46,557 --> 01:01:48,141
- Oh, so he finally blurts it out.

1120
01:01:48,351 --> 01:01:49,935
- I don't have to blurt it,
I'm tellin' you cold and clear,

1121
01:01:50,144 --> 01:01:51,311
man, I don't like you.

1122
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:54,022
I never did and everything I
had to talk you about, man,

1123
01:01:54,232 --> 01:01:55,607
I had to think up.

1124
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:01,446
- Hey, we're gonna settle this, Little,

1125
01:02:01,656 --> 01:02:02,864
before I bust you in the face.

1126
01:02:03,074 --> 01:02:07,118
Maybe we better call out Rita
and see how she stands, huh?

1127
01:02:11,207 --> 01:02:12,332
Hey!

1128
01:02:12,541 --> 01:02:14,668
(whistles)

1129
01:02:34,188 --> 01:02:34,980
Ask her.

1130
01:03:21,819 --> 01:03:24,195
(car starts)

1131
01:03:45,718 --> 01:03:48,345
(clears throat)

1132
01:05:10,219 --> 01:05:12,137
- Little, I got it.

1133
01:05:12,346 --> 01:05:14,722
Little, see here it is, like I told you.

1134
01:05:14,932 --> 01:05:18,435
After you left with sideburns,
I found this in your room.

1135
01:05:18,644 --> 01:05:19,686
See?

1136
01:05:19,895 --> 01:05:22,105
The photographer's camera.

1137
01:05:22,314 --> 01:05:25,442
For all we know, sideburns
could have committed foul play

1138
01:05:25,651 --> 01:05:26,776
to get this.

1139
01:05:26,986 --> 01:05:29,654
And they could have took
you as his accomplice.

1140
01:05:29,864 --> 01:05:33,867
- He don't have to get
rough, old Halsy.

1141
01:05:34,076 --> 01:05:37,579
As long as nobody ever steps up and says,

1142
01:05:37,788 --> 01:05:40,874
''Hey man, you ain't tellin' the truth.''

1143
01:05:41,083 --> 01:05:44,544
That's what he's got goin' for him.

1144
01:05:44,753 --> 01:05:48,506
As long as nobody ever steps up and says,

1145
01:05:48,716 --> 01:05:49,424
''Hey.

1146
01:05:50,509 --> 01:05:53,553
''That ain't what you said yesterday.''

1147
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:55,472
You know?

1148
01:06:00,186 --> 01:06:02,187
- What, where...

1149
01:06:02,396 --> 01:06:04,105
What was I saying? Oh.

1150
01:06:06,692 --> 01:06:07,901
(sighs)

1151
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:10,236
I'd just as soon have died.

1152
01:06:12,406 --> 01:06:15,533
Half the time I thought I did already.

1153
01:06:17,578 --> 01:06:21,539
Then I'd hear conversations
with other bodies.

1154
01:06:21,749 --> 01:06:22,582
''Are you dead?''

1155
01:06:22,791 --> 01:06:24,250
''Oh yeah, are you?''

1156
01:06:27,254 --> 01:06:30,298
And that's when I knew that I wasn't.

1157
01:06:32,468 --> 01:06:35,553
They bored two holes in
my head and it was...

1158
01:06:35,763 --> 01:06:38,139
It was pulling my head in one
direction and feet in another

1159
01:06:38,349 --> 01:06:40,934
and they was turnin' me over
every half hour like some

1160
01:06:41,143 --> 01:06:43,311
barbecued chicken on a spit.

1161
01:06:44,271 --> 01:06:47,774
Just to keep my poor
old spine from saggin'.

1162
01:06:47,983 --> 01:06:51,027
- [Rita] People die with broken backs.

1163
01:06:52,071 --> 01:06:53,780
- Usually people die.

1164
01:06:54,990 --> 01:06:57,200
But sometimes things happen

1165
01:06:59,078 --> 01:07:01,496
that aren't usual, I mean a
guy can fall off a 12-story

1166
01:07:01,705 --> 01:07:03,122
building and he don't die.

1167
01:07:03,332 --> 01:07:05,416
I fall down five steps
and I break my neck.

1168
01:07:05,626 --> 01:07:09,754
And all because of some dumb
broad named Bunny Patchen.

1169
01:07:09,964 --> 01:07:11,714
It was hot and I was runnin'
from the bathroom to the

1170
01:07:11,924 --> 01:07:14,676
bedroom, you know, and it
must have been the excitement

1171
01:07:14,885 --> 01:07:18,513
of the big date and all because
I got to feelin' kinda dizzy

1172
01:07:18,722 --> 01:07:20,723
and the next thing I know
I'm fallin' down these stairs

1173
01:07:20,933 --> 01:07:24,811
and then I'm in the
intensive care on that spit.

1174
01:07:27,064 --> 01:07:31,192
And then a bodycast, I was in
a bodycast for three months.

1175
01:07:34,196 --> 01:07:36,614
And all I get from old Bunny
Patchen is this get well card

1176
01:07:36,824 --> 01:07:37,907
saying ''Oh I'm sorry, Halsy.

1177
01:07:38,117 --> 01:07:40,451
''Just can't work out between
us due to the fact of all the

1178
01:07:40,661 --> 01:07:44,122
''things you place so much
importance on and I don't.''

1179
01:07:44,331 --> 01:07:46,165
- Yeah, I know, same thing happened--

1180
01:07:46,375 --> 01:07:48,626
- No it didn't happen to you,
damnit, it happened to me.

1181
01:07:48,836 --> 01:07:49,919
It didn't happen to you.

1182
01:07:50,129 --> 01:07:52,755
- What I mean is, you're
looking to be responded to.

1183
01:07:52,965 --> 01:07:54,048
- Oh, bullshit.

1184
01:07:54,258 --> 01:07:55,842
- Not call bullshit.

1185
01:07:56,051 --> 01:07:58,011
It's called moving off your center.

1186
01:07:58,220 --> 01:08:00,471
- If I told you I was being
tortured by wild Persian tribes

1187
01:08:00,681 --> 01:08:02,348
while I was travelling
around the world for the FBI

1188
01:08:02,558 --> 01:08:04,058
you'd listen to me but
I told you the truth

1189
01:08:04,268 --> 01:08:05,602
and you wasn't listenin'.

1190
01:08:05,811 --> 01:08:07,061
You wasn't listenin'.

1191
01:08:07,271 --> 01:08:09,314
So what good is the truth?

1192
01:08:14,862 --> 01:08:18,656
(loud motorcycle engines)

1193
01:08:18,866 --> 01:08:19,657
Turn right!

1194
01:08:22,244 --> 01:08:25,121

1195
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:32,545
(chatter drowned out by engines)

1196
01:08:42,514 --> 01:08:43,973

line, folks and officially

1197

here is the results, first it's Ken Lomen,

third Don Dimaonds.

1199

1201
01:09:12,378 --> 01:09:13,836
- He asked me where my Mars was.

1202
01:09:14,046 --> 01:09:15,797
Keeped on bugging me about
my Mars and I tell where my

1203
01:09:16,006 --> 01:09:18,049
Mars is, now you come out
with where's my Venus.

1204
01:09:18,258 --> 01:09:19,967
- Shh, please be quiet?

1205
01:09:20,177 --> 01:09:22,053
- What's the matter, am
I making you nervous?

1206
01:09:22,262 --> 01:09:23,971
- You're moving me very much
off my center the last few--

1207
01:09:24,181 --> 01:09:25,848
- Oh hey, babe, I don't
know about your center.

1208
01:09:26,058 --> 01:09:27,100
I don't know where your center is,

1209
01:09:27,309 --> 01:09:29,477
I don't know where my planets
are, I just know we're broke.

1210
01:09:29,687 --> 01:09:31,187
Unless you come up with something
here today besides these

1211
01:09:31,397 --> 01:09:34,399
bottle caps and pennies,
I'm gonna hock this toy.

1212
01:09:34,608 --> 01:09:37,777
- You hock your own toy,
sonny, you don't hawk mine!

1213
01:09:37,986 --> 01:09:41,155
- Hey wait a minute,
you mean hock my bike?

1214
01:09:41,365 --> 01:09:41,989
Hm?

1215
01:09:42,199 --> 01:09:45,952
- You haven't made dime
once since you went 100%.

1216
01:09:46,161 --> 01:09:48,204
I thought that ought
to tell you somethin'.

1217
01:09:48,414 --> 01:09:51,582
- What? Okay, what ought to tell me what?

1218
01:09:51,792 --> 01:09:53,167
- You need Little.

1219
01:09:56,463 --> 01:09:59,841
(approaching motorcycle)

1220
01:10:08,809 --> 01:10:09,851
- You did it!

1221
01:10:12,062 --> 01:10:13,980
Little Little, oh!

1222
01:10:14,189 --> 01:10:14,897
Little!

1223
01:10:15,107 --> 01:10:16,482
Woo-hoo, Little!

1224
01:10:16,692 --> 01:10:19,152
That's your best time yet, son!

1225
01:10:20,654 --> 01:10:23,072
You broke your own record.

1226
01:10:23,282 --> 01:10:24,824
- Well, I couldn't have
done it without you

1227
01:10:25,033 --> 01:10:27,160
and your flag, Ma.
- [Mom] Oh, you.

1228
01:10:27,369 --> 01:10:29,287
I'll get you! (laughing)

1229
01:10:29,496 --> 01:10:31,247
Get away from you, Little. (laughs)

1230
01:10:31,457 --> 01:10:32,832
I'm gonna get you, Little!

1231
01:10:33,041 --> 01:10:34,292

Hey, Ma.

1233
01:10:36,086 --> 01:10:38,296
Hey, Ma, quit foolin' around!

1234
01:10:38,505 --> 01:10:40,214

and damnit that's a bad trait.

1275
01:12:47,926 --> 01:12:50,386
People want to be responded to.

1276
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:52,680
Looky here, I gotta bend over backwards

1277
01:12:52,890 --> 01:12:54,765
just to catch your eyes.

1278
01:12:59,021 --> 01:13:01,439
I was sayin' to Rita this mornin',

1279
01:13:01,648 --> 01:13:03,608
''Boy is real with old Little,
that's gonna be a tough one.''

1280
01:13:03,817 --> 01:13:05,443
But damnit, worth it.

1281
01:13:20,334 --> 01:13:22,627
- Hey Rita, how are ya?

1282
01:13:22,836 --> 01:13:23,711
- I'm fine, Little.

1283
01:13:23,921 --> 01:13:25,421
How are you?

1284
01:13:25,631 --> 01:13:27,673
- I'm fine too, thank you.

1285
01:13:30,010 --> 01:13:34,138
(Halsy clears throat dramatically)

1286
01:13:35,933 --> 01:13:36,641
When did you get that?

1287
01:13:36,850 --> 01:13:41,228
- I wondered when the heck
you were gonna notice.

1288
01:13:41,438 --> 01:13:44,273
- Ridin' sidehack now huh, who with?

1289
01:13:44,483 --> 01:13:47,860
- Well, old Jimmy Fast got
killed up at Corganville

1290
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:50,529
and his wife said ''Here, take it.''

1291
01:13:50,739 --> 01:13:53,783
Said she never wanted to see it again.

1292
01:13:53,992 --> 01:13:55,117
- How's Herera?

1293
01:13:56,161 --> 01:13:59,163
- I gave him Rita's Geiger
counter for his half.

1294
01:13:59,373 --> 01:14:01,624
- No I mean, how is he?

1295
01:14:01,833 --> 01:14:05,544
- Well he's great,
except he's got no nose.

1296
01:14:05,754 --> 01:14:06,545
- Well, uh.

1297
01:14:07,798 --> 01:14:10,174
Who you ridin' sidehack with?

1298
01:14:11,176 --> 01:14:14,804
- Well I truly hoped that it
was gonna be my old friend

1299
01:14:15,013 --> 01:14:16,180
Little Fauss!

1300
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:17,264
- Hey.

1301
01:14:17,474 --> 01:14:19,475
You might tell him half that thing's mine.

1302
01:14:19,685 --> 01:14:22,895
You know, my Geiger counter paid for it.

1303
01:14:45,627 --> 01:14:47,086
- Man, we couldn't hustle up enough loot

1304
01:14:47,295 --> 01:14:51,340
to hustle up a doctor soon
enough and now it's too late.

1305
01:14:52,259 --> 01:14:54,176
And hell I'd marry her like that!

1306
01:14:54,386 --> 01:14:56,012
Except they just caught up
with me for non-support on one

1307
01:14:56,221 --> 01:14:58,514
family and hell I don't even
know if I'm divorced yet!

1308
01:14:58,724 --> 01:14:59,348
Hell, you know me.

1309
01:14:59,558 --> 01:15:02,351
I'm not the kind of guy who
can just cut out on some girl.

1310
01:15:02,561 --> 01:15:05,730
And well, still rememberin'
how much in love that you two

1311
01:15:05,939 --> 01:15:08,065
were I just kinda figured
I'd maybe just step right out

1312
01:15:08,275 --> 01:15:10,192
of your ways if you thought
you might wanna get together

1313
01:15:10,402 --> 01:15:13,779
and team up again, get somethin' goin'.

1314
01:15:13,989 --> 01:15:15,156
- You mean come back and be your tuner

1315
01:15:15,365 --> 01:15:19,410
and take a shot at Rita
every once in a while, right?

1316
01:15:20,412 --> 01:15:23,122
- Well you have a low mind, Little.

1317
01:15:23,331 --> 01:15:27,001
- You just wanna pawn
that chick off on me, man.

1318
01:15:27,210 --> 01:15:29,628
Well, that's how it is, right.

1319
01:15:29,838 --> 01:15:33,049
- Hey, I don't even know if it's my kid!

1320
01:15:35,469 --> 01:15:39,597
Sure, for all I know it
may even be your kid.

1321
01:15:39,806 --> 01:15:40,514
Yes, sir.

1322
01:15:42,184 --> 01:15:45,728
Man, she can't even
tell me whose kid it is!

1323
01:15:45,937 --> 01:15:48,230
It'd just break my heart
to give up poor Rita

1324
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:50,816
but if that's what I gotta do.

1325
01:15:52,235 --> 01:15:54,028
Be just like old times, you remember?

1326
01:15:54,237 --> 01:15:55,863
Lots of laughs, plenty of ass!

1327
01:15:56,073 --> 01:15:57,698
What do ya say, babe?

1328
01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:06,290
- I ain't a tuner anymore, I race.

1329
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:08,375
- I want you to race.

1330
01:16:08,585 --> 01:16:11,003
That's what I'm here for, I
need you to sidehack for me.

1331
01:16:11,213 --> 01:16:14,548
- Halsy, I ain't climbin' on
no sidehack to hold you down.

1332
01:16:14,758 --> 01:16:16,550
I race solo, 100%.

1333
01:16:21,473 --> 01:16:25,601
- She's havin' a baby, man,
and I don't have a dime.

1334
01:16:27,104 --> 01:16:30,064
- I'm goin' to San Francisco.

1335
01:16:30,273 --> 01:16:31,273
- Sears Point?

1336
01:16:31,483 --> 01:16:33,692
- That's all I'm gonna do.

1337
01:16:33,902 --> 01:16:36,278
I ain't ridin' sidehack no more,
I ain't gettin' screwed up,

1338
01:16:36,488 --> 01:16:40,533
I'm just goin' to Sears point
to race and screw people.

1339
01:17:41,928 --> 01:17:43,012
- Hey.

1340
01:17:43,221 --> 01:17:43,929
- Yeah?

1341
01:17:51,021 --> 01:17:51,812
Well?

1342
01:17:54,858 --> 01:17:56,650
- I'll make it a rule,

1343
01:17:57,819 --> 01:18:00,571
never to make no promises.

1344
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:01,488
- So?

1345
01:18:04,326 --> 01:18:06,160
- I just want you to know though that,

1346
01:18:06,369 --> 01:18:08,329
that you can count on me.

1347
01:18:10,123 --> 01:18:13,918
- I make it a rule, never
to count on anybody.

1348
01:18:15,712 --> 01:18:17,046
- Good.

1349
01:18:17,255 --> 01:18:19,381
Then maybe we'll get along.

1350
01:18:42,697 --> 01:18:44,240
(faint country music)
(approaching car)

1351
01:18:44,449 --> 01:18:48,911
♫ I don't wanna be tied to
a load that I can't carry

1352
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:51,330
♫ Just wanna hear that thunder roar

1353
01:18:51,539 --> 01:18:53,832
♫ On trails that ain't been rode before

1354
01:18:54,042 --> 01:18:57,836
♫ Don't put no chains on
me, I'm rollin' free ♫

(muffled radio chatter)

01:19:06,304 --> 01:19:09,348
(screaming)

1358
01:19:09,557 --> 01:19:10,933

1359
01:19:11,142 --> 01:19:15,187
(motorcycle engine)
(muffled radio chatter)

1360
01:19:19,401 --> 01:19:20,192
- Rita?

1361
01:19:21,569 --> 01:19:22,820
- [Voiceover] Then the next
rider up will be one of the

1362
01:19:23,029 --> 01:19:27,283
local favorites, Little
Fauss on number 191.

1363
01:19:27,492 --> 01:19:28,951
(motorcycle engine)

1364
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:32,371
There he goes, it looks like a good run.

1365
01:19:39,337 --> 01:19:40,379
- Oh, Little.

1366
01:19:47,178 --> 01:19:49,054
Whatever happened to...

1367
01:19:55,687 --> 01:19:57,730
Whatever happened to, oh.

1368
01:20:03,695 --> 01:20:05,279
(moans)

1369
01:20:05,488 --> 01:20:07,698
Whatever happened to, Halsy?

1370
01:20:12,954 --> 01:20:15,456
(Little groans)

1371
01:20:15,665 --> 01:20:17,791
- He knocked up some whore.

1372
01:20:19,252 --> 01:20:20,294
A while back.

1373
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:26,258
Yeah, well he probably
had to get married by now.

1374
01:20:26,468 --> 01:20:30,179
(cacophonous revving engines)

1375
01:20:31,681 --> 01:20:34,933
- [Halsy] Woo-hoo-hoo, we did it baby!

1376
01:20:35,143 --> 01:20:35,851
Hey.

1377
01:20:36,770 --> 01:20:38,812
- Just shut up, and hurry up.

1378
01:20:39,022 --> 01:20:40,314
- How are we doin'?

1379
01:20:40,523 --> 01:20:43,233
Easy, we got plenty of time.

1380
01:20:43,443 --> 01:20:44,568
Hold on, I got ya.

1381
01:20:44,778 --> 01:20:47,696
- First aid and big smiles is
not gonna get me through this.

1382
01:20:47,906 --> 01:20:49,865
- What a prima donna.

1383
01:20:50,075 --> 01:20:51,200
- You're supposed to exercise.

1384
01:20:51,409 --> 01:20:53,160
- I got you, babe.

1385
01:20:53,370 --> 01:20:55,329
- Supposed to exercise and eat.

1386
01:20:55,538 --> 01:20:56,955
And take breathing lessons.

1387
01:20:57,165 --> 01:20:58,415
And I didn't do any of it.

1388
01:20:58,625 --> 01:21:02,503
- Put that baby out of
there, huh, we're comin'!

1389
01:21:05,632 --> 01:21:08,300
I got ya, now just take it easy.

1390
01:21:08,510 --> 01:21:10,219
- [Voiceover] Hey Halsy, you
ain't gonna win this race!

1391
01:21:10,428 --> 01:21:12,221
- Huh, who the hell are you smartass?

1392
01:21:12,430 --> 01:21:13,472
How come I didn't see you?

1393
01:21:13,681 --> 01:21:17,726
I didn't see you 'cause you
was behind me, that's why!

1394
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:21,605
Easy now.
(Rita groans)

1395
01:21:21,815 --> 01:21:22,689
What the hell were you ridin'?

1396
01:21:22,899 --> 01:21:24,400
Take it easy, will ya?

1397
01:21:24,609 --> 01:21:26,485
I got the leg, I got it.

1398
01:21:28,154 --> 01:21:29,446
Hey!

1399
01:21:29,656 --> 01:21:31,031
Throw me that helmet, will ya, Jake?

1400
01:21:31,241 --> 01:21:32,866
Come on, man, I gotta get movin'.

1401
01:21:33,076 --> 01:21:34,743
Hey wait a minute.

1402
01:21:34,953 --> 01:21:36,078
Easy, I got it.

1403
01:21:38,623 --> 01:21:40,165
(car starts)

1404
01:21:40,375 --> 01:21:43,001
- [Voiceover] Okay mac, go ahead.

1405
01:21:44,712 --> 01:21:46,505
(Rita panting)

1406
01:21:46,714 --> 01:21:49,341
- I want somebody to call my father.

1407
01:21:49,551 --> 01:21:51,593
- No one needs to call your father, baby.

1408
01:21:51,803 --> 01:21:53,095
I'm right here.

1409
01:21:53,304 --> 01:21:54,513
I'm your father.

1410
01:21:57,100 --> 01:22:00,394
- If we, if we go to 'Frisco,
that's where they live.

1411
01:22:00,603 --> 01:22:02,020
We could call and blow their minds.

1412
01:22:02,230 --> 01:22:03,814
- (chuckles) We're gonna
go to 'Frisco, baby.

1413
01:22:04,023 --> 01:22:05,190
We're gonna blow your old man's mind

1414
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:07,276
and I'm gonna win the old 200.

1416

1417
01:22:10,655 --> 01:22:11,780
Can I help you?

1418
01:22:14,159 --> 01:22:15,033
- Mr. Knox.

1419
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:18,245
Are you Mr. Knox?

1420
01:22:20,165 --> 01:22:21,415
- What? Huh?

1421
01:22:21,624 --> 01:22:23,041
What? Uh-huh.

1422
01:22:23,251 --> 01:22:23,876
Why?

1423
01:22:24,085 --> 01:22:25,586
- Congratulations, it's
healthy six-pound baby girl.

1424
01:22:25,795 --> 01:22:27,171
- What? Huh?

1425
01:22:27,380 --> 01:22:28,839
- Your wife, Miss Nebraska.

1426
01:22:29,048 --> 01:22:29,673
- Yeah?

1427
01:22:29,883 --> 01:22:31,425
- She's asking to see you.

1428
01:22:31,634 --> 01:22:35,596
If you haven't (chuckles) split.

1429
01:22:42,353 --> 01:22:45,272

01:23:02,957 --> 01:23:07,085
(door creaks open)
(rooster crows)

1432
01:23:17,847 --> 01:23:21,099
- You guys. You can't even
say goodbye and thank you.

1433
01:23:21,309 --> 01:23:23,018
- I was gonna say goodbye
and thank you, Moneth,

1434
01:23:23,228 --> 01:23:26,021
but I thought I'd let you
get your beauty sleep.

1435
01:23:26,231 --> 01:23:27,689
- Yeah well if you see
your boyfriend down there,

1436
01:23:27,899 --> 01:23:31,109
you sure tell him he taught
you all the wrong things.

1437
01:23:31,319 --> 01:23:33,362
'Cause you two sure like to
leave a girl high and dry,

1438
01:23:33,571 --> 01:23:34,446
you know that?

1439
01:23:34,656 --> 01:23:36,198
- Could be you, Moneth, you know that?

1440
01:23:36,407 --> 01:23:37,533
- Who me?

1441
01:23:37,742 --> 01:23:40,452
- And uh, don't you ''you guys'' me.

1442
01:23:40,662 --> 01:23:41,703
'Cause I'm me.

1443
01:23:43,331 --> 01:23:46,083
- Yeah well maybe you used to
be but you sure ain't anymore,

1444
01:23:46,292 --> 01:23:46,959
you know that, Little?

1445
01:23:47,168 --> 01:23:48,961
- 'Cause Halsy and I ain't
even friends anymore,

1446
01:23:49,170 --> 01:23:51,964
much less what you say, boyfriends.

1447
01:23:54,259 --> 01:23:56,301
- Can't you just, please?

1448
01:23:57,845 --> 01:23:58,804
Say goodbye?

1449
01:24:01,474 --> 01:24:02,891
- Goodbye, Moneth.

1450
01:24:03,977 --> 01:24:06,603
- Sears Point, you big-time beguiler.

1451
01:24:06,813 --> 01:24:08,981
I long to enter your 200 miler.

1452
01:24:09,190 --> 01:24:12,359
Lest I forget, though
it's needless to mention.

1453
01:24:12,569 --> 01:24:16,113
Your cow-palace trade show
commands my attention!

1454
01:24:16,322 --> 01:24:19,449
Good to see Good Year
and Triumph and Harley.

1455
01:24:19,659 --> 01:24:23,287
Nixon and Balman and Oldham and Charlie.

1456
01:24:23,496 --> 01:24:26,206
Top hot shoes and go-fasters
all racin' together.

1457
01:24:26,416 --> 01:24:28,333
Despite of the mother-humping
California weather.

1458
01:24:28,543 --> 01:24:30,252
- They'll never print that.

1459
01:24:30,461 --> 01:24:32,796
- Oh, they printed all
them stories and articles

1460
01:24:33,006 --> 01:24:35,674
on how I cycled through South America.

1461
01:24:35,883 --> 01:24:38,010
- [Rita] India, India.
- [Halsy] Huh?

1462
01:24:38,219 --> 01:24:40,137
- You told me it was
India you cycled through,

1463
01:24:40,346 --> 01:24:41,305
not south America.
- [Halsy] Did I say India?

1464
01:24:41,514 --> 01:24:42,389
Oh that's right, it was.

1465
01:24:42,599 --> 01:24:43,849
That's right, it was India.

1466
01:24:44,058 --> 01:24:45,601
Turkey and Turkeystan.

1467
01:24:45,810 --> 01:24:46,935
All them places.

1468
01:24:47,145 --> 01:24:50,397
Burma.
(Rita chuckles)

1469
01:24:50,607 --> 01:24:51,648
There's the fuzz.

1470
01:24:51,858 --> 01:24:54,985
Fuzz is here, everybody's here!

1471
01:24:55,194 --> 01:24:58,989
God that is beautiful.
- [Rita] Yeah it sure is.

1472
01:25:08,666 --> 01:25:12,753
(Rita hums melodically)
(faint whistling wind)

1473
01:25:56,255 --> 01:25:59,883
(motorcycle engine revving)

1474
01:26:50,643 --> 01:26:55,272
(Rita humming melodically)
(faint whistling wind)

1475
01:26:55,481 --> 01:26:56,273
Is he here?

1476
01:26:58,067 --> 01:26:59,192
- [Halsy] Huh?
- [Rita] Is he here?

1477
01:26:59,402 --> 01:27:02,279
- Who?
(Rita groans)

1478
01:27:03,448 --> 01:27:06,074
Hey.
(Rita hums melodically)

1479
01:27:06,284 --> 01:27:10,912
All I'm lookin' for out of
this is a factory contract.

1480
01:27:11,122 --> 01:27:11,955
I'm just tired.

1481
01:27:12,165 --> 01:27:15,167
I'm tired of leanin' on
dealers all over the country.

1482
01:27:15,376 --> 01:27:17,252
To ride them name-brands
in every fairground

1483
01:27:17,462 --> 01:27:20,213
and county fairs all over the country.

1484
01:27:20,423 --> 01:27:24,384
Just to get on some factory
team at 40 or $60,000 a year.

1485
01:27:24,594 --> 01:27:27,387
That's all Sears Point means to me.

1486
01:27:29,182 --> 01:27:30,640
- [Voiceover] Let's play
dealer wins, it's my beer.

1487
01:27:30,850 --> 01:27:33,518
(overlapping conversation)

1488
01:27:33,728 --> 01:27:35,353
- Come on, Halsy, deal.

1489
01:27:35,563 --> 01:27:37,147
Come on, Frank, put 'em up.

1490
01:27:37,356 --> 01:27:39,733
- All right, man, let's go.

1491
01:27:39,942 --> 01:27:41,401
- Everybody in?

1492
01:27:41,611 --> 01:27:42,903
- [Voiceover] Hell, I
thought we were bein' raided.

1493
01:27:43,112 --> 01:27:45,071
Is poker legal in California or what?

1494
01:27:45,281 --> 01:27:47,157
- Lock the door will ya, babe?

1495
01:27:47,366 --> 01:27:50,577
- I ran into an old friend
of yours downstairs.

1496
01:27:50,787 --> 01:27:51,912
- Who?

1497
01:27:52,121 --> 01:27:54,080
- I asked him to come up.

1498
01:27:55,458 --> 01:27:56,875
(Halsy burps)

1499
01:27:57,084 --> 01:28:00,045
(background chatter)

1500
01:28:03,591 --> 01:28:05,550
Well, if ain't Little Fauss my old tuner.

1501
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:06,968
Good deal.

1502
01:28:08,012 --> 01:28:09,346
How are ya?

1503
01:28:09,555 --> 01:28:10,472
Come on in, grab a chair.

1504
01:28:10,681 --> 01:28:13,225
(muffled background chatter)

1505
01:28:13,434 --> 01:28:14,267
- Who's into who?

1506
01:28:14,477 --> 01:28:15,268
Somebody's into somebody.

1507
01:28:15,478 --> 01:28:17,103
Do you want a beer?

1508
01:28:17,313 --> 01:28:20,065
You know Rita, oh yeah, you seen our kid?

1509
01:28:20,274 --> 01:28:21,942
- Yeah, you got a nice baby.

1510
01:28:22,151 --> 01:28:23,276
- Thank you, well how do you know, man?

1511
01:28:23,486 --> 01:28:26,363
You haven't even seen
her, she's over here.

1512
01:28:26,572 --> 01:28:28,615
- I seen her when your old
lady dragged me up here.

1513
01:28:28,825 --> 01:28:29,908
- There's nothin' like a kid in the world.

1514
01:28:30,117 --> 01:28:31,326
Nothin' like a kid.

1515
01:28:31,536 --> 01:28:32,536
- [Voiceover] Are you playin' or not?

1516
01:28:32,745 --> 01:28:34,246
- Yeah, hell I'm in.

1517
01:28:34,455 --> 01:28:35,956
- [Voiceover] Get in or get out.

1518
01:28:36,165 --> 01:28:37,833
- So you're in cockroach manner too, huh?

1519
01:28:38,042 --> 01:28:40,919
That's what I call this
place, cockroach manner.

1520
01:28:41,128 --> 01:28:42,212
- It's ritzy enough for me.

1521
01:28:42,421 --> 01:28:43,129
- Huh?

1522
01:28:44,090 --> 01:28:45,257
What?

1523
01:28:45,466 --> 01:28:47,425
- Ritzy enough for me.

1524
01:28:47,635 --> 01:28:50,011
- Oh no, man, I'm only kiddin'.

1525
01:28:50,221 --> 01:28:51,805
Sure, it's beautiful.

1526
01:28:52,014 --> 01:28:52,722
TV.

1527
01:28:55,768 --> 01:28:57,310
You're only in San
Francisco once, I always say

1528
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:00,438
and all my friends are here.

1529
01:29:00,648 --> 01:29:02,440
- I better get some sleep
if I wanna get some practice

1530
01:29:02,650 --> 01:29:04,442
laps in in the morning.

1531
01:29:06,362 --> 01:29:07,737
- Yeah man, sure.

1532
01:29:08,906 --> 01:29:11,283
You better get some sleep.

1533
01:29:11,492 --> 01:29:13,076
- [Voiceover] I'll go two
bucks just to get you out.

1534
01:29:13,286 --> 01:29:14,870
- [Voiceover] Okay, I'll see you for two.

1535
01:29:15,079 --> 01:29:17,581
- Me, I do all my
partying before the race.

1536
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:22,002
Then I'm so hungover all I
wanna do is get that race over.

1537
01:29:22,211 --> 01:29:23,879
Damned if I don't race better
just tryin' to get that race

1538
01:29:24,088 --> 01:29:25,422
over and back on the road.

1539
01:29:25,631 --> 01:29:27,007
- [Voiceover] I'll raise you a half.

1540
01:29:27,216 --> 01:29:30,427
- It's just another greasy spoon, right?

1541
01:29:32,763 --> 01:29:34,514
- You don't think big, Little.

1542
01:29:34,724 --> 01:29:38,018
That's your problem, probably
from racin' dirt too much.

1543
01:29:38,227 --> 01:29:40,645
No more suckin' around for
tires and candy-ass spark plugs

1544
01:29:40,855 --> 01:29:42,814
for me, babe, no sir.

1545
01:29:43,024 --> 01:29:45,859
One year in the national
circuit, then out.

1546
01:29:46,068 --> 01:29:47,402
Out while I'm on top.

1547
01:29:47,612 --> 01:29:50,196
Go on TV as a famous sports celebrity.

1548
01:29:50,406 --> 01:29:51,948
Racin' ain't the only way to make money.

1549
01:29:52,158 --> 01:29:53,283
- [Voiceover] The dealer folds.

1550
01:29:53,492 --> 01:29:55,452
- Best of luck to you.

1551
01:29:55,661 --> 01:29:57,037
- I was even sayin' to old
Rita I thought we might go up

1552
01:29:57,246 --> 01:30:01,207
and visit her folks and
kinda make 'em feel good.

1553
01:30:02,293 --> 01:30:04,294
- You got a kind heart, you know that?

1554
01:30:04,503 --> 01:30:06,671
- [Voiceover] All right
deal it, man, let's go.

1555
01:30:06,881 --> 01:30:07,964
- Hey, it's not my deal.

1556
01:30:08,174 --> 01:30:10,216
Damnit, whose deal is it anyway?

1557
01:30:10,426 --> 01:30:12,594
I ain't runnin' a casino around here.

1558
01:30:12,803 --> 01:30:15,805
How's she supposed to get any sleep?

1559
01:30:16,015 --> 01:30:17,223
- [Voiceover] Somebody grab the cards.

1560
01:30:17,433 --> 01:30:18,808
- [Voiceover] Yeah, see ya.

1561
01:30:19,018 --> 01:30:22,520
(overlapping background chatter)

1562
01:30:22,730 --> 01:30:23,730
See ya later, Paul.

1563
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:25,190
- [Halsy] Paul? What you talkin' about?

1564
01:30:25,399 --> 01:30:26,608
It's Halsy, man!

1565
01:30:28,277 --> 01:30:30,987
- [Voiceover] See you later, man.

1566
01:30:37,453 --> 01:30:38,828
- How you doin', Rita?

1567
01:30:39,038 --> 01:30:40,664
- I'm doin' good, Little,
how are you doin'?

1568
01:30:40,873 --> 01:30:41,957
- [Little] All right.
- [Rita] That's good.

1569
01:30:42,166 --> 01:30:43,792
What's happenin'?
- [Little] Draft board got me.

1570
01:30:44,001 --> 01:30:45,961
- Uh, thought you said you had to go home

1571
01:30:46,170 --> 01:30:47,629
and get some sleep, Little?

1572
01:30:47,838 --> 01:30:50,882
- Draft board's got me, I got drafted.

1573
01:30:53,719 --> 01:30:56,638
- Crash your bike, man, get reclassified.

1574
01:30:56,847 --> 01:30:59,641
- You mean, hurt myself on purpose?

1575
01:31:01,268 --> 01:31:03,269
- That's what I done.

1576
01:31:03,479 --> 01:31:04,980
- I don't feature that.

1577
01:31:05,189 --> 01:31:06,815
I don't feature that.

1578
01:31:08,442 --> 01:31:10,986
(Halsy groans)

1579
01:31:13,781 --> 01:31:17,075
- [Halsy] Except when you go
to wreck yourself a little,

1580
01:31:17,284 --> 01:31:20,078
you end up wreckin' yourself a lot.

1581
01:31:21,956 --> 01:31:23,999
(chimes)

1582
01:31:26,669 --> 01:31:27,502
- [Voiceover] Operator.

1583
01:31:27,712 --> 01:31:30,005
- Operator, I'd like to
make a long-distance call

1584
01:31:30,214 --> 01:31:31,798
to Pebble Beach, California.

1585
01:31:32,008 --> 01:31:33,299
- [Voiceover] What's the caller's estate?

1586
01:31:33,509 --> 01:31:34,259
- Uh, to the country club.

1587
01:31:34,468 --> 01:31:35,176
- [Voiceover] Do you have the number?

1588
01:31:35,386 --> 01:31:36,720
- No, I don't know the number.

1589
01:31:36,929 --> 01:31:40,265
And that's person-to-person
to Mr. and Mrs. Jack Nebraska.

1590
01:31:40,474 --> 01:31:42,559
- [Voiceover] That'll be 75 cents, please.

1591
01:31:42,768 --> 01:31:43,476
- Okay.

1592
01:31:48,524 --> 01:31:50,859
(rattling)

1593
01:31:51,068 --> 01:31:52,360
- [Voiceover] 25 cents more, please.

1594
01:31:52,570 --> 01:31:55,697
- Just a minute, I'm comin' up with it.

1595
01:31:57,408 --> 01:31:59,367
- [Voiceover] Thank you.

1596
01:32:01,328 --> 01:32:03,538
- [Voiceover] Hello, who is it?

1597
01:32:03,748 --> 01:32:04,622
- It's Rita.

1598
01:32:04,832 --> 01:32:05,665
- [Voiceover] Would you speak up?

1599
01:32:05,875 --> 01:32:08,084
I'm sorry I can't hear you,
we got a bad connection here.

1600
01:32:08,294 --> 01:32:09,335
Who is it?

1601
01:32:09,545 --> 01:32:10,253
- Rita!

1602
01:32:48,793 --> 01:32:49,834
- She's gone.

1603
01:32:51,962 --> 01:32:52,754
- Who?

1604
01:32:55,382 --> 01:32:56,424
- (chuckles) Oh, who?

1605
01:32:56,634 --> 01:32:58,176
Who do you think, man? Rita.

1606
01:32:58,385 --> 01:32:59,511
She cut, split.

1607
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:04,099
- She's not with me.

1608
01:33:04,308 --> 01:33:06,309
- Oh no, I know she's not with you, man.

1609
01:33:06,519 --> 01:33:09,854
What's she gonna do with
you if she cut out on me?

1610
01:33:10,064 --> 01:33:11,356
- She didn't even say goodbye?

1611
01:33:11,565 --> 01:33:12,607
(Halsy laughs)

1612
01:33:12,817 --> 01:33:13,650
- Who cares?

1613
01:33:13,859 --> 01:33:14,943
Screw her.

1614
01:33:15,152 --> 01:33:17,445
Once a whore, always a whore.

1615
01:33:20,407 --> 01:33:21,282
Hey.

1616
01:33:21,492 --> 01:33:22,367
What would you say to somethin' to eat?

1617
01:33:22,576 --> 01:33:23,618
Let's get somethin' to eat, how about it?

1618
01:33:23,828 --> 01:33:25,036
Some greasy spoon out there.

1619
01:33:25,246 --> 01:33:26,496
Come on!
- [Little] I ate.

1620
01:33:26,705 --> 01:33:27,872
- Come on, have a cup of coffee with me.

1621
01:33:28,082 --> 01:33:28,873
- I had coffee too.

1622
01:33:29,083 --> 01:33:31,084
- Oh well then have crumb,
hell have a toothpick.

1623
01:33:31,293 --> 01:33:33,753
Come on, watch me eat, come on.

1624
01:33:34,964 --> 01:33:38,550
I turned down Suzuki, did I tell ya?

1625
01:33:38,759 --> 01:33:39,968
- Good for you.

1626
01:33:40,177 --> 01:33:41,928
- Told them to take their
contract and shove it.

1627
01:33:42,138 --> 01:33:45,265
Ain't nobody gonna run
my life like that, man.

1628
01:33:45,474 --> 01:33:46,349
- All right.

1629
01:33:47,643 --> 01:33:50,770
- Sponsorship is nowhere, man.

1630
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:51,688
Politics.

1631
01:33:52,773 --> 01:33:53,982
- That's right.

1632
01:33:58,529 --> 01:33:59,320
I had...

1633
01:34:00,865 --> 01:34:03,074
I had this offer to go race in Europe.

1634
01:34:03,284 --> 01:34:04,826
- [Little] Uh-huh.

1635
01:34:05,035 --> 01:34:07,537
- I had to turn it down
because of Rita and the kid.

1636
01:34:07,746 --> 01:34:08,454
Shit.

1637
01:34:09,915 --> 01:34:13,376
- You didn't have no offers, Halsy.

1638
01:34:13,586 --> 01:34:16,462
- Hey ma'am, can I have some coffee?

1639
01:34:17,715 --> 01:34:19,465
- Man, what a day for
her to leave on, huh?

1640
01:34:19,675 --> 01:34:20,383
- Oh no.

1641
01:34:22,011 --> 01:34:24,220
If a chick's gonna go she's
gonna go on your birthday

1642
01:34:24,430 --> 01:34:26,764
or on Christmas Eve, they
got their timin' down.

1643
01:34:26,974 --> 01:34:28,641
They know just when to cut ya.

1644
01:34:28,851 --> 01:34:29,475
- Hey, how's it goin', Halsy?

1645
01:34:29,685 --> 01:34:30,852
- Hey, what do you say, babe.

1646
01:34:31,061 --> 01:34:32,937
Are you hot today?
- [Voiceover] Yeah!

1647
01:34:33,147 --> 01:34:35,773
- 'Frisco. We made it, didn't we?

1648
01:34:37,860 --> 01:34:40,486
It ain't how you do, babe.

1649
01:34:40,696 --> 01:34:44,991
It's where you been, ain't
you learned that yet?

1650
01:34:45,201 --> 01:34:47,160
- It's how you do, Halsy.

1651
01:34:48,746 --> 01:34:51,039
- [Voiceover] With the temperature
here on the track at 111

1652
01:34:51,248 --> 01:34:52,874
degrees and under cloudless skies,

1653
01:34:53,083 --> 01:34:54,500
a North American Grand Prix.

1654
01:34:54,710 --> 01:34:57,337
Already we have a large crowd
to witness a professional

1655
01:34:57,546 --> 01:34:59,881
motorcycle road race and
we have people spaced

1656
01:35:00,090 --> 01:35:02,383
all over this race track
high on the hillsides

1657
01:35:02,593 --> 01:35:04,844
at the north edge of San
Francisco Bay here at beautiful

1658
01:35:05,054 --> 01:35:07,180
Sears Point International Raceway.

1659
01:35:07,389 --> 01:35:10,058
As we start getting underway
in just a few moments.

1660
01:35:10,267 --> 01:35:11,768
The factory teams doing battle.

1661
01:35:11,977 --> 01:35:16,314
(drowned out by loud droning engines)

1662
01:35:16,523 --> 01:35:17,941
And the starter's flag and we're off.

1663
01:35:18,150 --> 01:35:21,778
(cacophonous engine revving)

1664
01:35:33,832 --> 01:35:36,668
Taking the lead is Cal Grafer, number 25.

1665
01:35:36,877 --> 01:35:40,922
(muffled and distorted
announcement chatter)

1666
01:35:53,143 --> 01:35:55,103
Taking the back is a first,
we've got a duel going

1667
01:35:55,312 --> 01:35:57,563
between two of the unknown
first-time entries here

1668
01:35:57,773 --> 01:36:01,818
as number 10 Halsy Knox
and number 58 Little Fauss.

1669
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:04,862
And they're really
see-sawing it back and forth.

1670
01:36:05,072 --> 01:36:07,532
The number 58, Fauss on the inside there.

1671
01:36:07,741 --> 01:36:10,702
Getting up to about half a bike lane.

1672
01:36:11,787 --> 01:36:13,371
And they're see-sawing it back and forth.

1673
01:36:13,580 --> 01:36:15,415
They are through the turns
and they should come down

1674
01:36:15,624 --> 01:36:17,000
the front straightaway side-to-side.

1675
01:36:17,209 --> 01:36:18,960
We'll find out who's got that horsepower.

1676
01:36:19,169 --> 01:36:21,170
But wait a minute,
approaching turn seven there,

1677
01:36:21,380 --> 01:36:23,339
number 10, Knox starts to stretch it out

1678
01:36:23,549 --> 01:36:25,216
as he pulls by off of nine.

1679
01:36:25,426 --> 01:36:27,677
He's up about one
length, he gets up to two

1680
01:36:27,886 --> 01:36:30,513
and apparently Knox has broken out now

1681
01:36:30,723 --> 01:36:32,223
and starting to move up.

1682
01:36:32,433 --> 01:36:35,184
(loud revving engines)

1683
01:36:35,394 --> 01:36:37,061
There he goes from fifth to fourth.

1684
01:36:37,271 --> 01:36:39,355
And they come down that front
straightaway around that bend

1685
01:36:39,565 --> 01:36:41,274
and he's got the lead.

1686
01:36:43,027 --> 01:36:44,152
(backfiring)

1687
01:36:44,361 --> 01:36:46,821
Number 10 Halsy Knox apparent
coming up with some trouble

1688
01:36:47,031 --> 01:36:49,157
there he's slowing down.

1689
01:36:49,366 --> 01:36:51,701
Once again, back in the
pack, it's number 58.

1690
01:36:51,910 --> 01:36:54,954
A first-timer Little Fauss
starting to put the pressure on

1691
01:36:55,164 --> 01:36:57,665
as he works his way by Rodder and Kazisaki

1692
01:36:57,875 --> 01:36:59,500
and he goes up to eighth.

1693
01:36:59,710 --> 01:37:02,128
Across the straightaway we
come and we've got a brand new

1694
01:37:02,338 --> 01:37:05,548
duel going with Little Fauss,
number 58 from Oklahoma.

1695
01:37:05,758 --> 01:37:07,675
Fauss again and he picks
up another position.

1696
01:37:07,885 --> 01:37:09,010
He's running seventh.

1697
01:37:09,219 --> 01:37:10,553
Up to sixth he goes.

1698
01:37:10,763 --> 01:37:13,681
There he goes past (drowned
out by engines) into fourth.

1699
01:37:13,891 --> 01:37:16,434
As they come down the
straightaway, around the bend

1700
01:37:16,643 --> 01:37:18,811
and he's in third position now
getting ready to take a shot

1701
01:37:19,021 --> 01:37:21,898
at the big boys up front
with only 10 laps to go.

1702
01:37:22,107 --> 01:37:24,567
If Fauss can continue the
pace, we could have an upset

1703
01:37:24,777 --> 01:37:26,652
this afternoon here at Sears Point.

1704
01:37:26,862 --> 01:37:30,406
So keep your eyes on number
58, Little Fauss from Oklahoma.

1705
01:37:30,616 --> 01:37:33,451
With only 10 laps to go, if
Fauss can continue the pace,

1706
01:37:33,660 --> 01:37:36,454
we could have an upset this
afternoon here at Sears Point.

1707
01:37:36,663 --> 01:37:40,708
(overlapping, atmospheric dialogue)

1708
01:37:52,596 --> 01:37:55,181
♫ Little Fauss and Big Halsy

1709
01:37:55,391 --> 01:37:57,475
♫ Man, they make a winnin' team

1710
