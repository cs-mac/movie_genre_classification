1
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,382
<i>Hi. You've reached Grace,</i>

2
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,416
<i>Stanley, Heidi, and Dawn.</i>

3
00:00:26,516 --> 00:00:28,382
<i>We're not home right now,</i>
<i>but if you leave a message,</i>

4
00:00:28,482 --> 00:00:30,227
<i>we'll get back to you</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

5
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:34,613
<i>Hi, everyone! It's Mom!</i>

6
00:00:34,713 --> 00:00:35,913
<i>I just wanted to call</i>

7
00:00:36,013 --> 00:00:38,416
<i>and tell you how much</i>
<i>I'm thinking of you.</i>

8
00:00:38,516 --> 00:00:41,214
<i>Stan, I guess</i>
<i>you're at work now.</i>

9
00:00:41,314 --> 00:00:44,013
<i>Have you had a chance</i>
<i>to go to that group thing yet?</i>

10
00:00:44,113 --> 00:00:47,448
<i>I think it's a great idea.</i>

11
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:50,680
<i>God, it's hot here.</i>

12
00:00:50,779 --> 00:00:53,278
<i>I'm not sure when I'm going</i>
<i>to be able to call again.</i>

13
00:00:53,378 --> 00:00:55,815
<i>It might be a few days.</i>

14
00:00:55,915 --> 00:00:58,282
<i>I just wanted to tell you</i>
<i>that I love you</i>

15
00:00:58,382 --> 00:00:59,730
<i>and I miss you.</i>

16
00:01:01,466 --> 00:01:02,954
<i>Write me.</i>

17
00:01:07,832 --> 00:01:08,945
Good morning.

18
00:01:09,045 --> 00:01:09,949
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

19
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:11,021
Let's huddle up.

20
00:01:16,133 --> 00:01:17,779
Put it in.

21
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,445
Come on, Agnes.

22
00:01:19,545 --> 00:01:20,713
All right, now give me an H!

23
00:01:20,812 --> 00:01:21,716
- H!
- Give me an O!

24
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:22,716
- O!
- Give me an M!

25
00:01:22,815 --> 00:01:23,716
- M!
- Give me an E!

26
00:01:23,815 --> 00:01:24,912
- E!
- Give me an S!

27
00:01:25,012 --> 00:01:26,045
- S!
- Give me a T!

28
00:01:26,145 --> 00:01:27,246
- T!
- Give me an O-R-E!

29
00:01:27,346 --> 00:01:28,249
O-R-E!

30
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:29,249
What's that spell?

31
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:30,249
Home Store!

32
00:01:30,349 --> 00:01:31,412
- What's that spell?
- Home Store!

33
00:01:31,512 --> 00:01:32,882
- Who's number 1?
- Customers!

34
00:01:32,982 --> 00:01:34,315
- Who's number 1?
- Customers!

35
00:01:34,415 --> 00:01:36,248
- Who's number 1?
- Customers!

36
00:01:36,348 --> 00:01:38,299
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

37
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,525
Go get 'em.

38
00:01:53,633 --> 00:01:55,414
And Charles knows that I don't...

39
00:01:55,514 --> 00:01:58,882
I don't usually go
for that kind of thing.

40
00:01:58,982 --> 00:02:00,647
But he's telling me

41
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:04,879
how hot I'm making him,

42
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:08,512
and, uh, I can...
I can even hear him.

43
00:02:08,612 --> 00:02:11,213
He's... I can hear him.

44
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:13,882
You know, so we both...

45
00:02:13,982 --> 00:02:16,882
we're... we're both getting into it,

46
00:02:16,982 --> 00:02:18,248
getting really...

47
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:20,311
muttering and talking,

48
00:02:20,411 --> 00:02:21,978
and I'm just about to scream,

49
00:02:22,078 --> 00:02:25,746
and... and... and...
and then the phone goes dead.

50
00:02:26,899 --> 00:02:28,614
It's pretty romantic, huh?

51
00:02:28,713 --> 00:02:30,313
Oh, honey, don't worry.

52
00:02:30,413 --> 00:02:32,350
Those won't be his last words.

53
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,316
You should consider yourself lucky.

54
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:35,377
Phone sex is nothing

55
00:02:35,477 --> 00:02:36,915
compared to what Ron did to me

56
00:02:37,015 --> 00:02:38,078
the night before he shipped.

57
00:02:38,178 --> 00:02:39,880
I know, but it would
never be like that

58
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,882
with a woman.

59
00:02:40,982 --> 00:02:42,713
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

60
00:02:42,813 --> 00:02:46,047
Well, you know, I've never had
to make that kind of good-bye.

61
00:02:46,147 --> 00:02:47,914
Well, why don't we ask Stanley?

62
00:02:48,014 --> 00:02:49,726
His wife did.

63
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:57,194
Uh, well, Stan?

64
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,266
Grace and I had a nice time.

65
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:05,711
Well, what did you do?

66
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,425
We put the kids to bed, you know.

67
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,148
Then we watched Leno.

68
00:03:12,248 --> 00:03:13,392
You didn't...

69
00:03:15,433 --> 00:03:18,680
That's really none
of anybody's business.

70
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,716
I'm sorry. It's...

71
00:03:20,816 --> 00:03:23,345
Uh, I mean, it must
have been so hard.

72
00:03:23,445 --> 00:03:24,978
No, no, no.
It wasn't hard.

73
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,658
I was proud to see her go.

74
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:38,880
Of course you were.

75
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,382
Mm-hmm.

76
00:03:40,482 --> 00:03:42,478
- Of course you were.
- Yeah.

77
00:03:42,578 --> 00:03:43,678
Yeah, we're all proud.

78
00:03:43,778 --> 00:03:46,379
I just want them to come home.

79
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,478
When is Ron supposed
to come home?

80
00:03:48,577 --> 00:03:50,415
January if his tour
doesn't get extended.

81
00:03:50,515 --> 00:03:51,713
Well, don't hold your breath.

82
00:03:51,813 --> 00:03:53,216
They always extend.

83
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,682
Welcome to the Army, honey,

84
00:03:54,782 --> 00:03:56,548
and my prescription medicine cabinet.

85
00:03:56,647 --> 00:03:58,481
<i>Two bombs have gone off</i>

86
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,577
<i>in the capital today,</i>

87
00:03:59,677 --> 00:04:00,846
<i>killing at least four people,</i>

88
00:04:00,946 --> 00:04:02,382
<i>and there have also been reports</i>

89
00:04:02,482 --> 00:04:03,814
<i>of skirmishes between gunmen...</i>

90
00:04:13,832 --> 00:04:15,378
What was that?

91
00:04:15,478 --> 00:04:16,988
Nothing.

92
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,956
What were you watching?

93
00:04:22,466 --> 00:04:23,645
Nothing.

94
00:04:23,745 --> 00:04:26,028
Turn it back on.

95
00:04:29,565 --> 00:04:31,293
W-What?

96
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:39,646
<i>Not everyone is pleased</i>

97
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,182
<i>with the new order of things in Baghdad.</i>

98
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:43,446
<i>Thousands today demonstrated in front...</i>

99
00:04:43,545 --> 00:04:44,982
I'm sorry, Dad.

100
00:04:45,082 --> 00:04:46,314
You better be.

101
00:04:46,414 --> 00:04:47,445
<i>...the demonstration organized</i>

102
00:04:47,544 --> 00:04:49,544
<i>by anti-occupation Shiites.</i>

00:04:49,644 --> 00:04:52,380
<i>In a disturbing development</i>

00:04:54,745 --> 00:04:56,198
<i>...raising new security concerns...</i>

106
00:05:08,632 --> 00:05:11,155
What's this I hear about you
falling asleep in school?

107
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:15,845
You know better than that.

108
00:05:15,945 --> 00:05:17,011
I'm sorry.

109
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:18,515
We get plenty of sleep
here every night.

110
00:05:18,615 --> 00:05:20,745
There's no excuse for you
to be falling asleep in school.

111
00:05:20,845 --> 00:05:22,344
I know.

112
00:05:22,444 --> 00:05:23,714
I'm not going to have
to talk to you

113
00:05:23,814 --> 00:05:25,662
about this again, am I?

114
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:29,646
I didn't hear you.

115
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,149
No.

116
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:32,892
Good.

117
00:05:34,565 --> 00:05:35,982
I want you to go
to Mrs. Shimerhorn tomorrow.

118
00:05:36,082 --> 00:05:37,348
I want you to apologize,

119
00:05:37,448 --> 00:05:39,316
I want you to ask for extra work
to show for your disrespect.

120
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,147
- But, Dad...
- No buts.

121
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:44,278
Dad, she's going to have
her baby any day.

122
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:45,445
Mm-hmm.

123
00:05:45,544 --> 00:05:47,544
And she's really grouchy right now.

124
00:05:47,644 --> 00:05:49,414
Then you'd better ask her really nice.

125
00:05:49,513 --> 00:05:51,658
Dad, I... I can't just go up to her...

126
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:54,477
...and ask her
for more work when l...

127
00:05:54,577 --> 00:05:55,588
Shh!

128
00:06:12,766 --> 00:06:13,891
Thank you.

129
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:20,960
There we go.
Good night.

130
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:27,056
All right now.

131
00:06:28,366 --> 00:06:29,661
I love you.

132
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,925
Stanley Phillips?

133
00:07:16,432 --> 00:07:18,421
Is your wife Grace Ann Phillips?

134
00:07:22,932 --> 00:07:25,693
May we come inside, sir?

135
00:07:29,832 --> 00:07:31,546
No.

136
00:07:31,646 --> 00:07:33,564
Whatever you're gonna say, just say.

137
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,846
Mr. Phillips,
I regret to inform you,

138
00:07:39,946 --> 00:07:43,113
on behalf of
the President of the United States,

139
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,710
that Sergeant Grace Ann Phillips

140
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:50,061
was killed at 2100 hours
on March 12.

141
00:07:55,632 --> 00:07:57,621
I was in the shower.

142
00:08:01,432 --> 00:08:04,058
Mr. Phillips,
may we come inside, sir?

143
00:08:28,332 --> 00:08:31,457
Mr. Phillips,
this is Chaplain Johnson.

144
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,345
He lives on base,

145
00:08:34,445 --> 00:08:36,214
and he'll be available to you

146
00:08:36,313 --> 00:08:38,731
and your children at any time.

147
00:08:40,532 --> 00:08:42,896
Would you like to pray
with me, Mr. Phillips?

148
00:08:44,465 --> 00:08:45,658
No.

149
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:50,083
Mr. Phillips, I'm going to need you

150
00:08:50,183 --> 00:08:51,825
to sign this, please, sir.

151
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:54,645
It's just a form

152
00:08:54,745 --> 00:08:56,149
stating you'll be at this address

153
00:08:56,249 --> 00:08:58,199
for the next 45 days.

154
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:16,949
Is there somebody
you'd like to call

155
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:19,915
while we wait here
with you, sir?

156
00:09:20,015 --> 00:09:21,915
No. Don't wait.

157
00:09:22,015 --> 00:09:23,078
Don't wait.

158
00:09:23,178 --> 00:09:24,688
Are you sure?

159
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:36,048
Captain Douglas Tamlin will be
your casualty assistant officer.

160
00:09:36,148 --> 00:09:38,346
He'll be stopping
by here later today

161
00:09:38,446 --> 00:09:40,978
with more details

162
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:42,847
concerning your wife's death.

163
00:09:42,947 --> 00:09:46,612
Mr. Phillips, any man
who's ever been a soldier

164
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:48,244
shares in your grief.

165
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:51,411
Sergeant Phillips was a brave soldier.

166
00:09:51,511 --> 00:09:55,023
She died serving the country she loved.

167
00:10:29,766 --> 00:10:32,311
<i>Hi. You've reached Grace, Stanley,</i>

168
00:10:32,411 --> 00:10:33,349
<i>Heidi, and Dawn.</i>

169
00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:34,545
<i>We're not home right now,</i>

170
00:10:34,645 --> 00:10:35,981
<i>but if you leave a message,</i>

171
00:10:36,081 --> 00:10:38,157
<i>we'll be back to you</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

172
00:10:39,732 --> 00:10:41,912
<i>Hey, Mr. Phillips. It's Rick.</i>

173
00:10:42,012 --> 00:10:43,612
<i>At the Home Store?</i>

174
00:10:43,712 --> 00:10:46,711
<i>Just wondering if</i>
<i>you're coming in to work today.</i>

175
00:10:46,811 --> 00:10:48,264
<i>Okay. Thanks.</i>

176
00:12:17,732 --> 00:12:19,322
- Race you!
- Oh!

177
00:12:23,832 --> 00:12:25,195
What's this?

178
00:12:39,465 --> 00:12:42,431
Give me that.
Thank you.

179
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,910
Hi, girls.

180
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,381
What are you doing here?

181
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:51,511
Where'd you get that?

182
00:12:51,611 --> 00:12:53,292
Someone left a casserole.

183
00:12:58,932 --> 00:13:00,761
You okay?

184
00:13:06,098 --> 00:13:07,014
Don't eat that.

185
00:13:07,114 --> 00:13:08,928
- Why not?
- Just don't.

186
00:13:10,265 --> 00:13:11,856
Is something wrong?

187
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,714
Don't. Stop.

188
00:13:14,814 --> 00:13:17,458
Stop. Stop, please.

189
00:13:26,032 --> 00:13:27,814
Okay, girls, let's go
in the living room.

190
00:13:27,914 --> 00:13:29,296
I want to talk to you.

191
00:13:37,499 --> 00:13:39,089
Girls.

192
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:43,287
Yeah, Dad?

193
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:53,844
Hey, who's hungry?
Who wants to go get something to eat?

194
00:13:53,944 --> 00:13:55,910
- I do.
- It's only 4:00.

195
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:57,145
So what?

196
00:13:57,245 --> 00:13:58,479
Shotgun!

197
00:13:58,579 --> 00:14:01,076
You can't call shotgun
until you're outside.

198
00:14:01,176 --> 00:14:02,222
Race you.

199
00:14:04,832 --> 00:14:05,748
Dad?

200
00:14:05,848 --> 00:14:07,715
Go. Go, go, go, both of you.

201
00:14:07,815 --> 00:14:08,991
Go, go, go, go, go.

202
00:14:27,932 --> 00:14:29,280
<i># Doot doo-doot #</i>

203
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,343
# Hey, Dad, yeah #

204
00:14:30,443 --> 00:14:31,848
# Hey, Dad, yeah #

205
00:14:31,947 --> 00:14:33,848
# Shake your booty, no way #

206
00:14:33,947 --> 00:14:36,247
# Shake your booty, okay #

207
00:14:36,347 --> 00:14:37,457
# Jump jump #

208
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,014
- You go get a table...
- Okay.

209
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:43,447
...and we'll go to the arcade.

210
00:14:43,547 --> 00:14:44,929
- All right.
- Bye, Dad.

211
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:46,143
Okay, girls, we're going right now.

212
00:15:46,243 --> 00:15:47,412
- Dad...
- Come on.

213
00:15:47,512 --> 00:15:49,544
We just got here.

214
00:15:49,644 --> 00:15:51,143
We were just getting into it.

215
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:53,581
I don't care. Just come on.

216
00:15:53,681 --> 00:15:55,529
Heidi, move.

217
00:15:59,465 --> 00:16:00,747
Where are we going?

218
00:16:00,846 --> 00:16:02,113
Where would you like to go?

219
00:16:02,213 --> 00:16:03,244
I don't know.

220
00:16:03,344 --> 00:16:04,248
How about you, Dawn?

221
00:16:04,348 --> 00:16:06,512
Is there any place
you'd like to go?

222
00:16:06,612 --> 00:16:08,048
Enchanted Gardens.

223
00:16:08,148 --> 00:16:09,711
Don't be a moron, Dawn.

224
00:16:09,811 --> 00:16:11,978
I'm not. Daddy asked
where we wanted to go.

225
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:13,212
That's not what he meant.

226
00:16:13,312 --> 00:16:14,614
You don't know.

227
00:16:14,714 --> 00:16:15,980
Yes, I do.

228
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,712
I don't care. I want to.

229
00:16:17,812 --> 00:16:18,715
Stop it.

230
00:16:18,815 --> 00:16:19,715
Stop it.

231
00:16:19,815 --> 00:16:21,181
- Seriously.
- Seriously.

232
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:22,595
Stop!

233
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,393
Oh, God.

234
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:28,549
Aah! Stop!

235
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:30,097
What if we did?

236
00:16:31,766 --> 00:16:32,682
What?

237
00:16:32,782 --> 00:16:34,181
What if we did right now

238
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:36,128
went to Enchanted Gardens?

239
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:38,912
What if we did?

240
00:16:39,012 --> 00:16:40,010
What?

241
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,014
Go to Enchanted Gardens
right now?

242
00:16:42,114 --> 00:16:43,792
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!

243
00:16:45,398 --> 00:16:46,887
Be quiet, be quiet.

244
00:16:47,178 --> 00:16:48,644
We can't.

245
00:16:48,743 --> 00:16:50,614
Is that's something
you'd like to do? Why not?

246
00:16:50,714 --> 00:16:51,980
- Sit down, Dawn.
- No!

247
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,448
Girls, why not?

248
00:16:53,547 --> 00:16:54,448
Dad... Dad...

249
00:16:54,548 --> 00:16:55,678
We have school.

250
00:16:55,778 --> 00:16:57,546
You can miss
a few days of school.

251
00:16:57,646 --> 00:16:58,548
Yeah, Heidi.

252
00:16:58,648 --> 00:16:59,548
- We can?
- Yeah.

253
00:16:59,648 --> 00:17:01,144
Of course we can. Right, Dad?

254
00:17:01,244 --> 00:17:02,711
- Sure. Why not?
- Yes!

255
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:03,844
What about your job?

256
00:17:03,944 --> 00:17:05,214
Don't worry about my job.

257
00:17:05,313 --> 00:17:06,546
Don't worry about his job.

258
00:17:06,646 --> 00:17:08,144
Dad...

259
00:17:08,244 --> 00:17:10,081
Huh? Well?

260
00:17:10,181 --> 00:17:11,448
What about homework?

261
00:17:11,547 --> 00:17:13,044
Don't worry about your homework.

262
00:17:13,144 --> 00:17:14,312
Don't worry about our homework.

263
00:17:14,411 --> 00:17:16,680
We can do... We can help you
with your homework.

264
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,856
Dawn and I can
help you in the car.

265
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:21,710
Let's do it. Right now.

266
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:22,979
- Are you serious?
- Yeah!

267
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:23,981
Of course he's serious.

268
00:17:24,081 --> 00:17:26,948
Yeah. Why not? Let's go.

269
00:17:27,048 --> 00:17:29,347
You got to get some fun
out of life, Heidi.

270
00:17:29,446 --> 00:17:30,347
You, too, Dawn.

271
00:17:30,447 --> 00:17:31,881
- Let's do it!
- Let's go!

272
00:17:31,981 --> 00:17:34,544
Let's do it! Do you guys
want to do it?

273
00:17:34,644 --> 00:17:35,947
I do!

274
00:17:36,047 --> 00:17:37,746
You party pooper!

275
00:17:37,846 --> 00:17:40,147
Yes or no, Heidi, right now.

276
00:17:40,246 --> 00:17:41,648
This is a one-time-only offer.

277
00:17:41,748 --> 00:17:43,344
Enchanted Gardens right now.

278
00:17:43,444 --> 00:17:45,409
- Right now, Heidi.
- Right now!

279
00:17:45,509 --> 00:17:46,611
Do we have an atlas?

280
00:17:46,711 --> 00:17:47,614
Let's do it!

281
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,015
<i>Hi. You've reached Grace, Stanley,</i>

282
00:19:28,114 --> 00:19:29,110
<i>Heidi, and Dawn.</i>

283
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,480
<i>We're not home right now,</i>

284
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,914
<i>but if you leave a message,</i>

285
00:19:32,013 --> 00:19:34,294
<i>we'll get back to you</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

286
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:38,660
Hey.

287
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:47,443
Just wanted to let you know
the girls and I are... okay.

288
00:19:47,544 --> 00:19:50,915
We just decided to take a little trip.

289
00:19:51,014 --> 00:19:53,157
We're having a really good time.

290
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,580
<i>...could face fines</i>

291
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,548
<i>up to $300 under the new law.</i>

292
00:20:50,648 --> 00:20:52,981
<i>There's a flood watch in</i>
<i>parts of Western Minnesota</i>

293
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,413
<i>through tomorrow evening.</i>

294
00:20:54,513 --> 00:20:57,111
<i>Tonight should be cloudy</i>
<i>with rain showers likely.</i>

295
00:20:57,211 --> 00:20:58,255
<i>Isolated thunders...</i>

296
00:21:07,965 --> 00:21:09,746
Good morning.

297
00:21:09,846 --> 00:21:11,230
Good morning.

298
00:21:24,398 --> 00:21:26,023
Where are we?

299
00:21:27,765 --> 00:21:30,356
I'm not entirely sure.

300
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,282
We should call school

301
00:21:33,381 --> 00:21:35,213
and tell them we're
going to be absent.

302
00:21:35,313 --> 00:21:39,445
Let's think of something
fun to do today.

303
00:21:39,545 --> 00:21:41,191
Can you do that?

304
00:21:42,765 --> 00:21:43,753
What's that?

305
00:21:44,865 --> 00:21:46,911
What's that? What is that?

306
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:49,144
Supposed to be an answer
to my question?

307
00:21:49,244 --> 00:21:51,181
Huh? Huh? No?

308
00:21:51,281 --> 00:21:52,344
No.

309
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:53,544
Well, let's try that again.

310
00:21:53,644 --> 00:21:55,413
Come on. Can we think
of something fun

311
00:21:55,513 --> 00:21:56,828
that we want to do today?

312
00:21:58,398 --> 00:22:00,112
No.

313
00:22:00,212 --> 00:22:02,412
No? Why not?

314
00:22:02,512 --> 00:22:04,948
We've talked about it
too much now.

315
00:22:05,047 --> 00:22:06,043
So?

316
00:22:06,143 --> 00:22:08,946
So now there's
too much pressure.

317
00:22:09,046 --> 00:22:10,429
Too much pressure?

318
00:22:23,298 --> 00:22:24,377
What are you doing?

319
00:22:24,477 --> 00:22:27,212
You cannot just drive into this field.

320
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:29,012
Oh, yes, I can.

321
00:22:29,112 --> 00:22:30,548
Dad, what are you doing?

322
00:22:30,648 --> 00:22:32,928
I'm doing doughnuts.
What's it look like?

323
00:22:34,031 --> 00:22:35,542
We're going to get in trouble.

324
00:22:35,643 --> 00:22:37,244
- No, no, we're not.
- Watch for the birds.

325
00:22:37,344 --> 00:22:39,511
No, the birds fly out of the way.

326
00:22:39,611 --> 00:22:41,312
What the heck are we doing?

327
00:22:41,412 --> 00:22:42,976
Hey! Good morning, Dawn!

328
00:22:43,076 --> 00:22:45,014
Are we on a road?

329
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,014
Nope.

330
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,244
Cool!

331
00:22:47,344 --> 00:22:48,478
Fun, isn't it?

332
00:22:48,578 --> 00:22:49,515
Yeah!

333
00:22:49,615 --> 00:22:51,447
I used to do this all the time

334
00:22:51,547 --> 00:22:52,881
when I was a teenager.

335
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,779
Why?

336
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,012
Why? I don't know.
It's fun, isn't it?

337
00:22:57,111 --> 00:22:58,946
Why would you do this?

338
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:01,520
I don't know. I guess
I just like peeling out.

339
00:23:02,998 --> 00:23:05,246
I didn't put a ton of thought
into everything I did

340
00:23:05,346 --> 00:23:06,977
when I was a kid, Heidi.

341
00:23:07,077 --> 00:23:10,447
All right. Let's go.

342
00:23:10,547 --> 00:23:11,725
Where are we going?

343
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:20,614
- Dad?
- Yeah.

344
00:23:20,714 --> 00:23:23,243
Are we really going
to Enchanted Gardens?

345
00:23:23,343 --> 00:23:24,444
Of course we are. Why?

346
00:23:24,544 --> 00:23:25,881
I just wanted to make sure.

347
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,543
Okay.

348
00:23:27,644 --> 00:23:28,879
- Dad?
- Yeah.

349
00:23:28,978 --> 00:23:30,077
Can we get a monkey?

350
00:23:30,177 --> 00:23:31,081
No.

351
00:23:31,181 --> 00:23:32,278
What if it's really little?

352
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:33,943
Like littler than a puppy.

353
00:23:34,043 --> 00:23:35,812
Still no.

354
00:23:35,912 --> 00:23:37,011
Can we get a pony?

355
00:23:37,111 --> 00:23:38,014
No.

356
00:23:38,114 --> 00:23:39,014
An iPod?

357
00:23:39,114 --> 00:23:40,447
No.

358
00:23:40,547 --> 00:23:42,010
- Dad?
- Yes, Dawn.

359
00:23:42,109 --> 00:23:44,014
Can we get our ears pierced?

360
00:23:44,114 --> 00:23:47,143
No. Not till you're 13.
You know the rules.

361
00:23:47,243 --> 00:23:48,147
Dad?

362
00:23:48,247 --> 00:23:49,147
Be quiet, Dawn.

363
00:23:49,247 --> 00:23:50,243
What? Do I hear something?

364
00:23:50,343 --> 00:23:51,343
- Dawn!
- I don't hear anything...

365
00:23:51,443 --> 00:23:52,347
Dawn!

366
00:23:52,447 --> 00:23:53,848
...at all, no, no.

367
00:23:53,947 --> 00:23:54,847
Be quiet!

368
00:23:54,947 --> 00:23:56,044
Girls, come on.
Straighten up.

369
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:57,480
I got a surprise for you.

370
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,644
What is it?

371
00:23:58,744 --> 00:24:00,391
We're going to stop
and see Grandma.

372
00:24:12,398 --> 00:24:15,125
I can get in around back.
Just wait here.

373
00:24:38,365 --> 00:24:39,422
<i>My lamp.</i>

374
00:24:44,598 --> 00:24:47,143
<i>So you want to marry</i>
<i>my daughter.</i>

375
00:24:47,243 --> 00:24:48,697
<i>I sure do. Boy!</i>

376
00:24:58,398 --> 00:24:59,314
Hey.

377
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:01,714
Hey, Uncle John.

378
00:25:01,813 --> 00:25:04,579
What are you guys doing here?

379
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,243
Oh, hey, don't...
don't get too close.

380
00:25:06,343 --> 00:25:07,853
I think I have bad breath.

381
00:25:13,465 --> 00:25:17,898
<i>New lamps for all!</i>

382
00:25:23,298 --> 00:25:24,923
Is your dad here?

383
00:25:31,898 --> 00:25:33,420
Can I help you?

384
00:25:36,732 --> 00:25:38,412
John, what are you doing here?

385
00:25:38,512 --> 00:25:40,043
What are you doing here?

386
00:25:40,143 --> 00:25:41,912
Trying to find a way in.

387
00:25:42,012 --> 00:25:44,712
What, the front door
too obvious for you?

388
00:25:44,812 --> 00:25:46,559
Open the door, man.

389
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:50,381
Hey, bro.

390
00:25:50,481 --> 00:25:51,381
How are you, man?

391
00:25:51,481 --> 00:25:52,848
I'm good, man.

392
00:25:52,947 --> 00:25:54,409
How you doing?

393
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:55,964
Come on in.

394
00:25:58,231 --> 00:26:00,614
So what have you
been up to, John?

395
00:26:00,714 --> 00:26:03,913
I'm studying to take the GRE.

396
00:26:04,012 --> 00:26:05,948
Good. You going back to school?

397
00:26:06,048 --> 00:26:07,346
I'm thinking about it, yeah.

398
00:26:07,446 --> 00:26:09,010
That's great. What for?

399
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:12,447
Law. Or medicine.
I haven't decided yet.

400
00:26:12,547 --> 00:26:13,691
Oh.

401
00:26:15,231 --> 00:26:16,209
That's great.

402
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:18,580
What's new with you?

403
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,392
Not much.

404
00:26:23,131 --> 00:26:24,379
You all right?

405
00:26:24,479 --> 00:26:27,347
What do you mean, am I...
I... I'm fine.

406
00:26:27,447 --> 00:26:29,713
You're not upset?

407
00:26:29,812 --> 00:26:31,612
About what?

408
00:26:31,712 --> 00:26:35,013
Uh, I don't know.
I mean, where do I start?

409
00:26:35,113 --> 00:26:37,610
The situation's such a mess.

410
00:26:37,709 --> 00:26:39,310
The situation? What situation?

411
00:26:39,411 --> 00:26:40,848
What situation?

412
00:26:40,947 --> 00:26:43,246
I mean, it sounds like
a fucking mess over there.

413
00:26:43,346 --> 00:26:44,944
Watch your language.

414
00:26:45,044 --> 00:26:46,258
Sorry. Sorry.

415
00:26:53,265 --> 00:26:55,424
You don't know what
you're talking about anyway.

416
00:26:56,398 --> 00:26:58,044
Who does?
The administration?

417
00:26:58,144 --> 00:27:00,676
I mean, they'll tell you
the sun comes out at midnight

418
00:27:00,776 --> 00:27:02,742
if it serves their cause.

419
00:27:02,842 --> 00:27:05,729
And how about that monkey boy
president of yours?

420
00:27:07,731 --> 00:27:09,114
He's your president, too.

421
00:27:09,214 --> 00:27:10,311
I didn't vote for him.

422
00:27:10,411 --> 00:27:11,887
You didn't vote at all, did you?

423
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:14,314
That's... That's not the point.

424
00:27:14,414 --> 00:27:16,876
Isn't it?

425
00:27:16,975 --> 00:27:19,010
Just...

426
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,244
stop talking.

427
00:27:20,344 --> 00:27:21,647
Let's not have that
conversation right now.

428
00:27:21,746 --> 00:27:23,114
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

429
00:27:23,214 --> 00:27:24,614
That's what your side's
all about, isn't it?

430
00:27:24,713 --> 00:27:25,613
Censoring dissent?

431
00:27:25,713 --> 00:27:27,377
Stop.

432
00:27:27,478 --> 00:27:29,145
Why? I mean, we're just talking.

433
00:27:29,245 --> 00:27:30,344
Are you afraid of talking?

434
00:27:30,444 --> 00:27:32,280
No, I'm not afraid of that at all.

435
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,213
I just don't want to confuse the girls.
Is that all right?

436
00:27:34,313 --> 00:27:35,876
I'm sure they're already confused.

437
00:27:35,976 --> 00:27:38,010
I mean...

438
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,711
really, what do you
think about all this?

439
00:27:40,811 --> 00:27:43,662
Do you have an opinion?

440
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,642
They think their mom's a hero,

441
00:27:47,742 --> 00:27:49,810
and they think it's easy
to criticize the situation

442
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,746
when you're sitting
in your mom's living room

443
00:27:51,846 --> 00:27:54,079
thinking about
going back to school...

444
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:55,946
maybe law, maybe med...
I don't know.

445
00:27:56,046 --> 00:27:58,576
They think every one
of those privileged opinions

446
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,912
is a freedom that their mother
fights for daily

447
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,414
on your behalf.

448
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,225
That's what they think.

449
00:28:06,664 --> 00:28:08,277
Well, it's... it's good to see

450
00:28:08,378 --> 00:28:10,558
that you let them
think for themselves.

451
00:28:15,298 --> 00:28:17,161
You girls hungry?

452
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:22,194
You think your dad
will buy us lunch?

453
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:27,944
It's 4:30, man.

454
00:28:28,044 --> 00:28:30,088
You think your dad
will buy us dinner?

455
00:28:33,031 --> 00:28:35,279
Want to buy Uncle John dinner?

456
00:28:35,379 --> 00:28:36,714
You don't want to come?

457
00:28:36,813 --> 00:28:40,546
No, I think I'm just
going to stay here and...

458
00:28:40,646 --> 00:28:42,597
take a little cat nap.

459
00:28:46,731 --> 00:28:48,445
You're bigger than
the last time I saw you.

460
00:28:48,546 --> 00:28:49,509
How old are you now?

461
00:28:49,608 --> 00:28:52,243
Dawn's 8. I'm 12 1/2.

462
00:28:52,344 --> 00:28:53,545
Wow.

463
00:28:53,644 --> 00:28:55,277
How old are you?

464
00:28:55,378 --> 00:28:57,410
32.

465
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:00,476
Bet that sounds
pretty old to you, doesn't it?

466
00:29:00,575 --> 00:29:02,711
Do you have a job?

467
00:29:02,811 --> 00:29:04,748
Why? Are you hiring?

468
00:29:04,848 --> 00:29:06,763
No.

469
00:29:11,198 --> 00:29:13,148
Hey, how come you kids
are out of school?

470
00:29:13,248 --> 00:29:15,810
Dad's taking us
to Enchanted Gardens.

471
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,814
- Why?
- For fun.

472
00:29:17,914 --> 00:29:19,348
You think that place is fun?

473
00:29:19,448 --> 00:29:20,679
What do you mean?

474
00:29:20,778 --> 00:29:22,696
Nothing.

475
00:29:24,265 --> 00:29:25,277
Uncle John?

476
00:29:25,377 --> 00:29:26,524
Yeah.

477
00:29:27,898 --> 00:29:29,746
Why did Dad quit the Army?

478
00:29:29,846 --> 00:29:32,045
He didn't quit.

479
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,143
What do you mean?

480
00:29:34,243 --> 00:29:36,080
He had to leave
because of his eyes.

481
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,743
The Army's strict
about crap like that.

482
00:29:37,843 --> 00:29:40,247
But weren't his eyes always bad?

483
00:29:40,347 --> 00:29:42,546
Mm, more or less.

484
00:29:42,645 --> 00:29:43,744
Well, if they're so strict,

485
00:29:43,844 --> 00:29:46,263
how'd he get in the first place?

486
00:29:49,064 --> 00:29:50,723
He didn't tell you?

487
00:29:53,831 --> 00:29:57,012
Oh, Christ.

488
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:00,247
Well, if he didn't tell you,

489
00:30:00,347 --> 00:30:02,160
he probably wouldn't
want me to, so...

490
00:30:07,465 --> 00:30:10,056
All right, you promise not
to tell your dad if I tell you?

491
00:30:14,864 --> 00:30:16,523
He cheated.

492
00:30:22,831 --> 00:30:23,747
How?

493
00:30:23,847 --> 00:30:26,180
He had a buddy take a picture

494
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,843
of the physical examiner's eye chart.

495
00:30:27,943 --> 00:30:29,044
Memorized the letters.

496
00:30:29,144 --> 00:30:31,210
What?

497
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:34,743
Your dad wanted
to serve so bad.

498
00:30:34,842 --> 00:30:37,545
I mean, he really bought

499
00:30:37,645 --> 00:30:41,393
all that patriotic "I Want You" crap.

500
00:30:44,531 --> 00:30:46,543
Which was a good thing, too,

501
00:30:46,643 --> 00:30:51,076
because he never would have
met your mother otherwise.

502
00:30:51,176 --> 00:30:54,777
Well, how'd the Army
find out about his eyes?

503
00:30:54,877 --> 00:30:58,510
Eventually they just gave him
a test he couldn't cheat on,

504
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:01,188
and that was that.

505
00:31:02,464 --> 00:31:04,157
End of the dream.

506
00:32:01,397 --> 00:32:04,645
Why don't you and Dad
like each other?

507
00:32:04,745 --> 00:32:06,822
Did your dad tell you that?

508
00:32:09,798 --> 00:32:11,730
Well, we're just...
we're just different.

509
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:14,447
We have different opinions.

510
00:32:14,546 --> 00:32:16,109
Doesn't mean we don't
like each other.

511
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:19,358
I mean, do you agree
with him about everything?

512
00:32:22,464 --> 00:32:24,577
You shouldn't.

513
00:32:24,677 --> 00:32:25,912
Why not?

514
00:32:26,012 --> 00:32:27,880
Because it's important

515
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,010
that people have their own views

516
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:33,413
based on an understanding of facts.

517
00:32:34,777 --> 00:32:36,776
But it's also important
not to trust the facts

518
00:32:36,876 --> 00:32:38,146
because most of them are lies.

519
00:32:38,246 --> 00:32:40,580
I don't understand.

520
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:45,710
Well, it basically comes down to a...

521
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,012
gut thing.

522
00:32:47,112 --> 00:32:50,913
You just have to be
open to allowing

523
00:32:51,013 --> 00:32:55,111
for a truth which differs
from your own opinions,

524
00:32:55,211 --> 00:32:58,891
or else you'll never actually
see the truth at all.

525
00:33:08,964 --> 00:33:09,976
What's that about?

526
00:33:10,076 --> 00:33:13,042
It's her time of day.

527
00:33:13,142 --> 00:33:16,291
What, it's... it's her time of day?

528
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,808
Mom and Dawn
both set their watches

529
00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:24,645
at the same time every day.

530
00:33:24,745 --> 00:33:25,877
That way, they know

531
00:33:25,977 --> 00:33:27,543
that they're both
thinking of each other

532
00:33:27,643 --> 00:33:28,824
at the same moment.

533
00:33:46,931 --> 00:33:47,847
Girls?

534
00:33:47,947 --> 00:33:48,909
Yeah?

535
00:33:49,009 --> 00:33:49,986
Yeah?

536
00:33:53,697 --> 00:33:54,924
Do you...

537
00:33:56,631 --> 00:33:57,744
want to play tag?

538
00:33:57,844 --> 00:33:59,944
Sure.

539
00:34:00,044 --> 00:34:02,380
That's good because...

540
00:34:02,479 --> 00:34:03,712
you know why?

541
00:34:03,812 --> 00:34:04,855
Why?

542
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:09,376
Because, uh, you're it.

543
00:34:09,476 --> 00:34:10,380
You're it.

544
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,476
Woo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

545
00:34:11,576 --> 00:34:13,177
You're it. Time out.

546
00:34:13,277 --> 00:34:14,613
What do you mean time out?

547
00:34:14,713 --> 00:34:17,176
You can't call time out.

548
00:34:17,275 --> 00:34:20,011
That is so lame.
You can't just...

549
00:34:20,112 --> 00:34:21,493
All right. I'm just going
to read the paper...

550
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:22,412
and find out what's going...

551
00:34:22,512 --> 00:34:23,793
Time in.

552
00:34:30,764 --> 00:34:32,309
You know, I mean,
it's so typical.

553
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:34,942
I'm the victim of this kind
of thing every single day,

554
00:34:35,043 --> 00:34:36,110
and you know why?

555
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,648
It's because
I'm an honest guy,

556
00:34:37,747 --> 00:34:39,309
and I have to pay for it.

557
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:40,454
Mm-hmm.

558
00:34:51,564 --> 00:34:52,757
- Ha!
- Aah!

559
00:35:00,964 --> 00:35:02,589
Hey, the phone's ringing.
Open up.

560
00:35:12,397 --> 00:35:14,245
Hello.

561
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:16,612
Yeah, this is John.

562
00:35:16,712 --> 00:35:18,686
Oh, hey, Mary.

563
00:35:40,364 --> 00:35:42,330
What the hell
are you doing, man?

564
00:35:44,497 --> 00:35:45,846
What's wrong?
Where are the girls?

565
00:35:45,946 --> 00:35:47,397
The girls are fine.

566
00:35:51,164 --> 00:35:52,513
Stan, I just talked to Mary.

567
00:35:52,613 --> 00:35:53,824
I know what's going on.

568
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,344
Do the girls know?

569
00:36:09,444 --> 00:36:11,191
No.

570
00:36:14,597 --> 00:36:16,047
That's good.
Don't tell them yet.

571
00:36:16,146 --> 00:36:18,479
We got to go.
We got to go.

572
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:19,711
We got to go.

573
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:21,612
Stan, what are you doing to them?

574
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:23,322
I'm taking them on a trip.

575
00:36:24,998 --> 00:36:26,178
Just stay out of it.

576
00:36:26,277 --> 00:36:27,410
Stay out of it?

577
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,244
You're the one
who brought me into it.

578
00:36:29,344 --> 00:36:30,443
I didn't bring you into anything.

579
00:36:30,543 --> 00:36:31,846
You were just here. I didn't plan that.

580
00:36:31,946 --> 00:36:33,409
Do you really think

581
00:36:33,508 --> 00:36:35,947
that... that... that taking
them to an amusement park

582
00:36:36,047 --> 00:36:38,346
is going to help them get
over losing their mother?

583
00:36:38,445 --> 00:36:40,577
- Just stay out of it.
- You're going to screw those girls up.

584
00:36:40,677 --> 00:36:41,811
Is that what you want to do?

585
00:36:41,911 --> 00:36:43,314
- Get out of my way.
- They'll never forgive you.

586
00:36:43,413 --> 00:36:45,111
Get out of my way!

587
00:36:45,211 --> 00:36:48,788
Nobody asked you!
Do you understand?

588
00:37:06,631 --> 00:37:08,946
I got to go.

589
00:37:09,046 --> 00:37:10,609
Don't you want to wait for Mom?

590
00:37:10,709 --> 00:37:11,743
No.

591
00:37:11,843 --> 00:37:13,545
We're on a schedule.

592
00:37:13,645 --> 00:37:15,209
Stan...

593
00:37:15,309 --> 00:37:18,044
please stay and wait for Mom

594
00:37:18,144 --> 00:37:21,209
because we can talk
it all out together.

595
00:37:21,309 --> 00:37:22,695
No.

596
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:26,876
It was nice seeing you
again, John.

597
00:37:26,977 --> 00:37:29,246
I got to go. Okay?

598
00:37:29,345 --> 00:37:32,179
Girls!

599
00:37:32,279 --> 00:37:34,059
Girls, get your stuff together!

600
00:37:37,898 --> 00:37:39,488
Girls!

601
00:37:42,264 --> 00:37:43,680
Come on. Get up.

602
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,843
Okay. Come on.
Get up. We got to go.

603
00:37:45,943 --> 00:37:46,847
- Why?
- What?

604
00:37:46,947 --> 00:37:48,246
- We got to go right now.
- Why?

605
00:37:48,345 --> 00:37:49,477
I thought we were going
to see Grandma.

606
00:37:49,577 --> 00:37:51,142
We're going
to talk to her later.

607
00:37:51,242 --> 00:37:53,196
- Get in the goddamn car.
- Dad.

608
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:55,779
What about Uncle John?

609
00:37:55,879 --> 00:37:57,314
What about Uncle John?

610
00:37:57,413 --> 00:37:59,727
We didn't get to say good-bye.

611
00:38:01,731 --> 00:38:03,220
You'll see him again.

612
00:38:19,197 --> 00:38:21,843
I'm bored. Let's drive into a field.

613
00:38:21,944 --> 00:38:24,044
No, Dawn. We already did that.

614
00:38:24,143 --> 00:38:25,046
Why not?

615
00:38:25,146 --> 00:38:26,243
Because we already did it.

616
00:38:26,343 --> 00:38:27,280
So?

617
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,909
So we ought to do something else.

618
00:38:29,009 --> 00:38:31,211
Seems like we've been driving forever.

619
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:33,922
Well, it's going to be forever
with that attitude, isn't it?

620
00:38:35,664 --> 00:38:38,378
You're kind of quiet back there, Heidi.

621
00:38:38,478 --> 00:38:40,178
What are you doing?

622
00:38:40,278 --> 00:38:43,709
Just working on my report.

623
00:38:43,809 --> 00:38:45,748
What's your report about?

624
00:38:45,848 --> 00:38:47,646
Mom.

625
00:38:47,746 --> 00:38:49,979
Whose idea was that?

626
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:51,277
Mrs. Shimerhorn's.

627
00:38:51,377 --> 00:38:53,376
Mrs. Shimerhorn's.

628
00:38:53,476 --> 00:38:55,847
Why does she think
that's a good idea?

629
00:38:55,947 --> 00:38:57,976
Because she thought
it would help or something.

630
00:38:58,075 --> 00:39:00,311
Help with what?
What do you need help with?

631
00:39:00,411 --> 00:39:02,909
I don't know. You know how
people get when Mom goes away.

632
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:05,293
No. How do they get?

633
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:10,389
Like serious.

634
00:39:25,464 --> 00:39:26,380
I call bed!

635
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,380
I call bed.

636
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,930
Not if I get there first!

637
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,018
Oh!

638
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:38,594
Dad, this is so fun.
You want to try?

639
00:39:39,731 --> 00:39:41,080
I'm going to go get a cot.

640
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:43,187
Okely-dokely, artichokey.

641
00:39:48,531 --> 00:39:50,278
I have to poop.

642
00:39:50,378 --> 00:39:52,762
You don't have to tell me
things like that.

643
00:39:56,631 --> 00:40:00,029
There's free shampoo
and a sewing kit!

644
00:40:01,297 --> 00:40:03,112
Hey, what are bath salts?

645
00:40:03,212 --> 00:40:04,175
<i>Noble Elementary.</i>

646
00:40:04,275 --> 00:40:05,343
Mrs. Fissel?

647
00:40:05,443 --> 00:40:06,346
<i>Yes.</i>

648
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:08,009
Hi. This is Heidi Phillips.

649
00:40:08,109 --> 00:40:09,446
I was calling to tell you

650
00:40:09,546 --> 00:40:11,846
that my sister and I
are going to be missing

651
00:40:11,945 --> 00:40:13,508
a couple of school days this week.

652
00:40:13,609 --> 00:40:15,879
<i>Oh, that's okay, Heidi.</i>

653
00:40:15,978 --> 00:40:18,076
We're not sick or anything.

654
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:20,675
We're just taking a trip.

655
00:40:20,776 --> 00:40:21,911
For fun?

656
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:24,177
<i>Oh, Heidi, I understand.</i>

657
00:40:24,277 --> 00:40:27,276
I was wondering if you
could have our teachers

658
00:40:27,376 --> 00:40:28,477
e-mail our dad our homework.

659
00:40:28,577 --> 00:40:30,142
<i>Of course, sweetheart.</i>

660
00:40:30,242 --> 00:40:32,242
Is Mrs. Shimerhorn there?

661
00:40:32,342 --> 00:40:34,145
<i>Mrs. Shimerhorn is in the hospital.</i>

662
00:40:34,245 --> 00:40:35,309
Why?

663
00:40:35,409 --> 00:40:37,178
<i>She's actually having her baby.</i>

664
00:40:37,278 --> 00:40:38,647
Oh, she is?

665
00:40:38,747 --> 00:40:41,046
<i>Yeah, and Miss Abrams</i>
<i>will be taking over for her</i>

666
00:40:41,145 --> 00:40:42,479
<i>for the rest of the year.</i>

667
00:40:42,579 --> 00:40:44,643
Oh. Can you ask her
if it's all right

668
00:40:44,743 --> 00:40:46,613
if my report is late?

669
00:40:46,713 --> 00:40:49,046
Mrs. Shimerhorn said
it had to be done by Monday.

670
00:40:49,145 --> 00:40:51,046
<i>I'm sure it's fine, Heidi, okay?</i>

671
00:40:51,146 --> 00:40:52,243
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

672
00:40:52,343 --> 00:40:53,246
Okay.

673
00:40:53,346 --> 00:40:54,246
<i>Bye, sweetheart.</i>

674
00:40:54,346 --> 00:40:55,318
Bye.

675
00:40:57,164 --> 00:40:58,911
Who was that?

676
00:40:59,011 --> 00:41:00,475
Mrs. Fissel.

677
00:41:00,575 --> 00:41:03,210
What did you call her for?

678
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:05,180
I was trying
to get our homework.

679
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,776
Heidi!

680
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:08,692
She was really nice.

681
00:41:11,097 --> 00:41:12,480
That's cool.

682
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,514
Bang-bang!
Choo-choo train!

683
00:41:14,614 --> 00:41:16,047
Come on, Heidi, do your thing!

684
00:41:16,146 --> 00:41:17,221
Say woo!

685
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,528
What?

686
00:41:27,798 --> 00:41:29,025
Got you.

687
00:41:33,397 --> 00:41:34,624
Marco.

688
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:36,547
Polo!

689
00:41:36,647 --> 00:41:37,547
Marco.

690
00:41:37,647 --> 00:41:38,547
Polo.

691
00:41:38,647 --> 00:41:39,878
- Marco.
- Polo.

692
00:41:39,977 --> 00:41:41,346
- Marco.
- Polo.

693
00:41:41,446 --> 00:41:43,245
Count how long
I can do it.

694
00:41:43,345 --> 00:41:44,318
Okay.

695
00:41:48,963 --> 00:41:50,259
Yeah.

696
00:41:52,297 --> 00:41:54,058
Dad, watch this.

697
00:41:56,164 --> 00:41:57,686
That's good.

698
00:42:02,264 --> 00:42:04,146
This is a long time.

699
00:42:04,246 --> 00:42:06,219
It's like five days.

700
00:42:12,097 --> 00:42:13,028
That was good.

701
00:42:14,997 --> 00:42:16,845
- That was about, like,
- How long?

702
00:42:16,945 --> 00:42:18,313
I don't know, two minutes?

703
00:42:18,413 --> 00:42:19,375
Ha!

704
00:42:19,475 --> 00:42:20,543
You weren't counting.

705
00:42:20,643 --> 00:42:22,063
I was close.

706
00:42:41,597 --> 00:42:42,824
Dad?

707
00:42:44,063 --> 00:42:45,188
Yeah.

708
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:49,580
What's going on?

709
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,220
What do you mean?

710
00:42:53,097 --> 00:42:56,120
Why are we doing all this?

711
00:42:57,497 --> 00:43:00,244
I just wanted to give you girls
a surprise, you know?

712
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:01,523
Take you on a trip.

713
00:43:02,863 --> 00:43:05,488
You didn't go to work
yesterday, did you?

714
00:43:08,063 --> 00:43:10,086
No, I didn't go to work.

715
00:43:12,963 --> 00:43:14,429
Were you fired?

716
00:43:19,364 --> 00:43:20,780
You know Mom's
going to be really mad

717
00:43:20,879 --> 00:43:23,341
if you lose your job, right?

718
00:43:23,441 --> 00:43:25,726
I didn't lose my job, Heidi.

719
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:28,541
Okay?

720
00:43:28,642 --> 00:43:32,379
But if you were going to,
you'd tell us, right?

721
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,930
Yeah, I would tell you.

722
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:48,225
I'm going to go to sleep.

723
00:45:04,164 --> 00:45:05,686
What are you doing?

724
00:45:06,897 --> 00:45:08,475
Nothing.

725
00:45:08,576 --> 00:45:10,643
You're not old enough to smoke.

726
00:45:10,742 --> 00:45:11,944
I'm 18.

727
00:45:12,044 --> 00:45:14,845
No, you're not.

728
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:17,245
Want to bet?

729
00:45:17,345 --> 00:45:20,342
I saw you with your mom at the pool.

730
00:45:20,442 --> 00:45:22,211
That wasn't my mom.

731
00:45:22,311 --> 00:45:24,309
Oh, yeah? Who was it?

732
00:45:24,409 --> 00:45:25,713
It was an autistic woman.

733
00:45:25,812 --> 00:45:28,112
I take care of her for money.

734
00:45:28,212 --> 00:45:30,445
You shouldn't lie.

735
00:45:30,545 --> 00:45:33,610
I'm not lying. It's the truth.

736
00:45:33,709 --> 00:45:35,978
How old are you?

737
00:45:36,078 --> 00:45:37,844
18.

738
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:40,880
Want one?

739
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,224
Sure.

740
00:45:48,097 --> 00:45:49,085
Heidi?

741
00:45:53,763 --> 00:45:54,751
Heidi?

742
00:46:02,063 --> 00:46:03,393
Heidi!

743
00:46:16,097 --> 00:46:17,176
Why are you coughing?

744
00:46:17,276 --> 00:46:19,025
You haven't even smoked it yet.

745
00:46:26,364 --> 00:46:28,510
I knew you'd never smoked before.

746
00:46:28,609 --> 00:46:29,857
Better go home, boy.

747
00:46:35,563 --> 00:46:37,344
Get your stuff.
We're going right now.

748
00:46:37,445 --> 00:46:39,009
- Now?
- Yeah. Right now.

749
00:46:39,109 --> 00:46:40,176
It's in the middle of the night.

750
00:46:40,276 --> 00:46:42,287
You arguing with me? Move.

751
00:46:46,663 --> 00:46:47,613
Jesus, Heidi,

752
00:46:47,713 --> 00:46:48,876
you can't just walk around

753
00:46:48,976 --> 00:46:50,812
in the middle of the night
by yourself.

754
00:46:50,912 --> 00:46:52,577
You could have been hurt,
kidnapped, who knows?

755
00:46:52,677 --> 00:46:53,776
I said I was sorry.

756
00:46:53,876 --> 00:46:55,111
All right, but what
I want to know is

757
00:46:55,211 --> 00:46:57,629
what the hell you were doing
out there in the first place.

758
00:46:59,264 --> 00:47:00,714
Make me leave your sister alone

759
00:47:00,813 --> 00:47:04,320
in... some hotel.

760
00:47:05,863 --> 00:47:06,942
I couldn't sleep.

761
00:47:07,042 --> 00:47:09,744
You couldn't sleep? Why not?

762
00:47:09,844 --> 00:47:11,728
Why do you think?

763
00:47:15,963 --> 00:47:18,520
Is that why you're falling
asleep in class?

764
00:47:23,863 --> 00:47:25,419
Oh, boy.

765
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:29,196
What do you do every night?

766
00:47:30,364 --> 00:47:32,296
I don't know.

767
00:47:34,397 --> 00:47:35,919
Walk around.

768
00:47:39,663 --> 00:47:42,027
I went to a support group
the other day.

769
00:47:44,397 --> 00:47:46,476
What?

770
00:47:46,575 --> 00:47:49,845
You know, the one they got
at Debbie Sager's house.

771
00:47:49,945 --> 00:47:51,442
For military wives.

772
00:47:51,541 --> 00:47:53,446
I stopped by there the other day.

773
00:47:53,546 --> 00:47:54,860
Isn't that weird?

774
00:47:57,563 --> 00:47:59,979
What did you talk about?

775
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:01,109
Uh-uh. No.

776
00:48:01,209 --> 00:48:02,787
I didn't.

777
00:48:07,596 --> 00:48:09,844
Did it help?

778
00:48:09,944 --> 00:48:11,442
I don't know.

779
00:48:11,541 --> 00:48:13,359
I don't think it did.

780
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:18,446
Will you do me a favor
if you can't sleep?

781
00:48:18,545 --> 00:48:20,462
Um, will you wake me up?

782
00:48:22,364 --> 00:48:23,280
Why?

783
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:26,044
So I can talk to you.

784
00:48:26,144 --> 00:48:27,108
Really?

785
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:28,288
Yeah.

786
00:48:30,197 --> 00:48:31,276
You'd do that?

787
00:48:31,376 --> 00:48:33,409
Yes, I would do that.

788
00:48:33,508 --> 00:48:35,519
Yes.

789
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:50,646
You still want to try it?

790
00:48:50,745 --> 00:48:51,809
With you?

791
00:48:51,909 --> 00:48:53,745
Yeah. I'd rather
you do it with me

792
00:48:53,845 --> 00:48:55,246
than some punk kid.

793
00:48:55,346 --> 00:48:57,646
Well? What's it going to be?

794
00:48:57,745 --> 00:48:59,444
Sure.

795
00:48:59,544 --> 00:49:02,711
Have you ever done this before?

796
00:49:02,811 --> 00:49:04,456
No comment.

797
00:49:30,297 --> 00:49:32,977
Do you want one,
or should we split one?

798
00:49:33,077 --> 00:49:34,446
Let's split one.

799
00:49:34,545 --> 00:49:36,052
Good idea.

800
00:50:02,264 --> 00:50:03,525
Good one.

801
00:50:11,496 --> 00:50:12,710
Oh, are you okay?

802
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:13,728
Yeah.

803
00:50:15,496 --> 00:50:16,427
Are you sure?

804
00:50:18,197 --> 00:50:19,113
Yeah, I'm fine.

805
00:50:19,213 --> 00:50:20,128
Okay.

806
00:50:21,363 --> 00:50:23,727
Maybe we should stop, right?

807
00:50:26,897 --> 00:50:28,475
I'm going to go get some water.

808
00:50:28,575 --> 00:50:29,494
You stay here, okay?

809
00:51:10,363 --> 00:51:14,611
<i># The world could fall apart #</i>

810
00:51:14,711 --> 00:51:19,321
<i># But you're my heart, my dear #</i>

811
00:51:21,797 --> 00:51:25,376
<i># I will sing this song #</i>

812
00:51:25,476 --> 00:51:30,122

813

814

815

Stay together.
I'll be right back.

819
00:51:52,345 --> 00:51:54,509
- I just got to make a phone call.
- Where are you going?

820
00:51:54,609 --> 00:51:56,687
I'll meet you by the dresses.

821
00:52:15,463 --> 00:52:16,379
Hey.

822
00:52:16,479 --> 00:52:18,311
Hey, Dad.

823
00:52:18,411 --> 00:52:19,312
What are those?

824
00:52:19,412 --> 00:52:20,576
Earrings.

825
00:52:20,676 --> 00:52:23,208
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

826
00:52:23,308 --> 00:52:25,746
You said we could get
anything we wanted.

827
00:52:25,846 --> 00:52:27,678
You know the rules.
Not until you're 13.

828
00:52:27,778 --> 00:52:29,112
I'm almost 13.

829
00:52:29,211 --> 00:52:30,821
And I'm 8.

830
00:52:32,429 --> 00:52:34,940
This is something
you really want to do right now?

831
00:52:35,041 --> 00:52:36,018
Yes.

832
00:52:41,496 --> 00:52:42,778
All right. Let's do it.

833
00:52:42,878 --> 00:52:43,875
Okay!

834
00:52:43,975 --> 00:52:44,879
Really?

835
00:52:44,979 --> 00:52:45,951
Yeah.

836
00:52:47,396 --> 00:52:48,509
Is it going to hurt?

837
00:52:48,609 --> 00:52:50,776
You won't even feel
a thing, I promise.

838
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:52,022
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

839
00:52:54,063 --> 00:52:55,878
Did it hurt?

840
00:52:55,978 --> 00:52:57,042
No.

841
00:52:57,141 --> 00:52:58,512
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

842
00:52:58,612 --> 00:52:59,619
That's okay.

843
00:53:03,296 --> 00:53:05,111
Is that it?

844
00:53:05,211 --> 00:53:07,025
That's it. Want to see?

845
00:53:11,863 --> 00:53:13,590
Looks good, Bear.
You're all grown up.

846
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,185
- You next?
- Yeah.

847
00:53:29,596 --> 00:53:31,152
1, 2, 3.

848
00:53:37,129 --> 00:53:38,322
Is that all right?

849
00:53:55,897 --> 00:53:58,761
I just got my ears pierced.

850
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:03,096
That's nice, sweetie.

851
00:54:09,062 --> 00:54:11,012
That looks good.

852
00:54:11,112 --> 00:54:13,028
This one's nice, too.

853
00:54:15,696 --> 00:54:17,477
Did it hurt?

854
00:54:17,577 --> 00:54:18,608
A little.

855
00:54:18,708 --> 00:54:19,876
A little bit?

856
00:54:19,976 --> 00:54:21,724
You did it.

857
00:54:28,563 --> 00:54:29,541
Where's Dawn?

858
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,478
Find her. How much
do I owe you?

859
00:54:31,578 --> 00:54:32,811
Oh. 32.50.

860
00:54:32,911 --> 00:54:34,347
- Dawn?
- Thank you so much.

861
00:54:34,446 --> 00:54:36,224
Dawn!

862
00:54:42,496 --> 00:54:43,542
Dawn?

863
00:54:43,642 --> 00:54:45,721
Dawn?

864
00:54:49,797 --> 00:54:50,820
Dawn!

865
00:54:51,963 --> 00:54:53,656
Bear, where are you?

866
00:54:58,062 --> 00:55:00,108
Dawn! Bear!

867
00:55:00,208 --> 00:55:02,855
Dawn Amber Phillips!

868
00:55:05,996 --> 00:55:07,223
See if she's over there.

869
00:55:11,296 --> 00:55:13,057
Bear.

870
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:24,723
Dawn, honey, what are you
doing in there?

871
00:55:26,129 --> 00:55:27,822
Dawn, are you all right?

872
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:30,857
Dawn.

873
00:55:40,696 --> 00:55:42,389
Anybody home?

874
00:55:48,596 --> 00:55:49,823
Come in.

875
00:56:03,996 --> 00:56:05,210
Hey.

876
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:06,476
Hey.

877
00:56:06,576 --> 00:56:07,912
This is a nice place.

878
00:56:08,011 --> 00:56:08,946
This really is.

879
00:56:09,046 --> 00:56:10,507
You decorate it yourself?

880
00:56:10,607 --> 00:56:12,574
No.

881
00:56:12,674 --> 00:56:15,410
Well, it's really, really nice.

882
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:18,345
It's a nice little house.

883
00:56:18,445 --> 00:56:22,088
Nice walls, nice... nice roof.

884
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,510
Phone.

885
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:28,574
I could see a nice little
happy family living here.

886
00:56:28,674 --> 00:56:29,822
Yeah.

887
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:36,944
You miss home.

888
00:56:37,043 --> 00:56:38,290
Yeah.

889
00:56:42,096 --> 00:56:43,891
I miss Mom, too.

890
00:56:52,296 --> 00:56:53,274
You know, I was thinking.

891
00:56:53,374 --> 00:56:54,712
Maybe this would be a good thing

892
00:56:54,812 --> 00:56:55,774
to get for the house.

893
00:56:55,874 --> 00:56:56,976
You could put it up

894
00:56:57,075 --> 00:56:58,551
in you and your sister's room.

895
00:57:00,129 --> 00:57:01,607
Would you like that?

896
00:57:01,707 --> 00:57:02,821
Mm-hmm.

897
00:57:10,996 --> 00:57:13,008
I love you, Dad.

898
00:57:13,108 --> 00:57:15,221
I love you, too, Bear.

899
00:57:32,563 --> 00:57:33,654
Come here.

900
00:57:40,696 --> 00:57:42,444
Dad?

901
00:57:42,544 --> 00:57:43,791
Yeah.

902
00:57:45,663 --> 00:57:46,822
You smell.

903
00:57:47,862 --> 00:57:49,711
I think I like this one.

904
00:57:49,812 --> 00:57:50,785
Try it.

905
00:58:03,962 --> 00:58:05,928
Looks pretty nice.

906
00:58:12,663 --> 00:58:13,877
Hey, Dad.

907
00:58:13,976 --> 00:58:14,878
Yeah.

908
00:58:14,978 --> 00:58:16,575
What do you do at work all day?

909
00:58:16,676 --> 00:58:18,208
I sell shit.

910
00:58:18,308 --> 00:58:19,212
Dad.

911
00:58:19,312 --> 00:58:20,246
I'm sorry.

912
00:58:20,346 --> 00:58:21,245
I sell stuff.

913
00:58:21,345 --> 00:58:22,509
You know what I do.

914
00:58:22,609 --> 00:58:24,512
I sell stuff at Home Store.

915
00:58:24,612 --> 00:58:26,675
Come on. Give me an H.

916
00:58:26,775 --> 00:58:27,809
O.

917
00:58:27,908 --> 00:58:29,374
Give me an O.

918
00:58:29,474 --> 00:58:30,379
O.

919
00:58:30,479 --> 00:58:31,913
- Give me an M.
- M.

920
00:58:32,012 --> 00:58:33,041
- Give me an E.
- E.

921
00:58:33,141 --> 00:58:34,045
Give me an S.

922
00:58:34,145 --> 00:58:35,045
- J.
- S.

923
00:58:35,145 --> 00:58:36,512
- Give me a T.
- Q.

924
00:58:36,612 --> 00:58:37,945
Give me an O-R-E.

925
00:58:38,044 --> 00:58:38,945
O-R-E.

926
00:58:39,045 --> 00:58:40,277
What's that spell?

927
00:58:40,377 --> 00:58:42,144
Nothing.

928
00:58:42,244 --> 00:58:43,808
You're right about that.

929
00:58:43,908 --> 00:58:47,110
<i>#...hold you in my arms #</i>

930
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:48,545
<i># It scares me #</i>

931
00:58:48,645 --> 00:58:53,209
<i># Just to think that</i>
<i>something so beautiful #</i>

932
00:58:53,309 --> 00:58:57,853
<i># Could just come apart in my hands #</i>

933
00:59:00,563 --> 00:59:04,655
<i># I've always been chasin' rainbows #</i>

934
00:59:08,396 --> 00:59:10,009
How are you feeling, excited?

935
00:59:10,109 --> 00:59:11,512
You getting excited?

936
00:59:11,612 --> 00:59:12,642
Yeah.

937
00:59:12,741 --> 00:59:14,207
Good.

938
00:59:14,307 --> 00:59:15,443
How are you feeling?

939
00:59:15,543 --> 00:59:16,860
I'm good.

940
00:59:22,596 --> 00:59:23,574
Dad?

941
00:59:23,674 --> 00:59:26,095
Hmm?

942
00:59:27,196 --> 00:59:28,208
Do you ever think

943
00:59:28,308 --> 00:59:30,592
that Mom should have stayed home?

944
00:59:32,996 --> 00:59:34,394
All the time.

945
00:59:37,029 --> 00:59:39,551
Why did she have to go?

946
00:59:42,429 --> 00:59:45,379
She was doing her duty,
Heidi, you know that.

947
00:59:45,479 --> 00:59:47,846
I know, but what exactly
does that mean?

948
00:59:47,945 --> 00:59:51,244
We've talked about this.

949
00:59:51,344 --> 00:59:53,077
We have people all over the world

950
00:59:53,177 --> 00:59:54,910
looking out for our safety.

951
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:56,474
When they discover a threat,

952
00:59:56,574 --> 00:59:58,013
they have to act on it.

953
00:59:58,112 --> 00:59:59,843
That's the way the world is.

954
00:59:59,943 --> 01:00:01,109
On the news they're saying

955
01:00:01,209 --> 01:00:02,943
that we went to war
with the wrong people,

956
01:00:03,043 --> 01:00:04,810
that it was all a lie.

957
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:05,975
Well, you can't always believe

958
01:00:06,075 --> 01:00:08,358
everything you hear
on television, can you?

959
01:00:09,962 --> 01:00:11,311
Sometimes you just got to trust

960
01:00:11,411 --> 01:00:12,678
that you're doing the right thing.

961
01:00:12,777 --> 01:00:14,251
We got to believe...

962
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:22,223
Well, what if you can't?

963
01:00:26,329 --> 01:00:28,124
Then we're all lost.

964
01:01:34,096 --> 01:01:36,574
<i>Hi. You've reached Grace, Stanley,</i>

965
01:01:36,673 --> 01:01:37,775
<i>Heidi, and Dawn.</i>

966
01:01:37,875 --> 01:01:38,941
<i>We're not home right now,</i>

967
01:01:39,041 --> 01:01:40,344
<i>but if you leave a message,</i>

968
01:01:40,444 --> 01:01:42,508
<i>we'll get back to you</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

969
01:01:42,607 --> 01:01:45,074
Hey. It's Stanley and the girls.

970
01:01:45,174 --> 01:01:47,876
I just wanted to hear
your voice on the machine

971
01:01:47,976 --> 01:01:50,008
and tell you that we're all right.

972
01:01:50,108 --> 01:01:51,810
We're in Florida.

973
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:54,094
I told you we were
going to Florida, right?

974
01:01:54,194 --> 01:01:57,512
Taking the girls on a little trip.

975
01:01:57,611 --> 01:01:59,511
Anyway, do you
remember that, uh...

976
01:01:59,611 --> 01:02:01,573
I was thinking that when we...

977
01:02:01,673 --> 01:02:04,977
when we came down here
before you shipped out,

978
01:02:05,077 --> 01:02:08,040
and I just...
I wanted to apologize

979
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:10,012
because, uh...

980
01:02:10,112 --> 01:02:12,141
because I was so angry back then,

981
01:02:12,241 --> 01:02:15,207
and, uh, I just wanted to let you know

982
01:02:15,307 --> 01:02:16,510
I was thinking that...

983
01:02:16,609 --> 01:02:19,012
that the reason I was so angry

984
01:02:19,112 --> 01:02:21,960
was because I was ashamed...

985
01:02:23,729 --> 01:02:26,544
that it was you
who was going and not me.

986
01:02:26,644 --> 01:02:29,012
We would have been
better off if it was me.

987
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:31,344
The girls would have
been better off.

988
01:02:31,444 --> 01:02:34,407
And I made such a fucking
mess out of this thing.

989
01:02:34,507 --> 01:02:37,446
Grace, I'm such a mess.

990
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:40,344
I... I don't...

991
01:02:40,445 --> 01:02:42,657
know how to talk to these girls.

992
01:02:44,329 --> 01:02:46,227
I haven't even told them.

993
01:02:48,695 --> 01:02:53,389
So you got to tell me
what to do... Grace.

994
01:02:55,296 --> 01:02:57,043
<i>Please, God, tell me what to do.</i>

995
01:02:57,143 --> 01:02:59,788
<i>So how do I say it?</i>

996
01:03:02,829 --> 01:03:04,886
You got to tell me what to do.

997
01:03:10,363 --> 01:03:11,678
Who were you talking to?

998
01:03:11,777 --> 01:03:13,240
School.

999
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:14,818
Mrs. Shimerhorn.

1000
01:03:15,929 --> 01:03:16,941
Mrs. Shimerhorn?

1001
01:03:17,041 --> 01:03:18,344
She said everything's
going to be fine

1002
01:03:18,444 --> 01:03:20,475
but we got to get that report in

1003
01:03:20,574 --> 01:03:23,012
and do a couple
of makeup assignments,

1004
01:03:23,112 --> 01:03:24,445
but, uh, to enjoy the trip.

1005
01:03:24,544 --> 01:03:25,642
So let's go.

1006
01:03:25,742 --> 01:03:26,741
Come on.

1007
01:03:26,841 --> 01:03:27,817
Load up!

1008
01:03:50,495 --> 01:03:52,175
- Are we there yet?
- No.

1009
01:03:52,276 --> 01:03:53,179
- Are we there yet?
- Mm-mmm.

1010
01:03:53,279 --> 01:03:54,875
- Are we there yet?
- No.

1011
01:03:54,975 --> 01:03:56,244
- Are we there yet?
- Mm.

1012
01:03:56,344 --> 01:03:57,509
- Are we there yet?
- No.

1013
01:03:57,608 --> 01:03:58,775
- Are we there yet?
- No.

1014
01:03:58,875 --> 01:03:59,812
Are we there yet?

1015
01:03:59,912 --> 01:04:00,812
No.

1016
01:04:00,912 --> 01:04:02,009
- Are we there yet?
- No.

1017
01:04:02,109 --> 01:04:03,175
Are we there yet?

1018
01:04:03,275 --> 01:04:04,275
No!

1019
01:04:04,375 --> 01:04:05,522
Are we there yet?

1020
01:04:07,363 --> 01:04:08,488
How about now?

1021
01:04:11,996 --> 01:04:13,278
Oh, it's right there!

1022
01:04:13,378 --> 01:04:16,442
It's right there!
Oh, my gosh, Dad!

1023
01:04:16,541 --> 01:04:19,608
Step on it, old man!

1024
01:04:19,708 --> 01:04:22,308
There it is, Heidi!

1025
01:04:22,409 --> 01:04:25,009
It's right there!

1026
01:04:25,109 --> 01:04:27,310
What ride do you
want to go on first?

1027
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:29,123
Mission accomplished.

1028
01:04:33,996 --> 01:04:36,075
I wonder if they have a TV there.

1029
01:04:36,175 --> 01:04:37,822
They probably do.

1030
01:04:49,296 --> 01:04:51,841
It's all yours.
Take your pick.

1031
01:04:51,941 --> 01:04:55,986
Welcome to the Enchanted Hotel.

1032
01:04:58,062 --> 01:05:00,040
Enchanted Gardens!

1033
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:02,079
Enchanted Gardens!

1034
01:05:02,179 --> 01:05:04,288
Enchanted Gardens!

1035
01:05:20,062 --> 01:05:21,209
All right, girls.

1036
01:05:21,309 --> 01:05:24,274
Uh, just don't stay up
all night, okay?

1037
01:05:24,373 --> 01:05:25,677
- Okay, Dad.
- Because we got to get...

1038
01:05:25,777 --> 01:05:27,044
We got to get some sleep

1039
01:05:27,144 --> 01:05:28,641
because we've got
a big day tomorrow, okay?

1040
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:29,888
Okay.

1041
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:34,053
Big day.

1042
01:05:37,229 --> 01:05:39,388
Let's stay up all night.

1043
01:05:41,662 --> 01:05:43,184
Okay.

1075
01:08:08,328 --> 01:08:09,953
- Hey.
- Hey.

1076
01:08:23,228 --> 01:08:24,544
You look like you're ready to go.

1077
01:08:24,644 --> 01:08:26,444
I am.

1078
01:08:26,544 --> 01:08:28,041
Oh, that dress looks pretty.

1079
01:08:28,141 --> 01:08:29,045
Thanks.

1080
01:08:29,145 --> 01:08:30,045
Where's your sister?

1081
01:08:30,145 --> 01:08:31,607
Outside.

1082
01:08:31,706 --> 01:08:33,388
Outside doing what?

1083
01:08:34,529 --> 01:08:36,979
I don't know.
Some Heidi thing.

1084
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:38,843
Oh, right.

1085
01:08:38,943 --> 01:08:40,361
Ooh.

1086
01:08:43,896 --> 01:08:44,827
Okay.

1087
01:09:04,962 --> 01:09:07,155
What are you doing
out here all by yourself?

1088
01:09:16,562 --> 01:09:19,141
You all right, sweetheart?

1089
01:09:19,241 --> 01:09:22,043
Yeah. How are you?

1090
01:09:22,143 --> 01:09:24,356
Me? I'm just fine.

1091
01:09:26,062 --> 01:09:27,141
Just fine.

1092
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,807
Slept like a rock,

1093
01:09:29,908 --> 01:09:31,294
which is good.

1094
01:09:33,462 --> 01:09:35,744
You know your sister's
just about ready to burst,

1095
01:09:35,844 --> 01:09:37,295
she's so excited.

1096
01:09:40,395 --> 01:09:42,109
What do you think?
You want to get going?

1097
01:09:42,209 --> 01:09:43,717
Sure. Sure.

1098
01:09:47,195 --> 01:09:48,145
Dad?

1099
01:09:48,245 --> 01:09:49,455
Yeah.

1100
01:09:51,996 --> 01:09:53,189
Nothing.

1101
01:10:15,462 --> 01:10:17,451
Have an enchanted day.

1102
01:10:25,695 --> 01:10:27,112
This way...

1103
01:10:27,211 --> 01:10:28,627
or this way?

1104
01:11:13,228 --> 01:11:14,307
Do you want this balloon?

1105
01:11:14,407 --> 01:11:15,474
Yeah. I like blue.

1106
01:11:15,574 --> 01:11:16,877
I don't know.
This is kind of...

1107
01:11:16,977 --> 01:11:18,041
This is a powerful balloon.

1108
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,044
I don't know if I
should let you hold it.

1109
01:11:20,144 --> 01:11:21,044
Whoa!
Ha ha ha!

1110
01:11:21,144 --> 01:11:22,207
That's a big balloon.

1111
01:11:22,307 --> 01:11:23,610
Heidi, Heidi,
hold your sister.

1112
01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:24,808
Hold your sister down.

1113
01:11:24,908 --> 01:11:25,812
Hold her. Hold her.

1114
01:11:25,912 --> 01:11:27,192
The wind's going
to take her away.

1115
01:12:28,328 --> 01:12:29,918
What do you want to do now?

1116
01:12:31,128 --> 01:12:32,606
Let's go.

1117
01:12:32,706 --> 01:12:34,490
Yeah.

1118
01:12:37,128 --> 01:12:38,560
You want to leave?

1119
01:12:39,896 --> 01:12:43,385
I did everything
I wanted to do.

1120
01:12:47,595 --> 01:12:48,856
Okay.

1121
01:12:52,028 --> 01:12:53,255
Come on.

1122
01:14:08,061 --> 01:14:10,186
Why aren't we on the highway?

1123
01:14:24,328 --> 01:14:25,817
Let's get out of the car.

1124
01:14:45,462 --> 01:14:46,984
Sit down.

1125
01:15:07,195 --> 01:15:09,525
I need to tell you something...

1126
01:15:11,595 --> 01:15:14,720
and it's something I should
have told you a lot earlier.

1127
01:15:19,629 --> 01:15:22,944
You know your mother and I
love you very, very, very much.

1128
01:15:23,043 --> 01:15:24,051
Dawn.

1129
01:15:25,762 --> 01:15:26,678
Yeah.

1130
01:15:26,777 --> 01:15:28,739
Nothing's ever
going to change that.

1131
01:15:28,839 --> 01:15:30,418
Ever.

1132
01:15:35,961 --> 01:15:38,378
Do you remember
when we talked about things

1133
01:15:38,478 --> 01:15:41,394
that could happen
while she was away?

1134
01:15:45,761 --> 01:15:47,989
Well, your mother was hurt.

1135
01:15:49,928 --> 01:15:52,709
She was hurt real bad.

1136
01:15:52,809 --> 01:15:54,273
Where is she?

1137
01:15:54,373 --> 01:15:58,340
She was hurt so bad,
they couldn't fix her.

1138
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:00,676
She's just hurt, right?

1139
01:16:00,775 --> 01:16:01,874
Dad.

1140
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:02,877
She's just hurt.

1141
01:16:02,977 --> 01:16:03,877
Where is she?

1142
01:16:03,977 --> 01:16:05,175
It's okay, Dawn.

1143
01:16:05,275 --> 01:16:06,774
We'll take care of her.
She's just hurt.

1144
01:16:06,873 --> 01:16:08,744
Your mom is a soldier,

1145
01:16:08,844 --> 01:16:11,076
and soldiers sometimes get hurt,

1146
01:16:11,176 --> 01:16:13,741
and sometimes they even...

1147
01:16:13,841 --> 01:16:15,143
die in battle.

1148
01:16:15,243 --> 01:16:16,989
And that's what happened.

1149
01:17:56,995 --> 01:17:58,411
<i>Grace Ann Phillips</i>

1150
01:17:58,511 --> 01:18:03,052
<i>was born in Newport, Indiana,</i>
<i>on October 3, 1971.</i>

1151
01:18:04,328 --> 01:18:05,941
<i>She was a happy child</i>

1152
01:18:06,041 --> 01:18:08,445
<i>who loved spending time outdoors.</i>

1153
01:18:08,545 --> 01:18:11,276
<i>Once she even spent</i>
<i>an entire summer</i>

1154
01:18:11,376 --> 01:18:13,312
<i>sleeping in a refrigerator box</i>

1155
01:18:13,412 --> 01:18:15,243
<i>in her mother's backyard.</i>

1156
01:18:15,343 --> 01:18:18,211
<i>She waterproofed it</i>
<i>with garbage bags</i>

1157
01:18:18,311 --> 01:18:20,693
<i>so she could sleep in it</i>
<i>even when it rained.</i>

1158
01:18:23,562 --> 01:18:25,377
<i>Grace was a brave woman.</i>

1159
01:18:25,477 --> 01:18:29,007
<i>She enlisted in the Army</i>
<i>right out of high school.</i>

1160
01:18:29,107 --> 01:18:31,573
<i>She met my father, Stanley Phillips,</i>

1161
01:18:31,672 --> 01:18:33,808
<i>at boot camp</i>
<i>in Fort Knox, Kentucky,</i>

1162
01:18:33,908 --> 01:18:36,041
<i>later that summer.</i>

1163
01:18:36,141 --> 01:18:38,185
<i>They married after training was over.</i>

1164
01:18:40,395 --> 01:18:42,345
<i>My father says that, to this day,</i>

1165
01:18:42,445 --> 01:18:45,311
<i>he's still surprised Mom said yes,</i>

1166
01:18:45,411 --> 01:18:46,907
<i>which is funny</i>
<i>because Mom used to tell</i>

1167
01:18:47,006 --> 01:18:48,641
<i>my sister and me</i>
<i>she was worried</i>

1168
01:18:48,741 --> 01:18:52,239
<i>he was never going</i>
<i>to ask the big question.</i>

1169
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:55,509
<i>Grace and Stanley loved</i>
<i>each other very much.</i>

1170
01:18:55,608 --> 01:18:57,287
<i>They were best friends.</i>

1171
01:18:59,594 --> 01:19:00,943
<i>Anyone who knew Grace</i>

1172
01:19:01,043 --> 01:19:02,960
<i>knows she was a special person.</i>

1173
01:19:04,628 --> 01:19:08,240
She was kind, generous, and funny.

1174
01:19:08,341 --> 01:19:09,907
She had a loud, silly laugh

1175
01:19:10,007 --> 01:19:11,007
you could hear

1176
01:19:11,107 --> 01:19:12,573
even when you were
in the next room.

1177
01:19:12,672 --> 01:19:14,991
And she could sing
better than anyone.

1178
01:19:16,362 --> 01:19:18,407
We'll miss her very much,

1179
01:19:18,507 --> 01:19:20,378
but we promise
to always think of you

1180
01:19:20,478 --> 01:19:22,108
when we laugh, wake up,

1181
01:19:22,208 --> 01:19:23,673
fall asleep,

1182
01:19:23,772 --> 01:19:25,488
and look at the ocean.

1183
01:19:27,328 --> 01:19:30,158
<i>I promise to keep your memory</i>
<i>with us forever.</i>

1184
01:19:33,095 --> 01:19:35,741
Is it time?

1185
01:19:35,841 --> 01:19:37,691
Not yet.

1186
01:19:39,362 --> 01:19:40,884
Okay, get ready.

1187
01:20:10,795 --> 01:20:15,023
<i># Can't find all the words yet #</i>

1188

1192

1193
01:20:45,111 --> 01:20:50,775

1194
01:20:50,875 --> 01:20:55,623

1195
01:20:56,995 --> 01:21:03,608

1196

1201

1202
