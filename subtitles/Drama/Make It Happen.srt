{49600}{49677}Well, I got the perfect place.
{49810}{49890}Growing up, my mom used|to tell me stories about Chicago,
{49895}{49977}the lights, energy, the people.
{49980}{50050}She dreamed of coming here|and being a dancer.
{50052}{50145}- That's where you got the moves from.|- Yep. She studied to be one.
{50150}{50257}Chose to be a mom instead.|So she passed the dream down to me.
{50260}{50337}- Is she still in Glenwood?|- No, no. She passed away.
{50390}{50447}I'm sorry.
{50452}{50540}She got pretty sick when I was about 10,
{50542}{50625}and it took a lot out of us,|especially my dad.
{50630}{50732}After Mom, he just...|spent all his time in the garage.
{50752}{50817}He said it kept his mind off missing her.
{50867}{50930}And then one night, three years ago,
{50932}{51005}I was coming back to the garage|after a recital.
{51010}{51112}Joel was in lndy picking up equipment|and he'd asked me to stay with Dad.
{51115}{51215}But some dancer friends|wanted to go out to dinner.
{51220}{51282}Later when I did get to the garage...
{51320}{51382}... I found him on the floor.
{51385}{51447}He'd had a heart attack.
{51500}{51565}I always wonder if I'd just got there|10 minutes earlier...
{51567}{51637}You can't do that to yourself.
{51667}{51797}After that, I put school on hold|to stay and help Joel out with the shop.
{51800}{51887}Since losing Dad,|it's just been the two of us.
{51927}{51987}That had to be hard.
